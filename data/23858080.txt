First you will be greeted by an aggressive baoan. Then you will experience a series of poorly considered interior design choices. The sink without water pressure, far away from the mirror, the faulty shower head, the cracked bathroom floor, the poorly lit elevator button. And if you're  not lucky, you will have on going public street works on front of the swimming pool, where it takes over an hour to be served. 

It is not normal to queue for a hotel breakfast. The list goes on. If you are looking for a relaxing stay, this is not the place.

Although the hotel was opened in 2018, the facilities are still well maintained and quite new, and the hygiene is also well handled, but the room air conditioner cannot be adjusted and the temperature is fixed. The only shortcoming of the hotel is that the breakfast in the restaurant is really too ordinary. The hot meat area can be basically all vegetarian dishes. There were many people dining on Saturday, and the replacement was not timely. The plates were empty and they were left empty. It took more than half an hour to replace a dish, and it was fried vegetarian. Even the Hilton Garden Inn, which provided breakfast, can't beat it. .

msg:Meet the service angel Eason: a warm experience that makes you feel at home.
Eason at the front desk greets every guest with his signature smile. His service is not only superficial enthusiasm, but also contains patience and meticulousness, which makes people let go of their guard and immerse themselves in this comfortable experience.
Every corner is filled with Eason's care. Eason also provided us with bubble baths and rose baths, which not only soothe the tired body and mind of adults, but also satisfy the innocent joy of children. When I saw the children laughing in the bubble bath, as a parent, my heart was full of gratitude.
Eason's personality is like a friend who can always see through your needs. Without saying much, he can always think of what you want in advance. When going out on rainy days, he will remind you to bring an umbrella through WeChat; when night falls, he will send a warm goodnight soup. Every little move shows his thoughtfulness and professionalism.
Eason's service is reflected in the following points:
1. Listening and observing - pay close attention to the needs and preferences of guests.
2. Personalized service - provide customized services according to different guests.
3. Surprises beyond expectations - Add small surprises such as goodnight soup on top of standard services.
4. Pay attention to details - Small details such as reminding customers to bring umbrellas on rainy days show care.
5. Smile service - Use a sincere smile to create a friendly first impression.
In summary, Eason's service is not only a display of professionalism, but also a reflection of his personality. He made our stay extremely comfortable and unforgettable. We should give more encouragement and affirmation to such a warm and lovely front desk supervisor.

The hotel front desk, concierge, and restaurant services are all very young, but very positive and proactive! It's the first time I've seen the smile and enthusiasm of the neighbor aunt in a Hilton brand! The hotel team is young and energetic! High cost performance! What amazed me most was their catering. The breakfast food was fresh. The only drawback was that the soy sauce fried rice for breakfast was unstable. It was dry and hard today! The Chinese vegetables were fresh, and the tomato beef was very tasty. The sweet and sour tomato was integrated with the fresh beef. Not many stores obviously added the two categories together! Hilton's catering was not acceptable to me. I didn't expect that it really felt good this time, and the price was not high. Compared with some black pearls, it is more worth experiencing! The catering of their group's Waldorf has always been criticized!

There are many parking spaces and the parking lot is very clean and large! There is no need to wait for the reception at the lobby front desk. Manager Bertha is super nice and enthusiastic. She also upgraded the room directly because the Turkish friend who was traveling with me was fluent in English. She was polite and interesting. She also helped to order dinner and send menus in the evening. 5 stars⭐ praise directly! The most important room is also very good. The standard facilities of various hotels are superb. The fully automatic TOTO toilet 🚽 exceeds 99.99% of Hilton Hilton. I especially like the stool and sofa at the end of the bed. The fabric & solid wood & design sense are superb! The bedding is also OK, very comfortable! ... I recommend everyone to try the beef brisket noodles and dried radish for breakfast. It's superb. The little sister helped me fill a large cup of greasy American coffee with my own cup☕. I was touched. Later, the customer and I felt that it tasted much better than the Starbucks we drank at noon! The best thing about this trip to Xiamen is the hotel. I highly recommend it to my friends.

msg:After doing a lot of comparisons on a certain book and Ctrip, I chose this one. It usually takes about 20 minutes to get there by taxi from the airport (there was a bit of traffic when I went there, so I could get there in about 30 minutes). First of all, the location is very good, right next to the beach of Zengcuo'an. You can see the beach in 1 minute when you go out, but it is not directly facing the beach. It is hidden on the second side, which gives you a feeling of quietness in the hustle and bustle. The transportation is very convenient. There are two stations outside, which can go directly to Xiamen University and the cruise terminal. If the traffic on the road is congested during holidays, it is also a good choice to take a bus and slowly enjoy the scenery along the way. This time I stayed in a double room, without sea view. The room is quite large, and two people can walk around in it without affecting each other. The bathroom is separated into dry and wet areas, with a shower and a bathtub, and the toilet is an automatic sensor toilet. The wash basin does have the problems mentioned in other reviews. The faucet is too short, and water will splash out when washing hands. The two sinks next to the basin are full of water and will flow to the ground. There is basically no problem if you put a floor towel on the two corners of the ground. The breakfast is also good. I recommend beef brisket noodles and shacha seafood noodles (noodles are better than noodles). The dishes are replenished quite promptly. I was worried that there would be too many guests staying in the hotel during the holidays and the service would not be able to keep up. It turned out that my worries were unnecessary. The overall experience was very good, and the local restaurants recommended by the hotel were also very delicious. The only shortcoming is that the sanitary dead corners need to be fixed, but everything else is good.

msg:The worst hotel I've ever stayed in Xiamen, the worst pitfall I've ever stepped on! Ctrip has become like Xiaohongshu now, and the reviews are too fake. The room price of 1,600 yuan is not as good as Atour's 600 yuan, and the breakfast is even more outrageous, 168? Ask yourself if it's worth it. I saw with my own eyes that they cut the pickled mustard tuber that costs a few cents a bag and put it on the plate. At least they should use the branded ones that cost one or two yuan a bag. The limited white porridge that can be eaten depends on it.

Environment: Is it really good to use pirated Hermes furniture in the hotel lobby? Those who say that the hotel has a sense of design, are they referring to such unscrupulous soft furnishings?
Facilities: The room is moldy in various ways, and the whitewashing of the toilet is also very sloppy. If the room price is a few hundred yuan, you can ignore it
Service: I asked for an extra quilt and it took two days to deliver it. The service level needs to be improved

msg:The room is not big, but it is relatively big in Xiamen. The room on the sixth floor has a view of the sea. The hygiene is good, the service is very warm, and the front desk, concierge and the room aunt are also very polite. The bathroom door in the room cannot be closed, and you have to be very careful not to splash water out. It is a pity that the swimming pool has been under maintenance and cannot be used. The Western pastries for breakfast are delicious and rich, and they are basically different for three days, but the Chinese dishes are relatively monotonous, and the dishes seem to have been cooked for a long time. It is within walking distance of Zengcuo'an. Crossing the road from the hotel is the beach of Xiamen Calligraphy Square. It is very convenient to run on the beach in the morning.

msg:Because I came to Xiamen with my friends for a trip. The hotel I booked a few days ago was very average and not very clean. I wanted to stay in a better hotel for the last night, so I found this Hilton Garden Inn. As soon as I entered the lobby, I could see that it was better to stay at an expensive one. There were hotel staff at the boarding and alighting area to help with luggage and say hello. Xiao Su at the front desk was very dedicated and the check-in was very fast. Haha, he also served me when I checked out. Very good work attitude! I felt very comfortable as soon as I opened the door. The room was very bright. There was a large French window. It was convenient to put on makeup depending on the weather. The bathroom was super dry and wet separated. Hahaha, they were different doors. The toilet was still automatic and scared me. The washbasin was very large, which was very convenient for washing. The disposable products were very complete and there was also body lotion. There was a big bathtub at the entrance. Although I didn't experience the bubble bath due to time constraints, hahaha, and the floor drain under the bathroom was embedded? It feels more hygienic. This hotel also has its own makeup mirror, which is very convenient for girls to put on makeup. The hotel service is also very good. My companion was scalded, and I called the front desk to ask if there was any burn oin**ent. He immediately brought it up. It was a brand new big tube. The quilt they gave was also thick. Many hotels give very thin quilts as extra gifts, which is not very friendly to people like me who like to cover themselves with thick quilts. In short, the experience in this hotel is full, and it can be regarded as a successful trip. Although the scenery outside the floor-to-ceiling window has always been windy and rainy, hahahaha, I hope to see sunny days next time~

A reliable housekeeper contacted us one day in advance to consult our needs, prepare for our trip in advance, and arrange a room on the same floor for us, with 6666 service! The environment is also very good, comfortable and suitable for vacation. It is within walking distance of major attractions. It is really affordable! The facilities in the room are also complete, and you can eat famous local snacks in the room, which is great, and it's free.

msg:A great stay experience. After graduating from Xiamen University and returning to my alma mater, I have been struggling to find a large hotel with at least 4 stars or above in Zengcuo'an🏨. It is generally surrounded by famous hotels. Although it is cheap, it is really noisy, regardless of the room. No matter the soundproofing or the noise around you, you can't sleep peacefully. This Hilton is great👏, but the breakfast is too slim! The swimming pool is also under maintenance, so there is no experience. The complimentary Minnan deluxe set meal for two is so delicious😋! Next time I will book directly using the Hilton app, hoping to delay check-out until 16:00 and continue to be surprised, thank you🙏 Finally, give your cleaning lady a thumbs up👍

Everyone here including the cleaning lady will greet you with a smile and make you feel at home. Liu Kaiyun, the very considerate housekeeper, warmly invited me to participate in the Earth Hour yoga event, but refused because I was pregnant. After knowing that I was an expectant mother, the housekeeper thoughtfully arranged a fruit for me and said that expectant mothers should supplement it every day. Nutrition, thank you again Kaiyun for your service! I like the design of the room very much, and the hotel's breakfast is also very Xiamen-style, including sand tea noodles, noodle paste, and Nan Putuo pie, which are all very delicious! In the end, they extended the check-out time for us so that we would not be in a hurry on the last day. I felt full of enthusiasm during the few days I stayed. In addition, the hotel is only three to five minutes from the beach, which is very convenient ~ I will choose to bring my family here next time!

First of all, the staff at the hotel took into account our actual situation and gave us good suggestions, which saved us a lot of money. In addition, since our flight was in the late afternoon, they arranged a late check-out for us. The room has a shower and bath, and disposable bath covers and bath balls are also provided. The dry area sink is also a very considerate design outside the bathroom. TOTO's automatic toilet is very good! The hotel's very Minnan package is also very cost-effective. The room is very quiet, and the front desk will thoughtfully ask if you want a room near or far from the elevator. I would like to express my special thanks to Bertha, who even cared about whether our stay was going well and whether we had any needs during the rest days. It was really a great value and considerate service. Aunt Cao from the guest service was also very nice and even helped us deliver towels and other things very late at night. All in all, I highly recommend Hilton Curio! By the way, it's super close to Zengcuo'an, within walking distance, and also to the beach. It's really convenient!

The lady named Lin at the front desk is very patient in her work. It was during the Spring Festival when I went there. Although there were many customers, it was obvious that she was very patient in helping each guest solve their problems. The lady named Wang in the breakfast restaurant remembered that I was the first person to check in, and carefully helped me reserve a seat during breakfast, thus avoiding the embarrassment of being the first person to take the meal. The room aunt and room manager I met in the corridor always said hello every time I saw them, so I give full marks for the service. There are some minor flaws in the room maintenance, but the overall flaws are not concealed. I look forward to staying here again next time I go to Xiamen.

The subway is being built nearby, but I don't know if it is because of the holiday. There is no noise and it is very quiet. The hotel service is good and in line with expectations. The breakfast can only be said to be average, not very rich. Because it was winter, no one was swimming in the outdoor swimming pool. However, the floor of the swimming pool was peeling and it was still not repaired. It felt like there was still a problem with the maintenance of the facilities. The minibar only has Coke and Sprite, which is a bit low. Overall, the price/performance ratio is pretty good. After all, the prices nearby are over 1,000 for all seasons.

msg:To be honest, this hotel stay was unpleasant from the beginning. I placed an order on Ctrip, and then the front desk said I didn’t see the order, so I asked a friend to help me place one. As a result, while waiting, the hotel front desk said they saw the order, but I didn’t. I didn’t know which platform the order was from, so I had to check in first. After I put my luggage down, I went out with my girlfriend. My girlfriend bought a local gift. The delivery guy didn’t know where to put it so he called the front desk. The front desk said he could just come back and pick it up at the concierge in the evening, so we came back in the evening to prepare. We went to pick up the flash delivery and asked the concierge first. The concierge said that he did not see the flash delivery package, so he communicated with the front desk. The front desk said that he did not see it either and asked us to communicate with the concierge. This was obviously a shift between the afternoon and evening shift staff. It was a mistake caused by imperfect communication on the matter. It took more than ten minutes to find the package in the lobby on the first floor. The package was not registered at the concierge. Then I went back to the room to take a shower and rest. As a result, the soundproof corridor was very noisy during the rest. When I checked in from the afternoon, the front desk explained to me that our room was going to be arranged on the third and fourth floors, but there were no rooms. They said that we would be arranged on the second floor. Floor, said the second floor is very quiet. It would not affect our rest, so we arranged our room to the elevator entrance on the second floor. Room 203, passengers coming and going from the corridor! Moreover, the sound insulation is very poor and it is very noisy. At one o'clock in the morning, the quarrel next door can be clearly heard. Then in the morning, the curtains actually let light through? Can you believe that the normal room price is 1,000 per night, not to mention in Xiamen, at this price in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, the curtains will not let light through? The only thing worth mentioning is that the efficiency of the night service at night is very good. I was woken up by a quarrel with the guests next to me at one o'clock in the morning. I just got up to drink water, but found that it was not available. I asked the front desk to deliver water. It was delivered at a very early time, which may be just right. The room is at the elevator entrance (dog head saves life). Why did we choose this hotel? Because we stayed at the Waldorf Astoria two days before we stayed in Xiamen. They are both Hilton hotels. I was very satisfied with the hotel experience. I had something to do later and had to stay in Xiamen. I stayed for one more day, but the Waldorf Astoria room had already been checked out. I just wanted to experience other Hilton hotels in Xiamen. After reading Xiaohongshu’s recommendation, I chose the Hilton instead of the Conrad. As a result, the experience gap was too big, and there was no small difference. It's so good in the red book, but the hotel front desk staff doesn't have a high level of professional knowledge. I personally don't think it's worth it. I just said casually, the minibar thing is really touching. No one drank the drinks that cost 10 yuan for a takeaway in Fujian. It's quite funny to make up the numbers in the minibar.

Facilities: Everything is available in the room, and the beds and pillows are first-class. Electric curtains, smart toilets, and lights are the highlights, and the lights can be turned on/off with one click.
Cleanliness: Very good. Cleaning is timely. The cleaning lady is very polite when meeting in the corridor and chats enthusiastically.
During the entire stay in the hotel, Fanny, the hotel housekeeper, provided very attentive service and asked questions, which was very good!
The only slight drawback is that the breakfast is a bit simple. For example, there is less Western-style ham and meat, and there are also fewer vegetables. Most of them are various carbohydrates.

It can be seen that the various indoor equipment are good, and the capsule coffee and toiletries provided are of high quality.

There seems to be a lot of breakfast varieties, but if you think about it carefully, there are actually not many choices. For out-of-town tourists who are not used to eating Sha Cha Noodles and don’t like sweets, there is not much to choose from. I had no choice but to ask the kitchen to make a bowl of clear soup noodles.

In terms of service, the uncle who took the initiative to open the door and carry the luggage was very nice. I don’t know his name. When he left, he made an appoin**ent with my child to meet me next year. The room attendant Liu Hongqiao (I don’t know if it means these three words) was also very nice. He gave me water. The bathing bag kept smiling and greeting me with concern. The front desk and reception are quite satisfactory.

This time it rained in Xiamen and the temperature dropped significantly. It felt very cold outside. But from the moment I arrived at the hotel, the several staff members I met made people feel warm. Their enthusiastic service was very warm and made you feel at home. The hotel is very close to the seaside and attractions, and the hotel facilities and room conditions are also good. Originally we only planned to stay for one day, but later we extended our stay for two more nights. Overall, it is a very satisfactory hotel. I will choose to stay there again when I come to Xiamen.

msg:Overall very satisfied
I stayed at Haiyue Villa for a few days and came here for another four days. I recommend everyone to stay here. The location is convenient to go everywhere. It is close to the Botanical Garden, Zhongshan Road, and Shapowei. It is very lively at night, and Zengcuo'an is right outside the door.

Facilities: Very new and complete. The gym facilities are good and open 24 hours a day! ! You can drink coffee and eat desserts downstairs. The desserts are delicious! ! The restaurant is a bit bland for Sichuan people.

Hygiene: The auntie is very active in cleaning and is very clean. I had allergies when I stayed at Haiyue before, and my legs were wrapped, but I no longer have allergies when I come here.

Service: Very good. Young people communicate easily and happily. It's nice to praise Xiaodu. I also prepared a small gift after leaving the store. 👍

Environment: Some small details in the room are quite good, such as the headrest in the bathtub, the loofah, the shower gel next to the bathtub, and the floor tiles under the bathtub also have floor heating. Smart toilets are also user-friendly.

I will come back next time. Although the sea view room does not have a sea view and is not very cost-effective, the identical double bed room is very cost-effective. Except that there is no sea view, everything else is the same and the price is much lower.

Breakfast includes local specialty ginger duck, peanut soup, and sand tea noodles. It's worth the price of admission.

This room type is quite good, with large floor-to-ceiling windows. On the 6th floor, you can see part of the sea view.
Breakfast is also rich.
Other services are still online.
Also, the bed was very comfortable, but I was in a hurry and forgot to ask about the mattress brand.

Breakfast: Both Chinese and Western buffet breakfast are available, the noodle cook is friendly
(At that time, I went to the restaurant to enjoy it just after 7 o'clock, but the soup for cooking noodles was not yet available.
(Open) After everything was ready, the little brother helped me serve it directly to the table!

Hygiene: This is the biggest highlight of this hotel. The management is very knowledgeable.
Fortunately, I hired Ms. Yang, the housekeeper "Yang Jiamei". This aunt's attitude
Friendly, tidying up the room seems to be done with as much care as tidying up one's own home.
Treating tenants like family members is highly commendable.
If I visit Xiamen next time, I will definitely stay at Hilton again.

I recently stayed at Xiamen Joyze Hotel, Curio Collection by Hilton. This trip was simply a quality trip and allowed me to encounter wonderful things. 🌞
The hotel is very conveniently located in the bustling area of ​​Xiamen, with very convenient transportation. Not only that, there are many attractions and food around the hotel for me to explore and enjoy during my trip. 🚗
As soon as I entered the hotel lobby, I was attracted by its design and elegant a**osphere. Tall floor-to-ceiling windows fill the entire space with natural light, giving it a bright and comfortable feel. 💒
The decoration in the room is equally exquisite and elegant, and every detail reflects quality and comfort. The bed is soft and comfortable, and the bedding is of high quality, allowing me to have a peaceful sleep every night. The bathroom was fully equipped and luxurious, allowing me to relax and unwind after a tiring trip. 🛏️
The hotel's food and beverage service is also excellent. The restaurant's elegant environment and diverse and delicious dishes left a deep impression on me whether it was for breakfast, lunch or dinner. The hotel also provides attentive room service, allowing me to enjoy delicious food without leaving the room. 🍴
The service attitude of the staff was also a highlight of my trip. They were warm and friendly, always had a smile on their face, and were quick to respond and help no matter what I needed. Their professionalism and attentive service made me feel warm and comfortable. 👍
To sum up, Xiamen Joyze Hotel, Curio Collection by Hilton provided me with an excellent experience of a quality trip. Whether it is the hotel's location, decoration design, catering service, or staff attitude, I am deeply satisfied and recommend it. I sincerely recommend this hotel to everyone, and I believe you will also have a wonderful experience here! 💖

msg:October is the best season in Xiamen! I came to Xiamen just because of this sentence. Indeed, the season is definitely the best in Xiamen, the temperature is good, and there are no typhoons yet. When choosing a hotel in Xiamen, this Hilton Curio Hotel becomes your first choice. The reasons for choosing - firstly, the location is good, next to Zengcuo'an, with mountains on the back and the sea, very close to Xiamen University and the seaside. Second, it is Hilton’s brand effect. After checking in, I really deserved it! Needless to say, the hardware facilities are great, especially the large floor-to-ceiling windows! No matter day or night, the joy of looking at the mountain scenery is indescribable. As for the service, the staff here are impeccable. Remember, someone once said that the best service is "exceeding expectations", and it is indeed true. In the evening, the service staff delivered the "Good Night Soup", along with a handwritten card (signed Chun Hong); a "fruit plate" was delivered unexpectedly (later I learned that it was specially arranged by "Zizi" at the front desk) Good), all greatly exceeded my "expectations", I feel really good! Hilton's service indeed "exceeds expectations"! Perhaps the satisfaction at the opening made my expectations too high. When I asked if I could "give another fruit plate during the stay", Duan Ran refused... 😊 Indeed, "the hotel's rules are not wrong."

The decoration of the hotel is also relatively high-end, and the room size is sufficient. Toto's smart toilet is very sensitive and has many modes. The large floor-to-ceiling windows are beautiful, but the floors are not high, so don’t expect too much from the view outside. There is also a 24-hour convenience store right outside the hotel, which is very convenient. It is absolutely no problem to get breakfast or something. Overall, I think it is worth recommending!
A reminder that has nothing to do with the hotel. There is a travel agency on the other side of the hotel building that offers sailing services for 198 per person. It is totally worth it. Don’t listen to the taxi driver! It’s no different from Ctrip 78 alone, it only takes half an hour at sea!

There is also a bus stop in front of the hotel. As soon as I entered the hotel lobby, I was attracted by the fragrance. It smells so good, it smells like lemongrass. The design concept of the room is simple, but classy. The overall feeling is very youthful.
There are a lot of people eating breakfast. On the first day, the dishes were empty, but on the second day, it improved. Noodle stalls need to get a sign and line up. My favorite is the small ingredients of the porridge stall, golden orchid bamboo shoots and crispy melon, which reminds me of the standard breakfast every day when I used to work in a ********* hotel.
The hotel room types should be the same, only the difference in floor height. On the first day, the 2nd floor was facing the street. When the room was renewed, the original room type was no longer available, so we upgraded to another room. After completing the formalities, the staff helped me move my luggage to the 5th floor, where you can see the sea.
I am very satisfied with this stay

msg:Environment: The decoration boards used are relatively cheap. The function of the lobby is only for resting. The decoration of the guest rooms is almost the same as that of the Hanting. The bathroom is separated from wet and dry. The layout is very unreasonable. The entire basin is placed outside the wardrobe. As for the corridor, it is extremely easy to get wet. There is a toilet room right at the door. The entire space is enough for one toilet, and there are no shelves, so there is no place to put your mobile phone. The room does not have a balcony.
Service: When checking in, the front desk was neither enthusiastic nor smiling. It was cold and there was no extra trea**ent for four days. Of course, this is not what it should be, but it is rare compared to other resort hotels. In addition, you have to go through the front desk when going upstairs from the lobby. You have to ask if you want to check in every time, which is quite speechless.
Facilities: There is no children's paradise, no indoor swimming pool, only a rectangular swimming pool with no other water play facilities except swimming. It is visually impossible for 20 people to swim. There is a simple gym.
Hygiene: The guest rooms have carpets on the wooden floors, so you can't get a close look, you know.
Landscape: No sea in sight. There are street scenes on all sides.
Location: Five minutes' walk to Calligraphy Square Beach.
Summary: The price/performance ratio is very poor. Indigo on Zhongshan Road or Haiyue in Huangcuo will be better at this price.

It’s too bad 😭 The sanitation is extremely poor, and the sound insulation is also extremely poor. The ceiling of the entire room is moldy and cracked. I immediately canceled it for the next two days. I booked a Hilton room the next day. I am very satisfied. From getting off the car to welcome guests, handling at the front desk, and room service all meet the standard of a star hotel. When I come back at night, there will be good night soup from the room depar**ent. It is delicious😋 too Heartwarming.

After I called the front desk in the evening when something happened two days ago, the duty manager Wu Juanjuan came to deal with it immediately. On the third day, I upgraded the parent-child room for free. In the morning, I arranged for someone to send my luggage to the parent-child room. After playing, take the key and enter the room directly. Afternoon tea was also provided. Although the afternoon tea is so-so, hahaha. Still thank her very much. When I left, I also gave gifts to the children. The concierge service is very good. They will open the door for you when you go in and out for a few days, open and close the door when you get in and out of the car, and carry your luggage. The pool kids’ swimming rings are 30 yuan per rent. When I went swimming the next day, I took the initiative to scan the QR code to pay, and said that I would still use the one from yesterday. As a result, the staff member said that he paid the fee yesterday, so he doesn't need to pay anymore today, and he immediately felt good about it. Next time I come to Xiamen, I will stay here again. A little suggestion: The bottle cap of the mineral water in the room is too difficult to open. It needs to be opened every time it is wrapped in paper. It needs to be improved.

It is recommended to go directly to check in. It is very troublesome to book the wrong room. It is best to go to the restaurant to place the order yourself instead of placing the order in the room.

I asked the front desk about the 0.21 yuan? Don’t you want to withdraw from me? ! The front desk person confidently said "no change"! Is Hilton going to generate revenue through reverse erasure? Despite my repeated requests, they paid me back 0.1 yuan and still didn’t pay me the 0.11 yuan they owed! He never said sorry to me from beginning to end. On the morning of the 30th, I asked the front desk how to get to the beach? There were no other guests at the front desk at that time. The front desk person in red uniform was only looking at the computer. After I asked, the front desk person was still looking at the computer. There was no response or expression during the whole process! The room facilities are also very strange. The toilet is so small that one person cannot close the door smoothly. He has to hide behind the door sideways to close the door. The faucet is even more frustrating. There is no obvious hot or cold indicator. The shower handle in the bathroom is designed in reverse, making it easy for cold water to spray down from the top. Breakfast is very ordinary, porridge, one day is thin like soup, the other day is thick like rice. High praise for the room aunt and the doorman, the service is attentive, enthusiastic and very competent. The person in charge of the front desk should carefully review and train them so that the hotel will not behave so disrespectfully towards customers.

As soon as we arrived at the hotel, the air conditioner in the room was already turned on. The weather in Xiamen is really hot, and the coolness is really comforting.
The room is very bright, the glass is wiped clean, and you can see the sea view. Although the room is not very big, it is very cozy. The bathroom uses a washlet, the shower has a strong flow, and the shower is very comfortable, which is really important for staying in a hotel. ￼
After checking in, all the staff I encountered were very thoughtful. Even the cleaning aunt in the corridor saw us and said happy birthday to the children, which was really heartwarming. ￼In the evening, the hotel provided fruit, and also gave the children a big fruit cake, which tasted pretty good. Before going to bed, the hotel delivered mung bean soup, so staying in this hotel, the service alone is already worth it. ￼￼
In addition to the amazing service, the location of the hotel is also very good. There are many restaurants downstairs, next to Zengcuo'an, and there is also a music beach. It is very convenient. This time the choice is absolutely correct.

The hygienic environment is very clean. We stayed for three nights. One day, we accidentally spilled water on the sheets, and the auntie immediately helped us put on clean sheets and quilt covers. Thank you for your hard work.
The hotel's infinity pool is also featured and very clean. Under the illumination of the lights at night, it has a different view.
  At the same time, the transportation around the hotel is also very convenient. A good service concept of the hotel starts from the moment you enter the door. All the depar**ents of Gree are very enthusiastic and meticulous. If you have the opportunity to visit in the future, you will choose Jiayi Hilton Hotel Rui, I also hope that the hotel will be maintained, and the business is getting better and better😀

On the first day, I left a note "Please put 4 bottles of water" on the table. After cleaning the room every day, there will be 4 bottles of water on the table, which moved me very much. By the way, the toilet and curtains are electric, which is convenient and hygienic. The most sensible choice for this trip to Xiamen.

The room type is very good, comfortable to live alone
The location is less than 100 meters away from the beach, and there is a summer coastal market nearby. The beach is quite big, and it is really convenient to watch the sea~
It's also very close to other beaches, and you can watch the sunset at night, which is pretty good

The hotel also thoughtfully sent mung beans and fruits for good night, and the front desk was also very nice

The only small flaw is that some parts of the hotel still have dead corners, such as the bathroom near the wall of the trash can, but the overall is still very clean.

The location of the hotel is very good, and it is very easy to go to any scenic spot. It's close, just cross a road from the beach, and only two or three hundred meters away from Zengcuo'an. But the most satisfying thing is the service of the hotel. Everyone is very enthusiastic and will greet you when you meet, especially Xiao Feng at the front desk , a very gentle young lady, since I checked in, she has taken good care of us. When the takeaway arrives, someone will deliver it to the room. If I have any questions, she will patiently answer them. This short journey made me feel Xiamen. Humanistic a**osphere, warm hospitality, looking forward to going again next time.

This short but happy time started with Xiamen Joyze Hilton. Clara Lin, the front desk manager, helped with introductions, arranged attractions, itineraries, and contacted chartered cars. Caixia, the customer service manager in the background, sent white fungus soup and mung bean soup every night. Knowing that I am not used to sleeping on high pillows in hotels, I specially sent low buckwheat husk pillows! Feeling so heartwarming, home away from home, feel very lucky, but what I want to say is: this is the standard of Joyze Hilton, you must be the luckier one below. sincere gratitude!

We stayed here for three nights, and it's very convenient to travel. The bus station (Xiamen Science and Technology Middle School) is downstairs. Taxis and online car-hailing are also very convenient, and there is Star Papa at the door, coffee heads like it very much. The catering in the hotel is also good, and the price/performance ratio is also very high. If you are tired from playing, it is a good choice to have a Chinese meal in the hotel (the ginger duck is delicious). Finally, I would like to mention our personal butler: Yuxin, who is very considerate in service and will give you a lot of warm tips. I told her that I need a quieter room, and she immediately arranged it.
Overall, it is really a hotel with a good service experience and relatively new facilities.

You in the room, follow the regulations, if you follow the regulations, why can you check out the room at 2 o'clock? I understand that it is normal to take the room at 3 o'clock, but can the attitude be better? Only Clara at the front desk is better. She took the initiative to introduce the nearby places that can be done. When you come back, you can go swimming in the room first. It’s not that the water in the constant temperature swimming pool is relatively cold. After you go back, you plan to start playing with the theme room facilities in the room. There are slides in the goods, but just take a look. The ladder system is rotten. It will be very dangerous for children to play. Inform the hotel immediately. The hotel doesn’t have one more slide, and we don’t want to change to other themed rooms with slides. It’s just a smaller basketball hoop. The children are very disappointed, so book a themed room I planned to compare the room with the children to play with the facilities, but I didn’t check it out because the last person checked out at 2 o’clock and wanted to catch up with the room, so I asked him to clean it and didn’t check it clearly? What should I do if the child is injured after playing, but no solution is provided after the accident? So it can be regarded as very disappointed with the 5-star hotel

The layout of the room is reasonable, except that the air conditioner was a bit hot on the first day, and after explaining the situation to the front desk, it seemed that it was not so hot the next day, and the problem was solved in a timely manner. The dining environment for breakfast is very good, so I also come here for dinner one day. The service and dishes of the restaurant are good, and the set meal is very cost-effective. Had a great two days here!

msg:The sanitation of the hotel is not bad, and the decoration is quite new. Although the subway is being built nearby, it may not have any impact because the construction was not started during the Spring Festival when I went there. It is about 100m away to walk to the Pearl Bay beach. It is quite convenient and has a bathtub. And two sets of bathrobes, the toilet is also smart, and the cleaning products used are also from the British brand Crabtree. The service is also very good. I didn’t feel impatient because of the crowd. I only stayed for one night. The price is too expensive during the Spring Festival. Crying, 2k is still not worth it, but the usual price of 700 to 800 should be said to be quite cost-effective. If you come to Xiamen next time, you can still choose this hotel~

The room was still very hot (25 degrees) when the temperature was adjusted to 16 degrees. I asked the staff to help I saw that the temperature was adjusted at the beginning and the temperature dropped, and it went up again after a while!!! The room was kept at 25 degrees all night~
Service: All the staff are very good, the two staff in the special restaurant, one (Jiang Yanqi) is very polite and lovely and led us to a comfortable location, the other sister’s name is unknown, should she be a minister or a manager?! The costumes are different from others, and the person is very nice and introduced the local sugar water in detail, and even served us a bowl for each of us! The service must be praised!!!
Facilities: It would be better if the hotel has a robot, which can help deliver takeaway or other supplies. I didn’t want to go out to eat because I was too late and too tired, but I still had to go downstairs to get it by myself. This problem should have other problems The guests have thought about it, the hotel can think about it!

I couldn’t figure out the room card. I asked the same front desk to help me arrange for the cleaning lady to clean up. When I went back to the room at night, I didn’t help me arrange a mess. I left a message. After the room left the hotel, the manager of the hotel contacted me quickly to express my apology. After all, it is Hilton Light The rooms are generally luxurious and the size is moderate. The fly in the oin**ent is that the TV is not very clear and cannot be projected. The bathroom is the first thing I like in every hotel or homestay. I am very satisfied.

Hilton's room type is very good, with large floor-to-ceiling windows, the scenery outside the window is very pleasant, and the sanitary conditions are good.
I ate two meals at the Hilton restaurant on the last day, and the cod set meal for two at noon was great!
We were in a hurry for dinner, so we chose to continue dining at the hotel. The restaurant manager helped us replace the set meal for two that will be launched soon. The fried rice was delicious and very satisfying.
A little suggestion is: the set meal is very large, and it will still be a little bit too much for two people.

2. The room layout is too cramped. There is no room for the sink, so why put a bathtub? It's hard to put a toilet in the toilet and open the door, but you still have the nerve to pay 900 for one night without bringing breakfast?
3. The hotel service staff are like wood. They stutter for a long time and will not open the door or take the luggage when they arrive at the door. I went to the swimming pool and couldn't swipe my card to get in. After waiting for fifteen minutes, I found the cleaning aunt before she got the call and opened the door for us. Later, other xhs netizens humorously expressed their check-in experience as "the service staff likes to pay attention"
4. The floor is too low, the price is too high, and the facilities are too poor. It is not as good as All Seasons. The welcome fruits are rotten oranges and apples. Very stale! Two bottles of mineral water in the mini bar.
5. The sofa is dirty and the cheap fabric is worse than IKEA and All Seasons.
6. Toiletries are so-so. The plastic comb and toothbrush are of the same quality as in a three-star hotel.
Will not be returning.
Although the hotel is close to the sea, you can't see the *** at all next to the sea... haha.

[Food and Beverage] The buffet breakfast in the hotel seems to have a lot of varieties, but the quality and taste need to be improved (it is really not delicious). It is better to book a room without breakfast. There is a Starbucks downstairs.
【Swimming pool】very bad! ! ! The hotel has only been opened for 2-3 years. The swimming pool has no maintenance work. The small bricks on the ground fall off, and the feet will be scratched if you are not careful.

msg:A hotel that you can rest assured in Xiamen is not much better than hotels with more than 2,000 in this time period. From the design to the check-in experience, it is really good. The cleaned room will have a sign, and there is no need to insert the card, toilet and shower after entering the room. The rain is completely separated, the toilet is smart, and there is no need to manually flip the lid. The bedding is also very good. The mattress is soft but supportive, and there will be no back pain after sleeping. Although the floor is not high, I personally feel very friendly. I have trouble falling asleep when I go out, but I don’t have it here at all: it has a night light mode, and there is a psychological transition before going to sleep, and there is no unfamiliar environment after I switch to sleep mode. I like it very much.
Although it is not by the sea, it is not far from the sea. It is just a walk after dinner. It is very quiet and praised.
Disadvantages: The price will temporarily increase during the peak season. I originally wanted to book another night the next day, and then it went directly to 1000➕, so I had to change to another one set by the company... Sad (blame me for being poor)
Real reviews from first-time guests, this hotel has an underrated internet rating.
Of course, there are still some small flaws: if the water outlet of the shower room is damaged, it is recommended to repair it in time. If there are children staying there, there are still potential safety hazards. Second, there is a white bathrobe with medium-length hair, indicating that the bathrobe has not been checked and replaced. In terms of price, it still needs to be matched.
Because I have a high favorable impression of this hotel, small flaws are actually not that important, but I hope the hotel can pay attention to these small problems and give more customers a better experience.

msg:Forgot to take the other photos, but this Hilton location is so nice. It takes five minutes to walk to the beach. Go out the gate and turn left for five minutes to Zengcuo'an. There are seafood stalls near Zengcuo'an, and there are also fine dishes, which is very convenient to eat. It takes ten minutes by taxi to the Botanical Garden, and about 20 minutes to the Xiagu Wharf.
The hotel is very professional and attentive from the welcome to the front desk, and the cleaning aunt is very enthusiastic.
The room facilities are relatively new, with a sense of design, the intelligent switch is convenient and easy to use, and the curtains and window screens are beautiful and practical. The mattress is moderately firm and comfortable. The wet and dry separation of the bathroom is very good. The only downside: the bathroom of the basic room has an odor, it seems that there is no ventilation, and the door can only be closed immediately after use. No way, this is a flaw in the hardware design. Maybe other higher-level room types do not have this problem. Next time I have the opportunity, I want to experience this balcony room.
The breakfast taste is ok, the variety is also rich, and there are all the things that should be there, without any fault.
Next time I come to Xiamen, I will choose this Hilton.

msg:The price is relatively expensive, but the service is really not good. Because the flight time was late, we left things out for a walk. Everything was fine. Unfortunately, we finally went back to the hotel to pick up our luggage and rest in the lobby. The waiter asked us to take away the garbage Let's go, there's actually no garbage, just a mineral water bottle and a new mask. The problem is that there is no trash can in the lobby. I asked the waiter to take it away. The taxi came and waited outside. My daughter took it away with a good temper. Fire, but bear with it, I thought that one more thing is worse than one less thing, there will always be a trash can outside the hotel door, but I still can't find it, the taxi is waiting, my daughter is looking everywhere, I took it and threw it directly in the open space in front of the hotel. , too much, bad review! And the legs I was stung after staying one night were all red spots. Maybe I was too tired during the day, I slept too deeply, I didn't feel it, and I found it was itchy during the day, but there was no evidence to prove what was going on. Anyway, it sucks!

msg:Personally, I think it is one of the best hotels in Xiamen. Although it is close to Zengcuo'an, it has good privacy, allowing guests to enjoy Zengcuo'an food while avoiding the noise of the scenic area. If you want to go to the beach, you can go out and walk across the Huandao Road to Huangcuo Beach. You can often see some windsurfers training at the beach.
The hotel has not been open for a long time, and all the facilities are brand new. The lobby and rooms are designed in a simple and modern style, fully reflecting the characteristics of Hilton Curio, a resort brand. In particular, there is a Starbucks on the first floor of the hotel, which is definitely a blessing for coffee lovers. Although the infinity swimming pool on the third floor of the hotel is not large in size, it is also a good place to cool off from the summer heat by lying beside the pool and watching the night view.
The service of the staff also reflects the consistent standard of Hilton, which is civilized and polite without losing enthusiasm, and all guests are very satisfied.
I will definitely stay here next time I come to Xiamen!

I was so sick that I didn’t take pictures. I don’t like the smell of aromatherapy. Others are ok. The toilet is ok. It's a little inconvenient, the faucet is on the side and I feel a little low, the disposable items are up to the standard, the room cleaning service is OK, the lighting control is up to the standard, the writing desk is not good, I put a computer, and I can't put it down if I put a little takeaway, just one Small round table, and then it is a bit troublesome to go downstairs to the gate for takeout, but it is acceptable. I have never been to the swimming pool gym. The breakfast type is ok. It's ok, the bacon is slightly salty and the rest are similar, the dining environment is average, the lighting is dim, the front desk staff seems to be unskilled, but it's okay, I didn't wait for a long time, but I feel that it's not a good thing to upgrade, anyway, I don't want it I lost my own sea view. The location of the hotel is average. If you say that it is close to the sea, it is true that you can reach the beach after a few walks. If you are walking around, you can consider this one. You don’t need to go to Baicheng Beach. It is also convenient to go to Zengcuochao to watch the sunrise. It takes about ten minutes to take a taxi.
Overall evaluation, the five-star hotel should meet the standard, the hygiene can be refined a little bit, and the takeaway function is being optimized

A man at the front desk was arrogant. When he asked about the view of the room, he said: I live by myself and think the XXXX view is the best. Personally, I think we should listen to customer needs first. It is really unprofessional to express that I have also stayed in a hotel. 2. The details of sanitary dead corners are not well done. 3. Two service staff came into the room to help and stepped on the carpet with the shoes outside, and put the mobile phone directly on my bed. Hope to spend more time on employee recrui**ent and training.

msg:The overall experience is not very good. It is recommended not to come on anniversary or birthday. The attitude of the guy at the front desk is quite good, but other places make me feel that I am on vacation at all. 1. When I went to the gym, there was only one fitness instructor on duty. I planned to go to the gym and the swimming pool before going back to the room to change clothes. The elder brother didn’t say hello when he saw me coming in, but looked suspiciously. Ask me: what are you here for? I was very embarrassed to say that I first came down to see the facilities. It was raining in Xiamen a few days ago, and I asked if the water in the swimming pool was changed every day. I also received surprised eyes. The resort hotel is really short of people. Let the elder brother of the life jacket act as a service staff, and it is a blunt sentence to be stopped directly after changing the swimsuit: no swimming cap is not allowed to enter, and I did not go to the front desk to buy a 30 yuan one... There are basically no polite words, and I want to swim. The whole process seems to have done something wrong. I just came to Xiamen to celebrate my birthday. I didn't receive any blessings on my birthday, not even a card. This is the first time that I have stayed in so many hotels. If you pay attention to the sense of ceremony, don't choose this one. I felt sick in the morning and wanted to drink a cup of hot milk and asked my boyfriend to ask the customer service or the front desk for a cup. I was told that I had to buy it. In the end, the lady at the front desk may have seen that it happened to be the guest’s birthday and asked the guest room to send a cup, and the guest room came in with this sentence. There was a charge for a cup, but because of your birthday, our hotel gave you a free glass of milk... I am quite speechless. All the hotels I have stayed at at this price at least have good night hot milk. A cup of hot milk is really good. Not so. experience as above

msg:The resort hotel is located at the junction of the scenic spot and the seaside. It's not very convenient, and takeout has certain limitations. I booked a balcony twin room. There are only two balcony rooms in the hotel, and they are separated by plants. Personally, I feel that the privacy is relatively poor. If you don't pull the curtains, you can see the indoor room next door. The balcony is quite large, and there is also a set of tables and chairs, which is very suitable for parties and meals. I like it very much. The room is not big and the decoration is OK. I personally think that the biggest highlight of the room is that the bathroom is separated into three parts. The bathtub, shower, and toilet are all separate spaces, which feel more convenient and clean. The point of the facilities and equipment is that the curtains are automatic, and the design of the lights is also good, which is very convenient. The disadvantage is that the bathtub does not provide a disposable bath bag. Although the bathtub is hygienic, it still feels better. There is an indoor drawer refrigerator, which is good. There is a capsule coffee machine, but the coffee is bad. The design of the hotel is still beautiful, not the kind of gorgeous and luxurious, but the elegant holiday style. The service is also very good. Overall, I think the price/performance ratio is good, and it is a pleasant stay experience.

msg:It combines the service quality of a world-class hotel chain + the unique design sense of an independent hotel.
Advantages: unique room design, exquisite details, such as open bathroom + sink. Other useful hardware facilities: smart toilet cover, total lighting control of the whole house, electric curtains, etc. The staff is very friendly and enthusiastic, and the service is meticulous. Late check-out is easy and convenient. There are many types of breakfast on the first floor, and the restaurant has an exquisite and warm design. The three-cup chicken and low-temperature slow-cooked ribs for lunch were very good. The price is acceptable. There is a Starbucks on the first floor.
Disadvantages: The design of the sink is a bit flawed. The left end is extended for beauty, but the faucet on the right is not long enough, that is, the left side is completely wasted when washing hands, and the water on the right will splash out of the sink.
The location of the bathtub is a bit awkward. Although it is an open bathroom, it is not possible to watch TV while taking a bath. The window of the room on one side is facing the dormitory of the middle school next door, so there is some privacy concerns if you don’t pull the gauze curtains. The location of the safe is a bit hidden and difficult to find. It is recommended to add a hint.

The room type is very open, ventilated, and sanitary without dead ends. What is remarkable is that the bathroom facilities are very advanced. The suite is equipped with double toilets, double sinks, and separate dry and wet. Friends who are particular about hygiene can rest assured.
I have the habit of alcohol disinfection when I stay in the hotel. I wiped it and found that there was no dust, and I felt quite at ease.
I clean up the room twice a day in the morning and afternoon, and every time I come back, it is very clean, and the gauze curtains will be put down intimately to make the room less hot. There is a good night sweet soup and handwritten card every day.
The small details are well done. I brought a lot of skin care products on the sink, blocking the small drawer containing hotel toiletries. In fact, I only need to add a shower cap the next day, thinking that the waiter will not remove me. I went to check the items, and when I came back, I helped me replenish the only shower cap that I consumed, and put my items back in their original place, and I was serving them with heart.
The hotel is near Zengcuo'an, within walking distance, quiet and convenient transportation. Very recommended, cost-effective, great service

The hotel on Huandao Road has lived all the way south from the International Conference Center, Victoria, and Haiyue Villa. This time I chose Jiayi Hilton, which proved to be a good choice.
 The hotel is located a little bit west of Zengcuo’an. It takes five minutes to walk east to Zengcuo’an, and it takes two to three minutes to walk south to the beach. It takes a taxi to Zhongshan Road 20 blocks, so the location of the hotel is very good; In addition to upgrading to a suite this time, the child is over 1.2m, and breakfast is also included; good night soup is delivered to the room every night, which is very considerate; the hotel also has an infinity pool, due to time constraints, I only experienced it once for less than half an hour. ; I gave a late check-out on the day of check-out.
Generally speaking, as a luxury hotel, all the points are taken up, it is very recommended to stay, next time I will choose and recommend to relatives and friends

早餐感覺沒吃到什麼東西，不知道是不是地方口味的差異，麪包甜食很多，中餐很少，海鮮沙茶麪不錯，就個人口味而言比我在外面吃的好吃。
退房的時候是除夕，前台全程也沒聽到一句新年快樂！出門的時候還是迎賓説了一堆新年祝福之類的。真的要好好誇一誇迎賓的同學。

不足：房間面積不太大；洗手枱位於進門後的過道中間，個人感覺佈局不太合理；洗手枱的枱盤很大，但是水龍頭距離台盆距離很短，洗手很容易把枱麪澆濕；給的房間靠近馬路，因為樓層不高，如果窗簾拉開基本上就沒有私隱可言。
總體來説還算不錯，但房間細節還可以有提升的空間。

總體來説比較推薦，年底還會回來，希望能有所改變。

辦理入住有點慢，需要等待，可能是因為人手不夠吧，但是在此特別感謝前廳辦理入住的小姐姐penny，感謝你的貼心服務，讓我好感倍增!還有主動幫忙搬運行李的小姐姐小哥哥
酒店大堂的檸檬草香氛特別治癒，我超級愛這個味道
樓下有星巴克和便利店，太方便了，不得不愛。早餐網上評價不好，但是我個人覺得很好，品種很豐富，中西結合，牛腩麪牛腩給的很足，根本吃不完，我很滿意，出品對得起價格。
房間設施稍顯陳舊，有些設施需要維護保養了，衞生打掃可以再細緻些。很貼心的送了晚安湯，雖然我沒有喝，但是感覺很貼心，還給了泡泡浴和潤膚露，真的很感謝你的貼心服務!
下次來廈門還是會選擇佳逸，希望下次我有機會體驗露天泳池，感謝你們的熱情服務，讓我的廈門之行更加舒服愉快

酒店的整體環境不錯，早餐也比較豐富，前台的服務很好，提出的要求都幫我們解決了，在此表示感謝！
先揚後抑（´･Д･）」房間裏能聽到樓道里的聲音，一大早旅行團退宿的時候會比較吵，特別是小孩子的聲音。第二天比較安靜。
總體來説還是很不錯👍

房間衞生做的特別好，阿姨們都很有禮貌，出入都會打招呼。

酒店位置也不錯，去哪裡都方便，出門就是沙灘。

總的來説是一次比較愉快的入住。

衹是希望前台幾位工作人員專業度更上一層樓。就很完美了。

1.除了大廳前台，所有碰到的服務人員都主動打招呼了。跟保潔阿姨要了兩瓶水，後面直接就給放4瓶了，贊。
2.房間不小，乾淨整潔，空間佈局也不錯，很新；
3.泳池水質還可以，水温不錯。救生員和門口帥哥都能主動聊幾句；
4.位置不錯，距離沙灘很近，一樓有便利店。

缺點：1.入住辦理有點慢，前台抱怨電腦不好用。
2.房間窗子是封死的，所以一進屋能感覺到一點潮的味道，不通風。馬桶屋子沒有排風扇，大號那個味道散不出去呀！不明白為何把窗子封掉。
3.多人吐槽的水龍頭確實設計有問題。
4.附近在修地鐵，房間內不吵，但去中山路不方便，天天堵車。夜間回來也不好打車。地鐵通了這個位置就無敵了。
5.一次性牙具有點差，刷牙掉毛。

酒店早餐還可以，麪線糊好吃。

酒店最大的問題是前台人員素質較低，特別一位劉*雲Catherine,智商情商雙低，説話方式與內容讓人不僅不舒服且感覺受到嚴重冒犯，感覺缺乏基本的素質培訓，與五星級酒店的檔次完全不符。後面有一位客服經理還可以，算是部分解決了不滿。

附近的曾厝安就是破舊街道狹窄的大排檔，根本不值得逛，因此一千多一晚的房價不值得，建議選擇其他酒店。

比較抱歉的是忘記拍室內照片了，但是選擇希爾頓不會出錯。
選擇這家希爾頓酒店是因為離黃厝沙灘🏖️較近 附近周邊就是炮台遺址 中山街 南普陀寺也都非常近。這裏值得一提的是前台美女小姐姐們真的非常好👍 還分享了廈門旅遊攻略 當天就果斷又續住了一晚
廈門是一個適合休閑旅遊的城市，悠閑愜意地慢慢享受。最不值得去的就是鼓浪嶼，商業化嚴重，不想再去第二次了。最不可信的是隨手攔下的出租車司機師傅的話。最要防範的是帆船⛵️輪渡代票公司，一個比一個坑！！！

入住前，Clara 雨欣提前電話聯繫加了微信，幫我們預留好房間要求，還發了行程攻略，熱情好客，入住期間也是時時詢問有無需要，還給我家兒子安排機器人送水滿足好奇心，謝謝美女姐姐。
房間很乾凈，潔癖星人滿意，入住期間工作人員都會熱情打招呼，每天晚上都有桂圓紅棗湯。
智能馬桶，電動窗簾，都很加分。

msg:這次是第二次入住了，整體很不錯，第一次入住的時候因為我等他們打掃房間等了兩個多小時才辦理了入住，這次入住我就提前打電話到前台告知了我房間的需求希望不要再等很長時間了，等我到酒店的時候這次辦入住就順利了很多，這裏特別感謝前台林曉燕，態度非常好，很喜歡跟她溝通交流，她聽到我説上次讓我等了好長時間，給我升級了房間，但是她沒跟我説，我是去到房間才發現的，這種默默無聞卻用實際行動來告訴你在為客人着想的態度很值得表揚，入住期間也經常麻煩林曉艷和他們同事幫我處理各種事情，真的很感謝他們。這家店的位置服務，房間的設計都很值得推薦，這也是我為啥第一次等了那麼長時間辦入住這次還選擇繼續住他們家的原因，不過提個小小的建議，賓客服務中心的一部分工作人員態度有一點高傲，希望加強培訓和管理，客人經常接觸的就是前台和賓客服務中心的人，是一個酒店的臉面，所以我覺得應該重視

酒店南門右拐門口有便利店，公交站，沿着公交站左手邊，即龍虎山路一直往南走10分鐘不到就是環島南路了，可以往西去廈大，世茂、鼓浪嶼；也可以往東去曾厝安小吃街、山海健康步道，打的，公交都方便。

msg:不得不説這是我住過最差的希爾頓，住了兩晚房間有巨大的蜘蛛網到第二天打掃還是沒有清潔。第二點，服務非常敷衍！我們帶有孩子需要被子打過電話以後半小時未送達，我又打了一個對方説稍等馬上送！接着我又等了半小時，後面再打電話已經是無人接聽，我打了五個都沒人接。第二天我將這些情況反應給前台經理，才去打掃掉蜘蛛網！才給我拿了被子！又給我送了孩子的禮物。第三點住店期間樓下施工晚上10點機器還在運作，很吵！酒店到底什麼原因造成這樣的住店體驗我不清楚，總之非常失望！不會再選擇希爾頓！

1️⃣：位置位於曾厝垵景點、海邊🌊附近,晚上可以去海邊散步（步行4-5分鐘就可以到達）
2️⃣服務方面：剛到達酒店~ 就會有小哥幫忙開門,拿行李,這一點真的很加分！ 每天出入房間都會有工作人員打招呼,特別感謝負責接待的雨欣小姐姐~交流中特別真誠且熱情，從入住到離店都很負責，幫助我們很多,服務很在線👍 衞生方便也很棒
3️⃣居住方面：特別喜歡他們家床~很軟,電視也很大~ 3樓還有健身房和無邊泳池 ,無邊泳池建議傍晚6點左右再去 很適合拍照,健身房是全天的,樓下還有餐廳和星巴克🎶適合在酒店躺平 哈哈哈哈

下面重點講講服務 還沒入住前就有人和我主動聯繫了 這種服務以前基本發生在民宿 就這點發現現在五星級酒店也開始特別注重服務了 非常好
在這裏 非常感謝雨欣 她一直在問我有什麼需求 主動幫我免費升級房型 幫我備註了提前入住 讓我在2點前就辦好了入住 準備好了晚上的甜湯和水果 還發了一些攻略給我參考 我因為當晚回酒店已是凌晨1點多了 有點累 和她提了一下是不是可以幫我安排一下早餐 她非常爽快地答應並迅速處理 畢竟已經是凌晨快2點了 有點抱歉打擾到她了 所以下次來廈門還是會選擇這裏

我：“我沒有説過要加早餐，也沒有進去吃。
大堂經理：“有可能是你的同住人説了加早餐。”
         到這裏我已經不想在這件事上跟她辯駁了，一直不相信我説的話，她沒有驗證過事情就一直推脱是住客的問題。還説這是很普遍的問題，（就想在這問一問攜程，你們比較專業，這類型問題在星級酒店真的很普遍？）我真的大大的問號❓還説住客多了容易搞錯。我都不好意思拆穿她了……5月5-5月7入住，假期剛過，酒店都沒啥人。到最後説現在查不到，到時查了真的沒吃過就會退，現在退不了。從頭到尾都是推拖詞語，沒有半點不好意思
         面對面溝通都是這樣，想像不到，如果是回家後才發現的，衹能打電話過去溝通，又要多少時間了，別説假期回來後工作是最多最忙了

msg:雖然不是什麼頂級酒店 但是希爾頓旗下 總體來説還是不錯的 特別要説下床墊 真的是舒服 以前出去玩從沒覺得酒店的床墊比家裡舒服 這還是第一次 回到家還會想念酒店的床 自助早餐很一般 品種不是很豐富 吃飽沒問題 酒店工作人員服務還是很熱情的 第一晚房間遇到些問題 免費給升級了海景房 回來後第一天接到酒店打來的電話 説房間出現小小損壞 詢問了一些問題 後來調查清楚 再次致電道歉什麼的 態度都非常nice 是一家很負責任的酒店

衞生：衞生就一般般，床品還是很乾凈，浴室和浴缸也很乾凈，就是燈具是那種容易積灰的，會有灰塵。

服務：重點是服務！！！服務真的很棒！！前台雨欣bb從入住開始就一直在幫我們做旅遊攻略，因為我們是很臨時出來旅遊的，也沒怎麼看攻略，每天去哪裡玩跟雨欣説一聲就立馬有答案了，好吃的好玩的瞭如指掌～
客房服務的彩霞阿姨也是很好哦，每天都有煮不同的糖水放在保温瓶裏，出去玩了一天很累回來看到真的超級暖心～～

門崗的保安都不錯，晚上到給開的出租車門，拎行李。奇怪的是門僮，第二天下午看到我抱着睡着的娃到門口沒手空着，也不幫開下大門

msg:酒店在曾厝垵，過馬路就是大海，所以沒事兒想去海邊溜達的，訂這裏很好。房間乾淨整潔，夠大，馬桶洗漱淋雨浴缸做到了全部分離，互不干涉。但有一個小小的問題就是，洗手枱的水龍頭嘴，離水盆太近了，基本就是貼着邊在洗手，水很容易就濺出去了。

早餐也還行，類型豐富，口味也OK，但就是個別的菜品太涼了，比如粥啥的。

整體的體驗還是不錯的，因為是新酒店，設施啊環境啊什麼的都挺好，酒店一層還有星巴克，方便的。

msg:這個酒店我還沒離店就忍不住想吐槽。首先入住當天歡迎水果，我定了兩間房，一間有，另一間沒有。就打前台讓他們補一份，前台開啟質問模式：當時入住時候，是承諾您的嗎？不好意思，那我查一下。那我和前台餐廳説一下吧。不過現在餐廳下班了，可能沒辦法補。 我當時在電話就覺得有點不開心，我不差你們這一份水果！是你們工作服務疏忽，然而一點抱歉的意思都沒有反而質問我！第二個就是，每天都不放棉簽和拖鞋在房間！洗髮護髮沐浴三件套，牙刷牙膏還有浴巾毛巾我都是自己帶的。就連棉簽都還能每天都疏忽了！每天打電話到前台！真的很煩，這家酒店服務意識很差！硬件還可以！

msg:非常荒唐花了1000多住了該酒店還賠了個iPad…
到家發現遺漏ipad在酒店，立馬聯繫酒店，多次交涉告訴我沒找到。
首先我為什麼那麼肯定是遺失在酒店房內：
理由一：最後一次使用是退房前一晚，我從未把iPad帶出門，不存在住酒店期間在外遺失的可能性。
理由二：退房後，我直接從酒店去高鐵回家，我隨身攜帶一個登機箱、一個小包、一個酒店紙袋。小包裝不進iPad，紙袋我特意用來裝外賣的，我衹可能把iPad放進登機箱。回家後想起沒印象把iPad裝起來，查看行李箱確實沒有。因此不存在是我離店後路上遺失的。
理由三：我的ipad雖然比較小，但還是有重量的，也很顯眼的，房間書桌的垃圾桶還分隔層，不存在我把它當垃圾扔了的可能性，我相信這個體積的物品也不存在清潔阿姨把它當垃圾處理的可能性。
理由四：我一個人入住的，期間也沒有別人進過房內，不存在被同行人拿走的可能性。
以上理由，我衹能懷疑它要麼是遺漏在房間的某個角落，要麼是被酒店內部人拿了。酒店負責人跟我電話交涉，多次都是説他們找了很多遍，監控也看了很多遍，否決了我説的兩個可能性。我不去下定論就是這兩個的哪個可能，但我能肯定的是ipad確實是在酒店房內遺失的。
我無法確認酒店方説辭的真實性，因為一直也衹是電話聯繫，我説想看監控，酒店説無法提供，我也不知道酒店方如何通過走廊的監控，那麼肯定的跟我説不可能是我所説的第二個可能性。
我確實無法提供實質性證據，因為我iPad沒電且沒開定位，無法找到位置。我也覺得沒有必要為了個ipad去浪費警力，但事實就是事實，我百分之百確定ipad是在房間遺失的，至於到底是酒店有沒有像他們説的那樣幫我盡力找，還是酒店的工作人員手腳不乾淨，無論是哪個理由都太糟心了，都覺得太離譜了，希爾頓這麼大的集團居然能發生這種事情。
請大家謹慎選擇，如果選擇了，也好好保護自己的財物！
