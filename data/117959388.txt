msg:It has a good location and a peaceful environment. The interior is very detailed and classy with a panoramic view of the dining hall and gym. It was super clean and organized. I think because it was quite new, too. I super enjoyed the breakfast, they offer a lot of good and healthy options. They gym was super nice which I really enjoyed the most. The swimming pool wasn’t yet open but I sneaked in and saw it was also amazing. I can’t wait to book again and enjoy their pool. I also enjoyed their bathtub which made my stay quite relaxing. I just had a problem with the pillow. It was too high, I didn’t use it and made my sleep uncomfortable. The hotel said they will replace it for the guests to have a better stay. Definitely recommend this hotel, cheap and worth it. They also gave me free soft drinks and toiletries.

Not only are the decoration style and facilities of the room very new, the room is very clean, and the facilities are also complete. There is a high-altitude swimming pool, gym and breakfast restaurant on the top floor, and the scenery is very good. There is also a quiet rest area on the second floor, which is very friendly for people like me who may travel frequently. You can rest and relax there while working. If you are tired, you can rest in the massage chair, which is also very comfortable. I have to mention that all the employees here are very friendly. Amy at the front desk will recognize me and greet me every time I come back. The overall stay experience is quite good.

msg:I wanted to give feedback to the apar**ent by email, but I couldn't find the mailbox, so I could only comment after my stay. First of all, my overall accommodation experience was far below my expectations, and it can even be said to be very bad.
Starting from the front desk service, I felt the hospitality that was inconsistent with your hotel brand. As a well-known apar**ent brand, I originally expected thoughtful and meticulous service, but unfortunately, the front desk service I encountered did not meet such standards. This made me very disappointed, because I think the front desk service is the first impression left by the hotel to the guests, and it is also an important window to reflect the overall service quality of the hotel.
Secondly, I was extremely dissatisfied with the room I stayed in. The room area is very small, which made me feel very cramped and depressed. Compared with the Ascott apar**ents I stayed in before, the rooms here are simply incomparable. Whether in terms of comfort, spaciousness or facility configuration, this place seems far inferior. Even compared with the old Fraser Place in Chengdu, the newly opened one is much inferior.
As a business person who travels frequently, I have certain requirements for the accommodation environment. However, this time I was greatly disappointed by my stay in your hotel. I hope your hotel will pay attention to guest feedback and improve service quality and accommodation environment to ensure that future guests can get better service and experience.
I would like to express my dissatisfaction and disappoin**ent with this stay again and look forward to your hotel improving as soon as possible.
Thank you.

msg:The main reason for booking this hotel was that it had an indoor swimming pool and sauna, but I found out after arriving that they were not public. . . Then you should write down on the Ctrip platform how you feel about being cheated. The room was okay, quite big. The service was warm and the room was upgraded.
