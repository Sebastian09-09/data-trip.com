msg:It was a pleasant surprise! The hotel is located on the top of the mountain. It is a courtyard-style design. There is a wonderful courtyard outside the room, with trees, rockery, flowers, and running water. The environment is so beautiful! Standing on the balcony, you can also overlook the city of Zhuji. Both the near and far views are superb! There is also an art gallery on the first floor. You can enjoy the paintings of painters for free when staying in the hotel. It is worthy of being an art hotel! The room is also spacious and very comfortable. The breakfast of the hotel is rich, exquisite and delicious. It is really worth the money to stay in the hotel. I hope to stay again next time.

Every detail is exquisite, the sky is round and the earth is square, the eight arrows and eight hearts, the gorgeous sunset, the beautiful reflections, and the restaurant is also very beautiful. Every sunny period is colorful and you can take a big picture. I like their tableware and tea sets very much. The cups and trash cans in the room are full of artistic sense. I won’t break down the service here, because every employee, whether it is the front desk or the guest room, including the engineering depar**ent, is very polite and enthusiastic, responsible, and clean. The hardware facilities in the room are good. The bath water can be improved for a better experience. The key point is that the art gallery on the first floor is really good, worth seeing and worth recommending.

You can only eat in the garden restaurant in the hotel, which costs 200 yuan per person. There is no choice of dishes. You can only eat what they have. The breakfast is also relatively simple. It is really unworthy of the 1500 yuan room! It can't be compared with star hotels. It's generally average. I don't recommend it! I won't go there again...

The hotel has a strong artistic a**osphere, and every aspect is full of design. There is a pond of koi in the lobby, which is particularly large. It looks like it weighs 100 kilograms. The hotel's breakfast is noodles. It should be Ciwu noodles, and the taste is great~ You can refill them wirelessly, and there are coffee, juice, milk, and yogurt. There was an unpleasant episode in the room at the beginning~ There was no hot water in the room... Both rooms were, and I had no choice but to change the room. The facilities in the room are not bad, but the bathtub, which did not achieve a good dry and wet separation, and the shower head was easy to splash outside~ The bed was very comfortable and quiet, especially suitable for relaxation. As for the swimming pool, it was a bit dirty... This is not very happy. The hotel facilities are quite complete, and the price of meals is relatively high. However, the hotel's appearance... It is really high, and it is a good view to take a casual shot. The hotel is located halfway up the mountain~ The front desk on the last day had a very good service attitude. I will choose this one next time.

When I got out of bed, I thought it was hard when I lay on it, but it was actually very comfortable to sleep on. Talk about improvements. The shower is too high, 160 little guy tiptoe to take it down, the water is too small, maybe because of the mountain, the parking lot should install a sunscreen, it is too hot in the car after being exposed to the sun in summer, the elevator to the first floor from the parking lot is sweltering. Others are very satisfied, suitable for couples to check in. Family outing, very satisfying trip.

 酒店整體裝修風格就是很江南園林的幾棟徽派建築，落地面積比較大，裏面的園藝造景做的超棒，可以説是一步一景了，早前跟酒店前台通過電話，預訂了過去的時間，前台都很熱情。前台邊上有一個大天井，裏面養了好多條很大的錦鯉，小朋友看到都激動壞啦，哈哈哈哈😂房間打掃的很乾凈，還有畫冊，入住水果，裝修也比較清爽，還可以泡澡。邊上環境很好，酒店內部有美術館，瞭解到基本都是國內早期油畫名家的作品，還有專人講解，太有藝術氛圍了！外面有挺大一塊草坪，還有一個露天泳池。
       起床溜達去吃了個酒店自帶的早餐，味道還不錯👍下午去市裡逛了逛，傍晚回酒店吃晚飯，那天天氣很好，山上風景很nice，看到了夕陽餘暉。總體來説這家酒店還是很推薦的，不管是服務還是裝修，衞生，環境方面都是拿得出手的，地方很大，也可以搞團建活動。
唯一遺憾的就是感覺缺少了體育運動場所和打發時間的項目，問了酒店前台，説在後期開發的項目裏面，還是值得期待的，以後有機會還會帶家人來度假。

msg:有幸是第一位入住的客人，因為剛剛開業，也比較忐忑，但是入住後才發現，無論是服務還是還是環境都達到了預期。自己平時入住了許多五星級酒店，每個都有自己的特色，這家酒店處處都充滿了藝術的氣息，在半山腰上，空氣好，早上起來陽光照射在房間裏，讓人覺得特別温馨舒服放鬆。酒店就在高速路口，自駕會很方便，離諸暨市區也不遠。主要是服務態度特別好。老婆也特別喜歡，作為他們的攜程第一位客人，真的覺得特別幸運，很推薦體驗一次。早餐的麪條很棒，尤其師傅調的醬汁，很贊。當然早餐可以更豐富一些～期待春暖花開的時候再次入住

msg:房間整潔，有很多藝術小設計，關中傳統民宿老物件和現代簡約設計混搭令人耳目一新。窗外能看到重巒疊嶂的山景，在夕陽的餘暉下襯得好似誤闖山水墨畫。房間設施齊全，柔軟的床鋪把人疲憊一掃而空。入住帶的早飯頗具當地特色，西餐廳環境很棒，用餐體驗滿分。這裡是有名的美術館酒店，閑暇時還能去看看大師佳作，講解員都是美院畢業的，對每幅名家作品的介紹跟理解都非常好。酒店工作人員服務都很好很熱情，可以説是無微不至。很適合帶愛人來一場浪漫之旅。

msg:幾個月之前就開始規劃開春的西施故里浪漫之旅，幾番比較，最終選擇了雲滿屋，一是酒店坐落於山間，酒店整體設計風格是我偏好的，江南園林，亭台樓閣，房間窗外的景觀也是非常漂亮，落日黃昏簡直不要太舒服了，二是因為裏面還藏着一家美術館，可以感受藝術的氣息
  酒店是含早餐的，説到這個，必須説一下他們的粥，早餐居然有海蔘乾貝粥，味道絕棒的，一碗沒喝夠管服務員又要了一份，在此實名推薦！餐廳的氛圍也是非常好，下午也可以點上一杯咖啡，悠悠哉哉~
酒店內休閑方面，有一塊天幕區域，下午可以去曬曬陽光放個風，邊上還有一些小童設施，小朋友還可以在那裡玩耍，非常適合親子出遊
好想再待上幾天，但這次行程比較短，下次有機會一定多住上幾天
