I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to Ada for her enthusiastic service; her meticulous attention made me feel truly at home. The next time I visit Haikou, I will undoubtedly choose this delightful Langham again. Thank you for your thoughtful hospitality.

매달 하이커우를 방문하는 비즈니스 여행자로서, 이번 숙박 경험은 나에게 깊은 인상을 남겼습니다. Ada 의 열정적인 서비스에 깊은 감사를 표하고 싶습니다. 그녀의 세심한 배려로 인해 집 같은 편안함을 느꼈습니다. 다음에 하이커우를 방문할 때도 이 즐거운 랭엄을 선택할 것입니다. 소중한 환대에 감사드립니다.

You can see the sunset through the floor-to-ceiling windows in the room. It was really beautiful. The breakfast of the hotel was very rich, with a variety of food for me to choose from. In addition, the hotel is in a very good location. The Vientiane City and Aga Bar are downstairs, which is very convenient for shopping, dining and entertainment. I will stay in this hotel again when the weather is more comfortable, and I strongly recommend it to my friends.

msg:We originally planned to stay for only one night, but the experience was very good and we didn't want to change rooms, so we stayed for another night. After communicating with the hotel service ambassador Mark, Mark applied for us to stay in a room without changing rooms. This May Day trip, the first stop was the Langham. I was very satisfied with my stay. The hotel staff were very nice. If I have the opportunity to come to Haikou in the future, I will choose this hotel.

Romantic French style, pink flowers attract me as soon as I enter

The fragrance is intoxicating

Check in in seconds, and they are very considerate to meet my needs

The luggage will be delivered to the room

The room is large enough, the bathroom is separated into dry and wet areas, and the double basin design is very convenient

Although it is on a high floor, there is plenty of hot water

The mattress and bedding are very comfortable, and there are many choices of pillows

(The air conditioning in the elevator is very sufficient)

The Mixc is downstairs, and there are many delicious takeaways to order

It takes about 30 minutes to get to Meilan Airport

Full score, full score, it should be a hotel that most girls will like

Decorating is all about my hobby. Very a**ospheric and tasteful.
And the service is very good, because every time I come here is the off-season, the front desk will always help me upgrade the room type. It's really nice.
The food is also good. If there are many people, you can try the 188-person meal buffet at noon. It is really delicious and it is local food.
The breakfast in the morning was also quite rich. Since I was losing weight, I didn't dare to eat too much. The juice was very fresh.
PS, it was Goddess' Day when I checked in, and they thoughtfully gave me a rose. I really don't know what to say.

Service ambassador Julie provided butler-style Langham service, arranged the room of our choice, and also helped us delay our check-out time due to flight reasons.
As soon as we entered the lobby, we were attracted by the British style of the hotel. There are many female fans and it is suitable for couples traveling or honeymoon. The aroma in the lobby is unique.
The only regret is that the weather in Haikou was not very good when we checked in. It was foggy. I will contact Julie to arrange the trip next time when the weather is good.

When we returned to the room at around 8pm, the room card could not be scanned. We had no choice but to go to the 43rd floor. The front desk confirmed that we extended the room and unlocked our room card. What does it mean that the room we extended at noon was locked again at night? We had to run to the front desk non-stop. Do we have a lot of time? 🥲Except for the service attitude, everything else is very good, including the environment and hygiene. The room layout is what I like. The cleaning is also in place. But if this situation of room card not being able to be swiped happens again in the future, it will be really invincible.

msg:During this self-driving trip to Hainan, I stayed at Le Meridien, Conian, Hilton, and Langham. For the last stop, I chose The Langham in Haikou. The hotel is convenient for traveling in the city. Half of the rooms have city views plus sea views. The hotel is nearby Wanlv Garden.
This is not the first time I have stayed at Langham, but the sense of detail, ceremony and service at Langham are as good as ever. Hotel check-in is on the 43rd floor. Tang Ge’s food is not to be missed. The restaurant’s quality is as good as ever.
Special thanks to Betty who checked in at the front desk. The room had a smell and needed to be moved. The service was prompt and very warm and kind. Because I was shopping in a duty-free shop, the service staff helped me change rooms. My luggage and items were placed as they were when I left the room, and even the drinks were placed in the same location. These details left a deep impression on me. Overall, I'm very satisfied. The Langham is my first choice when traveling to Haikou.

The concierge staff on the first floor will take care of the guests' luggage when they arrive. The lobby is on the 43rd floor; what I want to say is that the elevator is fast and stable. The room is as seen from every platform, Langham style, exquisite in every corner. It is worth mentioning that when I checked out, I met the service ambassador Ada, who noticed me waiting. So she took the initiative to greet us and asked if there was anything she could do to help us, which made the moment of leaving the store a little warmer.

msg:2680 per night for an executive sea view room. To be honest, I was very disappointed. I stayed in a deluxe room the day before. I thought it would be better for New Year's Eve, so I changed to an executive sea view room on New Year's Eve. Except for the layout of the house, it was no different from the deluxe room. There was no difference! The room size and equipment implementation are the same, and there is no so-called sea view at all. Unless there is a free room upgrade, please be careful if you book an executive room on your own, as you are being taken advantage of.
      As for the service, except for the doorman who is quite smart, the others really have not received any training. The staff wear slippers and walk in the lobby. No one greets the cleaning staff or other staff in the hotel.
      Because I stayed for several consecutive days and had to change rooms on the last day, I placed separate orders and explained the situation to the front desk in advance. However, when I checked in, the front desk was extremely unprofessional. After waiting for more than ten minutes, I finally found the order and finally gave When I received the room card, I didn't mention changing rooms on the last day. After taking the initiative to ask, I checked for a long time and was told that I could handle it at the front desk on the last day. There was no mention of breakfast time, where the breakfast room was, the opening hours of the gym, etc., but I still took the initiative to ask. It was very late when I checked in, and there was no one waiting to check in. The front desk was not in a hurry.
      On the last day, I was anxious to catch a flight and had to leave at 7:30. I didn't have time to go to the breakfast restaurant (meals open at 7), so I called the front desk to ask if they could send breakfast to the room. Without any hesitation, the front desk told me that breakfast must be eaten directly in the restaurant and cannot be delivered. I have stayed in many hotels, whether they are five-star hotels or express hotels, and I have never encountered one where food delivery was not possible. So I argued with the front desk, and the front desk said that there was a separate fee for delivering meals. I said that my room included meals, but I just couldn't make it in time, so I could just deliver whatever I wanted. The front desk said to ask, if possible, they would send some bread, yogurt, fruit, etc., I said yes. I got a call back later and said it could be sent. After waiting for a while, breakfast was delivered. I put the photos behind and looked at them myself. I didn't eat anything and just checked out and left, so it's hard to comment.

msg:Because the front desk adjusted the room in the end and was basically satisfied with the results, I will not give a low score. Don't sell those rooms with side-to-side sea views as sea-view rooms. It's so disappointing. Moreover, the swimming pool is cold and not at a constant temperature. You can't go into the water at all during New Year's Day. There are relatively few types of breakfast, but there are noodle stalls, chicken, duck and fish. It is considered a five-star standard. It is open until 11 o'clock and I am very satisfied. The room is cleaned in a timely manner and the service is good in other aspects, especially the doorman. The service is really good. Please add chicken legs.

msg:This time I went to Haikou alone for business and checked into The Langham after reading the reviews. I arrived at the hotel at 1 a.m. to check in. When I entered the room, I found that there was no window in the reception area, so I called the front desk to ask if I could change to a room with a window. The front desk replied that there was no window. Because I have booked a room for three days, some friends will come to me to drink tea in the room and ask them to try their best to arrange it. The guy at the front desk still couldn't arrange it and said he could check out if he wasn't satisfied. I told Ctrip that my order could not be cancelled. The young man replied that it was OK. I just needed to click cancel under the order and he would confirm the check-out. I said I needed to book a hotel, and he replied that I should leave as soon as possible. After hanging up, I thought about it. I am not familiar with Haikou. It is already 2 am. I insisted on checking out the room until 9 am. This is the first time I have experienced such poor service. The service does not match that of a five-star hotel. Haikou is a tourist city, and hotels represent a city’s business card. Tourists’ requirements for hotels are safety and comfort. I was very disappointed with the service this time.

msg:I had an extremely bad experience staying at The Langham, Haikou, and I would like to share my experience in the hope that it will serve as a reference for other potential customers. From November 23 to 24, 2023, I booked a deluxe room at the Langham Hotel through Ctrip. Upon checking in, I met Julie ****, the front desk manager on duty, and her attitude was unbelievable. I waited at the front desk for nearly 10 minutes. She had been handling business for others. At the same time, other front desks next to her had successfully handled 7-8 people, and she kept me waiting for a long time. Secondly, she told me that the deluxe rooms I booked on Ctrip can only be arranged in the first and last rooms (please note!! If you book the second room type, you can only be in the first and last rooms). Ms. Julie pointed out that this is the company's policy. As far as I know and the follow-up After verifying this with Ctrip, there is no relevant rule that the second room type is the first and last room. When I made a reasonable request not to have the first and last rooms, Julie repeatedly told me five times with an extremely bad attitude that according to my booking type, only the first and last rooms could be arranged, and repeatedly stressed that I needed to pay extra to upgrade to other room types ( I don’t believe that all reservations for this room type can only be for first and last rooms and there is no relevant regulation on Ctrip’s page). I have never encountered this situation when I stayed at the Langham Hotel many times before, and I didn't get any reminder when booking. What's even more annoying is that when I asked to contact a higher-level manager to discuss the matter, after waiting for 2 hours, Julie not only ignored me, but also loudly told me that she was the top person in charge of that day and would handle me. Complaints can only be handled by her. After some fruitless communication, she also suggested that I could choose to check out and stay in another hotel. As a five-star hotel, this kind of service and handling is really unacceptable. This is not my first time staying at The Langham, Haikou. The decoration style of this hotel is really good, but I still want to remind all friends who plan to stay at The Langham, Haikou, to book this room type with caution, and recommend Langham Ting Hotel has strengthened staff training to prevent customers from having such an unpleasant stay experience. My experience this time was not only disappointing, but also a serious blow to my trust in the Langham brand. Please think twice before booking to avoid a similar bad experience.

msg:Eight of us were on a business trip to Haikou and ordered five sets and one pair from Langham. The boss designated me to stay at the Langham Hotel twice, saying that the location was convenient, the room was comfortable, and the environment was beautiful. The check-in was indeed British style. We checked in on the 43rd floor. The view outside the window was very beautiful. Lilly, the receptionist who checked us in, was very enthusiastic, professional and dedicated. She quickly arranged the room according to our needs, and many of our requests were also met. Time helped us coordinate the solution. In the evening, he and his colleagues carefully arranged a warm birthday celebration for us and worked until very late. The staff at the hotel concierge and cafeteria also provided very professional services, making us truly feel at home. !

Although the hotel opened in 2016, the hotel's facilities, equipment, carpets, cabinets, etc. are extremely well maintained and super clean. It is in sharp contrast to the hotels I have stayed in in Sanya before.

The entire hotel is in pink, with flowers everywhere, and it will make you feel super good. You will also get a rose when you check in🌹, which is full of ritual feeling, and the palace-like decoration can also be photographed.

The location is super convenient. It takes 3 minutes to walk to Vientiane City. It is very convenient for eating and shopping. There are also Guomao and Wanlvyuan nearby.

I am very grateful to the front office manager Lily for her service. The Langham, Haikou will undoubtedly be my first choice next time I come to Haikou, and I will recommend it to my friends.

The hotel lobby is on the 43rd floor of the apar**ent, with a great view. The front desk staff are also very enthusiastic, and check-in is also very fast.

Room facilities:
The room is in modern French style, and the overall white decoration is very bright.

Room view:
The view outside the window overlooks the park downstairs and the Century Bridge in the distance. The scenery is great!

swimming pool:
The swimming pool on the 6th floor is worth experiencing. When the sun sets and the night lights come on, swimming and taking photos will be very pleasant.

The most interesting thing is that the hotel can provide girls with a one-hour French palace dress-up experience. They can check in and take photos in every corner of the hotel, which is very photogenic.

All in all, it was a very satisfying stay experience!

The hotel is located on Binhai Avenue, Longhua District, Haikou City, opposite Wanlv Garden. The entrance of the hotel is a bit small, it is a British-style building, and the fragrance in the lobby is very nice. I don't know what kind of aromatherapy it is. Maybe it's because it's a business hotel. The hotel doesn't have a garden and the area is small. The facilities are okay. The swimming pool is on the sixth floor. It rained the day we checked in and we didn't have time to use it. The experience is quite good, the only drawback is that there is a large construction site next to it, which is a bit disruptive. What impressed me most was Mark, the front desk manager, who took the initiative to ask if he needed an invoice after checking out.

The hotel is a British-style building and a British hotel brand. There are not many hotels of this brand in China, and this is the only one in Hainan. We arrived at the hotel at noon and booked a sea-view twin room. The person who checked us in was the hotel's Ctrip steward Mark. Mark was very professional and had a good service attitude. He also introduced us to the hotel restaurant information. Due to other travel arrangements, I only stayed for one day, but the experience was as great as ever. I give these five stars to Mark. You can contact him in advance when you come back in the future.

msg:Haikou hotel recommendation → Haikou Langham YYDS
The most important thing is to feel safe when staying in a hotel. You need to take a room card to reach the hotel floor. The price/performance ratio is higher than that in Shanghai. The service has not declined. It smells great!
Ken, the front desk staff, was very attentive and recommended us a convenient guide for starting from the west line of Hainan Island. I went to play all the fun and saved time. I was able to go home before the Double Festival and had a lot of fun 😂. The moon is the brightness of my hometown. I wish you all a happy Mid-Autumn Festival! !

We moved from the InterContinental Hotel in Haidian Island to the Langham Hotel. We had stayed at this hotel before and had a good impression, so we came back again. The entrance of the hotel is a bit small. Parking is on the second underground floor. You can go to the lobby from the parking lot, which is also convenient. The room was arranged by Manager Xiao Li at the front desk, who is also the hotel's housekeeper for Ctrip. We are very satisfied with the arrangement of the room. It is clean and has a beautiful sea view. Thank you Manager Xiao Li. When checking out, they also helped us deliver our luggage to the door. The service was really good and it was a satisfying experience.

As the last hotel in Haikou, we chose this hotel after comparing online and reading reviews. The hotel is a British brand. When you check into the hotel, your luggage is delivered to the room.

After a comprehensive evaluation, I chose Langham. I was a bit surprised! No thunder! Miss Ada was very enthusiastic when checking in! Gave me two roses 🥰 and upgraded me to an executive room. The service was very satisfactory! Super praise!
When I checked out, I was in a hurry and left my keys at home. The hotel staff actively contacted me and helped me put them on the first floor! grateful!
The outdoor scenery is also very nice! I will choose this restaurant next time I come to Haikou! No ads! From the heart!

msg:The pink car at the door is very iconic. When you get off, the doorman comes down to help carry the suitcases. When we checked in, there was probably a wedding. The elevator smelled bad. There were several bags of takeaways next to the elevator trash can on the floor. They were not cleaned. The location of the hotel is better. The arcade is not far away and there are restaurants nearby. It is convenient for travel. The rooms are clean and good. The facilities are relatively complete. The water in the water bar is not free. If you need it, you can check the price list. The soundproofing of the hotel is not very good. The mother next door is educating her son clearly at 1 o'clock in the morning. There was a power outage twice in the morning. The decoration was generally quite comfortable. Even if you stay in the hotel on a rainy day, you won't feel annoyed. The sea view room can see the sea and it is still very beautiful. The hotel is very suitable for taking pictures, but it was quite late when I arrived. I got up early the next day and left so I didn’t take any photos. Overall, it was a good review.

The avenue next to the hotel was lined with coconut trees, which felt very island-style. The hotel lobby is on the 43rd floor with a breathtaking view. Brother Mark arranged a room for us and gave us a pack of coconut sugar from Hainan. There was also fruit in the room.

Hahaha, I'll choose again next time. The Vientiane City next door has a lot of things. I hope the luxury on the first floor is also there. I can show up as soon as possible, thanks to Xiao Li Janson at the front desk for the reception. When I checked in, I would introduce a lot of places to eat, drink and have fun, as well as things in the hotel. I will reply one by one when the door opens and closes. Thank you for being really attentive! This trip is also very happy, a very good experience, looking forward to seeing you next time!

The room design is very a**ospheric and clean. The location of the room is right where you can see the park. It is very comfortable... If there are many people, try to arrange the same floor as much as possible. Cards must be swiped on different floors, so it is not convenient to visit.

Everyone has a sincere smile on their faces. I need to praise it, and at the same time Praise the customer service team for speaking clearly and with a correct attitude. Thank you Janson for his service. The subwoofer’s voice is very charming. Hahaha. If there are places I don’t know where to go, he can also tell me in time how to get there, which road is the closest, and where things are cheap. Where is the food expensive? It's really good. The hotel's breakfast tastes good. I hope there are more varieties. I like to eat more Hainan-style things. See you next time~

The midnight snack menu is also very good. I ordered a pasta. Checking in the hotel also gave a shopping voucher for a duty-free shop. I feel that the price/performance ratio is still very high.
       The hotel room has a sea view. When you open the curtains, you can see the check-in point of the Century Bridge, and you can also see a little sunset. The photo should be very good, and the night view is also beautiful. The surrounding area is very convenient.

msg:The warm reception at the main station reflects the standard of a five-star hotel, and they upgraded our room for us, which is very touching.
Lazy days always start from the swimming pool, there are not many people, but the scenery is beautiful, recommended!
The breakfast is average, neither rich nor shabby, passing.
Hygiene is generally okay, but there is still room for improvement.
The porters are very welcoming.
What is relatively unsatisfactory is the hotel's air conditioner. I don't know if it's because of energy saving or design. The room didn't cool down completely after 30 minutes of check-in. The housekeeper asked the engineer to look at it. The two good guys did the repairs and measured the temperature of the air outlet. It was about 20 degrees, but the temperature in the room did not drop until night. It should be a problem with the air volume, or only fresh air? In a hot place, for our guests who are used to coolness, they hope to return to the hotel from the hot street, and the refreshing air-conditioning can drive away people's fatigue, but Langham definitely can't do it. Although the lobby is still cool, we had the same problem in the three rooms. The air conditioner was basically sufficient until it started to rain the next day. But you know, the contrast between hot and cool is also a kind of enjoyment, which is quite a pity.
All in all, the regional location or most of the services, including the hardware, are fine, fine. But for the air conditioner, it may be difficult for me to choose to stay again. After all, the mild coolness and the rich and powerful air conditioner, I value the latter more, especially in summer, in the hot Haikou...

msg:I really can't give a good review this time. When I checked in, I told the boy at the front desk to ask for an extra breakfast. He hesitated and looked reluctant and said that if you go to bed late tomorrow or forget to have breakfast, I understand. He reluctantly agreed after saying that I would not miss breakfast because I had to catch a flight the next day. When I was about to leave the front desk after checking in, I confirmed with him again whether he had reserved breakfast for me, and he said I would add it for you later. As a result, when I went to the breakfast room the next morning, I was told that I had not made a reservation for breakfast, and I also brought my beloved teacher with me. I had originally invited the teacher to have breakfast with me and catch up on old times. It was really embarrassing. I am very shocked and angry at the service attitude and quality of this male front desk employee. I also hope that your hotel can give me a response. The room number is 2916, the check-in date is 12/22, and the check-out date is 12/23.

msg:Traveling to Haikou with my family, I decided to choose the Langham Hotel because of my friend’s recommendation. To be honest, the concierge service in the lobby on the first floor was very warm and good. He gave me a luggage tag and told me that the front desk was on the 43rd floor. After check-in Give the luggage tag to the front desk, and then they will send the luggage to my room. The timely service is very warm and very good, and the hotel has a rich variety of breakfast, which is also very good. The service is good. The service ambassador, Ms. Leesa, warmly introduces the hotel and other places Thank you very much for the excellent service at the nearby scenic spots. The Langham Club on the 42nd floor has a very good service, and the view from the lobby bar on the 43rd floor is also super helpful, especially at night. Each has its own beauty during the day. The room arranged by the service ambassador leesa It's also very appropriate. I like the location and orientation. Leesa's caring service and serious work attitude are really good. It's the first time I've met such a dedicated waiter. It's worthy of praise. I slept very comfortably and soundly at night. It's a pity that I checked out the next day because the itinerary changed. The recommendation from my friend did not disappoint me. Next time I will choose The Langham, a very cozy hotel with good service from the staff. The check-in experience is very very very very satisfying. [rose] [rose] [rose]

I kept calling to ask about the continuation or check-out situation, and I still have a little regret.

msg:It's the first time I come to Haikou and live in The Langham, the whole experience is very good.
When you get off the taxi, the waiter will open the door enthusiastically, take your luggage and press the elevator, and you will go directly to the 43rd floor for check-in.
👍Lobby manager Julie Wang 👍helped us choose the double bed room with the best view of the sea, and surprised us with roses and a welcome fruit plate. When we checked out the next day, Manager Wang specially told us Farewell in person, and gave us Langham's characteristic pink notepad as a souvenir👍
I like the decoration style of the hotel very much. It is clean and tidy. The infinity outdoor swimming pool is very enjoyable.
There are two fly in the oin**ent:
1. The head of our bed is next to the TV in the next room. At night, the sound of the TV next door is louder, and we can all hear it
2. The free bottled water in the hotel is pure water. Drinking it is not as comfortable as natural water mineral water. It would be better if you can drink natural water instead.

msg:I stayed in Haikou for a few days during this holiday and stayed in several hotels. The Langham is the best and most satisfying one. The check-in experience is very good. From the lobby service in the lobby to the bellman on the first floor, the service attitude is very good, especially a compliment Xiaowei, the porter, provided good service. He delivered luggage when we checked in. He also recommended a lot of delicious restaurants, and his service attitude was enthusiastic. He cast TV and watched football games, which was very good! It must be seriously praised! I have stayed in too many luxury hotels in Hainan City. I have booked more than 3.5K+. The Langham is my favorite. From the European-style decoration style to the room bedding to the details of hotel services, the location makes people feel very convenient , It’s very comfortable to go out. At this price, the price/performance ratio is simply too high. The room is mainly white and has super floor-to-ceiling windows. I like it very much. It is very suitable for young people who come to Haikou after looking for simplicity and fashion. This is what a five-star hotel should look like. The equipment is also very new. After a look at the decoration, I am willing to spend a lot of money to hire a famous designer. If you come to Haikou in the future, you must choose Langham! Very worth recommending!

A reliable good friend decisively chose Langting Hotel, the location, environment and style are very good! The style is completely different from the Sanya Seaview Hotel we stayed in. The most important thing is that the service of the hotel is good, the air is dry, and the high floors give us a stunning view. The night view is especially good. The rooms are decorated in an exquisite light luxury style, full of luxury, and the terrace on the 6th floor The infinity pool is the children's favorite! The surrounding area is very convenient. It is very convenient to the Yundong Library and Qilou Old Street. The Yunnan Provincial Museum is worth visiting! What must be praised is that every waiter in the hotel is very nice and polite. I would like to thank the concierge Sam Xiaowu for serving us very proactively, and also thank Xiao Huang for the warm service in the western restaurant. Like it very much!

I checked in at the lobby and didn't wait. The service attitude was very good. I checked in immediately without waiting. The room was super It's clean, there are guests' names on the TV, welcome to check in, full of details, and the waiters greet you when they pass by. This time, for special reasons, we went to the hotel lobby to inquire about the epidemic after eating the buffet, and we happened to meet the front office manager of the hotel. Manager Chen Fanghong, she chatted with us very patiently. When we needed to know that our room had not been booked for the next day, she immediately renewed the reservation for us and helped us a lot, because I still had a baby, which was very inconvenient. During the period, I kept asking on WeChat. Have you eaten breakfast, where can you do nucleic acid and other warm inquiries, because of special reasons, the check-out was delayed a little later. Manager Chen Fanghong was really like a friend, he made us feel warm, comfortable and at ease! Including contacting with WeChat after checking out later, there is really no hotel staff who can do this, thank you very much, thank you! Really great! There is also the lobby on the first floor. Because of my own negligence, I forgot the child's cup. We thought it fell on the taxi and planned to give up. As a result, when we returned to the lobby on the first floor of the hotel, the little brother helped We put away the water glasses and gave them to us. Wow, it was really... The Langham Hotel is really good service, the hotel environment is good, the room is good, the location is also super good, the city center, opposite the Vientiane City, it is very convenient to eat and shop, in short, I highly recommend it. recommend!

The service of the hotel is as always thoughtful and warm, very considerate. Starting from the doorman, to the front desk, guest rooms, restaurants, every service staff I met was very professional and enthusiastic, making me feel at home!
The breakfast variety is very rich, dazzling and satisfying. In particular, Hainan hot and sour noodles must be eaten every time, and I will never forget it after I leave.
This time, I also ate the dim sum buffet for lunch at the Chinese restaurant Tang Ge in the hotel. There are many choices. The taste and quality of the dishes are all online. Very authentic Cantonese dim sum, black truffle shrimp dumplings, money belly, durian crisps, quicksand buns are highly recommended !
Must come back next time!

The service of booking Haikou is very good. I booked a deluxe sea view room. I called one day in advance to confirm the check-in time and needs. I said that I am a little bit at a loss for the executive room. . I felt that the sea view of the sea view room was not correct enough, so the front desk helped me upgrade the sea view suite with the best price. I am very grateful to Xiaofen for the hairtail. In addition, the spa is also very comfortable. The technician Lisa has very good services and techniques. The hotel offers 398 for one hour of body or face, which can be superimposed and very affordable. I also took an essential oil bath. The hotel prepared a pot of ginger and brown sugar water for me. I drank it while soaking, and it actually soaked me with a cold.

Saved our surprise and gave my husband and I a perfect anniversary.

Among all hotels in Hainan, Lang Ting is chosen. In addition to the invincible view of the sea, I really like the decoration of not-so-business hotels, and the pale pink beauty that perfectly matches the anniversary.
Aside from all the basic equipment of a high-star hotel, the quick response and feedback, and the proactive but not overly enthusiastic attitude of the staff made me extremely comfortable, and I deeply liked this hotel.


There are so many things that Hainan wants to eat. It's a pity that I didn't check in the Tang Pavilion. I will come again next time~

Location: Very close to Wanlv Garden (but I didn't go there), quiet in the middle of the hustle and bustle, there are a lot of shops around, you can walk and eat in a few minutes, very satisfied.
Service: Before the trip, the hotel staff will call to inquire about the needs, and also inquire about the experience of staying at the hotel when leaving the hotel. I am very satisfied with the turndown, that is, after going out for dinner and shopping at night, the room has been tidy up for you, which is very good.
I read a lot of popular hotels in the reviews before, and now I find that as long as you choose the right hotel, you really don't need to go to the Internet celebrity shop to check in, eat and shop nearby, and feel the local customs, which is very comfortable.

Langham is a brand that I like to live in every time I go to Hong Kong. I saw the Langham Hotel in Haikou. I chose this place as the first choice. It really did not disappoint me. Langham still maintains its consistent quality. From the beginning of the fragrance, I felt the exquisiteness of the hotel. The room is still in Langham's style, light and luxurious, and the bathroom is beautifully decorated with a bathtub. It's very big, because I brought a baby, so I carefully prepared the baby's toiletries. The quality of the crib is the best one I've ever stayed in in a five-star hotel in Haikou. The outdoor swimming pool is very good, but I didn't feel the cold weather. Dry steaming and wet steaming are very good. You can try it. The quality of breakfast is very good, and the fruit is very fresh!

msg:Traveling to Haikou with my family, I prefer Langham, so I chose Langham. Booked two rooms for two nights. The hotel has been in use for several years, and I thought the facilities were outdated, but I was pleasantly surprised when I arrived at the hotel. The location of the hotel is very good and the transportation is convenient. There are several shopping malls within a ten minute walk. Lots of food and shopping. Not far from all attractions. The view from the hotel room is good. You can see Wanlv Garden, sea view and Century Bridge. It's nice to see the view from the room on a rainy day. Special thanks to Lynn, some hotel lobby managers. There were some episodes during the stay. Lynn apologized very sincerely and resolved it quickly. Originally, I had to change the hotel for the third night. Lynn's attitude was very good, so I continued to stay in the suite for one night. (I was already disappointed with The Langham, Haikou, and lynn made me willing to give it another chance.) The view from the suite is better. In addition to the hardware facilities, the service is also really important when staying in a hotel. If you are traveling with the whole family, the Langham is highly recommended. (In addition, the sanitation of the hotel really needs to be strengthened. At present, it does not meet the five-star standard. Next time I go to Haikou, I will choose Langham to see if there is any improvement.)

msg:This trip to Hainan is the most satisfactory hotel, no one. It has always maintained the European style of Langting. There is really nothing to say about the century-old brand, and the overall experience is basically impeccable.
🚗 Transportation: The city center is not far from the Wanlvyuan Duty Free Shop. very convenient
🧹Hygiene: The bed is very comfortable. Hygiene is very clean. European style is actually very inconvenient to clean. But the overall hygiene is quite ok
🍃Environment: The hotel has arranged a sea view room with a good view. It's nice to eat something in the house and play with the phone. The overall environment is very comfortable, the aroma of the hotel rose is very natural, my mother likes it very much.
🔔Service: This must be praised. The service of the hotel is very active, including the gift of flowers. We came earlier and arranged for a rest in the executive gallery. The flight sensitivity to Lang Ting is up. Including hotels also have a set of overall service procedures and standards. It's a pity that I didn't experience Chuan Spa and Lang Ting's signature afternoon tea this time. It was a pleasure to stay with my mother. The family is also satisfied. Will prefer next time

msg:I have applied for a birthday arrangement. Thank you, the hotel ambassador, Xiaolan, who called me a day in advance to ask me the time of arrival and said that I would try my best to arrange a small cake. The porter is also very online after arrival and departure. The service is in place. The front desk depar**ent has been in contact for two days. The service is cold and talking like a robot. The feeling of indifference is expressionless. In addition, the housekeeping depar**ent does not take the initiative to clean the room. Call to clean the room and make up water for the New Year's water cut off service? The room attendant probably thought that we had left the store at around 1 pm on the day we left. We didn't knock on the door and swiped the card to open the door. Although there was an apology, I was not embarrassed. She was speechless. This is not what should happen in this class of hotel. Shouldn't the low-level mistakes that star hotels do not make should knock on the door first? After thinking about it carefully, the housekeeping depar**ent only has active cleaning service before check-out and no intermediate service. I think this gives me a bad impression. I have stayed in hotels all over Hainan in the past two months. Checking in Langham because I prefer the style. The location is good. I PASS myself. Hilton, who enjoys the reception of a senior member, does give me this kind of memory... But the food at the restaurant, Tang Court, especially dinner, is still very online.

msg:It was an old-fashioned hotel in London that started in 1856. After so many years, it now belongs to the Great Eagle Group of Hong Kong. It is a high-end boutique hotel. I personally think its positioning is similar to that of Conrad and Fairmont. The hotel is in the European court style. Now the mainstream boutique hotels are designed in a cold style. The Langham can be said to be a bit maverick. The overall a**osphere makes me feel like I am in Macau, especially the style of Macau. The house is not very big, but Very bright and warm, there are many mirrors, very "exaggerated" feeling, bathrooms are all Kohler, spare parts own brand Chuan CHUAN, the theme color is pink, very tender, it is still very fresh to live once in a while. I have nothing to say about the service. I will take the initiative to guide me when I want to go to the gym. There is a good Hong Kong-style restaurant, there is a turndown service (I think it is a plus point), an outdoor swimming pool (but it is too cold in winter), sweating and steaming, There are actually many foreign TV programs, which can be said to be very precious. The downside is that the gym is slightly small and there is no balcony. Across the road is Wanlv Garden, which is very suitable for running. Leeds is a bit far from the city, so I didn't go there. Overall, it can be said that The Langham is the number one Internet celebrity hotel in Haikou.

Xiaolin of Chuan Spa also gave a good massage, but unfortunately I didn't see the discount package in advance, otherwise I can press it a few more times. The only problem with the hotel is that the parking lot cannot log in the license plate. It is very inconvenient to scan the code every time you go out to get free parking! Even the guests have to do it all the time and hope this can be improved.
In the breakfast part, the enthusiasm of the service staff is not enough, the closing of the table is very slow, there is a big problem in management, the service awareness is not enough, but the attitude of the staff is very good, so it would be much better if the speed was faster

First of all, the advantage is that the service attitude is good, and the hotel is generally beautiful, which is very suitable for girls and friends to come out and live together
Disadvantages, 1. The little sister was very considerate to give the extra-large bed room, the result... It was two 1.25 beds spliced together, and there was a large gap between the head of the bed and the bed, which was very speechless. 2. A five-star hotel can't do the minimum sanitation. There is a layer of gray on the table above the cabinet. Is this really what it should be? 3. The hair dryer is not working well, please ask the hotel to help you replace it, waited for 20 minutes, and waited until the hair was dry, and it was only delivered after a second call! 4. Is the hotel breakfast really worth the price? If you have a little hope for the hotel breakfast, please destroy yourself. Breakfast is almost all staple foods, including hot noodles, fried noodles, fried rice, all kinds of bread, about three fried vegetables, and some intestines, and then It's just a few kinds of fruits and drinks, and the dining area is the smallest five-star hotel I've ever seen.
All in all, it's a bad experience

msg:I stayed in Langham for six days this time. After staying in 19 years, I left a good impression. This time I chose to find that the service was much worse. I took two babies to live. The children need to make milk powder and have an extra demand for mineral water. There are only 4 bottles of water on the bar, but no bathroom. That is to say, the two large and two small only give four bottles of water. The answer I asked the staff for water is only 4 bottles. I said that the child needs to make milk, he said You can make water for pipes, the same. Later I responded to this question from the service center, and the answer to me was that we only gave 4 bottles of water. I said yes, then I won't live anymore! She did not respond, saying that it was only after I responded to the front desk in the lobby that I responded to the need. I stayed for 6 days, and only after a minor problem occurred, did the welcome fruit be delivered, and in the morning after it was known that I was staying for a long time I didn’t come to clean the room. I called to urge the request for two days, and I didn’t turn down the bed. Although it is not as good as a resort hotel in Sanya, it also combines tourism. There is no service concern for children, which is very poor and the facilities are also good. Somewhat old

msg:When I came to Haikou, I was torn between Langham, Sofitel, and Hilton. I finally chose Langham. Now I don’t regret it too much. This Langham is really toxic.

The reason I chose Langham is simple. My impression of other Langhams is much better than Sofitel and Hilton, and it looks really good in the photos. Although The Langham is not a top five-star hotel brand in the world, I have stayed in quite a few. When I went to Hong Kong as a child, I basically stayed at the Langham Hotel in Hong Kong. I also stayed at the Langham Donghai Hotel in Shenzhen many times. I even stayed at the Langham in Los Angeles. But this Langham is the worst of all the Langhams I have stayed at so far. Except that the decoration style of this Langham hotel is very similar to Langham, it does not meet Langham standards at all.

Let’s talk about service first. I recognize the professionalism of this hotel's service, but overall it's really unsatisfactory. Let me talk about the concierge first. He gave people a very "lazy" feeling. He opened the car door and left without even saying hello. The concierge is the first employee that guests meet when they arrive at the hotel. As a result, he doesn't even bother to say "good afternoon". It's not just any concierge, it's almost every concierge. Let’s talk about cleaning. As soon as I entered the room, I found a large core under the bedside table, similar to the core of a jackfruit. This is really a lonely place to check. You said it would be fine if you didn't find the watermelon seeds. Can't you even see such a big core? Then there is the daily cleaning work, which is really lazy to the extreme. The tea cup was not returned to its original position in the minibar, and the hair dryer was not returned to its previous drawer. Taking tips from us is 100 times more positive than doing the work. And this mineral water, only two bottles, is too expensive. Although you can call for mineral water in most hotels, but how many customers would have the audacity to call and ask for a few dollars of mineral water? Let’s talk about the breakfast. It’s really one of the worst breakfasts in any five-star hotel I’ve stayed at this year. There is never anyone to guide you to your seat when you enter the restaurant, and you even have to pour tea yourself. The most outrageous thing was on the last day, when the breakfast receptionist saw me, he said two words: room number. Have such employees received training? Can't you even say a basic "Good morning sir, which room are you staying in?" Then we sat down and didn't even help set the tableware. I could only find a table with tableware and bring the tableware to our table. Let’s talk about the front desk. It is very professional and has the characteristic of giving every lady a flower. His Mandarin is also very standard. I feel that the front desk of your hotel is not like a hotel like other departments. I hope you can reflect on it.

As for the facilities, I can only say that the person who designed this room was either drunk or ****. Why do you think the minibar should not be placed on the wall but in the center of the room? What a hindrance, the whole room feels much smaller. If the reason is that there is a mirror on the wall, then why do you have to put a mirror there? And that toilet door. I never thought that I would stay in a five-star hotel and the toilet door would be broken. You must open the door gently with both hands. You can't open it with one hand; you can't open it with too much force. It took me nearly ten minutes to open this door the first time. Can't you just design a simple sliding door for a toilet? It has to be so complicated. This kind of problem that only occurs in all seasons should not appear in a high-end hotel. Again, it’s a good thing, but it’s useless. Let’s talk about the socket. The two sockets at the bedside often had poor contact, and one of my mother's newly purchased charging cables was damaged. And the Wi-Fi connection drops every minute or two even when I'm lying in bed.

All in all, this Langham almost shattered all my good impressions of this brand. Don’t be fooled by his photos, because apart from the decoration style and the pink taxi at the door, he is completely unworthy of the name Langham. Just stay at Sofitel and Hilton.

msg:The Langham Haikou hotel deserves a good review. I've been to Haikou twice before I stayed at the Hilton next to me. This time the first one also stayed at the Hilton. Haihua Island came back and changed to the Langham Hotel.
First of all, the environment has been greatly improved. They are all sea-view rooms, but the outside view of the house can see the park and the sea-crossing bridge. The scenery is very beautiful.
The second is service. Langham's service intentions are surprising and moving. Please indicate your birthday when booking, upgrade the room, and give you an executive afternoon tea. The decoration of the room is very warm, especially the first-class cakes, chocolate walnut cakes, freshly made and served, the hotel is very attentive. The cake given to Westin in Xiamen last year was very perfunctory and could only be photographed. The W Hotel in Xi'an also gave a symbolic bottle of red wine when checking out. In contrast, the Langham Haikou is very user-friendly and considerate.
Finally, I praise the breakfast quality is very good, the salad with corn red beans and walnuts, many star hotels are not so complete. Cashews are very fresh and sweet. Both walnuts and cashews are highlights. It is recommended to add a baked yellow master.

All in all it is recommended to stay.

msg:Langting should be the ceiling of Haikou Hotel, right?
When booking, this hotel marked deluxe sea-view rooms, but the actual room given to me was not as shown in the pictures. The so-called deluxe sea-view suites are shown in Figure 5-7, not in Figure 4. The difference is very big! I have stayed in a hotel for so many years, and none of the reservation information is so far from the actual situation. When complaining to Ctrip, the customer service insisted that the side sea view was marked, but Figure 4 is my reservation information. Please take a look, where is the side sea view marked? ?
The most annoying thing was the words of the bellman, "You and the Sofitel next door and other hotels have rooms like this. It's not as good as us. If you want to see the sea, you have to book a suite"...
Maybe I had a complaint with Ctrip. Manager Lin at the front desk of the hotel immediately apologized to me very sincerely and changed the suite in time. The view from the suite is a sea view, as shown in Figure 1-2. During the stay, Manager Lin always asked questions about the stay, and gave a gift of red wine. Very nice girl!

What happened this time, I personally think that it is the management of the hotel and the sales problem, and I just stayed for one night, it is not necessary to live in a sea-view room or suite, but your hotel reservation information cannot be so different from the actual one, right? ? ! The sales information of Ctrip's platform is not sorted out in time. The key is the disdainful reply from the bellboy. Is this the job content of the bellboy? In the end, you have to ask the lobby manager to apologize instead! Hotel management reflects the quality of the hotel! ! !

The design of the double sink is very humane, and the supplies are all Lancome. A bit of a pity is the slow replenishment of dishes in the executive lounge, there are few things to drink, and the white wine is not seen.

🧹Sanitation: Generally speaking, the room is cleaned very clean, the facilities are relatively outdated, and the mirrors in the corridors entering the door are oxidized and cannot be seen. There is too little mineral water. This is the hotel I have recently given the least mineral water. I put two bottles in the room every day. The weather in Haikou is really very few. The Fairmont staying in the back, Pullman basically Start with 4 bottles.

🍃Environment: The appearance of Langham Hotel is always online, but after all, taking pictures is only a very small part of staying in the hotel. After all, staying is the focus. I personally think that the cart is upside down.
🔔Service: You can boast about the value of the hotel, the service is great, everywhere, like it.
After the subtitle, let’s talk about the problem. After living in The Langham, Hong Kong, my wife has been obsessed with Langham. Indeed, Langham’s looks are great and the service is great, but it is precisely the most important part that I didn’t pay attention to, just like what I said before. Good photo is only a point. I personally think it is optional. After all, what you need to live in a hotel is to live comfortably, not to take good pictures. Good pictures are only additional points. Breakfast requires serious complaints. I have stayed in so many hotels. The breakfast in a five-star hotel is totally unattainable. It’s so bad that I don’t have any interest in eating it again the next day. The first time I saw all the juices were finished products, I would charge for the a la carte for the first time. It is recommended that you buy it without breakfast, and the seafood buffet for dinner is not good. It is not recommended to try. Let’s just say that if you want to have connotation, you can’t just rely on taking pictures, after all, we are a hotel, not a photo studio.

Sofitel is even better in terms of hardware facilities, but Langham surpasses Sofitel in terms of service.

At the time of the brand cooperation between Langham Haikou and Lancome, Lancome’s camera installations are everywhere in the hotel. The pink color is the same as the Langham Hotel, but the fake flowers everywhere are uncomfortable.

There is also an infinity pool on the 6th floor, which is great for taking pictures.
The whole hotel should be oriented towards business. It is not very friendly to parent-child travelers. There is no parent-child equipment, breakfast is relatively small, western style, and the price is not cheap. Parent-child travellers need to choose more.

Especially on duty manager Wang Qiuling, because the hotel was full that day, she specially helped us choose a room with a beautiful view. During the day, I would sit with friends at the Langham Club for a while. The service staff were very enthusiastic and recommended places to check in for us. Hope to come back again next time.

msg:I came to this hotel with expectations and surprises. I have a little sharing on the 5th anniversary: First of all, I am very grateful to the handsome boy at the front desk for the room arranged for me at the beginning, but there is a strong smell (smoke smell) that I don’t like. +Garlic), so I asked for a room change, but it was very unpleasant in the middle. I waited for an hour before finally arranged a new room for me to change to (it was already 4:30 in the afternoon) and it was only when I was full of urgency. I changed to a new room. I really hate the smelly room. I am very angry. But I am also very grateful to AM-Ken for the final arrangement, and when I returned to the room at 11pm, there was no big surprise to see the fruits and snacks on the table. The hotel does not seem to have a turn-down service. If there is one, please contact me. The staff who have contacted know that I am going back to the room very late, but there is no turn-down service. Hyatt Place Suites in downtown Sanya will have a turn-down service, but generally speaking, I don’t have high requirements for the room and there is no peculiar smell in the room. , Quiet enough, away from the elevator, the staff during the contact is fairly professional, the service center responds quickly, the hotel’s pink room card and the interior design and decoration are very fond of the hotel, I also like the lobby, I have not experienced breakfast and dinner, I don’t know how to swim or go to the infinity pool, but I can see the pool from the window of the room. The overall service still needs to be improved. Don’t let us wait for so long, especially when people are hungry..

The front desk brothers have a good attitude and can try their best to meet any needs

The room is still very quiet 🤫 100% night view
It’s also nice to stay in the room to see the view when it’s hot

In the evening, I went to the first floor to buy a half-folded cake and enjoyed it. The durian cake is delicious.

It’s just that after I drank the refrigerator drink, even though I refilled it, I still charged for it. This is not very flexible.

msg:First of all, the location of the hotel is not mentioned. Secondly, although the infinity pool is not big, the night view is beautiful. This time I went with the old public car and it was very convenient. When I checked in this time, it was a young lady named lucky with a nice name. But the attitude is also very poor, and there is no mention of the hotel’s swimming pool usage time. There is a display on Ctrip that it will give away non-alcoholic cocktails but she said no. Then I have to believe that what is written on Ctrip is what you said, and the activity is over. It's all about it. In short, the attitude is very bad. I don't know how such employees can enter Langham's work through interviews. I hope that other travelers will not be so lucky to run into this lucky. In addition to the extremely poor attitude of the hotel staff, the hotel’s price/performance ratio is still very high. I hope that next time I stay at Langham Haikou, I won’t run into this young lady again.

優點:
酒店房間內部非常漂亮，像住在城堡裏一樣。
離騎樓老街13分鐘車程；
近萬象城，步行3分鐘就到了；
對面萬綠園，穿過萬綠園就到海邊了。
處理問題及時。
待改善:
停車麻煩，每24小時還得去領停車票。
沒有人提前電話聯繫，也沒有酒店管家。
總結:適合喜歡拍照的姐妹，和自駕帶小孩兒的入住。

我訂的是海景房，不但海景衹能看到一半，兩間房都還是個開一段距離的，我提前那麼久訂房，而且提前電話溝通過，您就不能提前為客人事前協調嗎？其次客房非常小，主要靠鏡子補，大家預訂之前有個預期，您如果對空間房間大小有期待，請訂套房起吧。
泳池和早餐同層，在六層，一個室外樓頂泳池，天氣泠的話完全沒法遊。
大家如果是想體驗一下酒店風格，住一兩晚即可。

msg:今年是我們全家第一次去海口，也是跟着攜程推薦入住了朗廷。酒店裝修比較新，設施完備，大堂在47樓，景觀不錯。從大堂和房間都能看到世紀大橋。區位看，距離萬綠園很近。總之，中規中矩的一家高檔酒店吧。缺點：1⃣️房間的隔音必須加強，不要問我為什麼。2⃣️酒店的早餐自助餐價位偏高，我們因為拿不準要不要在酒店用早餐，但是一價位就放棄了。希望新的一年能有所改進。

大堂的衞生裝修都非常的舒適整潔。
前台辦理入住在43樓可以俯視海口的夜景。
唯一感覺不太順暢的就是整個酒店的部門與部門之間的銜接少了點默契。
退房的時候有遺留物，感謝julie及時的聯繫了我們，並且安排了後續的處理。

不過還是有一個小建議，入住房間的淋浴花灑無法取下（其實這點我蠻認同的），但是有一些漏水，且無法調整角度，影響了淋浴體驗。

msg:海口的五星酒店糾結了很久，因為上海新天地朗廷的關係，選擇了海口朗廷。
首先抵達酒店，門口服務小哥絕對五星好評，主動詢問，禮貌問候，耐心解答，幫運行李……雖説是基本要求，但“主動”一詞決定了差異。進入大堂的鮮花芬芳，給人以獨特的記憶點。
酒店大堂在43層，入住正常。客房整體風格保持了一貫性，因此沒有太多挑剔的，唯一是開門後聞到淡淡的煙味，這個在入住時還是建議能提示一下。
含了早餐，到11點的用餐時間很不錯，但是餐食……可能是此行最值得吐槽的--首先是符合五星級酒店標準的，和四星級或者其他類型酒店對比不公平。但是很多住客説品種少，其實不是種類少，而是“記憶點少”，能讓人記住的餐食或者點很缺，比如同樣是煎蛋，單面煎/雙面煎，全熟/流心蛋黃，都是可以變的花樣；再比如粥的配菜，僅僅衹有橄欖菜和酸豆角，選擇少了很多；其他像蒸點，煎炸物等等……理解酒店推自己其他餐廳早餐，但作為酒店業可橫向對比的一項，有點失望。

最後一個問題，如果下次來，還會入住嗎？可能會吧，這次沒機會在唐閣就餐是個小遺憾，但也可能去體驗其他的酒店

msg:酒店的住宿體驗並不令人滿意。服務不到位、員工冷淡且缺乏熱情，房間存在裝修和維護方面的問題，停車場的管理混亂，員工的服務態度不禮貌。

1. 酒店門口十分混亂，停滿了車，導致進出門口的通行非常困難。員工在門口站立，但他們沒有熱情地打招呼或提供任何幫助，給人一種冷淡的感覺。他們似乎缺乏明確的工作職責和指導。

2. 在登記入住的過程中，員工的服務態度也顯得冷淡。他們沒有主動指引我們如何進行登記手續，也沒有告知我們如何前往客房。這使得我們在酒店內迷路了一段時間，沒有員工主動提供幫助或給予指引。

3. 房間的裝潢看似華麗，但仔細觀察後發現許多地方都顯示出殘舊的跡象。例如，廁所的衞生紙架多次掉落，插座也鬆脱，給人一種維護不善的印象。這些問題表明酒店對於房間維護和裝修的質量控制似乎存在問題。

4. 停車場的出入安排也非常混亂。我們得到了不同員工的不一致答覆，有人告訴我們可以直接進出，而另一位員工則告訴我們要掃描二維碼才能通過。這種混亂的訊息給我們造成了困擾和不便。

5. 在掃描二維碼時，員工的態度冷漠且缺乏基本的禮貌。他們衹是冷冷地指着桌上的平板電腦，要求我們自行掃碼。他們沒有提供任何幫助或解答我們可能遇到的問題，這種服務態度令人失望。

總的來説，這些問題使我們的住宿體驗大打折扣，無法滿足我們對一家優質酒店的期望。

可一進酒店，英式的裝修即讓我們喜歡。原訂的2.2米大床房，被換成了2.5米，簡直另人眼前一亮，躺在上面無比舒服。
無論是大堂禮賓還是房間服務員，總讓你有賓至如歸的感覺。
可以説，因為朗廷酒店，讓我們的海口之行開心滿滿！

內心還非常加分的一項就是這酒店裝修太漂亮了我本人非常喜歡 入住和辦理退房都是Janson小李辦理的 動作麻利説話也輕聲細語的 態度無敵好 以後再來海口肯定繼續住這家酒店喜歡喜歡🌹

從一樓大堂到43樓的前台，每位員工都很熱情打招呼，都能主動問候指引，很棒的服務，服務大使Julie提前給打了電話問了房間喜好，安排的很好
房間軟硬件設施都很棒，全房間豪華裝修，全實木，大理石包裹房間，與實木一起打造讓人乾淨、奢華、高級的感覺。入住朗廷酒店真的是很棒的體驗，退房比較着急，忘記開發票了Julie也是第一時間安排處理了，下次一定還會堅定地選擇朗廷！

最喜歡的是泳池，看夜景很漂亮。裏面也有桑拿和蒸氣室。

msg:初次來到海口朗廷酒店，剛到酒店門口就已經能聞到酒店裡飄出的陣陣花香，粉色百合➕荷花苞，這種氣味的迎接讓人心情愉悦🥰
進入一層大廳，看到高挑的接待空間，空間格調是簡約的歐式風格，象牙白牆飾面、灰色的大理石與淺色的牆紙相搭配，再加上金色燈具以及吊頂進行點睛，馬上就把我包圍在一種輕鬆優雅的度假氛圍裏；
整個接待過程，服務人員也是非常熱情，把我們從大廳引到電梯廳去43層check in；
我訂的是有海景視野的房間，進到房間內部，整個房間內也是白色與灰色的空間基調，走到窗邊，立馬會被廣闊的海平面以及蜿蜒的海岸線所吸引，心情會立馬被安靜的海平面安撫；
在居住過程中也有些小小的瑕疵，但是服務人員來處理的都很及時。比如説衞生間內藝術品上的射燈一直閃爍，我電話給了服務大使小李，很及時的給我們安排了電工師傅來維修，維修完還幫忙叫了阿姨來進行清理，真的很及時與貼心；還有就是房間功能規劃上，馬桶間稍微有點侷促，插座有點松需要來回轉換插頭方向才能插穩，其他使用都很舒適；
當然還有一些我很愛的地方，比如説好吃的唐閣，黑松露菌菇餃太好吃了，雖然我的咖啡灑了我一褲子，但是美味與優質的服務抵消了一切不適；
還有一處我的最愛：户外泳池！雖然小，但是水質很乾凈，也是面朝大海，旁邊有配置一個“戴花冠”的小吧枱，雖然小吧枱的功能好像已經閑置了，（有免費的礦泉水供應）但是玫紅色的熱帶小花➕藍色的水➕白色的地面🟰我想在這裏待下去，我是白天去遊的泳，人很少很清靜，晚上的話可能會更有氛圍；
有個小插曲是我游完泳回來還沒有到三點鐘退房時間，但是我回來的時候房門居然刷不開了，聯繫了服務枱，過了十分鐘左右才來幫我解決，不過whatever，整體住下來服務和居住體驗都很好，以上的小問題都可以忽略不計🥰
總之是一次很棒的出行居住體驗！！

msg:1.位置交通：
位於市中心，對面是萬綠園，很適合晨跑夜跑鍛鍊。
打車去各景點也方便。
去國際免税城酒店有接駁車，可以在前台掃小程序預約，乘坐2號線即可到達。朗廷是接駁車2號線的第二站，所以上車時候車上不少空位。
2.入住辦理：
晚上快9點到的，入住很快辦理，前台小姐姐還給了粉色玫瑰花。
3.房間：
中規中矩，比較喜歡燈光多，打開所有的燈屋子裡亮亮堂堂。不足的地方就是很多插頭不太穩，感覺有一點老。
4.早餐：
種類不多，中式西式基本的菜品。
5.健身房：
我最關心的模塊，健身中心房間不大，不對外，刷房卡才能進。跑步機衹有兩個，其中一個還是壞的。自由力量區空間小。有一個迷你龍門架還挺萌。

拍照打卡穿粉色衣服就對了！很搭！
WiFi有點慢
小插曲：前一天早晨和前台説了出發比較早預約早餐打包，但是第二天早晨並沒有準備打包早餐。衹能自己到機場又急匆匆的找早餐。。
海景房不如説是城市景觀+公園景觀房間。

msg:海南行的第一站海口，在網上看到很多好評所以選擇了朗廷，説實話是一家非常漂亮的商務酒店，服務非常熱情，泳池也漂亮，因為在海口衹是過渡兩晚，所以沒有拍啥酒店內的照片，我來談談我真實的住後感：如果為了打卡，真的衹是拍照好看，沒啥大必要～我是帶着娃來入住的，有些不方便，比如洗了衣服真沒地方曬，還有就是入住前前台給我打電話問我有啥需求，我説需要準備一些小童洗漱用品，結果到入住都沒準備😂酒店的早餐真的很一般般！品類不少，味道不好，唯一讓我看到不錯的是游泳池那邊的洗澡處有桑拿可以蒸😊這個比較舒服～總結説一下吧～如果和我一樣是過渡一下，可以選擇，停車方便，附近吃的多，但如果為了度假，可以選擇一些專業的度假酒店哦～

   43樓前台辦理入住感覺擺設顯冷清，缺少温度，能調整就最好了！
打掃房間的阿姨態度好，負責任，表揚！還有早餐時間的服務員普遍態度很好，熱情周到，到門口迎接，點贊！

六樓的無邊泳池，水深1.26米，池長25米，適中吧，看孩子方便。旁邊還有小小小童池，泳池都是付費的哦，30-80元檔次。

地理位置也不錯，過個馬路就是萬象城，吃喝買無障礙，商家再豐富點更好。六樓的自助餐廳早餐味道提升空間大，水果西點挺豐富的。

使用了攜程的延遲退房權益到兩點退房，完美避開海口中午的艷陽。

酒店位於國貿CBD區，很方便，出門萬像城，對面是萬綠園。
早餐豐富多樣，食材和烹飪水平一流。
夜晚，沿着萬綠園走着走着就能到雲洞，一路海風徐徐，很舒服放鬆。
設施和衞生:
酒店內部裝修新、保養好，房間也明亮整潔一塵不染，很有高級感。
服務:
讓我印象最深刻的就是酒店從上至下的微笑專業服務，從進大堂開始，一路上都有酒店人員熱情引導並微笑致意，及時地拿送行李或為我提前開門提供便利。早餐廳的服務人員也是專業有禮，服務到位。
晚上外出歸來後，發現已貼心地為我開了夜床並做了清潔，很用心。
此外，服務大使Julie也特別熱情貼心，真誠迅速地為我排憂解難，水平高有耐心，是個典型的優秀海南姑娘。

總之，海口朗廷酒店不僅是家硬件一流的豪華酒店，更是家軟件一流的人情味酒店，個人認為放在全國也是第一流的酒店，以後有機會我還會入住。

msg:要我説海口最好的酒店，同時也是景觀最好的酒店，莫過於海口朗廷。這家也是國內最朗廷的朗廷了，絕對能圓你的粉色純真公主夢。
.
本次入住朗廷主卧套房，標稱96平米，也是總套之下最好的房間，最大的亮點莫過於卧室過渡到陽台的獨特設計了，做了一個巧妙的，鏤空的，優雅的隔斷，穿過拱門就會發現萬綠園和世紀公園延伸出去的全海景展現在你的面前，單論海景的開闊程度，也要優於同在市區的威斯汀，希爾頓，索菲特和華邑，和朗廷的優雅嫻靜氣質非常搭調。
.
全屋裝修很下工本，非常素雅的歐式古典風格，不但超越了海口索菲特，即使和以奢華內裝著稱的佛山羅浮宮索菲特，也能平分秋色，整體是白色基調，清新淡雅，大量顏色均勻的白色大理石鋪陳又能體現奢華感，穿過門廊之後的圓廳更是能讓人“Wow”一下，這是在一些酒店總套級別才能見到的設計。
.
標準的套房配置兩個衞生間，客衞也挺寬敞，主衞空間雖然略有侷促但是不失奢華感，衞浴五金用的都是科勒的高端金色古典系列，這無疑是和白色最能互相襯託的顏色，同時在水晶燈的使用上也毫不吝惜，會讓人有身處瑞吉的感覺，然而足以把某靜安瑞吉秒掉。
.
主衞雙台盆，嵌入式浴缸挺舒適，淋浴體感中規中矩，備品用的朗廷專屬“川”系列，還是很好聞的舒緩氣息。主衞和客衞都沒用智能馬桶，這無所謂，其實對傳統歐式裝修來講，智能馬桶反而違和。
.
迷你吧的櫃子被放在了卧室裏，沉穩的深色木質調是白色主題的點綴，茶包用的TG，給的很足十來包，還有法壓壺和咖啡粉，並且在客廳裏放置了膠囊咖啡機。
.
這個房間最大的問題是沒有設計單獨的衣帽間，導致行李架衹有迷你吧旁邊一個摺疊式，這就使得行李展開之後，可能會少一些優雅感。
.
床品和床墊的舒適度都是相當高，不輸麗思瑞吉等頂奢。
.
客廳裏設定了就餐區，有個三人小餐桌，靠窗有貴妃榻可以舒適躺着觀景，這間其實是個角房，客廳和卧室的景觀不同，客廳能看到更多的市景而卧室是正海景。
.
入住會送一衹粉色嬌艷的玫瑰，都説朗廷是粉色的，不過房間卻幾乎是純白，或者玫瑰就是點睛之筆呢？
.
房間是相當漂亮，除了沒有獨立衣帽間，以及雙衞都是內衞之外，可以説各方面都令人滿意。非常值得體驗。
