msg:The housekeeper's service attitude was very good. I arrived late, but he came to the gate to pick me up and took me to the room. The housekeeper was very considerate and asked if I was hungry so that he could prepare instant noodles for me. The next day, there were green plants outside the window, which made people feel comfortable and healed. The environment was very quiet, and only birds could be heard. It is worth recommending. Everyone can come and experience it.

msg:I felt pretty good when I first arrived at the hotel. When I checked in, an older aunt at the front desk asked me to show my order number. After I showed it, I found my name in the registration book, so I said, "Isn't there one?" Then she said, "Yes, but I don't know which room to arrange for me." She asked me to wait for another staff member to send the guests to arrange for me. I was a little speechless. Then I checked in. I think although the check-in procedure was a bit unsmooth, the room was still good. The front desk girl who took us was also very polite and provided good service. Then something surprising happened to me. I have never encountered this in so many hotels. When I was ready to go to bed at night, the bed collapsed just after I lay down. It was really scary. The child was scared and ran to another room. I immediately contacted the housekeeper, who came as soon as he came. After seeing it, he also looked unbelievable. . . When they asked how many of us slept, this question was really speechless. They said that they would arrange for others to sleep upstairs, but it was late at night, so I refused. At night, I slept on the sofa downstairs in one movement until morning. My back and waist were sore. I felt that I was not here to travel but to suffer. When I checked out in the morning, I explained the situation of last night to the front desk, and the front desk also greeted me, but I was really unhappy! 
Let me talk about what I think is good. The environment is good, and the room is pretty good except for the bed. In addition, the service of the young lady at the front desk is also very good! She also took us to the room in the rain, which is worthy of praise.

Quiet and gentle are the words that suddenly jumped into my mind... Walking outside the courtyard, I saw the tea gardens all over the mountains, which made me feel relaxed and happy. I think this is the place I have been to in my dreams. I opened this single-family Chinese-style villa in the drizzle and felt that I had come to the real Jiangnan water town... Not only is the environment here good, but their young team of employees here also makes me feel that nature and man are one, and my mood is extremely comfortable. Next time I will bring my family here [Rose][Rose][Rose][Rose]

The butler service is super super good! He also helped us pick up and drop off at Zhezhe's concert for free! Each building here is a stand-alone building. Because it is a newly opened hotel, the facilities are very new and the breakfast is also very delicious! The butler in the hotel will also drive us to the door! Because we came back too late after watching the concert, the butler was worried that we were a little hungry, and specially held a bonfire party for us! The a**osphere is super good! Playing Azhe's songs and drinking wine! Thank you Nanshan Villa! Come again next time! Definitely come!

Surprises everywhere, from the hotel environment to the bonfire party arrangements.
Especially when checking out, because I overslept, it was past 2 pm and was delayed again and again. But the reply from the housekeeper to the staff was, "It's good to sleep comfortably."

This place is perfect for team building and meetings. The venue is large enough to hold many activities, and they are all single-family villas. Even if there are many people, it will not feel crowded at all. The environment is very good, especially in the evening, when the sun sets, the lights here are all on, which makes people feel calm. At night, walking and chatting with friends, sitting under the canopy, drinking some wine, and listening to some songs are really comfortable! If you don’t know where to gather with many people, you can really choose Nanshan Villa, you will never regret it!

msg:Facilities: Average, normal use

Hygiene: Those with obsessive-compulsive disorder can't stand it 🤦♀️, because in the mountains, there are small insects, big spiders, and many mosquitoes

Environment: The environment is OK, with a new Chinese style decoration style, but the layout is a bit strange. Although it is a suite, it would be better if there was a small door. The environment of the whole area is also good

Service: The service needs to be improved! 1. Let's start with driving into the park. On the first rainy day, I waited for 20+min at the gate before the door opened. On the second night, I learned from the lesson of the first day and agreed to open the door half an hour in advance. As a result, I waited for 20 minutes after I arrived. If the service cannot be improved, it is recommended to strengthen the hardware. 2. Breakfast: On the first day, I asked for breakfast to be delivered to the room at 10 o'clock (the breakfast was cold), and on the second day, I asked for it to be delivered to the room at 9 o'clock, but it was not delivered until 10 o'clock.
3. Here comes the point. I told the housekeeper that I would check out at 12:00 in advance, but at 11:30, the auntie came in by swiping her card (without knocking or saying hello). There were two girls in the room at the time, and I was so scared. If she had come in without clothes, the consequences would be disastrous!
It is not convenient to eat here, so remember to eat outside before coming back.
Let me talk about it a little bit. On the first day, because we had nothing to eat, the owner of the homestay bought us food and cooked chicken rice for us. I am very grateful!

My friend asked me if this is Alice in Wonderland

How could I have thought that Jinhua would have such a peaceful and beautiful B&B?

Our housekeeper, Sister Fang, is also attentive and responsive to every request.
Breakfast was delivered to the room by my aunt
considerate
Both hardware and software are better than five-star hotels.
It can even be said to be beyond

I feel like the price of this B&B will definitely increase in the future.

Cons: 1. No hotel service at all

2. The room where you check in is not the lobby, and it is full of sheets

3. After checking in, the first thing you see is the toiletries of other hotels, see the picture

4. No hand sanitizer and soap, the housekeeper said there was no more, use shower gel to wash your hands

5. The garbage is only changed after you call it every day, and I learned that the cleaning is outsourced by temporary workers

6. The breakfast is very poor

7. The hotel has no security, the door is completely opened and there is no access control, the hotel is located in a remote location, there are safety hazards

I don't know what the logic of Ctrip's star rating is, anyway, it's just a farmhouse with a newer decoration
