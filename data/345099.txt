msg:Great getaway. Narada is supposedly a reputable local brand with a long history - so trust them to know their thing. Resort facade can be a tad old with moulds at the corners. However, I am okay with that as I do not have direct contact with these surfaces. What's more important is that the towels and bedding are fresh and clean. I also appreciate a dehumidifier machine in my room - helped to remove excess water in the air. One downside though - the resort, being nestled in a rainforest, is full of mosquitos. So take note to pack lots of insect repellent - I was bitten incessantly, even while using the hotspring :(

msg:Staff was very nice, although the level of english  was close to 0 for most of employee at the reception, except big boss Mr Huang. But I repeat, all the staff was very nice and very helpful. The hotel asks for a 500RMB deposit ; when you leave the hotel, you must wait the ¬´¬†room check¬†¬ª to be sure that you didn‚Äôt drink a coke, a sprite, ate a tiny bag of chips or break anything. On these aspects, a cheap 120rmb/night hostel has better service than this five star hotel.

Otherwise the location is very nice, the private hot spring is very nice. Chinese restaurant is very good.

A great thank to the very nice and helpful staff.

msg:Location: hotel is located far from Sanya, in the middle of the Forest which is good for hiking to Qixian Mountain and also that gives you a totally different experience than the rest of places near Sanya. On the other hand it is quite far and it takes some time to get here by DiDi from Yalong bay. 

Hiking: The hotel staff helped us arrange the transportation to the Qixian Mountain entrance (40rmb both ways/per person). The driver was extremely friendly. Then we begin our hike which is quite challenging. It takes around 4 hours for the whole trip. On the top you can climb by using chains which is cool.

Hot springs: Hotel has a few hot springs which are pleasant to enjoy but quite small and also in the evening the guard took the water away from the hot spring at 7pmüòÖ

Swimming pool: swimming pool with the palm tree is absolutely amazing and great for taking pictures.

Restaurant: near lobby there is one restaurant that serves Chinese cuisine but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it. We waited for so long for a few dishes and the staff felt so uncomfortable dealing with foreigners. 

The other restaurant 7/5 is much better. We had a nice lunch there. 

In general we enjoyed our stay here but we were a little disappointed with the hotel‚Äôs amenities which were old. Everything looks much better in the photos than in real life. 
I‚Äôm not sure if I would recommend this place.

The breakfast and evening buffets were excellent with great western options. There are several fantastic pools but none are heated, however there are many smaller hot spring pools to choose from.

msg:We loved our stay at the Narada. Price to experience is really good. Very luxe amenities. 

Amenities: The main pool is as amazing as it looks in photos (more like two pools) and there are two more that are nearby hot spring pools. Well landscaped, super nice. 

Cleanliness: Rooms are very clean as is the property. The only issue are the public bathrooms esp by the main pool. A bit gross, easy fix! 

Service: A little slow on the check-in but the staff is super friendly and helpful. Very fast to get the little cars around the property or room service when needed. 

Rooms: Very comfortable beds, great shower, the bathtub on the balcony is epic. It comes with a bag of herbs for soaking. One downside is very loud plumbing, but it's in the rainforest so... There are comfy robes, sweaters (it gets a bit chilly at night), and umbrellas in the room. Recommend adding some lotion to the toiletries as there is a lot of time spent in water. 

Transportation: We took a bus (#1 intercity bus) from Sanya. For some reason no one at the hotel knows about it, but it's quite convenient and about 10 times cheaper than a didi. 

Food: breakfast had a great spread, mostly Chinese, very fresh and tasty. There is a buffet for dinner, we didn't try it as I'm not a fan, but it's reasonably priced. There is also a Chinese restaurant and room service with simple (and very affordable) dishes. No western options, so might be a drawback for some.

It was all Chinese food at the western restaurant. We thought the dinner buffet was a good price, but chose not to eat it every night. The breakfast and dinner food were very similar.  Room service was an affordable option. My family of 3 could eat dinner for less than 125RMB. 

The breakfast and dinner are served in the same place. It's quite beautiful with the lush greenery surrounding the space. 

The pool was exactly as shown in the picture, clean and beautiful. Loved it. 

We spent 5 nights there but felt 3 would have been enough for us. It's really beautiful, but it is remote with not many options for eating around. 

A beautiful, peaceful environment.

The location of the hotel is stunning. The Zen vibes of being on top of a mountain is so relaxing. 
Unfortunately, it is NOT well maintained...it's a bit dingy for a five star hotel.
It's a massive area, so I kind of understand.
But, I hope, that efforts will be made to better maintain the hotel. 

THE ROOM: 4/5
Needs a little work. There are details that should be fixed. But, other than that, it is nice and comfortable. 

THE STAFF: 5/5
They are delightful!
Many thanks to Ms. Xiao Fang, for the assistance, even before we arrived at the hotel. 
Also, big thanks to Mr. Huang for being so patient and understanding, even though we can't speak chinese. 
...the trainee, Miss Rain, very nice and friendly and every one else at the restaurant. 

Every staff is very accommodating. 
They made our holiday wonderful and convenient. 
This hotel is very lucky to have these hard working people.

msg:Lovely retreat in the hidden jungles. Service is really kind and people want to help you. Like in other Narada, you have to pay even for water at the pool area and you can‚Äôt order anything to eat there. 

In the map it says that the hotel has 3 swimming pools. However, only the main pool was in use. You can keep it to yourself pretty much during the daytime, but after the hottest time around 4-5 pm, Chinese guests take over the pool.

Breakfast was good and there was enough choices for everyone. You can also have a proper meal at any time in the 5/7 restaurant. 

The jungle paths are nice, surrounding is really lush and green. There‚Äôs also a really good restaurant just a walking distance away from the resort.

msg:We booked this resort knowing it would be out of the crowded tourist area and in a more relaxed and natural setting. The location and property did not disappoint! The resort grounds seem to be carved right out of the forest and the entire facility is immaculately maintained. Although there are electric carts to shuttle you around the property, we enjoyed walking from our villa to the pool and restaurant so we could enjoy the scenery and smells of all the natural surroundings.  The overall look of the resort is stunning. 

The service from the entire resort staff was top notch, and we very much appreciated Mr. Wang's (front desk)
 and Eden's (restaurant) attentiveness and courtesy throughout our stay. From the cleaning staff to the grounds keepers, each staff member greated us with a smile and offered their assistance at every chance.  

The spacious room was very clean and well equipped for our stay.  The large hot spring tub on the balcony was a luxurious treat. Our only complaint about the room was the outdated and poor quality of the television which did not match the standard of the rest of the room.

Although 2 of the hotel's 3 pools were out of service for our 5-day stay (which we did not get an explanation for) , the double-tiered infinity pool was top class.  The water was warm and the view was stunning!  The pictures on the hotel advertisement are accurate and lounging at this pool was worth the trip alone.

The restaurant served a good-quality buffet for both breakfast and dinner. The variety never really changed throughout our stay, and with the lack of dining options nearby it became somewhat boring after a few days. There appears to be an outdoor BBQ during peak season, so that probably helps the dining experience if you are staying during that time.  That being said, the service was great and the food was always fresh each meal of our stay.

2 other points to note are 1) the hotel is about a 300rmb Didi ride from Sanya Airport and 2)there is a very scenic and lengthy hike on Mount Qingxian within a 5-minute shuttle from the resort lobby. The desk can arrange transport for you. 

Overall, we would be more than happy to return to this resort on our next visit to Hainan, and we would highly recommend this spot to anyone looking for a relaxed vibe and/or scenic option instead of a busier seaside beach resort.

Felt like this was their first day managing the hotel. We waited 2 hours to finally get our room which wasn‚Äôt ready when we arrive despite saying on the app that we would arrive at 3pm (we arrived at 3:30pm).
We had to waiting for this long in the lobby with no AC and our daughter who is 1 year old only, she was sweating so much and we didn‚Äôt have any water, no place to seat. 
Staff kept on lying to us, telling they would arrange a room in 10min but then 10 minutes later they said 10min again and again. They told they brought the manager each time but it was reallly their colleague so the ‚Äúmanager‚Äù couldn‚Äôt take responsibility and upgrade us either for example. They did this 3 times in a row ! 
I have never been through a worse experience than this in a hotel, it really damaged our stay and was stressful.
Staff need a lot of training. Rooms need to be ready in time, appropriate solutions needs to be found in the event the right room is not ready.

The room was ok. Pools are a bit old but still ok. The main pool is beautiful. Buffet is not great either and expensive.

Villas are sprawled across the large complex and you feel like you‚Äôre in a modern treehouse. Shuttle carts are always available end zooming around to give you a lift but it is easily walkable too if you prefer to walk. The food was surprisingly good! The best breakfast and dinner buffets I‚Äôve had in my two week stay in Hainan and for a great price. 

The only odd thing is the price of additional water bottles but you can easily get cheaper ones right outside the complex. They also offer all juices and soda for free with meal or hot water if you prefer. 

Hotel made easy arrangements for us to hike Qixianling. The town organized it quite well where the mountain offers shuttles for hotel pick-up/drop-off for 20rmb per person one-way. The hike itself is the perfect way to spend your day. Absolutely beautiful views on top and a bit of a thrill. 

The pools, especially the two-tiered infinity one was the perfect place yo relax at the end of each day. Each room also has their own hot  tub outside on the balcony. 

Hotel also helped us arrange transportation onward to Haikou which was helpful. While it was possible to call a Didi to bring us to Qixianling, it was impossible to get one leaving. 

Highly recommend!

msg:This time, my friend who was on honeymoon in Haikou specially recommended this hot spring hotel. We felt very good after staying for a few days. The hotel is very clean. There are about five small hot spring pools, and there is a large swimming pool next to it. There is also a mirror swimming pool in the hotel. There are not many people every time we go there, so we can soak slowly and happily.
Breakfast is divided into outdoor and indoor. The environment is good and the food is delicious. The outdoor one is not hot, and you can see the jackfruit tree. There is also a children's playground with some rabbits and chickens and ducks. If you have children, you can go and have a look. There is basically no smell. Seeing that the hotel has projects, we decided to experience pond fishing and catching crabs by the stream. It is very cheap. Each project can basically be played for about an hour. The beauty who took us is very decisive and capable, but also very considerate. She will protect our safety and introduce us to rainforest plants and small animals. I would like to say that the service of this hotel is quite good. You can call a tour bus to pick you up at any time to play in it. It will come in 2-3 minutes. Zou Botao, the service staff at the lobby front desk, is very good, very careful and gentle. Also, the front office manager Zhu Zhongna was very considerate. He knew that we wanted to go to the Forest Park and told us a lot of things we needed to pay attention to and the above situations. He was very good. I had a great time chatting with him and I will come back to play again!

They helped adjust the dehumidifier and air conditioner in the room. We had the hotel's specialty coconut chicken hot pot for lunch. There were many kinds of vegetables, and the coconut chicken was sweet and delicious. Of course, the hot springs were the purpose of this trip. The hot spring soup in the room was at a suitable temperature, private and comfortable. What surprised me was the search at 4:30 in the afternoon. For the first time, I saw crabs living in tree holes, a century-old fig tree, and felt the customs of the Li people. Thanks to the tour guide Huang Jinfei for her wonderful explanation along the way. In the evening, I experienced the outdoor hot springs under the starry sky to eliminate the fatigue of the day. It was a wonderful day spent in Junlan.

msg:We stayed in a mountain villa with its own hot spring pool. We went there before May Day, so there weren't many people. If you're going to the rainforest, I recommend it!
Advantages: The hotel service is very enthusiastic. You need to call the shuttle bus to go up and down the mountain, and the pick-up is very fast. The hotel's public hot spring pool is in the jungle, the environment is very good, and the infinity pool is also very good. The lobby restaurant and in-room dining are both delicious. There is a self-service KTV in the lobby (a big plus). The room facilities are OK, very clean, and the air conditioning is very powerful.
Disadvantages: The breakfast content is limited, and the outdoor breakfast attracts insects. The hot spring pool in the room is dirty, and occasionally insects run in. After asking the front desk to clean it, it still didn't feel clean, so I didn't soak in it. It is recommended not to book a room with a hot spring pool. In addition, the balcony of the villa faces the jungle and has no view

msg:Today's travel sharing cannot only talk about the good places in Hainan... There are really some places that are not fun and need to be avoided...

Baoting, Qixianling, Hainan Hot Spring... I will never come again...

Baoting's five-star hotel is just a photo scam. The room is very ordinary and the service is rustic... Once the hotel starts selling various restaurants, spas, and gifts in the room... it looks very low... The hotel is also suitable for the standard of cheap tour groups. The breakfast is very ordinary, for example, it is not included. Objectively speaking, the room is only worth 400

Baoting's Qixianling Scenic Area is the worst scenic spot in my 20-year self-guided travel career. The infrastructure is not up to par, the safety is low, and the toilets are all without water. After the first ticket, there are four or five tickets waiting... It gives people the feeling: it's a bit ugly. How can such a scenic spot be rated 4A... By the way, there are poisonous snakes on the handrails on the way down the mountain... The most ugly scenic spot

The two-day trip to Baoting makes it difficult for people to have a good impression of this place, just like a Just like I can't figure out what's fun in Wanning, every time I go to Wanning, I have an urge to return home quickly... This time, Baoting's negative impression score finally surpassed Wanning... Even if I'm tired and hungry, I don't want to eat in the various nearby farmhouses there, and I don't want to use the toilets that often have no water...

Traveling and living, you have to go to mature places... Famous places (only Sanya and Lingshui in Hainan are warm in winter and cool in summer, and livable). The less mature the place, the more likely you are to step on thunder... People who are afraid of tiredness, people with mysophobia, and people who don't want to travel and suffer, should avoid Baoting.

If you feel tired after traveling to a place, it seems to be because of backwardness and routine... From a metaphysical point of view, it means that the energy of this place is average...

Also in Hainan's tropical rainforest and mountain climbing, the energy of Lingshui Diaoluo Mountain is very good, it is very refreshing and nourishing, Qionghai's Baishiling is also very good... And Baoting's Qixianling consumes energy...

For reference for friends who plan to travel

The only regret is that I didn't ask the names of the front desk lady and concierge guy who checked us in at the beginning. I wanted to write them good reviews, but I never had the chance. The breakfast at Narada Hotel is great, the environment is great, and the food served is also very delicious. I will go there next time and choose to stay in the Rainforest Villa! Super satisfied ~

msg:Environment: The environment is beyond doubt. It is in the forest park, a natural oxygen bar. The hotel introduction says that there is no boiler because it is not needed. The hot spring water here is enough! A particularly domineering declaration! So here, you can see wildly growing jackfruits, figs and various vegetation; there will also be geckos and fireflies occasionally visiting the balcony!
Facilities: For me who is not obsessed with cleanliness, "old" and "mold spots" are nothing! But I really can't understand why there is no air conditioning in the check-in lobby!
Service: The place is very large. It is a bit tiring to walk without calling a car. It is very convenient to call a car
Food: Dinner and breakfast are all self-service in the 75 restaurant; the highlight of the dinner of about 130 is the small hot pot (it is said that two people have one pot). It looks good in photos, but the ingredients are so-so! The video of the employee who promoted the dinner is very good, and he swears that the ingredients are all there. In fact, it is not so rich. The baby is completely attracted by the ice cream. A decent five-star restaurant for breakfast, enough to eat, but the early bird catches the worm, and you have to queue up for dinner on holidays!

Private hot spring on the balcony: The hot spring in the room is the hotel's selling point! We like it! The public hot spring is crowded and not very clean, so just soak in your room! The Internet celebrity swimming pool is just like that, you can go or not

Parent-child activities: making wreaths is free, other charges are charged; at 16:00, a Li ethnic minority aunt will take you on a hiking trip to explore the forest, introducing vegetation along the way, which is good, but not suitable for little kids who don't understand

msg:Room: It's quite satisfactory. It's a bit old, but it's well maintained. The room on the first floor we stayed on had a bit of a musty smell, but that's understandable in the rainforest. All in all, the room was okay.
Catering: Compared to in-room dining, it seems average because breakfast is all outdoors, so there are many mosquitoes. The dishes have no special features. There are many mosquitoes near the uncooked noodles. It seems not so hygienic. This may be because there is basically nothing to eat in the outdoor desserts and snacks. Overall it was a bit messy and the dining experience was average
Environment: The overall environment is impeccable. The hot springs are also very good. Not only do they come with the rooms, but there are also large pools for guests to use. There are walking trails in the hotel. It is beautiful to live in the rainforest and take a walk.
Service: The overall service is orderly. The front desk may not have enough staff. The two girls have to entertain guests and answer the phone. Maybe they are too busy. When I asked about the hotel facilities and activities, the reply was rather perfunctory and I went to answer the phone. Maybe the staff is tight and the workload is tight. It‚Äôs understandable even if you‚Äôre older
The room service was very good. I met the room attendant when I was walking and asked for matches. I looked for them in the car and quickly went to the studio to get a box and delivered it to me. It was very timely and I was very touched.
Generally speaking, the accommodation is recommended, the food and beverages are average, and it is recommended if you are staying for a short stay of one or two days.
PS: Wen Cong is not an ordinary person, but the rooms provide Fengyoujing mosquito repellent and other items. I have seen many guests commenting on mosquito bites and other problems. In fact, if you want to live in the rainforest, you must accept the fact that pests can only be driven away from the hotel. It has been done very well and there is no way to eliminate it, so I want to soak in the hot springs and enjoy the beautiful scenery of the rainforest without being bitten by mosquitoes. This is impossible, so I sympathize with the bad reviews of the hotel.

Great! Especially promote parent-child activities. Huang Jinfei, the guide of the Li ethnic group, introduced some vegetation, flowering period and folk culture in the forest in detail. The children listened very carefully. They felt that these ethnic cultural knowledge and the cognition of nature could be promoted more. The children also experienced rubber tapping and grinding soy milk with their children. They praised it very much. They also enjoyed breakfast under jackfruit.

The front desk manager Ma Xiangxiang solved the problem for us properly, followed up and helped us in every possible way. The hotel is built in a tropical rainforest landscape environment with very good ecology. In addition, the cultural activities set up by the hotel are very meaningful and valuable. It is worth recalling to experience the cultural traditions and customs of the Li people. Thanks again to Sister Huang Huang for taking us to explore the rainforest, and Sister Mei for taking us to experience the medicinal fragrance culture of the Li ethnic group. Will definitely come again next time.

There are many soaking pools and infinity swimming pools in the front yard, but I didn‚Äôt enjoy them. Not far from our room, there is a small soaking pool with original soup, green tea and Chinese medicine pool. The Chinese medicine pool has the highest temperature. Walking along one pool after another, you will feel It's much more comfortable. For me, the green tea temperature is the most suitable. I just like the Chinese medicine pool and force it through, so the effect is lacking.
The park is very large, with various tropical plants, as well as free activities and paid items. Due to time constraints, I didn‚Äôt participate in them, but it should feel good. There is also a small bubble pool at the door. I tried it and it was very good. The main temperature is completely adjustable by yourself.
The room is a bit damp, and the Hainan mosquitoes are too enthusiastic and take good care of outsiders. In fact, we don't want them to be so enthusiastic. This is a bit üò£
I like the environment here. If you are getting together with friends, this is a very good choice.

I booked rooms at both hotels this time because of their high ratings on Ctrip, but I was a little disappointed. It was raining and the temperature was not high. The hot spring water was not hot, and the swimming pool was full of mosquitoes, which soon crawled all over the floor; there were bugs on the floor of the shower room in the room, the facilities were old, and the management was average. The breakfast and the free coconut chicken hot pot were good.

Service: The most praiseworthy thing is the service. The car pick-up and drop-off is very convenient.
Facilities: This is a good hotel for hot spring bathing in Baoting.
This place is great for bringing children to play. ÔøºAfter the fifteenth day of the first ***** month, the price is very suitable. There are both indoor and outdoor hot springs, and there are many guests from Beijing and the three northeastern provinces. ÔøºWhen soaking in hot springs outdoors, be careful to prevent mosquitoes. Special reminder: The hotel's service is very good, but you must pay attention to the front desk. The cost of communication is very high. Ôøº‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be afraid of bothering customers, everything is centered on selling the house‚ÄùÔøºThis is my biggest feeling about the hotel front desk. ÔøºÔøºOur stay was relatively comfortable and we extended our stay for another day. I couldn't find the same model online, so I had to place an order for another room type. The difference was dozens of dollars.
. ÔøºBut the hotel front desk firmly disagreed with the original price of the original room. ÔøºEven if you stay for one more day, you will have to move to the next room. Carrying luggage up and down the stairs. Ôøº
I shared a room with a friend and wanted to check out at 2:00 pm. I applied to the front desk and said I disagreed. I insisted on checking out at 12:30. Why should I apply to the management? After a few minutes of calling, another staff member agreed. ÔøºIt's not the peak season when we come, Ôøºbut the front desk is not afraid of trouble for guests and only cares about their own convenience, which leaves a very bad impression.

Finally, there are a few shortcomings. The three swimming pools, the Internet celebrity infinity pool and the other one were not open on the first day I went there. I asked the staff and they said they would not open if there were not many people. So there are several outdoor swimming pools and hot springs, but everyone Be prepared that the hotel will not be open when there are not many people.

msg:I stayed at this hotel 14 years ago and had a very good impression. This time I checked in, the environment was still beautiful. In the rainforest, the room felt simple and the hygiene was acceptable. The master who drives the battery car, the security guard, and the cleaners are all very good. The weirdest thing is the front desk. When I arrived at the hotel, I was not asked what room the hotel had arranged for me. Instead, they asked me what room I had booked. They said they were afraid that they had the same name. I told them to check my phone number and the front desk said they couldn't find it. Then I was told that the road would be closed for a government-organized event tomorrow morning from 7:30 to 12:30. I asked the hotel if breakfast could be made half an hour earlier. I could leave after eating, but the answer was no. I went to have breakfast this morning and was told that breakfast would start earlier at 7 o'clock. I was wondering why they didn't inform me. I asked the front desk if the activity was over at 9:30, and they told me that they would notify me if it was over. I didn‚Äôt receive the notification at 11:30, so I wanted to miss the check-out time, so I called the front desk. They were told that the activity had ended early. I was really speechless. . When checking out, the room card was handed over to the front desk. After waiting for a long time, I asked if I could leave. I said wait a moment. I would ask again later if I was finished. I just didn't answer. I asked if you were satisfied with your stay. I haven't been allowed to leave yet. He said he wanted to give me a souvenir, but I was so angry that he immediately refused and turned away. I think souvenirs are not a must, but providing decent service and not answering questions that are inappropriate is a must. The experience of staying here this time was not very good, and it was directly attributed to the Narada brand. Anyway, I will never come here again.

This time we stayed in Xigu for two nights. When we were walking, we saw the elegant and quiet environment in the villa area. We wanted to stay in the villa area for one night. We happened to meet this Mr. Huang. He was very enthusiastic and helped us get in touch. All matters including house viewing and subsequent booking were arranged clearly for us.

msg:If you bring a dog to stay, all aspects of the hotel's environmental facilities are OK, but I would like to objectively talk about my own feelings about pet-friendliness to provide some reference for other people who stay with pets:
1. After check-in, furry children can enter and leave the lobby, but they immediately have to sign an agreement that pets are not allowed to enter or exit various other places in the hotel, including restaurants, so I didn't go for breakfast and kept ordering room service. The hotel is located in a remote location and there are no takeaways available. Ordering food in the room is the best option. It is not expensive. A meal costs 70 or 80 and you still have to throw away half of it.
Suggestion: Since it is already pet-friendly, can we open a few outdoor tables in the restaurant for guests with pets?

2. We flew all the way to Hainan for vacation with our furry child. It must be a well-tamed pet with good behavioral habits, and it is even more impossible to leave it without a leash (I am afraid that it will be lost in a different place if it is not on a leash). I was walking my dog ‚Äã‚Äãon a leash in front of the villa in the early morning. The cleaning lady who was sweeping the floor five meters away from the door looked away and said she was scared. She originally wanted to stay for five nights, but I hurried away when I saw this.
Suggestion: Can pet-friendly hotels clarify how they want to make guests feel when training their staff? We don‚Äôt fly all the way here just to be disliked. If not holding a leash would pose a threat to the safety of others, you are welcome to report it, but this inexplicable fear comes unexpectedly.

3. Dogs can board the hotel shuttle bus at will, which is very convenient. The concierge service at the door is also very good. This is a hotel that is very suitable for a health vacation while driving. There are also some activities for children, which are also suitable for parents and children.

As for pet-friendliness, I hope it is truly friendly, rather than making pet-friendly money and constraining families with pets.

There are many crabs, and children can experience the fun of catching crabs in the wild. In short, it is worth a visit.

The artistic conception, the room terrace has a private hot spring, you can soak at any time! I told the receptionist at the front desk to disinfect the hot spring pool. Not long after I checked in, service staff came to help with disinfection. Both the receptionist and the receptionist at the front desk and lobby provided good service. There are many mosquitoes in the mountains, so the hotel provides mosquito repellent and wind oil essence. Due to the rush of time this time, I arrived at the hotel late. I booked a package and did not experience some of the activities. The front desk helped me delay check-out, made reservations for activities before departure, and gave me a small gift. But the hotel facilities are a bit old, especially the software kettle. It would be better to replace it. Overall, the living experience this time was very good. I will have the opportunity to stay a few more days next time.

However, since I don‚Äôt like buffets, I would like to express my personal opinion. If you order a la carte, the quality of the dishes is still okay. It is not much different from before. The rooms are old and not clean. The shower in the room I checked in for the first time was still broken, and I was too lazy to replace it. The waiters in the restaurant were pretty good, but the female waiter at the front desk was worse. I don‚Äôt know if she was in a bad mood or something, but her attitude was quite bad, which was impressive. Overall, looking at personal needs, this place is good for those who value scenic views, recreation and hot springs.

First of all, the service is really great. The front desk was very enthusiastic about checking in and introducing the hotel's facilities. Coconuts and desserts were given as a gift upon check-in, and then the staff took battery cars to various places. After asking, they are on duty 24 hours a day to provide battery car pick-up and drop-off service. It‚Äôs so hard work!

The staff at the hot spring and swimming pool are also great. They provide tea and bath towels. The swimming pool also has water guns and swimming rings, which is really good hahaha.

In particular, my family member had a sprained ankle, and the staff was very considerate and proactively provided safflower oil and Yunnan Baiyao. Thank you very much.

Secondly, the quality of Narada's hotels is really good, and they are really good at selecting locations. The hot spring resources in Baoting are great. The skin you soak in is so white and tender that mosquitoes make your feet slippery (the amazing thing is that you don‚Äôt seem to see too many mosquitoes in the hotel)

There is nothing to say about the swimming pool of Junlan in Baoting. The infinity mirrored swimming pool is so beautiful and surrounded by rainforest plants. The environment makes people want to cry!

There is also a fish spa pool next to the hot spring. It is very clean and has no smell. The little fish in it will clean your skin. It feels quite magical.

Then the room is also very clean and tidy, and the private hot spring bath is awesome! The balcony is also very large and you can rest against the woods. There is also a humidifier in the room, and I also like the white tea scented shower gel provided.

In the end, the food was quite good. There seemed to be many farmhouses nearby, but we chose the hotel restaurant, which was very good! The set menu is rich and much more delicious than outside! (I found a restaurant in Wuzhishan based on a certain review and it was hard to explain) The breakfast buffet is also very rich, and it can be used as brunch for two mealsüòÅ

The bedding and bath towels are very comfortable. The taste of the bath products is very high-end. I will order food delivered to the room in the evening and will not return it. The baby ox, braised five-legged pig, and coconut rice are all delicious. Walking in the park in the morning is very comfortable. I feel like I have to take deep breaths to avoid wasting the high-concentration negative oxygen ions surrounding me. They are also given as a gift when I check out. I got souvenirs, and I have to say that the management is very good, and they are always good every time I come.

There are more roads leading to Narada Hotel, which is more convenient. The environment of the hotel is still very good , The original vegetation trees are all over the hotel, providing a huge natural oxygen bar for the hotel guests, the balcony of the valley room has a hot spring pool, which is very convenient. The hotel is unique and can be called a classic online celebrity check-in point. Although the hotel area is large, there is no inconvenience because there is a battery shuttle bus available at any time. In addition, the humanization of the hotel service is very good. I didn‚Äôt even think of the members of the same company having a birthday, but the hotel customer service observed carefully. The birthday cake was sent on that day, which was touching. , The courtesy is light and the affection is heavy. I am very grateful to the service staff of Narada Hotel. Thank you. I will still use Narada as the first choice for accommodation when I come to Baoting in the future.

msg:Definitely the highlight of this trip! Liked more than expected!
The hotel is located in the Qixianling rainforest area, the location is neither high nor low, just perfectly wrapped in the depths of the rainforest.
The hotel was built earlier and it is indeed old, and the facilities are aging, but it is very clean, and the service is excellent. The refrigerator and dehumidifier were replaced immediately due to usage problems.
The breakfast is very rich, and the dinner was eaten at the hotel's own Taoyuan restaurant for two days. It was a bit surprising that every dish was delicious üòã.
The environment in the rainforest area where the hotel is located is very good, the negative oxygen ions are extremely high, and it is very refreshing to take a walk in the morning and evening.
Lan Tingting at the front desk was very enthusiastic about her service. Before she left, she gave partridge tea as well. The invoice was issued in a timely manner, and the experience was very good.
In addition, the hotel's free "Looking for Yaya" Li nationality guide Mei Juhua spoke very well, and learned a lot about rainforest ecology, vegetation, Li nationality survival, lifestyle and some cultural customs~

The hotel environment is definitely the ceiling of the same price, living in the tropical rainforest, soaking in natural hot springs, eating local fruits, breathing extremely fresh air, and having cute little squirrels as companions. The most important thing is that it is obviously a rainforest, and the insect control in the room is excellent. After staying for five days, no insects were found in the room.
The hotel‚Äôs activities are really very attentive. They strongly promote the Li nationality‚Äôs incense making and paya tracking. They thought it was just a handicraft activity, but they were moved by the culture told by the sister of the Li nationality. The sister of the Li nationality who took me is called Huang Jinfei. You can ask her out!
The staff I met in the hotel were very kind and enthusiastic. The lobby manager Wang Xiaoshuai was named, she is kind-hearted, patient and thoughtful, thank you to her!
It‚Äôs rare to write such a long review, but the experience is really good. It‚Äôs different from the previous experience of staying in a hotel. If I have a chance, I‚Äôd like to stay again

The room is close to the mirrored swimming pool. If you want to swim, you can walk there. It's very convenient and you don't need to call a car. The cafeteria for breakfast is my favorite. The environment is very good, and it looks good in any photo! When checking out, Ms. Zhu Tingjuan, the manager of the lobby, came here to give a souvenir.

msg:The hotel has a beautiful environment, a large area, and the distribution of villa rooms is well arranged. This time we were arranged in the innermost part of the villa area, next to a betel nut forest, and it felt quite good.
The hotel's private car is parked in a special parking lot outside the residential area. To get to the room, you need to take the sightseeing car inside the hotel. However, the sightseeing car is very convenient, on call, and the relevant personnel are also very proactive.
The hotel facilities are complete, and the hot spring in the private soup pool is also good. However, some facilities are a bit old and damaged, and need to be repaired in time.
The breakfast in the hotel is good, with rich varieties and good taste. Overall this hotel is worth recommending.

Facilities: Relatively old, the sofa and chairs look dirty, the bed makes strange noises, and the shower facilities are full of rust.
Hygiene: I went for the infinity pool. The hygiene of the pool was terrible...it looked like the water hadn't been changed in a year...
Environment: In the room I stayed in, there were a lot of frogs croaking at night. The soundproofing of the room was so bad that I thought the frogs were in the room. I couldn't sleep for two nights. During the day, the frogs stopped and I fell asleep. It was really a waste of money. Suffer.
Service: Finally, let‚Äôs talk about the service. The service of the hotel staff is good. There is a battery car to pick up and drop off wherever you go. There is also a meal delivery in the middle of the night. Although the meal is very average, the only breakfast is very rich.

The only problem is that the refrigerator does not cool. There is a need for a shuttle bus to pick up and drop off in the hotel. There are indeed many mosquitoes in the mountain environment, which is understandable. The manager Zhu Juanting's service is very good, and the overall service of the hotel is still acceptable. The ingredients in the restaurant are fresh and taste good. The swimming pool is great, the hot spring is a bit hot, it is a bit hot in the 35¬∞C weather, but I will stay again next time!

The two swimming pools are also very beautiful. The double-layer mirror swimming pool has a sense of design. Every room has a hot spring, which is suitable for all ages and is very suitable for vacation. The shuttle bus is on call, the consumption in the hotel is not high, and the price/performance ratio is very good. It may be because relatively few tourists come to Qixianling, so it feels very quiet.

The hot spring is also very comfortable, and the staff I met in the hotel, including the eldest sister in the restaurant, are very polite. Especially the restaurant of the hotel, the family said that they ate it for 3 days, it was delicious, stone fish, Wuzhishan wild vegetables, etc., were very good. There are many options for breakfast, but the heat preservation effect is poor, and the food is cold. Let me make a small suggestion. I suggest that the hotel prepare some oin**ent for mosquito bites in case guests need it. After all, in the tropical rainforest, my family and I have a lot of red bumps. After we came out, we diagnosed that it was bitten by betel nut insects, because the hotel only has wind Olein, no good therapeutic effect. Next time we have a chance, we will come again and linger.

Thanks to the lobby manager Wang Xiaoshuai. Our car was parked for 2 days. Because of the rain, it was covered with ants. When there were many mosquitoes in one room, we were given a room change. I haven't been here for three years, and the service has improved a lot, but next time, I have to choose to come in winter. This season, it's too hot.

msg:Service: The service is really nothing to say, the hotel with the best service in Hainan these few days, and my elder brother took the initiative to take us around the hotel to introduce plants, the experience is so good! ! We live in Building No. 8. The location is very close to the restaurant and the lobby. The balcony on the first floor is the infinity pool. There is also an open space to stroll casually. Everyone takes pictures on the second floor of the swimming pool, so the privacy on the first floor is very good. , It is recommended for young couples, couples choose~ The hotel has its own small tram, you can just call a car wherever you go, in fact, it is not far away, if time and energy permit, it is recommended to take a stroll, you can see many interesting things and scenery

Environment: A hotel surrounded by tropical plants! ! As a northerner, I am so happy that I can see fireflies at night! ! The hotel itself has mango, banana, and jackfruit trees. It's a pity that these fruits are not included in the breakfast fruits. Besides, there are quite a variety of breakfast types, which are definitely enough. Qixianling National Forest Park is just behind the hotel, and there is a special car to pick it up. It is really exhausting to climb to the top. It is recommended to go on the first day. It is quite fun, and you can go climbing if you have nothing to do.

Facilities and sanitation: The facilities are not new, but they are relatively clean. Although the swimming pool is just outside the door, and it is also in the big forest, the room is not very humid. The clothes washed with the air conditioner on can basically be dried the next day. The craze hahaha.

Next time I come to Hainan, if I don‚Äôt want to experience a new hotel, I will still choose this hotel~

msg:First of all, it was very late at night, and I wanted to make a good review with the feeling of being unable to fall asleep. I seldom comment like this, so I took advantage of this moment. I got home at 4:00 in the morning because of a four-hour flight delay. I went to work in a few hours, and I really couldn‚Äôt make a comment in time. Everything I ordered on Ctrip this time is unbelievable. I won‚Äôt elaborate on the problem of cockroaches in the previous few accommodations. Now let‚Äôs get to the point and talk about Narada. It's not the first time I've lived here. Obviously, the sanitation facilities are not as good as before. In such a humid environment in Hainan, it's impossible to keep the room dry and there's a musty smell, but at least the room is free from mosquitoes, right? What is the price of 1,800 a night to measure? Is it your reputation or your environment? (Although the house price is not that high this time, the last time I stayed was 998 for one night). When I entered the lobby, there was a gecko lying on the pillar, and various mosquitoes flying around the lamp. I can understand the outdoors in Hainan. Before entering the room, two geckos were lying on the door frame. I didn‚Äôt care. When I pushed the door, I met a black pilot who flew directly to the fan blades and pretended to be dead. The private soup outside the balcony was untouched. How about being surrounded by big trees? Soggy? Hurry up to close the balcony door and bring in two flying insects. I used to have a soup bag to make do with it, but now I don‚Äôt prepare anything. Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt take a single photo of the old facilities in the room, including the flying insects and insects I saw. Aviator, at that time I called the front desk and asked to change the room. The front desk said to ask the staff to see if it can drive away the bugs. I want to say, how can we live if you spray the medicine? Simply cancel the room change, it is estimated that it will be the same everywhere, the small black dots in the picture can be seen in the handbag I just put down, and a small spider came to spin a web within a few minutes, because the background reference object is too large, the small spider The photos are not clear. Let‚Äôs talk about the hot springs. The water level is obviously for soaking your feet. There are a total of 74 packs, counting them while applying the medicine, even the packs are already swollen, so I ask you whether Narada Sanitizer is in place? At least the entertainment public area should not be as natural as the woods on the side of the road, right? Besides waiting for the battery car, there are very few customers in the morning. I waited for ten minutes on the side of the road without a car to pick me up, and I didn't take my mobile phone. I walked all the way to the lobby. Do I still want to be bitten by mosquitoes? The front desk is also generous. They sent a piece of fruit and two coconuts to make amends. Nowadays, people really don‚Äôt need anything. They spend money just to enjoy themselves. How can they bear it all night? It‚Äôs really hard work. It‚Äôs funny to check out. Maybe it‚Äôs because of me. Don't worry, the Hainanese in front of me gave me two boxes of partridge tea when I checked out, and I gave me a box to say sorry and ask me to give a good review. Do you really think I don't understand Haipu's words? Please, am I really missing that half box of partridge tea? Obviously being treated differently, okay! Those who have good reviews probably haven‚Äôt seen Junlan before. Now that there are more people who go there, they are all coaxed up, and there are also many people who write good reviews. Even the locals are really not simple at all. I want to say , Not all the tourists who stay in your hotel are foreign tourists. Who hasn't stayed in Hainan for a few years? Needless to say, there are services, and there is nothing else. I can mention by the way that Guantang in Qionghai is still good. It looks refreshing and clean both indoors and outdoors. The mangroves in Sanya, hehe, Comparable to Narada, no matter how bad the mangrove forest is, at least it didn't get bitten in the room! ! Forget it, I don‚Äôt want to be pretentious about the others, I‚Äôm too lazy to type, it‚Äôs almost half past midnight, don‚Äôt call me after this comment, I won‚Äôt delete it, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with it!

I thought it was a mountain villa, but I didn‚Äôt expect it to be a second-floor villa. The room was filled with a musty smell. I am really good at buying but not good at selling. I am really speechless. Secondly, the buffet dinner was the worst buffet I have ever eaten in these years. I couldn‚Äôt bear to part with some cheap seafood. The breakfast was also very poor. For a five-star hotel, there was not even the most basic bacon that could be eaten. There are not many ingredients, and the hot spring pools may only be open in the off-season. If you continue to operate like this, you will only have fewer and fewer customers. I'm visiting your house and I'm definitely not paying attention. I hope hotel leaders will think twice.

There is nothing to say about the entire hotel environment. It is completely in the state of the tropical rain forest. It is the best environment for relaxing and maintaining health. The air is particularly fresh. The two swimming pools and three large outdoor health spa pools are particularly appreciated. The hotel service staff treat people with courtesy, especially the hotel lobby manager Lan Tingting, who has a strong service concept and communication skills, making us feel at home. What also left a deep impression is that the driver of the battery car is amiable and is on call 24 hours a day. Although we live in a remote area of the hotel, the guarantee of the vehicle allows us to travel and play on time. In short, it is a very distinctive hotel in Baoting, and I hope to experience it.

You can call the tour bus at any time after checking in to pick up and drop off at the resort's designated parking point. The equipment and facilities are relatively complete, which is very suitable for the elderly and children to travel together. The location of the room is right next to the mirror swimming pool, which is very convenient. I swam a few laps and felt very good. When I returned to the room, I could soak in the hot springs in a beautiful environment with extremely high negative oxygen ions. The room is on the mountain, so the private bath is very convenient.

msg:The hotel was planted by my mother. My mother has stayed in it twice. This time, I happened to be on vacation this time, so she insisted on pulling me to stay again to experience it. Super shocking staying experience, driving more and more up the mountain, only to find that the hotel is in the Qixianling Tropical Rainforest Resort, a hotel in the rainforest, the air is very fresh, the season is neither cold nor hot, especially warm, Staying for three nights is a good experience of the comfort of soaking in hot springs‚ô®Ô∏è every day. The hotel rooms are not very new, but they are well maintained. Each room has a hot spring pool. When you go out, you have a car to pull you where you want to go. When you walk on the small road of the hotel, you can see the cute jackfruit hanging on the tree when you look up. The breakfast variety in the hotel's 75 restaurant is too rich and the coconut chicken hot pot in Taoyuan Restaurant is very delicious. In particular, I would like to praise Lan Tingting, the lobby manager who helped us check in and gave us a lot of tips on travel routes. She is a beautiful and gentle girl from Hainan. She is very impressive and her service is exquisite and in place. She helped us all the way to the final check-out and departure , and also gave us an exquisite souvenir-Qixianling's unique herbal tea, I like her üëç, and I will definitely ask her for service next time I come to the hotel.

In addition, I would like to praise the hotel's lobby manager, Manager Zhu, for his excellent service. The itinerary was tight this time, and we only stayed for one night.

Besides the disadvantages
1. Old hotel with very old facilities

Due to temporary changes in the itinerary, the application for check-out one day in advance was rejected. The hotel and Ctrip shirked each other, and no check-out fee was paid no matter how much they negotiated. Bawang‚Äôs clause stipulates that the order cannot be canceled after 30 minutes. Please check carefully before placing an order. Otherwise, no check-out fee will be paid if you can't live! Ctrip's customer service supervisor job number is 714585. The complaint was escalated to the supervisor, and the supervisor directly replied that the room fee would not be refunded, and no one could handle it. The hotel has been replying that it has not received a refund application, and the two parties are playing the customer as a ball. It is recommended that everyone encounter this matter and complain to Alipay 12315 or Black Cat app to protect their rights and interests.
In the end, I changed the itinerary and checked into the hotel, which was also quite tortuous. When checking in, the front desk called the guest room to confirm that the room can be checked in. After entering the door, the stinky socks of the previous guest were still on the table, there was garbage on the floor, and the bath towels were placed randomly. Later, I learned that the room was not cleaned. Checked in, a very low-level mistake, called the front desk and said to send a fruit plate, (a small apple and two small oranges, the so-called fruit plate) did not offer to change the room, but changed at my request One is indeed the one in the farthest corner of the entire hotel. The room facilities are very old and the sanitation is average. If you have requirements for the check-in experience, don't choose this hotel. It is really very old. The next morning, when I went out to eat breakfast, the doorway was full of tableware and linens that had been evacuated from other rooms. After eating, there were even more piles at the doorway. I didn‚Äôt understand what this was about. In short, the check-in process is hard to describe. The food in the hotel restaurant (the last picture) feels good because the service attitude of some staff is very enthusiastic. The environment in the mountains is good, and the hot springs are good.

It has a beautiful environment, high content of negative oxygen, and excellent planning and design. Hot spring pool. The hot spring here produces 7,000 tons of water a day, and the temperature of the water is 93 degrees. It takes a while to cool down before taking a bath. The hot spring water has high trace element content and strong penetrating power, making the skin slippery after soaking. The hotel is elegantly decorated, well-equipped, and comfortable to stay. Breakfast is particularly rich. The service is considerate, the battery car will take you everywhere at any time, a plate of fruit is delivered every day, and there are souvenirs when you check out. You can enjoy all kinds of delicacies in several dining halls, or you can eat at the farmhouse outside the hotel, which is more affordable.
We took the Lingji Line 5 bus from Lingshui to Shiling Town for 15 yuan, and then took the Baoting bus to Baoting County for 3 yuan. In Baoting County, there is a small bus that stops at the beck and call, and the fare is 5 yuan to the entrance of the lobby of Narada Resort Hotel, which is more convenient.
This time I stayed in the hotel for two days, soaked in the hot springs twice, and visited Qixian Ridge. It was a very pleasant trip.

msg:The hotel is located in the tropical rainforest mountain, the geothermal hot spring is very good, the hotel is a very large tropical rainforest park (not compared with the tropical rainforest of the Chinese Academy of Sciences), Narada is really good for children to experience the tropical rainforest. The most comfortable thing is Junlan's eating problem. The hotel's food and beverage taste is not bad. The advantage is that there is a 24-hour meal delivery service. The restaurants are also very convenient and the price is not high. This solves the big problem of how to eat when the hotel is located in a remote location. I will consider staying again next winter. It is a good place for cat winter, and I can give it full marks!

msg:If you drive by yourself, it's easy to find by following the navigation. But the price/performance ratio is extremely low. The so-called hot springs are 5 small outdoor pools. The Internet celebrity swimming pool is just like that, there are quite a lot of leaves and branches inside. Because of the service, equipment and other reasons described below, we had no heating in the room, the windows could not be closed, the electric blanket was not hot, and we were dragged around by the shuttle bus in the cold weather, and we caught a cold when we went back. .

Room Facilities:
The house facilities are simply not worth the price. First of all, the plug-in port is loose. We can only find a way to fix the two plugs next to the bed, otherwise we will not be able to charge at all.
Not to mention electric blankets, root! Book! No! hot! My husband and I ended up being crammed into another single bed at night. [sad]
The waiters are not wearing n95 masks, and we dare not let them in. [Oops]
The wind has been so strong these two days that we couldn't lock our windows, and the trees outside had fallen.

breakfast:
I spend an average of 1/4 of the time in a hotel every year (business trip + tourism, staying so many times, and it was the first time I met them saying that someone had breakfast in the room, we said "impossible" at the same time, and they also said "nine o'clock There are too many,‚Äù and I didn‚Äôt want us to enter. I said, ‚ÄúThen help us find out who picked up our card and swiped it. You are responsible for the investigation.‚Äù After I said this, I reluctantly let us in.

breakfast:
The quality of the breakfast and dinner buffets is average. The seafood is not fresh enough and is frozen. The small wontons in the morning are almost all fat.

Serve:
It's very convenient to call a car, but the order of seeing off the passengers is a bit confusing. For example, we didn't tell us where to go first before we got on the board, and let us sit down. It turned out that the distance from a to b passed through cde...until I said "We got in the car first, are you going to see us off?" Then it was our turn. In fact, you can tell us clearly in advance that we can wait for the next car.

msg:It is worthy of a good place for vacation and health care. In the deep mountains, the air is very good, it is very quiet, and it is a paradise. The villa lanai also has a hot spring bath. There is a battery car shuttle to and from the hotel. The jackfruit restaurant is also very good, the food is also very good, the Taoyuan Restaurant is very famous, and the taste is really good! We all like it here, there is a children's playground, it is relatively large, and the experience is very good! And it is cost-effective, very suitable for family vacations. The environment and service are first-class, the climate is very comfortable, and the driving and transportation are very convenient. After coming here, we were not disappointed. Let me say that the hotel has a very good environment and a large area. If you need to climb the mountain in Qixianling Forest Park, the traffic is very convenient. The environment of the hotel is pure and beautiful. There are many trees and green plants. The hotel is very close to Qixianling Park. Linghui is suitable for relaxing and relaxing in hot springs. The decoration of the room is a simple style of garden wood style. The sanitation is clean and tidy, and the facilities are well-equipped and well maintained.
The scenery around the room is very good, you can see the outside scenery from the room, and even the most common room has a swimming pool inside and outside, there are many choices for breakfast, the hotel swimming pool and the surrounding scenery are very good, The environment is not bad; this is the best buffet breakfast and dinner I have had during my trip in Hainan, the price is also very cheap, they also provide free juice and soda, every hotel staff service I encountered is very efficient, Qixianling Narada is really a very distinctive hotel. The air is fresh and the temperature is suitable for mountains, water and hot springs. The hotel also has three large swimming pools, a strong Amway mirror swimming pool. The whole hotel feels really good to me, the price is very affordable, there are buffets and hot springs available, and the service is also very good. The waiters are very nice.
This is the most unique hotel we stayed in on our way around Hainan. After dinner, the hotel also sent fruit, especially Hainan specialty tea when we checked out, thank you very much! This is an unforgettable trip, I will definitely come again if I have a chance, give the hotel a big thumbs up!

In the morning, I had diarrhea more than ten times. In the end, I just had water. My husband and I had the same symptoms. It was absolutely ****. When I checked out, I reported it to the front desk, but no one came to solve the problem. The service attitude of a five-star hotel is like this. They shirk responsibility. I waited in the lobby for more than ten minutes, but no one came to solve the problem. This is the worst five-star hotel I have ever stayed in.

The scenery in the hotel is still very good, the fresh and moist air, the real air is sweet, and the service that everyone encounters is super considerate and warm. Friends who like to come here to play and relax can Consider staying. The waiter took the initiative to greet us. The breakfast is rich, and nutrition and health care are emphasized. The rooms are independent villas, which are very distinctive. The rooms are clean and spacious, and the facilities are well-equipped. The park has a battery car for 24-hour transportation, which is very convenient. There is a dehumidifier in the room. The response to the car call is timely, the double-layer infinity pool is really beautiful, and the breakfast at the hotel is really rich and delicious. I am a northerner and actually have tofu flowers that I liked to eat when I was a child... It is very convenient to climb and walk. The hotel has its own back mountain called Rainforest Adventure. If you like it, if you are interested, you can also take a mountaineering trip to your satisfaction. The environment is very good, the breakfast is very rich, the hot springs are also very comfortable, the air is very smooth after soaking, the air is very good, the hotel is picked up by battery car 24 hours a day, in short, it is very nice and great, and I plan to invite some good friends to come over next vacation. play ü•≥ü•≥

msg:This accommodation experience is the best one I have lived on the island in recent years. There are really value for money hotels, not only the hotel scenery, facilities, sanitation, and service can be said to be cross-level, and there are small surprises everywhere after a day's stay. . . I say one by one.
When we checked in, there were quite a lot of guests. When we waited for the car, if we waited for a long time, we would explain patiently to you, so that you will not be left hanging there. After arriving in the room, the decoration can not be considered new, but there is no sanitary dead corner, but it still makes people feel that the style is so, and it will not feel dirty and old. The largest swimming pool in the hotel can be said to be in the first echelon of the infinity pool on the island. I haven't felt the joy of discovering the scenery for a long time (only a small part of the picture was taken). Oh yes, the hotel's milk coffee ice cream balls are absolutely perfect (be careful to lose weight). After the swim, I went to the hot spring again, because the epidemic situation is not very open, but there are also various temperatures, and free tea and sugar water are also available. Because I didn't want to go out to toss at dinner, I had a buffet at the hotel, and a coupon was issued when I checked in, which was very cost-effective. The dishes basically satisfy all kinds of tastes, and the taste is higher than the average price in the island. For example, the ice cream balls in the buffet are the same as those bought during the day. The water is tasteless, but similar to the bottled (Colaxi tea, etc.), which is very conscientious. In the evening, the front desk also prepared cakes and fruits for friends who had birthdays on that day. ! During dinner, the waiter also reminded the breakfast time the next day and suggested when to come. The private hot spring pool in the room is also great, and there are massage jets in it, which is very comfortable. For breakfast the next day, there are still surprises in style. In addition to the Chinese and Western meals that other hotels have, there are also small meat patties like baked buns, freshly ground coffee machines, and even tofu brains! ! ! After breakfast, I strolled around the hotel. The air is very fresh and the vegetation is rich. I also saw children experiencing rubber tapping.
This hotel experience is very good. The attitude of the hotel staff is very good. No matter what position you are in, you can feel friendly. You can respond quickly to any request, and you can also meet or solve it, unlike some five-star hotels. , Although he has words, he cannot hide his arrogance. . .
When I come to Qixianling in the future, I will still choose this restaurant. When I check out, I specially leave a message in the room "Thank you for your hospitality".

msg:The facilities are old, one room is not equipped with a dehumidifier, and the dehumidifier in another room does not work. After contacting the service center, it was replaced twice before it was barely used. Moreover, the staff was very impatient and said that the guest insisted that the dehumidifier did not work, and the dehumidifier had already been reported. E1 malfunctioned and said such irresponsible things. In addition, there were four of us staying there. We didn‚Äôt have enough water to drink at night in such a hot weather. We called and asked for two bottles to be delivered, but they said it would cost 5 yuan a bottle! The most unacceptable thing is that I just checked in on Monday and booked the hotel again on Wednesday. I was asked to pay 400 yuan for the same room when I arrived, and the price of each room increased by 200 yuan. This kind of thing happened to affect my mood very much. I would never choose to stay in Baoting again. I recommend this hotel, Longwan Juntang Hotel.

The cleaning aunts and uncles of the Li nationality are kind and enthusiastic. The evening buffet is also great value. I like the tracking activity in the evening the most. Aunt Li led the adults and children to visit the rainforest, where they learned about various interesting animals and plants, and made the most vivid interpretation of the teaching theory of the harmonious development of man and nature.

The hotel is full of interesting tropical gardens, with scattered heights, gurgling streams and diverse vegetation. Although the building facilities are a little old, it is relaxed and quiet. The hot spring is comfortable, there are many homemade ingredients for breakfast, and the taste is good. I don't know if the staff has changed a lot, the service level is very general, and the infinity pool security guard yelled, which is a bit unpleasant. Compared with the fragrance bay Narada service, there is a big gap. It is uncomfortable for service staff to wear military T-shirts, and the external image of the service industry is still more friendly.

It is suggested that the hotel can improve the description of the room type. I was confused when I booked before, and I couldn't figure out the difference between each room type. After checking in, I found that different room types actually have their own characteristics.

One is that you need to take a battery car to enter and exit. The fourth is to drink mountain spring water. The hotel service is very good. As soon as you call, the battery car will arrive and take you to the place you want to go in the hotel, such as the lobby, restaurant, swimming pool, parking lot.

The hotel battery car is very convenient to be on call, which enables us to enjoy the high-quality service of Narada Hotel, and can go deep into the hotel to enjoy the green environment rich in oxygen ions and full of fragrance.

The hotel's double-layer borderless swimming pool and the hot spring pool in the middle of the swimming pool are very distinctive.

Egg Su, the biggest lesson that this trip has taught me is that the hotel has been renovated in 2016 and must be carefully checked in! !

There are also few outdoor hot spring pits. There are two areas dotted with small ones. There is little indoor hot spring water, and the little creatures in the corners are very lively. As mentioned above, it is recommended to be cautious about coming to the hot spring.

üîîService: The hotel introduced that you can only enter the room after 3 pm. There is no way to check in if you arrive early. Have been asking guests to wait in the lobby. So a bunch of people gathered in the lobby. Inefficient check-in. The line at the front desk is always that the guest room has not been cleaned.

üçÉ Environment: The environment is good. But the villa mentioned in the order is actually a row room, and the advantage is that it is close to the net red swimming pool. The downside is the lack of privacy in the room. People come and go outside, so if you don't want to be seen, you have to draw the curtains. The hot spring in the room is also separated from the outside by a bamboo curtain, which cannot be completely covered.
The dinner buffet looks like a lot of things, but it's nothing but enough to eat. The overall experience is generally good. Many places could do better.

Leg bikini, in addition to the room's own hot spring, there are also medicinal baths and small fish therapy outside for entertainment. Regarding the catering, I recommend going to a Chinese restaurant to order food. The quality is higher than the buffet, and the price is more cost-effective. There are also points to complain. There are too many people coming to play. It took almost an hour to check in, mainly waiting for the room to be cleaned. I can understand it completely. Everyone who came here wants to stay for a while. The whole hotel area is in the forest, and the design is very good. Natural harmony, especially focusing on praising Zhu Juanting. First, I took the initiative to contact me to communicate the satisfaction of the stay and what needs to be met. Second, I gave a gift before leaving, which was quite unexpected. Recommend worth a visit

The shortcomings are also very prominent, that is, the hardware facilities are constantly aging, and Narada does not invest in maintenance at all. I made a comment in 2014, and so far there are only worse, moldy wallpaper, doors that cannot be locked, and shutters that cannot be pulled due to the tide. , broken telephone and TV. I was the only one who changed. I used to make a fuss about changing rooms. I don't think it's weird this time. I told the front desk when I left.

There are various pools and hot springs on site, although the pool near the lobby is often used by external tour groups, which is why we tended to use the other pools. The breakfast is good with a good selection. The restaurants on site are OK, the "Western" is not really Western and we preferred the Chinese restaurant. There was room service, but only a few dishes from the menu were actually available. Unfortunately, there was hardly anything in the area around the hotel that was suitable for us as a family with two small children. The children's offerings are very limited and only in Chinese. There is an indoor playroom, which is OK. The outdoor playground was very bleak. In general, there was no one who could speak English, so we made do with WeChat and translation.

The disadvantages are: 1. The room in Building 2 smells of smoke. I don‚Äôt know why. 2. There is no place for the guests to soak their feet. You must wear a bathing suit. If you want to soak in the outdoor pool, you can‚Äôt bubble your feet. 3. Both the battery car staff and the hotel concierge wear camouflage uniforms. They don't understand. The front desk staff are in uniform uniforms. The camouflage uniforms are a bit like being in a military camp. . .

In addition, the hotel is very close to the entrance of Qixianling Mountain, so the hotel does not have a good distance and platform to view Qixianling from a distance, and Qixianling can go to the lobby of Juntang Hotel.

[Applause] About the service
1. From the beginning of check-in, I found that the waiter was very enthusiastic, and the shuttle bus was also very timely. A phone call can pick us up in time and send it to the hotel where I want to go (the hotel is really a super large tropical rainforest) Oxygen bar) ~
2. When we had breakfast in the morning, even the cleaning staff asked us where we were going and told us the location of the restaurant.
3. During the house, the waiter will also deliver fruit after dinner time.
4. Finally during the check-out period, the hotel lobby manager also took the initiative to call in advance, let us wait a while and send us a very intimate souvenir as a souvenir~

[Kiss] Hotel Facilities
In addition to the hotel‚Äôs infrastructure, we also experienced clocking in:
1. There is a hot spring pool in the room that can be enjoyed privately.
2. There is also a natural wild stream hot spring that can be enjoyed outdoors.
3. There are also various check-in spots in the hotel, which are all about the vegetation in the tropical rain forest. After eating, you can walk around in the hotel to wash your lungs. It is a natural oxygen bar. (The air in the hotel is really good, and the water quality is also very soft.)
4. Surprisingly, I was planted by the hotel's shower gel, shampoo and conditioner. It is especially easy to use shampoo. After using it, the hair is very fluffy and soft. It's a pity that the lobby manager said that they will change to a new brand soon. This one is no longer in stock.

üöóAbout traffic
 It is recommended that you drive there by yourself, because the traffic in the mountains is relatively inconvenient and it is far from the city. There is no takeaway to order because it is far from the city. The takeaway will not reach the mountain, and the food can only be satisfied by inquiries at the hotel as much as possible~

üçúAbout food
The dining experience in the hotel‚Äôs "Narada Resort Qixianling 7/5 Restaurant" is very good. There are many types of breakfast in the form of self-service, including soup, porridge, eggs, and drinks, coffee, milk, and more. There are after-dinner fruits, stir-fried vegetables, bread desserts, etc. The ingredients are fresh and the taste is quite good~

In short, whether it is service or hotel environment and facilities, it is a very good journey and hotel experience! üòò

msg:In Baoting Qixianling Narada, the service of individual staff at the front desk is very average. The customer service operator has poor service awareness and complained about the bad network. The answer is because there are too many people. The implication is that there is no way to solve it. I have booked for two days, do you want me to be isolated from the world in the deep mountains and old forests for two days? During the day, I still need to contact the company for work. I can‚Äôt access the Internet with a laptop. I can only borrow a network cable. I didn‚Äôt expect that the network cable is connected or there is no network. Then I asked if there is a master who can come and check the line. The answer is that IT is off work. Oh my god. Finally, a maintenance master was sent to help check the network and it returned to normal. It's totally different from the number of people who used it before. Hope the hotel can strengthen the training of its staff, don't think that it's all done perfunctory. The highlight of the hotel is the infinity pool, which has a good environment and clean water. The quality of the buffet dinner is also ok, and the service is also very good.

This time I made a special trip to Sanya to stay at Narada Resort Hotel in Qixianling. The environment is beautiful and the accommodation conditions are very satisfactory. Each room is hidden in the tropical rain forest with towering old trees. It is especially suitable for personal self-cultivation or family vacation. The front desk service was also very enthusiastic, and the local tea was presented as a gift before leaving. It is indeed the back garden of Sanya. The temperature here is on average 3-5¬∞C lower than that in the urban area of Sanya. It is 40 kilometers away from Haitang Bay, with high speed all the way.

Due to the outbreak in Hainan, we had to cut some itineraries and opened up Qixianling earlier. Lan. First of all, the environment is really nothing to say. The lush tropical rain forest is scattered with small houses. We have encountered many small squirrels here for three days. If you carefully observe at night, there are flashing fireflies in the bushes, which can explain The ecological environment here is very good. Secondly, the attitude of every waiter to driver and event organizer here is very good, answer all questions, the battery car is on call, the lobby manager Wang Xin is enthusiastic and considerate, we first booked two nights to renew the original house. There is no room for the type, he helped me to coordinate and give advice in various aspects and finally solved the problem of renewal. In addition, the hotel has a total of three swimming pools. Even in the peak season of summer vacation, there are not many activities because there are many people. The hotel also has several free activities to participate. Although free, the staff is not sloppy and the work is done seriously. In terms of catering, The breakfast is complete and rich, and the Chinese food in Taoyuan Xiaoguan is enough and stable. We stayed for four days and three nights. One of the dinners went to the roadside farmhouse. The whole family felt that it was not as good as the hotel restaurant, and the price was not cheap. The happy trip is over. My son explained that he still wants to come in the next year. I hope the epidemic will subside quickly. We should spend some more time in Narada Qixianling on our next trip to Hainan.

msg:Always have to walk around in Hainan. I like Baoting Qixianling Tropical Rainforest Tourist Area the most. This time I stayed at Narada Resort Hotel, the service is good, the environment is also acceptable, but the hotel building is old-fashioned, the stone veneer on the facade is dark and old, the swimming pool is old, and the room interior and space are acceptable. The facilities and hardware are much worse than Narada hotels in other parts of Hainan.
     What needs to be praised is that when I booked the room, I placed the wrong order and booked the next day to the hotel the day before. At 11 p.m. Ctrip called and asked me when I was in the store, and I knew that I had booked the wrong time. This is my own negligence. Considering that it is the off-season, please contact the hotel to request a rescheduling. After tossing for a while, Ctrip communicated. I received a notice on the way to the hotel at noon the next day, and the hotel agreed to extend the check-in date to the same day. After arriving at the hotel, I successfully arranged check-in and found that the two rooms in the main building I had booked were upgraded to villa rooms, and they were beside the second swimming pool of Banpo Hotel, and the rooms had private hot spring pools. Of course it was overjoyed. When I left, I received the souvenir (clearing hot tea) from the hotel and felt the warmth of the hotel's emphasis on customer marketing services. This must be praised.
     It is hot summer, there are not many guests in the hotel, and a large number of people in the dinner buffet restaurant. Moved by the enthusiasm of the hotel, I would like to make some suggestions for the hotel. There are many Qixianling resort hotels. The hardware facilities of Narada Hotel are not good. Compared with the two hotels I stayed in last year, the design and quality of hot spring pools are quite different, the number of pools is not enough, and the landscape design has no special features. There are many villas on the hillside, the stone veneer of Guan Jian‚Äôs facade has no special features, and the roof has not been designed. The visual effect is very poor under the unobtrusive background of the large betel nut forest. It is recommended to beautify the facade of the building uniformly. All walls are whitewashed to highlight the texture of the stone. The dark lines of the window frames and door frames are reserved. The wooden staircase fences are all replaced by glass, emphasizing the eye-catching and modern sense. This trea**ent costs money. Not much, there may be a new look, forming a Mediterranean Greek feel. I once talked about this idea to the customer service manager who was interviewing on the phone. I wonder if she conveyed it to the boss.

msg:Driving from Sanya all the way, the scenery is very beautiful, the road under the expressway is being renovated, and it is muddy when it rains, which is a test for vehicles with low chassis. In the three hotels I stayed at, Grand Hyatt, Narada, Raffles Narada is the only hotel to call the night before check-in. The entire park is very large, with virgin forests and banana trees and jackfruit trees everywhere. Lohas Villa is the family room closest to the double-layer mirrored swimming pool, one large and one small. Two beds, the room is damp but there is a dehumidifier, the bedding is actually very dry, the balcony soaks, the bathroom bath will cause the floor to be wet, after the dehumidifier is turned on, the dehumidifier will also drain to the floor of the house, so the floor will never dry. Room service and the front desk are full of sincerity under the condition of limited hardware, which has best demonstrated the high-quality service. It is also very convenient to eat around. Walking in the park is like a paradise.

msg:The hotel is on the mountainside, surrounded by tropical rainforest. The room facilities are old and there are bugs üêõü¶é~~~
The concierge service is in place and is on call. The quality of the buffet dishes in the western restaurant is average. At the checkout, I asked me to scan the manager‚Äôs personal QR code. After being rejected by me, I changed to the POS scan code! !
When checking out, the lobby manager inquired about the feeling of staying in, etc., and gave a small gift.

Call the battery car to pick up and drop off very quickly. The room facilities are well-equipped, clean and clean. It is also very good.

Supplement: The overall is very good, very suitable to experience the hotel in the tropical and subtropical rain forest. The only thing to note is that you need to take a taxi in advance (one way) from the hotel back to the city, and you need to plan in advance to avoid flight delays.

msg:I have stayed in a lot of hotels so far, but the breakfast at this one is really good, and the seafood buffet restaurant in the evening is great, affordable and inexpensive. The hotel has a great location and is located in the National Forest Park. The battery car in the hotel is very convenient to get there. Every little brother who drives is very enthusiastic and good at service. What I like most is the hot spring and hotel environment. The hotel is large, natural oxygen bar, fresh air, and strategic location. After breakfast, walk the rainforest trail, listen to the sound of nature, look at the mountain league stone, and hug the super large albizia tree. There is also an infinity mirror swimming pool that is particularly beautiful, suitable for Internet celebrities to check in. The hot spring resources are abundant, where nature has given mankind so much beauty! The lobby manager Wang Xiaoshuai has a strong sense of service, warm and cheerful, and treats guests with special care. We have always chosen Narada.

msg:The hotel is in the tropical rain forest, as if you have come to Thailand. Because the epidemic cannot leave the country, but in Narada, I found the feeling of Thailand. The air tastes the same as Thailand. The mirror pool is beautiful. The most pleasant thing is to soak in the hot springs in the room while looking at the tropical rainforest outside the window. The hotel service is very good, especially the lobby manager Lan Tingting, who also called to greet and send souvenirs. Next time I go to Hainan, I will come to Junlan Hot Spring.

In the morning, I wake up to the sound of streams and birdsong. It is another day full of vitality. The rooms are also very clean. The facilities do not have the shabby feeling in other reviews. It feels very good. There is a private pool on the balcony. The children are very happy to soak. The hotel‚Äôs mirrored swimming pool is great and the photos taken are beautiful. The hotel‚Äôs breakfast is good, the Taoyuan restaurant has great food tastes, and the price/performance ratio is quite high. In the afternoon, I took part in the Paya Tracking activity for an hour, along the forest path of the hotel, I learned a lot of plants, especially suitable for children. There are a variety of wild plants in the hotel. I saw big lotus trees, jackfruits, and large betel palm trees. There are plant introductions beside many wild plants here. The children also saw little squirrels several times. ~Special thanks to the deputy manager of the lobby, Chan, the service is very good, the service is meticulous from the beginning of the check-in, and it is very kind and comfortable to get along with. The hotel staff are honest and enthusiastic, and treat people sincerely. It is a very caring hotel and I would recommend it to my friends.

msg:Checking in for the first time, I think it‚Äôs pretty good in the online reviews. Kids in the rainforest environment should like it. I really think it‚Äôs pretty good when I came. This hotel is really good, the environment is beautiful, the decoration of the hotel is also beautiful, and it looks very comfortable from the outside a feeling of. The internal equipment and facilities are OK, and the price for staying in this off-season is also OK, recommended by friends who have been to Hainan on vacation, and there is a private swimming pool outside the room. The hotel will provide catering services, and the taste is great~ The hotel has a large and long sightseeing promenade, which is now a very famous tourist attraction. The hotel will provide free parking. The overall feeling is really good, still in the tropical rain forest-but the hotel is quite good, the staff inside are polite, especially the lobby assistant Lan Tingting's warm service, warm service, worthy of praise! This is a typical representative of quiet and comfortable-this is the most unique hotel we stayed on our way around Hainan. Little villas are scattered in the rainforest, and there are various exotic trees and grasses and cute squirrels climbing trees. Every day When you open the window in the morning, you can smell the rich fragrance of flowers. The design of the hotel is also very careful, taking full account of the balance between man and nature, and the building will make room for the big trees to grow. The staff in all depar**ents of the hotel are also very friendly and courteous. I feel that the staff have provided meticulous care to my family during our stay. The service is worthy of being a five-star. The beautiful environment allows us to blend in with nature. The hotel‚Äôs service is very in place and the staff are warm and courteous. The viewing platform through the hall can see the top of Qixianling Mountain from afar, but Narada Qixianling is indeed a very unique family and it is definitely worth a stay! ‚ÄîIt's also worth it! Overall, I feel very good and will come again.

The entire hotel is in the rain forest. The restaurant was eating and taking pictures. This time I was a bit rushed. I didn't experience the various activities in the hotel. I will definitely come and stay for a few more days next time I have the opportunity.

msg:I have stayed in several places nearby, and personally think Narada is the best hotel in Baoting area. Drive on the tree-lined road, full of green eyes, fresh air, lungs and lungs üòÑ. The rooms are clean and large enough. The breakfast is very good, and the glass restaurant is said to have always been an Internet celebrity restaurant. Taoyuan Xiaoguan tastes good and the waiters are very nice. Several farmhouses near the hotel also taste good. The most important thing is that the hotel has a large private courtyard and rainforest environment, enough to take a walk and exercise in the hotel after getting up in the morning. The hotel has three and four swimming pools: under the lobby, two upper and lower net celebrity mirror pools, and a swimming pool with hot springs next to it. The battery car is on call everywhere in the hotel, which is very convenient. There is a private hot spring pool on the balcony of the room. Before leaving, Miss Lanting T in the lobby also gave a souvenir with a cup with the hotel logo.
The hotel‚Äôs No. 2 building is a three-story building with a corridor, a single-sided room, a small stream outside the balcony, the stream gurgling occasionally has frog calls, and it feels great to rest after listening to the rain! The rest are mostly two-story small villas scattered around the hotel.
The fly in the oin**ent is that Qixianling is almost never seen in the hotel. The floor tiles outside the house are slippery due to the high water vapor. If you are careless, it is easy to slip and you should consider improving it.

msg:The environment of the tropical rain forest is absolutely nothing. The air is humid and fresh. The park is equipped with negative oxygen ion monitoring equipment. The only thing that needs to be psychologically prepared is that the ecological environment is so good that my love and I feel a little drunk. Thanks to the staff who escorted us to the room. Because we reported the wrong room number, the staff helped us with two heavy luggage and went to the second floor. The warm and thoughtful service made us very touched. The rooms in Yunling Villa are medium in size, comfortable and tidy, with well-equipped facilities. I love the dehumidifier in the room. The private pool on the balcony is very comfortable. While ensuring privacy, you can also see the net celebrity pool at a glance. I really like the hot spring water here. The water is mild and soft. After two days of soaking, the skin has become soft and smooth. Breakfast is at restaurant 75, outside is a mountain stream, the scenery has nothing to say, the combination of Chinese and Western style, the variety is abundant, and the taste is good. The overall service of the hotel is in place, and it is a very good resort hotel in all aspects. Praise to Wang Chan, the lobby manager, from the beginning to the end, the sincere and thoughtful service from before arrival to after departure left a very deep impression on us. Later Baoting will choose this hotel and will definitely recommend it to friends around.
