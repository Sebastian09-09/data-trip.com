msg:Facilities: The facilities are very complete, with everything you need. The gym and laundry room are on the first floor, which is quite convenient.

Hygiene: To be honest, the hygiene is quite good. The room is very large. I upgraded to a river view room later.

Environment: The transportation is quite convenient. It is very close to Beijing Road, which is quite suitable for people like me who come to travel. It doesn’t take long to take a taxi back to the hotel after walking around Beijing Road. It is also not far from Xihua Road, which is quite suitable for people like me who like to check in and eat. The hotel is next to the pier for the Pearl River Night Cruise, which is just a few steps away. It is very convenient, haha.

Service: The service is generally good. From the moment I entered the door, someone helped me pull my luggage. The front desk also poured tea and sent me to the room when I checked in. By the way, they also sent fruits. The fruits are very good and fresh~

Overall, I am very satisfied. It has everything you need. The hotel staff is also very enthusiastic. If I come to Guangzhou for business or travel next time, I will consider staying in this hotel again😜

The hotel is right by the river, and it is very convenient to shop in the nearby shopping malls. This location can be said to be excellent, especially for traveling to Guangzhou for vacation, the hotel is very convenient to go anywhere.
The hotel has just opened, and the service is still in place.
Breakfast is on the 8th floor of the hotel, semi-self-service, rich in variety, and good. Overall, I am quite satisfied. The room also arranged a thoughtful fruit plate

msg:The hotel is relatively high-end and modern. It is currently being renovated and upgraded. The rooms are larger and the stay is very comfortable. The scenery is very good. It is very close to Dashatou Pier. It is convenient for eating and shopping nearby. The service staff are very enthusiastic, especially Lingling. At the beginning I wasn’t satisfied with the room I saw, so I took a look at two other vacant rooms, and finally changed to the room type I liked. The only drawback was that it was a little noisy as it was close to the Pearl River. I could hear the sound of punches downstairs very clearly. It’s worth mentioning that , the hotel has a complete range of children's supplies, and also provides children's dolls and souvenirs.

(All the staff were enthusiastic, professional and meticulous, especially Dannie and Lingling. Sorry, I only remember these two. The name of the guest) The room and bathroom are large in size and in good sanitary condition. There are sockets everywhere in the room for easy use. Chargers are also carefully prepared. The bar drinks and tea are all available and the supplies are timely. Breakfast is a buffet, with plenty of variety and delicious food. The people-oriented and attentive service is refreshing and worth staying again💯

msg:Location: Very convenient. The back door of the hotel is the Tianzi Wharf. It is very convenient to go anywhere and you can reach it by walking. Hygiene: It is quite clean. This is the advantage of chain hotels. You will not step on thunder and encounter that kind of dirty, messy and humid environment. Service: The brother at the front desk is very friendly. I just checked in during the May Day holiday. The brother at the front desk upgraded me to a river view room for free. I can also see the cruise ship at night. I am quite satisfied with it. And parking is convenient. Nearby hotels generally do not have parking lots, and it is free. The river view downstairs is so beautiful. After dinner, I can just walk with my family. The overall experience is quite good. My family likes it very much. I will stay here again next time~
