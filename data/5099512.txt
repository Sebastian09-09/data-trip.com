msg:The new garden building is located in the ancient town of Shicheng. It is not popular at night. Not only does the room have a musty smell, but there is also a lot of methane in the underground pipes. It is so smoked that I can't even open the windows or doors, but I still can't sleep. I actually saw a 5cm big spider 🕷️ lying on the pillow before falling asleep, and I was shocked. I really don’t dare to live there anymore.

msg:During the May Day holiday, I was thinking about the crowded trip to Qiandao Lake. I found a quiet place in the city of Lion City. Pu Shi was the place where I could rest my mind and body during this journey. The outdoor is a Hui-style building, and the interior is modern. I added the hotel phone number in advance. The two rooms I booked were placed next to each other. One of them was upgraded to a two-bedroom suite. It was really nice. The hotel arranged a May Day music bonfire party and a fireworks show during the holiday. I almost told them that the top 30 of the regional competition of China is good last year were here. It’s a pity that my family just wanted to enjoy the relaxation of the holiday and didn’t introduce themselves on stage. You can experience textiles, VR, and Hanfu for free when staying in the hotel. The Chinese restaurant in the hotel tastes very delicious. We ordered it a la carte, and the waiter was also very good. He introduced the ingredients and methods of each dish, etc. The breakfast noodles on the second day left a deep impression on my parents and they thought it was delicious. The hotel is right by the lake. After breakfast, I strolled around the lake view. The May Day holiday was beautiful.

msg:Eight years ago, a friend introduced me to this treasure resort hotel. At that time, the owner was still Shanghai Greenland. The use of Greenland Platinum luxury brand was enough to show the owner's investment and positioning in this project. However, not long after, the owner resold the hotel to Hangzhou local owner Xintiandi and renamed it Pu Shi brand. Despite this, the excellent features of the hotel have been preserved. All 82 guest rooms are designed with Hui-style courtyards, which are integrated with the local culture at the junction of Zhejiang and Anhui in the Xin'an River Basin. Each guest room has its own characteristic vegetation in the courtyard.
The housekeeper took it to the door of the mansion, and the lantern with the owner's surname 🏮 restored the culture of the wealthy residences in Wenyuan Lion City to the extreme, and the stay experience was instantly enhanced.
The Hui-style courtyard of Xin'an Garden, where I stayed this time, adopts a three-entry design. The first entrance uses a traditional key to open the door to see the outdoor courtyard. The second entrance is the indoor living hall, and the third entrance is the second-floor bedroom. The traditional wooden house style design instantly brings an immersive Jiangnan vacation experience. The bathroom is large and equipped with a double basin design and a deep soaking bathtub. At a time when cost control of toiletries is popular, it is still adhering to the original intention of using more hygienic small bottles. You can enjoy the hotel's fitness facilities, tour the replica of the ancient city and perform all day. If it weren't for the lack of privacy in the ancient city, it would be a substitute for Amman or Ritz-Carlton Hidden Resort, but the room rate may be only 10% of theirs, how high is the cost performance. In terms of service, three of us checked in, and the front desk took the initiative to arrange for the delivery of quilts and toiletries. They greeted us with a smile throughout the whole process and guided us to introduce the hotel facilities and how to use them. It was very professional. The only two weaknesses are that the quality of the hotel's catering has a lot of room for improvement. During the New Year, the Chinese restaurant only has set meals available and the price of the dishes has increased a lot. The quality of the breakfast ingredients in the buffet restaurant is too low, which is not in line with the hotel's positioning. The swimming pool is open too late, and I hope it will be improved.

msg:I bought a two-night package for a Qingming trip. I encountered a big spider, a big moth, and a big centipede on the first floor. The room was quite clean. I wiped the desk with a tissue and it didn't turn black. The curtains outside the bathroom are bamboo curtains, which are light-transmitting. You can see clearly from the outside at night. If you need to change the blackout curtains, I have to find a way to cover them myself, otherwise I won’t be able to get dressed after taking a shower. There is also the automatic sensor light in the cabinet. It always lights up on its own on the first night and never goes dark. The timid ones thought it was a baby coming. In the middle of the night, I felt like the sensor light kept jumping and the room was always bright. Sorry, I came from Shanghai and was stuck in a traffic jam for 9 hours during the day, so I didn’t get a good rest at night. The next day during the day, I unplugged the wiring connection and slept through it. The breakfast is okay, the noodles are delicious and can fill you up until the evening, two meals a day.

msg:The hotel has a simple and elegant Hui style. The hotel is located in the ancient town of Wenyuan Shicheng. It happened to be the first Folk Customs and Culture Festival of Qiandao Lake. Shicheng is much more lively than usual. The hotel service is relatively warm and responsive. It is pet-friendly. The surrounding scenery is nice. The balcony looks out to the scenery of Qiandao Lake. There are many people setting off fireworks by the lake during the Chinese New Year. It is also interesting to stroll around the scenic area, see red plums, try snacks, and buy some handicrafts. The only drawback is that the breakfast is sloppy, with few choices and not very delicious... It would be perfect if it could be improved.

msg:Generally speaking, there is no crowding around the scenic area during the Spring Festival, which is a plus. The hotel staff is enthusiastic, which is a plus. The service is thoughtful, which is a plus. The lantern at the door will be labeled with "X Mansion" according to the surname of the person who made the reservation, which is a plus, which is very interesting.
The main points of deduction are as follows
1. The coupons given for the set meal are not very meaningful.
The dining coupons are for the hotel's supporting restaurants. It is better to eat out with this coupon. The cost-effectiveness is low. During the Spring Festival, you can't use the weekday menu to order dishes, only the set meal.
Another Hanfu experience coupon does not mention that makeup and wigs have to be paid separately. I went there twice and no one was there.
2. The room I stayed in was a family room converted from the original suite.
There are several main problems. First, there is only one toilet. Second, the middle door of the master and second bedrooms cannot be closed. Third, the TV in the second bedroom is actually at the head of the bed. The remote control conflicts with the master bedroom. Only one TV can be turned on. There is an open-air bathtub outdoors, but the water supply is cut off and it cannot be used. It is estimated that it is too difficult to clean and maintain.

Secondly, we booked a two-bedroom house this time. At first, we found that the room window could not be opened, and the fresh air system in the room was not very powerful, so we applied for a change of room type, and then moved to another building. Only the bathroom window could be opened, but the bathroom sewer smelled very bad, and the fresh air system was still not powerful...
Finally, the breakfast problem. On the first day, it was said that there were few guests and no buffet was provided. After many guests reported this problem, the hotel provided a buffet breakfast on the second day, but in fact, compared with other regular five-star hotels, the hotel's breakfast still has few options. At the same time, there is basically no service in the restaurant...

We guess the workers didn't even know when the renovation was done, and no wires were connected. . . Yukata is Chinese and more practical than bathrobes.
Poor sense of service, the hotel's stone road, the room is on the second floor, the front desk did not ask once if you need to carry luggage, and did not introduce where the hotel facilities are. A deposit is also required, which is the old way of management.
Breakfast corresponds to the price of this restaurant, because compared to the latter one in Xipo, the variety here is quite complete. The textiles and vr experience in the Ctrip package were not used, and the hotel did not remind them throughout the process.
The surprise is that the Hongfu Hotel in the comment area is the best restaurant in the surrounding ten miles and eight townships. You must eat wild fish head.

Half an hour after we left the hotel, we were told that the laundry bag had been taken away, and we had to send it back, or express it back, and the deposit was withheld until we received the laundry bag and then returned the deposit.

The hotel does not have a sign saying that the laundry bag cannot be taken, and the family also mistakenly think that the storage bag is used to store items. As a hotel, there is a better way to deal with it.

​The hotel is located in the scenic area and is an Hui-style villa with a single door and a single courtyard. Compared with traditional hotels, I prefer ancient buildings, with age, stories, and the feeling of home.
On a rainy morning, waking up from the ancient lion city coincided with the poetry of Dai Wangshu's "Rain Lane".
​The hotel's infinity pool looks beautiful no matter how you look at it, but it is discounted a lot when you look at it.
Everywhere around the hotel is a beautiful view: the bluestone slabs moistened by the rain, the green vines spreading on the mottled walls, the raindrops flying all over the Yangxin Terrace, the branches and leaves that climbed out of the wall unwillingly, the pink and white lotus blooming by the pond, And the orange-red roses that fall on the wall... Everything makes you stop, listen carefully, and slow down the rhythm.

Even the door to the room does not have a modern lock, but a wooden bar. The hotel's infinity pool faces Qiandao Lake, making people feel relaxed and happy. There are opportunities to bring children to stay.

The infinity swimming pool is suitable for punching cards, and children have a great time playing with water guns. The most unexpected thing about this trip was to find that there is a must-eat restaurant in the town, Hongfu Restaurant, which is a delicious one. If I go back next time, this small restaurant will be very attractive to me.

The room was made of wood, but it was clean and refreshing. It is cool and I like the tone of this room very much; especially the infinity swimming pool built by the lake in front of the hotel lobby, the water is so clear that people have the urge to jump immediately after seeing it. Just in the painting, a friend recommended it to me earlier, this time I came to experience it in person, and it really lived up to its reputation, it was really invincible!

Qiandao Lake has become our best choice. Although we have been here many times, Wenyuan Lion City is the No. It really gave me a different feeling when I came here once. The re-enac**ent of the thousand-year-old Lion City under the sleeping water, the Huizhou architecture with white walls and blue tiles, walking on the moss-covered stone road, like a world away, although I am neither a literary nor a young man, I still can’t help stopping on the street, imagining a thousand years ago The prosperity of the city, lamenting the rush of time and the long years!
After feeling, let's talk about the hotel. The hotel is integrated with the ancient city. Each room is a small Hui-style building with a separate courtyard. The red lantern at the door has your surname written on it, which shows the intention. The infinity swimming pool is the favorite of children. If you are afraid of noise, you can go to the indoor heated swimming pool and get what you need. The hotel is in good sanitation, complete facilities, rich breakfast, and warm and thoughtful service.
Affected by the epidemic, the hotel occupancy rate is not high, including the entire ancient city. Although there are not many tourists, the service is not discounted, which gives us a good experience. Everyone is persisting, hoping that the epidemic will pass as soon as possible and life will be back on track.

早餐:
而且服務也很好。早餐是前一天讓你勾選的，估計是淡季，人不是很多，選好了品種之後，且第2天準備好了幫你端上桌，早餐的環境也很棒，和外面的綠蔭相映成趣。牛肉麪真的特別好吃，建議他大家一定要試試看，紅燒牛腩麪，還有皮蛋瘦肉粥和白粥，燉的也特別好，配上小菜，又平淡又好吃。要稀釋的也有培根和煙燻三文魚。紅茶牛奶咖啡黃油等等也該有的都有。
走的時候還給了伴手禮，因為要中秋節了，還送了一盒月餅，送的伴手禮也都是和獅子相關的。

而且他本身酒店是送了各種體驗的和旁邊的老街聯繫在一起，送了漢服，體驗穿着漢服去逛老街拍照，完全不一樣的感覺，而且還有VR體驗，可以帶上威VR眼鏡，看看水下的市場以及古代的獅城的故事以及紡織體驗，有時間可以自己織一塊手帕帶走。

酒店是徽式建築 一門一户的。之前評論裏説的一些管家服務和掛燈籠服務這些都沒有了。房間是很大很漂亮的，就是文淵獅城太荒涼了，過年期間都沒多少人。景區設施不夠完善，沒什麼可逛的。住的房間洗澡熱水不熱，吹風機壞了，體驗特別不好。不過服務員總體態度是很好的。如果沒開車自己去的話，一定要問前台要一個叫車電話，附近太難打車了，我們是沒問直接走出去，要走很長的路去公交站，才叫得到車，總之感覺就是一個特別安靜荒涼的地方。如果很文藝，去一下還是很不錯的

msg:朋友們可以避雷了💣😡 完全不符合五星級酒店的一般標準，至少在衞生和服務上還差的很遠。酒店價格不低，但完全不值，比中心湖區的綠城藍灣差很多，價格還更貴，甚至服務衞生還比不上後來在宏村附近住的精品民宿。看在房間硬件還可以，勉強到四星吧，不能更多了。

服務：下午一點左右到達入住，最曬最熱的時候，提前聯繫過前台告知即將到達。雖然停車場離前台不遠，但都是石板路，前台完全沒有迎接和幫忙拿行李。入住後帶領去房間的工作人員也是看着你自己把行李扛上二樓。

衞生：到了房間就是一個餅乾大的蜘蛛在窗簾上迎接，後面兩天房間和陽台還看到三四衹蟑螂。衞生間的毛巾比較舊，已經有毛邊了。

環境：酒店雖然有泳池，但是配套服務基本沒有。泳池邊躺椅沒有墊子，很硬。也沒有給客人準備的毛巾，需要把房間浴巾自己帶過去很不方便。另外泳池每天幾次的表演音響聲音很大，住在附近房間一天都不安靜。早餐選擇有限，區域看着不小但其實很空，第一天甚至連麪包果醬也沒有。

遊玩：雖説酒店主打周圍安靜，但其實就是旁邊文淵獅城特別冷清，白天晚上都見不到幾個人，自然也沒有什麼遊玩的內容。整個西南湖區方向玩的景點不多，個人感覺不必特意過來。

位置交通： 這個酒店位於文淵獅城古鎮內；從千島湖縣城開車約40分鐘（一定要自駕）；入住酒店還可以免了古鎮門票 

服務： 酒店會提前電話住客確認住客姓名；這樣就可以在住客到來前門口的紅燈籠上掛上姓氏；非常的有特色； 其次這裏也是可以帶狗狗一起來住的酒店；登記入住後；服務員小姐姐會送你到房間；還會幫你提行李； 非常的Nice，人美心善，感謝小姐姐！

房間設施： 酒店基本都是一棟一棟的徽派建築的房子；我們入住的是一棟樓的上下層；但設計的很奇妙；私密性非常的好；樓上根本看不到樓下；床基本都是大床；前面還有個塌；每個房間都配有浴缸；房間裏都是兩個洗漱台；這樣避免了早上搶洗漱台的問題；房間裏提供的浴衣也是很舒服的麻布；配套還有他們的一次性拖鞋也是麻布的；一樓的房間酒店還有提供除濕機；非常人性化；我們還在露台上看到美美的耶穌光[嘿哈][嘿哈][嘿哈]

推薦大家都來打打卡，放鬆一下心情，感受一下古鎮的文化氛圍，還有安逸與世隔絕的生活狀態。

PS：吃飯也很方便，外面就是小鎮，很有生活氣息

🔔服務：退房時，衹有一位工作人員在崗，與正在辦理開發票的客户閑聊，全然不顧等在後麪已有10分鐘的客人，毫無服務意識。其實，退房手續很簡單，衹要交鑰匙就行了，工作人員稍微注意一下後面的客人，就能避免客人的等待。另外，早餐9點左右就出現供應不足，很多空盤的場面，補貨非常慢，甚至覺得是故意不補貨。
總體來説，不符合4.7分的高分評價，不會推薦入住。退
🍃環境：酒店在文淵獅城景區裏，景區沒什麼人氣，快的話半小時就能逛完，不推薦特地過來。

msg:因為本來的行程變更所以臨時換了這家酒店，酒店地點有點偏，離千島湖景區開車大概一個小時左右。酒店整體環境不錯，但是養護有點問題，顯得有點破敗，綠化整體不錯。酒店在景區內，但是因為比較破敗沒什麼人，特別是晚上，有點嚇人，不敢單獨一人出門。早餐品種不多，以素為主，衹能吃個飽。酒店內沒有別的餐飲，要去主街上食用，宜福春口味蠻好，價格也不貴。中午叫了管家推薦的十八碗，但是送餐費要20元，比叫外賣還貴，感覺在餐飲方面酒店欠缺了點。服務麼大體上還可以，有求必應，衹是作為五星酒店的話，細節上還不行，希望多改進吧。

msg:酒店在千島湖環湖西線，從火車站自駕過去風景優美，沿途還有賣當地產水果的，一路開過去心曠神怡，雖然獅城景區非常落魄，但是酒店自身是非常好的，裏面有泳池和藏書閲讀的閣樓（閣樓上望出去窗外的風景相當不錯，可惜當天氣温很高，卻沒有開空調，實在坐不住），每間房子都是一棟雅緻的兩層徽式小樓，這個季節後院的荷花也綻放了，入住給人很多驚喜，門口掛姓氏燈籠也很有趣，提高了入住體驗感，而且晚上看到姓氏，不太容易走錯門，冰箱的飲料通通免費，送了水果，總之相當滿意，千島湖值得一逛的不是具體什麼景點，而是環湖沿途的風景，下次環湖，還會來你們家住

msg:聊聊我的入住體驗吧。這個價格的房間很寬敞，性價比還是可以的。預訂了四晚，第二天打掃衞生，更換的毛巾隨意堆放，給我的感覺不是很好；酒店地理位置比較偏，晚上晚飯後外面基本黑燈瞎火了；泳池開放到晚上九點關燈，停車場我看得到的地方好像都是露天的，這個季節過去很曬；這種庭院酒店晚上蚊蟲還是很多的，知了也很吵，尤其外面那間房間，隔音比較差。住了兩晚提前離店了，本來不同意退剩餘兩晚的房費，和酒店不斷溝通協商，酒店最後還是從我按金中扣下了500塊錢，有點不爽。本次入住體驗不是很好，希望能給其他遊客提供點意見，僅供參考。
