The buildings behind the hotel are very beautifully constructed and well maintained of about a hundred years old.  The staff are very polite and helpful especially the lady who helped us to check in at the front desk and the gentleman at the concierge who gave us information of the river cruise.  There are good restaurants there and the hotel facilities are very nice.  I will definitely go again if I go to Guangzhou again.

When taxi a taxi, young man helping us get the taxi held his hand above my head to make sure I don’t bump my head on the taxi door when getting into taxi. He didn’t know I was recovering from a brain surgery. This gesture was so kind and attentive. I was very moved by it. The room service was wonderful as well. All the staff were wonderful. So young but so well trained and attentive staff. Excellent English spoken as well on all levels.

msg:Given the high rating and reputation of this hotel, I was shocked by the conditions of the supposedly newly renovated rooms.  I was staying at the standard room on the twelve floor , facing the historical buildings.  We checked in after 10:30pm under the drizzles and chill -  the outside temperature was around 10 degress.

I noticed the holes of the linen of the blinds when they were rolled down, though it could still function.  Yet, the light shield was worse.  It was trapped on one side and could not be let down.  

The plus side was we were offered another room on the same floor immediately.  Leo who helped to bring our luggage up was very polite and patient. He stayed outside our room when his colleague brought the new key of the new room and accompanied us to the new room to ensure everything was all right.  He was worth 5 out of 5 for service.  However, I would further explain why I only gave 4 out of 5 for service. 

Yet,  the new room was smaller and for any other international hotels , from my experience, would offer an upgrade of the room.  This hotel did not.  Thats why I gave 4 out of 5 for service.

The linen of the blinds in the new room was still far from 100%.  I could still detect torn tissues , most probably because the blinds were dated.  Thats why I gave a 3 out of 5 for facilities.

Generally it was ok, but hope in futer room rate can be better.

The only drawback is that there are too many people. White Swan has become a popular tourist destination. There are many tourists, which indirectly affects the hotel's service to guests.

msg:The old hotel has a good location and good breakfast. But the facilities and services have fallen behind. In particular, the waiter, under the guise of giving away two cookies that were inexplicably unpalatable, was actually trying to sell this souvenir, knocking on the door indiscriminately to wake up sleeping guests, which made people feel that the old-style service was really old.

msg:The reservation was for a standard king bed (2412). Maybe it was nearly 10 years since the last renovation? The facilities are very dilapidated. It feels like a 3 star standard. The toilet and bathroom can be described as "shabby" in one word. The ventilation area of ​​the room is peeling and peeling. If you adjust the air volume to the maximum, it will be a bit noisy. The ceiling is patched and the colors are inconsistent. There is mold on the second floor of the fitness room. Isn’t it because fitness absorbs mold? The overall maintenance is really substandard👎. Very bad.

msg:The White Swan Hotel is the most representative five-star hotel in Guangzhou. It is the collective memory of countless Guangzhou people. It is a very sentimental hotel. It is located on the sand surface full of history, facing the White Swan Lake and having an unobstructed view of the river. The scenery is in full view. This time, I would like to thank the housekeeping manager Isaac for carefully arranging a river view room for me and also helping me book morning tea in Hongtu Mansion. The river view room has a spacious space of 60 square meters and is decorated in Cantonese-style Lingnan style. Sitting by the window, you can have a panoramic view of the beautiful scenery of Baietan and the newly completed Greater Bay Area Art Center opposite.
The hotel staff are all very enthusiastic and kind, and the overall stay experience is very good👍! I will definitely stay at White Swan Hotel again next time I come to Guangzhou.

The food at the buffet in the evening was of first-class quality, and the Chinese morning tea in the morning was an eye-opener for me. Every dim sum was made with care, like a work of art👍.

msg:I was not in a happy mood before checking in because the hotel was located in the scenic area of ​​Shamian Island. There was too much traffic during the holidays, so I had to walk a few hundred meters with my luggage to get there. Entering the hotel lobby, the landscape of Hometown Water attracts countless tourists to check in and take photos, making it very noisy. However, the following experience wiped away my dissatisfaction: the doorman took the initiative to help take the luggage, and the front desk checked in enthusiastically and efficiently. When you come to the guest room, you are shocked by the magnificent river view outside the floor-to-ceiling window. The room is spacious and well-equipped. There are also complimentary welcome fruits and delicious cookies, which makes you feel good. The hotel service staff were very friendly during the few days we stayed and responded to our needs in a timely manner. In addition, the hotel's restaurant and bakery are so delicious! After you have eaten and drank enough, you can also go for some exercise and enjoy the beautiful gymnasium with all the fitness equipment and facilities. The only drawback is that the bathtub is a bit narrow, which may make taller guests feel cramped. But in short, apart from the crowded lobby and the crowded road in the front area, it is still a very good resort hotel!

msg:The hotel is located in Shamian, very close to the old houses and embassy area in the Pearl River Scenic Area. The service of the whole hotel is relatively standardized to five-star standards, especially the toothbrush, which is very rare to have a soft-bristled brush. Many hotels have hard toothbrushes that can't be used at all. This service detail is very user-friendly.
In addition, the hotel has thoughtfully prepared a city roaming route map, a morning jogging route map, and hand-painted postcards for collection, which are very distinctive.
There are also snacks prepared in the evening, which are delicious from the Western Bakery.
These details reflect the hotel's service awareness for guests.
The overall room for this stay is relatively small, next to the staff's work, and the sound insulation is not good. In the early morning and late at night, you can always hear the sound of the door next door.

msg:Old hotel, not picky about other things, after all, the hardware can't be changed. It's quite convenient to take a boat during the Canton Fair. The only annoying thing is that I ran out of the Canton Fair yesterday afternoon and rushed to take a boat back to the hotel (there is only one boat every day). When I got on the boat, I was sweating and thirsty, so I asked the waiter for a bottle of hotel water. The waiter took the wine and beverage card and asked me what kind I wanted. I said that your hotel's mineral water would be fine. I was told that there was no water. I said that there was in the morning. The two waitresses replied, yes, there was in the morning, but not in the afternoon... My friends ordered a few drinks, and I asked for a glass of water. The male waiter turned around and brought me a bottle of hotel mineral water. I would like to ask the two waitresses who refused to give me mineral water before, did this bottle of water appear out of thin air? I don't want to kidnap morals, nor do I say that I can't afford it, but as a five-star hotel with an old brand, is it really good to force guests to consume in this disguised way?

I used to book here every time, but the trip was always cancelled and I never stayed there.
In fact, from the room pictures on Ctrip, you can see that it is worthy of being the first five-star hotel in China.
During holidays, there is no noise in the room, the bedding is very comfortable, and the bath water is very large, which is very comfortable. And the water in the bathtub should be added with disinfectants, it is very blue, so there should be no worries about disinfection, and there is no need to worry about sprinkling bath salts.
I stayed in Puli in Shanghai, 2200 a night, really want to say that this is it? Like a fast.
White Swan is really worthy of its name! From the lobby to the room, from morning tea to room facilities, there is no thunder. In the future, you will never have to choose thunder when you come to Guangzhou, there is no other choice.

However, the front desk staff did not fully introduce the hotel facilities and did not explain the breakfast location and time, because our breakfast was included in the hotel fee.
At another breakfast place, the service of the egg station staff was 10 points worse. I ordered a scrambled egg and an egg yolk, but he said there was no egg paste, so he just used regular eggs to fry them for me. In fact, adding more egg paste would be a waste. Time? There was also a staff member who didn't know how to make fried eggs. The fried fish eggs were added with green onions at the end. It was the first time I saw such an operation. Fortunately, other staff members came to find out when they saw that they were a little dissatisfied. However, it was not from me, but from that person. The staff understood and thought I didn't understand Mandarin, which made me feel very bad throughout the breakfast process. Moreover, the quality of the breakfast was very inconsistent. It is not recommended to have a buffet breakfast in this hotel.

msg:▪️Love [White Swan Hotel], I will choose to stay here without hesitation when I come to Guangzhou. There are many five-star hotels in Guangzhou, but there are chain stores in other cities. White Swan is unique and the only one in the country.
▪️China's first five-star hotel has an extremely advantageous location. It is located in the famous Shamian Scenic Area in the old city, facing the Pearl River and facing Baie Lake. The Liufu Pavilion Restaurant on the first floor and the Hongtu Mansion on the second floor both have river views. Traveling here is also very convenient. You can walk to Yongqingfang in more than 10 minutes, and you can walk to Renmin Bridge, Guangdong Customs and Xidi Pier in 7 or 8 minutes. Just outside is Shamian Island, which is full of small Western-style buildings.
▪️From the moment I checked in, I experienced the concept of White Swan putting guests first and service first. The people who received me were the front desk supervisor Xiao Rong and Zhou Qiting. They were really enthusiastic and patiently answered all kinds of questions. I also made every request in the future. Solve it for me, like it!
▪️The hotel recommends newly renovated room types. Last time I stayed in Deluxe City View Twin Room No. 2019. This time I asked the front desk to arrange a high-rise room for me. I stayed in Deluxe City View King Room No. 1924. The room area is 60 It is flat and has the same layout. Two huge lighting windows provide bright lighting in the room. The hardware facilities are complete. The double sink design is easy to use. The bedding is also made of high yarn, so you can have a comfortable sleep when you are tired from playing.
▪️The hotel has two doors. The east door is the main entrance. It is located on the second floor and is also where the hotel lobby is. There is an exclusive road leading up from the People's Bridge. The north door opens on the sand surface side. There is a sign at the door. The "White Swan" where many people come here to check in and take photos, and there is also the famous Saqima store [Gourmet House] at the north gate.
▪️An exclusive advantage of staying at the White Swan is that you can book the popular two-story Michelin-starred [Hongtu Mansion] and the third-floor Black Pearl [Yujiang Chunnuan] in advance, saving you the trouble of queuing up to get a reservation, even if you want to go there at last minute When dining, you can also go to the front desk of the restaurant to get your guest number and be seated first.
▪️In short, staying at White Swan is a five-star experience. I am very satisfied. I will still choose this hotel next time I come to Guangzhou.

msg:I am a person who suffers from hotel selection syndrome, so I have to evaluate it carefully and objectively! I wrote this review while sleeping in bed at two or three in the morning before I checked out of the hotel. I will post it later after I review it. There are good experiences and there are very bad ones. As the first five-star hotel in China, it has hosted many national leaders. It is said that the morning tea ceiling is here, so I came here because of its reputation. The geographical location is excellent, within walking distance to Shamian, Shangxiajiu Pedestrian Street and Yongqingfang. The deluxe river view room is large in size and has a beautiful river view during the day. There is almost no night view at night and the lighting is very bleak. The service attitudes of the front desk and security are very good (except Hongtu Mansion, which will be discussed in detail later). Switching from an elegant hotel with almost perfect experience, once you enter the lobby, it is indeed overcrowded because non-resident guests can enter. This is understandable. After all, there are several major gourmet restaurants inside, and the public area inside the hotel is very beautiful. Let’s talk about the two well-known signature restaurants [Hongtufu] and [Yutang Chunnuan] in detail: [Hongtufu] morning tea is open from 8:00 to 14:30. I arrived at 13:30 and was still in line for table 21 because I was staying at the hotel. Guests were seated in two minutes. The large hall was indeed full. I ordered shrimp dumplings, chicken feet, swan cakes, Shaqima, Tingzai porridge, and palace Pu'er tea. In terms of taste, Shaqima was worthy of its reputation; shrimp dumplings and There is no difference between the ones at Guangzhou Restaurant; the Tingzi porridge is just average; the swan cake is almost a must because it looks good and tastes good; the chicken feet basically meet expectations; the palace Pu'er tea is delicious. In terms of service: Very average, especially the tea makers. They help the guests make the soup and then pour the tea into the male cups, and then the guests pour the tea into the small cups themselves. Every time they add tea, I say thank you, but they don’t. Upon hearing any response, you can feel their numb expressions wearing masks. I have to pay 15% of the consumption as service fee (requirement), that’s it? At 20:15, I wasn’t hungry at all, so I went to check in at [Yutang Chunnuan]. The environment was good, there was a pretty pond inside, koi were fed and surrounded by flowers and plants. I only ordered braised squab and white braised goose palm wings. The squab was delicious, and the goose wings were good at first. The more you ate, the more it tasted like pickled pepper and chicken feet, and it was a bit salty. The overall attitude of the waiters is better than that of Hongtufu. There is a guzheng player with decent skills. The hotel is located within the flight coverage area, and the aircraft noise is obvious before 12 pm. At 3 am, the sound of gray aircraft piercing the night sky was actually heard. In addition, I live on the 16th floor. Before 12 o'clock in the evening, I could hear noisy chatter coming from the guest rooms or public areas below. The guests on the upper floor of my room were unwilling to take off their high heels even after 12 o'clock. He seems to be taking a walk in the room, and I don’t know if he ate too much. Let me talk about my worst experience, the sleeping experience: due to work reasons, I changed my flight to a very early flight and returned early. I usually go to bed late, so I went to bed at 0:10. At 2:10, I woke up from a nigh**are and finally woke up. Come here, let’s analyze the possibilities in several aspects. First, before booking the hotel, we noticed that the bed was placed in an unusual direction. It was placed facing the river, that is, facing the window. This is equivalent to having your feet facing the window when sleeping. In short, if you are taboo about this, don’t book a room with river view. Secondly, it is possible that you may not be able to sleep well if you eat too much before going to bed. Third, the air conditioner may be old and therefore noisy. Fourth, the temperature is difficult to control, the bedding seems not very breathable, my head and hands are exposed and I feel cold, my body is stuffy and sweaty in the quilt, and the pillow is uncomfortable. So I only slept for two hours and I didn't dare to sleep after I was woken up by a nigh**are. Hey, I had a good night's sleep at Yazhi last night, and I slept for 7.5 hours. After writing so much in confusion, every sentence is true and I hope it can be of reference value. I also hope that White Swan can make the good aspects better and better, and improve the relatively inadequate ones. I wish the hotel can become more and more brilliant.

Thanks to Manager Peng from the front office for being particularly enthusiastic in helping communicate and deal with room-related matters, making this stay a very pleasant experience. The quality and ability of the managers of the old classic five-star hotel are indeed trustworthy! The White Swan's morning tea can only be reserved by hotel guests, otherwise it may take a long time to wait in line. Many of my friends said that they did not queue up for the White Swan morning tea. They must come to the White Swan next time to experience the classic Cantonese morning tea a**osphere and a**osphere. gourmet food. Next to White Swan is Shamian, which is very suitable for walking, shopping, drinking coffee, and experiencing the blending of multiple cultures. The location of White Swan is also unique in Guangzhou, so that you can deeply feel the charm of Guangzhou. It is more recommended to stay at White Swan than the hotels in Zhujiang New Town. .

msg:The hotel has a good location, the environment and catering services are very good. But what I want to talk about in particular is the service issue during the Chinese New Year. I checked in on 2/7 and left around 17:15 on 2/8. I took a taxi from Dongmen to Chimelong Hotel.
When I set off, I brought two suitcases and a stroller with a bag on it. Two guys at the door helped put the luggage in the trunk of the taxi, but when I was approaching Chimelong, I found the stroller. The car and the bag were all at the east gate of the hotel where I boarded the car. I called the hotel switchboard and asked the front desk to contact the two guys outside to see if the car and bag were still there. This was my request. Three consecutive phone calls said they could help me. I went to see it, and the second call came back and asked me if I had seen it. I asked the switchboard to contact the switchboard again to confirm. And the time is provided. You and I left the store in ten minutes between 17:15 and 17:25. If possible, you can also check the door surveillance. There was no reply after the third call, and until now when I wrote the review, there was no reply.
Since I had two children at the time, one of whom was only 20 months old, I could only let my wife and the children stay in Chimelong first, and then I took a taxi from Chimelong back to the east gate of the White Swan Hotel. When the car and bag were picked up at the east gate of the hotel, the two boys told me that they had not received any message asking them to confirm the information of the trolley and bag, and no boss came to talk about it.

At this point, I am very unhappy. I chose the White Swan Hotel for the Chinese New Year. The service you provided is just repeated lies to the customer service. I still have important documents and computers in my bag. Think about it from my perspective. If you are the parties involved, How would you feel when you encounter such a situation? !

Based on the above experience, I give the hotel service a negative review, and believe that the hotel should receive a discount from the fees charged, because your deception and poor service make customers very dissatisfied.

In addition: the front desk of the hotel cannot help with taxis, and the doorman at the door is not responsible for stopping taxis and maintaining taxi order at the door. I have repeatedly asked the front desk and the doorman that this is the hotel's rule, and it is quite strange. Please ask the hotel management to confirm the regulations under the leadership of some wise man.

We hope the hotel can see the above objective reviews and give positive feedback.

The hotel upgraded me to a river-view king bed room for free, room number 808. I'm really happy.
        This time during my trip to Guangzhou, I went around a lot and changed several hotels. I saw the difference between good and bad hotels in Guangzhou and the unique musty smell in the rooms. I couldn't book a room for the middle of the day, so I thought of the White Swan where I took the old man to live in Guangzhou last time. The room was extremely clean and elegant. The entire hotel environment and dining are very comfortable. I originally planned to try another hotel, but my daughter was afraid of the musty smell in the room and still liked the White Swan. Sure enough, White Swan will not disappoint. Comfortable and clean. It is convenient to travel, and it is comfortable and comfortable to walk around during the day and night. Morning tea, buffet, Cantonese and Sichuan dishes are all good. Next time I come to Guangzhou, I will continue to choose White Swan.
       Another point is that White Swan charges a deposit when checking in, but among the hotels in Guangzhou I stayed at this time, the deposit was refunded the fastest. satisfy.

msg:The room was great overall, but it was too popular and I didn't book a river view. The experience this time was really not as good as in previous years. The hotel lobby has turned into a tourist attraction, with so many people like a vegetable market. There is no sense of experience, which leads to queues for morning tea. There are too many, and guests do not have the advantage of making reservations, so it is not perfect to stay again. Fortunately, the hotel service and sanitation are very good, so I can save a little bit. If the next time I come is a holiday, I really don’t recommend it. There are more good choices. If it is during normal times, I highly recommend it. After all, it is the first foreign-related hotel after China’s opening up. You can still come and experience the hotel.

1. The ventilation in the hotel lobby is very poor. The smell of cooking fumes from the restaurant kitchen reaches the lobby. The air is very poor and uncomfortable.

2. The room is extremely old and the bathroom is extremely small. There is no shower room. You have to take a bath in the bathtub and use a shower curtain.

3. The sound insulation is very poor. You can clearly hear what is said in the corridor, upstairs and next door.

4. There is a lot of noise. You can hear noise from various devices in the middle of the night.

5. Yutang Chunnuan is also disappointing. It is not as good as the experience before the epidemic. Every table has fried barbecued pork, and the ventilation is poor. It feels very uncomfortable to sit inside.

Compared with the five-star hotel near Huacheng Square where I stayed yesterday, the White Swan's facilities are relatively lagging behind. But after all, it is an old five-star hotel building with a rich history. We stay in it more because of our feelings.
The sense of history of the White Swan can be gleaned from the layout and decoration of its lobby. The green mountains, waterfalls and flowing water, as well as the exhibits displayed in the corridors, can make people return to peace from the hustle and bustle of the city.
The room is not big and the air conditioner is noisy, but the lights outside the window are dim at night.

When the door opened and closed, I put my luggage down and opened the door, and then I went to get the luggage and the door closed again, so this aspect can be optimized.

For this kind of room, at least mention it when checking in, or there are two basic room types by default, so just make it clear on the booking page, otherwise it doesn't matter?

There is almost no night view of the Pearl River in this section, and you can’t see much at night. The hotel is obviously not close to the airport, but there is a very loud sound of planes flying overhead. I found out that it is on the flight path of Baiyun Airport. It was so noisy that I couldn't sleep all night.

The service attitude of the hotel staff was average. Everything I encountered from check-in to the road was procedural and not enthusiastic at all. When I checked in at four or five in the afternoon, the staff stopped me at the counter and asked me about it on a very cold day. Do you want to store your luggage? Why store your luggage? Want to go shopping for Shamian noodles by the Pearl River in Wudu? I said I had to check in. It's five o'clock. Isn't the room cleaned and ready yet? The other party didn't respond to me.

I called two days in advance to make an appoin**ent at Yutang Chunnuan. I don’t know why the operator told me that I could only make an appoin**ent at Hongtu Mansion during my stay. I thought it was not open for business, but when I checked in, I found that it was open as usual. I didn’t understand this operation?

The passenger traffic is probably at its peak during the winter vacation. The quality is average, but for an old five-star hotel, it is actually of this level and has a lot to offer.

The waiters at the front desk and restaurant are all the same. They are slow to pay the bill and slow to find luggage. They asked the waiter to help me get off the elevator and asked me to go to the front desk by myself. Now this is the case The service is really bad!
The White Swan morning tea is not amazing either, and the price/performance ratio is low!

The hotel service is good. What impressed me most was the front desk lady named Feng, who arranged a nice room for me and introduced me to the surrounding tourist attractions. I gained a lot from her professional knowledge. It can be seen that the management level of White Swan is still good. Because of her, she will choose to come to White Swan next time🦢

The design of the hotel is beautiful and does not look dated even after all these years. In particular, the small bridge and waterfall in the hotel lobby are unique and are iconic spots that everyone wants to take pictures of. The room seems to have been renovated and the facilities are good. Particular praise is given to the service. From check-in to the hotel's buffet breakfast, the staff I encountered were the kind who have stayed at a five-star hotel so far. Maybe because it's not a weekend or a holiday, I didn't feel there were too many people. Several famous restaurants in the hotel only have temporary reservations for flavor restaurants, and the environment is first-class and the taste is good.

What needs to be noted is: I booked a standard king bed room. When I arrived at the hotel, the front desk said that this kind of basic room was all head and tail rooms in the hotel.
The hotel room is very good, the view is unparalleled, the room is luxuriously decorated, and the facilities are advanced
The service attitude of the waiters at various stations is very good! Small problems can be solved in time and communication is smooth.
However, Yutang Chunnuan advises not to eat it, it’s just so-so.
Hongtufu morning tea is recommended with 10 points, it’s so delicious! But you must make a reservation in advance, otherwise you won’t be able to eat on the same day.

You must also say a few honest words about the shortcomings. Question 1: We checked in the room at the front desk at 1:30, but it took more than two hours of cleaning before we could check in. No matter how good the business is, the efficiency cannot be so low! This is the first time I have encountered this situation after traveling to more than 50 countries around the world. Of course, we were arranged for a late check-out as compensation. Question 2: Why do you feel that the waiters at the lobby tea bar and so on are a bit cold and not very good at smiling? The software needs to be improved! This is my personal experience after traveling in China for nearly 110 days this year and staying in no less than 50 hotels!
It can’t be that after 40 years, the hotel hardware has not lost, but it has lost to the software!

msg:The White Swan Hotel is the first five-star hotel in China's reform and opening up. It is located on Shamian Island. It has a great location. You can take a walk around the island to see the historical buildings of Shamian and taste the surrounding food. As the Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day holiday approaches, bring your children over to eat, drink and have fun together, and enjoy an independent, fast and convenient check-in mode in the executive lounge on the third floor that day. The beautiful lady at the front desk, Jessica, has a kind attitude, sweet smile, and skilled work. When she learned that there were children, she even gave her a small backpack and exclusive toiletries. The hotel's attentive service was really good! The river view room has a beautiful panoramic view, comfortable and cozy. A box of mooncakes and fruits will be given as a gift upon check-in. The room is hygienic and clean, the bedding is neat and comfortable, the cleaning lady works carefully and has a good attitude. When there are children, she will give two extra bottles of water. During your stay, you can enjoy executive lounge privileges, including breakfast, afternoon tea, cocktails, etc. Xiaolin beauty provides warm service and introduces various snacks, food and drinks. In the evening, the child asked to go swimming and wanted to have some fried noodles to take a rest, but the noodles happened to be gone. Huang H.M., the handsome man, learned about it. Follow up quickly to help deal with it, the service is very considerate and thumbs up! The swimming pool has a good environment and complete facilities. The children had a great time and said they would come again next time. Because I made an appoin**ent with my friends for dinner at Yutang Chunnuan Restaurant in the evening. After checking out in the afternoon, there was still more than an hour before dinner. I took a rest in the executive lounge. Jadyn, a handsome guy, brought me a drink and the service was very attentive. It was a great stay.

There are few parking spaces and long queues. The trams cannot be charged. Many are obviously summer interns and the service is not in place. 2 o'clock Check-in and check-out are strict at 12 o'clock. If you exceed the time limit, half a day's room fee will be added. The internal hotel Yutang Chunnuan is even more outrageous. During the meal, the waiter interrupted when serving food and the speed of serving food was extremely slow. In every aspect, it is not worthy of being the oldest hotel in Guangzhou. I usually don't comment on the name of a five-star hotel. I came here specifically for an engagement party during the National Day. I was very disappointed and will not come again in the future.

It is not easy to walk up and down the stairs with your luggage! We booked a deluxe city view room. As soon as we entered the room, we could smell the pleasant aroma. The room was very large, and the large bed faced the large floor-to-ceiling glass windows. The view was superb, and we could see the buildings from all over the world on Shamian Island. The room is well-equipped and tidy. The cloakroom is connected to the bathroom, which takes up half of the room. The bathtub is equipped with a TV. You can watch TV while taking a bath (bath salts are provided). It is very enjoyable. When we came back after dinner out, we found that there was an extra cookie tea on the table, the slightly messy room had been tidied up, and tea bags were added to us, which was very considerate and thoughtful. The only drawback is that when we checked in, we asked the front desk clerk to book Hongtufu morning tea for us the next day, but he asked us to call and book it ourselves from the room. I think this is not the service attitude that a five-star hotel should have. Besides, There were no other residents requiring his services at the time. I hope the hotel can improve this small service!

Because I was traveling with my parents and children during the summer vacation, I originally booked 2 rooms. When I checked in at the front desk, the hotel staff learned about the actual situation and offered to help me change a connected room. People's journey under one roof becomes more enjoyable. In addition to hotel accommodation in Guangzhou White Swan, the hotel’s meals are also the goal of our trip. Fortunately, Yutang Chunnuan, Hongtu Mansion, and Buffet Breakfast Liufu Pavilion have all been experienced one by one. Exquisite Cantonese cuisine, authentic morning tea, and a sumptuous breakfast that combines Chinese and Western cuisine satisfy the whole family. The White Swan Hotel also has its own excellent treasures, one is the hotel history showroom, which is definitely a must-see place for family outings. You can learn about the past and present of China's first five-star hotel and feel China at the same time. The historical a**osphere of reform and opening up is worth seeing. The other is the excellent location of the White Swan Hotel. It is within walking distance to Shamian Island, the representative place of old Guangzhou architecture. As the epitome of Guangzhou, it is worth spending half a day walking around. Of course, there are many online celebrity shops You can go experience it and take some travel photos to leave some memories of Guangzhou for your family. This is also a very good choice! In addition to Shamian Island, the surrounding Sacred Heart Cathedral, Chen Clan Ancestral Hall, Yongqingfang, Shangxiajiu Pedestrian Street... are all within 20 minutes' walk, which is very convenient. If you want to feel the charm of old Guangzhou, choose White Swan Hotel Guangzhou, you will never be disappointed! Special reminder: Tangshui in Guangzhou is of course not to be missed. In order to avoid queuing in the hot summer vacation, Nanxin Tangshui can be delivered directly to the hotel. Enjoying the river view and tasting Tangshui is definitely fun for the whole family during the trip!

The bad reviews reflect the service, which affects the whole impression. I originally went there because of the White Swan morning tea, but I didn't expect that the process was not happy.

I made a reservation for Yutang Chunnuan's morning tea the day before. When I went to the restaurant at 11:30, there was only one receptionist wearing glasses and she was on the phone, so I stood in front of her and waited. This person obviously saw me and didn't give any sign. He was immersed in the phone. At this time, another customer came. After making the call, the service staff first looked up at me. Just as I was about to speak, the customer actually passed me who had been waiting for a while in front of her and greeted the person next to me. The customer, who had obviously just arrived, was led into the restaurant. Leaving me messy in the wind.
I just don’t understand. Even a person as big as me can’t see this person, or what does it mean? If I don't take it personally, I can only blame it on the hotel's poor service training and I was offended.

There are so many people in Yutang Chunnuan, but hotel guests don't need to wait in line. Although the price is a little expensive, it is worth the money. Although I haven't eaten sweets for a long time, the dessert shop on the first floor is worth visiting, and the bread starts to be discounted after 8 o'clock in the evening. In short, there is nothing wrong with choosing White Swan.

The hotel service is great, the front desk reception is very polite, and the room attendants are professional and serious.
The rooms are uniquely designed and every little detail impresses. The comfort of the river view room is perfect. The design of the room fully shows the river view. Sitting anywhere in the house can have a panoramic view of the river view.
The hotel is located on Shamian Island. You can visit various European-style buildings when you go out. When you are tired, you can rest in the Tiffany blue Starbucks.
Very good hotel, will stay in Guangzhou in the future

We booked a river view room, where you can have a panoramic view of the river. It is comfortable and cozy. I slept until I woke up naturally every day, and the children had a great time. The hotel lobby can be opened to the outside world, so there will be more people, and it is relatively not so quiet. Guests staying at Yutang Chunnuan also have to line up on the spot, but the number can be given priority. The taste of the food is not bad. We had breakfast in the executive lounge and Liufu Pavilion for two days respectively. Although the executive lounge is only simple western style, and the dishes are not as many as Liufu Pavilion, I personally prefer the quietness and elegance of the executive lounge. The overall stay experience is very good, and the children had a great time.

From the moment you check in, you can feel that the hotel service is in place. Even if there are many people and cars at the gate, there will be a waiter to help you open the door and take your luggage, and help you register your luggage while checking in. The hotel room is also very large, with a particularly good view, and the bathtub is also equipped with a separate TV (it is even more unexpected to be able to watch hbo).
Guests can directly reserve the morning tea at Hongtufu. Hongtufu is really delicious. You must try Shaqima and lychee jelly!
I still want to live in the White Swan next time, or I can say that I want to go to Guangzhou again for the White Swan.

There are landscape paintings in the room, as well as a thick album of historical stories about the White Swan, White Swan Lake, and the Pearl River. For a family like me who travels with children, it is undoubtedly a good environment and material for cultivating children to feel and understand Guangzhou. The river view in the bathtub is very good, and the bath salt and body lotion are all customized by White Swan, so you can use them with confidence. The oversized floor-to-ceiling windows, watching the boats passing by, and the starlight on both sides of the Pearl River, is really decompressing. And fast check-out, extra bed light service is very quick, curtain lighting toilet is very smart, capsule coffee machine, living experience is very modern. In my opinion, it will be significantly better than Hilton, and I recommend mothers with babies to live here.

You can check in directly on the 3rd floor for the executive room. There are fewer people checking out, which is fast and convenient. All the hotel staff in the executive lounge are very polite and enthusiastic, even the interns are very attentive and hardworking to serve the guests.
Hygiene: very clean and bright.
Environment: I originally booked an executive river view room, which helped us upgrade the executive suite. It is large and refined. Whether it is the floor-to-ceiling windows for viewing the view, the interval between the washrooms, and the pool, they are arranged in a reasonable way. My favorite is the window. There is a charging station next to the recliner. If you are tired from playing outside, your mobile phone will run out of battery, so you can charge and swipe your mobile phone while watching the scenery.
Facilities: Complete, basically everything you can think of. There are many dining options in the evening. The Napoleon of the executive lounge afternoon set menu is more delicious, the environment is good, and good photos can be taken by the window.
Breakfast: The only imperfection is that there was a group on the day of our check-in. There were too many people at the buffet breakfast in the lobby on the first floor. I went to the first floor and saw the situation and went back to the executive lounge. I told the intern who received us about the situation. The younger sister immediately responded to the manager. Their manager asked us to stay in the executive lounge for breakfast and was very serious. Regarding the waiter matter, let us fill out the suggestion form and say that we will deal with it immediately. I really want to give this a thumbs up. When I encountered a problem in the hotel I stayed in Tianhe before, I either explained it or turned around to indicate that it was the problem of the guest. This makes me feel that our own five-star hotel is the one that cares about its guests. The breakfast in the executive lounge basically has everything except soup, noodles and noodles.

Environment: Booked a river view room, you can see the view of the Pearl River, with a wide view, very beautiful. The location of the hotel is in Shamian, and you can visit it when you leave the hotel.

Service: The service is very good, proactive and enthusiastic. I have tried three restaurants, and the morning tea is so delicious. I left a T-shirt when I left the hotel, and the housekeeping depar**ent helped to find it, thank you.

msg:Let me talk about the advantages first: the scenery is first-class! The decoration and layout of the room are very satisfactory, and the room with river view is large enough. The doormen, porters, afternoon tea staff, and room cleaning staff all have a good attitude and sense of service! The entire hotel has complete facilities, and the surrounding environment is also beautiful. If you don't want to go out for a stroll, you can spend a few days in the hotel. The taste of morning tea in Hongtu Mansion is indeed the ceiling of morning tea, super value! Moreover, the child wanted to drink hot milk, and a male employee in the restaurant quickly brought milk from another restaurant. I went to the bakery because I wanted to buy Shaqima, Napoleon, etc., and the product and service experience was also good. I passed by the closed bakery at night and saw the staff cleaning and disinfecting very carefully, and I immediately felt at ease.
Dissatisfied: The check-in at the front desk was very, very slow. When the family room could not be arranged on the same floor and the twin room could not be arranged, I asked if I could upgrade one of the room types, but the front desk lied to me: "Upgrade to one level It’s just a suite, and the price difference is too big, so I can’t upgrade.” I asked if there is an executive river view? I was reluctantly upgraded to an executive river view room, but I found out afterwards that the upgraded room type does not allow you to enjoy the executive lounge (in fact, I may not have the time or interest to go to the executive lounge, but I think it is too stingy!). The next day I bought a buffet at the hotel. I felt that the quality of the buffet did not match that of the hotel. The yogurt was especially unpalatable (although it was served in a pudding bottle, it tasted like cheap commercial yogurt). The cafeteria staff are full of enthusiasm for foreigners, and they also find it funny to treat compatriots with cold faces. If there is no comparison, they will think that the buffet staff are collectively cold-mouthed and cold-faced. And the employees in the cafeteria will not take a step back when they "encounter" with the guests, but wait for us to make way for them... Don't you train them? The smart toilet in the room is equipped with a semi-automatic toilet cover, which is fine, but the noise of the toilet is really loud, and it takes a long time for the sound of water and equipment to stop.
The flaws are not hidden, if you come to Guangzhou next time, you may still book here. I hope that the overall service awareness and level will be highly consistent at that time!

msg:White Swan is a place that has special meaning to me. Especially the river view and food. Booked an executive suite this time. Very satisfied with the service in the executive lounge. The team led by the manager Peng Shuaixian is extremely professional, enthusiastic and in place. Children want to eat snacks during non-afternoon tea time, they specially pack butter cookies and chocolates for children. Whether you invite guests to eat executive light meals, or to drink afternoon tea and enjoy English-style high tea, it is both face-saving and delicious! However, the room service and design have a lot to criticize. For example, it is not always easy to find the position of the switch. In the suite, the place where the large space is located is small, but a lot of space is wasted and cannot be used. The place to place bath towels is inconvenient and unsafe. There is also no hot water for bathing. Even after calling the waiter, there was still no hot water. Make my meeting VIPs wait for me for a long time, because I can't go out without taking a shower. Fortunately, Manager Peng Shuaixian and Manager Wu helped me to recover, which made my VIP resolve the unhappiness. Manager Peng, who needs to know next time, said that he can help to drink tea and rank, so that the experience will be better. Thank you Manager Wu and Manager Peng Shuaixian. Let me leave with good memories. Would love to come back to this special and wonderful place again!

msg:1. My wife and I pushed our way into the hotel door. We walked left and right without any hotel staff to help us. We finally found someone to find out that the hotel lobby was on the second floor.
2. After registering, I went to the tenth floor room, which was smaller than expected. There is a piece of fogged glass in the bathroom and a small bathtub. There are many black spots (mold) on the glass side and the glass glue on the side of the bathtub.
3. After settling in, my wife went to the restroom, but after finishing the restroom, the smell lingered as if there was no ventilation. When she opened the restroom door, the whole room smelled so she immediately asked to change rooms.
4. After moving from the 10th floor to the 9th floor, the black spots and ventilation in the bathroom have not improved, so in the remaining few days if we need to use the bathroom, we have to go to the public toilet in the hotel outside the room!
5. At 2:30 pm the next day, the hotel called me and asked me if I had not checked out yet. Do I want to renew my lease? I told the female staff member on the phone that I had rented it for three nights and asked her to check. She asked me if I had a check-in voucher and if I could send it to her via WeChat. I said it’s inconvenient on the street right now. Do I need to come back right away to deal with it? She said "best, best"
6. Back to the hotel lobby, after some manipulation, they told me that my reservation was divided into two tickets; they were 2-3/12 and 3-5/12, so this happened! This question needs to be answered by ctrip!
7. At 11pm, turn off the lights and prepare to rest. When you calm down, you will notice that a plane passes over the hotel in about five minutes; it is better after 2 o'clock in the morning, and it takes about ten or twenty minutes for a plane to fly over!
8. The planes pass by intermittently, and the sound of the air conditioner in the room will accompany you all night. Basically, we all fall asleep when we are very tired at 4 or 5 o'clock!
9. Maybe we are more sensitive to sounds and smells, but this is all our personal experience! There are many reviews saying how good the food at this hotel is. My wife and I have no intention of spending another dime at this hotel! When drinking tea, you will take two extra steps to get to Yongsheng. Not only five-star hotels cost over a thousand yuan, there are many choices in Guangzhou!
10. My wife laughed and asked whether she would have to stay in the Nixon or Queen’s rooms to truly experience the White Swan’s standards.

Tasty is another matter, but it's just chicken, and you charge 368 yuan for half? The breakfast buffet gave me the feeling that I couldn't start with it. There were few varieties. There was no raw porridge and steamed chicken feet in Guangzhou. Is it a long time? Anyway, I won't go again, and I don't recommend anyone around me to go! Whoever has the money can burn it.

The following is a brief dry goods, for other friends to check in for reference.
1. The turnstile at the back of the first floor of the hotel is Shamian, which is convenient for travel.
2. The flavor restaurant on the 3rd floor of the hotel is not recommended personally. Dinner meals are not cost-effective. The same Shaqima, the taste is quite different from Yutang Chunnuan, and the price here is one piece instead of one.
3. Yutang Chunnuan on the 3rd floor of the hotel is very good, but it is best to call and book a few days in advance to avoid waiting for a long time. There is a 10% discount for hotel guests.
4. The hotel is about 4 kilometers away from Tianzi Wharf. If you have a night cruise on the Pearl River, you can choose to start from this wharf.

After we arrived in Guangzhou, we went to the Pearl River Night Cruise, and we didn’t check in until 9 pm. Thank you very much, Ms. Qin Xiaochai, the manager on duty at the front desk, She saw that I brought an old man and a child with me, and immediately upgraded me to an executive sea view suite (I originally booked a city view room for two nights), and also helped me handle the late check-out service, and answered many of our questions patiently and meticulously. Tell the hotel about the use and location of various facilities, the fun and delicious food around, the hotel's catering situation and how to make a reservation, and considerately presented fruits, snacks and children's toilet sets. Very professional, qualified, good image, and enthusiastic The hotel staff deserves praise.
After arriving at our room on the 21st floor, we were attracted by the invincible river view and the night view of Guangzhou. Guangzhou is so beautiful! The room facilities are very high-end, clean, user-friendly, modern, coffee machine, electric curtains, smart toilet, oversized bathtub, and meticulous and patient butler service, etc. I stayed for three days and two nights, and the elderly and children didn’t want to leave.

The hotel's catering is also very good. We went to Hongtu Mansion on the second floor of the hotel and Yutang Chunnuan on the third floor for two consecutive days. Antique, delicious food and beautiful scenery.
We also went to the back garden of the hotel to take our children to swim in the hotel's outdoor infinity pool. It was a little cold on May Day, but the scenery was pleasant and very comfortable.
Very good staying experience, I will definitely come back next time!

The breakfast is more than 500 for a family of three. The price/performance ratio is very poor. There is basically nothing delicious.

What left a deep impression on us was the very good service attitude of the front desk staff, especially Comrade Liu Yu, who gave us a detailed introduction to the location of the hotel and helped us book a seat for morning tea in Hongtu Mansion. It is an ordinary standard room. Considering that we are relatively old, we are afraid that it will be inconvenient for us, so we have been upgraded to a deluxe river view room for free. The White Swan Hotel has brought our trip to Guangdong to a successful conclusion. Next time I come to Guangzhou, I still choose to live in White Swan!

Pros: very attentive staff, they speak English, but not all.
Lovely silky linens, comfortable bed
there was a shuttle to the exhibition
about the cons:
Terrible audibility between rooms
Read about the location of the hotel - located in a very beautiful colonial area, but the choice of where to eat within a 10-15 minute radius is small. Breakfast is typically Chinese, so here, too, without illusions, the coffee is tasteless.
But most of all I didn’t like the yellow walls of the room - like in a hospital ward :)

It was almost three o'clock when I arrived at the hotel, and the room hadn't been cleaned yet. I was quite disappointed. The room facilities are okay, but the TV background wall blocks a large area of windows facing the river. This layout is really problematic. Such a large area facing the river is wasted. In addition, living on the 7th floor, which is relatively low, the overall feeling is a bit lacking. Other aspects are not bad. I had morning tea in Hongtu Mansion. It was good, but it was a bit expensive.

msg:The 40-year-old hotel still retains a considerable standard! The reason why I chose this store is because my dream came true. However, it can be seen from the waiter training that some of the employees who are on duty are relatively temporary. For example, in the lobby bar, the staff do not understand foreign languages. During the morning tea, the old employees taught the employees to set up the table on the spot. The waiter at the entrance of Tao Taoting didn't know how to spend money inside, so he called an old employee to come out to answer my question. By the way, the 40-year commemorative device placed in the water in front of my hometown is relatively low. There are many ways to commemorate. There is also a big nightclub on the second floor, which is rented out? Furthermore, some rooms have coffee machines and some do not, which is not very good.

The worst part is the breakfast, 288 people don’t have anything, the coffee is like washing pot water, and I don’t know how to match it with a milk pot.

msg:On the last day of my stay in Guangzhou, I chose the White Swan Hotel. In summary, it is highly recommended, especially for couples, friends, and young people like me traveling.
I only considered White Swan because I was visiting Liwan. Before I checked in, I was always worried about the outdated facilities and poor experience, but it was actually completely ok.
Overall: Compared with the magnificent and oriental culture, I think White Swan has really achieved Chinese aesthetics and cultural heritage. The entire hotel has a layout of Lingnan landscape gardens as soon as you enter the door. There are three floors up and down the lobby. Check-in is on the second floor. The third floor is mainly a restaurant. It has the feel of a resort hotel. The door on the first floor is Shamian Island, and the location is invincible.
The sandalwood tones, humanistic picture books, and paintings that can be seen everywhere in the guest rooms all make people feel the hotel's intentions in the layout. The view is wide, and the whole room is bright and a**ospheric. The toilet is also an automatic toilet. In contrast, the brand of hair dryer and toiletries is a bit broken, and it is really not like a five-star hotel.
Meals: The hotel has Hongtufu, the number one morning tea restaurant in Guangzhou. We ordered takeaways to take back to the room to eat, avoiding long queues. For dinner, I chose Jin Yu Man Tang on the third floor, and went to Yu Nian Hua to drink cocktails and watch performances. The food part may have really raised the expectations too high, but I think it’s okay, the char siew buns are not bad, and there is nothing particularly amazing about the others. The bar recommends the Hawthorn Water Love Cocktail, which is delicious.
Service: Compared with the hotel environment, the service is really average. Chris in the lobby is very nice. He should be the manager of the lobby or the person in charge of the concierge depar**ent. He has customers in his eyes, and he will ask when he sees the wait, and his attitude is serious and responsible.
The check-in speed is extremely slow, there are obviously not many people, but the queue is almost 20 minutes. What I am most dissatisfied with this time is the restaurant service of Jinyu Mantang, which is basically equivalent to no service. I don’t understand what the service fee is for. I feel that the management still needs to strengthen the basic training.
Although the service is mediocre, the flaws are not hidden, and I can fully feel the culture of Guangzhou after living here for just two days. Next time I have a chance, I will bring my parents to play again!

I booked the most basic room type for 1 night on Ctrip, and later booked a 2-night luxury city view room type on other platforms. When I checked in, the front desk staff told me very sorry, because it was Sunday and the Lantern Festival, and the luxury city view rooms were full, so there was no way to help me upgrade the first night to the same room type, so please trouble me for the second Another day to change the room. In fact, it is normal not to upgrade, but the hotel is sorry for this. I think the service is from the heart, not a perfunctory routine. The room has been changed today, and the hotel actively upgraded the 2-night luxury city view to river view. I traveled with my father. The old man is in his seventies and is very happy. Thank you White Swan for your thoughtful service. I have lived in Carlton, Mandarin Oriental, and Four Seasons in Guangzhou. I think I have a say in the service. In comparison, the service of White Swan is really the best, with 40 years of precipitation and accumulation, it is worth experiencing.

Because it is still during the Spring Festival, there is still a lot of traffic, the room is spacious and bright, and the beautiful scenery of the yellow sand and sand surface outside the house is also unobstructed. I believe it will be better if you look at the river view. bed operation. Residents do not have any preferential trea**ent for dining in Hongtu Mansion, a little disappointed😞

msg:I really like the style of White Swan with strong Chinese classical cultural elements. The decoration materials are solid and attractive, and the swivel chair is spacious and comfortable.
The hair dryer has a strong wind, and it will dry your hair in a while. There are two washbasins, the location is wide, the shower head of the shower is strong and the water is fast, and the temperature of the hot water is sufficient.
The river view room has a first-class view. Thanks to the front desk for helping me upgrade to a river view room on a higher floor. It's a pity that the weather was gloomy and rainy, and we couldn't see the usually beautiful river view. Hope to see you again next time.
The most famous restaurant is Yutang Chunnuan. It is hard to find a guest, and guests staying in the hotel can make priority reservations. The restaurant is very beautiful, and half of the meal fee should be to experience a typical case of traditional Lingnan architectural decoration.
The staff throughout the hotel are friendly without being overly professional.
Going out from the north gate on the first floor is Shamian, which is very convenient for shopping. To walk out of Shamian Island, you have to walk over a pedestrian bridge.
Thank you White Swan staff for your care, I would like to stay here again next time I come to Guangzhou!

The renewal room card was invalid and I was locked outside and couldn't get in. I had to activate it again at the front desk and swipe the card at the swimming pool. If you can't get in, I'll ask if you are embarrassed. Nothing like this happens in Rujia Hanting. The water pressure in the shower is at least half that of my home. Is it difficult to get a supercharged shower? The water flow in the shower is extremely uncomfortable. , I had a meal in a five-star hotel and was informed that the outside was fully booked, and there was hair in the coffee cup. What kind of messy service is this? Although everyone has a good attitude, doing things well is the prerequisite. Just admitting your mistakes is Doesn’t it also fall short of the standards of a five-star hotel? Except for the environment, there is really no way to give it a high score.

I booked a standard room, and I made up for the price difference and upgraded it to see the river view, which is great value for money! The room is clean and bright. The blue sky and white clouds are reflected on the river. Don't feel too comfortable! The waiters at the front desk and the room are very polite and kind!

Every time you enter the room, you will smell the uncomfortable smell that affects your mood. There is a board above the faucet in the bathroom, and there is a layer of dust on it.

All tourist friends, if you come for morning tea, you don’t have to come to White Swan. The 780 morning tea costs only 100 service fees. To experience the real morning tea culture, go directly to Lei Garden and Bideliao. Better service and better service. Dishes. Not to mention friends in Shenzhen, if they go directly to Yuejing, they will beat the white swan.

I went there for the old five-star hotel and morning tea. I was really out of my mind. I spent more than 2,000 and was scolded by the hotel staff. They even threatened to do something to me. I really don’t know how to describe their low quality. The day before, I was told that I could go out if I reported my room number. Today I reported my room number but I couldn't get out. Even after I got the parking ticket from the concierge, I still couldn't get out. They also said that if you don’t understand the rules, you shouldn’t park. I really don’t know why everyone in this hotel is so arrogant. I told the lobby staff that I wanted to make a formal complaint. No one responded to my request or apologized. The reason was that the security guard He was still underage, and he was very angry and could not apologize to me. He hoped that I would understand.

If it is about service, there is no service here at all. If you have any needs, you can only be obedient. Talking loudly is absolutely disrespectful to them. If they don't hit you, they are already very kind to you. The same old brand can choose the Garden Hotel. Five-star choices include Ritz, Marriott, Four Seasons, and even Hampton by Hilton, all of which are more professional than White Swan. In short, White Swan is no longer worthy of its name. I have stayed at so many five-star hotels but they have no service or professionalism at all. They are destroying their brand! Definitely won't come here a second time! !

Visitors can come in to see the water in the hometown and appreciate the well-maintained green plants and koi. The swimming pool that needs to be swiped to enter gives a very tropical feeling, and the weather in Guangzhou is hot, so I am willing to soak in the swimming pool all the time in the morning. Go out the north gate and walk two steps to Shamian Street, a whole street of European buildings. It's very beautiful to take pictures and punch cards. It's the first time to choose this place in Guangzhou. It feels like a home away from home, and young friends will definitely like it~

There is still water in front of the revolving door in the lobby on the 2nd floor. No one paid attention, no one cleaned up, and no attention signs were set up.

To verify the situation, please check the monitoring around 2:00 pm on October 4, 2022.

It is particularly worth mentioning that the air conditioning system is much quieter than most hotels of the same level, and the temperature control is accurate, which is conducive to sleep.
Of course, the software performance is more commendable.
From check-in to check-out, the staff I met performed well, especially the staff in the executive lounge, who were enthusiastic and professional.
Also, the room service staff on the 23rd floor is also very nice.
The Yutang Chunnuan restaurant in the hotel is well-deserved, and several signature dishes are quite standard.
The breakfast is indeed relatively weak. There are many people in the restaurant on the first floor and there are fewer food varieties, which does not match the rest of the hotel. Fortunately, the food quality is still on the line. After going to the first floor once, we chose to have breakfast in the executive lounge on the third floor for the next few days. Although there are fewer varieties, the difference is not too big, and the environment is much better. There are few dining guests, which is quiet and convenient.
During the stay, it was my wife's birthday, and the hotel took the initiative to provide exquisite cakes and handwritten greeting cards to the room, which made people feel very warm.

White Swan Hotel is located in White Swan Pond, Shamian, Guangzhou City, Guangdong Province. It was invested and constructed by Mr. Huo Yingdong and the People's Government of Guangdong Province. It was jointly designed by the famous Chinese architectural design masters She Fannan and Mo Bozhi. China's first Sino-foreign cooperative five-star hotel.

🚖Transportation:
The hotel is located in Shamian Bai Swan Pond, which is said to be reclaimed from the sea. It is an independent building with very convenient transportation.

🏠Facilities:
The facilities of the White Swan Hotel are really good. The lobby is not too big, but there is an Internet celebrity spot `Hometown Water`, and a lot of tourists, diners and overseas Chinese come to punch in and take pictures every day.
This time, I stayed in the Executive Deluxe River View Twin Room, 60 square meters. As soon as I entered the door, there was a large walk-in corridor, with the wardrobe on the left and the washing area on the right. Walking in again is the room, which is very large and has a good structure. There are two windows on the left and right to see the river view. Three-person sofa, round dining table, long desk (with stationery in the drawer) everything.
The wash area has double washbasins, a single bathtub, the toilet and the shower room are separated, and the dry and wet are separated. Toiletries are ETRO in Italy.
The bedding is very comfortable, there are many choices of pillows, and the sleep is very good.
The gym and swimming pool of the hotel are in the back garden of the hotel. The gym is very large, with complete facilities and equipment; the swimming pool is outdoor and has a constant temperature. There is also a massage pool next to the swimming pool, which is also constant temperature. There are also dry steam and wet steam in the locker room, which is very good.

🛎️Service:
very good! Early contact, check-in, room service, cleaning, turndown, check-out and various communications were very smooth and comfortable. Thank you Mr. Huang Zhong, the assistant manager of the lobby, for his thoughtful arrangements and care!

🍲 Catering:
I have been to Yutang Chunnuan of White Swan and Hongtu Mansion before. This time I went to the executive lounge of White Swan. As soon as you enter the lounge, you will see a large area of books, with all kinds of books, you can take them back to the room to read if you like. The lounge is decorated in Chinese style, low-key and luxurious. It is the most tasteful executive lounge I have ever been to. There are high bar chairs and low sofas, which are very comfortable. There is also a small meeting room that can accommodate a dozen people. There is a long row of floor-to-ceiling glass windows by the window of the lounge, and the scenery of the sand surface is unobstructed.
There are six kinds of foreign wines in the lounge, which are very rich and can be adjusted to various cocktails. The food variety is not much, but it is exquisite. Afternoon tea, happy hour, buffet breakfast are all satisfied, and the service is very good! The waiter Xiaoye (a handsome little brother) is always smiling, and can quickly and accurately get the needs of the guests, which is very warm [happy]

After calling the room service, the hotel knew. At night, the drone has lights, and if the security patrol is conscious, it is easy to detect. We found out that the drone was flying for a long time after we informed the hotel. I'm afraid it's not just my room, other rooms should be photographed. No privacy at all! ! Self-occupation, visits from relatives and friends, and visits from clients have all lived here, and the good feelings for many years have been destroyed in one fell swoop! !

To be honest, in Shanghai, even the Ritz-Carlton at three or four thousand one nights is not as good as the White Swan. From the front desk to the luggage depar**ent, the lobby manager's guidance after check-in was very warm and comfortable. Although the first floor is always crowded with many diners who do not stay in the hotel, the hotel has the privileges that the hotel guests should have. For example, only the hotel guests can have morning tea at a designated time. In the end is the old Guangzhou five-star.

msg:Advantages: The location of the hotel is unique. I booked two river-viewing rooms for family travel. I like the room regardless of the pattern and color. The rooms are mainly light colors. Although the old hotel rooms do not have a very special style, they do not feel rustic. The service is quite considerate. Although the restaurants in the restaurant have five-star fees, the service and production are still good.
Areas that can be improved: 1. The room still uses instant coffee, which is enough for hotels to be improved into capsule coffee machines, not to mention five-star hotels, even B&Bs also use capsule coffee machines. This is the key point👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻2. There are not many varieties of buffet breakfast. Individual guests and the team all eat in the same hall, which is a little noisy.
Overall, the three days and two nights summer vacation in the White Swan was a pleasant experience.

The only thing that disappoints us is that the executive courtesy breakfast in the package was changed to Liufu Pavilion due to the epidemic.

Transportation: It is very convenient to travel. It is very close to Shangxiajiu Pedestrian Street, and it takes more than ten minutes by car.
Hygiene: Clean and tidy, ask twice a day if cleaning is required.
Environment: Needless to say, except for a few hotels in Zhujiang New Town where you can see Xiaomanyao, the river view is first-class.
Service: Impeccable. In a small episode, I left the changed clothes on the sofa in a hurry. When I came back, I folded them and put them in the corner of the bed, which made me feel a little embarrassed. If you have any small questions, just call a staff member in the lobby, they will definitely serve you from the beginning, and send us to the destination before going back. Can't praise the staff by name, because every single one of them was excellent, enthusiastic and professional. After staying for two days, my son was unwilling to leave, so he continued for another day.

Ignore the hardware all the software is up to the standard of a five star hotel. The service is really good, from the welcome to the front desk to the room, all the service staff are very friendly, and the room cleaning is also very clean. Prices are affordable. In fact, I stayed at White Swan for the refreshments of Hongtu House. After all, guests staying in the hotel should not line up. The delicious food is slightly expensive.
Of course, I still like the white swan. It was a good night.

Disadvantages: 1. There is a great smell when the electric toilet is started (room 1905). 2. I usually eat a small dumpling of that size at home, and put a few thin shark fins as a snack. The price is 108 yuan. After eating, I feel that it is not a cooking skill, but a concept of stealing. Shark fin countries have not advocated eating. 3.

I went to the hotel swimming pool for a while. The water quality is really not comparable to those of other swimming pools. My skin is relatively sensitive and I did not feel any discomfort after swimming. One piece is hard work. Since there is no swimming cap, fortunately the hotel can borrow it, which really makes me feel the careful consideration of the service. After inquiring about the laundry service, it is the hotel's own, so I can rest assured that many hotels now outsource the laundry to third parties, and the quality is really scary. Sure enough, it came back, both the quality and the packaging are satisfactory. Looking at the reviews, this morning tea is the highlight. I specially gave up the day's buffet breakfast and went to have morning tea. I can only sigh why there is only one person. There are too few varieties to order, sachima, barbecued pork buns... Only wait for me next time. There is also a small detail. I couldn't find a small essence of mine. I didn't know that after I went out and returned to my room the next day, I found that it was neatly placed on the towel in the bathroom. I guess it was accidentally dropped when I was cleaning it up. Where, the cleaners found and helped me put it back.

🔔Service: Thank you for the birthday cards written by carmen suna and eva from Guest Relations. The concierge service has a good attitude and the executive lounge service is also good. Every time I stand up and say hello.
However, the food and beverage products in the executive lounge are very general, difficult to eat, and do not meet the positioning. You can have less variety, but the quality must be guaranteed.

The biggest thunder point, although the birthday cake is huge, it is made of vegetable cream, which is not delicious, and hairs are found in the cake! Because it's a gift, I don't bother to complain. I'm sure I'm going to get mad when I change it!

msg:I went there on the sixth day of the new year. As a Guangzhou native, I went to eat a lot, but it was the first time I stayed in this first five-star hotel in the country. As far as five-star hotels are concerned, I think it is barely passable. The hardware and service of the room, the overall a**osphere is still impressive, the service of the lady at the front desk and the handsome guy in the room service is heart-warming. First, because the two rooms were not obtained at the same time, the lady at the front desk personally took it a little later. The room card was delivered to the room with good hygiene. Second, due to work reasons, I wanted to connect my laptop to the TV screen. The handsome guy on the floor helped me solve the problem very quickly.
But of course, there are also places where the experience is not good enough. The first is the happy hour of the executive lounge. We arrived around 6:30 in the afternoon, and the staff inside seemed to be waiting to get off work. The hot dishes provided were only two or three, and the others were Bread, salad, juice, etc., the variety is also pitiful. The speed of replacement of hot dishes is also very slow. I calculated it, and it is estimated that it will be changed every half an hour, so the experience of happy hour is not happy. The second is the concierge. We were carrying a large suitcase, and we knew that we were staying at the hotel. No one came to ask if we wanted to help. It was a bit... ah😮‍💨. Finally, there is a small suggestion, why is the hotel's gym and swimming pool so far away from the hotel's main building? And there is no passage for guests? ! So you can see that on the first floor of the bustling hotel, there will be a few guests wearing bathrobes passing by from time to time. Does the hotel really think this matches the image of a five-star hotel? After all, you are not a resort hotel like Sanya! It even represents the image of Guangzhou!

msg:In the past few decades, Guangzhou White Swan Hotel has been regarded as a supreme hotel in Laoguang. It stands on the White Swan Pond and is located on the periphery of the exotic Shamian Island. It is also a business card and landmark of Guangzhou. The purpose of this stay is to bring my mother and family here to finish the dream. According to the hotel's prompt, you can only check in after 2 pm every day. Maybe because it was Saturday, there was a long queue of guests who checked in. It took more than an hour to complete the check-in process. The check-in time is already very unpleasant. When the check-in procedure is completed, it is nearly 4 o'clock. The receptionist said that the room I stayed in has not been well sanitized, and I have to wait for more than an hour. I booked it on Ctrip that day. There are 3 river view rooms, only 1 room can be provided. In desperation, I can only accept it. What makes me most angry is that the hotel did not inform the other 2 rooms until 6 o'clock in the afternoon. It is unacceptable that there is such a thing. After checking in, I feel that although the room facilities are complete, it has begun to be outdated. The location of the river view room I booked is not bad, this is the only place I am happy. The breakfast the next day is really uncomplimentable. Except for the lack of variety and the quality is too general, it stopped serving early. I feel that the breakfast is not as good as that of a three-star hotel in China (356 yuan / 2 breakfasts). Personally, I think Guangzhou White Swan Hotel has relied on the feeling of eating old Guangzhou and the effect of old brand in the past few decades. It may be transformed into a state-owned enterprise and its management will lag. Except for its excellent location, there is nothing else worth staying for a second time.

The room facilities are very satisfactory in all aspects, except that there are no champagne glasses in the room, so I can only use red wine glasses, ha ha!
The breakfast was a bit disappointed, and the variety was not rich enough. For example, our Guangzhou people’s favorite Cantonese dim sum is only steamed buns and some steamed buns. They don’t even have the most basic dry steamed siu mai, let alone shrimp dumplings. I'm a little sorry for the positioning of the white swan.

msg:The White Swan Hotel is the best hotel I have ever stayed in China, not one of them!
The White Swan Hotel is a hotel that started planting grass very early. It is enough to be the first five-star hotel in the country.
It is very convenient to drive to the hotel. There are two antique cars at the entrance of the parking lot. A doorman will come to help pick up your luggage as soon as you enter from the lobby of the hotel.
The city view suite booked has a very wide view of the room, and when I enter the room, there is a feeling of traveling through time and space. The characteristic style of Suicheng can be seen from the window. The room is simple and elegant, with restrained and a**ospheric decoration. This kind of staggering is fascinating.
Specially ordered Yutang Chunnuan morning tea, there is no need to line up to get a seat. With the architectural style of Lingnan characteristic, the typical and authentic Cantonese morning tea, the first bite is so delicious that you want to cry. Highly recommend shrimp dumplings and crispy char siu. Barbecued pork can be regarded as the national ceiling.
Because there was something at home, I originally planned to stay for three nights and only stayed for one night. It is a pity and reluctance. I will only come here every time in the future.

I booked a standard room and listened to my lady's introduction to the river view room after I arrived. There was no embarrassment for the lady to let me upgrade to the river view for free. I added a few hundred dollars to upgrade to the river view, and it was really worth it. The bed is facing the river view, and the shutters at the head of the bed are opened to take pictures. It is also very pleasant to sit by the bed and drink tea and watch the scenery. The room is clean and hygienic, and the bathtub by the river is amazing.

The man-made waterfall "Hometown Water" that can be seen in the lobby is a must-have place to take pictures, and the open-air river view garden outside the fitness center is also a good place for walking. Basically, only residents go to stroll around, and the scenery is beautiful with few people.
3. The lady of the concierge introduced the hotel and its surroundings patiently. Downstairs is the sand noodles. Walking around, it is very suitable for taking pictures and hair circle, and the filming rate is very high. There is a bakery at the entrance to Shamian on the first floor, which is recommended. You can buy souvenirs, bread or cakes. Shaqima and Napoleon are two favorites. The sweetness of Saqima is moderate and personally favorite. For bread, cheese buns and cranberry soft European buns are recommended, both of which taste good.
In general, the hotel is very cost-effective, comfortable to live, good food, comfortable to stroll around, and would recommend friends to come over.

The reason for choosing White Swan is to taste the Guangzhou morning tea. The customer service can also enjoy VIP trea**ent when booking a tea place. No need to line up at the door, praise 👍! Suggestions for white swan morning tea, glutinous rice chicken, Lunjiao cake, Tingzi porridge, horse riding, shrimp dumplings. I won’t count the others one by one. The Yutang Chunnuan Hall has an elegant environment and high-grade.

msg:Staying at White Swan for the first time. Very comfortable check-in experience, the lobby is full of scenery, traditional culture and modernity complement each other. The front desk is very friendly. Going out of the north gate is the sand surface. The warm sun of early winter makes the alleys and streets mottled and comfortable through the towering banyan trees. Outside the main entrance of the hotel is the Pearl River, and you can see the neon flashing cruise ships at night. As its name suggests, the shop is noble, quiet and gentle.
My mother came here 30 years ago, and I look forward to bringing my family back in the near future.

msg:At the request of the elderly in the family, I also took advantage of the child's birthday to come to the White Swan in Laoguang's memory to live and dine, but unfortunately this experience is really full of slots.

Since the navigation and positioning is the side door on the 1st floor, there are two staff members (should be GR) who asked to check the health code when entering the door. However, I was holding the child in the left hand and carrying the suitcase in the right hand and asked how to get to the lobby. The two colleagues only pointed to the direction of the elevator, no Any regards and assistance.

I made a reservation a week in advance. When I checked in, the front desk could see the birthday note, indicating that the reservation depar**ent had put the guest's request into the system. Apparently GR didn't have any preparations. When the front desk asked if a bed surround was needed, I already knew that the room was temporarily emptied into the system. At that time, I still had a little expectation for the gift, after all, the front desk wanted me to show the child's identity proof in case "Xiao Wool". After returning to my room at night, I was extremely disappointed with this so-called gift. A box of Sakima and a box of food similar to Napoleon's pastry cost only 50 yuan. Even if there is a "wool", it is not too much to be a courtesy.
On the day of check-in, someone handed over the item to me. After I took it, the front desk still told me that it had been handed over to me the next day. I don't know if the concierge forgot to delete the alert or said that the night shift did not check the records that day.
What made me even more speechless was when I was wandering around the hotel and saw an employee in a black and gray suit put his hands in his trouser pockets. …
The only thing that made me feel good was the switchboard, although I only made one phone call to ask for drinking water, greetings, asking for requests, repeating customer needs, saying goodbye, and every step was up to standard.

The above are all my complaints as a FO colleague. As an old Guang, the complaints about Yutang Chunnuan will only start now. The overall structure of the private room is narrow and insufficient in height, and the overall appearance is very depressing. There are few seafood varieties, and the dishes are quite satisfactory. All the dishes are mediocre, except for the red bean paste with dried orange peel and red bean paste. The most unacceptable thing for me is that I bring my own cognac. When I asked for wine glasses, the waiter asked for a cleaning fee of 30 yuan per glass. And when I asked for a single drink, I got a big pot. I can only say that the price of a meal is 14K. Many Chinese restaurants in Zhujiang New Town are much better than the so-called black pearl three diamonds.

In the end, I still gave a 5-point evaluation. This is out of my respect for my peers, and I have already posted a 0-point negative review in my heart. The hotel industry is not easy to do, but if the service attitude is not correct, the loss is not only the memory of Lao Guang, but also the legend of the name White Swan.

msg:The white swan was the originator of the previous five-star hotel. When I went to book, I was worried that the hotel had too long history and the facilities were too old, but I was hesitating. Finally, I booked it. I was not disappointed. The lady at the front desk service was very polite. , Very professional, the room has been upgraded for us, 30 square meters to 60 square meters, the sense of space in the room has increased, and the bed has naturally increased by 2 meters, so happy, looking at the newly renovated room hardware facilities and materials are not simple, Decisively decided to taste the Michelin restaurant by the way. To tell the truth, Yutang Chunnuan and Hongtu Mansion have eaten two Michelins. The dishes are not very amazing to our local Guangzhou people, but the proactive attitude and enthusiasm of the waiter really makes people I feel very comfortable, and I am very happy with the 15% service charge! Compared with the four seasons and magnificence of Zhujiang New Town and the Park Hyatt Hotel, it is more comfortable and happy to live, with the kind of service consciousness and Guangzhou human touch in it! Special praise to the room attendant Mo Bingchao, who came to help us close the windows and other warm services at night. The quality is really good. It is worthy of the hotel to praise the staff! The White Swan is worth your stay, and I will experience it again!

🧹Sanitation: Five-star, sanitation is of course OK. Parking at the door to the lobby, everyone is so polite.
🍃Environment: The environment is unique-it is really top-notch 👍Many tourists will go to Li Sui, after all, Guangzhou is a landmark. In my opinion, the environment is better than that of Rose Hotel. I would like to talk about a geographical location and a historical and cultural heritage. They are definitely different. Each has its own merits. But in fact, I prefer WhiteSwan to have a pyrotechnic and human touch. I don’t know what to do. I have secretly decided that I must stay in Li once more. There are so many scenic spots around. It’s because I’m too thin, so I only go. Left cruise ship PearlRiverNight Cruise. It’s the first time to bravely go and force people to board a boat. I guess it’s not wrong to go to the top of the boat to experience it. My mother and son (female) three are really excited 🥰
🔔Service: The service is okay. I tried the Yutang Spring Warm system, the service is first-rate, and the product is just average. Everyone knows the price. The breakfast is Liufuge food, and there may be some group guests, so I feel that the service is not good, and the products are relatively few. But the view by the window is really picturesque. I have to mention that the bathtub is right 🥳
In short, I want to stay in the hotel again 😄

msg:Very good hotel, worthy of the pride of the national brand. The appearance looks unpleasant, but its service kills most of the five-star hotels at home and abroad. From the beginning of the reservation, everyone has done their job in their place. The best service is not to feel the service but makes people very comfortable and appropriate. The White Swan Hotel, which has received many domestic and foreign guests, has done this.
The hotel is strategically located in the sand facing the river, with picturesque scenery. There is Huangsha subway station and it is also convenient to take a taxi.
The room hardware is quite satisfactory or even a bit old, but many hotels no longer provide turn-down services. There are many paper magazines and books for reading in the guest room to help guests understand the history of the white swan and Shamian.
Without breakfast, I booked a meal for White Swan and Hongtu Mansion. Hotel guests have priority to renew their contracts. Small expensive but good value for money.

This time I specifically explained that I don't want the end room. It was much better and I had a good night's sleep. But the room is still very small, only stayed for one night this time. Hotel guests don’t have to line up for breakfast or dinner downstairs. This is a good benefit. There was a free cruise last year, but this year there is none. It’s a shame.

msg:I've always wanted to come to the White Swan since I was young. It is a landmark for the locals. I finally came to live this time. I ordered a big bed room. I felt a little disappointed after entering. It feels similar to an ordinary express hotel, but after all, it is a hotel of thousands of yuan, so I am a little disappointed. There are no welcome fruits, snacks, etc. The minibar is also charged. The scenery outside the window is beautiful, you can see the blue sky and white clouds, the sandy street scene, the bed is soft and comfortable, some movies on TV can be selected, the tea bags delivered, and 2 small moon cakes are also delicious. The bathroom is very ordinary, there is no shower, only a bathtub, so if it feels dirty, you can't take a bath, you can only stand in the bathtub, and there is only a shower curtain, which feels dirty and very cheap. The hotel has a fitness room and spa, swimming pool, swimming pool scenery is good, there are hot pools, like hot springs, spas are also good, there are pools, dry and wet steam, shower rooms are also big. Anyway, the wish is fulfilled after the experience!

The overall environment is good, that is, the entry and exit of each door is a bit cumbersome. It feels that this design is like a feature of the reopening period. Without passports, home return permits or foreign exchange coupons, ordinary people can't enter. The service was good, the front desk also delayed 2 hours of check-out (went to Yutang Chunnuan for lunch) and sent postcards for help. For in-house guests, parking is free. The air conditioner in the house is very quiet and the shower is good. Just step into the bathtub, and then the area is a bit small.

Follow the navigation guidance to the parking lot entrance on the inner floor of the sand is closed. There are no parking guidelines nearby. After going around three circles alive, in the end, he could only ask the waiter on the first floor of the hotel. It was only then that the entrance to the parking lot was on the bridge outside Shamian Island. After finding the entrance, I drove to the second floor parking lot of the hotel. The service was very poor! Regardless of whether the guest is a tourist or a tourist, I parked in a line and waited for 10 minutes before being arranged under a tree. When I took the car the next day, as shown in the picture, the car was full of fruits! Another point is very unsatisfactory. As a five-star hotel, there is no capsule coffee machine. A large bottle of Fuji mineral water costs 58 yuan. The hotel’s frugality is reflected everywhere, with only one set of bath products and only two bottles of mineral water. There is only one box of tissues. Have stayed in many five-star hotels, the White Swan is really unworthy. Really disappointed with it. Friends who travel to Guangzhou, really don't recommend it here.

As if I owe him money, I swipe my phone in the office and don't stand guard at the front desk. Originally an outdated hotel, the service is so poor, it is ashamed.
No wonder occupancy rates are miserably low, and there's a reason for that.

msg:Generally, the place to go will give priority to five-star hotels, after all, it will be better to take a baby.
Share the experience directly, this is my first time giving a bad review:
I can check in at 1 or 2 o'clock. We arrived at 3:30. The front desk told me to wait. The standard room has not been cleaned. If you want to check in immediately, you can add money to upgrade to a deluxe type. I haven't reacted at this time.
2. Then I said, can we provide a double bed standard room? A: The twin beds are all sold out, you can choose deluxe, large room, double bed
It took me a while to realize that it was because I didn't buy a deluxe room, *****. No wonder I could easily book a room the day before, and during the National Day, the house price dropped again and again, the occupancy rate was obvious, usually a few hundred, I booked it in the early thousand
Not finished yet:
When I got to the room, the child was soaking ****, and the bathroom smelled so bad that I found out that there was no ventilation. I asked the waiter and answered: Because it is a central air conditioner, I have to open the door and ventilate the room 😱😱😱, there is no exhaust in the toilet. In the end, I found it, because there was no response from the exhaust vent. He had nothing to say. He called a repairman. After a while, the repairman said that the filter was broken and replaced it, but there was still no response. They defended It's the central air conditioner. Dare I have never seen the central air conditioner? Does your bathroom exhaust air into the room? Unheard of design. In the end, they called their supervisor. They only admitted that the room design was like this, and promised me to bring a purifier. As a result, I didn't see the purifier when I checked out.
The last night was woken up by the next door 2 times.
Bought sachima, really not as good as ordinary, just not so sweet
Thank you for your service for making me decide not to enjoy your 500-person buffet. I don't want to affect my travel mood because of my stay, so I didn't look for them again, it's not worth it. Really refreshed my understanding of five-star

The dishes are also average, especially the steamed fish is served slowly, and it is not cooked until it is finished. In the morning, Xi'an is especially chaotic. Since they are all pre-sale coupons, you should be able to carefully arrange the time of dining. As a result, it feels extremely bad to queue up. The buffet variety is not rich enough, and the taste is not unique. In short, the drinking and drinking of the White Swan is disappointing.

優點：
1.地理位置好，位於沙麪島，2層出去東門打車，1層出去北門到沙麪島漫步，都很方便；
2.酒店內餐飲好，自帶豐富的餐廳設施，下雨天感覺不用出門，封在酒店也可以吃很好；
3.江景好，如上所述；
4.酒店服務好，服務熱情、規格到位；
5.房間內設施不舊，雖是老牌酒店，但並無陳舊氣息。雖是陰雨季，但沒啥陰濕異味，空調靈敏且噪音不大。
雞蛋裡挑骨頭：
1.空調和燈光操控面板燈光不能滅，尤其是空調面板。好在酒店服務不錯，想辦法遮了下光。建議後期都安裝遮光板；
2.洗髮水沐浴露不知道是啥品牌，感覺一般般；
3.智能坐便器真不錯，但規格不算大，好擔心外國友人屁股太大拉外面（過分操心了）

最後我沒交錢升級，把行李寄存就去影相，影了大概15分鐘，13：40回來問另一個客服（那一男一女不在），人家電腦一查就説有房了讓我入住。
這一男一女兩個客服為了幫酒店創收無可厚非，但太着跡了會讓客人心裏不舒服。

晚飯時間出去了，回去酒店後看到門上掛着牌子，説是知道生日會送小禮物，然後打了電話查詢，職員馬上送了上來。收到了小卡片，而且是手寫的祝福，太有心了，還有兩份小禮物，不過是什麼禮物就不説了，留給大家去體驗。

房間景觀開揚，很舒服，感覺坐在玻璃前面看着江景可以待一整天。浴室的浴缸那邊也不錯，也是看着江景，不過浴缸的堵水塞有點問題，塞不牢，水會一直慢慢漏走，泡一會兒就又要加水了。

從在酒店門前下車的一刻，酒店職員服務就很好，很殷勤，也幫忙提行李，很周到。

這次體驗還不錯，就是入住的人比較多，大堂都是熙來攘往的，環境寧靜一點更好。

msg:優點：訂的江景房，酒店獨佔天鵝潭一角，眺望珠江波光粼粼，景色屬於天花板的存在，房間的硬件條件能看出五星檔次，酒店恆温泳池在江邊上，感覺很奢華。再説缺點：酒店的整個大堂每天熙熙攘攘，就像農貿市場，找不到一個安靜注意的地方；酒店的服務很國營範，排長隊辦理入住居然沒有一杯水。晚上給房間送兩瓶水居然要半小時，蕎麥皮的枕頭也送完了。泳池游完要自己準備毛巾。如果説酒店的硬件和位置是五星，服務可能三星都沒有。可能下次不會入住了，雖然酒店不愁客人。

msg:這扣的一分中半分給了餐飲，半分給了管理和服務。五星級的賓館走親民路線固然值得倡導但不能以犧牲住客體驗作為前提。一到三樓成了公眾旅遊景點，擁擠程度堪比火車站。早茶是招牌，住客可以優先預訂，但這個預訂不是以checkin才開始，衹要下單就可以電話預訂了，箇中貓膩就大有可為。我就問一句，我訂個房間預訂一兩桌 （每桌10人，2位住客各招待一桌），1500的房間好比每人多75塊茶位費，實際並不入住，是否已經破防了所謂住客優先的現行的不按check in才算住客預訂的bug規則呢。至於餐飲的質量問題，可參考某眾點評上的評價（重點可參考商家如女人月事般標準回覆），就不要指望能後期改善。正面的4分是看在老天賞飯吃的地理位置和對創建者的愛國熱情。

如果人不多的話，參觀酒店是不錯的體驗，但是房間設施一般，空調味道有些濃，淋雨還要站在浴缸裏，而且那個梢很難拔…
玉春堂餐飲不錯，食材新鮮，茶水費也不算貴，雖然要排隊叫號，但是專門有客房的號，可以在酒店休息，等叫號。
酒店就在沙麪，中午人眾人，晚上沒什麼燈光，所以晚上遊客少了很多。

msg:小時候就聽到白天鵝賓館，這次特意早早地預訂了房間。賓館本身不錯，位於沙麪，位置佳，視野好，房間整潔，打掃非常及時，服務員態度親切，酒店前台效率很高，但還是有些美中不足：
（1）雖然酒店秉承開放態度很好，但是現在變成了旅遊景點之一，人員嘈雜，1樓2樓到處是拖着行李箱在酒店拍照的人，住店客人感受度不好，建議在春節之類高峯期間適當限流。
（2）吐槽一下酒店裡的餐廳。玉堂春暖，宏圖府，住店客人預訂沒有優先權，我天天早上7：00要去排隊拿號。最客氣的是，玉堂春暖還搗漿糊，企圖騙我去包房吃（菜品單價高不算，還限時1小時），當我拒絕時，前台接待的人還試圖把我的號往後挪，因為被我戳穿而作罷。在五星級賓館發生這種情況很遺憾。
（3）關於酒店沙琪瑪，也是需要提前1小時排隊買。住店客人也不能提前預訂，排隊人員購買也不限量，我是幸運地買到了最後的2個。
本來挺休閑的旅遊，結果上了3天早班，略有遺憾。

重點想吐槽：樓下的餐廳宏圖府，不明白為什麼可以評為米其林三星？！完全不達標，餐食難吃，服務也不到位，期間兩次不同的服務員可能培訓不到位，記錯台號吧，回覆不是我提的問題，且剛上菜就叫我買單，肯定是記錯台號，那個178的果仁牛肋肉為什麼要炸成豬油渣？不是浪費牛肉嗎？説難吃也沒有個反饋，沙琪瑪真的不好吃，不知道網上為什麼評論那麼神，天鵝酥葉馬馬虎虎吃不出味道……這頓早餐吃了1000不知道吃了個寂寞，出門還不如隔壁喬美。完全不值。不推薦！

喜歡漫步沙麪，感受這裏令人五味雜陳的歷史氣韻。床頭厚厚一本歷史書讓人感歎這幾百年間國家走向強大富足的艱辛不易。我會再來的。

❶一般來説都是2點入住，我們當時是1點到的，説是馬上可以，等房間整理好就發訊息。但是一直到下午3點半也沒有。後來聯繫前台説已經好了給我們送房卡，結果等到4點多才送來
❷在春堂玉暖消費了750+，然後退房的時候並沒有在按金里扣，我反覆打給前台才聯繫上。後續➕V付款，結果給過來的金額還是錯的。就是一整個不嚴謹

作為老牌五星，別的不説，這個服務態度工作狀態問題好嚴重呀！望自省！

早餐住店客人跟食客價格幾乎一樣，反倒勾起了我的興趣，不過出品確實跟酒店餐廳有差距，建議選無早的房型即可。

就是餐飲很難吃，一樓浮光閣自助早餐，可選擇的餘地很少，幾乎都是白人飯；行政走廊也沒什麼吃的，不符合中國人胃口。玉堂春暖尚可
服務也不好，找前台開個發票，拿起手機就瞎拍我手機裏的發票抬頭，我要求前台把拍到的照片刪掉，因為沒來得及把私隱訊息隱去，反正態度很不好，不想影響心情，所以沒有跟她吵架，第一次在五星級酒店遇到這樣的服務態度，雖然每個人都有脾氣，沒有説服務員就低人一等，可是我這很合理的訴求，不明白那女的為什麼這態度？
要求客房服務員消毒浴缸、給了小費後，馬上就簡單沖一下了，不到1.5分鐘的消毒浴缸時間。
還有一樓餐廳服務員，由於是廣交會期間，所以很在乎外人面前的形象，我們有孕婦已經孕晚期了，腳部水腫不適，穿着酒店拖鞋進餐廳，硬是攔着不准我們進去，一定要我們上樓去換，非常鬧心的服務。住了那麼多酒店，包括上萬一晚的，穿拖鞋、穿浴袍、打包早餐的都有，從來沒有遇到這樣強行阻止客人進餐廳的。服務一星⭐不能再多了！

酒店是內地的第一家“五星級”酒店，今年整整40週年，抵達後從禮賓部和前台的細緻認真，我覺得一點都不亞於國外的那些高端品牌酒店，這次住的是初級房間，與以往江景不同，這次我選擇了城景，俯瞰沙麪和廣州老城有不一樣的感覺，我還挺喜歡的。
我這個房間沒有單獨的淋雨間，是和浴缸在一起的。其實這個房間大小也足夠了！
不足之處：酒店的配套設施比如健身房的裝備有一點點舊了哦，希望升級！還有就是如果是自動馬桶就更好啦！
總的來説，我下次來廣州，還會選擇白天鵝！

首先接待人員（姓葉）這張臉是沒有任何感情的，回答問題就是機器人式的，我訂了兩間房，居然給了我走廊的一頭一尾（廣東朋友告訴我，在他們那裡是非常忌諱的）你給我一個頭或者一個尾我還氣得過，居然給了頭和尾！我不知道他哪裡來的底氣可以帶着這幅表情和態度工作。
房間非常小，設施已經非常陳舊了。但大堂還是很漂亮的。後面有著名的建築羣。早茶據説非常有名，我也去湊個熱鬧。8個人消費1500元，但沒有吃飽，一點也沒吃飽。

最不喜歡的是春節期間外來的客人太多，有些是吃飯的，有些就是遊客進來拍照打卡的，搞得大堂亂糟糟的，一樓的衞生間就像公廁一樣還在排隊。
假期溢價不划算，而且每次去宏圖府和玉堂春暖都是在排隊，體驗感不好。宏圖府的早茶味道還是不錯的。
房間床型很小，帶着娃入住沒有加床的話有點擠。

很多人都覺得白天鵝的地理位置不方便，其實並沒有。先不提步行距離就可以抵達的上下九和永慶坊，到地鐵站也衹需要步行7～8分鐘，除了需要過一個天橋外並不是很麻煩。

還有一個問題就是江景雙床房的06號房和攜程圖片不相符，除了景觀外遠次於另外的 09號房：沒有景觀浴缸、面積也要小很多。希望酒店可以在訂單中提醒住客然後讓他們備註更喜歡06還是09號房。

特別想感謝下餐廳，下午主動電話我確認我的預訂，感覺餐廳比前台做的好很多，這次的前台真的讓人覺得不專業。

內容：
在我們最近入住的酒店裡，黃先生，酒店的大堂經理，提供了一次令人難忘的住宿體驗。在得知我們小朋友對恐龍的熱愛後，黃先生細心安排並免費為我們佈置了一個專屬的恐龍主題房間。當我們打開房門的一剎那，那精心設計的恐龍世界令整個家庭都驚喜萬分，特別是我們的小朋友，他的臉上綻放出純真的喜悦，這一刻將成為我們珍貴的回憶。

除此之外，黃先生的周到服務還體現在他為我們預訂了早茶。他不僅考慮到了我們的餐飲需求，而且還提前幫我們安排好了就座，這讓我們的早晨開始得格外愜意。

我想借此機會表達我們深深的感激之情。黃先生的專業態度和對細節的關注，顯然體現出酒店對客户服務的極高標準。這樣的服務不僅讓我們感到舒適和愜意，也讓我們對酒店留下了極佳的印象。我們肯定會推薦這家酒店給我們的親友，並期望不久再次光臨。

謝謝，黃先生，以及酒店的全體員工，你們的努力和熱情讓旅途變得如此美好！

真心推薦！⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

他的歷史文化底蘊，以及至今仍能堅持的優質服務，是其他酒店難以取代的。入住的話，可以抽空看一下他的歷史展覽廳，以及放在床邊的「先天下」。

msg:來廣州必住白天鵝比較失望的體驗，1.入住當天想續住第三天的房間（在攜程提前衹安排了倆晚），溝通了好久説沒有雙床房得換房間（事後驗證有且有很多）又説價格得申請（事後攜程價格比審批的便宜）。2.訂餐非常失望，當天的晚餐説得五點十五分親自去（住店客人的優惠在哪裡），第二天的早茶也是必須親自去排號，好在經過溝通取了號可以回房間等。你們就留個房間號，溝通個吃飯的時間怎麼了？做不到嗎？我也不是非要趕着點去吃。3.晚餐吃的很一般，不能説失望吧，體驗感確實差了。你們對得起你們的價格嗎？4.因為要趕早班機，提前晚上七點半特意和前台溝通了發票問題，鬱悶的是早晨去前台，又是那天入住的小姑娘，竟然説發票開了沒找到！嗯哈！電子票（餐費）也不知道在哪裡？感覺白天鵝酒店的管理層出了問題，服務態度你不能説不好，給人的感覺就是不熱情很死板（我們當地的政府業務大廳都比你們強太多），冷冰冰的前台啊你怎麼是這樣子的？（客房，行李部還是以前的感覺）老城區的老字號，難道你就如此墮落下去了嗎？

白天鵝作為廣州甚至全國酒店業的一個標桿，雖然不似其他一些新的超豪華酒店那麼時尚、裝修的富麗堂皇，但始終秉承着五星級的服務理念。
酒店的氣場非常穩定，給人一種絲毫不在外地出差住酒店的感覺，始終是一種非常親切柔和的歸屬感。
最喜歡的還是江景房，看着珠江緩緩的流水，夜來人靜時，遊輪緩緩的駛過，閃爍的霓虹彷彿在訴説著珠江豪情。
無論酒店業如何的發展，白天鵝賓館始終是我對賓館服務理念的最高認識。
另外，感謝大堂經理劉經理升房，感覺很温馨周到。謝謝。

酒店聽説是開了很多年，但房間完全不陳舊，沒有老房屋特有的那種味道，也沒有很濃郁的酒店香薰味道，是非常清新的一種味道。味道敏感者放心選。裝潢也不像別的老酒店那樣過分富麗堂皇，反而是現在比較流行的木質裝飾，深得我心。
總體來説是非常滿意的一次入住體驗。

msg:白天鵝的房間寬敞，有60方，衞生間也超級闊綽敞亮，是居住體驗很棒的老飯店。説老，但設施維護翻新到位，地毯和大理石地面牆面都依然保養新凈整齊。房間細節設計合理：由於面朝珠江陽光燦爛，房間有可以全自動控制的全遮光窗簾和半透光沙簾，還有各種不刺眼的燈光光源可以選擇，感覺很舒服。各種電器插座的數量充足，位置合理。正對空調風口的位置也不感到太大的吹襲感，但整個房間感覺有空氣循環，不窒悶。這是很難得的，衹有少數飯店能做到的。關於服務，我們原本對玉堂春暖的預訂系統有點意見，感覺還不是特別合理。但跟餐廳的蘇經理還是周經理提出後，都能虛心接受我們意見，並積極地給予幫助，還給餐品打了折扣，送了果盤。讓我們感受到廣州酒店管理人員的素質和誠意。最後，我離店到機場後才發現將一件衣服忘在房間衣櫥裏了，打電話過去，房間服務部馬上回復有發現我的衣服，可以馬上幫我快遞迴京。這才是五星級酒店的優質服務！點贊👍

msg:白天鵝可以説是建國以來具代表性的酒店了，此次廣州之行入住也是慕名而來，但感覺不盡人意：
1、可能是因為是資深老酒店，員工一個個自我感覺特別良好，尤其是站在酒店各個出口的員工，面無表情，基本不會給你提供任何服務，更不用説禮貌的問候了，簡直就是擺設。
2、環境嘈雜，啥時候都有特別多的大爺大媽在拍照，吵嚷，鬧心！
3、早餐人多嘈雜不説，服務也跟不上，居然進去吃早餐還要拿個小紙條記錄，真落後。而且早餐每天就那麼些菜，永遠不變。尤其蔬菜🥬少，要吃蔬菜得讓煮麪的師傅煮上一碗；
4、有史以來住過Wi-Fi最垃圾的酒店。不停的掉線，信號差到離譜。居然到了衞生間就沒有信號；
5、到的第一天打電話問總枱早餐在幾層，總枱還要説等下查查我包不包早餐才會告訴我！簡直了，如果真是我不包早餐我就沒權利知道早餐廳在哪兒嗎？太牛了吧！
6、我此次旅遊一路上住的所有酒店均有每天的房間水果贈送，就白天鵝，每天給送兩塊餅乾，而且住了三天衹送兩天，太小家子氣了，這樣與其不送！
7、不留神睡衣落在酒店，酒店打電話來問我怎麼處理，我説寄過來吧，我到付。好傢伙，隨後來個短訊囉哩囉嗦又讓我給另一個管家發訊息，什麼入住名字退房時間什麼物件寄不寄等等…，人在旅途不是很方便，就把其中部分訊息直接回復了，末了我還加上“謝謝”，結果愣沒有人搭理我！起碼的禮貌都不懂，員工素質太差！
同一個酒店的員工，就不能轉告處理一下嗎？這麼怕擔責任？
總之，作為老牌酒店近2000的價格，覺得很不值！
實事求是的講，酒店位置和外圍景觀還是不錯的。
但服務軟件服務細節如此，希望引起酒店管理層的重視

2、房型設計的不錯，動線分區合理，唯一是客控的燈光系統不夠明確，操作起來不是很方便。
3、提前定了宏圖府的餐位，到了8點多去確實有很多不住店客人在等位了，餐廳更像一個大宴會廳，廣州特色吧，比較鬧，整體的點心口味都不錯，但確實性價比不高，過程中小朋友要喝水，問了服務員礦泉水，説要49一瓶，我説是住店客人，就客房提供的免費水就行，再確認了我的房卡後拿了一瓶，這個過程體驗很不好。

一晚的入住體驗下來給出幾點建議：1、如週末或節假日客人實在太多，提前做好加快辦理入住預案，加人手或者自助辦理機器協同；2、餐廳用餐不管是宏圖府還是玉堂春暖，座位號可以區分下酒店客人還是純用餐客人，方便服務管理，其次按照餐廳的人均消費，不管客人是不是住店的要喝個水，我覺得應該要免費提供，更顯得酒店大氣！

msg:酒店的景色太好了！而且去夜遊珠江或者周邊都很方便。酒店大堂有個小瀑布，兒子看見説這是土豪酒店，哈哈哈哈。前台的服務小姐姐態度特別好，建議我們在等房間的時候先去沙麪玩，可以不耽誤時間。第一次入住，詢問了一些問題，也都温柔的回答了。升級了房間，可以直接躺床上房間看到江景。帶小朋友也很方便，有專門的小童馬桶墊圈和成套的小童洗漱用品，非常可愛。酒店的米其林餐廳強烈推薦去吃一下，真的好吃😋。回來就推薦給朋友了，去廣州一定要住這個酒店。

1983年開業，中途停業重新裝修過，
國內首家五星級賓館，
一樓流浮閣西餐廳，也是早餐自助餐廳，
二樓宏圖府，營業時間至14點，吃早茶的餐廳，
三樓玉堂春暖，乖乖不得了的中餐廳，正餐+早茶，但是衹在休息日，節假日才提供早茶。

連住兩晚，體驗了不同房型，不同樓層，江景房面積幾乎是非江景房的兩倍，雙洗漱台。

服務槓槓的，普通房沒有茶具，提出需求後給予解決。
