Morning breakfast on a Sunday will be a bonus as its on level50 with a nice view and huge variety. Normal days will be on level2 at the Cafe with lesser variety. 

The room is clean and no bad odour. Clean sheets and bathroom. The corridor has thick carpets. No worries for corridor noise. 

Walk to 万象城 takes 15mins. Use the apps ASAP for navigation. It's a huge nice shopping mall with all the brands you can think of. 

东门小吃 is 15mins walks for all the street food and small retail shops.

Food for buffet is ok but food too less, such as seafood do not have lobster and long leg crab, if have more kind seafood will be good. Also the roast beef are too well done no juice very difficult easy to eat, not too much western food, for drink no fresh orange juice, bbq not too much just only chicken no beef and other, little bit disappointed. Think if all can improve then everything will be good. Anyway, I will come and stay again.

msg:The Hotel is very nicely located in the Shenzhen Luohu Area. It is easily accessible by subway from Guomao Station. Also the lively food and evening area Dongmen is just one station away at Laojie. The check in was easy and the staff is very polite. Most of them also speak English. The room was very nice and had all necessary equipment. The only complaint I would have is a little stinky smell from the toilet drain and also that the seal for the shower was leaking into the bathroom. 
The breakfast was just ok in my opinion, some mediocre Chinese dishes and the western food is just below average compared with hotels in Europe. I would recommend the hotel very much, just without the breakfast and rather eat outside. 

So all in all a 4.5

Room rate is acceptable if booked on line. May consider to stay again next time.

Service was good: staff called us a cab to Shenzhen train station.
Rooms were clean. The only thing was that we still had garbage of the previous guests in our bin

The hotel are newly renovated, big size twin beds , room with quality set up. Love it. 
Will definitely return to this hotel.

I have stayed in many hotels, but I still feel that the service at the Renaissance Pangnian Hotel is the best. The front desk staff is very good and professional. They introduced the hotel and surrounding information when checking in, giving customers a very comfortable experience. I would like to thank Ms. Chen at the front desk for checking me in. The service was very good, and Ms. Zhu was also very easy-going and enthusiastic. The room was also newly renovated, with a unique style, clean and tidy, and the bedding was very soft, which I also liked very much. I will choose this hotel again in the future.

Because we were here to celebrate our birthday, they specially prepared a birthday cake for us, which required the use of iron buckets. Ice cubes were used to freeze the wine, and Daisy responded quickly to requests. It was very good, and the breakfast was also very good. I happened to have dinner on the 50th floor. The view was very good, and I was very satisfied. The room was clean and spotless, and the air conditioner was very powerful! The facilities are well-equipped, and it is very safe to stay.

It’s a long-established hotel. I’ve been here since I was a kid.
After new decoration, it is hygienic and good
But it's within a waving distance from the residential buildings opposite.

Breakfast in the revolving restaurant on the 50th floor
It's a pity that it's not rotating. It suddenly became ordinary.
There are mysterious water stains on the transparent glasses. They should be replaced.

The room was nice, but it took a long time to wait for check-in.
There were 2 or 3 groups of guests checking in next to me.
I was still waiting. The front desk explained that there was something wrong with the room I had reserved and that I had to transfer to another room.
But it takes too long to be patient. It’s not good when there aren’t many people.

He said it was good and he would upgrade the room and make it quieter.
But once I got there, the room was right next to the elevator. I laughed when I saw it.
Fortunately, the room is nice

When checking in, everyone wanted to line up according to the rules, but because the hotel did not open check-in and check-out deliberately, some people deliberately jumped in the queue later, but the hotel did not deal with the queue-jumping people. People present were very dissatisfied, but the lobby manager turned a blind eye. The entire check-in process took a full 45 minutes, but there were only 3 pairs of passengers in front of us in line. It is conceivable that it will be much faster if you jump in line and do not follow the rules.

The location of the hotel is not very close to Dongmen Old Street. If you bring children, the walk will take about 15 minutes.
But it’s very close and convenient to Jinguanghua.

The hardware is good, clean and hygienic, the room is large, and the bathroom is also large. Shower gel, shower liquid smells good. Unfortunately, the pillow was too soft and it was hard to sleep.

Belle, the front desk clerk, was quick and helpful when checking out, and deserves the best 5-star rating.

Fruits, cakes, rice rolls, fresh vegetables, etc. are all delicious. There are four types of porridge. I tried the chicken porridge, which was delicious, light and salty, and milk, coffee, bean and berry juice. Everything is ready, the waiter closes the dishes quickly, and enthusiastically offers hot ginger tea and hot coffee, which is touching. The front desk staff has a very good attitude. The young man ALEX's service is detailed and thoughtful, making you feel at home. If there is still a little regret, there is only a buffet in the revolving restaurant on the 50th floor for two days on weekends. Personally, I think it would be better if the bathroom room could have a retractable rope to hang towels, underwear, etc.

As soon as I entered the room at night and turned on the air conditioner, I felt very hot.
I went to the front desk and told him that the central air-conditioning could not be changed.
Finally, I found an older brother to open the window.
The conclusion is that it was so hot all day and night that I was sweating, and I had a hard time heading back to Hong Kong in the morning.

It is very hygienic and clean. The service of the front desk lady is pretty good. The check-in time and procedures are very complicated. The time is normal. I checked in at 5:30 pm and the check-out time can only be postponed to 1 pm. It would be better if the check-out time can be extended to 2 pm in general hotels.
The breakfast was average, the scenery was first-class, the afternoon tea cakes tasted numb, and the coffee was good. Considering that it was more than 1,000 yuan on New Year's Day, the overall stay was a good experience. I will stay here again next time.

The front desk clerk said that there is no air-conditioning in the hotel rooms, but the air-conditioning in the corridors and restaurants is very strong. I can't figure out why? The revolving restaurant has a rich buffet dinner with a wide variety of food and drinks! The food is delicious and the revolving restaurant on the 50th floor has a beautiful view! Compared with the buffet breakfast, it is very different. The breakfast milk tea is bland and tasteless. I believe there is huge room for improvement! There are not many types of food, but the taste is delicious! Generally speaking, it must be paired with the buffet dinner in the revolving restaurant to feel that it is cost-effective!

msg:I stayed for one night and booked two rooms. I felt that the lobby was a bit messy and the room was not very satisfactory, so I changed hotels the next day. Originally, the matter ended here, but due to my carelessness, I left out a bottle and did not use it several times. 100 The small black bottle of Lancôme ml was in the hotel. After contacting the hotel, the hotel staff quickly contacted me. At first, I called and said that the cleaning lady saw a small black bottle, but she didn’t know where it was and needed to find it. After a while, if I couldn't find someone to compensate me, I kept waiting. Then I called back and said for various reasons that the thing was lost. I hope I understand. I lost something carelessly and I have nothing to say, but It's really strange that this attitude changes from time to time. Moreover, this is not a small bottle. I have only used it a few times and there is more than half a bottle left. It doesn't make sense to say that I just throw it away when it is used up. What happens to the things? I don’t know where it is. Judging from the hotel’s attitude, I probably don’t want to take care of it anymore, so let’s leave it at that! Everyone, be sure to bring good things with you when you go out. Don’t lose things like me, otherwise you really won’t be able to find them back😭

msg:The twin room is very large. There is a long sofa under the window sill, which is very convenient. If you are traveling with children, you need to book a bed stall with the front desk in advance so that the children will not fall off. Breakfast is from 6:30 to 10:30 in the morning. It is in the revolving restaurant on the 50th floor. It may be that the breakfast time is long, so the crowd is not very concentrated. It is quite good. Because I have booked a flight at 5:00 in the afternoon, I applied with the front desk. Delayed check-out until 2 o'clock. I'm very grateful to the lady at the front desk when I checked in. I didn't know her name, but she remembered that she was wearing a white dress that day.

msg:The room felt neat and clean, but it was a pity that when I took a shower, I found that there was a little ash in the bathtub, and I had to rewash it several times before I could take a bath safely.
The service attitude is first-class, every waiter is so polite, it feels good👍🏻
I haven't used the facilities, so I can't comment.

Buffet for two at Yunjingxuan Revolving Restaurant (choose one from lunch or dinner): There are many choices of food for dinner, but the replenishment is too slow. Halfway through the time, some of the food is gone.
￼The environment is first-class, but it is a pity that the ceiling lights are too bright and discolored. The environment is nice and a**ospheric.

Breakfast: Today I went to the revolving restaurant on the 50th floor for breakfast. Looking out at the scenery in the morning made me feel good. The environment was also very comfortable. The service quality was still unbeatable👍🏻. In terms of food, it is a five-star restaurant. The breakfast buffet in star-rated hotels really needs to be improved, both in terms of style and taste.
The summary is still: it is worth my stay again. I will stay again at the end of the year. I hope the buffet dinner and breakfast buffet will be improved by then.

The water pressure is normal and there are three bottles of body wash, shampoo and conditioner.

Zhongyou independent yoga mirror room fully equipped

Excellent location, very close to Jinguanghua Plaza
Convenient transportation: Luohu Port is just one stop away by subway.

The location of the hotel is very good, there are many shopping places and restaurants nearby.
The room is very clean and the space is enough. The bathroom has a bathtub and a shower area. The bathtub is very large. My daughter had a great time taking a bath.
I am very grateful to Jason for his help. A few days before I arrived at the store, I contacted on wechat to arrange a buffet dinner at 6 o'clock, and answered many of my questions.
Also, I am very grateful to Eloise at the front desk for her help. Because after breakfast, my daughter still wants to go swimming. Seeing that there is not enough time, I try to go to the front desk to see if I can delay the check-out until 12 o'clock, and then Eloise directly helps me to delay the room By 2 o'clock, it was really great, and my daughter took a bath in the bathtub after swimming, and she had a good time!
In the end, my package ticket only included buffet dinner and buffet breakfast for two adults. I thought it was not worthwhile to pay more than 300 yuan for my daughter’s buffet, but the hotel didn’t charge any fees. That's great! My daughter and I are very satisfied with the breakfast buffet, which has many styles and tastes very good.

When I checked in, I was told that I needed 2 mobile phone charging cables and was waiting for urgent use. I was told that they would be sent to the room. However, after entering the room and waiting for 15 minutes, they still didn’t come. Call me☎️After urging at the front desk, I waited for another 10 minutes and finally they were sent to me. This is what happened today. Very disappointed with the efficiency 🙍
I don’t understand why the hotel doesn’t put charging cables in the room. Even Atour or other business-friendly hotels have the same configurations. Why is this five-star hotel lacking? I’m worried that guests may drop by or charging cables are expensive🤔
After checking in for less than 2 hours, I got a call and had to rush back to deal with things. I came to the front desk to check out and hoped that the half-day rate could be calculated. But I had no choice. I paid the room rate for one day and returned the 800 yuan deposit to leave😃 I don’t understand. I still need to collect a deposit now? Last month I went to Shanghai and stayed at Hilton and Guangzhou White Swan, but neither of them had this kind of operation...￼

Check-in was very fast and I was very lucky on my birthday. The lady at the front desk upgraded the room and extended the check-out time to 14:00. Thank you very much.

The design of the room is so warm. It's the first time I've seen such a big sofa in a hotel room. The bathroom is so beautiful. I'm most afraid of an old toilet that will feel dirty. The most praiseworthy thing is the shower gel, it smells so good ❤️

We went swimming the next morning. The swimming pool was not big, the water depth was 1.65M, and there was not much scenery to see. They were all high-rise buildings. It is worth mentioning that there is a sauna room in the locker room!!! I have been to several group-operated five-star hotels before, but none of them have sauna rooms. Isn't this amazing?

A word of caution
I went to the front desk to check in the evening. Can you help me order breakfast on ** tomorrow morning? Because I am traveling and do not have a mainland phone number, so I cannot register the **APP, but this service is not available. I hope the hotel can add some service assistance.

The hotel environment is hygienic and clean! 🥰
The location is convenient! Opposite the hotel is a shopping mall, a lot of food is in the shopping mall, and you can walk around!
The only downside is that the headrest in the bathtub cannot be used.
Breakfast is eaten at the restaurant on the 50th floor. The environment is beautiful and the food is good 👍🏻

The sound insulation of the room is very good, but there is no noise in the downtown area. Breakfast is in the revolving restaurant on the 50th floor. It seems that the breakfast time does not turn around, but the scenery is very good, and I can see my house😂Will recommend it to friends.

The room was clean and had the big bathtub I wanted. However, the bathtub was not sanitary. The dandruff is so good that I wash it again every time I take a bath and clean it deeply. Also, their breakfast buffet did not disappoint me. It is one of the best breakfasts in this area. I hope it can maintain its standard all the way. There are no surprises in this hotel, but it is really clean, comfortable and acceptable. If the price/performance ratio is more expensive among the hotels in the same area, it is the best.

Take a little time to rest. In addition, the room is very tidy and clean, and there is a big bathtub for taking a bath! The only downside is that the pillows are a bit low, and the pillows are a bit high for sleeping with two 😅The quilt is too warm, the air conditioner is not cold enough, it feels so hot halfway through sleeping, and my friends are so hot that they sweat 🤣 Overall it is good, I recommend everyone to go to Shenzhen You can live in this hotel, very close to Dongmen and Jinguanghua shopping mall. convenient!

First of all, it took a long time to check in, and I had to wait in line for almost 40 minutes. In addition, the hygiene of the room needs to be paid attention to. When I took a shower, I found that there were a lot of hairs on the water level in the bathroom, and there were even hairs that looked like boogers stuck to the wall. It was very disgusting. I hope that the hygiene situation will be better next time I check in.

The decoration design follows the traditional high-end route, mostly using art glass, natural marble and steel frame for line decoration, and the elevator lobby and corridors also use newer and more lighting effects The overall design feels noble and generous, but it is not a very high-level decoration design. Came to the room very clean and tidy,. The room is designed with light wood color as the main tone. The TV wall is equipped with black steel frame trimmings. It feels comfortable, simple and elegant, and the light is adjusted properly. There are multiple sets of light switches. The air conditioner will not be too cold. It is made of natural stones with different sizes and elegant textures. It is equipped with a free-standing bathtub made of matte artificial stone, a built-in sanitary ware faucet in the whole room, a five-fold mirror, an electronic scale, and a complete set of bathroom equipment. The room is equipped with a small bluetooth player. You can also take a bath while listening to music in the bathroom, and there is wireless charging after plugging in. The equipment in other hotels is also good. The fitness room is not too big. It is equipped with basic facilities, including treadmills, rowing machines, chest, abdomen and back equipment, and dumbbell areas. The only thing that lacks is gravity training equipment for legs. The swimming pool is relatively thin, with an ordinary curved design, which is not special, but it looks clean and reasonable, and it is okay to soak in the water in general. The restaurant dinner can be equipped with a rotating landscape buffet. The food variety is not bad, but not top-notch, for example Foie gras, sea urchin, raw oysters, toro, ready-cut steak, lamb rack, geoduck, Australian lobster, air-dried ham, etc. Not in proportion to the price, but other different foods are also good, the steak is thin, but The taste is not bad, and the fish is fresh.

Although it has been renovated, the hotel now has a strong musty smell, and the sound insulation is very poor. You can hear the door opening in the corridor and next door, which greatly affects your rest. At the same time, the service is much worse than before. When Peng Nian was the company's contract hotel, the service was very good. My experience this time was very bad. It happened that I booked two twin rooms. Later I wanted to change them to a double room and a twin room. In fact, I can change it directly on Ctrip, but when I changed it On the app, you can only choose between two queen beds or one queen bed. You can't change it to one queen bed and one twin bed. I think this is an issue with the app design. Of course, I could cancel and rebook, but I didn’t want my credit to be affected by cancellation (although it might not), so I wanted to pay the price difference at the front desk for an upgrade when I checked in. But what I didn’t expect was that the front desk insisted that there were no rooms and wouldn’t give it to me. Upgraded, but it actually shows on Ctrip that it is still available. I said that I was booking with Ctrip now. The front desk clerk who greeted me and the colleague next door said that even if you made the reservation, they would not confirm it, and told me that you can’t cancel it now (after the free cancellation time of 18:00, I checked in about (It was around 18:10) 😰 Regarding this, I actually felt a little stunned and speechless, because it was actually the first time I saw such a service attitude. But because it was my daughter’s birthday, I didn’t want to get into trouble with anyone, and I didn’t want my daughter to think that I had a dispute with someone else. Moreover, I decided that I would never choose this hotel in the future. It was just for one night anyway, so I decided He smiled and took the room card without arguing. Why choose Peng Nian? Because my previous experience and experience at Renaissance Zhuhai and Renaissance Hong Kong were very good. But in the future Peng Nian, I want to say: No!

I didn't refill the conditioner, shampoo, and shower gel when the previous guest ran out. Yes, the hot water is not hot enough. I ordered takeaway. I asked the front desk to help me get it to the elevator, but I refused. I forced myself to go down to get it. I had to go down to get it in my pajamas, and said I was going down in my pajamas. ****, I just fell asleep. Wake up to dress up to get a takeaway, just to go down to pick up the takeaway? It's amazing! When I left the store, I was waiting for Didi in the lobby, but the people from the store in the lobby came and asked me what I wanted to drink. I said no, and waited for Didi to leave immediately. The waiter told me: "You can't sit here if you don't consume!" Damn! It's really disgusting to me!

msg:First of all, I want to say: when I made a reservation through the platform, I was given a restaurant coupon, but it was not allowed to be used. After a closer look, I found that the validity period had expired, so why should I give it away? It's better not to give it away, I'm upset when I see it, but I dare to give it away after the expiration date!
I really don’t know how to evaluate it. First, let’s talk about the extremely poor air conditioning in the hotel. The room is extremely hot and cold. I don’t know if it’s because the master control is not well controlled or there is a problem with the air conditioning;    Compared with Marriott's hotel services, it is indeed the same as the previous evaluations from other platforms. The service experience is really bad. It has been a few days since the deposit was not refundable for a few days ago. I asked to send mineral water for one night. The result was not delivered, and then I called the service center to say that I would send two more bottles of mineral water, and then the staff had various restrictions, sometimes saying that only 2 bottles, sometimes saying that only 4 bottles, in short, all kinds of prevarication;    The service in the cafeteria on the 50th floor chose cold seafood. Please heat it up. The staff said that you cook the noodles yourself and asked him to heat it up. The person who cooked the noodles said that you saw that there were too many people and there was no place to heat it up. You went to find the seafood. The staff on the side, in short, are pushing each other;    The check-in at the front desk said that the room type was upgraded by a member, but the result was the same as the reserved room type, there was no difference, and then said that the next time I checked in, I would get a breakfast. When I checked in for the second time in two days, I didn’t know what happened. , The staff at the front desk actually said that our price/performance ratio is already very high compared with other hotels, you can compare it yourself, so as I said before, it is not given away now; the points have not been credited after check-out; There is no discount for consumption members in the cafeteria, and the points that should be accumulated have not been accumulated for a week. I am speechless. The front desk pushes the blame to the restaurant. The restaurant says that the front desk has paid the bill, which is their problem. I have to say that the service at the front desk should be improved. up.

msg:The Marriott is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in, and the whole family agreed that it is not worthy of a five-star hotel. You must prepare decompression medicine when staying in this hotel, because you need to call them constantly and wait for a long time.
The deposit is 800 yuan. After checking out, I called twice to remind me, and the refund was only made on the third day. Other hotels refund on the same day after checking out, so there is no need to remind me.
I called three or four times before and after the welcome fruit, and in the end only one of the three rooms was delivered, really laughing. When I asked for the third time, I said it had already been delivered. I said I was sure it hadn’t been delivered, and I also said that I would find someone to look at it. I have never seen such a search in a five-star hotel.
Mom felt that the room was stuffy, so she asked an engineer to open the window and waited for two hours. It is rare to have such low efficiency.
When we checked in, there were three rooms, one room was checked in at seven or eight in the evening, and we were told that this is the only room left in the hotel, you are better.
You don't even give me a comb, so you have to ask for it. The care package is not given, and I have to call to ask for it. I made countless phone calls in the two days I stayed, it was disgusting, the efficiency was extremely low, and I couldn't do a search! Avoid lightning! Would never live again, not even for a full season.
The breakfast is also unpalatable. My mother said it is not as good as Atour, and there is not much to eat.

The cleaner didn't even change the slippers. Also, I tied up the garbage bag and put it at the door of the room, which means that your cleaner will take it away. You told me that it cannot be placed at the door. Can't put it at the door, should I hand it to you? Put it at the door, doesn't it mean that your cleaner will take it away? Unnecessary direct contact is also avoided. Aunt cleaner, the quality is too low.

The 100 restaurant voucher is a lie. The price after using the coupon is more expensive than going to the restaurant to pay directly. Those who engage in Haotou are deceitful.

The deposit of 800 was received the next day after check-out. Business hotel, there is not even a desk in the room. The hotel and the office building share an elevator, which is very slow.

The TV interface was wrong, and it took another ten minutes for someone to deal with it before I could watch TV.

1) When entering the room, the temperature was 14.5 degrees. After complaining, the engineer came up to help and said that the panel was broken. After the adjus**ent, the staff came up and said that the room air conditioner should be turned off until the temperature rises before turning it on again. It took more than 2 hours to turn off the air conditioner before the temperature warmed up to 16 degrees.
2) The bathing water is not hot at all, and the temperature of the bathing water is not as good as the hot water in the washbasin (the lowest temperature in Shenzhen was 7 degrees that day). Combined with the ultra-low temperature of the room, it is directly chilled into a dog.
3) I have never tried to stay in a Marriott series hotel. The toiletries only have toothbrushes and body lotion, basic razors, shower caps, and combs.
4) Enlarge the middle partition door handle or it will not close the door if it is broken
As an old Luohu, Peng Nian's level is completely ashamed

The only surprise is that when you check in, you will be told that there will be renovations upstairs on weekends, and will take the initiative to help you arrange a quieter room, but that's all. There is a bathtub without bath salts and disposable bathtub bags. Extensibility is too poor. The bedside socket needs a converter, otherwise it will be very loose. The feedback from the front desk call is, doesn't your bedside have a usb interface? ? Suddenly speechless, what are you doing with this socket, decoration? The pen in the room was broken. I wanted to fill out the laundry list at first, but when I saw the pen was broken, I didn't like it, and the details were poor. It is recommended to put two floor towels in the room, one for the bathtub and one for the shower door. After taking a shower, it is still a little "far" to go to the bathtub to get the floor towel .

When I checked in, I heard from the front desk Wendy that it was newly renovated in 2019 and joined the Marriott Group. In terms of the Marriott brand, there is still much room for improvement in the standards of hardware facilities, but the service has nothing to say. Whether it's the room staff or any staff members I met while wandering around the hotel, they all greeted us with a smile and greeted us very cordially. Many times I felt like I was back to that old Pengnian. Special thanks to the front desk Wendy and Ms. Vera, who put themselves in the shoes of the guests, which is great! We have three rooms, one suite is not to mention, and the other two ordinary rooms are also arranged for us on the adjacent sunny floor. In short, the hotel gives me the feeling that the attitude is positive! Even if there are shortcomings, I am willing to improve and pay attention to the feelings of the guests. I will choose here next time!

A bunch of reasons seem to not want to purchase on the platform. I have always emphasized that this is a good experience for special room. Experience the five-star experience room of 641. I think the room should have something or something. After moving in, the room is empty and clean. For example, paper towels are the vanity table. There are no other things (such as desktop or bedside)
For washing, there are two toothbrushes and a cotton swab. If men live, they usually have a razor. For women, there is no comb at all! ! So the five-star hotel is purely for the high cost of the province. Don’t worry, this hotel doesn’t even have a comb to give you breakfast.
In the end, the attitude of the front desk staff at check-in and check-out is average

msg:During this trip to Shenzhen, I chose to stay at the Renaissance Penglin Hotel under the Marriott Group, and once again felt the happiness of home. The hotel environment is soft and natural, without publicity, but luxurious and restrained. The DAISY girls at the front desk are enthusiastic and professional, reflecting the basic qualities of the Marriott Group. The room has complete facilities and reasonable layout. The bed is very comfortable, which ensures that I have a good night's sleep every day. The transportation is convenient, and the surrounding dining facilities are complete. When I come to Shenzhen in the future, I will choose Renaissance Panglin Hotel again.

msg:I screened several hotels around, and finally chose Pang Nian Wanli,
Usually, staying in major brand hotels is all 5 points, subjectively and objectively to experience a hotel service, check in, dining, spa, fitness center and check out. Due to the tight schedule this time, I didn't experience more areas. I hope my true feelings can provide a reference for travelers who pay more attention to service experience while choosing to linger.
According to time
The service center Catharine is very good. I did not refuse my request (late check-out) at the first time. Instead, I went to apply and communicate. Even if I refused, it gave the customer buffer space. Thank her very much.
Ordered the delivery meal, the time is very high, did not wait long, the dishes taste good, the delivery boy is also very attentive, although he did not remember the name, but it is very good feeling
At noon the GRO in the lobby elevator learned of my needs, so he delivered the plate and fork to the door of the room by herself. She didn’t knock on the door rashly because of DND. She met me back and thanked her very much (also because she didn’t remember her name in a hurry, but really thankful)
The warm service is always unforgettable, and the above are all good experiences.
Why is it given 1 point? I went to the front desk around 13:15 to settle the meal. Vera at the front desk (not sure about the last 2 letters) told me that the room can only be delayed until 14:00, and I told her that the duty manager had agreed to the delay , She told me to confirm it, OK confirm it now, she said that the duty manager is not there, she will confirm to contact me later, can't you call the duty manager, or do you think I lied to you for 2 hours late check-out? Then I ran to tell you about this. There is a deposit in the room. It is not convenient for me to answer the phone later. She still insisted on contacting me later... Can’t look at the problem from the guest’s point of view, it is a soft injury. The most core thing is the tone of communication. I respect the communication. Why is the front desk staff's speech so blunt and strong, and can't listen to what I said, and insists on her knowledge to verify the contact later, yes Because I'm so easy to talk, she thinks she can communicate like this? My respect is meaningless to this employee, incredible, and I even think that she is usually used to this way of communication. I have to go to JW to stay today. Although the price is different, it belongs to a group (I can check the evaluation given by JW last time). The praise will definitely not be stingy. For those who speak well and are easily satisfied, I am willing to give good comments. Yes, you should not pay a little attention to a little bit of service or some temperature service. As of 14:20 when I write a review, I haven't contacted me, so whether I want to contact me or not, the front desk consumes so much time and finally no results.

The ordinary double bed room is also very large. The facilities are fairly new. The breakfast is average, the coffee is good, but it is very slow, upstairs dining It's also great, the bedding is comfortable, I don't know what brand, the hygiene is very good, no messy things were found, the overall price-performance ratio is very good

The breakfast was terribly poor, and the poor quality yogurt was unpalatable during the epidemic. Very unhygienic, the smell of the room is very unpleasant, the suite I live in, there is a moldy smell every day, the most important thing is that the elevator is also very old, the restaurant has few dishes, and it is strongly recommended not to live

The room is not big, the big bed room is ok for one person, the facilities are new and clean, and the bathtub is very comfortable. The first time I stayed at the hotel, I didn't find the shower cap and comb, because I checked in at 6 o'clock in the morning and checked out, so I didn't want to disturb the housekeeping depar**ent late at night. It's a pity that I ordered breakfast, but the opening time is 7:00, I have no luck to taste it.

The large sofa in the room, the large screen TV, the toiletries, the Bluetooth speaker with wireless charging, the light a**osphere, are all my favorite. It is very close to walking to Dongmen Pedestrian Street, about 8 minutes. Only downside was there was no drinks in the mini fridge but it was a great value for money hotel!

酒店整體嚟講每一樣嘢都好好。
只係唯獨是房間裏嘅浴缸熱水不夠熱，有待酒店改善。￼￼
尤其是酒店房間裏面電視機可以接收到無線翡翠台。
下次會再度入住。
其實酒店裏面個工作人員都好好，好熱情。亦都會好主動，有什麼可以幫到你。
大家可以考慮入住這間酒店。

餘彭年的個人經歷和電影金手指的原型陳松青挺像，都是堪稱傳奇，彭年萬麗在羅湖區算得上是老牌五星級酒店，附近有個金光華商場，步行到東門老街也就10分鐘左右的路程。
這家酒店在羅湖的地理位置很好，交通便利，下榻這個酒店的香港人很多，客房裡的設施也算不錯，畢竟是萬豪旗下的，品質有一定保證。

第二天早上吃早餐，50層沒位置，讓人家到51層，餐廳人員有沒有考慮到帶著小孩跑上跑下去領食物是多麽不方便。

所以說硬件是絕對稱得上5星，服務有待改善。

酒店位置還挺方便，羅湖口岸坐地鐵一個站就到了，國貿站A出口經過金光華商場直走就是，如果迷路的話，抬頭看看高空上有無有一個球型+圓形的觀景平台，朝著它走就好！

酒店門前十字路口往左邊直走約5分鐘就有很多小攤，食店，晚上餓了也一定可以滿足到你！

房間內的裝修很好很舒服，比較不好的是房門隔音不行，不幸遇著旁邊房間半夜開關門次數多很影響睡眠。
第二天跟酒店反映問題要求換另一個房間，把空調調好，就睡得好。
總體來說我是滿意服務水平的，是那個關門聲音酒店方要想想辦法。

整體來講，羅湖彭年萬麗酒店在我心目中的地位一直沒變，下次Staycation應該還是我的首選。
