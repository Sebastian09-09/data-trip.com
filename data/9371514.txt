The tables, chairs and sofas are all good. The small and exquisite experience is quite good.

The youthful feeling and design sense are still straight to the full. The overall comfort is good.
But the air conditioning is not too powerful. It is very hot during the transition from spring to summer.

The parking lot is very good. There is still plenty of parking space.
The facilities are quite good and are not inferior to any mall.
The setting of all free is still the same. The price-performance ratio is very good.

msg:The overall feeling of the hotel is very good, with mirror design, relatively complete gym equipment, and Bluetooth speakers in the room. The only shortcoming is that there is no air conditioning! The room is stuffy and hot, completely different from the first and second floors. Sleeping on a thick big bed, I was almost crazy with heat!

The service of the ladies at the front desk and the gentleman who received me at night when I arrived at the store was also very good. But when a male waiter asked him about the use of the washing machine (he was just about to go out at that time), he said strangely that I was occupying the washing machine and asked me to take it out quickly? ? ? Asked the staff to take out my clothes immediately. What does it mean? Why do guests intentionally occupy the washing machine? ? He also said that the washing program is set, don't press other buttons, I followed the operation displayed on the washing machine, and it turned out that there was no problem, (I can feel that he obviously doesn't know how to use it) Such service quality really gave the hotel's overall service a bad review.
Also, I went to the restaurant for dinner at night. I finally ordered fried rice and ate a hair. The waiter was polite and gave me a free bill.

msg:This is one of my more severe reviews, and it is also one of the few criticisms of Yachen Yueju in recent years. Compared with the multiple experiences of friends and family in the past five years, it is good. However, it is precisely this comparison that makes the unpleasant experience encountered this time more prominent. After my family checked in, I would visit them every day and ask the front desk staff to help me use the elevator. This was also a common situation when I visited relatives and friends before. It was very unexpected that the service staff refused to help one day. The reason was simple. Security registration was required. It happened that I did not carry my ID card. I contacted my family through the front desk and confirmed my identity. After confirming my identity, they still refused to help. I said that my family had been staying for a week. When I visited every day, I did the same thing every day to avoid the trouble of picking up the elders. Still no result. And I was told that this was an illegal operation. I did not have more doubts about the rules and regulations, nor did I pursue the hotel for not making concessions and flexible handling. Instead, I was angry and questioned the hotel staff's unprofessional operation of the industry. We can be sure that there is no hotel in the world that "can meet all customer requirements". The difference is, when you face the guests' requirements that cannot be met, how do you deal with it? The basic principle is to establish a benign channel of understanding. For the management, its significance lies in that I always stand with my customers and work together to solve problems. When the customer's requirements are beyond the scope, it is more important to build this bridge of understanding. At this time, there are two attitude choices: 1. I can't meet your requirements because it is beyond my scope. 2. I'm sorry that I can't help you. Let's see if there are other ways to improve this situation. There is a fundamental difference between the two. The former is the executor of the rules, but cold and passive; the latter is the provider of services, gentle but active. The latter is precisely the fundamental logic of the industry. This is also the inherent reason for the differences between different hotels. Unfortunately, this time, I got the former experience.

From the time we stopped the car to the time we finished moving our things, it took no more than five minutes. The receptionist told Xini that he was not scolding us, but our driver. Who told him that he was our driver? That's my relative! Can the driver just scold me casually? ? ? Secondly, the room was very dusty, there was a lot of dirt on the countertop, and there was a lot of dust under the bedside table and on the floor. The front desk assigned us a room in the corner. The whole layout was strange, but we didn't pick on it, so it didn't matter. Finally, my mother lives in another room, and I will post pictures of what happened in her room below.

msg:This is a pet friendly hotel. I arrived at night with my dog, very satisfied and cost-effective. The room was also upgraded 😄 (cleaning fee 200 yuan + 100 yuan per night) to help deliver luggage, the service is thoughtful and fast!

I saw that the bedding was put away and cleaned when other rooms were cleaned up. There are service staff who help clean up every day, and it feels very clean.

You can order takeout, call the front desk, and the robot will deliver the meal, which is very fast.

🏨The ceiling of the hotel 👍 is hygienic and clean, with a beautiful environment, especially with local characteristics. From the room to the lighting and music in the public area, it is very comfortable and pleasant. In addition, the service of each staff member is excellent. Kaia at the check-in front desk is warm and thoughtful, and carefully helps with luggage. The bed in the room is very comfortable, and the facilities and facilities are carefully complete (ironing machine, umbrella...). In short, the ceiling of the hotel is great 👍Business is booming^_^

msg:When I entered the store, I found that the bedding was not changed on the bedside. I need to replace the card placed on the bed. It should be for consecutive guests, right? The light broke in the middle of the night and couldn't be turned off. I thought it was because I couldn't find the switch. I was waiting for someone to fix it. The repairman was very nice and delayed my sleep. However, the front desk showed no apology or intention to compensate. When I checked in, I was given two drink coupons, but It's completely unusable. There's no one on the second floor. The first floor doesn't let you use the toilet. The trash can is placed under the sink. What should I do if I'm on my period? I couldn’t find the trash can 🥲

The hotel is very quiet. The only thing is that the security guard at the door is not good enough. He saw us getting off the taxi so close and did not take the initiative to come. If you can help, even just open a door for the lady and her luggage, don't bother your old man. He would just stand at the door, look at us, and then open the door. This is a hotel that costs more than 1,000 yuan, not a few hundred dollars.

1. The central air conditioner in the hotel is an old-fashioned type. The air conditioner is not turned on when the cold and warm periods alternate. However, the temperature in the room is obviously a bit high after the sun shines during the day, which makes the body feel uncomfortable.
2. The bed is the most uncomfortable I have ever slept in in a hotel. When you lie down, you sink in. It is really not comfortable. I didn't sleep well for two nights

The drinks in the room in "Picture 4" are ordered by mobile phones and delivered by robots. "Picture 2" There is a double chair originally designed at the ceiling level in the elevator room of each room floor, which is comfortable! "Picture 3" There are many windows in the room and there is plenty of sunlight! There are a few points that I hope can be optimized. When cleaning, the floor should be mopped up, not just vacuuming. Pulling stools in the restaurant on the second floor is too noisy, so thicken the foot stickers.

Vehicles can be parked at the hotel B4, but the hotel basement is very narrow, so be careful when driving. This hotel is also pet-friendly Hotel, but you need to pay a cleaning fee of 100 yuan per night and a first-time check-in fee of 200 yuan. If you stay more than seven days in a row, you can reduce the fee. The overall decoration and layout of the room is biased towards the apar**ent type.

msg:Others who have stayed at this hotel would be wise to check your credit card statements to see if you were defrauded of your deposit. When I checked into the hotel, I persuaded my parents to buy breakfast for 3 days, totaling 708 yuan, and paid POS directly. Then a deposit of 1,000 yuan was collected when checking in, and the deposit was not refunded after normal check-out. Ten days later, my family asked me to call the hotel reservation depar**ent to ask for a deposit. The person in the reservation depar**ent lied and claimed that they had checked the account and deducted the cost of breakfast from the deposit. The balance of 292 was refunded to the credit card on the day of check-out. My family showed me the credit card record and said that was not the case at all. I called the reservation depar**ent and asked to confront their supervisor. The supervisor supported the front desk employee's statement without verifying it. I said that your employee was lying to me. There is proof of card swiping that you charged repeatedly, and there is no refund of 292. The supervisor named Tian was dissatisfied and went to check the account. After I expressed my dissatisfaction several times with the reservation depar**ent for taking advantage of guests' trust to defraud money without refunding the deposit, he still thought it was nothing and refunded the deposit when I found out. I'm ready. I was shocked by this hotel's disregard for integrity. If my father hadn't been more careful, he would have been defrauded of 1,000 yuan.

Check-in desk
The front desk staff doesn't know what the strong local discrimination is. I won't go into details. You can feel it yourself if you want to stay. There was a smell as soon as I entered the room. The toothbrush, a disposable consumable item, had lint. I didn’t dare to brush hard. There were no cotton swabs.
I didn't have anything I wanted. I asked if there were any eggs for my birthday. The front desk said there was nothing they could do.
Communicated with the restaurant and asked us to go to their restaurant and buy it for ten yuan each.
Except for the toothbrushes provided, there are no basic daily hotel facilities. The rooms are comparable to those of express chain hotels in third-tier cities and may not be as good as other hotels. They at least respect every guest who stays and provide as much as possible.
Excellent service and basic supplies (the picture below is the lobby

There is a bar and simple kitchen facilities in the room (microwave oven, induction cooker, tableware, etc.), and there is a free laundry room on the first floor of the hotel. The waiting area of the laundry room is also designed to be very comfortable online. Outside the window is the City of Nations. The green landscape of the community, there is a nucleic acid detection point at the entrance of the hotel, which is very convenient. The cocktails and summer special drinks provided by the package are also good👍, and there are 6-8 packages for breakfast that are made to order and are OK.
Five-star recommendation, especially for business people

msg:The accommodation experience in July, I forgot to comment, the location is OK, the service feels so-so, quite satisfactory. The front desk service is relatively passive, but it's acceptable, and the room amenities are not bad. The logo of the breakfast restaurant is not very obvious, an open lounge feeling, but there is no lead, it is too open. Perhaps it is also the reason for the lack of manpower.
The whole design style also tends to be artistic, which is very relaxing, but more feelings are just that. Compared with the same price, the cost performance is lower.
There's nothing great about it, but I'll give it a good review anyway.

I am happy~ The location is good, and the parking lot is free, which is really a conscience. When I checked in, I upgraded the room type for free. It happened to be a corner room facing the airport expressway and moma. I personally think it has the best view. The bed is very comfortable, moderately soft and firm, and the bathrobe is also very comfortable. The minibar is free, so don't ask for so many other things, it is an apar**ent hotel after all. The fly in the oin**ent is that the guy at the front desk is a bit utilitarian. If he had to choose, I would naturally choose, and it would be useless to persuade me not to choose. In short, the experience is still very good.

This spirit is very commendable! But when I got back to the hotel, the room card actually didn't work, and I didn't put it near my phone, which made me speechless, and I had to make my wife go for a trip with a big belly! At night, I found that there was a very thin security guard at the door. He didn't even know how to open the door and sat there playing with his mobile phone. I didn't know what the situation was and how the staff training was done!

Okay, I went back to bed and found no place where USB can be plugged in. What age is there in USB... I stopped playing with my phone and went to sleep.
Because the street is quite noisy, I woke up early, cleaned up and went downstairs to work, wow this place must take a taxi 40 minutes earlier in the morning, brothers
I came to the lobby to take a taxi. The ladies at the front desk (little aunts), would you like to keep quiet at home? I really don’t want to hear the story of you distributing mooncakes. I was very anxious when I couldn’t get a taxi...

msg:A piece of the floor was obviously dirty. The cleaning was very inconsistent. I didn't mop the floor at all. It was late. Then I said that the cleaning was off work at 4pm, and there was no way to clean it... Rolling curtains were difficult to pull, and they were almost out of place. The breakfast is really terrible... Youtiao is actually cold... I have been on a business trip several times. If I rely on the airport expressway, there will be very very noisy traffic. Basically, I will give you a toothbrush or something. Nothing. Then I came to the room and thought about what I wanted. I had to wait a long, long time before it was delivered. The cleaning was very noisy in the corridor in the morning. It was really not a five-star hotel...
The advantage is that parking is free and robots deliver food.

msg:This hotel is at best the environment of a comfortable hotel and the services of a budget hotel. If you explain clearly to the front desk, you have to make things complicated, and you don't even think about the guest's need to sleep.
It was also on the day of check-out. I had something to do the night before and did not go back to the hotel until the morning. The hotel reception started calling more than 11 o'clock. Late check-out till 2 o'clock. Three calls were made in the middle. Go downstairs and check out at 3:30 after negotiation. We walked to the front desk about 7 minutes late. The front desk is mandatory to charge a half-day room rate. If there is no discussion, it is a big city.
Nearly 400 house prices in 7 minutes. This hotel is awesome. You say he is comfortable, the purple-haired little brother's attitude is uncomfortable. Let's talk about economy. The price is too exaggerated.
Very poor check-in experience! ! ! It's impossible to come again. This is the first time I saw such a reminder to check out and forcibly charge an extra room fee. You look pretty stingy 7 minutes late, okay?

msg:From before I checked in, the hotel said that because I arrived late, I needed to guarantee the first night’s room rate. Note that this is the first time I communicated with me on the phone. I said that the guarantee is OK, but because I booked through Ctrip, I hope that Ctrip will find it. I guarantee; the second time Ctrip communicated with me that it was because I needed a late check-out, so I had to guarantee it. My late check-out was not requested by me but was automatically generated by the platinum membership rights, even if it was not very pleasant before check-in; this The price of the location is indeed quite reasonable in Beijing. The hotel is a semi-apar**ent behavior. Because it is relatively new, it is also very clean. In the morning I finally checked out by phone and the front desk confirmed that I can check out until 2 o’clock in the afternoon. There is no problem when I go upstairs at noon. The room card can’t be swiped. Ask the front desk to first question whether I have taken the card. I repeatedly emphasized that I can’t get the card wrong if I haven’t removed the card. The girl at the front desk unexpectedly said that if the card is wrong, it’s the first one. I couldn't go up, and I was completely speechless until she inquired that the room card was invalid because the system forgot to delay for me. So I ask you to see if there is a problem with your own when you question the guests? ? ? Of course, there can be no high hopes for such a hotel, please refer to it.

msg:The reception at the front desk is extremely bad, as long as check-out is delayed for more than ten minutes, a half-day room charge will be charged. Strongly not recommended. When you check out, tell me that you will be charged a parking fee if you don’t show up for more than ten minutes after registration. It’s too good. Everything in your house is ten minutes. It should be renamed Ten Minutes Hotel.
