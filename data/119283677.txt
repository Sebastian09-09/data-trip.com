msg:It is definitely the ceiling of Fuxian Lake B&B, with an unbeatable lake view and 200 meters away from the lake. The owner has great taste and insight, and it perfectly combines simplicity and modernity. It has strong privacy and is not the simple Santorini style of Internet celebrities. I don't want to leave when I live here. Kunming Airport is only a 1-hour drive away. It is a good place to relax and unwind. I will go there again.

msg:The hotel is very beautiful! The rooms are super big, and they all have a large balcony facing the lake. They are clean, quiet, and full of casual vacation feeling, which makes people feel very comfortable. It is very close to bring children to play in the water. You can cross the road to the waterside. The water is clear and there are few people. Children can pick up stones, throw stones and play with sand. When they are tired, they can cross the road and go back to the room to lie down and sleep! It can be called the most comfortable homestay by the water! And all the brothers are very enthusiastic. The hotel is located halfway up the mountain. You have to take a special small car to go up. The children are very happy! Love it! The next step is to make an appoin**ent with friends and family, and plan to book it for two or three days!

msg:This homestay is definitely the biggest surprise of this trip. The customer service helped us upgrade the room type with a terrace bathtub. The room is well designed and has a super large screen projection. I had a delicious copper pot fish in the evening, looked at Fuxian Lake and took a hot bath. It was really comfortable.

msg:1. The kids like this B&B very much. They especially like the boss's dog, Jixiang.
2. The view of the lake is good! The environment and style of the B&B are beautiful! The breakfast is also delicious. The small fruits sent are also very good. The service is also good.
3. Minor shortcomings: a little high and steep. The smart light control is on in the middle of the night...
Overall very satisfied!

msg:The B&B is newly opened, and the experience is very good. The design of the room is very good, and the whole house is full of smart things. The view is also very good, which should be one of the best in Fuxian Lake. 👍👍👍The boss and all the staff are very enthusiastic. They helped to carry the luggage upstairs as soon as I arrived. Welcome fruits and cakes, coffee drinks were also given after check-in, which is very considerate. Every part of the hotel is designed very specially. Every room has a lake view. You can relax in the hotel for a whole day. Another great thing is that they also provide ethnic costumes for residents to take pictures for free. It is very thoughtful. I will go there again next time I have the chance.

msg:The environment is consistent with the room pictures. I like the decoration style very much. The various facilities are beautifully arranged. It is very clean and hygienic. You can check in with confidence. The B&B is by the Fuxian Lake, overlooking the scenery of Fuxian Lake, and there is a direct bus. The sound insulation is good, the air conditioning is cool, and I slept very well all night. Next time, I will choose this boutique B&B again.

msg:This is a newly opened boutique B&B with a wild and luxurious feel. It is located halfway up the mountain, just over 100 meters from the lake. You can walk to the lake. The room facilities are very complete and high-end. The lake view is really unbeatable. I have stayed in many lake view B&Bs in Fuxian Lake, and this one is one of the best. The service staff is also very enthusiastic and received us like friends. The coffee in the cafe is also delicious.

msg:A newly opened internet-famous homestay with a super good environment and an amazing lake view. It is said that every room has a lake view, which is suitable for internet celebrities to check in. It is no exaggeration to say that it is the most beautiful homestay. The public area is large, suitable for vacation, relaxation and taking photos. The staff are also very enthusiastic. It feels like visiting a friend's home. The facilities and equipment are all international brands, and the price is super value and very cost-effective.

msg:“一座民宿一座城”，一抹藍很好的詮釋出來了。早就想來撫仙湖看看，在攜程看到這家新開的民宿一下子就喜歡上了它。也是因為它愛上了撫仙湖。本來是想在玉溪和普洱兩個城市選一個，看見“一抹藍”決定來撫仙湖玩。一到酒店就感覺比攜程上看到的介紹還要美，而且從老闆到員工非常熱情、友好，在這裏連住了四晚，體驗感太好了。每個房間都面朝湖景，撫仙湖的美一覽無餘。環境優美，花花草草佈置的很雅緻。還有一個懸崖咖啡廳，咖啡好喝，每天有不少年輕人來喝咖啡、打卡拍照。位置在撫仙湖最美的地方，離湖二百米左右，可以走到湖邊散步。房間設施舒適、完善。還寧靜，我們每晚都休息的很好。早餐也精緻美味。就餐環境太美了。每個工作人員都特別好，非常感謝你們！想特別感謝一下劉經理，沒少給他添麻煩，謝謝！“一抹藍”它的美、它的好真不是三言兩語就能描述出來的，讓客人願為一座民宿而奔赴一座城，他們做到了！
