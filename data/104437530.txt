msg:Environment: The hotel's decoration design is aesthetically pleasing. Whether it is the small courtyard or the flower arrangement in the restaurant, it is artistic and worth appreciating. The overall design is relatively new and very clean and tidy.

Service: Every boss in the store (I think they are all bosses) is very friendly, especially the tall lady who serves tea in the evening. Her smile is very contagious.

Food: The focus is on afternoon tea. The appearance and taste are both online. I like osmanthus black tea and tangerine peel melon seeds very much. I also order meals here. Although the price is higher than that of restaurants outside, the environment and hygiene are friendly. I have to say that Jiuhua bamboo shoots fried meat and the small cold dishes of snow vegetables and fresh bamboo shoots in the morning are really delicious😋

The service is very good, and you feel at home.

We chose to eat all three dinners in the B&B because the taste is good, the environment is comfortable, the food is clean and safe, and there are nine dishes and one soup every day, and there are no repeats for three days.

msg:It was my first time here and it happened to be snowing. The housekeeper was very considerate and had already turned on the air conditioner for us in advance. I instantly felt that it was not cold outside. The work area always prepared hot tea, which was really considerate.
Although it snowed, the facilities of the homestay were great. There were not only air conditioners but also floor heating. The most important thing was that the hot water was turned on and it was not affected by the weather outside at all. It was very nice.
The room was tall and grand, completely star-rated, clean, simple and warm. I was surprised by the mask. The fruit in the room was also high-end. It was not like the kind of fruit that was only put in for the sake of meaning. It was an absolute conscience homestay, recommended.
The homestay was a street in Jiuhua Mountain, and there were also temples. It was no problem to play for a few hours. It was also very convenient to go to other scenic spots. It was recommended to take the bus to reach each scenic spot directly.
I used to like to live outside the scenic area. This time, the quality of the homestay in the scenic area was really good, saving a lot of time to play. Finally, the breakfast and special dishes of the homestay were good and delicious 😋. I will still make a wish next time. I hope everyone who comes to Jiuhua Mountain will make their wish come true.

About the service:
The first warmth I felt when I came to Jiuhua Mountain was given by the store brother, who came to pick us up on the roadside with super enthusiasm. He was really enthusiastic and good!

Pet-friendly:
There is a little Corgi fries in the store, which is really fat and cute. You can pet the dog for free🌞

Restaurant🍴:
The auntie’s cooking is really delicious😋, you can see it from the pictures without saying too much, it is really appetizing

Location: Opposite is the Flesh Palace, which can be seen directly from the back mountain of the B&B. It is amazing to take photos there~

爬山回來，工作人員會熱心備好下午茶，有一天管家看我們淋了雨，還專門煮了熱騰騰的薑茶給端上樓。感受到賓至如歸的周到服務。早餐很貼心，豆漿很香。晚上累了就在酒店吃，提前跟前台點好，廚房做好才叫我們下樓去吃。廚房阿姨的廚藝很贊，完全滿足我們的口味需求。最後一天，老闆和工作人員還專門起個大早，開車送我們到下山車站，讓我們非常感動。第一次遇到這麼温暖貼心的民宿，是我們的幸運，也是地藏菩薩加持的緣分，感恩遇見！也感謝攜程平台的推薦！

聽老闆娘介紹，她家還有親子房的，下次帶上小朋友再來。

早早地預訂了民宿，農曆新年第一天，九華山真的是人山人海，車子衹能停在山下，坐上大巴車，老闆娘開車來接我們。恰逢新年，山上張燈結綵，燈火輝煌，到處都是人人人人人人🐰🐰🐰🐰
民宿裝修的很棒，後面還有一個超大的泳池，燈光也很暖，管家小哥哥長得很帥氣，老闆娘服務非常熱情，店裡有地暖一點也不冷，還有火爐，喝一口熱乎的紅茶，早早的去排隊敬香。好久沒有看到這麼熱鬧的景象了，沒有疫情的春節，感覺真的太棒了。願所求皆如願，新的一年平安健康，一路順，路路順。
最後感謝大美女老闆娘一家的熱情款待！
