msg:The hotel was not so welcoming to me as a non chinese speaker. The receptiondesk and restaurant did not even greet me and only spoke to my chinese friend. The restaurant food was not so fresh and the sausage was undercooked. Granted, they replaced this with two new ones. It is not as good as other Ritz Hotels i have stayed at in the past. Tianjin is much better. I would like to see this hotel upgraded to be in line with other excellent Ritz hotels across China.

msg:One more thing to add, his Golden Pavilion restaurant is expensive and has small portions. The key is that it is not delicious. The price does not match the quality and taste, and it is probably a five-star brand. A piece of wagyu beef is only as big as a palm. The very old bean sprouts used in the soup were far inferior to the bean sprouts I ate at Siji Minfu the next day, but the price was several times higher. Fried rice is about 350. Freshly squeezed orange juice was not on the menu, so I ordered a bunch. After looking at the price, it seemed that it was 450 without the service charge, which worked out to about 100 a cup. The waiter emphasized to me that his juice is squeezed from real oranges. Made me laugh. Shouldn’t freshly squeezed orange juice be squeezed from oranges? What to use? Brain? Give five points for the waiter's admirable serious expression, and negative points for the rest.

It was already very late when I arrived at the hotel. As soon as I entered the door, I saw that the bed was turned down. The room was large and warm. I took off my clothes and washed up and fell into the soft quilt. It was very comfortable. It's very quiet, I had a very solid sleep all night, and the bedding has a nice touch.
Breakfast is delicious, my favorite is the cinnamon danish and noodle soup. All the dishes at the Chinese stall are delicious, and the milk is also very hot. The chicken for lunch is also delicious, and there are many kinds of fruits that I like to eat.
Thanks for taking care of me, I delayed check-out for a while and took a shower. The toiletries smelled very good. I felt very satisfied with every aspect of my stay.
The attitude of the service staff is also very good. The gentleman at the door opens the door promptly every time.

msg:The room size is relatively large among Beijing hotels. I booked a basic room, but the front desk thoughtfully chose a room on a high floor. Because I arrived relatively early, I originally thought I would have to wait, but unexpectedly the front desk was very helpful in finding a room. The orientation of the room is very good, and the night view is also good. The hotel is quite old and needs to be updated in all aspects. I hope the tea bags in the room can be upgraded to a higher level, and they are also Ritz at least. The Chris**as a**osphere in the lobby is very good and the decoration is very warm. Will stay again. Thank you to Steven at the front desk for arranging the room.

You could see the traffic on Financial Street from the room. The signature cocktail in the bar on the second floor of the hotel is very delicious. It costs 128 a cup. After drinking it, you can go directly upstairs to sleep.
Steven's service at the front desk was standard and gentlemanly. It was obvious that he was an experienced professional hotelier who was warm, thoughtful, professional and reliable.
In general, although Xilisi is a bit old, it is still very comfortable to live in because it is decorated in Chinese style and does not look very old.

When I entered the lobby, a light fragrance hit my face and made me relax instantly. The room was furnished with comfort and sophistication, everything seemed so perfect. The bed was soft and comfortable, the pillows were just the right height and firmness, and I fell asleep quickly.
The hotel's breakfast is rich and varied, with fresh juices, delicious breads and various snacks to whet your appetite. I sat by the window, admiring the city scenery outside the window, enjoying the tranquility and beauty.
I left the hotel feeling extremely satisfied. I wrote a detailed hotel review describing every aspect of the hotel, from the layout of the room to the quality of the breakfast, from the attitude of the service staff to the hotel facilities. I believe every detail was captured by me and expressed my love and appreciation for the hotel.

msg:The hotel is old and poorly maintained. Once you enter the room, there is a musty smell. The faucet and the floor of the shower are full of scale and mold. After calling the front desk for half an hour, no one came to deal with it. Later, a cleaning lady came to communicate and had no solution that day, saying that she could only change the room the next day. After the manager on duty came up, he still didn't solve the problem. He brought up a fruit plate and pretended to smile. The fruit was still rotten (Figure 5). The next day, there was still no staff who took the initiative to change the room for us. After asking again, we changed to another room of the same room type. The problem still exists. When checking out, the front desk did not have any words of apology, nor did they ask about their feelings and feedback during the stay. This trip was very tiring, and I didn't have the energy to argue with the hotel. I raised three questions and still couldn't solve them, so I had to endure it. The famous Ritz or this very bad experience is even more exhausting. Anyway, Diptyque's shampoo is quite easy to use.

Franck Muller’s watch was also missing, and the disposable underwear he bought ended up in the handbag. It’s been there. It’s one of the most outrageous things this year.

msg:When I arrived at the store at midnight, Ms. Grace of the hotel seemed to understand the exhaustion of my friends and me. For our convenience, she asked if I needed to help me adjust to the same executive floor as my friends for free, and then warmly gave me a free breakfast. The executive floor is of course comfortable, and the breakfast is exquisite and convenient, but it is warm and sincere to consider the needs of the other party from the perspective of the guests. In an increasingly indifferent and practical era, it is rare for the Ritz Financial Street to maintain its sincerity. It is inseparable from the selection and training of the management company. It also allows the exhausted and desolate body and mind of the business trip to encounter an oasis, and vaguely recalls living in it many years ago. The beauty of the Ritz Carlton on the Cote d'Azur. Thank you!

The hotel consciously laid out towels. The biggest problem is that the hotel's facilities are generally set in Western style. My height is 175, and the bed is relatively high, so I can't wait to jump, because I am afraid that the child will turn over and fall off. The height of the toilet is set in European style, which is very high and uncomfortable.

msg:I checked into room 618 at 10:30 p.m. on August 6 this month with my child. After entering the room, I found a puddle of water at the door of the toilet. When I passed by, I slipped and almost fell! When I made a call, I found that there was no dial tone on the phone, and I had to press the speakerphone to make a call. The phone buttons were full of old dust for many years. After calling room service, I was urged 3 times in total, and the cleaning staff came after 30 minutes. After looking at it, she directly said: "This is the air conditioner leaking. I saw that it was still dripping, and they gave it to the guest before it was repaired." Helpless, I asked to change the room, and I changed to room 1707. After such a steaming, the child didn't fall asleep until 12:30 in the morning! ! ! When I took a shower, I found that the bathroom door was not closed tightly, and the water seeped outside. The water boiled in the kettle had a smell, and the fire hood was in the upper room of the bed, and there were two small light holes every other. It flashes once a second, and every time I wake up, it's really scary! ! ! The air conditioner in the room must be cooled to 19 degrees, otherwise the whole room will have a musty smell that has not been ventilated for a long time! ! ! Considering the child's feelings, I endured the problem of room 1707 for 2 days until I checked out at 10:00 am on August 8th. Among them, the hotel also charged 1,500 yuan for extra consumption on my WeChat, saying that it can be refunded after check-out. Among them, I ordered a fruit plate for my child. Since I checked out, I have not received the remaining payment. This time, the Ritz-Carlton in Beijing's Financial Street has a very poor experience. Such careless service and such old facilities seem to be living in a hotel in the 90s. .

msg:The Ritz-Carlton brand has always given me a quality and service-oriented hotel. This time I came to Beijing to attend my daughter's graduation ceremony, and I chose the Ritz-Carlton because I wanted to live more comfortably. Before coming, I have confirmed that the room can be checked in at 2 o'clock because I am going to the university soon. When we arrived, we didn't actually check in until 2 to 3 o'clock. Tell the registrant that we are waiting in the coffee shop in front of the front desk, but we still have to go to the front desk to say that it is ready. The room is old, and the bathroom leaks heavily on the floor, which poses a great safety hazard. The equipment is outdated. The sanitation is very average, and many things can be seen that have not been cleaned for a long time. No toothbrush or toothpaste. The storage bag, I searched for a long time and couldn't find it. No service to speak of at all. The overall experience is like paying a 5-star price and providing 2-3 star services. Hope the management puts more effort into improving the customer experience.

msg:I checked in on 10.3 and planned to leave Beijing on 10.4. However, in the early morning of 10.4, I found that the health treasure pop-up window was caused by the adjus**ent of the prevention and control policy of the departure point to Beijing. I reported to the hotel in time to apply for an emergency departure from Beijing. After the declaration, the hotel informed that it needs to be changed to the control room on the 3rd floor and waited. It also informed that the pop-up window can be dismissed in the afternoon after reporting in the morning, and it will be processed within 24 hours at the latest. Immediately went to the replacement room to self-isolate, and found that the room was poorly hygienic, messy and incompletely equipped, and reluctantly endured it because it was expected to clear the pop-up window and go to the airport in the afternoon. But until the night of 10.4, when there was no time to leave Beijing and return to Shanghai, the pop-up window was still not dismissed, and the hotel asked to continue staying in the room at the original price. After reflecting that the quality of the room is extremely poor (it has only been used for isolation for several months) and it is impossible to enjoy any hotel services during the isolation period, it is agreed to give appropriate discounts and free breakfast (but it has not been fulfilled, yes, it is said but not done). Until the morning of 10.5 the next day, we continued to actively communicate with the hotel to cancel the pop-up window and leave Beijing, but the problem still could not be solved. After I communicated with the airport and learned that the pop-up personnel could sign a letter of commi**ent to leave Beijing, I communicated with the hotel again, but at first I tried everything possible to obstruct it. For example, I am in home isolation, but I have made it clear that I need to leave Beijing urgently and the hotel does not have the isolation conditions (need to provide on-site nucleic acid test but the hotel does not have it), or I cannot take public transportation (actually there are 48h nucleic acid available), etc. I agreed to leave the store only after I saw a tough attitude. The commi**ent signed when I left the store was a standard template for long-term use, and it was not prepared for special circumstances (it was fooled again). After I went to the airport, I filled in the materials according to the epidemic prevention regulations and returned to Shanghai. Until 5:00 pm on 10.5, the problem of the health treasure pop-up window that the hotel assisted in the declaration has not been resolved.
Summary: The hotel not only does not help the guests to leave Beijing as soon as the epidemic prevention regulations allow, and delays the original itinerary, but also forces them to continue staying in the isolation room with extremely poor conditions at the market price. This behavior is the most contemptible among the hotels I have stayed in so far.

The air conditioner operating system is terrible, choose warm air, still cold air. Turn off the air conditioner, still continue to blow the wind. I called the room attendant to check it, and told me that it was like this, and the air would still be blowing when the air conditioner was turned off, so there was nothing wrong with it. On the next morning, without doing anything, the air supply stopped by itself.

The breakfast is expensive and not delicious, there are many people in line, can't we have a bigger breakfast room? The tofu nao is too old and there are no chives.

There are some problems with staying a few times during the epidemic, but I can understand that the service has lagged behind due to the epidemic. I have never given a bad review. This time, people have to give it. The epidemic has passed. I charged the most expensive hotel in Financial Street, but I still gave the worst hotel service. Because I am used to it, I still choose the Ritz every time. But now this hotel It is definitely the worst Ritz I have ever lived in. On the first day of check-in, a pillowcase in the room was obviously not replaced. After that, every day, the room equipment is either missing this or that. It's nothing. In the end, I was charged an extra day for the house bill. If I didn't notice it, I would have charged it. Ask the staff. There is no attitude that any five-star hotel should have, let alone the attitude of admitting mistakes that Ritz should have. Suggestions were made without any reply or explanation. Really amazing.

msg:I stayed for five nights in total, and the waiter forgot to clean the room the next day. As a result, I had to go to the front desk to remind me to clean up every day when I went out, because I was afraid to come back and see the mess during the holiday.
In addition, there are few varieties of breakfast and it is not delicious. If it is not included, it is recommended to go out to eat, but the waiters in the restaurant are quite good.

There are several problems: the toilet in the room smells bad, the shower door cannot be closed and the water flows to the ground outside, the bathroom is very cold, and the refrigerator is broken. Later, when it was adjusted to 17F, there was still a problem: the toilet tank kept flowing, and then it was fine by manually lifting the tank cover. The cat's eye is also not good, hey, disappointed.
In terms of soft services, it is also a big disappoin**ent.

I went to the basement in the morning, but the hotel locked the basement glass door for epidemic prevention. I couldn't get the car. I called for half an hour before they opened the door. They also had to confirm the room number with me before they opened it for me. ***** delayed my trip. I will not stay there again.

msg:Beijing Ritz-Carlton is really far from Nanjing Ritz. Disappointed from the moment we entered the hotel. No one opened the door at the door of the hotel. I was alone with three bags and pushed the door to enter; the check-in attitude at the front desk was extremely indifferent; I didn’t bring a charging cable with me when I was on a business trip, so I told them that I didn’t, so I could only rent a power bank, which is provided by chain hotels now; breakfast is at On the first floor, there are very few varieties. I didn’t pay attention to the suite I booked, and I found out that there was only one set in the morning (not to blame the hotel, I was careless) so I packed an extra set, only gave two boxes, I packed 2 buns and a bowl of porridge + pickles, Ritz A breakfast is about 250, give me two boxes, it's really too fast! (Maybe I have stayed in too few high-end hotels. I thought I paid 3,000+ for a suite. I don’t have to worry about it for 2 breakfasts. The layout is slightly smaller.) There is no executive corridor for breakfast when staying in a suite. I really don’t recommend Beijing Financial Street. Thinking, Nanjing Ritz is really excellent and has connotation.

After we ordered the meal, she was going to pick up the meal. She actually said: You take a little less, because you really order too much too much! It looks like a turtle...  
Uh...the three of us ordered three main meals and three eggs. Is there anything wrong with that! And if you can't order so many, why not limit the number? Since it is called self-service, it is also a charge of 280 per person. Why do you talk to the guests like this?
If you feel that you order too much, why not remind you when you order: You can order this much first, we will serve it quickly and eat it hot. You can call me at any time?
Wouldn't there be no training in such words and services in a five-star hotel?
Well, I'm in a good mood, I don't want to eat it instantly
I don't understand that the domestic hotel waiters will always hate and judge the guests, so I wish you a happy meal.

第一次還好衹是態度不好
昨天去是臨時，沒有提前預訂，前台説沒房了，衹有行政套房價格3500，我問有別的辦法嗎，不需要套房
她眼睛都不抬，沒有，3500
我説我可以等中午其他人退房
答：3500，開嗎
都不帶回答你問題的，全程就這麼幾句話
那開吧，她那邊開房，我這邊打開攜程，顯示每個房間都有，房間很富裕，我付款給她看
她生氣的表示，是同時沒有關閉攜程，實際還是沒有房間不能給，我還沒説話，她立馬又表示可以給我我攜程拍的房間，中途不耐煩有摔手機行為，真的政府辦事部門現在都很難看見這種態度了
她給我按攜程預訂辦好了，給我房卡，説可以了
我問，那我剛才刷的4500呢不退給我嗎（3500➕1000按金）
她説那個退還得多掃一次，麻煩，直接當按金
我真的覺得很神奇，很無語，就算你要把之前的房費當按金，難道不應該跟我説一聲嗎
全程趕人且態度差

！！！
我打了前台經理電話反饋，前台經理意思是真的是沒房，同事忘了關閉網絡預訂平台，説了些不痛不癢的話，意思是她能把預訂到的房間給我，我應該感謝

從昨天入住一直到昨天很晚，我都一直看攜程平台，發現全天預訂平台都沒有關閉，一直在接受預訂，如果真的像他們説的，10點我去的時候已經超出預訂，欠了七間房，沒有房間了，那我對這事表示懷疑，為什麼已經沒房了，攜程平台全天不關閉

我有理由懷疑前台是為完成訂房任務，要求我開行政套房，她如果態度好點也許我不會查攜程，她態度真的太差！！無法容忍！

以麗思的標準來衡量的話，好幾項都不合格：浴缸龍頭如圖所示，五星級酒店罕見這種銹漬！淋浴房漏水，容易導致客人滑倒受傷，僅僅放一個提示牌是不夠的，可以改進的空間很大，設施老化不是藉口，工作有態度問題！早餐是我吃過最差的了，三星級標準，同樣別藉口説疫情、過年之類的，我剛從麗晶搬過來，好壞對比度非常強烈！可以去參觀學習一下“單點早餐”在麗晶是怎麼做的，每一份單點早餐都有擺盤，準西餐廳標準，你們的做法是隨便裝一盤吃的就行了……
多了也不想説了，有一種買到假貨的感覺，這家真是麗思卡爾頓嗎？反正我是不會再住了！
各種5星級酒店我經常住，很少寫點評。衹針對特別好和特別差的，這家屬於特別差的，尤其對標麗思這個品牌。希望給對品質有要求的朋友提個醒，我是踩雷了……

小學的時候看過諾丁山，茱莉亞羅伯茨去倫敦住的就是麗茲，就有了情節，等自己長大也要住這個酒店。雖然麗茲酒店在巴黎在倫敦，但是麗思卡爾頓前身就是麗茲，1911年Albert Keller買下Ritz-Carlton在美國的使用權，開始了麗思卡爾頓的歷史，我敢説你們部分員工都不如我瞭解你們酒店的歷史。長大以後，跟着爸媽住過成都，天津，上海的酒店都很喜歡，沒想到北京的竟然水準如此之差。
其實我一直住在北京，根本不怎麼會去住，是朋友要去金購給媽媽買一些新年禮物，真好我也沒事，我請她和寶寶住，強烈吹捧了麗思，因為成都和天津太好了她還説你收錢了吧，你是麗思卡爾頓的水軍吧，看來是打臉了。
大堂除了收費處，竟然辦入住沒有沙發等待，衹有兩個椅子，進入大廳，門口的幾個工作人員除了讓掃碼沒一個人主動説幫拿東西，威斯汀和喜來登起碼都會問一句吧，進入房間之後，衞生間反味，就不説了。
晚上，有一個小需求，給住房部工作人員打電話，她説幫我找，如果沒有會給我打電話，我等了十分鐘沒打，是我主動打過去的，也沒有發脾氣，我問怎麼回事，她説同事再忙，再告訴同事一聲，然後我還沒回復完，她給我掛了，成功激怒了我,如果你主動説忘了沒做，人手不足，希望理解什麼的也可以。竟然這麼冷冰冰的態度掛客人電話，太過分了，我當時心裏想我必須給總部發郵件我打了第三個電話説我要給總部發郵件。
沒想到神奇的事情發生了，事情不到一分鐘解決了，剛才我還是等了半個小時……
暖氣也不行，屋裡很冷，朋友寶寶半夜一直打噴嚏，也是…
後來值班經理態度很好，有一些工作人員一直再補救，他們是很有誠意的，我可能為了他們不會寫了，當然昨天半夜我都寫好維權郵件，算了。
酒店部分員工態度都不如如家亞朵。
其實我酒店我很少長評，悦榕莊和柏悦都超級好，我也懶得寫，很差的也是。
但是這個我肯定會寫，我真的喜歡麗思，我必須捍衞我喜歡的品牌,,捍衞小時候看電影的那個我。

The accommodation fee is more than 2000 per night, why not directly configure the toiletries in the room? This experience has a maximum of 500.
