msg:Hotel front desk a thumbs up as she let us just check in early as flight arrived early ie before 12 pm likely bcoz room available at that time. Unlike other hotel very restrictive even there are rooms avail to check in.
Another thumbs up is the housekeeping lady Deng Mei Gui gave a good service on top of checking with us if we need anything. Just a stone throw away the Metro entrance.
TV should have some english channel for foreigner like myself rather than offering only local programme.
There is a nice barbecue duck, goose, pork and chasiew fastfood stall outside the hotel and just next to entrance into the Metro recommended to have a quick lunch/dineer.
Good view facing the seafront overlooking HK land.

Since we had stayed in this hotel many times before when i used to be an Accor gold member, my wife has requested for another room on upper floors. Room was a lot better.

Anyhow, the dinning place serving the breakfast was poor and with a much disappointing serve of buffet nothing like in the past. 

My wife's comment is she will never wish to stay in the da,r hotel.

The hotel and rooms are needing an update, even the lights in the room, there isnt a master switch. There was a strong smell of cigarette from next door, and a bit noisy. Thr bathroom is old and outdated, a bit dark. Once taking a shower the water ran cold and didnt heat up again. It was clean enough and the staff spoke great English. It isnt a bad hotel, just needs an upgrade.

Almost all hotel staff provide professional service to guests, always ready to help and answer all questions. The a**osphere at the hotel creates an a**osphere of calm and comfort, which is especially pleasant after a busy day at work. There are breakfasts. The room has both a bath and a shower, which is very convenient. For me, having access to a gym was a key choice as I don't like to deviate from my travel habits when I travel. Unfortunately, when I asked the hotel employee about the availability of a gym, he told me that it was not working, I booked at another hotel, but then I called again, and, oh, miracle! I came across another employee who said that the gym was open. I moved here for 2 days, although I planned for a longer period. It's a pity that the employee gave me incorrect information. I will definitely come back next time and recommend this hotel to all my colleagues and friends.

I hired a technician to repair it, but it broke again one night later. I had to stay an extra night because of something else, so I booked a chair on the 16th floor, but the chair was broken again. ￼In addition to these two things, transportation and food are also convenient.

The place is great, everything is close and very convenient
There are many hotel facilities
There are also many types of food for breakfast. Even if you eat out, you can find something delicious if you walk a few steps.
Even if I live near the 18th floor (I don’t know where) someone turns on the stereo so loudly, I can still hear it (my windows are closed). Of course, this is not the fault of the hotel.
The focus is on the location of the hotel's toilets
1. There is a bathtub but the water is not hot enough
2. The water plug in the bathtub was broken and he didn’t even fix it himself.
3. There is a problem with the drainage of the entire toilet.
Anyway, for me this is the most important thing

That night we went to the Shenzhen Civic Center to watch the light show. It was convenient to take the subway and get out of the station without swiping a card. The return trip only cost 2 yuan when leaving the station.
The hotel's buffet dinner is very cost-effective. The hotel buffet lunch is 138 yuan and the dinner is 188 yuan at a preferential price. There are all kinds of products produced by international brand hotels. As soon as you enter the Palm Western Restaurant, you can drink red and white wine, wine and cocktails, more than ten types. Desserts and seafood include sweet shrimps, mussels, emerald snails, sashimi salmon, sea bream, Spanish dace, etc. There are more than eight types of ice cream to choose from. There is also a ramen chef Yang at the hot food stall who is very enthusiastic. He pulled us a Shaanxi-style noodle that was very delicious. Western dishes are more traditional, including chicken and steak, and pan-fried salmon bones are my favorite. There are traditional Chinese soups and Western soups, both of which taste freshly baked. Salads and Chinese dishes at other stalls need to be improved. Judy, the person in charge of the Western restaurant, Zora's service is very nice.
Yuexiuxuan Chinese Restaurant is located on the third floor of the hotel. It serves traditional Cantonese cuisine. On that day, we ordered coconut 🥥 stewed chicken soup, secret mandarin fish, and secret barbecued pork cakes. The dishes are exquisite and delicious. 😋
We will come again next time to experience the dining and hotel experience.

The scenery is very good, the overall feeling is good, the room is clean, the bed is big, but the facilities feel old, and the pillow is too soft and has no elasticity, making it difficult to sleep. There is a charge for TV programs, so you can’t watch them, which can be a bit boring if you have children. The swimming pool is very old, very small, and very deep. Children cannot play in it. If you don't bring a swimsuit and a swimming cap, you have to pay a high price to enter. The swimming cap costs 45 each. The most important thing is that we chose this hotel because it has a sauna, but they told us that it was broken and would not be opened. We were very disappointed. However, the front desk was very nice and extended our check-out until the afternoon, so we forgot about it. Overall, I'm quite satisfied with the price, but please make sure the facilities are running properly next time.

However, there was already a family in the room and they said they had just checked in. I immediately returned to the service desk to inquire. The waiter checked and found that the room was indeed assigned to the wrong room, and quickly allocated another room to me. I did not complain. After getting the room, I went out for dinner. During the period, I found that the hotel called me twice. I did not answer the call at that time. Later, they They sent me a message to say sorry and would send me a fruit plate as an apology. It can be seen that their work and service attitude are very serious, and they are willing to accept mistakes and take responsibility. In fact, I have no pursuit of the problem, but they are also willing to use this As compensation, I really feel that the service in their hotel is very, very good.

The Chinese restaurant's soups, fish, and desserts are five-star, and the vegetables are also delicious. The roasted pork may be a little cold if left out for a long time. The environment and service of the western restaurant are five-star, and there is also a play area for children. Maybe it's because the buffet has too many categories and I didn't try them all. The sashimi and seafood are okay and fresh. There are many types of afternoon tea, which children like to eat. The coffee is good and should be drunk hot. The newly opened tea room is very nice, very suitable for business negotiations. Friends can play mahjong, cards and enjoy tea. The environment is also very good. The service in the front office and guest room is professional and warm. If a child dropped his pants in the guest room, he would call and have it delivered to his home as soon as possible. grateful!

The room as a whole has a sense of age, but it is kept very clean: the back of the TV, cabinet handles, bathtub, shower curtain, and some corners and corners can be seen to have been maintained, which is a surprising place.
The experience is good, except for the poor sound insulation, I have already recommended it to friends, and it can be included in the travel accommodation options.

msg:The hotel's environment is actually pretty good. Although it was a five-star hotel many years ago, it basically has everything you need. The location is very convenient. There is a subway station just outside the door of the hotel. If you want to go to the Civic Center or Window of the World, it is only three subway stops away. However, the soundproofing of the hotel is so bad that the waiter was talking to other rooms at the door. It's like talking to me. So I needed to wear earplugs throughout my stay. Hopefully this can be optimized.

I bought other daily necessities, and the sincere service is very good, but the hotel facilities are relatively old, and the bathtub faucet is not flexible. I was pinched with my finger, and it hurt a little. Be careful! As for the faucet where you brush your teeth and freshen up, no matter how you turn it on, there is only warm water. It is very inconvenient to wash your face. The picture quality of the TV is not very clear. The hotel is near the subway station, but it is very deserted. Go to the safe box outside the hotel gate to pick it up, but the air conditioner is cold enough, the room is also very clean, there are many places for plugs and forks, and thank you for the birthday cake and fruit sent by the hotel!

msg:Transportation: Very convenient, opposite to the hotel is Zhuzilin Station of Metro Line 1 (Exit B2). It takes only 5 minutes to get there, but there is a long corridor in the subway.

Room environment: For this three-person trip, we will book the left deluxe twin room (for 4 people). There are two 1.8-meter-large beds in the room, and there is also a beautiful city view, and you can also see some sea views. The rooms are very clean.
But because the hotel has been in operation for many years, the sofa is a little old, the picture quality of the TV is low, and the remote control is more difficult. There are 2 USB chargers in the room, and more than three plugs. You can choose between bathtub and bathtub in the bathroom. The bathtub is a little dirty, but there are only two sets of towels, slippers and toothbrushes in the four-person room, so you need to call the front desk and ask for more sets.
In terms of Wi-Fi, it is not used at all. Although it shows that it is connected on the left and the signal is good, it is completely loaded and cannot be accessed anywhere.

Hotel facilities: I went to the left indoor swimming pool today. There are relatively few people swimming in the pool, and the pool area is quite large, so it is very comfortable to swim. However, the top of the interior is quite dirty, with a lot of rust, and the appearance is not very good. The Continental Hotel requires guests to wear a swimming cap before they can enter the swimming pool, otherwise they have to buy it in the hotel. Overall, the price/performance ratio is high, and everyone in the house is very satisfied.

When the time came, I came again and had to wait in line for a long time. When I got to the line, I was told that there was no room and I had to wait again. Duo Naicai has rooms available.
In addition, I paid the deposit with a credit card, and when I left, the clerk said that the deposit ($500) would be refunded to my credit card. As of March 11, I have not received the deposit back. Because I didn't know that the hotel had not refunded the deposit, the bank had to charge a fine of RMB 230.

The hotel has free parking, and the service is also very good. Xiao Pan at the front desk is very nice. Seeing that I booked a room without breakfast, I immediately applied for a free breakfast. I said I wanted a quieter room, so I helped transfer it to a high-rise room where you can see the sea Room type, very thoughtful. We drank the coffee and water in the guest room, and made up for us in time when we went out to play. We also thoughtfully rearranged the bed, put the disposable slippers in order, and left a small note, which is very helpful Attentive, thank you waiter Shen Kaiyun. I didn't come down for breakfast until 9:30 in the morning, and there were so many choices. The overall feeling is great 👍

Originally, at the price of a hotel in Shenzhen, I didn’t expect too much, but once I entered the hotel, I felt very grand, and the hotel service was also very considerate (like Haiyan at the front desk). Seeing me staying with my child, I helped upgrade the standard room to a luxurious 1.8-meter room for free Twin room, and did not order breakfast due to personal reasons, but also free buffet breakfast for 2 people, very heartwarming! The room is large and very beautiful, and you can enjoy the sea view of Shenzhen Bay. I am really satisfied! The transportation is very convenient, just cross the road on the right hand side when you come out of Exit B2 of Zhuzilin Subway Station! If it's not that there is something to do in the future and you are not nearby, I really want to continue to stay, come again next time! The fly in the oin**ent is: it would be better if there is a self-service tea in the lobby on the first floor; the wall panels and floor tiles in the entrance and bathroom are a bit old, and it would be better to renovate; if there is a parent-child room, children will prefer to come! The overall is quite good, a very satisfactory hotel!

If you put it in the current hotel experience, it is very old, and the sound insulation is very poor. If you close the door to the other side, I can hear it when I sleep until midnight.

The room type I stayed in was a bit like an apar**ent as it would have a kitchen like area which wasn't particularly nice and then the room type I was allocated was blocked by the building.

The room type I stayed in is not particularly high-end, and the refrigerator has a particularly harsh electrical sound (let room service deal with it later)

The good thing is that the room service is very nice. I said I needed mineral water, and he brought me six bottles at once, which was pleasantly surprised.

The service of the hotel is okay, the aunts in the room and the concierge at the door are very warm.
The main reason is that the hotel is relatively old, and you can smell the mildewy smell of the old house as soon as you enter the room.
The second thing is that the room is too small and the bed is too small. It is really rare to see a bed as small as a star hotel, and it feels no different from a budget hotel.

This kind of upgrade, what do you mean, the original 15th floor can see a large urban village on the 18th floor, it is not recommended to choose this hotel for business trips to Shenzhen, there is no advantage at all, the pricing is not proportional to the service and facilities, all consumables It's no different from ordinary express hotels.

msg:During the summer vacation with children, I upgraded the 1099 parent-child package with the recommendation of the young lady at the front desk. The theme layout also includes a buffet dinner for two large and one small, which is great! The layout of the room is very meticulous and pleasantly surprised. The children like it very much. The room is spacious and the decoration style of the facilities is very fashionable. The overall service of the hotel is good and the traffic is convenient.

msg:After staying for three days, the hotel’s facilities are old and I have no choice but to write a bad review. As you can see, the plaster fell from the ceiling when I woke up and hit the clothes (the clothes were taken away when the photo was taken). I called the front desk of the hotel and asked someone to check it. , But only the cleaning staff came to clean up, and I asked to change the room. Isn’t this the obligation of your hotel? Ok, I don’t want to make trouble, so I accept the room change. As a result (the last four pictures), the room is changed, this room The ceiling plaster in the toilet area fell off again at night. How lucky I am to have this situation in both rooms, which is really annoying, but this time because I have to check out the next day, I didn’t talk to the hotel. There is a problem with the room, anyway, the hotel will not have a good attitude, but please understand that I came to the hotel on a business trip, hoping to have a good rest, not specifically to find trouble to cooperate with you to solve the problem, such a situation occurs , I didn’t make any compensation for interrupting my rest time because my temper was too lazy to care about, but who would feel comfortable with this kind of check-in experience?

When I called, I found white bugs that could jump on the phone. It made me spend the whole night. Fear, afraid of jumping. So I didn't sleep well all night............ The third remote control is also a lot of dust. Furthermore, the welcome pastry is laid out naked, so how can customers eat it? It feels covered with dust... Finally, it is the toothbrush, which is too inferior, hard, and bloody... I should not go back again. This five-star, very disappointed...

窗外環境優美，開陽，可以望海。住宿環境很好櫃檯願意提升房間等級，服務態度一流！
但是隔音一般。房間衛生程度不差，可以有改善空間！裝修比較舊，房間顏色比較暗沉！
但值得推薦入住，性價比高！

不過酒店周邊吃飯的選擇不是很多，酒店泳池不大，喜歡游泳的朋友衹能涮涮而已。

🧹衞生：符合星級水平
