msg:A five-star hotel that opened not long ago and is based on health care. The room layout, plumbing and lighting are better than other hotels, and are full of home-like feeling - comfortable and warm. The restaurant food is well-made, the price is not much different from that of farmhouses outside, and the ingredients are fresh. There are also relatively complete calligraphy and painting rooms, libraries, table tennis, KTV and movie theaters.

msg:I accidentally came across this hotel and decided to give it a try. The experience was beyond my expectations! It was newly opened in October 2023. The hotel staff are very nice. This time I brought my dog ​​with me and booked a room that pets can stay in. It was clean and odor-free. There are elderly people at home, and the hotel is equipped with wheelchairs and scooters. It is really thoughtful. There is also a small golf course. The restaurant manager is also very considerate. He asked about our taste and prepared meals for us! I will recommend friends to go again.⭐️

msg:Treasure Hotel (except breakfast), the staff are very enthusiastic, the location is not good to comment, suitable for self-driving tours, the surrounding environment is very quiet ~

The hotel has various entertainment rooms suitable for children to play, constant temperature swimming pools, gyms, etc. ~ There is also a mini golf course around the lake ~ Fireworks suddenly set off at night, and the May Day holiday had a New Year feeling ~

The guest rooms are also good, the parent-child loft is a room with two large beds, but it is too new and there will be a decoration smell that is difficult to dissipate,,,

Breakfast is hard to describe, the parent-child hotel only gives two breakfast coupons, and babies over 1.3 meters have to pay separately at the restaurant entrance. Then! The category is really emmm~ The taste is even more emmmm…………

Apart from breakfast, the other experiences are very good. Compared with Hyatt, children like this place more~ I will give priority to this place when I come to Chongming next time

msg:I ran a marathon on April 13th. I originally booked another hotel, but in order to let my parents have some activities and recuperation, I changed to Xinlan. I think Xinlan Yunju deserves a higher rating!
The hotel helped to upgrade to a suite, the environment is amazing, very good! A car was also arranged for pick-up on the day of the marathon. The key is that the supporting facilities on the first floor are all available, including a gym, swimming pool, table tennis snooker, and a cinema😂The hotel itself is used for health care, which is really good. After running, I was too lazy to go out and lay down directly in the hotel... In addition, the breakfast is not bad, and I paid an extra breakfast of 88 yuan. Although the variety is a little less and does not match the price, the Cantonese breakfast is not made of the kind of fooling ingredients, and the quality is quite good. I also had a dinner, which was a little salty, but I lost a lot of salt after running that day, so I think it's pretty good.

msg:A very bad experience! This is my first negative review on Ctrip!
First: A ring worth about 2,000 yuan was placed under the TV. I forgot to take it when I checked out and asked the store. They then gave me no feedback. We used the character guarantee to be sure that the ring was placed there. Consider yourself unlucky. Cleaning We don't have any evidence.
Second: There was a smell in the hotel corridor and the room. My wife and I analyzed that it smelled like a zoo, but we didn’t see any animals during our stay. I almost had the urge to sleep in the car most of the night!
Third: The balcony door cannot be locked and the balconies of the rooms on the second floor are connected to each other, which poses a serious safety hazard. When I asked the front desk, the original answer I received was: "It should be no problem."
Fourth: The garage sign indicates that the elevator cannot directly enter the hotel corridor. It has to go through a door and the waiter must swipe the card to open it. When I went upstairs, a waitress yelled and said, don’t go from here in the future. If you don’t let me go from here, then you What's the purpose of the parking sign?
Fifth: I saw with my own eyes that the housekeeper kept the door open for a party in the room at night to eat snacks. The sound was very loud and affected the rest. I also had breakfast with the staff the next day, and it was really noisy!
All in all, it was a very poor experience! It feels like the good reviews are all earned!

There are many entertainment facilities in the hotel, some require payment and some are free. The swimming pool was not used for maintenance on the day I went. The room was new and very clean, but the air conditioning was a bit too strong. It was a bit too hot to sleep at night. I don’t know if the breakfast was because there were few people or because it was originally It comes with a set. I originally thought it was a buffet but ended up getting one set per person, but it tastes great and the sandwich is very delicious! The hotel service is very good.

Although I did not know his position from beginning to end, he provided butler-style service throughout the stay, and was responsive to all requests. He took the initiative to pick me up and guide me to check in when I could not find the way by car. Because I have two children, he also helped me upgrade the two-bedroom and one-living room. It was really thoughtful. The room hardware facilities are also very good, with a refrigerator, washing machine, coffee machine, and floor heating throughout the house (it was so hot that I sweated), and the quilt and pillow are also very comfortable. The hotel has complete facilities, a cinema, a constant temperature swimming pool, a billiard room, and a handicraft room. Adults and children are very happy. I hope to go again, and I also hope that Mr. Huang will be responsible for the reception. It was a very satisfactory experience!

msg:Overall, I am very satisfied. The parent-child loft room type is very popular with children. In addition to the stairs, there are tents and wooden horses, and two large beds, which are very suitable for bringing children.
First of all, I would like to make a small suggestion. Since it is a parent-child room type, it is not equipped with a footstool for children. I asked the hotel and it didn't have one. After all, the bathroom basin is based on the height of an adult. It is basically difficult for preschool children to wash their hands, brush their teeth and wash their faces. I hope the hotel can add a small footstool in the room.

Facilities: The hotel was newly opened in 2023. The hardware is very new and the supplies are pretty good. But you can still smell the smell of wooden furniture when you enter the room. The room is very spacious and the room type you booked has a balcony. Daikin's central air conditioning, the upstairs and downstairs are still separated by the air conditioning central control. What is more surprising is that all drinks, water, and snacks in the mini bar are free of charge, without additional charges. It is very refreshing to put 5 bottles of mineral water (basically, the hotels I have stayed in are all 2 bottles) and potato chips, peanut juice, and Paris water. In addition, there is a capsule coffee machine + two capsules.

Environment: The area where the hotel is located is a high-end retirement community, the environment is very good, relatively quiet and spacious. This time I stayed at Huiting. The other Yunju has more complete facilities, and it has a complex of health and elderly care functions. Billiards, golf, library, cycling, table tennis and swimming pool are all open to guests staying in the hotel.

Catering: They are all in Yunju. If you stay in Huiting, it is actually very close to walk. The hotel also has a shuttle bus. The buffet breakfast is quite rich. Since there are not many guests staying in the hotel at the end of the Spring Festival holiday, dinner is relatively simple. It is a good value for money to have a buffet meal.

Hygiene: It is quite clean and it is a new store. Disposable toiletries are complete, including children's. The toiletries are all grapefruit scented, which I like very much. Unfortunately, there are no gifts such as samples.

Service: The staff are very nice

msg:A newly opened hotel in Chenjia Town. It is very close to Dongtan. There is a Niupeng Town nearby. There are supermarkets, markets and barbecues. It is very convenient.
       The hotel was very considerate and called in advance to ask about what time we would check in. He informed me of the direction in case I went in the wrong direction. The butler, Xiao Chang, was really good at greeting us at the door in advance. He was so considerate and made us feel like we were at home. He checked in and took us all the way. The entertainment items and details of the hotel were introduced on the way to the room.
       The room has floor heating and coffee machine. The floor heating and air conditioning are already turned on as soon as you enter. The details are all in place and the experience is great. The water in the swimming pool is very comfortable and not cold. It is clean. The breakfast is a set meal. It is quite sufficient for one person. Normally, two breakfasts for a family of three are enough for us. The three of us were very satisfied with the meal. The hotel mainly specializes in Cantonese cuisine. I personally think the chef is great and the taste is very good.
       The hotel is very big. It is very comfortable to walk around in the morning. The birds chirp very nicely. It is very quiet. My baby likes it very much. I personally think it is a very good hotel in Chongming. The appearance and details of the facilities are great. The hotel is very stylish and of high quality. I feel that the boss is very attentive.
       Thank you Xiaotong for your attentive service. It’s great. I will introduce friends to play together.

msg:A hotel that must be rated five stars. We traveled with our family and booked Huiting Yunju. When we arrived at the lobby, a man in a gray suit and glasses took the initiative to upgrade us to the Yunju Hotel (main building) suite, which saved us the trouble of taking a shuttle bus to the main building in cold weather. Thank you very much🙏. The breakfast was also very delicious. The chef should be from Guangdong. He was very polite and well-managed. For breakfast, you can eat Cantonese snacks such as shrimp dumplings, chicken feet, spare ribs, and barbecued pork buns. It is really not inferior to the old teahouses I had in Guangdong before, and there are freshly fried dough sticks. In short, everything is 👍. Most of the other five-star hotels have a lot of varieties, and the taste is really hard to describe. I haven't had such a comfortable breakfast for a long time~ In addition, the hotel's facilities are also complete. Billiards, table tennis, calligraphy and painting, handicrafts, and movies are all free. Only chess, cards, golf, and KTV are charged. You will never be bored if you don't leave the hotel. If the weather is warm, the outdoor area of ​​the hotel is also suitable for taking pictures.

msg:This time, I chose to spend the Chinese New Year in Chongming again. I booked the Xinlan Tiandi Hotel. Let me first talk about the good things about the hotel. The hotel is newly built, the facilities are relatively new, the room type is good, suitable for a family of three, the children can have their own bed, the hotel's sanitary products are given directly, no need to ask the front desk, extra drinks and snacks are delivered every day, if not enough, the cleaning aunt will give more. Let's talk about the shortcomings. Check-in was on the eve of the Chinese New Year. When I drove to arrive, the front desk told me that the hotel is divided into two parts. This is Yunju, and we booked Hunting Yunju. Although it is not far away from the side, it is not easy to find in the dark, and breakfast is eaten at Yunju. You need to drive yourself or call a shuttle bus. After checking in, I started to take a shower, and the floor drain was blocked halfway through. . . . This is really the first time I have encountered it. I contacted the front desk. There was only a young man at the front desk that night. The young man's attitude was good. He looked for us for a long time to repair it, but he couldn't find it. He could only change our room, and then the whole family could only pack things and move luggage late at night. . . Finally, I have to mention the breakfast. The breakfast on the second day was a set meal. This was the first time I encountered a five-star hotel with a set breakfast. It was not during the epidemic. The room price was more than 1,000 yuan a night, but I was asked to eat a set meal. I was speechless. I must check the breakfast format when booking a hotel in the future! The location of the hotel is relatively remote, but the environment is still good. There is a golf course and a big lake!

優點:
酒店環境好，康養型度假社區。也適合親子。休閑娛樂設施齊全。

房間都比較新。電吹風也是戴森。吧枱小食免費。
工作人員態度很好。

缺點:
新酒店，所以打開房門裝修味還是很濃。健身房也有股濃烈的橡膠味。

酒店內部環境不錯，但是周圍無商業。

餐飲部分，早餐尚可，但是晚上的中餐廳水準實在比不上崇明的農家樂。估計由於平時來客量比較少，菜單也比較簡單，上菜也比較慢。我們桌有兩個菜能把人鹹死！和服務員反映了，也衹是説去反應，但是沒有後續。最普通的番茄蛋湯也能酸**。一桌菜下來，基本沒一個好吃的。可見大廚水平實在不敢恭維，建議大家去吃農家樂。

酒店內部自行車租賃價格太高。

1、項目整體環境好，配套完善：書畫室、影院、茶室、圖書館、健身房、游泳池、手工坊、廚藝坊等等，假日還安排各種活動，不出酒店就能享受豐富的活動
2、服務態度好：從駁車小哥、餐廳服務人員、前台等等，都親切主動，讓人感覺很舒心
3、房間的minibar提供了豐富的飲品和零食，且全部免費
4、早餐不錯：蒸鳳爪等廣式點心是亮點，一般五星酒店都沒有這些選項
缺點：1、房間的設施和衞生情況都一般：屢次發現煙頭，打掃比較馬虎，設施選材沒有高級感，總給人打掃不乾淨的感覺
2、中餐午晚餐衹提供套餐，基本沒有選擇

扣一星給早餐，很普通，自助餐品種類也不多，但附近也沒有其他可以吃的了。

msg:為了看流星雨臨時在崇明住宿一晚，預訂前致電詢問周邊情況怕有光污染，前台耐心解答，到店後，前台謝妹妹人美心善，給升級了有陽台的兩室一廳的房間，設施很新，乾淨寬敞，房間有免費小零食，有微波爐，晚上在陽台上看見流星，覺得不虛此行，如果以後想看流星雨感覺可能住二樓有露台的房間視野可能更開闊。半夜打車去東灘，前台小哥哥細心地護送我們到門口，酒店美中不足的是用餐需要提前預約，一開始不知道，而且周邊也沒啥餐飲，外賣也衹有兩家餐廳可以送餐，要一小時才能送到，起送金額也不低，這點不太方便，衹能買酒店泡麪，15元一桶對付一下，希望以後可以改進，酒店配套有乒乓球室等可以免費使用，離店時前台還贈送了伴手禮，很貼心。
