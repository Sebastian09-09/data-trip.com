 surrounding forest and mountains. The autumn colors were amazing.
We got very well attended. Special thanks to 徐小棠 Tina Xu who attended us at the Swissôtel Italian restaurant on the first night and then at both breakfasts.

Hanging Five Diamonds has complete facilities and the staff are attentive and enthusiastic. Parking spaces are plentiful. Breakfast was mediocre. If you are lucky, you can see the sunrise from the room. The environment is very good and the air is fresh. Small hotel, very quiet, recommended.

The Chinese food at Man Restaurant tastes very good. In-house guests can get a 20% discount. The variety of breakfast dishes is not large, but it basically has what you need. I stayed for four nights and the breakfast varieties changed every day. The juices are all freshly squeezed. . The cocktails at Moonlight Bar on the 5th floor are also good~

Service: I have to praise the service! The service provided by the ladies and brothers at the front desk and restaurant is so good. If the children like Changbai Mountain Cultural and Creative Ice Cream, they will give it to them for free! I also received ginseng slices and dried blueberries as souvenirs upon check-out. The mini bar is also free, with beer and chocolate, and the birch juice is delicious!

Facilities: There is a shuttle bus in the park, MGallery has additional business shuttle buses, and airport shuttles are also free. Luneng's ski resort is really suitable for novices. There are few people and the slopes are gentle. After 2 hours of one-on-one instruction from the instructor, you can push the slope with the back edge. Next year, you can learn to change the edge and ride on the ski resort! By the way, the snow slide is super fun!

Environment: It’s true that the snow scenery in the hotel is beautiful. You can see Changbai Mountain from the mountain view room. The water temperature in the Internet celebrity bathing pool is very warm. It feels good to soak in the hot spring in the snow (but this hot spring is not natural)

Facilities: The bath water is relatively small, and the hottest setting is not very hot; the toilet does not have electric heating, which is quite old for a hotel of this level, and there was some odor in the toilet when I checked in. I had to wake up the next day. The room was a bit smelly. I really recommend that the hotel upgrade the toilet so that guests can have a better stay experience.

The breakfast options are quite rich, and many snacks and staple foods are sugar-free, which is very satisfying.

Meijing Pavilion is small, but the check-in experience is still online. From the time I booked the New Year's Eve dinner before departure, Mengmeng has been taking the trouble to help me. The young girls and boys I met during the stay were all smiling, which made us feel welcome in a foreign land. Had a very happy New Year. I saw the clear Changbai Mountain on the day I checked in, and I also saw the rising sun the next morning. I was very lucky. Ginger tea is always served in the lobby, so you can have a warm cup when you come back from outside. The child was very satisfied with this trip and asked to come to Meijing Pavilion to celebrate the New Year next year. I think this should be the best evaluation.

The hotel has beautiful snow scenery and an infinity pool. On a clear day, you can enjoy the distant view of Changbai Mountain.
The service of the hotel is also very good. When we checked in, we were warmly received by the hotel staff Xu Boxiang, Gu Yunfei, Gao Yang, and Cecilia, and they introduced us in detail to the various recreational facilities in the resort and the benefits included in the room.
During the subsequent stay, whenever I have any needs, I will respond very quickly. Thank you very much.
I have seen many comments saying that the hotel's breakfast has few varieties. I think it is small but exquisite. It has drinks, coffee, porridge, salad station, cheese station, noodle stall, freshly made snacks (different every day, including toast and pancakes), steamed Order, fried food, stir-fries, fried rice, bread, yogurt, etc. are all available.
Since there are few rooms in the hotel, it is really quiet. Even during the Chinese New Year, the breakfast room is very empty and not crowded. I really like this. I guess it is quite crowded in Switzerland.
I also had a dinner at the hotel, and hotel guests got a 20% discount. It was good. The waiters in the restaurant were humble and courteous, and the service was very good.
ps: I don’t think the soundproofing is bad. It seems that the hair dryer in the bathroom has been replaced by Leifen because of complaints from previous residents. It’s good that it dries hair quickly~

Because the reservation was for a suite, which involved the number of guests and airport pick-up rights, etc., I contacted the hotel in advance through Ctrip’s official merchant contact method. After informing me of my needs, the person on the phone responded and asked the housekeeper to add me on WeChat later. Contact me to arrange specific arrangements. Then it was normal to add WeChat to communicate specific matters, and also asked him about entertainment and dining around the hotel, and he also gave specific replies. It wasn't until I went to the hotel to check in and the front desk asked to add WeChat to provide butler services. I said someone had already added it before, that I discovered that this person was not an employee of the hotel at all. I don’t know how, after I contacted the official phone number, he was able to get my WeChat ID to add it. It’s scary to think about it. I hope both the hotel and Ctrip will pay attention to this matter! The following is the fake housekeeper’s WeChat ID and some chat records.

Enter from the gate of the scenic area, first go to Yuanxiang Lake Folk Custom Hotel, then go up a slope and cross a small road to Meijing Pavilion. There is a shuttle bus in the scenic area, which is only one stop away from the ski hall and the town commercial street. The shuttle bus takes less than 5 minutes to arrive, which is very convenient. The point is that it is relatively private and quiet, and there are not many people, which is suitable for people who like quietness. The hotel lobby is not big, and there are only 2 people at the front desk. When checking in, the additional content of the package is explained in detail, and it is also generous. It will be personalized according to different guests. Give it a thumbs up. There is a large snow field behind the hotel. The southern little potato is very happy to see this big snow field. The room area is quite large, the bathroom is separated into dry and wet areas and has a bathtub. You can see Changbai Mountain in every room. The scenery is invincible. You can see the sunrise by opening the curtains in the morning. It's great. Da
The best thing is the hotel's outdoor hot spring bath. Although it is small with only two pools, the view is invincible. It is facing Changbai Mountain. You can enjoy Changbai Mountain while bathing and watch children playing in the snow. It is perfect. However, I have a suggestion. The hotel has no indoor passage to the hot spring. There must be an outdoor passage. It is very cold. The locker room of the hot spring depar**ent is not well managed. The locker box is damaged. The underwear changed by the previous guests is thrown everywhere. The locker room door is not closed. The sign is not obvious enough. Someone broke in halfway ☹️
The breakfast variety is not much, but it is still exquisite. There are surprises every day. There are freshly made Shandong pancakes and egg sandwiches. The stalls will change every day. I give a full score for this. In addition, the drinks are freshly squeezed watermelon juice, perfect and a**ospheric, hahaha
Overall, it is good, convenient transportation, relatively private environment, very good

The cleaning sister also says hello every time she sees her, and delivers what she needs right away, as well as Zhang Yingwen, everyone makes people feel warm and considerate.
The rooms are clean, the lobby is spacious and bright, and the staff are warm and polite. This is my evaluation of this hotel! Excellent!

The location can indeed see Changbai Mountain in the distance, which is in line with the maximum positioning of this hotel.
The service is also good, including breakfast, ski hot springs and snowmobile driving in the resort.
The only drawback is the facilities. The body lotion bottle was empty and the room was not cleaned for two consecutive days.

This time I brought my daughter to experience it during the Chris**as vacation, and it really lived up to my expectations! Compared with the bustle of Switzerland, Meijing Pavilion is more quiet, like a fairyland on earth. The weather is pleasant. Looking from the hotel balcony, Changbai Mountain is covered in silver, like a fairy tale. I tried the hotel's new afternoon tea, which my daughter loved very much, and the dinner was equally delicious. From check-in to check-out, you always feel the warm service of the staff. The lady at the front desk also asked me if I needed specially prepared red date and ginger tea, which made me feel at home. I would like to sincerely thank every staff member of the hotel and look forward to having the opportunity to visit again.

When it was time to check in, the front desk helped to upgrade the room type and thoughtfully reminded that it might be a bit noisy due to celebrity live broadcasts in the lobby. They helped arrange a room farther away.
Going to the hot springs in the evening was well arranged at any time.
Breakfast comes with pan-fried Longli fish and drinks such as coffee or milk will be delivered to the table.
I went to Changbai Mountain on the day of check-out. Since I didn’t have time to pack my luggage, they kept the room for me to check out.
The front desk didn't say anything about charging more. It was really very user-friendly.
On the day of check-in, I said I wanted to play UTV in the snow, and the concierge staff made arrangements immediately.
Special thanks to Guo Yinglan, Liu Chang, Zhang Yingwen, Cui Rongkai
Everyone is very enthusiastic and service-minded
I will definitely stay here again next time
P.S The view from the hotel is simply beautiful!

There is an outdoor hot spring on the first floor where you can enjoy the mountain view while soaking. Since the check-in, there have been staff providing services with impeccable attitude and service level. After staying for many days, I have eaten at the hotel restaurant many times. Thanks to Xu Xiaotang and Xing Yan for taking care of the elderly and children. During the May Day period, the temperature is low, and the room has floor heating. This is very important. It is recommended for all those who go to Changbai Mountain, especially for skiing or sightseeing on the west slope.

msg:The worst value for money hotel in the entire trip. To put it bluntly, the room hardware is considered a five-star standard. But it is very unfavorable: 1. I gave up the choice of many five-star hotels in Wanda Resort, paid more expensive prices, and accepted more inconvenient costs such as meals, just to see a more beautiful scenery from the room. As a result, the balconies of all hotel rooms are covered by brick roofs. This is completely invisible in Ctrip’s promotional photos and videos, and is considered false propaganda. 2. The front desk service was very perfunctory because the room included some free entertainment items. We arrived at 4:30 and were told that the entertainment items would close at 5:00. The entertainment items are not in the hotel, but can be accessed from other locations in the resort (need to drive). When asking about the location of the front desk staff, the front desk staff was very careless and lukewarm. It was near the ski resort. How did our first-time visitors know about snow? Where is the field? I didn't have time to experience all the projects, so I only wanted to experience the off-road vehicle. I specifically asked if the off-road vehicle project was included with all the other projects. The front desk said yes, but we hurried to the venue and found the off-road vehicle. As a result, the staff It was said that the off-road vehicle experience in the hotel was not here at all, but in another place. At that time, it was too late for us to drive there. In the end, we made the trip in vain and experienced nothing. Known as the top hotel in Luneng, the service is not even comparable to the budget hotels in the itinerary. 3. The breakfast is poor, basically on the same level as 7 Days Inn. In short, the experience is completely worth the price. The resort is beautiful, but I will not go to this hotel again.

msg:The second time I stayed, and it was still within the year. The service was a bit sloppy. Overall, it was ok. There were quite a few small problems to be found in the details. There is still a long way to go from the service level of the Accor executive room, such as dead ends in sanitation and replacement of daily necessities, but it is also ok Understand, after all, it’s not the Lantern Festival yet, the manpower is insufficient, the service feedback is slower, and the aunt who does the cleaning in particular looks exhausted, so let’s forget about these small places. The attitude of the staff is still very good, and all problems are arranged and properly resolved. I hope to strengthen the training in details. What needs to be mentioned is that there is a 20% discount for dining in the restaurant when staying in the hotel, but I was not informed until I met the restaurant manager for the last meal. Although the discount is not much, it is not a matter of money. After all, I stayed for 4 nights and felt a little neglected.
The other is the ski resort, the management is chaotic, but this should not be under the management of the hotel. (One day I went skiing. I arrived at 10 o'clock that day. My family borrowed the equipment to go skiing. I just borrowed the shoes and went to the bathroom. Suddenly, I don't know if it was a tour group or something organized. , took up all the space, and the locker room in the lobby was in chaos. There were several hours before and after the long queue, and I couldn’t borrow a board until after 2 pm. Many people in that group can’t skate, just go straight They rushed towards the intermediate and high-level roads, and no one organized them in the ski resort. Later, I heard that some children were washed away. Afraid of being hit by a torpedo, I hurriedly dragged my family away, but the equipment was still in line for another hour, and I went back to the hotel. In the end, I almost missed the shuttle bus, and there were no other cars outside. If I missed it at that time, I had to walk 2 kilometers back... The experience on this day was very bad. I originally stayed for 3 days, but it was because I didn’t slip that day, so I didn’t I extended my stay for a day, but fortunately there was no such situation on the extended day.) What the hotel can do, maybe consider adding a special channel for hotel guests to rent equipment for hotel guests? (Just like there is a dedicated channel for opening a card to pay) If I encounter this kind of situation in the ski resort next time, I may not consider coming to Luneng's hotel again.

msg:Advantages: The hotel is very photogenic, so feel free to take pictures
You can see Changbai Mountain from the balcony, you can take beautiful photos of the snow scene without going out, and the pool is also beautiful
Talk to the front desk when you travel. The hotel will arrange a car pick-up. Don’t worry about it.
The restaurant buffet on the first floor tastes okay
The hotel staff are also very enthusiastic. The waiter Xu Xiaotang and Liu Xinyu in the restaurant are very nice.
It would be even better if the hardware of the hotel can be upgraded. There is really nothing to eat nearby. Luneng is a bit painful for foodies. Also, there is no on-demand TV in a hotel at this price... You must know that it gets dark at four o'clock, which is very boring. T T

msg:I was very disappointed. First of all, I checked into the hotel, but there was no one to receive me. When I entered the hotel, it was decorated in an old-fashioned style. The facilities were very old and the sanitation was very poor. The sofa in the room is dirty everywhere, the shower water temperature is hot and cold, and the design of various handles is unreasonable. When I went out and asked the front desk for a mask, the answer was exhausted, so I went. Aren’t masks standard at the front desk, and I didn’t help to find a solution. Check out early the next day. In theory, it is possible to delay check out. We also consider other guests. Because of the New Year’s Day holiday, they don’t take up much room resources, because they go skiing. When they come back, they ask if there is a place to change clothes and take a shower. The reply says No, as a ski resort-themed hotel, there is no such simple service. What's more, there is only one person on duty at the front desk, and the various responses are very indifferent. This price is really not as good as Home Inns and Hanting

The bubble pool on the first floor is designed with two temperatures. Basically, you can play for an hour every day. Wearing a bathrobe and rushing outside, you can feel the unique "directness" of the Northeast😄
The buffet breakfast in the restaurant is also very rich. Although the price of lunch and dinner is on the high side, every dish, such as pot-packed meat, is very authentic. If you just want to find a place for leisure and vacation, this is a good choice.
Jiang Haipeng, Tong Xinyi, Cheng Fangzhuo, and Liu Zongxin in the lobby at the front desk responded to every request and helped to change rooms, which added a lot of warmth to the trip to Changbai Mountain. Thank you very much!
On New Year's Eve 2022, I also saw the fireworks at Swissotel Luneng, which was very complete 🎆

The hotel is only 10 minutes away from the ski resort by shuttle bus, and there are not many people in the ski resort. Compared with Wanda's commercialization, this place is more original and can get in touch with nature. I will still choose this hotel next time I come to Changbai Mountain.

msg:Overall, I think the MGallery is very cost-effective. During the 11th period, the Wanda Park Hyatt costs more than 2,000, and there is no view. The MGallery not only has a good view, but also only costs more than 1,000 for an executive room.
The most prominent advantage is the scenery. Not only in MGallery, but the entire Luneng Resort is simply amazing, leaving Wanda Eighteen Streets behind. I personally think that when you go out to travel, you must live in a distinctive place. It can be said that Luneng’s side reflects the characteristics of Changbai Mountain incisively and vividly. This view is not found anywhere else, and that is a unique competitive advantage.
In addition, the MGallery service is particularly in place. We ate at the restaurant. Because we had 2 children, the chef gave the children a large fruit plate, and also gave us a dessert plate that was not on the menu, which was very considerate. Although the variety of breakfast is not so rich, but the quality is very good, the waiter is very active and enthusiastic, and will also take the initiative to bring some special dishes, such as steak, durian pizza, these let us try.
In addition, there are more activities that children in Luneng can participate in than expected. Kuilu Park and No. 7 Discovery World have some activities and facilities suitable for children to participate in, suitable for three days and two nights.
The main disadvantage of Luneng is that there are too few choices to eat. If this aspect can be improved, it will be perfect...

When I came to the hotel with my luggage that day, I was really shocked by the scenery in the lobby. With a wide field of vision, Changbai Mountain has a panoramic view. The room has a balcony, and it also faces Changbai Mountain. The scenery is really beautiful!
The room itself is also very big, there are showers in the rain, coffee and capsule coffee can also be used by yourself, which is very considerate.
In addition, I want to mention the staff here, from the front desk to the concierge to the restaurant, the attitude is very nice. The concierge sister anne wang is very enthusiastic. I want to see other rooms or ask about places to play around, and they are very patient reception and correspondence. It's also a little brother at the front desk. I forgot to ask his name... He is super nice der
The young ladies at the restaurant, Xu Xiaotang and Zhang Xinyan, as well as chefs Wang Hao and Xu Jinhuan were also very enthusiastic. I played late for two days and went back to the hotel, but I was still very eager to meet me for dinner. To be honest, I am quite embarrassed 🥲 Lunch is also later than the average tourist going to the restaurant, but the lady and the chef will be very patient with me. , caring ~ Finally, I would like to praise Gu Yunfei and Guan Junxu from the concierge depar**ent. They will take the initiative to ask what help is needed or what they are lacking, and praise the service awareness 👍 The hotel's pond scenery is really invincible! You can watch the stars while soaking at night, and during the day you can directly see the opposite Changbai Mountain, invincible!
Continue to stay in Luneng MGallery when you are ready to ski in winter!

msg:The design of the hotel is flawed. The high eaves of the guest rooms on the next floor block half of the view from the balcony. The view is blocked and the view is very uncomfortable. You can only see far away. When the weather is bad, the view from the distance is Changbai Mountain cannot be seen at all. The most embarrassing high-end view hotel I have ever stayed in.
As a hotel that focuses on viewing, the design does not match the theme. Since it is at the top of the mountain and far away from the ski resort, it is not as convenient as waiting to go to the ski resort as it is at the Swissotel down the mountain.

The outdoor pool is far away from the heated indoors. When it snows in winter, you have to run out of the biting cold in a thin nightgown to go to the pool. Those who are not in good health will get sick from the cold, and those who are in good health will also have to endure a mental test. .

Compared with other high-end tourist resort hotels in similar price range that focus on scenic views, the design and arrangement of this hotel make people feel careless and do not consider the customer experience.

I originally wanted to stay for 2 days, but after seeing this embarrassing design, I only stayed for one day and quickly moved to the Swissotel down the mountain.

Before check-in, Qi Ju from the Guest Relations Depar**ent helped us arrange the itinerary very well, starting from the airport pick-up, a room with a perfect view, to the ski bubble arrangement at the back, and spent three unforgettable days in the hotel. During the stay, the waiters Anne, Kim and Gao Yang also helped us, such as arranging nucleic acid tests on the ground, and driving the shuttle to and from the ski resort without getting tired of it.

A front desk with no one to help unload luggage
After checking in, I found that the room was cold and there was no floor heating at all. I contacted the front desk to arrange for someone from the housekeeping depar**ent to come and check. An aunt came in and asked, "Are you cold?" I said yes, she said the room wasn't cold? I said if you touch the floor, there is no floor heating at all. She said the floor was cold but the panel said normal, so that was normal. After I strongly requested someone from the engineering depar**ent, they asked the front desk to send an oil tincture to use first if it couldn't be repaired.
After staying for 2 days, the room was cleaned the next day. The water for bathing was not filled, the slippers were not changed, and the mini bar was not added.
The bar staff didn’t know how to mix drinks and I was drunk. The menu only included cocktails.
Except for the hot springs and the view of Changbai Mountain, this hotel has nothing to offer

msg:Service: 9.9/10 All the staff are very nice, and I tried my best to meet the many needs raised in 3 days and 2 nights, and answer all questions. As far as the service is concerned, it is more comfortable than many hotels I have visited.

Location: 6.5/10 It is recommended to determine the tourist route as much as possible and then book the hotel. It is okay if you come to Luneng purely. If you want to see the northern slope of Tianchi in winter [others are basically not open] Nearly 2 hours by car and 2 hours away from the high-speed railway station. Wanda 20 minutes from the airport, 30 minutes from the Luneng Ski Resort, and 10 minutes from the park shuttle [need to wait for the flight] but the room can see Changbai Mountain!

Facilities: 8/10 Satisfied, buffet breakfast, afternoon tea, check in at the snack bar, love hot spring ♨️ [I don’t feel like soaking in winter] Hot water airport shuttle ski pass [Excluding: face protection, gloves, clothes, snow goggles] quite enough~ The missing point is that the TV cannot be cast.

Food: 7.5/10 satisfied, I’m very surprised why it’s not delicious, breakfast and afternoon tea are very good, other meals are really not cost-effective if you order a la carte, the taste is okay, we silently bought the food and came back, hehe there is not much Influence.

Generally speaking, it is a troublesome customer, but all the staff have a very nice attitude and give a good check-in experience. As long as you do your itinerary homework in advance, it is very recommended!

msg:🚗 Transportation: There is a pick-up service, so the traffic problem is solved. There is a shuttle bus available in the Luneng Resort. We are in the off-season in mid-October, so our own restaurant in the MGallery is not open. I take the bus to the Swiss hotel for breakfast. The waiting time for the shuttle bus is not long, and the driver's brother is also very enthusiastic.
🧹Hygienic: The overall hygiene is pretty good
🍃Environment: MGallery's main feature is that every room can "see the white", it is indeed well-deserved. The receptionist, Ada, the beauty butler, was warm and thoughtful, and helped to upgrade to the fifth-floor room with a more beautiful view on the upper floors. After staying for four days and three nights, I was very lucky and felt the beauty of autumn and winter. The steward Ada helped to make an appoin**ent for the bus to Xipo, the shuttle bus will be sent to the Luneng Visitor Center, and then the scenic bus will be sent to Shanmen for ticket checking. In the sunny Changbai Mountain, the sunrise from the hotel is very beautiful, and I was lucky to see Tianchi. This time we came is still a summer project, but it is already relatively cold. The resort area has started to make snow, and there are not many projects to play. Objectively speaking, there is nothing to play in the resort with the elderly and children at this moment. The Internet celebrity bubble pool is really good, but it's too cold to have the courage to try.
🔔Service: The hotel's service is remarkable. Thanks to the good housekeeper Ada for his service. I was lucky to choose a day to go to Changbai Mountain. I saw Tianchi. Anne met during check-out was also very nice, check-out procedures went through quickly and smoothly. The shuttle bus guys are also very warm and friendly.
Meals: There are not many types of breakfast, but it is still okay as a whole. Continuous eating will be a bit unattractive. Swiss hotel restaurant Buddha lunch and dinner set, unattractive, the price of additional a la carte is slightly higher, more than the price of dishes in good chain restaurants in first-tier cities. The price is not high. It is not recommended to go to Wanda when going out to eat, it is very average. Basically no takeaway. It's a pain point.

Staying in Changbai Luneng MGallery during this trip, unexpected surprises continued one after another.
Needless to say the hardware facilities of the hotel, after all the specifications and prices are there, the key is that the location is great, the room directly faces Changbai Mountain, soak in the hot tub in the bathtub to enjoy the white snow on Changbai Mountain, and lie on the bed to watch the sunrise The feeling of Yuesheng is incredible.
The service of MGallery is an exceptional surprise.
Master Yin, who was in charge of picking up and dropping us to the airport, was very enthusiastic. He drove us in a Mercedes-Benz business and introduced us to the customs of Changbai Mountain, the characteristics of the three slopes, and helped us plan the route and schedule.
Concierge Liu Chang, Li Yaokai, two handsome guys are handsome and attentive, because the meal is in the villa area, the two handsome guys will remind us of the meal time, drive us to eat, take us to play, the service is very attentive.
The services of Anne and Ayda at the front desk are also very considerate! ! Seeing that our return flight was in the evening, I specially helped me delay check-out until 5 pm.
Special thanks to Ayda beauty. She was the biggest surprise of our trip to Changbai Mountain. Knowing that my wife is celebrating her birthday, Ayda specially sent a birthday cake to the guest room that night, which was extremely considerate!
When I took a bath in the room, I found that the position of the towel rack was not very reasonable. It was easy to knock my head and reported the situation to the beauty of Ayda. I never expected that beauty of Ayda would apply for two pieces of Changbai Mountain ginseng from their leader to give us. Extremely!
Just for the golden service here, next time you come to Changbai Mountain, you will have to live in the MGallery.

The sunrise video was shot in the hotel room.

This kind of special car service is impossible for other hotels in the park!

msg:The experience of staying in MGallery for four days and four nights can be said to be very poor. The reasons are as follows:

1. Poor service. There are few service staff and low quality. They are often unresponsive. On the day of check-in, I met a man with a southern accent. The front desk was indifferent throughout the process and did not inform any details of check-in rights. I made an appoin**ent for airport drop-off on the spot. However, on the day of departure, I found that I did not make an appoin**ent. I almost made a mistake and didn't remember my name, otherwise I would have complained.
[I would like to express my special thanks to Ms. Qi Jiju in Picture 1, a very kind and gentle front desk person who patiently answered my phone calls before coming to the hotel to inquire about room types and other issues. My first impression of MGallery was very good and I met her again later. She prepared children's toiletries and bathrobes for the children. I also put away the umbrella I left at the front desk for me. It was really one of the few sources of emotion during my trip to MGallery. Thank you again to her]

2. Poor hygiene. The breakfast plate was actually oily and there were personal items in the middle of the plate (Picture 2 was taken out of a pile of plates by me, not forgotten here). The private tableware and public tableware were washed together. Didn’t the staff at the guest restaurant think there was anything wrong when they were put together?

3. The difference between the restaurant and the price is acceptable. Since we came here to eat, we won’t find it too expensive for you to have a dozen small meat skewers for 200+. But we came to the hotel for two days in a row to eat the hotel’s 168 set meal (that is, sauerkraut + vegetarian dishes + fruits + staple food ) Although the portion of sauerkraut was not much on the first day, it was enough for two people. On the second day, it was served in a small pot the size of bibimbap and the portion was surprisingly small. After I expressed my dissatisfaction to the service staff, I was told that the portions of the dishes were all the same. Do you think I'm blind? Finally, we were served a bowl of pickled cabbage soup (plain soup). I couldn't laugh or cry. It seemed like we had taken an advantage. I was speechless.

The overall facilities in Luneng are not as good as Wanda. It is very inconvenient to eat and travel. The rooms in MGallery are relatively comfortable and the space is quite large. However, because of the above unsupported services, I will not come again. I write this for friends who want to book MGallery. just for reference

[Finally, I would like to thank the driver of the park, Master Yin, when it rained heavily on the day I arrived. He came to pick up the airport with an umbrella and used it for customers. He was soaked through. He also paid special attention to the customer's feelings when there were children in the car and encountered bumps on the road. He tried his best to treat them in a special way. Driving at a slow speed. My friend came to check in late at night, and there were only three of them. The chef went to pick him up quickly. I was really sorry for delaying his work. I couldn't make an appoin**ent to drop him off at the airport. Fortunately, he arranged it for me in the lobby. It was so nice. The staff at MGallery are truly a blessing. Thank you]

It doesn't feel like a star-rated hotel at all. The welcome and front desk are very average and have not received professional training. Not to mention the breakfast. There is little variety and the taste is average. The worst hotel experience. This is the first time I write a review on Ctrip. I feel that the money spent is not worth it. It’s not worth it. I don’t recommend it!

msg:The hotel has a good location and good facilities, but the sanitary condition needs to be improved urgently. After checking in and entering the room, the quilt was covered with hair, and the mats of the bed stools and benches were covered with stains. I plan to change the room, but I can't even find the clean one. The hotel at this price also makes guests worry about hygiene conditions too much.
There are several service staff Gao Lengfan, basically ignoring the guests. The tickets for the Luneng Ski Resort I wanted to give the children all the UTV times. The service staff said that one person must prevent the reselling of the experience tickets. We said that there is no reselling of tickets for a family, and that it is to promote secondary consumption. Isn't it because there is a good experience that there will be a second consumption? And the staff of the rainbow slide actually smoked in the venue.
The location and facilities of the Luneng Hotel are good, and we can seriously improve the quality of service to live up to the Meijing Beauty Store. I hope you can improve it as soon as possible.

msg:我們是入住8506.8508房間的，一進到酒店就有很温馨的感覺，前台的服務人員很親切熱情，否給我們免費升級了行政山景大床房，加了前台高揚的微信，回覆很迅速。
    到達酒店後到了漫餐廳午餐，點了幾個菜，出品和口感都非常好，尤其是鍋包肉這道菜，酸酸甜甜還配了各式的水果，實在太好吃了，張成龍小哥哥的廚藝太好了，吃了一餐後，念念不忘，晚餐繼續在漫餐廳吃，再來一份我們都心愛的鍋包肉，哈哈。餐廳的宿傑哥哥親切的笑容，周到的服務，還為我們親自調了雞尾酒，冰冰涼涼甜甜的味道，就像遇到初戀的感覺。
     晚上還到了五樓的酒吧品嚐了伏特加美酒，欣賞了酒店的外面的夜景，美美的，和白天的風景又是另一種感覺。
     值得一讚的還有酒店的無邊際泡池和泳池，美得不要不要的，在冰天雪地泡個温泉，仙氣飄飄，美得不要不要的，再來個幹蒸，這感覺太爽了，哈哈，大愛。
      酒店的早餐品種豐富，也很精緻。
      唯一美中不足的就是衹住了一個晚上，讓我呆三個晚上就更舍意了，我期待下次再入住，是我至長白山旅遊最舒服的一個酒店了。

msg:又到了一年一度的長白山滑雪季，這次選了一個坐落於曠野之上的絕美酒店-長白魯能美憬閣整個酒店非常亮眼的就是木質結構，從整個酒店外觀、房間內、到餐廳的公共露台、無邊泳池旁的休息區，全都是，讓人在雪中感覺到非常温暖
另外一個非常出挑的是酒店的無邊泳池，吃完早飯休息後我們就來啦，旁邊有個大的休息廳，可以點一壺熱茶，更換睡衣後就可以去泳池裡泡着啦，零下二十度的雪季里居然非常舒適，而且超級出片
除了酒店內，還可以沿着小路在周邊散散步，特別是傍晚，整個酒店融入雪中和荒野的情景，感受到了極致的寧靜和孤獨
如果説柏悦是白山現代化酒店的天花板，那美璟閣代表的就是酒店和曠野的融合
入住期間感謝禮賓小哥高揚盧清原 於涵 前台李賀對於入住期間的服務

msg:一直想平復心情後再來點評，但酒店關聯的另一樁官司使得我最後無法平靜。

1. 在前台一位男士負責人預約的事後才知道是雪場非正式教練，説有資格證卻沒和雪場簽約，俗稱私教
2. 一對二費用等我出了事故後辯説衹在教我孩子
3. 碰撞事故發生後到場值班經理推卸責任衹説客户找的教練是有資質的，卻全然迴避私教是酒店前台負責人推薦的事實。私教在指導中不全面、不專業的事實（全程有錄像為證），逼得客户或者走司法維權道路或者心灰意冷
4. 最有意思是最後和雪場同事也能鬧掰，我心想酒店、雪場不是一個魯能集團下的嗎，不團結服務好客人還起了內訌…

我衹能説很遺憾，對於第一次去東北的我們，全家第一站留下了不可磨滅的惡劣印象…

太太説以後不會去魯能旗下酒店，比起牌子對一些人印象分失去的更多。

我的血淚教訓是找雪場推薦的教練而不是酒店推薦的，即使酒店上有再多星或是牌子有多有名，且滑且珍惜。

我還是看到了不少閃光點，很感謝一些人，雪場客服小姜全程陪伴取證、喬先生開車送我們去旅程下一家酒店…好人一路平安。

槽點嘛，就是這個酒店真除了景就是景了，很多項目例如滑雪、温泉、吃飯等都要坐接駁車下去商業街，大概5分鐘車程，每半小時一班車。

價格不便宜，但物有所值。酒店居高臨下、視野開闊，陽台觀景，長白山脈若隱若現。晨觀日出，輕霧繚繞、朦朧浪漫。天光漸亮，景色如照片顯影，一點點清晰明朗起來。
贈送露天温泉、Utv山地越野、迎賓特飲水果，活動豐富。騎**電動車兜風，一路美境。
禮賓部李耀凱、谷雲飛、高揚、Cecilia幾位帥哥美女，全天候服務貼心温暖，真心感謝。
夏日避暑、冬日滑雪，都是不錯的選擇!

酒店設計非常漂亮，位於山頂，景色絕美。酒店房間數不多，所以整個環境也很安靜愜意。
工作人員不多，所以酒店的餐飲服務還有待完善。

來到這裏以後誠不欺我。美到爆炸。
前台服務的小姐姐莫名的親切 笑容很温暖 禮賓小哥哥也非常熱情 介紹權益 有問必答  房間也很乾凈 據説所有的房間都是朝向長白山的。雖然山景房有一點遮擋，但是一樣可以看到長白山（前提是天氣好）。客房的工作人員也很滿意 ，室外的無邊泡池更是無敵了，沒有辦法形容的那種美。雖然在滑雪的過程中有一些小插曲，但那又不是酒店的錯，也不足以影響我對這趟旅行和這個酒店的印象。 .. 喜歡Lilly Cecilia  山美人美的長白山 如果有機會  我一定會換個季節再來體驗一下.

餐廳和酒吧的小哥哥小姐姐們也很不錯，熱情又不過度的服務恰到好處，給這次東北之行增添了很多驚喜
尤其是吃早飯時因為中午要趕飛機，餐廳 谷女士 給打包了水果和麪包帶着，在此十分感謝！此行長白山的感動是美憬閣給的
其他遇見的酒店員工也都很Nice

作為國內第二家美憬閣（第一家在迪慶，後摘牌自營），有些硬件設施似乎沒有太理想，一些細節處還需再磨合，但服務是不錯的
應該説是來長白山必住的一家酒店，絕佳的景觀可以彌補酒店所有小小的不足，還是很推薦的

在這個酒店，我完全放鬆下來，沉醉在長白山林海的靜謐之美中。美中不足的一點是，酒店的基礎設施有點糊弄，洗浴用品比較廉價，早餐品類相對較少。

除了美麗的風景外，我必須感謝管家高揚，李賀，李耀凱和司機姚師傅為我提供的熱忱服務。他們對我非常友好，給我解答所有問題，並幫助我制定了最佳的旅行計劃。這種個性化的服務令我感到驚喜和尊重。

總的來説，美憬閣酒店是一個絕佳的住宿選擇，它在我旅行中留下的美好回憶會一直陪伴我。如果你正在計劃去長白山景區的旅遊，那麼我強烈建議你選擇美憬閣酒店。

1、入住時前面的房客房費比我們便宜好像是600元每天，説是不同平台定不一樣，**提前定會便宜很多。（是我們自己的問題，後面訂的朋友可以看看不同渠道）
2、可能因為我們是最差的房間，三千多一晚，所以房間的網，非常的差，我的手機長期處於沒信號的狀態，或者是一格、兩格信號，我用的是移動，整個酒店就一個無線網，我們住在一層靠中間的房間，無線網幾乎連不上。體驗非常差。（聽説七千多一晚的套房網很好，餐廳網也很好，好像衹有我們房間網不好）
3、入住好多天，水果第一天吃了，後面幾天都是空盤子。
其他都還可以

msg:酒店環境優美，在長白山魯能度假區裏是，最有自己特色的一家。這家酒店的服務不錯，特別要表揚餐廳幾位工作人員，為住客着想，服務人性化，尤其是餐廳的徐小棠、劉欣宇與廚師：宋富娟、陳聚富這幾位留下了深刻的印象，為酒店加分不少，但想提一個小建議，套餐裏個菜品能夠單點就完美了！其他服務人員態度也是不錯，管家式服務，主動來電詢問房間怎樣打掃，諮詢時戴眼鏡的前台服務人員（忘了問名字）不厭其煩自動幫助解決問題，退房時也熱情周到。
但可能地域區別整體活動入夜較早。

msg:酒店坐落在一座小山上，很新，很私密，很安靜，早餐雖然品類少但是味道還可以，門口可以停車，房間隔音稍差。客觀的説還是不錯的。提點建議吧：1、洗手盆下方沒有垃圾桶，很不方便；2、電視總是提示系統故障然後重啟，時好時壞，可否查查什麼原因；3、送到客房的果盤很貼心，衹是麻煩送之前檢查一下水果是否有瑕疵，如圖：我們的香蕉，好像是磕碰導致很軟，沒法吃了；4、也是最Bug的一點，就是水盆旁邊的龍頭閥門位置和玻璃杯擺放位置不合理，一不小心玻璃杯很容易被碰掉摔碎，而且底座還非常不穩。這裏要感謝一下美女前台沒有讓我們賠償，由於走的急忘記問名字了。5、儘量不要把客人安排在一樓，因為酒店的名字叫美憬閣。

位置交通：
園區內有接駁巴士，非常方便。而且整個魯能度假區

服務：
這個必須要誇一下酒店的工作人員了，非常的熱情有
禮貌旦親和超級細緻周到！！！首先，訂房的時候打電話諮詢了Cecilia小姐姐很多問題，非常的耐心，幫我們解決了很多疑問！！入住後添加了工作人員劉暢

msg:長白山之行非常完美，前兩天住的魯能瑞士，後兩天是魯能美景閣，由於當天出發去北坡看天池，折騰回來已經是晚上11點了，聯繫了前台小姐姐anne，派了車去別墅接我們，還準備了水果，看到我們有人過生日免費升級了房型，簡直人間天使～～房間正對長白山，露天的無邊泳池也是景色無敵好！水温41度 非常可，甚至還有點熱[破涕為笑]泡一會就出汗了，一點都不冷！房間有地暖，各方面都表現非常好👍

msg:酒店環境好，服務更是讓人驚艷。從進門開始酒店前台Lrene一直耐心熱情的幫我們辦理入住，還給了我們一個帶陽台的拉開窗簾就能看到長白山的視野無敵的房間。因為我們是外地來的，還給我們講解了好多注意事項，以及幫助我們買票，想的非常細緻。另外一位李耀凱也是全程幫我們拿行李，去泡温泉的時候忘記帶浴衣，主動幫我們去房間拿衣服送過來，我們添加了微信所有需求都是無微不至，開酒店觀光車送我們去租車，以及給我們行程提出建議以及推薦當地地道的美食。住過這麼多酒店很少有服務可以做到這樣，可能因為魯能度假區開發不足，這家酒店知名度也不是很高，這裏多評價一些，這還是一家很值得入住的酒店，酒店含很多套餐，性價比也很高，主要是服務好，讓整個旅程心情都變好。爆贊👍
