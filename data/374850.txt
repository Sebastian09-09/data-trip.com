msg:We spent Cristmas Day at the Intercontinental Dameisha in Shenzhen. A 40 minute Didi drive from Futian and the hotel has a private beach.. The hotel is modern and lovely. Check in was quick and smooth with an English speaking front desk.  We received two complimentary breakfasts from the hotel. The breakfast is a mix of Western style and Chinese and was delicious - definitely reccommended. The rooms were comfy with a complimentary fruit bowl and lots of drinking water in the room. To my surprise the TV channels featured many English channel options. The beds were soft and comfortable, had a lovely bathroom and a small but nice balcony overlooking the sea and pool. The hotel also sports a fitness room, saunas and an indoor swimming pool, a childrens' playroom and more. It is also conveniently close to the Outlet store village. We had a pleasant stay. Only down side was that there weren't many Western restaurant options to choose from in the village, but if you don't mind Burger King, Macdonalds and Pizza Hut, you'll be fine. You can also eat at the hotel and be sure of a lovely meal at their restaurant.

In particular , service is also beyond my expectations, from concierge, reception & also PR Cassie , very caring and asking via WeChat to ensure if there is any need from my side.  Highly recommend. If one wants to have quiet time with more privacy or come for honeymoon for romance, I would recommend staying in their another building called Club Intercontinental.

We stayed in the Club building which unlocks an extra pool and also complimentary lounge access, which included breakfast, afternoon tea and happy hour. There were complimentary towels, sunscreen and water at the lounge pool so this was very convenient. The only downside is that the men’s sauna was not working and the indoor pool was shut during our stay, so it’s a shame we weren’t able to enjoy all of the facilities.

msg:I have done a lot of travelling over the years and to many countries and hundreds of hotels in China and the location of this hotel and their private beach is spectacular.

We have stayed here a couple of times and have decided that we will make it an annual event or even twice a year.

We booked Seaview room and included Breakfast and buffet dinner for both days. The buffet is amongst the best you will find in any 5 start hotel in the world and one of the few that I can actually eat a huge variety of food until I cannot move, most buffet dinners my wife and I just have a nibble and that is usually it.

The breakfast is also first class, a big variety of different food and you can actually eat it and enjoy it. Again we also had very long breakfast overlooking the ocean and mountains.

I recommend it to anyone that want true 5 star service, Amazing Views and Great Food.

My only critisism is that as this is not a new hotel and while maintained in general very good, we did see mild on the curtains in the bathroom and ocean view curtains and that is absolutely not a good thing. Apart from that we are looking forward to our next stay that will probably be after the China New Year Holiday.

The hotel's location stays true to its ranking as the top hotel for family vacation hotel in the area. The staffs speak good English and kind enough to provide me with the complimentary room upgrade. The beach is clean and at the time of my visit the water temperature was just perfect for swimming. The food and beverage selection were quite good. The buffet dinner comes with free wine and beer so a major plus for those who would like to stretch their budget. I will definitely come back.

msg:Perfect for family as there are many facilities including gym, children's area, mini train ride, pool slides, water activity rentals etc. The service was good and overall clean but, the food was absolutely horrible. 

The dinner buffett was the worse I ever had in my life and I've been to top hotels all the way down to 3* hotels. The food quality was poor, it was not fresh at all, the taste was off, even a fishball and shrimp you'd think can't go wrong, tasted like rubber. My boyfriend had to fill himself up with bread for dinner and I ate a bowl of laksa soup noodles which tasted okay but not the meat ingredients. Even worse was, one of the hotel staff asked us to rate them well on one of the local app about their food BEFORE we even started eating, in exchange for a watermelon or melon juice! It was absolutely ridiculous. I ended up having chips and beer in my room after the buffett. 

As for the Breakfast buffet, it was slightly better with dishes like congee and oatmeal that requires no cooking skill or freshness to go wrong.  For a 5* star international hotel like intercontinental, I am so disappointed my birthday was this bad. 😕 .

We stayed in the Club members section which is recommended. The Infinity pool and beach access made it more rewarding, the amazing views helped also. 

Soria has been helpful from my first phone there to check out along with Sisi. Their friendly and approachable manner have made a more relaxing stay. The male waiter in the lounge was also really helpful. 

I will definitely return here as a quick weekend getaway. Until next time 🥰🥰

The staff was so friendly and helped us with local recommendations, finding good places to snorkel, and even surprising our kids with cute little turtles made from seashells! The private beach was one of the best we've seen in China and our kids had so much fun in both the outdoor and indoor pools. Even in January, we were able to spend hours at the beach in 70 degree weather. The pool lifeguard Tony Liu was especially helpful in sharing local recommendations for snorkeling locations and how to rent paddle boards. It was honestly one of the best hotels we've stayed in, anywhere in the world! The rooms were beautiful and the ocean views absolutely marvelous. Can't wait to come back again soon!

The room very tidy and comfortable, the service excellent and amenities very good: plenty of choice for pools and a very nice, clean beach. Although very crowded, due to the season, we could still enjoy some relaxing time, thanks to the great management. The quality of food at the buffet is good…I recommend to try the handmade noodles, delicious! The management team has been very helpful and careful. We will definitely come back as soon as possible!

All of the western restaurants which were announced inside the hotel WERE CLOSED OR OUT OF SERVICE. The only thing to eat is the hotel's buffet.  Outside the hotel, there are not bars or restaurants (only Pizza hut and Burger King). This place is excellent to rest, not to have fun at night.

I would suggest to announce that all the restaurants inside the hotel were closed.

msg:The hotel is in a good location at Dameisha, about 45min from downtown Shenzhen. Rooms were nice, spacious and clean. It's a good get away from Shenzhen. The pool and the beach is the best part of the hotel, but beware that this is also very popular for families with kids. Check in was very slow given the masses of people showing up at the same time and house keeping also couldn't keep up. I didn't get my room until after after 3:30pm. 

The food was fine. However, the dinner buffet was pricey and not worth the value. The main restaurant could definitely be improved upon. My friends and I ended up ordering delivery for food instead. Service was hindered by the masses of families. 

The pool would be a lot better if they strictly enforced the part of the pool where the bar is to be adults only. This is partially done as the water slide and kids friendly amenities are at the other end of the pool. But having an adults only area would be better for everyone. The bar at the pool was also very very slow with their service and I ended up just getting beers as it was the fastest option.  

It's a good get away from Shenzhen, I would recommend. But just be prepared for masses of families with children. Definitely a kids friendly hotel, with lots of amenities catered for them.

The rooms were lovely, the bed was comfortable, and the view from the balcony made it very relaxing. The best part was the beach and pool. The only thing is I found the food at the buffet a bit basic, and the pool bar service incredibly slow. All very small things in the grand scheme! Overall a lovely place to stay, we will definitely return.

msg:I had a great stay at the Intercontinental hotel. I booked myself in for 3 days and the room was very lovely with the ocean view. It was great to hear the ocean first thing in the morning and the sunrise was absolutely beautiful.

The spa was very lovely. After 2 nights at the main hotel I decided to extend my stay for an extra night at the Clubhouse. 

I have to say the service I received at the clubhouse went way beyond my expectations. Amber at the front desk completed changed my whole experience of my stay. From the experience of checking in, her friendly and outgoing personality was so very welcoming. She made the transition of moving from the main Hotel to the Clubhouse absolutely effortlessly. She enquired about any special requests I might have as well as supplied me with a beautiful room with a small balcony with an ocean view. She gave me all the information regarding what was offered at the hotel, from afternoon tea to happy hour.  Her constant reassurance made me feel relaxed. She assisted with advice on the general area as well as putting me in contract with the jet ski facilities on the beach. She went above and beyond her scope of work and I can honestly say this was by far the best customer service I’ve received whilst traveling in China. Without a doubt. 

With regards to the actual facilities, the decor of the establishment alone is absolutely beautiful. The design of the hotel and small details on the lounge is absolutely beautiful. The hotel maintains a very calm and relaxed environment where one can honestly come and relax without the hustle of many guests and a lot of children. For someone who is looking to get away from it all and go on a solo trip. I would absolutely recommend the clubhouse. 

The room alone was very beautiful. Literally equipped with everything you might need and a little extra. I love the attention to detail they offer. In the late afternoon I came back to fruit in the room which was such a lovely surprise. In the evening the they have turndown service with slippers laid out for you right by your bed. 

I honestly can not wait to be able to come again for a little get away to enjoy the amazing facilities, the friendly and outgoing staff. To know there’s a place I can escape to where I feel taken care of and I can relax in a nice calm environment, swim in the infinity pool and enjoy the private area of the beach is definitely something worth coming back for. Thank Amber and all the staff at the hotel all very much!! 
This experience is one I haven’t been able to stop talking about.

Sadly, the hotel restaurant and hotel activities were substantially limited this stay because of Chinese New Year. The town around the hotel had very little food and activities to offer, either. As a result, I checked out of my room one day early. Both the Intercontinental and Trip.com were good about refunding my unused night. We will be back to this wonderful hotel...but never again at CNY..

If you love swimming into the sea, then this is the perfect spot. There are also outdoor swimming pools, but people would stay near the beach, as the temperatures were comfortable. There is an indoor pool as well, so if it's too cold, you can go there and enjoy. I did not try the breakfast, but my wife told me it was good as well. We would have lunch or dinner at the hotel restaurant, and we quite enjoyed it. It was a bit pricey, but the food was good and the portions of good size. Near the hotel there is an outlet so you can go shopping for some bargains. There is a Starbucks nearby if you miss your daily routine from home.
Overall it was a great stay and we'll be back soon!

msg:This is one of the best hotels I've ever stayed in. The facilities, food, services, etc. are all first-class. The front desk also helped us upgrade to a high-rise deluxe sea view room.

🍔Food🥓
Breakfast buffet:
A very rich buffet with a lot of choices, even richer than some evening buffets. You can also see the endless sea outside from the restaurant, which is very beautiful.

Lunch-Mange
Located on the second floor of the hotel, this Southeast Asian restaurant is very delicious. The waiters in the restaurant are very polite and explain the ingredients and methods of each dish. The taste is a bit spicy, but it is still very delicious on the inside👍👍. The restaurant also gave us milk tea as a gift, and the restaurant also has a view of the sea, so we can enjoy the beauty of the sea while eating.

It's a pity that we didn't have the hotel's evening buffet, but it would also be very good to eat at a nearby restaurant👍👍👍

🏖️Facilities🏖️
Hotel exclusive beach
The sand on the beach is very soft and very comfortable to step on. You can play with your children there, check in, play in the water and other activities. Because it is a private beach, there are not many people. There are not many people like public beaches and there is no space to play. At the same time, you can also swim in the sea and play in the water.

swimming pool
Outdoor swimming pool (1.2-1.5) meters deep. You can swim while looking at the sea. The swimming pool is very large. There are two water slides next to it. It is very fun and safe. It can be used by children of three or four years old.

🧹Hygiene🧹
The hotel is very clean. The cleaning lady is very enthusiastic and polite. She keeps the room in good order and spotless. She is a very good person. She was the one who took care of room 1027 on May 22. I would like to praise her very much. The hotel room was very clean, including the bathtub, terrace, and bed, without even a trace of hair.

I have mentioned many advantages of this hotel. Let me talk about the room for improvement. For example, there is a gap in the door of the bathroom, and the ground outside is slippery after taking a shower.

Summarize
This is a very cost-effective resort hotel and I look forward to returning.

msg:Location: 
The hotel is conveniently located. It takes about seven minutes to walk to the hotel from Dameisha Metro Station. There are also convenience stores and beach supplies shops near the hotel. There is a bus stop outside the hotel. It is also a resort area nearby, so it is quiet and far away from the hustle and bustle.

environment:
The hotel environment is very stylish, every area is carefully decorated, and the gorgeousness brings out a unique style.

staff: 
I checked in that night during a busy time in the evening. I especially praise the receptionist Kelly LIU for answering all questions attentively and courteously. Since breakfast was only provided for one person during my stay for one night, I only needed to purchase an extra one at a discounted price of about $100. She understood everything The explanation was clear, and the most surprising thing was that the hotel took the initiative to upgrade us to a high-rise sea view room, which made the trip even more perfect~ It was already 10:30 when we got back from dinner, and suddenly I remembered that I forgot to pick up the bath salts, and Kelly did his best to help arrange for them to be delivered to the room quickly

facility:
The room is fully equipped with facilities and supplies, every corner is extremely clean and smell-free, the air-conditioning is strong, and the wind power and degree can be adjusted independently. The shower has plenty of hot and cold water, and the bed pillows are moderately soft and hard. When you open the terrace, you will feel like you are in an Okinawa resort. Worries are gone and you can relax completely

Serve:
1) The next morning, I went to enjoy the hotel's buffet breakfast. Because I had read reviews from other guests on trip.com, I paid special attention to their services this time (because I purchased an additional ticket). First of all, as soon as the receptionist saw the room card, he quickly arranged for the guests to be seated. There were no computer errors or communication problems. After the guests were seated, the staff greeted the guests to see what hot drinks they wanted to drink, coffee, etc. and proactively prepared and served them. The attitude was professional; the food types There are many kinds and high quality, not sloppy, and very delicious and hot. This time I changed my mind about hotel buffets. Because it was so delicious, I just ate and ate and forgot to take pictures, haha.
2) There are also lifeguards in the private beach swimming pool area. The water quality of the beach swimming pool is very clean. You can see the results of the hotel's careful management.
3) Since you have joined as a member, you can delay check-out until 2 p.m., and the front desk staff were also very helpful in handling it quickly that morning.

Overall, this hotel is worth staying at again. Both the environment, room facilities, and service attitude left a good impression on me. In addition, Ms. Cassie from the guest depar**ent of the hotel also made me feel at home. If I add WeChat to check in again in the future, I can make an appoin**ent in advance. Notify her in advance of making arrangements,
I am very satisfied with this arrangement for the guests.

msg:This is truly a resort that can be reached within an hour! Comfortable environment, professional and friendly staff! Thank you very much to Billie, the housekeeper who received us. She upgraded us to a garden view suite three times in a row, which really gave us an unexpected surprise! And she was very responsive and very nice! She knew we were here to celebrate our birthday and prepared a cake for us!
The hotel also has a private beach with small sand. It is very pleasant to walk on the beach and enjoy the sea breeze!
All in all, this is a hotel worth coming back to!

msg:After May Day, I took my children to stay at the Dameisha Kingkey InterContinental Hotel, which is really the first choice for parent-child hotels.

In addition to the hotel's own private beach and outdoor swimming pool, a series of children's activities are also arranged. The fun projects make the children want to try everything. It feels that even in two days and one night, they can't experience all the projects. At Dameisha Kingkey InterContinental, you don't need to leave the hotel at all to have a fulfilling and happy vacation.

The hotel also thoughtfully made children's door cards for young guests. The cute cards are also equipped with lanyards, so that children can take the elevator independently, go back to the room alone, and keep their room cards alone, which is a good exercise for children's independence. After the stay, the children's door card can be taken back to the children as a souvenir. I like this souvenir so much.

I really like the hotel's outdoor swimming pool, the unbeatable sea view, and the eagles circling overhead from time to time. It is very modern and integrated into nature, and it feels very comfortable~

Thank you to mona from the customer relations department for your contact and patient communication during the early stage and during the stay, which made our family's stay experience in the hotel full of happiness~ I will have the opportunity to bring the children back to stay and play next time🥳

msg:We went to the hotel beach. Originally, the hotel front desk gave us a free upgrade. Later, due to hotel reasons, we were upgraded to a suite in the evening. The suite space and equipment are of course bigger and better. The terrace is huge. Unfortunately, it rained and I couldn't sit on the terrace. Enjoy the beach.
The hotel's breakfast is rich in variety. I like the freshly made noodles and coffee the most, and the fruits are also very fresh.
The hotel is very suitable for family travel, and different free workshops are arranged for children to participate in every day.
Although the hotel provides rubber slippers, it is recommended to bring your own. Also remember to bring a swimming cap. You must wear a swimming cap when entering the indoor swimming pool. The cheapest one in the hotel store costs 30.
Overall satisfied

msg:We chose this hotel for our wedding anniversary, not only because it is only more than two hours away from home, but more importantly, we were looking forward to it because it ranks 30th in the world's 100 parent-child hotels. We booked a deluxe sea view room. After arriving at the hotel, the front desk helped us upgrade to a high-rise sea view room for free and arranged the environment. The first impression was very good. After checking in, a small episode occurred. The waiter responded quickly, and the duty manager Manager Xing handled the result, which made my husband and I very satisfied.
The hotel has a full sense of design, the private beach is very clean, the sand is fine, the sea water is clear, the buffet tastes delicious, the room is clean and tidy, and the service is thoughtful... The 3-year-old child is happy and reluctant to leave, and we are also relaxed and relaxed. Therefore, the original plan to go to the next hotel in Zhuhai was cancelled. We chose to stay for one more day and invited a friend's family to come and play.
See the big from the small, and see the big from the small. InterContinental, we will see you again! (Non-trust)

msg:Praise, praise, praise! Dameisha Intercontinental is the last stop of our journey. In fact, we are already a little tired, but on the first day we moved in, I felt relaxed and happy, and the fatigue of the journey was gone.
Facilities: Fully equipped, with bed surrounds, cribs, baby bathtubs, children's slippers, children's toothbrushes and toiletries. It is very convenient to take care of children. The housekeeper also kept asking us what we need, and any needs will be met.
Hygiene: Hygiene is very clean! We chatted with the sanitation aunt for a while. She is a veteran employee who has been working for many years. She is very nice and very careful.
Environment: It’s great to take pictures on the private beach, and the children are very happy digging in the sand.
Service: Kua Kua has allergen warning signs in the cafeteria. It is very convenient to take your children to see if there is any egg or milk.
Parents with babies can check out the Southeast Asian restaurant on the second floor. There are baby meals and baby restaurants. Babies one and a half years old can also eat, and you can also make requests. The manager is also very nice.
The only thing that is not good is that there are really bugs in the restaurant. One of my legs is bitten every time I go to eat. Fortunately, the baby was not bitten. It may be that there are bugs in the stool, because the baby chair is always sitting on it. I suggest you check it out. , come again next time!

The hotel has a private beach🏖️ with few people, which is suitable for vacation. The housekeeper kerwin contacted us in advance before check-in, which was very considerate. After check-in, he also sent us some amusement projects and nearby food, so that we would not be at a loss when we first arrived. The hotel service and scenery are very good. In addition, the swimming pool also provides free rental of baby armbands and life rings, which is very convenient

Cassie, the housekeeper of InterContinental, was very nice. She helped me upgrade to the room with the best view. The fatigue of the journey was swept away the moment I opened the window. The hotel has a soft beach, a large swimming pool and a water park. The hardware facilities are also good, but because it is too good, there are no alternative hotels around. There are so many families on weekend vacation. There are too many people at the dinner and breakfast buffet. I am most afraid of the noise during the meal. The rich and idle can come here to enjoy the sea breeze during the off-peak hours. The Southeast Asian restaurant on the second floor is also very delicious. It is more authentic than the Mandarin Oriental in Xishuangbanna. The service of the little brother is very thoughtful.

msg:The history of InterContinental Hotels can be traced back to 1777. It is a world-renowned hotel group. InterContinental Shenzhen Dameisha Hotel was ranked fourth among the 20 five-star hotels in Shenzhen by Ctrip, the world's largest online travel platform and listed in the United States and Hong Kong. Butler Bo Song added me on WeChat before meeting me, asked me what I had asked and sent me a hotel map for guidance. He was warm and polite when he received us, patiently answered questions with a smile and introduced the hotel's situation skillfully. We are deeply touched by the fact that well-known hotel brands reflect their service to guests through high-quality employees.
The hotel room faces the sea. Walking on the white sandy beach under the blue sky, the sea breeze gently brushes your face, and the layers of waves on the sea surface seem to be singing in a low voice, which makes people feel relaxed and happy.
The facilities in the hotel room are all high-end configurations in the industry. Every exquisite pastry baked in the executive lounge is full of charm, exquisite appearance and attractive color. The carefully prepared cocktails tease the taste buds with their unique flavor, and the tipsiness is the intoxication and release of the soul. The hotel's breakfast, which combines Chinese and Western styles, is a rich variety and a taste and visual enjoyment.
I really appreciate that the hotel staff's ID cards are marked in both Chinese and English. Chinese is one of the six languages ​​used by the United Nations and the most widely spoken language in the world. Combining it with English, the most widely used language, is also in line with the times.

It happened to be a rare cloudy day during the dragon boat race, so I came to stay for a few days
There are more recreational facilities for children
Adults are quite bored. We walked on the plank road and paddled, but it seems that there is nothing to explore
Stared at the cargo ship in the distance for several days. Maybe boredom is the best mental state
Mona from the guest relations depar**ent is always online to answer questions in detail. The duty manager is also very responsible for coordination and communication

msg:I want to talk about the slots first. The service attitude of the front desk during check-in and check-out is very average. This package includes travel photography and Fun Island, buffet breakfast and dinner. The front desk only explained the buffet breakfast and dinner. Others need to be asked proactively. Travel photography needs to be in the gym one day in advance. We asked the next day and there was no time. The Fun Island activity was introduced in the hotel room before we knew the location and time, and we didn't experience it. This is indeed not as good as the InterContinental service in Foshan. One very inhumane point is the beach. It is the hotel's private beach. You can go there when you stay in the hotel. You can enter and exit at will on the day of arrival. The next day, I wanted to walk on the beach after checking out, but I didn't expect someone to be guarding the door and said that you must show the room card to go. I said I just checked out, and I turned my face and said that I couldn't enter. Why can't I show the reservation information to enter? The room has toiletries for children. It would be better if a small stool could be prepared for children to go to the toilet or brush their teeth. There are also advantages. The service attitude of the front desk is very average, but the service of the concierge is very good, thumbs up. The hotel is indeed in a good location, right next to the beach, and it is private. The room is large and comfortable, the bedding and toiletries are of good quality, the only problem is that the toilet paper is very thin. The buffet breakfast and dinner are very rich and the ingredients are very fresh. Starting from Foshan, the highway is not congested, but it is mainly congested in the city section. It is understandable in a big city. Overall, it is worth visiting once, and I don't consider visiting it again.

msg:I heard from a friend that the club was much better, so I upgraded to the club directly at the front desk. I took advantage of the relatively good price on weekdays and splurge.

Facilities: The club has an independent infinity pool, but the children don't like the infinity pool, so we still have to go to the children's pool next door. There is a big pool slide and bubbles, and the children have a lot of fun. InterContinental has its own beach, the sand is still very fine, and the water quality is also very good. I was really surprised. Maybe it's been too long since I came to Dameisha. I saw stranded jellyfish when digging sand in the evening.

Hygiene: The hotel hygiene is very good, and there is nothing that makes me feel uncomfortable.

Environment: The club is not big overall, but the decoration and decoration are very comfortable.

Service: Every waiter is very nice and will give careful instructions. I would like to especially praise Candy Chen Chengdi from the housekeeping depar**ent. On the first night, we found that we didn't bring enough children's products. After calling her, we saw a sign on the bedside table, and then called her to send things. Later, we asked for a few more bottles of water. Not only did she not get impatient, she sent things very quickly, and she always had a smile on her face, which made people feel very kind. There was a problem with the air conditioner on the second night. The engineer from the engineering depar**ent came very quickly. He found that the problem could not be solved in a short time, so he immediately reported it to the leader. We quickly contacted the front desk to change the room. The front desk quickly changed us to a new room. Candy also delivered the children's products in our previous room and installed them. We were very tired after a day, but the hotel's service allowed us to rest assured very quickly. I will highly recommend it to my friends because it is really good.

Facilities: All the hotel facilities are very good, but the catering is really disappointing. It is really shameful for the InterContinental Group hotel to produce such food, and the level is not as good as the roadside stalls. I am talking about the restaurant on the first floor below ground (because I have not been to other floors). I have eaten there in the morning, noon and evening, especially the buffet in the evening, which has few varieties and the seafood is not fresh.

Service: The hotel staff are very good, but it can be seen that there is a lack of professional management training.

msg:When I checked in at the hotel front desk on May 9, I told the front desk clerk that I would have to pay for a breakfast buffet. The male clerk said it would be an additional 100 yuan. I said it was no problem. After that, I paid the room fee, deposit and a hotel room. The total cost for breakfast is 3,000 yuan.

Then, I told the front desk that I wanted a room with a good view, and then they gave me room 1011. Then, I changed into swimming clothes and inflated the swimming ring, getting ready to go swimming. Before going out, I opened the balcony door and took a look. He looked at the view and his face darkened, because there was construction work going on downstairs, the view was not good and it was very noisy.

I was very angry after that, so I contacted Kelly Bai, the housekeeper at the club, on WeChat. She helped me follow up and changed my room to a room on another floor. The view was much better. After that, I was so happy that I temporarily ordered two more rooms, 1 night in the club and 1 night in the main building.

Therefore, Kelly Bai, the housekeeper, gave me a good impression because she did a good job in crisis management, was efficient, responded quickly, and handled issues proactively.

It's not like the staff in the main building. When you walked in, they were rude and didn't want you to stay. Customers come to your hotel hoping to be happy, enjoy themselves, and have a vacation.

The front desk staff of the main building hotel gave me a very bad feeling and they did not take every guest seriously. I originally booked a hotel room in the main building for one night. Maybe the male staff thought that I was only staying in a clean room for one night and did not Asked for a set meal, had a bad attitude and looked bad. I think those of us who are on vacation alone have higher spending power and are willing to spend. We just hope that the hotel can provide good and high-quality services, instead of treating the guests with bad words and bad faces, as if I owe him money.

Then, on the morning of May 10th, I went to the hotel's Yuan·Coffee 180-degree panoramic ocean view buffet restaurant for a buffet breakfast. I reported my room number at the front desk of the restaurant, and was ready to go in for breakfast. I chose a seat near the window. Before I could sit down, a male waiter came over hurriedly and said, Miss, you haven't paid and you can't have breakfast. I already told you that I paid 100 yuan for breakfast at the front desk yesterday, but the waiter didn't believe it. I kept repeating that I couldn't have breakfast without paying. I was very angry because it was about 9:30 to 9:45 in the morning. At that time, it was the busy time for breakfast in the hotel and there were many people in the restaurant at that time.

The waiter kept repeating that I didn't pay and I couldn't have breakfast. This made me feel embarrassed and humiliated because many customers were looking at me. It made me feel bad because the male waiter kept repeating that I didn't pay and I couldn't. Have breakfast and let other guests believe so too.

Then, the male waiter went too far and asked me to take the elevator to the hotel lobby and find a staff member at the front desk to confirm that I had paid for breakfast before I could come to the restaurant for breakfast. This was too much.

After that, I was super angry. I told the male waiter that you should call the manager or the front desk staff in the lobby. I will not go to the lobby to find the staff because I was not wrong. I really paid. I also paid the hotel on May 8. After the payment was made, Alipay receipts for a total of 3,000 yuan were given to the male staff, but the male staff insisted not to believe me and refused to give me breakfast.

I think this is too much and makes me humiliated in public. The hotel management should provide more training and education so that employees know how to handle crises and solve problems when they encounter them, instead of making guests humiliated and unhappy.

In fact, the male staff can politely say to the guest first, "Sorry, we can't check your payment information. Are you willing to pay for breakfast?"

Alternatively, it can be deducted from the deposit. You should first ask the guests to sit down and talk slowly, not to ask them to stand and talk, because standing in the center of the road, the distance between the platforms is also very close. At that time, the guests next to them are also watching and listening, which makes I am uncomfortable.

After that, I insisted on asking the male staff to confirm with the front desk. After confirming, he said that the front desk said that you paid for breakfast, but because the system has not been updated, there is no record.

Then I said that I checked in at 2 pm yesterday and the record was not updated until 9 am the next morning. This was too much. After that, I went to get food, but I couldn't eat it. I put food in my mouth and couldn't swallow it.

Then, I changed to a room on the club side. Kelly, the housekeeper, was very nice and attentive. He helped me arrange for a waiter to pick up my luggage and find a car to take me to the club. After arriving at the club, Kelly also came out to pick me up. After registering, Kelly sent me there. She gave me a gift, which included a cup and aromatherapy stones. I was very happy because Kelly still remembered the last time I stayed at the club and asked her about turn-down products and whether there were any scented candles that could help me fall asleep.

Kelly actually remembered that I like scented items, which was so attentive and surprised me. After registering, I said that I was unhappy about breakfast and had a stomachache. Kelly also asked the restaurant to bring me hot milk to warm my stomach. It was so comforting. Afterwards, after arriving in the room, take stomach medicine and wait two hours until your stomach pain is gone before you can go swimming.

Therefore, I hope that in the main hotel building, staff training and crisis management can be strengthened and the hotel staff can be taught how to treat guests and have a friendly smile, so that guests can enjoy themselves and feel at home when they come to the hotel. More guests choose this hotel for their vacation.

Finally, I hope that when the hotel management meets, they should discuss how to improve the morale and sense of belonging of hotel staff, and establish a reward and punishment system so that frontline staff can work harder and improve service quality. For example, the Best Service Employee Award and the Best Goodwill Ambassador Employee Award are set up so that employees with the best service can serve as good examples for other employees. At the same time, cash rewards and a good promotion system are also set up to improve employee morale and make them more positive. Put in the work and provide better and quality service to guests.

Finally, I feel very much that Kelly Bai, the club's butler, provides me with good, attentive and high-quality services every time I stay.

I hope the hotel will cherish this employee and other employees will follow her example. I hope to see Kelly promoted in the near future, because Club InterContinental is a blessing to the hotel to have such an excellent employee.

It is very comfortable to wake up in the morning facing the sea. In addition, the hotel's breakfast buffet has many choices and tastes good. The breakfast facing the sea view is excellent. During breakfast, there are two mascots who come to take photos with the children, and there is also a sister playing game consoles with the children! In addition, the children also had a great time doing crafts together on Ququ Island.
The only nitpick is that we took the subway to the hotel. There were no signs along the way and we took the wrong route. Moreover, the pedestrian area at the entrance of the restaurant is very narrow and there is a driveway next to it, which is a bit dangerous.

The facilities in the house are relatively complete, and the small water bar provides enough coffee and drinking water.
The yacht club recommended by the hotel is also very good, the yacht is also new, and the service is super nice! Especially when you meet a celebrity captain! He has been playing with the children and is very responsible

The environment is super suitable for filming

The construction outside the five-star hotel was very noisy. I couldn't fall asleep in the morning when I came out for vacation. It made it impossible to rest well. The children and the elderly couldn't sleep well. The elderly had a fever and the children vomited. The hotel did not have baby meals. Even if I asked to get something for the children, the hotel replied that there was no food. The whole feeling was very bad. There was no five-star service and environment. The hotel also smelled very strong. It was said to be the best hotel in Dameisha, but I really didn't feel it! I was very disappointed and would not choose it again.
At the same time, I stayed at the Raffles Hotel in Nanshan, Shenzhen. I felt that the service was really good and thoughtful to make baby meals for the children. There was also a butler service.

Almost as long as we go to Ququ Island after breakfast, there will be various activities, which is very suitable for children. There are also some recreational facilities on the beach. The beach is clean and the breakfast tastes good.

msg:During the May Day holiday, the family traveled with children and chose the Kingkey InterContinental Hotel. The main consideration was that the hotel has a unique geographical location in Dameisha. The hotel has a private beach and outdoor swimming pool. The external environment in Dameisha can be said to be impeccable and very satisfactory. It not only avoids the crowds of Dameisha Seaside Park, but also enjoys the beautiful sea view of Dameisha. Although the hotel was renovated in 2020, the facilities and equipment may be old and fast due to the high frequency of use. Fortunately, the hotel service is still very good. Mona from the Guest Relations Depar**ent communicated with us about the check-in the day before check-in, and thoughtfully arranged a set of sand digging tools for the children (the little duck with headphones is very cute, and the children can't put it down), mobile phone waterproof cover, steam eye mask and welcome fruit. During the check-in process, they will also care about the guests' check-in experience at any time, which can be regarded as making up for the shortcomings of the hotel facilities. Overall, the children are very satisfied with the hotel's private beach and outdoor swimming pool, and it is also convenient to go out to sea. I will consider staying next time.

There are various children's facilities. Facing the sea, there are also many hotel activities. The bubble party is super fun. It is very close to the beach, which is very suitable for walking the baby. Sand digging tools are also given. There are also super beautiful desserts when checking in. Indoor and outdoor swimming pools. The buffet in the evening is also recommended! Exquisite snacks and seafood dinners are worth it! Recommended! I will definitely stay again if I have the opportunity to go to Shenzhen!

Our schedule changed, and she communicated with us in time and solved it perfectly. We had a room when we arrived. She also helped us apply for a late check-out. The hotel room was naturally very nice. The whole experience was great. During the May Day holiday, the hotel was basically fully booked, but the dining and public facilities were in good order. It was just that the weather was not very good. I look forward to coming again next time.

msg:The reviews seemed good, but the actual service was not up to par. The waiters in each position lacked training. From the moment we arrived at the hotel, the concierge held the car door and asked us if we had any luggage. We said yes. Then the driver opened the trunk and took out the luggage. The waiter watched the whole time and did nothing until we pulled the luggage to the front desk ourselves. Besides, we should have checked in the night before, but the plane was delayed and we didn't check in until seven in the morning. There was only one young lady at the front desk. She had no expression throughout the whole process. She only knew to persuade us to buy breakfast for the children. We said that we were playing outside these few days and didn't necessarily eat breakfast every day. So she started to ask for my deposit and said that breakfast would be deducted from the deposit at that time. The child asked her what the box of lollipops on her hand were for, but she ignored it. In short, the service is not as enthusiastic as that of ordinary hotels, not to mention that it is also a parent-child hotel. Of course, the child lost a room card in the afternoon, and we went to the front desk to ask. Obviously, there are many more waiters during the day, and the male waiter is particularly enthusiastic, and he also gave the child a children's room card as a souvenir. Besides, the restaurant, breakfast and dinner are eaten at Yuan Coffee. The waiter at the breakfast reception was stupid and seemed to have not received any formal training. Since we went to breakfast directly after checking in, there was no information about us on her list. She looked at us and said there was no information. Then we looked at each other for half a minute, and I had to provide her with a solution. In short, the hotel service does not match the facilities.

The baby was also very happy. The breakfast was very rich.

You can also walk. The main building has outdoor and indoor swimming pools, while the Executive Building only has a small infinity pool as shown in Figure 3, which is more suitable for taking photos. We all ate breakfast outdoors, facing the sea, which was very comfortable. A hot dish was delivered every morning. I caught up with goose feet and steak. There were no mosquitoes or bugs when the balcony was open. This is really the most satisfying place.

You could catch fish nearby. There were also many foods nearby. There were waiters everywhere in the hotel to entertain the children. The only drawback was that the beach was closed in the early morning. I bought all the equipment and got up in the middle of the night to catch fish, but the doors were all closed and I couldn't get out. I was so angry that I didn't get up before leaving.

The beach is downstairs from the hotel. Since only guests can enter, it is more comfortable than staying in the public area and there are not many people. After checking in, the hotel also called the front desk to ask whether the membership status has been recognized. As required, welcome fruits, drinks, eye masks, and free refills of mineral water in the room were presented. I am very satisfied with all these. The only shortcoming is the hygiene problem!
Because I am more concerned about the hygiene problem when I bring children out to play, the hygiene of the room is not like the hygiene of this level of hotel. The table and the floor are all dusty. I won’t talk about the balcony. Because there is no floor-to-ceiling window, it is understandable that there is a little dust in the wind and sun. The hygiene in the room is not up to standard, and it is not as clean as the 6-700 rooms. I hope the hotel will follow up and improve the hygiene of the room, because most of the people who come to this hotel bring children~

The service at the InterContinental Hotel has always been of high standard and professional. I would also like to thank Mona for the little card she wrote for me. I am so touched (●'◡'●). The service is really good. The location of the hotel is also very good. It is next to Dameisha Park, and the hotel has its own beach, and there are many entertainment facilities, swimming pools, etc. You will not feel tired even if you play in the hotel all the time. It is even good to stay in the room all the time. The room is opposite The sea, when you open the balcony, you will see the fresh sea breeze and waves. It is very comfortable just to bask in the sun on the balcony. The hotel is very grand, and it is very impressive when photographed from various angles.
The hotel was built in 2007 and is relatively old. There are only 12 floors in total. It's a pity that the toilet is not an automatic toilet. Moreover, the hot water in the sink is a little slow. And the restaurant in the hotel, Cantonese Cuisine Wangfu, is okay. It's around. There isn’t much else to eat, so the selection is relatively small.

🛏【️Check-in guide for InterContinental Shenzhen Dameisha Resort】

📌 Hotel Overview Overview

1. Hotel comprehensive recommendation index (out of seven stars): six stars;
2. Comprehensive evaluation (highlights, shortcomings, regrets): Currently, there are a total of 198 six-star (gold diamond) hotels in Greater China. Among them, the relatively new one is the Moon Seaview on Qixingtan Water in Hualien County, Taiwan Province Resort hotels; the more popular one is the famous Atlantis Sanya Hotel; the more economical one is the Nanhu Bailuyuan Hotel in Lu'an City, Anhui Province; the more satisfactory one is Qingyuan New World (formerly "Qianli") ; Beijing Bayside Hotel has a higher reputation and reputation; Niccolo Chongqing is popular among fashionistas; representatives of luxury style include Mandarin Oriental, Taipei; and InterContinental Shenzhen Dameisha Resort can probably Ranked at position 157 (completely my personal opinion, for reference only), it is a beachfront luxury hotel that is especially suitable for families and families to travel, and it is extremely cost-effective.

🏨 About the room In Room

1. Welcome gifts and upgraded benefits (whether the trea**ent is good or not): The welcome gifts are as plump as they can be: welcome cake (animal cream is made of solid and high-quality ingredients); the welcome dessert is in the shape of an ocean kingdom with an octopus as the center, and it is so cute. My son couldn't put it down and couldn't even bear to eat it for fear of destroying the exquisite and vibrant beauty; two complete sets of sand digging tools; various children's welcome toys; ocean-shaped plush toys; exclusive children's special-shaped neck-hanging room key card … …
2. Room layout and hardware evaluation (whether the room is big or not): The hotel upgraded us to a very large (about 200 square meters) two-bedroom suite with a balcony and a living room with a parent-child theme and sea view (of course, we paid a lot of money for it) Upgrade price difference, haha), this is a hidden room type that cannot be seen on third-party booking websites. It is usually an upgraded room type specially reserved for IHG Diamond Ambassadors or Diamond Royal Ambassadors. The second bedroom has bunk beds for children and related children's entertainment items, such as rocking horses, tents, etc.; the circulation line between the master bedroom and the master bathroom is transparent; the living room is large enough for entertaining guests or indoor fitness;
3. Minibar and bathroom accessories: children’s bathroom accessories are exquisite and complete; the first round of minibar is completely free;
4. Guest room view (good view): It is in an excellent position to view the sea. The transparency of the view from the two balconies reminds me of Huayi, the Yangtze River Boat in Nanjing where our family of four lives.

☕️ Dining

1. Food types and services in the executive lounge (like or not): Club InterContinental and the InterContinental in Phu Quoc Island in Vietnam that we checked in are independent areas, independent gates, and independent single buildings. The entire VIP member area includes exclusive club rooms, a private outdoor swimming pool, a golf training area, a private high-end steak restaurant (which is also where you can enjoy executive breakfast), a business center, and a member rest area (where there are often waves of internet celebrity ladies). Take photos and check in here). The offerings during happy hour and afternoon tea are quite on point. The artistic hollow sculpture of the head in the corridor immediately raises the artistic level of the entire club area by several levels;
2. Hotel breakfast types and services (good or bad): The hotel breakfast room has a Diamond Ambassador area. You can go to the beach, outdoor swimming pool, children's play pool (slide), etc. from the side door, which is very convenient;
3. Hotel restaurant hardware, taste and service: Hotel banquet halls and Cantonese restaurants are of extremely high standards and often host various commercial activities and large-scale weddings. There are many specialty roasted pigeon snack bars in the Dameisha area, which are simple and delicious.

🏊 Hardware facilities Facilities

1. Hotel environment: The hotel is 17 years old. Before joining IHG, it was one of the model hotels in Greater China owned by Marriott, the largest hotel group in the world. Historically speaking, this hotel has never been bad; Four years ago, when the hotel embraced the InterContinental family, some areas were simply renovated, so it didn't look old. The Chinese owner "Jingkey" is a well-known private enterprise in Pengcheng, and its hotel assets are industry models in various places, such as Tianjin Kingkey Crowne Plaza, which we often visit;
2. Gym and swimming pool (new): The gym is in the indoor swimming pool area. In addition, the flamingo inflatable toys in the outdoor swimming pool need to be rented. This is similar to Mr. Wang’s favorite Conrad Sanya ( Has been rebranded as Haitang Bay Wanda Reign Villa Resort Hotel). The opening hours of outdoor slides are limited every day. Please consult the lifeguard for details. There is a swimming supplies store in the corridor leading from the outdoor swimming pool to the main building, selling swimsuits, sturdier sand digging toys, etc.;
3. Children's play: The indoor children's playground is next to the gym, which is more suitable for babies.

🌟 The Moments

1. Highlights (strengths and shortcomings): As one of the top six hotels in Shenzhen, Intercontinental Dameisha has numerous reputations. Even among the more than 700 hotels of the InterContinental Group in Greater China, it is enough to rank among the top 11 in terms of software and hardware. During the holidays, you really don’t need to go to the overcrowded Hainan, Dameisha IC is an excellent alternative. Even if it returns to Nantian, InterContinental Dameisha will be minimally affected because of the hedging effect of the sea breeze, which is extremely rare in Guangdong. Some domestic Intercontinental properties have had ill-fated fate, such as Chengdu Yanlord InterContinental Executive Apar**ents, which were first listed. Fraser Suites Singapore, and then IC, are now returning to their own brands; there are also brands that have always been firmly in the spotlight, such as InterContinental Sanlitun, InterContinental Dameisha, etc.;
2. Outstanding performance and awards for star employees (whether the service is strong or not): Similar to Mandarin Oriental Sanya, the hotel is close to Camp J. Its safety, privacy, and nicheness are unparalleled, and it is essentially different from the same seaside resort hotels. . Kimpton Qiantan opened on September 26 last year. Although the styles of the two are very different, in terms of the quality of the staff and the level of service, they are actually on par.

📍 Brief summary Conclusion

1. Highlights of the journey: Currently, there are 240 IC brand hotels in the world, and there are 6 domestic resort-style Intercontinental hotels: Tianfang, Lijiang, Banshan Peninsula, Qiandao Lake, Banna... The big brother and role model here is naturally Damei. Sand Intercontinental (although it joined the IHG family later) - in terms of marketing, service, catering, and location, it is worthy of similar hotels to learn from. The specific advantages are summarized as follows: close to Dameisha Seaside Park and Xiaomeisha, Intercity Seaside Resort Luxurious experience, sea view rooms with photo-taking facilities, it is a six-star family hotel, one of the 13 best family hotels in the country, and the champion of parent-child category in Shenzhen;
2. Surrounding food, attractions, and entertainment: Turn left when you go out and walk for five minutes to the No. 8 Warehouse Outlet. There are often top-notch products, so it is suitable to shop slowly.

It is worth mentioning that the restaurant Wangfu’s Cantonese cuisine tastes very good and is cost-effective. There are many foods suitable for babies. We ate here for the two nights we stayed. It was less crowded, clean and delicious!

msg:When we came back from Hong Kong, we directly arranged for a five-star Intercontinental hotel. Because we arrived late at the hotel, the room we had booked before was no longer available. They upgraded us to a suite directly. It was really nice and a pleasant surprise. The room is large and has welcome fruits, children's bathrobes and slippers, toiletries (mouthwash) are clearly arranged, and there is a steam eye mask on the bedside. Full of details. The hotel has also arranged some interactive activities for children. Just go and participate according to the time. Some of them need to be reserved in advance. The children feel very good and there are not many people. Breakfast is from 7 to 10:30. There are many kinds of noodles. The noodles are delicious and the chef who makes them is very enthusiastic. If you don't want to go to the outdoor beach, the indoor swimming pool is also very good, and the water temperature is suitable. Our suite has 2 balconies with great views. The hotel also has an outdoor swimming pool. Because it was a bit cold this week when we came, there was no way to go into the water. There is also a small train, carousel, and slide outside. The bathroom in the room is from Grohe, and the mattress is very comfortable to sleep on. They will contact you by phone before checking in, which is very considerate. It is a good choice to bring children to Intercontinental. The most important thing is that you can easily reach the surrounding area.

msg:There is no need to question the Intercontinental brand. I came from the Executive Club. I can objectively comment on the differences between the two: the "main building" is suitable for family travel, the decoration is older, and the hygiene is acceptable. The water pressure in the shower room is low (maybe because the main building here is Not renovated) but the room area is much larger than that of the club. The hotel's highest 12th floor has a panoramic view of the endless sea, and there is a bubble pool and children's water park and beach downstairs. The service in the main building is even better. From the time I checked in, the guy in the front office gave me a free upgrade to a high floor to the guest service, where he made three phone calls to care about the guests and whether they needed to add hotel supplies, making the guests feel at home. Feel. "Executive Club" Please close your eyes when you are traveling with your girlfriends. From the lobby to the infinity pool, you will shock me as many times as you want. The sanitation is excellent, the indoor area is a bit small and the privacy is low on the first floor. When you open the window screen, you can see the outside view, so we basically didn't stay in the room. It's an all-inclusive style where my best friend and I can stay in the hotel for a day without going out. I really love the breakfast, which has both Chinese and Western food to satisfy your taste buds. Here you can see Internet celebrity ladies taking photos everywhere. It’s so good to take photos. It feels like “Is this the Shenzhen I know?” I’ll come back next time.

The turndown service was very considerate and prepared anti-mosquito spray and heated eye masks. When we learned that the cleaning lady had prepared a bag of water for us to make tea, we were shocked again.
Environment: The seaside environment of Dameisha is nothing to say. The interior of the hotel is beautiful, especially the large area of ​​floor-to-ceiling glass that frames the bay into the picture. It is very picturesque, especially in the evening. Unfortunately, the weather was not beautiful this time, otherwise it would definitely be more beautiful. Next time, check the weather forecast in advance.
Service: The butler Kerwin was very considerate, always available and responded quickly. We checked in late and moved the afternoon tea to us after we checked out in the afternoon of the next day. Overall, it was a pleasant trip.

This hotel is located on the Dameisha beachfront in eastern Shenzhen, facing the South China Sea and surrounded by mountains on three sides. It has beautiful scenery and a quiet environment. The design and decoration of the hotel are very high-end, and the rooms are spacious and comfortable. Each room has a large balcony where you can enjoy sea views and sunrise and sunset.

The room we stayed in had a king-sized double bed and a spacious bathroom. The decoration of the room is very tasteful, with soft colors and makes people feel very relaxed. There is a deck chair on the balcony with a platform. It is very romantic to sit and listen to the waves and look at the stars.

The hotel's dining is also very good, with four restaurants and bars offering Chinese, Western, Italian and Asian cuisine. The buffet breakfast there is very rich, with a variety of breads, biscuits, fruits, freshly squeezed juices, coffee, tea, milk, yogurt, cereals, ham, bacon, sausages, eggs, porridge, noodles, pancakes, waffles, honey, Jam and more.

The hotel's recreational facilities are also complete, including an outdoor swimming pool, an indoor swimming pool, a children's playground, a fitness center, a sauna and steam room, and a SPA center. Go swimming, play in the water, play sports and relax. The hotel also has a private beach with fine sand and clear water. We can bask in the sun, play in the sand and take photos there, which is very fun.

The service in the hotel is also very good. The staff are friendly, enthusiastic, professional and responsive to all requests. Our check-in and check-out went smoothly without any problems. The hotel also provides free parking. We feel that the hotel is very cost-effective and value for money.

All in all, we had a very enjoyable vacation at the InterContinental Shenzhen Dameisha Resort and experienced the luxurious resort lifestyle. We highly recommend this hotel and hope to come back again.

In addition, the hotel's catering is of high quality, the afternoon tea and happy hour are very good, the snacks are exquisite, and the drinks are not perfunctory, especially the breakfast, which has many varieties and is delicious. There is also Benedict, which I like, and the dining area can enjoy the beautiful scenery. Said there is nothing to fault. The hotel is worthy of five stars. Not only does the room have a beautiful view, but it is also fully equipped with sufficient supplies. The butler also listened carefully to our needs and made us feel at home. I will recommend it to friends.

It can sleep an adult without any problem. . Since we are members of the InterContinental Hotel, we were given gifts and welcome fruits when we moved in.

The only drawback is that you can't swim in the water in winter. It would be better if the club also had an indoor heated swimming pool. The children's playground in the main building is a bit old and the quality can be improved in time.

I have been struggling for a long time whether to stay in the main building or the administrative area, because some people said that the main building is not suitable for living at all and the service attitude is poor. But I considered that it is the off-season and it is also a working day, so there should not be many people, and it is also the first time, so I can experience the main building first. The housekeeper Bella contacted me in advance and put the standard rooms together according to my requirements. She also prepared a baby bathtub and children's gifts for me in advance. There are also welcome fruits after check-in. Then every day they asked me if I needed any help. The other staff were very nice, the doorman also helped with my luggage, and the cleaning lady was also very enthusiastic. Overall it was very good and I will come again next time. I think the complaints made by netizens before may be because the room price doubles during the holidays and there are too many guests, so the service cannot keep up. Therefore, it is recommended that you travel during off-peak hours, as the experience and cost-effectiveness will be much higher.

From the moment you check in you are taken care of very well and all the staff in the club rooms are very responsive and proactive to the guests' needs at all times. Especially the manager Billy, if you have any questions, he will provide support and help as soon as possible.

The facilities and environment in the main building are also very good, with rich parent-child content. Perhaps because of the large number of guests, there are many charging items, and the service attitude is still quite different from the club experience.

Overall, highly recommended and will come again next time. Thanks again to club manager Billy and other staff for their warm hospitality.

msg:It was a very pleasant experience. According to my visual inspection, the best resort hotel in the Greater Bay Area is definitely not inferior to Sanya. The lounge in the executive club is great. It would be better to have more hot food in the evening, but the breakfast the next day was very rich and even included goosefoot.
The staff are very enthusiastic, especially Kelly at the front desk, who made elaborate birthday arrangements and prepared small gifts for us, and also gave the baby a small shark school bag. The service staff at the restaurant and lounge were also very helpful. When they saw me shielding myself from the sun with my hands, they asked if I wanted to move to a position where I would not be exposed to the sun.

Fortunately, I could still see the sun. The executive club is smaller and more sophisticated than the main building. Designers can be seen in every corner. The subtlety, the executive trea**ent and cocktail experience are great, the breakfast is also very rich👍 We went for the Intercontinental parent-child and infinity pool, and we were not disappointed. Although the weather was not the best, it was still very good to take pictures. We The garden view room I stayed in this time, although it did not have a direct sea view, the view was not bad, and the price-performance ratio was very good. Special thanks to the housekeeper Billie for giving small gifts to the children 🎁 She also thoughtfully helped delay check-out. I will go there again next time on vacation. !

BTW, the group purchase price in ** is much better than that on Ctrip. I booked it on Ctrip. When I went to the local ** to push it, I found that it was dozens of dollars more. In addition to breakfast for two, it also included dinner for two. What a big loss! 😭😭😭

msg:Environment: First-class sea view, it is very convenient to connect to the beach, and it is also separated from public bathers. It is quieter, the sand is very fine, and the swimming pool is large and well separated for large, medium and small children.
Service: The service is very responsible. The concierge helped with the collection and arranged my express delivery very well. All the staff I encountered were polite and handled issues promptly.
Hygiene: It may be due to the offshore situation. The climate in Guangdong is very tidal. There were a few episodes during this stay. A big cockroach appeared in the room during the day. I guess that cockroach flew in from outside, because overall the room was It was clean. Someone from the hotel quickly came to pick up the body... and they quickly arranged for us to upgrade to a better family-friendly ocean-themed suite. There was also a dedicated person to pick us up and change rooms. This is really worthy of praise. It shows that the hotel management is negative. Responsible team.
Facilities: Very suitable for family travel. There is a children's playground and activities for children. The indoor swimming pool is also great. There is a buffet dinner and singing, magic and science experiment performances.

It was a very satisfying stay experience (^^)

msg:🏝I think it is the No.1 of Guangdong Seaside Resort Hotel.

The sea view is beautiful, and sitting by the window of the lobby or the executive lounge watching the boats going back and forth in a daze is also very healing. The infinity pool is really "infinity"! The photography is very good.

The hotel has an exclusive private beach with small waves and free sand dredging tools. Children have a great time and can borrow swimming rings if they forget to bring them. In addition to providing drinking water and sunscreen by the pool, it is really considerate~

You can pay to play water sports such as jet skis, and you don’t have to go far on the beach of the hotel. It is suitable for us who just want to go on vacation.

The breakfast and executive lounge are consistent Intercontinental style, with my favorite ginger soda 😆. The food is not too much, but it is more delicate. There is a small movie theater, and it is very comfortable to watch movies with snacks.

The room is simple and elegant, with ingenuity everywhere, and many small details to enhance the experience of staying.

The club's services and facilities are excellent, even if there are more children in the summer vacation, it can be quiet and comfortable. When you want to be lively, you can also go to the main building to participate in parent-child activities. The main building has a large swimming pool, a large slide, and an indoor playground, and you can go there to play with your baby (I still feel comfortable here at the club😌)

From the front desk to the cleaning staff, they are all very nice~ Special thanks to Dalia and Cathy for providing thoughtful and thoughtful service during check-in, which made us have a very relaxed and happy life these days~

Tea and cocktail party, exclusive beach and infinity pool, adults and children can enjoy themselves. The price/performance ratio can be said to be very high. The butler service is also very enthusiastic and in place. Thank you to the butler Billie for your help and service in the past three days. I will come again in the future.

I asked for so many things, but the guy at the front desk was very patient and worried that I would have to wait a long time. He told me to make arrangements first and then reply to my call. He did things in a clear and organized manner, but I don’t know his name so I can’t praise him enough. There are few people on weekdays and it is comfortable, and the breakfast is rich and delicious. Children's activities include fun island, train, swimming pool and beach downstairs. The service of Cantonese Cuisine Palace is very good, thumbs up. Finally, I praise the hotel for its good hygiene in all aspects. I will come back next time!

msg:I think the best thing about Intercontinental Dameisha is the service. Miss Bella called in advance and added WeChat that day. She learned that we had gone to the hotel to store our luggage in the morning, so she helped us arrange a room in advance. The room I arranged at the beginning was also very good, but it was a little sideways. I would like to ask if I can change to a room facing the sea for the second night. In fact, we had already checked in and used the first room, but Bella immediately helped us change to a room facing the sea, and her colleagues helped us move our luggage to the new room. During the two days we stayed, Bella would always ask us what items and services we needed, and delivered the items very quickly. In short, Miss Bella's professional attitude and service are definitely five-star, which added a lot to the vacation and allowed us to enjoy the vacation in a completely relaxed and soothing mood. The room is also very clean and comfortable. The auntie is very attentive in cleaning, so there is no need to worry about hygiene issues. The hotel facilities are also very good, the beach swimming pool is very good, and there is a bathtub indoors. In short, it is absolutely no problem to play in the water. There are also various children's supplies in the room. Although I don't have children, I still think it is very considerate.
Finally, let’s talk about food. There is a Cantonese cuisine restaurant in the lobby, the prices are beyond five-star, but except for the squab, the other dishes are completely worth the price. I can only say that the level of pricing is not as good as the level of cooking. The dishes recommended by the waiter are not delicious, so don’t believe them. But the squab is really delicious, and it is the most delicious thing in the world. A squab has soothed my resen**ent like other dishes. Highly recommended for everyone to eat! ! ! No one is allowed to eat such delicious squab! ! ! The dove of my dreams! ! !

Afternoon tea and happy hour are very comfortable, even if the weather is too hot and everyone chooses to drink tea in the room, it is quite crowded. My favorite is breakfast, with a wide variety of products.
There are many options for water sports, and you need to walk to the other side of the beach at the InterContinental Hotel.
Finally, I would like to praise Ms. Kelly, who is also the housekeeper, by name again.

All the hotel staff were very friendly. , the sea view in the room is refreshing. On the day of check-in, the hotel swimming pool and beach were closed due to weather. Fortunately, the weather improved the next day, so the children could go to the beach and play with the sand toys provided by the hotel. The buffet dinner and breakfast were very good.

Although it was summer vacation, maybe because we went there on weekdays, there were not as many people as expected. The environment of the breakfast is good, you can watch the sea view while eating, but the Weilan Pavilion restaurant is a bit crowded, and the food variety is not as much as the breakfast in the main building.
The fly in the oin**ent is that there are trees outside the rooms on the first floor, which can't fully see the sea at 180 degrees.

msg:My children wanted to see the sea, so they went to Dameisha between Sula and Haikui. There were too many people in Dameisha Seaside Park, so we went directly to the Intercontinental next to the private beach.

Intercontinental Beach is not bad, there are many shells on the beach, and the swimming area is also enclosed. But there is glass on the beach and an iron rod inserted in the sand, which is a bit of a safety hazard. The sea water is average, not very blue, but Dameisha Beach is just like that. The sea is more beautiful from the east-west side.

The infinity pool is not big, and the staff are always watching it, which makes it feel safer.

The room is fully equipped, but the shower drain is higher than the ground, and water accumulates as soon as the faucet is turned on.

The breakfast is rich in variety and the service staff is very enthusiastic, but the quality is average, with few Western options and mostly Chinese options. But it was a little uncomfortable when a staff member asked me to write a positive review on Dianping during breakfast.

Overall, it's a great hotel.

msg:I took my baby out to the beach when school started and avoided the peak of summer vacation. It was the first time in my life that I saw the sea. After comparing for a long time, I finally chose Dameisha Kingkey Intercontinental Hotel. I stayed in the main building for 3 nights and 1 night in the club. It was comfortable and not crowded. Many services are good. Special thanks to Miss Amber Gan, the club’s housekeeper, who helped us adjust the club’s check-in time due to changes in itinerary. Due to the typhoon, we could not stay in Yinghai Pavilion. She helped us upgrade to a room with a better view and always paid close attention to our needs. , the breakfast and happy hour at the club are both good, recommended to try! Even if a child wet the bed in the middle of the night, the guest room quickly helped us change the sheets. We couldn't sleep on the hotel's original pillows, so they could replace them with latex pillows and memory pillows, which was great! There is also a children's fun island on the second floor of the main building of the hotel. There are handicraft classes in the morning and cooking classes in the afternoon. The children participate every day, and they are very happy! The hotel has a total of 5 swimming pools. Both the infinity pool in the main building and the infinity pool in the club are very beautiful. Swimming is very enjoyable. The only drawback is that there are many broken shells on the beach and the toilet in the toilet is not a smart toilet. However, the flaws are not concealed. I will come again next time. Choose InterContinental Hotel!

Hygiene: comfortable and clean

Facilities: overall satisfaction, the children's playground is relatively small, but the swimming pool and the beach allow children to have fun

Environment: Five-star standard, the private beach is amazing, few people are comfortable, and the sand is fairly clean. The sound insulation of the room is not very good. The view from the room is beautiful and healing.

The hotel provides a lot of parent-child activities, indoor and outdoor swimming pools with slides, a private beach just a few steps away, and an indoor wave pool playground. Children are full and happy and can play all day. It's a pity that the small train happened to be broken when I went there, so I couldn't experience it.

This time I mainly went there for birthdays, and overall I am very satisfied. From the decoration, cakes, and birthday cards, InterContinental is serious about celebrating guests' birthdays.

I commend the butler Judy by real name, she is considerate and thoughtful, and has been in timely and repeated communication before and after check-in.

InterContinental is very good, I will come again next time.

After 12 o'clock, there is no room until 3:30 o'clock, and the check-out is required to be refunded at 12 o'clock. There are few facilities for children to play, and the price/performance ratio is lower than other five-star hotels. They said that the typhoon was coming, so they would not go down to the beach to play. Although the weather was sunny and sunny these two days, too many people went down and washed their feet shallowly, but they didn't enjoy themselves very much. The security guards kept shouting responsibly. The only joy is that the sea view and sky in the next morning surprised us, the film was very good, and the original film on the mobile phone is very beautiful.

The price is similar to here, but the facilities are not a little worse, and the sea over there is a sunken harbor with relatively big waves. The Kingkey Intercontinental Hotel is here.

If there are 10 stars ⭐, I will be full, very satisfied!

Welcome drink, Rosy from the guest relations depar**ent will follow up and communicate with you if you have any other needs, and will also ask in time if you need to replenish the room supplies. During the stay at the hotel, I met several staff members who were very polite, and the cleaning was also very timely. Goodnight milk was also given as a gift, so the service attitude of the hotel staff I came into contact with during this stay was very satisfactory. The two children liked the hotel's outdoor swimming pool very much. They played in the indoor swimming pool in the morning, but the water was a little cold. Fortunately, there was a hot pool next to it. When it was cold, they went to it to warm up. The children had a great time. I ate two mornings and one night in the hotel. There are many kinds of buffet, and I will come again next time.

Members have welcome fruit delivered to the room, and the staff will say hello when they meet, and the swimming pool and beach are also clean. The seafood at the dinner buffet is quite fresh, and the desserts are so delicious that I almost ate them all. There are a lot of children, and there are many parent-child activities. For breakfast, I envy the children next door who have toys as gifts. The older friends also want small toys. It would be more perfect if they can accommodate older friends in their 30s. 🤣When you have children in the future, come over and play with toys.

Thanks to Cassie for her thoughtful service on this trip, I left good memories and experiences for the birthday children.

the only thing that is missing:
1. There is no place to put dirty towels in the bathroom; the trash can is not bagged; the toothbrush is not equipped with toothpaste but with dental floss (perplexed)🤔
2. The elevator is really too slow. I waited 10 minutes to check out and pull my luggage...
3. When playing outside, the baby couldn't find the toilet if he wanted to go to the toilet. The toilet is only indoors, which is relatively far away, and it is really unfriendly to children.

Because the kids got off school late, we checked in late. The staff also helped us arrange check-in and cared if we had any other requests. I ordered a pizza for supper, but it was delicious.
The style of the hotel is really relaxing, and the staff are very service-minded and polite. During the visit, I went to the main building of the hotel~ It feels like a vegetable market~ There are so many people~ I can’t imagine that the administrative building and the main hotel building are not separated From 100 meters to 100 meters, there are completely two situations. If you have children, I would strongly recommend living in the executive club
The child cut his toe in the swimming pool for some reason. The hotel staff dealt with it in a timely manner. They immediately disinfected and pasted an okay stick. Afterwards, they went to the room to check the situation and gave the child some toys to comfort the child. This is really considerate. of
There are not many dishes to choose from for breakfast in the executive club, but they are exquisite. The dishes for lunch are also good, and the dishes at Yuewang Restaurant at night are also pretty good
The overall feeling is much better than other hotels in the same area, and I will choose to stay at InterContinental Shenzhen Dameisha Resort - Executive Club next time I travel

msg:Wuyi finally came to Dameisha to have a date with the sea again. The environment of the Intercontinental Hotel is first-class, the balcony of the room is facing the sea, and the scenery is beautiful. The hotel has its own private beach, which is most popular with children. There are plenty of recreational facilities at sea, and young people absolutely love it. The food in the hotel cafeteria is fresh and varied, love it!

msg:When I came to Shenzhen, I specially chose Dameisha and found InterContinental. Unexpectedly, before I checked in, a commissioner would contact me. Because of the problem of booking a vehicle, I contacted Cassie, who thoughtfully booked a vehicle for me into Dameisha, and arranged a beautiful room for me. If you have any questions, you can find him, and he will reply and solve them immediately. These added a lot of surprises to my holiday mood. Intercontinental rooms are large and well-equipped. Moreover, there are many activities in the hotel, especially the private beach, which is really very private during the crowded season of May Day. Thanks for Cassie's service, I will come again if I have the chance

There are fewer people on the hotel's private beach, and Dameisha next door is full of people. The hotel also has a private pool. Unfortunately, the ktv you want is not free

msg:I went to Dameisha Intercontinental to live twice this month, once for a child's birthday, and once for my sister from out of town to celebrate May Day.
Service: Steady, each staff has a sense of service beyond the scope of their duties. Especially the registration of Jory at the front desk is very efficient and fast.
For birthdays, you can call in advance to make arrangements, and I even sent a cake. The child is very happy.

The room express service is also better than other five-star hotels. It takes less than 5 minutes to make a call in the off-season, and it takes 5-8 minutes to make a call on May Day. Suggest a small value-added service, add a small bottle of mosquito repellent and send it to residents in need. I forgot to take it out for supper at night and still got bitten badly, the hotel doesn't have mosquito repellent. whee.

It only takes 5 minutes to line up for a meal. There are many waiters in the restaurant, and the closing time is very fast. You don’t have to call yourself to collect the dirty dishes, and there will be waiters coming to deliver freshly squeezed juice or new snacks, which is very good. There is also a little story: the chef couldn’t see how much soy milk was left on the countertop, so he stood inside and asked for help to see if there was still one-third or two-thirds of the soy milk. It can be seen that the replenishment of the dishes is quite meticulous. Coffee is also available in takeaway cups.
The young lady from Fun Island also came to the restaurant to find children to play games and give small gifts.
Anyway, both the off-season and the peak season have gone, and there is no gap in service. stable.

Environment: It smells bad when you enter the room, it may be damp. It is recommended to order a small fragrance in the room.

Facilities: In the middle of the month, the steam room and the warm water pool were not open, so I was quite disappointed. Did you go to see if it was open on May 1st? The water was still cold in May, so I didn't play in the water.

The hotel has a main building and an administrative building, which are separated into two buildings with completely different styles. There is a large swimming pool in the main building, which can be used for a full day, and it is connected to the beach outside. The beach is clean, the water is clear and the sand is fine. The hotel also has a lot of different activities for children to play. There is a buffet in the evening. There are many types of food and the quality is average.
There are few rooms in the administrative building, and the hotel also provides considerate butler service. I especially want to praise my butler Kerwin this time. After adding him on WeChat, he will reply immediately at any time, and he can do his best to meet the requirements. I am very satisfied. The hotel's lounge provides afternoon tea and Happy Hour. The quality of the food is good. In addition, the hotel's landscape and decoration are very beautiful, attracting many online celebrities to take pictures. Will continue to stay next time~

Ten years ago, I also visited Dameisha with my husband, and my impression was that it was a gray sea. I never expected that it is managed so well now. Blue sea, clean beach, and my lovely baby, the mood couldn't be better.
The facilities in the executive club are relatively new, the front desk and customer service are very good, polite and generous, Alina praises it. Chengdu city break next weekend, see if there is any Intercontinental hotel.

We live on the 11th floor with a sea view. In the evening, listening to the sound of the waves and feeling the sea breeze, I was instantly fascinated cured. The night view of the cafeteria is also very charming, and the spicy skewers won my heart. The swimming pool has an outdoor infinity pool and an indoor heated pool with clean water. The check-in and turndown service gave the children a lot of toys, such as octopus door cards, octopus dolls, conch turtles, fruits and yogurt, etc. The children were super happy. Dora's service is very good, thank you. Next to the hotel is the yacht club, where you can charter a boat to sea. Dameisha is very beautiful, and Intercontinental is very beautiful.

If it is not a package ticket, it is not recommended to buy it separately. Instead, I recommend the Chinese restaurant in the hotel. Five-star hotels are relatively close to the people. In terms of service, I can’t say it’s bad, but because I went to Kaisa Marriott the next day, compared with the other side, it’s not proactive enough.

The InterContinental Executive Club in Dameisha fulfilled my wish. The location of the hotel is superior, the hardware facilities are complete, the service staff are friendly, and the children and I have a very good stay experience. In particular, the housekeeper Ace followed up the service throughout the process and thoughtfully prepared a gift bag for the child. The child said that the InterContinental Executive Club Hotel in Dameisha is now her favorite hotel, and she will bring her children to live here in the future A hotel, haha, you can see how happy the children are. There is also Keneneth (Zhao Yulong), the manager of the Weilan Pavilion restaurant, who is very attentive and considerate, takes good care of children and guests, is very polite and sincere. My kids say Kenenneth is her best friend now. There is also Kai in the executive lounge who has a good sense of service and takes good care of children. In short, this is a very satisfactory stay experience. I will choose InterContinental Executive Club next time I am on a business trip.

msg:The InterContinental should be the best hotel in Dameisha. I didn’t expect it to be so hip. The room facilities are good, but from the moment I entered the hotel, there was an old a**osphere. When I entered the elevator, it smelled like an old lady’s house.
  This price is not considered a cheap hotel. Instant coffee + a few cents a tea bag is really too low. The coffee machine is not provided, at least it is a hanging ear. A broken bag of instant coffee is really bad.
  The swimming pool is dilapidated, and what is more polite is the steps into the pool
It is made of large-grained frosting, and the steps cannot be seen clearly when walking in the water, and both feet are scratched and bleeding. The place where the tiles fall off is just wiped with cement, and if you accidentally bump your arms and legs, it will definitely be scratched.
  When I checked in, I asked if I was a member. I am a gold card member. I offered to send a piece of welcome fruit in the afternoon, but I didn’t deliver it in the afternoon. After 6 o’clock, the customer relationship manager took the initiative to call to ask about the satisfaction of the check-in. It didn’t arrive, but the manager said to arrange to deliver it right away. I went shopping, and no one delivered it until ten o’clock. Too bad
   The service is really bad, let’s put the hardware first. If the service can’t keep up, it’s useless to say anything. I’ve lived in so many InterContinentals, but Shenzhen Dameisha InterContinental is really a bad one. I’m sorry for everyone.

The view of the hotel is not bad, the breakfast is good, and the seafood buffet for dinner should be the most satisfactory of this stay

I arrived very late with complaints. I felt very comfortable when I entered the hotel. After taking the room, the decoration style of the room was completely to my liking. The quilt is very comfortable, and it has all the facilities for children, such as toilet seats and footstools. Even Marriott doesn't have these, so it feels very warm. The seafood in the evening buffet is very fresh, and the service attitude is very good. In the morning, I entrusted my children to Fun Island. The little brothers and sisters inside were very patient and made me relax all morning. When the weather is good, the sea is really beautiful, and the beach is very clean. There are always people cleaning the beach, but every detail is very good. In place, the children just don't want to go to the end.
When I left the store, I found that the clothes were forgotten. When Ms. Dora from the after-sales depar**ent of the hotel visited me, I mentioned this matter. Ms. Dora found it immediately and paid for the shipping fee to send it to my home. She also gave me a cute doll Super happy, the last Miss Dora is really the finishing touch, thumbs up! In short, this trip is very happy, and I am very satisfied with every corner of the hotel.
It's just that the young lady who cooks vegetables and noodles for breakfast in the morning is in a bad mood and speaks aggressively. The little girl can tolerate her emotions.

I opened Ctrip, searched for parent-child hotels in Zhuhai and Guangzhou, and finally settled on the InterContinental Dameisha Resort in Shenzhen. First of all, I was attracted by the brand, and then clicked on the online review, and the satisfaction was quite high. Is it decided in one noon? .
1. Environment: The room is quite large, with new hardware facilities and complete equipment.
2. Catering: Our package includes buffet dinner and breakfast, with a complete range and good products.
3. There are quite a lot of projects suitable for parents and children. From the first day to play, the children are still reluctant to leave at 6 pm the next day.
4. Sister Cassie from the guest relations depar**ent gave her a big thumbs up for her meticulous service.
This time I came to celebrate my daughter's birthday. The hotel thoughtfully sent cakes and birthday decorations. The child said he would come again next time, looking forward to it! !

First of all, the executive floor was separated from the main hotel building to create a hotel within a hotel. This concept has been more than half successful;
Ms. Soria's thoughtful and enthusiastic service at check-in was impressive;
The sea view from the lobby, guest rooms, and executive catering area makes every penny I pay worth it;
The afternoon tea and HH of the executive trea**ent are of high standard, and the breakfast is very rich;
In the end, maybe the hotel is really great, and there are many internet celebrities to watch😊

The breakfast is a bit lacking, the options are not as many as other hotels, and there are not many local characteristics, but it can still meet daily needs!
It's very suitable to stay with the baby, because the environment stays for another night! There is an indoor activity room, although it is not big, it is enough to meet the needs of children! The indoor swimming pool is divided into different sizes, and the small pool has a temperature of 38 degrees. The children had a great time playing! There are small trains and carousels in the hotel, and there are indoor and outdoor activities for parents and children every day, very nice~
There are not many people on the hotel's private beach, and the sand is very soft. The baby can dig for 2 hours, freeing parents!

When I went to the room where there was no room, the sister at the front desk arranged a doorway for entering and exiting the beach and gave a set of toys to play with the sand. When I learned that there were two children, I also gave two lucky rabbits. You can see the sunrise when you lie on the bed in the room , there are welcome fruits, and small snacks are delivered to the room at night. The family's birthday was not noted when we checked in, but the housekeeper, Ms. Dora, helped arrange the birthday cake. Even if it felt cold at 11 o'clock in the middle of the night, the housekeeper was able to arrange the quilt in time. The surprise is the bubble show in the children's pool, no matter how cold the weather is, it can't stop the children from getting into the water. The hotel is about a 10-minute drive from the OCT in the east, and it only takes an hour and a half from Guangzhou to come here, so I decided to give up Huizhou.
Dameisha Fun Island | Children's parent-child activities and exquisite travel pictures need to be reserved one day in advance.

The leading brands in every industry are hard to be surpassed, especially the core of service spirit and the detailed feeling for customers. The room that was awarded this time happened to be able to see the sunrise, and I saw two different sunrise states in two days. The quality of the beach and sea water are good. Just to mention one point, I hope the water in the children's swimming pool pays attention to the water quality, instead of just changing it mechanically every day. At seven or eight o'clock in the evening, the water was already cloudy.

The hotel has an indoor swimming pool and an outdoor children’s pool, but it’s relatively cold outside now, so you can’t go into the water. Children dig sand and play on the beach. Playing in the water is still possible. The beach is very fine and white, and the Dameisha public beach in the distance is much less crowded than the public beach. It is also very clean. The hotel management is also relatively good. The room can only be cleaned after 3:00 p.m.

I don't envy the fairy in the clouds if I steal the floating life.
——Da Mei Sha Ji at Shenzhen InterContinental Executive Club

Kui Mao first month, the shore of Yantian.
Kingkey InterContinental is ******* by dreams.
One sand and one stone, one reef and one island.
Thousands of sails are exhausted, and all sounds are sold out.
Emotional clouds, blue sea.
Delicate shallows, gentle breeze.
Your Excellency Weilan, do you know the way ahead?
Why worry? Luxie Gongchou.
There is dust in the troubled times, dazzling and colorful.
The clear pool is boundless, and man and nature are one.
The towering outpost, the sound of waves is powerful.
How can there be peace? Strong men guard the border.
The lover is full of love, and the childish heart is happy.
The desire is still there, and the leisure time is short.
Meisha rides the waves, the wind blows the harbor,
The journey is long and the future is long.

The housekeeper, Kelly, is very polite.
Generous and beautiful, elegant and subtle.
Careful attention to detail.
Great care, especially grateful.

I write not because I have talent, but because I have feelings.

msg:There are too many people in Sanya during the Chinese New Year, so I chose InterContinental Dameisha. On the first day of arrival, the occupancy rate was very high. While waiting for the room card, I tasted the afternoon tea set in the lobby. Due to the large number of people, the waiters were a little busy, but the products were all satisfactory. Entering the sea view room is refreshing, and the New Year's snacks provided by the hotel are beautiful and delicious. It is the first time for a 4-year-old child to have close contact with the sea. Although the temperature is 23 degrees, it is not suitable for going to the sea, but walking on the beach and feeling the washing of the sea water is also very exciting for the children. The hotel Fun Island has many parent-child activities suitable for 3-10 years old every day. , Chinese New Year people often need to make an appoin**ent by phone one day in advance. There are quite a lot of children's activities in the hotel. It is not boring for us to spend three days in the hotel with our children. If you come to play in summer, children who participate in water sports will be happier. Both floors B and 2F have a buffet breakfast. Floor B is richer but crowded and noisy. Personally, I prefer the Italian restaurant on 2F. The environment is good and the variety of Chinese food is slightly less, but it is still rich. The Cantonese Wangfu restaurant on 1F is doing very well. It may be because the hotel is more partial to the hotel guests. Most of them choose this place for lunch and dinner. They ordered a few dishes and they were all delicious. Hope to come again when the weather warms up.

It can be said that it is a good choice for couples and business trips ~ I want better It’s a room type, but only this package. Now the occupancy rate of the hotel is too low, ten rooms are empty, so even if the check-in is not too early, the front desk is very nice to help us arrange the eighth floor of the highest floor of the common room. Although we only stayed for one night, there were 6 bottles of free mineral water in the room, as well as children's grooming kits. The front desk even called to ask if we needed anything else~ We walked on the beach in the afternoon and met a couple who were having a wedding , It's just that the weather is bad and it rains a little, so we can only go back to the hotel. Both breakfast and dinner are served at Yuan Coffee. The restaurant is quiet because the occupancy rate is low. Dinner is a small hot pot per person and three oysters per person.

The hotel's buffet breakfast is a combination of Chinese and Western, rich in variety, enjoy the sea view while eating breakfast, and the meal is not closed until 10:30 in the morning. The seafood buffet dinner is also worth trying, and there is a band singing at night (the singing is great), here, I spent a very perfect holiday.

msg:I came here to celebrate my birthday in 2009 when it was Sheraton. I didn't expect the hotel to be so well maintained after so many years. I think it's the ceiling of the parent-child hotel in Shenzhen. First of all, it is very close to the urban area, and then there is a swimming pool under the room, and the private beach is connected to the swimming pool, which is simply too convenient. Each room is a serious sea view room. I have relatively high hygiene requirements because I have a one-and-a-half-year-old baby. The room met my requirements. You can see the sea while lying on the bed, which is very healing. In addition, the room service is very timely. Whether it is an extra bed surround or a bathtub cover, any request can be processed very quickly. This is very important. The only reason why the service is not very satisfactory is that we stayed for two days, and I gave my mother an extra room on the second day. The request was to be next to my room. As a result, the guy at the front desk didn’t have a room that day, and it was five years away. The room was given a double bed. As a result, I looked at the balcony from day to night, and there were no people in the left and right four to five rooms. We are traveling at the wrong peak, and the room is actually quite sufficient. I really don't understand his arrangement. Also, the baby's entertainment place is very small, there is nothing to play, the air-conditioning inside is not enough, it is a bit stuffy, other things can be given full marks. The Yuewang Restaurant downstairs has very good products, and the set menus are very discounted. We basically settle there for the past few days. recommend.

Free breakfast and afternoon tea after check-in. This is the newly expanded club of InterContinental Hotel. The two are separate. If you book an InterContinental Hotel, you won't be able to get to the club, so you should check it out when you book the hotel. The room is also matched with a personal butler Kelly who is super caring and very enthusiastic and is a very good lady. If you have any inconveniences that you don’t understand, the housekeeper will answer you one by one. It’s very comfortable to sit on the beach at night, eat barbecue and drink some beer while blowing the wind😌

There are welcome fruits, two sets of children's supplies are prepared in the room, and there is bedtime milk at night, which is really touching. During the stay, the hotel called from time to time to ask for warmth, and there was an invisible menu for dinner. Special thanks to Cassie Xiaowu!

The most important thing is that the service staff are very enthusiastic and there are many people. Whether it is in the hotel or on the beach, they are full of service staff and very enthusiastic. You don’t have to worry about finding people. The breakfast buffet is also very good, with many varieties. Food is constantly being added until 10:20. There is no such thing as other hotels picking up things when they are ordered. Very satisfying. The service staff will often come to ask if you need help. There are also staff on the beach who are constantly cleaning and keeping it tidy. It is really not easy for the hotel to do this regardless of the cost~ InterContinental's staff training is really in place and I am always satisfied. Just to give a suggestion. On the beach, I found that the staff will check whether some people who come to the beach are hotel guests. In fact, it is very easy to get in. There are non-hotel guests next to it. It is recommended that each hotel guest give a hand card to keep the beach guests. indeed a hotel guest

msg:Staying at home every day during pregnancy would be stupid, so I decided to stagger the peak period to go to the beach, and finally chose Dameisha Kingkey Intercontinental. Booked a high floor sea view room.
I received a phone call from the hotel the day before check-in and asked me what my needs were. In fact, I didn’t know after all I had never stayed in this hotel, so I said that I was traveling during pregnancy and the room was clean, so the lady said that she would help me with it. Do a deep cleaning of the room.
Arrived at the hotel the next day, there were not many people, and the check-in went smoothly. The room was clean and had no peculiar smell. The blue of the sea when the window was opened was really beautiful.
The hotel has a lot of equipment for children to consider. Unfortunately, our baby has not been born yet. For two days, we took a walk on the beach and took a seat. The weather is good, and the autumn wind is not dry. The most important thing is that there are really no bustling crowds on normal days, but it is not deserted either.
I heard someone knocking on the door after dinner in the evening. It was the service aunt who gave me two boxes of yogurt. I don’t know if it was extra because I was pregnant because I didn’t seem to have this item when I booked the hotel. Things are not expensive, but they are warm.
Register as a member and bring your baby to play in the future. Nice experience!
The only small flaw is that the ceiling shower pipe was broken when I took a shower, and the water was sprayed into the dry area of the bathroom. Later, it was turned off and no longer needed. I hope these facilities can be checked regularly.

Exquisite travel pictures: very beautiful. 5 free photos, more than 30 yuan without retouching, and 50 yuan per retouching. We shot it at 12:30 noon. The disadvantage is that it is too sunny. The advantage is that the light is good, there are very few people, and the filming effect is good.


Facilities: I used to live every year when I was a Sheraton. Later, I changed it to Intercontinental. I have never brought my baby here because of the epidemic. The overall maintenance is very good. After all, the maintenance cost of a house by the sea is very important.
The swimming pool is more diversified, more suitable for children to play, and the effect of filming


Hygiene: We went to Xiao Tai during the National Day holiday. We checked in on the 6th. There were quite a lot of people, but the hygiene was still very clean. I think it has always been good.

Environment: It belongs to the best parent-child vacation place in Dameisha

Service: The service is very good. Although it is National Day, it is very considerate. I gave a check-in gift, and the child's birthday also gave a cake, fruit and yogurt. There are many surprises.

Cantonese Cuisine Palace: I am a mother with three babies, so all food is handled at the hotel. The food in Cantonese Cuisine Palace is delicious, and cleanliness is the biggest guarantee for my travel.

In the end, there is only one area that needs to be improved, and it varies from person to person. The mattress in the hotel is very comfortable, and it is also a top brand, but the pillow is down, and it collapses when I sleep. I am a person who has requirements for pillows. , I was already tired from watching three babies during the day, but I couldn't fall asleep one night because the pillows were not suitable. If there are latex pillows for guests to choose, it will be more perfect...

I originally wanted to stay in the hotel for leisure, but I was forced to go out in order to keep the green code, which increased the risk of the epidemic. It is recommended that such a large hotel arrange nucleic acid in the hotel when the occupancy rate is high and the traffic is large.

Love this hotel so much 💞💞💞! Be sure to book a club room with a private beach and an infinity pool! Compared with the people in the main building area, it is very big! When you go to bed at night, you can hear the sound of the waves, the holiday a**osphere is full, and you can enjoy the comfort of escaping the city~
The personal housekeeper Kelly is very caring and helped me to upgrade the room type for free, with a big sea view bed, responsive to my needs, very chill during the vacation, gave me a gift when I left, I like it very much!
in addition! The hotel breakfast is very delicious, the ingredients are very fresh, I recommend hor fun and wonton noodle soup, plus a cup of iced latte, with a small dessert, absolutely 😋😋💓

The bed surround for the children is also the safest and cleanest one in so many hotels we have visited this year. The children's toiletries and small slippers are extra points. The mattress is very comfortable. The main building The scenery is very good. I originally bought the Yinghai Pavilion package in the administrative area this time. I temporarily booked the main building to try it out. The environment is better than the online reviews. The swimming pool facilities downstairs are relatively large, and the activities are very interesting. , I commend the chef who is in charge of cutting the noodles for breakfast on September 16th, and the children's noodles are specially cut finely. The buffet dinner selection was a bit limited, not particularly impressed with the food. The small details of the room still need to be improved. When I went back to the room last night, I saw that drinking water and yogurt were replenished. Although I didn’t take the initiative to turn on the turndown service, the waiter came in and saw that the room was so chaotic and didn’t help to clean it up. ], the trash cans are full. I used to take the initiative or ask about the turndown service when I stayed in the hotel, the welcome fruit of Ctrip members. This time is the most simple one I have seen. Before staying on an anniversary or birthday, I usually upgrade the room. Or late check-out, the room arranged this time is relatively biased, next time I have the opportunity to bring children to try the administrative area, thank you Cassie Xiao Wu for the service ~ I almost forgot, I hope the hotel's electronic motorized entertainment facilities will not be placed next to the cafeteria, children eat Eating is not stable, eating two bites and seeing arguing to play really cost my parents.

health:
The room is clean and fresh
The sea is very clear, transparent blue-green

Serve:
1. The concierge service is in place. When you get off the bus at the door of the hotel, you can help pick up your luggage.
2. Slippers can be borrowed on the first floor. The details are full, and it is very convenient to go to the beach.
3. There is no sign of the welcome fruit, which was once thought to be a room decoration
4. Check out at 12 o'clock, which is too early, resulting in basically having a breakfast the next day.

breakfast:
The categories are relatively rich, but the expensive ingredients are not too much, and the fried rice noodles are delicious! ! ! !

Exquisite travel pictures:
There are actually five travel photos in the package. Multiple options are 30 yuan per photo. The shooting points are on the beach and the viewing platform. You can go to Xiaohongshu to find the shooting action by yourself.

The slippers and toiletries in the room are for three persons, and there are special children's models. There are obviously fewer people during the week than on the weekend. Like me, those who like less people can choose to travel during the week. Some time there will even be a private room. The breakfast is richer, and the infinity pool is very beautiful to take pictures. It takes about 10 minutes to walk to the nearest nucleic acid point, which is more convenient. It is recommended to choose a day to eat seafood at Yantian Food Street, which is only three or four kilometers away from the hotel.

The fly in the oin**ent was that yesterday when I was in the outdoor swimming pool, the outdoor swimming pool was closed because of some trouble. After I complained to Ctrip, the hotel customer manager upgraded it to the club's swimming pool. I really want to praise Ctrip's service here. One thing to say, the club is more suitable for young people to punch in and take pictures. If it is the main building of a family with children, it is better, because there are many more items in the outdoor swimming pool.

When I booked, it said that there is an executive club afternoon tea And happy hour, but you have to take a battery car to go to another building, and it is troublesome to wait for the car. Although it is the Spring Festival, this is worth 4,000-5,000 yuan at most. I wanted to change rooms to the executive club. What is the difference between the two buildings at the front desk? He actually answered that the building where I live is more suitable for bringing a baby, and there are more activities. I can't see where there are more activities. Such an answer is too obvious. I don't think I will stay in an Intercontinental hotel again in the future.

Surprisingly, the bath products are byredo lobby with free afternoon tea, happy hour, etc. The mini bar in the room is also free
Breakfast is also included and there are so many choices!
It's not bad to bring children because you won't make dumplings on the beach. It's also cleaner.
And the operation manager sisi z's service is super good because she chose to upgrade the "ambassador membership" because of her friendliness, there will be corresponding preferential services, and you can bring children next time.

Kingkey Intercontinental is a renovated Sheraton. The room is a little long, but the service is very good. This is not a club. Sisters who want to live in an online celebrity shop should see it clearly and then make a decision. The house price there doubles, and the minimum is about 3000+ per room.
The breakfast and dinner buffets are not as delicious as expected, and there is no distinctive local flavor.
Our room was upgraded for my little brother. We live on the 10th floor. The moment we entered the room and walked to the balcony to see the full sea view, it was very healing. The feeling of seeing the sea when we opened our eyes in the morning was really pleasant!

The beach is very clean in the morning, the swimming pool is the best, the children's pool is warm, and there are interactive children's programs, so you won't get tired of soaking in the water every day. The breakfast is ok, the buffet dinner is not recommended, there may be few people. There is a street outside to eat seafood is very flavorful. I don’t have time to go to the scheduled courses. Children just want to soak in the swimming pool, shovel sand, and soak in the bathtub every day, which is very time-consuming. Thanks to Fify for the caring service, the response is very timely, the work is in place, and the hotel will be visited again

msg:This resort is good value for money.
The sanitation of the room is good, and the sanitation of public places needs to be continued. For example, the restaurant (Yuan Coffee) found that the dishes were not clean enough, and hair was found in the bowl.
Some staff are not enthusiastic enough. For example, when a child is separated from his parents while playing in the swimming pool, he asks for a lifeguard, but one of the lifeguards is indifferent. The child had to turn to another lifeguard again to get help. This should not be the case with a five star resort hotel.
The overall environment of the hotel is good, some parts of the environment are a bit old, such as the locker in the locker room.
Individual front desk check-in staff are not familiar enough with the business.
Through the hotel phone number left on Ctrip, I called in and found that the person answering the phone was very indifferent. They asked a question and answered a question, and the relevant depar**ent managers could listen to the recording of the call.
Overall, the children had a good time at the hotel, the breakfast was good, and the private beach sand was fine and clean.
Special praise to the manager of the concierge depar**ent, Xie Guangyun, for his warm and professional service.

When I arrived at the hotel at 12:00, it took almost an hour to queue up at the front desk to check in, and my waist was bad! Then it was told that you could get the room card at 3 o'clock, so it took more than half an hour to get the room card... Picture 2 is the state of getting the room card. Five-star hotels really can't afford the efficiency of this service! And the consumption of the entire hotel is too exaggerated, how many times more expensive than outside? Look at picture 1... I feel a little bit taking advantage of the epidemic to raise prices. The most important thing is the white sign on the floor by the pool, my dad slipped on it! In an instant, the left calf was swollen and bruised! Inform the staff that there is an ice compress for the first time, but there is no concern or inquiry in the later period! The signs on the ground have not been removed. This is enough to give bad reviews and complaints! The first time I got home was to take my dad to the hospital to see an orthopaedic surgeon. His knee was so painful that he couldn't walk! The design of the lobby is also not good! There are ditches everywhere, so many children fell down accidentally, and I saw two men fall. . Shenzhen's No. 1 parent-child hotel, I won't go there again!

🚗 Traffic: An hour's drive, I went on Sunday off-peak, not very congested~

🍃Environment: Invincible sea view. Sitting on the balcony of the hotel and blowing the sea breeze feels great value. The beach of the hotel is very clean and the sand is soft. There are four outdoor swimming pools, two of which are children's pools. Children have a lot of fun~ Every day There are also activities for children, which are highly interactive. The only fly in the oin**ent is that the playground is relatively small~
🔔Service: Very nice, there are a lot of requirements for check-in, and they are all fulfilled after arriving at the store, and it can be seen that all the staff of the hotel have been professionally trained, and everyone is very friendly. I gave a souvenir to the children, the children's door card is very good~
After checking in, I took a short video, Amway made friends in the circle of friends, and a good hotel should be shared~
Finally, thank you Teresa, Director of Guest Relations for her service 🌹

We must book a room in the executive club. Because our car was parked in the old building, we passed the lobby on the first floor there. The smell of the nose, the noisy crowd, my son described it like an airport VIP lounge in a second-tier city 😅. As soon as I entered the executive club area, I immediately felt completely different. Although there were many people at the wedding on the day I arrived, it did not affect the service quality at all. The housekeeper Alina had contacted me about check-in by phone before my arrival, and the room arrangement also tried to meet my needs, which is commendable. The overall style of the executive club is very similar to the Sanya EDITION, with a strong sense of design, strong holiday style, and delicious breakfast. Five-star recommendation!
If it hadn't become a popular place for weddings and internet celebrity check-ins, it should feel better. Therefore, it is recommended to stay away from popular times.

The enthusiasm at the front desk and the brother at the door help with luggage. What impresses me the most when I come to the hotel is them. Usually you won't find them, because they are all the cleaning staff who pay silently. maintenance staff. The aunts and uncles who cleared the fruit plate and swept the floor were the biggest contributors behind the hotel! Without them, we would not have a comfortable environment. Thank you, they paid for us. Although it is their work, I can also appreciate the hard work behind them. We go to enjoy, such as messing up the room, they all clean for us, I hope everyone can give them a smile and a warm greeting next time they see them. Picture 10 is the one that impressed me the most. His name is Aunt Zhao Xiaoxue. Thank you, friendly service attitude and kind smile, hope to see you again next time. I wish you good health and good work. Every day you meet good people and good things.
I would also like to thank Johnson Zhu from Xi'an Hall, thank you for your warm greetings, and I would like to thank your colleagues here. Although there is no way to write down the names of your colleagues, I have seen them at breakfast and dinner during my stay. Every colleague, aunt and uncle who prepare and serve us attentively for us, including the collection of furniture, although it is your job, the spirit of dedication and work has won us over often. Knowing that you have a decoration, I hope you can enjoy sitting there for a drink next time you come!
I am happy for your company to have you employees in the hotel, because of you, we will definitely come here often. By the way, I also want to thank a little fat brother from the engineering depar**ent who wears black-rimmed glasses. He helped fix things in the room before he had time to ask his name, he was very polite, and I hoped to thank him. There are also lifeguards in the indoor pool! Thank you for always keeping us safe! Don't run, walk slowly! Don't run, walk slowly ❤️

The store knows that it is the child's birthday, so not only did the room decorate, but also gave the child an octopus doll and a blessing cake in the evening, which was a special surprise! The exterior of the entire hotel is still great. The beach is delicate and soft. The buffet is free for children under 1.4 meters. The whole hotel is very friendly to children.

msg:This year’s Chinese New Year coincided with the outbreak of the Shenzhen epidemic, and the original travel plans were all in vain. At the end of the winter vacation, the children strongly requested to go to the seaside, so this trip was made. This five-star hotel in Dameisha is just passing by but never made a special trip to stay. The children are looking forward to it. 40 minutes drive from home. Let’s spit out the underground parking lot first. Although the parking lot is huge, the smell is unpleasant. This part of the hotel should be paid attention to. The first impression of the stay is discounted. The epidemic prevention work is not bad, you need a health code itinerary code, and you need to sign a letter of commi**ent. The lobby should still be renovated and upgraded, surrounded by baffles, looking at the lobby is a little stingy. After checking in and entering the room, I found that there was still a door in the room, which should be one of the suites. The children said they didn't like this kind of room, so they called to apply for a room change. About five minutes later, the account manager called to understand the situation, and upgraded the high-floor room for free. The new room was very satisfied, which is very good. There is a return visit from the hotel customer service later. I had a buffet at the hotel for dinner. Because it was Valentine's Day, the restaurant also gave each guest a rose🌹. The restaurant service needs to be improved. The plate after eating could not be taken away in time, so I had to put it on the table next to me. . The staff of the swimming pool are still good, answer any questions, and go directly to the beach after swimming. The staff reminds the wind outside to wear bathrobes and bath towels. When I opened the door, I understood the staff's kind reminder, really It's so cold. To sum up this stay experience, for a five-star hotel, the service still has a lot of room for improvement, and the hardware details also need to be improved. I hope to have a better stay experience next time.

The breakfast is crowded and there are few varieties, and I have to wait in line at the door for the first time in so many years. . . Not recommended anyway.

msg:I couldn't go far due to the Corona situation, so I went on the weekend for vacation and for my children's birthday. It was really the worst place I've ever been. I don't know if they are employees or part-time workers for a short period of time, but there are many parts that I don't understand properly, so I had to explain it over and over again. I arrived early and waited because check-in was only possible at 3 o'clock, but at 3 o'clock, the computer server was down, and I stood there for an hour before checking in until 4 o'clock. I asked for a late check-out the next day and they said no. There was no hand wash or razor in the room, and the staff brought it to me after 3 calls for request, but another person brought it 20 minutes later. The air conditioner on the bunk bed side was noisy and not cool, and there were hairs on the pillows. The breakfast buffet was also not available, so I waited again. In the end, they said they would check and let me know, but the staff did not come until breakfast was finished. When we went and asked, it was only then that they told us that it was true that we had requested breakfast. There was no word of apology. The price is much higher than other InterContinental I stayed the night before, but the service was really bad. Was it just because there were so many guests? Please train your staff properly. It's a place I never want to go again.

I always thought that I would understand it during the peak check-in period. I checked in at 5:30 yesterday, and I ordered two rooms. The front desk asked me what kind of room I wanted. I said one double bed and one double bed. I was told that I could not be on the same floor. One is still being cleaned, I said that it would be fine to change to two double beds, but the same reason refused me, and finally I said that two twin beds are also fine, but I was told no, I was really speechless, and a combination was given to them There was no room. In the end, someone like a manager came, knocked on the computer a few times, said that there was another room, and then told the front desk to give it to them. Is it because of Ctrip orders, do you treat them differently? If you have a room, don't give it? The room is 3500 a night, and the room is still not clean after checking in at 5:30. Is it understandable?

msg:There is no problem with the environment and sanitation. For a hotel of more than 2,000 a night, no one will go if this is not done well! The front desk service is good, the restaurant is just average, when you arrive, you just tell you that there is no place, and the tone of your speech is not good. If you stop you from waiting at the door, the guests are embarrassed, okay? The overall facility is ok, but the snacks and drinks in the room are too expensive. The child opened a box of potato chips (about four or five dollars for a small box) and didn't eat it, and was deducted 58. Seriously, your whole fridge and bar stuff doesn't add up to $58! What's wrong with delivering some snacks in a room of more than 2,000 a night, you will lose money by delivering some food and drink? Besides, you are a parent-child hotel. Many children live in the hotel. You are suspected of misleading consumption by stacking snacks in the bar refrigerator. Does the child understand the price before disassembling it? Other high-end hotels either do not charge, or do not let go, send it by phone! And I use Ctrip to book a lot of hotels without paying a deposit. You can pay it as soon as you pay it. You have to pay 1,500 yuan, which is already more than 50% of the room rate. Is there no state regulation? And the speed of refunding the deposit is extremely slow! Not a good experience anyway.
My review may be a bit stricter, but you have to know the price of your hotel, and if you can get this price, you have to face such a strict review.

When I arrived at 3:30 in the afternoon, there was a queue for check-in, and there were six or seven families in front. This is normal. The key is the attitude of the check-in brother when we were in line: You said he was rude and bullied customers? He didn't say too much either; you said he was polite but his arrogant attitude and somehow superiority were unpleasant. It actually reminded me of the Starbucks clerk who forced Luo Yonghao to slap his mouth for the first time.

The next day, I went to OCT East and took a taxi for two kilometers.
On the third day, I went to the outlet opposite the hotel, which was quite cheap

🧹Hygienic: The hotel’s sanitation can be done at the upper level, but the quality of the hotel cleaning and sanitation staff is very good. It seems that the training is in place 👍

🍃Environment: Well-designed, especially suitable for those with children, almost all rooms have balconies


🔔Service: There is a children’s naughty castle on the first floor
              Swimming pool (indoors at 38℃ for small babies and adults’ rooms
Outside is the infinity pool)


🍖 Food: Breakfast is pretty good, I like sliced noodles the most. The ingredients are fresh
        Lunch: The lunch at the hotel is not good, expensive. The taste is so-so. I went to eat the five-grain aromatic pigeon later, which was very delicious.

        I ate the hotel buffet for dinner. The lobster, oysters, and salmon were fresh, and the desserts were also great. Saturdays were rich in ingredients and singers sang.


The front desk is also ok, the service is relatively in place, the front office manager is very responsible, and always greets back and forth asking if you need help, the three-day check-in trip ended perfectly, satisfied 👍

msg:I have always wanted to experience what Shenzhen’s most high-end executive club is like. Taking advantage of the off-season in eastern Shenzhen, I brought a 2-year-old baby to experience it. From the entrance of the parking lot, you can feel the aura of the administrative building. The high-end and simple style is a blockbuster taking pictures. The whole staying experience is very good. Few people enjoy the quietness. Whether it is the service or the hotel hardware, you can feel the hotel's intentions from the small details. For example, the sun loungers by the swimming pool will be equipped with sunscreen and drinking water for the guests, and the guests who are afraid of the cold and want to see the sea will be taken care of by the oven if they are afraid of the sea breeze. In the afternoon and evening, refreshments and fruit cakes are provided free of charge. Although there are not many types, they are refined, which is too friendly for me with a baby. The residents of the administrative building can use the facilities of the main building. The two hotels are very close to each other. It takes only a few minutes to walk. In contrast, the difference between the two floors is too great, the residents should not think about going to the main building haha. . I mainly took my baby to the main building to play the Bobo Pool and the small train. It is really too old. It would be perfect if the administration building could also add some children's entertainment equipment.

🧹Sanitation: In the hotel by the sea, the sanitation is very good, the housekeeping staff are also very polite, the room and the hotel do not smell the tide, this is rare, it is worthy of praise👍

🍃Environment: There is an exclusive beach coast next to the hotel, overlooking the ocean and villa area, the scenery is very beautiful.

They helped to deal with them in time. When they returned to the room, they received a call for condolences. Later, they asked about WeChat. He also proactively helped us extend the check-out time, satisfying my father’s desire to shop. Although there was a small mistake, the overall service is satisfactory. I am embarrassed to blame. Breakfast and dinner are also rich in drinks, which is great. There are also small hot pot, lobster, and I have given two more children to lobster. The restaurant manager has been asking everyone whether they are satisfied with the dishes. The best thing is that guests are always required to wear masks to pick up meals. This is very good. I hope more stringent requirements, after all, there are too many unconscious people. Overall the service is very good, I hope to continue to maintain, next time I go to see a more perfect Intercontinental

msg:I walked into InterContinental with a touch of blue, leaving memories of me growing up a year ago. I am so happy. Take advantage of my parents’ youth to take them to the beach and relax. Shenzhen Dameisha Jingji Intercontinental is a good place. s Choice. We booked a panoramic suite this time, and the sound of the sea can be heard from the 180-degree balcony.
🚗 Transportation: It is highly recommended that friends come to Shenzhen by car. If you are in Guangdong, we will drive from Foshan to the InterContinental Hotel in 2 and a half hours. The hotel also provides free parking for guests.

🍃Environment: From driving into the trail, I was attracted by the design of the hotel. It looks like a cruise ship up close and waves at a distance. The blue color makes people feel very healing. There is a private beach next to the hotel. We go to the swimming pool almost every day. Stay on the beach for a few hours, listen to the sound of the sea, look at the sea, it’s great.

🍴Restaurant: It’s a pity that its Italian restaurant was not open when we went, so let’s leave the regret for next time haha. But our favorite among other hotel restaurants is Weinan Pavilion. It is located in the InterContinental Executive Club. It is also very beautiful and quiet and suitable for couples or birthdays. The restaurant's service can be given 5 stars and the service is very considerate. In addition, we also tried the Royal Palace of Guangdong. My mother likes their bamboo noodles, which are quite distinctive haha.

🔔Service: First of all, I would like to give a big thank you to Robin Wang-the concierge manager. He was very enthusiastic and patient to help us solve the problem from the request of an extra bed to my stay, the recommendation of the restaurant, to the problem with the bathtub halfway through the room change, let us I feel the personalized service, very caring~ Thanks again to the restaurant manager of Weinan Pavilion and Leeya who served us. They have been paying attention to our dining situation, and they also sang to me to celebrate my birthday together, as if they were back home.

Although the hotel has been in business for a few years, the service makes us feel welcome, comfortable and happy. It is like returning home. The only opinion is that it would be more perfect if a well-equipped room was arranged at the beginning. In general, choose InterContinental Hotel is the right choice🥳🥳

The room is a bit discounted except for the sea view balcony. Up to three to four stars. The room size and facilities. A bottle of water and a little fruit in the evening is better than nothing! The breakfast is so-so average, but there are not many flavors, no delicacies! Hygiene is below the absolute standard, whether it is in the room or in the restaurant or coffee bar, the cups have visible coffee stains and other stains. Such sanitation in special times really affects the mood! The price of the restaurant is very touching. Of course, the locals in Shenzhen choose to eat around, a lot of food, just a waste of time.
Let’s talk about the advantages. The room has a good view, the private beach and the infinity pool are good, that is, the water in the pool should increase the water temperature in the 20-degree weather, but there is no, so there are only a few people swimming!

The outdoor swimming pool has beautiful scenery and is suitable for taking pictures. The waiter in the restaurant was also very good. They asked if they needed a mask. They offered fresh fruit juice and tuckahoe paste. The cantaloupe juice was delicious and the children liked it very much. The tuckahoe paste is recommended to have a lower sweetness. The lobby on the first floor has a beautiful environment and is very quiet at night. It is very suitable for a person to spend a daze quietly. All in all, the experience is very good. I look forward to seeing you next time!

When I first moved in, I made progress. The most important thing is the hotel’s private beach. The sand is fine and you won’t feel thorny when you step on it. There are lifeguards on different corners of the beach, so people can play with peace of mind. Fify, a beautiful employee, has helped arrange a room with a nice view in advance during the last few stays, and will follow up the needs during the whole process, making people truly feel at home.

msg:I am a bit disappointed when I enter the lobby. The decoration is a bit rustic and looks like a decade ago, but the newly built club area feels taller, with only 62 rooms, an exclusive swimming pool and a beach with fewer people and a higher sense of comfort; The external swimming pool of the main building of the hotel is 4000 square meters large and very Hawaiian. The seaside is clean and beautiful. There are various water projects. The water sofa is safer and more suitable for children and those who are afraid of excitement. People with a parachute above 60 kilograms can play, 580 per person. It feels a bit embarrassing for the two to charge double the fee together.
The hotel staff was very nice. The room was wrong when I first arrived. Although the room was tight, I was able to change to a satisfactory room. The room was well-equipped and had a balcony where I could dry my swimsuits.
There is a yacht club next to it, and friends who like to go out to sea can walk there and rent a boat very convenient.
That is, the check-out and invoicing speed is too slow, two or three people have to wait for a long time, and the business reception ability needs to be improved. Overall satisfaction, it is worth the family to take the baby to travel.

msg:This is the second time I came to Shenzhen Dameisha Jingji Intercontinental Resort. The first time I came at the end of August last year. At that time, I decided to take my children on vacation this summer. Happy 🥳! Unexpectedly, the two changes have changed a lot: all the room types have been upgraded, the grade has been upgraded to a higher level, and the rooms have been brand new! Not only the room facilities have been upgraded, but the service has also improved a lot. When checking in, Kate knew that the child’s birthday was immediately docked and arranged for the hotel to present a cake🎂, feeling at home, so thoughtful, and thoughtful in details. There are various activities for children in the room. The child really likes 💕 and is very happy. He told me this was his happiest day, and if he could stay for another day, I promised him to come again. Not far away, more than ten kilometers away, the transportation to the hotel is convenient and fast, the sanitation is super good, and the environment is beautiful. The best thing is that the service is so good. The staff in every part of the hotel will greet them politely. . There are evaluations from various fields in Shenzhen’s top ten parent-child hotels. It is currently ranked first in my eyes and in my heart☝️, not only the top sea view hotel, but the hotel closest to the sea, the sandy beach is vast and beautiful, sandy Delicate and clean; there are four swimming pools, the one in the middle is an infinity swimming pool, two are for children, one is a parent-child swimming pool, and there is an indoor swimming pool. The biggest is the fascinating and clear-cut. So beautiful. It's so suitable for a holiday, the view from the room and the balcony is superb, with the same sea and sky. There is also something to recommend to foodie friends: gourmet food, gourmet food, gourmet food! Our double breakfast and double night packages, apart from being cost-effective, are too delicious. When dining, they are: watching the stunning sea view, listening to wonderful music, eating all kinds of food...just go and play after you check in. : Swimming in the pool, picking snails by the beach, playing in the sand, watching children’s play time and playing children’s pool bubbles, water slides, water gun competition and other games; food buffet, sea eating and drinking, eyes, mouth and ears are not idle. Enjoy the triple feast of vision (fascinating sea view), hearing (scenario music), and taste (precious delicacies)...After the meal, guess lantern riddles to create Mid-Autumn Lanterns 🏮, return to the room table and put the hotel on the table as a gift of carefully prepared intercontinental brand moon cakes and Assorted fungus, children’s birthday cake. Wow, I don't just like this hotel now, I like this brand even more. No matter how good-looking I am, people may question it, and seeing it is better than hearing it, and you will know it when you go. Anyway, my money is worth it. This is not the first time I have come back, and it will definitely not be the last! Friends who need consultation can ask me questions at any time. Know everything without saying anything! 🥳🥳

Special thanks to the guest relations director Kate for his warm hospitality. I have time to bring children to come often on weekends 😀

I took a few pictures and my family was surprised: it turns out that there can be such a blue sky and white clouds + sea view in China! ! Comparable to all overseas island resorts visited in previous years! !

msg:Five-star hotel, but when I first came to check-in, I couldn't experience it at all. On Sundays after school started, the queue was for more than half an hour, and some people didn't finish it for more than ten minutes. I felt it was normal. The hardware facilities are okay. Two sticks of yogurt and a small turtle were given in the evening. The fruit delivered in the afternoon was a banana, apple, and pear. The big plate with three fruits in a five-star hotel always felt a bit stingy. Calling to get everything counted as normal speed and delivered. Basically, there are activities for children throughout the day, which interprets the concept of parent-child. I found out that the swimming pool was cleaned on Monday morning. I was wondering whether it was cleaning and changing the water every day, but the swimming pool in the middle was still being cleaned from 11 o'clock to 2 o'clock. I wonder if it is cleaned once a week. The breakfast buffet is okay. There are freshly made noodles, pancakes, muffins and other special things. Shrimp dumplings and siu mai money belly taste like a tea house. The rest is what a normal breakfast buffet should have. I also saw a kaleidoscope for children, freshly squeezed cantaloupe juice, and tortoiseshell syrup. Those who do not wear a mask will be provided with a mask to suggest you to wear it. The beach and the sea are unattended. The rooms are facing the sea. It would be better if the sensors on the roof could not use flashing lights to affect sleep.

It's strange! Everything else is fine. Another small suggestion is whether the glass door of the bathroom can be made frosted. This way, you don't have to go to the toilet alone, and other people can't use other equipment in the bathroom.

🔔Service: The waiter and the cleaning aunt can serve with a smile, which is good.

The beach is relatively clean compared to the public beach, the sand is also very fine, it is very comfortable to step on. The sea is clear, and you can see marine life like small fishes and crabs through the sea.

Suggestion: The hotel is divided into two buildings, the main building here has many swimming pool entertainment facilities, and comprehensive, suitable for a family holiday. There is also an administrative building, relatively quiet, with a small infinity pool upstairs, suitable for couples.

Disadvantages: There are many people in the hotel, you need to queue for check-in, which can last from ten minutes to an hour, and sometimes you have to queue for breakfast.

But the extra bed fee is too expensive, 500 yuan per night, without breakfast! ! The price is really above the five-star standard. In addition, there is one more thing that must be complained about. In early June, during the epidemic in Shenzhen, a discount of 1499 yuan for group purchases with 2 large and 2 small sea view rooms including breakfast and dinner was launched. As a result, after the group purchase, the hotel reservation process was not smooth at all. The listing was directly locked during the summer vacation, and the appoin**ent was full every day. Isn't this just for fun? If you feel that you are at a loss, you can lock the house, why go early!

When I went there, the baby was a bit sleepy, but the room was not cleaned. Lin Fangyi, the executive at the front desk, came over To serve us, I added WeChat and said to help me make urgent arrangements. After eating at the Cantonese Cuisine Wangfu, she informed me that a room is available, took the child to sleep, and had a good time going down. The hotel service is very good, Miss Lin In the afternoon, I took the initiative to ask me if I need a bed, there is a private beach, it is very convenient to play, and there is also a children’s playroom, which is a very good experience.

Advantages: The scenery is beautiful, the private beach is very good, the hotel's hardware, service, and catering are worthy of five-star praise;
Disadvantages: The check-in time during the holidays takes too long, and each year is later than the previous year. It really needs to be improved.
Special thanks to Zhang Xiaoying, the eldest sister of the room service during this stay. The hygiene is very good and the attitude is very good.

msg:There are a lot of people during summer vacation, so tell the hotel the time of arrival in advance, and you can get the room after check-in, otherwise you may have to wait.

The quality of the InterContinental brand is still guaranteed. The rooms in this hotel are all sea-view rooms.

The room is relatively large and has a terrace. The swimming pool is the favorite of children. There are three pools, which are relatively large. You can play in the afternoon because you just can't get the sun. The hotel's own beach, the sand is very fine, and it is very comfortable to walk slowly.

The parking lot has sufficient parking spaces and adequate epidemic prevention measures.

Although there are many people for breakfast, the arrangement is orderly and the food is replenished quickly.

msg:A great experience! I visited before when I was in the Sheraton. At that time, there were not so many amu*****t facilities. The main outdoor children's play was the swimming pool. Of course, the hotel’s private beach was as good as always, but after it was changed to Jingji Intercontinental, the services and facilities would be better. Outdoor There is a new water slide in the swimming pool, half an hour of bubble time every afternoon, and water cushion rides open on weekends, which are much more fun than before. The hotel staff are very polite and helped us upgrade our room for free when we checked in. Thank you Xiaogu applied for our child’s breakfast for free (my son is 1.38 meters tall, exceeding the child’s height as set by the hotel), and is very enthusiastic to serve him. The aunt who cleans the room on the 10th floor is also very good and keeps asking what we have Tell her if you need it. There are a lot of people at breakfast and dinner. The staff at the restaurant are very fortunate. They take the trouble to help customers solve problems and quickly clear the table. In short, adults and children have fun and don’t want to leave. Every summer, they will bring their children to live for a few days.

Maybe the epidemic is suddenly lifted, the hotel is full, and the two rooms are not on the same floor at first, which is more inconvenient. Special thanks to Miss Lark Lin. From the beginning of communicating our needs before departure, through the whole process, we have been very enthusiastic and actively contacted and finally helped us find a way to transfer to a floor. The hotel is still great in all aspects, infinity pool, rich breakfast , Warm and friendly staff, all kinds of fun facilities for parents and children....It is definitely the first choice for taking family parents and children to Dameisha for vacation!

msg:Advantages: 1. Spacious room and good view 2. Less people can swim on the beach

Disadvantages: 1. The check-in queue was four hours. After check-in, there was another queue to get the room card. It was not easy to queue up. It was said that the room was not cleaned (5 o'clock in the afternoon), so I had to leave and queue up again. The strange and unheard of process should be deliberately done by insufficient manpower.
2. When I booked the room, I said that the swimming pool can be used, but I went to the swimming pool on the far right on Monday and was kicked out, saying that this swimming pool is only open on weekends. Interestingly, the pool suddenly opened on Thursday because a "premium member" came and asked to use the pool. It turns out that the so-called policy is only for our ordinary guests. Then it's better to say it straight, don't lie.

3. On the last morning, we wanted to watch the sunrise on the beach at 5:30, but we were told that we could only go out to the beach at 6:00. Are we in jail? Can only enter and exit at specified times? Obviously it is a public beach, the hotel has the right to decide when guests can go.

4. The attitude of the service staff seems to be okay, but in fact most of them are perfunctory, not telling the truth and not really solving the problem, but it is probably no wonder they are the masters of Tai Chi with problems in the hotel management.

5. The breakfast is unsatisfactory. It seems that there are many varieties, but very few delicious ones.

After checking in, we were told that all the beautiful places we saw must be booked in a club room before you can enjoy it!
Don't know before booking hotel!
This hotel is actually divided into 2 buildings. One building is called the main building, which is worth more than 1,500 yuan per night. The hotel's lobby and public areas are no different from the hotel 10 years ago. The beach is also the public beach in Dameisha. The other building is the club's room. The public area of the club is fairly modern, but the service is poor! Very snobbish. The waiter's words inside and out are that only high-end customers are served here. All kinds of dragging are impossible! By the way, check-in at this hotel is after 3 o'clock and check-in is very slow! And check out before 12:00! Very not recommended!

酒店早餐也比較豐富，尤其是現做的油潑麪非常非常好吃，現場扯麪、煮、放調料再澆熱油，非常正宗，扯麪師傅也周到熱情。但週末人較多，用餐環境有些嘈雜，更建議平日過來。
另外户外沙灘、室內泳池救生員也很負責，會一直巡視並詢問是否會遊等。
美中不足是酒店前台培訓很不到位，在訂房前致電前台詢問主樓和行政樓配套和房型區別，被告知房間沒什麼區別，也沒有提到行政禮遇等。辦入住時，前台態度依舊不冷不熱，沒主動介紹酒店設施，例如室內泳池在哪、健身房幾點關閉、是否有娛樂活動等都是問一句答一句。

設施：房間和整個酒店的設施都對親子度假準備得非常周到。完全無障礙。小朋友需要用到的設施酒店都早早做好了準備。
適合小朋友玩的設施特別多。雖然入住當天下暴雨，但小朋友在室內項目仍然玩的不亦樂乎。


服務：各方面服務沒什麼可挑剔的。遇到的工作人員態度都非常好。

個人感覺唯一美中不足的是餐廳價格比兩年前漲了太多了，尤其是晚餐。晚餐菜品偏商務宴請。玩累了一家老小想點些清淡適口的晚餐的話有點子難。當然也可能是個人口味問題哈。

表揚Mona小姐姐（or妹妹），提前致電詢問需求，並早早就為我們準備好了需要用到的小童用品和大人需要的乳膠枕頭（離開合適的枕頭不能入睡星人）。房間裏還備了挖沙玩具和水果，非常周到貼心。

總體體驗感很棒，尤其適合帶孩子來玩。下次還來

msg:酒店知我嚟慶祝，有用玫瑰花花瓣同毛巾整特別佈置，仲送咗蛋糕，但前台話當日房間全滿，整理房間時間較長，最後我哋要遲咗45分鐘先有得攞房。我都有問如果唔冇特別佈置可唔可以早啲，但係前台話冇太大分別，所以我哋就食住下午茶咁等房喇。

下午茶同Happy Hour 雖然係免費，但以食物同野飲質素黎講，我寧願酒店唔好提供，超難食。
酒店裡面的餐廳，蔚藍閣，野食實在都令人留下深刻印象，因為超難食！我地2個人食左9百蚊，但野食都係超難食，粟米湯冇粟米味，個肉醬意粉仲難食過我自己頹煮……
另外好多「網紅」係到影相，而且霸佔一個位置勁長時間，仲要著住對鞋踩入泳池邊，酒店員工都無去協調一下，因為真係影響其他住客。
總括平日黎講，2千幾蚊一晚，可以有更好選擇，吾需要黎呢到……

缺點：服務一般，部分工作人員不靈活。響應不夠及時。有問題問前台説回電話一直沒回，最後自己解決。室內小童泳池水可臟了沒人管。室內泳池防滑墊不合理，娃不小心輕輕摔一下結果腿上被劃得全是口子。幸好泳池邊工作人員不錯，迅速消毒處理傷口。

特別感謝保潔師傅吳阿姨幫我們處理了衞生間的積水，細心照顧我們，會主動詢問是否需要其他幫助。
自助餐的服務員不行，我帶孩子去上廁所，離開餐桌前特意囑咐不要清理回來還要繼續吃，且放了私人物品在座位上。結果回來就發現盤子及食物均被清了，本來也沒啥，有點浪費食物。我們準備重新去拿，服務員説她看到臟死了就忍不住清了。頓時體驗非常糟，好像我們是很不講衞生的人？我不把娃的秋刀魚翅食物殘渣放桌上難道丟地下或者吃進去嗎？
房間比較舊，三晚8800+，特殊時期可以理解，但是設施及自助餐的服務沒有跟上，差強人意。衞生間的預防跌倒做的不夠，孩子洗完澡滑了一跤沒有受傷，酒店表示了關心。但是希望酒店引起重視，避免更多的長者或小童受傷。

要非常感謝Kelly管家的貼心服務，提前告知我們入住期間小童遊樂項目的時間和地點，第二天孩子的腳不小心劃破流血，立刻請服務人員送來碘伏和創口貼，讓我們感到非常暖心。下次來深圳還會選擇洲際行政俱樂部！

其次，當初選擇這家酒店最主要的原因是它擁有私人沙灘，沙質細膩，水質也算清澈，和外面的公共沙灘比沙子的腳感可好太多了，也不用去外面人擠人。

此外，洲際酒店的一貫水準，提供了各種豐富多彩的親子活動，我們住了三天，體驗了各種活動，小朋友玩的開心，大人也輕鬆。下次來深圳度假肯定還會選擇這裏的，強烈推薦。

樓下是酒店專屬沙灘，海景房觀景極佳。打開陽台玻璃門，聽海浪潮來潮去的聲音，看遠方的海島與海天一色。關上門，房間安靜舒適。
早餐的油潑麪，筋道好吃，十分推薦（麪師傅叮囑已調好的味道，無需添加其他澆頭，其實更為純粹好吃，親測果真如此。）
於有喝茶習慣的自己，房間設計十分友好。小細節提供大便利：沙發一側扶手位設計為小茶台，側面有插座，便於燒水泡茶。另外應需求，酒店還額外提供了份量充足的礦泉水供泡茶之需。
坐出租車時，師傅説大梅沙京基洲際度假酒店是鹽田最好的酒店。的確如此，愉悦舒適的入住體驗帶來美好回憶。

提前聯繫了酒店，告知這次來是給小朋友過生日，酒店送了免費的佈置和蛋糕（蛋糕給的那天我們白天出去玩了，很晚才回來，所以品相有點影響 不過味道還不錯）

每個遇到的服務員都很熱情地打招呼，早餐也不錯。
去了沙灘，酒店獨享的人很少，水有點涼不過踩踩還是很舒服的。入住的時候送了一套挖沙工具（個人建議，直接泳池登記房號租借就好了，送了挖沙工具其實最後也帶不走，這樣反而浪費了）
室內泳池也去了，可惜大泳池比較涼，小朋友適合邊上一個小小的圓形泳池戲水。

唯一有一些不滿意，是正好碰到不知道哪裡在施工，每天基本九點開始大堂就很明顯滋滋滋電鑽聲，好在客房聽不太明顯

趣趣島活動也豐富 兒子參加了個遍 小朋友很多氛圍都很不錯 他還能交朋友 一舉兩得 不喊他他能泡在裏面一天 私人沙灘 進沙灘會有工作人員看房卡🏖️所以很乾凈 沖腳方便
早餐的油潑麪是真好吃啊！
總體都不錯 是以後會來二刷的地方👍🏻

水上活動偏貴，但冇辦法，要襯托酒店的升級水平。
有少少美中不足是：每部電梯的扶手欄杆頭尾十分尖銳，剛剛剛好對準小朋友的頭部。希望酒店能加一些保護膠貼。

幸運泳池的大泳池水溫不夠暖。可以的話，把溫度調高少少。

msg:非常差的一次入住體驗，如果可以，我都想打負分。國內外同價位的酒店中，住過最差的，洲際從此拉黑。
平心而論，有一説一，有十説十。
訂的是行政俱樂部的海景房，為了的是入住體驗好點，但是這家酒店的管理真的很差，服務諸多不滿意的地方，最不滿意的就是前台。
1.去到店後前台是目前房很滿，衹有兩個房給你選，一個園景房，一個“有遮擋的海景房“。前台還帶着去看了這個“有遮擋的海景房“（見圖），這也算海景房？？一樓、窗外面就是餐廳連廊，早午晚都有人在那裡就餐、走動，連窗簾都不好意思打開，這不是赤裸裸的欺騙消費者嗎？反正我是不滿意，當我們説不滿意的時候，前台説你們可以改天再來，
Are you kidding me? 安排好日期、跑這麼遠去大梅沙，你真的覺得可以改天再來？
前台還多次説，想景觀好的話，我們很多客人都是訂的高層。我想問，11月大梅沙3000塊/晚的酒店，就衹配住這樣的房間？
而前台所説的那邊景觀好的房間，我們當晚在沙灘那邊看亮燈率，根本就沒兩三個房間亮燈。
房間沒安排對，這是最不滿意的。事後我選擇了投訴這家酒店。
2.酒店的管理給人的感覺很亂。2點多入住時説果盆待會就送到房間，結果快7點了，打電話過去催才送來。類似的事情，入住時打電話説有衣服需要熨燙，接線員説2個小時左右也就是晚上6點左右送回，結果呢，第二天我們快要退房了打電話問才送回。
3.在酒店裡點了外賣，外賣員衹能送到大門口的外賣台，這個我理解，但是你們工作人員不能給客人送一下到房間門口嗎？必須得客人走曲曲折折的路去到大門口拿，住出了快捷酒店的體驗。
4.房間裏有蚊子，半夜被蚊子咬醒，打了幾番蚊子，才打死。現在手上還有蚊子包。本來去住酒店就是為了享受一下，結果變成了去找苦吃。
5.退房當天中午，也就是週日中午，前台打電話來説退房的事情，我們説是會員，想延遲到1點退房。正常來説，這個時候前台有且衹有説好的，但是卻又來扯我們酒店預訂很慢、房間很緊張什麼的。這個説起來也是極其讓人不悦，你們房間緊張不緊張，關我們享受會員能延遲到2點退房有什麼關係？言下之意你是想趕我們走嗎？這都什麼辣雞管理。
6.退完房，我們兩袋行李，還有熨燙的衣服拿在手上，沒有一個工作人員給我們提，也沒有人幫忙開門，從大堂就這樣一直走到遠處的停車區，這麼多工作人員就這樣看着我們，呵呵。這樣的酒店值得3000塊一晚？？
另外，大家猜行政禮遇是什麼。當門鈴響起工作人員送來説給我們的禮遇的時候，説出來我都笑了————兩個一次性的發熱眼罩。
下午茶相當敷衍，唯一還算可以的是早餐，也衹有早餐那邊的工作人員服務還算不錯。
本來緊挨着沙灘得天獨厚的優勢，卻被這樣的管理、服務讓入住體驗大打折扣，甚至拉黑洲際這個牌子。

msg:酒店整體是可以的，但以一間5星級國際大酒店而言，真的有一點點失望。
1. 酒店環境: 很好、風景和景觀也很好，他們的沙灘很乾淨，沙也很幼細。
2. 酒店的安排也很貼心，訂房時用電郵聯絡酒店，説當日有一位朋友生日，酒店便送了一個蛋糕和於朋友房間作了小量裝飾，真的很貼心。
3. 房間方便有少少不足之處，首先當進入房間的第一刻，看到房間內的玻璃上，有很多手指印。其次就是沖涼的地方去水速度比較慢，起初以為是有毛髮阻擋，但後來發現原來不是毛髮阻擋去水，而且去水速度真的有點慢。
4. 餐廳的服務: 晚上於酒店餐廳享用自助餐，食物質素￼一般般，但服務真的很差，首先枱面食完食物的盤碟，一直沒有服務員收拾，每次都需要叫服務員才來收拾。其次亦是最可笑的，吃￼蟹時問及服務員有沒有吃蟹的鉗子或剪刀，服務員說沒有，我們問他蟹殼這麼硬怎麼才能吃，他說用牙咬，我們聽到這話真的被嚇倒了，結果這晚我們只取了一次蟹吃就不取了，因為真的不知道怎樣才能吃，沒理由把所有的蟹鉗也弄掉不吃吧，太浪費了，所以唯有選擇不取好了。
但到早上到同一餐廳吃自助早餐時，早上的服務員與晚餐的態度完全180度不同，收餐碟的速度快，態度好、笑容好、服務到位，這才是5星酒店的服務態度，晚上的只能用一字形容，就是 “差”。
這是我的真實對酒店的評價，亦希望該酒店有待改善，能真的達到國際5星級酒店的服務態度。

在紀念品商店買了東西，但因為前台登記錯訊息，不能扣房間按金，最後付了現金。小小的跟前台反饋了一下，前台居然説，紀念品商店是外包，不能扣房間按金很正常。但其實紀念品商店是可以用房間按金的，衹是前台登記錯了我房間的名字。後續再次跟前台反饋，前台居然安排紀念品商店的人回電話道歉。剛説完人家是外包，轉頭就讓外包給客人道歉？
其次入住期間熱水不穩定，跟前台反饋希望維修不希望換房，最終是否維修，維修是什麼結果，完全沒有人理會。到退房那天早晨洗手盆出熱水還是20秒以上。
房間出現了問題，去前台詢問，前台的態度非常冷漠，來來去去反覆説，你去跟第三方問問吧。攜程的預訂就不是你們的客人麼？所以攜程上説客評説的什麼管家致電、跟進行程、體驗良好，為什麼我們房間完全被忽略沒有體驗到？從訂到住到走，打電話和麪對面的前台的服務體驗都非常差，讓人失望，也跟這個品牌不匹配。
餐廳和禮賓反而很亮眼。房間設施和景觀都不錯。這個價格衹能説買的是景觀和私人沙灘，服務就不要想了。
雖然來了很多次，但是希望下次想回來大梅沙洲際的時候，還是自己把自己勸退吧。

酒店有很多兒童嘅工作坊，也有免費的旅拍，有個小型嘅兒童波波池，自助早餐也很豐富。

唯一可以改善嘅就係，平日等房也需要很長時間，不過佢哋會比房卡你去玩其他設施，也頗為靈活。

酒店比較小，客房很多，下面就是泳池+私人沙灘，但其實沒有什麼綠化。取毛巾不方便，要進裏面才能取，這樣小朋友進去吹了空調就冷到了。
早餐晚餐可以吃的東西不多。
最後説一下很不滿意的一條，我的衣服忘記在酒店了，通常以前的酒店都是查房後直接聯繫我的，但是這個酒店基本在幾個小時之後都沒有聯繫我，在我詢問之後，才説去找我遺失在房間的衣服？？？你們不及時打掃？幾個小時了？
還有一點是按金，我們在酒店的消費在我退房的時候都沒有給我核對，出酒店24小時左右才給我退款，我還要自己算算金額對不對？？沒有明細清單。
酒店旅拍特別敷衍，敷衍的我都不想談了。。。既然這樣就不要學三亞旅拍了。

酒店的客服服務Bella十分細緻，事前會主動打電話比我同加我微信幫我安排一切。服務非常好！入住期間都不時幫忙，亦好快覆機，好efficient。Bella可算是我體驗過其中一個最好的客服，十分感謝Bella給予我一個美好的客服體驗！

這裏特別要提下和我一直對接的我的Fify，我們相識在幾年前我自己去度假的時候，後續基本入住都有諮詢他一些事情，很細心耐心，酒店本身不會有太大太大的差距，更多讓人舒服的是服務，他從入住到走都會無微不至的去關注你，真的人來到這裡有家的感覺，其他的工作人員也非常熱情，細緻，這次入住非常滿意，洲際值得你相信

以下幾點小攻略供參考
1、交通：自駕或者地鐵轉公交都可，我們是深圳站過來，滴滴很方便
2、房間：定的是雙床，人多的話，可以提前告知幫忙拼在一起，睡兩大一小空間很寬敞，房間的小沙發可以再睡一人
3、親子：提前告知有小朋友入住，有準備小朋友禮物（小公仔和挖沙工具），有提供小童浴袍、洗漱用品，有親子活動，部分需要預約
4、入住與退房：官方通知3點後入住，因為是淡季，一到就有房間，比較開心；退房時，開通了洲際的會員，可以延遲到下午2點，時間更充裕
5、餐飲：訂房自帶了早餐與晚餐，圖個省事，晚餐還行，早餐總類相對較少

住的時間是蘇拉來的前兩天，沒啥太陽，因此不會很曬。房間可以看見很美很美的景色！旁邊是鹽田港，裝着滿滿的集裝箱的貨輪經常能從眼前的海經過，從這裏出發去到世界各地，感覺很奇妙！哈哈！

msg:行政俱樂部和主樓都住了，俱樂部是用洲際官方訂的，主樓是攜程訂的。講道理，行政俱樂部果然是ccd的作品，美感在線，房少人少，精緻，近海，理論上適合避世。但可惜德不配位，隨時有可能破壞你的度假心情，謹慎選擇～提醒到此～
1，行政俱樂部住了一晚，因為愛它的視野和海的距離，續住。被要求按中午12點退房制度退出原房間，等待他們打掃好新房間再住，然後還説正常3點才是入住時間……
2，早餐選了視野好的桌放了房卡，放了喝了一口的咖啡，以識別自己已經入座，拿完東西回來，桌子不但被人坐了，還看到別人喝了我的咖啡……馬上叫服務員反映，他們讓我選個別的桌……結果需要我自己堅持，過去把別人請走。
3，房間叫水，2個半小時沒人送，又要自己去追。換了房，新房間就在原房間隔壁，尷尬地遺漏了內衣在陽台，電話服務員讓其取回，結果又50分鐘沒人理，最後是自己等在門口，讓路過的清潔阿姨幫忙開門取回。
4，針對上述種種，經理一句暑期人多請理解，完事。送個酒店廉價贈品被我拒絕，再沒有補救方案。我要求續住基礎房型，幫我升級房間彌補被破壞的度假心情，被摳搜的經理拒絕，再次強調他們很忙，讓我去住洲際主樓（非俱樂部房型）。美其言升級主樓房間，一來我本來就是喜歡俱樂部，不喜歡人多，根本沒有意願住主樓，二來看價格都知道，主樓比俱樂部便宜，這等於降級。
5，暑期俱樂部房間基本上比閑時貴2000+，而且還要做好心理準備，他們沒人服務你，這樣的俱樂部值不值，見仁見智。我觀察了一下，他們的服務員普遍年紀看上去很小，手腳真的非常生疏，餐廳的服務員問什麼都不清楚，跟我説她是新來的。也許洲際集團本身是有品質在的，但國內的運營方就不敢恭維了。簡單如在酒店公共空間走動時，俱樂部那邊的服務員就算在他們面前走過，都好像沒看到你一樣，一聲不吭。反而主樓，每次我遇到清潔阿姨，她都大聲跟我説早上好。
6，俱樂部雖然對比主樓人少，但現在也有巨多家庭客住，小孩到處跑，呱呱叫，商務或者想避親子風度假的朋友，也需要慎選。
7，主樓那邊超級大，隨之而來的就是人山人海，入住退房排隊，早餐排隊，泳池下餃子是常態，沙灘也密密麻麻。

再次感謝管家Kelly的服務～依舊貼心！去年房間裏沒有放刮鬍刀，走的時候提了一嘴，今年來的時候，Kelly已經記住並且提前放在房間了。實在太棒的服務了～
帶小朋友去的話感覺行政俱樂部確實很適合，人少點，因為樓層都比較低，所以去泳池和海灘都很方便。還有下午茶和歡樂時光很多可以吃的～
早餐在蔚藍閣，如果去的時間剛好不湊巧，可能就要坐室外了，因為室內位置不多。食物種類還算豐富，小孩也有很多吃的選擇。
確實是很適合帶娃的親子酒店～當然也適合情侶度假，相對於更遠的海邊，從市區過來也很近。
以後有空再來～

酒店管理比不上喜來登的時候，很多不是住店的客人都可以隨便到泳池沙灘上，導致人滿為患，跟大梅沙公共海灘區別不大，花將近五千一晚住這個酒店就是衝著私人海灘去的，有點失望，希望酒店方能改進這方面的管理，比如刷卡才能進入之類。家庭親子房除了大點，多個雙人床和玩具，服務方面並沒有什麼特殊，感覺這個價格我住兩間豪華房豈不是更香？自助早餐9點多就要大排長龍，難以置信，體驗比較差。

粵菜王府服務很好，菜品也對得起那個價格。
