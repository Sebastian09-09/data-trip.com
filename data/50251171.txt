msg:Very nice resort, especially if you travel during off peak season. The resort has its own lake and countless water activities, onsens, water sports etc etc, both indoor and outdoor. Most stuff are very friendly, special thanks to our butler Lisa, also restaurant manager Mr. Li. Both have been very helpful.

We stayed in a tree house, the amenities are new, kids enjoy their stays there a lot. It comes with slide from 2nd floor down, also a climbing net in the house. We saw some bigger tree house with one even has a carousel‚Ä¶ amazing.

We tried a short helicopter trip too, with reasonable price. Quite fun.

Some areas to improve, although they have villas and tree houses, the privacy isn‚Äôt quite there. You will still see and be seen by your neighbours for example when using private onsen. Not a big problem for us though.

Overall very good experience, we plan to come back again. With so many activities, 2 nights are really too short. 3-5 nights you won't get bored here.

msg:The main selling point of this hotel is its water park, yet more than half of it was out of service (that said it's because of winter but I went there in April, the weather is pretty warm already in Guangzhou). The place has so much potential, but it's letting customers down by not providing the promised service. Additionally, during the three days I spent there, the main swimming pool was also out of service, with no explanation given.

The hotel's location is far from everything, so there aren't many restaurant options nearby. Guests have to rely on the two restaurants inside the hotel, one Chinese and one supposedly Western. However, the so-called Western restaurant is essentially an extension of the Chinese restaurant, offering only Chinese cuisine. They didn't even have basic Western items like sandwiches, pizza, or hamburgers.

Furthermore, both restaurants closed at 9 pm, and there's no 24-hour room service available. If you didn't eat before 9 pm, you would have to wait until the next day or try the vending machine, which was also broken or out of service on my second day there.

Overall, it was an expensive and disappointing experience. I probably won't be back.

When trying to find some of the amenities in the hotel, such as the SPA, the employees didn‚Äôt even know where it was! We asked three people for help and they told us they didnt know where it was. In addition, there was no information available anywhere about services offered. 

Breakfast was a terrible experience. The hotel was no ready for the number of people it hosted, we arrived at the restaurant for breakfast and were sent to a back room, which had been temporarily used to accommodate more people, the food was far away and it felt like third class service. 

If you have other options, dont go here. We rented one of the most expensive rooms, and it was totally not worth it. We were planning ro stay two nights but returned quickly after the first night.

msg:I have come to Forest Sea many times because my children like it. Unfortunately, the weather was not good this time. In order to avoid traffic jams during the five-day May Day holiday, I chose to travel on the 3rd day in the middle. Since there was only less than a week left before the holiday, the room type I liked was no longer available. I came several times to experience different room types. I have stayed in the villa area and the main building. The accommodation is generally okay. The facilities are relatively new. I personally prefer the main building. My children like tree houses and other specific themes. The main building is quiet and not so noisy. In addition, there are many people during the Golden Week, and the price is generally tripled. For the sake of children's fun, I basically bite the bullet and come. In fact, the service during the Golden Week is basically not up to par, and the experience in all aspects will be very poor. I basically understand it in my heart. This time, when I entered the room, I found that even the ordinary bath towel was wet. Has the cleaning been changed? It feels like a wet towel on the ground. I can't help but complain about the hair dryer. It's not common to find such poor quality hair dryers in hotels in and outside the province. The wind is not strong, and the sound is ho**** and it feels like it's going to break. This thing shouldn't be that expensive. You can buy a good domestic brand for 100 to 200 yuan. The quality is really poor. It takes a long time to blow. This is the first time I live on the fifth floor of the main building after many visits. I basically stayed on the third floor in the past. This time it was right in the corner. There is a small swimming pool outside the roof and a small spacious balcony where you can enjoy the waterfall in the distance. It's good, except that the cleaning is not kept up and there are many people. The basic facilities are open to the public and it is quite crowded. It was rainy season and the outdoor temperature was low (20-24 degrees), so we basically didn't play any activities. We had seen fireworks many times and had no interest in them. This time we played in the hotel's indoor swimming pool and hot spring pool for two hours. There were too many people, and both adults and children sneezed and had runny noses. Basically, except for children, adults didn't want to go in the water. It rained heavily halfway in the hot spring pool. It felt great to soak in the hot spring while being caught in the rain. The rest of the time we played in the small pool indoors. This experience was worse than the previous time, but it was also expected!

Weekend room rates are high, but if you want to balance children's play and accommodation experience, Forest Sea is still a perfect match for this important day. The hotel's overall one-stop service of eating, drinking and playing is not enough, but the housekeeper Lisa provided considerate service throughout the whole process and solved several problems that must affect satisfaction. This is the importance of service. Thank you housekeeper Lisa, see you next time at Forest Sea.

msg:The child's birthday was arranged to be celebrated in Forest Sea. I called in advance to help with the decoration. Although the decoration was simple, the child was still very happy to see it; in addition, it was very considerate to send cakes and welcome fruits, which was very touching.
The villa king-size bed room was booked on the 3rd floor. Although it was not directly connected to the swimming lane, it had two large soaking pools, and the space was also very large and comfortable.
I have to say that it is very suitable for strolling with children. There are many recreational facilities in the entire park. You can play in the water park during the day and soak in the hot springs at night to relieve a day's fatigue. It's so comfortable! Two days and one night don't feel enough! When leaving, the child was reluctant to leave and specified that he would come again next time.
In addition, I would like to thank the housekeeper Ajun. He is very kind and has a super good service attitude. He always attaches various play reminders without getting tired of it. This is very worthy of praise.
Overall, I was very satisfied with the two-day itinerary. I returned the key card early when I checked out at noon. The child wanted to go into the park again. Although he could enter by face recognition, he had to rent a locker at his own expense of 35 yuan. I personally feel that this is not very friendly to hotel guests. It would be better if it could be improved to enhance the experience!

However, compared with last year, you need to tell the room service depar**ent to deliver the bathrobe. Towels in the hot spring area also need to be claimed at the entrance.
Facilities: The water park has constant temperature water, but there are height or weight restrictions for children. But the artificial wave pool and topics are also very popular with children. Adults can also play on the slides on the 2nd and 3rd floors.
Service: I came to Forest Sea again, and the housekeeper Nicole provided good service. She will actively provide help and reminders. The staff in the park are still enthusiastic.
Hygiene: The overall room hygiene is OK. However, there are many flying ants recently, so you should pay attention to protection. If possible, it is recommended to provide more toiletries.
In general, I have been here in the peak season and the off-season. The children played on the ceiling.

As a result, from the lobby reception to the villa housekeeper Xiao Wen, the garage security personnel and the villa cleaning aunt, every staff member I met had a very good service attitude. The warm and thoughtful service really made people feel happy, which was completely different from what was said on the Internet. I was also quite satisfied with the food.

The room is clean and sanitary, with an independent pool suitable for children to play in the water in the room. However, because the water park is already large and well-equipped, the room pool is only used before going to bed. The room includes two days of playing in the water, one ticket for all, there are water parks and hot springs, white sand beaches, kayaks, electric boats, enough to play for a whole day. Although it was still drizzling, the indoor water world was warm water, which was very comfortable to play. It is worth visiting again on non-holidays in the future [snickering]

After learning that we were here to celebrate the child‚Äôs birthday, she also sent us a birthday cake. The cake was delicious. If you have any questions, you can contact the dedicated customer service at any time. Although there was a heavy rainstorm, the lake and water park were open, and there were fewer people than when the weather was good. The scenery in the rain was also different. The room service and play experience are definitely worth repurchasing many times. If there is a place that needs to be improved, it is the buffet restaurant. However, there are probably many farmhouse restaurants, and there are many choices if you don‚Äôt mind the trouble.

msg:Disadvantage one:
ÔøºTheir hotel uses large outdoor water facilities to attract guests, but on that day all large outdoor water facilities were closed on weekdays. Only the so-called hot springs, children's indoor water park (personally think it is only suitable for people under 10 years old), and artificial beaches were opened. And Ôøºinfinity swimming pool, rowing boat. The number of hot spring pools is very small and may not be enough if more guests are received. Ôøº

It is recommended that before you go, you must ask whether all the hotel's facilities are open, because I asked their manager in person, and they may not have enough manpower to open all large facilities. From now on, they may only open two or three groups a day. Ôøº

But don‚Äôt forget, I paid HK$1,500 for a one-night stay, but I didn‚Äôt get to use any facilities. This is not fair to customers at all. They use this selling point to attract customers so that they can charge such high prices. In the end, they can't do anything.

Disadvantage two:
There were actually not many guests on that weekday, and not many people checked in. I knew that check-out was at 12 o'clock, so I called three times to urge us to check out, and also sent staff to knock on the door twice. It was only 12:45. Their charges are the highest in Paitan Town, Zengcheng District, but I can't get the corresponding service, to be honest. We lived on the 3rd floor of the villa area, and there was no one to help carry our luggage during check-in and check-out. Then I checked into the Jiahua Hotel next to them, and I felt their enthusiasm for service and love for the company, which was admirable and appreciated. I paid 800 yuan for two people to stay at the Jiahua Hotel for one night including breakfast, which was cheaper than them, but I felt that they (Jiahua Hotel) took their guests seriously.

The food and beverages at Forest Sea are pretty average, neither too bad nor too good.

The housekeeper Ajun is responsive. We stayed in different room types for two nights and changed rooms in the middle. My child was uncomfortable and wanted to go back to the room. It was raining heavily and I couldn't walk. The housekeeper came to drive the battery car to take us back, and also packed the food from the restaurant and sent it to the room. It was very considerate.
The only drawback is that the toilet on the first floor of the room leaked a little. The floor was always wet, but it leaked very slowly. We didn't want to change rooms, so we didn't report it. We just put a few more floor mats to prevent children from slipping in the toilet in the middle of the night. It is recommended to check carefully every time you clean.

msg:It is really a wise choice to check in during off-peak hours, and I am generally very satisfied. The housekeeper Xiao Pan is very responsible and responds quickly. There are a small number of charging piles on the ground of the hotel. Although charging is very slow, it is enough for one night's stay. Check-in was at off-peak hours, so there was no queue and it was quick. The room card is in the form of a bracelet, and the bracelet is also used to insert the card into the room to draw power, which is very interesting. Most of the guest rooms are in the main building, as is the hotel lobby. After getting the bracelet, you have to take a battery car to go to the villa area and tree house area, otherwise it will be a bit far to carry your luggage by yourself. There is indeed a reason why Flower Castle is so popular. The independent villa has a large bed and a small bed on the first floor, and a duplex on the second floor with a large bed and a small bed. The queen bed is actually very big, more than enough for two persons, one large and one small. It said it was for 6 people, but it felt like it would be okay for 8 people. The children already had a lot of fun playing on the slide and in the pool in the yard. The castle faces the lake, right by the lake. It's very comfortable and the scenery is good. The air conditioner in the room is of a brand I have never seen before, and the cooling effect is particularly good. The shower gel is from L'Occitane and smells great. Although many facilities in the outdoor water park are not open now, the indoor water park, pedal boats, hand boats, and beaches on the lake are enough for young children to play for two days and one night. It may be a bit more troublesome to eat, as other restaurants are some distance away, and the buffet in the main building requires a battery car and a reservation. The room meal delivery service is off-peak and will not be delivered between 17:00 and 20:00. Later we walked to the Jungle Restaurant to eat fried rice noodles. The price was reasonable and the taste was good. Waiting for the second brush in the summer, I feel that the elderly, teenagers and children can have fun. It is recommended that you bring more snacks and instant noodles. Children will be hungry when they say they are hungry, so eating is not convenient.

After having a buffet dinner in the evening, we also participated in a bonfire party on the large lawn. Although it was relatively short, both adults and children were very happy. After breakfast the next day, we went to the indoor water park. There were not many people in the morning and it was a good experience.

Other than that, everything is perfect. The room is a two-story building that children like very much. You can go up along the climbing rope. The beach in the hotel is also very clean and fine. When it comes to cooling down, the children can't help but play for a long time. The swimming pool and hot spring are working well. The staff is also very reassuring. There are lifeguards everywhere. I will go again in the summer.

RV house: enough accommodation for 4 people, with butler service in place. The hardware facilities meet the needs of guests. Each room has an open-air bath with its own first-class hot spring water. Some of them have been repaired and improved. The starry sky sky paper electric blackout curtains are difficult to open and close, the blackout paper curtains are damaged, the bathroom door handle has fallen off, and the USB charging point of the electric plug has insufficient voltage. I hope to change the parking space to one in front of each person's door. The current parking space requires walking. Come, hope to achieve 100 points of satisfaction.
The quality of the breakfast is first-rate, the variety of food is sufficient and delicious, the restaurant environment is comfortable and the seats are sufficient.
The activities included in the package are real hot spring water, man-made beach, lakeside swimming pool, indoor temperature-controlled children's water park, outdoor water park, zoo, fish feeding, bumper boats, boating... just to name a few activities. You can play it all year round.
The benefits are endless, fun and joyful......
There is a street of farmhouse restaurants outside the hotel, with dozens of farmhouse restaurants for you to choose from.

The worst part of this experience was being informed at 6:00 that the buffet restaurant was full (thanks to the housekeeper who came to help register and queue up). At 7:05, the children were really hungry, so the whole family went to the door of the restaurant. There were obviously empty seats, but the waiter didn‚Äôt know. Insisting that only guests with single room packages for dinner are allowed to enter, and our guests with additional purchases must wait for another half an hour. There is no room for negotiation. The communication was fruitless and the only solution was to turn left to the Chinese restaurant. The adults don't care, but the poor child is hungry and has been waiting for a long time but is disappointed. The quality of the breakfast buffet the next morning was also lower than before.

The facilities in the room are not very complete. The attic of parent -child rooms is very stuffy, and this needs to be further rectified. Here I also give a small suggestion to the hotel. For guests who come to sign in early, you can draw on the practice of other parent -child hotels: first help the guests check in, deliver the door key, and then tell the guests to sort the text message notification after the room; To communicate with each other, communicate in time, and the check -up office can also help the guests of the Check in inquiries. This can effectively avoid the heavy and repeated workload of the front desk, and it can also stabilize the guests to generate anxiety. After all, there are elderly children and children who come to vacation. The car that took a few hours was quite tired. At least I knew when there was a room to avoid trouble in many things.

When you have just finished drinking the water, the staff will reach out to take it and help you throw it away [strong ], the staff answered questions in detail.

3. The environment is beautiful, the facilities are very clean, and the toilets in the public areas are cleaner than those in five-star hotels.

After all, I want to take a monthly subscription here in the summer!
5. There are many types of rooms, including study rooms, RVs, villas, and various parent-child rooms. I want to live in every one of them! You can also set up a barbecue at the RV campground!
6. The food is fresh and has many varieties, similar to the buffet at Jiahua Hotel.
7. Even if the room is full, no one will follow the crowd. The lake is spring water, crystal clear and beautiful.
8. The surrounding farms are delicious!
9. This journey is really fun, satisfying, and satisfying both physically and mentally!

After the butler adds WeChat, he will be reminded of different matters regularly, making it very convenient to play different projects based on the reminder.
The children loved the starry sky themed room booked this timeüíï and kept interacting in the room.
The tickets included in the room allow unlimited travel for two days, which is very convenient for guests.
On the first day, I mainly soaked in hot springs and played in the indoor amusement park.
The next day was sunny and warm, so we mainly went to the pier for a cruise and played on the beach. The lake is clear, the surrounding scenery is beautiful, and you can even see Baishui Village in the distance.

But the water park is actually one of the projects in the hot spring area. There are rafting, artificial waves, and water slides for children to play.
Service: The hotel service is very good, whether it is the front desk, hot spring or restaurant staff, they are very nice ~ I got lost when I walked to the parking lot, and the service guy took the initiative to ask if he needed help. The hotel also has a butler service. The butler Arjun feels like he is online at any time and even teaches us when to play and what to do~
Hygiene: The hotel hygiene is also very good, the restaurant is also very clean, the breakfast and evening buffets are good, and welcome fruits are given in the room~
Facilities: The one drawback of the room is that the hot spring pool in the room does not have an automatic drain. If the water is too full or if you want to heat the water after soaking for a long time, the water will easily overflow.

This time, the room rate also included a boat ride, and the water was very clean, which is really rare! ! ! The overall feeling is very good. I sat on the other side and took my children to play with the recreational facilities. Many of them are not open yet. Look at those that should be open in the summer, including many water facilities for summer fun. This is a great place for family travel. However, it will be more expensive to go on weekends. If you have time, it is more cost-effective to go during the week! Next time I'll try the tree house, which seems to be where elves live. That room type will be more expensive than living in a building. If you want value for money, choose to live in this building. The view of the lake and mountains is also very good. But that day I went to the indoor children's amu*****t facility, the one with the wave pool. I felt that the hot spring pools inside were not that clean and the water was not as good as those in the park. I also reported this matter to the front desk, hoping to improve it.
Overall, it‚Äôs worth coming! Especially friends who have never been here.

msg:When it‚Äôs my first time to go to a hot spring in China, my first choice is to have fun with the family and have a private hot spring option! There were many recommendations on the rankings, including B&Bs, but with a family, I was really afraid of stepping on the wrong side of things. In the end, I decided on Forest Sea. Not only did it not disappoint, it was much better than expected. Got it!

First of all, there are so many room types to choose from. Considering that the weather is getting colder, I chose a three-bedroom hot spring villa with a climbing slide! When checking in, the front desk staff arranged for our personal butler Ai Jun. After adding WeChat, he was completely responsive to all requestsüíØ! I couldn't order a cake for my little daughter's birthday in Conghua, so I mentioned it to Ai Jun, and he immediately arranged for the hotel chef to make a cake for her immediately. Little daughter,! The best part is that it tastes so delicious üòÇ Not only did he recommend the itinerary along the way, but he also helped confirm the delivery time of the room meal service! Even after checking out, my daughter forgot something and the housekeeper helped us deliver it backü§£ The bamboo tube dish she introduced us to eat after checking out was also great. My picky eater ate a lot of it.

It‚Äôs really a good time to go at this time in November. There won‚Äôt be too many people. The outdoor public hot spring area is so fun and comfortable to soak in. There are so many flower pools. We did the opposite and went to soak in it while everyone was having dinner, so it was basically a reserved area! The children all had a great time, and they were so hot that they didn‚Äôt feel cold at all! In the evening, the two parents-in-law took a quiet bath in the open-air hot spring on the third floor. There was really only two cups leftüç∑üòÜ. After breakfast the next morning, the children went crazy playing in the hot spring pool on the first and second floors, sneaked from the second floor to the first floor, took a dip, and climbed again Use the net rope to go up to the second floor, and after playing in the private bath in the room, go to the indoor heated water park and take pictures on the beach! They are all discharge activitiesüòÜ

Thank you Forest Sea for giving us such a good first domestic hot spring bathing experience. The whole thing was very good, from the hardware to the hot spring pool, (the bed is very hard and soft, and the shower water pressure is strong!) Although it is hard for my husband to travel from Hong Kong It‚Äôs hard to drive up here, but it‚Äôs really worth it. If you have the chance, you‚Äôll want to take your grandparents with you to the hot springs. It‚Äôs highly recommended!

The lake water in the scenic area is clear. You can go on a boat trip. The only drawback is that there are too many people at the breakfast buffet and I can't find a seat.

2,500 a night in a family hotel with a slide in the jungle. The room is very old. There are only two toothbrushes for three people. The service is very poor. There are few hot springs. There are only a few flower ponds and there are only a few indoor playgrounds for children. There are a slide and a fake wave, as well as pedal boats on the lake and an artificial beach. You should play more in summer. The buffet is super terrible and the food is not fresh. It is definitely not a second-rate place.

The food in the restaurant was also very good. The lunch portion at Elegant Restaurant is really big, and the waiters are very enthusiastic and introduce the dishes. Not impatient.
The room is so big that a family of four can live comfortably. I mainly booked this room type so that my sister could have a slide in the room.
Indoor hot springs, tea and towels are fully provided, the staff can basically be seen, there are sufficient lifeguards, and there are many hot spring pools, all of which are very good.
The park is very big and you can really spend a few days there. Next time I plan to come in summer.

I played with all the boats and drove the excavator for a long time. There are also water slides, wave pools, feeding small animals, and catching fish and shrimps. Come again next time!

msg:Facilities: The child is less than 1.2 meters tall, so I didn‚Äôt choose the parent-child suite. I booked a room in the villa area. The room was quite large and had a balcony and a separate swimming pool. However, there is no elevator on the second floor, so it is inconvenient to bring two children and a stroller.

Cleanliness: The room is clean and tidy.

Environment: Garden-style hotel with many types of trees, very pleasant to walk on. Unfortunately, there are construction and road closures everywhere during the off-season, which greatly reduces the experience. The sound insulation is not very good, you can hear the sounds of children next door and playing mahjong, but it is very quiet at night when everyone is asleep.

Service: The WeChat housekeepers and waiters are very considerate, answer all questions, and also help with luggage. All requests for bed rails, children's slippers and cotton slippers can be met. When checking out, the boy offered to hand over wristbands and drove us directly to the parking lot in a battery car. Thumbs up. Panda dolls were also given as afternoon tea, which the children loved very much.

Entertainment: Because it is the off-season and the temperature is cooling down, there are few people in the infinity pool and beach, so you can have a lot of fun. There are also 38-40‚ÑÉ soaking pools next to each large pool. If you feel cold, go there and take a dip. It is not easy to catch a cold. The hot spring is a bathing pool with various medicinal effects, and it is very comfortable to soak in it at night. The water quality of Tianyang Lake is very good, I saw a lot of fish, and the cruise is free. I wanted to choose a pedal boat with my baby, but when I heard tourists saying that their feet were weak when they docked, I decided to switch to the electric boat driven by the staff and go around the lake. Very cool.

Catering: The package I bought included a buffet dinner. I didn‚Äôt expect so many people. When I went there at 6:30, I could only find the wind outlet. I really recommend eating after 7 o'clock. The salmon sashimi is very fresh, and there is a long queue for the charcoal grilled oysters. The supply of meat is low, and the Western pastry products are not good. In urban Guangzhou, the price is less than 100 yuan. We arrived at the buffet breakfast after 9 o'clock. There were not many people. Only the pasta had to queue up. The experience was much better. It was quite satisfactory. Chinese style was better than Western style.

msg:I am a big fan of hotels. I didn‚Äôt expect that there is this treasure hotel in Conghua. It is much bigger than I thought. I took my family to check in on Saturday. There were many people checking in at the front desk. I was a little impatient in line and worried that the hotel would be full. It is people who can affect our mood on vacation. I am very grateful to the service housekeeper, Ms. Alice Yang, who is very considerate. She helped me arrange housing and helped me call a car to transport my grandmother who has inconvenient legs and feet. She also responded to questions in a timely manner, which is great!
The hotel is very large, with guests dispersed into different room areas, and the park is also very large, so you won‚Äôt feel crowded anywhere! The only most crowded place is the buffet restaurant. It is recommended that you eat at different times. Breakfast is recommended at 7:30-8:00 or 9:30-10:00. It is recommended to go after 19:00 for dinner. There are really too many people! !
The room is large and the theme room is very interesting. The children like it very much. The only drawback in the room is that the air conditioner is too loud, which affects the rest.
The artificial beach is very good, and the photos are great. There are many staff watching at the waterside, and there is no need to worry about the danger of children playing in the water. It's a pity that the water park is not open at this time. I plan to come back in the summer. Staying here for three days is enough fun!
Recommend everyone to come to this hotel.

Generally speaking, the amu*****t facilities are also very good. Maybe some facilities are not open at the end of summer. I hope to come back in summer. once. Breakfast is quick but a bit unrefined.

The buffet dinner was pretty good, with sashimi, hot pot, and several kinds of seafood. It was quite filling. There are many hot springs, and you can smell different fragrances with different functions. I went to soak at 10 o'clock in the evening on weekdays. It was very clean and almost reserved. It was a great experience~ There are also spa, steam, constant temperature swimming pool and lounge, which is quite comprehensive. It is highly recommended to row a boat, slide slowly and enjoy the scenery. It is very cool and comfortable, and you don‚Äôt need to use much force. Pedal boats are too tiring for your feet. The only regret is that the water park is closed when I come in November, otherwise it would be more fun!

      From the moment you arrive at the hotel lobby, you will be greeted by enthusiastic staff with smiles and provide considerate service~~
      The hotel has a wealth of activities and performances, so you will never feel bored while vacationing here.
      The room is comfortable and a**ospheric. I chose to stay in the Hushan Room this time. The balcony faces the turquoise lake. The view makes people feel soothed. It is really enjoyable to soak in the hot spring in the private pool in the room while enjoying the beautiful scenery~
      There are so many rides in the water park that both adults and children will have fun and won‚Äôt want to leave! Some projects have height and weight restrictions for safety. It is recommended to place an idle reminder at the entrance of the project. Otherwise, you will find that you can‚Äôt play when you climb up. It will be quite disappointing~~
      The hotel's buffet is also excellent! Both breakfast and dinner are of a high standard~
      Special praise to our butler Wang Xiaoru for providing us with considerate check-in service and guidance. Welcome fruits and drinks were prepared in the room, as well as a Peppa Pig doll for the children. He also thoughtfully arranged the check-out for us the next day. ! 10086 likes!

The hotel entrance faces Baishui Village, and the scenery is picturesque against the blue sky and white clouds. We had lunch at the restaurant, which is very big. The meal was served very quickly and tasted very good, especially the Lychee Roasted Chicken with crispy skin and a lot of juicy meat. Highly recommended. Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt take any photos. Many children in the water park didn‚Äôt want to leave after playing for a long time.
I originally planned to eat farm food in the evening, but after playing all day, I didn‚Äôt want to move anymore! I chose the nearby buffet and was surprised when I went in! The food is very fresh and there are really many varieties. I can‚Äôt finish all the sashimi and sushi.

When I get on the bus, don‚Äôt you ask for room number confirmation? The second electric car said that I might have gone to the wrong place. I asked two different lifeguards, and they both said that this is the place where I would wait for the car at the intersection. I was really angry. I was tired from playing all day, and then I had to stand again. After waiting for 20 minutes, I was speechless. The breakfast on the second day was good. There were Indian flying pancakes and a wide variety of breakfasts. The person wearing a polo shirt should be the lobby or restaurant manager. He would take the initiative to say hello to us. This is such a good review. I don‚Äôt know the way to the amu*****t park. When asking for directions, even the sanitation aunt was very enthusiastic in telling me how to get to the destination.

When I arrived at the door, I was deeply fascinated by the weather and environment that day. The blue sky and white clouds blended into the hotel environment without any sense of disobedience. As soon as I arrived at the hotel lobby, there was a friendly little brother to help me carry my luggage. There were not many people, so I checked in. The speed was also very fast, and the lady also gave me an introduction map of the park.
The room I booked was large and clean, and the pool on the balcony was amazing.
There were not many people going to the water park in the afternoon. The water roller coaster is really suitable for timid people like us, and the kayaking is also super cool. After soaking in the water all day, it is not too refreshing to go back to the hot springs for vacation at night.
I experienced the hotel's farm restaurant. The dim sum and mine fish were really great. The breakfast buffet in the morning also had many varieties. I like Chinese breakfast.
Taking photos and checking in is really recommended.

If you feel cold while playing in the water, you can take a dip in the pool. In the afternoon, if the sun is not so sunny, you can go on a boat cruise on Tianyang Lake. It's okay. Watching the show in one day is really not enough, it takes at least two days to have fun... I will recommend it to my friends.

At that time, I thought wow, this hotel can be so big, and if it continues to expand, it will be amazing in the future! I must come again. Before the summer vacation this year, at the subway station in the center of Guangzhou, and in the elevator of my parents‚Äô apar**ent complex, there were advertisements for Forest Sea (Water World) all over the place. I knew it was time! I'm coming! ! ! Before leaving, I remembered the WeChat account of the housekeeper~Xiaoru who came to play with me before, so I went to contact her. Xiaoru introduced Nicole, the lobby manager, to me during her maternity leave. Thank you very much for their arrangement. The old father came out to relax after the waist operation, and informed Nicole on WeChat in advance that he might need to check in early (dad can't sit for a long time and needs to rest in bed after a long-distance bus). Trouble for Nicole, after all summer vacation must be hot. This "unreasonable" request hahaha, she actually solved it perfectly! Really thank her very much. Our family had a great time during this 3 days and 2 nights trip. You can go to her directly for questions about catering, performances in the park, etc. Nicole will also give some tips for playing. The cake sent by the young lady the next night was very beautiful and delicious. As soon as we opened the cake, we all said wow~! wow~! I can‚Äôt finish eating later, so I packed it up and took it home hahahaha (Mum said not to waste my sister‚Äôs heart) In addition, we like the Chinese restaurant and buffet lunch dishes in the hotel very much. They are not too greasy, salty and just right. Mommy was the happiest one at the buffet lunch before leaving. She said that the variety was very rich, and there was also crayfish she had wanted for a long time. Drinks are also directly taken in bottles and cans at will. Not a watered down drink machine. 88/1 person, (elderly or child) is really very very surprising price! Ordinary adults are only 138/person (I still have coupons to reduce by 11 yuan). Another little easter egg (also a detail) The staff here in Forest Sea are very warm and courteous. When we strolled in the hotel, whether it was in the corridor or by the lake, they would smile and greet us whenever we met the staff. When I came two years ago, I was not used to it, haha ‚Äã‚ÄãI was a little socially afraid. When I come back this time, I feel like I am returning to a very familiar place, so when they greet me, I also respond to them with a smile! Finally, I hope that Linhai Hot Spring Resort will be better and better, and the business will be booming! Keep going! We will come again, if we can surprise me again next time, then it will be Taikula!

msg:The forest sea that I have longed for finally came, and I booked a mountain view room, surrounded by mountains and rivers, and a natural oxygen bar. The room is spacious and comfortable, and the waiter's service is excellent. It is recommended to add the housekeeper's WeChat when checking in. The park is very large. If you need to know anything during your stay, you can contact him. WeChat replies are very timely.
There is a Chinese restaurant in the hotel, as well as a buffet restaurant to choose from. I ate at the Chinese restaurant at noon and tried the famous Paitan Wagong Roast Chicken and their own mine lake fish. It was a good experience. I heard that there is a fishing festival in August. The room I snapped up also came with a mineral lakeüêü, but it was a pity that I missed it. Went to the buffet in the evening. The dishes were rich and tasted good. I really enjoyed chatting with the big fat chef, it was so funny.
There are many activities in the water park. You can play as you like. Children can get up close and personal with the fish. It‚Äôs so fun [Âë≤Âë≤]

There are more people on weekends, especially the buffet restaurant, which is so crowded that you have to wait for a table if you go there late. Fortunately, the dishes are rich and served quickly. The things in the amu*****t park are very expensive, and I really feel like I'm being ripped off. The cleanliness of the guest rooms is a bit unsatisfactory. The soaking pool on the balcony is just a decoration and has not been cleaned very much. In short, it does not feel the standard of a five-star hotel. It is still recommended to bring children to play. For adults, it is too noisy and noisy for me.

Service: Zhang Guoying in the restaurant is very nice, with a smile, and will take the initiative to take away the dishes, and ask me if I want to help queue for salmon and oysters.

If you don‚Äôt stay in a hotel every day and come to play, the ticket of about 100 is also a great value! However, it is not recommended to come with too many people, as some items have long queues!

As a result, the yard was less than half the size of the last time, and the room had a peculiar smell, a huge smell! The kind that can't sleep at all!
But since we went back to the room after going to the water park and having dinner, it was too late to change rooms. The smell was indescribable, and I analyzed it to be caused by mold.
The facilities are old, the floors are wooden structures, and the environment is too humid, causing a lot of mold to occur.
I didn't sleep well all night, I felt like I was going to be sick, and I was worried about my child. I will definitely not choose an RV next time.

I chose the Internet celebrity jungle room, which is really suitable for children to play, and you can hide in the room in the scorching sun at noon. The splash room is also my favourite. There are no mosquitoes in the main building, and the swimming area is downstairs, which is convenient and comfortable.
The park is very suitable for young people, children and water sports enthusiasts. The hot spring area is relatively limited, so don't come here for that. The layout and management of the park is still possible. It is also a water park, if you add accommodation, the cost performance is higher than that of Long X.
The hotel's breakfast is slightly inferior. Although the fireworks display is short, it is still good overall, and it is also one of the highlights.

It's quite a holiday, it's hygienic, so it's okay, the elevator is particularly inconvenient. There are too many guests and the service cannot keep up. There was no place for the buffet in the evening. I had to wait in line for more than an hour. When I entered, there was nothing to eat. It is said that Guangzhou has good services and is a mature tourist city. Maybe there are too many people, which makes me feel irritated and there are no services. The resort is a lake, and the environment is actually not bad. Maybe they are all locals and want to stay in the mountains. There is no need to come from out of town. In short, the choice is failure. There are so many people in Water World, so it‚Äôs not as good as just finding a bathhouse here at home. After leaving, the staff even sent a message asking for positive reviews. But my experience was really bad. On the last day of my trip to Guangzhou, I went back with regret. So prepare a strategy in advance and don‚Äôt choose if you come from out of town. Ctrip shouldn‚Äôt recommend this to me, please!

msg:I came to play during the summer vacation. Although it is a weekday, there are many people in the afternoon. After checking in at 3 o'clock, the auntie in the room has not mopped the floor, so I went to the park to play. It is basically good. Many slides must be above the specified weight of 1.4 to play. My baby basically plays on the small slide, and eats dinner directly in the park. It's not very delicious and there are a few meaty ones. There are fireworks to watch at night.

Unlimited water park: fun, children like it very much, play indoors when the sun is strong in the afternoon, there are artificial waves, slides

Breakfast: Basically, there are a lot of bread and fried food, and the taste is also average. I hope to improve this aspect when I buy it!

Probably because the summer vacation price is slightly higher! I think the price is average
Hygiene: OK

msg:I finally came to experience the forest sea during the Dragon Boat Festival. There are a lot of lightning protection posts on the Internet. I have been building my mind for a long time, but I was surprised when I came here. First of all, I think it is very suitable for children of all ages. Children under 5 years old are very suitable. I like to dig sand and swim in the beach pool, and there will be trapeze performances on a regular basis, just watch while playing. There are many exciting water sports for big friends. Of course, if you are afraid of being exposed to the sun, you can play indoors. There are exciting ones and some suitable for younger ages. My child prefers beaches and cruise ships. There is no time limit for cruise ships, but everyone remembers which pier you come from. Which pier, otherwise, it will take a long time to go to the wrong pier. There are three piers in total. The south pier is close to the beach. You can also ask the lifeguards from a distance. There is a pier to feed koi.
The second advantage is that almost all the water villages here have shade, which is very friendly to parents. We play outdoors from 1:00 to 5:00 in the afternoon, and we don‚Äôt feel exposed to the sun.
Third, I think the buffet dinner here is also good. You go to eat around 6 o'clock, and then go back to the park to soak in the hot springs. The time is just right, and there are performances in the park at night. Dinner is much less crowded than breakfast, so everyone has to arrange it at night After a while, the indoor park closes at 21:00, and the hot spring closes at 23:00, so you can play indoors first and then play hot springs. Of course, the swimming lanes downstairs in the hotel can also be played at night. Don‚Äôt go to the swimming lanes the next morning, especially in the afternoon. I can‚Äôt get it out, and finally let‚Äôs talk about the price, because I arrived the day before the Dragon Boat Festival, so the price is the same as usual on Friday, 1799 Mountain Lake Room, including dinner and breakfast for two

There were a lot of people on that day, and we couldn't find the child's bib and tableware, which were specially given to us by Charity. The baby wanted balloon toys, but was afraid of clowns~ Charity also asked us to go back to the dining table first, and then brought us balloons. The baby is very happy. Really grateful to meet such a responsible staff. In addition, during my stay, I called the consultation depar**ent to ask for the baby's toilet, but I heard that it was full last night, so it was probably busy. I didn't give feedback in time, but I never expected that when I opened the door, I met the waiter, Ms. Wang Chunxia, who solved a big problem for me, because the baby refused to go to the toilet without a toilet. She immediately brought it to me and solved a big problem. Really heartfelt thanks. Finally, I would like to thank Chef Chen Juxing of the western food depar**ent. He is very professional. He saw that everyone used different tongs to hold crayfish and then to hold noodles, which would affect the taste of the food, so he reminded each other in time. Made me feel very professional. In such a big venue, everyone's management and behind-the-scenes staff are very attentive and make us feel at home.

msg:A very good play experience, from the environment, play facilities, and the service quality of the staff, are all high-quality. Ouyang Linlin at the front desk also provided considerate service and took care of our entire journey. For children, the hotel where they play in the water has been our ceiling in recent years. I guess if we go to other places to play in the future, we will feel that it is not as good as Forest Sea!

msg:The tree house is very special. The children are very curious. It is so close to the swimming pool. There are too many things to play in it. Some are suitable for adults and some are suitable for children. You can also soak in hot springs when it is cold. It is really amazing!

Because it is a bit far from the lobby, you can choose to take a battery car to pick you up! We have a lot of luggage, and they sent us to the underground parking lot thoughtfully. The service is very good! However, remember to choose the first floor if you have a lot of luggage. It is more troublesome to take the stairs on the 2nd-3rd floor! The air conditioner in the room on the first and second floors is just facing the bed, uh. Not very friendly for people with headaches. It would be perfect if it could be improved!

As soon as we arrived at the hotel, the security guard came to the door to say hello, and helped us carry our luggage and get out of the car. The check-in at the front desk was also very fast. The water park project is still available There are so many items. Although children dare not play many items, they did not finish the items after one day. The evening buffet and breakfast are also very rich. The children have a great time eating. Next time you come, you must book a parent-child room. It can really let the children let go.

msg:1. There are so many projects that they are rare in China

2. The staff service attitude is rare in China

3. Although the hardware is not amazing, the cleanliness is another highlight. Whether it is water quality or the environment, it is also rare in China.

4. There are many mosquitoes, most of the scenic spots are in non-urban development zones, the environment and ecology are relatively natural, which is difficult (about 10 mosquitoes were killed on the balcony)

5. You can‚Äôt even catch fish, so you have to bring your own fishing net to cast it. It should be no problem to catch a few or 10 fish~~ If you catch it, you can take it away (edible, ha)

6. There are brushes and cleaning sprays for the bathtub on the balcony for guests to brush it again. This is great, because no matter how clean it is, there is no need to brush it by yourself. Of course, it is okay not to brush...

7. I wanted to scold at first, but I found that it was okay to deal with it. That is, when I checked in on Saturday (arrived at 1 pm), there were many people (with photos, like at the airport), and the counter opened 4~5 lanes to help speed up. The photo situation was processed between 1:00 and 2:00 p.m. In fact, it was really good. The attitude of the staff was very good, and there was no impatience or ignorance of this and that, and it was difficult to stay for one day. About 5-6 times to ask questions, random people will be very patient and try their best to inform, although it is a bit imperfect (bath towels are not replenished fast enough, the route is far away, and some roads in the middle are due to route design, hotels and entertainment areas some distance in between), but not uncomfortable

8. The crowds at breakfast reappeared, and the hotel also opened a Chinese dining hall (the hall for weddings), and additional food pick-up points (the buffet was originally in the western restaurant, and there was also a Chinese restaurant for breakfast, but the style was reduced by about half)

9. Stay in the hotel and go to the amu*****t area. After reading the tickets for the first time, you can enter after swiping your face for the next 2 days. Similarly, the staff greets people with a smile and generous swiping face, which is really good.

Summary: 3. 5~4. 5 star hardware, 4. 5~5 star software
This is the first time I wrote a comment that I will go again and that there are more praises than criticisms. This hotel is really managed with care. I have stayed in it before. Most of the hardware is five-star, but the software is at Samsung. This time it is really good It‚Äôs rare, the software scores higher than the hardware, the active greeting will not make people feel contrived, and the service attitude will not be impatient (it‚Äôs true that every little brother, young lady, lifeguard and fellow lifeguards in each amu*****t area are very patient. , maybe there are not too many people? ), although some of the most exciting projects will take another 3 days to open, but the flaws are not hidden, enough to play!! It is recommended that at least 3 days and 2 nights are enough to play~~
Go again next time!!

msg:Worst hotel I've ever stayed in. Let me talk about the conclusion first. The price and service of this hotel are seriously unbalanced, and it is comparable to that of InterContinental Huizhou. I advise everyone to avoid these two hotels. Those with a high budget recommend Conghua Congdu, and those with the same budget recommend Conghua Dusit Taili. I understand the mood of parents who bring their children to play, and the requirements are not too high. The hotel's business is very good, and the store is very clear about bullying customers. Negotiations with the hotel on service issues began with check-in. The front office, room depar**ent, and food and beverage depar**ent had no tacit understanding and were arrogant, pushing each other, and the training was seriously insufficient. The hotel butler's attitude is good, but he can't restrain his employees, and the information is seriously poor. But in the afternoon there was basically agreement on all issues. The intensification of conflicts began at night when the hotel falsely advertised the all-day dining restaurant (English all day dining). The service staff told me that I could not dine and that the door was closed, saying that I could only order takeaway or instant noodles. I finally lost my temper and started swearing. Soon the housekeeper told me that I could order food and there was food, which was inconsistent. The most irritating thing is that the catering depar**ent asked me to scan the QR code to place an order by myself, but my friends, look at my picture, I will ask them for help in the afternoon, I hope they will give me a QR code, or send someone to help me find the second QR code has been strongly rejected. These people don't have a long memory, and they asked me to scan the code, so I dropped the phone directly. Finally, after I checked out at the front desk at 11:30, the hotel proposed a solution near 12:00, giving me a late check-out and a 10% discount for dine-in at the restaurant. I laughed helplessly, they didn't even want to check whether I had checked out, how could I postpone my stay or eat when I was not in the hotel. I'm going to call 12345 to defend my rights. There is no way. Renshan is bullied and Mashan is ridden

They took the children to the water world first, and the children had a great time playing. The hotel facilities are complete, and the rooms are luxurious and fashionable with entertainment features. When checking in, the key card for opening the door of the room failed. Ms. Pan, the hotel housekeeper, followed up and solved it in time. The hotel sent a small welcome fruit gift, and the service attitude of the waiters was warm and courteous. Hotel tours, hot springs, and fireworks displays are diverse and complete, making people linger and forget to return. It is indeed a happy time for the family. It would be even better if the breakfast arrangement is better!

The children had a great time jumping up and down. There are boating, flying, water world, hot springs and other related facilities in the hotel, and you can stay for two days to play. The only shortcoming is about the room type. We had already booked at the beginning. At that time, it was displayed as 4 rooms, but later it was suddenly shown as 5 rooms. We were looking for a family to go. In order not to make a fuss, we made a special call for consultation. The other side said there were only 4 rooms. After we went to the site, we saw that there was room 5, and the telephone service needs to be strengthened!

    There are many themed rooms in the hotel, and the overall cleanliness is good. There are various hot spring bathing soups, the water park is divided into indoor and outdoor, and the indoor temperature is constant. It is too cold for the children to play in the outdoor water now, so we are all in the indoor water park, and the children are super happy!
    There are various performances in the whole park: helicopter craft show, water trapeze show, water firework show... children are very playable. The beach, playing in the water, catching fish and shrimp, breaking through levels and climbing, sliding slides...
    The food taste of the hotel restaurant is acceptable, and there are not many types of buffet. Generally speaking, it is recommended, except that it is a bit useless ~ the children are full of energy and are walking around and having fun, and plan to come again next time during the long vacation.

Environment: The surrounding environment of the hotel is very beautiful, there is a very beautiful Tianyang Lake, the air is super good, much more comfortable than in the city, our room also includes a hot spring, after entering the hot spring, you can go to the infinity pool, the scenery is picturesque The next morning, I went to the surrounding area to climb the Baishui Village, and also went to the Shimalong Wetland Park. The hotel is very close to these places, and it takes only a few minutes to drive there.

I heard that the park will be fully opened on the 26th of this month, and I look forward to coming here again on May 1st

I arrived after 12:00 noon. Since I can only check in in the afternoon, I have lunch first. There may not be many people at lunch. Weekdays! I ordered a few dishes with crispy squab skin, crispy skin, tender meat and juicy meat. I said that the squab is cooked raw to lock in the original taste. It is indeed much more delicious than the outside. The fried crab in the typhoon shelter is fried with garlic. The strong garlic flavor is different from other places made of bread crumbs. The pan-fried fish cakes are very refreshing. The squab and typhoon shelter crabs are worth recommending. They are really good. Special thanks to Director Wen Xiaojing for his thoughtful service. We choose the buffet for dinner because the children like it the most. Diversified and rich products are better than many hotels in the urban area, and they are basically CD-ROM operations.

In order to let the elderly have a rest, the front desk took the initiative to contact the waiter to expedite the cleaning. In this way, we directly waited in the caravan while resting.

msg:I came to the "ceiling" forest sea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hot spring hotel with a doubtful and trying attitude. How should I say? I have been thinking about writing a review for a long time. Finally, for the sake of your high-quality service, I decided to write down my feelings this time. Room: We booked a water lane room and a jungle slide parent-child room through Ctrip. Friday is +400 and Saturday is +1200. It can be seen that the price of the two rooms is very expensive. However, there are milk and fruits in the water room, but we probably forgot them in the jungle room. In fact, we don't care about these, so we didn't ask further. After all, you come here to have fun. But it is obvious that the hygiene on the second floor of the jungle room is slightly poorer, and the floors are dusty. Points were slightly deducted for room hygiene and welcome fruit.
Buffet: Arrived a bit late on Friday so there was almost nothing to eat. Saturday was better, a mediocre buffet bar, not much highlights. But on Saturday, a clown brother pinched a balloon and came over to give it to his brother. This was quite heartwarming.
Indoor water park: I focused on praising the operator‚Äôs brother and sister. I specifically asked for their names: Lai Tong and Xu Lujin. This heartwarming gesture was enough to make me a regular visitor. Proactively assist guests in need. This is a kind of awareness in the service industry, special thanks.
Facilities: Really big, the ceiling is indeed the ceiling, you can‚Äôt spend a day hereüëçüëçüëç
Disadvantages: It is recommended to limit the flow of children's wave pools. After all, it's not big inside, but there are too many children, which poses a huge safety hazard.

We originally booked a mountain view room in the main building, but because the hotel was undergoing maintenance, we moved to another room. The villa, the room space is quite large, and there is a private hot spring pool on the balcony (soak it before going to bed, it is very comfortable), the buffet dinner at his house is really good, there is no need to line up to pick up the meal, so I specially made it the next day Go to the beach of the paradise and check in.

There are also many pools in the public hot spring area, most of which are flower pools and traditional Chinese medicine pools. Each pool is not very big. Because it is the off-season, there are few people. If it is the peak season, it may not be enough to soak. There are also a lot of ingredients for the buffet. The dinner seems to have seasonal ingredients. Compared with the buffets of other hot spring hotels in Zengcheng, it is more sincere. Generally speaking, I am already thinking that I must come to experience this super long swimming lane in summer. I hope to come together don't have too many people

The children had a great time playing. The facilities and equipment are also very new. I have experienced both Chinese and Western food. Especially I recommend the fish in lime and sour soup in the Chinese restaurant, which has endless aftertaste so far, and will come again in summer.

msg:This hotel is quite popular and can often be seen on ** and Xiaohongshu. Whether it is products or services, I can see many good reviews. My curiosity made me drive all the way here with my boyfriend on Goddess Day to see the true face! [turn in circle][turn in circle]
At first, I thought that vacation places would be relatively remote, but I didn‚Äôt expect that it would only take about 10 minutes to get off the highway. It‚Äôs quite convenient, and you can see Baishuizhai Waterfall at the entrance of the hotel lobby! We arrived around 16:00 in the afternoon. As soon as we arrived, a little brother helped us with our luggage and guided us through the check-in process. What I noticed was that the little brother here was quite gentle and had a good attitude. What fun things are there in the hotel and the park? What's nearby? If there are any food spots, he can answer them seriously. The key point is that the room is very clean, and some of the waiters are really attentive. I have to give special praise because a waiter happened to pass by me pushing a cart with groceries. After hearing me complaining about my shoulder and neck discomfort, he took the initiative to ask. I was staying as a guest, and then asked me if I needed a silicone pillow, which is suitable for people with shoulder and neck discomfort. This surprised me, and they quickly helped me to the room. I forgot to ask the lady‚Äôs name, but I had to give it. This eldest sister likes [strong][strong]
We had a buffet in the evening. The buffet here felt really popular. Many people ate. The most important thing was that the meals were served very quickly. I thought that the buffet in the hotel would not have too much seafood, but I was surprised. I expected that there was my favorite salmonüç£conchüêöI still want to eat it now that I think about it [Ëâ≤][Ëâ≤]
After dinner, of course it was time to soak in the hot springs. There is a private hot spring pool on the balcony of the room, which is suitable for young couples, but I prefer the outdoor hot springs here. For example, the Bird's Nest pool is somewhat private but can also be viewed. Hotel guests are covered with water. Tickets for parks and hot springs are available, so it is very convenient to directly scan your face at the front desk to enter without paying, including water cruises and water parks. Because it was already late when we arrived at the hotel, we went to the water park at 10 a.m. the next day. There was an indoor park for children to play, and there were several slides and wave pools that adults could play in. There were a lot of outdoor equipment, but Because the weather is relatively cold now, it is really not suitable for driving. If you want to check in, there is an artificial beach in the water park, which is very beautiful for taking picturesüì∑

I stayed here for two days and played with bumper boats, electric cruise ships, and rides on the lake.

msg:Those who bring their families to stay here on weekdays think that there will be fewer people and there will be no crowding. Don't be misled by online reviews, my family and I feel that this hotel experience is really good.
Facilities: Suitable for parents and children. The children's toiletries, bathrobes, slippers, and towels are all available in the room. The housekeeper saw that my child was relatively small, and asked me if I needed a bathtub. It was really considerate. There are also various cruise projects, hot spring pools, water parks, tree houses, and walking in the park is also a very pleasant thing.
Environment: The interior decoration of the hotel is grand, and I found that the guest rooms in his house are ventilated from the front to the back, unlike the usual hotels where the rooms are opposite the corridor. You can see the beautiful scenery from both the corridor and the balcony, while soaking in the hot spring on the balcony. It is very nice to enjoy the night view and breathe the fresh air of the mountains.
Hygiene: The room was cleaned very well. I even touched the table with my hand. It was clean and the bedding was very comfortable. I don't like sleeping on high pillows, so I can ask for lower ones.
Service: The service is very considerate. There are fruits in the room and small gifts for children.

You can buy a big one for 20 yuan Canned fish food was used to feed the fish, and fruit and milk were provided as gifts in the room.

The restaurant with hundreds of people was full of people. If you eat better food, you need to queue up. If it is late, it will be gone. Many tour groups are packed Dinner, so there are too many people, there is no problem with being full. Special thanks to the charity people in the cafeteria who are very enthusiastic and will take the initiative to help get the food. I dare not walk away, and the seat will be gone when I come backüòÇüòÇ Treat people with enthusiasm, If you have any difficulties, you can find her. The hotel as a whole is worth recommending. It is especially suitable for parent-child travel. Many villas in the hotel have indoor and outdoor slides. You can slide down directly from the third floor.

The service can only be regarded as average and does not bring a particularly good experience to the guests. However, the hotel's hygiene level is poor and cannot meet guests' expectations for a hygienic environment. As for facilities, the hotel scored only 2 points and did not provide a wide variety of facilities for guests to use. Overall, the performance of Guangzhou Forest Sea Hot Spring Resort Hotel is relatively poor and unsatisfactory. If you have high expectations for environment, service, cleanliness and facilities, you may want to consider other options.

msg:There are many people during the Spring Festival. I came to check in after 12 o'clock on the seventh day of the new year. It can be seen that the hotel management staff are very hardworking and attentive. Although the line is very long, the hotel has set up another table nearby to open an extra line. And it can be seen that everyone who arrives can get a room, and there is no need to wait for hygiene. I saw too many people, bought something to eat in the lobby, and waited until it was a little faster before starting to line up, and I was able to get a room immediately.
Since I just came here after staying in another hotel nearby, there are good and bad comparisons. The lobby here is not a**ospheric enough, and the public toilet in the lobby is relatively narrow. But the scenery that can be visited in the hotel and the scenery that can be seen from the room are much better.
What people love and fear more here is the buffet. The variety of meals is very rich, but the design of the tables and moving lines in the restaurant is not good. For example, there are too many tables for six people and eight people, which makes it very embarrassing and inconvenient for families with less than four people. The design of the moving line makes a large number of diners crowded in the only aisle. The unreasonable design of the seats and the moving line makes people's quality have to drop a few levels.
But I thought of the motivation to come here again in the future, that is, to skip the buffet and choose in-room ordering (*^œâ^*)

Praise the lake, the water is really clear, there are many fish, and the scenery is charming. Water bumper boats, kayaks, and water bikes are available for unlimited time. In fact, when there are many people, you can limit the time appropriately, otherwise you really have to wait for a long time to play the bumper boat. The indoor water park only has some projects, and older children will be bored. The buffet products are quite satisfactory, the advantage is that they are replenished quickly, there is no food to eat, and there are small pots to cook raw food by yourself. The Chinese restaurant has ample portions and tastes good.

The children have fun and the parents can relax and rest. Lin, the hotel housekeeper, is also very responsible and answers all questions. I will come back again when I have time!
In addition, the hot springs and cruise items are unlimited, and you can still play after checking out, which is great! However, when there are many people, the cruise project needs to queue up.
The hotel's buffet dinner and buffet breakfast are very good, just try to go early, otherwise you will have to wait

There were many people and watched the show. Each floor of the villa has a hot spring pool and a cold water pool. The space of the room on the third floor is relatively small. The 3-bedroom villa package includes breakfast, cruise, and hot spring water world tickets for 6 people. The first time you use it, you need to enter the face, and it will be locked after the entry, and it cannot be used by another person. There are many farm dishes near the hotel, and there are also many fireworks sellers and fireworks during the Chinese New Year, which is very lively.

There is no time for off-road vehicles and snorkeling to watch, and there are helicopter experiences on major holidays such as National Day, and boat cruises on the lake are also good. Thanks to the western restaurant charity for recommending the hotel project and some other help.

If you buy a package that does not include the hot spring water world, you can only take a hot spring in your room. The hotel's heated swimming pools are only available in the hot spring area. of.
The facilities of the room are really average. Many places in the toilet have peeled paint or something. I stayed in the star room. I went to bed at about 11 o'clock at night and found that the light was broken and could not be turned off at all. I contacted the hotel to see that it was indeed broken, and called us. Change rooms. However, because it was too late, the children had already slept, and there were too many things to change. Sleeping with the lights on all night would be affected~
The overall hotel environment is good, but I feel that there are many small problems in the room that need daily maintenance and improvement. The staff are also not very familiar with the business.

msg:When I first arrived at the hotel, Alice, the deputy manager at the front desk, gave a cordial reception, led the check-in procedures, and explained the various facilities and precautions of the hotel. When we arrived at 12 o'clock, we had a room ready and ready to move in, which was amazing. Afterwards, Alice will deal with all kinds of questions and requests in a timely and effective manner, and she must like one!
One must praise is that the hotel has a special person in the store in the afternoon to test the nucleic acid. It is so convenient that you don't have to go out for the test!
The hotel room is good in all aspects. Parents and children must experience it. There is absolutely no problem in staying in two big and two small. It is super spacious! The hotel staff will take the initiative to say hello when they see the guests. Except for the aunts who clean up the room, their service awareness still needs to be improved! Moreover, I also encountered what other guests said in the comments, we were late to check out until a little, and the aunt who cleaned the room was on time 12
At noon, our door was opened without warning, startling us all. When she saw someone in the room, she left immediately. I asked her what's the matter? Why don't you knock on the door and come in? She said we checked out later, no one was there. I said I checked out late, did you not register? She also faced me in the dark, without saying a word of embarrassment! I have stayed in so many hotels, no matter if there is anyone in the room, I will knock on the door and ring the doorbell, and then ask if there is anyone before opening the door. This feels really bad.
Unlimited water park: use face recognition to enter the park, check out the next day, you can enter the park at any time, it's amazing! The park is really good, everything you can think of, parent-child first-class, really suitable for all ages. And it is worth noting that there are hot spring pools near each water project, which is really intimate. However, towels are only available in the hot spring area and the indoor swimming area, which is a bit unsatisfactory.
Unlimited Tianyang Lake water sports: It is a very good project. There are projects for children and adults to play happily, unlimited time and unlimited times!
In general, it is worthy of the price, there is a next time, and the next time must be arranged!

Service: However, the quality and attitude of the service staff are relatively poor, and the staff from the front desk of the buffet to the entertainment facilities all put on such a bad face. It's like you owe money. Much worse than the first two.
It completely reduces the overall sense of the hotel. Trouble the management can pay attention to the training service. After all, the price is not cheap, and the relative service still has to keep up.

@Talk about the bad place. During the National Day, I saw that there were various activities in the publicity, but I was told that I needed to buy a ticket for Leshui No. 1 and No. 1 to go in and watch the performance. In fact, it was not mentioned in the publicity that the corresponding tickets were required to see it, so I left. It took a long way to tell that tickets were needed.
During the National Day, the price of the room has risen a lot, and the tickets included on weekdays have also been taken out, and if necessary, add 400.
It looks pretty ugly.

The small Venice around Guangdong is a place suitable for self-driving tours. On the National Day, I brought my family on a trip that just goes away. It is a hot spring resort in Zengcheng, Guangzhou. The coverage of green plants is very high and the weather in Guangzhou is very comfortable ~Especially suitable for venting for a few days.
This time I stayed in the hot spring, which is a hot spring villa suite with private hot spring ten
Private pool.
As soon as you go out, there is another big swimming lane and you can go directly into the water when you step out of the balcony. The weather in Guangdong is really comfortable recently, so you can take pictures casually, and the pictures are super nice! Girls must come, there are not many people~ This is suitable for vacation, suitable for National Day holiday.
In addition, there are breakfast coupons and Sammi, the lobby manager, is really caring.
There are also children's parks, water parks, hot spring rolls, etc. that come here on weekdays. There are many places to play, and it will not be boring. You can stay for a few days. There seems to be a parent-child room, etc., so you can go with family and friends or bring children. It's really a great choice to come and play for a few days!

msg:A family of three came to play on the National Day and booked a lake-view room. First of all, let‚Äôs talk about the good aspects. 1. The hotel‚Äôs various facilities are really first-class. There are swimming pools, water parks, and hot springs. It is impossible to stay for two days and one night. The facilities are very new; 2. The hotel rooms are very clean and the rooms are equipped with The pool is impeccable in all aspects of hygiene. Next, let's talk about the areas that need to be improved, that is: service! The service couldn't keep up. When we checked in, the receptionist briefly explained the general situation of the hotel, and asked us to add the housekeeper's WeChat, so that we could communicate with the housekeeper directly if we had any questions, and we wanted to go after dinner (around 8:00) in the evening. Playing in the water park, after asking the housekeeper, I found that the water park stopped entering the park at 8:30 and closed at 9:00. So we rushed over in a hurry, and when we arrived at the water park, we were told that we needed two guest room cards (pink hand straps) to allocate lockers. We only brought one card, and my husband and I could not share one card. Ask Whether the staff has a solution, the staff seems to be indifferent, which is really annoying! As a high-end hotel, the demands of the guests can be ignored like this. In the end, the children can only be brought in by me to play, and there are no slippers in the dressing room! Because the enthusiasm of the children to play is too high, we can only play in our own shoes. There are no towels and no tea in the hot spring area. The experience is really bad... To sum up, objectively speaking, all this is because Due to poor communication, it is recommended that the operator of the hotel: 1. List the business hours of a series of entertainment projects, and give each guest a copy, so that we can plan in advance; 2. It is recommended to strengthen the quality training of employees, My dissatisfaction with your staff this time is mainly because of their dissatisfaction with their attitude. The work attitude is wrong, and no matter how capable you are, it is in vain. As a self-driving travel enthusiast, this time I am really serious about the review, I hope your service can be on par with the hotel's hardware!

The hotel service is very thoughtful, especially Alice, from checking in fruits to meal arrangements, the service is in place!
The park is suitable for children of all ages. Stream fishing is one of the highlights. There are many fish, but it is difficult to catch.

msg:According to the online introduction, Forest Sea is the ceiling of Guangzhou parent-child hotel, and we also experienced it.
        First of all, let's talk about the good things:
1. The hotel is near Baishui Village, the natural environment is good, and the water of Tianyang Lake is very clear. The decoration style of the parent-child suite is very pleasing to children. The hot springs and water parks in the suite we stayed in were very close, just get off the elevator to the negative floor.
2. The hot spring and the paradise are connected together and can be freely chosen. The introduction board says that there will be performances at 11:00 am and 16:30 pm. We only watched the performance in the afternoon in the indoor water park, and it felt quite normal, and the host would also mobilize the a**osphere, okay?
3. The hot springs are not all open, maybe because of summer! This is understandable. Several hot spring pools are made of overhead floors, about the second floor high, and there are slides next to them, which is a bit new. The hot spring water is also very clear, there are no floating objects or impurities, and it feels very comfortable. I don't know if it's because it's so hot now that there are fewer people soaking in it, or it's always been like this. But I personally think: as a brand that advertises a high-end route, I hope the quality of water can still be maintained.
4. The staffing of the park is still quite sufficient, and guests will greet them when they pass by, which is also worthy of recognition.
5. The biggest highlight here is that once you book a room, you can enjoy unlimited water play, hot springs and lake cruises for two days. Unlike ordinary hot spring hotels, you can't play after you check out. As long as you enter your face in the hot spring lobby in advance, you can enter the venue, and the same is true for the lake. We checked out the next day and didn't leave until more than six o'clock in the evening, and the children had a great time.
       Saying it well, to the point where it is not enough:
1. The room card here is a bracelet design, and the concept is very good. But the bracelet has a bug that can easily fall off. Especially when you go to play water slides or something, if the impact of entering the water is bigger, the bracelet will be Panasonic, and it is recommended to improve it.
2. Hot springs and water parks do not include lockers. If you need them, you need to pay extra for rent each time. You can rent them twice in two days. This is too inhumane, 35 yuan for one time, 70 yuan for two times, it feels like a pit.
3. The dressing room and toilet in the hot spring did not prepare some basic equipment such as tissues, cotton swabs, and disposable shower caps in advance. My ears got wet and I had to go to the front of the lobby and ask the staff to get the cotton swab. After running so far, I feel sorry for the title of high-end hot spring brand!
4. When playing the trumpet, an employee said directly: "You can't play if it exceeds 90 pounds. How many pounds do you have?" OMG. Is it polite to ask a girl how much she weighs in public? There are still so many people watching this, can't we change the word? The management needs to be properly trained on this point, otherwise how can they live up to their own brand positioning.
5. The water temperature of the indoor swimming pool is too low. Although it shows 27¬∞C, it still feels cold at the moment of entering the water. Since the main brand of hot springs, are you considering having a heated swimming pool? After all, the water temperature of the indoor swimming pool with open sun will be slightly lower than that of the outdoor place where the sun is exposed.
6. The road from the hot spring lobby to the water park is very long, and there are no big trees around to shade. If you can add some awnings, it will better reflect the people-oriented service tenet. Of course, it would be better to add a sunshade to the Tianyang Lake pier. It is also recommended that you bring a sunshade when you visit the lake next time, especially when you swim in the lake, otherwise you will feel like a barbecue.
7. The taste of the dishes in the Chinese restaurant is okay, but the price/performance ratio is not high. The four of us ate more than 400 for the first meal, and the second meal cost nearly 300. On the contrary, the nearby farms have high cost-effective meals. Although the local environment is average, each dish is full of weight.

I booked a three-day, two-night star parent-child room on Ctrip three weeks in advance during the summer vacation. Check in with excitement, and the experience is really good after three days. The hotel is surrounded by mountains, the scenery is pleasant, the air is fresh, the hotel facilities are very new, and every place is guided by thoughtful waiters, so it is safe for children to play on the water. Our room housekeeper, Sister Shrimp, is very warm and caring. Every day, she sends WeChat messages to remind us where we should go to play and where to find something fun and delicious. He also gives pistols and dolls for children to play with water. Drinks are not enough to say very much. It will be delivered soon... In short, the three-day and two-night leisure vacation is very free, comfortable and comfortable. I will definitely recommend it to my friends, and I will bring the children there to eat, drink and have fun next time.

The air in the RV area is very good, the independent courtyard is very private, and the scenery is very good. It's a pity that there are no tools, otherwise the barbecue is also very comfortable.
The play measures are very suitable for children and adults, and they will not walk if they play - ÃóÃÄ(‡πë·µî‚åî·µî‡πë)
Finally, it is worth mentioning that the service is very good and in place. Everywhere the staff are very enthusiastic to help solve problems, especially our housekeeper - Xiaochao.

We also worked overtime to help us arrange it, and personally picked it up at the pier, which was very good! ‚úå(Ãø‚ñÄÃø‚ÄâÃøƒπÃØÃøÃø‚ñÄÃø Ãø)‚úå

The water park is divided into a children's area and an exciting area, which are suitable for tourists of different ages. There are many restaurants in the park, and you can play for a full day.

The hotel has three buffet meals, but it is said that many people did not choose the buffet. There are several farmhouses in front of the hotel, and the taste is also very good.

This time I feel really good, the service attitude is really good, and the staff in the hotel are really serious and responsible. After checking in, it can be said that after several twists and turns On the day of check-in, I was told that the Typhoon Water Park will be closed for one day. On the first day of check-in, my daughter sprained her foot while water skiing. The hotel's medical staff also personally helped with ice compresses and topical medicines. Genuine Bida Pain Relief Cream and Yunnan Baiyao Spray are urgently needed. The hotel staff Lin Yueyang also saw the child sprained his foot and braved the typhoon to drive the hotel car to take us to the hospital for registration and filming. The next day, the child's phone watch was lost and someone else picked it up. When I took it away, the hotel staff patrol and security personally took me to the location of the watch to help find the watch together. Although the child's phone watch was turned off by the other party and couldn't be retrieved, the hotel management and staff's service attitude was all about me. In the future, this is the hotel with the best service and management that I have stayed in so many hotels, and we will choose to stay again next time!

Friends can't get 3,000 for a single reservation. You can check in when you arrive at the store at 13:30 on Sunday, very satisfied! The 3002 room is allocated to the southeast, overlooking the lake and mountains, and the night is very quiet. I am very satisfied! The room is air-conditioned and quiet, the twin beds can be combined with a large bed, the pool is unlimited, and the small refrigerator is free to drink Coke Sprite Fanta and Paris mineral spring + 2 bottles of pure water + fruit plate, and children also have 2 boxes of milk + dolls. satisfy! The problem is mainly in the hardware of the room, the open bathroom cannot be restricted, and the lower half of the toilet door is transparent and can be seen casually, which is embarrassing! There is no password safe in the room, which can't keep up with a 5-star hotel! The design of the hotel's hot spring area is also relatively poor, not recommended. The main time is to go to the water park. The children have a lot of fun. After checking out, they can continue to play for free by brushing their faces.

Then after adding a butler on WeChat, basically any questions are answered in seconds. The parent-child suite is not divided into areas like the page. Although it has little impact on us, it will be better if the area is divided into areas for privacy. The parent-child suite has children's products, children's slippers, and mosquito-repellent essential oils. Like, the newly opened water park does not need money for the time being, but many projects have to queue up and are relatively dry. The most fun is to go into the water and swim with the koi! The queue for the electric boat was long, we waited until 6 o'clock. There is no need to queue for hand rowing, but you cannot enter the water below 1.2 meters. There are many varieties of breakfast, and the products in the Chinese restaurant are also very good.

Because the weather is too hot, basically all rooms, swimming pools, children's playgrounds, rowing boats, and public hot springs have not gone. The hotel is expanding , There will be a large indoor and outdoor water park in the later days. The sound insulation of the room is OK, but the air conditioner is a bit noisy~ The housekeeper and the waiters are all good~

There are many hotel projects, hot springs, water parks, super-long swimming pools, and boating to feed fish. Stayed for two days and both children and adults had a great time. At night, I soaked in the hot springs to sleep, and it was easy and comfortable to die. Special thanks to Sammi Lin Shurong, the lobby manager, who added my WeChat since check-in, answered various questions, and informed a lot of precautions and time regulations. Very patient, let us avoid a lot of detours for the first time. Everything is satisfied, will come back next time!

There are many farms near the hotel, it is very convenient to eat, and there are many small stalls selling fruit along the road.

Hygiene: The hygiene in the room is very clean. We stayed in the parent-child room this time. There are shower rooms and toilets upstairs and downstairs, which is very convenient. We enjoyed the evening buffet and the morning buffet at the hotel, the tableware and food were very good.

Environment: The lobby of the hotel is very spacious. We checked in quickly, drove directly to the -1 floor, and took the elevator to our parent-child room. The hotel has indoor and outdoor water parks, hot springs, boat rides, wave pools, and many entertainment facilities, all of which are free. Children can play for a long time in Xie Paradise. There is a long swimming lane downstairs in the room and in front of the villa, and a large swimming ring is rented. It is very convenient and fun for children to play there.

Service: Alice, the lobby manager, was very considerate, gave us clear guidelines, and told us that we can save 20 yuan by ordering the evening buffet before 4:00. When playing in the water park, the staff also pays special attention to safety, and reminds the children accordingly to pay attention. We stayed in a parent-child room this time. The room provided a lot of drinks, fruits, and a rag doll, which the children liked very much.

We are very satisfied with the hotel's environment, entertainment items, buffet quality and staff service, and we will continue to choose this hotel next time.

That is, when we went to bed at around 9:52 in the evening, we found that the lights on the stairs could not be turned off, which affected our sleep. I asked the housekeeper to help me with it. At that time, I thought that this is an easy thing to solve. Just teach me where to close it. As a result, after waiting for 27 minutes, the result was that my engineering colleagues needed to come and handle it. I'm all mad...! I spent 4,288 yuan for a night in a room that told me to turn off the lights on the stairs, but the waiter who brought fruit to the room the next morning told me that pressing the main switch would turn off all the lights on the stairs! Oh my God! Why can't the housekeeper in the hotel even press the switch button of his hotel room? ironic

msg:A happy parent-child summer vacation trip, taking the children to swim in the net red swimming lane and splashing in the water. Compared with the two net red swimming lane hotels I have been to before, the swimming lane here is a bit small and there are many people coming and going, so I can't let go. But when I booked the hotel, I gave a ticket to the newly opened water park. There are different amu*****t items, which are very suitable for children to play. It makes up for some deficiencies, and the overall is not bad.
The hotel villa we stayed in has 3 rooms, which is very clean and comfortable. The first floor has direct access to the swimming lane. However, the 3 rooms are not connected to the room. Each room has an independent hot spring pool, which is very convenient, but because they all go up and down the stairs, it is not convenient for children and the elderly to live on the 3rd floor. The staff here are very warm and polite, and the team leader Xiaolian has arranged very well and is very considerate. Knowing that we have children who specially send us children's toiletries, recommend nearby food, and arrange a battery car to send us when we leave the store. Because the nucleic acid needs to be done the next day, I went to the nucleic acid site to check online and told us that it would be suspended today. I hurriedly contacted the hotel housekeeper Sammi, who very thoughtfully informed the hotel of the nucleic acid location, and ran us carefully in the rain to make arrangements for us. . I really feel that they are serving us attentively, which is much better than the service of the two Internet celebrity swimlane hotels I went to before. I hope that the next time I go to play, I can meet such a good service staff! !

First of all, you need to brush your face in public hot springs. Before, you only needed a room card! The public hot springs used to provide free lockers, but now they charge 38 yuan! The free tea and fruit in the public hot springs are also not free! This time, I happened to meet the free trial play of the water park, but the outdoor area of the park is not open to the outside world. The indoor ancient sea water kingdom will come out as soon as it enters, and the decoration is very strong! If it costs 228 yuan to enter the park, it's really not worth it, I'd rather go to Chimelong! Room and restaurant service is good, warm and thoughtful! 388 yuan for two adults buffet, 108 yuan for seniors over 65 years old, quite satisfactory...

But the RV is still a long way from the water park, so I only play in the private pool. This time I didn't go to the Internet celebrity swimming lane or the water park. I have to drive to the hotel to eat buffet. Some will be connected there, it will be more convenient.

The swimming pool in the room is about 11 meters long and 1.3 meters deep. The children have a good time, but the water quality is not good enough, and it is a little turbid. What is even more uncomfortable is that there is garbage from upstairs residents on the balcony and in the swimming pool. I know if it was thrown on purpose or if it was blown off by the wind. In the case of dining, the buffet is very noisy at night, not as quiet as the Chinese restaurant next to it. Remind the guests in the back that when playing in the swimming lane, remember to take care of your belongings. Last year, we had a bag on the chair that was taken away, and the bathrobe and glasses were lost.

The children liked it very much. I was wondering whether to connect the room to the swimming lane, but I didn't need it in the actual test, otherwise it would be very wet, and the swimming lane was next to the room, which was very convenient. The private pool is very suitable for taking the baby to soak, we simply didn't go to the public one. Please pay attention to the picture 5, I actually found the northern baked gluten in the buffet! What a surprise! The taste is also very good, much better than what you can find in the city. The lake view is also completely beyond imagination. The lake water is extremely clear, and there are beautiful goldfish in it. You can clearly see groups swimming in the water. In the distance, you can almost see Baishuizhai Waterfall directly. I feel that the room contains these items, so there is no other expenditure, and I am very satisfied. Finally, I would like to focus on the service aspect. Ms. Zhang Guoying provided us with extremely warm service and extended our room for an hour. Thank you very much (*^_^*).

After checking in, I will help you immediately if you need help. She is very enthusiastic and has a very good attitude. Stayed for 3 days and did not find other staff who commented that the service attitude is not good, a very good family trip

üçÉEnvironment: The scenery is beautiful, very decompressing

üßπSanitation: very good, the staff has cleaned the swimming pool for a long time, and the cleaning is very clean
üöó Traffic: There are many high-speed curves from Huadu, and there are many big trucks when I go there. It is a little nervous for a novice like me, but it's fine when I come back.

Breakfast: The breakfast is very rich. I like chicken feet, fried eggs, sausages, etc. The taste is good

Buffet dinner: After two days of buffet eating, I have eaten a bad food. I am greedy and want to eat everything I see.

Cruise project experience: I played with my baby once. She was just 1 year old and she didn't like wearing a life jacket and kept crying. She had to finish it hastily. I asked my husband to accompany me once after he was busy. The scenery was very good. There were small fish following the boat.
Wait for the new project to open and consider going again~ Next time I will go to the RV
Check-in at 3 pm to 12 o'clock the next day counts as one day. If the baby goes to bed early in the evening and can't play anything, it is better to stay for 2 days. It is not a holiday.

I originally booked a villa room on the second floor. I found that the balcony of the room on the first floor can go directly to the swimming pool. Considering that children are convenient for swimming, I changed the room type. The room is very large, with a living room and Mahjong hall, another jungle room, the room is quite big, children's toiletries, slippers, bathrobes are available. The bed downstairs is a bit small. The rooms are generally okay. But in the evening buffet, there are many dishes, but the taste is average, and the quality is not very good. I hope it can be improved.

The main room type of the hotel is very popular with children, and it is also very good to take a separate pool. The boat on the lake is electric and you can buy fish food to feed the fish on the boat. The butler service is ok, if there is something left, I am actively helping to find it.
Areas to be improved: The buffet lacks beer, wine, etc., the gym is not open, the children's playground is small, the trampoline, slide, ocean ball pool is very small, and other entertainment items such as the cinema, archery, target, racing game machine, etc. I don't know if it is ignored or not I don't seem to have seen it. There are few types of hot spring pools. I feel that there is nothing to soak in. The spa SPA pool facilities lack the powerful back massage and the water gun. Fishing and shrimps will not be completed and opened until July. The wooden floor on the second floor of the main room type duplex is very noisy and noisy at night. There are no lively activities at night. After eating, I went back.

The restaurant waiter is not familiar with the ticket inspection process, which leads to repeated queues of customers, and we ignore our appeals.
The two bathrooms in the room have poor drainage. At the beginning, there was no hot water, so I called someone to repair it.
At the end of May in Guangzhou, the outdoor swimming pool was not yet open. It was also a mistake I didn't ask when I booked the hotel, but the Xiangjiang next door was already open. The surrounding construction is really noisy, and many facilities are not perfect

ü•öBreakfast (in the form of meal delivery): Unfortunately, there was no buffet when I went there, but the breakfast delivered was very rich, porridge, flour, ham, eggs, quail eggs, sweet potatoes, glutinous rice, chicken fritters, bread, yogurt, bananas (one per person!)
üöê Facilities: Although the RV is small, it has all the internal organs. The comfort is definitely not as good as the rooms, but! ! The yard is really, really great! There are separate swimming pools and hot springs, and separate outdoor showers and toilets. There are also two empty meadows, perfect for camping. There is also a dog kennel (very intimate). The car can also be parked at the gate of the yard, and it is very convenient to carry luggage.
üçÉEnvironment: The outdoor environment is absolutely stunning and the air is fresh. There are many mosquitoes and bugs, but the hotel has placed three large mosquito killers in the yard. Be sure to bring toilet water!
üîîService: Butler service is great! The battery car is available for pick-up and drop-off on call. If there is a need, it will basically respond within five minutes. It may be that there are not too many guests on the day, and the check-out is delayed until a little for free!
Little regret: I didn't read the weather forecast in advance. It was a thunderstorm and it rained a lot, so I couldn't set up a tent in the yard to play.
All in all, will come again next time! ! !

msg:It's the third time I've been here! I have basically stayed in the three types of parent-child rooms. Whether the room is clean or the attitude of the room attendants is still good, but the buffet does not have as many things as before, and there is no salmon, hairy crab, lobster and seafood hot pot, because we went on a weekday, I don‚Äôt know if it is Not only available on weekends. Family birthday, communicated with the hotel in advance, sent cakes, and delayed the check-out time, very good! I heard that a water park is under construction, I hope to come again next time~

msg:There are not many choices for the temporarily booked room. My friend's twin room is more than 1900, and the extra bed will be charged 398 (including breakfast), but the average price of an extra bed in other star hotels is 200, and a buffet breakfast of 198 is more than Expensive. The price of the parent-child room I stayed in was 2388 on Friday, and the facilities in the room were quite satisfactory. The hot spring pool water is not limited, fruits, earplugs, anti-mosquito stickers, children's bathing suits, toothbrushes and slippers are all complete and considerate. But when I checked in, I made an oolong. It was difficult to find a room. I kept asking people, and everyone said that it was in front of me. After turning around a few times, I found that there are residents in the room, how embarrassingüòì. Later, I asked the waiter to check and found out that the front desk gave me the wrong room number. Take the elevator from the lobby to the hot spring area on the negative floor. It is another maze tour. You have to go through the parking lot to get to the hot spring lobby. For the first time, I was looking for directions everywhere. I hope the hotel can make the signs bigger, the direction The guidance is clear. The women's locker room can be praised. The preparation is very comprehensive. It is not good when you go to the hot spring area. There is only one place to change the towels. It is next to the bridge that enters the hot spring area. , too inconsiderate.
        The basic recreational projects in the courtyard are all under construction, only off-road vehicles and dock cruise ships are open, and one off-road vehicle costs 300. Overall, this experience is not ideal, and the price/performance ratio is not high.

msg:I booked a room on Friday and checked in on Saturday. There is only a twin room, but the double bed can be made up by myself, it doesn't matter. Check-in at about 1:30 pm, because it took a while for people to take pictures, but there were not many people at that time, so it was fast, and the room was arranged quickly and was being cleaned. We took the children to the children's playground. The children's playground has a wave pool, a bed jump and two slides, but the 3 and a half year old said the slide was too fast and did not dare to play. The room is spacious, the bedding is comfortable, there are children's slippers, toiletries and bathrobes, but you need to contact the housekeeping depar**ent to send them. In the evening, I brought fruit, milk and a rabbit doll to the room. The child was very happy and caring. We are staying here for the second time. Compared with last April, the program is richer. The cute pet paradise can receive 38 gold coins per room to exchange for small gifts or feed the lambs with carrots, small fireworks, and roast sweet potatoes; Tianyang There are free and unlimited cruises in the lake, and the boat is still electric. My brother also specially found a water jet boat. The children had a great time. I bought a can of fish food for 20 yuan and fed it on the boat. It was very fun. Tianyang Lake is very big, the water is very clear, and you can see all kinds of fish in the lake. It was sunny and windy that afternoon, very comfortable, but it was a little cold after the sun went down; there was a bonfire party at 7:30 in the evening; 8:00 There is snow; 8:30 fireworks show. The temperature of several hot spring pools is between 38.3-39.0, which is more friendly to children. There is a seating area with free tea and fruit. I bought the meal coupons for the buffet dinner at my own expense. I started queuing around 5:30 p.m. to exchange meal coupons and wait for a table, and I started to enter the venue at about 5:45. The variety was rich and realized the freedom of mantis shrimp, shrimp, grilled scallops, beef tenderloin, chicken The pancakes and red bean paste are ok, but the fish has no salmon, and the tuna has tendons. The bad thing is that there are really too many people. The four-person table where our two big and one small were seated was also taken by two people. Looking around, it was crowded with people, and the seats were full. The addition is very timely, which is good. Remember to go early! The next morning we went to the cafeteria for breakfast at about 9:30. The breakfast was rich in variety and replenished in a timely manner, but there were so many people that it was difficult to find a seat. I contacted the personal housekeeper, Miss Zhu, who enthusiastically applied for us to delay the check-out time until 1:00 pm. Overall, it is very good, suitable for parent-child travel, with rich activities. I feel that after I participate, the time for bathing in the spring will be squeezed out. But there are too many diners, which affects the experience. (There is a large piece of roasted sweet potato for 15 yuan in the hall, which is sweet and soft, which is quite good)

The scenery of the hotel is very beautiful and suitable for taking pictures. You can go to the hot springs in winter. It would be perfect if the children's playground was bigger. This time on my sister's birthday, the hotel also sent a cake, which is very warm. By the way, the breakfast is also very rich. Although there are many people, the food is very abundant.

There is a big lake in the hotel, the scenery is very good, you can drive your own boat, and there is no limit to the number of times you can stay with the bracelet of the hotel, and children like it very much. You can also feed fish by the lake. There is a cute pet paradise in the square in front of the hotel. You can feed lambs and peacocks inside, as well as the children's playground Bobo Pool, which are all items that children like. It's a pity that the net red swimming lane is not open in winter. Special praise for the caring and warm service of the hotel butler Stella, who can answer questions in a timely manner and meet various requirements of the guests, which is very good. The dishes in the hotel's Chinese restaurant are also very good. I am very satisfied with the two meals, and the price is not expensive. Seeing that there is still a water park under construction in the hotel, I am looking forward to it, and I will come back when it is completed. Suggestion: There are few hot spring pools in the hotel, and the water temperature is a bit too high, which is not suitable for children. In addition, I hope that there are children's supplies in the room, such as bathrobes and slippers, cups. Hope it will be better next time.

It's not a single-family house, and it feels a little bit private. I had to walk a long way to have breakfast on a rainy day, and I almost fainted. There are a lot of people in the breakfast, which is very rich. The room sent fruit and good night milk, but also small accessories. It is still very refreshing to take a hot spring in the room. Time is a matter of time. I didn't go to the public area, which is a loss. However, the room was large and comfortable, and the front desk service was very good.

There are many parent-child projects, and housing is free to participate. The cruise ship saw beautiful koi, the fireworks at night were beautiful, and the lion dance was wonderful.
The only thing that needs to be improved is that the capacity of the full-time restaurant is not large, the breakfast is rich but there are too few seats. When I went at nine o‚Äôclock, there were almost no vacancies. Later, I scattered one or two and sat down like this, and didn‚Äôt eat together. It started to be empty one after another. It is recommended to go for breakfast at 8 o'clock.
Dinner buffet, the level is average, to be fair enough to eat.
The next day, I booked a private room in a Chinese restaurant at noon. It is more distinctive to eat four fish with one meal, and the food is served quickly. The black gold bao is delicious.
Overall it is good, looking forward to the next time it will be better!

msg:The hotel is newly opened and the environment is good. At the foot of Baishui Village, the price is the price of a five-star hotel, but the service given is a one-star hotel, which is not as good as a chain hotel. First of all, call the front desk on the day of check-in, and call the front desk three times until the line is disconnected, and no one answers. The phone in the room can hear the other party's voice for a while, but the other party can't hear your voice for a while. It took me more than ten minutes to connect, but it kept saying that it could not be connected; the heating in the hotel room could not be turned on, and the customer service said that the hotel can turn on the heating automatically if it is below 10 degrees, and it was very cold at night; On the slide, the entire waist and elbows were bruised, and the hotel butler did not apologize, and it was nothing. At night, the child accidentally dropped the bracelet into the pool while swimming in the pool. The ones salvaged from the deep water area belonged to someone else. I found the hot spring front desk. The front desk asked me to leave a room with a name. They would send someone to look for it. They explained that it was easier to find Shuijing after closing the door. I repeatedly told the front desk to reply, but the front desk perfunctory , By the next day, the child found 11:30 from 10:30 and salvaged 2 bracelets, which were not ours. The front desk of the hot spring didn't reply to my phone call when I checked out. When I checked out, the front desk of the hotel was too embarrassed to ask for a compensation of 50 yuan for the lost bracelet. We were angry at that time. Let me ask, children also have such patience and sense of responsibility to find a hand. Huan, aren't your staff members as good as two 12-year-olds? Where has your sense of responsibility gone? A child can fish out 3 bracelets from a deep water area, so are your staff blind? If I lose one, I will pay 50 yuan. If my child finds 3, can I get 150 yuan back? The hotel has not had a positive reply so far. A room of nearly 1800 yuan, such a service, are you worthy of the price?

The hotel will have a room at the earliest at 3 o'clock, but check out at 12 o'clock the next day, which is not enough. Besides, there are many restrictions on the facilities inside. One would say that the weight had changed, one would say that the height was not enough, and one would say that the parents were accompanied. The funniest thing was that the three slides were open at the same time, but they did line up to play one by one. The analysis said that it was afraid that too many people would slide down at the same time and cause collisions, but there was a small slide next to it, and no one cared about it, and the children flowered one after another, and it was fine!

Breakfast and dinner can be enjoyed by boat through the restaurant opposite, or you can drive, check in the RV and other rooms Not in the same place, there is a small yard in front of the RV, the space is relatively spacious, the hot spring pool is opposite the lake, and the scenery is first-class. According to the housekeeper Vivian, this is a real hot spring, and it does have minerals and a smell. In addition, Vivian's introduction to the RV facilities is very detailed. If you have any questions, you can contact us at any time to solve the problem. Like! The hotel facilities are relatively new. I would like to experience other room types next time. In addition, I can try the buffet at night. It is recommended to arrange for a staff to take a seat for breakfast. During peak hours, guests need to take their own seat, which is very chaotic and the food is not too hot. Talking about the shortcomings of the RV, it rained a little that night, and the rain hit the roof directly, affecting sleep. The interior is cramped, and sleeping next to the refrigerator will hear the power sound all night long. The hotel is more suitable for parent-child travel, and many free items can be played.

msg:Although it is inconvenient to travel now, it is not recommended, but after all, it is to celebrate the 10th anniversary, so I still have a small celebration, breathe some fresh air, climb a mountain to see some water, and then soak in a hot spring to relieve the tension of muscles and bones, and increase resistance at will. Thank you, Manager Alice, for assisting in the check-in, otherwise the planned and expected celebrations would have been stuck at the entrance of the parking lot and could not be entered.

Compared with other hot spring hotels, I think it is quite clean, the courtyard is well cleaned, and there will not be a lot of sundries in the (outside) hot spring, and there are not many people gathered together, talking loudly or playing music to affect others . If I want to say something, I hope the hotel can recommend taking a shower before entering the hot spring. After all, hygiene is more important during the epidemic (I still see a lot of people who don't wash it). Also, because I like to take a bath in the morning, it is a pity that the hot springs are almost not ready when the business hours start at 9:00 in the morning.

Overall it's still great, whether it's sitting on an electric boat on the lake next to watching the scenery blowing the wind, or playing with small animals in the garden, it's really suitable for a family. When it is more suitable for travel, I will definitely bring relatives and friends here to play.

The starry sky room is quite large, with two floors, a balcony and a private hot spring pool, which can accommodate 4 adults and 2 children.
It is recommended to eat breakfast in batches, one batch every 1 hour, and it is better to stagger the peak.
The lake is so clear that you can dive in.
Hot spring towels are clean, drinks and fruit services are in place.
There are still many projects under construction, and I will experience them when they are completed.

I have experienced off-road vehicles, electric boats, water jet boats, helicopters, children's playgrounds, hot springs and slides, and bonfire parties. The most amazing thing is that there are small fragrant pigs on the small farm in front of the lobby. There is also a walk on the plank road by the lake. The water quality of the lake is very good, and there are no pollutants and floating objects on the side. Although the hotel management details are not as standardized as the global five-star hotel chain, the service is very attentive. No matter the guest room, restaurant or lobby, you can feel that they are working hard to serve and hope that customers are satisfied. Although there are a lot of people staying on New Year's Day, the service response is also very fast. The first room was leaking as soon as I entered, and the hotel immediately arranged for a replacement. The children are very satisfied with the room, the amu*****t equipment in the room is very fun, drill up and down. There is also a toilet upstairs, which is very convenient, so there is no need to go to the toilet at night. Come and experience it again in summer.

msg:The last time I lived in a four-bedroom lake-view villa, I felt that the angle of the lake view was too small. When I was walking, I found that the scenery of the five-bedroom and six-bedroom was absolutely superb. This time I decided to book a six-bedroom villa. Still so popular, I want to stay for two nights on the weekend, but only Saturday night is available............
Facilities: The hardware of the villa is not mentioned, all aspects are very good, each room on the 2-3 floor has a bubble pool, and there is a big bubble pool on the 3-4 floor, especially the view of the bubble pool on the top of the 4th floor Invincible. It‚Äôs only a pity that as the most expensive room type, a new wooden house is being built next door, and a certain corner of the landscape is affected by the experience of the construction site. The noise from the construction site during the day still has a big impact... I feel at least not during the construction period. It should be so expensive. Most of the rooms are very satisfactory, but I found a room on the 2nd floor was wading off the wall, a large piece of it fell off and the area was dusty, and I didn‚Äôt find it during cleaning (it may be dropped after cleaning), but usually Failure to discover the situation in time for maintenance is inappropriate, and there are hidden dangers.
Service: This time, there are a lot less people than the last time. The butler Xiaowen beauty‚Äôs service is very enthusiastic, but sometimes we can‚Äôt get in touch with WeChat.........Here I have to complain about the person who handles the pool water. Last time and this time I stayed. It‚Äôs not very active to release the pool water and to wash the pool. This time I said that swimming is generally not allowed in winter. I strongly demanded that I was willing to wash the pool and release the water after communicating with the housekeeper. As a result, I released the water and forgot to close the water outlet. No water was stored in the afternoon, so I called for a few times before I came to deal with it.
Breakfast: The breakfast is as always crowded and the experience is extremely poor, but it can be seen that the waiters and chefs are doing their best to meet the needs of the guests. This makes me feel that a five-star hotel should have a service attitude
Others: Free rides on the lake, such as rowing boats, canoes, etc. are good, children are very happy to play, many people are playing small games on the grass during the day, and it is noisy. It is recommended that the hotel can arrange hotel amu*****t projects in a unified manner. Since it is the top-level villa room type, whether it is the passage out of the lake, the grass and the dining suggestions, there should be a special space, so the experience will be better.
The sensor lamp design of the villa stairs is very problematic. The sensor port is set at the entrance and exit of the elevator. If you only go up the stairs, the light will not be bright. I often find the stairs in the dark. I feel that this light is not for people who take the stairs. ...There is no such problem in a four-bedroom villa

I will still write a real review about the hotel: the hotel facilities and services are first-class, reaching a five-star level, I like it better.
The swimming lane should be very popular in summer, and it is quieter in winter, and it happens to be quiet. Although there are not many clean people in winter on weekdays, it also has a sense of a**osphere and the hotel is very warm.
The lake here is really clear, and it looks beautiful when the sun is sunny. It‚Äôs just that those water projects are too difficult to take a purely natural photo. It is recommended to remove all water projects. The scenery here is beautiful, these water projects are a point of violation, after all, this is not an amusement park. You can build another place for children to play, and children can have fun anywhere.
Regarding the restaurant, the breakfast and dinner we ate were buffets in the western restaurant. Except for the hot pot, the dinner ingredients are basically cold, which makes it uncomfortable for the stomach. The shrimp is frozen and not too fresh. In my memory, it seemed that the German pig knuckle was okay, but the others were more unpalatable. But there are many varieties, and everything is available for dessert.
There are also many types of breakfast. Maybe the food at night is too mixed and the food is not fresh, so the stomach is not good. I don‚Äôt want to eat so many breakfasts. I want to eat light porridge and fried dough sticks, as if there is no fried dough sticks. There should be more hot-stir-fried vegetables for breakfast, as well for dinner. Maybe it's the reason for the current low season, right? Add some western lettuce to the salad, and the cucumber slice bar is more authentic.
Everything else is still very good.

msg:The location specially selected for my husband‚Äôs birthday, first of all, I want to praise the customer service of Ctrip and me. I think what I think. Second, the hotel‚Äôs housekeeper Jiu Sanyou arranged the room in advance and specially sent a birthday cake. It also brought surprises to my husband. Thank you. Next time
The only dissatisfaction is that the cafeteria did not clearly inform the children and the elderly of the discount. When the problem was discovered, the supervisor surnamed Liu was still shirking the responsibility, and he did not have a positive attitude to consider the guests. It was not until the manager was hired to solve the problem as a highly competitive service industry. The quality of the staff also represents the level of the entire hotel. I hope that it can be improved in the future.

The space is enough for children to play everywhere. The hotel is the parent-child route, so the details are convenient and well done. The double staircase The protruding corners will be wrapped with anti-collision corners, the washbasin will have two high and low wash basins for children to wash; and each room type is equipped with a private bathing pool, and the female guests who go to the public hot spring are also very clean. The breakfast is also rich, and there are many entertainment items. Anyway, I had a lot of fun in the hotel for two days. Already ready for the second brush

msg:In the summer, I have always wanted to book an ocean splashing room, and spend the hot summer with bubble water and water fights.
As a result, from the scorching summer until October, I feel the same temperature at the end of autumn
The cold air brought Guangzhou into the autumn successfully and also solved my obsessive-compulsive disorder in choosing a house.
Don't hesitate to punch in the internet celebrity jungle room! The slide is really endless! I feel like I can play it back to Ben Hahahaha
It is estimated that many people have overlooked the spiral slide area, and it is still very good after we walked for two laps!
Then there are a lot of novelty gadgets in the hot spring area
Bobo Pool, the green fairy pool, and don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs dedicated to children‚Äôs slides, but there are actually several hot springs on the Bird‚Äôs Nest.
There are also indoor spiral pools, massage pools, etc. The massage is quite comfortable!
I feel that the forest sea is much more fun than traditional hot springs
A hotel full of 3.4k during holidays, really interesting [snicker R]

msg:A family trip in Guangdong Province, I wanted to experience an RV. I found this hotel and it was only more than an hour away. I immediately booked two room types. On the first night, I experienced the RV camp. After I arrived, there were some surprises. Each RV is a private courtyard with good privacy. In the toilet, there are tables and chairs outdoors. If you don‚Äôt want to go out to eat, you can order takeaway or bring your own induction cooker, barbecue pot, etc. On the first night, we had Chinese food at the hotel for dinner. The price was similar to that outside, and the taste was okay. There is a lake between the RV camp and the hotel. You can ask for a boat to pick you up when you go to have breakfast. This is a free service provided by the hotel. After breakfast, on the return trip, you can drive a boat at the pier and swim the lake. The children are very happy. The hot spring pool in the hotel is specially for children. In short, this experience is very good, and I will come next time.

The service ecology of the green room on October 5 is very good, and the waiters in the V1V2 room of the Chinese restaurant on October 6 are also very good. Alice, the housekeeper of the three-bedroom villa, responded quickly and had a good attitude. She also gave us a box of Zengcheng tofu flowers for everyone to have a good experience. Special thanks to the staff of Le Shui No. 1 Kayak Paddle Board for your hard work. Even in the peak period of fun, they take the trouble and do their best! Worth recommending!

msg:I didn‚Äôt plan to write a review at first, because I felt a little uncomfortable, but then I thought about it, now that the hotel staff Alice and Coco worked hard to remedy it, I don‚Äôt have to worry too much about it: Let‚Äôs say that I queued up to 3 at 2:30 in the afternoon. When it was my turn to check in, a slightly fat male receptionist took less than five minutes to check in for me, wondering why others need so much time but I don‚Äôt need five minutes. I went up to the room happily, and immediately poured it down like a basin of cold water: the room for me was the worst corner room 5025, the roof was slanted, and the room area was small. I asked the waiter next to him, and the waiter informed me of this room. It's a mountain view room. I asked me to call the front desk and say that I booked a Hushan room. I used the phone in the room to call and found that the phone was broken. I was in a bad mood at that time. Fortunately, Alice helped to transfer to Room 5016. The room attendant was kind and thoughtful, which made me feel better. In addition, Coco sent some souvenirs to comfort me. The next morning he also sent a message to remind me of breakfast time. The remedial attitude was positive.
The entire hotel facilities are still very new, there are many amusement items, it is a good place to take children to play, the natural environment of the hotel is beautiful! But please strengthen the professional attitude of the staff at the front desk and the catering depar**ent of the hotel.

Facilities: The swimming pool surrounds the villa. You can swim anytime and anywhere. Guests can play boats for free.
Service: The service is really first-class. Special thanks to Xiaolian. The service is very good and she helped me clean the hot spring pool in the room.
The next day, when we were having breakfast, there was no place for us to sit because there were too many people having breakfast. The supervisor, Huahua, was very helpful and took us to the room. Every guest has a customer service person. My customer service name is Bingbing, and his service is super good.
Price: My room on the 7th was 1188. If it's not a holiday, it should be cheaper to book in advance, and there are also live broadcasts.
A very suitable place for taking the elderly and children on vacation. like

You can sleep five people in one squeeze. The sofa bed in the second bedroom of the RV is not very comfortable. The toilet shower is small but understandable. The RV sparrow is small and has all the internal organs. There are wash basins, foot-flushing taps, showers and toilets in the yard. Equal to two bedrooms and two bathrooms. The swimming pool and hot spring pool in the yard are very convenient. There are desk sockets in the yard too. The hotel‚Äôs "Leshui No. 1" can dive and trampoline diving, which is very fun.

There is no need to line up from check in to check out. It is very convenient for the car to park directly at the gate of the yard. The manager Ye and the housekeeper Xiaohe provide a good service and give a lot of warm reminders. They also help carry the luggage into the car. The exclusive housekeeper can almost do whatever it takes. It's on the go, it's great! Because there was a child‚Äôs birthday that day, the housekeeper also helped set up the RV, and the child was very happy. There are many amu*****t facilities on the opposite side of Le Shui No. 1, and there is not enough time to experience them all. Except the toilet smells a bit, the rest of the caravan is very clean. The dinner buffet is crowded and it is difficult to find a place to sit, other than that, the others are very good. There are still many projects under construction behind the hotel. I believe that the next time I go there will be a different experience. It must be 5 stars.

I personally recommend that you check in after three o'clock in the peak season to be more reliable and to avoid unpleasant and disturbing things. What is more surprising is that although the room is full, the swimming lanes and hot springs feel that there are not too many people, and they are generally more comfortable. The Chinese and Western restaurants are very good. The Mid-Autumn Festival buffet dinner purchased by Ctrip is very good value for two large and one small. There are fireworks in the evening, which surprises me! There is an orchard not far from the hotel where you can pick grapes, which is very suitable for families and children!

Check-in arrangements are quick and efficient. The lobby manager is also very enthusiastic and added WeChat. During the period, there are questions and answers, and the service is very good.
The room I stayed in is on the top floor of the fifth floor, in a corner, with a big balcony, towards Baishui Village, and there is a hot spring pool, which is very large. It is a pity that the room is relatively closed, and there is no view in the room, which is very boring. And the top floor is very hot, and you can't get out of the balcony during the day, it's too hot.
The hotel‚Äôs entertainment and leisure facilities are very rich. There is a large and beautiful lake. Except for helicopters and deep diving, everything else is free. I really feel good. The environment is also very beautiful and comfortable.
The buffet in the evening was also very good, 388 two of them can be considered worthy of the price. The overall feeling is pretty good, next time I bring the baby back

msg:The package vouchers bought by Ctrip, which are considered to be very discounted, are actually changing the items to confuse the choice. The package includes breakfast and evening buffet + hot spring room. I thought that the public indoor swimming pool and hot spring pool outside can be played together (fortunately, I did not change my swimsuit, I went to consult first), it turns out that this package cannot participate in indoor projects and public hot springs, and can only play in the outdoor long swimming lane. Children still like this long swimming lane, but it‚Äôs too sunny in summer, so they come out to play at night. Fortunately, in the off-season now, there are not many people, and people of all sizes can come out to play and swim at night. The water is not very deep, but adults can swim. There is a rule for young children to wear safe clothes. The hotel can rent a swimming ring, which can be regarded as meeting the different swimming needs of people of different sizes.
         The hot spring pool in the room, the water quality is very good, the skin feels slippery after soaking, this must be praised üëçüëç. There are two pools in the room, one for adults and one for children. You can only soak once during your stay. Since the public pool outside cannot be used, the room can only be used once, and there are no simple activities to go in the hotel. In the afternoon, we slept in the room to hide from the sun.
      The duplex room booked is very well designed. There are separate toilets and shower rooms on the upper and lower floors. The bed is 1.8 meters downstairs and the tatami is 1.5 meters upstairs. The design and hygiene are very good. After staying in the hotel, I came to the hotel twice to give gifts of fruit and milk + small dolls. Just when I fell asleep, I knocked on the door to deliver things üò£ was also very helpless to open the door. üôàIt is recommended to bring them in together when checking in, so as not to disturb the guests' rest. After checking in in the hotel lobby, the room was a little far away from the hotel lobby. We got lost in the open aisle. I met a lady of customer service who had a great attitude. She led us all the way to the room. After introducing the room, she helped us check the room. Status, introduced the room situation, the service is very attentive, give her a thumbs up. Now the room card is just a bracelet. The room power supply, door opening, and dining confirmation are all connected to the world, haha.
       The room I lived in happened to be blocked by a large roof, and there was no view outside, and the opposite was a new project under construction. Was woken up by construction at 6 in the morning. When I checked in, I saw the gift earplugs on the desktop of the room, but I didn‚Äôt notice it. It meant this üò¢. According to the observation, there are some hydrophilic rooms near the 1‚É£ open-air long waterway, and the open-air waterway can be seen from the balcony of the room. 2‚É£The duplex parent-child rooms are basically on the first floor, and the door of the room is also near the waterway. 3‚É£ Some other room types need to take the elevator upstairs, and downstairs is the waterway. 4‚É£The villa area is a little far away from the outdoor waterway. You need to walk a few tens of meters, but the villas basically have a swimming pool and hot spring pool function, so I don‚Äôt want to join in the fun.
        There are still some new projects under construction in the hotel. It is estimated that after one or two years, you can choose to come and play again. According to the introduction, the hotel is building two indoor large-scale water park projects and one project for catching fish and shrimps. Now the hotel has its own dock, where you can take a helicopter to watch the White Water Village up close, dive, kayak, and take a boat trip. Suitable for friends who like to stimulate projects to participate.
       The hotel‚Äôs breakfast and dinner buffets must be liked üòã. There are many varieties, and there are many service staff. Both the cooking dishes on site and the waiters responsible for cleaning are very diligent. During this trip, the buffet is the most satisfying for the family. Two connected buffet dining areas, the environment and food are superb üëçüëç.
      The hotel has large open-air and indoor parking lots. The hotel is a ten-minute drive from Baishui Village. There are also many farms in the surrounding area, and there are so many choices to pick fruits and eat. The hotel has a small farm on its own, and you can also experience it. The ducklings like to follow people and interact with each other from time to time. It's just the season for fish release, and the hotel sells mountain spring water fish. As a whole, it can be seen that the hotel‚Äôs setup and layout are very attentive. The scope of the hotel is very large, and I am looking forward to the opening of new hotel facilities.

msg:There are many water activities in the hotel, which is very suitable for bringing children over for vacation. The room has a hot spring pool. There is an additional charge of 98 yuan per person for water entertainment, 1988 yuan per person for helicopters, and 198 yuan per person for off-road vehicles. The water charge project should be contracted, the service attitude is particularly poor, I am impatient to ask anything, and even bother to answer. The child wanted to take a boat, and said that everything was broken and he could not take it. He urged him to hurry up when he thought about which event to play. It‚Äôs fine to come out on vacation to be happy, but the price can‚Äôt match the service, it needs to be strengthened training and improvement!

Surrounded by fish, the large terrace on the second floor is a soaking pool, but the drain of the pool is leaking, and there is no way to fill it up when the water is discharged. Finally, I gave up...The water house has its own private dock, and the housekeeper can directly ask the ship to come. Pick up and play in the water park.

msg:Details can be seen everywhere in the hotel room decoration. Even the lighting design is amazing. The hot spring is too enjoyable when entering the house. The glass and door soundproofing equipment is particularly good. It is definitely a leader in the hotel industry.
The Chinese restaurant's products are also above the standard. The pigeon skin and crispy meat are amazing and worth a little. The buffet breakfast has a lot of types, but the exquisiteness is not enough. Perhaps because of the locality, the western dishes cannot be compared with Guangzhou, especially the coffee beans; There is an afternoon tea time in the afternoon, and there is an afternoon tea group purchase for just 18 yuan. The selling is good and the price is very high. The children like it, but it is still an old problem. The coffee beans are not good, and the whipped cream is of poor quality. It's delicious üòÇ!
The design of the slide in the hot spring area is very creative, and adults find it exciting and interesting. The indoor swimming pool and hot spring spa area are really great. There is no need to worry about nowhere to go on rainy days.
In the package, an electric boat tour ticket is given, which just allows the second and second elementary school to ride. The boat is really comfortable when the sun sets in the evening, and it is also the most unexpected surprise of this trip.
 Forest Sea is a good hotel that will keep guests reminiscent and want to come back again. The services in all aspects are also very attentive, and I look forward to more preferential activities.

It also includes four adult water park tickets. It feels cost-effective, the environment is very good, the lake is very clear, and the water in the water park It is also directly connected to the lake and the mountains and rivers, which are very beautiful and directly reach the bottom. There is a plank road from the campsite to the hotel to have breakfast. It is not as inconvenient and far as others said. The swimming pool is mountain spring water, and the bathing pool is real hot spring water. It feels great. However, because we stayed in the Internet celebrity room, the sofa inside was a bit worn out, and the maintenance of the facilities needed to be improved, especially the sunshade on the hot spring pool was broken and the new one has not been brought over. The facilities in the room cannot be compared with the rooms in the villa area, but the sanitation is good, and it is really good as an experience room type.

First of all, there is no big problem when checking in, just queuing (the power of the Chinese + the hotness of the hotel)

Soon the young lady at the front desk took us to the splashing villa, as shown in the picture: it is next to the swimming lane, invincible and convenient, and the visual effect is good.

In the evening thinking about how lazy people can go to eat, I bought the hotel buffet dinner before 3pm, and it‚Äôs half price for seniors over 65 years old... This promotion hit the first generation of our team in seconds (because this trip is Three generations in the same house), the third generation of my family is not enough, so feel Âõñ~~

Who knew that the dinner produced was as good as Anna from the catering depar**ent, and cured our 9+2 seats and Guangzhou stomach. It is especially recommended here that if more than 6 people travel, remember to go to the restaurant and communicate with the restaurant before 6 pm to ensure that all families, men, women and children can quickly get a seat.

Soak in a hot spring after dinner, come to a "Bali" spa, the comfort level is comparable to a five-star enjoyment

msg:I wanted to go to the forest sea last year, but I missed my appoin**ent due to the epidemic. This year I finally made a trip with my friends. Star rooms are the most popular in several themed rooms. The room on the 3rd floor is big enough, better than the 2nd floor. The children team up to play games in the room every day after dinner. After playing indoors, they change their swimsuits to soak in the water. The balcony is big. The pool also benefits the elderly who don't want to go to the swimming lane. It‚Äôs a pity that we didn‚Äôt have a fun water package in our room. Later, I bought packages separately for water parks, cruises and hot spring areas. I played four water tools by myself. I also tried kayaking with my kids. The bumper boats are very good. It's fun, playing fish makes children very happy, life-saving equipment is quite adequate, adults and children are very satisfied. The hotel‚Äôs food and beverage taste is also good, the environment is good, the styles are many, the price is fair, and there are also takeaways nearby, which is very suitable for short-term vacations. When I finally left, I was a little bit reluctant to leave. Many friends also planted grass for my pictures and booked a room right away.

From the time of arrival at the hotel, they line up and wait for check-in. The garbage is cleaned up in the room and placed at the door. The smell is unpleasant, the room has just been cleaned underground and there is still water! The cleaner's mask is still placed in the room, next to the room, during the renovation project, the room is all decorated with the smell of paint! Hook the machine outside and start working at six or seven in the morning! It really doesn't make people rest. For a five-star price, I was going to come for leisure and health care. In exchange, I lived in the construction site, smelled the paint, and listened to the excavator working. How could the hotel be worthy of the guests who paid thousands of five-star prices! Are you arranging your time to fight for money completely unreasonably!
Let‚Äôs talk about the service. It‚Äôs the same to pay for room reservations. Why are the rooms booked by Ctrip arranged in corners? I am a frequent customer at Ctrip. A five-star hotel with a corner room and an adjacent decoration environment. The quality of service is very poor. The swimming pool is called a water change. The room is called after queuing around 2 o'clock. The cleanliness is poor, and the water is changed. People, many times did not come, just went back to the room for dinner and changed it after 7 o'clock! I'm drunk too, do you still swim? The next day, soaking in water and leaving! How can your hotel be worthy of the five-star price given by the customer! ! Ctrip's hotel reservations are all corner rooms for customers, how can you maintain your customers! !
The price/performance ratio this time is terrible! not worth! not worth!

I heard that it is necessary to book a long time in advance to have a weekend paddling villa. Maybe I am lucky, and I can book it a week in advance üòú
It took less than 1.5 hours for Guangzhou to drive past. There were security personnel at the door to help receive and carry luggage. Inadvertently added the security captain‚Äôs WeChat at the door. I enthusiastically recommended the park‚Äôs route plan and restaurant information. At noon the next day, I asked if I would help with luggage. The service was very good. It was the first time I met the hotel security staff so caring.
Whether it is dining or various places, swimming lanes, hot springs, the service staff are very caring. In the hot spring service staff from time to time inquire whether to drink water to replenish water, not only greet, but also often ask around with water; also the restaurant staff, may see me with a child or a pregnant woman, very enthusiastic to help take food, condolences or something.
Environment, clean. The swimming lane is clear and blue, and there are lifeguards within 50 meters, which is very good. The hot spring area also frequently changes the water. It is estimated that it is expensive because of the high maintenance cost, but it is really clean and reassuring to play.
Room: A three-bedroom villa is booked. The room is very large. The first floor is a living room plus a living room and a room. The second floor is a room plus living area. The third floor is a large room, but the third floor has its own 2 hot springs. In the pool, on the first floor, the door is opened and the lane is down. However, it is a pity that the bathroom on the first floor deodorizes a bit badly, which is greatly discounted. I didn't expect that the facilities began to deteriorate after more than a year of operation.

msg:The environment is pretty good, this time staying in the room type is a paddling suite, you can go down the swimming lane directly, and you can also have a hot spring in the room. The water in the swimming lane is very shallow, which is very suitable for children to play in the water. The service attitude of the staff is very good, and the hotel is very suitable for family trips. It would be nice if the price could be cheaper, and I would go again if I had a chance.

msg:The internet celebrity resort hotels around Guangzhou took the time when the epidemic had just ended. The day of check-in coincided with a full room, and there were crowds of people when they arrived at the lobby. Fortunately, the front desk was very efficient, and you didn't have to wait too long to get the room card. The attitude of the service staff is very good. Although the crowd is very busy, they will treat every customer with a smile and patiently answer the questions raised by the customers. The outdoor swimming pool and swimming lanes are the highlights, creating an a**osphere of a hydrophilic holiday. As it is a new hotel, all the facilities in the room are new, the beds are also very comfortable, the hot spring pool in the garden has plenty of water, and the privacy is good.
Disadvantages: When the front desk is crowded with people, it is recommended to set up a single line to wait, which can prevent some families from waiting in multiple lines at the same time and treat each customer fairly. The breakfast restaurant recommends that customers wait in line outside the restaurant, and then let the staff lead them according to the vacant seats in the hall, instead of letting everyone rush to find seats.

msg:There is no drain in the toilet and the floor cannot be washed, so a cleaning spray is used to cover up the odor. The water park amu*****t project has not been completed and is not open, and you can't play it even if you want to pay. Then the price is a bit expensive and the experience is very average.

msg:Apart from a large swimming pool, the hotel does not have many places to play. There are a few small pools in the hot spring area, which are still under construction. I used to go to Qingyuan, where there was surfing and a water park.
The main bubble pool is 100 squares, so I won‚Äôt play for a few minutes
Hotel breakfast is ok
If adults like hot springs, they can go to experience
