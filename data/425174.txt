msg:The most satisfying hotel in the first half of the year, no one else.
Formerly the Oriental Business Hotel, it was rebranded as a high-end brand under Huazhu. It was beautifully renovated. Paintings can be seen everywhere in the lobby, elevator hall, restaurant, corridors, etc., which is very design-oriented.
The location is super good, with a first-line Bund river view. Cross the road to the Jinling East Road Ferry, and take a ferry for 2 yuan to Pudong. It is about 500 meters to Shiliupu Wharf, where you can take a boat to cruise the Huangpu River at night. It is also about 500 meters away from Yu Garden (Chenghuang Temple), so you can go shopping together. It is 1 kilometer to Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street. You can get there by strolling along the Bund from the hotel. It is also very convenient to take a taxi to the Shanghai Natural History Museum in 10 minutes.
The fairy at the front desk came to communicate the check-in matters in advance. When she learned that I would arrive at the store in advance due to a temporary change of itinerary, she was very considerate to help me make notes, and finally checked in smoothly. The front desk also upgraded the room type, which was really a surprise, and I decisively applied for a membership card. The hotel staff is good-looking, has a good attitude, and responds promptly. The cookies given upon check-in were delicious (my kid shamelessly asked for them the next day).
Corner Room 06 is a popular room type. It can see the Bund, the Oriental Pearl Tower and the three-piece suite. The interior decoration is comfortable and textured (much better than the weird style of the Bund Indigo next door). There are gyms and laundry rooms. Meilu Restaurant is worth a visit. The afternoon tea is very cost-effective. There are coffee, tea and fruits in the lobby. Even the elevator entrance has benches and bottled water for rest, which is very considerate.
The hotel is about 500 meters away from Metro Line 10. There is no parking lot. It is recommended to use public transportation. If you really need to drive, you can park at the nearby Bund parking lot.

As a result, the afternoon tea provided only had a cup of coffee and a biscuit. The attitude of the waiters and front desk was extremely bad. I made a stink face when I said this was all I had. I called and communicated with the front desk many times, and finally sent some snacks after confirming many times. In addition, there was no welcome fruit in the room. I am grateful for the price and such a service attitude. I will continue to do so in the future. Don‚Äôt order it. It‚Äôs really terrible.

The location is excellent. In front of the Jinling East Road Pier, you can walk along the river to enjoy the beautiful scenery.
Disadvantages: In the room 1. There is a lot of dust under the bed. I found it when I picked up my slippers and was disgusted. 2. The shower room has no privacy glass and is completely unobstructed, with poor privacy; the corners of the bedside table are very sharp, and it will be very serious if you accidentally hit it. It is recommended to add a sharp corner protective cover. 3. There is no signal for the live broadcast on the TV (maybe only my room is broken), and you have to pay to watch the Internet TV. It is a waste of such a large TV. Not everyone can cast the screen, which is not friendly to the elderly. 4. The breakfast area is very small and not rich enough. 5. I asked Ctrip customer service in advance to help me contact and arrange a room with a better view. As a result, I was given a room in the corner area. Half of the windows were blocked by the building next to it. I came for the river view. At this price, the service has no butler service hardware, no swimming pool, no free parking garage (the Bund parking lot is 16 yuan per hour and the cap is 128 all day), plus the previous shortcomings, I was extremely disappointed.

msg:The overall feeling is pretty good. After all, given the price, it turns out to be some kind of hotel in Deutsche. It must have been renovated in cooperation with Huazhu? The exterior and the interior of the lobby feel quite new, and the rooms are quite big. After all, land is very valuable in Shanghai, and it is very close to the Bund. There is a ferry station across the road, a bus station at the door, double-decker buses, and the subway. The station is not very close. You still have to walk for a while to get out of Yuyuan Station. There is a little brother at the door to help carry your luggage. The room is generally okay. The bathroom feels like it's not a young hotel. The washbasin has a smell and can be yellowed, but there are no other problems. The slippers seem to be of average quality. I feel they are not in line with the hotel's positioning. The inner layer will stick üòÇ The set meal for the advance tour did not include breakfast, so I didn't go to the restaurant. The service was still very warm, and baked cookies were given as a gift when I checked in. Biscuit, although the floor is high, the elevator is also very fast. Overall, I am satisfied. There is a small episode when checking out, but it is not a big problem. If there are activities and suitable prices, local dogs will still stay there again. See you again when we are destined.

You don't have to squeeze in with people, and you can enjoy the river view in the room! The river view room has a good view, and it is a painting when you look out from the window.

Downstairs is the International Building Complex. It is very good to see the buildings and learn about history!

The room decoration is the popular new Chinese style. The walnut color finish furniture in the room and the beige marble in the bathroom give people a comfortable and peaceful feeling. The operation panel of the bedside table is placed in a very good position, which is more convenient to operate than traditional hotels. You only need to raise your hand to operate it, which shows the carefulness. The room is equipped with electric curtains, which is very convenient to open and close.

The fruit in the lobby is delicious. Every time I pass by, I eat it. It feels better than what I buy myself. Sure enough, things are delicious when they are from other people's homes! In short, it is a very pleasant experience!

Just across the road is the cruise entrance of Jinling East Road. It is very close to the Bund, which is very suitable for children or the elderly. Because there are many people on the Bund, we did not squeeze the crowd. We can enjoy the beautiful scenery of the Bund directly from the hotel window, and next to it is the International Building Group. Speaking of breakfast, I think it's average and there is no problem with eating, but it is still different from a five-star hotel. It is better than Orange Crystal and the like. Secondly, the service. I called the front desk to discuss the delay of check-out to one o'clock. After talking for a long time, it was only delayed to 12:30. The delay service is slightly lacking compared to the Kerry Hotel that took the initiative to extend it to two o'clock in the afternoon. It is a peak holiday period and it is crowded. Why can other hotels do it? Other conveniences are OK. The sea view room we chose rose to nearly 3,000 per night during May Day. Generally speaking, it feels like a higher-end Orange Crystal Hotel. It is recommended to come on weekdays. It will be much more cost-effective.

msg:After playing in Disney, I went to the city to stroll around. I chose this hotel near the Bund blindly because I saw that it was just renovated in 2023. I felt good after reading the reviews. I didn't expect it to be so great.
First of all, the location. The Bund is right outside the door, and the ferry terminal is opposite. You can take a ride for 2 yuan and check in on the opposite side. You can go to the river bank to see the night view at any time (although the clouds were too thick and the fog was too heavy when I went there).
Secondly, the environment. The hotel lobby is bright, high-end and fragrant, tea and fruit are provided, and the service staff are enthusiastic. The room I booked was temporarily repaired and changed to a suite. The area is not small, clean and hygienic, and children's products are provided. You can see the river view in the room, the dry and wet are separated, the bath water pressure is high, and the drainage is transparent.
Again, I especially appreciate the beautiful lady at the front desk, Duanduan. When I ordered takeout at night, I wrote the wrong room number. Because I was outside, Duanduan promptly found the reason and arranged for the delivery. She was very patient and had good service. Thumbs up! üíØ
Finally, if I have the opportunity to come to Shanghai again in the future, I will book this hotel again. I especially recommend it! ! !

I brought my mother here because she has difficulty with her legs, and all the service staff took care of her meticulously, especially CiCi, who was busy running around and even upgraded the room for me. It was really beautiful and loving. I really think everyone must come to this hotel to experience it, and you will feel warm and loved. Maybe this is what a city of reinforced concrete should look like.

I originally booked a regular room~ I paid extra to upgrade to a river view room~
The front desk gave me a popular room, and I was stunned by the view when I entered!! It's amazing!! The money was not wasted
The location is amazing
‚ë† Opposite the Oriental Pearl Tower, Lujiazui 3-piece suite, downstairs across the road is the pier, 2 yuan to the other side, take a Lujiazui sightseeing bus for a tour. .
‚ë° 3 minutes walk from Wanguo Street!!
‚ë¢ Finally realized the scene in the TV series~ Sit in the room and drink a glass of wine~
Appreciate the night view of Shanghai!! It's amazing!
It's convenient to bring children out!
The night view of Lujiazui opposite the 8th floor I stayed on is amazing!

The hardware of the hotel is not particularly good! But I think it's enough!
The service is super good~ impeccable! !
In short, I am super satisfied with my stay! ! Highly recommended

The location is very good, right next to the Bund, and it is also convenient to go to Yuyuan subway station

Areas that can be improved:
Room hygiene: There are hair and unknown dirt on the floor, hair on the bed, and hair on the protective pad
Service:
I called in advance to inquire about the order information. The lady who answered the phone told me that she was busy now. I replied whether I needed to call back later, and the lady said no; when I told the lady the approximate check-in time and asked if there was a clean room available at that time, the lady replied that I would arrange one for you first (the tone of this "okay" made me feel that my arrival time of 3 pm was unforgivable early);
The front desk and lobby staff did not take the initiative to greet, and almost no smile;
Room facilities:
Remind guests to lock the door, but the anti-lock is broken. After the air conditioner in the room is completely turned off, there is still noise coming from somewhere (maybe the hotel's air conditioner outdoor unit/or the sound of the elevator)

It is not easy to express the real experience in a low-scoring way without a big environment.

The hotel's hardware is really good after the renovation, and the location is very nice.

It's very easy to walk out to the International Building Complex. I went out for a walk at night and again during the day. It was very convenient. If you have time during the day, you must walk to the Suzhou River, where there is the Waibaidu Bridge, and it is very beautiful to take pictures.
The most cost-effective hotel nearby!

This time we also chose the beautiful Bund River View Room. The room is spacious and comfortable, with a view of the Pearl Tower and a panoramic view of the Bund.

The overall service level of the hotel is high, and the waiters are always careful with our large and small luggage, especially my daughter who brings her valuable golf equipment to the game.

When you arrive at the lobby in the afternoon, the front desk will also deliver freshly baked homemade cookies, which are just right with the free coffee in the lobby.

If you need any supplies, the hotel's robot will basically deliver them to the door of your room in a few minutes, which is efficient and hygienic.

This time, I would like to express my special thanks and praise to Janice at the front desk. She was on vacation on the day we checked in again, but she still remembered that we were coming back that day and specially ordered the kitchen to send fruits and ice cream for our daughter, which was very considerate.

I have been to Shanghai countless times. Compared with another hotel I stayed at on the Bund, Royalton Hotel is much better. I will definitely stay there again next time.

Finally, thank you to Linda for sending us a care package when we checked out.

The location of the hotel is great, the night view is beautiful, and it's very comfortable to take a walk along the Pujiang River
The breakfast is quite good, with rich choices, and the simple afternoon tea is average
It‚Äôs nice to listen to the resident singer and drink some cocktails after eight o‚Äôclock.
The whole place must have been renovated, so the rooms are quite clean and new. The bathtub is relatively deep and very comfortable to take a bath in.
The only drawback may be that there are some issues with the design of the shower room. The front desk is actively working on it. I will consider coming back in the future.

Unfortunately, the hotel has not turned on the air conditioner in this season. After staying for two nights, the room was stuffy and unventilated. (The hotel explained that turning on the air conditioner in this season would cause colds, which I personally said was acceptable.) The children had nosebleedsü•≤I called the front desk at night, and Sister Xiaoshuang immediately took me to see other room types. Considering the convenience of moving luggage, she kindly helped us change the room on the same floor and said that she could help us move our luggage, which made people feel very warm!

Cost-effectiveness: High cost-effectiveness. The room vouchers purchased by Ctrip come with room upgrades and free mini bar, which is much cheaper than booking through the Huazhuhui app, so it‚Äôs understandable even if you don‚Äôt have an SNP. You can also make two cocktails in the room, which is worth trying.

Location and transportation: The location is invincible. The Bund is right outside the door, and it is not far from Yuyuan Garden. The transportation is convenient and the subway is a little expensive.

Service: It is commendable. The concierge greeted me when entering and leaving, and also gave me welcome fruits. Thank you to the manager cici. I will come again next time.

Among the hotels near the Bund and Huangpu River, it is good value for money.
They gave me a river view room with a view of the Oriental Pearl Tower.
The refrigerator in my room was broken.
They changed me to a better room.

You can walk to Yuwon
The pedestrian street is a 20-minute walk.
It's worth a walk if you go to see the Bund and the Oriental Pearl Tower.

And there is a transportation boat to cross the Huangpu River right in front of the hotel.
It's 2 yuan
It's good to ride the Shanghai Tower and see the Oriental Pearl Tower.

I haven't tried breakfast
Service is good
There are simple fruits on the first floor.
I took it 3 times

Looking at the night view from the hotel room
It was really nice to have a drink

I don't want to go home „Ö†„Ö†„Ö†„Ö†
There is also salt for a half-body bath.

Downstairs of the hotel is the Huangpu River Pier on the Bund. Taking a ferry couldn't be more convenient. It is very close to Yu Garden and Chenghuang Temple, which can be reached in seven or eight minutes. At night, you can have a panoramic view of the Bund night view. Secondly, the hotel environment is also very good, clean and tidy. I have stayed in many hotels with my children. Many hotels and resorts have higher positioning than beautiful, but my children feel very good about this one. Last but not least, the service of the boys and girls at the front desk of the hotel is very good, including the girls who serve in the restaurant. Especially the girl at the front desk, Duanduan, is beautiful, generous and enthusiastic. She originally checked out at 12 o'clock. , I wanted to take a little more rest with my baby, so I was given a room extension until two o'clock. Highly recommend this hotel.

Among the entire row of hotels on the Bund, the one with the best value for money and the best location is the Oriental Beauty. Other ultra-luxury brands are either too expensive or a mess.

CI is right at the entrance on the first floor. It's very convenient. The rest areas on both sides are designed to be simple and comfortable, and you can get tea for yourself.

I checked into a high floor on the 17th floor. Although it was not a river view room, the suite was large and quite comfortable. Two 60-inch units? The TV can project the screen. Watching movies and football games in the evening is very enjoyable. The remote control is shared.

Time flies so fast 10 years ago, but the hotel is still reassuring

The service is Haidilao style. When I walked in, I helped with my luggage, took the kids with me, and gave me handmade biscuits. Check-in was smooth. Families can have a cup of coffee, tea and fruit while waiting in the lobby (free, self-service!!!)

Entering the room, baby supplies were thoughtfully prepared. The rooms have been upgraded, one is a river view room, and when you open the curtains, you can see the beautiful view of the Bund! ! ! We stayed in a total of 2 room types. The family room was at the back and could not see the river view. If you need a river view room, please ask the front desk in advance before checking in.

Also experience the afternoon tea on the 2nd floor, with first-class service and great views. The second floor is also where breakfast is served in the morning.

The cookies we checked in were warm chocolate cookies. I asked a lot of questions and Robin answered them all patiently.
The room type was upgraded for an extra fee. The little brother said it was their Internet celebrity room type. The room was not big, but I liked it very much. The suite I stayed in at the Venetian before was too big and awkward, and I woke up in the middle of the night. After that, I became more interested in the small but beautiful room.

The hotel's hardware, software and services are all top-notch.
The staff are of high quality, warm and courteous. From the guest rooms to the front desk to the restaurant, the staff greet guests politely.
This time I stayed in two rooms for three nights. The package booked by Ctrip was a beautiful Shanghai River View Room, facing the Oriental Pearl Tower. The bathtub on the left is facing the Bund International Buildings. The location and scenery are first-class. You can watch it when you are tired. Take a bath with views of the Bund and river.
Just across the zebra crossing downstairs from the hotel is the ferry terminal (2 yuan to Lujiazui / every 15 minutes) and the cruise ship terminal. Walking straight ahead is the Bund International Building, which has obvious advantages. From 18:00 to 22:00, the Wan Guo Building Complex lights up on time, which is very spectacular.
This trip to Shanghai came because of Hu Ge‚Äôs flowers. This location is only ten minutes away from the Peace Hotel, so I took photos while walking.
There is no difference between the room photos on Ctrip and the actual room. The bedding is comfortable and clean, and every detail in the room is in place. The hotel breakfast is very exquisite and delicious. The most important thing is that there are not many people, and it feels like staying in a high-end hotel without being crowded, so the overall experience is very good.
The videos were all shot in hotel rooms.

msg:A very perfect stay experience! First of all, the location of the hotel does not need to be described in detail. It is in a prime location on the Bund and opposite the Bund Observation Deck. It has incomparable advantages. The hotel is newly renovated and will only open in 2023. Everything is brand new. The day before check-in, Janice thoughtfully called to confirm the itinerary, arrival time, introduce the route, and parking. . . Wait, when we arrived at the hotel that morning, the front desk staff actively picked us up at the door and helped us with our luggage. Janice was attentive during the check-in process and upgraded the room type. We must give it a thumbs up. While I was waiting on the sofa in the lobby, I was given delicious and crispy cookies made by the hotel. There was also tea, coffee, and fruit in the hotel lobby. During the two-day stay, some minor problems arose. Doris immediately led the masters from the engineering depar**ent to help solve the problem. If you have any questions, you can always answer them on WeChat. It feels like you have a private butler service, and we also gave us a gift. breakfast. In addition, the breakfast buffet must also be praised. Although the breakfast room is small, the food is very exquisite. The layout and display are luxurious and stylish, with a strong European feel. The most special thing is that there is a copper rose still, which is added to the side. Drinking it with yogurt instantly reminded me of the thin-tasting yogurt and rose hydrosol I had in Bulgaria. The waiters in the restaurant are very careful, always observing the needs of the guests and providing services. The service of Anna (seems to be her name) Professional and enthusiastic, my daughter especially likes her. Complimentary cocktails, and two extra snacks when drinking at the bar in the evening. The mini bar in the room is fully stocked with drinks, wine and coffee. All in all, because the hotel was so great, the trip to Shanghai turned into a hotel trip. My daughter just lay down in the hotel and didn‚Äôt want to go out, haha.

When I arrived at the hotel, I felt the enthusiasm of the front desk staff. They upgraded to a high-rise river view room and gave me a biscuit baked by myselfüç™, a huge pieceüòÑ. The breakfast variety is not very rich, but the taste is good. It was a good time. Check-in experience, after leaving the hotel and crossing the road, you will reach the Bund. It is not far from Nanjing Pedestrian Street ~ a few hundred meters away. Living here with the elderly and children saves a lot of worry, and it is not far from Yuyuan Garden. You can get there in about 10 minutes on foot~
You can‚Äôt tell from the photo, but standing by the window and looking at the Oriental Pearl Tower and the river view are really close~

The doorman also noticed that the wheels of the suitcase were damaged, so he lifted one suitcase into the car on a rainy day~

It's a newly opened hotel and the shower is old. I'm speechless. the most important! It tastes great! The decoration smell is too strong!
Regarding breakfast, I was quite surprised. The dining area is very small. The most important thing is that for a hotel at your price, the plates are not heated. It is very cheap to buy a dish warmer. It is winter now.
Let‚Äôs talk about the service quality, it‚Äôs pretty good.
So I hope the business can improve the sanitary conditions and replace the shower heads. Don't rush to open the business. Treat it with formaldehyde and ventilate it to remove the smell. Make the dining area bigger, don‚Äôt be so stingy, make the dining area as big as the whole season.

A good experience started with CI when I started to check in. Hot bottled water was served to me. The little brother was enthusiastic and thoughtful and upgraded me to a river view room. The room decoration is rich in old-money wind, and the front line outside the window is unbeatable. The river view bedding is very comfortable, and the sound insulation effect of the room is good downstairs. The busy room is quiet and relaxing. There is a resident singer at the bar on the second floor who serves cocktails to no avail. I ordered takeout three times in the evening and each time the front desk guy personally delivered it to the room. This is great.
Finally, I would like to praise the guest manager Doris. I will choose to stay in Shanghai next time I go to Shanghai for business.

The room furnishings are retro and simple, the space is reasonable and practical, and the TV can also be cast. The staff are well-trained and efficient. They also pay great attention to service details and will actively help press the elevator. The breakfast is simple but complete.

The front desk clerk knew that the soundproofing of the suite was so bad that it had no soundproofing at all. She did not inform me in advance. I could basically hear the sound of the shower in the next room. , and it was very jarring. After reporting this problem to the front desk, there was no solution and I just stayed there. I decisively checked out for one night and left the hotel early in the morning. This hotel really lowered the standards of the Huazhuhui Hotel Group.

If the map is close to the Bund, there are actually many better options at this price.
If you look at the Oriental Pearl Tower from a picture, you can actually only see half of it. The scenery is very ordinary, and it doesn‚Äôt make any difference when taking pictures.
It‚Äôs so average that I didn‚Äôt take a single photo. This is a reminder to friends who want to live on the Bund.

msg:Customers who are afraid of noise and formaldehyde are advised to leave!
There was a serious problem with the hotel management. The duty manager (No. 4.18) was named and encountered a series of problems. Customer complaints were communicated to the hotel duty manager through Ctrip. As a result, Ctrip informed the hotel that there was no feedback on this. Customer service all said that they have never encountered a hotel that completely ignored or failed to respond to customer complaints. The following are the weird things that happened during this stay:
1. Checked in early on the first day. After arranging a room, the sound insulation of the room at the end of the corridor was very poor. You could hear the sound of shower water. We changed rooms at 1:30.
2. The smell of formaldehyde in the new room was so strong that I slept with my hands covered with quilts all night.
3. I moved to another room the next day, and before ten o'clock the beating started upstairs. Video attached. I live on your 11th floor, and the feedback from the back of the hotel is that the restaurant on the 4th floor is being renovated.
We can understand each other and tolerate each other, but a hotel that costs 1,300+/night should not provide such service, nor should it insult the customer's intelligence and refuse to deal with it. In addition, I would like to ask the manager on duty, is your regional director really indifferent to this or are you unwilling to give true feedback?

I will stay at this hotel again - the location is in the center of the Bund, just across the street from the ferry and the stairs to the Bund; the room is spotless and the details are meticulously handled; the breakfast selection is extremely rich, with high-end ingredients, including freshly cut ham, smoked salmon, honeycomb, etc.; The hotel staff are enthusiastic, professional and thoughtful. You can easily borrow an umbrella when it rains, deliver water to your door at any time, and help direct online taxis to carry luggage on rainy days. Lying on the bed, you can see the Huangpu River, the World Expo Group and the Oriental Pearl Tower, which are really beautiful.

The service staff are all polite and enthusiastic. It is a 10-minute walk from Yuyuan Subway Station. The only drawback is that there is no parking lot. You can park underground in the shopping mall next to Yuyuan subway station. I hope there will be parking service or parking fee reduction.

You can see the Oriental Pearl Tower and Huangpu River from the room and bathroom, but there are problems with the facilities and services: 1. The bathroom shower has no hot water. It took a long time to ask the master to repair it, which wasted a lot of time; there is a problem with the bathroom curtains. It was pulled down, but it couldn't be pulled up, and even the master couldn't be repaired, which meant that half of the landscape was missing! 2. My family called the front desk to tell them about this. The waitress at the front desk told my family in a bad tone that the hotel had upgraded us to this beautiful Shanghai River View room. She also asked my family if they wanted to change back to the original room. ? ? ? ! ! ! I would like to ask the hotel management, what is going on? I was not there at the time, and it would be dark when I came back, otherwise I would have asked her to explain on the spot! Is the waitress looking down on me? Did the hotel give me a great favor? When I checked out the next day and told the hotel receptionist about this, he just handed me some souvenirs perfunctorily.
