msg:The Shangri-La hotel is a beautiful hotel located in a prime spot next to the beach. There is a great buzz and range of facilities at the hotel. Overall, I enjoyed my stay, however, there were a few frustrating things. I arrived after the check-in time but my room was not yet ready. To compensate for this, I was taken to the executive lounge and my request for a late check out was accepted. At breakfast the next morning, many of the coffee machines had run out of milk and it took a little while for the milk to be topped up.

I requested a birthday theme for my husband's birthday and they designed the room with some towel, also send a free cake and red wine. ( I have to mention, Thank you dears) 
The breakfast was very delicious. We also tried the Buffet dinner one night, it was very delicious with both choices Chinese and Western.
The swimming pool was clean.

Feedback that chair has sharp edges and cuts my toes. Just simply sent me few pieces of hansaplast and wrapped the chair's legs. Mentioned to front desk, need to check for all rooms' chairs. However check in again 1 week later in the other room, chair was having the same sharp edges. Hotel patrons safety is not prioritized. Went to sauna room, room couldn't be heated. Steam room is down too. Gym weighing machine was out for repaired for weeks and not back. In room iron board is like those very low cost board, it wasnt like a ironing board that a 5 star hotel will provide. In room bottle water is one of the cheapest in the market, not mineral water and just purified water. Front desk service can be one of the worst that I encountered, even 3 stars hotels provided a better service. Car park auto system was horrible too. 50% of the time couldn't exit. Either gotta go back to front desk seek help or pay for parking fee. From above several points, i really couldn't be justified that this is a 4 or 5 stars hotel.

msg:We loved it so much we stayed another night!

Pros: 
- Great service 
- Stunning panoramic sea views 
- Beautiful beach
- Large rooms, comfy beds, large comfy bathrooms and slippers
- The segregated jacuzzi in the changing room area is so relaxing and having the option for swimming lessons is great
- Convenient and good location, close to shopping 
- Highly recommend the balcony room and a higher floor (2014 room was perfect!)
- The rooftop balcony in the horizon club room is great!

Could be better:
- The water bowl for the birds needs a thorough clean and fresh water.  A larger pen would be better for the rabbits health and longevity.
- The quality of the afternoon/dinner food served at the club room needs to improve, the range of beverages and quality of brand need to change to warrant the additional cost of paying for the club

FYI:
- If you’re returning to Beijing make sure to get a nucleic test within 48 hours! Beidaihe Hospital has a convenient testing station opposite the hospital - take passport! I had to return the next morning to get a print out as the app didn’t register our details.

Special mention:
- Thanks to Nick in level 1 Cafe during dinner for his attention to detail, he always ensured we had drinks and things were taken away in a timely manner. 
- Thanks so much to Jordan Wang for providing great service and helping us sort out our return to Beijing and to his female colleague! 
- Thanks to Oliver too for keeping everyone safe on the doors, we appreciated the efficient setup.
- Housekeeping service was prompt, helpful and cleaned very well.

msg:This was our very first stay at Shangri-La where we stayed for 3 nights and our expectations were pretty high. Sadly, even the staff was trying the best, this hotel wasn't what we expected, especially for the money we paid per night. One of the examples is that we asked for the second chair at the balcony, every day of our stay at least once at the reception, but none was delivered even-though it was promised. What I have to balance was the possibility for older kids to have fun: free football field (artificial grass, not very nice but at least something), night cinema, bicycles and so on. On the other side, even we had a balcony, it wasn't cleaned for the whole stay.

msg:At present, the Shangri-La in these cities, except Jinan, is the best service in Qinhuangdao. I brought my children to celebrate Children's Day. Liu Yahui and Wang Jing, who received us on the day of check-in, saw that some children gave him a small dinosaur. The check-in speed was fast and good. At that time, Liu Yahui said to give me a room with a better view than last time. I thought that the area where I could see the sea would be a little larger than the last time. I didn't expect that when I entered the room, wow, it was a room facing the sea! Thank her very much! During the stay, Liu Yahui also helped me solve various problems. When I left the hotel, Jia Ting and Kong Sisi's service was also very professional and good, and they gave me a set of L'Occitane toiletries.
Although I only stayed twice, I left a good impression. It is really convenient. It is very close to eating and the beach. There are small animals to see, amusement facilities to play, and twisting eggs, sightseeing bicycles to ride. It can be said that there are still a lot of things to play. And because it is a holiday, each table can make a lacquer fan for the dinner buffet, and each one is very good.
The only thing I want to complain about is that the buffet is delicious but there are not many options to choose from (the group tour with coupons is very cheap, but it can be more expensive but with more variety). I didn’t go to the Japanese restaurant because I don’t eat sashimi or sushi. Maybe I can try the Chinese restaurant next time.

The transportation is very convenient, and it is very convenient to take a taxi or drive. The big garden downstairs has a very good atmosphere and is suitable for team building. You can swipe your card directly out of the garden to the beach, which is very pleasant. The facilities are quite complete. I live in a sea view deluxe king-size bed room with a large balcony, where you can see the beautiful seaside scenery and listen to the beautiful sound of waves. But after all, the equipment is a little old for some years, but it is very well protected. The service staff is very kind and patient in answering questions, especially the two little beauties Wang Na and Liu Yahui at the front desk, who also gave exquisite souvenirs, which is very considerate. The most praised is the hotel breakfast, which is very rich and suitable for people from all over the world to enjoy. The breakfast is very good. I recommend everyone to try it when they come to Qin. Maybe I stayed here. In addition, I had dinner with my friends at the hotel's Chinese restaurant Qinxiang Pavilion. The two of us ate very well, very good, and the service attitude was also very good.

msg:It was a great short trip. I take my kids to Beidaihe almost every year, mainly because it is close to home. It takes less than 2 hours to get there by high-speed rail. The kids won't feel tired or pressed for time on weekend trips. In previous years, I stayed in Liuzhuang. This time, in order to take my kids to experience a different Beidaihe, I chose the Shangri-La Hotel Qinhuangdao. Because it was my first time staying there, I didn't consider it very well and didn't choose a room with a balcony. I upgraded the room when I arrived at the hotel. It is recommended to choose a sea view room with a balcony, facing the sea... Spring is here. The room is very large, with an unobstructed view of the sea outside the window, and it is also very clean and comfortable. It takes only 2 minutes to go downstairs to the beach, and the kids can play with sand at any time and feed the seagulls with ham sausage. The sea water in mid-May is a little cold, and the temperature is not too high. I really need to bring a long-sleeved shirt these days. The child brought a long-sleeved shirt, and got it wet while playing with the sand. I went to Maoye Tiandi for dinner in the evening and bought one by the way. It is very necessary. It was raining this morning and the temperature was only about 10 degrees. I should be able to go to the sea to play during the summer vacation. The buffet at Qin Coffee on the first floor is also very good, and the children are very happy to eat. I would like to especially thank Jia Ting and Jiang Honglian at the front desk. The service was excellent, which made our stay very satisfactory and made our trip much more convenient.

Hotel check-in is fast~ Hotel service is also very good~ 
Room is quite satisfactory~ Bath water is sufficient~ But the shower🚿space is a bit small, it is not convenient to bathe the child~ The trash can🗑️ is not covered with bags, which has always been something I care about~ But most hotels do not cover with bags~
I had a dinner buffet and breakfast on the first floor of the hotel. The buffet options are not that rich, but the food is good~ I ate a lot of salmon and grilled skewers~ There is a spicy sauce mixed with jelly, which is really amazing 
I am disappointed that the executive privileges on the 23rd floor are not luxurious or not, but the price and privileges are completely mismatched. There are too few varieties and the taste is poor. I had breakfast here on the first day just to avoid the crowds downstairs. The variety is rich and the taste will be better. As a result, it is really... Not as good as the breakfast on the first floor. It is far worse.

Standing on the balcony to see the sea and sitting on the beach to see the sea have different feelings. One is the power of the sea water far away, and the other is the power of the sea water up close. The room decoration is classic and elegant, which is my favorite style. I originally planned to stay for one day, but I didn't expect that my old mother liked to watch the sea in the room, so I stayed for another day. The breakfast is rich and the ingredients are fresh. The tea and snacks in the cafe on the second floor are very exquisite. The front desk and room service are professional and meticulous. I would like to thank Ms. Liu Yahui and Ms. Wang Na for their help. In addition, thank you for the cute dolls given by the hotel.

The mineral water used is ice dew, and the degree of electrification in the room is not high. Except for the large hotel lobby, the other experiences are really poor.

I didn’t want to give a bad review, but on the day of check-out at 11 o’clock, the waiter swiped the card directly without knocking on the door, which really pissed me off! I said, why don’t you knock on the door? The waiter said I heard that you were checking out today, so I came to clean. I really fainted. . . . . .
For a hotel with a price of more than 2,000 yuan, whether it is facilities or services, it is too messy! ! ! ! This is the first time I give a bad review to a hotel, and I am really angry.

After putting down our luggage and making some simple adjus**ents, we wanted to set off for the first attraction of the day. However, we were attracted by the beautiful scenery on the balcony in front of us and could not help but stop to enjoy it.
Thick floating ice has formed on the seashore in February. Not only that, but even the sea surface is covered with ice. This kind of landscape is the first time that we two southerners have seen in our lives. Some people even walk on the ice, as if walking in the sea. The joy and curiosity in our hearts at this moment are like turning people back to the state of mind of children, and we can't calm down for a long time.

Speaking of the afternoon tea here, although the waiting time is relatively long, it is all handmade and it is also a limited edition for the Year of the Dragon. Not only is the price much cheaper than the afternoon tea in the Magic City, but the taste is also very good, which makes us like Qinhuangdao again.

The garden on the first floor of the hotel has an entrance and exit directly to the beach. You can swipe your card in and out, which is convenient and safe. I would especially recommend the food at Qinxiang Pavilion in the hotel. The roast duck with jujube wood was so fragrant. I ate it for two days in a row. The Yangzhi Manna was surprisingly refreshing and delicious. The other dishes were also very delicious and not expensive. This roasted duck is really, really good! !

But the most amazing thing is the hotel itself. The higher the sea view room, the better. We declined the suggestion of the lady at the front desk to upgrade to the fifth floor balcony for free with sea view. Facts have proved that this is correct. Standing high and looking far away, the entire sea can be seen. On the first floor of the hotel, you can go directly to the beach by swiping your room card. I have never seen so many seagulls. You can buy seagull food next to it. How can I put it, I can stay in the hotel all day without going anywhere. My child said that I will come back next time. Live in Shangri-La

First of all, I want to praise that on February 22, at around 9 o'clock in the evening, the little girl who was responsible for checking in was really enthusiastic and contagious. My good impression of Shangri-La instantly exploded. Seeing that we were with our children, she took the initiative to contact the housekeeping depar**ent to send a set of toiletries, took the initiative to upgrade the room, and took the initiative to handle the parking fee exemption procedures for the vehicle. This girl is really worthy of praise. I forgot to see her name. I hope the leaders will focus on praising her.
The service staff I met in the hotel will take the initiative to smile and say hello, which makes people feel really happy. The hotel's training in these basic services is very important to improve the quality of the entire hotel.
The room is also great, and the view is great.
I will go to this hotel when I go to Qinhuangdao in the future.
Finally, I have a suggestion to contact the hotel to set up a takeaway cabinet or robot delivery. It's 2024, and we have to keep up with the times.

msg:I stayed overnight in Qinhuangdao while traveling with my family. When I entered the lobby, the Chinese New Year smell was very strong and fragrant. There were many children's activities. Unfortunately, we were just passing by and couldn't participate. The facilities in the room were not so new but were well maintained. The front desk staff were polite and warm. I liked it very much. I saw a child was given a box of biscuits as a gift. I also gave him a souvenir when I checked out. The room service staff were also responsive and exceeded expectations. The staff were also very enthusiastic at breakfast the next day (staff The attitude is really a plus for a hotel), the breakfast is not that special, it just feels like a five-star hotel standard. The only regret is that one of the rooms smells of cigarette smoke, which is not suitable for people who are sensitive to smells like me. Friendly, but too lazy to change. In addition, the city view room I booked can actually see a little bit of the sea. Haha, it is equivalent to a half sea view room. If I come to Qinhuangdao next time, I will choose Qinxiang!
Warm reminder: My child developed a rash on his face after sleeping. I think he was allergic to the down pillow. It went away after half a day. I would like to remind you that if you have children at home or people with sensitive skin, you can use another pillow~

Choosing Shangri-La is about the service. From check-in to check-out, professional staff provide warm and thoughtful service in every step, which made me feel the warmth of home. Special thanks to two staff members, Ma Mengdi and Zhou Yang, for their help.

The swimming pool is especially recommended. Children love it very much. The maximum depth is 1.2 meters and the water temperature is about 28 degrees. It makes you feel safe and has a lot of fun.

The accommodation in Qinhuangdao was the old Shangri-La, but the result was unsatisfactory, the facilities were outdated, and the toilets were not smart. , the free water provided was ice dew, which lowered the quality. Since it was winter, there were no activities for children, and the lanterns in the backyard showed that the Year of the Dragon was about to come.
However, the front desk staff were enthusiastic and thoughtful, and the service staff on the floor were attentive and considerate, especially the handsome Li Zhiqiang, who helped us adjust the indoor temperature, provided electric heaters to prevent Xiaobao from being cold, and also gave Xiaobao small gifts. The restaurant staff steamed Xiaobao Chicken cake. Guests staying at Shangri-La in winter are advised not to choose a room with a balcony if they are afraid of the cold.

msg:Taking advantage of the New Year's Day trip, I enjoyed the benefits of off-peak travel. In the summer, I was put off by the thousands of rooms in Shangri-La. This time I stayed in a Shangri-La Deluxe Room. It was really good!
On the 16th to 20th floors of the Horizon Club, the lady arranged a room on the 19th floor, directly opposite the sunrise, and enjoyed the privilege of watching the sunrise in the room. Although the check-in time had to wait for more than an hour due to holiday cleaning, it was luxurious after checking in at the front desk. With the pavilion privilege, you can go directly to the luxury pavilion on the 23rd floor to enjoy afternoon tea. Although it is simple drinks and cakes, it tastes really good! The wine happy hour for dinner after check-in can definitely be considered a good dinner. If there are no other special meal requirements, there is no problem in filling up!
Ctrip members can delay check-in until 4 o'clock and check-out. I really like Shangri-La's swimming pool. It's not crowded and is clean and hygienic. In addition to walking on the beach, my baby can only swim in the pool. The biggest gain this time is that I am afraid of water. Learned freestyle with guidance! In short, I highly recommend the Horizon Club in the off-season, with all-day soft drinks and wine happy hour, which can directly cover all meals for two days and one night!

I got up early the next morning and wanted to watch the sunset, but couldn't see anything, so I looked for it. The front desk helped and finally arranged for a sea view room. The view is very good. I am really happy. At least this New Year's Eve is complete. The hotel is only a three- to four-minute walk from the beach. It is very close. There are foreign singers singing in the lobby bar every night until ten It's a little over one o'clock. The gym and swimming pool are also very popular. The food delivery speed in the hotel room is good. However, there was no salt in the omelette on the two mornings, and no salt and pepper were given. It was a bit boring.

I had to go downstairs to pick it up myself. What kind of experience did I get for over 1,000 yuan! ? Old interior decoration? The facilities and equipment should be changed, and so should the thinking. There are many WG friends staying here, but remember, how can it blossom and bear fruit in this land of China? I stay in hotels all year round🏨I didn’t give that hotel such a review, so reflect on it. By the way, the Heyue Japanese food on the second floor is good and worth recommending.

Service: We proactively deliver water every day. It’s quite surprising that there is no fruit plate (although I don’t eat fruit either)

shortcoming:
I don’t know if it’s related to Halloween, but during my three-day stay, someone sang until eleven every night (the singing was really not good!!!). After notifying the front desk, the front desk will coordinate. People who have trouble sleeping are advised not to choose a sea view room. I could hear the sound of singing on the beach on the 14th, 15th and 19th floors.

Through the floor-to-ceiling windows, you can enjoy the magnificent scenery of Bohai Bay and Golden Bay Bathing Beach. The hotel is close to the beach and has a back door directly leading to the beach, making it easy to enter and exit.
Service: Whether it is the front desk, room service, cleaning, concierge, or restaurant, the attitude of the service staff is warm, friendly, thoughtful and considerate. It is also worth mentioning that because I have children, the hotel provides an extra bed for free 🛏️, I must like it.
Activities: The hotel has a rich schedule of activities during the National Day holiday. During the National Day holiday, the hotel has interesting indoor and outdoor entertainment activities, various handicraft classes, physical fitness classes, etc., with different themes and contents, which can make family travel full of color and laughter. Children It was a great time and the staff was very welcoming.
Room facilities: We lived on the 10th floor. The room was well soundproofed, had a great sea view, and the sunset was beautiful. It's a pity that when checking in this time, I forgot to tell the front desk that I wanted a sea view room to watch the sunrise.
 Two suggestions: 1. Ice dew mineral water really stretches the crotch. . 2. The room facilities are a bit old. Some of the wallpapers in the room are warped and need to be tidied up.

This time, it was just in time for my husband's birthday, and the hotel specially sent a birthday cake🎂, which was pleasantly surprised and touched. The hotel's breakfast is also good, with Chinese and Western styles, there are many varieties to choose from; seafood buffet, Friday to Sunday night, 398 per person, all-you-can-eat lobster, very delicious! There is also a free swimming pool (the only regret is that I didn't see the sunrise).

Some suggestions:
1 Some facilities in the guest rooms need to keep pace with the times. For example, the hair dryer is still old-fashioned and should be replaced by a Dyson or similar type; the toilet should be equipped with a fully automatic toilet seat!
2 Singers on the beach will sing until midnight every night. Although the balcony glass door is very soundproof, the singing can still penetrate. It affects your rest too much. The hotel should report it to the government for a solution, it is too disturbing to the people!
3. There are several faucets in the female guest changing room at the Spa that are hot and cold and should be replaced.

msg:Room 2988 for one night. There was no concierge service when entering the hotel. There was no one to help carry my big suitcase. When I checked in, the front desk said that this room type had drinks in the executive lounge until 11 o'clock. When I went there at 10 o'clock, there was nothing. I gave it to them. Two bottles of cans. The room we stayed in was not too big. It faced the beach. People sang on the beach very late at night. In the morning, there was construction work at the opposite construction site very early, so I was woken up. The hotel bathtub was all black and I didn't dare to use it. The toiletries were from L'Occitane. Anyway, it was a frustrating hotel experience. The price is such a mismatch.

It's very convenient to go to the beach, just downstairs, except for the staff who went to the beach to open the door on the last morning, I was very impatient to ask him to help me swipe my card when I went out, and told me to use my room card to swipe, because it is not convenient to go to the beach to get a room card, my husband went to the gym to call He has the room card. The key is that your job is to help open the door by swiping the card? I don’t understand why I’m impatient... Everything else is good. Qin Cafe’s buffet dinner and performances are pretty good, but there are very few varieties of sashimi, only three kinds, and there is no sake, only red and white wine and beer. The waiters are part-time college students, right? ... The table was not collected in time, only empty plates were accepted, and there were three plates of crayfish, shrimp skins, bones and nothing else, so I needed someone to collect the table

You must live in a sea view room with a balcony. It's so cool, love it! The room is very big, I took my two children to sleep on the big bed, the hotel gave the bed around, and my teammates slept on the sofa bed, all right! The bed and pillows are very comfortable, not the kind that are particularly soft! Breakfast is eaten at Qin Coffee in the hotel. The area is small and the variety is medium. The beach is just outside the back garden of the hotel. The water quality is average, but the children are not picky and had a great time! The hotel's swimming pool is 1.2 meters deep and the water temperature is 28 degrees, which is enough for children to play in the water! The hotel is very close to Xigang Garden, Xin'ao Underwater World, Qinhuang Alley, and Maoye Tiandi. It is also convenient to eat takeaway. You can also go to Decathlon to buy a tent and set it up on the beach. There is also a Lawson across the road. Overall, staying in Shangri-La this time is a very good experience, the hotel staff are very friendly, thank you!

￼

Environment: There is nothing to say about the environment, except that the back door is a public beach. The water is very shallow and very safe. Two streets across Fujian is Maoye Center￼, a very large commercial center, with Yonghui Supermarket, Starbucks Burger King￼

Breakfast ￼, ￼can also reach the five-star standard, ￼the service staff is also good￼, the breakfast on the first floor can be eaten outside the house, which is very good￼hmm, but there are still a lot of people￼, it would be better to increase the number of service staff with fewer hands￼ .

Nowadays, many hotels have butlers who keep sending WeChat messages to guests, caring too much, and then asking for good reviews. Shangri-La doesn't have it, everything is served silently, and I like this kind of service.

The locker room is also equipped with a small sauna room, a small steam room, and a small high-temperature bubble pool. The surrounding marine entertainment and dining facilities are also considered complete, and there is also a small market. In the morning, there will be sporadic vendors selling fruits by the sea, which are cheap and fresh. Not far from Qinhuang Alley, the walking distance is acceptable, about 15 minutes. The front desk clerk, Mr. Wang, is very responsible and enthusiastic.

msg:I escaped the 40-degree heat with my family and came to spend a weekend at the 28-degree beach. The room was facing the blue sea view, the sea breeze was blowing on the balcony, and I felt at ease when I heard the sound of the waves. With the windows of the balcony closed, it was quiet again.
Although the room size is not very large, it is very comfortable. The room furnishings are simple and elegant, and the bedding is comfortable for sleeping.
What impresses me the most is the service and professionalism of the hotel. From check-in to check-out, everything is fast and orderly. I live on the 22nd floor and check in directly on the 23rd floor. Jin Yu and Zhou Yang, the beauties at the front desk, arranged the best sea view room. Full of affection. The staff I met during the stay were all enthusiastic and proactive to say hello. If there is a demand in the room, it will be delivered within 5 minutes after calling. In fact, the hardware of most star-rated hotels is not too different, but the high-quality service is easier to impress people. .
In terms of food, breakfast buffet, afternoon tea, and light meals in the evening can all be wrapped in your belly. It is suitable for lazy people like us who are not demanding, and can be done in one step. Might be disappointing for those looking for good food
The location is only 100 meters away from the beach. The sand is clean and fine, and the water quality is average. There are many people on the beach after afternoon. The location of the hotel is relatively convenient, and there are a lot of food nearby, but we haven't tried it much.

There is a 0.5-meter pool, so there is no problem for very small babies. There are small animals in the hotel garden, and there is also an outdoor playground. When the sun goes down, you can walk through the small garden of the hotel to play on the beach. It is very convenient to bring a baby. We are traveling with the elderly and children. We highly recommend staying in the Horizon Club, where you can drink all day long. If the dinner requirements are not high, it can basically reach the level of simple meals. This check-in was very comfortable, and the service was very thoughtful. The lady who checked in, Jin Yu, saw that it was a family and adjusted it to a room on the same floor as close as possible. She also chose a sea view room with a better angle, and returned it before leaving. Two baby toys, must be praised.

Besides, the children are very young, and Aranya is mainly homestay. Therefore, I hesitated again and again and chose Shangri-La. This Shangri-La is the third Shangri-La I have lived in. Generally speaking, it is not easy to have such a level of Shangri-La in Qinhuangdao.
The staff here are very enthusiastic and have a good sense of service. A waiter in the cafeteria who deserves special praise and admiration is very kind to babies and parents. She should be called Wang Longqing, and she is a waitress with shoulder-length hair. She deserves a personal compliment from the hotel. Room service is very prompt and responsive. Just entered the room without slippers. Another thing is that when I first checked in, a little girl at the front desk was irritable, so I won't say more, young people need more training, especially in terms of attitude.
The temperature of the swimming pool is very good, and there are many kinds of breakfast. Although there is a queue, it will not wait for a long time. The Dragon Boat Festival caught up with the fireworks, which is very wonderful!
Generally speaking. It's been a wonderful journey! I recommend everyone to choose Qinhuangdao Shangri-La! ! !

First of all, the overall decoration, environment, and sanitation are not bad, enough for five-star standards. But after entering the room, there are no drinks or snacks in the refrigerator for guests to use for free (all other five-star hotels I stayed in before were equipped). Not to mention the breakfast, which can't even keep up with a four-star standard, and there are only 176 people, and there are very few varieties. There are only two small bars in total, which is surprising. In the peak season, a room worth more than 2,000 a night is really disappointing. And the so-called sunrise room type, you can’t see the sunrise at all, the room is facing southwest, I stand on the balcony, leaning over, and tilting my head, I can’t see the sunrise in the east (this is still to be reserved in advance to watch the sunrise s room). Come to this hotel, if you want to see the sea view, I recommend you, the viewing angle is really good, forget everything else, it can’t meet the five-star standard. Now this kind of five-star hotel chain is really good. Some local five-star hotels only do their own brand and service.

msg:A very happy stay experience😊. When I booked in advance, I mainly paid attention to the surrounding scenery of the hotel. Is it possible to fully experience the scenery of the seaside? I chose this place after careful consideration, and it really lived up to expectations. Once I entered the room, I faced the sea and stood Watching from the balcony~ It's very pleasant, and the sanitation facilities in the room are also in place. I thought that the hotel facilities would have old problems, but there is no problem at all. The experience is very good. The beach line outside the hotel is also clean and beautiful, and the boardwalk makes people feel more comfortable and relaxed. Walking around at sunset will heal your body and mind. Very happy holiday, will come again next time 😘

msg:I want to go to Qinhuangdao. The hotel next to the sea is between Marriott and Shangri-La. I chose the latter, mainly because Shangri-La is close to the city. If you don’t eat in the hotel, there are more choices around, and Maoye Tiandi is far away. Very close, convenient for shopping.
     It may be that there are few people and the procedure is fast, not as slow as it is said on the Internet. The location is really good, and the surrounding environment is also good. It is next to Jinmeng Bay, and after eating, we go to the beach for a stroll. It feels a bit like Sanya. There is an underground parking lot, and the hotel is free. The garden on the first floor leads directly to the sea. Needless to say, the hotel service is as good as ever. No matter the front desk or the room service, they are warm, polite and responsive. There are several restaurants, buffet, Chinese food and Japanese food, 15% discount for hotel guests. The breakfast is relatively simple compared to the Shangri-La where I lived before, but the environment is good and the taste is good. The cleanliness of the room is also good, the bedding is comfortable and big enough, the room has floor-to-ceiling windows, and there are tables and chairs on the balcony. It is very comfortable to drink coffee facing the sea. The room facilities are a bit old, but they are well maintained. The sound insulation of the whole room is a bit poor. Speaking of sound insulation, there was a small episode. I originally chose a balcony room on the sixth floor facing the sea. As soon as I arrived at the door, I heard a painful and happy cry from a woman in the next room. At first I thought it was the sound of the TV, but then the sound became higher and higher. , Seeing the awkward smile of the cleaning lady, everyone understood. When I got to the house, I could hear it more clearly. After thinking about it, it was just like this at noon. If I stayed the whole night, I would not sleep, and decided to change to the room on the tenth floor. Although it is not directly facing the sea, it is not bad to be able to see part of the city.
       Generally speaking, the hotel is quite good, definitely the best hotel in the area, and it is worth coming again.

msg:The location of the hotel is very good. The downstairs is the seaside bathing place. The advantage of the sea view room is that if you think the bathing place is crowded, it is better to lie on the bed in the room and watch the sea. You can also hear the waves and the sea breeze. This time I stayed in the Horizon Club, the experience of watching the sea in the room is great, and there are afternoon tea and light meals in the executive lounge. Although it is more expensive than ordinary rooms, the actual feeling is still worth the money. As a top five-star hotel, it goes without saying that it has everything you need in terms of hardware facilities, and the bedding is also very comfortable. If there is any suggestion for improvement, it is that if the bathroom can be remodeled in the future, it is recommended to separate the toilet and bathtub area. It will be much more convenient. In terms of service, Shangri-La's overall service is still online. Except for the fact that there are many people and the efficiency is relatively low when checking in, the service is generally in place. Before leaving, Ms. Zhang Qiyao at the front desk specially presented a small gift to leave immediately. The store brought us a happy mood and felt the warmth of the hotel. We will come again next time.

Hygiene: I don't know about other rooms. The children's room we live in is very clean, and there is a separate children's washroom, which is also very hygienic.
Environment: The environment is my favorite. It is very quiet and you can hear the sound of the waves. When you go downstairs, you will see the sea and the beach. The children had a great time and you can also see the sunrise and sunset.
Service: From check-in to check-out, I feel that every staff member is very nice and considerate.
Horizon Club privileges (enjoy all-day soft drinks and wine happy hour): There is no problem with the light meals in the Horizon Club, mainly because the view of the Horizon Club is really great!

Hygiene: Hygiene is very good, five-star standard

Environment: When I arrived in Qinhuangdao on May 1st, there were people everywhere. I have to say that Shangri-La is located in an excellent location to see the sea. You can see the sea when you open the door. The weather is also good. The whole family can chat on the balcony, which is comfortable and comfortable

Service: All meals and lodging are in the hotel. The service is very good for three days. However, I would like to make a small suggestion. All the entertainment facilities in the yard need to be consumed. A playful environment and facilities will be more conducive to repeated visits by guests.

msg:I took a family trip on May Day with my family. I came to Beidaihe several times and stayed at the Shangri-La Hotel for the first time. I don’t think there will be fewer people in the scenic area. It’s good to just go to the beach and let the children play. Because it is really inconvenient to go to crowded places with a seven-month pregnant belly.
Sure enough, I did not make a wrong choice. The hotel service is very good and meticulous. Seeing that I am pregnant, I took the initiative to ask about related needs, such as putting anti-slip mats in the bathroom, etc. The cleanliness of the room is also very good, especially pay attention to cleanliness with children. If you book two rooms with the elderly and children, you want to arrange the rooms as close as possible. The view is better. The hotel arranges rooms next to each other on the 20th floor, which is very convenient to take care of back and forth. The high-rise view is very good, directly seeing the beach 🏖️. It is very close to the seaside. There is a small road from the back door of the hotel, and you can swipe your card in two minutes to go out to the beach pedestrian street. It is especially lively at night, but it is far away from the crowds of tourists in scenic spots like holidays.
It is a clean and relaxing trip, very close to the aquarium and shopping malls, and I took my children for a stroll. It is especially worth mentioning that I accidentally ordered a beef noodle from Qin Cafe on the first floor of the hotel. It was so delicious! The taste is very attractive and the taste is very good! It is that the variety of restaurant buffets is somewhat limited and can be enriched. No matter what the weather is this season, I especially recommend this hotel!
The trip is over, and it’s time to go home and prepare for delivery 🙂

A small suggestion, the waiters in the garden and the gym in the morning can be more enthusiastic to the guests. For example, if the guests say thank you, there should be a response. I only raise this feeling for five-star hotels, and I dare not expect everyone to be polite. Also room for a bottle opener would be nice.

The main reason is that the service is very professional and in place, and the waiters respond in a timely manner with high quality. Qinxiang Pavilion specializes in local seafood, Cantonese cuisine and roast duck. The taste is delicious. Seeing that I am taking my children, I even gave away noodles for one night. The hotel has a children's playground, you can play for half a day with your children, and there is a special person to open the door to the beach. The check-in experience is good, and it really lives up to its reputation.

While checking in for us, he introduced us to the room types where we can see the sunrise and sunset respectively. It was so considerate, so we chose them respectively. Sunrise room at 1216 and sunset room at 1201. In the evening, we happened to catch up with the New Year's Eve dinner "Seafood Buffet" launched by Qin Café (with lobster and roasted whole lamb). After eating, you can come out from the hotel's garden gate to the beach. The hotel is too close to the Golden Bay Bathing Beach. It is really convenient to take your baby for a swim in summer. The facilities in the room are also very complete, and there are welcome snacks. Every day the floor attendants clean up very well, and they are very considerate to ask if they need to add drinking water. We lived comfortably for the past two days and enjoyed the feeling of the first ray of sunshine shining on the bed in the spring morning. They also provided us with exquisite small gifts from the hotel when we checked out, and discounted our New Year's Eve dinner when we checked out. It was a great experience. Thanks to the employees of Shangri-La Hotel, Zhao Yue and Jiang Honglian, for providing us with thoughtful and caring services.

Four people went to have breakfast, but they were stopped with a very bad attitude. It means that we pretended to count the number of people eating breakfast, and after checking on site for a long time, we naturally said that there were two breakfasts per room. I never feel that my work is not up to the mark, and I am very proud of it. Totally not up to the standard of Shangri-La, I won’t go there again.

The hotel and the beach after the snow are very beautiful. The first one is the scenery on a cloudy day, the second to fourth ones are the night scenes after snow, and the last few are the scenery on sunny days after snow.
In addition, the buffet and breakfast at Qin Coffee on the first floor of the hotel are also very good, but they just patronized and ate, and didn't take pictures.

msg:On Saturday morning, I suddenly wanted to go to see the sea. I opened Ctrip and saw that the sea view room was available. I immediately made a reservation and was ready to go. Ctrip confirmed very quickly. I haven’t opened the door yet, and the reservation has been successful.
Check in was very fast, and I quickly opened the large French windows when I entered the room. By the way, I ordered a simple meal delivery. The delivery was very fast, and the little brother who delivered the food was also very polite and gentle. The sandwiches are delicious, and while watching the beach, the sandwiches become even more delicious.
Afternoon tea at the Horizon Club, there are many people, very noisy, and you have to wait for a table😂
The dinner in the Chinese restaurant was packed and taken back to the room. It can be said that it was the worst experience during this stay. Fortunately, the manager on duty solved it very well.
Get up early on Sunday and open the curtains, you can watch the sunrise directly. It’s really refreshing. After watching it, go downstairs to have breakfast
I forgot to read the name. When I entered the door, there was a young lady in a gray uniform who was very nice. Seeing that I was taking the old man with me, she took the initiative to help find a place. She specially found us a place close to the dining table, and asked what I needed. Many times during the meal Paying attention to the needs of the elderly, the service is really thoughtful, but unfortunately I forgot to ask her name.
After breakfast, I went for a stroll along the seaside trail and then checked out.
The service of Zara who checked out was also very pleasant. It is polite and enthusiastic without transition. The scale is very good. I asked about the accommodation experience actively. It must be 10086 likes
Overall, except for some small flaws, it is still recommended to stay

msg:🚨🚨🚨Let’s talk about the slots first! ! ! Shangri-La, do you still remember that you are Shangri-La? Get two bottles of ice dew in your room, don't you think it's worth it! ! And the ice-breaking dew can't be unscrewed at all, and the boys have to use a lot of effort to do it! Every time I bite the back molars and twist the water, the tiger's mouth is rough after three days! A water change is highly recommended! If Baisui Mountain can't do it, even Nongfu Spring can accept it! !
💙 location
It takes 20-30 minutes to drive to Qinhuangdao Railway Station, and it costs about 30 yuan by taxi. Next to the hotel is the Aquarium, within 2 kilometers by taxi, the starting price is 7 yuan to the Maoye Shopping Mall. It has everything, very comprehensive, and you can buy anything you don’t bring.
💙Environment
The lobby of the hotel is very grand, especially the large floor-to-ceiling windows when you enter. The sun shines on the sofa area at noon, and the sea view and ice surface outside are beautiful~
The hotel reception is on the 2nd floor. The first floor is a square and garden, with children's facilities, trampolines, small slides, and climbing frames. The charge for electric bicycles, pedals, and bicycles ranges from 58 to 88, and they can only be ridden in the garden. The cost is not low, and Shangri-La seems too stingy! There is an exit in the garden that is guarded, and it is very convenient to go out directly to the beach.
💙 room
We booked room 1214, a balcony sea view room. It is a good location to watch the sunrise, facing east. It is not possible to check in at the hotel at 12:00 noon, and it is only possible to wait until 2:30. Still urged a few times, this needs to be improved. I personally feel that rooms 14 or 15 are good rooms for watching the sunrise.
The room is big enough, the bed is big enough, the bathroom is big enough, there is one collapsed, and the floor-to-ceiling windows of the room are very comfortable to look at. 🚨🚨🚨The trouble is that on the third day I still haven't figured out which switch is responsible for which light🤔🤔🤔
💙Meals
Personally, I don't think it is necessary to order breakfast, and I am not used to ordering it, because it is not in my habit to get up early for breakfast, haha. In addition, you can place an order on Ele.me if you want to eat anything. Coco milk tea, spring cakes, and spicy hot pot can be delivered directly to the concierge depar**ent of the hotel. It is very convenient and arrives in half an hour. Because it is not far from the Maoye shopping mall, which has everything you need.
For Chinese food in the hotel, Dianping has a coupon of 268 yuan for 2-3 people, which is too much to eat at all. However, the waiters in the Chinese restaurant are a bit of a buddhist. If they are not enthusiastic or active, they are almost like tool people, and they feel bad.
💙 Facilities
There are not many people in the swimming pool, the water temperature is 29°C, and the water depth is 1.2m. There are swimsuits, swimming rings and swimming caps for sale, and there are slippers at the door, so you don’t need to bring your own. The men's and women's locker rooms each have a hot spring pool, and the bubbles are very comfortable. 🚨🚨🚨The bad thing is that there are no bath towels in the girls' locker room...there are very few trash cans, which is not good.
💙I was worried about the lack of charging piles this time, so I didn’t drive. But in fact, there are charging piles all over the streets in Qinhuangdao during the off-season. Shangri-La doesn’t have any, but there is a parking lot next to it. There are many empty spaces. According to the local driver, you can charge casually in winter, but you have to queue in summer.
⛱⛱⛱⛱⛱⛱⛱⛱⛱⛱⛱⛱⛱⛱⛱⛱⛱⛱⛱⛱⛱⛱⛱⛱⛱
The overall evaluation is still acceptable, after all, the off-season price of 800 is acceptable

The executive lounge on the 23rd floor is my favorite. You can have a quiet drink. The swimming pool is warm and comfortable, suitable for bringing children in winter The sea has a kind of quiet beauty. Under the seal of ice and snow, there is still an unfathomable world. I marvel at the magic of nature. I caught razor clams with my own hands and took pictures of the seabirds looking for food. The children were very happy.

The room I stayed in faced the west, the sunset was very beautiful, the balcony looked at the fireworks and the coastline, the location was excellent, and the view was great.
I was not very satisfied with the bedding when I checked in, so I quickly came over to change a set. The response was quick and the attitude was very good.
I missed the glasses when I checked out, which reflects the five-star level. I was very cautious. I asked the name and phone number of the person staying in the room, and asked about the style of the glasses. After confirming that they are correct, they can be mailed.

msg:The sea view is really good. Although there is no private beach, the beach is 100 meters from the hotel door, and there are quite a lot of people playing.
During the peak season, it took a lot of time to line up when checking in. The address on the ID card had to be manually entered into the system, and it was also served.
There is nothing wrong with the room, except that the curtains are a bit pulled, the roller shutter channel on the side is often stuck, and the large curtains on the front are still manual, which is very laborious, and it should be replaced by an electric one!
The attitude of the waiters is very good, and the mini bar also delivered a few bottles of drinks, but the sound of the cabinet door was very loud, and I was startled every time I forgot to close the door inadvertently.
There are really many people for breakfast, and every morning we line up to enter the door, alas, who told me that I can't get up at seven o'clock? The taste of the food is relatively poor compared to the Shangri-Las I have been to. The only things I can barely accept are freshly boiled rice noodles and fried eggs-these are also the places with the most people queuing for food.
The fried rice was bad, the sushi was to die for, and the ice cream was okay.
The water temperature of the swimming pool is different every day, and the water depth ranges from 1.2 to 0.5 meters. There is a separate pool for children to play in the water, and the water temperature is slightly higher.
I like the hot spring pool on the side of the men's locker room, you can surf, and the water column massage is very comfortable.
There are many activities for children on the first floor, but you must make an appoin**ent in advance.

I chose a deluxe balcony sea view room. When I checked in at the Horizon Club, the service staff helped to choose a room with a particularly good view. The sea view is invincible. You can enjoy the boundless sea view from the balcony at any time. Haven't seen it for a few days.

Room facilities:
The standard of a five-star hotel is quite satisfactory. All kinds of hotel supplies are online. The toiletries are jasmine from L'Occitane. I like the taste.

breakfast:
On the first day I had breakfast at Horizon Pavilion, I didn't feel the traffic, and the next two days at Qin Restaurant on the first floor, I had to line up to enter at around 8:00. However, there were still many varieties of breakfast, and the replenishment was fast.

Parking is also more convenient, there are ground and underground parking lots, enough parking spaces, free parking. It's a coincidence that the receptionist at the front desk is very thoughtful and considerate when checking in and leaving. I must praise it. The hotel has a lot of content for children to play, indoor and outdoor, and there is an indoor pool for children to play in the swimming pool. Great for vacation.

Moisturizing hibiscus leaves, the spring is still clear.
Xilan divides the color of green, and the tall tree hides the sound of warblers.
At first glance in the wind, the flowers fall more clearly.
Wandering and feeling cold, the moon shadows in the clear night.
Lingling and Bianstone muscle hair, suspected to be Xiao Hansheng.
You can see each other at a glance, one step is like a heavy city.
The love is separated by mountains and seas, and both mountains and seas can be flat.
The thoughts are separated from the clouds, but the flesh is nowhere to be found.
Yugong is no longer seen, and the chief guard weeps.
The gods are still pitiful, who hates them for life.
There are boats to cross the sea, and roads to the mountains.
This love overturns the mountains and the seas, and the mountains and the seas can be levelled.
Can be calm in mind, read without regret.
But you can find what you love and never give up.

She learned that our group was an elderly and child. Although I arrived in the morning, she saw that the room had been tidied up and arranged for us to stay and rest. She gave me a lot of help and made the journey easier. Guests feel warm. In addition, I would like to thank the room service staff of 1710, Li Ming, who found that we were crowded. When the weather was hot, he specially asked us to drink more water and took the initiative to replenish all the spare parts for us. And the hotel customer service girls in the Horizon Club on the 23rd floor are very friendly. All of this reflects the quality service of Shangri-La Hotel, and I will stay here when I go to Qinhuangdao in the future, because it feels like home! I wish the hotel better and better~

It takes 10 minutes to drive from the hotel to Qinhuangdao Wildlife Park, which is not comparable to that of Beijing Daxing, but it can be enjoyed for a long time. Walking down the stairs of the hotel is the beach. You can catch the sea when you go downstairs at 6 in the morning.

It's just a sandy beach, thin and long, full of people,
The sea was dirty, with foam and sea**** floating in the water. These can be said to be congenital defects in the northern beaches, but the children dig sand on the public beach outside the Shangri-La Hotel and were driven away by the people who rented their tents on the grounds that there should be no pits on the grounds of others renting their tents. The man with the chain tattoo looked like he was about to hit someone, and scared the children to flee, as shown in Figures 1 to 4. The hotel said that the beach is public and they can't control it. It's understandable, but it's also the public beach outside the hotel. Only Qinhuangdao's looks bad. The underworld has a sense of sight.
In addition, it is also the Shangri-La balcony sea view room. Picture 5 is in Qinhuangdao, and picture 6 is in Sanya. Let's not talk about how the sea is, just this landscape is quite indescribable...

The view is very good, which makes our stay feel very good, and the children are very happy! Staying in this kind of hotel, I feel that it is a waste of resources to go out and run the scenic spots. The hotel has a lot of facilities that children like, both indoor and outdoor. There is also a swimming pool (with three depths) suitable for parent-child swimming and professional swimming. Children like lawns, football, and go-karts (although it is a bit expensive). I don't know if the front desk clerk who went swimming on the first day looked down on us, why he didn't give us bath towels, and the little brother on the second day was very enthusiastic. Going out from the backyard is the seaside, and there is Maoye Tiandi nearby, which is very convenient for yo-yo shopping or ordering takeaway. The breakfast is very rich and the standard is on the line, just because the popularity is too high in the summer, the environment is a little noisy, and even the wontons, fried eggs and pancakes are often out of stock, and you need to wait for a long time. Seafood porridge, preserved egg porridge and small buns are all delicious. There are many kinds of desserts, and the appearance and taste are good. The secret is: book in advance, book in advance, book in advance! ! !
Daily parent-child activities with different themes: very many and very good

Shangri-La's hair dryer is fixed in the drawer and is fixed lying flat. The accumulated water in the washstand can easily flow into the drawer and wet the hair dryer, causing electric leakage! ! !
Objectively speaking, the only good facility is the hotel's swimming pool, the entire room and the morning part, which is worse than the average small chain hotel! !

Although the variety of buffet dinner is not particularly rich, it is no problem to eat well. The buffet also provides a free grilled fish and a Xishou hot pot for each table. We really can't eat it because there are few people, so we didn't ask for the hot pot. In particular, the oil-splashed noodles for dinner are the best noodles I have ever eaten. The noodle soup is rich and delicious. Room service should also be praised 👍 The shower room was a little splashed out at night, and the housekeeping depar**ent quickly arranged for the waiter to come and clean it up. In the morning, I was in a hurry to eat breakfast, so a lot of changed clothes were piled on the bed. When I came back, I saw that the room attendants had packed them neatly into a big bag.

msg:This time, Shangri-La has refreshed my perception of five-star hotels. The service in the entire hotel is extremely poor! ! From entering the hotel parking lot, the hotel is close to the beach, so the hotel parking lot is similar to a public parking lot. After entering, all the security guards who guide you are ignorant, and even the guide sticks are not on. There is a parking space, and the security guard tells you that you don't know if you can find it without even raising your eyelids. This is the first courtesy when you enter the door. Next, when you walk in the hotel, you will not greet any staff members who will take the initiative to greet you, and you will even rush to the elevator when you enter the door. The hotel’s outdoor children’s facilities without power are also charged extra, such as pedal karts, ziplines, etc., and the hotel’s own children’s playground only has building blocks and sand digging. When you leave the parking lot when you leave, you must pay in advance I have already told the staff that as long as I press the call button, the staff will open the door remotely, but no one responds to the button repeatedly, and I have called the hotel countless times. The staff will only say that I have contacted the security guard, as if the matter has been resolved Finally, there was a huge congestion at the entrance of the parking lot. You couldn't bear it anymore and went back to the lobby to look for the staff. At this time, you will see a staff member on the phone leisurely coming over to open the door of the parking lot. Without a word of apology, just let everyone hang out. More than ten minutes. Speaking of hotel breakfast, there are very few varieties and the taste is extremely poor. The meat dishes are fried items such as bacon sausage and chicken nuggets. There are almost no vegetables, so ask the master to add some vegetables at the noodle stall, just look at the expression of the master who owes him money, and proudly tell you that there are vegetables, and you need to emphasize it again and again before reluctantly rewarding a few small vegetable leaves. Stir-fried vegetables are not available. Seafood porridge has egg flowers floating in it but no seafood. When it is almost time to order, no one asks if there is more food, and the table will be taken away. When you look back and want to get something, you will see that it is empty. I met a few people with children, because they were a little late for two minutes, they were ruthlessly refused to leave the restaurant, and they didn't even give the children an egg. The so-called service is cold and stinking. In short, whoever lives knows. The giant sea here

The lobby bar faces the sea, and it is a good choice to have afternoon tea with music and view: ) We booked a sea view room and opened the curtains to see the endless sea view. The hotel has direct access to the beach, and flocks of seagulls are flying, cooing and waiting to be fed, showing the ability to catch food in the air, adding infinite fun to Qinhuangdao in winter~~ Finally, comment on the hotel's food and beverages, the first floor The buffet can be ordered on the hotel's public account. Now the theme is nostalgic style in the 1980s, foie gras + barbecue + seafood + Japanese food + singer guitar accompaniment, and there is a Shanhaiguan special pot, there are many varieties, I can't say all at once; The Japanese food is also very good, you can self-help, you can order a set menu, you can eat all the way, all recommended~

msg:I went there on November last year, and the impression was not bad. At that time, I felt that the staff's service attitude was very good, so the summer vacation came again. This time I feel a big discount. First of all, the service attitude of the hotel staff does not meet the standards that a five-star hotel should have. They speak bluntly, face tourists with a straight face, and all of them are very naive, which makes me suspect that the waiters are all currently recruited. Second, the Horizon Club is originally an administrative trea**ent, and it should enjoy tranquility and comfort, but it should be in time for the summer vacation. The happy hour at 5:30 in the evening is like a vegetable market. I planned to relax, but such an environment makes people feel that they are not enjoying administrative trea**ent at all. During the meal, there is no waiter asking if you need to drink. There are also many varieties of sashimi. The prices are not cheap this year, but they are all over the top. There is no sashimi at all, just a few simple stir-fried vegetables, salads, French fries, chicken rice, etc. The buffets in our hotel can’t compare; third, we didn’t register our license plate number actively when we checked out, and we need to call the hotel and wait for the staff to come to lift the bar for us at the exit that should have automatically lifted the pole; fourth, we have checked out. It took two and a half hours to check in to the next hotel. When I checked in, I was told that the public security system did not delete the check-in record for us. We had to call back and contact us to delete the information. Fifth, the really expensive room provided cheap ice. Dew mineral water, how bad are you? Anyway, at this price, I won't go again

The changing shower fully considers privacy and shows the level of the 5-star hotel. The most satisfying thing about children playing in the water is the service of the catering depar**ent in the evening buffet, from the foreman Chen Boxin to the senior waiter Sun Tingting, all of them do their best to provide the best service for the guests. I can see that Qinhuangdao Shangri-La is a team that pays great attention to service quality. I highly recommend it.

The door of the hotel leading to the sea should be equipped with a room card function, and many other people were walking their dogs inside. The sanitation of the hotel still needs to be strengthened. I live at 710. The door on the balcony on the inside is so gray that it can’t be photographed due to reflections. I have used Ctrip members to upgrade to the sea view for free, but the floor has indeed become lower. The original room type was above the 16th floor, and now it has been changed to the 7th floor. Hotel breakfast is ok, some local characteristics, but I am not used to eating. There are freshly squeezed juices. Xiangli is now offering ice dew.

This is not available in other hotels; the second is: After check-in, you can send a 300 yuan shopping voucher to spend in the hotel for cash. This I haven't encountered it before. The environment of the hotel is very beautiful, and you can see the sea while lying on the bed. It is a truly sea-view room. You will have a chance to come again in the future!

msg:It was the first time I came to Qinhuangdao and did some homework on the Internet. Later, when the epidemic situation was serious, I chose Qin Xiang. The epidemic inspection in Qinhuangdao is very strict, and so is the hotel. We take our children with us, so we are strict and more at ease. The hotel package is too cost-effective, and I also upgraded the family double room that can watch the sunrise. I opened the window and felt relaxed and happy. The voucher given by the hotel was suitable for dinner at the hotel, and the hotel also sent red wine. The hotel’s own garden can lead directly to the beach, and guests from other hotels around it seem to choose to come here and go to the beach. It may be affected by the epidemic. There are not many people on the beach, and there are not many people in the hotel. It is particularly comfortable. The hotel’s various parent-child activities and facilities are very complete, babies like it, and adults can also lie flat.

msg:I decided to come to Qinhuangdao temporarily and chose between Arcadia and Shangri-La. The evaluations were very good. Because the children like to go to sea, I finally chose Shangri-La. Thank you very much, Miss Jiang Honglian at the front desk, for upgrading the room and helping me solve the problem. In short, I have troubled me several times for all kinds of problems. The balcony sea view room is great. I like listening to the sound of the sea at night. The room also provides the child with toothbrushes and step stools, as well as the buckwheat pillows I need... The child especially likes the ice cream and sandwiches in the dessert bar on the second floor, because time is limited. Going to the swimming pool, I feel very good, next time I come to Qinhuangdao, I will come to stay for a few more days

msg:Shangri-La should be a relatively high-end and authoritative hotel in the local area. First of all, the location, I have to say, it is very close to the sea, and directly leads to the beach through the exclusive garden. You can walk to Maoye Tiandi, see the dolphin show, the safari park, and the Biluo Tower Park, which is a little further away, by car; Good service is a major feature of this hotel. Regardless of the various links, it will actively ask if there is any help, and take the initiative to help with the luggage. It is more compatible with the star hotel. If you pay more attention to some details, it may be more important. Perfect. For example, I have seen people smoking many times in the lobby and elevators of the hotel, and no one stopped it. It’s a bit unreasonable! The overall catering feels quite satisfactory. The food hygiene of the executive lounge needs to be paid more attention to. The level of its food brand needs to be further improved For example, most of the mineral water is Coca-Cola ice dew. If you don’t ask, you can rarely see Evian. But I have to say that while looking up at the beach on the 23rd floor, tasting food is really a bonus. Parenting is one of the highlights of the hotel. Whether it is outdoor facilities, activities, swimming pools, and room layouts, children love them, and they will take the initiative to give gifts to the children when they check in. Thank you to all the staff for taking care of your baby and family during your stay. We will choose to come again!

I go to other places no less than two or three times a year, and I choose the best hotel in each place. This encounter is really unprecedented. For details, see: The attitude of the hotel front desk was a mess. The front desk turned his head up and rolled his eyes throughout the communication with me. Looking at me, it didn’t look like I had received professional training. In exchange for the reception of a hotel manager, the same look, maybe the company was trained in this way, or I didn’t have the temperament that they were willing to receive well. This matter came to an end. Get the room card to enter the room, drive too tired thinking about taking a bath and lie on the bed for a while, uncover the quilt, as shown in the picture below, inside the quilt cover, pillowcase, under the bed sheet, and under the bed are all hair, immediately the customer service call, come up and change I took the sheets and quilts, without apology, as usual I would give you a fruit, but I refused. After I changed the quilt, I still had more or less hair. I was speechless. I called the Consumer Association Health Commission Hotel. Calling from the headquarters, there was a lady who claimed to be the manager on duty. She said she wanted to transfer me to a hotel suite, but I refused. After that, she stopped contacting me. Only Ctrip customer service kept contacting me to find a way for me to rest. , I communicated with me and asked the hotel to change to a new set of bedding. I was too tired and wanted to rest, so I compromised. When I went to the room, I found that the new bedding had hair on the pillow. I cleaned it myself, slept all night, and canceled it. All the trips in Qinhuangdao returned home overnight. : The hotel receptionist was in a mess. The whole process of communicating with me looked at me with his head up and his eyes rolled. It was not like having received professional training. In exchange for a hotel manager who received the same reception and the same look, perhaps the company was trained in this way, and Or I didn’t have the temperament that they wanted them to receive.

Then there was a lady who claimed to be the manager on duty. She said she wanted to help me transfer to a hotel suite, but I refused, and then I stopped contacting me. With me, only Ctrip customer service has been contacting me to figure out a way for me to rest, and communicated with me to change the hotel to a new set of bedding.

msg:The breakfast is richer, that is, you need to line up in the middle of the holiday breakfast time. It is recommended to be early or later; maybe because of the summer vacation, there are more activities for children, and there are summer camps (though we did not participate); go out from the first floor and go through the garden. You can get to the beach in less than 5 minutes; then I have to praise Ji Congcong, the lobby manager of the hotel these days, and the waiter who does my cleaning service every day (don’t know what it’s called), kind attitude and good service! ! Then the restaurant service area was slightly inferior in the first few days, but it got better and better later. I don’t know if there are too many people causing confusion!
The overall feeling! According to the hotel level and price, the hotel is undoubtedly very good, but because Qinhuangdao is particularly seasonal, many service personnel are temporary internships during peak seasons. As a result, the training is not accurate enough, resulting in many children not having a sense of service. This needs to be improved. !
Then the quality of individual customers is too low, and they don’t know where their superiority comes from. They jump in line and hope that the hotel can improve itself and attract higher-quality customer groups!
Finally, I hope to come again later, it can be better!

The buffet really needs to be improved, and the dishes are more general. The same goes for Chinese restaurants. It really doesn't match the brand hotel.
The hardware facilities and reception services at the front desk are really professional. I like them. The buffet restaurant service is also very professional, and the taste of the dishes is too ordinary. Dinner seafood, meat dishes are too few, almost none. Breakfast noodles and desserts are the strengths of the brand hotel, as always, but there are few meat dishes.
Eat, live, play, go, eat first. If you don’t eat well, you can’t talk about vacation, and the dishes are deducted!

This time the hotel upgraded the room type for me, which made my big day more meaningful and really experienced big. Bigger rooms, higher floors, better views. Standing on the balcony listening to the sea breeze and the waves hitting the sand, my body and mood were relaxed. The gift packages prepared by the hotel for children are very rich, and the children are very happy. The manager of the breakfast restaurant, Xiao Cao, has a particularly attentive and humane service. She makes the children feel "special trea**ent". I hope the hotel will also praise Manager Xiao Cao, thank you. The overall experience of staying in is very unforgettable, because I often go to Qinhuangdao to see the sea in Beijing, and I will come to Shangri-La next time.

The gym is nice, spacious and bright, and complete disinfection supplies, that is, you must register every time you go in. Children cannot go in, this can be flexibly improved. You can set up a book corner where parents can see to solve the worries of fitness parents.
The sanitation of the room is not very good, and the table and countertops are only one hand away. Before I went out, I took a look at the hygiene in the house. After I returned, except for the towels, the scum on the floor and the hair in the bathroom were still in place.
The hotel should be the best on Golden Dream Bay, with gardens, and the closest and most convenient distance to the sea. However, the seawater in front of the door is rather mixed, and there are many sea****s and jellyfishes going east to west, and the seawater is obviously clean until the Qinhuang International Hotel. There is too much rubbish on the sea under the trestle bridge, and I sigh that the destruction of people is too strong.

The Chinese restaurant is quite satisfactory, and the vouchers for meals are quite suitable.

Movies can be watched on the lawn, as well as go-karts, and various amusement facilities are abundant.

After the lawn is the beach, the sand on the beach is fine and there are few broken shells, suitable for bare feet, but there are a lot of sea****s in the sea and it doesn't look so clean.

Pushing open the balcony door, a cool sea breeze came onwards. It was very cool. I lived on the 18th floor. The sea view effect was very good. It was facing the sea. Moreover, there is the sea downstairs, and it is good to be able to walk along the seashore. The hotel’s breakfast buffet is also great, and the hotel’s swing is also fun. Although I only stayed for one night, I will have the opportunity to stay again in the future. The experience is very good and highly recommended.

For example, we have a day In the next room at night, it is very late and the sound of the mobile phone can be clearly heard, which affects our sleep and is relatively collapsed. Therefore, we must understand clearly in advance when choosing a room type. The small mailbox at the entrance of the parent-child room on the 4.9th floor should be fully utilized. I always write to the baby with the baby’s favorite cartoon character. The first thing the baby wakes up is to see if there is any "Lightning McQueen" to write to her. , If one day she would be particularly happy, and every time she saw the waiter and aunt, she would show them. If this thing is done by the hotel, I want to experience and feel completely different. Thanks to all the staff for taking care of the baby and family during the stay, we will choose to come again!

Let me talk about the great things first:
1. The sea view is great, and the garden view downstairs is also good, comparable to clubmed of Anaya, but the community environment and the sandy quality of the beach are a bit worse than that of Anaya. After all, the feelings of Anaya are there and it is difficult to surpass .
2. The service is very good and the staff are very kind. Thank you Mr. Chao Wang who helped us with the check-in. He helped us upgrade the sea view room with balcony. Because we brought the children, we also helped to convert to a double bed room. The staff who cleaned the room were very kind. , Very friendly to children, delivered fruits and snacks, very caring, clubmed does not have these humanistic care from the hotel.
3. The parent-child park on the 23rd floor must bring the baby to check in. The sea view is very good, and the children also like to play.
4. The nearby Qinhuang Alley is worth visiting, and there are many snacks.
5. Children like the suitcases and toys in the package.
Let me talk about the following three areas that need improvement:
1. The water temperature in the children's pool is a bit cold, and the child keeps talking cold after soaking for a long time, and coughs and catches a cold at night. I hope that the water temperature in the children's pool will be higher.
2. The hotel's water is recommended to be changed. The bottle cap is not easy to open, and it does not match the overall feel of the hotel.
3. The breakfast is a bit richer, and there is still a gap with the clubmed breakfast, I hope it can be improved.
Overall I am very satisfied with a happy trip, I will choose here next time.

msg:It can be said that this Shangri-La is the best luxury hotel with sea view in downtown Qinhuangdao... If you compare it with the club med in Anaya, although the latter wins in the cultural environment and entertainment facilities, it is limited to the height of the floor, and the sea view is still not as good. Shangri-La. Shangri-La Hotel can live on up to 22 floors

Outside the hotel is a public beach. There are walking and bicycle paths along the beach, suitable for early morning and evening walks.

Room facilities: relatively complete facilities, normal five-star standard, no surprises. I ordered the Horizon Club, so the minibar drinks are free; the toiletries are L’Occitane, although this is the first time I have heard of it; the room will give 4 bottles of mineral water, but it turned out to be ice dew, which is a bit low, so let’s give it to a farmer.

Breakfast: Breakfast is served at Qin Café, the variety is not very rich, not very amazing, but it actually serves ice cream

wifi: very good signal

Bed: very comfortable, sleep till dawn

Restaurant: There are two Chinese and Japanese restaurants, both of which can be found in the reviews

Hygiene: very satisfied with hygiene

Parking: You can park your car, no problem traveling by car

Room view: When checking in, I specifically told the front desk to have a room facing the sea view. The floor is also relatively high, so the view is particularly good. The sound of ocean waves is particularly hypnotic

Location and transportation: Located in the downtown area of Qinhuangdao, not far from the pigeon nest and other attractions; it is within 30 minutes' drive from Qinhuangdao Railway Station and Beidaihe Railway Station

Service: When I go there is not a holiday or peak season, so there are fewer guests, the service is good, and late check-out is also allowed

Swimming pool: see indoor swimming pool

Gym: relatively complete equipment

Cost performance: As long as it is not peak season, the price is not very expensive. This hotel mainly wins with the sea view, it is the sea view, I will come again next time

TIPS: Some room types can have afternoon tea in the executive lounge for free, and a simple dinner will be served from 5:30 to 7:30 in the afternoon.

msg:This should be the most comfortable parent-child hotel in Qinhuangdao. If you don’t want to go out, parent-child activities will be arranged every day in the hotel. Opposite the hotel is the beach, which is very convenient. We brought a parasol, a chair, and plenty of water. We put on a one-piece swimsuit and a sun hat for the child, and then we can play in the sea. There is a swimming pool on the first floor of the hotel. We cleaned the sand on our body in the shower room inside. It was really difficult to clean it if we didn't bring it back to the hotel. I booked a beach-themed room, which is super big and has two rooms so the price is understandable. There are children's toys in the room, children's wash, and bath toys. If there are children's bathrobes and children's slippers, it would be better. .
Breakfast from 7.00 to -10.30. During peak season, there will be a line at 9 o'clock (Qin Coffee on the first floor). So if I go for breakfast early or at 10 o'clock, the food is not complete when I go to 10 o'clock, which is very disappointing.
In the evening, my husband and I had a barbecue in the hotel. The kids were playing football with the kids opposite, swinging on the swings and watching outdoor movies. It was very suitable for two people to live at this time.
The staff, whether it's the front desk or cleaning up the room, the restaurant staff are very good.

It is said that the Golden Dream Beach in front of the building was built with a inves**ent of more than one billion yuan. The scenery is beautiful and tree-lined. Parking is free. The front desk staff are polite and enthusiastic. The breakfast is rich in variety and delicious. Youtiao soy milk Hundreds of varieties such as noodles and buns. The set meal purchased also has coupons for hotels and lobby bars. With coupons to eat the evening buffet, you can realize the freedom of crayfish 🦞. The Chinese restaurant has boiled fish and drinks at the lobby bar in the evening. 🍺Listening to songs is very leisurely and comfortable, very satisfied, and will choose to stay 😀

msg:I booked an executive room with two breakfasts, but when I checked out, I found that I was still charged a few hundred yuan for breakfast. Although the hotel admitted that it was wrong, the money would not be refunded until a week later. I don't know why the hotel is so overbearing, bad reviews! The rooms and hygiene are pretty good. The Chinese restaurant is of excellent quality. Manager Mu Xuerui was meticulous and patient, and praised him.

酒店樓下有萌寵樂園，可以去喂，出來就是海灘，地理位置很好。離店時贈送小朋友禮物（很可愛的小粉龍），小寶也很喜歡。
美中不足的是自助早餐，140人一位，東西很少，味道一般，有待改善～

同行有長者和孩子，所以沒有選擇外賣和攤食，直接在酒店解決一日三餐省去了很多時間，中餐廳的味道不錯，菜品豐富，還有烤鴨，孩子很喜歡看師傅的烤鴨技藝。
我們的火車是下午5點，非常感謝前台的王娜，張佳經理幫長者延住到下午3點退房，省去了12點退房無法午休的麻煩。
給香格里拉的品質點贊，下次來秦皇島還會入住香格里拉。

msg:綜合不錯的一家酒店，有自己的花園，通往沙灘很方便（進出需要刷房卡）。周邊離野生動物園和海底世界都不遠，海底世界可以步行前往。周邊距離大型商業茂業天地也很近，購物用餐都很方便。
酒店服務方面打掃房間的姐姐，餐廳領位的姐姐都挺好。設施有點老式，如其他評價，水依然是冰露。海景房景觀很好，過節不少晚上放花的，早上還可以在屋裡看個日出。
早餐人多需要排隊等位，好在秩序井然。
花園有小童的電動車和雙人自行車，租金有點貴，性價比一般。
酒店地面、地下都有停車場。地下停車場的電梯不能直達房間樓層，需要換乘。和前台報備車號可以免費停車。

1.房間沒有擦手方巾，抽紙和拖鞋，説明房間清掃不規範
2.除了前台，其他服務人員沒有主動向客人問好的，即使在電梯裏也如是，體驗很不好
3.西餐廳用早餐，一個貌似領班的男士站在門口讓我出示門卡，用手裡的刷卡器一刷，跟我説你這個衹帶一個早餐，我説帶雙早啊，他馬上就改口讓我到結賬櫃枱確認，結果是雙早，他始終沒有一句道歉，既然自己手裡的機器不準確就不要搶着刷了，萬一碰上個暈頭客人，是不是又讓人家再買一份早餐？
3. 對早餐菜品非常不滿意，果汁是摻水的！西餐腸味道怪怪的，整個菜品水平連內地三星酒店都不如。白瞎了香格里拉的品牌。
4.一層健身中心門口的小童活動區域，三個小夥子都在低頭玩手機，感覺特別蕭條。
5. 前台工作人員劉亞惠和王娜比較熱情，提出表揚。
疫情之前經常住秦皇島香格里拉，有了這次體驗以後再也不會住了。

缺點是：設施有點舊了，我住的1601房間，陽台很大對着大海，問題是床頭掉皮，電視也太老了。
整體上來説還是很不錯的，帶孩子來住很合適。

服務：送物非常及時。工作人員禮貌且熱情。

自助餐，太一般了，性價比太低。因為前兩天住在假期酒店，住店客人128減20，才108，而且菜品質量非常好，甜品也很精緻。我對酒店自助的要求就是甜品，你們酒店的太像外面買回來的現成的小糕點了，毫無食慾。

從踏入酒店的那一刻起，就感受到了它的用心與細緻。房間整潔舒適，各類設施齊全，讓人倍感温馨。
 
特別要稱讚的是前台的王娜和周洋兩位同事，她們的服務令人印象尤為深刻。王娜始終以微笑迎接我們，提供了詳盡的入住指南以及諸多實用建議。無論我們有何需求，她都能迅速、熱情地迴應並予以協助。
 
周洋則在餐飲推薦和安排方面表現出色。她對酒店的餐飲產品極為熟悉，總能依據我們的口味喜好給出恰當的建議。
 
她們二人的專業與熱情，讓我們在酒店的入住期間感受到了家一般的温暖。她們的服務態度切實體現了酒店的服務理念，也為我們的旅程增添了一抹温馨與舒適。
 
總之，此次入住體驗甚佳，我會毫不猶豫地向親朋好友推薦這家酒店，同時也期望王娜和周洋能一直保持這般卓越的服務水準。

1，晚上10點多開車到達酒店大堂門口，燈光很暗，下車看了一下，想找到負責停車的指揮人員，衹看到一個穿着黑色棉服的大爺在溜達，見到我也不打招呼，以為衹是路人，正好通道上已經停了幾輛車，也就找空停下，提上行李辦入住了。結果第二天早上往車上放行李，就有另一個也是穿着黑色棉服的大爺上來就沖我吼，你是幹嘛的，誰讓你把車停在這裏的？我解釋説夜裡來的，沒人告訴我停到哪裡。他就又吼道，這是臨時停車位，你趕緊把車開走，住店的也不能停。我真是無語了，五星酒店，著名連鎖，竟然有這樣的管理。
2，房間老舊，陽台門關不嚴，風大的時候會有吹哨子一樣的噪音，搞得一晚上沒睡好!
3，餐廳服務人員，特別是做麪食的師傅，態度傲慢，感覺你是在煩他，要一份麪，要承受他好幾次白眼。
反正這次的感受極差，以後可能不會考慮這家酒店!

第一天：上午10點左右提前聯繫了酒店客服詢問是否可以直接入住，接着管家聰聰第一時間聯繫我，並安排好了房間並有驚喜禮物（孩子很喜歡看第一個照片）提前錄入了車牌號。
給安排了去海灘的孩子喜歡的小工具（不用買或租了，省心！）
送了果盤和所需用品！
因住的是城堡🏰 對面還可以用對面的套房裡面有洗衣機，洗衣服很方便！
第三天：辦理離店手續期間管家聰聰一直幫忙處理，還送了孩子一個小禮物 娃很開心🥳
兩天下來整體遊玩感覺很好，酒店裡麪23層風景很好，歡迎大家都去看看！酒店裡麪的自助餐很好吃，小龍蝦、烤肉、蛋糕很不錯！
最後：謝謝管家聰聰，很開心的一趟旅行！
在外旅行，開心順利很重要！

訂的22層海景陽台房，本以為服務不錯。孩子晚上吃壞了肚子，弄臟了床單，第二天告知，需要賠償600元！前台小哥還各種PUA，説本來得賠1000多，現在再打個折，僅需要300。我就呵呵了。合著五星級酒店的床單都是金子做的，比家裡高檔床單都貴 還洗不凈。
此外，酒店很舊了，餐廳的餐與五星級酒店差距還很大。非常不推薦。

這是我們第二次入住了，同樣也是下次的不二之選。再次感謝香格里拉酒店提供的周到的服務。

相比其他酒店，整體管理更規範，性價比也不錯。前台接待和禮賓部，樓層服務員，都很周到細緻，工作認真負責，很專業！房間桌角都有防磕碰貼，非常貼心。
酒店硬件和軟件都很好，中規中矩，出後門穿過花園就是海灘，沙子細膩，海水乾淨，人不是很多，帶孩子玩非常舒適。酒店還有小動物可以餵食。
酒店早餐時間長，品種齊全。但感覺餐廳和餐食不符合香格里拉酒店品牌，四星級別。還有房間瓶裝水，冰露，應該換。個人感覺。
總之，酒店整體服務還是很好的，值得信賴和入住。

香格里拉確實是老牌子的好酒店，大堂寬敞明亮，大堂吧舒適可人，進門就有熟悉的淡淡香味（這家香味略有點過），屋裡也很乾凈，所有床品衞生用品都很充足。住起來很舒服。環境也是最好，靠近城區，周邊餐廳林立，配套齊全。特別是緊靠海岸，沙灘，這裏的海邊即有美麗的海景，也有城市夜間的繁華，非常適合年輕人的夜，也給商務人士以方便和滿足。
  也有幾個小的不足，例如房間內牆插比較少而且有的沒電；外牆皮大面積脱落卻沒有修復，房間裏洗臉池水龍頭太小，淋浴器沒有雙頭甚至比一般家庭的洗澡間設施還差一點。不過這些都可以優化。總的説來，香格里拉大酒店在這裏還是最好的酒店。

衞生：從酒店大堂到房間，衞生真的很乾凈，沒有異味。

環境：周邊環境不錯，出了酒店大堂離海邊很近。不願意進海溜達的，酒店內泳池也很不錯。

服務：酒店的服務很不錯，入住酒店其實首先面對的是服務，感覺酒店的兩位員工真的不錯，一個是王娜、一個是李金鈺。

生意感受很不錯，下次還會繼續。

酒店提供了圍欄和餐椅，不過沒有温奶器和冷藏的冰箱，感覺冰箱有20度左右，打電話問前台説冰箱衹能保鮮，儲存奶和輔食的温度肯定達不到，供帶小月齡寶寶的家庭參考。整體冬天淡季來性價比很高。

入住，還算順利，高峯，排隊五分鐘。（為啥入住讓我們等房20分鐘，離店卻要必須12點前呢？霸王條款？）
房間非常nice，海景，陽台，無敵的視野，心曠神怡。也很乾凈。但可能是我錢沒給足，迷你吧空空如也。衣帽櫃裏沒有傘，需要的話去前台掃碼…
晚飯圖省事，去了二樓餐廳，貴也就罷了，服務極差，一個男生，把一份小吃拼盤扔桌上就走，喊都喊不回來，關鍵是上錯了，我沒點啊。菜不難吃當重點吧。
早餐在一樓，自助中規中矩，沒有特色，或許秦皇島沒特色？
樓下花園非常棒，我遇到的最棒的，鴿子，羊駝，大白鵝…我閨女非常開心。室內泳池除了水涼點，還可以，很乾凈，如果沒有上課的小盆友就更棒了。
除了門就是海灘，回來可以沖腳，有管家看門，安全係數還可以。
説個特別暖的，客房小夥李志強？知道我住一天，還是來主動打掃房間，看我帶了孩子主動拿來小童沐浴套裝，主動意識非常強。很貼心那種。
總結：在夏季高峯期的最後一天，酒店體現出了能省則省…海灘廣播，九月一日海灘就關閉了，想去的，大家抓緊啊。（公共海灘，應該可以去，但是沒有保潔和救生員了吧？我也不太懂）希望幫到大家

大學在秦，後又來秦多次，也算熟悉。第一天訂的阿爾卡迪亞，除了草坪好一點沙子細一點，其他一言難盡。第二天換香格里拉試試，登記小哥為了調房間，啞着嗓子一通聯繫，對比阿卡隨意插隊和前台小姐姐全程愛理不理，瞬間慶幸這次選擇好像對了。環境沒得説，面朝大海，心暖花開，酒店設施齊全；附近秦皇小巷美食街和各種餐館，更適合居住。
重點説服務吧，必須要説管家alice小姐姐簡直是仙女一般的存在，細緻貼心，無微不至，有什麼問題都給及時解決，還時不時給孩子準備個小驚喜，大大的贊👍。因為是套房，可以免費用一些簡餐，有感於23樓的王娜，金鈺服務的耐心周到，從容應對各種熊孩子的要求，好辛苦。
住了兩天捨不得走，又續一天，希望酒店找準定位，保障服務，再接再厲，以後來秦除了燕大就住這了吧。
關於餐廳：日料餐廳屬於外包，建議吃飯的的朋友，不要點太貴的單品，也記得核對下水單，我在這出了點小問題；中餐廳服務菜品參考北京香宮，上菜速度有點慢，蒸個螃蟹要近一小時；早餐廳烙煎餅的阿姨略帶口音的秦普和吊吊的樣子，時刻提醒你這裏首先是一個北方四線濱海小城，然後才是國際豪華五星酒店。

酒店離海是真的近，下樓出門就是海，而且通往海邊的門口衹有刷房卡才能出入，充分考慮了住客的私隱和安全問題。
酒店配套的餐廳秦咖啡，早餐和自助午晚餐的菜品質量不錯，食材新鮮，不過種類選擇略少，屬於還算夠吃的那種。
整體來説是一個不錯的體驗，下次去還會再次選擇。

整體來説，不錯，以後還會再來

環境：環境絕佳，樓下就有小童遊樂區，泳池也適合孩子玩耍，晚上還可以在樓下玩兒一些娛樂設施（自費）。距離沙灘非常近，出了門口就是海邊，非常適合小朋友挖沙子。
服務：從入住到退房服務都是無可挑剔，態度非常好，小朋友給免費加床，準備了小童用品。
餐飲：樓下自助餐廳還可以，價格很便宜，就是種類比較少。
來秦皇島帶小朋友玩兒還是比較推薦香格里拉的，吃，玩兒都非常方便。

msg:酒店的服務符合香格里拉的標準，無論是總枱、客房還是大堂、餐廳，服務人員都稱得上五星加的水平。給實施打3分，主要有幾點需要改進，第一，房間的牙刷邊刷邊掉毛，顯然牙刷的質量太差了，再差的酒店都不會遇到這種情況，真的需要改進。第二是酒店盥洗室的用品配置稍簡單了一些，我理解酒店的ESG（國際標準）的治理要求，減少垃圾特別是對環境有危害的垃圾數量，但不能以客人的不方便為代價。一些基本的配置還是要的。或者在前台辦理入住時給客人講明，客人認為需要的，及時通知客房服務人員按客人的需要配置。這樣會比較完美。總體來説，這家酒店是北戴河度假理想的住宿地，服務態度優質，早餐豐富，餐飲味道比較可可，去沙灘方便，周邊的服務實施比較齊全。

衞生：衞生好，五星級酒店的專業水準
設施：設施有點老了，畢竟也是裝修好多年了，但是都挺乾淨，沒有壞的
服務：服務有失香格里拉的水準，第一天晚上酒店用晚餐，被告知有活動，衹能坐大門口，這倒無所謂，但是餐廳的服務人員你説話就不會好好説嗎？一副愛吃不吃的樣子，我又不欠你的。

十一假期期間出行，酒店提前一天打電話問入住的特殊要求，在一定程度上節省了客人登記入住時間，點贊👍
