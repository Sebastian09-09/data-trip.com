This alone is a hundred times better than a certain camp!

Facilities: The room is equipped with a whole-house oxygen generator, floor heating, a small sun, and a humidifier. The toilet has a bathroom heater and the hot water is hot enough.

Hygiene: The whole yard is clean and tidy, and you can see the staff's usual care. The house is also clean. The countertops and floors are very clean.

Environment: The scenery from the room is amazing! Worth the price!

Service: The staff are very enthusiastic. When we arrived that day, three people were waiting by the car to help with the luggage! The lineup was full hahahaha. After entering the room, the facilities in the room will be introduced in turn. The scenery outside the window. Every time there is a message, it is also replied in seconds~ I love puppies too~ Thank you~

Meals: It is no exaggeration to say that it is the most delicious and suitable meal since entering Xinjiang. The boiled meat and stir-fried lamb with green onions are super delicious😋~ When my husband went for breakfast, there were no eggs, and the kitchen sister specially cooked two more for us to take. During the chat, I found out that the chef is from Northeast China. No wonder he is so warm and the food is so delicious.

Finally: This kind of hotel with beautiful scenery and pet-friendly environment should be cherished. Wear diapers in the room as much as possible and do not damage the facilities.

The breakfast in the morning was also very rich. It was not easy for the restaurant to have such a rich breakfast in such a sp****ly populated place!
The next day, the store manager helped to find villagers to buy gas for our car, and also introduced us to the nearby travel guide. We don't need to make a guide here! The service attitude of this homestay is really in place~

When you wake up in the morning, you can see the continuous snow-capped mountains opposite from the bed, but it is a pity that you can't see the golden mountain in the sun this time. The service is very good, the staff is responsive, and they also helped us upgrade the room floor with a better view~
What conquered me the most is the restaurant, the hot pot and the dishes are amazing! The four of us ordered a yak beef set meal + two hot dishes, and drank red wine together in the evening. It was wonderful~ The eggplant box made by the kitchen is super delicious. It is a hidden dish that we saw the staff eating and ordered extra. If you are interested, you can also order it when you stay. Hahaha

Because we didn't order meals in advance, dinner was cooked in the kitchen. We were notified to eat after only a short rest. The delivery was very fast. Because it was off-season, the boss also helped us upgrade the snow view room. When we opened the curtains, we could see Ka Lake and Kongur Peak. The scenery was amazing. The room was clean and comfortable, with floor heating. I was very satisfied with the bed and pillows, and the hot water was also very good.

In the evening, I went to the hotel lobby to breathe oxygen for a while. The elder brother at the front desk made hot tea, and the elder sister cut fruit and sent it to the room. The hotel is very close to Lake Karakul. It is perfect to walk there in the morning and enjoy the uninhabited scenic spot. The hotel is very good. I will come again next time👋

It suddenly snowed on the day of check-in, and the grayness still couldn't block the beauty outside the window. The room facilities are good, the bedding is very comfortable, and the bathroom space is large, but there is a lack of racks to hang towels and clothes. The boss should consider arranging it. In addition, the heating effect of the bathroom heater is a little thin. You can prepare a small waterproof heater. After all, our bathroom is big. The dinner in the homestay is the most delicious meal in the five-day trip to Ta County. Then there is the software. The service is definitely better than some five-star hotels. If there is any problem, they will respond in time to help solve it as soon as possible. It is a warm homestay. I was really reluctant to leave. I recommend staying here for a few days.

The scenery of the snow-capped mountains is especially special in the morning, and if you get up early, you can see the golden mountain in the sun. Regarding dining, probably because the food is limited in this location, there are not many types of breakfast (I want to eat meat ∠( ᐛ 」∠)＿), and dinner is ordered by yourself, but the taste is really good, especially homely. The service of the staff is also very good, and it is still recommended if you drive by yourself.

He introduced the room facilities to us very carefully, and answered questions and gave good suggestions.
The mattress was very comfortable, and it was the most comfortable night I slept on this trip.
In the morning, you can see the changes in the sky before sunrise in the room by opening the curtains. You can go downstairs to watch the sunrise, and there is a terrace to go up.
The breakfast is simple and delicious, and the ingredients taste very good. I like it very much.

Advantages: The transportation is convenient, just next to 314. The overall quality is a high-end B&B, very stylish, and the boss is naturally ambitious; Disadvantages: 1. The room is too cold and the radiator is not enough. This is a basic problem and it does not solve the other problems. It's all nonsense; 2. Due to the hardware, the room is not wide enough, slightly cramped, and the comfort is not good; 3. Due to various conditions, the catering is average, the breakfast is too late, and most guests cannot stay in the hotel Enjoy it slowly, and more of it is to continue traveling; 4. Based on the above, the conclusion is: expensive, not worth it, and not cost-effective.

The closed environment has not yet received air, so we did not dare to do it all night. To sleep well, it is recommended that each room has at least a small vent; 2. The air oxygen concentration cannot be controlled: one person sleeps, two people sleep, the toilet window is open or fully closed, the oxygen generator is turned up and down, and the oxygen concentration in the environment is measured Various changes, the human body's normal oxygen uptake concentration range is 19.5% to 23.5%, the existing oxygen concentrator does not have the function of automatically adjusting according to the environment, it is recommended to improve the oxygen concentrator with automatic adjus**ent function. 3. A closed room➕oxygen generator➕heater can be imagined to be very dry. It is recommended to add a humidifier. The boss will know as soon as he sleeps.

msg:塔縣唯一的五鑽級別酒店，確實尤其過人之處，首先位置無敵，且足夠野，就在喀什到塔縣的必經之路邊，很適合喀什出發，在木吉邊防公路玩一天後，在這裏留宿，第二天還能繼續就近玩喀拉庫勒湖和慕士塔格冰川公園，這兩個景點也都不遠。
.
然後就是景觀無敵，在酒店房間裏甚至就能看到喀拉庫勒湖和其背後的公格爾九別峯，而冰川之父慕士塔格就在視野的右側，湖光山色盡收眼底，美不勝收。
.
如果衹是位置和景觀優秀，估計這家小體量酒店也難當攜程5鑽級別，酒店的客房面積和配置也足夠出色，在這個位置實屬一等一的了。
.
房間足夠寬敞，配有彌散式製氧機，全屋地暖非常給力，升温迅速，秋冬來此應該是不懼嚴寒的。
.迷你吧用的茶裏茶包，配的玻璃瓶裝冰川水，需要滾沸後引用，此外有速溶咖啡和掛耳，歡迎禮有各種堅果等。
.
酒店客房最高三層，自然是越高景觀越好，不過4樓也有露台，5層還有個瞭望台，老闆還可以帶去後山上居高望遠，觀景是沒啥問題，不過有無人機的話就更方便了。
.
衞生間熱水充足，洗澡不成問題，也有智能馬桶蓋，配置舒適度還是相當高的。
.
缺點有兩個，一是早餐太過簡單，二是房間裏沒裝空調，導致白天玻璃房受熱嚴重，屋內無法降温，這要是夏天估計遭不住。

msg:極度推薦這家酒店，在帕米爾高原停留過夜的最優選。首先，房間裏有瀰漫式供氧，在3650米海拔的地方過夜，如果想一夜好眠，這太重要了。

第二，酒店有醫用製氧機！【劃重點】我們娃，一到白沙湖這個位置就開始出現高反症狀，胃裡噁心不吐，但是沒精神打蔫。靠房間裏瀰漫式供氧也緩不過來。酒店竟然有醫用製氧機，吸氧半小時，孩子就緩過來了，立刻活潑了能吃飯了。每天早中晚各吸氧一次，一次半小時到一小時。沒有立刻返回喀什，能住一夜，把帕米爾高原精髓都看到，孩子也沒受罪沒危險，全靠了酒店的製氧設備。

第三，服務非常好，從酒店的白店長、前台兩位小姐姐、幫忙搬運行李的小哥、餐廳的大姐。每一個人都熱情、主動幫忙，積極幫助提供解決方案。比如主動問孩子高反好點嗎，酒店剛剛到了新設備製氧機，吸氧效果比房間的好。比如餐廳主動給孩子煮雞蛋羹，雖然娃挑食不吃，但很感動。孩子在大廳吸氧的時候，前台所有酒店員工都幫忙照料。

第四，餐廳的伙食很好。強烈推薦氂牛肉火鍋，氂牛肉看起來全瘦，竟然涮火鍋非常嫩。兩個大人吃兩盤，正好吃飽，徹底解饞可能需要再加一盤。早餐比預期的好很多，本來以為高原地區條件很艱苦，沒想到吃飽吃好，全沒問題。

遇見了藍天白雲下的雪山濕地，遇見了慕士塔格峯和公格爾峯。
遇見了熱情、熱心、耐心的老闆和店裡的帥哥美女，家人有高反，送了氧氣和紅景天，室內的彌散式供氧幫助安心睡眠。
遇見了璀璨的星空，肉眼可見的銀河。
“遇見”的廚師必須贊一個，吃到迄今為止最可口的氂牛火鍋。旁桌點的番茄炒蛋吃得乾乾淨淨，據評很好吃。
希望下次再來“遇見”，雪山下面來一盤番茄炒蛋就紅酒。

msg:打卡入住過的閨蜜強烈推薦的營地，遇見慕士塔格
風景一流，沒有異議，美景戰勝了房價！

睡在床上看日照金山的感覺不錯
酒店送的紅酒很不錯
大堂多個拍照打卡點，適合我愛拍照的媽媽

【住宿條件】
房間有供養設備和暖氣片，保一晚好覺
衞浴設施在高原的酒店來看，算還可以的，淋浴水熱。建議高反的不要洗澡！一定不可以着涼！

【用餐】強推餐廳大廚！高水準！提前預訂
我點了：葱爆羊肉、炒氂牛肉（和塔縣相比，一點不柴）、手撕包菜、番茄蛋湯。四人份量。

早餐小米粥不錯，幾個小菜簡單但味美

餐廳在後排，如果在四層，做成景觀餐廳看着雪山用餐就就更棒了

msg:這家民宿最大的特色應該是可以在房間裏就可以看到慕士塔格峯。天氣晴朗的時候應該可以看到日出和日落時的日照金山，可惜這次多雲未能看到。夜裡天氣好的時候 還會組織去山上看星星。

房間的製氧設備很高級，讓全屋氧氣提升，也可以接上鼻導管單獨吸氧。房間的電暖器也很給力，十一期間外面已飄雪，房間內還是暖和。

民宿的老闆和工作人員都很熱情，從行前就開始聯絡客人提供指引，中間還會介紹一些小眾景觀定位。記得多問問，説不定有一些越野行程可以蹭上。
這次初上高原，凌晨發現血氧飽和度低，老闆非常負責地拿來鼻導管來幫忙，把客人照顧好了後才放心離去，還送了紅景天和氧氣罐，非常貼心

如果你去塔縣是3天行程，第一天在這裏落腳會是不錯的選擇

msg:帕米爾之行最佳體驗-遇見慕士塔格民宿

一切始於景觀，終於服務品質，哪怕衹有短短一晚也被深深折服。
景觀無須多言，正面直對公格爾九別峯，側面被慕士塔格峯環繞，面向喀湖，圓你坐在温暖舒適的客房裡看雪山疊嶂日照金山的夢。
何況這是堪比星級酒店的客房，起初我還擔憂集裝箱保温舒適性要打折扣，但是房間裏配了醫院級別的瀰漫製氧、暖氣、遮光窗簾，體感舒適温暖。而且房間夠大，落地景觀窗通透敞亮。送紅酒什麼的都不值一提，果乾茶包都很好吃，足見選品的細緻用心。特別表揚床墊，絕對是超五星的選品，很大程度上彌補了集裝箱本身在穩定性上的缺陷，大家可以親自體驗一下。
民宿的管家式服務實在是太體貼了。不是故意對比，但因為幾個月前度假剛剛長住過瑞吉酒店，這家民宿在有限的條件裏發現了無限的服務空間，並且做到極致，從單客體驗上來説絕對不輸瑞吉（畢竟瑞吉也沒能讓我主動給寫長評哈哈）。從預訂就主動加好微信，做好行前提醒，甚至還可以提供行程攻略，尤其是一些小眾景點指路。入住當天停車就有人來提行李，專人送到客房介紹設施、備品。有任何需要都可以隨時告知，衹有你想不到沒有酒店解決不了的。我帶父母自駕，我媽高反嚴重，一入住馬上有人送來鼻吸設備，在瀰漫製氧以外再加強氧氣供應。晚飯時老闆看我媽沒下樓吃飯，還特意拿保温杯裝了冰糖雪梨湯給我媽補充糖分，還備了小米粥和一些適口性好的餐品送到房間，看我媽毫無好轉，緊急又送了紅景天口服液過來，全程主動照顧，比我這個家屬還要上心體貼，讓我也有時間和精力可以好好休息。另外如果天氣條件允許，民宿還會組織比如夜觀銀河、探訪小眾景點等等活動，不用擔心地處偏僻缺乏娛樂活動，我甚至覺得這裏值得專門玩一天一夜。
意外的驚喜是民宿的餐飲絕對是我們一路上吃到的最落胃的一頓了，不光有火鍋、炒菜，還可以提前訂餐，最難得是有新鮮綠葉蔬菜，光想想卡車去喀什買一次菜的曲折、高原環境綠葉菜的保鮮時長就知道這些蔬菜來之不易，關鍵是價格也太良心了。
所以，預算和時間夠的話一定要來這裏為行程圓滿錦上添花。帕米爾兩天一夜太匆忙，深度遊建議三天兩夜其中至少安排一晚雪山曠野的住宿，那就一定一定不能錯過這裏！

大多數服務人員還可以，唯一不能理解的是，我在微信提前訂晚餐的時候，説我隨行的朋友（實際上我們包車的司機大哥）不是酒店住客，所以不能在餐廳一起吃飯。
那我？？民宿前不着村後不着店的，大老遠才趕到民宿的，讓人走？？

第五，服務很好，全程微笑服務，耐心用心，有求必應，還特別給小朋友送了冰糖雪梨。
總之，來了一定會給整個南疆旅程加分！

十一期間房間太緊俏，定了最後一間景觀房，老闆娘很負責任的聯繫我們説可能景色沒有別的房間那麼好，來跟我們再三確定要不要退，但是實際上早上醒來還是美哭啊😭

2. 餐廳炒菜味道很好，好奇3600米的海拔怎麼如此鍋氣十足。
3. 早起拉開窗簾……就覺得一切都值了。
4. 老闆娘有私藏景點和路線，非常意外的驚喜。
5. 彌散式氧氣很方便，軟裝和服務看得出很用心，公區晚上有壁爐，旅友可以聊天打屁。考慮到一路的條件（例如某書對沿途廁所的吐槽），硬裝已經非常超預期了。
6. 乾淨！設備都是新的，吹風機連插頭保護套都沒有摘。
推薦！

msg:超級滿意的一次旅行，其實從喀什到塔縣真的非常遠，選一箇中間住宿的地方真的很有必要，這次遇見系列開的民宿一下子就相中了，他們在伊犁開的遇見鄉野也住過，一如既往的好評。房間就可以看湖看峯～運氣好就能直接看日照金山了。晚餐的氂牛肉火鍋也好吃，特別適合疲憊的一天補充體力，半夜還可以跟着老闆爬後山看星空，就是晚上很冷一定要穿厚一點。熱水很足不過怕高反沒有洗頭哈哈哈～
