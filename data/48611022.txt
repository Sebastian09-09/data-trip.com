msg:My stay at Ascott Raffles City Chongqing was deeply disappointing and unsatisfactory.

I had booked a deluxe suite expecting a city view, as indicated in the listing. Instead, I was given a room facing an office block, with such close mutual visibility that privacy concerns were unavoidable. When I raised this issue, I was informed of a "misunderstanding" in the listing and was told that to receive the room I had initially expected, I would need to pay an additional 30%. This situation was particularly frustrating, given that the oversight was entirely on the hotel's part, with no fault of my own.

Moreover, I was mistakenly accused by the front reception of playing loud music one night, despite the fact that I wasn't playing any music. This unfounded complaint, combined with the lack of initiative to verify the claim before contacting me, highlighted a significant lapse in service quality.

Given this experience, I advise future travelers to consider establishments that better prioritize customer satisfaction. Based on my positive experiences, the Intercontinental at Raffles City Chongqing offers a more reliable alternative.

They patiently guide you to the right Train stations, hail car or cab is easily available at the LG level, help you order food delivery etc. The shopping mall is right at the Hotel with all the international and local brands and many restaurants and shops within walking distance. Amazing view as its located at the meeting of two rivers and the night cruise ride is just 5 minutes walk away. The breakfast had delicious noodles served every morning. There is an amazing children playroom with slides and ball pits. Overall, it was the best stay ever with the best location and the best staff service!  Highly recommend staying at Raffles Ascott.

The staff is very friendly and some of them spoke English. The room itself was amazing. It was basically a 1 bedroom apartment. It also had a combo washer/dryer which was SO helpful to me as I had been traveling for a while and needed to do laundry. This hotel is very comfortable. They have a 24 hr room service robot that you can order using WeChat. The in-room dining service had good food. I ordered dumplings and fried rice that were both great. One feedback I have is that it would be great if ordering room service was done digitally instead of calling. I tried to order a second time but had an embarrassing moment of language barrier so I didn‚Äôt order. I also had trouble using my Visa card to pay for the in room dining service.

It only takes a few minutes to walk to Hongyadong, and it is only 1 or 2 kilometers to Jiefangbei and Shibati. You can take a taxi or walk to get there. It's especially great!! But the best thing is the service. The security uncles on the LG and 1st floors are so enthusiastic. I stayed here for five days. The different security uncles were really more enthusiastic than each other. The cleaners on the floors were also very enthusiastic. It really gave people a feeling of being at home!! It's really great!! It's very suitable for guests with babies who need to make complementary foods. The kitchen equipment is available!! Five-star praise!! When we finally checked out, because the high-speed rail was at 5 pm, the hotel also let us check out a few hours later for free, which is very humane!! Great! ! ! ! I will stay here when I come to Chongqing in the future!!

I woke up from my dream. Then let‚Äôs talk about the room the hotel changed. I booked a one-room executive room with an unobstructed view. Because I couldn‚Äôt take out my clothes from the washing machine at that time, I asked the hotel to change the room to one on the same floor. After changing, I went out for sightseeing. When I returned to the room in the evening, I could only see half of the night view. I found the hotel staff who was changing rooms in the afternoon and said that the room was full. I asked the leader to see if there was any other way and call me back. But I also saw on the Ctrip website that there are executive rooms? No one called me to explain this until I left the store the next day.

msg:It was the first time I received a bad review when I stayed at a hotel. I checked out at 9:30 and called the day before at 3:30 in the afternoon to ask. I asked if the date on the small calendar in the bedroom was circled with a pen. I was confused. I was traveling with a four-year-old child, and I asked and replied that I didn‚Äôt know what the desk calendar was. Before the verification was completed, the hotel did not wait for a reply for a minute and directly deducted the money from the deposit. The speed is amazing. If you can't prove it yourself, let's not worry about it for now.
Let‚Äôs briefly talk about the experience of staying here.
1. The environment is quite decent, and the doorman is praised by name for his very friendly attitude.
2. There is something on the coffee table in the room. It is sticky and black, and it is disgusting. Since the coffee table is basically not used, I am too lazy to go to the front desk and just take a photo to record the situation.
3. Although the bathroom bathtub is made of marble, there are yellow spots of scale everywhere. If you need a disposable bathtub cover, you need to buy it separately. There are yellow stains and handwriting patterns on the bathroom curtains. I am afraid that the deposit will be withheld if the explanation is not clear when checking out. Photo records were taken upon check-in.
4. The hotel is marked as a parent-child hotel on Ctrip. Let me briefly introduce the actual situation of the parent-child park. The parent-child park is really shabby. The slides of a few square meters and two small pink tables are actually turned into black. The small ones on the table are The toy should have not been updated since the establishment of the hotel. It has become black and dull. What's more serious is that it is seriously damaged. The cracked plastic is sharp and sharp. When I took it out of the box, it directly scratched the palm of my hand. Fortunately, it was not a child. Take it, otherwise it will scratch the children and this parent-child paradise hotel will become a joke. Although I was scratched, I was not that squeamish and handed the dangerous item to the front desk staff and explained that it was damaged. It is easy to scratch children. I was scratched when I picked it up. The front desk accepted the product and replied: Oh, I understand. The attitude was perfunctory, the scratch wasn't serious, and I couldn't be bothered to take care of it. He left without delving into it further. With this kind of attitude and facilities, the service label of a family hotel can really be cancelled. To prevent other children from suffering.
To sum up, it is an average hotel with no outstanding points. The children's facilities are very poor.

This time I finally came to Chongqing again and decisively chose this place. The location is high and convenient, and the service staff are professional and proactive. Enthusiastic. I used the room upgrade coupon for my stay this time. I was directly upgraded from a two-bedroom suite to a three-bedroom suite. The area doubled. I was shocked when I walked in. It was so big that our family of three each had their own room and bathroom, even our luggage. There is also a single room with two large, two small and four beds. It can accommodate seven or eight people normally. The high area has a good view and has a panoramic view of the two rivers. When you go out of the apar**ent, turn right and you will find Raffles City shopping mall. It is extremely convenient for shopping. The nearby attractions are also about ten minutes away by car, and it feels very central. A bonus is that it also provides a luggage butler service. When checking out, you can send your luggage directly to the airport. It is really considerate for passengers with late flights. Now, I can continue shopping for a few more hours without dragging my bags. I won‚Äôt say much else. I will continue to stay here when I come to Chongqing.

Professional, enthusiastic, and kind. Jack and a tall young man obviously took the initiative to observe. The elderly and children took the initiative to help communicate when they encountered problems with hailing taxis. They were kind ‚ù§Ô∏è
Room service: four and a half stars
Polite, enthusiastic and responsive. The room was quite clean and cleaned in a timely manner! If the water is not enough, replenish it in time.
Hardware: Samsung and a half
The tableware, kitchen utensils, coffee machine, and bath and skin care products are all very satisfactory. The pillows are average in comfort. The network is really poor. When I walk near the bathroom, the signal disappears. At its strongest, it only has two bars. It's really unfriendly! Even the child check-in software cannot run, which is terrible. The curtains are not in a suitable position to be drawn, and the TV cabinet is blocking them. They should be replaced with automatic ones.
Restaurant: I don‚Äôt want to give it even one star
The dishes are relatively small, not up to the standard of a four-star hotel. The key is that the management is chaotic. If there are more people, it will become chaotic. The dishes are not replenished in a timely manner. The noodle stalls are out of order. The most annoying thing is the manager or someone who is too nervous at the door. On the verification card. She has no sense of service and is not polite. She didn't bring her card and told her the room number. She was reluctant to sign it and check it again. She also held you back until she checked it thoroughly before letting you in. You stayed for five or six days in a row until Thursday. It's Friday and we go through the process as seriously as the first time we met. All in all, it was neither professional nor friendly, and it felt completely out of touch. It was not a little different from the experience in other depar**ents.
The front desk is quite satisfactory, at least friendly communication and efficient handling.

The location is above Raffles City. There is a shopping mall downstairs. It is very convenient for shopping and entertainment. Opposite is the Grand Theater. A few hundred meters next to it is Hongya Cave, but there are too many people in Hongya Cave.
The beautiful woman at the front desk was very warm and considerate. She helped me upgrade the room. It was really too big. It felt empty even for four people. The hygiene and facilities were very good and the bed was comfortable. What I liked most was that the quilt was of the right thickness. Most hotels have the same thickness. The thick quilt is thick all year round, and it is very uncomfortable when it is hot or cold when it is not covered, so this place is very suitable.
There is also a robot that delivers food that children love, it‚Äôs really cute!

There is free late night snack before 23:00 every night. I returned to the hotel very late this time and did not have time to enjoy it.

The waiter seems to have no job and cannot clean up the garbage on the table in time (the dishes dropped on the table when the guests are eating), which is not good for the senses. 2. The waitress wears black stockings with holes in them to work, which does not meet the image standards of a hotel apar**ent. 3. The clothes left by the guests in the restaurant could not be handed over to the front desk in time for registration of lost items. The guests asked the front desk but there was no record at the front desk and they found it after calling the restaurant. Workflow needs to be improved. Thanks again to the front desk staff for the suite upgrade privilege, which made our trip to Chongqing even better.

When you checked in, the hotel also upgraded the room type for free. The room was arranged on the parent-child floor on the 34th floor. There are snacks for the children at the elevator entrance every day. Like, the room The view is very good. You can see part of the river view from the room...

msg:I was traveling with children this time, so I took a long time to choose a hotel. The hotel is in a very good location, with Raffles City Mall downstairs and Metro Line 1 underneath the mall, making travel very convenient. Chef Li Jiang at the entrance of the hotel was very nice and enthusiastic. He took the initiative to help us carry our luggage and give us directions. The young man in the baggage depar**ent and the little girl who checked in were also very good at checking in for the parent-child level. The hotel room is spacious and clean. The room was tidied up in a timely manner. The hotel's toiletries are purely plant-based and have very good cleaning effects. My friend was so obsessed that she had to buy a set. I didn‚Äôt even use the L‚ÄôOccitane I brought with me. There is a capsule coffee machine in the room, and the washing machine and dryer are very practical and come in handy when it rains. The breakfast is basically the same as that of a star hotel. It has Chinese and Western food. The noodles and wontons are good, but the omelette is too old. There is a parent-child playground and a swimming pool and gym on the second floor of the hotel, which children prefer. I really can't fault the hotel. I will recommend it to friends who want to visit Chongqing, and it will be my first choice in the future!

However, the May Day accommodation fee is 1800+ per room per day (including 370 for an extra bed). There is no breakfast and you have to buy it separately. Fortunately, the extra bed in the two rooms comes with a bed and breakfast, and the 5-year-old child eats for free. The author took the little one to the restaurant for breakfast. We do it ourselves with the big ones. Today, I saw that the price of a room is usually only over 800, and I decided not to travel on holidays like May Day in the future.

When we were leaving, the receptionist Chen Dong saw that we had a lot of luggage and took the initiative to help us carry our luggage to the parking lot. I liked it. Then there are the shortcomings: 1. You need to go to the elevator to go to the room, and there are no luggage carts and bellmen. What if the guest brings a lot of luggage? 2. There are not many varieties of breakfast, and the replenishment is not timely. There are many people during the May Day holiday, and the breakfast area is not big and a bit crowded. 3. There is no mini bar, which is the first time in a five-star hotel. 4. Ordered express delivery , the courier said it was left at the front desk, so I went to the front desk and asked for help, but I turned around and went back to ask if I had found it. Looking at the confused look of the beauties at the front desk, I felt that they didn‚Äôt pay attention to this issue at all. Later, I looked for it myself and found that my express delivery was there. There was a storage box next to the elevator, which meant they didn't even look for it for me. I was speechless. 5. The bread I baked in the morning was stuck in the toaster. I kept trying to get it out, but no one helped me. I was responsible for sweeping the door at the same time. The beautiful girl who was stuck silently watched me struggling, ignored me, didn‚Äôt help, didn‚Äôt recruit anyone to help‚Ä¶. I have stayed in many five-star hotels. It is too far-fetched to rate this hotel as five stars. Four stars is more reasonable. Apar**ent hotels are suitable for family travel.

msg:Overall, I think it's a good hotel.
It's not far from the airport, and the location is good, close to tourist attractions. When I took a taxi to the hotel, I was dropped off near the entrance to the Intercontinental in the same building, so if you're not good at Chinese, be careful. It's only about 20 meters away, but it can be a hassle if you have a lot of luggage. The entrance to Ascott is marked, but it may be a little difficult to find if it's your first time using a taxi.
It's directly connected to a commercial facility, so it's convenient for shopping and eating. There's also a Lawson within walking distance.
There is a small facility for children to play in the hotel, which I used several times. The TV seemed to be broken.
The facilities in the room were just right and I had no complaints, but there was a playing card left under the sofa cushion, which may have been left behind by the previous guest. The visible area was clean, but it seemed that the cleaning was not that thorough.
The breakfast was neither good nor bad. It was average for a hotel of this class, and there was nothing particularly memorable. The variety and taste were also good.
During my three nights stay as a tourist, I spent a lot of time in and around the hotel with my two-year-old child, but we had no problems.
The observation deck at the top of the building the hotel is in requires a fee, perhaps because it is operated by a different company.

The only problem with check-in is that the B1 drop-off point does not allow cars to drive in. It is not easy to take a taxi. You often have to go around to pick up a car.

Living in Raffles City is convenient for food, drink, housing and transportation.
The room is large and the kitchen facilities are all available. You can cook your own meals. The only drawback is that the breakfast area is very small and the food supply cannot keep up with the flow of people. There are not many varieties of breakfast. It is recommended not to order a meal and eat outside. The price/performance ratio is not high.
The view of the room at this price is equivalent to no one. It can only be said that it is convenient for more people to stay in a hotel suite with a good environment.

In the hotel lobby, you have to transfer to the elevator once, and then change the elevator to the corresponding floor! There are many hotels designed like this now, but the elevators in this hotel do not have air conditioning. On September 10, 2023, the high temperature was 37 degrees, and the National Meteorological Observatory also issued a yellow high temperature warning. You can imagine what a sweltering experience it is to take the elevator! We booked a suite, but the view was average, with both sides blocked! The wall covering in the room is peeled and yellowed. The bathroom is quite large, but the gray wall tiles are incompatible with the blue bathroom cabinets, making it look particularly empty. Some bathroom windows face the opposite house. If the curtains are not drawn, you will be able to see them. Nothing left! The curtains in the room are not electric and are very laborious to pull. On the day of check-in, there was a fire drill. The experience was not good! By the way, the breakfast the next day was even more basic, with not many seats, few varieties, and poor quality. The omelettes lacked heat! We had 14 breakfasts in total, and only 6 people actually ate breakfast! At 10:30, when I negotiated with the restaurant staff to pack some bread, the waiter had already collected the rest of the food and didn‚Äôt even have a chance to get some bread! Hotels in Chongqing are generally not expensive. If it weren't for the location at Chaotianmen and the Ascott brand, I wouldn't have chosen this hotel! However, the actual check-in experience is not as good as Guangzhou and Macau. I can only say that one time is enough!

Then she put them down and called a man to come. He grabbed a ladder and put it next to our suitcase. When he came down, he stepped on me. I just bought it. We had another pair of shoes to catch the bus the next day, so we asked to change rooms to another room. It was already 5 o'clock, and no one helped us with our luggage. They learned that we were changing rooms and left without catching them... It's quite speechless. When I called, I also claimed that I had pest control work. The next day, I didn't ask about my housing experience. It was the first time I encountered this situation after staying in a hotel for so long. I was very depressed and couldn't sleep well.

Outside the window, we can see Chaotianmen Pier and part of the Yangtze River. The suite is equipped with refrigerators, microwave ovens, coffee machines and other small appliances. The washing machine has a drying machine, so you can wear it the next day after washing that night, which is very convenient. Living here, you can not only enjoy the service of a five-star hotel, but also experience the comfort of home. Very good value for money, very suitable for family vacations.
The location of Ascott is very good. You can go downstairs to Chaotianmen Square, or shop, eat, or watch movies at Raffles.
Many famous scenic spots and places of interest in Chongqing surround the hotel, such as Chaotianmen Wharf, Jiefangbei Commercial District, Yangtze River Cableway and Hongya Cave, etc. It is very convenient to walk for more than ten minutes from the hotel.

msg:It's the first time to stay in the Ascott brand. Its brand is mainly service apar**ents, which are very suitable for families to stay. There are different bedrooms, which do not affect each other, and the experience is very good. When I came to Ascott Chongqing this time, I mainly liked the landmark of Raffles City. The location of the service apar**ent is excellent, and it is very convenient to travel.
    The best thing I experienced was the meticulous service throughout the whole process: from the thoughtful concierge at the moment of getting off the car to the front desk attendant, to the floor butler, and the floor attendant, all of them are enthusiastic and meticulous. This is my family's ten-day trip to Chengdu and Chongqing A hotel with the best service in the accommodation experience, which adds a lot to Ascott. Among them: 1. The concierge JACK CHEN, who happened to be the one we checked in and checked out, kind and serious; 2. Wang Xieqiong, the floor attendant, who can quickly respond to the needs of the guests, has a high sense of responsibility and service awareness; 3. Ms. Bao from the security depar**ent (Helen), responsible for helping us order the evening Shuangjiang tour, answering all questions, saving us from going out to buy tickets ourselves, which is very convenient. 4. After two days of stay, the floor housekeeper will take the initiative to ask about service needs, and the room has a variety of pillows. 5. There is a special area for children to take meals for breakfast, which is the most unique and best among the domestic and international hotels I have been to; the supervisors of the restaurant are also very serious in their work and treat guests very well; 6. Service apar**ents The most pleasant thing is that there are clothes dryers and washing machines in the rooms, which solve our laundry problems during the trip, and the capsule coffee machine is also very pleasant.
    Things to improve: 1. The robot clearly says that it is a 24-hour service. I bought women's sanitary products at 10 o'clock in the evening, and it showed that they were closed. This is a failure; 2. There should be a night light inside; 3. My stay this time It‚Äôs 3211. The shower in the bathroom in the master bedroom didn‚Äôt come out after two minutes. I was taking a shower at the time. It was as embarrassing as it was. When I left the store, I told the concierge to inform the engineering depar**ent, but I was fooled by it. 4. The air conditioner in the living room of 3211 is not working. The room is very cool, but the living room is hot no matter how many degrees or air volume is adjusted. 5. The mirror cabinet in the bathroom seems to be convenient for storing supplies, but in fact, it will touch the head. When you lower your head to wash your face or brush your teeth, you will bump into it. The hotel's design at that time did not consider the actual situation of the guests? ? 6. The position of the towel rack, bath foam, and shower is too high. When designing, you think that the guests are all tall and tall at 1.9 meters? ? Do you not consider whether Chinese women, children, and teenagers are enough? ? ? 7. The hotel responds to the environmental protection and green plan. The guest room is not equipped with six small pieces. We all support it, but can the toothpaste that comes with the toothbrush set several dosages? We are staying for two nights, and we may be more particular about it. After breakfast , I will rinse my mouth at lunch and dinner, that little toothpaste is really not enough. . . .

The river view is unobstructed, and there are basically everything you can imagine in the apar**ent. üòâThe facilities are almost the same as the ones I live in. Go down the subway line 1 and go to the door of Raffles City in front and enter the mall in seven or eight minutes. You can also stroll down to Fushi üòù what do you want for laundry, mineral water and the like. Get off the phone at the front desk, and it will be delivered right away. The service is also good. Breakfast is included in our reservation. I feel that it is a bit expensive to buy 88 per person. There are many specialties of Chongqing noodles for breakfast. This is the central area, the traffic is very congested, and the basic subway travels. If you want to take a taxi, you have to take a detour. You can go to wfc to see the night view at night. The lights are turned on at about 8:30, and you can see Raffles City and the whole of Chongqing.

It is right at Raffles City, the terminus of Metro Line 1. The intersection of Chaotianmen and Liangjiang is just downstairs. There are also two tea shops in the square. Come back to the hotel One cup, not to mention how pleasant it is. Secondly, the front desk of this hotel is super generous. Because I booked the room very late, I could only book two basic room types on different platforms. The girl at the front desk considered the inconvenience of changing our rooms and upgraded them to a twin room with a river view. Look This river view is really fragrant. Next time I come to Chongqing, I am willing to stay at Ascott for the whole trip.

The transportation is very convenient. You can get to the hotel from Exit 2 of Chaotianmen by subway, take the elevator to the LG floor, and go out from Gate 12.
Serve:
Both CI and CO are very fast, and the aunt who cleans the house every day is also very diligent, and 6 bottles of water are replenished every day. The hotel has a feature of robots delivering food to the room, which is very efficient.
Room view:
Staying on the 32nd floor, you can see some river views, because the hotel is located in the middle of the Raffles building complex, which is slightly blocked.
breakfast:
I ate breakfast for four days, which was relatively simple, but it was enough to eat casually.
Room facilities:
The room facilities are quite complete. There are all kinds of appliances in the kitchen, as well as washing machines and dryers. It is very convenient to stay for a short stay, just like at home.
Cost performance:
I think the price/performance ratio is very high, and it is very comfortable to live with children.

1. The overall size of the room is small, with a living room, and the layout is acceptable
2. Moderate price
3. It is in the same building as Raffles shoppingmall. It is very convenient for shopping, eating and massage. Just go downstairs
4. Breakfast is acceptable, matching the price, four-star level
shortcoming:
1. The bath towels are extremely hard and sticky. It is recommended that the hotel needs to replace them immediately
2. The traffic is very, very congested, no matter day or night
3. The air conditioner is too cold, just turn it off
4. The sofa bag smells bad, so it should be cleaned immediately

It is very polite to go to the opposite side of the ticket office where you can buy night tours on the Jialing River. And Dean at the concierge, the gentleman who took us into the room, was also very nice. However, there is a lot of room for improvement in the hotel's breakfast and catering.

In the evening, they called me and told me that I had soiled their quilt cover and I was claiming compensation, and it was hundreds of dollars more. This is the first time I have encountered this situation since traveling. It is true that I touched some oin**ent at night because of the pain in my feet. It was not much, and it was light yellow. I admit that it was stained, but this public product is recycled and it does not matter how many times it is used. I know, I don‚Äôt know what your standards are. After negotiation between all parties, the result was that they couldn‚Äôt ask for money. In the end, the room fee of nearly 3,000 yuan plus nearly 300 yuan in compensation ended the matter! I feel that this series is full of routines, so scary. Things like going out are also lessons. I hope everyone will keep their eyes open and be cautious when staying in other hotels. It is best not to stay, so as not to be taken advantage of and affect your mood.

Several aunts occupied the three seats at the front desk. They did not open the room or register for pure chat. They talked about the last time they stayed at the Intercontinental or here. As a result, we had to wait for them to finish chatting before we could check in.

I went downstairs to check the takeaway and 6-7 pieces of takeaway from other customers lying in the takeaway box and no one arranged for delivery. . . . . . The cleaning of the room is actually pretty clean, but there is obvious adult dirt around the bathroom. It is still hard to accept such a nasty dirt in such a location of a star hotel. I won't choose it next time. Are the parent-child theme rooms and ordinary suites not divided into floors? It started beating at 9 o'clock in the morning, and there were noises of children running. I didn't sleep much all night. It was a crazy night to check in. I was about to call at 12 o'clock and was urged to check out. I would not choose again.

msg:Before going to Chongqing, I checked the hotel reviews on major platforms. Whether it is a five-star hotel, a newly opened one, an Internet celebrity hotel, or a chain hotel, they all have positive and negative reviews. I really don‚Äôt know how to place an order until A friend introduced this apar**ent as a newly opened apar**ent, but there are also bad reviews after checking it, so let‚Äôs try it for the newly opened more than 800 yuan, and temporarily place an order on the high-speed rail. After arriving in Chongqing, I came to the apar**ent after 9 o‚Äôclock in the evening. It was in Raffles City, just outside Gate 5. I went to the front desk to register, and the waiter said, ‚ÄúFor your family of four, let‚Äôs upgrade to an executive two-bedroom suite for free. It‚Äôs more comfortable. . I got the room card No. 2811. It is a big room with a living room, a kitchen, two bathrooms, one of which has a bathtub, and each of the two rooms has a two-meter bed, which is very comfortable. Seeing this situation, put down your things, and immediately go to Ctrip to check if there is room tomorrow? Yes, a twin room costs more than 1,000 yuan, which is super expensive. I checked another Meimou platform, and it was more than 1,000. I used coupons and points, and the deduction was 897, including breakfast for two people. I thought it was ok, booked it, and stayed for two nights.
The room is well-equipped with everything you need, washing machine, dryer, coffee machine, kettle, induction cooker, oven, pot, tableware, dishes, knives and scissors in the kitchen. Everything is very satisfactory!
The downside is that there is a construction site near the hotel, and the sound of the construction can be heard after eight o'clock in the morning. (The hotel provides a pair of 3m earplugs for free.) For our tourists, it is not a big problem, anyway, go out early and return late.
The hotel is busy and quiet. Downstairs is Raffles City. There is everything in the mall. It is open from 10:00 am to 10:00 pm. The hotel staff are also very enthusiastic. They greet each other and ask if you want to store your luggage when you check out, and if you want to help call a taxi. Do you want to help me get something. So I really don't know how the bad reviews got there.
A word of advice, in the kitchen, because there are too many things, the knives and scissors are very sharp. It is recommended to register and use them. If you can get them easily, it is too dangerous.

The upstairs is a viewing platform, which saves the crowds. In the evening, you can also take a walk in the garden downstairs. Below is the Chaotianmen Wharf, where you can watch the confluence of the two rivers without any dead ends. And only residents can use the platform after ten o'clock, so there are almost no people.
Facilities: Ascott feels that the decoration is similar, and there is still a gap between five-star hotels, but it is a hardcover apar**ent, and the area is very large, which is very comfortable for a family to live in. The only thing is that the three-bedroom twin room should be equipped with a TV.
Service: The front desk is enthusiastic. I called in advance to inquire about the house situation, and then arranged the room according to the needs.
Hygiene: The overall is good, but the sewer in the master bedroom bathroom feels a little off-flavored, you can do more to deal with it.

The set one-suite room type is fully equipped according to the functions of the apar**ent.
There are battery stoves, washing machines, refrigerators, and ovens.
It's just that we didn't use it.

The swimming pool is not big, but not many people use it. It is basically reserved.
The children's paradise has been booked twice, but it is more suitable for babies.
The breakfast is quite satisfactory, but it is basically satisfying, and I can't eat much anyway.

The service is really good. Xiao Xu at the front desk also helped to upgrade the room type, and other service staff will also take the initiative to provide help. Chongqing people are generally very enthusiastic! Thumbs up!

Compared with the price of 1600 more per night next door,
Ascott only needs more than 800 a night, so I decided to choose here.
Recommended to friends who want to live near Chaotianmen Jiefangbei!

In the core business district, the rooms are spacious, the facilities are complete, and there are many delicious foods. The comfortable accommodation added a lot to our trip to Chongqing. It is about 20 minutes' walk from Jiefangbei and Hongyadong. Walking can not only avoid traffic jams, but also can be used as a digestion exercise. The only minor problem is that the bathroom doesn't drain very well and the floor tends to collect water when you shower.

After professional training, the placement and arrangement of items are different every day, which highlights the serious loopholes in management training; 3. Catering Depar**ent - the restaurant is small and can be ignored, but the chaos of breakfast management requires the management to think deeply: the use of dishes Failure to replenish the food in time, how to plan an orderly meal plan in a small restaurant, and the waiter‚Äôs skillful answer to the customer‚Äôs question (there is no glass for picking up milk in the morning, but I saw it on the shelf, asked the waiter, and the answer was unexpected) It has not been disinfected for a long time.

We were angry and asked the waiter, but no one was willing to admit that they answered our call. The price is not cheap, but the service is terrible. If we don't call the waiter the next afternoon, no one will come to clean the room. The price is not cheap, but the service is terrible.

The lady at the front desk is very beautiful and speaks very softly. The room is equipped with a microwave, which is very convenient.
Disadvantages: The breakfast food is simple; the bathroom configuration is medium and low, the toilet model is very old and small, and the shower hardware is an ordinary model of Wrigley, which is almost meaningless as a high-end room type priced at 1000-2000. The freezing effect of the refrigerator is not enough. I bought a box of ice cream and it melted overnight.
WIFI is very slow, watching videos is not smooth, the key is that the 5G signal is also average, and there is no desk lamp in the room, friends who need to live broadcast should be careful. Other small problems: the power supply of the telephone line is cut off when touched, and it is barely connected until the coffee table is held up.
As a final reminder, although the executive room has a stove, the space is small, while the deluxe single room has a better view and a large space. Although this room type does not have a stove, it has a microwave oven and tableware, which is very practical.

Helped us to upgrade the room type when the room was not tight. The room is very large, and all kinds of electrical appliances, big and small, are worthy of the name. The hygiene is also cleaned very seriously. For me who is obsessed with cleanliness, I am really grateful! What a great night's rest
I came back late at night and the swimming pool was closed. I went for a swim the next morning because the two girls took a bath too slowly, so I applied for a later check-out. However, the front desk helped us extend it to a little bit when there were many people and the room was tense the next day. Thank you very much üôè
In short, look for Ascott Chongqing Raffles City! Next time you come to Chongqing, you must choose!

I was upgraded to a junior suite when I checked in, but the view from the window of the junior suite was not satisfactory. After some exchanges, although I have made it clear that I can make up the difference, the hotel still gave me a free upgrade to an executive suite with a view of the two rivers. The view is first-class , thank you very much, very satisfied.
The front desk employee Xiao Lu (if I remember correctly) showed me several rooms, up and down, very patient, which made me feel embarrassed, and it is not like other hotels to have good reviews before checking in, That's even more praise, it must be praised!

Of course, it is really necessary to remind that the rooms with open views in the hotel are mainly senior double beds and executive suites. Those who need it should pay attention to it!

The washing machine in the room is very easy to use, and the hygiene is also very good, but! The price/performance ratio is really not high, especially after comparing so many other hotels around here, 400 yuan can also get a good high-altitude river view family room, although there is no one bedroom and one living room. There are two worst things about this place: it was very difficult to find when I first came here. When I accidentally walked in from the mall, I lost my way to death, and the entrance was too hard to find; The building was almost completely blocked. . I made a reservation for two days and another day, and then came in and wanted to stay for one day less. They refused to ask me to pay 300 liquidated damages... Really... There are so many hotels next to you, either stay at 400 or 500 yuan, or stay here. Add some money to live in Intercontinental. This place is indeed for the poor people who pay the company to live.

msg:Advantages: The price is very high, and the geographical location is also very good. Especially the washing machine in the room is quite convenient. The staff and the cleaning aunt are very polite and welcoming, and have not encountered the bad attitude mentioned in other reviews. It‚Äôs very convenient to order takeaway, you can pick it up in the lobby or deliver it to your room by robot.
Inadequacy: We arrived after 15 o'clock, but when we checked in, we were told that the room had not been cleaned. We were holding a pile of luggage, and the front desk staff actually asked us to go to the gym for half an hour before checking in. (First of all, it‚Äôs a problem that we can‚Äôt check in after 15:00; second, can‚Äôt we provide some tea for passengers to rest in the lobby? What is the logic of letting us go to the gym with so many luggages üòÇ)
In addition, we went back to the room at 5 pm the next day. The room was not planned yet, but we were too tired and wanted to wash and sleep for a while, so we had to ask the front desk to change clean towels and give up cleaning (but the towels were delivered quickly at the front desk. The cleaning lady who came here is also very enthusiastic)

After check in, they didn't tell us how to get there, just turn left, we took a detour to the outside platform thinking it was the opposite apartment. Breakfast is pathetic, less than 20 dishes, how to say, it's the 200 yuan Hanting Hotel standard, fried rice is hard, hard! Several grains are connected together and can't be chewed. Totally disappointed, for the same price, can't I stay at InterContinental? ! ! ! I'd rather stay at Marriott Executive. I was really fooled by the picture pinned on Ctrip. Really. Never. Never, stay at an apartment under Raffles, either a hotel or Marriott Executive.

Regarding the location of the hotel, it also belongs to the king's level in Chongqing. It is located at the intersection of the two rivers. You can also see the unique gossip map of the Yangtze River and the Jialing River in the room. Looking at this building from the two rivers cruise ship, you can better understand the characteristics of the building. At night, under the blessing of the building's fa√ßade floodlight, the building appears more vivid and Singaporean. I like it very much, and I like Chongqing more. Will go again if you have a chance

Choose, I hope Ascott in other cities can also have such a good experience. In addition, I would like to thank the staff of the hotel Messi, Yoyo and Eason, the children also like you very much. The downside is that the hotel‚Äôs breakfast is slightly simpler than that of a five-star hotel. I hope to increase the variety of breakfast and the dining area.

The venue is relatively small and there is no place to sit during peak hours. This requires waiters to control the number of people and guide the seats. This may be understaffed.

msg:It's the first time to go to Chongqing with two mothers and two babies. I chose the IELTS Club Deluxe Suite upstairs in Raffles City. I was very satisfied with the room type, equipment and service. I made a meal in it after staying for four nights. It was very convenient to use all the cooking. There are not many types of breakfast, but the quality control is good. The waiter in the restaurant is a little confused in rhythm and has just selected the food and put it on the table to help the baby order noodles. The waiter has already taken my full plate of food and dumped it. ü•∫...It is also very convenient to travel. Raffles City is directly connected to Line 1. The night view of Jialin River is very beautiful when you go out of the hotel. It is not far from Hongyadong Industry. It is very convenient to take a car and travel around. It will be Chongqing next time. First choice for travel.

msg:The two families took their children on a trip and came here after playing for a few days in Chengdu. They booked a two-bedroom suite apar**ent, each room included 4 breakfasts, and the unit price was 1000+/night/room. Because I have children, I choose Ascott with a larger room in the same location. The room is not right for Jiang. The executive room can have a river view. I called the hotel front desk in advance. The executive room is not completely facing the river, so I chose the order room type. Advantages: The location of the hotel is very good above the Raffles City. There is a Raffles City Mall downstairs. The Raffles Intercontinental building is next to it. Chaotianmen Wharf is just outside. It is very convenient to walk back to the hotel directly after taking a cruise at night. Apar**ent-style rooms have a living room, dining table, kitchen, refrigerator, oven, microwave, washing machine, dryer, coffee machine, toaster. Very suitable for families to take their children out. There is a swimming pool on the second floor, where the children played several times. The breakfast is acceptable, not too rich, but they are all well done, the small noodles on the first day, and the wontons on the second day. The bed is comfortable to sleep, we don't like a bed that is too soft, the hardness of this bed suits me very well. I‚Äôm used to bringing my own toiletries, so I won‚Äôt comment on it.

Disadvantages: service awareness is average, others give 5 stars, I only give 3 stars for service.
1. On the day of check-in, for a new customer like me, I didn't see the staff actively smiling. And a man behind me was asked by someone who seemed to be the front desk supervisor to sit down on my left hand and check in. The woman in charge humbled and asked the guest next to me. It sounded like this man is a regular customer üôÑüôÑ and I Until I finished, I didn't see the staff who received me take the initiative to smile or greet me.
2. Ctrip orders include 4 breakfasts per room, why not tell me when I first check-in that your breakfast is served according to the actual occupants? I can only give 6 breakfasts if I provide 6 people? It doesn‚Äôt matter how much this breakfast is. What‚Äôs important is that my experience is not good, you didn‚Äôt inform me in advance. You will wait until I finish it.
3. That night when I was waiting for the elevator to meet the staff at the elevator entrance to deliver something to a Japanese customer, the elevator door opened and bowed and smiled to the Japanese customer, and again: si mi ma sei...! We are not guests? You saw that you met and waited for the elevator together. Shouldn't you take the initiative to smile and greet you and say hello?
4. When checking out, there is an empty seat at the front desk, and the other two positions are being processed. I took the room card and stood in front of the empty seat at the front desk. Your short-haired eldest sister is still focusing on her computer and looked up at me midway. , Continue to look at the computer ‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è, then of course I thought she was a staff who did not go through the procedures at the time. A staff member next to me saw me standing and holding the room card, and asked me, I said check out, so she Called the elder sister with short hair and ears, the elder sister started to handle it for me, and did not ask me to sit down, nor a word of kindness, I really accepted it. Hotel security, restaurant, swimming pool attendants are a little better.
Overall, apart from the service, I am still satisfied with this hotel.

msg:The hotel is very suitable for staying with children. First of all, all the household appliances needed for home are available for washing machine, dryer, refrigerator, microwave, and induction cooker, which are all Siemens, which is very convenient. The room is very big, the little yellow duck theme children like it very much, and the stay is very comfortable. Because of the limited time, there is no experience in the swimming pool and children's playground. Second, the hotel is located in the Raffles business district. Chaotianmen Station on Line 1 is very convenient to walk from outside the hotel or inside the shopping mall. It takes about 15 minutes to walk to Hongya Cave. Third, although there are fewer varieties of breakfast, they are all children's favorites, which is actually enough. Fourth, the service is very good. We live on the 28th floor. The cleaning aunt is very caring and clean. One day I was in a hurry to go out and the dryer did not start smoothly. I told my aunt and found that there was too much room in the room. A drying rack to help dry the clothes. It is highly recommended for families with children.

The location of Raffles City is really excellent, high-rise residential buildings also make the area lively but the rooms are very quiet!

msg:Super invincible! ! ! I have already recommended it to a friend. If a friend wants to visit Chongqing, I definitely recommend the hotel! From the porch to the living room and bedroom to the bathroom are super good! ! ! Very spacious and bright, beautiful and very neat. The master bedroom has a beautiful night view, and there are two sinks and bathtubs. The second bedroom is also super spacious and can sleep two people, and the two-bed bedroom has a bathroom facing the door. In my friend's opinion, the shower place can be used for dancing. In short, it is very spacious and comfortable. The environment is also very good. Go straight downstairs to Raffles City to have a meal and wash your hair, and then walk out of the parking lot to get a beautiful river view. Many people will walk there at night. It is also very convenient to go to the bar, just turn to Intercontinental on the level floor. Food delivery and delivery are super cute and invincible with robots. The cleaning is very, very clean and I actually help to fold the clothes hahahaha. The toiletries are changed every day, including shower gel and shampoo. The only drawback is that there are too many bugs and strange bugs, and there is no soap.

Just because a few of us students pooled money to prepay the full room fee, the full amount was deducted before we checked into the hotel, and we were not willing to negotiate. Ctrip also did nothing and did not help with communication. I regret using this software and am ready to report it to 12315.

msg:A large family went to Chongqing from Chengdu for the weekend and booked a three-bedroom executive suite. I called the hotel one day in advance to ask if I could check in at 1pm, and the answer was yes. So I drove from Chengdu to the hotel early the next morning. When I arrived at the front desk, the employee said very bluntly, no, it must be after 3 o'clock, saying that the rule for reservations is 3 o'clock. After repeated attempts to coordinate without success, I asked for a room to be given to me on time at 3 o'clock, but the hotel actually said that it wouldn't be possible at 3 o'clock? ? ? ! ! I had no choice but to contact Ctrip for coordination. I was told that because the previous guest wanted to pay for a late check-out, I couldn't get the room on time at 3 o'clock. This is really ridiculous. You took the money from the previous customer and also took my money and asked me to wait outside? ? Finally, with the coordination and help of Ctrip, the hotel agreed to give us a one-bedroom room to rest first, and finally waited until 3:30 to give us our room. I have stayed in so many hotels, but the service in this one is really bad. From the front desk staff to the manager, everyone is extremely rude! If it weren't for the fact that a large family needs a larger public space, I would never choose this place again! It would be much better for two people to stay in the intercontinental suite next door!

msg:When I opened the suitcase next to the TV, I smelled a faint smell. I looked around and found two hard-boiled eggs and a kettle with half a bottle of water in the TV cabinet. I called the front desk and the cleaning staff came and removed the eggs. When I took it away and was about to leave, I said, "Don't you disinfect it?" He said it belonged to the previous customer and they didn't pay attention to cleaning it... Boiled eggs won't stink even if they are left for four or five days. Think about how long it takes. Got it! It can be seen that the cleaning of the guest rooms is not thorough at all! (Not to mention the oil fingerprints on the cabinet...) This is still during the epidemic prevention and control period!
I reminded her to bring disinfectant and wipe it off immediately after disinfection. I said the smell was too strong and the children were still in the room. She said they were disinfecting it before we got out. The children were going to sleep soon and they couldn‚Äôt be in a smelly room. Go to sleep, and said that we should go out for half an hour and then come back. I said that is not possible, let's see if there are other rooms and change the room! Ask me to contact the front desk myself. Shouldn't this be a matter of internal communication within the hotel to resolve the issue, rather than the guest being the coordinator in the middle? After I finished speaking, she said she went out to make a phone call, but didn't come back for a long time. The disinfectant was placed in the living room, and the unknown kettle was not taken away either! I can only call the front desk myself and wait for the room change! It took about half an hour to say that a room was available, and I asked someone to check the new room first. We were moving (at this time, I still thought the front desk was able to handle it well). After a while, the person who helped move the luggage came. I was packing my things and holding them in my hand. It was very difficult to open the east and west doors halfway, and the staff at the door kept watching and waiting for me to close the door tightly and come in (not to mention the service staff, even unrelated people would help me when they saw it), and we entered the new room. , as soon as I opened the door, a pungent smell of air freshener hit my face! I asked "Is this air freshener sprayed on?" The answer was "Yes", so the room inspection mentioned before was not an inspection at all, but a simple cover-up!
