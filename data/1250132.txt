msg:First visit to Lanzhou and while I enjoyed the city - the hotel was far overpriced (Double Room - Executive Floor). Paying "Shanghai" prices in Lanzhou in Winter just seems crazy. For the price, I was expecting a 5-star experience, which it wasn't. 
The executive lounge was comfortable, but not well stocked with drinks or snacks. The main lobby has some kind of 'perfume' or fragrance in the air, which was unpleasant. The guest room was excessively warm, even with the windows open. 
HIGH POINT - Breakfast Buffet was outstanding. And the breakfast staff excellent. Housekeeping staff also very friendly, and helpful.

msg:A fantastic stay experience, this hotel is worth it! I just came out of a fantastic stay experience, and my mood is still immersed in a full sense of happiness~ This time I chose this hotel, which is really beyond my imagination!
First of all, the room is super comfortable, and the bed is moderately soft and hard, which makes me sleep well all night. When I woke up in the morning, I opened the curtains, and the sun filled the whole room, and I felt that the whole world was bright~
Breakfast is also a highlight! The rich and diverse food choices of the Western restaurant on the first floor make me, a little foodie, simply can't stop. The service is also super thoughtful. From check-in to check-out, every employee is warm and friendly, which makes me feel the warmth of home. Especially the front desk lady Koala, with a sweet smile and a friendly attitude, is really a pleasure. The location of this hotel is also very convenient, and the surrounding transportation is well developed, which is very convenient for shopping and playing. And the surrounding environment is also beautiful, not far from Yantan Park, it is the flower viewing season, which makes people feel happy~
In short, this stay experience is really great! If you also want to enjoy a fantastic trip, you might as well choose this hotel~ Believe me, you will not be disappointed!

msg:When traveling to Qinghai and Gansu, I continued to choose R&F Wanda Vista, which is close to Wanda Plaza. It is very convenient to eat and drink. It is not far from the Yellow River. People who have fitness habits can try to walk around. The Yellow River is very beautiful. Special thanks to the waiters who manage the vehicles and concierge in front of the hotel. They are conscientious when we go in and out. We also had a buffet dinner in the hotel. The environment is comfortable and the dishes are rich. The service staff is still enthusiastic and enthusiastic, giving the guests a good experience. And Xiaodang, thank her for helping to arrange and adjust the room, so that we can stay comfortably in Lanzhou for two days!

msg:The moment I opened the door, I felt that I had chosen the right place. It is a style that my boyfriend and I both like. The lady at the front desk was as enthusiastic as ever. She provided a one-stop nanny-like service from booking to check-in. She was considerate, attentive and heartwarming. As expected, young people understand young people the best. (I was really happy to be praised by Miss Koala and asked, "Are you still studying?" Hahahaha!) The room is super tidy, super clean and super comfortable. Miss Koala has considered everything, from contact lens care solution to humidifiers and a**osphere lights, and everything from household items. The decoration style of the room is also fresh and refined, and I am going to learn from it for the decoration of the new house. There is also a mini bar in the room, so you can lean against each other lazily with the person you like and watch the night view of Lanzhou. It is so comfortable! There are so many good places that I haven't mentioned yet! Because I am too lazy... I have been dragging my feet on this good review for a long time. I must give a good review to this hotel

msg:I compared several hotels on other apps, and the reviews of this hotel were mixed. I may be a "stubborn person" and I had to find out. I was very satisfied with the service from the concierge opening the car door at the hotel entrance, checking in at the front desk, handling problems at the guest service center, and the housekeeping staff and koala in the lobby. The decoration layout, facilities and equipment of the hotel, and the quality and variety of breakfast are very good. It was an unexpected experience for me! It is so difficult for me, a person with mysophobia, to find an ideal hotel. I really found a treasure. It is very clean and comfortable. The room is very bright and hygienic. The car can be parked downstairs, which is convenient and free. I am super satisfied with the front desk service, which is also very good, and there are guides. I must share it with my friends. I must stay here next time I come. I wish your business is prosperous.

Koala at the lobby station speaks gently and patiently helps me point to the elevator. When the takeaway is delivered, there will be a robot to help deliver it. In particular, I left something behind. The lady called to inform me and helped to send it back. The environment is great, the indoor environment is very design-oriented, and there are beautiful ornaments and flowers under the stairs in the front hall. The transportation is convenient, there is a bus stop outside, and the room also makes people feel warm. It is a very cost-effective hotel. The room is very clean and the service is enthusiastic. The attitude is very friendly, the service is also very good, and to be honest, the room is very good. It is clean and tidy when you enter the house. The room decoration style is very good. It is very comfortable and warm to live in, just like at home. Every layout can feel the care of the housekeeper cleaning. Because of special reasons, I temporarily live outside. This stay is the most comfortable one. The most important thing is that parking is convenient and it is convenient to enter and exit. I strongly recommend Lanzhou R&F Wanda Vista Hotel. I didn't expect to have such a tasteful homestay in Luoyang. It's rare to encounter a five-star hotel with such details. I love it. Next time I come here to play, I'll still come here!

msg:I am an old fan of Wanda Cultural Hotel. The hotel service is very user-friendly, clean, luxurious and grand. The room space is very high, which is in line with the old Chinese saying "rich and powerful". Parking, shopping and travel are also convenient. The room decoration has many Dunhuang elements, such as the murals are mostly the smart ribbons of Dunhuang flying fairies. The restaurant also has a very rich variety of breakfast. The staff is very qualified and professional. They always consider the guests and upgraded my room type. Thank you very much. Next time I come to Lanzhou, I will stay in the high-end, a**ospheric, upscale and clean Wanda Wenhua Hotel. I didn't see Sun Yu this time in Lanzhou, which is a pity.

There is free parking. It is very convenient to travel. I highly recommend it. I like it as soon as I enter the lobby. The room is warm and bright, with a lounge chair, clean and sanitary. You can see Yantan Park opposite the hotel. It is very close to Zhongshan Bridge and Wanda Plaza Valley. After a tiring day of climbing Lanshan Mountain, I took a hot shower and went to the laundry room on the first floor to wash and dry clothes. Dinner was directly on the first floor. The taste was delicious and I had a good sleep. I had a full breakfast on the first floor the next morning. It was super comfortable. The children were reluctant to leave. They said they would stay here next time. Every staff member in the hotel was warm and thoughtful. Koala treated guests like family. When we checked in, we felt like home. We also gave gifts when we left the hotel. Thank you for the hotel! I will recommend it to my family and friends and look forward to coming again next time.

As a frequent traveler, I have high expectations for hotels, but this hotel is undoubtedly one of the most satisfactory ones I have ever stayed in, and I am willing to give it a five-star rating. The location of the hotel is perfect. It is located in the city center and has very convenient transportation. Whether it is taking public transportation or taking a taxi, it is very convenient. There are also many restaurants, cafes and shopping malls near the hotel, which provides great convenience for travelers. I especially like to have a cup of coffee in the nearby cafe in the morning and then walk slowly to the attractions. This feeling is really wonderful. The environment and facilities of the hotel are impressive. Walking into the lobby, you are greeted by an elegant a**osphere, and the decoration style is modern but warm. The front desk staff is friendly and the check-in process is very fast, which saves a lot of time. The hotel rooms are well designed and decorated in a high-end manner.

The bedding and towels are of very high quality and feel very good. The bathroom is equipped with high-end toiletries. The water temperature and water pressure are very stable when taking a bath, and the bath is very comfortable. The sound insulation in the room is also very good. I can hardly hear the noise outside at night, which ensures that I can have a quiet rest environment. The service of the hotel makes me feel warm. During my stay, all the service staff showed a high degree of professionalism and a friendly attitude. From the front desk to the room service, to the waiters in the restaurant, everyone is smiling and willing to help. I once needed to print some documents urgently because of work needs. The hotel staff not only helped me to complete the printing quickly, but also provided binding services attentively, which really made me feel at home. Breakfast is the part I look forward to most every day. The hotel provides a wide variety of breakfasts, including Western bread, cakes, bacon, sausages, Chinese porridge, dim sum and stir-fried dishes, and even a variety of fresh fruits and juices. Every food is very fresh and tastes great, which fully meets my expectations for food. The restaurant environment of the hotel is also very elegant, with good lighting. Enjoying breakfast here in the morning will make you feel particularly good.
In addition to these, the hotel also provides many additional services and facilities, such as free Wi-Fi, gym, swimming pool and business center.

msg:I checked out from a hotel in the middle of the night and transferred to Lanzhou Wanda. I wanted to experience a crown hotel, but when I entered the room, I didn’t feel very good. When I hesitated, I waited for the room attendant to bring me toiletries. I was told that for environmental reasons, the crown hotel did not provide toiletries, but the customer requested it. can be provided. When I saw the toiletries in paper bags, I felt like they were three- or two-star products, so I decided to change hotels. The service of a crown hotel is really good. They didn't embarrass me at all and directly handled the check-out procedure for me.

My decision was right. Wanda gave me two days of free breakfast for arriving in the early morning. What makes me want to stay in Lanzhou Wanda again is that Lanzhou Wanda is one of the few hotels that has the rooms, facilities and services to match the magnificent front desk. If the free breakfast makes me happy, then the room attendant makes me feel warm! The room attendant provided me with three bottles of mineral water, probably because he saw me drink up all the two bottles of water in the room; and I had uneaten oranges and eaten orange peels in a bag, and the room attendant even helped me I cleaned the orange peel and left only the orange in the bag. The breakfast waiter reminded me to get more food because I was a little late. 10 minutes before the meal was collected, the restaurant waiter nicely reminded every customer to get more food.

I rarely comment on a hotel in such a long way, but this is my second time staying at Lanzhou Wanda. I have to say that Lanzhou Wanda has a unique cultural heritage, which is reflected in the flying sky on the bedside. It is no less than the room at the front desk and with it. The matching human service has made me full of praise and it has become my first choice in Lanzhou.

Any hotel's air-conditioning, heating or natural ventilation is the choice of our guests, right? Why did your system arbitrarily change to centrally transport natural wind? The key is that your air supply is still small. The whole house is only the window where I took the picture. It is stuffy and hot when I sleep at night! At least come and change your sleeping blanket. The temperature is 26℃ in Lanzhou where the temperature difference is huge in autumn. If you don’t cover yourself with a quilt, you will get cold within a few minutes. If you cover yourself with a quilt, you will wake up with sweating and heat. Do you have any cost savings like this? hateful! In a five-star hotel, the TV does not have smart screen projection. Why am I spending so much money to suffer? ! After staying for four nights, this problem has not been solved. Your management should reflect on the replacement and stop blaming the employees! This experience was very bad. I would like to remind everyone to check whether their air conditioning system has been improved before checking in. Otherwise, don’t stay here! gas**!

Not too big. The hotel is in a good location. There are various supermarkets not far away.
However, the hotel's breakfast is average. The bread and pastries on the dessert table still have a lot of room for improvement. There are not enough other food choices. I'm a bit sorry for the breakfast price.

msg:I stay here every Spring Festival. The hotel's hardware is first-rate and the service is timely. However, the communication between the front desk staff and customers is insufficient. I will write down my experience to remind future guests. We stayed for three nights this time. When we checked in, we inquired about breakfast. We were informed that we had to book a reservation a day in advance for RMB 80 per person, and go directly to the restaurant for RMB 128 without making a reservation. Because we had an early flight on the third day, I said I would book two breakfasts for the next day. After my family had it the next day, they felt that the quality of the breakfast had declined compared to before, so we did not continue having breakfast at the hotel. When I checked out, I found that the hotel had charged two breakfasts for two days. After consultation, I learned that the hotel thought I had booked two breakfasts for two days when I checked in, so it deducted the money directly. However, I thought I had only booked and eaten one day. For breakfast, I did not make a reservation or have breakfast the next day. The front desk did not clearly inform the customer that the payment would be deducted when the reservation was made, so I was surprised when I saw the bill. This was a reminder to subsequent guests.

msg:Due to some minor incidents that occurred in Dunhuang a few days ago, and the special forces tour that caused some of my travel companions to feel unwell, I canceled the trip to Xining and went directly back to Lanzhou to stay one more night. Since I haven’t stayed in a Wanda hotel yet. I temporarily booked Wanda to experience it. Maybe it's because there are still too few hotel options in northwest China. When I arrived at the hotel, it finally felt like a four- or five-star hotel. From the service, environment and catering, I feel like I can have a good rest in the hotel.

Facilities: Not very new. The faucet and shower in the bathtub will flow together when turned on, and the shower in the bathtub will leak. However, the shower room has a large shower head and a ceiling shower, which makes it feel very safe.

Environment: A normal five-star configuration. They will proactively provide guidance and help. The chandelier in the elevator is a bit scary and seems to be a safety hazard. The crystal chandelier shakes greatly when going up and down.
Catering: The breakfast is quite rich and tastes good. When we arrived on the first day, we experienced the Chinese restaurant and the Western dinner buffet respectively. I heard that there was also a lottery for the dinner buffet. I bought a group meal from a Chinese restaurant. The portion was large and the service was good. It was not expensive. I like it.

Service: The front desk and restaurant services are very good. There is a hair salon next to the gym, but the gym's guidance attitude is average. Instead of proactively telling you which door to go in, it will tell you indifferently where you should go if you go wrong, which will reduce your points.

Overall, I would recommend others to come here just because the toilet can be completely blocked from light. There are really too many hotels in the northwest with toilets and showers without privacy, and they have not considered the issue of traveling with family members at all.

As a result, the previous guest in the room had not checked out yet, so we were arranged to stay in another room first. Rest and wait until things are sorted out before changing rooms. Since the room has not been processed, we told the hotel to come back in the evening to get the room card when we were going out at night. I came back in the evening and took the room card to the room. The parent-child themed room was not as good as a regular double room. There was no picture introduction, and the water in the room was only charged. The children's toiletries and slippers were delivered after calling the front desk. All supplies are not theme-co-branded.

msg:The worst hotel I have ever stayed in. Because we had children, we booked a double bed of 1.35 meters. As a result, after my husband checked in, he went to put his things and found that the bed was small. He called the front desk, and the front desk replied that our twin beds were both 1.35 meters tall. My husband thought we would just make it happen. At 11pm we came back from playing with the baby. I was dumbfounded. The bed was not even 1.2 meters tall. My baby was 1.4 meters tall and was lying on it with his knees hanging out. I decisively called him to let him go. They used a ruler to measure it themselves, and the front desk said it would be changed and that they could also upgrade to a suite. I still chose a double bed. After a few minutes, the double bed was 1.35, which was obviously much larger. And after communicating with the front desk, I learned that their hotel did have one. Twin beds are all small beds, but online prices are 1.35. It is obviously a false sale. Wanda Vista is considered one of the top hotels in Lanzhou. Let’s not talk about the hardware facilities. The most basic honest hospitality cannot be done. It is indeed below the standard. In addition, when we checked out, the deposit was stated The payment arrived in one to two hours. I didn't receive a call after three hours to ask the front desk. The front desk said it hadn't been processed yet... Finally, the breakfast was particularly unpalatable. Except for the bowl of beef noodles, it was the same as the one we stayed in Tianshui the night before. 400 yuan is a huge difference to a hotel.

There was also a shuttle bus to pick her up and drop her off rain or shine. I loved it. I was in such a hurry that I forgot to take pictures. The hotel was amazing. As expected, first of all, the service attitude was very good. After parking the car, the concierge carried the suitcase for me. The service attitude at the front desk was also very good, and it was delivered to the elevator. When you enter the hotel, the environment is just like the photos, clean and well designed. All in all, a very satisfying stay. The room is large and very clean. The room has a strong sense of design. My son always said it was a designer hotel because it was different from the ones we had stayed in before. The hotel puts snacks and drinks in the small refrigerator every day. When we open it after playing every day, it feels like a surprise, like a gift from Santa Claus. The service is super good, beyond expectations. It provides some desserts, sodas, teas and fruits. Sound insulation: very quiet. I usually sleep very lightly, but I can't hear the sound from the corridor and next door at all. It's very good. Location: close to the subway station It's very close and convenient. There are a lot of delicious food in Wanda Plaza next to it. Finally, I would like to give a thumbs up to the lady at the front desk who helped check out on the last day. Her service attitude was very good and considerate. The service was really good. The room was clean and the service was attentive. The car was very attentive. I gave the service staff a hundred likes when I picked up the car. I will definitely continue to patronize the hotel next time I come to Shanghai. The boss must give the guy at the front desk a raise. His service attitude was really good. He gave us a delicious meal in the Chinese restaurant. The biggest feeling is that the food is affordable. A portion of stir-fried yellow beef, there was a lot of meat and it was a very big piece, which was very touching. The deboned meat is also delicious. The stir-fried seasonal vegetables are water spinach, which is delicious. The preserved eggs are also delicious. Very positive review. I wanted to eat hot pot the next day, and the buffet restaurant happened to have it. Overall, it was very satisfying. The ingredients are still very fresh, the meat is a must-order, the quality of the meat is good, and the vegetarian dishes are fresh and clean.

It is indeed as the online reviews said, the transportation is convenient and the surrounding shopping malls are convenient for shopping. But the surprise of my stay is that the hotel rooms are very clean, the staff are very enthusiastic, and there is work right after entering the hotel. The staff greeted you, and the waiter also took the initiative to introduce herself when I arrived on the floor, telling me to tell her if I needed anything. When I checked out, I met another waiter on the floor. She asked me enthusiastically if I had checked out, and reminded me not to forget anything. Do you have anything? Making nucleic acid makes people feel warm, without the loneliness of a stranger. This can be regarded as a pleasant accommodation trip in Lanzhou.

msg:Lanzhou R&F Wanda Vista Hotel should be the worst Wanda hotel I have ever stayed in. There are tricks everywhere. They use Wanda’s brand to defraud consumers. They just started selling a 5,900 card that recommends you apply for it. The card includes free room coupons and five Discount coupon, this coupon can only be used during their off-season when no one is staying. During their peak season, when you use 50% off coupons and free coupons, they will tell you that you cannot use them, and they will tell you with a very bad attitude that the rooms are full and they will either accept the price at the front desk or not book a room for you.
After I reserved a room, the reservation depar**ent called me and said that there were few rooms on weekends and I had to pay the room fee first. I told me to use a 50% discount coupon, and then told me that there were no rooms.

此外，前廳服務還提供了及時和周到的幫助。每當我有任何問題或需要，他們總是樂於給予幫助並提供解決方案。無論是預訂餐廳、安排租車還是解答旅遊諮詢，他們總是能夠給予我最好的建議和推薦。

最令我難以忘懷的是他們對細節的關注和注意。他們始終保持着整潔、整齊的外觀，確保前廳的環境始終處於舒適和温馨的狀態。我的行李總是安全地送達到房間，並放置在我指定的位置上，這讓我感到非常貼心和滿意。

總的來説，這家五星級酒店的前廳服務無可挑剔。他們始終以熱情、專業和周到的態度為客人服務，讓人倍感賓至如歸。我強烈推薦這家酒店給所有尋求出色服務和舒適體驗的旅客。

特別誇一下西餐廳，自助餐的水平真的是酒店餐飲界的頂尖了，品類豐富，口味傑出。
這次出行，因為一個優秀的酒店而事半功倍！！！！！

最後還發現 這門口是機場✈️大巴🚌停靠點… 太方便了。   設施雖然是2014年，但是保養還不錯👍   加油👍 再次感謝黃萌姑娘。

酒店旁邊就是萬達商城華潤超市，吃飯買日常用品都十分方便。
真要説不足，就是吐槽客房點餐服務。房間裏都有放點餐二維碼，但是卻不能用，這個有待改進哦

美中不足：
1.房間電源插座松曠嚴重，充電器鬆手就會掉落，幾乎失去了充電功能，這是唯一讓人鬧心的事情。
2.餐廳咖啡機可能是因為使用量大，使用完後沒有及時跟進擦拭奶漬，影響整體體驗。

整體而言推薦入住體驗
