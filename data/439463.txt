It looked fully renovated, fresh scent and carpet smell. My room was very big and clean and looked like I was the first one to use it. It had that fresh smell

They could change the breakfast times to times and add more options for halal/muslims customers.
Overall they have a lot of options in breakfast too

Cleaning was spot on and location is very near to all restaurants and shops. 

Multiple Canton Fair shuttle a day to pick you up and drop you back to hotel

Swimming and gym was also very nice 

I would use it again for sure but only if it’s 35th floor and above

This is the place to stay if you want a real feel for the warmth & charm of Rome & its people instead of a cold impersonal hotel. The owners & staff make you feel like part of their family and give wonderful support in every need of your visit ex. tours.& transportation. They speak very good English and their breakfast & coffee are excellent and will accommodate any request if possible. 

Excellent location, superb services, helpful staff, waht else do you need? Will definitely come again to this place. 

Very satisfied with the cleanliness of the hotel, the size of the room, the helpfulness of the staff at the front desk (all of them during our stay), they even go out of their way to guide you through the places to visit in Rome. The breakfast was to our expectation. The area is central even if one wishes to walk around. The only thing is that the room is hot, does not have enough light and no air comes in even if you open the window as it is sourrounded by buildings.

I stayed here to save money after staying at the Langham and Ritz-Carlton. Echo was very friendly and showed me around the hotel. I like the window views of the restaurant even though I did not eat here. The staff gave me directions to take a Covid test which was very helpful and also helped me figure out how to find my test results in Wechat from the previous day which helped me a lot.

msg:I am in Room 2817. I want to report a weird acoustic sound. This is why I gave only three in "Facilities."

There is mid frequency (higher than what people would call rumble; low enough to feel the effect active noise cancellation of Bose QC20; more like pure sinusoidal tone type of sound, not white/pink noise type sound) constant acoustic noise. As I move my head, the noise disappears or appears - typical for a single tone wave in a room -. I could not find a specific equipment  (TV or lamp) that is generating this acoustic sound.

I did not request room change, as other rooms in the hotel building may have the same noise. It is not terribly loud, but it is definitely disturbing, not expected in a 5 star hotel.

The attached sound spectrum showing a peak in 700 - 800 Hz is from REW software with the built-in mic and sound card on my Huawei Matebook E.

msg:The hotel is located in Yuexiu District. It takes about an hour to get to the hotel by subway from Guangzhou South Station, and about half an hour to get to the hotel by subway from Guangzhou East Station. Turn left and walk about 100 meters from the hotel. The subway is just across the road. The transportation is quite convenient.
The hotel front desk service is very good. They said that they helped us upgrade the room and live on the 36th floor, which is relatively quiet. However, the room is a bit small. We booked a business king room with a size of 36 square meters, but the current room is only about 20 square meters. There is a sink next to the bed, and a bathtub is placed in an open position across the sink. There is a toilet on the left side of the blue door and a bathroom on the right side. Because it is connected to the room, the light cannot be left on at night, otherwise it will be too bright when sleeping on the bed. Fortunately, I brought a night light.
Personally, I think this is one of the highlights of the hotel. This is the brightest room I have lived in so far. Most hotel rooms like to be extremely dim. Now most of the people who go out to play are families, both old and young. Are all the hotels receiving couples? Even if they are in a proper relationship, they will not like it to be darker, nor do they want to do sneaky things. As for the mood, it is not called mood when the lights are turned off.
The hotel is very good overall, with many foreigners. Because we went out for morning tea in the morning, we booked a room without breakfast, so I don't know about the hotel breakfast. It was nice to sit in the hotel room and look at the scenery outside.

Even though the weather in Guangzhou is gloomy during the Tomb Sweeping Day, the hotel’s floors are well set up and it’s close to Baiyun Mountain, making it interesting to find bits of spring scenery in the gray concrete forest.

Among them, I must thank Ashely (Lin Cuiling) who checked in. In addition to upgrading my room because of my Ctrip platinum rights, after learning that this check-in was for an elderly family member who came back from Hong Kong to clear the country, she specially arranged two adjacent rooms. So that we can look out for each other. These service details fully reflect the service level of Guangzhou's established five-star hotels and the management's emphasis on daily services.

Finally, I will look forward to the next encounter and hope that every journey will be equally comfortable and enjoyable.
Thank you Yajiu for your sincere service.

Sincerely appreciate to team of Asian International Hotel, specially to FrontOffice Team as Reception and Concierge. Receptionist Ashely Lin and Bells are the most remarkable for this trip from Arrival to Departure. Besides the room upgrade according to my member benefits, teams assigned my family to a side to side rooms so that we could gather more. Such details touch us a lot.
As one of the Best Five-Stars Hotels in Canton, I’m always looking forwards to return and share more special moments here!

The breakfast in a five-star hotel is worse than that in a two-star hotel! There are no words to describe it. Most of the breakfast plates were empty.

There are several restaurants in the hotel, and they all look good, but due to time constraints, which one I didn’t try it, so I might give it a try next time. The swimming pool in the hotel is also good. Opposite the hotel is Taotaoju. The Sichuan cuisine of Aqiang’s restaurant next to it is delicious and the price is affordable. The most amazing thing is Maoxuewang. The cold dishes are also good. About one kilometer north of the hotel is Luhu Park. It is very enjoyable to take a walk when you have time.

The design of the swimming pool is a bit strange and there is no water channel, because I brought I couldn't go to the deep water area with my child, and they insisted that I didn't swim according to what they thought, which affected other people. There were four people in the pool, including my child and me, and they had to talk to me for a long time, which made me speechless. Moreover, the overall environment of the swimming pool is also very average, and the water will be very cold when you get out of it.

During the process, Mr. Li Jia, the manager of the lobby, let me deeply appreciate his positive enthusiasm, cautious attitude and wholehearted devotion.
Let us feel at ease even if we lose something!
Here I would like to thank Mr. Li Jia, the lobby manager of Asia International Hotel, and all the staff in the hotel, you are really great!
This trip gave me a 100% favorable impression of the White Swan Hotel Group,
Just checked, White Swan Hotel Group has hotels in many places.

msg:Elite twin room, the room is large enough, has card slots, and is comfortable. Warm reminder that the beds are 1.35 meters long but cannot be pushed together.
Check-in was slow and the waiting time was long.
Since there were two room cards, I randomly gave one to the children after going out for dinner and asked them to go back first. It turned out that there was something wrong with the card and I couldn't get any power at all. The child called the lobby manager and said he would send someone upstairs to check. Then, the children waited in the room with the door open for more than ten minutes, but no one came. When they called again, the line was always busy. Because we were worried, we took a taxi back and used another card to get electricity. Although the problem was resolved on its own, no one from the hotel came to check on the room all night, and no one called to learn about the situation. It’s like I didn’t answer the phone and didn’t know anything about it. Is this a service that a five-star hotel should have?

Management and service? You have a bad attitude. Even if you can't stop it, why don't you inform the guest in advance, adjust in advance, and stay away from the noisy room? If the guest complains, it's still the guest's fault. I don’t feel your external coordination efforts or internal comfort efforts. I just feel tired of customer complaints!

1. I originally ordered breakfast for two, but after eating it once, I immediately changed the breakfast for the second night to one without breakfast. The so-called revolving restaurant mainly focuses on revolving, and there is nothing to eat. The market price is still 148/person.
2. The waiter was standing in front of me and couldn't move. A certain manager in different clothes came out. As soon as I called, the waiter came over immediately.
3. It is known as an international restaurant, but there are still many foreigners. Unfortunately, the waiters do not speak English and they dare not go there, which will embarrass the country~
4. Communication at the front desk is not smooth and customers’ needs cannot be understood~

Shrimp Dumpling Girl and Tao Taoju are both within walking distance. It should have been an excellent five-star hotel 30 years ago. But today, although the price is relatively cheap, the overall hardware facilities and software services are not very ideal, and the room is old and dirty visible to the naked eye. I was scratched and bled by the clip on the hanger at night, and I called to ask for a Band-Aid, but the wound was almost blood clotted when it was delivered. Next time I might choose the Baiyun Hotel next to it or the more expensive Garden Hotel and Crown.

However, there are many black people in that area, so you can usually see several of them every time, and you pass under the elevated highway. The road is a bit troublesome

Service: I am very satisfied with the service. The front desk was very attentive and thoughtful during check-in and check-out, which is what a five-star performance should be.

Hygiene: In terms of hygiene, I feel that the cleaning is not very serious. Basically, it is just two bottles of water, a toothbrush and a quilt. It takes only one minute.

Facilities: The facilities in the suite are even worse. The refrigerator and microwave are just decorations.

Overall, I hope the hotel can be improved if I have the chance to stay next time.

Environment: The hotel is a little old, but it has also done some renovations. The public environment such as the lobby is still good. The water in the bathroom and bathroom in the room is not very good, and the sink is a little leaky, causing the ground to be wet. There are many restaurants around, and there are several in the hotel. Jiangshan in the hotel and Xingyue next to it have been open for many years. There are Tao Tao Ju and Haidilao on the opposite road. There is a Poly Time on the right hand side of the hotel and there is a lot of food in it. There is a bistro on the 27th floor of the Golden Eagle Building on the left side of the hotel, which is a 5-minute walk to the left. We were pleasantly surprised.

Service: The waiters are courteous, and there are many procedures that need to be cooperated during the epidemic, and they will answer them one by one patiently. But to give a small suggestion, one information sheet per person is really not environmentally friendly. Can we use online registration to collect information? (In fact, Suikang code, Yuekang code, and itinerary code have all the information)

Facilities: There are basically everything in the room. It would be better if there was a charging plug at the head of the bed. After all, it is an old-fashioned hotel, so it cannot be compared with the standard of a new hotel.

Good location, convenient transportation, will stay again.

msg:The old five-star hotel has a good environment and has everything that a five-star hotel should have. During the Spring Festival, the price of booking on Ctrip is less than 400, which is not too expensive. The most important thing is that this is the only one I have seen with a double bed of 1.35 meters. The other hotels I have seen are all 1.2 meters. Moreover, extra beds are allowed. Two adults and two children can stay in one room. The price/performance ratio is good. The Xiaobei subway station is 300 meters away from the hotel, which is very convenient.

Changed the room, but it was also a small space with a smell of cigarettes. The room card was degaussed suddenly, saying that the waiter was sent to open the door and waited for a long time but did not come, and finally went downstairs to the front desk by himself. Dozens of flights of stairs are slow. Occasionally there is a toilet smell in the breakfast room

Regarding the service, the price increases during the Spring Festival, and it takes about half an hour for each delivery. The only advantage of breakfast is the revolving restaurant on the roof itself. The scenery is good, but the quality and quantity of the dishes are still disappointing. The biggest surprise was that the lights in the room were out of control, and the lights in the bathroom couldn't be turned on. The master came to fix it for more than two hours without any results, and then made a temporary light source, which made it very late to wash and rest. In the end, I asked for a part of the room fee to be reduced or exempted to no avail. I just compensated some small gifts and was not satisfied with the result. In short, there is a big gap with the expectation of staying in this five-star hotel. !

When I checked in, the front desk said that the upgrade to the executive suite cost nearly 100 square meters. At that time, I thought it was worth the hundreds of dollars. After I actually checked in, I found that the upgraded room was on the 42nd floor and close to the elevator. It can be said that almost no one wants this room. Room. The decoration is old, the air conditioner is not working, the phone is broken, and more importantly, because it is close to the elevator, there is a continuous elevator whistle (like a horror movie). It was still evident after a subsequent phone call to the hotel and the closing of both elevators at 11:30pm. The complaint against Ctrip is that the so-called package has been suspected of fraud, and the room price increase package that cannot be sold will be sold easily.

There is no big problem. The front desk processing speed is relatively slow. In this regard, it is not as good as the next one. The Baiyun Hotel is far away. There are not many places to eat nearby, but there are also several restaurants with a good reputation.

I couldn't enter the room even after opening a room card four times. Finally, it was said that the door lock was broken and the room was changed. I didn’t want to comment. When the payment was settled, the front desk refunded all the money. Halfway through I received a fixed line that showed the remarks of the harassing call. I called it seven or eight times. I stopped calling and finally picked it up. It felt like a liar. After I knew my intention, I paid the hotel again. Before and after, this hotel cannot be called a five-star hotel, no matter what the room or what it does, the Express Hotel will not make this kind of problem!

The equipment is relatively new, it should be just refurbished, but the effect of the new decoration is average: 1) The socket in front of the computer desk is a Hong Kong-style 3-hole horizontal socket, just one. I’m sorry, the domestic 2-hole socket is not wide enough. Do not go in; 2) The socket of the floor lamp does not have electricity, the lamp does not turn on after a test, and the mobile phone has no electricity; 3) The curtains are electric, sorry, the switch can only control the blackout curtain, the more transparent curtain needs to be pulled , And then it will be electric and magical operation; 4) The bathtub is super short and shallow. The needs of the children have been fully considered, I think it should be used by the children; 5) The magical wifi, this room cannot be used ( Other rooms don’t know), the wifi web connection interface shows that it is logged in, but the computer and mobile phone can’t be connected, although the box shows that the network status is "GOOD".

The soundproofing is well done. Although the room is close to the side of the road, the sound of traffic is hardly heard.

Overall: If you just stay for one night, don't ask for too much, but the price is acceptable. The rest did not realize too much.

msg:I'm so angry. I have never stayed in such a bad so-called "five-star" hotel. The attitude of all the staff in handling things is really perfunctory and bad. Standing at the door outside the room, I could hear calling the front desk to arrange someone to come over and confirm and then told me to contact the maintenance depar**ent and then left. Without any apology or solution, let us wait in the room for the maintenance staff to come and say yes Because of the noise from the equipment downstairs, I would like to ask why such a loud noise should be arranged for guests to stay in this room? There is no explanation or apology. Finally, I called the front desk and asked to change the room. After waiting for dozens of minutes, the individual came in and asked me "Should I change the room?" There was still no sorry sentence and the attitude was reluctant. Very disgusting, I really want to be pissed off. The attitude of handling small things for thirty or forty minutes shows how garbage the hotel is. I generally don't comment on it. I can't bear it. I really don't come to live for lightning protection! ! ! ! Changed a room. The voice of the aunt cleaning the vacuum cleaner at the door. The voice of talking and chatting was noisy from the entire corridor to the room. The soundproofing was disgusting and home! ! ! ! The toilet will also be inexplicably flushing by itself, which can scare people to death. The facilities are old and bad! ! ! ! ! ! Don't come, run away! ! ! I haven't waited for an apology until now! Staying in a hotel is just for a good sleeping environment. I can't do it well on such a basic basis. It also claims to be a five-star. I've been cheated again.
🔔Service: It's bad to die! !

I'm so mad ah ah ah ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, the video is recorded below to feel for yourself, the recording is not half of what I feel. I was awakened after sleeping for two hours. I really want to ask the hotel how this noise makes people sleep? Why should we arrange this kind of room for our guests? Why won't you apologize? Is it so slow to deal with problems? Why is the attitude so bad? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? I'm really speechless and feel like vomiting

msg:The worst hotel in Guangzhou is the Asia International Hotel, a five-star hotel, a den of bandits! ! The front desk clerk is not human at all, cold and ghost-like! If you ask anything, you will find Ctrip! For the room I booked, it’s fine to enter the room with my ID card and take my photo, but suddenly the secret is leaked to you, stunned, it’s simply inhuman! The key is that there is no way to check in at night. The next day happened to have a change in the itinerary. I also proposed a refund for the next day’s stay. I disagreed with the refund. There are such bandits in this era! ! Whoever enters will be unlucky. I advise the general public to open their eyes and never stay in this rubbish funeral home! !
