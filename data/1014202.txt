There are simple kitchen equipment to make coffee, hot breakfast and so on. The service was very good. It was too hot in Shanghai. We hid in the room and didn't go out. The staff who cleaned the room warmly called and asked when it was convenient to clean. Because there is a sink in the open kitchen, there is a smell of the floor drain, so I told her and helped us deal with it. The disadvantage is that the apar**ent is a bit old, the facilities are outdated, there are few power plugs, and the floor drain smells bad.

To be more specific: I stayed for two days, and when I first arrived in the room, there was a faint musty smell and an unstable smell in the bathroom. , did not have a good rest; the service awareness of the doorman is very weak, and he will not take the initiative to help guests with luggage; the attitude of the front desk is acceptable, and I refunded my one-day fee, but the front desk also feels very powerless.

Before leaving, he whispered sb. I can only complain to him by Ctrip. His name is Hubert. I don't know how this kind of person can be a lobby manager. In addition, when queuing, I saw that the uncle in front was rejected by the waiter for his slow movements, and the language was very ironic. In short, this kind of hotel really pulls down the appearance of the entire Shanghai waiter, I don’t know how much, it’s very embarrassing
