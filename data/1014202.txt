There are simple kitchen equipment to make coffee, hot breakfast and so on. The service was very good. It was too hot in Shanghai. We hid in the room and didn't go out. The staff who cleaned the room warmly called and asked when it was convenient to clean. Because there is a sink in the open kitchen, there is a smell of the floor drain, so I told her and helped us deal with it. The disadvantage is that the apar**ent is a bit old, the facilities are outdated, there are few power plugs, and the floor drain smells bad.
