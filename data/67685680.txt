The hotel's location is also excellent, with a subway entrance located just downstairs. The surrounding environment is quiet and convenient, making it the perfect location for a business trip.

Nevertheless, the staff were professional, efficient and courteous.  The rooms were very clean and well appointed.  Bathroom facilities were great, clean and with strong water pressure.  Location was convenient, immediately above a MTR station, although access by walking was confusing at first due to upper and lower lobbies and the construction going on outside which blocked off a road.  The buffet breakfast is OK.  Great views from the sky lobby, the room and the cafe/ lounge area.

msg:When I was a child, Crowne Plaza always left me with a somewhat old-fashioned and retro impression, just like the Crowne Plaza in Saipan, which is a typical example, so that when I grew up, I rarely chose this brand...
But by chance, I stayed at Crowne Plaza this time, and its elegant decoration style refreshed me. The design language of the hotel, including the location, makes people feel that it is very suitable for the contemporary young generation.
In addition, I want to emphasize the praise of the hotel's services, which have effectively implemented the experience of making guests feel at home.
Whether it is the front desk, the butler, or everyone in the concierge and housekeeping department, they all have higher professional qualities and enthusiastic service attitudes than other peers!
I would also like to thank the butler here. In seconds, whether it is alcohol or Band-Aid, it can be delivered immediately.
In fact, what I want to say is that these services are originally necessary for hotels of the same level, but to be fair, there are not many that can really be implemented like Crowne Plaza.
Anyway, I hope your group can maintain and carry forward this! And I would like to thank every hotel employee in every department who works silently and enthusiastically demonstrates their professional qualities even in the dull and boring days!

There is also a 7-11 downstairs (but it seems to be open only until 10pm). In short, it is very convenient to travel.

Although I often passed by it before, I never stayed there.
I wanted to give it a try this time
It really gave me a very good feeling!
The room was very clean, and they helped me tidy up the mess (thank you very much)
It was very spacious, the bed was very comfortable, and most importantly, there was an iron, which was very necessary for business trips!
For breakfast, I hope there could be more varieties, and the taste felt lighter hahaha!
The service was very good, making me feel like a spring breeze. I left something in the middle, and they responded immediately. Thanks to Esme, Vina and Amanda

🛏【️Check-in guide for Crowne Plaza Shenzhen Shenzhen】

📌 Hotel Overview

1. Hotel comprehensive recommendation index (out of five stars): five stars;
2. Comprehensive evaluation (highlights, shortcomings, regrets): All five Crowne Plaza hotels in Shenzhen have been visited: Good Day CP’s breakfast is the best among the five; Landmark is one of the 121 Crowne Plaza brand hotels in Greater China. The only suite CP in China; Longgang Pearl River CP still needs more efforts; International Convention and Exhibition Center CP hardware is super new; Shenzhen Railway CP is close to Shenzhen University and Science and Technology Park. The parent-child rooms are warm and comfortable, and the floor-to-ceiling windows have a good view. It is well-deserved among the top 11 hotels in Shenzhen 1 (This is for reference only. After all, everyone has different thinking perspectives. Commenting on the quality of a hotel is actually a very subjective matter. The beholder has different opinions and the wise have different opinions).

🏨 About the room In Room

1. Welcome gift and upgrade benefits (whether the trea**ent is good or not): A friend of mine said that the most cost-effective business hotel in Shenzhen is Shenzhen Railway CP. This is true. The shape of the welcome dessert is cute and cute, implying the renewal of everything and full of sincerity. The hotel upgraded us to the smallest suite in the suite (of course, compared to our initial reservation, I paid the extra upgrade price difference, not the Overlord meal, haha). The area is small, but very cozy. The guest room is equipped with a three-dimensional automatic ironing machine. I have used this rare configuration before at a Holiday Inn Express in Chengdu (the largest HIX suite is used by the general manager as a permanent resident, and I made an exception that day to experience it). The machine allows regular residents to completely get rid of the inconvenient troubles of washing, drying and ironing. It is a very suitable setting. Of course, it also increases the purchase cost virtually and is not suitable for widespread use in stores across the country. Similarly, capsules The same is true for coffee machines. It is still suitable for each hotel to decide according to its own situation (this point, Hyatt VS BTG's Yi Fei is forcing every store and every room type to have a Nespresso capsule coffee machine and As for Pi Ye Capsule, Tianjin Eye Yifei will also open next month. It is Yifei’s 38th store. I’m looking forward to it... uh, I’m going too far... stop it!);
2. Evaluation of guest room layout and hardware (whether the room is big or not): The hardware decoration is almost impeccable. The only flaw is that the hot and cold water signs on the bathroom faucet are installed backwards. Everything else is fine;
3. Minibar and bathroom supplies: During my stay, it was time to "go back to the south", so the bath towels, hand towels, and square towels in a few rooms and the sweat towels connected to the gym had a strange smell. After I raised my opinion, a new one was replaced. The batch is completely boring, and the processing speed is timely and efficient; 4. Room view (good view): From the window, you can see Shenzhen University, an excellent representative of the beautiful scenery among Chinese universities. Although it is not 985, Shenzhen University still ranks among the top 100 Chinese universities all year round due to its excellent location advantages and rapid progress. Its strength cannot be underestimated. You can make a free reservation to visit through the WeChat applet. There is a statue of Rabindranath Tagore, my youngest son’s favorite poet.

☕️ Dining

1. Food types and services in the executive lounge (like or dislike): InterContinental’s 666th hotel in Greater China is Kimpton Qiantan. Although Shenzhen Railway CP is not that new, it is a newcomer to the industry that is just four years old. , both hardware and software adopt IHG's extremely high and latest standards. Therefore, the "quality" of the executive lounge is excellent, and the hot food during happy hour is also rich enough, so there is no need to spend money separately for dinner;
2. Hotel breakfast types and services (good or bad): There are many Japanese guests at breakfast because there are many Japanese companies around. Glutinous rice chicken is the eldest son's favorite; 3. Hotel restaurant hardware, taste and service: There is a 711 downstairs in the hotel, and a KFC on the opposite side of the underground passage. In addition, it is not too far to take a taxi to the two stores in Yuemanlou.

🏊 Hardware Facilities

1. Hotel environment: The lobby is on a high floor, ensuring the privacy of the hotel; the entrance on the first floor is separated from the office area of ​​the Metro Financial Building, so there is no need to worry about disorder;
2. Gym and swimming pool (new): The high-rise infinity swimming pool is particularly suitable for taking photos and checking in. The only drawback is the male lifeguard in the afternoon. His attitude is arrogant. If I were the boss, I would have fired him 10,000 times, haha; in comparison, In other words, during the morning exercise, the two girls on duty at the gym came to work early and scrubbed the equipment. They could definitely be rated as "March 8th Red Flag Bearers". As expected, there is no harm if there is no comparison. ;
3. Children’s entertainment: Take a taxi to Happy Harbor (now Shenzhen’s MPV online ride-hailing companies mostly use Lantu. Compared with GL8 and Roewe IMAX8, the comfort level has been significantly improved). It only takes 9 kilometers. The Ferris wheel and Zhongshuge are must-sees. , it was at Zhongshuge that I bought the electronic military chess set that my sons couldn’t put down;
4. Business Center: Because I am an InterContinental Diamond member, I can print out my children’s learning materials in the lounge for free, which is a big help to my two sons.

🌟 The Moments

1. Highlights (advantages and disadvantages): It only takes a quarter of an hour to visit Nantou Ancient Town by bicycle. Living in Shenzhen Railway CP is a strategically located choice whether you are traveling, studying or on a business trip;
2. Outstanding performance and awards for star employees (whether the service is strong or not): Jeans and many other managers and employees took great care of their two sons and specially gave them plush toys, etc. Thank you very much.

📍 Brief summary Conclusion

1. Highlights of the trip: It is still a bit far to go to Zhongying Street, so it is recommended to plan the time in advance. In addition, you need to make an online reservation in advance for Zhongying Street. In addition, after you go there, the interval between reservations again is different between Cantonese and non-locals, so you should be aware of this;
2. Surrounding food, attractions, and entertainment: If you are tired of playing in Guangzhou Chimelong, you can go to Zhuhai Chimelong. You can choose high-speed rail or cruise to go to Zhuhai. For related matters, you can consult the hotel front desk.

When I came to Shenzhen, there was no harm without comparison. This Crowne Plaza Hotel is really worthy of praise, and the service is great. OK, the day before check-in, I called to confirm, asked about my needs, and then asked me to contact the hotel housekeeper via WeChat if necessary. The arranged room fully met my needs. The hotel has a very beautiful view. I can see Shenzhen Bay and walk to the CBD of Nanshan District. You can get there in 15 minutes! Breakfast is also delicious! The hotel is very new and clean.

Aurora maintained friendly communication throughout the whole process and chose a room with a good view for us.

By the way, I would like to praise the floor-to-ceiling windows in the house. The night view is great! The location is easy to find. It is next to the business district. It is very convenient to go downstairs for shopping and eating! I am very satisfied with my stay and the transportation is convenient. The small furnishings in the room are also very unique in design, and the service provided by the team Aurora Xiaolin is also very enthusiastic. It is a very pleasant stay experience! 🙃

The scenery is beautiful. The breakfast is very rich. Although the executive lounge is small, the basic food is also available. The most praiseworthy choice is the swimming pool on the 48th floor. It is super beautiful. Special thanks to the lifeguard from Maoming. When he was free and there were no other swimmers present, he carefully taught my daughter how to swim correctly. Thank you very much. Just because of his enthusiasm, I will stay at this hotel again!

I think it is safer this way. Although it is more inconvenient to change elevators, it can be ignored automatically if it is safe. . The hotel service is very good and there are many interns with good service attitude. Thanks to Aurora and Emily from the team for their warm service. We feel very comfortable staying here without worrying about safety issues. The hotel's hygiene standards are also very satisfactory, with every corner kept neat and clean. There are no cluttered items in the room, everything is in order.

Arrived at 2 o'clock. There was a room available, so I checked in directly.
The room is very new and has a simple design. The bathroom brand is GROHE. I like the brand very much. The water output is large and the bath is very comfortable.
The shampoo and conditioner is from Borghese, an old brand. It feels good to use.
The service is very good. The man named He at the front desk checked in quickly. There are two young men at the concierge. The service is proactive, attentive and has a good attitude.
Compared with hotels of the same level in the free shipping area, the breakfast variety is much more, and it has not shrunk at all due to the decrease in passenger flow during the New Year.
I will stay at this hotel next time I come back!

msg:Intercontinental + Shenzhen Railway is a very reliable combination. It also reflects the miserable current situation in the real estate industry that only state-owned enterprises can manage self-owned properties. The hotel is located on top of the TOD subway, and the transportation is very convenient. You can transfer to the subway directly on the first floor. InterContinental's operations are still very stable, from the speed of the front desk process to the response speed of the guest rooms. The breakfast is at the normal level for intercontinental countries, with a full range of dishes and popular tastes. Children are used to it, which is quite good.
The design of the hotel is good, the style is very new, the tone is simple and elegant, and the materials used are all glass and aluminum panels in a modern style, which should be very in line with the aesthetics of the post-85 generation.
The only complaint I have about the bathroom products is that they are of a brand name, but they are placed in containers fixed on the wall and look very cheap. I suggest you put them outside alone, which is more in line with the overall quality of the hotel.

The sky lobby on the 46th floor has a high area view, the rooftop swimming pool on the 48th floor, and the baby-walking facilities in a non-family hotel are not regrettable at all. I hope the hotel can improve. The shortcomings are mainly breakfast. First, the food is not good, it is average 4-star level, the noodles are not cooked well, the beverage area was empty very early for two days in a row and there was no one to replenish it, the tableware is scattered and weird, and quilts, spoons and bowls are often missing. , the dinner plates only have small plates, and it’s exhausting to go back and forth. What needs to be improved most is the level of the service staff. During breakfast, they chat with parents on their mobile phones, and I feel that the training is not adequate.

I contacted Xiao Yang from the customer team and she immediately helped me coordinate the room. Because it takes time to clean the room, after arriving at the store, I asked Emily at the front desk to help me go through the formalities and then store my luggage at the front desk. Overall, it's pretty good. The feedback issues have been reasonably resolved and won't affect my next visit.

He immediately sincerely said happy birthday to his friend. Since it was already past 10 pm, he said that a cake would be served at noon the next day.
Enjoy a welcome drink in the lobby on the 46th floor. Although the night view is not very busy, it is still very pleasant.
The breakfast food is quite rich, and my favorites include freshly cooked casserole porridge, noodle wontons and fried egg omelets, etc. In addition, the restaurant has been decorated with various New Year decorations, making it even more a**ospheric.
The indoor swimming pool on the 48th floor is one of my favorites. You can swim while watching the scenery, and there is also a heated massage pool. Since it is a weekday, we can check in and enjoy the tour, which is really a great enjoyment!
The room is overall clean and hygienic, in line with the standards of a five-star hotel😄

The breakfast is also very rich, with many choices, and there are also some non-Shenzhen/Guangdong local foods. The manager of the guest room center also came to apologize with a very sincere attitude. He indeed felt responsible for the accident.
In fact, as an old flagship hotel of Intercontinental and a new hotel, the facilities are nothing to say. In addition, treating every guest with care will greatly improve the entire stay experience.

msg:[Facilities] Very average, the home and bathroom decoration brands are not as good as the Fairfield Business Hotel under Marriott. For rooms facing Shennan Avenue, there is still the noise of cars speeding on the road on the 41st floor. There was a smell in the room. If I wanted to breathe some air, I could only call the service to open the window. Bathing and hand washing supplies are in large bottles for environmental protection. Toiletries such as toothbrushes are average even in the supreme view room.
[Hygiene] The guest room area has a damp smell, no fragrance at all, as if it has not been cleaned and sanitized. The carpets in the corridors and rooms seem to have not been sanitized. It smells bad, and the hotel has directly dropped its price to the level of a small hotel.
[Environment] There are several lobbies in the hotel, including the subway entrance lobby on the first floor and the taxi lobby on the third floor. Only the check-in lobby on the 46th floor has a little fragrance. The carpets in the elevator and other floors smell very bad, and there is also a damp smell in the room. . At the time of check-in, other guests asked to change rooms because of the smell. To my surprise, I also asked to change rooms. As soon as I entered the door, there was a smell of dampness and I couldn't stay. I waited at the door for 20 minutes before the waiter came over with the room card. If it hadn't been for me, I have a meeting in the afternoon and they don’t know when they can deliver it. They said that the 6 people in the concierge depar**ent were too busy, so if I went to the front desk to change it, it might have been done long ago.
[Service] If two people stay, they will get a drink coupon, which was useless in the end. I ordered a pot of tea at the lobby restaurant bar for 218 yuan. Even if I say that guests don’t get discounts, the 100 yuan afternoon tea voucher that comes with the check-in package is just a piece of white paper. You can get the same discount without using a voucher.
If you confirm it's your birthday when checking in, you can send a cake and leave it in the room refrigerator between 7:30-8:00 pm. We didn't see the cake when we came back from dinner. We were rushed from 8 o'clock to 10 o'clock before it was delivered. Ordinary candles and lighters were not used when it was delivered. I called customer service and asked the restaurant to deliver it immediately. I contacted customer service on WeChat and said that the birthday cake did not come with candles and lighters. (No point borrowing it), I don’t know what kind of perfunctory way and attitude your service staff use to serve customers. I spent almost 3,000 yuan for 2 nights and didn't even bother with a cake. If you had told me earlier that you would not provide birthday cakes with candles, we would have bought them from outside and just wanted to have a happy birthday.
I have stayed at Pullman in Shenzhen and the service was not good. This time I stayed at Crown under the same group and the service and rooms were abysmal. I will never stay there again. There will be no next time.

I flew a few hours from home to check in. I chose a hotel closer to the school campus. Hotel, the hotel was chosen after comparing many hotels nearby. The first location of the hotel is very good. There is a shopping mall of Vientiane World nearby, which is very convenient for eating and shopping. It is only one stop away by subway, and there are subway exits on the third and first floor of the subway. We stayed there for a few days. It is more common to take the subway directly. When you come back, you can take a walk and walk back to the hotel. You can also go to the campus to check out the school area. The hotel's floor is quite high. I have a loyal customer team manager Lynn to help me during my stay. I upgraded the room to a high floor and the view is very good. When I learned that I was going to university, I was specifically asked if I should arrange for a view on the west side. This room also has a view of the campus when it comes to sunset. The sunset is very beautiful. My parents also liked it. I really like it. The exterior of the hotel lobby is also very beautiful. It has a sky lobby design and you can see Futian from the exterior. You can also see the Window of the World, as well as the Ping An Building in Futian. It feels like you got to know Shenzhen for the first time, and then you come back to the front desk on the 46th floor to continue your stay. When the staff member Monica extended my stay, she took the initiative to ask about my stay experience, which made me feel very considerate. In order to learn more about Shenzhen’s local charm, I also made some strategies. She also recommended some places to me. If I don’t understand something, I just ask the service staff and they will be very enthusiastic to explain it to me. The hotel's swimming pool is really recommended. The lady here is also very nice. The swimming pool is quite big, 25M long. There is also a check-in spot "I❤️SZ" which is very nice to take pictures. I specially chose the afternoon time to swim there and you can also watch the sunset and the beautiful scenery is unparalleled. 🌄🌄🌄The breakfast and buffet are also delicious, 🍝🫕🍲🍜🥘🌮🥗🥙🍔🌭🥪🫔🍗🍖🧆🥟🍤🦪🥠🥮🍣🍛🍛🍥
It's very rich. My family and I are very satisfied with the breakfast meals here. There is also Cantonese rice roll. It is our first time to eat this food, but we like it surprisingly. Forgive me for not having seen the world 😅😅😅😅. We like the Cantonese cuisine very much, and the Chinese restaurant on the 47th floor is very good. Cantonese food is very good, and there is also an afternoon tea set with a good value for money. Cantonese afternoon tea. Worth a try. The equipment in the room is good, but the hair dryer is a bit outdated. It freezes when you blow it. I don’t know who the designer is. The design of the curtain control panel of the switch is really difficult to describe. I searched and found that it is a well-known design company in Shenzhen. However, this design did not consider this practicality. The switch operation is too difficult. There is also the control of lights. For example, if you want to turn on the light at that position, you must turn off the main switch and turn it on again. I'm really tired of this. Another small detail is that after finishing my meal, I was in the public restroom on the 46th floor. I found that no matter how carefully I turned on the faucet🚰 or washed my hands lightly, water stains would spray out. The higher the tap, the more violent it would be. . In the end, I found out that the position of the pool was not right, so the aunt who had to clean it hard did not do it on purpose.
Facilities: Very good 👍
Hygiene: very good👍👍👍
Environment: Very good👍👍👍
Service: Superb! The waiters in the Western restaurant on the 46th floor could be improved a bit, they are aloof. People in other depar**ents are very enthusiastic

msg:The hotel location is 5 stars, the rooms are 5 stars, and the facilities are 5 stars. The heated swimming pool is on the top floor. On my birthday, the hotel thoughtfully gave me a small amount of food and birthday cake. Great. The hotel lobby is on the 46th floor. You have to go to another one every time you come in and out. It's a bit inconvenient to stay in Lift. There are many people at breakfast and you have to queue up to be seated. Food replenishment is slow, but there are many choices and the taste is good. I will definitely stay here again next time I have the opportunity.

The design of this hotel is really avant-garde and innovative. When I walked into the lobby, I was shocked by the stunning decoration! Every corner is full of fashion, making it a paradise for photography lovers! Moreover, the design of the guest rooms is also amazing and very modern, making me feel like I am in the future world.

Not only the design, the service of this hotel is also top-notch! Special praise goes to Wendy and Monica from the loyal customer team, their service is beyond words!

However, what I like most is the service of the hotel team. Especially Wendy and Monica from the loyal customer team. They always welcome me with a smile and warm attitude and provide me with personalized service.

Wendy and Monica understand my needs and preferences very well and always provide me with the best service. Their expertise and enthusiasm made me feel very comfortable and satisfied during my stay at the hotel.

Not only did they provide me with comfortable accommodation, but they also provided me with a lot of suggestions on local food and travel, allowing me to better understand the local culture and customs.

Overall, I really like the Shenzhen Crowne Plaza. The hotel environment is very good and the service is also very good. Especially the service provided by Wendy and Monica made me feel the enthusiasm and attentiveness of the hotel team. I look forward to staying at the Crowne Plaza Shenzhen Railway Hotel again and enjoying the excellent service from Wendy, Monica and the hotel team!

msg:The hotel's breakfast is a hard-core mess. The beef offal with coffee is fresh and strong. The traditional rice rolls with vegetables, meat and eggs are classic and delicious. They are smooth and fresh with a little soy sauce. On the last day of the Shenzhen holiday, I always wanted to see something different, so I once again asked Miss Rebecca to patiently answer all my questions. I was sure that the OCT Entrepreneurship Park could be reached by taxi in about ten minutes, so I set off quickly. As expected of Greater Shenzhen, all the stores in the Pioneer Park are aesthetically pleasing. I especially spent more than three hours at the Old Paradise Bookstore. The treasured books, records, and all kinds of fun groceries are really my thing. I will definitely come back next time. Stay at the Shenzhen Railway Crown and continue your in-depth tour of Shenzhen👻

And they have a loyal customer team member named Aurora.

When I came to Shenzhen for a business trip, I deliberately chose the Crown Hotel, which has convenient transportation~

The staff are enthusiastic, patient and meticulous; the room is clean and tidy. I think Vina and Amanda are super nice. They also help arrange luggage and explain the features of each functional area of ​​the hotel. I am also very lucky to be upgraded to a room with a view😍

A must-choice hotel for business trips, I will visit again next time😘

msg:This is the second time I have stayed at the Shenzhen Crowne Plaza. This time I clearly felt the hotel's care.
Before check-in, Wendy from the loyal customer team called in advance to confirm the arrival time and arranged to upgrade to a view room on the 42nd floor, which also had a view of the spring bamboo shoots (China Resources Building) facing Shenzhen Bay. I was very satisfied! The floor-to-ceiling windows are very wide, and I would call them the best orientation. The view is perfect both during the day and at night!
The hotel is located at the Shenzhen University Metro Station, with very convenient transportation. You can also see the Guangdong Campus of Shenzhen University through the floor-to-ceiling windows of the hotel. As a hotel opened in 2020, all aspects of the configuration are very new, whether it is the bathtub in the room or the facilities in the public area, the bedding is also very comfortable, and the breakfast, I think, is currently in the first echelon of Crowne Plaza.
Service part: During my stay, Wendy from the loyal customer team has also been following up on any questions I had, and the service is very good. There is nothing to say about the breakfast view, and the food is also very good.
Summary: The view and location are perfect, and the service is even better! Next time I come to Shenzhen, I will still choose Shenzhen Railway Crowne Plaza~

msg:Overall, this hotel is very good. It is the best of the many Crowne Plaza hotels I have stayed in Shenzhen. I am a fan of hotel check-in. Every day if I have nothing to do, I will explore some new hotels. I am very interested in the hotel facilities and catering. Even if I don’t stay in the hotel, I will go to experience the hotel’s meals and services. This hotel is A colleague of mine recommended it by accident. I usually live in other brands, but this time I also wanted to step on the thunder, to see if there are any different expectations. I drove to the righ**ost side of Shennan Avenue and took the auxiliary road to the third. You can put your car in the parking lot on the second floor on the platform of the second floor. The ground area on the third floor is not very spacious and you can’t park a lot of cars. I guess the hotel won’t let you park on the ground all the time. I booked a room on Ctrip. There is a depar**ent in the hotel called Zhongchen The customer team contacted us and asked about my estimated arrival time. This service is okay and deserves praise. I asked them several times to help me with some trivial matters with Lynn monica wendy in their depar**ent, because every time they would ask who you are, They will introduce themselves and get to know them for the first time. When they get off at the hotel parking lot and find the elevator, they go straight up to the 46th floor to check in. There is no doubt that it must be the design of the sky lobby. During the stay, you have to go to the concierge on the third floor to pick it up. , Passing by the third floor, you will see the guests think that the concierge counter is the check-in counter, and it really looks a bit like it. I think we can put up a sign - check in on the 46th floor, so everyone can understand it when they see it, right? . This is just a suggestion. After I arrived on the 46th floor, Dexter handled the procedures for me. He has strong professional skills and the operation is very simple. He finished it for me in three or two clicks. He also told me about some hotel facilities and equipment. I finished it. The house next door is still in progress, which is remarkable. The guest rooms of the hotel are independent and have to be transferred to the elevator. This design is quite good for guests traveling alone, so as to isolate some outsiders so as not to be disturbed. I'm a fitness enthusiast, so I went to visit their gym on the 48th floor after putting down my luggage I live in Kempinski, which is about the same location nearby. Fortunately, the swimming pool is very good. It is a large heated swimming pool. I directly abandoned their gym and went swimming. The restaurant tastes very delicious for dinner, because the main food is Cantonese cuisine. It would be meaningless if the Cantonese cuisine deviates from the original taste of the ingredients. I personally eat a list and pursue the original taste of the food. The Chinese food in this hotel is still worthy of praise , The landscape of this hotel is comparable to that of Shenzhen Bay Renaissance and other hotels. Although there is no full view of the bay, he can see the landscape in the east of Shenzhen and the sunset in the west. It is really beautiful and comfortable to lie on the sofa by the window to watch the sunset, or enjoy the evening scenery by the infinity swimming pool. There are also shopping malls where you can go shopping. I asked the customer service amanda which way is the closest. The hotel staff suggested that I take a subway station and get there in one stop. It would be troublesome to drive and park. Think about it, so I just took the elevator and went down to the next floor. It’s the subway, I prefer to try it, I think it’s really convenient to take the subway, it’s fast and you don’t have to wait for traffic lights. Finally, after shopping around, I came back to wash up. I think it’s okay to experience the breakfast the next day. The supervisor of the western restaurant is very polite.
Very good, I was served a cup of black tea after I was seated, and most of the food was similar to other hotels, nothing special, and finally checked out and called a concierge Cody to help me with some luggage storage to end the first experience of this hotel, The whole hotel is very good and the service is in place, but this hotel has too few gym training equipment in your hotel to meet the daily fitness training needs. It is also quite different from Crowne Plaza hotels in other cities. Other aspects are great, thank you !

Very suitable for the festival, the lanterns are very cute, and they are also rabbit lanterns. The hotel staff Aurora was also very nice. Checked me in. The hotel has a very good view. It is located in Nanshan District, Shenzhen. The main reason is that there are not too many tall buildings around to block the view, which highlights the hotel's very wide exterior. I booked a room with a 270℃ view. The room type is also unique. The hotel's swimming pool is very good. pretty. Stayed a few more days

The environment, lobby and rooms are better than expected. None of the netizens who helped check in were so polite and said it was just a normal reception. At the same time, I forgot to give a $100 afternoon tea coupon. However, this trip is an anniversary and I am grateful for the extension. Cancellation until 2 p.m. Room ☺️ In addition, after swimming on another day, I found that I could not return to the room. This also needs to be paid attention to because a five-star hotel should not make such mistakes.

The room was hygienic. I felt like something was biting me after I put on the quilt at night. My feet and arms were very itchy, but it didn't look like mosquitoes either🥹🥹

The swimming pool environment is ideal and there are not too many people. It is a good experience. However, there is no one to greet you in the locker room, which is relatively inferior to a five-star hotel.

I purchased an additional breakfast. There are many kinds of breakfast food. The taste is average, but it is 10 points excellent, but it is worth purchasing because you can see the beautiful scenery.

msg:What impresses me most about this hotel is the hotel's service. From the concierge depar**ent, there are waiters who help pick up the luggage and send it to the 46th floor for check-in. This time I have a lot of luggage, so I am very satisfied with the service here. Monica, the waiter in the lobby on the first floor, guided the check-in, and the movements were fluent. Because of some minor problems, Lynn helped upgrade the room. Thank you very much. After dinner in the evening, I wanted to go to the gym to exercise. Aurora in the lobby guided me to the 48F gym and helped introduce the gym The facilities and equipment in the gym are also very good, and it is enough motivation to exercise and see such a beautiful view. When checking out, Wendy carefully asked if you need to store your luggage. The service is attentive. The check-in experience is good, and the breakfast buffet is also good. Very rich, the loyal customer team also specially added my WeChat to return my check-in experience, very considerate and thoughtful, thank them, and will choose again next time I come

msg:The location of the hotel is superior, the transportation is convenient, and shopping is also very convenient. The subway station of Line 1 is just outside the door, only one stop away from Vientiane World, and there are many delicious foods nearby. Window of the World and Overseas Chinese Town are also very close
The environment inside and outside the hotel is great, and the service is also great. Among them, Esme, a beautiful woman at the front desk, was very enthusiastic. She helped me upgrade the room and adjusted the orientation. I can watch the sunrise and the beautiful sea view in the morning and evening. She also gave me an afternoon tea drink coupon in the lobby. Thank you very much.
The other front desk clerks are also very good, patient, polite, and have the basic qualities of a high-end hotel. Say hello when you are far away, and take the initiative to lead the way. The room is very comfortable and well-equipped. The bathroom products are from the Italian Borghese brand, which are easy to use. The cleaning is also timely and thorough. The waiter found that we drank all the water on the first day, so he gave four more bottles of water.
The breakfast is very rich, exceeding the types of most five-star hotels. I am very happy to eat cheese and freshly baked pineapple buns. of.
Involuntarily, I turned down hotels in other places and stayed for another day.
All in all, it's great, and Mr. and I decided to stay here again next time!

msg:The room has an unpleasant smell and makes it hard to sleep. The price is unreasonable and a scam. I paid a deposit of 500 yuan when I checked in, and deducted the breakfast fee of 98 yuan. Normally, I should have refunded 402 yuan, but now I only refund 280 yuan. Please contact the hotel front desk by phone. I was told that I took a few bottles of drinks from the refrigerator and they were directly deducted. The drinks are really expensive. I was not informed of the drinks in the refrigerator when I checked in. The key problem is that the price is unreasonable. How much is Coke and Sprite worth? This stay is really great It's terrible, I didn't sleep well, and I charged an exorbitant amount of money.

I tried to live in a double room and had a great experience. The lobby is very impressive at the height of the 46th floor. The breakfast here is also delicious. There is also an infinity pool and a gym on the top floor. There are floor-to-ceiling windows almost everywhere. The view is so good, and you can see Shenzhen Bay~ Lucas, the manager on duty, also provides great service. Overall, the price is very good. I recommend it to Shenzhen

msg:The hotel is next to Shenzhen University Station, very convenient. There are construction sites around, but the hotel has good sound insulation, so I'm not worried. (I checked in later, as I expected) Also, another stop is mixc city, which is why I picked this hotel.
Entering the lobby, I found that the reception is on the 46th floor, knowing that the middle does not belong to the hotel. , we are on the 34th floor, and we have to transfer to the elevator, which is inconvenient.
        The room is not too big, as the information says, about 40 square meters. The strangest thing is two single beds, each 1.2 meters. Generally, the standard is 1.35 meters. What exactly is the policy? What's more, there is no surround on the floor of the bathtub, children playing with water will wet the corridor, and the bathtub is also not waterproof, and the water makes the towels on the outside floor completely wet. Is this a design error?
        Surprisingly, the sky pool, as advertised, is where Gang Hong checked in, and there were three selfies that day (really distracting).
        The breakfast is reasonable and luxurious, and the room matches the 5-star rating.

msg:Checking in this hotel is generally okay. It’s the first time I checked in. The hardware is okay and the service is okay. On the first day of check-in, Lynn at the front desk received me. He shared with me the hotel’s facilities and the benefits of my order, and the room was upgraded. After a while, I finally finished the formalities and told her that I can find her if I need assistance. I didn't add them on WeChat because of personal reasons, and there are no special requirements for going out and staying in a hotel. The room I arranged was very good. This time I chose the east side, because I didn’t want to get too hot in the afternoon. I ordered takeaway and had to go downstairs to the third floor to pick it up because there were a lot of things. Cody, the handsome guy at the concierge, kindly helped me take them together Go up, the hotel's swimming pool is very good👍👍👍, I heard that their hotel swimming pool is very good, and it turned out to be really good. After swimming for a long time, I went to the lobby bar to have some drinks, because there was a drink coupon, so I met The staff in the lobby bar are also very caring. I talked to me about her coming for an internship, and Kiki Liu who stayed last left a deep impression on me. The hotel's mooncakes are displayed in the lobby several times and I want to ask if I can try them. I am afraid that opening the blind box will waste it if it is not delicious. If it is delicious, I can take a few boxes to give away. Some hotels offer food samples directly, which I think is quite good. In the end, Dexter refunded me very politely when I checked out. Allen, the concierge, helped me carry my luggage downstairs until my car arrived and also helped me get it to the car. The first impression of this hotel is that the whole check-in experience service is very good 👍👍, Worth coming back to stay again

msg:I heard that Crowne Plaza Shentie is the flagship store of Crown. I have heard about it for a long time, so I went here because of its reputation. I made a reservation for 1 day at that time. I was conquered by him. The hotel is located in the Nanshan area of ​​Shenzhen. I drove from Futian and arrived there soon. When I got to the hotel, it would be a bit detoured. There are also construction sites around. My first thought was not to make too much noise. When I arrived at the hotel After parking the car in the parking lot, take the elevator directly to the 46th floor. I made a strategy to avoid finding the door. The third floor is the concierge lobby and the first floor is the lobby of the office building. I went directly to the 46th floor and came out to see the exterior scene. My first impression was not good. Yes, you can see Futian District and Window of the World, and there is nothing blocking it, except that there is a nearby SF Building next door? If it weren’t for this building, the view would be really great. Lynn checked me in. I’m an order from Ctrip. I also recommend adding their WeChat on duty to take care of my check-in experience. Their team and Monica helped me deal with the continuation I also introduced the hotel's facilities and equipment and some internet celebrity check-in points. I will check them later. The best thing is the swimming pool. There was this thing on the Hanjing Building before, but unfortunately it was removed. For me I think the controversial topic of people who have several houses in Shenzhen "SZ" is very meaningful. During the stay, the concierge helped me deliver some mailed items. I think their service is very good. Cody and Edmond often saw them brush my license plate for me on the 3rd floor, and once it was Sunny in the lounge. , The service in the lounge is also very good, and I have chatted with them. The swimming pool is on the 48th floor and you need to register. I just don’t have a person who has to ask me to show the room card. I don’t understand. You can check the registration information with me, or contact the front desk to check. The main reason is that the room card is not with you. The back of the body also contacted my companion to pick me up. The environment of the swimming pool is very good, which can make you forget the dissatisfaction just now. The beautiful scenery always makes people happy physically and mentally. The last follow-up was handled by Jade for me, and she was very polite. I wanted to talk to her about this matter and I will do it later Well, finally Dexter checked out for me. I think the service at the front desk is very good, as long as it is on the 46th floor and the 3rd floor, it is very good, so although I have to go back to the 46th floor to take the elevator, I am willing to walk a few more steps. Sometimes I will consciously go down to the third floor to brush the license plate while watching the queue. The overall experience is still very good. It is worth bringing my family and friends to this hotel again in the future. It is much better than the one in Futian. Like it 👍

msg:[Shentie Crowne Plaza] Can be one, more can be repeated

[Purpose] Three days and two nights, self-driving in summer, family travel, elderly

[Check-in] Two nights in a double bed (including breakfast) + double bed room, of which the double bed room will be upgraded to an "L-shaped" superior viewing double bed room after arriving at the store, overlooking the southwest and northwest directions.

[Experience] Staying at Shenzhen Railway Crowne Plaza for the third time, each time has a different feeling.

For the first time, I led a team to Shenzhen University for exchange 2 years ago. The hotel next to the university has a convenient location. It was the first time I boarded the lobby on the 46th floor. Through the full floor-to-ceiling glass, I looked around the Nanshan Mountains in Shenzhen in the four directions of the southeast, northwest, and the Lau Fau Mountain in Yuen Long on the other side of the Shenzhen Bay. It was very shocking. The rooms are not particularly large, but comfortable and elegant. Each room has a transparent floor-to-ceiling window overlooking the buildings along Shennan Avenue, giving you the feeling of "king of the world". But because I had a mission at the time, I spent most of my time outside and rarely stayed in the hotel, so I didn't have a deep sense of experience.

The second time, also in the late autumn 2 years ago, I traveled by car with my wife and arranged to stay in Shenzhen for one night as the last stop before returning to Guangzhou. I booked InterContinental Dameisha, but was let go, so I decided to go back to Crowne Plaza Shenzhen Railway. It was already 10 o'clock in the evening when I arrived at the store, and the front desk paid for check-in. I didn't have much experience in a hurry, and the main thing was peace of mind. However, there was a small episode, that is, after leaving the store, I found that I booked the same room through Ctrip, and breakfast was included at the same price. I called the hotel on the way back, and got a reply that "the next time I enter the store, I will get two additional breakfasts", which also left a foreshadowing for the third stay.

The third time, I stayed again a few days ago, focusing on peace of mind and familiarity. Traveling with my 70-year-old parents, I didn't dare to try too many new things, so I booked back to Shenzhen Railway Crowne Plaza. There are several aspects to consider:

1. Price. Many hotels will increase their prices during the summer, but the price here is actually the same as the last two stays, which is in line with psychological expectations.
2. Environment. With a height above the 36th floor and super-large floor-to-ceiling glass, staying in the hotel is basically equivalent to climbing the tower. The family can enjoy the scenery at any time from check-in to breakfast every day and returning to the room to sleep, extra points! The hotel facilities are well maintained, not too old, clean, natural and comfortable.
3. Facilities. Considering the high temperature and hot weather before traveling, you can swim in the hotel if you don’t want to go out. The indoor swimming pool on the 48th floor here is 25 meters long.
4. Traffic. Since I drive by myself every time I come, the indoor parking lot is on the 2nd floor, and the ventilation and ventilation will not smell bad, which is a plus for me personally. But this time I also found out that the "Shenzhen University Station" of Metro Line 1 is on the "minus one" floor, and the hotel elevator goes straight down to fry chicken, which is convenient. On the night of check-in, the Window of the World is just three stops away by subway, and you are not afraid of traffic restrictions or typhoons from other places. Shenzhen's most popular Vientiane World is just 2 kilometers away, and it takes only 10 minutes to drive there. The location is very good.
5. Catering. I only ate the buffet for breakfast and lunch, and there was no big surprise, so there is no need to come here for the buffet. There is also a Chinese restaurant in the hotel, but I haven't tried it. There is a yakiniku restaurant on the platform on the 3rd floor, and you can go to the cafeteria late at night, but every time I am hungry, I order takeaway directly, and it is very convenient to pick up the food at the express cabinet downstairs.
6. Service. The hotel front desk, restaurant waiters and room attendants were all very polite and amiable, of course I only judge what I encountered. The aunt in the room gave me a few more bottles of water every day, and changed the towels very diligently. Monica Lynn's service is very good.
7. Surprise. As mentioned before, I will be given two additional breakfasts, but I am not sure that the other party still remembers it when I made the reservation this time. As a result, the hotel sales said that everything promised to the guests would be recorded, and not only did they provide two additional breakfasts, but also upgraded the room type for free, so that I only need to book the cheapest room type, which is very considerate. When I checked in, I found out that I stayed in the hotel for two nights and even served breakfast for two days, which was a pleasant surprise. Of course, if they only delivered breakfast one day, I would also give them full marks for keeping their word. I think a five-star hotel should have the service attitude and tolerance. In addition, I don’t know if I heard it wrong. When I had breakfast on the third day, I vaguely heard the restaurant manager call my surname "Mr. XX". If it is true, I think this kind of service is worth my next visit.

To sum up, although Crowne Plaza is not a particularly high-end series in the Marriott Group, I will basically not go to several Crowne Plazas in Guangzhou because they are relatively old. But the deep iron hotel gave me a really good feeling, comfortable and safe, and the price is also within a reasonable range.

msg:Shenzhen Railway Crown is a brand under InterContinental. The hardware and software of the hotel are relatively trustworthy. As a frequent visitor to various brand hotels, this hotel is quite good in all aspects among the five Crowne Plazas in Shenzhen. Yes, far ahead. First of all, the location is very unique, located near the Nanshan Regional Science and Technology Park in Shenzhen. There is a subway entrance on the first floor of the hotel. As soon as you come out of Exit D, you will see the hotel building. Take the elevator to the 46th floor to check in. If you are driving, choose Shennan Avenue. When you are approaching, drive slowly and drive to the 2nd floor of the hotel for parking After parking the car, go directly to the 46th floor to check in. Secondly, the room security is very good. The hotel chose the design concept of the sky lobby. It should be out of safety management considerations. The hotel rooms have 4 separate elevators. If there is no room card for outsiders, there is no way to go to the room. room. Especially for me, a person who travels frequently, safety must be the first. This design gives full marks and is full of security. The takeaways are all placed in the takeaway cabinet next to the concierge lobby on the third floor, and you need to go to the concierge depar**ent on the third floor to pick them up. Take a short walk before eating. On the first day when I came to the hotel, I was fascinated by the view on the 46th floor. It happened that the weather was fine, so the sky was extremely blue. I felt like a beautiful painting, and the camera could not reproduce the beauty of nature. The room is arranged in the west-facing room. The view of the room is really beautiful. It is different from the view over the lobby. The view of the room can enjoy the sunset. It happens that you don’t get up very early in the morning. You can sit on the sofa in the evening and enjoy the sunset in Shenzhen , No matter from which angle, I found that the landscape is beautiful. I really recommend the swimming pool. It is on the 48th floor, the highest floor of the hotel. The operating hours are from 06:30 to 23:00. I am very happy when I hear this time. The time is really late, and other hotels close early. , stayed in the hotel for several days, I think the service here is really good, the staff Lynn Zoe Monica, Dexter, Jason, Lucas, Eric, Jade, Amanda, Sunny, Edmon, Eva, Cody, Esma, Felix, Nicole , Jelly, Rebacca, Vina, thank them for their service and make me feel very warm. Although there is not much language communication, their performance gives me the feeling that the service is really good and worthy of praise. I hope that I can continue to meet them when I have the opportunity to come to Shenzhen again for business trips, and I will choose this hotel again. Good luck with your work. I hope the hotel will get better and better and the business is booming

After staying in Hong Kong for three nights, I had to refund one night. Ctrip had to coordinate with the hotel manager several times but was rejected. In Shenzhen, I temporarily changed my itinerary and left the hotel one day earlier. The hotel decisively agreed to refund for one night.

- It was extremely hot at night, and I was told that there was only heating and no cooling function in the hot weather? ? Have you not considered the feelings of customers who are afraid of heat? When I asked the front desk, I was told that I could only turn off the air conditioner, but it was still very hot and stuffy. When I asked the waiter, he said I could only open the window. It is recommended that people who are afraid of heat not come.
-Arrived for breakfast at 9:50 and found that most of the dishes were gone. As a star hotel, meals are collected at 10 o'clock. Are you just so frugal? Have you not considered what the guests who come at 9:50 will eat? Secondly, the attitude of the breakfast service staff is also very average. They will never make extra food for customers when the time comes, and they are really on time when they get off work.

From waiting for the luggage to changing the room, it took more than an hour to disturb the children before they could take a bath and settle down... It was not until the next day It’s a classic. I bought a parent-child package on Saturday. (Ctrip’s writing is very attractive. If you’re interested, look at the pictures). There is a parent-child activity on Saturday afternoon. I called the front desk at 11 am to ask where it will be held. Later, I waited online. In 10 minutes, she said no... I said no... It was already expected when I checked in... Then another caller said: "I didn't have it, and now we are doing it for us. This is very interesting... The package you sell is written in white In black... now for us? ! I really hehe! Finally, of course, when it comes to parent-child activities...It is completely different from what is written on Ctrip...Fortunately, the children like it...Oh...Forget it...

Finally, I want to say that this hotel is managed by InterContinental. The good depar**ents are really good, but the bad depar**ents are too bad... So if you are taking the elderly or children out to play, really think about it... But if you are Business trips, no problem!

msg:I booked a parent-child room in advance. When I checked in, I found that it was not a parent-child room. I called the front desk to confirm. The front desk said that there was no ready-made parent-child room, and said it would take time to set it up (why didn’t you tell me when you checked in that the big bag hugged the sleeping child, Is this appropriate? Professional?). After waiting in the room for nearly an hour, the room was finally ready. Da Bao Xiao Bao hugged the sleeping child and changed floors and rooms. The new room was extremely hot, and I waited again, holding the sleeping child in the middle of the night to watch the master check the air conditioner. When did IHG fall to such an unprofessional level, it made loyal fans of more than ten years feel chilled.

There is also free afternoon tea, which is dessert.
The breakfast is also very rich. I stayed in other five-star hotels before, and the standard of the breakfast buffet is not very good. The Crown’s breakfast is nothing to say, there are many types, and there are many hot ones. We always consider children when we go out to play, and the ones that are suitable for children are the best.
In the indoor heated swimming pool on the 48th floor, the children are having fun, and the water quality is clean.
I will come again next time, and I hope this service attitude will continue.

msg:It is highly recommended that friends who come to Shenzhen can book this hotel. It is very convenient to travel. The subway is on the first floor of the hotel, and you can get to Vientiane World in one stop. It is very convenient to eat, drink, buy and buy. You only need to transfer to the subway once when you come from the high-speed rail and it is seamless. Docking, going to the Window of the World and the Nationalities Village are all convenient, and there is no need to turn. The hotel's breakfast is also quite good, with a variety of varieties and various special snacks. There are KFC, Luckin, Pacific Coffee, and pharmacies across the road. Next door is Shenzhen University. It takes 5 minutes to walk. The sightseeing bus also has a stop downstairs. We didn't take a taxi for the whole trip in Shenzhen. It's very convenient to travel. Recommended! Next time I come to Shenzhen, I will definitely choose here without hesitation.

There is a subway station downstairs. There is a shopping mall Vientiane World around, you can go to the shopping mall when you are bored. Walking is about a traffic light. When I first arrived at the hotel, the room was not cleaned properly due to hygiene. The account manager Lynn took me to the lobby bar on the 46th floor of the hotel, ordered a drink and waited for the room to be cleaned. During this period, I also introduced the surrounding environment and Shenzhen characteristics. At that time Zoe, the front desk manager of the hotel, helped me check in. The business is very professional, and her colleagues Jade, Dexter, and Edmond are all excellent. I look forward to choosing Crowne Plaza Shenzhen Railway Hotel next time I come to Shenzhen again.

Because it happened to be a holiday, I specially asked the room Xiaba Yongzong, and Zeng Shaomei to help decorate it. It was super romantic and gave a special small gift.

This swimming pool is really to boast. The ladies in the women's changing room are so cute, and they will also provide details such as band-aids, plastic bags for wet swimsuits, and so on. The hair dryer is also a Dyson. It would be even better if there is a swimsuit dryer.
The elevator has to be changed to the 46th floor for check-in and then to the guest room to ensure privacy, but it does take a few more steps. Going out is the subway station. Recommended, will come to live.

The facilities are no problem, in line with the grade of this level of hotel.
The installation of the faucet is a bit off, it is not very convenient to wash, the water flow is too fast, and the children accidentally wet their clothes.
As a parent-child room setting, the items can be more abundant and the theme can be more distinct.
The swimming pool on the 48th floor is well received and the scenery is unlimited.
The high-rise glass exterior walls are really dirty, which seriously affects the view.
Hygiene: Clean and tidy, but the quilt on the first night has a slight smell.
Environment: convenient! Shenzhen University Station of Metro Line 1 is just outside the station, so it is convenient to go anywhere.
Service: From welcoming guests to the front desk, the aunts who have already cleaned are very enthusiastic. The aunt on the 35th floor saw the baby crying and gave a little rabbit doll
New Year's celebration activities: Yes, I made dumplings and made buns
Breakfast: There are too many people during the Spring Festival, there is a queue for breakfast😂, the dishes are okay, everything you need is there, but the coffee machine is always broken

Overall, it can score 95 points, and I will choose to stay here again when I come to Shenzhen next time👍

There is Nantou Ancient City in the surrounding area to visit, and the guest room overlooks a large area of Nanshan District, which is very spectacular. The lobby is on the 46th floor. When I arrived at the hotel, I was very enthusiastic to take my luggage and the service was considerate. However, because it was a holiday, I said that the room had not been cleaned up and I had to wait for more than an hour. In the end, I had to go out for a stroll and wait for a while when I came back at night. Therefore, The efficiency of holidays needs to be enhanced. The rooms are clean and well-equipped, and the mini version of the drink is free, as well as fruit. There were too many people queuing up for breakfast (maybe because of the holidays). Fortunately, we went there at 8:30 and barely had a seat. We saw a long queue outside halfway through the meal. The breakfast is quite rich, with many types and good taste. The oa**eal and cream-filled croissants are particularly delicious, but there is no drink available later. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen holiday management to improve efficiency and quality.

The disadvantage is that the 1.2-meter-wide bed in the twin room is a bit small. The high-rise environment is too quiet, and the sound insulation is also well done.

The children fell asleep quickly, and I will not be able to fall asleep until late. According to some travel notes, it is the most cost-effective five-star hotel in Shenzhen. Although we have not stayed in many five-star hotels, this one is really good! Really good value for money on an off-season weekend!

Although the parking lot is detour, it is free. Breakfast has many varieties and tastes good. It's a pity that the buffet at night can't be booked. It's too late to book, and guests can't have priority. Also, you need to pay a deposit of 1,000 yuan to move in. Oh, you are the only one who has received this in the past 10 years.

msg:1. Parking instructions are not clear
2. I bought a set meal with two dinners. The front desk did not know how to handle it. After asking, he said that there was no dinner. After showing the order, he said that his colleague made a mistake.
3. The elevator room is filled with the smell of swimming pool disinfectant
4. There are two bottles of Coke, one bottle of Sprite, and one bottle of Paris water in the minibar. The consumer price list is in the leather box on the cabinet. The price is a bit mysterious. One Coke is 28, and Paris water is 38. Most hotels offer free drinks, it's a bit unconscionable for you to be so sneaky.
5. Buffet dinner, when I arrived at the door, I said that I could not find my seat, asked me to register, arranged a seat by the window, and asked if I could change to the window 6. The seat, said no, I made a reservation, and the whole dining process went to At 9 o'clock, there were at least three tables by the window and there were no guests. When I asked for an explanation, they said that someone else had reserved a seat and didn't come. I wanted to see the order record, but the foreman promised that it was never provided.
Have to say it was a bad holiday experience, very disappointed with the hotel and would not recommend.

The biggest highlight is the high-altitude swimming pool, whether it is a heated jacuzzi or a large pool, both are great! The service attitude of the staff is also very good👍 It would be even better if there is a children's pool 😄
The front desk staff are very caring, and the floor cleaning staff are also very warm and polite. When they saw us with children, they immediately sent children's toiletries.
The breakfast is very varied and delicious.
However, the price is much more affordable than other hotels with the five-star flag. In short, I hope to continue to maintain the good aspects. In the future, whether it is myself or a friend, I will give priority to you👍

I said that I brought my two children here because I was hungry and didn’t want to drink tea. Forget it, I ordered chrysanthemum tea, 48 or 58, or counting by bit. Isn't it pressing the pot? Forget it, the service was really slow at the beginning. There were not many seats, so I just waited and drank tea for more than half an hour. Maybe as a northerner, I don't know where I am, which caused trouble for the hotel.

🔔Service: There was a little accident during this stay, but the hotel's response speed and processing speed are still very fast, and the communication throughout the process is very pleasant. Originally, I arranged balloons or something in the room. Because of the accidental change of rooms, the hotel also helped to restore the scene perfectly, and also arranged additional arrangements on the bed and bathtub. Thank you very much~

Catering: The room includes double breakfast. It is surprising that the breakfast can be reached at 11 o'clock on weekends. And the food is very rich. There are raw porridge, rice rolls, handmade wonton noodles, pancakes and fruits, omelets, etc., which are made on the spot. The products are quite good👍🏻 Strong Amway

A small suggestion, the quality of the reception staff at the front desk on the first floor of the hotel is very different from the overall service of the hotel, and I hope to strengthen the training. There was no one at the door to guide you where to get to the elevator, only the lobby was on the 46th floor; and when I came in, I asked a courier if I could help you get it in, and the other party only said that I would pick it up at the door.
All in all, the experience is still very good, and I will come again in the future~

msg:This is the first time I came to the Crowne Plaza in Nanshan. Compared with Futian and Longgang in Shenzhen, Nanshan is the flagship store of Crowne Plaza. The high reception lobby makes people feel very comfortable and spacious.

The design of the hotel room, the separation of bathroom and toilet, and the lack of obvious partition of the washroom space, the design of continuation of the sense of space, is the popular design of five-star hotels in the past five years.

The overall quality of the buffet dinner is good, there are some surprises, such as garlic bone, soufflé, marshmallow, etc., but there are also disappoin**ents. The seafood is equivalent to the same five-star hotel. The quality of the steak is also quite average, and the wine is only Two beers. The breakfast is exquisite and overall quite satisfactory. The parent-child play area of the restaurant can be re-planned, which is a bit shabby.

The location is near the Nanshan Science and Technology Park. The entrance is on the moving line that is not easy to drive. If you get off the wrong intersection, you need to go around a large circle, which can strengthen the entrance sign.

Overall, it is the flagship store of Crowne Plaza, and it also conforms to the quality of IHG. Some minor adjus**ents will be better. It is worth recommending to everyone.

msg:I brought my children to stay for a few days during the Chinese New Year and came here after watching the parent-child activities.
🚗 Transportation: The location is easy to find. Next to Shennan Avenue, the entrance is the subway station. When you come in, you can go directly to the 46th floor to the front desk, so as soon as you enter the door, it looks a little deserted and you are alone. But they will also help with opening the door and carrying luggage.
🔔Service: From check-in to the room, the service is good. The scenery of the parent-child room booked is indeed not as good as the other side. The energy storage building is too high.
🧹Sanitation: The room is clean and tidy, the facilities are very new, especially the bathtub, the parent-child room has tent doll building blocks
Some parent-child activities are making rings, making biscuits and chocolates, or drawing and graffiti, which are more popular with children.
There was a little problem with the first night's stay. The concierge Alex, Cody, and Lucas knew that they would actively solve it in the future. They upgraded the suite and made an exception to arrange a new set of parent-child products and toys. When checking out, there is follow-up understanding and tracking of the aftermath, and a complete management model has been achieved in terms of services
Holiday's service gave me a new understanding once again. I have stayed in various hotels in many cities because of my previous work. In fact, there are many holidays. I only know that the buffet is a very affordable feature. This time I think the service is also first-class.
The swimming pool of the hotel is absolutely good. The water quality is clear and there is no smell of disinfectant. The most important thing is that there is a small hot spring pool. Children like it too much.

It may be Chinese New Year. The view of the swimming pool is very good, but there are a few people, obviously there are not enough service staff, and there are insufficient supply of towels and chaos in the locker room.
Because there was some problem with the reservation before, thanks to Lucas and Alex for their active handling, the response was very quick and praised👍
All in all, it's not bad, the kids love it.
🚗 Transportation: Parking is very convenient, and there are many restaurants nearby
🧹Hygiene: Very good, also comes with a safety bag (with a disinfection kit inside)
🍃Environment: There is no sound insulation at all. In the early morning, you can clearly hear the sound from the next room.
🔔Service: I booked two rooms, one room did not give welcome fruit, said to make up the next day, but it was not made up.

The environment is very good and the transportation is convenient. The subway station is downstairs. Parking spaces are very adequate and very good. The lobby of the hotel is on the 46th floor. We need to wait for the check-in to catch up with the fire drill. The staff also arranged a free drink of juice from the bar, which was very considerate. The front desk is very enthusiastic and the service is attentive, especially the beautiful lady Alice introduced the situation and use of the hotel in more detail, thank you very much. The room I lived in was on the 33rd floor. The room was clean and tidy, with a large bathtub, separated from wet and dry, and the scenery outside the window was beautiful1, showing the prosperity of Shenzhen after the reform and opening up. The breakfast is very rich, the north and the south are fusion 1, the Chinese and the western are combined, the food is very good, and the spirit is doubled. It's a pity that the time is too short1. I took a peek at the gym on the top floor that is open 24 hours a day, and there is also a large swimming pool with very good water quality. Next time I go to Shenzhen, I will definitely stay here for swimming and fitness. Great stay experience. The only thing is not satisfactory, the bed in the double room is a bit small, and I feel a little afraid of falling out of the bed. 😊

The hotel lobby is on the 46th floor. Check-in is quick and the service attitude is very good. Welcome fruits and drink coupons are also given. Lobby Duty Manager Wang Qi Manager Wang attaches great importance to the customer's check-in experience, and has solved the problems encountered during check-in, and will choose to check in again next time.

msg:New hotel, the environment is particularly good. The room size is sufficient, check in on the 46th floor. The breakfast was good, and the staff enthusiastically introduced the newly introduced food and how to make the seasoning delicious, very heart-warming! However, as a professional who has been eating tofu for more than ten years (when I was young), I seriously suggest that the soybeans in the seasoning must be deep-fried, not boiled in white water. Ha ha! In short, I strongly recommend everyone to come and live!

msg:As a person who rarely commented, this stay at Shenzhen Railway Crowne Plaza Hotel can be said to be amazing to me. I was originally a picky person. Before I checked in, I came here in advance. Lucas from the concierge depar**ent took me to see the room. He took the trouble to recommend a room to me according to my needs. Even though I did not check in at the end, he still added my WeChat very enthusiastically, and then he carefully answered all my questions for me during this period of time before I checked in. Thank you very much, it is worthy of praise. When I arrived at the hotel, because there was a lot of luggage, the colleagues in the concierge depar**ent were very enthusiastic to help me with my luggage. Edmond who checked in at the front desk, Litchi and Jade also handled the procedures very professionally and promptly. Litchi also helped me with an upgrade. Seeing that I had a lot of things, I wanted me to rest in the room earlier. Edmond also sent me off. Going to the elevator, you can see that he is the badge of the wearer's Golden Key Association. The Golden Key service is really extraordinary. During the stay, I prefer to drink water. I called the customer service center and found that Lucas actually arrived at the customer service center and asked him to help send three bottles of water to the room. Then he went out to exercise in the evening. When I returned to the room, I found that the water in the room was originally taken by me. After I finished drinking, I made up three more bottles of water and left a note. Lucas helped the housekeeper to deliver it in advance. It gave people a warm and caring feeling. Call the customer service center the next day and ask the help to check out until 2 o’clock. Then, when 2 o’clock is approaching, the customer service center calls to the room and asks if the baggage guard is needed to collect the baggage and check out. Then Ezreal pushes the baggage cart a few minutes later. When I went to my room to collect my luggage and check out, it was the duty manager Vivian and Nandy who helped me check out. After the procedures were completed, Nandy also asked me if I needed a taxi, and then took me into the elevator. When I got to the third floor, the concierge James from the depar**ent has already ordered the car for me. The little buddies in the concierge depar**ent helped me load my luggage on the car and waved goodbye to me. It was a pleasant stay.

After the sofa in the lobby is moved, it becomes more cozy. The young ladies at the front desk speak very softly. Like a spring breeze, especially: Litchi Elaine chaya It depends on the actual situation every time~ It can meet my needs for late check-out. Girls really have good ink marks when they check out, and they have to blow their hair for a long time. Make-up and tidy up. Hahahaha I am really embarrassed. , But never delay the next tenant! Everyone has a very good personality and attitude, and I hope they can always be good 👍The epidemic prevention measures are in place! Everywhere you can see the aunts wiping with disinfectant, especially when the second floor parking lot comes in the elevator, the aunts will spray disinfectant on the carpet, and the security brother will carefully measure the body temperature! The elevator is also equipped with hand sanitizer! Rest assured!

1. Since I first entered the lobby, the staff greeted me enthusiastically.
2. Jade service is very good, helped me arrange the room to check in
3. I encountered a little problem after check-in. Vivian helped me solve it and changed rooms immediately after calling the front desk. The work efficiency was very high, and the cordial feeling made me feel like I was at home.
4. I was queuing up when I checked out, and a lady Ann came to ask about my check-in experience.
It feels very good to stay in!

msg:The deduction is mainly for Ctrip. The hotel booked on Ctrip turns out to be outsourced to a travel agency, and the travel agency is like a thief. It is not allowed to tell the hotel that it was booked online, but that it was booked by a friend. As for this Is it sneaky? Then after booking, there is no booking information at the front desk of the hotel, which leads to an extra half hour of check-in, and the experience is extremely poor.
Besides, the hotel is good as a whole, but the bad points are briefly mentioned, no welcome fruit, slow check-in, less afternoon tea and breakfast in the lounge and not replenished in time, few service staff, Nestle instant coffee does not match the hotel positioning and so on.

在46樓大堂就可以看到深圳灣那邊，晚上這邊還會有駐唱歌手；
在房間欣賞高大上的風景，讓人心曠神怡，很適合靜靜的思考；
健身房和早餐也很棒，我是個喜歡健身的人，他家健身房同性價比設施齊全，主要室外視覺體驗特別棒；
婷婷很貼心，退了房還問我入住體驗，給我辦理入住手續的阿石也很不錯，細心幫我辦理，門口接待小哥主動幫忙拿行李；
深鐵皇冠假日是個不錯的選擇！下次一定優選這裏，位置好，離萬象天地很近，樓下各種品牌快餐，好方便哦！

多謝前台職員Ashley Tang upgrade 去行政樓層，但如果她當時跟我清楚講介行政樓層房間可享有的獨特禮遇，就會更好。
此酒店地理位置優越，就位於深大站樓上。早餐選擇豐富，味道很好，但職員未有安排座位，客人要自己找座位，希望可改善。

在酒店吃的早飯，選品很豐富，味道還可以，十點結束，建議早點去哈，去的晚了人多，早飯的對窗的風景也相當好，心曠神怡。
無邊泳池的視野也相當不錯，特別是在落日的時候，老出片了。gym還是蠻不錯的，要是器械更多就更好了
總體還是相當相當滿意的，價格也比較適中，超預期。

msg:1、酒店位於深圳大學附近，出行非常方便，樓下1樓直接對接地鐵1號線D出口，去歡樂谷、世界之窗、萬象天地都很便利，不遠處還有9號線，去華僑城方便。
2、酒店大堂在46樓，房間需換成另外的電梯，每天都是從房間38樓搭回46樓，再轉電梯去5樓宴會廳吃早餐。也許是春節期間客人較多，不是在46樓享用早餐，整個場地氛圍差了一點，可價格菜品沒變。早餐中規中矩，建議多加一些廣東特色食品，讓外地遊客能接觸當地食品，如廣東腸粉、蒸點心、蒸包點等。
3、房間環境衞生一般，水台玻璃有灰塵，洗手枱邊發黃，潤膚露和洗手液衹剩四分之一，會有人清潔房間，但發現衞生間鋪地毯直接翻轉再鋪，沒換一塊新的，第二天發現毯子另外一面粘有頭髮和前一天的污跡。建議加強房管人員培訓，從鋪床到清潔到擺放室內物品，要統一標準。比如花了錢印製帶有酒店logo的與怡寶合作的飲用水，正常應統一將酒店logo一面呈現向顧客，這幾天發現房間的設施物品打掃後襬放都是沒規律的，感覺有點隨意。
房間其他設施齊全，設計感較時尚，洗手間乾濕分離，洗手間和床的地方用帶花紋玻璃門隔開，外面的人隱約能看見洗手間的人的一舉一動，如果是朋友入住雙人床房，難免有點尷尬😅

是次前台職員安排4間房同一樓層及同一邊，非常好。我們都選擇了特大床房，床真的超大，足夠兩大兩小睡。酒店新及有大浴缸也是我們選擇這酒店的原因，小朋友可以泡泡浴，他們都很開心。

2、入住後，前台小姐姐王若楠幫我們做了 upgrade ，風景絕美，窗户也擦的十分乾淨，看深圳灣毫無遮擋。
3、在酒店吃的早飯，選品很豐富，味道還可以，十點結束，建議早點去哈，去的晚了人多，早飯的對窗的風景也相當好，心曠神怡。
4、泳池也有，不過可惜的是正好遇到泳池保養，所以就不評價啦，gym還是蠻不錯的，要是器械更多就更好了
總體還是相當相當滿意的，價格也比較適中，超預期。

msg:女友從遠方來，特地早早訂了景觀房，也特地提前備註了希望住高樓層，結果房間廁所有煙味，當下衹有選擇低樓層房間，或是保潔進來清理，並沒有給我更好的選擇，因為實在不想去低樓層，所以選擇保潔，清了一下之後煙味也還在，送了一小盤水果，説真的也感受不太到誠意...
總結來説：
1.當客房有煙味，如果當下衹剩低樓層，應該主動提升等，而不是衹給顧客比較差的選擇
2.清理完後應該主動瞭解狀況如何，都隔天退房一陣子了值班經理才打來關心，不夠貼心
3.值班經理表示下次願意提供早餐及升等，但我還是覺得為什麼要等下次呢，第一次就做好不好嗎？
4.對於有煙味這件事我覺得是很嚴重，但處理的感覺並沒有給我足夠重視的感覺
不過有一説一，早餐很不錯，泳池跟健身房也很棒就是服務再貼心點就好了

本次入住是雙床房，舒適度不錯，就是感覺單人床有些小。廁所的天花板上有些噪音。角落的地毯上有些灰塵。
游泳池不錯，健身房沒有試用。
自助早餐還行，不算特別精緻。第一次入住大床房時比較驚艷，這次入住雙床房感覺比較普通，性價比稍差。
總體入住體驗還不錯。

酒店大堂在40多層，入住在30多層，住了三晚房間設施是我比較喜歡的現代ins風，乾淨利落，視野好，早餐比較豐富，最關鍵的是地理位置非常好，去哪裡都是地鐵幾站路，比如世界之窗，蛇口碼頭，蓮花山公園，深圳灣公園。如果再去深圳，我還是想再住這裏。
深圳屬於現代化城市，無人駕駛的地鐵，掃地車商場也是幾步一個，而且都很高大上，設計的都很有特點，隨便坐一下就能拍出街拍風，都説玩沒什麼好玩的，但是如果住下來，我覺得還是挺舒適的。

以下是對酒店房間的幾個建議：
1. 馬桶應該升級為智能馬桶；
2. 電吹風風力不足且噪音太大；
3. 淋浴頂噴力度水量不够；
4. 地毯與地板磁磚之間的接口處理得不够完美；
5. 所有的毛巾看起來都很舊.

2. 空調的製冷效果不是很好，因為以上第一點的原因，我開着最大風一晚上都感覺很熱
3. 床墊過於軟，而且感覺頭重腳輕，枕頭部位低，腳底那邊高
前台zoe服務熱情，c/o時候有致歉但是這不是你的問題，是酒店的硬件設施的問題。很可惜我發現問題的時候已經很晚了，我並不想再起床折騰着重新整理我的行李然後再換到一個不知道可不可以讓我滿意的房間去，將就着睡了一晚吧

另外酒店方面，幾點大家要注意: 1、因為是地鐵上蓋，所以自駕進出酒店都需要繞路，有一定不方便；2、旺季房間裏的小童床圍緊張，酒店無法保證，建議大家自備；3、酒店在高層，底層是寫字樓，所以上下樓需要換乘電梯，比較費時間；4、游泳池不錯，有三個區域，適合各個年齡段的小童；5、世界之窗的煙花，燃放高度低，酒店很多房間是看不到的，即使能看到，因為距離遠，也看不太清。

到1號又打電話問為啥還沒到賬，還是説酒店已經操作退款，是銀行的問題。
3號又又打電話問為啥沒到賬，五天了！終於有人用心去查一查，哦，根本就沒操作退款。

入住期間還有一兩件糟心事。給前台打電話讓送個果盤，付錢買那種。結果，人家直接理解成你要白*，根本不理你，也不問，就不搭理，等幾個小時就是不送。

停車場開車出去以後，要繞一大圈，開十分鐘才能又回到酒店。。。真是太麻煩了

msg:第一次入住深鐵皇冠假日酒店酒店就在深南大道科技園附近，深圳大學校區也在旁邊，入住的時候等了一下房間，希望下次入住不要再等房了，酒店有個忠誠客户團隊是主要負責攜程的，Monica 和Lynn，幫我辦理入住的是Zoe，酒店的景觀很好在外面看到福田區域，地王大廈跟平安大廈都依稀可見，酒店也有室內恆温的泳池，在酒店的48樓，健身房是二十四小時，還有恆温泳池開到晚上23：00！！很多酒店十點多就關門了，這個加分，早餐很不錯有煎餅果子還有廣式腸粉，外景很好，下午的時候外面的🌅 很漂亮，酒廊的日落也很美，在那裡享用晚餐真的很愜意，就是有點曬[偷笑][偷笑][偷笑]，全天候（13：00-22：00）供應飲品還有啤酒跟軟飲，歡樂時光還可以有特調，工作人員Sunny調的雞尾酒很好看，下次入住可以去酒廊讓他們再調一個不一樣的雞尾酒，酒店也有停車場入住期間免費，刷完就得趕緊走，有時效性15分鐘開走，剛好入住的時候人流量比較高，可以直接致電給總機刷車牌，好幾次都是同一個人刷的應該是叫Amanda的，入住體驗都很好，下次再來，

msg:很不錯，交通便利，附近有兩個地鐵口都能到，離附近購物遊玩的地方也挺近的，比如華潤萬象天地、世界之窗、人才公園等等…酒店員工的服務態度很好，印象最深的是賓客服務中心的Vina，服務很熱情，加了我們的微信，給我們看了親子房的圖片和導航指引，房間也不錯，明亮整潔，床上用品很舒服，五星好評！

msg:這次也是第一次來入住這家酒店，之前也聽説過這家酒店不錯，風景好，比較特別的一點是前台大堂安排在46樓，下電梯就可以看到特別開闊的風景視野，讓人忍不住停下來拍了照片，酒店有個客户團隊裏面的Aurora與我微信聯繫提前幫忙安排房間，安排得也很滿意，所以在此感謝她，還有辦理入住的Monica細心快速，熟練的給我介紹了酒店，專業程度不愧是五星級酒店的，表揚！在住幾晚過程中都是特別舒服的，令人滿意。

msg:第一次入住深鐵皇冠假日酒店，酒店位於深圳市南山區的科技園旁邊，這個位置很不錯，交通便利。酒店入住大堂在46樓，需要轉換幾個電梯。游泳池在48樓，健身房就和游泳池一牆之隔。風景很好。游泳池有個拍照打卡的地方，適合做紀念，工作人員Lynn Monica Zoe 服務都很好。下次還可以再來一次。
