We were hosted at the Flaming Building ÁÅ´ÂØ®, we enjoyed an astonishing view from there. Cloudy peaks around were an amazing sight for our waking up in the morning. Thank you to the nice lady at the reception that welcomed us at our arrival there.

We enjoyed a perfect, relaxing bath at the hot springs in the evening. Thank you very much to Deng Miao, Zhang Zhenyuan and the gentle lady at the reception for providing an excellent, welcoming and professional service there.

msg:We stayed for my partners birthday.  I must commend the English speaking staff.  They tried their best to help us when they could.  
Unfortunately this hotel is very dated and old.  The bedding and towels had obvious stains on them.  The rooms are far from other parts of the hotel so you need a cart or to walk to the next location.  The food in the Western restaurant is not very appetizing (that's where breakfast is too, for the price not worth it) ,  the Chinese restaurant is much better. 
The pool is much smaller than the pictures.  We visited in summer,  so children dominated it so we didn't feel like we could use it.  
The hotel is very close to the Grand Canyon,  however I would not stay again.

The hotel is located near the east entrance to the National Forest Park, just 10 minutes by car. Inside the hotel itself there‚Äôs a Tour Agency so it is very convenient and you can hire a guide. 
Good breakfast. 
I would definitely recommend staying there!

The hotel environment, service and meals are of very high standards. The entire resort hotel is very quiet, the air is very fresh, and the scenery is very beautiful, which makes us happy.

Hotel manager Du Fenfen provided one-to-one caring service from the beginning of our stay. She helped us check the weather forecast for the next day in advance and prepared raincoats for us. She helped us arrange a shuttle bus from the hotel to the scenic area, and also helped us plan our travel arrangements in advance and sent a car to take us to the railway station. During the two days of staying in the hotel, she communicated with us throughout the whole process. Manager Du's five-star service made us feel very considerate. Thank you very much, Manager Du, for making our vacation very pleasant this time!

In addition to Manager Du, other hotel staff are also very warm and polite. The staff of the Western restaurant breakfast department and the hot pot buffet are very friendly. The drivers of the special vehicles in the park are very friendly and available at any time. The young lady from Gengdu Academy was also very friendly when she made tea for us.

The hotel is well-equipped and we went to the fitness center. Miss Yao Li at the fitness center was warm and polite. She patiently took us to visit the fitness center and gave us suggestions on how to visit the resort hotel. We played billiards and table tennis here, and the children also got ten free game coins to play the claw machine game. The brother in the indoor swimming pool also politely reminded us that we needed a swimming cap when swimming in the indoor swimming pool.

There are also karts and archery projects here. Miss Tan Yashi, who took us to play karts, patiently explained to the children how to play karts.

The driver from the hotel to the scenic spot was also very friendly and considerate. Especially the brother Zhou Ke who took us to the airport at the end, patiently waited for us to get on the car, provided us with bottled water in the car, and enthusiastically introduced Zhangjiajie to us on the way.

The entire hotel, five-star facilities, first-class service. Friends who come to Zhangjiajie Wulingyuan for vacation, this Hetian Village Resort Hotel must be the first choice.

The hotel is located between Tianmenshan National Forest Park and the Grand Canyon. If you go to the scenic spot, there are fixed shuttle buses every day. Just make an appointment with the front desk in advance. The hotel also provides airport pick-up or drop-off services, which is very considerate.

This hotel is located between the Zhangjiajie Grand Canyon Scenic Area (Glass Bridge) and the Huanglong Cave Scenic Area. It only takes 12 minutes to get to these two scenic spots, and less than 20 minutes to the core scenic spot Wulingyuan National Forest Park. To the airport, It takes about 45 minutes to reach the high-speed rail station and Tianmen Mountain. It is worth mentioning that their hotel has cars to pick you up at these places or send you there from the hotel, which is more convenient. The service is also worthy of praise. Whether it is the front desk, guest room or restaurant, the waiters are sincere, polite and caring. They will take the initiative to understand your travel plans and give you some suggestions, which saves you a lot of trouble. There is a newly opened forest hot spring in the hotel. It is located outdoors on the hillside. It is a very good experience. I recommend you to try it if you live there [strong]

msg:I rarely write reviews, but this time I must write a good review for Hetianju. I also want to take the opportunity to thank my Butler Du and Butler Deng.

I usually stay at the Hilton Marriott and have their Diamond Platinum card. This time I chose Hotanju mainly because of the hotel environment. But I really didn't expect that Hetianju's service facilities are also very online. At the same price level, it gave me an experience beyond my expectations.

1. Hotel environment: It is very large, surrounded by mountains and rivers, and the environment is very good, even better than what I saw online. If you're not in a hurry, it's nice to take a walk there; there seems to be a tennis court, but I didn't have time to see it.

2. Hotel service: impeccable, beyond expectations. The housekeepers are very serious and responsible. They put themselves in our shoes and take good care of us like family members, instead of being utilitarian or perfunctory.

- First of all, before check-in, since the hotel is far away from the city, he helped us arrange a pick-up and drop-off in advance; he also actively coordinated the room type to meet our needs as much as possible; even if it was very late, Butler Du responded quickly. Before the trip, he also helped us prepare raincoats and snacks.

- Secondly, for the arrangement of this trip, thanks to Butler Deng, who is in charge of tourism at Hotanju, he covered the entire journey. He helped us book tickets and plan routes for free, and also contacted reliable tour guides, which helped us save a lot of time and energy (there was also a small Interlude, it was only on the last day that I discovered that I had given the wrong time and bought the wrong ticket, and Butler Deng also found a way to help solve the problem, leaving no regrets)

Traveling during the National Day is not easy. I am really grateful to my two beautiful housekeepers for helping me all the way. Thank you for your hard work! Next time I come to play, or recommend to friends, I will definitely choose Hetianju.

The service has nothing to do with professionalism. You can't say it doesn't exist, it does! But it feels more like a 500-yuan hotel. The huge hotel only has a few villagers working as staff, as if they are still making a last-ditch struggle to prevent it from being completely abandoned. . . . .
The restaurant is even more so, it has nothing to do with the thousand-dollar hotel. . . . There is a feeling of darkness that you can‚Äôt even pay for the light bulb!
I can't understand the way this hotel exists and charges high prices. This is the world-famous Zhangjiajie. Why are the hotels so bad?

In addition, I highly recommend the hotel's Chinese restaurant. I ate a few meals outside the hotel, but it was not as delicious as He Tianju Chinese restaurant. There are resident singers at night and the a**osphere is very good.
I hope the hotel can upgrade the facilities in the room. The Huozhai we booked was upgraded to Muzhai. The room is very clean, but the facilities are still a bit old, especially the sofa.

But now when I leave, I am already planning my second trip. Housekeeper Xiao Wu has managed to make her feel more at home than the housekeepers at Ritz-Carlton and St. Regis. To be honest, it is rare, and you can feel her love for the hotel and this job. Thank you very much to Xiao Wu and all the staff for taking care of us. We look forward to seeing you next time!

It is worth commending the hotel's butler Xiao Du, who is very considerate, enthusiastic and patient. He helped us arrange the departure car and planned the departure route, saving time. We don't have to return to the hotel from the scenic spot to pick up our luggage. There is no need to worry about it. The hotel car came directly to the designated place to pick us up and take us to the next destination. Butler Xiao Du also arranged breakfast for the children and sent toothbrushes over. The children especially like this hotel because they are going to Tianmen Mountain , and because of the itinerary, I can't stay a few more nights, and I haven't had enough fun. I will definitely choose this hotel next time, like it!

msg:The first time I came to Zhangjiajie, I chose this resort hotel. The location is a bit out of the way, but in Wulingyuan District, it is almost ten kilometers to Wulingyuan, Baofeng Lake, Huanglong Cave, Eternal Love, Grand Canyon and other scenic spots. Far. The hotel has a shuttle service to the airport and train station, and there are several shuttle buses to pick up and drop off at Wulingyuan and the Grand Canyon every day, which is very thoughtful. This time I booked a little yellow duck-themed parent-child room. The children liked it very much as soon as they entered. The hotel's buffet breakfast is rich in variety and can be eaten until 10:30. It is more friendly to guests who like to sleep in. The hotel is relatively large, the housing is relatively scattered, and there are Chinese restaurants, Western restaurants, fitness centers, conference centers, etc. You can pick up and drop off by battery cars wherever you go in the hotel. In particular, I would like to praise Wang Yan at the front desk of the hotel, for her very detailed, warm and thoughtful service, answering every question, very thoughtful. I seldom write such a long review, mainly because I gave the hotel service a full score this time, and the children also said that this is the hotel with the best service they have ever stayed in, and they will stay again next time.

There are battery cars to pick you up and drop off at every place. The hotel has also upgraded the service. Muzhai is a villa, basically in the center of the park, downstairs There are small shops and self-service barbecues.

I would like to commend the drivers Master Tian and Li Feifei. When I went to see the nine mountain ghosts, I came out late and missed the hotel shuttle bus, because it was late and I couldn‚Äôt get a taxi. Through Feifei's patience and coordination, Master Tian even specially picked us up for a trip alone, thank you very much! In addition, the service of the hotel is also good, the sanitation is very clean, the weather forecast in the south is not accurate, one day it rains, the hotel also helped to collect the clothes on the balcony, very thoughtful!

The Chinese hot pot was okay on the first day, but on the second day, four hot dishes were served together, and both dishes were cold. There are quite a lot of varieties for breakfast, but the eatability is relatively poor. For example, the butter for pastries may not be preserved well, resulting in a strange smell in the biscuits delivered to the room and the bread for breakfast. The pot was not cleaned and the smell was not normal.

msg:To be honest, this so-called best hotel in Zhangjiajie is very disappointing regardless of hardware or software. First of all, the hardware. The hotel is grateful for the free upgrade of the Shuizhai Villa, but in the innermost building, the room is too big and there is no air conditioner in the bathroom. The air conditioner in the room can only be maintained at 21 degrees, and the temperature in the bathroom is only about 10 degrees. Every time I came out of the shower, I was shivering with cold, and when I called the maintenance man, the only answer was that our design was unreasonable. Secondly, let‚Äôs talk about the software. The so-called 24-hour butler service only added a WeChat account named Pengpeng after the check-in request. Afterwards, Pengpeng‚Äôs attitude is still very good, but the other services of the hotel are really not enough, and the luggage will not be moved. On the second floor, I didn‚Äôt help move it down at all. Aunt Lincao didn‚Äôt change the spare parts or wash the cups on the first day. After complaining on the second day, she washed the tea cups and put them on the table in the bathroom. The red wine glasses still didn‚Äôt washüòÇüòÇüòÇ

First of all, this is indeed a resort hotel that is impeccable in terms of hardware. Because of the epidemic, it is necessary to accompany my daughter to stay in Hetianju because of the epidemic. I have a certain understanding of the hotel. Today, I mainly want to express my gratitude to the staff of Hetianju. The whole process is full of warm feelings. Huang Guihua (Lobby Manager) We have never met, but all the problems raised through WeChat have been resolved and made people feel very comfortable. For example, due to work reasons, our family of three stayed in two batches. The hotel sent a car to pick us up from the airport and the high-speed rail station, and the package I ordered from Ctrip was free pick-up and drop-off, so we left the hotel and went to the high-speed rail station to get a taxi at our own expense ( The cost is nearly 200), but before leaving, Manager Huang told us that the hotel has arranged a car and does not need to pay at his own expense. Another incident was that my daughter forgot a favorite dress by the pool when she was traveling in a hotel, only to find out when she came home. When I sent the courier address to Manager Huang Guihua, I emphasized the use of "pay on delivery" for expressing the dress, but I received the courier today and was told that the courier fee had been paid. The skirt was received so quickly and I am very grateful to the little sister Tang Yuan who was photographed by the hotel. The above are small things, but what I feel is the a**osphere of Mr. Huang and the pattern of the five-star hotel. My daughter and her mother urged me to write a good review as soon as I got home, and I would like to thank Master Yang and Master Zhao of the hotel team. From the moment I got in their car, I felt at home, warm, attentive, and sincerely thankful. Next time we will come to Hetianju again.

msg:In fact, I chose Hetian at the beginning because I gave up Crowne Plaza with a little expectation for domestic resort hotels. After all, the room price of Hetian is higher (2022.8.19-1090).
Check-in - the whole check-in movement is very strange.

Room - The smell of the tide in the room, maybe the room has not been occupied for a long time, so it is very damp.

There are no disposable slippers, so I called to ask for them. The service staff said they were changing shifts and wanted to eat, so let us wait.

Let me talk about the hotel environment that attracted me at the beginning. How should I put it, I feel that if it weren‚Äôt for the epidemic in the summer vacation of 2022, the hotel would have closed down. The vegetation in the park is not taken care of, and the outdoor swimming pool of such a large hotel is too small.

Sleeping at night, that cicada barking should not be too loud! I understand that the weather is hot, but this cicada is really the loudest I have ever heard. Anyway, this room basically has no sound insulation from the outdoors.

Breakfast - The breakfast was ok, but there is a story I want to tell you. I went to breakfast in the morning and asked for a bowl of noodles. At this time, I saw an employee wearing their ordinary waiter clothes (this person is definitely not the person who should appear in the restaurant), walked into the kitchen where the noodles were cooked, and brought the noodles to him. I cooked it myself. The young man who was supposed to cook the noodles also stepped aside silently, wondering if this person was their leader.

I originally booked this hotel for 2 nights, but after sleeping for one night, I ran away decisively! Still went to Crowne Plaza.

msg:Transportation: It's a little far from Wulingyuan, but the hotel's pick-up and shuttle service is very rich, and the traffic problem is well covered
Hygiene: The hotel has a large number of service managers, garden depar**ent, room service depar**ent, etc. The hygiene is in place. The cleanliness of the entire park is very high.
Environment: Needless to say, the environment is surrounded by mountains. Children in the city fall in love with it as soon as they arrive.
Service: Service is definitely one of the highlights of Hetian Residence. The application of butler-style service here makes this trip really feel at home. Our housekeeper, Xiaodu, driver, and Master Yang are all excellent hotel service personnel. We can get all basic needs of WeChat. In response to the shuttle bus, the hotel will bring drinking water to the scenic spots every day. When I come back, I will help to lay the bathtub in the room. The disposable cover will be used when I come to Zhangjiajie again. If the housekeeper Xiao Du is still there, I will contact you again. Butler Xiaodu's service is really good

msg:Transportation: The hotel is located next to the Huanglong Cave Scenic Spot, a 20-minute drive from the sign gate of Wulingyuan National Forest Park. We went by car, the place is easy to find, the scenery along the way is also good, and it is very convenient to park after arriving.
üåüTips: The hotel provides pick-up/drop-off service.

Hygiene: Generally speaking, it is relatively clean and tidy, far surpassing many B&Bs and hotels nearby. But the details still need to be strengthened. Years of experience: Problems such as small insects and damp bedding are common problems in this type of mountain-style hotel, and even many star-rated hotels cannot be avoided.

Environment: Built on the mountain, the air is fresh, the environment is pleasant, and the scenery is not inferior to some scenic spots. It is very pleasant to stroll through it, which is very suitable for vacation and leisure. The movie of the infinity pool at the internet celebrity check-in point is not too good-looking. Next to the Chinese restaurant in the hotel, you need to walk through a quiet small area to find it. There are many children playing in the water. Walking on the road, you can also encounter surprises such as small squirrels, and there are many fruit trees in the park.
üåüSmall Tip: The hotel park is very big, but there are shuttle buses that you can take.

Service: Although the service awareness cannot be compared with that of five-star hotels in first-tier cities, the service staff encountered are more patient and friendly, and they can respond immediately... The little sister at the front desk helped us upgrade the villa room for free and open the connection The little brother of the car also let the children see the surprise of the little squirrel üêøÔ∏è‚Ä¶
Small Tip: You can call directly in the room to reserve a shuttle bus, which is very convenient to go anywhere. But with such a beautiful scenery, it is more recommended to take a walk.

‚ú®Key points: 1. Takeaways cannot be delivered near the hotel. The hotel has its own restaurants, Chinese restaurants, Western restaurants and supermarkets.
2. The room types in the villages of the same price are also somewhat different, and the comfort of the rooms in Muzhai and above will be higher.
3. The Suoxi (river?) in front of the hotel feels as good as the Golden Whip Stream. The tidal flat is huge and the water is very clear. You can stay at the hotel without visiting the scenic spots. Compared with queuing up in the scenic spot to watch the crowd, you can go to the river to catch crabs and fish for small fish, so that children have more fun.

msg:Room: The overall cost performance of Huozhai is not high, and the hygiene is very poor. As soon as you enter the door, you can smell the instant noodle seasoning package. There are a lot of group guests, so there is basically no need to sleep at six in the morning, there is basically no sound insulation, and it feels like sleeping in the aisle. There is a bed facing the washing window, no curtains, and the sun shines in in the morning, which is very dazzling.
Service: You can't make an appoin**ent even if you call an electric car when you go out, even if you make an appoin**ent ten minutes in advance, you can only call when you go out, and you can call a car most of the time. There are relatively few staff. The next day, I suggested that the room was not clean and the sound insulation effect was not good. If there was a room to change, the front desk replied that someone would be called over to see it. I didn‚Äôt see the staff coming up until I checked out. The hotel is suitable for self-driving, and it is difficult to get a car. Sooner or later, there is a shuttle bus to the Forest Park and the Grand Canyon.
Environment: The external environment of the hotel should be the only plus point.

msg:Never stayed in such a bad hotel.
1. When the car arrived at the hotel, there were four male staff at the door. They saw that I was carrying two children, a large suitcase and two large bags, but none of them came to help with the luggage.
2. When eating in a Chinese restaurant, the chairs need to be moved by yourself. The most basic Hunan dishes are served in three pots. Ask the waiter what dishes are in it, but I don't know. After eating two dinners in a row, I found that the chicken soup with the rock ear and the fish soup have the same taste.
3. Ask the swimming pool staff, where is the locker room, point your finger, go down to the street light, go down and see that it is not a locker room at all, then climb the stairs and find that it turns right at the street light, the staff is so sympathetic, It's not enough to say two words to turn right.
4. On a day of 37 or 8 degrees, it will take a long time for the battery car to come.
5. The sanitation of the room was not cleaned at all, and the water in the washbasin could not flow down.
6. The breakfast is messy, there is no seat, you need to wait for a table with your own plate, and no one will make up for it. The noodle stall does not take the number, and there is no queue, which makes it angry to see that there are guests who have not received noodles for two consecutive batches. gone.
In short, it's hard to say, don't be tempted by the swimming pool, only the swimming pool is beautiful, but staying in a hotel is not a swimming pool, no matter how beautiful, the service can't keep up, is it bad to spend money on it?

I was worried that there would be pits everywhere in the group tour. I didn‚Äôt expect that the hotel could help us handle it. Not only is it much cheaper than outside, but we can play whatever we want every day without any hidden consumption. How can we save money and play? This hotel really has no choice. There is also Peng Yinhua, the front office manager, the front desk housekeeper, who arranges fruit drinks for us every day. The lobby manager Du Fenfen and the team Li Yimin thank every hotel staff. This is a very satisfying trip, and I will definitely stay here when I come to Zhangjiajie in the future.

However, the rooms of the villas and hotels I have stayed in before have varying degrees of humidity or musty smell, and there are also small bugs ~ but the Hetianju room has no musty smell, and the room on the first floor is worried about the humidity. The hotel also opened a dehumidifier. , Because there is no note when booking the room that several rooms are open together. When I arrive at the hotel, there are no rooms on the same floor. If I want to change rooms, the hotel staff take the trouble to explain and look at various room types, and arrange it in a short time. This time because of the rainy weather I couldn't check in the outdoor swimming pool, but the indoor heated swimming pool made up for the regrets of the children, the water quality is good, and the hotel has different parent-child game equipment to choose from I gave detailed suggestions~ I will not hesitate to choose this hotel when I go to Zhangjiajie in the future.

msg:The real oxygen bar, the environment is too pleasant. Comparable to the environment is the service of the resort, which is too attentive. This is a parent-child trip. The children are very satisfied with the free access to the "Children's Paradise" and "Game Room". The outdoor swimming pool is something we must experience next time. Our housekeeper, Xiao Du, was very caring and warm and thoughtful to entertain us. All kinds of matters during the check-in were resolved in time. When he left the store, he also sent fruit very thoughtfully. Looking forward to next stay

He also helped us with luggage. I rushed to the Forest Park in the morning and didn‚Äôt have time for breakfast. The front desk was very nice to help with packing. The housekeeper Xiao Du was really considerate. When we were in a hurry, he helped us to come up with ideas together, and he also helped us with the shuttle bus for free, I know We didn't buy water, we even sent a few bottles of water on purpose.

msg:üöó Transportation: Suitable for self-driving, convenient parking.
üßπSanitation: Lived in two room types. The water village is sanitary and cleaner than the fire village. The first night I stayed in Huozhai, there were matches dropped by guests on the ground last time, clothes and glass balls dropped by children. There are flying animal carcasses under the pillows. The water village on the second night did not have the above problems, but there was a big fly in the house, and I asked the front desk for a fly swatter. The front desk answered no and did not mention a solution. Later, the flies killed themselves and affected the mood!

üçÉEnvironment: Don‚Äôt say much, just look at the picture and talk, it‚Äôs great!
üîîService: The service is uneven. First of all, the staff in the recreation center have the best service attitude, very kind, patient and enthusiastic. The second is the driver of the battery car. During the period, I took the battery car several times. The quality is very high. Very comfortable, not impatient, and very talkative. The front desk is relatively general, which is rather blunt, and no one answered the front desk phone a few times.
***Emphasis: This hotel is still far from the resort hotel. Suggestion 1. Replace all the chefs in the hotel and went to the best Chinese restaurant in the hotel in Ctrip reviews (compared to the other two restaurants in the hotel). Suspected the chef came in through the back door, and none of the dishes could be swallowed. The restaurant outside will eat as far away as the hotel, and never eat again. I remind everyone who stays in the hotel, it is best to choose here to bring your own dry food or eat out. Never eat at the hotel, it will make you have no good impression of the hotel in an instant! There was a dish that was originally a hot dish. It felt like a cold dish when it came up. I saw that it was longer when it was put. After I gave the waiter a suggestion, it went back to the kitchen and heated it up. What the dish is called Xiaomi Chicken seems to be, I should I moved three chopsticks to maintain the original appearance of the dishes. Are you hungry? I am really hungry, but I would rather be hungry than have your mouth, so you don‚Äôt have to eat in this hotel. I also suggest to the hotel that the more important aspect of a resort hotel is dining. What is a vacation when you always go out to eat. Recommendation 2. Service personnel should strengthen training and reward the good and punish the bad.
All in all, with such a good hardware foundation, don't let some details ruin it. It may be a bit too much to say, but it is for the sake of the hotel to be better, and I hope to adopt it.

üßπHygienic: clean and hygienic, clean in time

üçÉEnvironment: The whole hotel is like a forest oxygen bar. It‚Äôs not bad to soak in the hotel. It‚Äôs a pity that I can‚Äôt swim outdoors due to the weather.

üîîService: Breakfast from 6:30 to 10:30, very convenient, breakfast strawberry puffs are delicious! The Chinese restaurant tastes good too, and the ingredients for the three pots are quite sufficient

msg:Half a month before November, I booked this hotel. At that time, the price of the most common room was around 1300 yuan. Then I took another look before the November holiday and found that all the rooms have been reduced in price. The most common room was directly reduced from 1300 to more than 900. Later, I retired all the previous reservations, and decisively upgraded the room types of better water village villas. First of all, this pricing matter made me feel a little pitted. Next, let‚Äôs talk about the key point. Although the first water village is called a water village, there is a stream outside the window and it is completely blocked by trees. The comfortable environment, as a result, there is a national highway outside the water village. From morning to night, there are cars roaring by. There is no quiet at all. There are cars outside at 2 o'clock in the evening, which is too noisy. Thirdly, that is the most excessive. We drove there by ourselves. In the last two days, the waiter at the hotel‚Äôs entrance used the government as a charter to prevent all passengers from parking in the parking lot of the hotel, but to the parking lot across the road. , And then walked back by myself, and had to cross the road, which was very inconvenient. People from the Hunan government drag their families to book the venue during the National Day holiday. They are definitely not for work. In the current social a**osphere and specializations to isolate the people, I will not comment for the time being. The hotel isolates us, let us put The car parked on the opposite side and let us walk back on our own. My husband had theorized with the staff and said that he wanted to go up to see if there is an empty parking space. If he didn‚Äôt stop to the opposite side, the other party couldn‚Äôt help knocking on our door and had to let us stop. Going to the opposite side, he looks straightforward and has no sense of service. Can it be called a five-star resort hotel? Later, I called the front desk to complain to the manager. The manager's attitude was even worse. Even if there is no parking space, this attitude is not the same. I have stayed Many hotels have never seen anything worse than this attitude. If it‚Äôs not that the room can‚Äôt be returned, I‚Äôd like to move out on the same day. First, I won‚Äôt stay in this hotel. Second, I‚Äôll share it with me. Everyone around, let everyone not live.

She will stare at the whole process to prevent accidents; there is also a male employee who is very good, telling us many suggestions, and the route time, which is particularly useful; female employees in the Recreation Depar**ent The facilities and business hours were introduced throughout the whole process. It is really the most satisfying depar**ent for us to live here. Wang Yan at the front desk was also very good. There was an accident when she checked in.

The water village I stayed in happened to be on the roadside. I had communicated with the hotel in advance and requested to arrange a quiet room, but it did not. Later, Ctrip members were used to upgrade the room, from the superior room to the deluxe premium (that is, the first floor to the second floor), but the hotel arranges the smaller room type in the deluxe room, thank you Ctrip! Slightly disappointed with the hotel, not generous enough. All air-conditioning in rooms and public areas is set at 25-26, which cannot be adjusted, which is very stuffy and not very comfortable. The waiters are very enthusiastic, especially the waiter Yao Li.
