msg:This place is perfect for unwinding. It is located 15 minutes away from the main road. The hotel offered free pick up and drop off so the distance to the main area is not really a problem. Very peaceful and has a splendid view from the cabin. The amenities were also impressive. 

We would have loved to have:
1. A map or guide for more leisure possibilities such as hiking trails around the area. We only were to explore by ourselves by walking down to a beautiful ******* village. 
2. More options for breakfast. Compared to other hotels in the same price category, the breakfast is too simple. 
3. As the cabin is using smart home technology, a user manual or a short instruction on paper would be helpful. 

Overall, our stay was relaxing and worth the price.

msg:First of all, transportation is very inconvenient. If you are not driving by yourself, I don’t recommend this. You should also wear anti-skid chains when driving by yourself. Because there is little sunlight on the mountain, the road will be very slippery when it snows, and it is difficult to get down even if you can’t get up.
Because we had to catch the morning bus to catch the high-speed train, the hotel didn't give us a drop-off. They said the snow would be cleared at seven o'clock, but the snow clearing hadn't started at eight o'clock. If we couldn't find a local rental, it would be over. We wouldn't be able to keep up with the rest of the trip, and the rental price would be much more expensive. , the rental company said they can’t listen to the hotel’s instructions.
The hotel didn’t even mention the ******* souvenirs included in the package. Food in the hotel is very expensive, and the same yak hot pot is twice as expensive. If you go to Mizoguchi, you can eat a lot, and the portion is large and cheap.
Power outages at night when it snows can freeze people. We experienced a power outage for nearly half an hour. The darkness was very scary. The hotel's water heater ran out of hot water after a short period of use.
If you are staying, it is recommended to buy delicious food. Of course, if you are rich, you can do anything. It is even more recommended to go to Hilton Hideaway.
It takes ten minutes to drive from Luneng Town to the hotel.
In short, I've been there once and that's enough. I don't dare to go a second time.

However, the service attitude was very good. Because I couldn't get a taxi, the front desk arranged for the chef to go down the mountain to pick me up. There is also the issue of taking a shower. I took a shower an hour after my wife finished taking a shower, but there was no water in the middle of the shower. I asked the front desk and they said it would take an hour. In the end, after waiting for more than two hours, it didn't work. I ended up taking a shower in the free room. Yes, this experience was terrible.

msg:The scenery is 100 points, full marks! The view is even better than that of the Ten Thousand Yuan Hotel not far away. I bought two 999 Yuan packages and stayed for four nights in total. The price/performance ratio is very high. One thing to note is that the hotel is located on the top of a mountain, so the water pressure of the hot water is definitely not enough. The water flow is very thin, but it is no problem to take a shower and wash your hair; the room uses a smart system to control the lights and curtains, has a Bluetooth speaker, the toilet is also heated, and there is floor heating, which is really awesome; in addition, takeaway is not available, and the hotel has its own restaurant , the price is not high and delicious, the cold dishes for breakfast are super delicious, it is my favorite, and the service attitude of the staff is also very good; the only drawback is that the hotel pick-up and drop-off are separate, and they are sent to the bottom of the mountain at 08:20, and then Change the minibus to the entrance of the scenic spot at 08:40, and send it back down the mountain/directly to the hotel at 16:20 in the afternoon. I think this should be made clear to the guests in advance. If I knew in advance that the pick-up and drop-off would be separate, I would have taken a taxi myself. See Other reviews said that it is difficult to take a taxi, but I used Didi to take a taxi on the night I arrived. I used the same driver for subsequent pick-ups and drop-offs, so friends who are coming to stay do not need to worry about this. At this price, I can stay in such a good hotel. Overall, I am very satisfied with it. It can even be said that I found a treasure.

msg:This is not a bad review, I hope this review can give some reference to future guests.

1. Choose this hotel carefully if you are not driving by yourself, because the location is slightly remote from the scenic spot, in the innermost part of the valley and at the top of the mountain road. Taxi drivers rarely take orders because they cannot show the mileage on the meter, and it is easy to ask for the price without using the meter ( It is a common phenomenon in Jiuzhaigou scenic spots that it is best to take a taxi from a regular platform), so it is usually not possible to get a taxi from the hotel down the mountain. We just try our luck and sometimes the hotel will have a taxi to go down the mountain. (It would be better to return to the hotel from the scenic spot, but the 2022 hotel manager’s response in the Q&A that “a free shuttle to the scenic spot” is not true!)
2. The hotel pick-up attendant has no direct relationship with the hotel. They are usually cars from the fleet. Don’t blindly trust them. Compare prices after adding your contact information. (This time we traveled from the hotel to Huanglong and back, the car provided by the hotel was better than our own. Consulted rentals are higher than 200).
3. The hotel's water restrictions are a major disadvantage. There is no warm notice on the details page. After check-in, a check-in instruction reminder will be issued: "The room is heated by a separate water storage. The weather is cold and the temperature rises slowly. The amount of hot water is insufficient for continuous use (such as using a bathtub). ) There will be no hot water in the shower room." We checked in early in the morning, and the front desk did not send check-in instructions in time. As a result, the first person took a 15-minute shower on the second night and the second person cut off the hot water in the middle of the shower (without staying in the room to use the hot water from the sink). ), wait at least two hours for the water to slowly heat up (should also depend on the weather).

To sum up, the scenery of the Earth Warehouse is undeniable, the accommodation style is also very novel, and the attitude of the guys and girls at the front desk is very good. However, compared with the refined butler-style services of Conrad, Hilton and other brand hotels, the Earth Warehouse can be said to be a fully self-service experience. I hope it can give some help to netizens who are struggling.

I will recommend this store to my friends. It is very suitable for working people to relax and take a vacation. It is very cost-effective.
If you like to eat snacks, it is recommended to bring some food by yourself. There are no shops nearby and you will have no choice but to eat at the hotel.

🚌The hotel provides a shuttle bus to the foot of the mountain. It takes about 20 minutes to transfer to the tourist attraction CMB to Jiuzhaigou attractions.
🥘In terms of food, the hotel provides small hot pot (the mutton is very fresh) and stir-fry options, and watermelon is served for breakfast‼ ️ If you want more choices, there are restaurants in Luneng Town and fast food KFC at the foot of the mountain. Takeaways cannot be delivered, so it is recommended to order them at the foot of the mountain and bring them up.
The service is heartwarming. We caught a cold during this period, so the aunt in the restaurant helped us make ginger soup and cola. The driver took us to the Yama****a Medical Clinic to get some medicine🥰

The ecological environment is very good. You can see cattle and rabbits wandering in. If there are small insects in the room, you can ask the staff to catch them and release them.

The rooms are made of containers or glass wooden houses. The furniture is relatively original, most of it is made of wood, so it is easy to get damp and moldy. Breakfast is relatively simple, and dinner is It's good to be able to pay for your own meals. The service response was very timely.

msg:The scenery is really incomparable. It's even more beautiful than a five-star hotel. You can tell by looking at the pictures that it's a special feature. I even met Little Rabbit. I can see that everyone is very attentive to the service, but I can't praise the hygiene. I booked the bathroom for two nights and one night. The musty smell of the wooden floor forced me to cancel one night. I opened the doors and windows during the day and it was not obvious, but I had to close the windows and doors at night. The musty smell was really serious. The anti-theft lock of the first house I moved into had been disconnected. After coordinating with the staff, they helped me move to another house, but the same problems were the same: stains on the sofa and mold on the wooden floor in the bathroom. You can't order takeout in the surrounding area. You can only eat in the hotel, so the price is on the high side. The taste is not bad. I ordered a grilled fish, a bowl of rice and a drink for a total of 150 yuan. There are relatively few types of breakfast, soy milk and fried dough sticks are quite delicious. Because the scenery is very beautiful, it is a good choice to stay for one night. I really want to suggest that the hotel replace the wooden floor in the bathroom, otherwise it will really waste such a beautiful view. I especially want to visit again in a different season. I hope I can see the new bathroom floor next time. Even cement floors can get moldy. I was so afraid that I didn’t even dare to wash my hair and rinse it out.

I had some doubts about my decision. But after arriving at the hotel, the hotel upgraded the rooms, and the rooms were very good. The joy immediately replaced the fatigue of the journey. The next day, when you get up and open the curtains, if you love nature, you must be extremely excited. This is not even the most beautiful spring and autumn season, it is already very exciting. In retrospect, although it is rather secluded, I came here to escape from the world. Even when I went to Jiuzhaigou, I went back to the hotel at dawn to take photos and then went in and out for dinner. In the end, something was missing, and the store took the trouble to communicate and help us send it back. So, the overall experience was great. Even because we were in a hurry, the store asked us to leave first and paid the room fee via WeChat when we were free. This really shocked me.

It is in a valley and there are all turns. It was foggy when we went there. So we drove up. It felt a bit like walking on the road to hell, and I was almost scared to death. The rooms are not big, and they are all smart homes. For a while, the toilet stopped responding, and for a while, the light in the bathroom couldn't be turned off. It felt flashy and not easy to use. The girl at the front desk provided good service and the breakfast was okay, but the price of more than 1,000 yuan was not worth it and it was not as good as the B&B below. I originally came here for the scenery, but it turned out that the scenery was average. The best scenery was in the village below, and I had to drive down to see it. The first two pictures are the scenery of the village below, and the last picture is the scenery of the hotel. A bit disappointed.

When you pay for the hotel's taxi, they say they don't have a taxi to pick you up. They say they're calling a taxi for you, but they actually just throw it away to you. Let you contact the local driver’s phone number yourself. They are all black cars. They charge 200 for a round trip of about 30 kilometers to Jiuzhaigou Scenic Area. There is nothing to say.

2. The design is a characteristic homestay with 26 rooms, hotel chain management, sanitation and cleaning in place, the room butler and Mr. Wu provide considerate and enthusiastic services
3. Even under the strict three-day and three-quarantine epidemic prevention and control, the hotel has butlers who arrange cars to take you to the nucleic acid point and Jiuzhaigou scenic spots. (ps: I have consulted Conrad and Hilton before departure, and will not be responsible for the three-day nucleic acid test arrangement for the guests, and handle it by myself)
4. The focus is on the authentic Sichuan chefs in Earth Warehouse, which is clean and tastes authentic, which guarantees the taste and hygiene of food when traveling abroad.
5. Looking forward to bringing the baby to experience Jiuzhaigou in winter next time

msg:Newly opened hotel, the environment is very good, the equipment is very smart
Location is near the high-end Hilton hotel group
When you travel to Mizoguchi, the hotel will arrange car transfers
The service staff are very enthusiastic. After the flight returns to the hotel, I can feel the warmth and enthusiasm of the hotel staff
Brother Security is a local *******, and he will be strict in security control
The person was very real, and took me to the second platform above the racecourse and the hotel for a walk. *******s, no matter where they are, are the simplest, true and simple existence, which will make people admire. Simple and happy! ! !

A very good trip, except that Jiuzhaigou Airport is very unreliable, it is very good!

msg:The Treasure Hotel, which just opened on the National Day this year, is inspired by the dear inn. Each small house is shaped like a container, looks exquisite, and has all the necessary living facilities.
My husband and I accidentally chose this shop for our honeymoon. For the first time, two people lived in a deep forest at an altitude of more than 2,500 meters. Face recognition entered, and the experience of the fully intelligent facilities was excellent. Just play music to make the atmosphere full. Evian's water, Dahongpao tea, and baths are all five-star hotel standards... Open the curtains to create an immersive natural environment. It rains just after night and morning, and the distant mountains are floating. The fog and the damp smell of fireworks in the air reminded me of the old house when I was a child. I didn't do anything like this, and I felt beautiful when I stayed quietly.
Before leaving, the manager also gave two movie tickets for Womei Cinemas, which are also a supporting service of the hotel company. The manager said that planning will continue in the future. In the future, you can experience horse racing, driving karts, original traditional ******* meals... a real day It's not enough to enjoy, and I look forward to meeting with a better earth store next time.

msg:I temporarily decided to go to Jiuzhai during the National Day. I saw this newly opened homestay when most of the hotels are full and the room rate increase is exaggerated. Because there is no comment, it is still relatively uneasy. The experience of staying in for three days is still very good. If the location of self-driving is an advantage The Guanyuan Mountain at the Mid-Levels Environmental Platform is very beautiful. The mountain seems to be a homestay and you need to drive down the mountain or order a package at the hotel. There is only a homestay. There is a ****** that is said to be built by the Luneng Group. Currently, various karts and other projects are not charged to buy one. A copy of insurance is very suitable for friends of all sizes. It provides free pick-up and drop-off to the Jiuzhaigou scenic area, which is about ten kilometers. It is much more convenient than driving by yourself, especially in the busy tourist season. I am very enthusiastic and actively help solve any problems with smart devices. The background music in many rooms is also very comfortable. The spare tea, ears, coffee mask and makeup remover are all good brands and highly recommended

msg:I found this hotel occasionally, and it was not long after its opening. Because there was no comment, I was very nervous when I went, but I was looking forward to it. When I arrived, I really felt that the beauty was overturned. On a mountain, the road up the mountain is also a picture of landscapes, cattle and sheep, horses leisurely and leisurely. The hotel has received unanimous praise from the family!
Every employee is warm and friendly, and a ******* uncle started telling us Tashi Delek as far away as possible and helped us carry our luggage. The chef grilled us a delicious barbecue. It’s really happy to have barbecue, drink, and karaoke.
When I wake up in the morning, I feel like I am on the cloud, and the hotel is really good for every part of the hotel. There is also a children’s paradise not far from 100 meters away. It is estimated that Jiuzhai is a rare place for parents and children. The two children should not be too happy.
The hotel’s various facilities are also super smart, and the layout is very warm. A small suggestion is to install a shelf for things in the bathing area, which will be more convenient.
The person in charge of the hotel also said that the facilities are gradually improving, and there will be an infinity pool in the future! Then we will see you next time!
I wish every day to be prosperous!

衞生：和五星級酒店比稍微遜色了一點，衞生間洗漱用品，面膜之類的直接放在洗手池上，感覺有點潮濕，以及衞生紙直接放在浴缸上。建議用專門的容器裝起來呀

早餐稍微簡單了點，建議多一些品種~

地球倉的優點1.首先是高，許多景色是山下魯能區看不到的，感受原生態一定要來一次。2.比國際連鎖酒店更貼近的服務，碰到的所有員工都表現出主動的關心。3.硬件不錯。

缺點：餐飲有點拉胯，上下路的環境有點差，但這是當地牧民的協調問題，可能比較難解決。

總體非常推薦

msg:總結：為了去九寨溝選的酒店，本來看中原生態，去完九寨溝，覺得還不如天天泡在酒店，或者在酒店附近玩～

交通：沒有自駕。送的接機是酒店外包給九寨當地的，司機挺客氣，但喜歡暗示你要每天找他，而且當地司機似乎不能隨便搶生意（因為中途換過司機，他們似乎有點矛盾）。所以最後回程送機找的攜程，也挺好的

環境：沒得説（眼睛看到的比圖更美），非常原生態，適合大都市的人來養心，建議多住幾天🌹聽説附近有看川金絲猴的地方，可以找老闆諮詢。不去九寨溝就在酒店附近玩也不虧！

服務：服務員都很熱情，但人手少，外加當地文化性格，響應速度會比較慢（有個姐姐人特好，可惜忘記名字了）。既然是為了原生態，也不會過於追求五星級管家服務，讓自己的節奏慢下來也挺好！吃飯的時候遇到老闆，聊了好久，老闆很年輕人也很好，有事都可以找他商量，才知道原來這是連鎖酒店。

設施：房間的露台真是舒服極了，外面草坪維護的很好，8月還有很多彩色的小花，白天太陽曬的很熱，晚上山裡很冷，暖氣和空調都有！老闆説以前會斷電，所以房間還備有應急燈！就是房間實在有點小，尤其是衞生間，如果介意的話，需要定好一點的房型，但整體感受可以彌補這個小遺憾吧，畢竟在外面溜達時間更多～

餐飲：可選項很少，主菜有氂牛湯鍋和排骨湯鍋可選，分量很足，還可以點炒菜，但畢竟是山裡，沒那麼多食材。早餐少而精，該有的都有，且廚師燒的不錯，麪條特好吃😋

整體而言，不介意到九寨溝需要開半小時，絕對優質選擇，比山下的連鎖酒店區域（喜來登、康萊德，希爾頓等）位置優越……非常適合悠閑度假！

沒有住過這類地球倉特地來體驗下。位置應該是在魯能後面的山上，前一夜住在英迪格，加了管家微信，第二天安排司機來英迪格免費接送。景色很棒，和一般的酒店住宿感受完全不一樣，住下來覺得還是很值得體驗。前台小姐姐人很好給升級了圓形星空倉拉開窗簾前後都是雪山很美！不過這個房型沒有露台，想在露台坐坐的話還是選基礎房型。因為是淡季所以前面的娛樂公園還沒開，早餐也要過兩天才有，所以免費送了山下英迪格的早餐也很不錯，總體還是挺滿意的，能看出老闆下了血本😂，天氣好的話拍照很美。
PS 提個小建議 能提供個一次性浴缸泡澡袋就更好啦

位置：比較遠，在九寨景區的另外一座山上。開車需要半個小時。
房間環境：很温馨
房間設備：智能馬桶不智能，經常感應不了。廁所小，放紙巾的位置都沒有。淋浴間小，沒有地方放沐浴用品。Wi-Fi弱，12點多後直接上不了。電子門，出現開不了，即使叫工作人員也沒立刻打開。
服務：工作人員比較熱情，但仍需提升標準的專業服務。
早餐，酒店配點早餐很差，衹有小米粥加麪包和雞蛋，牛奶或豆漿都沒有。後面工作人員知道我要喝，主動配了一杯。
其他：房間免費配2瓶依雲水，2瓶後要付費，可以理解此水貴，建議2瓶後可以免提供其他的礦泉水。枕頭很差，而且酒店沒有預備乳膠枕或蕎麥枕，一晚沒睡好。
