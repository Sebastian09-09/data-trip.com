Hotel facilities are great and service was good .  Pay more attention to noise so guests can have a more enjoyable stay .

It was a pleasant stayed just a bit further from our meeting place. I believe they could have been a bit more in touch with us regarding the situation and give us an update of the situation the next morning. We did not hear from them all day and we were hoping to move back but that never happened . We called to find out the situation and we were in stand by until 5pm when they said will call back but that also did not my happened so we called them
Back again. At the end we wer  so tired and we just told them we are not moving and will stay at Conrad hotel.

msg:This is an honest review and we as a family are not hard to please when it comes to hotel services and stays. I rated excellent in “location” because it was very close to locations we intended to go to, but for others who will read this review, I would say close to food shops, grocery, and even shopping center (Solana) 15-17 min walk. So yeah location is great. For service and amenities I put “average” because it was so difficult to get a response with their “magic button” on the phone, they kept hanging us for a long time. The pool was cold, it won’t relaxed your body. Now, this is the most uncomfortable hotel my family and I stayed at, the room was so hot, AC is at 24-26 degrees Celsius but no air Or barely air was coming out from the Aircon panel window. It was terribly hot at night during sleeping hours. We told the front desk about it but they said the hotel turned on the centralized heating and that made the rooms hot, we accepted that reason hoping that in the next few nights the AC would run ok, but it did NOT. Apparently same with other reviews, they can’t do anything about it. So future travelers, you have to take note on this. It was hard to get a good sleep. This is Hilton, they should be able to control this central heating or AC settings to satisfy the comfort of their guests. Of course, at the end of this review the hotel will apologize and will say thank you for the review and they will look into it so that they will keep the standard for future guests. They SHOULD!

Always a trusted group, I always stay at the Hilton no matter where I travel. The staff were excellent and helped with a camcot for the baby and with fruit for the baby at breakfast too.
I just wish traffic wasn't so bad on the way to the hotel and around the nearby attractions. It would have been great to go out now during our stay. Overall peaceful atmosphere, and very tranquil despite being in the city.

msg:We stayed at The Hilton in the middle of the Covid-19 breakout in May 2022, and only for 24 hours, but our stay was more than pleasant. The hotel is near the popular Sanlitun area, and it's about a 5-minute car ride to all major embassies. The rooms in the hotel are small-ish but nevertheless spacious enough for a family of 3 to be comfortable. Also, everything in the room is incredibly clean and tidy and provides a decent stay. Although the hotel restaurants were all closed due to the pandemic, the hotel served breakfast in the room, and there was also an option to have prepared meals brought to your room. The staff was kind enough to provide additional items we needed to care for our daily needs, which were not included in the room. 
Although you would expect things at the Hilton to be extraordinary, it was the staff that made our stay fantastic. They went out and beyond to help with anything that we needed, including assisting with mandatory PCR testing (the testing site is just next to the hotel), airport transportation, arranging taxis, and picking up our deliveries. They were available around the clock and resolved all our questions promptly. We are especially grateful to front desk staff Taylor, Sky, and the young woman at the check-in whose name I unfortunately forgot - they should be commended for their efforts to keep the guests happy and comfortable. 
I would definitely recommend this hotel and would return next time.

It's in the embassy district so there's loads of restaurants and cafes to try out nearby. The hotel room was compact but nice, and everything was sanitized prior to my arrival. It's equipped with a very nice gym. Haven't tried the room service because there were loads of restaurants near by but the menus were pretty standard. The lunch menu seems to be rather limited, but there's enough for breakfast and dinner. Would stay here again.

They have upgraded my room into the executive area of Hilton, Beijing, without additional cost. Thanks a lot for that!

The Gym was very well cleaned and maintained, which is good to know within the actual COVID situation. E.g. only every second cross-trainer was activated to ensure the distance to others.

The breakfast was focused on Chinese and western cuisine, offered in an aesthetic way: Not offered like in a canteen, only small amounts, which are refilled continuously. And very nice to see, that some waiters from 3 years ago are still serving.

In summary, are very enjoyable stay for me and thanks to the Hilton team to make this stay remarkable to me.

I can't open the window, and I can't stretch my head out because of the narrow window. I say I'm afraid of jumping off the building.
There is no ventilation in the bathroom and there is only one bathrobe. You need to ask the front desk for another one.
The mineral water provided by this Hilton is one of the worst in a five-star hotel.

There are more restaurants in this hotel because it is in the embassy district of the CBD, only 500 meters away from the US Embassy. The room facilities are pretty good, very characteristic of Beijing, and every staff member speaks excellent English haha. In addition, special thanks to Miss Wendy Wang for helping to upgrade the breakfast so that customers can have a better experience. The breakfast is also a combination of Chinese and Western, with many varieties, and the coffee is very good. I like the hotel service.

It is said to protect the environment and they don't even provide toiletries. But I just came back from the Hilton in Thailand. It should be there. Everything is pretty good, haha. The most important thing is, don’t forget to bring something with you when you go to stay here. Even a pillow to sleep on. Not even a day later, they said they couldn’t find it. Apart from anything else, I have this pillow. I just bought it and it was under the quilt when I left. They just said that the cleaners didn't see it. Everyone above them was shirking responsibility. They probably lost it privately and didn't dare to admit it. The staff at the afternoon tea at the hotel bar are very good, but others really don't comment on the service. I will not stay at this hotel in Liangmaqiao next time. The service is really not good enough.

Disadvantages 1. The biggest disadvantage is that the bed is too soft and causes back pain when sleeping. It's a flaw if you can't sleep well, no matter how good everything else is, it's useless. 2. The food in the morning is single. After staying for two days, it's just meatballs. 3. The room is not soundproofed.

Then I met the killer ** man who applied for online interviews, and still signed out smoothly in seconds. Looking back, the upgrade to the room I checked in yesterday was a good sign✌.
First, the Hilton Hotel called me the day before check-in to ask if I had any special needs. I was upgraded after check-in, and the service was very warm. Second, the pancakes for breakfast are very down-to-earth, and the elderly in my family like them. Third, the Spring Festival decoration a**osphere is very exciting, not tacky, and feels like going home.
I will stay here again next time. Thank you to the hotel for your concern and consideration.

As soon as I walked into the hotel lobby, the elegant a**osphere and considerate service made me feel the warmth of home. The soft and pleasant background music in the lobby immediately relaxed my nervous nerves.

When checking in, the staff was warm and thoughtful and introduced me to the hotel's facilities and services in detail. They also took the initiative to provide me with travel guides, which gave me a deeper understanding of Beijing.

The room you stayed in was spacious and bright, luxuriously decorated and very stylish. The bed was extremely comfortable and allowed me to get a good rest every night. The facilities in the room are all available, whether it is a work desk, high-speed Internet or a smart TV, I can feel the hotel's attention to detail.

In addition to the comfortable accommodation environment, the catering services at Hilton Beijing Liangmaqiao are also top-notch. The hotel has multiple restaurants and bars, offering a variety of Chinese and Western food and specialty drinks. Whether it was the sumptuous selection at breakfast or the delicacies at dinner, I was thoroughly satisfied.

In addition, the hotel also has a spacious gym and indoor and outdoor swimming pools, allowing me to maintain a healthy lifestyle while traveling. The SPA center provides a variety of massage trea**ents, which helped me relax and soothe myself after being tired.

In terms of geographical location, Hilton Beijing Liangmaqiao is located in the city center with very convenient transportation. It's less than 20 minutes' drive from the airport, making it easy for me to travel to various places. At the same time, there are many famous attractions and shopping malls near the hotel, allowing me to enjoy the charm of Beijing in my spare time.

Overall, Hilton Beijing Liangmaqiao provided me with the ultimate five-star experience. From check-in to departure, the hotel staff showed extremely high professionalism and meticulous care. This is not only a comfortable place to stay, but also an unforgettable travel memory. I have no hesitation in giving this hotel five stars and highly recommend it to other travelers.

msg:The service was poor. I arrived at the hotel very late and had to wait a long time to check in. The price was completely out of proportion to the environment. The breakfast was not as good as before. Originally booked for 2 nights, I canceled one night early and switched to the Kunlun Hotel next door. Environmental services are more than a little better. It just so happened that my Hilton Diamond Card became a regular card after the epidemic, so Hilton said goodbye. In addition, why is the price of each hotel on Ctrip dozens of times more expensive than that on Elong?

I was very tired from the schedule, but the lady took the initiative to help ask my needs: quiet, no worries cigarette. I arranged a satisfactory room. I hope the hotel can have more front desk staff like this lady who not only has a good service attitude, but also pays attention to the needs of the guests. Thank you.

After learning that we were on a birthday tour, they not only upgraded the room type, prepared cakes, but also arranged the room decoration in advance! It was such a surprise when I opened the door.

From the inquiry service before check-in to check-out, the whole process is very silky.

The only unsatisfactory point is that the air conditioner is turned off and it is still very cold. It is a bit doubtful for us to freeze it😿

Thank you to the backstage staff who worked hard for our stay this time. It was a very unforgettable birthday trip. I hope you work well and be happy every day❤️

I contacted the customer service before checking in and told me that there are two children. When I checked in, there were no slippers and toiletries for the children. If I asked for them, a set would be sent to me!
The room was very stuffy. I asked the room attendant who said it was because of the floor heating and asked him to turn down the air conditioner. It turned out to be cold at night without a quilt. It was too hot to sleep with the quilt on. It was also very stuffy during the day, so I had to open the door for ventilation.

Is there no training at the front desk? There are a total of two people at the front desk, none of them are professional!
As a star hotel, poor hardware can be forgiven, but poor software cannot be understood.
I called one day in advance to communicate the check-in requirements, but when I arrived at the hotel, I left a room with a bad location. Ask the front desk to change the room, and reply that it is full of customers and there is no room, let us wait, and wait is fine.
After waiting for an hour to check in again, the front desk said with a smile that there is a room that has not been cleaned, and it will take one hour to clean it, and you need to wait another hour. If you want to check in now, you have to pay to upgrade the room.
It’s okay to add more money, after paying the money, when I got to the room, I found that the location and type of the room were exactly the same as the previous room, the only difference was that this room was upstairs from the previous room! I called the front desk and asked why the room was the same. Didn’t the room type be upgraded with extra money? The front desk said with a smile, this is a high-end deluxe double room. You are so disgusting to me! ! !

msg:Not an unpleasant but definitely unsatisfactory stay experience
First of all, I am very grateful to the lady at the front desk for upgrading the room type for us, but we originally booked a newly renovated room type. After the upgrade, it became an old room type that has not been renovated. The downlight strobe facilities are old, and the air conditioner is still controlled by the old-fashioned knob. The cooling effect is very poor! At that time, when choosing a hotel, I deliberately avoided hotels with older room types that opened earlier. I hope that this kind of operation of upgrading from new to old will not be done in the future.
The second is breakfast. When I booked the room, I saw that the evaluation was above average, but the actual experience was below average. There are too few Chinese dishes! The taste of the fried noodles is very average, and the juice and coffee are good.
In general, if you can sleep normally and have a full breakfast during this stay, it will definitely be no problem, but compared to this price, five-star quality and the Hilton brand, the absolute lack of quality is not satisfactory.

They didn't even tell me when the room was ready. The same thing happened on the day of check-out. Someone pushed the door open and came in. I was checking out on the same day and I didn’t know what the point of cleaning at 9 o’clock was?

Although it is on the second floor next to the third ring road, the sound insulation is very good, there is no noise at all, and the quality of rest is guaranteed. There are not many types of breakfast, but it is fresh enough. All dishes are freshly prepared and replenished in time. I am very satisfied. It is the first choice for business trips in Beijing.

msg:I booked a deluxe executive double bed. The old building where I first lived was a bit cold, and I shivered after taking a shower. The new building that was changed the next day was very warm and I was sweating. Because the price of the changed room was not as expensive as the original one, it was good to give two breakfasts. There are books in the room, as well as the English version of A Dream of Red Mansions, and another one that I forgot the title of the book before reading it, which is also quite good. The breakfast is pretty good. There is a waiter with a seat, and the service is very friendly. The location of the hotel is very good, very close to everything. The swimming pool is at 8:00 am and 8:00 pm. It would be great if it can be at 9.30 am at night. Friends who are afraid of the cold remember to live in the new building. All in all a good experience.

msg:I took the kids out to play during the Spring Festival, because many hotels were full, so I chose the Hilton. The hotel charges for parking, and it should be 100 for a night's stay, but the Ctrip platform is great, and I gave two free parking cards, saving 200 yuan. But the overall evaluation of the hotel is average.
First of all, let's talk about the service. The service is so-so. It has five-star specifications, but there is no five-star service. I took a lot of big bags and small bags by myself, and I could barely take them, but the waiter saw me and said welcome, don't say I am hypocritical, the service industry does not have the vision of the service industry, so I feel that the service is average. It is the general service that all hotels will have.
Besides the room was actually quite clean. There are large windows in the room, so the temperature in the room is always about 20 degrees, and will not exceed 21 degrees. I, a person who likes cold and fears heat, also feel cold. After I told the customer service once and asked them to get an electric heater, the temperature of the room was better. Don't ask me why I don't use air conditioner, because the air conditioner works, but it doesn't work.
Let's talk about it early, so-so, it can only be described as simple.

I said I was in a hurry, but they ignored me at all, with a very bad attitude, and it was not the service of a five-star hotel.

When checking in at the executive lounge, it was said to be 10 o'clock, but it was gone at 8 o'clock, and there were only drinks after 8 o'clock.

I said, can I move in earlier in the afternoon. The other party said that our hotel stipulates that we can only check in at three o'clock in the afternoon. I said, I hope it can be before two o'clock, otherwise can I change the hotel? The other party said, no problem, give me a note. So my follow-up itinerary will be arranged according to this time.
On the day of moving in, when I took the high-speed train to Beijing for half a day and midnight and my stomach was still a little uncomfortable, I arrived at the hotel at 1:55 in the afternoon. The front desk staff said, "We don't have a room, just wait, and move in at 3:00." I said, it was agreed in advance that we will move in at two o'clock, the other party said, but our room is still being cleaned, so you have to wait. I said, then you can let me in the room that is being cleaned, change my clothes and go to the bathroom, but the other party said, no, the room is still being cleaned! I said, don't be so hard-headed, okay? The other party said, no, you have to wait. I said, I don't understand it with you, can you call your leader for coordination, he said, I am the leader. . .

msg:Hilton's room type is very interesting. It has a balcony with a small bevel. The layout of the whole room is very reasonable, giving people a spacious and comfortable feeling. The fly in the oin**ent has 2 points. First, it is too observant of Beijing’s regulations on disposable toiletries. There is nothing in the bathroom (toothbrushes, combs, etc., not at all, not even the boxes of supplies). Compared with other five-star hotels in Beijing, Beijing Hilton has nothing. Not doing well at all. The second is that the reception service at the front desk is not professional enough. The luggage concierge said that he would help with the luggage and disinfect it. As a result, the luggage was placed in an area of the hall after the operation. I don’t know if anyone looked at it, and there was no luggage tag. What should I do if someone took it? Want to see monitoring? When checking in, it is proposed to put the membership number in it, so that the membership number can be automatically associated with subsequent bookings (this time it is known that SNP is not counted). The front desk repeatedly confirmed with me that this is completely unprofessional. Please strengthen the training of interns.

msg:My home is in Beijing, so I have never stayed in a hotel in Beijing. These days, because of home repairs, I have temporarily stayed in a hotel. I chose Hilton, which is closer to home, an old brand, and I have lived in Guangzhou, Shenzhen and other places. I have a good impression, especially the service, which fully meets the five-star standard!

However, I never expected that in the capital of Beijing, Hilton's service is extremely poor! Especially the front desk waiter, she probably doesn't know what industry she is in! Although well-known hotels now require a lot of education for the front desk, any education is not the capital to let you forget your own work, no matter how many languages you know, but the theory that the customer in the service industry is God, you cannot change it!

It seems to me that the quality of the guests who come and go is very high, and most of them are polite and polite when they talk to the waiters. Especially the ones at the front desk are ridiculous! If you feel that you are a corner child, go home and be a young lady and a grandmother, and don't waste time observing the feelings of the people!

In addition, there are water stains on the coffee table in the lobby, no one has wiped it, and it looks like a mess!

msg:The facilities in the administrative building are outdated, the cabinet door actually fell off, and it is close to the third ring road. The room has poor sound insulation and is very noisy, which seriously affects sleep. The hotel's service hotline has a very low response rate. I made 15 calls within half an hour at night and no one answered. I had to go downstairs to the front desk. The actual situation was that three or four people were chatting there. The phone manager on duty the next day apologized and said that he would send breakfast coupons. Unfortunately, I did not have breakfast at the hotel. What the guests wanted was prompt response and service, not breakfast coupons. If the staff is very busy for a short period of time, it is understandable that if they don’t answer the phone for more than half an hour, they can’t justify it. What if it is the emergency assistance of the guests? ! If you can understand in the second half of the night, everyone has to rest, and you can be considerate of missing the phone. The duty manager added WeChat to apologize or something. After a few days, I checked in again, and there were multiple calls and no one answered. I concluded that the service system was indeed a serious problem. This time I learned to be smart and recorded the video of the whole process of calling (including the time information of another mobile phone appeared. In the picture), this time the manager on duty responded very strangely, saying that they had been answering other calls when I was on the phone, I asked why the busy line was not a busy tone, and the reply was that their setting was that there was no busy tone, huh, there is such a thing Phone system, I'm going to ask Hilton headquarters for this reason.

No matter how I measure it, it is only 4 meters wide and 7 meters long, which is about 28 square meters. It is estimated that it can be considered as a building area. The kettle and teapot mentioned in the introduction, I only saw the kettle for boiling water, but no water cups. Hotels like Home Inns are equipped with tea bags and coffee bags, but Hilton does not have them! To be honest, Beijing Hilton is the most outrageous among the many Hilton hotels I have stayed in. It can only be described in two words: awesome.

msg:Very, very, very, very bad. First, the concierge depar**ent of this hotel is just a decoration. You stand and watch you carry your luggage. When I checked in, you made excuses and the concierge depar**ent was busy at 2 pm. No one was there. OK, when I checked out today Woolen cloth? Two people stood there and I told him to check out. He asked me about my information but still didn't take my luggage. So what is the meaning of this depar**ent? The second sanitation is also very average. There is even dust on the bedside table where the phone is placed. It is understandable that your hotel has been old for a long time. If there is dust, it is not a hardware problem. It is because your sanitary conditions are not up to standard, and the indifferent attitude of the cleaning staff reflects The top management of the hotel doesn’t pay much attention to the third thing. I wore a bathrobe and went downstairs to get takeaway at 3:00am last night. Not only did you not have any notices at your door in winter in Beijing, but the attitude of the service staff at the door was extremely bad. I asked him repeatedly if he could go out and help me get the takeaway. When I brought it in, he kept asking me to go by myself as if I couldn’t hear him. When I asked him where it was, he said he would look for it next to the sign. I went out and searched for a long time but couldn’t find it. I asked him again, and he came out and told me where it was. Then why didn’t you go together? Start telling me that I have to find it outside? And you have such a poor service attitude as a hotel employee, making it look like I am the employee and he is the customer? It is very incomprehensible that a five-star hotel needs service, no service, no sanitation, no sanitation, no environment, no environment, you spent money to buy it? The hotel manager was also very speechless. After discovering the problem, instead of giving a solution, she told me that I would ask the reason why the concierge depar**ent didn't carry the luggage at that time. Is this a normal human brain circuit or is your hotel's senior management just like this? . This is the worst hotel I've stayed in so many times, it doesn't deserve the name Hilton and it doesn't deserve 5 stars

msg:In 2021, the Hilton Hotel was selected for the New Year's Eve. He had been planted by Hilton East Third Ring Road before. It was said that Kobe lived in this hotel when he came to Beijing and he finally pulled the ****s this year. First of all, the transportation is convenient. There is a glass dome in the lobby, which looks very transparent. The room has been upgraded to a deluxe room. There is a small TV in the bathroom. You can watch TV when you take a bath. In addition, the night view is really great, you can see the Chinese statue and the big pants, and the car and river at night are also very eye-catching, as if the car is coming towards you, very interesting. Finally, praise summer zhang at the front desk for helping to solve the problem, very good

msg:Worst stay experience ever!
I have stayed at Hiltons all over the country, including foreign countries, many times! From Hilton to its Hamptons and DoubleTrees, there is no one with a better service attitude than this one!
Even if the hotel facilities are old, the service attitude is even worse!

1. Takeaways are not allowed to go upstairs, because of food safety issues. OK, understandable! Put the meal in the hotel lobby, I'm sorry! The food delivery man can only put the meal on a small table diagonally opposite the door and leave it unattended! Wouldn't it be more likely to cause food safety problems if bored people throw dirty things and spit into their meals? Responding to the hotel staff, their feedback throughout the process gives people a feeling of shirk their responsibility! Now food delivery robots are very common, even budget hotels like Atour have them, but Hilton, which is a five-star standard, does not have it! I don't know who gave you the courage to say that you are a five-star hotel. I really don't understand it..

2. Can't connect to wifi. It stands to reason that the wifi in my room should be automatically turned on after opening the room, but it just can't connect! Checked in at 5:00 pm, and until midnight, it was displayed that I had entered the wrong password. There was really no way to call the front desk and said to help me get it done again, and finally it was fixed! The hotel staff said that if I couldn't connect, I should have given them feedback earlier, but I didn't understand it. Shouldn't it be your hotel's own problem! Why didn't I give you feedback sooner!

3. There is no free parking for residents! Parking for one hour 12, euphemistically, there are discounts for users, and the upper limit of one day is 100 yuan! I really thank you! The East Third Ring Road is expensive, and it is understandable to charge appropriately, but I really don’t understand it for users who pay 12 per hour. Is the price different from when I park outside? It stopped for a few hours yesterday, 75 yuan!

4. Because of the unpleasantness in front of me, my attitude is also very tough. Yesterday was my birthday, so I wanted to celebrate with my boyfriend! But because we don't smoke and there is no fire to light candles, my boyfriend went downstairs to get takeout, thinking of asking the front desk for a match by the way. The hotel said there was no match and there was no way to help me with this! At this point I was already burning with anger, rules are dead, people are alive! Borrowing a lighter to light a candle is no good! In a fit of rage, I called the front desk and said that I would light a candle, and you must help me solve this matter. Finally, someone sent a lighter.

In short, the hotel is just like you stay in my hotel, but don't make an accident for me, it doesn't matter if it happens, don't rely on my attitude! And it’s not enough to communicate and discuss with him properly, you have to force you to lose your temper. Once you lose your temper, everything is easy to solve!

The service is remarkable. But I don't understand the unified temperature control of the air conditioner in this winter. It has been maintained at about 20°. I personally think it is relatively cold.

msg:Every year I choose to live in Hilton on holidays. I especially like the big round table office and study in the suite. It is very comfortable. However, this November is really disappointing. I stayed for 4 days and caught mosquitoes for 3 days, and there is not one mosquito. The first day the toilet was shot dead, and the next day the bedside shot dead, I could bear it, but more and more, it seriously affected my life! The first time I went to the front desk without an apology, I just said I sent you a mosquito coil! I changed to a mosquito-repellent coil without sleeping. I found that the mosquito-repellent coil was useless. I went to the front desk again and told me to kill the mosquitoes. Then I went to the so-called executive lounge and waited for two hours. When I was not going down, the service staff came and said that no mosquitoes were found. It seems that I was lying, saying that after spraying you, you can go back and go back to the room. Oh my god, the room is full of pungent cockroach medicine. The mosquitoes are not dead. I was almost dead. I went to the hotel again and said that there was no room to change. I clicked on Ctrip and obviously had the same room to book. Contact customer service again to change the room! It is incomprehensible for such a well-known hotel to deal with the problem so much! I spent 5500 to work overtime to clean, not only did I not clean, but also bit a bag, and caught mosquitoes all night 🦟

After the incident, I asked Ctrip to contact me to solve the problem and put all the blame on the guests. It's really a responsible hotel management company. Since the hotel refuses to solve the problem, then we will compete with each other, and I want to see who will lose the most in the end.

It's just that the pillows are a little short, and the shower head is a little short and there is no overhead. It's a fly in the oin**ent. In addition, parking is quite conscientious, 100 a day, unlimited number of times of entry and exit.

msg:The hotels in Beijing are always different from other places, but they can also experience the unique taste. The rooms are not spacious and luxurious, but they can't fault it. The swimming pool is not big, you need to go up the stairs, you can see the sweaty young women consuming extra energy to their heart's content. The breakfast is divided into two areas, the central and western areas, which reflects the current international society's trend. The breakfast variety guarantees that you will not be hungry, which fully reflects the requirement of opposing waste. In the restaurant, young couples who had just finished morning exercises were listless, and the Slavic family who had given birth to three children ate bread calmly. It was a great experience.

To be honest, I also want to eat directly at the hotel, but there are not many choices for ordering in the room, and then it is sweet, the noodles are also sweet, the meat is also sweet, and there is too much sugar...It's really not tasty...The smoked salmon on the first floor is OK Song is very delicious! You have to buy it yourself...not on the menu. The pool can't be ordered and it's depressing.

msg:The overall evaluation is not bad. First of all, the traffic and location are not far away. It is less than half an hour's drive from the South Railway Station, Forbidden City, and Xinjiekou Deyun Club (taxi is better than expected). In addition, 7-8 hundred meters away from the hotel is the Xiaoyun Road Food Street. There are all kinds of cuisines, and I randomly picked three (Beijing, Sichuan, and Korean). They are all very good. The hotel is well managed, and when you walk in directly, a staff member will come forward and ask if there is a room card or something. Let’s talk about the room environment~ I ordered a deluxe bed from Ctrip. My husband was told that it was upgraded (surprise) when I checked in. The upgraded room is on the 24th floor of the new building (I don’t know whether the original room is in the new building or not. The old building), the night view is good (I don’t know if every double bed room has floor-to-ceiling windows), the room is quite big, and the toilet is a smart toilet. The twin room on the floor, (no comparison, no harm). The twin room in the old building is smaller than the big bed in the new building, but the bathroom is very large. The hotel’s breakfast buffet is similar to most hotels, and the beef noodles are not bad. Having said that, there is no picture, and I forgot to take it. . .

msg:真後悔沒有選擇隔壁的威斯汀，對希爾頓的服務、硬件設施也徹底寒了心～
訂的行政房間，套餐裏含入住當晚的簡餐，我想如果有三明治，沙拉🥗，可以在閉餐前幫我打包一份放到冷藏櫃，等我抵達後起碼可以充充饑。工作人員的解釋，首先不能打包，因為是熱菜，沒有條件儲存，我説我衹需要沙拉和三明治，其回覆是不知道我喜歡什麼口味，所以很抱歉！無語，一開始電話裏詢問我的個人訊息，問我是不是在攜程定的，最後又咄咄逼人説不能滿足，一開始的鋪墊純屬畫蛇添足嘛，形式化主義！
到了酒店，前台就一個人，正在給一名外籍顧客辦理入住，不曉得是業務不熟練還是怎麼滴，足足等了20分鐘。期間在我後面排隊的一個女生，也是外籍，見前台又出來一個接待，馬上快步向前，插隊到我前面，工作人員完全無視，且區別對待顯而易見！
辦理好了回房間，找客房服務要數據線充電，哪知usb接口通通都是擺設，一個也不能用。我還以為數據電源線有故障，換了一根還是不行，工作人員説，蘋果手機不支持！我心想，這都什麼年代了～這幾年，第一次遇到～
洗漱的時候發現沒有洗漱用品，再打電話，始終無人接聽！打了好幾次，真的服了！當天晚上明知道滿房，為何不做出提高效率的措施呢？總之，體驗差！太差了！從此拉黑！

我出去拿個外賣穿睡袍穿拖鞋出去取 禮賓部説：拖鞋是私人物品不能穿出來 但是你怎麼知道我回房間是脱了鞋還是光腳？意思是我在你們這種酒店還要幫助你們維護你們的體面？我的奶也是私人物品你們前台和禮賓部也沒少看啊

感覺這個酒店壓根兒就不是為了賺錢 像某個政府的部門 我作為酒店住客 不要説該有的5星級服務 連正常的權利都不能擁有

msg:首先，我入住酒店，辦理入住大概用了40分鐘時間，前面就一位客人，這個效率真的不是很舒適。
在我入住時，房間的電話是壞掉的，無法通過快捷服務健接通工作人員。
等到我從酒店退房時，10月1日上午的那一位女士（前台工作人員）説話語氣真的拉低了五星級酒店的素質。
退按金時，她對我説：都給了您整的，反正她們也不差那一毛錢，2022年了，我試問誰還差那1毛錢，這種語氣是正常談話的態度嗎？非常差的一次入住體驗！這真的是北京5星級酒店的服務水準嗎？

msg:《關於我在北京當怨種之花九百塊錢住連鎖便捷酒店的這件事》
九百塊雖然談不上有多貴昂，但至少也是能是個能住星級酒店的價格了，我也知道自己還住不起寶格麗，人生路任重而道遠。就先從門口給大家細細道來這個酒店的真實體驗吧。
1、門口的迎賓像個*****，我站門口旁邊抽煙呢，他*****走過來用一口流利的東北話問我，你是住店的沒？ 純純把我整無語了
2、入住酒店之後，打開房間門我傻眼了，浴室極其侷促，甚至沒有排風，打着環保的旗號做着摳門的事兒，什麼浴帽、什麼棉簽、那不存在的。大家看看這個阿妹牌牙膏就知道了。
第一天晚上衹給我兩瓶水，第二天給我放了八瓶，我不理解。
3、外賣還不但不能讓前台人員送上來，還不讓外賣小哥放在前台，沒有外賣前台，就是要外賣小哥必須站在門口站着拎着等，直到客人親自下去取上來。也沒別的，純粹希望顧客別老躺着，起來動動身體活動筋骨罷了，酒店又能有什麼錯呢？在顧客物品提供服務上，那跟環保少女格雷塔一樣的做派，在這時候又毫無人性了。呵呵

msg:The service was pretty good, and the young man at the front desk in the middle of the night helped me deal with the urgently needed scanned documents. What is outrageous is that 165 parking fees (24 hours) were charged as a resident guest in the underground parking lot of the Hilton Hotel parking lot. There are no other businesses in that building, it's really weird!
