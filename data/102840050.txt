msg:New hotel, as expected you have nothing to worry about the cleanliness of the hotel and service rendered by the staffs. But Ray, the night shift manager according to the front counter has been doing more than excellent level. The night before checking in, I called to ask for transfer service from train station to hotel but unfortunately service is unavailable to/from train station. Ray offered his personal service to meet us at the train station and grab an e hailing cab for us, and all these were done out of his shift hour. I'm truly appreciating his initiative and efforts in making sure our journey was smooth and comfortable. I think it's Ascott group's fortune to have such a dedicated staff working for the property.

It's a brand new apartment, all the appliances are international branded like Siemens, Toto, Electrolux, Huawei... They have Nescafe coffee machine with good Nescafe coffee capsules. They have indoor Air quality monitoring. Breakfast was great, as a vegetarian there was plenty options and every day there was different variety. The coffee is worth to try. The swimming pool and gym has a good view. I enjoyed every bit of it. Respectful and supportive staff. Location wise, it's a walkable distance to beach and closer to local amenities. Perfect for a family trip.Tip: Ask for Building 1 as you will get nice ocean and mountain view.

msg:I haven't been to Sanya for many years. There are many resort hotels in Sanya. For the quality of the holiday, I booked this one on Ctrip.com, because most of the hotels in Sanya are non-cancellable, and I was very entangled. It feels like a bet. Unexpectedly, I was surprised when I arrived. I sighed that I was lucky! The hotel is located near Dadonghai, quiet in the bustling city. Although it is a second-line landscape, it does not affect the view. The balcony can directly shoot a large sunrise sea view. The hotel facilities are novel and complete, the room design is good and large, clean, tidy, comfortable and sanitary, the underground garage is reasonably configured, the access management of the three hotel apar**ent areas is rigorous and considerate, and the lobby area passage gate is fully intelligent. There are several small Internet celebrity spots in the community that are very beautiful, and those who like to take pictures can enjoy it. Breakfast time is 7-11 o'clock, humanized. Sleep until you wake up naturally, on the large balcony, smell the sea breeze, face the sea, practice yoga, have a rich buffet breakfast in the hotel after exercise, and then walk 6 minutes to Dadonghai for a stroll, watching people play in the sea or stepping on the waves by yourself, it's very pleasant! When I was tired, I sat under the coconut trees next to the long row of various restaurants, bars, and coffee shops on the beach. I enjoyed the sunshine through the coconut trees with a drink, and the taste of slow life came out. After dinner, I swam in the hotel's private swimming pool for a while under the moonlight, and the beauty filled my heart. I stayed for four consecutive days and did not waste the "May Day" holiday. The hotel is 2.1 kilometers away from the Luhuitou Scenic Area, and the sunset and the night view of Haihua Island are the most beautiful. It is 2 kilometers away from the Banshan Peninsula Sailing Base. It is also a good experience to rent a yacht to go out to sea. Such a perfect holiday, I need to thank the housekeeper Xiao Xu for his help! Thank you Ctrip! I hope my evaluation can help those who want to come to Sanya for vacation.

It exudes luxury from inside to outside, which is much better than a group of five-star hotels that cost thousands of yuan a night. The price-performance ratio is very high. I will choose Ascott again when I come to Sanya in the future. Special thanks to the front desk lady Jessica

The facilities are first-class, in line with Ascott's usual standards, and even better than in other cities. The housekeeper Lucy and the hotel partners provide very professional, thoughtful and meticulous services. The breakfast is diverse. I recommend the Baoluo noodles, which you must eat a bowl every day. There are also fruits and vegetables, which are super fresh, sweet and delicious. The most praiseworthy thing is the insect removal. In fact, the hotel is backed by mountains, and there should be more mosquitoes than on the beach. I saw insects, but I was not bitten. The immersive feeling and supporting shops of Kabi Town are also well built. I found a lot of fun and check-in places when I walked and stopped. I will definitely come again next time!

In addition to eating the special Baoluo noodles, fried ice, coconut chicken, and dregs vinegar, we went to Wanghao and Hema to buy seafood and cook the rest. The breakfast category is quite rich and the taste is OK. The swimming pool and other public areas are relatively clean. Although the public area is small, you can go to Marriott and Autograph.

Dadonghai is convenient to the city, and the sand on the beach is relatively fine (Yalong Bay is very co**** and hurts your feet), and there are not many people.

Service: There is a butler service, and the cleaning is OK

It is only 500m walk from Dadonghai near Luhuitou, Sanya, about 5 kilometers from the city, and only 20 kilometers from the high-speed rail station and the airport. The transportation is very convenient! Although it is an apar**ent, it is the first resort-style serviced apar**ent under Ascott. Not only can you experience the warmth, privacy and comfort of "going home", but you can also feel the unique fireworks from this island! The apar**ent is also equipped with a restaurant, park, infinity pool, gym, bar, conference room and children's playground! !
Each room has its own kitchen and refrigerator... You can also buy seafood and cook it! How can you not love it?
I especially recommend Mr. Reece at the front desk, the service is very attentive and thoughtful!

msg:❣️Location:
It was my first time to stay at Ascott Shanhaitian. It was located in the Dadonghai Scenic Area of ​​Sanya, with convenient transportation and surrounded by many special snack streets, attractions and shopping malls. Whether you are going to the beach or the city, it is very convenient.
🏨Facilities:
This time I stayed in a one-bedroom suite. The room was very large. The kitchen was fully equipped with cooking utensils. The most surprising thing was that it had a dishwasher and an all-in-one washing and drying machine. It was a blessing for lazy people! ! What is particularly worth mentioning is the terrace, where you can see the sea view from the door.

🌿Environment: A worthwhile check-in point - Kirby Town. Collect six Kirby Bear cards and you can exchange them for small gifts. Check in and take photos📸Another movie is out. Complementing the overall architectural style of the apar**ent, the swimming pool is surrounded by tropical plants and green trees, creating a peaceful and comfortable environment. The water quality of the swimming pool is clear and transparent, and people can feel its cleanliness and hygiene at a glance.

Service: Finally, the staff are very warm and friendly, especially Ursa, who will take the initiative to say hello. Recommended! Will come back and stay again

She also told me that when I check out, I can call the front desk to put my room card in my room and go directly to the underground parking lot to drive out of the hotel. Excellent service! This is a very satisfying stay experience. The location is also very convenient. It is very convenient for shopping in the city. It gives me a feeling of home!

I decided not to change after staying in this one!!
I will definitely come again next time

🧺Facilities and services: The apar**ent is very convenient, with a lot of boxes and cabinets. Breakfast is really recommended.
🛋Layout/room type: I wanted to make the elderly and children more comfortable, so I upgraded the room type. I highly recommend it~
Service: Mr. Liu, the front desk manager of the hotel (I can’t remember, I guess), is very responsible and has good reviews. Every time I pass by, he is either working hard or teaching employees. It is really important to meet good leaders.
Overall: The price/performance ratio is extremely high. If you need permanent residence or multiple rooms, this is the best choice.

msg:This time I booked three nights, staying in an executive single room for 2 nights and a two-bedroom suite for 1 night. Ascott's location, facilities, environment, and hygiene are all top-notch, and I love them as always. However, I was a little disappointed with the service. Although I called the housekeeper in advance to ask the housekeeper to add me, it was not the same housekeeper. Whoever is on duty uses this WeChat ID (I don’t know if this is a regulation here).
Three questions:
1. The service response is too slow: I asked for a pair of scissors, but after urging for a long time, they were not delivered. It was said that there were too few people in the housekeeping depar**ent. This is understandable, but staffing may need to be put on the agenda.
2. The doorman was so unprofessional. There was a fat boy with acne on his face. I asked where the nearest supermarket was, but he said he didn’t know and continued to play on his mobile phone.
2. What makes me more angry is that we have to change from an executive single room to a family room after the second night. Because we are traveling with three people, we need three beds. I have to confirm this with the hotel again after I place the order, because The number of beds you can choose for this room type depends on the hotel conditions, but the front desk told me to confirm it for me soon, but it was never confirmed. When I asked the front desk the night before check-in, I still couldn't confirm how many beds there were. They said there were three. If so, we will give priority, but we are not sure whether the original guest will continue to stay.

Later, when the front desk saw that we were really angry, they began to comfort us. The manager was very kind and upgraded us to a room. If we needed anything later, he was very prompt in responding to us. Although one of the rooms was empty of shower gel and conditioner. No..
What I want to say is that if the response speed was like this, I would give the service 5 points, but it is not necessary to make up for it after the customer gets angry...

I hope Ascott Sanya can improve its service, because the rooms, views, and room types of Ascott are all my favorites. If the service improves, I will choose Ascott again next time I come to Sanya.

msg:I stayed in a room that cost more than 6,000 a night for 10 days. There was a problem with the bicycle brake. It was not sensitive and broke. My friend was riding a bicycle in the hotel and could not brake the bicycle and fell. His leg was bruised. It was distressing to see it. The security guard at the time Everyone who saw it said there was something wrong with the bicycle's handbrake. After the fall, I took my friend to the hospital immediately. I told the manager that I wanted to refund the medical expenses and the room charges. The manager said that the room charges were not acceptable, but the medical expenses were not necessarily. I was shocked. The total medical expenses were not 80 yuan. He told me that the medical expenses may not be reimbursed. I need to check with the insurance company. , they said they would send me a responsibility division form and a claim form. I asked the manager when they would be able to give it to me, but the manager said not necessarily and that he could not tell me the exact time. I asked the manager if it would be OK today, but the manager said not necessarily. His attitude was very tough. He also said not to talk to me or my relatives, but to talk to the injured person. If you are so seriously injured, don’t you need to rest when you come back? This friend will leave tomorrow. How can we talk? Send a WeChat message every time It took about 20 minutes to reply to me a few words. How could I not be angry? There was a problem with work efficiency and service attitude. After I came back from the trip, I thought to myself, I went out to have a good time, the medical expenses are not much, and the room fee does not need to be refunded. I told others that I came back to the lobby to see the manager on duty. The manager on duty asked me what I needed to do, and I said no. There is no need for compensation, medical expenses, lost work expenses, hotel expenses, or mental damages. I want you to apologize. It has been about 6 hours since this incident happened, and I haven’t even given a serious apology. I want you to apologize for not checking the bicycle properly and for having a bad attitude. The manager on duty is called Wang Zuhe. Wang Zuhe told us that apologizing is not possible. It is the first time I have seen such a service attitude. A customer had an accident in the hotel because the handbrake of the bicycle was not checked. , without a word of apology, he insisted that there was nothing wrong with the car, and said that if he needs to confront the security guard, he said that he could confront the security guard. The security guard is your staff and will definitely listen to you. Is confrontation useful? Asked me how to solve the problem, I said to apologize, and then told me that apologizing would not work. Why should Wang Zuhe be the duty manager if he is so stubborn? Isn't this the big brother? I sincerely advise everyone not to come to this hotel. The service is really problematic. I didn’t give a bad review for all the things that happened before. I just want to see how I am apologetic. This manager on duty really annoys me. Please don’t stay here. hotel! ! ! Don't stay! ! ! If something happens, in this hotel, we can only admit defeat? I have stayed in many hotels, and this is the first time I have seen such a bad one.

He is very considerate and the butler Dalin basically meets all the needs he asked. The experience is very good. Then when I opened the door and looked through the balcony, I was facing the sea. My dad was so satisfied. He slept in the room every day until he woke up naturally, made a leisurely breakfast for himself, and then walked to the beach in 3-5 minutes and sat there. Reading books and playing with mobile phones in a daze, if you don’t want to go out, the scenery on the balcony is also great. The whole experience this time was amazing.

During the subsequent stay at the hotel, Lucy was also very enthusiastic and responded quickly. Thank you very much. The hotel is very new. The only drawback is that the cabinets still smell.

Service: Before check-in, a dedicated person called to inquire about the check-in time and added WeChat. They were very considerate. After check-out, they offered to upgrade the room next time they stayed. Like it~

Need to be improved: It took three calls to deliver the hair dryer at night, which was a bit delayed. In addition, this hotel requires a deposit even if the room rate is prepaid, which is a bit rare.

Coffee capsules were given after asking, and the original NESPRESSO was replaced with lor! The complimentary mini bar in the room was empty. After asking, I was told that it was no longer available.

msg:It’s been less than a month since the last five-star review, so I’ll give it a four-star rating this time~

The overall experience this time was not as good as before, because Ascott suddenly became popular. On the one hand, I am happy for the hotel. From the initial opening to the hotel where everything was not perfect enough to stay, it has become an Internet celebrity hotel. Good quality is worthy of everyone's choice, but On the other hand, Ren Yiduo has a relatively poor experience as a consumer. On the first day I checked in, I had to wait until three o'clock to check in. Because the room was full, the cleaning of the room after check-out was slow. The room type on the first day was also very confusing. There was a mirror opposite the bathroom. My parents bumped into the mirror every time they went to the bathroom until I I also decided to change rooms after bumping into a mirror. It is recommended to remove the mirror or change the direction. During the breakfast peak, when the restaurant is crowded, put two pictures to get a feel for it... After adjusting the room type, it seems that people in the restaurant are better off eating during the off-peak hours. . Overall, this hotel has a good value for money, but now that it has become an internet celebrity hotel, there are many people who need to consider it😃

Since this trip was with both elderly people, the front desk said on the first day The supply of housing was tight, so we arranged for the elderly to live in different housing types and floors. The next day, with the coordination of manager Mandy, we were able to switch to a room that we were satisfied with, and then we were thoughtfully provided with a late check-out. Generally speaking, the hotel management is standardized, the room facilities are complete and the quality control is good, the staff are polite and orderly, and the breakfast quality is also very good. I hope the hotel can maintain high service standards and will continue to patronize next time!

It has a kitchen, a washing machine and other household facilities. This time we chose the sea view. A light luxury suite with two bedrooms, one living room and two bathrooms. There are also many closets and storage spaces. It has a large space, nearly 150 square meters. It faces the sea and has a great view. The service staff are very good and enthusiastic. They need to be improved. The point is that there are no special service arrangements for children. For example, in our last hotel, we arranged exclusive items such as children's toiletries, bathrobes and slippers, as well as toys for children. I hope Ascott will provide more services to family guests in the future. Can have more detailed services❤️❤️❤️

The location is very good. It is close to Dadonghai. It is a relatively mature area. It is very convenient to go out to eat and go to the beach. It is also very close to Xiaodonghai. It is great to catch the sea!
The room conditions are perfect for staying in a serviced apar**ent on the beach. There is a washing machine with drying function, a microwave, and a refrigerator. It should not be too fragrant. After playing at the beach and rushing back to the beach, it is so worry-free to wash the wet clothes and dry them directly!
The hotel service is also very good. They will take our requests seriously. All the staff are very friendly and warm ~
In addition, the hotel is quite parent-child friendly, with a very new playground and a sandy area outside where children can dig sand to their heart's content. Great!

We were lucky enough to get a free upgrade to a sea view suite, which was not only almost twice the size, but also came with a full set of kitchen appliances, tableware, a coffee machine and a washer and dryer. The hotel hardware is good, and the public parts also include swimming pools, gyms, children's playgrounds, etc. The greenery is neatly trimmed and soft music can be heard. It is suitable for living and has good privacy. The lobby is on the third floor. Breakfast is a combination of Chinese and Western cuisine, and the room voucher also includes a Southeast Asian-style lunch set menu. Laksa is a must-try, and the rich soup will transport you to Southeast Asia in one second. The service staff are also very enthusiastic. You can easily reach major attractions by taking a taxi or taking public transportation.

msg:I had a great time staying in Sanya for four days. I booked a package with Ctrip.
¥1399 two-night package*2, deluxe executive sea view suite + double breakfast + lunch, newly opened in 2023, first-class sea view, great breakfast, lunch is spicy but delicious, exquisite decoration, high-end appliances, kitchen and bathtub, very good service, First-class management team, the front desk is very nice. We only made an appoin**ent for two nights at the beginning. We planned to go out and didn't have time for lunch. With my parents and three adults, we had to have an extra breakfast, so I wanted to replace lunch with breakfast for two days and help me. We communicated well. There are very few people in the small children's paradise. The children go to the reserved area every day. The swimming pool is also good. Unfortunately, it is a bit cold on a cloudy day. I quickly went to play in the morning when there was sunshine. The nearby Dadonghailu is also convenient for turning around. It is very suitable. If you drive by yourself, it’s 0.5 minutes to go to Yalong Bay and 1 hour to Haitang Bay. I bought seafood at the nearby Wanghao Supermarket and cooked it myself. Later, I ate it once at Wanghao Restaurant and felt it was much more cost-effective to buy it back.

All in one, high-end kitchen appliances, enthusiastic attitude of service staff, and sumptuous breakfast, the infinity pool is very photogenic.

The room was very clean, and the small packet of toilet paper that was placed on the table was found to be neatly arranged when I came back 😂
The room is very spacious, and the bedroom and living room have balconies where you can see the beach and the sunrise. There is also a large refrigerator, kitchen and washing machine, which is very convenient.
It is suitable for family travel, sisters, and couples.

The location of the hotel is also very convenient. During the few days of travel, I used shared bicycles to go out to eat. It is not far away and can maintain the tranquility of the mountains and rivers. You can also reserve a shuttle bus to the duty-free shop for free at the hotel entrance. It takes less than 10 minutes to walk to the beach.

Although the swimming pool is not very big, it is very clean, and the restaurant meals are also good, although the location is not very sufficient even during vacation.

It is worth mentioning that after checking out, I also left a review on Ascott's official website, which mentioned some shortcomings. Someone quickly called and informed them of future solutions, etc., which made people feel that the service was really good. Very good, they attach great importance to guests' feelings and feedback.

msg:Let me objectively evaluate this hotel. I have just stayed at the Sun Bay Park Hyatt and the St. Regis. In comparison, it is not suitable for a vacation. There are no public areas. It is suitable for driving out and playing outside the hotel during the day. Of course, the price is not in the same range. I can only say that it is cost-effective. It is indeed quite high; but what makes me most angry is: the flight was canceled on the last day, and I asked the front desk if I could extend my stay. The front desk told me to reply in half an hour, but there was no reply. Because I was in a hurry to have breakfast, I took the initiative to call the front desk. She said she was busy, so she didn't call me to tell me that I couldn't extend my stay because there was no room type like mine that day, and the price had increased a lot that day (the price was only high on that day, and then fell back the next day). She communicated with me about the delayed check-out and told me A little later; I was so angry that I called the front desk and expressed my dissatisfaction. The front desk manager later gave an explanation and said that you can stay in the original room if you book any room type. However, the room price was very high only on that day, and it fell back the next day. (It’s not that I can’t afford it, it’s because Ascott doesn’t deserve the price. I stayed at the Park Hyatt for several thousand dollars for 4 nights and the St. Regis for 3 nights). I thought I’d just change my ticket and go back. The most amazing scene was, I suddenly found a fairly reliable price on Ctrip and Qunar. I immediately consulted the manager. The manager said that if the reservation is successful, you can extend your stay. As a result, I booked it immediately, and then contacted the airline to change the reservation. After changing the booking, I suddenly found that my order was not successfully booked! The reason was that the hotel rejected it! That night, I checked again out of boredom, the room type was released again, and the hotel room rate became normal again... Dear manager, if you don’t want to let If I live here, I don’t have to pretend to be a gentleman. I personally rejected my order and changed my flight. However, the room was not sold at night. Ascott’s life is in trouble.

Service: The restaurant waiter is very warm and greets you

Environment: The sea view is shown in the picture, and you can watch the sunrise. But there is a fence on the beach across the road. I don’t know how to repair it. There are rocks on the ground. When we went there, adults and children stepped on the sand, fell down, and bruised their arms.
The waiter gave me a band-aid. Thank you.

The front desk immediately gave him a coin to transfer to the blind box. The child drew a duck and stopped crying immediately. Later, check-out was delayed until 2 pm, which was very user-friendly. We live on the 9th floor of Building 3. Every time we need something, the waiters are sweating profusely, which makes us very embarrassed. The restaurant staff are also very enthusiastic, clearing away empty plates quickly and with a good attitude. The lady in the playroom is also very nice and will play with the children. In short, I can feel that all the staff are enthusiastic from the heart, without any perfunctory, and the whole team is like a big family. Besides, the hardware facilities are very good. The best sea view is in Building 3. We live on the 9th floor and the view is very good. The key is that you can go to the sea and collect shells just across the road from the hotel🐚, which is really great. The food in the restaurant is also very good. The Southeast Asian cuisine is very appetizing and not expensive. The price/performance ratio is very high in Sanya and it is worth a try. We will definitely come back in the future.

I have stayed at Somerset and Ascott many times and I think they are so delicious.

The hotel is newly opened, the facilities are very new, and the kitchen and washing machine are fully equipped. The toilet is also Toto, and you can directly see the sea from the balcony of the living room and bedroom, which is really refreshing.

The staff are also very nice. I couldn't understand the microwave, so I asked someone to check it out, but I forgot to turn on the switch, haha.

The daily hygiene is also very good. The eldest sister cleans the house cleanly and neatly. I am very satisfied with this standard.

The restaurant doesn't close until eleven o'clock, so for a lazy person like me, eating two meals a day is enough. There aren't many breakfast varieties, but it's enough for me. Donuts, coffee, Bao Luo powder, soy milk fried dough sticks, chicken steak, fried eggs, very good.

The service staff were polite and looked happy. I feel better.

The hotel is about ten minutes' walk from the bathing beach. The hotel also has a swimming pool, which is very convenient. It is also very quiet at night, and I have slept well these days. The service apar**ents are larger than ordinary hotel rooms, and you can also cook some simple meals yourself, which is very cost-effective.

I will stay here again next time I come.

Every room and even the bathroom can see the sea view. I liked it and extended my stay for another three days without hesitation. For two days and two nights, it felt like I was at home in Hainan. This is an experience that cannot be given by staying in a hotel...
The breakfast tastes good, especially the seafood porridge, which a certain woman will never forget...
On the day I checked in, I couldn’t wait to recommend it to several friends.
Next time I come to Sanya, I will definitely stay here again. If I have the chance, try Room 02 on the high floor, it is the best.

Although it didn't have a first-line sea view, it was quite comfortable. I guess if it is on the second or third floor, you can see the hotel's own swimming pool up close, and it would be nice to see more handsome guys and beauties to entertain your eyes. The hygienic condition of the room is good. One obvious aspect is that there is no water stain on the surface of the bathroom hardware, which is a genuine five-star standard. The room has its own kitchen with basic kitchen utensils. There is a dining table next to the stove. You can buy some seafood from the market and cook it yourself, steam and boil it, which is comfortable and convenient. I regret that I cooked seafood in Wanning before. I really should put it here. I have pictures of my own infinity pool for everyone to see for themselves.

Environment: very comfortable holiday apar**ent style, close to the seaside of Dadonghai, 5 minutes walk to the beach with reefs, 10 minutes walk to the beach, and only 10 minutes walk to the restaurant street

Service: Very considerate. There was a problem with the screen projection in the room and it was solved immediately. It was very good.

msg:It is a newly opened hotel apar**ent. The room is large in size and has a washer and dryer. The waiter also helped to upgrade the room for free. The upgraded sea view room can face the sea directly. It takes 5-10 minutes to walk from the sea. The hotel swimming pool is also large and suitable for children. I play in the swimming pool every day, but the price of children's breakfast is a bit high. Generally speaking, I will choose Ascott next time. All the staff I interact with are smiling, polite, and very patient. Next time I go to Sanya I still book your home😁😁😁

msg:The decoration of the room is tasteful, the view is not good, and the sanitation is generally not much to say. You know what’s the most interesting thing? When I checked out, I reported the smell problem to the front desk, and she actually told me that no one else had complained about it. Her ability to tell lies while wearing glasses in broad daylight was top-notch. Then I said that the first and second buildings were less tasteful, and that the third building was opened later. The front desk told me that they were opened together, which is simply a liar. The Ascott brand has always been good in my heart, and this store also has some bright spots, but you should be cautious about such a hotel with a big taste and lying services.

msg:How should I put it? I never give neutral or negative reviews, but this hotel made me feel that the experience this time was not good at all. First, I drove to the door, and after getting off, the two of us took the wheelchair with us. Elderly, we still have to drag two big boxes. There is no doorman at the door to help us take our luggage to the lobby. You know, we have to take the elevator up to the first floor from the door to the lobby. After checking in, there is no one to help us take our luggage. As for the room, the lobby and the room are in two buildings, which are quite far apart. Is this the service that a so-called five-star hotel should have? In addition, for breakfast, I stayed from the 9th to check out on the 14th. The breakfast varieties were only the third one, which was not in line with the value of the hotel price. As for the service, I didn’t experience it at all. The experience was very poor. In short, I won’t come again. I don’t recommend it!

The hotel is newly opened, with the same Ascott quality as before, the facilities are very new, well-equipped, and it feels like a comfortable vacation.
The hotel swimming pool is very clean, there are not many people, and there are matching bathrooms available.
The hotel restaurant is not big, and there are not many varieties of breakfast, but it can be full.
As a newly opened hotel, the management still needs to be further adjusted and optimized. There was a small misunderstanding when we left the hotel, but the front desk quickly communicated and resolved it clearly.
Overall, I am very satisfied. This time I only stayed for two nights because I was going to Lingshui. The first choice for vacation in Sanya in the future.

After it was done, I asked if I could help take it to the room. I was told that I had to go by myself. Our whole family, packed with luggage, searched all the way to Building 3. We booked a two-bedroom sea view room, 3129, and when we arrived, we only saw There was a room number 3129, but the door was still open. When I went in, it was written 3124, 3125 but not 3129. I searched around but couldn't find the room. After calling to ask, I was told that these two rooms were 3129. When I checked in Why don't you say it? And these two rooms cannot be connected.

Hygiene: The newly renovated hotel feels very clean. The decoration style is modern and simple. It still smells good when you check in at the end of July. It will be better if you turn off the air conditioner.

Environment: near the beach, building 1 has a better view

Service: The service awareness needs to be improved. The hotel seems to have insufficient service staff, and the cleaning is very slow. It may be newly opened, and the employees themselves need to familiarize themselves with the hotel environment.

Relatively quiet, with a kitchen, suitable for family outings.

It was my first trip to Sanya, and I was in a hurry, and the tickets paid by the hotel were not used. The whole environment is very good, but the sound insulation in the living room is a little bit poor, or it may be that the sound next door is too loud 😂
In short, I am very satisfied, and I will still choose the hotel next time.

Disappointed the second time
First of all, the level of slippers has dropped seriously
Secondly, the hygiene is hard to describe: the sofa seat cushions have a serious sweat smell; when I went to the toilet, I found urine stains on the toilet seat (because I was in a hurry to go to the toilet and disinfected with the self-contained disinfection towel and did not have time to take pictures);
And the pillows are too high for comfort.

The twin room is really small, and there is nothing in the kitchen.


The breakfast was good and tasty. Parking is also good.
Finally, post a beautiful photo of the slippers I used to live in Ascott for comparison.

After checking in, I found the room was really small. The breakfast is very rich, and the bak kut teh for lunch is really not used to it😂 Overall it is a good choice.
Supplement: I checked in on the 17th, saying that the swimming pool was closed due to a typhoon, but in fact there was no rain during the day, only a breeze. The children were disappointed because the swimming pool was closed and the glass boat could not be used.

Environment: I like the environment of Shanhaitian very much. It occupies a corner of Dadonghai, quiet and lively.
The only disturbing thing about this stay is that there is a new hotel next door under renovation, facing the 3rd building. Construction started at 6 o'clock in the morning, which was very noisy. Although the hotel said that it has complained to the construction party, it will still reduce the goodwill of staying.

It's very convenient to come here by car. It's also very close to Dadonghai on foot. The breakfast is not bad!
It's a newly opened hotel, the room still smells bad, it's much better if the doors and windows are seamed when you sleep, but the air conditioner is very powerful!
Overall it is worth staying!

msg:This is my first trip to Sanya. Considering that there are old people and children, serviced apar**ents have always been our first choice for traveling. We booked the Ascott in Dadonghai on Ctrip. When we arrived at the hotel lobby at night, the front desk quickly checked in for us. The room is located in the executive suite with sea view on the 16th floor. It faces the beach. It is very beautiful. The facilities in the room are complete. The breakfast in the hotel is very rich and delicious. The service staff are friendly. The hotel has its own swimming pool, which is clean. The staff take care of it every day, and the lifeguards are very responsible. , When taking the child into the water, it will remind the depth of the water in time. I stayed for five days and four nights, and I felt very good. When I finally checked out, the hotel refunded the deposit within 15 minutes, which is great! Ascott Sanya will be our first choice next time.

This time there was an unforgivable problem. I complained to the manager on duty and it was not resolved well.
On December 14th, I took my parents to stay in the Ascott Two-Bedroom Suite since I checked in in the afternoon. The downstairs has been undergoing renovations very noisily. I called the front desk and told them that even the front desk staff themselves didn’t know about the renovations they were doing outside, but they promised to finish it immediately. But the sound didn't stop and continued until 9:30 pm. We were ready to take a rest and called the front desk again. I didn't know if it was a new employee at the front desk. He casually replied to me and asked me to try to finish it before 11 pm. I was really shocked. Another person answered the phone and told us to deal with the evening's affairs immediately and that was pretty much it. The decoration started again after 7 or 8 o'clock the next morning. I couldn't rest at all until I checked out at 12 noon. When I checked out, I met the manager on duty that day in the lobby and happily communicated this matter. The final solution for me was to let me stay again and upgrade my room type, which means that this time the complaint has not been handled and secondary sales have been started again. As a salesperson, this is a good thing, but as a lobby manager, it is definitely unscientific to handle complaints. If I didn’t handle it this time, I might not be able to come next time. I started thinking about upgrading the room type next time. I hope the platform and the hotel can handle it as soon as possible without wasting each other’s time.

I would definitely give a five-star praise, but after checking out, the front desk of the hotel kept calling me because of the shower gel to ask me what was going on. When I left, the shampoo, shower gel, and conditioner were all there. They are kept together. It is impossible that you can’t find a bottle of shower gel.

msg:I often stay at Ascott in other cities. Seeing that this hotel is in a good location and is newly opened, I chose it without hesitation. I didn't expect it to be so bad. 1. When I checked in, I noticed a reddish-brown stain under the toilet. I understood that, so I immediately communicated with the housekeeper, and the housekeeper said that he would give me a bottle of moisturizing lotion. Even the most basic hygiene is not up to par. Am I short of moisturizer? After communicating for a whole afternoon, we finally agreed to upgrade the room. 2. The new room is not well shaded. The window is a normal shade, but the other one is a blind, which does not block the light at all. It wakes me up automatically every morning, even if I add a shade, I'm sorry to trouble the housekeeper again, so I can just sleep on my own. 3. We are traveling with children, so we are very careful about mosquitoes outside and are ready to spray at any time. Unexpectedly, in the room, adults and children were bitten by more than 20 times. We are really speechless. There are mosquitoes in the room, but we are not prepared. Mosquito coils? I asked someone to deliver it at around 2 o'clock in the middle of the night, but only one was delivered. He was still bitten the next day, and I asked someone to deliver 4 more and inserted them all over the place to survive. 4. The most important point: the two children had vomiting and diarrhea after breakfast in the hotel. They started vomiting at noon after eating in the morning and had diarrhea for two days. They have not recovered until now. The children have not eaten anything else except breakfast. Adults If you order takeout but don’t eat it, your child will suffer. It was unlucky to book this hotel. My child vomited on the sheets and asked me for extra cleaning fees. I didn’t realize it at the time and immediately transferred the money. The more I thought about it, the more angry I became. It’s good that I didn’t ask you to pay for the medical expenses. The two children are so uncomfortable with diarrhea and vomiting, and it's not because of your hotel breakfast. 5. The funniest point made me laugh. We spent extra money to buy breakfast in our room. The dishes were duplicated, so the adults didn’t eat at all in the next few days. Children under 1.2 meters tall didn’t know whether there was any charge. I accompanied them. The child went to get a piece of bread and asked the breakfast front desk to get a packing box. She told me that there was no such thing. I said that I saw someone packing it yesterday. She said that they packed it without sitting down to eat. I said that I didn't sit down to eat either. Ah, she couldn't do anything after a while, and I was too lazy to talk nonsense with her. I took two pieces of bread with a napkin and took the child away directly. I don't know how valuable the bread in this store is. This arrogant person, hahaha, was speechless. 6. If I have time and need, I will definitely complain to the end. 7. I don’t know if the formaldehyde in the newly renovated hotel exceeds the standard. Anyway, it smells like decoration. It is absolutely impossible for me to book this hotel again.

It is really worthy of praise (the hotel will charge pet cleaning fees), and the price is super high. The location is in Dadonghai, 5 minutes away is Dadonghai Night Market and Summer Depar**ent Store, and Dadonghai Beach is nearby. I booked the Ruobi Neighboring Suite, two rooms, super big, beautiful sea view, and I like the bedding very much. Because the hotel is newly opened, there are not too many people. It feels much better than the old resort hotels. The breakfast buffet is very good, and the variety basically meets the needs. If you come to Sanya organically again, Ascott is the first choice. I hope to continue to maintain this quality

msg:Stayed for 5 days and 4 nights. Although the newly opened apar**ent has some shortcomings, the overall experience is good

Let me talk about the advantages first:
We arrived at one o'clock in the afternoon. We thought we needed to wait for the cleaning, but we didn't expect to be able to check in directly. The one-bedroom sea view room we booked, the front desk staff was very sweet and helped to upgrade it to a deluxe sea view room. The high-rise sea view is really beautiful, love it ! The color tone and design of Ascott's rooms are comfortable, and the soft furnishings are simple and elegant. It really feels like coming home.
The young lady who took us in was very enthusiastic and professional. There is a short distance from the front desk to the apar**ent building, passing the gym, swimming pool and restaurant on the way, and she explained everything clearly.
Late May is the off-season, the occupancy rate of the apar**ent is low, the sleep is very quiet, the bedding is very comfortable, and I slept very comfortably for four nights.
The restaurant is bright and tidy. Although it is not big, the distance between the tables is very reasonable. You don’t disturb each other when you eat. There are not many breakfast and lunch styles, but they are still exquisite. The experience is good~ I booked a free lunch for two in the room package, and I went downstairs to eat when I was hungry at noon , so convenient
The swimming pool is very large, with a depth of about 1.5 to 1.6 meters. There are not many people, and it is very refreshing to swim.
On the last day of departure, because it was a late flight, I contacted Xiao Fu, a staff member in the reservation depar**ent, to help apply for a late check-out. The response was timely, thank you very much

Let me talk about some deficiencies:
I feel that some of the front desk staff are not proficient in their business. It is difficult to communicate during check-in and some procedures. They feel like they are not awake and not refreshed during the reception. Training should be strengthened on this point.
In the newly opened apar**ent this year, the decoration smell left in the room is indeed very strong, especially the wardrobe, which will be very pungent and pungent once opened. Because I have rhinitis and pharyngitis myself, after smelling the decoration smell for a long time, I not only have a sore throat but also dizziness. When I first checked in, the smell was so strong that I wanted to change hotels. After giving feedback to the room service, a purifier was sent, which is really powerful. After turning on the purifier, the smell in the room can hardly be smelled after a while, and the experience is much better.
The kitchen utensils and knives are not fully equipped. After asking, it is because the building is relatively new and the occupancy rate is relatively low, so it is not yet fully equipped. If you need it, you can contact and send it at any time. But I think that since the check-in has been arranged, shouldn't everything be fully equipped? If you still need to contact and wait, it is quite troublesome to be honest.
The welcome fruit is very rich, but there is no knife and fork to cut the fruit. It is not very thoughtful and I hope to improve.
The room was not cleaned very carefully. The water leak in the shower room was not cleaned. It was blocked after two days of use. I couldn’t come out to ask someone to unclog it while taking a shower. Later, it took me a long time to unclog it by myself. This experience was really not good.
One night, a huge cockroach was found in the room, and I froze in fright. I called the staff to deal with it. Maybe because it was 11 o'clock in the evening, the response speed was a bit slow, and the cockroach almost ran away. Deworming still needs to be strengthened! It's terrible!


In short, the newly opened hotel apar**ent still has a lot of room for improvement, and I hope it will be better next time.

It is different from Five-star hotels provide more entertainment space, and Ascott can save some unnecessary space and items with less experience time, so as to provide a home-like feeling for those of us who travel all year round, especially in the heat of Sanya. It’s a good place to wash and dry clothes every day. The front desk has upgraded a luxurious executive sea view suite. The living room and bedroom both face the sea view.

Location: In Dadonghai, very close to the business district and the airport, it is very convenient to take a taxi, and you only need to cross the road to walk to the beach
Environment: Our room type is an executive one-bedroom room. I was shocked when I entered the room. It is too big... 88 square meters is really not an exaggeration. It is much larger than the 5k-a-night Capella I stayed in before. After all, it is newly opened, and the smell is a little bit, but the room is tidy and clean, and the view from the window is superb! ! !
Facilities: It is super convenient to have a refrigerator. We bought a lot of food and put it in the refrigerator, and the bathtub is also very big! ! We said we needed to use the washing machine, and enthusiastically gave us a lot of laundry detergent, and there is also a drying rack for drying! Satisfied~
Service: The younger brothers and sisters at the front desk are very enthusiastic. They lead us to the building of the room and introduce the hotel's facilities one by one. The gym and swimming pool are very good, small but fine. I went to have breakfast in the morning, and the service was very warm. Compared with other hotels, the variety of breakfast is not so rich, but it is also very good~ I can go swimming after eating enough🏊♀️

msg:The Ascott hotel that came before Labor Day is a hotel that just opened during the Spring Festival this year. ￼Ascott is a hotel management group in Singapore mainly for family suites.
Facilities: Very new, ￼￼except for the basic square twin room, it is basically a suite. ￼This time, I booked a basic room with a colleague of a different gender. The water in the bathtub in the bathroom is slightly cloudy, but everything else is fine.

Sanitation: Because it is a newly opened hotel, the sanitation of the room and the sanitation of the bathroom can meet my requirements. ￼
Environment: The lobby of the hotel needs to take the elevator on the ground to go up to a platform with a large area￼There are tropical plants everywhere, which makes it feel like a vacation.

￼
Service: The service at the swimming pool is a bit behind the front desk of the swimming pool. No one is at least there, so when I went to the swimming pool to ask for the key to the locker room, I looked for someone for a long time.

Breakfast: ￼Because there were some other five-star hotels in Sanya before I came to this store. The breakfast in this store is definitely more in line with my taste, and the quality is relatively high. ￼Recommended is salmon salad. The fly in the oin**ent is that the sea view of my room is blocked by the building in front, which is half okay, I can only see a little bit of the bay.

msg:Due to the change of the planned itinerary, I need to arrive in Sanya earlier. I am used to booking hotel pre-sale packages on Ctrip. I found that I have never been to Dadonghai, and this hotel can be reserved one day in advance, so I settled down.
As soon as I came in, the gentle Sunday Xiaoye greeted the check-in. The lady spoke really softly and softly. When I saw the twin room reserved for our family of three, she said that it was really uncomfortable to sleep in this crowded room. Change me to a lower floor. The two-bedroom suite is a super expensive room, because I was hesitant because I really wanted to see the sea on the first day, and then Sister Ye said that I should go and see all of them, choose one I like, and Prince Wang will bring it to me. Watching the house with me, and humorously said that you will definitely choose the suite. After reading it, I found out that for all the rooms in Building No. 2 and even Building No. 1, the Auto Court Collection in the wealthy area in front is the biggest obstacle to the scenery, okay?
I accepted Sister Ye's kindness, and after entering the room, I found that the suite is really well equipped, including refrigerator, toaster, capsule coffee machine, dishwasher, kettle, knives, microwave oven, induction cooker, water purifier, oven, washing machine, Everything you need for a pan, even oven mitts. The coffee includes capsule coffee and instant black coffee, and the black tea and green tea are from Dilmah. After breakfast, drinking the coffee delivered by the hotel with your family on the balcony feels like a vacation.
The only fly in the oin**ent is that the hotel has just opened for one or two months. People with a good sense of smell (the kind that can smell the stuffed dumplings today) said that the master bedroom of the two-bedroom suite still smells, and the living room and the second bedroom are almost the same. No smell is acceptable, because there are balconies in these two places, and most of the smell will be blown away when the door is opened. The ventilation in the master bedroom is really not good. If the master bedroom and the living room can be opened in the original design, the balcony will blow all at once. Come in, it should be much better. There is no need to worry about ordinary twin rooms, because there is only one room, and the balcony door can be opened, and the overall flaws are not concealed.
Tony Li in the fitness area is too talkative, the lifeguards are really responsible, they keep an eye on the guests as soon as they enter the pool.
The roasted tofu for breakfast is a must, and the spring rolls and fried dumplings are even more outstanding. The stewed beef cubes really melt in the mouth, which shocked me.
Finally, I would like to thank Sister Ye and Brother Xiaowang for their service. When the master bedroom tastes better, I will definitely consider long-term rental for families.
I really like Dadonghai. There are few people in the off-season and the scenery is beautiful. During the day, you can monopolize the clean hotel swimming pool, which is in sharp contrast to the Yalong Bay next door. Yalong Bay is always full of people!

The breakfast buffet in the hotel is also good. There are many varieties. The goods are replenished in a timely manner. There will be no empty booths. The only drawback is that every chef has no hat and I got hair in the noodles. The waiter was very quick when he arrived and took it away immediately. There was no time to take photos;
The staff will basically say hello when they see them; the gym is always open; the swimming pool is clean and cleaned in a timely manner without any large garbage or stolen goods; the rooms are large and the facilities are new, suitable for vacations
I will book this hotel next time I have a chance.

msg:The wonderful check-in experience was broken on the second day. After breakfast, I found that the room card could not be swiped to open the door, so I went to the front desk to recreate the room card. Before I went out, I asked the front desk to arrange for the room to be cleaned. When I came back, my bathrobe and slippers were missing. I called to have them brought back. When I opened the door, the first thing the waiter said was: What's going on? After asking him to go in and check, he placed a new one for me. I wonder if I would be mistaken for taking it if I checked out. Then I found that the cleaning was rather perfunctory, the water stains on the table were not wiped, and there was one missing towel, so I had to give it away again. This makes me feel that the hygiene situation may be worse than expected.
At the beginning of my stay, the warm service at the front desk made me feel at home. The room facilities were also very new, and the view and environment were very good. I strongly recommended the hotel to my friends who live in Haitang Bay, but the lack of details made me a little disappointed. Others Overall it's pretty good. Breakfast was average.

msg:A family of four stayed in the hotel with their children. The front desk learned about our situation and assisted in upgrading the room from an executive one-bedroom and one living room to two-bedroom and one living room. The room was very pleasantly surprised, mainly because of the first-class mattress and bedding, the brand-new Ascott unified classic decoration, and the water pressure in the rain, all of which made me nostalgic for this place. The floor is not high but it is still a sea view room. I am used to the spacious rooms and large balconies here, so we can always think of Ascott when we go to other cities for accommodation in the future.
The apar**ent service is also very good. The breakfast until 11 o'clock is too friendly, which directly saves the lunch time. The service staff in the recreation center and swimming pool are also very friendly.
Newly opened, there will definitely be such and such a perfect process, but it is not important to us, the comfort of living, as comfortable as at home, is what we value most.
It's very close to the beach, Dadonghai cannot go into the sea, and the hotel's swimming pool is superb. I will live here with the elderly in the future.

msg:I booked for 5 nights and they upgraded me. Let me tell you why I booked this hotel. 1: It is a very rare, very new hotel. There is no sanitary dead corner inside and outside. I am very grateful for mysophobic patients. 2: There is a desk in the room, which is more in line with my vacation and business needs than the small coffee table in many hotels. 3: There is a large refrigerator and a microwave oven, which is convenient for me to put a lot of fruits and hot food at any time, just like my work and rest at home. If you follow these differentiated advantages I picked out, then these are exactly the selling points of this apar**ent: 1⃣️ Sanya (Hainan) newly opened hotel, more than many five-star run-down hotels can attract some people who care about the hotel environment; 2⃣️ The apar**ent does not have a magnificent lobby, a variety of restaurants, entertainment rooms and other hotel facilities that occupy public areas. Instead, it provides large-area multi-functional rooms with super cost-effectiveness, which makes users feel that their money is better spent. 3⃣️It feels more like home than a resort hotel. The TVC of the TV in your room is very well shot, but the hotel promotion scripts on your TikTok, Xiaomoushu, and the public are biased. You use your own shortcomings to market, which is not attractive. In summary, I have been in Hainan for more than 20 days and have experienced hotels with sea views and beach vacations, so I am quite satisfied with the characteristics of Shiya Pavilion, but the "home" feeling created by the hotel service staff is not enough. I took a big box in and out of the hotel, and no one helped me with my luggage, and you-**, the front desk lobby, Building 2, for me who lives in Building 1, it should be the most inconvenient design in the former world hotel, but no one of your staff paid attention to me. When I checked out, I asked when the deposit was expected to be returned to me. What was your answer: "Madam, you can leave the hotel now"! ! Shouldn't you explain first why you spend so much time checking the room and why other hotels don't require deposits, but you have low emotional intelligence. . Install some charging piles in the parking lot, and there are no nearby hotels

msg:The area around the hotel is inconvenient. It’s too close to drive and too far to walk to eat.
The so-called sea view room is just that the sea view taken from the highest place is okay. In fact, the front is directly blocked by the mountains, sea and sky. You can have some sea view when you look around. The real thing is facing other buildings.
The soundproofing of the room is also very poor. I am woken up by various noises every morning, after 7 o'clock.
The kitchen and bathroom were dissatisfied and used a plate to microwave something without any prompting. As a result, the plate naturally cracked and they were compensated 50 RMB. In my humble opinion, the plate is no different from the ones in ordinary supermarkets.
Guests talk about it, you can see for yourself

msg:I took my dog out to play and saw the newly opened Ascott in Sanya. I have always chosen this hotel in Singapore, the UK. The hotel facilities and environment are very, very good. When I checked in on the first day, I met the manager at the front desk. It makes people feel more cordial! The staff will greet you politely, and you will feel at home in every detail. The beautiful view also made us decide to stay an extra night. Finally, there is a small suggestion that the cleaning ladies may be very young, and the manager needs to be reminded to clean up some dead corners that are easily overlooked. The cleaning and tidying can be improved to reach the real level of Ascott . Overall, I am very satisfied. I will stay here next time I come to Sanya.

msg:After staying for a week, let me talk about the shortcomings first. The sound insulation of the hotel is extremely poor. The installed glass has almost no sound insulation effect. Lying on the bed, the sound of vehicles passing by on the road outside in the middle of the night is like driving in your room. , and it rained every night during the few days I stayed. When it rained, the noise outside was extremely loud, which is not an exaggeration at all. The sound of the rain really made people like me who are not sensitive to sound suspicious of their lives (attached) You can hear it in the video) The curtains at the bedside of the room do not block light at all. It is really uncomfortable to sleep with sensitivity to light.
The hotel's hygiene is good and there is a kitchen in the room. It is very convenient if you want to cook by yourself. The service staff are also very enthusiastic.

msg:I booked this hotel for the newly opened Ascott. I originally planned to stay for 5 days, but I reluctantly stayed for one night and checked out. Let’s talk about what I’m not satisfied with. First of all, the attitude of the front desk. I went back to the state-owned guest house instantly. There was no smile the whole time and they were bossy. Even though I’m a good-tempered person, I couldn’t help but raise my voice. It was really hurtful. The room was very small, with no space except for the bed. It felt stuffy when the door was closed, and there was no air conditioning when the door was open. The room facilities are not good. The coffee machine needs to be repaired by the waiter before it can be used. Is this a newly opened hotel? There is no air conditioning in the elevator hall, corridors, and entertainment rooms, and the lights are dim. In the summer in Sanya, public areas without air conditioning? A hotel at night with no lights? The water in the swimming pool was dirty and there were no towels or slippers. The sea view feels like a bay view, not vast, not to mention that there is a building blocking the front. Everything in the hotel must be confirmed again and again. Are you treating the customers as thieves? After taking a closer look at the supplies, they were actually pretty good, but the service was really annoying. Ascott is a very good brand, so why has it turned into a guest house? An annoying trip, not recommended to stay.

However, there are many shortcomings. For example, the quality of the service staff is not up to par, and there is basically no service. When I checked in, the front desk of the hotel was scolding the **** guy. After the room was cleaned, there were still a lot of paper scraps and large particles of sand on the floor. It was a drawback. The biggest thing is that there is basically no soundproofing in the hotel. The newly opened hotel opposite is being renovated. It starts at about six o'clock in the morning. You can click on the video to experience it. It is not a low floor, but more than ten floors. The overall stay experience was poor.

I only suggest that the hotel cherish the brand image and strengthen internal management.

msg:There was no notice for the fire drill. I woke up in my sleep and rushed downstairs, thinking I was going to be burned to death. Who knew it was a drill? The attitude of the people who came back was also very casual. Just touch the upper lip to the lower lip and that was it. They just said polite words such as Mr. , I'm really sorry. We will work hard to correct the service. To put it bluntly, I don't know whether you will correct it later. I just stayed in the hotel. At the moment, remember, I am very unhappy! With this attitude, the underlying logic is that the hotel and the tenants are in a cooperative relationship. If Party B makes Party A dissatisfied, can I continue to cooperate with you if Party B just talks? Is this sincerity? Let me tell you, as a hotel, in addition to admitting its mistakes, the only way to show the greatest sincerity to guests is to "upgrade the room type." A five-star hotel wants to calm down the trouble at the drop of a dime. Where is your service? I am not anonymous. If your hotel reads my comments and sneers behind your back, thinking that this guest is just trying to make a small profit and is causing trouble here, then I wish your management team good luck in running the hotel and it will get better and better.

There is only one elevator in each building, and then I walk through 30 It is very cold outside, then enter the lobby of Building 2, then go through the outside, and then enter the very cold hotel lobby. It is extremely cold, it is estimated to be only about 15 degrees, and then go through the lobby to the outdoor takeaway cabinet. After getting the takeaway, return the same way.
The cleaning is pretty good and the hygiene is maintained well. There is also a parking problem. There are parking spaces outside, but you have to give up parking in the underground garage. The outdoor parking spaces are just like the furnishings and are not allowed to enter.

msg:This is a bad hotel booking. The whole process showed Ascott's arrogant work style and service attitude. Originally reported great expectations for Ascott and booked to stay in this hotel on April 28, but I was very unlucky. On the second day after arriving in Haikou, my mother who was traveling with me got sick. Then I communicated with Ctrip early in the morning whether I could cancel the reservation or postpone the check-in date, and provided evidence such as antigen results and thermometers. Ctrip's housekeepers Min Min and Yang Yang helped me communicate with the hotel about related matters. The results of the communication ranged from either providing hospital certificates Up to 20% refund, and then 50% refund, and inform that this is the limit. If you postpone the check-in, you will be charged according to the listed price on the day of the postponed move-in date. Because the hotel doesn't think it will have any impact on their service staff and other guests. Thanks to the housekeepers Min Min and Yang Yang who have been helping and communicating with me during this process. It really deserves the title of Ctrip housekeeper. But Ascott, as an established five-star apar**ent with excellent service, do you deserve this title? It is an irresponsible attitude to think that there will be no impact on the staff and other guests. Do your sales managers take your brand value into consideration when refusing to properly accommodate guest requests? There is no next time, I will leave a message for you, I hope everyone will resolutely avoid black, five-star price, and no-star service.

Ascott has always been in the field of long-term business stays, but this Ascott has integrated many holiday Staycation elements under the apar**ent-style brand positioning to fit the overall a**osphere of Sanya. The two-bedroom suite is very generous in space, and the 270-degree sea view can be overlooked from the balcony at any time. The facilities in the room are also high-end brands. From check-in to check-out, we were very impressed and exceeded our expectations. I hope that this treasure, Ascott Mountain Sea Sky, will be discovered and explored by more people.

環境：因為擔心天氣熱不出門所以特意訂了海景view的房子，比較可惜1號樓維修，所以備註了想要高層也提前記錄了，給了15層的高層，如果想要3號樓無遮擋再高兩層視野可能更好
設施：社區泳池維修替換了傲途格的泳池，晚上傲途格的無邊泳池氛圍很好；房屋內部備品aa，餐具廚具一應俱全
總體來説非常滿意，下次來體驗1號樓

喜歡那道椰漿飯，椰奶味十足搭配了小魚仔和特質的辣椒醬。香香辣辣的！清爽解膩。推薦喜歡馬來西亞和海南菜系的一定要來嚐嚐。

酒店後山有個卡比鎮的打卡！那個粉紅牆，和車站打卡都超有趣味性。超級出片！拍攝了好多美照發在朋友圈。

晚上在餐廳吃完飯，散散步心情美美噠，全程前台小管家服務特別熱情主動親切，還給我推薦了芒果沾辣椒，[憨笑][憨笑]很不一樣的味道！！好吃😋

衞生：阿姨打掃衞生乾淨，居然主動清理我們用過的餐具餐盤。補充洗漱用品，太讚了。，服務員還推薦了附近的美食！
設施：餐廳裝修很精緻，就連餐廳的菜單都很有意思。海南粉是我在海南省吃過最好吃的小吃了，酒店基礎設施還是比較齊全的。在3棟有個遊樂室和挖沙的地方玩我們還碰到了可愛的小松鼠，
這次旅行非常快樂已經推薦同事了，下次來認準雅詩閣

最後提出一點不足，1073房間浴室的窗户外面太臟了幾乎看不清窗外的風景，雖然需要高空作業才能打掃到，但還是希望能打掃一下，不然實在是很可惜。

比較奇怪的是放在房間內的一個備用小背包不見了，雖然不貴而且裏面應該是空的，但還是感覺有點遺憾。

msg:各方面都不錯，就是服務非常不到位，服務不及時。首先是辦理入住方面，辦完入住手續以後，前台工作人員沒有指引入口樓棟位置，入住房間明明在另一棟樓，卻衹説了前面左拐。提着兩個大行李箱走過去刷電梯發現刷不了，衹能提着行李走回前台問情況，前台説要再裏面走，還要再往後走一棟。曬着大太陽提着行李走到對應樓棟以後發現電梯還是刷不了卡，再問前台，説是我的房間號是1071，房間是在7樓（？？？那房間號這種情況為什麼不提前説？？？明知道入住樓棟在另一棟，前台除了辦理入住的幾個前台，還有一個門僮就不會稍微帶下路嗎？？）。  其次是業務水平不行，到房間以後，打電話問客服，洗衣機怎麼用結果一問三不知，説馬上讓工作人員來看。等了半個多小時也不見人上來。好不容易等到人上來，也不會用。要打電話問另一個工作人員。因為晚飯沒吃，後來就先出門吃飯，吃完飯回來打電話問客服洗衣機怎麼用洗烘功能，又説要讓工作人員上來，我説了今天上來過工作人員解決不了，讓他們找懂業務的搞清楚再回復我。等到凌晨才回復，準備刷牙睡覺，結果發現沒牙刷，打電話給前台送牙刷，又是等了半個多小時才送上來。

首先酒店的裝修並沒有我想象中的那麼簡單，房間整體非常簡約大氣，風景出乎我意料，無敵海景。
布草也非常舒服。
最讓人感到心情愉悦的還是小許和小羅的服務，相對於其他的酒店，我感覺她們的禮貌用語和表情管理遠超傲途格和麗斯。
以後基本就常住在這了，真的很棒！

Завтраки замечательные, выбор огромный и все вкусно. Хороший ресторан - приятно как завтракать, так и на ужин приходить. Есть неплохой тренажерный зал.

出發前就看好了雅詩閣但是沒有訂，一直到臨近了入住日期突然給了三亞的什麼優惠券，不到400訂了園景行政套房，結果到了房間發現是有海景的哈哈哈超級驚喜。
住在1棟，是2梯4户的格局，酒店的早餐蠻豐富啊，該有的都有，現煮的麪粉檔也有，粉很好吃，都不需要去外面餐廳打卡抱羅粉了。另外連住兩天，早餐除了自助以外，還會有額外的點心服務小哥會來問每桌要不要，第一天是豉汁蒸鳳爪，第二天是皮蛋瘦肉粥，真的蠻不錯的。而且早餐時間到11點，非常適合懶覺星人。
廚房也挺好用，洗衣機帶烘乾不要太方便！游泳池比較大，適合愛游泳的人。
唯一一點要注意的，可能因為酒店新開，房間裏的各種裝修味道還是比較大。如果鼻子不太舒服，或者有帶小朋友，可能需要小心。

特別要説服務人員態度超好和貼心，退房後想去小童樂園拍個照，工作人員在下班時間也熱心幫忙。
對比後面去的幾個海灘，大東海這個位置其實很不錯，又能下水，風景環境也好，酒店房間也能看到不錯海景。對於不想趕景點，想來三亞住的人，在這裏長待也是不錯的選擇。已經要了銷售名片以後帶家人來度假首選。
唯一能想到的缺點是房間新，所以剛進去還是有點味道，不過瑕不掩瑜，找前台要了的空氣凈化器，住三天後麪就沒啥味道了。

設施：非常齊全比酒店還好
衞生：整個酒店給人感覺感覺，整潔

提幾點建議供參考：1.部份房間（#3樓棟）裝修氣味需要散掉，可以聘請專業機構清除氣味、擺放綠植盆栽、所有櫃子放活性炭包，以及最重要的門窗打開、對流通風。2.增聘員工，避免因為人手短缺影響服務效率。3.早餐味道很好，品種可以再多元化一點，空調定期檢修保養。4.小童活動室的遊樂項目相對少及單一。
