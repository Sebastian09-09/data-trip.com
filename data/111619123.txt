msg:I was on a business trip from Shenzhen to Shanghai. I chose this hotel before I took a flight back the next day. I didn't expect it to surprise me.
1. It is a newly opened hotel last year. The environment and sanitation are very clean. The scenery from the window is sunny and open;
2. Smart hotel. All operations in the room can be completed by calling Xiaodu Xiaodu, which is very convenient;
3. The room uses olive wood products, which makes people smell very comfortable when washing;
4. Because it is Saturday, it is close to 10 o'clock when I go to the restaurant for breakfast. The auntie who cooks noodles and every waiter are not impatient at all. The restaurant is very clean. Even if the breakfast time is almost over, there are still many breakfast varieties and the freshness is also online. It is very niceee~ A good day starts with a delicious breakfast.
5. It only takes 13 minutes from the hotel to Hongqiao Airport. It is very close and there is no traffic jam throughout the journey.

It is really good. I hope it will be maintained as always. Next time, I will recommend this hotel to those who take a flight from Hongqiao Airport. 👍

The hotel service is very good, the room is clean and tidy, and it has high-tech smart devices! This hotel has the best value for money among the five-star hotels I have stayed in. The price is affordable and the quality is really excellent. The sheets are clean and comfortable. I hope it can be maintained as always. I will stay here next time! The disadvantage is that the diligent cleaning starts cleaning early in the morning, and the noise is very loud. I hope to change the cleaning time in the future. It is really a bit disturbing in the early morning.
I hope to maintain the current level, seriously.

They always respond to my needs in a timely manner, which makes me feel the warmth of home. The facilities of the hotel are also very complete.

msg:Thank you very much for the careful arrangement and unique surprise of Shanghai Hongqiao Yankuang Yujinxiang Hotel, which added countless unforgettable memories to my lover's birthday!

The hotel's decoration design is ingenious, and the clever combination of walnut color and orange leather shows both noble elegance and liveliness and warmth.

The hotel's intelligent guest control system is even more amazing. Through innovative designs such as light *****s and downlights, a comfortable lighting effect without a main light is achieved. The smart voice assistant Xiaodu in the room and the convenient button operation provide us with a variety of scene choices. The lights and curtains automatically open when entering the house, which makes the journey home full of ritual.

The breakfast options are also rich and colorful, combining Chinese and Western styles to meet the needs of different tastes. Especially the full-sized vermicelli, the taste is authentic and memorable.

Overall, Shanghai Hongqiao Yankuang Yujinxiang Hotel left a deep impression on me. Whether it is service, environment or food, it is first-class. In the future, I will definitely visit again and recommend this excellent hotel to more friends. Thank you for the perfect experience you brought us!

msg:When I went to Qingpu this time, I discovered the Treasure Hotel under Jinjiang. The whole hotel has smart face recognition for entry and exit (it really allows you to scan your face to open the door, and it doesn’t matter if you forget to bring your room card🥹). It’s safe and secure. You can reach your floor only by face recognition. Takeaways It was also sent by a robot.

Environment: Few people know about it since it opened soon, it is very quiet, the decoration is very new, modern, simple and luxurious. The details can also stand up to scrutiny (unlike some hotels that pay attention to face), including the gym, laundry room, restaurant and bar.

Service: Ms. Liang of the catering depar**ent and a male person in charge (didn’t see the name clearly😂) are kind and friendly, making you feel at home.

Facilities: The suite has a large space, a reasonable layout and no messy furnishings. It uses Oulon's cleaning and care products. Knowing that we are bringing children, children's supplies will also be provided.

Comments I would like to make:
There are too few trash cans in the room.
The security guard at the door was dumbfounded. We were the only ones in the car when we checked in. We should have been impressed after going in and out several times... but we were stopped every time and asked what we were doing... (the granularity of the housekeeping depar**ent was not aligned!!)

It is very close to Qingpu Outlet, Sky Vanke and Yuanzu Dream World. I will choose this place next time I go there.

There are two types of suites, one with a bathtub and one without a bathtub. . . The merchant first gave me a room without a bathtub, and there was also a box of express delivery in the room. . Obviously a room without a bathtub is smaller than a room with a bathtub~
Later, I was not satisfied and asked the merchant to change the room to a room with a bathtub. It was now much more spacious and bright. . But the faucet in the bathroom was stained again. . . Tsk tsk. .

msg:I rarely review hotels, but this is a hotel that I would be embarrassed not to give a thumbs up after staying in. It is newly opened, not to mention super clean, with novel decoration and trendy functions. The most important thing is that the quilt is thin. Many hotels do not change the quilt in summer. It's hot and airless, and it's cold without the air conditioner. I feel like I've made a profit for the price of this stay.

If the window is opened a little, the sound from the construction site outside is loud. If it is not opened, the smell is very strong. The service is responsive. It was also not timely, and the things I asked for were never delivered. This needs to be improved.

msg:The hotel facilities are new and the environment is good, but the service is poor. The two pillows are hard and high. I can't sleep well for one night. The quilt is winter and the air conditioner is useless at 18 degrees. It should be constant temperature. I use winter quilt in Shanghai in September. Hot, it is rare to pay a deposit when staying in a hotel. This hotel requires a deposit of 500. It is said to be used for paid consumption in the room, but in fact the room is empty and there is nothing to spend. When I checked out at 11 o'clock, the deposit was not refunded. In the afternoon At around three o'clock, I asked when the deposit would be refunded. The front desk said that I would refund the room immediately after check-out. I said that I checked out at 11 o'clock, and the front desk said that I would refund after checking. After two days, the deposit was not refunded. I called to ask when the deposit would be refunded. Let me check. I think if I forget this, the hotel will not refund the deposit. I seriously doubt that the hotel did it on purpose, so I will not choose such a hotel a second time. I also remind everyone to be careful. , it doesn’t matter whether the house price is high or low. Those who should refund should be refunded immediately instead of waiting for us to remind them every now and then.

msg:Needless to say, the environmental hygiene of the newly opened hotel looks clean and hygienic. Mainly complaining about the bad experience, hope it can be improved... 1. The hotel is in a separate area, the ground is very empty, but there is no parking space, you must park underground. 2. In this summer weather, the air conditioner in the room was not cooling after being turned on for two hours. I called the front desk and asked the guest room and engineering to take a look at it. After half an hour, it was still not fixed. They actually didn’t offer to change the room for me and asked me to continue. Wait, I had to ask for another room before I was moved to another room. 3. As a result, I was moved to another room. The air conditioner could only cool down to a minimum of 24.5 degrees, and the temperature in the room could not be lowered. I was already afraid of heat, and it was still there at 12 o'clock at night. At this temperature, I realized that it might be a constant-temperature air conditioning system, which is amazing... 4. The room is a bit dry. I don't know if it is a problem with the new decoration. There is still a sour smell despite the air purifier in the room. 5. The towels were actually lint-free and there were black stains on the sheets. 6. The temperature response of hot water adjus**ent is relatively slow. 7. The bed I slept in made a strange noise when turning over. I don’t know if it is like this in other rooms.
