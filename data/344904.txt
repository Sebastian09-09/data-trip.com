The swimming staff were beyond helpful and great. Nobody in the hotel could really speak English ambit they did their best to make us feel comfortable. 

The only negative aspect, is that in the mornings, there were people singing outside the hotel (by the beach), with very loud speakers and we weren’t able to have a nice sleep.

The building is a little dated, but it was clean. The beds were rock hard, which is normal in China, but hard to sleep at night because they were so hard.

msg:The hotel is not five stars! We have been living in China for a long time and we always live in hotels. This was the worst hotel out of many. They changed our room four times. The first room had a view of the construction site and, accordingly, there was terrible noise. The second room was terribly dirty (I walked on the floor in white socks and threw them away after that). Plus, this room had blinds instead of a wall to the toilet, which is terribly inconvenient with a child. The third room was clean and renovated, but again looked like a construction site. The fourth room was after renovation, clean and with a good view of the sea. There is a nuance: if you have a sea view, then in the evening get ready for a concert on the embankment. Breakfasts are aimed only at Asian cuisine. The children's area is very small. The pool is not the same as in the photo. The water slides are no longer there and are in need of renovation. There is plenty of food and children's attractions nearby.

The hotel is very clean although old, and there is loud music being played in the hallways. The pool was pretty but too cold to go for a swim.  Would probably not stay there again.

msg:We enjoyed our stay at this hotel. Really friendly and polite staff, one spoke english as well for Foreigners that can't speak Chinese, plus the set up for our Daughter in the family suite was very thoughtful. She had sinks she could reach, cute panda toothbrushes delivered every day, her own themed cup, toys to play with, mini robe, her own bed all though she preferred the big one haha, shoes etc. That was the greatest plus with this hotel, she absolutely loved it because of those details. The view is beautiful as well, clean but old rooms I'd say, it was worn down quite a bit so maintaining the hotel is definitely something they would have to work on. Several Restaurants close by also for online delivery. The biggest downside with this hotel is the beach unfortunately. We chose this place because of a more quiet beach, we thought the least, but the water scooters/jet skies roaming around constantly forced us to take a taxi to the busy beaches. The smell of gas was horrible and very strong when the jet skies passed by as they are driving where everyone is swimming. Very unhealthy to breathe in and they are about 6-8 of them driving by all the time, nothing I would want anyone to breathe in and it is a safety concern, they could literally drive over you anytime. Later at night when they had all left the beach it was a great place for shell picking though. The more busy beaches have set up restrictions for these water jet skies, which prohibits them from driving there, therefore next time we go to Sanya we will choose one of the hotels around Yalong or Dadonghai. You constantly hear helicopters flying as well, but you sort of get used to that.

On the 17th floor and a great view of the ocean from the balcony. It is a bit out of date and needs updating but we were comfortable. However, we were the only foreigners who stayed at the hotel and many staff did not speak English (except 2) but they were so hospitable and helpful. Ken is the best! We were subject to some long staring and photos taken of us (by guests and some staff) but management handled it promptly. There is no spa or hot tub (bummer) but there is a Starbucks station at reception (which is great). Overall, the price is great and it’s quiet. It was relatively easy to get places. We enjoyed ourselves.

He is a very good hotelier who can empathize with guests' difficulties and needs. Xiao Wu at the front desk is also very professional and enthusiastic, helping to solve many problems. However, we arrived at the hotel on the 27th, and at about 1 or 2 in the morning of the 28th, because the air conditioner in the room was too noisy, we found the manager on duty that night. A male manager on duty was very bad. When the guests encountered problems, he said confidently, "I told you a long time ago that there was construction noise in the room during the day, and now you feel the air conditioner is noisy. This is the situation in the room." When the room brings a bad experience to the guests, he looks confident. He is the worst manager on duty I have met in the hotel industry for so many years. A man, very, very ignorant of service, has no sense of service at all. He just knows to get some room upgrades and coupons to get rid of guests. It should be better for Manager Lin and Xiao Wu at the front desk to learn how others understand respect and empathy for guests.

It takes two minutes to walk to Tianya Night Market and very close to Shengli Plaza Shopping Mall. It is in the city and has a first-line sea view in Sanya Bay. It has the best of both worlds. I will consider choosing this Shengyi Hotel again next time.

The room we stayed in was newly renovated, very unique and youthful. I was super satisfied. It really exceeded my expectations. There is a road next to the Sanya Bay Beach and the Coconut Dream Promenade. The waiters were also very enthusiastic, clean and tidy. They also took the initiative to help add hangers to dry clothes. Thank you so much. The swimming pool, gym and children's playground are all available. I will come again.

msg:After choosing for a long time, I finally chose this one based on the recommendation of my friend. The hotel has a superior geographical location, next to the Coconut Dream Promenade in Sanya Bay. This time I booked a sea view room with a first-line sea view. Most importantly, as a city hotel, the transportation is also very convenient. It can really meet the needs of food, accommodation, transportation, entertainment and shopping. I tried their seafood buffet, which is worthy of praise. The seafood dishes are very rich and taste excellent. The small blue dragon, abalone, millet and shark fin soup are also worth recommending. This Shengyi Hotel is suitable for leisure and vacation, business trips, and are all good choices.

msg:Location: The biggest advantage of Shengyi is the location. It is next to Haiyue Square and very close to Coconut Dream Corridor. If you book a 180° sea view room, you can see the entire Sanya Bay.

Facilities: The hotel was built in 2017. Because it is too close to the seaside, the salinity and humidity are too high, and the facilities are basically aging. The hotel has made certain intelligent upgrades.

Hygiene: There is no problem with basic hygiene, and the housekeeping depar**ent cleans up in a timely manner.

Environment: It is a relatively old-school hotel. The area is not very big. There is only one public swimming pool. It can only be said that it has everything you need. The only problem is that it is too close to Haiyue Square. At night, there are migratory bird aunts dancing in the square, which is very loud. , lasts until nine o'clock at night, which may have an impact on people who go to bed early, but has no impact on night owls like ours.

Service: In addition to the location, another thing that satisfied us was the service. We called the hotel to confirm that we had a baby, and the front desk informed the housekeeping depar**ent to bring a baby fence. When we first arrived at the hotel, the receptionist helped us carry our luggage, move our luggage, open the door, deliver our luggage, and receive water... He did a great job; Zhang Qixiang from the reservation depar**ent helped us upgrade our room for two nights, saving us a room change; Youtian bought it After receiving the fruit, Sister Zhong from the housekeeping depar**ent took the initiative to help get the fruit knife and left a note... The family was very satisfied with the service.

When the room staff changed the sheets, they directly placed the dirty four-piece set on another bed, while a friend was resting on the other bed at that time.

When I checked into the first room, I found cockroaches wandering around in the bathroom and bedside. I quickly went to the front desk to change rooms. Fortunately, The problem was solved in a timely manner and we were immediately moved to a newer room on a higher floor, which was much more sanitary.
The location and scenery of the hotel are quite good. You are right across the road from the beach. The room service is also pretty good. If you ask any questions, they can be solved in a timely manner. Because of the cockroach problem, the price difference for the upgraded room type was refunded.
But here we still have to complain about the hotel and the Ctrip platform. Are there any standards for grading hotels? ! Just because of its good location, this hotel can be considered a high-end hotel at best, but not a five-star luxury hotel at all! The wash basin is only the size of a normal basin, with no countertop at all, and there isn't even a place to put a dental cup or facial cleanser next to it! Even after the room was changed to a 180-degree sea view room, the area was very small. There was only a palm's distance between the two beds, and there was no room for people to pass by! Even if the cabinet door is old and doesn't close tightly, the quality of the bedding is also very poor. The mattress is so hard that you can feel the springs underneath! How is the quality of these things rated as a five-star luxury hotel? If this hotel were classified as an ordinary high-end hotel, it might still be rated 4 points overall, but now as a five-star hotel, even 3 points are not enough, and it fails at all!

The view from the key balcony is unparalleled and the hotel is located very close to the sea without any obstruction. When you wake up every day and open the movable curtains, you will see a direct view of the sea! ! ! Do you know the feeling of the sea above your head? ! ! And I saw a rainbow at sea for the first time! Very comfortable! ! If it weren’t for my schedule, I would really like to stay in the hotel and watch Haibao dramas all day without going out! ! ! They are all Xiaoai classmates, and are controlled by Bluetooth smart. This is very convenient. You can also have takeaways delivered by robots without having to go down to get them. There is also very considerate butler service. I come back neatly every day. This trip is really because of the victory. I feel much happier because Hainan is really a food desert🥲

msg:The location is in the center of Sanya Bay, with the beach at the door. There are large supermarkets and shopping malls around, so eating is very convenient. There are also hospitals nearby, so medical trea**ent is convenient. There is a bus stop just a few minutes walk before traveling, making it convenient to go to various scenic spots. The community has relatively complete facilities, but there are relatively few things for children to play, but at this price it is already very good to live in this location. You can also see the sea view. It was originally a temporary reservation for one night, but I later booked it for two more nights. I have already recommended it to my friends.

msg:For ten years, I always stay at Shengyi Seaview Resort Hotel every time I come to Sanya. Firstly, the hotel is in a very good location, right on the edge of Sanya Bay. After exiting the hotel lobby and crossing Sanya Bay Road, you will find the beach, which is very convenient. Second, the hotel environment is very good. There is a free swimming pool on the first floor for guests to use. The lobby on the first floor is transparent and the sea breeze blows very cool. Third, the hotel service is very good. I originally booked a 90-degree sea view room, but gave feedback to the hotel room manager that I could not see the entire Sanya Bay. The manager immediately upgraded it to a 180-degree sea view room for free. The balcony of the room faced the sea, with a wide view and a comfortable mood. Special thanks to the hotel room manager👍👍👍

Later, I heard from local friends in Sanya that this hotel has been open for a long time and has a certain reputation in Sanya. The check-in process was smooth and the location is very good. The person who greeted me at the front desk was Chen Qiumei, and her service attitude was great.
Facilities: The hotel has complete facilities and everything you need. Because there was no lighter just after getting off the plane, luckily there was a lighter in the room to solve the urgent need.

Hygiene: Hygiene is good, the room is very clean
Environment: The environment is excellent. There is a 180-degree sea view outside the window, and the view is very good and unobstructed. The picture shows the real shot on the 17th floor
Service: The hotel service is above the standard and exceeds expectations. There is no charge for parking at the entrance. There was a very good-looking lady named Yang at the front desk. She entered the wrong license plate for me the first time, and then helped me enter the license plate information again.

msg:I traveled to Sanya on 10.17. The front desk service of the hotel was very good. I also upgraded the room. I stayed on the 15th floor. The view was perfect. The appearance of the hotel was inconspicuous and the facilities were slightly old. However, it was very cost-effective and the location was very convenient. Just across the road was Coconut Beach. Dream Gallery, Sanya's largest Wanghao Supermarket is nearby, and the First Market is not far away either. These two days happened to be the landfall of Typhoon Sanba. It rained every day and it was inconvenient to travel. I wanted to check out some delicious food, such as Asan Soup, A Tree, Wenma Gangmen Noodles, Authentic Baoluo Noodles, and Grandma Zheng. The takeout was delivered and I sat on the balcony enjoying the scenery while eating delicious food. It gave me some comfort and I stayed for another two nights.
In addition, if you want to buy fruits in Sanya, try not to go to the first market. It is very confusing. There is a commercial street more than one kilometer away from the first market, the Hong Kong and China Fruit Street. The prices are very cheap, milk coconut is 5 yuan a piece, and custard apple is 18 yuan a pound. Guifei Mango costs 4 yuan per pound, which is more than half cheaper than the first market.

Service: From the moment we got off the bus to the room, there was a bellboy named Xiao Chen who helped deliver our luggage to the room. The front desk welcomed us warmly and we heard greetings every time we went out! Very kind.
Value for money: The price/performance ratio is really good. You can stay in a hotel with good environment and good service at a relatively cheap price. Really great! It's so close to the airport and the city, right next to the night market, and just across the road is the beach, haha!

There is also a small swimming pool and children's entertainment area, which should cater to people who bring their children to Sanya for walking. The breakfast is quite rich, so don't be picky about the taste. After all, for the price, it's enough to fill you up. The only thing we complained about was the aunt who disturbed the hygiene. Her face was not very good and she had a bad temper. During the past few days of our stay, if we wanted anything or service, we would coax the aunt and give her some if she was happy. It’s not easy for people, and this hotel is not a five-star hotel. There is really no need for people to smile at their guests. But if you coax the aunt and talk to her nicely, she will be reasonable and accommodating, such as giving her a few bottles of mineral water. Overall, it's okay. For a hotel at this price, you can see the hotel's efforts and sincerity.

It is strongly recommended to modify it. Because of this, the staff specifically explained this to us. Thank you.

msg:Sanya Bay is very affordable and cannot be too demanding. I am personally satisfied with the hotel I chose this time. I am an adult with two children. I chose a twin room. The two 1.2-meter beds are very big when combined. No matter how the children roll over, they will not worry about falling off. I also read a lot of reviews before booking the hotel. Some said that the construction site downstairs in the city view room was very noisy, and that the uncles and aunts downstairs would have morning exercises were also very noisy. Fortunately, I didn’t meet them. Is it because I live on a high floor? (15th floor) Those who have this problem can choose a higher floor! There is also the hotel's buffet breakfast, which is useless. We ate it for 6 days in a row. To be honest, it was a bit boring, because almost all the dishes were changed back and forth. Affected by the typhoon, the flight was canceled and changed, and the room was extended for one day, and the breakfast on the seventh day did not choose the hotel buffet. The main focus of this itinerary is to go shopping and eat, not to play attractions or events, so I only chose one hotel, which is also the most sensible choice. It is too much trouble to run around with children on such a hot day. There are also many delicious takeaways near the hotel. If you don't want to go out, you can try it. Not far from the hotel is a large supermarket, Wanghao Supermarket, which sells seafood and can also process it. All kinds of fruits, sushi, salmon, grilled eel... Tsk tsk tsk, I can't stand the temptation of delicious food, I gained 7 catties after playing for 8 days! ! ! There is also refreshing and cooling, and you must choose smoothies. There is also mango fried ice, fried with coconut milk, super delicious, mango lovers can't stop. There are also coconut jelly, Hainan noodles, coconut rice... You can also go to Hema Xiansheng, whose seafood processing fee is super super cheap. I didn't go to the online celebrity shop, I didn't go to coconut chicken or dolphin seafood. It’s a bit too much to write, but this trip is still very happy. Generally speaking, if you don’t follow the group, you are happy!

During peak hours like 9 o’clock, many empty dishes, fruits, and condiments were left unfilled. There was also a long queue for cooking noodles. A bad face. After not having anything to eat for two consecutive days, I had no choice but to take the initiative to go to the restaurant waiter, otherwise I would really go hungry.

msg:I came to Sanya again after three years, and I did not hesitate to stay in Shengyi for the first night. After all, the location and price are very close to the people. So facilities and services can not be too demanding. It’s not as hot as it was three years ago (no doorman service when you get off the bus). Although you are used to doing it yourself, it feels a little different. Unfortunately, there are no orchid crabs and three-point crabs in the evening buffet.

msg:I was a little apprehensive before checking in because I saw mixed reviews. But when we arrived, we were pleasantly surprised! The hotel staff is very enthusiastic and professional. Xiaoli at the front desk saw that we were bringing the elderly and children to check in for us in advance, and arranged for the luggage to be delivered to the room. The facilities are complete, and Xiao Ai is really a good helper for moving in. You don't need to use your hands during the whole process. The room is bright and spacious, hygienic and clean. The big sister in the room is enthusiastic and proactive. When I came back, I was very touched to see that the clothes were neatly folded for us. The breakfast is very good, with a variety of categories, we are very satisfied with the elderly and children. The water in the swimming pool is clear and bright, and it is divided into 3 areas to meet people with different needs, and it is very fun to play. Opposite the swimming pool is the beach, and the little friends are very happy digging the sand and riding the waves. The traffic around the hotel is convenient for eating. There is a bus downstairs. We take the bus to some scenic spots, so that the children can experience life. The view of the sea is better from the tall car. All the buses on the island are super fast. Ha ha. Our two families have a very good experience staying in Shengyi this time. The children and the elderly all live very comfortably. Affected by the typhoon two days ago this time, it was very cool, and it was a summer vacation~ It was perfect!

The location of the hotel is very good, opposite to the beach, directly behind is the night market, as well as shopping malls and supermarkets. It's just so convenient. I originally booked a 180-degree sea view room on the 5th-7th floor. The lady at the front desk upgraded it to the 8th floor for free. The room has a large view and a good view, and the breakfast is also very good. I stayed for the last night before leaving. I went to the nearby night market at night, ate seafood, and went to the supermarket to buy special products. After staying in Sanya for six days, I regret not staying in this hotel earlier. Already recommended to friends who will come again✌️

If it weren’t for the swimming pool in the hotel, I would not have stayed there. I only went there to let the children swim. I thought the service attitude would be better if the price was expensive. The result may be because the business is better and the service attitude at the front desk is really bad The environment is also good, and the service attitude is very friendly. Overall, everything else is okay, but the service attitude is not good, and check-in is slow

I have been an old user of Ctrip for more than 10 years. This hotel is located on the coast of Sanya, with convenient transportation. The sea view is very good downstairs. There are all kinds of food near the building. It is very convenient to go anywhere. The breakfast at the hotel is very good. There are coffee (coffee beans, not instant) Western food and Chinese food (big chicken legs 🍗 eat whatever you want), and the fruit is very sweet. There is a Starbucks in the hotel lobby.

In short, now I often go abroad for various activities, and I don't have the time and energy to evaluate a hotel that is not impressive. I won't comment on a hotel with average service. I highly recommend this hotel to everyone. Super cost-effective, convenient transportation, downtown, coastal sea view room, delicious Chinese and Western breakfasts are all available. Absolute five-star service, home away from home.

msg:The hotel is resort standard, meaning no star rating. The overall feeling of staying is still insufficient. First of all, I renewed the room on top of the machine wine package. The city view room I booked at the beginning did not have a sea view, and the parking lot downstairs was noisy in the morning, and there was still the sound of the machine working; sea view room. After I checked in, I felt that the hotel calculated the cost to the extreme every minute. For example, the lights in the room were on the side near the balcony, and the switch at the door did not light up; the linen was only provided by the hotel at that time. Yes; and the bathtub switch in the bathroom is broken. Fortunately, I brought my own bath bag to use it; even the bottled water is "limited" to two bottles per day. Because the weather is hot and there are many mosquitoes in the room, you have to close the door and turn on the air conditioner when you light the mosquito coils, which feels a bit stuffy.
The hotel's breakfast is on the first floor, and the first-day machine wine package is provided as a gift. The quality meets the standards of a resort hotel, but I personally think it is average. In terms of room hygiene, the customer service is cleaned every day and replaced with new linen. Because I saw an adverti*****t in the elevator downstairs that you can enjoy a buffet discount when you stay in a hotel, but I called to ask the restaurant in the past and didn’t give a discount. The price of the buffet is 288 yuan, 388 yuan and 568 yuan, and there is a limited amount of seafood. I didn't think it was worth it, so I went out to eat. The bar downstairs stops until the early hours of the night.
The hotel is located on Jixiang Street. Opposite is a food street, and there are also specialty shops. The cosmetics in the specialty shop downstairs are really cheap, and the fruit is also good. The swimming pool on the first floor is a bit small, with a depth of only 1.5 meters and 1.2 meters, which can be used by staying guests. Opposite the hotel is the sea view of Sanya Bay. You can go to step on the waves and sand.
Overall comment: 4.5 points for resort hotels, 3.5 points for star hotels. For example, I found out that the facilities of the nearby hotels with the same price are much better than his.

Generally speaking, the hotel room is a bit old, but the location is really first-class, facing the sea view, behind is the newly opened night market, and it is also very close to the shopping mall. Overall, it is worthy of the price, and the price performance ratio is very high!

Not long after we checked into the room, Manager Liang from the front office of the hotel called me specifically to inquire about my experience so that they could improve their service. When he heard that I couldn't be upgraded to a sea view room with a little regret, he asked me to wait a while to see if the hotel might work harder to help me. This kind of service attitude that really cares about customers and the enthusiasm and sincerity are really heartwarming! On the second day, they really helped me change to a 180-degree super beautiful sea view room! Here I would like to give a big thumbs up to Manager Liang of the Front Office Depar**ent of Shengyi Hotel! Thank you Shengyi Hotel!

After arriving at the hotel, my little brother saw us 4 adults and 3 babies. He took the initiative to upgrade the suite for us enthusiastically. The service attitude is definitely nothing to say , The room is spacious and hygienic. The children jump happily on the bed when they enter the room. The cleaning lady cleans up the room and puts children's bathrobes for us. It is very heartwarming. I also enjoy a free cup of Starbucks every day. The main room has a 180-degree sea view. Children It's really convenient to go directly to the beach after crossing the road. The little brother also offered to provide children's toys so that they can go to the beach to play with sand. It's really thoughtful. I highly recommend it 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻, and it's located in Haiyue, Sanya Bay Next to the square, the traffic is very convenient. I plan to book here in the future. The elderly are also very satisfied with the accommodation conditions this time. I recommend you to find my little brother Ken directly🤭

There is a tea room on the fourth floor, which is very elegant, suitable for chatting and working, and there are literary "little feelings" everywhere. The small details that can be seen everywhere in the hotel reflect the sense of service of "feelings, love, and caring". In particular, I would like to praise Miss Qin, the cleaning lady on the 13th floor. She is very careful. Because she has a baby, she cleans it very well. She also thoughtfully prepared a drying rack. I have stayed in many hotels in Sanya. This hotel is very comprehensive and has a good experience. I have lived here for more than half a month, and I am very satisfied. The only downside is that the big sister who cleaned up the breakfast made the plates and dishes jingling before the guests finished eating, and was still spraying cleaning fluid. The noise was too loud and the service was not good.

The front office service of Shengyi Hotel is fast, professional, and enthusiastic, especially the handsome manager Liang of the front office, who is impressive. He is a professional hotel management talent. Like it! The other Aunt Liao (Liao Xiuzhong, maybe the name is wrong) who cleans the room, cleans well and has a warm attitude, praise!

msg:Shengyi Hotel, maybe the big boss likes it? The decoration of the room is obviously going in the dark and old direction, which can also be called the traditional direction. The external materials in the room seem to be red wood products, the floor is black bricks, and the bathroom is marble bricks, which is inconsistent with the current light and bright decoration. Well, it looks like the picture on the website, it feels dark and oppressive. I also thought about it for a long time before moving in. However, after living in it, I found that there was no such feeling at all, it was all comfortable. A hotel like this that does not open beauty photos is worthy of praise. Unlike many hotels on the second floor, rooms are only on the 5th or 6th floor in Shengyi, so the room is not damp, and the bathroom really has no smell. The room hygiene must be higher than the standard of home hygiene, and it is very good. Just one thing, who designed the position of the toilet and the door? If someone is sitting on the toilet and pushes the door of the bathroom, they will be hit on the head. Or try it, change the door to open on the right.
A hotel, as long as the most basic hygiene is done well, it is a hotel with a passing line. Everything else is a plus. But if you don't do a good job in hygiene, you can only treat it as a stepping on thunder. The sanitation of Shengyi Hotel is good.
Let's talk about extra points.
One is service service service. The staff smiles all the way, and it can be felt that it is definitely not the formulaic kind. During the stay, they also call back to see if there is any need. Oh, I need to mention that there is a very young receptionist in the lobby. He didn’t have time to intervene because I was carrying the luggage by myself, and he gave me a disappointed expression. I quickly comforted him and said that I would do it myself. I will definitely ask you for help. Really, from here I can especially feel that the hotel's service training is really at home.
Second, it is convenient to eat and drink. The hotel has its own catering, and I didn’t eat the hotel’s meals because I was too shy, but the smell was delicious when I entered and exited the elevator during the meal😊 The hotel lobby is facing the Tianya Night Market. Although there are not many types of food, it is newly opened after all. Yes, it should be fine in the future. It will be more convenient to live and eat here.
Third, it is close to the sea. Go out from the swimming pool and just cross the road. It is convenient to take a rest when you are tired from playing.

The only thing that can be recognized is the service! There were a lot of bad episodes that were solved by the assistant manager in the lobby. The reason why I didn't complain was because of the assistant manager's good attitude! The outdoor breakfast on the first floor is so smelly that I can hardly breathe, and there are big rats. The Chinese food on the second floor is very Northeast, and the decoration is also shabby, and the products are not satisfactory!

Special thanks to Lu Jianli, the front desk supervisor, who is very warm and considerate. Every time I go to her, I will help you solve any problems. At first, the city view room faced a construction site. When I got up late and went out at night, I felt a little noisy. Partial view of the sea, thank you very much.
In the middle of the journey, there was a situation where the TV tuner couldn’t figure it out and couldn’t open it, and the room card was lost. Every time I called the front desk, I sent someone to solve it as soon as possible. It’s very good👍🏻
The most important thing about this hotel is the convenient location. In Sanya Bay, just across the road is the sea
Another important reason is that the breakfast is rich, the dishes are rich, and the taste is delicious, especially the Hainan noodles. I have to eat a bowl every morning.

msg:On the last night before the end of the trip, it is adjacent to Sanya Bay and separated from the beach all the way. The hotel in the urban area has convenient transportation, but it is a bit noisy. There are planes and sightseeing helicopters every once in a while. But the advantage is that it is convenient to go anywhere. There is a big night market behind the hotel with a lot of things. It is really convenient to eat and buy fruits. The hotel facilities are generally hygienic, but compared to the price, it is not bad, and there is breakfast in the morning. The staff of the hotel are quite enthusiastic, and Xiao Zhuo's service attitude is very good, which is worthy of praise. Next time you travel, you can still consider staying again

Seafood barbecue buffet dinner for one person: It is especially recommended that there is a seafood buffet on the first floor of the hotel. You can eat abalone, oysters, crabs and shrimps. As long as you can eat, the price is affordable. It is much more cost-effective than in the seafood market.
Breakfast: also delicious

There is also a swimming pool in the hotel. The room is relatively small, the facilities are relatively new, and the complete Sanya Bay can be seen through the window.
However, the air conditioner in the room and the helicopter outside the window are relatively loud, which is one of the few shortcomings except that the room size is relatively small.
The front desk service is very enthusiastic. I was not satisfied with the location of the room at the beginning and immediately dealt with it. I forgot my ID card at the front desk and immediately returned it to me.
Generally speaking, it is a compromise between playing on the beach and watching the sea.

A few minutes walk to the beach, there are many buses, it is very convenient to get there. Second, the service is attentive. The room service at the front desk is very friendly. The lobby manager also gave free breakfast and airport drop-off service. I especially like the plum juice provided by the front desk, which injected a hint of coolness for us who were already sweating profusely. Third, the scenery is beautiful. You can see the sea almost every step of the way, the lobby can look at the sea, open the door, the sea is right in front of you, the field of vision is very wide, you can see the whole sea area, the sky, the sea, the coconut grove, and the beach are beautiful! A few suggestions. First, the parent-child suite is more suitable for young children. It is too cute for teenage minors (especially boys). You can make some adjus**ents according to age and gender. Second, a soft partition can be added between the bathroom and the bed. After all, not everyone is adapted to this open form.

From picking up our luggage🧳 to check-in and then to the duty-free shop shuttle bus, Ken was very good and quickly helped us deal with it. Thank you so much for such a great experience. Besides the hotel, the safety of the swimming pool is very high, and there are 2 security guards ready at any time. The swimming pool has a deep water area and a shallow water area, which can fully meet the needs of beginners and experienced players. The swimming pool can also rent lifebuoys 🛟 and towels for free, which is very convenient. The distance from the hotel to the beach is also very close. The surrounding shops are also very convenient to eat and there are many options for takeaways. The buffet on the first floor of the hotel is also worth looking forward to. In addition, the sunset overlooking Sanya Bay from the room is the most beautiful, but you can fully see the whole picture of the sunset and the west mountain. The only downside is the hotel's breakfast. The coaxing bread machine can be upgraded. It can only be baked on one side and one piece and the power is low. It takes a long time to bake a perfect bread...

msg:It must be a 5-point praise. This time I went to Sanya to stay in high-end five-star hotels such as Sheraton and medclub, but from the beginning of booking to the last check-out, Shengyi is the cheapest hotel with the best service experience. The lady at the front desk was very patient. After arriving at the store, the lady at the front desk saw that we brought the elderly and children and took the initiative to help us upgrade the room to a 180-degree sea view room on the high floor. The hotel has a swimming pool, and there is a telephone return visit in the middle. She helped us refrigerate. Before leaving, I knew that our flight at night offered to take us to the airport for free. The girls and brothers at the front desk all smiled throughout the whole process. The service quality really kills many high-star hotels. The only downside is the air conditioning in the room. A bit aging, the sound is a bit loud at night, I hope it can be improved when I go to stay next time

After check-in, the hotel did call to make a return visit and offered to upgrade my room, but I was outside and didn't change it. After all, I am also a Ctrip Black Diamond user, and the check-in experience this time was very general. Picture 1/2 below is my room, the so-called 90-degree sea view room. I really like the transparent design of the hotel lobby, which is very regional. It is said that the buffet dinner here is also good, and there is a chance to try it.

The hardware facilities of the hotel and the service of the staff are very good. Check-in, rich buffet breakfast, half-way telephone interviews, Aunt Wu Xuehua who provided free disposable toilet mats and left a warm note, and luggage storage at the end of the store, all of which are not inferior to hotels with more than 1,000 yuan, regret before Didn't find it here a few times.

I would also like to like the waitress on the 5th floor where we live. A tall girl with short hair and perm helped us make the bed seamless, with quick movements, good attitude and responsiveness.
The hotel breakfast is good, with a lot of variety. The children in the hotel pool had a great time.

There is also a matching swimming pool. The dining experience is also very nice.

Sure enough, it is an old-fashioned hotel. I will stay again next time~

msg:The location of the hotel is good. It’s the Sanya Bay Beach just across the street. I stayed on a business trip in 2010 and I have a good impression. I came across this vacation and bought a package for 1299 yuan during a hotel event. I stayed in the 180-degree ocean view room on the 12th floor and was right on the balcony. It's great to be able to watch the sunset, 3 nights plus three-day breakfast for two, one-time buffet seafood dinner for two, airport drop-off, etc., very cost-effective! This stay is generally very good, although the room facilities are a bit old, but the service attitude is very good, whether it is at the front desk or in the guest room, special thanks to Xiao Tan, very caring! Another point is that the opposite side of the building is a bit noisy. The old migratory birds have been active since 6:30 in the morning, but compared to the beautiful scenery and the food they enjoy, they can be overcome. One more thing, the transportation is convenient, there are multiple buses at the door and around, you can go anywhere.

Because I brought the elderly and children, I booked two rooms, both of which included a double breakfast buffet. Only on the first day, on August 8, the buffet breakfast was served. The hotel later changed it to the one shown in the picture on the grounds that it was necessary for epidemic prevention and to avoid crowds gathering. But may I ask, what is the difference between eating here and eating in a cafeteria? Oh, the difference is that the amount is less, you can buy your breakfast if you don't have enough to eat. Is it right? ! This kind of cost-saving rhetoric of yours is simply insulting everyone's IQ! Do you think this is worthy of your status as a five-star hotel? Not even a glass of milk or eggs for breakfast, it's not that there is no set menu, you can buy it if you want! Junk hotel!

msg:Very old hotel, for the convenience of getting to the airport, but in fact it is not very close, nearly half an hour by car. There is a big gap from Haitang Bay. And when the hotel went upstairs without swiping the room card, someone knocked on the door in the middle of the night, scared to death! There was a problem with the room given to me before, a huge tide. Later, I went to the Ctrip Coordination Hotel to change my room and it was not bad.

Sea view room is still very cost-effective other room types don't live! What I saw was a rubble construction site

The hotel has easy parking and the beach or swimming pool is also available. The breakfast is pretty plentiful, but it’s not cost-effective to extend it earlier, the buffet is not cost-effective

msg:I was very impressed by this trip and accommodation. Shengyi is the first choice for my friends to stay in Sanya many times. At that time, I slightly disliked it as a bit old, but for the convenience of traveling together, I finally chose it. Facts have proved that there is no wrong choice. First of all, the price is considered to be very cost-effective among many Sanya sea view hotels. Except for the regret that the hotel has been under construction, but most of the time during the day, I go out to play, and the sliding doors are closed. The noise is also low. There is not much left, so the noise problem will not be discussed again. Secondly, I was touched by the attentiveness and care of the staff. If there is no disposable toilet pad, I left a message as a gift. I found that there was no water in the kettle and boiled it in advance. I reminded that I can drink warm water when I came back. When I saw the mango I bought, I left a message with a fruit knife, which is convenient for cutting fruits. On the birthday, the hotel took the initiative to present cakes. Before we left, because we were afraid that we would not be able to have breakfast in order to catch a plane, I asked if we need to pack breakfast... Various details are rarely encountered during my previous stay. The details determine the quality, and the quality makes up for the shortcomings. If I come again next time, I should choose here again, thanks

It is not blocked. You can sit on the balcony to eat and watch the sunset. The balcony can also hang clothes. Very convenient, you can bring a few portable hangers; the room has night lights, which I am satisfied with, it is convenient for the elderly; the water in the swimming pool is also very clean; the breakfast is good, 48 is okay after the early discount, the original price is expensive; the hotel You can reserve a bus to the duty-free shop. I especially praise the hotel staff for "He Kaiyin". Seeing that we mentioned fruit, we put a fruit knife specially, very attentive and thoughtful. I will choose again when I have the opportunity to come to Hainan!

msg:I originally booked a room with a 90-degree view. When I got to the room, there was construction going on all day and night. I asked the front desk to help me change the room and told them that I needed to pay extra for an upgrade. I upgraded according to their wishes and paid an additional 150 per night. Ctrip checked The total cost was just over 300 yuan. The set meal we ordered included lunch. Because we arrived late, we asked the front desk if we could change it to dinner. The front desk said we could pay the difference of 100 yuan. However, when we went to the restaurant, we were told that we had to pay 150 yuan per person. Suddenly we felt that we were staying in. A black shop? Give as much as you want? I booked a room for two nights and received lunch for two days. On the first day, I changed it to dinner and spent more than an hour to have the meal. The second time I went, I was told that the lunch coupon could not be used, and I was asked to contact Ctrip customer service again. Let me contact the hotel customer service. Aren't you all connected to the Internet? All these require customers to contact your staff to find out what they want! When I left, I was told that I needed to make a reservation by phone one day in advance to use the coupon. Why didn't you tell me on the first day that you were bullying us? We checked out at one o'clock in the afternoon. When we arrived at another hotel at three o'clock, the facial recognition message was still there and we had not checked out at the previous hotel. We could only call to urge us, which was a very poor experience! The housing deposit was said to be returned the same way in the early morning of the next day after checking out on the same day, but unfortunately it was not refunded! I really can’t complain! Maybe your hotel doesn’t care about us individual travelers, but we still remind everyone to avoid stepping on the trap!

msg:這個酒店我特別滿意！
確實設施有些舊 但是它便宜！跟那些動輒幾千的酒店比真的超值！而且該有的設施它也都有，很不錯。
我最滿意的是房間的名字 180度海景房 言簡意賅 其他酒店都是各種花裏胡哨的名字就是不説到底是不是正面看海 這個題目就有 非常節省時間。
而且確實是180度正面看海 我就是衝著海去的 所以我特別滿意！
前台特別好 熱情耐心 還提供了周邊的遊玩訊息 員工都在問住店滿意嗎 感覺大家都對酒店的口碑很上心。
酒店離沙灘特別近 出去過馬路就是很方便。衹是晚上和週末會有大爺大媽唱歌跳廣場舞。不過關上窗户就好多了。
酒店後面有新開的夜市，這次沒去吃，但溜達了一下感覺應該也不錯。
如果追求性價比，追求海景，這裏真的超合適！

На ресепшене работает англоговорящий администратор, знает немного русских слов.
Номера большие, в номере есть все необходимое. Вода предоставляется каждый день. При необходимости можно необходимое количество попросить на ресепшене или у уборщицы (со временем в номер ставят большее количество).
Завтрак азиатский, для европейца можно найти много привычной еды.
Для тех кто любит лакшари стоит обратить внимание на год постройки отеля. Так как не во всех номерах прошло обновление. 
За отелем находится ночной рынок.
Море через дорогу, лежаки только у бассейна.

msg:三亞灣地理位置方便，出門就是海邊，快樂的很，
設施:全屋智能，有機器人幫忙送外賣，也有外賣自提櫃，很方便。一樓配有泳池，有專業救生員，臨時儲物櫃，免費游泳圈，沖涼，衞生間，健身房等等。房間配的沉香沐浴露和洗髮露很好用，不光是味道好聞，洗完頭髮還真就是亮潤有光澤的，好評。
衞生:保潔姐姐人很熱情，我們選好房間之後快速打掃乾淨，很專業。看我們房間裏有沒打開的水果，貼心的給準備了一把水果刀，太感動了，我們在附近溜達的時候偶遇了下班的她，也認出我們了，主動打招呼，感覺超級温暖，平時一定是個很有愛的人。
環境:酒店環境乾淨整潔，空氣清新，房間180度面朝大海，第一天住了，第二天換了一個地方，新地方對比之下簡直太差了，第三天趕緊換回來了，住在這都捨不得走了。
服務:沒説的，各個環節都非常貼心。工作人員會隨時詢問是否有需要幫助的，有需要改進的，真的很不錯。
星巴克咖啡:如約贈送了咖啡，品類很多可以自選，我們喝的是拿鐵瑪奇朵和卡布奇諾，製作咖啡的小哥哥很專業，詢問了口味，也給出了靠譜的建議，咖啡很好喝。
另外，海鮮自助吃了兩天，有每人一衹蒜蓉小青龍（提前做好的）和小米魚翅羹。很不錯，食材新鮮，可選擇性多，清蒸海鮮和三味綜合的火鍋都嘗試了，不錯。

msg:總體還算不錯吧。有一點小小問題：要如廁時發現衞生間馬桶墊上有黑色東西，本想自己用衞生紙擦一下，發現有點粘，於是通知大堂讓服務員過來處理一下。過了一會服務員過來説都打掃過了，沒有問題，我讓她看看馬桶墊上的黑色，她説弄不掉是膠，我説弄不掉就換房間，這才找來東西給擦掉了。問有沒有一次性坐圈套，説是沒有後來給找來了一個。
對於這種服務我覺得不應該出現，望酒店管理方應加強管理。

msg:攜程上訂好的房間￼，入住的是該酒店7樓￼，因為到酒店早，上午11:00左右酒店就給我們入住了，￼房間內可以看海，因為房間樓層低，裝修有點舊，距三亞灣海邊大概衹有100米左右，比較潮濕￼，酒店經理主動為我升級到了14樓￼，這個房間是新裝修的樓層裏乾淨乾燥，￼可以看到更廣貌的三亞灣￼。這個酒店就位於三亞￼灣海邊，地下室停車不曬、方便，泳池也不錯，早餐和環境還算可以，酒店二樓有個吃早餐的粵式茶餐廳，場子比較大，看到許多本地人和遊客休閑地喝茶吃點心￼看大屏幕的新聞￼。該酒店也是政府會議定點點。感覺這個酒店環境舒適、人氣旺，風水蠻好！

唯一有點困擾的是馬路對面廣場舞和唱歌的噪聲擾人，一整天不休息，9樓關窗好一些。

但是酒店的衞生間設計是很不專業的，即使有很大的空間，也沒有以人為本來考慮。希望下次翻修的時候能夠改變。
當然，酒店的地理位置優越，寬大的陽台提供了良好的視野，美麗的三亞灣盡收眼底。因此，酒店的價格比較貴，應該説性價比不高。
酒店的早餐比較豐富，也可口。
酒店有相當多的地下停車位。

酒店自帶三個區域的游泳池，小朋友那個泳池配有滑滑梯，水温也會比大人的泳池高一些，感覺像温泉一樣，孩子絕對不會凍着，實在是太貼心了～
