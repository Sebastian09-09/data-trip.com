msg:Our stay at snow mountain ice spring was amazing! We only spent 2 nights here and our entire itinerary was well organised by Ba San who helped us view all the major Bala Gezong scenic areas. Our transportation to and from the hotel and Shangrila station was also organised by the hotel staff, leading to a very well planned stay. The accommodation itself is huge and very comfortable and cosy, and the breakfast provided was so grand. Complimentary tickets for some activities was also provided, making this booking so value for money. While this hotel may be pricier than others, it is definitely very worth it and in our opinion, the only option you should consider for the Bala Gezong area.

msg:Bala Gezong is indeed the secret place of Shangri-La. From the road leading to the scenic spot, you can enjoy the clear and turbulent stream. After going up the mountain, you can enjoy the panoramic view of the canyon with a drop of more than 800 meters. The hotel's room rate of 888 includes the scenic spot ticket and the car to the scenic spot. It happened to be the off-season when we went there. As soon as we arrived, the hotel housekeeper Jiangba Jiangcai arranged our two-day tour itinerary. Then Duozhu Dingzhu accompanied us for more than 3 hours to visit the Echo Wall, Bala Village and other tourist attractions included in the hotel package. On the second day, the tour guide Shan Zeng and the driver Losang Pincuo led us to visit the natural pagoda and felt the ethereal realm that was infinitely close to the blue sky. Here we express our gratitude.
Of course, what impressed me more in Balagezong this time was Mr. Sina Dingzhu, who built this road. When he was 11 years old, he was burned in the eye by the sparks from the burning iron while forging iron. However, because there was no road to get out of the mountains to the city, he missed the best time to treat his eyes and became permanently blind in one eye. Therefore, building a road to Bala Village became Sina's ideal since he was a teenager. For this ideal, Sina lived in the wild for two years and measured and explored the route of the road with his own feet. For this ideal, he spent his 30 years of savings and even encountered a landslide when the road was built for 14 kilometers. The newly built road and engineering machinery were destroyed, but it did not shake his belief in building roads. Sina mortgaged all his belongings to the bank and finally built this road to Bala Village. Today, the indigenous people of Bala Village have moved to the foot of the mountain through this road. Tourists are also fortunate to see the secrets of Balagezong because of this road. Walking on this road, each of us will feel the power of faith, just like Gaudi spent his life to build the Sagrada Familia. As long as a person has a firm belief, no matter how many failures he experiences, God will eventually favor those who are determined.

When you open the window in the hotel room, you can see the endless green and the boundless blue sky, which makes people feel relaxed and happy. The environmental advantages of the hotel inside the scenic area are fully demonstrated. The service of the front desk guy is warm and thoughtful, helping us plan the itinerary in the scenic area, and it is very comfortable to play.
Next time I have the opportunity to come and play again, I will definitely choose to stay.

msg:I drove here for two days during the May Day holiday. Overall, I was very satisfied and it is worth recommending.

üìåTransportation:
The Eighteen Bends of the Heavenly Road is not enough to describe it. Even an experienced driver like me has to be careful and concentrate when driving an off-road vehicle; the road to the pagoda can only be driven by the driver of the scenic area, and I dare not drive up by myself;

üìåMy own feelings about the problems complained about online:
‚ë† After walking through the "Heavenly Road" of the entire scenic area (especially to the pagoda), you will know how much manpower and material resources it takes to build such a heavenly road. It is really not easy to transport materials to build such a high-end scenic area (I admire the boss of Dingzhu even more);

‚ë° The scenic area has such a long mountain road, and the scenic spots are far apart, it is really not suitable "One-day tour", I vomited in the car in one day (especially those who departed from Shangri-La and returned on the same day), so how could I have the heart to see the scenery; this scenic spot is really not suitable for special forces who travel back and forth on the same day;

‚ë¢ If you really want to come, it is recommended to stay for one night (or two nights), the scenic area fee is included in the room fee; it is actually not bad for two people together;

üìåHardware:
The hotel has nothing to say about the architectural style, room area, facilities, and surrounding environment; the room air conditioning warm air is warm enough, and there is enough hot water 24 hours a day; there is also warm air on the top of the shower; humidifier is standard; it is very suitable for vacation.

üìåSoftware:
‚ë† The waiters are well trained, and various problems are handled very quickly and effectively.
‚ë°Food: I can only say that the food here is really not suitable for us Cantonese people;

üìåRegret:
It was foggy on the day of climbing the pagoda, and it was snowing heavily after climbing up. The visibility was less than 50 meters, and I didn‚Äôt know where the natural pagoda was; but for us Cantonese people, although it was a pity, we also saw such a heavy snow. When you go out, relax your mind.

msg:At the end of April, we had the honor to stay at the Balagezong Ice Spring Hotel and experience the Shangri-La style for two days and one night. The Balagezong scenic area, with its vast natural landscape and profound cultural heritage, adds a lot of color to our trip. First of all, the natural landscape of Balagezong is shocking. As a representative of snow-capped mountains, the Shambhala Pagoda is not only covered with heavy snow, but also its combination with ******* Buddhism gives people a sacred and solemn feeling. The snow-capped mountain scenery along the way is even more refreshing, as if you are in a fairyland on earth. Canyon rafting is an exciting experience. We feel the power and beauty of nature while rushing forward in the rapids. The tranquility and beauty of Bala Village allow us to appreciate the magnificence of Gezong Snow Mountain up close. The natural scenery here complements the cultural landscape of the ******* village, forming a moving picture. It is particularly worth mentioning that the coffee house in Bala Village not only provides a comfortable resting place, but also has a first-class landscape, allowing people to enjoy the picturesque scenery while tasting coffee. The hotel's pick-up service from Shangri-La to the scenic spot is very thoughtful. The driver, Master Suonan, is not only skilled in driving, but also introduced to us the touching story of Mr. Wang's loan for road construction on the way, which gave us a deeper understanding and affection for this land. The bonfire party in the evening, the simplicity and enthusiasm of the ******* compatriots, made us feel the warmth of home. Although the entire scenic area is hardcore, it is not seriously commercialized, and more natural and original features are retained, which is undoubtedly a great blessing for travelers who pursue nature and tranquility. The service of the Bala Gezong Ice Spring Hotel is also first-class. From check-in to check-out, every detail reflects the hotel's professionalism and thoughtfulness. For friends who want to have a deeper understanding of ******* culture and enjoy the natural beauty, I strongly recommend the Bala Gezong Ice Spring Hotel and Scenic Area. Staying here for one night will give you a comfortable and unforgettable travel experience.

Along the way, we passed through the mountain road with eighteen bends and saw the scenery from every corner. When we arrived at the hotel, the hotel staff was very enthusiastic. They helped us move our luggage and explained the things to do. Since we arrived late, we couldn't see the attractions on the mountain, so we wandered around and passed by the front desk and chatted with the ******* boy Tenzin. We talked about the history of Balagzong and many other things. He enthusiastically introduced us to many local ways of playing and his service was also very enthusiastic. When we were playing on the second day, the scenery of the entire scenic area was extremely magnificent. This is really a place worth visiting more often. Thumbs up for Balagzong

The best thing is to play in the snow at the pagoda this season. It is so beautiful. If you have experienced the mountains of Meili and the grasslands of Shangri-La, then you must not miss this comfortable ancient village with a history of 1,300 years and the scenery here. ******* people‚Äôs touching stories about road construction. The snow at the pagoda is thick and white, and the transportation is very convenient. It is only an hour away from the city. The hotel has complete supporting services. If you check in directly, the butler will arrange the itinerary. Special thanks to our housekeeper, brother Xiao Yu. We, a native of Yunnan, are honest, kind and sincere in their service, which makes our family feel warm. The food in the restaurant is very refreshing and delicious, and any fried rice is cooked with sincerity. Great place, will come back with my family.

Environment: The surrounding environment is good. It is worth staying for one night. It is a slow-paced experience. It feels good to fly a drone in the mountains and canyons. If it is just a day trip, the mountains are too high and the canyons are too deep. You cannot experience the mountains and rivers here without rafting.
Service: The service butler has a good service attitude and the itinerary is reasonably arranged.
The price includes tickets to scenic spots, a high-altitude shuttle, a half-day tour of Shambhala Pagoda, and a breakfast for the kids. We live in Kunming, and the altitude of 3,000-4,300 meters here still gives me a headache. Did I take a shower? It is recommended not to take a bath within two days after arriving at Shangri-La. The price is a little higher during National Day, but it is worth it because of the many gifts!

msg:Balagezong has always been a place with mixed reviews. I have been to Shangri-La and Meili several times, but I always passed by but never went in. This time I came to Meili again on November 1st. Because I brought my baby with me and I have always been obsessed with Balagezong (mainly because I watched the story about road construction in the readers of CCTV), I chose to stay in the scenic spot for a better experience. . After giving up, I feel that it is really... too commercial! More commercial than Shangri-La! I probably won‚Äôt go there again... Let‚Äôs talk about the hotel. There are two in the scenic area, because the shuttle bus passes by, the location of the miracle will have better scenery, directly facing the cliff. The accommodation environment in Xueshan Bingquan is better, the equipment is new and the rooms are large. The hotel gives away two tickets and a rafting/ropeway ticket. It is emphasized that children above 1.2 meters are required to pay admission tickets and bus tickets! ! In addition, giving an amu*****t ticket is obviously to stimulate consumption, because another person can also play üôÉThe ropeway and rafting are both 120 per person. Let me emphasize that if the price exceeds 120 even a little bit, the full ticket will be 120! There is no place to eat near the hotel, so you can only eat at the restaurant (or bring your own). The canteen only offers simple drinks and no food. The housekeeper will ask you about your itinerary for the next day in advance (you need to arrange a car). The 18-turn road to the hotel mountain road is also relatively narrow, and it is very easy to meet the shuttle bus, so if you are not good at driving, please be careful, and be sure not to drive too fast. In short, if you are obsessed with this attraction, I suggest you stay there for one night. . .

But no one asked me about my luggage during the whole journey. I came out and saw a staff member and asked about the luggage. I need to find someone to deliver them to her. She was very impatient. She was eating melon seeds and asked if there were too many. I said there were too many. She said she was very impatient and called someone to come. Two people asked me where I lived.

There is also a housekeeper to help you plan your itinerary. If you want to play It is easy to live in Bingquan. You can only eat in the dining room of Bingquan, and the price is more expensive. The cableway and rafting cost 120 for a trip, which is a bit expensive. We arrived after 11 o'clock. After lunch, the butler arranged a car to take us to the meeting point of the soundproof wall after 1 o'clock. First, we will see Bala Foshan by car, and then play with the soundproof wall when we come back. Lacun, play the Grand Canyon the next day.

The bath bag provided in the room is also very useful, and the children like it very much. The food in the restaurant is also good, delicious and the price is right. Zipline, speedboat, rafting, if time permits, it is recommended to play, it is very fun. It's just that the time is too short this time, and I'm a bit unfulfilled. Next time, I will stay for a few more days! Haha~ The scenery is beautiful, the story is moving, and the service is good. Balagozon is great! ! !

First of all, the location of the hotel is very good. In the scenic area, you can send tickets to Balagezong, and you can drive into the scenic area by yourself. Then the hotel will arrange a free tour guide to charter a car to take us to play, and also send tickets for rafting or cableway. The room is super large and very It is warm and has all kinds of facilities. It can be said that the problems mentioned in the bad reviews have completely disappeared now! This price, this experience, is top among all scenic spots in Northwest Yunnan!
The second is the level of the hotel staff, which gives people a very good feeling, and it is not bad compared to first- and second-tier famous brand hotels! The most important of these is to treat guests with enthusiasm and sincerity! The younger brother in the hotel will patiently explain the tour route and precautions, and the younger sister in the restaurant will also explain how each dish is. Including the staff of various scenic spots, I realized the cuteness of ******* compatriots.
Finally, the story of Sina Dingzhu moved me! From the 214 National Highway to the Shambhala Pagoda, the whole road condition is very good, the road is wide and flat, and the signs are clear!
Will definitely come back in the future! In mid-February, you can go deep into the snow mountain to play, and there are not many tourists. I hope that the construction of Balagezong will get better and better, and there will be more and more. This is the best gift for the brave!

Inside the scenic spot
I am speechless at this scenic spot
Not to mention it‚Äôs far away from Shangri-La
It takes dozens of minutes to open the gate to the scenic spot.
There are not many scenic spots on such a long road
If it rains, there won't be any activities.
Complain about the so-called butler service
Service must be intentional
Service staff like Banyan Tree and Indy
When I see the guest coming back from a distance, I wait with an umbrella in hand.
And the service staff of this restaurant were holding umbrellas and watching the guests running into the lobby.
Service quality cannot be solved by giving a bowl of chicken soup and a bag of milk before going to bed.
I will never be fooled by this kind of hotel again.
There is no so-called monkey that can see

Canyon Park experiences an altitude difference of 2,000 meters in one day and appreciates a completely different natural scenery.
The hotel is on the mountainside, with good scenery, large rooms and good decoration. All servers are friendly and attentive.
1-to-1 butler reception, guided tour, special thanks to the butler Jiangba Jiangcai for his full service and explanation of customs.
The pick-up and drop-off package is very cost-effective, and I will definitely choose this one in the future

In the early morning in the forest, you can hear the birds chirping, relax your body and mind, and return to nature. The hotel is equipped with a butler, with meticulous and thoughtful service, who will plan your itinerary throughout the process. During the journey, I heard the founder's entrepreneurial story and the story of road construction, which is admirable. It's a place worth visiting again.

The wooden floor makes a sound as soon as you step on it, there is no disposable toilet cover, the wood on the bed is far from the wall, and the temperature in the living room never rises, just like the two seasons in the bedroom! The housekeeper intervenes in arranging the itinerary after check-in (in fact, it should be more reasonable to arrange before check-in, so that you can play more scientifically), and you can write it down when you arrange it, no one will remind you! Not a 1 to 1 butler service. Traveling to and from the scenic spots is by scenic bus. The ancient city pick-up is carpooling, Buick business. The driver is very nice. There are no supermarkets around the room. A little regretful, it is better to stay at another Snow Mountain Miracle Hotel. It is cheaper than this and there are milk tea shops nearby.

All the waiters serve with a smile, answer any questions, and the staff is well trained. The itinerary arranged by the housekeeper Ram is also very considerate. The price of the room is indeed quite expensive, but it includes transfers to and from the mountain road, sightseeing in the scenic spot, and seeing the road along the way. In fact, it is not bad. This season, any homestay in Dukezong will cost more than 1k. This 360 suite is actually for 4 people. On the third floor, there are two bedrooms, two study rooms, two bathrooms and a huge living room. The balcony has a good view and there are many stars at night, but the key to the balcony door cannot be opened. It's a little tricky to get in and out. I ate five meals in the restaurant without stepping on the thunder, and they were all delicious, especially the ******* pork ribs. There are healthy soup snacks and fruits every night. The breakfast is a little monotonous, Jiugonggejia rice noodle. It's a little high, and people who usually exercise a lot should pay attention, especially when they go to the pagoda. All in all, a hotel with great potential.

My wife and I are both members of Marriott. Whether it is going abroad before the epidemic or domestic travel after the epidemic, we choose Marriott's high-end brand hotels, which gives me the feeling that this place is not inferior at all. The room is spacious and comfortable, the scenery is unmatched by other places, especially the service, very thoughtful and considerate, take us to the scenic spots, give us sugar and oxygen to relieve high reaction, the food is delicious and affordable, chicken soup and milk will be delivered at night, butler service is available Calling on call... The service here is warmer than that of a five-star hotel. Really looking forward to staying again.

msg:In the hotel in the scenic spot, if you come to the scenic spot alone, it is probably not fun, but it is great to stay in the hotel for two days and play the scenic spot by the way!
In the peak season recently, the rooms are very tight. I only booked two days in advance, and there are only 360¬∞ rooms left. It is a little expensive, but it is worth it.
The room is too big to imagine, with 2 bedrooms, 1 living room, 1 bar room, 1 study room, 2 small halls, 2 bathrooms, and a terrace shared with the next house. I thought it was for 4 people at one time, but I went to see the order and found that it was 2 people The child lives, so I immediately turned the tea room into a bedroom üòÇ
The service is very good, there is a pick-up and drop-off, and the attitude of the master is very good. Along the way, the observation deck will ask if you want to stop and take a look. The hotel usually arranges buses for hotel guests to visit the scenic spots together. The room is given a zipline ticket or a rafting ticket. Because I booked 2 rooms for 2 nights, I experienced it all. I feel that rafting is just like boating. The zipline is good, very stable, and there is video playback.
The breakfast is ok, lunch and dinner can be eaten at the hotel, the price is not expensive, the taste is good, at least I especially like it! In the evening, the hotel will send fruit and snacks, which is also very good. I eat it every day.
In terms of attractions, I recommend the temple behind the hotel, which is very beautiful, especially when the weather is good. You can also learn about the story of Balagezong, which will be very interesting after understanding it.

When you arrive at the entrance of the scenic spot, you must first go to the ticket office to go through the ticket collection procedures. After entering the scenic spot, you have to drive 17 kilometers of Panshan Road to reach the hotel. The drop is more than 1,000 meters! The three contents of the scenic spot are very worth visiting. The Buddhist temple should be kept warm, and the altitude is about 4200 meters. The Whispering Wall personally thinks it is the most worthwhile place to go, with glass planks and thrilling ziplines! Canyoning is also great! The order of the tour I suggest to go to the Whispering Wall first and then the Big Buddha Temple, because everyone went to the Buddhist temple early in the morning. There are very few people in the Whispering Wall, but it is staggered from most people, but the hotel staff will recommend going to the Buddhist temple first.

Hotel, the staff are very friendly, the service attitude is particularly good, due to the geographical location, the food types are relatively monotonous. It is recommended to have breakfast early in the morning as there will be fewer people. It is worth mentioning that the water quality here is very good, and the water from the tap can be directly drunk. The room is relatively clean. The fatal flaw is that the wooden floor is seriously aged, and the abnormal noise is very loud when you step on it. There are also relatively hard mattresses, people who are used to sleeping on soft mattresses need to take it easy.

If you are a friend who only arranges to stay for one night, it is recommended that you go to the Grand Canyon to play rafting first. Go to the other two attractions the next day, and you will know the reason when you go!

Location:
Look at picture 1‚É£: It is really backed by a big mountain and it is a near-straight peak. Looking up to the opposite side is also the feeling of living in the mountains, especially the canyon here is as high as 4000 meters. Immerse yourself in the awe of nature

Room Facilities:
It can only be described as a surprise. In such a mountain canyon, there is a *******-style building rebuilt in the Tusi Mansion. There are only more than 20 rooms in total, and the interior decoration is indeed exquisite and wild. The whole house is heated, and there is no chill in the room in the canyon with huge temperature difference. The bedding and bathroom exceeded expectations, and the public spaces were dotted with small scenes like Figure 8‚É£, which made the whole hotel suddenly feel wild in the woods

Serve:
Picture 1‚É£0‚É£ is the welcome fruit plate; picture 1‚É£1‚É£'s good night snack is actually matsutake healthy chicken soup with egg tarts, I would have known that I would not have dinner [Facepalm], the taste of egg tarts is delicious, so touching [hands folded]; picture 1‚É£2‚É£ is One person serving for breakfast, served in a compact wooden food box, compact and delicious. Everything is perfect except for the amazing portion size

In addition to the food, the floor heating in the house was turned on before check-in, and good night snacks were delivered at night, and the night lights were turned on. The beautiful ******* lady who received the reception was also enthusiastically arranging the tour route for the next day when we checked in. When I missed the dinner time at the hotel, I even called to ask if I needed to stay in advance...
I really feel the super five-star service standard, I am really touched [GoForIt][GoForIt][GoForIt]

The zipline is very cool, there is no phobia at all, and it is an experience to go there.
The plank road of the Grand Canyon is very safe and extremely safe, and it is also worth hiking to enjoy the beautiful scenery.

Each room has an independent terrace, where you can sit in the sun and breathe fresh air. The most value-for-money is that the hotel will arrange separate guests to the Balagezong Scenic Area for free, accompanied by a private butler and driver. In addition to free play, it will also take you to a ******* home to drink butter tea, chat, and experience the local customs. The hotel has free tickets for the Grand Canyon glass path, zipline and rafting. Interested children's shoes can experience it.

You can't miss the Snow Mountain Ice Spring Manor when you arrive at Balagezong! !

I‚Äôm so lucky to go to Balagezong when I was in Shangri-La
It's so beautiful! ! Especially the pagoda on the top of the mountain!

Not many hotels in the park
I chose Bingquan, and the room rate already includes entrance fees and play items
It can only be said that it is very very cost-effective! And the butler Tashi is really dedicated! It was the evening when it arrived, so help us plan the next day's itinerary.

Helped us to upgrade the suite, the hotel room is very large and comfortable
Eat at the hotel in the evening, the portion is really big
A lot of breakfast! One serving is enough for two!
Both milk and butter tea are delicious!

All in all, hotels and scenic spots are highly recommended!
I hope that Balagezong will be known to more people
More tourists go to feel its beauty!

msg:The hotel rooms are spacious and clean, and the environmental facilities are good. The rooms are warmer and it is quite comfortable to live on the plateau in winter. Because the hotel is in the scenic area, there is no other catering in the scenic area, and three meals a day have to be settled in the hotel. The breakfast of the package tastes so-so, it is nine square grid, and then you can add rice noodles, ordering feels salty taste and heavy oil, there are not many types of dishes, people from the south may not be used to eating, it is recommended to bring some instant noodles. The dishes are probably 70-90 yuan for a portion of meat, although the portion is okay but the price is not high, I personally feel that it is not very tasty.
The hotel has a butler service, you can drive you to visit several attractions, but I feel that the butler does not like to speak actively, it is quieter, only sends guests to the attractions, and does not actively interact with the guests, you need to ask the guests themselves. Response. Personally I feel that the butler is not very professional, just a driver and a staff member to send you to play. By the way, when checking in, the staff didn't tell the guests in detail about this place and the schedule of activities around the hotel. I still asked when I would have breakfast at night, and I was told that I would gather to go to the pagoda at 9:30 the next morning. In fact, it was a bit strange. I was told to go to the canyon at 2:30 in the afternoon when I came back from the pagoda trip. , I was told whether it could be changed to 1:30, I felt very casual to play according to the hotel time, and did not communicate with the guests in advance. It may also be the off-season, and the quality of the hotel staff's service is uneven, but for this experience, the service here is really quite casual.
Ignoring the service, the scenic spots are really shocking, especially the Shambhala Stupa. You can overlook Balagezong from the top of the 4250-meter mountain, and strolling in the snow on the top of the mountain is still very moving. Then the next day, walking and rafting on the plank road in the Shangri-La Valley is another style. I personally think that the destination of Balagezong is worth coming here to relax and experience nature. Although there are not many entertainment projects, there is nothing to eat. In winter, it is mainly to look at the natural scenery and snow-capped mountains, which is also good. choose. By the way, the hotel staff said that it is good to go hiking here from May to July. Those who like to hike can come over and share it!

The scenery along the way from Shangri-La to Balagezong was very beautiful and the altitude was almost the same. It dropped more than 800 meters, reducing the discomfort caused by altitude sickness. The 18th bend of the mountain road really begins when you enter the scenic spot. The driving skills of the driver are tested by many issuing roads and sharp bends. The hotel is small and the appearance is very simple, but the interior of the room is still carefully arranged, spacious and comfortable. The overall atmosphere is also good. . The hotel has only one restaurant, so the basic 6 meals for two nights staying in the hotel like ours must be settled in the hotel. There are not many choices of dishes, but every dish is delicious. We have not been thundered for two days after our stay. The waiter said that the chef had been invited from Kunming. The waiters are all ******* brothers and sisters, very simple. The hotel will be equipped with a butler to take care of the two-day itinerary, all of which are accompanied by a car. Although this is very friendly to the elderly and children, it also limits the space for tourists to explore freely. The scenic area is currently actively developing walking routes. Hope for the future Give tourists more choices. Fortunately, I met Mr. Sina Dingzhu in the hotel and took a photo with him. The husband is very kind and thank the tourists for staying in. We sincerely thank him for his contribution to this land. It is very remarkable. The overall feeling is still very satisfactory. This is a good choice for tourists who like the original ecology.

msg:The environment is worth a four-hour drive back and forth. The driver who picked up was very nice and took us to the nucleic acid test. It was enthusiastic and interesting, but the car was about to fly, haha! The Grand Canyon is beautiful, and the rafting is really gentle. I don‚Äôt even bother to go back the same way. Drifting for 120 people. The ropeway was too scared to go up. The room is big, chicken soup and milk are delivered at night. Ignore the butler, there is no butler service, just arrange for you on the bus, the butler is Jiang Chu, and there is basically no communication. The place to see the Shambhala stupa is beautiful, and the yak Sahuan was photographed. Gesang, the housekeeper of the hotel next door, is nice, at least very responsible. The pork chops for dinner in the hotel were actually quite delicious, the others were just average, the chicken pot was average, and I didn't eat much. Breakfast is simple and neat.

All in-house guests can enjoy the hotel‚Äôs exclusive tour bus. The 1-day tour is divided into two attractions. After breakfast, go to the Shambhala Pagoda (4200 meters above sea level) and return to the hotel for lunch at noon. , Depart from Echo Wall, Canyon Glass Path and Bala Village at about 2 in the afternoon. The welcome fruit and Mei-Japanese health soup are delicious. Breakfast is the "Nine Palaces" set meal with rice noodles, porridge, milk, and butter tea. The whole is satisfied. .
üöó Transportation: For a self-driving tour, you need to drive from the canyon to the hotel by yourself. To enter the scenic spot, you need to sign a "safety agreement".
üßπSanitation: The room is tidy and clean, and the stay is very quiet
üçÉEnvironment: The hotel is located in the center of Shan'ao in the scenic area. Wild ******* macaques can be seen when dining in the restaurant in the morning. The ecology is very good without excessive commercial development.

msg:[Location] The hotel is in the scenic area, and there should be 2 or 3 hotels in total. In terms of convenience, the location is quite inconvenient. If you want to buy something, you can only drive from the hotel to Bala Village in the scenic area. There is only one small shop. There is no beer in the small shop, instant noodles and some other products that I personally think are the most basic. But in view of the fact that in the scenic spot, you can see the stars at night, that's all, not 1 star.
[Cleanliness] The cleanliness of the room is definitely not as good as that of a chain of five-star hotels. The cleanliness of the hotel lobby is the same, even if it is cleaned up, the table is dirty. The executive suite I stayed in, the main bathroom and bathroom floor leaked no water (as shown in the picture, because of the design), the shoes in the room were slippery even when walking on the floor without water, and it was even worse on the ground with water, very Fall easily.
[Services] Hada will be delivered to you when you get off the bus, and you can give a basic itinerary. Other than that there is really no service. At four o'clock in the morning on the day of check-in, because I lived on the top floor, the roof began to make dangdangdang noises. Because I stayed on the top floor (3rd floor), I went to the 4th floor (top floor) to check myself at 4:00 in the morning. I also contacted the housekeeper the next day, but there was no result in the end. I had made an appoin**ent for breakfast the next morning and went to the scenic spots with the hotel car at 9:30 in the morning. Well, then it's just after 9 o'clock? I went to have breakfast (fortunately, I ordered claypot chicken the day before and didn't eat it, but left it for the next day to cook rice noodles). Fortunately, I saved a little bit of rice noodles, or I really didn't eat it! A few waiters chatted casually in the restaurant, and put a small teapot and a few others. There was a little milk tea in the teapot (still cold), and there was nothing else to eat except our rice noodles. Rice noodles, I don't know if this is the case (I didn't eat them in Lijiang and Dali anyway), all the rice noodles were broken into small pieces. We were not allowed to sit in the restaurant, but were only allowed to eat in the lobby. The lobby table is very dirty too

The price/performance ratio is too high, and the Balagezong is also very beautiful. I recommend you to come once.

The hygienic standards of the service can‚Äôt keep up, the sheets smell of disinfectant, and the snacks and syrup were delivered the night before to clean up the next night... You can choose to spend the night in the scenic spot. For dining, the special restaurant in Bala Village is the first choice, which is good. The food and cooking at the Bingquan Hotel is fine, but don't order rice noodles or the like. The meat is so pitiful that it feels like being slaughtered. There is also a canteen that can go to Bala Village. The hotel is also surprisingly expensive. I wonder if it should be a unified price. How can it be so much more expensive than the scenic spots.

The hotel is full of butler-style services. The butler‚Äôs little baby is very warm and lovely, and the itinerary arranged for us is very reasonable. Regarding Balagezong, it is really a beautiful pure land. Every waiter here is very kind and honest, without any commercial feeling.

While continuing to develop, we can retain this simplicity. See you if you have a chance!

You can understand the story of Mr. Sina Dingzhu's road construction. It is not easy to build roads, and it is even more difficult to change people's consciousness! I think they are doing very well! The scenery is beautiful, and there is no need to spend money to go to Switzerland. It is possible to stay for two or three days, and one day is a little rushed. Don't worry about the small things you usually book a hotel. The landscape, scenery, people, and the hotel will not let down the time and money you spend.

msg:Balagezong Scenic Spot and hotels in the scenic spot are managed by the same group. Check-in includes scenic spot tickets and one-person experience coupons for rafting or ziplining. The hotel is more flexible in terms of pick-up and drop-off, that is, it can mobilize the scenic spot cart. There are also CMB or SUV cars that can serve the itinerary inside and outside the scenic spot. These are the more convenient points of the hotel.

But the hotel is completely different from the normal five-star hotel. I don't know who scored 4.9 in the evaluation. But it is definitely not for travelers who often stay in five-star hotels. The facilities of rooms and restaurants basically belong to the visual sense of guest houses. We came from Songtsam and felt that the gap was very big, and it was completely different from the expected hotel. To give three examples:

1. The phone number in the hotel room is empty when calling the front desk. When we asked for slippers and pillows, we always opened the door and shouted to the waiter. The pillows sent smelled like 84 disinfectant. He and daughter joked that this is a unique experience of 0-distance contact with hotel services;
2. There were three inexplicable power outages in the afternoon. The condoms in the room were placed directly on the table. I searched for them, but I couldn't find a drawer on the bedside table to put them in. I feel that I am not very professional in hotel operation and management;
3. When eating in the restaurant, I used a handwritten paper to settle the bill. I reported an extra 50 yuan. Later, it was said that a dish of 38 yuan was regarded as 88 yuan. Whether intentionally or unintentionally, we instantly don't want to eat in this hotel restaurant again. For breakfast, my wife said that she ate a broken egg shell that was not clean when she ate the cake, and she laughed.

Overall, the attitude of the hotel's service staff is good, and the overall health is also considered. The location is also very convenient for several recreational projects in the scenic spot. However, the facilities and management level of the hotel are completely incomparable with the five-star hotel, and the price/performance ratio is not so high. Our group stayed at Gaoshan Villa for two nights, Songtsam Meri for two nights, and Balagezong Ice Spring for one night. We all felt that the last night was a very average experience. For reference.

msg:The luxury hotel in Balagezong 4A scenic spot is said to be the residence of the ancestor Snadoji of Bala Village, so it is also called the Tusi Manor.

Self-driving cars pick up tickets at the entrance of the scenic spot, and are allowed to enter the scenic spot after completing the epidemic detection and signing the safety contract. After more than 30 minutes by car, climbing along the winding road, passing through many bends and hairpin bends, all the way to the manor is quite thrilling.

Our housekeeper Xiaosha and his two colleagues, brothers and sisters, are already waiting for us, offering Hada, the courtesy of a distinguished guest.

Activities: Xiao Sha arranges our activities for the next two days. Two residents can enjoy free canyon rafting or zipline, and there is a big bus that will take the manor guests to the pagoda, Guanyin wall, the Grand Canyon, etc. The morning and afternoon activities are separated, and the manor will return to the manor for dinner and rest at noon. (Reminder: The pink receipt was taken to change the ticket when I went to the attraction. I was left in the room, so I had to make up the ticket and drifted 120/person. Although the two butlers tried hard to fight, the financial of the attraction was not discussed.)

Room: A family of three adults stays in the super-large business room on the 2nd floor of Building 2, Tusi Manor, 115 square meters, opening the curtains, is a spectacular view.
One hall, two bedrooms, two bathrooms (separation of dry and wet), it is perfectly possible for two couples to live together. Stay comfortable and convenient. It would be better if a clothes rack can be placed at the entrance of the living room.

Service: Welcome fruits and midnight snacks. The midnight snacks are different on the two days, including chicken soup and egg tarts, hot milk and snacks. The room service aunt has a good attitude, and every little brother and sister she meets will greet with a smile.

Food: A restaurant arranges three meals, Chinese food, breakfast Jiugongge and rice noodles, as well as porridge, butter tea, and hot milk; the other two meals are ordered. The chef‚Äôs craftsmanship is good, especially the soups are delicious. We ate three dinners, except for two meals with a large pot of chicken soup, no other dishes crashed.

If you want to explore Balagezong in depth, Snow Mountain Ice Spring Health Manor is a good choice. It has a large living space and is very close to important scenic spots.

It is a miracle to build sky roads and luxury hotels in such a primitive village. Hope the manor will get better and better.

msg:This hotel is so pleasantly surprised. It‚Äôs suitable for players who don‚Äôt make a strategy and kill them with a black eye. First of all, it‚Äôs very helpful to pick up and drop off the Shangri-La county town. When they arrived at the hotel, the cute little girl added WeChat and was responsible for the whole process.

msg:The first time I came to Balagezong, I also saw the high scores on Ctrip. I chose this hotel before.

msg:The villa in the scenic spot is great. You can get the ticket after showing the order at the entrance of the scenic spot. You can drive directly into the scenic spot. Just after getting off the car, the staff will come to offer Hada. This is really the first time. We will assign a housekeeper, Xiao Jiang, our housekeeper, a great ******* brother, who will check in at 3 in the afternoon, and then accompany us to Echo Wall at 4 o‚Äôclock, and then go to Bara Village and have free butter tea to drink, introduce us All kinds of related things, the cost of going to Shambhala Stupa the next morning is also included. Although it seems that the price is very expensive, the various included scenic spots are actually several hundred yuan a night. The service is good, the room is It's so good, it's not a bargain

msg:Stayed for two nights with pick-up service. In the past 2 hours from Shangri-La, the entire Balagezong is a big oxygen bar. The hotel poster 2900-3000 will pass through the valley of the lowest 2100; therefore, it will be very comfortable and not easy to overturn; butler service Very good, to help plan the two-day itinerary. If we want to go hiking, we introduced us to the hiking route from the hotel to Naidang Ranch. For other trips, we followed the arrangements to go to various scenic spots; I fully experienced the Balagezong in the two days. The charm of this place; there are really few people here, so it should be hot; finally behind the hotel is the sutra hall dedicated to Twenty-one Tara, which is worth visiting.

msg:Located in the depths of the secret of Baragzong, the five-star is not only the hardware configuration of ******* characteristics, but also the trained and warm and thoughtful service of all the service personnel, especially our housekeeper Laosha, helped us arrange the whole trip from the beginning. Responding to our requests, we also took us to experience a "horse road" hike. Also on the way to give us Bodhi Handstring and Blagzong discs.
Very perfect stay, tour experience.

Find the housekeeper and the waiter to solve the problem, and ignore it for a long time! The service level is very worrying üò£ The breakfast is very average, but ordering food at the restaurant during dinner time, some dishes are very good! Especially recommended ******* pig
