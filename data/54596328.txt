msg:The Habsburg hotel in Harbin was an amazing experience from the time you arrive till the time you leave. The hotel has a European theme to it as soon as you walk in. The staff at the front desk are friendly always greeting you as you walk in and out. Most of the staff speak English and are accommodating to locals as well as foreigners. The room was immaculate and spacious, the beds were comfortable. The only issue we had was that the room was too hot and trying to adjust the temperature on the AC wasn‚Äôt working so we had to sleep with the windows opened the entire night. Other than that, on the first day of arrival they had complimentary snacks as well as vouchers to enjoy the full experience of a Russian high tea as well as a cocktail in the evening at the bar. This hotel met all the expectations and is an affordable hotel to stay at in Harbin. The location was perfect it was situated near the Songhua river cable car, Zhongyang street where you can enjoy local street food and near St Sophia cathedral. We also enjoyed lunch and breakfast at the hotel and the service was amazing the manager Jenny was welcoming, friendly and accommodating and made sure we were comfortable and served us well. Habsburg hotel is definitely a hotel I would recommend staying at when visiting Harbin.

Also breakfast at this hotel is superb! It‚Äôs full of varieties of food but mostly Chinese food, not Western food. It‚Äôs really impressive for me to have breakfast here. There‚Äôs also big shrimps in the buffet line. I have never seen this option from other hotels. The room itself is also spacious. Location of this hotel is perfect, quite close to all main tourist attractions.

msg:Think this is a 4-5 stars hotel locally. The lobby is decent, not posh type. The rooms are cosy and beautiful. Kids like the kids room, toys and the sport car bed. All toiletries are provided and have kids version. Very thoughtful. Have a welcome fruits n snacks platters with high class mineral water. One thing we didn‚Äôt like about the hotel is it has a weird smell when we stepped out of the lift and walked towards our room. Like ‚Äòsalted fish‚Äô smell. Not sure if it is from carpet or some food brought in by others. The smell was also in our room. The hotel is at a busy road junction facing Songhua River. Around there are many local eateries. We had a hard time finding suitable food for us and kids as their local food are mostly beef, lamb and duck innards and spicy. End up we took a taxi and went to a restaurant called Sheng Tian Fu, recommended by the driver. Taxi drivers not many are familiar with this hotel, and have to show them namecard. Not too difficult to get to attractions such as Harbin Polarpark, Sofia church and Zhongyang Street. More convenient to travel by taxi as these places are not exactly very near hotel and it can be cold walking a distance of 1-2km.
Hotel provides decent breakfast with reasonable variety. Waitresses are friendly and proactive to chat with you and recommend you what to eat. One of them is called Xiao Liu, nice middle-age lady.
Overall, we had a pleasant stay at this hotel and may go back if we go to Harbin again and if the pricing of hotel is cheaper.

Breakfast is not great with choice or qualityü•πÔøºI knew there is  a construction going on opposite our hotel but my agent was told by hotel staff the noise only starts from 8am but in-fact they‚Äôre working around the clock so if you‚Äôre a light sleeper don‚Äôt stay there.

Breakfast was good, has a wide selection of food, including some local dishes. 

Service is kind of interesting - they left us some notes and gave us a warm broth/dessert of some kind as a room warming gift. They also gave us a little dessert platter every day. They gave us coupons for 2 free drinks at the bar, afternoon tea (none of which we use, since we're on a tight schedule), and some lottery tickets since it was 25/12. They actually organized a little Christmas party and there were some prizes to be won, it was nice.

On the other hand, the people seem a bit.. worn out and tired. They weren't as helpful and friendly as one may expect, but it's nothing major. Overall, we enjoyed our stay there and the room was quite comfortable.

There are two rooms, which are comfortable to live in. The hotel service staff are very considerate. The security guard saw the car entering the parking lot and directed the parking and helped with the luggage. The front desk staff also poured warm water for us during the check-in. The room is very comfortable, large and spacious, and there are free water and snacks. The hotel's buffet breakfast is especially praised. It has a rich variety and great taste. The fruits and pastries are fresh. The breakfast staff is also very considerate to prepare children's dining chairs and tableware.

msg:As soon as I stepped into this hotel, I felt the warmth. The security guard was very enthusiastic and wanted to take my suitcase. I didn't have much hope when I asked to change rooms, but the little sister at the front desk checked if there were any available rooms without saying a word. Unexpectedly, I was changed to a more preferred room. I actually saw mouthwash in the hotel room. I have stayed in so many five-star hotels, but I have never seen it before. There are also snacks and love soup in the evening, and afternoon tea is also provided. To be honest, so many extra benefits are not fooling people at all, and the quality is good. In addition, I have to emphasize the hotel breakfast. There are many varieties, and the most important thing is that the taste is good. I stayed for 3 nights, and the breakfast content will change every day. This breakfast is worth it, and you can eat from 7 o'clock to 12 o'clock. The supervisor of the restaurant, "Great Breakfast", is even more enthusiastic. He took the initiative to recommend the hotel's homemade yogurt to us. I didn't expect it to be so delicious. He also took the initiative to help deliver the fruit to the table. The cleaning aunt on the 16th floor is also very enthusiastic and can help in time if there is any need. When checking out, I actually gave such a delicate and pocket-sized souvenir, which is great! In short, this is a treasure hotel. I will come again! I will also strongly recommend it to my relatives and friends! Harbin people are so warm and welcoming, love you!

The service is also good, but I read the reviews, the peak season price is more than 2000, forget it...off-season is still the best value for money.
There is only one shortcoming in the service, we didn't eat the cookie chocolate plate sent on the first day, we were going to eat it the next day, but found it was taken away the next day! ? ? It's confusing...I called the front desk and another one was sent, but there was no explanation.

msg:Habsburg is the best hotel I have stayed in in recent years. The breakfast is good and the restaurant is great. First of all, the hotel is in an excellent location. It is very close to the People's Square subway station. Opposite is the Songhua River Cableway, which can go to the Sun Island Scenic Area. It takes a few minutes to walk to Central Street. If you are interested, you can get up early to visit the Red Street Morning Market. There is also a iron pot stew called the stove pot pancake next to the hotel, which is very delicious. Secondly, the hotel staff has a strong sense of service. Snacks are prepared every day. On the first day of the hotel, the oil tea noodles were delivered to the room for us to taste. The hotel breakfast is rich in variety and tastes very good. The sisters in the restaurant feed all kinds of food and take the initiative to help guests pick up fruits and yogurt. I look forward to having breakfast every day during my stay. Recommended by the staff, we went to Lilac Park, which is a very niche place. It takes only more than 10 minutes to take a taxi from the hotel. There are thousands of lilacs in the park. If you come to Harbin in May, you might as well go and have a look. Although I only stayed for three days, Habsburg made me feel what it means to be at home.

From the security reception at the entrance to the guest room restaurant, the greetings were warm and thoughtful, and the attention to detail was paid attention to. In the evening, steaming and fragrant fried wheat noodles were delivered in a thermos cup (Shanghai dialect) ) and snacks and chocolates. It was very considerate to provide a foot bath because I knew I wasn‚Äôt sleeping well. The breakfast variety is rich to meet the needs of different tastes. Especially when Sister Liu Jinling saw that we were elderly and it was inconvenient to pick up meals, she took the initiative to warmly and thoughtfully give us this and that. She recommended the restaurant‚Äôs homemade yogurt without additives. It tasted really good. The meal time was extended to noon. At 2 o'clock, I was very considerate of the guests and praised their breakfast üëç. Sister Liu also sent us to the elevator of the restaurant to bow and say goodbye, which was very friendly. The hotel's location faces the Songhua River, and is surrounded by the cross-river cable car, Stalin Park, the Middle East Railway Bridge, the Flood Fighting Memorial Tower, Central Street, and the Hongzhuan Street morning market. You can feel the fireworks of Harbin people. It is about a 15-minute walk from the hotel to the People's Square Station of Metro Line 2. Exit 3 is the main entrance of Sun Island. It is very convenient for traveling, shopping, eating and shopping. There are not many hotels that I would like to stay in again.

Although the road is under construction for the subway, you can hardly hear it with the windows closed, which does not affect your rest. The breakfast is rich in variety and tastes good, with some local specialties, such as pot-baked pork. The breakfast service auntie is very enthusiastic, "Hello breakfast". The hotel is only a 1-minute walk from the local famous online celebrity store Shanhetun Iron Pot Stew.

The hygiene is good, with two bedrooms and two bathrooms, and fresh fruits and coffee and snacks every day.
In addition, the location of the hotel is also very good. It is next to Central Street, and the cable car station is a few dozen meters across the road. The surrounding area is very prosperous and convenient to go anywhere.
Except for the price being a bit expensive during the May Day holiday, everything else is greatüëçüèª

msg:The location is excellent. It's a short walk to the Songhua River. It's nice to go to Stalin Park at night. It's very close to Central Avenue and Shanhetun Iron Pot Stew, a restaurant with a long queue. It's about a two-minute walk. We called our number and went back to the hotel to rest, and then went to eat when our number came. The hotel service is very good and polite. We went out for a walk and afternoon tea was delivered to our room. The afternoon tea tasted good. The hotel's breakfast tasted very good. There are many varieties, such as sweet and sour pork, so you don't have to order it outside. The hotel's taste is better than outside. Dried blueberries were also given when checking out, and they tasted pretty good. The only problem is that the subway is being repaired at the door, which is a bit noisy. But because of the Asian Winter Games, the subway must be repaired more, and there is nothing we can do.

As soon as I arrived at the parking lot, the security guard directed me to park the car. After parking, he helped me with my luggage and washed my car. The receptionist at the hotel was very enthusiastic. There were various small gifts, afternoon tea and souvenirs, which made us feel the hospitality of Harbin. The breakfast was also very rich. The room facilities were also very good. It was enough for 4 adults and 2 children. There was a door between the two rooms, which was very convenient.

Opposite the hotel is the Songhua River, with a panoramic view of the river. Cross the road and you can take a cable car to Sun Island.
Most importantly, the hotel's service is super good, and the staff in all positions are very comprehensive, meticulous, thoughtful and warm. I stayed for three days, and there were surprises for breakfast every day. The restaurant is great! Highly recommended! Worth coming again!

As soon as you sit down in the restaurant, someone will come to help you get a baby chair and give you fruit yogurt and steamed eggs that your baby can eat. The breakfast is from 7 to 12 o'clock, which is very friendly to young babies. There should be no other hotel with this time. The most difficult thing for young babies to travel is eating. They also brought a lunch box to pack some porridge for the baby at noon. When I left the next day, I found that the car parked in the parking lot had been simply washed. There were constant surprises. The security guards also deserve praise. I will stay in this hotel next time I come to Harbin

Location: The hotel is in a very good location, very close to the Songhua River sightseeing cableway, less than 5 minutes walk away. It is not far from Central Avenue, less than 10 minutes away. Behind the hotel is Shanhetun Restaurant, where you can eat iron pot stewed goose, and nearby is the Red and Special Hui Minguan that Sun Honglei loves to eat.
Service: The hotel service is very good. When you are about to reach the door of the hotel, a waiter asked to help with the suitcase. The front desk always serves with a smile. All the service staff in the hotel are very warm and friendly. Good night hot milk will also be delivered in the evening.
Project: The package I bought includes a queen suit. There can only be one set of clothes in a room, and the clothes are all one size. You can choose and match clothes and jewelry. You can wear them outside the hotel and take pictures at will after paying a deposit.

First of all, when checking in, I said I was looking forward to a better view room with a view of the Swan Castle. The front desk gave me a room on the 16th floor with an unbeatable view. When the sun sets, you can see the sun shining on the river.
Secondly, the hotel's breakfast is really super good, and the restaurant is great.
The breakfast category is very strange, with Chinese steamed noodles, Western sandwiches, egg tarts, salads, and Harbin's specialties, pot-baked meat, pig-killing dishes, chicken stewed with mushrooms, very, very complete.
The service is also more than expected, and the guests feel at home.
In addition, breakfast can be served until 12 o'clock, which is very suitable for sleeping until you wake up naturally and have brunch.
Finally, I sincerely hope that Harbin can get better and better, and I hope that the good of Northeast China can be seen by more people!
I will stay in this hotel next time I come, love it!

I am a family with two children and booked a two-bedroom room. Although there is construction opposite the hotel, the hotel's sound insulation is really good, and sleep is not disturbed at all. There is no bathtub in the room, and the two bedrooms have their own separate bathrooms, and the rooms are relatively large. The downside is that the shower room has a sewer smell, but it is negligible compared to the advantages.

Afternoon tea and a small towel were also given when we checked in. There was a snack every day, and a small gift was given when we checked out. It was so thoughtful!
The room was big and beautiful, with complete facilities, and it was very comfortable to live in.
The location is also very good, and it only takes a few minutes to walk to Central Street.

msg:This is my second time in Harbin and my second time staying at the Habsburg Hotel. This is a hotel I like very much. The room is comfortable. I need to read materials. The desk is brightly lit and the scenery outside the window is good. You can see the Songhua River and the Neuschwanstein Castle cableway across the river. It is not far from Central Street and is also close to the riverside for a walk. The bathroom has a large flow of water for bathing, the water temperature is very good, the faucet is sensitive, and it is very convenient to adjust the water temperature and water volume. Shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, and moisturizer are all in small bottles, and the fragrance is relatively neutral and pleasant. The bathroom is spacious, and there are two large bottles of hand soap and laundry detergent by the sink, so you can wash some small things at hand. The hotel also has laundry and a gym, but I didn't use it because my schedule was tight this time. I ordered takeout for dinner alone, and it was delivered by a robot, so cute. The bedside table is considerately prepared with a mobile phone charging cable. I didn't use the one I brought, and I threw it in the box and never took it out. The hotel also gave steam eye patches, and small bags of tea and snacks for afternoon tea every afternoon. The hotel's breakfast is rich, with freshly ground coffee beans, Chinese and Western breakfasts, wontons, noodle soup, dumplings, tofu brain, boiled shrimp, pot-wrapped pork, chicken stewed with mushrooms, various cold dishes and hot dishes; bread, cake, yogurt, jam, vegetable and fruit salad, as well as watermelon, honeydew melon and other fruits. It is my favorite buffet, and the time is even more considerate from 7 am to 12 pm. The hotel front desk is also very good. My cousin came to see me and accidentally left the car keys on the sofa in the lobby. The front desk helped us keep them. When we checked out, we heard us talking about the car keys at the front desk and immediately gave them to us. I would like to thank the beautiful girl at the front desk. In short, I stayed very comfortably for three days and felt well taken care of. Thank you Habsburg Hotel for leaving me with a good impression.

Three or four-star standard, the lobby is a little small, and the executive lounge is a bit simple, but the location is really nice. It's a 2-minute walk to the riverside. It's very convenient to take a taxi. However, it's 5 minutes away from the core of Central Street. It's highly recommended for travel.

üè†Facilities
The hardware in the room is okay. There is no special reminder that the suite has no window. It is a bit depressing and dark. The jack on the side of the bed is badly connected. The gallium nitride charger is a bit heavy. If it is not stuck, there will be a current sound, which is a bit scary. Others Quite satisfactory, after all, the price/performance ratio is good.

üíÅService
The service is definitely Northeast hot and very enthusiastic. From the doorman to the front desk to the guest rooms, everyone is great. They will take the initiative to show their kindness and actively help. The customer service depar**ent can also handle urgent problems in the middle of the night. The service is definitely five-star.

Overall, it's worth coming back. It would be better if the parking could be improved. I look forward to a better victory next time I visit. I will definitely come back to review.

There are some disadvantages: the subway is being built opposite, and the long-term construction will affect the riverside. Earplugs are provided in the room, which is acceptable.

From the moment I entered the gate, the bellman took the initiative to carry my luggage, poured a cup of fruit tea while waiting for check-in, and brought the children to the front desk for free snacks and a car. The hotel room is very spacious. When they saw me taking care of my children at breakfast, they took the initiative to help. Before leaving, they even prepared snacks and fruits for us to eat on the road. After staying for three days, I was satisfied with every detail. I recommend staying there.

There are many internet celebrity check-in restaurants along the way, as well as the Hongzhuan Street morning market, which is extremely convenient. The bathroom uses Kohler sanitary ware, a famous brand toiletry set, toothbrushes and wooden combs are made of environmentally friendly materials, and mouthwash and real steam eye masks are thoughtfully prepared. The room is clean and there is a late-night snack menu. The Northeastern barbecue is so unique, delicious and not expensive. The view from the river view room is great, you can see the Songhua River and the Internet Celebrity Theater. I will choose Habsburg next time.

It should be similar to the positioning of a fast Vienna hotel. In addition, the hotel service is not professional enough. After staying for two days, the room card could not be used to open the door three times. I had no choice but to go downstairs to the front desk to get the card again. Two receptionists were checking in for another family at the same time, so they asked me to Wait, there were actually a few waiters idle nearby who could have helped, but they didn't do it. Finally, after my reminder, I asked a male waiter to do the card processing, and the problem was solved in thirty seconds. , I would have to wait for more than ten minutes if I didn't push, which is still not professional enough. I made an on-the-spot comparison and found that the Puyan Hotel next door is better. It is at least the level of a four-star hotel. The hardware and services are still at the level of a fast hotel.

msg:Why can Harbin get out of the circle?
As a Changchun native, I have always liked the city of Harbin and have been going here since 20 years ago. But when I came here for the first time after three years of epidemic, I was really shocked!
üïåüçÅI have stayed in many hotels in Harbin, and their hotel really makes people feel the power of the service industryüëçWe originally booked a 33-square-meter family room, but maybe it was the off-season, so we upgraded it to a car-themed suite for free. It has two double beds. The room is connected, and the two bathrooms üëçüëçüëç include a child's piano, ukulele, and storybooks. The welcome fruits and pastries are also very good, and 4 bottles of Perrier water are given as a gift. Although I don't like to drink it, it does reflect the a**osphere of the hotel. While we went downstairs to have breakfast for an hour and a half, the room was already cleaned!
üçîBreakfast is what surprised me. Although it is not as diverse as the five-star hotels in Hangzhou, it is! but! but! The service and taste are definitely better! Manager Jiangjing‚Äôs Jiangjing Restaurant specializes in enjoying delicious food with a view of the river. As a Northeasterner, I am very pleased to be able to eat fish-flavored shredded pork and pot-wrapped pork for breakfast. This is the first time I encountered a hotel breakfast with hot dogs, sandwiches, homemade yogurt, homemade yogurt and homemade cakes. It is definitely much better than the bought ones! When I was worried about what to do with the cakes and egg tarts that my children took but didn‚Äôt eat, the manager of Jiangjing actually provided me with packaged services üòÉ It was the first time in my life that I had packaged food at a buffet üëç
üêãü¶àPoseidon is also quite shocking. The interactive experience is very good. However, due to winter, the catering is basically closed. The experience should be better when it is open in summer.
üå∑Now here‚Äôs the highlight, friends, I highly recommend the Red Gate Banquet. At Deyun Society, you can experience a feast of traveling back to the ancient Tang Dynasty, enjoying dancing and drinking.

msg:Our trip to Harbin in just four days and three nights allowed us to fully experience the enthusiasm and vitality of this city. The Habsburg Hotel is great. We stayed in a parent-child room. Many of the furnishings and facilities were well thought out and truly met the various needs of adults and children. I have to mention the buffet breakfast provided by the hotel. I have never seen it in China. The hotel's breakfast is open until 12 o'clock üòä It provides great convenience for people like us who like to sleep in during leisure travel! The hotel's river view restaurant has a beautiful environment and rich dishes. Thank you Sister Hua for your warm hospitality and providing a lot of useful information for our trip! Next time you come to Erbin, you must choose Habsburg Hotel again!
Moreover, the hotel is very close to the Songhua River Cableway and Central Street! !

He very considerately packed some special snacks for us. We forgot to bring them on the first day, and prepared fruits and snacks for us on the second day. You can meet her by chance next time you go there - Liu Jinling. The overall service of the hotel is very good. The room includes afternoon tea, Perrier water, and a variety of fruits.

msg:Twelve days' trip to the Northeast. The first hotel I stayed at was the most expensive hotel besides Yabuli CLUBMED, and also the worst. Known as a five-star hotel, the price is far higher than that of the Shangri-La, Marriott, and Wanda Vista in the same period. However, in terms of front desk, elevators, rooms, services, etc., they are only worthy of three-star standards. I was shocked as soon as I walked in. Such a small front desk, such inferior furniture, narrow elevator, and damp carpet! What's even worse is that the hotel is facing the subway construction site, and the excavators are making noise day and night. I didn't sleep well every night for three nights. People who are not strong enough to sleep should be careful! Be careful! People who are accustomed to the quality of branded five-star hotels should also be careful! Be careful!

msg:A hotel with great service! The room is large and quite hot. It is recommended to open the window when sleeping at night. There is a humidifier in the room, which must be turned on at night. It is very close to the Songhua River, just across the road. It is about 800 meters away from the People's Square subway station and Central Street. , it is also very close to the Hongzhuan Street morning market. It is relatively convenient to travel. There are many places to eat around. Special thanks to the security guard Jiao Ming, who is very thoughtful and enthusiastic! I stayed for three nights and received fruit snacks every day. It was very considerate and a very satisfying stay.

msg:The young ladies and uncles at the front desk of the hotel were very warm and polite. They also helped me find express delivery several times. Every time I came back from outside, the staff would give hot coffee and drinks to my family, which was very considerate. There are also Madier popsicles and Maotai ice cream for sale at the front desk. Before checking out, the lady at the front desk changed my plastic bag into a cloth bag because plastic bags will break in cold weather. She was very careful.

The entertainment, fitness and laundry room on the third floor is fully equipped, and there are mineral water and charging ports in every corner, which is very considerate.

After staying in a car family room for two nights, on the way back from Xuexiang, a staff member called us to ask if there were any elderly or children with us and if there were any special requirements. The room is very clean, the carpet is also very clean, and it does not look old. It is not close to the construction side, so you can hardly hear the sound of construction outside. The cleaning lady on the 16th floor is also very nice! The bedding and towels are also very clean, I brought them once. Isolation sleeping bags are useless.

The service at Jiangjing Restaurant is really good. Breakfast is available until 12 o'clock, which is very convenient for families with children. They don't have to wake up their children early. The environment of the Jiangjing restaurant is also great. Breakfast actually includes salted shrimps, pot-roasted pork, Northeastern pork dishes, etc. (I was shocked), both Chinese and Western styles, as well as freshly made noodles by the chef. The staff are very warm and polite. . Sister Huang is really considerate. She helped the children get yogurt and fruits. We met after check-out and also packed snacks for the children to take to the airport. My daughter said that Sister Huang is the nicest person she has ever metüò¨.
We didn't go for afternoon tea, but it was delivered to the room, which was very thoughtful.

I looked at this hotel for a long time before booking it. I canceled it after reading a lot of bad reviews. Later I found that the other hotels were not to my liking, so I made a new reservation. I highly recommend it to families with children. Children are very picky about hotels, but they like Habsburg very much.

Facilities: very good
Hygiene: Very good. I'm quite picky, but I can't fault it.
Environment: Very good, comfortable and convenient
Service: Really enthusiastic
Breakfast: River View Restaurant is really great
Exclusive refreshments: great portions
Russian leisure afternoon tea: very good, look at the pictures

msg:The hotel is very close to the Songhua River. It takes a total of five minutes to walk across the road to the riverside. If you want to take the ropeway to Sun Island, the ticket office and boarding point are also here, which is very convenient. There is subway construction in front of the hotel. The front desk said that the construction will be completed by the end of the year. It will be more convenient to travel in the future. There is almost no noise. You can avoid the noise by booking a room not facing the river with the hotel in advance. The hotel has afternoon tea every day. Although it is relatively simple, the food has local characteristics. It focuses on an experience. In the evening, a small snack will be prepared for you in the room, which is considerate. Although the hotel room facilities are not new, they are clean, the heating is sufficient and comfortable. The Northeast is a bit dry, so you need to apply more moisturizer and drink more water. The hotel is a five-minute walk from the Red Brick Street morning market. It was still very lively when I passed by at 8:30 in the morning. Fatty Yin's fried cake stall was still there after nine o'clock. I stopped by on the last day and bought two bean paste and rose ones. They were quite delicious. Central Street is also next to the hotel. It is convenient for shopping, eating, traveling and taking the subway. I will stay here again next time. It is safe, convenient and not expensive. It is very cost-effective. The hotel waiters are warm and friendly, a big thumbs up. The first photo is of the huge snowman in front of the hotel. Everyone passing by has to take photos with it. It‚Äôs so big and cute. The first eight photos are all photos of the hotel. Behind is the Songhua River, the cableway, the Flood Control Memorial Tower, the Central Bookstore on Central Street, Daoli Food Market, the Red Brick Street Morning Market, the subway, Sophia Church, the Songhua River towards the Music Square, and the Ritz Carle. pause.

As soon as we entered the door to check in, there was a front desk employee named Xiao Zhang who served as a housekeeper. After checking in, he enthusiastically sent luggage to the room! We are a family of three travelers with two 70-year-old grandparents (grandpa and grandma) and a 9-year-old grandson. We are very satisfied with the warm service! Also, the restaurant manager Huang takes great care of her, caters to the tastes of the elderly and children, and takes the initiative to deliver the buffet food to the table. Thank you so much to her! There was also the security guard at the door, Mr. Jiao, who stood in the biting cold wind and took a taxi for us to travel in the weather of more than 20 degrees below zero, and only after arranging for us to get on the bus did we feel at ease. We said thank you, and he replied that this is what we should do! This hotel has such a well-trained staff and the service is warm, thoughtful and attentive. How can we not praise them! There are also fruit snacks delivered to the room, and Russian-style leisurely afternoon tea~ In short, we will definitely spread the word to recommend this hotel, not for anything else, but for the recognition and recognition they have received.

Afternoon tea was given to two people while staying at the hotel. The afternoon tea service guy, Shi Liang, was super nice. His service was enthusiastic and serious. He recommended things to do in the surrounding area and answered all questions.
I got two cups of fruit tea when I came back in the evening. It was said that there was a performance, but I was too tired so I didn‚Äôt watch it.
There are also thoughtful snacks when you return to the room.
The room has a very good view, with an unobstructed view of the castle and Songhua River opposite, like a fairy tale world.
The check-out service was still very good, patient and attitude was good, and dried blueberries were given as a gift.
Finally, I would like to praise the security guy for proactively asking if he wanted to pick up his luggage. His service was excellent and he helped put the suitcase in the trunk of the car.
The location of the hotel is very good, it is easy to walk to Central Street and the riverside.

The Habsburg Hotel faces the Songhua River and has an excellent location. However, from the lobby layout to the guest room layout, it is still some distance from the brand's 5-star hotel. However, the service in the hotel is warm, showing the warm-heartedness of Northeastern people. The hot porridge after returning from the snow is particularly heart-warming. I would also like to thank the waiters on the 6th floor for their care and help.

Although I just made a note about the anniversary when booking
They thoughtfully upgraded the room type when we checked in. Judging from the passenger flow, this hotel was definitely full that day. Thank you very much.
Then I encountered some force majeure external factors during my stay, which made me wonder if I had chosen the wrong hotel. Fortunately, I met a front office manager named Alina, who took the lead in helping us solve a series of problems, which proved my choice. correct. During many journeys, Harbin Habsburg made us feel what service is. It gave us warmth to the greatest extent, and every detail was everywhere, making people feel heart-warming.

After my careful selection, this is a hotel with affordable price, good environment and excellent location near Central Street.
üë©The hotel service is meticulous and considerate, from the small gesture of the concierge who quickly took the luggage when entering the door, to the refreshing smile of the front desk staff, the considerate visit of the restaurant manager to understand the service quality, the considerate greetings of the brothers and sisters of the restaurant waiters, and the front office manager Zhou The lady's very "one step ahead" service awareness and decision-making, as well as her meticulous and silent attentive service, made our ice and snow trip feel the warmth of winter.
The hotel facilities are very well maintained, with no obvious signs of age or wear, and regular maintenance is done well.
The category and quality of the hotel's breakfast are also in line with the hotel's positioning and style. There is no superficiality, rich categories, and diverse tastes.
All the front office staff were very positive and genuinely dedicated to serving us.
The selection of guest room amenities from the sandalwood series is also in line with the overall fragrance design style of the hotel. The bedding is also very clean and comfortable, and the towels are of a high level of hygiene and comfort.
In short, if any friends read this review, please don't hesitate. Any problems you have during your stay will be solved satisfactorily.

msg:Since I was deeply attracted by the Habsburg Hotel in Harbin last summer, I have been looking forward to setting foot in this land of ice and snow again in winter and experiencing the unique northern scenery. This time, I chose winter, hoping to feel the warmth and comfort of home again in this hotel, while enjoying the unlimited fun brought by ice and snow.

Stepping into the hotel lobby, a wave of warmth greets you, which is in sharp contrast to the severe cold of dozens of degrees below zero outside. The hotel's decoration is elegant yet modern, making people instantly forget the cold outside. When checking in at the front desk, the enthusiasm and professionalism of the staff made me feel like home.

Thanks for upgrading our room. The room we stayed in was spacious, bright and super spacious. The location was perfect so we could enjoy the snowy scenery outside. We were very satisfied with the complete facilities in the room, from the comfortable bed to the comfortable sofa. Especially the warm bathroom. Taking a warm bath in winter will make all the fatigue from playing during the day disappear, allowing us to feel rare comfort and relaxation in the cold winter.
The hotel's breakfast is also a highlight. There is a dazzling array of various delicacies, including Chinese food such as Harbin's special Internet celebrity fried cakes, etc., as well as Western-style bread, milk, and salad. Moreover, there are floor-to-ceiling windows in the breakfast room, allowing us to enjoy the food while admiring the snowy scenery outside. This is a rare experience.

The Habsburg Hotel Harbin was the perfect home for our winter trip. Not only did it provide a comfortable accommodation environment, it also allowed us to enjoy the unlimited fun brought by ice and snow. We believe that whether it is summer or winter, the Habsburg Hotel will be the most beautiful scenery in my heart.

Service: The restaurant manager, Huang Yanhua, is very nice to others. When we sit down, we will pour milk for the children and coffee for the adults. Also prepare after-dinner pudding for the children. We also packed snacks and fruits for the children to eat on the way. The most heart-warming thing was to learn that there was another person in the room who was sick with a cold due to the cold weather. He immediately ordered the kitchen to give him a bowl of red dates and ginger tea, saying that the locals would be happy to drink this, and there was also a bowl of white porridge to satisfy their hunger.
The aunt who cleans the corridors greets customers every day, which is comparable to a five-star hotel.
Environment: The staff will dress like palace maids and wear headdresses. It feels like walking into a palace
There is also free afternoon tea in the executive corridor every day and a cocktail or a cup of fruit tea in the evening, with a man on site.
Although there are not many things for afternoon tea, they are all local snacks and fruits. Very good for this price.

Facilities: hot water, complete heating, fruit plate, special snacks, biscuits, and Perrier water are given to us every night.
Even if there is no time to fold the clothes, they will help fold them. Very attentive, just like the Marriott I stayed at before. This makes me very satisfied
Hygiene: Very clean. The humidifier on the table is full of water in the morning, so I will wipe it clean. Vacuum floors. You can see that the toilet seat in the bathroom has been wiped with water, and you can only hear the cleaning lady gasping. It shows that people are really working hard.
Breakfast: Everything is quite complete, all of which are local tourist characteristics. For this price, I'm very satisfied

The taxi driver said this hotel is not cheap. I'd say it's okay and not very expensive. He said that local hotels at 300-500 are quite expensive.
When staying with children, you must have some environment and services. In addition to the fact that there is no children's playground where children can discharge their energy, if the hotel can simply create one. I think it can be better~

When I left, I gave a small gift and forgot to take pictures. If you check-in friends can see there is a small bag with a red bow under the Chris**as tree on the front desk, that is it. It is very suitable for little girls.
There are also dolls with the name of the hotel printed on them that can be taken back as souvenirs.

It is very convenient. The only drawback is that there is only one street at the door. There is a bit of noise at night due to the subway construction at the door, which may affect light sleepers or the elderly. In short, I am very satisfied and will choose Habsburg again in the future.

Visiting Harbin again after 5 years
Came here from Nanjing with my wife to celebrate the anniversary
The view from the room is very good. Downstairs is the cableway Songhua River. Although there is a construction site, it's not bad.
(I understand the eagerness of Harbin leaders, but the overnight construction of the subway in the tourist area this season is really a stumbling block for my family‚Äôs tourism revenue. Fortunately, the hotel windows are soundproof and equipped with earplugs)
After booking, he took the initiative to call us early the next morning to ask about our travel details and told us that the next day was our anniversary. When we returned to the room in the evening, we found that it had been carefully decorated for us. What was even more surprising was that a cake was specially prepared for us.
Every step during my stay made me, a colleague, admire me.
The front desk will thoughtfully prepare hot towels and hot tea for guests waiting to check in.
When encountering unreasonable customer complaints, the lady at the front desk will handle them gently and with ease.
The housekeeper you meet in the elevator will also say hello to the guests.
The service team at River View Restaurant chats with you like family members you haven‚Äôt seen for a long time.
The breakfast is rich in variety. It is recommended that you restrain your appetite in the morning. Otherwise, after breakfast at the hotel, you will basically only be able to eat one more meal throughout the day.
In addition, the price of red wine in the hotel is really too conscientious.
You can feel that the entire Habsburg team is united to operate and maintain this team. Their quality has far exceeded many star chains and domestic high-end hotels.
Thank you for your warm hospitality and I wish you can continue to improve and achieve great results in the future!

The River View Restaurant is located on the second floor. It has a wide variety of dishes and tastes pretty good. To be honest, it suits my taste better than Carlton's. What I especially admire is the service quality. He is proactive and candid. He is able to observe customers, communicate and take the initiative to understand their needs. Having so many multi-star hotels in so many places over the years is impressive and I hope it can be maintained.

It is very close to Central Street and the bank of Songhua River, but it is not noisy, the transportation is convenient, and it is quiet in the bustle. I received a call from the hotel as soon as I got off the plane, which was very reassuring. Hot coffee is also provided when checking in. The room environment is also very satisfactory, it is spacious and clean, the room is very warm, and there is a humidifier. I originally booked a four-night stay, but due to changes in my itinerary, I had to check out one day early. After contacting me through Ctrip, the hotel immediately refunded the room fee for one day without any hesitation. Afternoon tea is served every day, and snacks are delivered to the room in the evening. It was a very satisfying stay experience.

msg:The hotel is located in the center of the bustling city, very close to many internet celebrity check-in spots and tourist attractions. When staying in a hotel, you must choose a hotel close to the attractions. Is it really convenient? Save time and energy. The decoration of the hotel is very luxurious, the facilities and equipment are complete, and the service attitude of the staff is amiable. The breakfast in the hotel is really delicious. It is the first time for me to have breakfast in a hotel until 12 o'clock. It is very suitable for outing. The crowd was really great! The hotel also gives away coupons for afternoon tea and sightseeing ropeway, which is really considerate. My boyfriend and I have agreed to come back to Harbin to stay here in winter and go see the Ice and Snow World together!

When the robots are busy, hotel staff will also deliver them to the room. If necessary, the pick-up machine will ask you for flight information carefully. Especially when I left something behind when I checked out, the lady at the front desk called me to inform me and help me send it back. The hotel environment is great, the indoor environment is very designed, the facade decoration is very special and I like it. There is also a fish pond in the executive lounge on the first floor, and the room feels warm. The best choice if you come to Harbin in the future.

msg:Let‚Äôs just say that the staying experience is no less than that of a star hotel! I highly recommend everyone to choose this hotel when coming to Harbin.
First of all, the location is excellent. You will be 100 meters away from the Honghua River, 400 meters away from the Red Brick Street morning market, and 300 meters away from Central Street!
Secondly, the room was clean and the bedding was comfortable. I slept surprisingly well after being on a business trip to Harbin for three days.
In addition, the hotel staff are very nice. Although there is a subway building downstairs, they very considerately helped me choose a room on the inside, which is quiet. Every afternoon, someone puts refreshments in the room, including Dafu cookies and chocolates. The self-service laundry and drying on the third floor is also extremely convenient.
The last breakfast was awesome! On the first day I checked in, I was surprised to see the Northeastern specialty of stewed backbone with pickled cabbage! The whole thing is arrogant! Western pastries and Chinese food are all available. The staple food area includes Lanzhou ramen, pumpkin, corn, yam, and steamed buns, etc. My favorite is freshly ground coffee. A cup of espresso will refresh you all day long.
Habs is really good, I will continue to choose it next time I come to Harbin!

msg:The most surprising hotel with the best service during this trip to Yichun and Harbin. I called in advance before I even checked in, and placed children's toiletries and bed surrounds in the room as needed. When I arrived at the hotel, I was given welcome coffee, fruits and refreshments were placed in the room, and good night milk for three people was given before going to bed. Afternoon tea and breakfast are very rich. During breakfast, there is a warm waiter who helps make coffee, serve fruits, and serve special Tremella and pear water. The breakfast is open until 12 o'clock, which is even more exaggerated than a resort hotel in Sanya. When leaving the store, the enthusiastic Chef Jiao kept sending the luggage to the taxi across the road. The weather was quite cold, so I praised this dedicated service spirit. In short, the hotel's warm and thoughtful service added a lot to this trip. I will recommend it to my friends next time!

It gives me the feeling that the tourists staying in the hotel are really treated as family members and are taken care of in every possible way. On the first day, there were welcome snacks, which felt normal. It will be available every day for the next few days, and the quality is very good, which is rare. The laundry room is very clean and can be used. It is free when there is no limit. It's so convenient. The family room booked has two rooms with a door in the middle and each has its own door to the outside. This is rare. It means that you think about the needs of passengers, especially the actual situation of family travel, this is called attentiveness. The housekeeper is also very considerate and helps in various ways. This hotel is one of the few that our whole family, from the elderly to children, are very satisfied with. I will definitely choose this hotel again next time I go to Harbin.

Before we arrived, the front desk called us to ask if we had room requirements. As soon as we arrived at the hotel, a male waiter rushed out to help us carry our luggage and have breakfast. Waiter Liu Jinling served warmly, gave us mooncakes, and helped with fruits, yogurt, and pudding. It was so welcoming. When we changed rooms, the front desk made timely arrangements and asked the male waiter to pick up our luggage for us. We didn‚Äôt have to drag it ourselves.

You can take a walk at night to Central Street, Flood Control Monument, Binzhou Railway Bridge and the banks of the Songhua River. A castle in front is the cross-river cableway that leads directly to Sun Island. The transportation is convenient, with many bus stops around and not far from the subway station. The parent-child suite is spacious and is basically two separate rooms with a door in the middle. It is very suitable for adult children and parents to live together. The breakfast at the hotel was good, including local specialties such as pot-wrapped pork and dry croquettes. The service is very good, the hotel staff are very enthusiastic, and any troubles they have are solved quickly. A lady named Huang Yanhua is very active in the service and deserves praise.

The hotel room truck fee can be reduced by 7 yuan. Central Street, Harbin Museum, Stalin Park, Saint Sophia Church, Songhua River Binzhou Railway Bridge and other attractions can be reached on foot; the room area is large enough. It is large, the bedding is comfortable, and the 180-degree river view room has an excellent view. You can overlook Sun Island and enjoy the sunset; there are also novels to read in the room. Must praise the service and sincerity. On the day of check-in, the hotel housekeeper Jiawei knew the arrival time and check-in requirements in advance, and also established a service WeChat group to provide information such as catering and travel, and respond to guests' needs as soon as possible. The hotel's breakfast is rich in variety, and the catering waiter Liu Jinling's service is attentive, taking the initiative to help make coffee, get fruit plates and white fungus soup; the hotel provides fruit plates, refreshments and good night milk every day. In addition, the palace-style staff dress and hotel interior decoration are also a major feature, which is pleasing to the eye. The overall feeling is great and worth recommending.

Traveling is very convenient. Harbin is too big, and the attractions are a bit far apart. The location of the hotel is relatively good. It only takes less than ten minutes to walk to the cableway and the pier. Walk to Hongzhuan Street for about 15 minutes (the morning market is too early, I can't get up...) walk to Central Street for 15 to 20 minutes. The convenient transportation should be a big advantage of the hotel. The room we lived in couldn't see the river view, and the night view we saw was not very good, which is a pity.

The surrounding area is very close to Central Street, and it takes only 10 minutes to walk there; it is even closer to the Songhua River Cableway, just across the road, which is simply too convenient.

msg:A family of four went to Harbin to escape the summer heat. This hotel was selected on the Internet. I booked two rooms more than ten days in advance. On the day of departure, the hotel still called Ctrip to confirm our arrival time. When we arrived, the front desk assigned us to the 4th and 9th floors. And there is no room for negotiation. I prepaid the full amount 10 days in advance and confirmed my arrival at the store. Why can't I reserve two rooms next to each other, at least on the same floor? It is suggested that the hotel please improve this point. Fortunately, the service in the restaurant and the service on the floor are very good, which calmed down my previous "discomfort". In particular, Huang Yanhua, the food and beverage director of the restaurant, is warm and thoughtful, and the service is meticulous. He took the initiative to bring us food and drink, and communicated with the children. All the kids like her very much. Wang Hongzhen in the guest room on the 4th floor also provides warm and thoughtful service. Thank you all. The hotel is very close to the river. You can walk to Stalin Park by the river at night. Running in the morning or evening is also very good. The overall experience of staying is still very good.

The hotel provided tea break service in the executive lounge for three days. We met the same male waiter every day. This employee is the worst service in the hotel. No greeting no service after we went in. In the end, we gave him the afternoon tea voucher after the tea break, but there was no response.

The price has basically tripled, and the price is inflated, which is a bit outrageous. Because I took the old man and chose the vicinity of Central Avenue, the hotel marked Central Avenue, which is actually a certain distance from Central Avenue, and it takes 15-20 minutes to walk. The afternoon tea served by the hotel was tasteless and nothing to eat. The scariest thing is that the afternoon tea receptionist wipes the plates and cups directly with the rag that wiped the tableü§Æ, the room is not big, the family suite is booked, a large tea drinking table is completely useless, but you Paid the money, pit ah! There is a small circle of toilet paper in the bathroom every day, which is not enough for 3 people. It is said that it is a newly opened hotel in 2019, and the corridor carpet is dirtier than some hotels that have been open for 10 years. I don't know if it's a musty smell or some cheap perfume or essential oils. There is still a big gap between the quality and service and the international five-star. OK: The waiters greet you when they see you. Breakfast ramen tofu nao is delicious. 4 bottles of sparkling water, fruit, and refreshments are delivered to the room every day. But the snacks in the room are not very good. In short, the price/performance ratio is too poor, and I will not consider staying again in the future. Many international chain hotels in Songbei District are new and cheap

I was in a hurry to go out and didn't pay attention. When I came back in the evening, I found that the hygiene was really poor. There was dust in many places. My throat felt uncomfortable after staying there for a long time. There were many stains in the bathroom. There is a peculiar smell, that is, the smell of the dishcloth not being cleaned. It was too late to bother changing rooms, so I scrubbed it myself. It was twelve o'clock in the evening and the noise from the external construction was still very loud. Originally booked for three days, I immediately checked out and changed hotels the next morning.

The first thing we were greeted was a glass of ice-cold and delicious drink with a high value from the guy at the front desk.

It is very convenient to wash without disturbing each other. The hotel laundry and gym facilities are also well maintained. The location of the hotel is excellent, within a 10-minute walk you can reach Central Street, Flood Control Memorial Tower and Hongzhuan Street.
In particular, I want to mention the service of the hotel. Everyone is very enthusiastic, especially Liu Jinling in the restaurant.

In general, I feel very satisfied with the overall stay at the hotel, and I am well taken care of. I will continue to choose Habsburg when I come to Harbin in the future~

msg:It was the first time I came to the city of Harbin. To be honest, I was a little apprehensive before I came here. After all, in impressions and rumors, the folk customs of the Northeast are tough. But when I came to this hotel, I felt that the service in all aspects was very good. The hotel has a river view room where you can see the Songhua River. Every service staff is very enthusiastic, especially the person in charge of the restaurant named: Huang Yanhua. Professional ability, service attitude, and affinity have reached the level of my hotel stay in Japan. The professionalism of service personnel. It's not that Japan is so good, but their professional attitude is indeed recognized all over the world. This does not accept any refutation. The breakfast at the Habsburg Hotel is very rich, and the service staff are very considerate in all aspects. The room also considered the hot weather for the guests, and there were two bottles of water in the refrigerator. The reception staff in the lobby are also very warm, and there is a Sichuan restaurant outside the hotel. When I first checked in, I consulted the front desk clerk of the hotel, and explained the situation of the Sichuan restaurant to me in detail. I suggest that everyone who comes to Harbin can stay in this hotel, it is really good.

Service: The parent-child room I booked when I was staying in the hotel was not cleaned up. Seeing me holding my sleeping child, I was upgraded to a parent-child suite for free. The service staff helped us push the baby carriage into the room. When having breakfast in the morning, a service worker named Liu Jinling saw that it was inconvenient for us to bring a child, so he helped me prepare the baby chair and children's tableware, and also brought us yogurt, white fungus soup and other meals. He spoke gently and politely, generously and decently , Give her a thumbs up!

Hygiene: In the hotel, I have been walking barefoot all day, and my feet are clean. The carpets in the whole house can be seen to be cleaned very carefully.

Breakfast: rich!

Facilities: The gym and children's playground are very good!
Recommended, I will come back next time I come to Harbin.

We booked a river view room, the view is very beautiful, the room is very spacious, clean and hygienic, and the complimentary snacks are delicious. The hotel also has a specialty shop, the price is not expensive, and the chocolate is delicious. The hotel's breakfast is very rich, especially the ramen, rice noodles, and wontons made on site, which taste good.

The service of the hotel is great, warm and thoughtful, and Huang Yanhua, the food and beverage supervisor, even baked bread for us. The whole wheat bread is very soft. Because our train time is more than 2 pm, we were given a late check-out. The hotel is a bit noisy due to the subway construction outside the hotel. We arranged a high floor for us and specially prepared earplugs for the guests. Personally, I think it's actually okay, basically it won't be too noisy at night.

The overall feeling is very good, and I will stay here again next time I come to Harbin.

In particular, the hotel's service is absolutely top-notch and responsive. Special thanks to Mr. Huang Baoyu, the waiter at the front desk. On the first night after arriving at the hotel, the mobile phone malfunctioned and could not be used. At 23:00 in the evening, I got a phone call. The handsome guy Huang has been helping me with the operation. He also recommended nearby famous attractions and gourmet guides. I was very moved and felt the enthusiasm of the people of Harbin. In addition, the Habsburg Hotel is very close to the Flood Control Memorial Tower, Central Street, Hagia Sophia Cathedral and other attractions. There is also a delicious Shanhetun iron pot stew next door, which is a blessing. Next time I come to Harbin, I will definitely choose the hospitable Habsburg Hotel. Although it was a little accident, it left me with good memories.

Hygiene: very clean, no peculiar smell

Environment: I can feel that the location of this hotel is very good, but just in time for the subway construction in front of the door, so the current environment is a little bit worse, it seems that it will be repaired soon, and it will definitely be good when it comes, and it is very close to the river.

Service: As soon as we got off the bus, someone came to help with our luggage. All the staff were very polite and greeted us warmly when they saw us. It felt very good.

Russian-style leisurely afternoon tea: basically a simple buffet, there are two or three kinds of drinks, several small biscuits and fruits and vegetables~

Breakfast: There are many varieties of breakfast. Jenny, the supervisor of the restaurant, is very enthusiastic. She helps to bring yogurt and white fungus soup. Seeing a lot of people, she also offered to help us watch the seats and let us get the food. In addition, the other waiters were also very enthusiastic and offered to help make coffee and deliver it.

The overall feeling is good. If winter comes in the future, I will consider staying here.

The hotel is 200 meters away from the river in a straight line and very close to Central Street.

msg:1 Facilities: Our room is more than ten square meters smaller than others of the same room type. Maybe we are unlucky. The bed also feels small. For a family of three, we do not recommend a double bed room. It feels even smaller than the 1.8-meter bed at home. The heating in the room was really hot like summer. It was 29 degrees Celsius on the first night. It was dry and hot, and there was no comfort at all. The next day I asked the front desk if they could turn down the heating and was told there was no way. But the friend who stayed with us told us that we could ask the chef to turn off some radiators and ask for an electric fan.
2: Service: Compared with its price, I feel that there is no service. Basically equivalent to a convenience hotel. On the first day I checked in, I had to hold my child with my suitcase. The road was very slippery. There were service staff in the lobby, but they didn't take the initiative to help with the luggage. Just say hello and goodbye. I think it would be easier to just place a welcome doorbell. The day before I left, I found that I had forgotten to use my afternoon tea coupon. I asked the staff if I could take some desserts or small cakes with me in the morning. I was told that I couldn‚Äôt. I also asked if I could take some breakfast with me instead. Our flight was very early. I was also told that I couldn't... and I was told that you can always use this afternoon tea coupon... I was really speechless... Of course, there were no staff to help with my luggage when I left, and they would say goodbye.

During the stay, whether it was the room attendant on the 16th floor or the waiter in the restaurant (Cheng Cheng's little beauty), they served with a smile and enthusiasm throughout the whole process, making us feel at home. Habsburg Hotel not only has an excellent location, it is the best choice for travel and vacation, but also the interior decoration of the hotel is also very distinctive. Both the public area and the room environment are very clean and hygienic. The buffet breakfast is fresh and delicious, and the variety is also rich.

Da Lieba is crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, the beef noodles taste authentic, and the waiter Liu Jinling is warm and thoughtful. The hotel also sends homemade snacks every day to make guests feel at home.

msg:Service: I have been to Harbin many times, and the hotel I stayed in this time surprised me. In Habsburg, every employee is courteous, and the guests' requirements can be met as much as possible. Before check-in, the little beauty butler called me to ask me what I like about the room and when I will arrive at the store. After arriving at the store, the front office manager helped me arrange a room upgrade, which satisfied the child's desire to see the river view at night. After check-in, a fruit plate and refreshments were sent. After check-in, the heads of various depar**ents of the hotel established a service group. See the picture for details. I can find them in time for any problems. Of course, I didn't encounter any problems that needed to be solved.
We also enjoyed a casual afternoon tea. Goodnight milk is also arranged. The next day's breakfast is very rich, the key is that every kind of food is delicious, and there is no danger.
Huang Yanhua, the restaurant manager, helped us serve food, drinks, and coffee. The tremella soup was delicious. He also introduced us to the buildings outside the hotel window. Knowing that we will take the train later, we packed snacks, yogurt and fruit for the children to eat on the way.
I also sent two big Lieba when I left the store. Let me travel empty-handed but return with a rewarding experience.
Environment: The location of the hotel is very good, very close to the riverside and Central Street, it is very convenient for us to come back after playing on the riverside until midnight. The facilities inside are very complete, very clean and standardized. The gym and laundry room for kids are nice.
I used to think that the service of hotels in the north was not as good as that in the south. Habsburg surprised me. My daughter said that she would stay here again next time.
Every year, I take my children and the elderly to travel. This is the hotel I am most satisfied with in the past 5 years, not Trust.
Ps I am a person with a nervous breakdown, and I didn't feel noisy when I was building the subway.

msg:As a worker working in a five-star state hotel, I rarely praise other hotels, but the experience of staying this time is really pleasant. The location is very close to Central Street and the Flood Control Memorial Tower, near the Songhua River, a few minutes' walk away.
When booking a hotel, the front desk specifically called back to confirm the need for check-in and the approximate time of arrival, so as to make reservations.
There is its own parking lot in the backyard, which is very convenient. When entering the door, Mr. Dong, the security guard, offered to wash the car for free. Since it was still raining that night, he asked us when we left the store and told us to help us before we left. Great car wash.
When we checked in, the beautiful woman in Russian-style clothes at the front desk told us that we could upgrade to a 180-degree river view room for free, which was so beautiful. (The wax gourd water brought by the handsome guy must be drunk, it is quite delicious). You can enjoy the free afternoon tea directly on the first floor. Because it is a gift, so I don‚Äôt make too high a requirement. It would be perfect if it is like a handmade pastry for breakfast. .
Entering the room, a welcome snack has been prepared for the guests. The room is very large and spacious. Due to the subway construction outside the building during the day, the room specially prepared 3M earplugs for the guests, which is very thoughtful. The water pressure of the shower head in the bathroom is very strong, and the bath is very comfortable. The hand soap and shower gel are all Herm√®s earth fragrance, which smells the same as my perfume. There are also data cables for the guests on the night table, which are very detailed. The sound of the refrigerator is a little louder when sleeping at night. Because we put pastries and red bayberries in it, we did not unplug the power. If you don‚Äôt use it, it is recommended to turn off the power. The hotel can also consider putting the refrigerator in a cabinet with a cabinet door , a small suggestion.
The breakfast the next morning was amazing. The first time I stayed at the hotel, the breakfast was open until 12:00 noon. The dishes were quite rich, and they could be used as a lunch buffet, and they were delicious. The waiter Liu Jin introduced the dishes enthusiastically , Cheng baked bread for us, and brought us coffee and fruit. Looking at the river view, eating breakfast, how pleasant. Here is another small suggestion. Try not to touch the tableware directly with the placemat, and try not to expose the parts that are in direct contact with the air. Spoons and chopsticks can be placed on the chopstick rest, put on the chopsticks cover, or go to a fixed place Take your own cutlery.
After a hearty breakfast, we were still reluctant to leave the store. Mr. Dong, the security guard, had already washed the car for us. The sun was shining brightly, and he was already sweating profusely. We expressed our gratitude again.
The experience of staying this time is very good, the details are well done, and the service is superb. I will choose to stay again when I come to Kazakhstan next time.

When we were waiting for the car in the lobby, we missed a U-shaped pillow. We called and sent it back. The lobby staff took the initiative.

The room was renovated in 2019, and the facilities and equipment are very new. The bed in the room is moderately soft and hard. I don‚Äôt feel uncomfortable because I have a lumbar disc herniation. The pillow is a latex pillow. You can also call the service center to choose buckwheat husk and others. The hotel is equipped with complete and thoughtful small items, including a hand-held ironing machine, a stylish hair dryer, and even toothpicks and hair ties. The water from the shower head in the bathroom is very flushing, and the water is extremely smooth. There are charging cables and small refreshments in the room. The cleaning lady Xiu has a friendly service attitude, is serious and responsible, and the room is very clean. The hotel's breakfast is extremely rich, with a wide variety and new dishes every day. The small cold dishes are delicious. Master Feng, who makes ramen, is very skilled and has a very good service attitude. In order not to keep us waiting, he took the initiative to deliver it to our seats after making it. In particular, I would like to praise Xiao Kou in the cafeteria. He has a sense of active service and is a good employee with a job in his eyes. Hearing that the ramen with chili is a bit spicy, he took the initiative to bring us milk and lemon tea to relieve the spiciness. Seeing that we took fried dough sticks, they took the initiative to bring us freshly ground soy milk. This kind of service awareness shows that the hotel's training work is in place. We were on the train at 3:30 pm on May 11. On the evening of May 10, we called the front desk to ask if we could extend the checkout time to 2 pm. The front desk staff agreed decisively and with a kind attitude. When we checked out this afternoon, we asked Who was the staff who extended the stay in rooms 1105 and 1107 last night? The front desk said it was Zhang Yanan last night. He left in a hurry today and didn't have time to say thank you.
If you have friends who go to Harbin for travel and business, it is right to choose this hotel.
Forgot to mention that there is also afternoon tea available.

However, there is construction going on downstairs, so it will be a bit noisy during the day. The hotel's toiletries smell super nice, woody.

As soon as I arrived, I found that there were hairs on both beds. Although they called and changed them immediately with a very good attitude, it was still a bit awkward.

Serve:
I stayed for five nights in total and on the last day of my temporary extension, I didn‚Äôt have breakfast included. I didn‚Äôt enjoy all the three breakfasts every day for the first few days. I thought about communicating with the front desk to help me add a breakfast, but before I could finish my words, he just asked me to add breakfast. No. Communicate that the maximum delay for check-out is one o'clock. After staying in so many hotels, this is the first time I see that they are only allowed to arrive until one o'clock. Usually it is at least two o'clock. When staying at other hotels, the front desk will directly tell them to delay the check-out if they know that the departure time is late and have a good rest. .
Generally speaking, the room service is good, but the front desk service is very rigid, inflexible and stiff.

facility:
The temperature of the bath water is unstable. It may suddenly change to cold water or smoking hot water while washing. Be careful.

It is recommended to go to the iron pot stewed goose at the back at noon, and there are more people queuing at night. I have formed an indissoluble bond with the hair dryer in this hotel.

The bathroom floor drain is blocked! Dirty old carpets in the corridors and rooms! It is obvious that the three people staying in the suite are only given two breakfasts, and they have to pay extra for it. How could you be so shameless to charge 2,400 for a room and then charge for breakfast? ! Is it a backend or a customer related to Ctrip? I don‚Äôt know how you got such a high rating? Look at other people's genuine five-star hotels, how dare you charge higher prices than others? If I didn't have time, I would really think of reporting it to the industrial and commercial enterprises! I hope fewer people will be deceived! There is simply no justice! The price is about 2000 less! I also want to report it to Ctrip. Aren‚Äôt you going to investigate and check it? Self-destruct sign? No need to block my comments! I will keep sending it!

The afternoon tea provided is handmade biscuits and fruits, and there is hot milk in the evening. The aunt who cleans the floor is also very good. Before check-in, the front desk specially called to confirm the children's slippers and toothbrushes. They also gave lemons when they checked in. Winter melon tea, super delicious! ! When leaving the store, I also sent two Lieba. The parent-child room we stayed in can still see the night view of the bridge at night. There is a specialty supermarket downstairs that is enough to buy souvenirs. The chocolate meat joint factory has red sausage milk powder and so on. The room service is also good. The millet porridge ordered is still hot.
The only regret is that the child fell ill immediately after arriving in Harbin. The front desk also helped to extend the check-out time and opened a half-day room.
However, the bathroom pipes in one of the parent-child rooms we booked are particularly smelly. It may be that the sewer pipes were not very good when the house was built, but the flaws are not hidden.

ÔøºIn addition, there are various toys in the room, such as a tent, a small piano, a small guitar, a little white rabbit that can tell stories, and many books suitable for different age groups .

I checked out around 6:30 am on the 26th and went to the airport to take an early flight. I fell asleep when I got in the taxi. After half an hour, the front desk called and asked me if I had hand sanitizer and laundry detergent. Why didn‚Äôt I get it when I checked out? After the on-site rounds, ask me to confirm? Also, from the first day I moved in until I left, I have never seen laundry detergent or hand sanitizer, and my underwear is washed with shower gel. I really want to complain about your room staff, I am speechless.

Is this the bed and pillows of a five-star hotel? The worst five-star hotel experience so far, it is recommended to remove the star rating, and it is a thing to wrestle with a certain famous hotel
The service staff are very unprofessional. They just came to the front desk after graduation. They didn‚Äôt do any pre-job training, right? It‚Äôs recommended to put a robot there. It doesn‚Äôt make any difference anyway.

The day before we checked in, a big-eyed front desk girl helped us upgrade the room. The whole communication upgrade, including the process of showing us the room, was enthusiastic and professional. Praise
The location of the hotel is very good. It is very convenient to go to places to eat and attractions. Attractions include: Central Street, Hagia Sophia, Ice and Snow Carnival are all within a few steps, and Ice and Snow World is not far from a taxi
It's minus 20 ‚ÑÉ outside every day and I come back after staying for a long time. When I come back and enter the room, it's spring. It's very comfortable, but it's a bit dry to sleep at night. Everyone pay attention to moisturizing
The breakfast is very rich, Harbin's big red sausage, big mixed vegetables, stir-fried, meatballs, and fried chicken. My favorite is the ramen from the chef at the door. The soup is clear and fragrant, and the noodles are somersaulting. I have two bowls a day Ha ha
On the last day of check-out, the young man at the door helped carry the luggage to the car, he was still enthusiastic and professional
If you come to Harbin next time, you don‚Äôt need to swipe to choose a hotel, you can choose Habsburg with confidenceüòä
By the way, you can see the frozen Songhua River outside the hotel window, it is firm but not cold

msg:If I were to evaluate this hotel in one sentence, I think it is the hotel I will choose again when I come to Harbin for business trips or pleasure.
At the beginning, I chose this hotel mainly because of its prime location. Crossing the road is the Sightseeing Jiangshan Cable Car. You can walk to Central Street in 5 or 6 minutes. It is very convenient whether it is to check in landmark buildings, eat authentic Madrid, go shopping, and buy specialty products. The surrounding transportation is also very convenient. It is easy to take a taxi and bus lines. There are also many.
The other thing I want to like crazy is his service. Because of my work, I have stayed in a lot of hotels, large and small, but his service is really attentive and meticulous. When I checked in at the front desk, my little brother prepared lemonade for me. He was very careful! Because this is a business trip to Harbin, I booked an ordinary room with no view of the river. The little brother at the front desk specially upgraded me with a river view room and reminded me that I am repairing the subway. If I think it is noisy, I can close the window. Feel free to contact the front desk.
I have to say that the view of the river view room is really great! The wide view is also super beautiful~ Originally, I was more worried about the noise problem mentioned by my little brother, but I didn‚Äôt expect it to be non-existent hahaha. I stayed for two days. The room was very quiet. The service of the room sister was also great. The room was always cleaned. It‚Äôs very clean, disinfected every day, and there are mineral water, wafers, and yogurt. It‚Äôs very considerate~
Finally, there is an additional bonus item. The recent Harbin epidemic is very serious. I was actually quite worried when I was on a business trip at this time. But the epidemic prevention of this hotel is really good! The lobby, elevators, and rooms are disinfected many times a day. I have also met aunts who disinfected several times. They have done very meticulously, so that I can feel at ease as a guest. In addition, I also had some takeaways during my stay. In order to avoid unnecessary contact, the hotel also asked cute robot attendants to deliver my takeaways to the door of the room, and they were also disinfected, which made me feel safe!
All in all, this staying experience is really a little amazing to me~ I recommend that babies who come to Harbin can also pick his house~

Every time I go to Harbin in winter, I have to grab the tail of summer this time. I came here specially in August, wanting to experience summer in Harbin. Regarding accommodation, I booked the Habsburg Hotel on a temporary basis for the convenience of playing. I didn‚Äôt expect the experience of staying in such a good one. It was a surprise! It sits on a 180-degree invincible river view and easily overlooks the entire Songhua River. The bedding in the room is clean and comfortable. The toiletries are all from the British brand Seven Plus Tanyun series. The guest room provides a Mini bar, humidifier, etc., which is very warm!
Especially in terms of service, it is very impressive! I upgraded our room when we checked in. The front desk and lobby staff were very helpful. The subway was being repaired nearby and there was some noise. The staff kept explaining to us and sorry. Make me feel at home!
 The location of this hotel is also very good. Crossing the road is the Songhua River Crossing Cableway, and you can go directly to the Sun Island on the opposite bank. It is about 10 minutes' walk from Central Street, which is very convenient!

Room: Upgrade to a suite, excellent value for money, large room area, great view, high standards of hygiene, good quality bedding, large bathroom space, and professional tea room equipment.
The self-service laundry room is very suitable for me who is running every day and washing clothes every day. The laundry room is clean, equipped with sufficient equipment, and equipped with books and sofas, which is very convenient.
Breakfast: I came back late from the run and asked to take it to the room. The restaurant was very cooperative. In terms of the quality of meals, the price/performance ratio far exceeds that of international brands in a certain city where I lived two days ago. The waiter on the 8th floor was active and enthusiastic, and brought me a lot of hangers to dry my clothes.
As a person in the industry, although many hotels use intelligent equipment to serve, when I always think that the human service provided by hotel staff is the warmest place in a hotel, this is vividly reflected in Habsburg, from the concierge to the front desk. From the guest room to the restaurant, every employee is full of enthusiasm. It can be seen that they love their work.
Waiting for me in Harbin in winter, it will be Habsburg next time

msg:Points to be praised: 1. Very good location: 1 intersection from Central Avenue, 150 meters from the Songhua River, very close. 2. The breakfast price is low and the variety is abundant: 48 yuan per person, the variety is very rich and great. 3. Very good service: butler-style one-to-one service, very considerate. The hallway hygienists also greet them at any time, with a very good attitude.
Disadvantages: The aisle of the room is too low, the room is considered clean, but the carpet must have been cleaned, but it looks dirty. The toilet has water stains.

msg:1. The location is very good. It is only 500 meters away from Central Street, about five minutes. 2. The service is great. The in and out service staff all smile sincerely to the guests, and the problems raised by the guests can be solved quickly. 3. The decoration is great, and the items used are also very high-end. Absolutely super five-star experience. The rooms are new, comfortable and modern. 4. At present, the subway is under construction on Youyi Road in front of the hotel, and it will be more convenient to get the subway in the future. Very satisfied, a satisfying accommodation experience beyond imagination. I will never stay in other hotels when I come to Harbin in the future. This is better than the Shangri-La experience.

msg:I gave it the first bad review essay
Let me talk about the advantages first
1: Most of the service staff have a warm attitude, which makes people feel warm
2: Because of the downstairs construction, the room was upgraded for free, and the room is comfortable
shortcoming
1: Embarrassing location: It takes more than ten minutes to walk over from Central Street and the church. It takes more than ten minutes. It is very painful in the hot summer. If you choose to take a taxi, the starting price is not enough, and there are fewer masters who take orders.
2: Strange parking space: Unlike ordinary hotels, the car can be parked directly in front of the hotel. This hotel is located at a T-junction. Taxis cannot approach the hotel. Guests need to carry their luggage and get off the bus from the middle of the road and walk to the hotel. Similarly, when calling a car when going out, the driver dare not stop at the door of the hotel. For fear of breaking the rules, the guests need to walk to the middle of the road and get on the car.
3: The subway construction downstairs, the noise is deafening and annoying
So far, the whole thing has been flawless, but its lobby bar still opened my eyes.
4: I wanted to come to the lobby bar to chat with my friends. At first, there was no waiter. After waiting for a while, a lady with wet hair in a colorful t-shirt and shorts picked us up. My friend wanted a bottle of Yiquan. She replied: "We don't sell mineral water here." But the water is in the freezer. I pointed it to her and she replied: "Oh, that's soda water." The problem is that we just want Yiquan soda? Also, if you don‚Äôt sell water, shouldn‚Äôt you give your guests a glass of water? After not doing her job well, she kept asking us if we wanted fruit plates and cakes. But because we haven't seen each other for a long time and didn't want to waste time, we didn't change places.
After that, I ordered a cup of iced latte. The taste was indescribable, like a cup of ice-water mixture‚ûï a spoonful of milk and a spoonful of milk froth, without the taste of coffee at all.
During the chat, I crawled over a money string at my feet, and I was shocked that I forgot to take a picture. (Attach a photo from Baidu Check) I hope that friends who will go to the lobby bar will help me see this gray money string Are still there.
At the checkout, the third waiter was changed. Instead of showing the consumption bill, he told me to spend more than 80 yuan. After the payment was over, I asked him for the bill from the fourth waiter. Sure enough, I didn‚Äôt order the Coke. Appeared on the bill, all bills are handwritten, without price tags, which is confusing. And the male waiter said to me confidently: Anyway, water and Coke are the same with more than 20 yuan, no difference. I also don't know what to say to him, I hope he can improve the definition of hotel service standards.
Finally, let‚Äôs make a comment. It‚Äôs 2022, and the premium for hotel drinks can be so big. The disgusting coffee in a little-known hotel is more than 50? Before at Four Seasons or Park Hyatt, a cup of standard-quality coffee only cost more than 40 pieces, as well as a biscuit and lemonade, and they can provide a hotel-style signing service.
The wonderful trip to Harbin has thus drawn an imperfect end.

This is the first time I give a negative review. There is basically no way to communicate. Each depar**ent is pushing the blame with each other. Maybe it is because I come here often.

The free coffee in the lobby is great and must be drunk when coming in and out. It is very convenient to be within a ten-minute walk from Central Street and the cruise ship pier. Check-in and check-out procedures The room was quickly upgraded and the free upgrade was very good. It was very comfortable to sit in the multiple living rooms and watch TV and drink drinks. The breakfast was not bad. Unfortunately, there were no freshly made omelets. In summary, it was a pleasant stay.
