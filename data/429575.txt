Comfy bed! 
The staff also arranged wine and flowers in the room as I booked the hotel for me and my husband for our weeding anniversary.
We were also granted a late check out at 2pm which was perfect for us to leave and get our train at 3:30.

We will definitely be back!

We arrived in the morning and the rooms were prepared for us so that we could use them straight away. It was clean and there was a healthy welcome snack. The breakfast buffet was breathtaking. It's a shame that you get so full so quickly that you can't try everything. The staff were very friendly and courteous.
We had a room with a river view and the lights in the evening were beautiful. Definitely recommendable. Thank you!

The butlers Xiao Luo and Vicky who received us were very professional and the service was very thoughtful. The snowflake crisp gift box in the room was already prepared, and the fruits were very good. Xiao Luo was also very considerate. He helped us apply for a river view room and connected the two rooms. The communication between the two rooms was very smooth. The river view room has a very good view. I recommend it to everyone. The only point that needs to be improved is that the time on the clock in the room is not right. I hope the people at houseKeepin can adjust it in time. In addition, the drainage of the sink is a bit slow. When the faucet is turned on, all the accumulated water cannot be drained in time. I hope this problem can be solved. The water from the shower is very fast. I like the bathroom bathtub in the room very much.

I received her call before checking in, and added her on WeChat to help me prepare some supplies in the room in advance. Knowing that it was my first time in Ningbo, she also arranged a room with a very good view for me, which could have a panoramic view of the entire Sanjiangkou. During my stay, I asked her about nearby restaurants, and she was very thoughtful to introduce me to several nearby delicacies for my reference. I am very grateful for her service, which made my trip very pleasant. If I have the opportunity to come again, I will still choose Shangri-La~

The hotel is very close to Jiangxia Bridge East and East Gate on Line 1, and can be reached in about 10 minutes on foot. It is very convenient to get there. The East Gate subway station is Tianyi Square, which has a strong commercial a**osphere and is fully equipped with food, drink and entertainment. The hotel service is very good, the sanitation is very clean, the room glass is also very clean, and the view is wide. Insufficient, it is recommended that the hotel improve: 
1. The road construction at the entrance of the hotel, the navigation usually leads to the entrance of Yangliu Street, but this road is very narrow, and it will be a bit nervous when two cars meet. It will be more relaxed to enter from the Baizhang Road entrance. It is recommended that the hotel have a prompt at the entrance of Yangliu Street. 
2. The hotel room is equipped with a charging cable, but the speed is very slow, there are very few sockets on both ends, all are three-pin sockets, and there are very few sockets that can be plugged into the mobile phone plug, which is very inconvenient. 
3. There are DVDs from the last century in the room, which is really meaningless. It is better to improve the charging facilities. 
4. There is a bed in the room, but it cannot be opened. It depends on air conditioning for ventilation. The carpet still has a bit of smell. 
5. The breakfast coffee machine did not work properly for three consecutive days. The waiter had to make coffee in the backstage.
6. I booked three nights, which included breakfast for two adults every day for three days. There was no problem on the first two days, but on the third day, the waiter said there was only breakfast for one person. I don't know why. There was no problem on the first two days, but it didn't work on the third day. Although it was properly resolved, as a five-star hotel, such a mistake is puzzling.

🏠 Ningbo Shangri-La Hotel

📍No. 88 Yuyuan Street, Yinzhou District, Ningbo

🚗Parking lot available (hotel room)

Location-near the Old Bund in Ningbo, you can see the magnificent view of the confluence of three rivers in the hotel. The night view is even better.

The front desk service attitude is very good👍 Very patient to help me check in. A breakfast coupon worth 128 was also given. My room is on the 33rd floor of the Deluxe Pavilion River Room and I can choose to dine on the 2nd floor or on the 28th floor. There are few people dining on the 28th floor, the environment is great, and it is very quiet. The view outside the window at night is super beautiful and overlooks the Sanjiangkou. The room includes self-service double breakfast and afternoon tea☕️ In the morning, there are various kinds of milk, yogurt, juice🍹 and fruits, cakes, and many kinds. The small cake is delicious! It's a pity that I checked in at 8 o'clock and couldn't enjoy the buffet.

-There is Tianyi Square nearby, which is very convenient for shopping and leisure. It is not far from Tianyi Pavilion, Ningbo Museum, Drum Tower and Tianfeng Tower, and it is only a ten-minute drive away.

Hotel Features:

- As a five-star hotel, it has luxurious facilities and equipment, and a five-star service concept. It is very suitable for business people, and customers are always the top priority.

- In addition to basic hotel services, there is also a Deluxe Club Executive Lounge, and a special floor provides quieter and more meticulous services. Afternoon tea is provided in the morning, noon and evening, which is free for customers above the Deluxe Club and hotel members, and other customers

I really think it’s good 👍 The price is very affordable. It’s very comfortable to stay. Love it 🫶 Highly recommended

This time I came with my friend. During my stay, I would like to thank Michael, the concierge, for helping us carry our luggage and greeting us as soon as we entered the hotel. It was great! He also recommended delicious restaurants for us. The enthusiasm and efforts of the service staff allowed us to quickly adapt to the environment in the hotel. Thank you for the convenience and comfort you brought to us. I wish the hotel business will prosper.

Every staff member of the hotel is amiable, meticulous and thoughtful. Especially the young man Dai Chao from the concierge depar**ent, who always answered our questions and gave a very detailed introduction. In the end, he even sent us to the elevator door of our garage. The hotel's hardware and location are great, and the service is even better!

The service was very meticulous. The staff greeted the guests warmly when they met in the corridor. There were a lot of people during the May Day holiday. I could feel that the hotel was doing its best to serve every guest. We had both old and young people, and the hotel provided very good service.
I would like to especially thank Lori and Queen, two staff members, for bringing our Ningbo Shangri-La to a successful conclusion. I hope to have the opportunity to stay at Ningbo Shangri-La again. The location is excellent. It is 2 stops away from Tianyi Pavilion and Yuehu Lake. The hotel is at the crossroads of Sanjiangkou, which is very convenient.

Luxury Club VIP trea**ent: The breakfast was average, which needs to be improved. I went to the restaurant at around 9 o'clock, and there were not many people. The food was a little cold. The service of the restaurant staff was still very enthusiastic and they asked if I needed help in a timely manner.
Facilities: The shower in the room felt a bit unworthy of the quality of this 5-star hotel. It was just the most ordinary shower, and the water pressure was quite low.
Environment: The surrounding facilities are still OK, the shopping malls and attractions are very close, and the raw pickles that come to Ningbo to check in are also very good.

There are doormen to open the car door and carry the luggage. The room is large and has a bathtub. The most luxurious in the same price range, cheaper than the small hotels on the island.
I booked an ordinary room, and during the May Day holiday, the customer service depar**ent also upgraded the hotel room to a river view room. Fruits and snacks and candies were given in the room. A big thumbs up👍👍👍
It is very close to the Old Bund and Tianyi Pavilion, only 1km, and you can walk there. There are so many delicious foods, and you can fly drones on the Old Bund.
Located in the city center, it is a bit far from Chiang Kai-shek's former residence, with more than 40 red lights.

msg:The hotel is located at the intersection of three rivers, with a unique geographical location, unparalleled river views and the city skyline, and close to various historical attractions. Although it is a well-established five-star hotel, the hotel and room hardware facilities are well maintained, high-end and clean. Chen Shengnan, the hotel's duty manager, was very warm and considerate to the guests. He took the initiative to help us arrange a room on a higher floor and sent us fruits, snacks and a small map, and sent us to the room, making us feel like we were being taken care of by our children at home. The buffet breakfast is rich in variety and the dining environment is elegant... Insufficient aspects: lack of some intelligent facilities, such as smart toilets that have been close to tens of millions of households and have become a necessity of life. If this facility is replaced, it may improve the market competitiveness of the hotel.

Taking a taxi in Ningbo is not expensive, and it is very close to Tianyige and Yuehu, so I didn’t take the subway. You can walk to Laowaitan, where there are many music bars, which is quite quiet on weekends. There are a lot of snacks in Gulou, and a taxi only costs a few yuan.

   I dragged my exhausted body back from Tibet. The journey was full of beauty and surprises, and I returned to my favorite Ningbo Shangri-La Hotel.

  The moment I arrived at the hotel and got off the bus, I felt extremely relaxed and could finally have a comfortable sleep... I felt that all my moods and fatigue could be relieved here... The interior of Shangri-La Hotel brought people a sense of excitement both mentally and visually. It’s a very comfortable a**osphere…

I checked in in the evening and dragged my exhausted body to the room. I slept well that night, but at some unknown time in the morning, there was a thumping sound coming from the next door. Once...twice... I woke up and had to find a way to fall asleep again... Finally, I couldn't bear it anymore and called the front desk☎️Please don't book a room now... I explained that I was very tired and needed to sleep... After a while, there was no sound... During this period, I ordered something that needed to be delivered to the door of the room. I told the guest room aunt that I If you want to renew your stay and need to apply for pre-approval, please don’t call me to disturb my rest...I’m going to sleep and I’m about to fall asleep after that.
  Maybe I forgot to type dnd. "Dang dang dang, hello..." outside the door... The feeling of being suddenly awakened when I was about to fall into deep sleep made me confused. I got up feebly and walked to the door to open it. There was The things the service staff was carrying...I was in a very good mood at this time...but I thanked her for her concern and quickly thanked her. After all, it was very troublesome to get some supplies. The main reason was to extend my stay and I didn't want to stay or go out to do anything else. I just wanted to sleep well. Sleep……

Service: The guy at the front desk was very enthusiastic and professional. He didn’t have to wait too long.

   The room facilities are a bit outdated, but the cleanliness is still sufficient. There is just no coffee machine. I thought it would be equipped with capsules just like the executive suite I stayed in last time. This time I brought some daily food from home, but it turned out that I didn't use it.
    I don’t know if it’s because of the New Year or if it’s just mediocre. The breakfast in the hotel is very ordinary and some of the meals are not hot enough. I can only say that I’m a bit sorry for the price.
    I ordered Xiang’s New Year’s Eve dinner for four people. Well, it was really bad. The air conditioning in the hall was not fully functioning, so it always felt very cold. The food became cold not long after it was served. The food is really mediocre. If I wasn't too lazy to go out, I really wouldn't want to have New Year's Eve dinner here.
   There were two bottles of drinks on each table. I ordered four cups of milk tea, so I didn’t drink it. I wanted to drink some when I went back to the room to watch the Spring Festival Gala. Unexpectedly, the waiter stopped me and said that it was sent by the hotel, but he could only wait in the hall. Food. Well, in theory, it's only a bottle of Coke, which is quite embarrassing. Well, you can still consider it next time you stay, just eat here.

msg:It’s the holiday before the Spring Festival. I want to give myself a holiday, and I also want to bring a Coke to have fun together! I booked the Ningou Family Room in Ningbo Shangri-La. This room really exceeded my expectations for a parent-child room! !
The entire guest room has their own parent-child theme. Because we booked a suite, the living room is a large private play area, and the children can play endlessly in the room. Coupled with the colorful and cute muddy theme of the bedroom, we really didn’t want to go to bed until 10:00 at night and wanted to play some more.
This is not the point between the rooms that I think is outstanding. I think the most important part is that this room really has a lot of thoughtful details for the children. For example, there are play facilities in the room, such as footstools for children, slippers for children, bathrobes for children, and even bath toys and bath seats for children. Every time we travel and stay in a hotel with Coca-Cola, we are actually very tired when we bathe the children in the bathtub. The first reason is because there is no place for parents to sit down, and the second reason is that the children are in the bathtub and they are really tired. It is easy to slip and fall. Even using the hotel's anti-slip mat is very dangerous, because the area where children can move will be much larger than that of the anti-slip store. But this time when we checked in, the room provided a bathing seat. Sitting in the seat firstly secures the child, and secondly, he will not slip when he stands up. In addition, with the company of bath toys, and the child's step stool, parents can sit by the bathtub. Taking a shower really frees up my old mother's waist. These facilities can really help parents relax while traveling. There is also a singing night light in the bedroom. Children will feel a little uneasy when sleeping in a new environment. Put on the night light and turn on the light to shine on the ceiling. The children will slowly relax. I think this design Also very considerate.
Finally, I have to say that the buffet breakfast really satisfies the traditional taste buds of Ningbo people. There are rice cakes, tofu curd, noodles, fried dumplings, and even glutinous rice balls for eating early in the morning! Even if I have a stomach for Western food, I can enjoy the meal as there are freshly baked desserts and croissants in the morning. You can also refresh yourself with a latte!
In addition, there is a large amusement park outside the restaurant, and the children can't move there until it rains in the past two days, so there is no place to play outdoors. Inside the hotel, I didn't expect that the children can play Completely released! I really like this hotel and this family room. Next time I have a vacation, I can bring my kids here to relax and relax by myself🥳🥳🥳

However, the hotel staff made up for its shortcomings by giving us "home away from home" and thoughtful service from the concierge, front desk, guest rooms, and restaurants. Special praise should be given to Mr. Zhou, the hotel customer relations officer, who upgraded the room for free before we even checked in, and also gave us fruits and glutinous rice balls.

The play area on the second floor is like an ocean world with complete facilities. My child likes it very much. The waiters were warm and friendly, and they also gave us super cute supplies. I will definitely stay here again next time

msg:I took my children to stay in the parent-child suite of Ningbo Shangri-La Hotel during the winter vacation. My children liked it very much. The hotel is very considerate for families. The children's tableware, towels, and children's utensils are all well prepared according to the theme, whether it is the cartoon design inside the room or the theme supporting facilities. The content is all great. The night view of this hotel (I was told it is the best place to view Sanjiangkou in the local area) is also very good. What you see during the day is a black and white photo, but at night it becomes a colorful painting.
My personal suggestion is that if you travel to Ningbo with your children and family, you can choose the in-person suite at Ningbo Shangri-La as your first choice.

I told the girl at the front desk that I had a Shangri-La membership and she upgraded me. Ctrip members do not have an advantage.
Breakfast was ok, average, cheese was good.
Although the hotel is old, it is well maintained and the rooms are very clean. If you have time, you can upgrade the hotel's facilities.
Parking is directly on the second underground floor and is free.
There is a famous snack shop nearby, so you can buy some.
Visitors who come for fun can go to Yongshang Mingzao to eat, which is cheap and delicious. There are parking spaces around, and parking costs 5 yuan for 1 hour and 45 minutes.
The river view is quite beautiful. I will come to Ningbo if I have the chance.

Hotel services can meet your requirements before and during your stay. Several times when I met the staff cleaning the rooms on the floor, they took the initiative to say hello and asked if they had any needs, and provided timely feedback and implementation. The night shift front desk staff the previous night also had a good sense of service. I forgot to bring my earplugs and called the front desk. The staff asked if it was because of the noise and immediately came to the door and gave me three pairs of earplugs. The actual room was very quiet. It would be better if a rose could be added to the room decoration. I met a family before and thought it was very warm.

Especially their new butler service is very good. Unlike some hotels that have this butler, they either don't respond quickly enough or don't solve the problem.
This time it was housekeeper Xiao Zhou (Zhou Jingsong). He was able to follow up 24 hours a day. He solved the problem in a timely and attentive manner, and handled all the imperfect details that had just arrived. Also, if I have a car that the driver doesn’t park in the garage, he will remind me. There were some problems with the room, and he immediately helped me change rooms.

Shangri-La has always been my favorite brand. Compared with other cities, I feel that the service staff at Ningbo Shangri-La are full of energy and work hard.

This time my father was ill and hospitalized. I was very nervous and had many things to deal with. Thank you to the hotel and Xiao Zhou for your service, which made me feel at home and very heartwarming.

I will continue to choose to stay here next time, and I hope the hotel's high-quality service can be maintained.

msg:Service: The service is as bad as Shanghai Yuyuan Renaissance and Dalian Intercontinental!
Arrived at 2 o'clock to check in, after waiting for several hours, check-in was successful! If it weren’t for the Ctrip housekeeper’s communication, I guess no one would pay attention to me, right? Finally, I upgraded the room and found that it was still a connecting room. The lady in the guest room even pushed an extra bed. I didn’t want to bother others and didn’t change to what they said was better... The hotel also swore to reply, "The hotel has connecting rooms, and there are only a few rooms on each floor." "Every room is not"...Is this standard for international chains? It is recommended to withdraw the license! When I have time, I will also write emails to the headquarters with suggestions.

Facilities: Not perfect, as can be seen from the breakfast. Normally there is a long queue for breakfast on the second floor. It is recommended to go to the first floor for the same meal... I also asked if it is the same as upstairs? Pretty much the answer! It's obviously much worse! Take a look at the food on the first floor... Compared with hotels of the same level in other cities... the second floor is obviously better. Although it is still worse compared to other cities, its price is low, only 128 yuan per person. The same brand in other cities is average. It's 198. Remember that breakfast for children over 6 years old is charged, and it is also half price for the next few days.

Although the hotel has been open for a long time, the room maintenance is quite good, the environment is clean and tidy, the room service is timely, and the attitude is also very good. The bath water is also very large and it is very comfortable to wash. The breakfast variety is quite satisfactory, with a lot of vegetables and Ningbo glutinous rice balls.

From the first second after getting off the bus, the concierge guy greeted me with a smile and carried my luggage. (This is the first impression given to guests, but many five-star hotels actually ignore it.) The front desk staff patiently inquires about guests' needs and explains all services clearly. Breakfast was very rich and delicious. Restaurant service and room service are well-trained, efficient and fast.

Amber upgraded to a river view room for free, which allows you to overlook and take pictures of Sanjiangkou, and also provides welcome snacks and fruits. Special thanks! The breakfast is worthy of the price and is quite rich. The big meat buns are especially delicious and feel like a long absence. There is a small courtyard behind the building where you can take a walk. What needs special praise is the indoor heated swimming pool. The water is clean, the water temperature is comfortable, there are not many people, and the opening hours are long. I contacted and swam three times, and it was very pleasant. It takes more than ten minutes to walk to Laowaitan Pedestrian Street. The restaurants and bars are very good. The old churches and old buildings are very impressive. There are also many young people who are willing to perform and have good singing skills singing in the open air, highlighting Ningbo's literary and artistic style. If I come to Ningbo again, I will consider staying at Shangri-La again!

Result 2: The front desk phone number could not be reached directly in the room, and was transferred through the service center. Even the two front desk phone calls were not answered! After I made my request to the service at noon, the manager on duty called and there were no other twin rooms available! Then say sorry! Send a piece of fruit to the room (I booked two rooms at the time, and the colleague in the other room said that the fruit was already in the room as soon as she entered the room...in fact, the fruit should have been there)...Okay! This duty manager is as good as you can be! The check-in experience is mediocre in terms of hardware and mediocre service! 3: When booking a room, the hotel configuration clearly showed that there was an electronic scale, and before check-in, I also made a note that the room required an electronic scale. However, I searched the room for a long time the next morning and couldn't find it, so I communicated with Ctrip, and the room staff sent an electronic scale. I just asked you, don’t you have an electronic scale in your room? The answer was: No...Okay! The housekeeping staff are not well trained, and they don’t know the minimum configuration of the rooms they clean? Afterwards, the hotel guest management manager called me to inquire about my stay experience, and I truthfully informed the above three points! The check-in experience is indeed very average! Even a little bad! But I still want to thank the guest relations manager for patiently listening to me explain the whole process and saying that he would strengthen the training of employees! After all, Shangri-La is one of the top ten hotel brands! It is really a pity that such a service situation occurs!

The hotel is located here in Sanjiangkou, and the scenery during the day and at night is very nice.

msg:Finally, I came to Ningbo with a three-day vacation. I received a call from the housekeeper Xiao Zhou on the high-speed rail and added WeChat. If you have any problems, you can contact us at any time to solve the problem. After arriving at the hotel, we went directly to the Horizon Club on the 28th floor to check in. We received a warm reception and were responsive to our requests. And sent us to the elevator. We live on the 33rd floor, it is very quiet, the room is clean and tidy, the bedding is comfortable, the bathroom is separated from wet and dry, the scenery outside is really refreshing, we went to drink afternoon tea in the afternoon, although there are few things, it is acceptable. In the evening, supper was delivered, and the authentic Ningbo glutinous rice balls were eaten, which was very heartwarming. There are still options for happy hour in the evening, and the taste is good, but the food is a bit cold. This has been raised with the staff. The breakfast on the second day was great, in line with the standard of a five-star hotel, and the taste was all online. I also tried the swimming pool and it was great. We had a pleasant two-day holiday in the hotel. Every staff member we encountered was very serious and responsible, especially the lady in the black suit in the Horizon Club, who took good care of us. Thank you very much. Due to the typhoon, we spent most of the time in the hotel and felt very comfortable. Next time we come to Ningbo, we will choose Shangri-La Hotel Ningbo. I wish you all the best in your work!

In the Horizon Club Executive Lounge, you can enjoy afternoon tea while watching the sunset. Xiao Zhou from the guest service depar**ent deliberately contacted in advance before checking in to ask if there are any elderly or children living with him. When I learned that it was a child, I took the initiative to send fruit and children's products. More carefully enter the license plate for our self-driving car in advance, saving the time of scanning codes and paying fees multiple times.

msg:Ningbo Shangri-La Hotel really surprised me too much!

This time I came to Ningbo because I stayed at the Ningbo Shangri-La Hotel and left many beautiful and unforgettable memories in this city.

The hotel's river view room can directly overlook the Sanjiangkou of Ningbo, which is very shocking. And the hotel uses all the L'Occitane series, which is really too high-end.

There is also the Internet celebrity Ferris wheel 🎡afternoon tea, no matter how you shoot it, it is very good.
The executive room can go to the Horizon Club on the 28th floor. There will be all-day snacks and soft drinks, and meals will be provided at 5:30 in the evening. It can be said that it is a pleasant surprise to enjoy the beautiful scenery of the city while accompanied by delicious food.

And the location is in the center of Ningbo, with Tianyi Square downstairs, super convenient for shopping and traveling.

At night, you can also watch the bright night view of Ningbo Sanjiangkou from the room. If you also want to leave good memories in Ningbo, Ningbo Shangri-La Hotel must be your best choice.

Because there were VIPs traveling with me, I contacted the hotel before checking in. I got to know Xiao Zhou from the hotel on the phone. Firstly, we pre-arranged our arrival time to prepare the rooms, and prepared exquisite special fruit pastries for all 5 rooms, which moved us 2 VIPs who were born in Ningbo. The luxury we booked was even more surprising when we checked in. The big room with river view in the pavilion was upgraded to a suite for free. The vast and invincible night view of the suite is really beautiful, and it is convenient for us to discuss business, which is really considerate. This is a wonderful stay, thanks to Xiao Zhou for his dedicated, thoughtful and considerate service🙏, I will stay in Shangri-La next time I come to Ningbo👏👏👏

The room is big and well cleaned, but it does feel old. Fortunately, the charging cable is very neat. The bed is moderately soft and hard.

There is a wall between the twin room and the bathroom. I hate all types of glass, partitions, and curtains.

Good breakfast, especially good bread.

Here comes the bad review: There is a big construction site on the side not facing the river, and piling starts early in the morning (public holiday), so I went to bed early. At this point, many low-priced hotels will give tips, give away earplugs or something)

We stayed at the Horizon Club on the 30th floor. From the beginning of our stay, we enjoyed meticulous care. Xiao Zhou at the front desk carefully introduced a series of facilities and services, which made us feel at home. After entering the room, there are welcome fruits and Ningbo special snacks, and then go to the executive lounge on the 28th floor, where you can enjoy exquisite afternoon tea. After returning to the room after drinking afternoon tea, the waiter immediately delivered Ningbo special wine glutinous rice balls. There is a free simple buffet dinner from 5:30 to 7:30 in the evening. It is simple but actually full of beautiful things. There is also happy hour after dinner. Woke up the next day to another breakfast buffet. So since entering the hotel, I have been eating, drinking and chatting in the executive lounge on the 28th floor looking at the beautiful scenery outside the window. The key is that these are free, and it is really delicious!

The beautiful scenery of jio is not to be missed. Although the hotel is a few years old, it can occupy the city center location. Secondly, I have to say that the hotel service is very good. It may be a novice on the first day of check-in, and the check-in is a bit slow. It was originally said to be upgraded to a suite, but because I wanted to see the river view, I didn't upgrade. Later, the child accidentally scratched the skin and called the service center to ask if there was any band-aid. The waiter gave iodophor tablets and band-aid, which was more thoughtful. In addition, I must praise Manager Tan who is on duty at 5.1, because I shivered and continued to live in one room and changed to two rooms. I didn't realize it myself. The manager reminded me patiently and asked me to confirm the order, and later canceled many of them smoothly. Orders, considerate for consumers, feel at home. My son originally said that he would stay in *hao when he comes back next time, but I think I will choose Ningxiang again!

From the hotel room, you can have a panoramic view of the beautiful night view of the Sanjiang Interchange, and it is not too far from the main scenic spots in Ningbo. The hotel meets the service standards of Shangri-La, but only Guests can't open the window of the room by themselves. The room will smell of decoration materials in the afternoon. If the service staff is asked to help open it, the noise of vehicles on the road will affect the rest. You have to ask the service staff to help lock it.

Service: We arrived early at ten o'clock in the morning, and someone was checking out. The front desk was very friendly and helped us arrange two rooms on the same floor, and checked in early. The room is also very good, clean and tidy, and the attitude of the cleaning lady is also very good.

msg:I like to book a larger room. When I booked the room, the picture of the room seemed to be quite large, and it was marked as 45 square meters, but it was actually a false report!
Let me show you that the width of the bed is 2 meters, the two bedside tables add up to 1 meter, the width of the single sofa by the window is 1.5 meters, and the length of the room part does not exceed 5 meters. The bathtub, two doors, and basin in the bathroom will never exceed 4 meters in total. The above add up to the length of the entire room within 9 meters. Within 4 meters wide, because the bed is 2 meters long, there are at most two vertical beds in the width of the room. 9 meters × 4 meters = 36 square meters, this room is within 36 square meters!
I told the front desk that the room was too small, did I give the wrong room, or did the hotel still count as the shared area when I sold the house? They reported that the room was correct, denied the false report of the area, and said that they would change the layout of the same room for us and it might feel a little bigger, but the occupancy was also very small!
Very dissatisfied with this room! !
It's not bad to open the curtains at night, but the water is dirty during the day. .

Swipe the card to go upstairs, the privacy is very good, even if you travel alone, you feel very safe. There are no random people coming and going in the corridor, and the sense of security is max~
The river view is first-class, the facilities are a bit old, but they are in good use. The bed and pillows are moderately soft and hard. There are bathtubs and showers. The hotel provides bath salts, which is very good. In terms of the layout of the house, it is a pity that the sofa faces the river view. You can lean on the back of the sofa and enjoy the river view hahaha

msg:I booked the package with afternoon tea and Ferris wheel on Ctrip, and checked in at the hotel at 14:30 in the afternoon, but the front desk said that the room was not ready and we had to wait, so go and eat the afternoon tea first. When I went to the lobby and asked for afternoon tea, the waiter said that I had to make an appoin**ent in advance, otherwise I would have to wait for half an hour. In fact, Ctrip's introduction says that no advance reservation is required. As a result, I waited for nearly an hour and urged several times, but the waiter insisted that an appoin**ent is usually required. Really speechless, what is written on Ctrip? The last afternoon tea was not good either.
After waiting for an hour and a half, the front desk did not inform the room that the room was ready, so I had to go and ask myself to check and confirm. If you don't ask, you will have to wait until night.
After finally staying, I found that the facilities of this hotel are relatively old. The hair dryer is an old-fashioned Feike, the TV is relatively small, and there is no fan heater in the bathroom. I feel that it is not worthy of a five-star hotel and the price. The most outrageous thing is that the mobile phone charger in the room can only be used by scanning the code and paying a deposit.
No one responded to the comments written to the hotel on the room feedback paper.
I will not stay at this hotel next time I come to Ningbo.

Lily, the little beauty at the front desk, can also respond to us immediately when we have questions!

Staying in Shangri-La not only saw the standard management of the hotel, but also saw the high professionalism of the staff. At the same time, I also felt their love for Ningbo. They always spared no effort to introduce Ningbo to us. They hope that every guest can be Take a good look at Ningbo and understand Ningbo!

msg:Traveled to Ningbo during the Spring Festival and stayed at the Shangri-La Hotel. Ningbo is a city where the Fenghua River, Yuyao River and Yongjiang River converge. The hotel is just near the gathering point and has an excellent location.
        It costs more than 100 yuan to upgrade from the city view room to the river view room. The view is wide. Looking out of the window, the Sanjiang River is in front of you. At night, the neon lights are flashing, and the buildings by the river are linked to the light show. Sitting in the room and enjoying it, it is definitely worth the fare.
        During the Spring Festival, people follow the crowd...
        Check-in queue, fortunately not long, like a quarter of an hour.
        There was a queue for breakfast, and it took about half an hour to enter the restaurant. However, the waiters were very strong, there were many varieties, and the supply of food was endless, especially the western dim sum. As long as you sit in and eat, you can always resolve the troubles of queuing before. Everyone has worked hard.
       Parking is free. Before leaving, you need to scan a QR code at the front desk and register the information.
       The room is large and wide, with the consistent furniture style of Shangri-La Hotel.
       The toilet is separated from wet and dry, with both shower and bathtub.
       Although the hotel is a bit old, it is comfortable and safe to live in.
       The bathrobes are uniformly placed in the bag and sealed, which is safer and more hygienic. But children's slippers are not in stock, and they are gone when they want them.
        In terms of service, there is no delay due to the large number of guests. Whether it is the lobby, parking lot or breakfast restaurant, there are a few staff who look like senior employees, calmly and steadily solving difficult problems, which is also the foundation of a hotel.

In the process of dealing with the episode, the professionalism of the two people who dealt with it is worthy of praise. They are neither humble nor overbearing, dignified and gentle.

We drank a cup of coffee at 98, but the scenery was pretty good and the room was clean. Overall it's okay. After all, the hotel has been in the hotel for many years and cannot be so demanding.

In fact, the aroma of my favorite lobby in Shangri-La is the symbol of Shangri-La, and it is also a memory point for it.
This hotel has a rich breakfast. It is more cost-effective to buy a breakfast-included package. For breakfast, please cook a wonton and serve it with snow cabbage. The cabbage is so delicious, a tablespoon every day!
The buffet for dinner is purchased separately, but there are many varieties and fresh seafood.
After staying for a few days, the bedding was a bit damp. What bothered me the most was the noise. A construction site next to the hotel actually started 24 hours a day (I don’t know why the local authority didn’t supervise it). Fall asleep, please choose carefully!

Secondly, the transportation is not very convenient. The subway is five or six hundred meters. The nucleic acid point is on Tianyi, one kilometer. In this season, walking is too far, and taking a taxi is too close. In the end, Jiangjingfang must choose the end of the small number, because it is facing Sanjiangkou, otherwise it is facing Westin.

1) When applying for extended stay, the front desk staff or interns have poor service awareness. The hotel cannot allow such employees to be at the front desk, which will greatly reduce the customer experience.

Although the hotel opened relatively early, it is still very good in all aspects. There was no room available when we checked into the hotel, and we were checked in as soon as possible after waiting on the lounge floor. The room is clean and comfortable, the breakfast is ok, the children swim in the gym for adults, everyone is satisfied. The beauty service at the front desk is also praised~

The parent-child room that I booked was told at noon that it was being cleaned. After one hour, we waited on the executive floor. After one hour, we were told that it had not been cleaned. The hotel restaurant was full, so I went out for lunch under the sun. At two o'clock in the afternoon, there was still no room. I couldn't tell the lie later, I told the front that I didn't check out, so I opened a room to rest first. It was not until 7:30 p.m. that I was late to inform that I could stay in another themed parent-child room. So far, speechless. In addition, the car is charging in the ba*****t, and I don't want to go back to the room. I sit on the first floor and wait for a while, and immediately come over to make consumption, and tell me that it is a guest upstairs. This is the service of Shangri-La, which occupies an excellent location in Sanjiangkou. Terrible experience.

I originally wanted to stay at the Westin, but I thought Shangri-La was relatively quieter… Arrived at the hotel around 10:30 in the morning and got the room smoothly. Although it is not a river view room, it is still quite good. The surrounding is relatively quiet, and it feels more comfortable than hotels along the street. Room service is also very good, will come again next time.

Regardless of whether it is breakfast, afternoon tea or happy hour dinner, Shangri-La Horizon Club, Ningbo, has left a deep impression on me. In particular, we were touched by the care and inquiries from the waiters to the old lady. Special thanks to Weng Yujing, Yang Siyu and Wen Sien. The view of the 28-story Horizon Pavilion is very good. The price/performance ratio is higher than that of ordinary rooms. It is also very close to the old Bund. The angle of seeing the intersection of three rivers is great, and you can take a panoramic view. This time I happened to stay in time for my birthday. The hotel also gave me a cake. If it weren't for the hotel to remind me, I would have forgotten it. Shangri-La's service is really absent.

As a result, because of the mistakes made by the staff on the executive floor of the hotel in arranging the breakfast table (no distinction between the front and back) and the inaction after a conflict, a couple of extremely low quality spoke extremely vulgar language on the executive floor of the hotel Insult, shoving.
Although the hotel front office manager strongly apologized afterwards and hoped to provide more including sightseeing tours and hotel meals (none of which was accepted by me). But this experience made me too angry, and it ruined the mood of the whole trip.
I returned to the room and hoped to add a few bottles of mineral water. After ten minutes after two phone calls, the staff brought the bottled water that was too lazy to remove the packaging.
I am really wondering, could it be that this is what happened to Shangri-La in an epidemic?

The toiletry used is also this kind of unbranded, and it can’t be compared with Shangri-La in other places. Compared with that, my boyfriend called the room service and said that he wanted the charging cable and he didn’t ask him to scan the power bank. I called another one, which might be strongly requested, and sent a broken one. I charged 40% of the battery all night. Check in at 1 o’clock and open at 8 o’clock in the morning. Just nine hours of staying and vomiting, it’s much worse than Westin. I don’t understand why the score is 0.4 points higher. Where did it come from? I didn’t open the curtains late in the morning and opened it in the morning. I vomited the scenery. I just finished ordering and found that there was no breakfast. I wanted to cancel but I was told that I couldn’t cancel. I came to get up early to take pictures. I asked if the breakfast voucher can be delivered in the lobby. I couldn’t deliver breakfast because of the epidemic. I can only leave nearby in the morning. I looked for a breakfast shop everywhere for a few hours, but I was strictly rejected. Alas, there is no humanized experience. It is really unpleasant. I suggest you stay cautiously. I personally feel that Westin is much better. Choose carefully

msg:This time I took my grandson to live on the 30th floor of Shangri-La Hotel, Ningbo. I watched the scenery of Sanjiangkou every night and swim every afternoon. The family was very happy. Especially Ms. Cui Leilei, the manager of the 28th floor Horizon Club, is professional, active and enthusiastic, and makes people feel at home. Our family likes her very much. Give her a thumbs up!

msg:I often choose Shangri-La Hotel when traveling. This time I stayed at the Shangri-La Hotel in Ningbo and brought me new surprises. The location of the hotel is particularly good, just beside the Sanjiangkou, a landmark location in Ningbo. When checking in the hotel lobby, Mr. Wenhao She at the front desk was very enthusiastic and asked carefully about the guests’ check-in needs and preferences. Baton. During the stay at the hotel, it was the celebration of the centennial of the founding of the party. At night, I enjoyed the beautiful light show and drone performances at Sanjiangkou, and I felt the spirit of Ningbo people and the spirit of high spirits. The breakfast service of the hotel is also worthy of praise. More than once, the staff took the initiative to ask the guests what their needs were and tried every means to solve them, which made people feel the different service quality. This stay was a great experience and I look forward to staying at Shangri-La again.

But the breakfast is a bit sloppy, unlike a five-star hotel. I bought the package of hotel + cruise. It was a pity that I couldn't take a cruise because of heavy rain.

msg:I go to Ningbo once or twice a year with my family. Since the outbreak last year, I haven’t been to Ningbo for nearly a year and a half. This time I went to Ningbo for three days and stayed at the Shangri-La Hotel. I want to go downstairs for a walk.
The scenery is good, but the breakfast is disappointing... Picture 3 is the egg roll on Sunday morning, and picture 4 is the egg roll on Monday. Not to mention that the plate is not in place, so let's talk about the egg roll. There is no ingredient in it. . The bacon on Sunday was very soft and filled in time. The bacon on Monday was as hard as chewing a rock, and it took several times to replenish it. There is no five-star standard for breakfast. The executive chef needs to think and review. Since the hotel has informed the guests that they can dine in the Horizon Pavilion on the 28th floor, the starting point is good, allowing guests to enjoy the river view while having breakfast, but the hardware and software cannot keep up, and the points are severely reduced.

給的房間就在豪華閣同一樓層，，房門口歪歪扭扭扔了一張1米*1.5米的地毯，大概是為了遮擋下面的污漬，昏暗的燈光下，走近的時候就像走進了某地下車庫，感覺實在不好
第一晚送了酒釀小圓子，雖然味道不出彩，但總算是這次住宿唯一的亮點了

msg:朋友推薦，衝著香格里拉的牌子去的，卻成了此次出遊的唯一敗筆。
預訂房間時，註明了房間需要“安靜”。晚餐回房，一開始電視機開着，沒有太大感覺。深夜準備睡覺了，始終聽到間隔幾分鐘就一次轟鳴聲，每次持續起碼20秒。尋了半個多小時，找不到原因。隨電話問服務人員，説派人來看，等了10分鐘，沒人；又打了一次電話，又沒人；再打！前後間隔起碼半個小時，來了個服務人員。開門就説，是解釋説是電梯聲。我們恍然，一切都解釋得通了。以為是地鐵，以為旁邊是機場，以為是下面汽車。。。原來是一牆之隔的電梯！
但是，唯一解釋不通的是，這樣的房間，怎麼可以提供給客人使用？？
五星賓館的行政客房，難道是這樣的標準麼？
給的建議：給你們一副耳塞！你覺得我們能同意麼？那麼客房都滿了，給你們調到旁邊的公寓吧。其他沒有選擇了！折騰到半夜，老公發燒了！
作為客人，半夜1點，我們確實也沒有選擇了。
所有的服務人員，似乎是司空見慣了這樣的遭遇，一臉事不關己。
這次經歷，是我們所有入住賓館中最差的體驗。
我們唯一的選擇是，讓更多的人知道這樣的事實，儘可能遭遇我們同樣的痛苦。今後我們也不會再選擇這樣的酒店，包括香格里拉這個品牌。

林緣知道我入住當天恰好是生日後，多贈送了一份晚上的歡樂時光給我女兒，並在我們全家晩上就餐時送上為我提前訂好的生日蛋糕，味道可口。
楊潔靜經理面對五一高峯期的排房和儘早入住訴求，熱情、耐心、專業、果斷，讓我對香格里拉集團的管理素質留下了美好的印象。
如果要給酒店提一點建議的話，一是2樓自助早餐的品種，連續兩天基本無變化。二是客房提供的牙刷不夠軟，刷起來有點硬。

但是要吐槽一下酒店前台，行動太慢了，所有人看起來都是懶洋洋的，面無表情，是很令人意外的。
讓我印象深刻的是禮賓部的一個大哥，服務態度和表現，都配得上金鑰匙👌🏻酒店的一樓服務團隊參差不齊，好的太好，差的太差，希望整個大堂都惡補一下服務管理。

這次攜程沒有定到想要的房型，抱着試試的態度聯繫了小周，第一時間就幫我協調好，縮短我辦理入住時間。到店前，入住中，離店後小周都適時的詢問入住感受及需求，還貼心的每天都送水果。
細節之處都是温暖，畢竟出門在外還是要住的舒服，下次再來還會選擇香格里拉。

待改進：豪華酒店房間該給住客配備的東西，應該主動配齊，不能等客人要；冰箱裏的飲料還要收費，豪華酒店不應該，一瓶巴黎水收費20多元不厚道。
本來不應該給五星好評，但是沖自助餐廳的盒盒（微信名）費心給安排了除夕晚餐，還有管家小周的熱情服務，還是把這個五星給他們的周到服務，而不是酒店和酒店的管理層。

而且前台的小周的服務很不錯。
我是外國人不太熟悉，他加我的微信，幫助了很多。他知道這是我們20週年結婚紀念日，蛋糕也送到我的房間。也我每次在微信問的時候很快就回復幫助。他給我們留下了寧波的好印象。下次再來，肯定會在香格里拉酒店住。謝謝

二、酒店客房兩側房間，一側是江景房，另一層是工地房，從早上七點多開始施工，震的樓板都在顫，根本睡不了懶覺。
總之，這是我住過的最差的香格里拉。也不知道業主方是不是不想好好乾，準備賣了吧？

還是有些不足之處，主要早餐水準夠不上五星，西冷餐薩拉米、鴨胸等都很難入口，中冷熱餐就是大食堂家常菜。衹吃點寧波小吃味道倒還是不錯的，一連吃幾天就比較膩。另外入住次日一早8:30服務員敲門要來打掃房間，不知道是什麼意思，不應該出現這種操作。

退房時，前台服務員愛搭不理，倒是邊上的服務員看我們排隊很久主動提出有需要幫助否，讓我們得以快速退房。

進入客房，很温馨，超滿意，桌上有備好的保温杯銀耳湯，果盤，乾果，點心。過了一陣子，服務生又送來豐盛的另一果盤。
由於是第一次入住，小周還特意免費提供二樓自助早餐。
準備離開酒店時，早早地安排了到客房提行李，小周還熱情地把我們送到酒店大門口。
這是一次完美的入住體驗，感謝小周的熱情周到專業的五星級服務！
下次一定還會入住！

房間：登記的前台應該是個新人 登機時和旁邊的人悄悄地表示沒有權限 辦理的時間有點長 並且沒有告知我們早餐的情況 還需要多練練 走廊上鋪着軟軟的地毯 減少了很多噪音 房間相對比較安靜 隔壁的關門聲還是能聽到的 但是也不算打擾 隔音還是可以的 房間的設施比較新 衹是一整個房間 衹有衞生間有抽紙 有點小不方便 冰箱裏沒有飲料 桌子上衹有水 茶包和咖啡 另外歡迎水果和小點心是我們晚上從景點回來之後再擺房間的 略微顯得準備不足
餐食：早餐很豐富 一開始吃的很開心 衹是我們吃到9點50左右的時候就開始收攤了

msg:一次糟糕的入住體驗
1⃣️從地下車庫開始，一下地庫就給我第一個困惑：酒店的大堂指示在哪裡，B1層未發現，那就走B2層，還好看到的酒店大堂。所有給客户帶來困惑的服務都是不夠用心的。
2⃣️入住後房間中拖鞋僅一雙、無紙巾，春節忙，我選擇理解；
3⃣️三江夜遊船票（價值236），我一直打不通無法預約，聯繫酒店，回覆我：我們也沒辦法，讓我再打打預約電話。住客知道怎麼處理好用聯繫酒店幹嘛，根本沒有解決顧客的困難，反而覺得不負責任。解決方案：攜程推我100元，票自己保留可以贈予其他親朋好友，大過年的，我選擇和和氣氣，理解他們工作不容易。
4⃣️酒店入住，未提醒客户登記車牌號，等我扣完費，諮詢酒店客服，告訴我未告知前台有車輛，這個扣費沒辦法了。作為高檔酒店，服務並沒有高檔，什麼都需要顧客提醒，那酒店替顧客考慮了什麼，這是一個很大的問號？
6⃣️酒店套餐包含的另一項摩天輪，到我離店都沒有人提醒我未使用；
7⃣️預訂的酒店套餐含下午茶，但是依舊扣了費；酒店都不用動腦子嗎？入住押了3000元的按金就可以隨便扣？不用在扣費前先跟我確認一下嗎？我不去查，就這樣過啦？

我提醒他們確認費用明細、儘快回覆，一直無音信，不用負責了、不用上心服務了……

房間的話設施配套還挺好，唯一就是空調晚上聲音我個人覺得很響，家人覺得沒什麼問題。
早飯很豐盛，總體很不錯，可能起來比較早 沒有排隊，節日這兩天一般8點後就要排隊了。
