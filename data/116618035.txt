msg:The hotel is extremely poor in all aspects, and it is not at all the standard of a five-star hotel. The service attitude is poor, and it can be said that there is no concept of service at all. I arrived at the hotel at 3 pm, checked in to the room, and was told that the room had not been cleaned yet. The front desk refused to change the room, which was very strange. There was a strong smell of formaldehyde in the room, and I seriously suspected that the formaldehyde exceeded the standard, and the sound insulation effect was poor. The dishes for breakfast, lunch, dinner and supper were exactly the same. The hotel cleaning staff shouted and chatted loudly to each other in the corridor for a long time every day, which seriously affected the rest of the customers. The next day, I asked to clean the room repeatedly and communicated by phone many times without success, and the phone was hung up inexplicably in the middle. The management of the lobby manager is even more messed up, leaving customers with nowhere to complain, and a bad attitude. The supplies in the room are incomplete, and there is a shortage of drinking water, tea bags, drinks and food. There is no worst hotel.

msg:I booked a homestay before, but found that there were no rooms when I arrived. Ctrip paid the difference and moved me to the nearest hotel. The room was great, but the only thing that was annoying was that the navigation map was wrong. I spent at least half an hour looking for it. I suspect it was a prank, and someone registered a similar name to the hotel at another address on Baidu Maps (an alley in a village). If you want to navigate there, I suggest you don't use Baidu Maps, or if you do, navigate to the building materials city shown in the picture. The road opposite the building materials city is the hotel. The breakfast buffet restaurant is very lively, and there are snacks from Tingzhou. The food that looks like Guangdong rice noodle rolls is great!

The hotel is new, the room is large, the toiletries are high-end, breakfast, lunch, dinner and supper are all included, and the food is quite rich. I highly recommend it. I seldom write reviews, but I really like it and must give it a good review. Both the elderly and children say it's good. The children said that the hotel impressed them the most on this trip because it's good.

However, the room arranged by the front desk for my parents is along the street. The elderly have a shallow sleep and did not sleep well. I hope that the front desk will arrange rooms according to the actual situation of the guests in the future. During the period, the hotel front desk price was lower than that of Ctrip. Ctrip also confirmed with the hotel very quickly and refunded the price difference. I feel that Ctrip's after-sales service is getting better and better.

The hotel is very new and clean; the overall layout of the room is very fashionable, and the bathroom uses cloth-patterned glass, which shows that the overall decoration is still very cost-effective; automatic curtains, automatic toilets, and induction lights increase the experience, two words "comfortable"; the hotel not only provides breakfast but also midnight snacks, which are worth mentioning. I tried it out of curiosity, and the variety is quite rich, and it is definitely not perfunctory to attract attention, very good 👍

When they saw the luggage, they walked into the room. I sat up and asked what they were doing. When I didn't ask for any service, the waiter still didn't explain and just said they were checking the water pipes. When we refused repeatedly, they left without any apology. The experience was very bad. The feedback time for the complaint was more than three hours.

msg:The overall management of the new hotel is not in place yet. We stayed in two rooms. One of them had tea stains on the tea set and the waiter wiped it with a face towel, leaving the stain and threw it on the countertop and left. In the other bathroom, there was hair residue in the bathroom and it caused the drainage to be blocked. The small bottle of liquid was half used up. When we gave feedback with good intentions, it felt perfunctory. During the meal time, it was said that the director brought people to replace the decorations above the open dishes, which further showed that the management problems of this hotel are all-round and systematic. I had planned to extend my stay when I checked in, but ended up leaving early.

msg:The service is good, and they are all experienced service staff. The food must be praised, the taste is authentic, and the authentic Hakka flavor is done in one stop. However, if it is a five-star hotel, some details still need to be improved as soon as possible. The sound insulation of the room is not ideal. If someone passes by in the corridor outside at night, the sound is quite loud. Then as a tourist attraction hotel, the living and entertainment facilities for children are relatively lacking. Then it is a pity that there is no swimming pool in the hotel.

The buffet provided by the hotel is a bit low for such a hotel, and it is almost like eating fast food. The service of the front desk lady is okay, but the service of the floor cleaning aunt is not very good, and the tone of her speech is a bit aggressive.
