The hotel rooms and restaurant are great, breakfast is good. 

Swimming pool is smaller than typical resort in HaiTang Bay, but it's enough.  The gym was not as nice and at the basement with only basic equipment.

msg:After booking, the housekeeper will contact me two days in advance. Although there are some minor episodes, fortunately, I did not give up when I checked in. Finally, I added WeChat with the housekeeper Xiao Xu. I felt very destined. We have the same surname and are my housekeeper. Xiao Xu is very considerate and patient. He will help solve any problems in time and recommend places to play and eat in the surrounding area.

The hotel is very close to Wuzhizhou Island, so I booked a day specifically to facilitate going to Wuzhizhou Island. The transportation is very convenient and has a sense of design. Every staff member I met from the concierge depar**ent to the front office depar**ent to the housekeeping depar**ent to the breakfast restaurant of the hotel is very polite and will take the initiative to say hello.

The disadvantage is that because it is a new hotel, the room uses more wooden decoration, so there is still some decoration smell. Secondly, I don’t know why it is a little more humid than the hotel I stayed in by the sea. There are many white woodworms in the cabinet drawers at the entrance. It was late at night, so I didn’t want the guest room to help change a new bed sheet and quilt. It is recommended that the hotel prepare some disinfectants (to deal with woodworms). If you feel damp when you check in, you can tell the housekeeper or the guest room. Finally, there were some minor problems with breakfast, such as the sweet potatoes were not steamed thoroughly, which was reported to the restaurant staff at the time. There is also a construction site around the hotel that has been built almost completely. There was no construction when I went there, which did not affect the stay experience. However, the music in the hotel's sea salt bar is relatively loud. Although the building is far away, I can still hear it. Fortunately, it will end before 22:00, which does not affect sleep.

I didn't see the hotel's public beach this time, and I didn't see any instructions, but the hotel has a swimming pool, an area for children to play, and a self-service laundry room. The overall style is more suitable for young people. I have the opportunity to experience it again! I stayed in 7 hotels this time. I will stay a few more days alone next time if I have time! !

msg:Both the book and the music website like to regard "Taikang Home Boutique Hotel" as a substitute for the Edition. I personally prefer to define this hotel as a unique and hidden treasure hotel among the many popular check-in hotels. It deserves to be remembered by everyone. 🌱🌱🌱

When I was screening resort hotels, I almost missed this hotel because of its simple name. To be honest, as soon as I arrived at the hotel, I was attracted by the design of this hotel, with a scene every ten steps and a sense of lens that is not picky about angles. I took a lot of photos and I couldn't bear to delete them in my mobile phone. It can be seen that every detail was carefully considered when designing the hotel. 💫🌻

Service: When it comes to the hotel's service, it is remarkable.
Before checking in, the butler contacted me personally to understand my personal preferences and travel methods and arranged the room in advance. In fact, it is similar to the butler service of most hotels. But there is one thing that my housekeeper "Xiao Xu" did that made me respect and considerate, which is also different from other hotel housekeepers. We didn't meet during the whole process, but she paid meticulous attention to me during my stay. If I had any questions or requests, she would do her best to help me and solve the problem for me. For me, a person who is socially anxious and refuses to socialize politely, it's really too friendly. 😚😚😘

The afternoon tea buffet experience included in the package couldn't be more perfect. It is a blessing for lazy people who don't eat lunch at noon and have some desserts in the afternoon to store energy after breakfast. Miss Shine received us and took care of us like a friend to take a seat and arrange tea. Because my coat was stained with cake, she helped me get a wet towel to wipe it without hesitation. This is the highest configuration of the hotel's considerate service. 👍👍💫

Speaking of the travel photography experience service, this time I chose the "Travel Photography with a Companion" service. To be honest, I never consider the free travel photography service when I stay in a hotel. After all, I personally will be scared of stereotypes and afraid of stepping into traps. I believe this is the psychological state of most people. 😅😅
The fact is that it is simply too convenient. For those who are companions with bad teammates and have poor photography skills, it is simply a blessing. The feeling and artistic conception I want can be arranged in place as long as I simply convey it to the "photographer of the travel photography company", and I am very satisfied with the photos.
At the same time, the surprise is that the photographer will tell you how to pose, and there is no need to worry about the lens feeling and angle after the photos are out. Later, I chose to pay for the refined photos, 20 yuan per photo. Because I asked for more, the lady also allowed me to cut a little, which really satisfied my "little wool" mentality. There were some minor episodes during the period, but I really thought too much later. The "person in charge of the travel photography company, Qiu Qiu", patiently answered and solved my problems for me. The professional and graceful service experience made me feel that the extra money was worth it. Next time at a resort hotel, I will still choose the travel photography company service. 👍👍

Furthermore, I still want to talk about the hotel management. During my stay, I saw a man with glasses and healthy dark skin (he sounded like a Singaporean). He was busy everywhere, guiding guests to their seats. It was hard for me to imagine the cold stereotype left by the previous hotel senior management. It was also a trait of i people. I never had the opportunity to meet him in person. What I could observe was that he always guided the employees around him to operate and serve, and really landed on the front line. Indeed, there were always plates and paper towels on my table for a long time, which were all reminded by him. 😅😅.
This is also the comfort that I have always admired and liked. When senior management is busy and free, they should go out of the office. It is more important than ineffective and lengthy meetings. Let the guests feel that I can still have the service and respect of senior leaders. This kind of service is also what I see that is different from other hotel brands. There is no status high or low*, only sincerity and reality. 🌹🌹

Finally, whether it is the unique hotel design, the comfortable hotel staff service, or the perfect travel photography service experience, these three days and two nights are all unforgettable vacations for me. Next time, if I have the opportunity, I will still choose to stay at Taikang Home Boutique Hotel. You deserve more applause and favors. 👍👍👍🌸

For brothers and sisters who want to have travel photography services and check-in later, don’t hesitate, just go for it, there is no pitfall and discrimination, the "travel photography with companion" service is completely comparable to the five-star experience and deserves to be seen. 🌸🌸👍😘

msg:Facilities: This time, one adult and one child stayed for three days. The parent-child facilities were sufficient. 🛝Three children's swimming pools and several slides were not boring for children to play for a few days (the lifeguards were very responsible. When there were many children, I saw staff wearing shirts joining in to direct the children's slide order, which was a plus). There were children's projects every day (book one day in advance), which was rich. 🎠The indoor and outdoor children's playgrounds were great, and the aesthetics were also good (that is, as long as the weather was good and the baby could go into the water, the water projects were definitely the main focus🤓)🛏️The room was also beautiful. I especially liked the bathroom, which was very healing. Although it was not as grand as some hotels, it was not stereotyped. Each twin bed was 1.5m👍🏻The TV could project the screen👍🏻The Bluetooth speaker had wireless charging👍🏻The takeaway cabinet was just behind the B building, and it was super close to go downstairs! It was much better than some people who had to walk up and down the slope outside the lobby! 

Hygiene: What I saw was good, but there were some obvious water stains on the bathroom countertop and floor, but they were cleaned in time. The water in the swimming pool looks good, and the aunt mops the white floor in the lobby every day.

Environment: The hotel does not have its own beach. The beach is a wild beach outside the hotel that takes more than ten minutes to walk through a small forest. It is not recommended to go there ❌ It is very dirty. It doesn't matter whether the children play or not. The garden in the hotel is small and beautiful. Although there is no large area of ​​green such as lawn, it can be seen that enough thought has been put into designing small scenes. The combination of logs 🪵, waterscape 💦, and green plants 🪴 is pleasing to the eye, and the simple style is really good. There is a hollow valley garden next to the B building, with a suspension bridge and a plank road. After breakfast, you can go for a walk and see the digestion. The overall holiday a**osphere is indeed a bit worse than that of a big hotel (the a**osphere still depends on the sea view), but it is really enough to take children (I only stayed in the children's pool for three days, and it doesn't matter what other places are like 😂)

Service: The service is still good. The front desk lady upgraded the sea view room (although it doesn't matter whether there is a sea view or not, you can just see a little bit) She remembered my name and room number, and was very attentive. The hotel's hardware is not as good as other hotels, but the activities are very attentive. Every night, the nightfall ceremony will light up the lights, sing, dance, and play with fire. It is full of sincerity and not perfunctory. My child loves to watch it and goes there every day. He is particularly adoring.

Overall, it is definitely a very cost-effective hotel in Haitang Bay. High cost-effectiveness is an advantage! After all, you get what you pay for, and you have to compare products at the same price. I definitely stayed there because it is cheap during holidays, and it is even more amazing if there are activities on weekdays. What else do you want? ! ! The only shortcoming is that the children's swimming pool is not heated, and you have to go back when the sun sets. Also, the room suddenly tripped on the morning of the second day of check-in, and then recovered, which confused me. I got up and turned it off and continued to sleep. Finally, I suggest that the hotel really consider changing its name~

Any request was met immediately and the response was also timely at night. The nightfall ceremony at night was very good, with performances and lighting. The hotel breakfast was very rich and the children's facilities were very good. The only disadvantage is that it is a little far from the beach, but it doesn't affect it. It's so hot that I just want to stay in the hotel and drive out for a walk in the evening. Everything else is great.

msg:This year, I stayed in four hotels during the May Day holiday: Westin, Sunshine No. 1, Edition and here.
The following points are the best or one of the best in Taikang Home:
1~ Hotel design: The hotel is not big, but the design is very strong and it is very film-like, comparable to Edition.
2~ The room is not very big, but the style we like, and the storage space is the best among the four hotels.
3~ The best swimming pool among the four hotels, the children's pool has good facilities, taking into account both big and small children. Adult (also suitable for children) swimming pool! The cleanest, the booth design is the most comfortable. With music, the swimming pool has the strongest holiday feeling.
4~ The hotel has rich activities and high quality.
5~ The hotel service is friendly, and the overall quality of the hotel staff is the best in Edition, but also the most standardized. But the employees we met here are very friendly, especially the hotel executives.
6~ Lunch and dinner in the Chinese restaurant are extremely cost-effective in the hotel in Haitang Bay.
In addition, I would like to complain about Sunshine No. 1, which is often compared (not very recommended): the family swimming pool is closed, the internet-famous transparent swimming pool is not clean (there are many dead insects at the bottom of the pool), there are many mosquitoes (the only hotel where I was bitten), and the staff training is not in place (not all employees, but probably all the weird services we encountered, from the front desk to the restaurant, from the restaurant to the sky bar...).

msg:Taikang Home is really a treasure hotel with a great experience. The hotel as a whole has a sense of design, elegance and high-end. The original wood style of the room is also a tone I like very much. No matter where you take photos, it is super photogenic. What is even more unexpected is that the food and beverage are also delicious. Even my very picky Guangdong stomach is very satisfied. The hotel service staff are very enthusiastic. They will take the initiative to help you take your luggage to the room, and will take the initiative to help you open the door when getting on and off the car. Even the cleaning aunt will greet you enthusiastically, which makes you feel very warm in your heart. The nightfall ceremony at night is also a surprise, with wishing lanterns and fire dance performances... The fire dancer with braids is so handsome😍 It is especially worth mentioning that my housekeeper Xiao Xu has arranged everything very thoughtfully. If you need anything, just find her. She also shared with us the attractions and food near the hotel. She is a very careful and warm girl, which made us feel particularly at ease on this trip. We originally planned to stay for two days, and then stayed for another day. If I didn’t have to go back to move bricks, I guess I could stay for many days... In short, I strongly recommend Taikang Home😄

msg:I am very satisfied with this stay. The hotel's luxury studio suite pre-sale package is very suitable. Before booking the hotel, I repeatedly studied and compared many hotels of the same type, and finally chose this one. Service: The hotel's service is very good. Ruonan at the front desk is very considerate and professional, and she also upgraded the room type for us for free. The orientation of the room is the issue I am most concerned about when booking. I saw comments before that some will face the construction site, so I called many times to confirm, and also contacted the hotel staff Liu Peng through Ctrip to ask him to help me note the orientation of the room. In the end, the view is perfect. The front desk chose a room facing the pool and the sea for us. Not only is the view good, but the room area has also been upgraded to a larger boutique studio suite. The front desk told me that unless the room is full, guests will not be arranged to the room on the construction site side under normal circumstances. If you are not assured, you can also make a note or contact the front desk by phone after booking. In fact, the construction site side is not bad for the hotel because the project next to it is unfinished, and the hotel is also a victim😂. When you walk in the hotel, all the staff including the cleaning staff will greet you warmly. When you eat breakfast, there will be a leader standing at the door to greet the guests and arrange for the waiter to guide you. Thank you very much to the cleaning staff in charge of room A333. Not only did they fold the clothes on the bed for us, but they also kept the hygiene very clean. When they saw that we drank more tea and water, they left us eight bottles of drinking water the next day. The hotel not only provided free water and hangers, but also provided free tea sets and bathtub sets. Such service really makes people feel comfortable. ￼
Breakfast: Breakfast is a highlight. In hotels of the same price, the types of breakfast are very rich, and there will be local snacks. During our stay, we caught up with March 3 and could taste Hainan's special rice wine. The most important thing is that not only are the types rich, but each one is delicious. The stewed bean curd is very authentic, and the egg stall also provides unlimited Benedict eggs, which is very labor-intensive. There are also many types of desserts, each of which is exquisite. ￼
Entertainment: There are many entertainment activities. It is a qualified resort hotel. ￼There is a nightfall ceremony every night, where you can experience cocktails, boats, live performances and fire dance performances. The hotel's TV supports screen projection, and the public area has a large indoor amusement park and an outdoor amusement park, an adult swimming pool, a water park with a water slide, and a park. You can also rent paddle boards and glass boats in the swimming pool. In short, you won't be bored staying in the hotel every day.
Beach: The hotel does not have its own beach. You need to cross a road through the forest to reach the public beach. This road is actually very close, but the hotel does not have its own wooden boardwalk. When we went there, it was under construction, so we could only temporarily cross the forest. It felt like an adventure. Haitang Bay itself is not suitable for swimming. You can only take a walk on the beach. There are fewer people and it is more primitive.
Spa: There is a spa experience in the package, which feels very good. It is a Thai technician. The process is very professional, and he will not recommend you to do any other projects at all. He will not bother you again after the end.
Afternoon tea: There are a lot of things in the self-service afternoon tea, and there are salty snacks. You can eat smoked salmon and Iberian ham, which is still worth it.
Facilities: The hotel's facilities are very new, the decoration style is very natural, very comfortable and durable. The public area is very grand. The ceiling is very high, and there are no doors between the buildings, giving a feeling of being deep in nature. There is a basement for self-driving vehicles. The most commendable thing is that the hotel has a self-service laundry room without charging any fees. It is very convenient to wash clothes. There is a half-hour mode. You only need to throw the clothes in before breakfast and take them out after breakfast. The washing machine has been automatically set, so you don't have to worry about the laundry detergent.

In general, I am very satisfied with this trip and will choose here next time.

Hotel Environment: Stepping into Sanya Taikang Home Resort Hotel·Zhenpin Selection, it feels like being in a quiet and elegant holiday paradise. The hotel is located in Haitang Bay, with a superior geographical location, surrounded by charming mountain and sea scenery and beautiful garden landscapes. From the lobby to the guest room, every place shows high quality and comfort.

Room Experience: I stayed in a sea view room, which was spacious and bright with complete facilities. Especially the 1.8-meter big bed, which gave me a sweet dream every night. The viewing balcony in the room allows me to enjoy the beautiful sea view every morning, and my mood is particularly comfortable.

Breakfast Service: The hotel has a rich variety of breakfasts, including Chinese and Western cuisines. Although the flow of people during breakfast is large, the waiters are always warm and thoughtful to ensure that every guest can enjoy satisfactory service.

Service Quality: From check-in to check-out, the hotel's service makes me very satisfied. The front desk lady is very enthusiastic and greets every time she meets. The room service staff is also very careful and will clean the room carefully every day to ensure hygiene and cleanliness.

Facilities: The hotel has complete facilities, including a constant temperature swimming pool, a gym, a children's playground, etc. Especially the constant temperature swimming pool, I can enjoy the cool swimming water even in the hot summer. The children's playground is a paradise for children, allowing them to play here to their heart's content.

Cost-effectiveness: Although the hotel is positioned at the high end, the price is very reasonable. Especially in the off-season, you can enjoy such a high-quality accommodation experience for a few hundred yuan, which is really worth the money.

Summary: Sanya Taikang Home Resort Hotel·Zhenpinzhixuan is a high-quality and cost-effective resort hotel. Whether it is the environment, service or facilities, I am very satisfied. If you plan to come to Sanya for vacation, this is definitely a good choice.

Finally, special thanks to the housekeeper Xiao Xu, who not only sent fruits but also upgraded the room type! This is the second time I have stayed here, and I will stay in Taikang next time! !

Before I came, I was very worried that the hotel would be disappointing, but after I came, I found that the environment and service were very good. If you don’t insist on a private beach, this is really a very good choice.
The hotel’s nightfall ceremony is wonderful, and the breakfast is also good.
Special praise for the housekeeper Ruby, a very enthusiastic girl. I added WeChat before checking in and helped upgrade the sea view suite. The whole process was responsive and responded very promptly. Every time I stay in a hotel, I am very worried that the room is not good. Thank you Ruby for helping me dispel my concerns and making my recovery trip very successful.
A small suggestion for the hotel, the gym in B1 is not very good, the place is relatively small, and it is not breathable. It would be great if it could be moved to the first floor to look at the green plants outside.

In short, the three-day and two-night itinerary was very fulfilling, and the children had a super happy time. It is worth the money!

msg:The overall environment of the hotel is very good, the room is very clean and comfortable, and the room with a heated swimming pool is very good. Although I just went down to play for a while, the breakfast is very rich, but you may need to queue up. We went to have breakfast at almost nine o'clock the next day and queued for about ten minutes. If there are many people like the Grand Hyatt Hotel, the dinner venue can be temporarily opened as breakfast. It is worth praising that the self-service afternoon tea is very worthwhile! There are not only small cakes, but also smoked salmon, crepes, etc., which are very good. We didn't have lunch when we came back from Wuzhizhou Island, and we were full of afternoon tea. Haha~ There is a small road across the road next to the hotel to go to the beach. When we went there, a wooden plank road was being repaired. It should be more convenient to go to the beach in the future. There is no one on the beach, which is very suitable for a daze and walk. Finally, the only bad thing is that there is still construction next to the hotel. The scenery is not very good. It is also a little noisy during the day, but it doesn't affect much. Finally, I mentioned it to the hotel casually and gave a small gift~ There are slow charging piles in the underground garage of the hotel, and there are several fast charging piles on the ground, which is also very convenient to drive. In short, this hotel is really cost-effective and worth experiencing👍

I will choose here next time😊, the only shortcoming is that the variety of buffet dinner dishes generally did not meet expectations (maybe the previous afternoon tea experience was too good😂) but the breakfast met psychological expectations. In short, it is still a hotel worth trying. 👍👍👍

msg:This is definitely a treasure hotel, but it is delayed by the name (it sounds like a retirement hotel).
1. As a Marriott hotel, although it is a new hotel, the overall service is in place. Every staff member will greet you politely, even those young employees who seem to have just been recruited. Even if the service is a little immature sometimes, it can be seen that the training is in place. At that time, I asked if the items in the room refrigerator were free, and the answer was no, but I was immediately sent a lot of drinks and beer, which was a**ospheric.
2. The hotel design is light luxury, Japanese style, and many places have a good sense of design, and the holiday a**osphere is full.
3. The swimming pool is great, whether it is a large or small swimming pool. The great thing about the small swimming pool is that adults can also play on the slide.
4. The hotel food is good, especially the dregs vinegar of the buffet dinner
5. Children's activities are great, such as surfing teaching, bubble bath, children's facilities are also very good, especially there is a semi-outdoor playground
6. The night ceremony experience is very good, it is recommended to stay for one night to participate
As for the sea view, to be honest, except that it cannot directly access the beach, its sea view is actually good.
Of course, there are some things that may need improvement.
1. The toilet does not have an exhaust fan
2. The leaves and branches at the bottom of the large swimming pool are not cleaned up in a timely manner, and there are too many
3. The elevator is too dark
4. Sometimes it feels like a maze inside, and the instructions are not clear enough
But overall, this is a very good hotel and deserves a full score.

The parent-child activities and children's playgrounds in the hotel alone made the kids not want to go home. The daily room service was warm and thoughtful.

msg:I often visit Taikang Home, and I came to experience it on May Day:

🌴Facilities & Environment: The public areas are quite stylish, modern and design-oriented. The hotel is very new as a whole, opened in 2022, and the style is indeed a little bit like the Edition;
The lobby, swimming pool, and valley garden are all quite distinctive, especially the adult swimming pool, which is about 50 meters long, and swimming enthusiasts are ecstatic~ The children's swimming pool and children's playground are large enough and very friendly to families with children;

🙎Service: I have stayed in many hotels in Sanya. I don't compare with the first-tier hotels, but with hotels of the same level. I feel that the service can be slightly improved. First of all, breakfast. Maybe there were insufficient service staff on May 1st? I wanted an iced latte but couldn't find the staff. Later I asked for a cup of iced coffee and made it myself. It was a bit troublesome. I was already a bit irritated after this. Other hotels just asked for a cup of iced coffee and it was delivered after sitting down. There is still a little gap in service😅 
As for hygiene, on 5.1, the night bed was not made and the room was not cleaned until noon the next day. I was quite dissatisfied. Fortunately, the manager on duty explained and solved the problem in time on the same day, which made up for some of the uncomfortable feelings.

Overall, the cost-effectiveness should be very high in the off-season, and it is also suitable for bringing the whole family to live together. The landscape design is also beautiful. I hope that the details of the service can be improved a little bit~ Overall, it is still recommended

1/TV can cast screen
2/Rich children's activity facilities
3/Overall good reviews for the children's activity center. The staff is good and patient. The sincerity can be felt. This is the only satisfactory point in this stay

Disadvantages:
1/Opening a connecting room for guests without prior notice. At 10:30 pm on the third night of stay, the neighbor first tried to open the connecting door and then knocked on the door quietly, which scared me to death. After careful investigation, I found that I was staying in a connecting room. It was a false alarm
2/Poor facilities and superficial service. Before 7:30 in the morning, the fire emergency light in the room suddenly lit up and could not be turned off. The light was very bright and dazzling. Because the room was too small and the light was very close to the bed, it woke the children up in a short while. I called and waited for more than ten minutes until the engineer came to turn it off. At this time, I was no longer sleepy. The front desk said that the duty manager would call back later, but I didn't wait for an explanation or apology until I checked out
3/Basic room is not comfortable. The room is small. The twin beds cannot be put together. There is no exhaust in the toilet and bathroom. The shower curtain is moldy. The toilet light switch is designed in the toilet. The bathroom switch is designed in the wardrobe. The toilet is in an awkward position I feel like I'm facing a wall when I go to the bathroom. The bathroom door is transparent, so the room cannot be completely darkened, etc.

In summary, you get what you pay for. Taking photos is not the purpose, but having fun is the meaning. The core of a budget hotel cannot provide a five-star experience even if it is listed as a Marriott.

Before we came, the housekeeper Xiaoli arranged the room in advance according to the time we were about to arrive at the store, and upgraded the room type according to our needs. During the stay, she patiently answered all my questions. The most surprising thing is that the hotel has 3 children's swimming pools, which are very interesting and playful. The children had a lot of fun. The swimming pool coach Huang patiently taught the children the hotel's own snorkeling and paddle board courses. Coach Huang's enthusiasm and love for children made the children feel happy, and at the same time greatly increased the children's love for the hotel.

msg:The hotel is very new! What I like most is that the public area design is very transparent, and there are chairs almost everywhere to sit and rest. The children's swimming pool is very large, with large and small slides and water seesaws. The indoor children's playground is not big, but there is a large semi-outdoor children's playground with large slides and climbing nets, trampolines, and small tricycles. It is not hot to play in the evening in this season.

The breakfast selection is very rich, the fruits are fresh, and I had dinner in the Chinese restaurant. It was very light and suitable for the elderly and children.

Overall, except for the lack of its own beach, everything else is very fragrant and cost-effective!

After staying in a hotel for so long, I am the first one to ask for a deposit. Hahaha. Late check-out was allowed at most, but when I checked in, I didn't check in for two or three hours. We stayed at the Hyatt, Grand Hyatt, and Park Hyatt, and they were all cleaned out in advance and waiting. When we checked out, we didn't see any rooms of the same room type being fully booked.

msg:Environment: Vacationing in Sanya/Haitang Bay. It’s a good choice. Currently, the business facilities are the best. Hotels are scattered throughout the Haitang Bay area. The hotel is very selective. This time I chose the Sanya Taikang Tribute Portfolio Hotel, which is quiet in the bustle. It is developed by Marriott Taikang Group. The Tribute Choice luxury hotel managed by the group is extremely beautiful. From the exterior to the interior decoration, the building is designed by the famous designer Neri&Hu himself. During the day, the water courtyard introduces natural light to create a natural and comfortable semi-outdoor space a**osphere. , creating a light environment of Qujing's night view at night, with excellent light and shadow effects. The hotel also prepared a ceremonial lighting ceremony Q, accompanied by beautiful music, allowing everyone to experience an excellent holiday mood. It is currently the most enjoyable stay hotel.
Taitian: It is the hotel’s Chinese restaurant. The 42-meter-long brass chandelier is inspired by fishermen’s lanterns and fishing nets. It is the visual center of the entire space. It expresses the bamboo screen and stone texture to create a friendly and natural light environment. Emphasis on gourmet food through integrated track lighting, creating visual and delicious temptations. The hotel's dishes have Hainanese characteristics. I almost dine at my hotel these days. It is worth recommending, especially the dumplings.
The layout of the guest room is reasonable, and the bathroom is separated from wet and dry. You can soak in the sun in the sunken warm water pool on the balcony, smell the sweet air, or enjoy a relaxing mood in the bathtub in the room, watching TV dramas and listening to music GQG
Serve:
I have stayed in many Marriott hotels. It is commendable that this is a dynamic team and the rooms are extremely clean. After returning from the trip, the temperature and cleanliness of the room will relieve your physical and mental fatigue and have a good rest.
Breakfast: A very high-quality breakfast, both in terms of the freshness of the ingredients, and many dishes are made on site. We recommend the baked bread series. The chef patrols different areas every morning to provide the freshest and most delicious breakfast.
This is the best hotel to experience during the peak tourist season. Whether it is public areas or private areas, whether it is catering or service, it is a high-quality hotel. Thank you to the hotel team for their hard work and giving everyone a pleasant stay experience. 👍👍👍

I was woken up by mosquitoes at two o'clock in the morning and bitten at four o'clock in the morning. It was hot even if I covered myself with a quilt. If I didn't cover myself, I would get bitten.

msg:I grabbed the coupon and was a little worried after reading some bad reviews before coming here, but after I came, I felt it was totally worth the money.
1. Although the breakfast is not as rich as the Westin (Haitang Bay), it is still good overall. The only thing I feel is that the cakes and desserts need improvement. For example, the jujube paste cake has too strong alkali taste.
2. The hotel swimming pool is very big. It is a new hotel after all, and Taikang Insurance is not short of money. It is really grand and the whole corridor is very open. I feel that the public area is a bit wasteful, but the staying experience is very good.
In the bar on the 3rd and 6th floors, you can get 2 free cocktails. I took my son to experience it. I felt that the rooms next to the bar would be noisy at night, so be sure to make sure you stay away from the bar when you check in. We were at 523 and completely avoided it.
4. Due to the peak season, check-in is very slow, so Nick, who has been in guest relations since he got off the plane, has been following up and urging cleaning. After checking out, my son forgot his phone and watch charger, so Nick helped us find a courier to deliver it to us. I don’t know if everyone who makes a reservation will add someone with this kind of guest relationship on WeChat, but it’s really thoughtful and convenient.
5. We purchased a Thai essential oil SPA as a group. The technician is Thai and his massage skills are quite good. You can try it out. I paid 498 yuan per person for a group purchase and gave a tip of 20 yuan. Since foreign guests are accustomed to tipping, I also tipped so as not to make Thai people think that Chinese people are stingy.

He was an architectural designer, and from an architectural design perspective, it was a wonderful hotel.
He is very particular about details such as indirect lighting. If you are interested in architecture, please take a look.

The common areas and rooms are spacious and clean.
The lobby and basin area were well ventilated and cool even in January.

Dinner at the restaurant (extra charge) was delicious.
Breakfast was a buffet and was pretty good.
The staff was also courteous.

The points I'm curious about are:
There is a large Ferris wheel in a remote location that is lit until midnight, so there are rooms where you can see it from your location.
I think it's okay if you close the curtains.

It has a children's swimming pool, an indoor playground, and an outdoor playground. You can play for free when you stay. There is a path that goes 200 meters to the seaside, where you can catch sand crabs. Be sure to sign up for the hotel's crab hunting activity on the beach. The children are really happy when they dig out crabs. The more you want, the more wow you will get. This hotel is a very cost-effective hotel in the Haitang Bay area.

The hotel is a few minutes walk from the beach. It is a wild beach with few people and clear water. Across the way is Wuzhizhou.

Everything in the newly opened hotel in 2022 is new and perfect. I feel that the hotel style is more suitable for young people or people who have their own style preferences. Unlike the five-star hotels I have stayed in in the past, which have always been executive luxury and traditional style, Taikang feels more like home! It has its own unique tone but also gives people the feeling of being open-minded! I want to bring my family to stay next time~

Environment: The environment is very good, but there is no beach. Moreover, the room is small and feels very depressing.
Service: There are relatively few hotel service staff. Therefore, the service is somewhat different from that of a five-star hotel.
The biggest highlight of the hotel is that the catering is good, although it is small. But fine. I think I will come for dinner next time❤️. Not suitable for family accommodation, but may be more suitable for couples.

msg:I have traveled to Sanya many times and have never written a review.
But this hotel really feels so good
Go directly to the conclusion:
I must recommend it to people who go to Haitang Bay. I personally think the overall score is on par with Rosewood and even slightly better in some details ✓✓✓


First of all, I would like to praise the service of the staff member Xiao Le. He called me one day in advance to ask about my needs and the approximate arrival time ➕ to remind me to make an appoin**ent for travel photography in advance.
Secondly, after understanding that I like to shoot, she recommended many outstanding camera spots in the hotel to me. When I asked many questions, she also patiently answered them one by one.
A staff member who has a sense of proportion and security. You can see from here how well the hotel is managed.
Thank you very much Xiaole for your service and letting me experience upupup

Before I made the reservation, I saw some comments saying that the attitude was bad, but I was really satisfied with the three days and two nights here!
It can be said that it is one of the most cost-effective hotels. The newly opened facilities are good➕the service is great➕the breakfast is also good➕there are many activities in the hotel

①The staff will say hello when they see us. There is no exaggerated smile (and no need for such exaggerated service) but polite enough! The entire hotel exudes the kind of a**osphere that I like from the inside out. It is polite and has a sense of boundaries, and all the staff are very gentle.

②There is also a nightfall ceremony in the evening. After writing your wishes, put them on a boat and put them in the pool in the center of the hall (the one with three trees represents health and wealth, and there is something else I forgot haha) It fills you with a sense of ritual~

Room interior:
We stayed in a constant-temperature pool room, with wet and dry separation, a bathtub🛁 and an outdoor constant-temperature pool. Later, I was lazy and my little sisters stayed in the constant-temperature pool (there were still many mosquitoes around at night, so it is recommended to soak during the day). The pool will be disinfected and cleaned every day. Very comfortable, the bed is also comfortable
This price is completely cost-effective

There are two swimming pools downstairs, one is 1.3 meters for adults, and the other is a children's pool. I would like to praise the safety of the children's pool. My little sister and I played on the slide. Logically speaking, the management of the pool for adults can watch from a distance. But the young lady still walked up to us and watched us slide. When asked why, she said that if someone slides a long slide, they must stand in place.

I highly recommend this hotel. What impresses me about a good hotel is not only the hardware but also the details in all aspects.

The room is consistent with the picture of the reservation, the muji wind is full, the swimming pool is very clean, and the staff has been cleaning up fallen leaves. Can’t finish scanning…
The housekeeper Xiao Le was very considerate. She contacted me the day before check-in and arranged the room type and breakfast for the next day. She was responsive to all my requests during my stay. I also had more dining options based on her recommendations.
When checking in, the front desk informed and confirmed the rights and interests involved one by one. The breakfast was also very rich. I couldn't stop eating the Baoluo powder. The overall service was very considerate. Unfortunately, the weather was not good on the day I checked in, but the hotel environment is really good. It’s not too trendy, and it’s fun to just walk around. There is a night-time ceremony in the lobby in the evening, the resident singer is full of energy, and the a**osphere is full. In short, it is a great experience. I will choose Taikang next time I have the opportunity!

The check-in experience was very average.
1. Without advance communication from the staff, my check-in information could not be found when I checked in at the front desk. The Eason who checked me in should still have a manager-level position... I waited at the front desk for 5 or 6 minutes before he found me. After making a reservation, I was informed that they had upgraded me. Then when I went back to the room, I saw that it had been decorated with family-friendly arrangements from my original room type. I was shocked! I was given a parent-child room as a couple. What kind of brain circuit is this? Then I asked to change rooms. The front desk called me and told me that there was only one room type with a bad view. I went to the front desk again and said that I wanted to change rooms. The funny thing happened again. Yes, I got a room after I went to the front desk. The so-called sea view room in the hotel only has a sea view from the corner of the balcony, which is really rubbish. There is no minibar in the room. There is a refrigerator but it is empty. There is no welcome fruit.
2. Don’t go to the hotel spa. It’s even more rubbish. It feels like a slaughterhouse.
3. It’s also hard to describe the hotel’s guest room hygiene.
4. The only good thing is the breakfast in the hotel. The rest is really not worthy of my points.

⚠️Ctrip cannot delete my reviews in any form. This is my real experience and real review!

msg:The rooms and public areas are very clean. The entire hotel has a light and simple style, which is very suitable for tourists who like quiet. The swimming pool is also very clean. The children's playground is also good. The indoor area is suitable for babies under 3 years old! The outdoor area is suitable for older children, with fewer parent-child activities! Although the breakfast area is not big, it has basically everything you need, and it is delicious. Afternoon tea is also good! In addition, I think the best thing about the entire hotel is the service, which is really not inferior to the first-tier big-name hotels! The only drawback is that there is no beach, but all the hotels in this row are like this. But I heard that the road is being built, and in the future there will be direct access from the hotel to the beach, which would be perfect! I will still choose to stay at this hotel in the future! Minimal but not simplify

The hotel is across the road from the beach, which takes about ten minutes to walk.

msg:The hotel environment is very good, but the service is terrible. The hotel has so many special projects. When checking in, the staff only told me that there are free travel photos (the so-called travel photos will definitely cost money in the end), other performances, parent-child activities, etc. They didn’t introduce any of them, and they didn’t take the initiative to mention them. It wasn’t until I asked myself that they said they were available. By the time I asked, I had already missed a lot of parent-child activities. The hotel's water park also has no sunshade measures and closes on time at 6 pm. With the weather so hot and the sun so strong, 6 pm is the best time to play in the water, okay? Originally, I was interested in the family-friendly activities in the hotel, but I basically didn’t get to enjoy them. There is also an elevator. You need to swipe your card to press the floor, but there is a problem with the elevator's card sensor! ! ! The first time I thought there was a problem with the card, so I ran back to get the card again. The staff who knew about it said that there was a problem with the sensor. There were only two elevators, and there was a problem with one of them. Every time I encountered the elevator with the problem, every time I have to swipe it dozens of times before I can feel it! ! ! The most expensive hotel I booked during the entire trip. I originally planned to stay in the hotel and have fun, but unexpectedly it turned out to be the hotel with the worst experience!

msg:Room: The decoration style is simple, with wood tones, new facilities, and the toiletries taste good.
Environment: The location is not directly close to the sea. You need to take a trail to the seaside, but it does not affect it. Because of this, it is extremely quiet. The interior environment of the hotel is very spacious. The first floor has excellent height and a strong sense of space. The pool in the middle silences the entire lobby, making it quiet and suitable for vacation. Sleep quality is also high in such an environment.
Service: Very attentive, mainly reflected in being upgraded to a room type (high-rise sea view) right from the time of check-in, guest relations Xiaole invited me to add WeChat without disturbing too much, provided various warm reminders during the stay, proactively provided late check-out, and helped with travel photography appoin**ents , because she found out that there was no coffee machine in the room and we were not used to it, she gave us coffee coupons. On the day of check-out, she also reminded us to participate in the coffee festival. I don’t remember the names of the concierge guys, but every time I come back to the hotel, they greet me, smile, and carry my luggage. They are very polite and their uniforms look good. I praise you~ We stayed on the sixth floor of Building A. I have been a thin man these days. The beautiful lady cleans the room, and her smile is so heartwarming.
Bar: Cocktails at Haiyan Bar 🍹Biao Yang~ The group purchase coupons are very cost-effective. The coffee coupons given by Xiao Le can also be exchanged for wine. I was not confident about it. When we went to the lobby bar on the first floor to exchange coffee, the beautiful short-haired manager reminded us that today is free. For coffee, you can keep the coupons and exchange them for wine. Everyone is so down to earth!
Breakfast: Breakfast in every resort hotel is worth looking forward to. The breakfast environment of this hotel is very good, the food is good, and it is not too noisy, maybe because we traveled at the wrong time.
All in all, Taikang House is very cost-effective, with a new hotel and considerate service. It is still a good choice among the many five-star luxury hotels in Haitang Bay. Recommend✌️

But it is too far from the beach. It takes ten minutes to walk and we have to walk through a deserted protective forest... pushing the baby against the high temperature is really unbearable.

msg:Rationally speaking, highly recommended!
I originally booked a B&B in Yalong Bay, but my one-night stay was not as good as expected, so I switched to a hotel in Haitang Bay. Fortunately, I chose this treasure hotel!
I came over to book a room on the morning of the 3rd. The lady at the front desk, Nicole, reminded me that there were no good seats at the moment. She helped to keep an eye on the rooms that were available in the afternoon. I came over in the afternoon and opened the door. It was a big surprise. I don’t know if I got a free upgrade to a sea view room. Although it has a second-tier sea view, it is also very nice with the garden landscape. I originally planned to move to Sanya Bay Airport near Sanya Bay on my last day, but I decided not to leave as soon as I entered the hotel. I stayed until the last minute, and the considerate lady Nicole even offered a free late check-out until 2 o'clock.
The hotel itself is a great place to take photos and check in. The food and beverages are also very rich and the service is in place. It is the biggest surprise of this trip to Sanya!

The lights are beautiful at night and the wind is very comfortable. The service provided by Ruby at the front desk was very good, responsive to all requests, and very considerate. The service staff you encounter in the hotel can take the initiative to say hello. Kids love the kids pool and clubhouse and the outdoor playground. The self-service laundry room is so convenient. Perhaps the only regret is that it is not directly connected to the coast, but it only takes seven or eight minutes to walk across the road to the seaside, and the scenery is very good. The gift coupon for Haichang Sleepless City was exchanged for the Flying Cinema. It was more fun than expected. Like it.

Because there is only 1 swimming pool for adults, so I lived in a room with a swimming pool and I liked the comfort of the room, you can go for lunch for lunch, paying 260 yuan, for dinner you can also go down to the Swedish table. The breakfast was varied, there was an assor**ent of freshly squeezed juices, stylish music was playing in the background, on the 6th floor I sat in the bar in the evening, from there there were beautiful views of the island. Everything in the hotel is very quiet and calm, so it is only for a relaxing holiday. To get to the sea you had to walk across the road to the other side, but the passage to the sea is in a very cluttered condition, there is terrible dirt on the road, but it is clear that this has nothing to do with the hotel.

msg:The hotel environment and facilities are very good, but the breakfast variety is much simpler than other hotels in Haitang Bay (Tianfang InterContinental, Fairmont, Sofitel). Breakfast is in the Western restaurant, but the Chinese restaurant tastes really good. I used the Marriott Gold Card when paying the bill, which is very cost-effective. Although we arrived very late on the first night, the Chinese restaurant in the hotel also has dining services for the convenience of guests. Nancy arranged a studio suite with sea view, and also applied for a free extra bed and breakfast for us. Thank you very much. The room has a good view. The downstairs faces the swimming pool and you can also see the sea from the side. The indoor children's playground, outdoor children's pool and children's swimming pool are very new. The two children had a lot of fun, but please note that there is no free mineral water in the swimming pool and you need to bring your own. The most amazing thing is that when we were having afternoon tea, the on-site person in charge named Guo Yue delivered two boxes of specialties, saying they would be given to the elderly in our family. He also asked grandma to open a box on the spot to see what was inside. Grandma was very happy after reading it. I was so happy that I even said thank you. When we finished eating and were about to leave, another waiter came over and said that the wrong delivery was made. This was a specialty product that needed to be purchased. It cost 218 per box, which greatly affected our happy mood. To make up for it, they applied to send us one box, but grandma said that she saw many people going out with two boxes. An episode that ruined the impression of the Marriott Hotel. The light-up activity at night is quite creative, but the paint on the boat smells too strong and is not very environmentally friendly. I hope it can be improved.

msg:The hotel is very new, and the decoration style is also designer style. The overall wooden color tone is relatively simple and elegant. The hotel's breakfast is a buffet with many options, and there are activities in the evening. Before arriving at the hotel, Miss Ruby called in advance to ask about our needs and overall reception. She also upgraded our room type. We were really happy when the baby was running around the house. The service was very attentive. She even reminded me when my eyes were swollen. The attention and care are also in place, and the overall experience is super good. There is a children's water pool in the swimming pool, but it is a pity that babies are too young to play in it. The children's playground has three areas which are also very good. Smaller babies are very suitable for playing in the ocean ball pool. The only drawback is that you need to cross the road to get to the beach, but the beach outside the hotel is really good. It is very suitable for taking photos and checking in while watching the sunrise in the morning. The hotel is relatively close to Linwang Night Market, Haichang Evernight City, duty-free shops, and the 301 Military Region Hospital, and is worth recommending.

msg:The hotel opened in 2022. It is relatively new. The location is relatively close to the whole Haitang Bay. With Taikang in the name, those who didn’t pay attention don’t know that it is a hotel under Marriott, except for the right side of Building B facing the sea. Construction, balcony view is relatively poor. The rest are all good reviews. Because I booked two rooms and stayed twice, the view on the other side is very good. Although it is only a side view of the sea, there are Ferris wheels. After all, the price is here. The price/performance ratio is still very high. The hotel's big gift package service is very good. Children can play in the children's center for a day without parents worrying about it. The staff in the children's center are very responsible and nice. The breakfast was not photographed, but it is rich. Basically, eating breakfast and lunch together is enough. In addition, I also bought their buffet dinner at 538, which is not bad. If you are too lazy to go out, you can eat at the hotel. The swimming pool and children's water park are very good, the waiters are well equipped, and even the adults have fun on the slides in the children's center. The most important beach is very fine sand. The opposite is Wuzhizhou Island. There are no people on the whole beach, clean and hygienic. The uncomfortable place to go to the beach is that the sign to go to the beach after crossing the road is not clear. You have to go through a forest and still The temporary forest path is not a normal municipal road, it feels a bit like a jungle adventure. The room is clean and hygienic, and there is a free minibar to eat and drink. The children are very happy.

The overall hotel is a five-star praise, and the vacation is comfortable.

Service: The front desk staff who checked in at the hotel were very polite and polite. (Wenwen the female front desk) saw that there was a child, and specially gave me an ice cream coupon. Also because check-in was late the day before, the check-in was delayed by 1 hour, which was great. The service is meticulous! It’s almost the same as going to the Maldives a few years ago! 😂
Btw, if the buffet and breakfast of the hotel were to be given a perfect score of 10, I would give it an 8. (The quality of the steaks and lamb chops at the buffet was slightly inferior.) But the quality of the shrimps, scallops, and snails was an 8, which was great. I hope it is better.
Already recommended to friends! I wish you better and better, and come again next time!

msg:Living in Hainan, a holiday destination 🏖️
I must 🉐️ take a quick trip on the weekend~

Check in to the "Taikang House" hotel 🏨 (managed by Marriott Group)

1⃣️The day before I checked in, the hotel staff Ruby called me in advance and the arrangement was very satisfactory! The room has a good view and is close to the elevator. Going downstairs directly leads to the children's playground. Even going to the swimming pool is super convenient. The hotel is very big, but fortunately 🈶️Ruby is thoughtful [smiley face], so attentive:
2⃣️If a parent-child family is staying, of course you must experience and participate in parent-child activities. Figure 9 is the activity schedule. 🌟Key points: No matter which hotel it is for parent-child activities, remember to make a reservation with the hotel in advance! Avoid being unable to participate when the quota is full. The parent-child activities I participated in this time were all reserved by my family. I was so touched. I was worried that her child would be cancelled, but I didn’t expect that the coaches and staff were very attentive to teaching;
3⃣️The playground is divided into indoor and outdoor, suitable for babies of different ages. There is also a children's swimming pool. The water slide is so enjoyable. My son has played it dozens of times! [Laughing through tears]
4⃣️The overall service quality of the hotel staff is very high. It was my first time to have breakfast in a five-star hotel. Someone arranged the location. The service was the same as that of the buffet dinner. The whole environment was very quiet and comfortable. The pastries for breakfast were delicious. For the first time, I refused an omelette just to have one more bite of European bread;
5⃣️The hotel also gave away tickets to Haichang Evernight City. The hotel is very close to Evernight City and Linwang Night Market. There are still many places to go around.

Satisfaction given by our family of four👨👩👧👦💯
I also lived in Autograph many years ago.
At that time, I didn’t think Marriott’s service was so good!
Once again refreshed my understanding of the Marriott series

All staff (front desk, cleaning, security, etc.) will greet you and make you feel at home.
Thanks to the front desk - NAACY, the service attitude is very good, patiently solve all the problems before and after check-in, the people are super nice.
I would like to commend the hotel staff - Cen Guangteng. He is a serious person who deserves to be remembered by everyone. During the stay, we encountered some difficult difficulties and solved them with his patient help. Thank you very much. I am very lucky to meet two such good people. staff member.
The hotel is equipped with a self-service laundry room, two washing machines and one dryer. After washing, press "Start" to fix it for half an hour. The ** operation is very easy to use. Select "Ready to Wear" for the dryer, which takes about 1 hour. Bake well.
The interior of the hotel is very easy to take pictures of. You can see every step of the way. The buffet breakfast in Manyuan is 198 yuan/person and the buffet dinner is 459 yuan/2 people. It is highly recommended if you have a budget. There are rich varieties. Marriott members can enjoy Buddha Jumping over the Wall for dinner.
Generally, travel photography will be given when booking. One room will give you 5 free photos. You need to make an appoin**ent in advance. After taking the photos, you will be asked to select photos on the room computer. The extra 50 yuan/photo is a bit expensive.
You can get to the beach by walking out of the hotel door and across the road. It is very convenient to take pictures of the beach, but you need to go through a forest to get to the beach. The forest has a Harry Potter dark wind, and there are too many mosquitoes, so be careful.
Two surprising points:
1. The directions of hot and cold water in the showers in my friend's and my room's rooms are reversed.
Even the engineering depar**ent didn't know it, and it took a front desk staff member from behind to figure it out.
2. The hotel provided dental floss, but the staff thought they were toothpicks.
After repeatedly confirming that the hotel does not provide dental floss, I was surprised when I took it apart.

msg:Facilities: Very complete. Don’t worry if you have children. There are children’s playgrounds, swimming pools, etc. I must say that the breakfast is very delicious. I have stayed in so many hotels and this place really surprised me. Breakfast ends at 10.30. I promised not to miss breakfast. !
Hygiene: Very clean. The air in the public area and the room is fresh. The bedding, bath towels and bathrobes are all clean and hygienic. It is very safe to use.
Environment: The overall decoration style is very good, the color matching is very warm and elegant, giving people a feeling of freedom and stretching, and the public area can be used to take a photo anywhere.
Service: The experience was overwhelming on the day I checked in. Nancy, the lady at the front desk, provided great service because I wanted a good view and a good view. Nancy said she didn’t have a particularly good room, so she upgraded my room type for free and added another person. Breakfast, to be honest, I originally booked the itinerary for two days, but later I discussed with my friends to extend my stay for one more night. Both the service and the facilities and environment were amazing, absolutely worth it!

msg:Pros: The hotel is very new, has a sense of design, the bedding is comfortable, the swimming pool is beautiful, and the water is clean.
Disadvantages: To get to the beach, you need to cross the road and walk through a virgin forest to reach it. There is something wrong with the washbasin cabinet in the room. It is on the floor and there is no place to put your feet. You can't get close to the faucet and sink when washing your face. In addition, there is no exhaust fan in the toilet and shower room, and there is no slope in the shower room, so the water on the floor cannot drain away after taking a shower.

msg:Stayed for 6 nights and it was great. The hotel is quite big. It is easy to go wrong if you are not familiar with the route at first, but it is very comfortable after you become familiar with it. The overall design of the hotel is natural, not mindless luxury, but it is so close to nature that people can truly relax. The adult swimming pool is very large, I heard it is 60 meters long. The water is very clean and you can see directly from one end to the other.
As for the breakfast, perhaps due to the off-season, there are not enough breakfast categories, but the quality of each item is pretty good, and the lady at the noodle stall is super enthusiastic.
It is worth mentioning that the "Sea Salt Bar" located on the 6th floor of Building A is well worth a visit. I went there for several nights and every drink was delicious. The "Pina Colada" prepared by the beautiful manager is the best I have ever tasted. One cup! After drinking, I went back to my room to sleep until dawn.
All the staff here are meticulous and enthusiastic, and the room service is very fast. Manager Zhang from the catering depar**ent also gave me a heart-warming souvenir before leaving. Thank you.
Of course, there are a few problems. First, there are no coffee and tea bags in the room, and there are no glasses and other utensils. Maybe it's because I booked a basic room. Second, very few plates in the buffet restaurant feel that they have not been wiped clean and have a slightly greasy feeling, which is worthy of improvement. Third, there are only two hooks in the guest room. It is difficult to place towels, bathrobes, etc. It is beautiful but not practical enough.
The faults do not hide the faults. In short, Taikang House is well worth staying, and the longer you stay, the more comfortable it becomes. I hope the hotel will get better and better. See you in the future!

She arrived at around three in the morning and checked in quickly. She also picked a room with a great view for us. The road leading to the seaside from behind the hotel passes through a small forest. It is very primitive and unique. It is an unexpected bonus from this trip. Girls will definitely like it. It is very interesting (but you may be scared to walk by yourself).

msg:Let me talk about the sanitation of this hotel first. It is really very average as shown in the picture. The room is not cleaned properly, there are small spider webs in the room, and the ground pool is not cleaned properly. I don’t recommend sensitive people to play in the swimming pool.
     Let’s talk about other things. Children’s activities are okay, but it’s a bit confusing. In addition, the activities at 11:00 and 2:00 in the activity table below are charged, and the rest are free. The breakfast is not bad, and there are many types of bread, just to avoid the peak period
      Another final point is that there are no views around the hotel. They are all empty and unfinished buildings. There are also helicopters. The one with helicopters is the double-numbered room in Building A. I think it is very noisy. The balcony on the second floor faces the interior of the hotel. It is a room with a small pool, and above the third floor, there are balconies, and the balconies are not small
 
   Overall not bad, except for the hygiene and the attitude of some staff

msg:I chose the hotel in Haitang Bay before going out, and found this newly opened Taikang Home. At first, I was always misled by his name and thought it was a pension type. Later, I found out that it was owned by Marriott, and it was relatively new, and the price was also cheap. suitable. The other hotels I stayed in before were a bit old and expensive, so I finally chose the designer hotel Taikang Home, the Ultimate Choice for two nights. After experiencing it with my friends and family, I thought it was a good choice🤭
The room size and facilities are very good, with a wide view, and a 4,000-square-meter children's swimming pool. The children are there for half a day every day, and they are very happy. Children's amu*****t facilities are also suitable for different age groups, and they participated in the fun camp. The hotel facilities are very new, the breakfast is rich, and the flow of people is controlled during the peak period, and the waiting time is not long to ensure the dining experience. The Chinese food for the 4 people in the evening group was also very satisfactory. The hotel does not have a private beach, but it takes five or six minutes to walk across the road to the beach. The beach is a bit amazing, with few people, the beach is clean and delicate, and the sea is very shallow, suitable for digging sand and stepping on waves. But no one is watching, everyone pay attention to the safety of the wind and waves. In particular, the service of the hotel is very nice. Every staff member I met took the initiative to greet me. Special thanks to Ruby, the guest relations director of the hotel who received us. He is very nice and considerately solved various problems for us. Next time in Haitang Bay, I will choose Taikang Home Premium Products🤭

Compared with those old-fashioned hotels, I like this kind of relaxed leisure. The only disadvantage is that I can't go directly to the beach🏖️. Advance booking price discount
When you go to Sanya, you will inevitably have to go to the beach. A lot of clothes need to be washed. The hotel has a self-service laundry room, which is very convenient

It’s not too late to pick up the money: The child’s watch was forgotten in the bathroom. Dong Yueying, a hotel staff member, picked it up and returned it to us. Thank you so much

Good service: Nicole at the front desk is super nice. She extended the check-out time for us. The child was very happy to be able to swim more and gave us some snacks. Thank you very much. Sister Yan from the guest room depar**ent found out that we had children, so she took the initiative to send us children's toiletries, which is very considerate

The scenery is beautiful: the hotel has a strong sense of design, and the scenery is everywhere. It is very beautiful to take pictures casually. The beach is really not far away. It takes less than ten minutes to walk there. The sea water is very clear and there are no people. It is especially suitable for travel photography. There is also a hotel garden with a particularly beautiful landscape.

Good facilities: The hotel room is very clean, the facilities are very new, the bedding is very comfortable, adults and children are very satisfied, compared with the Sheraton the day before yesterday, the gap is very big. The shampoo and shower gel in the room are not disposable, but they are very fragrant and easy to use. The Children's Paradise is also very suitable for children, and there is also a free laundry room, but there are too many people doing laundry and there is no queue

Good food: rich breakfast, child seats and children's tableware, etc. are very friendly to children, and there are staff delivering balloons at the door; the buffet in the evening is particularly delicious, with good seafood and barbecue, and a variety of categories; Yiyuan afternoon tea is exquisite and delicious ; Tai Tian's desserts are not sweet but delicious. The whole family is very satisfied!

There is no ventilation in the bathroom and toilet in the room. . For breakfast, the table is always dirty and greasy! There is a girl who takes the seat, every time she is brought to a huge table, she refuses to change it every time, observing her like this for several days, it is difficult for her to sit down alone! The singular numbers after the end number 63 in Building B are currently close-up construction site views. Except for the above three points, everything else is very good. Haidilao's service is responsive to requests. Although it is often confusing, the response is quick and the attitude is very good. The products of each restaurant are very good! Inexpensive, freshly made! Beijing tourists who had had enough of prepared dishes were pleasantly surprised hahaha. There are 4 children's playgrounds, and there are three indoor and outdoor semi-outdoor water parks. The free self-service laundry is very convenient, and you don't need to bring laundry detergent, you need to queue up yourself. Check-in was very slow, but check-out was very fast. The bellman took the room card and sent me to the car directly. I was also stupid. Go out from the swimming pool and cross a small road to the beach. There is no development, the sand is fine and the beach is gentle, which is very good!

I think this is really ridiculous. I live in the new but not the old. I like the style very much. That's why I booked this hotel, which made me call the hotel in advance. I've arranged rooms and nothing like this has ever happened to me! ! The service is really indescribable, except for the waiters of the parent-child paradise, the parent-child area is quite hardworking! Praise 👍
The whole location is actually very inside of Haitang Bay, very close to the city that never sleeps, but the city that never sleeps is not recommended! Just watch the fireworks on the weekend. Also, you have to cross the road from the beach and pass through a small forest, which feels very wild.

Generally speaking, I am very satisfied. It is a pity that I have not experienced the hotel bar after only staying for two days. If there is a chance, I hope to stay some more days.

Environment: The hotel was newly opened last year and this year. The pool in the lobby has a sense of design, with a touch of Chinese style. In some places, statues are placed in the hotel, and public art is integrated into the design. Small ornaments are also placed in the elevator. The light and shadow in the corridor are very beautiful, especially at sunset
Service: In addition to the lobby, the aunt who is in charge of receiving guests and cleaning the room also thoughtfully left a note when cleaning the room to clean up the uneaten and edible ones, but in fact we didn't eat it, but through the aunt's instructions The text still feels caring. The younger brother and younger sister who work in the Yuxian Chinese restaurant of the hotel are also more enthusiastic and responsive
Hygiene: The room is very clean. After all, the bedding is relatively new. Needless to say, the sofa is also relatively clean. Generally, no matter what hotel you have stayed in for a few years, the sofa will be dirty. Every time you dare not sit on this sofa, it is still relatively clean. I hope it can be maintained. The rest of the hotel is also very clean. In short, it gives people a clean, fresh and simple feeling
Facilities: The wind blowing from the hair dryer is a bit hot. The hotel has two swimming pools. One is bigger and has a slide. You can also have food delivered to the room when you order the hotel’s supper, but there are fewer dishes.
This location and the environment are relatively affordable. Compared with the Hilton that lived in Yazhou District a few days ago, it is much better. It takes ten minutes to the duty-free shop and half an hour to Yalong Bay.

In terms of sanitation, the room is very clean and tidy. The sanitation standard is higher than that of Grand Hyatt Haitang Bay, with details everywhere. The hangers are half wood and half leather, and all the supplies in the room are very textured. In fact, the quality of the hotel is reflected in the details and services. The four words under Marriott are indeed quality assurance. The hotel's swimming pool is heated, very large, very clean, and children like it very much. The management is also very user-friendly, because our flight in the afternoon had a hasty check-out at 12 o'clock, and the communication with the front desk was also delayed by an hour. The breakfast is slightly inferior to Grand Hyatt, and the variety is not as rich as Grand Hyatt, but it is good enough for the price of 1,000 yuan. The only disadvantage is that the hotel is not facing the sea, and it takes a while to walk across a road to the beach, but for children, the recreational facilities in the hotel are enough. I didn't expect this hotel to surprise me. If I come to Haitang Bay again, I will stay again.

But on the first day of check-in, the speed was really slow. The room assigned to me on the first night was not very satisfactory. The view on the opposite side was not very good. The house was being built, and the sound of construction started at 8 o'clock in the morning. Watch it at night Got a cockroach in the balcony. On the second day, the staff helped us change the room and put it in a room with a pool view opposite. The view is really much better.

The water park is enough for small children, but they can only swim until 7:00 in the evening, and it is better to be later. The children's paradise is divided into indoor, semi-indoor and outdoor, and it is enough for children to play. It is also very convenient to take a taxi from the hotel to nearby eating places and the Duty Free City. It would be even better if there is a road to the nearby beach and some construction.

msg:The hotel is newly opened, it is really worth staying in the Haitang Bay area, the hardware facilities are perfect, and it is hygienic and clean! The facilities for the little ones include an indoor children's playground, a semi-outdoor playground, an outdoor sandy playground, a swimming pool children's playground, and a valley garden. They stayed in a hotel for two days and had a great time.

Let’s talk about the service. I hope it can be done better. First of all, the toilet set and bathrobes are very good, which is much better than when I switched to Sofitel later. But the room service needs to be strengthened. Every time I call, I have to wait for 5-10 minutes. This is a bit unexpected. There is basically no service in the cafeteria. Compared with the hotels in the back, the gap is too big. The hotel waiters in the back can accompany my little friends when they see that I am alone with my baby. Yes, there is no service here except to bring a seat. The best service in the entire hotel goes to the concierge at the door! ! ! Every time I get out of the car, I open the door, help me take out my little friend, and carry my luggage!

Finally, I have a proposal. I hope to repair the plank road through the windbreak forest to go to the seaside. It doesn’t cost a lot of money, and a battery car will be provided for pick-up and drop-off, so that the hotel will have a beach. It is very attractive for those who bring their children to dig sand, and they can live directly. I didn't change hotels for a week because I had to change hotels because there was no beach.

The price of 1,000 per night including breakfast for two people is really affordable.
What's more, the Children's Paradise is simply a paradise for children. Adults can watch dramas freely, as long as they leave the children to the staff. Various experience activities are arranged every day, and the water sports are also rich and varied. , attached two children's playground project sheets. The attitude of the park attendants is also very good. The children are as close as friends to them, especially the all-round coach Huang Gang. Not only is he proficient in all items, but he can also carefully teach the children every movement and guide them patiently. This trip was very successful, thanks to every employee of the hotel

msg:It’s quite cold when I come to Sanya to play in the water in winter. I didn’t play in the hotel swimming pool. It looks very suitable for children. It’s just that the weather is too cold and I can’t go into the water. I was asked to add a WeChat message to talk about the butler service, but when I asked questions on WeChat, the butler didn’t reply. Fortunately, I’m not the one. If you have a lot of things to do, don't reply if you don't want to. I upgraded to a constant-temperature swimming pool room, but the water is cold at all. Where the temperature is constant, I installed a mesh door on the balcony door to ventilate the room without fear of mosquitoes. Because it was very humid and stuffy after taking a shower, I opened the balcony door to ventilate. Three minutes later, mosquitoes came in, biting the child seven or eight times, and he was allergic. He took Lutadine to feel better. The design of the hotel is quite nice, but the small details are not perfect.

Because of my lg birthday, I am very grateful here Ruby at the front desk, the room arrangement is really satisfactory, the sea on the side, the swimming pool on the front, very caring and gentle, and even arranged a cake for us on our birthday, so thoughtful. Because you made us feel comfortable and comfortable throughout the three days. In fact, as soon as we arrived at the room, we wanted to change the tfzj order for the next two days. We wanted to continue staying here. The room facilities are so new that it makes people feel at ease and relaxed. I don’t want to stay in the hotel at all Moving, let’s talk about the details. The hotel lobby is very suitable for punching in. The breakfast is rich. Wherever you go in the hotel, the waiters you meet along the way will take the initiative to say hello with a smile. The towels and bathrobes in the room are small, medium and large for three people. The hair dryer is from Dyson. The shower gel smells very good. The swimming pool is very beautiful. There is also a special area for children. The drinks and nuts in the small refrigerator are free. The layout of the room Reasonable, there is a cloakroom with a full-length mirror, there is a storage room, the toilet is separated from the shower room, the shower room is super large, and there is an office area. I and I agree that the price will increase here in the future. This price is invincible, really unbeatable Picky, there are still many advantages that I can think of so much for now, anyway, I will definitely choose this place again in the future. The last night is still undecided, and I plan to stay here again.

She even upgraded me to two rooms for free... and patiently explained and led the way, and suddenly felt warm in my heart. The little brother who served breakfast was also very polite and gave me a salmon snack. I decided to apply for membership
Hygiene: Hygiene is also good, the room is clean, the only downside is that the drainage in the bathroom is a bit slow, and the water quality in the public area is also clear and transparent, which is great
Environment: The simple and light luxury style is my favorite type. The aisle design of the room is also full of artistic sense, the white water chestnut design, and the partial micro-cement ceiling wall design, which is also great. The log style of the room matches the greenery outside the balcony The landscape looks like a sea, which is clean and comfortable...

During the whole stay, all kinds of services are in place. The bed is very comfortable, very clean, and there is check-in fruit. It seems that the exhaust function of the bathroom is so-so. I like the design style of the hotel very much. It feels like a new Chinese style. It has traditional elements but is simple and not rustic. The combination of the overall color of the hotel and the green plants makes it feel inexplicably next to the desert. The breakfast is also good, but there are too many people for breakfast, and the service is a bit chaotic, but it doesn't affect the overall experience. There is also a shared battery car at the gate, and you can go to the night market to eat leisurely with the evening breeze, perfect!

Personally, I think this hotel gave me the best impression during the few days I came to Sanya. 7 days and 6 nights, I stayed in Yanlord and Tianyu Taikang House respectively. The name of this hotel gives people the first impression that it looks like a recreation center for the elderly, but don't be fooled by the name. This is a hotel owned by Marriott. The price/performance ratio is super high, and the hotel is also very new. It is said that it is a hotel that is delayed by the name, the Little Edition Hotel. For children, the indoor playground is also good, and there are several relatively large children's pools outside. The function is very good, and the attitude of the service staff is quite good. We brought our children here, so we chose parent-child hotels as much as possible. We also stayed at Tianyu Hotel. Tianyu feels that the facilities are a bit old. Yanlord Crown is not cost-effective, not worth 2,000 nights. This hotel is highly praised, except that it does not have its own beach area, there are almost no shortcomings. It is very convenient to eat and take a taxi.

The wooden system of the room has a Japanese-style feel, and the sense of space is quite good.
Ms. Zhu at the front desk was patient and thoughtful and helped solve the problem. I would like to express my gratitude here.
It is not very convenient to cross a road and a piece of original ecological forest by the sea, but the seaside is quiet and there are few people, and no one will compete with you for the scenery.
The hotel pool is a bit small, which is a pity. But if you can go swimming at 8:30, it is basically an exclusive pool. It is a pity that the swimming pool is closed after ten o'clock in the evening. The children's pool can be stopped, and the large pool should be allowed to stay overnight. Safety issues can require free time in the swimming pool to be the responsibility of the tourists themselves.

When I came to Sanya last year, I passed by the newly opened hotel and I always thought that Taikang's health care is really good. Such a luxurious hotel simply beats others. Kangyang two streets. Because it is the first time for my daughter-in-law to come, we have been experiencing different hotels. We have lived in the mangroves of Yalong Bay, the crown of Sanya Bay, and the mangroves of Haitang Bay. It was not until we saw this hotel on Ctrip that we found out that it was actually not The place for health and wellness is a hotel operated by Marriott Group. After choosing to stay, I found out that the overall facilities of the hotel are very new, and there are many places for entertainment. Even because I went to the duty-free city, I stayed for two days. I haven’t finished the experience, the room facilities are perfect, what is unexpected is that there is a bath towel in the room, the northerners are ecstatic (there are too many others, see the picture for details), and Ruby at the reception is also very enthusiastic and provided me with a lot Helped and helped me upgrade the room type. What surprised me the most was knowing that when I went to make an appoin**ent the next day, Ruby could call out my last name when I didn’t provide any information and there were so many guests staying. A wedding trip has a perfect ending. Of course, there are some shortcomings. 1. The hotel does not have a private beach (Haitang Bay belongs to the outer bay and the wind and waves are too strong to go to the sea, so if you want to go to the sea to play a private beach, it is recommended to rent a car to Yalong Bay) 2. Gome’s Guotai Kangbei 😂, Gome Group located on the left side of the hotel The project is unfinished, and now the Sanya Municipal Government is taking over the construction. Guests who live on the left side of the hotel may see the construction site and occasionally hear the sound of construction. This is unavoidable. Guests who care about these two points can know in advance.

Facilities: The hotel is relatively new, and the basic facilities are OK
Sanitation: The sanitation in the room is also good
Environment: The overall hotel environment is very good, very suitable for walking children, there are super large outdoor and indoor children's playgrounds, and there is also a children's water park. The facilities are very new, and the baby has a great time playing
Service: The service is also good. The waiters in the restaurant always collect the dishes in time, and the room service requires that the bed be installed. The staff also asked for more mineral water. The consumption of water is very large when you are on an island vacation!

It’s indeed like the kind that some people commented that they will encounter group marketing. , The sound insulation of the room is not good. The child next door cried all night, and I could hear it clearly. The breakfast is not very rich and the taste is ok, but the staff are very dedicated to the service. They are very enthusiastic from getting off the bus to checking in. Thanks to Ruby at the front desk for your patience and help, and the answers to questions are very fast.

The service attitude of the restaurant is not bad, but the sofa in the restaurant is too dirty, many of which are stains, so I dare not do it at all. The buffet dinner included in the room is also very ordinary, with no seafood. The hotel has no sea view at all, and the booked room can only see the construction site and the Ferris wheel! Thanks to the room aunt for the honeymoon arrangement, but there is nothing else except the arrangement. Living in Banyan Tree is welcome fruit, cake and red wine. I should not live in Sanya in the future!

msg:Taikang is the hotel I decided after looking at more than 10 hotels in Haitang District for comparison.
The gate of the hotel is very tall, and the lobby has a comfortable and cozy feeling, blending with nature. Ruby checked us in very fast, gentle, lovely and thoughtful. Ruby also prepared a children's toiletry bag and Baby crib.

Room facilities: Entering the room is clean, tidy and comfortable, with designer brand style, the room has a style decoration introduction, the toilet and bathroom are separated from wet and dry, the balcony is large, comfortable and very quiet, the room has a mini refrigerator, hair dryer, electric mosquito water Wait, the supporting facilities are complete.

Room view: I chose the one facing the garden, with a view of the swimming pool and landscaping at a glance. It is quiet and comfortable at night, without mosquitoes


Breakfast: Buffet-style breakfast, the waiters are very dedicated, the food is complete in Western and Chinese styles, the food is very delicious, the replenishment is timely, there is no looting problem, and the experience is very good.

Sanitation: Regardless of the public areas of the guest rooms, Taikang has achieved the ultimate in sanitation


Location and transportation: Didi Chuxing is the only way to go out, very convenient

Service: The waiters are dedicated and cheerful, and everyone greets us with a smile. Because the baby fell asleep on the day of check-out, I applied for an hour late check-out with Ruby, and Ruby quickly arranged it. We are very grateful to the hotel for being considerate of us.

Swimming pool: Because the baby has not experienced one item, there are few people in the swimming pool. If you go to experience it, you will feel that it is reserved. The pool is very clean and large

Gym: There is a gym

Cost-effectiveness: The price is very reasonable, and the food and beverage prices are very moderate compared with those of restaurants outside, even more delicious than restaurants outside

To sum up the above: The experience of staying in Taikang is very good, it is recommended to stay

msg:I am not a person who likes to write reviews, and this is the first time I have volunteered to write a review for a hotel, but this hotel really made my stay so enjoyable, so I must review it.

facility:
All the facilities are very new, the indoor and outdoor swimming pools are complete, refrigerators, and hair dryers are all very good. The bed was also very comfortable. The bathroom design is very thoughtful, the shower and toilet are separated, and there is a place to sit outside the shower. Lying in the bathroom, soaking in the bath, drinking and watching movies, or soaking in the sun in the indoor swimming pool, I feel very comfortable.

health:
The room, pool, bathroom, everything in the hotel was very clean. Bathrobes, bath towels, sheets are also very clean. Even my clean freak wife gave up on using disposable bed and bath towels at this hotel.

Environment: The environment is very beautiful. The pool surface in the center of the hall and the lighting design of the passages in the building are unique, simple and stylish.

Serve:
All the hotel staff are very warm and friendly, very patient to provide us with various help. When the car arrived and the car left, someone took the initiative to carry our luggage for us. When we asked for tissues and slippers, they replenished them very quickly. When asking for directions, every employee also answered patiently. Special thanks to Ruby, the hotel relations director, for patiently answering questions and serving us.

Free minibar once during stay (except alcoholic drinks):
There are a lot of things in the small refrigerator, drinks, snacks, soda water, mineral water, and wine are all free! ! :D

It is also very convenient to travel, and the response to a taxi is basically seconds. All in all, it was a great experience, and I will stay here again next time.

The water is clean and the sand is soft and there are no people. This trip One of the most satisfying beaches during my trip to Sanya, it can be regarded as Treasure Beach, the hotel room and breakfast are quite satisfactory, the overall experience is very good, the environment is comfortable and clean, and I will choose a hotel in the future when I go to Sanya.

I know a Treasure Hotel, not many people, very comfortable, hygienic and clean, I feel at ease staying with children, staying for two nights in a row, the indoor park and water park for children are very good, freeing parents' hands, and there are toilets for children It's so cute and clean. Even the kids don't want to leave. I will recommend my friends. Every time I post on Moments, they ask me for the name of the hotel. Like it 👍🏻

There are many angles to take pictures of the sea and other scenery and buildings of Haitang Bay. On one side, the Ferris wheel is very close. The hotel is bright at night The lights are also beautiful, and the lighting design is very advanced. You can stay in the hotel for a whole day, which is very comfortable.
The room is really new, and there is a free minibar. There is a small swimming pool on the balcony, which is perfect for children to play, but adults can only take pictures.
The overall service of the hotel is also very good. Ms. Ruby at the front desk also helped to upgrade the room type and added breakfast, thank you very much! ! !
There are also quite a variety of breakfasts. After eating a little, you should eat some fruit. The fruits in Sanya are really delicious. Mangoes are blown away!
The only downside is that the hotel does not have a private beach. There is a road across the beach to the beach. The distance is not bad, but there are no facilities near the beach. Basically, you just walk over and take a look and then come back. If you go to the beach, you should go to Houhai or other beaches. . On the way to the beach, there is a large open-air children's playground, with slides and swings. I feel that children will be very happy to come!
Anyway, it is really recommended, if you want to relax in the hotel, or go to scenic spots during the day, it is still recommended! !

Travel photography I used the travel photography included in the order report, the service is very good, I took photos in the hotel and at the beach, and the photographer asked us how to pose. 👍

Simple design, no impetuous or flashy.
The landscape and green plants in the lobby make people feel the charm of nature and the flowing water.

Service: The service at the front desk of the hotel is very fast, and they are very patient in answering questions. The little brother at the door is also very enthusiastic and makes people feel at home.
When you meet the staff in the corridor, you will greet them politely.
The breakfast is rich and delicious, and the waiters and chefs will help.

Facilities: Although the room is not big, it has a good layout. I booked a room with a pool, and the privacy is a bit poor. At night, you can see Haichang's Ferris wheel🎡. Wet and dry are separated, and the sofa is also very comfortable.

The TV is new, it can cast a screen, and the sound effect is also good.

Health: very clean.

Overall, I like this place very much, and I will choose this place next time I come to Haitang Bay.

It is also very close to Linwang Night Market.

Hygiene: ￼Hygiene looks pretty good, but what is a bit tangled is that sometimes when the room cleaners help to clean up the garbage, they seem to be hands without gloves. ￼Then I didn’t see the water to wash my hands, and I took a new towel or these hands... I asked her and she said that they had been disinfected. I didn't know what the specific process should be. I chose to trust her at the time.

Environment: ￼The sea view room is very good, one side is the sea view, and when you go out, you can see the scenery of different stages of the mountain view, each with its own beauty￼. The breakfast buffet is very rich. This is very good and you can come back to eat after taking the children out to play.

Service: Basically all requested room service will respond, ￼For example, take the luggage in the lobby to the guest room... ￼When people come and go in the parking area, they will help with luggage￼. The service was excellent.

msg:At that time, I saw that there was an event, and it was a new opening under Marriott, so I made a decisive reservation! I have to say that the design of the hotel is very good, but the overall service and catering still need to be improved. I booked a deluxe sea view room. The hotel is a bit far from the sea, so I can almost see the sea level. I went to the beach to search for a long time before I found a messy path. It took more than ten minutes to walk there. There was some garbage on the beach. It felt like no one was looking after it. Especially when it was dark, the way back was hard to find. I hope this aspect of the hotel It can be improved, after all, everyone still wants to go to the beach to have fun. The variety of breakfast is indeed a bit single, obviously not as good as the breakfast in five or six hundred hotels. The set meal comes with a dinner at a fishing restaurant, as shown in the picture below, which does not match the quality of the hotel. The kids were overjoyed when the minibar was turned on, but it turned out to be a charge. Our welcome fruit was not delivered until we left, and we called to remind us in the middle. The location of the hotel is very close to the duty-free shop and Wuzhizhou Island. If you want to bring a baby to the hotel, it is a good choice.

The wood-colored furniture in the room makes good use of rattan and wood, which is beautiful. The layout is ingenious and easy to use. The garden is very beautiful, clean and quiet. I still want to live next time.

The kids had a great time🥳Recommend parents and children to stay here! The most important thing is to comment on Ruby, the lady at the front desk. She is beautiful and kind. She saw me holding my baby and it was the first time I stayed in this hotel. She immediately upgraded me to the best suite. The room type and location are really the best.

The greening is particularly good, with valley gardens, swimming pools, suspension bridges, waterfalls, and various plants, like a tropical forest. There are many places in the hotel where you can sit and rest, which is very suitable for the elderly. There are so many recreational facilities in the children's swimming pool, children can be very happy when they come. Breakfast and dinner are also very delicious, and the quality of the dishes is particularly high. You can taste a variety of local delicacies without leaving home. If you live here, you don’t need to go to other scenic spots. You can spend several days in the hotel with your family. The first-line sea view room in Haitang Bay, compared with the surrounding luxury hotels, this one is simply the king of cost performance

msg:First of all, I have to name Ctrip. I booked the room very early, very early, and I am also a Marriott Platinum member. I arrived at the store at 9:00 p.m. on the night of check-in. I temporarily arranged a room with the farthest and worst view in Figure 1, which is exclusive to Ctrip. Room! Ctrip, you don’t have the ability to let the hotel lock the room in advance, so please don’t do e-commerce, don’t engage in any membership, and don’t charge membership fees. If this kind of bad view room type is locked in advance, it means that Ctrip is exclusive. Rooms do exist in some hotels! Personal objective and truth-seeking evaluation: 1. The hotel is new, and it is also considered grand. The decoration style is fast and business-style with some green plants, the only point that is not bad! 2. Get out of the car and hand over your luggage to the concierge. The concierge gave you a luggage tag. After you checked in, you took the tag to pick up your luggage. You did pick up your luggage after you checked in, and then you dragged it back to your room. Seeing the concierge delivering luggage to other people, I really don't know who is eligible to be sent luggage to the room at this hotel. 2. Cleanliness and sanitation can be seen in Figure 345. There is a lot of dust and hair in such an obvious place, and other hygiene conditions can be imagined. Wearing a hotel mop can leave black shoe prints in the room. 3. The location of the hotel is not close to the sea. I knew this in advance, but I didn't expect it to be so far away. 4. There is a construction site next to the hotel. Picture 1 is the landscape that can impress your eyes. This construction site may exist for a long time, so other guests please be careful. Don’t be tricked like me. Communicate with Ctrip and the hotel in advance. You can't look at the sea, you can't look at the garden, and it's better to have a room that looks at the road than all the rooms on this side that look at the construction site. 5. Some of the design of the room is really bloody. The sliding door in Figure 6 is when you are washing, and another person wants to get things from the locker, it will not work. When someone uses the locker, another One has to use the sink as well. 6. The service is even more frightening. The first feeling is that they are short of people. I saw very few service personnel during the check-in period. The second is that the service awareness is very lacking. I feel confused. From check-in to check-out, I have been in contact with all the work Personnel, did not have to take the initiative to say hello, and did not have to use polite language during the communication process. My personal conclusion is that it is a new hotel, which needs improvement and efforts in all aspects, but I personally will block this hotel and never stay again, because I am afraid of a hotel where hygiene can be compromised, and I feel that guests here lack the minimum respect . In addition, I would like to complain about the 4th floor upstairs of 267. Did you know that there is a bubble pool downstairs? First spit out a mouthful of phlegm, and then throw an unextinguished cigarette butt down. You can’t see it on the balcony table of the room. ashtray? Or earn more money, no one in the eyes, only to see the same kind as you!

After all, the sea in Haitang Bay is just a decoration. The waves are big and violent, so you can’t get too close to the sea! The front desk of the hotel has the worst attitude of all five-star resort hotels I have encountered. He is expressionless throughout the whole process. If the customer says a word, he must push back, or he will not be able to show the advantages of Marriott! When checking in, two groups of guests had disputes with the front desk. One of them, the receptionist at the front desk, was able to tell a child a fraud! The child's father arrived and scolded, and the front desk immediately became honest! The concierge staff are very lazy, watching the guests pick up their luggage, they will not take the initiative to help! Except for the reception staff at the front desk and the bad reviews from the concierge staff, all the other staff I met were excellent, polite, smiling, and answered questions! Wondering why there is such a big gap in depar**ent personnel!
The hotel is very new. To be honest, I really like the style. It can be seen that the design is top-notch, and the functional areas are outstanding. The outdoor children's play area is one of the most outstanding hotels in Sanya! There are also plenty of parent-child activities!
I booked three rooms, one of which is a heated swimming pool room, which is completely a pit, see the picture!

The room facilities are also very new, the design of the bathroom is quite special, half of it is on the balcony, and you can see the outside through the window

msg:Overall satisfied!
The hardware is first-class, proper five-star, and I personally feel that it is no different from Capella and Edison. It has a grand lobby and exquisite details. The golden brushed gates have a strong texture. The hotel can see that it is a big price, and at the same time, it is built with attention to details. It is much better than the Marriott where I am living now!
The whole hotel is full of chairs where you can sit and lie down, and you can bask in the sun all day without stress. Whether you are having breakfast or afternoon tea, or just strolling around, this design is very good. The back garden is amazing.
Besides the service, I saw many people saying that the service was not good, so I was a little worried. But the actual service is very good! There was noise in the room on the first night, and the maintenance guy came to the door quickly. Although it didn't solve it, the front desk manager trotted over and sent the key cards of other rooms. Any needs and questions later can be communicated very well. Health is also no problem.

In Sanya, it is easy to be misunderstood as a constant temperature swimming pool, and the temperature of this pool is only in the 20s, which is similar to the temperature of the swimming pool. The water in the pool is a bit dirty, and there is a big pool of stains beside the pool. , because it is a set meal, there is a dinner included in the content. When we went there, there was no dinner in the restaurant on Thursday. Fortunately, we stayed the next day, otherwise there would be no dinner...

Only when I arrived did I realize that it was owned by Marriott, which must produce high-quality goods. Opening the blind box revealed a surprise.
I chose a double room because I was traveling with my best friend
The lady at the front desk, Ruby, was very patient and helped us check in. Since we arrived too late, the location of the room is very good and you can see the Ferris wheel, so romantic hahaha! As soon as you enter the room, there is a faint woody smell. I can't wait to sit on the bed. I like it. The softness and hardness are moderate. The bath accessories are my favorite smell. Go try it! It is said to be a parent-child hotel. I saw a lot of recreational facilities and swimming pools.
I want to see the following video of the room!

msg:This hotel is quite new, the room facilities are okay, the service is a mess. If its hardware facilities can barely reach five stars, then the service is not as good as a guest house. Our two families traveled together with our children and booked two hotels with sea view suites. The hotel actually separated our rooms When arranging two buildings, you need to know that it takes about 10 minutes to walk from building a to building b. Negotiate with the front desk and say that there is no room of the same type in the same building. OK. After entering room 599 in building b, the sea view suite in the photo is like this. I want to ask Where is the sea view? There are two prices for sea view suites in your hotel. I have already booked the most expensive sea view room. You just let me see this? At this time, I called the front desk, and the front desk said that they could help me move to Building B 699, which is the upper floor of the same building. Then when I just checked in, why did you say that there are no two rooms in the same building? Anyway, the service of this hotel is really the worst place I have ever stayed in Sanya! none of them!

It is a newly opened hotel in the second half of 2022 (I thought the new one would be stable, sure enough haha), this hotel is also owned by Marriott, and the toiletries in the room are the same as Sheraton (the smell is very good!! A set with warm oak fragrance, I also went to a certain treasure to search for the same style 😂) The facilities are very new, and the overall design is mainly made of rattan wood and green. It is very fresh and relaxing. I personally really like it! And all the service staff in the hotel are very proactive and enthusiastic, especially thanks to Ruby at the front desk for patiently answering various questions~ All in all, the stay is very comfortable, not far from the beach of Haitang Bay, very cost-effective, highly recommended! !

Advantages: 1. The environment is very new and quieter
           2 breakfast quality is very good
           3 The dinner buffet is very cost-effective, and the desserts are delicious
           4 Children's facilities are very complete, including full indoor, semi indoor, and outdoor beach and water park
 Disadvantages: 1 Self-service laundry room There are too few washing machines, only 2 washing machines and 1 drying machine. I have been queuing up all the time, and I am still doing laundry at 12 o'clock in the middle of the night. Hope to add
            2 The corners of the stairs on each floor are a bit dangerous, and children can easily hit their heads
          3 For swimming pools with constant temperature, bath towels still need to be added
          4 The outdoor constant temperature pool is not considered a hot spring pool. The temperature is not high and the water is not clean. It may be because of the outdoors that it is not very clean.

(Very dissatisfied with the restaurant service brother)
I really don't like the local waiters in the restaurant
The little brother who cuts the sashimi, every day with emotions against customers, so annoying
A customer said that it would be good to put the sliced fish on the customer's plate!
He directly said no! He also told the previous guests that we are separating raw from cooked! ! ! I took an empty plate and I said put it here! He also said no! ****! Your plate is OK! None of ours will work!

There is a thin and tall lady at the front desk who is very nice, and changed our room that was not so related to the sea view to a location near the bay. In addition, the service of food delivery and replenishment of consumables is very timely. The standard of the hotel's dinner is average. It's not far from the airport, more than half an hour, and ten minutes from the duty-free shop. This price is acceptable without a beach during the off-peak season of the Spring Festival. Small two thousand. After all, it was about 4,000 at the same time.

After tossing for almost half an hour, I finally got it done. I called various government hotlines the day before but couldn't solve it. I really appreciate their patience and help!
Overall, the hotel is worth recommending, and we will come again

msg:I have been to Sanya many times, and this is the first time I stayed at this hotel. this is amazing! 1. In terms of service attitude, the service attitude of the staff is very good. As soon as we came in, Kebi at the front desk received us. It was already past ten o'clock in the evening, but we were still full of enthusiasm. Other staff also took our luggage and explained a lot. and that night in the early hours of the morning
We didn't understand the air conditioner in the room after four o'clock, so we called the front desk, and the staff immediately helped us adjust it.
2. In terms of the environment, the overall style is modern, and it is the cleanest hotel I have stayed in these days. It is especially suitable for cleanliness like me! The room is clean and bright, there are many lighting options to choose from, and the outdoor facilities are comprehensive and large. Since I came back late these days, I didn't play too much outdoors, so I will come to play again next time I have a chance!
3. In terms of diet, there are welcome fruits for two consecutive days, and mini
There are iced drinks and snacks at the bar, and takeaways can also be delivered to the hotel lobby, which is very convenient!
4. In terms of geographical location, it is located in Haitang Bay. The location is easy to find. It is very close to the duty-free shops. The most important thing is that there is an underground parking lot! ! !
It often rains here in Sanya. Other good hotels can only park their cars in the garden and walk into the lobby in the rain. This hotel has completely solved this problem, so happy!
All in all, it was a perfect experience, highly recommended, and I will stay here for a few days next time I come to Sanya~

Although it is not facing the sea, the sea view room can still clearly see Wuzhizhou Island in the distance. There are not many varieties of breakfast in the hotel, and it is more Western-style, but the taste is quite good. If you don’t prefer being close to the coast and being close to duty-free shops, Taikang House is still a very good choice, the price is affordable and the experience is very good! In addition, I would like to thank Xiaoke at the front desk for his warm reception.

Poor service: I lived in countless Marriott brands, asked if Marriott Platinum can be upgraded, he said that booking from Ctrip is not possible, and there are no points, haha
It doesn’t feel like a luxury hotel design. This project is designed in a nursing home. The huge and simple corridors already feel old. They are not designed by Marriott. After the decoration, they are pasted with Marriott’s soft brand. The rooms are all wood and still smell of formaldehyde. The sanitation is very poor , the drawer still has the paper drawn by the previous guest, the hair tie of the previous guest left in the gap of the sofa,
First of all, I would like to thank Ctrip for coordinating. The original package was for two days, but I returned it for one day and decided to change it to Wenli Sofitel. In fact, Haitang Bay is the same price, and there are many hotels with better first-line locations, such as Mangrove Forest...any one of them is better than him. Much better, there are requirements for location and design to avoid lightning

I suddenly found that a Kangtai Home Resort Hotel has just opened and has a special opening price. I was a little hesitant and worried about the newly opened hotel. Is there any smell in the room or the service is not in place? I drove to the hotel that night and saw the bright lights of the hotel from a distance. As soon as I entered the simple and a**ospheric hotel lobby, it seemed that Aman Japan liked it too much. The faint wooden perfume smell at the hotel front desk and the welcome drink made Our family is completely relaxed, the standard resort five-star configuration must be dropped, the manager at the front desk, Jason, is very good. I heard that it was our first time to experience the new hotel. quite satisfied. Entering the room The room is the Japanese-style light luxury style that our family prefers. A lot of wooden decoration is used, but it is not complicated. In particular, there is basically no taste of new hotel decoration. The shower water of the international brand of sanitary ware is very large. The bathtub is very good, and the room has a sea view. The whole family is satisfied. In particular, the hotel has three children's swimming pools with super-long slides, which are very suitable for taking children. In addition, there is a larger adult swimming pool in a five-star hotel I stayed in Sanya. It is very comfortable to take pictures and can make a big picture. The key is Sanya There should be a lot of people in the hotel, but our whole family swims in an afternoon, only our family 😜😜😜. After that, we stayed for two more days and a total of three nights. The new five-star hotel in Haitang Bay, which is very good, is highly recommended to everyone.

Ruby, the guest specialist, called me in advance to understand my needs one day before check-in, and was very considerate. I moved here from the Yalong Bay Marriott. My husband said that except for the lack of a private beach, everything else is perfect and the price/performance ratio is too high. Except that the guests waited for a while when they checked in, everything else was really satisfactory. The whole hotel exudes a woody aroma and feels very comfortable.
Next time I come to Sanya, I will definitely consider staying in a hotel.

When I go out for vacation, I will be angry first! By the way, the sofa waiting to rest in the lobby is still wet, so don't deal with it! There is really no place to wait. There are always rubbish piled up by guests in the corridor of the room and they are not cleaned up in time! Recruit a lot of small flying insects.

There is also a minibar in the room, since there are still leftover Cokes left by the previous guests! There are a lot of green plants in the public area of the hotel. They are really ugly, and they look like they are completely collapsed! I hope the green plants in every corner of the hotel are still alive! There is also the fact that since each floor of the corridor needs to display artworks, I hope to display some quality and a little richer! The breakfast is indeed a bit too simple. The juices that are not freshly squeezed are all boxed juice drinks. There are too few varieties and the quality is really not good. However, I would like to commend the lifeguards in the adult pool for their good attitude!

The location of the hotel is very close to Atlantis. We go to the water world, which is very convenient!

The reason is that I did not swipe less during check-in, which is too amateur. 3 After dinner, I took a walk in front of the lobby on the first floor. The security comrade came forward and asked to wear a mask. Immediately, the feeling of People's Square flooded into my heart. 4 The worst thing happened at night. The air conditioner in the room was broken. I called the service staff. I felt woken up by me. Her first reaction when yawning was to ask the workers to come. It was almost 12 in the morning. Just fix it. , Because the worker's master was full of repairs immediately, they would not change the room, but in the end, due to the failure of the accessories, the workers had to evacuate. It was already 12 o'clock in the middle of the night, and when I called the service staff to ask for a room change, no one answered. I know I've stepped on a deep pit today, but I'm too sleepy and I don't want to toss any more. In the morning, I informed Ctrip customer service again, and finally a so-called female manager called. She seemed very insincere, so I asked her to repeat what happened yesterday, but she didn't know about the air conditioning incident at all. You must know that this is a newly opened hotel, and the communication with Ctrip is so sloppy. Of course, the hotel finally sent a "Boban" manager. He was really sincere. After understanding the situation, he knew that the hotel was in the wrong, so he bought an air-conditioned room for me to rest for a long time, and gave me a room coupon to apologize. . At this moment, I'm not satisfied with the hotel's handling, but I just don't want to add to this holiday. It's okay to think about it. Although the manager of "Boban" expressed his willingness to have lunch together, I haven't stayed at this hotel for a while. I was in a mood, so I took the time to let Ctrip confirm the early check-in of the next hotel. After all, it is the purpose of going out to enjoy a normal vacation. (Low score because the room service of the newly opened hotel is so sloppy, I hope they don't manage the new store in an old-fashioned way. But excluding Chinese and Western restaurants, they are enough for five-star performance)

It’s just a chance to experience the environment of the new hotel. The room with Japanese-style wooden furniture is very modern and simple. Facing the sea, I feel very relaxed. The hotel also has a lot of entertainment facilities. It’s very convenient to walk out of the hotel lobby and the seaside is only a few hundred meters away. If you are hungry, you can also order the room service. If you are too lazy to go downstairs like me, you can quietly sleep in your room and dream in a daze. Finally, you have to show respect to Mr. Leo at the front desk. We arrived at the hotel very late on the first day , There is a lot of luggage, please help me to send it to the room, the arranged room is also very good, and Ms. Libby at the front desk is also very friendly, thank you!

We arrived at almost 12 o'clock, the front desk said that the room should be cleaned first, let us wait for a while, and we waited for half an hour before we got the key card of one room, and the other room was not cleaned well, so we waited like this For nearly an hour, I really couldn't wait, so I went to have lunch first. When I came back, I got the key card of another room. When I went in, I found that the potted plants next to my swimming pool were all down. In addition, the attitude and level of the service staff are unprofessional. From check-in to consultation on nucleic acid matters on the day, many staff members gave me answers like "uh, I don't know about this" and "I can't do anything about it". I suggest management The upper management strengthens the training of employees, even if they encounter something they don’t know, they try to consult their superiors instead of giving such negative feedback to customers, which makes people feel very bad.

At the same time, the concierge where takeaway is placed is super far from the room. In addition, the elevator of the hotel puts a BGM similar to a horror movie with a red light of death. As a result, neither my friend nor I dared to take takeout.
In the end, what I can't understand the most is that there is a body odor at the front desk of check-in. It's more or less outrageous.

There is a charging pile marked, but it is not actually enabled, so it is not charged at night. The heated swimming pool is just a swimming pool, not a hot spring pool. The water is cooler and slightly warmer. It feels like it won't be at the current price in a few months.

My stomach hurts when renewing the room. Please hurry up to renew the room. The front desk asked me how do you want to renew the fee? Fortunately, the colleague next to me was flexible.

房間很新，還有泡池，酒店設計感十足，服務也比索菲特高一個檔次。管家小徐提前兩天就加了微信，各種需求都光速回復，這樣的服務甩其他酒店一路。酒店綠化，小童玩樂設施齊全。早餐下午茶中餐都吃了，完爆索菲特和三亞灣鉑爾曼。
唯一缺陷不靠海，建議酒店考慮挖個地下通道直通海灘。

酒店電話尾號1111的建議取消。衹能接電話，從不解決問題，也從不反饋。前台呆板且遇事躲事。

晚上的入夜儀式也很棒，有歌手、舞者表演等。酒店裡還有三個泳池、小童樂園、山谷花園供客人蔘觀遊玩，尤其是到了晚上，環境幽靜，又因為酒店的綠植豐富，讓人感覺空氣格外好，整體住的都很滿意。

酒店為小朋友準備的玩樂區域有四五個，這點特別好，特別適合親子，帶娃可以來體驗一下，小朋友應該很喜歡，房間的温泉池低幼小朋友一玩就幾個小時，真不錯！

1、入住時前台Ruby非常關心和理解我們的遭遇，本來我們的房間是沒有早餐的，送了我們兩天的早餐，感謝Ruby！
2、説一個細節：在辦理入住時，我抬手擦了一下頭上的汗，Ruby第一時間遞上紙巾，細節決定成敗，讓我十分暖心！
3、泳池的水也很乾凈，房間也很整潔和乾淨
下次來三亞還會選擇泰康！

酒店早餐也不錯，西餐比較多。咖啡也不錯的。
Ruby服務很貼心。
這個酒店唯一有點缺陷就是地下停車場，設計不合理。

msg:本次出行是對保險公司投資的酒店好奇而選擇入住。酒店大堂很出片，大堂外觀值得尋味。房間美觀有出彩的表現，也有不盡如人意的設計。感覺和泰康這家保險公司給人的感覺一樣，場景設計很引人入勝，但用起來總有很多詬病的地方。能看到很多美和外觀特別設計過的地方，但也有很多實用性考量不足的地方。看完出片的大堂，走向房間通道，美感的落差迅速降臨，通道感覺像酒店內部辦公通道；房間洗手間地面排水非常不暢，地面傾斜角度這種基本問題也沒做好；馬桶和洗浴雖然完全分離，但共同點是沒有通風設計，當大作業以後，氣味便完全留在裏面，而如果使用浴缸時間稍長，可能會悶暈在裏面。有自助洗衣服務為長時間旅行的人解決不少問題；床鋪大小定位恰好，值得肯定！

房間空間大，採光好，明亮，設施齊全，前台服務非常好，早餐也很棒，有免費停車場，出行也很方便，非常推薦
攜程預訂還送了雞尾酒，但入夜儀式有點尬且無聊無聊，屬於是套餐湊數的產物。還有贈送的旅拍，雖然在前台登記了説稍後會有人聯繫約時間，但並沒有接到任何關於旅拍的電話以及短訊。
關於酒店位置在海棠灣，離市區有點遠，住這裏建議租車，但離cdf距離較近，購物很方便。

優點：
性價比高
地理位置好，離海灘、免税店和亞特蘭蒂斯都很近
每天都有親子活動，有室內和室外的小童樂園
早餐豐富，西式中式都有
服務很好，有求必應。從下車開始就有小哥拿行李。
缺點：泳池邊上的植物有部分枯死，私隱度較差
不過整體體驗還是很不錯的

特別感謝管家Nick，我們把行李放下來就去玩了，就幫我把行李放回房間，還有預訂了餐廳吃飯，飯菜口味很好，也是當地特色，基本不用出酒店就能滿足所有，是喜歡泡酒店的旅客福音。

整體都不錯，也很高端大氣上檔次。缺點是距離海邊有些遠，不是很方便！另：還有一點就是我們住在7樓，蚊子很多，一家人第一晚可能是累了，睡得較沉，被咬的很慘，特別是小孩臉和腿！

特別表揚的管家小徐，服務細緻入微想的超級周到，特別棒。提三點建議：1、公共區域的温度可以再低一點，可以參考一下太陽灣柏悦；2、小童樂園可以再延遲一點關閉，沒有孩子會這麼早睡覺的，其他酒店都是22店才關閉；3、服務聯動機制可以完善一下，孩子在池邊想喝果汁，問工作人員説必須自己去泳池吧去點，雖然離得近但是對於自己帶個小娃玩的人不太方便，我問有沒有電話點也不行。以上希望完善，祝越來越好。此次入住還是挺満意的。

msg:從來不願意多碼字評論的我必須好好寫下這次的入住體驗了。
入住前一天管家小樂就電話加了微信，溝通過入住需求後主動幫我們升級了海景房，並且給了酒吧的贈飲，當時覺得有些小幸運，好感度一下就提升了不少，尤其是小樂還是在休假時間一直在幫我安排，真的是辛苦了。入住當天小樂也主動聯繫，根據我的需求又給我安排了許多驚喜，真的是覺得房費太低配不上這麼好的服務了。
再説説酒店硬件，2022年建造的新酒店，一切裝修設備都給人舒服的感覺，新能源車也有	充電的地方用起來很方便，暖心的提供寶寶圍欄，帶孩子入住也有安全保障。雖然這兩項我帶父母入住用不到，但能感受到酒店的用心。
房內禁煙也有報警裝置，這讓不愛聞煙味的人住着很舒心（當然陽台也可以給煙民們自由吸煙的空間）這點至少我媽很滿意，我和老爸也自覺的去陽台抽煙，也是不想破壞這麼好的入住環境。
酒店每晚8點30有入夜儀式千萬別錯過，可以給家人或情侶一個小小的儀式感。深夜再去酒吧小酌一杯，吹着海風談談心感受片刻寧靜，掃去城市中快節奏工作帶來的絲絲疲倦。（酒吧贈飲分別有含酒精和不含酒精的共計4款，	味道都在線的）酒店早餐是早6點30到早10點的吧，種類夠豐富，糟粕醋的後安粉很好吃，最後來衹椰子冰激凌很完美。	
總之這才三亞行，還住了蜈支洲的珊瑚酒店和三亞的温德姆酒店，最中意的就是泰康之家
了，舒服的床品，下次一定要多住幾晚，真正	感覺住客有被完全尊重的感覺。能遇到小樂這樣完美的管家是我這次旅遊最大的幸運。

msg:總結:房間總體來説，非常糟糕，本次我們來三亞住過的最差酒店，沒有之一，不推薦攜帶寶寶、長者居住。（可惜評價最低是1分，其實1分都不想給。）
設施：1.酒店房間偏新，還存在很重的裝修味道。（我們是出門前關閉門窗，回來推開門一股濃烈的裝修味道撲面而來）。另，酒店設定了一開陽台推拉門，空調就會暫停，因天氣炎熱晚上需要開空調，故必須一晚上把門窗緊閉，試問一晚上會吸入多少這些有害物質。2.酒店內的小童户外泳池不是恆温泳池，水温偏離涼；也不會提供游泳圈借用服務。
衞生：衞生條件有待提升，剛入住就發現沙發上還遺留頭髮。
環境：環境是最差的一塊，噪音嚴重擾民。我們居住的房間旁邊是一個酒店的施工工地，從早上7點開始施工，完全休息不好。而且，酒店是能忽悠一個算一個，並不會提前告知噪音因素。
服務：前台人員服務偏急，辦理入住缺少耐心，也不會主動告知酒店內地圖和小童項目時刻表，全靠住客自行探索發現。
基於以上，設施、衞生、環境、服務無一讓人滿意，故我們堅持要求提前退房，但前台人員一句我們沒得權限輕鬆甩鍋給攜程，好在攜程工作人員盡心盡力幫我們協調，再次感謝攜程。

首先，特別讚的是服務。之前看評論還有人説服務不太好，實在特別驚喜有沒有。門僮小哥超級熱情，每次打車都主動幫開車門，幫提行李到放門口。前台的Lria小妹特別熱情周到。
其次，餐廳的服務也一級棒，品種豐盛，在一眾五星酒店中能排前列。
再次，乾淨，真的非常非常乾淨，無論是房間還是各項設施。泳池是一整個夏天住過的8家五星酒店中最乾淨的。
還非常安靜，新酒店的空調是老酒店沒法比的。

特別感謝Livia李傲男，在入住前幫我打點一切！

前台可有些差強人意，辦入住的時候，因為房間還沒打掃出來，先辦了登記手續後我們就租車出去玩了。大約五六點回來取房卡的時候，前台小姐姐竟然不知道我定的什麼房，好不容易知道了訊息做好了房卡以為就是個小插曲，結果根本還沒提前準備好，連通房中間的門沒開，找了客房服務也不知道怎麼回事，反問我房間訊息。等了半天客房小哥哥拿鑰匙打開了中間的門，可另一間房的房卡沒給還需要去前台辦理，折騰啊而且效率很低。

衞生：衞生很好，可能是季節的原因，沒有蚊蟲

環境：環境不錯

服務：泳池和小童樂園很好，每天的小童活動很多，上午下午都有本來是要五星的，但是圖一這個保安給我噁心到了。
我帶着老婆阿姨3歲半和7個月的兩個孩子，開着租的車第一天到酒店，阿姨要給嬰兒餵奶，老婆要看着3歲半的孩子，我一個人搬行李，辦入住，大熱天的這個保安一直催我挪車，一句一句的懟着我麻煩您挪車，關鍵是當時門口一輛車都沒有，最有意思的是，向大唐經理投訴居然説管不了，是外包的，之後入住的一週天天看他在酒店晃悠，真給我噁心壞了。
室內空調一直顯示33度，第二天叫了工程部的人來了一直告訴沒問題，態度很生硬，最後打電話問了主管才給修好。
投訴了保安和工程後被告知這兩個部門是外包的。
第三天中午因為記錯房間號被服務生瘋狂敲門，把全家吵醒，當班經理送了一堆冰激凌券。後來大廳了一下這些服務生都是三亞當地某學校的學生，不拿工資的那種。
一共住五天，頭三天天天出問題，後兩天還得看着那個保安溜溜達達的噁心人。這次孩子確實開心，大人就真的很煩，萬豪的管理就這個玩意兒，張嘴就是外包的管不了

衞生差，房間浴巾上有蟲，小孩入住第一天就過敏，在餐廳經理看到小孩紅腫的腿，幫忙協調換了房間，態度挺好，這是唯一值得表揚的一件事。
房間格局奇怪，入住體驗極其差。
離開酒店當天晚上發現卸粧油洗面奶還有孩子T恤落在房間，打電話回去問酒店，催了幾次才回復確實是有，我就住在隔壁酒店，讓幫忙送過來，酒店拒絕，要我們自己去拿或者自費跑跑送。當時已經是晚上十點。
極品到極點！我問她們是不是如果我不打電話過去詢問，丟的東西也就不了了之了。我早上十點退房的，她們打掃房間已經發現遺落的東西，為什麼不打電話給我？

要説缺點的話就是入住辦理較慢，基本不能三點準時入住，有些影響體驗。

    酒店很新，有些許邊邊角角地方小磨損或者一點點裝修完的痕跡無傷大雅。給的房間挑高得有8m，可能會有人覺得空曠，但我們覺得非常不錯，房間號856我會記住，下次過來照着這間定哈哈哈哈（貌似整個酒店這種高挑的房型沒幾間）～
   酒店大門不在沿海的街上，所以出門步行距離海邊走個十來分鐘，穿過小樹林～不過基本出門就是打車，附近吃吃喝喝的也多，打車起步價上下。
    酒店自助餐沒吃過，都是去外面吃的。夜貓子早上起的晚，早飯也是定的外賣，吃這塊我對酒店無權評論，不過倒也沒發過愁😂
    院裏倆泳池一片沙地遊園，小朋友都在遊樂泳池玩耍，個人感覺還不錯。
    退房還蠻順暢的，按金也當場退了，不過到了傍晚入住亞龍灣酒店時説還沒退身份證，這邊酒店前台打過去電話，報了房號3分鐘就OK了，算是一個小插曲。不記得辦理入住的小姐姐名字，但必須給她點贊，下次入住還會選這家，小姐姐功勞能佔7成！（不過會直接定升級後的套房，差價無所謂關鍵房間是真喜歡！）

❌The room is still decorated
❌The air conditioner was blowing directly at the head of the bed, and I hardly fell asleep on the first night. I wonder if it is a wellness hotel
❌The swimming pool room is a pit. Before booking the hotel, I called and asked that the pool in the room was 1.1 meters. When I got to the room, I found that it was only 0.6, and it was a very small pool. It had nothing to do with the pool. It was about 1 meter * 2 meters.
❌Breakfast was very, very, very poor, even with more than three stars. I ate a seafood barbecue buffet in time for the rain, and the seafood barbecue only had grilled oysters🦪
❌The advertised children's playground seems to be very new and large, but in fact there are no children playing, not because it is small, but because the facilities are not good, and all the slides can't slide! ! What is it called a slide if it is not slippery? So don't book here if you are going to the children's playground.
Won't go again and won't recommend to friends!

🔹總結一下，緊湊型現代酒店，房間很小，我定了兩種房，貴的有個池子，便宜的在高樓層，有個游泳池的景色，沒其他了、
🔹性價比不高，海棠灣還是推薦一線沙灘酒店！

唯一不太滿意的是，晚上的海鮮自助餐廳裏，烤生蠔的師傅給生蠔像施捨一樣，當時還有一起排隊的説“這感覺自己像要飯的”後來第二次去吃的時候，我就直接跳過生蠔攤位，索性不吃了。生蠔在海南又不貴，而且排隊人也就四五個，知道生蠔烤起來慢就應該多烤幾個，而不是一邊讓人排隊一邊又扣扣搜搜的就給三五個，這個實在很敗五星酒店餐廳的水準。

2、早餐，人比較多，酒店在餐廳門口排隊，有領位帶進去（這個服務挺好其實），但是由於領位也不知道哪桌子，所以基本就是隨意帶，我們三個人讓我們坐雙人桌就餐。
3、酒店有自助晚餐，種類不是很多。
4、套餐送歡迎水果，如果不問，根本沒人送。

服務態度有點糟心，第一次給的房間不太滿意，打電話非説沒有房可以換了（説要換衹有臨隔壁工地的），才下午3點多哦，還是端午假期前一天，真不信那麼早直接住滿了。
發飆後就給換了。

去沙灘要穿過樹林，不想再有第二次😂
海棠灣南邊，市政府為什麼不能修幾條人行小步道從海邊樹林中穿過，通往沙灘呢？是怕海棠灣北邊的酒店掉價嗎？

msg:服務
到海南的前兩天住的海棠灣萬豪，所以覺得服務還是有點點下降的，入住沒有主動升級房型，也沒有主動給小朋友旅行洗漱套裝（因為在萬豪的沒用完我也沒要了）
床圍也是提醒後給的。

小童樂園雖然不大，工作人員倒挺熱情的。

酒店泳池
有三個小童泳池連在一起，下午四五點就基本沒太陽了，還有一個成人泳池，也沒有很深1.2好像。隔壁在裝修有點吵。

海邊
需要走7-8分鐘，從酒店大門出去然後過馬路，再走一段樹林小路，真的是野路的那種。我們去的時候有點下雨，除了我們一家三口衹有一個人，真的有一種包場的感覺。

食
早餐和萬豪我覺得差不多，種類豐富。就是沙發比較不舒服。晚餐的自助也吃了，覺得一般般吧，有歌手駐場挺有氛圍。佛跳牆得讓服務人員給你拿。
漁鮮也吃了，推薦，挺不錯的，我們吃的是訂酒店送的套餐，加小朋友有點不夠吃，所以多點了一份蝦🦐挺好的。小朋友幾乎把蝦全部吃了。

小童樂園
室內的就比較小了。小朋友衹能玩一會兒
有一個半室外的（就是沒有空調，有頂沒有牆）有蹦蹦床和滑梯，滑梯不太適合2歲左右的。所以我們沒玩。

酒店設施
裝修新的，極簡。衞浴Toto值得一提的是浴缸不錯。

3.離店後沒給我辦退住，導致我下一家酒店入住不了

入住前一天賓客關係小愛就電話加了微信，根據我的需求盡心盡力在幫我們 ，真的是覺得房費太低配不上這麼好的服務了。
再説説酒店硬件，2022年建造的新酒店，一切裝修設備都給人舒服的感覺，新能源車也有	充電的地方用起來很方便，暖心的提供寶寶圍欄，帶孩子入住也有安全保障。
房內禁煙也有報警裝置，這讓不愛聞煙味的人住着很舒心（當然陽台也可以給煙民們自由吸煙的空間）
酒店每晚8點30有入夜儀式千萬別錯過，可以給家人或情侶一個小小的儀式感。深夜再去酒吧小酌一杯，吹着海風談談心感受片刻寧靜，掃去城市中快節奏工作帶來的絲絲疲倦。（酒吧贈飲分別有含酒精和不含酒精的共計4款，	味道都在線的）酒店早餐是早6點30到早10點的吧，種類夠豐富，糟粕醋的後安粉很好吃，最後來衹椰子冰激凌很完美。	
總之這才三亞行，最中意的就是泰康之家
了，舒服的床品，下次一定要多住幾晚，真正	感覺住客有被完全尊重的感覺。能遇到小愛是我這次旅遊最大的幸運。

msg:性價比：
第一次來海棠灣，選擇泰康之家臻品之選酒店，和工作人員聊天得知酒店為泰康投資，委託萬豪運營的酒店。錯過十一假期，十月初預訂的酒店價格599元，目前的價格最便宜的房型已經漲到800➕，而且酒店前台Ruby小姐姐幫忙升級了視野比較好的8層房間，能看到蜈支洲島和大海哦[偷笑]

房間設施：
雖然是雙床房，最多可以住三個人的，衞生間，洗手枱，浴室都是分開的，極簡原木風，陽台配有晾衣架，雙人沙發和小茶几。如果有辦公需求也Ok，房間內配有一個簡單工作台，基礎辦公需求沒問題[強] 房間內的洗護用品都是木質香味很好聞，衹是房間潮氣明顯，建議加強除濕。

游泳池：
錯峯出行才是休假，每天去泳池游泳基本沒什麼人，救生員恨不得比游泳人還多[偷笑]泳池長60米寬20米深1.3米，水温合適，提供浴巾，帶小朋友的也不用擔心，除了成人泳池還有小童泳池水深0.6米，可以玩兒沖浪板哦[耶] 還有一個更淺的小童水上滑梯之類的供小朋友玩耍。因為幾乎沒有小朋友，兩個成年人去玩也開心的像個孩子[愉快]

健身房：
有單獨的健身房，空間不大，幾台跑步機，幾台橢圓儀，啞鈴等健身器材，基礎運動也ok的。[鼓掌]

位置交通：
酒店位置距海邊有點距離，如果希望出門就是海灘那可以不用選擇這個酒店，如果不是很在意距離，選擇這裏沒有問題，幾公里就到距離蜈支洲島啦[憨笑]

早餐：
早餐品類比較豐富，中式主要粥，各類麪，豆腐腦油條豆漿等，酸奶牛奶麪包水果種類選擇很多，總有一款你喜歡，進去馬上有服務人員領位，現切的水果和一些甜品偶爾有廚師會送過來每個桌位[調皮]

泰康的養老社區遍佈全國，海南的在海口，不過酒店有個泰康養老社區的體驗店，感興趣的話可以順便了解一下哦[悠閑]

衞生：小童區電梯下來每天都是股濃重的尿騷味，衞生間更是乾濕分離到家了，馬桶旁連沖水槍都沒有，請問淋浴離那麼遠。喜歡消毒過再用衞生間的人，怎麼清洗？設計不考慮嗎？
環境：很小很差，私人海灘沒有，洗衣房很遠，晚上過去都害怕

服務：剛開業人多，想必大家都是為了攜程套餐，什麼餐加旅拍，旅拍是5張後一張70元，還是電子版。攝影師也很沒耐心。照完你要推銷不買就會白眼。誰出來沒帶手機還是相機呢？掛個萬豪旗下就想法圈錢嗎？住兩天按金就1000，退房後按金3天沒回來，打電話給銀行，酒店一直沒取消凍結。跑到酒店讓解除，前台讓我們等了半個小時終於解封了。業務沒有培訓過嗎？讓我們配合他試來試去。如果不跑過去，按金就一直不退客人了嗎？最後業務低下的前台男經理，説了一句：是銀行的問題。操作半個小時是銀行不會操作？這種服務態度和迴路我們也不敢恭維。人臉識別也是，一直不給退出來，入住別的酒店又給這家泰康打電話，站別家退了半個小時才辦了入住。反正就是爛透了，大家不要圖新開就買套餐。究竟多小多設計不合理，大家可以提前去看看再訂，別回頭扣了大家錢左一次右一次不給退。怪不得頭天辦入住，電梯遇到個女的就一直和他老公説，我要投訴他，你別攔着，我們不差幾百。讓他退款。果不其然的爛，再也不會去了。勸這家酒店做好服務再接客吧！

2.下午茶根本沒按套餐裏面的菜單來上，而且很甜很膩。套餐裏送的任何東西都很敷衍。CDF中免優惠券基本都用不了，海昌不夜城根本就不需要門票，一張票衹能玩某個項目（旋轉木馬或者什麼忘記了）。
3.沙灘就不要想了，去沙灘需要到海棠公園。
住過三亞幾個豪華酒店，泰康是最沒有歸屬感的酒店。
