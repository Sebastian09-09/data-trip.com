msg:The May Day holiday was particularly chaotic. I don't accept the argument that there were too many people and the operation capacity was insufficient. We paid a higher room rate than usual, but the service was still inadequate. Why should we consumers tolerate and understand the argument that there were too many people and the service was inadequate? First of all, the hotel is upgrading the fountain pool. During the May Day holiday, the noise was unbearable. It was the sound of foundation work, which was very loud. They started working on the foundation at 8 a.m. and made all kinds of heavy noises, which was very annoying. Let's not talk about whether they can create noise problems during the May Day holiday. The hotel collected money, but didn't consider the customers at all. They didn't inform us of the noise problem before we checked in. It was so annoying. There was a rhythmic heavy noise...all kinds of welding and sawing sounds, which ruined our good vacation. We called the front desk and solved it on the first day. It was probably 5 p.m. at that time, so we didn't do it. We started working on it at 8 a.m. the next day and asked the hotel to make adjustments. The hotel didn't care. There was still noise. We changed rooms and asked them to move to a room far away from the noise. When we got to the room, we found that it was closer to the noise source, just upstairs from the construction site, and the noise was even louder. Later we changed to another room, and finally we couldn't hear it anymore. But the customers in the entire building No. 2 were still enduring the noise. The hotel cooperated with the arrival of the Dalian tourist season in this way, and sent a message to outsiders. Local customers should avoid thunder~
Secondly, there are no children's toiletries and bathrobes in the whole hotel. When asked by the front desk, there are only slippers. They said that our room is for three adults. We booked a courtyard family room. No matter what room it is, does it have anything to do with my need for children's toiletries? Later, the front desk said impatiently that there are no children's toiletries, only slippers. The courtyard family room has no refrigerator. Later, a very dirty one was moved in. There are only two patio umbrellas, which are random. Hehehe, the hotel also has no tea bags, coffee bags, etc. There are no mugs. The mouthwash cup is wet when you check in, not dry. I don't know if it has not been changed at all. The hand soap is also not packaged. It has not been changed at all. Later, the room we changed to, the soap has plastic packaging, and the nozzle cannot be adjusted... It is very inconvenient to use~
Secondly, we changed to room 1506... There are no towels and hand towels~
The children's playground charges an additional 30 yuan. There are very few things. There is no takeaway food around the hotel. You can only eat at the hotel. It is very inconvenient. I know the attitude of the hotel. The noise problem. I contacted Ctrip the next day. Ctrip said that the hotel could not give us a discount for booking (the child did not leave and had to stay for one day). But Ctrip refunded us 390 in cash and apologized. The hotel did not apologize at all. By the way, the hotel said that they would apply for a price of 800 for renewal. Then I went to the official website and saw that it was only 798. It's a big deal that you applied for 800. Everyone on the official website buys 798. It shows the quality of the hotel staff and their attitude towards guests. If I were a foreign tourist, Dalian would be blacklisted.

msg:I went to the nearby Dalian Dongquan Holiday Hotel during my business trip. It was early spring, the ice and snow had melted, and the trees had not turned green yet. The surrounding scenery was naturally a little less beautiful, but in another month, it should be full of flowers and grass. Xiaotieshan Forest Park is near the hotel. The room facilities are complete and very clean. The main thing is that the hot spring is very good, the water quality is excellent, the indoor space is large, the facilities are complete, and there is a children's water play area, which is suitable for parent-child activities. The service in the restaurant is good, you can order dishes, the surrounding transportation is inconvenient, and there are no other restaurants. You can solve the problem of eating on the spot in the hotel.

msg:I came to Dongquan again during the New Year holiday.

Facilities: This time I booked a parent-child room and a deluxe king-size room. The deluxe king-size room has a lot of space, but the parent-child room is a bit compact. Fortunately, the children like the small tents and toys in the parent-child room. The hot spring facilities are one of the best among the many hot spring entertainment venues in Dalian. The parent-child room provides free play in the children's playground. The children had a lot of fun and made many friends.

Hygiene: The room hygiene is quite satisfactory.

Environment: I have been here many times, and the hotel environment is the same as always. The flowers in the corridor are also worth stopping to appreciate. The fish at the end of the corridor are like old friends. The outdoor environment is also very good, guarding the mountain and the air is fresh. Climbing Xiaohei Mountain and taking children to see small animals are essential parts of every visit. If you can insist on climbing to the top of Xiaohei Mountain in the morning, and with a little luck, the scenery will definitely not disappoint you, and it is worth the effort of climbing.

Catering: The ingredients for the buffet breakfast cannot be said to be high-end, but the variety is rich. The restaurant provides Chinese food at noon and night. The taste is good, the price is slightly above average, and the environment is much better than the farmhouse outside.

Whenever my friends mention taking their children to a hot spring, I usually recommend Dongquan. I hope it will keep up the good work and live up to the customer's recommendation.

My elderly parents had six lunches and dinners in the restaurant for three consecutive days. Manager Liu and other service brothers and sisters took good care of us. When they learned that they could not pack some breakfast for my father who had already paid for breakfast, Manager Liu took the initiative to provide us with a takeaway box (but according to regulations, buffets cannot be packed). During the peak holiday season, there were many guests staying in the hotel, and the restaurant service was appropriate, timely, effective and enthusiastic. The quality of the food was excellent. Although the quantity was a bit large, we had almost no repetition in the six meals. Thank you again!

It may be more convenient to go on weekdays if you want to go. There are not many outdoor hot spring pools, and there is one without water. It's ok to walk through long corridors to get from the room to the hot springs. The main reason is that the lady at the front desk of the hot spring depar**ent can't talk about any service, and she looks indifferent when asking about things. The hotel breakfast is 98, which is a bit unaffordable. It's not as reasonable as the hot springs in a certain lake. The room rate includes breakfast, and the breakfast is also very rich. In short, the experience is not good.

They said that the other rooms hadn‚Äôt been cleaned up yet, so we had to wait. When we asked when we could come to pick up the card, the waitress would be there. It's as irrelevant as if you didn't listen. I understand that there are too many people to clean up during the holidays, but what I don‚Äôt understand is the attitude of the front desk staff. Why can‚Äôt a standard room of such a high-end hotel be more than 800 yuan in exchange for a smiling face? Moreover, it was your hotel's own problem to check in at two o'clock as agreed, and it was your hotel's own problem. After discussing that the room was empty out, please inform me, but the result was a direct reply: No! The customer didn't say anything and she became impatient, and finally went to the front desk to get the card by herself at nearly three o'clock. A good hotel can't just look at whether it is luxurious or not. What matters is whether the management level can meet the standards. Anyway, I don't plan to go to this hotel again. By the way, the service of restaurants and hot spring clubs is okay. Also, remind others that normal standard rooms do not have balconies and are all facing north, and those with balconies facing south need to increase the price.

msg:This is the second time I came to this place on a business trip. The Faguo Hotel I stayed at for the first time was not the most satisfactory, so I chose the most expensive room rate in Pulandian this time. As a result, I didn‚Äôt sleep all night. The whole room was like a room where the elderly often live. It smells like an old man, and so do the pillows. I didn‚Äôt take off my clothes all night and didn‚Äôt dare to cover the quilt. I just lay down and waited for dawn, and the air conditioner was not cold at all. Faguo Hotel, the price/performance ratio is too average, if the traffic is inconvenient, and parking fees are charged, it is not ordinary expensive, this is the only time I was fooled

msg:Let me introduce in detail for friends who come here for the first time. We are two old people, mother and child, three children and one child. We live in a 90-square-meter two-bedroom and two-bathroom
1. Let‚Äôs talk about the guest room first. The hardware facilities in the room are okay, but the details can be seen that they are old, and the sanitary conditions are also good. The supporting toiletries are not very complete. According to the five-star standard, the skin care lotion and sewing kit are empty, and the bedding It's okay, it's more comfortable, the TV is a bit small, and the sound insulation in the room is OK
2. The hot spring part is 5-10 minutes away from the room. There is an internal corridor. The hot spring pool is divided into indoor and outdoor parts. Overall, it is okay. The swimming pool is divided into two parts. The paddling pool is a standard swimming pool. There are too few recreational facilities in the paddling pool , the swimming pool is 1.5-2.0 meters, it is very clean, and it is quite comfortable when there are few people
3. For meals, dine-in is not allowed for breakfast due to the small number of people. On the last day, dine-in is allowed, and we are guided to a small restaurant. The breakfast level is about three stars. It is not kept warm, and the dishes are very average, and many of them are gone.
4. There is a lunch buffet in the hot spring, 78 people, the dishes are okay, worthy of the price, there is also a dinner buffet hot pot in the hot spring, 78 people, the beef and mutton are not delicious, so-so, let‚Äôs go for lunch and dinner on the first day Dinner is settled at the Chinese restaurant, the dishes are good, almost no one is there, the food is served slowly, the service is average, and the waiters don't seem very happy
5. The overall service at the front desk is mediocre, there are few people, and the room is not upgraded. Two more bottles of water are required, and there is a charge, ice dew mineral water! It's a shame to charge me 3 yuan for a bottle!
6. The surrounding environment has mountains and water, and the air is very good. It is next to Donggou Reservoir and far away from the downtown area. Children and elderly people like it
Hope to improve service quality

msg:When traveling during holidays, you just need to be prepared for the crowds, but everything is quite satisfactory in all aspects. The hotel itself is neither disappointing nor particularly amazing, but the surrounding Xiaoheishan and its various small scenery are surprising! The overall experience is still very good! But what needs to be highlighted is: there are no tea bags and coffee drinks in the room. What is too much is that the coffee garbage left by the guests in the previous room has not been cleaned up. I hope this will not happen again next time! It is understandable that there is a lot of passenger flow and increased workload during holidays, but this kind of details can better reflect the hotel's service!

msg:Let me talk about the advantages first: the air is fresh, the environment is very good, the service attitude of the hotel staff is very good, the overall living environment of the guest room is ok, and after taking a bath, I ordered a massage service in the lounge hall. The eldest sister No. 1 is professional and very friendly. Very comfortable.
Let‚Äôs talk about the disadvantages: I came here on the afternoon of the 3rd of the National Day. Although there were many people, the check-in at the front desk was very efficient. I was mentally prepared for the large number of people on the National Day, so even if there were many female bathers, I had to wait for a seat and the outdoor pool was full. I can also understand the fact that a bunch of people in the water gather around to make jio. but! yes! I was really shocked by the breakfast the next morning. I went downstairs around 8:45, and there was a very long queue at the entrance of the restaurant (see picture 3). There are so many people on National Day. I can also understand, of course! and! When I entered the restaurant, I found out that it was overcrowded and there were no empty seats at all. Because the restaurant does not "put one table after eating" but just blindly let people go out even if no one finished eating, the people who entered the restaurant later There are no seats at all, but there are almost people waiting next to every table that has not finished eating. Due to the fact that there were too many people, the restaurant was crowded with people and the restaurant continued to put people in. In the end, neither of us could finish the breakfast for 98 people, so we checked out and drove back to Dalian to eat.
real! Heart! establish! Proposal! For restaurants, make emergency plans, divert meals for holidays when there are many people, and provide location guidance instead of just letting them go. After all, the experience in other aspects is very good, I hope Dongquan can do better and better.

The room is clean and tidy. There is a buffet at noon. The breakfast is good and there are not many people. But this time, a customer pushed a wheelchair in to take the elderly to take a bath, and brushed the wheelchair and crutches inside. The smell is too bad. I don't know if the waiter didn't see it and didn't remind me. Videos of other guests' bath experiences.

msg:The worst hotel I've ever stayed in, I really don't know how I chose it. I really suffered from spending money and made me angry. This service is really maddening. A hot spring hotel has a lot of rules, and the clothes you wear are wrong. I can't even eat, the toiletries provided in the room are not enough, and if you want another one, you will have to accept questionsüò§. From the moment of entering the door, there is no epidemic prevention inspection, no one even reads the health code, let alone other things. The front desk who was queuing to check in, just listened to her training the customer in front of meüò† that attitude. The so-called hot spring ticket given with the room is really a hurdle to use. If you go out of the hot spring, you will not be able to eat the buffet, and no one will remind you. The child is not tall enough and does not need a ticket, and no one reminds it. It's how the customer comes when he's not feeling well. I'm not staying in a hotel, I'm going to find it unhappy for myself. There are also few hot spring pools, and the bathing area is overcrowded. It's too bad. Breakfast was withdrawn at 9:30. Before anyone finished eating, he packed up and left first. He was speechless.

I called again to say that I would send them away, but I didn‚Äôt see anyone coming to deliver them after checking out the next day. The woman standing at the breakfast gate should give you a bad review! Actually staying in the hotel also charges parking fees! This trea**ent may be on par with Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou...

msg:The bed in the parent-child room is really big and comfortable. The toys in the room are all brand-name, and the floor manager said that they have been disinfected with children's special disinfectant, and the children like it better. If I knew it, I wouldn't need to bring a lot of toys. The room is on the fifth floor, the view is very good, full of greenery. The bathroom is also big enough, parent-child towels and bath towels are very cute. The only thing is that the crib can also be equipped with pure cotton sheets. The blankets seem to be uncomfortable, so I used the children's sheets and pillows I brought.
Although the children's play area in the hot spring is not big, it is not crowded during the Dragon Boat Festival. The outdoor hot spring water in the morning is very clean and the temperature is suitable. The butterflies hanging above the swimming pool are also beautiful. The flowers, plants, fish and birds in the outdoor hot springs, and the Buddha head wall carvings in the indoor hot springs are all good. It is a hotel worth visiting.
Children also like the outdoor animal area. The hotel is the mountain gate of Xiaoheishan, and you can climb it, and it takes more than half an hour to go back and forth.
