msg:My partner and I stayed here as we had an early flight the next morning. The location is PERFECT for the airport - it was less than 10mins by taxi. Also, the hotel is not on the flight path so you don’t get awoken by planes! The hotel is new so it’s clean, modern and very comfortable. 

Our only issues were with the staff, who were young and a little untrained. The day we arrived was quite warm and humid and I had problems cooling the room with the air con. When we reported it, we were given conflicting advice and it was kinda blamed on us (eventually, we learned they don’t have a cooling function during the winter months). Also, there was a restaurant attached hosting a party, which meant there was loud, drunken karaoke and cigarette smoke filling the lobby, which seemed inappropriate: I’m not sure why they didn’t just close the doors. I’m guessing the staff are new in the hotel game and still figuring it out, I’m sure this will get better.

For less than 400 yuan, you can sleep comfortably and the cleanliness is impeccable. The only downside is that it lacks some sense of design. It's good enough if you are on a business trip and have a comfortable stay. Thumbs up!

msg:Because my parents came to Xiamen to visit me, I booked a hotel for them temporarily. My father praised this hotel for its luxury. The room is indeed large but not modern enough. The hotel is located in Wuyuan Bay. Turn right after getting off Jimei Bridge. It is easy to find if you drive from other places without going through the streets and alleys. It is far from the scenic spots, but it has the advantage of few tourists around and a quiet environment. My family likes quietness.

There was no smile at the front desk, and the tone was lukewarm. They asked for two bottles of water for each room. Each room only comes with two bottles. For a room that costs more than 700 yuan, a bottle of water will not be provided for more than one yuan. I originally booked for two days, so I quickly canceled and ran away for a day. It was funny when I checked out. At about ten o'clock, the aunt knocked on the door and said, what the hell? Regarding hygiene, I was told that I needed to check out. The front desk called at 12 o'clock to confirm that I was checking out. Before I left, the aunt knocked on the door again and said that the front desk asked me to come in early to do the cleaning? ? ? ? ? I have stayed in hundreds of hotels, and this is the first time I encountered a rush of guests. The occupancy rate is not high, right? I don’t understand why I’m anxious.

msg:Let’s talk about the advantages first: the rooms are clean, the facilities are new, and the price-performance ratio is extremely high. During the Spring Festival, other hotels have doubled or tripled their prices, but this hotel only saw a slight increase. The hotel also provides airport pick-up and drop-off services.
Let’s talk about the shortcomings: the breakfast is very average, with very few choices. The hot water for bathing is unstable.
More suitable for business people

The overall environment is also good. The room is clean. I was in a hurry when I left. I left my documents behind and didn't notice. The front desk called me to inform me and helped me send the express. It was a very considerate service and must be praised! Also, I would like to say that Xiamen is so beautiful in this season! The sunset and sunset are so beautiful!
