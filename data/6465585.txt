msg:A superb location with ample ground and access to the park and lake. The service is excellent and the rooms are great although quite pricy. We tried the Chinese Reataurant which serves extremely refined food.
The main down point would come from the breakfast which is rather basic, and not at all at the level of the restaurants.
Great stay!

msg:The initial reservation was for the location, environment and the restaurant attached to the hotel. The location is really good, very close to Turtle Pond and Yuhu Bay, and you can enjoy the beautiful scenery of the secret land of West Lake by taking a walk every morning and evening. The hotel courtyard facilities and room facilities are also quite complete, the hygiene is very good, and the butler service is also in place. To be honest, although the Michelin Black Pearl is well-known, I didn't feel any surprises after eating. It was quite satisfactory, but the level was online. Although the breakfast was freshly made, I didn't think it was very delicious. Both Western and Chinese were a little greasy, and there was basically no choice for the set meal. As a resort that takes the route of small and beautiful and small and exquisite, I personally feel that in addition to the location and hardware, other added value is not enough, such as there are no activities with a sense of participation and experience, and the price of more than 4,000 per night is a little overpriced.

msg:This stay was very satisfying. The hotel's service attitude is particularly good, and the staff always maintains a friendly smile.
After booking the room, there will be a special housekeeper responsible for connecting various matters, booking restaurants, and sending some intimate reminders about the use of the room after checking in. If you have any questions, you can contact the housekeeper at any time through WeChat, and the service is very meticulous. The attitude of each employee is quite friendly. Because I arrived at the store late, the waiter would wait outside the door for me to put my luggage and then send me to the restaurant. The details of this service are very good.
The hotel room is Chinese style, with large space and complete facilities. The hair dryer is Dyson, and the skin care products and toiletries are also very good brands. Since it is checked in at night, the staff has already closed every door and window intimately after arriving in the room. There is a detail in the room that impresses customers very much, that is, the bookshelf is full of various books, instead of fake books piled up like other hotels, which are only used for decoration. It can be seen that the management team of this hotel has cultural heritage.
The breakfast of the hotel is unexpectedly delicious. The Chinese set meal I ordered, noodles, soup dumplings, tofu pudding, mochi, large portion, taste is not worse than the restaurant outside.
The location of the hotel is also very convenient. For foreign friends who are not familiar with Hangzhou, the location of the hotel is very convenient. After dinner in the evening, you can go out of the hotel and run around the West Lake at night. The environment is beautiful and comfortable, and the air is fresh and pleasant.
If I come to Hangzhou for tourism next time, I will choose Hangzhou Zixuan Resort again. This time's hotel experience made me very moved and satisfied. Looking forward to seeing you again.

msg:Zixuan Hotel did not disappoint. From the beginning, I locked in Fayun, Four Seasons, and Zixuan. I didn't like the style of Fayun, so I chose Zixuan and Four Seasons.
Half a month ago, Zixuan's housekeeper contacted me and added WeChat, enthusiastically recommended the surrounding guide, and introduced the hotel's Black Pearl Restaurant
Fortunately, I made an appoin**ent to learn about Xianglou and taste the delicious food by the West Lake
The guest room is very Chinese style, very suitable for staying for a few more days on vacation, brewing a pot of Longjing tea next to the blinds and listening to the rain.
Zixuan is indispensable for the beautiful memories of Hangzhou

The service attitude is very good, 24-hour butler service. It rained heavily on the day we arrived. The staff helped to hold an umbrella all the way from the parking lot to the room.
The geographical location is 3 kilometers away from Linyin Temple. If the weather is good, you can also walk there. It is also pleasant to pass by Longjing Village and breathe the natural oxygen bar.
Warm reminder: The hotel's Michelin restaurant needs to be booked in advance. Each table only receives a group of customers and does not turn over. We didn't make an appoin**ent this time and didn't eat it. It's a pity to come again next timeüòÑ

msg:I considered for a long time whether to choose Four Seasons or Zixuan. I am very happy to choose Zixuan. The service staff are very warm and warm. Although the breakfast items are not many, they are very delicate and full. The room is comfortable and quiet, without any unpleasant smell. The wardrobe is filled with the elegant fragrance of natural essential oils. The window is full of greenery and pleasant birdsong, which makes me forget the hustle and bustle around West Lake.
The highlight of Zixuan that I like most is that the room is very clean and tidy, and Huagang Fish Viewing is right next to it.
The only flaw is that the service staff accidentally used my check-in deposit of 5,000 yuan as a fee to request payment from the credit card company in full (we have prepaid the room price in full on trip.com). On March 22, 5,000 was deducted. I didn‚Äôt receive the refund after deducting the meal until April 11, and I also paid the RMB exchange rate difference between the inbound and outbound. The hotel did not handle this crisis very well. It just apologized and let it go. It did not express its willingness to bear the exchange rate loss caused by their own mistakes. This surprised me a little. After all, the hardware used by the hotel itself is very good. It is recommended to strengthen the soft service part, which will definitely be more perfect.
In addition, the day of check-in happened to be my husband's birthday, and we told the hotel in advance. When we entered the room, we saw a small birthday card, which made us feel like a small pastry was missing^_^. Fortunately, West Lake Grand Hyatt prepared a big box of birthday chocolates for us to celebrate our birthday on the day we checked out and went to Zixuan. The surprise that Zixuan didn't give us was given by West Lake Grand Hyatt when we checked out.

msg:During a three-day business trip in Hangzhou, I suddenly decided to stay at Amanfayun, which ranked first on Ctrip's Hangzhou hotel rankings, on the first day, Relais & Chateaux, which ranked third on the second day, and Relais & Ch√¢teaux, which ranked second on the third day. The ranking of the four seasons of West Lake is still accurate. The itinerary changed the next day. I arrived at the hotel early in the afternoon and checked in quickly. The room was decorated in a new Chinese style and was quite large. I returned to the hotel late in the evening and found that the light in the room was broken. It was flickering and scary. I called the front desk, but they couldn't get through from 11 to 12 o'clock. I got up early and went downstairs at 5 o'clock. When I returned to the room, the door could not be opened. It took me half an hour to get in. I went to have breakfast at 7:20 and found that no one was there. I asked the front desk and was told that 1. Maybe my phone was not put away last night, so I called It didn‚Äôt make sense, and asked why he didn‚Äôt send a WeChat message to the housekeeper. 2. Because there were few guests, there were only two households, and they probably wouldn‚Äôt get up early, so wait, there should be someone in the breakfast room at eight o‚Äôclock. I could only continue walking. After walking a few more steps, I found that the scenery next to it was beautiful and there were many birds. I went back for breakfast and unexpectedly found that it was delicious. However, I could only choose one kind. I didn‚Äôt dare to ask for more if I wasn‚Äôt full. Although it is the cheapest among the three hotels, I sincerely recommend that friends who see this place don‚Äôt save the thousand-bar price difference. It feels like a state-run guest house back then.

The children liked the Chinese breakfast even more. We had dinner at Jiexianglou, which was very delicious. Had afternoon tea in the afternoon, perfect trip!

Dinner was Omakase, a Japanese restaurant in the hotel, and overall I was quite satisfied.
The room has an independent corridor with air conditioning and is well received! In the winter, I feel drowsy when I turn on the hot air conditioner, and it‚Äôs too cold when I sleep without it. When you are resting in the room and do not plan to sleep, you can turn off the air conditioner in the corridor, sit in the corridor and take a nap, play with your mobile phone or even do simple work on the computer.

msg:The location is really good, perfect for traveling. We encountered a very unpleasant thing. We booked and paid for the Wenqiaochu Villa. When the housekeeper arranged for us to check in, he arranged us to stay in an ordinary guest room. Since we didn't know what the villa looked like, we didn't feel anything wrong on the spot. We stayed for three nights in a row, and the housekeeper found out after we checked out. I asked for a refund of the price difference and a small gift. I accepted the refund of the price difference, but the housekeeper kept emphasizing that the price difference was refunded to me. This attitude is somewhat unacceptable. Isn't it legal to refund the price difference? I asked the hotel to apologize and was told that it was impossible. This was the employee's personal mistake and the hotel would not apologize. We clearly rejected the small gift from the housekeeper through WeChat and phone. We don't need gifts, just an apology. I checked out on the 12th. I kept communicating and asking for it on the 12th, 13th, and 14th. We checked into the Banyan Tree on the 13th. We received a personal apology letter from the housekeeper and a small gift (should be a candle set) that we repeatedly refused. We immediately left the gift at the Banyan Tree front desk for them to take back. Finally, on the evening of the 14th, I received a call from someone who claimed to be the head of the housekeeping depar**ent. He first said that he wanted to apologize as soon as possible (but the fact is that I didn‚Äôt receive the call for the first time until the evening of the 14th), and then said that he never said he would not apologize (WeChat chat records repeatedly stated in black and white that the hotel‚Äôs refusal to apologize was the personal behavior of the employees), and then said that he contacted me because he was on vacation and couldn‚Äôt call me (then you were able to contact your own employees as soon as possible? Can‚Äôt communicate with me on WeChat?) In fact, we had already checked out and left. In any case, we couldn‚Äôt stay in the room we booked. We just wanted an apology, but we didn‚Äôt expect it to be so difficult. The refusal to apologize from the 12th to the 14th and the various contradictory words of the head of the housekeeping depar**ent who called me on the evening of the 14th were the main reasons that stimulated me to keep asking for an apology. I have trusted this brand for many years. When I checked in, I also said that I like to stay in Paris and Kyoto. The staff also replied to me at that time that we have no relationship and are just franchisees. Now I deeply understand this reply. There is indeed no unified standard of service. On the evening of the 14th, we communicated on the phone for 29 minutes. The head of the housekeeping depar**ent took the initiative to propose our next hotel and said in person, "Okay, I will stay at Amanfayun today and look forward to your visit."

When I saw the room type with a private courtyard, I immediately made up my mind to come and experience it. As expected, the experience after checking in was very good. It is completely different from traditional closed hotels. Zixuan Resort is connected with nature, giving people a sense of being hidden in the city, with a sense of mystery. The types of rooms and the number of rooms in the resort There are not many, each one is exquisite, and there are three Michelin-standard restaurants. Chinese, Japanese, and French food are all must-try places in Hangzhou. In short, the overall experience of Zixuan Resort is worthy of their price, and will definitely give visitors to Hangzhou a unique experience and long-lasting memories.

When the Asian Games were approaching, he reminded me several times about travel precautions. It was very heart-warming‚ù§ On the day I arrived at the hotel, I was told that the extra bed I originally asked for was due to other guests.

All supporting facilities are complete. The bathtub is also a jacuzzi. The children had a lot of fun. The entire resort is right next to the West Lake. It is very convenient to go to Huagang to watch fish. The resort itself is a scenic spot, and there are many people taking pictures just walking around. I went to the Western restaurant for afternoon tea. My kids loved it. I had lunch at the Chinese restaurant for my birthday and got longevity noodles as a gift. I was told to order the West Lake Vinegar Fish one day in advance. It was a pity that I didn‚Äôt get it. The breakfast was a set meal, but the content was very good.

At first the housekeeper said that it would take 7-8 minutes to walk into the courtyard room from the front desk, and thought it was too far inside and was inconvenient. In fact, the location is great. The Snow Boat in Yuhu Bay is just outside the door. It is simply beautiful. It is also suitable for babies who are not willing to walk. If you have any needs, you can take them back to the room at any time (for example, if you have a bad temper at the Snow Boat, you will be taken back directly. Room for shampooing and bathing)
The response and service of the room housekeeper are very timely. During the day, the security booth in the parking lot will help deliver takeaways.
Will definitely go again next time!

msg:I wanted to come last year, but I was delayed by the epidemic. I went to Zhejiang twice and suddenly returned to Shanghai because of the problem of the health code.
Since the hotel does not have a swimming pool, I chose a room with a swimming pool. The room has a small independent courtyard where you can drink tea and chat. There are many books in the room. If the weather is good, you can take a look in the courtyard. The scenery near the hotel is very beautiful. The lake is very blue. The afternoon tea and breakfast are both delicious. Xiexianglou‚Äôs Chinese food is even more memorable. The customer service at the front desk is very good and they are very enthusiastic about taking us around the attractions.

msg:In 2020, I was scared to death from the Lanruo Temple breakfast in Fayun to the first floor where Zixuan lived. I thought it was very good and left good memories. 2. In 3 years, I moved from Building 2 of Hangzhou West Lake State Guesthouse to Zixuan staying on the second floor. I am very satisfied. I like the bright porch. There is no fruit on the second floor. There are large blueberries covered with custom-made porcelain. The quality of the fruits here is average. The teapot is very poor. I put some biscuits in a bowl on the bed. I don‚Äôt know how it tastes. The cake breakfast is very greasy. The coffee bar's products are very good. I know that the Xianglou is better than before. The Ziwei Hall is not as good as the Kazakhstan State Hotel. I used to live in Building 8. This time I feel that the level of Building 2 has improved and I will become a fan. Next time Booking Hangzhou Tourism State Guesthouse and Zixuan can complement each other. I like both styles very much. Jiexiang Building still has no improvement in the peak room level. After building No. 2, I hope Zixuan will get better and better.

msg:The environment and location are very satisfactory, but I encountered some problems in ordering food. I told the housekeeper a week in advance that I wanted to book the Chinese restaurant Xiexianglou in the hotel. On the day of check-in, I was told that it could only be arranged until 5-7 o'clock, and it had to end at 7 o'clock , because there will be a second wave of guests at 7:30, after checking in, we still say that there is no place after 7:30, we just rushed to the restaurant to book this hotel. Under the strong request, I was told that it was set to 7:30. However, after we entered the restaurant at 7:20, there were three seats where no customers came from the beginning to the end, and there were two stalls of customers, one table dish, and the meal did not finish after 7:30, and we did not leave until after 8 o'clock. I was very confused. I asked the restaurant to order food a few days in advance, but the waiter said that it would be three to five days in advance. In summary, I feel that the housekeeper is not very active and accurate in following up on the location of the restaurant. It is recommended that the restaurant should position itself instead of asking the housekeeper, because it is not very reliable.

This hotel can really do it.
The hardware is top notch. The room is designed in solid wood, low-key and luxurious.
What impresses me the most is that the books in the room are not the kind of rich and cultured ones, they are indeed tasteful.
It is not easy to see Mu Xin's complete set of works in a hotel.
The service is in line with five-star. However, compared with some particularly good five-star hotels in Beijing, the service can still be improved.
This time I didn't order food in the hotel, but went to Banyan Tree to eat. It can only be said that the Chinese restaurant in Banyan Tree is average, and I will eat at the hotel next time.
Because, I see that there seem to be more people coming to this hotel to eat than guests.

msg:The French food in Sanyan Pavilion deserves its name. Xiexianglou personally thinks that it is not as good as the Four Seasons Jinsha Restaurant. Manshu does not recommend it. Meals are a very important part of the Relais & Ch√¢teaux experience and are generally positive.
It's very comfortable to live, but there is a big drawback: I booked the inquirer's office with an independent courtyard for the sake of cleanliness and privacy, and I don't want to be disturbed. It turned out that the aunt in charge of room service actually lived in the courtyard, and even the panoramic bathtub could be seen directly from the living area of the staff. This makes people uncomfortable. I'd rather wait an extra 15 minutes when I call for room service and wait for the support staff to arrive from afar (and we've never called for room service on my own initiative), rather than having the feeling of an outsider living with me on vacation.

There are many advantages and I will not say them one by one. There are a few shortcomings, and I hope to improve.

2. The air conditioner in the room is slightly noisy. Moreover, several control panels are placed side by side, and the control area is not clearly identified.

msg:I stayed in this hotel from July 13 to July 15. I was bitten by eight or nine bugs in the hotel on July 14. It was very itchy at the time, but I thought it was just mosquito bites and maybe it would heal in a few days, so I didn‚Äôt take it seriously. When I got home, the bugs The number of bites was increasing and it was getting more and more itchy. On the night of July 18, there were nearly 40 bites, which seriously affected my sleep. So I went to the local affiliated hospital on July 19. The dermatologist said it was caused by insect bites. Papular measles will take nearly half a month to heal. I can‚Äôt take steroid medicine and it will relapse if I am bitten by an insect. (My conversation with the doctor has been recorded and the diagnosis is attached below.) I have never had this disease before. The illness can be concluded to be caused by an insect bite in the hotel.

This symptom has seriously affected my personal life and sleep. I am woken up by itching many times in the middle of the night to apply medicine. I have asked for leave from the company and cannot work due to physical reasons.

When I explained the above situation to the hotel housekeeper and sent a series of certificates and medical trea**ent status, the hotel repeatedly shied away from responsibility and finally said that it could only bear 200 yuan for medicine. This is how I feel about the hotel. The attitude expressed great dissatisfaction and did not even say that the room rate was discounted. I stayed in a hotel that cost 4,000 a night. I thought this would not happen. I chose a five-star hotel mainly for service and hygiene. I was afraid that famous hotels and small hotels would not be able to do this. I did not expect it. I had such a bad experience. From the hotel manager to the housekeeper, they all shirk responsibility and have extremely poor quality.

During my stay, I asked the waiter many times if there were mosquitoes in the house. Is it possible to provide mosquito-repellent incense? But the waiter said, "Our hotel just doesn't have mosquito-repellent incense." (I also had some bad experiences during the period that I won't write about here.) Later, the hotel could only provide mugwort leaves. Inserting it into the fence outside the house is not effective at all. There is no way to do it. This hotel is full of insects. The hotel housekeeper did remind me not to open the windows inside the house, so I only opened it for a while while taking pictures of the outside scenery, but the hotel cleaning staff comes every time. When I was cleaning, I insisted on keeping the door open, saying it was for the convenience of entry and exit. I couldn't understand that cleaning was convenient, but there were so many mosquitoes outdoors... but I was bitten by mosquitoes because of this.

Since the hotel also knows that there are many mosquitoes, why can't they put some anti-mosquito facilities outdoors and in the house? I almost didn't see any. It's not that I asked for more. It's just because I stayed at Xishang Hotel before staying in this hotel (the two hotels are not far apart) ) Mosquito-proof facilities will be hung on the trees in their hotel and there will be mosquito repellents and mosquito-repellent coils in the house. It is true that your Relais & Ch√¢teaux hotel has a good ecological environment, but since you have chosen to arrange accommodation here, you should also consider this issue instead. You can still prepare basic anti-mosquito facilities after repeatedly citing ecological benefits on the phone.
