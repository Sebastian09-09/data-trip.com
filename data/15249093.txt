msg:From my client:


I stayed in the modern part of the hotel on the 13th floor. The view was stunning, the room was huge, and there were many amenities inside. The strangest thing was that the room lacked a refrigerator and kitchen utensils. In December (during my stay), the pool was completely closed, and there was no information about it. In fact, you find out about it not at the reception, but at the pool itself. As an experienced traveler who always moves around on my own, the hotel's location was quite advantageous. There are many small cafes nearby, a long beach, a beautiful wooden promenade, and several public transport stops, which are a 5-15 minute walk away. The hotel has private parking, which is convenient if you have rented a car. What can I say about breakfast? The reception and breakfast restaurant are located in the old part of the hotel. There is little lighting, the decor is old, and there is little aesthetic appeal. The cuisine is Chinese with elements of European food. Tourists who bought package tours and stayed in this part of the hotel had much worse rooms (the rooms were not renovated at all, the carpets were old, the wall paint was not great) than I did, who booked accommodation through this app. I would like to separately mention the work of the staff. The employees only speak Chinese, and they have no desire to assist you if you are a foreigner because they seem shocked and totally confused by you. Upon check-in, they did not provide any additional gifts that were provided by Trip.com when purchasing accommodation. As they say, the law there is one: if you need something, you have to insist on it using a Chinese translator and supporting documents. By the way, upon check-in, you have to leave a deposit, and most importantly, keep the deposit receipt so that you can get it back later.

I encourage you to make sure you keep a receipt for your initial deposit and confirm that it is returned prior to leaving. Our only complaint is we booked with Trip.com and prepaid for 5 nights. Due to flight delays we were only able to use 4 of the 5 prepaid nights. No refund was offered or even acknowledged.  I do not recommend using Trip.com. Terrible experience

msg:Hotel was really nice. Room was clean and bright. Everything was as described in the hotel description here. Room was big, the toilet was big, the bed was huge and the balcony was wide.
Sea view is a sea view, but not so perfect. On the fourth floor I can clearly see the sea and the beach, but you are surrounded by other buildings. So you don't have a totally clear view as on the Instagram photos. But that really isn't the problem, it is still nice. Beach is 5 minutes away. Two really great western restaurants are 3-10 minutes away ( check for the BRUNCH restaurant and check the DOLPHIN place ). Pool in front of the hotel is really nice and clean, full of plants and nice corners to chill.
Strange thing about the hotel is that there is no name of "Shanghai Huating Boutique Hotel". We were at the right location when we arrived, but you can only see "Sanya Baohong Hotel '' there across the street. So we asked around, everyone was pointing us to that Baohong Hotel ( check the building exterior of the picture I uploaded ) . We entered and it turned out that we were in the right place. So we checked in, took our key ( card ) and they directed us back to the rooms across the street. Anyway, we were worried at the beginning, but everything turned out to be really really good. I recommend this place for sure.

Swimming pool is really great, and there is even a 'rooftop' bar on the third floor. 5 minutes walk to the beach; food, shops, everything that you need is really close.

🏡 The room is really spacious, it is more like a studio apartment, then a hotel room. Suitable for a long stay, as you can even cook on your own kitchen.

❗️One thing that you should know, that check-in desk is located in another building on the opposite side of the road. It can be little bit confusing if you are not aware about it.

msg:This hotel is centrally located. It is within a short walking distance to the beach, restaurants and mall. The room was clean and spacious just as advertised. You also get a partial view of the ocean. 

Check-in: This was not a great start to the experience.  When you reach Shanghai Huating , there is a vacant reception desk with no signage as to where one should go. Due to the kindness of a passerby we were pointed in the right direction. The hotel is seperated into 2 buildings. The original/main building , where you need to checkin, is on the other side of the road and has a different name displayed. 

Reception: Although kind, it was evident they were very busy, therefore did not have the time to properly explain the basic information needed for ones stay. E.g. where the breakfast venue was,pooltimes etc

Cleaning Ladies: Were friendly and more than helpful. They gladly assisted with requests and shared the Wifi password which is not displayed in the room.

Breakfast: Traditional Chinese. There is some bread, fried eggs and a small selection of fruits available if you just need to fill a gap to start your day.

The room is fantastic with a full sofa lounge, a large comfy bed, and a million dollar view from the room (We had 1501 with a great view of the bay and the mountains). Breakfast was decent - eggs and toast and reasonable bacon for those with western tastes and a larger selection for local tastes. The pool area is nice but we spent most. of our time at the beach (Sanya Bay is a 20 minute scooter ride away and a better beach than Dadonghai in our opinion). Walk to the beach in under 10 minutes. Walk to restaurants and shops in under 5 minutes. We are here for two weeks at a non-peak time and give this room a 5 star rating, especially at the price we paid. We will definitely stay here from now on.

A baowan really annoying the whole day about the cap. We didn’t pay the breakfast but a couple of friends told us to not do it as there is nothing western on it and we are not in for noodles in the morning.

msg:The review is also true for the Baohong Hotel, since this hotel is one of the buildings of this hotel.
The hotel is located in a good location in Dadonghai Bay. There are many cafes and shops nearby, as well as bus stops from which you can easily get to your desired location. This hotel offers hearty breakfasts and a nice swimming pool in the shade of palm trees with different depths and children's slides. The stay at this hotel would have been wonderful if several unpleasant situations had not happened that absolutely ruined the entire impression of the vacation.
One day, after breakfast, getting ready for the beach, we could not find a beach bag, although we knew for sure that it should have been in the room. After contacting the reception and communicating with the hotel managers, we were told that the employees would study the video from the cameras and report as soon as they received the necessary information. After several hours, we went to the reception again and were told to wait a little longer. After a long wait, we had to turn to a translator, who explained to us that the hotel had conducted its own investigation and found out that the cleaning lady had thrown the bag in the trash. There weren't many things in the bag, but they were all necessary for a beach holiday, things like sunscreen, a beach chair, a children's swimming circle, etc. The child was very upset. The hotel offered to compensate us for the purchase or purchase these items ourselves and deliver them to our room. Naturally, this option did not suit us, since all the things were expensive for us, since they were purchased in different stores around the world and it was difficult to find suitable ones in the city of Sanya, plus, we would have to spend personal time, which no one would give us compensated. After talking with the hotel manager, we were told that one of the staff would go with us to the store and buy things that would suit us. The time was already past 12:00, in the tropics at this time the sun is at its most scorching and the heat is very intense. A hotel employee came to our room and we went together... We walked to the nearest store with some stale goods. Naturally, we were able to find little in this store, but nevertheless we bought one of the things. After that we went to another store, then to a third, fourth. Since we did not find any suitable product, the manager suggested that we go to the Pineapple shopping center, which is about 20 minutes on foot. 20 minutes walk under the scorching sun at the hottest time. Despite this, we came to this shopping center and bought all the missing things. The manager asked for forgiveness and we thought this incident would be over. But that was not all. Before leaving, at about 21:00 in the evening, we asked the reception to pack a lunch box for us the next morning, since we planned to leave the hotel at 07:00. To which we were told that we had to contact earlier and they could not do anything, even though the dining room opens at 06:30 and it is quite possible to make it before 07:00. It is worth noting that in this hotel communication with staff occurs exclusively with the help of a translator on the phone. The staff has little knowledge of foreign languages ​​and this is one of the disadvantages.
These situations could be considered trifles if upon returning home the following were not discovered: after checking the wallet, it was discovered that the 400 dollars that were kept in reserve in the safe and no one had access to it except us and the hotel staff were replaced with counterfeit ones. When trying to contact the hotel through the ctrip service, we were told that this hotel does not have an email address and can only be contacted by phone number. By phone number, with employees who speak foreign languages ​​poorly. We kindly ask tourists to be careful when staying in this hotel, and it is better to avoid booking rooms so as not to spoil their vacation.

From front desk reception, to room service, from restaurant management to security work, they all do a great job! For example, the front desk manager Zhou, after seeing me renewing my room many times, took the initiative to inquire about my needs, was warm and thoughtful, and upgraded us to a sea view room; such as the guest room supervisor, including Master Fu Rong, Miss Huang Xuanmei and other customer service staff, the cleaning work was timely and effective, and responded to all requests. For example, Manager Wu of the restaurant will leave work late to ensure that customers have a good meal. There are also security guards on duty in front of the building, who are exposed to the weather and strictly enforce security regulations. In short, Baohong Shanghai Huating Hotel is indeed a high-quality hotel with high cost performance and good service.

The room has everything you need, plenty of space to arrange all your things, there is a closet and many bedside tables, a separate cooking area, there is a microwave, stove, refrigerator, the only thing is if you want to cook you need to buy dishes and cutlery.
There is a separate sitting area with a large sofa, this room is very good for a family, I was with a child and we really liked it. There are 2 swimming pools outside, one for adults and one for children, and there are sun loungers.
The only negative was a very unpleasant smell when exiting the elevator in that area.
But in any case, I'm satisfied and would come back again.

The bed was changed every other day, you can ask for it to be changed every day. Always clean towels, there are also beach towels. We lived on the 10th floor with a sea view of Dadonghai Beach, beautiful. Good location, everything is nearby and quiet. There are many cafes, grocery stores, fruits, McDonald's nearby. You can walk to the sea in 7-10 minutes, slowly. You can walk to the sea from both sides; if you go to the left, it’s quiet there (just the beginning of the Dadonghai embankment). It’s a 10-minute walk to the winter shopping center, 15-20 to the pineapple, depending on how you walk. The pool seemed cold at first, but it warms up and by 12 o’clock it’s already good, we swam a lot in the pool, and so did the children. The children's slides are great, they always worked. The hotel area itself is all green, it’s very nice to walk in the evening, without noise, calm and at the same time everything is nearby. We had breakfast in Bakhong, there is a large selection, you won’t go hungry. I recommend.

The cleaning is good, the only thing is that the floors are not very clean and the robe was taken away twice. They probably wanted to change it and forgot to put in a new one. At the request of the administrator from the reception they immediately returned it. Towels are changed every day, which is very nice. Bed linen was changed on the sixth day. Cosmetic items were reported daily.
We stayed in a superior room with a sea view. Excellent large area, spacious shower. Two air conditioners in the room. In the drawer between the beds there is a Raptor with an outlet. There are beach towels in the closet opposite the beds (noticed on the last day, eh). Three sinks. Lots of light. Powerful hair dryer. The beds are comfortable, hard. There was no smell of cigarettes in the smoking room. Wifi works, but intermittently for a couple of days.
Advice as a tourist: download Google or Yandex translator and download Chinese, Russian, English languages ​​to use offline. And download different ***, “******” worked well for me. If it doesn't translate or doesn't connect to the Internet, rebooting the phone usually helps.
Without a ***, you will not be able to use Google services, send photos to WhatsApp, or access Telegram only through hotel Wi-Fi.

My mother especially liked this balcony, where she could see the sea in the close range, the mountains in the distance, and the bright night view. You can also cook. The community has its own swimming pool. To be honest, I am very satisfied with it. Check-in is at the Baohong Hotel across the road from the hotel, which is very convenient. Wang Lei at the front desk is very welcoming and the service is great. I added WeChat so I can contact her anytime if I have any questions. It was my first time in Sanya and I felt warm in my heart. If I come to Sanya again in the future, I will choose Baohong.

msg:Not recommended. The biggest problem is the bed.
This is the worst spring mattress you can imagine. A thin mattress is directly covered with sheets, and you can easily feel the position of the springs in every part of your body. One night passed and my whole body ached. This is the first time I have stayed in such a bed except for staying in a youth hostel more than ten years ago.
In comparison, everything else is a minor issue. For example, this hotel has no front desk service, and all procedures are handled at the front desk of another hotel a hundred meters away across the road. For example, if the wifi password is not informed, you need to call the front desk to ask.
Except for the bed, the other problems in the room were completely tolerable, even pretty good. The room is large, the balcony is beautiful, and the shower room is very good.

I think that since this hotel is rated as five-star after all, I feel that it should not make such a terrible mistake in a few places. I suggest asking the hotel staff to confirm whether your home meets such standards. If not, then the [cleaning staff of the building without a front desk], who are out of your reach, are probably slacking off to a serious extent.

Rooms with a kitchen, but you have to pay for the kitchen separately, otherwise it’s just decoration that you can’t use. The pool is open from 10am to 10pm. Breakfast is not very varied, the coffee is made from powder, but you can choose something. The hotel significantly reduces the price the closer the arrival date is. Right before arrival the prices are 2 times lower. So at a discount this is a very good offer, at full price it is probably overpriced.

2. The hotel facilities are very good and complete. There are adult and children's swimming pools in the hotel, as well as a children's washing pool, which is very suitable for parent-child travel.
3. The hotel room is very large. The big bed room has a living room and a laundry pool on the balcony, which is suitable for long-term vacations.
4. Especially the praise is: the hotel service is very good. The accommodation invoice was accidentally washed, so I contacted the assistant manager of the front desk of the hotel (Xiao Li and other staff whose names are not known), they actively contacted the finance depar**ent, provided the invoice back slip, and stamped the invoice stamp, and promptly Send it back by Shunfeng Express, 👍

Next time I come to Sanya, Baohong will still use hand drills, 👍👍👍

Compared with Sanya Bay, Yalong Bay, and Haitang Bay, Dadonghai is closer to the main city, and it is also in a moderate location from major places to play. . It takes 3 minutes to walk from the hotel to the beach. There are all kinds of food near the hotel. There are also summer depar**ent stores as a guarantee for shopping. The price/performance ratio is also good, and the conditions are not bad. Ting Select Hotel 🏨

Given the low season in May and China has recently opened after a pandemic - few people live, check-in / check-out is carried out through the reception of the neighboring Baohong hotel (one network).

msg:As soon as you enter the first hotel on the Banshan Peninsula, the dross vinegar on the second floor is delicious. But I made a mistake. The expensive room type is in the building of the community across the road from the hotel, but check-in is still in the lobby of the old hotel, which is too inconvenient. Clean up the room promptly and cleanly.

It is said that the battery is dead. Shouldn’t the battery be checked according to the approximate time? …I waited a long time to get in, and it was uncomfortable. The price is still relatively expensive. After all, the window view is not that good. The room is very big and I like it

msg:Dear leaders of Baohong Shanghai Huating Hotel:
       Hello!
       It may be a bit old-fashioned to write a letter to evaluate the hotel and your staff, but I really want to express some of my feelings sincerely. The price of the hotel is affordable, the facilities are complete, and it is also very suitable for long-term stay. Because it is a hotel-style apar**ent, I have chosen your hotel every winter for the past three years. The vicinity of the hotel is very convenient for entertainment, shopping and dining. In short, Baohong Shanghai Huating Boutique Hotel is my best choice. The second reason for writing this letter is to thank Manager Wang Lei, Manager of the Datang Depar**ent. Because of my health, I am not used to the cold temperature in winter in my hometown, so I stayed in the hotel for a long time. She has given me a lot of help. Whether I am asking about hotel issues or things I am not clear about, she will always answer me very patiently. After work, she will also chat with me. The parents are short-lived and very warm. Although Sanya It's just my place of residence, but I feel the warmth of home in Baohong. The hotel is not only fully equipped in terms of hardware, but also in terms of humanistic care, which other hotels cannot do. I remember that I accidentally booked rooms on two platforms at the same time because of the price adjus**ent of the hotel during the Chinese New Year. Manager Wang contacted me in time after seeing it. , but Manager Wang told me very clearly that I made a double reservation. So I searched carefully again, and finally found the order, which saved me a lot of losses. I am really grateful to her for being so careful and patient in her work. The relationship between guests and hotel staff, if she does her job well, it is only natural, but she not only does her job well, but also helps guests recover losses, and gives them humanistic care. I really think that Baohong has such a Employees, under the leadership of such a manager, the team will get better and better, and the guests will be more affirmed by your work. I also believe that you will build your reputation and give people who come to Sanya for tourism or sojourn a better experience! It also adds splendor to building a beautiful tourist city in Sanya! Finally, I sincerely wish Baohong will get better and better, and I also thank Baohong for providing me with a small home in Sanya, and thank Manager Wang for his gentle and beautiful smile, kindness and kindness!

The meal for two in the deduction 2 set meal is similar to the box lunch, it is really not delicious and the amount is small. And when I entered the restaurant, I didn't even see a waiter. I almost thought I was going to the wrong place. I waited for a long time to see someone.
Deduction of 3 points. The welcome fruit never came, and it came immediately after I called. It can be seen that the hotel does not remember at all, and the quality of only three fruits is not good.

msg:🍃Environment: Check-in is across the road from the hotel. There is only one staff member at the front desk. It took half an hour for check-in. The photo of the hotel shows that the furniture is old and has a strange stench, and the floor is particularly dirty and full of ash. The sheets were also a little dirty. After sleeping for a while, the whole body started to itch, and after a while, the whole body became red.
Hotel sound insulation is particularly poor. When I went back to the room at 9 o'clock in the evening, the voice of the bar downstairs was very loud, and I could still hear it clearly after closing the balcony door. There was no sound until around 12pm. After the bar sound ended, I could clearly hear the couple on the same floor arguing at 1:00 in the morning! There was a heavy knock on the door, the quarrel was loud from 1am to 3am and I couldn't sleep at all. The voice of welcome at the entrance of the parking lot downstairs also kept ringing. The room is along the street, and the noise of the car downstairs is so loud that it woke me up at 8am. It was almost 12 in the afternoon that the bar downstairs started to be noisy again, and a bunch of people were taking pictures and chatting.
The curtains in the room can't be drawn at all, and the light is still transparent underneath, which is very bright. The phone in the room was very dirty, and the room number on the phone didn't match the room.
There is no need to swipe the card in the hotel elevator. There are many people coming in and out, and the security is very poor!
The sink in the room was clogged, and the water didn't go down at all after washing my face!
🔔Service: I didn’t call until the check-out time at the front desk. I said to pack up, and I’ll be ready soon. Five minutes later, I called again and said that I would deduct half a day’s room fee, or I asked someone to come to the room and force us to leave. The attitude of the waiter was particularly bad, because I couldn't sleep because of the noise last night and I woke up late in the morning because of the noise outside. After renewing the room, I asked to clean the room, and I waited for forty or fifty minutes before cleaning.
The free room upgrade at the front desk is actually full of routines. The next day when I renewed my room, I was told to book a room with a higher price than the initial price, because this room was upgraded for me. I asked to change rooms and go directly to the one I booked at the beginning. The front desk said that there is no more room, so I can only upgrade the room with the higher price.
Overall, it's a pit! I don't know where those good reviews come from, so be careful when you check in!

The little girl at the front desk upgraded us and it was very nice. Hotel-style apar**ent, the room is very big, there are many lights, and there are two main lights, which are also very bright at night. There is also a large balcony facing the swimming pool in the park. The swimming pool has a slide which looks good, but it is a pity that there is no time to play. There are poles on the balcony to hang clothes.
There are sofas, refrigerators, induction cookers and range hoods, ovens, and cooking. The ovens are still Casarte’s.
The best thing is the bathroom. There are two showers on the left and right, so that you can take a bath with your child.
There are many wicker chairs in the lobby on the first floor. It is very convenient to take a taxi to the city. There are restaurants and supermarkets not far from the house, and the beach is about ten minutes away.
The water quality on the beach is much better than Sanya Bay, but the beaches are full of shells, stones, and coral fragments, which are very pierced, and the water is relatively deep, making Bialong Bay much cooler.
There are a lot of entertainment on the beach, there are water projects, and there are a row of bars on the shore. It should be great to sit and blow the sea breeze at night.
Playing in the water during the day and taking a taxi for 20 yuan at night to the Yemeng Corridor, catching hermit crabs is very interesting.

It's so cute. I don't want to go back to the room when I take her to swim. The hotel service is also excellent, especially Xiao Yang at the front desk, who was very patient and arranged a room with a good location for us. During my stay in the hotel, if I have anything to do, I can find the lady sister Xiao Zhang and Xiao Fu at the front desk to solve it. Eating near the hotel is also very convenient, it is really a good choice for traveling with children.

msg:Если вы отдыхали в апартаментах в Таиланде , то это примерно так же - просто снять дешево апартаменты с уборкой . Соотношение цена качество хорошее . Отдыхающие в основном Казахстан , Россия , Белорусь и немного Китай . Дадунхай в целом в основном для иностранцев из стран СНГ. Мы путешествовали месяц , были в разных отелях . Эти апартаменты нас вполне устроили , как вариант на смену , тк есть кухня ( для семьи с детьми может пригодиться ), две двухспальные кровати , большой диван и стол , большой балкон . Уборка посредственная , как и во многих местах даже класса выше - но смена полотенец каждый день , белье тоже меняли по-моему раз в 3/4 дня . Воду ставят . Сервиса никакого нет, но мы за эти деньги ничего и не ожидали . В номере неприятно пахло - поменяли без проблем, за это спасибо .До пляжа идти минут 10 прогулочным шагом с детьми 7 лет . Пляж с загоном со свистунами , купаться за пределами загона нельзя. На мой взгляд лучший вариант в округе , тк по цене и качеству лучше остальных, что рядом .

我這次住的時間很短，但是父母住的時間長，反饋也很贊。唯一遺憾，不是寵物友好酒店，如果可以成為寵物友好，就太好了。

msg:Это наш третий визит на Хайнань и это лучший отель, в котором мы останавливались тут (до этого жили в отеле Южный Китай и ГестХауз). Это третий корпус отеля Баохонг, заселение и завтраки проходят в главном корпусе через дорогу, но это нисколько не смущает, очень близко, только перейти дорогу. 
Заселили нас быстро, мы бронировали самый обычный номер, а нам его повысили до категории с видом на море. 12 этаж номер 1201, угловой, вид просто шикарный, каждый вечер сидели на балконе, любовались и каждое утро встречали новый день там же. 
Номер очень понравился, просторный, это, по сути, квартира-студия, так как находится в комплексе апартаментов, рядом ещё 3 дома и у них общая территория с бассейнами. Номер около 60м2, на входе кухня с печкой, микроволновкой (если ими пользоваться, то нужно доплатить 50 юаней в день, мы не пользовались), есть раковина, шкафчики и большой холодильник. Это очень удобно, особенно для тех, кто с детьми. Мы кухней пользовались только когда мыли фрукты и готовили чай, удобно, что большой холодильник с хорошей морозилкой, а не охлаждающий ящик как в обычных номерах. 
На номер 2 бутылки питьевой воды, 2 вида чая. Кофе нет. Из посуды только 2 кружки и 2 стакана. Дальше в номере у нас была гостиная зона с большим угловым диваном, телевизором (русских каналов нет), окно за диваном (было видно море), под телевизором тумбочки. Даже есть весы. Дальше идет небольшая декоративная перегородка, отделяющая гостиную зону от спальни. Кровать удобная. Две тумбочки рядом. Письменный стол, дополнительно маленький стол под мелочевку. Большой шкаф, в нём сейф и вешалки. Пляжная сумка, пляжные тапочки и полотенца. Также дополнительно шкаф есть в коридоре. Тоже большой. 
Санузел просторный. Большое зеркало во всю стену, что очень удобно. Каждый день меняли полотенца: большое, для рук, ног и маленькие салфетки. Шампунь, гель для душа, кондиционер, бритва, расческа, шапочка для душа – это всё меняли каждый день.
Убирались в номере очень хорошо, каждый день мыли пол, девушка аккуратно складывала разбросанные наши вещи, ко входу ставила тапочку, умничка, очень приятно такое обслуживание. 
Самое главное достоинство номера – огромный балкон  с видом на море и тропический лес из пальм. Вид открывается просто шикарный. На балконе стол и два стула, а также есть что-то вроде барной стойки, куда вмонтирована раковина – рабочая, можно мыть фрукты или руки, что очень удобно. 
У отеля красивая, ухоженная и зеленая территория. Возвращались каждый день в отель с большим удовольствием, прогуливаясь по территории. Есть несколько бассейнов, шезлонги и две детские горки. Мы были зимой на Новый год, много писали о том, что вода в бассейне ледяная, нам так не показалось, мы с удовольствием купались и загорали у бассейна, да и много людей вместе с нами тоже купались, может от того, что повезло с погодой – каждый день была жара под 30 градусов. 
Завтрак. Не самый лучший из тех, что у нас бывал, но вполне наедались. Для нас главное, что на завтрак готовят бульон с разной лапшой и зеленью на выбор, а также жарят яичницу. Кроме того, есть пельмешки, рис, несколько горячих блюд, огурцы, помидоры, салат, зелень. Сосиски сладкие невкусные. Был бекон вполне ничего. Фрукты разные, но не сладкие. Выпечка и целая куча разных видов хлеба. Сок разбавленный сильно. Чай невкусный, брали из номера пакетики Липтона и там заваривали. Кофе – одно название, везите с собой из дома. Завтрак можем оценить на 3 из 5, но нам всего хватало, каждое утро наедались. 
В отеле при заселение берут депозит, можно долларами, евро или юанями. С нас взяли 300 юаней, после выселения их вернули. 
Вай фай в номере работал, но мы больше пользовались роумингом, поэтому скорость и качество сильно оценить не можем. 
Подводя итог, отель очень понравился, особенно номер и территория. С удовольствием вернемся снова и вам рекомендуем!

缺點：比較老舊的五星酒店和現在的三星水平接近。不要想海景房可以通過陽台看見大海，得轉頭才可以。所以還是園景房。 重點：坐在陽台上看不見大海🌊床墊子比較硬，比較潮濕。
早餐可以，比較豐富。 地板是瓷磚，不是地毯。
就還行吧。

Единственное, что было минусом: лежишь себе у бассейна. Как вдруг включается ядовитая дезинфекция в виде дыма. И это всё распространяется на отдыхающих. Такие операции можно проводить ночью, или рано утром.

msg:Проживали с семьёй, самый большой минус этого отеля,это очень очень плохие матрасы, жесткие, не удобные,спать было очень тяжело. Плюсы это месторасположение отеля. На море не далеко, и торговые центры рядом. Бассейн рядом. Если же вы живёте в главном здании,то бассейн для вас через дорогу,имейте это ввиду.  Завтраки средние,но голодными не останетесь,очень удобно что завтрака до 10.30. Чистота конечно не очень, в моем номере пол мыли плохо, по углам оставался мусор,за сутки до выезда забыли положить чистые халаты, в столовой увидела рыжего таракана)))) Если отель заменит матрасы на более мягкие ,то обязательно вернусь снова. Я проживала в корпусе А.

Совет - кто собирается готовить берите кастрюлю/сковородку, в номере этого не предусмотрено. Убирались каждый день, постоянно пополняли запасы средств личной гигиены. До моря пешком минут 7 ( к сожалению, прямого прохода к морю нет, хоть оно и видно было с балкона, идти надо в обход). Рядом куча кафе разной ценовой категории, в 3 минутах ходьбы супермаркет, много маленьких магазинов. Отель для отпуска рекомендую!
