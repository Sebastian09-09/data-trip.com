msg:We came with our 20-month old toddler for a staycation during the long weekend. We upgraded to the club room and the service and amenities were worth it. Even though it rained on both days, there were plenty to do at the hotel. All three of us had a nice soak in the large bathtub in our room when it rained hard outside. The room was spacious and clean, and the bed was huge and comfortable. The hotel was very thoughtful to have even left a child-size slippers, children dental kits, and a toddler mattress in the room. When it wasn't raining, our boy really enjoyed himself at the beach, indoor pool (and hot tub), and the waterpark, and so did we. There was also a huge outdoor playground by Joy Kids that featured several activity hubs like climbs and slides, foam construction blocks, and a merry-go-round ride. The breakfast at Mercado had a great spread that included cold cuts and cheeses, great coffees, freshly squeeze juices, and delightful pastries. We had nice simple afternoon teas and a more lavish evening cocktails at the club, but you should arrive earlier in the evenings to enjoy the full spread. Ms Jennifer was attentive and helpful when we were there and also helped us with a pleasant check-out. We highly recommend this place for families with young children.

msg:Overall, it met my expectations of the price I paid.  There was a little cleaning problem with the mat but the supervisor picked up the case and stated she will take care of the issue right away and sincerely stated it won't happen again, and I believed her because she was the one that came to me directly asking if there are anything the hotel can improve.  That is very good feeling that the hotel actually came directly to me and ask me what they can do to improve.  That deserves 10 more points..  This hotel prices are reasonable, so for me I am really to give this hotels or groups a yes next time!!

I bought an easy-to-open coconut from supermarket but the opener broke. I asked if the kitchen could help. Not to make us disappointed, they send us a free coconut. We were very impressed by their service.

msg:I would like to talk about the travel experience. This trip brought me an excellent travel experience. The entire itinerary was arranged very reasonably, and there was enough time for us to visit each attraction. The guide's explanation of each attraction was also very vivid and interesting, which gave us a deeper understanding of the local culture and history.

I am very satisfied with the professionalism of the tour guide team. Each tour guide is very professional, very knowledgeable about the attractions, and able to answer various questions we asked. During the trip, the tour guide will also introduce us to the local customs, food and culture, so that we can better integrate into the local life and culture.

I am impressed by the excellent customer service of the travel agency. Before departure, the staff of the travel agency will answer our questions in detail and provide us with a detailed itinerary and precautions. During the trip, if there are any questions or help needed, they will immediately provide us with support.

msg:Incredible jaw dropping outdoor heated pool and unheated children’s water playground. A private fake beach connected to a 1.4m depth pool. Perfect for my 1 and 5 yo. Not many staff speak English so unfortunately difficult to get any decent service - even from concierge for a simple restaurant recommendation was painful. Watch out for 
mould in the pool. Needs closer cleaning. The room is so old and tired but they try their hardest to keep it clean. Unfortunately the ventilation in the toilet was terrible and the room smelt like sewage. Loud clubbing music was playing outside the window facing the pool until at least 9pm - I fell asleep to the sound of the beat. There’s no sound insulation so not great for light sleepers - heard 5-6 other guests walking back to their rooms at night.

msg:We have a very good  stay.  The first surprise is that our rooms are upgraded.  Just want to say "thank you very much".   The rooms are  very spacious  and newly renovated.  The bathtub is  large, which comes with a view .  The room has a balcony with a view of the swimming pool  and a glimpse of  " China Splendid".   When you arrive your room, you will exclaim with "wows" and  feel relaxing when you step out to the balcony.

We paid the room rate together with breakfast, whch is cheaper than you buy separately,    It's conveneient to eat there and head out to  the swimming pools and sight-seeing.  The buffet  has  a wide seletcion of  food.  It has freshly squeezed juice - it's  very rare to see now.   I must give a thumb up to the two staffs, who are busy squeeziing juices to all those demaning customers.

The swimming pool with slides and waterfun activies are in the shade.  Even though  it's even blazing hot outside,  you can still enjoy and have fun.  It's prefect for us.  My children do not want too thrilling slides.    I also don't want my heart to beat too fast!   Another huge pool is very relaxing to swim , float and there's  a pool bar.

We went to Go-Kart on our last day,  whcih was $10 Taxi drive.  My teenage son had a blast.  Thank you very much to the Cconcierge Kevin, who helped us to check whether it was open and get a cheaper rate on the App.  

I would strongly recommend to this hotel for a relaxing weekend  with the kids.   You can defintly chill out.     When you stay in Shenzhen hotels,  you can always expect 5-star services.   InterContinental  Shenzhen certainly lives up to the expection with a fraction of the price.

The room itself would have been perfect but it definitely needs updates because I cut my foot on a carpet nail that was sticking out. The staff came to check on me very promptly despite this and the language barrier (took 3 calls). It’s a common thing with the carpet problems in Shenzhen, so I think the atmosphere of the hotel and the location are great with a mark down on the updates of the rooms.

Kris was honestly what made it different and special so my comment here goes to her as a grateful family. Will stay again for sure.

There wasn't a lot nearby that was super close in walking distance. The pool is large and goes on forever, and there is even a small slide and a man-made beach! It is easy to stay at the hotel for days and not run out of things to do. We look forward to coming back sometime!

🛏 【️ Shenzhen OCT InterContinental Hotel Accommodation Guide】

📌 Hotel Overview Overview

❶. Comprehensive evaluation: There are 59 InterContinental brand hotels in China (including Taiwan Province and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region). The suffix of their names is generally "InterContinental Hotel" or "InterContinental Resort Hotel", but there are exceptions, such as: InterContinental Hotel Jiuzhai Paradise, InterContinental Hotel Chengdu Global Center Paradise, InterContinental Hotel Lhasa Holy Land Paradise, InterContinental Hotel Chengdu Century City Paradise, Jinjiang Tomson Hotel, InterContinental Hotel Shenzhen OCT... The reason why these hotels have special names is that the first four are because they all belong to the same Chinese owner (Sunac Cultural Tourism, which is the original Yunnan Tourism Investment and the earliest Century City Convention and Exhibition), which is a unified, local "separatist" name; the reason for the latter two is that the guest rooms are large in size and they are benchmark legendary hotels in the region in terms of historical status and building complex itself. Therefore, living around InterContinental OCT, you will feel that this is a self-contained independent community with a strong tourism and business atmosphere. For 18 years, this has been the source of youth for Shennan Avenue; 
❷. Brief description of the location: There are 97 central enterprises in China, and three of them are headquartered in Shenzhen, including China Electronics at the vice-ministerial level, and OCT and CGN at the bureau level. The Happy Valley and Window of the World tourist area where OCT InterContinental is located is one of the ultimate destinations for any tourist who goes to Guangdong to check in.

🏨 About the guest room In Room

❶. Guest room layout: The hotel arranged a 75-square-meter executive single-bedroom king-size bed suite with pool view for me, which is second only to the 688-square-meter presidential suite, hidden room type, 130-square-meter garden duplex suite, and 106-square-meter Chinese suite. In addition to a wide variety of foreign channels (the hotel has a very high proportion of foreign guests), there is also a "Movie World" to choose from, and the film library is huge. The balcony is very comfortable and the scenery is invincible (the surrounding greenery is too good, don't forget, the city with the most parks in China is Shenzhen, so envious), and the bathtub is big enough for two children to play;
❷. Welcome gift: The fruit plate is exquisite and rich enough, as if you are on the tropical island of St. Kitts and Nevis. San Aino sparkling mineral water is also from Spain, full of details!

☕️ Dining

❶. Gourmet glimpse: The milkshake in the all-day restaurant is the highlight, a magic weapon to seduce taste buds; pineapple buns are of course the most authentic in Guangdong;
❷. City gluttony: Turn right and you will reach Exit C of the "Overseas Chinese Town" subway station, which is convenient for eating anywhere (in fact, there are a lot of business groups around the hotel, which can fully meet your various taste needs);
❸. Executive Lounge: The breakfast a la carte menu is rich in variety, and the white-cut chicken and soft European bread during happy hour are my favorites. There are outdoor areas and ambassador/royal ambassador private areas. This flaming red lip-style color scheme spreads from the suite to every corner of the lounge and lobby public area. It is passionate, unrestrained, and free and easy, and it always highlights the Spanish and Caribbean themes. The lounge (business center) and the suite I stayed in are at the two ends of the same floor, ensuring the quietness and privacy of the guest room.

🏊 Hardware Facilities

❶. Hotel environment: Because it is deep in the tourist destination building complex, the hotels built by OCT here are completely integrated into the context and vacation culture. The Venice Indigo focuses on the Italian water city culture, and the OCT InterContinental focuses on the Caribbean style and rich Spanish culture. This upstream and downstream differentiated layout is similar to the Universal Studios Grand Hotel and NUO Hotel in Beijing Universal Studios, and the Toy Story Hotel and Paradise Hotel in Shanghai Disney Resort. No matter which ethnic group you come from, you can find a place to live that suits you, and they are all close to the scenic area. Take the InterContinental OCT for example. From the guest rooms to the public areas, from the sculptures and decorative paintings to the coffee cup patterns and room colors, all highlight the bullfighting culture, as if you are in the streets of Madrid or the Caribbean countries, full of exotic customs, saving you from going abroad - this was a very popular practice at the time, such as Beijing's World Park and Shenzhen's Window of the World. After all, at the beginning of reform and opening up, on the one hand, people were eager to communicate, integrate and integrate with foreign cultures; on the other hand, most people still did not have the financial resources to go abroad, and this type of resort filled this gap; 
❷. Recreation and fitness: After the college entrance examination, summer vacation is coming. Soon, the national hotel industry will usher in the traditional "swimming pool season (money-making season)", and the leader in this regard is naturally InterContinental OCT. The swimming pool is divided into two areas, indoor and outdoor. It is open until 12 o'clock in the evening, fully meeting the needs of family happiness. The pirate ship "intrudes" in the scene, which further highlights the gracefulness and fantasy of the fairy tale world. No child will dislike it;
❸. Children's play: Utopia Amusement Club is one of its characteristics. It is similar to a miniature version of Club Med hosting. Babies like it very much.

🌟 Unforgettable Moments the Moments
❶. Star employee: Manager Kan (Hina) has been taking care of me meticulously throughout my stay. From the communication before check-in to the comprehensive arrangements during check-in, I deeply felt that IC's "continental" and warm encounter are so beautiful. Thank you! Guo Zihao (Alan) from the front office department is a handsome guy from Xi'an, the ancient capital of 13 dynasties. His peerless appearance is hard to find in any seven-star platinum diamond hotel next to InterContinental, not to mention. He has the potential to join an idol group. Besides being handsome, his professional ability is also comparable. He arranged everything for me perfectly, saving me a lot of unnecessary energy and time. Thank you! The bellboys' attire is a major feature: OCT InterContinental mainly has male bellboys in bullfighter costumes; Venice Indigo has both male and female bellboys in sailor suits, which gives a strong sense of immersion;
❷. Number of stays: I have stayed in this hotel 9 times, and this is the 10th time;
❸. Tips: I often host performances at the nearby Spring Cocoon Sports Center (such as the Nanshan Pop Music Festival musical special, etc.) or watch performances in the IHG box upstairs as an audience (such as Mo Xi Zi Shi/Hu Defu/Haomeimei folk music concerts, etc.). Based on the principle of proximity, InterContinental Group will choose the ticket collection location at OCT InterContinental Concierge. After you get the ticket, you can drive to the performance. It is very close; also because it is close to the performance venue, the grassroots staff participating in the performance generally stay at Donghua Holiday Inn, while the participating stars/artists/guests choose to stay at OCT InterContinental, so the star-studded rate of this IC is very high. The food and drinks in the private rooms are generally provided by Donghua Holiday Catering Department; the same is true in Beijing, where the food in the private rooms of Huaxi Live InterContinental is generally provided by the nearby Southwest Huayu.

📍 Brief summary Conclusion

❶. Wonderful moments: Due to its superior geographical location, good reputation, and safe and reliable background of central enterprises, OCT InterContinental is often the designated foreign guest reception hotel by the municipal government and the district government (Nanshan). During my stay, I encountered a number of foreign affairs activities visited by VIPs from the Middle East. As expected, there is a reason why these VIPs always choose to stay at OCT InterContinental. From the security team to the front desk reception, every member of the hotel looks like they have received meticulous, long-term, and efficient training. Their words and deeds are so "silky" and decent, and they are comfortable to look at;
❷. Regrets: It would be more perfect if the cocktails in the lounge had more varieties. Of course, it is already very good now. There is a "Bullfighting" made with coffee-based liquor, which once again highlights the theme of the hotel and is worthy of appreciation;
❸. Questions and Answers: A friend asked why Shanghai Greenland Marriott changed to an office building? A: Nowadays, all walks of life are in a fierce competition, including the automobile industry, the real estate industry, the hotel industry and the tourism industry. Today, the hotel market in mainland China has long entered the era of destocking, and there will be more and more cases of survival of the fittest. Hotels like OCT InterContinental, which have both internal and external cultivation, hard work in service, and the support of big trees, will naturally stand firm for a long time.

This is a very good parent-child resort hotel... I will make a reservation again in a few days so that I can play with my baby for a few more days... 🏖️⛱️✈️

There were many people but the staff was very compromising and very good in the arrangements. The breakfast was very good with many varieties. The swimming projects were excellent, not worse than the Macau Hotel. This hotel was formerly the Shenzhen Bay Hotel, and later InterContinental took over. It is a childhood memory for more than 30 years from childhood to adulthood. Now as a parent, I bring my children here to play, and I will continue to stay here in the future.

The facilities are not bad. The beach, indoor and outdoor swimming pools, and water children's playground meet the needs of children of different ages; there are also safety guards next to them to pay attention at all times. I missed the indoor swimming pool experience this time, I will go next time!
The service is good. At first, I was confused when multiple people added WeChat. Later, Hina said that one-to-one service was finally OK for her. At the same time, I also thank Miki for her service and timely reminders; such as the bubble pool in the water park and riding the small train.
Qiqu Utopia feels more suitable for younger children, and older ones are not very interested 😂
I don’t know if there were too many people that day, and there was a birthday party and a company event; it felt like there was no one to greet people in and out of the hotel, but there were receptionists at the entrance of other hotels.
Overall, the package is still cost-effective! I will come again in the future

Fortunately, Lcey from the Guest Relations Depar**ent was there to help (overall, I felt that she was the only one who took care of all the needs for two days and one night) 😅
It is recommended that guests add her on WeChat to make it more convenient and direct!

A hotel that costs more than 2,000 yuan a night doesn’t have an automatically heated toilet? And the breakfast is terrible. Children are charged more than 300 yuan per person. You heard it right, it’s the price of breakfast! It’s okay, I will pay this price, but please be more careful with your products, okay? You see, my child took a plate and said it was so unpalatable that he couldn’t finish it. The most terrible thing was that he had diarrhea after eating one of them. He rested until noon before leaving! The worst thing for me was that I chose this hotel over another five-star hotel! (The hotel has the same price, I won’t mention the name)! This review is probably my most detailed review! Only your hotel can make me evaluate it with my heart! It’s amazing

The overall furnishings and services of the hotel were good. Unfortunately, the water park train and carousel were not open at that time, so the children had nothing to do.
After reporting to the hotel, the hotel responded very promptly and immediately restored the train and water park to normal.
If the equipment needs to be repaired in the future, it would be better to inform the guests in advance when booking or checking in.
The buffet is good, the ingredients are good, and the service is also good. A one-stop place for small babies to take a walk

There is an independent children's toilet 🚾 projection animation, indoor and outdoor playgrounds, parent-child crafts, and children's evening makeup for children. The child's favorite thing is swimming. When he came back at night, he was still excited to run around in the room with a swimming ring. When checking out, he cried and refused to leave. The food quality is high. If there are more varieties of dinner buffets and steamed bread for children, it would be better. Wang Jun, the guest relations supervisor of the store, took the initiative to contact us to ask if we have any other needs and helped us solve them in time, which made this trip a perfect end. Very good!

The room was large and had a good sense of space. The hair dryer is very powerful, the internet is secure, and I have no problem viewing information from around the world.

There are many choices for breakfast, and there is also a dining counter dedicated to freshly squeezed juices, which is great! Although the charge for children is about 167 yuan per person on Qingming Festival, it is still a good experience to feed the fish after breakfast. The lady asked us to review the restaurant and gave us two small bags of fish food.

After feeding the fish, we went to the outdoor amusement facilities. The waiter said that the train ride was free on holidays. We also rode the carousel, which was so fun!

There were also many tourists swimming in the morning, both indoors and outdoors. It felt great. I didn’t bring a swimsuit with me on this trip. I hope I will bring a swimsuit with me next time.
It is recommended to choose this hotel if you have a loose budget.

There were too many customers for breakfast on Sunday, and the quality of the food dropped significantly. You had to wait for more than an hour to order a glass of orange juice. Some food (such as the desserts next to the coffee machine) was seen before 9 o'clock but was not served after 9 o'clock (breakfast until 10:30), and even witnessed guests yelling and cursing in the lobby for seating arrangements. If both are five-star hotels, the Nanhai Hilton is better. But the kids loved the beach pool, they had a great time.

It turns out that staying in Shenzhen during holidays can be so relaxing~ No traffic jams, no long-distance driving, very suitable for us~
The room is very good, and they helped us prepare baby bed fences, baby shower gel and toothbrushes (although we don’t have teeth yet, but it really reflects the hotel’s attentiveness~
The bathtub in the room is very large, and the family of three can play in the water together~
The buffet breakfast and dinner are very rich, and the desserts and foie gras on the table are very popular!
Key point💕: The children's play facilities provided by the hotel are simply a savior for parents! Our seven-month-old baby was fully entertained! The 2-year-old baby and his family decided to stay one more night to save the effort of thinking about where to take the baby!
👍Very satisfied!

This time, I traveled with my family and booked two three-day and two-night packages, including breakfast. The price-performance ratio is very high. The hotel is well-equipped, comfortable and clean. There are many breakfast varieties. Everyone enjoyed the meal. Next to it is the Splendid China Folk Village, which is also very good for taking children for a walk.
The beach is the highlight of the hotel, but the weather in April is still a bit cold and windy, so the children can't go into the water for long. I don't know why there is a coach lane in the indoor swimming pool, and the coach asked us guests to avoid it many times. The big sister in the swimming pool shower room also has good service. She took the initiative to hand over towels and ask if you need water.
The two rooms originally arranged were close to each other, which was convenient for children to visit. One room had a smell. After the change, the distance was very far, which was a little regrettable. Miki, who booked the room, provided very good service. He responded and solved any problems quickly. The overall feeling was still very good. It is worth coming again!

msg:The location is very good, between OCT and Splendid China
The hotel is very large and very suitable for families with children!
Children have fun digging in the sand and can also ride a small train. During the Chinese New Year, the outdoor part of Utopia is free.
Breakfast is divided into Chinese restaurant and Western restaurant. The Western restaurant has too many things. You may have to queue after 9 o'clock during the Chinese New Year period
The room is very nice, thank you very much hina for the reception. Highly recommended when bringing children~~

msg:It was so wise to choose the OCT InterContinental Hotel for the Spring Festival trip to Shenzhen. It has luxurious facilities, first-class service and high cost performance. It is worthy of being called the ceiling of Shenzhen parent-child hotels. The children had so much fun and their stay was unsatisfactory. I will choose this hotel again in the future. . The staff are very enthusiastic, especially the handsome concierge Naci and Li Wenwen. The service is very warm and welcoming. I give him a thumbs up!

The environment of the hotel is relatively good, the breakfast is quite rich, the juice and fruit coffee are quite good, and the rest can only be said to be okay. The hotel's train and beach pool are very comfortable and feel like a resort hotel. It was a little cold when we went there and almost no one was swimming. Overall it's pretty good.

msg:This is the second time I have stayed here during the Spring Festival. This time I checked in, I am very grateful and lucky to have HinaKan’s arrangements and services, which made people feel enthusiastic, warm and considerate... It was my birthday on the ***** calendar, and we also prepared decorations and birthday cakes 🎂 (not to mention that the cakes sent by the hotel were really very delicious)
[Parent-Child Activities] Our room was in Utopia (but there was a male employee at Utopia with a slightly lower emotional intelligence), and we participated in a craft class (again, we arrived at 11 o'clock. Fortunately, Hina checked in quickly and we caught up with the class). Spring Festival Activities, experienced small trains, sand digging, pool soaking and other activities... This is already very good in a city hotel
[Catering] After having buffet dinner and breakfast, the level of InterContinental has always been online. Most of the dinners are cooked to order, which is fresher than other buffets. There are more tables. In addition, many of the food delivery people who are supposed to be temporary helpers are not familiar with the table numbers, so they haven't eaten for a long time. Later, I met several people in white clothes who seemed to be relatively skilled and helped us solve the problem immediately. The whole service was considerate. The variety is also quite rich: eel sushi, lobster, freshly steamed scallops, grilled prawns... Desserts are also very good, and there are 3 pre-made desserts. Napoleon is super delicious (a small reminder: you can also feed goldfish at the entrance of the Western restaurant) )
[Room service] is relatively fast (under such a popular situation during the Spring Festival). For example, if someone vomits or a child eats and drops something on the carpet, it will be cleaned promptly.

The executive lounge manager Even immediately comforted and greeted me. At the same time, he immediately upgraded the room type when he saw me in the second area. In addition, WeChat has been added to indicate that you can contact us if you have any questions, which makes people feel warmer. To be honest, the hotel's facilities are a bit outdated at times, but the rooms are spacious and high-ceiling, and the room service is very enthusiastic and thoughtful, which makes up for all the troubles. It was very comfortable to stay for two consecutive nights. Due to travel arrangements, I didn’t get to experience the executive lounge. I will regret it when I come back next time!

I have stayed in more than 20 parent-child hotels and charged such a fee. Your little hotel does not have outdoor pools every day (no) (Open) There is no parent-child experience at the beach. I will not consider InterContinental again if I come to Shenzhen again.
The variety of breakfast is okay, but the service obviously cannot keep up with the foreign affairs reception for a few days. After nine o'clock, there are only a few pieces of bread.
The cleaning guy is very hardworking and diligent and delivers things in a timely manner.

The fruit in the hotel is very generous and fresh. It is also very quiet to stay. The view is wide. The breakfast buffet is pretty good, with both Chinese and Western food. You can see the pirate ship in the atrium from the room. There is also a small train in the atrium. Children like it very much.

msg:I can feel that the hotel management is very lax, the employees are lazy and indifferent, and the facilities are old. I am very disappointed and will never choose Intercontinental OCT again.

1: The room is very, very far from the elevator. There is only one elevator entrance on each floor. The detour makes you doubt your life. Especially at night, the floor is very scary and weird.
2: Many hotels can deliver food by robots or staff, and the attitude is very friendly and positive. However, this hotel cannot do it. If you want to order takeaway, you have to walk a very long way to get it yourself. The staff is indifferent and even orders it for your daughter in the middle of the night. I ordered some medicine and hoped that the hotel would bring it to me, but they were unwilling to do anything.
3: Various marketing claims that it is a "family hotel", and you need to pay a daily fee to watch a cartoon!
Even if you stay in a hotel at the amu*****t park, it will take you 398 a day.
4: Both the cleaning aunt and the luggage delivery boy had room key cards, and they opened the door for no reason twice (the first time I was cleaning in the morning, while I was still sleeping, the aunt opened the door directly, which scared me so much that I jumped out of bed. , the second time I sent a box, I felt very insecure)

It is recommended that if you don't come here to play in the summer, you really should not choose this hotel in other seasons. There are many choices at the same price and level near OCT, and the service is better than here, and the facilities are newer than here.

I will definitely choose this place again if I have the opportunity. I hope I can do it again next time. After experiencing such attentive service from Vivi, I really have to give her a thumbs up!

It was only around 1 o'clock when we arrived at the front desk, and we could go to the swimming pool to play in the water after taking the room card! Although the room will not be available until 3:30, but many people in summer can understand! The stored luggage will also help to take it to the room, very considerate!
The hotel's facilities are also very parent-child, and there is also a parent-child restaurant, where children can discharge while eating. The hotel room is also very big! This time I booked a deluxe room, the bathroom is very large, there is a terrace, and the view is very open, our room is facing the swimming pool, freehand and comfortable. During the summer vacation, the hotel has a lot of activities suitable for children, and the program is rich. This time, we only stayed for 1 day to experience them one by one. The children can't wait to say that they will come again.
Because the hotel's swimming pool, water park, and artificial beach make people forget to return, anyway, I am an adult who has a lot of fun and satisfaction! So I am very much looking forward to coming again next time! Will also recommend to friends!
This time, my children and I only tried the Chinese restaurant, one for lunch and one for dinner. The food in both times was very good, very suitable for our taste, and the service staff were very polite and thoughtful.
All in all, we are really satisfied with the whole trip!

Comfortable 👍 The hotel also gave me a cake during my birthday month. The breakfast buffet the next day was rich and delicious, with many choices. What I liked the most was how smooth their rice rolls were! After breakfast, we went to the long-awaited swimming pool, because their swimming pool has an artificial beach, which is really special. Children can play in the sand and swim, and there is also a small water park with slides. In short The kids had a great time. We were very satisfied with the two-day and one-night trip. We will stay here again next time😊

Thank you very much to Ms. Chen at the hotel desk for letting us get to the room early so that we can go swimming right away👍 There is a very large swimming pool and beach downstairs, which is very fun and can be used for a whole day. The breakfast is also quite special👍. My package includes a 300 yuan waterfall spa voucher. I checked the price on WeChat and made an appoin**ent to go there in the morning. The price has been adjusted (almost the same as in Hong Kong). Please note that there are additional service fees and taxes, which are different from those usually ordered through the app. I chose the more healthy Thai rice massage for 90 minutes. The process was really hot and I didn’t enjoy it very much, but I felt it had some effects. It would be great if this resort-like environment was used to heal the body and mind.

This time I stayed on the third floor, just saw Utopia's outdoor play facilities, the room is still clean, no smell. It's just that the facilities are a little bit old. There is a small terrace, it is not bad to sit here at dusk! There are many styles of buffet breakfast. I stayed for two days, and the style of buffet breakfast on the two days has changed, which is worthy of praise! There are also freshly squeezed fruit juices on the spot, instant Cantonese rice rolls, fresh honey, and even Spanish seafood baked rice! Three waterway slides have been added to the outdoor swimming pool, which can be played by adults and children, and the water shooting facilities are powerful enough to play water battles! The indoor and outdoor swimming pools and the beach are well maintained and adequate for swimmers! I missed the chance to use Utopia’s children’s facilities this time, my son is getting bigger, hahaha!

Let me talk about the problem, it makes people feel very uncomfortable
I booked the parent-child activity package 1588 through Ctrip payment. When I went to the hotel and said that the room was being confirmed, I asked myself to contact Ctrip. I heard from Ctrip that the price was different. Ctrip was communicating with Ctrip. After repeated communication with Ctrip, I finally refunded the activity package and Ctrip’s compensation coupon was renewed. After booking a room, it took nearly 3 hours to check in. No one in the hotel came forward to coordinate and solve the problem. If the customer is exposed, shouldn’t it be resolved between the hotel and Ctrip, so that the customer can solve the problem by themselves, and this is also the content price set by the hotel itself. It was still booked more than one day in advance, so why did it take so long. Feel like the store is bullying customers,
There are also some small details: there is no service staff to guide the room when checking in, etc.
Personally, I feel that the service does not match that of a five-star hotel⭐,

If you come early, there is no room, so you can go swimming first. The facilities in the changing room are very complete, and the children have enough time to play. Six hours of water ~ There are a lot of things to do nearby ~ But forget it on a hot day, the breakfast is very rich, but there are really many people on weekends! Going down at 9:30, there is still a long queue waiting to get a seat...

The breakfast is good, with a variety of varieties, and the freshly squeezed juice is very good.

Later, the hotel added WeChat and learned that it was a member of Ctrip and InterContinental, and then sent a welcome fruit to each room. The hotel is indeed very suitable for children. The happiest part of this trip is the children. I am very satisfied with the hotel's outdoor swimming pool.

There is no room when I check in at 12 o'clock. The front desk will notify me if there is a room, but no one contacted me in the end. Entering the room, the floor is so high, so I feel comfortable. Unfortunately, there is a small strand of hair on the ground in front of the toilet, which is very eye-catching. For the left, asking someone to clean up the hair seems exaggerated, and in the end I had to do it myself. I usually like to eat hotel breakfast, but the breakfast at the InterContinental Hotel is tasteless, and there is no ready-to-order egg station! The instant noodles only have clean vegetables and noodles, not even a beef ball and fish egg. There is no corn flakes, the only option is instant fruit juice and vegetable juice.

Even if the speech is not good, there is something worthy of praise. The bell boy at the door has a good service attitude. The indoor swimming pool needs to wear a swimming cap, but I don’t have one. The staff made a special trip to wear a swimming cap to the pool to match me. In addition, due to the child's birthday, the hotel sent a cake that was cheaper than mine. Zhong personally called me to ask me what time I needed to deliver it to the room. The time was right on time and the cake tasted good.

Generally speaking, the hotel is only 4.5 stars. This time, including breakfast, it costs almost $2000 a night. I think there should be better choices.

The only good environment is the so-called Children's Paradise, but the staff said that you can only go there if you are over 3 years old. Our baby is too young and we only took it for a visit. In addition, since it is an overwhelming parent-child marketing, why are the basic children's appliances so poor? How about crooked cribs with holes in them, gnawed cutlery, and forks with tooth marks? When eating breakfast, there are flies flying around? ? ? This price really does not meet the setting of a five-star hotel. Wouldn't it be nice to live in a folklore with good facilities at this price + Nairbao? Will not go a second time.

The children's playground is relatively small, and it is not cost-effective to buy it alone, but it is quite cost-effective to include it in the package.

I was lucky to have a bubble show today. Tricky Utopia is also very fun. I personally feel that the outdoors are more interesting than the indoors. The handicrafts and baking are also very good. I will check in next time when it is not raining! The baby was not feeling well at night. Manager Ryan and her colleagues helped with kindness. They were very heartwarming and touching. They will definitely bring the baby to play again next time!

The single bed was a 1.35 large single bed, which was very convenient for bringing my baby. The food in the executive lounge was very delicious, and you could have all three meals here. The service from the girls is also very good👍. The location of the hotel is very good. The subway is right outside the door. There are also rentals waiting at the entrance of the lobby at any time. It is very convenient to go anywhere. I left behind a beloved skirt when I left. On the night of returning to Beijing, Lucky added WeChat to help SF Express return to Beijing quickly. Thank you very much! I had a good impression of the InterContinental Hotel during this trip to Shenzhen, and I will definitely choose it here next time!

This time I brought children to Utopia on purpose, and booked the 3088 package. After arriving at the hotel, I was told that the Utopia Paradise and the Children’s Water Village were not open during the stay, but I confirmed with the hotel when I made the reservation that they would be open. People are very disappointed. As an old-fashioned professional hotel, the need for maintenance after May Day must not be a sudden decision. If it is not open, it should not be available for reservations when booking on the corresponding date. However, the hotel has upgraded the room with children's facilities, which can make up for the gap in the hearts of children.
Apart from this problem, the hotel is still worth staying in.

msg:Improvement: Hope to improve the health and fitness services. Guests who check out on the day cannot use it. But before I checked in, I didn't inform, nor did I give a solution (the yellow paper ring of the day has been collected). After checking out at noon that day, the children wanted to go to the swimming pool to play in the water because it was going to the airport until the afternoon, but because they needed to change their clothes, they went to the indoor fitness room (in fact, they just changed their swimsuits and washed them clean), but they were told that they could not use them. I have been to other hotels before and considering the check-out situation on the day, I will tell you what will happen if you still need to play on the day of check-out when you check in. In fact, there is not much additional cost increase for the hotel, but the experience will be much better, at least no guests need to find a way to bypass this rule.

Advantages: The overall experience is very good, and I used to travel with my colleagues. This time I specially brought my family and children together. From the check-in, hotel meals, room service, hotel entertainment, especially this time the Wuyi Hotel has many small programs permeated in the dining, children's playground, and swimming pool pirate ship situations, we can see the operator's intentions and seriousness. The order is also maintained during peak hours, and the clerks are more active in their work. The senior managers of the hotel can usually be seen greeting and serving guests on the front line. I will choose to stay next time, and see if the suggestions have been improved.

It also provides children's shower gel, children's slippers, and children's toothbrush, which is very friendly to families traveling with children. It would be even better if there are children's bathrobes. Another point is very worthy of praise. We had 4 bottles of drinking water in the room on the first day of our stay. After drinking, we refilled 9 bottles on the second day, and there were 2 bottles in the bathroom. For the first time, free drinking water was realized in a hotel. There are too many people in the outdoor swimming pool and water park, and the experience may be better if you come on a non-holiday. The room on the west side arranged for us by the front desk is too far to go to the swimming pool. It is recommended to live in the room on the east side, which is more convenient to go to the pool, beach and gym. The breakfast is average, too many people and too few food types, which does not meet the five-star experience.

Since it has been raining in Shenzhen, I didn’t want to go out, so I invited friends to have dinner in the coffee shop. I ordered steak, seafood salad, and pizza. It was really unpalatable, completely in line with the standard of a star hotel Nope, the steak was fried and placed on a cold plate, the pizza was completely hard, the seafood salad was so fishy, I almost spit it out at the first bite, and then asked the waiter for mayonnaise to barely eat it

msg:Thanks to vicky, who helped us arrange a room facing the beach with a garden view, as well as a fruit plate.
This experience is definitely a surprise. The room is large and the partitions are very comfortable. The bathroom has a large bathtub and children can take a bubble bath. The room also has a balcony where you can directly see the goldfish outside the restaurant.
What children like the most is the train and the beach. The sand on the beach is very fine and there are not many people. Parents lie on beach chairs and children dig sand, which is very comfortable.
The quality of breakfast is very good, and the bread and fruit are all fresh.

Service: The child called the front desk to ask for a pair of slippers, and the child's toothbrush, shower gel and slippers were very user-friendly🌝
Ready to stay again next week to play sand

The buffet has a lot of categories, and both mothers and babies eat well. The baby also took a small garden train, very excited. The weather is slightly cooler and not suitable for swimming. You can enjoy playing in the water again in summer. The room service is very considerate. Before check-in, the exclusive butler will contact you and prepare special toiletries and bed surrounds for the baby.

msg:This should be the worst InterContinental I have ever stayed in... First of all, the room rate, I think it is more than 1300 on Ctrip, let the family book it, it may be a scam of regular customers, I only know that we spent more than 1900 per night for the same room type ... We spent an extra 1,300 yuan for two nights, sorry! ! Secondly, when you check in, tell the front desk to give you a mini bar, but it’s really nothing, just two cans of carbonated drinks, one bottle of coconut milk, two cans of beer, not even a small snack, the front desk refused, no way! In fact, it is understandable not to give it away, but the tone is really tough. I feel that I am paying a high price to live in the most common room type. We are a family of three, and there are 4 bottles of water in the house. The 348ml small bottle is shown in Figure 1⃣️. I asked the cleaning staff to ask for two more bottles. Just say this broken pillow picture 2⃣️, can it sleep? I called the guest room and wanted two latex ones. It has been two hours now, and the pillows have not been delivered yet...there is also the so-called welcome fruit, picture 3⃣️, three, apples, bananas and pears, put them on this plate, your hotel is Isn't it too bad? What was particularly infuriating was that for two consecutive days, I hung the bath towel I brought on the doorknob, and the cleaner threw it in a ball on the countertop, and then hung up theirs! ! ! Picture 4⃣️ and Picture 5⃣️, I hung it up again the next day, and was thrown out and put on my bed again! ! ! What's the meaning? ? Taking the customer's things privately, did you use my bath towel to wipe the dust? Cleaned up? I dare not use it at all! ! ! The sound insulation is super bad, I tested it myself, the sound of water flushing upstairs at 2 o'clock in the middle of the night made it impossible to sleep at all! ! Why keep flushing? Because the toilet is not working well, there is no water! ! ! Because of the itinerary, I had no choice but to stay for two more nights (blame me for not having a long memory). I told the front desk that I didn't have breakfast in the first two days. Can I move to these two days, but I was mercilessly rejected. It's the kind that doesn't think about the customer at all, doesn't think about the problem from the customer's standpoint, and just blindly veto it! This hotel ranks relatively high in Shenzhen, and it is a parent-child hotel. I haven't experienced any parent-child hotels. I dare not say that it is a gift for children. At least children must have slippers and toothbrushes, right? Not to mention that the facilities in the house are old, the floor tiles look like they haven’t been cleaned up, and all aspects of wear and tear are serious. It is recommended that the hotel lower the price. As far as the environment is concerned, 400 a night is the most. Whoever comes to stay will be taken advantage of! ! ! Bad review Bad review Bad review! ! ! (The outlet doesn’t work, it can’t charge the electricity! The toilet doesn’t work, it can’t run water! The Wi-Fi doesn’t work, it’s better not to connect!)

The breakfast is quite satisfactory, but the children can feed the fish next to them after eating, leaving time for adults to drink coffee.
A small man-made beach in the garden pool makes children like it very much. The free small train is the highlight.

Because I didn’t stay for a long time, I didn’t expect it to be so caring. First of all, the process was very fast and I also gave welcome fruit , makes you feel at home, and secondly, I added Ava (guest relations) WeChat, asked a lot of questions, and responded very quickly, making you feel that there are familiar people in a strange place, and you can adapt quickly, and I am very thoughtful to help you arrange. Finally, due to the delay of the plane the next day, I need the hotel to help coordinate the check-out time, and I have made very very proper arrangements. I will definitely stay here next time when I come to Shenzhen;​​
Let’s talk about the hardware and software of the hotel. All aspects are very suitable for leisure and vacation. The surrounding environment is relatively quiet, and the hotel facilities are very comprehensive. There are hot springs, indoor and outdoor swimming pools, and beaches. If you have one to half a day, you can relax in the hotel , the surrounding Folk Village and Shenzhen Bay Park and other scenic spots are not far away, very suitable for bringing children;​​
Children: Take the children to feed the fish, dig sand by the sea, soak in the hot springs, the hotel has free parking, and adults can swim and take a bubble bath, which is also very comfortable; five-star praise~ I will stay again next time~

msg:The overall feeling is good, the room is open and bright, Echo, the customer service specialist, added me on WeChat, confirmed the requirements for the room in advance, and everything was prepared in advance according to my requirements, especially the bed guards for children to prevent them from falling off. Specially prepared a set of children's toiletries, a big thumbs up!
The bedding and bath towels are very skin-friendly, and the stay is very comfortable. I really like the oversized bathtub. The view outside the window is also very good, there is an outdoor swimming pool, but it is a pity that it is raining and there is no way to go swimming.
I would also like to offer some suggestions, hope it will get better and better:
1. The quilt is a bit thick, and the temperature in Shenzhen is high (in January, the temperature was around 18 degrees, and the air conditioner was not turned on, so I was woken up several times by the heat at night)
2. All TVs require membership, and there is no way to watch them. Such a high-end hotel should offer membership
3. The Bosh speaker is good, but it’s a pity that I can’t use it. I haven’t turned it on for a long time. It would be better if it can be operated easily.
4. There is no breakfast. If you add breakfast, it will cost more than 200 per person, which is inconvenient

The facilities are comprehensive in all aspects, very suitable for parents and children. But maybe the hotel is relatively old, the bed is uncomfortable, the toilet is separated from wet and dry, and the toilet location is a bit narrow. The water pressure of the shower head is not enough. I don't know if it's because of the large number of people during the holidays or what. The hygiene of the suite room is not very clean. Maybe staying in the off-season can experience the original five-star service.

msg:Although I hesitated for a long time about which hotel to stay in Shenzhen during the Spring Festival, it was difficult to choose between St. Regis and InterContinental. Later, I realized that I was a Platinum member of InterContinental, and finally chose InterContinental. The experience of staying this time made me feel that I had to choose is rightly worth it.
The hotel rooms are spacious and bright. Although it is winter, they are very warm. The front is the garden swimming pool, and you can overlook the sea in the distance. The scenery is relaxing.
The big bed in the room is soft, and it fits the waist very well when lying on it. The quilt is a bit thick in winter. The design of the bathtub is also very distinctive.
Of course, every time you stay in a hotel, the difference in room hardware between five-star hotels will not be too great. The most important thing about InterContinental this time is the service reception, which is worthy of praise. The service reception and temperament image of the front office manager Alan are the best for the hotel and customer service. To add luster, he will listen carefully to the guests' ideas and suggestions, and more importantly, Alan's service attitude is upright but not hard. It makes people feel like a spring breeze. All the speeches are communicated from the standpoint of the guests. It is rare to meet a boy who can do such a good service and is perfectly qualified for the responsibility and responsibility of the fire captain. On New Year's Eve, we also brought melon seeds, peanut candies and other essentials for the Spring Festival, which made tourists stay in hotels and felt like they were at home for the New Year. So these details have enhanced the travel experience this time.

1. The location is good, Window of the World and Splendid China are within walking distance. Happy Coast and Happy Valley are also very close, and it is also convenient to go to Happy Harbor.
2. The breakfast time is generous and rich. 6:30-10:30 The time is friendly, the meals are rich, and children and the elderly can be taken care of.
3. The room is large and the facilities are complete. The room is very large, with a special dressing room, water bar, children's pedals, children's toothbrushes, children's shampoo, slippers are all available, the bed circumference is matched with the hotel immediately after talking with the hotel, the bathtub is large, and the room has a balcony. Very comfortable.
4. The environment is good. The hotel has a lot of fish just outside the restaurant door, you can feed the fish to play, there is also a small train in the hotel, there is a sand play area, the weather is definitely more comfortable if it is hotter.
5. Insufficient words: The restaurant area is a bit small, and when there are many people, you have to wait for a seat after 9 o'clock. The extra-large bed room is made up of two 1.2-meter beds, and it is a bit uncomfortable to sleep with a gap in the middle. The bathtub is large, but it is not convenient to drain and drain the water. The bath salt is a bit far away, so I didn't see it if I didn't pay attention. The water in the rain is hot and cold. This is the problem in both of our rooms. If you take a shower upstairs, the water pipes in the bathroom will hum very loudly.
Overall it's a good experience, recommended.

msg:Check-in: The concierge brother and the receptionist brother are warm and thoughtful. Because I have two children, the front desk brother recommends choosing a room near the elevator. It is actually measured that the location is easy to enter and exit without disturbing other tenants too much. The children come and go freely without getting lost, which is especially good. Since then, a new way of room selection has been opened.
I invited friends to vacation together, so I chose the OCT InterContinental in the city center. My friends arrived late, and they are also a family with a baby. The room I arranged for the first night was noisy due to the air-conditioning fan, but it was much better when I changed the room for the second night. Hope to pay more attention to the order remarks information next time.
Room: The room is large and comfortable. Although the floor is not high, you can see the swimming pool. The children are very happy.
Facilities: The children's playground is not open yet, and the children are a little disappointed. But the indoor swimming pool is too comfortable, especially the super jacuzzi.
Others: If you bring a baby, there are no ducks in the bathtub, children's bathtubs, and children's body lotion. It would be best if the hotel can prepare some.
Highlights: Ms. Gina's customer service is sweet. I hope that I can also remember the little brother who helped me check in even better. Will be back at Easter.

msg:After a few years, I stayed at the InterContinental Hotel in Shenzhen OCT. I remember that the company held an annual meeting 8 years ago, and the team stayed there. I am very impressed with the quiet location in the midst of the hustle and bustle, the extremely luxurious environment, and the super five-star service. It was also that time that I joined the hotel membership system. This time I just came to Shenzhen for business, so I still thought of the hotel. Sure enough, I was not disappointed. Although the hotel has been a few years old, it does not affect my liking for it. The services of Echo and Janet can be said to be caring and considerate. The breakfast is very good👍, I will stay again next time!

A little disappointed in hygiene. As an Intercontinental Hotel, the sanitation details of the room are not in place. The corners of the shower room and toilet are not very hygienic. I personally have high requirements for hygienic details, and it is easier to find problems with these details.
The overall environment of OCT is still very good, and it is convenient to travel around. It is very convenient to walk to Tsuta Mountain to eat.
The service is still OK, and all aspects of children's products are provided, so the overall experience of bringing children to stay is still good.

Hygiene: The room is clean, the carpets are new, and the water quality of the outdoor swimming pool is good.

Environment: The garden environment is very good, the outdoor swimming pool is very large, there is a real sand beach, and the folk culture village next door.

Service: Butler service, there will be a butler adding WeChat before check-in to ask about the needs, my housekeeper Echo is very good, all the requirements before check-in are met, the arrangement is very appropriate, and he also takes the initiative to help upgrade the room. The service after check-in is also very meticulous, and finally helped to apply for a late check-out.
Nucleic acid testing points are arranged in the hotel every day, which is very convenient and user-friendly.

msg:1006 Check in. Most of the people who come to stay here are parent-child tours, and there is quite a market for parent-child theme hotels, especially for local tours under the epidemic.
[Advantages] In the urban area, the transportation is convenient. Big room, big bathroom, big bathtub. The light switch in the house is more reasonable and convenient. The beach is very close to the room, there are reclining chairs and shade trees, and there are places for people like me who don't like to go into the water. The water is clean. InterContinental members have late check-out until 14:00. There is an exclusive customer service Jaen docking, the child missed the pay TV and helped to avoid it.
[Inadequate] Room 2115, the left bose speaker has no sound. In addition, it would be great if it could connect to Bluetooth, it should be an older model, this time it is only used for TV. The bathtub 🛁 is very big and cool, but it will continue to leak (the water outlet has been closed), and the small TV next to it is turned on and the blue screen has no content. The pillow is not very comfortable, it shrunk down, inelastic and difficult to shape. All the trash cans in the room are not covered with plastic bags. Although I don't need to clean them, I always feel that if there is wet garbage, it will be more difficult to clean up, so I have some scruples psychologically.

msg:I just came back from the hotel, I feel good, the children are very happy, the outdoor swimming pool, water facilities, and artificial beaches are all loved by children. In summer, playing in the water is indispensable. Although it is in the city center, it really feels like being at the seaside. Children, this is a good hotel, suitable for parents and children. The breakfast is very rich and the taste is online. This is a Spanish-style hotel. The welcome guests at the door are dressed as cowboys. There are Spanish red and bullfighting elements everywhere. The hotel is close to the sea world. , Splendid China, not far from the Happy Coast, it is very convenient to go anywhere, the room is big enough, and the bedding is very comfortable. In short, the facilities are five-star and match the price, but as an old Ctrip user, I haven't paid the deposit for a long time. Yes, this time, the deposit is 1000 yuan, and it will take some time for the check-out to be returned. Maybe each hotel has a different deposit system and requires children's documents. You can prepare it in advance and inform the service staff that there is a parking demand. The service staff did not prompt you to Where to scan the code to register the license plate number, small flaws, the staff are very polite, everyone will say hello politely, in line with the five-star standard, next time you need to bring children,

2. When you arrive at the hotel, there will be handsome guys and beauties dressed as cowboys to help with luggage
3. The hotel is very suitable for parent-child play. There are water slides, indoor and outdoor swimming pools, and indoor small hot springs? The small artificial beach sand is very fine. But the shallow area of the swimming pool in the city is a bit small, it would be nice if it could be bigger
4. When you leave, you will also arrange to help collect your luggage
The service is very good, the experience is very good, and I will come to play when I have time

As soon as they arrived at the hotel, the children went straight to the water park. They experienced various projects one by one until the park was closed, and they had a great time. After breakfast the next day, they continued to play in the park until the check-out time, and finally left the hotel reluctantly. Special thanks to Gina, for contacting and arranging needs before check-in, actively coordinating the problems during check-in, and helping us to upgrade the room type. Although she had not seen me after get off work when checking in, I believe she must be a kind-hearted person girl 🌹

The attitude is very indifferent, and I have already told her that the trouble is hurry. The child is going to take a nap. She is still playing with her mobile phone, and it is very slow. To be honest, this service is not worthy of this five-star hotel. We stand at the front desk and feel nothing to be welcomed. The front desk is called Yuki Wu Wenfang. She also said that she is a manager. Should a manager be so arrogant? I'm really a little angry, it affects the mood of the vacation, I hope I won't run into such a person again next time I stay here

msg:The geographical position is superior, it is sandwiched between Splendid China and the Window of the World. It is a rare five-star hotel in a quiet city. I've always passed by before, this is the first time to take my children to stay here, I didn't expect the hotel's outdoor beach and indoor swimming pool to be so great! Very suitable for family travel. Half an hour from home to the hotel car park, pretending to be at the seaside, the children had a great time!

I would like to highlight the excellent service of the hotel, especially the guest relations specialist Jaen, who understood my room needs before check-in (helped me reserve a room that I liked very much), to the various demands of the check-in room (help me contact the robot for delivery) Medicine, take the initiative to send mosquito killers, late check-out), and the care after check-out is meticulous. It is the most satisfying time I have stayed in the hotel so many times, and it feels warmer than those mainly parent-child hotels.

The cafe downstairs is also very good, because I left my satchel there. When I found it, they had already found the mobile phone number of my friend who was shopping there and told me that they had picked up my bag. I immediately went to the front desk to retrieve it, and carefully checked the correctness of the contents of the bag when I retrieved it.

The hotel room is also unexpectedly large. I originally thought that five-star hotels in the city would want to be smaller, but I didn't expect that they all have a very spacious bedroom + bathroom + cloakroom, and even put down a leisure sofa is more than enough. My room is facing the pool view. . Also has a balcony. In short, it is a hotel with very good service software + facilities and hardware. I will come again and recommend it to my friends. Thank you!

The room is very large, with a very large bathtub and a large balcony. The balcony has a beautiful view and is very comfortable. The room is fully equipped, although it is a pity that the TV is a bit small and cannot be projected. But overall the room is still very satisfied, the overall feeling is very comfortable.
The hotel has two swimming pools. The outdoor swimming pool is 1.4 meters, which is very large. There is also a beach and shallow water area. The children are very happy. The indoor swimming pool should be 25 meters, and there are children's pools and hot spring pools on the side. Although there should be a lot of people staying in the hotel, because the swimming pool is large, it will not feel crowded, and it should be very comfortable to swim. I took my baby to play in the indoor and outdoor pools for a while.
The hotel itinerary was still very happy, and both babies said they would come to stay. But I still have two opinions: one is that Ctrip wrote that the delayed check-out will be delayed until 2:00, but the hotel did not accept it. Later, it was said that the delay was due to the help of the members; the other is that the decoration of the hotel room is relatively old, and now it is obviously biased. In the direction of the parent-child hotel, some decorative paintings in the room are really not suitable for children to see. They even feel terrible when they see it at night. I didn't pay attention to it. The painting will not be put up. I also feel a little scary when I see it. I hope the hotel will pay attention to making changes to the room decoration paintings.

Disadvantages: the hotel equipment is relatively old; the management is a little confusing, the room has not been cleaned when checking in at three o'clock, and the room can only be entered at four o'clock. The kung fu tea set has to be rented for 200 yuan a day. The hotel, especially the service staff at the front desk and the outdoor swimming pool, has a bad attitude. Compared with the Intercontinental hotels in other cities, the experience is not good. During the May 1st period, parent-child interaction classes will also cost money. If you want to go to a parent-child hotel in the future, there are still many aspects that need to be strengthened, including hardware facilities. Apart from the swimming pool, there are no other places for children to play in the hotel, such as playgrounds or children's playgrounds. , children's bathrobes are also not. I don't know if it's because of the crowd during the May Day that the experience is not good or if it's 2000 yuan a night I really don't think it's worth it

My sister Nicole, who was an intern at the front desk, was very nice. With sugar water, the facilities at InterContinental are also very suitable for parent-child travel. It takes five minutes to drive away from home without having to toss on the road.

msg:This is a hotel where we locals in Shenzhen like to go on weekends for vacation. On weekends, we take our children and pretend to go on vacation in an urban hotel in Sanya. The location of the hotel is very good. Baoan can be reached by car in the past half an hour. Although it is in the urban area, it is quiet in the middle of the city. There are many restaurants to choose from, such as high-quality Japanese food in OCT, within five kilometers by car. Go to Baishizhou for supper. The quality of the beach is high, and the pool view room has a wide view. The children will never forget it when they come back. Although the hotel has been open for a certain number of years, the overall hardware of the hotel is still well maintained, which does not affect the experience at all. The service of the hotel is also very good. Thank you Xiao He for upgrading us to an executive room. The shower cap that fell off quickly when I came back was also sent back to me as soon as possible, which is very considerate!

msg:Needless to say, the hotel facilities, the InterContinental brand says it all. You don’t need him because he is InterContinental, and if he is not good, you can’t be InterContinental, you know. What I want to talk about is the service, the service here is meticulous, and he will do it if you think about it. Greetings in the morning and evening, welcome fruit, etc. are not a matter. From booking Angelica[玫瑰][玫瑰], add me on WeChat, from room hobbies to all kinds of warm reminders, one can't be less. That's all right, some hotels will also ask you what you need, and you will refuse you on the grounds of large number of guests, tight rooms, etc. Sometimes I wonder, why bother, comrade, why bother, asking if you can’t make it difficult for guests? Anyway, Angelica[玫瑰][玫瑰] satisfies all your needs and also tracks the service after checking out. I feel that this kind of service is called true service, sincere! Next time you live, you must!

msg:Experience the number one parent-child hotel in Shenzhen. I thought it was relying on the package of the Splendid China Scenic Spot, but I never thought that the children’s amu*****t system in the hotel is a self-contained system...Small trains, pirate ships, goldfish ponds, swimming pools, artificial beaches and other facilities for fun, Tightly lock the small and small innocence, unknowingly the loss of time... "The peace of mind is the way, the outing is not the mountain", the outdoor environment is beautiful, the city is quiet...

The hotel has complete facilities and novel decoration. The room is clean and tidy. The leisure stool outside the balcony of the room is so clean that there is no dust. The Simmons bed is very comfortable to sleep, but it is a lot higher than normal. I am a little worried about whether the child will Falling down; the buffet is rich and delicious, but the pickles are far away from the place where the noodles are made; the symbol of 🐃 is everywhere, which may bring good luck to people in the capital market...

On New Year’s Eve, there are many guests, which is exactly when a hotel’s ability test is verified... Thanks to the lobby manager for giving the children chocolates and fruits, and also to the beautiful Qiu Yuting who checked in. Not only did she help upgrade the room, she also provided uninterrupted butler service. ", to provide children with children’s toiletries, pajamas, shoes, towels, drinking water, cribs, etc., busy late into the night... Thank you very much 🙏 beautiful Qiu Yuting and other colleagues who assisted... When leaving the hotel, thank you handsome Hu Kaidong Provided snacks for the children in time...

I am very satisfied with the hotel's hardware and software services. This time, I will give a special praise of seven stars (Ctrip can only give five stars here). Bringing a baby will feel that the price/performance ratio is super high...

Find a hotel near home to accompany your wife and children. The best place to play on the beach and water in the city is Intercontinental. The rooms are big enough and facilities. And the decoration is a bit old, some places are damaged, fitness swimming and dining are good, the children are very happy, and the bread I bought is used to feed the fish 😂 Thank you Hina for helping us with the late check-out, so that the children can play more After a while, the pool went back to the room to take a shower. Overall, it was good. I just want to complain about two points: 1. The security service of the parking lot needs to be strengthened. 2. There are ants on the balcony of the room. Children will be bitten if they play on the balcony. .

There are relatively few people who go there on working days. good environment.
Along the way, Betty from the concierge depar**ent helps with luggage, add WeChat, will send breakfast time, beach location, and the opening time of the small train. (Cookies can be requested from her, the chef made them, because the cookies in the room are charged)

The room environment is very good, clean and hygienic.
I was stunned by the place where I took a bath. The water outlet was so big that it quickly filled the oversized bathtub.
The breakfast buffet is rich, delicious and varied.
You can self-feed the fish outside of breakfast. You can get fish feed. Don’t throw away bread or anything. There is no clear fee for fish feed, so please enjoy it.
The sand on the beach is also very fine and soft, white, without the salty taste of the beach.
Relatively clean, the water is clear and cold.
However, there are still strong people swimming.

Was here for the first time and was pleasantly surprised. The price is very good.
Finally, thank you Betty for your excellent service.

Before check-in, the guest relations manager maxine added WeChat and asked me if I have any special check-in requirements. I asked for a twin bed, quiet, close to the outdoor swimming pool, and good views. In the end, it was all satisfied. Haha.
The room on the side of the west wing is larger than the main building and has a large balcony with a view. It is super quiet and all facilities in the room are well maintained. I really like such a large bathroom. In addition to the vanity table, the dressing table has a large mirror and the bathroom door There is also a huge mirror behind it, which is perfect for makeup and changing clothes haha. Provide email to register new VIP and give away fruit sparkling water chocolate, but the fruit is not fresh.
The outdoor swimming pool that the kids love to play is also great, the area is big enough, there are slides, and there is a bubble show from 4:30 to 5 in the afternoon. They have a great time, but the artificial beach is a bit crowded, so I didn't go in.

🚗 Transportation: Going out is the Window of the World, Happy Valley and other attractions, the transportation should not be too convenient. The location is just beside Shennan Avenue.
🧹 Hygiene: There is nothing to fault.
🍃Environment: The green rate is high, there are beach swimming pools, koi ponds, and I like the terrace of the room too much. At night, you can blow a hair on the terrace to chat, drink, and drink. Don't be too freehand.
🔔Service: The waiters are very professional and patiently answer questions. After checking out, I found that I forgot to take the data cable. Fortunately, Miss Zhang Yiying, the service ambassador, helped to retrieve it. Thank you very much.

I knew that I booked directly at the agreed price of the unit. The front desk had a bad attitude. A family of three came to the store and asked me if I booked a twin room? ? The tone of interrogation and questioning has been used all the time, which is very uncomfortable. You can simply say that it is not necessary to use it. 3 stars for having a lobby and pool with nice staff. It is not recommended for parents and children, just watch a few fish, there is nothing fun, and it will be more boring if it rains. The Crowne Plaza will also have a children's swimming pool the next day, so go directly to the Children's Paradise in Vientiane World.

msg:I visited InterContinental in OCT a few years ago. I had a good impression at the time, so I chose this place when I came to Shenzhen this time.
But the feeling this time is not so good. Let me talk about the first one: the first day I checked into the hotel and ordered milk tea. I thought I could deliver it upstairs by a robot. After an hour later, the concierge called and said that it could not be delivered due to the epidemic, and asked me to go downstairs to pick it up. The point is here. The next day I ordered milk tea again, but due to the rain, my courier was late, so I went to the nearby Hong Kong University Hospital to get a nucleic acid report. When I was not in the room, I asked my brother to put it in the concierge depar**ent. . Let him run to the parking lot and put it in the express locker. I called the concierge and said that I had not let it go. Later, when I returned to the hotel, I saw that there were several takeaway bags in the concierge depar**ent. I was angry at that time. It was not because I was not allowed to put them, but because I felt responsible for speaking and the standards were not uniform. The other thing is the Chinese restaurant. We ate three meals there. The soup we ordered on the third meal contained bugs. As a result, the waiter waived the soup at the checkout, and did not take the initiative to apologize. He received 6%. Taxes, and additional service charges, this is the attitude, I think it is not the service of a star hotel.

🧹Hygienic: clean and tidy, even in public areas such as swimming pools, beaches, and restaurants, the waiters are very active in cleaning them, plus what Shenzhen people know: if trash does not fall, Shenzhen is more beautiful.
🍃Environment:
The room is a 55-square-meter big bed room, with a strong sense of space and a large bathtub, which is especially suitable for bringing children here. I have soaked twice. Open the balcony, a piece of lush woods, the natural oxygen bar has a sense of sight, sitting on the sofa on the balcony to see the green plants, refreshing and happy. .
Beach swimming pool: staying in a hotel in the city can also feel like traveling to the beach. Looking at Shenzhen, this is the only one. The sand is fine, without the graininess of the seaside beach, which is more suitable for children. Sand digging and swimming are simply a children’s paradise. The breakfast shop is no longer eating. I drove me all the way to play. There are many lounge chairs for adults to rest on the beach, with umbrellas and sun protection. Look at the baby, take a selfie.
🔔Service: This time it is a one-to-one service. Xi Xi who serves me, a beautiful expectant mother who is pregnant with Liujia, is careful and meticulous. She confirms the time and the number of people in advance with me. She understands that there are children, and she is ready in the room. Children's toothbrush, toothpaste, bathrobes and slippers; I personally received them upon check-in and took us to the elevator door, which was really touched.

In short, if you stay in deep, I would prefer Intercontinental; with a baby, leisure is both right.
The children kept saying on the way home, Mom, I still want to stay in this hotel.

msg:This is not the first time I have stayed at Intercontinental. The service is quite good. This is relatively old. When checking in, the customer service said that there are many people on the weekend and cannot check out late. It was a bit sad. It was really clear in the morning when I checked out. After playing for a long time, the customer service at the front desk said that it’s okay to check out until 2 o’clock in the afternoon. The only thing that disappointed me was that the shower in the room was hot and cold. The experience was poor and I hope to improve!

The room is very bright, especially the bathtub in the bathroom, soaking up super cool. In short, it looks like a new hotel.
The location of the hotel is superior, surrounded by well-known attractions, and you don’t want to stay in the hotel. It is also the best choice to go to the nearby attractions.
Needless to say about service and hygiene, the front desk service is meticulous and patient, and the water in the swimming pool is also very clean. It doesn't hurt to enter the eyes.

The person was very gentle and attentive and would tell us where the specific amu*****t facilities are. I brought the kids and helped me arrange the elevator closest to the swimming pool, which is very convenient! I especially like OCT Intercontinental. Parents and children are the mainstay of their home. The environment is also very good, the service is good, and I love it.

I also took the initiative to inform me that my room rate actually includes breakfast for two large and one small. There were four bottles of drinking water in the room, and two more bottles were requested. The room service staff sent five bottles over. The child had a lunch break and asked for a late check-out. They also agreed to be delayed until two. The breakfast is plentiful and the service is also meticulous and attentive.

msg:The room was very noisy. It felt like someone was shooting basketball upstairs, and there was the sound of moving tables and closing doors or other various intermittent noises. I called the room service center and they sent someone to look at it, but they didn't communicate any information at all. I repeated it to him again, but it didn't solve the problem. They said to find someone to look at it again, and then called the room service center. It didn't solve the problem, let me repeat it again, until I was angry, I said I should change your room, but I didn't act. Later, I complained to Ctrip customer service. After Ctrip helped to contact me, the female duty manager came to contact me that day and said that she would send someone to see it. She said that there was no noise upstairs and downstairs. I said that you sent someone to see it, but she refused to admit it I know that some people have seen it, the management is extremely chaotic, and I deny the existence of noise, mess around and shirk responsibility, is it my responsibility for the chaos of internal management? ? ? It is obvious that the first person to see it was assigned a work order, how can there be no record? The noise continued to be disturbed by the inaction of several management staff, and there was no sleepiness at all. I went to have breakfast and was asked 3 times, be sure to check my room number. I checked it when I went in, but it was a waste of time to solve the problem. Later, the hotel's solution was to extend the stay for 2 hours. It did not admit that it was seen by someone, and it did not admit that there was noise. It did not give other solutions, and did not even change rooms. Then I went back to the room in the afternoon and it was still very noisy. In the 10 minutes I complained to Ctrip's customer service, I made 5 recordings of 5 times. If the hotel replied that there was no noise, please listen and stop quibbling. Yesterday afternoon, I asked the customer service to send a spoon and chopsticks to the room. I called the concierge 7 or 8 times and no one answered. The food and beverage depar**ent called 4 or 5 times before someone answered. I pressed 0 many times and went around. Two depar**ents, the service is so bad that there is no one...

🚗 Transportation: The transportation is very convenient. You can feel the sunny beach in the city within 15 minutes! For babies who cannot travel due to the epidemic, it can be regarded as a solution to greed!

🍃Environment: InterContinental's unique artificial beach is the biggest feature. The pool and beach water are clean, there are slides, mushroom fountains, and bubble parties on weekends, all of which are children's paradise! !

🧹Hygienic: The hotel room is also very clean, and there is an extra-large two-meter bed, so children can roll on the bed without fear of falling off!

🔔Service: Since it is also a veteran hotel, the food delivery service is particularly perfect. You can have food when you are hungry 24 hours a day, and the taste is good! In the morning, I ordered a Chinese breakfast of 188, which is enough for 3 people. It saves the breakfast buffet for 200 people. Isn't it fragrant? ? You can also write it on the card at night, make an appoin**ent and send it to the room directly in the morning, comfortable!

As a Shenzhen native, it is the first time to stay at InterContinental. I am very satisfied with the experience. I can come here often 👏🏻👏🏻

msg:Bring two children over to play on the beach. Overall, I was very satisfied. The service staff were very polite and enthusiastic, especially Calvin at the front desk. He contacted me on WeChat in advance to confirm the itinerary and room type. The advantage of the hotel is that there are beaches and many swimming pools for children, suitable for children of all ages to play in the water, which is rare in urban hotels. The public environment is clean, comfortable and pleasing to the eye. The standard of Chinese restaurant dishes is good. The disadvantages are: 1 except for the indoor swimming pool, there are no indoor playgrounds and other children's play items, basically all the time can only be played outdoors; 2 the balcony of the room does not have a drying rack; 3 the bar can not be individually controlled on and off, so we have to give it to us at night The residents of the baby foaming milk find it inconvenient, so they can only turn on the mobile phone to illuminate it. In addition, I feel that there are not as many types of breakfast as InterContinental Hotels in Dameisha. Overall it is worth it and will go again.

On the day of check-in, I just wanted to boil a hot water to drink. The good guy almost vomited when I opened the kettle. What girls tie their hair, facial cleansers and other things are in it. I wonder if this hotel has cleaned the room. Yeah, I'm speechless

Let me talk about what happened in the past two days. I want to say that I confirmed that I stayed at InterContinental for one night from July 5th to July 6th. After checking out, the original points were indeed given to me, but a strange thing happened yesterday. It's not something normal people do. My points were deducted more than 3,000 points for no reason on the 11th day. After calling the member center many times to complain and inquire, I learned that the hotel notified the member center by email saying that I didn't have it on that day. I checked in and got my own consent to make a point adjus**ent. I checked in normally and checked out at the normal front desk. The hotel did not contact me by phone. I just wanted to know where the hotel came from to ask for my consent.

For example, there are no children's amu*****t facilities except for the beach, and the beach can only be played when it is hot. , there is no equipment on the beach. I came here three times, three times, the whole family lived in four rooms, and the distance between the rooms was also very far. In addition, every time I had breakfast, I was arranged in a small restaurant, a reserved place for the large restaurant. , I watched it at 10:30 and it was only reserved, that is, wasting resources and not using it on the guests at all. The most annoying thing is that the charging piles are all provided by Porsche. I have no expense to arrange the installation of such general-purpose charging piles. The only 8 general-purpose charging piles on the G floor of the West Wing parking lot are occupied by hotel cars and blue-brand cars. , I called the front desk to help coordinate, the hotel front desk said that the coordination could not come out, and said it was reserved, so why should I reserve an electric parking space, or four blue-brand cars! I called three times before and after, but no result, very angry, my suggestion is that if you spend this money to stay in a hotel, you will enjoy the service, it is not worth it!

msg:The environment and hardware are very good. It is very rare to have its own exclusive beach and large outdoor swimming pool in the urban area, so there is no need to block the road in Dameisha. The service has a perfect experience of being at home and feeling like a spring breeze. In addition, I would like to thank the housekeeper, Akai, for presenting cakes to the children. There are also Happy Valley Window of the World, Splendid China and Happy Coast, which can be said to be the most suitable hotel for family trips in Shenzhen.

msg:Very poor service hotel!
1. During the epidemic period, the young ladies and sisters who came in groups in groups at night were unexpectedly unattended. Did you buy the night doorman?
2. The security guard at the gate at night is irresponsible at all, ignoring the risk of the epidemic and checking the guests at will. Some catch up and check it at will, and some don't. Living in a hotel is very insecure!
3. The service is very poor, the guests are damaged due to hotel reasons, and they do not help, and they are indifferent. I have repeatedly asked for help with the concierge to get a bag to store the scattered things on the floor. The result is still ignored, standing opposite to watch! The quality is too poor! This kind of staff shouldn't be in a five-star hotel! Below is the video to prove it!
4. Stay for two days, every day at ten o'clock in the morning, electric drills and hammers are used for various construction and percussion operations. Woke up for two days! After 40 minutes, the sound of the electric drill is over! I'm just wondering, can't the construction work after 11 o'clock? Can't let the guests sleep in?
5. Remind hotel guests to bring their own pillows. I slept for two days with cervical spondylosis. The hotel pillows are extremely uncomfortable! I don't know where to buy cheap black cotton. Other five-star hotel pillows are much stronger in terms of support and softness.
6. Very poor hygiene! There is also a bottle of mineral water full of cigarette butts in the corner of the balcony! I wanted to go to the balcony to get some air! When I saw these, I felt so dirty, like I went to the toilet!
7. After the security guard was complained by me, a manager on duty in the lobby politely stopped the security guard's rude behavior, and said that he would respond to his leader and ask him to apologize to me in person. Until I left the hotel, I never saw the hotel here. A savage and incompetent person apologizes for admitting his mistake.
8. I was originally a member of InterContinental and a senior member of Ctrip. Those hotel salesmen don’t always think of using moral kidnapping to get guests to give you a 5-star full score on Ctrip! Complete your fake performance and deceptive reviews! You should let the hotel-related depar**ents improve their professional quality and education! Dogs also need to be trained to avoid hurting people, not to mention the people who keep the house? Don't take responsibility for your own work! Are you polite?
I like the brand InterContinental very much. I just registered as a member. I didn't expect that the InterContinental Hotel in Shenzhen is so bad! Compared with other cities intercontinental far! It really doesn't deserve such a high rating!
Bullying! unreasonable! no quality! Inequality! Unhygienic! noisy! cheat! Not to mention impolite... This is my personal experience of staying at the InterContinental Shenzhen OCT! The first experience in my life! It really works!
This is also the first time I have written such a long review on Ctrip. I hope everyone can protect themselves during the epidemic. The choice is very important, and don’t always read the reviews written by the hotel. See the real side!

msg:The decoration of the hotel is slightly tired, but the overall architectural pattern can be seen in the style of the year. Staying in the preferred suite, the red carpet on the floor in the room feels too exaggerated, and the combination of European-style sofa and coffee table cannot bring a relaxing and pleasant vacation. It is unreasonable that the cloakroom has a dressing table but no mirror. The bed is too high for Asians. The extra details are the toto smart toilet and the floor hanger in the living room. The toiletries are L’Occitane, nothing has been done. What I want to complain about is the breakfast service, the taste is average, the Chinese style is acceptable, the bread and pastry Japanese ingredients can be skipped, the staff is indifferent, one of them responded when I asked him for a glass of warm water for the baby and asked me to pick it up at the tap or Ask the staff at the bar upstairs. No matter, this trip is only to bring the children to the outdoor swimming pool area to play in the sand, so I stayed in the shop. After all, our home is only about 6 kilometers away from the intercontinental. When I got to the pool, I was chased by a staff member like a censor to the bar to register the room number and pick up the hand ring. It seemed that we were afraid that we would mix in to eat and drink for nothing. It felt like a five-star or no respect. Since swimming is not open to the public, why do you treat the guests like this? I almost forgot to complain about the turndown service, oh, there is no such thing. According to the manager on duty, this service is only provided to the executive floor or VIP members. I can’t understand it. This is the only one I have stayed in that does not actively provide the turndown service. Where is the industry standard for the five-star hotels. So when the family finished swimming and went back to the room to take a bath and used up all the bath towels and the bathroom was also full of water and sand, they went out after the meal and came back looking forward to the turn-down butler who has cleaned everything, but it didn’t. It was still a mess. Pairs of new slippers were randomly thrown near the entrance, I guess the staff who came in to do the extra bed service let them go. The above opinions have been reported to the duty manager before leaving the store. After apologizing on the phone, he personally came to the door to send a gift. The front desk manager also apologized sincerely when checking out, which shows that the management still attaches great importance to customer satisfaction. . I sincerely hope that the hotel can improve the technical level and professional quality training of the grassroots staff, and don't smash the reputation of the old five-star hotel that has accumulated for many years, and the newly opened luxury hotels in recent years, such as Park Hyatt Andaz Live Isn't the taxi fragrant? If only the garden swimming pool is designed to attract parents and children, if there is no real service improvement, I am afraid that it will not go far in the competition.

msg:I used to live in InterContinental in Dameisha, and I felt ok. This time I went for the brand, and I was a little disappointed. Maybe it was in time for the Mid-Autumn Festival. There were so many people. Room, my friend complained a little, the swimming pool was very crowded, like dumplings, the place where the bath towels were provided next to them even dragged the used bath towels to a bucket and used them directly. My mother saw that, although we didn't use the bath towels they provided , but this can also imagine the health of this hotel. What annoyed me the most was that room 5050 where I lived was completely soundproof. A group of children in the next room kept making trouble until two or three in the middle of the night. Later, I couldn't stand it anymore and called the concierge to complain, and then it stopped. The reason why we say zero sound insulation is because the sound of turning off the light switch next door can be heard really! The only good thing was their account manager Nancy, a pregnant woman who was busy.

The strange thing is that my ipad was originally connected to the Wi-Fi in the room. At 1 o'clock, I found that I couldn't find my iPad with my mobile phone. It is very likely that someone took the ipad out of the room. Then the hotel helped me find the ipad. During this period, I made three or four calls and said that I was still looking for it. After half an hour, I called and said that if you can’t find me, I will call the police. It’s not good to see the police in your lobby by then. Then I found it by asking for help on the phone.

msg:This hotel is completely sorry for the price of fifteen thousand a night. First, there is no parking space, and no one guides the incoming cars. Countless cars drive into the garage without parking spaces, and it is difficult to exit when the cars inside are crowded. Is it difficult to set up a sign indicating no parking space? Second, there is no service at all, I feel that there are few staff and many guests. Third, the facilities in the room are outdated, and the sanitation has not been cleaned. Fourth, there are few entertainment facilities for children, which is not suitable for parent-child travel. The advantage is the pool beach.

I used to live in InterContinental and have a good experience, but the service of InterContinental in this OCT is completely offline, the decoration facilities are outdated, the smell of moldy carpets in the corridor of the guest room, and the balcony doors and windows are broken, these are nothing, the most outrageous is Service, the headset was left on the sofa in the room when I checked out, and I called the front desk and replied that it was not in the room. The second time I called, the reply insisted that the waiter had searched carefully and it was definitely not in the room. The third time we asked for a room The manager's call back was ignored, and he replied that the room supervisor and the waiter had searched the room and couldn't see it. After we positioned the headset, we confirmed that it was in the room, and asked the manager on duty to call back until we made the eighth call. Said to be found. The process was a different operator each time we called, requiring us to repeat the same question each time. If the headset does not have positioning, can you perfunctory guests like this? Really the worst experience ever, and the charger provided in the room is just a decoration, charging 23% in one night.

msg:房間還是不錯的，硬件挺好，買的套餐，送了烏託邦小童樂園和房間電視娛樂，還有户外沙灘游泳和室內泳池，孩子可以完全不用外出。表揚烏託邦小童樂園的工作人員小姐姐們，有耐心很nice，知道小朋友過生日還送了小禮物。
對比來説，酒店前台和熱線的服務就很不到位了。首先辦理入住，沒有排隊的概念，我帶着孩子站半天，不停有人插隊，我實在忍不住問另一個埋頭顯忙的前台（因為他半天沒抬頭看下週未）“我可以辦理入住了嗎”他才抬頭愕然道：“可以啊，我以為你們一起的…… ” 
主動服務意識多差可見一斑。
我們住了三個晚上。第一天送了水果，挺好的。最後一天上午我剛去吃早飯（酒店早餐特別好，點贊，到10點半，種類很豐富），走廊阿姨追着問：你們今天退房嗎？ 我想我還沒要離開酒店呢，這趕人的感覺真不好。
第三天是女兒生日，酒店全程沒有任何錶示，我看其他住客説有房間佈置，我怎麼沒遇到。那天退房我想申請下午稍晚一些，別卡着12點。前台很為難的表示節日人多，最後的確申請了晚退，但過程感覺是我求來的，忍不住告訴了一下前台，今天小朋友生日。前台顯得有點侷促不安，過了會兒追過來送了一個小牛玩偶算是禮物。好吧，也算事一份心意。
整體還是滿意的，沒有硬傷，性價比也不錯，值得推薦。就是細節還有提升空間吧，畢竟是洲際招牌。

可能近期住得比較頻繁，一走進大堂就看到禮賓部的Blake滿臉笑容地前來迎接，主動幫忙拿行李和問候，感覺像見到老朋友一樣。辦理入住時，前台的Alisa和Hina也會根據我的要求安排房間（入住前就已經收到前台電話詢問需求），並且幫忙延遲退房手續的辦理時間，非常符合我這種早上不想動的人。
到達房間後，由於一些原因需要更換房卡，禮賓部的Dennis迴應十分高效迅速，第一時間詢問情況、幫忙跟進，並且每次看到有快遞或者外賣都會親自送上門或者主動安排機器人服務，讓我感到相當親切和熱情。

預訂：多關注點評和**活動，最近的1588的親子房活動就挺划算的，但要問清楚對應入住日期是否加價，加多少

到達：開車導航至洲際大酒店停車場入口即可，很多車位，建議進入後直接停道路邊，不要進地下，地下距離大堂還有點距離

房間：房間較大，浴缸很大很舒適，還標配了浴鹽，小孩的洗漱用品配置齊全

玩樂：室外遊樂場，人工沙灘，室內遊樂場，室內恆温泳池，室外水上樂園，還有各種各樣的活動，就是來遛娃的

飲食：選擇很多，但質量上就乏善可陳了，建議買推薦那個1500的套餐，可以直接抵扣3000的酒店用度

服務：預訂後會有管家加微信，幫忙解決過程的一切問題，酒店禮賓部Ken小吳服務很好，全程跟進，外賣也幫忙取了直接送到房間，點個贊

msg:華僑城洲際是出行深圳的首選！
去年是與愛人入住行政套房，體驗極佳！
這次帶孩子來，住的豪華房間。雖是最基本的客房，但房間空間寬敞，明亮温馨。

在靜謐舒適的環境中美美地入眠，從孩子的視角，全程體驗彷彿一場愉悦的夢境。
早餐，無論是就餐環境還是品種數量，都可圈可點，食物色香味俱佳，品質上乘。
傍晚坐在酒店陽台，葱鬱的花園景觀、鳥鳴、流水聲，賞心悦目，品嚐着酒店精心準備的水果飲品，寧靜而愜意。
這次入住非常感謝賓客部 Pete 陳君的貼心服務，全程得到了高水準超越尋常的待遇，不僅給予了需求上的各種滿足，更在體驗上帶來超值享受，心情格外輕鬆，安逸舒心。
深圳之行，有了華僑城洲際酒店的加持，變的非常完美。希望下次深圳之旅不會隔太久。

msg:過年期間買了套餐，帶孩子來住，華僑城洲際確實是久負盛名，過年期間的深圳也有很多人來住。2點半到店，排隊半小時，免費升了行政套房，但是説要打掃1小時才能進去。
小童樂園很棒，活動也很豐富，工作人員非常熱情友好，有海洋池，户外區，繪本區等。
4點進房間，房間裝修非常豪華，裏面的木質傢俱確實比較舊了，但是整體審美還是不錯的，衞生也不錯。美中不足之處是所有的迷你吧飲料和零食都要收費，如果不是因為套房房型，讓人感覺來到了快捷酒店，之前住的三里屯洲際就都是免費的飲料，體驗感很不一樣。百瑞德的洗漱用品太香了，而且都釘在牆上，更加是快捷酒店即視感。。
早餐讓家人先下來了，家人去了中餐廳，我走錯了到了-1樓，服務員一口咬定早飯衹有這一個地方，結果長者小孩已經在中餐廳吃完了。。
還是值得5分，因為升房了，而且孩子也玩兒的比較開心，比大梅沙洲際適合遛娃。美中不足之處可能來源於期望值過高，整體來説還是比較推薦的。

msg:房間房頂有挑高，感覺很寬敞。房間裝修是歐式偏法式風格，佈局合理，浴室很大，景觀很好，小陽台坐着有度假的休閑感。在華僑城這種寸金寸土的地方，可以有這樣一個酒店讓你享受片刻寧靜舒適的時光實屬難得。酒店園林、泳池等設施是亮點之一，一定要好好轉轉。
有優點也有缺點，因為酒店是以以前的深圳灣酒店主體改造，所以沒有設大型地庫，這樣如果遇上有宴會舉行，停車位就會很不足。
自助餐品質也是時高時低，以前覺得很豐富，來過幾回後發現品質有所下降，因此就沒再去過吃自助餐了。2022年時再去發現品質又回到該有水平，但這次入住時去用餐，又有些失望…哈哈哈哈！
在這裏要讚揚一下洲際的管家服務，管家Sirius的服務非常體貼細心周到，有什麼問題迴應迅速，真的可以做到讓住客賓至如歸，衝著這點，洲際就該得到我的五🌟好評！

1.check in花了30分鐘才辦好，安排了一間故障房（房間電視是壞的，進房間那一刻還有人在修理）
2.下午三點過來辦理入住，居然告知還要再等三個小時才能打掃好房間，如果等不了就衹能安排在遠離電梯口最遠的房間，步行到房間需要五分鐘！關鍵前台接待一副愛咋咋地，愛住不住的表情。 豪華五星級酒店？開什麼玩笑呢？
3.房間設施陳舊，一股異味，洗澡下水道無法正常排水！馬桶恐怕連經濟型酒店都不如，怕不是用了七八年之久吧。
4.最讓人無語的是：房間真的很吵！我入住房間在二樓，平均每隔五分鐘都會有類似地鐵從地下經過帶來的噪音聲！出來旅遊度假居然成了花錢遭罪！
5.1600的房費居然連個早餐都沒有，真是笑不活了，房間緊張隨意漲價，那你們服務能跟上嗎？這個酒店除了佔據優勢地理位置，還有什麼？ 真是白糟蹋了洲際這個品牌。
非常非常糟糕的入住體驗！以後再攜程預訂洲際品牌酒店都要認真看評論，虛假評論非常多！

     酒店的房間乾淨整潔，管家Miki這次給我安排的房間有個特別大的陽台，看出去就是錦綉中華那邊的景觀，非常滿意！還幫忙提前安排了娃的洗漱用品，也有床圍欄提供，而且剛好碰到娃的生日，還給安排了生日佈置和蛋糕🍰🍰真的非常貼心！！
     酒店裡有中餐廳和咖啡廳，然後我們一家子去吃了自助晚餐，餐品挺豐富的，榴蓮泡芙很好吃！總之本次入住非常開心，酒店性價比很高！下次還會再過來玩~

酒店位於深圳華僑城旅遊度假區，地理位置十分優越，周邊交通便利，且臨近眾多旅遊景點和購物中心，為我們的出行和休閑提供了極大的便利。無論是商務出差還是家庭度假，這裏都是一個理想的選擇。
我入住的是雙床房，房間寬敞明亮，設施齊全，床鋪舒適柔軟，讓人一夜好眠。房間內的裝潢考究，每一個細節都透露出酒店的品質與用心。特別是房間內的觀景陽台，讓我可以盡情欣賞到深圳美麗的城市風光。

在餐飲方面，酒店的自助餐廳和中餐廳都給我們留下了深刻的印象。自助餐廳的菜品豐富多樣，新鮮美味，滿足了不同口味的需求。中餐廳則以其精緻的菜品和優質的服務贏得了我們的一致好評。我們一家三口在這裏享受了美食的盛宴，度過了愉快的用餐時光。

除了舒適的客房和美味的餐飲，酒店的娛樂設施也讓我們讚不絕口。游泳池寬敞明亮，水質清澈，是夏天消暑的好去處。此外，酒店還提供了健身房、小童遊樂區等多種娛樂設施，讓我們在忙碌的行程中也能找到放鬆身心的好去處。

在性價比方面，我認為華僑城洲際酒店絕對是物超所值的。優質的服務、舒適的環境以及豐富的設施都讓我對這次入住體驗讚不絕口。

最後，我要特別感謝Sirius在我入住期間提供的貼心服務。他/她的專業素養和熱情周到的服務讓我感受到了家一般的温暖。在這裏，我要對Sirius表示衷心的感謝和讚揚！

總之，深圳華僑城洲際酒店是一家值得推薦的五星級酒店。無論是環境、地理位置、房間設施還是性價比都讓人無可挑剔。

首先考慮親子，衹有親子套房才有免費小童樂園玩，我們定了普通豪華房，孩子除了玩下沙灘什麼都沒有體驗到。這一點建議不要叫親子酒店。

整體體驗非常好

早餐混亂！管理混亂！吃早餐還能順帶看到洲際員工吵架！呵呵🙂，在餐廳裏走路，客人要給服務人員讓路，不然就堵着你！等等吧，不想碼字了……
這是目前我住過的，最差的，沒有之一的洲際！

服務：酒店的服務非常周到，員工態度好、熱情而且專業，耐心的解答我的每一個問題，遞送物品也非常快，還有管家Miki提前聯繫我幫忙安排了我房間喜好，讓我整個入住期間都感到很滿意。
設施設備方面：酒店房間很大，帶陽台，視野也很開闊，我的房間在陽台處還能看到泳池，晚上在陽台吹吹晚風真的非常舒適，性價比真的蠻高的。
總之本次入住達到了甚至超出了我的預期，我過的非常快樂，下一次還會再次選擇

服務也很不錯哦！

Laurie 小姐姐，小孩子們玩的不亦樂乎，還主動幫我延遲了2個小時退房，免費的，給力！

前台小姐姐lily也是很贊，很nice。

遺憾的是因為週末下雨，娃一直心心念唸的水上樂園沒有讓她們去玩，下次再來，總之是一個值得帶娃來放電的好地方。

空間很大，有浸浴浴缸及露台。酒店有室內外游泳池，人工沙灘和小型水上樂園，小朋友玩得非常開心，樂而忘返！

自助早餐，食物應有盡有，最特別是有鮮榨果汁，中途亦有員工同小朋友玩遊戲送禮物。

大廳的員工全部都非常有禮，拎完房卡後，有職員帶領到坐電梯位置，拿取行李後，員工亦幫忙拿行李到我與家人等待的位置，每位員工的小舉動都好窩心，讓人留下深刻印象。期待下次洲際再見！

節假日高峯期，兩點辦理入住，前台告知沒有乾淨房間，我們寶寶還小急着睡午覺，於是協調後入住。
酒店的親子設施很多，如果跟我一樣停留不久的家庭可以不用選擇烏託邦，免費的都玩不過來了。室外泳池、水上樂園都很贊，還有室外小童樂園我們都沒時間去，小孩被挖沙子和游泳牢牢抓住了心。
服務：管家服務很不錯，叫初銘。停車問題都是請她安排的，另外在節假日高峯也爭取申請了延退，給寶寶睡個午覺的時間，很棒。
房間服務員也很貼心，給小盆友送來了很多小童用具。寶寶不小心打翻了甜品，服務員立刻來清理。沒有額外收費。
還會再來，這個酒店值得stay更久一些。

msg:跟小朋友原本開開心心訂了這家酒店,誰想到會發生小朋友無故被酒店的按摩池划傷的悲劇。
酒店的所謂「水上樂園」是幾個兒童水上滑梯加幾根小水槍柱,比較小,跟香港的公共游泳池戲水池相約。人造沙灘倒是比較有創意,水質甚麼的都比較乾淨清澈。
玩完室外,跟小朋友去室內洗梳期間,小朋友在一個按摩池不知道被甚麼划了一下小腿,鮮血頓時流出.....最後酒店估摸是水池的小磁磚划的,這是後話了。都不用大動靜,小朋友光在水池中走一圈就可以划傷,我對於酒店的設備有無恆常保養檢查,以及安全設計是否達標都存在深深的疑問......
我在對出的服務台找來一個酒店職員(估計是清潔阿姨?)問她要急救藥品止血,她過了好一陣子不知道在哪找來了創可貼,還有一瓶外表髒舊快要乾掉的碘酒,因為也沒有其他選擇了,最後硬著頭皮用了。給小朋友清潔貼上創可貼後她就走開.了,期間也沒酒店其他人員過來詢問關心,我們還穿著泳衣,如果血還是不停流,那該如何好呢?此刻的我感到非常無助,孩子也是害怕極了,問我如何是好!我能夠做的只能是強作鎮定。諾大的五星級酒店竟然提供這樣的急救設備以及如此缺乏培訓的工作人員!到底是為甚麼?!!!等了一會兒,創可貼又浸滿了血,貌似血止不住,我又跑外面去找那個阿姨,又問她拿來了創可貼,後來血還是止不住,她又在不知道哪裡拿個雲南白藥藥粉過來,撒在傷口上,又貼上創可貼,那個創可貼其實還不能完全蓋住傷口。
小朋友跟我的身體還是濕的,還沒換乾淨的衣服,後來我們跑上了房間,換了身乾的衣服...事情過了將近一小時,安頓好孩子,最後我打了個電話去告訴酒店我的小朋友在酒店受傷了。此時才有個自稱經理的工作人員帶同創可貼上來慰問,至於酒店有多少歉意,很遺憾我也沒感受到。
伴隨著之後我繼續用電郵投訴跟進,酒店才跟我商討說免費讓我去吃個下午茶,去玩個酒店兒童樂園甚麼的,我們一樣都沒接受,已經對酒店失去信心了。
住了這麼久酒店,竟然給一家國際連鎖五星級酒店差評,這也是我萬萬沒想到的。發生意外無人能料,正是這樣的小意外已經足以凸顯酒店的不足,如果發生更大的意外呢?是否會有更不堪的後果以及處理手法呢? 不得而知。

一樓大堂迎賓、前台和前廳經理服務專業、熱情。
價格在親子度假酒店不算貴，本週末也就1300左右，住宿的環境、衞生等比同星級的酒店好多了，5000平的室內外遊樂場帶有親子餐廳，餐廳的咖喱雞和鮮榨果汁小朋友很喜歡。親子餐廳還有每日手工課程小孩子可以在裏面待上一整天啊，大堂和餐廳服務態度熱情，對小朋友也很友好值得推薦，5顆星。

msg:非常值得入住的親子酒店，很有度假感也很放鬆。沙灘和泳池很推薦。烏託邦也推薦，另外付費。
服務人員因人而異，有的很不錯，有的沒精神。因為酒店的定位和價格，我期待可以讓客人的度假感體驗提升，更多微笑，更會‘’來事兒‘’的服務可以吸引更多本地人週末來渡個假。

服務也很好，特別鳴謝賓客關係部的小陳及礼宾部的Gavin黄万斌。
關係部的小陳在我排隊入住時，主動幫我辦理手續，解答所有問題，亦主動介紹附近的景點！
礼宾部的Gavin在深夜時分幫我解決外賣問題！
兩位職員都很主動有禮，酒店也很好！令我一家有一個愉快的旅程。

▪️可能我們入住接近18點了吧，房間比較深邃，過道走了很久，如果帶箱子的可以讓前台幫忙，不然輪子劃不動。
▪️最最最最最值得誇讚的是酒店內的人造沙灘和小童樂園！因為這個我選擇的這家酒店，真的很不錯。小朋友7點多醒來，8點就去沙灘了🏖️，沒人哈哈哈哈。這個時候太陽還沒不熱，差不多9點多沙灘區域陽光就比較曬了。選擇留在沙灘玩的，可以帶水槍、穿好泳衣、趕海水桶挖具、防曬準備、還有速幹毛巾。
▪️9點左右我們轉戰小童樂園，也是室外，就在人造沙灘旁邊，水比想象的乾淨很清澈，小朋友開心得要命。有好幾個滑梯，不刺激，相對比較安全。最讚的是大水桶，哇塞，好爽好嗨！10點30左右沙灘區域的小童就陸續多了，但真的很曬。
最後，這家是我會推薦給朋友，下次來還會考慮優選的酒店✌️

msg:過年期間第一次帶着兩個孩子出遊，一個9歲，一個不到1歲。事實證明選擇華僑城洲際是非常明智的選擇。長者、爸爸可以帶着大寶出去轉轉，酒店離世界之窗、民俗園都很近，也可以在酒店內活動，有烏託邦、人工沙灘、游泳池等等；帶小寶，酒店內的設施也夠玩啦，看看沙灘、海盜船、坐個小火車、旋轉木馬（烏託邦的室外部門過年期間是免費的）、還有給小寶寶用的加温的泳池，剩下時間還是都在房間小睡休息。房間內還給小寶配備了床圍和單獨的嬰兒床，嬰兒床我覺得非常好用，小寶在嬰兒床裏面玩耍完全可以解放雙手。當然，酒店也存在一些問題，比如嬰兒床圍不太結實，第一晚孩子就出現了掉床的情況，後來人工加固，拿座椅擋住才算安全。而且酒店的床實在有點高，一般成人都要跳一下才能坐上去，而且有點太軟，不習慣睡軟床的人確實覺得不太舒服。衞生間洗手盆的設計感覺很容易藏污納垢，清潔度不是很夠，洗浴用品確實看起來比較低廉，並且沒有及時補充。但是總的來説，瑕不掩瑜吧。總之還是一次不錯的假期，正好趕上過春節，酒店也是年味十足，和一家人在這裏度假心情還是不錯的。

環境：像是住在熱帶雨林， 整體設計理念和設施很像我們在歐洲住的一價全包的度假酒店。 大泳池，人造沙灘， 椰子樹 躺椅，水滑梯，小童嬉水池， 池畔bar， 繞園區小火車， 池塘大錦鯉，簡直應有盡有。 孩子在泳池玩兒的特別high，完全不出來🤣，沙灘比較淺，家長直接躺在躺椅上看着就行 非常省心～～～但小齡寶寶家長還是多注意盯着孩子別吃沙子或沙進入眼睛耳朵等。 泳池邊提供乾淨毛巾可以隨時領取， 周圍還有各式各樣的休息床榻， 涼亭，樹蔭下躺着休息一下太愜意了～

地理位置：出門就是地鐵，近到都不用走。穿過地鐵過馬路就有一個圍繞着沃爾瑪的商圈，有不少好吃的餐館（推薦金光鴿王），酒店就挨着民俗風情園（完全沒顧上逛一下），再往南邊就是歡樂海岸購物中心吃飯逛街看夜景yyds～ 因為這次主要陪老公商務出差， 獨自帶娃懶在酒店😂哪兒也沒逛， 感覺周圍還有好些有意思的地方待開發。 訂外賣也超快速就送到。 

服務：酒店服務很好～ 員工都很nice，隨時都看到有員工在打掃園區。特別感謝賓客關係部 王朝的熱情服務～ 下次一定還來～

位置：華僑城商圈，毗鄰民俗村、離世界之窗步行10分鐘。
房間：本次豪華大床+豪華雙床，內聯通特別適合大孩子的家庭，各自相對有獨立空間。
酒店設施：室內室外游泳池、烏託邦親子樂園，親子家庭友好。
衞生：不錯，入住率很高的前提下，很乾凈。
服務：響應很快，從門僮主動拿行李、到前台Alicia温暖的笑容、再到入住期間Chole微信問候，熱情服務讓人賓至如歸。￼
另外中餐廳菜品味道很好，值得一試。

在check in時，人很多排隊用了很多時間，櫃檯職員略嫌欠缺效率。。。

酒店內形形色色的客人也有，有些比較沒禮貌的暴發戶打尖，酒店職員也沒岀聲，基於自身修養及不想影響放假心情，也沒和他們計較。

泳池很大，兒童水上樂園很小，人造沙灘的沙比較粗，沙灘旁沒有儲物櫃，如想存放手提電話，房卡等，要進入更衣室內的存物櫃，比較不方便，而進入更衣室的冷氣非常大，如已游水身已濕，再進入裡面有機會冷親。

被安排到3140房，房間在最盡頭，比較遠，沒有露台，近錦繡中華，聲浪較大。

其他都還好，房間很大，有衣帽間，床也大，枕頭太軟，睡醒膊頭痛，地毯上有明顯污漬，似是上一手住客留下，毛巾沒味道，浴室尚算乾淨，但廁紙架上有灰塵。

酒店職員尚算有禮，有笑容，更衣室嬸嬸親切。

泳池附近每一個小時都會有活動比小朋友玩，但沒有清晰告示，可作改善。

總結，因是星期日入住，房價比較平，覺得還好，星期五六房價要2000，我就覺得不值。

msg:小兒子出生那年來住過這家洲際，元旦出行想着再來體驗一下。雖然酒店裝修有些年頭了，但是維護得還不錯。入住期間確實發生了點小問題，但是樓層經理，突然記不住名字了，但是及時出面給與解決。
賓客專員Jaen也跟蹤住宿情況。
總之，入住感受，服務還是到位得。

msg:整體體驗不錯，房間寬敞乾淨，check in人手充足，等候時間合理。唯仍有改善空間：

入住前2至3天很貼心收到電郵及短訊提示及核對資料跟進，唯發現資料有出入，即時經電郵及短訊提出，到退房後仍未收到過回覆（短訊有回，但跟第一個提示短訊一樣，疑似系統回覆），感覺浪費了回覆的時間及跨境短訊收費。

房間的mini bar及電冰箱不知何故是鎖著的。

房間景觀比較一般，對著入口的一道牆。

Rain shower 水壓夠及非常舒服，但正常花灑水壓偏低及水溫不穩定，時冷時熱很不順心。

前台提示酒店內兒童樂園Kids Utopia 要另外收費，398元一大一小，住客並沒有優惠。網站或其他渠道都找不到有關樂園資料，客戶難以比較安排。

游泳池很大，也有滑梯等好玩設施。但管理上可以嚴謹一點，例如我們被要求到服務台登記及戴上手帶，但發現有約1／3使用者並沒有手帶；目睹多次有人穿上拖鞋踏入游泳池或者用池水洗拖鞋，而工作人員就在旁邊；小朋友在滑梯插隊情況非常普遍，既然工作人員閒著在旁，倒不如勸告及維持一下秩序。

星期天餐廳位置明顯不足，高峰時超過60人排隊，食物供應也跟不上，熱門食物如培根經常空盤，目睹有客人連墊在培根底的面包也不放過！自選果汁吧更是混亂。很多客人帶走一盒盒食物水果離開，竟然有些還自備餐盒，不知道這是否國內標準，因為有員工在旁而似乎是默許的。

不知怎的，大部分員工好像工作得很鬱結，基本上都有禮，但很機械式，下一秒已愁著臉。感覺上國內集團經營的酒店還要熱情親切自然點。

不太感受得到此國際大品牌如其他地方的質素，按同樣價位，下次可能會選另一間。

msg:各樣很好
就是刚开始时各樣服务的使用方法有点不清晰
自助晚歺性價比有点低
而且收费因為用了餐飲額也是收正價贵了差不多500，
有一点点取巧
幸好有Angelia的協助，最后小朋友能參加最後一天的烘焙班。给她10分。
