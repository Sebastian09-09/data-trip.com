msg:The Hilton Garden, which just opened in May, has good hardware and great service attitude! Especially Hebe deng, the front desk who helped check in, has a friendly smile! That kind of enthusiasm really makes people feel comfortable! During the stay, every staff member you meet will greet you with a smile when you go in and out of the hotel, and the efficiency of water replenishment is very high, love it! The view of the restaurant is particularly great! The gym and laundry room are together, which is very convenient. I like the swimming pool very much and went there twice. The only drawback is that because it has just opened, the restaurant only has two set menus to choose from in the evening, and there are not many dishes a la carte. The breakfast variety is not enough, even worse than some Huanpeng, but fortunately the bowl of rice noodles is delicious! The afternoon tea is standard and drinkable. As a garden-style hotel, the hardware in all aspects is really good, and the bathroom is Roca. I will go to experience it again in a while. Overall satisfied, if it weren't for Xingping opening this hotel, I don't think I could stay for 3 days~

msg:*This is the only garden-level five-star hotel in Xingping Ancient Town. It is surrounded by mountains, a large grassland, a horse farm on the grassland, and a small river flowing in front of the door. I stayed in a garden view room on the first floor. The balcony is a garden with direct access to the swimming pool. The room is also equipped with outdoor barbecue lamps and ovens, which is very suitable for family trips, parties, and dinner parties. You can’t miss taking photos and checking in with internet celebrities.
*Hilton's bedding is as good as ever, and the mattresses and pillows are soft enough; as well as their camping equipment, the swings are my children's favorites. I also like their washing machines and dryers, which are equipped with Bama pure water. Xu Hilton's humanized management is reflected everywhere.
The hotel restaurant is divided into indoor and outdoor areas, with beautiful scenery inside and outside. The Garden Hotel deserves its reputation. The ingredients for the buffet breakfast are very fresh. I will never forget their cakes.
*Hilton's service is also first-class. The staff will take the initiative to say hello when we meet after check-in. I would like to express my special thanks to Manager Lu for his considerate housekeeping service after I checked in, as well as Miss He at the front desk and Manager Gan at the front desk for their welcoming hospitality.
*The hotel has an excellent location and convenient transportation. You can walk to Xingping Ancient Town. There is also an electric car rental service at the door for 20 yuan a day. It is very convenient to go to Jiu Ma Wall Painting and check in for 20 yuan.
I was very lucky to encounter a rain. After the rain, the mist and rain locked in the south of the Yangtze River, which was another scene.

msg:The newly opened hotel is built near mountains and rivers. The decoration is low-key, practical and warm. It occupies a small area but has many facilities, including a gym and laundry room. The breakfast is rich, especially the rice noodles are very delicious. The only drawback is that there are only two set meals and several dishes to choose from. I don't like it even after eating a few meals. I hope to add more dishes. There is a large supermarket diagonally across from the hotel alley, which is convenient for buying fruits. A few minutes walk to Xingping Ancient Town. It costs 20 yuan to take pictures at the background, ride on an electric bamboo raft, and take a taxi for only 8 yuan. The hotel's infinity swimming pool is built between mountains and rivers, and people are really "swimming" in the painting! After the rain, the clouds and mountains are shrouded in mist, just like a fairyland. I have stayed in many hotels owned by Hilton. This one is very unique. Every room has a courtyard or terrace, so you can move and get close to nature at any time. Equipped with camping tables, chairs, and outdoor coffee making equipment, you can see that the small details are very attentive. The hotel staff are warm and thoughtful, especially the handsome man with big eyes at the front desk, who helped us upgrade our room for free, and gave us reminders and reminders in advance during lunch and afternoon tea time. Arrangement, every staff member took the initiative to say hello. There is still a bit of decoration in the room. Holidays are limited, hope to stay again!

msg:The scenery of the hotel is beautiful, and the overall style is camping and holiday, which makes people relax physically and mentally

The front desk attitude is very good, and the staff training is also good. The new hotel has more or less some problems, which are all well solved

The breakfast really drags down the overall quality. Except for the delicious Guilin rice noodles, the others are unpalatable, and there are very few varieties. They have not been replaced for two days, and I don’t know if it is left over from the previous day

The afternoon tea is the snacks left over from breakfast, which can be regarded as saving food

The overall experience is good, and it is still recommended for holiday stays

The buffet breakfast is not very varied, but the quality is very good, especially the Western-style pastries and breads are delicious. The hotel staff are very warm and polite, especially the Orange sister at the front desk. She is beautiful and sweet. Knowing that our high-speed train will not depart until 3 o'clock, she specially applied for a late check-out for us. Thank you very much! I will come again if I have the chance.

msg:The hotel is very new. There is still a bit of smell when you check in. You need to open the balcony door to get some air. The whole hotel seems to be camping-themed. There are camping chairs and camping equipment in the room. If you choose the right room, it is still very comfortable to sit on the balcony.
It is recommended to choose a room with a swimming pool. You can see the mountain view on the balcony. Opposite is the farm with its own lawn and horses. The scenery is very good. The breakfast is quite satisfactory, with special oil tea and Guilin rice noodles.
The service is also good. All the staff will greet you and respond quickly if you need anything. I stayed for three days and two nights. The only complaint is that the room's point occasionally breaks down and recovers quickly. I don't know what happened. Overall, I am very satisfied.

msg:This time I decided to travel to Guilin and Yangshuo temporarily because I saw this recommended hotel. Thinking about the newness and the Hilton brand, it was dramatic that this hotel was the most infuriating experience during this trip.
    First look at the front desk reception. It was after 10 o'clock when we arrived, and the front desk said that the room had not been cleaned up yet. This is normal and understandable. Because my best friend bought a train ticket for after 3 pm the next day, when I checked in, I casually asked if I could check out later. The person at the front desk said no, because there was a tour group checking in the next day. I said We are members and several of our friends are Hilton members. Can't we delay it for a while? The receptionist still said no, with a curt attitude. After I finished, I took the kids around the hotel for a while and said that the room would not be available for another 20 minutes. We had to take the kids for a walk around the ancient town. It was past 12 o'clock when we got back. It was very hot and the kids were sleeping on the stroller. On fire. The front desk gave me the room card. I asked which floor it was on because the hotel has three floors. She said the first floor. I asked if there were more mosquitoes on the first floor. Could you move me to the second floor? Children are indeed more afraid of mosquito bites. People say they are not, so I don’t care. I just want to go to the room quickly. Our luggage was stored at the front desk at first. I couldn't carry too much luggage while pushing my child, and my best friend couldn't carry it all at once. I asked the front desk if they could use a luggage cart or someone to help deliver it, but the front desk said They didn’t have this service, and I was shocked at the time. This is so awesome. There was no service at all. Not to mention that you were using the banner of Hilton. An ordinary small hotel could easily do something like this if it saw this situation. I It took my best friend two trips to get my luggage back. When the waiter gave us the room card, he didn't give us any hints about how to get to the room. We didn't see any signs nearby, so we just looked for it like headless flies. I was so angry at that time. This is why I came here because of it. hotel!!! In fact, I have already visited Guilin and Yangshuo. I can take the high-speed train back directly from Xingping, just to experience this hotel, so I stayed for one day. This experience is really the best! I don’t know if they think they are the owners of the hotel or if they don’t care about individual guests like us checking in. It really damages the hotel’s image.
    Let’s talk about the situation in the room. Although the hotel is newly opened, many details of the decoration are rough at first glance. Slippers and toothbrushes are similar to those used in hotels that cost one or two hundred yuan. The room does have a large balcony, but there are so many bugs on the balcony floor that they are so densely packed that they give goosebumps all over the body. The children dare not go to the balcony at all. How could there be so many bugs in a freshly cleaned house? ￼I didn’t clean the balcony at all. My best friend and I called each other, and the waiter came to sweep away the bugs. This experience was truly unlucky. 
    This time I stayed in B&Bs in both Guilin and Yangshuo, but their facilities and services were far superior to this hotel. There is really no harm in comparison. One is in the sky and the other is on the ground. This is the worst experience I have ever had in a hotel. .

msg:A newly opened hotel in Yangshuo, located in Xingping Ancient Town. The environment is impeccable and very beautiful. I don't know if it was because of insufficient staff or something, but the hotel was a bit messy. The room still had a bit of a decoration smell. Fortunately, after telling the front desk, we were provided with an air purifier and floral water in the room. There were indeed a lot of mosquitoes. There were also a lot of camping equipment in the room, which you can try. The main complaint is their dining. There are too few varieties in the morning buffet. The dinner level in the evening does not match the hotel's Xingji at all. I hope there will be improvements in the future.

msg:Personally, I feel that the hotel cannot meet basic operating standards at all.
1. All services are basically self-service. There was no concierge, and the luggage cart was available for self-service. There was only a lady who claimed to have a herniated disc, and we didn’t dare to bother her. When I checked out, I brought the luggage trolley and asked my father with his eyes open if he could help me? When my husband asked for help, she complained of back pain. This eldest sister holds multiple positions such as concierge, front desk, and room service. Many house cleaning ladies only arrived at the store one day earlier than me. Apart from having a really good attitude, they couldn't solve any real problems.
2. Eat a full breakfast and clear away the previous guest's plate when you see an empty table before you can get a seat. In addition to the pre-made set menu, the restaurant can only order two dishes (tomato eggs and radish beef). There is a young man in the restaurant who has a very good attitude and wears many hats: waiter, room server, restaurant cleaner... It feels like the restaurant would collapse without him...
3. Too many spare parts! The slippers have a chemical smell and are made of chemical fiber. They will burn your feet when worn. It is recommended to bring your own or bring them from the previous hotel. Bath towels don't absorb much water. You can look at the material. It's particularly uncomfortable to wipe on your body! Basically, you need to change your toothbrush every day. Rinse your mouth frequently after brushing your teeth. Don't talk. A hair falling out of your mouth can easily get stuck in your throat.
4. It is difficult to get through to the front desk phone, either the line is busy or no one answers. Contacting Ctrip customer service is easier than calling the front desk. I asked for a bucket of ice and waited for fifty minutes. Don't expect the front desk to provide prompt service. When I asked him, "I am the only one and I can't leave. You can solve it yourself."
5. One day in advance, I called specifically to inform me of my arrival time and ordering requirements. The front desk also asked me to confirm the restaurant myself. Under my patient guidance, I told him: You can record my message for verification first and then go to the restaurant to make arrangements. If you have any questions, you can call me again. As a result, there were three rooms for seven of us. We arrived at the hotel around 1:30, and only one room was available. The other rooms could not be cleaned in time, so we could not guarantee that the room would be handed over at 3 o'clock. In the end, Ctrip helped solve the problem. What I don’t quite understand is that when the guest asked for a room to be delivered on time, and if it could not be met, Ctrip would be informed that the hotel would handle it as if there was no room available, but the lady with a protruding disc in her waist emphasized that she had monitoring at the front desk... Could it be that in her understanding, no matter what How many rooms have been booked? As long as one room is given before three o'clock, does it count as handing over the room on time?
6. Later, a particularly magical scene occurred. The manager made a difficult decision and "upgraded" a room to me. Same room type, same sofa, the upgraded sofa has the function of changing into a bed, which is really amazing!
7. The hotel charges a deposit of RMB 1,000 for a room, but there are no consumption items. Later, I was as smart as I was. I found out that there was a list of camping equipment in the room and checked it in time. Each room was missing two stainless steel thermos cups. I quickly informed the hotel to verify, avoiding a "misunderstanding". Everyone must check these items when checking in!
The new hotel bedding and towel stains should not have the same wear and tear as the old supplies. Therefore, coupled with the lack of manpower and the tightness of room cleaning, guests will inevitably have some daydreams.
If you consider the hotel's cost-effectiveness and price, I really recommend spending a few hundred more to choose Banyan Tree. There will definitely be minor problems, but it won't be a surprise.
It is recommended that owners and brands choose a more reliable management team. Good products are not cheap, and good products are not cheap. The service industry is not afraid of being stupid or not understanding, but it is afraid of talking more than doing. Ten words to prevaricate the guest are not as direct as one sincere action. As for the front office manager who has a bad waist, let her take care of herself first before coming to work, in line with the hotel's principle of humanistic care. Today's consumers are not stupid. It is understandable that they are anxious to recoup costs, but please don't make it look too ugly.
Ps: There are some comments at the beginning, the pictures are all the same, the publishing locations are all in Guangxi, most of them are platinum level, you can figure it out for yourself.

The hotel is located in the scenic area of ​​Xingping Ancient Town in Yangshuo, close to Xingping Ancient Street and within walking distance. With the background of 20 yuan and the blessing of Yangshuo's landscape, the hotel has won the first place before it opened; from site selection, construction to decoration, it shows its extraordinary and unique vision. The courtyard-style building with strong local characteristics is integrated with nature. Living in the hotel is like living in the scenic area. Every staff member greets and greets politely. The Guilin rice noodles for breakfast are authentic and memorable. The front desk attendants "Little Apple" and "Little Orange" are warm and professional in hospitality, which deserves praise. What I remember most is that on the first night of my stay, I accidentally broke the glass jar of fruit in the hotel. A female manager (supervisor) at the front desk first asked me, "Are you okay?" Then she immediately arranged for the waiter to clean up, which touched me and I would like to express my sincere thanks! I stayed for four consecutive days. On May 9th, it happened to be the hotel's opening ceremony. I was fortunate to enjoy the cultural performances, light shows and fireworks shows. I wish the hotel will do better and better!

At the same time, because it is open, there are many small flying insects, which also shows that the ecology is good from one perspective.
The location is in Xingping Ancient Town, close to the entrance of the ancient town. It is 40 minutes (low season) to 1 hour (longer in peak season, if there is a traffic jam) from Yangshuo by car, so Baozi who lives here should pay attention to planning his itinerary.
The service staff are very good, the breakfast is in line with Hilton standards, and the gym, self-service laundry room, etc. are all complete.
Thank you to Little Apple who helped me check in and also gave me the card holder as a small gift.

msg:The environment and sanitation are very good. Each room has at least a large independent balcony, and the scenery is also good. The room facilities are complete, and the details are still in place! But probably because the hotel has just opened, the early training of the front desk is not enough, the business is not proficient, and mistakes are made in a hurry. If there are not many people, it will still take a long time to handle it. At the same time, the details of the guests are not carefully recorded. For example, when renewing the room, I specifically asked the front desk not to move the tea cups and bed sheets, just replace the garbage and replenish the items. However, when I returned to the room, I found that the two cups that had been washed and soaked in tea were originally cold and ready to drink when I returned to the room. As a result, they were all poured out, everything was moved, and the pajamas on the bed were also placed on the sofa. I understand but still hope to bring it up so that the hotel can do better! We have basically never been disappointed when staying at Hilton Hotels. Of course, these details cannot be defined as bad. After all, we can feel that most employees are taking service seriously! Thank you

msg:This hotel has nothing to say. It is of high quality and professional service. It is more fun to bring children here in summer. It should be the most pleasant place in the ancient town. Give a thumbs up to Sister Orange at the front desk, who temporarily arranged a room for me.

msg:希爾頓品牌保證，很棒很精緻的酒店，坐落在古鎮的一角，緊靠一條小河。

歡迎禮品:比較敷衍。
歡迎飲品:就門口的自助茶飲，沒有杯子，等杯子等了好一會兒。
店內旅拍:沒有時間體驗。
酒店最棒的就是花園和泳池了，從無邊泳池看過去，遠處的山，近處的草地和吃草的馬兒，好一副美麗動人的田園風光，真的很棒！

msg:酒店位置很好，出門右轉不到200米就到興坪古街，酒店很大在小河旁邊，非常幽靜。門口租個小電驢，到20元打卡點，九馬畫山，灕江碼頭都不遠，步行可到老寨山看日落，非常方便。缺點是酒店太新，還有裝修味道，開門通風后就好很多

所以希望下次去的時候，前台的服務態度會變得更加熱情和真誠。

沒有禮賓，沒有服務，這些都沒事……
若有緣看到這些字，建議為了健康，慎重考慮。
