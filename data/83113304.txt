msg:A very satisfying resort hotel! We arrived on the fifth day of the Chinese New Year, and it was already the peak of the return trip, so there was no one in the hotel. We rented the place for ourselves, haha~ It was very quiet and comfortable~ There was a parent-child playground in the swimming pool. It was a hotel built in a flower base. It was very large, and the air around was very good. There were many welcoming pines planted~ However, Guilin was rainy and foggy those days~ I highly recommend this hotel, the room is very large with a terrace, and I didn't want to go out to play when I stayed in the hotel~ The waiters were very polite! 1k+ a night is worth it~

msg:I want to blow this hotel up! Jimeis, go!
This hotel is the most satisfying for family travel in Guilin! The hotel is located in the flower base and is a tribal concept resort hotel. The park is very large, the greening and design are particularly beautiful, and it is very quiet. There are complete recreational facilities, including a private cinema, a small zoo, a basketball court, etc. You can also ride in the park.

It was so cool to drink tea and relax on the porch in the waterfront room. The hotel service was also very good. From the front desk receptionist to the cleaning aunt, from the restaurant service staff to the little brother who drove us around the park by electric car, they were all very enthusiastic. I want to give it ten stars!

The hotel is also very good in terms of details, such as disposable bath bags, bath balls, loofah irons, and massage oil. See the pictures for details.

There are views everywhere in the hotel, and the photos are very impressive. The natural landscape and design are very good.

By the way, breakfast is divided into Chinese and Western set meals, which are very rich, and the mixed rice noodles are especially delicious. You can also order lunch and dinner at reasonable prices. There are also some farmhouses in the flower base outside the hotel, which are quite unique. If you take a taxi to the city, it takes about ten minutes and the fare is only about ten yuan.

In short, I didn‚Äôt live enough. I will stay in this hotel next time!

At night, lying on the balcony, we can see the starry sky, with our loved ones around us, and we feel extremely happy.

msg:On the edge of Guilin city, it is an independent leisure resort. It is our stopover on the way to Guizhou. The entire hardware facilities are actually very good, but the location is relatively remote and suitable for self-driving.
The room was upgraded for free, and the double swimming pool is good;
The hotel zoo is my plus point, especially Master Zhang who raises animals must be highly praised and very patient. He released large and small sika deer for children to experience feeding together, unlimited times, and also released donkeys and ponies. He enthusiastically asked the children if they wanted to ride on them to experience it. He also had a professional understanding of animals;
There are fewer front desk staff, but fortunately their attitude is relatively enthusiastic, and the master who drives the battery car is basically on call. The children's development base is relatively small, and the children can barely play; fortunately, the hotel bicycles can be ridden freely and can be played in the park.
But the restaurant's off-duty time is too early. The first time I went there at almost nine o'clock in the evening, the staff said they would get off work at 8 o'clock; the next day at 7 o'clock in the evening, they told us that they were off work too. Although the restaurant chef enthusiastically asked if we wanted to take his car to the city to eat, it was indeed too early to get off work and there were no restaurants around. Later, I had a 388 set meal in the restaurant at noon, which was very good value and delicious

They can only provide one bottle of body lotion. Duoyao will tell you that it is enough. Well, we have rules. Which 5-star hotel is like this? How to use it for a family of three? There were yellow stains on the towels in the room. I don't know if the previous one didn't change them after using them, so I didn't dare to use them. The phone in the room didn't work. I called maintenance and they said there was a problem with the wiring and they couldn't fix it. The open-air swimming pool was full of bugs that had fallen from the trees. There was disinfectant or something next to the swimming pool. It was definitely impossible to change the water. I was afraid of allergies, so I didn't let my children go in the water. The curtains are leaking and light is leaking. I don't know what the significance of this curtain is. Children cannot wash alone in the bath, and children cannot squeeze into the squeeze shower gel, so they can only wash it with adults. It's good to cultivate independence. There are no anti-slip mats or hand towels. There is only one front desk for check-in and they are still on the phone. We, the elderly and our children, waited for a few minutes for us to check in. We have to walk a long way with our luggage. It takes about 10 minutes to get from the front desk to the room. We booked a total of 3 rooms for two. Late at night, I asked if I could upgrade the room for children and senior citizens for free. I said it was not allowed if the room was full. I saw that he was not willing, so I said that it would be fine if I added money. Then after hesitating for a while, I said no. I thought it was really full so I didn't say anything. When I came back at 11pm, there was no one at all. I asked him at that time that he didn't even have an electricity card and the doorbell light didn't turn on. He was still quibbling because it was full of people. I knocked on the door and he He also said that someone went out, and at 11 o'clock in the evening, everyone in the whole building went out and refused to come back? The location is not good either. It's far away from the city. Fortunately, we are traveling by car. It takes 30 minutes to drive to the city to eat. The price is the same as the Sheraton. The service is better than this one. It's also next to the urban scenic spot. It's really not good. , the good thing is that the room is big, and there are not many people staying in the hotel during the summer vacation. It is very clean (they themselves said that the full room may be occupied by ghosts). I wonder if his good reviews are fake.

When I checked in, I was given a small warm bouquet and upgraded to a water view room. The swimming pool has a suitable temperature and is equipped with many floating swimming rings, transparent boats and other facilities, which is very popular among children. You can watch a movie in a private theater at night, and the outdoor playground also has lighting, which can release your baby's energy. The part of feeding the small animals shouldn‚Äôt be too interesting. I feel like I could feed the baby for three days without getting tired of it. The clingy sika deer and donkey, the shy alpaca and pony, and the ostrich that dare not approach, all interact closely under the shade of the trees. They are very friendly to small animals and children. I highly recommend it to my friends and would like to spend another weekend just for this hotel. Suggestions for small improvements are given to the catering depar**ent. The level of Chinese food needs to be improved, haha.

msg:The hotel's front desk service is very good, but the hardware and software need to be improved.
1. It is inconvenient to travel. You need to reserve a vehicle in advance. The location of the hotel's taxi is not accurate and the signs are unclear.
2. The hot water is not stable and will heat up suddenly. The room attendant is not very clean and there will be hair.
3. When the swimming pool is open, it is expected to be equipped with lifeguards, and safety awareness is not strong.
Hope the hotel does better.

msg:The whole hotel is very outrageous. In a large newly opened resort, there may be at most five employees in it, and they are all very unprofessional employees. The room was not cleaned, and the paper towels on the bathroom table were not thrown away. The explanation given was that there were too many things on the table and I didn't know what to throw. Why other hotel cleaning aunts of the same level knew it. The breakfast watermelon was also spoiled. You still have to carry your own luggage on the night of your stay. A hotel with a very good environment and very poor service.

msg:I was very lucky. It happened to be a sunny day with blue sky and white clouds. It was very comfortable to sit by the swimming pool. It was quite a photo. I was pleasantly surprised by two things: the rooms are super soundproofed and hot water comes out instantly. If you want to see a different Guilin, the hotel staff recommended the nearby Daxu Ancient Town and Xiong Village, which are very quaint. The location is a little far away, about 45 minutes from the airport. It is recommended that you take a taxi directly or arrange a pick-up, which saves a lot of worry.

msg:I stayed at KuKe with my friends during the Chinese New Year. The whole family had a lot of fun. The children especially loved the fireworks. Although the weather was a bit cold, the service was very warm. The restaurant has good food and the hotel environment is beautiful and comfortable. It would be even better if the swimming pool is open. Looking forward to the summer pool partyüéâ

msg:The hotel occupies a large area, the ecology is very good, and the lake area is like a big park. It is very pleasant to jog and ride in the morning. I booked the surrounding exploration activities with the front desk, and let the local "trend players" take them to camp by the Yulong River. There are no other tourists, and I feel that the whole scenery is monopolized. Passing by, it is very special, very wild and luxurious!

msg:At the end of the year, I experienced the newly opened trendy hotel in Guilin - Guilin Kuke Tribe. The overall feeling was very good! The cool design style, cozy environment, and enthusiastic staff are the highlights. Barista's sweet-scented osmanthus latte is the "must-have medicine" to wake me up every day. Although the hotel's catering needs to be improved, the chef's attitude of seriously asking each table of guests about their dining experience is very worthy of recognitionüëçSince I was lucky enough to experience the afternoon tea set that the hotel was about to launch the next day, I dare say it is the best in Guilin , and the film results are excellent! Looking forward to experiencing the new menu during my next stayüòã
