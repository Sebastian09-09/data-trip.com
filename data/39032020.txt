The service was great, and the room was spacious and very clean. 
We were looking forward to using the swimming pools, unfortunately they were both under maintenance work. 
The breakfast and buffet dinners were pretty good. 
The hotel's location suited our needs, it is not close to the city centre, but is is not too far from Hong Qiao Airport and railway station. 
There is free parking on site, just remember to speak to the concierge before heading out. 
Hopefully the pools will be available for our next visit in the future.

Service was great, breakfast a mix of western and Chinese. Currently outdoor pool is under renovation, but it's too cold to swim outside at the moment. Inside pool is open. Great play area with ball pit for kids. 
Room nice, I really wanted a bath, and I enjoyed that a lot!! Bed was so comfy.
Would consider a summer stay to relax by the pool outdoors.

The room size is big, bathroom comes with a shower area and a bath, the staff is super helpful and friendly and some of them can even speak English, the interior pool is so big and clean and there is a gym, a sauna, a steam room and a spa area. We saw the beautiful fireworks during the Chinese spring festival holiday. How beautiful it was. Wow this hotel I can safely recommend to all my friends. The hotel smells amazing and is extremely clean and neat. There was also   mini fridge in our room. We got a free upgrade to deluxe.  We had such a nice time that we didnt  even  wanna leave.

We went for lunch on the first day and found out we can’t charge anything to our room because we didn’t have a deposit which was never asked from us at checkin. Asked for a crib when I made the booking, asked again for a crib when I checked in, then had to call front desk later because we still didn’t have a crib for our baby. Balcony door in the room doesn’t open. We were put into a area around the bar for breakfast buffet, however the selection was limited compared to the main restaurant area which had more options. You also need to find a table yourself at breakfast and make sure someone stays at the table at all times otherwise it is taken by others. Overall nice hotel if you can’t leave and there for 1-2nights.

The hotel building and facilities are luxurious and impressive. The staff is well trained and welcoming. The room are big, and the room price is reasonable. The food quality is exceptional, excellent. The playground for the kids could be improved. The outdoor swimming pool is nice and kids enjoyed it. However in the weekend it becomes packed, also because half of the swimming pool is forbidden to kids. Indeed we did not understand why of the above rules if the kids are well trained in swimming or/and accompanied by the parents. Beside of this, a great stay.

The parking service staff of this hotel is really not good. They don't ask whether you are staying in the hotel, just arrange a parking space casually, and speak casually.

I have forwarded the video I took to the Shanghai Health Education Promotion Association for reporting. The relevant units will send people to conduct unannounced visits from time to time. If it is verified again, there will be a fine of 30,000 RMB.

msg:The hotel is built in the style of the Spanish Alhambra, with exquisite details. For me who likes European architecture, I really came to the right place, and I met the blue sky to help take pictures! The lobby is also very impressive! When I met the service staff in the hotel, they all took the initiative to say hello and were very friendly. The front desk helped to upgrade to a deluxe king-size room with a balcony view. The only drawback is that I always feel a little smell when I enter the room. The room temperature is maintained at 28 degrees, and the air conditioner can't be turned down. The overall stay experience is good, recommended!

Service: From the moment you get out of the car door, the doorman gives you a very comfortable feeling! Enthusiastic and thoughtful! The house keeping service is also quite OK! The response is very fast!
Sanitation: Not bad, quite good
Environment: Not very private, because of the design between the windows of the room, there is no sense of privacy! What's exaggerated is that people in the next room can climb through the window into your room! Fortunately, it is our safe China, otherwise it would be scary
Breakfast is very rich, variety, and dining environment are good!
The location is great, very close to the exhibition hall, there is a place called Panlong Tiandi nearby, a good place to relax, there is a restaurant called Jingyuan there, you need to locate it in advance, the environment, service and dishes are first-class, very suitable for business banquets!
Then, if you are shopping, there is a store similar to Outlets within 2km, with various brands, but it seems to be closed at 9 o'clock!
Will visit again!

msg:Overall evaluation: There are some positives and negatives, the appearance is good, the facilities are passable, and the software can be improved:

Environment: The hotel is adjacent to the Xijiao Manor Madrid Bungalow Community. The appearance is still very beautiful. The lobby is magnificent. Many people take photos in front of the stairs at the entrance of the lobby. The hotel is not far from the National Exhibition Center and Panlong World. The transportation is acceptable. Maybe Because the outdoor swimming pool is under maintenance, this time I went to the most photographed courtyard area where many Internet celebrities check in and take photos, but I didn’t feel very amazing.

Facilities: The decoration style of the hotel's guest rooms is old money style. The guest rooms have basically everything that a five-star hotel should have. What surprised me is that there is no imperial concubine couch. The coffee machine in the room uses Lavasa's large capsules. To my surprise, the coffee machine malfunctioned during my stay. The capsules would get stuck in the machine after use. Even after the maintenance staff repaired it once, it still couldn't be used. Solve the problem; it is worth mentioning that the hotel's internal soundproofing does not seem to be very good, and you can hear the conversations of travelers in the corridor at night. I didn't experience the hotel's gym and swimming pool this time, but I took a quick look at the gym and found that the equipment was quite complete.

Service: Generally speaking, I feel that the hotel's service is pretty good. The front desk is quite enthusiastic and the response speed of the service is acceptable. However, as a guest in an executive room, I feel regretful about two things: First, the executive lounge on the 12th floor is under maintenance. As a result, the executive lounge benefits can only be experienced in the lobby bar, and the lobby bar is on the first floor. The scenery is definitely incomparable with the executive corridor on the 12th floor. Secondly, the hotel's afternoon tea and happy hour are not buffets or orders, but It's a set meal. Although the taste is acceptable, the experience is not very good. If you have no special obsession with the room type and floor, it is recommended to choose the executive room carefully.

Let’s talk about the hotel’s breakfast buffet, which combines Chinese and Western styles. It is very rich in variety and comes with some local Shanghai delicacies such as pan-fried buns, steamed dumplings, scallion noodles, etc. The staff are warm and polite and will ask if you need tea or coffee.

The fact is that there are wheels to put together, we put them together ourselves, and moved them back before checking out.
The hotel swimming pool is very clean, there is a paddling pool for children, and there are a few inflatable balls in the outdoor swimming pool which are fun and affordable.

The view from the room is really amazing. The hotel services and facilities are amazing!!! A great place to take photos and check in, highly recommended! The 24-hour gym and swimming pool are also very large. The rooms for our group are also very close to each other. We are very grateful to Manager Ma for his help in making arrangements in advance.

The standard set can enjoy the trea**ent of the executive lounge. The afternoon tea is okay, which is quite normal. The happy hour at night is a set meal , Poor review, the rice is hard, and the roasted duck with shrimp is the leftovers from the buffet and then reheated for us to eat. The taste of this dish is very bad. I don’t know how long it has been. It’s better not to give it away, and it can only be served on the spot Eat, children are not allowed to take drinks to the room if they can’t finish them all at once. Since it is included in our room, it is ours. This administrative trea**ent is not self-service, it is per person, and it is fine if you can’t take it away I can't even have a glass of juice. It's really brain-dead. The breakfast tastes mediocre, but there are freshly squeezed juices, which is a bonus. The children's playground is on the basement floor. It's stuffy and hot. The air is not good, and there are almost no things for children to play in. Compared with the photos posted by other guests in the past, there are wooden cars, tracks, and gliding cars, but now there are no more. Overall, it is still good.

Unexpectedly, the double room was upgraded to a standard suite. The space is quite open, and the children and the elderly were very pleasantly surprised. The decoration of the hotel is mainly in warm white, which looks very warm, and the hardware facilities are also well maintained, especially the tile joints in the bathroom are very particular, and they are washed very clean, which I personally think is very good. The service of the hotel is also very good. The child burned his mouth in the restaurant due to his own reasons. The waiter brought ice cubes professionally. A passing sales manager saw the child crying and asked patiently. Finally, he gave us ice cream. First, it relieved the burn, and second, it comforted the child. It was a very pleasant stay for three days and two nights.

The child secretly told my mother that it was too revealing, and I said it was just showing my back, but when I looked carefully, it was not so simple, it was already exposed! Although it is generally not noticed, this is the only way to the swimming pool. There are so many children, children and teenagers during the summer vacation, it is really inappropriate! Hope it can be replaced soon. Another point to mention is that all the mosaics on the floor of the outdoor swimming pool were chiseled off, and the floor of the pool was covered with small pieces of mosaic tiles. If you step on the pool, you will say it is scum, let alone it will be broken if you step on it. The phenomenon of skin, the water is also very cloudy. Summer vacation is the peak time for children to play, and there are no safety measures for this. Has the hotel considered it?

Next, let’s talk about some problems I encountered on the day of my stay. Due to the pool party held on the Dragon Boat Festival that day (outdoors are not open to the inside), residents can use the indoor swimming pool for free, and something made me very uncomfortable when I was in the children’s pool. There was a family of children playing with an electric boat on the road in the small children's pool. The bow of the boat circled in circles in the pool. I told the management lifeguard next to the situation, and the reply was "It's okay, the bow is light and soft. ". As hotel service and security personnel, no training? When four or five children are playing in the hotel's small swimming pool, let's play electric boats? Is this the security awareness of your hotel? Then I went out and informed the front desk of the swimming pool, and it was resolved later. The front desk said that it was not possible to play. Hope you pay attention! The training is good for training. Don't regret anything.
Went to the outdoor swimming pool during the day the next day, because yesterday's party was not cleaned in time, it was really dirty, there was all kinds of rubbish in the water! Took a few photos and left.
I hope the hotel will strengthen the management of some facilities and the training of service personnel!
Generally speaking, other aspects are good.

First impression of the hotel: Tall and elegant, the surrounding environment is elegant, and there are many green vegetation! The hotel is well-equipped, clean and tidy, with a free heated swimming pool and gym. There are mostly children in the swimming pool, and the gym prohibits children from entering. I went to the gym twice and it was deserted and there were no people. It may be due to the coach's fierceness. It seemed that there was no discussion. When I entered the gym for the second time, I actually asked if I was staying here. I'm really speechless... This is the only bad thing, and I'm satisfied with everything else.
Ps: The house faces south, and each room has a small balcony that can be pushed out. The south room faces the National Convention Center, and the north room faces the outdoor swimming pool and a large lawn. Which direction you like can call in advance to book a room. The service attitude in the store is very good, you can check in early and check out late! Great for family outings!

Only the security guards who wear glasses look at people with colored glasses! All the other security guards are Mr. You, but he is the only one! Is it wrong for me to like to drive a battery car? Is it not possible to drive a battery car to a five-star hotel? If you drive a battery car, you will be pointed at loudly, so you can't drive it? Not even a title! I don't know how the hotel trains! Let him have such discrimination! I went to complain and got the result that the people who drive the battery cars are all employees! The employee who said this deserved to be pointed at the nose? is prejudiced? I really don't know what to think of this answer! I hope the hotel will take this issue seriously and deal with it seriously! A five-star hotel shouldn't have such an attitude!

msg:This hotel is very close to Hongqiao Airport, take taxi 38, the driver took a detour. I looked at the map and it was only about 25 yuan. I arrived at one o'clock in the morning, so I didn't talk nonsense with him. The style of the hotel is Spanish, and there is an outdoor swimming pool downstairs. There is a gym and a barbershop on the ba*****t floor. The prices for massages are quite amazing. There are bathtubs, showers, double washbasins, and bathrobes in the room. But there are too many cabinets in the room, which is somewhat smelly. There is a balcony in the room, which is quite good. . More than 600 prices, no breakfast, bad reviews, such a remote place, where can people go to eat! It costs about 200 yuan to take a taxi to the Bund during peak hours, and 120 yuan if there is no traffic jam. You can see the distance. Therefore, when you choose a hotel, you should not just look at the price. In a big city, try to choose a hotel that is close to the living circle. Otherwise, the hidden cost is very high. I went there twice in the middle, and the taxi fare was more than 600 yuan. The bed is big and comfortable. The room is clean and tidy. You can consider doing business at Hongqiao. If you are traveling, I suggest Puxi Bund, near Lujiazui. Babies, that's all for now.

There are indoor swimming, sweat steaming, fitness... just focus on this, as long as the children feel happy! The hotel is in the manor in the western suburbs. It has a European style when you walk in. There is a red carpet and a long ladder, which feels like walking on a red carpet! The room is not big, but it is quite clean. The balcony can be opened after the front desk said. The scenery in the distance is not bad, but I am a little disappointed in the rainy days these days! There is breakfast in the morning, but there are too few varieties...not particularly ideal (needs to be improved)! The room service aunts are very good 👌 enthusiastic and in place! You can consider coming again after the summer vacation... (It turns out that the double bed "high-end, luxury, and executive" is related to the floor 😉)

The Spanish architectural style, the Mediterranean romantic style, and the beach garden are very distinctive. It is a blockbuster to take a picture around it. The rooms are spacious and clean, and you can see the blue pool below when you open the balcony, which is very eye-catching...
When we checked in, the lady at the front desk, Ma Jia, received us very proactively and enthusiastically. She arranged everything for us properly and gave the baby a stuffed bear. Especially when I got home and found that I forgot my clothes at the hotel and contacted the front desk. It was Ma Jia who helped me deal with it and delivered it to my home, thank you so much 🙏
There are also many varieties of buffet dinner in the hotel, such as seafood, grilled lamb chops, steaks, etc... There are also small hot pots, and sukiyaki is my favorite. Breakfast is also good, everything you need is available.
This time we went on a weekday. The children's playground will not open until the weekend. It's a pity that the baby didn't play well... When the weather is hot, we must take the baby to this hotel for a second visit and play in the outdoor pool

The room is even more clean and comfortable. It is worth mentioning the service of the hotel. When I checked in, the service provided by Manager Jia at the front desk was very good, professional and warm. I accidentally left my clothes and razor at the hotel when I left. The hotel was very attentive and sent the items back to me after contacting me. Thank you for choosing this hotel next time.

Manager Jia was already waiting at the door when I arrived at the hotel that day. She took me through the check-in process and gave the child a small dinosaur doll. Son was pleasantly surprised. The hotel environment is good, the room is spacious and airy. The hotel slippers are of good quality and comfortable to wear. What is surprising is the service. Nowadays, it is rare for high-end hotels to really serve with heart. Thank you again for Mia Jia's family-like caring service.

msg:The housekeeping depar**ent of the hotel should train their staff well! I stayed for two days, and it was less than 2 noon on the first day. I knocked on the door and urged me to clean the room! When I came back, I didn’t replenish my toothbrush, I didn’t throw away half of the water I drank, and I didn’t wipe the table. At 9:45 this morning, I actually rang the doorbell to urge cleaning. I told the customer service that I was coming in the afternoon, and asked me what time I was leaving! I'm not willing to say that I just change something. No wonder the desktop was not wiped, and the minimum cleaning is not worthy of the extended stay. Do your employees have basic etiquette training! Even if I don't stay longer, is it possible that the guests didn't get up at 9:45, do I need to ring the doorbell and ask the guests about the itinerary for my own convenience? It's really that the housekeeping depar**ent has wiped out the good influence accumulated by other depar**ents. The restaurant in the front lobby is very good, but the most important thing is to have a good rest

msg:The hotel environment is okay. Most rooms have balconies. South-facing rooms face the road, which can be a bit noisy; north-facing rooms are quieter and look at the outdoor swimming pool - different orientations have their own advantages and disadvantages. The breakfast is so-so. Children above 140 will be charged as adults, and after the discount, it will cost more than 100 per person. One meal for one adult and one child will cost more than 300, which is not worth it. The front desk is more arrogant, maybe I have seen too many upper-level people, and I am also more noble.
      Stayed for four nights and five days. On the first day, a staff member swiped his card to enter the room without knocking on the door. When he found someone, he immediately asked, "Do you want a drink?" - Funny, do you need to come in without knocking and swiping your card when selling drinks? When I returned to the room the next day, I found that my aunt had missed the bottled drinking water after cleaning. I had to call to ask for a refill. I said I wanted four big bottles, but I got four small bottles... Before going out on the third day, I called to ask for a change of the bedding coat. But when I came back, I found that the bedding hadn’t been changed... On the fourth day, I watched the auntie operate, and finally changed the bedding jacket; it was commendable that it was raining at night, and people were outside, so I called the hotel to help collect the clothes that were drying on the balcony, and promptly I did.
      The last thing to emphasize is that his family cannot check out late! Although Ctrip indicated that the hotel can "late check-out", the application was delayed when checking out on the same day, and was rejected by the front desk. The reason was that there would be a large number of groups checking in in the afternoon, and the room needed to be cleaned early...Since the business is so prosperous, the personal feelings of the guests can be ignored. I will not consider his family next time, thank you!

msg:At the end of the summer vacation, I chose the Radisson Blu Hotel Hongqiao, which has an outdoor swimming pool. When I arrived at the hotel, it was already a little late at 3:30 in the afternoon. With the mentality of trying it out, I asked the lady at the front desk if she could upgrade the room type for free. The lady said that she could help me to check. Room twin room. I had a good impression of this young lady, and quietly saw the name of the young lady's brand name Jessica. After checking in, the young lady said that she could contact her at any time if there was anything. During the stay, I had to contact Miss Jessica about the arrangements for the entry and exit of the vehicle after leaving the hotel and coming back, where is the nucleic acid testing point, and the next day's late check-out. She quickly helped me make arrangements and gave us a lot of convenience. Thumbs up for her service!
The hotel environment is still very a**ospheric, European-style architectural style, the room environment is clean, the disadvantage is that there is no sofa in the room, there are many children in the summer vacation, all the rooms with balconies are locked, and for safety reasons, you cannot enjoy the scenery from the balcony. It's a pity.
🌴🏊🏻‍♂️ The most popular outdoor swimming pool for children, the water is not very deep, the children have a good time, there is a bubble party at the hour, and it is a happy bubble time. There are very few play items in the Madrid Parent-Child Paradise. It is best to rectify it and add more play items for children. In this way, children can have other activities besides playing with water.

Especially in the swimming pool, there are a lot of security guards, which is more reassuring, and there is also a place to play with bubbles. Not bad👍 The hotel is very new, the facilities are also great, and the food is also good. There are two deficiencies, 1. There are many places where children play with extra charges. 2. In the room, for example, toothbrushes need to be called before they are delivered, and the front desk did not explain...

Room and hygiene: The room is not very big, the toilet is very spacious, but the room has a musty smell, which may be the smell of carpet
I want to mention that I pulled a black ba facial cleanser in the toilet shower room, but when I went to communicate on the phone, it was reported that there were no conscious items. This is doubtful, because the luggage I brought this time is very simple, and the rooms have been checked except for the shower room, because things It's not cheap, so I'm not very comfortable

In the cool breeze in the evening, the children were playing in the water until they refused to go ashore [applause], but who would have thought that they were almost locked in the hotel at noon today 😅 I was swimming in the pool when I suddenly heard someone shouting: The hotel is about to be closed, hurry up! I pulled my sister to the shore calmly, went into the bathroom to take a shower, and thought to myself: If the hotel is really closed, I can't get out! After taking a bath, the staff urged us to leave quickly, and we won't be able to leave after the disease control comes. She quickly dragged her sister and rushed back to the room, calling her brother to pack up and leave. As a result, my brother said: I just received a call to evacuate, I thought it was a liar and hung up. . . Really convinced the silly son [covers face] Fortunately, we are already sitting in the car going back now, and my brother excitedly said that there is one more composition material. . . #I wonder if I could have waived the bill if I hadn't paid for the room at the front desk yesterday

There are a few complaints:
1. When I arrived at the front desk, the concierge said that I could park in the underground parking lot, but I drove over and had to go back (the concierge and parking were not communicated in time)
2. There are sharp steps in the swimming pool, and my husband's knees were scraped. Here comes the point. The so-called medical box only has band-aids, and there is no disinfection equipment. The person in charge also waited for a while before coming
3. The parent-child park is even more of a pitfall. Basically, you have to pay, so it is very deserted, a bit like **, not "fun"
4. The breakfast is very unpalatable, and there is no seat, which cannot meet the 5-star standard
5. There are a lot of sand and branches at the bottom of the outdoor swimming pool, which were not cleaned in time
6. The little yellow duck in the room was not cleaned up, and a lot of old sewage came out when squeezed, so I had to change the water in the baby's bathtub
There are also a few advantages:
1. The concierge service attitude is good, and the concierge car is very powerful
2. The hotel design is good and it is beautiful
3. The bubble activity is good, and the baby is happy

What about the sign that you are not allowed to eat in the lobby? Haha a country hotel has nothing to do with luxury. We don't care about that much anymore, Ma Liu will never go home again.

Environment: The outdoor swimming pool is the highlight. It is relatively large and has many partitions. It will not appear crowded. There is a bubble party time. There is a small sand pool. The children are very happy. The indoor swimming pool is also very clean. There is a small carpeted building block place in the children's park and a very small kart venue. Several doll machines (dolls of average quality) need to be charged separately except for building blocks. It is not recommended to go. Three meals a day are solved in the hotel, the Chinese restaurant tastes good, the buffet breakfast and dinner dishes are not rich, the taste is average, but you can try it for convenience. (On the afternoon of 7.20, the happy hour afternoon tea and the little fat brother who was on duty in the Chinese restaurant at noon on 7.21 are the only hotel employees in the hotel who feel that they have a service attitude.)

Front desk service: I have to say that the service of this hotel is beyond compliments. Check-in in the lobby does not seem to welcome guests. There is no introduction to check-in facilities at all. What time is breakfast at, what time is included in the package, ask a question and answer a question, love the answer and ignore it, and even more outrageous is to let yourself go to the restaurant and ask yes Not sure about the wrong time. Afternoon tea, buffet and Chinese restaurant are in different restaurants, you need to ask them one by one. It may also be that you look down on your Ctrip customers. Not a single parent-child hotel reflects the care for children. The carpet in the room is wet and the air conditioner smells. After changing a room, the situation is still the same. After changing the room, the guest information has not been changed, and it is very impatient to update the information. The room card is invalid and said that there is no problem with the computer inquiries. I went to the elevator to try it, but it didn't work. I didn't propose to change it. I just kept stressing that the card was no problem.

Recreation service: The lady who is on duty at 7.20pm at the Recreation Front is extremely impatient. Before going swimming, I want to inquire about the locker rental process. They contemptuously say that we don't borrow anything here. In fact, the process is to open the locker by borrowing a bracelet. Simply speechless. There is no advance notice of where to go, you have to ask yourself one by one.

Anyway, on the first day of my stay, I felt like it was a self-service hotel, and I had to rely on myself.

Before checking out, I wanted to go to the Chinese restaurant to reserve a seat for lunch and then go home. The person in charge of the short-haired lady in the restaurant (doesn't know if the short-haired lady who checked in was the same person) told me that I didn't have a location before I came to see it. Why did the little chubby ask to book a seat yesterday with a warm attitude? Today, I changed my face when I changed people...

There are many parent-child hotels in Shanghai, and many have outdoor swimming pools. Everyone has come to check in because of the epidemic. It is recommended to strengthen staff service awareness training. I will check in again.

As a parent-child hotel, there is no urinal for a baby in the men's toilet, which is disappointing. 3. Children's Paradise, only movies and construction are free, the rest are all charged, and there are few items. The most important thing is that the taste is great.

You can play with confidence. Special thanks to Miss Ma Jia at the front desk of the hotel, she was very patient. I didn’t pay attention to the fact that the package included several packages at first. Under her introduction, I found that this package was properly arranged for meals and lodging this time.

The outdoor swimming pool is a feature, and there are bubbles at 3 o'clock in the afternoon and 5 o'clock in the afternoon
However, the outdoor swimming pool closes at 7 o'clock, which is a bit early.
There is not much to eat near the hotel, mainly rely on takeaway

It's a pity that the outdoor swimming pool is being renovated. I didn't pay attention to it when I booked it. It will be open almost next week. Although it can only be played indoors, the facilities inside are also readily available. Swimming pools, hot springs, saunas, fitness, and the newly established children's playground, there are also many projects. It is much richer than the single slide last year, as well as go-kart driving, claw machine and so on. The service of the check in staff at the front desk is also very good. I have told my family that I will bring my baby to play when the outdoor swimming pool is open. Also recommend it to your colleagues and friends. Whether taking pictures, leisure, here is the best choice👍

The international friend who was participating in the event next to me covered the slipping place with a towel in time to prevent more people from slipping. Until we questioned him, the service staff still quibble about it. I have been reminded of the situation here, but why not deal with it in time. If it is an elderly person who falls, it can be a big or small thing. I still hope that the hotel can do more training on the attitude of the staff and how to handle things, thank you!

msg:In order to let my mother have an unforgettable birthday this time, my mother decided to take the baby to stay in the hotel, so I chose this hotel. After staying in the hotel happily with my parents and baby, I thought it would be a good memory. My mom and dad brought the shadow of this lifetime to the hotel industry!

I checked in at the hotel on February 17, 2022. Because I booked a suite, I was very much looking forward to my mother's response. After my mother entered the room, she was very happy and said that she was very happy to live in the hotel with her baby on her birthday this year! After entering the room, I asked if I could drink the beverages in the refrigerator. The front desk answered yes, because the family ordered takeout and it was easy to solve. After eating, my husband and I left the hotel with confidence. I ordered takeout for my parents that night. Because the nearby shopping mall is far away, it is inconvenient for them to travel. As a result, the takeaway arrived very late and it was cold because of the weather. I was worried that they would be too hungry with the baby and ordered it in the hotel. Ordered a fried rice worth 108 yuan, this fried rice tastes really good!

On February 18, 2022, my parents went to the restaurant to eat early in the morning. The food in the restaurant was a bit small. When my parents took their children around the hotel and found a place for afternoon tea, my mother asked me, and I asked the staff to ask, indeed Yes, my mother went to ask the front desk. The attitude of the front desk was so bad that I was speechless. Because it was the second day of my stay, my mother asked the front desk for afternoon tea time. After checking out, I can’t enjoy afternoon tea. After my mother asked again and again, I found out that the suite and dinner I ordered this time were also provided in the suite. As a result, I communicated with the hotel and asked the staff to come to the room with my parents. For communication, the hotel sent the staff to the door with a friendly attitude, but the result of solving the problem is maddening! I very much question whether the hotel has professional training, how to deal with the problem and how to receive the guests staying in the hotel? Because the staff admitted that they did not explain clearly at work, my parents did not enjoy the trea**ent of the suite, so they promised to check out the next day until 16:30 pm. My parents also told the hotel staff that the baby needs to take a nap in the afternoon. My parents enjoyed dinner at the hotel that night.

February 19, 2022 is the day of check-out. After the meal, my parents went back to the room to pack their luggage. In the afternoon, it was time for the baby to sleep. The cleaning aunt of the hotel rang the doorbell at one o'clock in the afternoon and asked to clean the room. My parents told me to clean the room. Auntie, the hotel has already made arrangements for this room to be checked out at 16:30. The front desk of the hotel called the room at 13:30 and told them why they didn’t check out? Hehe, I woke up my daughter directly in her sleep, and the child was there because she was woken up!

Here I want to talk about my deep feelings about this hotel. First, when I check in the hotel, the front desk should tell me what trea**ent I should enjoy in the hotel. I told her that if there are any problems in the hotel, I can find her to solve it, and the result is hehe; third, the guests staying in the hotel facilities should enjoy it for free. The children's playground is closed on weekdays and only open on weekends; fourth, I I would like to ask the owner of the hotel and various shareholders, how do you recruit employees? How to carry out hotel management training? How are the front desk staff trained? How to train and communicate with the guests?

The staff of the hotel WeChat and the manager of the hotel communicated with me, which made me really want to call 12345 to file a complaint. I was so angry that I was speechless!
Finally, a big thank you to the Radisson Blu Hotel, Shanghai Hongqiao Manor for giving my mother such an unforgettable birthday, so don't blame me for giving a bad review! I'm really speechless!

After all, according to the package price, it is only more than 100 per person.
Service and hygiene are relatively standard five-star level
It's quite satisfactory, not too amazing, and not pulling the crotch.
Disadvantages There are not many supporting businesses within 2 kilometers of the surrounding area
Secondly, the variety of breakfast is acceptable, but the West Point is slightly worse than the five-star standard
Generally speaking, the price is ok for the Spring Festival holiday.

The gym has a lot of equipment, and facing the outdoor swimming pool, the flow of people is not much contracted by our family, haha.
The price is still very favorable, and it is considered a high cost performance in Shanghai.
Breakfast: The food is still quite rich. I ordered take-out for lunch. It is recommended to configure a take-out cabinet at the entrance of the hotel lobby for the convenience of riders and customers. Otherwise, I just took a shower and couldn’t pick it up right away. The rider was in a hurry to take the next order, and I was embarrassed to keep him waiting, but there was no place to temporarily put it. I hope the hotel can consider this suggestion from the customer’s perspective. Or equipped with a robot. The last time I stayed in other hotels, robots delivered food.
🚗 Transportation: Convenient, very close to Hongqiao.
🧹Hygiene: Very clean.
🍃Environment: So quiet and beautiful, the hotel's outdoor garden seems to be in a foreign country.
🔔Service: Humanized service feels very comfortable.

The overall style of the hotel is a European-style building. Each room has a large space and a large balcony. There may be more people during the New Year's Day. The room is not facing the interior swimming pool and the view is not so good. It would be better if there were more entertainment facilities, such as KTV or something, for children to play, and older friends to entertain.

The hotel's hardware facilities are luxurious, and the hotel staff are very warm and friendly. The guest relations manager, Ms. Jia, arranged a free upgrade for our room and also gave us a small gift. The room was very clean and had a balcony. Although the room smelled of cigarette smoke from the previous guest, the customer service immediately followed up and took measures to open the balcony and remove the cigarette smell. The service was quite timely. The package we ordered has a minibar to use, which is very cost-effective. You can stand on the balcony of the room and overlook the swimming pool. The photos are very beautiful. Because it is Chris**as, the price of 808 is a bit more expensive than usual, but it is worth it. What is particularly worth mentioning is the coffee in the restaurant. The restaurant manager specially made the coffee with Chris**as patterns for me. Halfway through the drink, the pattern was still there, so I liked it. I thought it was winter and the outdoor swimming pool was closed, so I planned to come back with the kids for a night in the summer.

msg:On their wedding anniversary, my husband and I chose the hotel Xijiao Manor 🏨 want to see such a building. We ordered the package on Ctrip, which includes 2 buffet breakfast and buffet dinner.
Checked in at about two o'clock that day, the sister at the front desk was very kind, asking if it was the first time we were staying, and we were upgraded to an executive double room. The check-in was very pleasant. You can pick up toiletries at the front desk, and you can bring your own if you are environmentally friendly.
When you enter the room, it is not very big, but it is very clean and tidy. It is also very quiet. The room has a balcony and you can see the most representative outdoor swimming pool and white beach, which makes people feel happy.
In the evening, we went to enjoy the hotel's buffet dinner, which is the season of hairy crabs. Each person presented a drunk crab and a steamed hairy crab. There is also a small hot pot to choose from.
I was surprised that this Southeast Asian cuisine is very good. It is very friendly to me who loves curry, and the yellow curry is full of seafood, which is very fresh and super tasty.
In addition to seafood curry, there is also vegetable curry to choose from. Green curry with vegetables is also very tasty! The quality of their dishes is still very good, the desserts are average, and the ice cream is okay.
I was also very impressed by their sausages, not breakfast sausages, but cheese sausages that burst juice. It was super delicious, but it satiated me all at once.
Then the night scene is really beautiful! When I went back to the room to rest, I found that their shampoo was very good. Even after washing, it was not dry. I liked it very much. I slept satisfactorily for one night, and the soundproofing effect is super good! very quiet.
I have seen the Internet saying that their breakfast coffee is very special. Go for breakfast early, and of course you will have two cups!
The very speechless thing is that you can’t wear hotel slippers for breakfast, and you have to run back to your room to change... Isn’t it possible to wear slippers to eat? ! ! ! Big speechless 😓 I have to wear Bibi to eat...it really affects my good mood throughout the day
For breakfast, there are a lot of porridge, bean curd, steamed buns, fried dough sticks, dumplings, etc. Generally speaking, there are more Chinese dishes, suitable for older people, children, or friends who like Chinese breakfast, but not for those who like Western food. friendly. Not many kinds of fruits are the same as dinner. The coffee is still very good, it's all beautifully drawn.
Miss sister gave us a late check-out until 14:00. I will choose when I have the opportunity in the future. I hope I can wear slippers for breakfast next time...

I’m too lazy to go to the restaurant on the first floor at night to eat buffet, in-house guests can go to the front desk to get a coupon discount of 100 yuan per person, one person can get a hairy crab with the ticket 🦀, the dishes are not very rich, salmon is specialized You can't take too much, the small hot pot is not bad, you can drink some hot soup and some vegetables🥬, the drinks are beer🍺 and red wine🍷, hotel buffets are almost the same! The price is not high.
The breakfast is very rich, Japanese🍣Chinese🍜Western🥐, freshly squeezed juice🍹, coffee☕️I especially like it😘, there is a barista named Cindy who will help you make latte coffee according to your request☕️, my husband and I each ordered a cup Hot chocolate and mocha, it tastes good too👍
Because the birthday cake from the hotel can’t be eaten, I don’t want to waste it. I want to pack it back to eat. I called the restaurant and asked for a packing box. A female waiter 💁🏼 answered the phone and told me that no packing box was provided. I couldn’t help but ask for dinner in the restaurant at night. The waiter💁‍♂️is there a packing box for one? He immediately went to help me and got one for me. The two waiters in the same restaurant answered completely differently. It was too strange. Why did he lie to the customer if there was a packing box? Really upset 😕
Check out is also very fast, go to the welcome desk to report the license plate number, and free parking is available for in-house guests.

msg:Location 🧭: It is very close to Hongqiao Railway Station and the airport. Because I want to fly to Chongqing the next day, I chose a hotel a little closer to the airport. I didn’t expect to find the treasure 🪙It’s only ten minutes drive away from Hongqiao Tiandi, which is quite convenient .
Appearance 🏨: The entire hotel is very large and beautiful. It can be seen that a lot of thought has been spent on the design. The hotel has an open-air swimming pool and garden. It is said that it is open in summer and can be launched. I want to wait until next summer to come and try it!
🅿️: Parking is also very convenient. The parking lot is very large in Shanghai, and the parking space is also very large. For a female driver like me, I like it too much 💕
Service 🙆: Anna at the front desk introduced me in detail when I checked in. The staff at the hotel were very enthusiastic, and they would take the initiative to greet me no matter in the lobby or in the elevator. I usually book an executive room when I travel, and I feel the different executive lounge styles by the way. Although this restaurant does not have many types of food, it has everything that should be there. There is a terrace that is quite distinctive and you can see the panoramic view of the hotel, but it will not rain. It’s a pity to sit outside. It must be very pleasant when the weather is good. The service in the lounge is very professional. Whether we go in or leave, Manager Ma Jia will greet us kindly, even write down our name and help press the elevator , The experience is really good👍Highly recommend everyone!
Breakfast🥣: Sure enough, it is wise to avoid the National Day holiday. The difference can be clearly felt from the restaurant😂 There are fewer people, quiet and not messy, you can enjoy breakfast leisurely, and the quality of the food is also good.

msg:The hotel environment is indeed very good. The executive room is set, and it feels that there is no difference between the high floor and the double bed room. The executive lounge is open from noon to 9 pm. There are too few types of food. Breakfast is on the first floor. Due to too many people So let’s go to the coffee shop nearby. There are still not many types of food. Compared with other five-stars, it is indeed a bit worse in terms of eating. The parent-child park is a bit low, the indoor and outdoor swimming pools and gyms are good, and the scenery is good to take pictures.

You can see the outdoor swimming pool and the artificial beach and fountain waterfall from the balcony. The room, the little grandson is very happy. We want to thank the beautiful lady at the front desk for receiving Emily’s care and thoughtfulness. Both dinner and breakfast the next day are buffets eaten in the hotel. The variety of dishes is richer and suits my taste. Check out at the second noon. The doorman concierge at the front desk receives the room attendant, the restaurant attendant, and the recreation center attendants are more active and enthusiastic. The grandson said that he would continue to play next time.

🔔Service: slightly worse, the waiters are not very enthusiastic, neither the restaurant on the first floor nor the executive lounge actively serve them. The lounge only opens in the afternoon and only provides afternoon tea and evening snacks.
🚗 Transportation: It will be more convenient to drive by yourself. There are parking spaces and plenty of space, but you have to talk about it every time you get in and out, which is not very convenient.
🍜Meals: There are very few things in the lounge, and the taste is average, meaningless. The breakfast place on the first floor is not too big, but the variety is relatively rich, but the insulation is not very good, there are no people in the morning, but the things are a bit cool.

msg:Since the epidemic was unable to go out of Shanghai last year, almost all major hotels in Shanghai have been to experience it. Radisson is one of the hotels that left a deep impression after going there. The Spanish architectural style design, coupled with the large outdoor swimming pool, won my heart! This time I brought the two old men to experience it. When I checked in, I hoped I could live in a room with a view of the swimming pool. Because my parents were old and my legs were inconvenient, the little Jia at the front desk of the hotel helped me for a long time in order to satisfy my wish. Finally, I helped us upgrade and found two connected rooms, thank you very much! The two elders can enjoy the European architecture, large swimming pool, white sandy beach and beautiful night view in the room. They are very happy. We will come again next summer!

msg:Stay for three days and two nights, share it🌹
Room: In fact, it's pretty good, and the bathroom arrangement is reasonable. I like this kind of independence~ It doesn't affect the children's rest. The balcony door can't be opened. In fact, it is slightly deducted. It may be better to be able to open.
Food: The buffet breakfast and dinner are of good quality, and I personally like it. The quality of hotel buffets is uneven now, this one is considered to be a mid-to-upper level, with a wide range of varieties to tastes, it is worth a try
Facilities: The only facilities I gave 4🌟, mainly for family hotels, indoor and outdoor swimming pools have no choice, if the indoor amu*****t park is a bit sincere, it may be even more points.
Service: We went to two families, and I arrived early with two babies because of the birthday note, and arranged a little surprise outside the room 🍰 birthday cake! Thank you again ♥️

Overall it feels great! Suitable for bringing a baby~ If the epidemic continues, this is definitely the first choice for parent-child hotels in Shanghai! (I have been to a certain parent-child hotel in Sheshan a few years ago, but I had to complain about the quality and service year after year.)

It’s very convenient to drive there~

parking:
The underground parking lot is huge~convenient

service:
The waitress in the black suit who checked in at the front desk had a bad attitude and was not very kind! Don't look up, need training!

Room view:
Directly see the outdoor swimming pool, the view is superb! However, the balcony of the room is locked. You must apply for and sign the exemption form with the hotel to open it!

Room facilities:
The room is not bad, there is everything! The quilt is a bit thick!

breakfast:
General, but still full, but the pastry needs to be improved!

swimming pool:
It’s just for the hotel’s outdoor swimming pool. It’s really awesome to take the kids to play. The environment is very beautiful. It’s a special film, and there is white sand for kids to play! Will come for this pool in the future!
The mini bar included in the hotel package is a good deal, and the drinks and beverages in the room are free to drink, which is a big thumbs up-booking a hotel at Ctrip is especially value-for-money!
Generally speaking, it is especially suitable for bringing children to play. You can feel the feeling of vacation even if the epidemic situation is not out of Shanghai. It is very good ~ the hotel lobby is magnificent and the scenery outside the hotel is pleasant. There is also a commercial street within a 14-minute walk, where there is a lot of food! So recommend [naughty]

msg:The summer vacation is coming to an end and I can’t go out of Shanghai. What should I do if Sheshan and Sun Island can’t be booked?
Before I went, I was quite disturbed. I read the reviews and there were mixed reviews, but I felt pretty good after staying for three days and two nights. The waiters are very polite, and the hygiene is not bad. I don’t know if the quilt is 380 or not, but the delivery service is more expensive. Basically 88/108 is a simple meal, not for those who are inconvenient to eat out with children. Friendly, takeaways can't be placed at the front desk and have to go downstairs in time to get them.
Send something useful. I came to this hotel mainly for playing in the sand and water, which is still satisfying. Both indoor and outdoor swimming pools are good, the indoor children's pool is not too high, and relatively small, it is mainly to play outdoor. However, there is a small bubble pool inside the women's watch. You can go in for a bath when it is cold outside. There are also dry steaming and wet steaming rooms. There is a beach, not too big, the photos are all, and it is white sand. It is not recommended to play when the sun is in the sun, or wear sunglasses, which is too dazzling. The children's playground has ocean balls, building blocks and archery, which are relatively small and simple, as well as paid karts. Generally suitable for playing with children in summer. Both children like it very much and are willing to come

The photos of the outdoor swimming pool are very attractive, which actually fits the seller's show and the buyer's show.
There are still a lot of people in parent-child hotels during summer vacation. It takes some time to line up for check-in and check-out. We are about 10 minutes.
The reservation includes afternoon tea for two people, two large and two small portions are enough to eat, eat and drink enough, accompany the small pots of friends outdoor playing in the water, fun in the hot summer, sun and sun, good sunscreen is necessary, so there is no sun Black [smile]
There is a standard swimming pool with a shallow water area and a deep water area of 1.6m. There is also a paddling pool, which requires a swimming cap.
The outdoor swimming pool is also a paddling pool, the shallow water area is slowly deep water area, and the sand playing area is on the deep water area, so it is surrounded by guardrails. Sand has no soul without water, and it cannot stand up. If you are playing with sand, you still need to wear long pants. It is somewhat inconvenient to not have a faucet such as washing hands and feet.

🧹Hygienic: cleaning the room and sanitation services are okay. I would like to give special praise to the room downstairs at 11 o’clock in the evening to inform you that you need bath towels. Unexpectedly, we have seen the service staff waiting at the door before the room. This is the only thing we have encountered in the hotel. Pass the cleaning staff waiting at the door👍.
Environment: The hotel belongs to the European style and the design style belongs to the type I like, so I prefer a little bit 😆, the room is a little small, and the bathroom space is large. I like the overall style.
🔔Service: The hotel welcoming service is a bit poor, because the father-in-law’s legs and feet are inconvenient to get off the hotel on the first day and ask if it is a wheelchair 🦽, the door answered no (this is what I did not expect 😂) 5 minutes later, he said to look for it, and then push It's out (the hotel said that they didn't know if it happened the first time they encountered this situation.) This feeling gave me a bad feeling because I just checked in. There must be a wheelchair in the hotel. The service staff didn't know, but fortunately, the service staff pushed the old man up. Pulled back my attitude towards the hotel's service.

We took the electricity to the 12th floor, please ask the lobby service staff to help us swipe the card to the 12th floor. The waiter on the 12th floor said that he was an intern and would not check in. He could not contact the manager. He could not answer the phone and would not reply to WeChat. We waited for a while and did not reply. I took the elevator down to the first floor, the first floor queue, the counter processing slow, I asked a woman manager, why can't the administrative floor, she said, Oh she is an intern can't do it. I can go to the 12th floor to help you do it. At this time I arrived, I did it on the first floor, and honestly, the processing speed is slow. When I checked out, it was also that the 12th floor could not handle the check-out of the executive room, and I queued up on the first floor. I asked a male manager, we checked in and checked out on the 12th floor last year, and he said that we needed to improve. The service can't keep up with the administrative lounge at 6 o'clock in the evening. The red bean sand round son is the soup in the afternoon. It looks very thin and smashes its brand. There is a problem. Why should the administrative room counter arrange for an intern who won't handle it? In this case, why does the concierge desk also inform the 12th floor to do it? Including the service person who helped us swipe the card on the 12th floor did not remind the 12th floor that it could not be checked in. Moreover, the intern's phone and WeChat were slow to reply. Last year, we checked in and checked out on the 12th floor by a professional boy, which was very smooth. How once smooth process is so tossed, this is not very satisfied.

msg:This time it was a trip on the occasion of the advent of the "fireworks", but unfortunately the outdoor swimming pool was not available. The appearance of the hotel is tall and European. There are few guests to the hotel on typhoon days. The buffet is all Shanghainese. However, on the day of check-in, no one at the entrance of the hotel monitors their body temperature, and they did not look at the portable code when checking in. The current epidemic situation should be taken seriously. There are disinfectants at the elevator entrance and the entrance of the hotel hall, and the elevator can take up to 6 people at a time. When the doorman helped us deliver the luggage, he took the initiative to sit down when he saw that the elevator exceeded the number of people, and he had a strong awareness of epidemic prevention. The hotel currently has only one middle and self-service restaurant. Self-service restaurant, there are crayfish in the evening, but the taste is average, there are three flavors of small hot pot. Zhongxiao Restaurant still wants to order recommended dishes. I ordered a honey pork ribs, which actually tastes sweet and sour. Alas, there is no honey sauce that does not match the name. The outdoor swimming pool is not open. The indoor swimming pool is also good. There is a hot tub and sauna in the changing room. If you go early in the morning, it is basically a private room. This time I booked two superior rooms and a parent-child room. The superior room is facing the outdoor swimming pool and has a good view, but the parent-child room faces the road without a view. The advantage of the parent-child room is that the baby has a separate bed without having to squeeze it with the parents. Disadvantages, the room hygiene is generally very average. Picture 4 is the bathrobe in the parent-child room. I found out after I checked my luggage on the last day. Fortunately, I didn't wear it. There is a floor mat in the parent-child room, which is also stained, and the hygiene problem of bringing a baby is the most important. Every day I swim and hang clothes to hang in the shower room, but when I look at the shower room for cleaning, the hair on the floor drain is ignored. The awareness of hygiene services should be improved. The aunt who cleaned the room, saw our first words, not to say hello, but to ask you what day you are leaving. The hotel training needs to be improved. It's a pity that I didn't play in the outdoor pool, and I have to come again if I have a chance.

Since I know that this sacred place for strolling babies will always go once a year during summer vacation, the outdoor swimming pool outside is relatively rare in Shanghai (maybe I don't know enough), anyway, kids. I especially like thumping in the water for an afternoon soaking in the water is not too tired, the old ones. . . Prefer the bubble inside the hot spring pool.
The outdoor swimming pool closes at 8pm, and by this time young people can dig in the sand dug area again.
Talk about small bugs. Ctrip sets the night room payment for my visit. Ctrip locks in and pays the old on the spot. pos went directly to the room to find the old deduction. After checking out the next day, he called the old man and said that the room could not be checked.

msg:I brought my children to the Shanghai National Convention and Exhibition Center to participate in the comic exhibition. The hotel is very good, the decoration is very luxurious, the bedding is soft and comfortable, there are small refrigerators for snacks, the bathroom is very beautiful, the wardrobe is equipped with an iron and ironing board, and it is only two distances from the National Convention and Exhibition Center. Kilometers, easy to ride. Very satisfied with this stay! Recommend to everyone.

msg:The restaurant is very good and the service is very good
But, the swimming pool hotel guests and the owners of the Madrid bungalows can use it. It’s nothing in itself, but can the owners follow the rules a little bit and step on high heels to enter the indoor swimming pool. The children are still playing in the pool. This part is really very good. Uncomfortable
I would like to commend the aunt for cleaning, and the breakfast and dinner waiters, who did not look at the nameplate, and the short-haired eldest sister who made hand-made coffee specially

At the front desk, there is a feeling that I am an uncle and who do you love. The little brother on duty at the door at night is much cute. Breakfast is average, quite a bit worse than Xingguo, Xijiao, and Ruijin. Anyway, I don't quite understand why this one can be an Internet celebrity. The gardens of the bungalows sold next to them are more lovely than this hotel. All of the above is to be honest.

酒店很豪華也很乾凈。住店客人自助晚餐可以再打88折，比大眾點評買划算，238一人。以海鮮和小火鍋為主。
自助早餐原本想讓拉花咖啡的，服務員説假日人太多了沒辦法拉花，可以沒有喝到心中的咖啡。

很可惜的是暑假期間為了防蚊蟲不能打開陽台門，可惜了這麼美的西班牙建築風格陽台，酒店應該提供更多的解決方案給客人選擇，比如裝紗窗之類的，或者配備防蚊水，而不是一刀切的鎖掉全部陽台門，這是酒店的機會點。

餐廳海鮮自助餐划算好吃，不是指有海鮮所以划算，而是整個自助餐的菜品都挺好吃的，包括甜品，包括點心，甚至燒臘素菜炒飯
員工精神面貌好，無論前台還是餐飲，態度好，手腳快。見慣了現在好多死樣怪氣的酒店服務，這家麗笙確實是生日的驚喜，剛進去看周圍環境還以為是個為了給周邊配套湊數的酒店呢，沒想到管理和員工素質能到上海同類酒店前排。

酒店把陽台門鎖了，怕住店客人又開空調又開陽台門！
這格局真是一言難盡！怕費電，還要什麼陽台……
還有泳池更衣室：櫃子裏毛巾沒有，找個服務員連個人影都沒！這更衣室裏麪冷得跟個冰窟一樣！
還有更衣室裏麪熱水的池子也關閉，不給用了！
現在這酒店是真心差！以後就偏偏沒去過的人！

我入住的房間寬敞明亮，床鋪舒適可以得到充足的休息。房間的設施也非常齊全，都考慮得十分周到。特別值得一提的是，房間的隔音效果非常好，讓我在享受安靜的同時，不會被外界打擾。
在服務方面，酒店的員工李二寧給我留下了深刻的印象。她熱情友好，專業負責，始終以客人的需求為首要任務。無論任何問題，都能耐心細緻地為我解答，讓我感受到了家的温暖。
總體來説，這次的住宿體驗真的非常棒，從環境、設施到服務，每一個環節都讓我感受到了高品質的保證。

msg:【差評】【保潔誤扔客人物品毫無處理措施】
一，事情背景
5.2動漫展結束後，回到房間打電話叫客服收拾屋子，當時我的道具手甲包好了泡沫紙放在茶百道袋子裏，放在桌子下邊垃圾桶邊上，為了避免阿姨扔錯，我自己特意收拾了房間，垃圾都放到了門口，打電話説了衹需要:a.收拾廁所，b.更換床單，c.不需要掃屋子
22:30返回後，床單沒有換，房間裏面的垃圾桶倒過了，我們又打電話等他們來換床單，換完已經快12點了。第二天起床發現手甲和袋子沒有了。
二，處理過程
11:15打電話客房，跟我説找前台
11:25再次電話，還是説在聯繫
11:30我下樓跟前台要求處理，告訴我不要緊等個十分鐘，當時我活動已經嚴重delay，我發火了才開始打電話
11:45，打電話跟我説阿姨説沒進過房間沒看到過，開始接下來的迷惑操作【見三】
12:10，告訴我衹能送我禮品，延遲退房，我説我要去活動，我不需要延遲
12:20，到我離店，東西沒有找到，沒有賠償，活動因為裝備丟失去不了，我來上海的車票酒店全套衣服報廢。
三，幾個迷惑的點
1.踢皮球:客房讓我找前台，前台讓我找垃圾站，自始至終我沒見到客房服務經理或者當晚清掃我房間的阿姨本人，位置袋子我都記得，很可能就是拿錯了，但就是不解決，非等客人發火
2.弄丟客人東西，反而責怪客人:前台靈魂三連問我，是不是同住人拿走了，為什麼當晚沒有打電話，我為什麼沒有把東西收好而是放在桌子下
「1」我着急去活動，要是找得到，我至於跟你們在這裏耗費時間嗎？
「2」你們自己沒有按要求換床單，換完了快12點了，我還要不能睡覺提前查東西嗎？
「3」阿姨沒進我房間，所以桌子下面的垃圾袋是自己變新的？我都幫你們垃圾撿好了放門口了，然後你們自己不拆開袋子確認扔掉我的裝備，怪我？
四，總結
1.事情結果:我被酒店弄丟裝備，活動報廢，準備了幾個月的心血，幾千塊的活動成本打水漂
2.酒店問題
「1」沒有應急sop,反饋問題25分鐘，如果我不下樓發火，根本沒有接口人處理，我根本不知道找誰
「2」服務缺陷:講了要換床單不換，出了問題逃避責任找不到負責人，反過來責怪客人
「3」環境蠻好，可是衹有面子好看不行，把裡子也改改吧。東西不貴，問題是活動着急用，且是定製品，總不能仗着便宜不值錢就不處理吧。

msg:五一假期全家老小一起入住「上海虹橋西郊莊園麗笙大酒店」不出家門也能享受⛱️度假🏖的感覺🌴
酒店以西班牙格拉納達的阿爾罕布拉式建築為藍本建造，負一樓室外陽光明媚☀️藍天白雲，處處濃郁着地中海浪漫風情🌴寶貝們在小草坪上奔跑追逐玩泡泡機，室外泳池裡玩劃小船，撈金魚，還有室內小型遊樂場，玩的不亦樂乎[強]🎈🐟
房間設施：入住1015房很好要比旁邊房間要大一些，看出去的視野也好很多，見視頻👇
服務：這裏給黃健經理點贊，一個非常好的人，在入住時遇到了些問題，讓我很不開心，黃健經理在第一時間盡力幫我爭取最好的解決方案幫我豪華房升級到行政房，讓我心情舒緩很多哈哈🌹
位置交通：離虹橋天地4公里不到.地鐵17號線諸光路下來1.3公里到酒店🏨
早餐：東西還算可以[強]
目前酒店正在搞二天連住優惠套餐，絕對性價比超值🏨

msg:先説優點，硬件設施是不錯的，地毯厚實，床也很軟，很乾凈，客房服務蠻好的，房間裝修高大上，包括一些五星級酒店該有的細節方面都很到位。
    缺點是除了客房，其他服務都差強人意，最不喜歡的是游泳池，入住的大多帶娃，節假日遊泳池會很熱鬧，但是明顯清潔消毒跟不上，上一個客人穿過的拖鞋洗都不洗直接扔櫃子裏，櫃子臭烘烘，沒有拖鞋，問裏面的阿姨，阿姨尖聲説哪有乾淨的拖鞋，讓我們拿一個塑料桶裏泡着的不知道啥情況的拖鞋，孩子要玩衹能忍着噁心穿了，有種澡堂子既視感。我們是陪孩子的，穿着自己衣服，進入泳池必須要經過一個消毒噴淋，昨天我們進的時候沒有開，今天進去的時候也沒開，到一半我給孩子倒個水，突然就噴水了差點淋了我一身，我讓服務員暫時關一下，或者其他通道可以走一下，有個男的在游泳池前台，一臉肯定的説，這個噴淋一直開着，衞生局要求開的，不能不開的，這肯定的眼神看着我，我反而像是個説謊的？説道理是説不清了，第一次在高級酒店碰到這樣的服務，有點懵。最終也沒有給解決，衹能自己想辦法，有點憋屈。既然是不能不開的，那昨天是不是違反衞生局要求了？我是不是可以舉報做個見證人。
   後來家人提醒反應過來，這個泳池可能是外包的，都沒有穿制服，但是我住的是酒店，好壞印象都是針對酒店的，即使外包也應該做好管理，畢竟壞的是酒店的名聲。
    吃的比較貴而且味道不行，看到很多住客叫外賣，我們今天最後一天也叫了外賣。
    所以這次的入住體驗總體來説比較差。不會再有下次了。現在是服務的時代，除了硬件，服務很重要，希望看到我評論的遊客，一定要住這個酒店的話，最好有個思想準備。

泳池還可以，小童樂園真的是小感覺有點上當了嚶嚶嚶。帶小孩的客人是多，早餐八點半下來的已經在排隊了，種類還算多，就是肉有點少。
其實現在很多二胎甚至三胎家庭了，但房間裏的設計衹考慮到單胎家庭，甚至我辦理入住的時候帶着兩個小朋友了到前台了也沒工作人員反應要給我多一件，如果能被注意到會更加開心的。

房間比宣傳要小，樓層過道一股劣質香水味，酒店得簽免責協議才給你開窗，所以不開窗就濃郁裝修氣味。
酒店推廣的室外泳池還不開放，所以壓根沒有其他的活動空間，入住就很無聊。
整體下來，幾乎沒有一點值得點讚的地方！

床：床太軟了，腰痠背痛，脖子也痛，因為沒睡好頭也疼，體驗太不好了。
味道：一進房間一股黴味，不知道是太潮還是怎麼回事，在房裡好悶人
外賣：外賣也不能送上樓，沒有智能機器人服務，不會再來了，睡不好的問題已經很讓人火大，外賣又不給送衹能自己下去拿，體驗感真很差。

    自駕過去，停車是免費的，出酒店前可以打電話到禮賓部報車牌號報備，這樣就免費了，但動作要快，和很多停車場一樣，給了15分鐘離場時間。

停車:比較方便，停車位還挺多

服務:服務水平參差不齊。辦理入住的時間是一個男服務生，提什麼要求都不肯答應，在知道我是大大皮的情況下，把我房間安排的離電梯很遠很遠，虧我還特地問他能不能安排個好一點的房間，他説所有房間都一樣！而且我訂的親子房，在check in的時候明明問了我帶娃是男孩還是女孩，我説是男孩，結果給我安排的親子房是粉色的女孩的親子房，非常不專業。在我的投訴下，立馬給我換了房間 離電梯最近的親子房。我真的無語。明明有合適的房間，為什麼不安排？真氣人。
接着去室外泳池玩，門口保安一定要讓我們走更衣室的通道進去。我大大皮，不下水，我跟保安説，讓我直接進去，更衣室要淋水我沒法進去。保安又問我，有沒有手環 我説沒，我們就拿了一個手環，前台就給我一個手環，保安反問我 你告訴前台你有幾個人了嗎？應該給你倆手環的，我説這是你們服務有問題，沒有給到一人一環，我説你明知道我大大皮不能下水為啥不肯給我走這個門？保安就説，那你去投投訴我呀！**！我真沒見到過這樣的服務！還五星級酒店類！太失望！一點ud不友好，來了就受氣！衹有前台Jessica可能服務態度好一點。

房間設施:再説房間 設施還可以，有的地方比較臟 空調我估計是幾百年沒清洗過了，我到了酒店就一直咳嗽，孩子睡覺睡到一半也覺得喉嚨難受！

然後我們這次也很倒黴，就玩了半天，半夜三點被前台叫醒，説有密接，結果被封控了兩天，設施都不能玩，而且多住的費用還要自己出600，搞得我們第二天出了核酸報告半夜兩點就離開了酒店。事後向酒店索賠酒店也是一分不賠的！
總體來説，都太差，不知道怎麼變成網紅的。服務真的不行。以後不會再去

服務：最好的服務，就是下車。幫你開車門，拿行李。真的感覺賓至如歸。前台公式化操作，最後開個發票，還搞得很複雜，從這櫃枱，到那櫃枱。最後給我張發票，不裝信封的。我也是第一次碰到。人家全季酒店都是轉好信封，雙手遞過來的。游泳池，好複雜。每次去填單拿房卡，沒有半點説明，直接給了我沒有箱子的手環，之後再出去和她説，小朋友獨自進男浴室，也需要箱子。你沒有箱子，東西，我們隨身攜帶，也無所謂，至少外面貨架上要有乾淨毛巾吧。反正細節上感受不到服務。隨便玩玩，沒有要求。

唯一優點，離虹橋天街近，吃東西方便。

最後，我週五入住，泡泡秀時間是15:00和17:00持續10分鐘左右。

服務：酒店是不錯，但是服務超級差，現在上海發佈都説了，住酒店衹需要48小時核酸報告，可到了酒店説必須24小時核酸，我們晚到的另幾個朋友，下午五點多到的，還要跑出去四處找地方做核酸，這算不算是層層加碼呢？
再説一下前台叫某二某的那位小姐姐，不知道有沒有受過培訓，還是那天心情不好，辦理入住態度惡劣，也不知道是不是因為學生都不建議離滬，生意好就牛了，無力吐槽啊！

設施：帶陽台浴缸，室內外泳池很棒
衞生：乾淨
環境：遠離城市，空氣清新

1、床上多處有頭髮，打電話讓給換了，差評
2、室外游泳池七點關了，讓工作日入住晚上想玩一玩變成不可能，差評
3、小童樂園幾乎啥都沒有，有個籃球機20元一次，咋不去搶呢，差評
4、帶着孩子路過瑜伽室，健身房，孩子想進去看一下，被趕出來了，説是十六歲以下不能入內，呵呵，還説有私教課，不能看。真見鬼了，差評
5、淋浴熱水無法調節，燙雞毛都沒這麼燙的，差評
6、外賣沒有機器人送餐，且快遞員不能入內放在前台，必須要等着，你們酒店真高級啊，差評，害得顧客每次都要下去拿。
7、前台那個***服務員，態度冷冰冰，差評
8、回想下寧波，蘇州很多偏僻的五星級酒店，都沒有這麼多屁事和垃圾要求

- 訂的親子房，實際跟其他房間一樣，衹不過放了個小童床，一個搖搖晃晃的帳篷，一個小童毯子（上面還有好幾塊污漬…）
- 所有親子房都是背對泳池的，視野極差，衹有一扇很小的門通陽台，沒有窗户。
- 所謂的陽台其實也是裝飾性的，連兩個人都站不下。 還很假的説為了安全把陽台鎖了，實際就算能出去也不能用。

室外泳池很臟，因為沒有遮擋所以超級曬，至少4-5點室外才會沒那麼曬，泡泡派對就是個噱頭，沙池玩的小朋友不多，因為太曬了！！室內泳池還可以，但躺椅之類的太少，沒地方放毛巾跟浴袍。
服務還有待提高，既然價格定位不低，至少服務也要對標吧？！普通的商務型親子酒店，不會再去的那種。

晚餐在中餐廳，是一位瘦瘦的滿精乾的男領班經理幫我們點菜，當時時間有點晚了小孩子餓了，他特意幫我們跟廚房要求準備了小孩子能吃的湯麪，還一再叮囑要先做給小朋友吃。非常非常感謝！
還有個小插曲，下午回到家，家人發現掛在衣櫥裏的衣服忘記拿了，本來也沒報太多希望，結果賈經理微信問候我們入住體驗的時候我就跟她提了一下，她特意幫我們找客房部門核實，然後半小時不到就幫我們快遞發出來了，真的非常非常感謝她！

房間設施:房間很大布局合理，有全景的陽台，舒適的大床，貴妃椅。最喜歡浴室，很有設計感，淋浴和浴缸分開，還有一面“魔鏡”。酒店設施:沙灘:不算小，沙子比較細。泳池:泳池有室內室外，還有汗蒸房，娃喜歡餐廳:味道還可以。健身房免費開放.服務:酒店賓客關係經理會提前聯繫客人詢問房間喜好，前台李二寧Anna熱情主動，送我們到房間，還免費升級了房間，感受到了優質的服務。餐廳吃飯還有優惠券哦，總之一次不錯的打卡。整體性價比挺高的。

衞生:酒店大堂及房間內部乾淨整潔，帶陽台和浴缸，床品柔軟，睡在上面也十分舒適。值得一提的是房間隔音效果很好，關上門窗後非常安靜。

設施:酒店共12層，一樓大堂的水晶燈和紅地毯豪華大氣，香氛味道也不錯。B1層有免費的健身房和游泳
池，場地都很大。spa按摩需付費使用，一樓大堂吧有甜品和咖啡茶水下午茶供應，還有中西餐廳環境都不錯。可以單點送到房間內用餐。去吃自助餐還可以到前台領取100的優惠券，很划算了。

服務:前台服務和禮賓部服務態度認真負責。疫情期間需要填寫入住表和來訪相關訊息，並進行人臉識別。對於安全管控和疫情防護的措施還是比較滿意的。
總體來説還是一次很滿意的入住體驗，尤其是賓客關係經理賈金彩專業又周到的服務，手寫的歡迎信很加分，老爸還發了朋友圈炫耀！提前準備好了發票。退房時候小賈還為我們準備好了獨立包裝的口罩，很為顧客考慮了。下次出差會繼續選擇這裏!

先是入住時幸運的碰到了Amy，她給我們四間房都排的很靠近，而且很親切的回答我們的問題，幫助我們登機停車訊息，並且我們定的迷你吧免費使用，用了之後她還幫我們很快速的讓客房部來補。入住房間有小賈很正能量的歡迎卡片，真的想要像她寫的那樣，保持熱情，堅持運動。
大堂的樓梯是真的很好出片，我們一家8個人，都打了卡，自助晚餐和早餐也是還不錯吧～想要夏天再去住，到時候就可以在室外泳池玩耍了。
退房時的Christina就一般般吧，很遺憾沒有再次遇到Amy小姐姐，退房有點匆忙，本來想給Amy寫一封感謝信的，感覺新年遇見她，也是一種幸運，祝福這個可愛的前台小姐姐。

msg:優點: 户外泳池，建築物朝向非常好，三點後户外泳池一半能在陰涼處，大床房睡一家三口不擠
缺點: 早餐是五星的收費三星的檔次， 推薦選不要早餐的房費，自己點外賣
