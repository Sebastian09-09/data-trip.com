msg:My experience at the COLI Hotel was truly exceptional. From the moment I arrived, the service was impeccable. The staff at the front desk, Manoj and Mika, as well as the Guest Service Center staff, were attentive and went above and beyond to ensure my stay was comfortable and enjoyable. The facilities were top-notch; the state-of-the-art fitness center was perfect. Every aspect of the hotel was designed with luxury and convenience in mind. As for the food, it was a culinary delight. The chefs clearly have a passion for their craft, presenting a menu that was both innovative and delicious. Each meal was an adventure in taste, with fresh ingredients and beautifully plated dishes. Overall, my stay was delightful in every way. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a high-quality travel experience in Shenzhen.
It's great to hear you had such a wonderful time!

Staff were always friendly and served with a smile. I will surely stay again. Room was clean, bed was super comfortable and I enjoyed the bathtub much. Love that their shower area, WC and bathtub are all clearly nicely separated too. Hygienic!

🪔From the moment you stepped into the hotel lobby, you were attracted by its elegant a**osphere, as if you had entered a magnificent palace. Exquisite and elegant, showing the aristocratic style. The crystal chandelier in the center of the lobby shines brightly, matching the surrounding murals.
 
🛏️The room is spacious and bright, and the layout is warm and comfortable. Every detail reveals the hotel's thoughtfulness, from the texture of the sheets to the quality of the toiletries, all showing five-star quality. In the early morning, a ray of sunlight shines on the bed through the curtains. It is warm and comfortable, and I don't want to get up for a long time.
 
🥣The hotel's breakfast and dinner are also full of surprises, and every dish is endlessly memorable. In addition to delicious food, the hotel also has rich entertainment facilities, where you can release stress and enjoy physical and mental pleasure.
 
💕The most praiseworthy thing is the hotel’s service. Every employee is kind and friendly, and their smiles and enthusiasm are as warm as the spring breeze. Whether they are receptionists in the front office, room service or restaurant waiters, they all demonstrate extremely high professionalism and humane care. They took the initiative to help us carry our luggage, answered questions patiently and meticulously, and took the initiative to care about the needs of the guests, making us feel at home.
 
🌟As the first stop in Shenzhen, staying at Shenzhen Zhonghai Kaili Hotel is really a very pleasant experience. I highly recommend it to guests in need! Come again next time!

The hotel lobby is grand, the rooms are large, and the hardware is good, but the hygiene is average. The carpet feels gray, as if it hasn't been cleaned for a long time. The attitude of the front desk was quite good, but the attitude of the room service was not good. I couldn't find a spare roll of paper. I called for help to bring a roll. The waiter was very impatient when he came in and said that the paper should be placed at xxx. It is also a star-rated hotel, but the management gap with international chain brands can be seen in the details.

msg:I was coming to Longgang to meet my girlfriend's family over the weekend, so I stayed at this hotel nearby. I've worked in hotels before, so I wanted to try out what an old five-star hotel would be like. The lobby was really grand and magnificent, and I was given a free upgrade. Room type, the room was very quiet and comfortable. I wanted to go for a swim, but I didn’t have the chance to use the swimming pool, so I turned around and went to the gym and pedaled. After exercising, I went back to wash up. I turned on the water in the bathtub and then went to the shower room to shower. This water pressure hurts my life! I've stayed in many hotels and was shocked for the first time by the water pressure here. It's really good. I like [strong][strong][strong] very much. I looked at the hardware and found that the hardware used was TOTO, an international brand. Even though the hotel has been open for many years, the hardware is indeed very bright, which shows that the room staff are very attentive. Went to a Chinese restaurant for dinner in the evening. There were not many people and it was very comfortable. The service was very good and they were very proactive in adding tea. I drank monk fruit tea while eating fried food, so it wouldn’t be too hot. The salt-baked chicken was pretty good, as the Cantonese people say “ It tastes like chicken, and the bones are very hard. This chicken is a bit old. The breakfast on the second day was rich and varied, combining Chinese and Western styles, but unfortunately the stomach capacity was limited. Overall this hotel can be recommended. PS: I tried the whiskey bar next door to the hotel and the cocktails were very good.

I found a nearby hotel that had Longgang consumption coupons that could be used to deduct it. It was a great deal [呲ya]. There was a welcoming lady in the lobby who greeted me warmly and with a smile. (Mainly because they reminded me to pay attention to safety when I left). After sleeping, I woke up and walked around the hotel. I really wanted to swim in the swimming pool, but it was raining. When I got back to the room, I felt that the weather had changed. I was late ordering takeout. I couldn't deliver it because the road was flooded, so I went downstairs to have dinner. Watching the news and the pedestrians rushing around, I ate my dinner so slowly. It felt so comfortable to let my whole body relax. It's so rare to feel like this, I thought. I will take a break from time to time

msg:I stayed at the hotel during the Spring Festival. It was quiet, clean, and the service was good. I even upgraded and gave welcome fruit. There are also peanuts, melon seeds, pistachios and red candy at the front desk; there is enough mineral water in the room. There is also a lion dance and a lucky draw on the first day of the ***** New Year. The gym is big and has a full range of equipment. There are Vanke Plaza, many snacks and supermarkets around. There is also Fresh Hema nearby.

I ordered takeaway, and the security guard at the gate (job number 28639) told me not to let me in, and then the robot was in the hotel lobby again. Is not this contradictory? And the attitude is very bad, moving a bench to block the entrance of the hotel.

Third, the service is better and parking spaces can be provided to solve the parking problem. But when we arrived, we found out that the hotel said that because of the concert, their parking space was full and there was no parking space, so we asked us to find a parking space by ourselves. Really speechless, we are already on the third day of the concert, didn't there be such a problem in the first two days? When we arrived, we were told that there was no parking space for us to find by ourselves, and it really was. . . There are still a lot of details that are not done very well, such as when you check in, you are notified of the location and time of breakfast, etc., but nothing, so-so. I shouldn't choose it next time

After consultation, you can go to the concierge depar**ent to register and then you can leave. The feeling here is super bad. There are 2 employees at the concierge depar**ent counter when queuing up for registration, and one is a male employee (I don’t know if it is The concierge manager or the director), a female employee was meeting the customer in front, and the male employee said: What's the matter? Me: I registered the vehicle and left, and then he walked to the side without saying a word, thinking that he was going to help me register, and when I approached, he said: She (the female employee next to me), is this the attitude of the concierge? If you are not a service customer, don't suddenly say: What's the matter? ! So stupid that he thought he was a resident, and instantly felt disgusted.

When I woke up at noon, my whole body smelled of smoke. service needs to be improved. There are a few female customer service staff with relatively high positions at the front desk whose professionalism needs to be strengthened. They have no expression or look at the customers during the whole process, and they have no enthusiasm at all. I can understand that there are many people, or you have a high position. But having too many people is part of the job. As a customer, I have to give you a smiling face, which is not good for my senses. Everything else is fine

At the entrance of the lobby, there were three large trolley suitcases, but no staff offered to bring a luggage trolley, and they pushed the luggage trolley to the room by themselves. The matching price is really unbelievable. The front desk was impatient, asking where to eat, looking for express delivery, and asking for a handbag was very complicated. And the handbag does not have a hard paper bag, only a soft bag is very inconvenient. The service and standard equipment are not in line with normal five-star hotels.

Hygiene: ordering in the room, the pan-fried fish fillet is not fresh.

I have to stay for a week, and I only booked two days to check out early, which is very poor.

Mineral water is all in small bottles. If you want more water, you will only be given two bottles. If you ask for more water, you will be charged. It is really weird. The house price of 1,000 yuan and the small bottle of mineral water of 1 yuan are charged separately. In Shenzhen, this kind of service feels like it is in a small county. The breakfast is not good, there are few varieties, and the service is average. Asked to cook a bowl of wide rice noodles, the operating waiter directly pointed to the cooked round noodles and let me take them. I don’t like to eat round noodles, and I only want wide noodles, so I re-cooked a bowl of wide noodles. Will not go to live again.

The key is that the service aspect is stuck! I stayed for two days and asked to send two more bottles of mineral water. The lady who answered the phone at the front desk said that there are only two bottles, and I can’t send more. The key is that I will stay for two days, at least four bottles should be given! It's also the first time I've seen you.
Ctrip originally said there was an exclusive gift for booking a room, but I didn't receive it.
The construction site next to it is also under construction. If it is not just close to the place of work, it is estimated that it will really not be able to live.

3. Furniture, lights are real. . It’s hard to say, I can’t operate anything at the same time as the master control, and the curtains are still stuck manually. I wonder if it’s inconvenient to not put garbage bags on the environmental protection trash can?
Summary: I estimate that the level is at most 2-3 stars. There is basically no service, but the price is also low. Maybe the price reduction = service reduction. There are no hotels nearby to choose from. Anyway, I won’t go there again. The experience is rated as 4 points (out of 10)

In addition to collecting money, the front desk has no polite language, no smile, and no service guidance. It will not tell you where to eat, whether you need to get a breakfast coupon or use the room card directly, and will not tell you where the elevator is. You need to ask yourself. There are no garbage bags in the three trash cans in the room. I don’t know why, there is no trash can in the bathroom, just put a compressed garbage bag on the toilet, and the guests can disassemble it and put it on the trash can if they want to use it. The room is small and the decoration is old. There is a construction site outside the hotel, which is noisy. The only advantage is that the power card will be plugged in in advance in the room. The others are like a comfortable hotel.

msg:在這家酒店參加了幾次年會和婚禮，雖然酒店時間久了點，但是還是沒想到會那麼差。首先，房間的隔音很差，門窗關緊馬路的行車聲還是很明顯，而且周邊都是工地，晚上施工到十一點還沒停工，早上七點半就繼續動工了，酒店很貼心的在床頭放了耳塞，如果對睡眠有要求的，還是不建議來。
第二，房間衞生真的不怎麼樣，設施也比較老舊。枕頭有異味，四個枕頭勉強挑了兩個相對好點的用。浴巾毛巾什麼的也是，廁所馬桶還會不停的有流水聲。
第三，早餐問了前台是到早上十點的，但是九點三十多分到餐廳，員工已經開始收拾了，麪食區也已經收完了。
雖然不打算再來這家酒店了，但是前台的服務態度還是不錯了。

早餐的感受很差，不知道是不是最近疫情原因，品種非常少，對不起這個價格，和五星級酒店應有的早餐規格不匹配，最搞笑的是，拿煎雞蛋的沒有配生抽，還要特意問服務員要，説我們這一直都這樣，客人吃煎雞蛋不用生抽。頭一次遇到！

It's okay to complain to them. Calling Ctrip's customer service to coordinate is not enough, and Ctrip finally subsidizes half of the cost.
