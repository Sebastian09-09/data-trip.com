msg:The hotel is located in the scenic area, next to the route to Qianshan. The price includes two tickets, sightseeing tickets and parking fees, which add up to more than 200 yuan. If you are traveling as a family, it is very cost-effective. The hotel room is very nice, the staff's service attitude is first-class, and the breakfast is also very good. ÔøºThe essence of Yunqiu Mountain Scenic Area is the ice cave with average mountain scenery. If you take the Qianshan summit route, you need to be reminded that the opening time of the ice cave is 10:00. It is best to leave the hotel after 9:00. The hotel has a sightseeing station. I climbed the front mountain, then descended from the Yuhuangding Cableway, and returned to the hotel at about 2:00. Most people will choose to walk up the back mountain and need to walk down the slope of the hotel to take a bus. In fact, it is also very challenging to climb from the back mountain to the top of the mountain and climb from the cableway station to the Jade Emperor Summit. If you are bringing the elderly or young children, be sure not to go to Yuhuangding. Just go around the front mountain and reach the ice cave.

msg:I understand that there are insects in the room on the grounds that the ecological environment is good. But around 9pm, I found bugs crawling on the bedside and caught them myself. But it was crawling high above their heads, scaring the family so much that they couldn't sleep. I went to customer service and waited for 20 minutes to catch the bugs. After struggling for 40 minutes to catch the bugs, the bugs were not completely caught. I applied for a room change, but the front desk said that the room was full. When I was helpless, I couldn't catch the bugs completely and got angry at the customer service. The front desk took the initiative to call and communicate about upgrading the room and guaranteed a bug-free room. I was asked to pack my things and wait for another room change. I waited for another half an hour and was notified at short notice that the room would not be upgraded. I then waited for the next room to be cleaned and bugs were caught. Later I found out that the customer service manager went back on his word after arranging the room upgrade and let the front desk take the blame. The manager had an indifferent attitude and was unwilling to communicate. Nor listen to any description of anything. As a fellow from the Northeast, I find this attitude quite embarrassing. You can't rest until after 11 o'clock. When a problem arises, such a leader does not want to solve the problem, but just wants to waste the customers. This is very disappointing. If you get angry in the middle of the night, please deal with it a little bit, otherwise it will be wasted.
If you don‚Äôt mind bugs crawling, you can come, otherwise I definitely don‚Äôt recommend it.
One thing is that the customer service attitude at the grassroots level is okay and very sincere. But I feel very pitiful when I can‚Äôt make the decision.

2. I couldn‚Äôt log in to the WiFi according to the prompt. I called the front desk three times but didn‚Äôt answer.
3. The air conditioner in the room was actually heating. The front desk said it was under unified control and could not change the mode. I asked what should I do if I was very hot and asked me to open the window. . There was nothing she could do. . . . Sure enough, I was woken up by the heat several times in the middle of the night.

It is very convenient to visit the scenic spot, and the Wulong Palace transportation station is right at the door.

msg:On the second day in Yunqiu Mountain, I checked into the Novotel Hotel. It is a newly opened hotel with young staff, full of enthusiasm and vitality! When we checked in at 12 noon, the restaurant only had simple meals. The little one was a little fussy, so the restaurant manager asked the chef to help prepare sliced, peeled and meridians-free oranges. This kind of thoughtfulness made the check-in experience satisfying. June, the duty manager, is sincere and gentle, and her smile is very lovable. When we encounter rainy days while traveling, help us prepare umbrellas and call electric cars. Be responsible and patient! It's just a newly opened hotel, and the front office has limited authority. I hope the upper management can decentralize some of it and really give young people a chance to exercise!

It is also very convenient to go to Kangjiaping to eat or travel. There are scenic buses at the door. It is recommended to focus on visiting the back mountain. From the mountain behind the hotel, go all the way to visit the ancient village of Tarpo in Shenxian Valley, the ice cave, and go to the glass bridge if you have the energy. If not, forget it. It is really not recommended to take your children to the front mountain to take the ropeway and then walk to the back mountain.

msg:A newly opened hotel in Yunqiu Mountain Scenic Area. Accor's brands are indeed trustworthy!

Facilities: Very new, the facilities inside the room are advanced, the power supply, lighting and TV are all automatically controlled, and there is no need to plug in a card to get power. Although the room is small in size, it is modern and conveniently decorated. The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom and shower facilities are of high quality.

Environment: The hotel is not big but very unique. The exterior design looks like an ancient castle, which probably draws on the stone architectural features of the ancient villages in Yunqiu Mountain.

Hygiene: It is a newly opened hotel and the rooms are very clean and tidy inside and outside.

Service: The staff at the front desk and concierge were very friendly and helpful when checking in. The response to phone inquiries before check-in was also very patient and thoughtful. Especially Li Kexuan, who was always enthusiastic and thoughtful for the guests during our stay, and helped us a lot. The duty manager on the day and June Yiyi and Lavonne at the front desk were also very helpful when checking out, and even helped us book a ride to the train station. In short, the hotel staff are well-trained, which is indeed the standard of brand hotels!

The only slight drawback is that we checked in on a weekday. Because there were not many guests, breakfast was not served as a buffet, but was delivered to each room. I feel that this increases the workload of the staff and is prone to errors: the fried eggs we ordered were missing at the beginning, but they were replenished after a while. Maybe the self-service experience will be better during holidays.

Staying at Novotel makes it more convenient to go to the ice caves and other attractions in the morning. I would recommend friends who come to Yunqiu Mountain to stay at Novotel for 1-2 nights.

I saw that there was a lobby bar next to me, so I went over to see what food was available. Three dedicated service staff told me in standard Mandarin that I was sorry for not having a meal.
Finally, we asked about instant noodles. When the service staff said that the instant noodles were sold out, we felt indescribable. Not to mention the room, do you think it deserves more than 600?

msg:It's right inside the Yunqiu Mountain Scenic Area. There is a bus going up the mountain in front of the hotel. It's very convenient. The hotel is newly opened and very clean. With children, the hotel front desk manager upgraded the room. The stay was very comfortable and the breakfast was very rich. The most important thing The best thing is that every staff member is very enthusiastic~ From the moment you enter the scenic spot, even the security guard is extremely enthusiastic~~~Hahaha, you really feel at home~

msg:The newly opened hotel on May 1st, personally feels that the price/performance ratio is very high!
The hotel is located in the front mountain of the scenic spot, and the shuttle bus stop is right outside. It is super convenient to go to the front mountain Shenxianyu (the main tourist route of Yunqiu Mountain is in the front mountain), the back mountain (Kangjiaping Ancient Village, Camping Farm, Children's Paradise), etc.!
I have been going to Yunqiu Mountain every summer for three consecutive years and have stayed in almost all the hotels in the scenic area. However, this year‚Äôs experience is the best. I can enjoy the leisure time in the mountains while experiencing the convenience of modern services. Highly recommended!
Facilities: The hotel has complete facilities, and everything is available in the room. I was surprised to find that there was a weight scale, which is a benefit during the fat loss period. Hahaha, it shows how considerate the hotel facilities are.
Service: Breakfast and all-day buffet are also great, with a complete range of ingredients, fresh ingredients, both Chinese and Western styles, and the taste is very delicious. Although there are many guests during the summer vacation, the service is very good!
I heard that there are entertainment venues for children to be opened, and I‚Äôm really looking forward to it ~ I will definitely go there againüòÑ

msg:The hotel is in a good location in the scenic area. The facilities in the room are very new because they have just opened. The service is also very good. The breakfast buffet is very rich. The only thing is that it is far away from the surrounding counties and it is very inconvenient to eat at ordinary times. The price of eating inside the hotel is relatively high. It is also necessary Additional service charge. Overall, it is worth staying here when traveling

The closed information was not prompted on Ctrip‚Äôs booking page. Dinner at the restaurant requires a long wait. The service and reception capabilities are not up to the standards of other Novotels, which is very disappointing.

But having to buy tickets for scenic spots while staying in a hotel is a bit forceful. Originally I was just passing through and staying for one night, but it turned out that I had to climb a mountain before leaving the next day. If I didn‚Äôt climb, it would be a waste of tickets... Hahaha

msg:First, the room is newly renovated and has a strong smell. It is not suitable for children and pregnant women. Second, the service is so bad. The front desk staff is so inefficient. They can't check in at two o'clock at noon. I checked in at around four o'clock. The receptionist and the security guard at the door were confused. In the end, they just came to me temporarily. ,Impressed. Third, the breakfast is average. The overall experience personally feels that it is not as comfortable as staying at Qilkang Resort, just talking about the service attitude.

The facilities and equipment are very good. The front desk service is in place. It feels very warm. The room is neat and clean. The breakfast is good. The buffet in the evening is also quite varied. Many, Western-style set meals at noon and midnight are also available.

msg:The hotel is very new, and the scenery outside is nice. However, the corridor is really too long. I feel like I have reached the end of the world. I came up to the hotel in time for filming after dinner. I saw that the stairwell nearest the emergency exit of the elevator was full of equipment. I asked the front desk. I looked up how to open the emergency exit closest to my residence. They said that in case of emergency, the staff would open it in the background. Well, I usually pay attention to the emergency exits when I stay in a hotel. The bathroom and shower doors in the room are a bit leaky, which is not something I'm used to, after all, I have children with me.

msg:I rarely comment, but this time I feel that it is rare for Shanxi to have such good attractions and hotels. I hope it will be better next time I go, so I would like to make two points! 1. Service: There is cigarette ash in the bathroom; it is recommended to add a small piece of soap, which can save you if the bath liquid is not replenished in time! The girl at the front desk was inexperienced and answered the call quickly, but half of the information she provided was wrong. When responding to problems, she neither apologized nor thanked her but told customers what to do! 2. Catering: I ordered two cups of coffee in the afternoon, but there were no corresponding take-out paper cups, only ordinary paper cups, and I had to walk carefully while carrying them; Dinner: Western food was not authentic, except for the rice, which was a bit inferior, but the Chinese food was pretty good and the price was good. Not expensive, the service is also very good, recommended!

msg:The experience was so bad. We booked 3 rooms and arrived at the hotel at 12 noon. The front desk said that the room would not be available until 2 o'clock. When we waited until 3 o'clock, the front desk said that only one room could be opened at first. This made people very angry. I sent a message to the front desk. There were only 3 rooms opened when the fire started, and we were not kept waiting. We made sure with the store 2 days in advance that we could see the green mountains. Before booking the room, we also confirmed with the lady at the front desk that we wanted to see the green mountains. As a result, we got 3 rooms. The windows are all made of stone walls. There is no way to communicate with the front desk. I am not even in the mood to take pictures. The smell of decoration in the room is so choking that my nose is stuffy and I can't open my eyes. Just after I checked in, the front desk sent me a The room card said that the house needed to repair the pipes and asked us to go to the third floor for a room. It was very speechless. The experience was not the same as that of Kangjiaping B&B. We need to be careful when checking in. The room is too choked!

msg:Kangjiaping didn't make an appoin**ent, so I stayed at this hotel and booked three rooms. The order included breakfast, but the hotel said it didn't include breakfast. Then Ctrip paid for the breakfast, and I was very satisfied with the speed of settlement. Because we brought two children, we paid for their breakfast when we checked in. The hotel called us at almost 12 o'clock in the evening to verify. We felt very uncomfortable. The breakfast was quite expensive, but there was nothing to eat. It was not worth it. Price. The hotel environment is pretty good.

The breakfast is rich and delicious, and the Chinese dinner is delicious and not expensive. The Yunqiu Mountain bus can stop in front of the hotel, making it easy to go up the mountain. The room was upgraded for free, and the room card can be taken away as a souvenir. The facilities are complete, clean and suitable for taking care of children. I will stay here again if I go to Yunqiu Mountain again.
