The middle-aged woman at the front desk had a terrible attitude and asked him to change rooms, saying that the hotel was full. How could such a remote hotel be full? I strongly do not recommend it! The worst hotel I have ever stayed in. The soundproofing effect is poor. It is specially designed to receive enterprises. Many people play mahjong all night. The cost performance is very low

In addition, a small suggestion: can the paper cups for tea and milk in the breakfast buffet be replaced with ceramic or glass cups? Paper cups are not environmentally friendly and also reduce the quality and experience.

The downside is that the bracket of the bathroom shower was broken and not repaired in time. In addition, it seems that there is no one on duty at the front desk at 11 or 12 o'clock in the middle of the night. I wanted to send a toothbrush but no one served it. This does not seem to match the grade of the hotel. In addition, the breakfast feels very average!

I was out of town again in the middle of the night. To be honest, I dare not open the door. , I kept knocking on the door for several minutes, and called the front desk. The front desk called the security guard to come to the door of my room and saw that it was a drunk person. It took half an hour to figure out that it was a resident of another room. After such a toss It took a long time to fall asleep again, and I didn't sleep well all night, which seriously affected my rest. Fortunately, we are a couple, and if it's a girl, I won't be scared to death. The room facilities are average, and the air conditioner makes a sound similar to ventilation from time to time. I don't understand what's going on. The sound is not small. The elevator is not the kind of card that swipes the card to go to a specific floor. Anyone can go to any floor. I feel that the security level is not good. It’s so high, the takeaway can be delivered directly to the door of the room. In fact, if there are robots in the lobby, you can use the robot to deliver more food. I thought it was a relatively high-end hotel in the local area, there are too many places to be improved
