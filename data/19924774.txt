Let's talk about the shortcomings. Can the front desk smile a little? He keeps a straight face the whole time and only looks at the computer when talking without looking at the customers. The first impression is not good. The front desk at check out was ok. The decoration is okay but a bit old and there is no USB charging port. The biggest problem is that it is still very hot in Zhengzhou in mid-October. The indoor temperature is 30 degrees and there is no air conditioning to cool the air. Should this be analyzed in detail? Is it not possible to provide air conditioning even if you wear short-sleeves on such a hot day? And the air conditioning is set to low. I was so sleepy that I couldn't sleep, let alone the high gear. I had to turn off the high gear. In addition, the lower floor of the hotel was a banquet hall. The wedding room next to ours was banging on the door at around six o'clock in the morning. All kinds of shouting continued until almost eleven o'clock. Can the wedding room be arranged in a room further away from the normal residents? I can't rest at all. Finally, the road is being built in front of the hotel, and there will be traffic jams in and out. It's not convenient now.

I called the front desk to complain and asked to turn on the air conditioning system. The reply said that the temperature had dropped at this time and it was very cool outside. Can't turn on the air conditioner. I said that I had opened the window, but the room was under positive pressure and the cool breeze from outside could not enter (I have been doing air conditioning for many years, so I still have basic knowledge). Without air conditioning, their hotel would not be worthy of this star rating. After complaining several times, they were told that the air conditioner was on. I reminded them that I understand air conditioning, so don't fool me. The room temperature has the final say. As a result, after multiple complaints, we finally brought a fan to the room at 11.30. I asked him to stand on the chair and feel the temperature of the air outlet with his hands, and then he didn't dare to turn on the air conditioner. He kept saying that the boss said it was already open, I was speechless! As a result, I basically spent the whole night tucking in the quilt and taking off the quilt, unable to sleep all night long.
2: The lighting control is also depressing, with only three modes, welcome, leisure and sleep. In addition to turning off the overhead spotlights in sleep mode (all the lights in the house are turned off, there is no night light, and the bathroom exhaust fan...), the overhead spotlights are very hot and they just keep shining. The waiter said that this is also the case no way.
3: I made an appoin**ent for invoicing that night, but when I checked out, I still had to check it at the front desk before entering the invoice information. I don’t know the purpose of this reservation!
Because I complained a lot, after checking out, a hotel manager called me and said that the air conditioning system was indeed not turned on last night. They were willing to let me stay for free and waive the room fee for last night. I think the hotel's attitude is sincere, but our Chinese hotels sometimes don't do a good job in details. I am not a person who eats and drinks, so I refused her coordination. Let me tell you the real situation of the hotel, and everyone should pay attention when staying in the hotel.

msg:How should I put it? In fact, the service of this hotel itself is quite good, the room hygiene is also very good, and it is quite high-end. However, for some reason, the room has a pungent burnt smell. The hotel staff said it is the smell of carpet cleaning. , In addition, the room was very stuffy, with temperatures in the teens and twenties outside and over 30 degrees inside the room. With the air conditioner turned on, there was no cold air at all. Even wearing short-sleeves in the room at noon was so hot that I was sweating. For the swimming pool and gym, you need to go down to the hotel lobby and go up from another elevator. The first time I went to the hotel, the staff did not inform me. After I went there, the staff at the swimming pool felt very cold and said that I needed a fitness card. I ran down to the hotel front desk to get my fitness card. The hotel’s breakfast was pretty good.

She was very patient and responsible. When the ticket was changed later, she was proactive. It was really heart-warming to contact and reassure customers. On the day of check-in, I was in a hurry. When I checked in, I was shocked. It turned out that the hotel upgraded me to a suite. The anxiety of rushing away was gone, and I was ready when I came back from the concert. Fruit relieves our roaring throat. It is very warm, comfortable and I like it very much.

Liu Qianru at the front desk took us to visit their hotel's private rooms. The service attitude was very good, because the food standard did not match, and He took us to visit the hotel's buffet, and introduced us to nearby restaurants that are better for entertaining guests. Although she didn't eat at the hotel and passed by the lobby, Liu Qianru still warmly greeted her. The service is very good. In addition, the hotel's breakfast is very rich, and the room is also very good. If you have any problems, you can contact the front desk to solve it. It’s really worry-free and convenient.

msg:Personally speaking, I have stayed in many hotels on business trips. The hardware of this hotel is just enough, but the core problem is that it is not worth the price. The specific features are as follows:
1. The room size is small, and it is still smaller than other hotels with the same price even after upgrading the room type
2. Mattresses and pillows do not meet the grade of this price
3. There is no bathtub in the room, which is rare in hotels of this price
4. TV software cannot watch movies (the hotel has not paid membership)
5. The gym is not open 24 hours
6. Breakfast is quite satisfactory
7. As a hotel that mainly focuses on high-end business travel, the room is actually unable to dry clothes
8. The road at the entrance of the hotel is undergoing major repairs, causing traffic jams
9. The shampoo and shower gel are very cheap
To sum up, the main problem of the hotel is that the price is abnormally high. If the room rate of this hotel is lowered by 100-150 yuan, it may be a reasonable price (from around 300 yuan). At the current price, I think this hotel should not be considered for travel needs of any purpose.

The next day, when the room is full, the room will be allocated proactively, saving guests from the trouble of changing hotels. Considering that it is not easy for parents and children to take exams, we delayed check-out until 6pm~ I have stayed at JW Marriott, Wanda Vista, Sheraton and Le Meridien in Zhengzhou, and I have never enjoyed such a generous room extension. Thank you🙏The room facilities are also good, comfortable and practical It's new and clean, but the sound insulation is poor. The swimming pool is the highlight. Unexpectedly, a four-star hotel is equipped with a swimming pool that is as good as a five-star hotel. The water quality, depth and lane isolation are all standard. Recommended. However, the supporting services at the swimming pool are unsatisfactory. The electronic locks of the towel lockers are not provided and the guests are dissatisfied. The waiter not only had a black face throughout the entire process without any polite words, but in the end actually cursed the guest as sick, which set a new low in my understanding of hotel employees 😄 It is said that the swimming pool is outsourced, so I understand. One point for the service is deducted here, it really hinders the high-quality service at the front desk

msg:我們三位一共預訂了三間房，一間大床房，兩間標準間（含早餐）入住。
1.服務很不專業，欺客！前台美女打電話問了是否續住，我們告知續住，並且讓我們先續訂標準間，我們也下單了，最後酒店還是把大床房定出去了，若再入住就衹能讓我們大床房房間更換其他標準間房型，嘴上説著不好意思，但是就是行欺客之實。
2.衞生很一般，淋浴噴頭堵塞，都長久沒更換失修。
3.酒店隔音非常差，隔壁説話的聲音傳過來，好像就和你在同一間房間，非常不私密，不建議情侶、商務入住！
4.酒店早餐也很一般。
5.一次性個人清潔用品很low，感覺像快捷酒店。
是否真實，請大家可以試一下。
