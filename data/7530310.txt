There are many things to do in and around the hotel - the hotel is built around a mall with lots of stores and restaurants, and is situated in an area central to most of the must-see things in Guangzhou. The Canton Tower is only a few minutes drive from the hotel. The staff are extremely friendly and make sure that all your needs are seen to. The pool and jacuzzi was so relaxing! Will definitely visit again. Thank you for making our stay a memorable one!

I was more interested in staying after visiting Rosewood and and learning that Conrad Guangzhou was named Luxury hotel of the year for China South by,   That’s. The hotel staff was very kind and accommodating. They helped me take some pictures around the hotel! Sherlock is very good taking pictures! The panoramic river side room I booked was gorgeous! I really love the bath tub in front of the window with the gorgeous view. The luxury toilet is amazing. The room felt big and cozy. I took some pictures at the pool, however, the pool wasn’t as beautiful as advertised because the long floating object was there so it didn’t look as beautiful as I thought it would be. The lifeguard was kind and helped me take pictures. I enjoyed the breakfast the next day. I didn’t enjoy the breakfast as much as I thought I would but it was still okay. My stay was very good overall! Also, Cynthia gave me a beautiful tour of the hotel when I arrived!

msg:This is an ok hotel. Staff is kind and relatively English-friendly, but there is a wait for everything. The hotel layout is confusing-it is hard to find restrooms in public places, and there are 2 sets of elevators-one that will take you to a room and one that will not. Food is excellent, and is a highlight. 

Rooms are decent, but a little confusing and fancy. There are multiple sets of lights, for example, and it is hard to determine where to turn the lights on for different things. The toilet is automatic and is a little loud and creepy. While the room was clean-there were many signs of poor construction and wear and tear-stains on the washroom floor, cracks in a sink. I had to fill the bathtub up with the shower nozzle because the faucet for the tub was too far away from the wall and made the floor, not the tub, wet. I could not get the light on the table to turn on.

I wouldn't say this is a bad place, but for the high price I expect far, far better.

There are all kinds of food in the surrounding business district. The hotel room facilities are very smart, the internal configuration is reasonable and comfortable, the service is responsive, and the double bed room is very suitable for bringing children.

The view of the room is very very beautiful, with views of the Guangzhou Tower, the Pearl River, and the city. It is the best tourist hotel for people who have just come to Guangzhou. The hotel is next to the shopping mall, which is very convenient. There is a food street opposite the hotel. The restaurant bar is very lively. The hotel fitness pool is also very good. The hotel provides free drinks and snacks. It is very warm. The hotel service is also great. The service staff will take the initiative to greet. I will definitely recommend it to my friends next time.

Two things that were disappointing were
The discount rate at the Chinese restaurant is very disappointing.
When I inquired in the room, I was told there would be a discount of up to 25%.
When I actually visited, I was very embarrassed to be told that there was no discount after eating.
And it is very unfortunate that the staff in the Chinese restaurant do not speak English.

The full floor-to-ceiling windows have a first-class view of Guangzhou Tower, but Conrad Hotel is an old five-star chain hotel after all, and the interior settings of the room pay more attention to details! The bathroom settings are more reasonable and comfortable! Even the bathrobe is more comfortable! Needless to say, the surrounding business district, museum, food street, subway station are all available! It is very comfortable and satisfying to stay with children in a double bed 👍🏻

msg:I don’t play Hilton very much, and I am a regular silver member, but there are welcome fruits + small gifts for check-in + free mini bar😘 As the top brand of H family, Conrad’s price is definitely not affordable. The panoramic room of 26XX for one night can be a bit expensive, but After experiencing it, I still have to admire the ability of "money"💴. The power of money has brought about a 200% value-for-money experience😍😏

The staff are courteous, and the scenery and transportation location are absolutely superb. Below are Tianhui, Tiande, and Liede, which are the heart of Guangzhou. The room facilities are also very new, and the decoration is mainly wood. However, the only small regret is that I, who live on takeout, need to go out manually to get the takeout. There is no robot to deliver it, and there is no smart takeout cabinet outside. It is just placed on an ordinary shelf.

H's bedding is considered to be the best among Kaiji and Wanji. It is not too soft (to criticize a certain M by name). The pillows are very suitable for me and I sleep very comfortably. 2am. I sleep the next day at 9am. Very comfortable. But the gym is a bit small, and the equipment is relatively old. The aerobic area has good equipment, but the equipment is relatively old, almost the same style I used 10 years ago.

I really like the eco-friendly bag I received. The colors and patterns are very nice, haha. Byredo sells all the toiletries, and my cousin said her toothbrushes are also good, but I’m still used to bringing my own. I hope I can stay here next time if I have the chance (and the money). Well being!

To go to Guangzhou Taco, you can walk, take a taxi or take the subway. It's a bit far, so if you like to stroll around slowly, you can stroll around until you reach your waist. We have to cross the Haixin Bridge. Then I took a tram to enjoy the most beautiful 7 kilometers. I felt it was not as good as the blogger recommended. You can take it if you are not in a hurry. For 6.9 yuan, you can ride unlimited times a day.

msg:This should be the dozens of times I have stayed at Conrad. I choose it here every time I go on a business trip, and even the company's regional meeting is held here, because it carries a lot of touching things. I like it from the details of the service to the location to the cleanliness. But I will not choose it again in the future.

There is only one reason: the pursuit of turnover rate and communication during peak hours makes people uncomfortable. When I moved in, I was asked to upgrade from the beggar room to a suite for 800 yuan, and I agreed without saying anything. The suite benefits shown to me include check-out at 14:00 (peak hours are explained separately). I specifically asked if it was the Canton Fair, and I was told that it was not open yet. I said that I might drink in the evening and I would try to leave early the next day.

I got drunk after socializing in the evening. At 11 o'clock, the aunt yelled and asked if I wanted to wash clothes on time. At 12:01, she called me on time to ask me to check out. These are nothing. I said that I must come down before 13 o'clock when I just got up (I don't think I am unreasonable), and then told me that I must come down within 30 minutes. Maybe few people ask me so strongly. I replied impolitely, "Then you can help me collect my luggage, and hang up."

I'm sorry for being rude to my boss, but how much can this 30 minutes really delay the hotel's business? Even if it's true that these 30 minutes will delay your next big customer, you can soften your tone a little. I expect the hotel to communicate with me first, pay attention to the collection of details, and if it doesn't work, explain the reason and ask me to think about it. I can do everything from payment to thinking about it, but it's definitely not thinking about being scolded by you.

The next day, I found the newly opened Indigo through Ctrip customer service, and I also experienced their service. I sincerely say that if I continue like this, I will be killed by the new hotel.

Put a full stop to the past youth.

Although I can't accept the design of the room (I always can't find the door and run to the toilet), the beautiful view, location and cost-effectiveness really make me love it.
The sales will call one day in advance to ask if there are any preferences, and then add WeChat, and they will respond to any requests during the stay.
I have a hobby of collecting Conrad Bears, Guangzhou Direct Delivery Diamond Card and Suite, but the sales still helped me apply for one, the new cherry blossom pink is really beautiful.
The toiletries are as always from White Rhett, in large bottles, very environmentally friendly, I like it very much.

The room is spacious and clean, with double basins, separate shower room, separate toilet, mirror TV, and smart toilet. I like the double double bed room very much. Each of the 1.5 beds can bring a child to sleep, so comfortable!
The smiling service and warm welcome from the hotel's front desk and concierge give people a very good feeling!

It was mainly for the whole family to come for a leisure trip. I handled it from the hotel lobby, room environment and facilities, and room service requirements. I am quite satisfied with everything.

msg:During the Spring Festival holiday this year, I chose to vacation in Guangdong. After careful selection and considering various factors such as location, hotel rooms, hotel services, etc., I finally chose to stay at the Conrad Guangzhou! All hotel facilities and services exceeded expectations!
Check-in: We arrived on February 10th, the first day of the ***** New Year. We were lucky enough to encounter the hotel's lion dance as soon as we got off the bus, which made us feel a strong festive atmosphere. The check-in staff were very nice and helpful. We arranged a high-rise, non-smoking room with a stunning river view!
Room: As soon as you enter the room, your eyes light up. The "small waist" is right in front of you. The room is fully equipped and large enough. The main design is the double bed, which is especially suitable for a family of three. The bathrobe, pillows, and towels are all very soft and comfortable.
Swimming pool: Because we had no schedule on the afternoon of the 10th, we went to the hotel's swimming pool. The water in the swimming pool was clear. At around 3 p.m., there were only three of us in the swimming pool. We swam very happily. The swimming pool also has an outdoor massage pool. Looking at the blue sky and white clouds is really pleasant!
Service: From the moment I checked in, every service staff I met took the initiative to say hello and provided cordial and enthusiastic service. I really felt "at home"!

The location of the Conrad Hotel is very, very good, next to Hunter Street and across the road is the Pearl River Trail. I have everything to eat, play and exercise. But what is more worth mentioning is that the service at Conrad Hotel is really very good. Any needs are answered immediately and provided to the best of their ability. There was always someone to answer the phone, and the doormen and front desk were very, very attentive. Just because of its good service and nice rooms, we stayed there for 8 consecutive days. Oh, and also want to mention that their Chinese restaurant food is outstanding. I will definitely stay at Conrad when I come to Guangzhou in the future.

msg:The hotel's location is good. It's next to a shopping mall and it's more convenient to eat. But the management and check-in time control are definitely not good. We checked in at 12:30 that day and were told that the room hadn't been cleaned yet, so we went to the hotel on the 13th. I went to visit the museum and arrived at the hotel again at 4:45 pm. The front desk staff told me that the room had not been cleaned yet and I had to wait for half an hour. The reason was that the previous tenant checked out late, so I was asked to check in here. As time goes by, such an argument is too far-fetched and speechless. What does the last tenant have to do with me? Checked out at two o'clock and it hasn't been cleaned for three hours? The front desk asked me to continue waiting, and we had to continue waiting in the lobby. They did not owe anything or arrange for us to sit for a while. This kind of management really made me dissatisfied. After half an hour, I checked into the room. On the left side of the door, there is the bathroom and the bed. The time in the header is so far different from the actual time, why don't you adjust it? Breakfast was mediocre. It wasn't even 10:30 yet, and the milk was gone, and there was no refill. In general, I have stayed in many hotels, and I have never encountered anyone with worse service attitude and management than them. I just pulled it. Damn, I will never stay at the Conrad Hotel again.

The guest room is fully enclosed, has no windows that can be opened, and has a very uncomfortable decoration smell.
The hardware facilities are very average, the decoration is rough, and the water in the sink is not flowing smoothly. The bed also collapsed in the middle.
The breakfast was just average. There were other things on the bread slices. The housekeeper didn't explain it to me. There was nothing special about the meal.
Checking into the hotel takes a long time, is inefficient, and there is no one to help with luggage.
I don’t want to say too much, I just want to tell everyone to avoid this pitfall and never stay at Conrad. I also hope that the hotel can pay attention to it and improve it.

At two o'clock in the morning on the day of check-in, the car was too low to go down to the basement. I talked to the security guard for a long time but he still wouldn't let me park on the first floor (there was already a car parked at the door). Then he told me that there was an event tomorrow and I was not allowed to park and those parked now would be asked to move away. I thought at the time that I didn't want to embarrass the workers, so I parked my car on the side of the road. The funny thing is that when I checked out today, I saw that the Macan I parked yesterday was still parked on the first floor parking space, and the car I parked on the side of the road because I didn't want to embarrass the security guard had an extra scratch.

There was no soap in the wash basin in the toilet, and there was only one piece of soap in the two wash basins outside. There was no soap in the bathtub. Are they all stuck like this now? In addition, I also booked a city view room, which was also the same situation and only gave me a piece of soap. The breakfast was okay, with relatively few varieties, but it was quite satisfactory and the taste was acceptable.

msg:I originally wanted to book a hotel in Guangzhou at will, after all, I mainly went to Chimelong. But after struggling for a long time, I decided to stay at the riverside on the first day because I could see my slim waist directly. After several days of screening, Conrad was finally chosen. The hotel contacted me the day before the trip to check the relevant information and added WeChat. Answer all questions, very enthusiastic. The next day I left Baiyun Airport but didn’t buy an airport bus ticket. I squeezed into the subway and transferred twice. I was a little unhappy at first, but I immediately felt happy when I stepped into the lobby of Conrad. Every aspect of the reception was cordial and courteous. The child is very happy. The room has a great view of the river. She also likes the facilities and space. The hotel is right next to IGC, as well as Tiande Plaza and so on. The distance to the riverside is estimated to be no more than 100 meters with the naked eye. There are many delicious restaurants around. When checking out, the little guy kept asking if he could renew. If you travel enough, you can stay a few more days.
In addition, Ally from the Guest Relations Depar**ent’s advance arrival arrangements and Flora’s return visit service were nominated and commended.

Before going there, I read reviews that said the service was average, but I really felt it after arriving at the hotel. We, two mothers with two children and two suitcases, entered the lobby and there was no service staff to help us with our luggage. After checking in, no one took care of us, which was a bit disappointing.
It costs money to upgrade the room type. I spent an extra 200 yuan to upgrade to a room with a view of Canton Tower.
environment:
The room environment is quite good and very large. The most important thing is the double sinks, which is very convenient for taking two children to wash up. As soon as you enter the door, you will find a separate bathroom with complete separation of dry and wet areas!
The Canton Tower seen from the room is very beautiful, even more beautiful with lights at night

Although the room I was given was too big and expensive, I could only see the expected value from a distance while bathing in the bathtub. It's heavily discounted and a five-star hotel doesn't even have disposable bath covers. Are you sure your bathtub is clean? When I called for consultation, they confidently said that we had definitely cleaned it. Many bacteria cannot be removed by simply scrubbing. I hope this can be improved.

msg:I booked a river view room. I didn’t pay attention to the river view double bed room I booked. It’s double... Do you have twin beds? We need a big bed and there is a price difference! It’s not expensive at more than 100, but it’s very annoying😫
After checking in, we brought two large suitcases and a stroller with us, but no concierge took the initiative to help us take them upstairs. I had to ask for them myself. What a shame! Enter the house and sit down. The price is 200 yuan cheaper. I ordered it for more than 1,900 yuan, but in five minutes it was more than 1,700 yuan. The price reduction is faster than flipping through a book! It was extremely slow to deliver something to the guest room. It was not the Mid-Autumn Festival. We ordered takeout 2 days in advance and it was not delivered upstairs. There was no big mirror in the whole room and there was a small one in the closet... I repeatedly stressed that there was no need to clean the room, but it was cleaned anyway. Really impressed! ! Hair in the bath towel is so disgusting! ! The hair dryer is particularly uncomfortable to use!
ps: I moved to Jumeirah after staying for two days. I called to say hello at noon. When I got to the room, there were children's slippers, bathrobes, etc. Takeaways were delivered super fast. Regardless of hardware and service, Conrad is far better than Jumeirah!
By the way, when we checked out at 2 o'clock, Conrad called and said, please come down and check out as soon as possible. Jumeirah said: If you don't need to extend your stay, is there anything I can do for you? They sent a staff member to help pick up the boxes. Overall, Conrad His morality is not even the slightest bit worse.

I feel this is a personal insult to me! For a hotel of this level to threaten residents for five-star reviews, it is disrespectful to the guests.

After the manager called for the first time, he asked the reason and said wait. After returning to the hotel, I contacted them to resolve the matter. However, I checked out and there was no call...

msg:Last year's New Year's Eve party was held at Mandarin Oriental, so I wanted to change the environment for this year's party. I came to Conrad to book a business sea view suite. Personally, I always prefer Conrad's decoration style. I have experienced Conrad in Shenzhen or Shanghai. Virtue is also good, and the price of wool is less than 3,000 yuan, which is also a good deal. The overall feeling: 1. The service and management can’t keep up. 2. The River View Hotel located in the CBD doesn’t have the advantage of the view of the hotel next door. There is no advantage either!
The problem is that during the preparation stage in the afternoon, I asked the staff three times for red wine glasses. They said they didn’t have any and found them again (provided that I clearly stated that I need 10-15 red wine glasses before booking the room. If I don’t have them, I’ll be there Nearby, you can bring wine glasses from home to the hotel, they first promised me that there is no problem)! The point is that a birthday party has a mandatory deduction of 1,000 yuan for stains less than the size of three one-yuan coins. After three days of communication, there was no word of agreement. At the beginning, I said that I could invite it myself. Auntie, the aunt I hired came to the hotel and he told me that I can’t hire them by myself. They have to be forced to cooperate with the cleaning company. I want to know if I have to pay the cleaning company if the cleaning company they force doesn’t clean it in the past. What about deducting my hotel deposit? ! This problem has not been solved until now. I make a phone call every day to say that the deposit needs to be deducted and the communication needs to be resolved. There is no complete management system.

msg:High-quality reviews Comparing several hotels with Guangzhou Tower view rooms, I personally think that Conrad’s full river view rooms are the most cost-effective. Although they are not directly facing the Canton Tower, it does not affect the viewing effect. The location of the hotel is very good, near Liede subway station, convenient for travel; near Tiande Square and IFC, convenient for eating; near Liede Bridge and Linjiang belt park, it is also convenient to see the river view at night. The highest room type with river view in the hotel is on the 23rd floor (the hotel's highest executive lounge is on the 27th floor). It is recommended to ask for a higher floor when checking in. The hotel's smart facilities are okay, but there is no hand sanitizer, only soap, which is not very convenient.

The room is large, with reasonable functional partition design, and the river view is invincible. The bedding is clean and comfortable, the swimming pool environment is good, and there is nothing wrong with the restaurant except Xiaogui.
The overall service attitude is acceptable, but I feel that as a five-star hotel, there is still room for improvement. For example, the front desk can be more enthusiastic, and a sunny smile is more suitable than a high-cold wind. In addition, guests should actively remind guests of the serving time of breakfast when checking in. We didn't go too late the next morning (compared to other hotels), but the breakfast room was already starting to wind down.

When I checked in, the girl at the front desk saw that we had upgraded two double-bed rooms with our children. It was very good. grateful. I complain about the layout of the room. When you enter the door, you should first look at the bathroom and the big bathtub. The so-called scenery means that you can’t see the scenery. One of the two windows is blocked by tall buildings, and the other side has no view. I didn't experience any service at all, but the two brothers who checked in and checked out the luggage twice were very thoughtful and patient. All in all, this was a very bad check-in experience. I originally wanted to stay in Guangzhou for a few more days, and I met some people and things in five cities in Guangdong for more than ten days. I didn't have a good impression. I only stayed for one night. Leave Guangdong and come to Jiangxi. The hotel didn't take any photos, only a few small waists.

Where does the charging standard come from? Where is the invoice? Which company did the cleaning? There are a lot of tricks. The waiter can directly mop away the things and charge me a high cleaning fee! I advise everyone not to stay here. The deposit of 4,000 yuan is directly cut in half. It is equivalent to me staying in a room type of 5,000. There is no business and they just play tricks. I have told you clearly. I have reported it to 12345. This rubbish hotel should be closed down as soon as possible. I stayed in 4 Seasons before and there was no such cleaning fee. Or your hotel thinks it is better than Four Seasons.

The voices of the little brother and the young lady at the front desk are very nice. We asked some questions and answered them patiently and meticulously. We also tried our best to meet the additional requirements. The attitude and scale of the service are just right, not too attentive, let alone It makes you feel cold and very comfortable🌸
I live on the 27th floor, the highest floor. There are two rooms next to each other. The doors of the rooms are opened facing each other. There is a small hallway in the middle. If the door of the hallway is closed, the two rooms can be turned into suites. A family of two generations can request to live in it. Opposite the door, very convenient.
There is no need to plug in the card to get electricity in the room. The curtains and washroom are smart homes. The room light has three modes, and there is also a separate reading light at the bedside. Both sets of bathrobes are very comfortable. Both my best friend and I like the fleece bathrobe. It is very comfortable. When we checked out, we were still discussing whether we should pay to take it home. There are also many places to sit. Friends in the next room There is no place to sit when you come to visit and chat, and there are plenty of places where you can spread your things. Hhhh, most of the sockets are equipped with USB sockets, and the various electronic devices that come with them will basically not fight. There are also shoe dryers and ironing machines, in case you forget to bring the data cable, there is even a mobile phone charging cable in the cable box. The design of the details of the room is very careful.
To use the swimming pool, you need to make an appoin**ent in advance. The hotel will control the number of users. In the locker room, there is a separate changing room for customers who value privacy. There is also a swimsuit drying bucket. Swimming enthusiasts really don’t have these supporting services. Resistance, love it 🧡💛
When we left the room to go swimming, it was around 9:35 in the morning. We happened to be checking out at the opposite door. A little brother came to clean up. We came back from swimming and washed things until after 12 o'clock. Just finished cleaning, it took more than two hours to clean the room, this is really a super comfortable stay, like it 👍🏻
If you don't want to go down for breakfast, you can call and have it delivered to your room. Variety and taste are good. The restaurant service is also very comfortable, very discerning, and the plate is collected in a timely manner, not talking much, and not overly attentive. As long as you say what you want to drink for coffee, the waiter will deliver it to your location. The fruits are delicious and of good quality. There are many varieties of freshly squeezed vegetable juices, all of which are original, even celery juice is very refreshing. There are still relatively few steamed and fried dishes. If you want to have Cantonese morning tea in the buffet breakfast in the room, you should give it up. The noodles and noodles are delicious, and there are more toppings and seasonings to choose from. The pork offal soup is very fresh. I like to eat raw omelettes. On the 8th, the omelette little master cooked the eggs with the best cooking in all the hotels I have stayed in. There are not many types of bread to choose from, but there are many types of dim sum, and the croissants are all very delicious. This is the first time I have come across honey with honeycomb. It tastes good when chewed. It is beeswax, not a messy product. The overall feeling of breakfast is very good, a book is satisfying🌸

The location is good, the floor is not high, and the view is average. The room design is very good and reasonable, and it looks very spacious. The service is a bit of a problem, there is a coffee machine but no capsules are replenished the next day after drinking it on the first day. In addition, the mini bar is free, and there is no reminder at the front desk. I don’t know if the reminder card on the table is intentional or otherwise.

2. The reservation was marked with free breakfast, but after the reservation, there was no p. In the end, Ctrip gave me a breakfast.

I specially booked a tower view room, but the weather was bad for two days. Although the tower could not be seen clearly during the day, the night sky was not bad. The hotel breakfast is very good, very rich and has Guangzhou characteristics. The rooms are relatively spacious, the facilities are relatively new, and some are very smart. The swimming pool facilities are very good, but the changing room is relatively small, and you need to make an appoin**ent in advance to go.
It may be because it is not a parent-child hotel, so children's products are not complete. There are no bathrobes, children's slippers, etc. Others are very satisfied!

Second, the service is considerate, printing is convenient, the waiter helps to open the door, and the service response is relatively fast.

There are all kinds of food and drink, and the first floor of the shopping mall is the subway Liede Station, which is very convenient. The facilities in the room are relatively new. I have lived in Marriott, W, Sheraton and Shangri-La, and they all feel similar. Our 2 adults and 2 children arrived at the hotel at 4:00 p.m. Some of the rooms were not cleaned up. We booked an executive river view double bed room (you can see the Canton Tower. After staying for two nights, the children liked it very much and were reluctant to leave. .

Whether the procurement depar**ent will do more, faster, better and more economical assessment tasks, the house price of 4,000 is worth the Canton Tower opposite (Figure 1). The service personnel still need to ask for it. This is a compliment. The surrounding Guangzhou Library, Guangdong Museum, parks, regular Cantonese restaurants in Guangzhou, Diandude, and Qiaomei are all within 500 meters, and they can be reached on foot, which is very convenient. For the tower view, you must live in a river view room or a better room.

The two 1.5-meter beds are so comfortable to sleep with the baby. There is a couch more than two meters long by the floor-to-ceiling windows, and you can lie on it and watch the Guangzhou Tower and the Pearl River. The bathroom in the room is very large, with double basins and a mirror TV. The toilet room lives alone in a corner, equipped with a Toto fully automatic toilet and a washbasin. The shower is huge and would have been better with more water pressure. For breakfast in the executive lounge, you can order Eggs Benedict and other wanton noodles and toasts. The afternoon tea is also richer than the Marriott series, and the key snacks are all delicious. There are too many delicacies in Guangzhou, so we tried HH at night. There are five or six kinds of hot food, as well as some fried food and cold food and soup. The buffet breakfast on the second floor has many varieties, and there are freshly steamed dim sum (shrimp dumplings, siu mai, etc.) delivered to the table. The breakfast on weekends is provided until 11:00, which is very user-friendly. The swimming pool looks good, but we didn't go into the water because of the cold. The children had a great time in the outdoor massage pool. In the evening, the three of us reserved it. The location is good, the first floor is seamlessly connected to the igc square, there is an ole supermarket inside, and there are many restaurants. There are two food streets within walking distance, within one kilometer walk from the Guangdong Provincial Museum, and you need to make an appoin**ent in advance through the small program. Although it is a business hotel, but seeing that there are quite a lot of families with children, it would be even better to add some children's play facilities appropriately! All in all a pleasant stay.

The temperature of the swimming pool is 28°C, which is enough for children to play. There are two bubble pools outside, and the water temperature is about 30 degrees, which is very good. The service staff from the front desk, breakfast to the swimming pool are polite and warm. Although the service staff knocked on the wrong door in the middle of the night and woke up the family, personal mistakes are inevitable. The little ducks in the hotel room, the children like it very much, you can take it home when you ask. When I received a return call yesterday, I was driving, so I didn't make any suggestions. Here is something for the hotel's reference. 1. The breakfast area is western-style, and there are few Cantonese-style morning tea. Tourists can't feel too much local flavor, and the northern food is basically missing. From my personal observation, the vast majority of tourists still prefer Chinese food. 2. There are a lot of tourists who bring their children to play. See if it is possible to open up a small world like a children's playground, which can add points to the hotel. Of course, the local area is very expensive, and it is estimated that such a space is not easy to manage. It is for reference only. On the whole, it is still a very satisfying and happy journey, thanks to the hotel staff.

After check-out, Ms. Flora from the Guest Relations Depar**ent paid a warm return visit and recorded detailed needs for the next stay.
There are many varieties of breakfast, and the soup with dog berries and pigs is full and delicious. (This is more in line with the characteristics of Guangzhou cuisine).
You can make an appoin**ent with three or two good friends, have a drink, eat, and chat in the room, and it feels very good.

Flora helped me register as a Hilton member, and warmly introduced the member-related benefits and policies. When I checked out, Kiki, who was in guest relations, was concerned about whether I was happy with my stay. Grace, the duty manager, also helped to coordinate and solve some problems.

At that time, I felt that the hotel's wifi was a bit slow. After the customer service learned about it, I followed up in time~
Daniel and Ally who checked in specially picked a room for us~ They were attentive to the smallest details~ Flora and Ally's online services were also very considerate~ full of warmth

My favorite is their swimming pool and bubble pool~ the water temperature is very comfortable! ! !
The gym is open 24 hours~the equipment is quite complete, and water and towels are provided at each place~it's good

It is a pity that the executive lounge on the 27th floor is closed during the epidemic ~ the food selection is relatively limited, and the beautiful scenery cannot be seen ~

Overall, it is still very good~ I look forward to coming again next time😍😍😍

This time, the things in the room had been opened... From the front desk to the check-out, it was all rotten. 1. It took more than ten minutes to check in. When the car arrived, no one came to pick it up. Only the security guard came and the luggage was unable to find anyone. 2. I couldn't get into the parking lot, so I went around a few times in the middle of the night to go to the parking space. The next day the hotel woke up several times by calling to move the car. 3. The front desk service awareness is very poor, and the apology is not brought from beginning to end for causing trouble. 4. The disposable items in the room have been used, and no one has been seen for 40 to 50 minutes after calling for water delivery. Very speechless.

This room type is a corner room with a 180-degree panoramic floor-to-ceiling window, which is very good. Sanitation, facilities are quite satisfactory. The only downside is the arrangement of running water in the minibar, which is a bit inconsistent with the location of the hotel.
Swimming pool: OK, a little crowded on weekends.
Executive Lounge: Afternoon tea and happy hour are all in the form of self-service, and the variety is a bit too small.

The whole hotel is decorated in new Chinese style, simple and a**ospheric. The bedding is good and the layout of the room is very reasonable. It is a good choice for me who likes to stay in hotels. If the hair dryer is replaced by dyson, it may be more friendly to fairies with long hair. For those who don't pursue the landscape, the luxury king bed (twin bed) is more cost-effective. Out of the hotel door is the igc, which perfectly solves the problem of shopping and eating. The hotel's customer service staff, Flora, Ally, and Kaley are all very kind (there was a little fat handsome guy who forgot his name when I first stayed), and the feedback from the room request before check-in to after check-out was very nice.

After reading a lot of reviews, I decided to book the Conrad Hotel with trepidation.
I was already mentally prepared to lower my expectations.
However, after arriving at the hotel, I found that the service was very good! The little brothers and sisters serving in front of the door are very enthusiastic and serious. Scanning the code is very important, and they are meticulous.
The handsome guys and girls at the front desk are also warm and patient to receive us.
The lady in the executive lounge on the 27th floor was also very considerate and helped me upgrade the room type, with large floor-to-ceiling windows on both sides, and a wide view!
After check-in, there are suki and Ally who are responsible for customer relations throughout the entire online service. My needs and requests were also very considerate and quickly responded to and resolved. Full butler service, great five-star hotel experience!
The cleaning is also very clean and fast, the non-smoking room has no odor, and the five-star standard is no problem.
Why are there so many bad reviews about the service? Anyway, I haven't encountered it, in short, it is a happy hotel stay experience.
I want to continue my stay, too lazy to change hotels, it's very good here!
Thank you to all the hotel staff for their hard work and dedication! awesome!

The location of this hotel is simply too satisfying, it is convenient to go out and call a car, and it is very convenient to go anywhere. During the epidemic, I didn't make any comments without considering public transportation, but I saw that the subway station was next to the hotel.
There are restaurants all around, which is not too convenient for lazy people like me!
The hotel is also very convenient to buy things next to the shopping mall, supermarket, bakery, Starbucks, miniso, Watsons, Sephora. If I knew it earlier, I didn't bring anything, just took the phone and came.

msg:Conrad is as good as ever. I stayed at other hotels two days ago. There were too many Internet celebrities and there were too many people and noise. I switched to Conrad. This time I went to Conrad and I was more satisfied than last time. The service attitude is really good. I really care about the feelings of the guests. Miss Flora speaks nicely and softly. The cleaning staff is very polite. They put all my cosmetics neatly one by one and put a towel on it. It is very polite and nice. The breakfast is also delicious. Every staff member is very good and responsive to every request. I later upgraded to a panoramic room. From that angle, I will choose Conrad next time💕 Oh, and a super cute cake🍰

The most irritating thing is that he said that he would waive the cost of breakfast for me, but in the end, he still paid all the bills. I really said one thing and did another. I have an idea. When I came 2 years ago, everything was fine, how can it be like this now.

Next to the hotel is Tianhui Square, opposite to Tiande Square and a street with old Liede style, so it is very convenient to eat, drink and play. The hotel's breakfast is also very rich, which can meet the requirements of a family. There is an indoor swimming pool on the sixth floor of the hotel, which is suitable for adults, and there is a small swimming pool for children to play.

You can eat and drink. You can also see the Canton Tower. Such a good view. The obvious disadvantage this time is that the room service was on the first day. There was no tea cup or glass in the room. On the second day, the room was cleaned. Looking at the service awareness everyone said, I feel that this stay is pretty good. Overall, 4.5 is not beyond the surprise, but I am also very satisfied.

msg:I really didn't expect that as a high-end brand hotel of the Hilton Group, Conrad, I didn't expect that the drinking water used is about equal to the pure joy of ice dew in a business express hotel. What's even more unexpected is that the average price is equivalent to that of Guangzhou's resident cultural Oriental, and there is only one 330ml bottle of beer in the mini bar. In my impression, the Beijing Conrad should be more than that. I tried to order more wine through the room service depar**ent, but no one answered the busy tone, and only after I switched to the concierge depar**ent did someone respond. In addition, as a frequent traveler of hotels with at least 50 room nights per year, it was the first time I called wine in a five-star hotel, and I ordered a bottle of red wine that was only 375ml. (Most of the 375ml wine is a complimentary welcome drink at the hotel)

In fact, what makes customers feel the worst is attitude. Of course, attitude is relative to subjective behavior. I only make statements. I have my own problems, but as a well-run hotel I am sure there are more secure solutions. My girlfriend is a teacher from Shenzhen University, and she needs to report to the school and three-day inspection when entering and leaving Shenzhen. In order to let the driver open the room without any hassle, we checked in and entered the room in this way around 10 o'clock in the evening.

After we had checked in and returned again, we encountered behaviors such as forcible questioning, tailgating, and elevator jamming by security personnel. The two service staff made me feel physically threatened.

Later, because I understood the difficulty of epidemic prevention and control, I went downstairs and actively cooperated with the registration. However, in the process of handling, they also did not feel the goodwill that they should have.

It is very understandable for the hotel's request, but only questioned the attitude of this hotel. As a high-end Hilton brand, Conrad is not a business or express hotel. I think it's entirely possible to have a more friendly attitude, rather than a blunt mechanical trea**ent on the opposite side of the customer. We are in-house guests and not employees under your jurisdiction. attitude decides everything.

All of the above can be understood as emotional issues, which have nothing to do with the hotel's cooperation with the epidemic, but only about attitude. Why do you let customers write hundreds of words in the middle of the night so they can't sleep? I think all the friends who will be staying should also be able to judge. The benevolent sees benevolence, and the wise sees wisdom. The star standard of the hotel is not only about the hardware, but also the service means, process, attitude and software settings. Hope Conrad gets better and better.

The feedback to me was that the smell of cologne in the room was very, very cold, and it could not be given to me. Because the plane was delayed many times, I was too tired, so I forced to go to the room to rest first. When I got to the room, the smell of perfume was really strong and outrageous... It was like spraying it just now. I don't know how the hotel cleaned it...

The check-in efficiency at the front desk of the hotel is not very high, but the lady and sister are not bad. The manager on duty is still enthusiastic, but he can't solve the problem.

This good thing went out for a walk, ate a meal, and then helped me clean it up.

The overall supporting configuration of the hotel, as well as the hardware materials in the room are good.

msg:My experience was that I was "blocked. The evaluation of Guangkang store on Xiaohongshu was bad. I regretted that I didn't listen to Xiaohongshu's advice, and ended up spending one night being humiliated and treated like a beggar in a hotel." Thank you, the 2,000 was well spent! Thank you for letting us know that female guests who suffer from being seen wrapped in bath towels can still be dealt with by using your condescension to "breakfast" and "upgrade the room"! It's because I don't know how to praise, I didn't accept your weirdness, and I didn't accept the "noble breakfast and upgrade"! I, a hotel beggar, am really tired of you!

msg:The Chinese New Year is coming, and I want to take my family on a self-driving food tour! Conrad did surprise me a lot! First of all, two 1.5-meter beds! There is also a bar street nearby, and the famous Bingsheng Mansion can be eaten a few hundred meters away. Highly recommend to try it! The hotel bathroom also comes with a sensor-type washlet, which is worthy of praise! Originally, I had to change to Mandarin Oriental for only one night, but the swimming pool here is indoors with constant temperature, and Mandarin is outdoor, which is not so comfortable. The child also likes swimming, so I asked the front desk, but I didn’t expect to meet Miss He Xinchen, the duty manager, who was very enthusiastic and helped me to renew my room at the best price. I heard that there was a problem with the remote control of the TV in the room and also helped me. For another room of the same type on a higher floor. Miss Zoey Ye at the front desk also gave a very warm service when checking in. To be honest, Conrad has lived in many homes, and this one surprised me! It's not necessarily because of the inconvenience of parking there, but I believe that a comfortable hotel experience is what every guest wants most! I think I will choose this place the next time I come to Guangzhou!

msg:Every December 31st is anniversary. This year the program is to find a hotel where you can see the Canton Tower and count down with red wine. Having lived in Conrad in Macau, I have a very good impression. The room is big and the environment is good. The service week, the epidemic can't run around, and I don't want to spend the holidays at will, so I chose Conrad in Guangzhou.
【Room view】
① We are on the 15th floor (the highest room type I can arrange that day), and the Canton Tower is clearly visible. Of course, the higher the floor, the better
② The window on the other side is very close to the office building next to it. Anyway, I will see people in the meeting room on the opposite side having a meeting. Later, Conrad's colleagues called back and I responded to the situation. They said that they put on a single mask, that is, they can't see the inside from the outside, so I will believe it... You must ask me why I opened the curtains, and I will tell you later.
【Room hardware】
① I like to separate the toilet and bathroom, and you can also choose a bubble bath and a shower for bathing. Take a bath with bath salts, take a dip in the evening and play with the purple duckling (I really like this noble purple from Conrad)
② There are two wash trays in the washroom. My husband and I can follow our own pace without accommodating each other. There is also a mirror TV on one side, which is very suitable for me who is dedicated to N use, and watch the news while washing.
③ Many of the small boxes in the room are purple that I like (purple is very bullying, it will be low if you get it wrong, but Conrad will not), but it is a little old
④ The floor needs to be criticized. There is a floor at the end of the bed that is already shaking, and there is a loose sound when you step on it.
⑤ Continue to criticize that except for the automatic curtain in the bathroom, the other two automatic curtains are linked together, that is, I close one side and the other side together, but normally, the guest only wants to open the curtain facing the Canton Tower. Yeah, why do you want to open the side facing the office building together? I have to consider this detail, although I can understand that they are considering the cost.
⑥ My husband and I brought the switch to play, but it took a long time to get it done, but the next morning I found a bunch of switch cables hidden in the purple box on the coffee table... We...
【Location】
Downstairs is the igc, which is very convenient to eat, drink and play. We went to Xingsheng Road to eat and then slowly slipped back to the hotel that night. There is also Tiande Food Street nearby, which is very convenient anyway.
In general, the price/performance ratio of Conrad on New Year's Eve is quite high, from the lobby service to the room view and facilities. But in order to be perfect, I hope Conrad can improve the details, such as the regular maintenance of the wooden floor and the control of the curtains can be one control one, not linked hahaha.

At the hotel, Ms. Ally took the initiative to call us after checking out to inquire about the check-in experience. This still made it feel like an old five-star hotel.

Then the hotel told me not to let the child sleep on the sofa in the lobby, or to let me hold her to sleep or wake her up. I told her that I was 7 months pregnant and it was inconvenient to hold her. While she was sleeping, others were busy checking out and they were about to leave. They told me that they couldn’t let me find another place. I really wanted to break the news. Finally, they told me to wake up as soon as possible so as not to delay other guests and rest in the lobby. First of all, I am a guest checking out here.

The night scene is blessed by a small waist, and the room space is really big enough. Although the swimming pool is a bit small, there are two open-air physiotherapy pools, which are a lot of extra points~
The public space is relatively small, but the refinement wins
The personnel software is still broken, and there is no sense of housing prices, even if it is 2000 nights, it should be the same~~
Four stars and a half are no problem, the difficulties of the service industry are all in the end~~
The hardware is worth this price, and the software...a bit of extra points, free soft drinks and snacks, don’t worry about the dozens of dollars, really good~~

msg:For my family’s birthday and Mid-Autumn Festival, I saw a few star hotels, and finally chose Conrad Conrad, specially booked a Conrad River View Room ~ the moment I entered the door, the scenery from the floor-to-ceiling windows really surprised me! Facing Xiaoman waist, I feel very happy when I look at it!

🍃Environment: Conrad's environment is really good, the river view room booked is right on the waist, and the room design in the hotel is reasonable. (1) The toilets, washrooms, and shower rooms are all separate and independent. Often people in our family want to go to the toilet when they take a bath. This just solves the problem and does not affect each other haha. There are also two back-to-back places in the wash basin to wash your face and look in the mirror. One of them is a mirror TV, so advanced! Let's talk about the toilet: the toilet is an automatic toilet. The toilet is warm when you sit on it. It will not be cold, and it will automatically flush. The toilet has no peculiar smell. This is particularly good! There is also a hand washing room with a magnified mirror, which looks like a haha mirror from a distance, but a closer look can magnify the face very clearly. It is very suitable for girls to apply facial masks and wear contact lenses. (2) The soundproofing of the room is very good, there will be no noise, and the outside sound is basically inaudible. (3) There is a mini bar in the room. The snacks and drinks inside are free. There is also a nespresso capsule coffee machine, which is very convenient to use. The hair dryer is vs. The TV is Samsung. (4) There are plugs everywhere in the room, so there is no place to charge.
🔔Service: A five-star is a five-star, and Conrad's service is also commendable, worthy of her star rating and price. The service staff will take the initiative to greet you when you take the elevator. As long as there is a need, the room phone will contact the reception desk and someone will come to help you solve it soon. My dad forgot to bring the charging cable. It just happened that the room only had an Apple cable. He told the reception desk at 1am that the staff would deliver it quickly, and because it was late, the staff hung up outside the door and called us to open the door. Take it and say it is the do not disturb mode. This kind of caring service really makes the guests feel good and attentive. And the little brother at the front desk at the check-in and check-out is so gentle and nice, and the service attitude is also super! We must answer any questions, and also gave us Conrad bear. Here we especially praise the little brothers Daniel and Harvey at the front desk. They are very patient and gentle, and the voice is super nice, and all questions are answered. In addition, because of the family’s birthday, the hotel also deliberately simply decorated the room and prepared small cakes.
💪🏻Gym: Let’s talk about the gym again, which is less mentioned by babies. Because I usually like to exercise, I am most interested in his gym when I come to the hotel haha! Hotels with good gyms generally have very good rooms, as expected! The view of Conrad’s gym is facing the Canton Tower, the floor-to-ceiling windows are very comfortable, there are few people, and the equipment is very new. The environment is quite good, very hygienic and comfortable. Playing sports here is really enjoyable hahaha! Generally speaking, every object in the Conrad room is not redundant and very practical. The hardware and services are very user-friendly. The family was very satisfied with this stay. It left us with a very good impression and it is worth staying again!

This hotel is fine in terms of hardware. The location and surrounding food are absolutely not picky.
But there is a lot of room for improvement. The front desk is very polite and the work is in place. I have been asked if I want to add money to upgrade the river view room. I myself don't have the intention of upgrading if the weather is not too good. I chose this hotel for my birthday that day. If you can pay more attention to see why the guests choose this hotel, or say a happy birthday, you have a sense of belonging to the guests. Of course I did not ask the hotel to provide anything. Of course the hotel did not provide anything. But it will be a surprise if there is any 😊.
The only thing was that the air conditioner had a problem on the first night, but it returned to normal after half an hour after contact. But it is a pity that I can't fall asleep after waking up in the early morning. Nothing was found the next day.

The categories sold by the swimming pool detract from the water quality of the pool, which is very inappropriate. Is it just such an income? This is only the case for outsourcing, right?
In addition, the air conditioner in the room was probably broken, and I couldn’t fall asleep in the middle of the night. The set temperature was 22 and kept running at 27. I don’t know why.
Free snacks and soft drinks in the mini bar are good, but the water distribution is Coca-Cola "Pure Yue", this cheap configuration is contrary to the positioning of the hotel
Finally, I complained again that the check-in time was too long, and it took fifteen minutes per person visually. There were only two people on duty at the front desk during the noon peak hours...Improve the efficiency.

There was no wrong choice, the room was clean and tidy, and the electronic toilet was exactly the same as my home, which was quite cordial. I have stayed in many hotels in the past, and even the nearby five-star Internet celebrities only use traditional toilets. Only staying at this hotel today is willing to invest in high-cost intelligence to prove its intentions. Disadvantages: The handle of the closet door is too inhumane, and it is hard to open. Girls now have long nails, which is very difficult to open.
I must praise the administrative corridor. It must be because of the epidemic. The food is not like the extravagant show of hotels in the industry a few years ago. But it feels real, at least it is very satisfying to eat.
The concierge is also very good. When I left the house early in the morning, I quickly arranged the vehicle on a phone call and liked it.

The only thing I don't like is the electric kettle, which is not intuitive to use. Although the appearance is good, the ordinary electric kettle is more intuitive to use. The night view is first-rate, and the contrast between the floor and the surroundings is not high, but the brightness facing the waist is the best in this area. In the future, I will live in a river view room.

The only bad thing is that the curtains are transparent, and the curtains over the bathtub are too transparent. They are transparent at 7 o'clock in the morning.

The geographical position is superior, all you can eat, drink and play

·

▷Disadvantages:
The small waist can be seen unobstructed in the room, but it is a pity that the whole building is relatively short, and I feel that there is no beautiful view of the Rosewood Hotel

The overall hotel feels a bit old

I think the price of this price is quite high in Zhujiang New Town, and the river view is also good

It may be an epidemic, but it is generally fine to control the number of admissions. It is too exaggerated to close all at once, so there is nothing to experience.
There is no view in the arranged room. The size of the TV in the room is too mini. In addition, the remote control for TV shows is difficult to use. The only thing that is better is the good service attitude.
The breakfast bar is also very general. There are no special dim sums in Guangzhou, which does not match the level of a five-star hotel, not as good as Marriott's.

再説説房間，設施齊全，挑不出一點毛病。尤其是那個浴缸，孩子説想在裏面泡個一整天！雙1.5米大床，更是帶娃不二之選！！！
而且，酒店的服務也超級給力！從入住到離店，每一個小細節都透露出酒店對客人的用心和關懷。特別是賓客關係部的Sam和Celine，他們在我入住期間還特地來回訪我，真的是超級暖心。當我有關於早餐種類的問題時，他們不僅耐心解答，還積極採取措施，確保早餐服務能滿足我的需求。這種積極主動的服務態度，真的是讓我對他們的專業水平和服務質量豎起了大拇指。
總之，這次廣州康萊德酒店真是不虛此行，強烈推薦！

酒店下樓就到igs天滙商場，入住後就下樓到商場依格寶沙龍剪了個頭發（推薦！），然後可以去御膳湯品吃飯，哪裡都是步行可達。

前台取行李服務和迎賓小哥熱情主動，幫忙開車門。離店後賓客關係部還專門回訪，後來發現落了一條褲子在酒店，也及時幫我郵寄回來了，賓至如歸的服務。下次還來

msg:1.房間還是不錯的，畢竟大品牌的品質沒的説。
2.客房服務還行，前台辦入住的小姐姐還是比較熱情的。
3.有點不爽的是，寄行李處的那個女服務員沒笑臉板着個**臉特別不爽，借個傘也是不情願回覆借光了，也不想着為我們客户解決問題。寄行李也是很不情願。
4.那外賣也是特別費勁，這麼大酒店連個機器人也沒有，還要跑下樓拿快遞。連亞朵全季都有的設備，真的很落後。
整體來説，沒有廈門和杭州的康萊德服務好，身為廣州一線城市酒店還沒有二線城市服務質量好，同樣的酒店還是有很多提升的地方。

服務態度：主動熱情，第一，在入住時，給了轉角房，轉角房兩面窗户，前台做了詳細説明。第二，服務人員都能主動問好。
地理位置：毗鄰igc廣場，到廣場有專用通道，下廣場逛超市買水果很方便。早茶去點都德，步行七八分鐘；晚餐到炳勝，步行也衹要七八分鐘。對面是獵德的步行街，餐飲一條街。
不足：房間配置了咖啡機和咖啡膠囊，但是沒有咖啡杯。紙巾衹配置在其中一個洗手枱上，房間沒有，有點不方便。

1，入住前根本無人問津和提前溝通，結果現場check in浪費時間，排房不冷不熱，熱衷推銷所謂升級套餐，哈哈，儼然高貴酒店作風。
2，最不可理喻的是下樓忘記拿口罩，想去前台拿，問了，美女説沒有，很乾脆，再問，就是沒有，仍然高貴酒店作風。
3，酒店確實是希爾頓高端品牌，衹是員工感覺用錯了，應該是更好的服務，而不是不屑一顧的態度，真的就這麼高高在上嗎？
4，吐槽，酒店房間制暖效果差，工作人員查看了也搖頭，就這樣雙床也衹能給加一床被子，好吧，再配一台老式油叮，哈哈。
5，淋浴熱水温柔，瑟瑟發抖，無語。

首先硬件，酒店房間一股地毯長期沒有清洗的奇怪味道。
最重點得服務，前台工作人員態度奇差無比，跟高高在上一樣，一邊看着手機，一手用眼神跟你交流，不知道他們得工作所有得酬勞最終都是消費者傳導的嗎，前台得josh服務特別差。
酒店致力於提供客人極具特色的頂級設施與服務。作為希爾頓酒店集團旗下最高級別的超豪華酒店，康萊德酒店不僅是希爾頓集團的集大成者，更是世界上最奢華酒店的代名詞。其以希爾頓創始人——康萊德·希爾頓（CONRAD HILTON）的名字命名。不知道管理層怎麼看待創始人得理念，一個品牌創立需要大量得時間跟經營，但是毀掉的話卻很簡單。
從未有過一個酒店如此體驗糟糕，服務流程讓人感到如此之噁心，如果非要我給建議的話，我建議他們去周圍其他酒店實習幾天，看看同級別酒店別人是怎麼做的。

msg:非常好的一次入住體驗，首先入住前收到酒店Ally的電話，詢問了到酒店時間，瞭解我們對住店有什麼要求，然後我們把想法
告訴了Ally小姐姐，當我們第二天在前台辦理又住手續，得知已經給我們的房間升級了江景房，房間還很大，非常感謝Ally. Chris. 前台小陳的幫忙，下次來廣州還會入住康萊德酒店。

晚上樓上洗澡的水流聲很大，半夜1-2之間聽着在水管漏水的聲響難以入眠
衞生間裝修的釘子什麼都裸露在外
椅子的四根腿，有三個隔音塑料套，第四個不知去哪了，坐着很不穩妥！
電視機遙控器沒電，更換下需要2波人，等待了半個小時多

在反映以上問題是，工作人員態度傲慢，敷衍！不積極的去處理
總體來説，作為高檔酒店，不值這個價格

msg:這位****小姐應該是貴酒店的千金來體驗生活的，在check out 時各種白眼，敷衍不尊重人，一副愛住不住的調子，最後還要對你來一句：“慢走，不送”!!!真是花錢找氣受。
讓她白眼的原因：1.因為實際結算房費和續房時確認房費不一，無故漲價，甩出全英文賬單，不會給你解釋和特別説明，她的表情彷彿告訴你：“我愛標多少就多少價，沒有標準，管你住不住。”
	
2.剛入住也是遇到同樣問題，實際入住價格和攜程上訂的價格不一樣，到了酒店坐地起價，會找各種理由給你加價，我們也就算了，結果check out又來一出。
最後投訴也無門，最可笑的是，詢問旁邊的工作人員索要投訴電話和員工名字，連名字都不是提供真實的，説叫***[汗顏R][汗顏R]當我們是**？
	
真是活久見，住了三晚也沒提出任何無理要求，不是帶着孩子今天真要掰扯到底。
想問下大家有沒有遇到過類似問題，可以去哪裡投訴？
	
最後奉勸大家千萬不要踩蕾，訂房之前應該來小紅書看看，沒想到差評一大堆，簡直就是一生黑，第一次住到這樣差的五星級酒店和如此傲慢的前台千金大小姐……

設施：馬桶是自動馬桶，很智能。有健身房，健身房不錯！
衞生：乾淨
環境：離小蠻腰步行距離，每天沿着臨江路跑步，很好。周圍購物方便，旁邊有網紅Gaga餐廳
服務：酒店員工服務意識很強，並且很快速。打電話要水和拖鞋，客房大姐很快速送來。禮賓部的員工每天進出都主動打招呼，跑了一圈步回來，一句歡迎回來，讓你真的覺得賓至如歸。
 下次來廣州，還會選擇康萊德！

可是，接近兩千的房價體驗了快捷酒店的質量以及服務。首先房間不大，冰箱櫃子門是壞的，茶葉選品很快捷，枕頭很高不舒服。最過分是，我在健身中途餓了想吃東西，在門口的休息區上打開一碗甜品正準備吃，卻被服務員告知必須去游泳池外面的露天座椅才可以吃東西。經投訴，酒店服務人員來道歉，我問為什麼不可以在這裏吃東西，給我的理由竟然是“不太好”！
很多星級酒店都會在健身房配備香蕉蘋果等吃食，而且健身的人中途吃些東西補充能量也是很正常的事情，如果我是坐門口吃一碗螺獅粉這種氣味大的我被制止那是我不對，可我才吃一碗沒有氣味的牛奶芋圓，被制止的莫名其妙！同時，我也很疑惑，一個這個價位的酒店人員是如何培訓的，怎會沒有健身的常識。

首先辦好入住到房間後找來找去找不到拖鞋，原來根本就沒放，需要打電話叫禮賓部才補了回來；電視機的操作基本是沒辦法的，遙控器就像是廢的一樣；
然後廁所地板上有粘糊糊的也不知道是什麼液體甚至還有毛髮叫來值班經理都無法解釋！
重點來了，訂好的蛋糕當天下午就寄存了，填好了單據，結果晚上提前近一個小時就開始讓禮賓部拿上來一直找了足足一個多小時沒找到，最後本人親自下去才找到原來把房號都寫錯了，所以之前寫的單據就是白寫的！但是這樣一來時間已經過了，已經過了12點了！那原本來這裏準備過一個生日的想法還有什麼意義？此時時間已經晚上近一點，當班經理提議第二天的時間協商善後，結果一直到退房都沒有人來聯繫！
後續直到退房的時候另一位當班經理才來接手並轉達所謂康萊德酒店運營總監的處理方法，送一套洗浴用品表示歉意。對此我衹能説一個人一年衹過一次生日，而且是2月最後一天，對於客户的體驗，酒店可以説是毫不在意，無論衞生，服務，善後都差強人意！讓人極度失望！

廣州康萊德位置超好，旁邊的商場我們一天去兩三次，購物天堂。

但是吧，這康萊德怎麼感覺不一樣？首先就是房間內環境不像，有點像地方賓館。
其次服務也不像，感覺根本不匹配啊，天津的服務也不太行，難道國內的通病？！

衞生也堪憂，衞生間在房間的最角落，所以可能導致洗澡間的使用次數會增加。每次洗澡的時候，那股味道，真的令人窒息。
而且酒店空調也該清洗了，打開就很味，直接打噴嚏，不打開又熱，真的有些崩潰。這全景江景住的，有些不值了。

早餐也很一般，話説廣東那幾天的早餐沒有喜歡的，可能南方就是不一樣不習慣吧。

msg:衞生：也許春節期間客流量大，房間打掃不徹底，沙發旁邊還有小童牙具，洗漱用品配備不全，地上也有長頭髮，建議酒店配備泡澡袋，畢竟小童入住安全衞生還是第一位。

服務：服務很周到，洗漱用品很及時的送到了，幫忙保管行李，而且還延時退房。

環境：這個房型景色都被高樓阻擋，在酒店門口能看到廣州塔，地理位置不錯，出門就是獵德大街，有很多餐館，穿過獵德大街就能看到廣州塔夜景。

msg:這家酒店必須要給大大的好評！👍

從開始入住前兩天酒店工作人員跟我聯繫，説是升級了我的一間房型，我原本定的一個行政套房，一個行政雙床房，備註是希望能安排的儘量近一點，方便我照顧孩子。來電人員説為了滿足我的要求，他們升級了我的行政雙床房至江景行政雙床，我説好的，我以為其實就是挨着的或者在一個方向的兩間房，我説可以。

入住當天去27層辦理，服務人員很親切，並且讓我們先在行政酒廊邊用餐邊辦理，行李也已經被放到房間，結果一到房間我們簡直是驚呆了，這兩間房不僅挨着，而且把走廊的門關上，兩個房間就變成了一個大套房，足足將近200平，開始的時候快給繞暈了，具體看我發的圖片。

酒店位置也好，樓下的igc是個商超，地下有個超市，東西很全。有幾個連鎖的粵菜餐廳也很地道，最主要的是回酒店可以少曬太陽🌞。 走到海心沙，省博10分鐘，看夜景，做床都很方便。説到夜遊珠江，建議買大沙頭碼頭的工商銀行號遊船，我當時對比了很多家，不是沒票了，就是衹有一，二層的船票，衹有這家還有三層vip，特別提示：買三層vip!!!不要衹買三層船票，二者就差了30元，但是給你的感覺絕對不是衹有30元的區別，不要讓孩子們為了30元被攔在線外。

最後，我想説的是，我在康萊德，文華東方和瑰麗之間選擇了很久，我覺得對於我們家庭來説，我沒有選錯，第一次到廣州，四口之家，孩子比較大，對於房型，舒適度比較挑剔，康萊德是最佳的選擇！

第一天入住，12點左右到的，因為酒店三點入住，辦了手續以後就去吃飯了，前台説有空房間收出來給打電話。吃完飯逛街完回去快五點了，還是沒有房間，也沒打電話，又去喝咖啡，然後等了一個小時還沒有房間，最後一次前台交涉完五點多快六點才入住。
後期沒有作業床服務以為真的沒有，也沒在意。
但後面居然有一天，早上十點多出門，下午接近三點回來發現房間沒做衞生，立刻打電話給客房服務，説本來連續入住做衞生要預約的，否則作夜床時才給打掃。但是前一天是給做了衞生的，而並沒有做夜床。這種矇騙顧客的理由他們居然想的出來。
這酒店連快捷都不如，前台辦理入住時因為沒有房間就各種被哄騙，入住了客房部衞生又那麼拖沓，就門口禮賓還知道給拿行李開門。真的不會再住了，管理太差了。
歡迎水果盤子是疊一起隨意就放在迷你吧上了，培訓該做一做了。

這次體驗非常不好。

換了一次房，兩間房裡空調都不冷，悶熱。而且艘一股非常濃烈的空氣清新劑味道。
另外，床的中間是凹陷的。。。


除了新酒店，套房是不能輕易入住的。
