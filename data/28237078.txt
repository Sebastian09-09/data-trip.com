msg:The hotel concierge was so helpful and checking was smooth and easy. I was easy upgraded to the River view which I wanted and I liked the view. What was not clear from the start was which dining room I was supposed to use for breakfast.
On the most important note, I would like to Thank Chria who was working on the concierge on Saturday the 13th of April 2024. I needed help with getting a train ticket to Yiwu and he did everything for me from booking the car to Hangzhou East train station to Yiwu , got me the best available ticket to Yiwu. And when I was about to return, on short notice I contacted him to book a ticket for me, he did book for 18:06 but I was stuck in traffic in Yiwu , then asked him to cancel and purchase the 18:24 one..he did all these admin and even checked if I got to the hotel well. Until my departure, Chria was still checking if I needed any help, well done and thank you so much once again, Chria. Why I mentioned him specifically is on the day I was checking out, I asked another guy at the concierge to help me getting a train ticket to Shanghai, but he just told me to get a taxi to the train station and use my passport to purchase a ticket when I get there, that’s when I figured probably Chria was actually working beyond his job description and that was just excellent.

msg:(XENOPHOBIC HOTEL, STAY AWAY IF YOU ARE NOT ASIAN) I stayed 2023 with my wife ( all amazing) then 2024 I take my mother and it was a nightmare. First day we check they asked for 4000 RMB for deposit, I give them my credit card and they charged me 3 times, 12,000 RMB, they said it was a mistake, no problem after that. The second night the manager came to my mother room at night telling her to change room 3 times,  then my mother called me and told me that the hotel want her to take her out of the room, and I told her to close the door and don't pay attention. Then the next night we were at breakfast time and a guy came to our table talking loud and introduce him as Jone Xu, he asks us when we will be depart, we told him we will depart at 10 am, then he begins to ask the room numbers and we asked him why all this question at breakfast time, he said its normal, we were the only one in the breakfast room with that questions, Obviously is not normal, I have been in many countries and this is the first time I got assault at breakfast time. we were planning to stay 2 more days but the xenophobic attack make us leave the hotel immediately. I wrote an email to Jone Xu asking him for an explanation on why all the assault to us, he did not answer, then I email the reception asking for the money back from deposit and also ask them for xenophobic attack and Kevin Yang respond for the money issue but never respond for the xenophobic attack.  I will recommend if you are not asian to not stay at this hotel.

Before I booked I saw some comments saying the rooms are not that big. But I rather prefer cozy rooms sometimes you see some hotels with big rooms but you don’t feel happy staying there. Conrad It has everything you need gym, Sauna, swimming pool (small but nice ) and above all the view is amazing. We had also a great breakfast ( westerns and vines mix). For sure this is one of the best hotels I have been in China.

It was also upgraded. We decided to stay the next day. Jane and Lucky's thoughtful arrangements made me feel very comfortable. There were also thoughtful little cards and snacks in the evening, which was great! If there were some soft candies that children like and hand-brewed coffee that adults like for breakfast, I would like it even more, haha! Small suggestion: It would be more convenient for the hotel to prepare a few small stairs for babies, because the little ones are not tall enough, and they can only wash their faces, brush their teeth and wash their hands by holding them, which is a bit inconvenient. Everything else is very good. There is Raffles and MixC downstairs, so you don't have to worry about food and shopping.

The hotel facilities are generally in line with expectations. It would be better if the lights could be a little brighter.
The location is far from the West Lake Scenic Area, but it is very convenient to travel. There is Raffles City downstairs and Vientiane City next to it. It is a 3-minute walk from the hotel to Metro Line 4. It is also very convenient to go to the popular Longxiangqiao area. .
The only thing that's a little disappointing is that the hotel's breakfast is not particularly rich in variety and tastes average.

msg:As a guest who had high expectations for Conrad Hangzhou, I was extremely disappointed with the service of front desk employee Bevis during my recent stay.
First, Bevis's reception attitude was indifferent and lacked basic enthusiasm and care. When I arrived at the hotel, expecting a warm greeting and attentive service, Bevis just mechanically checked in without any smile or eye contact throughout the whole process. This attitude made me feel ignored.
Second, Bevis was extremely slow to respond to guest needs. When I asked some questions about the room and facilities, he did not give timely answers or solutions, but seemed absent-minded and sometimes even ignored my questions. This irresponsible attitude made me very dissatisfied.
Finally, Bevis' professionalism is also questionable. During the check-in process, I found that he was not familiar with some of the hotel's policies and procedures, and even made mistakes. This caused me to spend extra time and energy to solve the problem, which seriously affected my stay experience.

msg:Bevis, the front desk staff at Conrad Hotel Hangzhou: The service quality does not meet expectations
I recently stayed at Conrad Hotel Hangzhou and was expecting to enjoy a five-star attentive service. However, the performance of Bevis, the front desk staff, was disappointing.
First, Bevis's service attitude seemed indifferent and unprofessional. During the reception process, he lacked a smile and eye contact, and was indifferent to the guests' inquiries. For a front desk staff, smiling and being polite are basic professional qualities, but Bevis obviously did not do so.
Second, Bevis seemed to lack patience and care when dealing with guests' needs. When I had some special accommodation needs, he did not listen carefully, nor did he give reasonable suggestions or solutions. Instead, he just mechanically followed the process and completely ignored the personalized needs of the guests.
In addition, Bevis's work efficiency was also disappointing. When checking in, he was slow and inefficient, which made me wait for a long time. For a busy hotel front desk, efficient work is essential, but Bevis obviously did not meet this standard.
Finally, I would like to say that Bevis lacks the ability to communicate with customers and solve problems. When I encountered some problems during my stay, he did not actively solve them, but shirked responsibility and transferred the problems to other depar**ents. This lack of responsibility made me seriously question the service quality of Conrad Hotel.
In summary, the service quality of Bevis, the front desk staff of Conrad Hotel Hangzhou, was far from my expectations. His indifferent attitude, lack of patience and care, low work efficiency and lack of problem-solving ability have seriously affected my stay experience. I hope that the hotel management can pay attention to this, strengthen employee training, improve service quality, and ensure that every guest can get a satisfactory experience.

msg:Environment: The hotel is in a very convenient location, just above Raffles City. The first floor indoors is directly connected to the mall, and there are many shopping and dining options. Conrad is a relatively new hotel in Hangzhou in recent years. The interior is in a post-modern style. The sightseeing elevator to the high-rise rooms provides a panoramic view of all floors of the hotel and the surrounding business district. The lobby on the first floor has been decorated according to the recent Valentine's Day and Spring Festival, which is very suitable for checking in and taking photos. The room space is very large, and the bathroom area uses a large area of ​​​​marble design, which is highly ornamental. It feels like it will be very impressive when taking pictures (although I didn't take any pictures haha

Cleanliness: There is nothing to say. There is no big problem with the cleanliness of the entire hotel from the lobby to the guest rooms.

Service: I would like to praise the front desk Jane and the waiter Wang Rui by name. Before check-in, they called us to confirm the customer preferences and made corresponding arrangements. They also helped us upgrade the room type orz, and they also communicated appropriately during the stay to ensure our Check-in experience and additional needs are met. The hotel has also prepared a lot of little surprises, probably for the New Year. When I checked in, I received a super cute little card holder in the room. When I turned down, I also had a plate of small pastries, which were quite delicious, and were comparable to some high-end Western restaurants outside. It’s even worse than any of them. I’m very curious about where it was made, hahaha.

Facilities: All facilities are complete, and everything that a five-star hotel should have is available here. It is worth mentioning that the anti-slip measures in the bathtub are very good. The only drawback is probably that the TV in the guest room is a bit small and placed far away from the bed, which seems inconvenient.

From the moment I booked the room, he made arrangements for me, communicated on the phone, room type, and all aspects of hotel services that I needed. They arranged everything for me in advance and answered me one by one via WeChat, which was very timely. On the first day of check-in, there were too many people checking in at the front desk. LUCKY directly arranged a VIP channel for me to check in, allowing me to check in quickly. I forgot all about the room operations, and even sent a message to LUCKY Hangzhou Conrad after 9 o'clock in the evening. She was still very polite and helped me solve all my problems. When I checked out the next day, I went to the Temple of Wealth and was exhausted. LUCKY Conrad Hangzhou was also considerate of my hard work climbing the mountain and helped me delay my check-out. Very patient, told me not to rush and let me have a good rest. The hotel also upgraded me from a junior suite to the largest room. It's my ideal room. Enjoyed a one night stay. When I checked out, I drank a bottle of soda water, which was free of charge. Although it is a small bottle of soda water, I feel that LUCKY's service is very comprehensive. Stayed at Conrad once in 2020. Three years later, I came back to live here and I felt that things had changed a lot. Management is getting better and better. The service is getting better and better. Next time I come to Hangzhou, I will stay at Conrad Hangzhou.

I am really satisfied with the bed room, the plan for the next day's trip, the performances, surprises, etc. I will choose Conrad next time I come to Hangzhou. A special thumbs up needs to be given to Jane!

The hotel room and service are also very good. As soon as we entered the hotel, the waiter was very enthusiastic and helped us with our luggage, and then checked in.

The bath products inside are also from favorite brands.
The buffet breakfast the next day was also very rich. They asked us in advance if we wanted coffee or drinks and they would provide it after we sat down.

msg:The hotel is really a mess and does not meet the standards of a 5-star hotel. There were not many people at the check-in concierge desk at 5pm. There was no one to help me carry my luggage, and I didn't even ask. When I booked the hotel, I made a note that I needed a high floor, but when I checked in, the front desk told me that I didn't make a note. Forget all this, it's not a big problem.
The most outrageous thing came. The front desk told me that only one room was available. I would have to wait at least 30 minutes for a room on a high floor, so I chose the existing room. As soon as I entered the room, I saw the underwear left by the previous guest, right next to the bed. It was really outrageous. I don’t know how the housekeeping depar**ent checked the room. Can't you even see a pair of underwear that big? Because I wanted to drink, I looked at the wine glass in the cabinet. It was probably that no one had used this wine glass, and it was covered with a layer of dust. When the lobby manager came, he actually said that the wine glass had been polished and he didn't know how to explain to me that there was ash on the wine glass. I asked him to get two replacement ones for me, and he said that the two replacement ones might also be dusty. He actually asked me whether I should use disposable paper cups. It's really outrageous. The fruit plate that was given to me for the first time was not wrapped in plastic wrap. The oranges that were given to me were still shriveled, and the dogs would not even eat them. This is the attitude of a hotel in dealing with the most basic hygiene issues. The lobby manager was too anxious and asked me to change my room. So he took me directly to the new room, and then told me to go to the new room first, and then asked me to wait at the door for a while. I didn't want to wait outside, so I went straight in. After entering, the cup was still dirty, and there were two hairs in the bathtub that I didn't have time to take a picture of. I just don't understand. Can't you make sure the new room is clean before letting the guest change? Tossing back and forth. Finally, I couldn't wait any longer and asked me to upgrade it. At first I said I wanted to upgrade at a higher price, but the front desk told me that the room was fully booked. I think it’s normal to have full rooms on New Year’s Day. If you can’t upgrade, you can’t upgrade. Later, I asked the lobby manager why I had a room again. He said that it was because the guest could not be contacted for this room and he had not paid anything. He said that the hotel also bears the risk. If the guest comes in the end, the risk will be borne by the hotel. This is the most outrageous statement I have ever heard. I was really hungry, so I went to eat first. The lobby manager said that he and the front office manager would go check out a room for me. When I came back, the wine glass was exposed, but it was clean. I guess it was new (it was really a slap in the face because the wine glass in the cabinet was dusty, but the exposed one was clean). When I checked out, a man in black clothes, probably the manager, pressed the elevator button for me. At that time, I still had large and small bags, but he didn't even ask me if I needed to take them. The entire management is like this from top to bottom. You can imagine how rubbish this hotel is. The concierge won't help or ask, and as a manager, he won't ask or help. Maybe this hotel doesn't help guests get their things and they can go up without asking. The most rubbish hotel I have ever stayed in. I didn't want to write a bad review at first. I told their lobby manager the night before that no one was helping me with my luggage. The guest manager also said that it was the hotel's fault. When I checked out the next day, I didn't want to leave a bad review. so. This is really the first time I have seen a five-star hotel without the most basic services.

msg:Let’s put it this way, although it opened in 2019, after all, it has not been open for three years due to the epidemic. So in theory, as a newly opened hotel, the price is nearly 3,000 per night. I almost caught a cold in the shower at night. The corner view is OK, but the air conditioner is not Even if it's awesome, the hot water is still lukewarm no matter how hot it is. This is not a problem that a hotel of this level should have.
Environment: Overall it's okay. After all, the high-rise building and sky lobby won't be too bad.
Service: It really needs to be improved. The aunt in the public area toilet came to clean the room without knocking on the door. The guy who greeted the hotel elevator asked for a long time and said he didn't know where the breakfast was. I was originally going to give the service three stars, but I gave it one more star because of LUCKY's enthusiasm and attitude. Of course, I don’t know if I have any ideas for coming next time. After all, there are still a lot of better hotels in Hangzhou. I hope there can be improvements.

The room and service are not as bad as what was reported online. I personally felt pretty good after staying there for two days. The waiters at the front desk and on the executive floor are friendly and will greet you when you encounter them at the stairs.
! The only shortcoming is that there is no butler service and no guest relations, so I don’t know much about the hotel. I went to have breakfast at 10:00 and it was already over. I hope that the meticulous service can be improved. Everything else is acceptable (the soft drinks in the executive room can be richer)
Finally, I would like to thank the little brother who helped me upgrade to a river view room on the day of check-in🙏

Not recommended. The advantage is that there is everything downstairs, so there are many choices for dining and it is convenient. At the same price, if you are traveling, I would recommend the Dahua Hotel next to the West Lake.

msg:Checked in for the second time, this time with friends. I have long heard that the executive lounge at Conrad Hangzhou is good, so I booked an executive room this time. Guest Relations Lucky contacted me in advance and inquired about my needs. I told her that I wanted a high-floor room, so I arranged a room on the 49th floor (a total of 50 floors, and the 50th floor is the "Li·an" restaurant). The view is quite good. The room size is not particularly large, but it is comfortable and sufficient. The bedding is also very comfortable and the quality of sleep is guaranteed. The hotel turned us down in the evening and especially praised Lucky for his guest relations and responsiveness to our requests. Our overall favorable impression of the hotel skyrocketed. And the service attitude of Jacky in the executive lounge is very good. She made a lot of cocktails for my trouble, hahaha, and they are all very beautiful and delicious. Coupled with the night view outside the executive lounge, it is quite impressive~ The breakfast is also delicious and rich as always. A very satisfying experience, and if there are no accidents, I will come again in the future.

msg:I used to live in the West Lake business district, but this time I decided to experience the night view of the CBD center and Qiantang River, so I chose Conrad, which opened in recent years. The price of more than 1,900 is still far from the value and experience I expected. The hotel has a special-shaped building and the rooms have heavy columns. Although it affects the mood, it is understandable. It was discovered that the bed sheets in the room were in an unhygienic condition, and the manager on duty immediately took corrective measures and basically took sufficient remedial measures. He was very satisfied with this. The new room is relatively open as shown in the picture, but an obvious flaw in the room is the unreasonable design of the safe. When you look down to find something, you will accidentally bump into it when you look up. My husband is like this, and it is also very dangerous. Hope it attracts attention. The hair dryer was an old-fashioned one with a long mouth. It was very heavy and hit my head several times during the process. There is also a small space in the hotel's breakfast room, and you have to queue up to get a table at peak times. This has not happened to other hotels. The quality and style of the breakfast cannot match the price of 299. Generally speaking, the appearance is attractive, but the interior is not able to attract people.

What’s even more outrageous is the reaction to the situation at the front desk. They acted like they were used to it and were not surprised. They were speechless.

msg:Deciding to go to Hangzhou was a sudden decision, because my nephew suddenly wanted to go rafting, so I immediately arranged it. It is very fast to go to Hangzhou from Shanghai Hongqiao, within 1 hour. After leaving the station, I booked a local bus to and from. In the afternoon, return to the hotel on Metro Line 4. Go to Exit B1 of Jiangjin Road. Then turn right to the intersection, cross the road and go right for a while. There are two or three stores on the first floor. You just need to see the one with the name written in the recess in the middle and then go in. Then take the elevator directly to the 27th floor for check-in. The attitude of the front desk staff is super good. The room hasn't been cleaned yet. It seems that we have been given an upgrade service. The higher the floor, the wider the view. Here I would like to praise such a service attitude, thank you. Then, if you have a lot of things and the room is not cleaned well, you can store it at the front desk first, and then go to the surrounding Raffles City and Vientiane City for a stroll. I'll come back later to get the room card. If you are a junior, a junior, and you need to prepare breakfast for your child, just inform the front desk. The elevator with the room card up has a nice view. The room is large and has a wide view. The function of the toilet in the bathroom. The shower room is also good, meeting your various needs for bathing and showering. The bed is quite soft, and you can fall asleep as soon as you pour it down. The breakfast is on the 27th floor. The dishes are good, and the drinks and fruits are fresh. Enjoy the scenery outside the 27th floor while eating. Overall, I am very satisfied with this stay. Then the service attitude of the staff is good.

The toilet is smart, but the curtains are not electric. The toiletries are very good. I planted grass directly and ordered the same set at the hotel. When I checked out, I originally hoped to be delayed until two o'clock, but the beauty in the service center said that the booking was fully booked, so I could only delay it until one and a half. Going to have breakfast at 8:30, there is a short queue. The breakfast is fairly rich, and the plum vegetable flatbread is an unexpected little surprise. When I checked in, I took the elderly with me and pulled the trolley case. There was no one in the lobby on the first floor to help with the luggage, and it was the same when I left. But I saw the waiter on the first floor helping other residents with their luggage. Why should it be treated differently? Generally speaking, the experience is good, and the flaws are not concealed. It should be a second brush!

msg:The 2 executive rooms I booked at the beginning did not match the pictures and requested to be replaced. After many times of coordination, I changed to a more satisfactory room type. The rooms in rooms 07 and 08 of the hotel are a little larger than other room types of the same level. Besides the administrative courtesy, there is no welcome fruit in the room. It is said that the welcome fruit is distributed randomly until supplies last. This is the first time I have heard of it since I stayed in the hotel. The executive lounge is in the form of set meals from Monday to Thursday, and in the form of self-service on weekends. I don’t know about the form of self-service. My son said that the view from the window was not as good as the view from the apar**ent next door, hundreds of dollars a night. The height of the hotel's swimming pool is too low and the swimming pool is not big. It's too depressing for me who doesn't go into the water to watch my children. Adding WeChat in advance to understand the needs feels like a formality, and it does not solve most problems. The hotel's bedding is a plus point for the hotel. Generally speaking, the price of 2000➕ is not worth it. Possibly too high expectations. But the taste of breakfast is not bad. The freshly baked plum cake is really worth trying~

First of all, the guest experience Lucky called in advance to arrange a room, and even upgraded me, very warm, attentive and thoughtful! The room is also very clean and tidy, the hotel environment is stylishly designed, and the shopping mall Raffles downstairs is very convenient for eating and so on!

The aunt who cleaned the room after staying here saw children, so she went to get the children's toiletry set and gave them toys! All in all, it was a great staying experience 😁😁😁

msg:Came here from Xiaoshan Airport to stay for one night. The next day, we took the high-speed rail in Hangzhou East. The location is good for eating, drinking and shopping. Of course, it’s good to sleep comfortably. The most important thing is that when we arrived at the hotel, it was already It was around 12 o'clock, and the concierge service was quite online. I knew there would be a bear doll as a gift, but I was afraid that the room was not available, so I asked specifically. As a result, the concierge sent three. The children were very sensible and thanked the staff for saying that there was no need to let the bear accompany them. For the other kids, I’ll just have one. I missed breakfast because I was too sleepy, so I’ll definitely try breakfast next time I have a chance to stay. Although the room type is in the corner, it doesn’t affect the view from the window, and the double bed is wide enough to sleep with a baby It won't be cramped ~ recommended! This invincible Jiangjing instant noodles are delicious, and the quality of the bear is nice! My daughter likes it so much! Children friendly recommended to live

2. The executive lounge has an invincible river view, and afternoon tea with children is particularly relaxing!

3. The swimming pool has a constant temperature of 28 degrees, and the depth is 1.2 meters suitable for children. The changing room is clean and has no peculiar smell. The spa and sauna equipment are very new!

4. The location is super invincible, the invincible river view, every Tuesday and Saturday 🈶️ light show, downstairs is the Raffles City mall, all kinds of delicious food can't be eaten, delicious and easy to shop!

5. Special thanks to Lucky from Conrad Hotel, who helped us arrange the whole itinerary and cared about us throughout the stay. The children said it was as comfortable as going home, and we will choose Conrad next time!

The day before arriving at the store, the front desk came to the store to confirm and asked about the room requirements in detail. The day of arrival at the store was later than expected because it coincided with the 5.1 holiday. When you check in, the staff will help you check in with your luggage.

Booked an executive twin room, the room is very spacious and has a pleasant view. The layout of the room is also very reasonable, the bathroom has a large space for bathing, and the family is not crowded at all. Knowing that it is a family of three traveling, the hotel thoughtfully prepared children's toiletries and slippers for the children. In the afternoon, I went to the executive lounge for a cup of coffee and some snacks. The coffee in the lounge is quite good, and the small snacks are also exquisite. Great for an afternoon break and chat.

Dinner went to Li'an on the 50th floor. The decoration of the restaurant is simple and elegant, and the service staff is kind and considerate. We ordered several of the chef's specials and it lived up to its name. Each dish will also give us a brief explanation of the ingredients and characteristics. The family is very satisfied.

Although the hotel is not in the West Lake Scenic Area, the transportation is convenient. It is very friendly to self-driving and has convenient parking, and it is not far from Qiantang River. After dinner, you can go for a stroll along the river, which is comfortable and pleasant. The view from the hotel is also very good. The Raffles City downstairs is very lively. There are many catering shops and Hema, which is very convenient. The hotel thoughtfully presented fruits and chocolates, which are top-notch in terms of shape and taste.

Special thanks to the hotel manager Helen, who added WeChat when I checked in. Any needs will be answered in time. After leaving the store, I found that a hat was missing, because I helped to find it and express it.

Next time I come to Hangzhou, I will choose Conrad again!

Even if I raise a question, the waiter will reply after checking that it is like this on the 45th floor where you live, but not on other floors. Why don't you ask the customer if you mind when you check in? Not enough water pressure? Another point that I am very dissatisfied with is that for breakfast at ten o'clock, there is basically nothing to eat. The waiter will not remind the customer.

Nice 😊The hotel's buffet is of very good quality. It happened to be Easter that day, and the children were free of charge and there was an Easter egg activity. We had a great time eating🥳

Can the ducklings make smaller ones and give them to customers? They are so beautiful and you can only buy them separately. Why are you so bad?

msg:1. Location: The surrounding environment is very convenient. Quiet, clean, with a park, convenient to the riverside.
2. Breakfast: very disappointed. Maybe my expectations are high. Because I think the brand positioning of Conrad is similar to that of Ritz-Carlton, so I expect the brand experience equivalent to Shanghai Pudong Ritz-Carlton. However, the overall level of Conrad breakfast is very poor. There is also less food variety, and the taste and overall quality of the dishes are also low. It is worse than the Intercontinental Hotel in Shanghai between 700 and 900. A hotel that costs 2,000 yuan a day has to queue up for breakfast. In addition to the hotel's name, it cannot keep up with the top international hotel brand positioning.
3. Service: Employees can work on everything. The cleanliness of the room and all the services of the concierge are very satisfactory. Very quickly, the customer said a word to 10 services.
But especially the front desk. The customer reception service process is not perfect enough. There seems to be no systematic training. It is a kind of positioning of a very kind staff who handles opening procedures. The basic hotel information of the introduction is not mentioned. Such as breakfast restaurant and time. In addition, there is no information on the use of the executive lounge. It was only when I checked out that I found out that this kind of service existed.
In terms of overall service, the leadership does not pay attention to service, and there is no sense of the internal system of service management.
4. Room: I live in room 7. You can only see the view of the construction work. Not worth the price. Therefore, another room type is recommended. Because the location of room 7 is not included, the organization of the room is also strange. The location of the TV, the location of the fish tank and bathtub in the bathroom, etc. ah! The design and size of the bathtub is not at the level of 5 stars.
5. Recommended crowd: It is most suitable for people who want to show off "I have been to Conrad" for the purpose of staying. People who do not have the experience and expectations of a 5-star international hotel. Don't consider the price/performance ratio and heart-to-price ratio. People who don't pay attention to the quality of service are also ok.
6. Summary
1) A hotel that relies entirely on young people who love online celebrity shops.
2) Contrast

Conrad headquarters will be surprised to see such customer reviews. It's a pity that there are only more than 20 top hotels in the world whose reputation has been damaged by Conrad in Hangzhou.

This time I just casually mentioned that it's Mr.'s birthday. I didn't expect the guest room manager to give me a surprise. I upgraded the executive room, Kang Ryder's administrative courtesy is still very nice. As a high-end line of Hilton, Conrad's service is also acceptable, and the breakfast is as rich as ever. The Rian upstairs in the hotel is a Black Pearl restaurant, and the service and dishes are naturally first-class. , Thanks again to the room manager for the upgrade and cake, I will still choose Conrad to stay next time

The lady at the front desk helped to upgrade the river view room~ The buffet is delicious~ Hahaha I recommend this package of Ctrip 1999, which includes the buffet in their own restaurant ➕The next day, I sent a small cake because I was married to my husband in the morning. The bath is very fragrant. Hahahaha, maybe men think it is too fragrant. There are huge bubbles~ Steak~ and the chef told me 50%~ Wow This is the buffet I want. Originally, the small hot pot was mushroom soup or tom yum kung, but Chengdu’s mouth couldn’t stand the light restaurant here. The waiter helped to find the chef to adjust the spicy pot and asked the chef if it wasn’t spicy enough. You can add it. It’s comfortable. It’s recommended and it’s in Xincheng The lighting of the building is very nice~ Next time I come to play, I hope I can take my dog to Tonglu Conrad to check in😍

msg:Because this year is quite special, the Chinese New Year will be in Hangzhou, so I booked the Conrad Hangzhou Hotel. The location of the hotel is quite convenient. It is just above the Raffles City shopping mall. It is very convenient for eating and shopping.

Environment: The environment of the hotel is quite good. The lobby is on the 27th floor with a beautiful view

Service: The service of the hotel is very good, the check-in at the front desk is also very fast, and the waiters are very enthusiastic. When we arrived at the hotel, the concierge immediately picked up our suitcases. After we checked in, the suitcases were delivered to our room

Facilities: I booked a river view twin room on Ctrip, and the hotel upgraded us to an executive room. The bed is bigger, the room is also big, and the floor arranged for me is quite high, so you can see the river view


Hygiene: The sanitation is very clean. The next day the waiter will take the initiative to ask if you want to do laundry. When is it more convenient to clean the room?

Facilities: The facilities in the room are also quite good. The bathroom is separated from the wet and dry. The shower and the toilet are separated. There is a large cloakroom and two washstands. I like this, so that two people can wash together. The toilet is automatic and quite comfortable
      The breakfast is okay, but I ate it twice in a row, and I feel that everything is similar. On New Year’s Eve, there is a buffet at the hotel. The price of more than 600 per person is not bad. There are foie gras, Boston lobster, papaya bird’s nest and other gifts, as well as a lottery. It’s worth it!
       I wanted to stay for two more nights, but unfortunately the twin room we wanted is gone, only the double bed room is available, and it costs more than 400 per night for an extra bed. I think it's a bit uneconomical, so I had to give up and choose another hotel
    I will still consider staying at the Conrad Hotel in the future, and I hope to stay in the off-peak season in the future, so I may still have a chance if I want to stay longer

msg:The famous Internet celebrity hotel in Hangzhou, there will be many Internet celebrities checking in and taking pictures in the early stage of opening. Located on the top of the Twin Towers in Hangzhou, the front desk is on the 27th floor, the highest guest room is on the 49th floor, and the Black Pearl Yilian restaurant is on the 50th floor.

The appearance and decoration style are really good, worthy of being a high-end brand under Hilton. The speed of the sightseeing elevator is very fast and the scenery is not bad. The slight disadvantage is that when I checked in at the store at 3 o'clock, I was told that the room was ready, but I had to wait for the check-in to be completed before I could check in. It was estimated that I would have to wait for about 20 minutes. We thought of stopping by the lounge for afternoon tea and waited, but after 40 minutes we finished our tea and continued to be told there was still a 20 minute wait. . . A whole black face question mark? ? ?

The quality and products of the lounge are good. Whether it’s afternoon tea, happy hour or sweet soup, I think their happy hour is better than breakfast. Is it ironic?

The facilities in the room are pretty good, but the speed of delivery is a little lacking, which is understandable during the Chinese New Year. The scenery is better. The river view is perfect when the weather is better. The smart toilet electric curtain is a decoration, but the curtain of a luxury hotel cannot completely block the light. This is very imperfect and will cause embarrassment to the holiday experience an experience of.

Generally speaking, there are not many problems, and some will pass with the passing of the year, but if you like to get up early for breakfast, it is not recommended to stay. The breakfast in this hotel does not seem to be worth getting up early. It is also recommended to extend the breakfast time during the Chinese New Year. 10 It's still a little early~

I had a good impression of Xiamen Conrad before, so I booked a deluxe river view king bed room (including two breakfasts) during the Spring Festival. The room is not as big as expected, the view is not as good as expected, and there is no fruit snack. But overall it was quite good, especially when there was a shower of snow early the next morning, the advantages of the hotel room at a high place were reflected. The environment is good, but the facilities are a bit old, for example, the outer leather of the desk is damaged. Because I didn't go to the swimming pool with my children. The location is very good, upstairs from Raffles City, next to Vientiane City (major shopping mall for luxury accessories), it feels like a CBD, I went to the mall and bought a bottle of Shuiman, which is quite good.

msg:Conrad Hangzhou is a hotel I really wanted to live in before. This time I came to Hangzhou to live. To be honest, I was a little scared and disappointed.
Check-in was good. I gave a room on a high floor according to my idea.
Because there is only one breakfast with my boyfriend, I added a breakfast. The deposit of 3000 will be refunded after deducting the room fee and breakfast fee.
Then things start to get outrageous, abstract
When I went back to the hotel at night and saw the lounge, I wanted to go up to have a drink. I asked the hotel service staff at the elevator door what time the lounge was open. He didn't know, so I asked the front desk. . Ok . . Then don't go. .
I'm a bit of a clean freak. . After going out to play at night, I planned to take a bath when I came back. I saw a "hair" in the bathtub. I don't want to elaborate on the hair. It should be visible when cleaning the room. The cleaning is not very careful. . It is also recommended that girls bring their own disposable bath bag if they want to take a bath in the bathtub when they go out. It is clean and hygienic. I don’t really want to take a bath with other people’s hair.
Then I closed the curtains and started to take a shower. I have long hair and take a shower. It takes 20-30 minutes to take a shower. After I take a shower, I come out and prepare to go to the sink to get a towel. I just finished taking the light and the room is pitch black after 3 seconds. I can’t see my fingers. There is still a glimmer of light in the tight curtains. (Here I have to praise the hotel curtains are good and the shading effect is quite good.) My idea is whether the hotel has a power outage or someone has entered the room? ? Because I was not familiar with the house type, I slowly groped to the door of the room and turned on the light. At this time, the mentality was really broken, and the temperature from the bathroom to the room was also a bit worse. It was quite cold at that time. Then I called the front desk and said that there was no power outage, maybe the room was in energy-saving mode, and no one was sensed in the room. . 🥲 Fortunately, I didn't fall and nothing happened. This energy-saving mode can also understand power saving or something, but there are people in the room, I think it is still not very smart. .
For breakfast in the morning, I found that there were a lot of people when I checked in. I was afraid of being crowded, so I got up early to eat. I sat in a good place and it was very quiet. After I finished eating, the restaurant was already very noisy, and there were queues outside the restaurant waiting to eat. .
I thought the minibar was quite sincere and full, and there was no bill. I thought it was free, but when I checked out the next day, I was told that I would be charged. . This is to put the charge sheet around the minibar. Many hotels offer it for free, which is easy to get misunderstood. But because of the above-mentioned incident of running out of electricity in the shower, Manager Zhao helped me reduce it.
When I checked out, Manager Zhao apologized for my reaction. It was actually nothing because I was not injured, but the rest of the experience was not very good.

Facilities: The TV in the room has always been broken and I am too lazy to replace it. It is not an electric toilet. The hair dryer is also an ordinary brand. The room facilities are very simple.


Hygiene: Generally speaking, the cleaning of my room has been pretty good since my stay. They help me fold my clothes every day, but the hygiene of the toilet and bathroom in the room is really not good enough. There are hairs in the corners, including cigarette butts at the elevator door in the public area. There are cigarette butts when I go out at noon. At 8 p.m. The same cigarette butt is still there...


Service: There are many rooms, but the service is average and not timely. Maybe it’s because I have to change to the elevator.

Let’s talk about the hotel’s food and beverages
The Japanese sashimi was very fresh, the sukiyaki pot and the beef were too average. The set meal didn't look very attractive. When I checked out, I didn't take the initiative to ask if I was a hotel guest because I could get a 10% discount for staying in the hotel, but as soon as I swiped my card, I said it couldn't be refunded. There was no way to change it. Two people ate three or four thousand. Finally, they said that the kitchen was off work to make up for the two ice cream balls we had.

Chinese food on 50F. I forgot what it was called. It’s better to eat at lunch. You can have a view. You can eat at night. You can’t see anything from the same seat🥲. The service is very good and very considerate. It can be said that the service is attentive. But the taste of the food is average. It seems to be Black Pearl? There was a crispy chicken that I had from the Golden Sands Restaurant of the Four Seasons Hotel the day before. It was the same type of chicken, but there was a real difference! ! There is a seasonal pear stew, which soup is good? It tastes good. There is a braised pork recipe where the beef is very greasy. I don’t recommend it. The lobster mapo tofu is just average.

Finally, let’s talk about the location
It is very convenient to get nucleic acid when you go out and go down the stairs. During the epidemic at Raffles City, there is no direct access to the hotel, but the shops in Raffles City are... very average and there are no good restaurants. In comparison, I take a taxi to Hupao or Hupao every day. It is more convenient and comfortable to walk to Vientiane City to eat and drink.

I won’t go into details for the specific reasons! Friends can view reviews. It was Eden who received me. I was very impressed with her, because as soon as I gave the ID card, she said the remarks I left when I made the reservation. I am very satisfied. I will give her another good review here. Sister!

msg:Very bad experience, poor service! The 1588 room coupon I bought has a catering quota of 500. When you check in, you can consult the detailed rules at the front desk and ask yourself to read the page? Didn't you have questions after reading the page, would you still ask? It's a bad feeling!
After checking in, I found that there was a big pillar in the room. I called to ask if I could change to a room without a pillar. I waited from 1:30 p.m. to 11:30 p.m. I made 2 calls to ask about the progress, but there was no feedback. People went to the front desk to try to consult. I was very busy and didn't have time to answer, until the third call to complain, and finally there was feedback. After 12 midnight, the manager on duty asked me if I wanted to change the jacket. It's midnight, what else should I change?
The equipment in the room is BYREDO. On the day of check-in, I met my aunt in the corridor and asked if I could send a set of travel clothes. She replied that I would give it to me tomorrow morning, but I didn’t receive it until I checked out the next day!
The breakfast is so-so, it's hard to eat a Benny. The only bright spot is that the nucleic acid point is downstairs in the hotel, and the bowl is from 6 o'clock to 11 o'clock, which is very convenient!
Overall not recommended! The service does not match the price at all! The price is not much different, the Park Hyatt Grand Hyatt not far away is much better than this one!

msg:1. The doorman of the hotel on the first floor will not help with bags or guide directions. 2. On the 27th floor, the hotel lobby is also very ordinary. When waiting for check-in, I can't feel the warm service at all.
3. The room at the same price is considered small, and the interior materials are very ordinary, and the room feels very depressing.
4. Breakfast is average, not worth looking forward to.
5. After checking out in the morning, I went to inquire about the refund of the deposit in the afternoon. At the beginning, I said that I could not find the information about my check-in, so I helped to transfer to the front desk, but there was no one at the front desk. I called in again, and I didn’t answer the phone directly. I was speechless🙄
The overall feeling is really bad, and the service attitude is also poor. It is a real Internet celebrity hotel, an Internet celebrity that dies after seeing the light

At that time, I lived in room 3518. The floor manager was also very considerate and thoughtful. He cared about the guest's check-in experience. The hotel's sanitation service was very detailed, even the swimming pool service was very considerate. The afternoon tea was not very good, and the environmental view was excellent. Sometimes non-hotel guests or non-dining guests come in to take pictures (similar to a clothing seller's show), which affects the mood and instantly lowers the quality of the hotel. The afternoon tea meal is very ordinary, without substantial content, and the four majors and one small cost 1300 yuan, The lobster in the set meal was baked with only the shell left. I wanted to change to a clean cup and was told to pay extra!

The view of the river view room is also good, and you can see the big golden ball.
In general, the online celebrity punch card is good, but there is no advantage in other same price points. It may be that as long as there are Internet celebrities to come to check in, the service is really average, and there is nothing very impressive.
I booked it for my wedding anniversary. My husband said that every hotel will stay there, so I asked for help to arrange it. Well, it did not meet my expectations. Maybe Hangzhou Grand Hyatt, Qingdao Shangri-La, and even Suzhou Shangri-La are better than them. . Grand Hyatt is really attentive to meet the needs of the guests.
The Bai Ruide for bathing tastes pretty good. The bathroom faucet is obviously not enough water pressure and the water is not big enough.

msg:The name is not worthy of the name. It was my first time to this hotel. I stayed in an ordinary deluxe king-size bed room, 4603. I feel that the design of this hotel is still alive 10 years ago?
1. Wouldn't the water inlet pipe and socket of the toilet be hidden behind the toilet? It looks similar to an economy hotel;
2. The bathtub is so small, about 1.5 meters by visual estimation. This is a five-star hotel. Do you have such a small bathtub for babies?
3. I don't know how the power socket is designed. It actually drags such a long wire on the ground. Not to mention the appearance, is it safe enough? Didn't you think it through when designing it?
4. The TV is visually 40 inches. Now the mid-range models are all equipped with 65 inches. Besides, your hotel has just opened, and it is out of date?
5. The curtains are not good at blocking light. Light leaks in the morning. It is really not friendly to people who are sensitive to light. The guest rooms are not checked regularly?
6. The curtains are manual, and there are no electric curtains? Hanting Hotel has electric curtains. Is it worthy of a five-star rating?
7. There is a big cylinder in the corner of the guest room, which is simply **. Was it so simple and crude when it was designed? The designer is too good. Although the property is complex, it is not solved from the design level, and I can't see what is good about this hotel;
8. The guest room area is said to be 50 square meters, but it is estimated that about 40 square meters are actually used. Is the 50 square meters you gave the building area?
In my opinion, except for the location, it can only be said that this is a perfunctory hotel without any effort.

msg:It is the first time I have come to Ctrip to book a hotel so many times: I will not come back to this hotel. On Friday, I drove my family of four to stay in a double bed for a long time. The WeChat service and the check-in lady in the front section were very good. The requirements and details were very clear and friendly. The room service aunt during the day on Saturday was also very kind and asked. What was missing? My family's slippers got wet, so my aunt gave me two more pairs. I didn't have enough conditioner at night, so my brother sent a small bottle of conditioner to help at 11 o'clock. My mother was very touched by these details and left a message to praise them. However, on the last day on Sunday, because we stayed for 4 people, the conditioner was still not enough. A new and younger room service staff said, how is the conditioner? not enough? Came in and looked at it, but it didn't come out after pressing it a few times, and then squeezed it out a little bit, which meant that we could squeeze it out a little bit more. I'm too lazy to talk nonsense with her. Since your hotel is reluctant to take care of this point, you can simply put all the travel bags and give them per head. I just wanted to ask if I have to call you halfway through the wash and ask you to come up and squeeze the conditioner for me? The skin care lotion on the side of the sink is also gone after a few pumps. Really speechless. Long-haired sisters must live, please squeeze out the wash first! So as not to wash half of it is gone!

The room is cleaned and the bed is very soft and very sleepy. They also take the initiative to help us to delay the check-out. The hotel is very close to Vientiane City. Shopping is very convenient. There is a nucleic acid point at the entrance of the hotel. There are fewer people downstairs. Fushi also eats a lot. After check-out, the experience officer will also ask about the service of ROSE.

Echo at the front desk helped us upgrade the room type, and we can see part of the river view. The hotel breakfast does need to queue up as everyone said, as there are not so many, but the quality of the food is still good.
There are two shopping malls around, and the entrance is near the nucleic acid point, which is very convenient. I will choose it next time.

Moreover, the beds are large, each bed can sleep 2 adults, and it also includes early breakfast for 2 people, free parking, Byredo bathroom products, and super fragrant body lotion. The only downside is the Japanese restaurant, which is super expensive, but not really that delicious. Lunch is 1,000 per person per person. I won't go there next time. Anyway, there are Raffles City and Mixc City nearby, which is super convenient. Easter eggs, the downstairs of the sprinkle shop is the nucleic acid point, which is super convenient.

Are you sure it’s Conrad, not an express hotel? I don't know what to clean in the room. There are various water stains on the glass door of the testing institute, and there are two fingerprints on the shower door. What was the previous tenant doing in the toilet? Can't even think about it. The hotel opened in 2019, the seams are glued, I am really curious about how it is maintained 😅 No wonder it was removed from the list by fhr and Ctrip Golden Diamond 🙂

Hygiene: The cleaning lady is very responsible

Service: I have to mention the service here, because the health code changed color when I came to Shanghai from other places. I contacted the front desk of the hotel to inquire about the community hospital and answered the questions. I was very patient. Because I had to return to Shanghai early the next morning, and I didn't have time to order breakfast, the staff [Xiaoyu] reminded me carefully and helped to coordinate. Because it was too late to come back to pick up the luggage, I helped to register the mailing address, and the luggage arrived.

The hardware facilities are really good, the design is strong, and it is diversified; it is just that there are a few spare parts, and people like me who don't care can be ignored. The service is even better, from the front desk to the restaurant to the fitness center, not once did I feel embarrassed/uncomfortable. Especially Lucky, who helped me check in, is young, but very professional and has a sense of proportion. I give her a special compliment.

I came to Hangzhou to experience a West Lake 520 and chose Conrad. I like it super invincible. The room is big, the hotel is super new, and it is very convenient. Next to it is Vientiane City and Raffles City. The key is that it is very close to the scenic spot, only 5 kilometers away. The train station is about the same distance. Anyway, I lived very happily. Miss Yuki helped with the check-in. She was super nice! The last thing to say is that their full set of hair and shower gels are all byredo wilderness lonely souls. My Favorite Fragrance Brand + My Favorite Smell. I usually use this one myself, so when I saw it, I was stunned, fate! Hahaha love love love
🔔Service: perfect score💯Super good, Miss Yuki is kind-hearted
🍃Environment: Clean and spotless, after all, it is the famous conrad
🚗 Transportation: Super invincible and convenient!

Check-in on the 27th floor, open the elevator door and see a good view, check in with my sister, the front desk helped us upgrade a double bed for free, knowing that we left early the next day, help us prepare breakfast in advance and wait for us at the front desk checkout
The room on the 35th floor has a very good view. The room is very new and clean. There is a feeling of seeing the mountains and small.
The location of the hotel could not be better, it is super convenient to go to Raffles City, Vientiane City and TZ House
Thanks to Randy because he knew we didn't take Kang Kang Xiong, so he specially helped us to send it home, super love!
Thanks Conrad, it was a great time!

One is to upgrade the smart toilet, and the other is to change the brand of toiletries, and use large packaging, which is more environmentally friendly and supports. These details reflect the hotel's intentions. I stayed for 4 nights this time. The biggest feeling is the comfort of the service. From the front desk yuki taking the initiative to help upgrade the river view room, to the friendly greeting of the cleaning aunt in the aisle, and the attentive service of breakfast and the lobby bar. I work in the lobby bar every afternoon for a while, maybe during the working day and the epidemic, the environment is quiet and relaxed, and the service is very warm, making people feel very comfortable. Thank you for the wonderful stay experience these days.

Let's talk about the advantages first: the hotel is relatively new, the room facilities are good, the floor is high, the view is good, the breakfast is rich, the Li'an restaurant is worth a visit, and the Black Pearl lives up to its name. The surrounding business is prosperous and the transportation is convenient, so families can travel without renting a car. The hotel staff are enthusiastic and enthusiastic, and Yuan Feng from the housekeeping depar**ent is considerate and attentive, which improved our living experience.
As for the inadequacies: First of all, we booked the deluxe suite with China Unicom Executive Double, and found that the two rooms could not be connected when we arrived at the store, so we slept in an extra bed in the living room for three nights😭😭, of course, our extra bed fee was confiscated. Secondly, the construction site next door is in the peak period of construction, and there is a little noise. Finally, the swimming pool is too small, you can play in the water, but swimming is more embarrassing.

msg:Ctrip package, stay in a suite for one night. The hotel service is confirmed before the check-in at the front desk. Every link is meticulous and in place. The service staff are well-trained, courteous, and flexible in handling things, which is comfortable and satisfying. The space layout of the suite reflects a sense of luxury. The room is very clean, and the objects are placed in a simple and well-organized manner. It feels the texture of Hilton's high-end brand. It is especially worth mentioning that the large window in the bedroom has a wide field of vision and a sense of openness. The interior is fully brewed with a sense of warmth. Unfortunately, the rainy weather can only leave hazy exterior photos. The Chinese restaurant Li'an's lunch set is amazing and worth a try.

I called the day before check-in to ask for special requests, and the requirements for room arrangement and early check-in were also Satisfied. Great experience.
The location of the hotel is great. The elevator goes directly downstairs to Fushi. It is just a few steps away from the Vientiane City. At the same time, the scenery of the 45th floor high-rise building is also very feast for the eyes. If you have a small appetite for afternoon tea and happy hour in the evening, you can go directly to the hotel. For dinner, the breakfast on the second day is very rich, and I will choose Conrad next time I come to Hangzhou.

From the underground garage up to the first floor, the bellman gave a cold right hand and said that he checked in in the lobby on the 27th floor. After arriving in the lobby, the front desk reception is even colder and there is no smile. Do you not need to train before you get on the job? Is the feature of your service to show the guests their faces? When I checked in, I asked whose name I ordered. Do you have any toiletries? Didn't tell which floor the breakfast is on, and what time is it? Don’t ask if the guest is coming by car? I came back from dinner in the evening and saw a waiter at the elevator entrance on the 27th floor. By the way, I asked where the breakfast was eaten. What time did it end? Tell me as much as possible until 11 o'clock. 🤪It's actually until 10 o'clock. When I arrived in the room, I found that the curtains were manually closed for such a large window. There was no shower cap in the toiletries. I knew that there were female guests who didn't bring them here. We ordered a package from Little Bear, and I didn’t see it in the room. I asked the front desk when I checked out later. The waiter in the breakfast room is not very skilled, but the attitude is very good. In short, this stay was super uncomfortable, which greatly reduced the brand image. Management really needs to be improved.

Disadvantages are: 1. The biggest point, the bathroom is really too small, and it has to be divided into three parts. It is the first time I have encountered such a depressing bathroom, which is so small that it is inserted in such a small space. A bathtub, mixed with a shower, and a toilet next to it, I really dare not design it like this at home.
2. I stayed at West Lake State Guest House the day before, compared to the service is really cold, the attitude of the front desk is really bad. The two waitresses in the executive lounge worthy of praise are the service attitude that Conrad should have.
3. Such a big window is not an electric curtain. I have been tired for a day. I have to pull it back by hand before going to bed at night. It really makes me tired.
It's no wonder that some people say this is just a hotel outside of gold and jade. After coming to Hangzhou, I will not consider making a decision again.

First of all, the little brothers and sisters at the front desk have a good service attitude, and they are natural and friendly in conversation and manners. I care about these, so the goodwill is up. The hotel is newly built, and the environmental facilities and sanitary conditions are basically not to be selected. , The scenery is good, probably because of the new district, the night view is actually good, quite satisfactory, no breakfast in the hotel, no evaluation, the hotel details are good, the mattress is comfortable, the pillows are average, and the overall value for money is recommended!

msg:In fact, I have been longing for the Conrad Hangzhou for a long time. Although this stay met the rainy season in the south of the Yangtze River, I also experienced a vague beauty in the mist and rain. The hotel is very close to the exit of Jiangjin Road Station of Metro Line 4. The lobby is on the 27th floor. I arrived at the hotel at 12:30 noon. Due to the heavy rain, I didn’t want to go out. I thought I had to wait for the room, but told me that I could check in immediately. Informed the general suite downstairs that there may be activities that night, but after the actual check-in, I felt that the soundproofing of the hotel was really good, and there was almost no noise. Due to the characteristics of the overall structure of Raffles City, the layout of the rooms is a bit awkward. The central area is too empty and the space is a bit wasted. In addition, you may feel that the original LCD TV looks small. The afternoon tea in the executive lounge on the 36th floor is quite exquisite, but it is sweeter. In the evening, HH is a la carte system. Because I wanted to go to Li'an to experience it, I didn’t go, but I looked at the menu and felt that it’s for a single guest. Or a girl with a small appetite is very friendly, enough to eat. Li'an Chinese Restaurant is exquisite in both the environment and the dishes, and there are many innovations in the taste, but the price is still quite high.

Because it was a temporary decision to travel, I would like to thank Jone xu, the front desk brother who checked in this time. He was very patient and carefully introduced various room types. For us, including The demand for extra bed is also arranged in time, and I would like to express my satisfaction and thank you. The hotel software is very good, the service is also good, but the hardware needs to be improved, the room Wi-Fi is difficult to connect, the underground garage is unclear, and the breakfast Chinese style is not rich enough.

客房可以俯瞰錢江大橋，樓下是國際會議中心，杭州大劇院，市民中心，可以遙望錢江對岸的奧體中心，碰巧今晚張傑在奧體開演唱會。

預訂後客户經理Lucky Jane全程服務，入住前一天會電話聯繫住客，詢問對房間的要求，然後會發送停車指引訊息。入住後將車牌報給服務人員就可以在入住期間自由進出停車場了。入住有歡迎卡和水果，晚間有小點心。總的來説服務還是很到位的。

然後退房前台跟我説不續住要跟攜程告知，不然會扣費，因為我訂到明天我説你看看我訂單，手機給她看，她説哦我們搞錯了

趕高峯來杭州遊玩確實不明智，但是選住杭州康萊德絕對是很明智的選擇！
在這麼多人流的杭州，我在康萊德找到了一方靜土
早上休閑的吃一頓早餐，晚上回來舒適的遊個泳，做個spa，巴適得很！
這裏不得不提一下康萊德服務，尤其是禮賓部的小哥Chria，一個暖心小哥哥，人不但帥，還特別貼心，帶了小朋友出行，小朋友想要個康萊德小熊，小哥哥很快就送上來了，還給我們提供了很多旅遊攻略tips，住了很多酒店，感覺這裏的服務一級棒👍，推薦大家來杭州就選康萊德，服務找chria，啥也不用擔心，他們都會幫你安排好！！！尤其是帶小童出行👍

It takes more than half an hour to take a taxi from the airport. The business is very good. The waiters seem to be too busy. The rooms are very small and quite satisfactory. There are no free items in the minibar , In fact, I can't drink much. I haven't experienced the butler service. After adding the WeChat at the front desk, the reply is very slow. The experience is very average. The breakfast is also quite satisfactory, and the service is also average.

msg:入住體驗為零分實在不愉快。希望康萊德酒店懂法律瞭解一下表見代理。
門口有一羣人假扮康萊德的代客泊車，收取100元泊車費，如果是酒店的正規服務也無可厚非，於是我就讓他幫我停車了，他説可以幫我把鑰匙送上樓or放在一樓禮賓，我和他説泊車費記我房費裏，但是他支支吾吾説不是一個康萊德系統什麼的，然後讓我單獨發紅包給他，我説為什麼我不是付給你們公司而是給你個人，他説他收了就交給公司。此時我才意識到該泊車不是康萊德，我心裏一陣發毛，因為對方有我的酒店房間號。
問了酒店的人説康萊德沒有代客泊車服務，我這時已經很生氣了，首先我不知道我的車到底安不安全，這個幫我停車的人到底是誰，其次我不知道如果我的車有問題，到底是誰負責對我進行賠償，他們是否具備賠償的能力（是否有商業保險）。後來我和那個停車的人説你們這樣是違法的，然後他囉裏八嗦一大堆，其實我是很不想給他錢的，但是此時我已經把我所有訊息（姓，手機號，房間號）都給他了，我不想冒我自己的人身風險以及我車被動手腳的風險和他糾纏。此事我向當晚值班經理反應，值班經理表態大概就是：1. 他不知道有人冒充酒店幫客人停車，這個事情和他們無關。2. 他會和隔壁餐廳或者物業的人溝通，然後我問他要不要這個幫我停車的人的微信，他説不需要因為他不會去找單獨這個人溝通，我説你難道不需要他們領導是誰在幹這個事情，他沒有回話。難道康萊德默許了代客泊車？背後有利益分割？
總之這是一次非常非常糟糕的入住體驗。如果這個事情是發生在一晚2、300的快捷酒店，我覺得很正常，因為我不可能讓快捷酒店的人幫我停車，但這是希爾頓旗下的知名品牌康萊德酒店，發生了這種類似一大堆黃牛擠在酒店門口騙別人代客泊車，康萊德酒店負主要責任。首先，康萊德酒店沒有任何人員去保持自己酒店門口的秩序，去維護自己客人的合法權益，我在你們酒店正門口把我的車和鑰匙交給了一個冒充你們酒店的代客泊車的人，（為什麼我很堅信他就是酒店的人，原因就是1. 他站在酒店的正門口，停車用着酒店門口的地盤。沒有任何人驅趕他或者妨礙他假裝成酒店的人幫客人停車。2. 我開到門口我就問他住店停哪裡，他就説他可以代客泊車，然後等我下車了才説要收100元。3. 他義正嚴辭的説可以幫我把車鑰匙送上來，而且入住期間都可以享受代客泊車服務）。其次，你們的內部培訓我已經看出來簡直就是一盤散沙，當晚的值班經理處理事情的態度和説話方式非常不專業，康萊德這個品牌我一輩子都不會再住了，是我住過所有酒店裡最差的（不是五星級所有，是這輩子所有）。

msg:國慶價格基本差不多，康萊德比柏悦便宜500，對比柏悦1.2米的雙床，還是以舒適性為主選了康萊德，它們的雙床都是1.5米，睡倆人都沒問題。
對比大多數人説的幾個問題：
1. 行李生無服務？
其實還好，抵達的時候有行李生接行李和引導按電梯，出門打車時也會開拉車門，偶爾有些顧不上，感覺也沒啥。但是27樓的服務生就有點不靈，按不按電梯估計看心情。
2. 入住辦理時間等待過長？
還行。3點到的，我前面約有7個人在排隊，但是3個枱麪在處理，速度還是比較快，大約15分鐘左右輪到我。酒廊辦也需要排隊，所以別掙扎了。辦理入住的是一個鐵T（沒有不禮貌的意思，忘記叫啥了），沒什麼微笑但是勝在速度快，房間沒有整理出來建議我去行政酒廊下午茶等候。酒廊等候約莫一個小時，剛好來幾局遊戲，總之還行。
3. 房間很小？柱子有影響？
還行吧。如果你住過廣州四季，也有柱子，我有個租出去的房子中間也有柱子，而且這柱子比較靠邊，還行吧。房間總體還是很寬紹的，對我來説足夠了。衞生間是真的迷你，淋浴和洗浴不分開，洗手枱真的太窄了，啥也放不下，這點不行。
備品是百瑞德，身體乳一股口水味，不靈。
風景的話，錢江黃泥水的江景還是可以的，除了隔壁爛尾樓有點煞風景，總體還是美。
4. 早餐要排隊？
基本不會。第一天8點半下去排隊了5分鐘，後面兩天都沒有排隊，但三天早餐都一樣。
5. 行政酒廊沒什麼可吃的？
不會。我們去的三天都是半自助，不是點單。東西雖然不多，但是雞、魚、肉、炒飯、水果、甜品都有，晚餐不怎麼吃飯的我非常OK了！！！白葡萄酒可以，兩款都可，一款柑橘偏脆口感、另一款花香柔和。尤其是酒廊的Irene特別貼心，特別送我小熊，第二天還往房間送了巧克力點心，小朋友超級喜歡。
6. 網紅PAO樓？
至少我那幾天沒有看到過網紅，可能過氣了吧。樓下五分鐘萬象城，好吃的。

唯一要吐槽的點，因為萬豪大使平常不住希爾頓，所以提前打電話問是否可以晚1小時退房，便於等飛機。左磨右賴，感覺佔了多大便宜似的，雖然最後同意了，但非常勉強。對比同樣不是會員的廣州柏悦，還特意打電話到房間説延遲到下午4點退房（那會兒還是春節期間）還送兩瓶酒，所以是真的小氣。

msg:康萊德，是我去到一座城市首選的酒店品牌，住就對了，水平有保證。體驗過廣州康萊德（住了20次，每次2-3天），馬爾代夫康萊德（住了2次，每次4天）

不過杭州康萊德整體是讓我失望的，希望酒店運營方如果看到這條旅客反饋可以好好思考一下改進措施。

先説背景吧：在杭州康萊德住過兩次，第一次是22年國慶9.30-10.5，住的行政房；第二次是23年3.10-3.12，普通房。

失望原因：
1. 一樓大堂處無工作人員迎賓幫忙提行李？入口櫃枱處的小哥或小姐姐永遠對着自己的電腦or文件，不會抬頭對進出旅客打任何招呼Say Hello？講真，我是一個不想麻煩人的旅客，能自己提的行李不會麻煩別人，但貴酒店迎賓的“歡迎感”完全沒感受到；
2. 前台的小姐姐們也同樣完全沒有讓我感受到“服務的熱情”，溝通語調僵硬。説真的前台是每位旅客辦理入住的“必經之路”，也完全沒有感受到被Welcome，感受不到我住的是豪華酒店，又被貴酒店Respect
3. 酒店房間設施感覺很一般，沒有豪華感，尤其是這個價位的酒店，窗簾是手動的；電視很感覺很久，尤其是遙控器，感覺是上個世紀的產物；
4. 去8樓泳池游泳，救生員主動告訴我游泳姿勢不對，然後教我一些技巧，原本還蠻開心的，後來説著説著竟然向我推銷辦游泳卡？這生意做的… 而且泳池浴室沒有掛衣服的地方，很不方便
5. 最感到不滿意的是“早餐竟然要排隊”，國內外的豪華酒店住了許多，第一次遇見，也許是因為生意太好了？在我看來，“等待或排隊”是不應該發生在貴酒店的事情，如果真的餐廳位置不夠，是否應該通過佈局調整增加座椅餐位？而不是讓住客排隊，這直接體現的是酒店管理水平以及是否真的考慮旅客體驗。所以我果斷放棄酒店早餐即使付過錢，而直接去點外賣。然後從我放棄排隊到下樓拿外賣大概40分鐘，依然在排隊，大體時間是8:20-9:00。

最後表揚一下吧：貴酒店行政酒廊服務不錯，這是我唯一感到滿意的地方。22年國慶在行政酒廊用餐或休憩，整體服務很滿意，那裡的小姐姐很熱情，與前台和一樓迎賓相比感覺好了好幾個級別。

説了許多，都是個人體驗，希望對貴酒店有所幫助，能持續改進。

msg:第一次住服務那麼差的康萊德，實在對得起五星級嗎？！首先在下車的時候，行李生看到我們拿着行李，非常冷漠，既不打招呼也沒笑容，更別説幫我們拿行李了。其二，外賣不能送到房間這件事情就很扯，説是食品安全問題，但很多酒店可以簽一個免責協議就可以給客人送到房間，一個五星級酒店還要客人轉兩道電梯到一樓外賣櫃取餐，贊爆了！！其三，2月13日晚大概9、10點的，守着27樓通往客房的電梯的那個工作人員公然上班打遊戲，還是吃雞！不能更讚了這家五星級酒店的管理！！管理層可以被炒掉了！

msg:酒店所處的位置，視野都不用説 極佳，硬件方面除了我住的房間淋浴頭水壓不夠高以外都沒有任何問題。
      主要講講前台的服務人員吧，彷彿不是來服務，是來氣人的，元宵當天辦入住，被告知需要半個小時才能拿到房間，40分鐘後我來到前台，被告知仍需要15-20分鐘才可以去房間，我走了以後，後面一位先生跟前台説 自己上午就來了，當時的前台跟他説最遲三點就能拿到房間了，怎麼現在還沒有。然後前台竟然跟這位先生爭起來了，先生説你們説的最遲三點，前台來來回回一句話不可能，沒説過，絕對不可能，我驚呆了。
又過了40分鐘我才拿到房間，我跟前台説你一開始説半小時結果都快一個半小時了，那人竟然理都不帶理我的？？這就是希爾頓的服務態度嗎？人多等的久我能理解，但這樣的服務態度，這樣的瞎説大概時間真的好嗎？
無獨有偶，第二天下午上樓發現房卡用不了了，我昨天特地強調跟前台説我是住兩晚的分了兩個訂單，結果衹給我做了一天的房卡，我將此事跟今天的前台説，前台衹説正常兩個字。我又驚呆了，第一，難道兩個訂單的同一房型你們技術不支持做兩晚房間？第二，就算你們有顧慮，我從昨天等了80分鐘到今天上不去樓，我從來沒有聽到過一句抱歉之類的話。真的太離譜了。服務態度是我這麼多酒店住下來最差的一家！極差！！！

認為不合理有3點：一.我沒有要求需要洗衣服務，為什麼工作人員要每個房間都敲門按門鈴？房間內也沒有配備需要洗衣服務的掛牌；二.收取衣服的工作人員的着裝比較偏向便服的款式，讓人覺得不像是酒店工作人員，加上如此急促地敲門和按鈴，讓人感覺會是不法分子；3.在沒有要求洗衣服務的前提下，服務員敲門和按門鈴沒人響應後，為什麼可以主動刷卡自行進入房間？如果我們正好在睡覺又沒穿衣服，你們怎麼負責？如果有小孩看到你們突然進來了，被嚇到了，你們又怎麼負責？

更生氣的是，退房當天説spa不能在前台開發票，我趕飛機就讓他聯繫spa開完發到我郵箱。結果等了一週還沒收到！前兩天又打了酒店前台電話催要發票，還是不給！今天我自己搜spa電話打過去，spa告知發票早就開好了，就是酒店不發給我，你們啥意思？客人走了就不服務了嗎？電話記錄和微信記錄我都有，我要是閑的慌真心想給希爾頓酒店集團投訴一把！

從叫了份外賣到酒店，由於外賣員送錯了。請工作人員協助溝通，他們説這和他們沒關係。

7月5號入住，6號離店，一直沒退按金。我之前從來不查按金退的問題，因為一直沒發生過，這次正好要整理賬目，核對到按金未退。打電話過去之後，按金退了，工作人員狡辯是退房當天就退了按金，由於銀行問題未到賬。

總之，酒店價格和就服務完全不對等，大堂人員説話含糊不清而且做事亂，辦理入住和退房時都需要等很久 。

好評的原因主要是因為袁鳳阿姨，我走的時候遺忘了一塊手錶她立刻讓前台打電話給我並且一直守在門口等我來，我説要給小費她也不接受就僅僅想讓我給個好評，這樣為公司着想的阿姨我非常希望酒店能注意到，為其他員工也可以做個好的榜樣。

第二，號稱五星級酒店，沒有開夜床服務，衹是進來送了一份歡迎水果。
第三，衞生間和床頭有煙味，未做好無煙處理。
第四，也是體驗感最差的一點，我帶着孩子出門，在門口跟服務生説請幫我叫一輛車租車，該服務生回答：“我沒有這項服務，你自己叫車”
我問：酒店沒有叫車服務的嗎？他説那你問酒店！他就毫無服務意識，且態度很差。説的自己就不是酒店員工似的。
我知道現在國內各種軟件很發達很好用，但我長期不在國內生活手機裏沒有叫車軟件，也搞不清楚從付款寶裏怎麼樣才能叫專車，其實他完全可以指導我一下。
後來還是另一服務生教我的，其實就是舉手之勞，但會讓我感到比較貼心。

總結，第一次入住，應該也是最後一次！

因為喜歡北京的康萊德，所以這次來杭州選擇了康萊德，但是服務差距不要太大吧？
下車之後1樓的酒店工作人員直接無視我，不幫忙提行李就算了，在我看向他的時候直接轉身就走？
27樓電梯口有個工作人員/保安，在我入住期間沒有打過一次招呼，一次問好，我以為可能就是不説話的？直到我check out那天，發現電梯口的工作人員和我前面的女士問好，我才發現啊原來是會主動問好的。
早上六點離開酒店，衹有我一個客人拎着箱子；兩名工作人員都沒有上前幫忙。

這麼多工作人員就在那裡幹站着，一點都不幫忙，甚至開口一句問號都不會。也真是絕了

設施：面積與周邊快捷酒店相當，不過多了一個壞的智能馬桶。

環境：零點之後，一樓大廳坐着一羣男子，搭訕對象是站電梯口不按電梯的女子。

msg:今年除了帝都呆的最久的地方就是杭州了前後我估摸得有一個月了，從白天到夜晚到哪裡都很美不愧是我第二喜歡的城市

康萊德呀挨着錢塘江的環境很好的地方，位置很棒交通也很方便值得一去入住的，周圍就是來福士商場吃的也很多離着地鐵站也不遠性價比很高，早餐非常好吃特別靠譜的地方給你們安利一波。

ps：值班經理趙帥和一個叫徐萍的姑娘都非常好

msg:做為希爾頓旗下的高端品牌，這次入住的整體感覺一般。首先大堂登記的時候前台工作人員任由他人插隊，對後面排隊等候的顧客造成很大影響。下午4:00到酒店，我訂的兩間房還沒有準備好，折騰了一個多小時才就緒。我帶的兩位80多歲的長者就衹能乾等。旅遊旺季我能理解，但是酒店是不是應該提前在人力，資源方面進行準備？
