May Day is more and more.
There are no seats during happy hour. The suites are all full. The first time you check out of the executive floor is at 1 o'clock. The lobby is full of running children.
It's suffocating.
However, the service at the lounge front desk, the room and the breakfast are as satisfactory as always. Great.
I hope the business will not be so prosperous anymore. Haha.

I was exhausted from the journey, so I put my luggage away after checking in. I chose a river view room, where I could see houses and mountains in the distance.
The room was clean and tidy. There was no comb in the room, so I asked the hotel to deliver it. Now it is delivered by smart robots, which is quite fun.
The hotel also sent welcome fruits, and you can go for a walk by the river at night.

msg:During the post-holiday off-season, there was not much passenger flow, it was deserted, the service was not enthusiastic enough, and the lobby staff gathered together to chat. 1. The original vehicle entrance of the hotel was blocked and was changed to a side entrance with no obvious sign. As a result, taxis were unable to find the entrance and were unable to enter or park outside. Guests were required to walk off the road. 2. If a friend comes to pick him up by car and it takes more than half an hour to leave the gate, he will be charged. The employee stepped forward and clearly indicated that he was a hotel guest. The employee only expressed the need to go to the front desk to scan the QR code and did not take any further service action. He should contact the guest to confirm the license plate and release it. There was no second car on the scene and it was not busy at all. 3. There is a welcome letter and folded towel at the end of the bed in the room, but fake flowers are used. Instantly lowered the brand image and value. There was no welcome fruit either. I originally wanted to stay one more day, but found that I had no satisfactory reason and had to change hotels.

To the north of the hotel is the riverside landscape belt, and the Oujiang River has beautiful scenery. At night, you can enjoy the large mountain light show on the opposite bank; The hotel meets Marriott's consistent standards, and the hardware facilities are online. Marriott, who has stayed in many cities across the country, is deeply impressed by the breakfast at this hotel. It has a rich variety and several authentic Wenzhou specialty snacks. I like it.

msg:I took my children to stay in a hotel during the National Day and treated it as a vacation. The location of the hotel is very good. I booked an executive river view room, Oujiang River, cruise ships, and mountain light show. You can have an unobstructed view from the room. You can go downstairs to visit the night market on Oujiang Road.
The executive benefits include coffee, snacks, fruit drinks from morning to night, light meals for dinner, and a cocktail after the meal to spend a relaxing and enjoyable day. Daisy from M Club has a sweet and caring smile, which also made us feel the quality of Marriott's hardware and software.

msg:This time I came to Wenzhou Marriott Hotel. The hotel was very busy during the Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day, but when I came to this hotel, I had a very good experience during my stay. Although the hotel was full, they also helped me reserve a room and room type in advance. We also made an upgrade. When Winston, the front desk manager, learned that I was traveling with my elderly family, he thoughtfully gave me an extra breakfast and a booklet (similar to a travel guide) about the "Asian Games" with detailed records. I also received recommendations for food and attractions, which undoubtedly added luster to my entire trip. My experience during my stay was also very good, whether it was the attentive service that Winston brought to me at the front desk or the comfortable experience in the guest rooms. , let me really remember it in my heart. If I come to Wenzhou again next time, Wenzhou Marriott will definitely be the best choice!

msg:The service from the service staff of this Marriott hotel was a bit poor. The weather was fine when I went out on the second day after I checked in. However, I checked the weather forecast and it said it would rain. So I went to the front desk to borrow an umbrella. As a result, a senior waiter at the front desk said there was an umbrella in the room. We refused to borrow an umbrella, so we asked other staff for help, but the senior waiter blocked the service for the same reason. The reason why I still give it 4 stars is because one rat excrement cannot represent the overall level.

One thing that needs improvement is that the hotel elevator requires swiping a card, but only one room card is given. When traveling as a family, it is very inconvenient if the family does not enter and exit together. You also need to ask the waiter to help open the elevator. I took the card and went out, but the power in the room was cut off, the window was sealed and could not be opened, and the door to the room could not be kept open. My husband said in the room that it was too stuffy😂

There is a constant-temperature shallow water area for children. The water temperature is relatively high and is close to the hot springs. The kids had a lot of fun here. I went to the executive lounge for snacks in the afternoon, but I didn't experience it in the evening, so it should be good. I was very satisfied with the breakfast, especially the Wenzhou glutinous rice. I wanted to eat it after a bowl, but unfortunately the glutinous rice was gone and the new one was still steaming. I gave up after waiting for 20 minutes before I could wait. The shortcomings are that the hygiene in the details has not been done well, and the air in the room is not good, there is a peculiar smell, it should be the residual smoke smell, my nose and throat are sensitive, which makes me a little uncomfortable.

There are tea residues left in the kettle. I washed it no less than 7.8 times before washing it clean. Secondly, there are 2 pinches of hair in the bathroom and shower room. It’s too disgusting to post pictures. The most incomprehensible thing is that the refrigerator is locked🤔It is said that if you want to use the refrigerator, you have to apply to the hotel to unlock it😢Is this treating the hotel guests as thieves😳Or the hotel guests can’t drink the Coke Sprite in the refrigerator? It’s too uncoordinated for such a petty hotel in such a grand hotel. Normally there are 2 red tea bags and 2 green tea bags, but Marriott’s is good. Come with 3 bags. Do you need to be so stingy?

msg:Very dissatisfied! The hotel is very new, the hardware is good, but the service has not kept up at all, let me talk about what I encountered
1. It is understandable that there are many people when checking in, but there is no one in the hotel to maintain the order. The three front desks are all surrounded, and no one cares if someone jumps in the line. Not to mention taking the initiative to care for and deliver tea and the like.
2. When checking in, the front desk directly said that the room was not cleaned well, and it would take ten minutes. Let me ask, are you sure you need me to wait? Then there is a room right away. Speechless 😒
3. The hotel has locked all the external windows to ensure the safety of guests. Laughed to death, the first time I saw such a hotel.
4. I ordered takeaway at noon the next day, and when the deliveryman delivered it, the receptionist in the lobby actually told the deliveryman that I should call the front desk and report to the front desk before using the robot to deliver the food. This attitude is not flattering. After I arrived in the lobby, during the negotiation with the hotel, takeaways were delivered continuously, and they were placed directly on the takeaway table, and the hotel also delivered them. The naked double standard is comparable to the recent BMW mini ice cream incident.
5. During the take-out period, a lady surnamed * who claimed to be a manager in the hotel lobby came to coordinate and solve the problem, but she could not issue a business card or ID card to prove her identity as a manager. I think she was deceiving. A man appeared behind and said it was surnamed * Girls don't have a business card and forgot to bring their badges, so they can provide information from the hotel's personnel system, speechless!
  The above is the experience during the stay in the hotel. I think the hotel has serious service problems. The service concept is backward. This hotel is not recommended yet.
The picture is the takeaway I ordered. I didn’t eat it, and I wasn’t in the mood to eat it. I left it for the hotel as a souvenir!

msg:Wenzhou Marriott is still as warm and comfortable as ever. The facilities and hardware are excellent, and the service is reliable. These are important considerations for my preferred choice. Wenzhou Marriott is our first stay. When we approached the lobby, we felt the warm and thoughtful concierge service. The check-in at the front desk was very patient and meticulous, making check-in fast and comfortable. The service in the executive lounge is also very considerate, and the personalized requirements of the guests are always available. In particular, David at the front desk is always smiling, polite and considerate, making people feel at home. The hotel's gym and swimming pool experience is also great. I especially recommend his buffet breakfast, which is super cost-effective and the dishes are amazing! Overall, it is a very recommendable store.

The executive room is very good, arranged on the sub-top floor, and the hotel provides an all-day executive lounge during holidays! Very thoughtful, the breakfast on the first floor is more abundant! I still recommend everyone to go to the first floor for breakfast, where there are local specialties! A very pleasant experience!

It is very convenient to have underground parking, and there is surveillance at the door, which is very reassuring. The lobby is well laid out and has light music, which is very nice. The service provided by the front desk manager, Winston, is great. He is enthusiastic, proactive, efficient, considerate, and professional. When I checked out today, he wished me a happy Mid-Autumn Festival. The room is well-lit, bright, quiet, comfortable, very clean, and the mattress is comfortable. The water comes out quickly, the water temperature is good and comfortable for bathing, the Internet speed is fast, and it is convenient for working. The room is neat and tidy, the guest room aunt is kind, the service is good, quick and thoughtful. Very good, highly recommended!

Epidemic ⚠️Hotels are strict with big data itinerary codes. If there is a case area, as long as a city green code also needs nucleic acid, there will be a special person during the day. Strict inspection at the door. There is an emergency hospital of Chinese and Western medicine nearby. I made a special report in 5 hours at the request of the hotel.
⚠️Note that the hotel minibar does not have any alcoholic beverages. There are two free bottles of drinking water. The service phone does not provide beer, etc.
Washing and other disposable supplies In addition to shower gel, shampoo, conditioner. All individually packaged. There are soap and hand sanitizer for more details. It’s just shampoo, conditioner, shower gel and bottled. It’s the first time I met in a hotel. It’s a bit lowered. The desk is not a business desk.

🍃Environment: The Nanxi River is nice outside the window. But building is under construction all around🚧
🚗 Transportation: It is more convenient to take a taxi. Don't be too late, it will be difficult to call a car
The hotel manager's service attitude is very good👍
Overall good. Tingri is newly opened here, there are many star-rated hotels, the price is slightly higher, about 700

msg:The service is very good, and they always respond to requests. They also call back for follow-up visits.
Advantages: 1: The buffet is good, I bought a dinner coupon,
            Free breakfast is also good. Book a room with breakfast.
             It's past 10 o'clock,
              2: The swimming pool is nice, constant temperature, and very clean.
              3: There are quite a lot of parking spaces, which is convenient.
Okay, now let’s talk about the shortcomings:
                1: Make a public place for body wash and shampoo. You can still use it during the epidemic.
                    What kind of thing, the experience is not good,
                 2: The sound insulation is average. I heard the loud boss’s head early in the morning.
                    Talking at the door and passing by, I woke up from sleep in an instant,
                   3: Here’s the key point. The shower room on the 20th floor has hot water and cold water for a while. My daughter is only six years old. She caught a cold before going to bed after taking a bath. It’s fine for adults. It’s not suitable for children. There is no discomfort for adults after taking a bath. Children can't stand the alternation of cold and heat. A cold caused sinusitis and cough. They went home and were taken to the hospital for a week and they still haven't recovered. If you are bringing a child, it is recommended to bring a bathtub bag and put water in the bathtub to wash it.
               4: I don’t know what’s wrong with the bathroom. I always feel that the pipes smell bad, but it’s still acceptable.
In summary, the service is warm and worthy of praise. The hardware needs to be improved. It is recommended to stay.

The facilities in this Marriott's room are very general, and some details are not in place. There are friends. Arrived first, I checked in later. It should be David who helped me check in (I only took a cursory glance, if I remember correctly), the little gift given to me was a cute doll, and the service attitude was very good. Customers are also very talkative. Except for David, the services of other people are relatively average, and there is not much contact. In the same level hotel, I may prefer the service of Intercontinental. Maybe Marriott is a large group, so other expenses are relatively high. Compared with the newly emerging art hotels in other first-tier cities, this facility is relatively ordinary. For breakfast, I overslept and didn't eat at all. The room is just like the picture. No accidents, no pictures.

酒店的服務設施齊全。健身房是24小時開門的，各種設備都齊全，還有自由桿👍，游泳池也是營業到23點，很方便。

入住前來電詳細詢問了我們的入住時間和詳細需求，很貼心，下次來温州還會考慮住這裏。

msg:酒店比較新，住客很多，江景夜景不錯。需要吐槽的是剛入住就有街道辦人員打電話要求加微信提供所有行程資料，而且很不客氣，似乎來温州的都是嫌犯，這些入住時已經提供過一次給前台的。讓我對温州好感全無，衹想盡快離開。

msg:本人其實很少來點評酒店，住過好幾個城市的萬豪集團的酒店，從萬豪到旗下的雅樂軒都有，這家温州萬豪算是比較差的一次居住體驗。以下四點，
1、酒店配備的嬰兒床，設計有缺陷，床墊是懸空掛在那裡，相當於吊牀的樣子，孩子在上面翻個身都是非常大的連鎖反應，8個月大的孩子直接就爆哭，着實也是被自己嚇到了；
2、酒店的空調，我覺得是不是這款智能是新出的，當室內温度達到設定温度時，空調自動停止工作，一點風都沒有，後面就要手動開啟，調節温度，明明室內的温度已經上來了。
3、空調出風角度固定，就是照着床上吹，直吹我的腦門，早上睡醒，孩子已經流鼻涕了，我也開始喉嚨幹疼。
4、我是萬豪會員，雖説不是很高等級的會員，但是入住當天，恰逢是我的生日，但是酒店無任何反應，哪怕一句生日快樂的祝福都沒有。我當天剛從泉州的洲際酒店退房，退房那刻，酒店送上了茶包和祝福。兩個酒店對比，高下立判！
至此，温州萬豪，再也不會入住這個酒店！
