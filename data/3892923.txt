The room was clean and the beds were comfortable. We enjoyed using the workout room and the pool, which is free for guests. There were several restaurants and coffee shops close by, within walking distance, including Starbucks. The hotel was close to the subway station.

msg:This hotel exceeded my expectations. I booked the hotel for its proximity to Sanda University. The first few days we had to stay inside because of the typhoon but luckily it has an indoor pool, tv to watch the Olympics or even HBO, a spa, gym, and a few games downstairs in a small play area. There are 2 restaurants inside plus it’s very near many small stores and restaurants for your convenience. They had a resident artist on site during my stay. The hotel manager on duty and in the restaurant were very personable. Check in and out went smooth. My room was very comfortable and kept clean. Laundry service came by to check if I needed my clothes tended to and cleaning management also stopped by to see if my room had been cleaned properly.

It improved my hotel experience. From then on, I knew what it meant to stay in a hotel. I was hooked. Wanda, Sheraton, Hilton, MGM, all arranged 😂😂😂. What 7 Days Inn did I stay in before? What Hanting? Home Inn, that was basically just a place to sleep, no experience at all. Since I stayed in this hotel, I like business trips. Highly recommended. The overall feeling is great. 👍👍👍

msg:Definitely not a five-star hotel. The security guard at the door did nothing. The overall hygiene was very poor. Both the room and the public area were very dirty. I asked the aunt to come and clean it again. She was also sloppy. The waiter even put a quilt on her. I have to go to a designated place in the bedroom to set it up, I have to open the door after I closed it, and I still have to close it when I leave. Shouldn't the service be based on the guest's request? Are you a five-star hotel or a guest house?
The only thing is that the service attitude is good, but unfortunately the workmanship is really poor.
There are many varieties of breakfast, but none of them are delicious. I heard from the waiter that this kind of presidential suite can accommodate many people, so I can only say that I think it is suitable for a large group of people to come for team building and for families like us to come and play. Especially since I like to be clean, I don’t recommend it.

The office area is large enough and has a coffee machine. One coffee capsule is provided. 4 bottles of water, minibar is not free. The bed is a bit soft, the quilt is of appropriate thickness, the shower room is huge, and the toiletries are average. The TV cannot be adjusted if it is not facing the bed. The breakfast was quite satisfactory, with few pastries. When I checked out, I met the cleaning lady and greeted her warmly.

The room is large and there is a subway station next to it. The hotel is in a good location and has convenient transportation. There is the Line 9 subway nearby. It takes about 8 minutes to walk to the subway station. It is very convenient to travel to and from the city center. Check-in at the front desk was quick. Xiao Lin and Xiao Hou's service was very warm and friendly. There was free lemonade and juice in the lobby for guests to use. They were very considerate. The view on the 11th floor was really good. I like the high altitude when staying in a hotel. The floors and room facilities are complete. Some of the layout and details of the hotel are deliberately designed to reflect Shanghai elements, which makes people feel very good. The hotel rooms are clean and hygienic, very spacious, with large floor-to-ceiling windows. I stayed in a room facing the park with beautiful scenery. It's really relaxing. During the Chinese New Year, the hotel room staff I met were very attentive, considerate, and extremely polite. During the New Year, there were many staying guests setting off fireworks on the road outside. The Chinese New Year should be lively.

In terms of room facilities and environment, overall, the room I stayed in was hygienic and clean. The work was quite good. No stains or garbage were found. The environmental facilities can only be said to be average. I feel that it did not meet the five-star standard. It is more like a four-star hotel, but it is not bad. I can only say that if everyone is average It is okay to choose this hotel according to your needs, but if you want to experience luxurious and high-end facilities and environment, it is recommended to choose other five-star hotels. There should be many good choices for a price of almost one thousand. Then I ordered a few dishes from the Chinese restaurant in this hotel and ate in the room. The food in the Chinese restaurant was quite good. I was very satisfied with the dinner. I was also very satisfied with the service of the staff who came to deliver and collect the food.

When we got off the car and were still thinking about what to do, the staff at the door came forward to help After picking up the luggage, tell us that it is good for him to push it. The hotel lobby is not big but the decoration of the log style is warm and elegant. The front desk is not far from the gate. Before we even got to the front desk, the staff at the front desk have already raised their heads and said hello to us. The whole process While talking to us, she was very fast in her hands. Hahaha, the technique is very proficient at first glance. She introduced the breakfast, restaurant location, business hours, and gave us a welcome drink card. I was very surprised. The luggage was also helped. We delivered it to the room, and when we went in, we found welcome fruit. It was awesome. The room was very spacious for two people, and the hygiene was in place. We just met the room attendant in the corridor, who greeted us warmly, and we got extra points for our favorability. Tired, I ordered room delivery in the room. It is said that it is produced by the hotel's Chinese restaurant. It is delicious in color and fragrance. When it was delivered, it was kindly told that it would be good to call after eating. Now some hotels do not deliver food, and it is still a star The hotel is good. The gym and swimming pool are on the second floor, so I went shopping around, and there is also a Coca-Cola-themed check-in wall, excellent! The breakfast is rich in varieties, both Chinese and Western. I like the delicious little wontons. Powerlong Plaza is right next to it. The subway is also very close. It is very convenient. Parking is also free. There is also a park next to the hotel. The greenery is very good and it is suitable for walking. Really I like every point of the hotel. When we checked out, the front desk was kind enough to help us book a car. The time was just right. My friend and I only stayed for one day. I can't stop thinking about it. The service is considerate. I will come again next time!

The professional skills of the front desk staff checked in quickly. But on the floor of the big room, the aunt took the initiative to greet and told me to send me the baby's slippers and other supplies in a while. Also because I brought a baby, I specially sent a few more bottles of mineral water. I would like to thank Sister Han Li for her convenience and care.

msg:Let me start with the conclusion, ****.
Because my wife was going to take the bar exam, as hotel lovers, we chose a star-rated hotel closest to the exam site, but I regretted it. First of all, the premium suite was not closed. There were two doors in the room that were locked from the back. I didn't know where they were, and I didn't know if someone would suddenly open the door and come in. Then, for a room price of more than 1K, the soft drinks in the Mini Bar were actually charged. It was really unheard of, and it was too ugly to eat. Secondly, I don't know if the leaders of the housekeeping department or the front office department have ever lived in a premium suite near the street. The mud truck at 2:30 in the middle of the night seemed to be in gear in my mind, and the noise seemed to tell me that I was a big victim. Finally, I understand that the central air conditioner cannot cool in winter when it is turned on for heating, but can you change the quilt for me to be a little thinner when you turn on the heating? I was covered with that thick quilt, and my soul had already left my body. It was no longer considered sleeping. I was already cultivating immortals. It was hot. I told the housekeeping department to send me an electric fan in the middle of the night. It had some effect but not much, and it was still very noisy. In this way, my wife and I spent the last night before her exam almost without sleep.
The food at the hotel restaurant Shenge is quite good and reasonably priced.

When I checked in and checked out this time, I was suddenly informed that Shanghai implemented a new invoice policy, and their family had already used up the special tickets, so they couldn't open it. I communicated with them many times and told them clearly that my company needs a special paper ticket for reimbur*****t, but they still said they couldn't issue it. I was very puzzled, other hotels in Shanghai can issue special paper tickets, why it suddenly doesn’t work here. The explanation given by the service staff was that the special ticket was used up and there were no new ones, but it was obvious that they didn't want to go to the tax bureau to get a new invoice. If it is a company business trip, you need to issue a special paper ticket. It is recommended not to stay at this hotel.

We have two breakfasts➕late check-out, thank you very much, it saves me the trouble of buying breakfast early in the morning and having no place to go for my child's exam in the afternoon. The room is also very satisfactory, quiet and clean. The lady at the front desk I met when I checked out was also very nice. Since I paid in cash when I checked in, I also had to give me cash for the deposit part when I checked out. There are not many people who use cash now, so there is no change to give me. I wanted to go out and buy some change and come back. The young lady said no, she went to change it, and then called me to ask me to go to the front desk to pick it up. The front desk of this hotel is all angels. If my daughter’s classmates will also If you come here for an exam, you will definitely recommend staying here! 👍

The check-in experience was extremely poor. I stayed in an executive room. The room was so cold that I didn’t take a shower for fear of catching a cold. The carpet was large There is a lot of oil stains, the front desk changed rooms, the carpets in the rooms are all the same dirty, the water is the cheapest water less than one yuan, the breakfast is extremely simple, the dishes are only vegetables, I really don't know how to get good reviews and five stars

On the 15th floor, you can look at the Lujiazui three-piece suite. Opposite the hotel is the outer ring green space, with beautiful scenery and suitable for running. I personally test, the outer ring is about 1km a circle. Nearby residents live a life of idle clouds and wild cranes.

Service: Xiao Guo at the front desk can serve with a smile and solve problems at the same time. The front office manager is also very professional.

Facilities: basically perfect, equipment using batteries needs to be strengthened, such as weight scales, door locks.

The first choice to go to the Second Industrial University for the exam, 2 minutes away from the school, super close. The hotel is also very considerate, opening a restaurant for parents who have already checked out to rest. The only thing I was a little bit disappointed was that I didn't see the gifts prepared for candidates when I got to the room. My daughter was looking forward to it.

The service is not bad, the attitude is very good, the senior suite was booked, and the front desk took the initiative to upgrade the executive suite.
The next day I proposed to change to a quiet room, and the front desk manager actively coordinated and changed the room.

shortcoming:
Arrived on a rainy day and there was no doorman to take luggage. When taking a taxi, the security guard at the gate will not hold an umbrella to help open the door, but will just stand aside to hide from the rain.
I reported the above problems to the front desk of the hotel, but the girl at the reception didn't answer a word, so I had no choice but to ask someone else to report it, and was told that the girl had such a personality. . . . (Then why do you need to be in the service industry)
After the first night, I felt that the executive suite was next to the main road. After changing rooms, it was still next to the main road, and the sound of vehicles could still be heard at night. Both executive and senior suites are like this, I don't know how other room types are.
For breakfast the next day, after many staple foods were emptied, they could not be replenished in time.

Compared with Xingguo Radisson, both the environment and the service are two grades worse.

2 After finishing the work, I arrived to check in at around 12 o'clock in the evening. I was told that the reserved room was no longer available due to an arrangement error. I had to either accept another room or cancel the reservation. I'm really speechless. Is the service industry so *sexy now? Why should the guests bear the responsibility for the mistakes I made? Why didn't you inform me in advance if there was no room due to a mistake in the arrangement? If you ask me to cancel, will you let me sleep on the street at this time?
3 After struggling for an estimated 40 minutes, I arranged a room that was not as good as the reservation. It was so tiring.

The driving distance of more than 80 kilometers was really too fast at that time. Therefore, we chose Powerlong Radisson as the transfer station in the tour. The combination of Powerlong and Radisson did not disappoint us, and some even exceeded our expectations. Regarding the location of the hotel, there is a Powerlong commercial complex next to the hotel, which is more lively and has more choices of food and drink. Regarding the hotel, it is very convenient for the parking lot to be directly connected to the hotel building, and the front desk service is in place. When we came, we did not bring an ID card, and we used our electronic ID card to show our check-in card to complete the check-in. We saw that some of our children took the initiative to provide children's toiletries and slippers. In addition, when we saw that the 16th floor is a small playground, we gave us the elevator card on the 16th floor and reminded us that there are many people on holidays, and it is recommended to play later. We booked an executive room. There is a capsule coffee machine in the room, but there is no capsule coffee. We used the room's phone for one-button butler service, and we immediately brought capsule coffee. Later, we asked for the baby's bathrobe and razor. received. The hotel has a swimming pool, clean and medium in size, with a small surfing hot spring pool next to it. Babies have fun swimming and playing in the playground. It is worth mentioning that the breakfast has many styles and good service. I have two details. 1. The chef of the Xiaolongbao steamed it and brought it out. He joked with us and helped me put it on the plate, for fear of breaking it. 2. There are two coffee machines, and you can take paper cups to take away. This is the first hotel I have stayed in so many hotels that can provide guests with coffee paper cups. This hotel will also be an alternative hotel for us to play in Pudong in the future. I will stay again next time I have the opportunity, and it is highly praised. Services, health, facilities are good

As shown in the actual picture, the place is relatively small and only suitable for young children under the age of 4. Also, since the place is so small, it can get crowded once there are too many people. There is no service personnel management in this area, and access to and out of the area is based on specially given cards. There is no parent-child element other than this place, and the rooms of the parent-child package will not provide children's products. Although the hotel as a whole feels a bit shabby, but there is a swimming pool, also, the experience is good when there are not many people. It's just that the changing room of the swimming pool is relatively simple and has no heating, and it is cold to take a shower and change clothes. The buffet breakfast and dinner are better than nothing. There is no content, but the attitude of the service staff is very good.

msg:First, I told the front desk in advance that I needed a quieter room, but I was assigned a room with a leaky glass.
Second, when I wanted to take a bath in the bathtub, I found that there was unknown body hair in it, and the hygiene was poor.
Third, there are many uncleanable stains on the floor stalls in the room, which directly deduct points from the good impression.
Fourth, when I checked in, I saw the list of the minibar. When I opened it, there was nothing. When I checked out, I found out that there is no such service except for the executive room. It is recommended to cancel the display of this service on the hotel homepage.
In short, the experience of staying this time is very poor, and the way I dealt with the lobby manager can't make me feel sincere (I don't want a pack of white rabbit toffee, and I will upgrade to a suite next time) and it is listed in the hotel's promotional book. Also saw a 100% satisfied promotion.

msg:During the Chinese New Year, the school requires children not to leave Shanghai, so they can only take her to play in the city. Because the little guy wanted to go to the safari park, but he didn't want to go home directly, so he chose Powerlong Radisson. On the day of check-in on the fifth day of the new year, the hotel gave me a free room type upgrade, and upgraded the executive suite I booked to a presidential suite ! The presidential suite is really big. There are ovens and induction cookers. If you don't want to go out and just stay in the hotel, you can make delicious food yourself. After entering the presidential suite, there is a hall on the right hand side, which is divided into a living room and a dining room. There is a TV wall in the middle of the two halls as a separation. There is also a small office and study room in the hall. On the left side of the suite entrance is the bedroom area. The bedroom faces east, and when the weather is good, you can watch the sunrise (please ignore my photography skills in Figure 9). The bathroom in the bedroom is very large, with floor-to-ceiling windows facing east. When the sun is shining, open the electric curtains and the whole bathroom is very comfortable. bright. There is a corridor from the bedroom to the living room. I like this, because those who play games in the living room will not disturb those who rest in the bedroom, which is very good. There is also a small bathroom on the right side of the suite entrance, which is convenient for watching TV and playing in the living room and eating in the dining room. There are not many varieties of breakfast in the hotel, but you can eat enough and basic nutrition can be guaranteed. The hotel is still far from the Caolu Baolong City Plaza on the edge, and it takes about ten minutes to walk there. The hotel staff are very good, the front desk is warmly received, and the staff will take the initiative to say hello when they encounter the staff in the aisle on the floor. Stayed for three days and two nights and felt good all day.

I was quite happy, but after I entered the room, I found that the cup holder of the gaming chair was obviously not clean. The coffee stains and dirt may be the negligence of cleaning. After responding to the hotel, we changed our room, but there was no room upgrade trea**ent, it was still a superior room, and there was no e-sports equipment (the colleagues were very disappointed with this). In addition, it may be due to seasonal reasons. The room does not provide cold air-conditioning, only hot air-conditioning. Whether it is turned on or not, it is very stuffy and difficult to sleep. Later, the hotel provided an electric fan, but it was better than nothing. To be honest, this experience is not very good, I hope Can be improved, while providing cold air-conditioning and hot air-conditioning for the residents to choose. In addition, the hotel buffet breakfast needs to be purchased separately, and it is not cheap in terms of price, and the taste is average.
The service attitude of the hotel throughout the stay is very good, overall it is not satisfactory, but because there are no hotels of the same level in the surrounding area, I should stay at the Baolong Radisson next time.

The surrounding area is basically filled with restaurants. I want to say that the room hygiene is bad because it should be no problem. Go and take a look at the layer of floating dust on their hair dryer jacket. It's almost... There is nothing in the small refrigerator in the room, and the phone in the room is broken. If I want two cans of ice-cola, I can only use my mobile phone to call the switchboard to the hotel. After half an hour, if I didn't deliver it, I called it again. The hotel said to help me urge it. About ten minutes later, the hotel called me on my mobile phone and asked if I was sure to buy Coke at the hotel. Because the hotel’s Coke was more expensive, I hung up the phone and left the room that night! This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in in my life. Really, the service is not as good as a chain hotel, so disgusting! By the way, the checkout refund is not received on the same day, two days later...

The important thing is that some old Shanghai decorations in the hotel are very interesting. The Chinese restaurant on the first floor tastes good Shanghai cuisine. Yes, the room is spacious and comfortable, and Xiao Qiao at the front desk is also kind and enthusiastic, looking forward to staying again next time!

There are facilities for children to play in the lobby on the first floor. Children have fun there. There is also a shopping mall next to the hotel. Basically all food and use are available. Next time there is a foundation, I will stay again!

msg:[pool] choose this hotel because it is the only hotel with its own swimming pool in the area around 10 km. Although the western world center also has a swimming pool, but from the hotel next to go out, compared to directly to the building swimming pool, is not the same convenience.

The second advantage is that the size of the house is very spacious.

🍃 Environment: There are small business circles, convenience stores, fast food restaurants, coffee shops and so on next to it. Enough, but not compared to the large business circle in the center.

🚗 Transportation: between two subway stations.

🔔Service: The hall has a pleasant but not a strong fragrance, and the service is very good.

Overall, compared to the price, the location is slightly on the edge, replaced by a large room, a pool, service and breakfast.

The tea in the mini bar is dlimah, and there is no capsule coffee machine. The bed is soft, and it doesn't feel like it is. The whole is ordinary. If you don't want to enjoy other facilities, it may feel like the whole season where the price is 200 cheaper.

msg:The hotel rooms are quite satisfactory and the room service is prompt. I want to focus on the restaurant’s service. That day, when the baby was eating for breakfast, the braces were taken off. I left a bag of napkins on the table and forgot to take it. Later, I remembered when I entered the room, and ran down and the table was cleaned. Should it be the restaurant manager? It was the little girl in the picture who offered to take us to the kitchen, and she came to look through the trash can to help me find it. It's all kitchen waste, and the answer is very dirty. The little girl rummaged and pinched a little while wearing gloves. After looking for it for a long time, she found it! A brace and a brace are about 800. I am really grateful to the restaurant service staff. To be honest, it is really rare to be so enthusiastic and responsible. Thinking of a Japanese drama around the hotel that I watched a long time ago, a person with such a spirit of service will definitely rise to the top in the future~

msg:進大堂第一印象感覺設計風格很不錯，簡約大氣，設施設備很好，大堂沙發坐起來很舒適、香薰很好聞，前台Sophie和Amy辦理的入住，入住流程很快，服務很好，給人感覺很親切，前台有鮮花擺設看到後心情就很好，房間非常乾淨，酒店位置佳，還可以免費停車。停車場位置多。酒店出行遊玩也很方便,地鐵口離酒店蠻近的，可以乘坐地鐵出行，很是方便，附近還有一個寶龍廣場，到晚上的時候人很多，可能因為周邊有很多大學，所以比較熱鬧，還有便利店，商場，以及小吃，挺熱鬧的，購物用餐都特別方便。

前台免費升級了行政房，樓層較高，比較安靜，視野也不錯。酒店主打老上海風情，大廳有黃包車供拍照，房間裏也有老上海的照片。服務人員也很熱情主動。一樓有中餐和西餐，滿足了不出酒店的餐飲需求，早餐在西餐廳，東西不算很多，但是滿足中西式用餐需求，服務員很勤快，會主動上前詢問並收拾乾淨。
總體而言，是個很舒服的酒店，性價比很高，考慮以後帶娃來過週末。

一個小時以後温度仍無變化我的牙具也沒來，要我再打前台電話

       不足之處：酒店有點舊了，房間的門不是很好，別人關門我們的門也會發出很大的聲音，還有吹風機也不是很好用，要一手扶着電線一手吹，否則插口一直掉。國慶期間人實在太多早餐管理比較混亂，一味往裡麪放人，但是根本沒有座位了，導致裏面亂哄哄，站着找位置的，搶位置的，吵架的。早餐品種也比較少，無功無過吧。

入住當天，發現幾乎滿房，有點擔心服務會不到位，但事實證明，無論是前台接待但是客房服務打掃都很人情友善。前台的一個美女小姐姐還給我們升級了房間，超級幸運👍
玩得很開心，晚上還點了夜宵，超市飲料，送貨也很快，交通便利。唯一遺憾是旁邊的濕地公園在裝修，沒有開放。
下次有機會，還要選擇，再把周邊好好玩一玩

1辦理入住慢的要死，這哪是星級酒店的效率，外面如家都比他快！
五星級酒店，在疫情的情況下，房間連消毒洗手液都沒有
2 游泳池很臟，還不如健身房的游泳池！
3 海鮮自助火鍋。連刷的肉都沒有。蟹肉棒，蝦球全是麪粉團。唯一能吃就是素菜了。燒烤位就一個很小的地址，一個師傅在烤，還限量又不是什麼好的海鮮食材。可以説外面任何一家火鍋店，都比她食材好。後來我觀察了她們的後廚，嚴重臟亂差。我老公回來還****拉肚子不至。我和女兒吃的比較少。這種情況下，生蠔我都放棄了，哪敢吃！！
反正是非常非常極其不滿意！！

1）客人權益無保障。加了行政房，沒有行政餐廳早餐歡樂時光等等任何服務就算了，加贈的大堂vip體驗券也不主動給，第二天自己看到了廣告牌去問了才給，而且衹給了第二天的。攜程積分明明兑換了延遲退房，酒店以春節客房滿為由拒絕 ，事後表示沒有注意到系統上有權益兑換，經要求後酒店方才聯繫攜程退權益；2）住兩天客房入住時就已繳費，下午數通電話反覆問預訂人訊息，表示找不到第二天的訂單，那早上入住的時候如何對第二天的訂單進行收費的？而且第二天下午14點後，卡居然失效了，要自己去前台辦理，酒店表示這是系統原因3）客房含早，第一天告知需要領早餐券才能用餐，但是要前一天晚餐時餐廳才能給到我們第二天的早餐券，好像不是客房含早，而是買晚餐送早餐一般，難道我不吃酒店的晚餐就拿不到早餐券了？
