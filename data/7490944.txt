The fish head soup in the Chinese restaurant was very fresh, and there was a stir-fried meat with steamed buns that was very good. Although there was chili, it was not spicy, and the children could eat it. Thank you housekeeper Xiao Chen for your enthusiastic service throughout the whole process!

msg:Very good. Originally, I only booked one day on May 1st. My parents thought it was great. One hour after arriving at the room, they immediately decided to extend it for another day. Although the price doubled on May 2nd, I still think it is worth the price. It's just too cheap on weekdays. The pillows are soft and hard, and the mattress is not soft, which is just what I like. The waiter responded very quickly when I called him in the early morning. The experience is very good. From the moment I got off the car, the concierge immediately moved the luggage and then arranged a car to take me to the room. Usually, you can just call the front desk if you need a car. Even if it is almost full on May Day, you don't have to wait for a long time. I once forgot that it was May Day holiday. The breakfast is also great and quite rich. I ate in the Chinese restaurant and the local restaurant at the door. I prefer the local restaurant. The taste and cost performance are good. The hotel has charging piles and a huge parking lot. It is not difficult to park even if the holiday is full and there is a wedding. After checking in, the concierge will immediately contact the parking lot to arrange a parking space. The hotel also has its own yacht dock. There are weddings for two consecutive days, which shows that the hotel is still good. In general, the software service is very good, the environment is great, the room is large, the bedding quality is good, and it feels like a vacation. I will recommend it to others and will come again.

Environment: The hotel is built along the lake, covers a large area, has a beautiful lake view and a large forest, and is a small holiday paradise. Even if the town and scenic spots are full of people during the May Day holiday, it is still quite quiet in the hotel. The hotel is not too far from the town, and it is 20 yuan by taxi, and it is quite convenient to get in and out.
Service: What is more surprising is that such a large hotel now also implements the common butler service model of homestays. The day before check-in, the butler Yu Duoduo contacted me to add WeChat. During the stay, he kept contacting me through WeChat to answer various service needs. He was very considerate and responsive.
Catering: Breakfast is a buffet with many varieties and timely replenishment. Even during the peak passenger flow during the May Day holiday, it is still orderly.
The hotel also provides bicycle rentals. You can rent them for free by taking photos and checking in. It is quite pleasant to ride around the lake. The hot spring was not open during the May Day stay, which is a bit regrettable.

msg:First of all, this parent-child dinosaur theme room is not suitable for children. 1. There is no bathtub or tub in the room, only a shower. Our baby takes a bath in a tub at home, but cries when taking a bath in this hotel. 2. The children's activity area is one step higher than other areas. This causes children to go up and down a step to play, which is unsafe. 3. The edges of the tiles in the activity area are not wrapped, which poses a safety hazard. 4. The children's activity area is by the window and has no guardrails. Combined with the tornado in Jiangxi that blew people away a few days ago, or if there is a problem with the quality of the glass, it is still unsafe.
Secondly, the service spirit and service attitude of the hotel are very average. We went to the Chinese restaurant on the second floor of the hotel front desk for dinner on the first day. I forgot to bring a bib for the baby. Later, I saw that the babies of other tables who came later asked the waiter to get a bib, and then asked the waiter to get one for us. As a result, the waiter said that there was only one... I don’t know if there is only one in the whole restaurant, or it happened that there was no one when it was our turn, or the waiter didn’t want to get it. In theory, if the restaurant sees that we brought our baby to eat, it should take the initiative to provide baby tableware and bibs if there are any.
Finally, the most important thing is that safety guarantees are not in place.

It is next to the core scenic spot of Qiandao Lake. In the group purchase package, the hotel upgraded me to a boutique lake view. , the room is quite big, and it’s good to rest in the room. The bed is very comfortable, soft and supportive, which I like. The bath water is a little uneven in hot and cold, but luckily it doesn’t affect it. The hot spring provided is basically used by hotel guests. It is not big, but it is quite comfortable to soak in it. It’s too late to play in the hotel swimming pool. I believe children will like the outdoor swimming pool very much in summer. The chef at the door was warm and thoughtful👍, and introduced clearly. Check-in was a bit busy because there was a group. There are many varieties of breakfast, I like the tofu pudding😄. After eating, I rented a car from the hotel and rode along the lake, which was great. I am satisfied with this vacation and will come again next time🥰

The hotel facilities and services are very good, the environment is also good, and it is very suitable for leisure travel~ The breakfast is very rich, and you can also make rice balls and waffles by yourself; the Chinese restaurant has enough dishes, good taste, and fish head soup!
Because the hotel is located very close to the inside, it is not convenient to take a taxi in and out. You have to wait for the kind driver to take the order and drive in 3km to pick you up.

msg:The hotel is not particularly big. It is built on the mountain. It has a swimming pool and a gym. The swimming pool is indoors and outdoors. In winter, it can be indoors. In summer, it is definitely more fun to play in the water outside. I came here to take a bath in the winter at night. There are several small hot spring pools, not many of which are open. It is quite comfortable to take a dip in the evening and take a bath and sleep. The parent-child room I booked this time has a large bed and bunk beds, which is very spacious. The housekeeper also took the initiative to contact us via WeChat to ask if she had any needs, and her attitude was very good. The breakfast is mainly Chinese style, but also includes toasted bread, freshly cooked noodles and wontons. The special features are rice balls and waffles that you can make yourself. They are delicious when they are hot, and the kids are happy to make them and eat them. The children are just over 120, and there is no extra charge for breakfast. The big hotel is very user-friendly. Come and play in the water in the summer.

The room assigned to us was also very good. Three rooms diagonally. The lake view room can just watch the sunset. There are also many recreational facilities in the scenic area. There are hot springs. Villa area. There is a chess and card room. Swimming pool etc. There are cute little squirrels on the high observation deck. I feel like I can stay a few more days next time, which is very suitable for company team building~ In addition, the service of Butler Xiao Chen is also very good. During this period, I asked her many times to arrange some things for us. Everything was done quickly and well. And she responds very quickly every time. He is a serious and responsible person.

The housekeeper Xiao Chen was very enthusiastic and answered all our questions. He also patiently helped us find things if we forgot them. Great!
The children are already eager to wait until summer to play in the water again hahahahahahahaha

The environment is good and there are several observation platforms. You can walk around when you are free. Someone said before that the villa's hygiene was poor, so they booked a hotel room. In fact, the villa was not bad, and hygiene is a matter of opinion. Breakfast was ok and had everything you need. The meal provided was not very picky, but the taste was okay. I would definitely need to add a few more dishes, and the price of the extra dishes would definitely be expensive... Speaking of the room, the facilities are old, and some things should be repaired or replaced. Shower water pressure is not stable. The view from the balcony is definitely not as good as that from the villa... There are quite a lot of places for children to play. The indoor swimming pool is very good. In the summer, it is also good to look outside. In addition, the hot spring is quite comfortable. This is how you feel when you are on vacation. It is comfortable. Go...

Jasmine, concubine, angelica, sulfur. Jasmine is too hot, Angelica is the most suitable temperature.
I took a walk in the forest in the morning and the air was very good. The price is okay as the Spring Festival ends.
The only drawback is that ordering takeout is inconvenient. It has a minimum delivery fee of 100 yuan and a 25 delivery fee.

The girl at the front desk said that the room was full the day before and the sanitation had not been done well. She said it would take an hour. Then the boy at the front desk said it would take 20 minutes and then half an hour. There was no unified answer. , were all checking in, and there were no rules at all. It was not completed until around 3 o'clock. It was also strange that other guests could check in. Maybe the room type we booked was too bad, hahahaha😂 2. Room hygiene Too bad, the decoration is also very old, the hot water is hot and cold, I booked two rooms with garden view, one room has a very strong smell of paint, I asked the front desk, the front desk said that the outside of the garden view room has been painted, but the smell of the room is very strong anyway

I think it’s really important to choose the right place to relax and unwind during your vacation. A trip of 3 days and 2 nights, plus breakfast on 2 days, plus a hot spring for 2 people, is really worth it.

🏙️ After arriving at the hotel, the personal butler was waiting in the lobby to assist with check-in, which made my family and I feel the warmth and hospitality of the hotel.
🌈😍The hotel’s breakfast offerings are also very colorful. It is a surprise to have your own DIY waffles and egg waffles, and there is even a chef making flying pancakes on site.
🌟 The environment of the hotel is very good, as if the air is sweet. After breakfast in the morning, it felt so good to take a walk along the lake with my family.
 🎬The recreation center has a cinema and Cassia Beach, where children have a lot of fun. The indoor swimming pool is also good, and children can spend half a day there. There is also a Squirrel Paradise, where you can take your children to interact with small animals.
🎋With the free 100 fish head coupon, I ordered fish head in the restaurant. The fish🐠 was very delicious and tasted amazing. You can’t eat such delicious fish head in other cities.
⭐️ The service is more enthusiastic and the items are delivered in a timely manner. All in all it was a great experience.

msg:The room was clean and spacious. The room we stayed in was a short distance from the lobby, but no matter how late it was, as long as we called the front desk, there would be a shuttle bus to pick us up from the hotel, which was very convenient! Before I moved in, Xiao Chen, the hotel’s personal butler, had already contacted me and told us that we could contact her if we had any questions. The service is very attentive and considerate. The hotel facilities are very suitable for parents and children. Even the restaurant has a children's playground, where children have a lot of fun. The public toilets in the hotel have a special room for children, which is very considerate. We only stayed one night. When we visited the hotel the next day, we discovered that the hotel also had an observation deck and a squirrel park, which the children loved. The hotel's heated swimming pool is also very good, and the water temperature of the children's pool is deliberately higher than that of the adult area. There is also a pink sandpit, which was also discovered last. The scenery from the terrace of the lake view room is also great. This is definitely a treasure hotel and I will come back again.

Knowing that we have elderly people traveling, he specially arranged a room close to the elevator entrance and informed us of the best viewing location, No. 5 Observation Deck. The best view is Squirrel Paradise, and the No. 8 observation deck is the best for watching the sunset. The hotel's battery car is very convenient to come and go, and you are always on call. Although some parts of the hotel are a bit old, it does not affect the overall quality of the hotel.

msg:The scenery outside the window is very nice, but the decoration of the hotel is indeed a bit old.

1 There was a musty smell when I entered the house. I opened the window for several hours before it dissipated. It was not difficult to see that the sink, air conditioner and other places had traces of moisture and mold.

2. The door crack allows light to pass through. This is quite bad. With such a large crack, safety and privacy are not guaranteed.

3. When cleaning the room, I don’t know if it was because I made the bed a little bit by myself, but I didn’t even help tidy up the quilt while cleaning. In addition, a 500 deposit is required when checking in, but it is not refunded immediately when checking out. This experience is quite strange. I don’t know if it is because I have stayed in other hotels less, and I feel that I have not encountered an additional deposit in a long time, or the deposit is not for check-out. It's time to settle immediately.

Overall, I feel that the environment is good, but for an experience like 700 a night, the price/performance ratio is average.

msg:Originally, I wanted to avoid the Asian Games when I took my children out to play this time. However, due to lack of geographical knowledge, I went to Qiandao Lake and thought that Qiandao Lake had nothing to do with the Asian Games. I didn’t expect that this place also belongs to Hangzhou and there is a road cycling competition. I had no choice, it was almost night, so I chose this hotel after checking it on Ctrip. It was very cost-effective.

Unexpectedly, I felt great after checking in. This hotel is equivalent to an independent resort, with indoor and outdoor swimming pools. The scenery is very beautiful. The most important thing is that we actually watched the public bicycle competition at the door. The children loved the table tennis table here. , played table tennis all morning, and then also swam.

Especially the breakfast, it was great. We made the sandwich ourselves. Our two children didn't like to eat at first, but because we could make the sandwich bread ourselves, we each made two and ate them.

Sometimes when traveling, we are traveling backwards and we don’t have many guests, so the price/performance ratio is very high.

It is recommended to choose a hotel when visiting Qiandao Lake.

Thanks to the guy at the front desk who helped us upgrade our room. It turned out to be a view room to a lake view room. Thank you so much, as a platinum member of Ctrip. Enjoyed the benefits, thank you again!

In addition, this kind of large resort doesn't care at all about charging children for breakfast. Our child is almost 1.4 meters tall and should have been charged half price, but the hotel did not charge it. Thank you very much. These experiences are very good.

Originally, during the National Day holiday, all families took their children with them. If they charged more fees, it would give the children a bad experience. I believe the hotel must have made standard adjus**ents in this regard. The experience was very good and highly recommended!

msg:I decided to go to Qiandao Lake just two weeks before the National Day. I looked at the map on Ctrip and booked a hotel near the lake for 5 days and 4 nights. The result was exactly as expected.
    The hotel's hardware is considered to be a decent five-star hotel. It is located in the central lake area of ​​Qiandao Lake, with rooms facing the lake, indoor and outdoor swimming pools, and a "Wizard of Oz" area suitable for children to play.
    The most satisfying thing is the enthusiastic service of the hotel housekeeper Wang Duoduo. A few days before the trip, he called to remind me to pay attention to the traffic restrictions during the Asian Games. After arriving at the hotel, he enthusiastically introduced the various facilities and services of the hotel. After checking in, I felt a layer of dampness. Duoduo not only helped us upgrade to a lake view room on the 5th floor, but also helped pack and carry our luggage to the new room (we were not in the hotel that day). My daughter's small and trivial items were not left behind. She was really warm and meticulous. . When I checked out at the end of the five-day trip, I was given souvenirs and carefully prepared birthday noodles. All in all, this trip to Qiandao Lake was really enjoyable. I will choose this place next time I come to Qiandao Lake.

3. The hotel's internal facilities are a bit old, and the indoor sanitary ware is old and smelly;
4. The hotel service cannot be said to be of five-star standard. Zhongan Group manages it independently and is not at the same level as star-rated management;
5. The "Shimicang" restaurant attached to the hotel is really nondescript. The Northeastern cauldron stews Qiandao Lake fish head -😇. The taste and service are not even up to the level of small street restaurants! The set meal given to customers feels a bit deceptive.

There are indoor and outdoor swimming pools, a children's playground, a chess and card room, a gym, a cultural corridor for hundreds of surnames, a coffee bar, and almost every corner is equipped with a combination of sofas, tables and chairs, which is convenient for Ge You to lie on.

msg:Choosing the wrong hotel will really ruin your entire travel itinerary. This hotel is an example. I arrived after 13 o'clock. It stands to reason that I can go to play in the afternoon, but the hotel arrived I was not given a room until 14:30. Waited in the lobby for a long time, but the room was cleaned, and they didn't take the initiative to inform me. Then it was almost 15 o'clock when the shuttle bus entered the room, so I didn't go anywhere on the first day of the trip to Qiandao Lake. I was also drunk when I entered the room they said they upgraded me to. I don’t know how the room was before the upgrade, but it was better. The upgraded room is really not good, even though there is a lake ditch The scenery of the ditch is that a cable is pulled in the middle of the lake, and the cable is also on the side of the lake, ugly! Secondly, there are 4 seats in the room, all 4 seats are dirty, I dare not sit on them, the sofa is dark and not very clean, and the lampshade is also surrounded by dirt as shown in the picture. As many people complained and responded, I also encountered that the shuttle bus did not pick up, and the pick-up bus did not pick up. I went to have breakfast in the morning and waited for more than 20 minutes at the door of the hotel room. It was more than 30 degrees in summer. Because I booked a cruise ticket for the Qiandao Lake tour on the same day, I didn't dare to delay, so I went straight down. What's even more exasperating is that after walking down, I found that the restaurant was chaotic, and I was not allowed to enter! ! ! It was full. Look at the dozens of people in front of me. I saw someone come out with a bag full of fruit in a plastic bag. The people inside are also scrambling for seats everywhere. This scene... I felt powerless and suffering from heatstroke all day long on the cruise ship and on the island. I didn't eat well in the morning, and I couldn't play well all day. I'm not in a good mood either. In the evening, the cruise ship returned to the hotel and it rained heavily. The two-night trip to Qiandao Lake ended in such a disappointing way. Also, when the hotel was cleaning the room, they threw away my mobile phone waterproof bag. They refused to admit it, and even falsely accused Ctrip that I left it in the room when I checked out. I bought two, one rose red and one green. The rose red ones were washed and dried in the room and I called the front desk to complain that they were lost.

msg:I saw the introduction of this hotel from other groups before, and I just planned to go out again, so I booked this hotel with a feeling of apprehension. After all, there are so many people during the summer vacation, and it is often caused by the fact that the goods are not right and the actual situation of the hotel is not good. I read a lot of comments about the unhappy journey, so I didn't hold out much hope. When our car arrived at the entrance of the hotel, the uncle who greeted the guests was very enthusiastic and helped to carry the luggage. This good start made me a little relieved, and then I checked in at the front desk. There were many people, and the service attitude of the little brother at the front desk was very good. Later, a young lady helped me check in, and the whole process was very fast. Then there is a small tram to take us to the guest room. The uncle who drives the tram is also very enthusiastic. The attitude of these service staff makes people feel at home. Booked a courtyard room, on the first floor, relatively cool. From the elevator to the fifth floor of the hotel, you can reach the outdoor swimming pool through the recreation center, and there are changing rooms. If you need to store it, you can first go to the thatched shed in the center of the swimming pool and ask the staff to exchange the room card for the locker key. Then you can go swimming. It's a little bit sunny outside, and the water temperature is high. There is also an indoor swimming pool inside. The water temperature is only 25°C, which is too cold, but the water quality is cleaner than outside. Swimming rings can be rented for ten yuan each. For dinner, you can eat hotel buffet and Chinese food, or you can drive out by yourself. It’s a little far away. If we don’t want to go out, we can eat at the hotel. The buffet is 128 yuan per person, and the dishes are quite rich. Meals are upstairs where you check in. From the guest room, you can call the front desk in the room to call for a shuttle bus, or you can walk over there. Haha, it’s too hot, so we choose to call a taxi. The breakfast buffet in the morning is also good, satisfying both the elderly and children. I used Ctrip's Flash Stay, no deposit required, and check-out is super fast. Great.

The hotel is so big that it takes a shuttle bus from the front desk to the room. We live relatively close, and the villa area should be further away. If the weather is cool, it is very comfortable to take a walk inside the hotel. Unfortunately, the weather we went to was too hot and we couldn't stay outside for too long.
The masters at the front desk and the shuttle bus are very enthusiastic.
The indoor swimming pool is large and also open to the public.
To complain, the hotel's Chinese restaurant is not good.
Disadvantages: The lake near the river is full of garbage such as leaves, which the eyes don't like. The rooms facing the lake are always close to the rainwater or sewage inlet, and the water flow is very loud. The overall humidity in the room is high, there are water droplets on the glass, and there is a faint musty smell inside the hotel, which is understandable if it is near the lake.
In short, if you come again, you will still choose and recommend.

Upstairs Downstairs, if you think about upstairs and downstairs, forget it at once. When I actually checked in, the two rooms were not in the same building, which disappointed me. It takes half a day for the two children to meet each other, and they go around. And the mermaid themed room smelled very musty. The next day, we negotiated with the hotel and agreed to change the room for us, which was quite satisfactory. The room has mini amu*****t facilities that children like, and children like it very much. There is no complimentary fruit snack, I think other rooms have it, maybe Ctrip didn't order it. The outdoor swimming pool is very good, but unfortunately it rained for a few days, so I didn't go there much. Unfortunately, there is a restaurant in Shimi Lane at the door, which is very good, the taste is good, and the price is not expensive.

Hygiene: The room is also very clean, and there are dehumidifiers in the room, so it won't be too humid
Environment: Because the room I booked is a courtyard double room, the rooms are all on the first floor, but they are not humid at all. There is also a large courtyard, and you can see the lake view outside the courtyard! ! !
Service: When it comes to service, I have to say that the hotel’s butler-style service is really convenient. If you have any questions, you can consult the butler🥳. The waiters from the lobby to the room are very enthusiastic, and the hotel is doing a cultural theme of hundreds of surnames , the whole hotel is filled with ancient music, and I will come again next time! I also recommend my little sisters to experience different room types together🥰

In the evening, I had dinner at the Chinese restaurant of the resort. It was not expensive. That nest Wotou fried pork is delicious, and the breakfast is also rich! The hotel booked at the same time sent us mountain bikes because they didn't want hot springs! marvelous! free! It also saves the car money, otherwise it will cost 30 yuan/hour to rent a car outside! come back sometime

The handsome guy who checked in gave him a room with a large bathtub with a lake view. On a rainy day, he looked at the misty and rainy mountains and rivers outside the window. He made a pot of tea and lay down in the bathtub, sipped tea, read a book, listened to music, enjoyed the beautiful scenery, and watched the birds frolicking in the sky, relaxing his body and mind. .

msg:The hotel is flashy, whoever lives in it will be fooled! I am planning to visit Qiandao Lake during the May 1st holiday. On April 23, I used Ctrip to rank first, five diamonds, and the price was 2758 and 3296 per night. I decided to buy a luxurious lake-view king bed and a deluxe lake-view parent-child family room for 2 nights. The total cost was 12811 Yuan. But after checking in, it ruined the three views! The luxurious lake view has turned into a small river ditch outside the balcony and there is noise from the balcony dripping water. The lake view of the parent-child room is a virtue, and the hotel is temporarily changed to theme rooms such as dinosaurs and mermaids due to holidays. Pungent, although the children like it very much, but for the sake of their health, they decisively questioned the hotel customer service and reported all the problems. The * director of the hotel's marketing depar**ent asked us to pack our luggage immediately and change rooms for us. We were taken to a 2-bedroom and a 2 There is an L-shaped one-bedroom and one-living room on the first floor. The 2 bedrooms on the ground floor have a severe musty smell, but I was told that there are only these 2 rooms. The hotel staff also said that there is indeed a bit of musty smell. They said that turning on the air conditioner will not cause the smell. The hotel is close to dinner time We also gave us a buffet as a gift. The mouth of others is soft. There is indeed no room and we have to move in. However, after dinner, the 2-bedroom room still smells and has no windows. We have to open the door to ventilate, and then send a WeChat message to the hotel. Marketing Director, the reason why we booked the deluxe lake view room is to enjoy the beautiful scenery of Qiandao Lake in the morning and evening. We asked to change the deluxe lake view room tomorrow, and promised to replace it with a 2-bedroom villa the next day. I checked Ctrip that night during the May Day holiday and the price was about 3869 (estimated to be lower before the holiday). The next morning, I took me to see the house. After seeing it, I was satisfied immediately, but I asked for a refund. The hotel was then I felt a bit surprised by my request. After I calculated the price, I realized that I could only refund more than 2,000 yuan, but I said it should be more than 3,000 yuan. I agreed at first, but then regretted it. The hotel said that the price of the room we stayed in last night was more expensive than what I had set. I was very annoyed at the time. Reasons: 1. I didn’t stay in the luxurious lake view room I wanted. 2. The room I stayed in even smelled musty and I was forced to stay 3. If the upgrade of the room is indeed caused by the hotel, how can the price difference be borne by the guests (not to mention the really poor room). According to the normal logic, the refund should be 12,811 yuan (total amount paid) - 2,758 yuan * 2 nights (2 ordinary rooms forced to stay) - 3,869 yuan (2-bedroom villa) = 3,426 yuan, which is my right rights and interests! But the hotel just refused to refund, and only refunded more than 2,000. I had to call Ctrip's customer service, but the customer service coordinated for several hours to no avail. I was very helpless, because I didn't want to waste time on this matter because I took my children to play. I told Ctrip that it would be fine to refund the 3296 yuan on my order for one night. Ctrip contacted I contacted the hotel's * director to no avail, and the hotel didn't take the initiative to contact me to solve the problem. In the end, I was really helpless. I contacted the hotel *manager and told her that I would contact the Market Supervision Bureau and the Consumer Association to complain about their hotel, and then asked me to go back to the hotel at night to discuss. After meeting with a *summary* manager of the hotel that night , I described what happened, and President * said after listening to it, I will act according to my opinion! Back 3296! I felt speechless at the moment, as if I was blackmailing them, please, this is the money I paid myself, I just want to refund the overpaid money to protect my own rights, not you to compensate me for the loss! I thought about it, maybe this hotel has this kind of virtue, there is no basic knowledge, no logic and no understanding of how to serve customers, just think about it, there is no need to waste energy on this kind of thing! Xiaoshen, Ctrip's customer service, was very helpful in coordinating this matter. He apologized to me and asked the platform to compensate me 1,600 yuan. This amount of money is not important, but I feel understanding and respect! However, I personally feel that Ctrip’s platform chooses such a poor hotel and makes it into a five-diamond hotel, which is simply smashing its own brand!
Besides, the water heater in the villa I stayed in was broken. I called the front desk and said that the equipment was broken. After the repair, the water temperature in the shower room was very hot and could not be adjusted, and the switch of the shower was still off. I was speechless. I had to wash it in the bathtub. ...toilets, telephones are full of dirt... (attached photos), all in all a terrible experience!
With so many words, I just want to tell everyone not to make the same mistakes!

The hotel facilities are relatively new, the decoration style is not bad, the service staff is very enthusiastic, and the breakfast also meets the four-star standard.
The parking lot is estimated to be 50-100 meters away from the lobby. Tourists who drive by themselves and have a lot of luggage are recommended to drive directly to the entrance of the lobby, drop off the passengers first and then park. Some rooms are farther away from the lobby. Although there is a free battery car shuttle, I am a little worried when I think of the sudden increase in tourists during peak seasons.

What's the matter, the attitude is very good, and the handling of things is also very positive. The parent-child room is at the far end of the guest room building. It takes a while to walk from the elevator, and the corridor on the other side of the room leads to the promenade, leading to the mountain of the hotel and the villa area.

There were not many people when we went to take a dip. After 7:00 p.m., people came to soak in one after another. The thermometer showed that it was not very accurate. There was a 35-degree pool that was hotter than a 45-degree pool. He couldn't sit still, but the other Chi children were having a good time. The disadvantage is that the room is not hygienic.

Even if the room is cleaned the next day, it still stays in the same place . I called to ask for children's rubber slippers, and the guest room sent two pairs of adult slippers. In the end, I went to soak the disposable children's slippers worn by my sister, and almost fell when I came out.

There is a charge for extra mineral water. I hope it can be improved. It shouldn’t be a problem to ask for a few more bottles of water for a room rate of 2,000 per night, right?

You can contact the housekeeper at any time if you have any questions, which is very humane. Then on New Year's Eve, I watched the Spring Festival Gala outside the hotel lobby with many people and ate roasted whole lamb. It was quite unforgettable!

It is located on a peninsula. The hotel park is also very large. There are plank roads and observation decks along Qiandaohu Lake. You can enjoy the beautiful scenery of the lake without leaving the hotel. This time I booked a room with a view. The handsome guy at the front desk gave me a free upgrade to a lake view room. You can watch the sunset from the balcony. Figures 1, 2, and 3 are the beautiful views from the balcony. It is very convenient to drink tea and dry in the sun on the large balcony. 4, 5, 6 are viewing platforms and walkways in the hotel park. You can also rent bicycles in the hotel to ride around the lake, which is very convenient. I originally planned to stay for one night, and my family felt very comfortable, so I stayed an extra night later, and next time I go to Qiandao Lake, I will choose Bright!

msg:First of all, I was very satisfied with the room at the beginning. Although it is not in the center of the lake, the view is very good, the room is also very large, and the floor-to-ceiling windows are very beautiful.
Let me talk about a few problems. First, after checking in, I found that the wifi was not working. I couldn’t connect to the room at all. I called the front desk and told me to log in with a large wifi in the hotel. In the end, it was not repaired, so the TV projection could not be used.
Second, we went out during the room service the next day, and when we came back, we found that other things had been changed or tidied up, but toothbrushes and other toiletries had not been replaced, which made people very confused.
Third, the USB interface in the socket is very tight, causing the metal piece to break directly when we unplug the USB cable, which is really speechless. .
There are also some other minor problems, but overall it is passable, because the location of the hotel is not very good, so I still have some expectations for the room environment and so on at this price. I am not very satisfied in the end. I hope it can give some references to future guests ~

The hotel has ground parking spaces, but not many.
There is an underground garage with a lot of parking spaces and charging piles, but the garage elevator does not go directly to the front lobby, which is a fly in the oin**ent.
There is a battery car to and from the room, which is very convenient.
The room facilities are relatively new and clean.
Because it was New Year's Day, the hotel's outdoor swimming pool was closed.
But the warm soup is open at 6:00 p.m., and the temperature in the outdoor pools is around 38, which is very comfortable.
Choose a good time, otherwise there will be too many people in trouble.
Manager Ye at the front desk is very enthusiastic, and he handles and solves the problems raised in a timely manner, which is really great.
Overall, this resort hotel is still very good

The hotel has charging piles, which is very convenient. There is no elevator in the garage. Fortunately, it is not far to walk. There is a shuttle bus to help with luggage.
The attitude of the hotel staff is also very friendly. When we checked into the hotel, manager Yu in the lobby also gave us a small gift for our baby. The next day, I took it to the hotel Huaguo Mountain, and finally I could not go home. The little guy has to stay for one more night😂😂

Traveling with friends, the hotel called on the same day to confirm the check-in, and also thoughtfully helped to upgrade the lake view room, presented a fruit plate, and the service was satisfactory. The indoor swimming pool is clean and hygienic, there are few people, it is basically a private venue, and the experience is great. I love the drying rack on the balcony of the room. It is very practical to stay for a few days to dry clothes. I must like it. It is a hotel worth choosing when I come to Qiandao Lake next time. The price is very high!
It is very convenient to check in for free nucleic acid once a day.

First of all, we drove two or three hours to the hotel and asked the hotel doorman where there is a parking space. The doorman said that the parking lot is full. Now, where can I find it? ? ? We asked if we could check in first, put our luggage in the room first, and park the car in front of the hotel first? The answer is: No, but a car is clearly parked at the door! The doorman's mask is also a virtual handle, and he didn't wear it at all! In the end, we found a parking space after a long circle, carrying a large bag and a small bag and walking a long way, we repeatedly thought about this kind of service, how dare you charge me 1500 a night? ? ? Does conscience not hurt? The front desk service of the hotel is not bad. The 24-hour shuttle service is also worthy of praise. The highlight of entering the room is coming! There are unidentified curls under the bathroom roller blinds, and the blinds are also very dirty! The lake view room has a balcony, and the chair is too daring to sit on. It looks very old at first glance. The floor and chairs are all faded and mottled, very, very dirty! ! ! The breakfast variety is also very small! There is an additional charge for the minibar. Friends who want to see reviews need to carefully consider whether to live here.

msg:During the National Day, the price is reasonable and the staff is very polite. Help us to upgrade from the original king bed room to the lake view queen room (thanks 🙏). It is a pity that the lake landscape is not wide enough, and only a bay of lake water can be seen. The two-day itinerary extended the room fee for one day, and the staff also renewed the fee according to the price of the previous day. The breakfast is quite satisfactory, and the swimming pool is only outdoors. Tucao: I feel that the outdoor swimming pool is not very safe. There is an "inflatable roller" in the middle that allows children to hide and roll. I almost pressed it on my head as I was swimming (I was swimming nearby) and didn't lift my head up from under the rollers for a long time (just learned the technique of swimming, but it wasn't too hard). There are also two cartoon inflatable boats that can be operated manually (with an engine?) and a little boy can't steer and almost hit my husband. Advantages: The hotel has a small road leading to the viewing platform and fruit forest, with a wide field of vision and beautiful scenery, but the weather is not hot during the National Day. There is also an electric car rental in the hotel, which is also because it is too hot and has not been used. Sitting on the balcony at night, blowing the wind and watching the stars (there are not so many stars in Shanghai) is very pleasant. If time permits, I would like to be paralyzed for a few more days... There is a nucleic acid point at the entrance of the hotel every morning, which is very convenient. The items left by my husband also took the initiative to call us and tell us to help us deliver them home, thank you very much.

msg:First of all, as soon as I arrived at the hotel, I felt the enthusiasm of the service staff and greeted them with smiles. When I checked in, I told me that I liked quiet. The very nice manager Zhang Xfang upgraded the lake view room. Every staff member in the lobby was full of smiles, although it was Mid-Autumn Festival. , There are many guests, but the staff are not only enthusiastic but also arranged in an orderly manner. It can be seen that the hotel's training and management are very good.

Environment: The environment is beautiful and quiet. There are outdoor sofas and umbrellas by the lake in the hotel. If you are tired of cycling, you can sit down for afternoon tea and enjoy the beautiful scenery at any time.
The room is spacious, clean and hygienic. There are also children's slippers. Open the floor-to-ceiling windows to see the beautiful scenery of the lake. Picture 1 is the beautiful scenery of the balcony.

The hotel shuttle bus is very fast. It is always on call. There are landlines on each floor. Pick up the phone and wait for the shuttle bus to be called. Basically, it will wait for us outside the door within 2 minutes. The efficiency is great.

The hotel is also very convenient to travel. It only takes 10 minutes to drive to Fisherman's Wharf and Food Street, but it is recommended not to drive there, because it is not easy to park there, and it is most convenient to take a taxi. 5 minutes drive to beer factory and time tunnel, very convenient

The hotel has two children's facilities, although they are not enough, they can take care of children of different ages. One is suitable for children under 3 years old, and the other is in a western restaurant, suitable for about 3 to 8 years old.

The hotel pool is very clean, there are many lifeguards, and the rental of swimming rings is also very cheap.

The breakfast at the hotel ended at 10 o'clock. There were a lot of people during the Mid-Autumn Festival. Everyone was like grabbing rice, but the attitude of the workers was very good, and the food was added in a timely manner.

Overall experience, will come again next time.

msg:It’s because there are fewer tourists and it’s convenient to visit. Qiandao Lake is a beautiful place. The weather is good these days. I spent a day on the island with my friends. Really, when the weather is fine, Qiandao Lake is as blue as the sea.
The hotel is also great. Everyone attaches great importance to the epidemic. The staff will also remind you to wear a mask and the room will be disinfected. It is reassuring. Like it

msg:This is the first time in more than 30 years of life that I have encountered such a rubbish hotel! It’s simply terrible. There are only a few peak seasons in a year, and we don’t even have the most basic bottom line for doing business. First of all, the room type I booked was completely different from the room type I actually stayed in. I was told that the original room type was full and I was given an "upgrade" with a selected lake view...****. Not only was the wall next to it blocked, but even the windows were broken. I am a smoker. How can one live without a balcony! For the sake of my child’s nap, I couldn’t bear to change it…
Forget all this...The next day I suddenly discovered that the double bed room actually has twin beds, okay? The explanation given was that the "Hollywood King Bed" was a combination... I thought that any serious hotel owner would not be able to do this, so I decisively asked the hotel to pay the difference, and finally I changed to a villa room to sleep for one night, and it was 11 midnight. At 30:30, I waited for the shuttle bus to change rooms with my child in my arms. I had not seen her for a long time. Finally, I told the auntie who had done the cleaning that she really laughed. The used plastic bags in the bathtub were still there... and the finished mineral water bottles were also in the bath... The robes are piled up wet... If you don't have the ability, don't open a hotel. During the holidays, you stay at a premium price just to have a good time. I really don't care about the complaints and close down! Whoever lives here will be fooled

It is 3 kilometers away from the cruise ship terminal and 5 kilometers away from the fish street. It is very convenient to eat. In short, I will choose to stay here for vacation.

msg:Transportation: It is relatively partial, if you are not driving by yourself, choose carefully.
Hygiene: There is a little dust in the basin, and the place for disposable slippers is not easy to find. The equipped sandals make the scalp tingling, even if there is no epidemic situation, I dare not use it, not to mention that under the current situation of such a severe epidemic, I don't know if there is any disinfection?
Environment: The so-called lake view room is to see a corner of the lake from a distance through the dense branches and leaves of the big trees. The most terrible thing is that the balconies of the two rooms are very close, and there are no railings, and the two adjacent rooms can also visit the door without taking the usual way. If it is a lady traveling alone, it is still quite scary at night, remember to lock the balcony door.
Service: I arrived at the front desk very late at night. My friend took my son to check in first. I parked the car and went in. Since the two orders were booked separately, we emphasized that the two rooms should be close together as soon as possible. Together, it is more convenient to bring children. As a result, when I went upstairs, I saw that the two rooms were next to each other, completely out of line. The floors are different, one is large and the other is small. I called the front desk and hoped to help arrange a nearby room. I explained that the front desk was very reluctant to help transfer the room for a long time, and said that it was supposed to make up the difference, since you are all like this Now, let's upgrade it for you for free! I asked her how much the upgrade fee was, and we made up for it. The only requirement was that the two rooms were close to each other. As a result, the front desk said in an impatient tone, you don't need to make up for it, just give us a good review. If it is good in all aspects, it is not required to cover everything, just to be smooth and happy during the stay. When we go on vacation, we just want to have a good time. If we are in a good mood, we will naturally give praise. But the service attitude of the front desk is really uncomfortable, and people who spend money are also disgusted.
Let's talk about breakfast. It ends at 10 o'clock. The children got up late and ate slowly. A waiter came to the table with a cold face. Hello, our breakfast will end at 10 o'clock. I don't know what it means, is it to hurry up, or what? We dare not ask, we dare not say! I asked the waiter who cooked the noodles to help cook a vermicelli, and no one said to pick it up.
In a word, the experience of staying this time is very bad. I don't know what the welcome fruit that Ctrip redeems with points is? Haven't seen this anyway. To sum up, the price is not worth it. The service, hygiene and environment are not very cost-effective. The only good thing is the uncle drivers who drive and park the passengers. Very patient to help solve the problem! In addition, at this price, there are no children's slippers and toothpaste and toothbrushes. Although there is a phone in the room, I didn't know how to contact the staff at all, and I still called the front desk. I will definitely not choose this hotel again next time. Reality sucks...

msg:The following is the real and objective evaluation after the experience:

Satisfaction:
1. The hotel has upgraded the villa room, which is also very grateful for the phone call before check-in to inform the upgraded room type, with satisfaction and expectations!
2. The villa area is quiet, sound insulation is good, and the scenery is also good!
Bad review:
1. There is a very strong musty smell in the room, it smells like rhinitis, and the throat is also very uncomfortable
2. The sanitation in the corner of the room is a bit worrying, dust, bug corpses, and a large live cockroach in the bathroom the next morning, how did it come when the doors and windows were not opened?
3. There are various charges for the room. For the first time, there are charges for air essential oils, sewing kits, and disposable bathtub covers. Except for two bottles of Nongfu Spring and a few packs of tea and coffee for free, all the items in the refrigerator will be charged. Let's learn about the hotels under Atour and Huazhu!
4. Don't think about ordering takeout while you live there. There are not many takeaway shops nearby. Some of them are delivered from hundreds of yuan.
5. Ctrip clearly states that we check out at 14:00, but you want us to check out at 12:00, and our attitude is firm, and we have a rush to leave. After all, we finally agreed.
6. Do you have to clean the room according to your schedule? This is also the first time I met. Auntie knocked on the door to clean at noon. We hadn’t gone out yet, so we asked to clean it a little later. We were reluctant. We insisted on cleaning while we were still there. In the end, we went directly to the bathroom to change the towels and paper towels. , and then left. I was really stunned, there is such an operation?
7. The staff of the cafeteria are black-faced throughout the whole process, and only come once during the closing period, and there are not many people.
8. It takes more than an hour for the Chinese restaurant to deliver food, so please wait.

In a word: I thought that the hotel would upgrade the room type, and it would be okay to have some shortcomings, but I was very angry about the check-out, and you are not wronged to give a bad review. won't come again next time

msg:I have stayed in many good hotels, but the first time I wanted me to review it was Bright. The environment is great too! Day and night have their own scenery. The structure of the hotel makes the guests very scattered. There are not many people in the accommodation area during Golden Week. It is very quiet, because with two children, it would be very satisfying to lie in the hotel and watch the scenery. . The breakfast is relatively simple, and the room facilities are not particularly exquisite, but it is enough to open the door and open the window. The suite I ordered is very suitable for children and the elderly, and will come again.

msg:Generally speaking, it is quite average. If you like the lake view in the room, don't consider it.
The lake-view double room booked during the National Day for more than 1,800 nights is not worth it


bonus:
The hotel is relatively large, even if the National Day is full, it does not feel crowded; the overall links and facilities are okay, there are plenty of areas for children to do activities, the comprehensive facilities are good, and there is a swimming pool.
There is a Starbucks directly next door to the hotel lobby, which is very convenient
There is an open-air movie barbecue in the hotel at night, it is more comfortable to sit and eat and blow the hair


Deduction items:

The soundproofing of the hotel room is very poor, and I was uncomfortable the day I went. I slept in the hotel all afternoon, and the sound of people coming and going in the corridor was clear, and I fell asleep.

The balcony view of the hotel is very limited. We booked a double bed room with lake view. During the National Day 1800+/night, the staff said that our balcony view is the best in the hotel. After seeing it, I was very disappointed and just happened to be able to see it. The drain is dirty

There are many people who go to the hotel for breakfast after 9 o'clock. Watching the staff clean up the table, they just wipe the placemats with a rag that has wiped the food, and then start to set the tableware. There is no new placemat, which is very unhygienic! Worry service level

Barbecue business is relatively informal, the staff handwritten + calculations at the time of checkout, more than 100 barbecues charged us more than 200, we found that there was a problem in the checkout and went back and recalculated. After we told the staff, he said you eat it; the level of barbecue is also relatively poor, and the grill is terrible

msg:During the Mid-Autumn Festival holiday to play in the beautiful town of Qiandao Lake, staying in Bright is full of rewards. The hotel is not far from the city. It is located in the core of the central lake area of Qiandao Lake. It takes about ten minutes by car to arrive. The picturesque scenery along the way is adjacent to Qiandao Lake. When you check in, the hotel I was upgraded to a lake-view room with a pleasant view. Thank you for the hotel’s thoughtful arrangements. The hotel staff are warm and thoughtful. From the security uncle to the management, they are all professional. Special thanks to Yu Feiqin, Xiaohe, Xiaowu at the front desk, as well as those who opened the view. Handsome guy, forgot what his name was! Attentive service, responsive! (It's a very beautiful young lady~) I will choose this hotel next time I come to Qiandao Lake!

Leisure chair, you can look at the lake and water in the distance when you hold a teacup in your hand, it is a pleasant experience! We stayed in two big and one small, twin beds, one bed per person (hahaha...I sleep on a sofa, because the hotel is decorated in a new Chinese style, and the sofa is a Luohan bed, which is quite spacious and comfortable!) I paid an extra bed fee of 200, hahaha... and the butler Xiaohe was very considerate. He gave us a detailed introduction to the hotel while sending us to the room. Originally, the room type was booked with double breakfast. Please inform registered hotel members that you can send us a copy. The breakfast worth 68 yuan, plus the hotel buffet we want to eat in the evening is also a three-person set coupon recommended by Xiaohe, which is 70 yuan cheaper than Meituan, anyway, the service is great! The breakfast is also very rich, it is our favorite taste! Anyway, five-star is really fragrant! Next time I will bring my family with me. Oh! There is also the hotel’s open-air swimming pool, which is great! When I started choosing a hotel, I took a fancy to the hotel’s swimming pool👍👍

The butler Xiaohe helped check in, helped carry luggage, delivered to the room and also introduced the hotel related matters and helped book the location for dinner. It’s so considerate. Special thanks to Miss Fang Yating, who explained to me in detail the children’s play area in the hotel. There are pottery crafts in the hotel, there are two playgrounds, there are outdoor swimming pools, there are bathing places, and movies and video games, which are self-contained for children. Paradise, kids don’t want to leave anymore. In the morning, I rented an electric bicycle for 4 people. You can see the beautiful scenery of Qiandao Lake along the bicycle path outside the hotel. We have been riding for nearly 3 hours, and our mood has become more relaxed with the lake breeze and the mountains. There are rest places in the hotel, both indoors and outdoors. There are also free books to read indoors. The place is also very large. Outdoors can directly see Qiandao Lake. The location is also great. It is the first time to write so many. This is the most satisfying stay of the trip, and I will come back again if I want to rest in the future.

msg:I went to the hotel where I stayed on Sunday. Before I went, I was a bit worried about the comments of some people. I remember that I also called Ctrip's customer service to communicate. The experience of this trip is actually pretty good, five-star worthy. This is a very satisfying trip.
1 Location: Compared to other hotels, Bright feels a bit hidden from the world, and it is a bit remote to be simple. It is 3.7 kilometers away from food stalls and fish street, and more than 2 kilometers away from the pier.
2 Hotel environment: There are two parking lots, one above ground and one underground. Parking is free. The hotel is built on the peninsula. The environment is as shown in the picture. It is pretty good. There are many electric cars in the hotel. The service staff I met this time were very enthusiastic. There are fewer supporting facilities nearby and it is more convenient to drive by car.
3 Hotel facilities: There is a large outdoor swimming pool and a large indoor swimming pool. There are not many people going on weekends, which is very cool. There is a small playground.
4 Hotel service: Hahaha, the room was upgraded, and the lake view double room on the 5th floor was upgraded, but the lake view is not particularly good. The receptionist at the front desk was trained and very enthusiastic. A butler service was also arranged. The butler Xiao Zeng was very enthusiastic and the service was very good.
5 Buffet restaurant: The weekend buffet for two is only 198, the price is very nice, and it is delicious. At that time, I wanted to eat Qiandao Lake fish head with my baby. I bought a weekend buffet for two people because of laziness and a bit too biased. However, it was very cheap and only 198 for two people. (The picture I bought is at the end of the picture. It was from someone else's. To come), there are more than two hundred meals for three people, which seems to be cheaper per person. Lamb steak and scallops in the buffet, there are also limited edition Xiaoqinglong that day, the chef is super good, the little brother who has a grilled lamb chops smiles very well, the key is that the lamb chops are delicious, and the savory and durian pie bread is highly recommended for breakfast . In terms of restaurant service, as the comments said, it is quite cold, and all services need to be mentioned. You can also order your own food at the hotel. This time, I ordered Sanxian fried noodles for supper. The amount is quite large, and there is a lot of meat inside.
6 Check in the room: The facilities in the room are quite new, and the room has forgotten to take pictures. Welcome fruit was delivered when checking in. The hotel does not take the initiative to provide disposable toothbrush sets and slippers, so please tell the hotel. It is worth mentioning that the quality of his disposable slippers is really good. I have stayed in many five-star hotels and they are considered good.

The hotel provides a buffet with many varieties. There is not much to eat around. The Chinese restaurant on the 2nd floor of the hotel can provide it, and there is a set menu or a separate order.
The hotel is only about 3 kilometers away from the central lake area. We walked around. It was easy to find the pier after walking along the green cycling path.

There will be different scenery at different times of the day, but they are all the beauty that can still be remembered for a long time. There are two types of parking lots, underground and above ground, but it is recommended to park in the underground space with a lot of large parking spaces, and it is relatively cool. There are many types of breakfast, and the taste is good. At first, I was worried that the food in the south should be lighter. I brought pickled vegetables. I didn't expect the taste of the meal to be good so the pickles were not opened. The only thing that is not convenient for the hotel is to order takeaways, because they are all located in the scenic area. The topography is relatively high. The restaurants are below. The takeaways are basically delivered from 100 yuan. It takes at least an hour to deliver, and they are all fish. It's greasy.

msg:The hotel environment is very good, the scenery from the viewing platform is great, and the service staff are very enthusiastic. The only drawback is that the outdoor swimming pool is not open in such hot weather, and the indoor swimming pool is closed at 8pm, so that the hotel guests have no place to go at night. Hope to improve.

msg:The dust on the coffee table is very thick, the floor on the balcony is broken and there is no hint that you almost plug your feet. I booked the place for dinner in advance. I didn’t like it very much. I asked the waiter if I could change the waiter. Loudly blamed there is no place to change the order. Two breakfasts in a twin room although I stayed alone. The waiter did tell you that you can only eat the snacks delivered in the room once, and did not deliver the fruit banana or it was rotten because it is close to the scenery. There are a lot of mosquitoes and there are no electric mosquito coils. The clothes cabinet should also be modified so that it cannot be closed and needs to be ironed. I borrowed clothes from ironing clothes and gave me a bad harvest scald pack. The spout for boiling water couldn't be inserted at all. It is prone to electrical safety hazards. The most important point is that all shower gels, shampoos, conditioners, hand sanitizers, body lotions have a shelf life of two years. There is no production date. The only one with a production date is also expired for half a year. For me with sensitive skin, I have a successful allergy.

Next to our meal is the children’s playground. The children are playing by themselves, and the adults are much more relaxed.

msg:Suppress first and then raise, there are praise and derogation.
Advantage:
1. The location is very good and the natural environment is very good. It is far away from the downtown and commercial places, but it is not far to the town. It is not as difficult to take a taxi as imagined, and it is also cheap. But Didi really doesn’t have any cars when it’s too late at night
2. The facilities are comprehensive and functional, which is fully in line with domestic holiday habits and consumption habits. Even KTV machines, claw machines, children's play, massage chairs, self-service beverage machines, cinemas, hot springs, swimming pools, gyms, restaurants, everything
3. Room space is reasonable, not small, double beds can also be put together
4. There is a balcony for viewing, and the room also has a small refrigerator, instant noodles, and drinks
5. Sanitation and cleaning are good, and the front desk and other staff are good, but not perfect, there is room for improvement
6. Soundproofing is OK, sleeping in the room is quite quiet
7. The taste of room delivery is also ok, although there are not many choices
8. Breakfast is a little bit past the effective time or enter, which is very user-friendly
9. The pillows are soft or hard, so consider it very thoughtful
10. There is a Starbucks in the lobby of the hotel, with the most basic types of coffee, and the prices are lower than those in the market. There is also a bar with a variety of wines to choose from.

insufficient:
1. Before booking, I saw the hotel policy saying that the outdoor swimming pool is open. After arriving at the hotel, I was told that it would not be open because the temperature was not high, so I was very disappointed. Because this is the most important point when I book this hotel. Now it’s 32 degrees and it’s scorched and told me that it’s not hot enough. This is an excuse. If you know in advance that it is not open, you will definitely not choose this hotel.
2. The gym is very small. There are only a few barbells without equipment. You need to bring your own elastic band or portable equipment when you go out. There are a few treadmills/bikes for aerobics, nothing more. The most important thing is that there is no mirror! Used towels are left everywhere, no one collects them, the water/sweat from the bicycle is spilled on the floor, and there are two glasses of drinking water left. There are tables and chairs outside the gym. Who goes to the gym to see the scenery? It is better to remove and put on the yoga mat. The design of this gym is too tasteless.
3. The restaurant will not be open after one o'clock in the afternoon, which does not match the complete hardware facilities, so it is still not possible to rely on the hotel to achieve one-stop service.
4. The restaurant has only forks and no knives. Breakfast is very Chinese to be honest, and Westerners can barely eat
5. There is a beautiful lake view inside the hotel, but there is a lot of rubbish, which is a bit of a failure
6. Outside the lobby, there is an outdoor dining service, as well as speaker projections. Group meals are understandable, but too loud music can affect others. Booking this hotel is nothing more than enjoying the beautiful scenery and enjoying the quiet. Loud music is not everyone's favorite. When I went back in the evening, there was an uncle watching TV alone with a loud volume, and he was speechless.
7. Toiletries are average, they don’t smell or foam, so I suggest you bring them with you.
8. The balcony of the room with a view is a thick gray wall. Such a beautiful view is actually blocked. If it is made of transparent glass or an iron fence, it would be great.
overall evaluation:
* The price of more than 400 on weekdays is very good and it is worth staying
* The price of more than 700 holidays is acceptable, but I will look forward to more improvements in all aspects of management
* It is suitable for the living habits and consumption methods of domestic tourists. Although there is an open attitude to receive foreign tourists, the details are not available, such as Chinese breakfast, no knife, gym design, etc. The number of foreign tourists during the stay for a few nights is quite large. Taking care of the living habits of foreigners will greatly improve the international reputation.
* Regardless of management, the hotel is still very quiet, with a good environment and comprehensive facilities. Although the facilities are not up-to-date (the toilet is an old-fashioned basic model), the quality is still not damaged.
* The environment and hardware are very good, service and management need to be improved. If it catches up with the management/service quality of foreign chains, the hotel will become a luxury hotel, now it is considered a high-end hotel.
Suggestions to readers:
1. There is a lake-view restaurant near the hotel. You don't need to go to a noisy place in the town. People search for "Xiaofang Farm".
2. You can use Didi to take a taxi. Don't believe the taxi master said that you can't take a taxi. You can leave your contact information as a backup plan.
3. Nearby bar: Drunken Island whisky cocktail bar

msg:Before I came to Qiandao Lake, I selected a few more distinctive hotels on Ctrip and were hesitant, but in the end I successfully booked the Qiandao Lake Bright Resort. The facts proved that my choice was a wise move. First of all, I feel very satisfied with the hotel's dining, leisure and accommodation environment. Secondly, this resort hotel opened halfway up the mountain is unscrupulous because of its scenery, cultural a**osphere, service and environmental sanitation. The hotel’s breakfast is rich in variety, delicious, and healthy. The restaurant staff feels very comfortable when they see the cosmopolitan greet the dining environment! In addition, I would like to thank the hotel for providing room upgrade butler Xiaohua’s service and being polite. I also added my WeChat account. The problems that were reflected during my stay were also resolved in time. This is very precious. All in all, the Thousand Island Lake Bright Resort Hotel is really great, and it is very nice to make guests feel at home. Next time you come to Qiandao Lake for a holiday, choose it.

msg:I didn't want to comment, so I didn't take any photos? But the overall experience of staying here is not good. We go to Qiandao Lake almost 2-3 times a year, and have stayed in most five-star hotels. It can be said that this is the worst experience I have ever stayed in. When entering the room, there is a strong musty smell. You can see the severe mold on the walls. Because I checked in late, I didn't change the room. I turned on the purifier and went to bed after the smell got better. When I was sleeping, I found that the quilt was stained with blood, which was the first time I encountered it in a hotel. In the middle of the night, my daughter coughed because of the musty smell in the room. In the morning, the child asked the front desk if he could give her a small toy, because the hotel would prepare it for the child when he stayed in the hotel before, but the front desk answered no indifferently, and then gave her two mints there... On the way back, the housekeeper came to ask Experience, I also said my feelings. The hotel said that it must send me special products to apologize. I shied away for a long time, and they expressed the hope that I would not give a bad review, and gave them the address to make them feel at ease. In the end, I received a courier with pay on delivery... Although it is a trivial matter, the intertwining of many things shows that the hotel's service management is very problematic

msg:先説優點：辦入住會有管家加微信，小胡和餘多多兩個管家都添加了。

不知道是不是因為酒店也覺得五一節假日房價溢價嚴重，但服務跟不上，為了多增添人文關懷感受避免攜程差評才安排的管家。小胡回覆信息很及時，兩位該提醒的也都有做到，退房還準備了禮物，兩個大紙皮帶裏面裝了幾個小玩意兒，小朋友玩的，可惜我們一家人沒有小朋友，架勢很大，顯得禮物很小氣，其實也是一點心意就這樣安慰自己吧。

800多的房費額外還補了600訂了湖景的雙床，兩間房間加上零頭差不多3000塊錢，不便宜。退房的時候我家人不知道mini吧收費拿了mini吧的一瓶旺仔牛奶和雪碧想上島喝，結果退房管家還問我要20塊錢，我想説的是房價這麼貴，兩瓶飲料是不是不用表現的這麼小氣，跟管家溝通説我們還要回酒店的，到時候補給他們，然後就説申請給我們免簽，希望給個好評，下次訂房有優惠，可是住了一次不會想再住了。其實搞這麼一出體驗感已經不太好了，並不會感激給好評，本來一個小瓶的旺仔和雪碧也不貴。

説説入住的時候，我們早上怕堵車，從6點就出門從寧波自駕到千島湖，到酒店已經很疲憊了，酒店告知沒房要到下午兩點，我和酒店説明瞭我們的情況，表示願意等，希望可以起碼能儘快出一間房讓我們能夠休息，另外一間晚一點也沒事，前台説沒房，衹能等下午兩點，後來陸續來了兩位在看情況，然後就説可以兩間都給了，首先還是感謝，但是這時候我是很納悶的，不是説沒房嗎，現在又可以給了。不知道是什麼操作，是不是遇到不會爭取的客人就要從上午在酒店大堂坐到下午才可以呢。

入住了，房間設施也挺舊的了，湖景衹能看到一個灣灣，陽台沒啥私隱也不安靜，因為酒店是環形的吧，陽台上能看到其他房間的人，還有一個小孩兒在大喊大叫跟她家長崩潰的吵架，把我搞得也已經很崩潰了因為我們在休息。去中餐廳用午餐，伯瑞特官方小程序買的套餐前台都不知道是啥，找了幾個人問，早餐也沒有啥服務，沒有領位，服務員都不太專業，按理説是按五星級標準來操作的話不應該這樣。康樂中心是個活動都要額外付費，酒店的節日活動也很潦草……唉，總的來説我覺得槽點太多了，説不完。入住體驗就是花了幾千塊錢睡了一覺而已。好不容易帶家人出去玩住酒店，都這麼貴的服務還這樣的話，應該多加幾百塊錢去住喜來登的。

msg:關於房間：訂的是湖景恐龍親子房，五一訂得匆忙，沒有仔細看別人的評論，光看了圖片，想當然的以為有陽台、有浴缸，實際上是沒有陽台、沒有浴缸的哦。湖景準確的説應該是小河景，並不是那種開闊的湖景。另外，房間設施也比較陳舊，有一股味道，可能是因為離湖較近比較潮濕的原因。第二天，開了一整天的窗户，味道有所緩解。
關於酒店環境：酒店並不是位於縣城中心，所以比較安靜，風景也很不錯，有户外游泳池、室內游泳池。早餐也比較豐盛，但五一期間高峯時間段用餐人數會較多。
關於服務：人還在上海，酒店管家小陳就已經聯繫了，之後全程跟進，耐心細心，為整個酒店的印象拉分不少。其他工作人員服務也不錯，包括開小車的師傅、餐廳服務員等等。
總體評價：酒店環境好、安靜、自然；酒店服務好；湖景恐龍親子房設施陳舊，略有失望。

來了以後除了設施舊一點，房間封閉的時候有點潮氣，畢竟最近雨季
其他從衞生和服務來説，都是超預期
尤其是超級可愛的小陳管家

超級感動

首先性價比挺高的，泳池有室內室外的，還有康樂中心，在餐廳處有小童玩樂設施。在酒店的大堂也設定了小童畫畫之類的。還有松鼠樂園，可以和小松鼠互動。另外還有温湯，但現在去未開放。
房間中規中矩吧，開業有點年數了，有些設備都存在老化。
早餐挺豐盛的，但是規劃可以在合理點，也看得出酒店在與時俱進，在親子項目上也是的。
酒店挺大的，我認為可以在辦理入住的時候或者在房間裏放個宣傳冊，告知酒店的活動項目以及觀景台的方位等等。

我是自駕到的，到了以後酒店整得非常大，酒店獨立佔據一塊區域，不是那種很多酒店混在一起的，這點體驗很不錯，居住的房型業和我定的房間的示例圖完全一樣，房間還有陽台，能看到一些湖景，室外還有晾衣架（派上大用了，住了好幾天洗了衣服有地方晾衣服。）
私人管家朵朵還貼心的提醒了用餐地點，泳池地點，當時我們到是下午了15點了，已經過了酒店午餐時間，朵朵還告知我們可以去魚街吃飯，真的很貼心，期間還幫忙給我娃準備了小童洗漱用品，這點感受很棒！
酒店去中心湖島的登船地方很近，酒店還可以租自行車和電瓶車（自行車可以調整坐墊高低，大童能騎）。
酒店室內泳池很棒！小朋友遊得很開心，還有個室外泳池，可惜我們行程太滿沒體驗到。
整體這個4天3晚的旅程大人很滿意，小朋友也很開心😁

2. 酒店知道後幫忙換了房間，並且幫忙延遲了退房時間，服務態度還是很好的，
3. 酒店的早餐花樣很多，但是味道真的一般。這個不怪酒店，千島湖呆了3天，沒有吃到過任何覺得好吃的東西，杭州不愧美食荒漠，沒啥説的。

早餐：挺豐富的，中式、西式、點心都有，還能自製華夫餅雞蛋仔，9點45分去吃也還有很多東西，不像以前去的酒店，臨近收餐，就不補菜了。
服務：辦理入住的時候人挺多，前廳部也蠻專業的，速度很快，就是這個自助機子，我以為也可以直接辦，沒想到是需要在人工那兒先操作好再找自助，不知道什麼情況，多排了一次隊，下次希望可以有文字指示指引。
環境：游泳池戲水池那兒真不錯，兒子第一次下水，可以選擇較淺的水池，水質很好很乾凈，幾乎沒有雜質，我去的時候人也不多，特別好，不喜歡下餃子的感覺。不過這個康樂中心確實有點迷你，米蘭餐廳邊上還有個玩泡泡球的地方。我覺得地下車庫得弄的亮堂點，看不太清指示標誌，哪裡是電梯入口處，而且出電梯右邊就是清洗布草的洗衣房還是什麼的，大門敞開，看起來不太雅觀。

酒店大堂前停車挺亂，找不到車位。衹能停到路口處的地下停車庫。停車庫到大堂還需要走一段室外的路。（很熱）至少這一點停車上來説就不太方便了。拿到房卡後還得坐小車去客房部，又覺得不方便了。進去你得稍微等一下才有車。想出來又得打電話提前跟他們説。或者直接走路吧，也就兩百米。
入住後發現房間小，沙發臟有印記。這個價格比預想中差很多很多（雖然是週末的價格）。前一天附近的（伊敦度假酒店，而且價格在1000內，還給你免費升級到了套房）對比，真的差很多。位置對於想外賣的人來説有點遠了。拿到燒烤之類的基本冷了。
有點尷尬的一點。第一天在伊敦1000內（超出想象了一點），想着第二天住伯瑞1300+更好一點。結果 很失望。但是一點，伯瑞特酒店內的自助晚餐118元很划算。海鮮還可以……

msg:長差評，給不想看完的人總結：
1.致電説可以直接前台用599dy價預訂，到了説賣完了衹能1600定
2.自助餐關了，衹剩巨貴又很爛的中餐廳（魚內臟未清除乾淨）
3.xc定的房間不帶温泉，披着浴袍冰冰涼跑過去被告知要不交79一個人不然不給
4.房間沒浴袍，洗澡水温不穩定會燙人

衹能説來了好幾次了，見證了這個酒店一次比一次差。這麼好的地理位置經營逐漸退步真的非常佩服酒店的管理。

從dy599兩室獨棟套餐來的，打電話確認當天在前台也可以用**價直接預訂，但是到達後告知套餐售罄，兩室獨棟衹能原價1600買。別和我説房型不一樣，都是兩室獨棟能有多大區別？不願意給優惠可以直説而且事先電話告知可以當場dy價定。

前台根本不解決問題也全程沒表達電話裏説可以dy價定現在又説訂完的歉意，讓我們去找預訂部的人諮詢，你就不能讓預訂部的人過來嗎？有基本的服務意識嗎？

被逼無奈直接在xc上定了兩間388的雙人間，這是我第一個定過的以温泉為一大賣點還有預訂不帶温泉的酒店。而且帶温泉的房間在xc上衹貴15塊的樣子，我們都在問前台温泉開到幾點了那肯定是要去的，我們當著前台的麪定的前台也沒提醒我們要定這個貴15塊的才有温泉，害得我們披着浴袍冷冰冰跑過去被温泉看門的趕回去，也不幫我們解決問題直接問我們收一個人78，四個人就是300多，就一個這麼小的破人工温泉你怎麼不去搶啊？

最後一點也是最無語的，本來是衝著自助餐來的，這個酒店一開始自助餐100多一個人吃的很不錯現在好傢伙元旦假期直接把自助餐關了，讓我們去吃中餐廳，中餐廳的菜貴的離譜且非常一般能收出五星級的價格，一盆最便宜的蔬菜40多，包頭魚頭賣368菜單前幾頁就沒有100以下的菜，上來的魚內臟都沒挖乾淨還有殘留的內臟味

定的兩間房其中一間房沒有浴袍可見客房服務也是非常的專業以至於這種基本錯誤都會犯，並且洗澡水的温度非常不穩定被燙到了好幾次，洗了一半會突然變得很燙很燙。

最後，這是最後一次去這家酒店。

對客服務標準高👍管理贊👍員工態度意識非常棒👍
謝謝我們的管家小姐姐。我們的火車是當天晚上比較晚到千島湖站，酒店離車站有30公里左右，我們還在想呢，是租車還是打車去，酒店的工作人員就打來電話詢問到店時間，並且説是我們的管家，任何事情都可以找她。後面2天，我們感受到了這句承諾的重量。無論是臨時包車接站、當晚推薦旅遊項目、關鍵時間出現的恰到好處的提供幫助。主打的就是一個，我安靜的在旁邊不打擾，但是你需要的時候，在你開口之前我就在的感覺，水平很高👍
感謝接站大叔。善良質樸、熱情周到。
感謝旅遊顧問的小姐姐。22:00了都加我微信瞭解需求。
感謝交通車大叔。開電瓶車送到我們住的樓下後，幫我們打開門禁、送上電梯，並且提醒了注意事項後才離開。
感謝中餐廳的服務小姐姐。推薦的菜品和數量恰到好處，我們剛剛光盤。
總之，這次行程很驚喜，我們看到的每一個員工都是熱情、愉悦、為客着想的，這很難得。給管理層點個贊、給服務我們的工作人員點個贊。
下次再去千島湖，一定會再住這家酒店的。

然後就是小童樂園了，不用太期待，一個幾十個平方的小房間，真的沒什麼玩頭
游泳池還可以吧，衹能説還可以
衞生阿姨態度非常好也很熱情，問什麼都會熱心解答，前台就很糟糕了，幾組客户辦理入住居然能等小一個小時，匪夷所思

再另外表揚幾個優點：我本來是買了一個三天兩晚湖景房套餐+單獨定了一晚庭院房（就是點評的這個），辦入住時酒店就主動offer我原房續住，後來因為湖景房都賣出去了又幫我升級到了別墅房，單獨帶兩娃出遊的老母親真的有感覺到善意和關懷。早餐非常豐盛好吃時間長。泳池區的救生員認真負責，租泳圈什麼的也不貴。
缺點的話，離鎮中心略遠，附近沒啥好吃的，不過叫車挺容易的。擺渡車有時候要等。

msg:每次去千島湖都去別的酒店。原來酒店因為訂不到房間了，才訂這酒店。該酒店是第一次去，位置不錯，曲徑通幽的。大廳還大氣通透。
到酒店，前台免費提升了房間。這感覺不錯。酒店早飯可以。可西餐廳、中餐廳感覺閉塞，更見不到湖，感覺不足。
可能是位置環境關係，我們2個房間特別是床上都有黴味。房間是4樓，若底層的可能會更明顯。

11月份的天氣，晚上很陰冷的，開了熱空調卻沒有熱風，被告知中央空調還沒有開熱空調，因為酒店方覺得現在天氣還熱，？沒錯就是這麼離譜。對了，朝北房間很潮一直有一股黴味。我也不理解那麼多朝南的空房間為什麼安排我們朝南的，可能是因為便宜？看我們好欺負？
早餐的盤子非常臟，我連續兩天都拿到佈滿油的盤子，大家用之前一定要仔細看看，真的很噁心。現在還有盤子都洗不乾淨的餐廳，真的很少見。
還有那個中餐廳，吃到了已經風乾成牛肉乾的牛肋排，肯定放了很長時間了，整盤牛肉基本都是咬不動的，很久沒有吃到這麼噁心的食物了。要不是附近沒有飯店，誰會來這裏吃？
住酒店温泉半價，一個人64，但衹有三個池子，如果是衝著温泉來的可以直接不用考慮了，特地去買了泳衣的我就像一個小丑，還有客人在池子裏抽煙，沒人管的。池子也很敷衍，水也不乾淨。
這次唯一覺得好的地方每天的免費核酸，除此之外，沒有什麼好的體驗，其他的我也能理解，但食品安全問題真的無法原諒。酒店那麼多，為什麼偏偏選了這個，疫情期間出來玩不容易，拿什麼來還我們這幾天的好心情？

衞生間的推拉門不太順滑，而且門合不上
門口上方的空調機有異響，叫師傅修過之後，仍舊響，但是在不易察覺的範圍內
雖然酒店配置算是豪華級，泳池挺好，娛樂設施也多樣很適合親子游，早飯還不錯，但是節假日人太多，餐廳爆滿，沒位子坐
但是房間細節還需要加油

環境：環境整體還不錯！
雙人温湯:給了2個人的温湯票，我們家3個人，不知給誰去？所以放棄了
早餐:最可笑的是早餐，9點不到去的，結果餐廳門口人山人海，要拿號才能進，10點餐飲就結束，9:45還有很多人排隊，你們讓人吃飯嗎？
總之 以後不會去住這個酒店了，客氣一點，也不給差評，但是我是不滿意的！

前台小哥哥貼心的給升級了湖景房，大飄窗正對着千島湖美景，一邊在浴缸裏泡着澡一邊盡覽湖光山色，享受！

升級了親子房，更大一些，送了温泉券，還有貼心的微信管家
下次來千島湖，還會選擇～

msg:衞生：衞生情況屬於中等，不好不壞。
環境：湖景房景觀還算可以，周圍比較偏，沒有超市飯店，但是環境不錯。
服務：服務一般，禮賓車送錯了門，到了門口阿姨還在打掃衞生，酒店的魚頭湯和燒烤一般，但是自助早餐和啤酒很不錯。服務人員培訓不是很到位，很多人一問三不知，解決問題的能力有待提高。
設施：設施舊了一點，裝修風格不是很高檔，一千六一晚的酒店居然沒有浴室，而且房間的飲料品種也少，而且居然要收費。

msg:服務非常差，去之前打電話詢問最新的防疫政策，客服完全搞不清楚，最後還是我們自己打給防疫辦詢問。
前台入住體驗差，酒店規定下午2點後入住，4點不到到酒店客房還沒有準備好，需在大堂等待房間打掃完畢。
客房設施老舊，房間一進去就能感覺到很潮濕，廁所無排風，更無除濕系統。
接駁服務差，由於酒店比較大，有客房接駁服務，打電話預訂接駁服務總是要等很久。
唯一感到不錯的是酒店的室外泳池，人不是很多，體驗不錯。
總而言之，訂之前以為是一家高檔型酒店，入住後體檢不是很好，下次再去千島湖不會再住了，會試試其他品牌。

順便提一下小管家的名字叫（小華）的名字，服務非常好，休息了下，晚上還可以泡温泉，這個酒店最滿意的是有汽車充電樁。住起來太舒服了，11月16又續住一晚，11月17日，回杭州繼續工作，需要度假的強烈推薦！非常放鬆的度假模式！

千島湖基本每年都會來，不逛景點，泡在酒店的話，這家算是不錯的選擇。

msg:這是在千島湖住的第二個酒店，想着換個酒店換換心情，當天遇到預訂的景觀雙層，到達酒店後得知沒有湖景，於是在前台加了四百換成了別墅區的一室一廳，説是風景會好些，有私人管家小華幫忙拿東西，説實話感覺管家比前台更熱情，後來看了**發現衹要1100多一晚，我現場補要1400，瞬間心情low了很多，房間格局佈置沒話講，但是！蟲子多的嚇死你，一進門就是一衹大蜘蛛，陽台幾乎沒什麼用因為蟲子太多根本不敢出去，住了一天打死了六七衹蟲子，蜘蛛啊多腳爬蟲差點嚇死我，小孩子又喜歡光腳在地上，浴缸套收費，想想確實不應該升級，床也小，一家三口睡擠的慌，三個人一晚上翻來覆去沒睡好。再來説服務，我們下午去了室外泳池，那時候還有太陽室外人很少，我老公就帶着孩子在小童泳池的最邊上找個陰涼處打水槍，我給孩子穿了洞洞鞋是乾淨的，專門玩水才帶來的，有個救生衣之類的就一直在我們邊上監視一樣的，説不可以把鞋子穿進去，我説我們不游泳，就站在邊上打水槍，他還説讓我們帶着孩子去游泳，拜託小孩才2歲誒他衹會打水槍啊，當時那裡衹有我們一家人沒有影響任何人，他們就一直站在邊上看着，我真的氣死，花錢來度假搞得一肚子氣。除了這個別的服務員態度基本上還是好的。餐飲的話衹吃了早餐，中規中矩吧，晚餐去的開元自助，沒在這裏吃因為網上沒看到什麼評價，本身酒店是有中西餐的。
最後總結一句，感覺這個酒店很努力的想要往高級酒店靠近，但設施，服務，衞生各方面都還欠缺，甚至有點點影響我後期旅行的心情，住過江浙滬太多親子酒店，像森泊我反覆去了五次了，好我肯定會説好，不好我也會説不好，本來第一晚是在另一家酒店覺得蠻不錯才決定多玩一天的，結果衹能説差強人意，也許是房間選錯了，也許是期待值過高，反正應該不會再來了。

先説入住，混亂的不行，沒有條理，速度慢。因為第二晚不是湖景，服務員説200可以升級，或者購買168月餅禮盒，月餅一般
再説房間，還算乾淨，但是view真的不是很開闊，服務員説這已經是最好的房間了
最後説吃飯，真的是差的不行，太差了，不管是早餐還是中餐廳，不推薦吃
