The breakfast was ok but I cannot say it was extraordinary. something usual which you can find everywhere in every hotel. The reception and other guys working here were really good-behaved and treating well. As a whole, this hotel seems really great in Shenyang. Since I was in other hotels and places before in shenyang, in comparion with those ones, Conrad Hilton seems to be a good choice of stay. you can find malls and numerous restaurants around easily

msg:Great experience; appreciate the warm hospitality from everyone, from concierge to front office, housekeeping to restaurant and lounge. Also loved the stunning bird’s eye view of Shenyang and the cozy night view in the evening!!

Only one slight disappointment: the hotel doesn’t have any international sockets (albeit being an international brand - not sure if that’s the norm in China though). Plus-point was when the call centre staff took the initiative to send their concierge member to buy an adapter for me when I called them and was told that they didn’t have any adapters available in the hotel at that point in time to lend me. Really appreciated the initiative. Though the concierge member brought the wrong type of adapter (China to UK instead UK to China - thought that should be at least commonsensical for someone working in an international brand); and he was slightly unpleasant to deal with when he demanded for payment for the adaptor even though the wrong type was bought. He was also hesitant to escalate the issue to the duty manager at first until I really insisted.

Duty manager resolved the issue seamlessly, took the initiative to bring one from their office and sent all the way to my room - again appreciate it.

Overall, great environment and professional but warm hospitality. All other concierge members were also extremely helpful! Jacky also took initiative to send me a GPS location of the nearby police post when I needed to settle some documents there.

It's extremely convenient to go anywhere. The room is very large, the bedding is very comfortable, and the breakfast is more abundant. Seeing that we have children, the guy at the front desk, Wiley Wang, not only has a good service attitude, but also provides a special breakfast for children. Thank you very much! During our stay, we visited the executive lounge three times and received warm hospitality and service from three beautiful ladies: Luna Li, Sarah Jiao, and Cloris. Thank you very much! The lounge environment is also first-class, suitable not only for business but also for families to relax and enjoy the scenery. The afternoon tea snacks and happy hour dinner are both exquisite and taste good. If I have another chance to go to Shenyang next time, I will still stay here, it’s great!

We checked into a room on the executive floor where we could see the sunrise~ We checked the sunrise time and set the alarm clock. The sight of opening the curtains to see the sunrise was very touching. It was really happy to take two pictures and continue sleeping!
The hotel matches Conrad's service standards. From check-in to breakfast to the executive lounge, the service staff are courteous and attentive!
The breakfast room was full that day and the breakfast room was very busy, but Lisa was still very considerate. Seeing her as the manager personally collecting the tables and pushing the dining cart, I wanted to give it a big thumbs up! With such a dedicated leader leading the team, the team must be outstanding!

The location of the hotel is also very good, Hang Lung is just downstairs
The hotel is also very cost-effective, cheaper than the Conrad in Shanghai.
All in all the experience was great! If I go to Shenyang again, I will choose to stay here again!

Environment: In the center of Shenyang, overlooking the Forbidden City. The height of the room is unexpected, spacious and comfortable, and the decoration is very careful and combines modern and classic styles perfectly.

Hygiene: The linen has texture and is overall good! But there is one very big regret. There is a bunch of brown hair collected on the black floor of the shower. It is probably that the cleaning staff forgot about it. Such a mistake should not be done! I can't give full marks for this.
There are many varieties of breakfast, and the view from the 88th floor is a rare environment.
I will choose Conrad again in the future.

The lobby on the first floor has a novel and elegant design style and a lot of artworks. It only takes a few dozen seconds to take the high-speed elevator to the 88th floor. Because the check-in time was relatively early, I checked in smoothly without queuing. The room is fully equipped and the bathroom is very clean. The temperature and humidity in the room are very suitable. There are also welcome fruits after check-in. I had the hotel's breakfast before checking out the next day. It was delicious and rich in variety. When checking out, Wiley at the front desk enthusiastically asked about the check-in experience, gave a small gift, and helped store luggage. I will choose Conrad next time I come to Shenyang!

Ms. Liu, the manager on duty at the front desk, met my needs for a room in a timely manner after understanding my needs for a room, and also gave me many surrounding travel introductions and travel guides. The young lady is very beautiful and has a beautiful smile😄Thank you Ms. Liu for creating a perfect stay experience for me🥹The room area is also larger than that of ordinary hotels, and the high-floor facilities are excellent! Overlooking the entire Shenyang! The hygiene aspect is also good! Breakfast may need to be improved a bit, the variety is a bit lacking. Overall, Conrad Shenyang is worth checking out and I hope to stay here again in the near future! Once again, I would like to commend Ms. Liu in real name! thanks for your help!

First of all, in terms of hygiene, as soon as you enter the hotel, you can feel that the hotel decoration is high-end, clean and tidy, the guest rooms are spacious and bright, the room layout is reasonable and comfortable, the bathroom is large, and there is a large bathtub. You can take a bath at night and see the most beautiful night view of Shenyang.
In terms of service, the concierge and front desk reception services are very good. They can take the initiative to help with luggage and guide the elevator to the front desk for check-in. The front desk staff has a very good attitude and the check-in procedure is also very fast. After arriving at the guest room, the guest room staff Sister Shao and the supervisor Wang Yu's service is very considerate. He cleans the room every day and provides me with many personalized services according to my needs.

In short, I will basically choose Conrad Shenyang every time I come to Shenyang. It has the highest view in Shenyang, the best service level, and the cleanest guest rooms. It makes me feel more friendly every time I stay. It is the first time I stay in Shenyang. The hotel of choice.

msg:It was my first time to visit Shenyang. I made many comparisons online and finally chose Conrad Shenyang. The first reason is that the location and facilities stand out among the hotels in Shenyang. The second reason is that there are many good reviews online. It is said that Conrad is ranked No. 1 in Asia. Before checking into the hotel, I received a call from the hotel staff asking me about my preferences and needs for the room, which made me look forward to this stay even more.
The hotel is located above the Plaza 66 in Shenyang City. As soon as I arrived on the first floor of the hotel, the concierge guy opened the car door for me, took my luggage, and guided me to the elevator. He was very enthusiastic. The hotel's lobby is located on the 88th floor. There are windows next to the check-in desk, and you can see the entire Shenyang scenery. When checking in, Wiley at the front desk arranged the room according to my prior needs, and enthusiastically asked me about the purpose of my trip, and recommended many surrounding tourist attractions and famous local restaurants for me. This is really helpful to me, because this trip is relatively short, and when I was doing a guide online, I saw a lot of restaurant recommendations, and I was afraid of stepping on something wrong. Wiley’s recommendation made my choice much easier. After arriving in the room, the room was prepared exactly according to my requirements. I am very satisfied. I like the heated towel rack, which is very practical. The housekeeping aunt is also very serious about cleaning the room. Since I traveled a lot, I didn't get to experience the hotel's restaurants, gyms and other facilities and equipment. I'll definitely try them out more next time I have the chance! I walked around the hotel lobby in the evening. The lobby is connected on all sides. When I walk around, I can see the scenery in all directions of Shenyang. The lobby is carefully designed on the 88th floor so that all guests can enjoy the good scenery. Check-out was very easy, without too much delay. All in all, it was a stay experience that exceeded expectations. I will choose Conrad Shenyang next time.

The facilities inside the hotel are very new. It has been many years since the hotel opened, but all the facilities are in good condition. It can be seen that they are carefully maintained. The hotel lobby is on the 88th floor, and you can see the entire city's landscape, including the sunset. Very, very good, the only thing is that the glass has not been wiped yet.
The room had not been cleaned when I checked in at the front desk. Wiley's service at the front desk was very good, warm and thoughtful. He arranged for me to go to the lobby bar to rest, and notified me as soon as the room was ready. After check-in, I was given fruit. During the period until check-out, I asked many times about my room experience. They were very considerate. They also took the initiative to introduce the hotel, Shenyang's historical attractions and surrounding food when I checked in. Thank you very much! Checking out was also very convenient. When they saw me queuing up, the staff took the initiative to ask. If I wanted to check out, I didn't have to queue up. I could just leave directly. It was very user-friendly.
In addition, the hotel's swimming pool environment is also very good, very clean, the water temperature is suitable, and the breakfast is also very delicious, with local specialties.
Wiley also gave us a small hotel tiger stuffed animal when we checked in, which was very cute. Next time I come to Shenyang, I will choose Shenkang!

Facilities: One thing that is particularly considerate is that there is a hot water pipe in the bathroom. The clothes you wash can be dried immediately the next day. Like it.
The breakfast buffet in the morning is also delicious. There are both Chinese and Western styles, especially the beef noodles. The ones made first are delicious. I must eat a lot of omelettes at the hotel's buffet breakfast. The omelettes must be paired with Thai sweet and spicy sauce.
Service: The service is really good. She is very attentive and considerate. Especially the restaurant manager in the morning. When he saw me taking care of my children, he thoughtfully prepared a small gift and a small balloon for my daughter. I really felt my heart. The thoughtful little thoughts in the morning will really start a good mood for the day.
In the evening, you can also go behind the reception desk and have a drink to get a little tipsy. If you don’t want to, you can take photos as well.

❤️The location is very good, 1 minute to the subway station, 10 minutes to the high-speed rail station, 30 minutes to the airport, and the hotel is still in the center. It only takes 10-20 minutes to take a taxi to Laobei City, West Tower, Shenyang Forbidden City and other attractions, which is very excellent. Right~
❤️Conrad Hotel, as Hilton's high-end luxury brand, goes without saying about its service. The front office, catering depar**ent, and housekeeping depar**ent are all very enthusiastic, provide good service, and take the initiative to help.
❤️If you bring your children, we will proactively prepare children's supplies, welcome cards, children's room cards, and Conrad Shenyang's mascot, the Siberian tiger Xiaokangkang. Your children will love it very much~

msg:A hotel that I am particularly satisfied with. To be honest, I have stayed in many high-end hotels in China, but it is rare to have such extremely considerate service as Conrad Shenyang, especially when people feel a kind of care from the heart instead of Because of the passive action at work. Helen, mia.Elena, Sylvia when checking in, Cathy Judy in the executive corridor, Lisa, Amanda, Tracy, Harvey in the cafeteria...there are so many dedicated employees. It is your professionalism that makes this hotel not only a hardware but also a hotel. The ceiling is also No.1 in software

First of all, the location of the hotel is really convenient, right in the city center, and the layout of the public areas is also very elegant. It has an artistic a**osphere. You need to take the elevator to go to the room. The room facilities are well maintained and the sanitation has been greatly improved. As for the service, the staff are all enthusiastic and the front desk and concierge are very good. Special thanks to Steven for the warm reception. Stay Very comfortable.

msg:There are very few reviews anymore. I have been to Shenyang for several business trips and I like this city very much, so let me talk about my experience this time.
First of all, location: 1-1 Qingnian Street, Metro Line 2, Plaza 66, Liaoning Grand Theater. Others are relatively sluggish, a bit standing out from the crowd. However, I don’t know much about the regional branches in Shenyang, so I won’t comment much.
Secondly, service: Good service for management and above positions, good communication efficiency, ability to handle problems, and solutions to problems. I would like to express my gratitude to Peter Jiang in particular. He also gave positive solutions to problems that occurred due to non-hotel reasons. Strong communication skills and speaking skills. Very comfortable so far. Thanks again
                  However, the service awareness of ordinary employees is lacking, especially the service center problem feedback (guests) do not communicate in a timely manner and have poor listening skills, which means rushing ducks to the shelves. Another is that the cleaning staff in public areas unconsciously compete with guests to use the elevator (different directions) ) This is very bad because due to the special nature of the hotel floors, you need to go to the 88th floor first and then change the elevator to the guest room. It will take a lot of time and will make you impatient (maybe I am pushing too much🤪)
Last meal: This time I only experienced the buffet breakfast in the Wenguan and the full buffet dim sum lunch
Let’s talk about breakfast first. There’s nothing to say about pastries. The bread is freshly baked and there are plenty of cold cuts. My favorite is bacon (I like the big ones🔥👍), but the Chinese food is not that good. The quality of multi-grain steamed pastries is average. There are few seasonal vegetables. The variety of porridge is not rich enough.
Besides, the dim sum buffet for lunch is highly recommended. It’s been a long time since I’ve had money belly and such soft and glutinous chicken feet. The husband and wife lung slices in the cold dish are also good. The shrimp dumplings are made and eaten freshly, but I packed a few a la carte chickens. The taste of the stewed mushrooms can be improved, and the quality of the chicken needs to be improved (the quality of the chicken is very good). The vinegar-coated caviar and pork knuckles are too greasy. It is recommended to pair them with a refreshing dipping sauce (Laba garlic is good). The stir-fried broccoli is delicious. The last thing I want to complain about is the rice cooking. It's so rotten and the rice flavor is gone (it's not as good as the fast food downstairs😱)
To sum up (only represents my personal opinion), the overall evaluation is 95 points, the service is 90 points (management), the catering is 90 points, the location is 95 points, and the hotel facilities are 95 points.
Very suitable for business trips
Message: "Service depends on details." The hotel relies on the development of the city and at the same time the hotel can also protect the development of the city (after all, it is number one🤩) It has been a long time since I wrote a hotel review. Everyone can take a look. It is best to go to the store to experience it and find Peter. Jiang

msg:First of all, the reason why I have to give a negative review is that the management team of this hotel has a problem with the national stance.
The buffet dinner we booked clearly told us that the eight-person table would rather be empty, and eight people must be full to dine. The five of us could only squeeze into a small table. As a result, the next morning, there was a foreigner sitting inside having a meal. This is the hotel's disrespect for the Chinese and its trea**ent of foreigners. I wonder if the country's current development is not enough to make you confident, or is it just a flattering look?
Second, the response the duty manager gave me was that you are overthinking and extremely unprofessional. Is this the standard of a hotel known as Shenyang’s top brand?
Third, the staff in the above-ground parking lot could not explain clearly the parking arrangements. They could only say that the hotel regulations require a report?
I hope that relevant hotel personnel will not call me to communicate. I will not delete the comments. If the team has self-awareness, please reflect on yourself, love your country, respect your own people, and improve your service awareness.
Also, let me tell you that all negative reviews are worth considering.

msg:It should be considered a pretty good hotel in Shenyang, but it actually didn't disappoint me. Everything was okay. Although I gave it a five-star rating, I still have to make some small suggestions. First, the hygiene of some parts of the room still needs attention, such as the dust on the socket board and the back of the bed. It is not right for the toilet trash can to be missed in the room. On the first day, the trash can in the washroom was shared. On the second day when the buckets were in place, I realized that the trash can in the washroom was for the toilet. The trash can in the washroom was missing. There was a trash can in the room. The cleaning staff put the toilet trash can in the washroom. I felt uncomfortable instantly. The second is the receptionist on the first floor. When we arrived, the revolving door after coming out of the subway couldn't move. We reported it to him and he said it wasn't broken without even looking at it. As a result, we tried it again after checking in and it still didn't work. Thinking that either we don't know how to use this door, or there is some secret to its use that we don't know, this became a mystery until we left Shenyang.

The restaurant services are very good, the rooms are very clean, and there is a need for service.
That's enough. Mia Monica sylvia at the front desk and Elena the duty manager provided attentive and detailed service and made me feel warm. It was a very comfortable stay~~

The hotel's location is very close to Shenyang's scenic spots and historic sites. The scenery is beautiful. The photos are very photogenic. The concierge Jacky Zhang, Ada Xu, Song Zhou, and Lili Tian warmly received the hotel. The warm service is very considerate. I will come again next time.

msg:There were indeed too many people during the holidays, so I went there late, and the front desk said there was no choice, only one room. Because I have children, I choose a double room every time. A double bed is too crowded. However, I booked the same room type. When I checked in, I found that it was not as big as last time. The layout was more depressing and the area was much smaller. However, during the holidays, I also expressed my understanding and just thought of making do with it. However, after I checked in, I found that the smell of smoke was getting louder and louder. It was really unbearable for people with respiratory sensitivities. It was so spicy that my eyes and throat hurt. But after communicating with the front desk, there was really no room available. After communicating with the manager on duty, the front desk changed the suite to a suite. Since there was only one bed, an extra bed was added. There was no cigarette smell after the change. But I missed my sleep time. As a poor sleeper like me, I did not get a good rest, but my family got a good rest. However, during the whole process, the staff worked actively to solve the problem and had a good attitude. They also solved the problem as soon as possible. They also sent fruits and toys. The manager on duty came over to help with things and deal with the problem, and apologized at the door. It is true that there are many people on holidays, and we understand that, so the overall service is still given 5 points. As for the problem of smoke smell, I think the management staff will also find the reason later. It may be the smell of flue strings. This smell has always been there. Coming out of the bathroom, I hope every room can have a good environment, otherwise some people will be dissatisfied when the room is full. The breakfast service was also very good. I kept asking about my dining experience and even brought fruits and snacks for the children to take with them when they went out to play. When I travel personally, I am more cautious in choosing hotels because I have poor sleep and poor rest, which really affects my travel. However, in addition to hardware, service is also very important, so I chose Conrad when I went to Shenyang these two times. Although they have flaws, they Their service and management made me feel very comfortable and warm, so that the guests would not feel aggrieved. As long as you feel uncomfortable, if you raise it, they will definitely solve it as soon as possible. This is very important. Communication is very important between people. When we travel, we will always encounter problems of one kind or another during the journey. It may not always go smoothly, especially during holidays when there are too many people, but how to solve the problems may be more important. In short, the whole process was enjoyable, so I will still give it five points. Next time I come to Shenyang, I will most likely choose Conrad. Praise the service staff in the business card for their good attitude. Although it scores five points, I still hope to correct my shortcomings and try to be as perfect as possible.

Except for takeaway food, you could ask the front desk to ask the concierge to deliver it to the room. The only drawback was that the elevator on the 88th floor would cause tinnitus, which made people feel uncomfortable. If you ordered food takeaway, you had to go through two elevators to get it.

First of all, I would like to thank Helen Zhang and Sylvia for their attentive reception. When checking in, the luggage was delivered directly to the room. It was very friendly for people with children. They also helped put the luggage in the car when leaving. The service was really great.
This time I booked a romantic room for Valentine's Day, and I was lucky enough to spend a wonderful day here (although it was romantic with a baby). Needless to say, the overall facilities are all located on high floors, overlooking the entire Shenyang, and the children's paradise. It is sunny, the gym and swimming pool are strictly managed, and the service is excellent.
Executive floor benefits for two people: The quality of the afternoon tea is great, and the happy hour also makes our family of three very happy.
Evening cocktails for two in the 88th-floor Shangguan: The taste is great, and it’s great for taking photos and checking in! Miss Shang Guan also gave instructions on how to take photos, which was very touching.
Romantic welcome gift: As shown in the picture, hahahaha, it’s really just like in the picture, there are roses on Valentine’s Day, heart-warming and happy. The deep-soaking bathtub is huge, and the rooms at Conrad are very high-ceiling and extremely comfortable.
The last souvenir is the Siberian tiger. My daughter is planning to take her to the Northeast with her. Next time we come, we will stay at Conrad~

The room is clean and tidy, and the bedding is very comfortable. I sleep well and get up early to experience the fitness center on the 86th floor. The fitness equipment is all imported and the environment is comfortable. It is the highest fitness center in Shenyang. The manager of the fitness center has good service. The swimming pool is not particularly big, but the water quality is clean and the overall quality is very good. After a workout, I went to the breakfast restaurant on the 88th floor. There were not many seats in the restaurant, but the environment was very comfortable. Maybe it was because of the business casual style. Wearing hotel slippers was not allowed in. The food bar was actually quite rich, but the design of the dining table was quite different. It's scattered and gives the impression that there are few types, but overall it's not bad. Check-out is also very fast, just give the room card to the front desk, no need to wait. For those who drive, park in the green area on the second floor. There is an elevator that goes directly to the 88th floor. Remember to report your license plate to the front desk every time you get out of the car. It's free. The girl at the front desk and the concierge guy are very proactive. Special thanks to Steven for the warm reception. It is a great hotel.

Service: It is worthy of being the number one hotel in Shenyang. The overall service is very considerate. Especially Clara at the front desk recommended a lot of check-in and food for us. She is very patient and feels at home. It is a perfect stay.

There were some minor incidents in the room. The room hygiene really needs to be improved. Fortunately, when I checked out, I met the manager on duty, Xiao Dong, who sincerely listened to my suggestions and added me to my contact information. It was considered "no acquaintance without contact". .
The software and services of the hotel are really good. The location is also good. It is worthy of being the best five-star hotel in Shenyang.
Thanks to the housekeeping lady and Xiao Dong for their service!

msg:I am very happy to choose to stay at Conrad Shenyang on my wedding anniversary.
I am a hotel enthusiast and like to explore luxury hotels. I struggled for a long time before coming to Shenyang, Northeast China, and finally chose Conrad Shenyang.
Location: The hotel is in a very good location. It is only one stop away from the high-speed rail station and the subway. Downstairs is Qingnian Street, the main road in Shenyang. You can reach the airport all the way south.
Service: The hotel's service is very considerate, especially the duty manager Xiao Dong. The service is very meticulous and makes people feel at ease. The mastery of the service is very good, which represents Conrad's service standards. He thoughtfully arranged the room for me and recommended me around Shenyang. The delicacies are all very reliable and considerate suggestions (Charcoal Grilled Chicken Head King) is really delicious and you can try it.
Hygiene: The only drawback is that the hygiene needs to be improved. There is a little dust on the window sill of the room, but it does not affect my stay experience.
I am very happy to have chosen Conrad Shenyang on such an important day. I will recommend this place to my friends. I praise Xiao Dong again!

msg:In a blink of an eye, the new year begins. The past year has been uneventful.
Peace and security are the results we expect. I just have some free time these days and have avoided the New Year's Day holiday travel peak. I discussed with my wife to treat our old couple and drive to Shenyang to visit Liaoning Expo, visit the North Market... and she readily agreed. We immediately booked a double bed room for 1.4 nights on Ctrip.com.
Xiao Gao at the hotel front desk warmly received us. Because I am a member, he upgraded our room for free and gave us two breakfast coupons for the next day.
The hotel's facilities, sanitary conditions, environment and services are all first-class. Quiet, comfortable and warm.
In the afternoon when we checked in, Xiao Gao helped us book a Wellington steak set meal for two at Lian Restaurant. After tasting it, the heat and flavor of the steak and the side dishes were all good.
In the afternoon we experienced the 86th floor swimming pool and it felt very good.
Finally, the elevator is fast and smooth. But my ears reacted slightly, but my lover basically had no reaction.

Especially suitable for families with two children! Because his twin room is 1.5 meters tall! ! This is so comfortable! And the system in the room is not hot at all! The mattress and pillows are perfect for me! Have a good sleep every day! Because it was so good to stay, I chose to stay here when returning to Shenyang from Harbin. The beef noodles for breakfast are really delicious! Bed bumpers and a set of daily necessities for children are also provided.

And the view outside the window is also very cool. As soon as we get to the 88th floor and the elevator opens, the wind blows really confusingly. In addition, the afternoon tea and evening light meals in the executive lounge are average. Can be strengthened.

The cocktail bar in the lobby is great. It was great to have a few drinks there in the evening. Don’t delay taking care of your baby either. Downstairs is Hang Lung! Shopping at Chanel is so convenient! Let’s talk about it again. The service in Chanel is also good, and there is no need to queue up.

I feel that Conrad is my first choice for staying at ➡️ and considerate service accounts for a large proportion. Manager Liu was also very considerate in helping us arrange this time. Thank you very much to him! In the past few days, we basically stayed in the hotel for food, accommodation and entertainment. Breakfast was on the 88th floor. The food was good and the service was very good. We saw balloons and snacks specially prepared for us with our two children. The water temperature of the swimming pool is very good and it should be considered the best in Shenyang. It was warm, and we arranged 2 swimming lessons for the children. The instructor was very professional and they had a lot of fun. The room service responded in a timely manner, and welcome cards and fruits were prepared when checking in. Highly recommended to stay👌

msg:The first time I stayed at the Conrad Shenyang Hotel, I really experienced what the ceiling felt like.
First of all, the transportation is convenient: the location is easy to find. Downstairs is Henglong Plaza, which is very convenient for eating and shopping. Nearby is Laobei City, which is brightly lit at night. It only takes about 10 minutes to go to Shenyang Forbidden City, Zhongjie, Xiaonan Church and other attractions. Downstairs is the subway station.
Room facilities: The space is really large, the items are well designed and arranged, the bedding is very comfortable, and there is a heated towel rack. It is not too happy for the winter in the Northeast. The room is on a high floor and has a good view. You can enjoy the sky at night. The night view is stunning, and the toiletries are all available. The bathroom with separate dry and wet areas and the round bathtub by the window are great for taking photos. I like all the design styles.
Finally, let me talk about the service, which is what makes me feel most at home: I came to the hotel for my birthday this time, so I have to mention Elena, the manager on duty, who was really patient and professional and communicated well. She called in advance to ask about my special needs. Zhizhi helped me prepare a lot in advance for my birthday, and the room was decorated in advance. When I entered the hotel on the day of check-in, there were concierge colleagues who helped me with my luggage. During my stay, the staff greeted me politely. Mia, the front desk clerk who helped me check in, was warm and thoughtful. She wished me a happy birthday as soon as she saw my birthday, which made me feel even better. A warm, cute little girl. Shortly after arriving at the room, the manager Elena and several other staff members who had called me actually pushed a birthday cake to my door to wish me well. It was really a surprise, thank you! In short, I really felt responsive and top-notch service throughout the entire process. It’s really worth everyone to experience it. It’s a perfect trip. Thank you!

(Compared with the hotels I booked in Erbin later, Conrad is really just so good!!!!)
The hotel is in a very good location. It is in the Municipal Square and is very convenient to go to Beiling Park on West Tazhong Street. It is directly connected to Plaza 66 next door.
The hotel service facilities and other aspects are very good and can meet customer needs in a timely manner.
The buffet breakfast has a rich variety and there are quite a lot of people dining in the morning.
The hotel lobby is on the 88th floor, and you need to take another elevator to go to the guest room.
It happened to snow one day, and when I looked down from the hotel in the morning, I saw a vast expanse of white, which was very beautiful.
I will choose Conrad next time I come to Shenyang.

msg:Overall, I was very satisfied with my stay. Although there were some hiccups, the hotel handled them quickly and satisfactorily. When I checked in, the room was close to the emergency exit and there was a loud fan sound. After communicating with the front desk, I was upgraded to a deluxe twin suite with a discount. It was large in size, had a good view, and was very comfortable. At the same time, the experience in the executive lounge was particularly satisfactory. The service was attentive while maintaining a good sense of distance, making people feel at home. The service of cloris gong, sarah and ken made the experience of afternoon tea and happy hour outstanding. Of course, there are some small details that I hope to pay attention to⚠️. When we checked in, the young waiter at the concierge on the first floor did not help us with our luggage when he was free, or even said hello and showed us the way. When we entered the door, we didn't know whether to go left or right to check in. When we turned around after taking the wrong turn, another concierge inside saw us and came to guide us. This kind of lapse in detail is really annoying at first and I hope the hotel pays attention to it. Of course, the overall experience is very satisfying. From check-in to room facilities, views, and sanitation, everything is as good as it should be. I will choose Conrad next time I come to Shenyang.

The breakfast in the hotel and the meals in the executive lounge are also quite rich👍but the complimentary afternoon tea really needs to be improved in taste and is not as good as the afternoon tea in the executive lounge! The water pressure in the shower in the room is small, so taking a bath is not very comfortable. The supplies are BYREDO and the quality is not bad. The mineral water is not enough. The housekeeping will be replenished for free (this is a high-end hotel service) because not all five-star hotels in China provide it for free!
In addition, the hotel service staff ratio is enough so that you will not be unable to find anyone, no matter the restaurant or the front desk. This is still good in today's chaotic service industry😊So I will choose Conrad Hotel next time I go to Shenyang!

Facilities: The overall facilities have always been very online and well maintained. There should be no better choice at the same level in Shenyang.
Hygiene: The room can be said to be spotless and cleaned very well. After staying in the room for two nights, it was tidied up when I returned to the room. They also provided considerate turndown service. I am very grateful to the cleaning ladies for their efforts.
Environment: It can be said that Conrad has achieved excellent quality in all aspects. I like the facilities of the gym the most. It is really great to exercise in the sky. The swimming pool is also very enjoyable with the lighting and a**osphere at night. By the way, I also used the sauna.
Service: Finally, let me talk about the service. Special thanks to Peter and Jennie at the front desk for their excellent service. Because the day we checked in was the Chris**as holiday, there were many guests staying in the hotel. The two quality and efficient services provided smooth check-in and no impact at all, including refunds. The room was fast, efficient and smooth. I felt like I was at home. I would also like to thank Cathy. Celina. Jaelyn from the executive lounge for her excellent service. It was my first time to experience afternoon tea in the hotel’s executive lounge. It felt great. In the afternoon The tea cakes are very exquisite. I will come again next time, but I am not very satisfied with the western restaurant. I originally wanted to take my wife to have a steak, but there was only one waiter at the meal. After waiting for a long time, I was told that I could only make a reservation. Only a set meal, which feels very unfriendly to hotel guests.

Thank you to Monica, Elena, Mia and Helen for their warm service during your stay. The hotel called in advance to ask about the arrival time and whether there were any special needs; from the time of check-in, the front desk reminded every matter in detail; the turndown service was also in place; when I met the room attendant, I asked for a few more bottles of water to be delivered to the room, and she was immediately I was given 4 bottles of water, but later I discovered that there was actually a lot of water in the room, and I couldn’t finish it. I had to catch the high-speed train early the next morning, and after a simple breakfast, the restaurant waiter specifically reminded me to pack some pastries and fruits to avoid unnecessary trouble. Not full. So at 7 o'clock in the morning, when I left Conrad, I was holding a warm cup of coffee, a small bag of strawberry croissants and apples, and my heart was warm.
Talk about the room. The reserved 86-square-meter suite will be upgraded to a 107-square-meter classic suite for free. If you come to Shenyang in the future, you must get the classic suite room type:
1. Corner suite with unparalleled view; 2. There is a water bar and high table, where you can have a drink and relax; 3. Round bathtub and large panoramic window, you can take a bath while looking at the night view; 4. The space is very spacious, and there is no need for an extra bed Impact; 5. The whole house is smart, the lighting control is very reasonable, and the bedroom and living room can independently complement each other.
In general, the hotel is very new, well decorated and conveniently located (Henglong is downstairs, 10 minutes to Shenyang North Railway Station)

msg:The hotel service is quite good, and the breakfast is also very good, until 10:30. We were also upgraded to a suite. The view after the snow is particularly good. The swimming pool is open until 10 pm. The freshly squeezed juice on the executive floor is delicious. I didn't make it for afternoon tea because I was playing outside all the time. I would like to express my special thanks to the management staff of the swimming pool for helping me deliver my cell phone that I left there to the front desk of the gym. I would also like to thank Helen Zhang and Mia for giving the children toys before leaving.

msg:1. It’s a suite after all. The welcome fruit was not given and the turndown was not done.
2. When I returned to the hotel in the evening, I contacted the front desk to report some situations. They were told that fruit would be delivered and 2 bottles of water would be delivered. However, after more than ten minutes, what was delivered was cut fruit and it had obviously been left out for a long time and had a peculiar smell. In the end, The important thing is that even the water that was sent was not delivered.
3. The bath water is not hot and small (maybe the pressure on the high floor is not enough)
4. Don’t say hello to the waiters when you meet them in the hotel or elevator. Normal staff training in five-star hotels must be to say hello to guests when they see them.
5. Take a taxi to the door of the hotel. Two security guards stood chatting at the door, but they didn’t open the door. It doesn’t meet the standards of a five-star hotel.
6. The date of the mineral water is actually 22.7, which is already 16 months. Although it has not expired, it is a little old. Could it be that this room has never been occupied?
7. I called the front desk the next day to ask for a latex pillow, but it didn't come after waiting for 2 hours.
There is also a better part: in the afternoon of the next day, a hotel staff contacted me to apologize and also sent me fruit.

Personally, I find it inconvenient to have to transfer to the elevator to enter and exit the hotel. There are not many choices for breakfast in the hotel. There is also a little regret about this stay. When I looked at the night view outside the room I was assigned, I saw that it was a construction site🏗.

The hotel is located in the high-rise city center and is very convenient to go anywhere. It snowed that day, and the lady at the front desk gave us a seat with a better view. The round bathtub was so comfortable to bathe in. The bath here is very large. As expected, Shenyang is the place to go for bathing in China.
Thx PA elder sisters Candice Liu and Hong Ma, it is too dry in the north, we called the front desk to send water, they were very efficient, they have been replenishing water for us for the past two days, and we deeply felt the hotel's sincere service.
The Chinese restaurant on the fourth floor is very cheap. Because it was too cold, we asked for In-Room Dining, and the waiter at the restaurant immediately agreed to arrange a meal. Thank you very much.

You can park your car on the second floor of the shopping mall. There is an elevator that goes directly to the front desk on the 88th floor. The entire 88th floor is very warm and luxurious. The scenery is very beautiful. It feels like you can see the mountains at a glance. , the facilities in the room are first-class, hygienic and clean, and the stay is very comfortable. The fitness center and swimming pool are on the 86th floor. The facilities are imported and the environment is great. The swimming pool should be the highest in Shenyang. The water quality is very good. It is worthy of being the top brand in Shenyang. The service of the hotel and staff is very good. Check-in was handled by Mr. STEVEN, who was very professional. The girls at the front desk greeted each other with smiles. It was hard for the concierge guys to stand on the first floor in the cold weather. They were all proactive in helping. Guests, all excellent staff, very good hotel.

msg:I came to Shenyang for business and stayed at the legendary Conrad for the first time. It can be said that I was full of expectations, but I have to say that this experience was not good. Although the beauty at the concierge desperately wanted to give a positive review when leaving the hotel, she really didn't want to go against her wishes. Briefly speaking of the shortcomings: 1. For my first stay, I booked a deluxe double room, but the layout of the room I stayed in did not match the promotional photos (Pictures 1 and 2). The space was cramped and the layout was unreasonable, giving people a depressing feeling. . Since I was only staying for one night, I didn't ask to change rooms. However, is it not appropriate to arrange such a room for the first time a guest checks in? 2. The hair dryer in the hotel. It can no longer be described as poor. The air volume is still very small when turned on to the maximum. It took 15 minutes after I asked for a replacement. The hair dryer was dirty and broken (see the photo). I asked if there was a better hair dryer, and the lady said that the hotel was working on it. I have been changing layer by layer but I haven’t reached your layer (the swimming pool locker rooms are all Dyson). I am really speechless😓. Can I understand that I am not worthy? ! 3. The water output from the shower head is too small, making bathing uncomfortable! Advantages: 1. The breakfast is pretty good; 2. The decoration facilities are very new.

I went to the gym specifically this time, and the environment, scenery, and service staff are both amazing. We also gave small gifts upon check-in and departure, which was very thoughtful. It is a service that is completely consistent with the price.
Environment: I stayed in a room on the 83rd floor this time, and I was lucky. The weather was great these two days. The view from the top floor overlooks the entire Shenyang, especially at night. The scenery is really great.
Double executive floor benefits: Not to mention the scenery and environment, they are really great. It is worth mentioning that the food is very different from the first time I came here. It can be seen that the operator has put some thought into it. Cloris from the executive restaurant also took good care of us and her service attitude was very good.

Compared with hotels of this level, the breakfast and lounge food varieties are still simple and not rich enough. The swimming pool is good, with a good view of 86 meters, and the water is clean, but the dry steam temperature is not up to 40 degrees, which needs to be improved. The room may have less fresh air due to the winter temperature. Although the room no longer smells like decoration, after a day, you can clearly feel the smell after entering the door. The service staff are warm and considerate, especially Kevin Zhang at the swimming pool on the 86th floor who is very responsible and responsible in reminding time for help. Thumbs up. The front desk staff on the 83rd and 88th floors are friendly and have a commanding view. The service of the waiters in the restaurant on the 88th floor needs further training and improvement. The chef Henry was given a five-minute explanation on the spot. I believe he will benefit from it for life. I accidentally tasted Ms. Yang and was a bit surprised. I may come back next time. 😁

The front desk, restaurant, and public areas are designed differently to create a "one scene at a time" effect. Coupled with the advantages of Shenyang's tallest landmark building outside the window, it makes people's eyesight. Bright~

The gym and swimming pool on the 86th floor have a good view and can be used more rationally than similar high-floor hotels. The area is larger and there are many new types of equipment.

Floors 80-83 are executive floors, and the rooms are comfortable. The double room has a round bathtub. You can also see the outdoor scenery while taking a bath, which is one of the highlights. Although the executive floor benefits in the afternoon and evening are not many, they are good. The breakfast is more exquisite, and the capsule coffee and freshly squeezed juice are delicious. The breakfast style is rich, but I personally feel that there is room for improvement in taste.

Although there was some dissatisfaction when booking the room, it was resolved in time. The staff are warm and courteous. Special thanks to the 6 service staff in the executive lounge and the front desk staff. To be fair, compared to other cities, the warm and courteous staff cannot conceal the internal management system, management level, catering level of Conrad Shenyang Hotel, etc. There are many flaws. I hope there will be greater improvements and improvements when I visit again!

When checking in, the front desk thoughtfully presented the hotel's unique mascot "Kangkang" the Siberian tiger, which is very characteristic of Shenyang.
The hotel is located in the city center of Shenyang, No. 1 Qingnian Street, Shenhe District. Downstairs is the City Hall 66 shopping mall. It is very close to the high-speed rail station, the Forbidden City and the Marshal's Mansion.
The duty managers at the front desk, Xiao Dong and Mr. Steven, checked me in very quickly and efficiently. Moreover, it was the heating season in Shenyang, so the room would be a bit dry. Xiao Dong promptly arranged a humidifier for my room. I was very considerate and satisfied.
All in all, it was a very satisfying travel experience and I highly recommend Conrad Shenyang! !

When we returned to the hotel, we felt very uncomfortable due to gastroenteritis, so we asked Willey at the front desk to help us check in as soon as possible. Very efficient. The room was ready at 10:30. Thank you very much!

However, there were still problems with the guest rooms. There were problems with the water cups, bathtubs, curtains and hair dryers. I called the front desk to tell them and the front desk sent a dessert tray. Then I was upgraded to a suite and given a breakfast card.

The hotel itself still has many problems, but the service attitude at the front desk is very good and they will work hard to optimize the guest experience. Thank you Willey and Peter.

I like the hotel design very much. Dazheng Palace has many elements.
I am very grateful to the hotel duty manager Xiao Dong for his careful arrangements. There have been some incidents at Conrad Shenyang before, but I am very satisfied with the handling of the duty manager Xiao Dong.
It is recommended to get a room facing east so you can see the sunrise and the Forbidden City when the weather is good.
Next time I come to Shenyang, I will continue to choose Conrad Hotel. The hotel’s auspicious doll is the Eight Banners Tiger, which is very characteristic of Northeast China. I highly recommend Conrad Shenyang.

I wanted to go to the Cantonese restaurant on the 4th floor for tea at noon, but the Forbidden City was too crowded and I couldn't make it in time. I had to go there next time I come to Shenyang. It is about a 10-minute drive from the Forbidden City, Xiaonan Church and other attractions (when there is no traffic).
The best thing is that the staff in the lobby are very professional and thoughtful. Amy is so attentive🌹🌹🌹👍👍👍

For breakfast, we still recommend adding some freshly squeezed juice according to the season. Thumbs up to our egg stall guy~the eggs benedict are delicious! The heat and oil temperature are just right! 😍Other meals are also quite satisfactory, in line with our expectations for the Conrad brand.

A hotel that impressed us the most.
From the first moment I checked in, I received a birthday greeting from Manager Liu Chuang, which was really heartwarming and surprising. The staff on the executive floor were polite and responsible, and prepared handwritten blessing notes and fruit plates. They also prepared children's toiletry bags and Kangkang, the little lion doll representing the Conard Hotel, for the baby. The child loved it! The room decoration is also very thoughtful, with balloons and light signs, giving it a full a**osphere. We deliberately chose the east-facing room because the child wanted to "beautify the sun". Although the child did not get up in the end, my husband and I were surprised and took beautiful shadow photos. We were so happy🥳Although the price of the executive floor is slightly higher, it includes afternoon tea and For dinner and breakfast, you really don’t have to worry about eating. You can just relax in the hotel and take care of the baby without thinking. The swimming pool on the 86th floor is also highly recommended. If you don’t like swimming, you can spend time in the small warm swimming pool. Although the children's activity room is not big, it has books, a climbing frame, and urban building blocks that can be inserted on the wall. The children together played with it for a long time.
Overall, this year’s happy birthday is given by my husband and Conrad Hotel🥰Thanks again to Manager Liu Chuang and the room team for their thoughtful arrangements and meticulous service. I can’t wait to join the hotel membership and look forward to visiting again soon🎉🎉🎉

It is not far from famous attractions such as the Shenyang Forbidden City, Zhongjie, Laobei City, and West Tower. It can be reached by walking or riding a bicycle; Below the hotel is Plaza 66, which is very convenient for eating and shopping.
Environmental facilities: The hotel is located on the 66th to 88th floors of Plaza 66. It overlooks Shenyang City and has a good view. The elevator goes directly to the 88th floor in 60 seconds to check in at the hotel front desk. There is a 24-hour free gym and indoor swimming pool (6-22 o'clock). Although there is no time to exercise. I also took a look and found that the equipment is quite complete. There are also other facilities such as children's playground, coffee shop, executive lounge and so on.
Service: What I want to mention the most is the hotel's service. I booked a deluxe king bed suite at that time. The hotel upgraded me to a classic suite for free, gave me welcome fruit, San Pellegrino sparkling water and Evian mineral water, and provided late check-out. At 4 o'clock in the afternoon, on the day of check-out, the hotel's restaurant waiter also presented desserts, ice cream, fruits, drinks and the hotel's mascot, the tiger.
Special thanks to: Liu Chang, Xiaoxue and Kang Panpan, the little sisters, not only look cute, but also have great service. I hope to enjoy their service next time I stay.

The result of my stay was super satisfactory. Needless to say, the room facilities are very new. Mainly, I am very satisfied with the hotel's service. Every afternoon I take my children to the executive lounge to eat and chat. Manager Gong made a little tiger key card for my children, which is very cute. The hotel's breakfast is also good, with a rich variety, especially the food is replenished very promptly, so you don't have to worry about arriving late and not being able to eat. On the morning before we left, Lisa prepared a large bag of fruit and drinks for us, and made small balloon toys for the children. I was very moved. Also thank you to Manager Guo and Harvey. When leaving the hotel, Ada Xu, the concierge on the first floor, greeted her with a smile. Song asked about the check-in experience and helped call a taxi.

I personally felt the presence of the "Shenyang Skyline". High-rise buildings can be seen from far away, which makes people feel particularly safe. It is recommended to look at the high-rise buildings behind the red walls and yellow tiles from the direction of the Forbidden City, and you can travel back 400 years at a glance.
The hotel lobby is located on the 88th floor of the top floor. The high-speed elevator can be reached directly in 1 minute. When you get out of the elevator, you can see the scenery outside the floor-to-ceiling windows of the spacious lobby. Moreover, if you go around from the lobby to the coffee bar and then to the restaurant, you can have a panoramic view of Shenyang. It is really great. beautiful!
The room facilities are convenient. Each bed in the twin room is 1.5 meters wide, which is very suitable for family travel. The breakfast is a combination of Chinese and Western. Although it is not particularly rich, it can satisfy all your cravings.
In short, Conrad’s quality assurance is absolutely no problem. If the price is acceptable, it will definitely be a choice you won’t regret👍

msg:Thanks to Zhou Song for helping with this trip. As a member of the concierge, not only is the attitude sincere, but also the help is appropriate. In addition, two Shengjing tiger cubs were prepared for us who were about to leave the store. Thank you very much.

Hotel lovers usually stay in hotels when traveling. The place they go to the most is Hainan. It can be said that I have almost stayed in all the hotels in Hainan. The hotel booking this time was completely unexpected. I chose Conrad Shenyang on a whim. I didn’t bring a mobile phone charging cable or a change of clothes. My friend and I both borrowed charging cables from the front desk, thank you very much.

The Conrad in Shenyang is positioned more towards the business travel category, rather than the tourism and vacation category. It has all the standard features of the same star rating, but the decoration is more satisfactory and the services are in place.


Breakfast: My Chinese stomach really likes boiled vegetables and chicken soup.

Facilities: The bed is very high and soft, and the pillows are both very soft. My waist is not good and I prefer a softer bed, so the sleeping experience is not good.

If I go to Shenyang next time, I will still stay there. After all, this should be considered the ceiling of Shenyang’s hotel (? maybe?)

As soon as we arrived at the hotel, there was a concierge guy who helped us with our luggage. They were all very energetic. Check-in was on the 88th floor and the front desk was small. The girls are very warm and considerate. The rooms are arranged together, which is very convenient. You need to take the elevator to go back to the room. The room is big enough and has luxurious facilities. You can see half of Shenyang city from the room. The whole hotel feels very comfortable. , light luxury. The service is very online.

msg:Lightning, really sucks, sorry for the price.
The brand premium is 1400 yuan, the facilities are only worth 600 yuan, and the service may not be as good as 200 yuan.
It is said that the Harbin Ritz is the worst Ritz in the country, and you are not as good as his in all aspects. I think you are the worst in the country among hotels in this category.
The management is probably thinking about how to be stingy and how to save money, so that customers will feel that it is bad and they will not have to change hotels after check-in, because it is very troublesome to carry luggage.
Checked in around 10:11 in the evening. There was only one security guard outside the door on the entire first floor, and there was no one inside the door. The concierge desk was empty. After searching for a few laps, other guests who have already stayed in the hotel gave directions to find the elevator. I asked the front desk why there was no one downstairs and told me to have a meeting. But I stayed for 4 days, and I only saw people on the night of the concert, and no one at other nights. Do you have meetings every day?
The elevator is also well hidden. When you enter the door, turn right to the end, turn left to the end, and then turn left to the end. There is no sign in the whole process. Stayed for 4 days and pointed the way to countless people.
There was only one person at the front desk, and it took a long time for another person to come, and the check-in was very slow.
The place where the elevator card is swiped is the small place where the card is written, so why do you leave a black piece underneath? On the day of check-in, I couldn’t get it out no matter how I swiped it, and the stranger in the elevator laughed at me for not swiping the card. People from Shenyang The quality is really poor. After staying for a few days, I also instructed countless people how to swipe the elevator card.
Going to the room has to change the elevator twice, it will not appear more noble, it will only be more troublesome. I always thought that only B & B hotels in high-rise buildings need to change elevators. For example, the high-rise United Building in Chongqing does this. The Westin lobby is also on the top, but the first floor can also go directly to the room floor.
The size of the room looks very small, and there is no indication of 50 or 60 square meters at all. Is it possible that if I live in a hotel, it will be considered a shared share?
The corner room in the remarks, but it is much worse than the buyer's show, it is completely cheating. The table is almost waist-high, and it is not a floor-to-ceiling window at all. There is also a pillar to block the corner. After knocking it, it is empty, which completely destroys the corner.
The bed was very small.
For the first time, I saw my aunt not stuffing the quilt under the mattress after making the bed, but directly folding it to cover the bed.
The pillow is too low, even the neck pillow is low, and I have a stiff neck.
There is only one trash can in the bathroom. It is the first time I have seen that there is no trash can in a separate toilet compar**ent. Is it because women don’t deserve to live in your hotel, or are you happy when I throw the towel into the toilet for my aunt?
The toilet lid made two beeps, which was also annoying, because I put the trash can into the toilet room, and the toilet had to be opened to throw out the trash, and then suddenly closed with two beeps after a long time, which was very noisy.
The spare parts are all big bottles. I hate this kind of hotel that uses the health of guests to save money. Environmental protection is just an excuse.
The ceiling of the cloakroom leaked, but fortunately it was only on the floor.
The hygiene is not good, the aunt is too lazy. When I stay in a hotel, I must ask for the bathtub to be disinfected. I’ve seen high-quality ones that have been rubbed clean inside and out for a long time, I’ve seen perfunctory ones that are finished with just a couple of squirts of disinfectant, and I’ve seen ones that are rotten and can’t be bothered to get a bathtub bag. The last type is common in Huazhu Group’s non-three, four, and five-star hotels. Your foreign brands do as the Romans do, and you don’t learn from the good ones to learn from the bad ones. You can also bring a bathtub bag.
The Internet celebrity swimming pool is a thing that looks like a swank but doesn't work. Lifeguards are often not on their seats. You can’t take it lightly just because the water is 1.4 meters shallow. If you get cramps or pass out, you can still drown. Is this something you can be lazy about?
I went swimming twice, entered the women's changing room 4 times, and only once saw the auntie and she was not cleaning after less than 5 minutes. So there are dirty towels all over the floor, and some sections of the road have accumulated water, which can be splashed when walking.
There are only five or six showers in the changing room, and I went to two of which were full of minor problems with the nozzles.
It is also the first time I have encountered that there will be no water in the locker room. Not to mention bottled water, you can't even drink straight water because there are no cups. I saw two dirty cups in the cabinet the day before, and those two were still untouched the next day.
One person can only use one bath towel in the locker room, which is placed in the cabinet. The big cabinet next to it obviously has a place for towels, but it just refuses to put them out for you, for fear that you will be poor if you wash one more bath towel.
On the first day, the bath towel had a sour smell of wood, and on the second day, it smelled of wood plus sweat and musty. Everyone in the south knows that during the rainy season, old clothes will have this smell if they are not dried in the sun. I didn't expect a hotel in the north to encounter it. Then there is no staff in the locker room, what should I do, I can only call the front desk and ask him to notify me.
If you can see this comment, if you have to live and swim, it is recommended to bring the bath towels in the room for use.
Bottled water in the gym costs money, and there is only direct drinking water.

The car can be parked in the garage on the third floor. There is an elevator up to the 88th floor. The front desk is on the 88th floor. The scenery is really beautiful, and there are many artwork decorations, which give people a very comfortable feeling. When we checked in, we met Mr. STEVEN, who was really gentleman and caring. He introduced many facilities and precautions of the hotel. We saw that we brought our children with us I also took the initiative to invite my baby to participate in the treasure hunting activity of Kangkang Tour in Shenyang. The baby is very happy. The hotel is also careful in this regard. The equipment and facilities in the room are first-class. The design of the electric towel rack is very considerate. Put some clothes on the second It was done in one day, and the room attendants Ma Hong and Wang Yao greeted and greeted Yingying with a smile.

msg:Pleasant check-in experience. The hotel is located on the upper floor of the City Hall Plaza 66. However, the shopping mall is not very accessible. It is not too far to go to other scenic spots or business districts. Generally, I choose to avoid rush hours by taking a taxi. I was a little disappointed when I first arrived at the hotel. There was no reception at all in the lobby on the first floor, so I had to tentatively find the elevator on the 88th floor. However, the service at the front desk on the 88th floor was very warm and thoughtful, and I presented the hotel's mascot, a little tiger . It was different from when we arrived. Leon and Amy, the concierges, had excellent service attitudes when we left the store.
Facilities: The hotel has good hardware, elegant decoration style, equipped with smart toilets, but the hair dryer is not very easy to use.
Executive Lounge: The view on the 83rd floor is excellent, the happy hour dishes are also rich, and the service is also very warm.
Service: The room service is fast and the response is very timely, which is much better than the high-rise hotels I have stayed in before. The details are also very good. On the first day, because I ordered a few extra bottles of mineral water, the aunt put a lot of bottles in the room when cleaning the next day, which was very heartwarming.
Breakfast: quite satisfactory, not many types, the beef noodles are delicious, but it is much better than the other Conrad I stayed in before.

msg:The overall experience of staying at Conrad Shenyang this time was not particularly good. Although I didn't set my expectations too high before I checked in, it was really not satisfactory in some aspects. It can be said that apart from the facilities, in other respects, the standards of four-star hotels in the South or abroad are not even met, let alone a luxury five-star hotel brand like Conrad.
When we arrived at the hotel, two or three concierges at the entrance of the hotel were playing with their mobile phones instead of entertaining customers. The importance of concierge is far greater than many people think. The concierge represents the first impression, if the concierge is not good then the guest will not be satisfied with the hotel in the first place.
As our check-in time was around 11:00 noon, the room was not available, told us to call before 3:00 to let us know. These are OK, but the front desk forgot to ask a very important point: whether you want a non-smoking room.
After notifying us that the room was cleaned at 2:30, we took our room card and went to room 6923. We smelled a strong smell of cigarettes, and felt that a guest had smoked at least one pack of cigarettes that morning. We went back to the front desk and asked to change rooms and

It is clear that life requires a non-smoking room, but the front desk actually told 6923 that it is a non-smoking room. A non-smoking room has such a strong smell of smoke, shouldn’t the room manager ask the reason for the cleaning? And shouldn’t the air freshener be used to remove the smell of smoke? What’s even more outrageous is that the second non-smoking room 7313 still smells of smoke. Two consecutive non-smoking rooms smell of smoke. As a person who smells cigarettes and wants to throw up, I can't accept it at all. At this time, the manager said that this hotel does not have any management and punishment measures for smoking in non-smoking rooms, and there is no no-smoking sign in the room. Why didn’t you remind us not to smoke? The manager explained that Northeast people love to smoke and can’t control it, but I have never seen Northeast people smoke on the plane or high-speed rail, so I don’t quite accept this explanation.
While waiting for the new room, I saw that many people who checked in were told that the room was still being cleaned and needed to wait. It was already 3:40 at that time. If you can’t get the room card when you check in after 3:00, you are not eligible. .
Fortunately, the handling method at the front desk is recognized after all: upgrade the room type + free double breakfast. It can show that the hotel still has a sense of service and has a positive attitude in dealing with problems, which is worthy of praise. So actually, I didn't want to write a bad review until I saw this suite room.
I have never seen a five-star hotel with such poor sanitation, which is worse than ordinary express hotels and homestays. There were dirty marks and hairs on the quilt cover, so I asked the cleaning depar**ent to come over and change it. As a result, the cleaning aunt didn't ring the door bell.

I came in by myself, and after changing a set, there were still holes. Crazy chipped walls, dirty tabletops, dusty floors, scratched hair dryers, dirty showers. If you tell me that this room has not been lived in or cleaned for a month, I will believe it. I just want to say that in terms of hygiene, one point is the lower limit of Ctrip, not your lower limit of Shenyang Conrad. If possible, I would like to give 0 points or even negative points.
Some aspects of the room facilities are also very bad. For example, the night lights on both sides must be turned on and off at the same time, the curtains on both sides must be turned on and off at the same time, and the doors on both sides must also be turned on and off at the same time. Does the person who designed the hotel learn geometry or have obsessive-compulsive disorder? Why do they like symmetry so much? There are also table sockets The computer plug cannot be plugged in, the hair dryer has a low wind speed and high temperature, which is not as good as Atour’s hair dryer, and the sofa collapses when you sit on it, etc.
The breakfast is not bad, but it is far from the level of Conrad, not even the Hilton in the south, nor the newly opened Marriott in North Station. And some waiters in the restaurant are also very unprofessional. After guiding the customers to sit for breakfast for two days, they didn't ask if they want coffee or tea. This is also very unprofessional.
When I write a bad review for a hotel, I don't want everyone to go to a certain hotel to avoid lightning, but I hope that this hotel can properly solve its own problems. As the most luxurious hotel in Shenyang and even in Northeast China, your hotel has attracted many foreign guests. Your hotel is now the business card of the city of Shenyang, and you should use your own actions to make a good impression on this city for tourists from other provinces and foreign countries. Therefore, I propose the following suggestions to the hotel:

1. Strengthen the training of the professional ability of employees in various depar**ents. It is obvious that the business capabilities of a certain depar**ent are flawed.
2. Reorganize the cleaning depar**ent. This level of hygiene is already very explosive in any Hampton and garden, let alone Conrad. And at 3:40pm there are many rooms that have not been cleaned, neither efficient nor quality. 3. Change those weird designs in the facility.
4. Set up clear and strict penalties for smoking in non-smoking rooms, place them in conspicuous places in each non-smoking room, and install smoke alarms.

The next day, I went to the front desk angrily and asked my aunt to change it. I also left a thank you note. As soon as I walked in, I found this person with blood in his urine and feces before going to bed. Unknown mark.
The hotel sent someone to apologize, changed the quilt, and asked if there was anything else that needed to be checked. I would like to ask, is the quality of your cleaning done by consumers?
The bathroom was full of water stains and I couldn't take pictures with my phone. The water would never go down. On the first day I checked in, there was still bath water left by the previous resident on the floor. I was really devastated.

msg:The hotel is relatively new, especially the front desk is set on the 88th floor, overlooking most of Shenyang City, and the view is very good when it is sunny. The front desk staff is very nice. When I checked in on Friday night, the foreman, Ms. Zhang, watched me take my baby out and upgraded us to a suite for free. Yesterday afternoon, the handsome Xiaoliang, the foreman on the first floor, was very caring in addition to his warm service. I got a small gift from the hotel; special thanks to these two hotel employees, who left me with a very good accommodation experience.

When we confirmed with the front desk, the staff was attentive and thoughtful, and upgraded the room type for us. The super beautiful view room overlooking the city panorama is beautiful. In such a tourist summer vacation, the experience of choosing a relatively high-end hotel is obviously better than that of an ordinary light luxury hotel, it is worth it! Praise the following staff for their careful care👍

msg:The hotel where I stayed well and stayed for another day is worthy of being a landmark hotel in Shenyang. The lobby is on the 88th floor, and Shenyang is dimly lit at night. The details and color matching of the designer hotel are low-key and luxurious. The rooms are spacious and bright, the bedding is clean and tidy, and the mattress is moderately soft and hard, so you can sleep well. There are a variety of Chinese and Western breakfasts, as well as local pies and snacks. On the edge of the subway, it is convenient to travel around. Special thanks to Manager Cui Dan who helped me during breakfast! Conrad Hotel is the first choice when you come to Shenyang again. The service team here has attitude and warmth!

Whether it was the service attitude of each service staff or the hotel environment, our family felt so good that we added another night to the room originally booked for two nights. Although my husband accidentally squeezed his hand, the waiter immediately brought the medicine box, and went to buy medicine the next day, and the manager went to the room to express his condolences. When he learned of my husband’s birthday, he even arranged a room surprise. There are also cakes and dolls for children. It’s so wow that Shenyang has left us a very good impression. I believe that because of this hotel, I will come to Shenyang again, and I will definitely come to Conrad Live, the viewing room is so spectacular and refreshing.

Facilities: Personally, I think it is relatively new in Conrad nationwide, and the design is also very novel. The towel rack in the bathroom self-heats quickly and is very user-friendly, which is convenient for drying things.
Hygiene: The corners are clean, there is no dust on the lamps, and the bedding is almost flawless in the room I live in.

When we checked in at night, we could overlook the night view of Shenyang. The person who checked us in was IVY ZHANG. He was not only beautiful, but also had a very good service attitude. As soon as we got off the plane, we felt the enthusiasm of the beautiful sister from Shenyang. , so the sense of experience is UP. When I learned that my friend and I were traveling, he also introduced us to the special places in Shenyang. The breakfast bakes are especially delicious.

I have actually experienced it, and I feel that the name is well-deserved. First of all, the lobby is on the top floor of the 88th floor. The building is also a landmark, so it is easy to find. The second is to meet every staff member in the hotel, no matter whether you have direct contact with you or not, they are polite, warm and generous. Here is a special mention to Clara Song, the guest service foreman, her team Elena and Sylvia, and Xiao Dong (? The name is not exact) from the reservation depar**ent, thank them for helping me upgrade the suite. The room area is very large, about 100 square meters, and the high-level view is very good, and you can have a bird's-eye view of the city. As for the conditions, there is really no need to go into details, in short, all aspects are very considerate. Enjoy drinking and dining in the executive lounge, and relax physically and mentally.

I came here because of this sense of design, and I like the design here.
Enjoying breakfast on the 88th floor is a great experience, with a variety of varieties, but the level of breakfast waiters needs to be improved.
Overall, it was a very satisfying stay experience, and I would recommend my friends to stay again when I come to Shenyang in the future😄

msg:Knowing that the Conrad brand has a store in Shenyang, and seeing that Ctrip has a good price, I booked this hotel. This is the first time I have returned to the Northeast after twenty years, and I finally understand what it means to return home from a young age. Because there are many chores in life, you will get old when you are busy. When you have time to go back to your hometown to have a look, the times have changed.
This hotel should be comparable to the luxury hotel Moji. I lived in Xunji in Macau, and it feels a bit like it. The dimensions of the room are large, the space is large, and the interior decoration and bedding are luxurious. Then it should be the hotel with the highest viewpoint in Shenyang, with a panoramic view of the mountains. The service staff are quite generous, including the cleaning lady. After all, is it Shenyang?
There is also a nice restaurant and lounge in the lobby. I can't find anything wrong with it, I hope to come back again, especially when it snows in the Northeast, to see how Shenyang turns into an old Beijing.

msg:When I arrived at the hotel, I was told that the room had not been cleaned. I was really speechless. I had booked many days in advance, but when I arrived, I was told that the room had not been cleaned. The most important thing is that the guest in the room cannot be contacted and told me that I have to be contacted. I said that if you have been unable to contact us, will we not be able to check in? That's when I said to knock on the door. .
The phone of the person who picked up the station was set so that it was impossible to make calls. I called him 24 times but no one answered. Finally, I sent a text message to ask him to call me back, and he only answered me. And there was no apology at all.

Then go to afternoon tea, there is a large group activity, I said that I have booked the afternoon tea time in advance, he told me you go to eat with that group, I repeated it at least three times, I am not with them , then tells me there is no location. I went to communicate with them again, and I said it again, I was not the service staff with them, and they scolded me loudly. At this time, I found the hotel manager. After the hotel manager came, the attitude of the service staff of the afternoon tea was still very bad. He had problems communicating with the manager of the hotel. He couldn't understand what the manager said to him three times. Then I asked to deal with the service staff, and I haven't given me the result so far.
My courier arrived in advance, but when it arrived, I was told that I could not find it. Then I took out the SF Express receipt, and I found it when I saw that it was indeed the signature of the concierge depar**ent.
The only thing I am satisfied with is Jasmine at Lian restaurant. His service is really good, with a smile on his face all the way, and he is very sincere. I praised him on the spot, and he said it was his honor. I really can only say that this is the only service staff I am satisfied with, but there are also things that I am not satisfied with. After the meal, we are signing the bill. This is in advance with the hotel manager. I agreed, but in the end my deposit was still deducted. It's really hard to say...

Because I am a diamond member of Ctrip, I was really happy to be told that I was upgraded to the executive floor for free. There will be foreign singers singing here at night, very international, and many people bring children to stay here.
Service: Very friendly to children, the little yellow duck set of toiletries ➕ children's slippers and bathrobes with very good texture are really considerate. When checking out, I also gave the child the brand mascot Little Tiger. The baby is very happy because he has collected many JXWs from the hotel.

msg:A friend recommended us to stay at Conrad Shenyang. The check-in was arranged by Sylvia, the guest relations director. She was very gentle and patient, and helped us introduce the hotel. The room arrangement was also very good. We also gave welcome fruit, and the shower gel in the room smelled good too. It smells good, but it's not easy to press. There's no shampoo in the sink. It's a bit troublesome, but I'm satisfied with everything else. Ms. Elena gave us drink coupons from the bar when we checked in. The bar also has live music at night. The a**osphere is really good. It was very good. I saw a beautiful sunset when I was waiting for the buffet at night. I was very grateful to Clara and Mia for calling a taxi when I checked out. I also recommended other rooms in our hotel. I will definitely come to experience it next time !

msg:A few days ago, I came to have afternoon tea with my friends☕️ and wanted to experience the accommodation here. Seeing that this place opened not long ago, I booked a double bed room for one night with the attitude of giving it a try, and checked in at the room on the 73rd floor. 88 The lobby of the building is very cozy. You can see half of Shenyang City. When you check in, you just catch up with the sunset. The scenery is beautiful. The layout of the room is very good. I like it. The breakfast is at the Wenguan restaurant on the 88th floor. The overall is not bad , Woke up early and watched the Sunrise Beef Noodle Potato Cake. During the stay, I would like to thank Manager Steven for his warm hospitality. It is a very recommended hotel.

Clara and Wiley who checked us in are very warm and kind. Thank you for your attentive and professional service. ! I would also like to thank Cloris and Bella in the executive lounge. They are very nice and gave a small gift "Kangkang" to the children. My daughter likes it very much and is very happy. This time I mainly brought her to swim. I personally feel that the environment of the swimming pool is average. However, the variety of breakfast is still very rich and the taste can be regarded as making up for some of the overall 95+ points. I will choose to stay at the Conrad Hotel if I have the opportunity in the future!

Lester took the initiative to prepare the room layout and birthday cake for me. When I entered the room, the TV also played the birthday Blessings, it really exceeded my expectations. I am very happy to have a good memory at the Shenyang Conrad Hotel. I also thank the eldest sister of the room depar**ent for their hard work and help with the decoration. Their service can exceed my expectations and leave me a good memory I am deeply impressed, the location of the hotel is very superior, and I will come again if I have the opportunity in the future.

msg:We came to Shenyang to play on the weekend and chose to stay in Conrad's executive double room. Because I checked in after three o'clock in the afternoon, I went directly to the executive lounge to enjoy afternoon tea.

The executive lounge is on the 83rd floor, with a very nice view and very quiet. There are a variety of desserts, salty points, and juices to choose from. After a simple meal, we went out for a stroll.

When I returned to the room at night, I found that welcome fruit had been placed in the room and the bed had been turned down. The hotel's environment and facilities are really new and very good. The toilet is Toto's washlet, and the toilet is byre. Here, I would like to thank Cloria and Bella for their thoughtful service and small gifts❤️

msg:Very rubbish experience,
1. The light at four o'clock in the middle of the night was broken and flashed. I called for maintenance and didn't come for a long time. After I arrived, I said the imported lights were always broken.
2. The voltage was unstable and the chargers of mobile phones and watches burned out.
3. The bed sheets were not changed when I extended my stay. The wine glasses used the day before were not replaced. I asked room service to change the bed sheets. The waiter kept talking on his mobile phone.
4. There is someone at the concierge at the door, but they don’t help guests with their luggage.
5. When the front desk reported a complaint, the staff’s first reaction was: If they don’t help you with your luggage, what time did you come? Add WeChat for next time discount. (WeChat is the privacy of the guests. Is this method really appropriate??? And with this quality, who would want to do it next time??)

msg:Hilton's luxury hotel, the world's highest Conrad brand hotel, the hardware and design are good, but the service feels like a fake Conrad, the breakfast is not greeted, the front desk service is average, there is no enthusiasm, I stayed for 3 nights in a row, I asked to change the sheets halfway and was told to try my best. Could it be that the occupancy rate is too high? not enough? After the epidemic, in the environment of the recovery of the service industry, there are indeed a lot of hotel guests. There is still a card on the bedside table that says "If you need to change the bed sheets, please contact us." As a result, I went to the 88th floor and asked for a change... After returning to the room, it was obvious I didn't change it, and I don't know the reason on the last night. After swimming, I went back to the room to take a bath at night, and the bed sheets were itchy all over. The inner thighs were scratched with red marks. I don't know if it's my allergies or hygiene reasons. I got up too late the next day and left in a hurry so I didn't have time to give feedback. The bathtub didn't feel very clean. The spare parts were in large bottles of Braide, the same brand as InterContinental. It was in Shanghai Beach before. The hotel's decoration hardware is good, with double basins Advanced bathroom configuration, TOTO's smart toilet, and a very comfortable mattress. Equipped with a capsule coffee machine, the minibar is quite rich, the room area is 60 square meters, and there is a round bathtub by the window, but the double bed booked through the Hilton app for the next two nights is not available, and Conrad, as a luxury hotel under Hilton, is equipped with farmers The mountain spring feels a little pricey. It used to be Tibet Glacier 5100, but now it may be hit by the previous epidemic to save money, but it’s okay to get a hundred-year-old mountain. I think the biggest highlight of the hotel is the gym and swimming pool. The lighting and scenery are good. The Italian Technogym used for the equipment, the shower room in the swimming pool locker room is well done, and the locker room is equipped with a Dyson hair dryer. The location is good, in the city hall Hang Lung, No. 1 Qingnian Street, Middle Street, and the Forbidden City are all nearby. The western food in Lian Hall on the 88th floor of the hotel is not bad. I hope the hotel will get better and better in line with the economic recovery.

The service staff thoughtfully presented a children's travel little yellow duck washing set. When you enter the lobby, the staff will ask if you need help with luggage. Transfer to the 88th floor Take the elevator 🛗 Someone will help you press the elevator to guide the floor. The decoration design style of the guest rooms can be regarded as one of the best, with a simple European style. The comfort of the bed was fine. ⚠️🉐️But the cushions on the small sofa in front of the bed suggest that the hotel replace them with pure cotton, leather, or other synthetic fibers, because the current sofa cushions are particularly irritating to the skin. I don’t know if it’s because of the wool material. Allergic reaction, I think this problem can be improved, because the cost of only changing the cushion is not so high. In the end, overall, the experience of staying in the hotel is satisfactory, and I sincerely hope that the hotel business will get better and better.

msg:The design of the hotel is good, but there is nothing outstanding for a hotel at this price. The hotel service is quite satisfactory. I called to confirm the reservation before I checked in. The voice of the wiring lady was sweet and bilingual, but the check in at the front desk agreed to be international. The service boy told me in standard Shenyang dialect that the room I checked in had not been cleaned and I had to wait after check-in. This is understandable. The hotel reception is on the 88th floor, and it was extremely hot in the afternoon. It was just after the new year, and we all wore down jackets , a lot of people, quite noisy, I was surprised that there are so many people in this price hotel, and I later found out that because many people booked rooms from the second landlord, the room was not even half the price of the platform, which was originally positioned as a high-end hotel The hotel felt like a guest house in an instant, but most of the second landlords had the highest room, that is, the executive room, but the hotel did not give us any preferential trea**ent for suite guests who booked through formal channels. On the contrary, if I did not offer to enjoy it The front desk did not intend to tell me about the trea**ent of afternoon tea and dinner in the hotel's executive lounge. When I saw that the front desk introduced afternoon tea and dinner to a guest in an executive room, I curiously asked why there were no suites. Reluctantly took out a piece of paper and introduced it to me.
 The design of the room is okay, but the equipment is a bit poorly maintained. The large shower was blocked so that there was no water. I cleaned it by myself. The bathtub is huge, but the water is very slow, and the temperature in the bathroom is too cold in winter, so we didn’t Enjoy, the tv above the bathtub was not working, I didn't notice it on the first day. Later, the engineering staff came and did not fix it. In the end, we couldn't turn it off, so we couldn't sleep with the TV on. Later, we had to remove the TV from the wall to unplug it. It is really touching that the hotel provides an air purifier. For the air in Shenyang, especially for children, this is very considerate, and I also asked for a humidifier, because the indoor air conditioner is heated and the air is very dry, but I want to ask How long has it been since you changed the filter element of your humidifier? I was too scared to use it. There should be more hooks on the walls of the room, not enough power sockets, and the charger can't be plugged in while sitting on the couch. The hotel's breakfast and dinner in the executive lounge are good and of good quality. The night view of the room is also very beautiful, because it is high. But the 270-degree window in the bedroom of the suite is really not warm, but the living room is warmer. I think it should be changed, because after all, the bedroom is still connected to the bathroom, so it doesn’t matter in summer, but who comes to Shenyang in summer? Isn’t it good to go to the beach? I need to deal with work in the hotel, and the hotel does not provide desk lamps. It is quite satisfactory. Next time, I will not spend money to live in a suite here. It is fine to live in an executive room. The details are really not in place

As a result, my friend checked in three hours later than me, and the floor was much higher than mine. And this time the room on the shady side was a bit damp, I don't know if it was booked by Ctrip and it was given a worse room.
The cleaning aunt is very enthusiastic but not very professional. Since I live with friends, I asked for an extra quilt, but the aunt didn't get my consent. After I opened the door, I walked into the room and put a quilt on me. In the end, she explained that there was not enough space in the equipment room to cover her with a quilt...

msg:The location of the hotel, the business, the convenience of transportation, and the surrounding environment are very good,
And as the tallest hotel in Shenyang, the scenery is nothing to say, whether it is the lobby, lobby bar, restaurant, executive lounge or gym, you can see all the small mountains from the window. The night view is limited by the overall lighting effect of Shenyang. Ordinary. The overall is good, especially the hardware facilities, it should be at the top3 level in Shenyang.
If you have friends who read the comments, please ask the following to give some opinions to the hotel. It’s not that Conrad is not good. I personally recommend it very much, but I still hope that they can get better and better and bring you a better stay experience. .

As a luxury brand of Hilton, Konrad still needs to pursue the ultimate experience. The service of Konrad Shenyang has a lot of room for improvement. Here are a few suggestions for your company:
- There are many barbecues in Shenyang, which can easily bring a strong smell of smoke to the clothes of the guests. This really affects the mood. If the hotel can prepare some deodorant sprays, it must not be that kind of cheap fragrance. The customer’s service is a bonus, but I took the initiative to ask for it, no, and I didn’t express my apology, let alone ask or search for me (at least I have experienced similar services in Four Seasons and Ritz-Carlton)
- The cafeteria experience on the 88th floor is terrible, which may be related to the large number of people during the Spring Festival, but there are many improvements, such as no dental floss prepared, the coffee needs to be made by the guests themselves, and the fresh milk is not nearby, the welcome area and baking The area is crowded together, people are crowded, the design of the restaurant's circulation is unreasonable, it is too crowded, there are obviously seats inside, but there are many people queuing outside (maybe it is the Spring Festival, the manpower is tight, I understand)
-The slippers in the hotel are actually white brand. Doesn’t Conrad embroider the logo? , slightly embarrassed
- The room is only natural water from Nongfu Spring (the hotel with the red label is exclusively available), it is recommended to consider providing mineral water
- The hair dryer is too low, it's too difficult to use
-Toilet paper is hard and thin, poor
- The elevator experience is extremely bad, the wind is whistling, and sometimes the elevator door cannot be closed, and it needs to be pushed by hand. How is this elevator shaft designed?
- Some waiters need to strengthen their service awareness. Sometimes it is not intentional, but they naturally show the feeling of not knowing the service. For example, I called the front desk to ask what time to check out at the latest, and told me 12 o'clock. I thought I would stay The administration can return at 2 o'clock or even 4 o'clock. Of course, during the Spring Festival, the room is tight and I understand it, but the front desk told me straight away that I have to leave at 12 o'clock today, but they didn't tell me the reason or express sympathy. They just told me I told the truth, but I didn't say the reason, and I didn't even say sorry; but the cleaner I met when I checked out was very nice, and greeted me proactively, asking me if I would like to bring two bottles of water
I am also engaged in service experience. I hope your company will get better and better, and I hope to have the opportunity to communicate with each other.

msg:I haven't been to Shenyang for several years due to the impact of the epidemic. I have lived in the Grand Hyatt above the Vientiane City before, but this time I thought about changing and chose Conrad. The hotel is located on the 88th floor, overlooking Shenyang. It is very considerately equipped with electric curtains, full of ritual. The overall facilities are very nice. Special thanks to Xie Yaoxin at the front desk for providing children's toiletries and small toys for the baby. Let me talk about the disadvantages: 1. Maybe because there are more people staying and dining during the Spring Festival, there is a queue for breakfast. 2. The hotel shares a parking lot with Hang Lung downstairs, it is not easy to find the location of the hotel and it is difficult to find a parking space near the hotel. The overall experience is 5-star praise.

msg:It's a great hotel. I came to Shenyang on a whim, so I booked Conrad at random. It was surprisingly good. The hotel lobby is on the 88th floor, with a 360-degree view of Shenyang. This elevator is a bit of a complaint. I don’t know why the wind pressure in the elevator shaft is so strong that you can hear the wind from far away. Entering the elevator is like entering a laboratory with a wind curtain😅. Other than that, I am satisfied. Although it is my first time here, the manager Zhao at the front desk upgraded the room with a wider view. I checked in quite late. The latex pillows brought by the staff will be delivered soon. The service is highly praised 👍🏻.
The facilities are basically brand-new, and the non-smoking floor where there is no smell of smoke. I sat in the lobby bar at night, and the drinks were ok. The only thing is that the edge seats are too far from the bar, and there is no pager. I have to wait for a long time to order something. I suggest improvement.
Conrad Shenyang is good, I will come again next time

msg:A very satisfying itinerary. I read the reviews in advance and must book an executive floor. It is very valuable, especially when the schedule is not tight. Downstairs is the newly opened Shenyang Museum, which is worth a visit, because I took my mother and daughter with me and returned to the hotel after shopping for a while, just after four o'clock to have some afternoon tea. I originally booked the buffet on the 88th floor, but I didn't expect the afternoon tea to be delicious. The elderly and children didn't want to move, so they went directly to the executive floor for a free dinner, saving half of the room fee.
The swimming pool and the breakfast are quite satisfactory, and they are all good. I lingered until almost noon the next day before going to the Forbidden City. I directly helped to extend the check-out until 4 o'clock. I was really satisfied, so I booked another day for the return trip tomorrow, and planned to simply rest for another day. go home.

msg:1. After check-in, the hot water in the room was obviously rust-yellow with a strange smell. We were hungry and carried our luggage across 3 floors, and changed 4-5 rooms in a row (the hot water was still yellow and rusty or the smell of smoke was very strong). The whole process took more than 1 hour. The front desk only ordered the concierge to lead the way by phone, and did not apologize in person, which made the first impression of check-in very disturbing. 2. On the day of check-in, the executive lounge and all catering were closed. The trea**ent of the executive lounge changed to poor food delivery experience, and the food was unpalatable. However, there was no notice when the lounge was opened the next day. I found out by myself that I could not follow the administrative rules when I left the hotel. The trea**ent time is delayed until check-out at 4 o'clock, and the overall administrative trea**ent is about no. 3. The cleanliness of the room is mediocre, you can't look at it carefully, it's rough. 4. The elevator in the hotel is extremely windy, and the experience is not good every time you go in, and it takes a long time to get used to the ear pressure every time.
Its advantages are that the high-rise scenery is acceptable, the transportation is convenient, the breakfast beef noodles are delicious, the swimming pool experience is good, and the general service attitude is good. There is a high probability that you will not choose Conrad next time you go to Shenyang.

In the toilet area and along the wall, it can be seen that there is dust that has not been cleaned for a long time. Let’s not be picky about the front desk receptionist. He has a distinct Northeastern accent. It’s obvious that he hasn’t been trained in professional image and business etiquette for a long time.

If a certain part of the reserved afternoon tea has hygienic conditions or the waiter accidentally spills it, how do you reschedule the customer? The details are very poor, but the appearance is good! The service is quite polite but the details really make me want to give 10,000 negative reviews. The afternoon tea environment is even worse! Because the place for afternoon tea is a bar in the evening, it feels very dirty. It is not recommended to check in for afternoon tea alone. The experience is very poor.

msg:In what era did hotels charge arbitrarily and cheat customers just because their signboards were big? I stayed here for one night on a business trip from Beijing. I didn’t see any price list around the snacks placed in the drawer of the room (the customer service said they were placed on the refrigerator, but the refrigerator was not even next to the drawer. Customers had to use a magnifying glass to search for all the snacks in the room. (This is the clue to solve the case), I ate a small bag of dried cranberries, a small bag of nuts, deducted a 74 yuan deposit, and I also took pictures of this 30+ yuan bag of stuff. No one can afford to stay in this hotel without these tens of dollars. The important thing is the food and service attitude. I suggest you keep your eyes peeled when checking in. Don’t be fooled by such an arrogant hotel. Anyway, I have already complained to 12315. Let’s wait and see. In addition, the hotel’s hygiene is not very good. There are other people’s hair in the bathtub and toilet. The shell is broken and the carpet has a peculiar smell. If I hadn't been charged an exorbitant amount, I wouldn't have bothered to leave a negative review.

But this time, the experience was different. I originally wanted to try the executive room, but when I checked in, I was unexpectedly upgraded to the room type. Thanks to Manager Liu Chuang from the front office, he was very enthusiastic and was fortunate to live in the classic suite. The spacious and comfortable room, the most important thing is that the bathtub and the scenery are perfectly combined this time, making an extraordinary and unforgettable memory. The cleaning of the guest room is also very serious and responsible. Thanks to Haiping and Sibo from the middle class, as well as the staff who forgot their names. In short, this is a perfect stay, and I will still choose Conrad, the best hotel in Shenyang for my next return.

I have to say that Conrad Hotel has given me a different experience, and all the facilities are the ceiling of Shenyang Hotel. But the most important thing is service and details. I couldn't find my pajamas and vest yesterday. I told the front desk when I went out today. When I came back, I saw the vest on the side of the bed, which was very heartwarming. It turns out that I accidentally brought the vest into the cardboard box before, so I couldn't find it for a long time. Later, Aunt Shao found it for me. He also left me a note, I feel very embarrassed and very grateful. In addition, Aunt Shao was very careful. I couldn't find paper and pen in my work records before, so I took the dry-cleaning copy list and made a simple record with pencil. After seeing it, Aunt Shao left a blank paper and a pen for me after cleaning the room. Really, I just want to say, very, very good! ! !

I didn't expect to have a hotel with such good hardware and software in the north.
Thank you to your room staff Zhang Ling and Wang Shujie, their excellent service is one of the best that we experienced hoteliers have ever seen.
There are also food and beverage staff (including waiters on the executive floor), and the breakfast table, materials and service are also very good.
The bartender in the lounge is very considerate and can adjust the bartender formula at any time according to the requirements of the guests, Good job.

The five-star hotel in the center of Shenyang has a convenient location and convenient shopping. Hang Lung is downstairs. If you want to buy something, go downstairs. I went there. The executive room that I booked comes with afternoon tea and two breakfasts in the lounge, so the price is more expensive and the price/performance ratio is super high, and the service is not to mention.

msg:Everyone must be sure to make it clear that this Condor Hotel is unlike anything you have stayed at in Shanghai and other places. The service management is speechless. I booked a classic suite, but it was still non-cancellable. As a result, I was told that it was not cleaned at the time, and I couldn't check in until 6 p.m. Check in, isn’t it outrageous? Then I asked for an electronic invoice. I asked for it for a whole day, but there was no result. I didn't ask for it at night. No matter what age it was, the hotel wouldn't issue an invoice. Therefore, for a hotel of the same brand, everything changes when you arrive in the Northeast, and the service is the same as that of an express hotel. I hope the so-called leaders of the hotel can open their eyes and read this comment. Is it because you didn't do your job well that the system is so bad, or because the staff just don't understand.

The next day, the eldest sister who took over during the day was told to clean it carefully again. We were leaving to catch the early flight at 6:30. I went to have breakfast after the meal started. The waiter at the restaurant I said to bring some food for the child was also enthusiastic to help, and everyone in the executive lounge saw that we were bringing the children with all kinds of enthusiasm. The noodle chef was afraid of the original noodles. Spicy specially made pork ribs soup for my son, the details are too in place, we booked the classic suite, the large bathtub in the bathroom is also amazing! This time I passed by Shenyang because Conrad's service and hardware were perfect!

❤️I have always liked the brand of Conrad very much. The accommodation experience at Conrad Shenyang made me feel as if I was back home~
🧡From check-in to check-out, no matter the room sanitation facilities, guest services or hotel catering, it gave me a super amazing experience~
💜Name and praise Miss Clara at the front desk! The front desk is just a little business card for the hotel, and it is very important to give the guests the first feeling. Throughout the stay, I felt the enthusiasm, professionalism and very attentive service of the young lady~
💙It will be very cost-effective to buy a set meal in hotel dining, there is no sloppy taste, and the products are also very beautiful~

💞I came to Shenyang for the first time, and I had a good experience in the hotel accommodation. If I have a chance to see you again in the future, I will still choose this Conrad!

And at three or four in the middle of the night, you can be woken up by the sound of the door closing by the person on the opposite side. The sound of flushing the toilet in the next room was too clear. I don't think the whole season should be so exaggerated...hey, I've changed my place.

msg:The hotel I choose every time I bring my baby to Shenyang, because the twin room has two 1.5-meter large beds, and a family of three sleeps very comfortably. It is not crowded at all. The breakfast is rich in variety, which can satisfy the taste of the family. The environment is new and not old. The high-altitude swimming pool is particularly well-designed. The rest area, children's pool steps, and infinite photos are also beautiful. When you stroll downstairs in Hang Lung, you can occasionally find bags that you can't buy in other stores. There are not as many people in the mall as Vientiane City. The service staff at the front desk is remarkable. If you remember correctly, the room cleaning should be called Shao. Na, I want to give a special compliment. I wanted two bottles of mineral water. After I sent it, I noticed that I was taking my child. I also sent children's toiletries, slippers, and toys for the little tiger. I was especially warm and asked if we lacked anything else. Like my aunt, we kindly bid farewell when we check out. The enthusiasm of the service is more surprising and comfortable than the front desk. The beef noodles for breakfast are very delicious, and those who come here must try it😄

Whether you are a foreign brand or not, you should satisfy the appetite of Chinese customers when you come to China. The western food is more whole than the Chinese food, so I really served it. Bad review! ! !
The rest are all advantages, the environmental sanitation is very good, especially the service is impeccable. The bedding in the room is also comfortable enough! The night view is even more beautiful!
The restaurant must be improved! If you stay in your hotel next time, if this is still the case, then I will have a bad review!

msg:A great stay experience
I went there on May Day, so there were many people in the lobby. I booked a classic suite, and I happened to get a room on the 82nd floor in the northwest corner (it’s already the highest, and the 83rd floor is the executive lounge). The view is great, and it is indeed the highest in the north. of hotels
The guest room is very tidy and the bed is very comfortable and soft. I feel quite satisfied.
The actual hotel bathtub is very big and can even accommodate two people (complaining about the official photo taken by the hotel, the small one looks like a toy). The only drawback is that the water in the bathtub cannot be drained cleanly. There is still some residue the next morning. I hope it can be improved.
For breakfast, it was very rich. The beef noodles were made with huge pieces of beef. They almost beat all other beef noodles in Shenyang. The wontons were also very delicious. I even ate two bowls of them.

服務：酒店服務值得一提，辦理入住和退房前台的都是Elena，按照我的需求安排了滿意的房間，得知我是出差，退房還積極主動幫我叫好了車，十分感謝，酒店其他的工作人員也很熱情，都會主動問好

我們入住的當天時間比較晚差不多快夜裡十二點了。打了酒店之後空無一人，門口沒有接待禮儀，進了大堂有一個小的前台也是沒有了，由於是第一次入住也不清楚要坐電梯到88層才是辦理入住的前台。一層小前台也沒有指引，造成我們夜裡在樓下轉了好久最後還是和其他住客一起才成功辦理的入住。我們在入住期間多次出入酒店，一層有個禮儀不知道是不是酒店的，根本沒有任何禮儀服務，來來回回這麼多次出入一直在玩手機，更別提拉車門的服務了，在一層的小前台也是，多次看見顧客進來後直接低頭玩手機選擇忽視。和88層的前台服務差距太大了。整體入住還是很不錯的👍，下次來瀋陽會繼續選擇康萊德

本次入住也有一些問題，房間裏的電視機無反應工程部上門重新接線才恢復，浴缸電視無信號無法使用。吧枱的水池水龍頭出水不穩定，噴的到處都是。
大堂吧的下午茶味道配不上價格，各種甜品膠質感太重讓人覺得在吃卡拉膠和吉利丁片混合物，晚上酒吧表演的外國人唱中文歌有劉德華的味道，聽的很開心。入住過程中每一位服務人員都會主動打招呼，入住體驗大體能給85分，希望能拿出剛開業的水準繼續努力。

希望改進的是，吹風機還是很老式的，牙膏牙刷拖鞋洗髮水香皀毛巾之類的，都跟普通的酒店沒什麼差別，可以再上一個檔次更好。

環境：位置很好，市府恆隆樓上，去哪裡都還行，樓下隨時有車，去哪裡也不算太遠。
服務：前台很熱情，主動問居住體驗感，需不需要什麼，以及送小禮物。點名表揚一下幫我辦理業務和寄存行李的四位美女Elena！Vera！Jennie！Clara！

離開時酒店1樓SongZhou 小哥哥也是全程幫忙放行李開車門，並且解答我的問題。謝謝☺️

酒店環境典雅別緻，工作人員服務態度特別好。尤其是為我們打掃衞生的馬阿姨，每天都盡心盡力的為我們的房間清潔，及時補上水和嗎，紙沐浴產品，每晚也會為我們開好夜床，讓我們一回去就能夠安穩入睡。
總之，下次來瀋陽還會選擇下榻康萊德。

游泳池沒有傳説中的那麼神奇，很小，也並沒有“無邊”，不過勝在人少。

唯一不方便是外賣衹能放在一樓，而且不管送，每次都要大費周章的換電梯去取，美中不足。

提個小建議：浴缸溢水口處有上位客人殘留的花瓣，浴缸內側有小部分異物，請強化House Keeping的管理；Bathroom的對拉門在合上以後，門框處有縫隙，若能改進，會更贊…

滿分5分的話，可以給到4.85分。

服務：一個南方人徹底感受到了北方人的熱情，從剛到酒店那會兒，就有人開車門，酒店前台設在88樓，門口小哥就貼心的接過行李箱説送到房間。
再來入住時，遇到了打掃衞生的hong.ma阿姨，生怕找不到房間問住哪兒帶着我們到房間門口，入住三天時間每天都會貼心的鋪好床鋪，整理雜物。
最後，離開時禮賓部amy看到客人多直接幫忙收房卡問需求。
總而言之這酒店值得入住，畢竟一分錢一分貨，貴有貴的道理！！

    因樓層高，電梯間有些攏風，有嗚嗚的風聲，帶小孩的要做好溝通，避免被嚇到。
    在此入住期間服務員主動熱心，特別感謝禮賓部莉莉細心周到的服務，為我們預訂車輛並及時與司機師傅進行溝通，保證了我們的行程順利進行。感謝客房部邵娜，劉倩為我們提供的客房服務，及時，細緻。

服務：這是讓我最滿意的，旅行中突發眼鏡腿折了，工作人員幫忙找東西粘，而且前台的Monica Elena和Ivy小姐姐都幫了很多忙，到瀋陽肯定要買東西，冷藏東西也麻煩了餐廳的聞蕾大姐熱情幫助
雙人行政樓層禮遇:下午茶裏的西瓜汁和青瓜汁真的是家裡人的最愛

msg:酒店整體軟硬件都很好，住了兩晚體驗很好👍
硬件：酒店在市中心，交通很方便，打車🚗較為快捷，出門走幾百米旁邊商場也有地鐵站；酒店在88層觀景視野開闊，可以一覽市區眾樓小，房間內電動窗簾拉開景色也很棒🥳

軟件：酒店員工服務也很好，樓層經常看到大姐做清潔工作，馬姐很熱情主動打招呼，感覺很暖心；餐廳體驗也很好，Lisa服務超級好，可以看出她對這份工作充滿了熱情與激情，種種幫助和關心真的很温暖。非常好的一次住宿體驗，後續再來玩會首選瀋陽康萊德👍

酒店服務人員都很有禮貌，從門口迎賓小哥到餐廳服務員和房間打掃衞生的阿姨都很有禮貌。
早餐雖然品質不是太多，但是質量很好，也很新鮮！
唯一就是電梯裏面的扶手被弄壞了，可能跟五一人多有關係。
總之很好的酒店，值得推薦！

點評：我最近在瀋陽康萊德酒店度過了一個非常愉快的週末，我想分享一下這次難忘的住宿體驗。從一開始的預訂過程，到最後離店的時刻，這家酒店都給我留下了深刻的印象。

首先，酒店的地理位置非常優越，位於瀋陽市中心的繁華地段，周邊有許多購物中心、餐廳和娛樂場所，非常方便。同時，酒店距離瀋陽桃仙國際機場也僅有30分鐘的車程，出行非常便捷。

進入酒店大堂，我就被其豪華典雅的裝修風格所吸引。工作人員熱情友好，辦理入住手續的過程非常迅速。房間內設施齊全，床品舒適，讓我在忙碌的一天後得到了充分的休息。此外，房間還配備了迷你吧、咖啡機等便利設施，滿足了我的各種需求。

酒店的餐飲也非常出色。早餐品種豐富，包括中式和西式的美食，口味地道。晚餐則選擇了酒店的中餐廳，菜品精緻美味，口感極佳。此外，酒店還設有健身房、游泳池等休閑設施，讓我在享受美食的同時，也能保持身體健康。

在這次入住期間，我還享受到了酒店提供的一系列優質服務，如免費接送機、行李寄存等。特別是前台的服務員，他們總是面帶微笑，耐心解答我的問題，讓我感受到了賓至如歸的體驗。

總之，我在瀋陽康萊德酒店度過了一段美好的時光，無論是地理位置、住宿環境還是服務質量，都讓我感到非常滿意。我相信，這裡會是我未來再次選擇瀋陽的首選酒店。如果你正在尋找一個舒適、便利且高品質的住宿體驗，那麼瀋陽康萊德酒店絕對值得你擁有！

酒店位置算是市中心吧，不論吃飯出行都方便。
樓下商場裏小飯館很多，還可以團購。
早餐品種比較豐富，尤其是Tracy Kang的服務，給予賓至如歸的感受。
因為視野好，每天起來心情也好，可以作為來瀋陽的首選酒店。

行政禮遇用了下午茶，服務員小姐姐態度很好。早餐正常水平，入住時候趕上酒店外圍玻璃清潔，在屋裡時候會比較注意。整體不錯，值得一住。

msg:瀋陽康萊德酒店處於瀋陽市中心，離故宮、大帥府、西塔、老北市等都在3km以內。樓下就是市府恆隆，附近還有多個商圈，吃飯購物出行都非常方便。88樓大堂風景獨好，酒店房間裝修美式風格，Wi-Fi覆蓋好。房間床軟硬度、枕頭高低剛好，四晚睡得很舒適。浴室硬件全TOTO，洗浴用品byredo瓶裝，支持環保。值得提一下，浴室配備電毛巾架，其他五星酒店目前還沒碰到。有點小缺點：吹風機不太行；房間備4瓶水太少。房間衞生打掃得快，中午回來休息已經打掃乾淨了。
服務：一到酒店門口服務員主動開關車門、送行李到房間。感謝前台辦理入住的孫經理，聽説沒訂到雙床套房且第一次入住康萊德，幫忙把房間升級到經典套房，享受了更大面積的房間和行政酒廊。辦理退房的曹領班得知要趕飛機，快速辦完退房，還送了臨別小禮物，謝謝。
早餐中規中矩，中餐較少，驚喜的是有鮮榨果汁和蔬菜汁。但有時早餐高峯，沒人引座，盤子不能及時收。
總體對瀋陽康萊德印象很好，去瀋陽還會選擇。

msg:酒店位置很好，從地鐵出來不用上到地面直接從恆隆廣場就可到達。商場有很多餐飲、超市，非常方便。酒店是附近最高的樓，視野很好。距離西關清真美食街也很近，所以沒有訂早餐。酒店旁邊就是瀋陽博物館，最後一天退房也有地方去轉轉。
酒店服務人員都很有禮貌，前台辦理入住退房都很快捷。樓層打掃衞生的阿姨都很認真負責，特別是馬姐。整體來説性價比不錯，下次來瀋陽還會入住👌

無論何時再來瀋陽，康萊德都是我的首選！

房間十分寬敞，不會覺得壓抑。雖然説瀋陽的夜景沒什麼太值得看的，高樓層遠眺還是可以的。

誇一下他們家的早餐，算是去過的酒店自助早餐中也是頂流了。可以跟北上廣的酒店pk了。
（順便吐槽一下，後一個星期住了廣州康萊德，那早餐怎麼回事，跟瀋陽康萊德比差距也太大了）

行政酒廊的工作人員（名字記不清了，抱歉），也是值得誇的，她真得記住我的姓和房間號。雖然我也就住了兩晚。

作為外地遊客，當在入住的酒店被認真對待，會讓你對這座城市的好感度也有提升，期待有機會再來瀋陽。

之所以説0.5 本來是打算給我退停車費的 後來提出我需要去找停車場重開小票的收據….1我沒時間 2本來也不多 10 20 元人民幣的  但我覺的 連續兩次連着的錯誤 我有必要追求自己的權利。後來經理 stevin給我退了 他私人給我退的

msg:520領爸媽來瀋陽吃飯購物，晚上不想回去了，找了找瀋陽幾大五星級酒店。
芊麗酒店在K11旁邊，挨着瀋陽展覽館，周圍沒什麼意思。
香格里拉老牌酒店，吃的周邊都很好，但是在別的城市都住這，沒什麼意思。
就選擇了康萊德，號稱瀋陽最高酒店，大堂在88層，停車在恆隆廣場b2層有直達到大堂的電梯。住宿在66-88。不在同一個電梯間，記得別走錯。
酒店地下車庫不太好走，入口比較隱蔽很容易錯過，要好好看路。
酒店1層直通恆隆廣場，可以看個晚場電影再回酒店。酒店夜景沒什麼好看的，瀋陽整體樓蓋的太密實了，鋼鐵森林一般。
酒店早餐比較差，不是5星級的水準，類似於亞朵吧。品種種類都很少，喜歡吃的小夥伴不要選這。
酒店服務人員都比較熱情，是東北人的熱情，有事兒您就問他們，準準的給回答到位。指路都恨不得陪你到你要去的地方。這點給他們點贊。
酒店清潔服務人員也很好，大爺大媽都熱情能幹給他們點贊👍
預訂酒店前可以看希爾頓小程序，這次攜程價格比官方價格還貴，還好我要積分，看了一眼，隨後攜程幫我找回來部分差價，但是在酒店渠道就可以積分了，攜程預訂的還是不划算。

衞生間的格局很不錯 防跌倒的扶手和椅子也安裝的很到位，就是拖鞋沾水之後在內個地面很容易滑倒 注意提醒大家一下尤其帶着長者小孩兒的。
地理位置在老市府（滴滴司機告訴我的哈哈哈）附近是個市中心，去哪兒玩兒都很方便，打車10+左右。

環境：酒店總體亮堂，很舒適。房間內窗户很大，採光好，方便白天晚上俯瞰城市風景。訂的行政雙床房間，房間面積不錯，特別是衞生間很寬敞，舒服。夜景真的很美！晚上一定要在88樓酒吧喝一杯，駐唱8點半開始唱。

設施：新酒店新設備，馬桶是自動的，毛巾架應該是可以加熱。浴缸設計的很好，住過酒店裡感覺浴缸使用最安全的，牆上的扶手很順手。健身房很贊，器材很全而且安靜沒什麼人，休息區域特別寬敞。

服務：住在80層，打掃衞生的阿姨服務很好，需要什麼東西火速送過來。

早餐有當地特色，餡餅挺好吃的，雖然菜品種類少一些，但是就當吃個好環境，在88層雲端欣賞風景吃早餐還挺舒服的。

樓下是恆隆廣場，還有ole超市，購物方便。

總之，很棒的一次經歷，鐵子們可以試一試。

msg:第二次打卡瀋陽康萊德酒店，因為上次入住體驗非常好，這次還是選擇了這裏。
辦入住非常的塊，前台一位姓宋的女士給我辦的入住，得知我第二次回來，給我升了級。非常開心！
本來打算晚上和男朋友去劉老根大舞台，但是可能因為週五的原因，網上和打電話都預訂不到前排沙發的票。就抱着試試態度問了88樓禮賓金鑰匙Jacky，得知我們非常想去後，他告訴我們會幫我們想辦法。留了我們聯繫方式後，告訴我大約10分鐘給我回信。
後來禮賓部Henry加了微信告知我，可以找人預訂到前排沙發區的票，除了取票費也不需要付額外的費用，另我非常的驚喜，不僅幫我取到票後還幫我預訂好了晚上去劉老根的出租車！
第二天禮賓部的周松在我退房後，也主動幫我拿行李，送到了車場，並幫我交了車費。
此次入住體驗非常好，感謝以上員工的細心安排，體驗到了管家式的服務！

客房都在60層以上，視野很開闊，美中不足的是瀋陽的夜景景觀燈不咋滴😂。
酒店的服務還是可圈可點，特別是前台，小細節都能反應服務的意識。有關洗衣的問題出了一個小插曲，但前台經理公關意識還是很強，順利解決，表示感謝！
行政酒廊的下午茶，位置好，景色好，服務好！酒店的早餐是唯一美中不足的，炒菜的品種太少，並且味道不好，整體偏西式。

酒廊某天美女服務員，不要把精力放在搭訕的客人上，好好乾活不行麼，親子家庭才是消費主力。
客房服務響應快，就是質量特別一般。想要浴缸套，答覆沒有，然後來了倆阿姨，拿個消毒液噴噴，告訴我一會放熱水沖沖就好。。。且不説那個東西的成分，味道刺鼻，最後自己費勁吧啦一頓刷。所謂的刷浴缸服務，不是噴噴而已吧？
可能風大，天冷，下車沒有行李生搬行李。
酒店泳池不錯，環境服務都挺好。

msg:1、服務配得上康萊德的品牌，前台、餐廳服務上都無可挑剔。唯一不足的是一樓門廳，發現部分門堂內的服務人員整個感覺還是太鬆。
2、位置上在二號線市府站，位於市中心，地鐵站直通樓下的恆隆廣場。恆隆負一樓非常寶藏，小餐食價格實惠也很好吃。
3、衞生上入住時發現水壺倒水口很臟，馬上給更換了並且有道歉。發現馬桶前有一些水漬，這點希望後續可以改進。
4、酒店配有1.5米雙床房型，對二胎家庭很友好，房間很大，高層酒店視野和光線都很棒，隔音也做的好。
入住價格肯定是全國康萊德的地板價了，總體覺得很值得。

msg:地理位置極佳，交通方便，很多景點可步行到達。酒店88層辦理入住，城市景觀一覽無餘，房間朝向很好，很乾凈整潔，設施齊全，床品舒服，下次還會選擇入住。
