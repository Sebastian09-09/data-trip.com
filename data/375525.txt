Yes, it probably needs some updating (bathrooms) but the room was comfy and clean and the price was really good for what we got.  Breakfast had a lot of choice.  We will probably stay here next time we are in Shanghai.

msg:The hotel was a good deal for the price. We stayed over the national day holidays, and we enjoyed our stay. The metro station is very convenient. I usually take taxis, but because it was just a 2-minute walk, I took the subway everyday. The breakfast was overpriced and nothing special, but luckily there are quality delivery options nearby. The bathroom had a tub, separate shower, and bidet on the toilet. Everything was very clean. When we slept in very late, the staff respected the "do not disturb" signs on the door and came back later in the afternoon to clean the room. Cara杨阳 at the front desk was also quite helpful and nice.

They answered my questions very patiently and gave me a lot of useful suggestions. No matter what questions I had, they always answered me with a smile, which made me feel the warmth of home. The room I was arranged was a room with a good view. In addition to the good service, the ladies were also very enthusiastic. I checked in in the early morning, and they took the initiative to help me carry my luggage up, and introduced me to the hotel's facilities and surrounding environment. Their enthusiasm made me feel no longer lonely in a strange city. The service of the ladies was really good, which gave me a deeper understanding and trust in this hotel.
The next morning, I wanted to send my luggage back, but I didn't know how to do it. Guo Han helped me mail it, and I am very grateful to her.
The environment and experience are super good, I highly recommend this hotel!

msg:I often go to Pudong for business. I used to stay in other hotels around. This time, I experienced Sunshine Hotel through the introduction of a friend. I didn't know it until I experienced it. I found that the hotel is really good. Whether it is the enthusiastic concierge brother at the door of the car, or the little sister with a sweet smile at the check-in front desk, it makes people feel happy. The cleaning aunts I met at the elevator entrance are very enthusiastic and greeted with a smile. I was even more surprised when I entered the room. The equipment and facilities are very well protected. It doesn't look like an old hotel at all (especially compared with the surrounding area, it is obviously good). It is quiet and the scenery is also very good. I slept beautifully for a night and looked forward to breakfast. Sure enough, it didn't disappoint. The service staff greeted me warmly with rich categories. I ate too much accidentally. When I checked out, FOM Wen patiently asked about the check-in experience and feelings. The service awareness was very in place. I also happened to meet Sales Liu who was waiting for customers. When time permitted, she took me to visit the banquet hall of the hotel. The introduction was very detailed. In short, this trip was really rewarding. I believe that the GM of the hotel must be very outstanding to bring out such a good team, with professional depar**ent managers and sales with good eloquence. I like Sunshine 👍 I will strongly recommend my friends around me to stay and hold activities here. This is the first time I have written so many comments (small essays). I will continue to support you😄

Later, I argued with him and did not pay the 300 yuan. The facilities are old, the socket of the bedside table is loose and no one is in charge, the hygiene is poor, and there are hairs on the towels, which is disgusting. When I returned to the hotel at night, I found that someone had inserted the door card, the light was on, there was an extra bottle of water on the bedside table, and a corner of the quilt was lifted. I asked the front desk and they replied that it was a night bed service the next morning. We have a twin bed room, but the other bed did not have this phenomenon. Does the night bed service only provide half of the service? It feels like someone else came in?

From the moment I got off the bus, the doorman helped me open the door and take the luggage. The front desk was also very detailed and quick to check in. Then the cleaning lady was also very careful to help us get an extra quilt, children's toothbrush and slippers.
The room was also clean, tidy and quiet. We stayed for two days and slept until 8:30 every day. We could see the Shanghai three-piece suit from the room window. The hotel has a rich breakfast, and I must praise the fruits. Watermelon, cantaloupe, pineapple and mango are all of good quality, fresh and sweet. Our family ate enough fruits for a day for breakfast, haha, everyone laughed!
The transportation is also very convenient. Turn left and 200 meters from the hotel gate exit is the Pudian Road subway entrance. It is very convenient to go to Nanjing Pedestrian Street, Lujiazui, Yuyuan Garden, Jing'an Temple, etc. It takes about 50 minutes to go to Disneyland by several subways. The Shanghai subway is very developed, and you can get anywhere quickly. Taxi drivers will accept orders quickly.

Oriental Pearl and Shanghai Three-piece Suite are nearby, and the subway is 200 meters away. It is very convenient to travel. I stayed in the hotel during the May Day holiday and booked two deluxe twin rooms. Because it was a family trip, the front desk manager Ding Jingru gave special care when checking in, and reminded me to dress according to the weather before the trip. I can also see the Shanghai Three-piece Suite in Antuo's room, which is really considerate. The overall stay is very good, I really like it. The service staff is very NICE, and they also gave small gifts to the children, which feels very warm. The hotel breakfast is also very good. I didn't expect to meet Manager Liu in the restaurant. I have been in Guangzhou before and chatted for a while. It's kind... There are many types of breakfast and the taste is also good. In short, I will recommend friends to stay and see Sinopec next time.

We stayed at Shanghai Sinopec Sunshine Hotel during the May Day holiday. We arrived at the hotel at 10 o'clock in the morning. After checking whether there were clean rooms, the front desk checked us in early. We booked a king-size bed room. Seeing that we brought children, we upgraded it to a deluxe king-size bed room for free. Lily, the lobby manager at the front desk, was very enthusiastic and gave the children a small gift of refrigerator magnets, which made the children very happy. The room service was also great. We stayed for three consecutive days and the room was cleaned very well every day. The shower gel, shampoo, moisturizer, etc. were all from Herborist. The mattress was particularly comfortable, more comfortable than my own mattress. The hotel is also close to the subway station (Pudian Station), which is very convenient for travel. There is a halal noodle restaurant and a Chinese restaurant on the third floor, and there are also Hutchison and convenience stores downstairs. In short, the experience is very good! Highly recommended. The child said that he would stay here again next time he comes to Shanghai.

In terms of hardware and software:

1. The lobby is still quite grand and well maintained. Although the decoration style of the corridors and the internal facilities of the rooms is relatively old, it can be seen that they are still well maintained. The internal facilities of the room are also great, clean and tidy;

2. The service is very good. Everyone is very friendly and polite. I have to mention the lobby manager Ding Jingru (Lily). Seeing that I came here early in the morning and was a little confused, she took the initiative to take me to handle the formalities. Because I arrived early, the room was not ready yet, so she helped me upgrade to a king-size bed room, and she was very warm and friendly. Thank you very much!

I will definitely choose Sinopec Sunshine next time. I used to stay at the nearby Sheraton Oil Oil Oil, and I have to say that the cost-effectiveness and hardware and software of Sheraton are not as good (the hardware is old and the maintenance is not good).

msg:This is a hotel that both the hotel itself and the Ctrip platform must rate highly.

I have stayed in many hotels in Shanghai, from the Peninsula Waldorf Astoria and the Mandarin Oriental to the old and new Jinjiang Garden Hotel. This hotel recommended by friends from the Petroleum Group in Shanghai is the best value for money and experience among all the hotels I have stayed in (of course the Mandarin Oriental is also very good). It’s really a change from the previous impact on state-owned hotels. The hardware and service far exceeded expectations. Of course, because the manager Shiwen and the hotel waiters were very enthusiastic when I stayed there before, the service this time was as impeccable as ever. Time has not affected its hardware and better services. It’s just that the network is unstable and there are still some water issues.

msg:On November 1, I went to Shanghai with my dad for a temporary stroll and found this store. This store somewhat relieved my discomfort caused by the crowds during the holidays. It can be said to be a treasure store that combines good looks and service. The room was just the right size, and the lady at the front desk warmly arranged a room with a view. Looking at the night view of the Magic City at night, I felt very beautiful. In the morning, as soon as I opened my eyes, I saw the peaceful magical city where I had rested all night under the blue sky and white clouds. There was no traffic and I was very excited. The breakfast is very rich, with many varieties. You can also make your own vegetable salad and fruit salad, which is great! And Li Xinyu is not only handsome but also very polite. Before leaving, he also gave us a gift prepared by the hotel. I was really happy. In short, it is a very cost-effective hotel.

Oh my God, I only stayed here because of the swimming pool. I was shocked that it looked very dirty. The slippers in the locker room were not disinfected and it was in B1. It was very, very small. , speechless, and in a very bad mood. You really need to choose a hotel with such a high price carefully. And the service attitude is not very good, I don't know what to ask. The waiter was rude and the experience was very bad. I will not come again. If I had to choose between All Seasons at the same price and him, I would definitely choose All Seasons

Environment: Not bad. I chose to stay here because I was going to the Oriental Pearl Tower for a meeting.

Hygiene & service: This really disappointed me...
1. The bed sheets were not changed for three days😡😡😡
2. I left at 8:30 in the morning and put up a sign asking for room cleaning. I also went to the front desk to notify them to help me clean the room and wash my clothes. I also paid the room fee for the extension. When I returned to the hotel at 14:30 in the afternoon, I received the sign I put up, but the room was not cleaned and the clothes were not sent for washing... Both towels in the room had yellow stains, so I couldn't use them, so I washed one myself and the other one is as shown in the picture.
I called the front desk, and they were all confused. I could only call the assistant manager, and they were even more confused...
My first request was that the assistant manager come to the scene. As a result, I waited for about 20 minutes (it was quite long anyway). A silly uncle (AM) came to the room with a lady in a black suit, looked around, waited to understand what was going on, and asked me if it was okay to fix it now? (He said he would reply to me later, but he never replied)
Stupid, I had guests in the room at that time😂😂😂
I said: I will do it after I go out for dinner
When I came back from dinner at 16:30, I happened to meet the manager on the floor, and the conversation became even more explosive...
Q: Sir, has the room been cleaned? (Speechless, do you not need to check in person when handling customer complaints?)
She said again: Because you put up the DND, we can't enter the room... (I swear... Because I went out, I put up the sign again for cleaning and told the front desk again. I don't know if the management of this hotel is so bad now? Worse is coming...)
After that, the hotel did not give any solution, nor did it respond...
When I left the hotel, I left the charger in the room. I called the front desk of the hotel. The front desk said that they would reply later, but there has been no news since then...
I want to ask the general manager of the hotel, is this the level of management of Sunshine? Is this the first hotel group to go abroad?
Oh, the management is too messy... (This is not my first time staying here, because I stay at Sunshine every time I go to Shanghai)
I didn't want to use this method, but you guys let me down...
Others complain anonymously, I complain with my real name...

msg:Due to work reasons, I stayed in a room at Zhongyou Sunshine for one night. How can I put it, the facilities are really a bit old, especially the bathroom, the water is very small, and the bathtub and shower are combined with a shower curtain. In fact, the bathtub and shower are both together. It's okay. The most important thing is that the bathtub is not big. Except for the bathroom, other facilities in the room are okay. The bed is very big and the pillows are too thin.
Let me tell you something bad after moving in. This really dampened my impression.
When I entered the room, I saw a menu. Heyi Chinese Restaurant on the 3rd floor had a set menu for two for 198. The food was good, so I was ready to go downstairs to eat.
When we arrived at the restaurant on the third floor, there was no waiter at the door. There was only a lady in a black suit who was talking on the phone standing behind the cashier. When she saw us, she extended her hand to signal us to come in. This attitude made me bow my head all of a sudden😳, and no She took us to our seats, and after we went in and sat down on our own, she walked over to find a waiter to greet me. Then I expressed that I wanted to order the 198 set meal, but the waiter said she didn't know, and asked the lady in black suit (probably the manager on duty that day) , the lady in the black suit asked the waiter to bring me the same menu. If diners not staying at the hotel can't see this set meal at all? The package doesn't say it's for hotel guests only, which is very strange.
Then I wanted to order orange juice, so I asked the lady in the black suit if it was freshly squeezed orange juice. I asked three times, I asked three times, I asked three times, and she was standing behind me taking the order. When I got to the airport, she answered me and said it was freshly squeezed. This attitude made me feel that she was quite impatient, and I seriously doubted that the orange juice was not freshly squeezed. At this point, I began to question the service attitude of the lady in a black suit. Later, during my meal, there was no water or service during the entire meal. You can hear the lady in black suit not far away talking on the phone or talking almost all the time. (This matter is not over yet. The more I think about it now, the more angry I am!)
In addition, I have to say that the food and taste are indeed good, but the service is terrible! Especially the lady in black suit who was on duty that day, I really felt that her service attitude was not good because I wanted to go to the restroom when I was about to finish eating. When I saw her at the door, I asked her where the restroom was. She stretched out her hand and said, " It’s right outside”, what’s right there! There are two sides outside at the end, so why don't you tell me clearly, turn left when you go out and turn left again! I was wronged again, and I was really convinced.
I'm not sure how many ladies in black suits were in the restaurant that day, but the one I'm talking about had a mid-parted low ponytail, and she was so pissed off. How terrible!

msg:I was traveling to Shanghai with my two children, and I chose to stay in this hotel for two nights. Not to mention the old hotel facilities, I was disgusted by the manager of the restaurant on the third floor of the hotel named Gao. I didn’t want to go far during the Dragon Boat Festival, and I saw the third floor on the table in the room. There was a set meal promotion in the restaurant, so I asked in advance. Maybe this behavior was misunderstood by the manager as a sign of poor people from other provinces. When we arrived at the restaurant, for unknown reasons, he ignored us and dominated other waiters to serve us. Even my son could tell that this uncle was unfriendly. He would not have come to eat here if he had known it. He spent money to buy a meal during the holiday. I was really angry and asked him if your hotel is a star hotel and that your service is worthy of it. Going to your hotel? Finally, a female manager came out to explain and said that we had misunderstood. I directly asked her to check the monitoring system to see if what I said was true. The female manager apologized to us and gave us a discount. It was really disgusting for me and the children to celebrate the holiday. It left a very bad impression in my heart. I will never stay in a hotel in Shanghai. Goodbye! I must give you the negative review that you have been thinking about. Manager ****, don’t look down on anyone. Serving every customer well is your job. May I ask where your sense of superiority in despising us comes from?

I went to the front desk to ask if there were mosquito coils. The front desk said there were no mosquito coils. I said there were mosquitoes in the room. The front desk said that there are indeed mosquitoes, but we don't have mosquito coils ourselves, let alone give them to you. Is it easy to say this?

msg:You need to scan the code to enter the store, but there is no polite language. Front desk staff listless at check-in, mechanical service. When changing rooms, I was told that I need to go downstairs to handle it myself, and no one sent the room card to the room. We had to go downstairs by ourselves and waited for almost 10 minutes without any apology from the front desk staff. When I met the staff in the lobby, I didn't take the initiative to say hello. There is no wet and dry separation in the bathroom, and the bathtub is high, which is very inconvenient if there are elderly people. The shower water is small, the momentum is weak, and there is water leakage. However, the room attendant was very nice when delivering water. The waiters in the restaurant are full of energy and polite. But the only downside is that some of the tableware will be taken away before the guests have finished their meal. Generally speaking, whether it is good or not is a matter of opinion. Let's experience it for ourselves!

msg:1. Many public toilets are blocked and no one is taking care of them.
2. Hotel staff treat online booking customers differently! Just like the incident at the Shanghai Auto Show of a certain horse, the person who booked online was a dog
3. The so-called lunch buffet is even more outrageous than breakfast. Only cakes are available, and the rest of the dishes are in short supply. It is even more outrageous than what beggars eat outside. The buffet that starts at 11:30 stops serving at 12:00, and there is no fried rice or white rice. No, the meat is only for a few people. The first few people took it, but the more than 200 people behind were missing. There were only a few vegetables per person. This was the first time that the restaurant was full of people. Everyone The plates are clean, clean and new, not empty after eating! After urging the on-site staff, we were still discriminated against, saying that the buffet was just like this, not what you country bumpkins and country bumpkins want to eat, and the staff looked at us like *****! *************, it’s Tian’en already, do you still want to eat?
4. Is this the kind of service attitude that Da Modu has? Sure enough, the price is five-star, the service is negative, and I look down on outsiders.
5. The facilities inside are old, is it still a four-star hotel? It is not as good as the starless hotels in Guangzhou, and the Changsha Airport hotels are better than it. Sure enough, foreign-related hotels only serve foreigners, not people from other provinces. It is better to just say that they are not allowed to stay if they are mainland Chinese. 99.9% of the hotel room price is used to serve foreigners and 0.1% is used to maintain facilities. Are you an inland country bumpkin? Sorry, you ****** don't deserve services!
6. I have been to Damodu Hotel several times for business trips, and this is the worst one. Have you ever stayed in a 3- to 5-star hotel? Is this one worth 4 stars? It is recommended that Chinese hotels re-upgrade their stars and not allow any messy hotels to have stars!
7. Since it is a foreign-related hotel, don’t let mainlanders stay there, and since it is given, don’t treat it differently.
8. When foreigners see the toilets clogged, they think, look at Shanghai, China, and say that it is a developed city in the world. With such an environment in China, who is embarrassed?

(Share a little experience: I did the elevator twice, and found that the other guests in the elevator were on the same floor as me. Then combined with the current epidemic situation, I guess the hotel may close some floors due to epidemic prevention requirements and cost savings at this stage, so now Non-weekend bookings of basic room types will most likely be upgraded if you stay in CNPC 🤤) All the staff are very enthusiastic, and the operation process is strictly in accordance with the epidemic prevention requirements. Personally, I feel that there is a slight flaw in it. It is necessary to change two elevators from the guest room to the swimming pool, and to walk through a short underground garage. Overall the hotel is very good and the price/performance ratio is high.

msg:To accompany the children to participate in activities in Pudong, I booked Midstream Sunshine nearby. The location is good. It is easy to find by car. It is also convenient to go to the subway station. There are several convenience stores nearby and there are many restaurants within walking distance.
The overall feeling of staying is very good, the front desk is a bit shy but the attitude is very gentle and very careful. The most impressive thing is that I went to the convenience store to return to the room and press the elevator the next day. I didn’t find the last elevator arrived. A gentleman with glasses just passed by to help me hold the elevator door and greeted me very politely, especially with service. Consciousness, the experience is very good, like it.
The room was clean and tidy, the bed was big, and the wife lived in a very spacious room. The housekeeping staff who came to turn down was also naturally smiling and polite although I didn't want turn down service. The room facilities are slightly old, there is a small hole in the sofa, and the pole above the bathtub is rusted. It will not affect the stay. If you can renovate it, it will feel better.
The thing that didn’t go smoothly should be parking. There is parking on the Internet. Actually, there are a few locations in front of the hotel. I saw a ba*****t. I asked if the underground garage can’t be parked. The security guard said “no” bluntly, but finally the door was vacant. Give me a place, because the traffic will pass by the place where I parked. I was worried that I would ask the staff at the door if I could put down the roadblock. On the surface, I agreed but didn’t move. I told me that everyone stopped like this. I can put my luggage at the back and side of the barricade. The two stood chatting while watching me. Anyway, I couldn't tell whether it was the security guard or the concierge. In addition, when my car stopped, no one came to ask me if I had any luggage. No one came to ask me during the time when I was there to fetch the musical instruments, fetch the suitcase and fetch the bags, but I hadn’t finished picking up a black car on the side. , Boy immediately went to open the trunk to help the gentleman in the car with his luggage. It felt too bad! ! Men now need more care than women and children. I don’t want someone to pick up the luggage, but this kind of favoritism makes people feel very uncomfortable. I would rather not provide service at the door, so as not to reduce the hotel’s points.

Since we were with two children, we had to wait more than an hour to clean up the room. The manager at the front desk immediately helped us upgrade the executive suite for free. The patient and meticulous service of Miss Li at the front desk made me feel very warm. Thank you both for their services. The room is super big, clean and tidy. The children run very happily in it. The staff at the front desk at check-out were very nice. The only minor shortcoming is that the breakfast variety is a bit small, and I hope that the hotel can add more breakfast varieties in the future.

Since the leaders of PetroChina stayed in the hotel during the CIIE, all services revolved around the leaders of PetroChina, completely ignoring other guests staying in the hotel. All employees paid attention to the services of the leaders and made arrangements at the store. A special person was in charge of the elevator, and a group of people entered the gate Standing in a row...staying for two days, I forgot the charger when I left the store. I told the front desk. After waiting in the lobby for a long time, no one told me whether I found it or not...Finally, I have to ask again. The front desk said I didn't find it, how could it be possible, I just went downstairs to check out and within an hour, I couldn't find it! !

Disadvantages: The sound insulation is very poor, any sound from next door or outside can be heard clearly.
The shower has to stand in the bathtub and the bathroom is very crowded.
Having windows but not being able to open them equals a closed space and feels very stuffy.
The bed is very soft and the pillows are very hard, making it difficult to feel comfortable.
The alarm clock set by the previous guest at 5:34 in the morning was not turned off, so I was woken up by the alarm clock in the early morning.

1. 享受了免費升等服務
2. 升等之後的房間挺大的, 挺舒適
3. 就這個價位的五星酒店來說, 性價比還是挺高的
4. 附近走一段路可以到世紀匯, 吃飯挺方便
5. 世紀匯旁邊就是世紀大道地鐵口

畢竟酒店有些年紀了, 會有些不盡如意的地方
1. 浴室應該是地磚的斜坡沒有抓好角度, 會有積水的問題
2. 外賣會送到1樓禮賓部, 要自己去拿(沒有機器人或服務員協助送餐)
3. 外送員可能會將餐點送到後門的外賣自提點
4. 可能是樓層太高, 所以手機的行動網路不大好
5. 就五星酒店來說, 大堂前的車道有點小, 如果旁邊停滿車又會顯得更小

總結來說, 就這價位能在市中心住到五星酒店, 已經沒有什麼好嫌的了
除非有差不多價位的新五星或四星酒店出現

找個五星級酒店休息一下，性價比較好，飲食要方便，環境也要好。散步到周邊的竹園，騎上共享單車到世紀公園5分鐘。
在世紀公園散步2小時再回賓館，可以享受上海的繁華和世紀公園的滿園春色，正是兩全其美。

樓層的服務員特別好，特別是28層，很親切，

實名點贊前台 林寒雨，幫我找了半小時的外賣並且送上來，態度非常好，真正做到了為客人着想
在找外賣的過程中，因為外賣沒有任何標識，找起來特別困難，她跑了三四個地方，把外賣櫃都一個個打來看，找了很久以後直接送到了客房，這種服務態度令人感動
後續出差還會選擇中油

詢問時不面對，專注自己手裡的活。帶走咖啡也不幫客人準備了，就提醒一句咖啡機在後麪（意思自己倒吧）。

確實如同事説的，“最近不好了”。以前的温馨沒有了。什麼時候降星級了？

幫我們辦理入住手續的是一位大叔，他很耐心的查看了預訂訊息，為了滿足我們提出在房間想看到浦東三件套，免費升級到高樓層的房間。隨後進到房間後非常滿意，衞生很乾凈。瞬間就緩解了因上海一直下雨又悶熱帶來的不好情緒。晚餐在酒店三樓清真餐廳，服務員態度很熱情，推薦的食品也很好吃。次日自助早餐品種豐富，出品也好。推薦朋友可以放心預訂。

附近有些小吃的餐廳,中國銀行及工商銀行,渣打銀行,建設銀行等走路幾分鐘內到
離外灘及南京東路地鐵站,只有幾站,需要在世紀大道站換乘
因為來上海幾次,沒啥想跑的行程,想說待飯店內,看看電視
這電視節目真讓人吐槽,這多家衛視難道都放舊片嗎?
還是現在那些唱歌的,旅遊的節目等,都沒啦......
總覺得除了新聞,財經有點時事,其他的都落後了,CNN還是2022年的重播
沒想到,會這樣咧....飯店沒錢付節目,還是....
所以,年輕人都是看手機吧~~

也有些問題，外賣沒有配送上樓服務；卧室床是兩個單人床拼在一起，上面又加了個墊子，睡感很差，對不起自己的星級，衞生間非常狹小，淋浴甚至衹能站在浴缸裏，這個真的是比較差了。
總體上，勉強算舒適。

我是大約清早六點左右攜程下單續住，八點左右到前台，前台小夥子説查不到訂單，電話給預訂部，這個正常。之後花了應該有十分鐘，這個不行那個核對，我都説了我有點急事，預授權也足夠，先把房卡延期剩下慢慢處理，他還是慢條斯理，最後還要我刷卡，連邊上人都提醒他去查一下上次住宿底單。前台培訓要到位。
