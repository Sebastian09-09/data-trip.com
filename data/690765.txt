msg:Front desk - the service was average because staff just seemed very unhappy. The lady that assisted us was very kind, until she did not know something, she asked her colleagues and they were very reluctant to assist her. I felt so sorry for her but she managed to work her way around completing the check-in. 

Room - air conditioner was weak. Only had 1 shower gel and 1 shampoo, yet it was a twin bedroom. No slippers when we checked in. The floor was dirty because of the wall concrete coming off. 

Not the best place to stay for foreigners that cannot speak mandarin. 

Location is perfect for going to the beach and it’s not far away from the airport.

msg:The location was great, but be advised that the hotel is right opposite the graveyard, so you get to go through the graveyard to the beach. 
Shower cubes are do not close tightly, which makes water run throughout the bathroom when bathing.
Cleaners were not cleaning under the beds. It was always dusty and sandy. 
The rooms are not soundproof, so you get to hear all the noise, despite being on one of the top floors. 
Breakfast was good, quite a variety, and the hospitality was great. 
Surrounded by many restaurants and the hotel has a lot of activities for families including an outdoor movie screen near the pool. n

I wanted to give this hotel 5 stars but die cleaning of the room was not up to standard...they didn't change my bedding or towels for the whole week that I was there, they would even fold up the wet towl and put it back in the cupboard. They didn't give me clean coffee cups for the whole week, I had to go buy stuff to wash it myself.  Most days they came after 15:00 to clean my room which was dissapointing if you want to take a rest.

msg:1. Good location.
It is close to Phoenix Airport, and the taxi is 13 yuan. It is across the road from the beach, and it takes about 10 minutes to walk from the hotel to the beach.
2. Enthusiastic service.
I checked in with two elderly people and a child. My personal plan changed, so I temporarily added an adult. The front desk staff Li Changxuan was enthusiastic, patient and meticulous. He quickly adjusted and checked in smoothly. The room was in a good location and I could see the sea view while lying on the bed. The room attendant Hu Haiyu worked seriously and meticulously, had a good service attitude, was enthusiastic and polite, and was able to communicate well. The room was cleaned in time and cleaned tidy. I was very satisfied with the two services. I sincerely ask the hotel to praise them and give them material rewards. Their good service adds points to the hotel.
3. Facilities.
The hotel is a bit old, and the equipment and facilities can be seen, but it is acceptable. Please update and upgrade the hotel in time.
4. Swimming pool.
The swimming pool is okay, the water is clear and clean, and there are not many people swimming during the stay, so I am quite satisfied.
5. Breakfast
There are fewer types of breakfast and fewer varieties. To be honest, there are not many favorites, but it can be eaten. I look forward to adding variety and quality.
The overall evaluation is okay. I will stay here again if I have the chance. I hope the hotel can further upgrade and improve its catering services and equipment facilities to provide better services for travelers.

To go to the beach opposite the hotel, you need to pass through a cemetery. The breakfast was also very average, and there were a lot of small flying insects in the pastry area... I originally wanted to choose a better hotel in the last two days to relieve the fatigue of travel, so I chose a sea view hotel among the five-diamond hotels screened on Ctrip. Unexpectedly, So bad! too poor! I really don’t understand how these two hotels achieved the five diamond standard.

The bellman didn't see me. I was dragging my child, my suitcase, and my big bag. No one helped me from check-in to check-out. A water slide is a waterside slide. Anything related to children that I marked in red does not exist. Even the slippers took a long time to find from room service before they were delivered. It's very close to the beach in a straight line, but you have to walk to the sea channel to actually get to the beach.

msg:1. The room is very small and it feels like I can’t turn around.
2. The sound insulation is very poor. When I want to take a lunch break during the day, there are all the noises of decoration outside. The room is very close to the elevator. The noise of children in the corridor before seven o'clock in the morning is really annoying!
3. You need to make an appoin**ent in advance for the airport drop-off. When you arrive at the hotel door, you will see half of the seats in the airport drop-off car are empty and you will not be allowed to get on.
4. There are many holes in the ceiling of the room, and the shower head in the shower room keeps dripping.
5. The breakfast room is so-so. The employees chatted lazily and did not greet the guests. They also held things with one hand at the entrance without any greeting. They swiped the room card and did not say a word.
6. I didn’t feel any service at the front desk. All in all, it's just so-so. As a tourist, I will not choose this hotel again. And it's far away from the bus station and so on.
7. Hair on the bed is the most intolerable thing.

msg:I have been to Sanya many times and I have stayed in the worst hotel, bar none. I am totally sorry for the price of more than 500 yuan a night. I was supposed to stay for two days, but I decided to check out after one day. The hygiene was really dirty, I couldn't bear to look at it. The room had peeling walls everywhere, there was a chewing gum-like thing on the balcony wall (it was really disgusting to see it), and there were a lot of mosquitoes at night. There is a swimming pool, which is not big, but there is really a lot of garbage in it. It only provides two very small bottles of water (355ml), and no more water is provided (this is the first time I have encountered someone who asked for water but was not given).
The facilities are also rubbish. As a resort hotel, there is a children's playground, but it only has the things shown in the pictures and there is no way to play at all.
The handle of the sliding door to the balcony of the room was wobbly and felt like it was about to fall off. Moreover, the sliding door was extremely difficult to pull, and it took a lot of effort to open it.
All in all, the experience was extremely bad and I will never stay there again.

Although it doesn't offer a free room upgrade like some reviews, it's generally pretty good. You can't hear the planes taking off and landing at night. There is a passage at the back door of the hotel to get closer to the beach, but you still have to walk for ten minutes.

msg:The room is clean and hygienic. We live in a sea-view double bed. There is only one bedside table in the room. I don't understand it, but it's not too important. The room has a balcony. You can sit on the balcony and watch the sea. The hotel is very close to the sea, just a few minutes' walk away. The hotel has a swimming pool, which is quite big and clean, and there are sling rocking chairs next to the pool.
The hotel's breakfast is average, but there is a Hainanese powder in the breakfast that is delicious. The TV in the hotel can't cast the screen, which doesn't work for me. The service of the hotel is mediocre, the air conditioner is leaking, and the engineering depar**ent came to fix it after calling twice. After the engineering depar**ent came, we told him that we were going out to eat and watch the sea. Then we came back and the air conditioner was not repaired, and no one was there. , where is the tool still placed. We had already set Do Not Disturb the night before, and the cleaning lady knocked on the door the next day. Is it just a decoration?
The hotel has an airport pick-up service, but if the hotel is booked by a third party, it cannot provide the airport drop-off service. You can only contact the third party yourself. This is the first time I have encountered this.
My evaluation of this hotel is first-class scenery, second-rate facilities, and third-rate service.

msg:The location of the hotel is in Sanya Bay, close to Phoenix Airport, it is more convenient to go to Nanshan, and it is also relatively close to the sea. Not far away is a Muslim cemetery by the sea. I booked a cheaper room type. The hotel is estimated to be 18 years old. The room is a bit old, the air conditioner is relatively loud, blowing directly on the bed, and the overhead fan is okay, but the elderly can't stand the direct blowing. Disposable slippers, etc. are not provided, and you need to ask the service staff for additional ones. It's not very convenient to eat around, there are relatively few. The double room with garden view is relatively stuffy, which probably has something to do with the air in Sanya, but the room is okay, not very big. When booking, I hoped to arrange it in a quieter place away from the elevator entrance, but it happened to be right at the elevator entrance. . . Due to the schedule during the day, I didn't have time to change rooms. In short, this experience was not very comfortable. The hotel's drop-off driver is still very awesome! Since we got up early, the hotel also packed a simple breakfast! The free drink is too cold, and the elderly can't drink it when they are thirsty. . Hope you can put some normal temperature pure water.

I originally booked a parent-child room with one bedroom and one living room, but the brother at the front desk upgraded it to two bedrooms and one living room for free. Hall, this is a super surprise. Children like to play in the water. I was worried that the swimming pool was too deep. I consulted the staff. The water depth is 1.15. Children are not afraid at all. The swimming pool can go to the road through two small paths on the left and right. The seafood restaurant is on the left, and the beach is just across the road. It is very convenient to play with sand. The hotel facilities are fairly complete and clean, and the types of breakfast are good. I was planning to eat seafood from dolphins, but it rained just as I was about to go out. I can only eat in the restaurant of the hotel. Surprisingly, the seafood set meal for dinner is better than outside It's affordable and the taste is okay. The 318 set meal is more than enough for two big ones and one small one. Anyway, the overall experience is pretty good. The frontal sea view is invincible. You can see the entire coastline of Sanya Bay. I will definitely stay here again next time.

You can see the sea from the balcony. It really takes four or five minutes to get to the beach and the seaside after leaving the hotel. It’s nice to take pictures. We also rented the hotel’s swimming ring and went to the sea for a while. At noon, the hotel restaurant helped us heat up the dishes we had packed before, and provided us with a table to sit on. There are a lot of food across the road from the main entrance of the hotel, the price is moderate and the taste is good. In the end, it was very fast to take a taxi to the airport, and it only cost a dozen yuan and arrived in 20 minutes. The whole experience is very happy, it can be said that it has drawn a perfect end to this trip to Sanya.

My child was stung miserably, with lumps everywhere from head to toe. When I got up to have breakfast the next day, I found that the child had various red acne marks on his face. Let’s talk about the hotel floors. The line of sight below the 4th floor is completely blocked, and you can’t see the sea. It’s best to choose a room with a balcony. It’s not an exaggeration for a child to change 4 sets of clothes in one day. With a balcony, you can dry clothes quickly. Let's talk about breakfast, the variety is quite rich, but the taste is really average and needs to be improved. Let’s talk about the distance from the sea. It’s a bit strange to go through a hotel to get to the seaside street from the hotel’s swimming pool, but it’s really close by walking. It’s only 3 minutes away. If you go from the hotel’s main entrance to the seaside, it’s like walking around the hotel. It takes only 8 minutes to walk around a 180-degree periphery. The hotel is 30 minutes by taxi from the center of Sanya District (without congestion). If you are in Sanya, if you don’t go out of Sanya District, it is recommended to rent a battery car to play. The ultraviolet rays are super strong, so you must bring various sunscreens!

The buffet breakfast is not very tasty. The temperature of the bath water has been changing every ten seconds, switching between very cool, normal, and very hot. The same is true when changing rooms. The bath that can be finished in ten minutes originally needs to be used. It took half an hour to finish washing cursingly.

msg:The overall hardware is quite old. 1, The room was upgraded for free, great. 2. The security guards can't afford the railings when they go out. It is inconvenient and inelegant to use the railings to enter and leave the hotel every day. 3. I pressed Do Not Disturb at 10:30, but the waiter kept knocking on the door twice. Respect the guests and rest, okay? 4. The hygiene of the buffet is poor. The last batch of people in the hotel is over. Immediately clean up and put on the table mat for the next person to eat. There is no sanitation here. When the table mat is spread, see the guests and quickly put it away, because the second, third, and fourth are needed. The second time I feel troublesome and waste table mats and increase the workload. Anyway, I just eat five-star old-fashioned business without worrying about the source of tourists during the peak season. For five-star tourists who live in five-star hotels, especially those who live in Sanya, one visit is enough. However, those who have no requirements for travel and do not go out several times throughout the year, and those who only want to have a place to live can indeed meet their needs.

msg:I lived in a 180 sea view room, the sea view is really good, and the hotel's swimming pool is downstairs. It's just because the lobby and aisles are open, and it's hotter without air conditioning. There are not many varieties of breakfast but it can be full, after all, the price is cheap. Very close to the beach from the hotel. What I want to complain about is the hot water. The water released is constantly switching between extremely hot and extremely cold. You must seize the only few seconds during the switching to take a bath at the appropriate water temperature, which wastes a lot of time and increases irritability. The air conditioner in one of the suites is extremely weak, so we can only open the door to use the air conditioner in other rooms.

The downstairs swimming pool has always been there Adults and children are playing in the water, because there are not many people in the swimming pool now in the off-season, and the hotel also provides airport transfers and free travel photography (because I didn't take pictures in a hurry). I played the hotel until the early morning. I don’t know if it was too late. The temperature of the bath water was unstable, but the heat in Sanya had little effect. Of course, it would be better if it was improved. Compare the price of Meituan Fliggy before booking. Ctrip is the best price. You can go to the central hospital for about 7 kilometers for nucleic acid testing. In general, the experience is very good and worth recommending to everyone! !

I don't know how to design the bathing place in the hotel, there is no waterproof platform or something. Once you take a shower, all the bathrooms are filled with water, which can flow out of the door after a long time of washing. There are elderly people and children.

The hotel environment is quiet and comfortable, the swimming pool is also large, the photos are particularly beautiful, and it is very close to the sea. A good place to watch the sunrise and sunset, I was a little reluctant to leave when I walked. It is also convenient to eat around and travel. There will be opportunities to stay in the future. My evaluations are all because their service touched me, not for any personal gain.

msg:I wonder why the hotel can be rated as five stars. Ctrip's evaluation scores have always been of great reference value, but this company's 4.6 is really not flattering.
When checking in, apart from giving a room card, I didn't say anything. The swimming pool was closed for maintenance when we went. That's fine, after all, it's a matter of luck. However, there was a water leak in the bathing place, and it spread to the entire toilet. It was really unbearable... When I checked in, other guests complained that the bath water was hot and cold, which shows that this hotel has a lot of toilet problems. Even a three-star hotel shouldn't have this problem...
There is also no air-conditioning in the hotel breakfast and it is very speechless... The hotel lobby in Sanya does not have air-conditioning, but the place where the breakfast is not open-air-conditioned and I am also drunk. The variety of breakfast is at the level of Home Inn.
The advantage of this hotel is the pick-up service, the driver Xiao Yang is pretty good. Also the hotel is very close to the beach. The house price of more than 300 in peak season is also really cheap, so it can't be required by five stars.

msg:Shanghai is too cold in winter, so I brought my baby and my wife to Sanya to soak in the sun and bubble water. I had planned to find a family for a few days between Sanya Bay and Dadonghai. Later, I saw that this hotel is very close to the Muslim cemetery, so I chose this one. After all, it is not common for barbecue stalls and square dances to choose this kind of place... (manually funny) The hotel is basically a resort, and the hardware can't be said. Well, after all, it is old and not suitable for trendy men, trendy women and young couples who are in love with adultery. However, if it is mainly for families, it is still very good. The price/performance ratio is really high and the sea view of the balcony room is also great. The swimming pool water in the hotel is also ok, at least much better than most of the open-air swimming pools in Shanghai in summer, and there is basically no disinfectant water. Strange smell, the store is close to the beach in the west section of Sanya Bay, and it is very convenient to shop, eat, and hang out in Lihe MOHO. In the few days I stayed in Sanya, the general feeling was that the front desk of the hotel responded in a timely manner, and the cleaning staff had a good attitude, but the bedding and bathroom products in the hotel were a bit speechless, and the bath water should be at least empty from cold to hot. It takes more than 5 minutes to reach a relatively warm level and the water output is extremely small. The buffet breakfast provided by the hotel is relatively small. Is it delicious... Forget it, skip it, anyway, it is only 28 meals, what else can you ask for? , it is not a problem to eat enough. On the first day, I was too lazy to go out at the hotel, so I simply ate a so-called children's set meal at the restaurant on the first floor. The price of 218 was a lot, the taste was okay, and the price was very high. Finally, since the suite rooms are provided with refrigerators, is it better to add a washing machine.

msg:The hotel is great. Although it is a veteran hotel, the internal facilities are not old at all. The key thing is that the hotel offers a free upgrade to the high-rise sea view room. It’s great. It overlooks the entire Sanya Bay panoramic view. It’s so shocking. Come to Sanya, I will stay here next time, and I will recommend it to my friends, thanks to the leader on duty at the front desk of the hotel

msg:Generally speaking, I would like to thank the little brother at the front desk and the young lady from the reservation depar**ent for helping me change rooms during the National Day. But what I want to complain about is the restaurant. In the morning, I went to eat at the door of the house inspection card. The woman had a face like she owed her money. The waiter in the restaurant, two younger men and women, flirted with each other. The car that collects food scraps is disgusting. The two men and women have been chatting very loudly. The woman said I bought fruit for you to eat. Why is it so speechless. The waiter who went to dinner the first morning was even more funny, no I got the paper towels, and I asked the waiter. It was about three to five meters away. The waiter said directly that I have it here, and then just stood still. It’s not that I have to put on the airs of a guest. You don’t even have the most basic courtesy. Hey, there is also the staff in the restaurant. He wanted to pick up fried rice noodles, but he took the pot and left. He said that the heating underneath the pot was broken. As a result, it was not repaired, so he put it back in the original place. Just watching me waiting there with a plate, I can understand that the National Day people are busy, the most basic professionalism is gone, and there is no training. The restaurant service staff is really discounted.

There are also many places to eat near the hotel, and Wyndham next door is very convenient. But the disadvantage is that the air conditioner is not very powerful. I don't know if it is the cause of the top floor. The other is that the water pressure in the bath is very strong, but the warm water is unstable and hot and cold. But the hotel with this view is really cost-effective.

msg:traffic location:
It has a great location, just across the road from the sea, and the beautiful sea view when you open the curtains. You can see the entire Sanya Bay when you live in a high-rise building. The hotel is not far from Sanya Airport and it takes 10 minutes by taxi.

Room view:
The little brother at the front desk upgraded us to a 180-degree two-bedroom ocean view room, and we can take a beautiful ocean view from the room. Sitting on the balcony in the evening to watch the sunset is particularly pleasant. This room type is quite suitable for family travel and friends travel.

Cost performance:
I stayed in two hotels in Sanya on National Day, and the other was an infinity pool internet celebrity hotel in Dadonghai, but the price/performance ratio was not as high as that of Hai Cube. After staying at Sea Cube, I decided to stay here in Sanya again next time. Not expensive per person, and the sea view is particularly beautiful. If you want the kind of private beach feel, choose this hotel!

Health and services:
Exceeding expectations, the hotel staff are responsive and have a good staying experience.

It just happened that the room was cleaned and the door was not closed, so we moved in. As a result, the room was messed up, and it also affected the check-in of people behind. But the staff was very patient and took us to the 16th floor.
The room facilities are very standard and the scenery is very good.
My favorite is the swimming pool. I go swimming at night. The depth is very suitable for small people. The water temperature is also very suitable. It is very suitable for learning to swim.
Also near the sea

There are many seafood stalls nearby, but it is definitely not recommended to eat the barbecue in the store. The lamb is fake and the barbecue taste is not authentic.

msg:I stayed in Sanya for six days and stayed in two B&Bs and two hotels. The Ocean Cube Hotel is our most satisfied and cost-effective hotel. The breakfast is very rich and the rice noodles are very delicious. I ate three bowls, and the kids liked it. Chicken rice flower, French fries, mango juice, omelette. Because I live in a family suite, the area is large enough and I can see the sea directly. It is very beautiful. I especially like her swimming pool. The water is clean and the area is large. There are few people for swimming in the afternoon. From the small gate of the swimming pool, there is a restaurant to the beach. It is very close and there are few people on the beach. At seven o'clock in the evening, when the sun was going down, our family of three rented two battery cars and rode on the road along the Yemeng Promenade, chasing the sunset. It was really beautiful. When I went to Sanya this time, I didn't encounter anyone who was cheated on the Internet. The locals and waiters in the restaurant were all real and there were no arbitrary charges. I was very impressed. On the left side of the hotel after the crossroads, there is a small pepper Sichuan restaurant, which is really delicious. We ate three meals in a row and it was very delicious. Whether it is boiled pork slices or coconut chicken, they are very authentic. Recommended.
🚗 Transportation:
🚗 Transportation: The transportation is very convenient. When I went, I drove to the hotel by car. When I left, I was very close to the airport. I arrived in more than ten minutes. Toll.

Of course, if you want to go on your own time, it is also very convenient to have a bus stop. Nothing was done for breakfast, but the freshly fried fries every day were delicious. Finally, the air conditioner needs to be overhauled regularly. If it is turned on continuously, there will be water leakage.

msg:作為三亞最後一站，特意選了一個離機場近，離海灘近，離景點近的酒店住兩晚，先説優點，酒店位置可以，門口不遠處有去南山寺和天涯海涯的公交車，景點回來休息後，從後門過馬路就到海邊，晚上也可以泡在泳池裡。在説缺點，前台誇拉着臉，感覺像是誰欠他錢是的，窗台上的墊子有污漬，早餐可能是外包吧，管理刻板，我家孩子剛好一米二讓補票，我説天域，珊瑚都沒讓補票啊，他竟然讓站那量身高，穿鞋1.22也不行就得補，補了48，關鍵味道也不怎麼的，這也是本次三亞之行中唯一讓孩子補早餐的酒店，對比珊瑚天域大東海報房號直接讓進的心裏確實有點不舒服。酒店還免費提供接送機，送機最早是早上五點半，我們是六點五十的飛機，怕趕不上沒坐。
雖然因為早餐事件有點不愉快，但對於房間細節不太在意的，還是比較推薦的

3，我們10點到的10點多小哥領着看完房，12點20才收拾完，不敢恭維。

msg:三亞灣鳳凰島高端潛水遊:就是個坑，千萬別下這種捆綁的潛水，這是妥妥的把羊騙進來宰，到了潛水的地方之後要你高消費，不買貴的套餐就故意讓海水浸濕你的眼睛，痛的不行。如果你沒有升級他們更貴的套餐，還沒有開始潛水就想辦法逼你自己回去，太噁心了這個。
服務：服務真的很一般。問前台能否做個房型升級，前台不肯，後來付了費才給升了房，其實就是自己花原價住了更高一點的樓層，下次不會考慮這家酒店了。
環境：唯一的優點就是離海近，離機場近。其他沒有什麼值得入住的。

msg:非常差勁的一次入住體驗，第一次給酒店差評，因為實在太掃興了：
1、接送機必須要提前一天預約，沒標明凸顯，晚上的飛機，因為前一天晚上打過去下班了，入住當天早上打電話預約接機不可以，必須要提前一天，然後打酒店直接説這邊建議您自己打車。這種情況不應該標清楚了必須要提前24小時預約嗎？而且酒店態度就是很差。
2、預訂的10月1號住店，送的服務包含天涯書局的飲品兑換券，到前台領了一張。結果興沖沖跑過去，説是已經過期了，一看酒店給的兑換券，顯示9月30號到期。打電話問酒店，説我預訂的時候是有的，10月1入住就沒有了，這種情況要麼產品裏別贈送，要麼就説清楚已經過期了，或者換其他替代品，酒店還是擺爛。
最後，還是要給攜程點贊，客服非常認真負責的解決問題，幫忙協調想辦法。對比之下這酒店太不專業了，完全不會做服務。

msg:首先要説明，以下觀點僅代表我個人感受。這次酒店是我三亞之行入住四個酒店中，最差的沒有之一。分3點説，僅供要來的小夥伴參考。一、就是人員服務，除了收錢的時候有點笑容，全程板著臉。入住之後發現卧室的空調不是很好用，打電話到前台被告知已經升級了房間，無法調整。下樓找到前台，之前接待的服務人員反應很讓人很不爽。換了個人也是不疼不癢的説安排人去房間看看。就這樣還收了住房按金，最主要的是電視遙控器都沒有蓋子，還有就是涼台的門居然是開着一條縫的，建議住的時候檢查一下。二、攜程上選了很久，贈飲這種東西吧，要不就不要寫，寫了就認真對待。弄了個勾兑飲料機放在一邊，什麼都不寫。問了才告訴。最搞笑的是杯子，沒有消毒櫃裸露在外面，一言難盡。三是早餐的餐廳居然沒有空調，全是風扇。早餐吃到汗流浹背，到處是沒有收拾的桌子，筷子也沒有消毒櫃，早餐打出來的牛奶居然衹有水。最後想説的是有的酒店是住了之後，下次還想再去。有的酒店真的是第一次也是最後一次。

msg:無法用語言來形容我對海立方酒店的不滿。由於我個人失誤，入住時把身份證落在了前台。臨回家前一晚發現身份證找不到了，就去前台問，前台員工在兩個抽屜裏找出來最少七八張身份證，告知沒有我的。我仔細回想除了入住時用過身份證，就再也沒拿出來過。所以第二天不甘心，吃完早飯又去前台問，報上我的姓名後前台一個女員工立馬説有，然後就給我了。本來我還會感激下前台，但是找到身份證是因為我自己不甘心，第二次去前台問才找到的，所以我非常氣氛。我問前台經理“入住時跟我要了電話號碼，前台工作人員發現我的身份證遺落在前台為什麼沒人告知我？還有我發現身份證找不到了去前台問為什麼告訴我沒有呢？”給我的回覆是他們這兒客人遺落的證件都是放在前台，等着客人自己來找……三亞海立方度假酒店，你們就是收着一晚將近800元的房費，然後服務水準如此之差唄？㊗️你們“生意興隆”啊。這輩子也不會再住這家破酒店了！！！

衞生：一般，睡了一夜兩條小腿咬了60多個包，泳池也比較小，也沒看到清空泳池防水的，所以沒有敢帶娃下水。
服務：唯一我覺得很不錯的就是賦予了，這個價格居然有禮賓員，非常有禮貌，主動幫拿行李。中間有問題聯繫前台，也很快解決。服務態度真的不錯。這是我對這個酒店唯一印象好的地方。特別想吐槽他的早餐，太難吃了，69一位哎奉勸各位直接叫外賣吧。
總的來説，雖然價格便宜，但是一分錢一分貨，除了服務好，服務態度尚可其他沒有任何。不會再入住了。同樣價格不如選擇乾淨整潔裝修好的民宿來的舒服。

msg:離海邊很近，因為是一家人出遊，訂的套房帶早餐，有接機，房價在11樓，真180度海景，可以看到鳳凰島和西島，但房間設施整體還是有點陳舊，尤其是地板因為顏色的原因，看就來就像是沒有做地面清潔一樣。但想想這幾天的價格，稍微平衡一點。總的房間面積沒有介紹的122平那麼大，但有個挺大的陽台，坐在陽台看海超級棒，但這幾天可能天氣的原因，沒看到日落，有點遺憾。餐廳早餐品種還算豐富，味道中規中距。不過服務態度確實挺好。尤其是行李房的一個小哥。總體來説，入住體驗還算滿意。本人不喜拍照，沒什麼照片。

酒店的內部設施還有裝修不錯，性價比很高，同時最滿意的一點是離海灘很近，而且是環境不錯的那種海灘，我想這是來海南的最大意義，八樓的海景房雖然沒法看到完整的日出，但是每天早上醒來第一眼就是大海，視野很廣，符合海景房的名頭
最後就是，如果想吃酒店早餐，建議攜程上直接買，單買要69/人，雖然是自助餐，不過感覺還是略貴了

3、要去沙灘，酒店與沙灘間有一輪的墳墓，怕怕，一點都沒有"棷夢長廊"的感覺。
4、服務員的態度是挺好的
