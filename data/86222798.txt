msg:One of the best China hotel, impressed me from check in moments. Took me less than 10mins for check in process, the room is clean and bigger than expected. Recommend to book the room with breakfast, it has variety of choice, noodles, porridge, breads, eggs, cake, fruits, desserts and others. The hotel offer 1 time free of tea break session and supper is free daily. Credit went to ms. Daisy, helped us to sorty out the tickets for giant panda base, it require local contact to complete the ticket purchase, and the buggy ride tickets too via WeChat. It is a must to add them in WeChat for whatever reason to seek for help. China may not be a tourist friendly place but with the help of good hotel services, it did reduce most of the seen challenges. Hotel Pagoda will be my hotel choice when I visit to chengdu again, hopefully soon within this year

Easy to get around, Room starts from 31st floor which is alot higher than usual hotel room that means you get the perfect view and weather. The small gesture that is provided by the hotel, including washing machine and dryer is a add on for us as we travel there quite a few days and much needed that. Around the area always have food even late hours and the push cart is always round the corner. Highly recommended. üëç

I particularly appreciated the free first found of the minibar which I used, and my package included some high tea and supper, which I chose not to use because I wanted to eat in the city.

Beautiful design, great stay, fuss-free check in and check out. What'@ not to like?

Special mention to Nancy Shine Coco.

The front desk saw that we were with our children and thoughtfully helped us upgrade to a landmark building where we could see the escaped panda. Because the child had a fever the night before, he took a late nap in the hotel the next day, and the front desk also helped us delay it. It really felt very heartwarming.

But I will probably stay at Pagoda next time because the location is so good! 3 minutes walk from Chunxi Road ifs. There are restaurants downstairs, which is really convenient. The room facilities are very new and all are intelligently controlled. Very modern and convenient. Breakfast is also one of the highlights. In addition to the traditional Chinese and Western buffet, there are also hot and sour noodles with tofu dip, etc., which is great! When I finally checked out, I gave the children a panda doll to take home. It was a very satisfying stay experience and I will recommend it to my relatives and friends.

The lighting in the room is also great and bright. The guest room is a high-rise guest room. The room has a small red refrigerator and the things are also free to use when you check in. It is very considerate. There are also 2 facial masks in the room, which can be used to replenish the water for the little face that is accidentally sunburned. Hahahaha, this is also very considerate. I really feel the attentiveness of this hotel everywhere. The design of the hotel is also very good. The front desk is an open front desk. This is also very novel. There is a self-service laundry room and gym on the 31st floor of the hotel, which can be used for free. Thanks to coco and daisy

The room was very clean, the bathroom facilities were complete, the bed was very comfortable and soft, the high-altitude city view was also great, and the smart Xiaojun was also very cute. Although she was very cold and only liked a few songs, when I said goodbye to her, she sang a song about goodbye for me. Special thanks to shine, yuki, and tom. I ordered takeout every night, and they helped me deal with it and let the robot deliver it to the door. It was very thoughtful. If there was any need, they would reply to WeChat in seconds, which was very dedicated. When we left the hotel, they also gave us a panda doll, which was very considerate! I stayed for three days and it was very comfortable. Next time I come to Chengdu, I will give priority to Pagoda.

The facilities and layout of the room are excellent, the separate toilet is large and the layout is also reasonable. A mobile desk and a sofa in the room can be used as a dining table or an office desk. The balcony also provides an extra surprise.
The catering is also excellent, with rich breakfasts and extra free supper every night. The restaurant is very design-oriented and the scenery is also very good. You can directly see the giant pandas climbing the wall of IFS.
Free laundry room and room service are also very convenient.
Thanks to Tom, Yuki, and Shine at the front desk for answering various questions and providing help in a timely manner.
A small suggestion to further improve the hotel, the laundry room dryer can be upgraded to a more powerful one. The hotel has a high occupancy rate and many people use it, so the waiting time for the dryer is a little longer. In addition, consider adding a small slope from the hotel entrance to the road to facilitate pushing the suitcase up when checking in. However, it does not affect the overall 5-star praise!

Facilities: The hotel facilities are relatively new and modern, which is in line with the aesthetics of young people and has a sense of design.
Hygiene: It is cleaned very well. Every day when I come back, the floor is clean and the bathroom is dry.
Environment: It is very close to Chunxi Road and Taikoo Li. It takes about 5-10 minutes to walk there, so there is no need to worry about eating, drinking, shopping and watching the excitement around. We stayed in the Chunxi Road view room and could see the 3D panda every day (the staff said: the naked eye 3D is the one in Taikoo Li), but I still saw the 3D effect.
Service: Their service focuses on being responsive. The attitude is very good. The details are also very considerate. The breakfast is delicious. A bowl of wontons is necessary every day, and there are also dandan noodles. Other Western dishes are also delicious, and they also have blue cheese, which really gave me a surprise.
Thanks to the staff tom alan daisy dan shine for their good and considerate service.

The hotel is in a very convenient location, and the design style is comfortable and unique. It has its own personality in the unique style of Chengdu. It is really great! I feel the efforts made by the designer to enhance the experience of guests. The hotel is close to Taikoo Li Commercial Street and Sichuan Opera Museum. It is fashionable and cultural. There are large restaurants suitable for business banquets, as well as roadside stalls and snack streets frequented by ordinary people every day. It is quiet in the bustling city, and it is up to people to choose simplicity. This may be the character of Chengdu: introverted, practical, and down-to-earth. I will stay at Junting Hotel again!

The hotel is positioned as a boutique hotel. It should not be a luxury hotel, but it is priced like a luxury hotel during the May Day holiday. There is no coffee machine but drip coffee. The hardware facilities in the room are good, the bed is very comfortable, the lighting is appropriate, and the air conditioner is a little loud. The bed is very large, and the twin bed room is more than 1.4 meters, which is very suitable for children.

Problems: 1. In the late breakfast, the meal is not enough. In addition, the waiter will not take the initiative to ask for coffee, etc. The tableware is self-service, which seems to be more mid-range.
2. The entrance and corridor service staff did not take the initiative to greet.
3. Toothbrush, hair loss.

Service: The reception staff are quite enthusiastic, and the room has been upgraded, which is still very grateful. But there are still some shortcomings. I had afternoon tea twice, and the loquats were rotten once, which made me feel strange. Why didn't I choose them well before putting them out? Another time, I took a cup to pour tea and drank it, but the cup was full of hair and dust. I felt that this low-level problem was not right. In addition, there were many people at breakfast, and the staff only wiped the table. The ground was full of rice grains and was not cleaned, which was very uncomfortable to step on. I feel that details still need to be paid attention to.
When checking out, a panda doll was also given, which was also a small surprise

I was afraid of losing things and avoiding unnecessary trouble, so please work The staff offered me a glass of Americano, but the staff refused me and told me that I had to swipe my card to get an Americano. Then I would like to ask why I need to swipe my card twice when the coffee machine is in the restaurant and I entered the restaurant with my card. I told her angrily that because she was afraid of losing something, she rejected me for the second time, and then walked to the edge and stood chatting with another staff member. I'm really speechless.
To sum up, if this is a three-star hotel, I can accept it, but the corresponding one is a five-star hotel, which I think is quite ridiculous.

msg:A very satisfying and happy hotel experience. Breakfast and afternoon tea are very good, with many varieties. You can see climbing pandas in the parent-child room. The two kids lie there to watch the pandas every night when they come back. There is also a giant panda doll in the room, and the kids are so happy. When checking out, the front desk saw that we had two kids, so they gave us an extra giant panda, which effectively avoided the problem of the two kids fighting! I would like to especially praise the little brother who was on duty on the first floor at noon on the 12th. He had a super good attitude. When I went to pick up the stored luggage, I forgot to take the rabbit head I bought. The little brother chased us and gave it back. Later, I forgot to ask the little brother what his name was. The hotel should praise him!

1. Good location: Walk to the left of the main entrance, about 500 meters to IFS, Taikoo Li, Parkson and other areas; walk to the right of the main entrance, about 400 meters to Chunxi Road, Wangfujing and other areas. In short, the core location of the commercial district is easily accessible;
2. Convenient transportation: Walk to the left of the main entrance, about 400 meters to the Second Municipal Hospital subway station, Line 3, Line 4 gathering place, it is convenient to go anywhere. The IFS Giant Panda Area, 500 meters from the main entrance mentioned in the previous article, has a direct bus to Sanxingdui and the Panda Base, which is very convenient to get to.
3. Hotel facilities: There are free fitness equipment, washing machines, and steam irons, which can be used at any time, and you don't have to bring your own portable ironing machine
4. Hotel services: There are free afternoon tea and free supper. The afternoon tea environment is beautiful and quiet. After traveling, you can drink coffee and tea, eat snacks, and fight again!
5. Hotel surprises: There are many free drinks in the refrigerator, and there are also facial masks to use, which is very friendly to girls! There are also drip coffees that you like! There are also small gifts for check-out!

There are many more... In short, it is worth the money!

The breakfast is a little inferior compared to Regent and Intercontinental, but the service offsets this shortcoming.

The only drawback is that only the Four Seasons rooms have bathtubs. I think it would be trivial to arrange a bathtub in such a large space for the Chunxi Road View Room, but

In terms of geographical location, I feel that it is not necessary to live near Chunxi Road when traveling to Chengdu. There is nothing interesting in Chunxi Road and Taikoo Li.
There was also an incident. Halfway through the shower, the ceiling wall of the shower room fell off. I was shocked, but luckily it didn't hit me. I reported it to the hotel and sent a maintenance man to check it out, but there was no response. . We are not being pretentious, but this is definitely not the attitude and service level that a five-star hotel should have. .
Overall, I was completely misled by the five-star rating and the luxury list when I booked this hotel. . If you are looking for a luxury hotel, this hotel will definitely not work. If you are looking for location and cost-effectiveness, it can only be said to be okay, not particularly outstanding.

In addition, there is a corner in the corridor where different brands of styling spray, shaving cream and other daily necessities are specially placed. The details are very good. Like it.

Hygiene: The elevator requires a card to enter the corresponding floor, so the environment is very quiet and clean.

Facilities: The self-service laundry room is very convenient. There are three washing machines and three dryers. The gym is also in the laundry room. It has not been used yet. It should be good by visual inspection. The hotel's takeaways are delivered directly to the lobby on the 30th floor, so there is no need to go down. On the first floor, the hotel has a takeaway robot. You can probably call or WeChat the front desk to have the robot deliver it to your room. I haven't tried it, so I'm guessing.

Service: The service attitude of the staff is very good. They always smile and say hello when meeting. They also gave the children a red panda doll when they checked out, which is very nice! Special cue to the three staff members Shine, Leo and Tom!

Location: The location is special. I personally think it suits me better. It takes about 3-5 minutes to walk to IFS. It is a quiet place in the middle of the bustle. Especially if you come to Chengdu during the holidays, you will not want to see the dense crowds at various attractions. Great. The hotel is located between Chunxi Road Subway Station and Second City Hospital Subway Station, both within a 5-minute walk.

The room is spacious. We brought two large suitcases, two small suitcases, and three backpacks and placed them between the bed and the TV wall. The horizontal sofa and movable coffee table in front of the window are very suitable for lying there and enjoying the night view of the IFS generation. There is also a horizontal sofa chair at the foot of each bed, which is great for putting things, changing shoes, or just sitting there.

The hotel has a good location and is convenient for eating, drinking and shopping. Because it's in the city center, it's not far to go anywhere (in the city).
The hotel will only open in 2022, and the facilities are also new.

Good service attitude and fast speed. I asked for two extra pillows in the middle of the night and they were delivered shortly.

Free breakfast and late night snacks. The afternoon tea provided was also good. There are many varieties for breakfast, and the late-night porridge (several kinds to choose from) makes your stomach feel good. One time I ate too late at noon, so I had a late night snack when I lost my appetite.

The disadvantage is that when I used the smart toilet for the first time, I spent a while thinking about it before finding the flush button among a bunch of buttons. It is recommended to post a note next to it.

I forgot to take photos of the interior of the room, only one photo each of afternoon tea and supper.

50 yuan voucher for Gushi Xiangjiao Beef Intangible Cultural Heritage Snack Banquet Restaurant: This restaurant is so delicious! ! ! must go! The hotel is about 10 minutes' walk away, very convenient!

Late night snack for two people: This late night snack is actually very ordinary, just some porridge and buns, it feels like breakfast.

Buffet afternoon tea for two people: A big pot of tea with some small points is good, but if you add one more person, it will cost 98 yuan per person, which seems a bit expensive.

You can see the giant panda of IFS directly from the hotel window, and then the room is full of smart appliances, which is very convenient. The service staff were also very polite and professional. They even gave me a panda doll as a gift before leaving. I liked it very much! I will choose Junting next time!

The aunt is gentle and polite, and the breakfast has many varieties, which is fresh and delicious. However, it seems that the car cannot enter the door. You have to cross the road with your luggage and enter the door. This is not good, but the doorman will help you immediately when he sees it.

msg:The experience is very average. Although it is a five-star hotel rated by Ctrip, the standard of Ctrip's self-rated hotel is also very high!
First of all, let‚Äôs talk about the location. It‚Äôs in an untidy alley, next to a theater; secondly, the room, the walls are not clean and there are obvious stains; and then the bathroom, there are no slippers or anti-slip mats for bathing. I called the front desk and was told that I had to wash my feet barefoot or wear disposable slippers. However, there is only one pair of slippers for each person in the room. If you wear slippers for washing, there will be no clean slippers to change after you come out. You have to call the front desk to ask before the service staff will bring them. Why not prepare more slippers in the room from the beginning? Where are the two pairs of slippers? Now let‚Äôs talk about takeout. I have a total of three small food takeout orders. The takeaway guy put them all in the front hall on the 30th floor and sent a message to the front desk staff to ask the robot to deliver them. The staff called me and told me that the robot can only load one package at a time. Bag, this would be troublesome and slow, so I said it would be best to go to the front hall to pick it up yourself. I feel like I don‚Äôt want robots to deliver them. Finally, let‚Äôs talk about the pillows. A five-star hotel will have such pillows. One was extremely soft and the other was extremely hard. They were actually made of space cotton pillows, which could not support my neck and head at all. I couldn‚Äôt sleep well all night. In addition, let‚Äôs talk about the elevator. It runs unstable up and down, and there is a particularly obvious tinnitus sound.

2. Since we were initially placed on the 38th floor, the altitude was a bit high, so the housekeeper patiently moved us to a lower floor.
3. Breakfast, afternoon tea, and supper are all very good. If you have an early trip, the hotel can arrange an early departure, which is really considerate. The place where you have breakfast is opposite the giant panda climbing the wall of the International Financial Center.
4. The window of the deluxe twin room faces the TV tower.
5. From Shuangliu Airport to the hotel, take Line 10 from Taipingyuan Station to Line 3 at the Second Municipal Hospital Station. If you are carrying luggage, you must take the entrance with the elevator. A. Having only stairs is too tiring.
6. All the facilities in the house can be controlled by voice, giving it a high-end feel.
You will get at least six drinks from the minibar when you check in, and you will get a panda doll when you check out.

msg:It‚Äôs really hard to rate this one‚Ä¶
Since I only stayed in Chengdu for one night, I found a cheaper [five-star] hotel on Chunxi Road.
I was really shocked when I arrived. It was so shabby... Even the check-in area was so shabby... I was even more shocked when I entered the room, it was like a chain hotel. I really can't figure out how you got this five-star?
Although the bathing area is separated from wet and dry, but! The bathroom stall was not even sealed, and all the water leaked into the adjacent bathroom. The bathroom door couldn't be closed completely, and the water was all over the place after taking a shower, which looked terrible (I didn't take any photos because it looked so dirty)
The next day when I checked out, the front desk asked me to write a positive review for them, and even took the initiative to write the names of three staff members for me, meaning that I could mention their names in the review. I? ? ? First of all, there is no service (that is, the guy at the hotel entrance on the first floor helped push the luggage, thank you). Secondly, I have reported the problem of bathroom leakage, and they asked me again and again to write a good reviewüòÖ It makes me feel good about the experience. Extremely bad! After I flew to Shanghai in the evening, the hotel called me again but I didn't answer (I doubt it was to remind me to write a positive review), which was really off-putting. If you want to create KPIs, you must at least provide services instead of kidnapping guests morally.
The first time I wrote a negative review, I donated it to this hotel!
Don't contact me to ask me to delete your comments, I will block you directly!

The location is very good, it's quiet in the middle of the bustle. Just a few minutes' walk away is Taikoo Li and Ifs. The rooms are all on the 30th floor and have great views, and the night view is even brighter. The balcony is the highlight, the air is very smooth, there are sofas and a small bar on the balcony where you can drink tea and coffee, and smokers will not be disturbed! The hotel is very grand, with discounts on Ctrip packages, complimentary afternoon tea and supper, complimentary drinks from the minibar are also very trendy, and there is even a facial mask. The waiters are all polite, young and energetic. Special thanks to Shine, Aim, Jay and Alan for their warm care. I was very satisfied after staying here for two days. My children couldn't bear to leave Xiaojun. They will come back to stay in Chengdu in the future.

Lynn, Nancy, and Leo at the front desk are skilled in business and have a very good service attitude. When I asked for a quiet room, I got a very satisfactory result. We stayed for 6 days and slept peacefully in a quiet environment every day. The room is well-equipped, comfortable and clean, has a balcony, and has a good view from the upper floors. Breakfast is rich. Some projects in the hotel are very user-friendly. For example, free late night snacks, free refrigerator drinks and moisturizing facial masks (so that we non-locals who are not used to spicy meals can supplement the light diet). The hotel also has some features worthy of praise, such as the charging sockets on the bedside table in the room, the night lights in the bathroom, etc., which are all designed to be very user-friendly.

Because after checking in at the Chengdu hotel in the morning, I rushed to Dujiangyan and Panda Valley, missing the afternoon tea time. The late night snacks and breakfast are rich in food, which is also very suitable for Chaoshan people who are not good at spicy food. The only drawback is that there are few sockets in the room and it is not convenient to boil the kettle. The most important thing is that I was given a baby panda as a gift when I checked out, which was really an unexpected surprise. I will go there next time and get together as a coupleüêºüêª‚ùÑÔ∏è

For example, there is no big mirror, the kettle is too small, and the boiled water is only enough for one person to drink. There is no anti-slip mat or hook in the bathroom. There is no place to hang the towel when taking a bath, and there is no place to put the shampoo. Water, etc.; the front desk is on the 30th floor, and there is no doorman on the first floor, so we can't pick up our luggage; parking is not allowed in front of the hotel, but no one informed us, so we could only unload our luggage on the messy street, and the bellman also took his time to pick up our luggage. ; The service attitude is also very poor. The luggage was not brought to the room for 10 minutes. The waiter did not smile the whole time and was not enthusiastic at all. Are you pretending to be cool? Or is it to match the cold style of the hotel? The only thing that makes people satisfied is that the breakfast is okay

msg:I rarely write reviews. I have traveled to many cities and countries and this is the first time I encountered a so-called "five-star hotel". When the cleaning lady was cleaning my room, she recycled the plastic bottles that the children took after drinking.
Not to mention that the cost of a plastic bottle is only 1-2 yuan. The children saw the bottle as cute and drank it while walking around drinking afternoon tea. When they took it out, no staff said no.
It was only on the third day when I was packing my luggage that I realized it was missing. Even a one-yuan plastic bottle in a hotel that cost more than one thousand yuan a night had to be recycled and reused repeatedly. This was the first time I encountered it, and I was too stingy. If the cleaning lady or the front desk informed me in time that day, maybe I would understand better.
The only good thing about the hotel is the location. It is not a traditional five-star hotel. It is a business hotel with internet celebrity effect. It does not even have a makeup mirror. It takes a lot of effort to put on makeup. The lighting in the room is poor and the overall price/performance ratio is not high.
In addition, I don‚Äôt like being chased to write a good review and a string of names before I even check out.
After that, I switched to hotels in Chengdu and Dujiangyan with the same price range, and the comparison was obvious.

The lobby is on the 30th floor, and you have to wait for a while to get on the elevator. The rooms are so-so, a bit like a serviced apar**ent, not worthy of five stars, maybe four stars. , I took a taxi to the hotel, but couldn't find a place to park, so I went around in a circle. If you have a travel plan, choose carefully. The hotel sign is not very obvious. The room was a bit stuffy. I stayed in the last room. There might not be many people staying there. I wanted to change to another room. I said it was stuffy, but the front desk didn't agree and looked very embarrassed. When I checked out, I didn't take the initiative to give out pandas, because the two-night package included free pandas. I booked two rooms for two nights. Later I asked to make up for two pandas, but they said it was because I only got one for each order. I thought it was too much. Yes, I must give a five-star review and give one more as a gift. I am not very satisfied with this attitude and service. I will not choose it again next time. I chose the slightly distinctive one from the three pictures. The entrance on the first floor of the hotel and the bathroom , and the scenery outside the window

The hotel breakfast seems to have many areas, but there is actually nothing to eat and the taste is very average. At the coffee pick-up area, there was a boy who was helping customers draw latte flowers one by one, which resulted in a long line of people waiting in the back. In fact, it was unnecessary. An automatic coffee machine would increase a lot of efficiency, not to mention that the flowers were not pretty. The hotel provides late night snacks but they end at nine o'clock, so every time I come back from shopping, they are actually gone. The funniest thing is that there is a bar in the lobby, but when my friends and I wanted to order a bottle of red wine, there was no bar. We could only order cocktails. There is no red wine in the hotel bar, which is really rare. Other services are quite satisfactory and the room prices are relatively affordable.

When checking in, they did not explain the check-in related matters to me, which caused a small incident later.

The room is very clean and the cleaning lady has a very good service attitude. The location of the hotel is very good. It is very convenient to walk to China International Finance Corporation, Taikoo Li and Chunxi Road. You can come back and rest at any time when you are tired. The hotel provides afternoon tea and late night snacks, which is convenient for replenishing energy. However, I still have to make some comments. There was no socket where the kettle was placed, and there was no socket on the tea table. I had to go to the bathroom to boil water. There was no full-length mirror outside the room, which was inconvenient. Finally, thank you to aim, page, Joey, and Lynn. I hope I will have the opportunity to stay here again.

Although the late night snack is simple, I like it very much. It relieves my tired stomach after a long day. The hotel entrance is on a small road, but you can turn a corner and go to the main road. There are several restaurants on the small road that are delicious and not expensive. There are mobile carts and night food stalls in the evening, which is very Chengdu style.

I still like the afternoon tea. The coffee comes with latte art. I like it very much. It would be better if the milk is replaced with fresh milk.
The late night snack was from 21:00 to 22:00. I was walking around the Kuanzhai Alley and felt that I couldn't catch up, so I asked the housekeeper to leave it for us. Later I felt that I was wise, because many people missed it.
The room is very big, and the intelligent voice controls everything in the room, except for the millet hair dryer that I don't like in the room, it's really pretty but not useful. Another point is that the bathroom door and toilet door are common. I don‚Äôt know if this is why the bathroom door is not sealed, and there is a puddle of water on the ground outside after taking a shower. I see other guests have also reported feedback, and I guess it has not improved.
The hotel is about 10 minutes away from Taikoo Li and IFS. It is very close, and you can see the pandas in IFS from the room. Downstairs there are convenience stores such as Chen Guoguo Milk Tea Shop, Xiaojun Gan Chuanchuan and Family Mart.
When you leave the hotel, you will get a panda doll.
Finally, I would like to thank shine, daisy, Nancy, and leo for their service, I am very satisfied üíóüíóüíó

msg:I don‚Äôt know what everyone‚Äôs requirements are for a parent-child room, but judging by my standards, I can only say that this is a ‚Äúsuperficial‚Äù parent-child room. This parent-child room is only decorated with childlike elements, but there are few things that guests actually need, which is especially unfriendly to small babies. After making the reservation, I called the hotel in advance to request a stroller, but when I arrived, I was informed that there was no crib and a bed bumper was prepared for me. When I got to the room, I discovered that only one bed surround was provided, and I couldn't get another one. There is no small stool for children in the bathroom. Both of our children are not tall enough to brush their teeth. In the end, we had to brush our children's teeth in the shower room. Also, the toothbrush provided for children has very hard bristles, and the toothpaste is even more ridiculous. It contains mint. I didn't pay attention to using it on the child on the first night, and it made the child extremely spicy. In the end, I had to buy children's toothpaste myself. What dissatisfied me the most was that the room was very damp, and the air conditioner blew out odors that even indoor aromatherapy couldn't cover up. People with respiratory sensitivities are not recommended to choose this hotel.
The location of the hotel is indeed very good. It only takes about ten minutes to walk to places like ifc and Chunxi Road. There is a wide range of food, drink, entertainment and shopping nearby. But if you mainly use taxis or self-driving to travel, this place is not suitable because there is a lot of traffic jams, very heavy traffic jams, and the road out of the hotel starts to get jammed.
The front desk staff of the hotel are quite friendly, but the waiters in the breakfast room are just mediocre. The plates left after eating have been left for a long time without anyone taking them away. Several waiters gathered together to chat and did not collect the plates and garbage from the guests' tables.
Overall, the check-in experience was very bad.

msg:There is no harm if there is no comparison. Since I just lived in Furong Pavilion from Xi'an before, when I came here, I felt like the sky was in the sky and the earth was in the same place.
First of all, let‚Äôs talk about the location of the hotel. It‚Äôs in the middle of two subway entrances, which is quite convenient. The guest rooms are very high and have a good view. One side can directly see the pandas in Taikoo Li. (But this is very useful for people traveling to Chengdu. It can only be regarded as the icing on the cake, after all, it is impossible to look out the window in the hotel every day); it is newly renovated, the things in the room are relatively new, and the drinks in the minibar are added every day.
Areas for improvement: There is no hanging rack in the bathroom, so those with children need to use their own towels to dry on the floor after use; there is no storage basket on the floor, and used towels can only be placed on the floor or on the countertop. There are very few breakfast items (even late-night snacks, and I haven‚Äôt had afternoon tea), and the floor is extremely sticky. The waiter didn‚Äôt take the initiative to add chopsticks, spoons, and paper towels to you. I have been doing it myself these days (the only thing the restaurant recognizes is in the morning) The coffee was pretty good, better than most hotels I've stayed in).
The most unbearable thing was that I came back from playing outside on the last day and found a cigarette butt on the floor of the room. I never smoked, and my children were used to walking around barefoot when they came back. It felt really disgusting!
Overall, this hotel can only be regarded as an upgraded Hanting. As far as I am concerned, there is still a gap between the service and the room price of more than 1,500 per night (of course, I have only stayed in this hotel in Chengdu, and it is possible that the price of the hotel in Chengdu is just So high, even if I didn‚Äôt say it).
Finally, I left the hotel and gave the children a panda doll, but the doll, drinks, etc. are just the icing on the cake. Anyone who is willing to stay here wants better service, so personally, I would not go on a parent-child trip again. I chose this one.

It takes seven or eight minutes to walk to the subway downstairs. Check-in on the 30th floor is very smooth. The room area configuration meets the five-star standard. The hotel also provides free washing and drying services. One wears hotel slippers with bare upper body for at least half an hour to exercise. One takes up all three washing machines and three dryers, and there are water and sand cups on the table and floor. I am too lazy to scold this kind of guest. This kind of guest will only cause trouble for the hotel and lower the hotel. Before leaving, the housekeeper Nancy coco daisy Joey thoughtfully gave the panda doll to the child. Thank you very much.

It is convenient to go anywhere. It is only a few steps away by subway, and it is just a block away from the gate The big LED screen, the 3D animation goldfish on it is very eye-catching, each goldfish has its own exclusive name, listen to the concierge brother say to use the microphone to call the name of the goldfish, the little goldfish will turn to look at you, it The corresponding name will also shine. Although I haven't tried it myself, it should be pretty good. You have to go up to the 30th floor to check in. Once you enter, there is a youthful a**osphere. I still like the design style. The attitude of the check-in service staff at the front desk is very good Okay, very kind, I introduced the hotel‚Äôs breakfast, afternoon tea, and supper time in detail. I wanted to rush into the room but I didn‚Äôt finish listening, but the hotel housekeeper sent a long series of messages. If there is something unclear, I will Go through the chat history, or send a message to the housekeeper, and you can still reply in a relatively timely manner. When you have breakfast in the restaurant, you can see the Internet celebrity spot by the window - Panda Butt. The breakfast is very rich, and there are Chengdu special dandan noodles, cold Noodles can save you from having to go out to eat. It is very enjoyable to sit in the restaurant and see the scenery outside the window when the sun is shining during the day. It is very enjoyable to eat afternoon tea. The Kongming lanterns in the atrium are also very beautiful at night. Sitting in the gazebo to take pictures, the effect is very good. Because I have to go to other scenic spots when I leave, I can store my luggage at the front desk, which is very convenient. I also gave me a panda. Fortunately, I didn‚Äôt buy it myself. It‚Äôs a small savings. It‚Äôs a great trip without stepping on thunder. would recommend!

The guest rooms are all above the 30th floor, with good views on both sides, and the rooms are relatively quiet. The lobby is on the 30th floor, and check-in and check-out are very comfortable. The self-service gym and laundry room are conveniently located on the 31st floor.
I especially like the lobby bar of the hotel. There are not many varieties of afternoon tea but it is more distinctive. If the flight is late, sit by the window after check-out and watch the giant pandas climbing Taikoo Li and enjoy afternoon tea. It feels like Chengdu. I especially like the little brothers and sisters at the bar. The Chengdu dialect and Mandarin are seamlessly converted, and the a**osphere of life is strong, which makes the guests feel more cordial and warm. Because of their mutual friendliness, the little brother at the bar even gave the two daughters panda plush toys. The line can be described as perfect!
The resident immersive musicals on the fifth and second floors of the hotel are also unexpected surprises for the two daughters. Next time they come, they will choose Junting.

msg:The hotel does not seem to be a whole building. To enter the downstairs entrance, you must first take the elevator to reach the actual hotel floor. After exiting the elevator, you have to transfer twice before reaching the check-in lobby. If you take a taxi, be careful that the car cannot be used like other five-star hotels. You drive directly to the hotel lobby door, and the hotel opens the door for you and takes your luggage in. The taxi can only park on the roadside of the hotel, and you carry your luggage across the sidewalk to the hotel. When there are many people in the breakfast area, I have experienced the situation of having to grab a seat. It is too busy and there is no waiter to help you arrange a seat and help you get coffee. The main focus is to be self-reliant and have a sharp eye. Our room is not as normal as other five-star hotels. The level of cleanliness - the balcony glass door was not wiped clean, there was a little hair in the sink, forget it, I actually picked up a piece of foot skin on the footstool in front of the bed with my bare hands. I was really shocked at the time, and later I saw it next to the bed. There is a small subtle milky white stain on the sofa seat. If you say this place has four stars, I can barely accept it. If you insist on saying that this place has five stars, it is really unnecessary. People who prefer to book a five-star basic hotel do not recommend this place. , I don‚Äôt come to Chengdu often. Next time I come, I wonder if it might be better to go to an international chain hotel with a basic five-star hotel price. This time I visited several cities from north to south, and they were all five-star hotels. This one in Chengdu is too big. collapsed

The only regret is that the Coke Sprite inside is the 0-sugar version, which is not suitable for my fat house hahahahaha~ Bye bye pagoda, see you next time

There was a lot of luggage with the child, but the hotel doorman turned a blind eye and made no attempt to help load the luggage into the car. Never seen such service staff. In addition, the air conditioner in the hotel was broken and kept blowing out hot air. After consulting, he said that the temperature has been low recently and the central air conditioner can only be adjusted to a minimum of 25. This is too ridiculous. Any air conditioner must be able to both heat and cool, right? We were forced to sleep with the sliding door open all night. Absolutely

It is indeed one of the few hotel brands that can be listed on the market. The selection of facilities in the guest rooms all reflect that it is a hotel with a design theme. The latex mattress is very comfortable, the shower gel can be used day and night, and there is also facial cleanser. The small asparagus bonsai placed makes people feel happy. The only thing that is not easy to use is the Xiaomi hair dryer. The air collector will be blown off if it cannot absorb it. It is best to add a small shelf in the shower room. I still prefer to bring some personal care products or brush my teeth while taking a bath. There is no place to put things. The hotel is equipped with buffet breakfast, buffet afternoon tea, buffet supper, exquisite and hygienic. The transportation is very convenient, you can walk to ifs Taikoo Li on Chunxi Road, and you can go around the famous scenic spots by special car for 20 yuan. The service staff are warm and hospitable and respond in a timely manner. When you check in, you will explain in detail the various services that the hotel can provide, and praise the three staff members Xiao Le/Ma/Li by name, making you feel at home in every possible way.

First of all, because the child went to Chengdu for the first time, I contacted the hotel before departure, and wanted to give the child a better sense of ceremony. The staff Xiao Yang, Xiao Zhou, Xiao Ma, and Xiao He were very thoughtful and helped me purchase a lot of small items and put them in the room in advance. On the day the child went, I was very happy! (ps: When you check out, tell me that you will stay here again next time you go to Chengdu.)
Secondly, we stayed for a few days, and when the daily staff cleaned the room, they had a sense of proportion and did not make me feel uncomfortable at all.
Finally, I would like to say that I would like to thank all the staff of Pagoda Junting for their careful care these days. Our trip to Chengdu was very pleasant.
By the way, this hotel is really close to Taikoo Li and Chunxi Road, and it takes only a few minutes to walk with the children.

msg:The location of the hotel is about 5 minutes away from IFS, and it takes about 8 minutes to walk to Chunxi Road subway station. The location is good. The rooms are above the 30th floor. If you choose the right direction, you can look towards IFS.
There are not many choices of food for breakfast in the hotel, and the taste is not bad. The hotel has afternoon tea and supper. We are out all day and have no chance to taste it.
We live in a deluxe twin room. The design of the room is good. There are two washbasins in the bathroom. The toilet and shower room are designed with sliding doors. You can only choose to close one of them. If you live with friends, you should consider it. The MINIBAR in the room The first day is free.
When the hotel checks in, WECHAT will be added to provide butler service. If you have any needs, you can contact the hotel through WECHAT. The response speed is fast. For takeaway, the hotel does not provide the service of collecting takeaway. The takeaway staff will place the takeaway in the takeaway box on the ground floor of the hotel , You need to go downstairs to pick up the takeaway by yourself.
In the room we stayed in, one of the windows was opened for some reason. It is estimated that it was opened by the previous guest. The hotel did not check it clearly when cleaning the room. In addition, the shower room has a rain shower and a ceiling shower. Our first day After returning to the hotel after going out at night, I found that the shower and the controller of the shower were broken, and the shower could not be used. I reported it to the hotel immediately. I came back from going out one night and found that there was no maintenance. This is really hard to understand. I reported to the hotel that the hotel suggested changing to the same room type or taking a bath in the adjacent room, but it is too tiring to go out for a day. Let‚Äôs forget it. I hope the hotel Fang Duoduo pays attention to details.
In terms of bedding, for me personally, the pillows are too soft, and the mattress is a bit hard.
There is a coffee shop on the left side of the hotel entrance, if you are interested, you can try it.
During our stay, we happened to meet the Sugar and Wine Fair in Chengdu. The hotel price was 1800 per night. To be honest, there are better choices for this price, or the hotel should improve its service level.

I can blow the natural wind at home, but I still need to travel thousands of kilometers to come to you and pay this price to blow the natural wind? There were not even disposable gloves at breakfast. I asked the waiter and the answer was that they only had blue rubber gloves used in hospitals. I was so speechless. The same was true for takeaways. The management was a mess.

The location is quiet and convenient. It is less than ten minutes' walk from the subway station to Chunxi Road Station. It is very convenient to travel and dine in the surrounding area. There are several authentic Sichuan restaurants opposite the hotel.
The environment is neat and clean, the room is spacious, and the breakfast tastes good.
The key point is that there was an incident on the second night of my stay. There was a power outage in the room at around two o'clock in the middle of the night. After reporting it to the front desk, they quickly processed the room change. However, although the changed room was said to be an upgraded room type, The size of the bedroom and balcony has been greatly reduced. There is an extra bathtub in the bathroom, but it is not used at the current time. The smart guy in the room cannot respond to commands.
Changing rooms in the middle of the night was already causing inconvenience, but the room experience after the change was much worse. During the whole process, the two staff members had a good attitude and took the initiative to help pack the luggage, which was good. The reason why I didn't complain about the changed room immediately was because the staff had a good attitude, and it was the Mid-Autumn Festival and I didn't want to cause trouble in the middle of the night. The attitude was good, but the result was poor. When I checked out, the front desk expected me to give a positive review, but I still reviewed it truthfully. Changing the room was a matter of course. There was no subsequent compensation plan, so overall I was dissatisfied.

The service of the Indigo Hotel in Jiusaigou and Yingjia Gaokong Fuyun Hotel in Chengdu that I stayed in during this trip was far behind in terms of service! It was even more exasperating to stay for 3 days, and told the main station to change the garbage bags in the room. I forgot, and I returned to the hotel in the afternoon to ask the waiter to deal with it, saying that I didn't receive a call from the main station! It is the same Chengdu design hotel brand as Yingjia, and the price difference is not too much, but compared with Yingjia Gaokong Fuyun Gaokong Hotel, it is much worse in terms of location, service, and hardware facilities, which is quite disappointing!

First of all, the hotel is really new, clean, smart, and modern. Compared with the old-fashioned five-star hotels, I prefer this kind of hotel with modern decoration, and the rooms are not easy to leave clean dead ends. This Junting Hotel is very friendly to senior allergic rhinitis patients like me. The hotel's breakfast is also quite good, a little surprise; the room even provides a facial mask, which is so considerate, I used one piece and thought it was pretty good. All in all, the toiletries are good; the location of the hotel is super good, and it is very convenient to walk to TaiKoo Hui and Chunxi Road. Although it is in the downtown area, the hotel is well insulated and there is no noise at night. There are also many places to eat around, small restaurants, food stalls, high-end restaurants...all of them. It is only 2.3 kilometers to Kuanzhai Alley/People's Park. If the weather is good, it is strongly recommended to ride a shared bicycle; there is also a laundry room and a gym. In short, the experience of staying is no worse than that of the old five-star hotel, and it is a good choice for business trips and travel. Ms. Yang, the floor supervisor on the 36th floor, is great and very welcoming. And Xiaole Xiaoma, accompany me to the police station to check in and register (I forgot to bring my ID card...üòì)

msg:I often travel on business or with my family, and have stayed in various hotels for many times. This time I had a very good accommodation experience in Chengdu Pagoda. The service is very good and warm, and it is more humane.

I have always been a person with high requirements for services. This accommodation experience makes me sincerely want to write some comments and recommend more people like me to experience the facilities of this hotel and their high-quality services , it is worth to experience!
For example, the elder brother in the front lobby on the first floor remembers that we bought a few bottles of mineral water and went back to the hotel to drink. The elder brother on the first floor saw it and kindly reminded the hotel that it is available 24 hours a day, so don‚Äôt buy it specially. Wow, it‚Äôs so warm, I must praise it one!
And the auntie who takes supper is very considerate. When it comes to supper, this hotel gives me something special besides afternoon tea. It has supper, which makes me feel so comfortable and dependent on supper.
I also want to mention that the front desk staff Xiao Le, Xiao Qiang, and Xiao Yang have excellent service. They even gave me a surprise when I checked out, a cute panda doll, click üëç. In fact, there are more silent hotel service staff, which cannot be listed here one by one, and they have been providing services to our customers with their hearts.

In addition to hotel equipment and services, the surrounding environment of the hotel is also great, just next to IFS and Taikoo Li, just a few minutes' walk away, and the city view outside the window is very good. Seeing Ctrip's rating of 4.8 points, I feel that it is low, at least 4.9, and 5.0 is too inflated, so we need to continue to work hard and make persistent efforts!

However, there is also a small suggestion. The service staff can't keep up with the breakfast. It feels too busy. The hotel should recruit more service staff if it is considered comprehensively.
Finally, I would like to give the hotel a supper!

The laundry room and gym are similar to Atour.
What I am more speechless about is the breakfast. I booked a family room with 4 breakfasts. I had to go out to see the giant pandas at 7 o'clock that morning, so I asked the hotel to pack 4 breakfasts. It turned out to be two ordinary croissants, a box of yogurt, and a Ice boiled eggs, an unwashed appleüôÑüôÑüôÑ
Although I asked the front desk when I checked in, I was told that the hotel did not have a star rating, but at this price in Chengdu, it is definitely a five-star hotel. This kind of product really shocked me. From now on, it‚Äôs better not to trust any high-scoring designer hotels. It‚Äôs definitely a good idea to stay in a five-star hotel with an established chain.

I finally chose to stay in this hotel because I saw someone say that there is a small balcony in the room and you can see pandas. pp, you can take a lot of beautiful photos on the balcony at night, it is really very attractive. There is a beautiful 3D animation of goldfish in the entrance hall on the first floor of the hotel, which is very eye-catching. The front desk is on the 30th floor. The moment you enter the door, give People have a very fresh feeling, and the layout of the front desk is quite simple, but the main focus of this hotel is to design hotels, hehe! I also like it. The girls at the front desk of the hotel provide good service. They will explain all the precautions during the stay in the hotel clearly. You can also add the WeChat account of the little butler at the front desk. If you have any problems during the stay in the hotel, you can find him to solve it, which is fast and efficient. The first feeling when entering the room is that it is new, clean and hygienic. The minibar is free to use. The second feeling is that the color of the room is well matched. The things used are very high-end and smart. You can control the TV and curtains by voice, which is very convenient. Went to have breakfast the next day, the breakfast was not bad, local hot food was also available. Overall good! Recommended!

I want to ask the front desk to help collect it. The answer is "it is self-service and cannot be collected." There is no note. Residents can't mark which machine their clothes are in, which is convenient when they go out. Others Put them together when you clean them up, so you won't take them by mistake.

The room includes breakfast, afternoon tea, and supper, but because my best friend and I want to taste Chengdu cuisine, we didn't eat at the hotel, so it should be good
Special thanks to the little butler for always answering all questions. The surrounding food recommended to me is affordable and delicious, but it is a bit spicy. There is no way that people here will not like spicy food.

1. Entering the gate, the 3D animation on the big screen attracted me. The staff introduced that there will be pictures of many scenic spots in Chengdu in the background. The fish swimming on it is called "Half Son" because the pandas in Chengdu are black and white, so Half of the children are also black and white.
2. The check-in area on the 30th floor is on the right side when you get out of the elevator, and you end up walking to the restaurant. The front desk is on the left side. The open bar has no sense of distance at all, and there are coffee, tea, and biscuits next to it, all of which are not bad.
3. I took a look at the self-service laundry room and gym on the 31st floor. After all, I am not a sports person, haha! Panda butts can also be seen from the small balcony of the gym.
4. The room is relatively new, and the intelligent voice system is simply a blessing for lazy people. The room has large floor-to-ceiling windows, and the night view is also great...

Naturally, he demanded compensation, which was rejected. In a few days, except for the butler who replied with a question mark, no one came out to care about this matter! After staying in the hotel for a few days, no protective measures were taken to deal with the same sharp problem of the three elevator covers, even if the sharp parts were glued down with tape, it was very irresponsible! Shirk responsibility to the property company, it is their elevator. I complained to Ctrip, and the serious supervisor was willing to help repair it after communication. The hotel management unit paid for it, and the hotel gave a few hundred yuan in red envelopes! The down jacket is a moncler with more than 10,000 yuan, is it a worn-out garment? The booked room is about 1700 per night, and the room fee is more than 10,000. How can the personal safety of customers be so cheap? ? ? The breakfast is full, the tableware is not clean, there are finger prints on the busy day, and the placemats are not washed? Tell me if you don't wash it, just wipe it and use it! Only the attitude of the room attendant is okay! Such a hotel? Customers have to think about it! !

Minibar all-you-can-drink: There is almost nothing, just two bottles of water and two bottles of Coke. This is too bad for a hotel at this price.
Order late night snacks. There are obviously robots delivering food. But no, the guests all go to the 30 lobby to pick up their meals.
There is no ventilation in the elevator, let alone air conditioning. In this sauna day in Chengdu, you can imagine that the price is really not worth it.
Not to mention the price is twice as expensive as that of Yaduobi across the street. It‚Äôs not worth it.
Eat breakfast before peak hours. There are few dining tables and many guests have no place to sit. The variety is average and nothing special.
The double bed room is the first room on each floor. If you want to change rooms, you have to pay more. It is more than 1,500. The room is really not as good as ordinary chain hotels.

The guest rooms are cleaned carefully, and the rooms are cleaned up after many visits. I also helped the children arrange all the books.
The only downside is the elevator. The first floor is very windy, and the elevator often cannot close the door. Went down to get takeaway one night, a lot of people gathered for this reason. Everyone thought the elevator was broken, and there was a little panic.

Service: I really didn‚Äôt notice the service. I fell hard in the lobby during breakfast time because of the lack of signs on the ground. It was right next to the front desk. No one came forward to check. I was in a hurry to get up and eat breakfast silently. When I came back at noon The front desk took the takeaway and reported it, but did not get the slightest empathy feedback. I asked if there was a lack of signs on the ground. She said there was a light *****. I asked if I took a photo in the morning. She said there was a specified time to open, but there was still no sign. Ah, not a word of apology at all. After checking out in the afternoon, I went to report the situation again, and what I got was that I would follow up with the superior feedback, which was really annoying! Three or four days after I got home, my knees were still bruised, both legs. Such a price and such a service is really nothing to say~

Before checking in, I called the lady at the front desk and asked to arrange an orientation Good room, the lady recommended a room where you can see the panda's butt. We booked a double bed room with a small balcony. It is really beautiful to watch the night view and take pictures on the balcony at night.
The service of the brothers and sisters at the front desk is really great. From check-in on the first floor to check-out at the end, I especially like the tall little brother at the front desk. He is handsome and humorous. When he finally left the store, he gave it as a gift A little panda, very cute, I really like it üòò.
The room is very clean, comfortable and smart, giving people a feeling of coming home. When I get back to the room, I like to lean on the sofa and look at the night view outside. I really enjoy it üòé! Breakfast and afternoon tea are very rich in variety. There are Chinese food and Western food for breakfast. There are a lot of Sichuan specialties, all of which are delicious. The desserts for afternoon tea are also very rich. Take some small cakes, serve a cup of coffee, and sit by the window On the sofa, basking in the little sun, drinking coffee and eating desserts, it is really a kind of enjoyment! During special times, pear soup is also cooked, which is very considerate.
In the evening, there is also a free supper delivered to the room, prepared with small glutinous rice balls, adding a touch of warmth in this cold winter. The goldfish animation on the first floor gives people a very advanced feeling. According to the lady at the front desk, you can use your mobile phone to scan the QR code in the atrium on the 30th floor to watch the same 3D goldfish animation as on the first floor. I tried it and it really works on my phone. It was a great surprise to see goldfish!
The check-in experience is very good, and I will still choose this hotel next time I come to Chengdu

The third point is that we booked for two nights and the room on the second day did not change anything at all.

There are only 3 elevators in total and I have to wait for a long time every time. The TV in the room went black every few minutes for some unknown reason, and no one came to turn down the bed. The paper towels I threw on the sink in the morning were still there when I came back in the evening. Oh, by the way, because there is no trash can or paper towels on the sink. Girls don‚Äôt even have a makeup mirror, and it‚Äôs so dark that they can‚Äôt put on makeup.
The most disgusting thing is that one night, I opened the quilt and there were small pieces of garbage inside. I felt a little disgusted at that time and hurriedly patted it away without taking any pictures.
It is worth mentioning that there are too few varieties of breakfast. It is 4-star standard at most. It is not worth getting up early for breakfast.
There are balconies in hotel rooms over 30 years old, but there are no safety measures, just railings. Those with children are advised not to go there.
After reading other reviews, those who singled me out for praise are all dragging me down! Only if you take your services seriously can you run a good business~

Write less bad reviews, because I think it is not easy for everyone to compare their hearts with each other, but this time it is really chilling, and your family is not bad for me as a customer. I just wrote it to avoid lightning for everyone! Just got out of the car and arrived at the entrance of the hotel. The little brother at the door watched us dragging our luggage indifferently. He didn't say hello and didn't help to drag the luggage. The attitude of the front desk is just like that. When we got to the room, the smell of the decoration was spicy to the eyes, and even the N95 was choking Nose, calling the front desk and changing the room, not many breakfast items, not delicious, staff playing mobile phones on the frying pan, ignoring guests, and one more thing, can such a big hotel afford a robot? It takes at least 30 minutes to an hour to deliver a meal from the first floor to the room. The meal is cold when it arrives, and the aunt who cleans us is still in the sun. I started to have a high fever on the third day, and it was difficult to borrow a thermometer from the front desk. , And obviously I have been told that I have a high fever, can I hurry up and deliver the takeaway upstairs, I can‚Äôt get up anymore, but I still have the same attitude, shouldn‚Äôt a good hotel put customers first? It makes people feel like going home, I really will never choose this hotel again,

msg:Generally speaking, the service, location, breakfast, etc. are quite satisfactory. It is because it is a new hotel room. There is still a strong smell in the room. The waiter brought an air purifier. The smell will be a little weaker only when the window is opened. I hope to improve it quickly. Return When we were in the room, my brother gave a little panda as a gift

msg:I stayed here because it was a new hotel, but the hygiene of the hotel was obviously not good enough. I walked around barefoot and my whole feet were black. When I checked out, I found a pair of underwear or socks left by a previous hotel in the corner of the bed. It's there, but I'm afraid it's dirty and hasn't been removed. If the hotel is interested, you can go to the bedside of Room 3**1 and have a look. It should still be there, and the service and attitude are not online. They will find reasons to send customers away and act like they don't want to. Helpful note: This is my birthday celebration hotel‚ãØ‚ãØObviously I got the wrong one

msg:My friends are full of praise for the hotel I booked and are very satisfied. The location is very convenient, close to the center of IFC, in the old alleys in the downtown area, it is really a quiet place in the midst of the hustle and bustle. The decoration style of the hotel is simple and elegant, and the combination of log color and light green is very comfortable. The room is also simple and elegant, and the refrigerator looks good. We changed to a twin room with two sinks! The facilities are also very complete, and there is a hair rope inside the shower cap, which is really thin! There are both Chinese and Western dishes for breakfast, and the coffee staff will prepare and deliver them immediately. In short, it is a very, very cost-effective designer hotel in the urban area! Five-star recommendation! There are so many snacks in the alley of the hotel! There is a noodle restaurant on the opposite side. A friend from Chengdu said that the business of the old noodle restaurant is particularly good. We ate it twice!

The geographical environment of the hotel is very good. It takes about 5 minutes to walk to Chunxi Road Pedestrian Street and 10 minutes to Taikoo Li. Because it is in the city center, it takes less than 20 minutes to go to the main attractions. It is very easy to take a taxi!
There are also a lot of restaurants near the hotel, and there are many choices of all kinds!
The hotel opened in 2022. All the facilities are very new. The hotel lobby on the first floor is very stylish. The breakfast is also OK. As for the room, it has everything that should be there. The bed is big and very comfortable. Because of the balcony, the ventilation is very good! I lived for two days, and I slept until 9 o'clock on both days, haha!
Thanks again for Aim's service, I will stay here again next time I come to Chengdu!

2. The air conditioner cannot adjust the temperature. Tell me it is a central air conditioner.
3. There are very few breakfast items and cannot be prepared in advance for guests to pick up.

The unit price of the hotel is not cheap, but it is not as good as other five-star hotels in the same price range. Except for the electric curtains and voice control, which are a little bit more advanced. Overall very disappointed.

msg:As a diamond member of Ctrip, I usually don‚Äôt comment on hotels, but the experience in Chengdu really surprised me. The hotel felt like it was renovated from an office building (I don‚Äôt know if this is correct). The check-in area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel is on the 30th floor. There is a concierge on the building, and the service attitude of the concierge is quite good. When it rains, he will take the initiative to ask if he wants to use an umbrella. The check-in went smoothly, mainly in the guest room. There was water seepage in the bathroom, and I finished washing in the shower room. After taking a shower, there will be water in the bathroom. It should be that the sealant is not applied properly. Secondly, the kettle that boils water is very limited, as long as you don't turn it off. This kettle can keep boiling until the water is boiled, and the pot is full. A pot of water was boiled for me after I finished taking a shower. Thirdly, there is no phone in the room. I completely rely on the so-called tablet to call the front desk, which is fine if it is easy to use. It is really difficult to use. I turned the tablet off and on but it didn't work. You can set the temperature of the air conditioner on the panel. After I clicked on it, it told me to turn on the air conditioner first, but I clearly had the air conditioner on!! The food delivery robot made a small knock on the door. It couldn't be any quieter. I couldn't hear the sound at all. I called the front desk on my mobile phone and they replied that I didn't open the door and the robot went back by itself!! There is hair on the bedside lamp in room 3301 that has not been cleaned. I don't know this room. How does the cleaning lady clean the clothes hanger at the door? The light on the clothes hanger in the wardrobe at the door is human-induced. I have to hold something back and forth and swing the light back and forth in the closet before the light turns on. I am really speechless. How can there be such a design!! If it happens again I will definitely not choose this hotel again when I go to Chengdu without taking photos. After the official reads this review, you can go to room 3301 to see if what I said is true.

msg:I have been traveling in Chengdu for four days. I booked Taikoo Li Xiyue at the beginning. When I checked in, I found that the room was very small, which was at the same level as the whole season. The market price made up for the difference), and I was so angry that I changed to this hotel the next day. Obviously, the room is much bigger, and the price is also very reasonable. Five-star praise, I am very glad that I returned the booked Xiyue at that time (Shanghai Xiyue is still very good, The management of Xiyue in Chengdu is really poor), and the breakfast here is much richer. Except for noodles, Xiyue‚Äôs breakfast is basically cold, but here is hot. Wendy in the food and beverage depar**ent has sharp eyes. Seeing that I brought a child, I paid half the price for breakfast, but the advantage is that there are many varieties and good service, and I think the supplement price is reasonable. The downside is that you can‚Äôt add quilts. I read many reviews that can‚Äôt meet this requirement. The hotel should prepare more quilts. Also, the room smells a bit. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because of the wrong fragrance or something. It‚Äôs better to open the windows for ventilation. I still give it five points, mainly because compared to Xiyue, this one is great immediately

msg:Once I arrived at the design of the hotel parking lot, I won‚Äôt complain about it. You have experienced it yourself when driving. In short, we managed to park in the underground parking lot after going around twice. Several of us took a few big boxes and small bags, and there was nothing at all. The staff came to help carry the suitcases. We arrived during the hottest two days in Chengdu. The hotel lobby looked nice and cool, and the check-in was quick. But when we took the elevator to the check-in floor on the 35th floor, we found that the corridor was not air-conditioned at all. The degree of stuffiness is really indescribable. I didn‚Äôt turn on the air conditioner when I got to the room. I turned it on after I went in. I ordered some errands to buy some daily necessities at night. The delivery guy said it was delivered to the concierge. Delivered the food to the room and told me to go downstairs to pick it up üòä. When I checked out, the service staff told me to write a (good) review. I said I would write it later, but she actually asked me to write it now, black question mark Face üòÇ, and every time we leave the hotel from the parking lot, we have to call the front desk to report the license plate number, and then the ink marks open the door for a long time. Is it difficult to synchronize the parking lot system with the hotel? Can't enter the license plate number? Can't you just hand in a ticket when you go out for the last time? Moreover, on the day we left, we spent 10 minutes in the parking lot and did not open the gate. We paid the parking fee of ¬•75 to let us out. It was really speechless! A really bad review! The hotel management level of the Express Hotel, that is, the location is well located in the city center, and there is nothing else that can satisfy me. ps: The service attitude of the waiters in black clothes in the hotel is still remarkable

The hotel in this location has a large parking lot. Very convenient, no need to queue up to park in Taikoo Li. The hotel floor is very high. You can see the beautiful night view of Chengdu. My room had a clear view of the TV tower. The location of the hotel's lobby, I want to do it again in spring, saying that I can see the Xiling Snow Mountain. The hotel breakfast is also very rich.

The smartness of the room is like a decoration, and the air conditioner is humming when it is turned to the minimum. There is also a lot of hardware that doesn't work. The butler, Aga, has a good service attitude. I won't stay in this hotel next time. Although I gave a panda doll when I left, it can't make up for my feeling of spending so much money to stay in such a hotel.

msg:In addition to the high floor, the service is OK, and there is a parking lot for free.
There are no other advantages, sorry for the price of 1300+!
The balcony of the room cannot go out, and the glass is gray. The reason for choosing a high-rise hotel is to see the night view, but the balcony cannot go out in the hotel introduction. Not worth it anyway

msg:The hardware facilities of the hotel are very good. The service of Ms. Kaye on the first floor is very thoughtful and friendly. I like it! But other than that, room service is really bad! ! First of all, when I checked in, I found that my room was half-cleaned. There were used napkins on the table and a used towel on the sink. I was asked to change rooms at the front desk. As a result, I waited for a long time at the front desk to help me. deal with. The second thing I wanted was a sewing kit, first it was sent to the wrong room, and then I forgot what I wanted. For a hotel of the same grade and price, this is the worst room service I have ever stayed in.

There is basically no service, and the hotel's breakfast is particularly unpalatable. The decoration in the room is very smelly. The smart toilet is not smart. The staff replied That's it, I will never choose this hotel again, it really has nothing to do with five stars, it's better than all seasons
