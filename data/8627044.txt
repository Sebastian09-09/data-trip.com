msg:General people’s impression about Sanya hotels are crowded mainland tourists .But this trip I found exactly the opposite. 
We arrived in Sanya Rosewood in non peak season. A lot of well trained staffs offers excellent services … restaurants food are delicious , house keeper are kind hearted , responsive and generous . Kids hv a lot of activities like cooking making, ornament design, and kite flying….  many times  , our family was the guest in the sky swimming pool .. 
Nowhere else you can have such indulgence and privileges. 

Unforgettable experience ! Super deal!

msg:Had an amazing stay, staff were very helpful, especially Nancy our appointed butler, she make our stay really enjoyable. The 2 infinity pools are really cool, with enough loungers and few wooden cabin (semi private and offer shading). 2 points to mentioned tho regards to the service: had to queue for breakfast on both morning, no seating were provided, a lake of care towards customers here. Also English level of most of the staff were limited, surprisingly. Luckily Nancy was always available so it didn’t affect our stay.

In addition, the hotel is surrounded by stunning beaches and crystal clear waters, whether it is snorkeling or relaxing in the sun, you can enjoy the holiday. The professional service and thoughtful care of the hotel staff make people feel at home. Overall, Rosewood Hotel Sanya is one of the best hotels to visit in Sanya and is the perfect choice for both business and holiday travel.

msg:Mixed feelings about this hotel. We arrived early and got early check in, which is nice and special preparation for birthday celebration etc. however staff and management of this hotel are very under trained. First of all, luggage was mixed up and sent someone else’s to our room. That first night they hosted in their pitch some company’s event which is fairly noisy and even heard karaoke singing throughout the night. When we try to complain, staff only replied systematic replies, said no notification for such events and later confirm that there is (after a few complaints). They also refer me by “laws” the people from that company can do as they want till 9pm. This is very unbearably for 5 stars hotel standard like rosewood. The next morning, similar things happened. Yoga class at 8am blasting music at the same pitch. Overall it’s a very nice hotel but service is not up to standard at all. 

硬件很好，可惜其他地方对不起瑰丽这个品牌。草坪租出去公司活动，一整晚在唱ktv。服务生机械式回话，完全不是五星级的水平。

如果需要，我可以提供几个视频给参考。

The hotel photographer was very professional and helped me with a lot of my model poses. The pictures came out so great that I bought 15 additional photos! The hotel is extremely beautiful and the beach view along with the infinity pool made the stay perfect! The pancakes, waffles and salmon were extremely delicious!

However by lucky they “refused” my cancel application while upgraded my order to the 180 angle ocean view room!  This finally gave us a chance to experience a tremendous journey at Rosewood. Fantastic view, great facilities, wonderful services (reception, concierge, bartender, restaurant waitress, housekeepers etc). We really enjoyed everything during our stay, esp the celebration of our 9th anniversary! See you around Rosewood Sanya.

We stayed in three hotels during this trip and Rosewood is the best.  The room is designed very nicely with great view.  It would make it even better to add for example some swings, football net, etc on the large lawn hotel has.  Add more cabana chairs on the beach.  Arrange some live band for entertainment in the evening.

There were screaming chaotic little kids all over the rooftop pool. I asked why and they said that little kids are allowed if accompanied by their parents! As if a 6 year old would come to the rooftop pool without his parents??  That is NOT what the hotel policy states and it is false advertising and fraudulent. Kids and their parents can use the huge garden pool downstairs. If you claim that your rooftop pool is not for children you damn well better provide that for folks paying crazy high rates for your hotel. Really REALLY disappointed.

msg:Location and transportation:
Located in Haitang Bay, it has its own coastline, but of course you can't go swimming in the sea.
Room view:
I booked a sea view suite with a private swimming pool. The pool in the room is spacious and you can play in the water. The scenery is really unbeatable. The balcony of the suite is big enough to have a party.
Room facilities:
The room facilities are complete, and fruits and champagne are delivered every day. I really can't finish the fruit. But the toiletries are fixed on the wall, which is very inconvenient. It's hard to squeeze when it's almost gone, so I suggest you adjust it.
The bathtub is a distance from the bathroom, which makes the whole room wet. Haha
Breakfast:
The breakfast is semi-buffet, and the food is quite rich. The opening time is also relatively late, so you can eat it as brunch. You can also eat local specialty noodles.
Gym:
I like the gym very much. The equipment is very clean and new, but it would be better if the equipment is more complete.
Swimming pool:
The opening time of the swimming pool is a bit unreasonable. I couldn't swim in both pools later in the evening. The scenery and comfort of the infinity pool are amazing.
Service:
Special thanks to Ryan for taking care of me during my stay and taking the trouble to meet my needs. I felt very at home.
If you want to come to Sanya for a vacation, I highly recommend the Rosewood Hotel. I will come again.

The Poly Rosewood Sanya Hotel is like a wise man standing proudly and farsightedly in Haitang Bay. After seeing all the beautiful scenery in the world, he chose to own a tropical garden and stepped garden in Haitang Bay, telling his life experience and sharing his transcendent taste with the endless stream of travelers. At night, lying in the sky mansion like a seaside villa in a dream, listening to the symphony of tides and wind, the resonance of waves and birds, drinking a homemade cocktail, looking at the twinkling lights of Wuzhizhou Island in front of you, I suddenly felt relieved in my heart. Life is like this. If you want, this moment will be forever. It happened to be a cloudy day full of haziness, but it is also another kind of beauty, self-sustaining, quiet and determined. The flowers bloomed by themselves, the moon rose by itself, and everything was perfect.
This time I met my former store manager Ryan, he is still as excellent as ever, I hope he can go to the next level here.

This time, I was fortunate to stay in this hotel because of a friend's introduction. It was as if I was in a luxurious and magnificent dream:🌟The room is exquisitely decorated, and every detail shines with extreme brilliance;🌧️On rainy mornings, it was sp****, as if the whole world was quiet just for me;😌When I checked in, the super soft and comfortable bedding made me feel incomparable pampering. I didn't expect that the room also had silent earplugs, which brought me a quiet and beautiful night.

In addition, the hotel's service is even more surprising:✨The guest experience manager @@@@ is kind and polite, making me feel at home. She personally checked in and coordinated the room for us, introduced in detail all the places we could go to in the hotel, made an appointment for a golf experience, and also made an appointment for travel photography. At 7 o'clock in the morning, I took a yoga class in the sky lobby on the 14th floor, relaxed my whole body, admired the sunrise, and welcomed a beautiful day; and the infinity pool allowed me to see the magnificent scenery on the other side of the island, as if I was in the clouds, it was really beautiful! What I like most is the sky lobby on the 14th floor of the hotel, just like home. I feel that no one will disturb me when I come to study in the morning. There are also people handing me drinks and towels. The service is really comprehensive!

During the few days in Sanya Poly Rosewood, everything here exceeded my expectations. Whether it was breakfast or the supplies arranged by the housekeeper, it made me more eager for a better life. I really wanted to come out to relax, and it was also strongly recommended by my friends. It was the right choice to book this place for me! I always feel that every trip should be a baptism of the soul, and you need to find inner peace and tranquility in luxury and comfort. I will come back again during the Chinese New Year.

msg:I have stayed in many hotels in Sanya. If I come to Sanya again, there will be no more than five hotels on the list that I will definitely consider, and Poly Rosewood must be on the list.
The hotel itself is not big, but it has everything. The 180° full sea view room I stayed in included the Hainan rice from the fisherman's house. The amount was really too much, and two people couldn't finish it at all. It was very delicious.
The hotel's gym even had Fiture's fitness mirror, which was a pleasant surprise for a gym with almost no people.
Needless to say, the infinity pool and spiral staircase are check-in points. It is worth mentioning that the swimming pool downstairs is really huge, and because of the shade of the trees, some areas can still be shielded from the sun🌞.
Annie, the housekeeper who was very considerate throughout the whole process, responded promptly to my many feedbacks, and even some of the feedbacks were adjusted in the afternoon after the feedback in the morning. It is really efficient and nice. When I left, I also gave a small gift. It can be said that choosing Rosewood is one of the best choices among the many hotels in this trip to Sanya.

msg:Rosewood Sanya is a hotel that deserves my deep praise, especially its refreshing sea view rooms and the infinity pool and bar on the roof, which have added countless beautiful memories to my trip to Sanya. Here, I would like to share my accommodation experience in detail, especially to recommend a particularly caring employee Annie, whose service made me feel like I was back home.

The first thing to mention is the sea view room of the hotel. The room is spacious and comfortable, and every detail reflects the pursuit of high quality. Open the window, and the endless sea is in full view, and the sea breeze blows on your face, making you forget the hustle and bustle of the city in an instant. In the early morning, when the first ray of sunlight shines through the curtains on the bedside, waking up with the sound of waves, this feeling is undoubtedly one of the most wonderful moments of the entire vacation.

The hotel's rooftop infinity pool is another surprise. The pool is designed very cleverly, as if the sky is connected to the horizon, giving people the illusion of floating in the air while swimming. The water is crystal clear, whether it is the first ray of sunlight in the morning or the sunset at dusk, the swimming pool area is the best place to take pictures, and it is also my favorite place to relax every day.

Adjacent to the pool is the hotel's rooftop bar, which has a rich selection of drinks and a relaxed and pleasant a**osphere. Here, I enjoyed several sunset cocktail hours, each of which was a double feast for the eyes and taste. The bar staff is very professional, and the cocktails they mix are both delicious and creative, which is a rare enjoyment during the entire vacation.

During this trip, what touched me most was Annie's caring service. From the moment I stepped into the hotel, Annie greeted me with her warm smile. She not only helped me with the check-in procedures, but also introduced the various facilities of the hotel and the surrounding tourist information in detail. During my stay, Annie was always able to respond to my needs at the first time, whether it was extra towels or travel advice, she was always able to provide the most timely help.

In short, Rosewood Sanya is not only a place to stay, but also a place that makes people feel warm and surprised. Whether it is the hotel's own facilities, environment, or the enthusiastic service of employees such as Annie, I have left an excellent impression on this trip. I will recommend this place to all my friends, and I look forward to returning here again in the near future to relive this beauty.

The environment of the hotel is very beautiful. I like the design of the room, with a bathtub, especially the shower room that runs through the bathroom and the room.

Cleanliness: Very clean. I asked if cleaning was needed at least twice a day. I was also very satisfied with the cleanliness of the room.
Environment: Very beautiful. I stayed in a room with a 180-degree sea view, facing the sea and Wuzhizhou Island. There was no obstruction. It was really beautiful!
Service: Very good, especially Caroline from the guest relations depar**ent. The service is very good and the service attitude is very good! On the first day of check-in, we arrived early and didn't have a room yet. In the afternoon, the children couldn't wait to play in the water in the room, so Caroline found a way to solve the problem, and a room was available soon. One day I went to the beach opposite the hotel and forgot to bring water. I asked her where she could buy drinks. She directly arranged for a colleague from the concierge to deliver water to the beach for us. On the last day we wanted to upgrade to the pool room, and Caroline also helped us apply for a discount. There were many small details and issues, but Caroline handled them very well, making our family very satisfied and happy with our stay.

Environment: The environment is excellent, facing Wuzhizhou Island, the infinity pool & the blue coast add to the island scenery, it is a sea view hotel, exactly like the promotional video 🏨 The room type has a 180-degree sea view from the front, the view and scenery are amazing!
Service: The service is very good, from communication before check-in, to various things to take care of during the stay, to check-out service, the whole process is a butler-style service, enthusiastic but not too attentive, so that guests will not feel disturbed~ Due to the off-season check-in, room upgrades and delayed check-out can meet the needs~ It happened to be my birthday, and the butler specially prepared small cakes and coconut water, the a**osphere was full, thank you for the thoughtful service~
Hygiene: The hotel's indoor and park hygiene is very good, and the room cleaning will also communicate in advance to the right time~
Facilities: The 13th floor infinity pool is really a great place to check in~ There are not many people before 9 o'clock in the morning, and it is comfortable to take pictures~ The lifeguard brothers can also give some small suggestions for posing, they are enthusiastic and cute, and remind you to take water at any time, with a strong sense of service~
Travel photography: This part is specially added. The photographer of the travel photography is very professional and can choose the right place to take pictures according to the guest's status. The post-editing is also of high quality. The 5 free photos will not reduce the level of editing. A few photos were added later. Although the price is a little expensive, it is reasonable~

msg:The Poly Rosewood Hotel in Haitang Bay is very comfortable to stay in. The full sea view room and the infinity sky swimming pool are the biggest highlights of this hotel. The Poly Rosewood Hotel in Sanya is the first resort hotel of the luxury hotel brand of Rosewood Hotels to enter the Chinese mainland. The hotel combines and interprets the long-standing traditional culture of the island with the rapidly developing modern civilization, creating a magnificent holiday a**osphere full of tropical sunshine. The hotel shows the passionate collision of classics and fashion, and the superior quality of both inside and outside. It is one of my favorite hotels. The most important thing is that the overall style of the room is very good, and the scenery outside the window is particularly beautiful. The overall layout of the room is also reasonable. The bed is also very soft and the pillow is very comfortable. The guest relations contacted us in advance and prepared local coconuts that were very delicious. The children also liked it. They were enthusiastic and proactive but not out of proportion. While retaining the sense of boundaries, they ensured that the details were extremely perfect. Give full marks. Come to Rosewood more often in the future. Rosewood = healing. See you next time 👍👍.

The swimming pool upstairs is very beautiful. I may not have seen the swimming pool downstairs because of the off-season.

msg:Sanya luxury hotels, Capella and Rosewood are undoubtedly the twin stars. The rooms and swimming pools are even more magnificent, and the beach and building appearance score Capella points. However, I personally don’t like Capella’s style very much. It’s too bold and lacks new ideas, and its magnificence is always a bit more romantic.
Lying on the bed in the room, you can see a large sea, facing Wuzhizhou Island, and you can watch the sunrise from the room. The internet celebrity swimming pool on the 13th floor is very eye-catching. It should be the best Western restaurant in Sanya. It completely exceeded expectations and is very good👍. The photographer at Manmo Image Travel is also very good.

msg:My family recommended Park Hyatt. When I saw it, I didn’t want to go to Yalong Bay, but decided to stay at Rosewood. I was not disappointed! (cuz of off season??)

Check-in was very smooth. We arrived at around 1 o'clock, 1 hour earlier than expected, and we didn't have to wait too long. We were upgraded to a room and given coconuts for waiting. The whole process was considerate!

The best thing about the room is the view, facing the sea and Hewuzhizhou Island. The second is the bath. The square bath is really better than the round one. The other minibar and bathroom supplies are pretty much the same as other hotels of the same class. I don't think there's anything special about them. However, I feel that one of the shortcomings is that the circulation of the hotel room is full of twists and turns, which makes the originally large room seem less spacious. . I don’t think it has any impact. On the contrary, it makes bathing and other things more private!

It is worth mentioning that the cleaning lady always asks me if I need cleaning every time she sees me. She is always ready to help. Hahahahahahahahahaha cute

I am a person who has a lot of things to do. If anything happens, I will write to Annie on guest relations. The lady will always respond to my requests, hinNice!

If you love taking pictures, you probably won’t be able to move your legs. You can also be in a daze for a few hours in peace and quiet. The facilities in the rooms and the public areas of the main building are still well maintained. The garden area near the beach needs to enhance the sense of age. Anyway, the hotel I went to didn’t have many guests, so I just stepped on the sand. You can enjoy the night view of Haichang in the corridor at night. The biggest surprise of my stay this time was meeting the considerate housekeeper Ella, who communicated in every detail and solved the problem quickly and well. Most of my high star rating is because of the housekeeper. It is very important to have good butlers in these five-star hotels in Sanya. Full of emotional value!

The service didn't answer my questions directly and left. I wonder if this hotel is the service of Rosewood Hotel? It was contracted by a third party. I originally booked a hotel for two nights, but decided to check out and change hotels.

msg:Rosewood is the most pet-friendly hotel in Sanya. Pets can truly stay with you. Outdoor seating is accepted for breakfast, and dogs are accepted at the pool and sky bar. The premise is that you can't go into the water. Although the cleaning fee is a bit expensive, the kennels and food bowls provided are very clean.

msg:@@I chose the 180 sea view suite for this stay. Originally, there were only three suites of this room in the entire hotel. It is said that the one arranged for us was the largest one on the 12th floor. However, the indoor swimming pool was too far away from the room, so we moved to the 6th and 12th floor, which has a larger overall room area. Butler Very nice, they made us an extra bed for free and gave us two extra breakfasts! The overall experience of staying with family and children was good. This hotel is not magnificent throughout. If you want a luxurious lobby, it may not be able to give it to you. However, I think the view of the sea from the room and the combination of the swimming pool in the room are good. The breakfast is also good.

From the greeting boy in Datang, Xiao Zhao who cleans the room, Xiao Tan who contacts the concierge, and the service staff in the restaurant, they are all like family members, meticulous, thoughtful and attentive. Affection! It made me look brand new, both externally and internally, during the few days when I was extremely tired and rushed to the magnificent Poly. The travel photographer provided by the hotel is of high standard and the beautiful moments are captured in the best time of life. Thank you for meeting me and will come again! &&

The various supporting facilities in the room are very complete, the layout is also very reasonable, the sanitary conditions are also very good, and the service attitude of the staff is also good. In addition, Rosewood is a pet-friendly hotel, I think it is a real gem. Well deserved. But I hope that the hotel can be more detailed in its work. I called the staff several times to ask the staff on duty at night. They said that dogs are not allowed in the restaurant, but in fact, dogs are allowed in all restaurants, so Maybe the connection is a little careless. Everything else is quite good. I stayed there for five nights from 2.1 to 2.5, then six nights on 2.6, and then eight nights from 2.7 to 2.9. It was really good, otherwise I wouldn’t have stayed there all the time. Continue to stay, right haha😄

msg:For our second stop in Sanya, we chose Poly Rosewood Hotel. It is indeed a designer hotel. The entire hotel has a very strong sense of design. The sky lobby experience is completely different from the traditional resort hotel experience. The scenery on 14F is amazing. When you arrive at the hotel, It was evening and I happened to see the Ferris wheel in Haichang Plaza🎡With the DJ music in the lobby, the experience was very interesting😁
Service: In terms of service_ _the housekeeper contacted us from the day before check-in and took the initiative to help us upgrade to the supreme sea view. The view from higher floors is indeed much better! Because we arrived late that day, _ _ also took the initiative to ask us if we would like to help make reservations for meals, so as to avoid being hungry and having to wait in line for meals. If we need anything during our stay, we only need to tell her, and she can quickly help arrange it. The experience was good. I will come back next time I go on vacation.
Environment: The hotel has a rich green landscape. In addition to the main building, the hotel also has a villa area, so the experience of walking to the beach is very interesting. Walking through the garden, main swimming pool, children's pool, main lawn, the landscape is rich in layers, and the beach is Haitang Bay. It is a public beach. To be honest, the fineness of the beach is still different from that of Clearwater Bay. Moreover, various activities to attract tourists are full of ruts and horseshoe prints... I hope Haitang Bay can be optimized.
Facilities: When you come to Hainan with your kids, you can play in all kinds of water. There are two swimming pools here, the main swimming pool on the first floor and the sky swimming pool on the 13th floor. The experience is completely different. The main swimming pool is relatively cold in winter, and the sky swimming pool on the 13th floor is. The one with a constant temperature is much better. There is sunscreen beside the swimming pool that you can reapply. This experience is very good. A friendly reminder that the swimming pool on the 13th floor can only use arm rings, not swimming rings🛟, and swimming rings are not allowed🛟
Daily free minibar and snacks: This is a good point

It fits the magnificent style and feels good. It is very comfortable to drink tea and read in the room.

The service is remarkable. The butler provides one-to-one WeChat service. He is friendly and service-minded. He will give detailed explanations to the guest room after registration, and the WeChat online reply will be timely. Including three days after leaving the hotel, I encountered China Duty Free. When I have questions about online shopping and ordering in the store, I always think of asking her immediately (even though I have several butlers on WeChat who stayed in the hotel along the way), ## helps me answer questions carefully and provide help ~ This is what a butler should do. He is also a good and qualified housekeeper; the profession of housekeeper requires seriousness, attentiveness and talent.

On the day of check-in, we were upgraded to a supreme 180-degree sea view room on the 10th floor for free, with a large balcony, a super wide view, and an unparalleled 180-degree sea view! The brand-name extra large bathtub can open the window and face the sea directly! There is also a super romantic honeymoon room decoration! The hotel environment is very good: the large open-air swimming pool on the first floor is free for paddle boards, the open-air bar and infinity pool on the 13th floor are really outstanding, and the constant-temperature swimming pool this season is also unexpected... It is only a 300-meter walk to the Coconut Grove Lawn and To the seaside, the hotel provides a free round-trip shuttle bus. 1The daily breakfast faces the sea, fresh and rich! What’s particularly surprising is that the exclusive service is super great! The hotel's guest relations staff will greet your needs every day during your stay. If you have any feedback, you can respond promptly. They are very thoughtful and considerate! My wife and I both want to stay here more. We will definitely choose a magnificent hotel next time.

The day before checking into the hotel, the hotel GR-Ai Leen added me on WeChat and learned more about my needs. After arriving at the hotel, she enthusiastically upgraded and arranged the rooms for me and my parents together so that I could take care of them. She took the trouble to express her condolences every morning about my sleep status and needs last night ~ when I said that the bed was too soft and I couldn't sleep well. , she communicated with the waiter in time and helped me add a hard mattress. I finally slept comfortably in the next two days...🌊The beauty of life does not lie in the end, but in the process. 🌊Thank you again Ai Leen🌷
Since I am not in very good health and my parents are old, we almost all ate at the hotel for a few days. The fisherman's house we visited most often was warm and comfortable, and the food tasted good. The waitresses were very simple and kind, which left a deep impression on us. Besides, the morning buffet has a wide variety and the ingredients are fresh. Every day you can always see a tall male chef with a pigtail (probably the head chef) constantly telling the little chef where the side dishes are needed...what kind of service does the guest need? Guanliu Road, with such a leader, you are not afraid of the quality and service of the restaurant chefs👍
The trip of just a few days is over🌼I use my time and heart to see people, not my eyes🌼Thank you again to the service staff of Rosewood Hotel🌷🌷🌷

The overall feeling of Sanya when I stayed this time was not that good, especially the decoration was very rough, like the bathroom below, but maybe it's because of the island.

It is very suitable for friends who come to vacation and seek leisure. The stay was a little unpleasant at first, but then the housekeeper:: fixed it for us. Thanks 🙏. I was very satisfied with my stay for the next three days. This time I met many owners with dogs and had a great time. The executive lounge is very beautiful, and most of the Internet celebrities take photos there. It is recommended that everyone go take photos and swim. So beautiful.
The various special eggs for breakfast are also very delicious and worth a try for breakfast.

The point is that the butler is great. I proactively asked if I had any needs during my stay one day in advance, arranged the room, presented cakes and champagne, and helped book a restaurant for the New Year’s Eve night. My greetings every day were very considerate. When I checked in, the room was not cleaned in time because the room was not cleaned in time. The unpleasantness caused by being able to check in in time was relieved. The drone show in the hotel in the evening was also very innovative and had a strong New Year's Eve feeling. .

The infinity pool on the 13th floor faces the sea and feels great. It is a constant-temperature pool. Now in Sanya, this pool is quite cold at night. It's great. It's very comfortable to have a drink with the sea breeze at night. The breakfast is very rich. The hotel is not far from the beach. The waves are big and the water is blue ~ ## The hotel service is excellent. Every post will ask questions every day. If you have any questions, they will respond actively. I was given a New Year’s Eve cake (I took it away without eating it) and a thumbs up for the coconut 👍 The hotel has a public spa area where you can soak in hot water and a dry and wet sauna, which is suitable for today’s Sanya. All in all, it was a great stay experience and worth coming back. ##

He added his contact information one day in advance and checked in smoothly on the same day. He always took the initiative to care about our travel experience and provided travel suggestions, which made our trip to Sanya even better. Feel safe and comfortable as home. The room design is low-key but elegant, with full details. The color of the room is soft and high-end, and the layout is reasonable. The whole wood color is dotted with haze blue, which should be the conceptual color of the hotel brand. I like it very much. It looks very peaceful. As soon as you enter the room, BGM and Willowrich's special woody rose fragrance perfectly combine softness and luxury. Coupled with the 180-degree panoramic sea view, the drizzle in Sanya at the end of October is set off with a unique charm.

msg:Finally stayed at Rosewood Sanya! The mixed reviews on the Internet made me a little hesitant, but in reality it was very comfortable to live in. As expected, I still can’t believe it through hearsay hahaha
We booked a sea view room, and our luggage was sent directly to the front desk. The room size is okay, and the view is very good. Opposite is Wuzhizhou Island. I like to watch the sea from the balcony sofa. Because it is a honeymoon trip, you can also ask the hotel to decorate it. Next, there's a rose bath

Facilities: quite complete, including electric curtains, bathtubs, cloakrooms and disposable supplies.
Hygiene: Rosewood uses a relatively well-known linen brand. The bedding is very comfortable. Pajamas are also provided. Disposable slippers are famously comfortable and soft.
Service: Similar to butler service, you can tell the butler if you have any requests. Ms. Lynn is very gentle and provides excellent service. She also helped me apply for extra bags. Hahaha, I love it.
   That is to say, the doorman service at this door is a bit different. Some will open the door for you, some will take the initiative to help you with your luggage, and some will not be able to do it. It seems that they have not seen it. They did not even help us put our luggage when we left. I put it in the car myself
Breakfast: They say that Rosewood's breakfast is very delicious, and it certainly lives up to its reputation. The portions that can be ordered are different every day, and the order is very fast. The categories are not completely repeated on two days, and the desserts are very good! I love it so much, the materials used are exquisite! The portions of cold dishes and hot dishes are small but concise, and they are really delicious.
Environment: The infinity swimming pool is a selling point. I went there to take photos and it was pretty good.
Anyway, I’ll come back next time!

The day before check-in, guest service Lynn took the initiative to contact
Inform the hotel of related projects in advance and pay attention to other demands in advance
Although it took some time to wait for the room on the day of check-in
But it doesn't affect the experience
Special emphasis to those staying here, don't waste waiting time
Go down to the 13th floor, the scenery there is really beautiful
Looking at Wuzhizhou Island, you can also order special drinks or cocktails
It's not a problem to stay here for a few hours
In the evening, the infinity pool on the 13th floor of the hotel is also very comfortable
There are not too many people, not noisy, and you will not be disturbed after swimming a few times
The breakfast on the second day is not rich in varieties, but there are some plates that should be there
Let's see how you match your breakfast combination
overall is good
But I also hope to continue to improve the deficiencies

At the same time, the service is also very enthusiastic and almost always responds to the guests' requests. The lighting in the room is good and the sanitation is also very good. The toiletries are all from good brands, and there are even dry and wet separations. It's a very nice stay.

The whole service was attentive and online, including every service staff in the breakfast room and fisherman's restaurant. The road leading from the hotel to the beach is also very quiet. The beach is also very clean and comfortable with few people. The main lawn on the road is also well maintained. The best experience this time is that the hotel staff are really attentive to welcoming dogs. They give away toys, provide nests and dining basins. I really feel that if I go to Sanya again, I will still choose Poly Rosewood. I hope the hotel facilities can be maintained for a long time. It’s new, and it will bring surprises next time you go.

msg:It is really a journey of metaphysics...I stayed here from Saturday to Sunday. I originally wanted to stay alone for one night and spend my birthday watching the sea and introspecting. As a result, he fell directly and broke his bones. I came back for a week and no one asked me about it...it was so indifferent that it didn't feel like a luxury hotel at all.

The hotel is just as beautiful as the picture. During the rainy season in Sanya, the sky is clear in the morning and stormy in the afternoon. I only have one weekend and I won’t be able to go out, so I booked a swimming pool room (the pool water in the room is not very clean, but I can’t force it if the weather is bad). The manager was very nice and helped to upgrade the room and decorate it. The small cakes he sent were very delicious. This package from Ctrip is also good. There are not many things at sunset but the fruit is quite fresh. The sauna is very good and the breakfast is also good. Morning yoga is recommended. The scenery is very beautiful. There are not many people and there is a late check-out. Well done.

However, there are many safety hazards in this hotel. There are no anti-slip mats next to the swimming pool in the room, and there are no bath towels outside. If you are not prepared to step on the water and slip out, this can be avoided. The problem is that internet celebrity staircase. The first day went fine, but the second day the first time I went there, I lost my footing and fell down from the penultimate section. I didn’t feel much pain at the time, so I forgot about it. As a result, the second time I was traveling and shooting, the guy brought me here. Five Minutes ago, I was saying that I fell down here last time, and then I just walked again. This time, I stepped on nothing again...
This time it was a standard sprained foot. It was so painful that I was shaking. But at the time, because I felt it was my responsibility and I had to catch a flight at night, I didn’t go directly to the hospital... I regret it very much now...
1. The only first aid provided in the hotel is Yunnan Baiyao aerosol. It should be untrained first aid personnel. You have to ask for ice.
2. There are wheelchairs, but I don’t know if hotel travel photography counts as a hotel person. Only this guy accompanied me...
3. The most ridiculous thing is that it hurt so much after the fall. I sat on the edge of the stairs and watched helplessly as a girl who was probably no more than 10 years old used exactly the same method as me and stepped on both legs and fell down. The girl got up a bit like I had fallen down for the first time. She felt that there was no big problem and left with her mother.

Metaphysics thought this was a bit ridiculous, but it was too painful and embarrassing at the time, so I didn't look to see if it was because of water or if there was something dirty. Later I thought that there might be something wrong with the design of the hotel’s spiral staircase, but the main reason was that the swelling was already very high at the time. I was in a hurry to buy medicine and bandages for ice application. The travel photographer also chatted with me to distract me, so I didn’t even think of pursuing it. The hotel's responsibility.

Then the development direction of this story became very cold... I applied to sit in the lounge until I went to the airport, but no one ignored me without asking. I couldn't walk after I fell like this. I asked about the airport drop-off, and I had to go to the front desk myself for 600 yuan. ￼Pay. Later, the account manager saw that I was miserable and brought the POS machine over... The good thing is that the big brother who sent me to the airport was really responsible and pushed me all the way to the airport... But it has been a week and there is no one behind me, even if I ask a question. Didn’t you come back alive😅🥲 Are you afraid that I would complain again if I remembered? After I came back, I went to the hospital and was diagnosed with an avulsion fracture of the lateral malleolus and a fracture of the talus, which had to be immobilized for at least one and a half months. It was really a great gift on the first day of a new year.

I feel very regretful when I think about it. There are so many luxury hotels in Sanya, but I feel that there are very few people who are so indifferent to a guest who fell down in the hotel. Being an overly introspective traveler who doesn't act or scold you really doesn't deserve a word of humanistic care. Maybe their definition of service varies from person to person? If you only want the view but no service, then there is no need to choose this one.

1. I was very satisfied with the breakfast at the hotel. The dining place was the East Kitchen Restaurant on the 13th floor. There was an infinity pool right outside the window. The scenery I faced every morning was incomparably beautiful and made me feel very good.
2. The hotel has a dedicated butler service. Any needs raised by the butler will be arranged as soon as possible, such as helping to reserve the hotel’s free experience projects and various facilities, booking tickets, etc. Our butler Tony’s service is very good and makes people feel at home. . Helped us upgrade to a 180° sea view room. The location of the room we chose is indeed the best.
3. This time I tried two restaurants in the hotel, one is Yujia and the other is Zhi. Both are very delicious. I ate dregs and vinegar hot pot at the fisherman's house, and ate Western food in Zhi. The a**osphere, environment and taste are all excellent.
4. There are actually quite a lot of activities that you can do in the hotel. The free travel photos were very impressive, and I bought many more photos later. We are two people who don't know how to take pictures, and the photographer can give us enough to post on WeChat Moments.
The overall experience this time is really great. Once you move in, you can feel that it is actually very cost-effective! Although the cost is relatively high, the experience is indeed much better than other hotels!

msg:In the years before the epidemic, I would choose Rosewood every year. I originally planned to stay at Capella for this trip, but as a regular customer of Rosewood, I still had no hesitation and took my partner to stay at Rosewood. Overall evaluation: I haven’t been there for two years. First of all, let me say that the room service is very nice. There is no doubt about it. From check-in to the romantic flower arrangement in the room, I have to thank you for everything🙏. The surrounding facilities from the hotel to the seaside are also great. Improved a lot. Disadvantages: 1. Because I spent a lot of time out playing, the air conditioner was still not cooling when I returned to the hotel. I called the master in the early hours of the night to repair it. It was indeed better that night. The same problem occurred again the next day, the temperature It has been adjusted to the lowest setting, and I still sweat when wearing shorts and short sleeves. I have encountered the same problem in other hotels before, and the solution given is to fix it or ask if I can change rooms. 2. The second one is the service guy at the infinity open-air swimming pool. I don’t know if the service training is not in place, because it was raining lightly that day, and I didn’t want to go out to play. I just wanted to have a look at the swimming pool. The rain was very light, brother. He said very coldly that he couldn't swim on rainy days, but he was very cold anyway. Can we be a little more flexible and inform the guests that swimming is temporarily not allowed on rainy days for safety reasons? So my partner and I went swimming on the first floor. There were too many mosquitoes downstairs. We didn’t play for a few minutes before we went up to the 13th floor. Anyway, not long ago, there were already people swimming in the pool next to us. 3. The third problem should be more serious. On the first day I checked in, a waiter was breaking off the explosion-proof film, and some fragments hit my eyes. Because of the contact lenses I was wearing, I specifically told him to be careful. A little bit, and it almost stuck into my eye, but nothing happened after that. In short, overall this stay is not as good as before. As a loyal customer of Poly, I still hope you will do better and better. After all, I still like the skyline swimming pool very much.

msg:I am very satisfied with my stay! Hotel staff Ai Leen contacted me one day in advance and helped me upgrade the room. If you have any small questions, you can always consult Ai Leen. Before check-out on the last day, she also came to ask if you needed help. It was really helpful. intimate. Stayed here for two days in a row. From the moment I arrived at the hotel, I felt full of enthusiasm. The concierge service on the first floor was very attentive. We checked in at the lobby on the 14th floor. The guy who received us was also super nice! The hotel gave us a gift Coconut water and snacks are provided at night when you turn down the bed. The skyline swimming pool on the 13th floor has a very good view. It is great for swimming and taking photos or drinking and relaxing. There is a beach below the hotel. Although you cannot go into the water, it is very comfortable to walk along the beach. To go to the duty-free shop, you can take the hotel's free shuttle bus at 10 o'clock. It will arrive in about ten minutes, which is very convenient! It's a pity that I couldn't get up at 7 o'clock to participate in the yoga class this time. I hope to come again next time!

Service: Lynn from the Guest Relations Depar**ent starts providing information services before check-in. She is thoughtful, considerate, and warm. The mood of the trip is not affected by thunderstorms, making it even more enjoyable. Stay in a five-star hotel and enjoy six-star service. Give Lynn six stars manually. 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
Others: Super rich Mini bar, in-room seafood tomato pasta, I love the taste.
The nightly coconut snacks provided in the room are very nice and delicious.

msg:It was a trip with perfect experience. I traveled in off-peak hours in September after the summer vacation. The hotel prices have come down, but the service quality is still online.
Thanks to the housekeeper, Elissa, for her warm hospitality. I contacted you in advance and helped to upgrade the 180-degree sea view room. During my stay, I kept in touch with you if there was any need (although I was so excited that I often forgot to reply).
The breakfast at BTW Hotel is rich in variety and tastes good. A rare breakfast is salmon and tuna sashimi.
The hotel is not far from the beach, and there are battery cars to sit on. Although the beach is a public beach (there is no private beach in Haitang Bay, all are public), there are few people, the water is clear and the sand is fine, and it is on the east side. You can watch the sunrise in the morning. There is also sunset at night, which is beautiful.
The hotel decoration is high-end and modern, and photos taken by the infinity pool can be taken in minutes.

msg:Facilities: The hardware facilities are very complete and very good. The overall hotel style and environment are in line with the level of a five-star luxury resort hotel. The only drawback is that the swimming changing room is too small, the ventilation is average, and the electronic lock is not very sensitive.
Environment: The overall a**osphere is very pleasant and relaxing. There are relatively few people on the beach. However, the Haitang Bay area has relatively strong wind and waves, so it is not suitable for going to the sea.
Hygiene: Hygiene is very good in both public areas and rooms. I am also very satisfied with the frequency of changing bath towels.
Service: The service is the most remarkable thing about the entire hotel. First of all, thank you to the housekeeper Elisa. She contacted me one day in advance to ask if I needed help or personal preferences. She also recommended beautiful scenic spots in Sanya to my husband and me, etc. , The butler service is really one-stop, which is great. I also like the turndown service very much. It's very considerate and makes me feel like I'm being cared for. When I come to Sanya again, I will still choose Rosewood Poly Hotel!

msg:Taking our children to the Rosewood Hotel was our last stop. This trip to Sanya was mainly about hotel stays. We came to Rosewood after checking out from Yate. Guest relations Tony contacted us one day in advance and arranged a very good room. The hotel decoration is calm. It's grand, especially the indoor layout is unique. You can enjoy the sea view while lying on the bed, facing Wuzhizhou Island. There is a large bathtub by the window indoors. The hotel provides free morning yoga. There is only one pick-up and drop-off from the duty-free shop (delivery at 10 am) , picked up at 3 p.m.) You need to book one day in advance. You can experience windsurfing for free in the outdoor swimming pool on the first floor. It’s a pity that we didn’t get to play it because we didn’t book it 24 hours in advance. The infinity pool on the 13th floor is a good place to take pictures. The breakfast content is different from other hotels. It’s not much, but it’s expensive because of its exquisiteness. I prefer the wontons here. In short, after staying for two nights, I feel that Rosewood Hotel should differentiate between Yate and organize activities for older children. Improving the price/performance ratio will attract more people.

msg:Temporarily because of my ankle, the summer vacation trip to Guizhou planned early was changed to "Barefoot Daxian Hainan East Line Self-Driving". A trip that just said and walked started from Haikou, and the final destination 🏁 finally chose Sanya, which is said to be Haitang. The most beautiful hotel in the bay, Lynn, the hotel housekeeper, confirmed the relevant check-in details with me early on. The key point is that we also upgraded our family to a 180-degree sea view room for free, which immediately increased my anticipation for staying in this hotel for the first time. Because I chose the Ctrip group buying package, I don’t want to show off a lot of benefits for eating, drinking, and taking photos. The core is still to praise the hotel's various five-star nanny-level services that make you feel at home. Because my shoe size is 43, the slippers in the room are too small + I have turned my feet before. At this moment, it is extremely important to not have a pair of slippers that fit my feet. Then I asked the housekeeper Lynn on WeChat late at night, and immediately returned to the room after breakfast the next day to receive a perfect pair. The trendy men’s slippers that fit my feet immediately made my Sanya slippers free.
Finally, let’s summarize the hotel’s features: 1. The best location for travel photography. The hotel has its own travel photography agency. There are 5 photos in our package; 2. The late-night BGM in the bar on the 13th floor is very impressive 3. The breakfast is also very delicious ( It is more suitable for our guests who like western food and coffee culture. The key is that the local Xinglong earbags in Hainan can be used for free every day, 6 Nestle capsules per day in the room, and the baked desserts are especially excellent) 4. The butler service is very considerate, in addition to helping you arrange Check-in and check-out hotel time, but also become a worry-free little helper for all kinds of travel.
For those who like to stay in hotels in Sanya, we pay the most attention to service. Although we have not experienced other hotels in Sanya, compared with hotels of the same level in other cities before, Rosewood will become one of the first choice hotels for our family in the future. 👍👍👍

Later, Ctrip’s customer service lady helped to deal with it. However, I have to complain that the hotel’s sales depar**ent is not very user-friendly. Give a thumbs up to the customer service lady who helped me deal with the problem. I arrived at the hotel early and had to wait for more than two hours before entering the room. The butler Tony's service was very good. Many problems were solved quickly. The breakfast varieties were okay. Overall, the environment and facilities were good. I will come again next time.

You are not asked to pay for breakfast separately. The breakfast is rich and the environment is great.

The gentle lady who checked in in the lobby helped to upgrade the room for free, with a 180-degree sea view, opening the curtains every day, facing the sea, and instantly starting the day with a good mood!
After putting down our luggage, we went to check in the infinity pool. It is really an invincible sea view, the water and the sky are the same color, and it is beautiful to sit in a daze on the deck chair.
The housekeeper, Ai Leen, was warm, thoughtful and meticulous. The only problem he responded was "the room smelled a bit strange". He immediately sent the room manager to check and sent a purifier to improve it a lot. The speed at which this problem is solved has to be greatly praised!

In the sea restaurant on the 13th floor, it’s so refreshing to have a drink and watch the sunset over the sea. It's a pity this time that the plane was late and the delay was serious, and we didn't check in until three in the morning, so we didn't live enough. I will come again next time, thank you Elisa again.

Meals: The buffet breakfast (in Dongchu restaurant) can be said to be one of the most outstanding five-star hotels I have stayed in. There are not many types but all of them are very delicious. I highly recommend handmade ice cream and Spanish churros. We also ate lunch at Dongchu restaurant, Southeast Asian style, curry shrimp and Hainanese chicken rice are really delicious, but the price is a little expensive, 300-450 per capita

Overall, it was a very good stay experience, much better than Atlantis and Mandarin Oriental, I will definitely stay again next time I go to Sanya 😁

The five-sided swimming pool on the 13th floor of the hotel is so beautiful. It is the most beautiful sea view I have ever seen in Sanya. There is also a constant temperature pool, so you can go into the water even in this weather. In addition, the hotel is very close to the beach, just a few minutes away. ##I especially want to praise the hotel's excellent service. The guest relations officer contacted me to arrange the room before I checked in. Respond to me promptly if necessary. Extremely thoughtful. Next time I come to Sanya, I will continue to stay at Poly Rosewood. Good deal

msg:I went there with high hopes for Poly Rosewood. I went there and found out that the internet celebrity hotel was indeed an internet celebrity, but it was just fake! When I first walked into the room, the first thing I felt was that it was dirty, on the sofa, on the chairs, on the carpet, even on the carpet. The books for guests to read are covered in all kinds of indescribable stains! Then the boardwalk to the beach was in tatters, and every step I took I was worried about stepping on a rotten board and scratching my feet. The beach and lawns were crowded and messy with local people. Went to the beach. The scenery was nice during the day, but the sun was too hot, all kinds of clothes were exposed, people were posing and taking pictures, and there were not many people swimming! In the evening I wanted to go have a drink and catch some fresh air, but the waiter was dumb and the music was monotonous and noisy which made me lose all my interest! The dinner at the Fisherman's House was okay, but the dinner at Dongchu was a disaster. One serving of mango sticky rice was unpalatable, and it also caused diarrhea in the family, which affected the rest of the trip. I asked the hotel if there was any medicine for urgent use. They told us to buy the medicine ourselves or go to the hospital and ignored them. The breakfast was average. It was the first time I saw someone bringing a dog for breakfast. The breakfast tableware was not washed yet! It was extremely hot on the balcony. There was no breeze from morning to night. The bed was so soft that my back hurt when I slept on it. None of the chairs in the room were comfortable. The room was small and crowded. Even the clothes were hung on the clothes drying rack. Wonderful designs on the ground! All in all, there is nothing comfortable about this dirty hotel, and the unclean food caused diarrhea! Very not suitable for family travel! Choose carefully! ! !

Next, let’s talk about the check-in experience. When we get off the bus, the hotel staff will arrange to pick up the luggage. After checking in at the front desk of the hotel with a brand, we will be sent directly to the room. We checked in at 12:00 noon, and the front desk upgraded us to a 180-degree sea view room. But the guest room still needs to be checked again, so we went to the 13th floor for lunch. I forgot the name of that Southeast Asian restaurant. The food is delicious but the serving is a bit slow. After eating, I went directly to 913. Room 13 is the middle of the whole building, and the view is very beautiful. During the stay, the room always maintained a faint fragrance, the replacement items were replaced in a timely manner, and the bed was turned down at night, which is really great. In the evening, I went to the bar on the 13th floor to drink and eat snacks, fried chicken and cocktails. They were all good, and they looked cute. It is recommended to buy a group purchase. I found out the next day. Of course, guests who stay can get a discount. In the afternoon, I went to the swimming pool on the 13th floor. The swimming pool on the first floor is also very good. The 13th floor is more suitable for taking pictures. There is also a shuttle bus on the 1st floor to the swimming pool and the beach, and it is very convenient to call a car when you come back. The breakfast is also delicious, with many varieties, and the free a la carte Xiaolongbao is also delicious. In fact, I read Xiaohongshu before I went. There are so many magnificent black poly books. I was a little apprehensive before checking in. I didn’t expect that the service from the staff to the hotel’s facilities were perfect during the stay. Good or bad, you can really experience it by living alone! Very recommended hotel, will come again next time!

      The hotel's infinity pool is full of stylish a**osphere. The breakfast room is on the same floor, where you can dine while enjoying the sea view.
     All the service staff are very warm and considerate, especially thanks to the housekeeper, Ms. Shelly, for her thoughtful arrangements ❤️ After knowing that I was sick and went to the hospital to hang water, I specially took care of the late check-out, allowing me to have plenty of time to rest and pack my luggage.

msg:In particular, the bathtub is made of frosted surface and the water is silent. Boss Zheng has put his heart into it and has a good taste in life. The room is full of high-end details with a touch of cuteness. I like this hotel very much. You can walk to the beach from the first floor. There are not many people in our off-season.
Take 1 hour at the hotel and give 5 photos: The photographer is very good, and he didn't try hard to sell his products
Tropical seasonal fresh fruits and sweet Wenchang young coconut: I mainly use the young coconut for photography, it’s super pretty
Daily free mini bar and snacks: it is quite rich, coffee, Coke Sprite, beer are all available
Disadvantages: The little bartender girl on the 13th floor is seriously out of tune with the cultural and fashion style of this hotel. It really loses points, and she doesn’t match up with the DJ behind. Can... more and more angry

msg:The sea view in the room is pretty good, facing Wuzhizhou Island. The hotel butler service is also very good. They contacted me in advance and upgraded my room. On a family trip, we stayed at the Rosewood Hotel because our children wanted to take pictures at the terrace and swimming pool. After checking in, we immediately made a reservation for afternoon tea in advance according to the front desk instructions. What was unacceptable was that we paid 888 yuan for the afternoon tea for three people before we were seated. When we sat down, there was a security guard who didn't allow us to take photos with a SLR camera. Without any prior notification or any publicity, I couldn't accept it. It was ridiculous... I wanted to report it to 110 at that time, but I didn't know where I went wrong. ? What does this mean? Later, a staff member came to explain and deal with it, which greatly affected our mood during this stay. The management is terrible, unreasonable and annoying. I spent money to buy this place. I will not go there again.

msg:For this vacation, I chose Poly Rosewood among the many hotels in Haitang Bay. At first, it was due to its sky double-sided infinity pool and sky bar. My husband and I didn’t bring our children on this trip, so we just wanted to relax and take a vacation. Thank you very much to the housekeeper, Elissa Yao Jianing, who specially arranged for us a 180-degree luxury sea view room with a double bed facing the sea. The perfect room type and location made me welcome When you open the curtains, you can see the invincible sea view of Haitang Bay and Wuzhizhou Island in the distance, which is a beautiful painting. Elissa specially helped to arrange a complimentary fruit plate and a romantic evening drink the day before check-out, making the 8-day vacation perfect. The sky bar is very worth experiencing, and the real infinity pool works great. There are landscapes everywhere in the hotel, sisters who like to take pictures, bring your camera and husband ~ fully enjoy your charm blooming moment ~ By the way, the hotel's catering, remember to make reservations for the restaurant in advance, from the environment to the service to the dishes All very worth experiencing. The East Kitchen on the 14th floor satisfied the two of us who didn't really like Southeast Asian cuisine. In short, I highly recommend it to friends who come to Haitang Bay to enjoy pure vacation time. It will allow you and your partner to stay in the hotel all day long without getting tired. I would also like to thank the housekeeper Elissa for helping us arrange it after learning that our return flight was delayed. The late checkout made it very easy for us to get through the delay caused by the flight delay at the hotel. Looking forward to the next stay~~

msg:The second stay is Rosewood, the room is very comfortable, thank you very much for shelly's care during the stay, I contacted and added WeChat in advance, let me feel the meticulous service before check-in, and will answer any questions carefully. The room arrangement is very satisfactory, the view of the hotel is very beautiful, and the infinity pool on the 13th floor is great. The magnificent bed is super soft, so if you like a hard bed, please tell the front desk in advance that it can be replaced. As a foodie, Magnificent Food Control is a hotel that I like very much after visiting Sanya five times. After comparing Tianfang InterContinental, Banshan Peninsula InterContinental, and Yate, I still think that I prefer magnificent meals. Last month, I had breakfast at the fisherman's house on the first floor. This time at the East Kitchen on the 13th floor, the place where the food is placed is a bit smaller and a little cramped, but the variety of food is still rich. Because I came to bring children this time, I personally feel that the beach in Xiaodonghai has many corals and is hard to walk on. There are reefs suitable for catching up with the sea, but because the children are 3 years old, they prefer to dig sand. And you can bring a flashlight to dig sand crabs at night, the children love it so much, and will choose Magnificent next time.

Hygiene: The sanitation is very careful, and the supply is also timely. The gifts in the room (Coke, Sprite, Hainan beer, and biscuits, peanuts are all free, and will be replenished every day), especially the beer is great, facing the sea view , blowing the sea breeze, drinking a small beer, so cozy.

Facilities: The infinity pool on the 13th floor is beautiful. It is a good place to produce movies. In addition, the gym facilities are also very complete and open 24 hours. The only downside is that the breakfast is so-so.

Service: From check-in to check-out, the service attitude and quality of the service staff are very online. I must like it. During the period, there was a small problem with the air conditioner in the room. The engineer Fu came to check and repair the first time, and made a backup plan for replacing the new room. Here, I would like to thank the housekeeper Lynn for her service and help throughout the whole process. I feel that I have met a new friend during the trip, and this friend is so caring, patient and reliable, and I must give it a thumbs up.

msg:I haven't been anywhere in the past three years due to the epidemic. I really want to travel like crazy. After the epidemic, in order to be busy with the business of the store, I have not moved my nest 🥹After May 1st, I staggered the peak period, and finally decided to go for a walk on the beach temporarily. Choosing a hotel is my strong point. I think that I must choose a comfortable one for vacation.
Now I rely too much on Xiaohongshu, it is my encyclopedia 🤣 I chose Poly Rosewood decisively, please see the key points below~
	
advantage:
1. The hotel is located in Haitang Bay, Sanya. Although it is far away from the noisy area, it is really suitable for leisure and vacation. Those who like to stay in hotels can choose the location of Haitang Bay!
2. The Sanya cdf duty-free shop is located in Haitang Bay. The surrounding hotels are very close to the duty-free shop by car. Rosewood Poly is 10 minutes away by car from the duty-free shop.
3. The service of this hotel is superb. I booked it in advance on Ctrip. About a day before departure, the personal butler of the hotel’s guest relations will call you and add you on WeChat. Things are all rounded up! The butler of the wrong peak travel will also upgrade the room for you! This time, we were upgraded to a 180-degree sea view room, and the location is super frontal, facing Wuzhizhou Island, and the higher the floor, the better the view!
4. There are three restaurants in this hotel. We went to the Southeast Asian restaurant on the 13th floor on the first day we arrived. This restaurant is also used for breakfast here. There are also two infinity pools on the 13th floor. I personally think that taking pictures when the sun sets in the afternoon is the best! The water bar in the middle of the pool, remember to order passion fruit and lychee-flavored non-alcoholic drinks, which are super delicious! The remaining two are on the first floor of the hotel. One eats dross vinegar hot pot and grilled seafood. I didn’t try dross vinegar because I think "Taiqiong Hundred Years Dross Vinegar Seafood Hot Pot" is the best. It takes 15 minutes to drive there. In Haitang Bay. I had some kebabs and grilled scallops at the hotel's barbecue, which was not bad, and the rose iced tea that the waiter made for me was also super delicious! The last restaurant serves western food. I personally think that only the pre-dinner bread is delicious, but the environment is super romantic. I told the restaurant in advance on the anniversary that they will arrange balloons for you🎈.
5. The furnishings in the room are new. In fact, the hotel is old, but it is well maintained. Sparkling wine, coconuts, and fruits will be given away on the day of check-in. I will give you a small dessert the next day, I feel very caring, and the hotel housekeeper will personally write a postcard for you, which is really nice and considerate♥️～
	
Slightly deficient:
1. The location of the hotel is actually quite big, and there are many trees, resulting in a lot of fallen leaves. Some are in the swimming pool, and some are beside the road. It really feels very unclean. I lived in a hotel before, and it was not clean. There are staff cleaning regularly every day. It would be really nice if the environment could be maintained better.
	
Family outing:
1. There are not many people going to this place after the peak period. It is also an excellent choice if you bring children. I think the room also provides a baby bed, which is really pretty good.
	
Car rental business:
We made an appoin**ent in advance to rent a car in China. If you are in Hainan for about a week, it is recommended to rent a car, which is very convenient!

Special thanks to:
Lynn cc Chen Qingzhen from Sanya Poly Magnificent Guest Relations, thank you very much, thank you for taking care of me these two days. I will come to you next time! 💕💕💕💕💕

msg:Hotel environment: It can be regarded as the top five hotels in Haitang Bay. The overall room is ins style, suitable for taking pictures and checking in. The room is clean and bright, the balcony is also great, and the view is good. The front desk even upgraded the floor. The environment below the hotel is also quite good, with a public swimming pool. The taste of breakfast is average in the high-end hotels in Haitang Bay. The only regret is that I didn’t experience the infinity pool on the top floor. There was a private event on the day, and I was not allowed to enter at 3 pm, and the other pool was under maintenance and I was not allowed to enter. Therefore, if you want to experience the infinity pool, you must ask whether it can be used on the day before booking, after all, it is one of the hotel's selling points.
Service: First of all, I would like to thank shelly for her service. She is very caring. I added WeChat one day in advance, and I answered every question. I also sent a lot of snacks and fruits. But the service in the lobby at the entrance of the hotel is different. Haha, if you want to experience high-quality service, choose Edison.

msg:The room type I ordered this time is the Supreme Sea View Room. Baby Elisa directly upgraded me to a 180-degree full sea view double bed room with a super large balcony facing the sea.
Because I went there for my birthday, I was given birthday gifts and a birthday cake!
The layout of the room is very reasonable, with wooden decoration style, and the mattress and bedding are also super comfortable, because I forgot to bring an eye mask, Elisa baby also arranged for me. There is also an oversized bathtub in the room. It is really relaxing to take a bath while looking at the sea view. The room service is very good, specially sent welcome fruit and coconut.
The hotel service is really considerate. The next day, I told the customer service auntie that I love to drink water, and gave me a table full of water, for fear that I would run out of water. I love it!
Lying on the sofa on the balcony every night before falling asleep and hearing the sound of the waves is so healing. The sound insulation effect of the room is super invincible, the sound in the room is turned on very loudly, and the balcony door is closed, it cannot be heard from the outside at all.
The hotel's breakfast is until 11 o'clock, with both Chinese and Western styles, satisfying my sweet tooth.
There are many scenes in the hotel for girls to take pictures. The sea bar on the 13th floor is really good. By the way, the fried chicken in the sea bar is really delicious.
I really recommend young couples to go! There are few children and very quiet, so you don't want to leave after staying here! I will stay here next time I go to Sanya. This time I had a very good experience. I am really satisfied with the arrangement of Baby Elisa! ! !

msg:As a senior hotel tester, I must say that the operation of Rosewood Sanya Poly is not OK. Poly is a state-owned enterprise. It should be under the leadership of the government, and it is more adhering to the business philosophy and attitude of serving the people. However, in the two-day hotel experience, the roughness of the hardware, the rigidity and indifference of the service staff, and the lack of attention to details were revealed everywhere.
    In short, it is not recommended to live on vacation, especially for single ladies. Or friends who are very private. Let's start talking about the questions. To be honest, there are too many questions. Let's pick a few important ones.
    1. Not paying attention to the safety of residents. I checked in by myself on April 29 (I am a woman), and my husband came to see me the next day. I asked the hotel to deliver something and listened to music on the balcony, maybe I didn't hear the doorbell. The service staff entered the room without my permission. If I was in the shower, or naked, or doing something else, it's not a service issue, it's an illegal issue, my friends, that's exaggerating. The service staff here seem to have a universal room card? (This is just my guess) There must be loopholes in the system and the professionalism of the service. Anyway, from my experience, the safety, privacy, and property safety of the residents cannot be guaranteed.
   Second, if you need customer service to provide services, you need enough patience. During the stay at the hotel, I asked the customer service for alcohol wipes, scissors, screwdrivers, etc., and I waited for at least two hours for the alcohol wipes (I wanted to wipe the toilet conveniently). Others are at least forty minutes or more. I forgot to bring my room card after swimming, and ran to the first floor wet in my swimsuit to ask for help to open the door. The service staff on the first floor asked me to go to the 14th floor to replace the room card.
  3. When you complain to customer service, they basically ignore it. I reported the problem to the room sales and duty manager and the room sales offered to send me some nightly snacks which were not delivered. The next day I said you could send a coconut to my room. I went out at 10 am and went back at 4 pm and didn't see it. This kind of arrogant service attitude is simply unheard of.
   Fourth, there are various details. There are many flaws in the hardware, and the quilt is always wet. (I have been to Madai twice, as well as Bali, and Banyan Tree Sanya, etc. The quilts are all dry. So the island is not the reason.) There are many small bugs in the room and restaurant. This is the same, and these can be solved The method, the island is not the reason. Be careful with babies with sensitive skin. Also, the waiters at each position are very unprofessional and will not solve the problem. There are still some service issues, please see the screenshots, anyway, it caused me a lot of trouble. Also, the first time I saw the hotel's shower gel and shampoo is a fixed bottle, you can't take it away. see it? Behind this is the attitude of standing on the opposite side with customers.
   All in all, highly not recommended. Vacations can affect your mood.

msg:This time, I brought my wife to stay at Poly Rosewood, and I specially asked for leave to travel on a staggered peak. Just after booking the room, Elisa from the hotel called to inquire about our needs, helped us arrange the room, replenished the minibar in time during the stay, and extended the check-out time. As a traveler, I feel very comfortable. In addition, in terms of the hotel environment, the vegetation coverage is particularly high. There are three swimming pools, and the gym is not big enough. The scenery on the 13th floor is very good, with a wide view and a refreshing view. The room I stayed in this time is a 180 sea view room, with a great view Great, open the curtains in the morning to see the sea, the room is big, equipped with slippers, beach bag, convenient to play on the beach of the hotel, and finally the staff are very enthusiastic, from the moment they arrive at the hotel to open the door to carry the luggage, greet each other with a smile, and swim in the pool The staff will help with water and bath towels

msg:As the name suggests, the hotel is full of sense of design. The rooms and the interior of the hotel are very artistic. It is the most comfortable hotel I have ever stayed in in Haitang Bay, and I am reluctant to leave it. On the day of check-in, I was upgraded to a room with a full sea view for free, and I was also given 2 coconuts and a bottle of red wine. The morning yoga class is right by the pool, and the experience is absolutely perfect. The room service is quite satisfactory. Thanks to the housekeeper Lynn for her thoughtful assistance, I will bring my family to experience it next time. The breakfast needs to be enriched, but overall it is quite good. It is recommended for couples and friends to travel together.

msg:Shuai Shuai doesn't understand. It's very strange that Rosewood is such a good hotel that people often get hacked. Every time I come, I will live in my favorite room with a 180-degree sea view. It has a great view and faces Wuzhizhou Island. The scenery is beautiful, whether it's the interior or the beach, no matter where the hotel is. It is very suitable for punching in and taking pictures. The sound insulation is very good, unlike many other hotels that are very noisy and cannot sleep peacefully. The facilities are very well maintained and do not look old at all. The comparison is already unsightly. Reese, MO, and Park Hyatt are completely hanging.

    The breakfast is very good, and the ones in the Rosewood series are quite good. I have always liked it. The hotel restaurant is generally quite satisfactory. There is nothing special about it. After all, the food in Sanya is generally very good. Tianlu, Xianhai, and broiled are relatively delicious. I recommend it. In fact, I think Those fish steakhouses on Monkey Island are the most worth visiting. After all, they are a bit unique. The queen at the front desk of the hotel has super good service and feels like home. I will continue to come again next time.

msg:Let’s evaluate this hotel objectively: I first stayed in the swimming pool room on the second floor to the left. You can see the sea view at about 90 degrees. Because the floor is low and green, you can’t really see the sea when taking photos; My sister helped me upgrade the room type. When I got to the swimming pool room on the 6th floor, I could see a 180-degree sea view. The scenery is really great, even the rainy day in the morning has a special flavor. My husband said that it was a pity that we only stayed for one night. We should stay for a few more days. Maybe we can also visit Wuzhizhou Island, which is opposite, and the itinerary experience will be better. In short, the location of the hotel is good, the scenery is beautiful, and the vacation is very comfortable!

msg:Beijing Rosewood has the most beautiful indoor swimming pool, and Sanya Poly Rosewood's infinity pool is an important reason why we chose it (and the reason why we didn't choose the pool room type😊).

The hotel gave a 180-degree sea view room on the highest floor of the 9th floor, facing Wuzhizhou Island, with a very good view. In the afternoon and evening, lazing on the balcony sofa is our favorite moment😂. The structure design of the bubble pool is very reasonable, and you have to soak it once a day!

The infinity pool on the 13th floor is beautiful. The afternoon tea at the sea bar next to the pool is delicious and beautiful. There are also foreigner DJs playing discs. There are too many Internet celebrities to take pictures😅. It’s a bit messy. Fortunately, the pool only accepts overnight guests, and there are almost no people at noon , The venue is reserved, taking pictures is invincible! There are also black and white spiral staircases on the 13th and 14th floors.

The location of the hotel is very good. It is convenient to go anywhere. There are few people on the beach, the scenery is good and the sand is soft (no coconut grove). It is a good place to take a walk after dinner. Be careful that there are many damages to the wooden floor. I hope it can be repaired as soon as possible.

The customer service Elissa is very responsible and helped arrange a lot of things. The hotel service is also very good: the room is arranged in advance, fruit is welcome, fresh coconuts are delivered every day, small snacks are delivered every day when the bed is turned down, and a big bag is given every time you ask for water. Minibar Snacks are free, and late check-out is also given. It is indeed a representative of luxury hotels. 👍

By the way, we eat too much every day, so we found a ping-pong ball machine in the 24-hour yoga room, and played for a long time, which was very enjoyable🤣.

The most unacceptable thing is the service, the service, the service!
The people here either have eyes that go up to the sky.

The room type was upgraded for free, the weather was not very good but the scenery still made me feel good. The hotel environment is what I like, simple and clean without any embellishments. The service is just right, not overdone nor lacking in interaction. When staying in a hotel, don’t over-digging reviews, you have to feel it yourself. Sometimes a little flaw is part of the trip, but Rosewood makes me feel just right.

It is more suitable for young people, especially couples.

msg:Before I left, the housekeeper Elisa had already contacted me one day in advance to provide me with various consulting services in advance. At that moment, I felt that the vacation had begun! Elisa is very considerate, and she gave a honeymoon decoration near Valentine's Day, and the wine she gave was Perrier-Jouët from the Champagne region of France, which is great! This stay is comfortable and full. I got two servings of fruit, and all the minibar, as well as afternoon snacks, the rhythm of raising pigs🐷
The sea view of the room is very intoxicating whether it is morning, afternoon or evening! see picture!
I saw a lot of people saying that the privacy of the pool room is not good enough. It may not be the peak season when I stay, and the sound insulation is quite good. Even if I am close to the elevator, there is no sound of the elevator all night. Although you can see the balconies of other rooms from the balcony, everyone is on their own holidays. If you want privacy, go back to the room and close the curtains. The blinds of the bathtub can also be closed. And in fact, as long as you return to the bed position, you can't see anything outside even if you don't draw the curtains, so it's not a big problem.
The most important thing here is that I can lie in bed and watch the sunrise on the sea, and be able to stare at the unpredictable seascape all day long, which is already worth the fare!
The swimming pool in the room is not constant temperature. It is still relatively cold in February, but it is beautiful!
The room is very interesting. There are two doors for the shower room. The bed is also connected to the sink. The whole room is designed with the word "back". Tea, coffee, face masks, alcohol hand sanitizer and all kinds of stationery are available, as well as magnificent postcards!
His infinity pool is a real internet celebrity, and there are really many internet celebrities checking in. I happened to go there when the sun was hottest, and there was only one old man swimming there. It is estimated that Internet celebrities don’t take cold pictures, but I am afraid of getting tanned. I really didn’t take into account whether I am dark or not. Even if the temperature is constant, the staff said that it is only 30 degrees, and it will still be a bit cool if you go into the water at 20 degrees, and the wind is very strong. Children It is recommended to go to the one on the 1st floor to play, it is not easy to catch cold.
I really need to write about the breakfast. I have never seen a buffet breakfast with air-dried ham, or two! There are 3 types of smoked salmon: original, tart and seasoned! The most surprising thing is that there are fried ghosts, soy milk and tofu flower. There are 3 types of porridge and 8 or 9 kinds of side dishes. Tofu flower caters to the tastes of people all over the country.
Juice includes carrot juice 🥕, cucumber juice 🥒, cantaloupe juice 🍈, watermelon 🍉 juice, mango milkshake 🥭, mango juice, dragon fruit milkshake, grape juice 🍇, grapefruit juice, coconut juice 🥥
Orange juice 🍊 Turn on the tap and look at the freshly squeezed juicer
Not counting Coke, Sprite, hot and cold milk, yogurt, hot tea and coffee☕️
The most outrageous breakfast has ice cream, and there are still 3 flavors!
There is a distance from the beach, and there will be a battery car at the entrance of the hotel to pick you up, but I found it too late, so I walked to the garden by myself. The greenery along the way is very comfortable, and there is also a large lawn. It is said that the hotel will provide frisbees, which is suitable for children to play wildly.
The beach is very windy and the water quality is good, but the sand is not fine and there are some garbage, but it is enough to take pictures.
It is very convenient to the duty-free shop. Generally speaking, it is really suitable for vacation. I will definitely come again next time!

msg:I travel to Sanya 4 times a year, and this time I chose to stay at Rosewood. I have always stayed at JW Marriott every time I come here. I went to Guangzhou to stay at Rosewood some time ago and thought the service was very good. Then this time I wanted to try Rosewood in Sanya. Maybe my expectations are better. The high-quality service is seriously inconsistent with the value of the brand. When I arrived at the hotel at 9pm on the first day, the hotel doorman showed no reaction when he saw the car coming. He wandered over and did not take the initiative to take the luggage. It was surprising. The hotel lobby was at 14 On the first floor, the staff member Elissa gave us an upgraded room type. To be honest, the room is quite satisfactory. It is not a smart toilet. The bedding is too soft. We have to ask for the green coconuts the next day. The hotel environment is also average. Sanya Magnificent is surprising, except for the service. The staff, Elizabeth, was satisfactory, but otherwise the price-performance ratio was too low, so I would not recommend it! !

I contacted Grace before check-in, and helped to make reservations for the Rainforest Rain and Sunburn restaurant. If I hadn't asked her, I would have almost missed the wonderful dinner! The overall service is very good and very enthusiastic~ You can find her directly if you have anything to do during your stay. She is very caring and convenient. I will come to Rosewood again if I have the opportunity. Recommended recommendation~
ps: You can also play with your baby

She introduced us to the room type, upgraded us for one night, and even applied for free breakfast for one person. Since we did not make an early reservation, We ran out of coconuts, and COCO promised to make them up for us the next day. We went out for breakfast the next day, and the coconuts were delivered to the room on time. COCO is really caring. I must give 10086 likes👍I will find her again next time. The hotel attendant is also very polite, the service is good, all the luggage is delivered to the room for us, and when we leave, he helps us move the luggage from the room to the car. The hotel buffet breakfast is also very good, with many varieties. This trip is very happy , Thank you COCO for the caring service of the hotel staff, I will stay at Rosewood next time I go to Sanya.

The configuration of the bar and infinity pool on the 13th floor is outstanding. The environment, food products and service details of the restaurant are all satisfactory. The complimentary morning yoga experience saved my stiff shoulders and back from a few days of business trip. Thanks to Grace for her considerate and decent service, which helped me smoothly solve the embarrassing situation of people leaving their ID cards in the guest room at the next hotel.

This time, reviews will be made in batches from sleep, catering, entertainment, landscape and other aspects. Sleep: The most comfortable and expensive items in the guest room are bedding and mattresses. They sleep very comfortably all night, and the whole body falls into a deep sleep. With the addition of double-layer sliding low-e glass doors, the outside The sound is completely isolated from the room, and the sound processing of the central air conditioner is also very quiet! Catering: For breakfast, there are many choices of fruits, buns, porridge, juices, and noodles...Lunch can be eaten on the 13th floor, and the products are not bad! Entertainment: The most beautiful swimming pool in the entire Haitang Bay is here. Needless to say, it is entertaining and ornamental, but I didn’t take many pictures. The whole swimming pool can swim in the swimming pool when there are few people. It is a very good enjoyment ! Landscape: Elisa arranged a place where you can face the sunrise as soon as you step out of the balcony door. Facing Wuzhizhou Island, you can have a panoramic view of the sunrise. It’s a very good landscape! In addition, the selection of books in the guest room is also very good. I chose books that make the vacation feel full, such as National Geographic magazine and ********* authors "Walking, Inseparable", "Drinking Tea", etc. It is very relaxing after a day and night. Thank you again The enthusiasm of Rosewood Hotel (it is not easy to insist on arranging turndown and snacks for each guest room, like it 👍)

msg:Sanya Poly Rosewood is quite popular recently. There is Zhou Yangqing checking in at the front, and the front at the back. The editor-in-chief of vogue checks in and recommends it. The whole hotel is full of artistic details and is very suitable for fashionable young people. The infinity pool on the 13th floor can overlook Wuzhizhou Island (model design Reminiscent of the Hilton in Pattaya, very similar)
The hotel room is equipped with a large sea-view bathtub, so it is recommended that the room type must be a 180-degree full sea view room.
The internal structure of the hotel is very well separated from wet and dry, and the balcony is very large, which is suitable for ordering a late-night takeaway beer barbecue with sea breeze. The bedside table has unlimited charging is also a plus detail. The only embarrassment is that the TV and the bed are skewed. If you lie on the bed, don't watch TV. Your neck will be twisted. The fruit in the store is a bit shabby and there are only three apples. The breakfast is not too star-level.
Hotel facilities: The independent glass room on the first floor of the gym is great. The hotel's exclusive private beach can only be said to be okay. The waves are very big this season, just walk along the beach.
The overall check-in experience is still very good. There are many hotels in Sanya, and Rosewood's overall details and services are well done. It's worth it!

msg:In the past two years, I have been to the Capella EDITION Park Hyatt. This time I wanted to experience the beauty of the tallest building. Sanya has always been known for comfort and relaxation, so staying in a hotel is a good way to relax. However, the experience of staying at the Rosewood this time was very bad. It can be described as a disaster, and it also forces me not to choose Rosewood Sanya again. When I got off the car and entered the lobby, there was no hotel staff to help me open the door. I think Park Hyatt and Edison in the same price range have done this and made me feel at home. Secondly, when I entered the hotel to check in, I thought it was at the front desk on the first floor. However, a "big brother" at the concierge repeatedly emphasized and told me that it was on the 14th floor, and looked at my face and said harshly. No less than 5 times, I felt very offended, uncomfortable and even disgusted. Moreover, the environment and service of Sanya Rosewood are incompatible with any of the hotels I mentioned above. In short, I will not go to Sanya Poly Magnificent again, nor will I recommend, stop, or comment on it. I wish you all the best!

Thank you very much💓

Facilities: The swimming pool in the room can be heated. This is really great in the current weather. You can take pictures in the small pool in your room and play in the water. When you are tired, you can lie on the deck chair and eat in a daze. Welcome fruit. The table and coffee table in the room I like the layout very much. The bed is soft and I like it. I sleep soundly. The location of charging and switch design is very convenient.

Environment: The skyline infinity pool is really impressive. The ground floor garden and various pools and gardens are designed with a sense of winding steps. Every step, every scene looks different. I really like the small view at the restaurant. The private care is also very good. Basically, it is quiet and quiet without the noisy feeling of a resort hotel. The ice cream outside the fisherman's restaurant is delicious! Especially the sea salt caramel-flavored breakfast on the 13th floor is also very good. There are muffins, tonics and salmon towers. The quality of ham is better than that of ordinary hotels. The hot Chinese dishes are also delicious.

Hygiene: The cleaning is very clean and timely, the turndown service is completed quietly, and the toiletries in the room are well replenished

Service: The wine and fruit provided in the hotel package were delivered in a timely manner. The more detailed one is that there are pears in the Jingzhe fruit on the second day. The front desk, restaurant, meal delivery and spa services are all very happy to pass by. The staff will also say hello, so it is very comfortable to come here for vacation. I hope to come again next time~

I especially like the magnificent service. The overall quality of the service staff is very high, especially the little housekeeper, Ms. Shelly. She is kind but unobtrusive and worthy of praise. Every time there is a small problem, she will patiently and meticulously solve it, especially after knowing that I have a baby. He took the initiative to help us upgrade to a quieter room type, with many heart-warming details and services
I will consider staying here next time, the afternoon tea is also delicious~

msg:Let’s give a good evaluation of this hotel. On the one hand, the environment is elegant. "Although the public area is not very big compared to other star hotels", it is worthy of positioning and consumption. The room design, style including furniture placement, space layout, etc. should be the most comfortable of all star hotels I have stayed in. It is very young and modern, and this is definitely a plus. The breakfast is quite satisfactory, with neither too many nor too few varieties. Simply put, it is ordinary. This time I stayed in the hotel and upgraded the room, and also arranged a tent for children to play, very NICE! Service is average. The sanitation is quite satisfactory "Xiaoqiang was found dead, although he changed the room for me later". The air conditioner in the room makes abnormal noise, rattling. How to say, to sum up, there is really no perfect hotel, I can understand it, I can only say that the next time I come to Sanya, the Rosewood Hotel is still in my list, and I will give it a priority

All in all, the experience is too bad. It is not as good as a hotel with a price of about 1,500 yuan. The price/performance ratio is very low and I don’t have a good impression at all. The hotel management is very careless, cares too much about money, and doesn't have the proper attitude. Money speaks for itself!

msg:The first bad feeling comes from the price. Rooms with swimming pools are more than 1,000 more expensive than ordinary rooms. The result: the swimming pool is only larger than the bathtub. If you are taller, you can't stretch your legs... The second bad feeling is It feels like the corridors in the hotel are very long, and they are open corridors... This kind of corridor is usually very windy... If you are in Room 01-06, you have to walk for a long time, and you are facing the hot and humid wind... , then return to the room, just open the balcony door, and then open the room door, the wind... whirring... the door can't be closed... The third bad feeling is the carpet under the bed, so expensive Hotel, carpet is dirty! You can see the stains! I dare not not wear slippers in the room. Although the service is still okay, I really don’t recommend it.

I didn't even enter the room, where did I get the room card? The scenery, equipment, room service, and meals are impeccable. It was also the first time I felt the feeling of waiting to check in.

Another sign for the outdoor fisherman pointed to the locked side of the restaurant. In addition, the directions for the children's center and spa were also unclear, which caused a lot of trouble. Big inconvenience; second, the hotel's food and beverages are disappointing, especially the fisherman's restaurant on the first floor, which is like a roadside stall outsourced to a seafood stall. It's exquisite, and saved a little bit of goodwill; third, the hotel's room service is relatively fast. During the Spring Festival, there are more people staying, but they can deliver what customers need in a timely manner, but the welcome on the first floor is a bit neglected and rude impolite.

They have almost stayed in the row of hotels in Haitang Bay. The comfort of Magnificent Room is definitely no.1. People who have difficulty sleeping can sleep until they wake up naturally every day; the infinity pool on the 13th floor is so beautiful; my butler Grace is also responsive to every request, and greets her every morning, which is very heartwarming. However, there are quite a few bugs. Just like everyone’s feedback, the privacy is poor, and you can almost see everything from the upstairs and downstairs on the balcony. The volume of the hotel is estimated to be the smallest in this area. It is suitable for couples or individuals to relax. Bringing a baby is a bit boring, but it is also an advantage. , because Art, Edison, and Crown are really too noisy, and there are heads everywhere

Because there are villas and residences, the hotel garden is also very small, a small *****, and the wooden plank road used by the sea is almost completely rotten and has not been replaced. But the design of the room is really comfortable. It is great to come to the room to lie down for 2 days, and go to the infinity pool during the period. The hotel's main restaurant is closed one evening... which is confusing as there is only one main restaurant left for the evening. You always have to wait for a long time to call the front desk, and sometimes you don't answer.... When I checked in and got out of the elevator, I was asked if I was here to participate in the BMW event. If I didn't, I just dumped the word "over there". On the day of check-out, I first stored my luggage and then went to the hotel restaurant for lunch. The front desk on the 13th floor asked me to store it on the first floor by myself. I always emphasized that the concierge department stores luggage on the first floor. I said that I might not have gone to the 1st floor to deposit and ran up to eat, so I took my luggage away😅.

Later, I found that many empty tables were not cleared away, and the egg and noodle cookers were also confused and couldn't figure out which customer wanted what, and there was also a situation where there was no rice noodles.

Also upgraded the room type, facing Wuzhizhou Island, the view is superb! Luggage was delivered to the room quickly, fruit, young coconuts, and children's toiletries were also turned down. The service at the swimming pool was also great! The swimming pool is so beautiful and the water temperature is okay. Even though we encountered a cold current when we checked in, the children still swam. The breakfast was good too Bar. The overall Elisa arrangement is very good, the service is superb, the facilities are good, the view is good, and I will stay again

msg:The beauty derived from the Internet celebrity economy has one star for the sea view and one star for the restaurant on the first floor, but it performs poorly in other aspects.

1. This room type is completely unsuitable for being used as a hotel. Functional space was seriously sacrificed for sea views and balconies. Such a small bathroom and powder room make people feel extremely uncomfortable and completely lose the meaning of vacation.

2. The decoration is perfunctory, the functional space is cheap, the sound insulation effect is poor, and the corridors and aisles lack privacy.

3. The service staff is hurried, polite but indifferent.

4. I had hair for breakfast, although I was eventually given a solution.

All in all, perfunctory and perfunctory, a fast-food hotel in the internet celebrity economy, the worst experience ever at a Magnificent Hotel.

The front desk of the hotel even upgraded my room to a third level for free . I'm really happy. I read a lot of comments about the variety of breakfast, but I still eat very well and are full. Although there are few varieties, they are highly edible. Unlike many other hotels of the same level, there are many bells and whistles, but there are not many delicious ones.

When they learned that we have children, they thoughtfully arranged children’s supplies in the room. This time, they experienced Rosewood’s new room this year, the Family Cute Bear Suite. The decoration of the room is particularly liked by the children. 😘. The hotel specially arranged welcome fruits and special young coconuts, and specially prepared desserts for children. Daisy made a reservation in advance for us at the western restaurant of the hotel - Zhi when she learned of her wife's birthday. Returning to Rosewood again after 2020, the experience again is still great. The family has left good memories in Sanya. Rosewood can still stay away from the hustle and bustle. The scenery is beautiful. It was very comfortable to stay for two nights. I like the service of the hotel

msg:It should be an Internet celebrity store with extremely high net profit. As long as you find a southern team, the management and emergency response capabilities will not be so bad. There are many problems that may not exist in cheap chain hotels. If the floor drain smells bad, you have to find a way to remove it yourself. The air conditioner was turned on reluctantly, and it only dropped to 25 degrees after 16 hours of running. I can’t say much about the quality and taste of the breakfast, and the variety was pitiful. After driving around for two or three times, I didn’t know what to eat. I’m not afraid of being expensive, but I’m afraid that even if I teach you, I won’t be able to provide equivalent service and experience.

msg:Facilities: There is a small hall on the first floor, similar to a welcome bar. The counter goes to the 14th floor. After booking a room, you have to take the elevator to your room. It's not very convenient, and the furnishings in the room don't look practical. It takes up a lot of space. The bathroom and cloakroom are in the same place. There is no place to put suitcases. There is no water in the shower area. The bath water is under the feet and will not flow down. When you go out, a lot of water will be taken out, causing you to go in and out of other places. It’s also all water. The toilet in the bathroom is very small. The walls everywhere are basically made of white textured wood veneer, and a lot of dirty things are inside. It looks like no one has wiped it when cleaning. The carpet is also very dirty, with obvious black patches. Like it hasn't been washed in years. The entrance to the hotel seems very large, but in fact there are apar**ents above it. The garden looks large, but when you walk in, you realize that it is a private residential area and is enclosed. The garden is not practical and the outdoor swimming pool is not open to the public at night. The garden lights were so dark that I didn't dare to go out and walk around at night. I had no sense of experience and felt very stuffy. I was so worried that I couldn't go anywhere. The only view is the infinity pool, and you can't swim in it. It's just nice to take pictures, nothing else. The hotel doesn't have any facilities for children, and no swimming rings are provided for adults. There is nothing for adults to entertain. The hotel's breakfast was okay, but we didn't have any lunch or dinner. The dinner cost more than 600 for two people, and it was super unpalatable. We ate the rest of the meals elsewhere. One time we ate at a duty-free shop. I recommended a restaurant called Green Tea, which we had eaten in Hangzhou at that time. Pretty good, five dishes cost just over 200. The price/performance ratio is very high, and the dishes are basically not too bad. It's all good. I really don’t have much time to take care of my children. The price of 2,500 is really not worth it and is too high. So I moved to the Marriott in Yalong Bay. I didn't apply for it at first, but when I came, I thought the price of 1,000 would kill them all. I recommend Marriott, I really recommend it. I didn't plan to comment at first, but when I came to Marriott, I became even more angry when I thought about it, so I wrote this nagging text to give you some suggestions, so it's really either expensive or good. I didn't feel bad about spending money to play. After all, I have children and spent it lonely.

Compared with other hotels that are full of people, Rosewood is absolutely outstanding in terms of privacy and service. It is definitely the first choice for vacation.
The magnificent breakfast is also super delicious, every day is forced to get up for breakfast
When you open your eyes, it's the sea 🌊

1. The training of the service staff is extremely poor. I just took a shower in the room in the afternoon, and it was not yet check-out time. The cleaning staff only rang the doorbell once and opened the door. The excuse given was that I had checked out.
2. You need to wait for a seat for breakfast, and there are very few breakfast varieties, less than half of the Edison.
3. I was skeptical about the cleanliness of the room. After sleeping all night, my face was itchy and allergic, which I had never experienced before.

Summary: The Edison is worth a lot at the same price, and the service is also very thoughtful.

msg:Poly Rosewood is very popular now🔥, Sicong visited the store before, and Coco Li moved in later. Therefore, in the itinerary of Sanya, a 3-day and two-night experience of Poly Magnificence was arranged.
Intro: A hotel staff member (I'll call it the housekeeper later) will contact me in advance 2 days before check-in. Ask the guests about their habitual preferences, etc. I am a family of three, and the housekeeper kindly said that they will prepare children's toiletries and small cakes for the children. 👍🏻
🎆The luggage will be temporarily stored by a concierge when I arrive at the hotel. I need to go to the front desk on the 14th floor to check in. The procedure is simple and fast. But since I arrived at the store before 2pm, I had to wait for the room. During this time we went to the pool bar on the 13th floor for some drinks. The drinks are not unpleasant, and the average per capita consumption is 100 yuan. 🍸🍹🥃We were fortunate to be upgraded to a pool room. The room is clean and comfortable, and the snacks and drinks in the snack bar are free. For dinner that day, we had a buffet at the East Kitchen Restaurant on the 13th floor of the hotel. For the fee of 588 per person, in-house guests can enjoy 30% off, and the meal will not be evaluated here. The breakfast is free, varied and tastes average. The hotel is not far from Atlantis Water World and Duty Free City, and there is a 5% discount for shopping and hotel exclusives. You can tell the housekeeper to check out.
Disadvantages: The air conditioner in the room cannot cool down quickly
Pros: The pool has a great view, and it's not inferior to the infinity pool in Singapore.
Special praise to the hotel's housekeeper, Elissa! All requirements are met one by one, all questions are answered one by one. Just for this service it is worth giving 10 stars for the service ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

msg:Poly's magnificent 180-degree room is on the 10-12th floor, facing Wuzhizhou Island, and the bed is directly facing the sea view, which is very good
The most worth mentioning is the swimming pool and bar on the top floor, the view is infinitely good, although the summer sun shines, the swimming pool is not shaded almost all day, but the sea breeze blows, enjoy the sea, play with water and have a drink, the mood is very relaxed
However, I personally think that Poly has a lot of room for improvement. For example, when you check in, you can briefly introduce the facilities, how to pick up and drop off the beach by shuttle bus, and so on. Don't wait for the customer to ask questions before answering. Another example is the open-air swimming pool on the first floor. The swimming pool opens at nine o'clock. Why not clean up the fallen leaves before opening? The water in the swimming pool is slightly cloudy, and there are very few service staff in the swimming pool on the first floor. If the public facilities of a hotel can be equally meticulous, it may be able to win more repeat customers. Hope Paulie gets better and better.

Rosewood's account manager Elissa is particularly responsible and called me the day before. , also added WeChat. Because I was traveling with my daughter and grandson, I specially booked a suite. It was noon when we arrived at the hotel, and our room had not been cleaned. The three-year-old baby fell asleep, and it was very uncomfortable to lie in the car. Elissa checked it immediately. We asked the leaders to upgrade us to a suite with a 180-degree panoramic sea view, so that the children can take a comfortable nap. Elissa also specially asked the waiter to send some fruits. Thank you Elissa for her enthusiasm 🌹🌹🌹! Sanya Rosewood's Yujia Chinese Restaurant is very special, seafood, hot pot and home-cooked dishes are all delicious😋, Rosewood loves it as always😘😘😘!

Before this visit, she enthusiastically helped arrange the room, so I chose Rosewood Hotel again. After checking in, I can always feel the polite, thoughtful and meticulous service of Jianing, and the experience is also super good. Now the buffet breakfast is on the first floor in addition to the 14th floor. The food is fresh and rich in variety. The view of the room is super, the 11th floor is the supreme sea view.

When you stay in, you will deeply experience the feeling of coming home, the endor*****t of quality life, and in terms of design, the sense of privacy and openness, The feeling of vacation will not be disappointing. The shower room is cleverly independent and connected to the bedroom and bathroom. There are many ingenuities. The design of the room is full of sense. ? The breakfast is better than the average hotel. At least I, a person who cut off carbohydrates, didn't feel full, the quality of the food is worthy of the price, and the overall service of the restaurant is also good. It's not easy, it can be seen that the management is in place!
The reason for a pleasant vacation is the human factor. My housekeeper Daisy makes me always want to come back here, so as not to go to other hotels and not get the same service, the hotel's Sky Pool and the main swimming pool are beautiful shocked! The idea of worrying that high-rise buildings are not enough for vacations has also dispelled. The balcony of the hotel gives people the feeling of a large cruise ship. The magnificent brand is well-deserved! The best in Sanya, no one!

🍃Environment: Quiet, comfortable, not noisy, no loud talking and screaming of children.
🔔Service: The details are in place: there are chairs in the lobby, so that checkin and checkout guests can sit and wait without getting tired. When you get to the room, you will be given fresh coconuts, so that you can enjoy the coconut and watch the sea view. The shampoo can be good and the hair is very glossy after washing and blowing. The dishes of the restaurant on the 13th floor are rich and varied, and the ingredients and tastes are very good. It is especially worth mentioning that Mr. Bian, the duty manager, added WeChat when checking in to provide us with convenient services, responsive to our requests, and solved our various problems and needs during our stay. Made us feel comfortable and convenient after our stay. As the last stop, we received good service at Rosewood Poly, and our trip to Sanya came to a successful conclusion, leaving a good impression on Rosewood Poly. Next time, Rosewood Poly is the first choice.

  It should belong to one of Poly's real estate projects, connecting hotels with apar**ents, real estate villas, and so on. 2-12 floors are hotel rooms, 13 floors related facilities, restaurants, swimming pools, etc., the 14th floor lobby is settled, many parts of other buildings belong to apar**ents, surrounding villa projects, real estate projects, business forums and conferences, etc. The characteristics of large state-owned enterprises can be seen at a glance.
  There are three restaurants, one of which is far away, by the sea, so I haven't experienced it yet. The other two, one on the first floor, one on the 13th floor, the higher room type, the breakfast on the 13th floor, the lower one on the first floor, the meals are similar, but the 13th floor has a better view. The breakfast is average. The breakfast bar of a normal star hotel.
The bar and restaurant are mixed together, both on the 13th floor, the bar is very general. Indeed, a five-star hotel costing 1,000 yuan in the mainland can be sold for 3,000 yuan in Sanya. The coast of Sanya, where every inch of land is so precious.
 Service, normal, average.
 On the day of settlement, there was a typhoon and the swimming pool was not used. Experience the infinity pool the next day. The room facilities are normal, and the bath supplies are not in small bottles, similar to the large bottles in the Express Hotel, which are fixed on the wall.

The Kung Fu Hotel staff went into the room with only children and set up the turndown. At night, we all fell asleep, and the staff opened the door and entered the room for no reason, saying that they would deliver snacks! ! ! The most unacceptable thing is that I asked the hotel staff at the breakfast buffet on the day of check-out if I could ask the hotel staff if I could take away the bread that the child hadn’t finished eating, but I was rejected and said that I couldn’t pack it. Please, the child ate half of the bread and put it in a box. Can't you take it away? ? ? It's really too bad. I will definitely not live for the second time!

I temporarily booked the three nights at Rosewood and stayed in two room types. After the Rosewood our trip was perfect, the room was nice, the service was nice and the view was beautiful. After sweeping away the haze before, it will be a little more magnificent in the future. The restaurant downstairs, Yujia, is delicious. Although the buffet in the morning is not too much, it is very delicate. And the breakfast environment is very good. I have basically experienced all the good hotels in Haitang Bay, Sanya, but this time staying at Rosewood can still give us a very amazing feeling. Personally, I think Rosewood is more suitable for couples vacation, and there are not many public facilities in other hotels. I think the room is unique. Finally, I would like to commend our housekeeper Olivia, who helped us upgrade the room type, and also sent the room card to our room without going to the front desk when changing rooms in the middle.

msg:I chose Rosewood Sanya as a stopover for the sea training. The environment, food, and service are all very good. Olivia's service is very good for guest relations. You can find her if you need anything during your stay. The hotel is very close to the beach, and it takes about ten minutes to walk. (Although I didn't go) I heard that the infinity pool and afternoon tea on the 13th floor are special features, but unfortunately I didn't have a chance to go this time because I was too tired and sunburned. The hotel is very quiet and there are no children in other hotels making my hair panic. It is more suitable for couples to travel or rest on vacation. Next time, I will come back to experience the a**osphere of the holiday, this time it was rotten to patronize.

The hotel has beautiful scenery. The sea bar and infinity pool on the 13th floor are very suitable for taking pictures. The hotel service is also very good. The guest relations manager Elisa is very attentive. The beach next to the hotel is clean and the sand is fine. The children had a great time! When taking children to the beach, be sure to let the hotel&#39;s sightseeing bus pick them up, otherwise there is still a little distance to go to the beach, just walk for 15 minutes.

This is the first time I have encountered this in a high-end 5-star hotel, and the details of the hotel can be seen. The water cup in the room is also a crystal cup. It is not the first time for me to go there. The first few times I went to have afternoon tea on the 13th floor. This invincible scenery and Internet celebrity check-in place, commanding the sea to kill Sanya and even the natural landscape of afternoon tea anywhere in the country. Every time I come to Sanya, I have to go for afternoon tea, and the photos I take every time are very beautiful, very beautiful. This time, there is even an absolute blockbuster. I think it is very similar to Botcelli's "The Birth of Venus". In this invincible scenery, people can stretch freely, and the body, mind and nature are so integrated and accepted. At that moment, the combination of heaven and earth made me keep a photo posted on Xiaohongshu with over 20,000 views in two days.
This stay experience is very good, more time to feel the hotel's environment, food, rooms and other high-quality services. The breakfast in the hotel is very rich in variety, exquisite, and the quality is absolutely excellent. The latte coffee is the best I have encountered in the domestic hotel breakfast. The hotel beach can also take pictures of horseback riding. I would like to thank Olivra Xiaozhong from the guest depar**ent. The service is really very caring. Call ahead to arrange check-in before check-in. After checking in, take the trouble to introduce the hotel's facilities, entertainment and dining one by one. Fresh fruit drinks are arranged every morning and evening. Very good. thank you very much. Amway friends have already stayed at Poly, and they will also stay at Poly Rosewood when they go to Sanya after the year. Rosewood Poly is the first choice for Haitang Bay vacations.

First of all, let me say that the service is very good👍🏼, the hotel hardware and software are nothing to say, and the landscape is invincible. Living in a 180-degree sea view room on the 11th floor, the balcony is large and the view is wide, making people feel that all the troubles and pressures are blown away by the sea breeze. I originally stayed for three nights. On the third night, I temporarily decided to change to a hotel in another area due to the epidemic. The receptionist at the front desk let me check out without saying a word. After waiting for the bus downstairs, the refund will be credited. When the baby comes to Sanya, choose Rosewood Hotel. I was a little confused. I booked two rooms and one order. On the day of check-in, only my sister’s room delivered snacks. My room was not delivered. I should have forgotten it, but it does not affect the overall high-level service of the hotel.

Guest Relations Olivia's reply is timely and well arranged. He took the initiative to help us upgrade the room type. When he proposed to change the hard mattress, he provided us with a palm cushion. Although we have not met, it is worthy of recognition.

🍃 Environment:
The sea view is facing Wuzhizhou Island, but unfortunately it rained in those days, otherwise it would be good to watch the sunrise and sunset in the room, and the sea view may account for more than half of the house price.

🧹Hygiene:
This is not very satisfactory. The carpet in the guest room is very old, black and gray, and it is recommended to clean it directly. The sofa on the balcony is also stained and oily.

🚽Facilities:
Although the hair dryer is Dyson, the toilet is not an electric toilet, which surprised me. And the toiletries are in locked jumbo bottles. The walls in the toilet were a little damp, so in terms of facilities, I didn't think it was great.

msg:When checking out, everyone must check their own consumption list. When I check out, the money consumed by others will be linked to my room. Everyone must take a good look at their consumption list.
Advantages: The environment can be said to be very good. Compared with other hotels during the Chinese New Year, there are few people and quiet. The quality of the guests staying is relatively high.
About the feeling after moving in:
Hotels in peak season cannot be booked on a single day and must stay for two consecutive days
The price service of more than 4,000 per night is really much worse than other hotels. Although there is customer service➕WeChat, the most basic hotel nearby the location and time for accounting needs to be called by the guests themselves.
In terms of breakfast, the room type is different. The cheap room type is the fisher house on the first floor. Most of them are the same as the upstairs, but there is no freshly squeezed vegetable juice. I eat breakfast for everyone ➕ 100 on the 13th floor. There are few people and the environment is good and there are many varieties.
There is a Southeast Asian restaurant on the 13th floor, which is very authentic. There is a restaurant in the garden on the first floor. Western food is also very authentic, but it is only open in the evening and needs to be booked in advance.
There are no items to play here, just sleep and be quiet. There is no private beach, the beach is for marketing, this hotel can only be experienced once
Average price/performance ratio

After checking in, the hotel successively sent red wine, fruit, children's night snacks and Dior samples with flowers for comfort. The vigilance of the attention and service awareness of the in-house guests is still worthy of affirmation in the later stage.

🍃Environment: From the first moment I got off the bus, it gave me a sense of order and quiet. Luggage is sent directly to the room by the concierge, and guests do not need to drag their luggage to check in. Free your hands! Compared with the crowded flow of people in the old five-star lobby, it is a far cry

🛏️ Bedding: This is my personal satisfaction, the height of the pillow and the firmness of the bed are just right, very comfortable, my child and I sleep well every day.


🔔Service: The swimming pool in the room is very clean and constant temperature. It is a little cold at night. The child is a seamless switch between the swimming pool and the bathtub, which is also a lot of fun.

🍴Restaurant: There are not too many varieties of breakfast in the hotel, but the quality and taste are generally good. The room can also deliver meals, so you don't have to worry about three meals if you are too lazy to go out and stay in the room for a whole day.

msg:The magnificent sea view is really beautiful. When I opened my eyes in the morning, I saw the sunrise. The whole room was filled with the sunshine. The location is very good. It is only a ten-minute drive from the duty-free shop. The quality of the restaurant is also very high. There are also many choices for breakfast. The experience is good. I booked the water table of the restaurant with my lover for dinner. I have small cakes and candles, and the experience is great. The day before check-in, there is a manager who adds WeChat to provide services at any time. The relationship manager Elisa has a caring and thoughtful service. We have many questions, but they all patiently help us answer and arrange them one by one. Received roses and snacks, the romance of the new year is given by Magnificent, and my husband agreed that I will choose to stay at Magnificent next time👍

msg:Like the magnificent, strong privacy. I experienced the swimming pool room, the swimming pool is small and exquisite, the water is clean, and the children are very happy. It's a pity to catch up with Sanya to cool down, I can't play for a long time, and when I catch up with this room, I feel that there is no sun in the shade, which is more suitable for summer use. Staying at Rosewood for three consecutive days, I would like to thank the guests for their relationship with Farrah, caring, greeting, responsive, and caring. Rosewood is especially suitable for fashionistas looking for privacy.

msg:🚗 Transportation: Rosewood is the hotel on the farthest side, it's cold~ the wind whizzing by at night will give you the illusion that a typhoon is coming.

🧹Hygiene: Generally speaking, there is nothing to say. The steps of the swimming pool in the room are yellow and the carpet is hard to describe, but it may be because of the humid weather or something.

🍃Environment: Very unsuitable for children, try not to choose this place with children. There are a lot of mosquitos in the swimming pool room, and it is in the same place as the apar**ent. Every day, you can see residents who are doing laundry and hanging clothes and smoking. I'm a little dazed...
🔔Service: It should be that the management requires "we want to serve in place", but no one teaches the staff how to be "in place", causing the service experience to be a roller coaster every day. It's just unprofessional. First of all, because we had to make milk powder with our children, we called for twelve more bottles of water on the first day (we do consume a lot of water, but we actually accept our own consumption), and it took 40 minutes to deliver the water on the first day, (but twelve The bottle can be sent, but it will be changed the next day) The housekeeping depar**ent said that there is only one staff member in the entire hotel to handle all the needs of the room. A staff member ran hundreds of rooms... Blame me... The next day I contacted the Ctrip staff because there were too many mosquitoes in the middle of the night and I couldn't sleep and the room did not have five-star standard body lotion. After many problems, the room manager contacted me and said Will take care of all issues. Here comes the important point. On the same day, I mentioned that the water consumption is high with children. At the same time, I contacted the housekeeping depar**ent to ask for water. The housekeeping depar**ent said, "We only provide ten bottles of water." I said, "You can charge for it." The housekeeping depar**ent said, "No, we are free of charge"... ……………… This means that you serve well or are you a shaft. Of course, a box of water was sent later and I really felt the enthusiasm of the housekeeping depar**ent on the third day. At the same time, their laundry is very good 👍The laundry depar**ent is still very good. I thought the service was improving. On the day of check-out, I received a phone call at 11:00 and asked me what time to check out. I asked what time to check out. The hotel told them that it was 12:00. It was also the first time in so many years that I stayed in a hotel and was notified in advance that I needed to check out on time. Overall, after the Sanya experience, all the magnificence has been blacked out. It is not on the same level as other hotels around.
Let’s also talk about the price/performance ratio. A room of more than 6,000 yuan is a standard room plus a swimming pool. Adding another room for a companion is a total of more than 10,000 to 10,000. The experience is not at the same level as the 10,000 yuan Edison tree house next door, not to mention the service up. Edison gave Evian more than a dozen bottles. I contacted the guest room depar**ent and said that Evian had sediment and it was not suitable for milking. They sent a box of mineral water directly. There was no need to negotiate for water like Rosewood. It took two days. Anyway, I am a person who loves to travel, so there is no other meaning in posting this review, I just hope that Rosewood can improve, after all, the experience this time is too eye-popping.

The ubiquitous artworks and small details are pleasing to the eye. The constant temperature swimming pool is beautiful and useful. It is not too comfortable to soak in the water and watch the sea in the winter sun. I ordered a 180 sea view suite, but I really love this room. Everywhere I sit is the sea view. Every time I have to decide which sofa and chair to lie on Will be confused. The hotel's food and beverages are quite appetizing, the Thai food is super delicious, the quality of the room delivery is quite good, there is a free minibar, and there is enough fruit, ah ~ fat but super satisfied ~ butler Elissa contacted before check-in, and responded quickly to needs after check-in ,thanks for your care! After staying in a hotel in Sanya, the first choice for Haitang Bay must be magnificent~

msg:The hotel facilities are good. The 180-degree sea view pool room is on the 6th floor, with a good view and average size. The exclusive terrace swimming pool is suitable for parent-child photography and floating breakfast. The actual temperature of the constant temperature facility can only reach about 28°. The swimming experience still needs to go to the infinity pool on the 13th floor. The automation function of the hotel room is good, from the curtains to the wireless charging to the screen-cast TV (the remote control needs to select the input signal as the device mirroring mode), which is more convenient. The snacks and drinks in the room are all available and free, which is highly praised. The buffet breakfast on the 13th floor is acceptable, with good taste and food quality, and it is worth trying. Needless to say, the Internet celebrity infinity pool on the 13th floor is the most invincible facility in the hotel that is worthy of a return visit. Whether it is taking pictures or leisure swimming, the landscape immersion is first-class, and it is highly recommended! The overall service of the hotel is good, the staff attitude is very good, and the response is very timely. In particular, the cleaning staff Zhuo Jiang'e is very nice and attentive. The WeChat housekeeper Olivia's service is also more proactive, and the bellboy is very professional and polite. The only shortcoming is that the manager and the hotel are stationed in the hotel at night. There are no temporary medical staff in the luxury hotel, and the guests cannot contact the manager for acute diarrhea. In this regard, the emergency plan should be summed up and improved well, so that it is truly a top luxury hotel with both software and hardware.

I am especially happy that the temperature measurement security brother at the hotel's mountain gate is very sunny and positive. Brought us a lot of laughter. Best wishes to us before staying at the hotel. Add a lot of rainbow to the whole travel itinerary!
Cons: The bedding was a little wrinkled when I first checked in. I think something is wrong

msg:Objective evaluation: poor service quality and poor hotel facilities. There are many photo spots in the hotel. For me, the most important thing is to have a comfortable vacation. I will not choose Sanya Rosewood again.

1⃣️ The hotel only has a public beach, and there are small vendors who come in and out at will, and sell to hotel guests; there are also many real estate agents, chasing and asking if they want to buy a house in Sanya. Even if there is no private beach, the experience is still pretty bad if unrelated people come in and out of the hotel to harass the guests.

2⃣️ The restaurant waiter does not take the initiative to pour water after taking a seat, and only serves drinks after urging; the plate will not be cleaned up after a long time. It's far from Park Hyatt's service.

3⃣️Only afternoon tea for two is provided, and it is informed that there is no afternoon tea set for one person, and only drinks and snacks that are not afternoon tea can be ordered. It's a bit outrageous that there is no place to drink afternoon tea (dessert + drink) alone in the three restaurants of the hotel.

4⃣️ The hotel rooms have no privacy, and you can basically see most of the hotel's balconies and floor-to-ceiling windows from your own room. Sunbathing and swimming can be seen.

msg:It's a card experience. I didn't want to write a review at first, but the butler asked me to help me write a review and said that I would like to give me a template, so I can only write one seriously.
This experience was not satisfactory. We are a family of three and know that this is not a parent-child hotel, so we did not experience it with the standards of a parent-child hotel.
First of all, the lobby is on the 14th floor. It is well furnished and looks very a**ospheric. I am quite satisfied. Originally, I booked a 180-degree sea view room. It was said that it was an upgrade for me. The 180 supreme sea view room, I thought it was a big upgrade, but I didn't think it was bad.
Next is the room, very very general, the room is not big, the only good thing is that you can see the sea from the bed. The minibar is free and can be refilled once a day.
The biggest highlight of this hotel is the infinity pool on the 13th floor. The scenery is really beautiful. In the afternoon, many people come upstairs to drink afternoon tea and take pictures. But this scenery is worth less than three thousand. Because there is almost no service.
My package includes welcome fruits and coconut greens every day. On the first day, there are welcome fruits and no coconut greens. I think it doesn’t matter. Forget it. On the second day, the housekeeper asked me if I still need fruit, and I said coconut greens. She said it would be delivered at night, and then there was no more. I was very surprised. I didn't have it on the first day, and I still didn't ask for it on the second day. I didn't take the customer's needs in mind at all.
I went to have breakfast in the morning, and when I came back, the cleaning aunt had already cleaned the room. After a while, the cleaning aunt didn't knock on the door, she swiped the card to open the door and said to send two bottles of water. Why didn't the cleaning aunt knock on the door? Very rude, basic rules are not followed.
The breakfast is average, there are not many varieties and the taste is average.
There is also an episode. In the swimming pool on the 13th floor, I stepped on a broken tile, and my foot bleeds on the spot. The waiter handled it in a timely manner and disinfected it. Because I brought the doll, the doll has been worried about whether it hurts or not. , In order not to worry the child, he kept comforting her and saying that it was all right. I don't know if the swimming pool staff reported this situation to the superiors after the incident, but it's okay for my adult to row, and the parents may be very nervous when the child encounters it.
So, there are more than 3,000 hotels here, and I feel totally disappointed.

After leaving the store, the deposit has not been refunded. I contacted Dasiy and immediately checked it for us and dealt with it. Trustworthy👍
The room is spacious. The only downside is that the washbasin is too small. In order to make room for my makeup, my boyfriend can only go to the small washbasin in the toilet to wash up🙇

The hotel room has an unusually comfortable large balcony facing the blue sea and Wuzhizhou Island. The room has free snacks and free drinks and toiletries. It is the favorite Italian brand bed The temperature-controlled infinity pool on the 13th floor is very large and comfortable. However, the hotel’s overall meal equipment is somewhat lacking compared to the room, and the buffet on the first floor is even a bit disappointing. The basic feature is that the standard hotel buffet is much weaker than one hotel and the Edison, and several other restaurants in the hotel. Looking at it, I don’t have much desire to try. In addition, the hotel’s glorious lobby and outdoor shops are empty, and it’s strange that there is no special retail space.

Special mention should be made that the quality of the dishes ordered at midnight in the hotel is still very good. A few dishes cost five hundred yuan, but I think it is excellent value for money, enough for three or four people to eat. And it tastes very good. It's a plus.

There are too many men and women who come here to take pictures and scratch their heads. Sometimes they will be awakened when they lie down and rest. They keep listening to how to take good pictures and so on... And the sea view room I ordered has been upgraded to 180 degrees. Sea view room, the view is indeed good, but the next night there was a man and woman in the room with a swimming pool downstairs. They started tossing and laughing in the swimming pool at two o'clock in the morning...because I felt bored in the house and opened the balcony door to sleep, midnight Was awakened by the man and woman, there was no response after calling the front desk, and I didn't sleep much all night. Because I had to stay for half a month, I changed the hotel decisively on the third day. But when I arrived at the new hotel, I felt that the sky pool over there was indeed a good one, but it was impossible to have both fish and bear paws. It is recommended that those who want a quiet rest do not choose this place. Those who like to take pictures can. And don’t choose the room next to the pool with the pool, and learn my lesson. I also praise Olivia Xiaozhong from the Customer Relations Depar**ent. I would like to praise and thank you again for solving the needs of the guests in a timely manner.

The infinity pool is outside, and inside is the Southeast Asian-style East Kitchen Restaurant. Will come back to live in magnificent again.

I received an enthusiastic call from the hotel staff on the way from the Sun Bay Park Hyatt Hotel to Rosewood Poly. When will the number of people arrive, contact her if there is any question, and ask about the experience of the stay several times during the check-in process. If you need it, please return it. After late check-out, I later found out that her name was Daisy, thank you! . After completing the check-in procedures, the sights on the 12th floor are suddenly clear, the whole Haitang Bay is panoramic, and the door is opened to make it more amazing. The 180-degree sea-view balcony, and a large square bathtub, open the balcony door and lie on the bed with the sea breeze blowing. Watching the sunrise, perfect. Wall crack recommends friends to experience.

It faces Wuzhizhou Island and you can see the sunrise from the bed. My wife not only booked the Zhi restaurant for me on her birthday, but also arranged small cakes for the room, which was full of ritual. The infinity pool on the thirteenth floor is also great.

msg:As an Internet celebrity hotel in Haitang Bay, the magnificent price cannot be underestimated. When the epidemic affected most hotels, they still stood firm when their business was bleak. But I want to say that it's all worth it.
This time I stayed in the 180 sea view room, and the moment I saw the balcony, I couldn't help but wow. As a person who lives in all the high-end hotels in Yalong Haitang, the magnificent room sea view is definitely the first. Opposite Wuzhizhou Island, the island was all the same, which was quite shocking. In particular, the group of villas designed by Poly was neat and consistent, and the group of villas that looked like abandoned village houses in Fairmont next door was compared to the group of villas.
In fact, there is not much to write about the Skyline Pool, so many Internet celebrity awl faces have come to punch in to show its excellence. Except that the wind is strong, the probability of rejecting the film is higher, and there are no disadvantages. This skyline swimming pool is the number one in Sanya. The Addison’s starry pool, the Westin total pool and the Crown’s 270 are indeed not as good as it.
As for breakfast, the category may not be as good as Ritz, and the water bar noodle stall is not as good as Edison, but it offers unlimited coconut drinks and Iberian ham. This is the configuration of many hotel executive lounges, except for Shanghai Jing’an Four Seasons. Have encountered breakfast in other hotels. And the chef of the egg stall is Alex, who created all-day dining restaurants in Shanghai Kerry and Pudong Kerry. The egg rolls rarely made in Chinese hotels can also be made for you, although I don’t really understand why such a powerful chef is here. Make eggs for breakfast...

🚗 Transportation: Haitang Bay is really convenient, it is very convenient for takeout and eating out

🍃Environment: The overall environment is very new and modern, and the sky lobby, sky infinity pool and bar are very popular~

🔔Service: Although it is not possible to make everyone smile and say hi in terms of service, the overall is still good. At the beginning, I drove to the door and didn't take the initiative to take the luggage to the room, but the little brother I met when I checked out was there Helping to press the elevator, the attitude of the pool brother is not tepid, not good or bad.
I think the shortcoming may be the breakfast. It's really not delicious. The first time I saw so many mango yogurt and mango jam, I can only say that I have a normal breakfast.

🧹Hygienic: The hotel is very clean from the lobby to the room. In terms of details, the bathtub is also spotless, and the outdoor sofa on the balcony is also neat. My sensitive skin and bedding have not caused redness.
But the big bathtub has only bath salt and no bath bar, which cannot satisfy the bubble bath🧼. Friends who want to enjoy it are recommended to bring their own.

🍃Environment: The overall environment of the hotel is very fashionable. There is an infinity pool downstairs and the big pool in the picture below, but the pool downstairs is closed at 18:00 in the evening. It is too early. Many hotels close at 21-22:00 The swimming pool, the infinity pool upstairs will also be closed when there is a typhoon.
It takes about 10 minutes to walk from the room to the beach. The view from the balcony is very good.

🔔Service: Before I check in, there will be a private butler plus V. Olivia will receive me. I will politely ask about my room requirements in advance. You can also find her if you have any needs after check in. It is in line with the thoughtfulness of a five-star hotel. I will take the initiative the next day. Asking if you want to check out late, the communication process is very comfortable, and you will not miss someone, which is a plus.

In general, it is more recommended for couples, girlfriends, friends or friends traveling alone, because there is no amu*****t facilities and the decoration is very trendy, so I don't think it is suitable for families and elderly people.

The 11th floor of the upgraded Supreme Ocean View Room is cleaned by the cleaning staff in a timely manner. There are not many people using the swimming pool, but the cleaning is quite clean, and the leaves are cleaned in time.

I prefer the large swimming pool on the first floor, and I can use the pusher next to it, which is quite interesting. The scenery on the 11th floor is really good. There are no beach chairs on the beach, so you can only step on the water. Be careful if there is a height difference. But the garden and the environment other than the beach are really good! Modern style

🔔Service: Elisa, the butler, is a very good person. If you add WeChat, you will answer all questions. On the last day, because of our schedule, we also postponed the refund to 14:00 for free, thanks! In addition, the management staff of the large swimming pool are also very good, patiently explaining how to use the propellers, and the restaurant service is also good.

Restaurant: Recommended! The fish restaurant is surprisingly delicious! After three days in Haitang Bay, the best Wenchang chicken was in the hotel. 108 servings of beef noodles for room service, but the taste is really good~!

recommend
[Romantic couple] Settling in, with fewer children, modern style, new decoration, and the square bathtub in the bedroom is also good~! Add one sentence: the bedding is so comfortable~!

The mood at the beginning of the day will be very good. Elisa, who was in charge of the reception, arranged small snacks very intimately, and the service was thoughtful and enthusiastic. Of course, I also experienced the hotel’s characteristic infinity swimming pool. The sun is particularly strong in the morning and the visual effects are great. I just go back indoors to cool off after playing for a while. Generally speaking, it is the most suitable hotel for vacation in my whole trip.

msg:I booked two rooms, one with a small swimming pool for more than 5,000, and one with a sea view room for more than 3,000. They are actually the same size. It's not a suite of one bedroom and one living room. I am now going out with two children aged 10 and 15, very embarrassed. It is very uncomfortable to open a room, and it is very expensive if it is a suite with a living room. The hotel hasn't adapted to customers having two children and three children
        The hotel’s housekeeper Olivia added me to WeChat in advance, and the service is better than Shangri-La. I'm sure it's not a robot. The hotel is actually some distance away from the sea, and there is a battery car to go to the beach. When you come to Haitang Bay, don't be obsessed with going to the beach. The opposite is Wuzhizhou Island. The water is very deep and the waves are big when going out from the sea. It is dangerous to go to the sea to wash feet and swim.
       The breakfast on the first floor of the hotel tastes good, with many varieties. Seeing that the Amway brand is holding a commendation meeting here, inflation, Amway’s meetings are of this grade. Fortunately, there are not many people. Without the feeling of the crowds in the big hotel, it is a place for vacation.
           The overall consumption in Sanya feels extremely high. Haitang Bay is full of tourists. When I went to Atlantis Water World, there were a lot of people, and I popped out without playing a project in three minutes. You can only play with your mobile phone in the room and soak in the hotel swimming pool.
       It was convenient when I left. I had a bowl of seafood noodles at the restaurant on the first floor of the hotel for 138 yuan. Refresh my cognition.
       The poor still don’t come to Sanya. As a person who lives by the sea, I don’t know why so many people choose to take a vacation here. Are there enough high-end hotels and expensive enough?
        I will accompany the children on the junior high school graduation trip. Here is high consumption. As a holiday by the sea, I will definitely not come again in the future. The money is arbitrary. Choose a hotel or choose Bailian Banyan Tree Capella

msg:Many reviews on Xiaohongshu before the booking said that Poly Rosewood had a bad service attitude, but this was not the case after check-in. From the young concierge who got off the bus at the hotel to the room service, they all acted well and rationally and responsively. In terms of restaurants, breakfast is served in the restaurants on the 13th floor and on the first floor. I personally think that the scenery on the 13th floor is better. Walking out of the hotel and heading towards the beach, the grilled restaurant is remarkable. The environment is elegant and the service is very good. The only drawback is that there may be mosquitoes outdoors. In terms of hotel room types, every room can see the sea. The privacy of the front sea view is definitely better than the side sea view. The rooms with swimming pool are up to the 7th floor. The infinity pool on the 13th floor is also a must. In short, a very nice hotel, worth staying.

The pao rice in the restaurant on the first floor is also amazing. There is no shortage of drinks, and the overall feeling is pretty good. The advantages have been praised by too many people. Let me talk about some regrets: the soundproofing of the room is still not perfect. We live on the 11th floor at night and it is too noisy; the access to the swimming pool must pass through the gate on the first floor. It’s too unsuitable for people to come and go. It is recommended to set up a special channel; there are too many companies and groups in the hotel, which lack the cleanness and leisure a**osphere of vacation, and the Internet celebrities who check in and take pictures on the full screen; the most weird thing is the butler service. I added a WeChat to the customer service, and I didn’t even see anyone. I don’t know if I misunderstood the butler service or the magnificent butler service is just a cloud service😓

In terms of service: Elisa, the butler, is very caring and has been paying attention to and following up on the needs of guests
The hotel’s breakfast and afternoon tea are also carefully made, and the pastry part does not lose Capella
There are also many dining options in the surrounding area. There are also good seafood restaurants within walking distance.

msg:For Rosewood in Sanya, I learned from a friend that she gave us various Amway on the day she arrived, and she also forced breakfast. Looking at the dazzling array of fruits and soap flakes with a 180° sea view, we also took this trip to Sanya. The last night was left to it.

The location is a little bit off, the Rosewood at the gate is not particularly conspicuous. It seems that there is a mansion number one on the right side of the door. I almost missed it. Driving all the way to the farthest is the entrance of the underground parking lot (scan the code every day Binding license plates can be free of parking fees).

Overall, there is a kind of hotel-style apar**ent. Check-in is on the 14th floor, and there are not too many people who check in. This time there was a big explosion of RP, and we were upgraded to a 180° luxury sea-view double room [礼花][礼花][礼花] with fireworks.
The decoration style of the room is very retro, and the layout is also very interesting. Many rooms are connected. The sofa on the balcony 🛋️ is not enough, it looks very good when taking soap tablets [Selfie].
The soft drinks and snacks in the refrigerator are all 🆓, I first brought myself a cup☕, each capsule coffee also has a corresponding brief, which is very considerate.

There is an open-air swimming pool and afternoon tea on the 13th floor. We ordered a set for two people. The taste is really average. People who love desserts like me think this dessert is so sweet, and if it is outdoors on a hot day, the mousse is very good. Almost paralyzed, the appearance is very ridiculous.

The most anticipated breakfast really did not disappoint us [Glutton] The restaurant is not very big, but the guests are not particularly large, so everyone is very orderly with their favorite food. The table layout is very exquisite, it feels like eating western food, there is a menu on the table, you can order fried dumplings, steamed buns, seafood porridge, etc. (it is estimated that the types will be changed frequently). The fruit section is really appetizing for me, there are too many options, and they are all fresh.

The hotel has a great beach. You can make an appoin**ent with the front desk to pick up and drop off. It will be delivered to a designated point, and then you will reach the beach just a few steps away. The sand is very fine, and the sea water is very clean. I actually saw some small ones being washed over.
Remember to take good sun protection, the sun is very powerful, after a few of us walked back and forth for two laps, everyone was dark.

overall:

1. Very quiet and comfortable, suitable for long stay
2. Breakfast is highly recommended, afternoon tea is not recommended
3. The infinity pool is great, very popular
4. Not suitable for bringing children, there are no amusement facilities
5. It is 6-7 kilometers away from the duty-free shop, but it takes only 10 minutes to drive.

In terms of hotel facilities, it is not suitable for parent-child or elderly people. The swimming pool may have been partially closed due to the epidemic. The hotel is generally playable. It takes a large circle from the elevator to the swimming pool, and the sign is not very clear. There are not many places to check in in the hotel, only the Sky Pool can check in.
Finally, the service was staggering. On the way to the gym, a person who was not wearing a uniform suddenly asked "Where to go!" He didn't say hello to us, but asked loudly. It felt like a hotel manager, very rude... Another episode, Breakfast is over at 11 o’clock. The service staff may want to remind us that if we need more, we can take a little more. They are about to take the meal. It may be nervous or the training is not in place. Let us eat quickly 😂, they are going to take it, on the spot Almost laughed rough. The other is room service. It’s already turned on. Do not disturb. I still knock on the door in the morning. One morning I didn’t answer and opened the door... It was quite speechless...
Of course, the service is also good. The waiters like chophouse are very enthusiastic, the food is also delicious, the bread before the meal is absolutely perfect, do not step on thunder. The gym is watched by staff, and they can be found if necessary. They are very enthusiastic. In addition, I feel that the hotel is doing well.

這次入住，三亞保利瑰麗酒店的賓客體驗經理Nanncy服務簡直是棒！入住後為了提升我們的幸福感，特意做了一些安排。熱情周到的服務，讓人彷彿置身於一個無比温暖的懷抱中。酒店的客房也在入住後為我們安排了浪漫的佈置，用心照顧每一位客人，讓人感受到家的温馨與舒適。

可惜入住的第二天晚上，夜深人靜的時候，突然一陣歡呼打破了寧靜，是婚禮的客户們歡呼暢飲，讓我們被吵醒了。徹夜難眠。不過，在這一刻，我才意識到，原來幸福和喧鬧可以如此親密地相伴💑。

或許有人會説，婚禮客户們有些過於熱鬧了，打擾了我們的休息。其實確實是的，真的是睡不着太吵了。但是，回想起那一刻，我卻覺得這場喧鬧彷彿是對幸福情侶生活最真實的註解。

科學表明，幸福的感覺源自內心的感知和外在環境的互動。而在三亞保利瑰麗酒店，這種幸福感在每一個細節中得到了體現。無論是迷人的景色，還是貼心的服務，都讓人感受到一種前所未有的幸福。

雖然還是有一些小插曲，但是總體都還是非常滿意的，希望酒店以後對婚禮客人也做一下約束，比如晚上11點後就要撤場等等，下次有時間還是會再回來的，期待酒店的改善。

這次來三亞訂了三家酒店 分別是瑰麗 東方文華和嘉佩樂，瑰麗的價格適中，並不是最貴的，所以本以為應該和內地五星級酒店的服務、環境差不多，但是入住之後驚訝的發現，太讓人驚喜了。
首先是服務方面，酒店賓客關係部的Annie加了我的微信詢問入住體驗，然後非常爽快的給我免費升級了泳池房，親自上門給我拿行李，還準備了椰青和歡迎水果，發來了活動詳情，最後也幫我延遲退房了，很多溝通的小細節都讓我覺得超級貼心，有回家的感覺。
其次就是環境，無論是園林還是房間裏環境都非常有自己的特色，又不失設計感，熱帶氣息體現在方方面面，但是沒有很多小蟲子，應該是下了功夫的！主草坪和13樓的無邊泳池也非常適合拍照。同時對於年輕人來説，瑰麗沒有太多小孩子，會有更好的居住體驗。
最後就是酒店的早餐和水上早餐啦，早餐有當地特色酸粉和特色水果，水上早餐很適合拍照，要提前一天訂會送到房間裏，味道也很棒！
入住的第一間酒店就有這麼不錯的體驗，壓力給到剩下兩家啦哈哈哈哈，總結一下就是，不虛此行，下次來還會定瑰麗來度假！

環境：瑰麗的環境沒得説，雖然此次沒來得及體驗私享沙灘看海吹海風，但不用去體驗也會知道會是很好的體驗，酒店是有小擺渡車接送到沙灘的；
服務：我的管家是Nanncy，雖然未着麪，但的確是非常無微不至的管家，淺看了一下朋友圈應該是剛入職不久的新夥伴，但上手的速度很快了，對酒店整體的服務和活動都很清晰。對緊急和特殊事件的處理及應對，也的確對得上前東家頒發的年度優秀經理。
事件：把本次入住中發生的特殊case拿出來跟大家分享。因最後一天假期想要整體放鬆便託Nanncy預約了當日的水療服務，選擇了感官之旅套餐（包含贈餐），結束水療後問到贈餐事項水療師表示不知情，詢問前台接待，答覆是1）與攜程的200元額度不可重複使用；2）贈餐需提前24h預約，但實際在平台亦或是房間的宣傳中並未提到需提前預約的事項，且贈餐本就屬於套餐服務中的一項，何來優惠重複一説？Nanncy快速瞭解整個事件後，第一時間告知了是內部協同出現問題，的確在一些服務事項上酒店考慮的不夠周全，第二會上升這個case給上面進行改進，避免未來持續出現該類體驗問題，第三迅速辛苦後廚備齊簡餐，並留我在美容房中休息。以上，為Nanncy妥貼的處理點贊，也感謝水療中心的各位工作人員耐心服務。

首先，我想説的是，酒店的工作人員非常友好和熱情。他們總是樂於幫助我們解決問題，並且提供出色的服務。此外，酒店的食物和服務也非常出色。我們嘗試了酒店的餐廳和酒吧，食物美味可口，飲品也非常好喝。

&&酒店大堂Sky Lobby位於酒店的14層，在周邊酒店中是最高的大堂，網眼看去美麗的夜景盡收眼底，遠處的亞特蘭蒂斯酒店和紅樹林度假酒店顯而易見。&&大堂以鯨魚的尾巴為元素、配以海洋元素的地毯來演繹空間，展現城市對於自然以及大海的依戀。酒店有兩百餘間全海景客房，客房全部面朝大海，無論入住哪一間，都能欣賞到美麗的海景，對面就可以看到蜈支洲島。

總之，三亞保利瑰麗酒店是一次非常愉快的體驗，我相信這裡會成為很多人的度假首選之地。

酒店的服務很好，員工們都非常熱情周到，有私人管家服務，社恐人基本靠微信能解決所有事，他們都能迅速解決。
無邊泳池和酒吧真的很好拍，服務員小姐姐不忙的時候會幫忙拍照，超級有耐心，調酒師也很健談，酒的味道不錯。

早餐品類很多，口味也不錯，中西餐都有，而且在13樓，如果坐在靠窗邊就可以直接觀海。到榜樣還會有日落小食套餐（酒水暢飲，還有一些炸物，甜品，水果等）一邊欣賞夕陽，一邊品鑒美食。
可能因為是淡季過來，人不是特別多，所以每一處的服務都很及時，走到哪裡都有服務人員打招呼做引導，“”也超級貼心，入住的前，中，後都會給到很多温馨問候和提示，有什麼需求和“”發微信都是第一時間回覆且安排上，還贈送了一些非常實用的小禮品，正好讓我後面行程都能用上。
亮點的無邊泳池是這次旅行中的最愛，不怕曬的話可以中午左右去，幾乎沒什麼人，可以暢遊，而且可以在泳池裡欣賞到最開闊視野的全海景，非常喜歡泳池最裡麪的小涼亭，私密性很好，而且不會很曬，有海風的話就不會太熱。

酒店的224間客房全部面朝大海，我這次入住的是熱賣的
180度全海景户型，正面眺望蜈支洲島，海上的運動生活一覽無餘，讓這片海更有層次，更有豐富的美感。客房內的設計有一種現代的復古質感，寬大的步入沉浸式浴缸直麪窗外的海，復古的地燈和傢俱隨手一拍都是藝術大片。
而且房間在佈局上也極為新穎，房門結合橡木與帆布，推開進入旋即感受徐徐海風。地毯圖案由當地民族特色線條演化，不同深淺顏色的處理使空間呈現的元素多元卻又和諧。Frette 浴袍和寢具，Lorenzo Villoresi訂製頂級洗浴備品、戴森吹風機、Bose 藍牙音箱、一應俱全的迷你酒吧、還有開夜床送的精緻禮物，都無時不刻的彰顯着這裏的頂級品質。
從酒店走向大海會路過主泳池和諾大的草坪，踱步在這熱帶雨林風貌的花園裡，有一種愛麗絲漫遊仙境之感。感謝賓客關係部Ryan的貼心服務

再説酒店設施。房間乾淨衞生，設施齊全，180度的全海景絕對是個加分項，在陽台上面朝大海打兩段八段錦別提多通透了。園林不算大，勝在小巧舒適。最大的亮點自然在公區，13樓的天際泳池，空中大堂旋轉樓梯早已名聲在外無需多言。更有很多藝術陳列裝置，多留心慢慢看。這些有意思的地方值得多住上些時日慢慢去發現。去往沙灘很方便，我喜歡步行，5分鐘就到，酒店也有電瓶車接送。

早餐自助食材新鮮健康，每日有單點菜式提供，更有美景佐餐開啟元氣滿滿的一天。漁家中餐廳推薦招牌糟粕醋雙人火鍋和香酥東山羊，味道好，量大，還有小姐姐幫忙剝蝦殼。

每天游泳，健身，陪着老媽，吃吃喝喝，看海發呆，謝謝保利瑰麗讓我們度過了一次安心舒心開心的假期。這是個能把人心留下來的地方。期待下次再見咯。

      因為家裡人身體不是很好，所以過了年來三亞度假順便調養一下，內地天氣還是比較冷。剛到三亞是在萬豪住了兩天，萬豪是低樓層也有植被遮擋，氣温比較高，總會出汗，身體也好了很多。（來三亞之前就準備多換幾個酒店體驗一下）第三天換到保利瑰麗酒店以後，是高樓層，面朝大海的房間大概是17樓。入住以後就發現風挺大的。在陽台吃了個午餐，坐一會沒多久就覺得有些冷，開始咳嗽，於是便打電話和工作人員溝通，想要退掉房間。工作人員都很負責，立即把情況反映給了當天的值班經理，一邊聽説我們反饋冷，也詢問要不要換低樓層的房間，並派人帶我們看了5樓的房間（有些記不清是幾樓了）因為二樓三樓低樓層都是泳池房。但是我們感受過還是認為風有些大，便告知還是想退房。
       我們便在回到到房間繼續等待，期間也在聯繫攜程客服。值班經理打電話確認我們一定要退房，也在積極聯繫客服，一邊為我們惋惜，説這個房費退多少總是有些不合適，也不想客人有什麼不開心，如果可以還是想要我們留下來。因為客服那邊遲遲沒有消息，經理主動到我們房間，説帶我們去2樓看一看，氣温或許高一些也沒那麼大的風。沒想到2樓確實好很多，一出電梯就發現温度比高樓層暖很多，房間裏陽台也看了因為有一些樹木，沒什麼風，便同意換下來了。經理告知，要在打掃一下房間，晚點會有工作人員幫我們一起拿下行李。從始至終，所有服務人員都是禮貌又熱情，體貼又周到，其實我們要退房也跟酒店沒關係，是自己的原因，其實都有點不好意思但卻收穫了這樣讓人如沐春風的服務，非常感謝！
      換好房間以後，經理（忘記詢問經理叫什麼名字了，是位漂亮的小姐姐）主動安排加好了小床和2台暖風機，還貼心地詢問需不要薑茶，得到肯定的回答，也很快送了2大壺保温壺的薑茶到房間。讓人從心暖到身，哈哈哈。讓人再次忍不住誇讚這裏的服務，尤其是值班經理的耐心和熱情，真正的賓至如歸！雖然衹住了一天後來就回去萬豪衹至離島，但保利瑰麗酒店及服務人員確實讓人印象深刻，時隔幾個月還記憶猶新。

服務：預訂顯示有入住歡迎水果，但不會主動給，問到客房服務端了一份過來，保鮮膜都沒有。早餐的服務員沒有一個會笑，感覺苦大仇深的樣子。住過倫敦瑰麗，巴黎瑰麗，態度沒有一個比這個傲嬌的。
設施：裝修和設備中規中矩，同價位酒店中不算出眾，房間景觀還是不錯。
   可能因為是網紅酒店，網紅真的好多🤣長時間佔據無邊泳池和旋轉樓梯拍照，旋轉樓梯每次路過都有在拍照，沒有一次走上去過。親子家庭不適合，體驗很不好，不會再入住了🤪

msg:能帶娃住，睡得很舒服的酒店，整體度假感一般。
優點：
①管家服務（不過我是泳池房），響應很及時。
②基本滿足需求，送了我一個大人早餐，還在旺季的三亞給我延遲了2h退房。
③早餐廳雖小但是真的挺好吃，師傅的手藝很不錯，小熊軟糖收買了孩子的心，超讚！
④整體的洗護包比較精緻，梳子值得誇一下，送的沙灘包雖然質量一般（拎個單反就漏了），但勝在好看，還送了一個帆布袋，也挺好看的。
⑤親子部分，小馬桶和登高台是基本該有的，送了個小熊是意外之喜，娛樂中心的親子項目的小姐姐很nice，即使錯過時間去了，也會幫忙照顧（就是有點小）。
⑥漁家餐廳還不錯，如果要多吃幾天，可以充儲值卡8折，性價比就上來了。
覺得還能做得更好的地方：
①響應速度：不知道是不是寒假了，響應很快，但是送東西賊慢。除了迎進門那會特別熱情之外，剩下的服務人員感覺比不上成熟人又多的希爾頓。
②公共部分：酒店沒有沙灘，公共沙灘全是馬糞，基本上別指望下樓就去海灘躺着玩。
③花園沒有做好驅蚊，下午躺了一會全是蚊子。
④健身房比較小，不像五星級該有的健身房。
⑤無邊泳池温度不高，樓頂大風簡直冷到下不了水。冬天來可能無法體驗。
整體上是家精緻的酒店，不是那種大度假酒店，但是管家Ella還是很貼心，給酒店加了不少分。
最後，送的旅拍態度很差，但效果比亞龍灣的好一些，認真調教很出片，就是總感覺像我欠了他幾萬塊。_ _

msg:服務：超級nice的入住體驗！特別是酒店管家泡泡 && 的貼心安排，在入住之前就已經對接上並進行了旅行嚮導，房間也贊！特別值得一提的是，入住第二天浴缸燈故障，酒店第一時間給我配了附加光源，整個陽台就很温馨了。

衞生：出行總有重複消毒的習慣，酒店也配合多次對浴缸進行了消毒，很安心，其它基礎衞生本就很OK

環境：這次入駐的01户型，視野非常好呢！

設施：帶地下車庫，個人認為是優於亞特蘭蒂斯的，畢竟每次出行，入車的第一體感，還是需要舒適温度，還有接駁車去海邊，並配備了人字拖鞋🩴

如果非要提些建議，就是洗手池邊的白色木質隔斷沒有和枱麪連接起來，時間久了會有陳舊性污跡不好打理，且容易生黴菌。

設施：住的泳池房，坐在室外躺椅上可以看到正對面的蜈支洲島，風景很好很舒服。泳池也挺乾淨的，這個天氣水被太陽曬的暖融融的，很舒服。室內有超大的浴缸，可以一邊看海一邊泡澡。迷你吧很棒！不過洗漱用品是大瓶裝的，而且卡在牆上不太方便按。床品很軟。


衞生：還不錯，每天打掃兩次，開夜床的時候也會稍微打掃一下。


環境：無邊泳池真的很美～

唯一不太好的就是早餐的工作人員不是很熱情。

而在酒店內，賓客可以盡享人少愜意的度假時光。酒店設有多個休閑區域，無論是是在陽光充足的泳池邊享受陽光浴，還是在健身房裡揮灑汗水，又或者是子在咖啡廳品味一杯香濃的咖啡，都能讓人感受到度假的愜意。

酒店的客房服務也非常周到，提供了免費的迷你吧飲料。賓客體驗經理@@也個性化服務，為我們更換無糖可樂。此外，酒店還注重環保和可持續發展，採用了多種綠色環保設施，房間陽台門一打開，空調會自動關閉。這裏讓賓客在享受奢華的同時，也能為地球的環境貢獻一份力量。

방에 들어갔을 때 나는 고급스러운 인테리어와 안락한 가구에 매료되었다.그 방에는 멋진 바다 전망을 볼 수 있는 커다란 발코니가 있다.아침 식사는 매일 엄선되어 신선한 과일부터 따뜻한 커피까지 모든 것이 완벽하다.

숙박을 하는 것 외에도, 호텔은 다른 많은 흥미 있는 활동들을 제공한다.나는 호텔 내 스파에서 긴장을 풀고 최고급 진료의 혜택을 맛볼 기회가 있었다.훌륭한 헬스클럽과 야외 수영장도 있어서 운동하고 수영할 수 있는 기회를 준다.또한, 호텔의 직원들도 매우 우호적이고 전문적이며, 그들은 항상 최고의 도움과 지원을 제공합니다.

전반적으로 볼 때 싼야 글로리 호텔은 내가 이번 하이난다오 여행에서 눈에 띄는 곳 중 하나였다.이 호텔의 뛰어난 서비스와 시설은 당신이 이곳에서 좋은 기억을 남기게 할 것이다.만약 당신이 해남도에서 휴가를 보내려고한다면, 산야구이호텔을 강력 추천합니다!나는이 호텔에 다시 투숙하여 더욱 아름다운 해남도를 탐험하기를 잠시도 지체하지 않았다.게객 관계부의 ryan 서비스는 아주 좋다

msg:酒店很大，空間上不會侷促感。
訂的房間正對蜈支洲島，海景視野開闊。
酒店服務迴應及時，還配備了管家。
管家Nanncy服務細緻，迴應及時。
酒店有沙灘，可以和家人去踩沙玩水。入住前買瓶驅蚊蟲液，晚上沙灘有很多蟲子。
酒店到蜈支洲島直線距離很近，可以考慮開通酒店的船上島，這樣住店客人應該更多吧😊

msg:作為一個度假酒店，公區太少，連自己的海灘都沒有，整體裝修設計也非常一般，算是瑰麗的下限了吧……早餐收費很高，但能選的食物少，也很難吃……總的來説很不值，和同價位艾迪遜相比，完全不在一個體驗級別，差的太遠。
唯一還行的，就是房間，但大老遠到這裏可不是貓房間裡頭的。
