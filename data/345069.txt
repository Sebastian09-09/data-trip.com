msg:the hotel is in a good location, in a beautiful park.  however, there are many weak points.  SPA was closed, 2 swimming pools were also closed.  There was no information about this when booking.  There should have been a discount for that.  There are also too few deck chairs available.  Breakfast was the same every day, the fruit juice was of poor quality and eggs and pancakes took a long time to prepare, it was not adapted to the large number of guests.  Overall, the price was too high for the service offered

But especially Beck helped us a lot, resolving all our doubts or questions. He was great for us to spend a great time. The breakfast at the hotel is really good, with a lot of options ( noodles, guangdong steam, a bakery room‚Ä¶). The hotel has 4-5 pools, one of them with slides. And there was a foam show everyday 17-18h. The beach , 5 minutes walking was wonderful: clean, almost empty. What we also liked was all the plants around the hotel. There were also a hainan restaurant and Chongqing hotpot. We are looking forwards to come back very soon! We loved this hotel!

msg:The outside area of the hotel is nice, and the beach is beautiful.
The breakfast is good, and suitable for both Chinese and foreigners. 
People who work at the hotel are smiley and friendly, especially the front desk lady (good English if you have trouble speaking Chinese), she upgraded my room, because the previous one was mouldy and had a damp smell, but still... The new room had the same problem, but a beautiful view though.
The only and main problem is the cleanliness of the room. 
The floor, the bed(damp bedding with a strange smell) 
, the carpet(full of people's hair and stains, impossible to step on without slippers), and even bath robes (with fresh foundation stains)are just shockingly not clean.
There are bed bugs that bite at night time as well.
Tried to cancel my booking, but it wasn't possible because of the type of my booking.
Anyways if you stay 99% of your time outside everything is OK, the only problem is sleeping time when you need to stay in the room.

msg:I booked four nights stay at the Wanda Realm hotel with my partner over Christmas for a getaway. Trip.com had a deal where breakfast + either lunch/dinner for two was also included. I paid 4036 RMB by wechat for this on Trip.com.
When checking in, the hotel took a further 6000 RMB ‚Äúpayment and deposit‚Äù (so to check in I needed to have 10036 RMB in my account). I was assured that I would be refunded my deposit after checking out. Quite frankly this is an astronomically ridiculous amount of money for a hotel of such poor quality.
The customer service representatives at reception were truly awful. The receptionist (who could speak some English) absolutely refused to commune with me, but instead only spoke to my Mandarin-speaking partner. At this point they told us the ONLY option for lunch or evening meal was the on-site hot pot restaurant. There are no other alternatives such as a buffet ‚Äúbecause of covid‚Äù.
When we got to our room, the floor had a layer of dust and hair on it like I‚Äôd never seen in a hotel before. We asked for it to be cleaned, and it took hours before someone knocked on the door. 
The refrigerator in the room wasn‚Äôt working. We asked to have it fixed or replaced, at which point reception tried to feed us some BS saying ‚Äúit keeps things fresh, not cold‚Äù. It‚Äôs a bloody fridge, it‚Äôs primary function is to keep things cold. Some time later a handyman came up to ‚Äúfix it‚Äù. He flicked a switch at the back, and said it‚Äôs done. It changed nothing.
With frustration growing, we decided to go back to the reception area. I saw a Starbucks sign so wanted to grab a coffee. At the ‚Äúcoffee counter‚Äù with Starbucks logos, there was no one and it was filthy. Asking reception what time they open, they said 2pm (at was already 2:30pm). We wandered back over as a man appeared from behind the counter. We asked for coffee, but they had no coffee beans.
On our first nights stay, we decided to go for hot pot, where at the restaurant they give very limited (and I mean very limited) options for those on the half-board package. They were missing a number of items from the menu, but at least did try to offer an alternative.
All of this was on day one.
To be fair, the hotel on day two offered to change our room. My partner inspected the room, and said it wasn‚Äôt worthwhile to change. 
The next day we went to breakfast, which was actually really good. Funnily enough it was buffet - something the hotel said they couldn‚Äôt do for evening meals ‚Äúbecause of covid‚Äù. Go figure.
We didn‚Äôt eat at the hotel hotpot on the 2nd night because no one wants hotpot everyday.
On our 3rd night, we went back for more hotpot, but this time the restaurant had so little available on the menu, the waitress told us it wasn‚Äôt worth eating there. This was the straw that broke the camels back. After 3 nights of our four nights stay, we asked for a refund on our 4th night, and we were going to check out early.
After hours talking to Trip.com customer service and with agreement from hotel reception, a refund was agreed. We checked out on Dec 26th.
Today (27th December), trip.com just called me to say that the hotel had gone back on their agreement that they now were not going to refund the final night stay.

To summarise:
The room was good, but dirty on arrival. Once cleaned was very nice. The fridge didn‚Äôt work. The shower head was damaged, and the shower hose in the bathtub didn‚Äôt work. 
Breakfast was very enjoyable.
The hotpot restaurant was terrible, mainly because their menu was unable to be fulfilled. 
Customer service is shockingly bad.
Of the two times we went to the filthy coffee counter, they either didn‚Äôt have coffee beans or didn‚Äôt have milk.

My recommendation: stay away. Pay more and go somewhere else.

The majority of our stay were next to the pool and even though there are many and big pools, it was a bit of a concern as some pool tiles were missing and there were some nasty screws poking out of the wooden deck to the pool. The room was also a bit older than we expected. There was no shade on the beach either (and no swimming allowed), but from sunset it was beautiful and a lively beach to walk on!
Even with the concerns, it did not affect our stay too much and we still enjoyed sunbathing for our full 5 days stay!

msg:We booked 5 nights at the Double Tree but ended up staying only 1 and then moving to another hotel. The reception area is welcoming, breezy, and bright and James at the front desk is extremely helpful and friendly, and the beach is massive and gorgeous, but unfortunately those are the only good things I can say. The pools were dirty and had broken tile in several places. The room was dark and dirty, the floor felt dirty under my bare feet, the bedding felt damp, the shower leaked, the sink was clogged, there were moldy areas that had obviously been just painted over, the refrigerator in the mini bar did not work, I could smell cigarette smoke and hear yelling all night, the TV was small and unclear. The property as a whole just seemed very old and quite neglected...it didn't have a resort "feel" to it. The breakfast was crowded with limited choices and workers seemed unable to keep up with clearing away the tables. There were a few times throughout our stay that I phoned the front desk or asked a staff member for help with something and nobody (except James) spoke English or was able to help me. We left after our first night and thankfully were able to get our money refunded as our stay was quite unsatisfactory. I really dislike writing such a negative review but I must say I have stayed at other DoubleTrees around the world with great satisfaction and was pretty shocked at the low quality of this location. I hope in the future they can up-skill their staff, renovate the rooms and other areas of the property, and improve on the whole.

He ignored me when I spoke to him and just checked in. The phone in the room was broken, the pillow was moldy, there were mosquitoes and cockroaches in the room, and the cockroaches were still alive... The service staff who came to deal with the problem also had no service awareness and knew nothing when asked.

Every child will pass by. There are many children. The service staff has a sister whose child is in college. She is very gentle and patient with the children. I like it very much. It is especially easy for parents to sit in the air-conditioned room and watch the children's activities. I stayed for 3 days and left early and returned late every day. I took the time to feel it in the hotel. It feels like a hotel in Thailand. The breakfast is delicious. The restaurants inside are delicious. I have eaten them all.

Standing on the first floor of the hotel, the overall hotel environment is not bad, but when you enter the room, the door handle is very broken, and every room looks like someone has pried it. , the water bar in the room every day has four bottles of mineral water and four bottles of Coke, Sprite and the like in the refrigerator, which are enough. There are so many people queuing for breakfast, and the food is quite satisfactory. The biggest problem is that the pests are not removed. I was there on the first night I have bitten more than 10 betel nut bags and cannot get rid of the medicine no matter how I apply it. This is similar to what the previous reviewers said. But after all, it is the cheapest hotel nearby, and the swimming pool water is quite cold. I already caught a cold after getting in the water. Mainly because it is windy here, so that's about it. The children's playground is enough for children around 3 years old to play for a while. I will not stay here next time, but because the price is cheap, 632 per night in the off-season, I gave it a 4-star rating.

For example, there is no exhaust system and it is difficult for moisture to escape after taking a shower. The deluxe sea view twin room we wanted was as big as the room and had a really good view. The clear blue sea was very eye-catching. There will be sea breeze blowing at night, so you still need to cover yourself with a quilt at night in January. Restaurant and swimming pool are equipped. The bath water is very comfortable. The service is very good, Jingtian drinking water is free, and snacks and drinks in the refrigerator are also free.

msg:A hotel with a high cost-effectiveness. If the quality and environment of the buffet breakfast were a little higher, it would certainly be better. However, the price is here (Westin is better, and the price is of course higher, but our Wanda also has its own advantages. I personally think that it is still a cost-effective one). Those who pursue cost-effectiveness can rush in and don't step on thunder. Although the hotel is not particularly new, the room is quite large, and the activities arranged for children are also very good. It would be better if the small video games were updated and enriched (but the small video game equipment is a bit old, which saves money for the old mother, haha). The small restaurant on the beach is also good, cost-effective, delicious, and the environment is not bad. I see that there is also a plaque of Chinese time-honored brand. Of course, it would be better if the hygiene is improved, especially the bathroom in the small restaurant. The service of the ladies is very good and they are very friendly to children. In short, it is still a hotel with a high cost-effectiveness and it is worth staying again.

There is no worse room than this one. The balcony is pitifully small. The equipment is old. If you want to save money, remember to buy mosquito repellent. It will not make you unforgettable. If you have rhinitis, don't go there. Save some medicine. The dinner buffet is not worth the price. The steaks in any nearby hotel buffet are more delicious than this one. You have to queue up for the buffet in the morning, just like going to a market in the countryside. The key is to see that the floor is visible in many places. If you don't feel sick, you can choose this one.

Hygiene: The swimming pool in the park is very clean and can be opened for swimming.
Service: This time I came to Sanya and chose to stay here for the last two days. On the day of check-in, the front desk upgraded me to a poolside room. When I finally left, the hotel even sent a text message to ask about the items left in the room. It was very considerate. Thank you very much.

In fact, I urged the front desk to check that it had been cleaned. I was not satisfied with the check-in and even after entering the room. There is a musty smell, and there are used or unused pillowcases hanging on the bathtub. I highly suspect that the room was only half cleaned, not to mention the service. It basically takes an hour to order room service. Children's activities need to be done by themselves. I found that no one will tell you that you need to make a reservation one day in advance. In fact, there is no verification at all. You have to discover everything by yourself. In short, I feel very bad. From the time I checked in, I received bad reviews and no service.

I gave her my check-in ID card at the beginning. She also asked me for her ID card, and it took her a long time to upgrade her room. It took her a long time to check the room, and it took more than an hour to clean a room. Finally, when she checked out, a male waiter took a long time to issue an invoice.

msg:The cheapest and lowest priced among the first-line beach hotels.
environment:
As soon as you enter the lobby, you can feel the strong old-fashioned decoration style. It seems that it was formerly a DoubleTree by Hilton, and you can feel the same layout style as soon as you enter the room.
The guy at the front desk was very nice and helped me upgrade my room to a superior garden view, where I could see the swimming pool, lawn and a little bit of the sea. The rooms in Building 5 we stayed in were relatively old, all in red and black tones. The rooms were relatively large and there were no mosquitoes. There may be mosquitoes in the restaurant and swimming pool.
FOOD:
I transferred from Sanya from Lingshui because of the rich breakfast, but I was a little disappointed. The breakfast was mediocre, the bread was not fresh, the noodle soup was watered down, and you had to queue up for pancakes and fruits, but they were not delicious either. No longer crispy.
Serve:
I was given a lot of activity coupons, but they didn't explain how to use them clearly. I called the front desk to ask if I needed to make an appoin**ent, but I wasn't told that people in the city that never sleeps need to go after 2 o'clock. I originally wanted to go to the Flying Cinema, but the time the next day was not suitable.
There are always three knocks from the next room at night, and there are sounds at 1 or 2 in the morning. It was knocked again at 8 or 9 o'clock in the morning. After breakfast, I went to check out and told the front desk to ask the staff to pay attention.
There are two swimming pools. The pool service staff is very good. When the water gun ran out of power, he let us play for free.

I just went to experience the third-party service for a travel shoot and didn‚Äôt dare to go to others for fear that it would be a trap. As a rational consumer, I just want to give a bad review to the third-party service. First of all, the travel photographer has a very bad attitude. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because we don‚Äôt have one. If you buy the promoted package, you will be given five tickets for free. After half a day, I tried to find ways to get you to charge more for the service. In the end, I was really embarrassed when I was sold. I could only recommend that my friends who would come later choose third-party services provided by the hotel and choose carefully. It is best not to go there.

The location of the hotel in Haitang Bay is very good, the beach is soft and the sea view is great, the staff in each position of the hotel are well-trained and responsive, the breakfast variety is rich, exceeding expectations, there are several freshly made open stalls, a lot of dishes, and the quality of coffee is good , Western food bags are all freshly baked, in short, it retains the quality of many old five-star hotels, which is incomparable to new hotels. The evening's complimentary bundle of joy was plentiful. The dinner buffet includes barbecue and food, which is very rich. At the same time, the minibar is free, and I was given more purified water because I like to make tea. The swimming pool is very clean, and the garden is well maintained.

The front desk clerk gave me a look. The room is even worse. As soon as you enter the room, there are bathrobes for Shangbo guests on the bed. It feels like a room from 20 years ago. The facilities in the room are old, the room smells bad, and the swimming pool downstairs is filthy. Stay here for the last time.

msg:On the day of check-in, I was a little unhappy because of the problem of the bed. Ctrip customer service immediately resolved it and upgraded the room. In fact, I still have feelings for this hotel. I stayed here for the first time in 15 years, and I will choose this hotel almost every time I come to Hainan. Because breakfast and bedding are really cost-effective. Pros: The breakfast is rich, the bedding is very comfortable and it is Jin Keer's mattress, and the swimming pool is also good. Bring drinks and snacks. The restaurant in the hotel is also delicious. Sent scenic spot tickets. There is an exclusive activity room for children with tax-free discounts. Disadvantages: Only one swimming pool is open at night, which is a bit rare, and the beach is surrounded by trees. The location for watching the sea is not well planned. The furniture in ordinary garden view rooms is a bit old and damaged, and the TV is also small. Need to upgrade the facilities. It is recommended to stay in the Executive Garden View Room. The interior will be much better.

I called again to remind them, and half an hour later, disposable slippers were delivered. After chasing afterward, I finally delivered brand new children's rubber slippers. The next day I called the front desk to inquire about how to turn off the night light. I promised to send someone over, but no one came. In short, I can do whatever I want when I check in. It is too difficult to add something. I saw a picture on the minibar table in the room little ant

Hygiene: It looks clean, but the sheets and quilts may be left there as long as no one lives there after the day is returned, and they are never changed. The sheets and pillows are full of ants and various bugs. I don‚Äôt know if the hotel is not sealed well, or In the last stay, there may have been food spills that were not cleaned up.
Environment: The overall environment is good, the beach is good, but the hotels over there share a beach, any one can use it, the room environment is poisonous, as long as the air conditioner is turned on, there will be noise, as evidenced by the video. However, at 7 o'clock in the morning, there are warbling birds, and they sing continuously. Be careful if you have low sleep quality. This hotel is not soundproof, and you can hear people walking in the corridor clearly.
Service: The service is impressive. After finding the ants, I called the front desk to deal with them. The waiting people couldn't come if they fell asleep. There was a wave of people before the check-in, and they waited for more than 20 minutes. Finally, to sum up, I came to Sanya by car. I have lived in 3-star, 4-star, B&Bs, chained and non-chained along the way. This is the worst accommodation. The most important thing when I come out to play is to rest. As a 5-star hotel It is unacceptable for a hotel chain of a big brand, the only bad review for the 20-day itinerary. It is such a hotel that the gold and jade are on the outside and the inside is broken.

msg:Girls are advised not to stay in this hotel, there is **! Unsafe!

Ctrip customer service said that boys can't accept it either!

The first bad review of Ctrip Diamond members!

Security and privacy are not guaranteed at all!

I have never been so scared and afraid!

There is ** in the hotel! The underwear (underwear) on the clothes drying rack was touched by the male staff when cleaning the room and the clothes rack was changed and hung again! Disgusting! **!

1 On the first day of staying in the hotel, I returned to the room and found the empty ice cream box in Figure 1, and a stranger entered the room!

2 There were blood stains on the changed sheets! Disgusting!

3 There was a sound when I entered the room at around 10 o'clock on the fourth night. I thought there was **. After 15 minutes, the staff finally came. The doorbell was broken and rang for 45 minutes. It was so angry! 45 minutes, the whole house was filled with loud doorbell sounds!

4 When I was preparing to take a shower, my personal small bottle of toiletries disappeared (I must take good care of my personal belongings)

5 When I was preparing to drink, a Wahaha straw was thrown at me on the dining table (please, my Wahaha is still there, why did you throw my straw)

6 The most disgusting thing happened. The clothes on the hangers were changed from two rows to one row, and the clothes, including underwear, were changed to hangers. I was instantly terrified. Did someone enter the room again? Did they do anything to my clothes? Can I sit on the bath towels, bed, and sofa in the room? Did they do anything else!

I complained to the front desk at 10:30 pm and asked the person who entered the room, whether the person who cleaned the room was a man or a woman, and how long they stayed.

At 4 pm the next day, after repeated questioning, I was finally told that the person who cleaned the room was a man, and he admitted that he touched my clothes (the clothes drying rack was on the balcony, who would touch it normally) Disgusting! Throw them all away!

I didn't expect such a thing to happen in a five-star hotel. The most important thing for a person traveling alone is safety. If girls' clothes and underwear can be touched casually, who knows what they did. In the future, I will lock my suitcase when I go out of the hotel and don't need to wash clothes.

Disgusting!

It is normal to wash clothes every day when you are on vacation in Sanya. I want to vomit when I think of my clothes being touched by **. I was so scared that I couldn't sleep last night!

Also, the hotel deliberately did not delete my identity information when I checked out, which delayed me for half an hour when checking in at other hotels. It was disgusting!

Don't stay in this hotel. Do you dare to hang clothes in the suitcase? Aren't you afraid of **?

Later, I asked the front desk about something. They didn‚Äôt raise their heads to talk to me during the whole process, which made me feel uncomfortable. It's extremely uncomfortable. I came here to spend money to stay in a hotel, not to stay overnight. The second is that there is something wrong with the elevator. It was closed before it was fully opened, and it was caught twice. The good thing is that the guest room staff are more polite, and they will greet each other when they see it. This is in contrast to the front desk. The hotel environment is good. Although the facilities are a bit old, the overall is still very good. Third, it is very close to the beach.

Once you enter the room, you will feel refreshed. The hotel is very large, stretching all the way to the beach, very suitable for leisure and vacation. The fly in the oin**ent is that only 3 of the 5 swimming pools are open, and the children are a little disappointed that the children's pool is not open. In addition to the buffet, there are two other specialty restaurants.

msg:The price/performance ratio of the hotel is definitely very high. It is one of the few hotels that does not increase the price during the May 1st period. When I checked in, it was my husband‚Äôs birthday. I also gave a birthday cake and decoration for free. I added Jerry‚Äôs WeChat account when I checked in. If you have any questions, you can contact me at any time. The service is very good. I also upgraded the room with a swimming pool, and the hotel staff are very enthusiastic. There are also many parent-child activities, there is also a children's center, and there are open-air movies in the evening. The children had a great time. There are also private beaches, and there are really not many main people.
    The only downside is that the hotel is indeed a bit old, and the hardware facilities in the room are aging to varying degrees. I hope it can be renovated and upgraded, but the price/performance ratio is too high. I enjoyed a hotel with fewer people during the May Day period, and avoided the crowds. I am very satisfied.

msg:Much, much better than I expected. The decoration is relatively old according to the reviews, and I have been a little worried. In fact, it is very practical. The toilet, shower, and bathtub are all separated, which is convenient and practical. The most commendable thing is that the water output is very large, the shower head really feels like rain, and the bathtub can be filled with water for up to five minutes, which is super awesome! The hotel's swimming pool can also be shared with Ruihua. The scenery is amazing. The beach is the standard one in Haitang Bay, the sand is fine yellow, and the sea water color is goodüëç It is very beautiful to take pictures, but you must pay attention to the sea in Haitang Bay if you cannot swim in it. We mainly go to the water world to play. Eating in Haitang Bay is definitely not a problem now. There is a takeaway counter outside the hotel lobby, unlike three years ago when you had to go to the hotel gate to get it. Thanks to Jerry at the front desk for arranging our rooms together and upgrading the executive twin room. The hotel also has freshly baked small biscuits that are delicious üòã The welcome drink is also homemade lemon tea, which is especially delicious. The hotel service is very nice. The aging of hardware facilities is also inevitable, and software services can improve user experience more. In short, I am very satisfied with staying at Wanda Realm Hotel during the May Day holiday. I hope that the hotel will increase the faucet for flushing the feet to flush the sand.

Jerry at the front desk is very enthusiastic and responsive. There are very few people on the beach. Although you can't go into the water, it's very good. There are several pools and the pool foam party is fun. It is connected to Wanda Ruihua next to it, so you can also go for a stroll. It's also very close to the Mangrove Tree Hotel. You can go to the nearby coconut chicken for dinner, which is very good. The fly in the oin**ent is: it is recommended to remind you of the complimentary service when you check in. Later, we completely forgot the coffee and cocktails at the nearby rui x restaurant.

The hotel lobby and the internal park environment are still very good. The lobby is quite grand, the park is lined with trees, and there are all facilities such as swimming pools. The size of the room is quite large, but the sound insulation effect is a bit poor. You can still hear talking in the corridor next door, but it is still quiet at night, and you can hear the insects in the garden. I don‚Äôt know if the room service arrived late, so there is no special person to serve. The coffee coupons in the room are from 2 pm to 10 pm. It‚Äôs a pity that I didn‚Äôt enjoy it. When checking out, Jerry's little brother asked if there were any valuables in the luggage, and even stored them inside. Overall, this price is not bad.

The hotel facilities are a bit old, and it is understandable that the hotel is trying to make up for it with more package content and services.
The sea view room package with self-service is worth more than 1,000 points, which is quite worth it. By the way, if there are several nearby hotels for self-service at this price, choose him. The service is better. I went to the barbecue area and didn‚Äôt pick up anything. The chef immediately came over and asked if there was nothing I wanted to eat. Can you help me right away? Roast, this attitude is a plus. If you want to eat raw seafood buffet, go to Dayueyang, it is also worth it.
The breakfast is pretty good, better than the No. 9 Hotel where I stayed the next day. If you want to choose a hotel where you can still eat well, Jiahua is a good choice.

You can eat authentic Sichuan hot pot in the store, which is much more convenient than other hotels. It is really hard to find this one in Haitang Bay.
The lack of facilities is a bit old. The advantage is that the price is quite suitable in Haitang Bay. It is relatively convenient to go to the duty-free shop and Houhai, and it is in the middle. It can be considered a cost-effective hotel.

The breakfast variety is not particularly rich. Many things are much worse than hotels of the same level in Yalong Bay. The restaurant has no air conditioning. The breakfast time for the reception group is earlier than the normal breakfast time. As a result, there is no place to go to the restaurant for breakfast. The dining experience is a bit poor .
The decoration of the room is old and the TV cannot be used. The room service is okay, the attitude is very good, and the service is also good, but it is a bit stingy to give 4 bottles of mineral water every day.
The advantage is that it is halfway between CDF Duty Free City and Wuzhizhou Island Road. The price/performance ratio is not bad in Haitang Bay, but it is not recommended if you want to have the best travel experience.

Thank you if you have the opportunity to come and choose! Although the setting of the hotel is a bit old, it is cost-effective. Some guests gave too bad comments. After all, it is the earliest five-star hotel in Haitang Bay, which opened in 2010. I am also a frequent traveler and traveler with women. The service is really good. The takeaway I ordered for my parents was delivered to the room. My breakfast was also delivered. And the beach is only 300 meters away from the mangrove forest in Haitang Bay. Living at the price of Wanda Carnival, you can also feel the environment of mangroves. Next time I come to Haitang Bay, I will still choose Wanda Carnival. Stay overnight in Atlantis. I can stay at Wanda Carnival for 4 nights. I definitely choose cost-effective, with breakfast, dessert in the afternoon, and coffee and cocktails in the evening. The drinks in the room are also gone, and they will be delivered to us with a phone call. The most important thing is to have a big bathtub haha. value for money

msg:It is my choice to go to Sanya after the Spring Festival holiday. There are not many people during this time period, and the weather around 26¬∞C is not too good. This hotel is a two-day package booked by Ctrip. Before coming here, I read the reviews and discussed it, but I feel pretty good when I actually checked in. Although it is a small hotel in Haitang Bay, the environment is not bad, and the service staff are very friendly. The outdoor swimming pool and the breakfast in the hotel restaurant are very good, and the coconut chicken in the hot pot restaurant is also available in the package. Overall, this price is not bad in Haitang Bay.

It‚Äôs just that the swimming pool charges for paddle boards, which lowers the hotel‚Äôs service level. Going to the Xinglong Hilton is free, and the experience is better. I would like to thank Yang Yasan for being responsible, friendly and thoughtful for helping to take care of him.

The parent-child activities organized by the hotel are also great, and the baby and family are very full. Satisfied and happy, the hotel is very close to the beach, within walking distance, the beach belongs to the shared area of surrounding hotels, there are not many people and the waves are relatively big; the hot pot set meal on the first floor of the hotel and the Yanjiang Li family banquet inside the hotel are both good.

When I looked at this room in the morning, it was 1500, and it was already 2100 at noon. The overall feeling of this room is okay, and the breakfast management is chaotic. There are several side doors for access. None of the staff asked me for my room number. But this hotel has a lot of space. The bad review is the service, which is probably due to the old staff, and the overall service is mediocre. The beach outside is ok

But the room hadn't been cleaned yet, so I couldn't get in the room, so I had to take the elderly and children out for dinner! I returned to the hotel at 9 o'clock and said that there was still a room that hadn't been cleaned up, and it was 9:20 after everything was finished and I entered the room! It's the first time I come across such a hotel, so speechless! There is no compensation from the hotel side!
2. When the shower room in the room was turned on, there was a stench, and no one answered the phone to the front desk. There was no way to turn on the shower head for a long time before the smell dissipated! The TV in the other room is broken, and the phone is broken! Cleanliness is fine, dirty is not!

The managers and persons in charge of the hotel should reflect on it.
I arrived at the hotel at 5 pm yesterday and checked in. I waited in line for half an hour and didn't move much. I asked the front line for more than an hour, so I went out to watch the show. I came back at 9 pm and waited for another hour. , to get the room card. The scene was a bit chaotic at one time, 3 counters checked in at the same time, and it took an average of 10 to 15 minutes to process a room card. I don‚Äôt know what the hotel management staff is doing, and the lobby manager didn‚Äôt come out. Many tourists who lined up in the afternoon were very angry at the front desk There was no hotel management staff to coordinate the issue of the room card.
I booked a parent-child room with a big bed and a small bed, and said that I would arrange a family suite, but there was only one bed. Called the front desk to arrange delivery of quilts, bath towels, etc., but the call was answered, but they were not delivered. Called again, no one answered. Then I couldn't get through the phone.
Breakfast management is also chaotic.

Facilities: Very old, the sliding door can't be moved, the sofa is so big that a nest should have collapsed long ago.
Hygiene: The dirty things in the toilet are not wiped clean.

I lived with my child for two days, and basically spent it in a small children's center, and the attitude of the service staff was always like, no, no, no discussion at all. It is not close to the sea, but Haitang Bay is basically like this.
The advantage is that the housing price is relatively cheap and it is possible to upgrade the room. The room facilities are basically adequate, but there is basically no room service. Maybe there are too many people during the Spring Festival and not enough service staff?
I probably won't stay here next time, and I probably won't be staying in Haitang Bay either. It's not interesting except for shopping and the waves are too big.

msg:The concierge in the lobby, the kind uncle wearing glasses, left a deep impression on us. On the first day, he took us to the room, which was quite far away, and briefly introduced to us the places where the children in the hotel had fun; when we finished the handicrafts and went out, we enthusiastically helped us keep the children's handmade products; seeing that I was bringing two children, I also gave them away Our dolls won the hearts of our two children.
I really want to give it five stars, but we can't stand the operation of the female staff in the hot pot restaurant downstairs.
The children were very tired from playing that day. I brought two young children and an old man to eat the coconut chicken hot pot that had been reserved and included in the hotel package.
When we put our swimming bags and other things on the outdoor dining chairs, we were told that set meal diners are not allowed to use the outdoor seats and need to move to the "side room". As soon as I went in, I found that there was nothing inside, and I needed them to bring all kinds of dishes, chopsticks and condiments. I didn't want to be troublesome, so I sat down.
After waiting for 45 minutes, I got up and went to the open-air seat just now to find the waiter, and found that the diners who came later than us had already eaten more than half of the seat we were sitting on. And our guests who were driven to a corner where we couldn‚Äôt see anything didn‚Äôt have a glass of waterü§ëü§ë
Dare I ask, can I give five stars? It's not enough to put all the efforts of the lobby concierge staff in vain.
I yelled, "Do you make hotel packages, do you just eat like this? If you can't make a package, don't sell it. The elderly and children waited for 45 minutes and couldn't eat anything. This kind of service is discriminatory. ?"
In addition, I stayed for four nights, and the price is close to 2,000 per night. Isn't it cheap? If you feel that it is not enough, you can ask for more money. Is it done by people with conscience to keep the children hungry for so long?
Post a photo, to prove that I am a hotel guest, I am not talking nonsense

The price of Wanda Realm is the lowest in several hotels on weekends. The room is 50 square meters big enough. The design of the bathroom and wardrobe is also very reasonable. The only thing is that the furniture in the room is a little simple and old. The bedding is ordinary but clean. In fact, it is just The room facilities are similar to those of the five-star hotel chains in the world next to the daily airport, but in the peak season of Sanya, it can be 20%-60% less than the surrounding hotels, only around 1100, which is a very rare price-performance ratio! In short, I am very satisfied, and renewed for three days. There are also several restaurants in the hotel that have good meals, because some gardens are shared with Ruihua, so the area is quite large, and the price is half of the price next door and less~~Recommended.

msg:Facility: As most reviews say, the hotel facilities are old and really need a refurbishment. In the designated family room, the children's bed is a sofa bed, and the mattress is as hard as a wooden board, making it impossible to sleep on.

Environment: The tone of the entire hotel is dark and depressing. Especially the restaurant for breakfast, the interior is very dark, it is best to sit outside. However, the outdoor floor has been in disrepair for a long time, and nails are often lifted, so pay attention to safety. The location of the hotel is good, very close to the sea, just a few minutes walk. However, the path to the beach still needs to be repaired and perfected. A lot of construction waste is piled up everywhere, which affects the appearance. The deck by the pool was overgrown and left untended.

Hygiene: Hygiene is really bad. There is a layer of dust on the door of the room, it seems that it has not been wiped for several months. I thought it was only our room, but I checked the other floors, and it was also dusty. There is also a thick layer of dust on the floor on the balcony, it should not have been mopped for a long time. Cleaning the next day also had to be urged three times before someone came.

Service: The front desk service is very enthusiastic, praise. There are many varieties of breakfast, but basically everything is outstanding. There are even some frozen foods, such as scallion pancakes. There is also a fee for the swimming ring by the pool. This is really speechless. The hotels I stayed in before were all free, which shows that the hotel is short of money. And as a five-star resort hotel, there is no heated swimming pool in this season, which is one of the reasons why I don't recommend this hotel.

In short, the price of 1600/night does not match the software and hardware of the hotel, which is a disappointing experience.

The hotel's services and facilities are really great, because the front desk also helped to upgrade the sea view room in the off-season, the overall environment is very good, child-friendly, there are many swimming pools to play in (the two days we went there just cooled down, so we didn't go into the water), there is a special In the parent-child activity area, you can also go directly to the beach to listen to the sound of the waves crashing on the shore. Driving 2-3km near the hotel, there is a street for eating. You can eat roast suckling pig, dross vinegar hot pot and barbecue. You can drive to the duty-free shop in 10 minutes.

At present, breakfast is in Ruihua next door, and there are battery cars to pick up and drop off at any time. It's a semi-self-service format, and the plate is beautiful, and it lasts until 12 o'clock. The playability of the hotel itself is average. We stayed at Atlantis the next day, so the hotel swimming pool has never been enjoyed. The Haichang Happy Theater tickets and duty-free shop coupons are all in use. It is the most cost-effective in Haitang Bay. The hotel is quite recommended for friends who visit duty-free shops or go to Atlantis.

The guest service manager clearly stated that third-party reservations cannot enjoy membership benefits, and by the way, it‚Äôs not okay to give me a science guide about Hilton Drip, thank you so much. Check-in is slow, there is a long queue, the facilities are old, the bed is noisy, the air conditioner is also noisy, the tea bags are produced in November 21, and the green tea with a 24-month shelf life, some swimming pools are closed all day, at 8 o'clock in the evening (after eight o'clock, It may also be earlier) only one swimming pool is open, and the air conditioner of the elevator is only open during the day.
I have already agreed with the front desk to check out at two o'clock. At 1:26, the fixed line used by the guest service manager called to ask if I had handed over the room card to the front desk. I replied "check out in ten minutes" and directly "OK Goodbye" and then hang up. I don't quite understand what this is. Does your guest service care whether I check out or not? If you care, did you ask the front desk? Did the front desk tell you what time should I check out? What do you mean by calling me after suing me? Is it routine for guest service to directly call the customer's mobile phone? Is the purpose to urge me to check out? At 1:40, I gave the room card to the front desk who had no customers at that time. At 3:20, I couldn‚Äôt do face recognition at the next hotel, because Jiahua hadn‚Äôt returned it yet. What kind of work efficiency? Is it because I haven't handed over my room card to the front desk at 1:26?
And around 1:30, three or four minutes after the guest service call, the cleaning staff rang the doorbell to clean up...
After thinking about it seriously, there is no advantage at all except that the staff will come up to introduce you after stopping for two seconds outside the Children's Paradise.

msg:First bb two words, living in Wanda Realm may be the most regretful decision of my trip. After listening to my friend's nonsense, I gave up the Marriott brand that I would choose every time, and chose Wanda Realm in order to save hundreds of children. It can be said that it is the work of the budget hotel with the skin of the luxury hotel. Let‚Äôs talk about it from the following aspects. 1. Hardware facilities: The opening was relatively early, and it was connected to the DoubleTree by Hilton. The style of the facilities is very old, and it looks uncomfortable in some places. The front is also yellow and white. 2. Service: That's really not as good as the guest house in the county town üòÇüòÇüòÇ, the first night I took a shower and found that the shower gel was gone, I called the waiter to add it, I waited for 40-50 minutes, it seems that the water on my body was dry, They were all sitting outside watching TV before they were delivered. On the second night, the paper was gone. I called the customer service center and no one answered. Only when I called the hotel office was someone answered and said to add paper for me. I waited until the third day to check out and no one answered. 3. Hygiene: It can only be said that it is equal to the guest house in the county seat. I like to go into the room barefoot, but I stepped on it with a slag. In the past, some hotels had carpets and I didn‚Äôt have these things when I stepped on them like this. This is still the floor. Let's clean up. The curtains of the terrace sofa are all gray, I pulled it, just opened my mouth, that picture ü´£! ! ! Overall, the facilities and services are very poor. (ps: This is the second time I have stayed at a hotel under Wanda. Can you ask Boss Wang to do a good job in Wanda Plaza? Don‚Äôt eat this cake for hotel operation üòÇ)

The environment is also very good! It's quiet to sleep at night! My friend and I booked a sea view room. After staying for one night, I felt that we would not see the sea view. We couldn‚Äôt see it at night, so we didn‚Äôt want to live in a sea view room. I planned to pay extra for a room with a swimming pool, but A very beautiful lady at the front desk directly gave us a free room upgrade (we got a room with a swimming pool as we wished‚úåÔ∏è!) The hotel also has a 5% discount on duty-free shops and a 150 yuan no threshold voucher! The place to eat breakfast is very big and the variety is very rich, there are Chinese breakfast and Western breakfast to choose from, ice cubes are provided where the juice is poured, and most importantly, freshly squeezed juice (and not the kind of cheap juice) machine squeezed out). After talking about breakfast and services, let's talk about the room. I think the room is quite big and clean. There is no noise from the air conditioner. It is very quiet when sleeping at night (I am very satisfied with this!) There is also shampoo and shower gel. , Washing hair with their shampoo is not particularly dry and smells good, and the shower gel is relatively ordinary. Overall, the room gave me a good feeling, a standard five-star hotel room. The last thing I have to say is that the lady at the front desk is really special, kind and patient, but I don't know what her name is, which is a pity (I hope she will have an image of me hahahaha) I will come to Sanya next time I will still choose this hotel!

There are a few bad points. First, the hotel rooms are old and the facilities are aging. Second, the service could not keep up. We booked six rooms and checked in after three o'clock, but one room was not able to check in until about 5:30 in the afternoon due to cleaning reasons, which seriously affected the experience. The third is that the hotel's guidelines for going out to the beach are not obvious, and it took a long time to find a way to go out to the beach, hoping to improve.

msg:We live in a garden-view room and arrange a room type close to the swimming pool. It is in building 3. The first floor is the swimming pool. The swimming pool is great. The third floor we live in has a good view outside. Walking through a tree-lined path is the seaside, and the private beach is not crowded. The room has a bathtub and a cloakroom. There are quite a lot of choices for breakfast in the hotel. I chose a package that includes afternoon tea and a coconut chicken hot pot package. I am generally satisfied.

The housekeeper of the hotel is very caring, called in advance to ask about check-in details and requirements, and prepared children's toiletries and small surprises
The hotel is very big, and it feels like I haven't finished walking around. -1F supermarket has everything.
There is also Universal Food City next to it.
like very much.
Hope to stay in the future.
Also upgraded the lake view room, the balcony view is very wide.

This time, I originally planned to book this Wanda (the price is much cheaper than others) to stay for two days, and then change to another hotel. After arriving, I found that other hotels in the surrounding area were not sure whether it was due to the epidemic. The seaside plank road was severely damaged, and there was no sign of repairing it, so I finally renewed it at Wanda for a few days.

msg:feels good! I&#39;m someone who doesn&#39;t like feedback, but this stay was a great experience! It deserves my evaluation this time! Staying in this hotel is the third hotel I stayed in in Sanya. The first two are more popular hotels, and the third one chose Wanda Realm&#39;s room with direct access to the swimming pool. I have the following feelings throughout the whole process: 1. An old-fashioned five-star hotel, with standardized hotel management, well-trained service staff, kind, warm and thoughtful, flexible and considerate in handling problems, considering that I changed hotels at noon, I arranged to check in 4 hours earlier, which solved the gap time when I changed hotels at noon. Awesome! 2. The room with direct access to the swimming pool is not great if you want to swim! The biggest advantage is that there is no time limit. If you come back late, go for a swim quietly, it is not too comfortable! 3. Compared with Internet celebrity hotels, these old and standardized five-star hotels make people feel more safe, reliable and comfortable! Very recommended!

The children's activity center is only suitable for children under the age of three, and the outdoor slides that are slightly larger are not allowed to play. It gave me a room. I wish I could quickly descend from the upstairs. It is 10 meters away from the swimming pool downstairs. I feel like I have to walk 800 meters. I turn left and right into the big corridor. I am really afraid that it will take more than half an hour to pick up something in the room. I came back from going out at night and there was no parking space near the hall. I asked Porsche to stop my little Toyota after listening to me. I went down to park. I said that it was so dark that a woman would take care of the child. The child was afraid to take care of him. We will send a battery car to pick you up. We will park the car below and wait for no battery car. We walk up in the dark and see the security guard. What about the car you mentioned? tell me to go? didn't you see it? There is no car at all, and lightning strikes when lying. I'm really convinced! There is no anime channel in the room, and I lead my children to watch Central Five every day. There is no TV remote control, no floor towels, no mosquito coils, no mosquito coils, no blockage in the bathtub, and no sockets in the room. Looking at the beach of this five-star hotel, I can only think of a deserted country ridge. I won't go again, I want to open my eyes. Be honest, never fake it.

Before I came, I made a special strategy. Because I planned to go to the duty-free shop and Wuzhizhou Island, I chose Wanda Realm in Haitang Bay, which was very cost-effective. It took about 10 minutes to go to the duty-free shop and Wuzhizhou Island.
‚≠êÔ∏è Sanitation: The overall hygiene of the room is clean and tidy, but there are still some flaws in the corners, but this does not affect the experience of staying.
[Rose] Environment: The hotel is very large, with a high coverage of green plants. It is very close to the beach. Although you can't swim in the sea, you can watch the sunrise with the sea breeze. If you want to swim to Houhai, there are places where you can surf and swim, which is also very lively.
üëßService: The front desk service is also very friendly. I met Spark, the guest relations manager, who was very nice. He knew the surrounding area very well, and the introduction was very detailed. If the suggestion to live in Buildings 2, 3, and 6 requires the concierge to send them back to the room, those with poor sense of direction may get lost.
üí°Facilities: I read online that it opened in 2010 and was refurbished in 2014. Needless to say, it is relatively old, but the price/performance ratio is still acceptable.
[Coffee] Catering: Because I didn‚Äôt have the habit of eating breakfast, I ordered breakfast without breakfast, but there are still pasta for lunch and lunch, Chongqing hot pot and Chinese restaurant options.

üßπCleaning: Look at the pictures, it's too bad. I don't know what to clean.

Let's talk about check-in. It's supposed to be checked in at 3 o'clock, but it was pushed to 5 o'clock. There was no compensation or comfort. It's really drunk!

Let's talk about toiletries. After arriving at the store, there was only one conditioner in the toiletries. I called the room service number for 1 hour and it still couldn't be delivered. That's it? Too bad!

Finally, let's talk about this big bed. I was really happy. Two single beds put together? **It's terrible. It's uncomfortable to sleep. I don't recommend it!

The car was parked in the parking lot in front of the hotel. The hotel management staff placed a stainless steel stopper in the front right of the car, which caused us to drive out of the car and have a flat tire, cut one, and the hotel's appeal, manager And the on-site management kept saying that the hotel is not responsible, don't we drive? It may have been put by someone else, and later it was put by the management staff. I was afraid that others would scratch the car. As a result, I got stuck and had a flat tire. The manager only explained that the hotel is not responsible. Isn't it part of the hotel's reason for parking? There was a problem with the field management, and the attitude of the service staff was so bad, especially a manager Fu, who had a rude attitude and asked us to call the police on 110 and wait for our complaints on 24. God, we people are so humble. From the incident to the final check out, there was no apology, only shirk responsibility. So I don't recommend everyone to stay in this hotel, the service can't keep up.

Although the signboard was changed, I still felt the service taste of Wanda DoubleTree by Hilton. What remains unchanged is the service scene of the year. When I arrived at the lobby, the concierge brother enthusiastically helped me open the door to get my luggage, and went to the front desk to check in. Comrade Xiao Weng, the front desk manager, was very enthusiastic and professional to check in. The skillful means were so professional and memorable. It's a pity that the only hot doubletree chocolate chip cookie (the only symbolic one) is missing, but that's ok üòä, the service taste is still solid. Since I was a former hotel employee, Comrade Xiao Weng, the front desk manager of the hotel, took special care of me. In order to let me relive my memories and experience the new signature hotel equipment and facilities, I upgraded the sea view room. Sure enough, I was not disappointed. The room is very large, the sea view is first-class, the room is clean and tidy, and the warm honeymoon arrangement makes people linger. The breakfast tastes good and has a wide variety. Very close to the beach from the hotel. The pool is also huge. The next day I checked out and saw my former colleagues, like concierge director jeff, front office manager eric xiong, and duty manager ella, etc. Their bright service smiles are still the same, which makes me linger, not to mention other guests . All kinds of memories are vivid. Thank you for letting me relive the memories. Finally, I sincerely wish my old club Wanda Realm Hotel (formerly the Wanda DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel) to be prosperous in 2022, the year of the tiger will be prosperous, and it will achieve better results and better.

The sea view room has a side view of the sea. It needs to be seen. A better sea view requires living on a higher floor, which would be better. The hotel does not have an airport pick-up service. I want a charging head. I asked the guest room to answer directly. The staff at the front desk had a very average service attitude and wanted to store our luggage, but he asked us to store it elsewhere.

msg:Let's talk about the bad points first: 1) There are dense ants or bugs crawling on the bed in the room, which is very scary. I won't show you pictures or videos here to avoid everyone's discomfort, and the children live from the first night to the last. None of the legs were good at night, they were bitten by mosquitoes, and the itchy ones were scratched. Although the guest room was given mosquito coils, it was completely useless;
2) The breakfast buffet table really scare me, not to mention the quality of the breakfast, just talking about the hygiene problem is terrible. The yogurt area is full of mosquitoes. How dare you feed your children with such hygiene conditions?
3) Let‚Äôs talk about the service. I don‚Äôt know how to evaluate the service in the cafeteria, because there is no service. From entering the restaurant, it is really self-service to find a seat by yourself, get coffee and tea by yourself, clean up dirty dishes by yourself, the only service It was after you left that they cleared the table. I finally understood why this buffet restaurant has no customers at night, even though the outsourced hot pot restaurant and Hainan restaurant are doing much better than you, you eat buffet every night but not. How much food is wasted by people. If you don't improve it, I suggest that you can just turn off the dinner buffet. It doesn't make any sense to turn it on.

Let me give you some small advice. You Wanda kicked Hilton out and you have to be better than others. What is the difference between your management level and self-abandonment? Even if the management of the buffet table and your food and beverage depar**ent went to see it. It's not like the bugs are flying all over the sky once, and the bugs in the room have crawled onto the bed. It's terrible. I believe I'm not the first guest to encounter this mosquito problem. We have stayed in so many hotels in Sanya. There has never been a hotel with such a hygienic condition, which is really worrying.

Besides, Lisa at the front desk helped us upgrade our room, thank you very much, and the service housekeeper, who will communicate with us in time if there is any problem, the handling is very professional and efficient.

This hotel will not come again, I advise others to consider this review when they see this review, I really don't recommend coming, the holiday will be completely ruined.

msg:This bad review is for Conrad next door, especially to the deputy manager Amy Lee, but since it's a family, it's not wrong to write it here.
I booked the Hilton poolside room. Ctrip told me that I needed to change to Conrad. Since our main requirement is a large swimming pool, Conrad only has a small public swimming pool, and the private swimming pool is even smaller and pitiful. It does not meet our requirements (not to mention the buffet), so I asked if we can share Hilton's swimming pool and got the answer. Yes, so I didn‚Äôt unsubscribe.
After I arrived, I took a battery car to the Hilton swimming pool and found that the swimming pool was closed, even their own employees didn't even know. I contacted Ctrip and the hotel, and the front desk called the deputy manager Amy Li. This manager Li‚Äôs attitude towards subordinates to us, good fellow, was originally the responsibility of the hotel, not only did not solve the problem or give any compensation. , There is not even an apology. Is this the service attitude of the brand hotel? "Our Conrad swimming pool can be used." Are you embarrassed to open one of the three swimming pools? The employees don‚Äôt know whether the swimming pool is open or not. They conceal the fact that the swimming pool is closed from us. Just one sentence? Ask what we want, do you want us to beg you? The service industry is what you do? In the end, nothing happened. Ctrip is not the responsibility of others, and they contact us again and again to apologize and compensate. This is really outrageous!
In the end, another brother at the front desk called, but there was no solution, apology or compensation. We did not accept it. The brother said that he would delay check-out until two o'clock? Yo, don‚Äôt you say, I really don‚Äôt know if your check-out time is not two o'clock? Express hotels are free to check out late at two o'clock. There are not many people in your hotel. Is it a gift to delay until two o'clock? Finally, we asked if it was a welcome gift again. We answered no, but we didn‚Äôt see any dessert after checking out. We still asked for it, and we still gave a welcome gift after a ‚Äúverification‚Äù. thing. I don‚Äôt have much authority. I understand, this Deputy Manager Amy Li, the hotel‚Äôs fault has caused the damage to the customer‚Äôs interests. The customer is so dissatisfied. Is this attitude? The previous family was in Renaissance, and he casually said that the room was a bit trendy, and they immediately sent small gifts to express their apologies. That's it for you, Hilton's flagship brand? Ha ha.
Manager Amy, don‚Äôt ask customers to ask you to make requests for you next time. For other hotels, don‚Äôt say this is your hotel‚Äôs concealment and mistakes. Coupon room vouchers, these are all basic operations, you want to let the guests see your attitude, understand?
In addition, there is no butler (resulting in a different person in every negotiation, no one is responsible), the room facilities are old and malfunctioning, the waiter is called, the waiting time for consultation is long, and the network is not good, so I won't say much. Don't think that the Chinese make good money, the quality of services is uneven, the facilities are old and not open, and the gold and jade are in failure. Make improvements and improvements!
(Later, the staff of DoubleTree by Hilton paid a return visit and said that adding WeChat did not add it)

msg:This trip to Sanya stayed at Mandarin Oriental/Anantara and the DoubleTree by Hilton. When I came from Mandarin Oriental, I felt the huge gap. If Wenhua is a paradise, Hilton is a noisy vegetable market. The rooms are better than those in the Samsung Business Hotel. The sea-view rooms can only see a little bit of the sea. You have to go through a thicket of trees to go to the beach. The beach is also a public beach. The service is really bad. I bought the set meal and only delivered the red wine after three calls. I didn‚Äôt give two SPA coupons. I saw the big billboard in the room and the restaurant saying that two people massage one hour 598+15% service charge, call In the past, I told me that there was no such price, it was 698+15%. Without this price, what do you do with advertising everywhere? Later, it was temporarily changed back to 598+15%. The SPA voucher was neither given nor used. Do not disturb when it is on every day, and the cleaning aunt knocks on the door every morning! It was my fault that the item fell in the hotel, but the cleaning found that it did not take the initiative to contact us, until we found that the item was missing and contacted them, we only helped me pay the postage and send it back. The whole hotel is a sense of business, which has nothing to do with vacation. When I went to Atlantis, people followed the crowd everywhere. Water World is very small with 368 tickets, without 288 fast-track queuing dead. 368+288 bought the express channel and went in and found that there were more than a dozen projects and 6 additional money. Locker/towel plus money, a bottle of drink 28. The entire Haitang Bay beach has poor scenery and people are everywhere!

Sanya‚Äôs local tourism protection policy is very good, so you can‚Äôt find a supermarket in the whole hotel street and you can only spend in the hotel.

msg:üåøEnvironment:
The hotel is just a few buildings, the floors are not high, not crowded, although the poolside rooms are full during the stay, but the overall feeling is very quiet, the hotel management is also very good, no swimming after 10 o'clock (poolside rooms); hotel greening It is also very good, with tropical plants everywhere, and the large swimming pool also has a lot of green plants to shade.

üõèRoom:
The size is right, with dry and wet partitions, with a bathtub (although not used during the stay), a set of twin beds, two 1.35 meters, I originally wanted to bring a bed with my husband, 2 big and 2 small sleeps should be very good It was spacious, but when I arrived, I found that there was a big sofa in the room that could be used as a bed. The boss was 9 years old and he was sleeping on the sofa bed alone. It was so comfortable. The Erbao family can rest assured!
There are plenty of sockets in the room and the location is very reasonable. Charging the phone at night is not crowded. üòç

üõéService:
Special thanks to the staff OIiVia who provided room service for us this time. They are very friendly and have a really good attitude. The room is cleaned very fast and very clean. I was worried that the first floor would be wet, but it turned out not at all. Yes, this should be directly related to the high occupancy rate and thorough cleaning. On the day of check-out, OIiVia took the initiative to ask us about the schedule of the day and helped coordinate the late check-out. Thank you very much!

üß∏Family:
Swimming pool: The hotel has 4.5 swimming pools, large and small, and the water is very clean. The swimming pool in the poolside room is very private and the water is very clean. Every morning, staff come to salvage floating objects (deciduous leaves, flying insects, etc.), if not If there are any shortcomings, it may be that the water temperature is a bit cool in the place where the sun is not available in the morning (we checked in in early July);
Sandpit: There is a special sand digging area next to the children‚Äôs pool, with trees overhead, sun umbrellas and deck chairs. It is suitable for bringing a little baby to play, and it is also convenient for parents to accompany.
Indoor children‚Äôs music room: The space is not large, with functional zones, bubble pool, book area, and toy area. The content is very rich. The location is in the garden. It is relatively independent and will not noisy other guests. The air conditioning is very cool and cool. The second child stayed and didn't want to leave.

üèñBeach:
Before I came, I read online reviews saying that the beach at Haitang Bay was not good, but after I came, I found it was better than the hotel beach at Sanya Bay I had visited before. The first is clean, there is no shellfish, and you don‚Äôt worry about getting your feet barefoot. Second, the waves are not as big as Sanya Bay and are relatively safe.
The only downside is that there are no shade trees on the coast, it's too sunny! ü•¥

Generally speaking, the reason for this trip to Sanya is that the epidemic cannot go to Southeast Asia, but my husband and I are very satisfied with this stay. Next time, I will continue to choose the DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel in Haitang Bay.

When checking in, because the original room type had not yet been cleaned up, the front desk said it was an upgraded room type, but in fact it was given to the rear room. The innermost room was not mentioned, and it was far away from the lobby. It was inconvenient to get in and out every time. The most important thing is that the balcony cannot be exposed to the sun all day, and the laundry cannot be dried. Trouble at the front desk in the future, there will be less such routines and more sincere. It also serves as a reference for future visitors. When you upgrade your room for free, you must ask clearly what type of room it is and where is the location close to.

msg:The hotel is right in the center of Haitang Bay. The room is clean and tidy. It's close to the beach. It's worth staying in! The children's swimming pool in the hotel closes at 7 o'clock, which is a bit too early. I hope it can be delayed for a while. The deeper pool can be closed until ten o'clock. Overall good.

msg:Die Lage ist etwas ausserhalb. Rund um das Hotel gibt es nur andere Hotels.
In der Hotelanlage gibt es alles was man braucht.
Das Personal ist nett und zuvorkommend. An der Reception spricht das Personal gut englisch.
Das Zimmer war sauber und voll ausgestattet.
Das Pool war auch ok.
Leider waren wegen Unterhalts arbeiten nur 2 √ñffentliche Pools ge√∂ffnet.
Der Indoor Spielplatz war ok. Der Outoor Spielplatz haben wir nicht genutzt da es zu heiss war.
Das Fr√ºhst√ºck war sehr lecker und vielseitig. Der Kaffee schmeckte wirklich gut!

msg:Sehr toller Empfang und Service durch Kim. Zimmer wurde nach Beanstandung problemlos getauscht. Das ganze Serviceteam leistet eine hervorragende Arbeit. Bei Fr√ºhst√ºck gibt es eine sehr gro√üe Auswahl an westlichen und asiatischen Gerichten. Pool und Au√üenanlage sehr gepflegt. Direkter Zugang zum Meer. Einzigster Knackpunkt, die Auswahl der Restaurants in der Hotelanlage sind nicht gro√ü. Weitere Speisem√∂glichkeiten gibt es in unmittelbarer N√§he. Durch eine Flugversp√§tung wurde das Zimmer kostenfrei bis 16 Uhr verl√§ngert. Preis Leistung stimmt hier auf jedenfall.
