msg:Quzhou Nankong Guantang Hotel is the most comfortable place to stay. The hotel environment is simple and elegant. The courtyard, lobby, and rooms are either antique or quiet and elegant. It takes dozens of photos to take pictures of each corner.
The staff are very enthusiastic and the work clothes are all the same. I don’t know whether it is Hanfu, Tang suit, Song or Ming. . . Anyway, it’s that kind. . I feel that it is very comfortable to stay for two days for leisure, take pictures of Hanfu, and then visit the attractions and eat Quzhou cuisine. There is also a Go room in the lobby to play, and the a**osphere is very good.
The underground parking lot is spacious and bright, close to the highway and the main road, and the urban attractions and large supermarkets are also within walking distance.
The breakfast is very good. I especially like the chairs in the restaurant, hahaha, and there are cold dishes, which match the theme very well and taste very good. The dried fish is super delicious. I have eaten several dried fish along the way, and this one is the best. It is slightly spicy, slightly numb, salty, fresh, sweet and fragrant. I really can’t eat enough. The aunt in charge of Chinese pastries said that the dried fish was bought from their own market and processed by themselves. The dried fish outside could not make this taste. The taro dumplings recommended by the aunt really made me fall in love with them. I, who don’t like stuffing or dumplings, ate them with relish. The dough is smooth, elastic, soft and glutinous. Don’t miss it. Another snack in Quzhou, pocket cake, was not served at that time, only the sign was there. The aunt saw that I was interested, and when the cake came, she immediately chased me and fed me and sent it to the table. I have never been treated like this before. New hotels are good! Work enthusiasm is very high! Happy!
New hotels do have a smell, especially the elevator, but the room is okay, no eye or throat discomfort

msg:Avoid pits!!!
If you want to stay in a hotel, I advise you not to consider this one at least in the past six months!
First, the smell. The new store in 2024 is full of smells, especially since it only has three floors, so it is humid and the smell evaporates very slowly. It doesn't matter if young people don't care, but if there are elderly people and children, you should weigh it yourself.
Second, breakfast. This hotel seems to think it is very high-end, but the quality and variety of breakfast are pitiful. How to say it, after walking around, the plates are not full, and many are still cold. Compared with the Lishui Hotel where I stayed a few days ago, it is much worse.
Third, service. I made an appoin**ent for the hotel several days in advance, and the waiter took the initiative to confirm it by phone one day in advance. As a result, there was no room when I arrived that day. I called the manager to upgrade the room to stay. As soon as I entered the room, the smell was very strong, there was not even an air purifier, and there were two charcoal bags in the cabinet.
Fourth, hygiene. Not to mention other things, I actually found a big spider in the room. My wife was scared, and I rushed up to step on it to death before it calmed down. Attached picture later.
Fifth, charging piles. I have an electric car and there are many slow charging piles, but because my battery is low and I have to leave early in the morning, I want to charge with a fast charger. After plugging in, I found that two fast charging piles were not turned on at all, or they were faulty, so I had no choice but to charge with a slow charger.

msg:It is antique and has many similarities with other temples, but also has many unique features. The overall style is Confucianism. There are books about the Analects in the room. I felt very good after staying for two nights! The environment is amazing. It was raining when I came. Sitting in the tea bar in the afternoon, sitting quietly and listening to the rain will make people feel calm and cheerful. The hotel prepared a welcome gift and a warm reception. Lan Lan at the front desk was very enthusiastic. The rainy Nankong Temple has a special artistic conception. The Longyou steamed cake for breakfast in the hotel is a specialty snack in Quzhou. It is delicious. As a member of Delong, the management is still in place, which is very suitable for leisure travel.

We are here for vacation, not for work. Why did you wake us up at 8am? What does your opening event have to do with us? I paid to come here for a relaxing holiday. I finally got a holiday and wanted to sleep in. There were only a few things for breakfast. Why did you open the business without preparing them? The experience was really bad.

The front desk is also very satisfactory and considerate. The odor of the new decoration may need to be replaced with more bamboo charcoal bags and open windows for ventilation. At the same time, the engineering depar**ent also needs to be more careful. The toilet socket of 8111 is installed upside down. In addition, it is recommended to install a folding mirror and a trash can in the toilet. Overall, it is very good and I will choose Nan Kong Guan Tang again.

msg:新開酒店，距離衢州孔氏南宗家廟非常近，包括網紅美食打卡點馬站底也少許步行旅程即可.一進門發現大堂雖然不大，但是整潔明亮,充斥着濃郁的儒家傳統禮儀文化，每位員工遇見都會來一個作揖禮，很好的體現了南孔文化的精髓和酒店管理層對下培訓結果。以前入住過的觀堂酒店都是在市郊或者遠離市區的位置，而這家酒店不緊坐落於市中心，頗有鬧中取靜的感覺。前廳員工都非常熱情，為我提供更便利的選擇，不僅指引帶我前往房間，還提前開好了空調，贈送了水果，去房間的路上經過了茶吧，外面有一個小花園，建築風格非常優美，池塘小魚彎遊，風景如畫，能出片。房間衞生乾淨整潔，還放置了凈化器，給人一夜舒適好眠。
酒店距離高鐵站緊需15分鐘車程就能到達。酒店前台熱心介紹了衢州的幾個著名的景點，也坐落於酒店周邊，比如博物館，水亭門及鹿鳴公園景區等等。離店之際，還收到了前台送的伴手禮，是一個小香薰，我想淡淡的清香可以承載着旅途的回憶。本次入住十分滿意，肯定會推薦給我的朋友來體驗，最後預祝酒店生意興隆，蒸蒸日上！
