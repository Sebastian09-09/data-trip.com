msg:Overall is a good hotel. Is clean, nice rooms, big swimming pool. Downsides are everything at the hotel is very expensive like rent swimming pool stuff, eat, buy coffee. Also is located far way from supermarkets and restaurants so you need take taxi every time when you head out for dinner. We experience everything seems 10-20% more expensive such as taxi, food, renting, beverages in Lingshui then Sanya for example.

msg:A very cost-effective hotel. We stayed two nights from Wanning and were upgraded to a deluxe twin room. I noted in advance that I needed to splice the twin beds and install the bed fence, which was also arranged. I mainly wanted to take my baby to Fenjiezhou Island and Guixinju to feed the tortoises. I thought it didn't matter if there was no beach if I didn't stay in the hotel. I didn't expect that the Southeast Asian style of the tropical rainforest was also beautiful. The hotel's parent-child activities are also very rich, which is very suitable for young babies. May is also the off-season. Before we checked out on the third day, because my father had to work in the room, we went to the children's club to do handicrafts, graffiti hats and beaded bracelets. The baby was very happy. The staff was also very friendly. There was also a sand digging pool at the door. The baby couldn't resist seeing the sand. On the first night, the baby went to the swimming pool to play. Because it was not the weekend, we almost booked the whole place. On the second night, the baby went to the hot spring to soak. Eight pools were opened. The highest was more than 41 degrees, which was more friendly for children. Adults might think the temperature was not high enough. The breakfast was also very rich. The mutton offal soup and fried dumplings were delicious. The children's toiletries were also very attentive. The front desk gave hot walnut cookies when checking in and out. Even my dad who doesn't like cookies said they were delicious. The front desk staff added WeChat and responded to any questions promptly. When I checked out, they also gave my child a little bee backpack, which was very cute. Emm~ Overall, it was a very good stay experience

It is quiet and comfortable. The room is really worth the price. The swimming pool is also very large. There is also a gym and spa. The housekeeper also called in advance to upgrade the room. The clean room has a large balcony. The design and layout are very warm, and the air conditioning is also very powerful. Although the weather outside is quite hot and humid, the room is still very cool. The quality of breakfast is also good, with many choices. I didn't get tired of it after eating it for two days. In addition, the service of Anthony at the front desk was very satisfactory. He solved our extra requirements and treated customers seriously and responsibly. This deserves praise.

Among these hotels, the most recommended one is the Hilton DoubleTree Lingshui, which is very cost-effective in the off-season. Special thanks to the front desk manager Villiam Deng Yingqiang, who was very enthusiastic and took care of some special requests of our group of elderly people. The room was also upgraded to a family suite, making our group stay very comfortable! In particular, the cocoa cookies sent by the hotel front desk are very delicious, and the elderly like them very much

Facilities: The hotel has a swimming pool, which is very comfortable after 4-5 pm. There is also a hot spring

The hotel is also suitable for parents and children. There are many small animals behind the swimming pool that can be fed, and there is a children's playground and swimming pool

The hotel is large and has a parking lot, which is very convenient. It feels like a vacation in Southeast Asia, as if you are in the depths of the rainforest. If you come here specifically for hot springs, I don't recommend coming to this hotel, because there are very few pools, the time is limited, and the pool is also very small. If you come here for relaxation, I highly recommend this hotel, which is very cost-effective.

The brother Xiao Zeng who checked in was very nice. He talked to us very kindly and gave us delicious cookies! It can be felt that Hilton's service level is obviously online!

Hotel facilities: The facilities are also relatively complete. You can feel the rich vegetation of the hotel in the morning, see the squirrels and rabbits in the zoo, and swim in the outdoor large swimming pool. Families with children can go to the children's playground in the hotel in the afternoon, and sports enthusiasts can go to the gym and table tennis room. After a day, you can go to the hot springs in the evening. There are pools with different effects such as milk, red wine, rosemary, and aloe vera. You can also go to the spa. It feels very relaxing and healing.

Hotel service: Xiao Dai is the main contact duty manager after check-in, providing full-time butler-style service, which is very considerate~~~ This time, we encountered an unexpected situation. My family members had water and soil discomfort and vomited directly in the restaurant. The restaurant staff helped to pack breakfast. Jerry, the new arrival in the lobby, was also very nice to help prepare travel supplies and provide travel suggestions. They are all treasure youths~~~ You can brush it twice, hehe

msg:It was my first time to visit Hilton Garden Inn Lingshui. When I checked in, the front desk manager Zhao and the front desk receptionist Xiao Tang upgraded the floor for free. The service attitude was good and each person was given a welcome cookie (p2). The hot spring was comfortable, with many types of hot springs, such as milk, rose, red wine, lavender, etc. The hotel was well-maintained and the environment was beautiful. The breakfast was rich in variety. Thanks again to the front desk manager Zhao and the front desk receptionist Xiao Tang for their enthusiasm~

There are also little squirrels and rabbits inside, which is very suitable for taking children. Special thanks to Damu Tu Tu 02 for helping us upgrade. The room is large and clean.

msg:Very good hotel, exceeded expectations. The price after the Spring Festival is also much lower. The price/performance ratio is very good and the service is great. If you have enough of staying in seaside hotels, this is definitely your first choice. It is very suitable for families with children. First of all, the service Give me the highest star rating. There is a dedicated butler for customers. He will respond to messages as soon as possible if there is a need. He will also care about whether our stay in the hotel is good and is very attentive and considerate. Besides, the location is not bad. The surrounding environment is quiet and relatively primitive. The farmland and distant mountain scenery feel like returning to nature. In addition, the room structure is spacious, each room has a balcony, the hygiene is very clean, and the waiters who clean the room every day are very enthusiastic and responsible. The breakfast is also very rich, with many varieties and delicious taste. I especially like the refreshing tonic here. The one recommended by Xiao Xie at the front desk is also delicious.

msg:I like the garden design style of the hotel very much. It is quite good. Although the hotel may have been opened for a few years, the environment is still good. The whole hotel is like a tropical botanical garden, surrounded by various tropical plants. The elderly and children are very satisfied. There are two super large swimming pools and a children's water park, hot springs and garden swimming pools. They are very good. You can rent paddle boards and transparent boats. Children can't get enough. The breakfast is quite rich. You can also order rice noodles a la carte. I like hot milk and soy milk the most. Snacks include egg tarts, durian cakes, and bean paste cakes. The fruits will also come in different styles. The balcony is large, the room is clean, and the facilities are complete. The service is very good. Help with luggage. Because I have a child, I need to share a bed, and the waiter also looks at it. When the child is small, he directly helps to put it together. From the front desk to the room service, they are very attentive, especially the guy Figo at the front desk. The service is enthusiastic and professional. The guests who checked in were given adjacent rooms, which was a lot more convenient. This hotel is very suitable for bringing babies. friend.

Cons: There are not many staff at the hotel front desk to check in. At that time, there were only three groups of guests at the front desk and they were too busy to handle them. I was left waiting for a long time.

The young handsome guys took the initiative to help carry the luggage. The warm and enthusiastic service was great. The handsome manager at the front desk upgraded the room. It was very nice and attentive. The service is very considerate, the garden landscape has a Southeast Asian style, and there is a children's park with complete water activities. The children really like it. The pigeons are also very fun. The family hotel is well-organized. The environment is very quiet, surrounded by farmland and clear water in the distance. Bay Beach is about 8 kilometers away. We ate at a good food stall in a nearby town. In short, there is nothing wrong with choosing here if it is quiet. If it is lively, choose the beach. The price/performance ratio is very high. The price including breakfast is less than 700.

msg:It was a very satisfying stay. The service was great and the arrangements were reasonable. When we checked in, there was a gentle manager in a blue shirt at the front desk who checked us in and introduced the basic layout of the hotel. Hilton's service is indeed relatively guaranteed, at least for this hotel. The hotel is still very good. Every staff member is very enthusiastic and helps carry luggage to the hotel. Robots are also used to deliver takeaways to the room. The important thing is that the price also includes breakfast of this size. Excellent value for money, highly recommended! ! ! The hotel is elegant and a**ospheric, with an artistic a**osphere. The rooms are large, the facilities are new, and the bedding is comfortable. The breakfast was surprisingly good, completely beyond the expectations of a hotel at this price. The freshly cooked rice noodles and noodles were delicious, and the mutton soup roujiamo was very filling. Because the flight the next day was postponed until 5 pm, I was originally thinking about where to kill time after check-out the next day. After learning about our situation, the front desk staff took the initiative to extend our check-out time to 2 pm. Check out and feel warm. After the Spring Festival, there were a lot fewer tourists staying here. The hotel was extremely quiet, which was just right for us to relax on vacation. The price has also dropped a lot. The weather has been very warm these days. It was very comfortable to swim in the outdoor swimming pool at noon and eat in the evening. You can also take a bath in the hot spring after the meal, which is a great experience.

After all, the weather was still very cold when I arrived. The hotel staff were enthusiastic when I arrived. After I put my luggage away, Xiao Xie at the front desk upgraded the room to a high floor. It was very quiet and comfortable. The room was not small. You could see the swimming pool from the balcony and the beautiful garden scenery. The hotel was very quiet and relaxing. The place to choose for vacation is also very cost-effective.

msg:Location and transportation:
The hotel is not on the beach, but on a mountain, and you can see Yingzhou town from a distance. But it is very close to the village in the mountains. If you want to come here to find farmers to experience picking mangoes and dragon fruits, it is very convenient.

Breakfast:
The breakfast is okay, and there are all the necessary ones, but there are not many fruits. There are tour groups here, so you can't come too early, otherwise you will be squeezed with the tour group.

Service:
The hotel is still very friendly to parents and children, with children's special toiletries, bathrobes, footrests, toilet seats, etc. You can send them by making a phone call or scanning a code.

Room facilities:
The room facilities look a bit old, especially the bathroom facilities, which don't look like a hotel opened in 2020 at all.

Hygiene:
The sanitation is average. The cleaning aunt doesn't wash her hands after wiping the toilet and goes to put towels or something. Anyway, you can't think about the sanitation of the hotel, most of them are like this.

Swimming pool:
The hotel has an open-air swimming pool, a children's water park, and a hot spring. Although it is not big, it is still very fun to take children to play. It's very comfortable to play in the water and soak in a hot spring.

msg:I came to Hainan for vacation during the Spring Festival. I originally thought that there would be fewer people in Lingshui, but it turned out that it was still overcrowded. Driving to the beach at Clear Water Bay was really congested. It took an hour to get in and out. This Hilton is not on the beach. When I arrived, There is no traffic jam, but the location is not very convenient, but the hotel itself is still good. When we arrived at the lobby, there were two staff members to help us with our luggage. What caught our eyes was the festive decoration in the lobby. Check-in was very fast and we also received free gifts. I ordered Hilton special cookies. The room facilities were super clean and tidy. Laundry service was provided. Supplies were replenished in a timely manner. The butler service was very well arranged. He took the initiative to take us to the room. We were also provided with welcome fruits when we checked in. The breakfast was very rich. The sour rice noodles and mutton soup are delicious, and the roujiamo is also a must. I have never had breakfast in other hotels. There are many people at breakfast and the order is a bit chaotic, but the staff will take the initiative Say hello and have a very good attitude. The beachside bar recommended by the front desk staff was great. There were fireworks at night. We went there and it was very lively and we had a great time. There is also a hot spring in the hotel that is open all day long, suitable for a family bath. There are also many activities for children. The indoor heated swimming pool is not big, but for cooling down these days, it is great to have a place to take a dip. During the Spring Festival, in addition to There are relatively few restaurants where you can order takeaways when dining in the hotel. The nearby towns may be on holiday, so eating every day has become a big problem. It may be because there are too many people coming to celebrate the Spring Festival and there are not enough resources. But the hotel itself is very good, except for the price, which is a bit high.

msg:After playing in Sanya for several days, I wanted to go to Lingshui to rest and soak in the hot springs. I suddenly had a stroke the day before check-in and wanted to cancel the order, but the hotel refused to approve it and required a certificate from a tertiary hospital... Forget it, let my husband take the baby to play! The Super Wings room is super cute! The only drawback is that there is a little hygiene dead corner. A big bug appeared when the door was opened. But bugs are not uncommon in the humid mountains, so it is acceptable~
Breakfast is only until 10 o'clock, not 10:30, and the hot spring is only open from 4 pm to 10 pm. It was raining heavily when I arrived the day before, so I didn't play in the hot spring pool. The next day, just after 12:00, we packed up and prepared to check out, but received a call to urge us to check out... I guess we won't come again. Polite praise

If you are tired of seeing the mountains and sea in Hainan, why not try another experience? Everything in a five-star hotel is online. The selling point of this hotel is that there are 15 hot spring pools in the hotel surrounded by mountains and rivers. It's very comfortable to rest after soaking. Although it is not a family hotel, it does have indoor and outdoor swimming pools, children's water village, and children's indoor center (where you can do handicrafts). There are also small rabbits, red-bellied squirrels and birds to watch. Breakfast service was attentive. I especially want to praise Manager Zhao and James at the front desk. When they knew that my child was not feeling well, they were very concerned and asked. Respond positively to our suggestions. It can be said that the quality and price-performance ratio are top-notch!

There are many places to eat around the hotel. There are not many places, but Yingzhou Town, two kilometers away, is still very lively at night. There are barbecue seafood stalls and a snack street with many people. Parking is very inconvenient, so it is recommended to call a car. The hotel's gym is not big, and the treadmills and strength training are relatively simple. Standing opposite the balcony of the room is a small hillside, with mountains and fields in the distance. I walked over to take pictures at night. I was surprised to find that the hotel's architecture is still very photogenic. The clever design here is hidden here. For It is a very good choice for people who have no requirements for the beach. The service at the front desk here is very good. Staff will help deliver luggage when you check in and get off the bus. Every time you encounter problems, they can be properly solved. If you want to extend your stay, you can also help adjust the order as soon as possible. The housekeeper # was added when you just checked in. WeChat, five-star butler-style service throughout the process, attentive, warm and considerate. We were given special cookies and welcome drinks while waiting for the room. The service was perfect and the service was like this. When we returned to the room, we were given a welcome gift. Fruit, and a quiet room arranged according to our requirements, was a surprise beyond our expectations. We tasted the special coconut chicken hot pot in the restaurant. The taste is sweet and suitable for the elderly and children. The chicken ingredients themselves are also very fresh. After dinner, we took a walk in the garden to the hot spring area and experienced the special hot springs and different natural silicate mineral spring pools. Our whole body was relaxed. Hot tea and bath towels were also provided, which was very thoughtful. The indoor swimming pool is open all day long. When the weather is cold, you don't have to worry about having no place to play. However, there are many people around 8 o'clock in the evening and the swimming pool is a bit crowded. All in all, it is a good choice.

msg:Super satisfied with the hotel. This is the most cost-effective hotel I have ever stayed in in Lingshui. It was opened during the epidemic. Everything in the room is very new. The front desk staff of the double bed room we booked was very nice and gave us a free upgrade with a bathtub. The big bed room was so nice to take a bath and watch a movie at night. The bed was very comfortable and I slept well. The interior decoration is very simple but very comfortable. Overall, I am very satisfied with my next visit. This hotel is my first choice in Lingshui. The environment is good, clean and hygienic. , the staff are attentive and enthusiastic, and the room is suitable for families. It is near the small town of Yingzhou, and it is convenient to drive to where to play. It is also convenient to order takeout nearby. The hotel also has robots that deliver to the room. It is a good living experience. The entrance There is a centralized charging pile area where you can charge. There are birds singing and flowers fragrant in the yard, and there are some small animals. There are many red and festive decorations during the Spring Festival. The a**osphere of the New Year is full. The service is also very good. There are staff upon arrival at the hotel. He took the initiative to help us with our luggage and had someone show us to the room. During this period, we added the housekeeper's WeChat account. The service was attentive and attentive. Although it is a DoubleTree brand, the service is indeed five stars. The facilities here are also very complete, including hot springs, swimming, Fitness, children's paradise, one-stop hotel for a few days of relaxation. It takes 15 minutes to drive to the beach. However, there are so many people at the beach this season and there is a lot of traffic jams on the road. There is no way that winter in Hainan is like this, a holiday paradise for people across the country. 😄😄😄

I just wanted to rest early and asked for a quiet room. The staff at the front desk were very nice and made me tired. We were given hot and fragrant cookie pie, and our room was upgraded. The staff in the lobby also helped deliver luggage to the room. Today, we accompanied our baby to check in to the indoor and outdoor swimming pools, hot springs, children's water park, pet feeding, and the hotel also gave us free gifts. I took 5 photos from the trip. The scenery here is beautiful and the environment is lush. I like the quiet and comfortable style here. The simple, fresh and comfortable rooms, and the warm and hospitable service staff greet us cordially every day, like It feels like going home. If you encounter problems during the trip, you will be helped to solve them personally. A rich breakfast, you can switch between Chinese and Western options every day, great!

There are many hot springs, the water temperature is 41-43, and bubbles are very refreshing. In addition, the outdoor swimming pool, indoor swimming pool, children's playground, and various entertainment facilities are all available. If you can accept being far away from the sea and beach, it is a very good resort hotel.

msg:Except for the indoor swimming pool where children can swim without being too cold and the rich breakfast, there is nothing else worth staying in this hotel. Especially the front desk of the hotel has a stiff attitude and is not familiar with many questions. Each person has different answers and doesn't know who to listen to. It does not reflect the unique service-oriented characteristics of the South. Because the rooms are not on the sunny side (the sunny side is the corridor), there is no light in the room. Although it is not next to the seaside, the room is more humid than the seaside, and the sheets are wet. We agreed to delay check-out until two o'clock, and applied for the room card, but suddenly the door could not be opened at 12 o'clock. I ran back to the front desk to ask. The front desk said that there was an error in entering the room card and that I had to apply for a delay again. I have stayed in many five-star hotels, as well as Hiltons elsewhere. The front desk service here is simply unflattering. They handle issues very casually and vary from person to person. There is no unified standard. All in all, it was a bad experience and I won't come again.

The housekeeper # added our WeChat account and provided particularly thoughtful and meticulous service. Our children did not dig sand. They also took the initiative to find a set of tools for us. It was really considerate. The welcome fruit plate was also delivered to the room in advance. Any service must have its due course. This kind of service is really amazing. The environment is also a perfect paradise, with warm sunshine and green plants, coupled with the bright Spring Festival decorations, it is full of joy. The sanitation is very clean and tidy, and the rooms are very warmly decorated. The surrounding Clearwater Bay Beach is a 15-minute drive away, and Monkey Island is a 30-minute drive away. It is suitable for families with cars to travel. There are also many entertainment activities during the Spring Festival. There was a young lady dancing during breakfast, and we met again in the lobby in the afternoon. The children really liked it. There were many people in the restaurant, so you had to wait for a table when you went there. Even in the Chinese restaurant I can't get a reservation. There are really too many people coming for vacation during the Spring Festival. I will avoid this period next time.

msg:I come to Hainan to stay every year. This time I drove here with my children from Haikou. My goal is very clear. I want to find a cost-effective, clean, comfortable and quiet hotel (not close to the sea). After comparing with many hotels, I chose the Lingshui Hilton. The moment I entered the hotel room, I felt that I had made the right choice again.
1️⃣Hotel advantages:
1. The room is spacious, the bedding is clean and comfortable, the linen is new, and the accommodation is very quiet.
2. The concierge, front desk and room staff are enthusiastic and responsive in solving problems.
3. The hotel's outdoor swimming pool has complete water play equipment (paid) for children, so they can have a lot of fun. If you have the right playmates and equipment, it will be more fun than Atlantis.
2️⃣Needs improvement:
1. The Chinese restaurant is slow to solve problems and feels a bit slack.
2. The quality of the buffet breakfast can be improved to another level.
3. Drag pads should be used on the chair legs in the room to block the noise caused by friction with the ground.
3️⃣Friendly reminder
1. It is best to have a car for easy travel to the beach, market, and dining.
💗Finally, five-star praise is given to the hotel. This hotel is worth repurchasing, and I hope you can provide better services to other guests.

The overall environment is very good, and the service staff are also very enthusiastic. The front office staff took the initiative to contact us in advance. , and arranged a suitable room. Xiao Tang added my WeChat account when I checked in. During the period, I always provided butler-style service, thoughtful, considerate, warm and hospitable. The only drawback of this hotel is that it is a little bit biased. When we drove off the highway, it was quite dark compared to the street lights. We arrived at night and it was scary to drive all the way. It was dark and a bit uneasy. When I woke up in the morning, I found that the scenery was really good and there were some delicious food nearby. Distance, either drive or order takeout. There is a large outdoor swimming pool below. There are many toys in the swimming pool that can be rented, which is very suitable for children to play. The hotel staff will also regularly release bubbles for the children to play with. The hotel is equipped with a small hot spring pool, which is suitable for a family. There is also an indoor swimming pool open at night. The water is at a constant temperature, so you don’t have to worry about catching a cold after swimming. The sunrise in the morning was also stunning, so beautiful. The environment is very good, there is a large outdoor swimming pool, and there are water slides in the swimming pool, which is very suitable for children to play. The hotel staff will also regularly release bubbles for the children to play with. Lying on the deck chair is very comfortable, the sunrise in the morning is also amazing, and getting up early for a run is so beautiful. It's a quiet place for a relaxing vacation, far away from the hustle and bustle of the city. The scenery is particularly good. The equipment and facilities are very good. The gym, activity room, and Sichuan cuisine in the Chinese restaurant are delicious. The breakfast for two days is also rich and combines Chinese and Western buffets. In addition, the hotel also provides five free photo-taking services to guests staying in the hotel. The photos taken by the photographer are also very good. Recommended! I will stay in this hotel next time I come to Hainan! The price/performance ratio is too high.

The hotel rooms are nice and the facilities are all new, the balcony has a beautiful view, the swimming pool is large and you can play with various boats, and the children in the children's water park had a lot of fun. The best thing is that the hotel has a moderate amount of people, so there is no need to queue up for anything, there are seats available for breakfast at any time, and the hot springs can be shared by one family. All in all, we spent a very pleasant two days here. Thanks to Xiao Tang at the front desk for his meticulous service. We will come back if we have the opportunity.

msg:⭐The experience of staying at the DoubleTree by Hilton during this New Year's Day holiday can be summarized as: a very unique🌲Forest Hot Spring Hotel, an unexpected🎉surprise experience.

I would also like to thank hotel guest service Dai Shijie👍👍👍 for his warm and thoughtful service during the stay❤️. He carefully provided hotel service information and surrounding travel guide during check-in (see picture 1), which can still be preserved during the popular holiday. The service standard is amazing.

👏👏👏Saving money review:

✅Advantages: The facilities are complete and new, the service attitude is good, suitable for health resort bathing, the hot spring experience is good, and it is a good choice to experience a slow life

❎Disadvantages: The geographical location is relatively remote, there is no sea view, there are few takeaway restaurants in surrounding attractions, there is no self-service laundry, so be careful when visiting tourist attractions.

Let’s briefly evaluate it from the perspectives of 🗺️location, 🛏️stay experience, 🏊🏻♂️additional facilities and services:

⭐First of all, geographical location:
1⃣️ Compared with other hotels in Lingshui County (mainly divided into Qingshui Bay, Ocean Park, Xiangshui [R&F] Bay, and Lingshui City), it is unique. It is located in Yingzhou Town, which is administratively located in Lingshui County. The hotel is located near Longmen Ridge. It is geographically far away from the coast and not very far from Qingshui Bay. However, because it is in the mountains, the sea view is no longer visible. It is a relatively unique forest and mountain view hotel (and therefore the price is more affordable). .

2⃣️You can roughly understand the location of the hotel from Figure 2 and Figure 3. It is between Sanya and Lingshui City, so it is definitely more convenient to choose self-driving for transportation.

3⃣️The scenic spot is not too far from Haitang Bay, Clear Water Bay, and Nanwan Monkey Island, but it requires driving distance. It is a choice that is more suitable for staying in a hotel rather than visiting scenic spots for special forces.

⭐Check-in experience:
1⃣️The overall decoration of the hotel is in the style of the Southeast Asian rainforest, a bit like Wallace. Hahahaha. The hotel is surrounded by mountain scenery, forest scenery and some farmland villages. The surrounding area is very quiet and there is no noise (see Figures 4, 5, 6).

2⃣️The double bed room we booked was unexpectedly upgraded to a suite when we checked in at the front desk. The overall facilities of the hotel are very new. The facilities of the suite are exactly the same as the hotel’s promotional pictures. It has a balcony and is very spacious and comfortable overall (picture) 10,11), the room supplies are quite satisfactory.
ps: I also discovered that the minibars in hotel rooms and even suites are empty hahaha

3⃣️The parking space in the hotel is sufficient and parking is convenient. The only thing is that the hotel layout tends to use flat sites, so the overall facilities need to be directly connected by a walking distance. Even though there is an elevator to go upstairs after parking, you still need to take the elevator before walking up. It's a short walk to the lobby, which may be inconvenient if you have a lot of luggage.

⭐Facility services:
What surprised me the most was the facilities and services.
1⃣️In terms of service, as mentioned before, the hotel's guest service is very good, even during popular holidays. Room service has also introduced conveniences such as robot delivery, which is rare among international chains for following the trend (although you can’t order much takeout here)

2⃣️The variety of breakfast is also quite rich, and Hainan-style refreshments are also provided. (Figure 9)

3⃣️In terms of facilities, first of all, as a hot spring hotel, hot spring facilities are definitely indispensable. The hotel's hot spring is an outdoor hot spring, and a separate area is divided into the hotel area as a hot spring area.
The hot spring opening hours are 16:30-22:30. There are a lot of hot spring pools (about 10?). According to the nameplate, there are also natural hot springs. The hot spring area provides free mineral water, hot tea, and ice cream. Available. The hot springs open late, so even if you stay at night, you still have time to fully experience it.

4⃣️Another special thing is that this DoubleTree by Hilton has an indoor and outdoor double swimming pool that is very rare in Hainan (there is also a separate indoor and outdoor children's playground, and the outdoor is a water park). The two swimming pools are open alternately. The outdoor pool is open from 9 am to 6 pm during the day, and the indoor pool is open from 6 pm to 10 pm. The indoor pool is relatively small, but the advantage is that the water temperature of the indoor constant-temperature pool is more comfortable.

5⃣️In addition, the hotel gym is open 24 hours a day, and you can enter by swiping your room card.

⭐Summary:
👉In general, I still enjoyed great value for money when I stayed during the New Year's Day holiday. Perhaps because the location is relatively remote, the booking price is relatively very affordable; the overall hotel setting is brand-new and gorgeous, the service staff are warm and thoughtful, and all the necessary facilities are available It is fully equipped. It would be better if self-service laundry facilities could be added to facilitate the needs of families with children. It is one of the best choices for hotel leisure in Hainan during the holidays😎😎😎 (If you mainly focus on sightseeing, you should consider it carefully)

I have to praise Keri at the front desk and Manager Li. This is my second time staying at this hotel with my children. The manager not only provided warm hospitality but also gave warm cookies to the children. In fact, going out is not about eating a cookie, but giving people a polite, warm and hospitable feeling will make customers feel warm in their hearts and make them want to come back next time. like!

When I checked in, I received a warm reception from Mr. Li Yuefeng at the front desk. He shared his travel guide around the hotel and thoughtfully presented exquisite Hainan specialty fruits on the winter solstice. Although the weather was not good, the hotel staff made every effort from the front desk, room cleaning, and restaurant. The service to the pool is heart-warming.

A manager named Franklin at the front desk checked us in warmly and friendly and arranged for us. Someone sent us to the room. Our first impression of the hotel was very good. The Chinese restaurant downstairs tastes great, and the dining environment is comfortable. The important thing is that the food is delicious and not expensive, and there is no service charge. The large adult swimming pool is very standard. It is the largest swimming pool we have ever swam in this trip. Although the weather is a bit cold, it is still relatively warm when the sun comes out at noon. The hot springs are all small pools, which are very suitable for taking pictures and checking in. Hot tea is also provided at times, which is really thoughtful.

Full marks for the attentive and thoughtful service. The Chinese restaurant is very cost-effective. The price is high and the taste is delicious. You don’t have to think about eating out at all.

We were a little concerned at first, but later we found that we had not seen a single person from the tour group for four days. The schedule is different from ours. During the day, the hotel is empty and there are few people. It is very pleasant to have fun. All the staff are responsive and very enthusiastic, especially the butler Xiao Tang at the front desk. He is very nice and helps with shopping and delivery. , my mother especially loves to eat the biscuits provided as a gift upon check-in, and Xiao Tang even specially helped us get a few more. The hot spring is on the mountain. The old man had bad legs and feet, so he took a dip. It was great in the morning. There are many local Hainan snacks, which is better than the Haitang Bay Grand Hyatt. There are few people and he can replenish his supplies quickly. The fat lady at the ramen stall is particularly nice. The swimming pool was closed one day because there were few people and it was cold. In short, don’t choose winter when you come to Hainan to play in the water, not after December.

In addition, there are more types of breakfast than other Hiltons. It's very close to the duty-free city, which is more convenient than living in Sanya.
Points deducted: The hot springs can only be opened in the afternoon, and I was short of time so I couldn’t experience it. The indoor swimming pool was not open when I came.
Overall, it's very good. The location is not easy to find. It's more convenient to follow the navigation and drive here. I will still stay here next time I come to Sanya.

The hotel facilities are very new and the rooms are clean and tidy. The most important thing for me is that it can be recharged. The electricity price after 23:00 is only 0.78 yuan/kWh. Compared with the sky-high gas price of more than 9 yuan, it is simply too good. The hotel is also close to Clearwater Bay. It’s not too far away. Although you can’t see the sea from the hotel, it’s still convenient to have a car.

msg:This trip to Sanya specifically chose the Lingshui Hilton Hotel. Before arriving at the hotel, the hotel manager Zhao called to inquire about the arrival time, room requirements, and a free room upgrade. He also gave welcome fruits and immediately felt the warmth of home. When I was about to check out, Manager Zhao took the initiative to ask about my check-in experience and gave me the courtesy of late check-out, which gave me more time to swim in the swimming pool and enjoy my vacation. In addition to swimming in the hotel, you can also soak in the hot springs in the middle of the mountain at night to relieve the fatigue of the day. Especially the environment of the hot springs. Soaking in the tropical rain forest and surrounded by tropical plants makes you feel so comfortable. What’s special is that the hotel drives to Clear Water Bay in about 10 minutes. You can play in the sea during the day and swim in the hotel’s hot springs at night. This is unmatched by other seaside hotels. The hotel's windows face the mountains to the north, giving people a refreshing feeling. Especially on the high floors, the views are amazing. I will definitely bring my family here to stay for a few more days next year.

He was very considerate and meticulous. The Chinese restaurant in the hotel is great. It tastes good and is friendly to the people. The dining environment is great. The waiters in the guest rooms are very helpful every day. The room was cleaned, and manager Franklin also helped arrange a fruit plate before check-in, which was very satisfying. When I checked out, I helped arrange a delay of 2 pm, so the children were not disturbed while taking a nap. It was very user-friendly and really great service.

I didn’t go to the hot spring for various reasons. The children's indoor playground is said to be not big, and the sand pool is open-air. It rained when I went there and I couldn't play. But Hilton is different from InterContinental. There are no points for booking on the platform, and they will not actively ask you for inquiries or discounts when dining offline. This still needs to be improved.

There is a store selling chicken popcorn and chicken pancakes in the children's swimming pool. The chicken that was already soft was still cold. Then the amount given is very very small. The children's pool is a bit dirty. The attitude of the waiters is okay.
Because the air conditioner in our room was broken, even though it was repaired, it was not repaired. Fruit was given. The fruit turns out to be bad. The TV signal doesn't work either. never mind. I thought there were less people and it would be a quieter time to play.

msg:I stayed here for two days. I can’t say it was good or bad. It was a relatively ordinary stay.
The hotel's parent-child programs are quite good, including feeding squirrels, a children's pool park, and a mid-level hot spring in the evening.

The room size is average, a little smaller than the resort hotels on the beach, but it is enough. The charging socket in the room has low voltage. In my room, it was on the bedside table, so I also left a note for the guest room. The balcony of the room does not get sunlight, so it is difficult to dry wet clothes, so if you stay within 2 days, it is recommended not to wash it. The corridor at the door of the room can get sunlight, but cold clothes are not allowed.
The overall interior and exterior environment style of the hotel is rice field style, which is another feeling when walking around.
Service: The next day after guest room cleaning, I saw three bottles of water on the table (the next day, customer service saw two adults and one child checking in)
Meal:. The variety of food for breakfast is quite rich, and I was a little surprised that it was refreshing and refreshing 😉 During our breakfast on the first day, Cindy chatted about our dining experience and food texture while we were eating, and also because of our local food We asked some questions and popularized some local food culture. Thank you very much Cindy😝

For those who booked the hotel after reading the reviews, there is a charging pile in the hotel. After checking in, I found out that it was a charging pile from Weilai. The price was 4 yuan and 2 slow. However, because there was no station fee, the Tesla was standing there for two days in a row. Fortunately, I only charged it when I saw a car driving away in the morning. At the same time, there were very few charging stations around, and the nearest one seemed to be 4.X kilometers away.

Beachside: The hotel is close to Xiaochiling in Clear Water Bay. You can catch the sea and watch the sunrise. The waves and beach scenery are quite good. It is no less than the beach of the resort hotel in Haitang Bay. It is more fun for children (after all, it has the blessing of catching the sea content) It takes 5 kilometers to drive to the hotel, a 15-minute drive.

The bedding was comfortable and I slept well. The front desk staff had a good attitude. After checking in, someone took us to the elevator. The cleaning aunties also took the initiative to greet us when we met in the corridor. We did not encounter the problem of indifferent attitude and poor service that some people said. You can see beautiful mountain views and the hotel swimming pool from the room balcony. The facilities and services throughout the hotel are worthy of the Hilton brand. The disadvantage is that it is a little far from the seaside. If you drive by yourself, there is no problem. It takes about 20 minutes to drive to the Liberty Lighthouse and the nearby sea. The sunset is very beautiful. In addition, hotel room rates increase significantly during the National Day holiday. Of course, all hotels in Hainan have this problem.

The hot spring is very slippery and comfortable. Although the swimming pool is just a large square pool, you can rent boats and swimming rings. There is also a swimming pool for children to play in, with slides and water sprays. When I checked in, I was given cookies baked by the hotel itself, which were delicious. When I checked out, I was given two bottles of water. The service was just right. The sanitary ware in the room are all imported brands. There are not many types of breakfast, but the quality is high, and you can feel that they are very attentive. The disadvantage is that the wait for dinner in the restaurant is quite long, and the meal is slow due to the large number of people, but the taste is good and it is worth the wait.

She probably noticed that I was taking medicine while cleaning, so she took advantage of the break to help boil hot water. When I returned to the room, the water was still warm. Really touched. We went to a Chinese restaurant for dinner, and my family was very satisfied with it. It tasted good, and there were many local dishes with authentic taste. The only regret I have this time is that the hot springs are not open, probably because it is the off-season. All in all, I will come again next time~

msg:The temporary DoubleTree by Hilton is very good👍. The check-in in the lobby is Darcy, the manager on duty, and I would like to give a special compliment. Warm service, thoughtful upgrade of room type, and detailed introduction of surrounding tourist attractions and gourmet guides. The room is on the left side of the lobby, and it won't be noisy. The only downside is that there is some damp smell.
 The breakfast variety is relatively rich, and empty plates are replenished in a timely manner. The swimming pool in the hotel is a bit sun-drenched, but the water is very clean, and the lifeguards are very responsible, so I can rest assured that the children can swim by themselves. Very recommended.

The room attendant left a message after cleaning the room, so warm! Thank you so much for staying one more night. The hotel's supporting facilities are also relatively complete. Although it is summer, I really like their hot springs. Come back to take a dip in the evening, and the exhaustion of the whole body disappears... I will choose it again when I come to Lingshui in the future.

The hotel is currently open for two natural silicic acid mineral hot springs, which can be enjoyed by hotel guests, outdoor hot springs.
Children with children can also enjoy the children's water park and various special children's entertainment projects, so that they can easily take care of their children.
Special thanks to Li Yuefeng from the concierge depar**ent, who was very enthusiastic about helping with luggage check-in. The child in the middle lost the toy and was very patient to help find it, so I must give a big 👍🏻 for this.
If you come to Lingshui and don't stay at the beach, you must recommend Hilton.

msg:This is the most satisfying hotel I stayed in around the island of Hainan. 👍The original plan was to stay for only one day, so I decided to change the itinerary and stay for another day~

I was given cookies when I checked in, and Mr. Dai Shijie sent me a travel guide for the surrounding area, which made me feel the care.

Even if there is no luggage when going in and out, the concierge brother is eager to help open the door.

The room service aunts will greet us when they see us, and they will also greet children friendly~

The little brothers in the children's pool are also dedicated to ensuring safety ~ and get along with the children in a friendly manner.

There are parent-child activities arranged in the Children's Paradise, and the staff members are also very patient with the children~

Even Auntie PA who asked for directions was very enthusiastic to lead the way~

The breakfast meals are very real, and they are all real and delicious, not full of bells and whistles and few that can be eaten.

In addition, the hotel facilities and equipment are very new. It is not as noisy as other popular hotels during the peak tourist season. It is friendly to young children. My children had a great time here.

If you are not obsessed with living by the sea, this is a very good choice. I think a really good hotel service is not procedural and mechanized, but has occasional flaws but has temperature and attitude.

I used to live in Sanya when I came to Hainan. This time I came to Lingshui, it is quieter, more relaxed and more cost-effective than Sanya. Because of this hotel, the rate of favorable impression on Lingshui has soared. I will come again next time!

msg:The hotel is located in a remote farmland. The mountain view room recommends that friends who don’t know it should not try it easily, otherwise they are likely to see too much breasts.
In a five-star hotel, the doorman will slowly come over to you when you get off the car, and look at you as a girl taking out your luggage from the trunk. He may have been sealed by something; I have never encountered such a hotel in Sanya so many times. ;
I asked the front desk if there were only two bottles of drinking water in the bathroom in the room. The front desk asked me with a mocking face: Why don't you drink enough? If you don’t have enough to drink, you can tell me and I’ll add more for you. I’ll really thank you. I want to have a drink in the barren mountains and there is no place to buy it at night. Is it so difficult to understand if there is a bar?
After checking out and asking me how my stay was, I asked if your home is an express hotel? As a result, you just slapped me in the face. If you think you are a**, don’t ask.
After checking out, he called me and asked me if I had any questions. I said that I was in a meeting and it was not convenient to talk now, but then nothing happened.
The only good thing is that the cleanliness of the room and bedding is up to standard but that's what you should do.
The service is worse than 7 days, the price is too high, and with the rural infrastructure in Lingshui, it will be difficult for your family to tolerate it.

msg:Two points that Lingshui Country Garden Hilton Hot Spring Hotel must solve😤
During my stay at Hilton for three days and two nights this time, I have to make complaints about two points, one is food and beverages, and the other is children's activities!
Breakfast: The breakfast was the same for two consecutive days, and the second day was even more excessive. All the meals are taken, the tables are not cleared, there are no spoons, no napkins during the whole meal, and there is only one waiter cleaning up in such a big restaurant! There are empty plates of all kinds of food for an hour of dining, and there is no refill. During the whole meal, I didn't drink a sip of blended juice. I didn't even take a sip of it, and the freshly poured one was gone as soon as a few people picked it up! This is for breakfast, and the chef who made the noodle soup, either spilled the soup when he handed it to the guests, or dunked his fingers into the bowl when serving it. Sitting at the cold dish table, I used up my meal in an hour. Chase away the flies! By the way, I stayed in four hotels in Sanya this time, why is there only flies in your restaurant?
Children's activities: The hotel booked by Ctrip is said to be a parent-child hotel for children, but there is no parent-child a**osphere at all! A schedule of parent-child activities was posted in the hall. The child went there, but no one organized the activities. The child formed a group to play with the children in the playground. After staying for an hour, the child's father felt bored!
It is said that it is a hot spring hotel. I also knew that the hot spring was not open when I booked it. I am a little regretful!
When checking in, Darcy, the receptionist in the lobby, was very polite, with a bright smile and enthusiasm!
When checking out, the male receptionist in the lobby, although I don't know his name, was very polite, and gave us handmade cookies before leaving!
Therefore, the hotel catering depar**ent and children's activity center should also learn from the lobby!

Thinking about sending flowers to my girlfriend when I checked in, I contacted Hilton's hotel manager and asked them to help arrange the pre-ordered bouquet in the room. As a result, Hilton's managers knew about my plan, so they helped to make some beautiful decorations, and also helped to upgrade the 520 suite. It's really great! ! ! There are other details and the service is very thoughtful. I will choose Hilton every time I come to Hainan in the future!

msg:Thank you Manager Ma Rui for your warm reception. Because I wanted to check in early, I contacted the hotel in advance and was warmly received by manager Ma Rui. There were vacant rooms available, so they called us to confirm the early check-in time, and also gave us a fruit plate for a free upgrade of the room type, and prepared a set of children's suits and bed fences for the children. After arriving at the store, I added Manager Ma's WeChat account, and I will answer any questions. On the first day we came to Lingshui, we went to the most beautiful beach and Guixin Farm to check in and didn't know where to go. After asking Manager Ma, he recommended that we go to the Internet celebrity check-in place in R&F Bay. The place to eat sour powder also introduced a place where locals go. The hotel is very friendly to children, and the staff will take the initiative to smile and say hello. The children's water world is better than expected. It doesn't look big, but it's actually quite big, and it's all constant temperature water.
This hotel is a new hotel with new facilities. It is recommended to bring children to drive or rent a car. It is only a 10-minute drive from the most beautiful beach, which is very convenient. On the first day we arrived in Lingshui, we stayed in a hotel by the sea. We really answered that sentence, facing the sea but not facing the sea. The beach is too wet. If you bring children, I highly recommend staying here. It is very suitable for those who like us don't like too many dumplings and bring children to enjoy life. The key is that Lingshui is too small, there is no need to live by the sea, find a comfortable place to live, and then go out to play.
By the way, the only improvement is to turn on the hot springs quickly. When I was walking, I saw a dozen of your hot spring pools. They all looked great. It’s a pity that I haven’t opened them for maintenance these few days. I didn’t feel it. This is the only one. sorry. If I come to Lingshui next year, I will still choose you.
Nothing to say about the breakfast, the quality of Hilton is the same as before. I live in Tianyu now, which is better than Tianyu. There is a special acid powder, clearing and cooling. The little cakes are super delicious. Now Dianping has dinner rolls, and I recommend that those who are too lazy to go to the night market can buy that. We tried it. The egg prawns and pineapple ancient meat inside are our children's favorite. Large quantity and great value.
Finally, I would like to thank Manager Ma and his team for their service, super five-star, I would like to give you a thumbs up!
Recommend the hotel parent-child project to make cookies! There is a charge of 38 yuan, but after experiencing it, I found that it is a must experience with children. The production and experience are great

Xu Feng, the front desk student of the hotel, especially praised us. He received us with luggage service, late check-out service, and finally there was a surprise welcome fruit at the end. I wrote it perfectly
First of all, although the location is not on the main street of Clear Water Bay, it takes less than 10 minutes to drive to the main street. There is a very good coconut chicken to eat at the yacht wharf 4 kilometers away⛵️

There is also a room, which is very large. The price of room 688 is really much better than the famous hotel I stayed in Wanningri 🈷️ Bay the night before. The key price is more than 800.

Comparing it to the Haitang Bay Mangrove, which costs more than 3,000 yuan for the first night, there is no such service 🤔, I will send you a map directly with a fruit, and the waiter is not very friendly. I spent more than 3,000 rai to see if you are unhappy?

In short, from the service to the quality of the room, and for other five-star hotels in Clear Water Bay, their house is really the latest. It opened in 2020, and I will open other relatively new hotels in 2018. I like to live in relatively new hotels, because the hotel If it is old and not refurbished, it will wear out a lot.

The hotel lobby is also super a**ospheric and transparent, which is the transparency of Hainan hotels

In short, this time the East Line round the island is the most, give me a perfect ending

The downside is that the hotel is not facing the sea, and the hot spring pool that comes with it is said by the store to be for facility maintenance. I went up the mountain and found no signs of repairs, but there are photos. It may be that the store is trying to save costs during the off-season.

msg:First of all, I would like to thank Ms. Guo Liwen for being warm and welcoming to us during our four days and three nights stay. Although the temperature in Lingshui has cooled down a bit and it is not as warm as Sanya, the service of DoubleTree by Hilton is still refreshing. From sanitation to breakfast, it is relatively five-star standard. Although the hot spring is a trial operation, the staff are basically responsive to customers, which is still very good. Although children can't play with water in the children's area, children still have fun in the activity area (there are more DIY games). We are quite happy with the Lingshui stop of this free trip. Thank you very much for the hospitality and thoughtfulness of the hotel.

During this period of time, the passenger flow is really large, but it is busy but not chaotic. The breakfast supply is a little bit behind and needs to be strengthened. The dinner hot pot set meal is still very good Excellent service from Lydia Guo Liwen who received her on the first day of check-in. The details are very good. She can consider it from the customer's point of view, and she can readily agree to postpone the departure when the room is full. Praise, praise, although the hotel is not close to the sea, But the bedding is quite dry, the overall experience is good, and I will choose it next time

msg:I stayed in this hotel for 7 days for the New Year's Eve. I noted the room type when I made the reservation. I couldn't close my eyes for a day and a night because of the ferry relationship. Thank you to the lady on duty at the front desk for helping us reserve the room and help us put the two beds together in advance. Let's catch up on sleep right after we drive to the hotel. That is, the thin and tall male staff wearing glasses at the front desk who checked in on the same day had a very bad attitude, and he spoke in a fierce and impatient manner. He was unhappy when he asked anything. Later, I learned that he seemed to be the assistant manager at the front desk, and the attitude of the leader was so fierce that it affected the image of the hotel. How to choose this kind of person. After observing for many days, the attitudes of the staff in other positions are very good 👍 Answer all questions, especially thanks to the cleaning lady Chen Ya Zhu, the sanitation is very clean and I am very satisfied. Although the assistant manager was disgusting and affected my mood on the first day, but the quality of other staff made me feel better later, so I will still choose to come here this summer vacation.

It's a pity that the hot springs are not open this season, otherwise it would be a big selling point. The environment and facilities of the hotel are good, especially the attitude of the service staff is very good. The children wanted to play in the water park, but they didn't open it because the weather was cold and there were few people playing. The hotel lobby manager immediately resolved it and opened it separately for the children. The children went to the front desk at night to look for printing because they wanted to take online classes, and the Trojan at the front desk immediately resolved it, which was touching. Children need to dig sand, and the staff also lent sand digging tools for free. The service is amazing. I hope it will be even better to have a hot spring next time!

The attitude is super nice and patient, and the whole service is served with a smile. I feel very comfortable. I just celebrated my birthday here. On my birthday, the hotel restaurant even sent a big piece of fruit. Unfortunately, I forgot to take a photo. The young lady will ask me every day Is there any problem. I traveled a lot this month and stayed in a lot of hotels, but this is the only hotel I feel super satisfied and want to stay in again. Thank you Ms. Lydia for the beautiful and gentle reception 😉

The hotel manager who received us was Sun Yue. Here we have to give him a thumbs up. Five-star praise. He is very kind. He upgraded our room for free, gave us big freshly baked cookies, and a welcome fruit plate. The child was bitten by a mosquito. Yes, the manager gave us a bottle of toilet water for us to take away. All the services are very comfortable. There is nothing to say about the five-star service standard.
The decoration of the room is very new, there is a drying rack, a lot of laundry, and an iron. The overall feeling of the hotel's design and details is very good.

I didn't have enough fun this time for special reasons. I will go to Lingshui next time and book this hotel again! Five-star praise! !

msg:I went back to Hilton Lingshui again. This time I was pleasantly surprised that there was a tracking service. This time, it was Keith's tracking service. From check-in and arranging rooms, to meal reservations, to late check-out, they all provided assistance. The overall experience is good, but there are some things that can be improved. For example, when you ask the service staff about the quality of the dishes at breakfast, they are indifferent. When you ask about the location of the children's playground, you can't give an answer. It can be seen that the hotel The lack of product knowledge of employees, the smell of children's indoor children's playground decoration is too high, etc. If a hotel is located in a remote location, the quality of the dishes is not "handsome", and the children's playground activities are not interesting enough, etc. This time, we will look at Keith's service. Barely five-star praise, give this hotel another chance to improve, and I hope my evaluation can make the hotel better and better.

On the last night, due to the failure of the air conditioner, Anthony Lee at the front desk was very enthusiastic and responsible, coordinating and helping us carry our suitcases with a luggage cart, and delivered us a fruit basket that night. Although the last episode caused everyone to be in a hurry, it was solved successfully with the help of Anthony. When we checked out, he even caught up with our car and gave us many hotel-made cookies to show his heart. It was a very warm experience. I hope that with the support of such responsible and enthusiastic staff, the hotel will do better and better. I will choose his house next time I come to Lingshui.

The experience of staying this time is not very good. The reason is that I was sleeping in the middle of the night. The phone said that the next room complained that we were noisy. My child and I went to bed after 10 o'clock. Why was it noisy? The hotel called the guest abruptly without verifying it, which affected the rest of the guest and caused the child to cry and make me insomnia. As a star The hotel is so disappointing!

It is explained here that there is a problem with the hotel’s own electrical facilities. Hainan's summer without air conditioning, can you stand it? I could only open the door and let it cool down, but after about 3 minutes, the floor began to collect water droplets, and the quilt was damp for about 30 minutes. I had to close the door and close the window and stay in the room. I asked the front desk several times, but there was no solution, and there was only one person at the front desk. All the guests on the 5th floor ran back and forth several times, repeatedly asking how to solve it, until this night finally let us change to the 4th floor, the 4th floor has electricity, can charge mobile phones, and provide fans for hair dryer. In the end, the hotel did not apologize. The hotel breakfast is also not as good as the average hotel breakfast, which is pitiful. It's the worst hotel service I've ever stayed in.

Teach me how to book a hotel that is cheaper
Unexpectedly, after I went to the hotel, I was pleasantly surprised, and the layout was super good, beyond my imagination! Fruits and cakes are especially delicious! very moved
The service of the hotel staff is very good, very polite, every corner of the hotel is very clean and tidy, the details are in place, the first time I like a hotel so much, I am really satisfied
I highly recommend everyone to try it out!
In addition, the hotel recommends traveling by car. There will be a small shopping mall for ten minutes by car. There are a lot of things to eat. The small shopping mall is quite beautiful! There are fewer people! It is estimated that the surrounding houses are migratory birds!
Will definitely choose this hotel again this year!

The bathroom sewer smells a little bit, but I found it at the front desk and solved it well before I came back for dinner.
Upgraded the room type on the first night and offered freshly baked chocolate chip cookies at check-in. I didn't see any difference in the unupgraded room after I came back from the sea and checked in again, but there were no chocolate biscuits.
The breakfast restaurant has a variety of varieties, the taste is quite satisfactory, and the service attitude is very good.

🍃Environment: Although it is not next to the sea, it has the advantage of being quiet

🔔Service: I would like to commend the manager on duty, keith guo, for his warm and thoughtful service, including fruits and cookies🍪. There was a little problem with the room, and we were directly upgraded to a suite!

In 2020, it should be regarded as a very new hotel, and there are not many people. The service is really good, and the rooms are bright and spacious. Of course, the suite is more fragrant. Hahaha, I will choose his house next time I come to Lingshui.

Although the hotel I chose this time is far away from the duty-free shop, it is also very convenient for the hotel to have a bus to the duty-free shop. The point is that the hotel's price/performance ratio is particularly high. Compared with hotels near Haitang Bay, the environment is better and it is much quieter. Really suitable for vacation, the service is very friendly. Taking pictures is also very good.

msg:The location is in Qingshuiwan but not close to the sea. It is closer to the duty-free shop than other hotels in Qingshuiwan, about less than 20 kilometers away. Self-driving is more convenient.
The hotel has a lot of facilities, but the hot spring is not open, and the outdoor swimming pool also has children's play facilities, but I didn't experience it in cold weather. There is an indoor heated swimming pool, which is very good.
There is no bathtub in the room, the bed is not big, two big and one small are a bit crowded
The breakfast is ok, keeping the Hilton quality, the hotel is not very popular, there is no buffet dinner
The cookies in the store are well received, and the delivery is very fast, but some waiters have a bad attitude
If the hot spring is open, it is ok. If the hot spring is not open, the price/performance ratio is average (780 pairs of breakfast), and parent-child family travel can be considered.

Lucky, the duty manager, offered to help us upgrade our room, and Darcy also gave us warm cookies. Li Sheng took us all the way to the room, and he also introduced us to the surrounding attractions on the way. In the next two days, we went to Dudai Island and Xincun thanks to his introduction. Secondly, the hotel facilities are very complete. The room is centrally air-conditioned, equipped with a small refrigerator, which can put soda and coconuts. The hotel gym is also 24 hours a day, with plenty of water and towels. There is also a heated swimming pool indoors. There is also a sauna room, small and exquisite . The environment of the Chinese restaurant is also very good, the dishes and environment are very good, and the set menu is good for the price. I heard that the hot spring was in trial operation some time ago, and I look forward to the official opening of Lingshui next time~

msg:When checking in, the lady at the front desk, Xie Wenting, gave a detailed introduction to the hotel. The overall feeling of staying for 3 nights is not bad. The hotel is very quiet, the surrounding greenery is rich, the air is good, and there are fewer mosquitoes in this season, so I can sleep more peacefully. The hotel's breakfast is very rich, tastes good, and eats very comfortably.

The bus here is gone at 18:00 in the afternoon. There are a small number of Meituan electric yellow cars in front of the hotel. Friends who like to explore can ride electric cars to Yingzhou Town and Qingshui Bay for food, but the road conditions here are not very good, so pay attention to safety when riding.

The downside is that the hotel's facility management is not very flexible. On the 18th, the weather was actually very good. It rained lightly before 9 in the morning, and the ground was a little wet. After that, it didn't rain, and the sun came out in the afternoon. However, the hotel does not open an outdoor swimming pool, only an indoor one. The staff said that it would be troublesome to open the indoor one and then go to the outdoor one. It's a pity that the weather is very good, but we can't swim.

Overall, it's a good place for a vacation.

When I checked in, it was already past two o'clock, and many people were urging me... Hainan needs to be rejuvenated by young people. The local staff should be well trained not to solve the problem but to prevaricate! I don't know what to do next in the workflow. I have no beginning or end, and I am going around! and! I booked it for the hot spring hotel, and only after paying the money was prompted that there is no hot spring.... Ask the staff if the children play and the swimming pool is heated?

Card-controlled entry, the children's water park is very popular, and the protective measures are also very professional. Third, clean and hygienic.

msg:You have to pay attention to pricing in everything. The hotel's basic facilities are undoubtedly five-star, and you can enjoy it at this price, and some deficiencies are understandable. I have lived in several places in Lingshui, and found that the overall service capacity is really slightly inferior to other places, which may also be the reason for the high cost performance. Need more training.

The first is when you check in. Although it is after 8 pm, it is the peak of the holiday after all, but there is one person at the front desk, watching a lot of people line up, but only one person. This person is too difficult. I have been telling him that he is alone at this moment. Please be patient. The guests have a good mentality, and the most tiring is the waiter himself.

The second is the restaurant. If you order a set meal that you saw on the Internet, you must first come up and say that there is no, then we don’t have to worry about it. We will go back and forth four or five times. There will be a while, and there will be no for a while, and we can make it again. I accepted it and continued to do it, and later said that I could refund the fee. For this reason, adults and children were hungry and dizzy without placing an order for half an hour.

Third, it is expected that there is no hot spring, but it is said that it will be opened. I can’t help but sweat. I found a lot of bugs when I went up the mountain. The hot spring pools are also very dirty. Can this be cleaned?

Others are quite good, the standard of Chinese food is high, the taste is very good, which is in line with the positioning of the hotel. The breakfast buffet has meat and roast chicken, which is quite a variety. The rooms are clean and the hotel itself is very new. The waiter will clean up on time regardless of whether the guest has "Do Not Disturb" or not. The outdoor swimming pool is not used this season, but the water is still kept, which is a good sight. The indoor swimming pool is already enough for fun, and the hotel has also carefully arranged a lot of various activities.

Hope that there is always a price-performance ratio.

It’s boring to stay in the room and watch TV. The hot spring on the mountain hasn’t gotten dirty in the pool. We brought a 10-year-old child, and I said it would be okay for breakfast. The waiter also chased over and asked to pay immediately. It felt very bad. The next day I ran into other elderly people who brought their children to this situation and looked embarrassed. The old man has no cell phone and is not stuck on his body. In fact, it is enough to pay the room rate. The guest can't run away. Take a step back and say, how much can a little kid eat for breakfast? The Hilton service in my impression should not be like this

These are the advantages of your hotel. 2 There is room for improvement in the variety and quality of breakfast, which is a bit far from the real five-star. 3 It is really important to make sure to carefully clean up the flying insects, leaves and other debris on the pool water every morning.

He introduced the hotel’s related facilities in detail and asked about our needs. Soon after entering the guest room, he also received the fruit presented by the hotel. The facilities are complete, there is a large adult swimming pool and a parent-child swimming pool paradise, children can linger for fun. A great hotel experience, next time I come to Hainan and stay here.

The terrace is large and the view is nice. The dissatisfaction is that, first, the bathroom ventilation is not good. Second, there is no shelf for drying clothes on the balcony. Third, there are very few types of noodles for breakfast, only plain noodles and tomato egg noodles, and you have to make your own condiments.

But it just happened to be decorated and it was a bit noisy. Just discussed with the hotel to check out. The service attitude is really good. If it weren't for renovations, I would have stayed for two more days. After all, if you go out, the kids are happy

msg:The location of the hotel is good and the underground parking lot is new. The room is clean and smell-free, and the space is large. Our package includes afternoon tea in the hotel and tickets to Jack Manor, but the manor that I went to according to the navigation is very broken, and I came back without playing. Later, I asked a colleague at the front desk, and the colleague helped complain to the manor, and sent a bag of fruit as compensation that night, which gave the front desk colleague a good comment!

My only dissatisfaction was that at breakfast time the next day, I first saw that the spoon was dirty as soon as I sat down. Maybe 7 o’clock is too early, the chefs are busy preparing ingredients, no one has time to cook noodles for the guests, so I asked the chef if the egg rolls can be made. The chef said that it can be done but it costs 10 Minutes later. Then I decided to give up the egg roll. After a while, the chef walked to my table and said in a loud voice, "It's been half an hour, don't you want your omelet?" The people nearby heard it, and I was so embarrassed that I had to say oh okay, sorry, the chef then walked to the omelet stall and said I'll heat it up for you. I walked back after a while and went to fry. The direction of the egg stall pointed out and said, when it is done, you can get it. Uh, this, okay, I admit it, breakfast buffet, sigh...

msg:The breakfast is good, the environment is good, travel is also convenient, the service is very good, and they can respond in time. But the hardware facilities of the room are really disappointing. I booked for two days. On the first day, there was a problem with the air conditioning in the room. After a few hours of opening, the temperature couldn't drop. Think about Hainan in July, the room temperature is 27-8 degrees, and it's 12 o'clock in the evening 🤦‍♀️ After reacting with the front desk of the hotel the next day, I opened the room and checked it and said it was normal ⊙ω⊙
  But then the front desk called again and told us to change our room. Isn't it okay? Why do you want to change it again? But the room was obviously cooler after the change. However, at night the problem came again. There is no hot water. The staff came twice but couldn't solve it. In the end, it can only be left to nothing. Do not take a bath and sleep on a hot day. This is Lingshui Hilton. The Wenchang and Xinglong Hiltons I lived in before were very good, both in terms of hardware and services. Lingshui may really happen to hit our house.

不過自我安慰了一番 畢竟希爾頓嘛 房間好一點就行
🧹衞生：進房間後剛開始感覺還可以 有浴缸 也有陽台 房間也很大 過了兩個小時後才發現 其中一瓶水的瓶蓋是打開過的 細思極恐 剛剛喝過的一瓶水有沒有問題 陽台和衞生間也有明顯的污漬 這些都是小問題 第二天早上發現小孩有點高燒並且背上和手臂都起了紅斑 也不是熱出來的一點一點的那種紅疹  床上用品的乾淨程度顯而易見 立馬決定第二天換酒店

🍃環境：酒店的室外温泉都不能用 衹有室內一個小的游泳池 
🔔服務：這個也很關鍵 因為小孩發燒並且起了紅斑 加上對衞生的不滿意 決定退掉後面兩晚的房間 酒店開始死活不同意 到前台去溝通 前台有個長得馬臉的女孩 直接説這裡是辦理入住的地方 你有問題去找平台溝通 我們這裏處理不了 what ？那時候就衹有一個客人在辦理入住 又不忙 為什麼處理不了我的問題 連問都不問就這樣回答 這種服務還不如普通的快捷酒店 難道希爾頓就因為加了逸林兩個字就整體檔次就下降了這麼多嗎  後來在我第三次來了後才請出了一位酒店管理層 溝通一番後説要去申請 好不容易終於結束了這段酒店之旅 最後忠告一下酒店

msg:I travel around the island in Hainan once a year, and I have stayed in many hotels and compared many hotels. The price/performance ratio of this Hilton in Lingshui is surprisingly good. The hotel is very new, opened for more than half a year, from the facilities to the staffing are very new. From the intercontinental of Haitang Bay, I was worried at the beginning. After all, the price is there, I am afraid that there will be a difference in my heart. Fortunately, the hotel manager and front desk clerk nicole are very good, and the details that are not in place are made up for in the subsequent services. This DoubleTree by Hilton has no sea view, surrounded by mountains, few people and quiet, and the environment is also very good.

msg:The child booked this hotel in advance for his birthday, and he started calling the front desk to ask if he could simply decorate the room. The hotel said there were no balloons, but it would help to stack a few small animals. Ask if there is a bathtub in my room and say me The reserved room does not have a bathtub. So I didn't care too much about these two questions, and arrived at the hotel. The front desk told me to upgrade the room for me. As soon as I entered the room, I saw the words Happy Birthday on the bed, not to mention any surprises. Then I looked at the bathroom, wow, the bathtub appeared in front of my eyes, the children’s favorite, it was much better than I thought. , Exceeded expectations! A special surprise. Before I checked in, I saw two children with me. Xiao Zou at the front desk quickly took out 2 small gifts (bath suits) for the children. Each of us got a chocolate chip cookie from the hotel. In the evening, enjoy the set meal brought when you booked the hotel in the western restaurant on the first floor of the hotel. The catering manager Sun Hai asked warmly to introduce us to the hotel’s facilities, the taste of the food is not appropriate or anything, the service is too attentive, the hotel’s ground floor free parking lot The swimming pool and children's playground are all very good. I think this hotel is the king of cost performance, compared to Sanya. Thank you all my colleagues in the hotel for making the children happy and having a happy birthday! Thanks, refill!

msg:There is no sense of service, the service is extremely poor, and the training of personnel is not in place. I stayed in a room with a broken air conditioner. It took half an hour for the front desk to send someone to repair it. The repair itself took half an hour. I proposed to change the room. The front desk sent someone to me and I waited until the air conditioner was repaired and no one came! I called the front desk again and didn't answer it at all. Can you imagine waiting for an hour in an air-conditioned room in Hainan! ? No sense of service at all. At dinner, I ate two buffets and no one took the dishes. The staff chatted beside me as if I didn’t see them. Another table complained. The manager came and refunded the full amount. Am I too good to talk? ! The service improved the next morning and the dishes were collected very diligently. In summary, this hotel has new facilities, but the staff training is extremely poor, and it is not worthy of the five-star and Hilton brands. Although there was someone picking up and pushing luggage when I checked in, I mistakenly thought that I would be so thinking about the whole process, but I didn't expect it to be so unpleasant when I arrived in the room. Will complain to Hilton Group. This hotel will not stay in this hotel for the second time, and these facilities are in vain! Finally, breakfast is ok, lunch is delicious for dinner, western barbecue stalls are terribly unpalatable, shrimp and crab have the same texture as mud, grilled squid is particularly fishy, imagine it! There is a small children's water park. The facilities are OK, the service is -100 points!

The small tent in the parent-child room is very cute, the toilet space is quite large, and there are too many people to stand up. There is some distance from the resort, about 10-15min by car. The parking is convenient, the staff is kind and enthusiastic, and there are staff at the entrance and exit of the car to help with luggage. After checking out, there was a very shy young man in a light blue uniform in the lobby asking if he needed help, and he waited for us for a long time until the car came to help us put the luggage in the trunk.

msg:Considering the new hotel, 20 minutes drive from duty-free, the price is moderate. After checking in, I had a nigh**are. There was no hot water to take a bath, which caused my friend to wash cold water during his menstrual period, and the toilet could not be flushed. It was reported that the front desk did not even have a polite apology, and shied the responsibility everywhere. Know, check out hot water is not resolved. The breakfast was changed from a buffet due to the small number of occupants. The bacon was cold, and 3 drinks were included. Does this make people feel full? The menu design is unreasonable. In order to save energy costs, the swimming pools and children's play pools are all closed and the water is drained. This is the first time I have experienced a five-star hotel with this style. If you can't afford to open a hotel, you can change it to a hotel or hostel, which will damage Hilton's image. Corporate culture and personnel training are useless. Is it the rhythm before closing down?

我們的管家李月風給升級了房型，是帶浴缸的小朋友很喜歡，管家也很認真負責，遇到問題會及時解決。
酒店的水樂園，游泳池，温泉都很不錯，小童樂園衹適合學齡前的小童玩玩
早餐也挺不錯的，菜品很豐富！

酒店自帶的温泉感覺不是很合理，要爬很多樓梯，累！
酒店有蔚來和理想的新能源充電樁，很方便，要是有小電車能幫忙接送到電車停車位就好了畢竟還是要走一段路的
前台小唐服務很周到，有求必應
整體來説，還是非常不錯！

msg:此次海口-陵水一行真是愉快又舒心。因為帶着小朋友，在陵水有很多的酒店可供選擇，查看了很多攻略，參差不齊。最後選擇了希爾頓逸林温泉酒店，一方面是因為在別的城市常住希爾頓，感覺還不錯，另一方面看中服務品質，結果獲得了意外的驚喜。

 服務：前台接待的Keri女士非常熱情且專業，因攜帶小朋友的關係為我們免費升級了房間。告知我們有任何問題可以隨時和她溝通，工作效率非常高。之後因開具發票原因幫助我反覆溝通，不辭辛苦，在此表示感謝！

衞生：房間安靜且舒適，清潔度非常好。我本人有些輕微潔癖，所以每次入住酒店都會用酒精濕巾等對房間內可接觸部分進行擦拭，發現擦過的紙巾都挺乾淨的。房間內沒有黴氣異味，沒有蚊蟲，這在海南挺不容易的。

小童服務：酒店悉心為小朋友準備了可愛的洗護套裝產品和小童浴衣拖鞋，安排了親子活動項目，小童水上樂園有泡泡大作戰，小朋友玩得很盡興。翌日，Keri女士為小朋友送來了水果盤，各種新鮮的水果真是非常貼心了。

餐飲：酒店的早餐中西結合，我們比較偏愛西式早餐，在這裏可以看到做得還不錯的各類西式餐飲。服務也還不錯。

建議：唯獨有一點建議改進，充電樁車位距離大廳位置稍遠，有些許不便利。

綜上，陵水希爾頓逸林温泉酒店真的是不錯的選擇，還會再來。再此感謝keri女士的熱情招待。

房間乾淨整潔，早餐選擇性也多，酒店的海南粉好好吃，比其他酒店的小料多，調配出來真不錯👍

但是酒店環境非常棒，綠化率很高，還有温泉，是真正的度假酒店。

於是去萬寧也果斷選擇了希爾頓，也很不錯。

       酒店大堂寬敞明亮的空間，裝飾温馨，酒店員工的熱情接待更是讓家人感到賓至如歸。辦理入住手續後，發現房間空間大，設施齊全，且裝飾精美，給人一種寧靜和温馨的感覺。酒店的温泉池子多而且衞生乾淨，四周環繞着綠樹和花草，對環境要求高的老媽都非常滿意。除了温泉，酒店的早餐豐盛，小童、健身、游泳設施也非常完備，晚上在中餐廳吃過一次，稱得上驚喜，餐飲質量相當不錯，價格也親民。
     大人小孩每天遊玩回來，泡泡温泉，消困解乏，這次陵水之旅家人收穫許多美好的瞬間， 希爾頓逸林温泉酒店也是為旅途增香添色，建議大家可以多住幾天，來這裏感受一下温泉帶來的美好和愜意。最後特別感謝Amber.Z經理，讓家人的海南之行留下美好回憶。
南灣猴島可以玩一天，早出發避免纜車排隊，8點半前酒店出發，到達景區遊覽路線:乘坐纜車（往）→猴島公園（遊）→乘坐觀光→呆呆島（遊）→乘坐觀光車（返）→乘坐輪渡（返）線路
如果節假日出發又晚，容易遇高峯，遊覽路線:乘坐輪渡（往）一乘坐觀光車（往）→呆呆島（遊）→乘坐觀光車（往）→猴島公園（遊）→乘坐纜車（返）
提前一天網上購票，我們買的套票（猴島公園票+呆呆島票+來回纜車/輪渡/觀光車票+魚排參觀+疍家港灣遊+魚食投喂），孩子玩的很開心。
南灣猴島遊注意兩點：1、猴島上不要讓孩子背包、拿水、拿塑料袋，讓最高大的男士來背包。2、不要去疍家魚排（海上的那種）吃飯，個人感覺貴的很離譜。

位置：下高速2分鐘車程到酒店，到陵水南灣猴島僅僅25分鐘車程，順便買了一些水果喂猴子，挺好玩的。英州農貿市場夜市一條街全是美食，到三亞國際免税城還有免費穿梭巴士，總之很方便啦！
設施：最近海南20度，這個氣温在酒店泡温泉特舒服，酒店還有旅拍耶，還有室內泳池太棒了！
服務：剛到酒店有人幫忙拿行李指引，入住時還有熱呼呼的曲奇，Keri小姐姐很貼心，幫我們把兩間房安排臨近房間，耐心給我們介紹周邊好玩好吃的。很喜歡早餐的陵水酸粉，旅遊旺季了早餐人挺多的，有點過節氣氛了哈，哈哈哈
此次旅行在這兩天很開心，旅行結束後又開始忙碌起來，以後假期還會選希爾頓，再次謝謝Keri[愉快]

酒店的温泉非常好，雖然趕上海南降温了，但是温泉很好的帶來了温暖和舒適。人多但是水池也挺多的，足夠用。
大堂裏的小bar點餐很方便，紀念品還可以郵寄，但是小姐姐如果能更積極一點就更好了👌

msg:期望～失望～期望～滿意，這可真是一次刷新三觀之旅。
先説槽點：酒店的旅行社銷售，不知道是如何被錄用的？！讓我來教你什麼叫專業，什麼叫服務！First Blood: 聯繫你可真難，不到給總機發火，不投訴到希爾頓總部你是聯繫不到的，更別説主動聯繫客户。 Double kill: 我是散客團隊組織者怎麼了？錢不是我出得，酒店不是我推薦的？你家生意好是吧？這麼牛！全程沒有稱呼，趾高氣昂的説話，何談服務？ Triple kill: 客户提出問題調一間雙床，你有困難調不了，麻煩你出個解決方案，我教你：今天因為有大型團隊在，不確定他們是否續住或者幾點退房，您看明天我儘早看一下，跟進調房，如果實在調不開我給您安排加床可好？也不影響您入住。（你格局大一點，免費給客户加。你沒格局也沒關係，加上一句但是會收取您一點費用，您看介意嗎？）這是一個專業的方案回覆給客户。客户要結果！ Quadra kill: 你倒好，直接讓我回復客户，第二天再調，請問第二天你忘了怎麼辦？客户到了你調不出又該如何應對？客户在前台發飆，提前一天給酒店説硬是拖到第二天還沒有解決方案，前廳部給你擦屁股？前廳部處理投訴無非升級送水果，浪費酒店資源。Penta Kill：最**的，也是最雷人的一句話：你説客户訂什麼房型，你安排什麼房型，有什麼毛病？是沒毛病，如果是這樣我還要酒店員工服務個毛線，直接全酒店換機器人處理算了。業主還花錢養你們幹嘛！
中間槽點：向總部投訴了，酒店值班經理聯繫，提個建議，如果聯繫我請帶着解決方案來，光道歉，沒意義，因為犯錯的不是你，替他人道歉，沒解決問題=0
忠告：本次項目海南區所有希爾頓都作為目標酒店給客户，希爾頓已經敗退海南，一家家關不是沒有原因，明年也不會把希爾頓列入任何項目給客户入住。
唯一滿意：餐廳接待還行，比較人性化，遠程下單，客户也順利用餐。FOM Amber 幫忙協調點贊，我們也沒有什麼過分要求，不要任何你們有成本的東西，結果這麼糟糕。這五分出於，後來訂單，我沒提示，Amber也識別接待好了，表示感謝！ Excom 該重視了，不是所有人都理解你們，還給分。

一泊だけの滞在でしたが、部屋やホテルの施設が清潔に保たれていて、また、スタッフの皆さんもとてもフレンドリーだったので、良い滞在になりました。ホテルの温泉も、様々な温度が選べる点が良かったです。また是非宿泊します！

酒店的糟粕醋火鍋也好吃，環境好，比外面的飯店好吃乾淨。
退房的時候Keri也很貼心，詢問入住體驗等，非常好。

服務：不知為何，第一次早餐時服務特別細緻，幫忙沖咖啡，拿酸奶，並多次詢問是否有別的需要，但晚餐在中餐廳的服務就冷淡了許多。

msg:這是我陵水定的非常失敗的酒店
本來想着之前去過海邊了，那就住一個不靠海邊，在暑假相對來説價格稍微便宜一點的酒店吧
其實價格低也要1500+一晚，而且到了暑期這家溢價特別明顯，溢價也就算了，能理解，
但是這家的地理位置和酒店設施，真的沒讓我覺得這是一家五星酒店或者1000+酒店的標準
地理位置特別偏，周邊路都沒有路燈，到哪衹能打車或者自駕，當然這家跟旅遊團合作，所以也是能堅持下去的原因，
説是温泉酒店，在三亞需要温泉麼？真是噱頭
還有1500+的家庭房衹放了兩套牙刷和牙杯
房間還漏水，洗完澡地上都是水，第一天點的房間用餐，放了兩天都沒人收拾
大夏天，酒店室內泳池不開。

房間很乾凈，面積也大。早餐人不多，沒有那樣的亂糟糟的環境，體驗很好。酒店小童活動也跟多，不用擔心小朋友沒地方玩。
下次和朋友在來體驗一次，這次的旅途很短暫。

msg:這是近期住過最滿意的酒店，處處細節都體現服務的用心之處，唯一覺得可惜的就是住的時間太短了，1、這裏入住前就會主動聯繫我們，建立良好的住前體驗，對酒店第一印象很好。
2、這家希爾頓主打温泉和親子主題，温泉是下午開到晚上，適合飯後消遣和放鬆。另外酒店裡麪養了很多小動物，寵物餵養的活動小朋友真的太喜歡了，白色的小老鼠特別可愛。
3、成人娛樂也很豐富，乒乓球室、棋牌室、KTV等，有個桌球就更好啦。
4、人性化的服務理念，入住時大堂有提供兩種歡迎飲品，免費的曲奇小餅乾都是有温度的，安排的房間是精心挑選的，Franklin經理親自帶我們回房間介紹酒店及周邊出行，非常專業細心且彬彬有禮。

msg:住了5天4晚 整體的感覺 還算是不錯
優點：酒店服務 衞生情況  
🌟前台小哥Evan 很不錯 在訂房前打電話恰好是Evan接的 很耐心的幫助我訂購了價格最優惠的套餐 並且提供了升級房型 訂房前你們也可以找她試試 體驗會更好 
🌟餐吧小哥 買的已經削好的菠蘿 本想讓餐吧小哥切一下就行 這個小哥 真的超認真 
洗手-洗菠蘿-挑菠蘿上的黑點點-切塊-洗盤子-裝盤 
缺點：成人的娛樂設施相對較少 
淡季衹有游泳 温泉不開 
早餐一般 種類不多 也沒有太出彩的 
整體來説 很不錯的入住體驗

小唐超級貼心～送的小餅乾也好吃😋
酒店的温泉免費，還有泳池也很乾凈！小童泡池還有泡泡雨，看得我都想下去玩了。
本來想去萬寧住，但這裏覺得還不錯經濟實惠，直接續住兩天！

msg:比較一般，談不上好壞，位置不靠海，在高速公路下來，周邊很偏僻，房間也衹能説一般般。既沒有海邊酒店的風景也沒有豪華的內飾，早飯質量也很普通。

msg:酒店位置不錯，內部設施齊全，可以打乒乓球，游泳，泡温泉，甚至有影院。環境很棒，我的房間被免費升級過房型，陽台是山景的，可以看到泳池，早晨遠處山間依稀薄霧。跟其他希爾頓一樣如果入住時餓了可以提供免費的現烤堅果曲奇，很大個也很好吃。正好趕上暴雨，酒店禮賓部小哥還很細心提醒路況，確認積水是否影響車輛通行。總之一次很棒的住店體驗。

msg:前台小唐服務很貼心，服務可以得五分，酒店景觀很好但房間黴味也確實存在，雖然竭盡所能的幫忙調換房間但還是不可避免，晚上的時候空調感覺温度下不來，聯繫維修部的小哥哥也一直盡力盡力的努力解決問題，但酒店設施原因吧，效果不太行，之後送來了風扇好了一些。爸媽睡的房間大概空氣也不是特別好，一直做夢。早餐還算豐富，但由於沒睡好胃口一般吃的很少，爸媽覺得還行
