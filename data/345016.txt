The room itself was too hot and the airconditioning did not seem to help. Sheets were a little dusty as well. For quick,  convenient trips it is a good option.

I was pleasantly surprised to receive a free room upgrade and the room itself was lovely. The only minor issue I experienced was that the room was a bit too warm, but overall it was a great stay and I would highly recommend the Westin Hotel to anyone looking for a lovely  and comfortable stay.

msg:Overall a disappointing experience for several reasons. I‚Äôm not one who usually writes negative reviews or makes lists of issues when I stay at hotels, but there were a few that were difficult to ignore: 

1. I stayed on Christmas Eve because we were having the hotel‚Äôs brunch the next day. I thought I would have a nice, relaxing morning to wake up and get ready, but instead was awoken to construction work out in the hallway‚Äîdrilling and hammering that were incredibly loud. Furthermore, the whole room was then filled with the STRONGEST, AWFUL smell of burning plastic that I had ever smelt. Because none of the windows in the room could open, I had to suffer through the smell and try to ready as quickly as possible‚Ä¶not a pleasant way to wake up! 

2. The bathroom just wasn‚Äôt clean. There were urine and possible blood stains on the toilet seat and floor that I had to wipe away when I first arrived to the room. Cleaning services should do a better job to check the toilet surfaces when cleaning. 

3. It‚Äôs December and the middle of a cold snap in Shanghai, but for some reason the room was unbearably hot and stuffy. I turned off the heating and even tried to turn on the cold AC but the temperature remained the same. It was difficult to sleep because of how hot and sweaty I was. The windows couldn‚Äôt be opened so I couldn‚Äôt even get a fresh breeze‚Ä¶

The room was clean, spacious and comfortable and I loved the bath tub with a view. My only complaint would be no black out blinds so it was quite light in the morning and I woke earlier than I would like to have given it was a Sunday.  Breakfast was good but extremely busy when we went down at 9am and so we queued for approximately 30 minutes before being seated. Overall a very pleasant stay.

msg:This hotel has become one of my staycation delights.  The price point with the benefits is amazing. My room was amazing... though the view was only okay (but there are better rooms with a view available)... It was spacious with an extremely comfortable bed.
The bathtub was huge, and I, as a large person could soak comfortably....but I think the drain in my tub had problems. I'm sure I could have informed housekeeping to fix it, but I didn't want to bother. Though next time I will if it happens again.
The room service menu was good..  my room didn't originally have the qr code for ordering. I had to talk to the concierge several times and housekeeping... Each time they seemingly didn't believe me when I said my room didn't have a qr code.... It wasn't until I invited the staff into my room they realized I didn't have a qr code to scan. Once it was found out I didn't have a code in my room, they brought me one . I appreciate bringing technology in to rooms... But with no hard copy menu and only relying on an app..it took 12+ hrs to finally be able to order..

So, all in all.... Amazing. I would stay again instantly. But my room service debacle would leave me hesitant. The food was good, but the difficulty using their app/qr code when nobody believed me about it not being in my room until I brought them in to show them.... It left a sour taste in my mouth..... 

So stay at the Hotel... just be prepared that room service may not be as easy as picking up the phone (I tried but couldn't place an order without scanning the non existent qr code). 

Despite All of those issues... It was an amazing hotel. I will be back 

 Brunch note: the brunch was mediocre at best.  I don't fault the Westin. They have a brunch that has a little bit of everything good, but nothing exceptional  Everyone I ate with had the same opportunity for growth.... Sauces. Some gravies ( white, brown, sausage), homemade bbq, some homemade Curries.,.The Westin could elevate their brunch by offering some good sauces. Dry meat due to having to sit under heat lampshades (Buffett) vs meat that can shine with a little sauce to bring the flavor.

The room was excessively hot and despite asking for the heating to be adjusted was told it was centrally set. The NYE buffet meal was not as good as previous years. If you‚Äôre placed upstairs it‚Äôs a lot of walking all night to access the bar, the better food options and to view the entertainment. Not something you really want to be doing all night. However, the place was well decorated and Gary Xu provided excellent service; providing drinks, ice to cool down, anything we needed.
You should also know If sat upstairs it‚Äôs impossible to hear the raffle draw, know when the entertainment starts (or as mentioned earlier, view it with ease), or access the dance floor easily.
I booked a crown deluxe room. The bedroom itself is spacious, well decorated, the bed is supremely comfortable with high quality linens. However the bathroom is tightly packed and small with very little vanity space for personal belongings such as makeup and hairbrush. I also wouldn‚Äôt use the bathrobes - scratchy and poor quality. 
In the morning I called for room service for breakfast and was told it was included in my room and to go downstairs. Due to most guests being part of the party the night before, arriving at breakfast downstairs I was greeted with a queue, followed by a shared long table (not a huge problem) but despite many food options listed the staff were so busy that replenishing popular items was not done when I arrived. The queue for breakfast when I left was through the atrium of the lower floor (about 50+ people). Check-out also was slow.

I guess what I‚Äôm overall saying is, the staff are polite and patient and work hard. The place is well decorated and has touches of high comfort but they come with lower quality goods or space in the room I had. I don‚Äôt think it was worth the premium price I paid for one night. The volume 
of one night guests didn‚Äôt help the experience either.

Service was good with badic English. The room was clean, but the shower room atcthe sauna area was dirty. I had tovtake my shower upstairs. Even the whirlpool had molds. Yuck. Disappointing amenities since pool.was under enovation when we arrived. It was not a memorable dtay, definity not coming back. I think this hotel is overrated.

I am an interior designer, and I found that the design of the room, especially the bathroom, is very thoughtful and humane. Many details have inspired me a lot. The very famous Westin bed is as good as its reputation, very comfortable!

I will definitely return to the Westin Shanghai next time!

The mattress was very good and comfortable. The bedding was quite high-end. The view from the room was also very good, with a panoramic view of the Bund three-piece set.
In addition, I would like to make a small suggestion. I personally think it is not reasonable to put a scale in front of the toilet. The toilet space itself is a bit cramped. When sitting on the toilet, there is no place to put the left foot...

Although the breakfast was not as varied as the large restaurant on the first floor, it was concise (actually there were quite a few, and all the necessary types were available). The ingredients were fresh and tasted good. Dinner was a simple meal with free drinks. There were not many people at breakfast and dinner, and the dining environment was good. The room was consistent with the introduction of Ctrip, so I didn't take any more photos. The hygiene was very good, the bedding was comfortable, the room service was thoughtful, and the things I called were delivered quickly. The hotel is in a good location. Turn right at the door and walk to Guangdong Road in ten minutes to the Bund. There is an indoor swimming pool on the third floor of the hotel, equipped with a sauna. The best thing is that there is a dryer to dry swimsuits, which is so friendly. This stay experience was great. Thank you for the upgraded sales by the handsome guy at the front desk. Although some extra fees were added, I felt that it was worth the money and made our vacation more perfect.

Facilities: Not bad, especially the shower in the bathroom, which has the amount of water I like.
Hygiene: The hygiene of five-star hotels is still very guaranteed.
Environment: Because most of them are business travelers, the environment is good and the hotel is not noisy.
Service: The service is very good. I will call the day before check-in to communicate the check-in time and check-in preferences. Because I am raising a child alone, the lady at the front desk upgraded my room on the day of check-in. Thank you very much, and thank you very much for helping me. The luggage lady is beautiful and gentle.
The location is very close to the Bund, just a few minutes walk, very convenient.
To sum up, it is a good choice for traveling in Shanghai.
But there was a fly in the ointment. When the car dropped me at the door of the hotel, no one came to open the door. The driver opened the trunk and gestured to take the luggage, but hesitated. When I got off the car and told him to take the luggage again, he reluctantly took it down. I put it down and left. I was dragging a lot of luggage and two children by myself, and no one came to help. Then I saw the doorman helping a foreigner to pull a suitcase. It was indeed a very lively atmosphere. If it weren't for the gentle and enthusiastic service of the young lady at the front desk, I would have turned around and left.

Later, the manufacturing industry was concentrated in Guangdong, and customers and bosses all came and went. This time, it was the last leg of a business trip in Zhejiang, and I came to Shanghai to take a plane back to the United States. I took a half-day break and strolled around the Bund, a landmark of Shanghai. The service quality has been very good for decades, and the soft power is still there. If there is no special demand or requirement, it is highly likely that nothing will go wrong.

The hotel is very good overall, with a first-class location. It only takes 5 to 10 minutes to walk to the Bund. Although the appearance is a bit old and not as beautiful as other Westins, the room feels relatively new. In addition, the restaurant is in the middle of the lobby. Looking up through the large glass roof of the restaurant, you can see the high-rise buildings wrapped around the hotel reaching into the sky. The view is great. In addition, parking is very convenient, with many empty parking spaces, which is not easy in the Bund. The parking lot also has super charging, and it is very convenient to charge the tram. In short, the service, location, view, charging and parking are all great

The only complaint is the Chinese restaurant on the 5th floor of the hotel.

But when we eat, they insist that we order tea or other wine. We brought our own wine, but we had no choice but to order tea, and foreigners are not used to it, so I complained...

msg:I stayed at the Westin Hotel in Shanghai this time because of my aunt's 100th birthday party. I originally booked connecting rooms, but my wife wanted to change to an executive room. So I came to the front desk, and Miss Wu from the front desk received me. She first arranged for someone to take me to see the room, then checked the room, and then went through the procedures for me to change the room. Our event this time was a big family, and it was all thanks to Miss Wu that we had good accommodation and good food. Thank you again.

He specially arranged a room with a great view for our family of four and gave two children free breakfast. He learned that we had just returned to the city from Disney. When we were tired from playing in the area, we thoughtfully extended the check-out time. It felt like home! The room is spacious and comfortable, and what's even more surprising is that you can see the Oriental Pearl Tower. The breakfast was rich and delicious. The service staff were polite and thoughtful, and proactively asked about my needs. I was very satisfied!

Environment and facilities: Although it is an older hotel, the internal facilities are well maintained. It may be better if more fragrances can be added to improve the smell inside the old hotel.

Location: It is within walking distance from the Bund, Yu Garden and Nanjing Road, which is very convenient and also solves the parking problem.

Meals: Dinner and breakfast are both in the hotel. The chef of the hotel is great. The variety is not rich, but the taste and quality of the food are indeed well grasped. It has been a long time since I had such a good dining experience in a hotel of the same level.

On the first day I checked in, I booked a room with a window, but I was given a room with glass. A room (a whole wall of glass that cannot be ventilated, causing the air in the room to be too bad), is this called a window? They were very good at confusing people. They changed my room the next day at my insistence. After the change, I asked the front desk to change the bed sheets and quilts in the room. The front desk staff assured me that they would change them every day and wait for me. When I got to the room, the sheets still had melon seed shells that the person in front of me knocked on and even human body hair on them. Is this called changing?
   In short, it‚Äôs nothing but bad. I forgot to take a photo, otherwise I would have wanted to sue him for fraudüòÖ

It was during the Spring Festival travel period and tickets were hard to buy. So we temporarily adjusted part of the itinerary and made Shanghai the first stop of the trip. When choosing a hotel, I decisively chose the Westin. The location is very good, with convenient transportation. It is very close to Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street, the Bund, and Yuyuan Garden. It only takes about 20 minutes to walk. The hotel environment is very good, the room is very square, and the hygiene is very clean. Unfortunately, I forgot to take a picture of the room. Finally, let me talk about the service. Two details moved me very much. First, after checking in in the afternoon, I opened the door to boil water because Two rooms were opened. After I boiled the water, when I went to the elderly room, I met a cleaning guy in the corridor. He took the initiative to ask me if I needed mineral water and immediately brought 4 bottles of water. Second, on the first day before our trip, Claire, the deputy guest relations manager of the Westin Hotel, took the initiative to contact me to handle room check-in and room upgrade for us. After check-in, she asked about our stay and offered help. I was very touched and it was a worthwhile trip. Next time I have the opportunity to go to Shanghai, I will stay at the WestinüòÄüòÄüòÄ

msg:Among the more famous hotels in the Bund area, I compared several on Ctrip and chose the Westin.
Environment: It is on the side of the main traffic road, so it is very convenient to drive or take the subway. It is also very close to the Bund, so it is very convenient to travel around and dine, relax and shop.
Hygiene: The hotel lobby, passages, elevators and rooms are all clean and have no odor. There are no hairs left by previous guests on the sofa, bed, floor and shower drain in the room, indicating that the cleaning work is quite thorough.
Facilities: The hotel facilities and equipment should be relatively old, and some supplies and equipment are not suitable for a hotel of this quality. The wardrobe in the executive building room is wrinkled and not smooth enough. The toilet water is not flowing smoothly. The hair dryer is too old. Nowadays, all the bathing centers in Beijing and Northeast China use Dyson hair dryers... Another suggestion is that it is best for hotels of this level to be equipped with smart toilet seats. I personally think this is very important. I went to Xiamen three years ago. Villas and B&Bs all have smart toilet seats.
Service: The service is very considerate. After responding to some problems, the front desk and customer service have responded with messages and phone calls. They attach great importance to customer feelings. Very satisfied with this. Claire, the front desk manager, also made thoughtful adjus**ents to the room arrangements when checking in. Thank you so much.
Overall, I'm quite satisfied.

The swimming pool was said to have just been cleaned and opened on the first day. The lifeguard service was good and he would ask for water and towels. I stayed one night this time and will try the treadmill next time. There were a lot of people at breakfast, but it didn't feel crowded.

The room was old and shabby, it was so hot at night that it was uncomfortable to breathe, and there was a stuffy smell! Let's open the windows to let some air in. The PM2.5 outside is so high that a yellow alert has been issued. No matter what you think, you can't even borrow an air purifier. After charging my mobile phone for a long time, it didn't charge, and I discovered that the socket was loose. I could only drink half a cup of black tea for breakfast and the food was unpalatable. On the first day of the new year, I didn‚Äôt even say hello when I checked out, so I should say hello to her first! Chatting in dialect in front of customers and ignoring them is such a disrespectful work attitude! Prices went crazy on New Year's Eve, the lobby was a mess, there were so many Westins, this one was the worst.

This time I came to Shanghai for a business trip to the Bund, and I specially booked the Westin Hotel. Because the clients I visited and the entertainment were all around the Bund, the location is very convenient. The last time I stayed at the Westin Hotel Shanghai was in December 2013, which is 10 years agoüòÄ
This time, from check-in, to the entire 2-day experience, to final check-out, everything was perfect, and the service is still very reliable. Especially when checking in, the front desk lady Claire Wu asked me about my check-in preferences and tried her best to meet my requirements. The arrangements were very good and she also recommended the executive lounge service. We were very happy with the experience. The aunt who cleans the guest room is also very considerate and brings many bottles of mineral water every time. Overall, it is very good. I will come back to the Westin Hotel again when I come to the Bund in Shanghai.

But what makes me uncomfortable is that their restaurant manager has separate services. He doesn't pay much attention to black people when he sees them, and only pays attention to white customers. I saw him like this for several days in a row. How old is this? Do you still have such unprofessional and tacky ideas? Where is the demeanor of Greater China?

Secondly, the bedding is too damp and makes sleeping very uncomfortable. Go to the buffet on the first floor and get a breakfast for free. Breakfast is OK. Guests can get a 30% discount on the dinner buffet, which costs about 300 yuan per person. The taste is generally a bit stale, with some seafood being stale. Frozen crabs and fried prawns are obviously dead shrimps and are not recommended to be eaten. Others are OK because The location of the hotel was ideal, so I booked it for 3 nights in a row. I couldn't cancel. When I was able to check out on the last day, I immediately changed to the Shangri-La Hotel opposite. I won't consider staying there again.

It's the Mid-Autumn Festival, and there are a lot of people during the National Day, but the management is only in good order. There are mooncakes in the lobby for guests to eat, which is very festive.
Special thanks to Ms. An, the deputy front office manager, for arranging rooms for me and my friends, making my stay very comfortable.
The service provided by Ms. Yao and Ms. Wu at the front desk was very professional.
The housekeeping colleagues were careful and patient in cleaning. The whole room was cleaned very clean and they also gave small gifts.
Manager Sun in the Chinese restaurant is very enthusiastic and provides excellent service.
Manager Zhang from the food delivery depar**ent also prepared a special welcome gift, and the service was very professional and nice.
The service of the entire team made my impression of this hotel increase. Next time I stay at a hotel, Westin will be my first choice.

Because I often stay at the Westin Hotel in Sanya, I took my children and elderly people out this time and chose the same hotel in Shanghai. There are many foreign guests in the hotel. The customer quality is high, and the service staff is also very good. From the front desk to the room service staff, everyone is very satisfied. Because I booked three rooms, something was missing when I checked out. Joey, a handsome guy who was on vacation, took the trouble to help me contact him. The hotel arranged for Anna to help me courier the bracelet back to its original owner. I was very touched. I am quite satisfied with the hotel's facilities and equipment. In Shanghai, where land is at a premium, the room space is quite large. I think it is mainly close to the pedestrian street and the Bund, so it is the best choice for Huangpu District. The hotel's buffet is also very satisfying. Be sure to try the dessert in the picture. It's delicious. Don't miss it. The overall hotel recommendation index is five stars! Thanks again to handsome Joey, Anna.

1. The doorman was very lazy. He didn't take the initiative to take the luggage when the guests got off the car with a lot of luggage! The driver who rushed us was in a hurry. Why didn't he rush the *** who was soliciting business at the door? ! Is he waiting for the police to catch him?
2. There is only UND CENTER on the pillar at the entrance of the hotel. Is there no B installed? !
3. The shower faucet regulator in the room bathroom is stuck.
4. The toilet in the room is leaking.
Shanghai is the image of China, and the hotel is the facade of Shanghai. Such a hotel is not as good as those in second-tier cities. Except for the location advantage, there is nothing else. It's time to strengthen management!

You can't find the floor button, and if your card swipe times out, you will be taken to another place. The room number sign is small and lackluster, so be careful about entering the wrong room. The large door of the bathroom in the room is directly facing the sleepy bed, imitating the classical folk toilet and being carried beside the bed. The cafeteria is like watching a social opera in the ancient countryside. There are steps everywhere. Eating a meal is like going to a gym. There is nothing to eat. I jump up and down and worry about knocking over the basin and spraining my ankle. Seeing the truth in the smallest details is unforgettable.

First of all, because I didn't bring my ID card, the guy at the front desk couldn't provide an electronic ID card or a photo. Well, that's the rule, so we just abide by it. I waited for almost 20 minutes and was told that I could check in. When I entered the room, there was only one robe for the standard room. The slippers were of the same quality as those of Four Seasons. The toothbrush pricked my mouth because I asked for a buckwheat pillow at the front desk, but it didn't arrive. I started to call, but there was no response when I pressed the phone. I couldn't make a call at all. The phone number on the Ctrip interface was expired. The Westin phone number on ** was different. I couldn't find it at 114. Finally, I still found it by asking the buffet for information. I called and the pillow was delivered. I reported the problem. The manager on duty called and said that it was available. He said to press 0. OK, I need a charger. I called again and still no sound. That means it doesn't work. Forget it. It's too late and I don't need anything. I was still looking forward to breakfast. My girlfriend and I went there and told her that it was a good experience last time. But the breakfast was not as good as last year. There were fewer varieties and no fresh squeezed food. The Chinese dishes were even worse. There were no three kinds of vegetables or tofu pudding. I'm really sorry that the price doesn't match the quality. The experience is very bad.

msg:The facilities in the room are old. The small lamps on both sides of the bed and floor lamps cannot be used. The air conditioner is noisy. The lights in the room cannot be switched on and off. The spotlights above the bed cannot adjust the brightness. There is no hot water in the bathroom washbasin faucet. Renovation and rectification are needed as soon as possible. Bar!
The check-in reception was very good. When checking out, the breakfast charge could not be entered into the system in time. The front desk encountered a problem when issuing invoices. The front desk reception did not quickly confirm and solve the problem, but kept telling me that the system did not enter it, which caused a delay in invoicing. Xiaoxiao The internal problems are always pushed to the guests, which is not the level of a five-star hotel, and the overall experience of the stay is lowered! ! !

I didn't sleep well all night, I said I could see the night view, but just a little bit, lying on the glass and squinting! Three stars are not considered, the quilt is just a thin sheet with a quilt on it! It's too unhygienic to encounter such a piece of paper! Dust is everywhere! It's just a mentality to go in, check out early and leave, the price is not worth it! For the same price, the view on the 54th floor of Conrad's executive floor is particularly good! Very satisfied, clean and with a view! Everyone avoid lightning! 1 point is too much! I don't know where it deserves this point. If it is said that the elevator must be very fast!

It is indeed an old five-star hotel in the prime location of the Bund in Shanghai. I am particularly satisfied with the express service center of the hotel. There is only one person in the room. Just call, you can consult everything you want to know, including the facilities inside the hotel and travel guides around the hotel (very professional), and they will also carefully help me deliver the sex products, water, bath towels, and coffee I need , tea...it can be called omnipotent. By the way, the operator who answered the phone is called Amy. She has a sweet voice and considerate service. I hope you can also feel her high-quality service üëçüëçüëç

The price is also reasonable , There is no strict requirement on check-out time, self-service refund is fine without invoicing, I haven‚Äôt been to Shanghai for many years, I don‚Äôt know if toothbrushes are provided, but I will still provide them if I ask the hotel, less than ten minutes walk from the Bund, traffic convenient

You can see the Bund at close range from the room, and you can go downstairs to the Bund. Nanjing Road is less than a quarter of an hour away. It's very close... The front desk is really slow, probably because there are many foreigners. It's understandable. Before the deposit, I saw that it was difficult to get the money. I haven't encountered such a situation. It took less than half an hour for the check-out procedure to arrive... and the parking problem was so cool, I drove directly into the underground parking lot, and the underground parking lot is also very large, so we were delayed by two hours after check-out Hours are free... The room I booked has a large bathtub, and I bring a disposable bathtub cover. There is also a large window next to the bathtub to see the Bund... Every waiter has a smile on his face Smile and say hello, all in all a good night's sleep... The breakfast is too rich and delicate. After eating, I found that there is still a row of delicacies that I didn't visit when I came to the exit. It's a pity that I ate too much, hehe.. . . . .

msg:1. There was dirt in the bathtub. After contacting the hotel staff, they arranged for cleaning but it could not be removed. Later, they sent snacks and red wine and arranged for the staff to come to apologize, but it left a knot in my heart. There was no comfort at all for two days of accommodation.

2. The hotel equipment is old, 1300/night, not worth the money.

3. Someone guided us to sit down for breakfast, but so what? The seat was still occupied, and the meal I took was thrown to another table. I was also sprayed by the next table after returning to the seat, saying that I occupied the seat randomly. The restaurant staff apologized and gave the restaurant suggestions for improvement. ***, there was no improvement the next day, but a staff member came to me with a rag doll and a notebook to apologize again. Looking at the dining order, the sound of the waves remained the same, which was extremely disappointing.

I feel that the hotel's apology culture is good, but the execution of problem improvement is obviously insufficient. It is not far from picking stars. This is a hotel with problems in operation and management.

The room facilities are old, the curtains are very old, and there is no main switch for various lights. I turned off all the lights several times before going to bed, but still could not turn off the small bedside light. The switch also failed and could only stay on for one night.
The water flow from the sink faucet was very unfriendly and accidentally splashed all over the floor. When I soaked in the bathtub, it felt very stable and felt like it was about to collapse at any moment.
Anyway, I feel that the service facilities are not worthy of the Marriott brand, but the location is really good. No wonder many foreigners stay there.

I asked us to go to the front desk halfway through the meal, and someone at the front desk checked out and kept me waiting. When I got to the front desk, I was asked to find a restaurant. The result was pushed back and forth like this. Obviously it was your mistake, you all took out your mobile phone to book the information, and you pushed back and forth.

If you are driving, get off the Yan'an Elevated Road and turn left. Secondly, the small shops in the nearby business district are very convenient for eating and shopping, and it is very close to the Bund, Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street, Yuyuan Garden. The hotel is positioned in a business style, swimming pool gym, conference room business banquet hall are equipped, not bad. The ladies at the front desk, Claire and Tiffany, served very well. They were warm and thoughtful and considered our check-in needs. They helped arrange an upgrade for the room. They were very satisfied and made our stay very happy! Both business proficiency and response speed are online, meeting the five-star standard! Walking near the Bund after dinner, the big lotus flowers are everywhere at night. It is really a scene on the Bund, even more eye-catching than the World Architecture Expo Group! If I want to come back to Shanghai in the future, I will still choose this hotel!

Went directly to the airport from the hotel and made sure that nothing was taken away.
I contacted the hotel and Ctrip as soon as possible. I didn‚Äôt see it when the hotel was cleaning up the room, nor did the guests who checked in. So where did such a big thing go?
The equipment is relatively expensive and the police have been called, waiting for the police to deal with it.

In the end, I lost my luggage and called the hotel and told me that I found it. There were children's bracelets (1000+) and some sundries. The lady on the other end of the phone said contemptuously what these things were. I couldn't understand what they were Does it work...can't remember.
I said that I need to add my WeChat to send it back, and then there is no more. No one answered the phone either.
Afterwards, I contacted Ctrip to help me find me, and told me that there were no missing items, and I said there were! Then help me confirm what the hotel told me! Afterwards, the hotel was very domineering to Ctrip's customer service and told me that they would contact me if they didn't need Ctrip to intervene...so~ I'm the innocent one, okay? I'm speechless.
In the end, I contacted me, and then something more speechless came! SF's customer service phone number was given to me, and I actually placed an order for myself, and it was sent from point A to point A. Then, I paid two room rates of 1900. The hotel actually needs the customer to pay for the express fee of 12 yuan.
It's not the first time I've left something behind. I've never seen such a hotel that doesn't take the initiative to contact and has to ask for it repeatedly. I've never seen such an ugly food. Will not live again.
But the lobby is beautiful. Breakfast is average. Then we went to Shangri-La. The price is almost definitely the Shangri-La.

As a first-tier hotel brand in the world, from the time of check-in, there is no staff who greets you proactively and asks if you need help. No staff took the initiative to help you with your large luggage... and a series of problems followed. Not to mention the room, the water pressure of the shower, the old and stained lamp on the table, makes people feel cold, not to mention the welcome fruit, snacks and drinks. If you want to drink, please open the small refrigerator and charge according to the price. The breakfast is even more messy, disorganized and with very few varieties. To sum up, in the end, the Westin, which lives in Chongqing, is far from the Nth power of one hundred and eight thousand miles. This is also the worst hotel I have ever stayed in in a first-tier brand.

The char bar upstairs is also recommended, and the front desk staff are also very enthusiastic. I highly recommend this hotel. The only downside is that there is no subway station nearby.

The location of the hotel is excellent, you can walk to the Bund and Nanjing Road, and appreciate the customs of the Republic of China and the modernization of Pudong. The hotel swimming pool is facing the three-piece suite, and there is also a soaking pool, which is very comfortable, and there are not many people coming, but the opening hours are too short, and I hope that the opening hours will be at least until 11 pm. The breakfast is rich in Western style, but the Chinese style is not good enough. I hope to add Chinese stir-fried dishes and Shanghai snacks. At least raw fried food should be standard. Stayed for two days, the service staff are very friendly. Have a chance to come again.

msg:One of the choices for this trip to Shanghai, the experience is still comfortable
Room service is slightly flawed, but overall very good
It's suitable for business travel and tourism. It's very recommended

Location traffic:

The location is the most surprising. It's on the Bund. It's convenient
Calling a car to go anywhere nearby is very fast. It feels great to be connected in all directions.
The U-turn around the hotel and entering and exiting the internal area of the hotel is a bit detoured
There is a slight delay in traveling, but it is generally okay

Room facilities:

The executive suite is still quite online and has played well in all aspects
The facilities are quite complete, especially the bathroom facilities are all online
It's a bit surprising and embarrassing that the bathroom is an oversized mirror
The rain shower facilities are good, the hot water is online 24 hours a day, and the water volume is gratifying
The bedding and sound insulation are also quite online, and the whole experience is extremely comfortable
Room size, pattern design, including lighting and landscape are also impeccable
It is indeed an old-fashioned good hotel that is very online.

Serve:

There is a slight flaw in the service, although other experiences are online
But the guest rooms are not well stocked for small parts like HDMI cables
The access to WiFi is also not smooth enough
Switching to IT costs a lot of twists and turns
Front desk may be busy near check-out
Call Center No Answers
It feels a bit awkward to try several calls but no one serves
Appearing in the administrative building, especially should not need to be improved

It is very convenient to take a boat to the Bund, People's Square or Shiliupu Pier. In fact, it is very convenient to take a taxi during the day, but there will be traffic jams at night. It is close to various places, so you can save it at night. After a long journey, we walked back. I booked a Crown Business Twin Room with a large living room and a imperial concubine sofa perfect for watching the Asian Games. The six bottles of water in the room were enough for a day's drinking outside, and they were filled again when we returned to the hotel. Two large windows can see the Aurora Tower in Lujiazui opposite. The breakfast is very rich and very appetizing for children. It's a pity that I didn't make a reservation at the Michelin restaurant. I'll come back next time.

The service awareness was very poor. Finally, I changed the room. The rooms are barely adequate. It‚Äôs one of the worst five-star hotels I‚Äôve ever stayed in in first- and second-tier cities! The room fee of 1500 plus is not worth it now when I think about it.

msg:Overall, the experience of staying here is average. Compared with other cities, the Westin is relatively old. The recommendation index is three and a half stars.
After all, it is a five-star hotel. Let me talk about the advantages first:
1. The room is big
2. Close to the Bund and convenient transportation
3. The hygienic environment is very good, and the sound insulation is acceptable, but the sound of the door closing is a bit loud
Now for the less-than-satisfactory part:
1. It was early morning on the day of check-in, and there was no one at the front desk. I waited for a while to find the front desk on duty to check in.
2. Toothbrush and toothpaste are not available in the room, you need to ask for it at the front desk
3. It has been open for a long time, although the middle has been renovated, the overall facilities are very old
4. Small details: there is no place to put mobile phones in the toilet, which is very unreasonable
5. There is no shoe shine cloth. I called the front desk several times and no one answered.
6. The location of this TV is a bit inhumane, you can‚Äôt watch it while lying on the bed (cover your face)
7. The hair dryer works sometimes and sometimes not
Above, the next time I go, I may choose a four-star hotel with a relatively new opening time

Let me transfer to a higher floor, Daisy to the 26th floor, the fan is too big to bear. The air conditioner is also not heating. Later transferred to another floor, the bathtub in the room is shown in the picture. I went back to the hotel at night and told the night shift manager that it would be too late to solve it in the morning. Then don't come in the morning. The only manager who experienced the final checkout and leaving said a thoughtful word. If it weren't for the apology and sincerity of the manager Anna, I really think the overall service of Westin can be called epic scum.
I have lived in Kempinski, Ritz-Carlton, Sheraton, Hilton, this Westin, and will not come again in Shanghai. If you want a good experience, the others are good.

msg:I helped customers make reservations. It was a five-star chain that was clean and hygienic. Customers were quite satisfied with it. The location was also very good and it was convenient to travel. The customer‚Äôs reaction was that the buffet dinner categories were a bit lacking. However, the hotel is still very good. The lobby is very beautiful as soon as you enter. Overall, I am satisfied.

msg:It took almost 50 minutes from entering the lobby to checking in. There was a queue all the time. It wasn't because there were a lot of guests, it was really slow. I even waited in line for 10 minutes and I was speechless. Also, why does the lobby manager ask customers if they have black diamonds or something? They can handle it specially on the 5th floor. Otherwise, there is no other way. The work efficiency is so low that I will not check in next time. I still care about the level of the customers. The hotel is also very old. It‚Äôs old. There‚Äôs nothing left for breakfast at 9:30, and some of it tastes really bad. I visited 20 or 30 hotels during the summer vacation. There is no doubt that this one is really not good.

msg:The Westin in Shanghai's iconic Bund Center must come to check in.
Environment: The overall environment is noble and clean, and the lobby has a high degree of beauty. Yitian Gallery has a strong sense of design.

Service: The reception in the front hall is particularly commendable üëç Especially Tiffany's smile made us feel very kind and patient. He answered our questions and introduced the hotel. My mother also praised her for her professionalism and elegance. When checking in, my mother failed the ID card verification at the beginning, but she was still patient and not impatient. She checked us in as soon as possible in an orderly manner, and it was the same for other guests. I hope Westin can continue to make us feel at home~
Room type: We live in the Crown Building, the floor height is moderate. Although we asked Tiffany to arrange a room closer to the elevator for the convenience of family travel, there is almost no sound insulation problem! And the city view outside the window is also unique.

Facilities: The room facilities are complete, the sanitation is ok, and the bed surface is neat and clean. Friends can rest assured~

msg:The only advantage is that the location is okay, others are very poor.
Service: 1. The attitude of the front desk is not good, the attitude of the concierge is not good, and the communication skills are poor. I sent a cake in a flash to ask the hotel to help put down the refrigerator in advance. Such a simple matter was transferred from the front desk to the concierge, and it was not handled well in the end.
2. It takes a long time to queue up for check-in and check-out. There are two or three people at the counter, but there is no one to guide the queue, and there is no fast channel for check-out. The service awareness is weak
3. The room service phone was not connected in a timely manner, and there was no ice bucket when I asked for ice cubes..

Facilities: The old ones can't be any older.... The kettle and TV cabinet are very old, the curtains have serious light leakage, the hot and cold water in the bathroom is not clearly marked, the drawer for the wine glass, the pad underneath is broken, and the wardrobe door is broken It is broken, and the placement and opening position are unreasonable, and the cabinet door cannot be opened to hang clothes, which is also a problem. There are many problems, not just the ones I mentioned, and these problems are not like the standard that Westin should have in my impression.

Environment: The corridor is very narrow and the floor height is very low, estimated to be only 2m3. It feels very depressing, like a temporary auxiliary building. . The carpet was dirty, not what a 5 star hotel should look like anyway.

The room service phone was called several times and no one answered. The next day, I told the front desk and changed the river view. A little distance from the Bund, only a little water can be seen. The rooms are very small. There are too few breakfast varieties, and it is incomparable with the breakfasts of InterContinental, Wanda, and W. This time I took my children to play in Shanghai, this is the first time I live in Shanghai Westin, and I feel bad. There is still a gap between five stars. Would not recommend to friends.

msg:I booked it for two nights for a relative. The room layout was very strange. The relative went to the front desk to spend money to upgrade the room type. When upgrading, he told the front desk that he wanted to stay one more night. As a result, after the 2 nights expired, the front desk called me asking to check out. It turned out that the front desk did not apply for an extension. At that time, my relatives were away and could not rush back to the hotel. So after the deposit was withheld, the luggage left in the hotel was packed and placed at the front desk. , it is not yet known whether any items are missing. Because the relative is a girl, Disney has not yet received the luggage, so I have to ask my classmates to handle it first. I have stayed at Westin in other cities many times before and felt that the service was very good, so I also booked this hotel for my relative. Originally, it was for convenience and service. I did not expect that the Westin on the Bund in Shanghai would treat Ctrip customers like this. I will never stay here again! I have never given any negative reviews, and Ctrip‚Äôs first negative review was given to Westin Shanghai on the Bund!

msg:The sequel to the last review. I guess the hotel's service idea is: Although the abnormal noise at night makes you insomnia, if you don't look for me, I won't look for you. After 9 o'clock in the morning of the next day, I didn't receive any explanation from the hotel. Contacted Ctrip, Ctrip was unable to contact the hotel customer service again. Finally, leave a phone call and wait for the hotel to call. Called half an hour later, the solution continued its magic, saying I could rest in my room until 5pm. please! I am traveling, you give me this plan, let everyone evaluate it to see if it is suitable? Since the itinerary was affected, I thought about whether to ask about the continuation of the stay, and then change the hotel. This time the itinerary is definitely not ideal. At this time, the customer service manager also showed his sincerity by upgrading the room and adding breakfast. And called me when it was arranged. I originally thought that there should be a proper arrangement for the previous episode. Go back to the hotel at night, take the room card and enter the room. The room actually smells of cigarettes, which immediately convinces you. Let‚Äôs not mention other minor problems with the facilities. Although the customer service manager left a message to contact me at any time if I have any questions, I really don't have any hope. The type and quality of breakfast is not very good, if you need to spend money, it is recommended not to buy it.

Its "big pineapple" has a unique shape and can be seen from a distance. The layout of the hotel rooms is also very good. It's pretty good, the space is big enough, very suitable for family outings, you can see the Bund and the Pearl Tower when you open the curtains in the room, the hotel's breakfast is also quite rich, Chinese and Western styles can be chosen by the guests, the supplies are also timely, and the service of the staff is excellent The attitude is also very good. One thing I am not satisfied with is that the waiting time for check-in is a bit long, probably because of the Spring Festival holiday, there are more people checking in.

msg:It can't be any worse. Only those who have stayed at the Westin Shanghai can understand what despair and anger are. If I can give a negative score, I really won't give even one point.
Service: Check-in in the lobby is so slow, there is no so-called service at all. The revolving door of such a big hotel is so simple that I thought it was a fast hotel. No matter how much luggage you take, the waiter in the lobby who looks like a statue just looks at you.
Facilities: My house built in the 1990s is not so old. One of the two indoor phones is broken! The bathroom smells like urine, and I actually smelled the same smell in the fruit area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe restaurant. I was shocked and didn't dare to eat breakfast fruit!
Restaurant: Breakfast is so crowded that you think you have come to a refugee camp. I am afraid that people around me will laugh at the food and say that you didn't take pictures of this breakfast. You didn't take pictures because you didn't eat anything. After eating, it's gone and you won't be replenished. It's extremely dirty and bad. Not as good as the breakfast in the guesthouse! All the restaurants and bars in the hotel are gone at 9:00.
Room: My 1000+ room was a cold mountain, with air leaks everywhere, the air conditioner was blowing hot air but it was useless, and the curtains were always fluttering. There was no waste basket next to the toilet, but every time you took a ****, it would get blocked, so blocked that you doubted your life, water and feces came out, and there were pictures to prove it!! You called the front desk, but either no one answered, or they told you that the waiters were off work, and you asked him to find the manager to solve it. She told me that the manager was on the way to my room for an hour and a half and didn't arrive. I helplessly watched the feces water flowing all over the floor and went downstairs to find that all kinds of managers gathered in the lobby and didn't know anything about my matter, and they kept quibbling and denying! I was angry, I swore, I reported it, I called the police!!! They are not worthy of Shanghai!!
I will never choose Westin and all its products and services again in my life.

When we checked in, the front desk saw that we were taller with children, so we took the initiative to upgrade the room type, and the staff were very enthusiastic.
Disadvantages: The facilities are too old, and it feels like the decoration of the 90s. It may be because the toilet and shower space are very, very small and cannot be turned around because of the geographical location where every inch of land is precious. The quilts given in winter are not soft and thick duvets like other five-star hotels, but the air-conditioning quilts are covered with a quilt cover. If you want to add an extra quilt, you can only give two quilt covers due to the large number of guests staying. The air conditioner is adjusted to 28 degrees. But I always feel cold when I sleep; the noise of the air conditioner roaring outside the bedroom window is more obvious in the middle of the night. I feel that I will not choose or recommend it to my friends next time.

They came after 11 o'clock. The key point was that the children were asleep. The cleaning staff pressed the doorbell and we did not respond. We got ready to get dressed and open the door. I haven't put on my clothes yet, but the cleaning staff just swiped the master card to enter the room and loudly asked what was unclean.

msg:Very bad stay experience! ! ! I booked a twin room (two 1.2-meter-wide beds), I dragged my luggage and brought my two children to the Westin Shanghai on the Bund at night, checked in after a very tiring journey, and the front desk staff informed me that there was a change in the room I upgraded, and after a lot of tossing around, I realized that I could upgrade to a double bed room. The hotel changed again, and after another round of tossing, it was still a double bed room. Yes, a mattress was pulled over from the back. The room was too small and I couldn‚Äôt add it in. Three people arranged a bed for me. The child caught a cold and I also caught a cold while sleeping on the sofa. I used the room phone to call the front desk three times. The attitude was very bad. Solution, there are many foreigners in this hotel, it serves foreigners, it is very unfriendly to Chinese people and has no service! ! ! I took a video, the hotel waiter ran to help a 185-meter-tall foreigner, I dragged my luggage and brought my child to see this scene, I was so disgusted, I suggest that you really don‚Äôt stay in this hotel, enjoy the 1500-night room If there is no service, ask ten questions and roll your eyes and answer, all the waiters are busy greeting foreigners,
(I received a call from the hotel on the way back. The hotel was worried that I would give a bad review, and kept explaining that I was too busy, too busy to help a foreigner push his luggage, bad review! bad review! bad review!)

In addition, seeing that we have children, we also offered to add a baby cot, but unfortunately the baby cot is more suitable for children who can already stand, and our baby is only three months old. This height is not suitable for it.

The hotel began to claim that it had not received my deposit, and later said it was a bank failure. Now that 20% of the 21st century has passed, the Weibo and WeChat servers have been repaired overnight when they crashed. What kind of catastrophic failure takes so long to recover? If the refund is unsuccessful, you can withdraw it and then refund it! The bank is abroad? Can't you make a trip in person to settle the account! Typical lazy inaction, complaints to 12345.
In addition, the hotel bathtub is very dirty. When you touch it with your hand, it is a layer of white dirt. It is obvious that the previous guests have not cleaned it after using it. The small snacks sent by the hotel, a few peanuts, and a very small cake, really might as well not be sent. The cord on the bedside phone is loose. In short everything is not worthy of a five-star service standard!
Regarding the refund of the deposit, I don't need to go to the bank. If we don't refund the money without any additional consumption, we will fight to the end!

However, we encountered the same problem when we checked in. As an old five-star hotel, the front desk service attitude was not complimentary, but they said If you are not satisfied, you can cancel. Basically no one answered the service call at the switchboard. I was told that there were no more children's slippers. The cabinet door did not close tightly, the window gaps were moldy, and the roof sprinkler was full of dust. As a Westin hotel, it is so disappointing.

First, I got the name of the order wrong, and after checking all the information with the front desk, I even gave a cheap room type. After finding out, I went to the front desk, called to communicate, and tried to evade each other with Ctrip. In the end, the price difference was refunded, and there was no compensation for the inconvenience caused. The room facilities are unreasonable, and the curtains in the bathroom need to climb into the bathtub to close them. There are too many people for breakfast, and there are very few varieties, which does not match the image of a five-star hotel.

I asked for a toothbrush and toothpaste, but only the toothbrush did not have toothpaste. After dinner, if I wanted to have a cup of coffee and a snack, I asked the concierge and said that the lobby on the first floor has a buffet dinner. I was asked to go to the fifth floor, and the fifth floor was told that it was full and there was no follow-up. The toilet toilet is broken, there has been noise at night, and the toilet floor is sticky. Quite dissatisfied, is this a Marriott? Regret choosing this hotel.

The lady at the front desk helped me upgrade the executive room for free, especially the younger brother of the concierge, Jason Wu, who was very busy every time he saw him, but he also helped me while he was busy. I answered and helped me recommend delicious and fun places. The service was very friendly. When I left on the last day, he even helped me take a taxi and put me on the bus.

Isn't your purpose customer first and making customers comfortable and satisfied? Or do you have to prove yourself wrong? Such a level turned out to be the foreman of a five-star hotel, speechless.

She has an excellent service attitude, kind words and arranged a satisfactory room. The manager, Tiffany, is skilled in business and answered all my questions patiently and meticulously. I have to sigh the old five-star service quality. Heart-warming, make people feel at home. During the stay, I have troubled Jimmy Zhang of the concierge for many times. This guy is really warm, thoughtful and tireless in serving our guests. Thank you very much! Having stayed in many five-star hotels, Westin's breakfast quality and environment are few and far between. The hotel swimming pool is especially recommended. The water temperature is just right. The swimming pool can see the Pudong three-piece suit. It is really beautiful to enjoy the scenery while swimming. The child said that he would come again next time. Since he booked other hotels in a hurry this time, he looked forward to seeing you at Westin next time!

When I got back to my room, I called to make sure I didn't want breakfast. Don't overcharge. Then the front desk attitude was too bad. As a result, when I checked out, the front desk deducted two days' breakfast from the deposit for no reason. 360 in total. I called to ask about the situation, they kept saying that the machine was broken, and I would reply later. I asked them to check the recording of the call. They also kept dragging. Just no refund. Didn't go to breakfast either. I really don't know how there is such a hotel that deducts money indiscriminately? The front desk of a star-rated hotel is so awkward? What about the service industry?

msg:Disappointing staying experience. The five-star hotel is focused on the details of hardware and software. Before I came here, I knew it was a long time ago, so I have lowered my expectations for the hardware, but I don‚Äôt know that the hardware here is not good and the service level is not good...
From arriving at the entrance of the hotel, no one helped carry the luggage; the check-in process was cumbersome and the waiting time was long, and the front desk staff were very busy and irritable. This anxiety could infect the passengers and was unprofessional; when it came to the room, the room was very small with almost no view; There is a pasta analogue on the floor tiles of the toilet; there is only one bathrobe, and the hook for hanging the bathrobe has been loosened; the bathtub is large, but the curtain has to be manually pulled over the bathtub. What kind of brain-dead design is this; the shower gel packaging can still have A hole, squeeze it out when used; the small shower head in the shower cannot be adjusted in height, and can only be hung on the buckle at the waist; the room still cannot bear the dust, which cannot be accepted in a five-star hotel room. There is a layer of dust on the cabinet, and I have to wipe it by myself; breakfast is ordinary, poor in similar five-star hotels... The breakfast waiter can't remember what table I ordered, holding a cup of hot black tea that I did not order and put it vigorously on me In front of me, I was shocked. There are so many people, there is only one counter to provide hot drinks, there are long lines, and the little waiter girl is on the verge of collapse;
There are also advantages, such as comfortable mattresses and pillows, and the lobby staff are still enthusiastic and professional. But these are the standards that a five-star hotel should have~ so there is nothing to boast about.
After reading everyone's earlier evaluations, many of the same problems have appeared for a long time, and the inaction of the customer service and management is the most terrible. Won't live again.

Originally, I had to check out and leave on the 7th, but it was closed after 9 am on the 7th. The hotel was in an orderly manner, and everyone waited quietly and obeyed the arrangement. During the period, the hotel cared and served the guests attentively. Three meals a day were delivered to the room. The food was good and the stay was comfortable. It is worthy of being an old-fashioned five-star hotel. Special compliments and thanks to the concierge, Jerry Wang and Jimmy Zhang! Due to the special physical condition of the family members, I communicated with them a lot. The two of them were enthusiastic, patient, and responsible. They answered questions and comforted us in a timely manner. They also tried to solve a big problem for us. I felt very warm. It was unblocked in less than two days. Although it was not long, I felt very deeply. Living here is very warm.

msg:The hotel is located near the Bund, the location is excellent. I checked in at the lounge on the fifth floor. Although the reception was an old employee, she didn't mention the hotel facilities and the member's welcome gift. It was obtained through her conversations with other employees. She might be in a hurry to have lunch. This has resulted in a decline in the quality of check-in services.
The guest room has been upgraded to the open-plan guest room of the Crown Building, which is spacious and reasonably arranged. The living room and the bedroom form a physical partition, which achieves the separation of movement and static. But when I first entered the room, the musty smell was more obvious, and the toilet was not running smoothly.
Breakfast is in the stage restaurant on the first floor. The dining area is scattered, the moving line is long, and some areas need to go up the stairs. It is very unfriendly to the elderly, the sick, the disabled, pregnant and other people. What is even more unfriendly is that there is no reception and coffee pouring. Some dishes were not clean, which is inappropriate for this hotel, which has always been a high-end image in the hearts of Shanghainese.
To sum up, as an old-fashioned hotel, it is a pity that it only sees the aging hardware accumulated over the years, but does not find the ingenuity of the service (it gives people the feeling of "old fritters" and choking to death).

There were only two people at the front desk to check-in (even if there are few people, the efficiency is still low). My girlfriend and my girlfriend lined up at two counters, each with only one customer in front of them, but we had been in line for more than 20 minutes, and long queues had already started behind us. When I entered the room, it seemed that this was the case. I could indeed see the Oriental Pearl Tower when I squint at a 60-degree angle. At first, I didn't see the price list of drinks, thinking that everything in the refrigerator could be drunk for free, but found the price list in another drawer, which was hidden, and was accidentally pitted. I opened a TV to watch the European Cup. The pixels were too bad. The camera showed close-ups of the players and their faces were muddy. It is now in 2021, and I can't accept it. Finally, to sum up, this place is only a four-star hotel. Because of its good location, it became a five-star. It was a disappointing experience. I'm really sorry for the four-digit price.

msg:Westin is going downhill, if you have requirements for the quality of stay, please don't come. The high traffic during the National Day holiday is not an excuse. You always have to prepare in advance when you do things, let alone a famous hotel? The receptionist can't do anything except let you swipe your card. There is no reminder about important things like breakfast time and location. The restaurant staff is even more tired. After sitting for 19 minutes, the tableware can't be put up, and accidentally bumped into the dishes. The pot was bleeding a bit. The waiter was asked to take a band-aid and was told that there is no band-aid in the entire hotel... It was very speechless, and I might think it was impossible to use a disinfectant wipe to prevaricate... It was ridiculous! The swimming pool is old and very small. Rescuers are sitting and chatting in casual clothes. If there is an emergency, do they have to change their clothes and come to save people? Westin who is so speechless... will never come again

If I didn't keep reminding me, would the deposit not be refunded? This kind of critical service link will cause such a big problem, which shows how bad the operating system behind the hotel is! ! !

msg:The location is unique! Service standards! 1. The front desk staff has a very good attitude and explained it to me. It seems that I have opened a high-floor room for you with good lighting. When you go to the room, it is a special-shaped room in a corner. I want to face the Bund. It doesn't matter if it fails. Second, room service, the waiter should lack the mastery of the room status. A room attendant wants to go to an empty room. The standardized service knocks on the door and shouts loudly: Hello, waiter, hello, waiter, hello, waiter! I thought knocking on my room, opened the door, and asked the waiter, did you call me? The waiter smiled awkwardly: No. 3. In the room I lived in, the curtain on the bathtub was opened and closed for a long time, but I couldn't find it. I stepped on the bathtub and found that the curtain rope was in a groove. The convenience of the guests was not taken into consideration at all! 4. For breakfast, there are two seats in a row. It is inconvenient for guests to get in and out. The seats on the east side are too narrow. During the breakfast, no guests were found to sit there!

msg:When I checked into the Westin Hotel for the first time, I booked a room on Ctrip and followed the instructions on Ctrip to add money to upgrade the room type. When I arrived at the hotel and checked in at the front desk, their service was very blunt and said that the upgraded room type had nothing to do with their hotel. I contacted Ctrip and the room type I was given was very poor. The floor was very low and the windows were surrounded by dark roofs. In fact, it was just a place to sleep at night, but their service was really not worthy of the hotel. It was a very poor experience.

I stayed in a suite at the Hyatt Hotel the day before, and the front desk was arranged on the 27th floor. , the landscape is invincible.

msg:Advantages: good location, 10 minutes walk from the Bund
Disadvantages: outdated facilities, poor sanitation, old carpets, obvious stains in the bathroom, the room type is too strange. Living on the 5th floor, the room is difficult to find and there is no obvious guideline, you need to go through the restaurant. Checking in the lobby is noisy and noisy, like going to a vegetable market. There are only one or two receptionists at the front desk. In short, it is completely unworthy of the standard of an old five-star hotel. For buffet breakfast, children over 4 years old need to pay half price.

There is also a big headache from the smell, so I asked the waiter to come up and smell it the day before yesterday. I stayed with the mask and said there was no smell. You have to go downstairs to the front desk and ask for a room change before you change back to the room type you have set. Mengren, a good room type with a high price will give you the lowest price room type. The hotel is too unreal. Never live again
