The decoration is fashionable, and the open kitchen is equipped with cooking utensils, dishes, cups and other supplies, making it convenient for everyone to have a late night snack. Hygiene is good, but facility maintenance needs to be strengthened.
The front desk was very kind and allowed us to delay check-out until 3pm.
Overall a nice little travel experience.

There was no WI-FI when I got to the room, and the phone was broken, so I couldn't contact the hotel front desk. After searching for the phone number, I contacted the hotel and was told that it would be fine at 3 a.m., but it turned out that everything was still broken when I woke up the next day. I had some local Guangzhou specialties for breakfast. The shrimp dumpling wrappers were so dry that I couldn’t bite them. The thin seasoning made them bitter. The pineapple buns had no aroma at all. I really don’t recommend staying here...

The front desk service was also very poor. There was no service. There was a station. The concierge was only responsible for standing around. When we were staying at the hotel, he looked at us with so much luggage and didn't help us. He didn't even help us push the boxes. The same thing happened when we left the hotel. As a pregnant woman, I didn't help push the boxes. , I am still only responsible for standing, let alone helping to carry the box to the car. I watch you unable to lift the box and then stand indifferently. Fortunately, the taxi driver helped me carry the box. It was like this for more than 4,000 yuan a night. I am speechless about the service. This is the worst service in a hotel I have ever stayed in.

msg:I chose a hotel apar**ent because I like this kind of home-feeling hotel with a larger area during my recent business trips.
Compared to the W hotel, the apar**ent hotel is really disappointing, sorry for the W brand.
The front desk staff of the W Hotel was very enthusiastic. Because they didn't know where the apar**ent was, they took the initiative to take me to the opposite building.
I went in, and it was disappointing. The front desk was so small that it didn’t look like a 5-star hotel. The staff at the front desk almost left, and they almost couldn’t check in. The uniforms at the front desk are not as good as those of a 4-star hotel. Maybe the aesthetics are different. I feel deeply similar to W The hotel is not a level at all, more like a staff dormitory.
After checking in, the room number is very difficult to identify, it is in bold, and the location is low, so it is hard to find.
I don't even have basic tea bags, so I have to go downstairs and ask the front desk for them.
The refrigerator is empty, and for such an expensive house price, there are not even a few bottles of cold drinks and small snacks, so arrogant.
The sink is so small that I think this is a 5-star hotel? ?
The reception attitude of the front desk staff is cold, and I don't know if the apar**ent hotel has another training system, which is completely unrefined.
The layout of the room is quite good, the bed is very comfortable, the sofa is also very good, the carpet is clean, and it is very comfortable to walk barefoot.
The last piece of advice, as a local service, don't be so enthusiastic about foreigners, and do a good job of local service. If it doesn't work, you can learn from the W Hotel next door.

msg:Let’s talk about the advantages first. The location is very good. There are shopping malls and convenience stores within walking distance. It’s very convenient to go anywhere. The living room is large and the floor is high. The night view is very good through the floor-to-ceiling windows. It is more convenient for a family to live together with three bedrooms and one living room to take care of each other. The apar**ent price is slightly lower than booking three rooms at the W Hotel next door.

As for the shortcomings, I booked it after looking at the W sign. After checking in, I found that the facilities and services were still different from those of the hotel. The master bedroom bathroom always smelled like sewer, which was very unpleasant. The three bedrooms are all large bed rooms with only three quilts. We stayed in a five-bedroom apar**ent and did not exceed the number of guests. However, when we asked the front desk to add a quilt, we were told that we could only add one for free.

Complaints against the security guards for being arrogant, rude and threatening; the front desk lady failed to coordinate fairly and agreed to call the police, but she was just pretending to be full of slander, and the police did not expose her collusion with the male security guard until they arrived! I would like to reiterate here that one is to ask the platform to verify the situation with the hotel; the other is to ask the hotel to reply with a written email to inform the handling situation.
