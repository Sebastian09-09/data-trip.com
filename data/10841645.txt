Otherwise everyone was lovely and it’s a great hotel.  The Aranya village is a Great place to visit

Address: It is in the core area of ​​Phase 4, convenient to go anywhere
Hotel facilities: Overall, it is OK, the room is large enough, with a balcony; it is relatively quiet, and the sound insulation is relatively good; those with babies can ask the hotel to add a crib or a bed guard, and it is delivered very quickly. The toilet is not a smart toilet. The toiletries are still good.
The hotel has a free shuttle bus, just call it, and it is unobstructed in the community; the roselle tea on the first floor of the lobby is delicious.
Breakfast: With the shrimp steamed dumplings, there is no need to check in at the Internet celebrity store. The food is also quite rich, with everything you should have, and the taste is average.
The lawn outside the restaurant is very beautiful. Every time after breakfast, I will play outside for a while, and the experience is good.

The snacks and toiletries are in the usual style of Aranya, and they are of high quality. The playground at the entrance of the hotel is more popular with children. It feels like they can spend a whole day there even if there is nothing else. The only bad thing is that the hotel did not find a very convenient way to go directly to the underground garage. Going out from the F gate, the shortest way to the underground garage is at the entrance of the third canteen. Otherwise, you have to go in from the entrance and exit with the vehicle, which is not very safe. Others are very good. This location is not close to the beach, nor far away, and you can buy some supplies along the way. In short, it is just right.

msg:A very good hotel, a little unexpected.
The location is very good, in the community center, although not facing the sea, but not far from anywhere. There are children's entertainment areas at the main entrance and on the north side of the hotel, and they are relatively large in the community. In addition, there is a children's farm across the road on the east side, which is actually the core area for strolling. The children's area on the north side is next to the third canteen, and across a small road is a street of restaurants. One minute to the west is the cinema and bakery, and one minute to the north is the seaside market. Ten minutes to the south is the beach, and within 300 meters there are the first canteen, neighborhood center, life element supermarket, horse club, and several Internet celebrity restaurants.
The hotel shuttle can basically take you to any place in the community where the shuttle is allowed to go, and you can summon the hotel shuttle to pick you up to the next destination anywhere where the shuttle is allowed to go.
The hotel parking space is not very abundant, but it provides valet parking service, and you can also take an electric car to the basement.
The hotel is great in details, such as toilet paper, which is not the kind of cellophane used for hotels, but real commercial paper, the same as the ones you buy at home; the width, length, curvature, and hardness of the toothbrush handle, the hardness and softness of the bristles, and the fact that they do not shed hair at all, are also the same as the toothbrushes you buy at home.
The biggest surprise is that you can eat and drink as much as you want in the guest room. And it is not just two cans of small Coke to deal with you. Snacks are imported, and drinks include Evian Yuanqi Forest Wangzai milk soda, which are all kinds of more than ten kinds, and you can even take them away. These things are not worth much, but they actually give guests a very high psychological comfort.
Breakfast is until 11 o'clock, and the empty plate can be refilled immediately at 10:50, which is very friendly.
The food and drinks in the lobby bar are not expensive.
The staff are all handsome men and beautiful women, and they should have been deliberately selected.
Check-out is also free of room inspection.
If you come to Aranya again, Anlan Hotel will definitely be a plus.

We took a taxi to check in a little early, and we were worried that there would be no room, but we didn't expect the room to have been cleaned.
After that, a beautiful customer service lady took the initiative to help carry our bags and took us to our room. She gave us a gentle and detailed explanation of the use of hotel facilities. The hotel also gave us a lot of water and snacks. If there is not enough water, you can ask for more. Coffee can be made by yourself with a coffee machine, and the taste is mellow and rich.
It was a bit cold when I came back from the beach. There were also free red date hot tea and iced sour plum soup in the hotel lobby. Although the stay was short this time, I experienced happy, comfortable and thoughtful hotel services. I look forward to seeing you next time~🥰🥰🥰

msg:Friends have been recommending An Lan from Aranya
We are here on a cold winter day and it lives up to our recommendation.
Light fragrance in the hotel
Large leisure space in the lobby with lush and unique green plants
Just shoot it and it will be a blockbuster. I love it so much.
Free "Red Date Rock Sugar Tea" is heart-warming and sweet

I also like the style of the rooms in Anlan Hotel so much.
It's like entering a quiet Zen room from the noisy city
My heart slowly calms down
Warm wood color and lots of grille design
Black iron curtain rod Black burnt stone bar
Dark gray antique floor tiles and white window screens
Proper Nordic simple style
Floor heating at 23-25 ​​degrees is especially valuable in Aranya, which is cold in February.

Air conditioners, TVs, refrigerators, foot baths, and humidifiers are all available. There are plenty of bottled water, snacks and drinks in the room, which makes people feel a little satisfied.

All the staff greeted each other proactively, responded to all requests, and answered all questions. The young men in the lobby rushed to help carry the luggage. It was really a "rush", haha. I realized the hotel's intention to strive for high-quality services.

Anlan Hotel also performs well in terms of catering. The Chinese and Western buffet includes hot food, cold food, fruits, pastries, etc., which is pretty good.

All in all we had a very enjoyable 2 days at the Aranya Hotel. From the hotel's hardware facilities to software services, I felt its high quality and thoughtfulness.

In order to prove that it is not a delay, I would like to make two small suggestions: the waiting time for the shuttle bus is long, and it is extremely cold at the beach in February, so waiting for a few minutes is the limit.

Some of the girls at the front desk were bare-faced, some were wearing heavy makeup, some were tall, short, fat, or thin, which did not match the star rating of the hotel. (Maybe to reduce costs?


Mini bar drinks: I like it very much, it is really a special item

Finally, come to Aranya, live quietly at Anlan Hotel, and watch the sea quietly at Aranya Auditorium! Enjoy a few days of mental relaxation.

msg:Pure dry goods evaluation!!! The hotel is very large, and the decoration is also very much liked. 1️⃣The room has an independent balcony, 2️⃣The breakfast is very rich and great, 3️⃣The staff is also very warm and thoughtful. The guest manager Yang Lishan picked us up in the parking lot and added WeChat as soon as possible to answer all questions. The service is thoughtful! It makes us feel very warm when we first arrive~ Because we have booked different hotels in advance, we will move back if we stay one more day! Traveling with the baby, I took the initiative to add a crib and installed it. The bed is very comfortable and firm. The child will not sleep too soft, and the adult will sleep comfortably! As for hygiene, it is generally good. There is a little dust on the table. Because we stay consecutively, it may be a little difficult to clean up, but you can still pay more attention~

msg:The hotel is in a community. You need to register a vehicle to enter the community. The overall speed is OK. All classics in the community need to have a community identity after checking in. You must make a reservation in the Aranya app.
The hotel is relatively large, not far from the entrance of the park, and not far from the seaside auditorium.
The room is relatively large, with a water bar, living room and balcony. The overall equipment is well maintained and the cleanliness is acceptable. The water pressure is slightly lacking and the sound insulation is average. (There are always customers laughing and chatting in the corridor, regardless of the hotel.)

Facilities: No bathtub, no smart toilet seat

Service: Kuaibuy cannot go upstairs, the store staff will be responsible for delivery, which takes about 20 minutes
You can line up in the lobby to get on the bus when going to various attractions. You still have to wait, but it is generally convenient.
Breakfast: The restaurant is quite large, but the service is not up to par. Many of the tableware and meals are empty. There are not many choices, but they are enough.
During your stay, welcome snacks and drinks are provided on the first night. There is plenty of water for sure.
Breakfast was a bit of an episode. After ordering breakfast, the restaurant said it was not available and asked the guest to go to the front desk. In the end, the clerk went to the front desk together and found out that breakfast was available. The clerk apologized afterwards.
The environment is good, the hotel configuration is also good, but the front desk service is slightly lacking.
Overall acceptable.

msg:The Anlan Hotel was the right choice for the trip to Aranya. The hotel has a great location, complete facilities, and first-class service. The hotel shuttle bus can pick up guests to the destination or pick them up back to the hotel. Before coming, due to itinerary reasons, the originally booked four-person family room was planned to be changed to a double room. Because it was stated that it was non-refundable, I tried to communicate with the hotel and Ctrip platform and quickly solved it. I was very satisfied. After checking out, they also gave me a pack of morning tea ingredients. I hope to see you next time.

They took us to the room after check-in and added WeChat to communicate at any time. There was a shuttle bus to the auditorium to watch the sunrise starting at 5 am. When you see the Anlan shuttle bus in the park, you can wave and stop at any time. Just tell the place you want to go. If there is no shuttle bus, you can call the hotel to pick you up. It is very convenient.

To be honest, the price is a bit expensive during holidays, but I understand.

msg:All the waiters greeted with a smile, and good manners kept a good mood. The hotel designed corridors with different letters corresponding to different areas. I just want to say that Anlan is really large, and the corridors take a long time to walk! There are many highlights in the room service, which is worthy of the room price. Snacks, drinks, mineral water, slippers and toiletries are parent-child friendly sets. There are little prince embroidery on the children's slippers. There are heightened stools in the bathroom. The first-floor room is equipped with a super large terrace. Xiaomi TV can be on demand or cast at will. Everything is good, but I wonder if the customer service phone can't be reached at 8 or 9 o'clock in the evening. The way from the room to the front desk is quite far. At that time, the equipment failure was ruled out because several devices were changed. Later, the waiter gave feedback to help the next day before it was fixed. You have to queue up for breakfast, so it's better to go early during the off-peak hours!

First of all, the hotel staff is well-trained, and everyone they meet will greet the guests; secondly, they are responsive to requests, and the pillows can be changed and delivered immediately. If you like the snacks, you can ask the hotel to add more without any hesitation; the location is convenient, the shuttle bus service is good, the hotel breakfast variety is rich and the dining environment is good. If you order takeout, the hotel will arrange staff to pick it up at the entrance of the park and deliver it to the room. Although it is not the best and most expensive facility in the park, the service is really satisfactory.

The room was clean and hygienic, but the TV network signal was a bit poor and always stuck. There were also free snacks and drinks in the room, which were very generous.
Overall, this experience was very good and I will come again next time if I have the chance.

msg:It's the off-season for Aranya recently, and you can get hotel discounts on many platforms. After seeing An Lan several times, I finally couldn't help but take action. I took the high-speed train from Beijing to Aranya for a short break on the weekend.
Location transportation:
In the Aranya Park, it is not close to the sea, so to watch the sunrise, you need to take a shuttle bus to the beach. But also because there is a shuttle bus, it is very convenient to go anywhere in the park.
Even walking is not far.
Room facilities:
There is a balcony, a sofa, and a bar, which is relatively complete.
Snacks and drinks were also given. Although there is no bathtub, you can ask for a foot bath bucket, and disposable bags and foot bath bags will be provided. The room was very hot and dry, but there was a humidifier.
breakfast:
It’s quite plentiful, and there weren’t many people when I came back from watching the sunrise. Steamed prawn dumplings are provided for breakfast, so you don’t have to go out and line up at internet celebrity restaurants. The coffee and milk tea in the lobby bar also taste good.

This article is dedicated to this trip to Aranya
The most correct choice is "Anlan Hotel"
After checking in and experiencing it, I just want to say
How could there be such a thoughtful and sincere hotel?
The off-season travel in Aranya is really fun and comfortable.
Very relaxing and definitely won’t regret it
Aranya is really beautiful in winter
	
·hotel reservation
I made a reservation the night before check-in. There was no breakfast for two nights. It was in time for park activities and it was difficult to book a room. Especially everyone knows that An Lan has good service and is full of people!
After booking, the hotel will call to ask how to enter the community. If you drive by yourself, you can report your license plate number and enter the park smoothly without waiting.
·hotel service
I have to say that Anlan Hotel is simply not too considerate.
1. Those who arrive early can store their luggage first. If there is no room yet, it is no problem to check in after taking a walk. There is free red date tea in the lobby, which is incredibly delicious! It's cold outside. Come inside and have a cup of hot food to warm your stomach. It's so comfortable.
2. The people in the hotel are very welcoming and will respond to any questions. There are many handsome guys at the hotel concierge hhh (Zundu!) who are very enthusiastic and help with luggage and say hello politely...
3. The hotel's shuttle bus is so convenient. You can call a bus anywhere you go. We will call you when you arrive. When you checked in, you made a reservation to watch the sunrise the next day.
·Room facilities
This time I booked a double room. The room is large and warm (it has floor heating and air conditioning)
As soon as you enter the room, there is a relatively high-end fragrance. It is very comfortable and makes you feel good.
In addition to the snacks and drinks coffee and tea that everyone can see, the hotel has also thoughtfully prepared slippers of different sizes, mouthwash cups for a family of three, foot stools, and portable cups... It really makes people feel that they are very considerate. Very warm~
Anyway! It's really as good as everyone says online! It’s worth it, making your trip more comfortable and happy

The service staff found me ginger and brown sugar (a lot) and boiled water. I drank it and fell asleep😀.

The only drawback is that the Anlan Hall on the first floor was a bit cold during breakfast🥶.

The free snacks and drinks in the room are quite delicious. When the weather is cold in winter, free hot drinks like red date tea are provided on the first floor.
The toiletries also feel good to use.
Breakfast included, relatively rich.
2 splash pool experience coupons: It is far away from the hotel, but you can take the hotel's special shuttle bus. The water temperature is 29°C, not cold at all.
After playing for a while, Ms. Yang helped to renew the room in time, so that we would not have to rush back to pack our luggage.

Come to see the frozen sea of ​​​​oranges and watch the sunrise in the morning. The temperature at this time is very low and very cold. There is a shuttle bus to pick you up early in the morning and you will be warm! There is also warm red date tea in the lobby, which is super delicious! Highly recommended! There are also snacks and bottled water in the room.
The third canteen is right next to the hotel. It’s perfect to have a warm breakfast after watching the sunrise!
Wang Weiwei, the guest manager at the front office of Anlan Hotel, is attentive and meticulous in service and super enthusiastic. If there is any need, he will follow up and help solve it in time! The experience of staying at Anlan this time was great! Next time the weather gets warmer, bring the kids to play again!

Compared with the unsatisfactory little places the first time, this New Year's Eve trip was much more perfect ~ This time I was arranged to live in District D. I feel that the overall facilities and hygiene of the room are much cleaner than last time. The double bed is much more comfortable than the twin bed. The size of the single bed is a bit embarrassing. I recommend everyone to book a double bed room! The courtyard on the first floor is super big. If you come in spring and summer, you should be very comfortable in the courtyard😌
The hot red date tea in Anlan’s hall is a must-drink every time. I still miss it after I go back. I have to drink a cup whenever I pass by. Hahaha, it’s so happy to drink it in winter! There are no potato chips in the guest room snacks this time, but the donut snack is also delicious😋
Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to Manager Wang Weiwei for his considerate care☺️ I will stay here again if I have the opportunity, and I will also recommend it to my friends~

msg:It is 1.2KM walk from Aranya Church. The rooms are small apar**ent-style, reasonably designed, and the balcony is spacious enough. The desk and bar settings are very suitable for use, and the large sofa is also very comfortable for watching TV. The angle of the TV is indeed low and it is not very comfortable to watch, but it does not matter if we watch less TV.

The daily necessities are of good quality and can be used with confidence. We have prepared several snacks, coffee, and drinks which are great! We didn't eat or take away earplugs and drinks we didn't like. The hanging ear coffee is thoughtful and comes with a cup. It was really good to taste it the next morning.
There was plenty of mineral water for coffee and tea.

There is also ginger black tea they brew at the front desk, which Cantonese people say is “delicious”.
The recipe is provided, you can follow the recipe and cook it yourself at home. Every time we come back we have to have a drink or two before going upstairs.

To watch the sunrise, you need to reserve a battery car with the front desk 1-2 days in advance, otherwise you may not have a seat. Fortunately, it's not a very far walk, about 12 minutes. It's cold, so wear more clothes before going out.

Whether you are driving by car or taking a taxi, you must register your license plate number with the hotel in advance before you can enter the park. You are not allowed to enter the park if you do not stay in the park.

It was still great to see the abundant snacks and water as soon as I entered the door. The last time I came I felt that the soundproofing was not good, so I called to ask for earplugs. This time, they were thoughtfully placed on the island in advance. I would like to especially commend Ms. Liu Pengyan from the housekeeping depar**ent. Although we have never met her face to face, she carefully helps us clean the room every day. She also helps us replace the bag and medicine bag of the foot bath, and writes me a small card to remind us that it is cold. Adding more clothes when I go out makes me really feel at home! I carefully collected the little cards you wrote for me and took them home! The jujube tea at the front desk is still delicious. I took one cup out of the transparent plastic cup in the room. It warmed my hands and stomach. I only drank 5,678 cups during my three-day stay. Madam, it tasted so good. I took a photo. I took a look at the ingredient list and tried to see if I could reproduce it at home. The Korean rice cake snacks are delicious😋. Oh, by the way, this set meal includes breakfast. An Lan’s breakfast restaurant is too small. I went there at 8:30 in the morning. The wait for a table of 30 was a bit long, but fortunately the breakfast was delicious, especially Xiaomaisui's steamed dumplings with large fillings and a whole big shrimp 🍤 inside! The sauerkraut filling is also delicious. The only drawback is that you have to wait for a while when there are many people! All in all, I highly recommend this place if you are bringing a baby~

msg:Anlan Hotel, I really stayed here until I didn’t want to leave!

Although there were many people when I checked in, the staff in the lobby provided really good service, patiently answering questions and having clear logic. I saw an aunt in the lobby asking the lobby usher where to store her luggage. The usher girl directly picked up the aunt's backpack, put it on her back, and then took her to the storage area. It was really heartwarming.

It was my birthday this time. The hotel helped decorate the room and gave me a delicious cake. The staff was always responsive and had a very good attitude.

After checking in, there was water in the room (this was the first time I saw 10 bottles of mineral water placed in a hotel room), drinks and snacks for free. It really made people feel at home.

The bathroom is separated into dry and wet areas, and I would like to praise Aranya's cleaning and care products: Lokadhatu Zen and Wood Cleaning and Care Series, which I like very much and smells a bit like Aesop!

Special praise for Anlan's 24-hour shuttle bus. When you go out to play, you line up in front of the hotel and report the number of people and destination. When you return to the hotel, you need to call the front desk and the staff will arrange a car to pick you up. Every staff member is extremely friendly and welcoming.
There is a children's playground in front of the Anlan gate, with sandy areas, small trampolines, slides, etc., suitable for babies.

Anlan is in the center of the entire community, and the surrounding facilities are very complete. Behind it is the San Canteen, and a little further away is the Seaside Market (supermarket), Xiaomaisui, Acun Baking, Huamei, etc., and walking in the opposite direction is the fish market, a The cafeteria, opposite the hill where the first cafeteria is located, is hug, shakeshake, and the second cafeteria. There is Senhai (Japanese food) in the Guanhai Apar**ent where the second cafeteria is located. Opposite the shake shake is where the Yellow River enters the sea. If you want to walk, it only takes ten minutes to walk, or it will be faster to take the shuttle bus.

Good accommodation will add points to the trip. When I woke up in the morning, the sky was clear in Aranya. I opened the window and saw the blue sky and white clouds. I was healed. I thought: If I wake up in a room like this every day and see such a view, it will be wonderful. How nice it would be.

When you are tired from walking, you can ask for a foot bath and the service staff will be ready to bring it to you.
The shower gel and body lotion smell great. You can take a bottle of body lotion with you as hand cream when you go.
The red date tea in the lobby is delicious, and the hanging ear coffee provided in the room is also delicious.

Bad review:
I was going to give it 100 points, but in the end, I could only give it 60 points because of the shuttle bus problem on the last day.
Although the entire Aranya is not very big, the scenic spots are relatively loose. The hotel used to be some distance away. In addition, the winter is relatively cold now, so you need to take a shuttle bus from the hotel to the scenic spots, or between the scenic spots. The hotel provides a 24-hour shuttle bus. I don’t know how many buses will be arranged during the peak season, but now in the off-season, there are only 4 buses running in circulation every day. With the current occupancy rate, 4 cars are actually barely enough, and the waiting time is basically within 5-10 minutes, which is acceptable.
However, on December 1st, because there were group tourists staying, a shuttle bus was used for group use. One was sent for repair. There are only 2 shuttle buses running in rotation. I called for a taxi three times that day, and the waiting time each time was more than 20 minutes. The longest wait was 26 minutes. The temperature was 2 degrees. I stood on the beach and waited for 26 minutes with the sea breeze blowing. I was speechless to the extreme. I just wanted to go home. Got a fever.
If you know that there will be fewer shuttle buses due to team or maintenance reasons, you should prepare other shuttle buses in advance to ensure that there are at least 4 buses circulating for individual tourists every day. According to the minimum estimate, 100 people will need to use the shuttle bus. Two cars? Are you joking?
I have 100 complaints about the management of Anlan Hotel. Such a basic problem can actually happen. I don't give a bad review because the basic service staff provide good service.

msg:The hotel's evaluation can be described as "excellent"! It certainly lives up to its reputation!
The hotel is located in the center of the park. It is very convenient to travel. It is very close to the auditorium, the third canteen and the art center. It is also very convenient to park here by car.

The hotel room is spacious and fully equipped. The sofa in the room is very comfortable and there is a large terrace, which is very comfortable at noon.

The service is simply great, both the appearance and the enthusiasm and professionalism of the service are outstanding, and the house is filled with all kinds of personalized needs in every detail.

Breakfast was great! The food and service are very good. During peak hours, you need to take a number and wait for a table, so there are enough people inside, and the experience is very good.

When I came back to chat with my friend, he also said, "The most successful thing about a service company is to allow customers to have an experience in which they take advantage of themselves." Anlan Hotel has indeed done that ~ hahaha ~

Finally, I would like to add that it is very beautiful to experience the winter sea in the off-season~

msg:Only the location and breakfast are worthy of praise for this hotel.
1. As Aranya 1.0 version of a long-established hotel, the facilities really need to be considered to be upgraded. As soon as you enter the room, there is a strong smell of sewerage, which comes from the bar pool.
2. The staff service cannot keep up. It can be seen that the staff are working hard, but there are too many guests, the supply is unbalanced, and the service quality cannot keep up, let alone butler-style service.
3. The interior of the room is compact and there is no bathtub. It is more like an apar**ent. The area is 40-50 square meters, and half of it is allocated to the balcony.
4. There is construction on the left side of the lobby, and the noise and dust pollution fence cannot stop it at all.

When checking in, he will thoughtfully ask if you want to watch the sunrise in the morning and inform you of the bus time that can be reserved. After checking in, you can also see various thoughtful settings and reminders of the hotel. The sunrise time, climate temperature, cleaning time, water heater capacity, etc. are written in the room. After entering the room, I realized why I couldn't check in until 15:00 in the afternoon. Although the room facilities showed signs of use, they were all clean and tidy. Even the balcony facilities were wiped very clean. Finally, special thanks to Miss Liu Qian at the front desk for her warm and considerate service🥰

The Anlan Family Suites Hotel where Anaya was staying called me a day in advance to help me register the license plate. The room was also decorated. Even though it was off-season, I arrived at around 3pm and still had to queue for more than 20 minutes. There were quite a few people waiting to check in. I have to say that the service was really good and everyone’s service was super! Every service staff will take the initiative to say hello when meeting, take the initiative to ask if they want service, and take the initiative to help unload luggage from the car. I would like to thank Yajie very much. It is really super considerate! Everything is answered! They also gave me several baking coupons! People who come to Aranya for the first time recommend staying at Anlan! very convenient! Very close to everything! I was originally hesitating between Yinlu and Anlanli! It’s definitely your first time staying in Anlan!

msg:The long-awaited trip to Anaya left more beautiful memories because of my stay at Anlan. As soon as the car parked in front of the hotel, I felt at home. I handed the car key to the doorman and went straight to check in. The front desk gave us a canteen meal voucher, helped us reserve a battery car to watch the sunrise the next day, and drank hot jujube tea to the room. When I walked in, I saw all kinds of snacks that everyone had seen. The waiters on the floor were super enthusiastic and gave away snacks that my kids loved, which made me feel warm. There was a problem with the air conditioner in my parents' room, so the manager directly moved me to a suite upstairs. It turns out that the suites only have Dyson, coffee machines and purifiers 🥹There is a big octopus slide outside the hotel, which is also very convenient for eating. The battery car is very convenient to go everywhere. The brother who registers the battery car route will also give the children a lollipop!

There are snacks, drinks, and coffee, which is very comfortable. A three-minute walk downstairs from the hotel is the Third Canteen, which is really good value for money. Battery cars can take you where you want to go. I like Aranya and Anlan!

The service attitude is very good, basically everything is answered, and the lady at the front desk is so pretty~
Let’s talk about the areas that need improvement:
1. There was no hot water halfway through the shower. My sister finished the shower with cold water, and then she caught a cold.
2. The bedside socket was broken and was not checked and repaired in time. So I went to bed early that day because my phone was charging elsewhere and I couldn't lie down and play. (At first, I thought the data cable was broken, so I asked the staff for a new one, but it still didn’t work. I thought the data cable was broken, so I bought a new one from the takeout store, but in the end I found out that the socket was broken!! It’s a long time coming)
3. When you pick up your luggage in the lobby, you can see that there are paper bags available. It is recommended that you put one or two paper bags in each room. Sometimes you will need them when going out.
I'll add more if I think of anything else~

It’s more convenient. Why don’t you open your phone and look for it every time? Come back when you have time.

The first is cost-effectiveness: affordable! Only three digits! Stayed for three nights in a row! Free all-you-can-drink snacks and drinks at the minibar! Very rich!
Secondly, the room is comfortable and the service is full of details: the room is huge! There is a bar and a huge balcony! There is a clothes drying rack on the balcony! Meet the changing needs of long-term stay! The bed is huge and very comfortable! There is also floor heating in winter! awesome!
You can see the waiter's speech and weather forecast at the door! In addition, anti-collision *****s are installed in the room, which is very considerate! Suitable for parents and children!
In addition, there are scheduled buses in front of the hotel that deliver to all parts of the community! Very convenient!
Behind the hotel is the third canteen, which is very convenient for eating!

The only drawback is that the bath water is not strong! The hot water is boiled with an 80L water heater. After a while, there is no hot water and the adjustment is poor! It’s a design failure! I hope it can be improved next time I stay!

Yes, very considerate. In the park, there are all kinds of petty bourgeoisie sentiments, cool food for you to take pictures in a daze. The food in the cafeteria is relatively cheap, and if you want to eat well, there are many specialty restaurants. We ate at Tangxin Sichuan cuisine twice, and it was very good. The literary and artistic Aranya left me with wonderful memories and I will come again in the future. The hotel breakfast is delicious, especially the steamed shrimp dumplings with custard buns. The only drawback is that the hotel breakfast has not changed for three days, and it has not changed at all.

This is The Truman World with countless people’s memories superimposed together...
However, it is really worth coming to see him.
Anlan Hotel has the highest rating among all the hotels on the platform, so it is the first choice.
There is nothing to say about the environment. The entire hotel is surrounded by greenery, lawns, and various fruit trees. Just taking a walk in the hotel will make you feel relaxed and happy. It is also very close to San****ang and Xiaoyu Village, and it is very convenient to have meals nearby.
The hotel has a dedicated shuttle bus that will take you to every place you want to go. Room-temperature mineral water and hot red date tea are thoughtfully prepared at the door. The storage service is also very convenient. It doesn't matter if you arrive early or leave late. Affect your itinerary.
The room is fully equipped, from small headband clips for makeup to small stools that take into account the height of the child. There are also a lot of mineral water, drinks, and snacks, allowing you to have snack freedom! The most important thing is that his shampoo really doesn't smell too good. It's easy to use and tastes very high-end. These all give a very good impression.
The only drawback is that I don’t know if it’s because there are too many guests checking in. The staff is too busy and the response speed is really slow. When we checked in at 3 o’clock, we were told that a room had not been packed out and we had to wait for a few minutes. As a result, it was almost 4 o'clock and no staff came up with the room card. I had to rush twice before I got the room card.
Moreover, the Wi-Fi in the room usually disconnects in 2 minutes. No matter how many times it is connected, it will suddenly disconnect. Don't know why.
What’s more, there are actually 2 flies in the room that can’t fly away🫢🫢🫢
Other than that, everything is great. I hope it can improve. I will come to Anlan next time. 😍😍😍

There is a large balcony with a view. It is equipped with folding clothes drying racks, leisure tables and chairs, and you can exercise on the balcony in the morning (the kind that is not noisy😄). The hotel is very central, divided into areas A-G, and maybe H. It is super large, and it is very convenient to swipe cards in and out of each area. The third cafeteria is on the first floor of the hotel. The food in the cafeteria is quite delicious (the most affordable place to eat is probably the cafeteria)
The food and drinks in the snack bar in the room are free, and the snacks are of good quality and are replenished every day. People with children should like it very much, especially oversized babies. The best thing is the breakfast in the hotel. The large stuffed prawn steamed dumplings and the mushroom and pork steamed dumplings are simply not too fragrant👍 There are also many other breakfast foods. There are many people but not crowded. I have to praise the hotel's management system. All levels of management are orderly and the service is good. The staff are warm and considerate, and the front desk is responsive to all requests, which is most commendable! All in all, I want to come again and I will never forget the steamed dumplings😄

2. The room is clean and tidy, and the pillows are extremely comfortable! The balcony is very spacious. It is specially designed for a high floor. From the balcony, you can see the roof of the auditorium and the sea in the distance. It is very comfortable!
3. Anlan Hotel is particularly friendly to children. There are step stools, children's slippers and children's toothbrushes thoughtfully prepared in the room, which is great!
4. You can enjoy free snacks and drinks in the room. Note that free is not of poor quality to fool people. The snacks and drinks provided by Anlan Hotel are all high-end. There is a bottle of coconut water and shrimp chips, but the prices are not high. Fei, I saw it in the seaside market, it was very expensive (I was just eating and drinking and forgot to take pictures)
5. Anlan Hotel has a dedicated shuttle bus that can take you wherever you want to go, and can also pick you up from anywhere. It is very convenient!
6. There are many restaurants and canteens around the hotel, which is very convenient for eating.
7. The red date tea in the lobby of Anlan Hotel is really delicious. Every time I go out and come back, I drink a cup of it. It warms my heart! However, on the day I left the store, because I was in a hurry to catch the bus, I didn’t bother to grab the last drink. It was such a pity that I still thought about it after I came back. It would be so beautiful if I could have a drink at home!
Well, a person who has never commented has written so much, which shows how satisfied he is with this hotel!

msg:I have heard the name of Anlan Hotel for a long time, and I finally stayed in Anlan Hotel. I can’t say it’s bad, but the accommodation experience is not as good as the accommodation price. Let’s talk about the advantages first. Firstly, Anlan Hotel is in the center of Aranya Park, so it is more convenient to go everywhere. Secondly, the sour plum soup in the lobby of Anlan Hotel tastes very good. It is made by the hotel itself and has no fragrance. Thirdly, the drinking water is very good. Convenient, there are a lot of bottled water in the room. If you forget to bring it when you go out or you are very thirsty when you come back, there are free bottled water in many places in the lobby. Let’s talk about the shortcomings. The cleaning is not that good. For such a high price, the details of the room are not well handled. There are no bathing slippers, no multi-purpose charging cable, and the swimming pool area downstairs is too small. The management of Aranya Park is still very good, whether it is travel or dining experience, it is very good.

Although there are not as many shuttle buses as Hermitage, the service is really good
Miss Ma, the service staff in area f, has helped us a lot, thank you very much
An Lan is far from the beach, but the third canteen is 15 meters away from the first floor. It is convenient to eat and drink, and the cinema is also close. Everyone in the lobby is enthusiastic

The only thing that’s not good is the swimming pool. It’s too troublesome to say, but it’s not good anyway. The main reason is that the service staff with short hair is not good. I’ve already written a letter to Ma Yin’s mailbox, so that’s the thing, annoying**

Especially Sister Xue Shuan, who works in the sanitation depar**ent on the fifth floor, is very serious, careful, responsive to requests, very considerate and polite. All the staff will greet the guests sincerely and smile when they meet.
The two supervisors, Wang Ya and Wang Weiwei, are beautiful and very good at dealing with stress problems. We were immediately moved by their eloquent apology and sincere service, which made us feel bad when we first arrived. My mood immediately improved. Their service is really excellent!
The breakfast is very rich and solid. Everything that should be there is there. The steamed dumplings with mushrooms and diced meat are really delicious, fresh and unique.
Tofu curd and rice porridge are both delicious. Prawns were even served for breakfast. There are many types of desserts, which are quite tasty and not greasy.
The room was cleaned every day and the toiletries were very useful.
Although Shadian is not a five-star hotel and is a bit old, the software is very good, better than a five-star hotel and very user-friendly.
During the hot season, the drinks in the small refrigerator are free of charge, and you can drink whatever you want from the snacks and bottled water on the mini bar in the room. Especially the imported potato chips are super delicious. There is also free red date tea and sour plum soup in the lobby.
There are two outdoor swimming pools in Shadian, one for children and one for swimming. It's a pity that there is no indoor heated swimming pool.
The greening is very good, and everything is green. Due to the good location, it is convenient to go anywhere. Next to San Canteen, the food in San Canteen is cheap, delicious and clean!
Staying at Anlan Hotel in Aranya is my first choice.

The shuttle bus runs every three minutes, but the swimming pool is a bit small.

Snacks and drinks are replenished every day, like donuts and corn chips. I feel that the location of Anlan is very good. It is very close to various small shops and the third canteen. It is very convenient to eat and hang out. It is not far from the seaside. Although the hotel has a shuttle bus, we all like to walk to the seaside and the environment on the road Also very nice for walking. By the way, I forgot to try the red date tea in the lobby. It is said to be very delicious. I will give it a try next time.

msg:Aranya is so popular now. We came to see the Xiami Music Festival. We saw that the rooms in the park were already full a month ago, so we had no choice but to book an apar**ent outside the park that was closest to the music festival.
As the travel time approached, I thought about picking up the leak, but unexpectedly, I really picked it up. I actually booked An Lan, what a blessing!
I told a friend who had been to Anaya before that I would stay in Anlan this time. She told me to be mentally prepared. She said that the service could not keep up when there were many people and the room was not particularly clean. I also made a guide before coming and I really know how to read it. to some problems. But considering the convenience of the hotel, let's experience it.
As a result, from the first day of check-in, I experienced what it means to be immersive: feel at home!
Remind us which door to take a taxi from, and report the license plate number in advance to enter the park.
I am adhering to the principle of spending money in this province, traveling green, got out of the car and walked for about 30 minutes (just as aerobic
On the way, the hotel called and reminded me again which door to go to. I said I was walking and told me to pay attention to sun protection.
When I arrived at the hotel, there was no queue at all for check in, and then Ms. Caitong appeared. The first sentence was: It’s been a hard journey all the way. Hahaha I'm so flattered.
Then guide me to my room, and after a pass of concern, tell me that you have worked hard all the way, and send me a drink later. My mom, what kind of divine trea**ent is this! After a while, the lemon tea came, it was delicious and quenched my thirst!
The friend who was traveling with me happened to have a birthday on the 27th. The hotel prepared a handwritten greeting card and a birthday cake. I was really touched!
For these three days and two nights, I am really grateful to Cai Tong, who cared about whether we had a good rest and a good stay every day. The hotel shuttle bus is really convenient, with 24-hour stand by, you don’t have to worry about going anywhere in the park.
When I come back in the future, I will definitely recommend Anlan to all my friends! ! !

It only takes 5 or 6 minutes to walk to the White Church, Xiao Maisui, Chengji Tangshui, and Acun Baking from the hotel. The free snacks and drinks provided by the hotel are also very good . It would be even better if the hotel sends a souvenir before leaving. The L’Occitane and other souvenirs given by the other two star hotels in Beidaihe are even better~

Let me especially talk about the service attitude of this hotel. The summer vacation is almost full every day, and there are too many guests, but the staff is not impatient due to work fatigue. Every employee serves with a smile and is very considerate. The housewife and aunt are also very nice to see in the corridor. The guests will take the initiative to say hello, and the staff who received me, Wang Weiyi, is gentle and beautiful, actively helping me solve and deal with the problem, very satisfied.
In short, this is a very cost-effective hotel, and I will go there next time I have a chance.

After watching "Frozen Sea" and feeding the seagulls, I was also deeply impressed by An Lan. This trip with friends, I chose to stay at Anlan again after weighing the price/performance ratio. The service quality is still online, and the check-in and check-out procedures are fast. Because I checked in after 4 pm, I also gave a 50 yuan canteen meal coupon as a gift. Although An Lan is not close to the sea, there is a special shuttle bus in the park. Just wait in line at the hotel entrance, or transfer to the park bus to go to your favorite place. The hotel is very close to the No.1/Two/Third canteens, so dining is very convenient. In front of the lobby is a large lawn and children's play area. When the weather is hot, sour plum soup and paper cups (jujube tea in winter) are prepared at the entrance of the hotel and in the lobby for guests to enjoy at any time. There are potato chips, wafer biscuits, dried fruit and other snacks in the room, as well as drinks are free, and the supply of mineral water is sufficient. Although the room is not big, the area is divided reasonably. There are writing desks, sofas, refrigerators, bar counters, etc. The layout is like a large bay. I especially like the big balcony, where I can sit, drink tea, chat and watch the scenery, and the racks for drying clothes are also very user-friendly. If it is on the first floor, there is a huge platform yard. Although the bed is not big, the bedding is clean, tidy and comfortable. The bathroom supplies are complete, and the skin care lotion is brand new and unopened. There is also an umbrella in the closet which is very considerate. There are wet wipes and disinfectant on the bar counter, and there are warm cards reminding the temperature, sunrise and sunset times, and the details that can be seen everywhere. The friendly and enthusiastic service staff I met in the corridor is also the reason why I choose Anlan again. Details touch people's hearts, and details can determine success or failure.

In addition, the door of the toilet has to be pushed hard, and the sink is very narrow, and it is almost impossible to put anything other than a toothbrush cup. There is no place to put the change of clothes in the shower, which is also a bit troublesome. Also, the TV is facing the sofa, so you can't watch TV while lying on the bed.
There is a sink at the door, and drinks and snacks are replenished every day, which is great.

The only downside is that the breakfast room is a bit small, and you need to queue for a long time for breakfast, but the meal is very good. It is very close to the community cafeteria, and it is very convenient to check in at the attractions.

Special thanks here The housekeeper, Shuai Jiaxuan, is beautiful and kind-hearted, and the service is in place. The hotel provides a special car for free to take you around Aranya. If you are tired from walking, you can call to pick you up at any time. The breakfast is rich in variety and tastes good. The only regret this time is that there is not enough time, and it rained for two days

Drinks, snacks, and fruits in the room are all free, and you can add more if you don’t have enough, just love it. The breakfast is very delicious 😋, but there are a lot of people on weekends and need to queue up. The room is very large, 58 square meters, with a big sofa, divided into living room, kitchen, bedroom, bathroom and other functional areas, and also has a balcony with a drying rack, which is really suitable for living by the sea. The toiletries in the bathroom are very complete, even hair clips for girls, and noise-proof earplugs. The hotel's special shuttle bus can beckoned to park anywhere, making it convenient to go anywhere.

msg:Anaya is indeed very suitable for vacation and relaxation. It is very safe and convenient. Choosing Anlan Hotel is the most brilliant of this summer trip. My family all commented that the service is really good and the mineral water is free. For people who like to soak Tea and coffee are very family-friendly, so you don’t have to go to the supermarket to carry them yourself.
The only thing about this type of room is that the bathroom is a little small, and the sink is not enough to put things in, but you can put them on the partition table opposite the bed. The sofa in the room is super big, more than enough to sleep an adult, and it is very comfortable to spread out when you come back from the sea. The room on the first floor I gave you last time has a yard, but unfortunately I didn’t bring a yoga mat, otherwise a yoga class amidst the singing of birds in the morning would be great.
Transportation: The hotel's self-provided shuttle bus will take you anywhere, to every place that guests think of.
Front desk: The check-in was very kind, and many precautions were explained very clearly. Every time I asked some questions, I answered them patiently with a smile.
The whole community is also very convenient to eat.
The whole family decided to come to Anaya at a different time next time, stay at Anlan Hotel, and change to a high-floor room type to experience it.

Advantage 1: The transportation is convenient, and it takes only 7-8 minutes to walk to the beach after leaving the hotel; Advantage 2: Surrounded by delicious food, restaurants and small shops around are all "life elements"; the third canteen and fish market are most recommended, just 200 meters away from Anlan Hotel. Advantage 3: Good service attitude, all the staff are super helpful, warm and polite! In particular, I would like to give a thumbs up to Ms. Wu Xiaotian, guest manager of Anlan Hotel. This is the first time I came to Aranya. Ms. gave us a lot of suggestions and travel guides, and added a ticket to the Dune Art Museum, which is very considerate! I will definitely continue to choose Anlan next time!

The staff took the initiative to guide them to the door of the room and helped carry the heavy luggage. This move was really touching. It used to be I have never had such thoughtfulness in every hotel I stayed in, thank you. When we first came to Aranya, An Lan gave us the first good impression, very happy! Although the room is not big, it is very clean. Snacks and drinks are also prepared. The children are also very happy😊. Let me talk about the breakfast in particular. It is not very rich, but the taste is great. I would like to make a small suggestion. It would be more perfect if the shrimp line can be removed before cooking😊. I will come to Aranya again next time, and I must live in Anlan, which gave us a different experience

Although the location is not near the sea, it is totally acceptable if you don't pursue a sea view room. First of all, it is cost-effective, and the price is really suitable! The price is very favorable even in peak season~
The service is also super warm and thoughtful. From the phone confirmation one day in advance to the moment we get off the bus at the hotel, there will always be staff to entertain us, especially Ms. Zhao Guyue. She received us from check-in. The cub was very considerate and sent us back to the room, telling us where is suitable for children to play, which completely saves the time of doing strategy, and specially wrote down the name tag on her chest, and is going to write a big praise~
The environment and facilities of the hotel are also very new, and the cleaning is also neat and tidy. I like this simple room type. There will be no dead ends in hygiene. It makes people live comfortably. The room is also large and spacious, suitable for children
And the hotel really shouldn't be too considerate!
The room has endless drinking water, a mini bar, coffee, tea, sparkling water, drinks, potato chips, biscuits and snacks.
The cleaning series is also very useful.
There are even sand toys for children~
It is said that the hotel has just had breakfast, and the restaurant is not big. Although the sparrow is small and complete, the taste is also delicious. There are not many semi-finished products that make up the number.
The hotel's own swimming pool is not big, there is a shallow water area and a deep water area. Children can play in the water, and the water quality is relatively clean~
The location of the hotel is relatively close to the seaside market in the town, and the hotel shuttle bus is really convenient! Don't squeeze the cars in the park! If you go back to the hotel, you can call a car very quickly~
In short, it's the first time to live in Anlan, and it won't be the last time. I really think it's very cost-effective! Very happy hotel~
An Lan is so nice, I will come again in the future~

Location: The hotel is in the community center, it is more convenient to go everywhere, it is a bit far from the sea, it is best to take a shuttle bus. There is a children's playground and a swimming pool at the door, which were not open when I went. Choose according to your needs.

Self-driving: report the license plate number in advance, and the entry and exit are smooth, because it is in time for the theater festival, and the car cannot be opened after parking. Try to park on the ground, the underground garage is not very convenient, there is no elevator, if you have a lot of luggage, it is recommended to call the hotel to pick it up.

Check-in: You can only check in after 3:00 pm. We arrived in the morning. After storing our luggage, we can go shopping first. At this time, we can already take the hotel shuttle bus. Check-in after 4 o'clock will give you a 50 yuan canteen voucher. The lady at the front desk has a very good attitude, and the benefits that hotel guests can enjoy are very detailed.

Shuttle bus: very convenient, the park is not small, if the time to go is short, the legs will be very tired, the community shuttle bus needs to wait, there are still many people, and you have to see the ABC line clearly, hotel guests need to call at any time to make a hotel reservation car, or stop the car at any time when you see it on the road, saving energy and time. There is also a car at sunrise in the morning! Its shuttle bus is the most seen on the road.

Room: The sanitation is very good, and the anniversary is simply arranged. In addition to the conventional configuration, the room also has a refrigerator, children's slippers, and a balcony. The water and snacks in the room can be delivered to the room at any time if necessary, and the bottled water in the hotel can also be taken, which is very convenient in summer.

We chose a room with breakfast and lunch, which is very cost-effective, tastes good, and there is no queue. The breakfast is in an Italian winery, very close to the hotel. It is a buffet style. It seems that there are not so many varieties, but everything you want is included, and the taste is very good. The five seasons that are selected for lunch are enough for two people.

Overall: a very good hotel experience, very comfortable and convenient. If you have any questions, please call ahead.

The price-performance ratio is super high, the shuttle bus is very convenient to go anywhere, the staff is professional and enthusiastic, and the housekeeping sisters all show super high service spirit.

The package I ordered this time is incredible! ! ! ! !

Niner's and bacco also made two meals,
Ice cream is also given away, and Utopia coffee is also given away,
My God, if you send me two more beers,
I'm running out of money to spend on the island. whee.


Hygiene: Needless to say, full marks.

Environment: Needless to say, full marks.

Service: Needless to say, full marks, I would like to praise the housekeeping sister, she smiled brightly at me and put me in a good mood! I'm afraid that I don't drink enough water, so I always ask me if a bottle of water is enough, and I'll bring you another bottle. I drank ten bottles of water in two days, I am really the essence of the reservoir! Such a cute big sister.

The main reason why I like An Lan is that my best friend brought me here the first time I came here. That experience left a good impression on me, so when I came again, I chose this place without hesitation. And also Amway to many people.
That's how I am, I want to lay my head on Amway.

BTW, I quite like the utopia hanging ear coffee that was given away. It seems that I will come to Anlan again.

The curtains are opened and the eyes are full of green. The cool sea breeze blows makes people feel refreshed; special praise to Ms. Chen Ying, the waiter who cleaned the room for us, prepared the sunrise and sunset schedule for us in advance, and the potato chips were eaten by my wife. After eating, I was still reluctant to part, and the next day I had the cheek to ask not only to be fed but also to be given a drink, which was really heart-warming; Anaya is not a scenery that only comes once, and next time I will spend a few more days in Anlan!

Call the front desk and you can pick it up to your desired destination. The service staff will greet the guests politely when they see the guests, and the house is very clean!

Hygiene: The room is clean and tidy, without peculiar smell. It can be seen that the cleaning is in place and the room service is attentive.
Environment: The environment of the entire hotel is very good, surrounded by a children's playground. Looking from the balcony, the garden green space is patchwork, and the modern buildings are very eye-catching.
Service: From the lobby to the room service is thoughtful, the staff are courteous, responsive, patient and meticulous. In particular, the hotel provides a 24-hour car-calling service in the park. No matter where you are going or returning from anywhere, you can call a car to pick you up, which is so considerate. In addition, Anlan should be the only hotel with free bottled water, which can be provided unlimitedly. However, I would like to remind the hotel guests to take it on demand, not to waste, and to protect the environment.
Will come again and choose An Lan. I only stayed for two nights this time, and I still have more to say. Thank you Anlan Hotel!

The hotel staff are very polite and will take the initiative to say hello. When children are crying, they will give the car toys. If there are no snacks and water, they can be refilled for free. You can also take the hotel’s free car when traveling in the community. I don’t think it is convenient to drive by yourself, because the hotel is called There are many people in the car, the waiting time is sometimes longer, and there are many things to take with the children.
The child's pants were left in the hotel, and he also contacted me to help with the delivery.

Although I brought my parents with something in their hands, the concierge brother would take the initiative to ask if he needed help. The hotel has a special area for storing guests' luggage. I may understand that everyone will play for a while after checking out. The scent of the hotel is very high class. What I want to say is that the supplies in the room are very useful and very environmentally friendly. Even the food delivery will be delivered to your room by the concierge brother. Tell me Anlan, is there any service you don't provide? I will go again. It's a very cost-effective hotel. I'll stay in Anlan for two days if I want to make a mess in the future.
If I have to find a shortcoming, it may be that the TV series cannot be transferred haha. Maybe it is because I want me to sleep well.
There is also a safe in the room, and the lamp on the desk should not be too fragrant to sleep at night.

There is unlimited mineral water in the room, as well as delicious snacks. Although it is a little far from the sea, Anaya itself is not big, and it only takes ten minutes to walk there.
Besides, there is also a shuttle bus, you can make an appoin**ent to watch the sunrise, or you can go to any location in the park, just wait a few minutes.
The next time I go to Aranya, I will stay in Anlan for a few more days. (o^^o)

There are small snacks and potato chips in the room that are delicious 😋 Like it 👍! In addition, the third canteen is also a major feature. I went to have lunch every day for three days during my stay. This is the first time I stayed in a hotel for dinner. The environment is very good, there are many people but there are also many places... All in all, it is very good and worth recommending.

When there are many people in the hotel shuttle bus, you need to wait, but the number of buses is not small. Each room is equipped with a large terrace, and there is an extended platform on the first floor, which is very bright.
The jujube tea at the front desk is so nice, it is always hot every time I pass by! Watching the sunrise in the morning and coming back halfway is heartwarming. Hot and sweet.
The room also thoughtfully wrote down the time of sunrise and sunset! Mineral water pipes are enough! Snacks are free! It's too close to the third canteen. There are many choices for eating and drinking coffee next to it.
The small detail is that the hygiene of the guest rooms needs to be improved.

msg:The best way to visit Aranya is to stay in Aranya, and the most cost-effective hotel in Aranya is Anlan. Staying in the off-season only costs more than 600 a night, and you will get two restaurant coupons, which can solve two meals, and the price/performance ratio is unbeatable.

There are many hotels in Aranya, and many of the hotels near the sea have too small room types, which I personally don't like. Originally, the first choice was the Mediterranean Hotel. The rooms are large and close to the sea. There was no one answering the phone at the front desk for three consecutive days. I dare not stay in such a hotel. I can’t get in touch with anything when I live in it. Finally, I’m glad I chose it An Lan, after two days of experience, I really think it is very good, and I will choose it next time.

First of all, the service of the hotel is very good, and you can call at any time. Although it is not close to the sea, the shuttle bus can take you to the seaside, auditorium and other places, and travel is also convenient. Take a taxi from Beidaihe Railway Station and directly call the front desk of the hotel to report the license plate number and then you can drive into Aranya. The room type is relatively large, with more than 50 square meters of luggage spread out, and there is a large balcony. It should be quite comfortable to sit outside in summer.

Except that there is no bathtub in the room, everything else is available. Children's slippers and children's toothbrush are prepared for children in each room. Put 10 bottles of mineral water directly, and there are a lot of free snacks, which will be replenished the next day. The sofa is oversized and has many cushions, making it very comfortable to lie down and watch TV. There is air conditioning and floor heating in the room, and the temperature is suitable and not cold at all. The bed is big and soft, the bath water comes out quickly, and it is invincible and quiet at night. In short, it is really comfortable to live.

The location of the hotel is also invincible. Next to it is the third canteen, the most delicious canteen in Anaya. It is also convenient to watch movies. It is within walking distance. There is also a seaside market nearby, where you can buy some food and daily necessities. The hotel is also a very suitable hotel for bringing children. There is a children's manor, which is suitable for parent-child activities for families with children.

Finally, I would like to say that Aranya is really recommended to stay for two days. One day is really not enough. There are many places too late to play. The hotel business is good. If you arrive at 2:30 in the afternoon, you still have to queue up. If you check in at 17:00 in the evening, you will get free For movie tickets or breakfast, everyone needs to arrange a time in advance.

The hotel has a free shuttle bus, which can take guests to places they want to go in the community. The bus runs every few minutes, and there are buses 24 hours a day on weekends. It takes five minutes by car to go to the Aranya Auditorium and the library, and it is only a ten-minute walk away.
The hotel room area is relatively spacious, more than 50 square meters, and the functions of the inside and outside are separated so that rest and entertainment do not conflict. The bed is very comfortable, with just the right amount of firmness, making you feel at home.
The hotel's sanitation is thorough, and the toiletries are complete, especially for disposable slippers that will slip after being soaked in water. It is very thoughtful and thoughtful, which is countless times stronger than the parent-child hotel I stayed in a few days ago.

msg:3.18-19 one night stay
1. For the first check-in, report the car number in advance. When you arrive at the place, the identification fails and you call again to indicate that you need to report again. After 2 minutes, the identification is successful. The arrival time is about 2:20. Check-in is temporarily not available, and you have to store your luggage and go for a stroll
2. I requested in advance to combine the bed and a quiet room on the high floor. The hotel called me and told me that it would take time to check in later to combine the bed for me, because they would send me fruit for the license plate issue, and it was estimated that I would not be able to check in until 3:30.
3.3:20 I went back to the front desk of the hotel and queued up for check-in procedures (the room was full that day and there were a lot of people). The girl Li Dan who received me at the front desk was very kind. When she learned that I had been waiting for a long time, she specially adjusted the room on the third floor to ask me Is it possible, I said that I can check in first and then join the bed. After more than 20 minutes of processing and communication, I finally checked in. I asked for late checkout (I was given a ticket to the Art Center.
4. After I checked in, I called again and asked for a foot bath bucket (2 free foot bath medicine packs). I sat and rested on the sofa, and my aunt was in the bed. The big balcony has a good view, and I can see the sunset. The room is very Clean, water, beverages, tea bags, hanging coffee, and snacks are all free. Slippers are very comfortable. One bathrobe is dirty and the other is torn. I don’t know whether it has been opened for a long time or has not been replaced. I hope to receive a reply (Dandan notified me during the game that I can checkout until 2 o'clock)
5. The room is comfortable. There are many choices of pillows. I stayed for one night and didn’t experience different pillows.
6. It is not far from the auditorium, and it is very convenient to have a shuttle bus. If you want to go back to the hotel after going out, call in advance to call for a taxi, and the pick-up is usually very fast. The coffee in the lobby bar of the hotel is also good.
7. Going out of the E area is the third canteen. There are many delicious choices. I eat here all the time. Then I walk two steps to the market to buy strawberries. It is 100 times more delicious than the strawberries bought in Beijing.
As a senior hotel worker, I feel the high-quality service of my peers. The whole experience is excellent. The tiredness of the journey has been healed. I hope that the bathrobe/guest supplies will be more careful. After all, "one customer, one change" is mandatory. I commend the previous one again. Li Dan, a very good, professional and beautiful hotel person, should be reused and rewarded by the hotel.

I arrived at the hotel after four o'clock, and I also sent two photos of the art gallery, which are very in place!

msg:Anlan Hotel is very big. Area A and Area B are very close to the service desk. We live in Area C, which is far away. The room is large, and the TV wall divides it into two areas. The bathroom supplies are very good. There are also snacks and plenty of purified water. The hotel's sightseeing car is very frequent to pick up and drop off guests in various places, and it will pick up guests there in a few minutes after calling outside. We went there by high-speed rail. We took a taxi from the train station to Anlan Hotel at about 60. We need to report the car number to the hotel, and the pole will be lifted automatically when we enter the community. If there is a disadvantage, the WIFI speed in the room is a bit slow. The service staff of the hotel will take the initiative to say hello softly when they see the guests, which feels great. The joy restaurant in the package is also very good.

msg:Do a guide on Xiaohongshu, every Internet celebrity recommends Anlan Hotel, I don’t know why, then I will try to stay for one night
To be honest, this is not the type of hotel I like. Apart from good service, the hardware of other accommodations is really not good! The TV is so close to the sofa, and the TV is so big, I almost went blind, and I couldn't lie on the bed and watch TV
The most dissatisfied is the hot water for bathing, which is super unstable, sometimes hot and cold
The better place is the props for Internet celebrities to take pictures. An Lan can provide them, such as Aranya's water, paper bags, etc.
There are also many hotel shuttle buses, and I am willing to take them anywhere
The hotel has no meals at all, but the third canteen is at the back door of the hotel, which is also very convenient
An Lan is in a small town and cannot see the sea. To watch the sunrise, you have to take a shuttle bus to the seaside. Relatively speaking, it is not as convenient as a hotel near the seaside.

There are five choices of pillows, which is so sweet.
Mineral water, snacks and drinks are free, if not enough, you can call for refills

The sixth canteen is near the G area and within walking distance!

I thought that there were few people in a cold place, but I was wrong. It was hard to find a parking lot. Later, I found out that there is an underground parking lot. Aranya is such a big community, surrounded by hotels and apartments, there are a lot of places to eat, and there are a lot of people. 70% of the cars are from Beijing. I booked the Anlan Hotel on New Year’s Day. The hotel is really good. There is a living room, a bar, and a huge balcony. There are a lot of snacks and water, so you can eat whatever you want. The bedroom and the living room are separated by gauze curtains. There is a coffee shop in the lobby. It is 1 km away from the Aranya Church. It is just a stroll away. The overall feeling is very good. The hotel does not have a cafeteria. There are several cafeterias and restaurants around. It's a different feeling to see the sea in winter.

People like it, but Anlan Hotel is the best choice to come to Aranya. The service staff are enthusiastic, warm and polite. Sun Honglei from the shuttle bus is highly praised. He helped me solve many travel problems. Thank you, this place is not far from the beach Far away, it is also close to the cinema, the third canteen and the market. The hotel is also a**ospheric. Drinks and snacks are unlimited. We will try our best to meet the requirements. It is a very good hotel. I will come again. By the way, thank you for the birthday gift from the hotel Cake, I'm so touched, I will definitely come again, I haven't been out for three years, I am very satisfied when I come to Anlan for my first trip, and the staff of Ctrip are also very responsible, and they all give five-star praise!

Environment: There is a terrace in the room, and the view is a garden view. During the day, there is plenty of sunshine, so it's nice to sit on the terrace and bask in the sun.
Service: There are many bottles of mineral water in the hotel, which is the most mineral water I have given during my stay, and you can go to the lobby to get it unlimitedly.
Disadvantages: The hotel does not have a direct underground parking lot. The hotel's underground parking lot and the owner's apar**ent underground parking lot are shared, so in winter, you need to walk a short distance outdoors to enter the parking lot and drive.

An Lan heard all kinds of compliments before coming here, and after checking in, she really felt the comfort and convenience brought by all the details. Except for the slow check-in due to the large number of people, the others are basically impeccable. It is also the most generous hotel among all kinds of hotels.

Anlan made an appoin**ent many days in advance and bought a package with meals. There were many friends who checked in at the front desk that day, and the service attitude was very good. I informed the hotel and the park requirements in advance. The hotel service is very good, and the room provides small food and Drinks and milk are also provided free of charge, and even mineral water is very generous. The room is comfortable and the temperature is also suitable. It is about ten minutes walk from the beach. It is recommended to drive by yourself or take the shuttle bus provided by the hotel to the lonely library and church. There are many restaurants in the surrounding area. The restaurants provided by the hotel are not recommended for the restaurant I have been to. (Xiyue Jelly Tea (Aranya)/Aranya Fish Market (Theatre)), also a la carte The other dishes are not cost-effective, but the rest are good overall!

There is unlimited supply of drinks and snacks in the room , the little friend is so happy, the welcome letter written by the room staff and the weather, temperature, sunrise and sunset time of the next day are really considerate. Downstairs is the third canteen. The price is very reasonable. It takes 10 minutes to walk to the beach. There is a shuttle bus at the entrance of the lobby. It is very convenient to go every few minutes. Anyway, I will choose to stay again.

There are also basketball courts, slides, and outdoor swimming pools. There are parking spaces on the parking lot and underground, and the tram is also very convenient to charge. All in all, an absolute high score.

msg:This evaluation is entirely because of the guest relations manager of Anlan Hotel, Ms. Yaya. I seldom comment. I have stayed in various high-end hotels, and the service is also very good, but this Ms. really thinks of you. Solving all your problems, the key is to have a friendly attitude and make you feel comfortable and warm from the bottom of your heart. This is so rare, so I came here to evaluate. We waited for some time due to the problem of the room when we settled in and went through the formalities. At that time, the young lady happened to be in the lobby. We wanted to solve it as soon as possible and found her. She helped us deal with the room problem immediately and knew that we had children with us. He also gave us meal coupons and movie tickets, took us to the room to confirm, talked about some local issues, and immediately turned on the mobile phone to help us inquire. Who can refuse such considerate service? Some of the problems encountered before have disappeared in smoke. If I have the opportunity to go to Aranya in the future, I think I will still go to Anlan. The overall facilities and services of the hotel can keep up, because I didn’t expect to comment on it and didn’t take too many photos of the hotel. Let’s post a few sunrises by the sea😄

Tell Butler Qin that it will be resolved very well in the future, so that the birthday is also very happy! I hope the hotel can help me praise these two staff members! The next time I plan to come to Aranya in the summer, I still want to live in Anlan! Amway, this hotel is very cost-effective and the environment is very good. The park has a 24-hour shuttle bus. We wanted to go to the beach at 4:00 in the morning. One downside is that there is no turn-down service. I want to say that the guests return to the hotel after a day and hope to sleep comfortably. I hope the hotel can increase the turn-down service in the room. I believe this will make the hotel even better!

All drinks and snacks in the room are free, full of thoughtful details, and disposable slippers and toothbrushes for children are specially provided. The underfloor heating design makes us warm instantly after watching the frozen sea, even walking barefoot in the bathroom is warm. The hotel's pick-up and parking service can go anywhere in the community. If you want to watch the sunrise, you can make an appoin**ent at the front desk to pick up the parking. The itinerary this time is a bit rushed, I plan to find another time and stay a few more days.
In short, the service, environmental sanitation, and facilities are full marks.
(The only small flaw is that the bathroom door feels a bit tight, and it is a bit difficult to push open and close with small hands) 😜

msg:I like it very much, except that the bed in the twin room is slightly narrower, everything else is very good. The lobby bar on the first floor of the hotel is warm, comfortable and spacious, where you can sit in a daze. The front desk staff and the big sister who cleans the room are very kind and enthusiastic. There is free hot jujube tea at the front desk. There are 10 free bottles of water in the room, which can be refilled, as well as snacks and drinks, and the sofa is also very large, so you can watch TV comfortably. Although breakfast is not included, there is a community cafeteria 100 meters downstairs, which serves breakfast, lunch and dinner, with a variety of delicious and affordable meals. There is also a free nucleic acid point downstairs. The scenery of the community is beautiful, it is very comfortable to go shopping, and the beach is just a walk away. There are many bright stars in the sky at night. In short, Anlan should be the most cost-effective accommodation option in Aranya.

Facilities: The facilities are complete, even children’s toothbrushes and slippers are extra special for children. They are very considerate, but there may be too many people who lived in the peak season before, and the house feels a little old. Some of the corners of the table are painted.

Service: The service is very good! The card in the house also marked the temperature and sunrise time of the next day, which is very considerate. Snacks and drinks are free. I didn’t have enough potato chips and gave me three big bags hahaha

Hygiene: Hygiene is OK

When the weather gets warmer, I will come to Aranya again. I will still live here hh. I feel that the apar**ent style is very suitable for three or five friends to play together.

As for why only four stars are given, I think the downside is that there are no aisles in the public area on the first floor Heating, it's a bit chilly

msg:When booking the hotel, I have told Ctrip and the hotel customer service many times to drive by myself, and be sure to enter the license plate number in advance to avoid the trouble of entering the gate of the Anaya community. Finally, when I entered the park, I still did not enter the car number, so I called the front desk to allow entry.
The hotel environment is good, the check-in and check-out are relatively fast at the front desk, and the handsome foreign guy in the concierge depar**ent is very enthusiastic, helping to deliver luggage to the room and rejecting tips. The room has prepared multiple bottles of free mineral water, welcome drinks and snacks, which are very considerate, and also prepared free disinfectant wipes, alcohol pads and hand sanitizer.
The room facilities and equipment are OK, the service is meticulous, slippers and toothbrushes are prepared for children, and the weather forecast and sunrise time reminders are also prepared.
The hotel has shuttle bus to many places such as Anaya Auditorium, Lonely Library, etc. It is more convenient, with free parking lot, sufficient parking spaces, good location, there is a third canteen and a number of specialty restaurants to choose from when you go out. A stone's throw away from Aranya Arts Centre and Cinema. The fly in the oin**ent is that the hotel only has an outdoor swimming pool and no indoor swimming pool, so swimming is not allowed during this season.
The viewing advertisements placed in the room are under system maintenance after scanning the code. If they cannot be used, consider removing the advertisements.
Because it is during the National Day, the room is not very cost-effective. After a look, the price of staying on weekdays is relatively reasonable.
Nucleic acid testing is very convenient. It is free for hotel guests at the exit of Zone C, which is very user-friendly.
Overall good, recommended!

msg:This time, Qinhuangdao was silent on the day before the check-in. The hotel contacted twice in advance and said that it can be cancelled free of charge. However, we had already arrived in Beidaihe in advance, so we still successfully checked in. During this period, I deeply felt the chaotic management method of the Qinhuangdao local government. There is no public information. The entry and exit management, nucleic acid testing time and place, and visitor reception rules are all based on word of mouth, so there are many mistakes, not to mention the information on the map app is inaccurate. , The announcement time posted by the nucleic acid point itself is not necessarily correct, which has caused us to miss several places. At this time, Anlan has to be praised. Although they can't be 100% accurate, but comparing the information channels of various parties, I feel that his family communicates more diligently to the above, and it is not easy to get the first-hand policy.
After re-evaluating the room, I personally feel that the design is not very practical, so I left more than ten square meters for the balcony, which is not a small area but only has a very cramped bathroom. It may be beautiful to take pictures, but it is a bit uncomfortable to live in. In addition, the curtains are a little gray, and you have to wash your hands after touching them. Others are fine.

If more than one family can live in a homestay, you can choose according to your own requirements. Summer is also a good price. There are many people who bring their babies and pets. It is a good place to stroll around. Satisfied with every aspect of the hotel! The time and price decided that we only stayed for two nights. There are three places to rent a car. The nearest to the hotel is a small car rental. There is a breakfast at the back of the seaside market. The experience is very good! I want to go again and stay at Anlan Hotel!

msg:I am not very satisfied with choosing An Lan as the place where I just want to rest for three days.

First of all, the price/performance ratio is high. Because I have been to Aranya twice before, I didn’t intend to come here for tourism this time. I just saw that the off-season prices on the Internet are relatively low. I want to find a seaside community to rest quietly for a few days. By the way, I can also see the sea. This place is indeed quite suitable.

Secondly, the dissatisfaction is that the sound insulation is not good. On the first night of my stay, I was woken up by a sudden loud sound after going to bed at 10 o'clock, and then the sound of watching TV in the next room lasted for a long time. Helpless, I really couldn't rest, so I changed the room at 11 o'clock in the evening. After three nights of quiet sleep, I was awakened at 7 am on the fourth morning by shouts from a certain room. Helpless, I went out to see the sea and then checked out.

In the end, the service was okay. When encountering problems, the waiters will solve them in time, and there will be cars to pick them up and send them to various places. The mineral water given in the room is really generous, as well as snacks. My favorite is hanging ear coffee, nice.

Suggestion: Every time the food comes, I have to go downstairs to pick it up. I am a lazy person who stays in the room all the time. I am really tired. I hope there can be a food delivery robot~

You can use the hotel's battery car wherever you go in the park, but the speed limit is 15 kilometers recently, so sometimes it's a bit slow during peak hours, so you need to wait. Ms. Gao Lu at the front desk is kind-hearted, and her service is meticulous and thoughtful.

The big bed room where the family 0715 stayed was also extended to No. 27.
Snacks and drinks have been updated many times during my stay in the past two weeks, and there are not always a few. Recently, the drinks include Arctic Ocean Sugar Free Coke and Vitality Forest hahaha. Several kinds of snacks that have been imported recently are also delicious.
The communication between check-in and moving rooms for the elderly at home was very smooth, and I would like to thank Jin Ting for her great help! Really considerate service and excellent problem-solving ability. Anlan has a very good management team. Living here is really like living at home. As long as you have reasonable requirements, from the manager down to every employee you encounter will do their best to help you, kind and warm. Like👍🏻

I would also like to praise Anlan's shuttle bus, which is very convenient, because some restaurants may have to change lines if you take the park bus from the hotel, and now there are many people in the park, and sometimes a car is full and can't get up at all. It's great to wait for the hotel car at the entrance of Anlan, and it will take you directly to the location you want to go to, and you can also pick it up. It's so convenient!

2. The sour plum soup provided in the lobby must be picked up every time you return to the hotel, which is the best way to relieve the heat in the hot summer.
3. Pushing open the door, I saw the warm reminder written by Aunt Liu Na at the bar. The next day, after the room was cleaned, we unexpectedly received a second tip. We were moved and wrote a simple thank-you word with our children, thanking us for providing us with a clean and comfortable living environment.
There are countless beautiful moments like this, as I read on the Internet before the trip, "There are only zero and countless times in Anlan"! Looking forward to seeing you again in Anlan in the near future!

There may be many guests, but can't the hotel that charges 1,770 add a few more phone calls... Other staff are very polite and will greet each other when they meet, and test nucleic acid very convenient

msg:Compliment the hotel. Although it is not at the seaside, the shuttle bus for guests can be delivered at any time. As early as 4:40, there will be a car to take guests to the seaside to watch the sunrise. You can pick up and drop off by calling anywhere in the town. There are two outdoor swimming pools for children and adults. Although it is not big, it is not bad! Snacks and drinks in the room are all free and can be replenished at any time, and hand sanitizer is delivered every day. In the lobby, masks and raincoats are self-collected. In hot weather, there is mung bean soup and sour plum soup to relieve the heat. When it rains, it is immediately replaced with ginger soup. Nucleic acid can be made in the hotel, and it is free for hotel guests. There is a children's playground at the door, and the children's farm is opposite. There are the third canteen, the seaside market, and the town within three to five minutes' walk. There are movie theaters, bookstores and various restaurants and dessert shops in it, all kinds of convenience. This time I live on the first floor, with a small yard, but it will not be noisy, so comfortable

The service and facilities of the hotel are as good as ever, and this time I also prepared snacks for the children, and there are various items in the refrigerator. There are a variety of free drinks, and mineral water is also free to drink (this is my favorite, because many hotels are free 6 bottles), and beverages and food are replenished every day.
It is worth mentioning that I accidentally fell and injured myself while renting a car in Anaya the next day. Du Yanan, the duty manager of the hotel, took the initiative to contact me to ask about the situation and whether to accompany me to see a doctor. Thank you very much. (Hope the hotel can give a show)
I will come again next year, and I will choose Anlan. I also hope that the hotel will get better and better and business will flourish. 🌹🌹🌹🎉🎉🎉

I read online reviews before saying that this hotel can call a car to go to other places, which is very convenient, but I couldn't get in on the phone at all. On the day I left, I called for half an hour to pick us up and waited for another half an hour, and almost missed it. The trains were crying so hard that they didn't even bother to send a car. No one cares about us at all. We waited for an hour for the car with our one-year-old child. The hotel had no breakfast for 2000 a night, the children's room was so big, and there was no swimming pool. Without any service. For the baby stroller rented with a deposit of 1000 yuan, it is extremely difficult to use and cannot be pushed. It didn't give me any pleasant memories, I don't want to come to Aranya again!

There is a special battery car at the entrance of Anlan to take hotel guests to various places in the community. Next to it is the third canteen, which is very convenient to eat breakfast, but there are a lot of people now. When I got up at 4 am to watch the sunrise at the beach, I didn't expect the car to be full. Other swimming facilities are useless. Parking can be done in the outside surface parking lot or in the underground parking lot. Dune Art Museum is not recommended, not everyone who likes to punch in and take pictures.

msg:The first time I went to Anaya, I chose Anlan Hotel. Overall, I felt very good, worthy of the high evaluation of 4.8 points on the Internet. The room is very spacious, the bed is comfortable, the hotel also provides a lot of free snacks and drinks, and the mineral water is unlimited. The service of the hotel is also very warm, both the management staff and the cleaning staff are very service-minded, and they can be heard taking the initiative to say hello to the guests wherever they go. The downside is that the hotel itself does not have restaurants and fitness facilities, and there is an outdoor swimming pool that is very small. Although the whole of Anaya is very convenient to go anywhere, relatively speaking, I prefer to solve everything without going out of the door. The most unsatisfactory point is that the hotel said that self-driving is not allowed to the store, and the pick-up station is also in place, but we still see that many guests drive their own cars to the hotel to check in. The hotel explained that the owner drove there by himself. But are there really so many owners pulling friends to the hotel to stay? Personally, I am skeptical and hope that the standard will be consistent.

1. Queue to check in. At that time, 6 teams lined up and waited for 45 minutes. A very unskilled receptionist booked two rooms. The distance is huge. Is it difficult to arrange in advance? It's already 3 o'clock in the afternoon, so I can come out to a room
2. Turn on the air conditioner next door at night, the air conditioner pipes whistling, shaking headache, I didn't sleep well all night, I told the front desk, it's useless, there is no room and I can't change it. The rooms are old and worn out. Saw a long hair on bathroom toiletries
3. All the rooms are full, and the guest rooms cannot be cleaned. I booked two rooms, got one out, and waited for the other for 2 hours. If you can’t guarantee the quality of service, don’t sell like this to make money, ok?
4. The only advantage is that the free potato chips in the room are delicious

Summary. The hotel is not good in Aranya, and it is not recommended. Or live in folk or club med.

world worth
1. The safety guarantee is first-class. The community entrance staff strictly check the nucleic acid and check-in information. The foreign vehicles must communicate with the housekeeper as soon as possible, and enter the license plate in advance.
Second, we must praise the thoughtful design of the hotel. Each room has a terrace. In order to prevent mosquitoes in summer, there are special anti-mosquito sliding doors. Sleeping with the window of the balcony open at night, you can not only feel the coolness of summer, but also don’t have to worry about it. Mosquito, very satisfied~
3. Qinhuangdao's unique beach, the moment you step on it, the first feedback on your skin's touch is that it is so soft and delicate. It is worthy of being a golden beach. The sand is very clean (it is said to have been finely ground) Intimate tips: and A faucet that can flush your feet.

It is less than a five-minute walk from the three canteens. It is very convenient to eat. The service staff in the hotel lobby can take you to any place in the park by shuttle bus, which is very convenient. The snacks and drinks in the hotel are all free. The room layout is reasonable. Service staff and beautiful views! ! I really recommend it~~~

msg:The first time I left the hotel, I immediately commented, because I really enjoyed my stay! From the moment we entered the door, we felt the enthusiasm of the staff. After checking in, the lovely little sister Doudouer took us directly to the door of the room, and added WeChat to communicate at any time. In the room, there are snacks, fruits, and super-sufficient drinking water for guests, as well as slippers, toothbrushes, quilts, etc. for children.
In particular, I want to praise Doudouer. First of all, this little fairy is really a little beautiful hahahaha, and more importantly, she is super gentle and careful, and the communication is timely and smooth. In the evening, I asked my colleague to help deliver the foot bath bucket. I was a little late when I checked out, and helped me to delay the check out time.
As a person who loves to travel, I have stayed in many high-end resort hotels, large and small. Anlan is definitely regarded as the top service. It is not the kind of professional and stylized service, but it makes people feel very warm. The room facilities are slightly used, but for the price of several hundred yuan, it is still very cost-effective.

The three hotels have been struggling to choose which one to choose. Then I saw on the Internet that Anlan has a teacher’s certificate and can get a discount. It’s not too sweet to stay at 300. The hotel is clean and hygienic, the shampoo is very easy to use, the waiters are very polite, and even the aunt who sweeps the floor will take the initiative to chat. Very close to the three canteens, easy to eat. Recommended.

advantage:
1. The room is large and neat, with a bar area. The balcony is also huge.
2. A large variety of snacks and drinks in the room are all free (but there is no welcome fruit as mentioned in the comments, it may be a different standard room).
3. Very clean and tidy, all necessities are complete and of good quality.
4. Service awareness, service level and attitude are very good.
5. The front desk provides warm baby and park shuttle bus services.
6. I saw the comments that the hot water in the bath is short, but I did not find this problem, the hot water is sufficient and the temperature is sufficient.

There are also small things that are not particularly satisfying, and the flaws do not hide the good.
1. There is no restaurant, even the nearest third canteen, you have to go out. It's not very convenient when it rains.
2. About 15 minutes walk from the beach, not too close.
3. The Wi-Fi speed in the room is not very fast (instead, the Wi-Fi speed in the cafeteria is faster).
4. I highly recommend Anlan Hotel, a very pleasant stay experience.

🍃Environment: The beauty of Anaya can only be experienced in person. The whole person living here is very comfortable. The beautiful sea of oranges can make people feel free. Highly recommended to check in. ～～～

It is not clear that I went to other expressway intersections and refused to give up. I queued for 3 hours in vain. After checking in at the hotel, I asked why I couldn't just drive the car into the park, put down my luggage and drive out. There is no positive answer. The hotel does not have its own breakfast. Many people solve the breakfast problem at the bar counter. The waiters don’t know what dishes can be made and what are not available. They can forget after ordering. I asked in 30 minutes, only to say that I forgot to make it . Squeeze juice out of rotten apples in front of me and throw them away only after being reminded. I will never go there again.

🚗 Transportation: It is located in Anaya community, one hour away from Qinhuangdao Station, which is very convenient.
🔔Service: It was midnight when I arrived at the store. The front desk staff quickly checked in. When I entered the room, I saw the water and snacks carefully prepared by the hotel. I was really surprised. Biscuits, dried fruits, etc. are all very good brands, which can be seen in the hotel. Very hard.
🍃Environment and facilities: Downstairs is a large lawn, which should be beautiful in spring and summer. The room is not big, but the facilities are very complete. The bathroom is very convenient for dry and wet separation. The shower floor is warm and it is very comfortable to step on it to take a bath. Because it is a room next to the stairs, the balcony is so big that you can run on it. In summer, it should be very comfortable to sit on the balcony and enjoy the cool.
        The hotel does not have a canteen, but the third canteen is accessible from the back door, which is very convenient for eating. On the way to the cafeteria, I saw several places where you can get mineral water and towels for free. The hotel really pays attention to details and feels very good.

2. The hotel basically has no service. They never carry suitcases. After checking the order several times, they only find out. The shuttle bus is not smooth, and the experience in all aspects is too bad.
3. Do not book during the epidemic, only residents of Anlan cannot drive into the park. People saw that you were very inconvenient and upset. The hotel manager came to comfort me and said to report to the property, but there was no result for half an hour.

msg:I went to the northeast and passed by and chose the Anaya Anlan Hotel. I was worried that the rooms in the seaside resort hotel would be cold in the off-season. But it's so caring that the hotel has fully opened in advance and the floor heating and air-conditioning are warm as summer. The room is spacious forty to fifty square meters divided into guest bedroom area. The bedding is very new, so I can rest assured that I bring my own. The point is that the service experience is very good. Every employee in the corridor elevator at the front desk smiles pleasantly. There is a warm reminder of the weather forecast by the housekeeper Zhao Lijuan at the bar in the room. The husband felt that there was some noise in the outdoor unit on the balcony. The housekeeper service immediately checked and was positive. After arranging a room change, I felt troublesome, so I didn’t change and didn’t get disturbed to sleep. There is no restaurant in the hotel. It is convenient and cheap to go out to the third canteen next to the hotel and the first canteen a few hundred meters away to experience the daily life of Anaya residents. To drive, you must report the license plate number of the Anaya Gate to the hotel before letting go. You can park on the ground next to the hotel. The underground garage cannot directly reach the entrance and exit of the hotel outside the hotel. It is recommended to stop the car at the entrance of the hotel lobby and check in and take your luggage before you go to the parking lot. The hotel also has valet parking. There is also a very thoughtful experience of the shuttle bus. Looking forward to staying more comfortably for a few more days at Anaya Anlan Hotel next time

🔔Service: The key point I want to say is that the service at his home is really good. We went there at night and it was almost 11 o’clock and we ran into sister Xiao Yao. Because we came here for the first time and introduced us to the park. We said that we wanted to watch the sunrise. My sister also sent us a facial mask and a warm baby sticker. It was so caring. The hotel also asked us if we need a wake-up service. There will be a special car to the beach. It is very convenient to return after watching the sunrise. You can have to soak the foot basin and there is a medicine bag in the foot bath, which is beyond my expectation😌
Sister Xiao Yao also specially sent us magazines and lights for taking pictures. I feel that Sister Yao is really a treasure chest😂
The snacks and drinks in the room are free🆓 The room is very good as a whole, and many of the designs are great. The point is that I really like the service of their house. The caring is in place. I will definitely choose their house next time I come. Highly recommend!

There was also a set of Bulgari trial kits for toiletries and baby toothbrushes, baby slippers, and Dyson hair dryer on the table. With the weather tips for these two days and the sunrise time of the next day, we are going to watch the sunrise and booked a hotel shuttle bus in advance. It is really too convenient. The next morning it has been foggy and told us that we don’t have to leave in a hurry. The room staying at Anlan Hotel feels very good. It’s not a reservation.

🍃Environment: The location is close to the center of the neighborhood, which belongs to the city center of Anaya. It does not rely on the sea. It is strongly recommended to borrow a bicycle from the town square opposite the hotel to facilitate travel

msg:I have been thinking about the trip to Anaya, and compared it repeatedly before leaving, and finally chose Anlan Hotel. After checking in, we all felt that choosing this hotel was a wise decision.
The hotel is quite good and the service is superb. The weather is beginning to fall, and there is a stomach-warming ginger and jujube tea in the lobby, which makes you feel warm after drinking it. There are a lot of small snacks in the room, and there are battery cars to and from the room, and it is online 24 hours. All hotel staff will greet you cordially when they meet you. We also chose to stay here for another night on our return trip. When we checked out the next day, the waiter who checked in on the first day recognized us. I really want to ask the hotel how you make the staff working in the hotel so considerate.
I thought about it when I left, and next time I must bring my parents to Anaya to live in Anlan.

Ctrip communicated with the license plate by phone in advance to make entering the park smooth. It happened that it was raining on the day of check-in, because my mother's station was far away from Anlan, the concierge Oda took me to pick it up as soon as I learned, thank you very much. You can be a child who can play in the rain and tread water when you enter the ideal country, and you can also be an adult who shelters from the wind and rain when you leave Anaya.

msg:As a Ctrip platinum member, I have stayed in nearly 100 hotels around the world. I have encountered all kinds of strange things in this Anlan Hotel, and I blamed me. I didn’t choose Club Med because I brought the elderly because I was afraid of noise. So if you want to have a happy vacation, don’t choose this hotel. Don’t be lucky and think that it won’t be your turn with so many good reviews. Once it’s your turn, it’s over. I didn’t come across this hotel after traveling all over the world. A wonderful hotel?
        1. The hair dryer was broken, and I asked someone to check it out, and the attitude was very bad, saying that it was an induction, you don’t know how to use it, but after he saw it, it was indeed broken. 2. The shower gel is gone on the third night of staying, and other hotels are fully prepared. 3. The hotel facilities are simple, rust stains and stains can be seen everywhere. 4. The quilt cover was not changed for three days. 5. The front desk staff of the hotel took two centimeters of eyelash extensions and nails of the Empress Dowager Cixi. The other one was naked. 6. I called the hotel before and asked where the nucleic acid test was done. The attitude was very bad, and I was weak in speaking. I thought something happened to the employee's home. 7. The cleaning made water everywhere, and I almost slipped and fell. 8. The door cannot be closed automatically, you have to pull hard to close it. 9. The hot water is limited to 80 liters (only enough for 2 people or 1 person for a long time), and you have to wait for another 15 minutes after use. 10. It is not safe to enter the elevator without swiping the room card. 11. There is a musty smell when entering the room, and the ventilation is useless. We still live on the fifth floor. 12. Asked the front desk to arrange a quiet room, but in the end it was arranged in a room facing the playground. Is it intentional? Every day the people below make noise until almost ten o'clock. 13. The employee who came to pick up the luggage after checking out yawned loudly. I was really stunned. I have never met such a person. He chatted on his mobile phone in the elevator, and when the luggage was pushed to the lobby, he disappeared. Didn't even say a word to us. 14. The most exasperating thing is that it rained all day on the last day, and I went to the hotel basement from the outside. There was no floor mat in the basement, which caused a lot of rain, and the child slipped down the stairs, sliding 5.6 steps. Looking for hotel theory, the manager of the guest relations depar**ent tested me step by step, first upgrade the suite, we are the last night, and you definitely don't need to upgrade. Then I was asked to stay one more day, and the child started school on the 11th, which is definitely not possible. I also said free room coupons. I will definitely not come to this kind of hotel for the second time. Finally, I said the check-out fee. I said yes. The manager looked at it and said that you booked for three nights. Even if it's late, this matter is over. As a result, after half an hour, I asked him when he would refund the money, and he refused to admit it. I have no experience in dealing with this kind of thing, and I have no written evidence or video recording. It was the front desk manager who made a special lie because the money came from her, and she didn't want to pay it, so she lied together with the manager of the guest relations depar**ent. A hotel that has no responsibility at all, talks back and forth. Later, they said that I would be refunded 240, but I disagreed, and they said that I would be refunded for one night's room fee. In the end, the police were called, but it was useless to call the police. They couldn't do the trick, and they couldn't coordinate well in the end. Later, Ctrip made up the price difference for me. In the afternoon, the front desk manager also said that the non-slip mat should be put on quickly, but it was not put on at night (see Figure 5). The front desk manager is really a capable person. He lied without changing his face and heartbeat. He has done so many things on his heart. Let's see when the retribution will come to you. 15. The only advantage is that the cleaning aunts are very good, and everyone will greet you warmly.
        Basically, I don’t give bad reviews to the hotel, because I am very satisfied. I have two long reviews, one is dedicated to the Westin Sanya Lingshui, and the second is Anaya Anlan. The only luck now is that I came here in the off-season, and I don’t have much money for one night. Those who spend thousands of dollars a night during the peak season are probably even more unlucky. The room is too small, the bathroom can only accommodate one person, and the sink countertop is so small The toothbrush can be put down, the overall decoration feels very simple, and there are flies everywhere in October. If you want to stay in a hotel, you still have to live in an international chain hotel, and the service and after-sales services are guaranteed.

The cleaning aunt and the front desk brother came to help at night. There are a lot of snacks in our hotel room. The key point is to tell the little brother at the front desk that the potato chips in the hotel room are delicious. Then he brought us four packs and a lot of water. It’s really great and the hotel is free. The shuttle bus is very convenient to go where to talk to the hotel and it’s ok.

The lobby of the hotel is very quiet and suitable for rest. The fountain at the entrance is very popular with babies. The slides, trampolines and sandpits at the entrance are perfect facilities for babies. The balcony is very large, but there are more bed bugs, so be careful to close the screens.
The lady at the front desk arranged a sea-view room. Although it is blocked by the hidden apar**ent, the scenery is still beautiful, but this half is farther away from the three canteen, and you can’t have both fish and bear paws.
The hotel has a dedicated battery car, which is very convenient to go out.

msg:Here are the reasons for Ding An Lan Hotel. The facts have also proved that it is as good as the evaluation.


① The location is not facing the sea, but it was 10 minutes after a stroll, just opposite the fourth phase apar**ent where we stayed last time. It is very close to the town, the third canteen, and the children’s farm, and not far from the first canteen. There are many places to eat and drink around.

There is a playground for children downstairs. There is a beach, a slide, a trampoline belt, a swimming pool (closed when we went, and open during summer), and a lawn, which is very suitable for family travel.


② Transportation, first, parking in the park is free during the stay, and it is extended to 6 pm on the day of check-out. Secondly, there is the hotel's own shuttle bus, which can be picked up and delivered by car in the park. Yes, not only for delivery, but also for picking up, and you can also make an appoin**ent to watch the sunrise. Although there are also shuttle buses in the park, there are definitely no hotel shuttle buses as convenient for regular routes.


③ Service, all staff will take the initiative to say hello, and any needs will be basically met.

I arranged a Ctrip staff to call me one day in advance, confirm the order, the previous itinerary, and whether there are any requirements for the room, and also actively reminded me whether the hotel has 7 floors and whether I need a room with a high-level view. Although, when I submitted the order, I commented it out, but because the customer service staff was too friendly, I patiently said it again.

One day, when I wanted to use the washing spirit, I asked the service staff and was very enthusiastic to help me find it. There was no room in the guest room area and I went to the staff canteen for me. It was so nice.

The rule is to check in at 3 pm, we arrived less than 1 o’clock, and we checked in directly; if we wanted to postpone our check out for a while, the front desk watched us with the children, and especially happily agreed to postpone it by one hour.


④ For the room, we have set a large-bed room with a view, which is a basic room type. The bed is 2m*2m2, with a super large balcony. You can see the garden view and the distant sea view hahaha.


There is a small pantry with a basin and a drain rack. Emma, I don’t need to brush the baby bottle in the bathroom every day, and the feeling of draining the floor is so good.

The hotel provides children’s bed circumference, wash stool, bathtub, toiletries, bathrobes, slippers; when booking the bed circumference, the front desk also specifically asked whether we need one or two, which helped us install it on the side + foot of the bed and let us sleep. It's pretty down to earth. This is also a better place than homestays. There are not many homestays that provide beds around. Usually I can only choose the one with big tatami mats.

There are many free drinks and snacks in the room, such as Coke, Arctic Ocean, Oolong tea, sparkling water, Wangzi milk, and bottled drinking water. Drink up to 8 bottles a day. There are also several kinds of snacks, which will make up every day. Although we didn't eat them, we saw that the child gave another funny egg.

In short, a very satisfying staying experience. It is recommended for a family of two or three. It is very cost-effective and cheaper than other two-room homestays (at the same time, the fourth-phase bungalows are 780, the fourth-phase apar**ents are 850, and others are even more expensive. Taller). Although breakfast is not provided, there is a third cafeteria downstairs from the hotel, which is quite convenient~

msg:I have been to Anaya many times. I always like to live in Pulan because it’s close to the beach~ I didn’t book a room this time. I chose Anlan, which is also very good. The room is larger than Pulan’s, but the location is relatively far away. It is very close to the third canteen, the waiters are friendly, the bedding and the room are clean, the balcony does not see the sea, but the living is very safe and comfortable.

msg:聽説過阿那亞這個項目 一直想來看看 看到安瀾酒店的評價 很 高 決定來試試  本來定了四天 後面又續住了兩天 淡季酒店價格很合適 之初會擔心服務問題會不會因為淡季不好 但接到酒店電話後打消了我的顧慮 客服很細心的提示了 疫情政策和報備車牌號 還有温度提示 到達酒店後丁琪懿經理給我留下了深刻的印象 從倒棗茶到引領到房間 到後面續住 和離店，全程服務到位很細節，會根據客人狀況選擇幫客人介紹 比如説海風酒吧的啤酒就很不錯  冬天比較乾燥 主動為我加加濕器 這個細節也很感動 包括離店提醒 到達問候 總之酒店各位服務人員都很熱情 看到三亞也開了新項目 有機會還會去看看

He is very professional and very professional. The hotel is also good. It is already good in the scenic area. No, it can’t be compared with the five-star hotels in the city. It’s still very good. The next thing is what I feel is not enough. 1. The hotel did not notify me in advance that the car cannot enter Anaya. Please inform the customer in advance in the future. 2, The shuttle bus is broken, I hope it can be improved, and the time is a bit long. Waiting in the sun on such a hot day is really unbearable. 3. There are too many people in the Anaya canteen, especially in the morning, everyone still staggers the peak time to eat, that's it, finally, we must give special praise to Manager Yao, who is very professional

Standing on the balcony, you can listen to the sound of the rain, watch the sunset and admire the moon, which is super awesome. The big lawn downstairs of the hotel, the swimming pool, and the children’s playground opposite the hotel are all favorites of children. It is worth mentioning that the hotel knows that the children are celebrating their birthdays, so they carefully arranged the rooms and quietly gave them a birthday cake. It is a pleasant surprise for the children. The overall service of the hotel is very good, the waiter is very polite, the sanitation and cleaning are also very clean, and the small food in the room tastes good. In short, Anlan is a place where children are reluctant to leave. I made an agreement with the two children at home, and I will go to Anaya again when I have a chance, and I will still live in Anlan.

The most prominent is the hotel battery car service. Relatively speaking, Anlan has more battery cars. It is very convenient to go to the park.
The reason for not giving full marks is that the sound of the air conditioner outside the room affects sleep. Others are good.

In the center of the community, about 15 minutes' walk away from the sea, you can use the hotel shuttle bus. When there is no car, you can also contact the lobby to pick you up. It is very close to the third canteen. There are Subways around the third canteen. Small shops such as Coconut Life are all good. Diagonally opposite the hotel is the supermarket at the seaside market, which is very convenient. The check-in time is not long, the swimming pool is colder because of the cold weather, and it happened to be in time for the inspection and maintenance last Thursday. The staff are very amiable. During the child's heatstroke, the staff gave Huoxiang Zhengqi and an ear thermometer, went to the infirmary and made a special trip to instruct the driver of the shuttle bus. The infirmary in the community is very good. There are doctors for consultations 24 hours a day. The prices of medicines are also very close to the people. The greenery and style of the whole Anaya are very good, the staff are very polite, and the consumption is generally high, but it is acceptable for a small stay. Next time I will choose Anaya and Anlan.

msg:Choosing Anlan is the most correct one. Apart from the fact that you can’t look at the sea directly from the hotel, the location is definitely at an advantage. It is not far from going to the seaside market or to the auditorium. Living in Zone F can be directly connected to the third dining hall from the back door. Don’t be too convenient. There is also a direct elevator, which is convenient for bringing baby strollers. The hotel also has a dedicated shuttle bus. You can go wherever you want. There is also an underground parking lot.
I asked for a fence with the front desk because I brought my baby. The arrangements were made before check-in. The hotel lobby also prepared cold and hot drinks for passengers. The service staff are very enthusiastic to help you solve problems or ask if you need help! This time the time is a bit short, next time I will choose Anlan to stay for a few more days.

Because Anlan has a shuttle bus on call 24 hours a day, and the staff are very kind, as long as you call the hotel, they will come to pick you up! Although the hotel facilities are not luxurious, they are very clean. For breakfast, it is also very close to the third cafeteria, just downstairs. The lobby view is also great, from the inside to the outside is very clear. I will choose Anlan next time!

As a result, I kept asking for money on my way back to Beijing on Sunday, and I kept getting calls during a meeting at work today. I'm really speechless. You keep harassing me about your mistakes at work. It has been forwarded to someone via WeChat. It's very disturbing. Then we all left the hotel, and I found out from the Internet that there were buses to pick up the attractions, and there were foot baths and the like. I don’t know if it’s because there are too many Chris**as people on Chris**as Eve, but it’s not as good as other reviews said. The money has been transferred to the front desk WeChat. Please neither Ctrip nor the front desk ask for a landline or personal number, and please do not contact me again.

msg:The location of Anlan's hotel is relatively central.
I have stayed in Anlan twice before and after. The peak season in summer is obviously not as good as in winter. Is it too busy and negligent?
According to the regulations, I called a few days in advance to file the license plate, but when I arrived at the gate of Anaya, I still didn't let it go. They said that there was no license plate in the system. I went to the front desk and they said there was a record and filed again. I don't know if it is an Anaya system problem or a hotel problem.
It is not convenient for the ba*****t to have no direct elevator to the hotel, and it is very troublesome to take luggage.
I told the little brother at the front desk that he didn't want the head and tail rooms, and he still murmured about the head and tail rooms. Then I got the room card and went upstairs, um, the last room at the end of the corridor. I found it troublesome, so I didn't change it.
The service attitude is pretty good.
The touch hair dryer in the room is really not easy to use, and the sensing location is a bit difficult to find. Girls with small hands can't sense it if they want to change the holding direction.

From check-in at the front desk, to the cleaning staff, and then to the exclusive customer service Ding Qiyi, all are all-round caring and meticulous service.
1. Front desk: you can quickly check in during the peak check-in period, and patiently answer the choice of floors and rooms;
2. Room service staff: can remember our preferences for snacks, drinks and fruits in a short time, and clean in time;
3. Dedicated customer service Xiaoding: A small accident during the check-in process can also be responded to and dealt with in the fastest time; ask what items need to be added every day, the rhythm and frequency are just right, to give us timely help, but also to keep a suitable distance , Makes us feel courteous and courteous; he also took the initiative to arrange taxis for us, very meticulous.
4. Highlights: hotel special car and driver, professional service.
In short, a week that is not long or short, in the warmth of Anlan, makes the movie-watching experience and holiday experience, whether it is peak season or during the working day, very comfortable and cozy.
Next time I have the opportunity, I will stay. Thanks 🌹

It is very convenient to go to the town for coffee, dinner or to the beach. The hotel has its own shuttle bus, which can be used outside the lobby for further trips.

The environment in the hotel is also not bad, the room is a little small. The next day, the room was cleaned and the supplies and supplies were very timely. The staff that met will also greet the guests.

The reception staff at the front desk will be much better! All the women who come across before and after are the same customer service, every time they have not finished the business of the guests at hand, they go to participate in the problems of other guests. It is very rude. It seems that she must handle all the things at the front desk. Only she can handle them.

The hotel staff is very polite and will greet them and ask if they need help. The accessories in the room are also very attentive, although I travel alone, but it does not prevent the cuteness of children's toiletries and children's slippers, hahaha. The bedside card reminds that the hotel provides five types of pillows for guests to choose from. Gang Zhenfu silently complained about the five types of pillows when I saw it. Isn’t that a bit too exaggerated, but after a month in Guilin’s hotels, I can only sleep When it comes to soft and high pillows... I think... the five pillows... are also very considerate...

It doesn’t matter if it’s sunny or sunny, but it’s very inconvenient if it rains. Although the hotel’s shuttle bus has tried its best to solve this problem, getting on and off the bus to catch up with the belt on rainy days The baby has a lot of luggage and it is very frustrating, I don't quite understand this setting...
In addition, if you live on the first floor leading to the third canteen, it will be very noisy. People have to pass through the corridor, and even if you go out, you have to walk for a while to get to the canteen... It is also inconvenient.
The service attitude of the cleaning staff in the hotel room is very good. This point must be praised. The mattress is also relatively comfortable. The toilet has a bit of an unpleasant smell. It is too good to go in in the morning~

缺點也很明顯，離海邊有步行十多分鐘的距離，這點看入住人自己取捨。早餐中規中矩，因為價格本身也不高，所以性價比前可以。
最大的不足是週六中午12點多前台辦理入住的一位黑衣制服的東北口音女服務員，説話特別噎人。可以理解阿那亞旺季來了，但進旋轉門的禮賓台、見到的每一位都會面帶微笑問個好，這位真是獨一份。具體細節不表，因為後來值班經理出來妥善處理了，拉回一些好感。

環境：大堂門口就是小童遊樂區 適合遛娃。我們之前住過海邊 所以對海景沒有要求 其實安瀾離三食堂很近 吃飯也方便
服務：服務確實很好 每個人都打招呼 工作人員充足

msg:1、與之前相比體驗感下降很多，酒店的成本管控明顯，如:①房間內標準發放的瓶裝水由原先的十瓶降為八瓶，零食和飲料的種類數量有所減少；濕紙巾，擦眼鏡紙，耳塞，黑夾子不再主動提供；手提袋由2個減少為1個等。②前台接待處的位置沒有擺放濕紙巾和礦泉水。③三點後入住不再贈送餐廳券、游泳票、電影票等，詢問前台小姐姐説是因為沒有合作了。④即使連續入住，潤膚乳也不主動提供第二支了，需要拿着空管到前台換，退房時即使拿出了空管表情看着也是冷淡的。
2、因為是連續入住，上午吃早點回來還想休息一會，門上也一直掛着請勿打擾的牌子，還被問了兩次什麼時候可以打掃房間。有生之年住酒店第一次遇到，問一遍我能理解，為什麼還會有第二遍？！
3、酒店接駁車等車時間比之前要長很多，非週末還會等二十分鐘，酒店是否考慮再增加些車次呢？
4、酒店設施磨損率很高，沙發套看着很臟。整體住宿感覺基本就是亞朵和全季酒店的水平，早餐也很一般。
5、沒有提供歡迎水果，沒有管家服務。
6、大堂提供的新飲品洛神花茶太甜了，建議給不喜歡糖的住客提供一些茶水（例如玫瑰普洱，陳皮白茶等）也是不錯的選擇。
7、住店期間把車開出去玩以後再回來，大門口的電子設備識別不出來了，還得人工核查身份碼登記，非常不方便。

當然，還有值得肯定的地方，比如給打客服電話基本上是有求必應的，禮賓部服務暖心，保潔阿姨打招呼也比之前熱情了很多，有加大碼一次性拖鞋提供。如果第一次來可能會覺得不錯，來了很多次以後就覺得減配還是挺明顯的，如果標準還下降，以後再來阿那亞要考慮其他酒店了。

msg:去年暑期帶娃住的隱廬，環境不錯但是離海邊有點距離。這次選擇了位置比較適中的安瀾，溜達去周邊各處都比較方便。帶娃步行去海邊的話，10分鐘以內就踩在沙灘上了。停車也比較方便，地上地下都有車位。

雙人床的床比較窄，但是沙發特別寬敞，可以直接改成一張小床，165身高以內的話可以睡得妥妥的，小朋友還挺喜歡自己睡沙發的。浴室的換氣扇出現了一點問題，酒店的肖經理第一時間給予瞭解決方案，專業又貼心。打掃房間的阿姨們也很熱情，每次打招呼都讓人覺得很親切。

酒店門口的小童區正在改造，不過馬路對面是小童農場和咖啡廣場，也是可以讓家長消磨一會兒。整體來説，還是不錯的選擇。

酒店設施齊全，環境特別好，在阿那亞社區裏是很大的酒店了，特別火。
房間裏的飲料小吃都是免費的，大堂的紅棗茶也很好喝。
工作人員服務周到熱情，會主動打招呼，解答疑問。接駁車很多，到哪裡都很方便。
客房用的洗漱用品我很喜歡，是很好聞的木質香，用過之後我還特意買了身體乳！！
總之，下次再來我還會選安瀾的！

msg:安瀾的祛魅之旅—安瀾在網上營銷真的太好了，營銷服務和品質，去之前在小紅書**平台也是一水的誇服務多麼多好，去過生日，期待值拉滿，然而還沒進到安瀾，就完成了祛魅：1、前台電話難以打通，通話常常被掛斷。2、我從秦皇島站下車打到出租車艱難的打通了前台電話，報備了進入的車牌號，發微信到服務公眾號提交了車牌號，車程一個小時，到達園區沒門車輛訊息未錄入，無法進入園區。3、被攔在門口慌張聯繫酒店，前台電話依然很難打通，連播了37通終於打通，火氣上漲情緒有些許激動問為什麼沒有錄入車牌號怎麼解決，工作人員沒有解答沒有解決，電話被切斷。此時我已經火冒三丈，社區門衞的工作人員全程見證了過程，提出查看我的訂單和預訂人身份證可以對行人放行，我衹能步行進入，走到安瀾大概10分鐘，期間也沒有酒店工作人員聯繫我為我解決問題。到達酒店前台直接要求值班經理出麪解釋，解釋説會調查，目前離店24小時，也沒有被反饋調查結果。經理安排了我2點入住，送了一份水果盤，安排一個客户關係的經理送我到客房，這就是全部的解決方案，此時我對酒店的管理和服務已經失望透頂了。不過還是要表揚一下工作人員王茜，在我火氣沖頭説話懟人的情況下，也熱情的服務了我，還讓我加了她的微信有事可以直接找到她。以上，體驗差到極致，有時間在網絡上營銷，多做做管理和服務吧，不會再去，不會推薦給朋友，糟糕透頂，前台經理多去其他酒店學學吧。生日在安瀾過真的太后悔。


設施：17年的酒店設施老舊，酒店價格也不便宜，雖然是淡季折扣，服務也跟不上。有一説一生日房間佈置是可以的。

安瀾在園區入門不遠去就是 初來阿那亞肯定要逛逛的 安瀾距離周圍吃飯喝咖啡都很方便的 去海邊走路10分鐘 坐車過去也很快 對於剛入園區熟悉環境 很友好
酒店熱情nice 前台的棗茶很好喝 直接拿保温杯過去接就行 熱情的前台還給裝了幾袋棗 開心

設施：房間裏有個挺大沙發帶孩子的可睡人。單人床有些窄，實話説好久沒睡過這麼窄的床了跟酒店整體定位不符。洗手間枱麪空間很小基本放不下什麼東西。廁所非智能馬桶且沖水聲音巨大，建議安個靜音馬桶，晚上起夜沖水跟放炮一樣。
服務：酒店服務沒得説，尤其門口禮賓部的小夥子們，每次都是耐心的登記我們需要接駁的地點。雖然工作很單調無趣，但每次看見他們都很熱情的詢問每一位客人，能做到始終如一真是不容易，前台的小姐姐應該向他們學習。
入住期間，贈送小食及飲品都是免費續的，這個點個大大的贊👍。

以上為對比蘇卡酒店的優勢。我們是安瀾蘇卡連住。

msg:酒店位置基本在阿那亞的中心，靠近第三食堂（在包子鋪的地下一層），基本兩點左右到就可以辦理入住，服務人員還是很有眼力見的，進門處有傳説中的熱乎的紅棗桂圓冰糖水，在寒冷的冬季還是帶給我無比温暖的。晚上要了兩個泡腳桶和草葯包，配上自帶的面膜手膜，做了一個足浴“***”。需要提醒大家的是酒店地暖需長摁面板進行調節、投屏看電視可能會需要近一個小時的電視適配；需要改進的一是衞生間沒有小洗臉巾，二是房間裏也沒有表和音箱，不想看電視想聽聽音樂都不行，三是房間都吹風機放在壁櫥而不在浴室裏，洗完澡吹頭髮滿屋子找吹風機；需要酒店在攜程網的酒店服務介紹中把ktv一項刪除，因為酒店自身根本就沒有KTV，更別提服務了，KTV在步行10分鐘的社區，自己沒有就不要硬加這個項目，虛假宣傳，給住客造成不必要的麻煩。

1.我們是一點左右辦理的入住登記，因為提前溝通了生日佈置所以很早就讓我們入住啦，還準備了蛋糕~
2.房間很大很乾凈，陽台很美，如果是夏天可以坐在外面喝酒聊天。零食很多，入住期間經常會詢問我們喜歡吃哪些要不要補，服務很好。
3.唯一美中不足就是聖誕季人太多了，導致接駁車要等很久很久，產生了一點點不愉快，但是酒店後續的處理太棒了，特別特別要誇讚一下吳曉恬小姐姐，太貼心了，因為知道我們接駁車等了很久，怕感冒在我們回來前準備了蛋糕和泡腳桶，還趕在我們回來前送了兩大杯紅棗茶在房間，太貼心了。臨走時還送了我們紅棗茶包和身體乳，謝謝恬恬的暖心服務，值得我們再來安瀾一百次~

msg:安瀾在園區裏性價比第一沒得説。酒店接駁車24小時供應，零食飲料不限量，衹要要了就給補（這個綠色的薯片真的爆好吃）阿姨打掃房間很認真，還給疊衣服，聖誕節去的今天入住人很多也沒有混亂的情況，需求都能供應到位，而且安瀾接駁車比較多，在園區裏走一走經常能遇到安瀾的車順着就回去了。很方便。早幾年來過一次安瀾還沒有這麼多服務。現在真的是太周到了，所有服務人員態度都很好。非常滿意。

msg:首先，我要特別表揚酒店經理王金婷。她在整個入住期間展現出了出色的專業素養和關懷。王經理始終以微笑和熱情的態度對待每位客人，她對細節的關注和周到的照顧讓我感到賓至如歸。她不僅迅速解決了我提出的需求和問題，還給予了有價值的建議和推薦。她的關注和關心讓我感受到了真正的個性化服務。

其次，酒店的房間和設施非常出色。房間寬敞明亮，裝飾雅緻，一切都整潔有序。床鋪舒適，讓我每晚都能享受寧靜的睡眠。浴室提供了高品質的洗浴用品。

酒店的餐飲服務也令我印象深刻。早餐提供了豐富多樣的選擇，品質優秀。酒店餐廳的菜品口味出眾，服務熱情周到。

酒店的位置非常便利，周邊去哪裡都沒有很遠。酒店提供的接駁車服務也非常方便。

總的來説，我對阿那亞安瀾酒店的入住體驗非常滿意。酒店經理王金婷和整個團隊的專業和熱情讓我感到賓至如歸。我衷心推薦這家酒店給所有尋找舒適住宿和優質服務的旅客。如果我再次來到這個地區，我肯定會選擇再次入住阿那亞安瀾酒店。

酒店位置也很棒，通勤車超級方便隨叫隨到，甚至半夜12點突發奇想去海邊溜達小哥哥也超級耐心的車接車送，還幫帶了紅棗茶，體驗感簡直不要太好，
安瀾廳的早餐品種也應有盡有，不過因為週六人比較多，需要排隊，但是很值！品種挺多也都很好吃！
之前入住有加過王金婷經理的vx，這次入住期間有遇到任何問題也都十分照顧，有求必應，有問必答，超級美膩且暖心的小姐姐！安瀾第一好٩（•̤̀ᵕ•̤́๑）！下次見啦🩷

冬天步行確實冷，酒店提供免費的接駁車，出行太絲滑。一進門有人幫忙拿行李，端棗茶，確實服務太棒！
還特別想表揚一下王唯一經理，從check in開始就特別有親和力，細心介紹園區和好吃的好玩兒的，而且不管在上班下班都回復消息很及時，主動噓寒問暖，晚上回來還貼心的準備了泡腳桶和紅棗茶讓我們暖身子，感覺賓至如歸！這次也是因為有了她的幫助和關照，給我們第一次阿那亞之行留下了100分印象！
Ps：這次點燈太美太熱鬧了，大家聚在一起一點也不會感覺冷，這才是節日的氛圍呀～希望下次春暖花開，我們能再見！

推薦酒店的早餐，因為天氣太冷，吃飽了再出去對大人孩子都非常友好。 酒店裡每個遇見的服務人員都會温暖的問好。在不缺品牌與理念的時代，服務的標準和客户最後的體驗才能給予更長久的感受。

最後説一下，酒店給客人們準備的紅棗水太好喝了😆

安瀾酒店位於阿那亞園區中心，園區內交通便利，接駁車也很方便。衞生乾淨，服務熱情，早餐非常豐富。陽台有晾衣架，總之細節滿滿。
同一周入住了很多阿那亞的酒店，勸大家不要找了，安瀾真的是阿那亞假日酒店性價比之王。期待下次再來。

msg:1,園區內的設施不錯，適合帶孩子放電。
2，房間的設施一般，衞生條件沒有想象中的好，但是床擋好評，主動問需不需要。
3，早餐種類不多，不過有幾樣還不錯：蒸餃、麪條等等。
4，非節假日的人流感覺都頂不太住了，中午12點退房，下午3點入住，等太久，雖然有寄存服務，但是帶孩子仍不是很方便。擺渡車方便，但是週日的擺渡車明顯很擠，週一的就好很多，建議想想解決方案呀。
5，大堂挺大，等入住的時候居然不讓睡覺，什麼神仙規定，有點逗了。專門安排個人看你睡着就叫醒。
總體阿那亞社區不錯，各種食堂和餐廳沒有太大的坑，租借的自行車也很舒服，但是酒店沒有太多的驚艷，中規中矩，不過人員的服務態度不錯，一些細節還需要繼續提升。

辦理入住、打電話叫接駁車等等流程都太複雜了，每次坐車都要打電話，有些流程真的需要嗎？問你在哪她記錄，問你姓名她記錄，問你房間號她記錄，問你電話她記錄，然後她還要再向你重複一遍上面她問過的所有問題反覆確認你説的對不對她記的對不對，從你打電話到車來接你，一個世紀過去了。最後等你終於坐上了車，你會發現有很多人沒打電話依然能上車，而且他們根本不知道需要打電話，一個酒店服務項還有訊息差你説説。

1）等待辦理入住人非常多，當時我感冒身體非常不舒服。前台小妹看到這情況，立即聯繫經理幫忙本人優先辦理入住。
2）退房時我不小心將2件衣服遺留在房間，立即聯繫我將衣服快遞給我。
3）還有看我們愛喝咖啡，服務員第二天留張紙條，説我們愛喝咖啡就多放了2包給我們，心裏非常温暖。非常貼心！
我們肯定會帶家人來度假再次入住這家酒店。（圖片在手機裏沒辦法加上，抱歉！）

現在住完了 如果下次還需要選 我大概率會選安瀾 服務什麼都很好 從住進去那一刻就感覺所有的服務人員都很熱情開朗 感覺就很好 出行當天還接到了阿那亞的管家電話 一切都很貼心
唯一一點是 10號早上七樓電梯壞了 然後也沒提前通知或者在七樓有人指引一下 搞得我們看日出的人像無頭蒼蠅一樣到處找人問怎麼下樓在五點多的時候 但是看完日出回來電梯就修好了 也挺棒的
最後我們離開去隱廬了 禮賓還很貼心的幫我們拿行李 但是下次來肯定不會糾結選擇了 就選安瀾！
紅棗茶真的不錯喲

提個意見，早餐排隊體驗很差，孕婦特意錯峯吃飯，每次都等位10桌以上。酒店早餐排隊，從未見到過。這個是最大的敗筆。

房間沒有門鈴，不大方便

整個入住期間的每一位工作人員都超級nice，無論何時何地見到你都會面帶微笑的打招呼！然後麻煩給我們換被子的工作人員還超貼心的留了小卡片！
四天三晚的體驗真的過於完美，帶着兩個推輪椅的長者本以為會有諸多不便，但在他們的幫助下真的讓我們擁有了一個完美的假期！

msg:九月底的阿那亞行程中3晚都安瀾度過，見證了十一期間人流由少 → 爆的全過程。
	
🙊亮點：
✅阿那亞南區核心位置。第三食堂、籃球場、網球場就在旁邊，離文創街很近，海邊集市走路就2-3分鐘，雖然離海邊有點距離，但會清凈很多
	
✅房間感覺有5-60平，落塵區、小客廳、就寢區佈局合理且都很寬敞。由於是一層的房間，還有一個寬大的露台。整體以黑白灰-木色搭配，簡約有格調
	
✅整套洗浴用品是lokadhatu這個牌子，沒聽説過但確實很好用
	
✅冰箱飲品免費、礦泉水房間準備很多、大廳免費的紅棗水和酸梅汁好喝
	
✅客人休息空間超大，服務人員響應速度快，都會主動打招呼、提供幫助，即使客人多的時候也能安排的開
	
🙈不足：
🚫攜X直接預訂，單獨+雙早￥98/人感覺不值，所以定了無早餐房
	
🚫提前2-3天和我電話確認行程、登記車牌號。登記之後車輛直接抬桿入園。但攜X的工作人員並沒有介紹入園注意事項，起碼告知下載app、認證以及車輛出入的要求
	
🚫酒店地下停車位稍有些侷促，地上停車場車位很大
	
⚠️注意：
❗️京秦完全不堵，從東四環出發全程不到4個小時，但貌似衹有一頭一尾的2個服務區可以加油
	
❗️問了前台：車輛衹能進出一次，進來後車輛就衹能停着不能動了，剩下就靠園區巴士或其他了。地下停車場牆上有電話可以讓酒店擺渡車來接駁
	
❗️提前下載阿那亞app實名認證就可以激活“身份碼”，這樣就可以到各食堂，感覺更划算

安瀾是我住過所有酒店中服務最好的，曾經認為海底撈的服務夠牛掰的，現在覺得安瀾比海底撈更好。
我們管家小姐姐這種細緻入微的服務，簡直是每天都在給我驚喜，貼心的給小朋友準備禮物，每天噓寒問暖，有求必應。服務好到讓我有點心疼這樣的姑娘。在我們有兩位男士的情況下，竟然要主動幫我們拿行李。有點想和酒店提提意見，以後這樣的體力活不能要求女孩子管家來做了，工作已經很認真很辛苦了，提拿重物應該留給紳士來做！
這幾天每天都在説謝謝，真心的謝謝曉恬姑娘，謝謝安瀾酒店的服務。

msg:我真的可太愛安瀾了！本來和朋友衹打算住一晚，結果就是酒店的服務，所以決定多住一晚，哪怕因為中秋房價上漲也值得！
先説服務：從到達開車門問候開始，雖然入住時間比較晚，但行李存放沒有讓我們多等，工作人員眼疾手快，出去玩完回來入住時看我們拿東西貼心將行李送到房門口，房間乾淨衞生，礦泉水跟不要錢一樣狂補，還有零食！我要問問那個黑胡椒薯片是什麼牌子啊！太好吃了！回來心心念念！還有大廳的紅棗茶！看日出的早上來一杯太舒服了！請告訴我配方！早餐很豐富。
再説設計：我很喜歡酒店的簡約，整體應該像一個樹杈一樣分叉，所以採光都很好，另外班車也沒有別人説的那麼少，至少我全程沒有等超過三分鐘，班車小哥的服務也很貼心，會問去哪裡就近下車，而且雖然不靠近海，但是到哪裡都很方便，總之在一個旅遊高峯期，我住得很開心，所以第一次來寫這麼多評價，下次阿那亞再見

1.有蒼蠅先入住，客服連個電蚊拍都沒有，也不幫着打。晚上奮戰幾個小時終於用社區地圖打死了，還好入住時候拿了兩個地圖要不真打不死了。（看圖有蒼蠅品種細圖，文化程度不夠，認不出來）；
2.承諾的晚入住優惠券不兑現，不在乎錢可沒信譽忍不了；
3.大廳行李寄存處工作人員詢問問題一開始愛搭不理，問多了翻白眼；
4.酒店地下停車場需要走200米左右才能到大廳，無電梯能到大廳。大家多提幾個行李可以一起來健身。對了，地下停車場樓梯要轉六個平台才能走上來，還可以練習腿部肌肉，十字韌帶，這點喜愛健身的我給好評，就是地下樓梯能通風就好了；
5.開車入住酒店不讓開出酒店，社區內不讓開自己的車，開出去罰款（酒店前台強調的，車牌沒限號）；不知道哪位律師朋友能幫着確認一下，為啥開車入住酒店不能開出去，另外罰款怎麼來的。從沒出過國，不知道其他國家那個州有這條法規。作為中國人很不適應外國法律（小鎮自行車按金一千元）；
6.酒店電動接送車拖延深夜路邊半個小時罰站，晚上打電話給酒店在售樓處想坐酒店電動車回去，先説15分鐘，30分鐘才到。在寒冷酷酷的社區燈光下面罰站思考自己做錯了啥。
7.早餐麪醬裏有鋼絲球（見下圖），一瞬間更窒息了。還挺長一根，差點兒和食道或者氣管親密接觸，在這個沒有醫院的社區後背發涼。
窒息到寫不下去，以上食品衞生問題均有照片和錄像。非説自備活蒼蠅和鋼絲球的，估計不是國人的習慣。

msg:入住當天是極度不開心的，正對着入口處的前台，男服務生語氣温柔，態度敷衍冷淡。我是攜帶母親出遊，訂了大床想問下有沒有雙床，正常前台會幫忙調整房間因為價格是相同的，並且已經開學又不是週末，酒店內空房間一定很多。服務員拒絕了我，説滿房了。（騙人，當時酒店訂房頁面雙床還可以預訂）並且！給我安排了一間走廊盡頭的三樓房間，緊挨着隔壁逃生通道。樓梯間一直有人上下樓，隔音非常差，極度影響休息。非常難忘的人生經歷。

並且入住時候，前台另一位女服務員悉心向她的客人介紹酒店設施，還簽了一張什麼協議。這位前台大哥屁都沒介紹，我也沒看到什麼協議。非常氣憤的一次旅行！！感覺被歧視了，可能因為我們看起來是貧窮土氣的窮遊母女吧。這男的我忘記他叫什麼名字了，反正真是不行，我去過那麼多國家住過那麼多酒店，用了攜程十幾年，第一次遇到這麼傲慢的前台。

經歷了地獄般的一夜，轉天美麗又貼心的小才妹妹主動聯繫我幫我換了房間，聽説我沒休息好，還送來了泡腳的東西希望我們能緩解疲勞。服務三星是前台0星，小才超五星。平均三星。希望我的評價不要影響到這位漂亮小姑娘，她真的特別好！！前台這男的，真的氣**。

酒店本身沒毛病，早餐好吃，位置好，接駁車方便，設施也很新。沐浴用品洗手液都巨巨巨好聞，又好用。阿那亞確實是個好地方。

環境：酒店非常大，而且門特別多，大家要注意每個門通的地方不一樣，有廣場、室內泳池等等，要問清楚，裝修風格水泥風，漂亮～

服務：重點説一下服務，簡直是我去過的所有酒店裡最好最好的一家，簡直是不計成本的服務，首先是大廳經理“常玥彪”貼心的留下聯絡方式，“任何問題直接找我”，我連個去超市買東西我都問他哪裡有，吃喝拉撒我都問他，非常耐心並解決問題，而且不索要任何回報，並告訴我下次來還給安排；酒店所有工作人員見面都是微笑説你好，非常親切，都在用心服務，我這次非常感動

最後，攜程的增值服務非常給力，堪比小管家，幫助協調所有需求並落實

大家第一次來阿那亞一定要住在安瀾啊！！！

服務：服務態度非常好，因為有空房間還提前安排了入住。訂的房間是包含自助早餐的雙床房，還有兩杯大廳飲品券，可以選奶茶或者現磨咖啡什麼的。大廳雖然不是那麼豪華，但是很文藝舒適，像咖啡廳。
房間格局就非常喜歡啦，室內沒有多餘牆面，客廳沙發和卧室用軟隔斷（白紗簾）間隔，門口準備的小零食隨便吃，不夠可續（就是每次給拿的很少）。門口的小吧枱也非常喜歡，吃吃零食喝喝小酒賊有情調。
房間裏有地暖，比空調風舒適不乾燥。枕頭和床軟硬適中，枕頭不舒服還可以聯繫酒店換。房間帶個外露台事業也不錯，整體非常滿意。
自助早餐推薦Q：大蝦蒸餃、黑椒牛肉粒。其它比較常不難吃。
性價比挺高。

服務確實很好…從前台到餐廳、客房都非常熱情，禮貌。
但是這個房間雖然大，但很多小蟲子，沒有開陽台門哦…衞生間太小了，和房間整體不成比例，1500的房間，感覺卻是民宿的硬件配套。
房間裏小酒吧的零食和飲品比較豐富，也可以隨意添加，知道老公要抽煙，也送來了煙缸，雖然沒配塑料拖鞋，打電話也送過來了。
來酒店前是攜程聯繫的我們，詢問是不是可以晚點兒辦理入住，我才順便要了酒店的電話去諮詢自駕車輛的問題，因為阿那亞這塊管理很嚴，但酒店並沒有提前來電來詢問和主動幫助我們做車輛登記，如果我們自己過去，在門口就會被工作人員攔住進不去。
酒店人太多，總體管理還是不錯，周邊很方便，離3食堂很近，小鎮廣場走5分鐘，應該是比較中心的位置，雖然不面海，但環境很不錯。早餐也還是不錯，但可以不選擇含早餐，周圍吃的很多，烘焙店也多。有來有小的可以含早，不用折騰…

通過柴女士這一轉危為安的處理，反應酒店管理非常到位！下次再來安瀾絕對是第一選擇！而且會向朋友以此故事推薦！
而且酒店的位置雖不在海邊，但是地處社區核心，酒店提供24小時海邊接送，所以觀景和遊覽可以兩全其美。

周到的前台服務，好喝的免費茶飲，優越的地理位置，有品的房間設施。

下次再去阿那亞，還住安瀾酒店🏨

首先服務員不論是大堂還是樓層服務服務員很熱情，會主動打招呼！房間很乾凈，還貼心寫上小提示。
飲用水管夠，不設限，冰箱的飲料也很齊，而且可以續，小零食也很好，會主動問喜歡什麼可以添

酒店的接駁車很方便，到任何一個景點都很近，臨時有需要還可以電話聯繫在指定地點接上。
早餐中規中矩，環境好，按位排號放入，不擁擠，翻枱速度也可以
很好的體驗，下次應該還會選擇

首先 下午辦理入住的客人雖然很多 但是前台的服務人員依然耐心解答 並儘可能滿足你提出的一些小願望
管家會把你的行李拉到房間 並在你入住時間服務
房間裏有免費的小零食 小冰箱裏有幾種免費的不同的飲料 
我們入住當天孩子發燒了 管家聯繫前台拿的體温計 服務枱還專門跑到保健站給孩子買的葯品 並且不收費
管家也一直詢問孩子的病情 並且在退房時給做了延時
真的 推開房間門的時候就覺得衞生很好 環境愜意
後來又覺得勝在服務 
酒店的接駁車會在任何時候 社區的任何地方接送你 
走廊裏遇見的每個服務員都會微笑着説你好
離店的時候我們的管家還把我們送上了車 
總之 覺得阿那亞社區走的是文藝範兒的路 是一個隨手一拍都出片的小鎮 就像現實裏的一幅幅畫
阿那亞的安瀾酒店會在下一次好想來的時候毫不猶豫的選擇

以前來會選擇clubmed，這次是和朋友一起來的，朋友聊起來也説下一次還會選擇入住安瀾。我個人也認為安瀾會是最好的選擇，優點太多了不一一列數，還是有點點小建議希望能採納：1. 套房也衹能報一個車牌號接送入園，這個不合理，這裏根本打不到7座專車。衹能兩輛出租，但按照你們的要求我們被迫選擇園區下車再搭酒店接駁車，大人好説，但對行動不便的長者和嬰兒太不友好了。2. 早餐的餐廳太小了，每天都有人等位進入。

PS：早餐我選擇了外送，使用阿那亞APP外賣了食堂早點，送到酒店大廳，自取，很方便。酒店周圍配備小童遊樂設施，跳床一類，小朋友很喜歡。周邊的飲食也很豐富

不過還是想吐槽一點，最後讓我不舒服的那1%就是樓道里有幾個服務員在打掃房間，一位正好打開車上蓋簾放東西，而我則恰好走到旁邊，房間門口另一位服務員就跟防賊一樣，迅速搶着把補充食物的車蓋簾蓋上，滿臉戒備😓其實我覺得真的沒有必要吧……本是補給，如果客户張口你們一樣會給進行補充，所以大可不必怕我看到那車上東西😂當然，這不影響我對酒店整體評價。

到達酒店後，有服務人員代客泊車（住宿期間車不能再開出來），酒店的接駁車隨叫隨到，接送全管；
房間不大，主打一個細節周到：枕頭、拖鞋各種形號可選，洗漱用具大人孩子的也是全套，飲料、水、零食無限續，贈送的掛耳咖啡一定不要錯過，超級香！
安瀾離海邊不是最近的，但其實整個阿那亞也不大。看日出可以提前預訂接駁車。缺點也有幾個：泳池衹有室外的，孩子玩還行，比較小；馬桶圈沒有緩沖震耳欲聾；衞生可以打掃的再乾淨一點，死角有點多。樓層服務員姜曉波非常周到貼心，手動五星點贊👍

還有就是每次打電話叫接駁車都要把訊息問一遍。其它方面就是中規中矩

硬件方面，早餐時段明顯可以看到住客基本都是年輕人，但是咖啡機衹有一台且運行速度很慢，整個用餐期間咖啡機區域一直在排隊。
建議：酒店應該加強內部管理，提高專業度，對於住客的合理需求，及時響應並疏通酒店內部的溝通渠道。

msg:選擇安瀾是阿那亞之行的亮點，酒店的服務是近些年來入住酒店中體驗最好的，代客泊車就不説了 東西落在車裡 會有禮賓員去車裡找到後送到房間，因為下午到店時房間還沒打掃好 入住後工作人員特地打電話來表示歉意，詢問入住感受。另外 詢問賓客中心最近的超市在哪裡，工作人員講解了超市位置以後，還熱心詢問是不是需要他們去代買東西 我驚呆了，總之安瀾酒店在入住期間可以説是有求必應，對得起它的價格

一、優點：
1.有接駁車，園區內到各個地方比較方便；
2.有陽台和室外晾衣架；
3.小童户外遊樂設施比較豐富；
4.離第三食堂比較近。
二、缺點
1.服務效率太慢，叫服務後經常等2個小時以上才響應；
2.洗衣機不乾淨或者是清洗衣物不乾淨，而且用之前送臟衣服的袋子把洗好的衣服送回來（圖為裝臟衣服的袋子，發現洗完衣服送回的還是這個袋子），衣物洗完一股臭味；
3.明明有烘乾機，客服一開始卻欺騙説沒有；
4.房間沒有配備浴缸，衹有簡單的淋浴設施；
5.沒有每天補足水、零食和飲品，需要提示客服才能送過來；
6.電視有問題，看半個小時以上就卡頓或死機。

住店期間在外面玩，下起了大雨，酒店有專人打電話問候提醒帶傘，得知沒拿傘的情況下，安排了酒店接駁車來接的我們！雖然酒店本身有這個服務，但是還是非常讓人感動 ！酒店香氛非常好，熱心前台給了我香氛的購買方式 非常感謝！

還有大廳沙發邊的一些小綠植多肉們都好好看，養的也很棒，本來想拍照的，一瞬間手機沒電了

服務：不論是大廳服務的小夥子還是電話客服或是小汽車司機、客房小姐姐，都很熱情，見面就打招呼，孩子去找姐姐要一些零食或是創口貼紙巾之類的，也都是各種滿足需求～讓我們感到出行很舒服也很愉快，謝謝🙏

設施：唯一美中不足的是沒有食堂，需要到處覓食。勝在酒店位置不錯，隨便溜達幾分鐘就能到達那幾個食堂，附近也有一些網紅餐廳，都不遠，即便遠，小車子也都能車接車送的把我們送到指定地點～
酒店門口的遊樂場也是孩子們愛的地方，烈日炎炎也擋不住孩子們的熱情，幸好有酸梅湯解暑🤭

總之，這次出行很滿意，很開心，有機會會再來的。謝謝安瀾給出行的心情添分～

服務不錯但是也沒有到超好的地步就正常吧。

msg:3月份住過兩晚，這次衹住了一晚但體驗感差了很多。第一次入住時候送了電影票，所以來之前想規劃一下行程就也提前問了一下，得到的回答是現在的電影票都是在套餐裏的，唯一能夠贈送的是4:00以後入住的晚住禮遇是兩張理想國的咖啡劵。
入住當天是陰天很冷想按時入住，所以15:28打電話給前台問房間是否收拾好了，能否入住得到的回答是還沒有準備好，準備好以後會打電話給我。15:56收到電話通知才説準備好了。也就是説，如果3:00多到達前台，需要等一個小時才能入住。這讓我覺得很不開心。我4:00多到達前台辦理入住的時候，發現前台沒有給我晚住禮遇的咖啡券就問了一下，又被告知這現在已經活動停止了，我説昨天已經告訴我了，雖然最後給我拿了兩張感覺挺不情願的。
我的想法是如果沒有咖啡券的活動為什麼要告知？是不是團隊內沒有同步清楚？還是不想給？享受晚住禮遇可以是我的選擇但不是我被強迫，如果三點到了那是不是意味着我要在大廳浪費時間等房間？能不能提前告知我而不是等我去問？

園區內出行可以聯繫酒店的擺渡車，24小時提供服務，但是住店客人比較多，一般需要等待20分鐘左右。
酒店服務方面，稍微有些失望，沒有感覺像小紅書上面宣傳的那麼好，尤其是辦理入住的時候，看到工作人員跟前面的客人介紹的很全，説了很久，但是到我這，很簡單的兩三句，稍顯急躁，很多事情都是我自己問才告訴的，而且網上説晚上九點之後辦理入住有食堂代金券或者電影票等，我入住的時候都沒有。不過酒店門口幫忙拿行李和安排擺渡車的工作人員都是很負責熱情的，點贊點贊👍

總體感受還不錯，自助早餐也豐富，但人多時候可能要等位。
酒店位置離海邊及景點較遠，但有免費接駁車，景點玩完給酒店打電話告訴在哪個站點留好電話，司機到了會聯繫在哪兒上車。酒店邊上有個第三食堂，不想去遠處吃飯可以食堂解決，住宿的訪客通過阿那亞app憑身份碼就可以買飯啦。

msg:酒店服務五顆星，在國內旅遊來説算是服務非常好的了。服務員見面會主動打招呼，推車進電梯會主動詢問是否能同乘。大廳的紅棗湯非常喜歡，每次路過大廳都要喝一杯。房間的水和零食可以無限續，這點也很給力。帶孩子準備了床圍欄，很周到。生日準備了蛋糕和簡單佈置，非常貼心。唯一美中不足的是酒店離海邊有點兒遠，需要步行十多分鐘，坐擺渡車等車十多分鐘，擺渡車少，等的時間長，其實和走着差不多，這點不太便捷。
