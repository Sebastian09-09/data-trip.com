msg:The hotel is a little dated and you can tell it used to be nice and modern. The rooms could use an update or a little “zhuzh”though. The amenities are good and the grounds are well kept. The staff is also amazing and were helpful whenever I had problems. I do get you’re paying for the Marriott brand but compared to other Marriott owned hotels, this hotel is just ok. A bit underwhelming and overpriced. Breakfast was good with a variety of options from Western to Chinese. The restaurant also had tasty, flavourful food I tried for dinner. Big up to this . I was upgraded to the pool access room which was nice, I had escaped cold Shanghai for a warmer place, ended up not swimming because the pool was a little cold. Wish it was heated( maybe the kiddy pool was). Sanya was unfortunately gloomy and cold so didn’t get a chance to enjoy the ocean. Overall the stay was just okay. Nice if you want easy access to a beach you can actually swim in.

Further, we liked the location, its closeness to the beach, as well to a food court, about 200 meters away where we found a few local restaurants, besides two restaurants inside the hotel. We found the inside hotel fruit shop also wonderful. 
The breakfast is really decent. We were touched by a staff‘s considerate note (when she noticed some medicines on our side table). Overall we liked a lot this place and hope to come back to it in the future.

Unfortunately we had to leave earlier due to a change of schedule. The manager was really concerned about our situation. He helped us in all the step and agreed to make a refund of our stay. When we left he called us because we forgot clothes in the closet of our room. He's currently doing everything to send it back to France. 
Next time we'll come back to this island we'll go directly to the Sheraton to enjoy the days we lost the first time.

The pools were a bit chilly for that time time of year but still enjoyable for a few hours. The beach access form the hotel is so convenient. The beach is clean with many recliners available. 

Herry got the chef to make me a veggie omelet at breakfast for me which I really appreciated. The dinner buffet wasn’t really to our liking as a lot of the options were pork which I don’t eat and it was quite limited for the price, in my opinion. We did enjoy dinner buffets around that area  though. 

Wonderful stay all in all. Will definitely return

Can swim in the sea. Beachbeds were hard to get always occupied. Tip: go take a stroll to neighboring Marriott. They have much more (and better) beds. For dinner not too much options in the hotel. Not much atmosphere for the places opened for dinner. Tip: again go to Marriott there is a nice small beach restaurant some easy foods and drinks. There is also a cluster of restaurants on walking distance but that was soso lets say shopping mall experience. Breakfast ok have enough to choose. Area to sit bit small therefore feels very busy. Overall very comfortable stay here!

The cold water given away during a hot humid day while people are waiting in line to check in was also nice. The room was clean but the carpet in the hallway has a musty smell even with the air purifier on. The carpet needs deep cleaning or replaced. It was a wonderful 5 nights stay for us there. It's definitely worth the money with all it has to offer. Breakfast buffet had a lot of choices for Westerners as well. Overall, the facilities in this hotel is well - maintained though it's showing its age. Landscape is beautiful and it's so clean walking around, lots of swimming pools for children and adults to choose from, fun kids play area, helpful, proactive, and courteous staff. There's also a small shop to buy snacks by the kids play area. We also love the dinner buffet by the sea with the live band; both the male and female vocalists had good voices. Again, dinner buffet was fantastic! We had it during my birthday. We came back to our room and was surprised by a birthday cake. It shows how they pay attention to little details like this to make our stay great. The food served by the pool was also good though it took a bit long to arrive. What else can I say? This hotel is a great deal!

The negatives for me were the ridiculous food prices - 160 yuan for a pasta, prices almost double shanghai. Unfortunately there are also not many food options in Yalong bay except the generic chains like KFC, McDonalds so you have to get used to eating local food. If you’re a foreigner I suggest you bring some snacks with. 

The bar also don’t know how to make many cocktails. If you’re looking for good drinks then head to a bar in Dadonghai

It's true, the rooms and some facilities need some repairing & maintenance; however it has great swimming pools, and especially for kids. Breakfast buffet has several Western choices. The restaurant has a section for children, which we found very convenient too!  There's a pool bar in one of the swimming pools, that  sells drinks and food (Sheraton prices). Dinner buffet is good, although we went more to Marriott's (next door), as this one has more options for no seafood eaters -like us. 
Beach location is very convenient, and lifeguards are keen to help you get water, towels and help you book water sports / games.
The rest of hotel staff is very attentive, though some don't speak a word of English. The ladies at the playroom were very sweet towards our daughters. 
I would recommend this hotel to others, and would definitely come back here in the future!

msg:The hotel is in a prime location and has a beautiful location. But unfortunately that’s were it stops. The hotel feels tired and the room was out of date. The air con constantly needed to be fixed and never was adequately. It was hot and made sleeping without a blanket a necessity. The service is substandard for a 5 star hotel. The food service would be similar to a local restaurant where the food is just placed wherever on the table and not individually in front of the patron. The table isn’t cleaned off and there is little care shown by the servers in checking on if we are happy and if we need anything.  Most servers cannot speak even basic English and makes it necessary to use translation apps. Which makes it a challenge. Clearly they need better training for all guests that stay at the hotel. For the price paid for the room, it isn’t worth it. The outdoor facilities are pleasant but service is poor throughout the hotel and it isn’t international at all. Furthermore, the beach is going through a major land reclamation with heavy machinery on the beach and huge ships dumping massive amounts of sand piles everywhere. So not only does it sound like a construction site all throughout the day and even late into the night, the beach is unpleasant. You might want to ask the condition of the beach in front of the hotel before you book, otherwise you might be very disappointed.  The front desk never informed me that it was a construction site when I booked and they clearly should have. Literally and figuratively put their heads in the sand and hoped for the best.

The gym was outdated and had old, rusted and torn equipment, and I only encountered maybe 3 people, with great service, that could speak English.   Overall the stay was OK.

msg:Great hotel. While it is not the newest hotel, the garden is mature, the pools cater for every age and the grounds and buildings are very well cared for. The staff is very friendly and even when they are not very comfortable speaking English, they will find someone who can help. The cleaning staff works hard and are very friendly. I feel bad for the staff at reception as they are in a hot corner but still they smile.
The one low point is the food. For the breakfast for example, you have variety but I find that the ingredients are of low quality, and there is little to no change every day. The buffet that they offer every night with Seaview is fine but overpriced for the selection and quality; also, the possibility of passing showers is something they should cater. We did not mind but it rained while we were eating (a few minutes shower) but they had nothing to cover the food or to offer the guests (who were mostly hiding under flimsy palm trees). We all had a good laugh and enjoyed our time but they should be better prepared. We found an amazing buffet for half the price in a neighbouring 5-star hotel and the only difference was that it is indoors and has not view of the ocean. There are cheaper options close by to eat local or 'international' (Korean - Thai) and you are allowed to have food delivered at the hotel. There is a small shop and the sales person is very friendly. The snacks are limited and not to everyone's taste but if you don't mind a little walk, you can buy your favourite snacks in a supermarket not far away.
Half the  beach was 'under-construction' when we stayed but for the last few days we had access to the other half as well. I have to say that from our walks on the beach, we have observed that the hotel has the best stretch of beach at the moment with the "construction" moving up in stride (they are re-building the beach to counter erosion - lots of cranes)
If you are looking to swim, use the pools. The beach is fine but you can only stand in the ocean and get slapped by the waves. It is warm though.. you will find that the "no-swimming" flag is always up.

If you do you will need the pay again when you arrive + deposit. And trip will return the money after check out. So be aware not to choose this option. I really don't know why they offer this.

There is a 25m swimming pool for training , a pool for toddlers with slides and playground, a jacuzzi for approximately 10 or more people, another swimming pool with basketball frame, beach access, table tennis for free at the gym, gym 24 hours. 

Breakfast is abundant and made me skip lunch with the huge variety.

Housekeepers are very polite and friendly , all staff are super well trained , the hotel atmosphere is so much fun even though it rained everyday, I could still enjoy every single moment at the hotel . 

Thanks so much for the great stay, and I am looking forward to stay again soon. 

The price was a great deal and I would love to come back for staying a week there . 

I would even consider working for Sheraton Sanya Yalongbay if an opportunity comes out .

I went from a regular room to the Presidental suite to a Private Villa! Annie and the GM (White German guy) went above and beyond to ensure I had a fantastic four days at the Sheraton. 

The hotel is a beachfront hotel. You can walk from your hotel directly onto the beach! 
My Villa was perfect! I had so much space all to myself.ahhh! It was perfect! 
The BBQ dinner on the beach was an excellent ending to a long day.  So many choices for food. There was something for everyone. Personally, I enjoyed the grilled oysters. The breakfast was delicious as well. 
Overall, I appreciate the great customer service by the staff. They went above and beyond to make sure I was happy! Matter of fact, the German GM was walking along the hot beach asking each guest if they were okay and if they needed anything. I thought that was amazing! Here are some random pics of my trip! Enjoy❤️

msg:Well located hotel with wonderful pools and beach. Breakfast is good, service is helpful. Restaurants prices are a bit on the high side but room service is quite at same level.
Decoration is a bit old and humidity in the air. Would have loved an introduction of the hotel at checkin.
Also pools and beach only open at 9am and close early 9pm.

Breakfast was really good. 
The services are OK. it was a little difficult to communicate while checking as we don't speak Chinese language. 
also we wanted to do late check out but they couldn't help much. and we wanted to take a before going to the airport but as we checked out  we couldn't do that. so surprise to see that no shower facilities after checking out (specially when its a chain hotel)

msg:Our family wanted to spend relaxing holiday with appropriate service on the beautiful seaside for reasonable price - considering high season at the time. And this was exactly what this hotel fulfilled, completely achieved our expectation! The hotel is directly on beautiful beach with turquoise water and pleasant sand, one of the few places where you can swim on Hainan, even it's in the defined small area. Directly in the hotel, you can find more swimming pools, each of them for different type of leisure and age - shallow for kids, deeper for swimming, pool with a bar, massage springs etc. The hotel itself is a bit older and worn. However it did not have any effect on our comfort. Moreover this was already priced in because this hotel was noticeably cheaper than the hotels around. The rooms are spatious, with pleasant balcony, the beds are comfortable. Cleaning service supplied us with good amount of free water.  The breakfast offers good variety of choice. Hotel staff is helpful and pleasant, especially Mr Derrick was very helpfull with information research. You can contact him for any help in English
For the improvement, I can imagina the hotel needs some renovationn. But that probably also cause the price increase, so better stay as it is:-). Further I suggest free swimming on all the beach belonging to the hotel. In that case, I would definitely come again!

Great variety of pools. Staff was very friendly and supportive. Negative experience was that checkin was only possible at 14:30 -> I know, official check-in time is 15:00 but I have experienced in all hotels so far that I was given a room earlier. Maybe it was fully booked due to high season. Room was a little bit smelly so we left the ventilation on during the whole day.

 kosher food for guest that only eat special meat.  We were limited to seafood ad we were not sure of the meat if it was Halal / kosher or not as it doesn't say anywhere.
We had to go outside a few times to eat .  Hopefully, that something the management should consider.
Thanks for the wonderful stay.

The staff were pleasant and were constantly cleaning up the rooms, hallways, common areas, and beach front. Although the breakfast buffet had a wide range of Chinese cuisine, adding more Western choices would be greatly appreciated.

There are two big pools which are safe for kids to swim/stand in. They have a few daily activities for the kids going on, as well as a soft play area (although they had the TV on which meant the kids were watching more than playing). The access to the beach is great too. The restaurant was reasonably priced too. We would definitely come back again as it is so easy for a comfortable family stay.

There is a large lawn above the beach. The dinner last night was very meaningful. The outdoor dining room is equipped with red wine and food. After a delicious meal, I staggered back to the room.

msg:+ The hotel has magnificent territory. Very beautiful and very green. I would like to commend the work of the people who look after her. They are huge Well done!!!
We walked in other neighboring hotels - ours was the most beautiful 🙂
+ Nice pools. The staff always monitors the cleanliness of the pool and sun loungers.
+ The staff is always ready to help. They can speak English😃 It’s very nice that they checked us in in the morning without any problems, they congratulated my husband on his birthday very nicely😊 I especially want to mention Akim at the reception! It helps resolve all issues with lightning speed and make your vacation carefree 👍
+ BBQ in the evenings - very tasty! A must visit.
+ Great for entertaining kids. They always come up with events for them.
+ view 😍

+/- Breakfast: for the Chinese, breakfast is excellent. For Europeans there is not so much variety. In general, an omelet, fresh watermelon, cheese and 1 type of sausage were enough for me, but I ate like that for all 7 days and was very upset when they decided not to cut my sausage on some days 😅 The latte is delicious. A bit controversial about the cheese, it is very thinly sliced ​​and all wet (melts quickly). I would change something about this 😬but everything is so delicious!

+/- the rooms are clean, without mold, which is not unimportant. BUT! My husband was in this hotel as a child, 20 years ago, and says that since then, only the TVs have changed😃 the rooms require updating in the future. The furniture is already very old.

+/- showers, like showers, at the exit from the beach do not work. Switches are broken. You can only wash your feet, but there is a sign asking you to take a shower after the sea 😃

+/- because of the rain, the mattresses on the sun loungers are always wet and dirty. It would be better if they were leather, not rag, then they wouldn’t get so wet and they could be easily wiped.

3 huge disadvantages:
- WiFi performance is terrible. It was impossible to work. Sometimes it knocked out, sometimes it didn’t pull. He lives his own life. WiFi needs to be strengthened.
- Gym: again, the exercise equipment has not changed at all in 20 years. And besides, half of them are broken. 2 out of 3 tracks are not working. It is not normal. The hall is already small, and also broken. There are many new modern exercise equipment, the gym needs updating.
- AND THE BIGGEST MINUS! I think management needs to pay attention to this. STAFF WORK ON THE BEACH. Besides the fact that they periodically shout into their megaphones for show and sit on their phones all day, they do NOTHING else. The beach is dirty. Cigarettes are in the sand and coconuts are scattered everywhere. The sunbeds are dirty. Everything is covered in sand, mattresses turned upside down after the rain and wind, lying behind. In the morning, no one straightens them after the rain. All the time they are occupied with towels, which 90% of people do not take with them after leaving the beach. We came for the sea, but we felt like we were on a public beach, it was very dirty😔 and compared to the beauty of the whole area, the landing behind the sunbeds was not well-groomed at all.

To summarize: the hotel is cool, the location is cool, the vacation was wonderful. There will be nothing to correct or complain about some points! Will be the best hotel in Sanya! We will definitely come again and check out the gym and the beach😃

After I consulted the duty manager Allen (whose temperament and conversation were very much like the principal, which made me think I came to the Party School for study), he and I added WeChat, and I consulted him for any questions. All the staff provided good service. The lady in the restaurant (sorry, I really want to thank her but didn't have time to take a photo of her beauty) was efficient and meticulous, and very considerate. The Ambassador Suite has a super long balcony and a large bathtub, and the sea view is better than Haitang Bay. Thank you Allen for the coconut shell necklace specially prepared for the children, and I sent it to them with this blessing.
It would be better if the shampoo products were upgraded, because long hair is frizzy after washing.
It would be better if the clothes hanger was upgraded, because many of the ones with clips are broken. In addition, I would like to talk about my experience. I used such a hanger in Beihai Furama before. After drying for a night, the shoulders of the white T-shirt were dyed yellow by the hanger, so Sheraton can refer to it.
It would be good if the hot water for bathing was stable and would not get cold intermittently.

msg:Last year, I stayed in a pool room. My kids had a great experience and I never forgot it. This year, I booked a four-day Sheraton pool room for my Sanya trip. When I checked in, the pool water in the room was a little turbid for some reason (I saw it later and it seemed to be fine again). Therefore, the hotel upgraded the pool suite to a pool suite in the same area as the pool room. The end room was made into a suite with an independent pool. The pool was 1.2 meters deep and had a good sense of privacy, which was suitable for families with babies. Big babies still like the big pool and can make friends with children from all over the country, haha.
The room is very large, with a living room and a dining area. It is very comfortable to use. Because the room is large, the air conditioning temperature cannot be lowered, and it is a bit hot at night. Probably in the rainy season, the humidity is too high, and the room is a little musty. I asked for a dehumidifier and an electric fan, which can alleviate a lot.
The Yalong Bay Hotel is a bit old, but the service of the old hotel is still up to par. Buckwheat pillows can be provided, and the daily cleaning is careful and meticulous. The floor is barefoot and the soles of the feet will not get dirty. The waiter is quiet and the service is timely. The pool lifeguard is kind and enthusiastic.
There are many choices for outdoor swimming pools. The design of the outdoor landscape is good. It is beautiful to lie by the swimming pool and look at the sea on a sunny day.

msg:Although the hardware of the Sheraton room is a bit old, the foundation of the old luxury hotel is still there. The design of the hotel, especially the lobby, public areas, central lawn and swimming pool, etc., is exquisite and stylish. The price in the off-season in June is also very attractive.
The room is very spacious, and the view of the 6th floor deluxe sea view room is acceptable. The breakfast variety is rich and the taste is also OK. Yaochi Western Restaurant is built by the water, and the dining experience is unique.
There are not many parent-child activities, but they are enough. The small train goes around the park to bring unlimited joy to the children. The slide in the children's swimming pool is also enough for children. However, it needs to be criticized that the swimming ring is not provided free of charge. In addition, because it is not the main parent-child, there are not so many children. Overall, it is relatively quiet and comfortable.
The hotel service is also quite thoughtful. The service staff who clean the room saw that there were children staying and specially folded a little rabbit to send to the children. I felt the attentiveness. I will consider staying at Sheraton next time I come to Yalong Bay.

The weather has been good these days, and it is worth the trip. The room facilities are of five-star hotel standards, clean, tidy and spacious, with sufficient bottled drinking water. The room service staff and restaurant service staff are friendly and professional. The breakfast is rich, with more fruits, a combination of Chinese and Western food, suitable for a variety of appetites. Marriott members can enjoy a 10% discount on lunch and dinner, and a 10% discount on wine (by the glass) and ice cream in the bar and restaurant. The hotel's large lawn is a popular check-in spot, the hotel garden is also beautiful, and the outdoor activity facilities are complete. I strongly recommend it to friends who come to Sanya for vacation.

There is another row of swimming pools on the beach, and you can see the sea. The swimming pool can help inflate the swimming ring. Whether you bring your own or order takeout, it is more cost-effective than renting. The paddle board is 88 for an hour and 44 for half an hour. The children's playground is very small. There is a low-priced supermarket next to it. The fruit prices are really cheap. There is also a small train to ride. There is a music market every afternoon on the central lawn. There are also rich parent-child activities. Hygiene: The hotel is indeed old, but the hygiene is still good. It is relatively clean and well maintained. It has a retro flavor. The room has a musty smell but it is still tolerable. The only thing I am not satisfied with is that the quilt is a bit damp. Environment: It is not a low-profile version of Mandarin Oriental. Hahahaha Service: It is much better than St. Regis. The waiter will take the initiative to say hello when he sees it. What I want to complain about most is breakfast! There are many types but they are not delicious!

Later, the little brother also found a way to help change the room, so that there was a heavy rain on the first day. We were already in a bad mood, but we became happy when we saw the beautiful view in the room. We took a lot of photos and compared them with other hotels. The garden landscape here is my favorite.

I came here after reading the reviews and thought that there were few people and the service was good. After checking in, it was indeed the case. The service staff at the hotel's parent-child center and swimming pool were very friendly and asked for feedback. The garden train was free. I experienced the hand-woven class to catch crabs, which the children liked. The garden of Sheraton is really good, the beach is relatively clean, and sand digging tools are provided free of charge. It really pays attention to the service experience. The response to various temporary needs and emergencies is relatively timely, which is a plus. I will choose this place next time.

msg:First of all, the hotel environment is great, the garden is beautiful, and the hygiene is not bad, but I will not stay here next time, and I don’t recommend staying here, the cost performance is too low.
1. Check-in is too slow, you have to queue up, arrive at the hotel at 12 o'clock, notify one room at 2:30, and another room is ready at 3:30. The key is to queue up to get the room card, which is very inefficient!
2. The housekeeper did not add WeChat before check-in, but other hotels do. When checking out, they called to ask for good reviews and add WeChat. The attitude of the front desk at check-in was indifferent, without any warm reminders, and they answered one question after another, and they did not upgrade the room during the off-season.
3. There was one less bottle of Coke for the gift. After informing the hotel, they actually asked us if we had used it. This should not be the service standard of a five-star hotel, right?
4. I especially praise the lifeguard brother in the competition swimming pool. He is very nice and taught me how to swim. Another point is that it was my family’s birthday, and the hotel sent a cake. This was a surprise. I gave one more point, but it can’t cover up the fact that the service attitude is generally indifferent.
5. The hotel only has a 1.05-meter swimming pool and a 1.4-1.8-meter deep pool, which is not suitable for novice swimmers or those who are not skilled in swimming. Moreover, the 1.05-meter large pool is closed at 7 pm. I was shocked when I came from Sanya Bay! 
6. The facilities in the room are really a bit shabby. I didn't expect it to be a five-star hotel. It is not even as good as the All Seasons. The view will be blocked by coconut trees on the lower floors. The toiletries are also very low. There is no mosquito repellent liquid. You need to ask for it yourself. The swimming ring needs to be rented at your own expense. Although it is close to the beach, the sand is really co**** and hurts your feet, but the public beach is very fine. It's speechless.

It was very comfortable. I also like the travel photography I cooperated with! I was lucky to have a sunny day for the two nights I stayed. The jelly sea got it. The only thing was that there was only one race in the adult swimming pool. I don’t know if it’s because there are too few people in the off-season.

msg:It is worthy of being an old five-star hotel! The location is superior, the environment is excellent, it is close to Yalong Bay, and next to the hotel swimming pool is the beach, coconut grove and sea, the beach is fine, the sea water is clear, and the hotel has complete facilities. Although the facilities are a bit old due to age, they are better in environment and service, and they have everything they should have. The service attitude is very good. First of all, whether it is when checking in or during the stay, it can give people a feeling of being at home. Every service staff can smile and greet the guests when facing them. Secondly, I would like to especially thank the two little beauties who checked me in and out. They have good attitudes and are proficient in business. There is also a little beauty who can help me solve the problem in time when I can't find my room card. They are really nice. Of course, I would also like to thank every service staff who provided services to me in the hotel. The details reflect the professional quality. The service tenet of Yalong Bay Sheraton Resort is indeed worthy of praise! My trip to Sanya was brought to a successful conclusion by Yalong Bay Sheraton Resort 😁

In comparison, I feel that Sheraton is better. I will probably choose Sheraton again when I come to Sanya next time. By the way, the buffet breakfast here is also very rich and has many varieties.

Of course, Ritz is better. The only thing I am not satisfied with is that the swimming pool in the pool room is not a dedicated one. In fact, it is a guest room on the first floor next to the public swimming pool. The breakfast is quite satisfactory. There are not many people on May Day. I am satisfied as long as the children like it.

msg:The service is great! Every time I need something, I get a timely response.
This time I came to Sanya for my child's birthday. The hotel helped us decorate the birthday room when we checked in, and the child was very happy!
I bought some balloons online, both big and small, and wanted to take pictures for my child. I didn't expect it to be so difficult to hit the big balloons and tie the balloons. Our family of three struggled for more than half an hour without success! So I asked for help from the hotel. The staff of the children's park were very, very helpful. Not only did they help me get all the ordinary balloons, but they also accompanied me to the swimming pool and asked the swimming pool staff to help me use the machine to get the big balloons! The swimming pool staff was also very nice. Without saying a word, they found a machine to help me hit the big balloons. But I found that this dark-skinned brother was a little afraid of the balloons if they exploded, but he still helped me hit the balloons big! Thank you very much! After everything was done, the staff of the children's park who accompanied me and tied the balloons helped me take the things together and sent me to the room. It was so thoughtful! If the hotel sees this comment, can you convey my thanks for me!
Summary

In summary, if I remember correctly, this is a five-star hotel, the room is old, there is no service, and the garden is beautiful. The price-performance ratio is not high.

The food at the pool BBQ is good, but the drinks can be improved.

It was around 4:00 in the morning when we arrived, but we still had to pay another $130 to check in and sleep, because we needed to catch up on sleep immediately after the long-distance flight.
Based on staying here for 7 days, if Sheraton didn't charge this $130, the impression would be better

The actual experience exceeded my expectations and lived up to the title of a resort hotel. The hotel's gardens are full of lush vegetation and are very Southeast Asian in style. The swimming pool and large lawn are also highlights. In addition, the most worried about the musty smell in the room was actually not as serious as imagined. Although the hotel facilities are a bit old, they are generally clean and tidy, and the hygiene is good. It can be seen that the management level is very online. The only thing I want to complain about is the fried noodles for breakfast. I don't know if the chef has tried it. It's too salty to swallow, and it's very salty every day. I hope it will improve. Overall, I am very satisfied and recommend Sheraton.

msg:I saw someone recommend this hotel on Xiaohongshu, saying that among all the hotels around, Sheraton is more comfortable, so we chose Sheraton. We chose a sea view room, and when we went there, we were told that the angle was only 30 degrees, so we paid extra to upgrade to a 90-degree sea view room. The view was very beautiful, especially the bougainvillea on the windowsill, which I liked very much. Breakfast and dinner were very delicious, especially the music dinner, where you can eat while watching the sea view and listening to music, which was very comfortable. In addition, the water in the hotel's swimming pool was very good and there was an infinity pool where you could take photos. The overall room was also very comfortable, the bed was very large, the quilt was also very large, there was no obvious musty or damp smell, and I slept very comfortably. It was very quiet after closing the balcony door, and you could see the sea in the distance on the small balcony, which was very beautiful. Although the Internet said that Yalong Bay Sheraton was relatively old, I felt that it was the kind of hotel that had been around for a long time, but it was not old, and the aesthetics were very good and timeless. It is one of the most classic designs and decorations in the hotels we have visited. You really feel very comfortable when you live in it, and everything is just right.

Facilities: All are comprehensive. The beach is within walking distance. Take a walk in the evening and morning and listen to the sound of the waves.

Environment: Clean.

Service:
CON-Bruce staff helped me introduce the hotel facilities, including information on marine activities, and helped me find my mother's lost items and keep them. I went to pick them up the next day. Thank you very much.

I would recommend Sheraton Hotel!

1. The check-in at the front desk was very troublesome. I asked Ctrip to note the room type requirements in advance, but when I arrived at the hotel, the front desk insisted that if the rooms were full, they would not be accommodated. I had no choice but to ask Ctrip to coordinate. Something strange happened. I needed Room types are available again!
2. The hotel is old, and the air conditioner in the room is old and noisy. The key is that the cooling effect is quite poor. I called the engineering depar**ent to repair it twice but couldn't fix it. Later, I asked several guests in other rooms, It is said that air conditioning is very poor. The hot weather in Sanya is really uncomfortable!
3. Breakfast is also very poor, with few varieties and poor taste!
4. The most terrifying thing is that my child and I were woken up by bug bites early in the morning. We were bitten by unknown poisonous bugs in the room. We were so painful and itchy that some of them were infected later. We couldn’t even touch the water. Sanya I originally came here to play in the sea and water, but the whole trip was ruined!
5. The strangest thing is that most of the hotel's swimming pools are closed early at 7 o'clock in the evening, leaving only a small 1.8-meter-deep swimming pool and a small massage pool, which makes our children and water skills not very good. How unworthy of human kindness! How can a hotel like this that doesn’t consider guests’ vacation experience retain guests at all? l
In short, I will never stay in a hotel full of pitfalls like this again!

msg:The trip to Sanya during the Spring Festival came as planned. The original plan was temporarily adjusted to Sheraton. The result was far beyond expectations. My parents loved it more than the last day of the trip to Sanya🤩The huge lawn room temperature swimming pool, timely and thoughtful room service, rich nutrition The overtime long breakfast on the independent beach, the local ethnic bamboo dance train, the instant sleep and the exclusive spa... It is so vivid that I will never forget to return. It is worth mentioning that my father's hat was lost and returned to the Sheraton in time. It was very considerate. There is no one hotel that must be chosen in Yalong Bay next time!

There was also a follow-up call from the account manager to inquire about the check-in experience and requirements. The hotel has a beautiful environment and strong privacy, making it a good place to relax.

When choosing a hotel, I was attracted by the Sheraton's garden and lawn. All the services were in place. At first, the room did not face the Sheraton's garden. They specially helped us change rooms. We will choose Sheraton next time.

msg:The first stop of the Sanya hotel check-in trip is Sheraton Yalong Bay. When I made the reservation, my dad said that he had come to this hotel often before and it was open relatively early. This stay really proves this point. The hotel is in a great location and the beach is nice. We had a beach bubble party on the first day, which was quite fun. Although the hotel was renovated in 2018, the hotel still has a sense of age. What is not easy to accept is that the air conditioning in the room is not very powerful. After staying at the beach for a long time, when I go back to the room, I feel that the room is a bit stuffy🥵. The hotel's catering has been reviewed online, so I won't talk about it again. The 288 Thai set meal on ** is still highly recommended. Tom Yum Goong and curry are very good. The hotel gym is okay, with basic equipment and can meet your needs. As for the swimming pool, it is more suitable for children, and the adult swimming pool...forget it, I won't mention it. Seaside barbecue, the a**osphere is pretty good, and the taste is just so-so. Dad's sentence is the same as it was 12 years ago, which is enough to explain the problem. I sincerely do not recommend the cocktails in the lobby, the mojito is as weak as water. Generally speaking, families with young children should find it good, and children aged 4-9 will have a lot of fun. Xiao Xie, the hotel housekeeper, is quite conscientious. It was good both during check-in and check-out. If you have any questions, you can get help in time. The service and attitude of the hotel staff are good. The health condition is also good. It is recommended to replace the toilet in the guest room. It will not cost much but will greatly improve the experience.

The free upgrade to the pool room was a surprise and very happy.
The hotel has a lot of greenery. I chatted with the lifeguards. The hotel sprays mosquito repellent regularly, so I didn't get bitten by mosquitoes when I lived in the pool room on the first floor.
The special car sent me to the airport, which was surprisingly a new BMW***.
I was very satisfied from check-in to check-out. Yalong Bay is full of hotels, and I didn't step on pitfalls. I was very satisfied!

msg:It was my first time traveling with seniors and children. I considered several nearby hotels and finally decided to stay at the Sheraton for three nights. The main reason was the sea view room and the children's activities arranged by the hotel. There is a children's area for breakfast, which is very suitable for parents and children. Although the hotel has a bit of history, the rooms don't smell musty and the children's Playclub is only suitable for little babies. In terms of service, the staff are friendly. When checking in, I asked for a room on the same floor to take care of the elderly. However, I was a little disappointed because the hotel was full and couldn't arrange it. I reported it to William at the front desk and he tried his best to cooperate. The manager Allen also actively intervened to help solve the problem and follow up. Children They arranged a late check-out for us when we were sick. The restaurant manager, who was always smiling and very friendly, and Bruce who helped us check out when we left, and Mr. Zhang who took beautiful photos for us, the enthusiasm of the staff made this wonderful. This historic hotel has saved a lot of points, and I will come back if I have the chance.

1. The check-in process was relatively fast, and we helped to upgrade the room type. The sea view in the full sea view room was very beautiful, and the bougainvillea was in full bloom by the window.
2. The public area and architectural style of Sheraton are very beautiful. You can see every step of the way. The off-white walls are paired with dark wooden structures and dark green palm trees, giving it a southern French style.
3. There seem to be four or five swimming pools, large and small, to meet the needs of all ages. Bath towels can be taken at any time by the pool, which is also very convenient. It's also very close to the beach.
4. The view during breakfast is amazing. It is so happy to relax while eating, accompanied by the sound of waves and the gentle sea breeze. The breakfast tasted pretty good. I also had the coconut chicken hotpot in the set menu at the restaurant, which was also delicious!

Next time I come to Sanya, I will also want to stay at the Sheraton~

Special praise to lifeguard Zeng Jian! ! ! !
The gardens and facilities in the hotel are really well maintained! You won't get tired of walking there for three days. The Sheraton is really great at this price.
The guest room itself is airy and clean, but the only drawback is that there is a bit of mold in the shower room (maybe it's too damp, there's nothing I can do about it, I can understand and accept it.)
The beach is excellent and Yalong Bay is very mature.
Breakfast is normal for this price range (the restaurant is really beautiful, with a semi-open design.
I will choose this place again when I come to Yalong Bay. It is very convenient for food, accommodation and transportation.

The hotel management is excellent, there are abundant green plants, and the staff are very polite. The most unforgettable thing for me is Mr. Fu Guxin from the Recreation Depar**ent. My baby loves the little train and sits on it and refuses to go back to the room. Just when I was worried, Mr. Fu came over and successfully coaxed the baby to be very happy. He also talked to the baby He said, "Listen to your mother!" The next day, I took the baby on a train, and the driver happened to be Mr. Fu. The baby liked Uncle Fu very much, so we happily took photos together. When coming to Yalong Bay from now on, I will probably give up the hotel I stayed in before and choose the Sheraton instead!

Location: Sheraton's beach location is very good, very close to entertainment options and places to eat. Especially very close to the food court next to it. This square can provide us with four meals, and they all taste very good.
Facilities: The facilities are complete. We have a small child and we have many requests. All of them are met one by one. Even the small bench is brought to the room for help. The bedding was very comfortable and I slept well. The air conditioner is a little loud, but the white noise doesn't affect your sleep.
Hygiene: Clean and tidy. The cleaning lady is very friendly and approachable. My baby likes her very much.
Environment: Just like the picture, what you see is what you get, there are views everywhere, just like the park, you can relax wherever you go
Service: There are many service staff and they are very enthusiastic. Help disinfect child seats and take the initiative to bring us children’s plates
Royal Train: I ran around in a circle and it’s pretty good to take care of the baby.
Travel photography: The photos were taken in the hotel on the island. The photographer was very professional and every photo was beautiful. The photos we requested were also taken. Although there were gifts, I still chose a lot of photos in the end.
Very satisfied with this stay. Time is in a hurry, come again next time.

msg:I like this hotel very much, and everyone in my family said that we will come back next time. Actually, I didn't have high hopes before checking in because I read some bad reviews, but after actually staying here, I unexpectedly liked it very much.
First of all, the gardens and trees of this hotel should be the densest among the hotels in Yalong Bay. I looked at the outdoor areas of several surrounding hotels. The trees are generally short, offer little shade, and are not densely packed. The Sheraton's gardens are obviously very resort-style. When walking in the park, there are lush trees and winding paths.
As for the issue that everyone generally thinks the room is old, the room is indeed not new, but it is not to the point of complaining, and it is impossible to keep staring at every corner while staying. It depends on the overall experience. In short, the room overall made me feel very warm when I stayed. The wooden furniture and bed boards made people feel very comfortable. I stayed with an elderly person, and he was also very satisfied. The room is spacious and does not feel cramped. It has a sofa and a desk, which is very convenient for using a computer. Plus, with the view outside the balcony and the garden view, no one cared about whether it was old or not when we stayed.
Talking about service, every staff member I met during my stay provided very good service. Before checking in, the butler added WeChat. Xiao Du's service is very good. You can communicate with the butler if you have any needs. When we arrived at the hotel, someone took the initiative to pick up our luggage at the door, take it all the way to the room, and introduce us to the hotel. The housekeeping lady was also very enthusiastic. She played skateboarding in the pool downstairs for a while, and the lifeguards were also very easy-going and enthusiastic. During breakfast, the restaurant staff also gave us some cookies, which was very polite and friendly. You will feel that the hotel is taking good service seriously.
Breakfast: I was originally worried that there would be queues for breakfast on holidays, but the hotel has two breakfast restaurants with the same dishes, so there is no need to worry about queues for meals. The restaurant on the first floor is outdoor and there are more people, while the restaurant on the second floor is indoor and quieter. If you feel the weather is cold, it is recommended to go to the restaurant on the second floor. The variety is okay, but the taste is a no-brainer. You can have your own refreshing tonic for breakfast, which is good.
Eating: If you don’t want to leave the hotel, the hotel’s own Baiyun Chinese Restaurant has a group purchase, a set meal for 498. The four of us were very full and tasted good. When you exit the hotel door and walk to the left, you will find Dongrong Food Street. You can reach it on foot, which is so convenient. You can buy seafood there and find a shop to process it. I ate at several of them and found the Hongsha Food Stall to be the best. Moreover, there is a supermarket on the first floor of Dongrong with a lot of things, so the location of the hotel is very good.
Beach: Walking to the beach is very close, it doesn’t take much energy, and it’s very convenient to go back and get things. The wind and waves in Yalong Bay are small, which is very suitable for resting on the beach chairs.

msg:Taking the children to Sanya every year after the Chinese New Year has become a required course at the end of every winter vacation. In the first few years, we changed hotels to have different experiences. Later, when we came from Beijing after the New Year, we stayed at the Yalong Bay Sheraton Hotel. The children were not very interested in the scenic spots. Instead, they participated in the children's playground activities in the hotel and soaked in the water. Playing on the beach feels better. I felt very deeply when I came to the Sheraton Hotel this time. Every staff member was very enthusiastic. After staying for several days, everyone became familiar with each other and felt like a family. My child and I were in a great mood that day. None of the guys want to go back to Beijing. I am going to give you a detailed guide.
1. Let’s talk about the hotel room first. Although it is an old hotel, the rooms are very bright and spacious, and they are very clean. Because I took my child there by myself, the staff helped me put the twin beds together to prevent the child from falling off the bed. They were very attentive. The twin bed was really big and comfortable, and I didn’t have to worry about the child falling off. On the first day, the child was playing in the sand and got wet from the cold sea water. In the middle of the night, he suddenly vomited and vomited on the sheets and the floor. On the second day, the service staff Zhou Huaimei carefully helped clean up the bed, changed the sheets, and showed all kinds of care to the child. I stopped letting my children play in the water today, and I was particularly touched by the mother who was taking care of her children alone. After cleaning, the manager on duty called again after a while to ask about the child's condition and whether he wanted to go to the infirmary to get some medicine or something. At that time, I My heart feels very warm.
2. The children’s playground is particularly popular with children. This time I only stayed at the Sheraton Hotel, so the daily program was fully arranged. I got up at around nine o’clock every morning to have breakfast, and then went to participate in the children’s paradise programs, fishing, and doing Dragon hat, kangaroo jumping, African tambourine, small train, crab digging...all were very fun. I saw many parents leaving their children here to participate in the program and then leaving. The staff were very attentive to help and look after them. Zhang Binbin and Fu Guxin both This little brother is simply the king of children, an all-around master. My son happily calls him Brother Binbin every time~
3. There are also many outdoor recreation projects. The constant-temperature swimming pool has a small pool suitable for children. The large constant-temperature swimming pools are all next to each other. They are all on the seaside. It is very romantic to swim with the baby and look at the endless sea. In addition to the constant-temperature swimming pool, , there are also three water parks suitable for children. There are slides and other things, which the children particularly like. There is a big slide that both children and adults like to play. I have played with my children several times. It is really fun and exciting. There is also a pool. It is shallower and you can enjoy rowing and surfing. The manager Xiaoyang is very good and the service is enthusiastic. He walks back and forth in these swimming pools every day. He works very seriously. My son calls him Brother Xiaoyang~
4. The breakfast in the hotel is also great, with many categories, food and drinks. I have to walk around a few times every morning. There are so many that I don’t know what to eat, hahaha... The fruits are also very fresh. The staff member Xu Ting is very helpful. , the people are beautiful and the work and service are excellent.
All in all, next time I come to Sanya, my first choice is Sheraton. The service is very good in every aspect. After we checked out and went to the airport, the customer service manager called us to ask us what we thought of the hotel. They were all very enthusiastic. Not bad, not bad, sincerely highly recommended! Hahaha... I feel so deeply, and this is a really serious ✍️ review. I hope it can be a reference for everyone.

The hotel has its own beach, but the sand is a bit rough and it's a bit harsh on your feet without shoes. The hotel has a studio that specializes in taking photos. The photos are pretty good and the charges are pretty good. It’s similar to the photo studios in Beijing. You can give it a try. The hotel is not too far from the surrounding attractions. We chartered our own car and basically saw the main ones in two days. However, I felt it was more fun to play in the hotel, as there were still too many people at the attractions.

msg:Environment: The hotel is large and beautiful, with blue sky, white clouds, green trees and flowers, and tropical scenery everywhere. The hotel is very close to the beach. You can reach the beach in a few minutes' walk, which is very convenient. The sea water is very clean. We lived in 1709, and the view on the 7th floor was very good. Looking down, we saw a large green forest with a clear swimming pool, and looking up, we saw the vast sea. Since it faces the east, you can draw the curtains in the morning and watch the sunrise while lying in bed, which is very beautiful.

Facilities: The facilities are very new, there are several swimming pools, they are all clean, and the security officers are very responsible and watch the whole process to avoid accidents. There is a swimming pool where you can row a boat. Ctrip's package package gives you one free ride. The guy at the hotel saw that we were two people and gave another free ride. Thank you very much.

Service: I have bad legs, so I borrowed a wheelchair from the hotel. The 500 deposit was refunded in the end. It was so considerate. I didn’t have to carry the wheelchair on and off the plane. If my family members have inconvenient legs and feet, I strongly recommend borrowing a wheelchair from the hotel. It is best to call in advance to make a reservation. The hotel staff are very enthusiastic. They clean the room every day and write thoughtful notes.

Eat and drink: There is a buffet every morning. It is recommended to go to the restaurant on the first floor for breakfast. There are many people and a lot of things. In addition, I also tried the hotel's open-air barbecue buffet by the sea in the evening, which cost 1,088 yuan for two people. The overall feeling was good and the taste was quite good. There is a fruit shop on the first floor. Fruits can be delivered upstairs, so you don't have to run around yourself. Other takeaways need to be picked up from the lobby. Dongrong Food City is very close to the hotel, just a few minutes' walk away. The coconut chicken there is particularly delicious, and there are many other seafood and barbecue specialties.

The overall feeling is very satisfying!

2. There are singing and lion dancing during the Spring Festival, creating a strong festive a**osphere
3. The lobby is grand and the resident singers in the lobby bar are very popular.
4. Coconut groves and grasslands with red lanterns are picturesque
5. The beach and the sea are close at hand, and the beach is soft
6. Upon request, the room was deodorized. The hotel staff provided us with a dehumidifier, which was very considerate.
7. Whether it’s the lobby, swimming pool, coconut grove, beach or sea, it’s all stunning.
8. Very suitable for bringing the elderly and children to experience
9. Convenient for dining around

Except for the smell in the room (which is much better after using a dehumidifier) ​​and the facilities that need to be updated, we are very satisfied.

msg:The location of the hotel is very good. The view of the beach and sea when you walk out is very beautiful. However, the hotel room facilities are relatively old. It doesn't matter if they are clean. I booked a garden view room. There is a musty smell when entering the room. Where does the garden view come from? ? There is almost no outside view from such a large platform. I asked the front desk to change rooms and they changed to two rooms in opposite directions, and there was no garden view! ! Very dissatisfied, I ended up staying in this plastic lawn garden view room. During the Spring Festival, an extra bed costs 1,000. Yalong Bay Sheraton is crazy for money, and there is no service during the whole trip. It is completely incomparable with Wanning Shenzhou Peninsula.

I come to Sanya every winter to celebrate the New Year and have stayed in various hotels. The experience I got at the Yalong Bay Sheraton this year is really great! The room is large and the bed is very spacious. If you bring children, you can add an extra bed. The bedding is very comfortable. The most important thing is that the services in all aspects are very good... In addition, the hotel has many swimming pools to play in, plenty of beach loungers, and excellent sea views. We had a lot of fun with the bubble show in the evening! If the Spring Festival comes, you must book a New Year’s Eve dinner at the beach! The a**osphere is immediately filled, and parents and children are full of praises👏🏻👏🏻The most important thing is that it is very cost-effective, the breakfast is rich and varied, and the hotel has a huge lawn that is very interesting! I recommend Yalong Bay Sheraton🥳🥳🥳

msg:The hotel environment is very good, especially the lobby, which is the most grand among the surrounding hotels and makes people feel very open and spectacular. The supporting facilities are complete and it is convenient to go to the beach. The swimming pool is small and suitable for playing in the water.
The room is spacious, bright and clean, with a large balcony and a clothes drying rack. The layout is also very comfortable, but the decoration style is very old and even feels dilapidated. The wall tiles in the bathroom are stained with mold, the metal parts on the lighting are also rusty, the toilet is also very old, and the toilet seat does not have a slow-down function. , if you accidentally drop it, it will make a lot of noise and even startle you. The bed is too soft, the bathrobes and sheets and quilt covers are very thin, the cotton content is insufficient, and it has no texture. It is not as good as the Four Points I have stayed in before. Stayed for one night and then moved to the Marriott next door. Nowadays, better unknown hotels have smart toilets. I hope Sheraton can renovate the room carefully.
The service is worthy of recognition. The waiters I saw were very professional, had good service awareness and were very attentive.
The breakfast is rich and delicious, and the dining environment is very comfortable.

I booked a hotel at JW Marriott Shanhaitian for two nights. After staying for one day, I couldn’t stand the environment. It’s not in the urban area. Don't choose it if you are on a business trip. In the end, I felt uncomfortable and left a day early, so I'd better choose Yalong Bay. The Sheraton's garden and swimming pool are great, and the breakfast restaurant on the first floor is very good. It's the peak Spring Festival season, so you need to order in advance. The butler service was very good and gave the children breakfast, thank you. Next time, I will decide to choose a hotel in Yalong Bay or Haitang Bay.

One room was not let in until five o'clock. Fortunately, the manager upgraded all four rooms for us and the poolside room service was still there. Very good
The hotel's swimming pool is not too big, but it doesn't matter to me. It's just enough for taking pictures. It's still very photogenic. The beach is also very delicate and clean.
The bread for breakfast was so delicious that I missed it even after I left. Haha, the variety of other dishes is also quite rich.
I also had a buffet at the beach in the evening, 328/person, 628/2 people. Anyway, I couldn’t come back, but the a**osphere was very good and the band sang and played games. It was a very pleasant night.
I didn’t take any pictures of the hotel room, but I really like it. The design of the large window in the bathtub is very impressive, and the wall lamps are quite retro.
Overall, it is a very satisfactory hotel. I will choose Sheraton next time.

msg:This time I booked a Sheraton atoll poolside room for three nights. The interior of the room was not as old as expected, but had a hint of retro flavor. The response speed of the waiters is still very fast, and the delivery requirements for items are quickly met. The balcony of this room type opens the door and you can step into the swimming pool. The children have a lot of fun. The balcony door is very well sealed, and you can barely hear the sound of swimming in the pool when the door is closed. However, the only disadvantage of the poolside room is that the smell of moisture is greater. There are pros and cons. It all depends on the needs of each family. In addition, the garden environment and swimming pool design of Sheraton are still very good. They take care of the needs of different groups of people and are very impressive. I like the constant temperature swimming pool next to the large lawn the most. It is very friendly for this season. The depth of the swimming pool can also allow adults to swim. stand up. None of the surrounding hotels are this deep. When you are tired from swimming, just rest on the deck chair, enjoy the sea breeze and look at the sea. Sheraton is overall very grand and does not fall into the messy state of a pure family hotel, so the experience is enhanced a lot, and it is more suitable for friends who like a quiet vacation mode. Breakfasts in all hotels are similar. You don’t have to worry too much about breakfast. Whether the food is delicious depends on what kind of mood you feel when you wake up in the morning and what kind of people you eat with. The waiters in the restaurant were very enthusiastic and collected the dirty dishes very quickly, which resulted in me eating a lot every day. There is almost no queue at the door, but during peak dining times remember to ask the waiter in white at the door to help find a seat. In addition, the hotel pays great attention to guest reviews and proactively contacted us to learn about our accommodation experience, which made me feel good.

I was upgraded to a room when I checked in. I stayed in a room on the first floor and was adjacent to the swimming pool. I could just push the fence and swim a few times. I was very satisfied with the location. It greatly improved the comfort of the trip. I could sit there when I had nothing to do. The balcony is very comfortable for sunbathing or taking a nap.
Because I’m not very interested in gift projects, I haven’t experienced any of them. It depends on personal needs. The hotel still has the Chinese New Year a**osphere, so I took some photos. The place where the hotel can film is the coconut tree on the left hand side near the beach. I feel that the light is the best around 4 o'clock in the afternoon. Yes, the weather is also a bonus, so be sure to check the weather in advance when traveling.

The room is large and not oppressive. When the weather is good, the view from the balcony is really unbeatable. Children love the flowers on the balcony. We stayed for three days in total. Although there was some incident on the third night. The guests upstairs kept making noise in the early morning. Delia, the hotel manager on duty, dealt with it quickly. After learning that we had not had a good rest at night, she immediately arranged a late check-out. It was nice. After a good night's sleep, he actively provided help with all subsequent questions, and his attitude was excellent, which really made it hard to get angry. It is indeed the service that a five-star hotel should have. I will choose here again next time I come to Sanya.

When I checked in, the air conditioner only fluctuated at 20 degrees. When the maintenance workers came to see it, it was still not repaired, and the air outlet of the air conditioner was very dirty. It may not have been cleaned in 20 years.
Bedding: The bed is extremely soft and uncomfortable to sleep on. It is not the bedding that a five-star hotel should have at all. It is also possible that too many people have slept on it in 20 years, and the bed is too collapsed. There were also red stains on the sheets, which may not have been washed.
Breakfast: The dishes are average and cannot be compared to the surrounding five-star hotels. Although it is a family hotel, there is no bib for the baby. I bought a two-night package for 2699 and got a free meal. I chose paella and made a reservation for 6:30. After arriving at the restaurant, I had to wait for 20 minutes before the meal was brought out. The rice was half-cooked and contained six shrimps ( Is one of them dead?) You dare to call it paella, but one review still gave it 268 copies!
Environment: The environment is very good, with dense trees. In other words, the rooms are all blocked by trees and cannot see the sea.
Summary: I will never stay at the Yalong Bay Sheraton again. It costs 2,699 for two nights and an average of 1,350 for one night. It simply does not meet the corresponding service standards. Except for being close to the beach, everything else is very poor. Don’t waste your money. I stayed in Haitang Bay for 1,500 a night, which was also a five-star hotel. It was much better than this!

I experienced the 20-minute rowing project and asked my father to go. I also took a lot of photos. My father liked it very much and will come again next time.

Serve:
It's much better than what I saw online. They are very friendly and thoughtful. I also read all the messages carefully and reply to them.


facility:
It's a bit old, but it doesn't affect the experience at all. The TV is also quite new, but the network is not very fast, so the screencasting won't work. It doesn't affect watching the New Year's Eve party.


health:
There are indeed some moldy areas. It is excusable for an older hotel on the beach.

environment:
It really exceeded expectations. My parents think the scenery in the hotel is much better than the scenic spots outside. I took a lot of photos and they all like them.
I also felt very good when shooting with a film camera.

The swimming pool is great for children to play in the water. The guys at the concierge were very attentive in picking up the luggage and opening the door.

It was really a five-star service! The buffet at the beach in the evening was so sentimental, and the resident singer even sang a happy birthday song to the baby, which was so touching. Celebrating a birthday here is perfect! The days at the Sheraton were really unforgettable and memorable. Special thanks to the housekeeper Lydia and the concierge Xiaoshuo.

The next day, when there was a room, the front desk helped us move to a high floor. Downstairs is the children's swimming pool, which is 1 meter deep and suitable for children over 5 years old. I booked a free trial of windsurfing on Ctrip. It is a family-friendly experience in the hotel every day. The activities are very good, and the guy who teaches snorkeling is very good and encourages the children until they master it. After comparing many hotels in Yalong Bay, Sheraton is very cost-effective. It has a gorgeous lobby and a large green area. There is a shopping mall on the left side of the hotel where you can eat. It is a 15-minute walk from Baihuagu Commercial Street. After eating, take a walk. Next time Definitely your first choice, give it a thumbs up!

I stayed for three nights and the hotel was cleaned every day. It was very clean and there was no garbage in the park.
From taking a taxi to the place, the waiter opening the door to pick up the luggage, to checking out, I felt very comfortable, and my needs were basically met. However, the hotel cannot heat the seafood I eat out, but the rice can be heated.
It may be my first time to come to Sanya, but anyway, Sheraton gives me a very good feeling and I am very satisfied! I would like to stay here again in the future and I highly recommend it to my friends. I saw that many netizens said that the decoration of Sheraton is relatively old, but I didn't feel that when I stayed here. It has everything you need, but you may not have experienced the newer hotel facilities around it. But this one is very satisfying. Recommended to all netizens. You won't regret it for sure.

msg:This is my first time staying at the Yalong Bay Sheraton Hotel. As soon as I entered the lobby, I felt a tropical style with a very grand wooden structure. When I checked in at the front desk, I was asked if I wanted to upgrade my room. I thought it was free and agreed, but it turned out that upgrading to sea view required an additional room for ¥327 per day, which made me feel a little confused, but when I entered the big room When I saw the sea view, I felt that maybe the money was worth it. Sheraton is a standard five-star hotel. The garden design is very good, very clean, you can see every step of the way, and the breakfast is also very delicious. In particular, I must sigh with emotion. Every service staff is very service-minded. Even the cleaning staff you meet on the road will greet you with a very beautiful smile, not to mention the exclusive butler who starts greeting you early. If you need anything, you can contact the housekeeper. The little housekeeper Nini assigned to me this time was very considerate and answered all my questions. When I left the hotel, another butler, Xiao Yang, provided us with a very fast checkout and helped us take our luggage to the taxi. In addition, he also gave us a Sheraton wooden necklace as a gift to invite us again. Come to Sheraton. The gift package provided by Ctrip includes several items. We have tried them all. Be sure to book in advance. Each one is very good. If I have to mention a little improvement, it would be his swimming pool. The temperature of the swimming pool we visited in mid-December was between 24 and 25 degrees, which is not very friendly to people who are afraid of cold. If the temperature-controlled swimming pool can be opened, it will not allow you to face the sea from a distance. Take a dip and there will be no regrets. There is another small episode here. No matter how carefully I checked, I finally pulled my mobile phone charger into the room. After I arrived at the airport, I found out that I immediately contacted Xiao Yang and Nini. They were very active in helping me find it, and also sent it through SF Express. Aren’t you very touched that you can help me return to Beijing without any charge? I would like to sincerely thank the Sheraton Hotel and the housekeepers Nini and Xiao Yang. I wish you a happy work! ￼

Different from the large farmhouse in Tianyu next to it and the American-style MGM in Las Vegas, Sheraton's architecture, greening, and some furnishings have a quieter, natural and friendly feel. There are many places to relax inside the hotel, and the number of lounge chairs by the swimming pool and beach is enough to cope with the high occupancy rate in these two days. Some suggestions for improvement: The sound insulation of the room is not ideal/The tea cabinet in the room is slightly simple, and all drinks are charged for water removal😂/The customer service staff contacted by the reservation depar**ent was average. I called to make a reservation on the same day and said that all room types were fully booked. I recommended that I go to the hotel next door. But I must have booked a room on Ctrip. I don’t understand this operation very well.../ps: Except for a pool with swimming lanes and a special mini pool similar to the size of a hot spring, which has a constant temperature, the water in other swimming pools is at normal temperature. In this season It's basically impossible to get down. Lying on the lounge chair next to me, I can only say that I saw the swimming pool as a scenery.

msg:During this trip to Sanya, I stayed at the Sheraton for 4 nights. The overall experience was great. The whole family felt that they had a very happy and comfortable stay, so I will write an objective family hotel guide for everyone.

Let’s talk about the shortcomings first: Sheraton is one of the representatives of Sanya’s old high-end hotels. Objectively speaking, the room facilities are a bit old. But other than this, I really can’t fault it. However, because it was established early, it has a good a**osphere. geographical location and sea area advantages.

Environment: Whether it is the lawn by the sea or the flowers and plants in the park, it has the style of a big hotel. No filters are needed to take photos, it is so beautiful. What I like most is the breakfast location at Sheraton. It’s so comfortable to watch the sea and have breakfast over and over again!

Parents and children: This time I came with the elderly and children, which is why I chose Sheraton. For children, the hotel has various special activities, most of which are free, so children will not be bored if they stay here for a few days; for the elderly, the hotel's garden-style construction makes them feel like they are living in a park.

Service: Sheraton's service is still very good. If you have any needs, the hotel manager will help you solve them one by one. The staff at the door will help you solve your baggage handling problem as soon as you get off. You don't need to do anything at all. Here is a real-name recognition of Kevin Zhang.

In short, if I am traveling with my children next time, I will choose Sheraton again.

The sea view room I chose this time was better than the garden view room the first time, so the experience was much enhanced. Last year, I stayed in the beautiful hotel next door. From the overall garden planning and design of the hotel, I feel that I prefer the grandeur of the Sheraton, but the sea view room in the MGM has a better view due to its geographical advantage, and you can also watch the sunrise. In short, the two hotels have their own characteristics.

There is no need to turn on the air conditioner in mid-November. It’s super cool. I absolutely love Sheraton.
Got it! ! ! Next time you come to Sanya, you must visit Sheraton! !

msg:The hotels in the Yalong Bay area are relatively old, but in comparison, the Sheraton Resort Hotel stands out~
At the end of November, I booked a room at a price of just over 1,000💰. I checked in directly🆙. The price/performance ratio is excellent.

🥰Experience:
After staying for 2 nights, I experienced it. The grass and green plants in the public areas are well maintained and very impressive.

Compared with hotels with higher unit prices compared to guests, the Sheraton buffet has a rich variety, but the taste can only be said to be passable, and there are many outdoor swimming pools.

❤️Welfare tips

If you register as a Marriott member (free), you will also enjoy dining discounts after your stay🥂 + beach toys and swimming rings, very considerate benefits

Service: The overall service is very good, especially the front desk, which is fast and considerate.

The decoration of the entire hotel is grand and stable. Standing in the lobby, the sea breeze blows in your face. It is worth mentioning that the lobby bar has an excellent location for taking photos, which is very Southeast Asian style.
The room is bright, clean and spacious. The hotel's garden is full of scenery, and you can even encounter squirrels, birds, and lizards, which shows how good the natural conditions are. The weather was sunny during the two days we came, and the sea was as far as the eye could see. All worries and worries were not worth mentioning in front of the sea.
There are many kinds of breakfast and it tastes delicious. The hotel staff are very friendly and greet you with a smile, which makes people feel warm.

This time I brought an old man here and asked for a quieter, higher-rise room, and the hotel accommodated him. The hotel's room service, front desk service and butler service are all 5 stars. The room is big enough, the software is good, but the hardware is that the toilet is a bit backward. You have to hold down to flush. Upgrading the toilet is the first priority. Another dissatisfaction is the breakfast. There are relatively few varieties. The key is that the ingredients and quality are average. It is very acceptable and hopes to improve.

You could hear it clearly from the terrace, but when you closed the door, there was no sound at all. The service is also top-notch. When the waiter saw that we had children with us, he took the initiative to provide children's toiletries. He also took the initiative to replenish purified water. Baiyun Chinese Restaurant tastes very good and is recommended. Also, the Sheraton toothbrush has hard bristles, which is really easy to use and is what I like. See you next time...

It turns out that I made the right choice. Although it rains most of the time, fortunately, the green ecology of the hotel park is very good. You can see squirrels and snails when walking, and birds fly to the table next to the meal from time to time. It can be seen that the hotel pays more attention to the ecological concept. All aspects of the check-in are smoothly connected, and the service details are well done and can highlight the humanized and personalized service👍🏻Although the facilities are a bit older, after staying in many hotels in different cities, I feel a little more "precipitated". btw I would like to praise the duty manager Allen, he is very considerate and also has a sense of proportion in his work~

msg:This is the first time I went to Sanya, and I took my two children with me. I listened to my friends and booked a good hotel by the sea for a few days. The location of the room arranged by the front desk is not bad. On the sixth floor, you can just see the sea. The swimming pool is downstairs, which is also a view. The hygiene in the house is very clean, and the responsible cleaning guy is very nice and enthusiastic. The hotel is just a few minutes' walk from the beach. It's very close. It's very convenient for children to play. The quality of the private beach is very nice! The swimming pool in the hotel is also very convenient and clean. There are gyms, children's activity areas, small supermarkets, and fruit spots. There is also a night market nearby, where you can order takeaway. When it's quiet late at night, sitting on the balcony and hearing the sound of the waves is really pleasant! Since we had to catch up with the next stop, we only stayed for three nights, and we were a bit sad, and we will choose this place next time.

The hotel environment is elegant, with green grass, and the food in the restaurant is delicious. Next time I go to Sanya, I will choose Sheraton Yalong Bay.

First they upgraded us to a sea view room, then thoughtfully provided a cake for our 5-year-old daughter's birthday and decorated the room. The waiter saw that we were carrying our second treasure and provided many bottles of water. We were simply flattered. Thank you to Manager Yuanyang for your silent efforts. See you next time. One more thing, the hotel’s parent-child activities are very unique. My daughter braided her hair every day and also learned to wakeboard.

msg:Choosing Sheraton as my first stop in Sanya was very wise and very satisfying. Although there are mixed reviews, I still trust the established international five-star hotel. In addition, Sheraton is cost-effective at this location, so I firmly chose this hotel and I was not disappointed. The hotel is very beautiful and grand, the environment is great, the swimming pool and beach are very good. I went with my parents and booked a deluxe sea view room. I used Ctrip points to upgrade to a premium sea view room. The room is large and has a sofa, which is especially suitable for a family of three. There is a clothes drying pole on the balcony of the room, which is a godsend for mothers who love cleanliness. There are several swimming pools in the hotel, and each one is very beautiful. Anyway, my father played in this pool and that pool, and I couldn't even take a photo. Then the service is also very good and very welcoming. Whether it is in the restaurant, at the pool, or at the beach, as soon as a waiter appears, they will greet you warmly and ask if there is anyone who needs help. The only problem is that it's a bit difficult to find the restrooms by the pool and beach because there are no signs. Everything else is fine. The breakfast variety is also rich enough. Only the coffee tastes terrible. But the coffee in the hotel lobby bar is very good. I ordered a cup and sat facing the incomparable sea view. Wow, it’s so comfortable~~ After staying for three days and two nights, I didn’t need to leave the hotel at all. It was a lot of fun and the food was satisfying. There is no time to see Guanyin in the South China Sea at all ends of the world 😂 Lydia, the hotel’s housekeeper, added WeChat before I went there. She also helped me apply for a late check-out. Thank you very much. Then Fu Guxin, the brother who tried paddleboarding by the pool Very patient. Andy, the waiter at Coastal BBQ in the evening, was also very considerate. The service guy who helped me order the meal, whose name I don’t know, was also very enthusiastic and helped me book the best dinner table. The young lady at breakfast was also very helpful. Gentle, in short, the service is very serious, and you can feel their welcome to hotel guests. The travel photos sent by the hotel were also very good, without any promotion. Although I wanted to bargain with them for more, they didn't accept it, but it didn't matter. I asked for five original photos. In fact, the original photos were very good. In short, the hotel is very good. Although it is a little old, the hotel culture of this old international five-star hotel that has been accumulated for many years is still very comfortable. All in all, these two nights were very unforgettable. I would recommend it to every friend around me who wants to come to Yalong Bay~~

I have stayed with sea view before, and I liked the pool view this time.

This time there are two staff members that I have more contact with and I have to praise them more, Xiao Xie from the concierge and Zeng Jian from the lifeguard!
Xiao Xie is attentive and thoughtful, and helps with everything from check-in, ordering, and check-out~
I met Zeng Jian while paddle boarding in the swimming pool. He is very humorous and enthusiastic. He is a local, which made me have a good impression of Hainan.

My suggestion is that the shower head in the hotel bathroom is a bit old and the water is not very flush. The gym equipment is also a bit old. I like other garden designs and decoration styles very much.

The most touching thing is the considerate five-star service. Everything is so meticulous and thoughtful. Sheraton’s parent-child activities It is also very rich, and the gifts for children are really sincere. Many water sports are included. Both adults and children can have fun in large and small swimming pools. The hotel breakfast environment is very good and there are many varieties, especially fruit varieties. Served with tropical fruits, the waffles tasted particularly good. I couldn’t eat enough for breakfast for two days in a row. This time I chose Sheraton Sanya Yalong Bay and I was not disappointed at all. I will choose this place next time. I am especially grateful to the duty manager named Delia, who is very considerate. I'm really touched by your concern.

Every time I called the front desk, I had to ring at least five times before being answered. Twice, no one answered and I had to call again. This is something I have never encountered before.
The concierge and the aunt who cleans the room are very nice. Special thanks to Xiao Zuo for helping arrange the airport transfer. I forgot the name of the aunt who cleans the room. Specially added toys such as Happy Farm and Little Trojan Horse for children
There is no air conditioning in the breakfast restaurant on the first floor, and cockroaches were seen. The breakfast variety is okay, anyway the normal standard of buffet breakfast.
I ordered coconut once from the food delivery depar**ent. The first time there was no logo. I called and quickly replaced it with one with the logo. Thank you very much.
The beach, swimming pool, and train are all very good. The driver of the train is very enthusiastic. Sand digging tools are free, but swimming rings cost money to rent.
The sea view of the Ambassador Suite is great. The room facilities are also OK and relatively clean. There is no plug in the bedroom, which is inconvenient. However, the fruit in the room is only given for one day. Other hotels give a piece of fruit every day.

Especially when we arrived at the hotel, the handsome man at the front desk upgraded us to a room with a better view of the sea. This was despite the shortage of rooms during the National Day holiday, which shows that the hotel pays enough attention to its guests. ! The beautiful Southeast Asian landscape style makes the Sheraton an ideal choice for families or couples. Although the hotel room facilities are a bit old, they are very complete. There were no problems with the room during the stay. The swimming pool is enough for fun. There is a large lawn on the way to the hotel's exclusive beach with a wide view. The buffet breakfast and beach seafood BBQ buffet dinner are delicious. The hotel staff will promptly add WeChat messages upon check-in to provide meticulous and thoughtful services, including booking various parent-child projects, marine projects, etc. The price is much cheaper than outside. When swimming in the pool or at the beach, there will be hotel security guards throughout the process. care. There are two night markets near the hotel that can be reached on foot, but it is recommended to go to Baihua Valley Commercial Street and Little Dolphin Seafood Plaza.
Next time I come to Sanya for vacation, I will stay at Sheraton👍

The hotel lobby has a very high ceiling and is quite impressive. The facilities can be seen as an older hotel. The decoration is very old-fashioned, but it is clean.
Disadvantages: 1. The Yaochi Western Restaurant where you eat is open-air, there is no air conditioner, only fans, it is too hot to eat.
2. The water in the bath is either too hot or too cold, and there is no way to adjust it. The mobile nozzle is crooked as soon as the water is turned on, making it difficult to use at all.

Services: 1. Thank you very much Xiao Cai from the concierge depar**ent, who took the initiative to help us take our luggage to the room, and then helped us book a shuttle bus, answered every question in detail, and gave a good plan, thank you.
2. I am very grateful to Dr. Liu in the infirmary. He is dedicated and warm-hearted. He helped my husband deal with the wound. He is meticulous and patient. He also sent advice and blessings. He helped us change the gauze before nine o'clock in the morning, which made us feel very warm. Heart.
3. I am very grateful to the chef of Yaochi Western Restaurant (a man wearing glasses, the exact name is unknown), who immediately helped me solve the problem after learning that I don’t eat black vinegar sauce. He is dedicated and professional.
4. The staff are very gentle and will say hello when they see them, giving them a sense of intimacy.
Disadvantages: 1. When I checked in, I asked to add a WeChat, but I didn’t add me immediately, but was procrastinated and left alone. It was Mr. Xiao Cai from the concierge who took the initiative to help add WeChat. Maybe the check-in is an internship Come on, my name is withheld here.
2. I had to wait 50 minutes for the [Hainan Chicken Rice] ordered from Yaochi Western Restaurant! ! It is recommended that you inform us in advance next time that you will have to wait so long.
3. The person who took the order at Yaochi Western Restaurant failed to understand my requirements for the salad and added the sauce, which made the whole dish very painful to eat. The chef later came forward and wanted to change a plate for us. I felt that there was no need to waste so much. Please provide a new plate of sauce to dip your own food in. It is recommended to strengthen the training of ordering personnel to avoid wasting food and diners' emotions.
4. The aunt who cleaned the room failed to clean it in time. It is recommended that more room cleaners be sent to the first floor next time.

I read reviews that said the hotel was old. I didn't think it did have the vicissitudes of time, but it was clean and tidy. We upgraded everything. The sea view room has a beautiful view. There are many places to play in the park. The service is warm and thoughtful. The housekeeper Lydia is particularly good. I would like to praise it. We also chose the beach buffet and it was very good. The breakfast was rich and not crowded. The service in the lobby was also great.

The sea view at the entrance of the lobby is beautiful. Playing in the sea at 11 o'clock in the morning, I really felt the scorching heat of Sanya's sun, and the large lawn near the sea was carefully maintained and trimmed by special personnel, which added a lot of points to the hotel. Finally, let’s talk about the room, which is spacious and tidy. The twin beds are much wider than the twin beds in ordinary hotels. The folding shutters between the bathroom and the bedroom are too impressive. I would like to praise the six bottles of water service. I have stayed in many hotels. Two bottles of free bottled water are standard. If you need to add water, you must call the main station. Sheraton provides six bottles of free drinking water every day. In the weather like Sanya, two people have six bottles of water a day , It saves the need for customers to find the main station, this is the service that depends on the details.

Although the decoration of the Sheraton is a bit old, it is still very distinctive. I think Like a park, walking and swimming in the hotel every day, and eating are already fulfilling. The hotel management is relatively humane, quiet and clean. The breakfast is very good, the service is also very good, the waiter can clean in time, not perfunctory.

The only downside is that there is always a smell of seafood in the corridor, I don't know what's going on. When I checked out, I left the vacuum flask on the coffee table in the lobby. With the idea of ​​giving it a try, I called the hotel to find it. Wendy was particularly enthusiastic about helping me find it twice, and successfully found it and sent it to the next hotel I stayed in by courier. The service is amazing!

msg:Sheraton's management and service are still very good. The day before check-in, I received a confirmation call from the hotel staff to confirm our approximate check-in time and the number of people staying.
Hotel environment:
The location of the hotel is very good, the green plants are beautiful, it has a Southeast Asian style, and the sea view is particularly beautiful. Originally, I was planning to go to Thailand for the holiday, but I changed it to Sanya temporarily. After living in the Sheraton for a week, I felt that this itinerary change was very sensible. Living in the Sheraton feels no less inferior to a star hotel in Thailand. The hardware and hotel services in the room are even better.
Service experience:
The staff at the front desk, Zhu Moran, helped to check in quickly and well. I checked into the room with almost no waiting. Later, I learned that I had an evening flight and helped me with a late check-out.
I like the staff at the swimming pools. The water in several swimming pools is very clean. The children go swimming every day. Every staff member is very polite. Special praise to the staff Zeng Jian for patiently teaching my baby the skills of swimming and kayaking. He not only pays attention to the safety of swimming tourists, but also interacts with children from time to time, which is very friendly.
Hotel Hygiene:
The cleaners in the hotel are also very good. They have already cleaned the room very quietly when they come back from breakfast tomorrow, and they will give 6 bottles of water thoughtfully.
Liu Li, the front desk manager, thoughtfully gave the child a small gift. The child likes it very much, thank you very much!
Disadvantages: Some facilities in the hotel are a bit old, the toilet in the bathroom does not flush well, the network signal in the room is not good, and the sound insulation in the room is poor. I hope it can be optimized.
Overall, the hotel service is very good, adding a good mood to our holiday!

Facilities: It is indeed the same as many Raiders said, with a sense of age, but I personally feel that it is still up to standard. The hotel's parent-child activities are colorful, and there is a detailed time list.

Hygiene: Needless to say, clean and tidy.

Environment: Full score 💯, one of the C places on Yalong Bay Beach, I chose a room with a full sea view, as in the picture uploaded in the attachment, the balcony is the scenery. Even in the rest area of ​​the public area, there is a charming sea view outside the window.

The concierge at the front desk, Xiao Xie, was very nice. Because I didn’t have so much time to look at my phone with my baby, I almost missed the time to sign up for the duty-free shop. When I was shopping, I found out that there were discount coupons to be collected, and I asked Xiao Xie to help open it temporarily.
Facilities: The hotel facilities are not as exaggerated as the online reviews. Relatively speaking, there are two restaurants for breakfast. The restaurant on the second floor has air conditioning, but Sanya is really hot, and the doors are all open. Relatively speaking, it is not so cool

There was only one bottle of shower gel and two bottles of shampoo in the bathroom, but no conditioner. There is no guide in the room. I don’t know the dining time, location, or how to access WiFi. I have to ask. No waiter offered to help with the suitcases. The so-called butler only recommends outdoor dining for 358-600 yuan per person. Check-in at the front desk requires a deposit of 1,500 yuan. Ctrip paid the room fee first and it said it was a warranty deposit, so then
Forget it, but a customer next to him is not convinced and can convert it into room charges through the platform. As soon as I arrived, I filled out a form, signed and reported my license plate number. When I came out the next day, I still had to pay because it was said that the system did not record it. When checking out, another room fee was deducted, and the platform still refused to refund the warranty deposit. This is the service of a five-star hotel. Speechless!

The rooms are old everywhere, but the main thing is clean! What is the stain on the sheets? ! I didn’t expect to use the disposable sleeping bag I prepared for the five-star popular Xilai board. I knew I should bring an extra one.
Arrived at 12 o'clock, told me that the room was not cleaned, and it was not cleaned at 2 o'clock? ! We didn't move in until 2:10!
Store your luggage, no one will take care of it when you pick it up, just take it by yourself.
The free 10% off Atlantis Aquarium ticket is more expensive than any other platform. If you don’t want to do this kind of activity, don’t do it, as if I took advantage of it. The other free tickets are all 30 kilometers away. Do you have a car to go back and forth?
One star is for the lifeguard in charge of the paddle board, and the concierge guy in the front lobby.

There are also lifeguard brothers who are enthusiastic and responsible. They will teach the children to swim in their spare time. Among them, brother Luo Mingwei is meticulous and responsive, making him feel at home.

msg:The first day I went to Sanya, I chose the Sheraton Yalong Bay Resort Hotel. Because I drove there by myself, when I parked the car and walked to the hotel entrance, no one asked or guided me to check in. I waited at the front desk for almost 20 minutes, and none of the guests in front of me checked in. Okay, let's get a little pissed off. Fortunately, at this time, the manager on duty, Allen Li Pixin, immediately asked about it and helped him to check in. At the same time, he upgraded the room type, saw that he was bringing children, and gave him a drink as a gift. During this period, his attitude was friendly and patient, so he had to order it manually for the manager on duty, Allen Li Pixin. Like 👍🏻.
Check-in room has a panoramic view of the sea, and the room is very spacious, there is a bathtub, the layout of the room is reasonable, and there is a drying rod on the balcony.
The hotel has several swimming pools and a children's water park. The photos are very good. The indoor children's park is suitable for babies under five years old.
In the evening, there are resident singers at the seaside barbecue, and the a**osphere is also very nice. The most commendable thing is that there is a children's camping viewing area, so it is more worry-free to bring children to eat.
The experience of the small train the next morning was also very good. It took about 10 minutes to go around the hotel, starting at 10 o'clock and departing on the hour.
There is nothing to say about the hotel environment. It has its own beach with fine sand and free beach loungers. The breakfast restaurant is in the center of the pool, and you can see the sea view. The dining environment is good, but the breakfast quality can only be said to be so-so, and the staple food is partial Many, basically not many choices.
Generally speaking, the Sheraton Yalong Bay Resort is more preferred for family trips and couples taking leisure photos.

msg:When I was about to go to Sanya, I started looking for a hotel on Ctrip. After searching for about two weeks, I finally decided to stay at the Sheraton
I saw many netizens talking about the achievements of luxury. In fact, I think it is okay. In fact, it is better to live in a hotel that has been open for two or three years. There is no smell of formaldehyde and the facilities are still relatively new. But after the epidemic has been three years old, I think it is nothing. Let's open a new hotel! Sheraton's level, I think it is acceptable.
Probably because of the weather in Sanya, so each room is equipped with a lot of mineral water, and there is almost no need to buy water by yourself.
There are a total of 5 swimming pools in the hotel, big and small. It is good for those who bring their children to play, but the water is relatively shallow, and the daughter is relatively large, which is a bit small for him.
The beach is really convenient, and there are many sea sports. We stayed for two nights and came to the beach four or five times. Looking at the sea at different times still has different feelings, whether it is the color or the size of the waves.
Here I want to say something in particular. The little girl who checked in at the front desk is both beautiful and good-sounding. She helped us allocate a room with a balcony, and each balcony can dry clothes. Convenient, keep washing swimsuits and laundry. It would be great if the room can be equipped with a basin.
There are two food courts around the Sheraton. Dining is also very convenient. If you don’t want to go out when it’s too hot, **Takeaway is also very convenient. Compared with the five-star hotels in Yalong Bay, Sheraton is still good, and I will choose Sheraton next time.

I liked the garden design of the Sheraton very much last time I stayed. It has a tropical rainforest style in Southeast Asia, with tall and lush trees. The low-rise sea view room I stayed in before was blocked, so I suggest going higher.
The size of the suite is large enough, and the panoramic terrace has a panoramic view. It is enough for two children to run around. Personally, I feel that the area is far higher than other new Internet celebrity hotels or hotels that focus on parent-child at the same price. As the oldest five-star hotel in Yalong Bay, Sheraton has a profound heritage, the hardware is a bit outdated but the hygiene is in place.
The double dross vinegar hot pot that is given is very large, and the ingredients are quite fresh.
The service is positive and responsive, which is great.
Next time I come to Yalong Bay, I will consider staying again.

I couldn’t get through to the room customer many times, and the response was very slow. There were even cases where the service staff opened the lock and entered by themselves without knocking. House, really feel speechless. The entire check-in experience makes people feel that the hotel management is utilitarian and there is no warmth at all. It is really far worse than the feeling of staying here ten years ago. It is so disappointing. In addition, if you are bringing children, this hotel is obviously not suitable for parent-child travel in winter. There are very few activities for children, only a small pool of a few square meters for swimming, and nothing else. I will never choose this hotel brand again in the future. Although they are all owned by Marriott, I hope other brands will be different.

Everyone, both young and old, were very satisfied. In addition, I would like to commend Xiaowei, the concierge, for remembering my car needs after a few days. He is very service-minded and was very considerate in the final airport drop-off arrangements. Although the hotel facilities are a bit old and the air conditioning is not very sufficient, the service and scenery are really great. I will come again.

The hotel has lush vegetation and many swimming pools, suitable for children of different ages to play. It's beautiful to take pictures casually, and the beach is also good. The Thai-style buffet barbecue by the sea is highly recommended for dinner. That is, the taste and variety of breakfast generally need to be improved.

msg:The originally booked poolside room was fortunately upgraded to a poolside suite. Although I didn't check in until after 5 o'clock, it was worth the wait.
This room has its own small yard and private small swimming pool, which is also very close to the large swimming pool, so it is easy to enter and exit. Taking pictures with babies in this private swimming pool is very popular, and it is also a very pleasant surprise. Many beautiful photos are just inconvenient to put up. The room in the suite is big enough with a living room, and it is very comfortable for two adults and two children. We didn't have an extra bed. Dad slept on the sofa bed. He didn't say he was uncomfortable🤣😬, and he was super satisfied with his stay at the Sheraton. The hotel is also very convenient to go to the beach. But it is true that the sand in Yalong Bay is not as fine as before😭. Although it's on the first floor, it doesn't feel damp. There are still mosquitoes in the small yard, but we are still calm and accept it. After staying for two nights and going home, the four-year-old couldn't bear to cry😭.
We stayed at Tianyu for two nights before staying at the Sheraton. In comparison, Tianyu is more lively and family-friendly, but including the room, the overall environment and service of the hotel is still better than the Sheraton (maybe the adults hope that it will not be too noisy and clean haha). The breakfast is generally okay. I don’t have any requirements for eating to lose weight. The dining area for the dolls also has a small landscape. 😬
A few years ago, I also stayed at the Sheraton here for company events, and the old-fashioned hotel is still trustworthy.
Next time I come, I will continue to consider staying at the Sheraton, and I also want to live in a pool suite, hehe 😁

msg:I did a lot of strategy before I came, and finally chose Sheraton, because I prefer the color tone of the room. Although many people complain about the old days, I don't think so. Maybe I personally prefer this style with a little American country style. Modern styles are actually more likely to become outdated. The hotel lobby is very grand and stylish, and the waiters have a very good attitude. I can give it five stars! In the last two days, we directly continued to live in a full sea view room. The view of the sea view room is average, because it is blocked by the garden, but the light is very good. There are only two disadvantages. One is that there are not many play facilities for children, which is more suitable for business and leisure. The second is that the breakfast is really unpalatable! ! !

At that time, the Sheraton had just been built a year ago, and it was no less popular among the many luxury hotels in Yalong Bay. But when we meet again 18 years later, apart from memories, I can only say that the Sheraton is old. Although the facilities are better than those in the nearby mangrove forest and the rooms are big enough, the lack of intention is probably the biggest regret.

Although the hardware of the hotel is a bit old, the overall style is still there, and it is very beautiful if you take a photo casually!

The weather in the past two days is also awesome, and the jelly sea is visible to the naked eye! It is suitable for "bad" in the hotel 😏 either soaking in the beach 🏖️ or soaking in the water every day! The hotel has a lot of activities every day, which is very suitable for taking children on vacation ~ Unfortunately, the children's water park has not been completed during maintenance in the past two days ~ Save some thoughts and think about coming again next time! 😝ps It is also good that there are drying racks on each balcony!

We also tried the Chinese restaurant and the Western restaurant one by one. The portion is large and the taste is also very good. A family of three can eat the 398 Chinese set meal support. The hotel also provides a free shuttle bus to the duty-free shop. Although I didn't go there, the service is very good. When you stay in the hotel, you will get five travel photos for free. This experience is also very good, and it satisfies the desire to take a beautiful family portrait. The hotel also has a home delivery service for fruits and special products, which is also very considerate! There is also a business center where children's homework can be printed for free!

After the staff found out, they put several floor towels in the room and bathroom, which has a good anti-slip effect. Second, my bracelet may have been left somewhere in the room or on the bed. When we came back from outings, it was already quietly lying on the conspicuous table. I have to admire the care of the staff. Three, the staff at the door will help to pick up the luggage, help open and close the door, and ask if there is any luggage in the trunk that needs to be moved, or ask if you need to call a taxi when you go out. Every small detail is more warm.

Swimming pool, beach fun, satisfied.
I booked a supreme sea view room, but I don’t know where the supreme is. Looking out from the balcony, half of the line of sight is blocked by the front room.
There are actually not many parent-child activities. Except for some small activities on the beach, there is nothing else. The children's amu*****t park is too small, so I don't recommend it. What about the small train?
The breakfast is quite rich, better than expected, with all the basic dishes, that's why the cups are never enough, and there is no waiter to bring them out.
The worst experience is the air conditioner in the room, it is too loud and the cooling effect is poor!

The breakfast is also very rich. It is worth mentioning that there is a special dining area for children, which is very suitable for children.

In the evening, there are foreign resident singers in the hotel lobby. The price of the hotel is very reasonable. Most of the cocktails cost 88 yuan for a glass.
Turn left out of the hotel and there is a Dongrong food court. The night market has barbecue seafood, tea restaurants and bars. We went to the Dongrong Hainan private kitchen on the third floor. The taste is very good.
Overall, the experience of staying in this hotel is very good, and the staff are also very enthusiastic. When swimming, they even offered to let us play water shooting, and we will cheer together when we score goals. It's awesome.

Hygiene: clean and tidy
Facilities: It is an old star hotel, so there will inevitably be traces, but it will not affect the accommodation. The disadvantage is that the toilet will always have a bad smell, and it is recommended to improve it. In addition, the hair dryer is too old, and it gets hot after a short period of time, which is a safety hazard. It is recommended to improve it. I arrived a few days before May Day, and the flow of people is not too much, but the check-in time at the front desk is too long. It is recommended to send more people to help guests register. It would be better if the breakfast types were more diverse.
Let me talk about the details of my personal experience. There will be a trash can for oversized garbage next to the elevator on the housing floor. It is very good. It is convenient to dispose of the takeaway garbage after ordering food, so as not to leave a smell in the room. There is no one who has stayed in a certain star resort hotel in Haitang Bay before. This is a good job. In addition, the mineral water in the room will be replenished in time, so that drinking water will not be delayed, which is very good.
After check-out, the hotel peggy zeng will call back in time to understand the accommodation experience, which is very good. I hope that the comments raised can be properly handled. Overall, the accommodation for the past few days is very comfortable and considerate. It is very convenient to travel around, eat, drink and have fun. Personally, I think it is better than living in Haitang Bay. I will consider staying again in the future.

msg:Because of the epidemic, the travel plan with parents has been put on hold for many years. Before leaving, I spent a lot of time comparing and comparing. Finally, I chose an old-fashioned hotel. I thought it would be more reliable. It turned out to be right. My parents had a great time and lived very comfortably.
The hotel is indeed a bit old, but it is very clean and the room is spacious and bright enough. It was a bit troublesome to book two days apart. The front desk helped me merge the rooms and upgraded the room type. I introduced it patiently
The garden is very beautiful and the lawn is really beautiful. The garden design is almost one step at a time. My parents played for half a day just taking pictures, and I was reluctant to leave. A few swimming pools are enough for fun. I even made an appoin**ent for a paddle board experience.
There are activities on the lawn in the afternoon, buffet in the evening, and bubble parties on the beach
Strolling directly from the hotel to the beach, the sand is just as everyone said, the newly filled ones are very sticky, but the sea water in Yalong Bay is still beautiful and clear, and it is very comfortable to swim in the evening
There are resident singers in the lobby at night, listening to songs. The Yaochi dining bar for breakfast is indeed open, so Suguo is afraid of the heat and will feel a little uncomfortable. But we go to eat earlier and there is a bit of cool breeze. It feels very comfortable to look directly at the sea.
Special thanks to Xiao Xie from the concierge depar**ent for introducing us to our luggage and helping us with water. He is serious and considerate
Leave very good memories, it is a hotel worth coming again

msg:The old five-star hotel has facilities, services, and various equipment online. The sea view location is also excellent. There are many swimming pools, and there are many things to play. Going to the hotel is not boring. It is also very convenient to order takeaways. The breakfast is rich and can satisfy all kinds of needs. Require. After looking at the cultural wall on the first floor, I realized that in 2008 and 2013, the hotel was used as a state guest hotel to receive foreign heads of state for state affairs. Do you think it can be bad? Of course, there are still some problems. The luxury sea view is upgraded to the exclusive sea view. The room faces the sea, but the floor is low, so the longitudinal area of the sea view is not large. After the floor of the room is wet, it is still quite slippery, so the elderly should be extra careful. The infirmary does not have standing medicines for heat stroke and mosquito bites, only iodophor and other trauma medicines, which I hope can be improved. Moreover, the front desk does not know enough about the functions of the infirmary, so it is unable to answer the guests' questions in the first place.

I was worried that the hotel would be open for a long time. In fact, I was too worried. The sanitation and facility maintenance are very good, and the hotel is very a**ospheric , It’s super convenient to go to the beach. The hotel helped to upgrade the sea view suite. The 118-square-meter invincible sea view is so cool. The mood is so good. There are not as many people as expected on May Day. It’s really a profit! The room is equipped with children's toiletries, small slippers and a small toilet, which is very considerate. The concierge, Xie Xiaoyang, took great care of us, helping us with things at any time, providing various travel suggestions, and even giving gifts to the children. The baby was very happy, saying that this is my home in Hainan 😅 It will be my first choice next time

The lobby is very transparent and bright, and the room is super big. You can choose to keep the air conditioner on all the time. After playing outside, the room is super cool, and you feel comfortable immediately!
Before coming here, I wanted a room with a good view from the balcony on the phone, which is really awesome! I read the article before and said that the interior is old, but I didn't feel it at all, but I thought it was a kind of charm of time!
The breakfast is super rich! Meet the characteristics of people from different places! The breakfast room is also great! That's why I chose this hotel on Monday! Open restaurant, enjoy breakfast accompanied by green plants, fine water and good air!
Not to mention the beach! Walking along the beach to the beach of MGM next door, the beach of Sheraton is really much more delicate! I was still struggling with Sheraton and MGM before, but I was a little disappointed when I went to MGM. There are a lot of coral and shellfish on the beach. The hotel style is modern and simple, but it has no special features!
The location of the hotel is also super convenient. It is very convenient to go to Wuzhizhou Island and Forest Park. After going to Wuzhizhou Island, just stop by the international duty-free shop!
The whole itinerary is to play all the places you want to go, buy and buy, and enjoy the beautiful beach! Perfect!

Arrived after two o'clock in the afternoon, check-in was quick and there was no queue, and the luggage was delivered to the room without hands. I took my baby to stay. The twin beds were put together into a 3-meter bed, and a 3-meter mattress and 1.8-meter bed fence were specially added. This is really amazing, and the baby can roll around on the bed with confidence. The hotel's buffet breakfast is very rich. There is actually a Hefu lo mein window, and the Hainan noodles are also delicious. You can drink refreshments, and the fruits are also very fresh and diverse. When traveling with a baby, I am most concerned about whether the baby is having fun. The hotel has a lot of children's activities, which are different every day. Brother Fu Shaoguang, who is in charge of the activities, is handsome and nice. He is very enthusiastic about the baby. He takes the baby to participate in the activities and is eager to help us Answering questions made me feel the service attitude and level of a five-star hotel. The huge lawn is next to the beach, and the photos are super beautiful. The seaside barbecue dinner is also very good, and the a**osphere is super good. Although others say that the hotel is not new enough, I think the overall style is elegant, simple, comfortable and natural. Next time I come to Sanya, I will continue to choose the Sheraton. This time I only stayed for three days and I feel that it is not enough.

Ctrip can offer group tickets, which are very favorable, but you have to book three days in advance😂It’s a pity, I missed it. We ordered individually. The hotel has multiple free swimming pools, and also gives away five travel photos, as well as duty-free shop coupons, and a ticket for a scenic spot. There are discounts for the hotel’s activities. There is a beach behind, and lifeguards are there 24 hours a day. The photos are beautiful, and the children also like the free train every day. The sea view room is as shown in the picture, you can watch the sunrise directly, as long as the room card starts with 1. Also, thanks to the waiter Chen Liuliu, who planned the trip for us very carefully!

After coming here, it really did not disappoint. According to online reviews, the facilities here are a bit outdated. To be honest, the hotel dream that has been open for 20 years is already quite good. The style of the hotel is magnificent, beautiful and high-end, and has a rich heritage, which is beyond the reach of many high-end hotels. The room is very clean and tidy, the lawn is very good, and the plants in the whole park are very beautiful. No wonder it was chosen to host the Asia Summit here. In addition, there are a lot of parent-child projects. Every day, the staff carry out parent-child games on the lawn and beach, and the children are very happy. Although the breakfast is not so brilliant, it is also rich. The most worth mentioning is that the service of the staff is very good. Aunt Wang Shaoling, who forgot to bring the hair tie for the child, gave her own to the child, and even brought a box of new ones for the child the next day.

msg:The price is more than 3,000 during the National Day, and the experience is extremely poor, extremely poor, extremely poor! The summary is old! break! old! I have been to Sanya three times and this is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. Feeling very irritable
The first choice is that the water in the wash basin is not flowing smoothly, the air conditioner does not work, and the child took off his pajamas in the middle of the night because of the heat, and his hair was wet from the heat. The room is actually not as cool as the corridor outside!
Second, there is not even a charging place beside the bed, which is rare.
Third, the bed creaks when I sit on it, which is also very annoying. The pillows were also uncomfortable, and overall I had a sore back at the end of the night. The next day, I felt sleepy and not in good spirits. I yawned all the time.
Fourth, there wasn’t even a handbag in the room. Comes with only plastic bags.
I regretted booking this hotel. I checked out at 10 o'clock the next day and left.

msg:The reason why I chose Sheraton after searching online for a long time is because of the good service, and the reputation is really well-deserved after I came here. From the first day of check-in, anny and Xiao Zhou have been very responsible, and every little brother in the concierge depar**ent has a very good attitude! The hotel will provide children with special bathrobes, toiletries, and small slippers for children. Whenever a call is made, it is dealt with immediately. Every staff member will take the initiative to say hello when they meet. We chose the pool room this time. The room will be humid when you enter, but it will be better if you ask for a dehumidifier. I stayed for three days in total, and I didn't feel any discomfort! The room was also kept clean. The waiter Chen Bingxin left a note for me and took a small towel for the child to fold the small animals. There are many parent-child activities in the hotel! We basically didn't leave the hotel for these three days. Next time you come to Sanya, Sheraton will be your first choice. The slight disadvantage is that the facilities in the room are a bit old. Looking forward to better future.

I have been to Sanya 4 times, and I personally feel that none of the attractions are worth visiting. The Sheraton Hotel is really fun. The hotel gave away tickets to various scenic spots, duty-free shop coupons, taking photos, small trains, and surfboards are all free. There are also many attractions in the park, which are suitable for children to play. The swimming pool is also very clear, and there are various swimming pools suitable for different ages. We played the children's competition and won a 300 yuan dinner voucher. It was like a free meal. The authentic open fire Wenchang chicken was so delicious. It was so comfortable to have dinner on the beach. There was also a resident singer in the lobby at night. The hotel garden is large and beautiful, and the private beach is sparsely populated with clear water. Yalong Bay is the best beach in Sanya. It is worthy of being the best bay in the world. I am very satisfied and have good memories with my children.

Knowing that we live in a large number of people, she takes the initiative to help us merge the beds, install the bed fence, and clean the house. Secondly, there are many types of breakfast. There are 2 places to eat, and there is no need to queue up. The place on the first floor is full of people, so you can also come to the second floor to eat. The scenery in the hotel is also very good, no matter where you take pictures from, it is very beautiful. During the period, I watched a wedding held here, full of happiness. The temperature of the children's pool is relatively moderate, and the children played in it for two afternoons. In short, this is a very satisfying stay, and I will choose here again next time.

The cute parent-child suite I live in is at the end of the corridor, a bit tired, but the room is really nice. Small tents, deer dolls, terrace bathtubs and swimming pools are all baby favorites. I love the independent beach, direct access to the sea, and the outdoor constant-temperature infinity pool. I love the paddling pool. The paddling pool is a place for children to check in. The breakfast is very rich, and the roast chicken buffet at night is especially good. The room cleaners are very dedicated, and the duty manager Tiget and the mandarin ducks in the guest service center are the icing on the cake. I heard that the baby fell and gave a small gift, and the clothes I left behind were also arranged to be washed and sent back. All in all, I am very satisfied with this stay.

msg:I stayed at the Sheraton Yalong Bay 6 or 7 years ago, and this time, I still think that this hotel is suitable for the price. So ignored the negative reviews online and booked this hotel. The itinerary is 4 days and 3 nights. The overall feeling is still the same as before, and it is a very satisfying leisure experience. It should be said that the quality control of Sheraton has not changed for so many years, and the heart will calm down in this hotel, and there is a strong sense of vacation. Let me talk about the service first. The staff are polite and enthusiastic. The manager Li Xiaoyan in the lobby is very caring. While handling various affairs, he also tried his best to help us meet the request for a room with a sea view angle. I asked a dedicated waiter to show me the room. Thank you very much 🙏 Concierge Ah Fu's service is very good. The young man is tall, gentle and enthusiastic. He helped me with my luggage, showed us the room, and answered every question patiently. Special praise! Also, Wu Weicong, the waiter who cleaned the room, was very careful when cleaning the room. Please see the picture for details, and I would like to thank you very much! Let's talk about the hardware. I read that many people in the comments say that the hotel is old or something, but I don't think so. When I came here before, I was thinking that the style of decoration and the use of materials should be considered in order to resist the hot and humid environment in the south. It is estimated that it will be like this in more than ten years. Now I come back and look at it. That's right! Especially in the lobby and the room, the smell is very good. It really smells like a vacation. People who like lively people may not like it, but people like me who like to be quiet, relax, and slow down will especially like it. the vibe. Five or six swimming pools, a gym, a comfortable room with buckwheat skin pillows, a large lawn where you can walk everywhere, and the most beautiful beach in Yalong Bay, isn't that enough? This time, I also found that there have been great changes. Children's entertainment facilities have increased, and a complimentary travel photo has been added. At first, I also thought why the price of this hotel has dropped? Going the kitsch route too? After careful tasting, I realized that after all, there are many new hotels now, and the small videos of Internet celebrities are popular, and more parents travel with their children, so they must cater to mainstream customers. We originally said that we didn’t want to travel and shoot, but after thinking about it, we went to shoot... Then we must talk about the breakfast. The breakfast here is really the same as it was a few years ago, and it is still so delicious! There are so many tricks that I haven’t eaten them all in three days, and the sea breeze can be blown naturally, and some large benches seem to be built on the water, which is very comfortable. The waiter gave the child a big bag of snacks when he was doing the accommodation experience survey, and immediately sent our suggestions to the work group to solve them, full of sincerity! It's a pity that the dripping cliff of the restaurant is no longer dripping. The last thing I want to say is that although we traveled off-peak, we still didn’t choose a good time. It’s still not suitable for going into the water at the beginning of the month. The wind is too strong, and the constant temperature swimming pool is also ridiculous. There is always a time when the water comes out, right? It will blow your heart out in an instant! It's better to come in April or May next time.

For the same price, staying in Haitang Bay or Sanya Bay is better than this hotel. It's full of teams, and tour groups, it's a trap. Not worth the price of 1800. I will never come again. I booked for two days, and negotiated with Ctrip to cancel the next day. Even if you want to make a reservation, you must first look at the room and then decide! If it is for the beach, feel free. The beach is cleaner than Sanya Bay, quieter than Haitang Bay, and the wind and waves are not so big. Gone. In this way, the experience is very poor.

msg:This is the second time I stayed at the Sheraton. The last time I went was several years ago. I was worried that the hotel facilities were too old and uncomfortable, but when I arrived, I realized that I was too worried. Although the decoration style is outdated, everything is very clean comfortable. The two-night stay booked by Ctrip includes one lunch and one dinner. Although the meals are average, they can basically be full.
The highlight of Sheraton has always been the environment and service. The lawn at the entrance of the lobby is super photogenic, and you don’t need a filter to take a photo; the beach, which can be reached within a few minutes of walking, is a must-see every day. You can check in the Internet celebrity’s love pit photos, and you won’t be afraid of getting tanned when you take pictures and play in the water 😂 Still very satisfied with the stay experience
I recommend everyone to go!

I didn't want to make a fuss and chose to stay at the Sheraton in Yalong Bay for 4 nights, but ended up changing rooms for two consecutive nights. Fortunately, at the last moment, the butler, Xiao Du, showed the professionalism and sincerity that a five-star hotel should have to ease the situation👍.
ps: The 5-star praise is given to Ronaldinho at the concierge depar**ent. He is attentive, warm, gentle and polite. He has offered help to me and my children many times in a timely manner. Thank you very much!

Although the room facilities are a bit old, they are well cleaned. The room is spacious and the bathroom is a bit small. Personally, I think the quilt on the bed is thin. The hotel can prepare a medium-thin quilt and put it in the cabinet to meet the needs of different guests. The overall a**osphere of the hotel is refreshing, the lawn is beautiful, and there are multiple swimming pools to meet the needs of different groups of people, which is very good! The hotel has a private beach, it is very convenient to watch the sea and play in the sea! Good service attitude, polite hotel staff! Breakfast is not bad. Overall a good experience!

The beach is very close to the swimming pool. The water quality of Yalong Bay is much better than that of Coconut Dream Corridor.
Later, I went to the lake and reef view room. I did not expect that the overall room is also very good. Below is the swimming pool. You can see a little sea view from a distance, and you can also see the sunrise in the morning.
We visited several hotels in the nearby Yalong Bay, and felt that the lobby of the Sheraton is very high-end, magnificent, and there are resident singers at night, which is quite lively. The barbecue by the hotel's beach also tastes good, the grilled chicken is absolutely amazing. Living here will feel like a vacation.
And the most worth mentioning is that I really feel that every service staff in the hotel has a very good attitude, and they really listen to the needs of customers seriously and try their best to meet your requirements, which is great.
Overall, it must be well received. After all, it is the hotel where we held our wedding. We will definitely come back if we have a chance in the future.

The water gun battle in the swimming pool and the bubble show on the beach are the baby's favorites. In addition, the beach is equipped with lifeguards from the hotel, which gave me the courage to take my baby to try swimming with a swimming ring on the beach for the first time, and the child had a great time.
2 small suggestions, one is: install 1-2 more shower heads and shower heads near the beach of the hotel, otherwise the queuing time for washing will be longer during peak hours.
2. The washbasin is really small and old. It is recommended to replace it with a larger washbasin.

I thought I could experience the beauty of a five-star hotel. After all, the price of more than 2,000 yuan per night is not low, but I never expected that the reality is as bad as the hope. 1. I booked a Premier Deluxe Sea View Room. The room I arranged had a musty smell and the view of the sea was not good. It was not worthy of the title of Premier Deluxe Sea View Room. 2. Under my strong opinion, the hotel finally gave me another room, but the room was not worth the musty smell, and the room phone didn't work. Have to go to the front desk to reflect. 3. The safe in the room is broken and cannot be used at all, it is purely a decoration. 4. I wanted to charge my phone at the bedside at night, but I never expected that the jack was out of power! ! No way, I tried the sockets one by one, and finally the socket of the kettle had electricity. It reminds me of the saying "there is no worst, only worse"! 5. I thought that if the breakfast is good, I will not talk about it. I did not expect that the breakfast in the Sheraton five-star hotel is not as rich as the breakfast in the Guoguang Howard Johnson Hotel. What a disappoin**ent!
I want to reflect these actual conditions, and hope that consumers can avoid pitfalls as much as possible when booking enough hotels, at least the hotel's software and hardware can afford its price! I hope you can live in a hygienic, comfortable and convenient hotel when you come to Sanya!

So the difference between the five-star hotel and the resorts next door is reflected in these details.

When I booked, it was clearly stated that I could check in at 15:00. When I checked out, it happened that the plane was delayed. , the child is still young, whether the coordination can extend the check-out until 3 o'clock, if I don't agree, I just want to ask, the hotel itself has violated the contract (broken my promise) by not allowing me to check in at 15:00, according to the reason, I paid the room fee for one day It must be 24 hours. Sheraton will not resolve its breach of contract and requires guests to check out by 14:00 at the latest! In addition, no one reminded me of any experience in the package. I don’t recommend staying again. I have stayed in so many five-star hotels in Yalong Bay. Sheraton disappointed me. I think it is the hotel with the worst service in Yalong Bay!

Yalong Bay compared many hotels on Ctrip, and finally chose Sheraton, which is really good. The room is spacious and the facilities are relatively new. The hygiene of the main room is very clean. The welcome brother and the room service staff are all very good. The environment of the hotel is very good, there are several swimming pools, you can go to them, there is no charge, the swimming pool is a bit cold, and towels are provided. From the room, you can walk directly from the hotel to the beach. There is a shaded pergola on the beach, and you can lie down and watch the sea. There will be fruit sellers coming over to sell fruit and cold drinks. The price is slightly higher than outside, but it is acceptable . The hotel also has restaurants, but the prices may be relatively high. I didn’t dine at the hotel this time, but the consumption in the entire Yalong Bay is relatively high, because this is a tourist area😀 The overall feeling of staying in the hotel this time is still very good, and the hotel service is still good. Just returned to my city, the hotel staff called to give a good review, and I also wanted to give a good review, it just happened to coincide, this trip to Sanya is also very good, it is worth going again

msg:The hotel is very good. It is indeed the first listed five-star hotel in Yalong Bay, and the front desk manager Lesley handled the problems encountered during the check-in very well. On the first day of check-in, we arranged a connecting room type. Due to the full room during the Spring Festival, we did not change it. The room, after communicating with Lesley, I was decisively upgraded to a full sea view room on the seventh floor the next day. The room is located in a good position, and you can see the greenery and sea view of the entire park. Thank you very much for Lesley's coordinated efforts and dedication to work. In the past, I felt that the hotels in Yalong Bay were a bit old, and most of them lived in Haitang Bay. This time, the children wanted to play some marine sports such as motorboats, so they booked the Sheraton Yalong Bay. The actual results also proved that this decision was very correct. The environment of the hotel park is very good, designed by masters, the pavilions and pavilions are beautifully designed, there are many recreational items on the beach, and the heated swimming pool is also good. You can enjoy the seaside scenery while swimming. It feels good to stay for a few days. Next time I come to Sanya, I will still stay at Sheraton Yalong Bay.

msg:The service of the hotel is polarized, and the restaurant rooms are so-so. The staff in the lobby bar seem to be lazy, hiding to chat without solving the problem. Fortunately, the problem was finally solved.
The hotel's external environment and swimming pool facilities are good. The adult underwater vehicle is a highlight, and the children had a great time.
I especially want to complain about the internal environment of the hotel: 1. The corridors on all floors of the hotel are dimly lit; 2. With the dim lights, there is a smell of damp and kitchen waste in the corridors, which is really from above; in short, the dim lights +Bad smell+Long corridors, spooky and scary😱 It's also strange, don't the staff clean the carpets in the corridors? 3. What I want to complain the most is the hotel's wifi. It feels like the same wireless network is used by the Marriott next door, the speed is not only slow, but also very stuck. The videos posted by WeChat Fat Circle cannot be browsed normally, and it takes a while to download before they can be played normally. Telephone conferences and video conferences can only rely on mobile data.

(If you don’t engage in such tricks, you may really have no business.) I booked it for the water bouncy castle, but there was no room. The facilities and equipment in the room are outdated. Our room has a hotel-provided charging head. Why? Because the socket at the head of the bed is broken! As a result, the charger didn't even work! The walls of the bathroom are covered with mold stains that cannot be wiped off. The water in the bathtub is fast. I checked out after 9:00 in the morning. I checked in at another hotel after 4:00 in the afternoon. They still haven’t checked us out from the public security system, so I couldn’t check in to another hotel. This is my third visit to Sanya and I’ve stayed in a dozen different hotels. This is the worst!

There is a beach in front of the hotel, and the children have a great time digging sand there every day. There are several swimming pools in the hotel. The eldest son swims twice a day, and then takes his younger sister to the hotel. We played in the gym, claw machine, singing machine, and children's playground. We also had a good time.
        I originally wanted to give a good review, but it happened that my daughter left her phone and watch at the hotel when she was leaving, and the exact place where it was left has been blurred. We didn't find out until after a day, and we contacted after 10 o'clock in the evening. Thank you to Wendy, the little fairy in the guest service center, who took the trouble to help us search everywhere, follow up in time, and finally found it in the children's playground. It was really troublesome for her during the Chinese New Year, and it made our guests feel warm. And Lesley, the manager on duty, also actively responded to us, thank you!
        In addition, I found that the extra bed was not expensive, so I immediately drove my eldest son to sleep in the extra bed, and the extra bed was not a small stretch spring bed, but a big wooden bed, which was very comfortable. Good value for money!
        In short, the children said that they will come to live in the future, that is the best evaluation and affirmation, and we also feel that the details in all aspects are indeed in place!

More importantly, there is no overly commercial operation. The whole courtyard has a quiet, leisurely and elegant feeling. ￼Breakfast is good, and the food quality of Baiyun Chinese Restaurant is comparable to that of a hotel. ￼If you don’t go out, you can have lunch and dinner in the Chinese restaurant. The food is exquisite and delicious, and the most important thing is that you don’t feel dirty. ￼Of course, the service of the hotel does need to be improved, the facilities are relatively old￼, and the quality of the toiletries is mediocre.

The facilities are somewhat outdated, but overall they are pretty good. I stayed for one more night. Praise 👍

Thanks to the hotel for upgrading me to a sea view room and extending the check-out time. Thank you very much for the care and care of the hotel staff!

msg:Facilities: The facilities are quite complete, and the details are considered comprehensively. The only suggestion: In the gym or other places, set up a private shower + changing room, which will be much more convenient for guests leaving the hotel to continue playing in the water in the afternoon. There is a fruit shop on the first floor. If you want to buy special products and fruits, you can send them by mail, which is very nice. The second floor is an outsourced travel photography shop. Friends who like to take pictures can pay attention to it. Price reference: We booked 5 free photos, and the extra 30 or 588 packs are not bargained.


Hygiene: The standard of an old five-star hotel is still acceptable.

Location & Environment: Close to the beach, there are multiple swimming pools, the night market is 300 meters to the left of the door, and it takes 15 minutes by taxi to Tropical Paradise Rainforest Park (If You Are the One II).

Service: The service attitude and quality of the staff are very good, and I feel very good.

In general, the old five-star hotel, although the room facilities and decoration are a bit old, but the quality of service and the integrity of the facilities are really good~ The price is much friendlier than other hotels in the same period, and I will consider staying again in the future~

Although the hotel is old, the hardware facilities are up to standard, the room is spacious, the bed is very comfortable, and the sofa can be used as a single bed for children. The service is warm and thoughtful, and the response is fast, especially Xiaoxie, the luggage porter, who took the initiative to introduce us to the daily activities of the hotel and gave us a fruit plate.
The scenery of the park is beautiful, typical Southeast Asian style, very a**ospheric. Eyes full of blue eyes, I have been soaking in the hotel for three days, going to the sea every day, participating in the hotel paddle board, Frisbee, and the travel photography is also beautiful, in short, everything is very satisfactory.
It takes more than 10 minutes to walk to the Baihuagu business district. It is very good to go out after dinner.

I especially like the waiter Xiaoxie who helped me with my luggage. He is enthusiastic and talkative. In addition, it is recommended that the hotel strictly manage the store operators in the hotel, because from the outsiders' perspective, the operators of these stores also represent the integrity and image of the hotel from a certain point of view. This refers specifically to the relationship between the hotel lobby and guest rooms. In the fruit shop in the aisle corridor, I picked the ripest mango with all yellow skin and handed it to the merchant for weighing and immediately paid for it on WeChat. The merchant immediately put the mango into a small compar**ent for one meal , I can only see the back of this merchant but I don’t know what he is doing, so I told this merchant that I don’t need to pack the mangoes for me, but the merchant told me that he had already peeled and cut the mangoes for me. The mangoes I picked were ripe and yellow, but when I saw a box of diced mangoes brought out by the merchant, they were slightly blue in color with clear water chestnuts, so I understood what was going on.

On the first day after arriving at the hotel, the child was playing with their hotel's project ~ the beach car was halfway accompanied by the staff, and the child was left there alone to drive, causing the child to be injured. The purpose of bringing a child here is to embrace the beach and the sea. After staying for five days, the child’s wound was still bleeding, and he dared not play in the water even once. The hotel’s handling method from the beginning to the end was to refund the 100 yuan for the child to play the project. We came to Sanya once, and we never got into the water once, so we couldn’t go anywhere, so we just stayed in the room

msg:These hotels in Sanya vow to use this vacation to recover the losses of three years. They were going to Lingshui, but they stayed in Yalong Bay due to the weather. This upgrade routine comforts the injured heart. The mattress in the room at around 2000 per night has been in service for more than ten years. It sinks in the middle when you lie down. When you turn over, the sound of the mattress is enough to wake you up from sleep. , Waking up with low back pain in the morning.
The facilities and equipment in the room are all from the 1990s. It’s not an exaggeration. Whoever uses it will know. If you want to go to the bathroom at night, you have to find the switch in the dark. It’s not even as good as an express hotel. It’s only three or four hundred for a different location. For one night, it really took advantage of the right time and place.
Breakfast is also "very attentive", very average, very rubbish
Even so, everyone still has to line up one after another to pay the bill. This is the reality.
Who can be blamed if you come across this message?

msg:The third night of our trip to Sanya chose the Sheraton Yalong Bay, compared to the Haitang Bay Shangri-La we stayed in for the first two nights. After comparing it, I regretted not continuing to stay in Shangri-La. Let me talk about the gap: 1. Service initiative. We drove to the lobby without guidance. I took the luggage by myself, and I waited in the lobby for a while before someone came to help with the luggage. 2. Lack of parent-child facilities, no footstools, no night lights in the room, it is really inconvenient to bring children. 3. Parent-child activities are delayed, we live I participated in 2 activities in one night, and none of them started on time. 4. Due to the summer vacation, there are a lot of children, and it is very noisy at night. This is actually a quality issue. The only thing that can win is that it is more convenient to eat. The food court is a 5-minute walk from the hotel. The breakfast variety is also more abundant. In addition, the beach of Yalong Bay is really not as good as Haitang Bay. The sand is thicker and mixed with broken shells. There is also a layer of floating on the sea. Trash. In summary, as two hotels with the same price, I will choose Shangri-La in the future

He also said that he wanted to send me fruit to apologize, but no one came to deliver the fruit during the two nights in the hotel. It was not because of the lack of fruit. As a five-star hotel, it did not believe what it said, and it was ridiculous to rely on mouth-to-mouth service.

Although the solid wood decoration of the old hotel has a sense of age, it does not affect the exquisite a**osphere.
The elder sister on duty in Parent-Child Paradise today is the baby’s favorite. Thank you for your love and care. The baby still has good memories when it’s too cold to swim.

The brothers in the concierge depar**ent should be the first brothers in Yalong Bay👍🏻Thank you for your care!

msg:Because the Yalong Bay Hotel is very old, I stayed at the Hilton before. This time I was entangled with the Sheraton or the MGM. The MGM score is higher. The MGM is a little disappointed. First, the service is not warm and waits for a long time. Second, it is dirty except for the atrium corridor and the elevator. Everywhere is dirty. The old rooms are even weirder. Most of the big bed rooms are across the building with poor privacy. The corridors are very narrow and the carpet is dirty. The rooms are old. When I came to the Sheraton, the young man at the concierge was very nice. He took me to see the rooms and looked at them several times. The lobby of the Sheraton is open to Southeast Asia. The garden is so beautiful. The swimming pool is large and small. The hidden room is sunny and facing the sea. It is just in time for the birthday. I had breakfast early in the morning and sent cakes and sang blessings. I was so moved and decided to continue staying for 2 days.

The waiters are generally friendly, the rooms are clean, and the gardens are beautiful.
There are also many restaurants around, the seafood city and supermarket next door are very convenient, and there are many options for ordering takeaways.
The outdoor swimming pool is also very clean, a plus.
Next time I have a chance, I will consider their home.

When you check in, all the waiters you meet will say hello.
The room space is very large, but the facilities are really old, there will be some smell, and there are no intelligent facilities. Fortunately it was clean. There is no mosquito repellent in the room, which is lacking.
The lobby is very stylish, and I like the style. This time I live in the west wing, and I can see the sunrise in the morning, and the scenery is really good. There are many green plants in the hotel, and I also saw picking coconuts.
There are also many swimming pools in the hotel, most of which are open. It is also convenient to walk to the beach.
There are many varieties of breakfast. Although the restaurant is open, it is not too hot and not in the sun. Looking at the pool and listening to the sound of the water, it is very comfortable to eat and eat.
The hotel has a nucleic acid point, so you need to pay attention to the time.
It's very convenient to eat nearby, but because of the epidemic, you need to go to the lobby to pick up take-out.
The service of Alina at the front desk is very good. Overall, it is a good stay experience.

msg:This is my second stay at the Sheraton. A few years ago, I was planted on the Internet and stayed in parent-child hotels such as MGM Tianyu. This time I chose to return to the Sheraton for a long stay. The biggest reason is the garden. It feels that it has been imitated by all the first-line hotels in Yalong Bay and has never been surpassed. Southeast Asian a**osphere, every step is a blockbuster. The second reason is that the hotel's beach is really quieter than other hotels. (You know, some people like to yell, like those released from prison, hysterical, extremely excited...It affects the mood of the holiday) Thirdly, the service here is really warm, the lobby of the car, a smell The a**osphere of Southeast Asia is blowing in my face. I really like the clothes of the brothers in the lobby and the front hall. The feeling of the tropics is full
There were a lot of surprises this time, and my daughter got a birthday cake for her birthday. Jason, the recreation manager, is really nice. He really thinks what you think. Do you want to be a train? Go coconut picking? Uncle taught you how to swim... the little introverted baby had fun before he knew it. When I went upstairs to work for a while, Ms. Hu Qiao from Children's World had a great time playing with the children. It was really hard work to bend over to help the baby make dirty braids! The lifeguard Xiao He handed us fresh big green coconuts to drink several times, free of charge, thank you 😊, drink some by the pool, it feels very good ~ and Wang Liubao, who is doing room service for us, is really working hard, every time He warmly greets the children, even if we take the initiative to say that we don't need to be careful about hygiene, he is still meticulous. Although the Sheraton has a long history and is the oldest five-star hotel in Yalong Bay, I can feel the enthusiasm of everyone, the unrestrained frangipani, the lobby and garden full of Southeast Asian a**osphere, and the free and undisciplined little squirrels... Come experience it next time

msg:I liked the hotel's gardens and spacious and bright rooms, so I renewed my reservation for two days and changed to a full sea view room. The view is really good. The room service responds quickly. Every time they see the young men in white overalls, they will take the initiative to say hello. When you are hesitant, they will immediately ask what you need. The beach service is also very proactive in handing over towels and saying hello. What can be improved is the front desk service, which can respond faster to the guests who change the room. After all, they leave time and money to the hotel because they like the hotel. This time, the room adjus**ent wants to see the room type. The front desk let us go and see. There was a room being cleaned and I told the front desk that we would be notified by phone. After waiting for an hour, there was no phone call. I ran up to see that the room was ready. I called the customer service number and said that the front desk would ask the concierge to deliver the keys to the room. After waiting for half an hour, I called customer service again. In addition, many hotels have given away small refrigerators in the guest rooms on the first day. If there is a charge, guests should be reminded. Overall, the flaws are not concealed, the price is high, and it is recommended.

Before coming here, I was a little worried about the old hotel, but the beach and lawn are great, the unique beach C, the garden is well maintained, the rooms are big enough, and the friendly service does not affect the experience in the hotel at all.
[Dining] There are a lot of meals in the store, or you can walk a few steps to the Dongrong Food Plaza next door, or take a 5-minute taxi ride to Baihuagu for dinner, all of which can meet the needs of cheap, special, and delicious meals.
[Event] The hotel gives 3 free island travel photos. It is very convenient to make an appoin**ent, the master is very nice, and the fee for additional photos is reasonable. During the store, there will be nucleic acid in the store every day. It's just that the hotel is a bit deserted at night, and there are no performances or activities, but it is understandable in the off-season now.
[Service] The service staff I came into contact with were very friendly. After checking in, because I wanted to change to a higher floor, the whole room change process was also very thoughtful; I gave a late check-out if the room status allowed; the lifeguard by the pool He will also teach you how to play the floating board; the uncle on the lawn barbecue is very enthusiastic (the grilled chicken is very delicious); the waiter at breakfast will remind you if you have done nucleic acid...

This hotel was recommended by my friend before he came. I booked a room one day in advance. The overall stay felt very good, especially the bathtub, which was very comfortable to lie down. It is a resort hotel that is very suitable for lying flat, and you can also bring children to stay

To sum up, next time I will choose their family to bring my parents on vacation

msg:A super perfect check-in experience, from check-in to check-out, there is a feeling of home away from home. As the first Sheraton Hotel in Sanya, first of all, the location of the hotel is super good. In the C position of Yalong Bay, there are Baihua Valley and Ultras next to it. Eating and shopping is very convenient. When I booked the hotel at the beginning, I was a little worried that the hotel's facilities and the rooms would be outdated. But to my surprise, the hotel is very well maintained. Sheraton's garden design is very good, the green coverage area is super large, it is super comfortable to walk in the garden after dinner, the swimming pool is also very large, and the children's playground is especially suitable for bringing children here. On vacation, the beach in Yalong Bay is super soft, and the photos are also very special. Besides, the restaurant, the breakfast is very rich, and the taste is very cost-effective in hotels with the same price. But understandable. The view of the hotel's room is superb. Although the facilities are not new, they are well maintained. The cleaning is very clean and the bedding is very comfortable. The hotel's service is worthy of praise. I would like to commend the beautiful on-duty manager of the hotel here. Delia Dong, who is super skilled in business, knew that we brought our family over for vacation and helped us arrange a room with a good orientation. He also reminded us where to do nucleic acid, and introduced us to the surrounding food and attractions worth punching in. It is the best service I have experienced in this hotel in Hainan. This Sheraton is really a treasure hotel and worth checking in again.

msg:It is reasonable to put the facts, because my friend stayed at MGM and the environment was good. We wanted a different experience in the hotel, so we chose the Sheraton next door to be close. In my opinion, it was a very failed experience trip. I just entered. The temperature of the bath water is very low. I thought it might be a little later. I didn’t care, but my companion came back from snorkeling to take a bath. The hair dryer socket is loose, I called the customer service staff, and repeatedly received feedback that the manager came to solve the problem, and the manager himself also said that their water pipe was recently repaired due to unstable water pressure, and took me downstairs. Room, the visual effect of our original room was very good, but the view of the room that the manager gave me was a forest. Later, he got us a room on the first floor. When the door opened, there was a bitter musty smell. I will send you off in minutes. I rejected this plan. After waiting for two hours, I went to the front desk and told me about this matter before I was transferred to a room of the same type upstairs. I am happy that there is finally hot water, and the manager made up for it. The plan is to send two breakfasts. We are no longer in the mood to break up, so we accept the plan, but we will not consider Sheraton anymore because of the shadow! State the facts and think for yourself!

Hehe, I get up every day and see the scenery outside the window. Brother Xiao Chen also knows Sanya very well and can always give me useful advice. After staying a few more times, I will become his fan 😂 The gentle and soft accent helps me who doesn’t love such a concierge little brother
The lady who eats breakfast every day will also feed me hahaha maybe I am too lonely alone😚
Thank you very much for the service of the Sheraton staff who can enjoy the service at the moment, I have become a Sheraton fan! Looking forward to next stay! Looking forward to seeing you next time!

msg:I love Sheraton!
It is really the best choice to come to Sanya after the National Day in October! It's just lukewarm and it's still off-season! Wherever you go, there are very few people, the service is more attentive, and there is no need to line up at the duty-free shop, which is very leisurely and comfortable. Originally, I wanted to live in Haitang Bay, but I was a little tired of seeing the reefs there, and I couldn’t go to the sea at all. Compared with Sanya Bay, Yalong Bay is indeed an updated hotel with few people and good scenery. After comparing the hotels with private beaches in Yalong Bay, we chose Sheraton, the most cost-effective old hotel, I met my fairy front desk Melo and told everyone that this woman is really good. Knowing our honeymoon + my birthday, Not only gave us a free upgrade to a panoramic sea view suite! Arranged the honeymoon room layout (here I also thank Chen Xiaolei for cleaning the house, and also gave me a lot of bottles of water), and gave me a birthday cake! Wow, I really didn't expect this at the time! What! arrive! bit! "Home away from home" is nothing more than that! I love her so much haha
Their bbq in the evening is also quite delicious. I need to book a little in advance. I really love the dish of salmon with cheese balls! Confess Chef~
In addition, the beach here is also very fun. The swimming ring is free for hotel guests. There are also many motor boats, little yellow ducks, and the one that flies to the sky when you step on it. There are many projects, you can come and try it. try.
The location is also very good. There is a small night market next door. It takes 5 minutes to drive to Lin Jie seafood, Ajun seafood and so on. There is a nucleic acid test point within 10 minutes of driving. (The hotel also has nucleic acid to do in the morning, it seems like one, three, five, you can ask the front desk for details)
When I left the store, Iris at the front desk was also a very caring young lady. The service was very efficient and she even gave me a small gift~
In short, this trip is really worth the money, thank you for meeting these lovely people on the trip~
Hope to see you again next time~

The next day, I didn't know what tour group was coming. It was so noisy that I kept arguing in the corridor in the middle of the night. I was really convinced. . .
The environment is still very beautiful. My favorite is the breakfast here. There are many styles. My favorite is passion fruit. I have to make a plate every day.
The hotel staff are friendly and good quality. The fly in the oin**ent is basically not open, and the swimming pool water is very cold. .
Staying here again with the good memories of my last visit, I really feel a little lonely. . .

Atlantis, Kaaba Intercontinental, MGM, and Tianyu are all full of experience. I hope Sheraton can continue to work hard.

With beauty, give 5 stars, hope for better!

The room is relatively large, the pillows are very comfortable, and there are a lot of mineral water sent every day 3. The swimming pool is very good Many, hidden in the greenery 4. The breakfast is richer and the dishes are more. The disadvantage is that the check-in time is relatively long, and there is no special person to guide the queue. I feel that the consultation in the lobby needs to be strengthened.

msg:Too bad, the room smelled very musty at the beginning, and the smoke was not good. I asked to change rooms. They said that no one came for half an hour. I called again and said to wait. Changed, it still smells a bit, the room is poorly decorated, the aging is serious, the wardrobe has no handle, the door opens and closes, and there are only two sockets in the whole room that are not at the bedside, and you have to sit next to the TV cabinet or stay in the room to charge at night. The entrance, the bathroom is very small, a few small bottles of toiletries are enough, the TV can't be connected to the Internet, the hotel design is strange, from outside the hotel to the lobby to do business, the lobby is on the second floor, and the courtyard is on the first floor. Go to the first floor. If you go to the lobby to do errands and then go to play, you need to take the stairs or go to the end of the corridor to change the elevator. The breakfast is Western-style, with not many styles and tastes. I thought that boiled eggs with clean eggs were too soft to drink. Yes, I asked the waiter and said that the cooking time was short and not cooked. The greening of the hotel is quite satisfactory, but like the building, it is divided into two parts. Living in one side will hardly go to the other side. There is a natural sense of isolation. The swimming pool needs a blanket. Registration, ordered two 2 nights, said that they could connect, and paid a 4 night deposit, but after two days the door card could not be opened, and they would not be cleaned. I wrote this comment while I was waiting, all the service responses were so slow that I didn’t want to do it for you, I just forced you to do it yourself. I have stayed in a hotel of similar price in Yalong Bay before, it’s much better than this, keep your eyes open Bar

msg:This is the second time. Last year's National Day also came. This year, I still chose Sheraton. This time, probably just after the epidemic was over, the hotel was a bit caught off guard. The hygiene in the room and the breakfast were almost all, but I understand. However, the Sheraton's external environment is very good. There are many large and small swimming pools, each of which is different, and the beautiful blue sea can be seen in the swimming pool. Playing in the swimming pool can consume most of the day! Very close to the beach, out of the room, go to the beach at any time! Next time I come, I will stay in Yalong Bay. The sea is much bluer than Haitang Bay, and the sand is a little thicker than last year. It is estimated that the hotel has not had time to take care of it. In addition, Sheraton's lawn is super extra, and the super delicate grass is also super good.

msg:The legendary Yalong Bay C position, but the overall feeling does not have a significant advantage. It may be that it reopened soon after the suspension of business due to the epidemic. Obviously, the hotel was not fully prepared for the National Day.
Although there were workers cleaning, the pool still had a lot of leaves floating or on the bottom and was closed at 7pm.
The quality of breakfast is far from the standard, and the varieties are mostly patchwork of low and medium quality. Fried eggs are fully cooked and hard; boiled eggs are mostly overcooked and bitter. Dried fruits, especially walnuts, are actually moldy! Hainan's fruit is cheap, and the breakfast room doesn't have any high-end fruits, just cantaloupe and watermelon. The breakfast room is not well ventilated and there is a lot of oil smoke.
In addition, on the day of check-in, there was a temporary power outage for a few minutes. After the call, the hot water pipe turned out to be terrifying yellow water. They called the workers and said that it was caused by the abnormality of the hot water pump caused by the power outage. In such a big hotel, the water pump did not have a UPS.
The beach is not cleaned up in time, and there is always a lot of sea****, ****s and garbage. The sun lounger cushions by the beach and pool were not picked up when it rained, were always wet, and had leaves and debris, many of which were useless all the time.
The hygiene is good, the room is cleaned in a timely manner, and the lawn and garden management effect is good. You can see that the employees are working hard.
The overall scenery is beautiful, after all, this is the most important thing to come to Sanya. There are some fly in the ointment, which may be the embodiment of Hainan's overall management quality. There is absolutely no need to build a free trade zone in Hainan. It is the right way to focus on resources to improve the overall level of tourism and leisure services.

msg:Because of these bugs, the beauty of Yalong Bay is hidden
When I designed my trip to Sanya, I locked three bays, Sanya Bay, Yalong Bay and Haitang Bay. Yalong Bay has been there many years ago. This time, I want to go swimming in the sea. In fact, Sanya Bay can also go to the sea. There are fewer people and it is more gentle, but Yalong Bay is a private beach. The hotel is directly on the shore, which is better than Sanya Bay. This public beach is a little more private.
Sheraton Yalong Bay has a long history. It has advantages and disadvantages for the hotel. The disadvantage is that the facilities are aging. For example, the toilet in our sea-view room has to be pressed for a long time before flushing, which is dumbfounding. Look at the sea from the swimming pool, and look at the sea from the coconut trees and phoenix trees.
As for service, there are pros and cons. I also know that Sanya has the loosest anti-epidemic policy in the country, and people from Beijing and Shanghai are rushing here, so it is reasonable that the housing situation is tight. When I checked in, I noted that I hoped for a high floor. The Yalong Bay Superior Sea View Room itself is on the 5th to 7th floor. The front desk said that it is still uncertain, and I will look at it later (I will check in at the hotel after 12 o'clock). However, the form filled out by the front desk has been marked as room 2524, which is the room on the 5th floor. If the front desk can't raise the floor, just say it directly, why pretend to comfort? ! This is my biggest dissatisfaction with this hotel, the bathroom problem is second. In short, the last view of the sea view room on the fifth floor is to look at the top of the tree, overlooking the sea, and the MGM next to it facing the sea. I hope to experience it next time.
The hotel called me many times after I left the hotel, and it was just because I had various things at the time that it was inconvenient to elaborate. Therefore, I will express my specific feelings here.

You can get water at any time in the lobby and by the swimming pool. It is a good hotel in Yalong Bay. The service is very friendly and can deal with problems in a timely manner. The room facilities are also very clean and comfortable, especially the whole mirror behind the bathroom door and the foldable drying rack on the balcony. The fly in the oin**ent is that the bed was a bit soft for me personally. It takes up to five minutes to walk to Dongrong Seafood and Food City, and it is very convenient to eat.

msg:I have come to Yalong Bay many times, the first time I stayed at Sheraton, it exceeded my expectations.

Hardware - large area, full facilities, although the hotel is old and some parts are a bit old, but well maintained. The lobby is grand and magnificent. It is very pleasant to come to the lobby bar for a drink at night and listen to the singing of the resident guests. The poolside room we stayed in was convenient for swimming. There are not many people in the swimming pool, especially at night, lying on the swimming ring, slowly paddling, and look at the stars in the sky.

The buffet breakfast is available on the first and second floors. It is recommended to go to the second floor. Although it is not as big as the first floor, the food is the same, and there are not many people, so the waiters can be busy. Another point is that because there is air conditioning in the room, it will not be hot and will not be exposed to the sun. The meals are plentiful, with small changes every day.

Finally, the service, the waiters are very enthusiastic, but they are very comfortable. When passing by, they will take the initiative to say hello, not deliberately, like the feeling of the host entertaining friends to play at home. The day before my son's birthday, I called him specially, and arranged a cake the next day. It was a surprise, thank you very much.

msg:advantage
The environment of the hotel and the design of the lobby, the seaside vacation has a great advantage and is also a selling point. Several people think that it is to buy an environment to live.
The waiter took the initiative to say hello, but not professional, professional means your smile, the product you want to sell, such as fried ice in the lobby, is not delicious, you can try it when it is hot

shortcoming
The room is really bad. The hotel room looking at the sea may have sea breeze, not stuffy. All garden rooms that don't look at the sea are really musty. Do not stay below the 7th floor. The fourth floor smells of musty, and it is useless to open the window when it is stuffy, because there is no wind, and the opposite is full of mountains. I think this is the disadvantage of all hotels in Yalong Bay. It is very suitable for golf because there is no wind😅.
I took my child from the 4th floor to adjust the 7th floor. The air conditioner in the room blows so that you can't sleep. When it is turned off, it is very hot. In Sanya at the end of July, you can know when you think about it. No, it's very uncomfortable. I haven't slept well for 2 nights, and I have to play with a 9-year-old during the day.
Secondly, many people say that the facilities are outdated. In my opinion, it does not mean the appearance is outdated. The appearance of the room is outdated, but these do not affect your sleep. But the point of obsolescence is to point out where it comes from. The first mattress is not good and cannot be a five-star "mattress". The second "air conditioner" is outdated and should be replaced. There is no air circulation. The small living room in the corridor from the guest room should be in a ventilated state. The ventilation is not good, so there is a musty smell.
This is not as good as hotels in Thailand or Bali, they are well ventilated.

The girl who made the reservation in the children's depar**ent could not understand the needs of the guests.
Although there was an appoin**ent, the communication was difficult.
I came back and called me and said that I will help you upgrade next time. Seriously, I will not go to live next time.
You can try the buffet, and remember to ask the front desk for the free drink coupon presented by Ctrip. Otherwise they will forget. I got it myself the next day. You can have a drink at the bar in the hotel lobby. After the self-service band sings on Thursday night, it will continue to sing here in the lobby.

The breakfast has many varieties and tastes, the room is warm, the bedding is very comfortable, the hotel garden is also very designed, and the service staff is enthusiastic.

If there is a problem with the room, I will immediately help to change the room. There is a small night market 200 meters next to it. It is very convenient to eat. There are still some regrets when I booked this hotel, I mainly wanted to lie on the deck chair facing the sea for a day, then order food and drink and enjoy it. I called specifically to confirm whether this service is available, but after I came it was around 2:30 pm I wanted to order on the phone and said that because I received a team of 100 people today, the food delivery service by the beach was closed in advance. The overall stay environment is still very comfortable.

msg:1. Every time you go to Yalong Bay, you must choose Sheraton. I love its award-winning Haitian Yise lobby design. It has not been here for a few years, and a glass viewing platform has been added.
2. The most important thing is that when you come to Sanya in summer, you can always find a shady swimming pool at Sheraton, especially the 1.05-meter parent-child swimming pool. You will be in the shade all afternoon, and you will have a worry-free swim all day.
3. The layout of luxury cruise ship design, with invincible sea view room.
4. The hotel and garden design with Southeast Asian characteristics adds to the comfort and coziness of the holiday.
5. As one of the earliest hotels in Yalong Bay, Sheraton has a superior beach location. The hotel is not old and maintains consistent high quality.
6. There are plenty of water entertainment items, the breakfast is very rich, and the restaurant dishes are sufficient. The self-service barbecue on the last picture is also recommended.

msg:For a trip that just went away, I decided to go to Sanya for the weekend temporarily. The hotel chose the old five-star Sheraton Yalong Bay Hotel. The main thing was the C position of the invincible beach in Yalong Bay. The hotel is indeed a bit old, and the room facilities are also very old-fashioned, but The maintenance is still good, there are no obvious flaws, the most important thing is the invincible sea view from the lobby, which is enough to make up for the lack of it in the room. The beach is delicate, the coastline is long, and there are not many people. I walk on the beach every night, listen to the sound of the waves, and enjoy the beauty of the rising moon on the sea, which is very healing. The little generation at the front desk was very friendly. When I checked out, they gave me a shell necklace and an island-style backpack, which ended my pleasant trip to the island. Sanya, bye 👋

msg:First of all, let’s talk about the shortcomings. I came to Sheraton Yalong Bay in December last year. This time I came to Sheraton Yalong Bay again. Compared with Sheraton in December last year, the price is not bad. It fluctuates between 600-800. The setback that I felt this time was 1. There were fewer types of breakfast. At the end of December last year, the breakfast at Sheraton Yalong Bay made me feel that the price was very high. Even after I went to the Westin in Shimei Bay, I felt that it was not as good as Sheraton Yalong Bay, but this time The breakfast was reduced by about 1/3, which was lower than expected value, and there was no lead in the breakfast process, and the ice latte was lost. 2. The doorman at the door is playing with his mobile phone at night. Although it is harmless, there are guests who have not used professional terminology. In this case, there will be a less professional feeling. 3. The water in the swimming pool is relatively dirty. I am not sure if the hotel’s revenue and expenditure is unbalanced due to the epidemic, and I also do not know how much the swimming pool water costs. Just speaking of the experience, the turbid swimming pool is indeed disappointing compared to last year.

About the advantages: Sheraton Yalong Bay is located in the C position of Yalong Bay, and it can go to the sea, which is temporarily impossible for many hotels. Secondly, the garden design of the hotel is very beautiful, and it has a feeling of a botanical garden. Compared with the price, Sheraton Yalong Bay is still worth the money. The room has also been refurbished to a certain extent, but the design is a little old-fashioned, and the musty smell is difficult to deal with. But if you stayed in the sea view suite last year, the large bathtub on the balcony really had a different experience. The Yalong Bay Sheraton's price is still worthy of his price. If you don't care about the design of the room, but you are very fond of playing by the sea, then this is definitely a good choice.

Several hotels near the sea in Yalong Bay are good. Sheraton is also good. You can see the sea from the location of breakfast. If you are too troublesome for lunch and dinner, you can eat buffet at the hotel. In the nearby Dongrong Market, choose more affordable prices for a change of taste. Haitang Bay Duty Free Shop has a free shuttle bus to the hotel every day. It is the Yalong Bay line. It is very convenient to make an appoin**ent with the hotel reservation depar**ent one day in advance. You can also make an appoin**ent for a day trip. In terms of service, basically every meeting will greet you.

Serious suspicion of false propaganda and illegal fundraising? Fraud? Let us be disappointed with Sanya Hotels and Ctrip. Ctrip is not a monopoly on the surface, but in fact it makes people think it is a monopoly? Can you book hotels and air tickets elsewhere? The key is that the price of Ctrip will increase after a few more inquiries 📈, which makes people speechless 😓, fortunately, the service from the front desk and the concierge of the hotel is good, otherwise I really don’t want to go again!

msg:Let’s talk about the conclusion first, the praise is full, and the off-season is really fragrant! Great value for money! Who can believe that there are less than 600 Sanya consumption coupon suites, and you can upgrade to the seaside pool villa for free when you arrive at the store, and the experience is perfect! See the picture for the room photo. It is similar to the sack sand house I lived in before. The small courtyard door is the beach and the seaside. I can&#39;t figure out one thing. There are no mosquitoes in the room at all. There are a lot of mosquitoes in the courtyard! The location is excellent, Yalong Bay is as beautiful as ever, Sheraton Yalong Bay Beach is C, and the blue and green sea water is the best in Sanya! Except for the swimming pool in the pool house, which is under maintenance, all the other swimming pools are open; there are indoor children&#39;s playgrounds, children&#39;s swimming pools (children&#39;s swimming pools have slides and water villages), and the main swimming pool has free swimming rings and paddle boards! Linhai provides many check-in points to meet the needs of friends who like to take pictures; Yalong Bay has been here many times and will come again next time, and a few people next door have lived there. The experience of Sheraton this time exceeded expectations by a lot, and it is the first time I have written so many reviews. For a hotel, I should come again next time, so I would like to make a small suggestion. The official WeChat account can be enriched, including but not limited to inquiring about hotel activities, maps, etc. Last year, the Sheraton Mannings seemed to have it, which is very convenient. Breakfast is available from 7:00 to 10:30. It can be long and has a wide variety of freshly squeezed juices. There are also many fruits and Chinese and Western desserts. There are also many types of noodle stalls and brines. Bringing children with small toys is a great experience! ! ! The service points are full, and the Marriott Gold also upgraded the room type for free when they arrived at the store. The staff were friendly and enthusiastic. I also experienced the BBQ by the sea. Although there are few types of meals, the price is very cheap and the environment is very good! There is a resident singing! There is also a food court next door, and it is a 3-minute walk to eat out. There is nothing to say, you must live. Oh, duty-free shop discounts and shuttle buses are also available, just make an appoin**ent at the concierge one day in advance. Going to MO in a few days, hope to be so lucky too....

The fat girl at the front desk didn't say sorry, so she planned to continue making cards and send me away. I just asked that I have already walked so far back and forth twice, and you just deal with it like this? She continued to respond quickly and claimed to upgrade. Excuse me, if rooms 43 to 47 are moved inward, one floor higher is an upgrade? Don't be too perfunctory with this service attitude!

msg:Thanks to the Sheraton Hotel for giving my daughter a very good experience. My daughter is a few months away from eighteen years old. I was a little worried about traveling alone. The hotel allows the children to check in by themselves after contacting the parents. Ms. Zhang Wenjuan at the front desk of the hotel changed the child to a double bed room and extended the check-out time to a little bit. The child felt very warm and I was very touched. The child said that because he departed from Beijing, he was afraid of being infected on the road and affecting other people, so he put a thermometer next to his bed to measure it every day. The waiter who cleaned the room specially left a message for her after seeing it, expressing that if the hotel can provide help, the child will feel very warm. Next time we go to Sanya, we will choose Sheraton~

When I arrived, there was someone at the door, but I thought it was a wooden man. Looking at my parked car, it didn't move. I waited for my car to stop and enter the lobby. When I was asked to stop again, it stopped crooked. The little brother who took the temperature at the door was also leisurely and was playing with his mobile phone all the time. When I went out and took things in the car, I couldn’t see me. When I came in, my dear, I was shocked by what you did, not to mention even the express hotel. All have to say hello like a guest, this place is like a security guard in the yamen. Don't mention it after checking in, there is basically no service, I feel indifferent everywhere, no one greets you when you enter the door, no one takes your luggage, and you don't say a word when you go out. The hotel facilities are old, the only good thing is that the tree is relatively large, the garden view is OK, and the seaside beach is good. It just lacks the human touch! The old five-star brand looks really old. You can't spend cheap money, why don't you live in the new five-star next to it!

The first room had a strong musty smell and was very humid. After contacting the front desk to change rooms, it took a long time. The second room smelled of smoke. Because it was already three or four o'clock in the afternoon, I didn't want to toss any more, so I opened the window to ventilate while I went out to eat. During this period, the waiter brought a ventilator after we reported it. This is okay. After going back later, I found that the air conditioner in the room was not cool, so I found a master to fix it, and after a while, I changed a room. It was about 7:30 in the evening at this time. However, the hotel staff also apologized in time, which is a little comfort. Bar.
Because of the climate problem in Yalong Bay and the decoration materials of Sheraton, the smell of the room is indeed relatively strong. Personally, if the budget is similar, the MGM Hilton next door is better.

Can't you open the window to let the smell out when there are no guests? Besides the service, it takes half an hour for the front desk to deliver the food. The delivery of ice cubes is also very slow. There is no butler and WeChat for full service. It is true that you have to write a good review and write the name of so and so when you check out. Have you served? It is recommended to learn from Marriott. The butler provides full service from check-in to check-out. This is the qualification for praise.

I did not expect the hotel to arrange nucleic acid testing in the hotel infirmary from 9:00 to 11:00 every morning, saving us the trouble of running around, which is more considerate , The hotel's private beach was originally my original intention to book this store, and the result did not disappoint me. It is also very convenient to watch the sunrise at the hotel. Now this season, you can watch the sunrise at 7:00 in the morning, and you don't have to be very tired. I also stayed in a hotel in Haitang Bay before, and I can only say that each has its own characteristics. It is an Internet celebrity hotel with a stronger sense of design and newer facilities. There are many people and it is a bit noisy. Although the facilities here are a bit older, it is quieter and slower to live.

Lessons from the history of blood and tears Trouble again. I believe that all parents with children know that a severe cough will turn into bronchitis and then pneumonia. In such a hygienic situation, staying at the Sheraton is really the beginning of a nigh**are.

🍃 Environment:
Let’s start with the overall decoration. The decoration 10 or 20 years ago can be said to be outdated. The windows are all old-fashioned aluminum alloy single-layer glass. Now even the mountains and rural areas don’t need this configuration. The door locks are all broken, the lights are dim, not at all.

🍛 Breakfast
There are not many people to say, there are not many kinds of breakfast, and the taste can be said to be awake scalp to eat.

msg:I feel that the hotel is located at the core of Yalong Bay Beach. It is commendable that the hotel has a clear and beautiful garden landscape. There is a large green grass between the building and the beach, coconut trees swaying on both sides. The landscape is the best. The hotel has independent use of the beach, beach chairs are comfortable and well managed. The lobby and public areas of the hotel are luxurious. The rooms are large, especially the beds. However, the decoration style of the rooms is a bit outdated. Unfortunately, there is no underground parking lot. Rich breakfast. The railing of the balcony blocks the sight (sitting), it is recommended to increase the height, and the room lighting is dim.

However, the facilities in the room are a bit outdated and not suitable for the hotel. The TV light in the room was broken on the first night and could not be turned off. In the big night, I could only find someone to turn on the light. The customer service did not say to change the room. , fortunately for the room on the high floor, the view is better!

This time, thanks to the lovely Alice at the front desk, taking into account our special circumstances, the upgrade has doubled the wonderful experience. In addition, I would also like to thank Lugger Aron and other front desks Xiao Shen, Xiao Dai, and Xiao Wang. Because of your efforts, Sheraton is getting better and better!

A little tip: Sheraton would be even better if it had butler service and an executive lounge!

Yalong Bay Hotel has lived almost from house to house. This time it is Sheraton’s turn. The hotel has a good location. A small food plaza has been opened at the entrance of the Marriott on the left. After walking for 5 minutes, there are coconut chicken, Korean barbecue and tea restaurants, which are closer than Baihua Valley. The hotel has a good breakfast. The hotel has several infinity swimming pools, which children like very much. There are many children in a small pool with constant temperature, and the pool is slightly smaller. Stayed for five days, overall satisfied. You can also experience hotel travel photography, send 5 free photos, choose 30 yuan for one more, the memory card can be directly connected to the mobile phone, and it will be completed in seconds.

As soon as I entered the hotel, I had the taste of Southeast Asia, and I immediately regained the feeling of being on vacation. Later, I also checked the surrounding hotels on the spot, and there was no Sheraton style. The hotel room is very big and clean. Although it is an old hotel, it still feels very new! The view is very good, the invincible first-line sea view, the beach and the sea are very beautiful! It feels very comfortable to stay on the balcony without going downstairs! Everyone at the hotel is very nice! Special thanks to the beautiful Miss Tian Xue at the front desk, Anthony, and Zhou Zhangpei and Chen Chen from the concierge depar**ent. Next time I come to Yalong Bay, I will continue to choose Sheraton, it's really great!

Advantages: Sitting on the first-line beach of Yalong Bay, the sea view is invincible, suitable for friends who love to watch the sea and play in the water, and the hotel facilities are generally OK.
Disadvantages: After all, it opened very early, the room facilities and the hotel are relatively old, but they are all clean, that is, there will be no nightlife at night.
In conclusion, it is quite acceptable. The discounted price on weekdays is more fragrant. There is nothing to say about Sheraton service. It is a good experience! I think it is very good to take the elderly and children to play on vacation. I would also like to thank the reception staff for their enthusiasm, and thank Jason, Xiaoshen, and Xiaotian for their services! Homemade popsicles in the lobby are super delicious~

I forgot how many years ago I came to this hotel
Hardware has become obsolete
But the environment is still very comfortable and characteristic
And the software is too much to my liking,
​Every waiter is so sincere and literate, not in a hurry, and can help solve problems, making people feel very at ease

​From surfboard experience, to negotiating prices for marine projects, to borrowing skateboards, to the whole journey of the small train, to the enthusiastic inquiries to tell when and where to catch the sea, where to buy fruit, and how to identify delicious passion fruit

Whether you mention your needs or not, you can always think about the guests, and it is very natural and simple.

The lifeguard took great care of us and offered to let us go to the beach the next morning and pick fresh coconuts on the tree. The coconut seller on the beach said that it was good to stay in the hotel and deliver coconuts. I said no, because the people were nice . These unexpected benefits add warmth and fun to the journey

How can a certain domain compare with this hotel, although children like it. If it is purely for the sake of children, or if you like to be lively, say something else.

Arrived at two o'clock in the afternoon, check-in was fast, Anthony and Li Pixin at the front desk were very attentive, and the check-in guidelines were in place.
Check the weather forecast. The weather in Sanya is 27.8 degrees. Actually it feels more than 30 degrees ヾ^_^♪. You can bring a few more skirts and bikinis. Unfortunately, I only brought one (ง • ̀_• ́)ง. You can change it when you stay. Skirts go to the beach on the seashore, and you can go swimming in a heated swimming pool.
Baihuagu Commercial Street is not far from the hotel, you can walk to drink milk tea for dinner and shop at the clothing store. That night I bought two skirts and a set of bikinis (♡˙︶˙♡).
After staying for four days, I ate breakfast at 9 o'clock in the morning and took a break before going swimming. I took a break at noon, went to the scenic spots at 2:30 in the afternoon, and went back to Baihua Valley for dinner in the evening without being tired.
Nanhai Guanyin and Tianya Haijiao are far away from the hotel, so it's not bad to arrange a day to play.
Yalong Bay Tropical Forest Paradise Park is 5.3 kilometers away from the hotel. Just go for a play in the afternoon. The Bird’s Nest Resort and the Long Cable Bridge in the park, where you are the one, are worth checking in.
The overall environment and services of the hotel are good. The breakfast is rich in variety and the room service is very considerate.

msg:As the earliest tourist attraction in Sanya, Yalong Bay still has beautiful scenery. The beaches along the bay are basically internationally renowned five-star hotels. Sheraton is at the C position in Yalong Bay. Once you enter the door, it feels like the decoration style of Southeast Asia, and thinks of Shangri-La in Sabah. It feels similar to other friends, the room design is good, the facilities are slightly outdated, the hotel is strong in supporting facilities, large areas of greenery, grasslands, and swimming pools everywhere. There are also long coastlines, soft sandy beaches, beach barbecues and music parties at night. At this time, there are indeed a lot less people. The good thing is that it is quiet, but the bad thing is that some entertainment services will be suspended. After checking out, I went to the Atlantis Aquarium and immediately saw the difference. The hotel design in Haitang Bay was updated. There are many families with children, which is a bit noisy. Choosing a hotel depends on the needs of the people. This time I took my parents out for a trip around the island. Sheraton is very suitable.

The morning sun, the boundless sea, and the fine sandy beaches make people feel refreshed and happy. Due to the epidemic, there are not many tourists staying in the hotel, but the hotel service staff are warm and hospitable, and all the service staff who meet will take the initiative to greet us. In particular, the cleaning attendant (Wang Shaoling) saw that we drank a lot of water and was afraid that the water left in the room was not enough to drink. He deliberately put a few more bottles of water when cleaning the room and left a warm note, which was very touched. When walking on the beach, the lifeguard will also take the initiative to ask if you need help. A young lifeguard (Wang Fengli) chatted with us a lot and introduced the changes in Sanya over the years and the surrounding commercial facilities and food. We also invited us to drink. Coconut, I am very happy. The daily breakfast is very rich, which suits our appetite. The waiter helps to lead the seat and pour coffee. On the day before I left, I also gave a cookie (seeing the name badge is the waiter named Xia Keyong), I was very touched.
In short, this time we came to Sanya for vacation and stayed at Sheraton, it was very enjoyable. If possible, come back next year.

When cleaning, Aunt Wang and Cao also wrote a small note, folded the clothes and tidy up the cosmetics.
Mainly the beach! It's so cozy! You can lie down all afternoon! I went to pick up shells in the morning!
After playing for two days, I got a lot of tans, but when I checked out, Miss Kiko at the front desk actually gave a souvenir-rose soothing mask! It's really a surprise~

msg:I came to Sanya for vacation in November for the first time, and I chose a hotel for a long time, because the reputation of five-star hotels is generally similar. I chose Sheraton, one is because it is said that it has a sea view, but because the garden design is very in line with my aesthetics, so I ignored the problem that the decoration is said to be a bit old. Stayed for 4 days and visited several five-star hotels next door, I must say this is the best choice. Is the sea view important? Especially important, because unless you go to the sea then where you lie and watch the sea is very important, the view of the sea from the two next door is not so beautiful! The design style of the hotel is very attractive. The open and natural landscape, the elegant and a**ospheric corridors and the aesthetics of the lobby make me think that this is an aesthetic design rather than an embellishment of decoration... Yes, I am pulling some hotels. A very important point is that the good service here is good because the sense of service is very strong and caring, which is very important for people on vacation. I personally like the decoration of the room, but the only drawback is that the bathtub is not big enough. The room cleaning staff will leave me a note every day, the front desk staff Yuki and her colleague Jason are also very caring, and the breakfast restaurant staff are very sweet! To be honest, I was looking forward to another luxury hotel in the Mid-Levels, and I went there later, but I found that the Sheraton was even better. I sincerely hope that Sheraton will continue to uphold its consistently high service standards and I won’t be disappointed next time I go. Oh, the btw track swimming pool is great, the water is deep enough.

msg:I moved from Haitang Bay to Yalong Bay to try a hotel. I didn't expect to encounter such a "five-star" hotel, which made me think it was the mouse **** of Yalong Bay. I really regret not reading the bad reviews, and almost stepped on 80% of the pits. At first I thought about how the Sheraton brand has quality control, but I didn't expect that I would avoid these three words in the future! Absolute nightmare
Facilities: very very very old! Old can understand, old + no maintenance is very disgusting, spent more than 800 is not as good as Wyndham's three or four hundred... Once in the door is like traveling back to the 80s and 90s, the entire Southeast Asian refugee style... Like the sound of a helicopter hovering outside, imagine for yourself...
The swimming pool is very small, and there are no entertainment facilities. The beach has to take off your shoes, but the sand near the stairs is very rough, there are gravel and garbage... It can be seen that it is a public beach, and there is no maintenance... Personally think the beach is really inferior The cleanliness of Haitang Bay...
Besides service, there is no service, the front desk is indifferent, the doorman is very good (will take the initiative to greet with the luggage), and it is not of the same level as Haitang Bay... Don't choose this place on vacation, it's crazy!
In the event of a typhoon, I can’t check out in advance (I’m willing to pay a 20% penalty). The hotel is very resolute. Then I step back and change the date. It is also higher than my reservation, theoretically completely possible), properly write the shop bullying on the face! ! !
I can only say that I am very fortunate not to live in this broken thing during a typhoon. I have to make myself mad, and I will be blacked out when I see the word Sheraton in the future, that is, under the bottom line of the entire Sanya hotel, only the village hotel can be "comparable."

The sea water quality of the beach at the door is much better than expected. I have been to MGM and Marriott next door for running in the evening. Fortunately, I chose the Sheraton, which is very suitable. For a three-year-old child, the MGM shows are lively but noisy. Marriott's swimming pool is quite deep. It’s not cheap to eat the whole meal at the hotel. It can only be said that it saves the trouble of going out in traffic jams and queuing, and you can also order takeaway. Overall quite satisfied.

msg:I like this Sheraton Hotel very much. Since I first stayed here in 2013, I have been unforgettable. I have stayed in this hotel for 8 years. I personally think it is the most cost-effective hotel in Yalong Bay: 1. Larger room, twin room It is placed with a 1.37 double bed and a large sofa. It is not too crowded for 5 people. It is great for a family like me who takes a daughter-in-law, mother and 2 children on a family trip and wants to save on accommodation costs. choose. 2. The design of the swimming pool is reasonable. Most of the swimming pools are covered by garden vegetation, so you don't have to worry too much about getting sunburned when you swim in the direct sun. 3. The hotel is very close to the beach. If you encounter a thunderstorm while playing on the beach, you can run back to the hotel within half a minute. 4. Because the hotel was built early, it sits on the best C-position beach in Yalong Bay, with beautiful scenery and excellent photo effects. 5. The hotel has complete parent-child facilities, a children’s playground, a water park, and a claw machine. Children come and don’t want to go. These advantages have made me stay in this hotel in Sanya for 8 consecutive years and reluctant to leave. Of course, because it is an old hotel that has been operating for many years, the facilities will inevitably be outdated, but the price has also come down. The lowest price is 550 yuan a night. Compared with the nearby Ritz, the price of St. Regis is 2.3 thousand. It is a great experience. You can't have both. Personally admire this hotel very much. Suggestion: The taste of the hotel’s dining is now lower than before. The dishes cooked at Baiyun Chinese Restaurant and Yaochi Western Restaurant are not as good as before. I don’t know if it’s the chef’s problem. I ordered takeout or went to the restaurant this time. Next to Hilton and Marriott went to dinner, I hope it can be improved.

There are four swimming pools (including bubble pool and track pool).

The first day was a field trip to several hotels by the beach. In order, Tianyu and Mangroves , MGM, Sheraton, Marriott, Hilton, Ritz-Carlton, through cost-effectiveness, the overall hotel, green plants, beaches, whether it can be upgraded, etc., I finally chose Sheraton. I stayed four nights in a row. I was very satisfied. It is large, the beach is wide and gentle, the lounge chairs are lined up with a good view, and the breakfast and dinner buffets are also very rich. Since it is the off-season, we have been upgraded to the room, very satisfied!

After arriving at the store, the guy at the front desk said that this room type is not available. I said, then I would book a try from Ctrip. He said that if there is no such room type, I need to change to the basic room type. I said that you can upgrade it, but you can’t downgrade it. Finally, I upgraded a room type and asked me to wait for 20 minutes. Said to make a list, and finally waited 22 minutes and then said it was not good, the attitude was very unfriendly. It feels like to wait deliberately. I saw that there was a 5% discount for duty-free shops on Ctrip. I was going to the duty-free shop the next morning. I asked the concierge. The concierge said impatiently that he had to scan the code one day in advance, and no one said that he had to scan the code one day in advance. Hotel service The attitude of the staff is really unacceptable! Does not match the brand level of this hotel!

I immediately expressed my understanding and helped us find a vacancy. We stayed in three rooms. Only one air conditioner was good. The facilities were a little bit old, but it did not hinder the quality of the tour.

The hotel is very beautifully planned. There is a large area of clean lawn downstairs and the seaside is further ahead.

The swimming pool planning is very good. There are children who specialize in swimming with lanes and play with older adults and children.

Much better than the MGM next to it! ! mgm eats with the pool so dirty

I will definitely bring the whole family to stay for another two weeks

msg:First of all, thank you very much for the lobby manager who checked in at noon on 7.4 for helping my two children arrange and solve the breakfast problem. Speaking of breakfast, it is really hearty. All kinds of Chinese and Western breakfasts are delicious. I took a lot of food photos before leaving the store. . . Next is the matching lagoon swimming pool, which is the favorite of children. The water depth of 105cm is just right. The underwater photos are very beautiful. You can walk to the beach in 3 minutes. The beach of Yalong Bay is very comfortable to step on (and West Island Bihaha). ), we took a group of beautiful sunrise photos. The fruit shop next to the pool is also great, the Aomang is super delicious! In addition, there is Dongrong Food Plaza next to the hotel. After staying for seven days, I ate every restaurant hahaha. The room is very clean. I live in a deluxe sea-view room. What you need most for swimming and playing in the sand is a large bathroom. Also, the strawberry mango cream cake delivered by the hotel on my birthday was delicious and thoughtful. I will definitely use this place again when I come back to Sanya (not far from Atlantis and West Island), and I recommend it to everyone. ~

msg:We stayed at this hotel during the summer holidays. From the first days we did not have a relationship with this hotel. The first day there was not enough food on the buffet , there was nothing to eat , and the ticket costs 638 Yuan for two people . And even the cola ran out on the buffet 😂💪 in general ... On the second day, they forgot to clean the room and when we returned home it was dirty and there were no clean towels. We had to go to the reception again to figure out why during the day we were not cleaned. On the third day, the waiter accidentally hit the child in the eye with a plate. Even in the room after cleaning it was very dirty and the cobweb was right over our heads and we had to clean it ourselves. Honestly, the hotel is not worth the money we paid. At the bar in the pool, too, they must have been waiting for their coconuts. The hotel does not correspond to 5 stars. we definitely won't be back. Next time we will choose another hotel. The pools were normal, clean, but the water was very hot as it heated up quickly.

msg:The beach is very good, the sea view is beautiful, the pool sanitation is not good, the rooms are spacious and clean, the breakfast is good, the handsome guy at the front desk has a very good attitude and is very user-friendly. However, some service staff are not quite innocent, as if they have grudges with the guests, with a stinky face, for fear of the guests taking advantage. The billing method of the water amu*****t project in the swimming pool is very wrong, and it cannot be compared with the Sheraton in Haitang Bay. The hotel should take good care of them.

msg:I went to Sanya 9 years ago and chose to stay at Sheraton for three nights. The green garden swimming pool is still so good. The beach is also good as always. The room facilities are completely ok. The cleaning aunt on the first day saw that we drank three bottles of water and immediately replenished 6 bottles for us. After that, we found that the amount of water we drank was amazing. Simply put 10 bottles of water was not worth the money. It's hard work! The resort a**osphere of the entire hotel is 1/3 of the price of an Internet celebrity hotel in Haitang Bay in the second half of the trip and 3 times the happiness! I want to commend the hotel’s children’s recreation center, although it is not big and the facilities are not new, but the staff in it are really nice and kind to the children! To say a step backward: 1 is the breakfast. The type and taste are not as good as before. 2 is the enthusiasm of the hotel staff. Overall, it is a good choice for family vacations.

msg:Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha~ I cannot go abroad, I can only be forced to come to Sanya to be happy. I stayed in Sheraton for three nights, and I hesitated after I checked in. , Recommendation from the heart, talk about the advantages and disadvantages.
Advantages: 1. The greening is excellent, it is really only the old greening (the tree industry also takes time hahahaha), all are coconut trees and lawns, lawns and beaches are seamlessly connected, this point is 100 points, I originally thought of Marriott Later, I found out that the Marriott next door didn't have so many lawns, and I instantly felt it was worth it.
2. One children's pool and two adult pools are by the sea, with constant temperature, it will not feel cold even after dark, the cleanliness needs to be improved, but it is also very, very comfortable.
3. The beach is very clean. The beach chairs are a bit crowded except when everyone comes out at 5 or 6 in the evening. The rest of the time is very sufficient. The sea is really beautiful and there are fewer people than public beaches.
4. Bedding and services are not perfect, they are online, especially when the manager of the Chinese restaurant saw me choking on medicine when I was uncomfortable, he poured water for me and packed breakfast, which was very touched.
5. There is a buffet dinner on the seaside lawn every day. Does it matter what you eat hahaha? What’s important is who you eat, where, drink, eat, barbecue, watch the sunset and sing, and on the premise that I only booked at 4 o’clock that day, Maybe as a guest in the hotel, he gave me a location close to the sea, so happy
Anyway is suitable for immersive relaxation. Here there is no work, no worries, only the sea and coconut trees, the beach and wine.
Of course, the shortcomings still have to be talked about hahaha.
1. The decoration of the internal corridor is too dark, just enter the room. The bathroom does have some mildew that has penetrated into the porcelain makeup in the shower room. This is probably not wiped off, and I don't mind it very much.
2. Breakfast tastes so-so hahahahahaha, I can’t say it’s unpalatable. If it’s delicious, it hurts my conscience.

msg:After reading the previous reviews, I thought it would be a bad experience. But as soon as I arrived at the hotel, the service staff were very enthusiastic and took the initiative to upgrade the sea view room with a balcony. There are also many swimming pools, and the children have fun. Directly connected to Yalong Bay Beach. scenery is beautiful. The only downside is that the hotel rooms are relatively old. So the price is cheaper than this generation. Overall still very satisfied!

msg:Came to Sanya for more than a week and stayed in four hotels. The most comfortable and comfortable place is the Sheraton. When we checked in, we took the baby and upgraded the room for free. Thanks for the warm service of the young lady and the little brother at the front desk. Check-in and check-out, the little brother of the hotel concierge helped with the luggage, Xiao Zhang and Xiao Wu from the concierge who worked hard~ After staying for two days, the breakfast was very rich and the service staff were very enthusiastic, and they would say hello when they met. The children's pool is also very big, and the baby loves it. The only downside is that there are too many shells and stones on the beach, and I stepped on my feet a little. Everything else is satisfied. Sanya will consider Sheraton in the future. Sheraton Yalong Bay and Haitang Bay are very good 👍

Although Haitang Bay is updated now, but the sea in Yalong Bay is still the best, the price is very high, and the health services are excellent! Sheraton is still very secure, especially Allen at the front desk and Xiao Wu at the concierge have good services. Intermediate room service is also to provide all kinds of things that can be provided, and a lot of mineral water is also given. The hotel’s swimming pool is beautiful and fun, there are not many people, I like it very much.

msg:Bringing the elderly and children Yalong Bay is still the first choice. After all, for children, the freedom to dig sand is the soul.
There are many hotels in Yalong Bay that I have chosen to choose for a few days or I chose Sheraton. After all, we have to consider that in addition to children, the elderly need to take care of the Sheraton. It can be said that the facilities for children are just right. The facilities are enough for the elderly to take a leisurely walk. There is also an objective environment. There is nothing wrong with Sheraton. The only thing is that it’s a bit old and the service is very good, especially the children by the pool. These days, they have been playing in the pool every day.

The light control switch is one meter away from the bed on both sides, and the person who turns on and off the light gets up from the bed and walks over to operate it? The light is also broken, suddenly flickering like a will-o'-the-wisp! The sink in the bathroom does not drain, it is not safe to wash your face😋😚

Because of the rush, I booked the wrong room type, but then I called the customer service and changed the room type to me patiently and enthusiastically. After arriving at the store, the service staff in the lobby were very attentive, and the children were super happy. Seeing the large swimming pool behind the hotel lobby, the children couldn’t wait to go swimming, but when it was dark, they only took the children to the beach. The sea breeze blows. Woke up early the next day, took the children to the swimming pool after breakfast for more than two hours, and there were professional lifeguards nearby. ...... Two days in the hotel, watching the sea, swimming, children playing beautifully, adults are also very happy! Highly recommend this hotel, love it!

I changed the room the next day, the plug at the bedside of the room was broken, and the switch key on the TV remote control board was also broken. I asked someone to look at it but didn’t change it for me. The mud under the roof, the windows of the room are also rusted, and the things in the hotel buffet are basically cold. But the external environment of the hotel is okay, and it is very convenient to buy things and eat around. Generally speaking, it is almost the same as an ordinary three-star hotel!

Found body hair on the mat and asked the hotel to clean it, only to have to wait an hour for it to come. Toss for an hour to finish changing. It was late to check in, and I waited for another two hours. The store didn't apologize at all, and didn't make a phone call. Sorry for the brand and price, I am so disappointed with Sheraton this time

1. The hotel is full of shopping places;
2. The breakfast is really not flattering;
3. There is a charge for the minibar. This is the first time I have experienced it in a five-star hotel. There is a charge for the minibar, and a box of small potato chips is 18. There is no obvious reminder of the charge;
4. After check-in, there is no housekeeper to take care of you. Call the customer service center, and the attitude is very cold;
5. The sofa chairs in the five-star hotel turned out to be broken and had not been replaced;

After staying for one day, I quickly changed to another hotel. I hope everyone chooses carefully.
I feel that this hotel is generally suitable for meetings and conferences, not for people who travel

The service is full of black faces, and there is no task waiter to help you with your luggage. Then the sanitation is definitely dirty enough, and the minimum room cleaning can't be done. Hey, the toiletries are not as good as the Samsung Express Hotel. Needless to say, the facilities are definitely the oldest and oldest in Yalong Bay. The hotel doesn't have anything suitable for children. 🥵🥵🥵The price can be high. I couldn't bear it anymore. I originally booked for 4 nights, but I really didn't want to stay for 1 night. The most frightening thing was that when the waiter came to deliver the fruit, he rang the bell, and when he went to open the door, he broke in by himself. I asked him why he came in by himself, and he said that he rang the bell, but no one answered, so he swiped his card to come in. I would like to ask, if there is no answer in 3 seconds, can the waiter just enter the guest room at will? Is there such a logic?

The only downside is that the clothes on the first floor can't be dried. Xiao Zhang and Xiao Xin from the concierge have a very good service attitude, and it is very convenient to send couriers.

The swimming pool in the second hotel is full of barbecue smell at night.
Three rooms are not well sealed and there are too many mosquitoes.

msg:首先我不是完美主義者，但是這次喜來登的住宿體驗，真是讓我炸毛。希望之後來亞龍灣的人可以避雷吧，硬件和軟件都真的跟不上。
1.服務人員嚴重不足，我是6月上旬入住的，酒店其實人還不算滿負荷，但是工作人員根本來不及，checkin等了20多分鐘，我一個人拖着個七歲的孩子，過程中無人問津，checkin之後箱子需要我自己拖到房間，我表示希望可以禮賓部協助，勉強答應了，送個行李送了45分鐘，同行的帶娃的媽媽一個人拖着行李走了很遠的並且老式的地毯很難推動。
2.房間感受非常差，好比招待所，當天風雨聲漏風嚴重影響休息，這裏感謝攜程，全程幫我跟酒店溝通，酒店處理的進度非常慢，換房直到將近晚上六點才結束，我和閨蜜拖着兩個孩子都很疲憊，期間前廳張經理還是協調我們去了相對比較好的套房並且送了第二天的下午茶表示歉意，對於她的服務還是滿意的。
3.自助早餐環節，我真的對喜來登的品控再次質疑了。麪包盤上的麪包擠壓着四五衹蒼蠅，當我跟服務員説了以後，全程無任何歉意，飛速的把麪包全部拿走當沒這回事了，讓我瞬間不想在用餐。飲料區的飲料一滴都沒了也沒服務員關注到去加。
4.最後是我住了那麼多年酒店，從來沒有打前台無人接聽，響鈴半分鐘，直接掛斷了。
真心希望喜來登可以提升自己的品質，加強服務管理，在你們家我真的感受不到半點服務，即使是老酒店硬件不足軟件也可以來補，之前的在三亞灣的鉑爾曼簡直是天堂級的服務，不要把喜來登幾十年的品牌砸在了亞龍灣。

👩💼服務：説到服務，真的是超五星！每一位員工都超級友好，感覺就像回到了自己家一樣温暖。

🏖️海灘：特別要説的是海灘，美得不像話！沙子軟軟的，海水清澈見底，簡直就是拍照打卡的聖地。

🛏️房間：房間也超級棒，乾淨整潔，床鋪軟得讓人不想起來，每晚都能睡個好覺。哈哈哈哈哈哈哈

msg:帶孩子過去度假遊玩，簡直是太好了，酒店在最乾淨的沙灘前，酒店自帶泳池，不論是酒店住宿的舒適度，酒店各方面的服務態度，還是孩子能參與的遊樂設施，在酒店待着就能玩兒幾天不出門。尤其是外圍泳池和遊樂部分的領導和工作人員，能及時發現我們的需求，很在乎每一個住店旅客的感受，非常感謝，孩子玩兒的開心，也對三亞風土人情和喜來登工作人員太滿意，每年有空還回去，還會住這裏。

msg:房間性價比極高，住亞龍灣喜來登從來不擔心衞生，服務更是沒的説，親子旅遊感受到温馨。
去年五月住了大亞灣，亞龍灣，海棠灣，比較下來亞龍灣特別適合親子。
今年住的感受:
1.服務一如既往，孩子的感受温馨
2.房間孩子很喜歡，甄選海景帶陽台，看遠海
3.泳池槳板項目孩子也是玩的開心
4.早餐非常豐富
5.旁邊是東榮美食城，吃飯很方便，租電動車去太陽灣也很近
6.酒店早餐也是風景好又豐盛
7.孩子生日當天送蛋糕到房間，特大驚喜
唯一遺憾的是，玩水滑梯正在維修，少了一些快樂，聽説這幾天就修好了。
整體來説非常不錯。

msg:近些年三次入住亞龍灣喜來登了 幾乎每次來亞龍灣都入住這一家酒店 雖然不新但到處舒適乾淨 這次是第一次帶寶寶出來遊玩 入住泳池房一歲半的寶寶都不願從水裡出來 每天都去海邊呆半天喝喝椰汁挖挖沙子 入住三晚舒服愜意 早餐寶寶能吃的也不少很省心
客房和園區服務一直不錯 比其它酒店親切周到 再帶孩子來還是會選擇亞龍灣喜來登的 乾淨放心

環境: 酒店園林草坪都很有設計感 拍照很出片 成人泳池就在海邊 看着海景游泳 絕對值得體驗


服務: 前台、客房、餐廳服務人員都很熱心 響應及時 很不錯
設施: 老牌酒店開業早，房間設施不夠先進，電視不能投屏，也不是智能馬桶。但在房間呆的時間也不長，我和媽媽都覺得不影響哈哈哈。

msg:錯開51帶小朋友出去玩玩，正好過兩歲生日，開始糾結了周邊好幾家酒店，包括海棠灣的，想着這邊稍微方便些最後他爸決定住喜來登。
先訂了兩天房，本來擔心不太合適後面再換，飛機落地下午5點，打車過去半小時左右，最先安排的房間稍微有點黴味，孩他爸有鼻炎，寶寶又是易過敏體質，給前台打電話立馬帶着看了其他房間，因為2棟沒剩大床房最終換去1棟，個人感覺1棟更方便，樓下就是泳池，住了頂層他爸很滿意，海景園景都不錯，一致決定續房3日，帶着小朋友也不想到處去比較🤨
房間有一次免費迷你吧，小火車隨便坐🤭可惜最後兩天才記起帶寶寶來，中途還貼心電話詢問住房感受，贈送了大堂吧飲品券
5.6天大部分時間都窩在酒店，唯一遺憾的是小童泳池正好第二天就開始擴建沒能玩，沙灘的沙子也不太細軟。草坪和樓下的泳池寶寶都很喜歡，臨走當天還和其他小朋友一起玩了，建議可多增加些低齡小童的親子項目
最後感謝前台小趙帥哥給升級房型和延遲退房等等幫助，謝謝第一天給裝床圍、拿小童用品的靦腆小哥和帶看房的高個小哥，郭瑞阿姨清理得很整潔。可惜沒咋接觸到小姐姐，酒店裡的年輕小夥子們都很👍哈哈哈

禮賓部的小謝，六樓的帥哥美女以及馮主管服務都很貼心，入住的時候又重新洗了遍小泳池，要了奶瓶消毒器 不過是蒸汽的，洗澡護髮素沒了也及時分裝給送過來。
房間設施確實有些年稱了，不過保養得蠻好。唯一的缺點插座很少，床頭一個都沒有
