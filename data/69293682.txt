msg:Exceptional hotel in remarkable location  with private valley walk across the river. Beautifully designed and appointed rooms, stunning landscaping, amazing yet healthy breakfast with quality sourced vegetables and produce. Very attractive location on river. Nice public rooms / sitting area for calming tea on arrival . Or energising coffee … Attentive highly professional staff. Quiet and tranquil. A special place (yet it is expensive) but it is worth it for a very special stay. A place you can truly relax for a day or so.

The service was great. The pictures on CTrip are unable to capture the beauty and quality of the hotel. The private mountain and hiking path along the stream is great. Good restaurant, though it is a little expensive. We’ll definitely return!

The hardware can basically meet the five-star standard, the service is great, and everything is considerate, and the food taste is generally expensive. As a hotel in the mountains, it is acceptable to deal with a meal.
Some rooms are far away, you can ask before check-in.

msg:In the depths of the canyon outside Chongqing, there is a hidden resort hotel, which took 4 years to carefully craft, and its name is Puxiang.
It takes one and a half hours to drive from Chongqing. Along the way down the mountain and up the mountain, the streams, forests, stone bridges gradually come into view... until the Jinfo Mountain scenic spot. The rustic small building wrapped in Wuwa and grass-ash walls, I was really watching her the second I saw her. The whole person relaxed.
The butler and all the service staff have been waiting at the door for a long time. From the beginning to the end, they have maintained a caring service and an appropriate distance. No matter you want to eat, go out, or ask for anything, they will serve you attentively, and all kinds of drinks and snacks are ready for you when you enter the door. The details of the room are all online, ranging from the adjus**ent of the temperature of the hot spring water, from the cotton linen shoes to the pillows and mattresses available at the beginning. Will give you full of kindness and happiness.
Puxiang is entrenched in the Wolongtan Scenic Area of Jinfo Mountain, enjoying deep valleys, quiet pools, and hazy mountains exclusively... The exclusive red iron bridge is like a time shuttle. The second you step into him, it seems to connect the real world and the secret place of Taoyuan.
I never dreamed that when I stepped in this way, what I saw was a line of sky, a waterfall, a quiet lake, and a thousand-year-old tree...
So, I seem to have traveled to a hidden secret place, here, listening to the wind, meditating, relaxing, simmering in the soup pool, talking at night around the stove...
The beauty of creation is only based on nature. In Puxiang, the body and mind can restore the true nature. You are really worth a visit.

You can walk through the sky and ancient trees in half a day. It is said that a cableway will be built not far from the hotel at the north gate at the end of the year, which will be more convenient. The breakfast catering is scientific and rich. It's just that the welcome snacks will be more perfect if they are updated on time. In short, it is the best place for meditation and retreat.

msg:The positioning of this hotel is relatively niche. Says there are only 17 rooms. The location is excellent, at the entrance of Wolongtan Scenic Spot in Jinfo Mountain. Built along the creek, you can see the green hills from the window of the guest room, and the bitan lake when you look down. It can't compare with the magnificence of the Jialing River Canyon outside the window of Bailian, but it also has a delicate style. What's even more amazing is that the Wolongtan scenic spot is inside the hotel, which is equivalent to the hotel's private scenic spot. Only residents can enter and play. There are two routes inside, one is to go upstream along the stream, the terrain is relatively flat, suitable for walking. There is another way to climb the mountain, but the view is not very good after reaching the top, and there is no view.
There is nothing to say about the hotel service, and your license plate will be registered in advance. When the car arrives at the door, service staff will come forward to guide you, and then take you all the way to check in. There will be tea breaks in the few minutes after the formalities are completed, which is a very good feeling.
In terms of rooms, the two lowest-priced tiers do not have terraces or pools. If you really want to live comfortably, you have to start with a mountain view room, the price is a bit expensive.
I think the design of the bubble pool can be optimized. The first is the light, the outline of the eaves illuminates brightly. Although I knew that there was no one on the opposite side of the cliff, I still felt uncomfortable. After communicating with the hotel, the outline lights were quickly turned off. But when I turned on the light on the balcony, it was still brightly lit... I turned off the light, and I couldn't see my fingers again. Fortunately, I was given an emergency light in the shape of an oil lamp. Also, the bubble pool is a bit shallow, less than half a meter by visual inspection, probably to save water.
Breakfast is included in the room rate. There are Chinese and Japanese styles to choose from. We both had one and it was pretty good. Dinner is a combination of Japanese and Chinese cuisine. The taste is also very good.
On weekends, I brought my family to stay here for one night to climb mountains and take a walk. It was quite enjoyable. 😊

It may be the off-season. The saturated service is very meticulous and basically responsive. I contacted in advance to prepare the room and the children's supplies. I reminded the travel precautions and prepared cloth shoes. The Chinese food in the restaurant is quite amazing. The bacon is really outstanding among all kinds of local pig bacon I have eaten.

msg:On the day of check-in, there was a very unpleasant episode. We booked a car from downtown Chongqing to the hotel. After driving for nearly two hours, we were blocked at the entrance of the scenic spot as soon as we entered the Jinfo Mountain scenic spot at around 3 o'clock in the afternoon. It turns out that there are many self-driving cars parked on the side of the road during the holidays, causing serious congestion on the two-way road. Two or three kilometers away from the hotel, the car couldn't get in. I called the hotel, and a lady told me that the congestion had occurred yesterday, and it might get better by 4 or 5 pm after the police cleared it. We had no choice but to get off the car and wait. During the waiting process, the staff of the scenic spot told us that it might not be available until seven or eight in the evening. I called the hotel again and asked if we could send a shuttle bus to pick us up after we walked through the congested road? Only then was informed that the hotel does not have a shuttle bus. I said that since there was congestion yesterday, why not inform the guests who are about to check in in advance so that the guests can arrange their time? The other party's answer was that they were afraid that the guests would have to wait if the room was not vacated if the guests came early. I am very dissatisfied with this kind of answer. Why do you think that the guests think so? Whether the guest decides to come early or late, the hotel has to inform the situation. In the struggle, we decided to walk there first. In this way, my husband and I took our two children and an old man with luggage and walked in the high temperature. Do you think I can feel better? After passing through the congested road, I found an older sister who rode a motorcycle for 10 yuan a time, and took the old lady and eldest daughter to the hotel twice back and forth. During the break, the locals told me that there will be traffic jams here every July and August. At a distance of seven or eight hundred meters from the hotel, a young brother and a lady from the hotel took us back to the hotel. On the way, the lady explained to me that the phone call to me the day before did not get through, and Ctrip sent a text message to inform of possible traffic. situation. Later, I checked specifically, and I didn't see any messages or missed calls.
Let’s talk about the check-in experience. The entire building and room style of the hotel are Japanese-style. The rooms are simple and comfortable, and the hotel’s scenery is unique and small. Although the hotel has only 18 rooms in total, its treasure lies in the hotel’s "private" back mountain with beautiful scenery. , the loudest sound comes from cicadas and running water. The breakfast buffet is small, so don't expect a great variety. The Chinese food tastes very good (Japanese food is not ordered), and I personally think it is better than Chongqing Bolian and Banyan Tree Chinese food. As for whether I will come again, maybe not, I would rather go to Jinyun Mountain.

msg:I thought that a room costing 3,200 a night in a place like this was very high-end and was standard for a small villa, but it turned out to be a double bed room in an ordinary hotel. It's not worth paying 3200 for a room on the roadside. The big cars are very loud and noisy. The roar of the big cars passing by has made the whole day noisy. It is even more noisy when sleeping at night. The hotel waiters are poorly trained, unenthusiastic and snobbish, and the service is not very satisfactory. I have stayed in many similar Japanese-style hotels, and the facilities are better than here. The details of the rooms are more Japanese-style than here, and the butler service is very user-friendly and not too noisy. Including Japanese-style service, the standard is higher than here, and the price/performance ratio is higher than here. The condition of this room, compared to the room price of about 1,000 at most, is not worth the 3,200 room price standard. So I suggested reading the reviews and not booking this room in the future. I won’t necessarily regret it. Thank you!

Secondly, the hotel opened not long ago, the facilities are still relatively new, and the grade is also in line with the positioning. Finally, although there is only one restaurant, the food is good and the quality matches the price. It's a pity that it seems that the soup pool is not a hot spring or a boiler water, and the location is also indoors, unlike the soup pools of Bei Hot Spring Bailian, which are all on the terrace, and the a**osphere feels better. In general, it is estimated that in the future, when you come to Jinfo Mountain to spend summer or play in the snow, you will choose this place.

Although the hotel is not large and there is only one restaurant, the choice of dishes is diverse, whether it is Japanese, Teppanyaki, Western food, Cantonese food, Chinese food... The two especially like to eat Japanese food and teppanyaki. During the chat with the chef, they learned that the thick-cut beef tongue is a domestic brand. The taste and oil aroma are very amazing. It's delicious, but it's much inferior to the snowflake beef. In the future, I will choose the same brand as the beef tongue, like the filet mignon in the store. Very thirsty all night.
🍳Breakfast has Japanese and Chinese choices. We chose one each. The portion is very enough to eat. I would like to talk about Japanese dishes. The overall proportion of 3 pieces of fish is a bit too much. I am used to eating breakfast in Japan. It is served with rice, but the restaurant said that it needs to be informed the day before, so you can pay attention, and the salmon is too fishy, and the eel should be vacuum-packed, so it is better to use more fresh seasonal ingredients to make boiled or stewed things.
☀️After breakfast, go to the hotel's private valley for a walk 👣 In summer, you can also trace the creek and chase fireflies 🏕
⛰ Surrounded by mountains, gurgling streams, extremely ethereal and Zen, maybe this is the mood the hotel wants to bring to its guests🐞

To sum up: there is no disadvantage other than expensive, of course, expensive is not its problem, expensive is our own problem, haha.

A little suggestion: Since tea is prepared in the room, why not prepare a set of simple Kung Fu tea set, making tea in a big cup still feels a little lack of soul

3. The service is not bad. From check-in to meal to check-out, there are staff warmly serviced. It can be seen that the service concept is deeply rooted in the hotel.
There are also disadvantages:
1. The room area is not large, at most 40 square meters, which does not match this price.
2. The service details are not enough. The Chinese-style black tea ordered in the coffee shop is not brewed with a tea set, but with a mug. The turndown does not put water and water cups by the bed. These details are still not enough.
3 The advantages and disadvantages of catering are outstanding. The breakfast is very rich and has many varieties, but hard dishes such as steak and papaya snow clams are really not suitable for breakfast. The quality of the a la carte dishes for lunch and dinner is alright, but the prices are a bit unfriendly and far from the value of the dishes themselves.
4. Lack of gym.
Hope to do better.

早餐分中式和日式兩種可選，中式分量會更多有各種麪點、粥和麪條，日式稍微便宜點有各種很精緻的小菜和烏冬面，公區還有自助的牛奶豆漿咖啡茶，麪包水果……
午餐晚餐需要提前預訂，都是在精緻的小包房，鐵板燒非常贊，老鴨湯也很好喝。
公共設施不多，有一個茶水吧可以喝喝咖啡飲料，還有一個雪茄咖啡吧，主要用於看書喝茶。住了兩天體驗感非常好，有什麼需要管家都響應很快。準備二刷。

酒店的餐食綜合看很一般，與安縵比還有不少距離，但重慶小麪非常好吃。。。

床墊是金可兒的天夢之床，實話説，對我來説偏軟了點

備品如牙刷牙膏等不夠高檔，與酒店的定位不太匹配。。。

即使有上面的一些不足，但這家酒店的環境，個性化的服務要好於國內四家安縵中的任何一家。所以我還是給該酒店滿分好評！

msg:很失望，1.酒店景區年久未維護，步行道青苔，小孩長者都容易摔倒，蒼蠅滿天飛。2.酒店餐廳又貴又難吃，服務員態度也不好，普通四星都趕不上3.電吹風看着手感的，結果很不好用，床太軟了，全家腰都算了，4.一共10多間房間，餐廳都沒有足夠位置，不提前定還不能就餐，5.除了住宿完全沒酒店任何活動，螢火蟲根本沒有，去河溝都是自己出去野河溝耍，6.服務員見人都愛搭不理的，再也不去了。

msg:衹能説明重慶的度假酒店太少了，這個性價比太低太低，從選址和體驗來説，老闆應該還是用心的，或者是想用心的，但是，比起江浙滬一帶同價位的酒店，性價比太低！3000多元的房間，房間佈局和硬件設施都很一般，無品牌無設計感，公共區域努力在營造氛圍，但不得精髓，除了選址外酒店本身無亮點。
