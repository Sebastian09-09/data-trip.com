Good restaurant, though it is a little expensive. We‚Äôll definitely return!

msg:In the depths of the canyon outside Chongqing, there is a hidden resort hotel, which took 4 years to carefully craft, and its name is Puxiang.
It takes one and a half hours to drive from Chongqing. Along the way down the mountain and up the mountain, the streams, forests, stone bridges gradually come into view... until the Jinfo Mountain scenic spot. The rustic small building wrapped in Wuwa and grass-ash walls, I was really watching her the second I saw her. The whole person relaxed.
The butler and all the service staff have been waiting at the door for a long time. From the beginning to the end, they have maintained a caring service and an appropriate distance. No matter you want to eat, go out, or ask for anything, they will serve you attentively, and all kinds of drinks and snacks are ready for you when you enter the door. The details of the room are all online, ranging from the adjus**ent of the temperature of the hot spring water, from the cotton linen shoes to the pillows and mattresses available at the beginning. Will give you full of kindness and happiness.
Puxiang is entrenched in the Wolongtan Scenic Area of Jinfo Mountain, enjoying deep valleys, quiet pools, and hazy mountains exclusively... The exclusive red iron bridge is like a time shuttle. The second you step into him, it seems to connect the real world and the secret place of Taoyuan.
I never dreamed that when I stepped in this way, what I saw was a line of sky, a waterfall, a quiet lake, and a thousand-year-old tree...
So, I seem to have traveled to a hidden secret place, here, listening to the wind, meditating, relaxing, simmering in the soup pool, talking at night around the stove...
The beauty of creation is only based on nature. In Puxiang, the body and mind can restore the true nature. You are really worth a visit.

You can walk through the sky and ancient trees in half a day. It is said that a cableway will be built not far from the hotel at the north gate at the end of the year, which will be more convenient. The breakfast catering is scientific and rich. It's just that the welcome snacks will be more perfect if they are updated on time. In short, it is the best place for meditation and retreat.

msg:The positioning of this hotel is relatively niche. Says there are only 17 rooms. The location is excellent, at the entrance of Wolongtan Scenic Spot in Jinfo Mountain. Built along the creek, you can see the green hills from the window of the guest room, and the bitan lake when you look down. It can't compare with the magnificence of the Jialing River Canyon outside the window of Bailian, but it also has a delicate style. What's even more amazing is that the Wolongtan scenic spot is inside the hotel, which is equivalent to the hotel's private scenic spot. Only residents can enter and play. There are two routes inside, one is to go upstream along the stream, the terrain is relatively flat, suitable for walking. There is another way to climb the mountain, but the view is not very good after reaching the top, and there is no view.
There is nothing to say about the hotel service, and your license plate will be registered in advance. When the car arrives at the door, service staff will come forward to guide you, and then take you all the way to check in. There will be tea breaks in the few minutes after the formalities are completed, which is a very good feeling.
In terms of rooms, the two lowest-priced tiers do not have terraces or pools. If you really want to live comfortably, you have to start with a mountain view room, the price is a bit expensive.
I think the design of the bubble pool can be optimized. The first is the light, the outline of the eaves illuminates brightly. Although I knew that there was no one on the opposite side of the cliff, I still felt uncomfortable. After communicating with the hotel, the outline lights were quickly turned off. But when I turned on the light on the balcony, it was still brightly lit... I turned off the light, and I couldn't see my fingers again. Fortunately, I was given an emergency light in the shape of an oil lamp. Also, the bubble pool is a bit shallow, less than half a meter by visual inspection, probably to save water.
Breakfast is included in the room rate. There are Chinese and Japanese styles to choose from. We both had one and it was pretty good. Dinner is a combination of Japanese and Chinese cuisine. The taste is also very good.
On weekends, I brought my family to stay here for one night to climb mountains and take a walk. It was quite enjoyable. üòä

msg:On the day of check-in, there was a very unpleasant episode. We booked a car from downtown Chongqing to the hotel. After driving for nearly two hours, we were blocked at the entrance of the scenic spot as soon as we entered the Jinfo Mountain scenic spot at around 3 o'clock in the afternoon. It turns out that there are many self-driving cars parked on the side of the road during the holidays, causing serious congestion on the two-way road. Two or three kilometers away from the hotel, the car couldn't get in. I called the hotel, and a lady told me that the congestion had occurred yesterday, and it might get better by 4 or 5 pm after the police cleared it. We had no choice but to get off the car and wait. During the waiting process, the staff of the scenic spot told us that it might not be available until seven or eight in the evening. I called the hotel again and asked if we could send a shuttle bus to pick us up after we walked through the congested road? Only then was informed that the hotel does not have a shuttle bus. I said that since there was congestion yesterday, why not inform the guests who are about to check in in advance so that the guests can arrange their time? The other party's answer was that they were afraid that the guests would have to wait if the room was not vacated if the guests came early. I am very dissatisfied with this kind of answer. Why do you think that the guests think so? Whether the guest decides to come early or late, the hotel has to inform the situation. In the struggle, we decided to walk there first. In this way, my husband and I took our two children and an old man with luggage and walked in the high temperature. Do you think I can feel better? After passing through the congested road, I found an older sister who rode a motorcycle for 10 yuan a time, and took the old lady and eldest daughter to the hotel twice back and forth. During the break, the locals told me that there will be traffic jams here every July and August. At a distance of seven or eight hundred meters from the hotel, a young brother and a lady from the hotel took us back to the hotel. On the way, the lady explained to me that the phone call to me the day before did not get through, and Ctrip sent a text message to inform of possible traffic. situation. Later, I checked specifically, and I didn't see any messages or missed calls.
Let‚Äôs talk about the check-in experience. The entire building and room style of the hotel are Japanese-style. The rooms are simple and comfortable, and the hotel‚Äôs scenery is unique and small. Although the hotel has only 18 rooms in total, its treasure lies in the hotel‚Äôs "private" back mountain with beautiful scenery. , the loudest sound comes from cicadas and running water. The breakfast buffet is small, so don't expect a great variety. The Chinese food tastes very good (Japanese food is not ordered), and I personally think it is better than Chongqing Bolian and Banyan Tree Chinese food. As for whether I will come again, maybe not, I would rather go to Jinyun Mountain.

msg:I thought that a room costing 3,200 a night in a place like this was very high-end and was standard for a small villa, but it turned out to be a double bed room in an ordinary hotel. It's not worth paying 3200 for a room on the roadside. The big cars are very loud and noisy. The roar of the big cars passing by has made the whole day noisy. It is even more noisy when sleeping at night. The hotel waiters are poorly trained, unenthusiastic and snobbish, and the service is not very satisfactory. I have stayed in many similar Japanese-style hotels, and the facilities are better than here. The details of the rooms are more Japanese-style than here, and the butler service is very user-friendly and not too noisy. Including Japanese-style service, the standard is higher than here, and the price/performance ratio is higher than here. The condition of this room, compared to the room price of about 1,000 at most, is not worth the 3,200 room price standard. So I suggested reading the reviews and not booking this room in the future. I won‚Äôt necessarily regret it. Thank you!

Secondly, the hotel opened not long ago, the facilities are still relatively new, and the grade is also in line with the positioning. Finally, although there is only one restaurant, the food is good and the quality matches the price. It's a pity that it seems that the soup pool is not a hot spring or a boiler water, and the location is also indoors, unlike the soup pools of Bei Hot Spring Bailian, which are all on the terrace, and the a**osphere feels better. In general, it is estimated that in the future, when you come to Jinfo Mountain to spend summer or play in the snow, you will choose this place.

Although the hotel is not large and there is only one restaurant, the choice of dishes is diverse, whether it is Japanese, Teppanyaki, Western food, Cantonese food, Chinese food... The two especially like to eat Japanese food and teppanyaki. During the chat with the chef, they learned that the thick-cut beef tongue is a domestic brand. The taste and oil aroma are very amazing. It's delicious, but it's much inferior to the snowflake beef. In the future, I will choose the same brand as the beef tongue, like the filet mignon in the store. Very thirsty all night.
üç≥Breakfast has Japanese and Chinese choices. We chose one each. The portion is very enough to eat. I would like to talk about Japanese dishes. The overall proportion of 3 pieces of fish is a bit too much. I am used to eating breakfast in Japan. It is served with rice, but the restaurant said that it needs to be informed the day before, so you can pay attention, and the salmon is too fishy, and the eel should be vacuum-packed, so it is better to use more fresh seasonal ingredients to make boiled or stewed things.

‚õ∞ Surrounded by mountains, gurgling streams, extremely ethereal and Zen, maybe this is the mood the hotel wants to bring to its guestsüêû

msg:1: The service is great, the staff are very enthusiastic, and they will take the initiative to help you. When checking in/out, there are 3 people to help you. In fact, we don't have any luggage, so I'm sorry.
2: The private canyon is great, and I haven't seen anyone after an hour of walking. The view after the rain is beautiful. There are bottled water and umbrellas on the way, which is very intimate.
3: Both dinner and breakfast are delicious, and the level of dinner is not inferior to that of a star-rated hotel chef.
4: On my wife's birthday, the hotel has carefully arranged everything from the room to the dining room. There was also a birthday cake for dinner. Praise!

To sum up: there is no disadvantage other than expensive, of course, expensive is not its problem, expensive is our own problem, haha.

A little suggestion: Since tea is prepared in the room, why not prepare a set of simple Kung Fu tea set, making tea in a big cup still feels a little lack of soul

msg:As a good hotel in Chongqing, it is necessary to give a good review.
The advantages first:
1. The environment of the hotel is very good. There is an exclusive canyon scenic spot at the back, which is quiet and original.
2. The landscape gardens in the hotel area seem to have taken great effort. Although the hotel is not big, the gardens are still relatively delicate.
3. The service is not bad. From check-in to meal to check-out, there are staff warmly serviced. It can be seen that the service concept is deeply rooted in the hotel.
There are also disadvantages:
1. The room area is not large, at most 40 square meters, which does not match this price.
2. The service details are not enough. The Chinese-style black tea ordered in the coffee shop is not brewed with a tea set, but with a mug. The turndown does not put water and water cups by the bed. These details are still not enough.
3 The advantages and disadvantages of catering are outstanding. The breakfast is very rich and has many varieties, but hard dishes such as steak and papaya snow clams are really not suitable for breakfast. The quality of the a la carte dishes for lunch and dinner is alright, but the prices are a bit unfriendly and far from the value of the dishes themselves.
4. Lack of gym.
Hope to do better.

There was no one at the front desk in the middle of the night. The lights in the hotel were also dim. Highly not recommended
