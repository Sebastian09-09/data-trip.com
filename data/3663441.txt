msg:We had an amazing staycation at this hotspring resort. I was very impressed with the customer service we recieved. Everyone was incredibly kind and went out of their way to help. The staff has clearly had 5 star training.

 I would like to make particular note of Mr. Lee at the front desk. Upon check-in, he served us and acknowledged that not all the staff spoke English and that we should contact him directly over Wechat if we needed anything. On several occassions I contacted him and he was prompt and curtious. He was a great ambassador for the hotel. For example, room service forgot chicken on on salad, and he promptly pologized and arranged for two new compelmentary salads to be sent (i believe this was an oversight as the hotel was very busy with a special chiristmas dinner that night). 

It is common in Beijing for hotel staff not to speak English, however we did found several memebers of staff that did. For example. when we went to the dining hall, they sent an English speaker over to help us. Further, the dining hall manager checked in with us and personally cleared plates away. Buffet breakfast was above average with western and chinese food. Also, when ordering room service, though they did not speak English, they sent someone to our room with a menu so that we could point to the items we wanted. 

Overall, the hotel is new and to Western standards of cleanliness and quality. Beds and pillows were comfortable. We were with my 2 month old baby and my 85 year old father, all generations enjoyed our time. The hot springs were very clean (not always the case in China) and they were alongside swimming pools with kids climbing apparatice and water ball pit. It was also nice that there were complementary refreshments (snacks and drinks) at the hot springs. In the winter air, the outdoor hotsprings were great. 

Finally., though it wasnt a huge attraction, its nice to see the lammas, chicken and horses. 

Overall, I could not recommend this place more. I will defintely stay again.

msg:This hotel is pretty good. I wanted to find a hotel that had a warm kids pool so I could take my daughter to swim. The kids pool is pretty big and the temperature is perfect. As you can only enter the hot spring area once, I was able to let my daughter nap on my lap while my husband and I had some fruit and drinks at the seated area without having to leave the hot springs. 

The room is spacious and mostly clean. However, I wouldn't say this hotel is 5 stars. The decoration is outdated and needs to undergo refurbishment. The bath was dirty and had lots of things floating in it when we filled it up with water, so we had to empty and refill before washing in it. Then, when drying my daughter's hair with the hairdryer in the bathroom, the hallway light keep flickering and the hairdryer was cutting off. It seems there was some electrical problem with the socket. It started to make a spark noise and smelt like burning, so we had to quickly unplug the hairdryer for fear of it going on fire.

The location is in the middle of nowhere, so it's not convenient if you want to buy food or snacks. i personally didn't like the hotel breakfast. It doesn't compare to other international brand hotel standards. 

Overall, it would a pleasant stay, but only because it was suitable for my daughter to swim..

Various parent-child activities are well organized and colorful. The hotel is equipped with hot springs. During the May Day holiday, there were not many people in the hot springs, and it was very comfortable to soak in. The house area is not small, clean and tidy, and comfortable to stay. The service is very good. When checking in, she saw that there were two elderly people and children. Manager Zhao Feng thoughtfully upgraded our room. The room is more spacious and the bed is enough. During the stay, she often asked if we had any needs. Our family was very happy to stay. I recommend staying here and will come again next time.

First, it was still open a few minutes after 21:00 in the evening, but the guide at the door told me that I couldn't order food. Second, the promotional page in the guest room said that the cafe could get a 20 yuan discount for ordering Hainanese chicken rice with the room card. The staff who checked twice denied it until I told her the third time that it was written in the guest room advertisement and she checked it before returning the extra 20 yuan to me. Third, the room package came with a 6-inch cake. I made a reservation in advance at more than 6 o'clock, and the staff said that I could pick it up at 8 or 9 o'clock. I arrived at the cafe at 9 o'clock, but they said that the cake was out. After waiting for 25 minutes, I made a box of hard-to-swallow gelatin mousse. Restaurant (cafe) 0 points. Others 5 points.

During the May Day holiday, many hot spring hotels raised their prices ridiculously, but this hotel did not increase its prices significantly. The price of such a good hot spring hotel on May Day was really a surprise. Dabao and Xiaobao are eight years apart in age. They each have their own favorite spots to play here. They all had a lot of fun and fed the cute alpacas. We will definitely go again. Lee, the manager on duty at the front desk, is very responsible and will remind you of the key points in advance.

After arriving, I wanted to upgrade the children's room because I was traveling with my grandparents. The two rooms I booked had to be close to each other to facilitate the care of the elderly. Manager Huo from the concierge depar**ent patiently helped me choose adjacent rooms throughout the process. He also carefully informed me of the hot spring time, dining time, etc. The hot spring is very large, and the children had a lot of fun. There is also a hot spring pool suitable for the elderly. There are both Chinese and Western restaurants in the hotel. The food is very complete and the price is reasonable. Five people didn't finish the meal for more than 500 yuan. It's quite cost-effective. The children's playground is small, but it is also good for children to relax. There are ponies and alpacas at the door. We brought our own rabbits, walked the rabbits and flew kites. It was a happy holiday.

For one reason, the package says there is a children's breakfast, two large and one small hot spring, but the child must be under 1.2m, but if you don't choose the package and book the room directly, the breakfast for children under 1.2m is also free; if you buy a separate ticket to the hot spring, children under 1.2m are also free. Why is it considered a free item in the package? What kind of word game is being played? There is no sincerity at all. Isn't this a fraud? It's still a five-star hotel. If you want to charge, you can be fair and honest, not to mention giving a small one.
In addition, as a five-star hotel, the swimming pool is actually inside the hot spring, and you can't swim without a ticket.

The hot spring is very good and there are many pools, which are enough for children to play. Although there are only two slides, there are many ocean balls in the big pool, which is enough for my family to play in. All day long. 4. The outdoor swimming pool is very good. It happened to be snowing. It was really amazing! 5. The hotel breakfast is quite rich. 6. Compared to popular places, there are fewer people here. 7. They provide skin care lotions and so on. Although they are not big brands, they can still be used.
Disadvantages: 1. The hot spring does not provide hot spring clothes, so you need to bring your own;
2. Bath towels can only be taken from the laundry area. 3. You can only see different colors in various hot springs, but there is no fruity or medicinal aroma. I don’t know if it is true... 4. The bath water in the room is not hot enough. 5. The food in the Chinese restaurant is relatively expensive, and the accommodation is 20% off a la carte, so I buy a set meal, but the set meal is not that delicious, a bit like pre-made dishes. Hope it improves.
Suggestion: Can ******* medicinal bath be added.
Will continue to go!

From the night before check-in, we communicated all matters by phone, including early check-in, children's breakfast and hot springs, and also put children's dental equipment in the room in advance. The day of check-in went very smoothly. The family was satisfied with soaking in the hot springs for most of the day, and the children had a great time playing in the swimming pool.
The room is clean and tidy. The two beds in the standard room are 1.35 meters tall. There is no problem in sleeping in one bed and one bed.
I originally wanted to experience the buffet dinner, but there was a group reservation that day. I hope I have the opportunity next time.

The service here is very good. We were received by Sam in the front office. The guy is quite enthusiastic and the service is super good and very considerate in every aspect.

Walking through the end of a village, a castle-like hotel has a dreamlike view, as if you have entered a fairy tale world. The lobby is magnificent, and the perfect decoration of white and gold shows nobility and elegance. The service is warm and tries to satisfy everyone. Demand, the elevator card swiping is safe and responsible, the customer service is as shown in the picture, the space is large, hygienic and clean, dry and wet are separated, and the view is wide. The hot spring is not big, but it has all the necessary facilities. The environment is green and green, the water is clean, and the outside is very elegant. It is very artistic especially at night, with a small fish pond, and free snacks, fruits and tea. Dined at the Chinese restaurant in the evening. The service was warm. The key is that the ingredients are authentic and taste good. The breakfast is rich and enough to meet everyone's needs. The most touching thing is to learn that everything was done as shown in the picture after the birthday. The room The decoration and the presentation of the cake were very warm! I want to say from the bottom of my heart that for a hotel that has been open for 6 years, both the details and decoration have been well maintained! All harshness should be put into perspective! Also: The bedding is very good, there are a variety of pillows to choose from, and the comfort is extremely high! Very quiet at night! If you are bringing children, there are many parent-child activities. Even after staying for two nights, you still feel like you haven’t had enough fun! Will definitely go again! In the off-season, it is definitely a very cost-effective place! Perhaps the only shortcoming is that the sound insulation effect is slightly poor! But no one is perfect, no matter how big or small it is, if you accept everything with an inclusive heart, you will have endless joy! Will definitely go again...thank you to all the hotel staff! I wish you a prosperous business!

msg:This is a hotel that has been recommended a lot online recently. Overall it’s very good.
I came here with my children and elderly people to stay for two days over the weekend. The hotel is very beautiful and looks like a European castle. I called the front desk in advance and arranged a bed for the room. I brought children's toiletries and bathrobes. The room was clean and tidy, and fruits were given as a gift.
There are more than a dozen indoor and outdoor hot spring pools in the hotel. Children love the children's pool, and there is an unlimited supply of snacks, fruits and drinks.
There are alpacas, rabbits and geese outside. You can feed the small animals up close if you buy carrots. The children drove the go-kart several times, which was very enjoyable. There is also a children's playground next to the hot spring, which can liberate parents.
The only negative comment is for the restaurant. There are so many people for breakfast on weekends, but there are very few choices, and there is nothing to eat. Dinner was at a Chinese restaurant. It was a very bad experience. There were only about 20 tables in total. I had to queue up when I arrived late. The food was served very slowly. It took an average of 15-20 minutes to serve a dish. Every table was busy with the food but it was not served. It took more than an hour for the three dishes to be served. In the end, I couldn't bear the next dish and didn't want the next dish. I just paid the bill. Let's go out to eat.

The hotel looks like a castle, which kids will love. The room is large and the scenery outside is beautiful. Downstairs there are alpaca feeding, crafts, claw machines, and children's entertainment room. You can play everything without going out.
The room includes a hot spring ticket, which has a swimming pool and a children's water slide. It is my son's favorite and he has played it more than 80 times. The water temperature is very suitable. I didn't take a bath in the hot spring because I had children. It still looks very good, both indoors and outdoors. There is also a spa on the second floor. Fruits and machine drinks are free. Although they are not very high-end, they are enough to satisfy your hunger and satisfy your cravings.
All in all, it’s great! Very cost-effective! Recommended for families with children!

There are many places for children to interact in the lobby of the hotel. They can clip dolls, gashapon toys, and learn to make noodle dolls, etc.
The hot springs are very good, both indoors and outdoors. There is also a swimming pool (you need to wear a swimming cap to enter the water), and children will not have to worry about playing. There is a large children's pool with a low water level and a lot of bubble balls. There is also a small children's pool in the corner with two small slides. very interesting.

The European-style decoration style, the scenery in the morning is not bad, and there is a large lawn directly opposite the hotel, where you can play Frisbee.
In the evening, there is a barbecue outside the main entrance, and you can also ride horses, feed alpacas, and go-kart.
There are not many people in the gym, and most people go to the hot springs. There are quite a lot of hot spring pools, and there are many places for children to play. It is worth visiting if you bring children.
Just arrived at the hotel and added the WeChat account of the housekeeper Xu Xinyang. The whole process of service is very good, and I respond positively to any questions. I help arrange bed sharing and extra bed surrounds, and quickly solve them. Praise!

I personally think that the outdoors feel better. Drinks, snacks, and fruits are provided.

Looking at the pictures, the appearance of this hotel is very similar to the filming castle of the richest man in Xihong City in Yantai. I plan to experience it. I chose to live here after the show that day. The room is big and bright, and the Marvel-themed boys love it the most.
Hygiene: The bedding is very clean, with different pillows, and there are even bunk beds and small tents that can be changed.
Environment: A lot of water, drinks and snacks are delivered, and the double bathrooms also have a round bathtub, so you can take a soak when you are tired.
Services: There is a treadmill in the room, a gym on the first floor, a large VR on B1, and independent indoor and outdoor hot spring baths. The front desk can even bring carrots to the yard to feed alpacas. These items are all free, great!

Finally, I would like to thank the housekeeper Yang Shuyun, who actively applied for a free upgrade of the Bear room to a Marvel room. The whole process of caring service, need to cut watermelon, send a knife, feel uncomfortable, send a thermometer and water, pay attention to whether the breakfast is ready, and help solve troubles when taking a hot spring. This kind of point-to-point service management model is great. Because I had fun and the children were satisfied, I wrote this Ctrip review carefully, and I look forward to coming here again for vacation next time!

It is very good, and the taste is nothing to say. Thanks to Zhang Shuiying, the manager of the restaurant. A child did not go downstairs for breakfast. She helped provide a lunch box for the child to bring back some breakfast bread. Thank you very much. The hot springs in the hotel are quite big. There are many indoor and outdoor bubble pools, and there are also children's paddling pools. Some pools are very happy for children to put foam on, and some pools blow bubbles from above with a bubble gun. It's really interesting.

The water park is very suitable for two children to play. There are a pair of slides and bubbles are made regularly. The two children play for two hours and consume enough power. There are fruit buns and various drinks in the dining bar, all free of charge.

There is also a children's playground on the first floor. Although it is not big, the slides and ocean balls are enough for children to go crazy.

The overall sanitation is very clean, and it is friendly to clean freaks like me.

The variety of breakfast dishes is slightly lacking. But also very good.

It takes less than an hour to arrive from Beijing. The traffic is convenient and not too tiring. The "drivers" expressed their satisfaction🤭
The shape of the hotel is a huge castle, which is gorgeous, spacious and bright. It is especially beautiful when the lights are on at night, and the children like it very much. I experienced the hotel's hot springs and swimming. There are not too many people. The hot springs are divided into indoors and outdoors. The water quality is relatively clean. Free fruits and drinks are also provided. You can replenish them at any time when you are tired. The large lawn at the entrance can be used for camping 🏕, flying kites, riding horses, playing ball, fluttering butterflies 🦋, and feeding alpacas 🦙. The hotel package provides a bag 🥕, and you can also bring some vegetables by yourself. Anyway, it’s fun, and the kids like it😄
Finally, the hotel's service is a highlight. The entire hotel staff, from the front desk to the room service staff, are very nice. The hotel has a welcome fruit plate and tremella soup. In particular, our housekeeper Jiao Weiwei and the restaurant manager Zhang Shuiying are considerate and meticulous.

Recommend this hotel, find some time to chat with family and friends, take a walk, really happy life 😊☀

After comparison, Ctrip’s price is more suitable. It is very suitable for children to play and naughty. Fort and hot springs have a buffet on Friday and Saturday nights. We had Western food for 238 yuan. The lamb chops are highly recommended. Parking is free! There is a very large lawn at the door so that the baby will not fall, and there are ponies for riding. When checking in, I was lucky enough to meet a beautiful customer service, her name is Sun Zihui, her English name is Nicole. She gave us a detailed introduction to the hotel, meal times, and where to play with the baby. Wait, it’s very welcoming. It’s really the service standard of a five-star hotel. I give it a thumbs up!

Going out is the hot spring! Whether it is indoors or outdoors, it will make people linger and forget to return. During the tiring journey, the hot spring brings not only physical and mental relaxation, but also joyful conversation. It seems that at this moment, human beings are connected with the earth and feel the gratitude brought by nature.

msg:There are a lot of people coming over on the day of May Day. We check in at one o'clock, put down our things and go to play. The room is tidied up at about four o'clock. Alpacas, rabbits and lambs can be fed. There is a small ocean ball in the room, which is enough for my second treasure to play with. The hot springs are not bad. There are also free drinks and small pastries indoors and outdoors. The breakfast is also quite a variety and tastes good. The room we booked is a double bed, two big and two small. The bed is very spacious. The bed is hard and comfortable. Finally, I would like to thank the manager Ding who checked in in the lobby for personally bringing the children's slippers and toothbrush bathrobes we needed when he was so busy. The delivery was delivered the next day and a delayed service was provided. In fact, I think that in a hotel, you can have some small mistakes. For example, there were too many guests on the day we came and the service staff was busy, but at this time, staff like Manager Ding will put It’s good that our unhappy mood has been wiped away... I also carefully observed every employee in your hotel when I was playing with the children in the lobby. They are very enthusiastic. It feels good. I wish you a prosperous business

But there are free self-service fruits, pastries, and drinks inside. There are swimming pools and outdoor hot springs in the hot spring pavilion. The dinner buffet was okay, there were not as many people as imagined, beer, red wine, and ice cream were all free and wireless, and the room was upgraded with a Marvel theme, and the boy was very pleasantly surprised! Egg rolls and vegetable picking rolls were given away, and the baby’s leisure and relaxation time also increased a lot of knowledge in the vegetable field! The manager Huo on duty is even more thoughtful and enthusiastic. Before the trip, he took pains to arrange a room type package that is more suitable for us. After arriving at the store, he will inform you of various precautions in advance. The crowded May Day is a relatively good experience.

After playing all the content in the package, I went to experience picking again the next day. Picking is very fun, and it allows children to learn about plants. It is all perceptual knowledge, and it is very fulfilling in short.
The facilities in the room are relatively good, which can meet the needs of this trip. The bed is very good. The child fell asleep and slept until dawn.
The breakfast is very rich and there are many people. If you don't rush to the holiday, the experience should be better. Breakfast is the most satisfying.
Thanks to Lee, the manager on duty, who reminded me of meals and precautions on WeChat during the stay.
There will be a second brush this year, try to avoid the peak period.

The European architectural style is very pleasing, and there are bouncy castles for children. Horseback riding activities and watching on the green lawn in the hotel's scenic area, and watching and feeding of cute alpacas are not only liked by children, but also by adults and the elderly. The hotel's hot spring facilities are well-equipped with indoor and outdoor hot spring pools, with a variety of varieties. The hot spring pool is equipped with snacks, drinks and fruits, which is very considerate. This time, the hotel package with the family and the elderly includes buffet breakfast, dinner, and the hot spring hotel also provides picking and egg picking activities. The hotel's buffet breakfast and buffet dinner are very rich and delicious. This holiday outing has won unanimous praise and approval from the elderly at home. I had a great time and let the elderly eat, drink and have fun. This is my purpose for this trip as a junior. The success of this trip is inseparable from Manager Huo's meticulous arrangements. Here I would like to thank Manager Huo in particular. Manager Huo communicated with me immediately after seeing my order from Ctrip. When I received the call, I felt warm in my heart. Manager Huo also gave very good advice, and under the careful and meticulous arrangement of Manager Huo, I used it This time I led the whole family to travel, which was highly recognized by the elders.

msg:The A-flu is over and the weather is just right, so continue to bring your baby to experience the parent-child hotels in Beijing.
Today I came to Macrolink Lijing Hot Spring Hotel. I ordered a set meal in advance and started on Saturday.
It takes an hour and 40 minutes to drive from the Northwest Third Ring Road, and there is a bit of traffic jam on weekends.
There are free parking lots above and below the hotel.
The hotel looks like a big castle from a distance, and the children like it very much.
facility:
The facilities are a bit old, the room is quite big, but unfortunately there is no terrace.
The two single beds can be pushed together, which is a bit larger than the double room.
There is no beverage minibar in the small refrigerator, which is different from the previous ones.
The hot spring is not big, there are not many people, and there are free snacks and drinks. There is a small children's area, and the children still like it. The water temperature is good.
The children's paradise is really a bit small, and the children have to leave after playing for 10 minutes. . .
health:
The rooms are fully carpeted and look a bit dirty.
Found a dead cockroach in the hot spring area. . .
environment:
There is a large lawn at the entrance of the hotel, where you can fly kites and play frisbee, and there are two alpacas, remember to bring some carrots.
Serve:
The service is good, and the staff Zhao Feng is meticulous in the service. From the check-in to the return visit, I am very satisfied, praise. Sent fruit, pear soup and a little rabbit.
The breakfast is quite rich, the restaurant is quite big, and there are too many people to sit down.
Not counting the picking, 10 catties of vegetables came back with a full load, but many of them were not fully ripe and a bit small.
The overall feeling is that the hotel is trying to be parent-child, but the hardware may not be up to par. It is suggested that some children's activities can be arranged, and it may be better to take the children to play.

msg:The environment is good, the air is fresh, and the surrounding area is slightly desolate, but there are open green lawns and cute small zoos in the park, which are enough for children to play. The hot spring facilities are complete and you can use everything you want. This season is strongly recommended to go outdoors. It is neither cold nor hot and very refreshing, and the production rate is extremely high. The quality of the food is very good. I have eaten both Chinese and Western food. Personally, I prefer Western food, because there are a lot of wine and drinks, and it is suitable for a lively dinner with a big family. The matching parent-child entertainment is also very good. The children can still paint and do archaeology quietly after being in the hot spring, which really moved the old mother. The service is very warm, from the guest room to the hot spring to the dining bar, everything is warm. The two babies also met many smiling sisters and brothers. A cake was specially arranged for the baby's birthday, which is really very loving. In particular, I have to manually praise Manager Huo and Qiu Qiu, they are very considerate and thoughtful. There are many troubles when taking the two children out to play, but they are not irritable at all, and they also help solve problems in various ways, and always care about them. I really hope that all parent-child hotels can be so good and professional, so we can really come to vacation~

msg:Nice family hotel, the building is very a**ospheric, children can drive electric cars to play on the first floor. When I went there in the afternoon, there were too many people in the hot springs, and when there were fewer people at dinner time, just put on your swimsuit and bathrobe and go. It is recommended to find the location of the hot spring center on the first floor after check-in, and then find the nearest elevator, so as to avoid the embarrassment of wearing a bathrobe in the lobby on the first floor. There are high-temperature bubble pools, warm-water paddling pools for children, and deep-water swimming pools in the hot spring center. Fruit snacks, beverages, inflatable guns, and swimsuits are available. There is a bathtub in the room where the children are very happy. The double bed is a 2.7-meter big bed. It is not too comfortable for two big, two small and four people to sleep. The day before check-in, manager Huo called to ask about the needs, gave substantive suggestions and help, added a bed fence, sent children's toiletries and slippers (good quality), delayed the check-out time, etc., the service is excellent. The shower water pressure in the room is big enough, the shower is like a massage gun, and the shower is very refreshing. Flying in the oin**ent: The elevator door sense is too poor, it directly clamped the baby stroller, but fortunately the baby's hand did not reach out at that time, otherwise the consequences would be unimaginable! Another time, the foot of a big brother on the same ladder was pinched, and it is strongly recommended to repair and improve it. The other is that the sink is out of reach of children, it would be nice to provide a footstool. The breakfast buffet is average.

Check the actual situation and then call to apply for an extra bed. Give him a thumbs up for his serious work👍

msg:I stayed at Macrolink Lijing Hot Spring Hotel 4 years ago, and I felt very good at that time! This Spring Festival trip brought the whole family here and still chose this place. The rooms are spacious, bright and comfortable, and there are rich hot springs, swimming pools, scrubs, and massage items. Chinese food and buffet are all available, and the taste is good! The most important thing is that there are Mongolian ponies and alpacas that children like. This is a good place to take the elderly and children on vacation!
I would also like to thank Xiaosun at the front desk here. It was very late when I contacted the front desk after placing an order with Ctrip, but he answered all our doubts enthusiastically and coordinated actively and carefully. The day of check-in was very smooth, and the family members Very satisfied, will come here again next time.

The service of the hotel makes me feel like a surprise
I thought that the five-star service of local brands was just that
Unexpectedly, from the moment the hotel was booked, Manager Huo called to provide better suggestions, and arranged everything in advance for the people needed in the room. After that, all kinds of reminders were just right...remind me of St. Regis Personal butlers are not necessarily so thoughtful
The happiness index of the entire hotel staff is very high during the Spring Festival, and the Chinese New Year is very cordial.
In short, this trip to the hotel has refreshed my understanding of the local five-star hotel, and service is the soft power of the five-star hotel.

The water temperature of the hot spring is suitable. Many children play in the ocean ball pool, and the water temperature is stable. I think this is very rare. The breakfast is not comparable to that of a seaside hotel. Fortunately, there are a variety of food and ample supply. Those who go there at ten o'clock will have everything.
What impresses me deeply is that the hotel staff are serious and responsible, especially Manager Huo. We contacted him directly if we had any problems, and they solved them in time.

The hotel is not too far away. Children like the appearance of the castle very much. There are two alpacas outside, which can be touched closely. The children were very excited to interact with them. When we arrived at the hotel, Manager Lee enthusiastically helped us check in, and also gave us snacks, drinks and fruits. There were slides and building blocks in the room. The baby liked it very much and kept playing non-stop. The check-in experience was quite good. The hot spring is also very friendly to Xiaobao. The children's game pool is very large and the temperature is right. The children had a great time playing and couldn't bear to leave.

Before checking in, I received a phone call from the hotel's duty manager, Manager Huo, asking about the number of occupants and their needs, and added WeChat. If you have any questions, you will feel very convenient. The hotel environment is very good, and the room is clean. Next It is also super cool to soak in the outdoor hot spring on a rainy day. I need to make two small suggestions. One is that there are quite a lot of parents who bring a 1.4-meter child. The 1.4-meter breakfast and hot spring are full-price tickets. Is the 1.4-meter whole? Can you set half price? There is also a link for children to collect stamps and exchange gifts. All check-in items are charged. For example, a child of intangible cultural heritage experience is 80, and a child of a small train is 30. A total of 7 items need to be punched in. Consumers will feel that the promotion fee of the hotel is heart-warming. It’s awkward, can you refer to Chimelong’s stamp stamping mode, there is no charge for stamping, and after the stamping is successful, the child can get a special puzzle or badge that is not very valuable, in fact, the child should enjoy the process of stamp stamping, Instead of what the gift is, if you have to consume it in the process, the experience will be much lower. Overall satisfied, I hope my suggestions can be helpful to the hotel and future guests.

The hotel's hot springs should also be reserved in advance. Make an appoin**ent directly when you check in. The hot spring environment is still good.

The fly in the oin**ent is , If you can't live in a hotel, you have to buy tickets to enter the hot spring. I hope this can be improved. Hotel accommodation should be free to enter and exit. In addition to the hot spring, there are two amusement facilities that children can play, one is free, the other is charged, 100 per time, which is also quite expensive. The hotel's catering is good, there are many varieties of breakfast and dinner. The lawn outside the hotel can be used for horseback riding, feeding small animals such as alpacas, and go-karts, which are not cheap.

msg:The breakfast is quite satisfactory, not bad or bad, and the facilities can be well maintained in all aspects. It is suitable for taking children to play. Book two days to get various experience coupons, picking eggs and picking fruits VR are all children's favorites. The hot spring has various indoor and outdoor pools, and the children have a heated ocean ball pool and a swimming pool. The key is that the butler service is too intimate, it is worth taking the baby to check in.

msg:I bought the National Day package and rushed over on the 1st. There are many activities in the package, such as hot springs, picking, handicraft, and buffet breakfast and dinner. It's a good experience to come early. The room is big and clean. The caring manager Huo prepared a small bathrobe for the child in advance. After the buffet dinner, he went to the hot spring at 8 o'clock. There were not many people, and both indoors and outdoors were fun. Played until nearly 10 o'clock to go home. You can ride a pony on the large lawn at the entrance. It costs 100 yuan for 15 minutes, which is much more cost-effective than in the city. The elder sisters who picked the orchard are very enthusiastic. They have apples, pears, beans, pumpkins, and everything. They are full of wild fun. It is a friendly reminder that it is best to wear rain boots. It is easy to step on the mud. I had a great time playing this time, and Manager Huo gave intimate tips throughout the whole process, thank you very much! There will be a chance to come to the hot springs in the future.

msg:First of all, I came to this hotel for the first time. The location is in Shunyi, and the navigation is still easy to find. It's good to see it online. We ordered a parent-child room, the hotel has a variety of parent-child rooms, and we ordered a small robot. First of all, the water bar gives a lot of thoughtful things, all of which are free. Since it is a parent-child room, there are many things for children, small tents, small wooden horses, table football, and a robot that can chat and follow the children around the house. . The whole room is 80 square meters and is very large. There are two toilets, one is dedicated to children, and the children's toiletry set and small stools are carefully prepared to easily reach the sink, and the toilet also has special trea**ent. There are also building blocks, plush toys, etc. in the room that can be taken away for free. Every link of the service is also in place. Manager Yuan of the hotel is very good. He asked the needs of the guests one day in advance, and tried to meet the needs of the guests. It should be checked out at 12:00, but I was afraid that the children would take a nap, so I postponed it to 2:00 in the afternoon. , give Manager Yuan a thumbs up. The breakfast buffet was included, and the whole thing was good and everything was complete. There is a naughty castle on the first floor, which is suitable for children. It is free. There are remote control cars. Children can sit on it and visit the entire hall on the first floor. The restaurant has a cafe to eat western food, and a Chinese restaurant is also on the first floor. There is a massage and a 5D cinema on the second floor. There are karts, off-road vehicles, alpacas and small animals on the lawn at the entrance. All in all, it's good to stay for a day or two on weekends. Will continue to come next time.

msg:As a parent-child hotel in the suburbs of Beijing, it is worth experiencing. Although the sparrow is small, it has all the internal organs and basic facilities, such as restaurants, parent-child areas, hot springs, farm experiences, etc. There is also a lawn for playing rugby, the hotel is quite big, and the breakfast is also good It is rich, and the room is OK. Although the hardware is average, it is not too noisy. After all, it cannot be compared with luxury 5 stars. The overall is more user-friendly, the package content is relatively rich, the hot spring can also be entered multiple times on the same day, and it is also equipped with snacks and drinks. It is worth mentioning that the on-duty manager Huo is very attentive and considerate. Although it is not a butler-style hotel, he does give the guests the experience of a butler-style service. He will try his best to coordinate and meet the needs. The whole family is very happy, in short, the check-in experience is good, and you can check in again!

The 999 package I bought at the beginning, I contacted Mr. Song from the hotel the day before check-in to help prepare the bed surround and two children's toiletries. When checking in at the hotel, Mr. Song also helped to make up the price difference and upgraded the theme room, and also helped to order a birthday cake at the western restaurant of the hotel. Really super grateful. Children can play for a long time in the room. In the afternoon, I soaked in hot springs and played in the ocean pool. It feels like a lot of new facilities have been added since the first visit. The water temperature in the ocean ball pool is not too cold, it is warm, and it is no problem for small children (my eldest child + 1 year old) to play. After breakfast, the alpaca family was fed at the entrance of the hotel. The carrots were prepared by the hotel. Thank you for having a baby alpaca who loves to pose. The children like to hug him. Super cute. I also experienced a 5D cinema on the second floor, and I personally feel a little dizzy. The naughty castle is a little small, but the children still like to play dinner at the western restaurant on the first floor. The pizza and beef noodles are delicious, and the mango mousse cake made by the western restaurant is also very good, not too sweet, suitable for The elderly and children also gave a big bowl of longevity noodles to the little birthday star. Everyone was very happy to eat. I would like to thank the staff in the room that night. The child sprinkled water on the bed and replaced them with new ones overnight. Special thanks to Mr. Xiao Song for his careful arrangement. I have to go to you again👍 and catch all the strawberry bears again🤗

【live】
Hotel parent-child theme room. The room is equipped with double bathrooms, shower room and bathtub, dressing room, reception room, and a 2-meter large bed. It is really too spacious, comfortable and warm. Children's products are readily available - children's full set of wash travel clothes, children's mouthwash cups, children's slippers , children's bathrobes, children's toilet seats, and footstools for children to wash their hands, toy llamas that can be taken away, small slides and small swings, table football, bead toys, children's play mats, children's rocking horses, Children's tent. . . . . . On the first day of check-in, fruits, snacks and delicious white fungus and Sydney soup were also presented. During the stay, the room was tidy up every day, and bottled mineral water in the room was supplied every day. Oh, by the way, the room fee also comes with a gift box of moon cakes~~
【eat】
Breakfast is available from 7:00 to 10:00, even if it arrives at 9:30, it is still fully served. There are both Chinese and Western food, with a wide variety of varieties. Eggs are divided into boiled eggs, fried eggs, and tender scrambled eggs. Milk is also divided into cold milk and hot milk. There are no less than 6 kinds of breakfast porridge, rice noodles, wontons, noodles, Shaomai, Pancakes, glutinous rice fried. . . There are also many kinds of bread. . . I also drank yogurt made from a yogurt machine, and the yogurt ingredients also have 9 grids. Very satisfied. For lunch and dinner, I chose the Chinese restaurant and the western food on the first floor. The taste is very authentic and it is very comfortable to eat.
【spa】
The water temperature is good, the pool is one big and one small, enough for children to play. The hot spring provides small bread, small cakes, juice and fruit, as well as self-heating rice, instant noodles and other supplies. There are many types of small hot spring pools, all kinds of water temperature and materials, adults and children can play very comfortably.
【Play】
(1) The indoor children's playground in the hotel is relatively small, with climbing frames, small slides, ocean balls, and small jumping beds. There are also some currency-changing game machines, doll machines, electric cars, shooting games, etc. that require additional consumption in the hotel. I also saw a 5D, but I didn't have time to experience it.
(2) Picking fruits: Picking is included in the room ticket, and you can get there by driving and navigating. The eldest sister and uncle are very enthusiastic, with two big pockets of various fruits, haha
(3) Intangible cultural heritage handicrafts: There are only two days on weekends. We catch up with Saturdays. There are many kinds of handicrafts. The dolls can sit down and tinker with them for at least 1 or 2 hours. The playability is very strong. If you don't have time to do it, you can also use the ticket in exchange for an intangible cultural heritage product to take away, like it!
(4) Feeding the alpacas: Opposite the hotel entrance, next to the small train is a family of three alpacas. The rations for feeding the alpacas must be collected at the indoor children's playground with one ticket for one bag. Carrot sticks. In other words, this alpaca family has a good appetite.
(5) There are also Hebei Village Customs Culture Experience Park, Hanshiqiao Wetland, International Flower Port, and Memorial Hall of Jiaozhuanghu Tunnel Battle Site, which can be visited by the way.
【Serve】
Front desk check in and check out is fast. Before moving in, Manager Huo contacted him, reminded him of the epidemic prevention requirements, and assisted in solving all problems during his stay. No matter where you are in the hotel, there are staff who give friendly reminders and courteous service.

It's hard to understand why there is a single charge. I have stayed in a lot of hot spring hotels and they are all hot springs to play casually. This is the first time I have encountered such a situation. Also, the ticket price is too expensive, and there is no discount for guests staying in the hotel. It costs more than 200 tickets, which is the same as the price of staying in the hotel. It is really disappointing. If you want to soak in hot springs, you can just buy a ticket and play. The shop is too worthless.

msg:The hotel room is very large, probably because there are very few people due to the epidemic. The hot spring pool is very large, with a temperature suitable for children to soak in, and the outside air is also very good. The overall staff of the hotel are very enthusiastic. After the reservation, a special person called to communicate in advance. The service staff, Xiao Song, learned that we have children who have prepared the baby's pajamas and toiletries in advance, and let them check in early. They sent a lot of fruit and white fungus soup . In short, the overall feeling is very good, but there are relatively few restaurants nearby. The hotel's western restaurant has suspended self-service at night due to the epidemic, which is a pity. The group's hotel coupons, including hot springs, also gave 10 catties of vegetables, which was full of harvest. Will come again next time~

msg:🚗 Transportation: Check in at three o'clock. In the morning, we went to the surrounding area to play for a long time. Xiangyun Town, Koala Adventure, Arthur's Kingdom, Olympic Water Park, and Hanshiqiao Wetland Park are all nearby, and then click the navigation to arrive, very convenient and free parking.

🍃Environment: The hotel is not new, so the decoration in many places has been damaged, and the equipment is partly aging, but it does not affect the experience at all.
1⃣️ First of all, the appearance of the hotel is very a**ospheric, like a castle. The lobby, corridors and rooms are all very large. The 2m king bed is also not available in many five-stars now, which is what I especially like! There are many rooms. We went on weekdays, and it was quiet in the morning and evening. The breakfast was 7-10 o'clock. We went after 9 o'clock. The off-peak meal was also very good. The yogurt machine is the kind of self-help, not boxed, the child thinks it is quite novel~
2⃣️The swimming pool and hot spring are together, most people are in the hot spring, the swimming pool is relatively clean, the water temperature is 28 degrees, and the hot spring is 35-41 degrees. There is no isolation rope, there is a slight safety hazard here in the shallow water area... The dressing room is a little messy, many people can't find slippers and bath towels, so that our slippers were worn by people in the hall, and some people had to go Take someone else's bath towel... The hot spring provides simple bread, juice and fruit, hot drinks, not on time, and fast food such as self-heating rice and instant noodles.
The children's playground is very small, enough to pass the time, in addition to the climbing frame, other additional consumption of currency exchange, doll machines, game consoles, electric cars, shooting games, etc.

🧹Hygiene: Not bad, the bedding is comfortable and clean, the furniture may fall to the ground because of the material problem, this is not a problem of cleaning, and it is not a problem for the stay experience. The breakfast restaurant is hygienic, and it is good to clean up, add and close empty plates in time. It is the hot spring. It is recommended that you go to the next morning (10-22 o'clock), and the water quality is very general at night...

🔔Service: The overall is not bad, the check-in is very fast, the explanation is clear, the check-in time is two o'clock, the temporary text message on the day will notify three o'clock, the room is not ready at three o'clock, the lady at the front desk presented the hotel lawn to feed the alpacas. But the temperature was too low and we didn't go...
The hot springs are here to say, most hotel swimming pools are included in the room rate, but due to construction problems, you must buy hot spring tickets or book a package room to go to the swimming pool. Like us who are not interested in hot springs and just want to go swimming, just go to the pool. There's no other way, fortunately the package is more cost-effective, spending 200 extra just for swimming! I was just afraid that the money would be wasted, so I soaked for ten minutes before leaving. This is indeed something I didn't ask clearly before booking, and I really didn't expect it to be like this...
There are also picking coupons in the package, which also makes up for it. 10 pounds of vegetables are free or two boxes of strawberries are exchanged. This bonus item is very interesting for children, and it is very suitable for parents and children. Recommended!

In short, it is a good hotel, very suitable for taking children on weekends and the like. If the requirements for hotel software and hardware are not particularly high, I believe that you will have a lot of fun! We shouldn't come here on purpose, but if we come back with our partners, we'd still be willing to do so, so sauce.

msg:This is the best parent-child hotel I have ever stayed in. It really considers a lot of details for children. for example:
1. The toilet has a children's toilet seat;
2. There are anti-collision *****s at the corners of the table;
3. A small footstool is placed in the washbasin of the bathroom, which is convenient for children to brush their teeth and wash their hands;
4. Prepare the child's toiletries, bathrobes, and small slippers;
etc. Compared with the Internet celebrity parent-child hotel, Minmetals Narada is really caring.

The Ultraman decorations, toys and slides in the parent-child room make the children simply reluctant to leave the room and have a great time playing.

The hot springs are clean, and there are pools with various water temperatures and additives, so adults and children can play comfortably.

Moreover, all the staff are very warm and friendly, and they will also give children tremella and Sydney soup and small gifts. There is also a fruit plate every day. The bottled water in the room is not like two bottles in ordinary hotels, but seven or eight bottles.

It is definitely recommended for traveling with children.

msg:Just like everyone's situation, when I can't go out to Beijing, I took a vacation with my family before the Spring Festival. I chose this hotel because I liked his hot spring.
    1. The room. It's quite big. The bathroom is not only separated from wet and dry, but also independent of each partition. The single bed is 1.35 meters, so a two-child family is completely stress-free. Each room has a small balcony which unfortunately cannot be opened. A small suggestion: the night light in the bathroom is too bright.
    2. Catering. The breakfast is quite complete, especially the pancakes on the left side of the door are very good. Of course, overall it's not that impressive. There is a Chinese restaurant on the first floor, which is Sichuan cuisine. The dishes are quite authentic. The pigeons and platters in Cantonese cuisine are a bit salty.
    3. Services. The customer service manager contacted one day in advance, basically meticulous, and the prompts were in place. Epidemic prevention is also very strict, and scanning the code is also indispensable.
    4. Hot springs. It is called Xiyue Hot Spring. There are indoor and outdoor parts, not particularly large, but there is a children's area and a small fish pond, all of which are included in the ticket. The outdoor pool is very comfortable with fewer people. The swimming pool and hot spring are together, not a standard pool, but enough to play. The bathing area is relatively clean, there is a buffet, some snacks and fruits plus pigmented water, it is no problem to have a pad. The little ones can have fun.
    5. Around. There is a picking, which is easy to miss if you want to search for "Diyuan Suihang Agriculture". The tomatoes have been picked by others, and the peppers have been picked a lot. The experience of the little pot friend is very good. A few kilometers to the north, there is an international flower port. There are no flowers and no scenery in winter, but the Butterfly World is okay. It is recommended to buy a package ticket.
    In general, 1-2 nights with family is a good choice.

msg:Environmental sanitation: The hotel's hygiene can meet expectations, and the layout is relatively warm. Compared with the accommodation, the hot spring experience is relatively poor, with various puddles and various slippers.
Service: The overall feeling is that the service is very good in terms of service etiquette and service attitude, and many problems can be solved in time. Manager Huo in the lobby solved the problem of renewing the room in a timely manner, and was still very responsible. The restaurant manager should be the restaurant manager who greeted the western restaurant door, who was warm and thoughtful. However, the overall lack of service continuity in the hotel may be related to the problem of the passenger flow gap between Friday and Saturday! Obviously the service on Saturdays and Sundays can't keep up.
Facilities: How to say, the room lobby has all kinds of facilities, but the children's parent-child park is a pain point. It is not as big as the living room at home, and it is still charged. Compared with Yanqi Hotel, is there a price gap?
Summary: All parent-child hotels have highlights that can capture customers. I really haven't experienced it here, maybe I haven't discovered it yet! Recommended, but it is recommended not to expect too much!

After entering the room, a foreign object was found in the bathroom toilet, and the service manager decisively adjusted another room. The new room smelled of sewers, so I opened the windows to ventilate, so I endured it. I found that the wall around the bathtub was oil stains left by the previous guest, haha. The teacups on the tea table have tea stains! Stains on the sink! Gritting my teeth and staying for one night, I was woken up by the music in the next room at 8:00 in the morning. The residents in the next room could hear the conversation clearly! I called the lobby manager and explained: The sound insulation of the room is not good, so there is nothing I can do. I'll give you a little present when you go downstairs later. (I didn't see it until I checked out). At the front desk, the staff who answered the phone at the switchboard also had a blunt tone! All in all, not a hotel worth living in!

The hotel is located in Shunyi District. We drove there in less than an hour. Free parking is available on the ground and underground, which is very convenient. The hotel is very clean. We booked two rooms. One room was upgraded to a parent-child room and an Ultraman themed room. The children liked it very much and were very happy.

The hotel has a lot of choices for breakfast, and the quality of the food is okay, but there is nothing outstanding. I prefer coffee, which is freshly ground, which is better than the coffee in general hotels.

In particular, there are hot springs in the hotel, both indoors and outdoors, both children and the elderly can soak in, there are children's play pools, there are also different hot spring pools (wine, rose, sulfur, mint) and small fish ponds, where children can play. lol.

For the child's birthday, the hotel also arranged birthday decorations and sent birthday cakes. The hotel staff drew birthday cards by hand. The children were very excited and cherished, and they took the cards home and treasured them. Small snacks are also prepared.

Oh, by the way, before we left, we also went to the nearby Diyuan Farm to pick. There are hot springs, food and picking. It was a perfect trip!

For the sake of the children, we also only took a dip in the children's pool. After soaking for two days in a row, my skin feels moisturised 😂
Meal options are a little less. The Chinese restaurant is average but the serving size is ok. The service is ok, all very polite and attentive.

After arranging the itinerary, we arrived at the hotel on Saturday afternoon, full of Chris**as details! When we checked in, Manager Huo received us and determined the best way to enjoy the hot pot buffet and hot springs (soak first, have dinner, and then soak again) to fully relax!
The temperature in the hotel is very high, so just wear a layer of casual clothes! When I returned to the room in the evening, I didn't expect that there was a plate of fruit and safety socks (apples and candies).
It is said that the hotel also has alpacas. We asked Manager Huo to help arrange it and fed the alpacas carrots. The weather was cold and the alpaca wool was really warm😃
I didn’t have time to go to the spa this time. I’ll make an appoin**ent next time I come. I had a great time this Chris**as!

The package is also the hot spring. For the rest of the 5d, alpaca and the like are tricking people, and the small playground is also very frustrated.
The quality of the buffet dinner is too bad, there is nothing good to eat. If you really spend 298 to eat, you will definitely get into the brain

If you are tired, you can go back to your room to rest. When there are fewer people at night, you will not have to grab a rest with the person who bought the hot spring single ticket. Area.

Checking in the hotel provided fruit and white fungus snow pear soup to the fire and beverage snacks. I experienced a meal delivery service because the kitchen was under pressure during the buffet time of the western restaurant at noon on Saturday. It takes about 40 minutes, which is not too slow. The food is also good, and the pizza ingredients are fresh enough. Baby likes it. The children's playground on Friday afternoon was reserved by our family. The baby played for two hours. There is a small paradise in the western restaurant. It is recommended to put less seats because there are no books. Two small non-powered facilities can be added. The hot springs provide free drinks and fruits are good. It is recommended to provide adult and baby bathrobes in the changing room. I forgot to give the baby the bathrobe in the room. It would be convenient if there is a bathrobe in the dressing room. Because the bath towel is too big for the baby. The overall experience is very satisfactory. Will come again next time.

On the day of check-in, Manager Huo called in advance to tell us the various hotel facilities and the time of various activities. During the stay in the store, Manager Huo also reminded us that we have any needs, even if we find them, it is very considerate.
When you enter the room, you will see welcome fruits and white fungus soup, as well as bath towels, slippers, and welcome cards prepared in advance for the children. It is very warm.
This is the second time we have stayed in the hot springs. This time I feel better than last time. There are not many people in the hotel now and it is very comfortable. There are many activities suitable for children. The package we bought allows you to play Naughty Castle for free, as well as VR, feeding alpaca, and there should be picking and some children’s handicrafts. This time there is no experience because of time.
Let's talk about the hot springs, there are indoor and outdoor, very good, although it is a weekend, but there are not many people, the experience is super good, and the water quality is very clean. There are free drinks, fruits and snacks in the hot spring area. The kids have the ocean ball pool to play. We played in it for almost 3 hours. By the way, the swimming pool is also next to the hot spring, all of which are integrated, which is very good.
For eating, the hotel has a buffet and a Chinese restaurant to choose from, and it was good this time.
After the child went home, he kept saying that he still wanted to play. It is estimated that we will go there again in the near future.

Manager Huo contacted by phone in advance, provided various warm reminders, patiently answered questions, caught up with the hotel activities, took the initiative to upgrade the Lijing Family Room, a special surprise! I communicated via text messages in advance, checked in at 12 o'clock, fed the alpacas, ate lunch, and attended the little chef class on time. The children made their own biscuits and liked them very much. The hot spring is very suitable for children. The water temperature in the ocean ball pool is particularly good. I don’t want to come out after playing for a long time. There are free fruits, snacks and drinks, and the service staff is also very timely. At night, there are fewer people and it is a special show. It is very pleasant. There are also various special baths, small fish ponds, and outdoor hot springs because of the cold. It is a little regrettable, but the scenery is really good!
Dinner buffet, 198 people, no sashimi, but all kinds of iron plates are available. There is a small children's area in the restaurant, which can liberate parents for a while, which is very considerate.
The picking is right at the entrance of the hotel, there are many kinds of vegetables that can be picked, and the big sisters in the greenhouse are very good 👌
It’s a nice trip. You can come again in spring and you can experience the outdoor hot springs. The large lawn at the door will look better. I hope to raise more small animals and feed the alpacas by the way. They are too hungry...

The room is relatively large, and the bathroom is separated from wet and dry. I bought a children's toothbrush; I am not satisfied with the place that the hotel washes and protects the hair conditioner is not very good, for girls with long hair, it is not soft enough after use. I went with the children, but the children's slippers provided were too small to wear at all. Free combs, some other hotels already provide multi-row combs, which are better for girls, and straight-row combs are not very easy to use. The TV is a bit small, and the signal is not too loud, because it is just in time to watch the Olympic Games on mode. Relatively speaking, the breakfast is not very rich. Compared with the price, it needs to be strengthened. The dinner buffet was overpriced and not worth it. The hot spring hotel I have stayed in before includes the hot spring fee. This hotel does not include it, which is somewhat unexpected. During the Spring Festival, there are more people, and the number of people will be limited. If you want to buy food and drink in the hot spring, you have to use the mobile phone to check out on the spot, which is a bit troublesome, so it would be better to write it directly on the box number. I bought a cup of coconut milk. It was too sweet. I only took a sip. It was too unpleasant to drink. This should also be improved. I had to eat and drink the food myself before selling it. The big lawn outside the hotel door is good for taking pictures.
Overall ok, details could be improved, but would not recommend friends or come again.

The decoration of the room is very warm, and many children like toys. Come to the hot spring in winter😁

Warm, there are unicorn plush toys on the bed, as well as pillows. In addition, several kinds of snacks and children’s toiletries, bathrobes and pink slippers are arranged.

After check-in, he specially came to give the children snacks and movie tickets. He also helped to book a seat for dinner, which was very considerate! Like him 👍 The hotel environment has nothing to say, the service is very good, because my father did not get off work, I took the boy to the hot spring by myself, and my uncle has been helping to pick up the children from the male guest. It is very caring! The child is so happy that he will come again in two days! The children’s playroom is not big, but it is suitable for small children. The layout of the room is especially for children. The game facilities (more suitable for little babies, we are too big), children’s bathing suits, bathrobes, children’s slippers, snacks, etc., in short, are very intimate and very satisfied!

The hotel’s parent-child service is very good. Our child is one and a half years old. The manager Huo at the front desk communicated with us in advance the theme room type that the baby likes, precautions for hot springs, etc. The service is very thoughtful and caring, and also helped us change 2 The room type of the bed. The restaurant and guest room services are also very enthusiastic and professional. The restaurant has children's tableware and toys.

msg:Temporarily decided to take the children out for the weekend, not to go out of Beijing, to be able to soak in hot springs, and there are places for children to play in the hotel. Based on these requirements, I chose Xinhualian Lijing Hotel. I have only come to eat buffet and hot springs before, and the impression is not bad, this time I will experience the accommodation again.
Due to the late arrival time, I changed my clothes and soaked in the hot spring at 9 o’clock. The hot spring front desk suggested that the next day should be more abundant. However, because I had an appoin**ent with friends the next day, it is not suitable for children to soak for too long, so I chose Buy a ticket and go in (ticket 168, weekend 218, the same price as in the review, you can pay when you arrive, I heard us discuss changing clothes in the room, and actively asked if the guest is staying in the hotel, and told the guest that the preferential price is 128, so happy 😃). Since it was late and there were not many people inside, the children had a great time playing ocean ball in the big pool with lower temperature, and also tried the small pool with special characteristics. Before I left, I went to the beverage area. Although it was approaching the clearing time, the service staff watched us come and asked what to drink. They picked up some smoothies for the children and asked if they could have some snacks. And I opened the hot drink again and asked if I wanted something hot, and the attitude was very good.
The room is also very spacious, the bed is a double bed of 1.35, moderately soft and hard, writing desk, small sofa, coffee table, luggage rack are all complete, the bathroom is also wet and dry partition, there is a bathtub and shower (shower head can be removed and hand held, very suitable Children), the hardware facilities are complete. Room service asked for children’s bathrobes and slippers. The waiter brought two bathrobes and two pairs of slippers of different sizes for the children to choose from, which was very considerate.
The breakfast on the second day was quite satisfactory. There was no special surprise, but it was basically complete, and everything you wanted was satisfied. It was equipped with children’s plates and chopsticks.
On the first floor, there are intangible cultural heritage handicrafts, a claw machine, a car to drive (charged items), and a free playroom, which is more suitable for smaller and younger children.

msg:Nice experience.
In terms of service: Sun Tao, the on-duty manager, took the initiative to contact him one day in advance, asked about the needs and the time of arrival, and helped arrange the room in advance. Because it is inconvenient to bring the children, I will arrange check-in directly when I arrive at the hotel around 10 o'clock. You don’t have to wait until the afternoon. The child’s family is still very important. During the two-day stay, the manager on duty was very attentive. He delivered fruits, prepared bathrobes for the children, and gave gifts before leaving.
Environmental facilities: We went on a weekend. It took 1 hour from the city to arrive. I don’t feel that there are too many people (the hot spring is more crowded but acceptable), underground parking is free, the hot spring water is relatively clean, the hotel’s overall air-conditioning and network environment They are all comfortable. The food and water in the hot spring area are relatively ordinary. The only food is Sachima and Dali Garden buns. The water is basically a blended drink. We only drank lemonade and brought some food for the children. There are many hot spring pools, such as lemon bath, red wine bath, rose bath, mint bath, etc. There are also no outdoor experiences. Children who kiss the fish pond are more interested. In addition, there are 2 playgrounds for children, which are about 38 degrees. The child is hot, about 35 degrees, which is more suitable. You can also swim in a separate area, about 1 meter 2 and the maximum depth is 1 meter 6. You must wear a swimming cap.
The hotel itself has a small children's activity area, which is not too big. It is relatively new for children under 6 years old, and there are many other activities. What we bought is a package, including: intangible cultural heritage experience, alpaca feeding, 5D movies, picking The children are more interested in the intangible cultural heritage experience. The teacher has been encouraging her during the painting for one and a half hours; there are 3 alpacas, the youngest are very popular with most children, and the other two are older and younger. I will be more scared; the 5D movie experience is not so good: it starts at 10 in the morning, but there is no staff at 10 o’clock. Many children gathered at the door, and the staff came after a long phone call. The picking was outside the hotel. About 2 kilometers, there is no compulsory consumption. Finally, I would like to praise that the breakfast is really good, there are many kinds, each table is accompanied by toys, the children like it, the overall experience is good, and will come again.

Solved, the service is really excellent 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻, the service of the Nangong Hot Spring Resort Hotel that took the children to before was terribly poor, so a good hotel depends on the level of the management, and it is recommended to go to parents and children~~~ Moms share, will come again in September

The twin standard room booked can be put together into a big bed, and it is just right to live with a baby. The room is relatively large, clean and has no odor. Xiao Zhao at the front desk has a very good service attitude. He contacted in advance to find out that he was living with children, and he prepared children's bathrobes and small dolls. The children liked it very much. After soaking in the hot springs, I went there on Friday afternoon. There were not many people. There were many pools. There was a large paddling pool suitable for children with suitable water temperature. There was also a small fish pond with fruit drinks. The hotel’s indoor children’s room is a bit small, but it’s good for kids to play. I participated in the little chef experience activity on Saturday and made biscuits. The kids were very happy.

msg:之前來過一次，這次是第二次來。霍經理提前瞭解我們的需要，推薦了合適的項目和套餐，非常貼心🌹
房間寬敞，設備完好，住的舒服，需要添點什麼也都很快很及時。
家庭出遊的居多。温泉種類也很多，孩子玩得也很開心。自助早餐、晚餐品種很多，服務員態度都很親近。晚餐當天是江浙風味，各種魚蝦蟹，還有生魚片，品質不錯，現炸的臭豆腐也不錯。很多蛋糕麪包冰淇淋。

msg:帶小朋友住，假期別的地方怕人太多，在攜程上按親子酒店排名找的這家温泉酒店。
既然叫先説温泉酒店，就先説温泉，特殊池子的温度基本都是38到42之間（比如紅酒池，枸杞池等）泡個十分鐘出來喝點水，大池子34、5°適合小朋友一直在裏玩。並且温泉這邊有免費的水果飲料和小點心。除了室內還有室外的七八個泡池，不太大，但是各有特色。這家就算專門來玩温泉也值。
再説娛樂，住店客人有免費的小童樂園，室外有卡丁車，不是固定賽道比速度那種，是大輪胎越野那種，男孩子應該都比較感興趣，小朋友可以自己開着去小樹林探險，還有小馬可以騎，還有網紅的羊駝可以喂。收費的娛樂同樣豐富，5D電影，水彈打靶，還有個VR體驗館。
房間很大，有浴缸，小朋友的洗漱用品很好，床品很舒服。
最後説員工，整體感覺員工都很好，和善是肯定的，主要每個員工都能為客人着想。讓我印象深刻的一位姓霍的經理，訂房的時候給酒店打電話諮詢，想要一間大床，因為我一人帶孩子，怕孩子一人睡翻身掉下床，可是當時已經沒有大床房了，我也衹好就定了標間，但是等我到房間的時候，很驚喜，是一個超大的大床，原來是霍經理知道了我想訂大床的意圖，提前在我入住前把兩張床拼在了一起。雖然這對於霍經理可能是一個小事兒，但是解決了我的大問題，這正體現了酒店對於客人的重視，這種細節很讓人感動。

設施陳舊，而且好像都沒有排風系統，路過一層的衞生間，那個煙味兒，簡直了，自行腦補吧！一眼看過去像是進入了仙境

入住第一天晚餐去了中餐廳，被告知接了一個大單，上菜要四十分鐘以後，然後轉去了西餐廳，西餐廳基本以自助為主，晚餐二百多一位，午餐一百多一位，説心裡話，還沒有外面幾十塊一位的自助餐的東西好呢，第二天中午我發現是把前一天晚餐的菜加熱了一下又拿出來了，口感跟前一天都不一樣，軟軟的都發苦了，絕對不是新做的，因為住了兩晚，都是在這個地方吃的飯，所以真的發現了很多問題，菜品不新鮮，而且巨難吃，服務員也是忙忙叨叨，他們打碎了餐具，收拾的時候那個椅子拖地的聲音，巨響，來回來去的拖，餐廳裏那麼多客人，您把椅子稍微抬起來一點挪個地方不行嗎？過了不到十分鐘，又説漏水，用機器擦地，那動靜，不知道的還以為拖拉機來了呢，一頓飯吃下來驚心動魄的！還有一個服務員，前面桌的客人問她事情，她滿頭油都打柳兒了，一直在餐桌前，邊説話邊低頭縷頭髮，能想象嗎？我看着那桌的菜都開始犯惡心了！

再説房間，窗户好像好幾年沒擦過了，而且還漏風，這些都無所謂，有窗簾擋風也是可以的，那個窗簾感覺也好久沒洗了，房間裏沙發千萬不要坐！！我和孩子坐在沙發上，過一會兒我倆都癢癢了，感覺有好多小蟲子在腿上爬，我們還都穿着長褲子，也就是説沙發根本從來沒有清潔過，巨臟！

再説温泉，儲物櫃裏的拖鞋千萬不要穿！！！我穿完了，走的時候以為會像浴巾一樣收走清洗，結果人家直接把我穿過的拖鞋又放回了儲物櫃裏，等着下一位顧客用，這要是萬一有腳氣怎麼辦？還有浴室，密密麻麻的飛蟲，而且到處都巨臟，恐怖片裏的廢棄建築，差不多就是那個樣子，放衣服的架子，我都不知道該怎麼形容了，咱們是五星級酒店，怎麼能做成這樣呢？

總體來説，除了服務比較好，其他的真的不行，不推薦

酒店配套的活動有羊駝、山羊和小鴨子，孩子很喜歡。退房後可以去附近的農場撿雞蛋，還可以去大棚採摘10斤蔬菜。

設施：整體不錯，挺新的。停車比較方便，地上地下都可以停。
衞生：整體挺乾淨。
環境：很幽靜，尤其是早晨，眼前的草坪，讓人心曠神怡。
服務：去之前收到酒店霍經理打過來的電話，告知五一入住事項，還給了一些參考建議，同時+了微信，方便聯繫。在整個住宿期間，也是時常有温馨提示，對於提出的問題也是有問必答。入住當天晚上發現忘記帶孩子的牙刷了，抱着試一試的想法給霍經理髮了微信，很快就給安排送過來了小童牙刷。很是感謝！
在湯泉，工作人員服務也很貼心，對於那些小寶貝都是照顧有佳，很温馨。工作人員都是面帶笑容，感覺挺和藹的。

早餐:由於小朋友超過1.2米，所以再單付了88元早餐，我説套餐裏不是有一小嗎，補差價是否可以？回覆是不行，説一小是贈送的。温泉也是。
【温泉】兩大一小温泉門票:由於身高原因，算成人了，另付費。
總體來説，體驗還是不錯的。美中不足的就是房間裏的洗澡水水温有點偏低，今天退房時也跟前台小姐姐説了，要是和湯泉那的淋浴温度一樣就好了😁。隔音效果一般。

週末去的，人還真不算多，温泉每個池子裏也就3-4個人，自助水果零食雖然不是很豐富，但供應及時，隨時都會補貨，也不用排隊等，比較舒心。房間呢，實話説，有些衞生細節還可以提升下，譬如電話上的灰塵，沙發扶手等，但整體服務相當炸裂，入住前一天大堂霍經理就主動聯繫，詢問幾點能到酒店，房間有什麼要求👍👍辦理入住時看到正好是家人生日，還特意讓餐廳給準備了蛋糕🎂，泡温泉時就發微信告知已經把蛋糕🎂放到房間，特別贊👍第二天還主動給辦理了延時退房，説讓孩子好好玩。酒店房間整體性價比還闊以，主要有個靠譜的霍經理👏👏👏

房間還可以，寬敞夠大，但是打掃衞生不徹底，在沙發的縫隙裏找到了一衹不屬於我們的黑襪子，希望下次能細心一點。

msg:據説酒店温泉采自地下574米，出水温度53℃，富含人體所需的礦物質和微量元素，温滑清澈，確實讓人“解衣浴罷仍留連”。特別推薦戲水區三個高壓槍似地水幕布，瀑布一樣直瀉而下，砸在身上就像接受了一場酣暢淋漓的洗禮。

户外温泉區包含多種泡池，清流潺潺，綠樹滴翠，一步一景。客房還有服務人員贈送的水果，以及為小童準備的一次非遺體驗和餵羊駝、火雞等豐富的互動活動，難得的休閑時光，支撐着自己對於未來的憧憬。特別感謝前台小劉貼心的服務，週末人多事雜，還特別為下單失誤的我更新修改訂單，協調客房。這裏絕對值得多次打卡。

缺點：餐飲太差，3星都過多了，嘗試了國慶晚宴和早餐，晚宴有海鮮，但都是白灼且以花蛤為主，蝦都是很少，慢了就沒有的那種，關鍵是基本沒有現做的，最常見的燒烤類都沒有，熱菜衹有一兩個葷菜，味道就別期待了，全程下來包括早餐衹有涼拌蘿蔔絲兒還不錯，早餐就更沒什麼了，連最常見的麪檔就真衹有麪條，連配菜都沒有的，幾乎啥都沒有
除了餐飲，孩子玩的基本都要單獨收費

msg:非常適合短途短期親子游：
攜程預訂，帶倆娃在開學前遊一圈，開車過去非常方便，可停車在門口或地下停車場，我們三天兩晚沒有遇到特別擁擠的。
酒店大堂辦理入住非常迅速，因為攜程上寫着下午入住，我以為放下行李得去轉一圈回來才能入住。結果大堂經理Eric Sun很快就幫我們辦理完入住手續，並且告知可以上樓了。特別感謝，而且全程耐心細緻講解，還為我們規劃了帶娃是先去泡温泉，走的時候再去採摘園。
之前看了攻略，説酒店可以提供小童浴袍，跟孫經理溝通後很快送到房間了，還提供了孩子拖鞋。在酒店的幾天孩子經常穿着可愛的浴袍和小粉拖鞋到處溜達。
温泉上午人少，而且水質清澈。孩子撒花玩耍足夠了，累了熱了就去旁邊吃點果汁和點心。湯泉內工作人員服務態度也是可以的。
小童樂園比較小，但是基本內容也都有了，一兩小時放電是可以的。
我們衹在酒店內吃了早餐，午餐晚餐都可以在附近餐館解決，開車幾分鐘。早餐中規中矩。
因為沒有訂到大床房，我們都是標間。床稍微有點高，老二有點爬不上去。被子有點厚重了，壓的慌，而且稍微一動就發出響聲。
房間套票裏有餵羊駝和採摘的活動，都還可以吧，增加小朋友經歷。

總之是個短途旅遊休閑的好去處。

城堡一樣的酒店外觀，房間也比市區酒店大不少，整體很乾凈。
週日打卡温泉，沒想到人還是很多的，地上也確實滑，導致我進去3分鐘都沒到，就直接摔在了石橋上，工作人員的腳底下。嚇壞了工作人員，一直問我有事嗎？但也衹是一直重複這一句話，連起來都是我自己掙扎着起來的，小夥子估計也是忙忘了，我都摔成這樣了，也不見尋找任何主管。總之我就是自己緩了半天，爬起來，自己離開…..以至於那一天都沒再走近石橋一步。
除此以外還算滿意，酒店自助早餐也不錯，酒店這邊的服務人員也不錯，就是餐廳單點的飯菜不那麼合我們的胃口，又遇到天氣不好，叫外賣也是廢了好大的勁。
總體還算滿意吧，除了我自己，孩子至少玩的很開心。
服務的三分給温泉

msg:雖然是鉑金會員，但很少寫點評，2月13日的遭遇真是人生幾十年從未遇到，非常氣憤，為了避免大家後續入坑，寫出來評價一下，如果有當日同行遇到過我們的人也可以點評説兩句，看看我説的是不是真的：
背景：我們一家三口和朋友一家三口到酒店度假，恰巧趕上下大雪，雖然路不好走，也是另一番情趣，歷經2個小時才開車到酒店；
事件經過：下午大約6點左右到酒店的温泉池泡温泉，7點左右到泳池旁的小小童戲水池玩兒，大約10分鐘後朋友的孩子説腳不舒服，從水裡舉起來一看流血了，趕快上來找工作人員處理，工作人員在忙於給別的孩子充氣（收費的大獨角獸泳圈），沒有人理我們，連給送個紙巾按壓止血的人都沒有，我們坐在一個木頭架子上抱着孩子，多次催促、吶喊十多分鐘後來了一個主管做應急處理，主管來了後工作人員馬上給主管搬了椅子讓他趕緊坐下給我們處理，終於可以帶着孩子去醫院了；
傷勢：經醫生檢查，沒有傷筋動骨，但傷口較大，縫了5針，後續每三天換一次葯，2周後視情況看是否拆線。
事件處理：
2月14日10:30先來了一個主管，問了一下情況，説回去問問領導意見再來處理；11:30左右來了一個經理，交流了很多後説房費是攜程的，他們沒收到錢，所以不一定能免房費，而且我們房子也住了、温泉也泡了、早餐也吃了，也沒有免房費的道理，但他可以去申請試試，後續換葯和拆線費用他們可以報銷，而且我們也有沒有監護好的責任（可我們是正常玩耍、沒有任何意外摔倒之類的事情發生）。我們不同意，結論説那你們報警處理吧，警察怎麼説我們就怎麼做，然後就要走了，我最後追了一句這是最後結論麼，如果這是我們也好決策，這位經理説他個人可以出200元，讓我們考慮，他去申請免房費了；12點左右打電話説可以免房費，他個人付款200元，我的朋友説個人的我們不要，我們也衹是希望獲得看病的交通費、誤工費和營養費，500元，但他們最終也沒有同意，讓我們報警，最後朋友覺的太耽誤時間就沒有報警，按他説的條件免1間房費800元和200元補償，以及負責後續醫療費用報銷結束，趕緊退放走了，多一分鐘都不想在那呆著，心理陰影呀
大家也能看到，這個酒店的應急處理是什麼樣的，意外傷害第一時間無人問津，衹關心自己的收費項目和領導是否舒適；事後説我們沒有盡到監護責任，可我們衹是正常玩耍又沒有摔倒，我們再監護就是別去唄；賠償也是很奇葩，我們是來度假的，衹玩了1個多小時就出事兒了，傷勢嚴重+心理創傷後説我們住也住了吃也吃了所以不能免房費，度假酒店沒有度假還出了這麼大的事兒住店還有什麼意義，況且如果真正按照交通費、誤工費和營養費我們也可以不用免酒店的住宿費，開始我們就説了，3天換一次葯加上最快2周拆線，至少要跑5次醫院，孩子走不了路，北京的來回打車費是多少？另外大人請幾天假以北京的平均工資是什麼水平，適當的營養費，一共1300元多麼（扣除房費衹是賠償500元）？仗着我們是住店客人不想耽誤時間就這麼欺負人非要給1000，弄的我們跟要飯的似的有必要麼，2家人搭了多半天時間討論，結果就是這樣，我們幾個大人的時間可真不值錢呀。
我所説的都是事實，沒必要拿孩子説事兒，而且酒店應該都有錄像，我也有錄音和簽字文件，寫出來供想去的朋友一個參考，個人建議如果還沒去過最好慎重，畢竟那個池子裏有很多那樣的防滑墊一旦破損很容易劃腳，誰也不想出門找晦氣，另外萬一出了事兒沒有人第一時間出來應急處理可能會導致傷口更嚴重，再有就是賠償的時候明顯感覺到店大欺客，誰想找那個不痛快呀？
有圖有真相。

msg:説實話很久沒點評，尤其是很少訂國內酒店。但既然要點就簡單説説。總體尚可，細節不足，人多就亂，管理稚嫩，但縱觀京城千元以下温泉酒店這家也算對得起這個價格因此算是中肯的點評。重要説不足，人多的時候温泉湯池衞生管理較差，不管室內還是户外湯池都有食物污染，尤其小童戲水池。基本沒人管但也確實管不住素質較低的客人。温泉內的食物檔次較低，不符合五星標準。最便宜的幾塊點心加一堆粉末泡水飲料，水果品質也一般，稍貴的西瓜按片供應，工作人員都是老大媽沒啥好臉色。温泉酒店要另外買票收費也是國內特色。既然就是奔着温泉來的應該是要讓住客優先使用，結果周邊居民也有不少。導致人滿為患，衞生堪憂。前台服務還是要肯定，及時幫忙解決了很多問題，但是速度效率較低，因為要填一堆承諾書，各種行程碼健康碼拍照，其實這個環節可以單獨設櫃枱，這樣入住手續就快多了，一家人來一個個填表拍照截圖，有的客人不在前台還要叫過來等半天，一家人要辦十幾二十分鐘，體驗就不好。其他方面就是小童娛樂項目偏少，收費項目定價太高，一個臉譜也就是一個硬殼紙八十元。早飯還不錯，晚餐自助較貴，單點菜品沒有58元以下的，一百多一個菜。總體的管理還是有待提高。個人意見不一而足。

中餐廳的飯菜味道很不錯，單價稍高一點點，因為菜量比較大，性價比是合適的。
室內外的温泉池水温適中，非常適合孩子戲水；由於限流進入，所以人不是特別的多。

購買的套餐，吐槽一下采摘水果那家，果園位置不好找，一個老大娘，應該是老闆娘，領着我們讓摘這個摘那個，不能自己隨便摘，亂七八糟的蘋果，梨子，桃都有，還都套着袋，不讓隨便摘，摘的有些有黑色坑，説是冰雹砸的，不要還不高興，説要是這樣摘就沒法幹了。最後也沒拿夠10斤，是我自己不願拿了，懶的廢話了。拿回來一個冰雹砸的，第二天就都壞了。梨都是青的，桃子都是硬的白色的。感受實在是不咋樣。

周邊沒什麼玩的，采草莓，就沒了。
房間結構就是老式標間
吃飯的餐廳不多 中餐和西餐比較一般（不如樂多港）。很多當季食材過節原因吧沒有了。

温泉室內13個室外8個，中規中矩吧，很多池子水不熱無法下去。很多沖浪設施陳舊無法開啟（不如樂多港）

感覺和樂多港價位差的不多， 老公不喜歡樂多港，決定來這邊嘗試個新的，然而這裏房間佈局差很多。温泉和吃的都不如。

因為帶着寶寶和長者，前台工作人員小劉特意為我們升級了親子家庭房間，房間面積很大，而且有很多寶寶玩具，還為我們送了羊駝玩偶和很多零食。家裡長者過生日還安排送了一個小蛋糕，非常感謝小劉！入住期間店內遇到的每個工作人員態度都非常好，大堂門口負責安排車輛的大叔人也很好，看我們帶了小孩子，因為天氣冷特意讓我們停在了門口附近的車位，非常感謝！全家都對這個酒店的服務非常滿意，説明平時酒店的培訓很到位！

房間設施很新，尤其寶寶的玩具都很乾凈，而且寶寶用品很齊全，大到滑梯玩具，小到嬰兒馬桶嬰兒浴袍拖鞋，洗漱用品，一應俱全。非常細心！
另外作為温泉酒店，温泉也很值得推薦，有事內室外的，翅子都很多，而且有適合小寶寶泡的海洋球池子，室內的話不用出酒店就能享受到，非常便利！

周邊可玩的不多，但是買套票的話可以去採摘，還是很有趣的！

🚗 交通：跟着導航走，特別好找
🧹衞生： 不管是温泉還是客房都乾淨整潔
🔔服務： 服務真的沒得説！辦理入住的時候，接待人員特意幫着安排了向陽的屋子，一進屋子，陽光灑進來，特別温暖～
                  這裏特別要感謝霍經理，我媽媽是殘疾人，腿腳不方便需要坐輪椅，也不能泡温泉。我跟我爸去泡温泉的時候，不敢讓媽媽一人在屋裡沒人守護。所以就拜託霍經理能不能安排媽媽跟我們一起進入温泉。霍經理人真的特別好，幫我們跟温泉工作人員溝通，還幫我們準備了方便輪椅進出的坡道。非常感謝霍經理的幫忙，我們一家三口很開心的度過了兩天～
🍃環境：温泉是酒店主打，池子種類很多，也沒有很多人～提供飲品水果小點心，水果也有四種，非常不錯～
三頓飯都是在中餐廳吃的，味道不錯菜量大，三個人兩道菜就夠了～買的套票酒店贈送了10斤採摘蔬菜，我去過最好的蔬菜採摘大棚，菜種類特別多，黃瓜西紅柿菠菜芹菜韭菜茴香香菜，好多好多，超過10斤的話一斤10元，也是不貴哈～
總之是很滿意的一次温泉之旅，有時間還回去的～

酒店裡兩個餐廳一中一西，味道不錯中等。
酒店裡有個小童樂園，海洋球很多，大滑梯，蹦蹦床，還有個海洋球鼓風機哈哈哈。
有幾輛小車，我住了兩天娃開了兩次。
彈球機，玩了4次，每次叔叔阿姨都給滿滿一盒。
温泉也在酒店裡，我都是在房間換完泳衣穿浴袍下去，方便。温泉挺大的，温度也不錯，有兩個戲水的池子，其中一個看起來是小童的，但沒有小童戲水的設施，也可能是那幾個雕塑似的沒開。
霍經理在第一天打電話問了我們出行的情況，給升級了房間，知道有個小男孩之後還給了個恐龍房。孩子很喜歡恐龍房，一直説太棒了太棒了。
三天兩夜，除了餵羊駝和溜了一圈小車，就沒出酒店。孩子開心家長輕鬆。
還有就是小童洗漱套裝也挺好的，小香皂用完了之後還有個專用的袋子收起來。哈哈哈哈，小熊帶走了！

1. 酒店本身的硬件設施非常好，很大氣，房間給升級到了親子房，佈置非常温馨，孩子很喜歡。
2. 服務特別好，辦理入住的時候值班經理會主動加微信，全程會主動詢問，並且衹要有需要，就會提供非常周到的服務。在這裏也特別想給值班經理孫濤五星好評。
3. 孩子玩兒得非常多，兩天絕對安排滿：温泉、做點心、淘氣堡、開吉普車、餵羊駝等等。
稍微不足的是中餐廳的菜品種比較少且味道非常一般。
不過整個酒店服務都很好，住下來心情非常愉悦。

msg:很不錯的體驗！週日入住 週一退房。週日到了以後先辦了入住 然後去温泉排隊領號，領完號才能去泡！切記不要在房間浪費時間，要分頭行動哇！拖家帶口的肺腑之言。
温泉這是比較良心的，水果麪包熱飲不限量供應，同時還有一些美味的炸串付費即可。要是體力好的孩子在這能玩一整天！
體驗了一下按摩，一般。不敢恭維。
酒店門口的羊駝可愛極了，餵了胡蘿蔔🥕
特別表演一下趙鳳經理，從打電話諮詢酒店就是她接的，到後來加微信，在入住過程中全程陪伴。遇到問題及時解決，特別暖心。

msg:酒店的硬件設施還可以，但是他絕不是一個值得去泡温泉+情侶出遊的酒店。
原因一：酒店的娛樂設施幾乎全部都是孩子的，小童樂園、羊駝、可以租的小汽車、還有各種非遺體驗，但是成人可以玩的設施衹有棋牌室（具體怎麼樣不清楚，在地下一層，去的時候沒有人，所以沒進去）+一個乒乓球案子，還有按摩。
原因二：標榜的温泉酒店，但是温泉設施比較差，室內以一個海洋球娛樂池為主，各種泡池應該衹有10個左右，室外也不是很多，泡温泉的區域與西山、金隅鳳山、維景相比都小很多。而且週末人滿為患，因為沒有更衣室櫃子所以限流等叫號，女士衹能把東西放到同行的男士更衣室。
更奇葩的是温泉衹能一次出入，如果出去吃飯的話會給你一個手環，然後3個小時內要回來，走的時候還必須把東西都帶走，自助餐廳不允許穿浴袍進入，所以你如果要去吃飯就要先洗澡換衣服拿着衣服去吃飯，然後再回來，沒有汗蒸服提供。第二天進入的話需要重新買票，住宿客人128一位。
原因三：因為大多數是標間或者帶孩子的人住宿，大床房打掃很慢，下午3點半入住時房間還沒有打掃出來。
綜上，如果是花公款開會的酒店，不在乎花錢，這可以選擇，因為畢竟單點的中餐廳價格大概是外面的三倍左右，如果是帶孩子出遊，我覺得可選的酒店還有很多，如果是情侶出遊，不推薦！

停車方便。

加床要加錢。具體看規定。

中餐廳味道一般，廣東菜，不太地道（我在廣東呆過幾年）。自助餐價格較貴，不值。周圍農家菜也算方便，價格實惠，就是太閑。

贈送採摘很贊！長者孩子很喜歡。旁邊還有個草莓採摘，味道很好，45一斤，淡季價格。

路太窄，對行人不友好，牽着孩子去採摘，車輛呼嘯而過，心驚肉跳。

温泉還行，和攜程圖片一致。有小魚咬腳，長者孩子很喜歡。但每天衹能一次略顯摳門，雖然大多數人也泡不了多次。

親子設施還算豐富，電動車，自行車，遊戲室，海洋池等，但都收費。

msg:優點：乾淨，温暖，温泉和游泳館內部可以走過去不用出酒店。有小童用品。房間非常大。有羊駝。周圍有草莓採摘。有非遺diy，小小童樂園。送了水果，喝的水管夠（我家費水）
缺點：小童用品要才知道送過來，建議預訂時或者辦理入住時看到孩子主動提供。ktv三個小時1080的價位是真瘋。如果不去温泉衹去游泳也得買温泉票有點體驗不好。娃娃機故意弄得很滑真沒必要，如果好抓大家反而花錢更多。

房間# 週末人很多 臨時預訂大床房已經沒有了～房間很大 設施齊全 浴室乾濕分離～就是太熱啦 一直開着窗户不用蓋被子～浴室打掃不太徹底 浴缸和淋浴間都有一些痕跡沒清理乾淨

早餐# 種類倒是很齊全 品質一般 與1k的房價不太符 而且週日一早人太多了 亂哄哄的影響用餐體驗

温泉# 酒店温泉住店客人128 還是挺值的的～各種温度的池子 小魚池 小童池 汗蒸房等 二樓有石板炕 泡完躺一躺很舒服～

其他設施# 酒店還有簡單的小童樂園 棋牌室健身房等 户外有兩衹羊駝可以喂一喂 總之玩兒的是夠了～

服務# 大部分工作人員很熱情 主動問好 態度親和～前台lee經理還送了孩子胡蘿蔔券 也主動幫忙解決問題 贊一個～

總之～白天在尺木無山玩兒一天 晚上來泡個温泉放鬆一下正好！

温泉不錯了，但給酒店幾個努力的方向，一是温泉的出入衹能三小時之內這個不太好，應該入住期間不限時進入，我們下午進入了一次，晚上再去還得再買票，這個體驗不好。二是酒店的自助餐確實還達不到五星酒店的水平，聖誕晚餐的品類品質還有待提高。

msg:整體環境很好，雖然因為自己身體原因沒能享受到温泉有點可惜，但是至少玩的還算開心，食物一般…不管是中餐廳的，房間叫餐還是第二天早上的早飯，都一般。
不過一條龍服務拉滿，可以在酒店本身玩一整天，羊駝很可愛。

唯一有一點點的不愉快：
大堂不知道什麼職業的一個小哥，在我辦理入住後晚上下大堂準備遛彎消食抓娃娃的時候，酒店可能當天是有明星入住，以為我是他的粉絲，“威脅”我們如果靠近他們會報警，且直接爆出了我的房間號，我感覺住在這裏絲毫沒有安全

還説我們不是第一次來，但是我們確實是第一次來啊！！

早餐種類豐富，味道也可圈可點。
温泉和泳池在一起，週五晚人不多，湯池温度準確，老少皆宜。
總體是一次很滿意的出行體驗
