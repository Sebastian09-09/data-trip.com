msg:We stayed here in 2020 and continued to be impresssed by the front desk staff who upgraded us and helped us when no one else seemed able to respond to simple requests. The cleaning staff were equally friendly. We were disappointed with many other changes. Most of the pools were closed with accesses closed off so that pool-goers could only enter at one spot. Pool attendants outfitted with whistles,used regularly, ruined what used to be a nice pool area. Many tiles are lifting in the entrance of the pool. It is in need of upgrading. The choices at the evening buffet have been reduced substantially. We went to the bar to eat there instead and were to told that food is no longer served at the bar. We also went to the Executive Suite which was a dark room with stale nuts and peanut butter and banana sandwiches. While many choices are available at the breakfast buffet, the quality has gone down considerably. Forks and knives are at a minimum. The place is in desperate need of upgrading. The location at the end of Sanya Bay seemed quiet and idyllic before now seemed isolating with the lack of choices. It is not a resort.

msg:Let's start with the highlights:
1. Check in and check out smootly
2. Room spacious and clean
3. Breakfast is good and even with full hotel, table available (thumbs up for the management)
4. Pool area very nice, plenty of chairs to use 
5. Restaurants and room service are good, pity that for dinner, available choice of BBQ area was very limited (hot pot although is a very traditional thing for Chinese, could also have a kind of Liaoning style BBQ which is totally beach highlight in any part of the world)
6. Coffee shop/bar very good
7. Cleanness of the room spot on, well done (my negative points will not come from the job made by housekeeping but for the orders they have from management)
Not pleasant points:
1. No replacement of coffee/milk powder on room (it's a very cheap thing, even 2 Star hotels do that, shame on IHG)
2. No changing sheets, which i can understand in a 2/3 Star hotels but not on ones you spend more than ¥ 1.300.00/night again in my view shame on IHG with the lame excuse of environment.
3. Disposable slippers not replaced in my 4 days stay (again, even a 2/3 star hotels do that without asking for, saving little bucks is kind of lame) 
4. Overall the place is kind of old, although not yet rundown, the hotel could do some kind of enhancement of exterior appearance special from swimming pool view, could be painted or washed, repair the parts broken, eliminate the metal green box on roof (of course i didn't take picture, it's an eyesore), in summary, a little effort for appearance and keep fresh and kind of exclusive (which you expect from a hotel that call themselves a resort)
Do i come back?
Sanya for sure, this hotel, probably not, although the staff are great, i just don't like to be in a place that i have to ask things when i paid for the service already. I'm a ihg member but i didn't book through their app, but in trip (as i found better price than their own app, just UNBELIVABLE) :)

msg:Seaside but quite far from town. The place looks grande but not well kept. Everything looks like a wet carpet (literally and figuratively). My nephew’s family found a dead bird in the pool while swimming. The staff needed to be told by their manager to help me drag the luggage cart up to my room. And when checking out, the guy just watched me drag and load my luggages to the cart. It’s great that they have a free basketball court, but one of the lifeguards that played with her was being creepy and tried to hit on her. Room and view was not bad but a lot of other hotels at cheaper price have the same thing. Howard Johnson is a much better for similar room and amenities.

Sea facing rooms are nice and have separate toilet and shower areas, with a hot tub on the balcony. Wifi was not working well for my conference calls but it looked like there were repairs made while I was there. Make sure to double check that you have a non smoking room at check-in or prepared to have to reiterate this, even if you booked non- smoking.

msg:Value for money at a decent location - quiet end of the beach with direct access to the beach across the road. Room was dark and musty, with an outside curtain that wouldn’t raise, making it even more cave like. Customer service was poor - called reception a number of times and the phone was never answered. Tea, coffee, toilet paper etc not replaced until I asked at reception. Food was ok, but service was slow at the restaurant. Breakfast decent. Star bucks coffee on site which was nice. Bar lady had no idea how to make drinks. The main pool (only one open) was quite cold but I think this is to be expected in January. Well manned by life guards. Overall, it was well priced and comfortable, but next time around I would also consider other places to stay.

You'd expect to pay 10x the price. 
Strangely, the toilet paper is only 1 ply, they could get some decent toilet paper. 
The air-conditioning is not too great. Probably just for this room...I haven't tried other rooms. 
I'd say 4.99/5 stars. 
The staff are also extremely helpful, kind and friendly. I'm very happy with my experience.

I requested to move rooms because my first one smelt quite damp and they changed my room immediately without hesitation. It’s extremely clean and the cleaning staff work really hard. The general decor of the room (walls) is a little old and out dated though. It is really close to the airport but not really within walking distance of many things so you either stay in the hotel to do everything or get a taxi somewhere (which was fine with me as they’re cheap anyway). The food at the hotel was great (breakfast and dinner buffet) and I was given afternoon tea vouchers for each day of my stay. I’d recommend to stay for sure 😊

My only regret is that the hotel buffet for dinner seems not to change very often: we checked it one day, ate there the second day and saw it again the next day and it was always pretty much the same. Food was really good so no complain here but a variation over the week would be nice.

The room was big with a garden view but unfortunately the room had dampness and smell like molds and fungus so asked the front desk to change the room.After waiting for 1.5 hrs we were given a room on third floor. The room was very old with no garden view instead we could see the hotel roof and the furniture was pretty worn out and the sofa was stained and unhygenic. The roof of the room has cracks and not properly maintained.The location of hotel is far from city center and no shops around. The charges for the room are really not worth it. Sorry but i was really unsatisfied with the services and the hotel overall.

msg:CHECK-IN: Went really smooth. We arrived early, but it was not an issue. No extra hassle with foreign passports. 

ROOM: Chose the super sea view room, which was really nice. Cleanliness level was good. I especially liked the bathtub on the balcony. The only minus points would be that there's no way to order room service other than calling (no online ordering like many hotels have now), and the air-con was a bit too powerful.

FOOD: Tested out all the restaurants - they were all very quiet during lunch and dinner time. Food was good though, but we were practically the only customers. Just a heads-up: if you order delivery to the hotel, note that it will only be delivered to the guard on the north gate, and not all the way to the lobby.

SPA: Tested it out, and the service was great! They had special prices for hotel guests and even lower if you go between 10 am and 6 pm. Really worth a try.

POOL: It was nice and again, very quiet. Temperature was a bit cold for my taste. There were plenty of sun loungers available. No pool bar though, and the pool itself is not very big (although there is another pool with poolside rooms, which looked cool). 

LOCATION: It's very quiet and very close to the beach, which is nice. Also not too far from the airport. However, the hotel is quite far away from the city center and all the action.

All in all, would really recommend, if you want a sea view and a nice quality hotel but don't want to be too close to the city center. The spa is definitely worth trying.

msg:We were group of 3 couples with children and we booked this hotel after comparing with several other hotels. The other closest option was Phoenix Island Resort which we did not book after checking the reviews about loud helicopter noise and not many options for dinning in the area. So we wanted a beach hotel so thought Crowne Plaza Resort Sanya Bay was perfect option. Was it really? Read on..
On Arrival we were greeted nicely by the hotel staff and were given keys to hotel room quickly even though it was way before the official check in time. So full marks for it.
Pictures of Trip are misleading and the hotel is worn out as soon as you enter. The statue at the Lobby and other decor looks older and need some serious repair work immediately. We took the the food package as difference was pretty less so we opted for it even though we wanted to explore other restaurants. Food at the restaurant was very delicious. There were few options on vegetarian but the taste was nice. Breakfast spread was very nice with plenty of options. 
Swimming pool was huge and very warm. We had waterproof speakers playing near water and enjoyed playing games in water. Also we did sheesha at the poolside which was refreshing. Now about the beach which is behind the pool and you need a cross a small narrow road. The beach next to hotel is a rocky beach and not safe for swimming. Just can sit at the shore and enjoy sunset. We went to Sanya Bay public beach which was huge and very scenic and beautiful. There were several hotels located opposite to the public beach which made us think that we should have booked at this location. Crowne Plaza was a good 10-15 minutes drive from here. So for location i will give a 3 rating only. 
Hospitality/ Service was commendable. Because of Air conditioning problem on Day 2 we were given upgraded suite room on Day 3 and also as there was a typhoon on last day of our stay and our yatch plan was cancelled the hotel extended our room till 4pm. 
Even though the hospitality and food was saving grace, I would not like to stay here again. At similar price range the hotel near the public Sanya Bay Beach are better. We did not have any idea about the areas and now after exploring Sanya and different beaches, my next stay will be in Yolang or Haintang Bay areas only. Overall my rating for Crowne Plaza Sanya Bay is 6.5 out of 10

However, I bought a package. After checking in, I found that the room reservation price was more than 400. I have a gold card and can also upgrade.
1,000 for two nights
But this night’s BBQ, I was told after check-in that it was not available. I changed it to something else. It was something I couldn’t finish. I came to Hainan to eat this? Two people, 500, eating here?
When checking in, none of the packages were given, not even the welcome drink.
After checking in, I found that one of the cans of Coke in the refrigerator was opened, so I saved half a can.

One of the pillowcases was extremely dirty after sleeping all night.

Do you think there will be a next time?

msg:The hotel I stayed in before was a pitfall, so I didn't dare to book it easily. I decided to stay in this hotel after I arrived and looked at the room. He Jiale at the front desk was very enthusiastic. After understanding our needs, he arranged for the porter to take us to see two rooms, one pool room and one sea view room. He also introduced the difference between the two room types to us in detail. After looking at the room, I finally decided to stay in the sea view room because the weather in Sanya is not suitable for staying in the pool room. The room is a bit humid, but it is very convenient to swim. The pool is directly outside the balcony. The view of the sea view room is beautiful. There is also a bathtub on the balcony, which is very suitable for taking pictures. The hotel is across a road to the beach. It is a bit far from the city, but very close to the airport, suitable for catching flights. It will be my first choice when I come to Sanya next time

When booking, I was a little worried that the hotel was a bit old. The taxi driver on the road also said that the hotels here are relatively old, but I still think that the hotel management of the InterContinental series should be good. Facts have proved that my choice is right. Although the hotel has a sense of age, it is well maintained. The quality of the bathroom and bedding is very high. As soon as I entered the room, the air conditioner had been turned on in advance, there was no damp smell, and the service was also very good. Thanks to the service of the housekeeper He Jiale, who was very kind and introduced the hotel's facilities and services in a very standardized manner, and patiently introduced the surrounding attractions. He took the initiative to add WeChat, and replied quickly every time he sent a message. Although he was on vacation, he still replied to my WeChat in time. The breakfast was satisfactory. Objective evaluation, a very cost-effective hotel. Although it cannot be compared with the five-star hotel in Haitang Bay, this hotel has all the facilities and services it should have.

msg:I spent a long time choosing a hotel before coming to Sanya. After staying at the Crown Hotel, I felt that I had made the right choice.
1. The hotel is large in European style, with an independent swimming pool outside. It is conveniently located and convenient to the airport/West Island/night market, etc.
2. The hotel provides us with a butler to provide special services. Butler He Jiale is very responsible and warm-hearted; our room was a bit damp at first, and he kept asking us if we wanted to change rooms, so that we would not make do. After we changed rooms, the room was no longer damp and we lived more comfortably; when we learned that our flight time was at night, he helped us delay check-out to five o'clock, so that we could rest as much as possible; he also helped us apply for a VIP lounge for free so that we could enjoy the food in a quiet environment after returning tired from the scenic spot. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
3. The hotel has a wide variety of breakfasts
4. The staff of the free travel photography provided by the hotel have a good service attitude, taking us to take pictures next to various scenery, and are also very patient.
5. The hotel can respond to our needs in a timely manner and deliver things to our door, and is also very patient when communicating.
6. The hotel room is very big and opposite is the sea. The water in the swimming pool downstairs is constant temperature and very playable.
This trip to Sanya is very happy. The service of Crown Hotel is in place and the experience is very good. I also wish the hotel will continue to prosper.

msg:A hotel worth praising, Crowne Plaza has once again taken a level up in my heart.
Service: This is unexpectedly good. As someone who has worked in the hotel industry for several years, every time I stay in a hotel, I habitually use my understanding of the industry to strictly look at the hotel. The housekeeper equipped in this hotel is really a very good service. My housekeeper is He Jiale, I call him Xiao He, who is responsive and responds to messages in seconds. I took my sister out, and he carefully helped me upgrade the room and arranged everything in the room according to my requirements. He was very enthusiastic and polite. Because Sanya is a tourist city, I feel that some people are not very friendly this time, but Xiao He is really enthusiastic and sincere. I recommend that everyone name Xiao He as a housekeeper next time. It is worth commending He Jiale.
Hotel: The room is large and clean. It is old but comfortable overall. It is not as humid as imagined. There is a swimming pool downstairs and free sleeve swimming rings.
Meals: Breakfast is OK and there are many categories.

The hotel facilities are all OK, but it feels a bit tacky. It would be better if the lobby didn't have those brands for the paid items, and there are a lot of power banks, which looks very good. But it is indeed convenient for tourists who go out.

Overall, the service is satisfactory, and the one-to-one service response of Spring Butler is very timely!

msg:This hotel is located in Sanya Bay, so the price is naturally lower.
Because Sanya Bay is close to the sea, it is naturally more humid.
Because it has been open for more than ten years, the facilities are indeed old.
However, it does not affect the magnificent beauty, as well as the freedom and comfort of enjoying the sea breeze at dinner.
Service: I couldn't sleep because of the humidity because I booked a pool room at the beginning, and I asked to change the room and immediately changed to a sea view. The service of this hotel is that they don't say much but they do it. Although there are some flaws, the price is low after all, it can be tolerated. You have to accept that this is the case in Sanya Bay.
So I give it five stars.

There is no one outside the row of hotels here at 9 o'clock in the evening. It is very dark~ But it doesn't affect it. The large bathtub on the balcony is very comfortable, and the hotel a**osphere is also good.
However, the equipment is quite old, and the door of the clothes cabinet is deformed and can't be closed, but I don't care much.
The service is very good. Someone will call in advance to add WeChat butler service, and will ask about the check-in experience, which Hilton does not have.
Overall, I will stay again~ The cost performance is relatively high.

Although the location is a bit out of the way, it is close to the airport, West Island and Tianya Haijiao, so I have stayed there many times before. It's still very friendly to come back after a year, and it feels like going home. The room I was given this time has a beautiful sea view, and watching the sunset on the balcony is simply wonderful. Although the hotel facilities and equipment are old, the service is still considerate and the housekeeper responded promptly. Since there are many things to do when traveling with family members, the housekeeper responded promptly even if I contacted him very late or early. It seems that the garden is more open than before, and it feels much bigger all of a sudden. Recently, there are still many guests in the hotel during off-peak travel, and there are also many people at breakfast. There are too few waiters and it is quite chaotic. After feedback to the housekeeper, the restaurant manager promptly apologized. The room service is quite satisfactory. The cleaning time is not fixed every day, but the cleaning is very clean. The buffet dinner I experienced this time was better than before, and the fish and oysters were very fresh. I also went to a fruit farmer near Tianya Town to pick mangoes. The harvest was good, but it was very hot and sunny. The overall experience this time is very good. I heard from the housekeeper that the service staff has been tense recently, so sometimes the service is difficult and not timely, but I still work hard💪. I will continue to choose it every time I go to Sanya in the future.

Across a quiet road is the Sanya Bay Beach. There are not many people and the sand is quite fine and clean. It is suitable for digging with children. Sha, it’s also beautiful to get up early in the morning and go for a walk to watch the sunrise.
Facilities and environment: It has everything that a five-star hotel should have. The lobby is very grand, with an outdoor swimming pool, a children's playground, a gym, and a mini zoo. The hotel has been open for a long time. I heard that it was a private club before. The decoration style and equipment It is inevitably a bit dated, but the maintenance and management of the Intercontinental Group is still in place. Even if there are any surprises during the stay, the hotel can respond quickly. To be fair, I am very satisfied.
Service: Very good. The housekeeper Spring added WeChat as soon as possible. When I checked in, because the reserved room type was not suitable for bringing a baby, I upgraded the room type. When you open the door, you can see the large bathtub on the balcony and the beautiful sea view. West Island The wharf lighthouse and shuttle boats slowly made white traces under the blue sky and white clouds. Because I have a four-year-old child, I made a lot of small requests, and the hotel was always able to handle them as soon as possible. Even if I asked for iodophor in the middle of the night, they were delivered quickly. I am very grateful.
Catering: During my two-night stay, I experienced breakfast, seafood BBQ and Chinese food at Shanhailou. The variety was rich and the chef prepared it well. Especially having dinner on the terrace, enjoying the sea breeze, enjoying Chinese and Western food, and listening to the hotel's resident singer singing in Chinese, English and Cantonese, it was a great experience.
Disadvantages: The hotel does not have a self-service laundry room. It is inconvenient to bring children back from attractions. You can't spend tens of thousands of dollars to have a small T-shirt washed by the hotel.
Overall, the hotel is very good. Next time I come to Sanya, I will consider Crowne Plaza first.

For example, I asked the housekeeper if there was a laundry service. Later I felt that the laundry price was a little expensive. I said that I wanted to do the laundry myself, and the housekeeper immediately gave me a few more hangers. For example, during the buffet in the morning, my daughter asked the waiter if there was any egg custard for her brother. To eat, the service staff specially steamed a bowl separately and asked if they would like to prepare another one at nine o'clock the next day. The breakfast was dazzling and had everything you need. Overall, I was very satisfied. There were also singers singing in the evening, which was very beautiful. The back door of the hotel is across the road from the beach. , there are not many people, it is very photogenic, and there is a beach for children to play. The complimentary coconut chicken hotpot and seafood set meal are very delicious. In short, I highly recommend this hotel. I speak from my own experience. I am not a shill. Chapter 1 I was very pleasantly surprised after my first stay. After all, I have always been a very picky person and I actually wrote so much. I wish the hotel staff a happy new year.

The young lady who sang in the evening was very cute, and Liang Jingru was so instant. The last two days in Hainan were basically spent in the hotel. The butler He Jiale arranged a room on a high floor with sea view in advance, and also sent fruits. The service answered all questions. Overall, I was very satisfied.

It may be that no one has stayed in my room for a long time and the facilities are old and in disrepair, so there is something wrong with some small parts. , so through the housekeeper's adjus**ent, I changed to a supreme sea view room. The view from the open balcony instantly relieved the fatigue of the journey. Lying on the chair on the balcony and overlooking the sea and sky, I felt relaxed. Fresh fruits were also given. The doorman's service is particularly enthusiastic and considerate. He is small but has great energy, and his attitude is very contagious👍. The housekeeper is also able to quickly solve customer needs. If he has to catch a flight for special reasons, he also specially arranges a punctual drop-off service. The driver Friendly attitude, one of my first choices next time I come to Sanya.

From the children's toothbrushes and slippers, you can see the care in service from the small details. The hotel is of a garden type, and you can reach the beach in a few minutes from the swimming pool. The water is very blue and there are few people, making it very photogenic. The hotel has many parent-child activities. It is particularly recommended to get a sea view room to watch the sunrise. Sitting on the balcony chair and overlooking the sea of ​​Sanya Bay is very healing. I will definitely come back to this hotel next time I come to Sanya!

It has complete facilities and considerate services. Unlike those flashy internet celebrity check-in places, this is really a good choice for a vacation in Hainan!

Hygiene: The overall hygiene is passable, but details need to be improved, such as the position of the air-conditioning outlet and bathroom exhaust fan. In addition, the room has an obvious damp/old smell. It is recommended to add an air purifier and dehumidifier.

Facilities: The hard decoration of the room is too old, which is also the main reason for the poor indoor air. It should be maintained and upgraded.

Breakfast: The variety of breakfast is average, and the addition is not timely. During peak holidays, new staff should be added to pay attention to the vacancies of dishes and drinks in a timely manner.

msg:The facilities and equipment of the hotels in Sanya Bay are indeed older than those in Haitang Bay, but it will not affect the stay experience too much, because I think the most important thing when going out is to experience five-star service.
  Maybe it was because of the proximity to the seaside and the abundance of wooden furniture. The room we first stayed in still had a slight musty smell. When I first entered the room, I was in a hurry to check in, so I came in before the room inspection was completed. The hotel housekeeper Spring was patiently checking the room for us. He helped us turn on the dehumidifier to dehumidify and remove the musty smell. After seeing us come in, he greeted us warmly, introduced us to the layout design of the room, told us the location of the minibar and the location of the tea and coffee bags, and reminded us We need to close the balcony door when turning on the air conditioner, otherwise moisture may return to the ground.
  Perhaps inspired by his enthusiasm, he also took the initiative to add his housekeeper on WeChat. Because I brought two elderly people and two children to stay here, the room was a little cramped. I wanted to pay to upgrade the room, so I called the housekeeper directly. They quickly showed me the Little Yellow Duck three-person suite and the family four-person small suite. In the end, I chose it. I got a small suite for four people. The room is very spacious and has two extra large beds. The most considerate thing is that there is no need to line up in the lobby to go through the formalities from beginning to end. The housekeeper Spring directly showed me the room, ran up and down, helped deliver luggage, and also prepared the room upgrade form in advance, as well as the room upgrade form. It was signed and written in the room, which was really efficient.
  Our whole family had a great time staying here, and we sincerely thank all the hotel staff for their work and the housekeeper for their considerate service. Hope the hotel will get better and better

msg:This time I was on a business trip and stopped by for two days.
Facilities: Although the facilities look relatively old, the style is very classic and American, so you won’t get tired of it and it’s eye-catching. I still like it very much!
Hygiene: The dry and wet separation is good. After staying for two days, I didn't feel that there was any problem with hygiene. Overall, it is relatively clean.

Environment:: The room is very large, which is the size I like. The toilet and washing area are also very large. The overall environment is very satisfactory. There are several restaurants in the hotel, which is very convenient for dining, and the Chinese restaurant prices are very affordable.
Service: There was an episode when I checked in, which was to arrange the twin beds into a double bed.
I made a reservation on Ctrip. At that time, it showed a king bed or a twin bed. There was no place for a note. I couldn't leave a note to the hotel to ask for a twin bed. Later, when I checked in at the front desk, I clearly told the staff that I wanted a twin bed. , the staff agreed, but still arranged a double bed. After entering the room, I ran out to the counter to complain, and then they communicated for half an hour before they gave us a double bed. They initially said that the double bed was full for our stay today. Unable to arrange it, they later said they would arrange it for us first. There was obviously a double bed, but we arrived earlier than other passengers and they didn't arrange it for us, resulting in a poor check-in experience. Fortunately, it was better to solve the problem satisfactorily and they gave us a garden double bed. , and it was on the 3rd floor. We were initially given the worst king-size bed on the 1st floor. It really affects the experience.
Fortunately, the room was quite satisfactory, and it did not affect my impression of the hotel or Sanya.

First of all, the hotel is indeed a good hotel, otherwise I would not have stayed there 13 times in 7 years. As soon as I arrived at the hotel, I felt like I was on vacation and felt relaxed all over.
Although the hotel is relatively old, its design was definitely several levels ahead at the time. It is still not bad among luxury hotels today, and its maintenance is also quite good. If you are worried that the hotel decoration is old, you can completely dispel your worries.
Regarding service, 23 years ago, the hotel’s management team was quite stable (the front desk all knew us and my wife), and the service level was also quite high. In May 2023, the management team was changed, and currently (October) it is still in the running-in period. It is indeed a bit rusty, but the management team is working hard and I believe that after the running-in period, the performance will be even more amazing.

msg:First of all, let’s talk about the distance. From the airport, it only takes 10 minutes to take a taxi to the hotel.
The lobby of the hotel is a bit interesting. You can drink Starbucks, but you can't earn points.
The check-in procedure is very simple and the ladies at the front desk are very friendly.
The room I stayed in was on the 7th floor. It was relatively large, with a good view, a large terrace and a bathtub. But I didn’t go there alone.
The layout of the room is a bit strange. There is a small door when entering, which opens directly to the bathroom. When you get to the bed, there is a door that allows you to enter the washroom and bathroom. It should be considered that when you go to bed at night, you can get up and go to the bathroom without disturbing you.
Then let’s talk about the experience of the bed. 🛏️It’s quite comfortable to sleep on, the softness and hardness are just right, and it won’t cause discomfort due to being too soft. However, the pillows are not very good. They are not as fluffy as in ordinary hotels and can be used as pillows. They are still a bit flat and not particularly comfortable.
Overall, the hotel is very good, but it is a little far away from shopping and some places to eat. It is recommended to relax alone. People who like quiet can choose it.

msg:1. Meals: We had dinner on the first floor of the hotel lobby on the first day. There were very few people. We were the only ones in the entire lobby. Because we were bringing children, the hotel gave us a children’s meal. It was very cute. I love eating so much that I ordered a few extra hot dishes, which cost more than 200 for three people (including the specials). Generally speaking, the dishes are quite satisfactory and the prices are relatively cheap among hotels.
The next day, we had a buffet barbecue on the open-air terrace on the second floor of the hotel. It was really amazing. In the raw food area, there are all fresh seafood. Familiar) + squid, etc. The squid is highly recommended. The kids ate four skewers, and the fried crab with black pepper. It was so fragrant. I felt like I could wrap up a pot of vegetables by myself... and the laksa, which was well done. Children usually don't like to eat rice noodles, so they ate a whole bowl this time. There are mainly beer areas and ice cream areas, as well as refreshments and coconut milk jelly, which are all very good. In addition, there are also singers on site. The little girl sings very well and has a great figure, haha~
In the next few days, breakfast was all buffet in the hotel, and there was a members area. I stayed in the non-member area once before because I didn't know I was a member. There was a beautiful young lady at the breakfast area. She was very nice. She took the initiative to help us check whether we were members, and invited us to have a meal in the members area. The members area had refreshments, seafood porridge, and vinegar hot pot, which were very rich~~ (recommended to everyone) If you become an InterContinental member, you will have a lot of delicacies that are not available in the non-member area, haha~) After the meal, they actively asked the children if they were full and asked us if we were satisfied with the meal. Our suggestions were quickly implemented, which is very efficient. . There were a lot of people during the National Day holiday. She took care of the guests very attentively and professionally. I specifically asked the young lady’s name. Her English name is Aimee and her Chinese name is Wang Yurong. Thank you very much for your service~ It’s great~
2. Swimming pool: There are two swimming pools in the hotel, one is a large one, and the other is a poolside swimming pool, which is connected to the room. There is a handsome lifeguard there. I chatted with him a lot and he also introduced me. The places to eat in the surrounding area are of good quality and cheap. He also told us to be careful when taking our children to the beach. He told us a few cases, which scared me so much that I only took my baby to the beach once, and basically spent the rest of the time playing in the hotel. He used to be in the navy, and he talked about some experiences, which was quite interesting, but unfortunately, he didn’t ask his name. I still have to thank him properly next time I see him~
3. Children's care activities: There are children's activities every day during the National Day period. I chose this hotel because of my fancy at that time. Usually one brother and one sister will take care of the whole process. I am quite reassured about the safety of the children. My favorite is making hamburgers, haha, I made it twice, and there is also a treasure hunt in the swimming pool. My brother and sister can actually put water in the water, and secretly tell the children the approximate location. The children have a lot of fun~ The activities arranged by the hotel are quite attentive, so praise them ~

After check-out, an unexpected situation occurred and the children's belongings were left behind. We called the hotel and Ms. Pari told us that the missing items had been collected and the hotel could help mail them. He was very patient throughout the whole process and helped take photos to confirm the items. Thank you very much Pari. I will recommend this hotel to friends who need to visit Sanya Bay.

Fortunately, I was upgraded to a higher-level room for free with charming views. I would like to thank the housekeeper for his meticulous and dedicated service. Secondly, I would like to express my gratitude to the housekeeper. I would like to express my gratitude to all the beauties at the front desk of the hotel, especially the one who welcomed me to check in. She had a sweet smile and was thoughtful and attentive. She explained to me in detail the rights and benefits of my room type, and arranged for someone to carry my luggage into the room. Of course , the other ladies at the front desk are also very kind and enthusiastic and efficient. Finally, let’s talk about the room conditions. The upgraded room with sea views has a good view. The room is large and bright. There is a balcony for drying clothes. The shower room has a large amount of water. The overhead shower is so comfortable. It is unmatched by many hotels. The room service is very efficient and the service is very good. However, the only slight drawback of the hotel is that the outside may be under maintenance and some old lawns are being renovated, so the scenery in some corners is still in the recovery period. The breakfast variety is not many and the taste is average, but this The hotel service is very satisfactory. They are patient, careful and efficient. Thank you to all the staff of the Crowne Plaza Hotel for their enthusiastic service this time!

Hygiene: There is nothing to say about hygiene. It is very clean. Even the edge of the double bathtub is not dusty at all. Since the temperature in Sanya is relatively high during this period and the temperature difference between the inside and outside of the room is relatively large, the hotel service staff also specifically asked us to close the balcony sliding door, turn on the air conditioner, and quickly dry the floor.
Environment: The hotel is only separated from the sea by a road. Across the sea is the West Island, and the view is very broad.
Service: The hotel concierge butler Li Zhihua contacted us by phone one day in advance. He thoughtfully asked us if we would bring children or the elderly, and arranged two adjacent room rates for us, and also upgraded the room type for free. Throughout the whole process, he was very considerate and asked if there were any service needs, and gave the children children's meals and fruits as gifts.

The lighting in the room was very dim and uncomfortable, and there was no bellman to help with luggage. I have to carry my own luggage. The toilet door is broken and the balcony door lock is also broken. I found out after the white clothes were stained on the clothes hanger. The most important thing is that I lost a Pola black ba cleanser, worth 750, the first time I contacted the guest room housekeeper He Jiale, because I was 100% sure where the things were left, and even the location was clearly remembered. I asked someone to check it out, but they said no, they had to wait for the guest to check out before they could go see it. Can I still find it after checking out? That's for sure. The reply to me was that the guest had checked out and there was no belongings of mine. So if I put something there, the staff cleaning didn't see it? Is this a dereliction of duty? I found that it was missing. Please help me find it quickly. I won’t find it until the guest checks out the next day? Is this a dereliction of duty? Also, we checked in at two o'clock on the 22nd and checked out at eight o'clock on the morning of the 23rd. The deposit was not refunded until after six o'clock in the afternoon after I asked. I don't understand how it works... I can't compliment this kind of hotel. I will never stay here again, be careful and don’t lose more than you gain in pursuit of value for money! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !

The girl at the front desk was very careful, she made arrangements for us and came over to deliver the luggage to the room. The hotel is under the banner of InterContinental. The room rate per night is very low compared to what we have stayed in these days, but the service and hardware facilities are definitely good. The overall European-style building has a round bathtub on the balcony. Looking up, you can catch your eyes. It is the sea, and you can still hear the sound of the waves at night, which is especially healing. This hotel is only a 9-minute drive from Tianya Haijiao. We came back from breakfast early in the morning and had a short rest before checking out and going to other places. After receiving the check-out call, Li Yan came to the room with a young man with a northeast accent to help us push our luggage down. Li Yan was very considerate I asked about the experience of staying, and if there is any suggestion. Keep sending my luggage to the car and watch us leave. Crown Crown, whose fee is not high, can have such a thoughtful service from a little girl like Li Yan, and I really have to give it a sincere compliment. Hope your hotel business is getting better and better. Friends and relatives who come to Sanya again will definitely recommend it.

Finally, when a little girl was free, I quickly asked if I could apply here. After checking in, I only gave the room card. I thought all items were included. It is included in the card and does not require a separate voucher. As a result, the child went swimming in the pool the next day and was told that he must have a voucher, otherwise the child would never be allowed to go into the water. The child called me to ask, and after calling the front desk to inquire, I was told that there was one, but it was not available. Give it to me, isn’t there a unified service standard? The room is large, the facilities are very old, there are small ants and bugs on the sofa, and the two large beds are very damp, maybe because it is close to the sea during the rainy season. There was no effective communication between their depar**ents. The child did not want to change hotels and had to extend his stay. However, when he came back from an outing, he found that the room had not been cleaned at all. When he asked the cleaning staff, he learned that the front desk did not inform them that we had extended our stay. Then the fruit and toiletry set for the renewal order were finally delivered after many, many urgings. After staying in so many five-star hotels in Sanya, this one has the worst service, worst facilities, and poor breakfast I have ever encountered. This hotel will be blocked from now on and I will never stay there again! ! !

The lady at the front desk, Meiyu, upgraded us to a sea view room for free, with a large balcony and a large round bathtub. The key is that you can see the beautiful beach and sunset, and you can also see the plane landing from above🛬️. The view is great and it is very quiet at night with no noise from planes taking off or landing at all. The young lady also applied for free breakfast and children's set meal for us... a bunch of benefits. The hotel is just 2 minutes away from the beach by the seaside road. There are many snails on the beach that are different from those in Beach Bay, and there are many crabs, and there are small fish at low tide. We were very lucky and even encountered blue tears. The hotel's swimming pool is also good, and the lifeguards are very serious and responsible. Next time I come to Sanya, I will choose this Crowne Plaza for vacation.

msg:The housekeeper Jane is still very good. At the beginning, the front desk did not recognize the membership information, and she was quite satisfied with the upgrade service. There were some twists and turns during the meal. Although the overall catering level was lower than before, she was still very serious about her work. After the meal, she also gave coconut rice, but the appearance was a little bit poor.

It's no exaggeration to say I didn't sleep all night and checked out at 5 in the morning. The smell in the room is hard to describe. Don't be sure The swimming pool room is damp and wet. The facilities are too old. The key is that the taste is incomprehensible. The afternoon tea in the lobby has not been served for two hours. Crown has stayed in many hotels. This one is the worst. The welcome fruit is not available until check-out It’s the first time I saw only a bottle of Sprite in the drinking water bar...the swimming ring in the swimming pool needs to be rented, and you need to pay...I have stayed in so many five-star hotels in Sanya, although this one is the cheapest, because I left Sanya Airport It's relatively close, it's really better to live fast, the room facilities are too bad, all the links are only served by the little brother at the front desk...but what's the use...I have rashes on my arms, and I started I thought it was a physical problem when I saw other guests commenting on the rash. Now it seems that it is a hygiene problem. There are a lot of rashes... Poor service and poor environment
Service: Poor Poor
Hygiene: Poor, my baby and I had rashes all over our bodies, and the swimming pool was not clean

Environment: Dust can be seen everywhere, the management group is too bad
Facilities: too old.

The front desk is staffed 24 hours a day. Before I checked in, the housekeeper He Jiale had contacted me in advance and bought the crown garden. Package, directly help us upgrade to the supreme sea view room! The check-in experience is really good, the butler is very professional and nice, and helped us solve many small problems.
Room facilities: There are all kinds of washing facilities. The hotel looks a little old, and the exterior building is corroded by the sea breeze and looks a little old, but it doesn't affect the mood of staying.
Things to do nearby: Very close to the West Island, the west-facing rooms of the hotel can see the pier,
Cost-effectiveness: I am traveling in the off-season, and the price-performance ratio is super high
Restaurant: There are not many varieties of Chinese and Western buffets, but they don’t overwhelm you. Everything is delicious. There are still dolls in the restaurant today, so cute!
Room view: Supreme sea view room, really happy!

The hotel has convenient parking and the room area is large. Although it is an old hotel, the facilities are well maintained. The front desk service of the hotel is also relatively good, and we were upgraded to a sea view room for free.
The only minus point is that the hotel package we booked, one of the coconut chicken hot pot dinners, reduced at least four dishes without any prior notice. We asked the relevant service personnel and got a reply that the dishes have been adjusted, and these few items are gone. I hope that this kind of thing can attract the attention of the hotel and improve the service quality of related projects.

Let me talk about the service first: the butler at the front desk, Spring, is very proficient in business and has a great attitude. He helped upgrade the sea view room
Environment: There is a sea view along the street, which is very convenient. The fly in the oin**ent is that there are no beach chairs now, and it is said that it is under control;
Food: There are many food streets nearby, basically 2 kilometers away, and takeaway is also very convenient; it is also very close to Tianya Haijiao;
Transportation: It’s really convenient to go anywhere. Airports, scenic spots, bus stations, and urban areas are all very convenient. I must praise it👍🏻
A hotel with super high cost performance, it will be booked directly on the return journey, and I will lock it here when I come to Sanya in the future

The hotel is very big, like a castle, and there are many places to visit. Once you come in, you don't want to go out. The room was upgraded for me, and I was given a lot of coupons. The view of the sea from the balcony is beautiful, and I took a lot of photos. The butler, He Jiale, was very considerate. He gave us breakfast and a lot of game coins. Before leaving, he gave us the toys in the game console that our children hadn't caught. Really good! The last two photos of Phoenix Island are also attached. The price is twice that of 👑. There is no harm if there is no comparison. Next time I come to Sanya, I will still choose Crown.

The shower facilities are Hansgrohe, and there are a lot of toiletries. The breakfast is rich and delicious Yes, hesitation. We arrived very early and were in a hurry to go out to play. Ms. Ada Wang at the front desk helped me solve my luggage and toiletries problems in time. Thank you very much. I will stay again when I come back later, mainly because it is close to the airport. By the way, those who like to see the sea view must choose a sea view room, and you can also watch the sea view while taking a bath.

It is only a 6-kilometer drive from the airport ➕ The beach is just across the road from the back door of the hotel. There are few people, so it is easy to take pictures!
Go for a swim in the swimming pool after dinner, and listen to the live live while swimming at night.
The pancakes and fruits for breakfast are also delicious, and many people are willing to wait in line~
From the balcony of the executive room, you can see the endless blue sea. In the morning, the sun shines into the room with the sound of waves to usher in a new day~
Living in this hotel is really comfortable, this is the real travel~

The breakfast variety is very rich. The bread and pastries are like Hainan’s unique taro crispy meat bread. The wide rice noodles are pretty good. There are also a lot of coupons. I used a Starbucks to buy one get one free. The cherry blossom coffee is delicious, and there are 5 Zhang free shooting, no hidden consumption. Thank you very much for the help of the front desk manager Eason for arranging the room, the sea view is very beautiful

Good buffet breakfast. Free cookies upon check-in. The hygiene of the bedding was flawed, but after reporting it, a replacement was arranged immediately, and a fruit plate was included.

Cross the road in front of the hotel and you will be able to reach the beach. The feeling here is different from Yalong Bay. If the beaches of Yalong Bay are naive, sunny and a little shy girls in their early twenties, then Sanya Bay is bold, refreshing, and slightly wild with a light and familiar attitude. In short, each flower is in each eye, and you need to experience it yourself~

msg:The decoration of the room is quite outdated, like all the hotels under the InterContinental Group, but the room is really big. I booked a supreme sea view room, and I got an executive sea view room for free upgrade. It faces the atrium, and the beach is just outside the back door of the hotel. This is very convenient, and the swimming pool has a constant temperature. , the child likes it very much 😍.
However, there was a small episode on the day of check-in. After checking in to the room that was upgraded for free, the water pipe under the washbasin in the bathroom leaked. After reporting for repairs, it seemed to be resolved on the same day, but the water still leaked in the next few days. When you found this situation, contact the front desk to see if you can change the room directly , but was rejected, I don't know if it was the reason for the full room, but this experience is very bad.
When I checked in, the lady at the front desk said that there would be a staff member who would contact me in advance to confirm whether I needed to prepare toiletries for my little friend, but no staff member actually contacted me. I found none when I got to the room, and it took a while to deliver them after I contacted the front desk.
The breakfast buffet has more western dishes and less Chinese style. There is a dining area for members, and I think other five-star hotels have less variety.
The hotel is really close to the airport, but it’s not noisy at night. You may still hear the sound of planes during the day. It’s a bit far away from the city, but it’s convenient to take a bus at the door. However, the bus in Sanya is charged according to the distance , unlike Chengdu, where you can sit together for 2 yuan.

The architectural style of the hotel is quite special, it is Baroque style, the hotel upgraded us to a sea view room, the room is relatively spacious, there is a round bathtub on the balcony, and the beach can be reached from the hotel through the small road at the door.
The housekeeper, Li Zhihua, is very thoughtful. He called us in advance and added WeChat. During the check-in period, he would remind us of some information and respond to our needs in a timely manner. Finally, when we checked out, the child was still taking a nap, which delayed us for half an hour.
p.s. A few years ago, my husband (who was my boyfriend at the time) and I spent New Year’s Eve in this hotel. It was our first year together. Now the baby is over one year old. This time staying again also reminded us many memories.

msg:Our exclusive butler He Jiale has a very good service attitude and is basically responsive. He helped us solve many difficult problems during the journey👍🏻
The overall service of the hotel is also very considerate, except for some mosquitoes at night near the sea, there are no other shortcomings. The scenery is very beautiful. The breakfast variety is very rich and the sound insulation effect is good. The butler also helped us arrange the airport drop-off service throughout the whole process. Next time if we have the opportunity to come back to Sanya, we will choose to stay at Crowne Plaza🌊
Thanks for the great hospitality in March!

msg:The Crowne Plaza Resort Sanya Bay I stayed at this time is located on the golden coastline of Sanya Bay, only a 3-minute walk to the beach. The overall decoration of the hotel is very high-end and grand, the attitude and sense of responsibility of the service staff are very satisfactory, the layout of the room is reasonable, the space is spacious, the shower and the bath are separated, the bath is on the balcony, full of a**osphere, and the dry and wet separation is done very well. It is very suitable for traveling with children or the elderly. The sand on the beach opposite the hotel is clean and soft, and there are very few people. They are basically guests staying in the same hotel. The swimming pool in the hotel is divided into several areas. Both children and the elderly can enjoy the joy of playing in the water. The breakfast dishes are a bit monotonous. To be honest, it is not as good as the Crowne Plaza Hotel Qingdao that I have been to. In short, this time I took my parents and children to choose Crowne Plaza Sanya Bay. My family members recognized and liked it very much. I also felt a little sense of accomplishment. If I have the opportunity to come to Sanya, this hotel will definitely be the first choice. I also thank luckie, the housekeeper at the front desk, for treating us Meticulous service!

msg:Overall, the location of the hotel is close to Tianya Haijiao and West Island, very close to the beach, just cross the road and there are not many people. It is not as lively as Yemeng. It is more than ten kilometers away from Yameng Corridor, and it costs about 30 yuan to take a taxi. The lights of Phoenix Island are almost invisible. The hotel is a bit old, but the service is very good. Leah who received us was very thoughtful. He added WeChat, and he could deal with any needs immediately. He was very considerate in asking about the health and wellness every day. The sanitation of the hotel is good, the water pressure is very high, and the bath is enjoyable. The hotel's swimming pool looks very nice and beautiful, but when I go swimming, I feel that the water is turbid. The water quality is very poor. There may be too much disinfectant in the water, and my mouth feels astringent. I took a few photos and stopped swimming. up. The hotel is relatively remote, and there is nothing to eat around. The hotel itself has good food and beverages. We ate a coconut chicken hot pot and a Chinese set meal, and we were very satisfied. In short, if you want to play in the water, it is not recommended. You should go to Tianya Haijiao and West Island to enjoy the world of two people. By the way, there is a double bathtub on the balcony of the hotel, and it is also equipped with an electric blind. It is very good to enjoy the beautiful scenery of the garden and the sea while taking a bath.

Wenchang chicken was served to me, and after I refused, I was given two options, spicy chicken/kung pao chicken, because the appetizer had already been eaten and there was no way to return it, and the number of shrimp was not only small, but not fresh. After reporting the situation with the front desk staff, the restaurant gave me a 15% discount on the phone. After arriving at the restaurant, the staff regretted and told me that they could only compensate me with two coconuts or small cakes. I was really speechless. If you can't do it, don't take this kind of set meal. The hotel restaurant at night is really not good. Avoid lightning, everyone~

When I first arrived at the hotel lobby, it was rare to see such a big hotel lobby without air conditioning (it’s not that the air conditioning is not on, it’s that there is no air conditioning😅😅).
The room was damp and musty.
  The guest service center is the first to take responsibility over the phone
  I can understand that the hotel facilities and equipment are a bit outdated. After all, it opened in 2018.
The service attitude of the guest service center is also poor. Yesterday, the call from the guest service center to the front desk was not answered for a long time.

msg:A big family travels at different peaks, but I still feel that the number of tourists for three people is only increasing, and there are still so many people. The first stop is Crown Crown, which is relatively close to the scenic spot and has convenient transportation. As an old brand Crown Crown, the price is reasonable , but I feel that although the service can keep up, it is a bit difficult. There may be a lot of customers calling at the same time. If you need a service call, you need to wait for a while, and those few service personnel are on the day of check-in. You can still see them when you check out. There are many guests When there are fewer people, you have to wait to check in, and it seems very difficult to watch the front desk service personnel answer the phone and check in and check out the guests. Especially when the concierge is needed to serve and help, seeing them push the carts to send other guests, I can't bear to work hard for them. I hope the hotel can send more staff. After all, the front desk is a hub. Guests have to find the front desk if they have any needs. But what I have to praise is that although they are so busy, they really serve in a timely manner. They will apologize for the long wait and tell us the reason. This is where we can understand. The second is that although the hotel floor is low, it is unstoppably right by the sea. Whether you go directly to the beach or stay in the room, you can enjoy the complete sea view room, which is very beautiful. Moreover, there is a large bathtub on the balcony, and the equipment is also complete. It is not too comfortable to enjoy the sea view together. Those who want to arrange to go to scenic spots can decisively choose to stay in this hotel.

The beach across the road is nice and the sea is clear. The hotel's swimming pool is so big, the bubble show is the highlight, the time is long, and the foam is particularly rich. Make balloons for kids at breakfast, this flower is so pretty. The speed of replenishing the quality of breakfast varieties needs to be improved. The Northwest cuisine on the first floor of the hotel is particularly good.

The hotel contacted me by phone one day in advance, and asked in detail about when to arrive at the hotel, whether there are children and need children's products, which is really great. Arriving at the hotel by car, there are underground or open-air parking lots to choose from; check-in is also very convenient and fast, and will help guests send large luggage to the room. If you are bringing children, the hotel not only has a children's pool, but also has different children's play activities to participate in at different times of the day. The overall hotel environment is excellent, the daily room hygiene service is also very timely, and the staff is very polite👍👍👍 Sanya Bay where it is located is not as crowded as other places. In short, if you bring children and want a quiet surrounding environment, I think this is the best place.

advantage
The service is good, the hotel itself has many facilities, many restaurants, and the service staff have a good attitude and help with luggage. The room service is fast, and the view from the sea view room is okay.
shortcoming
The airport is a bit noisy, and the facilities are a bit outdated, and it's too far to go to the city. The public beach is very lively.
Overall, 4 points, a hotel with a sense of age. pretty good.

I was told at noon that if I waited for the tenth floor, it would be after five o'clock, and then I chose eighth Lou, I stayed for three consecutive days and told me that the water in the minibar can only be free once. I just want to know, if I place three orders in a row, will it be free three times? When I arrived, there were few parking spaces, so I parked in the third parking space at the door. There are two charging piles next to me, but my third parking space has no charging piles at all, only the first and second parking spaces. At midnight, the front desk called me and asked me to move the car. It was the owner of the car. I don’t know if it was because my car was out of battery and told me to move the car. After I went downstairs, the owner of the car communicated with me. It was very unpleasant. I saw a two-box car parked in the first parking space. It was a local car and not a tram. I negotiated with the security guards and asked me to move to the garage. My car was more than two meters high and I couldn’t get out. I was In other words, your front desk called me and told me to come down. I seriously doubted that I was asked to move the vehicle from other provinces. Why not call a local vehicle that can go to the ba*****t to move the car? In the end, the security guard found me a car that was in the garage of the vehicle hall, and asked me to park the car in reverse. However, the security guard was still very difficult. I was angry. I went to the front desk to ask and complain, and the front desk told me that the call was from another car owner. , It has nothing to do with them, but I received a call from the front desk, and you didn't come forward to negotiate, but asked me to get up at midnight to negotiate by myself? I was very dissatisfied. When I went to the swimming pool the next day, I found that only one swimming pool was open, and there was no other water. The water in the pool view could not go down. I hope that there is room for improvement. I will not comment, just a description one time

The hotel is located in Sanya Bay, and the hotel helped us arrange two rooms next to each other, which is convenient for children to play together. A five-star hotel with mediocre facilities. The advantage is that it is very close to the sea, just across the road when you go out. After eating a buffet in the hotel, the children are unwilling to go out. The rest are ordered takeaway, which is more convenient. We stayed for two nights and went to Tianya Haijiao, Xiaodongtian and Nanshan Temple, and spent the rest of the time playing in the hotel pool. The children in the pool like it more.

In the members' dining area for breakfast, the lady who cooks the noodle seems to be asleep. She has to listen closely to her speech, but she can't hear it at all.

I can take time out from my busy work to take a good vacation for myself, so that my body, which is suffering along with me, can relax for a short period of time. This is a trip that has been planned for a long time. Before I came, I searched for comparisons and the first one I chose was the reliable Crowne Plaza. The most important thing was that I received a call from Eason, the hotel's exclusive butler, before I came, which made me decide to stay. Because there are too many uncertainties. Now the general environment is affected again. However, the hotel is still very user-friendly, and Eason is also very enthusiastic and patient in helping to understand the epidemic policies. Give some decisive advice. After many twists and turns, we finally arrived in Sanya. As soon as we arrived at the hotel, we saw a very impressive building. The lobby is spacious and bright. As Chris**as approaches, there is a big Chris**as tree in the lobby🎄, and there are also decorated gifts🎁. I checked in quickly when I arrived at the hotel. I am very grateful to the housekeeper for the advance arrangement. The sea view in the room is very beautiful. This is the first time I have come to Sanya. It is the first time I feel the sea breeze blowing against my face up close. I can say that I am so happy. I recommend that when you come to Sanya, you must book a sea view room, and it should be on a high floor. Otherwise, you won’t be able to feel the majesty of the sea at all. Because I was in a hurry on the road, I didn't go out to play after checking in. I simply had dinner at the hotel. The taste of coconut chicken was good for the first time. It was sweet but not greasy. The soup was also very delicious and fragrant. The chicken was also relatively tender. The taste is perfect, the cleanliness and view of the room are excellent, the cleaning is very thorough, and I slept very comfortably all night. The bed is soft and the pillows are soft. Because I have a trip ahead, I only experienced it for one night before leaving for other Bay Areas. However, I will still spend a few days in the future to come here and stay in this hotel for a few nights. Ending this vacation by the way. Finally, I am very grateful to Eason for helping with arrangements and giving pertinent suggestions, which gave me a perfect start to the entire vacation.

The hotel facilities are a bit old, but this is unavoidable. The sanitary ware is all from Villeroy & Boch. You can still see it Come out of the luxury of the year. Went to the gym and swam, the pool is big and nice. Overall good value for money. The next time I come to Sanya, I will stay here again, and I was given a beautiful souvenir when I left the hotel.

msg:This time I stayed at Crowne Plaza Sanya Bay, and I was attracted by the sculptures of the hotel as soon as I entered the door. The hotel as a whole is in Baroque style, with a bold and bright layout. I like this feeling very much.
The hotel is by the sea, and all rooms have balconies, where you can drink afternoon tea or take a bath while watching the sea. If you are in a suite, you can see the sea while lying on the bed. It feels super comfortable and relaxing.
The environmental design and room design of the old five-star hotels are good, but the service management is slightly worse than that of the new five-star hotels. Generally, two bottles of water are not given to a room. The afternoon tea is very simple, the juice is not freshly squeezed, and the afternoon tea is stored The freezer for snacks and fruits is the same, and there is a little smell every time it is opened. The hotel restaurant is particularly dimly lit, giving people the feeling that the overall a**osphere is not clean. But it is also worthy of the price, because it is already very close to the people compared to the five-star hotels in Haitang Bay. The hotel is very close to the airport, just ten minutes away.
The hotel does nucleic acid every day, which is very convenient.
There is no particularly good dining place near the hotel, except for the food stalls in the food street a few kilometers away, the environment is mediocre. If you bring children, hygiene can only be compromised.
Adults are recommended, the hotel environment is good, the price is relatively close to the people, across the road is the beach, close to the beach and the airport, it is convenient to do nucleic acid, there is a beautiful swimming pool for taking pictures, and the hotel building is also very distinctive. During the stay at the hotel, I met new people who took wedding dresses , There are also some sea projects on the beach. It is not particularly recommended if you bring very young children, there is no special children's pool, there are fewer food options, and the hotel does not have services such as parent-child activities.
Special thanks to Nancy Fu Yingdi for upgrading the room type for us. The manager Zhong Xiaoling is amiable and methodical in handling emergencies. She uses her best efforts to serve the infected and meet the needs of customers. Thank you!

msg:When I arrived at the hotel in the afternoon, the sun was just right. The lady at the front desk was upgraded to a king bed room with a sea view. The moment I entered the room, I was very pleasantly surprised. Lying on the bed, I could watch the sea and watch the beautiful sunset. The bed was soft and comfortable.
Although it is close to the airport, we didn't hear the sound of the plane.
There are a lot of food around, and it is very convenient to order takeaway. The Along Seafood Farmhouse next to it and the Qingbuliang opposite it are delicious. The swimming pool downstairs is open, and there is a small door at the back to go out and cross the road to the sea. The sea breeze is pleasant and the sea view is vast.
There is a free commercial vehicle for pick-up and drop-off, and it takes ten minutes to get to the airport, which is super convenient
Although the hotel is a bit old, the service is good. The little girl at the front desk is very nice when we check in or check out. The disposable slippers for the room are delivered as soon as possible.
Because I used the Sanya consumption voucher plus the room upgrade, it is a super five-star enjoyment in terms of cost performance!

msg:When I came to Sanya this time, I originally planned to go to Haitang Bay, but I chose to stay at Crowne Plaza, which is closer to the hotel. I was also attracted by the hotel's decoration style and baroque style. I was not disappointed. It looks very beautiful, the statue can be shocking, completely holiday style, and the hotel luggage operator is also very discerning, and can take the initiative to help open the door to take the luggage, the hotel butler Eason's service is more meticulous, taking care of us along the way, The detailed introduction to the check-in and also sent us back to the room. During the period, I felt that the location of the room arranged for the first time was not the type of room I wanted (because I stayed last year, so I still want the same as before) eason really spared no effort to help run Arrangements for running up and down, sending cards to help carry luggage and show the room, the children are really excellent and friendly, the hotel room is still as clean as always, and the transportation is convenient to go to the scenic spot. Tourists come here to experience for two nights. You can just take a stroll around the scenic spots here. You can go directly to the airport. It is very convenient. The hotel environment is also very good. There are gardens, swimming pools, supermarkets, and sea view platforms , I like the type of breakfast and the taste. I strongly recommend you to come and stay. You can find Eason, who is very kind and polite.

msg:Basically, every time I come to Sanya, I will stay at the Crowne Plaza Hotel, which is of excellent quality as always. First of all, the location of the hotel is really close to the airport, and there are also large and small scenic spots nearby: West Island, Tianya Haijiao, Nanshan Temple, Big and Small Caves, Coconut Dream Corridor, etc. The infrastructure of the hotel is good, and the resort feels full. The hotel swimming pool is very beautiful, and the photos are very beautiful. It would be even better if there is afternoon tea by the swimming pool. The hotel also has a swimming pool room, but it's a bit humid. I'll try it again next time. There is no private beach in the entire sea area of Sanya Bay. The hotel is very considerate. Now it can provide nucleic acid services to the guests staying in the hotel every day during special times. This is highly praised. It is convenient for many guests and can reduce risks and waiting time. The hotel room is relatively good. It is a high-end hotel. After all, it is a five-star hotel with first-class service. The room is very close to the sea, only one road away. The view from the room is very good, and you can see the Guanyin on the Sea of Nanshan Temple , You can also enjoy the sunset of Sanya Bay while taking a bath. I highly recommend you to come and experience the beautiful baroque bathtub, Ba Shi, and the hotel service is super attentive and considerate. The concierge welcomes you at the door and helps you with your luggage, because This time I was traveling with my family and I had a lot of luggage. I am very grateful to the concierge for his thoughtful service and helping to deliver it to the room. The front desk is also very professional. I saw a family who helped upgrade the room type and arranged for the next door The room was given to our family, which is convenient for us to take care of the elderly in time. I am really grateful to the handsome housekeeper Xiao Li who has been providing warm service during the stay. He has been helping to solve problems, deal with troubles, and advise us on the way to travel, every day They all remind you to do nucleic acid and pay attention to sun protection. I visited the scenic spots near the hotel first, and I recommend you to go to Nanshan Temple, which is super suitable for punching in and taking pictures. The pictures are super beautiful, and if you have time after shopping, you can also drop by Tianya Haijiao. By the way, Tianya Haijiao is now open for free. , is also a 5A-level scenic spot in Sanya, it is worth a visit, in short, I am really glad that I chose the right hotel for this landing tour, so that our family can relax a bit, and we will definitely come back when we return.

When checking in at the front desk, the housekeeper Doris was very enthusiastic. He asked my request specially, upgraded the sea view room, and arranged for us to see the sunset island room. The scenery is really beautiful. There was also a welcome arrangement in the room. It was a special surprise when we entered. Knowing that we had not eaten at noon, he also invited us to have afternoon tea and let us fill our stomachs 😘 He also gave us welcome fruits and small biscuits when we left the store. Overall, the price/performance ratio is still very high, the service is particularly in place, and I am very satisfied.

When you get off the bus, the concierge will take the initiative to open the door and help you carry your luggage. I was able to arrange the room according to my request. I thought it was very good to upgrade the room specially. The speed was very fast. There were many flavors of breakfast. I was so picky and I was conquered🤣🤣, the hotel can do nucleic acid every morning from 9:00 to 10:30, It's too convenient for travelers to go out and find a nucleic acid spot to bask in the sun. It's just YYDS, but it's still a bit of a fly in the oin**ent. The hotel is a bit old, it should have been open for a long time, the facilities are a bit outdated, the room air conditioner can't be adjusted by itself, or it's very cold , or don't open it, it still smells a bit musty, but after these trea**ents, there are no such problems, the remedy is still very timely, only the swimming pool is open in the hotel, and the facilities are still a bit lacking, I hope more entertainment facilities can be added, or hope It can be better, and the price-performance ratio is still very high. I'm going to see what activities are on Double Eleven and stock up on the Chinese New Year before bringing my family here.

msg:I read the reviews online and the location of the service is okay, so I came here to try it out for a night. I didn't expect to find the hotel after staying there. The hotel is close to the airport, within a 15-minute drive! The room I booked saw the plane wind and landed, but the hotel's sound insulation is still good. After closing the balcony window, there is no sound. You can still see the sea view from the room. The West Island tourist area is clearly visible in front of you. It was so worth it to get to the sunrise.
The hotel has a buffet breakfast, and the food is quite rich. There are more than a dozen kinds of Western-style bread with different tastes. It is dazzling. I don't know which one to eat for those with difficulty in choosing syndrome. Don't worry if you don't like Western-style breakfast. , There are also several types of Chinese porridge, noodles are all 😍😍 and the freshly made pancakes and fruits are the most touching. After breakfast, we take the children to play in the children's playground, and the children can also have a great time. The dishes of the Chinese restaurant in the hotel are also cheap and inexpensive! It tastes great!
For those who love sports, the gym must go to the gym. It has complete facilities and is open 24 hours a day. Due to the epidemic, there will still be service staff who will patrol from time to time. They will take the initiative to say hello when they meet, which makes me feel very comfortable haha, very polite 😂😀
Handmade cookies: It is said that the hotel chefs made them by themselves, they are delicious 😋
300 yuan coupons for yachts to go to sea or 100 yuan coupons for scattershots: a good experience, now there are very few tourists, and the attitude of the service staff is not crowded
The reception at the front desk of the hotel is also super fast, and some people take the initiative to help with luggage🧳
Overall, the experience is good. The hotel room service staff will greet you when they meet you. Thank you for your attentive service. Come back to this hotel next time

msg:I have been to Sanya many times. Every time I come to and get off the plane, I always stay at this hotel. The hotel service is really attentive. Since the little brother who checked in at the front desk still remembers me 😯 Too surprised 🫢 Check in is also very fast. You'll be in your room in minutes! The room has arranged a room on a high floor for me. The reason for the mask is that there are very few people in the entire Sanya scenic spot, hotel and hotel. I think it is the most correct choice to choose to travel to Sanya at this time😄

Service: The hotel's breakfast service is very attentive. Knowing that it is inconvenient for me to bring my child to pick up the meal, I can take the initiative to pick up the meal for me, making the child laugh. The child is so happy, and I am even happier. Thank you, Yun Jumei, the member area attendant Serve attentively! The room service is also very fast. I asked for a children's slippers and toothbrush and the elder sister delivered it within a few minutes. I like the speed of the room elder sister 👍

Hygiene: The overall hygiene of the hotel is clean. After all, it is a five-star hotel, so I feel at ease in this area.

Environment: Beautiful, the room can watch the sunset ❤️ It is also close to the seaside, and the hotel pool attendant also provides us with sand digging tools with children digging sand🧰Intimate💕
Facilities: also good, the facilities are fully equipped!
It is recommended to stay here again next year!

msg:I have always wanted to travel to Sanya, but due to special reasons, this itinerary has been delayed again and again, and now I can finally arrive in Sanya, I am very excited, with a trace of excitement, I booked this hotel early before, looking at the online reviews It is still very high, and the hotel decoration looks very a**ospheric. The overall appearance is in line with the resort style. The front desk is not bad compared to other inland hotels. The overall long counter looks like sitting or higher than other hotels. The counter is much more pleasing to the eye. When you arrive at the hotel, there will be a doorman concierge who will open the door and help with luggage. The front desk handles things very quickly. Check-in is completed in less than a few minutes. Because you called in advance, you can check in early, but the hotel Still gave a surprise, the front desk helped to upgrade to an executive sea view room, the room is beautiful, the decoration style is Western-style, and the bright spot is the super large bathtub on the balcony of the room. I have seen other hotels. The bathtubs are basically rectangular. I still like the oval baroque bathtub in this hotel. Imagine enjoying the sea view while taking a bath. Bath salt hotels can be equipped with them. The hotel has a lot of facilities. I also took a look at the gym. Sports, the hotel also has piano activities at 2 o'clock every day. It can be recommended for families with children. The neighborhood is quiet and very close to the seaside. It is the first choice for family travel and the first choice for those returning home. The hotel has its own shuttle bus. I have to say that the basic shuttle buses are those that are far from the airport, similar to those in Yalong Bay and Haitang Bay, but the hotel is so close to the airport and there are shuttle buses, which are really considerate and good for customers. . The hotel is very clean as a whole, and the garden is relatively tidy. Basically, the service staff will greet you warmly and ask your needs, if there is anything you can help. This is very good. I had Chinese food in the hotel, and the taste is quite satisfactory to me. The coconut chicken hot pot is very tasty and the price is not expensive. When you check in, tell me if you can still enjoy a discount if you join a member, and also give a special welcome fruit for members. The caring service is enthusiastic. I am very grateful and lucky to have met such a responsible butler on this trip. It is amazing. Finally, let me say that there is a grandma in the hotel lobby who has made some animated characters by hand. It is very vivid and beautiful.

The statues in the lobby are also luxurious. Hotels are doing well now. There are also free nucleic acid testing sites. The service is super near first class. Helped solve a lot of things. The hotel has a gym. Although it is not bigger than the one outside, there are few people left and the equipment is relatively complete. I can exercise and swim. I feel that I will become a landscape after taking a few nights off at the crown, hahaha. What I have to say is the hotel's swimming pool. Maybe due to special reasons, there are few people, but it also meets the real needs of many guests, that is, fewer people have fun. The swimming pool is also very large, children and adults are separated, which can give guests a perfect experience, and if you don't like swimming, you can lie on the loungers provided by the swimming pool, bask in the sun, or you can go to the seaside. The hotel is only one road away from the seaside, which is uniquely endowed by nature , and the sea here is still quiet, there is not a lot of noise, you can enjoy it quietly and listen to the sound of the waves.
Hygiene: The hotel has its own garden, the park is clean, the room has no peculiar smell, the corridor has a fragrance, the bedding and bath towels also meet my requirements, and the hotel rooms are equipped with disinfectant wipes. The disposable disinfectant that can be seen everywhere provides a safe place for guests, the dinner is more abundant, the breakfast variety is also more varied, the restaurant service girl is also better, providing baby chairs and dinner plates for our children. Chinese dishes can satisfy the taste of the public, and the local characteristics are also strong.
Environment: The interior and exterior of the hotel are good. nice environment. There are also many scenic spots nearby, which are not very far away. You can see the West Island from the room. I heard from the guy at the front desk that there are some rooms where you can see Nanshan Temple. Each room in the hotel has its own characteristics. You can watch the sunrise and the sunset. Looking at the sea and the swimming pool, I sincerely thank everyone in the hotel for their careful arrangements.
Service: Nancy and eason service at the front desk are very considerate. Help with the arrangement and detail. Follow up the whole experience of the stay. And the eldest sister in the hotel room is also nice. After a few days off, they will smile and say hello. The room helped to arrange the welcome layout, and the animals were folded with towels, which the children liked very much. Next time I have the opportunity, I will come again to experience the super service.

msg:Another very unforgettable and pleasant trip to Sanya. I came here at the same time last year. After the National Day, I chose Sanya to travel again, which perfectly avoided the peak period. The day before I arrived in Sanya, I received a call from the hotel service butler, asking me Arrival time, preference for big double bed and preference for stay, patiently explained to me the epidemic check-in policy, and informed me of the weather and temperature in Sanya in advance to prepare me. After arriving in Sanya, I went straight to the hotel. I missed the sea after a year of absence. After arriving at the hotel lobby, a service staff helped to open the door, take the luggage, and guide me to the counter to check in. The lobby of the hotel is very a**ospheric, with European architectural style, as if to the palace. The lady at the front desk warmly greeted me and informed me that the room had been arranged in advance. Since I am also a member of InterContinental, this time she helped me apply for an upgrade to the supreme sea view room. The whole check-in explanation was very detailed, and the lady at the front desk patiently introduced me It's great to see the attractions and delicious restaurants around the hotel. The room is a sea view room with a side view of the sea. The floors are arranged very high, and the view is what I expected. Two Starbucks coffee vouchers are presented. After purchasing and exchanging at the hotel lobby bar, you can sit in the outfield watching the sea view, the sea breeze, listening to the sound of the waves and drinking coffee~ The hotel is very close to the Tianya Haijiao scenic spot, and there are also West Island and Nanshan Temple scenic spots nearby. , We stayed for two days and visited these attractions. One thing I have to mention is that the hotel can also do nucleic acid every day, which is quite convenient for our tourists. During the stay, the eldest sister in the guest room will clean up the room every day, and the things placed on the sink in the bathroom will be neatly arranged, which is really considerate. There are too few Hainanese specialties for breakfast, and I hope to increase it. Thanks again to the staff of Crowne Plaza Sanya Bay, I will definitely choose to stay again next year.

msg:I was only preparing for the first night, and I didn't have too many requirements, but this hotel really surprised me. First of all, let's talk about the location of the hotel. The hotel is located on Sanyawan Road, only one road away from the seaside, well-deserved sea view hotel. The scenery along Sanya Bay Road goes west all the way. The hotel is located five kilometers away from the West Island. The front and rear scenic spots are very convenient, and there are buses 🚌 can go directly to the big and small caves, and the room can also see the Guanyin of Nanshan Temple in the distance. Nanshan Temple can be reached in only ten minutes by car. The End of the World, which is a must-check in Sanya, is also very close. If you want to travel to the ends of the earth with your boyfriend and girlfriend, you can give priority to it. The second is in terms of food. Although it is not as prosperous and diverse as the urban area, you must come to Sanya to experience local specialties. There is a small town near the hotel. It can be said that there are all kinds of local noodle soups in Hainan. The famous Lingshui sour powder. Of course, you can also go to eat hot pot barbecue and other. The third is the service that is especially valued when traveling. A hotel service is really a first impression. When you arrive at the door of the hotel, the security will strictly check a series of certificates. When you come up to the lobby, there is a tall and handsome concierge to help open the door, greet and take luggage. Then the little brother Eason at the front desk was very warmly received and checked in quickly. It can be seen that he is very professional and experienced. He can check in quickly without delaying the guests' time, and can introduce the hotel's large and small facilities and restaurants in place. It can only be described as professional and handsome. Brother Eason was very considerate to help arrange the room, I was really surprised (because I was transitioning for one night and did not book a room) and helped to upgrade to a very nice room with sea view. It's so cool to see the sea. With the invincible sea view and the balcony bathtub, I think I can take a bath for a day [covering my face]. And the room is clean, although the hotel has a long time, but the warranty is not bad, the room has a fragrant smell. Finally, the breakfast I went to experience the next day. To be honest, the taste and variety were excellent. This is the second hotel so far that can meet my requirements so perfectly. It can be seen that the quality and service concept of hotel management and ordinary staff are outstanding. Such a hotel should allow more people to experience it. This temporary transition can experience such a good service. Next time, I will definitely stay for a few days to experience the beautiful Sanya Bay, as well as the Crowne Plaza transcendental service. like

During the epidemic, the hotel will considerately arrange free nucleic acid testing for tourists every day, just go downstairs. make nucleic acids. At the moment of the epidemic, there are very few hotel staff, but the service is still very good. The staff at the front desk will intimately introduce the surrounding travel strategies, and add WeChat to ask them questions at any time, which makes us feel very warm.

Both the facilities and services are very thoughtful, and the front desk staff is also very enthusiastic, and took the initiative to upgrade the room type for us, allowing us to live in the supreme sea view room. The cleaning aunt of the hotel is also very careful. Before we went to eat, we ordered the room to be cleaned. After we came back, the room was completely new. The most satisfying thing about the hotel is that you can take a bath and watch the sea from the balcony. You can also walk directly to the opposite beach when you go downstairs. It is very close. The seaside scenery is really beautiful.

We cleaned up the sand immediately, very considerate. The children's swimming pool is not big, but it is enough for children to play in the water. The only disadvantage this time is that the hotel's swimming pool is under maintenance, so I originally wanted to live in the pool room on the first floor, but I couldn't. Although I upgraded to a sea view room, the scenery is perfect , but I didn't get to play "Push open the balcony door is the swimming pool", there is still a little regret, the meal is a little expensive, no fault, after all, Sanya is a tourist city, it is still acceptable.

msg:When Shanghai was unblocked, I immediately decided to go to Sanya. Since I landed in the early morning, I called and contacted some hotels in Sanya Bay, Yalong Bay and Haitang Bay in advance. The Sanya Bay Crown left a very deep impression on me and answered any questions I asked patiently. , the head of the guest service called for further explanation, so he decided to choose the Crowne Plaza Sanya Bay international brand chain. After the check-in experience, it turned out to be a very smart move. First of all, before check-in, the hotel will have a guest service staff call in advance to confirm the relevant details and preferences, and ask for consent to add WeChat, which is convenient to provide various services more quickly and efficiently. The services are very comprehensive and careful, although I arrive very late , but the guest attendant Wu Hainan still asked me on WeChat the first time I landed whether I was satisfied with the room arrangement, whether I needed other assistance, and asked about the breakfast meal time. Many thanks to Manager Wu Hainan for arranging the room that I am very satisfied with. Arriving at the hotel concierge and front desk staff are also very prompt, patient and enthusiastic. After a quick check-in, the concierge escorted to the room and explained the details of the hotel, so the service is really full of full marks. Staying at the first-line sea view hotel in Sanya Bay, the hotel style belongs to the European Rococo style, and the tones are all light colors, so the facilities and equipment are a little old, but its style is really unique in Sanya, different from most Chinese-style hotels . The room is spacious and comfortable, the balcony has a bathtub, and it is very beautiful to go to the beach at night to watch the sunset. The hotel swimming pool has a reasonable layout. Although it is not mainly for parents and children, the swimming pool is also enough for children to play, and the overall is very comfortable. The breakfast is rich in variety, but I hope that some dishes with Hainan characteristics can be eaten more, and some dishes can taste better. At the same time, the chef's attitude is hoped to be better. During peak hours, the table is cleaned and the service is timely. There are more novice hotel waiters , the standard implementation is not very consistent, the breakfast and the corridor cleaning staff are very polite. The most important thing in the hotel is service. The facilities and equipment will be old, but the service can never be neglected. The service of the old hotel should be more important, but the service needs enough manpower. Therefore, it is recommended that the management should supplement the grass-roots waiters in time, and will try their best to colleagues and friends in the future. Recommended, I hope the hotel will get better and better! ! !

In terms of hardware facilities, the price is right, so it is a very cost-effective hotel. At the same time, the hotel has indeed done a lot of homework in other areas. Although the hardware facilities are not comparable to the new hotels in Haitang Bay, the service of this hotel is indeed very comfortable and considerate. The consultation call that came, asked us enthusiastically about our housing needs and preferences, learned that we wanted a room on a higher floor, and tried to help us with a free upgrade, which made us full of expectations before we set off, and After learning that we have 2 babies, I offered to help add a baby cot and a large bed fence. As soon as I entered the bedroom, I found that Dabao's bathrobe, children's wash bag and slippers were also prepared, which made our trip. Off to a very good start. The hotel belongs to European style. Although there is no air conditioning in the hotel lobby, the cool sea breeze blowing through the transparent lobby is still very natural and comfortable. When we checked in at the front desk, the butler took the initiative to add our WeChat account, which made our stay in the hotel a lot more convenient. If you have any questions that need to be consulted or need to be solved, you can directly ask on WeChat, and the response speed is very fast and solved. The efficiency is also very high, which saves us the time to roam around like headless flies. The hotel has a children's swimming pool, bubble games every afternoon, as well as a children's playground and some doll game machines, which saves us a lot of trouble. After all, we are mainly for leisure when we go out on vacation. Lying on the bed with the air conditioner and looking at the sea is the most comfortable vacation I feel, but I don’t want to go out to sunbathe with my children every day. Children with these toys can stay in the hotel for a day, which prevents us from going out and basking in the sun. tragedy. In short, I am very satisfied with this trip. Among the hotels I have stayed in for so many years, the service of this hotel is the only hotel that warms my heart. I will choose this hotel when I have the opportunity to play in Sanya in the future.

msg:A super satisfactory hotel, originally just an airport transition hotel, did not report much expectations. Arrived in the middle of the night with the baby, and there were some problems. The front desk Xiao Zhou has been helping to contact and coordinate solutions. The next day, he helped to modify the order and changed it to a breakfast-included package. The whole process was patient and meticulous, and gave us a lot of help. Highly recommended, if possible I want to give the six-star 🌟 children a lot of fun. When we leave, we will pay back the drink rolls and wait for the bus there. I will come again next time, and I will recommend friends to stay.

The room area is quite large, the bathtub is very good, you can buy one or take a bath ball to take a bath. The bathtub is on the balcony, and the balcony has a curtain that can be pulled down. The rooms are two buildings with the lobby as the central axis, so it is a pity that most of the rooms cannot face the sea. Looking at the connecting pool on the next floor, it feels great too!
The swimming pool is quite big. I saw that the swimming pools in the woods have stopped. I don't know if there are too many leaves or something, or there are not enough people recently.
There is a bubble machine in the afternoon, but I didn't pay attention to what time it is. It is open until 10:30 in the evening. There are not many people on the Dragon Boat Festival night.
The breakfast is pretty good~ It would be even better if the powder can be adjusted, because I am not very good at mixing
After checking in, there will be a housekeeper who will take him to the room, which is good. Our housekeeper is Xiao Lu, who is cute and lovely. If you need to do nucleic acid or something, just ask her. The luggage brought by the housekeeper Li was also brought up by her.
Ivy, the room supervisor, is helping out in the guest room. The person is also very nice, and the room is done just fine. If you need help, it is very timely.
There is a road from the back to the beach, which is really convenient! ! It's a pity that the sunrise in Sanya Bay is not very good.
If you go to eat around, it seems that there are only many shops in this area that can be picked up for free. I think it is very good! You can call for a car in the store to pick you up

When leaving the store, Zhu Youyan, the manager of the customer service floor, also came over to greet the check-in experience in person. This detail is really not available in many Crowne Plazas.
As an old user of Ctrip for many years, the trea**ent given by Ctrip is no less than that of InterContinental members. All-inclusive breakfast, lunch, dinner, and entertainment can be completed in this hotel. Students who like to stay in hotels must come once! In short, aiming for 10 points, I give 9.9 points, and the remaining 0.1 is because I am afraid that they are too proud hhh.

The first-line sea view experience is not too good. In general, it is very good. I will stay here next time I come. It is highly recommended. I regret that I didn't set an executive room. The price in May is very cost-effective.
The south gate of the hotel was originally the sea, which was supposed to be very convenient, but the south gate was closed during the epidemic, so it took 5 minutes to walk around the north gate. During the epidemic, the restaurant was not open, and the 50 yuan meal coupon was nowhere to be used...

How to say it, as far as the service is concerned, this is also the most basic, but the service of this shop is really exerted to the extreme, and the customer is really God. On the day of check-in, Eason's housekeeper helped a lot, and the telephone consultation was also very patient. The parent-child and children's section of the hotel is also well done, and there are basically everything that should be there. The swimming pool is also an outdoor room temperature swimming pool, but it is rainy season in Sanya these days, so you may not be able to enjoy the swimming pool, but this regret can be made up for with the baroque bathtub in the room, which is completely facing the sea. It's very romantic, and the facilities and equipment are relatively new. After all, a hotel that has been open for a long time, it is very good to do this. All in all, it was a very satisfying trip, and I will come again if I have the chance.

The overall service can still keep up, and I did not encounter any problems during the stay. Moreover, the roads of the hotel are the seaside. If the hotel still has its own bus station when the lockdown is lifted, it is also very convenient to go to some scenic spots, and they are all direct. The swimming pool of the hotel is still open. Because there are few people, the guests can play freely. The breakfast is still very fresh. I especially like to eat pancakes. The hotel's bathtub, indeed, is unparalleled in beauty, and the room can take a bath and enjoy the sea view. All in all, this hotel is a treasure hotel worth staying in. It can fully meet the needs of tourists who are simply on vacation. The hotel staff is also very warm and caring

After tossing around, I chose this hotel. The hotel lobby is very spacious and cool, and the check-in speed is also very fast. There was a housekeeper who introduced the hotel's internal facilities and the opening hours of the restaurant in detail. Eason learned that I would continue to stay for a few more days, and very warmly invited me to experience the hotel's breakfast, so that I could compare whether the subsequent orders included breakfast, the hotel room The whole thing is okay, and the sight is very clean, but I have a small suggestion: the door lock of the hotel room should really be replaced, other hotels may be more inductive, and sometimes it takes a few times to insert the card to open. But overall, the hotel's facilities are very complete, the sea view effect is also great, and the service is more in place than other hotels. Thank you Eason for your patient service and introduction. The hotel's breakfast is very good, with a variety of varieties, and the restaurant staff are also very attentive.

msg:This time, the family is out to play, and they also bring their children, so it is particularly important to choose a hotel. It depends not only on the cost-effectiveness, but also on the one that is suitable for parents and children. I have stayed in many other hotels, big and small. My first impression of this hotel was romance. Why it is romantic? First: The lobby of the hotel is a Western-style statue that directly touches the senses, and Chinese elements (fans) are added to the roof. The sea breeze blows in, and the pictures on the fans make the statues lifelike; second: Every hotel room The guest rooms all have independent balcony bathtubs, especially since there are not many tourists in Sanya now, you can see the entire coastline of Sanya Bay and the style of West Island in the distance, and watch the sunset while taking a bath. 3: The facilities of the hotel (when I checked in, I specifically asked about the opening time of the Eason Little Brother Hotel.) Although it is not very new, it can be seen that the maintenance of all aspects of the hotel is also very attentive. Why is the facility very romantic. Maybe I also put the architectural style together. The hotel has a V-shaped building as a whole. There is a room with a view of the swimming pool. You can enjoy the scenery in the distance. In the end, the most important thing is the service of the hotel. This hotel will help you think of everything you need from entering the door, checking in, entering the room, and everything you need. Our check-in reception is Eason In terms of reception, he completely puts the customer above and thinks what the customer thinks. I was just wondering how a boy could be so careful. When he saw you with a baby, he would notify in advance to add a fence to the room and inform the children of the toiletries. Moreover, we booked two rooms this time, one room does not include breakfast, the three of us Personally, there will be one person who can’t eat breakfast and can only be forced to order takeaway. Eason later told me that although the hotel’s business is not very good due to the epidemic, it still applied for one-person breakfast for me because it wanted us to have a perfect experience, no As for regret. Finally I want to say that the Crown Hotel really puts the customer at heart and first.

Supervisor Vincent should be a special recruit. Why do you say that? I think Crowne Plaza should select constellations to recruit people, so it is especially suitable for customer service and customer relation's maintainence. Be considerate and not pretentious! Two words: comfortable. Everything from bedding to food is well arranged. Not only himself, but Carlson and Eason at the front desk are also responsive, and the problem should be solved without ambiguity.
A lot of five-star, high-end stand in a row, and it is not enough to fight for hardware, what is more needed should be such a sense of service.

It must be beautiful. The hotel facilities are relatively newly maintained in a hotel in Sanya Bay, and the lobby is very beautifully maintained. The location is also ideal, and it can be used as an ideal hotel for just landing in Sanya to visit the scenic spot of West Island. And the transportation is also in all directions. You can take the 25/26 bus to Xidao, the ends of the earth, the big and small Tongtian, Nanshan Temple, and there is a bus stop at the back of the hotel. guests. Entertainment in a hotel is also great, gym, chess and card room, tennis, billiards, table tennis, children's playground, what is more worth mentioning is the hotel's series of amu*****t parks, claw machines and video games are really super invincible and give you a childhood , I think I can play electric games all day in the hotel, haha. There is also the one-stop service of the hotel butler, who completely overwhelmed other hotels and checked me in. Eason is handsome and caring. Like a tour guide, he introduced the hotel completely and told us how to go to the beach. Recently, in order to ensure the safety of the children's sleep, we also prepared a bed fence for us. I really think about what customers think. In short, although this trip to Sanya is a bit regrettable because of the epidemic, Eason warmed our family with his service. Thank you very much.

The water in the bay was not as fast as Haitang Bay. Adhering to Intercontinental's high-level customer relationship manager Huang Bin, I was deeply impressed. Sunshine, handsome, and very proactive in helping me solve various problems. Whether it's a child who catches a cold and asks the restaurant to send two ginger soups or I need a meeting to help me urgently arrange a quiet meeting. From the meeting in the conference room to the end, I personally escorted us to the car and left. I was very attentive to serve us, making us feel at home.

msg:The appearance of the hotel is grand and the rooms are old and damaged. I feel that the operators did not run the hotel carefully, so that the waiters were lazy. The cleaning of the rooms was seriously unqualified. There are many, many, many sanitary corners. The rooms are damp and musty. The customer service phone was called twice before it was delivered. The waiter who was equipped with a dehumidifier actually gave me a bottle of air purifier. I feel that this hotel is specially designed for elderly tour groups. The funnier thing is that I think the room is very humid and ask the hotel if there is another hotel Chinese restaurant. The coconut chicken hot pot with crab sticks, beef balls and beef rolls is very strange besides the chicken. It seems that the color of the food has been left for a long time. It is worth mentioning that the 25 yuan coconut in the hotel vending machine is delicious. The location is not particularly good. The edge of the coconut dream promenade is near the airport, so it is far from the urban seafood market. I didn't eat breakfast, so I won't make a comment. I bought a package for two days at 1588. To be honest, I don't know. Why is the rating of this hotel quite high? I think that if the one-day room rate exceeds 300, I will not consider it. It is on the same level as Vienna.

No matter the service, room type, and breakfast are all satisfied, especially the service is impeccable. The four-person large suite booked has first-class sea views, and it is really big enough to live in very comfortably. This time coincided with my mother’s birthday, the hotel intimately arranged happy birthday bed decorations, which made my mother very happy 👍🏻; the hotel went out to the Coconut Dream Corridor, which was a great location to watch the sunset; the four-person suite was also given away every afternoon Tea and evening lounge buffet; I ordered the set menu of the hotel’s Shanhailou Chinese restaurant for a few days, and the taste is also very good; although the hotel is a bit old, it is well maintained, and it feels like a medieval castle; Still mention the service again, all aspects are very caring, from the front desk to the cleaning staff are very enthusiastic. If I recommend a hotel in Sanya Bay, I would recommend it here.

I saw this in Sanya Bay, the only one with a pool house, I was very satisfied! The little brother Carlson of Check-in is very handsome and gentle, and very caring, helping our guests solve problems and provide convenience! The hotel afternoon tea set looks good, and the hotel restaurant Shanhailou for dinner is also very delicious. It is eaten by the pilots and flight attendants! Room service is good.

I felt the a**osphere of the hotel and the environment was very good when I entered the hotel. Except that the traffic is not very convenient, and the location is not in the city center, other things are very good, so we rent a car, which is quite convenient. This hotel is very large, with its own swimming pool, garden, and the seaside across a road. The room is also a sea-view room with a wide view. I like it very much. After staying for four nights, I have feelings and I am reluctant to leave, haha come again next time.

msg:The experience of staying in is very nice, the front desk upgraded me to the Supreme Ocean View Room in advance, the experience is good, the stay is quiet, the bedding is hygienic in all aspects, giving people a very relaxed and comfortable feeling. The free breakfast tastes very good, that is, there is no reminder for lunch and dinner, and I missed the lunch time. When we went almost at 2:30 noon the day before yesterday, the waiter told us that we had stopped eating. Finally waited until the evening to eat with a great sense of anticipation, and found that there were only three choices for dinner, and the taste was quite discounted. The chicken in the small portion and ordered set c was completely cooked and then fried. This is a flaw .
My little suggestion is that since it is a check-in package, it should ensure the standard of hotel dining and should not fool customers. Even if the price is slightly higher, the quality of the meal must be guaranteed. To be honest, because the hotel is too far from the city, the only thing that can keep customers' hearts is often multi-faceted (eat and stay). Personally suggest that the meal coupons in the package can make a small card and put it in each room to remind guests to eat Time, and improve the quality of catering.
But for the hotel room, there is no doubt that the bathtub can be used as a background, and the net celebrities can check in.
Finally, the hotel’s housekeeper, Doris, called today to ask about the experience of the stay, collect feedback and send small gifts to my home, which is very considerate. Hope Crowne Plaza Resort will not forget its original intention and get better and better!

Finally, I especially recommend the bathtub on the balcony. It is super cool and has a great view. The design of the bathtub fits the human body. The key is relatively large.

The hotel is very close to the airport, about 10 minutes by taxi. As soon as we arrived at the hotel, the bellman eagerly helped with the luggage and took us to check in. The lobby is very beautiful, European-style buildings, Poseidon statues and European-style glass window grilles give this hotel by the sea a touch of exoticism. I chose a room facing the sea, and on the opposite side is a small island. There is also a lighthouse in the distance. In the evening, watching the sunset on the sun loungers on the balcony is very pleasant. Although the room faces the sea, it is not very humid. The hotel has Starbucks service, the unexpected delight of coffee star people. For dinner, I chose the hotel’s seafood buffet, with many types, including seafood, barbecue, and small hot pot. Crowne Plaza’s service attitude makes people feel comfortable and caring. Whether it’s checking in or dining, or even meeting the service aunt in the guest room, the staff greeted them warmly. Next time I have a chance, I will use this place as the first stop of a trip to Sanya with my friends.

The guest room has also been upgraded to a sea-view room on a higher floor. It’s great that you can take a bath in the room and watch the sunset in the evening.

There are rainy days during the stay, but there is no anti-skid trea**ent and no signs on the steps leading to the hotel’s garden and swimming pool. Hotel hot and cold water adjus**ent is sometimes not sensitive. Generally speaking, it is a good place to stay in Sanya just after landing and the last day of the return journey.

msg:Because I wanted to see the beautiful sunset, I chose Sanya Bay. As an intercontinental gold member, I chose Crowne Plaza Sanya Bay.

I moved here from Yalong Bay Jinmao Hilton, and there was indeed a gap when I first entered the hotel. I booked an executive sea-view room. The guy who checked in at the front desk was very helpful. Since the previous hotel did not log out the ID card, he could not re-enter the ID. He kindly asked me to go back to my room to rest first, and then come down to handle it later.

I was not satisfied with the room I was initially given, a strong musty smell came in as soon as I entered, and the air conditioner was broken. Later, after responding like the front desk, I adjusted one for me. The air conditioner is OK, but it still smells of musty. After receiving my feedback, the customer service manager Xiao Wu (Wu Hainan) contacted me and helped me upgrade the sea view suite. This time the air-conditioning and musty problems have been solved. The service is really amazing! ! ! And this room type is really recommended, with a large balcony and panoramic sea views of Sanya Bay!

🍃Environment: 1. The decoration of the hotel is retro, somewhat old
                 2. The hotel does not have its own beach, but it is very close to the beach, just across a small road, and I think the beach in Bialong Bay is better.
                 3. The hotel is not very bright, maybe it is the decoration design style
🧹Hygienic: There is a musty smell in some houses
🚗 Transportation: It is very close to the airport, 10 minutes by car, if you catch the early flight, it is very suitable to live here. Parking is free.
🤖Facilities: The air conditioning in some rooms is broken
🍚Meals: 1. Chinese restaurant: The set menu is very affordable and tastes good, it is recommended
               2. Ordering in the room: The French fries in the baby set meal actually contain chili noodles, which is incomprehensible. Hope to improve.
               3. Afternoon tea in the executive lounge, the taste is really good. It's much better than Hilton's.
❤️Children: The indoor children's playground is really bad, too small, and very shabby. Hope to improve. The outdoor slide is not bad. On the whole, children can't play much. Sand dredging tools are used casually, which is good.

In terms of staying experience and comfort, the price-quality ratio of this hotel is still very high. After all, at this price, you may not be able to live in a regular room at the Linhai Hotel in Yalong Bay or Haitang Bay.

Convenient transportation to nearby attractions: Big and small Dongtian, Nanshan, Tianya Haijiao can be reached by bus! Let me spit it out: the balcony of the Supreme King Room is not facing the sea. The large round bathtub on the balcony is just a decoration. It faces the balcony of the hotel next to the room, and it will be exposed when used!

In terms of it, I am very satisfied, whether it is the room arrangement or the hotel staff. I was very impressed. I also thank the housekeeper Eason for contacting us in advance to arrange the room. My husband also said that the service in this hotel is better than others. My child likes the toys provided by the hotel. In the future, Sanya will still choose the crown, which is trustworthy.
🚗 Transportation: super convenient
🧹Hygienic: Everything I see is very clean, and the things used by the children are also disinfected in the hotel
🍃Environment: I think the environment is not worse than other bays, each has its own characteristics
🔔Service: The service is really good, better than most hotels.

The scenery was good and the view was quiet and did not disturb the solid wall. Comfortable and aesthetically dignified a**osphere haha~ Because I don’t want to be tired from the leisure trip, the room is good and I decided to live here for the next 2 nights. That’s right, I don’t want to stay close to driving for three nights. In fact, I will change my mind when I meet a comfortable and satisfying accommodation during the trip. ～ The front desk told me that the small refrigerator could be emptied. The next day, the room service and the front desk service were very good. The hotel is a comfortable home during this trip. The swimming pool, tennis court and Thai SPA have not been played yet. I hope I can still take it out today. Time to experience. Special thanks to Amy in the front hall. Thank you for your hard work and dedication. A pleasant trip will also recommend to friends around you.

msg:As the first stop in Sanya, we considered for a long time and decided to choose Crowne Plaza Sanya Bay. After staying here for two days, I would like to express my feelings about staying. I hope to help the friends who want to book next.
1: The location of the hotel is superior and the transportation is very convenient. It is very close to the End of the World, Nanshan Temple, Big and Small Caves, and West Island. Basically, you can choose this hotel for the first or last stop of Sanya. It is the perfect time to visit a scenic spot a day or go out to sea for a day. 2: Hotel facilities or family parent-child activities are also available. The swimming pools are also divided into sizes. I think you can choose to stay in their pool room next time. Thinking about waking up every morning, you can go swimming directly. It is invincible, and Their family has a seafood barbecue BBQ buffet every night. If you are tired and worried about being slaughtered every day, it is better to return to the hotel to have a buffet. It is full and cheap, and the hotel also has other restaurants. Meet the requirements of guests from other places. 3: I think the hotel room is still very beautiful, the overall appearance of the hotel gives people a very grand and luxurious feeling, and the room can directly see the opposite West Island from the sea. I asked the front desk brother to take me to see other Room, some rooms can also see Nanshan Temple, and the room will turn on the air-conditioning before moving in, which is really super sweet. 4: The last point is that the service of this hotel is indeed much better than other hotels I have stayed in. On the day of check-in, Eason, their butler, happened to check in for me. The room arranged for us was very suitable, and Eason's brother was also added. Wechat, after chatting for a few words, it feels like we two have known each other for many years. The other services of the hotel are also excellent. The eldest sister in the guest room asks whether she needs to put a few more bottles of water or if she needs to clean the room. After ordering the room, I feel that their chefs are also very good. My brother likes to eat and feels like the hotel. Everyone attaches great importance to guests and will greet them when they meet. It is indeed a satisfying trip here.

Because of the time arrangement, the afternoon tea and cocktail party provided by the hotel were not all enjoyable, which is a pity.
The overall area of the room is quite large and it is more comfortable to live in. The only thing that is not so good is that the room smells a bit damp, probably because it is close to the sea and the hotel is not very new.
The first day of stay was relatively late, so the swimming pool was only available the next day. There were bubble machines and music on that day. So my friends like it very much.
There are several restaurants in the hotel, but the taste is average, not very memorable. The main reason is that Crowne Plaza Sanya Bay is the first stop to Sanya, so there is not too much time to find and try other nearby hotels.

msg:The hotel was a bit disappointed. When I first booked, I saw that it was renovated in 2018 and thought it was a new hotel, but after checking in, I found that the hotel facilities are very old and the decoration style seems to be from the last century. The actual situation of the hotel room does not match the Ctrip photos. It is estimated that the photos have been deliberately done later. Moreover, the sanitary condition of the hotel is also disappointing. There are rubbish and dust in the gaps of the sliding door of the bathroom. There is a musty smell in the room, and there is also a faint smell in the toilet. No five-star hotel should have a fresh fragrance. Of course, it can not be said that it has not been cleaned and it can only be said that the hotel is old and serious. The hot water in the shower room is hot and cold, and it should be caused by the aging of the pipe. The swimming pool in the pool house is a highlight. The children love it and have a good time. The hotel’s afternoon tea, Starbucks and breakfast are also good, but it’s a pity that the afternoon tea place is a fully enclosed space a bit boring. There are big seafood celebrities for breakfast, which seems to be a waste. The hotel provides a free bus to the airport, but I don’t know why the next bus after 6:00 in the morning actually takes 10 o’clock, which is too long. The hotel restaurant, Shanhailou, is very cost-effective. I ordered a set meal of 258. The steamed fish was very large. Our child had been playing around during meals. The waiter Alisa was very warm and patient. Thanks for her service.

msg:I had expectations for this hotel from the beginning! Thinking that the hotels under the InterContinental Group should be okay! It turned out to be a mess. We were a family of four and stayed at the Wyndham Sanya Bay Lihe Hotel for three nights. I gave a rating of 4.5, which was basically satisfactory. As a result, the so-called Crown Hotel was a mess. People’s family suite, we took a taxi from Wyndham on the first day of staying! The front desk said it was upgrading our room to a small suite! The so-called four-person suite is 2 beds, one of which is a bit bigger, and the room is on the 6th floor. As a result, we were all dumbfounded after entering! It's tattered and has a damp smell! It's really not as good as my country mother-in-law's private house. I wanted to check out at that time! But the family is tired! I think I can't bear it all night! As a result, when my dad took a bath at night, because the hot water from the sprinkler was hot and cold, my dad burned his head when he washed it! So I got angry! I came to Sanya to relax, but my family members were still burned! Fortunately, it's not too powerful, my dad has thick skin! I called Ctrip! Because it was ordered on Ctrip! I said I wanted to retreat to Wyndham tomorrow for the next two nights! Ctrip said to negotiate with the hotel! Finally gave me an answer saying that I can't get back! I said my family was scalded in the bath! The shower for bathing cannot be adjusted at all, either cold water or hot water. By the way, let me tell you that the room is 601! Remember to remember! Then my husband got angry too! I took my mobile phone and the staff of Ctrip reported! Even if you spend more than 1,300 yuan a day in such a broken room, the things inside are still broken and smelly. If you can't live in it, I also booked a suite by Wyndham for only 1,100 yuan a day! Ctrip said to continue to communicate with the hotel. In the end, the hotel called me and said it was changing my suite to the 6th floor. It turned out to be a bigger one, with a better view and a view of the sea. Smelly! Since we can't retreat, we can only bite the bullet and stay! In the back hotel, I added a small bed for my son for free! Stay a little more stable for the next two nights! The only hotel that comforts me has a nice sea view! Living in my broken room, you can see a 180 degree sea view! 2 points for the sea view! In addition, the hotel’s breakfast is okay to eat! We are intercontinental members, and we can sit in the VIP room for breakfast! This is fine, very quiet! Others are really useless except for the larger lobby! The hotel pool is dirty! My son went swimming and encountered insects and leaves in the water! In short, I still do not recommend everyone to go to this hotel! Yesterday the hotel staff called me to come to life and asked me for a 5-star review! Saying five-star praise can help us check out tomorrow until three o'clock in the afternoon! As a result, when we checked out today, we kept calling from 1 o'clock to 2 o'clock and kept urging us away! Really angry! To be honest, I really won't give them any five-star praise, whether they give late check-out or not! I'm telling the truth! It's incomparable to staying at Wyndham for the first three nights! The key Wyndham is cheaper than them! Highly recommend everyone to live in Wyndham!

There are free towels and mineral water at all the water places, swimming laps, and children’s sand tools are all free to play (evil Long Bay Hilton charges), the breakfast is super rich, the fruits are fresh and fresh, there is also artificial coffee, the sea water, the beach are much better than Long Bay, the children are very happy to play, I must go to Sanya again for this hotel

環境：大廳相當的大氣，就是木有空調，現在的三亞是真的熱啊！早餐廳我們去得早空調也沒完全打起來。但是！電梯還有房間的空調是非常足的！
服務：這就必須大大的點讚了呀！給我們的客房管家小胡大大的點讚我們本來計劃4點多的飛機回上海，早上下雨導致飛機延誤到晚上7點多，一開始延遲退房到2點的，我跟小胡溝通了一下情況，給我們延遲到4點退房了，因為我們帶着小朋友，如果太早到機場真的會很麻煩，延遲到4點退房，小朋友舒舒服服的睡了個午覺。
酒店有租借水槍，電動浮板，非常方便以及人性化，離機場也很近，去西島和南山也很方便。

msg:淡季去三亞，性價比還是很高的。假期比較短，又要去熱門景點，所以選擇在三亞灣找個酒店。網上一頓比較，選擇了皇冠假日。位置很棒，與海邊衹隔了一條馬路，離南山景區和機場都很近，大小洞天、海上觀音、西島、天涯海角可以順路遊玩。酒店可以提供免費的接送機、景區班車的。
        酒店是歐式巴洛克風格，特別是酒店佈局和大廳，即使在現在，依然大氣漂亮。酒店設施很完善，游泳池、健身房、電玩區什麼的都有。
        特點表揚一下酒店的管家服務，跟我對接的是管家小蒙，提前就聯繫我，諮詢我的行程及入住習慣及要求，很貼心的幫我提前預約了接機服務，入住的時候提供了水果，還順便幫忙預約了行程班車，在我的要求下，給了遊玩的建議和特色小吃。説實話，小蒙的熱情及推薦，讓我這次三亞之旅真的是全程無憂，重點表揚一下。
        我選擇的是高樓層觀海大床房，陽台上還有個浴盆，泡澡觀海妥妥的一個不吱聲啊。
        這個價位，這個環境，真的是性價比超高了，如果不是以購物為主的話，皇冠假日絕對不二選擇，當然了，如果不差錢的話，可以隨心所欲了。

msg:酒店管家小何人很好，專業且熱情。辦理入住後發現房間內有一道通向隔壁房間的門，雖然鎖上的，但個人比較介意，畢竟是女生入住，也不知道前台是怎麼想的。還好管家積極幫忙調換了房間，還按照我們的時間給送了歡迎水果，很貼心。
酒店房價在不同平台差價較大，攜程上預訂的無早餐房間比另一平台帶兩早的房間還貴。攜程瞭解到情況後積極與酒店協商，管家也幫忙同酒店溝通，希望可以補兩日早餐，差價可以不退，但是酒店均未同意。之前來三亞入住過假日酒店，在辦理入住時酒店發現我們少一人早餐，主動幫我們加了一人早餐，當時感覺非常貼心，所以印象很深刻。這次預訂太匆忙，誤以為是同一家酒店，到了後才知道不對。好在酒店管家人還不錯，最後攜程也以紅包的形式補償了一日早餐，也算有些誠意吧。
PS：酒店送的清補涼味道很好，手工曲奇餅也還不錯。衹是酒店對面的海灘一般，可以乘坐公交車去椰夢長廊，那邊海灘小螃蟹很多，我們還抓到了一衹海星。

環境：交通方便，靠近海邊，有大泳池但不是恆温。房間淡季750左右豪華海景房含早餐。房間有一股發黴的味道，應該是海風潮濕無人入住時沒有開窗通風導致的，感覺海邊都是難免的。
衞生：挺乾淨的。
服務：正常五星級酒店的服務
食堂味道不錯，菜品豐富，還偶爾有人偶穿卡通服裝逗小朋友，挺好的。提供行李免費寄存服務，不用擔心退房後還想出行但不好拿行李的問題，總體來説物有所值。酒店距離西島、天涯海角3,4個公交站，很近。酒店後門就有公交站，很方便。酒店靠近南山寺、大小洞天，距離20公里左右，送南山寺直通車，乘車半小時左右到南山寺。適合剛到三亞時入住。圖1為酒店陽台的海景，圖二圖三與酒店無關，湊圖用。其他更多圖文詳情直接搜**，很多視頻介紹有。管家AMY服務態度好，提前聯繫，得知情侶入住，在床上放了兩衹毛巾天鵝，灑了玫瑰花瓣（假花），挺好的。

酒店因為年頭久確實設施有點舊了，但不是對這些要求過於敏感的話是不妨礙入住的，房間都很寬敞。陽台風景也很美。早餐種類不是很多，但味道都還不錯。停車也很方便。娛樂室有麻將房是麻將迷的福音😁總體還是很滿意。

管家很貼心，為我們安排了高樓層，在房間裏可以看到美麗的海景，還能看到海上日出。真的好美。我們入住海景套房，有兩張大床，床墊一個軟一點，一個硬一點，正好孩子長者都合適。睡的很舒服。
酒店泳池也很好，就是這幾天三亞有點涼，孩子們衹下了一次水，玩了一小會兒。不過也很開心。

酒店前面小花園有小門可以直達海灘，這裏的海灘人也不多，比較清凈！
酒店早餐樣式還可以，比較推薦煎餅果子、煮麪、煮米粉、椰絲餡兒包子、辣炒海鮮、椰子飲料、咖啡。麪包樣式還可以，衹是我本身不是很喜歡麪包，沒有嘗試。
楊桃、百香果很新鮮！

還給了好多優惠券，星巴克買一贈一還是很值的，其他的優惠也不錯雖然沒用上。

環境：酒店離沙灘很近，離西島也很近，有大泳池，但是泳池得水實在是太涼了，最後回房間泡浴池去了， 一大早上就去拍日出了，走幾步就到沙灘了，酒店性價比非常高。

唯一的缺點就是地下車庫找到電梯的方式太複雜了，不過這個也是無法改善的吧

唯一就是感覺酒店設施比較老了 感覺可以更新換代一波 跟上年輕人的審美和節奏

msg:做攻略的時候在網上刷到的三亞灣皇冠假日酒店，深入瞭解後立即決定就它了，到了後確實眼前一亮，首先酒店在三亞灣的最西邊，離機場和西島碼頭都很近，打車10多分鐘就到酒店了，前台服務態度非常好，講解了各項事宜很快就辦理好了入住，還給我們升級了房型，進入房間的那一刻就知道這就是來海邊應該有的樣子，從陽台看出去藍天，大海，沙灘，椰林，泳池盡收眼底，吹着海風整個人就感受到了海邊度假的舒適。作為比較老牌的五星級酒店，內部各項設施都還比較完善，去景點，吃飯等也都比較方便，在三亞打車還是挺快的，因此住的稍微偏一點都是沒關係的，乘坐穿梭巴士甚至還去海棠灣玩了一圈，體驗感拉滿，不過有個小建議就是希望能夠提升一下洗護用品的質量，洗髮水洗完後頭發會有點不舒服，酒店其餘都可圈可點，算是被種草了，也會願意推薦給朋友。酒店管家李芝樺也會提供很貼心的服務，各種需求都可以通過微信直接給管家留言並會在最快的時間得到答覆，非常省心。
