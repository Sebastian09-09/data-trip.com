msg:Upon arrival we asked the reception staff for places to visit. The manager took the trouble to find out our interests and very kindly wrote down the names of the places for us. Another reception staff Ms Jenny Tang also helped to locate a shop where we could buy dragon beard and booked us a didi there. Service was warm and personal without being obtrusive. The good service extended to the room service staff who were friendly and very obliging when we asked for more towels for a late checkout.

The hotel itself had a beautiful swimming pool. My son used the gym which he said was very well-kept and spacious. Our stay was comfortable and enjoyable. The room was of a good size and everything worked. Overall, a highly recommended hotel in Beijing. Thank you for your kind service!

Rooms are clean, wifi is working. Swimming pool is also nice. 
Also I have to thanks to the manager of the hotel. 
We were deceived by a taxi driver who charged too much for a ride from the airport. We argued with him for a long time near the entrance to the hotel, the manager saw this and came over to find out what happened. Having learned the details of the situation, she took a picture of the car’s license plate number and wrote a complaint, and after 3 days we got our money back!

The breakfast spread was delicious. I also love that they have coffee machine in the room- so fancy! The only downside is that the hotel seems old. The interiors in the room is old but anyhow it is clean so that is what matters. They should start renovating the rooms. Overall though the stay was great.

msg:My parents came to Beijing to play and wanted to live closer to the city center. They booked Kuntai Royal Hotel in the most central area! The price is a little expensive, but friends who will not stay for too long can give it a try. You will not be disappointed! !

The hotel is near Chaoyangmen, easy to find and convenient for transportation. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Justice are nearby. Don't worry about safety. Behind the road is Youtang Plaza and Parkview Green. There are also Maimai and various fast food restaurants, convenience stores and coffee shops. It is super convenient to eat and drink. Breakfast is also available! Ritan Park and the box are within a five-minute walk. You can spend half a day walking around!

We didn't come until after nine o'clock in the evening. Because my parents didn't want to stay in a big bed, the sister at the front desk upgraded us to an executive room with a view of China Zun! Zundu is very nice. The night view is super beautiful at night! I forgot to take a photo 55) Although the environment and decoration are not very new, the facilities of a star hotel are nothing to say, and the bedding is very clean. There is no mold or black spots, so friends with cleanliness are blessed! ! Then there are gyms and spas. I heard that many foreign guests and foreign troupes who come to perform also stay here. I hope to meet them by chance next time!

When I checked in, I saw a child taking the initiative to arrange a room with children’s books and toys for us, and also gave them to the child. We got some snacks and took us to the room in person. The hotel is not far from the subway station. It takes about seven or eight minutes to walk. Opposite is the Dongyue Temple. Not far away is the U-Tang Shopping Center, which is also very convenient for eating. It is cleaned every day and the water is replenished in a timely manner. Even if you have not opened the bottle and drank it the day before, you will still replenish four bottles of water. I am tired from going out every day, but I feel relieved when I come back.

msg:When traveling with a mother and a one-year-old daughter, it was quite difficult to find a connecting room or a twin-bed suite, so I booked it immediately after seeing that Quintiles’ connecting room was very affordable. I knew it was an old hotel before booking, so when I saw that the lobby was relatively small, the room decoration was old, and the breakfast was crowded, I actually thought it was OK. My family was spending the weekend, and I thought the price-performance ratio for two rooms at more than 1,000 yuan was really good.
However, I don’t require the hotel’s service to be very good, it should be more or less consistent with common sense, right? On the first day of check-in, I drove to the hotel entrance, and the concierge didn't even help me with my luggage. I took two pieces of luggage with my children and elders to the lobby to check in, and the concierge took a look and left. The girl at the front desk didn't even have polite words to speak, and she couldn't even say hello. There was a guy next to her who was answering questions for her and introducing breakfast and so on.
Because breakfast was not included in the room rate, I prepaid for breakfast for two days separately. The next day because our daughter got up late, we didn't go downstairs to eat. When I checked out, I asked if the breakfast fee for the next day could be refunded. The front desk said no. We need to inform them one day in advance, otherwise they will not be refunded. They told the front desk when we checked in. I must have said that.
Excuse me???
First of all, she 100% didn’t tell me when she checked in, and she swiped the wrong card when charging. She swiped my card an extra 200 yuan and said she would deduct two days of breakfast from me, but the first swipe was only for the first day of the reservation. I haven't told her yet that I want to extend my stay.
Secondly, in what era are we now, do we still have this kind of overlord clause? I paid and didn’t eat, so why don’t I get a refund? It’s not that I went to a restaurant to order food and you refused to refund it if I ordered it, or it’s not that I didn’t eat the meal myself as the room rate included meals. If it was the case of these two situations, I would never unreasonably ask for a refund.
Although I refunded the money in the end, it was because the front desk made the wrong payment. Otherwise, judging from the appearance of the front desk, I would have been fighting for a long time without refunding. I told her that I was a black diamond and had stayed in so many hotels. I had never had to tell the hotel a day in advance if I didn’t want to eat. She smiled contemptuously and I still remember her expression to this day.
I have stayed in many five-star hotels in Beijing. I have been in Beijing for more than ten years, and I understand the culture of Beijing. No matter how good the hardware is, the service may not be very warm and thoughtful, but this experience at Quintiles is really amazing. It gave me some knowledge. Leaving aside hardware, hotel services are actually the lowest cost inves**ent. Your hotel management should reflect on this. I really recommend you to go to a hotel in Luoyang and learn it, don’t be so arrogant.

1. When I checked in at the front desk, I was given a room card. It was 2024, and basically domestic five-star hotels don't need electricity cards, so it's normal to only give one. But after entering the room, I actually needed an electricity card.
2. There were only two bottles of water in such a large room.
3. The bathroom was extremely old, the floor drain in the room was rusty, and the water was draining slowly.
4. The furniture in the guest room was old and there were strange noises.
5. There was no welcome service.

Unsatisfactory:
There is no food delivery robot, so you have to go downstairs to pick up takeaways yourself;
The breakfast was unpalatable. Things like pickles, minced green onion and coriander seemed to have been left out for several days and were dry.

We two adults plus a teenager live in a twin room without extra money. There are also several choices of pillows, and the air conditioning in the room is also sufficient. There is a large swimming pool and jacuzzi, but the changing rooms are relatively small and old.
The little brother who sent the luggage to the room not only introduced the room facilities, but also enthusiastically told us the things to pay attention to when traveling and how to go to the scenic spots. He also greeted us every time we entered and exited the door.
Check-in is also very fast and polite.
The aunt who was in charge of cleaning the room was also very clean, and brought fruit on the third day of our stay.
The location is also very good. There are many bus stops on the main road. There are many restaurants and large supermarkets opposite. There are two subway stations 400m away from the hotel, which is very convenient.
The room charge is not high either.
If I come to Beijing again next time, I will still choose this one, it's cost-effective.

The decoration of the facilities can be seen to be the standard of more than ten years ago. It is definitely not good now. It should be better at that time. After all, it is listed as a five-star hotel. There, the standard should not be low either. The room is small, quite satisfactory, with no features or flaws. Ten minutes walk away from Gongti, the rooms facing north can still see Gongti, so it is a more economical and affordable place to stay if you come to Beijing as a foreigner to watch football in Gongti.

At that time, the front desk clerk inquired and said that there is a suitable room, not the end room, and just come back in the evening to pick up the room card. In the evening, I went back to the hotel to get the room card. When I went upstairs, I saw that it was the last room. I called the front desk and said that all the rooms are full now, and there is no way to adjust. I would like to ask the hotel service staff, since the agreement has been promised and a note has been made, why do you still have to give it to the room? ! Also, although the hotel is an old five-star hotel, the infrastructure is outdated, the room has a musty smell, and the sewer pipes have a bad smell.

From the etiquette hand strap at the door to help guests open and close the car door; to the active and considerate gift of a handbag when storing luggage, so that it is convenient to bring snacks to children; and after checking in, the warm and thoughtful service of the waiter Ms. Luo Lihua made us feel at home for the first time. She thought about what the guests thought, and took it into consideration for the guests without the guests asking. It was a great stay experience. There is also a swimming pool on the second floor. Whether it is the aunt who does the cleaning or the slightly older security uncle, they all gave warm and considerate service. There are also two small hot springs in the swimming pool. It is so refreshing to soak in it after a day of playing. It’s a pity that the itinerary for the next day was arranged, so I booked another hotel in advance, otherwise I really didn’t want to leave. When I left the hotel the next day, my mother specially wrote a paper thank-you letter to the hotel. If I have the opportunity to come to Beijing again in the future, I will definitely come to this hotel again! !

msg:The service of the old-fashioned five-star hotel is super unconvincing. The little brothers and sisters at the front desk are warm and thoughtful, making you feel very close. It’s like a family. The room is warm, spacious and bright. Drink a cup☕, and you can see the bustling city immediately when you look up Modern, but also ancient, this is the unique charm of Greater Beijing that you yearn for! If you are tired from work, go to the gym, swim, and enjoy the sunshine swimming pool. I like it very much. The most satisfying thing is that their staff provide good service. If you come to Beijing, you will live here✌

The room is very warm in winter, and the facilities in the room are complete. The bed is very big, super big and very comfortable~ There is a bathtub in the shower, a coffee machine, an audio humidifier in the house, and a large floor-to-ceiling window to see the scenery~ I didn't have breakfast because I slept late, so I have to experience breakfast next time! The sanitation is also very clean. I like such a clean and quiet hotel~ The room service is very timely. I call for everything quickly, and check-out is also very convenient. I am satisfied.

There is Utang Plaza near the hotel. There are many restaurants and entertainment in it. The hotel is more business-oriented, so I took my baby to Utang to play for a long time.
The underground parking lot is free. Remember to register at the front desk to ask for a ticket before going out. I feel that due to the epidemic, the hotel business is not very good and there are not many people.
The room service is very good. She is a southern sister who helps us get water and fruit. The breakfast is quite satisfactory, anyway, there is no problem with eating enough.
The price is more than 500, I can accept it for an old five-star. Especially the free parking is a plus.

It is so gloomy that it is very depressing to live in a room without windows. 2. In terms of rooms: the bed is not as good as the express hotel, it is very uncomfortable to lie down very short, and I haven't fallen asleep all night. The layout of the room is also very awkward, like the decoration style of an old hotel in the 90s, and the facilities are also very outdated, suitable for the uncle who likes nostalgia. 3. In terms of service: I arrived late at night and ordered a takeaway. The security at the door refused to let the takeaway boy come in. The phone was also rejected. The takeaway was still at the door of the hotel like rubbish. I came down to question, but the security did not admit it. Let the courier brother come in. When checking out, the front desk said that the hotel refused to accept guest express delivery, which is really a bully. This is the five-star hotel with the worst experience!

msg:My husband and I stayed with children for two days, and my two friends stayed for one day. In fact, the breakfast is not too rich. Compared with other five-star hotels, the taste is not bad and the service is also very good. It is because I want to live with the children. Taking her to swim around is also quite prosperous and I don't want her to toss about it. It just happens that when a friend comes to Beijing, it is very cost-effective, and parking is free! But my daughter didn’t sleep here the next day. I don’t know why. The first night was fine. The next day I played at more than 7 o’clock. I wanted to let her sleep and then eat. But she kept crying. After drinking the milk, it was more than 8 o’clock. It was almost nine o’clock and took her to eat first, to the Munich Beer Hall, but I don’t know what happened, she got stuck again and vomited all over. She vomited and cried hard when we ate and we hadn’t prepared a good meal. I packed the checkout and went back. I’m sorry that the restaurant vomited on the baby’s chair, but the waiter was very nice and kept comforting us. My father took off her clothes and put her on to the hotel. I was afraid that the waiter would say that she didn’t wear a shirt, but the waiter watched. When I asked if the baby had cried and learned that it was vomiting and wanted to make something for the baby to eat, we declined, and went to the room to take a bath, she did not drink milk or eat, she was very happy in the bath, and slept for half an hour. Suddenly we started to cry and pierced our lungs. We were also very afraid of quarreling other guests. Moreover, if she didn't eat or drink, she meant that there was no way at the door. Dad said or let us go home. We stopped crying after we finished talking. I went back and fell asleep in my arms as soon as I went out. I didn’t make any noise anymore. I came back to pack up the next morning. It may be the first time I lived outside for two days. Yue, I took her out several times before, but there was nothing wrong with staying all night. I still miss the bed at home because I was too young... I still like this hotel! Especially because when I was a child, I lived behind the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and wanted to take my daughter around. Although everything changed, she was very happy that she went to the World Trade Center on the first day.

酒店雖然臨街但不會感覺很吵，隔音很好。早餐品種豐富，餐食口感很不錯。
酒店前台工作人員朱小哥服務態度很好，有問題都會耐心解答。後又辦了續住，朱小哥耐心幫我解決了換房間的麻煩。辦理入住時很迅速，有應退房很快，由於網上訂的，房費付款過了，不開發票可以直接離店。地下提供免費的停車場，但是需要車開走前到禮賓部開取停車票。
房間是暖光燈，床頭沒有插座，但是有配備USB插排。房間有保險箱，有咖啡機和加濕器，總的來説還是很好的客房服務員很細心周到。
整體下來入住體驗還是很不錯的。入住天數較長的可以附近逛逛。以後還會再來哦[微笑]

2房間每天衹提供2瓶水，再多要居然説8元一瓶礦泉水，收費！
3外賣不給送上樓也就算了，居然禮賓部都不可以暫時放置外賣，導致如果不能立馬下樓取的時候，外賣小哥就很辛苦！非常不人性化！
夜裡外賣小哥餐品到了，不能馬上下樓取的時候還要被前台工作人員懟！是懟！沒錯！我們不能給送，你現在這不接電話呢麼 為什麼不能自己下來取！你不是就在房間呢麼！都是原話
就是被這麼服務的，都是花錢來給他們工作人員打工來了！
