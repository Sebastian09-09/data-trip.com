The hotel has good taste; the quality is fierce, the decoration and decoration supplies are very particular about the colors and paintings, artistic and stylish, and the stones used are very high-end. The front desk checks in üà∂ Many stones are made into seal-style decorations, symbolizing the spirit of contract.
The whole environment is very beautiful, with a scene at every step. The lobby, Chinese and Western restaurants, spa area, and public area greening are all beautiful, suitable for taking photos.
SPA, afternoon tea, sailing, yoga, and cooking classes were given, and the experience was good.
The Chinese restaurant is especially delicious, and I ate three meals.
Finally, the highlight of the hotel is that the service is really thoughtful and considerate. All the waiters are kind, enthusiastic and proactive, and respond to my needs in a timely manner. Ambassador Jolie added WeChat in advance, and no matter how long it took to send messages, the replies were very timely. Service is a big highlight.
Qishang is really great, and the experience is very satisfactory. It is worthy of being the best hotel in Xiamen, and it is worth the trip:

Facilities: The hotel's hardware facilities are among the best in Xiamen. The room and bathroom are large enough with a balcony suitable for smokers. The kettle, coffee machine, and hair dryer are Dyson. The room layout is reasonable. There are 4 long sofas, 2 balconies and 2 rooms. This is really suitable for Ge You to lie down.

Hygiene: The room is cleaned, and the night bed cleaning is not perfunctory. Water and disposable items will be replenished, and used towels will be replaced.

Environment: The hotel will have some Internet celebrities to open afternoon tea. The design is unique and the room can see the sea.

Service: The service is in place. Dinner was in the hotel. Because I was in a hurry to watch the concert, I wanted to pack the unfinished lobster rice and wait for the concert to end to heat it up and send it to the room. I didn't expect the hotel to consider the taste and even make a new one. It was good. It was delivered to the room when we arrived. It was really thoughtful.

Minibar: It's all free and the quality is quite rich.

Finally, I want to say that the hotel's Chinese restaurant and Japanese food are great! Breakfast is a semi-self-service order. The ingredients are fresh and exquisite! Next time I come to Xiamen, I will continue to choose Qishang!

I stayed here alone for 2 nights and was very happy and relaxed. I will come back for vacation after a while.

msg:I am a Singaporean tourist. This time I took my wife to Wuyuan to see the rapeseed flowers. I chose to transfer between Xiamen North Railway Station and Gaoqi T3. I chose to stay at Qishang Hotel because it is close to the T3 terminal. The design of Qishang Hotel is novel and unique. The open-plan beautiful environment on the first floor is similar to the open-plan building on the first floor of Singapore HDB. Of course, the hotel provides design decoration and leisure sofas, tables and chairs, and romantic lighting at night, so that guests can enjoy the sea breeze and watch the scenery. Looking at the night view, we stayed in Room 1516. The balcony faced the sea. It was spacious and comfortable, and the lighting could be adjusted at will. The TOTO toilet was equipped with a sensor toilet seat cover, and the double washbasin was equipped with toiletries. The shampoo was also very good, and 4 large bars were provided. Bath towels, face towels, hand towels, and foot towels are really thoughtful and complete. The beverages are very rich, including tea, tea sets, coffee, beer, mineral water, and fruit juice and soda. When the taxi arrived at the door of the hotel, two hotel employees quickly came forward to help pick up the luggage and take it to the front desk. Mr. He Peichen checked us in. The hotel employees were very warm and polite, giving the guests a warm feeling of being at home. The long service table and wine tasting table on the platform are one long table, I don‚Äôt know if it means a long time (wine). Guests can sit and enjoy the timely delivery of hand towels and Tieguanyin tea. Mr. He was skilled and fast, and his colleagues also actively cooperated in printing passports. We were quickly led to the guest room by a dedicated person. Knowing that it was our first time to stay in Qishang, he patiently and meticulously introduced us to the use of various facilities in the room, including reminders of the environment. There are many green plants. When using the balcony, be careful of mosquitoes flying into the room. Although I didn't remember his name, I still thanked him very much. Suddenly there was a knock on the door, and when the door opened, there was another surprise: sugar water desserts and fruit plates, just like the Southern Fujian people who always encounter a delicious snack when they are guests. I will continue to experience staying here if I have the opportunity in the future.

The breakfast buffet had less items because there were a la carte dishes...
The swimming pool was pretty nice but it was not open at the time...
If I go to Xiamen again during the summer vacation, I will probably bring my kids to stay here again to experience the spa and the hotel's own activities

The whole hotel is full of woody fragrance, which makes people put down all worldly worries. The spa center is open to all guests staying in the hotel. Spa, hot stone lounge chairs, steam rooms, singing bowls and other projects can let you fully let go of fatigue. In short, it deserves to be the top 1 in Xiamen. Dylan is very considerate and nice (super handsome little brother, it is simply the face value), and Vivian's explanation and tour also let people fully understand the story behind the hotel.
I believe that people who meet again will definitely meet again, and I hope to see you again soon.

üî∑Hotel environment
As soon as you enter the door, you can feel the secluded garden style of the Pu series, but the lobby and the public area behind it make people return to Sanya. The garden style and the island style are well integrated. The environment of the whole hotel makes people feel relaxed. The garden behind the lobby is beautiful in the evening. The room is very large, and you can see the sea while lying on the balcony.
‚Äî
üî∑Hotel service
The concierge and the front desk are very enthusiastic. The driver who sent us here forgot the luggage in the trunk and was about to drive away. The concierge immediately rushed out to stop the car, which was very touching. After checking in, there was a special person to take us to the room and introduce the hotel and Xiamen cuisine along the way. Service ambassador Vera asked us what we needed to prepare for the room from the day before check-in. She was always concerned about our feelings during the check-in and helped solve the problem one day after check-out. She was very considerate.
‚Äî
üî∑Geographic location
It is very close to the airport, on the edge of Wuyuan Bay. It is very comfortable to take a walk across the street and blow the sea breeze at night.
‚Äî
üî∑Personal experience
It is very suitable for a lazy vacation. You don‚Äôt need to go anywhere in the hotel. I can lie in the spa pool all day. There are many places to take photos. In the afternoon, many people took photos in the public area. In comparison, the service of the Chinese restaurant and the Western restaurant is very different. The water cup is empty and they don‚Äôt know how to refill it. There are other problems, but they were all solved in the end.

The graphic design and lighting architectural decorations inside are also very attentive and meaningful. The a**osphere is full and there are scenes everywhere, which is very suitable for taking pictures. The spa is also impeccable and full of characteristics. There are also many free courses that are worth experiencing: "yoga, tea culture, cocktails, etc." In addition, I tried breakfast, lunch and dinner, the taste is nice, and the restaurant environment has different a**ospheres at different times.
The most important thing is that the service of "Manager He Peichen and private butler Luna" is so thoughtful! The ceiling service of domestic hotels is just like this. Thank you again for your attentiveness and thoughtfulnessüëç Talents must be promoted and raised crazily. I have recommended the hotel to my friends around me to experience it.

msg:I came here because of its reputation. It is really good.

Facilities: It has been opened for several years and is still in good condition. Except for the furniture in the afternoon tea area, which may be used frequently, the other furniture is relatively new and well maintained. Designers and people with obsessive-compulsive disorder will see many comfortable design details. I saw that there were no facilities for children before. When I arrived, I found that it was very close to the yacht club and there were many sea activities within a few steps. The children had a lot of fun during this off-peak trip.

Hygiene: Standard and worry-free. The staff who clean the guest rooms took the initiative to ask about the supply needs of spare parts when they saw the children.

Environment: Quiet, many design details are very Zen. The baby said, "Mom, let's go on an adventure together." So we walked around the hotel. I relaxed very well. It happened to rain in the lobby when the "adventure was over." The baby ate ice cream and smiled sweetly. We looked out the window together. The raindrops fell on the landscape and water like stars.

Service: The overall feeling of the employees is very young and cute. I said that the scale is very comfortable. I personally prefer a relaxed a**osphere. This is a parent-child trip. The front desk lady always takes out toys to make the children happy at the right time. The lady in the restaurant noticed that the baby loved to eat a cookie and told her that there were not many left and took the initiative to replenish it. I encouraged the baby to take it herself. The baby said she was shy. Another lady who didn't know where she was hiding suddenly appeared and brought her a small plate, like a small gift from heaven. There is also Vera, a very cute young girl. She is very careful every time she contacts you. She will try her best to meet your requirements.

Xiazhong Restaurant Dining 100 yuan coupon: used, very suitable for business banquet environment. We had a simple meal and felt that the dishes were not particularly amazing.

Hygiene: The hotel is very hygienic (except for the Chinese restaurant)

Environment: The hotel environment is very good, there are many places to check in. People who like taking pictures can have many check-in points

Service: It must be said that the hotel service is very, very good. Someone contacted one day in advance to inquire about the needs, and there was no problem checking in on the same day. I probably had a stomachache in the hotel's Chinese restaurant on the first night. I originally planned to go out for a walk the next day, but I had a fever all day. The hotel also sent someone to accompany me to see a doctor until the next day. The manager on duty kept asking about my physical condition and sent fruits and millet porridge. I didn't expect the hotel to do this. It was really touching and helped us a lot. It even helped us get a taxi to the airport when we left. It was really impressive. I will definitely stay in Qishang next time I come to Xiamen. Service, environment, facilities There is really nothing to pick in all aspects.
I have a small opinion. When I checked in, the hotel should have told me whether there were any discount coupons for food and beverages and other benefits. I was not sure whether I had this discount until I went to eat. I had to check Ctrip to confirm whether I had this discount. I hope that next time when I cleaned the room, I would ask whether the food should be taken away. The small cake I bought in the restaurant downstairs before going to the hospital was taken away after I came back from the hospital. I was really confused. I might have thought that I had eaten it like lunch. üòÇ The hotel may need to improve the hygiene of the Chinese restaurant. I had diarrhea after eating on the first day. My girlfriend had acute gastroenteritis on the second day. I didn‚Äôt eat anything other than the hotel. On the second night, I also ordered food from the hotel‚Äôs Chinese restaurant. After eating, I started to feel a little nauseous about an hour later, but the situation was not as serious as my girlfriend‚Äôs. However, this experience did slightly reduce the hotel experience.
Although these problems occurred, I still look forward to coming to the hotel next time. Except for this problem, the hotel is basically impeccable and the service is also at home. The hotel management team is greatüëçüèª

The location of the hotel is very suitable because I want to stay in a quiet place. It is far away from the downtown area and next to the yacht club. You can choose to participate in the sea activities in the afternoon (I didn‚Äôt go this time because of time constraints). It only takes 15 minutes to go to the airport. The hotel upgraded the room type for free when checking in, and the luggage was delivered to the room by a specialist. The room was carefully decorated in advance according to the requirements and a cake was delivered. The details are very good. The breakfast is semi-buffet. The buffet area has regular cold dishes, fruits, beverages, and hot pasta areas. I like the freshly cooked shacha noodles; other dishes are ordered. It is recommended to choose egg dishes. Ome rolls, Benedict, and pancakes are also OK. Other tastes are slightly flat. The only thing I am not satisfied with is that when I return to the hotel at night, there should be a company team building dinner. The noise in the quiet hotel lobby is particularly loud and lasts for a long time. It can be heard from the lobby until I return to the high-rise room of Building 3. Apart from this, I will stay at Qishang when I go to Xiamen.

After check-out, she also paid attention to some of our itinerary and safety, which was very nice. The hotel manager also had a very good service attitude and helped me carry my luggage all the way to the hotel. Room, introducing various details and usage methods, like it! The free minibar not only has drinks, beer, milk, but also my favorite soda water, as well as snacks and chocolates, so the kids will have a great timeüòÉ
The location is very close to the airport, and it is convenient to travel. Every detail of the hotel is just right. It is very easy to shoot and produce movies. I will continue to stay here next time I go to Xiamen.

Qishang felt that the service was very good. I contacted and added friends a few days before I checked in. Every service staff was very enthusiastic.
The equipment is also very good, including a centrally controlled air conditioner and a Dyson hair dryer.
I also like the design. It's very high-end. Everything is surrounded by water. The hotel also has some small activities. The soaking pool is very big. Unfortunately, I got up late and didn't catch up with the soaking pool so I bought an essential oil! The spa area service is also very good.
I stayed at the Waldorf Astoria the next day and I was completely disappointed. The occupancy rate was too high and the service was poor. The air conditioner in the room was still broken! ! Everyone, don‚Äôt go!

The background is that this hotel has a special service. Breakfast can be delivered to the room, but it needs to be ordered in advance. It may be that the waiter did not pay attention to the menu we ordered in advance on the first day, so it was not delivered the next day. As a result, after contacting the housekeeper Nancy, Not only did I get the results quickly, but the experience in the following days was particularly good. Feeling flattered and very happy. In order to prevent unnecessary imitation and cause trouble, I won‚Äôt go into details, but I will post some beautiful pictures to take a look. In summary from my personal test, the service is very good and the scenery is also very good. Even the drinks at the long bar and the Chinese restaurant are surprisingly good. Super Love it, I will check in again next time. Thank you Nancy for your thoughtful care. I will remember your particularly good service this time. I will come again soon. Hehe

She even knew that the baby was uncomfortable and said that she could prepare them for the baby. White porridge. (My sister suddenly felt unwell before going out, and I didn‚Äôt want to ruin the plan of taking my parents and baby out, so I went out with trepidation.) Knowing that my parents have the habit of drinking tea, I immediately sent them a Kung Fu tea set and drinking water.

Qishang Hotel, seven-star service. I have stayed in many high-end hotels, and this service is second to none. The design style of the hotel is superb, high-end and grand. I have stayed in many high-end hotels, and the service of this hotel has left a deep impression, especially Kimberley at the front desk asked me carefully when I checked in. When I got back to the room, I immediately asked if I was satisfied with the room. I highly praised the manager Snow. Because of a small complaint about breakfast, the restaurant manager personally apologized. The room manager called the room to apologize. The handsome Snow manager called the room. I apologized and waited for me at the front desk before I left. He also personally placed an order and called a special car for me. This crisis public relations was done so well that it made people feel warm and attentive. I highly recommend this hotel. It is a must-stay hotel in Xiamen, Fujian Province. hotel ceiling

In terms of hardware: the lights in the whole house are in dimming mode, equipped with electric sunshades, Dyson hair dryers, toiletries from Tiptik, children's slippers and toothbrushes are prepared after informing in advance that there are children, and the free minibar is equipped with drinks, drinks and chocolates. It is very exquisite. There is also a SPA on the first floor, which is also free of charge. Simply explained, it is similar to a steam sauna.
Software: This is the key! The housekeeper Livia contacted us one night in advance to inform us of all the hotel's services and facilities, as well as the children's cooking class included in the reserved room, and provided timely feedback on all needs during the stay, as well as a souvenir doll for the child. Thank you Livia.
Then from the moment I got off the bus at the hotel, I felt the service quality of the entire hotel. I helped push the luggage to the front desk. I was given scented tea and towels when checking in. After the check-in was successful, the housekeeper directly pushed the luggage to the room and introduced the facilities in the room. After using it, all the service staff I encountered during the entire hotel service process were greeted with smiles.
There is a yacht club behind the hotel. If the weather is good, you can charter a small yacht, speedboat, or sailboat. The weather was very good on the day I went, so I went to experience both the yacht and the speedboat.
In terms of food: The hotel's breakfast is a semi-buffet mode. There are many exquisite Western pastries in a la carte format. Each dish is good and well presented. There are also many choices in the buffet dining area. For dinner, I tried the XIA restaurant in the hotel. It mainly focuses on exquisiteness. The portions of the dishes are not large, but each dish is exquisite and tastes good. It is suitable for 3-4 people and has a better experience. The average per person is expected to be around 300 to 400. .
A very satisfying stay experience, thank you Qishang Hotel, Livia and all the hotel service staff.

msg:Qishang Hotel is the hotel with the highest comprehensive software and hardware evaluation that I have ever stayed in in Fujian. From the hotel ambassador Livia's patient answers and one-stop docking service after booking, we saved a lot of trouble. After arriving at the hotel, you can dine directly in the Western restaurant. The check-in process will be assisted during the meal, which saves waiting time in many aspects. The two-large-and-two-small Western set meal recommended by the ambassador at noon is great value for money. Although it is a two-large and two-small set, it can actually satisfy four adults. The waiter Alison Dai's service is good. The hotel ambassador also made elaborate arrangements for the family's birthday, and the family was very happy. All pools in the hotel are very clear. At the same time, many details are impressive: all service staff will take the initiative to greet guests when they meet them; they often give guests unexpected surprises; they provide a variety of experience activities; the breakfast combines Chinese and Western styles, and the eggs Benedict are very authentic. Overall, it is the best in Xiamen! Sales Director Carrie Wu's overall introduction to the hotel gave us a better understanding of the hotel's brand culture, and we successfully applied to become Leading World members. Thank you again to hotel ambassador Livia for your full service!

My daughter experienced making Kung Fu tea in the room and learned several yoga movements by following the illustrations on the yoga mat. In short, it is a very unique hotel. Just outside the door is the Wuyuan Bay Yacht Marina, which is particularly convenient for experiencing sailing. When I returned to the hotel, what impressed me most was the service. All the service staff I came into contact with in just one day were very warm and friendly, and provided just the right amount of help. My daughter was given a baby elephant as a parting gift.

The hotel arranged for Snow, who had hosted me last time, to be considerate and considerate as usual, and arranged a room + birthday cake + cocktails. From the guest rooms to the restaurants to the SPA, every place is appropriately spacious, comfortable and convenient. The spare parts have not been reduced to large wall-mounted bottles like many international brands. They are still a set of small bottles of Diptyque, which are very easy to use. (This time I also went to the sister hotel Quanzhou Qixu. The amenity is a specially scented shampoo + pillow spray that I collaborated with Wenxian. My boyfriend loves it.) The underground of the hotel is a large SPA space with various functional soaking pools and hot stones. Reclining chairs, dry and wet steaming, and EviDenS care, you can quickly rejuvenate your life after walking 20,000 steps on the mountain and sea trail. Breakfast is semi-buffet style, and the breakfast options are also very rich. It is open until 11 o'clock, so be sure to leave enough time to eat slowly. You can skip lunch entirely. Both times I came to Qishang, I had dinner at the Chinese restaurant. It was delicious, upscale but not too flashy. In addition to sitting in the lobby for afternoon tea, you can also sit on the outdoor promenade while basking in the sun while looking at the bay. Looking forward to coming back next time, I hope the hotel can maintain its benchmark standards and continue to work hard. The only dissatisfaction with my visit to Xiamen this time (not just the hotel) is that the indoor no-smoking management is very poor, and there is no reporting hotline.

msg:I just want to say that as the number one hotel in Xiamen and even in Fujian, it really deserves its reputation. I have lived in Waldorf Astoria and Anshida in Xiamen, and the feeling of Qishang is completely different from other hotels. To sum it up: more premium, sleeker, quieter, and thoughtful service. It meets all-round demands in terms of housing, enjoyment, and food. The hotel's breakfast ends at 11 o'clock. The brunch style, semi-buffet ordering, and high-quality products; It is worth going to eat specifically. The spa pool is free, the environment is good, there are few people, and it feels like a private room. The room is large, and the height of the bed meets personal preference. The bedding is so comfortable that you can sleep until you wake up naturally, with the sound of birds and flowers outside the window, as well as the sound of birds. Here, good service is the best experience. There are heart-warming desserts in the room every night. The first day was peanut sweet soup, and the second day was oa**eal bird's nest porridge. Especially want to say is their service. The service ambassador, Kimberley, called one day in advance to inquire about needs, and took the initiative to help solve any needs after check-in (booking restaurants in advance, sending menus, applying for late check-out, asking about cleaning the room), super warm! The concierge, Susan, warmly helped us with our luggage as soon as we got off the bus, took us to the room thoughtfully, and introduced the various settings of the room. On the second day, he warmly and enthusiastically showed us around the entire hotel, introducing the source of each beautiful scenery, super üëçüëçüëç. In short, three days and two nights left a deep impression on me, and I will choose it next time! grateful!

The design is very stylish, every detail is carefully thought out, and the balcony view is also very good. I will definitely come back to live again.
I like the red tortoise cake mold on the wall, a classic that Hokkien people can get
I like the fragrance in the lobby very much. I planted it hard. It is very similar to santal33 of le labo. I will add the same fragrance after preparation
The breakfast exceeded my expectations. It is semi-buffet, with various categories, and the quality is also very good~ Absolutely great value
The spare part is Diptyque... Personally, I feel a bit tasteless and not easy to use...
It happened to be a Sunday stay, so there were not too many activities to participate in. Fortunately, the WeChat account of Aiden Xiaowu, the concierge, just helped us arrange a cocktail experience. Aiden's service attitude is very good, and the answers to questions are very fast! Next time I hope to have the opportunity to experience activities such as yoga singing bowl tea ceremony

The hotel's semi-buffet breakfast is really rich. I love ta's noodle paste the most. Of course, the freshly baked bread is also delicious! You can even eat breakfast to the point where you can barely support yourself! The mini bar in the room is well-matched, with wine, drinks, and milk... Of course, if you want to have hot tea, there are also basao tea bags, which are all high-end. The bedding at his house was so comfortable that I basically slept until dawn. The room service also responded in a timely manner. There was also free almond sweet soup at night. All in all, it was full of thoughtful surprises.

The only thing I have to complain about is the TV... It would be better if it had a wireless screen projection function. After all, mobile phones and iPads are now very popular. I hope the hotel can improve this and make it better~

I live in Conrad in Xiamen, and I went to Qishang from Andaz. I like Qishang‚Äôs escape from the world, the minimalism of the new Chinese style, and the TV and furniture of LOEWE just like Puxuan in Beijing.
We arrived at the hotel at 12:30 to check in. One day in advance, the housekeeper, Vic, called to communicate with the store about his preferences. He added corporate WeChat and sent a lot of information about the hotel. The service was very good. We also watched the hotel‚Äôs sunset ceremony at 18:00 in the afternoon. Unfortunately, Xiamen was affected by a typhoon and it rained all day without sunset.

Before check-in, the service ambassador vic contacted to ask how many people will stay, their preferences for bedding and pillows, what time to arrive at the store, and the room was prepared early, and children's quilts were also prepared for the children. The child was sick with a cold and had a fever. They delivered brown sugar ginger tea specially prepared for the child for two consecutive days. On the last day, the child was still sick and did not go out to play. Vic specially helped us to delay the check-out until 15:30 in the afternoon, so that we could take the child to have a good rest Then go directly to the airport. It is not uncommon for a beautiful environment to be piled up with money. The environment of Qishang is not only beautiful, but also very stylish, with timeless Zen and low-key luxury. Living here has a kind of tranquility away from the noise and relaxation of the soul. The most important thing is that Qishang's service is attentive. The hotel is the first choice for family trips. Next time you come to Xiamen, you will stay at Qishang. The Wuyuan Bay Yacht Wharf is nearby, and it is very convenient to go out to sea by sailing boat or yacht. The hotel's spa center pool (super massage facilities) and outdoor swimming pool (you can overlook the invincible sea view of Wuyuan Bay and the sailing boats) are very good, and the breakfast is beyond the standard of general five-star hotels. There are freshly baked and hot The waiter will deliver the bread to each table for the guests to enjoy. The eyesight of cleaning the table is also the best in all five-star hotels. It does not disturb the guests at all, but cleans up very promptly, keeping the table clean and tidy.

At the same time, there will also be a 24H service butler to serve us anytime, anywhere [strong]
The good weather in Xiamen and the sea view are really healing in this scene.Ôºú
I am a person who really has very high requirements for the bed üõèÔ∏è!
The bed in Qishang Hotel is the kind of comfort that you can fall asleep in a second~
Lie down and feel relaxed üòå

Hotel breakfast is a semi-buffet and half-order meal!
It feels very environmentally friendly and does not waste [strong], what to eat~
The service is also very good ~ always pay attention to what we need
The handsome guy Alan who has been serving us for the past two daysü§µ
He is the kind of little brother who is careful and caring~ very good Alan

msg:Wow~ It was the first time to stay at Qishang Hotel, which gave our family a very good experience. We stayed for two days, and reluctantly ended our rare trip to Xiamen!

Nancy at the front desk left us a very good impression. She warmly and patiently received and helped us check in. She also cared about whether there was anything we could do to help us. It is worthy of praise.

The hotel's Xia XIA Chinese restaurant made our eyes shine, the fusion of Fujian cuisine and Cantonese cuisine ~ the selection of ingredients is exquisite, fresh and exquisite. Every dish we eat retains the original taste of the ingredients, and it is cooked with care and patience without arrogance or impatience. Hahaha We ate the ginger duck twice, just to make it more delicious. (Breakfast is also top notch, it took a lot of effort)

The room is spacious and bright, and you can see the scenery at a glance while lying on the bed. It is the most comfortable and cozy in the morning and after sunset. All the supplies and decorations in the room seem to be very thoughtful, which makes people relax!

Occasionally, I will go out with my family. It is rare to comment on the hotel I stayed in. It seems that this hotel is also charming.

Look forward to seeing you next time when you come back to Xiamen

msg:Xiamen's itinerary was booked temporarily, but Qishang made the short and hasty itinerary perfect! Generally speaking, I can feel that the hotel cares about me from the beginning to the end. I am very grateful to the concierge Alan for providing meticulous and thoughtful service and help, and I am also very grateful to all the hotel staff who met and provided services behind the scenesüôè

Environment: The hotel is located in Wuyuanwan Wetland Park, facing the bay and close to the yacht center. Get up in the morning and jog along the bay for more than 6km. There are few people and quiet, very pleasant. Room 2301 was asigned. It is a room that can see both the sea view and the garden view. I recommend it~

Facilities: The traces left by urban resorts can be seen in many aspects. The design and construction quality of the hotel is excellent. I believe it can be regarded as a hotel with a ceiling in southern China. Supplies and spare parts are also solid luxury, LOEWE TV, Dyptique washing and care, PG round tub, Axor shower, Dyson hair dryer, etc., match the hotel positioning very well.

Service: The very meticulous and considerate service allows us to travel without thinking. Alan and the hotel staff will inform the traffic information, confirm the arrival time and individual requirements before the trip. After arriving at the store, there will be a very detailed introduction to the hotel and its surroundings, and room tour , Turn down, good night porridge, stretching guidance before going to bed, too many considerate services have been seen. LongBar and breakfast are especially recommended. The bartender and all the staff in the breakfast room are very nice. The meals and wine are perfect. There is no problem that the Chinese food that is said on the Internet is seldom served cold. Local specialties such as noodle paste and sand tea noodles are available, as well as Chinese hot dishes and porridge, regular classic western dishes, and more than 18 kinds of bread~

There is also a small surprise gift when you check out, it is really a perfect holiday ending! Thank you Qishang, I will come again next timeüíï

msg:The hotel is about 25 minutes' drive from Xiamen North Railway Station. I did my homework and specially booked a classic harbor one-bedroom room type. Unfortunately, it was cloudy when I came, otherwise the scenery should be better, but the night view of the room is very good. There is a large wetland park near the hotel. At the beginning, I read the guide and said that there are cycling activities, but I asked the front desk of the hotel that there is no official one, but the front desk will recommend you WeChat for renting bicycles in Xiamen. We rented a car and rode in the park near the hotel. Although it was a little rainy, the air was super good, and there were single lanes. It was a great riding experience! The hotel butler will add your WeChat before you check in, and you can communicate with the butler in advance if you have any questions. The hotel also has different activities every day, such as jogging, Pilates, yoga, beauty classes, etc. But please note that the spa says that the end time is 10:00, but the free bathing pool will be closed at 21:30. Friends who want to catch the last bus should pay attention to the time, and don't run out like us. The bathroom accessories are Diptyque, equipped with a Dyson hair dryer. The breakfast is quite rich, and there are freshly baked croissants. I recommend the chocolate croissant, with a crispy skin and a mouthful of chocolate filling. It's amazing! The whole accommodation experience is still very good, the hotel staff are very warm and considerate, and I am very grateful to Camila for her help. There is welcome tea and a lychee when you check in. There will be sugar water and fruit at night, and there will be milk by the bed. The main one will make you fall asleep sweetly.

You still remember that I prepared a room with a very good view for me! Qishang is not the most expensive hotel I have stayed in, but it is really the best hotel I have ever experienced. There are no brand-name products with big logos and piles of money, and there are no annoying unknown fragrances and rules. More The most important thing is that it is close to nature and quiet, and you can feel the natural taste when you go out for a walk. This is a suite of more than 7,000 a night. Every penny makes you feel that it is worth the money. It is super Zen. The hotel's meals are available 24 hours a day I made it, and I was able to eat such a warm meal when I arrived very late. The breakfast was delivered in time during the day, and the ingredients were very fresh. I was very happy to eat
Next time I go to Xiamen, I will continue to choose Qishang Hotel! Comparing heartü´∞

msg:It was my first time traveling and staying in a hotel after the epidemic. The environment was clean and comfortable. The hotel smelled very good. I felt that the lobby was replaced with a sandalwood-like fragrance at night. Due to some changes during check-in, the room was changed. The service of Snow at the front desk is indeed enough to support the style of this hotel. The super five-star service is patient and friendly enough. There is welcome tea and hand towels when you first arrive at the front desk. At the reception, there are warm hibiscus tea for women and cold-brewed Tieguanyin for men. There is also Jude, the front desk supervisor, whose professional and fast communication and service made the whole trip a complete one. The front desk reception is the facade of a hotel, and the service and process give people a really good experience. Qishang is a butler-style service. I think the front desk should be the essence of this hotel. The food in the Chinese restaurant is very good. Because of the surprise at noon, I was full again for dinner, and I relied on life space to balance my guilt. The hotel is located by the bay, and you can reach the bay by walking in three to five minutes. There are often three or five long-tailed birds playing on the hotel lawn. The toiletries used in the room taste very good. The Dyson hair dryer, smart toilet, and the bar are available for use. The bedding is very comfortable. I don‚Äôt know what brand the quilt core is. It seems a little silky. It is that one pillow is too low and the other is too high. Maybe everyone has different habits. By the way, we could order food to the room for breakfast, but we still went to the western restaurant. The location facing the swimming pool can see the bay. There are not many breakfasts on display, but surprisingly, there is also an order service and freshly baked food every day. Recommended by the table, I ate too much. Breakfast is from 7:00 to 11:00, it feels like you are in Sanya, a free and unmissable breakfast. Maybe I haven't traveled for a long time, maybe the experience is so good that I wrote so much. By the way, there is a parking lot in the ba*****t for self-driving.

 1. The quality of western steaks can be better, but there is still a gap compared with Four Seasons Hotel.
2. The light switch is innovative, but because of the innovation, most people are confused when using it, so there must be a guideline.
3. The phone buttons are all in English, and there is also a user guide.
4. The fixed position of the shower head in the bathroom is too low. When applying shower gel, I don‚Äôt know how to put the shower head.
5. The sound insulation of the door is relatively poor. When someone walks by, the sound is clear.
6. The TV is a bit small.
7. The double bed is 1.2 meters wide, and the queen bed is 1.8 meters wide. For such a spacious room, it is still a bit small, and it is not easy to sleep with children.
8. The first floor of the ba*****t does not stop the cars of the residents, but there are no signs to guide them.
Overall, it is still very good, the scenery and environment are too beautiful, but it can be improved.

msg:Qishang is very surprising. Whether it is the environmental landscape or the service, it is very worthwhile. The concierge, Aiden Xiaowu, is really patient and thinks of the guests. Aiden also helped me record the video of the room view. I was satisfied with the view, and then I asked my colleagues to help me carry the luggage. It was really great. Thank you a lot. This time I didn't go to any scenic spots, and I took a rest in Qishang, and it was very cured.

msg:As a hotel of the original Pu series products. will not be disappointed. Many details are in place, and the design elements that show the combination of Western and modern culture are just right in the accessories and public spaces of the hotel. Unassuming, but also a sense of memory. Due to the problem of facing the view of the room, the handsome guy Mr. He at the front desk readily helped me upgrade the room and introduced the supply and demand of the room to me. Considerate and thoughtful. The hotel's spa area is very healing, elegant and quiet, which makes the rhythm slow down quickly. It is worth experiencing. When checking out, Luna, the beauty at the front desk, sincerely sought advice on improving the accommodation, and gave handmade refreshments. Very nice, I believe Qishang will continue to flourish in the hearts of every hotel owner.

msg:Qishang Hotel is worthy of the ceiling of Xiamen Resort Hotel, and I would like to thank Alice for taking care of me during my stay and let us start an unforgettable honeymoon trip.

Facilities: All the bathrooms use Hansgrohe high-end brand Axor, the furniture chooses upper and lower furniture, the room is equipped with Loewe TV, and the hardware configuration is impeccable among Xiamen hotels.

Environment: The hotel with the strongest sense of vacation in Xiamen. Several multi-storey buildings are enclosed and arranged to form a variety of architectural spaces. The design pays attention to light and shadow changes and plant collocation, creating a rich landscape space.

Service: Few domestic hotels provide butler-style service, and the itinerary is confirmed one day in advance. Thanks to Ambassador Qishang Alice for the information about the hotel's activities and business facilities, which made the stay feel at home.

Seeing our family of three check-in, she was very enthusiastic to bring small toys for the children, and carefully helped prepare the children's toiletries.

msg:Overall, the design concept is special. On the first day of check-in, the inner garden view may make people feel that there is a lack of privacy and the windows cannot be opened at night, but it is very suitable for sitting on the outside seats in the morning. Although I heard that I could see the sunset from the bay view room on the second day, it was very foggy due to the weather, and it felt good to look out at the yacht club.
I want to add a small episode in the middle. On the first night at 3:00 a.m., I was harassed by a drunk guest who kicked and slammed the door. After responding to the front desk at breakfast the next day, Momoco coordinated compensation and changed to a room with a view of the bay, although The response is considered timely and I promise to pay more attention in the future, but as a five-star hotel, it should pay attention to the status of the guests staying in the hotel, give guidance to the drunk guests, and hope to improve in the future.
In addition, the more distinctive feature is the spa pool, similar to the hot springs, which are very unique and worth trying, suitable for after exercise. The environment of the gym is a bit stuffy, and the ventilation system is not very good. Although it will be a little windy when the door is opened, it is really not suitable for aerobic exercise in it.
The last thing to complain about is the semi-buffet breakfast. The English breakfast model is not complete. The English breakfast pays attention to tea, but there are only two types of tea, English black tea and jasmine green tea. Although the two-day buffet has improved slightly, it is recommended to eat in Semi-self-service with Chinese elements.

msg:Full five-point praise, exceeding expectations! I booked here on the last day of my trip to Xiamen. I spent 15 minutes in the hotel to relax and clear away my fatigue. It's perfect.

Environment: By Wuyuan Bay, a very quiet place, you can go for a walk by the beach. The hotel is very beautiful, the decoration, garden view, and water system are all great, especially the light and shadow under the sunset and the lights at night, which are so beautiful.

Facilities: The rooms are fully symmetrical in design, with exquisite bathroom and bedding products, yoga mats, free minibar with chocolates, sweet soup in the evening, and a corner of the sea view from the balcony of the garden view room.

Spa pool experience: The sunken super large spa has a jacuzzi, hot spring pool, steam room, and hot stone chairs in the rest area, which are so comfortable! When I came in the afternoon, it was almost reserved. You can see the outside garden during the day, but you can‚Äôt see it at night.

Breakfast: Buffet + order, there are a lot of people during the Spring Festival, ordering is very slow, but the quality of breakfast is very good.

Disadvantages: The sound insulation of the room is not good, the water in the massage pool of the spa is a bit cold, and many people in the public area during the Spring Festival have no sense of privacy. It is a little far away from the scenic spots, so it is suitable for hotels.

In addition, there are some activities in the hotel, such as singing bowls, yoga, and sunset activities, you can pay attention to them.

msg:This time I took my children and wife to Xiamen for a trip. Before coming here, it is better to check where to live on Ctrip. Finally, through continuous understanding, I chose to stay at this "Xiamen Qishang Hotel" a few days ago.
Through communicating with the waiter after check-in, I learned that the boss is the boss of the Septwolves, and the hotel hired three foreign designers with a lot of money to work together
Carefully designed and built, it is no wonder that the hotel, including the details, is so exquisite and beautiful, full of Zen.
When checking in at the hotel, the waiter at the front desk gave us a
Three sips of tea and a hot towel to clean the dust. This is something I have never experienced in previous hotels. When I asked the waiter: "Is the hotel in Xiamen one of the better ones?" The hotel staff said confidently, "Our hotel The best in Xiamen". I feel very good about this, very confident!
Because I felt that the hotel was not very full that day, the staff also showed us a room with a panoramic sea view, which was indeed very good. The hotel room is still very luxurious, the hair dryer is also Dyson brand, and the hotel supplies are also of good brands. The Minibar in the room is provided for free once a day, and there are quite a lot of types! In the evening, tremella soup was delivered to our family of three, and extra pillows and nail clippers were also provided after demand, which is very good! The only dissatisfaction is the soundproofing of the corridor. On the day we stayed, a tenant didn't know the reason. He yelled at the waiter in the corridor at four o'clock in the morning, which woke up our whole family and made me very dissatisfied! ! ! The quality of the guest was simply too low, and I couldn't sleep for one night after that.
The hotel's spr is the most famous, and we didn't experience it with our children this time. The hotel's pools are very comfortable. There are many pools with high and low water temperatures. If you come to stay at the hotel, you must experience it! The swimming pool is not open this time, so I have no experience.
The hotel provides a butler service, which is generally not bad. It may be because I have experienced the butler service of the "Bay Bay Banshan Hot Spring Hotel" in Beijing, so I feel that the service here needs to be improved.
Although there are not many types of breakfast, but because you can also order it for free, the food is still very good. The most important thing is that the waiters in the breakfast room are very enthusiastic and proactive, and the breakfast is provided until 11 o'clock, so the breakfast impressed our family. And good!
I feel that this hotel is suitable for adults to come and relax, rest, take pictures and have a quiet relaxation experience. The hotel is generally very quiet. I personally feel that it is not suitable for children to play. After all, there are slightly less entertainment content suitable for children. This is the "Xiamen Qishang Hotel" I experienced this time.

Nowadays, ordinary coffee shops usually use fresh milk to make froth. It feels that such a high-end hotel should not be appropriate. Secondly, the breakfast is a semi-buffet style. I ordered a beef bagel, but what actually came was not bagel, it was a small hamburger bun, and it hadn't been heated yet. Therefore, it is suggested that the ingredients of Western-style catering in the hotel can be more refined, so as to match the due grade and price. In addition, it is worth mentioning that the taste of Chinese dishes is impressive, especially fried rice with abalone and chicken, the Chinese restaurant is very worthwhile.

msg:The hotel's hardware facilities are complete, the sanitation is acceptable, and the service staff are polite and friendly, but the overall service of the hotel cannot keep up, the management is somewhat chaotic, and the staffing is obviously insufficient.
There are two main points that obviously cannot keep up with the service.
The first room cleaning service is not available: We checked into the hotel on the night of January 29, left the room at 9:00 am on January 30, opened the door at 4:35 pm, and found that the room was not cleaned at all (as shown in Figure 4-5) , After checking that we did not press the Do Not Disturb button by mistake, I immediately called the hotel room service center. The staff who answered the phone had a good attitude. The reason given was that the hotel was too busy and forgot to clean our room. Said that the cleaning staff will be arranged to clean the room later. After hanging up the phone and waiting for 15 minutes, still no cleaning staff came to the room. In the end, we had to go to the lobby to ask for help. There was no staff from the room depar**ent to deal with the problem. We found a male concierge manager with a very good attitude. After listening to the situation, he personally accompanied us back to the room to check the room situation. After finding out that the situation was true, the male manager immediately apologized and promised to contact the room depar**ent to deal with the follow-up issues. Housekeeping didn't arrive until 2 minutes after the concierge manager came to the room. Later, the hotel sent a fruit plate as an apology.
The second breakfast service is not good: half of the breakfast is ordered and half is taken by yourself. The order menu is shown in Figure 6, but the waiting time for the ordered dishes is about 45 to 60 minutes. I also heard many times that the neighbors and waiters reported omissions and reminders, and the guests complained that the service could not keep up.
The service of the noodle stand for breakfast is extremely poor. There are various ingredients on the table. The chef who cooks the noodles does not allow guests to choose their own. The side dishes were used up around 10:30 (as shown in Figures 7 and 8). Some guests reminded the chef to replenish the ingredients. The chef was very impatient and kept complaining that he was too late to cook.

When I returned to the room after dinner in the evening, I found that the slippers had been quietly placed beside the bed, the milk was also placed on the bedside table, and there was a yoga mat for stretching before going to bed, all of which were done without my prior notice. It's already done. I would like to call it the service that moistens everything silently, which is considerate and does not overemphasize existence.
In terms of environment, walking in the hotel, there is a feeling of coming to an art gallery in a trance, which also corresponds to the sentence:
"A good hotel is itself a tourist attraction" ‚Äã.

msg:The last stop of Xiamen trip chose Qishang. I originally planned to stay for two days, but ended up staying for eight days. In the past eight days, I can feel the meticulous care of the staff. From the front desk of the concierge to the aunt who cleans up the chef, their every move made me, a little pregnant woman, feel warm and advanced.

The hotel is located near the airport, and the surrounding business districts are a little away from the hotel. But because of the mask, it's a good place to calm down and rest. Walking in the seaside park, watching the sunrise and sunset, is also very comfortable and comfortable, and the scenery is still very good.

At the beginning, I booked a Harbor King Room. The overall layout is a bit cramped, and it doesn't look very big. But facing the sea and having a terrace, it is quite comfortable to live in. Later, the temperature in Xiamen suddenly dropped, and the central air conditioner was not heating, so the staff helped me arrange a villa suite, so that I could be warmer during pregnancy. Because the location is a bit out of the way, the staff helped me deliver things many times, thank you very much.

I think the food is also very good. I ate the breakfast at the hotel for two days and found it a bit salty. After talking to the front desk, Chef Jiang made me some special meals for pregnant women, which were very delicious. The staff are also very caring. What I look forward to most every day is the breakfast and good night sweet soup, which tastes very good.

And I would like to mention that when I suddenly felt unwell in Xiamen and needed to go to the emergency room, the staff gave me one of the only antigens I bought. Thank you very much.

I lived in Qishang for eight days, and I feel that every staff member is very enthusiastic, thank you very much. Next time I come to Xiamen, I will choose here again.

When I arrived at the hotel, Ms. Sharon at the front desk helped me upgrade the room type, and gave me a welcome fruit, which helped me to delay the check-out. She was very considerate , The view of the hotel is really worth the price. It's a bit dark when you come up from the underground garage at night, and the indicators are not obvious. You can't find the hotel reception. It's also a good choice to have a drink with friends on the balcony at night. The breakfast in the morning is also very good It is humanized until 11:00, which is equivalent to saving the money for breakfast and Chinese food, and the overall price/performance ratio is still high. This time I was in a hurry, and the check-in time was too late, so I didn't get to experience the free spa pool experience, so I will come again

The location of the hotel gives us an innate advantage. Every day at sunrise and sunset, I often read books and drink coffee on the balcony facing the pier. The room size of the city hotel can be 65 square meters, which is indeed very cost-effective, and there is enough lighting. All are great. The SPA is a very big highlight of Qishang. The design inspiration of the sunken classical bathhouse is stunning as soon as the elevator door opens. The different SPA pools, fitness areas, and yoga room areas are all excellent.

The overall design of the hotel's Zhongtong allows the guests to have more environments where they can walk around leisurely. Similarly, the pool area of the western restaurant faces a whole pier.

I have been in contact with the housekeeper on WeChat for three days, and the care is very careful and enthusiastic. As a person's city vacation, this must be a plus point.

Except for breakfast, I personally feel that there are relatively few Western-style choices, the hotel has left a very good impression overall, and it must be on the list of must-stays in Xiamen.

Location and transportation: Wuyuan Bay is far from all scenic spots. You must take a taxi when you go out, but the environment is quiet and it has a more holiday feeling.

Service: I can't keep up with the location and price of the hotel, the check-in arrangement is not appropriate, the waiting time is long and there is no service, you can give a cup of tea first, instead of pouring tea when you go to the front desk to go through the formalities... Welcome fruit after follow-up Finally delivered to the room at night... I forgot the sugar water in the evening

Room view: I booked a one-bedroom in the harbor, which is worth paying more for the price. The landscape can be said to be invincible. You can see a beautiful panoramic harbor view from any angle of the room. David Beckham had stayed at this hotel, but he had a suite, which was bigger.

Room facilities: high-quality TV, audio and video equipment, Loewe's TV, B&O's bluetooth speaker, electric curtains will automatically rise when entering the room, which is quite ceremonial, and the bathroom is equipped with a shower and a bathtub for use. Lighting control is also a little thoughtful. The sound insulation effect of the room is good. This five-star hotel, especially the resort hotel, must pay attention to the quiet environment to rest well.

Hotel facilities: The products of Chinese and Western restaurants are all good. The semi-buffet breakfast is eaten in Western food. The variety of self-service is quite rich, and there are a la carte eggs and salads, which are very good and full. The Chinese restaurant is well-known locally and is also an online celebrity shop. The swimming pool is outdoor. Fortunately, during the National Day, it is above 30 degrees during the day, so you can swim. In the afternoon, go to the gym to check in. In addition, there are Spa, dry, wet steam and massage pools. The facilities are very complete and meet the needs of resort guests.

Overall, the service still has room for improvement, but the hardware can be said to be full marks, and it is one of the best hotels in Xiamen.

Breakfast: There are not many self-service choices, but there are many types of self-orders, and the products are also very good. Eggs Benedict, muffins, and bagels have not stepped on the thunder.

Service: All the staff in this hotel are super polite and good service, especially the manager Momoco, who is very caring from check-in to check-out.
Spa pool experience: It's a pity that I didn't experience it because it was inconvenient for my body.
All in all, the hotel is super suitable for couples, business and friends. If you have children, the children will have less to play.

msg:LHW Group has three hotels in China, all of which are called **hotel & spa. Happened to live in two of them for the past two months. One is Beijing Puxuan and the other is Qishang. I didn't know it at first, until I found out that the light button, faucet, and bathtub were almost the same as Beijing Puxuan, and I found out that it was the same model.
Back to the topic, the design sense of Qishang is okay, especially the lighting. The sunset shines on some rooms (should be the harbor), like laying a layer of gold on the room, which is full of brilliance. As soon as you enter the hotel, there is a faint scent of sandalwood, which can be seen to be a little bit of Zen that you want to create a holiday.
The good impression of this hotel comes from the housekeeper Aiden. He has been answering questions since the first half month of my stay, and he also recommended some projects I want. It really depends on the locals to avoid pits ( reliable). For example, the "minibar" you see on the booking website is actually free for the hotel guests. So if you are interested in staying, I strongly recommend to communicate with the hotel directly.
When I left the store, I wrote a short sentence to the hotel: "The design warms the eyes, and the service warms the heart" and gave it to our housekeeper, Aiden. Hope he is still there next time I check in, hahaha.

‚ÄãFrom arrival at the hotel to check-in, the whole process of escort service, super long bar, half of it is the front desk, half of which is available for guests to order and afternoon tea, the a**osphere is full~~
‚ÄãThe little brother in the concierge accompany the whole process to check in and bring it to the room. He carefully and carefully introduced the performance and use of the room, and introduced the location and time of the hotel's various facilities along the way. The room is very intelligent, the bathroom is spacious, and the bathtub is super large! I like the bedding of his family, it is silky and soft, the hotel with balcony, the balcony of the room, and the oversized sofa can fully satisfy the stay of 2 adults and 2 children. The phone in the room will be forwarded by the housekeeper, saving unnecessary harassment.
Milk and sweet soup will be delivered every night at night, and the fruit every day is really delicious, hehe.
The next day, for the convenience of going to the city, I changed the Conrad of the Twin Towers, and moved back after one night. incomparable [good]
Checked in again, purchased a package with spa, sailboat and afternoon tea for two people. Due to the epidemic, I changed my booking. I would like to thank the hotel guest manager for cooperating with the refund and modification throughout the whole process. There is no extra charge. I would also like to express my gratitude to King Chen, who has been taking the trouble to help. As for the hotel's breakfast, I can only say that children who don't like breakfast are full of praise.

msg:This trip on the second anniversary of the wedding deliberately discussed with my husband that we want to choose Xiamen, because this is the place where we traveled for the first time when we fell in love, and it is very memorable. I usually choose the hotel when I go out to play. When I saw Qishang, I thought it was a particularly suitable place for the couple to relax.
Transportation: It takes about half an hour from Xiamen North Railway Station to the hotel. It is easy to take a taxi. Basically, the special car can reach the hotel entrance within 3 minutes.

Hygiene: I don't pay too much attention to the details, I deliberately look for unclean places, and there is no problem with my stay

Environment: Needless to say, the environment of Qishang Hotel is the best option. I love the balcony here, and my husband also likes it. Sitting here, I can't hear the hustle and bustle of the city, and I can't see the passing vehicles, only the garden view and the five bays in the distance. Can really feel the word "vacation"

Service: The hotel steward will add WeChat, and you can ask them if you have any needs. Here I would like to thank my housekeeper Clarie, who added me to WeChat the night before the trip, asked my needs and reminded me of the temperature in Xiamen. When I learned that my husband and I were here for the festival, we not only upgraded our room for two nights, but also made a special romantic arrangement. I said that the hotel is really more ceremonial than my husband, hahahaha.
Every staff member greets guests warmly. When we checked out and left the hotel, we really felt the "Qi Shang" level hotel service from beginning to end. So much so that my husband and I said that I wanted to be quarantined in Qishang (just a joke) I also love the breakfast here

Come to Xiamen again, it is still Qishang!

msg:When traveling with children, pay special attention to the quality of the hotel. The family carefully selected Qishang, which turned out to be the perfect choice.
Environment: The public space of the hotel is really elegant, one step at a time, it has the style of modern fusion of new Chinese style, the light and shadow are scattered, and it looks good no matter how you take it. The lobby is very distinctive, with the afterglow of the sunset reflecting on the window grilles, giving you a warm feeling of slow time. The room is symmetrical, simple, well-equipped and considerate. There are also many collections and furnishings. It is said that it is very valuable. If you travel with a leather monkey baby, you must be careful. The middle of the bed faces the large French windows and balcony (some people may not be comfortable sleeping in this position).
Service: The manager on duty and the housekeeper are very considerate, and the staff who arrive at the store all smile very well, especially Shirley, who is very impressed. We ordered the Wuyuanwan sailboat to go out to sea, and the staff who guided us specially took us there (very close and only a few minutes walk). In the evening, the hotel also sent a good night soup, which was very pleasant.
Dining & SPA: We tried the hotel's buffet breakfast and Chinese restaurant. There are not many kinds of breakfast, but it is exquisite and tastes good. Scrambled eggs are especially delicious. Chinese dishes have a feel that combines innovative dishes with traditional flavors, and the taste is very good. In particular, I am most impressed with the Haihuang Explosion Rice, which is sweet and delicious, loved by adults and children, the shrimp is big and Q, the soup is very fresh, and the fragrant rice inside is just right. The pre-dinner snacks are also good. The dishes we ordered are still very tasty. The steamed chicken is very tender, the wagyu soup dumplings are very refreshing, and the dessert peanut soup is soft and melts in the mouth, and the taste is really outstanding. If there are many people, the portion of the dishes will be a little small, but it is just right for a family outing. The experience is very good.
I didn't have time to experience the soup, the SPA felt very comfortable, and the elders were full of praise. The warm reclining chairs in the rest area are even more unique. Lying down and looking at the water and scenery in the garden, you can squinting at once, feeling that it can cure the rush and fatigue in life. love it here!
Because we mainly took a leisurely vacation this time. When it was not hot, we walked in the park and bubbled in the hotel. Overall, we enjoyed it very much. The surrounding area is Wuyuanwan Wharf. In addition to going out to sea in the evening, there is a musical fountain in the square at night, which children like very much. Xiamen is so beautiful, Qishang is so comfortable, I will come again if I have the chance.

There are sofas, capsule coffee machines, and Dyson hair dryers in the interior and balcony. No other hardware is used, so I won't comment. I have tried the hotel Chinese restaurant, Long Bar, and gym. The Chinese restaurant is a bit expensive, the gym is a bit small, and the bar and the front desk are not connected enough for privacy. Then there is the location. Although it is quiet and suitable for vacation, it will be boring after a long stay. One night experience is enough. In terms of design sense and holiday a**osphere, I personally feel that Qiandao Lake Intercontinental is comparable to it.

There are also chairs at the end of the bed where you can sit and drink tea and watch TV and watch the clouds. I like it very much. The detail design is very good. I like the kettle very much. It is small and exquisite and feels good in the hand. Great experience, great spa! My daughter and I both love it! In the evening, I went to the pier for a walk. It is close to the airport high-speed rail. I will come to live next time. Like üòò!

msg:On my friend's birthday, I came to Xiamen after a long absence. After struggling with several hotels, I finally chose Qishang. I have to say that Qishang also met my expectations for this hotel. The concealment of the entrance improves the style of the hotel, and the decoration inside can be seen to be very attentive. I bought the hotel package and got afternoon tea and a 60-minute double massage. The experience is very good. The only regret is that the afternoon tea is eaten in the lobby. In terms of breakfast, the level of food is good, but I think the choice is a bit small, but the service staff are very conscientious and responsible. I would like to praise Marry here for taking special care of customers. I stayed in this hotel for three nights in total. I changed from a garden view room to a harbor room. I am very satisfied with the size of the room. It is worth mentioning that the hotel will prepare a cup of drinks every night, and it will also change to a different style. If I come to Xiamen next time, I will still choose Qishang‚ù§Ô∏è

Service: very good üëå. There are many people in the hotel, and you can always find someone to ask if you have any questions. When I went to the SPA area, I didn't know how to get there. Before I asked, a staff member came to guide me. The little sister who checked in was also very thoughtful, the tea was delicious, and the little sister led the way when I went to the room, which was very considerate.

Environment: very good. And the sandalwood used in the hotel smells so good! 100 points! Although breakfast can't be brought into the room, it is also excellent to go downstairs to eat while watching the beautiful scenery.

Supplement 1: When checking out, the lady at the front desk also reported that the shampoo in the hotel is really bad, and it feels like the level of a fast hotel (although the lady said the cost is not low), it is recommended that you bring your own shampooüò©, otherwise hair The knotted frizz is unbelievably dry. üò¢I washed my hair during the day, but when I had to wash my hair after swimming at night, I really didn‚Äôt dare to use shampoo again, so I applied conditioner directly, but my hair was still indescribable. .

When I booked the hotel, I made a note with my husband for the 9th anniversary, to see if I could help arrange some rooms with a view of the sea, because basically many hotels were full during the summer vacation, so I didn‚Äôt expect it to be possible. Unexpectedly, as soon as I arrived at the hotel, susan and front office manager Momoco helped me directly upgrade the harbor room, which was full of surprises! When I entered the room later, I found the ceremony they did for us. I was really touched! In China, I have stayed in hundreds of hotels, and this is the first time I have been touched.
We ate two meals in the hotel in a row, the Chinese restaurant in the hotel, the taste is very good, comparable to the Michelin restaurant, and the service is very good, recommended!
Later, because the return time was temporarily changed, I wanted to pay for a late check-out, but Shirley helped us to delay the check-out for free.
I basically don't review hotels on Ctrip, but the hotel, whether in terms of service or environment, reveals luxury in a low-key way, and beats more than 5,000 hotels in Hainan. The feeling is really great!

The design team, LAYAN, Australia, is responsible for the operation. Full of hidden luxury, the more you live, the more you can feel her escapist and luxurious a**osphere. The aesthetics is the new Chinese style in southern Fujian. A large number of local famous handmade woodcarvings, such as the seven hanging wolf carving pillars at the entrance, implicitly express the seven wolves of their gold masters!
Lobby exterior wall lotus wood carving and rare pincushion flowers, lobby furniture from Hermes. Everywhere is beautiful... The paintings in the lobby have a market value of over 30 million.

Open the balcony door to enjoy the super-beautiful harbour viewüåÉThe hardware is extremely luxurious, and the TV is as beautiful as a work of art. It comes from LOEWE in Germany, and it is also the top luxury in TV. The glass sliding door with Sijuan in the bathroom is beautiful in light and shadow. AXOR bathroom, PG aluminum stone bathtub, TOTO automatic, Dyson hair dryer, Diptyque toiletries, all the top luxury brands are assembled. The lighting system is superbly designed, with a single knob to call up a variety of lighting.
The minibar in the room is completely free, and there are many imported snacks and drinks, among which the tea bag BASAO and Deyun milk are very popular in my heartü•õ
There are a lot of interactive classes. We recommend singing bowls and sound healing SPA. It transmits sound vibrations to the body and mind, and relaxes and releases stress. It is quite mysterious! The gym is not big, but the equipment is the best with Rogaine and Technogym I have seen. The outdoor outdoor swimming pool is tropical resort style, ideal for lying flat, 50 meters long.
In addition to the long bar and the tea room, there are also two restaurants üç¥AMOY Western Restaurant, which are simple, transparent, rigid and soft, and have breakfast here. XIA Chinese restaurant, 880,000 southern Fujian red bricks achieve extremely symmetrical beauty! The dishes are exquisite and well presented. I especially like tableware. The texture of Qishang has been rated as "the most beautiful sunset hotel" many times. It is recommended to watch the hotel's "sunset ceremony" yuan, but only every Friday and Saturday eveningüåÜ
But I like the most beautiful night view after dinner! Absolute child! The ultimate interpretation of light and shadow art, the art that has been polished for many years, every part is moving! I am a hotel controller, and Jason and I have the honor to experience it for free today, thank you üôè

Room Facilities:

    The sanitation area is also very good, the toiletries are Tiptik, which is really rich, the hair dryer is Dyson, and the variety of drinks in the mini bar is also very rich.

Cost-effective:
   The price/performance ratio is really good, and I have stayed in many high-priced hotels at home and abroad. Qishang has given us a great experience.

breakfast:
   The breakfast variety is very rich, both Western and Chinese, not only in quantity, but also in good quality. It is said that there was a breakfast room service in the past, but now it has been cancelled. Unfortunately, I wanted to have breakfast while looking at the sea.

The best experience is Qishang Hotel, which has a beautiful balcony. Beautiful, the room is also relatively large, the most plus point is the hotel's butler service, which gives people a feeling of being at home, especially the housekeeper Momoco, who is very attentive and deserves a big compliment! The breakfast is also very good, although there are no more varieties than other hotels, but everything is exquisite, so there are many choices, unlike some five-star hotel breakfasts, which have a wide variety of varieties, giving people a false prosperity, but there is really little to eat , I will choose Qishang next time I go to Xiamen.

msg:When I talked to the housekeeper on the phone before check-in, I told me that I wanted to check in early (the housekeeper said that the normal check-in is 3:00) and that all rooms were arranged on the same floor. The housekeeper also politely replied that he would try his best to arrange it.
When I checked in, it rained heavily in Xiamen because of the tail of the typhoon. It was originally a 20-minute journey from Jimei to the hotel, but the flooded roads were impassable everywhere, and I walked for more than 2 hours. When I arrived at the hotel at 4:30, the front desk said that only two rooms were cleaned. I tried to say that the child was uncomfortable because of the traffic jam, and the check-in time was delayed by more than 2 hours. Can you give me all the rooms. The lady at the front desk checked the computer and told me that she could give me 4 rooms on different floors. I agreed. During the process of entering the room card by the lady at the front desk, another guest came to check in. In front of me, Mr. *** at the front desk next door said to the lady who was applying for the card for me, "I want these two rooms, you can cancel it." Then the lady who was making the room card could only stop Next, give him the room. God knows how shocked I was. The rude and unreasonable behavior of Mr. ***, I have never encountered such treatment in any hotel of the same type that uses "escaping luxury travel" as a promotional point.
1. I am a guest and I don‚Äôt know the internal work, but I should ask for my consent when I openly robbed the room during the card making process; 2. There is only one table between the check-in and the front desk, so undisguised. Are the loud conversations trying to tell me I don't deserve this room?
I immediately expressed my dissatisfaction and doubts, at which point the check-in process was over 20 minutes. The lady at the front desk magically arranged all the rooms on the same floor for me. It has been more than half an hour waiting for the card to be prepared.
The hotel butler later told me on WeChat that he knew the little twists and turns during check-in, and sent a red wine to the room. (Because I said in advance that there is an anniversary, I don‚Äôt know if it belongs to the spare parts given to the guests on the anniversary or it is specially used for apology.)
Seriously, because of Mr. ***'s attitude and hospitality, I probably wouldn't have the will to stay here again.

Let's talk about some suggestions for the hotel:
1. It is dirty to step on the room with bare feet;
2. Although the double bed room is a bit more expensive, the bed is really small (this time the children are s***ping, and the bed in the double bed room is very comfortable and very large), and it is also very small, not to mention adult men;
3. There is a spider web next to the bed in the twin room;
4. The uniforms worn by each staff member in the breakfast room are different, and it is impossible to identify who should be asked for a cup of black tea;
5. The rainy days in Xiamen are so continuous, and there is no standard umbrella in the room. I asked the concierge to borrow it, but the answer was that it was finished;
6. The bubble pool in the spa is very comfortable, both the hardware bubble pool and the staff make people feel like spring breeze;
7. Thank you very much for the anniversary arrangement for my room in advance. It can be seen that the hotel really wants to do a good job. If you make any comments, you will immediately be very humble and patient, but the good attitude is not in place and cannot be implemented. A good attitude is just a fake.

msg:Nice hotel, built near the sea, with southern Fujian style and excellent hardware.
The front desk and bar, the view is super good, very a**ospheric, very comfortable;
The chef of XIA Chinese restaurant has a lot of ideas. Minnan has made some changes, and it tastes very comfortable;
The spa service is also good, and the massage techniques are basically five-star;
There is a huge bridal shop XIPHOTO hidden downstairs.
Not enough-
Spa is a place where man and nature are one, but it is arranged underground, giving up the feeling of beauty and the oneness of man and nature, and luxurious decoration has become a shortcoming;
The swimming pool is very narrow, which is not a problem, but there is no light-proof design, which is really hard in places like Xiamen. In addition, swimming goggles and swimming caps are recommended to be rented (rather than sold at high prices), which is the top service in Wenhua. Hotels are arranged;
The equipment in the gym is a little too crowded, and the air is a little worse.

üçÉEnvironment: The hotel next to the Wuyuanwan yacht marinaüè®, the environment needs no introduction.
In addition to the location, the hotel's features include the hotel's artistic and cultural design, and every detail is pleasing to the eye.
The hotel's Chinese restaurant is also highly recommended, and the quality of the dishes is excellent.

When I am on vacation, there will be a welcome tea when I check in at the parking lot, and someone will bring it to the room to help with luggage. Refreshments were prepared on the day of check-in, and milk was prepared by the bedside before going to bedü•õ I felt the warmth from the snail girl before going back to the room. During breakfast, a waiter will put a tablecloth on your lap, but the second I didn‚Äôt enjoy it on the third day, haha. It should be because there are too many people in the time period. The overall service level is good, but there is no sense of fault. You send it to the elevator and press the elevator to get off the parking lot. Before going there, I actually saw that the restaurant in the hotel didn't show any food star rating. I was still thinking that there was nothing to eat, but when I actually went, the design of the restaurant was very good. The style, the service is very good, I will put napkins for you, listen to me saying that the stomach is uncomfortable, and recommend suitable meals to see myself and bring me a magazine. The ingredients are delicious, I recommend it. It is the first time to write so much hahaha. Of course there are also It can be in the perfect place, the kettle for making tea will be hot.

Booked the harbor sea view room, the room was very spacious. Facilities are complete. The scenery on the balcony is amazing. It is very comfortable to sit here and drink a little wine and blow the sea breeze at night. Turn down the service, but also send yoga mats or something.
There are only two points: 1. The water in such a big bathtub is too cold. The water flow rate is normal, but the water is too cold. Be sure to turn up some heat, after all, it is a bath. 2. Bluetooth speakers are inconvenient to use, and you need to download an app to connect.

breakfast:
During the epidemic, breakfast was delivered to the room. The experience will be a little bit worse, such as asking for toast but not baking it, simple soy sauce paste, but no black pepper.

restaurant:
The environment of the Chinese restaurant is very good and the food is exquisite. There is also a 10% discount for in-house guests.

Room view:
The view of the room is the invincible Wuyuanwan sea view. At night, the colors change with the lights.

Serve:
The service is very considerate and in place. Makes people feel at home.
Gym:
The gym is unguarded at 10 o'clock in the evening. I left at 11 o'clock. The lights are dark, so leave a light for me. The gym is a bit smaller, but it has all the necessary equipment. As a resort hotel , is also sufficient. The running track next to the hotel and the wetland park are very suitable for vacation.

Cost-effective:
The overall value for money is good, and you get what you pay for. Worth the price. I hope that the epidemic is over, or summer comes, and next time I can experience the Italian restaurant and the facilities of the swimming pool.

msg:I read some information about the hotel before coming
The team has created a unique southern Fujian aesthetic style after ten years
As soon as you enter, you are attracted by the century-old lychee tree at the door.
There are a lot of symmetrical elements in the overall design, and the environment is elegant
A hotel especially suitable for relaxation
The room is spacious enough and the balcony can see the garden and the sea
But the good impression only lasted for half a day. After getting up the next day, it disappeared instantly. First of all, it was a hundred bags of fleas or something on my feet.
At first I thought it was a mosquito bite, but I found out that this number is unlikely to be mosquitoes, but appeared overnight
Then the hotel's breakfast is very worthy of complaining. I chose several samples to try and can be delivered to the room, which is more intimate but! Three of the local specialties are very unpalatable. Even the salad is unpalatable. It's better to buy some fruit.
The service standards advertised by the hotel are some useless formal work. After I gave them a lot of improvement suggestions, I did not get good follow-up feedback. It can reflect that the level of management personnel is still very basic.

Overall the price is 5 star price The environment and design is 5 star
The breakfast is at the level of the hostel, the service level is around the level of the three-star Vienna, the overall level is flashy, and there is no sense of intimacy

The breakfast was delicious, and the minibar drinks and snacks were sincere. The butler service was considerate and took the initiative to help me delay the check-out time. The only downside is that the hotel seemed to be under renovation on the night I stayed, it was after 1 am, and the workers were still making loud noises, accompanied by the sound of sand shoveling, which made it even more difficult for me, who was not sleeping well, to fall asleep. I hope the hotel will strengthen its management. It is a pity that such a secluded and quiet hotel is so noisy late at night. In view of the perfect experience in other aspects, I still give full encouragement and hope that this will not happen when I stay in Xiamen next time.

msg:I stayed in a hotel that is said to be the top hotel in Xiamen... I don‚Äôt know if I was lucky or too lucky. In the first room of the hotel, the guests upstairs moved their chairs and ran around. I could hear it clearly. Isn‚Äôt that what an exclusive hotel should do? When we arrived at Jingma, the manager responded quickly and adjusted the room. After changing the room, we had dinner. We returned to the hotel in the evening to prepare for a rest, but it turned out to be really confusing... We stayed in Shuiliandong. This is what I said. I sent someone to check it out. The design problem could not be solved, and there was no reply until after 11 o'clock, so we reluctantly fell asleep in the environment of Shuilian Cave. Little did we know that after 12 o'clock, the hotel called us and the call was disconnected as soon as we answered it. We called back and the hotel replied that there might be a wrong call. This is not the end yet... The breakfast items were not served after 11 o'clock. Finally, after 11 o'clock, the waiter came over and said, "I'm sorry, sir, you don't have the ingredients for what you ordered. I even asked for watermelon juice several times." ...I was too lazy to complain at that time, and the manager‚Äôs solution was to send us to the next hotel. I ordered a Didi private car for 6 kilometers... What a bad experience... I wasted such a beautiful hotel... The hotel needs training to solve problems. Compensation is to give the guests what they want, not what you want to give. We will give it to you next time. Saying hello to the room is completely meaningless because the experience is already so bad. How can I stay there next time? Late check-out As long as I apply for a hotel, can I not have late check-out? Service comes from the heart, not fake and illusory "compensation"

At 8:30, there will be a bed service, the mattress will be made, and a bowl of hot peach gum white fungus will be given. The hotel's Chinese restaurant is also commendable, maintaining the hotel's high quality standards, it is worth a try. It can be said that the service of the spa is very meticulous and thoughtful, and the effect is also very good. After the trea**ent, the body and mind are relaxed, and the facial condition is very good. There will be hot tea and snacks at the beginning and end of the wait.
The hotel has a free minibar, snacks include butter nuts and a pack of Hershey chocolates, and drinks include milk, juice and beer.
Everywhere you go, you can feel the hotel's full of intentions, and it is difficult to pick out faults.

3. The design of the hotel is very Zen, the inves**ent is high, and it has a sense of design. All the rooms are not on the road, and the rooms are very quiet.
4. The bath water is very stable and large.
5. The sound insulation of the room is good, and the hair dryer can't hear you when you talk, except for the screaming and crying of the children.
6. Toiletries are not bad, dp's.
7. Parking is convenient, the surrounding landscape is very good, next to the wetland park and the luxury residential area, it has the feeling of Macau.
8. The croissants for breakfast and the shrimps for the noodles are delicious.
9. Breakfast can be delivered for free 24 hours a day. This service is very considerate and suitable for friends who get up late.
10. The cleaning of the rooms is very serious. Every day I can hear the sound of vacuuming upstairs and the sound of chairs moving. Some hotels do not vacuum when they are busy during the Chinese New Year. Bed linen is changed every 2 days. Although we do not choose to be more environmentally friendly, such requirements are still very high standards.
Next, let‚Äôs talk about the shortcomings and suggestions:
1. I heard that the management of the hotel is a domestic management company. First of all, I said that it is not easy.
2. I feel that there is a problem with the management of the hotel.
3. In the western restaurant and Chinese restaurant, the waiters all wear masks, and the management does not wear masks.
4. Chef management, and foreign chefs do not wear masks, but also come out to the restaurant to interact with guests. The management of the Chinese kitchen also does not wear masks, and still looks at the mobile phone during work.
5. I gave advice to the front desk, and the receptionist told me that we have low risk here, but during the epidemic, low risk does not mean no risk, right? A hotel is a small community, isn't the first task of a hotel to ensure the safety of guests? During breakfast, the receptionist at the door also had a leader who did not wear a mask. The front desk does not prepare masks or distribute masks to guests who come in to eat, let alone remind guests to wear masks or not speak loudly when picking up meals.
6. There are not many varieties of breakfast in general, and the salad is comparable to that of Hangzhou Aman. On the first day, there were no green leaves at all. The salad vegetable clips are very small and keep sliding into the basin, and there is no tray to put the clips outside the basin, which is very unhygienic, and it is really rough.
7. The room should be designed by the designer according to the double bed room, so the design of the double bed room is a bit strange. The bed was very small and short, and the TV was too far away to see clearly. It felt like watching a 20" TV in a big room. And the hotel reflects that the hotel informs that this TV is the most famous brand. Excuse me, isn't the most basic purpose of television to be seen? Isn't the goal of higher pixels for TV amplification? With this defect, you can prepare a projector for the guests! The solution the hotel can give us is to give us more stools.
If we report a smell in the room, don't we provide an air purifier? Are you giving us some stools to sit on the balcony?
8. The outdoor corridor of the hotel is a big feature. After nine o'clock in the evening, there is no service, and you can't spend it outdoors. I hope it can be improved.
9. There will be staff sitting on the phone at the elevator entrance of the guest room. Cleaning or food delivery staff will speak in the aisle. Because of the glass on one side of the aisle, the echo will be particularly loud. There is noise into the room.
10. Is the gym too small? Such advanced fitness equipment is crowded into such a small room. In such a room, a maximum of 2 people exercise at a time, and there will be discomfort when there are too many people.
11. Service attitude, inner love for the hotel. I feel that my hotel's great self-confidence and the professional service sense to the guests can be well coordinated, rather than a self-confidence and pride that makes people feel. True self-confidence is the self-confidence that knows how to bow. It is recommended to learn the service spirit and service concept from the old foreign brands.
Hope our domestic brands can also have good boutique sustainable brand hotels.

The modern and minimalist decoration suits my taste very much. The minibar and the refrigerator are all free. Breakfast Also quite yyds, especially the fried oysters made the baby very satisfied. Pools etc. are also quite good.
‚óèDisadvantages: The geographical location is relatively remote, you basically take a taxi when you go out, and there is nothing delicious around. But you can order takeout, or try their Chinese restaurant, which tastes good. There is a discount for in-house guests.

msg:After experiencing the baptism of the soft waves of Gulangyu Island on Qin Island, I returned to Xiamen and stayed at Qishang Hotel. I was moved by the hotel's light and luxurious design and the natural scenery of the bay. At night, you will fall into a dream with Yingyingboguang, and in the morning, you will be awakened by the faint morning light and integrated into a new world. The caring housekeeper Queeny and the guest room Amber gave caring tour guides to Xiamen. They were full of the amazing bread crabs in the eight cities. They didn't want to leave a single slag on the plate. Unfortunately, there was no real bread, so they could help to lick the delicious food on the plate. The taste of Iron Arhat, who represents the pride of Fujian people, is as tasteful as the service level of Qishang Hotel, with love and affection. It also maintains the appropriate level of restraint and respect, representing a truly international level. The art solo exhibition of Mr. Wu Zhenguan that I met by chance has the mystery of oriental art and the abstraction of western art. The installation is also a**ospheric and soft. The lacquer and ramie are used to express the artistic conception through metal foil. The trip to Xiamen Qishang is indeed like a "trance" The title is beautiful and trance, and the memory is long!

msg:You get what you pay for, great hotel, good value for money. The hotel is said to be among the top three in Xiamen. Outside the hotel is Wuyuanwan Harbour, and it takes 5-10 minutes to walk to the yacht and sailing experience port. The mini bar in the room has a wide variety of beer, milk, carbonated drinks, juice, and sparkling mineral water. The shaver is paired with a real cleansing foam, which is easy to use. The breakfast is semi-buffet, rich in content, especially with chili sauce, not Xiamen sweet and chili sauce, and breakfast is 7-11 o'clock, you can go to brunch directly after sleeping in. This price is matched as a whole. If economic strength allows, you must stay in Xiamen for one day. Start with a one-bedroom in the harbor, contact the hotel in advance to ask for the highest floor, look directly at the sea, and sail directly to the sea the next day.

msg:üò°This is the first time I have stayed in a five-star hotel with such poor service attitude! We booked four rooms. When we first arrived to check in, we were sitting on the sofa next to the reception desk waiting to check in. A waiter came over and told us we couldn't sit here! This is a seat reserved for afternoon tea! ? Is this the best hotel in Xiamen? There is no place in the lobby for people checking in to wait! Afternoon tea is served in the middle of the lobby? With so many people in our four rooms, we could only stand less than one meter away and watch them drink afternoon tea. If I were an afternoon tea drinker, I would be very uncomfortable booking this kind of seat! Also, are we, the guests who have booked four rooms, inferior to those who have booked afternoon tea? Don‚Äôt we deserve to sit on the sofa in your lobby? The front desk told us that there is currently only one room out of the four rooms we booked? It‚Äôs past three in the afternoon! We only got one room, so forget it. Maybe during the recent peak travel period, rooms are tight, and we all understand.
When we returned to the hotel at 7pm to get the remaining three room cards and went to the first room to get our luggage, the card in the first room actually couldn't be swiped to open the door? So we called the front desk to open the door, but we waited at the door of the room for 15-20 minutes before someone came. There were more than a dozen people who had just come back from playing outside. They were all sweaty and had no room to tidy up. The corridor of the five-star hotel was at 35 The weather is so hot that there is no air conditioning? May I ask why it takes more than ten minutes to walk from the front desk to the room? Is it necessary to temporarily transfer a waiter from Qishang headquarters to open the door for us? After we reported this matter to the front desk manager, the front desk manager's response to us was that he had monitored the situation and saw that we only waited at the door of the room for 5-10 minutes? The time interval between calls recorded in our own mobile phone records is 11 minutes. It takes at least three or four minutes from the beginning of the incident to the arrival of the waiter... Also, I don‚Äôt know why you are bothering us about this. , even if it really didn‚Äôt take more than 10 minutes, it doesn‚Äôt excuse the fact that you waited for 10 minutes for the front desk to open the door when you couldn‚Äôt swipe the two cards at your hotel to open the room! What's more, there are at least 15 minutesüò°üò°üò°We also ordered dinner at 8 o'clock, and the preparation time we had reserved was completely disrupted!
Later, we discovered that two of the last three room cards given to us by the front desk were the same. Our person went to the front desk to change the cards. The front desk didn't understand and gave us the same three cards back? The second room is a suite with two bedrooms and one living room, right?
The front desk manager said that he would ask the hotel manager to visit the next day. We waited until three o'clock in the afternoon and saw no one. This is the service attitude of Xiamen First Hotel, the attitude of solving problems, right?

Let's talk about Xiaomei from the housekeeping depar**ent, thank you for preparing all kinds of surprises for our wedding so carefully! Thanks to a thin and tall little brother in the food and beverage depar**ent, I'm sorry, I can't name it for a while. When we had breakfast, I came here several times to care about whether it was up to our appetite, the food recommended by the chef, etc. It was a good feeling to be taken seriously. The other staff in the front office are also very good. The flower tea delivered at check-in is delicious. The little girl who guided us to the room was also very nice and introduced the hotel's facilities and location responsibly. When checking out, the lobby manager directly greeted us and asked us if we wanted to check out, and also cared about the feeling of staying, and later gave us a souvenir. It's a very perfect Ending! A hotel that makes people feel unsatisfied. Although many staff members do not know the names, please add chicken thighs to all of them üçó! ! ! !

msg:I went to university locally in Xiamen, and I came to pull the ****s with my friends after the final exam. The hotel I always wanted to stay in but didn‚Äôt have time to stay in, it happened to be very close to the airport.

First of all, in general, I think Qishang is among the best and most worthy hotels in Xiamen. To be honest, many hotels in Xiamen are overpriced, like Conrad, which is located on the seaside of the Twin Towers, but Qishang, also located on the seaside, has done much better in every aspect.

I am most satisfied with the facilities and services. Dyson's hair dryer, Loewe's TV, BO's Bluetooth stereo, PG's custom bathtub, La Bottega's toiletries and more, as well as 24-hour butler service. (And its own aromatherapy! Every time I smell it, I am very happy)

Secondly, the decoration of the hotel and the food. The furniture in the lobby is a brand hotel owned by Herm√®s. There is a large lychee tree at the entrance. In the hearts of southern Fujian people, the lychee tree is a symbol of beauty and prosperity. The hotel integrates Minnan culture and modern culture very well! As for the food, I won't go into details, there are various kinds, the taste is just right, and there is nothing to be picky about.

If time permits, you can also experience various seaside activities in Xiawuyuan Bay.

In a word, the thoughtfulness, high-end and convenience displayed in every part of the hotel can be said to have brought me a super good stay experience! Come back next semester!

msg:In early December, we decided to choose a hotel that is particularly suitable for anniversaries and spend an unforgettable golden wedding anniversary. We carefully compared and selected from many five-star hotels in Xiamen and chose Xiamen Qishang Hotel.
After a one-day stay experience on the 26th, we found that we really chose Qishang. This day will never be forgotten by us! I can't help but share it with you:
1. Service: warm and considerate service like family. 1. Queeny, the housekeeper supervisor, began to communicate with me seriously more than ten days before check-in, understand my wife's preferences, and even asked about our favorite bedding...2. We felt full of joy and happiness from the moment we entered Qishang Hotel! The girl named Chen at the front desk sent us to the guest room all the time, and Manager Ye of the housekeeping depar**ent met us at the entrance of the room. When we opened the door of the guest room, we saw 9 footprints drawn by rose petals on the ground, and 50 candles in the heart-shaped plum petals in front (see video); greeting cards carefully written by handsome men and beautiful women in the guest rooms on the long table on one side, I LOVE U a**osphere lights; red wedding dresses and silver crowns on white sheets; the background music of "When You Are Old" sung by Karen Mok was played on TV. My wife couldn't help but say it was so beautiful. Chen Xiaodan from the housekeeping depar**ent played the video I made on the TV in the room; later I learned that all the cartoon cards in the guest room were hand-painted by Chen Xiaodan. I opened the album on the small table (Picture 8) and then I understood why Queeny asked me to send some photos to her. It turned out that she and housekeeper Huang Lilin had edited a commemorative album with our photos over the past ten days. Each photo had Queeny and Huang Lilin's beautiful words. Lin Lan, who once worked on the Royal Caribbean cruise ship, might have used Genie in Aladdin's magic lamp to mobilize many employees of Qishang Hotel to work together, which moved us so much. You Meichai from the guest room carefully prepared a large bathtub for us, and said when she left: Call me at any time if you need anything. Butler Li Jinhua arranged a warm candlelight dinner (Picture 6), and after the meal Queeny also presented a bouquet of flowers and a golden wedding certificate. After the meal, when I was lying on the slate bed at the SPA, a girl brought me lotus seed and red date soup. When I returned to the room, I saw a bottle of wine and 2 bowls of mung bean soup on the small table... During breakfast, the hotel's general manager Mo Yongquan came to our table and asked us how we slept? What other requirements and opinions did we have? During the conversation, I learned that the handsome and capable Mr. Mo is from the Bai ethnic group in Dali; perhaps the Bai ethnic group's family-like hospitality style infected the employees. We left a lot of happy memories on our golden wedding anniversary at Qishang! 
2. Environment: The upgraded room faces the harbor of Xiamen Wuyuanwan Yacht Marina, the blue sea outside the balcony, the landscape lights that change colors at the yacht marina at night, and the swimming pool of the hotel downstairs... 3. Facilities: The room has smart lighting, electric curtains, and smart toilets, full of low-key luxury; the 288***-meter SPA on the first floor has a variety of water flow pools and electric stone beds. The whole hotel is fresh, comfortable and quiet. For vacations and various anniversaries, you can't go wrong with Qishang!

In addition, I don't know what room card system they are. It is very inconvenient to have to re-create the room card every day.

The hardware is good, but the service really needs to be improved.

Very pleasantly surprised to upgrade the sea view room from the standard room...Thanks to the butler Amy and Jennie,
Hotel with balcony, facing the sea, Zen space, very comfortable. The most comfortable bed I have ever lived in, with its own TV stereo, Dyson hair dryer, B&O bluetooth speaker, coffee machine, and nourishing health peach gum and snow syrup at night. The breakfast in the Western restaurant on the Haitian line is pleasantly surprised everywhere.

üçÉEnvironment: It's really hidden in the city, low-key and luxurious.

üöó Transportation: It only takes about ten minutes from the airport to the hotel, which is very convenient.

üîîService: The butlers Kimberley, Krystal and Queeny are so dutiful. Even when the room is full every day, I still try my best to help me coordinate the check-out time. I also kept apologizing to us because the room was full. It was really a very meticulous service!

If you say the reason for going to Xiamen, it must be because you still have to live in Qishang!

msg:It was a very, very pleasant trip. From service to hardware, it was the best among similar hotels in China.

üîîService: Before traveling, the hotel butler will call and add contact information. I informed my housekeeper that Queeny was my birthday in advance. I did not expect to give me such a big surprise: hand-painted greeting cards, towel bunny cake, chocolate birthday cake, white wine, balloons, small lanterns... (I want to be special here. Thank you butler Queeny and the guest rooms Cai Xiaoting, Zhou Yuyan, Chen Xiaodan, thank you for your so careful preparation) Qishang‚Äôs service really makes people feel at home. The butler Queeny is enthusiastic and professional, responsive, and will be infected by her happiness and warmth~1 A little episode started to happen (the basic room type selected was not so satisfying). Fortunately, Queeny solved it perfectly for us. The recommended hydrophilic garden-view room is indeed very distinctive.

üçÉEnvironment: Needless to say, the environment is more beautiful than the camera. Pushing open the door of the balcony is the sound of birds and water, and it feels like a holiday.

üßπHygienic: The sanitary conditions are satisfactory, and there is no problem with sanitary dead ends. The room cleaning staff even took the initiative to put a lot of cotton pads when they saw that I was putting on makeup. These details make people feel too comfortable~

In addition, the hotel‚Äôs food and beverages are also in line with my taste.

I would like to say that there are many beautiful hotels, but there are really few services that make people so comfortable. I spent an unforgettable birthday here, and I will choose Qishang next time I come to Xiamen.

msg:Very comfortable three days and two nights! Thanks James for taking care of the whole process!
Because I told James that it was my birthday, Qishang was very considerate to upgrade my room when I checked in, and also arranged the room layout. When I arrived at the room, I found that it was on the first floor. There was a slight regret, because I actually wanted a higher level of vision. Come again next time. After all, the room upgrade is already very grateful!
On the birthday night, James delivered a birthday cake at the scheduled time. 3 rooms wanted extra late check-out and helped me apply successfully. I would say hello when I met in the hotel, and I would answer any questions. The service is really unavailable. Say.
The services of other staff in the hotel are also very good, and they pay attention to the expressions and needs of the guests. I met a tall housekeeper in the lobby and she took the initiative to solve the problem before I even said my confusion. It is not poke.
The spa is so comfortable, I can lie down on that hot stone lounger all afternoon.

After boasting, let's talk about the areas that can be improved:
1. It is not very good to send breakfast to the room. Especially on weekend mornings, many people can understand the lateness and rush, but the meals are greatly discounted compared to the restaurant, and there are missing meals, which is very different from the experience of hotel room delivery in the past. The food was cold and soft, and the tea spilled on the cup and saucer. Only half a cup of tea was left. The plastic wrap was stuck to the salad dressing/cream sauce of the food. The stickiness was not good when it was torn apart. Hope there will be improvement next time!
2. When I was in my sister‚Äôs room, a staff member came to deliver welcome fruit, so I asked if there was any in my room. He said that I need to check it, not every room has it. Another staff member who passed by at this time said that every room has it. Later, I saw it when I went back to my room. I don‚Äôt know if it was taken for me or every room has it. It‚Äôs a little embarrassing right now, and it‚Äôs not just for the fruit haha
3. The Minibar was cleaned the next day without replenishment, and when the weather was hot, I wanted to open a bottle of sparkling water for the first time. My elder sister said that their rooms have been repaired, so my room was negligent. Later, I called the front desk and sent it. But I still feel that this omission shouldn't be there.
All in all, the service of the hotel is still great. I believe the hotel will improve for individual flaws and will come again when the weather is not so hot!

Butler service is very good, you can consult with any questions about travel. I want to thank my housekeeper, Queeny, who is very enthusiastic and gentle.

Be sure to choose the Harbour King Room, you can see the sea directly, our floor is not high, and it is already very comfortable. You can also watch the sunset, the beautiful child. Comfortable. The breakfast is also very good, the mini bar üÜì. The toiletries used are diptyque, I like the scent of their home. The only regret this time is that I didn't drink a little wine at the lobby bar.

It's very convenient to go out to sea. When you go out and turn a corner, you will find a sea boat meeting, and you also caught a lot of small fish in sea fishing. It's near the airport. I want to live in the city center the last night, think about it or continue to live in Qishang, I want to choose here for comfort and quiet. One more sentence, their lychees are too delicious, although they were not picked from the lychee trees planted by the hotel, haha, I asked them specifically.

The second time I stayed at Qishang, a hotel that I am very satisfied and liked in all aspects, whether it is the hotel experience, service and catering are no less than other super five-star hotels, and the cost performance is very high. The price of staying in Bulgari for one day You can stay at Qishang for three days... If you have the opportunity, please come and try Xiamen Qishang Hotel

msg:When I came to Xiamen, I was amazed by the super beautiful design details. The facilities are full of one step. The facilities are also awesome. The large outdoor swimming pool. On rainy days, you can go to the large and small pools in the spa to relax and relax. Go to the lobby bar and have afternoon tea (order a lift Misu tastes absolutely perfect)
The breakfast is semi-buffet. The choice is actually a bit small, but the taste is great! !
Here I especially want to praise the service, the housekeeper‚Äôs sister, Qiaohui, is responsive, really don‚Äôt be too considerate, give me all kinds of things, recommend me places worth visiting in Xiamen, and take the initiative to help me late check-out...
Really satisfied with all aspects of this hotel, full recommendation

msg:I have stayed in many hotels, but Xiamen Seven is still the most impeccable resort hotel in details. The marble-inlaid wood carvings, the bluetooth speakers hidden in the legs of the table, and the specially designed lighting mode of the hotel are all creations and subversions of the hotel. The service is even more considerate. In addition to the afternoon snack and the sweet soup before going to bed, the housekeeper Qiaohui is also very considerate. He also shared the design concept of the hotel to me. Such a dedicated hotel is really worth a visit.

msg:Xiamen is a more meaningful place for us. I proposed marriage in Xiamen in 16 years. I came here this time. Too is almost 2 years old. When I lived in Conrad on the first day, the hotel housekeeper's sister Wendy contacted us in advance. We asked about the check-in requirements and gave us some suggestions for playing around. We learned that we were bringing the baby to play, and we also prepared a small gift for Duoge. The arrangement during the stay was very thoughtful, thank you again üòÄ! Speaking of the hotel, the address is in Wuyuan Bay, the environment is not much to say, the pictures are everywhere, and the photos are beautiful. The breakfast is semi-buffet, very exquisite, and many of them can be eaten by the little ones. The overall experience is still Yes, I will continue to choose Qishang next time!

msg:I chose Qishang Hotel for the anniversary. The beautiful mood began from the moment I stepped into the hotel! The hotel is a Chinese garden style, low-key luxury, everything you see is art and it is very Zen! After check-in, there will be a welcome drink to relieve the heat, and then there will be an exclusive butler reception! My housekeeper is a kind-hearted young lady Wendy, I would like to thank her very much. During the chat, I learned that I was a wedding anniversary and that we have a lot of hobbies in common. Unexpectedly, from this moment on, I will be surprised again and again! The room helped me make a warm decoration and gave me cakes and red wine! For dinner, a flower arrangement was made in the western restaurant, and the most unexpected surprise was that she made my favorite Korean fried rice cake! Especially authentic. Later I learned that it was the Korean chili sauce I got! ! ! Thank you very much! The cleaning sister also brought me some accessories when I checked out. Before leaving, the front desk also prepared the iron Luohan who loves to drink. All in all, the trip was very comfortable and very satisfied. I will definitely bring the children on vacation!

msg:Currently high-altitude hotels are very common, so I chose to stay at Qishang Hotel on my birthday. The fast but elegant check-in at the front desk, although the luggage is small, there are still butlers to help push the luggage throughout. There is even a small flower arrangement in the middle of the classic wooden elevator. After stepping out of the elevator, the corridor adopts the art wall with natural lighting, all of which give the body a relaxed and comfortable feeling. From the induction of the hidden door to the moment when the door is opened, the sea view of the yacht in Wuyuan Bay can be seen. In this place, there is no sound of opening and closing doors, footsteps and noises of the previous high-altitude hotels. In this unpredictable artificial rainfall in Xiamen, inadvertently, the warm sun will quietly recline into your room, and the combination of the room and the terrace At the place, the same wooden wall and one-piece sofa are used to display the wholeness of viewing in a decent way. The impression of the eye is full of peace and tranquility in this noisy world. The room is equipped with diptyque toiletries and Dyson, which is not as grounded as Conrad‚Äôs "Shanghai Beach". The turndown service at night is simply a blow, from the placement of milk and water on the bedside, to the refreshing mung bean soup snacks and cheesecake wishes, neatly stacked clothes on the side, and a fixed bathtub cover with a quilt, and then a roll. Good wiring harness, one can't help but sigh...Is this data cable a new thing just taken out of the box? In addition, it is not recommended to use the terrace at night. There will be large water ants who want to come here to live. After calling the front desk, a younger brother came to eliminate the ants and explained the ant's habits in detail. What the hotel needs is not only an excellent viewing advantage, but also a stack of luxurious facilities. It's the service from the heart and the undisturbed accommodation experience, compared with the comfortable bedding and luxurious hardware of Peng Rui and Ritz-Carlton, and compared with the island views of Grand Hyatt and Conrad. In Qishang, I seem to be in a private holiday villa, where only the world and you and me are left. Also, the housekeeper Zhang Yang‚Äôs contact was received the day before check-in, during which time you can contact him and actively serve the guests. Among the hotels in South China, Qishang is perhaps the best choice for people to stay out of.

msg:I have never seen a luxury hotel so bad! The front desk is just like **, they booked a room for 1800, but they haven‚Äôt confirmed it yet, and no one answered the phone! Finally, I was refunded because the room type was not available. Then I ordered more than 2,000 yuan, but I still haven‚Äôt confirmed it! Return it to me again! When he called me, he told me that only villa suites were left. I immediately placed an order for a villa suite worth more than 3,000 yuan! Not confirmed yet! He called me and told me that they were coordinating. In the end, all the guests were already in the car and on their way there, and they told me that there were no suites, only two-bedroom suites priced at 6,800! Originally I just wanted to arrange a room for the client within a budget of 2,000, but in the end I spent nearly 7,000! If you don‚Äôt have this room type, won‚Äôt it be removed from the shelves? ha? Come again! Doesn't your front desk know what room types are left? Don't you have to take the initiative to call the customer to explain the reason why there is no such room type? I booked 3 room types in a row and got refunded 3 times! I was already very angry, but I called the front desk and said it was reasonable (we just don't have this room type, there is nothing we can do.) Do I owe you something? The room customer said that it is very ordinary, very ordinary room, whether it is the service or the inside of the room, you are sorry for the price of 7,000. It's so ridiculous. It's said to be the best hotel in Xiamen, so it's your capital to do whatever you want, right? All are rave reviews.
