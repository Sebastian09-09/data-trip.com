msg:This hotel is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. The service seems to be friendly and enthusiastic, but in fact it is careless and unresponsive. It takes at least 30 minutes to deliver something to the room. There are robots that can deliver if there are not enough people, but you have to wait all the time. I asked for some tissues to be delivered to the room, but they agreed at first, but then I didn't say anything. After urging them, I was told that there was a limit on the number of tissues and they would not deliver them. The tissues are so thin that I have to use one at a time. Aren't you afraid that they will take up my stinky tissue? ? When I made the reservation, I was not informed that the TV would be repaired before 18:00 during my stay. The point is that the TV was also broken after 18:00, as evidenced by the pictures. Not to mention the Wi-Fi, which was completely disconnected in the toilet and only had one or two bars of signal in the room. I had to use my own data plan for the two-day stay... The breakfast was the worst I have ever had, and it was not at all five-star standard. Not to mention the soy milk, milk and ginseng water, the fruit juice should be made from powder, and there were very few dishes. Ham was considered a dish, and the fried rice next door also had this Ham... I couldn't choose what to eat at all. The meat buns were also pre-made, and the noodles had no meat toppings. It's summer now, so there are a lot of small flies, and the lids were not all closed, so the small flies got into the glutinous rice soup and the icing... But one thing I want to mention is that the service of the restaurant's chef and the fat guy is very good. They are responsive to every request, and when they saw that I was not convenient, they enthusiastically called the waiters to help. Thank them very much!

1. According to the evaluation, the crystal lamp is quite beautiful.
2. Parking is free, but it’s easy to drive to the wrong location next door.
3. The children's playground is small and I have no desire to play. It is next to the restaurant and there are many people making dinner reservations, so it is blocked and feels greasy.
4. The size of the room is okay, it has a bathtub, a sliding door, and the supplies are okay. It's not a big brand, but the smell is quite comfortable.
The TV is not big, but the view from the floor-to-ceiling windows is much better than the TV.
5. The sound of the air conditioner suddenly starting up in the middle of the night was like turning on a hair dryer. The water in the bathroom was running quickly, but the sound was also weird.
6. The variety of breakfast is okay, everything should be included. A group of old aunties are chatting excitedly about their family affairs. The chef at the noodle stall is very polite, but the chef at the teppanyaki area is too cold-faced. The food is pretty good and suitable for all ages.

Hygiene: There are no disposable bathtub covers and toilet mats provided. They are said to be sterilized and look okay to the naked eye.
But I don’t quite understand. If there is a plastic bag on the toilet but not in the trash can, does it mean that the guests should cover it themselves?


Environment: The surrounding shopping malls are not far away, and you can order takeout. The soundproofing of the room is OK. The upgraded room does not face the elevator, and it is staggered from the emergency exit.


Service: The service of the guy at the front desk was mediocre, but the lady who came out later was more enthusiastic and helped us book a room to look after the kids. The room we were given at the beginning was not cleaned before being given to us, but later she helped upgrade the room to a room with a better view. Thank you. .

Overall, the hardware is okay, but the service and details have to be closer to the five-star self-declared.
ps: There are two bottles of water in the room. If you have to go to the front desk to get more, I don’t know why.
Another depressing thing is that the child's slippers were left in the bathroom. Unfortunately, I don't know if I can find them.

I have stayed at a hotel in Greenland before, so I chose Nanqiao Platinum this time and specially booked a parent-child room. I liked the faint fragrance as soon as I entered the lobby. The hotel lobby is small, clean and bright, and the girl at the front desk is very enthusiastic. The decoration of the room is quite special. The front desk said it was made by Greenland’s own IP, so it’s good that the children like it. I mainly found the bed comfortable. There is a female staff member in the guest room who loves to smile and greets us very naturally. The hotel as a whole is not fashionable, but it can be seen that the care has been taken and the condition is still good. Looking at the negative reviews online, I was a little worried at first. In short, this trip to Fengxian, the children are happy, I am happy too, eat well, play well, sleep well, I will come again in the future.

msg:I come to Fengxian regularly and this is the best stay. I checked in a little early and caught up with the group to check out. A beautiful girl at the front desk handled the formalities. The hotel had a bit of an age feel, but the waiter's smile made people feel comfortable. Since the room type I ordered had not been cleaned, the front desk upgraded me. The room was spacious and bright, which showed the maintenance skills. There were a lot of people at breakfast, but things were replenished very quickly. I liked the variety. Overall, it’s great. I’ll continue to stay at Platinum next time I come to Fengxian.

msg:I come to Fengxian regularly. This time I stayed in Puli, which is convenient for meeting clients. The house is clean and tidy, and most importantly, the bed is comfortable, unlike other Fengxian hotels. The gym is not big, but it is enough for me. I guess not many people are used to working out now, so I can exercise by myself without being disturbed, which is very comfortable. The staff at the front desk, guest rooms, and restaurants are all enthusiastic and smiling, although there are a few young waiters who are a little unfamiliar, and they are probably new interns. I am a Ctrip VIP member. I am welcomed wherever I go. This hotel is very natural and genuine. It is highly recommended. I will continue to stay here next time I come to Fengxian.

msg:A very touching stay! Platinum is right opposite the business school. Come and see your children living here. The hotel has been open for many years, and some places are older, but overall it is well maintained and has a vintage feel. The rooms are clean and spacious, and the breakfast has a rich variety and tastes very good. The price is less than 500, so the price-performance ratio is good. I checked out and left my documents at the hotel in a hurry to catch my flight. The car was driving on the highway when the hotel called me and told me that I was in a hurry and it was too late to turn around and go back. The hotel offered to send me to the airport. About 20 minutes after I arrived at the airport, the hotel driver arrived at the airport and gave me my ID. I sincerely thank Nanqiao Platinum Hotel. I will stay here every time I visit my children in the future. I wish you better and better [strong]

There is nothing I can do about it. The room has thoughtful children's toiletries and the price is not expensive. Overall, I am satisfied. Breakfast is not particularly comfortable. There are few service staff, few dishes, and the taste is not good. Many are cold. Breakfast management still needs to be strengthened. Many tables are dirty and not cleaned.

msg:A hotel with both hardware and software, I don't understand why there are so few guests? Maybe it was closed for too long due to the epidemic? Or is it because it's almost Chinese New Year? Anyway, there were only three groups of guests at breakfast, and there was no way to handle the buffet. I thought the breakfast for one person was poor, but I didn’t expect it to be not sloppy at all. It is mainly Western style, with meat, eggs, milk, drinks and fruits. The room is large and well-equipped, but the TV is a bit small and the signal is not good, and the air conditioner is also noisy. Fortunately, it does not hinder sleep. I booked a business suite here at the price of a deluxe double bed room in Nanjiao Hotel, and it may not have anything to do with the children's paradise and the swimming pool. However, it is convenient to go out to eat here, and it is also close to Powerlong Plaza.
