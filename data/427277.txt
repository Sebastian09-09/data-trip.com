msg:Crowne plaza with a 3 star hotel rating. Please don't expect anything special as there were many issues. First this is outdated hotel with low amenities. The bathroom mirrors have rusting and the lamps are old. The TV is outdated and remote doesn't work properly. The fan doesn't work and there was rusty smell in the room. Staff can't speak English, but they tried their best. Breakfast was very old fashioned with less options. Salad was smelly and there is very less Western options. Even the Chinese dumplings and dough bread was outdated. I felt it was recycled from previous day. There is construction going on and you can hear the sound even in the early morning hours. Please update and renovate. Amenities are low standard. I have never thought of this hotel brand being degraded. only plus point is that it is in the downtown area with lots of connection options.

Service is inefficient, and sometimes nonchalant. The restaurants exist in various states; subpar, wholly unbothered and just plain closed. The location is pretty good though. It's not terrible, but you could probably do better at the price point.

msg:The hotel staff were friendly and helpful.  I arrived in the early evening and was quickly checked in.  They were clear with directions to my hotel room, where breakfast was served, and where the pool and gym were.  The day before I checked out, I needed to get a Covid test done and they directed me to the hospital doing these tests.  Even on the day of check out, my flight wasn’t until 7pm so they held onto my bags for me while I enjoy almost a whole full day on the beach.

The hotel’s location is great too.  It’s about a casual 15 minute stroll to Dadonghai and the restaurants in that area.  It’s also about a 10 minute walk from the popular night market.

Back inside the hotel, the rooms are comfortable and have great views.  The only issue I had was the lack of equipment in the gym.  While it did have everything one might need for a workout I felt it was missing one or two pieces of equipment that would make a workout feel complete.  The pool is right outside the gym and is great!  Comfortable location that gets sun for most of the morning but by 1 or 2 starts to become shaded by the building.  My only issue with the pool is that it was too cold.  The temperature they had written on the whiteboard nearby said it was 24c but, it felt much colder than that.

All together, I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone coming to visit Sanya.

msg:Crowne Plaza Sanya City Centre is a hotel from IHG group. It has everything what a traveller would need. The building and room facilities are in excellent conditions even the property has several years. My room was located in the 20th floor and even had some construction going on, no noise disturbing issues I had during my stay. The view over the city was phenomenal and very quite to seat at the balcony and get some food or a drink.

Every staff that I encountered proactively offer greeting which is not very common to see in hotels in China.

Furthermore, I would like to express my gratitude to Mrs. Eason Feng at the Front Desk who assisted me with my Check-In process very efficiently and without any inconvenient. As well, Mrs. Lavender at the fitness center who went beyond his work to assist me with some take-away issues and room service information (I can not read Chinese); In addition provided me excellent service at the gym and pool.
Last, but no least I would like thank Mr. Jodie Chen at the front desk who help me with my check out process in an excellent manner, following all IHG standards and  being flexible to my request. I thank him
 a lot.

The property is located right in city centre and very convenient to explore the city of Sanya. For the price it's an excellent choice in the city and totally recommend everyone to book this hotel.

msg:Unfortunately it does not live up to the name of Crown Plaza. Firstly it is dated, and rooms and hallways smell moldy and could use detailed upgrade. Although restaurants in hotel promote specialties, some are not open and it is not mentioned anywhere (e.g.Japanese restaurant). When we extended for one day (convenience) we were supposed to get a spa voucher, but at the front desk no one offered us any. We were not planing to get a massage anyways, but it simply speaks of customer service. So, if you just want to stay over in city centre, can find many better deals.

Personally, I really appreciate a good breakfast and if I have (buffet) dinner at the hotel, I don’t mind to pay a bit more for quality. At the crowne plaza city center, the breakfast and dinner is not expensive, but the quality is accordingly. 

Service is very friendly and efficient, with special thanks to front desk staff, good job!!

Overal: very good price/quality performance

msg:The old five-star hotel is worth recommending!
Although the hotel has a certain history, it is well maintained. Its comfortable, luxurious and elegant traditional decoration style is incomparable to new hotels, especially the professional management team. The hotel staff is professional, efficient and courteous. The service is in place, and the guests' needs are responded to quickly. All employees are smiling and take the initiative to understand the needs of travelers. The hotel facilities are complete, the swimming pool, room bathroom and fitness equipment are clean and tidy, the bedding is moderately soft and hard, the dining environment is comfortable, and the breakfast is varied and well-made. The two-night accommodation experience exceeded expectations. It is worth recommending. I will continue to stay next time. I hope the hotel can maintain its standards and retain its own style.
Personally, I feel that the lighting in the room and corridor is relatively dim, which may be designed to match the elegant and soft atmosphere. Other impeccable.

The sound insulation, room layout, hot water and drinking water are all very satisfactory. If you come during the peak season, the outdoor swimming pool on the third floor may be noisy. The only small problem I picked out may be that there is no hand sanitizer in the bathroom next to the breakfast restaurant

However, the overall stay is still very good, and there is a balcony and outdoor swimming pool!

When we arrived at the hotel, the air conditioner was already turned on for us. HK Ann's service attitude is really good. Our flight was at 10 pm, and they delayed our check-out to 3 pm for free, so we didn't have to drag our luggage out too early on our last day in Sanya. The hotel is also very close to the First Market, just over 10 minutes' walk away. Sinopharm Duty Free Shop is also nearby, which is very convenient. The river view at night is also beautiful. The hotel also has a swimming pool. Except for being a little humid, everything else is really fine.

Yuki contacted us before check-in and asked us if we needed anything. Knowing that we were a family, she directly upgraded us to a suite, which saved us a lot of trouble, and gave us executive trea**ent

The breakfast in this hotel is not very delicious, I can only say that I was full, and the breakfast can only be said to be OK, that's all

The room is a little old, some rooms in Building B are next to the construction site, and there are often constructions, but there is no noise since I live in a high-rise

In general, InterContinental hotels are not too bad
The TV is a little bit not very good. It will be disturbed by other rooms, and it will be turned up by itself when it is turned off to mute

I was very impressed with the facilities and layout of the room. Everything was so clean, comfortable and modern. I was very satisfied with the comfort of the bed, the facilities in the bathroom and the overall design of the room. In addition, the various amenities provided by the hotel, such as the swimming pool, further enhanced my good impression of the hotel.
However, what I will never forget is your service.

When checking in, the hotel facilities are fully introduced. The room is the largest I have ever seen in Sanya hotels of the same price and grade. It is really comfortable to drink tea and enjoy the scenery outside the window with a cool breeze on the balcony. I eat less breakfast and only tasted part of it. The variety is relatively complete to cater to tastes from all over the world. During the period, I especially thank Jason at the front desk for his warm hospitality. This hotel is my first choice when I come to Sanya.

The housekeepers Amy and Mei were really considerate. Even during the Qingming Festival, they patiently answered and solved my questions and needs. I was not at home during the day, and Mei and other staff members would come to clean my room every day with my authorization. If I was bitten by mosquitoes, they would also disinfect my room. I rarely write good reviews, but the sense of propriety of the staff made me feel that writing good reviews might be helpful to them, and it was very warm. I really recommend choosing Crowne Plaza for the same price! Such service processes and customer service management systems are very advanced. It feels more like home than the luxury brands I stayed in Haitang Bay.

msg:The brick-moving dog took advantage of the weekend to travel, and the red-eye flight arrived in the early morning of Saturday. The price of the hotel's calendar room is close to that of Holiday Inn Express, which is more cost-effective than other hotels under the IHG umbrella. Amy, the hotel service specialist, was very considerate and contacted before the trip. The room was upgraded to an executive room. It was very spacious and the bay view was unique compared to other sea views. The room facilities are relatively complete, and the decoration style is old cadre style, with a sense of age. Stayed for 3 nights and had a total of 2 breakfasts, 1 buffet dinner, and a trip to the executive lounge. Overall, I was satisfied, but there is huge room for improvement. It is convenient to travel and is very close to the No. 1 Sinopharm Duty Free Shop and Coconut Dream Corridor Yacht Terminal. Overall, the hotel has a great location and affordable price, and is very suitable for a short stay of 2 to 3 nights after a flight. However, since it is not close to the sea, if you are staying with children for a long time, it is recommended to pay more and choose a seaside resort hotel.

msg:The transportation in the city is convenient, and the view from the 23rd floor is good. Especially the service attitude of the aunt is very good. I must like it. When I bought the set meal online, I clearly saw that it came with a buffet dinner. When I arrived at the store, I was told that it was a health meal. , this is a bit too much, mainly because the healthy meal is like a lunch box, it tastes terrible! Be sure to look carefully when purchasing online!

Because my clothes were not dry when I came to other hotels, I called and asked for them. A clothes drying rack was delivered quickly by the waiter. The service attitude of the lady at the front desk was also very good. It is very convenient for eating and shopping. It is also very close for walking. There is a super popular food street with all kinds of snacks. I will buy it again next time I go to Sanya. Check in.

There is a spa, a high-end restaurant supporting the hotel, and the environment is very good. We stayed in the Crown Superior Twin Room on the 12th floor, which is the most classic room and has a beautiful view of the harbor, which is also great hahaha👍🏻. The cleaning lady knocks on the door every day to ask about cleaning, and the service is very good. It is highly recommended to place it in the middle of your trip to Sanya and stay there for about three days, which is a great experience.
Overall, I would give it 4.8 out of five points.

Two days before I checked in, the hotel called me and introduced me to the hotel and asked if I had any requirements. This is great. Special praise to fd amy. The service was very good and considerate during the stay. Later, because there were children, they would ask if they had any other requirements. This was a plus. After getting to the room, it was very clean and did not look old. It was very nice. The only drawback was that the hotel swimming pool was not constant temperature and swimming gear had to be rented. This was compared to Yanlord Crown. Maybe it’s not because of the family-friendly hotel, but overall I’m very satisfied with the convenient transportation and recommend it.

The housekeeper Amy was very responsible and communicated with me about my room preferences in advance, and helped me upgrade to room 2101 for free with a beautiful view. Lin Renyi, who was in charge of luggage, was very enthusiastic and helped me carry my luggage. I would like to express my thanks again to Amy and Leo Lin.
       My children's favorite thing is the outdoor swimming pool on the third floor. They can quickly gather a group of friends to play, and the lifeguards are also very responsible.
       The location of the hotel is indeed good. It is very convenient to go to the First Market and Hong Kong China Night Market. However, in the end I found that these night markets are very average. It is better to walk along Jiefang Road to experience the local life.
       If you have just landed in Sanya or will be departing from Sanya, you can consider Crown as a hotel to stay. It is cost-effective and allows you to experience the local life a**osphere. Recommended!

It is very convenient for eating and shopping. The room is of an older style, but the software is very good, the toiletries, slippers, etc. are of relatively high quality, and the hygiene is very good, and there is no mold or anything. Most rooms have good views, but you may see the construction site opposite. The hotel pool is very nice. The hotel service is quite attentive. FD Amy responded to almost every request during the stay. She was very considerate and received good reviews!
In general, if you come to Sanya and want to stay in a hotel in the city, and your budget is not particularly high, this Crowne Plaza is a good choice.

Stayed for 5 nights and had the hotel's seafood buffet dinner and the Guangdong Chaoxuan Chinese restaurant, both of which tasted good! Yangzhou fried rice is a kid’s favorite! The two-bedroom suites also have executive lounge benefits. If I have to make one comment, it is that the executive lounge is in Building A, and we live in Building B, which is a little far away. However, the location of the hotel is very good, in the city center, and the price is affordable for a five-star hotel. We went to Luhuitou near the hotel to watch the sunset, play in the sand on the Dadonghai Sea, catch the sea on the Xiaodonghai Sea, and the Coconut Dream Corridor is not far away. It's far away and can be reached within 20 yuan by taxi. There is also the First Market Night Market nearby. All in all, it was a very satisfying stay! 👍👍👍

msg:This is my second time staying here. The last time was before the epidemic. Although the room facilities are not the latest, the cleanliness is as reassuring as ever, which is the most praiseworthy aspect of the holiday. The service level is perfect. Amy at the front desk contacted us to confirm the arrival time after booking. After check-in, she also followed up at any time to understand the guest's needs. She cared about the guest's stay experience throughout the entire process. I would like to give special praise here. The only drawback is that it is a bit noisy during breakfast, probably because there are many tourist groups. The variety of Western food is limited and the workmanship is not authentic enough. For example, the baked potatoes taste like stewed potatoes, the bread is soft, not hard, and the grilled bacon that is standard in international chain hotels is not available. I hope that when I stay next time, I can experience what Crowne Plaza should have been like.

Later, they even put the panda babies in to sleep. Children's toothbrushes and soaps are adorable. In front of the hotel is the yacht center, and the night view is quite beautiful. The service was also very good. Amy and Xiaohan at the front desk were very enthusiastic and checked in quickly. They helped us get breakfast and dinner, and everything we asked for was delivered quickly.

We changed hotels the next day and after checking out, our police check-in information was still delayed, so we were unable to check into another hotel normally.

It is recommended that we just serve tour groups and not take casual classes.

msg:To sum it up in one sentence, the hardware facilities are relatively backward and the free travel photography is very confusing.
Because of travel photography, I chose the Crowne Plaza Hotel for my sailing trip.
Facilities: The hotel is located in the city, and the equipment is old. If you live on the B floor, you have to drag your luggage a long way. The path to the elevator is like a Beijing subway with adverti*****ts on the wall and glass-door shops. The elevator entrance is like an elevator in a bathing center. From time to time, someone appears wearing a bathrobe.
Hygiene: Bedding smells musty
Environment: There are construction units nearby and work 24 hours a day. The hotel has posted notices in the corners of each elevator floor for guests staying in the hotel, but not for people checking in.
Service: Hotel travel photography is simply deceiving! First of all, the travel photography was outsourced to another company. The company only shoots in Xiaodonghai. The service told me that it can be used in the hotel, but in fact it can only go to Xiaodonghai, and you need to pay for it yourself! We asked to shoot in the hotel, but the photographer was very arrogant and said that they would not accompany us. They did not take the client into consideration at all. The executive lounge is the sofa resting area in the corner of the lobby on the first floor, which is simply weak.

msg:The location of this hotel is in the center of Sanya, very close to Luhuitou. It can be used as the first or last stop of the trip. But the service is indeed a bit embarrassing. It can basically be regarded as no service. It is also the hotel with the weakest service in the entire Sanya trip.
In addition, the hotel's parent-child suite actually has relatively few parent-child facilities, only a small bed with toys and a simple shed.
Another reminder is that individual packages provided by the hotel need to be booked at least two hours in advance.
Well, the facilities throughout my stay are relatively old, and it is difficult to communicate with the hotel. It is basically implemented in accordance with the regulations, but it is a less humane space. I personally think it is okay as a business hotel, but not suitable as a family hotel for traveling.

Thinking that we had not been there for many years and wanted to visit tourist attractions, we decided to book a hotel in the city three days ago. After looking at the Crowne Plaza Hotel in the city for a long time, I made the reservation online. Due to personal reasons, I had to change my large suite to two rooms.

After hearing the news, Han asked if he could add himself on WeChat. After adding him, he informed the weather conditions in Sanya on WeChat before coming to Sanya, which was very considerate. After arriving in Sanya, after checking in, both rooms were upgraded and afternoon tea was provided. Xiaohan would ask about the check-in experience on WeChat every day. My parents and I thought her service was very good and very professional 👍 On the 18th, on the first night after checking into the room, a A little aside, there was a strange smell when we returned to the room where our parents lived after dinner. We called the front desk and the concierge guy who helped give us the room card and helped us change rooms was very enthusiastic. I didn’t even notice what his name was, so he just remembered to wear glasses 😂 He and the waiter Mei Sister Ri was very enthusiastic and thoughtful in helping me change rooms. In the next two days, whenever I met Sister Mei Ri at work, she would say hello. She always smiled and was very polite. My parents and I were very happy with our stay this time, and the hotel's location is excellent. My parents have been saying that the hotel in the city I chose this time is very good. I will definitely stay at this hotel next time I come. This is my true feeling. I haven’t experienced this feeling for a long time, so I wrote a lot 😃

It is conveniently located in the city center to go to the first market and other places, but the overall facilities are old and the service is terrible. The staff in the lobby bar at the front desk don't smile at all. The staff in the lobby bar said that food must be eaten at 3:00 pm, but the reception will close before 8:00 pm, which is a double standard! The air conditioning in the breakfast area is seriously insufficient, and it is extremely hot. The area with sufficient air conditioning says that only members can enter, and the attitude is still very strong. There is a fee for renting the swimming rings in the swimming pool, which is very stingy. It is a hotel that is lacking in other aspects except transportation convenience. . ,

Standing on the balcony has a wide view, a nice view, and a cool breeze. It is recommended to live in a high-rise room because the view is excellent ha. Guests who stay can enjoy the use of the swimming pool and gym. The hotel has Chinese, Western and Japanese restaurants. The location of this hotel is also quite good, not far from the first market night market, about ten minutes walk; there is a bus stop within three minutes of the hotel, so it is very convenient to take the bus. The wireless network in the room is fast, and the auntie cleans the room every day; the doorman of the hotel has a good service attitude, and takes the initiative to carry the luggage for the guests and open the door; the concierge staff actively discourages smoking tourists from smoking in the designated smoking place in the lobby; the lobby works The staff was also very patient to solve the problem for us. I bought seafood the night before we left the hotel and needed to freeze it. After communication, we agreed to help freeze the seafood products and solved the needs of the guests in a timely manner. During the stay, the hotel also arranged a bus to and from Sanya International Duty-Free Shop in Haitang Bay. You need to make an appoin**ent one day in advance, and you can also collect electronic coupons from the duty-free shop. Overall, this five-day and four-night stay experience is very good. I will still choose this hotel when I come to Sanya in the future. I sincerely recommend friends who come to Sanya to stay in this hotel💗💗💗.

Gold, the front desk also gave me a room upgrade and free breakfast when I checked in, which is great. Let’s talk about the unsatisfactory aspects.
1. The hotel didn’t offer any benefits when checking in. After asking, they were told that a piece of fruit would be sent to the room. I had to wait for at least an hour and was urged to deliver it. The presentation was also very average, with fruits like apples and bananas.
2. Then I went to the restaurant to redeem the drink coupons for three days and they were still out of stock. later hit
The guest service phone number provided iced freshly squeezed juice before check-out, but the quality was very poor. It was filled with water and was at room temperature.
3. The breakfast service can only be said to be poor. For three days in a row, no matter when I went, there were always a lot of empty dishes. I asked the service staff to add more, but they just replied that I would wait. After ten or twenty minutes, there was still nothing. Add 1 liter to each drink
It will bottom out after a while, no reminders will be given, no additions will be made, and you will have to wait for a long time even after multiple reminders. The supply of the three varieties is not guaranteed. For example, if the juice is gone, just pour cola into it. The restaurant was very hot, with almost no air-conditioning. There was a members' area at the back of the entrance. I didn't find out until after the meal on the last day that no one prompted me when registering for the meal.
4. The guest room is relatively old, but overall it is relatively clean.

msg:Let me talk about the advantages first
1: The location is good, next to Luhuitou, next to the cruise ship center, to Yalong Bay, Wuzhizhou Island, Coconut Dream Corridor, all very close, and the night view is also good
2: The service attitude of the hotel is also good, the service buddies are very enthusiastic, the facilities are complete, swimming pool, bar, cafe, restaurant, massage, gym are complete
3: The room is very spacious, not aggrieved. Because Sanya is very trendy, there is a sign, you can make an appoin**ent to dry bedding at the hotel!
4: The house is relatively tidy, it will be cleaned regularly, and the sound insulation is not bad, so it will not be particularly noisy when sleeping at night.
Besides the disadvantages
1: The hotel is old and the decoration is relatively old. The fly in the oin**ent is that there is no matching refrigerator. If you want a cold drink, you can only buy a bottle downstairs for 10 yuan!
2: The shower in the bathroom will not produce hot water the next day, so you can only take a bath in the shower! need to wait for water
3: There are indeed cases of bad smell in the bathroom, and the bad smell is particularly unpleasant, so you need to bring some desiccant there!
4: A few lights are not on, and the room will be dark at night!
5: The jack on the side of the bed can't be used, it's broken! maybe only my room is broken
Overall positive, due to great, build, room for improvement

msg:First of all, there is no welcome at the door
Secondly, check in at 3 pm, there is no room yet and you have to wait for an hour
It is obvious that the room can be upgraded, but I still need to remind the front desk
Giving suggestions and complaints is also a non-action, indifferent attitude
The overall service experience for me is the worst I have ever stayed in a five-star hotel
Let's talk about the environment and equipment
Check-in requires a large circle to enter the room, and there is no air conditioner in the corridor
I was already sweating profusely when I walked to the door of the room (maybe the equipment is old and not designed)
In addition, there are many bugs in the room, the sheets are damp and warm, and the windows are obviously not open (because when I lived in the past, I noticed that it would be very humid if the air conditioner was turned on and the windows were opened)
The experience is really bad. I woke up early in the morning with all my clothes on. I stayed in Mangrove before. The Holiday Inn is also a five-star hotel, including Greenland Platinum. The service environment and facilities are much better than this hotel.
Although it has been a hotel for 15 years, this five-star hotel obviously cannot show what it should look like. It is also the Crowne Plaza Hotel in our local area. Whether it is service, environment or sanitation, it is much better than this one.
I also came here after looking at this brand, but I was very disappointed. I will not choose this brand again in the future.

msg:Facilities: As a veteran Crown Hotel under IHG, it has all the facilities you should have. It was only renovated in 16 years, some facilities are a bit old, but they are very clean.
Hygiene: The hotel has done a good job in terms of hygiene, and no problems can be found during the stay.
Environment: The swimming pool is very good. There is no saying in Xiaohongshu that the gym pool closes at 19:00, and it closes at 23:00.
Service: First-class service. On the 18th floor of Building B, I asked three times when I just cleaned the room, which is very good. There is a lot of passenger traffic when getting on and off the bus, and you can still trot over to pick up your luggage, whether you are checking in or leaving.
Overall, the price/performance ratio is very high, the only disadvantage is not being able to see the sea, and the facilities are very clean. It is very close to the first market and Chinese medicine duty-free shop. The swimming pool is very big and nice, especially the lifeguards are very enthusiastic, telling us the sunset time of Coconut Dream Corridor, reminding us in time to take a taxi to watch the sunset after swimming.
Finally, there is a sunset picture of the Coconut Dream Corridor (๑＞＜๑）

①About hotel facilities
The facilities of the hotel seem to have had some years, but the maintenance is not bad. The bathtub in the room is large enough that the hotel can provide a bathtub cover. It has been a long time since I purchased the TV, and it is a pity that Internet TV cannot be used. The hair dryer in the room worked well too.
②About hotel sanitation
The sanitation of the hotel is satisfactory, from entering the lobby to stepping into the elevator room, and entering the public areas of the guest rooms are neat and clean. The shower room, toilet, and bedding in the room are very good.
③About the hotel environment
The location of the hotel is close to the city center and the transportation is convenient. Although there is a meeting reception in the lobby, the overall is relatively orderly. The hotel is filled with the fragrance of the crown, which makes me feel familiar, comfortable and relaxing. Standing on the balcony, you can see Luhuitou Park.
④About hotel service
When I arrived at the hotel lobby, there was a porter who provided services. I need to praise the following service staff: At the entrance of the lobby is the handsome young man Wu Yingyang whose warm and hospitable service infected me; when I entered the front desk, it was the beautiful Ms. Alice who handled the procedures for me. Thoughtful; the service staff will greet me on the way to the guest room, which is worthy of praise; the guest service center of the hotel is warm and patient to help me, Carla and Jesse let me remember their names at once; the guest room service staff My elder brother knew that I needed to make tea, so he gave me a few more bottles of mineral water. Although I didn’t see your name, I still need to mention it; the elder brother of the recreation depar**ent took the initiative to help me open the parasol, which moved me. I appreciate the above in Crowne Plaza Thanks again to the staff who gave me an unforgettable experience during my stay at the hotel.
⑤Supplementary recreational part
There are not many people in the hotel's gym, and it is very comfortable to run in the gym. The most satisfying thing about the recreational part is the hotel swimming pool. It was very relaxing to swim twice during the stay at the hotel. The service staff is also very thoughtful. I look forward to the next stay.

msg:Very satisfied hotel.
Specifically mentioned in the following aspects:
1. Convenient, convenient transportation, the bus station is just outside the door. It is also very close to the surrounding shopping malls.
2. Humanized hotel management. Because I arrived early, the hotel was not cleaned. You can store your luggage directly in the lobby. Received a call from the clerk after cleaning. When you arrive, your luggage will be brought up by the staff.
When I arrived in Sanya, it rained for several days in a row. I opened the closet and found that there was an umbrella in the hotel closet, no need to rent it.
3. The hotel is clean and hygienic, with good sound insulation, and almost no other sounds are heard.
4. The service is very attentive. I washed the clothes the night before and hung them on the chairs on the balcony. When I came back, I found that the cleaning lady added a clothes hanger and transferred all the clothes to the clothes hanger. How should I put it, I was very moved. Everyone can feel the attentive service.
Overall, next time I come to Sanya, I will directly choose to live here. The three days I lived in Haitang Bay were really depressing. To choose a hotel is to choose a convenient, thoughtful, and clean one.

msg:I came to Sanya with my wife for honeymoon and stayed in the hotel for three days. Before check-in, Tina called to ask about our needs and arranged the room we liked. During our stay, we had a very good experience. Many thanks to Tina for her butler service.
The location of the hotel is in the city center, and it is very convenient to go to various scenic spots. Although it is not by the sea, it is near the bay with a wide view. It is only 2 kilometers to the beach, and it costs 10 yuan to take a taxi.
The hotel facilities feel very new, everything should be there. My wife likes the sky swimming pool on the third floor.
For hotel catering, the 158 double coconut chicken set meal is very good, with high cost performance and large quantity. However, there is no air-conditioning when eating at noon. It is recommended to install some fans; the breakfast is in line with the price, but the signboard of the egg stall is not obvious, and you will not find it if you don’t look carefully. The level of the omelet master needs to be improved.
The concierge room catering staff at the front desk, and even the security guard are very enthusiastic.
Overall is a very cost-effective hotel

Children like it very much. The buffet dinner is also okay, the facilities are well-equipped, and it is suitable for family outings. Tableware has a high standard, and the hotel manager can solve problems in a timely manner. The environmental sanitation of the accommodation is much better than that of the express hotels with the same price. The service attitude is standard and it is worth recommending. The yacht dock is opposite the downstairs, and you can go out to sea. Special thanks to Miss Wang in the customer service center for her good service and helping me delay the refund for free Room time, great [strong]

It was all set up when we checked in, and we checked in at 11 o'clock in the morning on the weekend of the same day, and there was no waiting for a room. A little bit of problem that occurred during the period was also responded positively by the front desk and switchboard colleagues I have nothing to say about the service of the concierge brother.

After Manager Cheng learned the news, he also synchronized my check-in requirements to this hotel. He was very careful ,really thankful!

It cost 50 yuan for an hour for children to play with boats in the swimming pool, but it rained for 10 minutes before they could play. The lifeguard asked everyone to come up to the swimming pool and stopped swimming. After they came up, the lifeguard asked me for 50 yuan. I said that the children didn’t even play for 10 minutes. How could I give it to you? The lifeguard said he couldn't give it to me and asked me for 30 yuan. It was raining and I took my child to give it to him. I was already disappointed with your hotel. After checking out, he called me and asked me where I put the children's slippers. I didn't respond to the first call because I was given disposable children's slippers when I checked in! I said the slippers were in the room! The second time I called the hotel, I asked for disposable children's slippers, where were they? Where could it be? On the ground! The lobby manager called for the third time and said that the wrong room number was reported. He made a mistake and apologized. He was disappointed. This was not the first time he had stayed at the Crowne Plaza hotel from Ramada. This was the first time that this happened, so he was disappointed!

I thought I would take the children to play in the children's playground for an hour, and then another hour When I arrived, I went to inquire again and was told that I would have to wait for half an hour. After half an hour, I went to inquire again and said that it would take another 20 minutes. By this time, it was already 3:30. I asked the front desk why they had to wait and wait without an exact time. At this time, the front desk suddenly said that there was a room, and another room was arranged for us. Since there is a room, why didn't they just give it to us? We insisted on waiting. It took a long time to arrange it, but after I checked in, I found out that the arrangement was an executive room, not the parent-child room we booked, and there were no children's products. I guess it was because we had urged many times at that time and randomly arranged an executive to deal with us. About our reservation The various rights and interests in the room are like squeezing toothpaste. I asked and answered. The room is quite big, but the layout of the facilities is a bit old. The bathroom door cannot be closed. The TV is that old-fashioned. The air conditioner in the room can't turn on the heat. It's terribly hot. One can say that the scenery is not bad. Opposite is a yacht club. The children's playground is average. There are not many things. The snack cakes served by the executive are not bad, very delicious. The colorful set meal is next to the hamburger The potato chips are all wet, how long has it been left. There are too few breakfast varieties, so I won’t eat it the next day

Service: There is basically no service at all 😂 When you enter the door, you will see two concierges chatting and laughing there, and they will not greet guests. Is it possible to check in? I didn’t feel any enthusiasm during the entire check-in process, and I didn’t take the initiative to introduce it during breakfast time. I asked myself 😓
Hygiene: There may be a lot of guests in the hotel. The room given to us is estimated to have just been driven out without a ward round. The floor is still wet. There are tea leaves on the ground directly under the closet, and there are marks on the quilt cover and pillowcase (call later for someone to change ), at night, I found that the water stains on the mouthwash cup are also obvious 👀
Facilities: The facilities are not bad. Although it has been open for a long time depending on the time, the maintenance is not bad. The gym and swimming pool are not bad
Environment: The floor of the room I live in is on the 6th floor, which is relatively low. You can see the river, and the scenery is average, but the location of the hotel is really good. It is near Dadonghai, and it is also very close to the night market of the first market. It is more convenient to go anywhere👍

msg:Very bad check-in experience: 1. There is no one to help with luggage at check-in. 2. Please let Ctrip inform the hotel of my request for the room in advance, but the sanitation is still worrying, especially the toilet is not cleaned. 3. The administrative trea**ent was changed to the lobby. I was treated like an enemy. As a result, the drink served by the service staff in the lobby bar was a defective can, and it was placed on my table stiffly. There were unknown water stains on the dinner plate, but the waiter said it was fine and let me just wipe it with a paper towel. 4. The breakfast starts at 6:30, but there is no service staff. The egg noodle stall and the flour mixing table are all relying on one person. Because the waiter was eating breakfast at that time! ! ! It's too weird, it's not enough for everyone to open a meal, it's the "old soldier" who wants to eat breakfast by himself! Unheard of! 5. The above-mentioned complaints were ignored by the hotel, and the hotel asked for discounts or reductions in room rates. The hotel dishonestly asked me to use a meal coupon of several hundred yuan in the hotel, or let me use a vehicle once, or delayed check-out until six At this point, I clearly informed the hotel that my itinerary was fully booked, I didn’t have a meal plan at the hotel, and I also rented a car with Ctrip. I didn’t need to use the hotel’s car, let alone late check-out, because my return flight at noon turned out to be The hotel ignored my complaints any more. 6. Here comes the strange thing. After I checked out and I returned to Nanjing, the hotel called me. They had a surprisingly good attitude. They said that they had made mistakes in their work, which resulted in the omission of the room fee. At this time, their attitude was surprisingly good. I also admitted that I was wrong. After the hotel executives called me, they agreed with my reasonable demands and said that they would bear the other half of the room fee. In the end, it was over, the reservation depar**ent missed the charge for the room, and the employee who made the mistake somehow found my number and sent me a message asking me to help her, otherwise she would be deducted from her salary. It's very strange how the hotel handles it. What I don't understand is that the real responsible person has not been dealt with? The employees of the reservation depar**ent are not within the scope of my complaint, but they have to bear the complaint losses caused by the negligence of employees in other depar**ents. Or a routine moral kidnapping? In short, this CP is the worst high-star hotel I have ever stayed in. From top to bottom, there is a lack of management and a lack of responsibility for work. Every front-line service person is like my creditor. Cold face! If there is no future, friends and relatives must never come to this hotel!

The attitude intensified the conflict, and was dragged away from the scene by the hotel security manager. The hotel management has always refused to give the customer a sincere solution. Even when the Ctrip platform assisted in the communication process, it repeatedly refused to provide public area surveillance video to restore the truth!
  The quality of food in the breakfast area was extremely poor in the Crowne Plaza Hotel where I stayed. The garbage on the restaurant floor was not cleaned up in time. There were big cockroaches in the room. After sleeping on the bedding, my family members were bitten by unknown insects in many places.

Check-in and check-out are quick. The buffet breakfast is rich in dishes, and the freshly prepared Hainan noodles are delicious. Thanks to the housekeeper (although I don't know her name) who made our room very clean every day. The layout and facilities of the room are very useful, the bed is comfortable, and there is a big balcony. It can be called a real five-star.

msg:Although the hotel industry in Sanya has made a lot of money in the past few years due to the epidemic, it does feel that the rapid development of Sanya's urban construction and hotel accommodation industry is quite obvious compared to when Sanya came to Sanya seven years ago.
This time I got off the plane and temporarily booked the Crowne Plaza Hotel in the center of Sanya. The overall design of the hotel combines new Chinese and Southeast Asian styles. With the blessing of Ctrip Golden Diamond membership rights, I can enjoy room upgrades, late check-out and executive lounge trea**ent. , it is a comprehensive experience in the hotel.
The hotel facilities are relatively complete. The area of the lobby, the number of restaurants, the fitness center, and the reception capacity of conferences and banquets all conform to the positioning of the Crowne Plaza brand. The overall design of the hotel is simple and not exaggerated (there are two other CPs in Sanya for reference). It is still not outdated today, and the TV and audio in the bathroom have been "cost controlled" in many new hotels. However, in this Crowne Plaza, in the humid climate of Sanya, the overall maintenance is not bad, but the details of the rooms have been Damaged, taking the B2701 room I stayed in this time as an example, the fan, toilet sliding door, shower glass door, etc. can no longer function. I hope the hotel will strengthen daily maintenance.
As far as the hotel service I experienced this time, it's a little hard to say. Let me first say the good place. If the room status allows, the front desk directly upgraded the basic room type I booked to the Crown Bay View King bed on the 27th floor of the highest floor of Building B. Room (the highest in Building A is on the 16th floor), and it is my favorite corner room with a wide field of vision. Downstairs is the yacht center harbor, and you can overlook the sea. It is worthy of recognition that the hotels under the InterContinental Group can still provide small bottles of toiletries. Due to the epidemic, the executive lounge is not open, so the executive trea**ent afternoon tea and HH are placed in the lobby bar No. 3 bar, and the afternoon tea production is worthy of praise. Let's talk about the areas that need to be improved in service: the drinks of the executive trea**ent are a bit simple, the regular Yiquan sparkling water and beer are not available, the happy hour in the evening is also very simple, and the executive trea**ent does not include breakfast. In addition, the front desk did not take the initiative to inform the hotel to provide nucleic acid testing services the next morning at check-in (the front desks of other hotels who stayed in the hotel would take the initiative to inform), but I missed the nucleic acid test in the hotel that day, and went outside for a long time and wasted time. I hope Hotel to be improved.
In general, as a standard luxury brand under InterContinental, the overall is still good, I hope the hotel will be better and better.

The waiter was clean and timely. Swimming pool closes at 11pm etc. Order takeaway, the doorman keeps it in the cabinet. It takes about ten minutes to walk to the first market, and it is very good to eat seafood. Most importantly, the price is affordable. The downside is that the door in front of the mirror cannot be closed. It takes 10 minutes to walk to the nearest nucleic acid point, and the queue is huge

🧹Hygiene: It is the most satisfying point of this trip. The aunt on the 19th floor of Building B is very nice, and the cleaning is very clean. The service attitude is really nothing to say, very kind

🔔Service: In general, the concierge brother will not take the initiative to open the door. Two of us girls went to the hotel with a big bag. We opened the door and closed the car door by ourselves. Several concierge brothers just watched us and need to be strengthened.

Overall, the hygiene is very satisfactory. I don't understand the facilities in the room very well. The bathroom door is completely transparent. It originally had a partition. Before, it was fixed because some guests caught it. It would still be a bit awkward to stay with friends. The minibar in the room is empty, and the swimming pool is charged. This is a hotel with a very general experience under IHG.

Due to the epidemic prevention and control, the hotel does not allow takeaways to be delivered. If you are too lazy to go downstairs to eat, you can order food directly from the hotel.

1. Entering the door and sitting down, the stains on the sofa are super obvious
2. The socket is stained, obviously
3. Go to the balcony, the glass on the balcony, and the glass in the room, it's unbelievably dirty
4. The socket is out of power. It's terrible. Floor lamps, desk lamps, and all kinds of lamps have power. There is no socket. I picked up the phone and complained. The microphone was sticky. The ladder is really dirty
5. The basin is like this...
6. There is also this obvious router, it's 2022... It's really slow to use
7. There is no serious problem with the service
Is the aging of the facility is serious, there are problems with housekeeping

Will not stay again, never will
In the end, it might just be cheaper...

When the cleaning was called the next day, the staff helped us move into the balcony of the room, and we realized that it was a drying rack (⸝⸝•‧̫•⸝⸝). The hotel staff is so cute and will always give you some silently Attentive service. The hotel also has an open-air swimming pool with clean water and a lifeguard next to it.

msg:There are a lot of mosquitoes in the hotel, the experience is very poor, and the room is not cleaned at all. When I booked the hotel, I said that I would be free to surf for an hour. When I arrived, I said that I couldn’t make a reservation for one of them. If two people add a share of money, they can go. The price for one person on his side is the same as the two people who booked outside. , Then we said that we can wait until someone else goes together, and then called again at night, saying that we can upgrade and go alone by adding money. Isn't that still a routine? Then there was an epidemic in Sanya. We said that we had to leave after the next three days. The hotel said that you had to provide an air ticket record to prove that you were not in Sanya before you could return. How unconfident are you? Knowing that your hotel is not good enough, you are afraid that we will change hotels. Do not recommend this hotel!

msg:It's too bad. I used to think that the check-in equipment and facilities are old. It's understandable. After all, there is a balcony to breathe. Now I find that the service of this hotel is extremely poor.
1. My hotel guest forgot the suit in the closet and couldn’t find it a week after leaving the store. During the period, there was no notification from the hotel customer service to remind me that it was lost. I have been looking for it. A week later, I called at night to ask if it was left at the hotel. The service staff told me that I would not know the result until the next day. After repeated urging, I was unwilling to help with the inquiry. Or do you take it yourself? I asked back, why didn't I inform you of the missing clothes in time? The service staff informed: The suits left in the closet by the guests may not be needed, so no notice? ? ? Then I would like to ask if I don't contact you, will you keep the things? Moreover, the customer service personnel kept repeating the sentence Self-pickup or postage to pay, and did not respond or respond to the questions asked. This experience is something I have never experienced in many hotels I have stayed in. 2. When I asked the manager to respond to the problem, the customer service staff hung up the phone many times. The reply is that our hotel must have contacted you. Did you leave the wrong phone number? Excuse me, I have stayed in your hotel so many times and left the wrong phone number, don't you feel prevaricated for this reason? Repeatedly saying innocuous words about training, I didn't pay attention to what happened to my management at all. Too bad. So disappointed.

No one said to call the next one. I asked if I could handle it. He said it was so indifferent. The arranged room was fine. It’s really in place. It’s next to the linen room. I didn’t see the room. It’s so hidden. I thought it was a linen room for me. It’s even more fun to check out. My husband picked up my child and me on an electric car.

The result was a pleasant experience. The hotel is located in a superior location. Very convenient, shopping malls and supermarkets are all available on the pedestrian street. Just a few minutes after I checked in to the room, the room manager rang the doorbell and asked if the room was cleaned and asked if I was satisfied with what I need to order. Then I asked for a clothes rack. After the manager Wang Weiyi delivered it to the room, Sister Wang Meiri came to the room and asked if there was anything. I need to see my daughter give a small gift to the children. The daughter said that she was very touched. This is a special welcome for the people of Hainan. The waiter Chen Lianjiao cleaned the room and the restaurant was spotless. The service was also very good. Yaxiu turned out to be extremely poor compared to Crowne Plaza, and finally moved to Crowne Plaza for another two nights. The hotel’s airport drop-off service was very considerate.
All in all, I came to Hainan, Haikou and Sanya, and stayed for 9 nights. Crowne Plaza is the most satisfactory hotel. From the location, the sanitation, and the service are impeccable. My daughter said that if I have a chance to come to Sanya in the future, I would choose Crowne Plaza Central.

The aunt cleans very carefully. The younger brothers and sisters at the front desk give free room upgrades and also give late check-out. At this time, Sanya is off-season, and the price is pretty good

msg:The most speechless hotel, I had to leave Sanya early due to work reasons, and I asked for a one-night refund before checking in, but I didn’t agree with life and death, why is your family short of earning me one night’s money? The sound insulation effect is also very poor, not worth the price. If you have the money, it is better to live elsewhere. To get a takeaway, you have to go to the security booth at the door. The facilities are not perfect enough to make it look like a five-star hotel. The infinity pool lives up to its name!

msg:The old environment of the hotel is average, and the location is not bad. The executive lounge is useless, the service can't keep up, the drinks are stingy and unwilling to give to the guests, and the meals are even more pitiful! If it is such an executive lounge trea**ent, it is simply one of the worst experiences I have ever experienced. The staff service is even more unprofessional and has a bad attitude. I asked the switchboard to help me transfer to the front desk, and asked me impatiently what I wanted to do? ! As a guest, such a poor service attitude simply refreshes the three views. I won’t post the photos, anyway, I don’t recommend staying here.

msg:如果對度假體驗要求特別高的話，我個人覺得這家酒店真的不是特別合適。

房間面積真的很大，有一個很棒的陽台，這個也是是我覺得這家酒店最出彩的了。

整體入住下來，中規中矩，我認為匹配不了皇冠假日的五星服務。也有可能是市中心的原因，人們出行覓食方便，所以我覺得酒店的早餐有點雞肋，出品不多，138元一位的早餐偏高，我覺得50元都可以了。

第二是房間的熱水，水温我感覺最高衹保持在36℃左右，想要泡一個40℃的熱水澡是很難的。問了服務員，工程部，也衹是來看看，然後就沒有然後了，退房時也沒有人和我解釋情況，所以説滿足不了五星服務體驗感。

退房後，有客服打電話過來問入住體驗，可能是要好評的，但我覺得，入住的時候沒有處理好，事後你做記錄處理，那有什麼用呢？對我也沒有達到半點的幫助和補救。

總結，如果是單純是過夜一晚，不是度假泡酒店的，仍然是可以選擇這裏的，畢竟叫外賣，覓食，靠近市中心，沖這幾點確實是非常方便的。

msg:最近幾年每次到三亞玩都會入住三亞中心皇冠假日酒店，今年是第四年了，性價比還是比較高的，衹是和上次相比有一些變化：
1.藍岸咖啡廳的小童活動區玩具有更新，以前臟臟的玩具終於換成了衞生好打理的滑梯鞦韆組合
2.相比之下小童俱樂部就有些遜色了，沙子已經用了很久了，海洋球池底下也有不少臟東西，繪本室的玩具桌沒有了，故事書也少了一些，而且也沒有什麼小童活動
3.住客很多，還有不少旅遊團，早餐的時候人特別多，不知道是不是人多的原因，感覺前台比以冷漠了，無論是入住還是退房都是板著臉，入住的時候衹給了我們一張房卡，進門插在取電處，再下樓拿外賣就得再去一趟前台重新要兩張卡，感覺前台工作不到位
4.洗髮水沐浴露這些都換成固定在牆上的大瓶包裝了，品質不變，更加環保了，還增加了洗手液
5.自助晚餐價格更便宜了，烤肉沒有以前現烤的好吃，而且三文魚刺身也沒有了
6.大堂多了一個免税店，休息區變少了
如果有機會再去三亞玩，希望還能再住這裏，希望體驗到的還是一兩年前的那樣熱情貼心的服務和乾淨衞生的環境，畢竟這是以前的性價比之王，希望能越來越好

1.前台工作人員不夠熱情，感覺對客人預訂套餐也不太熟悉。我提前攜程訂的基礎房型，套餐説的可以免費升級，辦理入住的時候我提起這個事，工作人員才給我升級換的；
2. 房間沒有紙巾盒，衹有洗手枱提供有，為什麼客廳會沒設定呢？
3.入住的時候看到有提供水果，但我的房間是沒看到有的；

msg:這次入住三亞中心皇冠假日酒店之前，服務專員FD Amy提前電話聯繫我們，瞭解我們的需求，安排房間面向遊輪碼頭，尤其遊輪碼頭及海灣夜景特別迷人，在入住期間也主動了解客人需要。23層客房服務員，服務態度好，服務周到。在我們退房去機場，前廳吳小哥主動來幫助我們裝行李等。總之，入住中心皇冠假日酒店，酒店設施、衞生、環境都是很理想的，性價比高。這次入住，由於住的時間較長（5天4晚），也有以下方面可進一步提升。一是連續住了四晚，早餐品種基本沒有變化，二是大廳前台接待員不夠熱情，態度有點生硬，三是客人到達時，迎賓小哥缺乏主動服務意識，例如客人行李多也不主動幫助。這些方面相比我們住過的其他5星酒店還是有些差距。但總體入住體驗是好的。

msg:來三亞那麼多次第一個我還沒到就主動致電我詢問安排時間和需求的酒店。
Amy非常的熱情，主動提及對於房間是否有什麼要求，入住當天提前告知我房間已經按照我前一天預估的入住時間打掃好可以隨時入住，中間有任何問題也都可以及時幫忙，非常貼心。
服務員也都很熱情，每天房間打掃的很乾凈，房間面積很大，陽台也特別寬敞。
酒店出行很方便，到第一市場吃飯步行即可。對面的免税店比海棠灣的還便宜，該有的大牌也都有。
還是非常值得選擇的。

1.總機服務不熱情！我 6 月 14 日訂的，15 號晚上快 23 點入住，差不多 22:00 打電話問問是否還有房間，結果讓我自己從網上看😂
2.房間衞生差，入住的房間枕套及被套臟，櫃子裏的杯子有新水印，重點是毛巾櫃有很厚一層灰，像是很久沒清潔過。經過反應後給換了房間。
3.房間設施老舊，尤其是座機聲音非常非常小，幾乎聽不見聲音，還有的線被拔出來了沒插回去的。
最後表揚一下 15 號晚上上班的客房大姐，服務熱情態度好！總機的工作人員可以學習一下

msg:選擇住在這裏主要是離我家很近，每年來三亞頭幾天都會住在這裏（家裡長時間不住需要打掃）
酒店房間面積足夠，設施稍顯老舊，價格不算高，不要早餐也就四百多塊，還是很實惠的，當然酒店的早餐也很不錯。
酒店不屬於度假酒店，如果來帶孩子來度假我不推薦住這裏，如果是來出差辦事這裏不錯，交通方便，周圍酒吧餐廳夜總會林立，還是挺合適的。
對了，早上比較吵，河邊有人跳舞，喇叭開的挺大，睡懶覺的慎重選擇。

msg:硬件：酒店介紹寫着2015年裝修，整體風格是比較老酒店那種，整體看的出的有點陳舊，海邊酒店的通病有點黴味不過影響不大，房間很寬敞有55平，一次性拖鞋很厚實，有健身房和游泳池（沒啥特色）
服務：門口有人接車，其他就沒啥主動的服務了
親子：有小童樂園（設施很少衹有海洋球等）
位置：選了高層視野還可以，主要是看不到海，但交通方便去大東海、鹿回頭很近，去第一市場、盒馬鮮生可以直接步行
餐飲：衹吃了早餐，早餐基本的種類都有，有咖啡機，粉面臊子衹有兩種，味道一般，沒有蛋糕🍮，沒有冷切肉類
所有所有都要以花多少錢為基礎，以838兩晚+雙早+自助晚餐（繽紛套餐升級）這個價格，其實很多問題都不算問題了，也是在三亞住的最便宜的地方了，適合想省錢的小夥伴們

服務：
1.遇到了很多人反應的癢癢問題，但是跟前台反應後，態度很好地及時聯繫客房服務員更換了床品，然後就比較舒服了😌
2.訂的是2晚贈送繽紛套餐，餐廳聯繫更換為2大1小的晚餐自助，算是服務升級了吧，哈哈哈
3.早餐水平正常發揮，菜品還是豐富的，咖啡是現磨的，可以做好幾種，蠻好
環境：
1.河對面就是遊船旅遊中心，出海比較方便，其它景點遊玩就是打車啦。不過滴滴基本秒應，可以到了酒店大堂再叫也來得及
2.房間有提示周圍有工地24小時施工，但是我們這幾天不知道停工了還是隔音效果不錯，感覺很安靜

要説最喜歡的，我會説是酒店大堂麼，假山前的小沙發一坐誰也不愛了～
入住當天前台小姐姐給升了房，住在B座19樓，關上陽台門，感覺工地噪音不是很大。房間整體還可以，乾淨整潔，但是設施偏舊是實際性的問題，還有就是感覺有點潮。。。
酒店的早餐和晚餐算是一大敗筆了吧。。。HIG、萬豪、希爾頓的高端品牌也沒少住，這家的餐食真的一言難盡，要啥沒啥，還不主動補，希望以後能有所改善。
最後一天時間有點趕，西西小姐姐給延遲退房兩小時，很棒，謝謝～
有機會的話，還會再來。。。

msg:春節期間酒店漲價都很嚴重，我定的比較早大概一天不到一千，這個價位這個環境我感覺已經很不容易了，這家酒店最優秀的就是離哪兒都近，在三亞灣和海棠灣的中間，去哪兒都不會太麻煩。我們租了一個電瓶車，商家來送車取車，騎車到第一市場或者港華夜市都是十分鐘內。遊艇中心就在對面，尾波沖浪或者出海都非常方便。附近離當地居民生活區很近，可以吃到很地道的小吃，離網紅餐廳也很近。總而言之就是性價比很高，很接地氣的高級酒店了。房間很大，獨立的衣帽間獨立的洗手間沖涼房和浴缸。兩面牆都是玻璃，景觀無敵。

設施：因為三亞太潮濕了確實酒店設施很難維護，能看得出來有一些陳舊但是也是在盡力維護了，乾淨整潔是沒話説的。該有的基本都有了，我入住了六天沒有看到蟲子之類的東西。
衞生：第一天入住馬桶堵了我們直接出門了也沒跟前台説，晚上回來就直接修好了，我帶了一次性浴缸套，每天回來都會收拾好有一股濃濃的消毒水味道。光腳走也不會有沙子或者臟東西。
環境：三樓的空中泳池很乾凈
服務：一般需要耳塞浴巾打完電話十分鐘也就送過來了，出門打車或者回來禮賓也很快就會來開門。行政下午茶的水果會經常換。

這是我們在三亞住的第二間酒店，一家老小住了三間房。
感謝全體員工全程的照料。
在入住酒店前，曾佳桐小姐姐就通過微信聯繫我們。這個好像是洲際的管家服務？
我們有一間房有行政待遇，管家小姐姐知道後，立馬贈送了其他房間每間房一天的行政待遇。
特殊原因，行政待遇在一層三號酒吧使用。
第一天晚上，親子房一面是泳池，有人在泳池旁吃飯喝酒聊天，聲音還不小，跟管家小姐姐溝通後，剩下三天就很安靜啦！
這個管家服務真不錯，回覆是真的很及時，安排的又很貼心。
我們團購的券裏有兩份繽紛假日美食套餐。西餐吧的員工知道後，給我們更新換成了三間房的自助晚餐！我家長者在這裏吃海鮮吃到爽~
一月的天有點冷，但是常温泳池還是有好多人。
真心建議酒店再置備一套恆温泳池，讓小寶寶們也有的玩~
三間房都很大，尤其是親子房。孩子們好喜歡帳篷和小童床的熊貓玩偶~有一點建議：親子房的浴室可否安裝一些更私隱的窗簾，目前的還是能透光，晚上衹能關燈洗澡啦~親子房的衣帽間也很大，行李放進去，留下大屋子給倆孩子徹底的玩耍，也不怕磕碰~
早餐豐富，但是人超多，一定要早去啊。西餐吧還有小童遊樂區，雖然玩具不多，但小寶寶們聚在一塊，就不出來了。
泳池旁的b棟有小童樂園，不大，沒有滑梯，有繪本區和海洋球區，還有小童廁所。可能是臨近過節，人手不足，沒有工作人員，沒啥玩具，我們玩了一會兒就走了。
團購的券裏贈送了接送機，所以最後一天的三亞行，是管家小姐姐安排的酒店的gl8送機服務，滿足了我一大家子的出行。

msg:第二次入住。三亞城裡住着方便，吃飯購物的物價也低一點，價格比海邊便宜，前台Iris服務很好，提前打了電話確認，房間升級了。
優點：酒店品牌口碑好，服務好，衞生好，房間面積大，雖然比城裡其他酒店貴一點，但安全放心，主要是衞生可以保證。出行也方便。
缺點：酒店裝修比較老了，櫃子門也吱嘎，插電的地方都容易松，充電太費勁了，馬桶沖水也不好用。這次來旁邊有工地，晚上也幹活，有點吵。
希望酒店可以翻新一下，以後還會選擇的。

服務：幾乎沒有服務可言…進酒店兩位不知道是保安還是服務生站在一旁冷眼看着你拉行李，就在旁邊立着不動…前台冷冰冰的板著臉也罷了…我們辦理入住比較早，房間沒有打掃出來能理解，告知我們打掃出來後會電話聯繫，結果直到三點我們自己去前台要房卡也沒接到任何電話…
環境：景觀房靠河，隔壁是居民樓，中規中矩但陽台很大！
總體而言不太推薦這家…沒有什麼特色，設施一般服務沒有公區環境也一般
