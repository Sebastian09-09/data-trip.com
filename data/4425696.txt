msg:We had a great four day stay at Eastern House.  The rooms were clean, spacious and comfortable.  Location is ideal and one can walked to most famous sites.  Subway is less than a 10 minute away by foot. Hotel staffs were all helpful,  particularly the kitchen staff at the restaurants where we had our daily breakfast.  Ms Yin (尹改利）and her wonderful kitchen staff were lovely people who helped our elderly friend a great deal.  They carried her plate of food to the table and assisting whenever needs arose.  Breakfast was delicious and has both western and Chinese items.  It was a great way to start the day.

msg:The hotel is old. The lighting throughout the hotel is dim. The lighting in the room itself are soft even though all lights turned on so it was hard to tell whether the carpet,  the bathroom floor, or the bedding are cleaned. Staff are friendly. Hotel is at the great location; Walkable to the City Wall, the Bell Tower, Drum Tower, Muslims Quarter. There are many restaurants nearby. The hotel provides unlimited water bottles. Laundry room has 2 washers and a dryer; it can get busy in early morning or late at night. Breakfast buffet is decent with Chinese and Western foods choices. From the hotel website and Trip.com booking confirmation, it said that hotel provides airport pickup, however, it turned out that they only provide free airport pickup for Mainland Citizens, everyone else, they will charged 150 RMB. which is more expensive than the airport taxi.

msg:Lovely stay at the Eastern House Boutique Hotel. Me, my wife and our 10yr old son stayed in a family room which was spacious, clean and very comfortable. There are laundry facilities available - really helpful if you're travelling through China for a couple of weeks or longer. The staff were really friendly, especially the young man on the front desk who called a taxi for us that we then used for the whole day for our trip the Terracotta Warriors and Qin Shi Huang's mausoleum. We speak pretty decent Chinese but even if you don't, this is a convenient place to stay. The daily afternoon tea included was a nice touch too.

I would like to commend front office staff 孙陆who spent time in helping my wife and I set up WeChat DIDI and giving us his personal number to call at any time if we encountered issues. 

The morning breakfast service staff, 尹改利 and her teammates are happy in serving and awesome, making our 6.30am  breakfast a great start for the day.  Thank you 尹改利 & your colleagues for the wonderful breakfast mornings. Eastern House is fortunate to have such hardworking and enthusiastic employees.  The welcoming experiences at 东舍 would be a draw for our next visit to 西安. 

高标准的服务对于提供客户体验至关重要。我要赞扬前台孙陆的帮助以及早餐时尹改利和她的同事们友好服务。你们让我在西安的住宿成为一次美好的经历。

The hotel is at a convenient location and its staffs are really motivated to do good work. 张瑞娥，武玲敏 served our room and they did excellent job. The restaurant staff 王香娥 and 尹改利also provided excellent service when we had meals at the restaurant. My only negative impression is that one of my booked nonsmoking rooms had clear smell of smoke.

msg:Here's writing a much overdue review of our stay at Eastern House during our time spent in Xian.

Eastern House is a boutique hotel tucked away along Fenxiang lane, about a 10min walk away from the hustle and bustle of the main Nanda street. Fenxiang lane also includes a number of eateries and convenience stores that allow one to buy daily necessities. 

The location is very convenient as it sits away from the noise of the main street but yet is within a 10min 15min walk away from the main Line 2 Zhonglou station, or Line 6 Guang Ji Jie station. This makes the nearby Bell Tower (Zhonglou) attractions easily accessible including the Huimin Jie (Muslim Street) tourist spot.

We had a mixed bag of experience with the rooms that looked a little dated in the interior. The deluxe room assigned was a little dusty though the family room with 3 beds was well maintained.

What made up for it was the wonderful team of staff we encountered during our stay that were forthcoming and helpful. These included staff at the cafeteria, front desk as well as house keeping. A special shout out to the following people I remembered as going out their way to ensure we had a smooth stay. David Han, Terry Li, Emma Wang, Candy Tian, Sun Lu, 陈佳珧, 尹改利, 王红梅, 王建荣, the Cantonese Chef, the lovely lady that headed the front desk, not to mention the young lady that showed our family to the rooms when we arrived late after midnight. There were many others I cannot list in entirety.

Thank you for the excellent service that remains in the hearts of our family. It is indeed true that the people of Xian are 热情洋溢， 踏实可爱。We look forward to visiting Xian again including Eastern House.

Unfortunately we had to accept a room with two single beds as there was no nonsmoking double bed rooms available, we then found out the aircon did not have cooling function due to the time of our stay, however this is not then fault of hotel staff. 

However the most disappointing part is the toilet would not flush properly. We been told it happens some rooms. Hmmm unlucky maybe .

He accompanied us to the nearby hospital, facilitating a smooth access to the medical facilities, especially in communicating with hospital staff.  He stayed with us during the different stations we had to go for diagnosis, xray, ct scan, treatment and getting the medications from the pharmacy.

We believe he is and will be an invaluable member of the team at the hotel with the kind hospitality he showed us.

There was not much for us to say about the other facilities at the hotel because we had no time to use them. The free afternoon tea and snacks were a pleasant surprise, and our simple dinner for that one night was delightful.  

My wife and I would like to return there when I have recovered and continue to experience the rest of Xian that ended abruptly.

Service was friendly and efficient.  House cleaning was great, and even folded some of my clothes scatter all over lol. 
Breakfast was delicious with good options, and more importantly decent coffee. While there's Starbucks and other chains all over the city, sometimes it's just nice to have with the breakfast.  You'd be surprised how that's actually not as common as you'd imagined.
The location is not the best for access to Metro station, but the area is very lively and quite walkable just for an evening stroll.   There are plenty of restaurants, malls and Sephora for some emergency skincare items if needed.  There is a decent haircut place and also a proper post office nearby. During my latest stay, honestly it's much easier and very very affordable to just call an Didi (uber-equivalent) to get around.  
Will stay again at this hotel  if I'm ever in the City in the future.  While I did see some wear and tear in the unit, it's overall maintained quite well, and honestly for the prices, always a very good deal.

Hotel itself has nice design and rooms are comfortable and in good shape, cleaning was overall good and it was quiet at night. Not a huge fan of the semi-open bathroom though and the minifridge doesnt really cool. Breakfast was quite limited compared to the big Western chains but no big deal for us.

But sadly when I got there, I was informed that the afternoon tea had stopped because of covid. This information wasnt stated on the website or on trip at my time of booking. Very disappointed!

The location wasnt the best as it was rather far from the nearest subway metro station. Next time I come back I'd rather stay nearer the metro.

That said, it was a good location for food, and I guess if you are going to didi around, then no issue with it being far from the station. Rooms were great, but honestly for this price, I dont think it's particularly worth it. Breakfast was ordinary.

msg:Great location--walkable from a lot of tourist spots and several good places to eat and drink. The staff was super helpful and helped me several times with special requests. Their English is a bit more limited than at some other top name brand hotels I've stayed at but they always seemed to have at least one English speaker within reach. My room was clearly labeled as a nonsmoking room but I did think I caught the smelled of some residual cigarette smoke at one point. It didn't last long but I wasn't sure if it was through the vents or just because I had my window open and the smell came from the street. People who are very sensitive might want to check on their smoking policy and/or keep windows closed.

I would definitely stay here again.

The hotel is very close to the Zhuba City Snack Street. There are many delicious and fun things nearby. Even if you come back late, there are a lot of midnight snacks to eat! Very convenient! The hotel is a short walk away from the subway station, which is very convenient to the Terracotta Warriors, Huaqing Pool, Datang City and other attractions! The room is spacious and bright. Because the room is right next to the residential building, it is very quiet at night, suitable for friends with light sleep. We lived on the 11th floor of the hotel. The floor housekeepers Cai Qiufang and Wang Jianrong on the 11th floor were particularly responsible, warm and thoughtful service, and amiable attitude. When they met in the aisle of the floor, they would greet enthusiastically and ask if they needed help, consult opinions and suggestions. Thank you for the enthusiastic service of the two floor housekeepers! I strongly recommend Dongshe Hotel! I will choose here next time!

Facilities: The infrastructure is quite satisfactory

Service: I have to say something about the service. Sister Wang Xiaoyun and a sister surnamed Wu chatted with them because I went out late and said that it was strange why the pillows in the hotel were all soft and high, and I was not used to sleeping and felt uncomfortable. Then they changed our pillows that day and specially got a latex pillow for the child, and specifically told me that it was for the child

Warm Spring Exclusive Afternoon Tea: We only had afternoon tea for one day, but the quality was good. It can't be compared with luxury hotels, but it is also very conscientious

I have been to Xi'an for the fourth time, and I was very happy to stay in this hotel this time

Because it is located in the center of the old city, not only is it convenient to go to various attractions, but it also has airport pick-up and drop-off services. So I finally stayed at this hotel.
   As soon as I entered the hotel, a beautiful woman immediately greeted me and asked if I could help. At that time, I was moved by her sincere and gentle smile. Thinking I've come to the right place. Soon, the beauties at the front desk enthusiastically and quickly helped me complete the procedures. The "Min" beauty also sent me to the room and enthusiastically introduced various facilities and precautions for going out.
     Because the old woman was traveling alone. The beauties were particularly caring, introduced various attractions, asked me about my personal intentions, and recommended itineraries for me to choose from. It's really very comforting.
    The facilities are warm and welcoming. The room was clean and tidy. The environment is quiet amidst the hustle and bustle. great accessibility.
     Not only is the customer service quality of Dongshe Hotel high, but the quality of the cleaning staff is also amazing. Because I am blind, I can't tell the difference between east, west and north. The cleaning lady saw that I couldn't figure it out, so she took me directly to the end of the passage and pointed to "Xi'an Construction Bank" in the distance outside the window to show me the way.
   Unfortunately, I don't know their job numbers. I arrived on the afternoon of the 17th. Probably called (Xie Min, *Jing)

The hotel is in a very good location, very close to the Bell Tower, Drum Tower, Muslim Street, and the city wall, and can be reached on foot. If you want to visit the city center for the first time in Xi'an, this is the hotel you must choose. There are also Kaiyuan Mall, snacks, Internet celebrity restaurants, and barbecues around. Takeout and taxis are very convenient. There are takeout robots! The hotel is very design-oriented, unlike other large five-star hotels that are purely luxurious. The decoration style is the style I like, with a dark feeling and a lot of feeling. The mattress in the room is very comfortable, which should be a brand mattress. There is also free mineral water in the room. I have to give a big thumbs up to the service!!! Manager Li from the front office will add us on WeChat to ask about the situation when we checked in. After leaving the store, he will ask for our opinions and suggestions again, and pay attention to the problems we encountered! The just-right service is really super considerate. As long as an employee meets us, they will take the initiative to help me press the elevator and say hello. I have experienced the feeling of being at home!!! If compared with five-star hotels, the breakfast is not very varied, but it can fully meet the breakfast needs of normal people. A roujiamo and a bowl of noodles are basically enough. There are few varieties, but there are still many Shaanxi specialties. After all, the price-performance ratio is here! ! ! To sum up: Dongshe Hotel is the TOP1 in terms of price-performance ratio among hotels of the same type and location! ! ! I really recommend it

It is also very close to the North Courtyard Gate. The decoration is in a light luxury style, and the overall feeling is very comfortable. There are people on the third floor of the hotel every afternoon. There are good quality refreshments, and you can make your own tea in the room, which is very friendly to me, a tea lover. Let’s focus on the hotel’s service. Because we were traveling with an elderly person, he fell ill and had a fever on the first night he arrived and was unable to go out. After learning about the situation, the hotel’s manager Zhu and the cleaning lady on the 9th floor promptly sent a thermometer and antipyretics. The old man was sick and had no appetite. The service butler Sun Xiaolu also specially sent porridge. I would like to express my gratitude to the hotel management and service team. I will definitely stay at Dongshe next time I go to Xi'an👍

The check-in procedure was very fast, and the front desk service was very good. As soon as we arrived in the lobby, the staff gave us a cup of fruit tea, and specifically told us that the children we brought could also drink it. It was a drink without additives (very thoughtful consideration)
When we arrived at the door, we happened to meet the manager who was supposed to be the guest room. He very enthusiastically guided us to the room. The room was spacious, clean and comfortable. The temperature in Xi'an was low when we arrived. He reminded us that snow was forecast for the next day, so we had to arrange sufficient time in advance when we went out. I specially called the foreman Liu and the floor housekeeper Aunt Xiang'e to help me turn on the air conditioner and humidifier, and brought snacks, drinks, water, slippers, and children's dental kits to the children. I was really pleasantly surprised. When we made the reservation, we were always worried that the hotel would not be the type we like. We can see the Zen style of the hotel corridor, the comfortable mattresses, the wet and dry toilets and shower rooms, and the free laundry room. From the hotel's facilities maintenance Looking at it, I really can’t tell that this is a hotel that opened in 2016. And it can be seen that the hotel staff are very attentive to their work.
I also have to praise the breakfast. There are many categories. I didn’t count them carefully, but the whole family was really satisfied. The breakfast buffet actually has service staff who pay attention to what the children like to eat. Helped to get things, the original plan to try some snacks outside was cancelled, because there is also breakfast, Western food, and the freshly ground coffee is very pure^_^
All in all, it was a very satisfying trip. If I plan to come to Xi'an in the future, I will definitely choose Dongshe Hotel again.

msg:The service is very good. Thanks to the enthusiastic service of the front office manager Li. After booking the room, he called us to recommend the must-see tourist attractions in Xi'an. It was very detailed. By the way, he helped us book a private room in the hotel restaurant. Although after successfully booking the private room, we went During the meal, the restaurant staff may have overbooked the reservation, resulting in the reserved private room not being entered, but they worked very hard to help coordinate one. It was a small episode, but this private room did not have a bathroom, which was not very convenient. The flight to the hotel was late, Manager Li They also helped us coordinate our arrival time so that we could check in smoothly. We were given an exclusive gift when we were about to leave, and the service was perfect. We booked 5 rooms for three nights in Xi'an this time and chose this hotel all the time. The main reason is that it is very close to the attractions and the city center, only a 10-minute walk away. Manager Li has also been following up on our needs during our stay. Thank you very much.

What is particularly worth mentioning is Ms. Yin Gaili in the restaurant. The service is really considerate and made us feel at home. The hotel's afternoon tea may seem cozy, but it doesn't mean much. Guests usually go out during the designated afternoon tea time, so it is recommended that guests enjoy it in the form of a snack set without time slots. In fact, who cares about these things, but it shows the hotel’s intentions!

I didn't have time to take pictures, so I only took pictures of the Chris**as decorations in the lobby at the entrance. The room is the same as their official photo.

The room was arranged very well. There was a little hiccup at the beginning but it was resolved quickly. The room was large and the stay was very comfortable.

The location is very convenient. It is only a few minutes walk to the Drum Tower, Bell Tower, and Muslim Street. It is very convenient. There are many delicious restaurants nearby, and I have checked in a lot of what I want to eat.

The service is really good, from giving guides and check-in guides before check-in, to helping with luggage when you first arrive at the door, to helping with check-out, and helping with luggage when seeing you off.

Special thanks to Emma, ​​Coco and Cici~

I will definitely come back next time I come to Xi'an!

P.S. A small suggestion, it would be nice if you could add a light in the middle of the roof. It would be a little bit darker. Personal preference is to make it brighter. It varies from person to person.

When I moved to Dayan Tower, the traffic was much better. It is convenient to go to the Bell and Drum Tower City Wall. It is in a neighborhood similar to a village in the city. There are some small shops nearby. It is not convenient overall and it is quite far from the subway.
The lighting in the room was very dim, as was the interior of the hotel, and the atmosphere felt a bit depressing. The service at check-in was average.
The main reason is that the location is not as convenient as expected, and it is too dark.

There are so many delicious places around. I recommended many friends to stay there. When they didn’t stay, they told me that I was the hotel’s caretaker. After checking in, they all said that I would choose the hotel😀. The room equipment and facilities are definitely not inferior to those of a five-star hotel. The space is large, the style is elegant, and the details reveal the operator's intention and taste. Snacks in the room are free, there is a huge water tank at the elevator, and drinking water is free. I like to cook Roujiamo for the free breakfast. The small and crispy buns are filled with the aroma of noodles and meat. One bite makes me feel full of happiness. The unexpected surprise is that there is free afternoon tea. This store is so considerate. I happened to be tired and hungry after going out for a walk. It is such a tasteful hotel that gives you a sense of ceremony in every aspect. It is my first choice whenever I pass through Xi'an every time I travel to the northwest. Goodbye Xi'an, see you next time - Dongshe.

Hygiene: Just press it before going out to clean up, and the staff will clean up and fill up the missing items when you come back.
Environment: Personally, I think it is above the mid-range. It's just that I don't sleep very well at night, sometimes I hear a few traffic sounds, but overall it is relatively quiet. The sound insulation effect in the corridor is average, sometimes you can hear the noise of children.
The service was excellent! Because I had a fever when I came out, the hotel staff immediately asked about the situation, delivered meals, and boiled hot water. And ask if there is any other discomfort, and if there is any discomfort, accompany him to the nearby hospital. As a special matter, in order for me to eat and take medicine as soon as possible, I asked my child to pack breakfast. Thank you Yin Gaili, Lu Ani and Annie and the staff, you have worked hard!
Self-service afternoon tea: I went out to play during the day and didn't eat.
Breakfast: Personally, I think there are quite a lot of varieties, and the children are very happy to eat.

4. The hotel has its own restaurant, the food is served very slowly, the taste is okay, quite satisfactory, the service is very average, basically rely on reminders;
5. The location of the hotel is not convenient. It is convenient to take a taxi. Don’t count on the subway. There is nothing to eat nearby.

Turn left from the hotel and go straight to the South Street, the Bell Tower. Next to the Bell Tower is the Muslim Street. It is also convenient to eat around. There is an Internet celebrity Bell Tower community check-in, and delicious food in the residential area. A lot too! The hotel has a dedicated person to follow up the service. After booking, the front office manager Li added WeChat and sent a lot of information about travel and surrounding transportation. On the day of check-in, he also helped us personally guide us to the location of the parking lot. Due to the check-in time, It was just after afternoon tea time, and the child was very disappointed. After hearing the news, Manager Li immediately packaged the afternoon tea for our child and sent it to the room. The child was very surprised and very happy. In the evening, he wanted to have some midnight snacks and helped us. They introduced delicious restaurants near the hotel and were very efficient. This stay experience is absolutely perfect! ! !

msg:The family chose a hotel for a long time before their summer vacation, and they were not disappointed when they arrived at the store. The whole is simple and low-key. There is nothing to say about hygiene. The two young ladies Mika and Nicy at the front desk are kind and thoughtful, and they always reply to some questions in the first time. The booked room has breakfast and afternoon tea. Sister Yin Gaili of the restaurant is full of enthusiasm every day. As soon as she arrives at the restaurant during the four days of her stay, she can see her smiling face, as well as Sister Lu and Annie. Greeted warmly every day, helped lead the table, and introduced the meals of the day. Breakfast and afternoon tea are different every day. The rich breakfast makes us full of energy for a day of travel. Because we have children, we chose the non-smoking floor. Sister Jia on the 11th floor is also very amiable. Not only will she greet each other every day, but she will also ask if the room needs to be cleaned and replenish water, drinks and snacks in the room in time. Generally speaking, we feel like coming home for our holidays. I highly recommend "Dongshe". Next time I come to Xi'an, I will choose here again. The address here is very good, and it is very convenient to go anywhere. Buses, subways, taxis, and shared bicycles are all within easy reach.

I compared the room area with other hotels online and the room size was quite large. They looked good and I placed an order. After arriving at the store, the front desk enthusiastically prepared hot tea for us, and parking was free. The front desk staff are very enthusiastic. They greeted us with a smile as soon as we entered the door. Manager Li from the front office added WeChat and made a phone call to introduce us to the nearest routes to surrounding attractions, tourist attractions, local food, and also gave us transportation routes to take the subway around. You can refer to it when traveling, but the temperature of this room is a little low. Finally, Manager Li helped coordinate a room change. Because he was in a hurry to go out, he even helped me pack my luggage and got a new room. It was very efficient and fast. Originally I decided to stay for one day and then checked out, and finally extended my stay for another day. The buffet breakfast also included local specialties Zeng Gao, Roujiamo, etc. The facilities are complete, including a free laundry room, a gym, and humidifiers and Bluetooth speakers in the room. This time I had good food and fun, and a good stay. There are also a lot of snacks near the hotel at night, all of which are delicious. Next time I will stay here again if I come back.

He provided 2 rooms on the same floor, as well as children's pedals and children's toiletries. He also helped after staying. We also coordinated the children's bathrobes. During the stay, Manager Li also helped solve a lot of things. The room temperature was a little slow to rise and it was a little cold when taking a shower. Because I brought the children to the hotel for breakfast, I suggest that bread and pastries can be exchanged. For a change, the hotel has free afternoon tea, which is not bad. The location is also very good, the transportation is convenient, and there are many places to eat nearby. The hotel is very efficient in dealing with problems. It is recommended to stay here.

The services in all aspects are very good, the doorman is very proactive, and the check-in staff and manager in the lobby are very nice.

Manager Li in the front office has very good service. After adding WeChat, problems will be solved in time, which is very praiseworthy.

Although the hotel is a bit far from the Tang Dynasty Sleepless City, it is very close to the Bell and Drum Towers. It is very convenient to travel.

I feel that the hotel environment is very good and the facilities are great. It is also complete, the gym is also good, there is free afternoon tea, the hotel breakfast is very rich, we especially like the roujiamo in the breakfast.

In addition, the hair dryer is so good, it will stop automatically after a few seconds of blowing. I went to the front desk, and the older sister at the front desk explained that the hair dryer has automatic protection, and the temperature is too high. High will automatically power off. But who doesn’t have a hair dryer? Which hair dryer can protect itself after blowing for 10 seconds. Needless to say, I have long hair, and my husband’s short hair can’t be blown dry.

Afternoon tea buffet: very average. The breakfast is like an express hotel, with no special features or grades.
Although this wine has a sense of design, but the texture is not good, and I can't bear to look at it carefully.
Advantages: Disposable low-consumption items are not bad. Mineral water can be taken at will.

Every time I go to Xi’an, I always want to stay at the Dongshe Hotel in Fenxiang for two nights because the surrounding area is so convenient for dining and sightseeing. Especially this time I experienced the Dongshe Hotel. The way Dongshe handles guests' follow-up questions is very good. The warm and considerate service Dongshe gave me brought me a better mood during this trip. I only booked a room for one night during the weekend. When I came here, the room was I was also very nervous. When I extended my stay, the hotel upgraded the room for free. Moreover, the floor service staff Wang Xiaoyun and the quality inspector Xu Zhongqin were so enthusiastic in serving the guests that they felt as warm as home. This was a heartfelt compliment. It has become a habit to stay in Dongshe for two days when visiting Xi'an.

Environment: So-so, outside the window is a high-rise building in the community, you need to draw the curtains to pay attention to privacy. The location is okay, but it's not convenient to park at the door, and it's a little far from the subway station.

Facilities: a little old, low level of intelligence, curtains are not electric, bedside sockets are relatively few, and there is no usb socket, TV buttons are not sensitive, hair dryer is relatively poor

Three or four hundred is more than expected, and five or six hundred is appropriate, but the price of two or three times during the holidays is a bit too much. It's not worth it compared to the hotel of the same price we stayed in the first and second days of our vacation.

The service is very enthusiastic. Since the trip was relatively early, they also packed breakfast for us. The hotel's takeaway is delivered by a small robot upstairs, and there is mineral water in the corridor freezer. I heard that there is also a self-service laundry room, but we didn't go, but this alone proves that we are very thoughtful. There are some snacks downstairs in the hotel. It is about 10 minutes away from the city wall. The appearance of the hotel is relatively low-key, but the inside is very clean and the facilities are relatively new. I will recommend friends to stay next time. By the way, the hotel has thoughtfully prepared afternoon tea. For those who have played for a day, it is very friendly to come back in the afternoon. Children like it very much~

Knowing that I would check out early on the second day, I told the front desk in advance that I would like an invoice. The front desk also asked me to add WeChat and told me to just send the message to him directly. Neither the front desk nor WeChat gave me any instructions before departure. I had to go to the front desk to get it. When I checked out, I was not told to get an invoice. It wasn't until I ran out ten minutes ago that I was asked to get an invoice. Then I was told to send an invoice, but it was sent payable on delivery. Is it all the fault of the guest? You don't have one? I often come to Xi'an for business trips and will never stay here again.

Then the most unbearable thing is the toilet! ! ! ! ! ! Square, do you know why most toilets in the world are oval? Because that conforms to the structure of the human body. Square toilet, I see it for the first time! The caliber of the toilet is very short at the front and back, and it cannot be both large and small when you sit on it, do you understand? When I was a big size, a boy’s ***** could only be stuck on the inner wall in front of the toilet. It was so disgusting and uncomfortable. I won't describe it, it's very inconvenient anyway! What **** anti-human design. In addition to these, the location of the hotel is good. Although it takes about 15 minutes to walk to the Bell Tower, it is convenient to go to various scenic spots. The hygiene is okay, the auntie cleaned it very clean, and I didn't encounter the phenomenon that the socket was too loose as mentioned in the comment area.

Going out is Dachejia Lane, a lot of delicious food, and Defu Lane (I don’t know how the bar is in it now), not far from the Bell Tower Huimin Street, and it’s no problem to walk there.

The sanitation is particularly poor. As soon as you enter the door, you can see various stains on the kitchen door, which are oily.
There is a lot of dust on the bedside table, and there is a lot of graffiti on the back of the card... The socket is always falling off if it is not plugged in firmly... The TV is full of dust, and there is a dating app in the same city on the home page of the TV. I am really speechless...
The sound insulation is poor, you can hear the cleaners talking outside...
The hotel lobby and rooms are dark and depressing.…
The weather of 27 degrees does not turn on the air conditioner, and the sleep is full of sweat...
breakfast is also very general
In short, sorry for the price, it is not as good as a chain hotel

Check-in was quick, and a deposit of 500 yuan was charged, which was returned soon after leaving the store. There is a robot that delivers food, very cute. When the robot is busy, the takeaway boy will put it on a table dedicated to takeaway at the front desk, and it needs to be picked up by itself. There is a special mineral water cabinet next to the elevator, and the water is available in unlimited quantities on demand. The next day left early, the front desk helped to pack breakfast (snacks, yogurt, eggs, milk, apples, etc.). There is also a breakfast window in Chunfao near 7:00 in the morning. There are steamed stuffed buns and drinks, which are also delicious. The cleaning lady who met in the corridor will take the initiative to say hello to us. The front desk reception is very warm and courteous. There is a hospital next to the hotel that has an emergency depar**ent at night, and it takes only three to five minutes to walk there. My friend felt unwell at night. After seeing the emergency depar**ent, it was about 5 o’clock in the morning. I asked the staff on duty for some salt. At that time, the little brother ran to the restaurant without hesitation, and at the same time let us go back to the room to rest. After a while I delivered it myself, and told them to tell them if it was not enough, thank you very much! The only downside to the hotel is that it's about 10 minutes from the subway.

The transportation is very convenient. It is a 700-meter walk to the Drum Tower, Huimin Street, and Bell Tower. It is not too far away from the city wall of Yongning Gate Far. It is worth mentioning that in terms of food, in addition to the well-known "Dongshe ****ang" that comes with the hotel, next door to the west is the well-known Chinese time-honored brand, a century-old shop "Chunfa", Hulutou Paomo and Bangbang Pork Try it; turn the east side to "Drunken Chang'an" Shaanxi restaurant, the first place in the review, and the queue starts at 11:00 noon. I didn't eat it this time, so I have a little regret; go north along Zhuba City and there is Mrs. Yang Steamed buns, Lao Li's biangbiang noodles, etc., rich choices and a short distance can all be the reasons for choosing this place. ✪ω✪ Hand-drawn maps are nice.
Disadvantages: The underground parking spaces of the hotel are relatively tight and narrow, and the parking spaces in non-independent buildings of the hotel are only designated for part of the area. Drivers should pay attention.

Sanitation facilities: The sanitation is overall clean and tidy, but it can be seen that the cabinets at the entrance have been not wiped for a long time, and there is serious dust accumulation, and there are blood stains on the quilt cover (it should be a special case)
Service: The cleaning lady cleaned up in a timely manner. After staying for four nights, I came back to the hotel every night very tidy. The front desk is also very satisfied, and the luggage storage arrangement is very appropriate. If you don't want to go downstairs to order takeaway, there will be robots delivering it to your door.
Facilities: Generally speaking, it is qualified. But here are two suggestions. 1. The plug is aging and loose. Remember to check it. The bedside plug I stayed in cannot be used because it is loose. 2. There is no luggage rack in the big bed room, and the boxes can only be piled behind the door. To get things, they need to be spread out and placed in the door and toilet, which is very inconvenient every time you go in and out.
Overall: high cost performance, unique design and considerate service.

msg:The service is extremely poor. When I first arrived at the hotel to check in, there were at least 4 waiters at the front desk. No one greeted me, not even a welcome person. They were busy chatting. When I asked more than twice is check in here? Only then did someone receive him.

Room service is also extremely poor. When I found that I didn’t have enough toothbrushes, I asked the front desk to ask for them. At least by the time I left the house in the morning, the toothbrushes hadn’t been delivered yet.

After checking out, the luggage was stored in the hotel. The hotel later called us and said that our phone watch was left in the room. I said please put it with our luggage for me and we would take it away together, and they agreed. Because we had a late flight, we went directly to Didi to pick up our luggage. When we arrived at the airport, we found that the phone watch was still not placed in the luggage. We called them for a long time to confirm where it was. After an hour or two, the reply came back and was still forgotten at the front desk. Forgot to put it. And said they would send it via SF Express and they would bear the shipping cost. I have received the watch now, but the shipping cost is payable on collect. It's not bad. The shipping fee is 19 yuan, but the service of the hotel that doesn't do what it says is very poor.

msg:Stayed at this hotel for 4 nights, I will tell you the pros and cons.
First of all, next to this hotel is the First Hospital of Shaanxi City. Although it is said that there are nucleic acid points around, you may not meet them when they are open. After all, you are traveling, so you can't squat and open the nucleic acid point on purpose. The epidemic situation It will be very convenient to choose if there is a hospital next door to do nucleic acid testing at any time.
In addition, it is not far from the clock tower. The advantage is that it is really quiet and there are relatively few people. Basically, we all go out on bicycles these days, and we bought a 7-day bicycle package from Meituan. Especially when I come back late from Huashan or Huaqing Palace, the cars I take are all getting off near the Bell Tower, and I will go back to the hotel by bicycle from there. Although it's okay to walk, but if you are tired from playing that day, you must be in pain when you get off the subway or get off the bus and walk back to this hotel. We all weigh the pros and cons of this.
Then the hotel service is really good, mineral water is available! In addition to the mineral water in the room, there are also many corridors and aisles, both at room temperature and ice, all of which are free of charge. And going back to the hotel to take the elevator is only through the hotel lobby, this privacy is very good.
In addition, I would like to express my dissatisfaction:
1. On the first night, there was no hot water when taking a shower at night! I called and said it was repairing, I didn't know what time I got it, and then I didn't inform in advance, I just took a cold shower😭😭😭
2. The TV does not have a screen projection function. If you like to use the voting function, please pay attention!
3. There is only one chair in the room, we had breakfast in the room on the last morning and ordered a takeaway. We can only move the desk out to the bed, one on the bed and one on the chair. sigh..

There are others, good and bad, which are not within my scope of consideration and do not affect my mood, so I won't say anything else.

I didn't take pictures of the hotel, I just uploaded three photos for the sake of points.

The price is not high, it should be a business hotel, not a traditional five-star hotel. Maybe it's because the guests are too busy, and the management of entry and exit during the epidemic is not strict.

You can get bottled water at will. The breakfast is a bit downgrading the hotel, not to mention the variety of meals It is limited, the quantity is not enough, there are too many people, and the food supply cannot keep up.

I couldn’t press the elevator by myself, and it was impossible to go to the lobby You have to call and swipe your card. If the phone is out of battery, you can't get on. What kind of garbage settings... I called the front desk at night and asked for a set of children's toiletries. I couldn't deliver it at 12 o'clock, and I called the front desk again and said it was busy. But let's wait, wait until 1:00 and then call the front desk, but no one answered it. This situation in a hotel of this price is really intoxicating. I booked a parent-child room that costs almost 800 a night. Is it children's things? Shouldn't it appear directly in the room? ? ? I don’t want to complain about the lack of breakfast varieties. Staying in hotels all over the country has the worst experience. There is no one.

I didn’t think it would be too pleasant to live. I didn’t expect it to be a surprise. I stayed for another day. The location of the hotel is good. Convenient to travel, close to the Bell Tower, Drum Tower, Muslim Street, and the city wall. The surrounding area is full of food. When you check in, you will be given a hand-painted map guide. The room is clean and tidy, quiet and comfortable, especially the service is enthusiastic. The floor attendant Xu Aiqin's service is particularly good. I greeted her warmly every time I saw her, and asked her about her travel route and snacks she wanted to eat, and I warmly recommended it. It really made her feel at home. Highly recommended, I will choose Dongshe when I come to Xi'an in the future!

msg:I rarely write bad reviews for hotels. I really don't know how to rate the five-diamond standard on Ctrip. I just want to ask if you have done room soundproofing and hygiene tests? I checked in on February 7th and 8th. First of all, on the 8th, the waiter did not clean the room thoroughly during the day. In the corner of the bathroom where the electronic scale was placed, the bags of black tea kicked out of the trash could not be cleaned, and the table in the room was not cleaned. Wipe, secondly, the sound insulation effect is very poor. I fell asleep at 10:00 p.m. on the 8th, and was woken up 4 times. The guests in the next room were noisy and laughing, and there were continuous sounds of opening and closing doors. The front desk called to solve it, but it didn't work. When I called the front desk for the second time, the front desk said to help me change the room and rest. , I have to catch the high-speed train at 8 o'clock in the morning. I called the front desk for the third time and the fourth time to inform the front desk of my request, which has seriously affected my sleep. If it can't be solved, I will call the police. Finally, the front desk apologized and asked the manager on duty to come up to the next room. After communicating again, it was already around three in the morning when I fell asleep again. In short, the experience of staying in is very poor. I will not choose this hotel again in the future. I didn’t sleep well in the morning after catching the high-speed train, which made me physically and mentally exhausted, which seriously affected the state of the day. I must give a bad review. ! ! !

The room service is also very thoughtful and meticulous. I praise the foreman Liu, Zhang Yaqin, Ma Guiying, He Ning, Liu Ping, and help us dry the clothes and send them to the room every day. If we leave a message, we feel very warm. It is very tiring to come out and help us solve The trouble of washing and pushing clothes after a trip.

At night, you can stroll around and watch the performances at the Datang Evernight City Pedestrian Street. Because here is quite far away from the Big Wild Goose Pagoda.

2. The hotel is clean and hygienic. As soon as you enter the lobby, a faint fragrance comes out, the room is clean and tidy, and there are snacks to give away. The minor flaw is that the faucet in the room that stayed in the rain can't hang up.
3. The hotel is very close to the Bell Tower, Drum Tower, City Wall and Muslim Street. We all went to the attractions on foot.
4. The breakfast in the hotel is quite satisfactory, and there are also special snacks in Shaanxi, which are generally good.
5. The free afternoon tea provided by the hotel is very considerate, which makes your waiting at check-in become very leisurely. A hand-drawn map makes you feel the nuances of the hotel.
Staying at Dongshe Hotel is a highlight of this Xi'an tour. It is also a good memory!

Ctrip Shangdongshe is the most popular hotel near the Bell and Drum Tower. I want to know more about some questions. I contacted the front desk in all aspects. From the time I hung up the call at the front desk to recommend the Thunderstorm Butler, I decided to book this hotel. Not only did I pick up and recommend professional room types, but also added Thunderstorm Butler on WeChat, so hurry up. I have a professional tour guide in Xi’an. From the itinerary to the reservation of tickets for various attractions, you don’t need to worry about everything by yourself. You only need to make a request. The most professional and fastest way to give the corresponding arrangements and answers immediately, regardless of the size, people Before I arrived in Xi'an, I felt the hospitality, honesty and kindness of the people of Xi'an, which also added a lot to the next trip to Xi'an! 👍👍👍
7.6 Staying in a hotel, I feel a great sense of peace of mind for choosing Dongshe Hotel. Zhang Chuxi at the front desk, butler Lei Yu, kind greetings, we will arrange all the arrangements for the next day and the driver in advance. On the first day before people check in, the butler Lei Yu went to buy the most authentic Xi'an snacks, let us be the first I ate pure specialty snacks just in time, and when I returned late, I would also give away small snacks and drinks, which immediately wiped out the troubles caused by traffic jams.
Let me focus on the hotel's catering. The next day I went to the Terracotta Warriors and Horses Huaqing Pool. After watching the camel bell performance, I was tired and sun-dried. I wanted to eat near the hotel. I went back to my room and rested. The driver recommended the Dongshe Canteen on the third floor of the hotel. Oh 😉), the result was unexpectedly delicious! Ziyang steamed bowls, Dongshe ribs, Xiangma Liangpi, mixed pepper fish...you must eat it! Trust me! delicious! I pay a lot of attention to food. No matter how good a hotel environment is, the breakfast buffet is also very good. The freshly cooked noodles must be eaten. It is super delicious, no less than the professional noodle restaurants outside!
In short, the experience is very good, the hotel staff is also very nice, the service is also good, happy, recommended👍👍👍

The environment is good and the service is also very good, especially the auntie Lou Guan: Wang Xiaoyun, Qu Aiqin, it really is. The warm, caring and good service made our family full of praise. It was the first time I met such a good auntie who was traveling so many places! Let us be very heartwarming in this strange city! And thank you for the snacks!

msg:The hotel is located near the Bell and Drum Tower, it is very convenient for eating, lodging and transportation. The hotel service is very attentive. On the day of check-in, we knew that we had a kid, and immediately provided children's utensils and a snack basket, which made the kid very happy. At breakfast the next day, Xiao Guo, the director of the restaurant, saw that the children were not eating well and knew that we were going to the Hukou Scenic Area. He thoughtfully prepared a fruit snack for the children and took them on the road. The hotel is very close to the Bell and Drum Tower, Muslim Street and the ancient city wall. At night, you can walk to see the night view, or take the subway to Datang Everbright City to see the night view and performance. There are 2 well-known restaurants around the hotel, which are very popular, and the boutique Shaanxi restaurant in the hotel also tastes good. Although the hotel room is a bit small, it is neat and clean and worth staying in.

The front desk attendants Liu Ying, Chu Er, Jiale, Lei Yu and other girls enthusiastically introduced us to the check-in instructions. We waited until we arrived. The room felt even more like home. The room attendants Qu Aiqin, Wang Xiaoyun, Ma Ying, and Zhu Afang tried their best to meet our various requests, especially Qu Aiqin. My little princess liked her very much. We are very satisfied with the hotel we stayed in this time! Next time I come to Xi'an, I will choose to stay at Dongshe Hotel.

The staff are very enthusiastic. The front desk Zhao Xiao, Zhao Ya, and Lei Yu presented our children with breakfast and delivered luggage to the room. The restaurant director Guo and Yin Gaili introduced the features very warmly. I also helped to get the meal, and the guest room Wang Xiaoyun Qu Aiqin left a caring card after sanitation. In short, although the facilities and listed five-star ratio are slightly insufficient, it is still a very good choice

Zhao Xiao, Xiaohong, Sun Lu, Zhao Ya, Jiale are all enthusiastic and professional; 3F restaurant Breakfast, afternoon tea and dinner are also delicious. The waiters Yin Xiaojuan, Yin Meili, Lu Ani, Guo Jianwei, Wang Yan, and Hou Xifeng are all very enthusiastic. They not only took the initiative to introduce us to the food, but also saw the children take care of them. They did not enjoy them at the five-star hotels. After such a warm service; I took the initiative to deliver brown sugar ginger tea to the room when I came back from the rain; I am so touched! Room housekeepers Wang Xiang'e and Qu Aiqin not only deliver delicious snacks and drinks to the children every day; even low and normal temperature mineral water is distributed by the corridor stairs for guests to take at any time! The location of the hotel is also very good. You can walk to the Bell and Drum Tower and Muslim Street with your children. It is definitely a very good hotel for traveling in Xi'an.

After you check in, they will be sent to the elevator. The room service staff (forgot what your eldest sister’s surname) gave is a small gift. Snacks and children’s wash kits are worthy of praise. The self-service refreshment on the third floor is quite generous, and you can enjoy it at 3-6 pm. The service staff are warm and thoughtful. Therefore, dinner is also ordered on the third floor. Special thanks to Mr. Lai, the Sichuan fellow on the third floor. Warm service (I hope I didn't remember the last name wrong, haha), the price is fairly close to the people, with a 15% discount. The underground parking lot is also free to scrub the car every day. After staying in so many hotels, the Haidilao-style high-quality service has been experienced in Dongshe Hotel, the preferred hotel for business trips in Dongshe!

It can take care of the scenic spots and the physical strength of mom and dad. The complimentary afternoon tea is also very practical. The hotel’s late check-out and unlimited supply of mineral water are very intimate, and Ctrip's high score of 4.8 is well-deserved. Thanks again to Zhao Ya, Zhao Xiao, Xiaohong, Jia Le, Han Yong, Lei Yu and Zhang Yinzhu for taking care of us during our stay. You have worked hard, and hope your hotel will get better and better.

msg:A particularly good hotel with an excellent location, a ten-minute walk from the Bell and Drum Tower, Muslim Street and Ming City Wall. The hotel’s hardware facilities are perfect, not to mention, just talk about the service. There is unlimited supply of bottled water every day. There is a large box of beverages, milk, biscuits and snacks every day. The room service is very meticulous and thoughtful. I praise Cai Qiufang, Xiao Xiao and Wu Lingmin. Wang Jianrong, the washed clothes were dried in the bathroom. When he came back at night, the waiter left a note that the wet clothes had been dried. During breakfast, I chatted with the restaurant manager Guo Jianwei. Manager Guo learned that we had a small group of people going to Mount Huashan, and there was no food prepared. The waiter Yi Gaili, Lu Ani, and Zhang Yinzhu were specially approved to take us in the cafeteria. I took some food with us. We were embarrassed to only take a few breads. The waiter said to take them at the door when we packed them away. When we got them, we found that they also filled us with more milk and yogurt. It was so touching. I have stayed in a lot of five-star hotels, and the hardware is much better than this, but the service Dongshe is definitely ranked first, and I have already recommended it to friends who are going to travel to Xi'an. The pictures on the official website of other hotel facilities are basically the same. I didn’t take photos. I took a few photos of breakfast and afternoon tea for your reference. You can eat many Xi’an snacks in the hotel.

The hotel is not luxurious, it may be related to the room type, but it is very distinctive, the location is also good, and travel is very convenient. A 15-minute walk from the city wall, but also through the bar street, night snack street.
In particular, the hotel service is great. The floor butlers Wang Xiaoyun, Wang Jianrong, and Wu Lingmin are very enthusiastic. Especially Wang Xiaoyun saw that we were bringing children and took the initiative to add toiletries. After knowing my preferences, he took the initiative to change the complimentary drinks from Sprite every day. Coke, put it in the refrigerator. Finally, I would like to thank Manager Zhu. On the last day, we knew that we were on a plane at night, so I specifically applied for an extension of 2 hours to check out, and offered afternoon tea as usual. The daytime in Xi'an is very long, the sun is very sunny, and the rich afternoon tea just looks at the street scene and spends leisure time. This time I went mainly for fun. The hotel time is not long. I will consider a higher-level room type when I go there. It should be even better. Thanks again to the staff of Dongshe.

Speaking of hotel facilities, it has been open for a long time, and the facilities are relatively complete, but there are obvious traces of use. The bathroom shower is broken and has not been repaired.
The room is also small.
The price matches the room, but my expectations are too high.

唯獨贈送的下午茶不怎麼樣，茶點可以再提升一些。

ความสะอาดถือว่าดี แต่ติดที่ว่า ห้องน้ำ และ ห้องอาบน้ำ ทั้งสองห้องเป้นห้องแบบที่ไม่มีกลอนประตู ไม่มีที่แขวนผ้า แต่เน้นการจัดแต่งโซนห้องน้ำให้สวยงามแต่ไม่เน้นความสะดวกในการใช้งานเลย ถ้าคุณไม่ซีเรียสกับเรื่องแบบนี้ ก็ถือว่าห้องน้ำสวยมาก 

โรงแรมมีกลิ่นหอม สบู่แชมพู หอมมาก

msg:和家人來西安旅遊，3天都在這個酒店住。之所以選擇預訂東舍酒店還是因為網上反饋的口碑很好，並且同事推薦了這家。事實也是跟網上説的一樣非常的棒。從這幾天住下來的反饋來看，給了這個酒店很高的評價。 
設施：非常完備，該有的都有，完全符合這個酒店的星級要求。 （最貼心的是有掛漢服的大架子，還有超大落地鏡，方便換裝的妹子們打量整體造型！）
衞生：很好。出門住酒店難免對酒店衞生比較挑剔。這次非但沒有挑出毛病反倒給與很高的評價，非常的好。 
環境：很襯託西安古城的風韻。細節很有特點。 
服務：服務員很熱情並且很細心，前廳李經理很早就聯繫了我們，加了微信，給我們發了非常實用的旅遊攻略，節省了我們很多時間，由於我們訂的房間，和人數比較多，我們專門把李經理拉到了我們羣裏，所有問題都可以直接幫忙解決了，臨走的時候還幫我們介紹了很多西安可以帶走的小吃，真的很方便，這也是很多酒店不容易做到的，但東舍酒店就做到了，給滿分。 
早餐：早餐很豐盛，中式西式都有。肉夾饃和甑糕很好吃。 
停車：酒店有免費停車場，自駕開車來的停車很方便。 
交通：酒店附近就有地鐵站，公共交通出行也很方便。

洗衣房衹有兩個洗衣機一個乾衣機，排隊洗衣到半夜，有點累。

msg:酒店就在馬路邊，但是沒有專屬停車位，所以上下很不方便。在我們到達的時候，面對一個叫東舍的餐廳，連酒店大門在哪都不知道。酒店門口沒有服務員，沒人引導，也沒人幫忙拿行李。
房間衹有一個小窗，採光比較脆弱，沒有冰箱。
樓層服務員態度不錯，劉平很熱情。酒店包車司機鐵師傅也很熱情，服務周到。
酒店LOGO有設計感，挺好看。
酒店位置很方便，附近餐廳很多，後面是一個小區，很安靜。

msg:서안여행 첫 날 가족들 총 7명이 함께 머물렀던 숙소입니다.
최근에 지어져서 그런지 내부나 모든 시설이 매우 깔끔하고 좋았습니다!
특히 서안 중심지에 있는 곳이다 보니 회민거리, 종루, 고루 등 도보로 이동하기도 매우 좋습니다ㅎㅎ
걸어서 한 10~15분 정도 걸리긴 하는데, 저녁먹고 살살 걸어오기 너무 좋은 거리인데다
메인거리에서 살짝 안쪽으로 들어와있어서 밤에도 조용하게 지낼 수 있었습니다.

방은 넓고 깨끗하며, 화장실/샤워실이 분리되어있는 형태라 좋았습니다.
물도 잘 나오고 어매니티도 잘 준비되어 있습니다.
아침도 상당히 괜찮았고, 7명이 갔는데도 다 같이 앉을 수 있는 자리가 있어서 더더욱 만족스러웠습니다.
종업원분들도 다들 매우매우매우매우 친절하시고 어떤 일이든 최선을 다해 도와주시려고 하는게 많이 보였습니다.

다만 체크인 시간에 대한 관리는 조금 필요해보입니다.
14시부터 체크인이라고 해서 점심 먹고 호텔에 갔는데도 거의 두 시간 넘게 방을 기다렸던 것 같아요.
(룸 4개 예약했는데, 도착했을 때는 1개만 준비되어 있었고 3개는 LATE CHECK-OUT 때문에 기다려야 한다는 안내만 받았습니다)
저는 에프터눈 티세트 제공하는 패키지 예매했던지라 호텔 프론트에 짐 맡기고 RECEIPT 받아서 3층에서 티세트 먹으면서 기다렸습니다.
저희야 오후에 별다른 일정이 없어서 크게 상관은 없었지만 오후부터 바로 놀러가셔야 되는 분들은 프론트에 짐 맡기고 가시던지 하셔야 될 수도 있을 것 같습니다.


그래도 아쉬웠던 체크인 시간도 잊을 만큼 만족스럽게 보낸 숙소라 추천드립니다 :)

酒店安排的丁虎接送車隊非常準時，態度很好。
西安值得再來一次，東舍酒店也值得再光顧！

服務從前台到打掃衞生阿姨都很好，一來又是飲料又是各種指引。前台小劉小吳在我餐食券過期後又補了一張，打掃衞生阿姨蔡秋芳武玲敏主動幫我們洗的衣服晾曬到外面，幹了幫我們收回。整體服務確實很不錯哦。
