msg:When I first walked through the doors of this beautiful hotel…I was shocked. It was like walking through heaven! The staff were so helpful in taking my suitcases, bringing them to my room, and helping me check-in smoothly. I was a little hesitant about not being able to have my room ready since I was checking in at 10am but they were so nice in making sure I had a room and they made this happen through upgrading my friend and I to a larger room! Not only did this make the stay even more enjoyable but the breakfast and pool were also amazing! My pool is huge and clean, but you must wear a swimming cap which they can give you at the front desk before you enter the pool! The pool closes at 11pm which is amazing if you’re a late night swimmer! Breakfast, on the second floor, definitely did not disappoint me as they had a great variety of western and Chinese breakfast. From hash browns, to bacon, to pastries, to fruits! You can definitely get full with this breakfast! I will definitely be coming again in the near future!

In a central location so its convenient to get around. But the sevice is not too great. My daughter felt like someone was following her but when she approached the front desk, they didnt seem to care or show any concern. Front desk staff need better training.

The Concierge Manager Jason Zhang and his team  Mr Young Yang, The Guest Managers, Mr Terry Mr Koh, front liners, Rebecca, Evelyn and of course the 2 bell boys too. 
Mr Jason who is English speaking has gone  the extra mile to help give us invaluable advice  for our private local tours.
Thus, Legendale Hotel Beijing is one of the best 5 star hotel that we have stayed in China.

We didn’t eat any other meals in the hotel. One warning to other foreign travellers - credit cards are only accepted at hotels, some shops in major malls, and some major tourist sites. Otherwise it’s cash for things like taxis, local shops. The locals use a ubiquitous payment app linked to mobile phones.

msg:The building is beautiful, and the bedrooms are very comfortable. By and large we slept very well. However, there are annoying, "Ryanair-like" little scams that do not make you feel in a five-stars hotel. We were charged an extra 30 RMB for no reason for the room, an extra 20 RMB for peanuts that we did not order at the bar, 60 RMB for a bottle of water in the room, etc. We were also disturbed unnecessarily at 10 pm in our room (first by a phone call, then by an employee who forced us to answer the phone call), apparently because one employee had refunded us by mistake. I later suggested the manager make a gesture in return, and to this day I'm still waiting.

The staff pretended to speak English but did not and, therefore, could not respond to simple questions or did not follow your requests. But this is negligible and a 5 is definitely the right score for this hotel.

msg:Bonjour Beijing! 

Love the Parisian vibe of this hotel. The aesthetic is so beautiful right from the lobby to the room. It has very comfy bed and pillow so soft you it's all you need after full day of walking.

The swimming pool is simply stunning. You need to wear swim cap to use it and can be purchased at the front desk. It has sauna and jacuzzi at the back.

The breakfast buffet was decent, mostly Chinese with few western dishes. It is located very near to shopping haven Wangfujing street. However, there is no convenience stores nearby so need to walk a little bit.

Didi Taxi only cost USD10 from PEK airport to get here.

The only thing is the wifi seems to be rather slow and my room had a few power trips almost daily. The room service activated the electrician to check on it but after a while, it will trip again on its own. Since we are out during the day and return late in the evening, we just got used to it during the 5 days stay instead of calling for the service staff daily. Other than that, all is well. Had an enjoyable stay in Legendale.

My husband and I got married in Beijing at our Embassy and we chose to stay at The Legendale because we wanted somewhere special to get ready and then enjoy an afternoon tea at. The Legendale did not disappoint. The staff were amazing and from the moment we checked in to the moment we left we felt like royalty. Everyone was so friendly and welcoming and the room was extremely comfortable. The breakfast was adequate but a little more catered to Chinese than what I expected. Other than that we were extremely happy and will definitely recommend to friends and stay again! 😁

It is an old hotel, the hall on entrance to the hotel is very grand and spacious, but is indicative if the age of the hotel. In the room,  some of the equipment is quite dated, the TV and other appliances have all seen better days. But that is okay, thanks to its location you won't be spending too much time in the room using the TV. The walls are cracking and paint is peeling off around some parts of the room, and the carpet had an old burn mark but this is all to be expected from an older hotel, and for the price it was really great value. The bed and pillows were really comfortable and clean, and the bathroom was also well cleaned and taken care of. Overall it is an old, but good hotel and well worth the price.

msg:The exterior and interior of this hotel is simply beautiful. It feels as though you are walking inside a museum in Paris. The decor is a wonderful blend of blues, golds, whites, and diamonds. The service here is exceptional. Ms. Bacaloni in the french restaurant was especially kind and attentive. The rooms have an equally beautiful french vibe with plenty of amenities and high quality products such as L’OccitNe and a huge comfy bed. They also have things that other hotels should consider implementing such as labeling the light switches and a small bench for the shower room. I noticed that the paint on the shower room ceiling is peeling off a little but no big deal. 

The location is excellent too; 5 minute walk from the subway station, 30 minutes away from the south railway station by train, and plenty of restaurants, malls, and attractions around.

The western and Chinese food served in the french restaurant is delicious, however I deeply regretted paying 150 for the Chinese buffet as the food was surprisingly average. 

Overall, if you have the budget, then this place is practically perfect and I will definitely consider staying here again when I get the chance to go to Beijing again.

Environment: French style, magnificent, various Western antiques are displayed everywhere in the hotel, which is ingenious. In addition, the hotel has a small garden, where you can enjoy the cool breeze and the fragrance of roses at night, which is an unexpected surprise of this trip.
Service: Overall, it is okay, but the waiters in the executive lounge need to pay more attention to the needs of customers, such as removing plates and serving coffee, and they can be more proactive.
Executive privileges of the VIP Club: The lounge is not on the 16th floor at present, but on the 2nd floor French restaurant. The environment is very good, and the food for afternoon tea and dinner is standard and satisfactory. I told the front desk about the anniversary, and they also helped to decorate the room, which is very considerate.

First of all, the hotel is in an excellent location, and it is very convenient to go to Wangfujing, Tiananmen Square, the Forbidden City, etc. Many routes around the hotel are very suitable for city walks. The hotel's European-style decoration style is classical and unique, and it is very good to take pictures from any angle, but the most outstanding thing is the hotel's service, whether it is the hotel's check-in, welcoming guests, helping guests transport luggage, or room service, or executive courtesy, the comfort of the French restaurant, the clean dining environment and dining experience, the quick change of tableware, are all very thoughtful, warm and have boundaries. It is indeed a home-like service experience. I hope that the hotel can continue to maintain a sincere service attitude and excellent service quality for a long time. I also wish that the Legendale will do better and better, and I will choose to stay next time.

Fruits are prepared, and there is also a large plate of apples in the corridor near the elevator. Just take them if you need them.
The decoration is a bit old, and the bed is not very comfortable and a bit hard. There are flowers in the room for decoration, a bouquet of roses, very beautiful. It makes the room look fresh. Take a bath at night, there are rose petals in the bathtub in advance, if necessary, you can deal with the bouquet in the room yourself, which is very convenient.

msg:I am very happy to review Beijing Legend Residence Hotel, which ranks third in the luxury hotel rankings. I have to say that the service here does not match the star rating of the hotel. It is extremely poor.
I initially booked a two-bedroom apar**ent, which I admit was very cheap, costing just over two thousand, so no one called me that day to confirm who was staying. But on the same day, we also booked a room at the Ritz-Carlton, which was only 1,000 more expensive than that room. They called us in the morning to ask for information about the guests and our needs, so that they could prepare in advance.
I thought maybe the room booked at Legend was too cheap, and the room I was booking that day was a wedding room, so there would be more additional demand, so I immediately upgraded to the most expensive Legend suite that could be booked on the platform. Not surprisingly, there is no difference at all.
After arriving at the hotel, the hotel's service did not disappoint me at all. Except for the guy who opened the door and the young girl at the front desk, there was no one who would not give you a bad look, talk and ignore you, and ask for a single request. , but I just can’t do it.
When I got off the car, I told the security guard at the door to contact the concierge to move the luggage to the room. I went to check in, but no one took care of it. In the end, my friend went to the concierge to get a courtesy car to move it up. Before I came here, I sent a few boxes to the hotel, and I asked the concierge to help me move them to my room later. I said I would be leaving soon, so I wouldn’t move them up myself. The head concierge put on a stinky face like "I owe him 1.8 million". Without raising his eyes, he told me that he couldn't move things in without a room card. This was the first time I heard that a five-star hotel requires guests to carry luggage into the room. The person accompanying me is still a supervisor.
I needed to book a conference room for the night, so I called room service and asked me to find him on the next floor. He would wait for us in the elevator. We didn't see anyone after we got down, so we thought he was slow to arrive and we waited for a while. It turned out that this guy was chatting with someone in the lobby (which is not the same place as the elevator room). We went over and asked them if they knew about the appoin**ent with the room service depar**ent. After checking whether the person in the room came, he said it was him who made the appoin**ent, "Yes, it's me, what's wrong?"
Yes, as expected, it’s another man with a bad face. I said, didn’t you say that we can see you when we come down to the elevator? We don’t recognize you. How can we find you when you run to the lobby? “I’ll take you to the conference room now.” "Okay?" "..." I really have nothing to say.
Generally speaking, I have a very bad experience about this hotel that day. It is a lightning protection. I will not stay here again in the future. Don't spend money to make trouble.

msg:The last time I stayed at Legend was almost twelve years ago, when my first baby was still in my belly. I went to Beijing to play and stayed at Legend. The service was friendly and the environment was beautiful and unique. This time I brought my three babies to play with my family. I suddenly wanted to stay in this hotel where I had stayed before. Everything was as good as I remembered. The first time the children saw it, they looked like they were mine. Feel better :)
Facilities: Although they are a bit old, they are still beautiful.
Hygiene: very good
Environment: A place where you can check in and take photos.
Service: Very good and very satisfied
Honorable Club executive benefits: The French restaurant has a very good environment and four meals a day. It is suitable for bringing children.
There are two Beijing-style snacks for breakfast. One is a white rectangular one called jujube paste and walnut cake, which is delicious. There is also a square one that seems to have a walnut shape on it. I don’t know what it is called. I also like to eat it. Now I am a little annoyed that I don’t eat more. A few, don’t know where to buy them. Go and stay again if you have the chance.

The hotel is not new, you can see it from the renovation, but it is very well maintained and tidy.
The breakfasts are varied, the watermelons are very tasty, but European food is very difficult to find.

Small nuances: the pool was not open when we arrived (we were warned about this when booking), and the restaurant serving Portuguese cuisine was also not open. And the restaurant with French cuisine is stated to be open until 22.00, but in fact until 21.00.

I have stayed at Legend Hotel before and upgraded to a suite. This time I brought my baby to experience it. I stayed in a double bed room. Compared to other star-rated hotels, the room is not big. The internal settings are not new. It is better than clean.

msg:I stayed in hotels 3 times in total. The first two times I booked them for my parents. This time I came to stay by myself and booked a 2-bedroom apar**ent suite for around 1,800 a night. 1. Breakfast is generally not as rich as in hotels, but overall it’s decent. The two-bedroom suites we ordered only came with 2 breakfasts, which is a bit awkward. 2. I booked a room on Ctrip and paid a few hundred dollars to upgrade the room privately, and the hotel charged I paid a deposit of 1,000, which is not much money, but the way of collecting the deposit made me feel uncomfortable and too deliberate. 3. The room is large, with a living room, kitchen, two toilets and two bedrooms. The bed in the bedroom is also very large and can be lived in 4 personal. 4. The decoration of the room and hotel is very retro and suitable for taking pictures, but the details cannot be seen. It is rough and the usual maintenance and repair may not keep up with the chain brands. 5. There are many waiters in the lobby at the entrance, but they will not take the initiative to ask for needs. 6 . One toilet is very big and one is very small. The large one is very luxuriously decorated, and the small one only has a bath towel. 7. The kitchen has kitchen utensils, refrigerator, etc. 8. The faucet in the bathroom is very old and difficult to turn on. It is either too cold or too hot and you need to adjust it yourself. It can be inconvenient 9. The location is relatively good. It is an 18-minute walk from Wangfujing and about a 40-minute walk from Tiananmen Square. 10. Invoicing I am very annoyed that the front desk does not answer the phone. Overall, the appearance is very good, but the service experience is relatively low. The front desk service experience is poor, which is still different from chain hotels.

It's about half an hour by subway to Beijing South Station. It's an hour and a half to Daxing Airport and about an hour to the capital. The transportation is extremely convenient.

Do you feel that the hotel only maintains the appearance and the interior is not important?

The most speechless thing is - the place where cotton swabs are placed in the bathroom is actually used! ! ! Speechless 
Environment: The room is very hot and dry. Children are prone to getting angry and nosebleeds. You need to pay close attention to those with children (you can tell where you are from on your ID card). Humidifiers may be needed in the south! to strengthen
Service: not considerate enough or detailed enough. Beijing is the heart of China and they all represent the capital of Beijing.
VIP Club Executive Benefits: This is even more speechless. If you are traveling with children, the front desk will not tell you whether children need to be charged and how much it will cost. It doesn’t matter how many meals you eat. It is not delicious and the taste is really speechless...
Anyway, I probably won’t come here again, it’s all because of the praise from internet celebrities.

The breakfast did not happen to me, but another orthopedic customer said that the person in his room had not come yet, but the breakfast coupon was used. The hotel meant that after reporting your room number, it is yours to use, and you have to pay for any extra. If you have a dispute with a customer, isn't it your job to check the room number and check-in customer information? It's obviously due to negligence in the hotel's work

It is also a promise to my mother.
At the beginning of the year, post-impotence syndrome caused my mother to become seriously ill.
At that time, I promised my mother that I would bring her to stay at the Castle Hotel after she recovered. Today I have fulfilled my promise
Bring your parents to Legendale for New Year’s Eve~
This time I booked a business suite with three meals and afternoon tea.
The advantage of the suite is that it has a living room, which is more suitable for two families like ours to spend the New Year together.
Children have a place to play, and the elderly also have a place to sit, drink tea and chat!

Room facilities:
Although it has been open for several years, it is not outdated and can be said to be still magnificent.
parking:
Register your room number and license plate number with the concierge to enjoy a 50% discount on the fare (park in the underground garage)

Room view:
City view! I prefer to see the view in the corridor and inside the hotel! I really like the design of Legend!

Location transportation:
Extremely convenient! Get off at Dengshikou Station on Line 5, exit from Exit C, and walk no more than 500 meters. From the main road, you can recognize Legend Hotel at a glance by its architectural style.

Serve:
Personally, I think it’s great!
Whether it’s the doorman, the front desk, or the room attendant. In my opinion, as long as you are not deliberately looking for trouble, their service is impeccable!

Dining room:
Because of the New Year's Eve, the cafe where we originally ate became a seafood buffet restaurant, 1088 people!
By the way, when I passed by the coffee shop, it was really fresh, the smell of the sea~ The meals included in the room were all eaten in the French restaurant on the second floor! We also accept individual guests, 188 people per person!
Personally, I feel that you can definitely be full! Although there are not many types of dishes, there will always be three or two dishes that you like! It is absolutely no problem to be full!
As long as you recognize the price and are not too picky, you will have a good dining experience.
In my impression, the meals during the Spring Festival and the lunch on the second day are slightly better than the dinner on the first day.
I look forward to mom and dad having a better dining experience on the first lunch of the New Year.
To all the hotel staff and people who read this review, Happy New Year!

But she didn’t reply either. This is a five-star hotel. But I was on the 13th floor of Do Not Disturb and I forgot. When I turned on Do Not Disturb, I thought the switchboard would call me. But the waiter gave me the water with an expressionless face, and then asked me coldly, "What time will I clean your room?" Because I stay in many hotels, other hotels will remind me. Later, I Then I thought about why I forgot to turn on Do Not Disturb. Then I said I would clean it after checking out. I didn’t say much else.
After a late check-out, the hotel front desk manager's service attitude was very good.
I checked out happily humming a song. The third question was that after checking out, I smiled and signaled to the short-haired foreign waitress. I met a waitress in black and she smiled when she saw me around the corner. This didn't make me stop. The problem of happiness is a very big one. She is in sharp contrast to the female staff member who nodded to me just now. She was happy to see me and "smiled", but she didn't say hello and I didn't smile casually. She knew me and maybe "I know you very well, but you're super casual and dismissive." She was super casual and rude because she was the duty manager and walked over. It's simply unreasonable. It's not some ridiculous thing about heterosexual exclusion. I really don't understand it when I come into contact with service situations every day. Why are you laughing again? It's so rude.
The next thing I want to say is the more irritating thing is the manager on duty during the day shift. His name is Weilian or something. It’s almost night. Because I have already checked out of the room. So this is their attitude. It’s almost 6 o’clock and they call me back. I address him as "you". Then the second sentence is "Who among us makes you unhappy?" It's really interesting. Is there anyone in your hotel who makes me unhappy? Can you let me talk about the hotel's problems? Such mindless words are childish. Discourse. This is an attitude problem. This female manager on duty never solves the problem. And always blames the problem on the guests. Now she is even more arrogant. Then when Ctrip communicated with her, her attitude was very poor and dismissive. Ctrip's work The staff replied that she had a bad attitude. This problem happened many times during my stay. She couldn't solve it. She blamed the guest. Then the phone was disconnected. The woman on duty at the hotel said The manager didn't even respond to the call a second time. Now it's a problem of not listening to attitude and never solving it. Solving it... I left in a hurry to catch my flight. Then the female manager on duty had such a bad attitude. I guess she was even better than me. The feedback issues were not taken seriously. Because what I reported to Ctrip at the time was that I would just respond to the manager this time. Because I am also a VIP of Ctrip. The repeat customer came to Ctrip to convey it to her next time. And what I got in exchange was Her arrogant and disdainful attitude. This is how she treats guests. She also doesn't handle or answer. This is not the first time. No one has responded now. She has to use her brain when speaking. Her attitude towards me is so perfunctory.
The female manager on duty who smiled happily and was brought out by the female manager on duty was so casual. She either said hello or smiled kindly. That dismissive smile was really the worst service. And the female manager on duty did not respond. If you don't handle it, you still call me you. Is this how she calls others for the same price? Since you don't take it seriously, don't reply, don't handle it, don't hand it over, and don't take seriously the opinions I asked Ctrip to convey. Then this is a problem with your service attitude. .Not once. Very bad.

Secondly, the concierge of this hotel is also very knowledgeable. He came to greet us from afar, took the initiative to bring the luggage to the room, and also took the initiative to ask if he wanted to store the luggage when checking out. The doorman opened the door in a timely manner. We ran out of water when we checked in on the first day. From the second day on, he helped put two more bottles of water in every day. Unlike some advertised five-star hotels, the concierge is just like wood. Third, many places in the corners of the room can be clearly seen due to the long time. They're all a little cracked. . Fourth, the first time I called to ask for help delivering some ice, the room service operator took a long time to answer the phone. The second time I wanted to ask if I could help postpone check-out until the afternoon. The guest room connection was answered instantly, but they said it couldn't be processed and was transferred to the front desk. As a result, no one answered the phone at the front desk, so I was transferred back to the guest room connection and was asked to call again later. The response efficiency of guest rooms feels low.

The corridor of the hotel is much warmer than the room. Although it is equipped with oil tin, it hardly works. In addition, it is the coldest few days in Beijing. I am shaking when I go to the toilet in the morning. It's no exaggeration. The sanitation is good, but the facilities are not that good. They have not been renovated since they were placed here and are very old. However, given the location and the level of the hotel, the price is generally acceptable.

msg:The appearance of the hotel is nothing to say, it's beautiful and grand, but it feels a lot better when you actually live in it. First of all, let me talk about the good things. The good thing is that it has free three meals a day. Although the food and taste are average, it is better than free.
     Second, let’s talk about the service. The service here is really not up to par with the level of the hotel. You have to take your luggage when you get off the bus. The doorman sits there without even raising his eyelids, let alone saying hello and taking the luggage. However, the Italian service guy was very qualified and polite, and his Mandarin was very good. He took us to the front desk politely, and no one answered us the whole time;
     Third, let’s talk about the room service. The price of the room is so high, but the temperature cannot be adjusted. It was extremely hot all the time. I almost had a heat stroke after entering. It was so hot that I couldn’t sleep or stay, so I had to go out and wander around. In addition, there were only a few bottles of water in the room. and coffee, everything else costs money, a small can of Coke is 30 yuan, which feels not worth the money; the toilet is old and there is no computer toilet; there is no robot delivery service, and you have to go to the first floor to find takeaway.
       Anyway, I think the experience of the hotel is that the service and appearance are out of touch, and I don't want to stay there a second time.

Hotel facilities: The facilities can be seen to be a bit old, but they are well maintained. It can be seen that the hotel was very careful when it opened. The room is very large, the bathroom shower has a large flow of water and the water temperature is right, which is very good. The hand soap and toiletries are from L'Occitane, which is highly praised. In particular, the room has sockets in every place where power may be needed, which can accommodate different power sources. It is currently the most convenient hotel for charging.
Hygiene: The hotel room is very clean and there are basically no dead spots. It would be better if an alcohol tablet is prepared for the toilet to wipe.
Service: The hotel service is also very good. When I called the service phone, I was connected quickly. I was so thirsty that day that I ordered a fruit plate and freshly squeezed juice, which were all fresh.
Breakfast: The breakfast restaurant is not very big, but every meal tastes good and the ingredients are very fresh.
Overall, I am very satisfied with my stay

Parking on the ground is 16/hour, and we were told that the ba*****t is 10 and there is a discount. We believed it. Who knew that it was like walking through a maze with nine twists and turns, the signboards were not clear, and I got off the wrong bus several times and got on again to continue looking. The experience was super bad.
But the room was ok, the TV was a bit old and the humidifier wouldn't turn on. How can I put it, it looks very high-end, but the quality still needs to be improved, otherwise it will not be five stars.

Privilege Club Simple Dinner for Two: The dinner was given to fellow travelers. It is said that the reviews were average. The fried pork chop appeared in the French restaurant and was criticized for a long time😅 Maybe the hotel only ate in this restaurant and it was not French food. It is recommended to clearly select the menu next time, otherwise it will not be a good idea to cause misunderstandings.

Privilege Club Simple Lunch for Two: My friend and I had lunch together, and it felt very good. It's a buffet, and even though it's a buffet, every dish tastes pretty good, and the variety is surprising, including pizza, cheese platters, homemade pasta, etc., which exceeds expectations.

It is very popular on Jinbao Street, and it is surrounded by luxury car sellers. The interior decoration is elegant (Picture 3 is a downward shot of the interior of the hotel, and Picture 2 is the shape of the room). Even the swimming pool has a palace feel. It may be because oil paintings are used more, plus European decoration style. The location is good and convenient to go anywhere. The buffet is good, even the small furnishings at the door are very good (see picture 1), the children had a lot of fun

The double bed I stayed in has to be praised: the bed is larger than the average hotel and the toiletries L'Occitane. Things that need to be improved: the breakfast is not good. How about it? There are few varieties of Chinese food, the taste is average, the service in the restaurant is very poor, and there are very few seats. I finally waited until the last one was finished and left, and asked the waiter to come and clean up. The waiter asked us to find another place, and also asked for a deposit. When checking in, some of the services provided with the room were not clearly introduced, which was a waste and made people feel that it was not worth it.

I like the decoration of the room very much, it is exquisite and elegant. The Chris**as decorations downstairs are very a**ospheric. It's just that I arrived too late that day and couldn't take a good look at other parts of the hotel. It would be nice if there were instructions for common items in garbage classification. There are many items that I don’t know which one they belong to. The wardrobe has a bit of a weird smell, but everything else is okay.

msg:I have to give your hotel a good review. Although the public areas of the old brand hotel look quite luxurious, the overall situation is a bit like a copy of the ** hotel in Macau. I thought it was the beginning of a pleasant journey, but the negative reviews started from the door. The waiter was a short old man who took a taxi. Everyone came to help with their luggage. We were not familiar with the people who got off the bus across the street and were ignored. Isn't it amazing to take a taxi at the door? Our family is full of luxury cars. When we saw him again, we were waiting for the car at the door, but he directly drove us out of the way. It was very rude. I went to the front desk and asked for a deposit of 1,000. Please, many hotels now don’t require a deposit. Let’s make a counter-offer of 500. The front desk said yes, and then immediately called the customer service to take away the consumer goods. See the picture. Don’t drink this rubbish drink given to me. , you are so distrustful of customers, why don’t you take away a flower plate made in the Qianlong period at home! This one seems to be more valuable, right? It's not very harmful, but it's very insulting. I really want to scold you. I've stayed in many hotels several times higher than yours, but I've never seen anything like you. Let's talk about the room. It's dilapidated, with cracked paint on the walls, dirty carpets, and dirty toilets. There is not even a disinfectant towel, but at least there is a disposable cover. The bath water is not comfortable at all. The bed is the worst I have slept on in the three days since I came to Beijing. I didn’t sleep well for one night, and any old bed will be soft. I didn't change the pillow when it was collapsed. I woke up in the morning with soreness in my back and a stiff neck. It was not worthy of this hotel standard. The most annoying thing is that the deposit was not refunded until I reviewed it at 2:30 pm! Garbage hotel!

Let’s talk about check-in first. Because I didn’t bring my ID card, I needed to go to the police station so that I could discuss it with my family. But I didn’t want to bother my children, so I asked my children if they could not go. The waiter asked, don’t you want to go too? What’s there to worry about? . Instantly popular⋯
After entering the room, the light switch was bent, and there were no children's bathrobes. It felt like it was in disrepair everywhere, the walls were cracked, and the handle that shook the curtains broke at the touch. The most important thing was to turn it off before going to bed. Turned off all the lights and nothing happened.
Let’s talk about breakfast. We booked breakfast at the French restaurant, and we were also full of expectations. However, the variety and quality were not even as good as Atour’s all season! It really sucks!
Friends, don’t stay in this hotel! Want service but not service, want quality but not quality! It’s really not as good as Atour, All Seasons

Lunch is average, dinner is better and there is wine. Whether you drink it or not is one thing. At least there is it. Just like the dishes, it’s my business to eat it or not. At least you have to look at it and feel comfortable.

All the accessories in the bathroom are sparkling and of high quality. The service is a standard five-star level. It is hidden where you can't see it, but you can feel the attentiveness and considerateness everywhere, very old money style.

We were a bit worried about continental breakfasts, but without much effort everyone will find something for themselves.
One tiny minus - one day a young couple was getting ready for their wedding on the first floor - the guests were smoking heavily while waiting in the upstairs corridor, although it is strictly forbidden in the hotel. The entire floor was filled with smoke - including our room after we walked in and opened the door. However, I do not deduct any star for this, because it was more the fault of the lack of culture of the people than of the hotel itself and the staff.

The hotel doorman will take the initiative to help carry luggage to the room, and when leaving the hotel, a young lady will come to ask for hotel advice.
Overall, I felt the warm service of the staff during my stay. The room was clean and tidy. The location of the hotel is also very good. There are shared bicycles at the door that can be used to ride to the vicinity of the Forbidden City.
A small suggestion, you can tell which hot and cold water switch valve is in the shower area.

I will choose here again next time I come to Beijing

Because I wanted to watch the Tiananmen flag-raising ceremony on National Day, I went to the Legend Hotel closest to Wangfujing Street. As soon as I arrived, I was attracted by its European city-style appearance and stayed in a business suite. The overall feeling of the four days and three nights was okay. Of course, there were two minor problems. I am very grateful to Manager Shi of the Guest Service Depar**ent of the hotel for solving them properly. It is worthy of praise that Director Zhao of the Guest Relations Depar**ent took the initiative to greet and ask for his opinions on the hotel. I would like to suggest that the service attitude of several waiters in the French breakfast restaurant is very good and lively. In particular, a fat (sorry) waitress has a better service attitude. Thank you very much.

msg:I originally lived in the Regent opposite, but traveling with my parents to get an extra bed was a nigh**are. No matter how good the hotel is, I decided to move to a two-bedroom suite. It was the right decision. Here are a few tips:
1. The suite is really great. Although the facilities are old, the space is excellent, and the dynamic and quiet areas are divided. The old-school European decoration is different from the business hotel style, giving people a special home feeling, friendly and comfortable. (My house also has wainscoting.
2. The scenic spot is downstairs. When parents get up early, they can go for a walk downstairs first, have breakfast, then go upstairs for a lunch break at noon, and then go out after resting. Simply a perfect experience.
3. The bedroom has good lighting and area, and the living room is so comfortable. No matter how good the five-star standard room is, it cannot be compared.
4. The facilities are indeed old. After all, it was a high-end hotel 15 years ago.
5. The service cannot be said to be particularly good, mainly compared with the service at Regent the night before. There is still a gap. For example, when picking up luggage at the entrance, the smiling service is a bit poor. In the lobby, there are fewer people than Regent. It's all in the subtleties, but the impression is obvious.

Summary: The experience of the two-bedroom suite covers all flaws. I will come again next time I bring my parents! It is recommended that anyone traveling with three or more people try it!

Call in advance to understand our personal preferences and have a better impression before arriving at the hotel.
Because I arrived late in the evening due to my schedule that day, the service staff at the front desk upgraded me to a suite.
After a tiring day, I slept well. The pillow is so comfortable and deserves a thumbs up~

msg:The location is good. It's not the first time I've stayed there, but something happened this time that brought a very bad experience. I won't come back again. A friend came to visit and I took him to the room. The hotel front desk called and said he needed to register. We are in the process. We were talking about something, so I replied that I would come down later to do the operation. The other party said in a very impatient tone that he had been waiting for ten minutes after calling me just now to urge me to go down immediately. I replied that he had not called my room just now. Did you remember it wrong? The other party didn't inquire, but kept asking when he was coming down, with an aggressive tone. I understand your work, but please respect me. When I checked out, I heard who it was. After thinking about it, I decided not to expose it. I have stayed in many places. Big hotel, this is the first time I have encountered this situation. The hotel should check and improve itself. Anyway, I will not come again.

On the first night, I was assigned a strange room type with two windows facing other rooms. Are there not so many normal rooms in such a big hotel? What is the service strategy of leaving good room types vacant? It was said around 4pm that there was no room available, but at 5pm it was available again? Do you want to entertain guests during this time? The next day I moved to a normal room and found that there was no floor heating in the bathroom. I asked on the phone and said that the entire building did not have floor heating. However, the room on the first night obviously had floor heating, so the first night How special is the room, so special that its functionality is also the most secretive thing in the entire hotel?

1. I like the classical European decoration style of the hotel.
2. When having breakfast in 2017, the coffee was placed in a stainless steel bucket, just like a soy milk bucket. This time I changed the coffee machine, praise.
But what about that milk carton connected to the coffee machine with a plastic tube? How ugly!
3. The waiter was very enthusiastic. I asked for an extra quilt and a few bottles of water and brought them over quickly.
4. Seeing that we have an elderly person, the front desk took the initiative to upgrade the room. Thank you very much.
shortcoming:
1. The toilet seat in the room does not rebound slowly, and the sound of it falling is scary. You have to be mentally prepared. It is recommended to replace the toilet seat.
2. The food and drinks that require payment in the room are not clearly marked, making it easy to consume them without knowing it.
3. The toothbrushes are of the same color, making it difficult to distinguish whose toothbrush is whose.

But why is the executive lounge so bad?
Can anyone tell me if the straws in your French restaurant are expensive?
Every time I ask for a straw, I get slapped with shame.
Speechless
I won’t say whether the food is delicious or not. Everyone has their own opinion.
Let’s talk about restaurant service
My wife doesn’t think it tastes good and wants a little soy sauce.
A group of waiters were laughing and laughing behind me. I just came out of the bathroom and heard them talking about the customers.
Asking for a plate of condiments is a very reasonable request, but your employees are actually laughing at the customers behind their backs? How to train. The quality is really poor.

The happiest thing about living in the city is that you can order takeaway. I have ordered several times, watermelon, ice and snow honey city, KFC, but you need to go downstairs to pick it up. In terms of service, I don’t really feel that there is any service, and the chef in the breakfast depar**ent is so aggressive, he likes to answer and ignores, and what he says is choking. In general, the room is really big and comfortable to live in, but the service is a bad review.

The transportation is very convenient, just walk through the intersection after getting off the subway station. The hotel is very beautiful and meets the five-star standard. The front desk service was very enthusiastic and offered to upgrade us to a 1.5-meter twin room. The room is more spacious and comfortable than expected, the bed is neither soft nor hard, very good sleep. The bathroom is super big, and the toiletries are L'Occitane, I like it very much. Four bottles of mineral water are provided every day, just in time for the scorching heat in Beijing, enough to drink when going out to scenic spots. Although there are not too many varieties of breakfast, it tastes very good. The waiter can also receive the plate after the meal in time to keep the table clean. Legendale provided us with a comfortable resting place for our tired bodies after visiting the scenic spots. Our family members were very satisfied, and my husband was full of praise. Next time I come to Beijing, I will choose Legendary.

But I don’t know why the opening of the hotel lobby to the public this year resulted in an overall chaos in the lobby and lounge area. All of them were taken by various social workers and took selfies. Is it to show the hotel’s humanistic care? Except for the complimentary dinner and lunch, the overall price/performance ratio is really not high! It is recommended that the management of special holidays should be slightly more guest-oriented in the future.

It only takes less than 10 minutes to get to Wangfujing downtown area.
(There are Four Seasons Minfu and Xiaodiaoli Soup nearby) There are many depar**ent stores and it’s easy to go shopping.
It only takes 30 minutes to walk to the Donghua Gate of the Forbidden City.

Three bedrooms and two living rooms are at this location
Nothing to find fault with

Suggestion: The kitchen should be provided with a rag and vegetable cloth for easy organization
(We still buy it ourselves)

In particular, the suites are not only reasonably priced, but also include three meals a day, and desserts in the afternoon. They are delicious every day and include all kinds of tastes from all over the world. You don’t need to go out to find food or order takeaways. For those who come to Beijing for business Saved a lot of time and money! I will continue to choose Legend next time, and I would like to thank all the service staff for their hard work!

The bed was soft, the door would ring, the curtains did not block light, the faucet was rusty, and the bathroom curtain felt like it was about to break when it was turned by hand. The curtain was dark and dirty.

Environment: The environment does not feel like the environment

Service: Let’s talk about check-in first. There was no queue of people and it was a mess. There were more breakfast supervisors than staff. The chef in the freshly prepared area looked indifferent. The handkerchiefs in the room said there were only 20 on one floor and no more could be given. The room cleaners were pretty good.

The overall feeling is very bad. It is not friendly to children and does not have any expectations. It is very bad. I have never given a negative review. I don’t know how this high rating came. It is really very bad. It is also expensive. I paid a high price to stay in a hotel with very poor facilities. I really didn’t want to stay for one night because I was not afraid of trouble with my children. During the whole 4 days, I didn’t take the initiative to say hello or anything. I really regret staying in this hotel.

Calling the customer service did not solve the problem. Instead, we were told that there was no air conditioner in the hotel after 6 o'clock and the attitude was very perfunctory, which made us sleepless all night. , this should not be the attitude of a star hotel. The next day the hotel staff told us that the air conditioner was turned on 24 hours a day. Looking for duty manager? We didn't come to the hotel to quarrel. The staff really should be trained, but fortunately, the manager finally solved the problem for us and changed to a room with no problem with the air conditioner.
The overall style of the hotel is nice and suitable for taking pictures. The environment is very good. It is very close to some famous attractions. The sanitation is OK and the service…

msg:Customer habits of more than ten years can really harm people! After the epidemic, every time I come here, there will be varying degrees of unfair treatment. I have tolerated it until now. This time, I am completely heartbroken. This month, I mainly came for major mouth surgery. I didn’t expect that no one would help me carry my luggage when I returned to the hotel on the first day after being discharged (anyway) It’s been the norm over the years and I’m used to it.) But I didn’t expect that when I was handed my luggage by the concierge after checking in, I would be yelled at twice by an old man! I couldn't speak at first because I had surgery on my mouth, but when I was leading the whole process up the stairs, I kept talking louder and louder. He asked me which hotel my room was in and he was more familiar with me than me. I was wearing a mask and couldn't speak, so he forced me to talk louder and louder. I emphasized that after staying for a few days, I discovered that this was not the case for other customers. It turned out that they only gave me a cold look and loudly questioned me, asking for an apology. The lobby manager agreed and let it go (this happened when I checked into the hotel). Another incident happened when I checked out. The scarier thing was that when I called the front desk in the morning and said that it was less than 5 minutes after check-out, and I was already opening the door, the customer service cleaning lady on the 17th floor loudly said at the door that I hadn't checked out yet, but I was just picking up the bag at the time. I was walking out with my luggage. At this time, this aunt blocked the door and refused to let me go out. Because I was in a hurry to catch the high-speed train, I squeezed out with half of the door blocked. At this time, I had to go downstairs and go to the front desk to check out. This is a hotel. ! Why do they all look like **? Are you devils? After the epidemic, I came here almost every month to bully honest people? Or are you looking down on me because I’m not dressed well? Today I left the hotel in the car and communicated repeatedly with ***, the lobby manager, but nine times during the communication I asked questions that were inappropriate. Is this your attitude towards me? ! I am a patient with severe depression. I am very weak after a major surgery. I was also humiliated by the doorman, the concierge, and the aunt on the 17th floor of a low hotel! What a big bully! Or maybe it’s just watching someone order the dishes! I don’t want to say much else. I won’t suffer in vain. I will definitely give feedback to the relevant departments and fight for my rights as a ten-year-old customer! !

The room area is more than 70 square meters, the bed is very spacious, and the pillows are one high and one low. Friends with different preferences can choose according to their needs. The first round of carbonated drinks in the mini bar is also free. I especially like the hotel's lunch and dinner. The pasta is very good. Authentic, the taste of the desserts can be improved appropriately, and the service of the hotel is also very good. We learned that we took the children to play a treasure hunt, and if we couldn’t find out how to get to the -1 floor, we would carefully guide them. Although the hotel has been around for many years, it still has its own characteristics. like very much.

There is a small shortcoming. I personally don’t like L’Occitane’s shampoo products, especially the conditioner. After using it, my hair is frizzy. The same is true for L’Occitane in other hotels. I can give feedback to the manufacturer for improvement😄

msg:City Vacation 🏰The most resort-like Legendary Hotel in Beijing
Last week, I had dinner with a girlfriend who had just returned from a business trip in Paris. The topic always revolved around the familiar French streets and food and wine. Feeling itchy for a while, I decisively booked the Legendale Hotel to give my soul a temporary vacation and take a trip to France, which is also a reward for myself before the Goddess Festival.

Why Choose Legendale Hotel Travel France? Although this hotel is located in the hinterland of Wangfujing, the core area of the capital, it has a gorgeous European-style building from head to toe. It is definitely a hotel with the strongest sense of vacation.

This is the second stay. Entering the lobby, looking at the super high hollow patio like a space-time tunnel, the surprise when I first saw it was replaced by the peace of mind when I saw an old friend. Compared with the period of yq, the flow of people staying here has indeed picked up significantly, everywhere is thriving, and I can't help but feel relieved.

This time I still stayed in the executive suite on the 16th floor, and it was still a set meal including four meals a day. The super high cost performance made people want to stop. It coincided with my family's birthday, and the hotel even made birthday decorations thoughtfully, which was really surprising!

The executive suite with super large space has the best view of Wangfujing. The bedroom enjoys the beautiful view of Jinbao Street. The living room is surrounded by Wangfujing. Moisturizing the outside creates a good mood; the design that can be opened for ventilation is my favorite, and the small terrace with iron railings outside the window has an authentic French style. The Jinbao Street in the sunset and the beautiful view of the CBD in the distance are also soft and romantic.

The four-meal stay package is all in the Bicui French restaurant in the hotel. Now it has returned to the buffet, the food is very good, and the drinks are unlimited. Once again, we are amazed by its super high cost performance! In such a standard French classical a**osphere, with the view of the city east of the Forbidden City outside the window, I am in a good mood!

For our family's birthday party, we didn't eat out, so we chose Haojiangxuan restaurant in the hotel. This is a restaurant that my family and I love very much. Haojiangxuan, which specializes in Huaiyang cuisine and Cantonese cuisine, has a baroque style and splendid dome design, which coincides with the Zhuangzheng of Chinese cuisine.

This time, it is also because Zhao Renliang, a veteran registered Chinese culinary master and state banquet master, is sitting here in person. This time, I am lucky to be able to taste hand-made fish ball soup, green mustard prawn balls, Hong Kong-style roast goose, etc. from Master Zhao.

Facilities: One of the most serious problems is water quality! The water quality is really bad! Where is the tap water and bath water? ! After washing my hands, I feel that my hands are particularly astringent and sticky, as if they have not been washed, which is too scary. This is the first time I have encountered it since I have stayed in so many hotels! Never before! The other facilities are also old and terribly old. The faucets are all rusty and mottled, and the shower heads are all dirty and full of scale. They are never cleaned or replaced, right? There are many moldy spots on the wall tiles, and the ceiling is all faded black when lying on the bed. Not to mention the comfort of the bedding, there are many holes in the sheets, and the quilt covers are all unthreaded, that is, the quilt core can be taken out. This is a huge hole, which covers the end of my neck. The bedding is How can it be so old and not replaced with a new one? The TV is so old that it can produce snowflakes. I can’t find the model of this TV. It’s too old... The price of this store is not cheap, but the facilities are like this...
Sanitation: The hotel sanitation is okay
Service: The service is not bad, but the check-in to the room must be after two o'clock, which is really annoying. Moreover, there are very few counters for registration, and there are few service personnel. It took a long time to queue up. They said that there was no room to wait for cleaning, and the cleaning took two hours abruptly. But the room service for cleaning the room every day is still very good. A new set of everything is given. If I want some mineral water, I give you four or five bottles at once. Thank you very much!

msg:The hotel was opened in 2008. It has been 15 years so far, and I can still feel that the quality of the hotel decoration is excellent, the hardware facilities are not bad, and the decoration style is French style. The hotel is very close to Wangfujing Pedestrian Street, you can go for a walk, and it is also very close to the Forbidden City. The disadvantages are: the mattress in the room is too soft, and my back hurts when I sleep; when checking in, the front desk of the hotel is obviously understaffed, and the guests wait for too long, and the check-in area is too small and crowded; the service of the front desk staff is not enthusiastic, not five-star The service quality of a first-class hotel, is it because the trea**ent given to employees by the hotel is too low?

The room next to it was rented to someone else for a wedding, and seven or eight people started making noises before dawn. You know you shouldn’t rent the room next door to someone else for a wedding. guest. There was no storage basket, and I was asked to put the used bath towels in the bathtub. I don't know if other guests threw them on the floor and whether they would be disinfected. It took me a long time to change rooms, but before I left, I was told to give me shower gel and shampoo in the bathroom as compensation. I'm really drunk. The room rate for a five-star hotel is over a thousand dollars. What kind of five-star hotel is this?

msg:I have always liked European-style architecture. I wanted to find a beautiful hotel to take pictures on my birthday, so I chose Legend without hesitation. As soon as you enter the hotel, you will feel very shocked, and the hollow design has a strong visual impact. The clocks, vases and mirrors in the hotel lobby are all antiques. The hotel is older but still beautiful. The business suite includes a bedroom and a triangular hall. The layout is European-style, and I like it very much.
The hotel is indeed old, and its various facilities are incomparable with new five-star hotels. The golden decoration on the roof has been peeled off. The design of the bathroom is not good. The door of the shower room is not covered by frosted glass. Some people can't use the sink in the bathroom when taking a shower, otherwise they can see everything in the mirror. The shower room is very small. The water is also adjusted by yourself from the hot water on the left and the cold water on the right. If you want to temporarily turn off the hair conditioner or shower gel in the middle, you need to re-adjust it when you turn it on again.
The biggest advantage of this hotel is that the photos are very good, whether it is taken on the corner stairs from the first floor to the second floor, or in the restaurant on the second floor, on the terrace, or in the corridor outside the room.
The reserved business suite includes breakfast, lunch, dinner and afternoon tea for two people. I was a little happy when I made the reservation, and felt that the meal was completely resolved. It was only when I was eating that I realized that the meal was really bad. Afternoon tea is served by portion, and there are very few options. The dinner was even worse, but the roast goose was still edible. The breakfast is a little better, but it is only at the Samsung level. For lunch, only beef cheeks are delicious, tender, and nothing else. So if you book a room that includes meals, and you don’t have any requirements for food, you can eat it. If you need to pay for it yourself, don’t consider the hotel’s meals. The three meals are not worth more than 100.
Parking: You need to park B3 for hotel accommodation to have a discount, about 90 per day

I rode a shared bicycle to pick up the bag I left at the concierge. The whole process didn't take more than two minutes. I looked impatient and immediately asked the security guard to chase me away. I'm not a beggar, right? Hotel managers look down on cyclists so much? Do people who come to your hotel have to drive? The manager clasped his hands in front of his chest and asked the security guard to take it away. Aren't you making things difficult for the security guard?
Is it great to work as a manager in a hotel? What's up? Aren't you here to fight for wages? Who do you look down on? I'm here to spend money, I don't owe you anything. You don't need to treat them differently.

Because there were so many people during the National Day, I contracted a virus and caught a cold, and my whole body was sore and weak. I was supposed to check out at 12 o'clock, but my high-speed train was at night. After applying to the hotel manager, the hotel front desk extended my stay to four o'clock for free, which was no less than a moment of help in times of need. . A hotel with warmth is vital. I will definitely stay at Legend Hotel next time I come to Beijing. Thank you all for taking care of me.

This time I took my parents and children and chose a room with two bedrooms, two bathrooms, one living room and a kitchen. It is French palace style and the decoration is very exquisite. The swimming pool and gym are also very good and open very long, which is suitable for people like me who like to run in the morning and at night. It's a pity because of the decoration style of the room. The charging plugs are all European style. Only the living room has a personal power *****. I hope to prepare more conversion plugs in the future. It's a pity that I only got two nights this time, and I won't be able to get it since the long holiday. I will continue to choose Legend when visiting Beijing in the future.

msg:The Regal Hotel opened in the year of the 2008 Olympic Games. I heard that Bush Sr. and George W. Bush Jr. went to Beijing to attend the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games, and they were the first to stay at the Regal Hotel. My husband and I often go shopping in Wangfujing, and we always pass by here. My husband has always wanted to stay here once. During the epidemic, when we encountered holidays, we always looked for some hotels in the city to stay and rest. This time, I checked in to experience before the children started school. I booked a 3-day and 2-night Premier Club twin room, and the overall feeling is very good. The gentleman said that he will come again in the future!
After deciding to stay, I checked the reviews of Legendary Hotel on the Internet. According to my own experience, the overall feeling is as follows:
1. The location of the hotel is very good! Located in Wangfujing business district, not in the core area, close and not chaotic. Walk for about 5 minutes, you can go to Wangfujing Pedestrian Street, you can visit apm, Xindong'an, depar**ent stores, Wangfu Central, and strolled to Chang'an Avenue on the first night. On the second day of staying here, I walked around the hotel and walked to the Prime Minister's National Affairs Office (the former site), which was the office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs after liberation in 1966, the former residence of Cai Yuanpei (Li Jiacai)! Across the road is Xiehe Hospital... This is an area where cultural relics gather, and you can take a stroll in the future.
2. The interior decoration of the hotel is very a**ospheric. After moving in, I found that someone was taking pictures here. We were taking pictures before dinner, and we hadn't finished taking pictures after dinner. The key is to change clothes and take pictures here. It can be seen that the decoration here is decorated towards "magnificence", which arouses others' interest in making a set of "blockbuster movies"! On the first floor there are antique fireplaces, antique vases, antique mirrors and clocks. The main tone of decoration here is golden yellow and marble, and there are many mirrors, so it has a "magnificent" feeling. The floor spacing is very large, and the room is also very spacious. It is very friendly to my father and son who are over 1.9 meters tall.
3. The hotel has complete facilities. There is only one row of guest rooms on each floor here, and because the middle is hollow, it looks even taller. The best thing about a row of rooms is that it is not noisy in the morning, unlike many hotels, which have aisles on the first floor and two rows of rooms, it is easy to be woken up in the morning. There is a lot of space in the room. In the room I stayed in, the two beds are 1.5 meters wide, almost catching up with the double bed! Although I read the reviews in advance, it said that the facilities in the room are outdated; the TV is relatively old, and there are few channels that can be changed; , National Geographic Channel, CCTV, Satellite TV, etc. are enough. I analyzed the reason for the cracks. The reason for the cracks is that the room is too hot. Beijing itself is relatively dry, and the temperature inside the house is relatively high in winter. The set temperature does not work, and it is always 26 degrees. I don't know if this is the reason. In addition to free mineral water, the premium room also has free drinks, and you can drink more water when the room is hot.
Fourth, the service attitude is very good. Many of the comments I saw before checking in affirmed the service attitude of the service staff. I also felt it when I checked in on the first day. When I checked in on the first day, the lady at the front desk said that there is no clean room yet, first help me to occupy a room with a bigger bed, and patiently explain the parking precautions to me, hotel guests park at B3, you can Go to the concierge to get a 50% off parking coupon. Write the check-in and check-out time on it, and it can be used repeatedly during the stay. In addition, I found that the hotel management attaches great importance to the opinions and suggestions of the guests, and has given feedback to the comments of the guests, not only in the comments on the Internet, but also in the actual work. A guest left a message and found that the curtains were transparent, and was woken up by the bright light in the morning. When I moved in this time, I found that a blackout curtain was added to the curtain box. Don't underestimate this one, it really blocks the light. Some residents reported that the courier boxes at the entrance on the first floor were left untidy, and they reported to the service staff at the entrance that they were harassed. This time, I discovered that a space was specially set up for express delivery, with two doors to separate the inside and the outside, and it can also serve takeaways to avoid random damage to the landscape. These are just what I have seen, and I believe that the hotel management will seriously consider the opinions and suggestions of hotel guests. Therefore, I also offer some small suggestions for reference.
5. Suggestions
1. The executive lounge will be restored soon! My family lives in a hotel now, and usually chooses an executive room, just for the trea**ent of the executive lounge. Even though lunch and dinner are simple meals, I still like the quiet environment of the executive lounge, where I like to rest, read books, watch the scenery, and be in a daze.
2. The temperature of the hot water can be lowered. Some hotel guests reported that the bath water is not easy to adjust! I also found this problem. It is recommended that hot water can lower the temperature. It is best to burn until the body temperature is between 39-45 degrees, so that there is no need to add cold water. Otherwise, the hot water is too hot, and the cold water is not well controlled, which will waste resources. Because, after finally adjusting the temperature, I don’t want to turn off the water. Many hotels have one regulator, and the Regal Hotel still has two switches to control the water temperature. I think the most convenient way is to keep the temperature from getting too high.
3. The indoor temperature can be adjusted by itself. Staying in the store for the past few days, I found that it was adjusted to 23 degrees, but it kept showing that the temperature in the house was 26 degrees. I didn't call for consultation, and felt that such a trivial matter would not bother the service staff. Maybe the room I stayed in had a broken thermostat? I didn't pay attention at the time, but I found that the room was too dry. After taking a bath at night, the ground was completely dry the next morning, and there was no trace of watermark at all. Because it was snowing outside, I didn't dare to turn off the heater at night. How to solve the dryness in the house, I haven't thought about it, I hope it can be solved too!
In short, the overall feeling is very good, suitable for family travel and living.

Environment: It's actually very quiet! I live in the northeast corner of the 13th floor. It's too dry to turn on the heating. I sleep with the window open. The noise is very quiet until 10 am, and I sleep peacefully!
Facilities: Old is old, but the specifications are indeed five-star, and the flaws are not concealed. There are a few things to note though. This hotel should have been designed to receive foreign guests at the beginning, and it still has European standard sockets, but there are enough converters, which are enough. The vanity mirror is very high and cannot be turned down. If it is lower than 1.7, go to the wardrobe mirror. The toilet...is very big, and the butt is relatively small. It's embarrassing 😅 (girls should all...) The hot water takes 3-5 minutes to heat up, so let's put it slowly.
No problem, highly recommended!

This time I did not feel that way during my stay. Although it is not a brand new hotel, it is not old. The central air-conditioning is very convenient and the bathroom is large and sufficient. The service at the front desk was also ok because we had to go shopping in the morning. They helped us delay check-out until two o'clock. The design of the hotel lobby is very beautiful and the European style is suitable for checking in and taking pictures.

There is a special person in the lobby to guide the check-in, and the front desk service is polite and thoughtful, and fully considers the guests. Because I booked the hotel's special items and suites for my birthday, the afternoon tea time was about to expire when I arrived at the store, but the front desk immediately contacted the catering depar**ent to reserve a set of afternoon tea. The European-style room is clean and hygienic. What is surprising is that the hotel prepared flowers, cakes, red wine, and happy birthday lights. The only fly in the oin**ent is that the food does not have the specifications that a five-star hotel should have. It is relatively simple and tastes average. If this point can be improved, it will be invincible.

The deposit paid by Ctrip was not recognized by the front desk and the deposit needed to be repaid. The deposit for the room fee of more than 10,000 yuan totaled 30,000 yuan. Ground parking is inconvenient and expensive. The doorman has a poor service attitude and does not provide door opening service. The overall facilities are old, such as the air conditioner is not cool and the bathroom does not have a smart toilet. If you are used to living in five-star hotels, you will experience it.

But the price is indeed not cost-effective and the decoration style is quite outdated. It’s like a rich man who suddenly became rich but his aesthetics has not kept up.
The room had a very strong musty smell that couldn't be dissipated at all.
The socket design is unreasonable and there are too few. I have to get out of bed to charge before going to bed at night.
The hair dryer was broken. I called for a long time and got a replacement. Don't you usually check it?
The bathroom curtain is also broken. Don’t you understand that this inspection standard is not part of the waiter’s job responsibilities?
Overall: health is average, facilities are old, service is not bright, I am really sorry for the price, only once.

Regardless of the environment, service, and all aspects, it is very good and comfortable. It is also the hotel we stayed in for the longest time during this trip to Beijing, and it will still be our first choice in the future. During the Spring Festival holiday, other places are obviously understaffed, but the staff service here is still in place, and the details are also very good. It is obvious that the staff has undergone strict training.
The only downside is that eggs are fried in the breakfast hall. There is no fume extraction equipment, and the fumes can't escape indoors. It needs to be improved.

But some facilities are indeed slightly outdated. 1. There was light leakage from the curtains. I wanted to have a good rest, but I was woken up by the sun at 7 o'clock in the morning. . .
2. The shower equipment has mottled rust, the most important thing is that the water pressure is unstable, the water temperature is not constant, and the shower is hot and cold. . .
3. The TV is still an old small-sized LCD screen without an intelligent system.
It also costs more than 1,000 yuan, so living here may not be very cost-effective.

The content for the baby and the need to eat in the room were met in advance. The food and beverages are very rich, and the dining environment in the room is also good. The check-out was delayed until 3:00 p.m., and the housekeeper Xiao Zhao directly handled and delivered to the parking garage without queuing. The service from start to finish made our whole family very satisfied, and we will consider spending at Legendale again in the future.

The living room and bedroom are relatively independent, very suitable for receiving friends! I went early in the morning and couldn't check in yet. The front desk kindly inquired about the room number I stayed in last time. Knowing that I still wanted to stay in the previous room type, they kindly locked the room for me. Although the hotel is indeed a bit old, the fabric of the sofa has a strong sense of age, and it is quite comfortable to live in!

msg:The check-in experience can only be said to be okay. The exterior and interior design of the hotel are very beautiful. The room is large. Although the facilities are not modern enough, it is acceptable. The only complaint is that the service is really the same as none, not to mention that the service staff is required to be enthusiastic, at least When the guests need it, they should provide help. They dragged their luggage with their children and got off at the hotel, checked in, and went upstairs by the elevator. No hotel staff helped them all the way. The hotel is already open, but it’s not that there are no other staff members. The people who welcome guests at the door or the elevator entrance will stand there expressionless and motionless when you walk up to them, so it’s a good idea to arrange the staff to stand there with a serious face. For what reason, they don’t need them to open the door, and they don’t welcome guests. The family members walked in the wrong direction and said to the staff that this is the wrong direction, and the staff just stood there dumbly as if they didn’t hear it. Standing there with a serious face to supervise the guests? After check-in, the staff specifically emphasized that there are children. When providing disposable toothbrushes, they still did not provide children's toiletries. Compared with hotels of the same level, this service is really not satisfactory

It is almost the same when the light is turned on and not turned on. I can’t see clearly when looking for things in the suitcase at night. The sound insulation effect seems to be quite poor. When taking pictures in the corridor, people in the room will come out to make their voices quieter. When I returned to the room, the air conditioner was turned on so low that it was like an ice cellar. After I turned it off, it was still very cold and uncomfortable until I left the store the next day. No welcome fruit. The service attitude of the girls at the front desk is also quite bad, and the attitude of the boys is quite good. The guy at the door who helped carry the luggage was also very nice. But I probably won't come here for the second time. Generally speaking, it's still not very comfortable to live in. The most important thing is that the lighting is too poor.

He thinks that Legendale Hotel is the most beautiful hotel in Beijing. In fact, it is really good. The concierge depar**ent has prepared birthday lights and red wine and red wine glasses for the room. The a**osphere is full. If you don't want to Red wine can also choose the small cakes sent by the hotel. The room I booked when I checked in was less than 800 and it was really worth it. Forgot to mention, I also prepared a rose bath intimately, and the toiletries are also from L'Occitane. The whole room is designed in Baroque style. My favorite is the transparent window connecting the master bedroom to the bathroom. It's really beautiful. The decoration is relatively early, and the modern facilities are weaker. The shower head in the bath needs to adjust the hot and cold water by itself. The mattress can be improved. The length of the bed may be shorter, and it is not very friendly to tall people. The overall feeling is great ! Attaching some photos for reference!

There are some antique clocks, chandeliers, fireplaces, etc. The environment is great, and the service is also five-star. Standard, the water temperature of the swimming pool is good, the temperature of the water is just right for children to play, and you can take a bath after swimming. It's Liyuan Restaurant, so it's innocuous, but the room feels a little small. It is estimated that the large patio squeezes the room rate. It's a very satisfying weekend.

During the Mid-Autumn Festival, I experienced the old five-star hotel in Beijing because I heard that there is a European-style castle hotel on Jinbao Street. After working for so many years, I finally had the opportunity to sneak in and stay in this hotel on the pretext of watching the moon over the Mid-Autumn Festival. After entering the door, the young lady in the lobby is very beautiful, and everyone is very eye-catching; the service at the front desk is also very efficient, and the check-in is completed quickly. Take the card and go upstairs, every scene is resplendent. This time, I live in a garden-view room. The direction is southeast. You can see a small garden downstairs, and you can see the China World Business District and China Zun from the courtyard. The furnishings in the room can be seen to be a hotel with a long history. The feeling of various furniture has been weathered, but fortunately, it is normal to use. It is worth mentioning that I really like the smell of the toiletries in the L'Occitane Verbena series, and I am very satisfied this time. Looking out the window at night to see the full moon of Mid-Autumn Festival is very satisfying. By the way, there are quite a lot of Internet celebrities staying here, and some of them are quite eye-catching. Well, parking is free for guests, and I don't know who said they would charge for it.

Hygiene: Enter the room, clean and tidy, L'Occitane's toiletries are also considered high-end 😆
Catering: We chose the hotel package, including three meals a day and afternoon tea, which solved all the dietary problems of a family of three for two days✌✌
Service: The best thing is that we can check out late during the Golden Week of 11th October. The manager on duty not only helped us to check out until 1:00, but also reserved a heated swimming pool for us, so that we can play in the pool after we check out. happy! This service must be out of five stars 👍👍👍

The room contains two guests. Children under 1.2 meters are free, and children above 1.2 meters are half price. In addition, if you come by car, you can get half-price package coupons at the concierge. Very sweet.

After completing the check-in front desk, the children will be given two task cards. After completion, there will be corresponding gifts, which satisfies the children's curiosity and consumes a lot of physical strength. The best of both worlds! There are six antique treasures collected from France in the public area of the hotel. You can get a small gift by taking pictures at each stop of the "Legendary Treasure Hunting Manual" along the route of "Legendary Treasure Map" and sending them to social platforms. , candy or the puzzles of Legend Hotel, "Fun Questions and Answers for Cute Baby" is an advanced game, and then win small gifts 🎁 It is a customized Rubik's Cube with the appearance of the hotel. Children like it very much. It is entertaining and educational. Learn, this game is well arranged!

The room is very comfortable, and the scenery outside the window is very good. Looking up is the sunset, and looking down is Jinbao Street, which is full of traffic. It is very pleasant to rush to a cup of coffee and sit on the sofa beside the bed to watch the scenery! By the way, be sure to put on silk bathrobes and coral fleece slippers, too comfortable 😌 The bathroom is glittering with gold, and the gold parts of the bathroom are plated with real gold, which is absolutely extravagant.

After checking out the next day, a friend came to see me, so I asked to have lunch at the hotel's Chinese restaurant. It is said that this restaurant has been renovated. It is like entering the opera house. It is also very beautiful. This restaurant specializes in Jiangnan cuisine. Ordered the seasonal hairy crab "June Yellow", which was launched in the season. The fried rice cake with sauce fragrant June yellow, the cream is full of fat, the shell is thin and the meat is thick, and the golden cream will burst out when you break it. The slight spicy taste is very fresh. The rice cake inside is soft and glutinous, although it is a bit spicy, but children can't stop eating it! I also ordered: eel paste with sound oil, smoked fish in this gang, stuffed meat with oil gluten, noodles in red oil soup, chicken feet in abalone sauce, none of them are classics.

The swimming pool is my favorite hotel facility with my children. With a safe height of 1.2 meters, there is no pressure to swim. There are not many tourists, and almost all of them are reserved. After swimming, I go to a hot spring and a sauna, which is too tired!

Taking photos in the hotel is a beautiful photo, there are treasures everywhere, like a shuttle in a museum, but also like breaking into someone's palace, like a dream!

msg:The overall feeling of the hotel is good👍 some details are not in place! There are a lot of people who check in from the internet celebrity, which makes the hotel guests feel uncomfortable. This time, the set menu has three meals, and there is an afternoon tea. If you don’t have high requirements for food like me, you can order this set. If you are a friend who is coming to Beijing for the first time, you can book a room directly! There is a lot to eat around, there is no need to eat in the hotel! It's like a chicken rib, it's a pity that it's tasteless and discarded! The hotel's bath products are still good. It's L'Occitane that I like! The hotel is very close to Union Hospital, Wangfujing Street, Dongdan and Dongsi! Suitable for family travel!

Finally, the luggage was sent to the 15th floor. Very proactive and patient. In the French restaurant of Legend Hotel. I also met the restaurant manager Chen (my name) who treated every dining guest very professionally. He was enthusiastic without losing etiquette. We stayed for one day and had four meals in the French restaurant (afternoon tea. Dinner, Breakfast and lunch on the second day) Manager Chen stood at the door to greet the guests with a smile. During the meal, he introduced him patiently, received each diners courteously, and reflected professional catering management and professionalism everywhere. Legend Hotel has a good reputation and good business. Can't live without such a good employee! The package at Legendale Hotel this time is really affordable. It is a very satisfying and pleasant experience. I hope that the business of Legendale Hotel will be prosperous and the financial resources will be prosperous!

msg:Legendale Hotel Beijing is a French royal castle next to the Forbidden City, with a French style close at hand. There is a strong and elegant 19th-century Parisian style and a blend of Chinese and Western cultures everywhere. Magnificent French design style, classical furniture and unique ceiling From the lobby, corridors, elevators, restaurants to room layout and decoration, it seems to return to the magnificent and elegant temperament, and it seems to return to France in an instant. The room is also retro, full of French style, suitable for Internet celebrities to punch cards. The room is full of details and the software is advanced. The washbasin and shower faucet in the bathroom are two retro 24k gold-plated hot water, which is only available in a classical and luxurious hotel. It is different from a faucet in a modern hotel. The guest amenities in the room are a full set of L'Occitane, the bathrobes are silk on the surface and towel lining, and the slippers are coral fleece, all of which are very luxurious and comfortable guest products. The well-equipped fitness center on the second floor is also a good place to fully relax. Executive floor rooms and all types of suites include executive floor trea**ent, and enjoy four meals a day for up to two people in the executive lounge, currently dining in the French restaurant. Four meals including breakfast, selected lunches, afternoon tea and selected dinners are excellent value for money. In Legendale Hotel Hao Jiangxuan Chinese Restaurant and Beatui French Restaurant, the dishes are dazzling and rich in variety. Hao Jiangxuan Chinese Restaurant also launched the seasonal hairy crab "June Yellow" in the season. June Yellow, Sauce-flavored June Yellow Fried Rice Cake, and Salt Baked June Yellow in Casserole. Each dish is full of oin**ent and fat, with thin shell and thick meat. As soon as you break it off, the golden oin**ent will burst out. It is sweet and smooth, with a faint aroma of wine. It is also a good choice to order a set of afternoon tea in front of the huge floor-to-ceiling windows. The location is superior to the Forbidden City and Wangfujing. It is very convenient to visit Wangfujing, the Forbidden City, Qianmen and Dongdan in one step. There are also hotel guests who can receive a coupon at the front desk to enjoy a 50% discount on parking in the underground parking lot, which is a worry-free and affordable stay.

At the intersection of Jinbao Street, there is a luxury hotel that has been in business for more than 10 years. The moment you step into the Legend Hotel, you will travel from "Beijing" to "Medieval Europe". 👸🏻
Luxurious staircases, hotel atriums, domes, antique artworks, classical furniture... This is like a small antique art exhibition, there are so many good places to take pictures📸📸
I won’t work overtime this weekend, I decided to book a suite with my boyfriend, and prepare for a leisurely vacation~🤩
The room is big and clean, with all the facilities, as soon as you enter the door, you will see a welcome gift🎁 It is very thoughtful!
We ate a total of 4 meals, afternoon tea, dinner, breakfast, lunch (I can't say anything with my chubby belly satisfied 😊) I like the semi-buffet dinner very much. The main course is a la carte, and the rest are optional at the buffet, except Regular fruit juice drinks, as well as white rum, whiskey and other foreign wines~🥃Too appetizing for little alcoholics hahahaha
The lunch on the second day was served at Haojiang Xuan Jiangnan Cuisine Chinese Restaurant, which gathered the five flavors and six flavors of Jiangnan, 🥢 fused the essence of Chinese cuisine, and the elite chefs showed their exquisite skills to create authentic and pure Jiangnan cuisine. I thoroughly enjoyed the process, it is undoubtedly the happy ending of this "micro-vacation"🧸🧸🧸
In short, whether you come to Beijing for business or pleasure, or you want to spend a weekend in the city, you can't go wrong with staying at Legendale Hotel~🥳

In terms of meals, to be honest, dinner is not as delicious as breakfast. Of course, the price is here, and there should be no extravagant expectations.

msg:The child is on summer vacation, and just brought it out to play. Wangfujing area is a must-choice. I feel that the appearance of this hotel on Ctrip is like a European-style castle. It fits, so I booked it right away!
When checking in at the front desk, because of the elderly and children, the front desk of the hotel recommended the hotel's prestige club package. After the room is upgraded to the prestige club room or business suite, you can enjoy the trea**ent of the executive floor. There are 4 meals provided, which perfectly solves the problem of foraging!
🏨The suite 1608 we upgraded this time is very auspicious, 🧓Happy😃, the child feels good scenery because of the high floor, also 👌!
🏠: Walking into the room, you can't help but sigh, it really feels like a European castle 🏰 The room is decorated in platinum tones, the oversized living room is magnificent, you can read books or meet guests, and you can watch TV outside 📺, the sofa is very comfortable !
The bedroom inside is also very good, the big bed is very comfortable, you don't want to get up when you lie down, you can also lie down on the beautiful couch by the window to take a nap!
The bathroom is also amazing, there are two choices of 🛁 and 🚿, the overall style is that European retro luxury style, full of palace feeling, I instantly feel that the decision to upgrade the room type is very good!
After checking in, I found that I was a little hungry. I happened to have afternoon tea with my friends and went to the French restaurant on the second floor. I felt that the environment was worthy of our costumes. It was like walking into a European museum, with huge oil paintings and European-style decoration. All show the elegance and a**osphere of this place. The guests and hosts enjoyed this afternoon tea, and they also harvested a lot of beautiful photos!
🥣I chose Haojiang Chinese Restaurant for dinner. At first I thought it would be very expensive. After I took a look at the menu, I was relieved. The price is very reasonable. The main portion is large. Yes, they are all online. I personally recommend Cantonese dim sum 🥧, braised pork and kung pao shrimp balls are also praised 👍
Take a hot bath at night to wash away the fatigue of the day, and then have a good sleep!
Breakfast is also on the second floor. Although there are not many kinds of food, it is rich enough for me. A cup of coffee ☕️ an omelette 🍳 a bowl of noodles 🍜 makes me extremely satisfied, children also think the noodles are delicious, and the elderly 👵 may prefer porridge Some!
I went out for a walk around the neighborhood in the morning, the room can be postponed, and I happily went to have a lunch, a French restaurant, in the form of a semi-buffet➕ main dish, which is convenient and affordable. The last main course, even more delicious!
Transportation: You can choose 🚖 or 🚇
🚇 Exit B of Dengshikou Station, Line 5, about 50 meters away!
Hygiene: The hotel's hygiene is very good. The rooms and public areas are clean and tidy. Although there are many guests, it is not messy at all.
Service: very looking for, especially a young man at afternoon tea, super nice, provides us with everything we need, and is not impatient at all, must give 100 likes!

The general environment of the hotel has been maintained well. After all, it has been in business for many years. Some problems seem to be inconspicuous. The room attendant should pay attention to it when cleaning, and it must be repaired or replaced as soon as possible (see the last two pictures, nails). The water quality of the swimming pool is almost there. A children's swimming class, too messy, others are good!

msg:The room was clean and large. Every waiter was very friendly and had a good attitude. Included afternoon tea and meals are okay too. For lunch and dinner, each room now chooses two of the four main dishes, and the rest is a simple buffet. There are Chinese and Western food for breakfast, but they are relatively simple. In short, if you are in a hotel, it is enough. The water in the swimming pool is clean and requires an appoin**ent. It is 1.2M deep and suitable for children to play. Room service is also prompt and responsive. Not bad anyway.

msg:The hotel is European-style, resplendent and luxurious, and the check in wait time is long. The room is large and has all the facilities. The bathroom is separated from wet and dry. The bathroom design is not regular. The shower area is a bit narrow inside. The toilet has no separate door, which will be a little inconvenient. I ordered a four-meals premium package, all of which were served in a French restaurant. The facilities were a bit outdated, the seats were close, and the lighting was not romantic enough. During the afternoon tea time, there were bear children chasing and playing and it was a little noisy. At dinner time, the satisfaction gradually improved, and by lunchtime the next day, the favorability doubled. There are four main dishes to choose from for each meal, and the buffet area has unlimited supply of hot dishes, cold dishes, drinks, desserts, snacks, etc. The dishes are all delicious, and it's so affordable. If it weren't for the price of 1,200 yuan during the epidemic, I would never be able to get it. Overall very satisfied.

msg:When we talk about Legend Hotel, what are we talking about?
Internet celebrity hotel? "Palace of Versailles"? "Dream back to Portugal"? "Castle"?

I suddenly wanted to go out last weekend, and temporarily opened all the homestays in the suburbs.
When I was disheartened, I went to the Legend Hotel
At a glance, the price is only 700+! weekend! (excluding breakfast)
Almost half the price of various suburban homestays!
Is there a reason to refuse?
As a "parent-child hotel", it may be a little thin, because there are no amu*****t facilities
But kids who like swimming will definitely like it,
After all, we seemed to be contracting the entire pool that weekend afternoon!

Special toiletries and bathrobes for children
Afraid that the children would be bored, they also sent a "treasure hunt" map
From the 2nd floor to the 1st floor underground, find the corresponding "treasure" and send it to social media
You will get a small gift (hotel puzzle and a bottle of drink)

The hotel manager and receptionist are very friendly
Takeaways have dedicated shelves for easy pickup and delivery

msg:Two-day in-depth hotel tour on weekends, let’s talk about the overall feeling first. It’s a great experience, and I want to go again, but there are indeed a few unsatisfactory places.
The whole hotel has a European palace style, and it feels like a king when you are in it. From the third underground floor to the seventeenth floor, it is the hotel's own, which is very beautiful and easy to visit.
The implementation of epidemic prevention measures is particularly in place. No matter where you go to the hotel, you need to scan the code, understand and support, so as to ensure everyone's safety.
The room is big, clean and tidy, the sound insulation effect is super good, the open corridor, so many floor rooms, can't hear any noise. The items and other equipment are very complete, the bedding is clean and comfortable, the mattress is very comfortable, the air conditioning is sufficient, the temperature can be adjusted, and the stay is very good.
The food is good, the taste is rich, the service staff is warm and polite, the lunch and dinner are Western-style ordering, and the breakfast buffet is relatively rich. The overall feeling is good, but I am a little dissatisfied. There are many people for dinner, and the speed of serving food is very slow. We can understand this. After all, five-star hotels must ensure the quality of meals and dining experience. However, one of the main dishes we ordered has never been served. After being urged once, the waiter went to the kitchen and turned back to check with us, but it still never came. When I urged the second time, the waiter seemed to be lighthearted and said, "They said they've done it to you, so I'll go to remind you again", which made people feel very uncomfortable. But I didn't say anything. In the end, the main food came up, which was very unsatisfactory. Everything else was good.
During the epidemic, the fitness center needs to make an appoin**ent, and the management is in place. The swimming pool is not big, there are not many people, the water temperature is very suitable, and it is very comfortable to stay in it. Saunas and steam baths are open as normal. The gym is a bit small, but the equipment is adequate. The whole is very clean, and there are plastic bags in the bathroom, which is quite thoughtful.
Great service, thoughtful and thoughtful, overall is good, but there is a small problem. When checking in, the front desk provided disposable supplies for adults, and told the children that they would be delivered to the room, but after ten o'clock in the evening, no one came to deliver them. I called the front desk and asked for it myself, which is not a good feeling, said I can be picky, but after all, it is a five-star hotel, and guests still have expectations for service quality! By the way, the hotel has a treasure game for children. After completing it, it will give you a small gift, which is very good and a surprise.
Overall, a very satisfying holiday experience!

msg:On the weekend when the forecast temperature is as high as 40 degrees, choose to take your children to the Legend Hotel for swimming and treasure hunting to escape the sweltering heat.
Now the price of the suite is very favorable, including three meals and one afternoon tea. The arrangement is clear and clear, and there is no need to leave the hotel. It can be seen that the hotel product manager has made great efforts to cope with the impact of the epidemic on the hotel, and is very attentive, attracting many local customers like us to spend the weekend.
🚗 Transportation: Needless to say, the location is superior. The hotel has a 50% discount on parking, which is much more affordable than the luxury hotels in China World Trade Center.
🧹Sanitation: The sanitary conditions are very good, the bath towels are hot and fragrant, the only dissatisfaction is that the years are old, the carpets are a little old, and the lockers have a musty smell of wood.
🍃Environment: Palace style, but because of the sophisticated materials and careful maintenance, it is gorgeous and not gaudy. Attracted a lot of people to take pictures and punch cards. However, I don't like a few scantily clad and vulgar women who stay in the lobby bar for a few hours (from 2 pm to 8 pm) and keep taking pictures forever. Are they really embarrassed?
Service: very good, decent, elegant, not overly enthusiastic, but responsive.
Should come again for the weekend.

msg:I originally planned to have a good and comfortable holiday, but I didn't expect the experience to be so bad. First of all, the most important thing in a hotel is service and environment. In my opinion, both of these are not very good. Picture 1 and picture 2 are in the hotel kettle. Uncleaned tea residues and unidentified objects that have dried out of the water outlet (leftovers from the previous guest). Picture 3 is the blue dirty things on the bed sheets that have not been cleaned. Picture 4 and 5 show that there are flies in the room! And without opening the window, after calling the hotel, I gave a mosquito repellant (it didn't work at all), and then a waiter came with a towel to fight the flies. It really hit a lonely fly. How do you fly? ! There is no leak in the hotel toilet and water will accumulate. As for the damage of the sofa on the wall, it is understandable that it is in disrepair and then it is the service. From the check-in front desk at the door, it was very cold and loudly told me about the remarks about the room before. Personal feelings and feelings Not very good will make people embarrassed, and then the customer service of the service center feels arrogant and cold (the customer service in the restaurant has a very good tone and is very enthusiastic and very satisfied, and the door-to-door waiter is also more enthusiastic) The most important thing is that the waiter actually used it privately The universal room card came in in the early morning! Without telling me! Guests have no privacy at all! Never met! Is this a mistake a five-star hotel should make? ! (Please remember to lock the door before checking in!)
   The environment of the hotel is very beautiful, especially suitable for taking pictures, especially the corridors of the rooms!

After all, it is an old-fashioned hotel with slightly outdated facilities. But it does not affect its magnificence at all, and it is a blockbuster when it is shot.

Coupled with the beautiful atrium design, I already love it. Stayed three nights in a row. The room is very quiet, and you can hardly meet other tenants when you go out, as if you are sitting in a big castle. The interior is ok, after all, some years, but classic. The hardware is super satisfied anyway. The only surprise is that the software service seems to be quite satisfactory, there is not too much humane or warm bonus service, such as fruit delivery or something. The cost is not high, but the tenant will feel more "at home". Hope it can be improved. Let go of the high-cold attitude and be warmer. Overall quite satisfied, will come to live.

There is a large hall on the ground floor, as well as antique crystal lamps, conference rooms, etc. The hotel has complete facilities, swimming pool, sauna, gym, haircut, and spa. The swimming sauna is open until 11:00, and the spa is open until 2:00 at night. The room is very beautiful, the bathroom is too delicate, behind the toilet door, the sink cabinet door are all mirrors.
Hygiene: the bathroom is clean, the carpet in the room has imprints, but it is acceptable. It will inevitably change color over time. The bed was comfortable and the quilt was hot. Toiletries are L'Occitane.
Catering: The suite is paired with lunch, dinner and afternoon tea, with simple meals written. The variety of meals is limited, but acceptable, there is no problem with eating enough, one main course per person, salad fruit drinks and small pizza buffet. There is still room for improvement in food taste. Afternoon tea desserts are sweeter.
During the epidemic, I felt that there were fewer people staying in the hotel, and the building was very quiet, but it was also very enjoyable. The all-inclusive price is more cost-effective, with meals and convenient, very close to Wangfujing Pedestrian Street, convenient for shopping, it is a good choice

Breakfast is buffet, lunch and dinner are à la carte, and the matching is very reasonable. Unfortunately, there is no pastry for afternoon tea. There is a subway station near the entrance of the hotel, and it is very close to Wangfujing Pedestrian Street, which is very convenient for shopping and play. In short, the opportunity will come to live in the future! ! !

msg:The hotel lobby and restaurant, which were usually slightly noisy, are now extraordinarily quiet during this extraordinary period. The window seat of the French restaurant faces the former residence of Mr. Cai Yuanpei. The artwork in the hotel makes you feel like you are in a palace of art. The number of guests has dropped sharply, but the service has not been discounted, and everyone is smiling. I especially like Miss Shi, the duty manager for solving problems for the guests in a timely manner. The simple meal for two included in the administrative courtesy is much more refined than the so-called simple meal provided by the administrative courtesy of some other big-name five-star hotels in Beijing. The service is also in place as always, without any decline. . I have stayed in several other five-star hotels during the epidemic, and the services have been more or less discounted. Legend's gym, swimming pool, and sauna are still open all day, until 11 pm, which is too rare. In some hotels, due to the sudden drop in guests during the epidemic, the swimming pool and gym are either closed or only open for half a day in the afternoon.
The room is very convenient, whether it is on the bedside or the USD socket of the writing desk.
Located in Jinbao Street, it is a quiet holiday, the first choice for business trips.

msg:The location is excellent, the front desk is efficient, and the executive lounge trea**ent of the suite has been changed to three meals ➕ afternoon tea. The main dishes of the catering are the same level of simple meals as advertised, especially the main dishes of Western chefs are a bit difficult to evaluate, including semi-buffet dishes, the level of Chinese chefs is relatively stable, such as Cantonese-style brine roasted goose, etc. (main dishes) Except for a certain beef noodle), I hope the production of the main dish can be slightly optimized. One of the spotlights in the bedroom of the suite cannot be properly illuminated, and the humidifier cannot be turned on. It is recommended to readjust the room lighting switch. The facilities in the room need to be checked. There is a strange thing, I don't know if it is a holiday during the stay, there are many people, whether it is the cleaning, restaurant, lobby hotel staff, they feel hiding when they meet, walk away quickly, and greet the image of the past warmly The difference is quite large.

🧹 Hygiene: Overall good, hygiene is good

🍃Environment: Needless to say, the Internet celebrity released the film, the building is beautiful and shocking, and the details everywhere are European style

🔔Service: It is relatively down, the overall staff lacks awareness, the waiter in the restaurant has the best service, the room service staff is less responsible, not enough to focus on the needs of the guests, the front desk service is not professional enough, the voice is loud, and the hotel facade is not enough to take into account the feelings of the guests.

Overall, the price-performance ratio is very high. After all, it is not an international group hotel chain. The service is average, but for the sake of taking pictures, the restaurant is also good. It is not as bad as other reviews say. Professionally trained hotel groups like Marriott Hilton are a far cry from that. The flaws do not hide the beauty.

The desserts are super exquisite and the service is also good. The main reason is that the price is high. When I booked 1422, now 1390, I recommend my friends to go with my children to take the children, I plan to go when I have a chance, it is worth mentioning that the toiletries are from L'Occitane, ladies like it😊

msg:Take the two babies to check in the European-style palace retro hotel in the heart of Beijing - Legendale Hotel Beijing
The first impression of the hotel is the magnificent visual impact, the symmetrical structural architectural design, the European-style palace decoration style, and the photos are very good! The European-style palace style gives people a warm and indifferent feeling~
I have to recommend the executive suite I stayed in for the experience of bringing a baby. The children can play wildly in the room for a day. It is worth mentioning that in addition to the high quality and good price, all the executive floors can also enjoy the double day four at the Jade French restaurant on the second floor of the hotel. The super gift of the meal (afternoon tea, dinner, breakfast and lunch the next day), I thought the price would be very perfunctory, but the actual taste is quite good ~ it is really a super cost-effective choice for walking babies! By the way, the executive suite can also check out until 3 pm!

msg:Now Beijing and Shanghai are popular in their own cities for vacation, there is no way, not only can't go abroad, but it is difficult to go domestically, so I chose Legendale Hotel. Let’s talk about the location first. It’s very close to Wangfujing. You can walk to the Forbidden City, Jingshan, Beihai, and art museums. Besides, the style of Legendale Hotel Beijing is particularly European in appearance. The grey roof seems to be like being in Paris. Anyway, you can't go abroad, so choose a city vacation with your own personality, and you should live in a luxury hotel in Paris!

The main building of Legendale Hotel is enclosed, so friends who are afraid of the tail room need not worry, there is no tail room at all. The whole room is also European-style retro design. The curtains, furnishings, decorations, and oil paintings have a particularly unified style. Even the mirror above the bedroom door is also an old-fashioned design, showing a good look. The faucet in the bathroom is 24k gold-plated, and the hot and cold water are separated, which is how a classical luxury hotel is configured. There are quite a lot of European-style hotels, but there are not many that have quality and high standards.

The scenery outside the window of Legendale Hotel is full of scenery. From my window, I can see the buildings of the East Third Ring Road and Chang'an Street, and some can also see Wangfujing, the Forbidden City and Jingshan. Just in time for the first snow in Beijing in 2022, it is really beautiful. The bathroom accessories are a full set of L'Occitane, the surface of the bathrobe is silk and the inside is a towel, and the slippers are coral fleece, which is very comfortable to use. The flowers in the living room are all real flowers, and the roses in the bathroom are also real flowers. Legend is too particular about it.

The executive suite on the 15th floor can enjoy the trea**ent of the executive lounge, including four meals a day for two people, afternoon tea and dinner on the day of check-in, as well as breakfast and lunch the next day. There are both Western and Chinese food. . In general, there is no lunch in the executive lounge of the hotel, and dinner is also very simple, not as grand as Legendale. At present, these four meals are enjoyed at the Beicui French Restaurant on the 2nd floor, and outside the window is the former residence of Cai Yuanpei.

When I arrived at Legendale Hotel, many people were enjoying afternoon tea in the lobby bar in the atrium. There were quite a lot of guests in the hotel. The lobby is too European-style, and the high atrium space is especially like a castle. The fireplace in the middle is said to be a real antique, and there are some antique clocks, all of which are hundreds or hundreds of years old collected from Europe. The fitness center is located on the 2nd floor, which can fully relax and leisure, which is indispensable for a vacation in the city. In-house guests can also receive coupons at the front desk and enjoy a 50% discount on the underground parking lot.

msg:🚿 Legendale Hotel Beijing丨Every detail is worth savoring

🛎People usually think that what is left after the prosperity has retreated is the memory that will not be forgotten by people. Today, the “old” hotels with retro personality, full of details and nostalgic complexes are more time-consuming than modern luxury hotels.

🗝Beijing Legend Hotel is such an existence. The architectural appearance of the hotel draws on the European neoclassical style. The beige exterior walls are integrated, and the natural style is mysterious and low-key among the surrounding buildings. The room continues the neoclassical style, and every delicate carving is ingenious.

🪜The neoclassical color scheme inherits the elegant charm of European classics. The hollow ring design above the lobby makes the white, gold, dark red, and yellow in the neoclassical color scheme even better. The rooms are set up in a circle. From the lobby to the top floor, they are all hollow cylinders with warm lighting. Their natural and heavy texture seems to be trying to pull people back to the golden age where wonderful stories and moving legends are hidden...

🛁 I stayed in a suite this time. The room is full of details, so people have to express their admiration to the team who designed the hotel after careful consideration. The most surprising is the unique retro valve design of the bathroom faucet, which maximizes the sense of ritual while being practical. The hotel has seven restaurants, ranging from French to Cantonese, with a wide variety of dishes. Ordering a set of afternoon tea in front of the huge floor-to-ceiling windows, and being in a daze, is not a happy thing.

As always, the European-style architecture and the exquisite interior furnishings make you feel as if you are bathing in the breeze, which is extremely comfortable. More importantly, the executive floor is not only of high quality and good price. , you can also enjoy the super gift of two-day, four-meals at the 'French Restaurant' on the second floor of the hotel. The perfect combination of morning, noon, evening and afternoon tea is great! Worth a try!

msg:Legendale Hotel Beijing is one of the Beijing hotels that I have always wanted to stay in. Taking advantage of the children's winter vacation, the whole family came for a weekend vacation in the city. I have to say, this is definitely the best treasure hotel in Europe in one second.

The lobby has an empty palace-like beauty, and it is worthy of being the most popular check-in place in the capital! The room is also super spacious, with gorgeous decorations like living in a palace!

After seeing the strategies posted by other friends, I realized that there are still six treasures hidden in this hotel, all of which are antiques collected by the boss and are of great value. They are displayed on the second, first and ba*****t floors of the hotel. Take the kids to check in for treasure hunts and take pictures, and get a puzzle gift! Simply so much fun!

His restaurant is also great! The French restaurant on the second floor is like an art gallery! You can have afternoon tea, breakfast, lunch and dinner here. The Chinese restaurant on the ground floor is also super delicious!

I love this hotel so much and will continue to bring my family here!

msg:It has been nine years since the last time I stayed at the Legendale Hotel. Every year at the end of the year, some feelings emerge, and I suddenly thought of whether I should go to experience the current Legendary hotel again? On Ctrip, I saw that there is a "four-meal package" activity for staying in an executive suite. The price is also quite cost-effective, so I quickly placed the order.

Checked in after 2pm, the room was sunny and received a fruit plate and chocolate. Spreading out on the sofa and basking in the sun just doesn't want to move... This is the correct way to enjoy the afternoon in the northern winter!

The rooms on the executive floor can not only check out until three o'clock, but also include four meals a day, including breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea and dinner. The dining places are all in the French restaurant on the second floor. In fact, there is an executive lounge on the 16th floor, but it is not currently open. According to my memory, the executive lounge does not have many seats, and it is not as spacious and bright as the French restaurant, so I think this temporary adjus**ent is not bad!

I heard that the breakfast is a very rich buffet, but I was too lazy to get up (the bed was so comfortable), I slept until noon hahahaha, I went straight downstairs to have lunch, and I could choose appetizers, soups, main dishes, Dessert, free combination, very convenient, also includes a variety of soft drinks, hot tea and coffee. Dinner is also very rich, including Chinese and Western-style cold and hot dishes, and so on.

Although the free afternoon tea is not as "luxury" as the lobby on the first floor, I think it is quite attentive and exquisite in the hotel's executive afternoon tea. If you like quiet, the environment here is more suitable, praise!

Finally, I would like to praise the hotel's "New Year's taste". Red lanterns and blessing characters can be seen everywhere. It is very interesting to collide with the retro European style. In fact, it is also quite good to have a New Year's Eve dinner at a Chinese restaurant here!

msg:Due to various policy reasons, the original vacation plan can only be cancelled and stay in Beijing. However, the feeling of wanting to take a vacation has not diminished at all, so I chose a weekend, found a hotel in the city that has always been planting grass, and came to a city vacation plan that said that I would live there.

Every time I passed by the Wangfujing area before, I would be attracted by the appearance of Legendale Hotel! It feels like a castle. I heard that it opened in 2008. Even though it has been more than ten years, it is still very beautiful. It is like Versailles! Some time ago, I had a meal in the hotel's Chinese restaurant, and then I was planted again by the hotel's decoration. Luxurious European-style, imposing 17-storey atrium-style structure is simply too much! So I always wanted to come and live for two days to experience it. So I checked the price this time and found that it was very suitable, so I placed the order directly.

When I came here, it happened to be the afternoon of the weekend, and there were many people checking in. This time, I stayed in the executive suite on the 15th floor of the hotel. The classic style of the hotel has continued from the public space to the room. The classical furniture in the living room and the design of the European-style ceiling really have a feeling of being in southern Europe. The large bed in the bedroom is very comfortable to lie on, and the wide glass window next to it has an excellent view. From the residential house in front of you to the Guomao in the distance, it seems that you can see the modern and modern from Homecoming in Beijing at a glance.

The bathroom space is impressively large, and it also reflects the retro elements incisively and vividly. The faucet of the washbasin is divided into two hot and cold, and is plated with gold, which is basically the standard configuration of classical hotels. The bath accessories are a full set of L'Occitane, and the scent is the type I like. Don't forget to wear your hotel bathrobe after taking a shower! The surface is silk and the inside of the towel is super comfortable! !

The hotel's executive courtesy includes four meals from breakfast, lunch to afternoon tea and dinner. Since the executive lounge is currently not open, all meals are served in the hotel's French restaurant. There are not many types of afternoon tea, but the a**osphere is very good, and the breakfast tastes good. It can be said that the price is still very high. Because I happened to have friends nearby on weekends, I ate dinner at another Chinese restaurant. The dishes of Jiangnan flavor, eel paste, gluten stuffed meat, and smoked fish were all very good! It should be there for dinner later.

msg:Finally successfully checked in this castle 🏰 hotel, a very perfect check-in experience, all-inclusive food, drink and fun, super cost-effective (the price is very beautiful) can't help but give a five-star praise! It’s winter vacation, but it’s recommended not to be in Beijing this year, so I will look for the 𝐒𝐓𝐀𝐘𝐂𝐀𝐓𝐈𝐎𝐍 urban resort hotel on Ctrip as soon as possible. This way of vacationing without the need for cars and horses has been very popular in the past two years. I didn’t expect to find a treasure!

As soon as they entered the hotel, the children shouted like walking into a fairy tale castle. The neoclassical staircase in the lobby, the huge oil paintings and antique clocks that can be seen everywhere, instantly travel back to the Middle Ages. This time, I originally booked a normal room type on Ctrip. When I checked in at the front desk, I found that the executive floor rooms and all suites included four meals a day, including breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea and dinner. It is very convenient for families to travel with one price and all-inclusive, so I made an immediate decision. House!

The retro design of the suite is so beautiful, it is a bit unexpected (so you must upgrade to a suite, it is very good!), and the background of the window is also the facade of Legend Castle, as if you are on vacation in Europe, and you are in a good mood instantly😃! The retro bedroom door of the suite 🚪Love it, the old mirror glass above is very high-end and unique!
From this perspective, whether it is sitting on the bed and seeing the outside through the crack of the door, or another perspective (the first picture I am super satisfied with ☺️) is a must. Put on the bathrobe and lay down on the bed to have a good rest. I have to say that Legend's products are very luxurious and comfortable. The bathrobe is made of silk on the surface and towel inside, the slippers are coral fleece, the bedding is skin-friendly and comfortable, and the toiletries are also L'Occitane. . Oh, yes, I have to sigh in the bathroom! The faucets of the washbasin and shower are all 24k gold-plated. I feel that this is a standard standard only for a classical luxury hotel. The hotel that I lived in Paris for hundreds of years before has such a texture, although Beijing Legend has more than ten years. However, the hardware protection of the guest room is very perfect, so the stay is very comfortable, which is very important for parent-child travel! like!

Due to the epidemic, breakfast is currently only arranged in a French restaurant. It is simple, but the variety is complete. Lunch and dinner are arranged in French and Chinese food. The environment is super beautiful. If you go early, you can choose the most beautiful location. Happy! Afternoon tea can be used in the lobby or in the French restaurant~ After dinner, you can also come to the swimming pool on the second floor. The swimming pool is also Roman style, and the water temperature is 28°C and the water depth is only 1.2m, which is very suitable for children~

📸Strategy
Because I am a heavy photography lover, I do my homework before coming. It is recommended to wear: white / black / red / champagne gold dress, take pictures yyds!

☑️ Lobby stairs (shot down from the second floor, this perspective exudes a sense of luxury)
☑️ Afternoon tea in the lobby with classic tea seats (opposite the entrance)
☑️French restaurant on the second floor (before Napoleon's huge oil painting)
☑️ Chinese restaurant on the ground floor (red private room)
☑️Elevator room
☑️ Executive floor atrium (circular railing is simple)
☑️Executive suite (every angle in the room is easy to take)

Tips:
It is especially recommended to stay in a suite, with all-inclusive four meals a day, which is really convenient!
Guests staying at the hotel remember to get a parking coupon at the front desk, and they can also enjoy a 50% discount on ba*****t parking, which is cheaper than taking a taxi. This is a very thoughtful consideration by the hotel!

If you can't go out of Beijing during the Chinese New Year, you can't let the bear children rebel at home [cover your face] The Legend Hotel in Wangfujing has a strong French style, and staying in the hotel is like being in a French castle. France prefers gold, and gold decoration can be seen everywhere in the hotel, which is luxurious and high-end. The scenery outside the hotel is also good. You can see Jingshan and the Forbidden City from the room. Currently, guests who book a suite can enjoy four meals a day on the executive floor. The hotel's swimming pool is also very friendly to children, with a water depth of 1.2 meters and a water temperature of 29 degrees. Children can play freely in the cold winter. Children can also participate in the hotel's free "Looking for Antique Treasures" activity. They can get small gifts when they find treasures and take pictures. It is very interesting and entertaining.

Second, live well. I booked a suite. There were activities including three meals at that time, which was really cost-effective. The room is big and very quiet. The experience of staying was very good.

Also, the service attitude of the staff is very good. Both the room and the restaurant are great. Really great for a city break.

There are still a lot of dissatisfaction points. I don’t want to write it. I don’t know if this review can be seen by the hotel. I hope that it will be seen and the hotel will pay attention. In addition, the room is very small, and the price/performance ratio is too bad.

msg:Very good hotel and would like to choose again. The cultural a**osphere is strong, like a museum, where you can see and learn a lot of historical knowledge. Feel the European style culture. The front desk service is enthusiastic, proactive, meticulous and thoughtful. I stayed for a day and felt very good, so I invited my friends to come and experience it. The front desk not only arranged us together, but also carefully told us the services and precautions we should enjoy. Room service is on call. The restaurant service is also considerate. Friends had a good stay and said that this hotel is very worthwhile to stay again.

msg:🌇 Legendale Hotel is an Internet celebrity hotel in Beijing, where you can experience the most magnificent visual impact. Symmetrical structural architectural design, European-style palace decoration style, very suitable for photography, it is also a good place for photography enthusiasts.

🌃 At first glance, the beige exterior wall gives people a warm and indifferent emotion. It looks low-key but extremely mysterious in many high-rise buildings, which makes people want to find out. Entering the hotel is also very in line with the appearance expectations. Standing on the top floor of the hotel, leaning over and looking down, it is resplendent and dazzling, and it feels like being in an imperial palace.

🥘 During the days I stayed at the hotel, I ate three meals a day and lunch at the Beacon French Restaurant on the second floor. Whether in terms of accommodation or food, Legend has done a very good job in line with its own temperament. Decorate the walls with marble for a somber ambience and pave with royal blue rugs for a visual impact. There are crystal lamps hanging high above the head, and the small partners in various restaurants show the details of Legend, making everything look high-end and a**osphere.

📍The hotel is located on Jinbao Street, Dongcheng District. The transportation is very convenient. The airport express line goes directly to the door of the hotel, and the subway and walking are very convenient. Wangfujing and Sanlitun are also near Legendale. When you are bored, you can see the special places in Beijing as soon as you step out of the hotel door.

❤️Although it has been 14 years since Legend Hotel opened, its style and decoration are still magnificent. Walking in the hotel, I feel like I am in a movie scene, I am the protagonist in the hotel 😎

msg:It’s not bad to take children on weekends. Let’s talk about the advantages first: 1: The hotel is in a good location, just beside Wangfujing, and it is very convenient to go shopping; 2: The service staff of the hotel has a good sense of service, 3: The hotel environment is very good, both the facilities and the decoration style. Yes, it is suitable for punching in and taking pictures, and the European style is very photogenic. 4: The room facilities are good and clean. I booked a suite. The overall feeling is good and clean.
Let's talk about the shortcomings: 1: The hotel's food and beverages are very general, do not meet the standard of five-star hotels, basically barely a four-star hotel (not as good as some four-star hotels), the dishes are very special and very few and forever. I've seen a change. Tomatoes scrambled with eggs, mushrooms, chicken nuggets, fish nuggets, plus a green vegetable are basically gone. There are only 2 or 3 kinds of cakes, and I don't mention fruits. I don't have ice cream. There is basically no difference between lunch and dinner, the dining area is very small, and there are many people queuing up. 2: There is a fee for parking. Although there is a 50% discount for staying at the hotel, it is also 100 yuan less for parking for one night.

msg:I planned to spend the Spring Festival at the hotel for three days during the Chinese New Year, including three meals➕ afternoon tea. First of all, the service is basically more enthusiastic and better, and they take the initiative to say hello when they meet. It was only after seeing other children participating in treasure hunts and carrying bears that we knew there were activities and gifts for children. No one took the initiative to tell this, so embarrassing is still the bear I asked for. The swimming pool is not big, the water temperature is 29 degrees, and the baby is more comfortable to swim. The hotel has been open for many years, so the carpets look piece by piece, but the room is still neatly cleaned and the clothes are folded. The drinks are replenished in time. The worst thing is the dining bar. One night in the French restaurant, you can order baby meals. Because the children are arranged in the cafe for the New Year, there is basically nothing to eat for children. They rely on breakfast all day, and they lose a pound or two after staying for three days in the new year. And the dishes are basically the same every day. The hotel has a lion dance on the first day of the new year, which has a Chinese New Year a**osphere. Remarks that the room is not furnished at all

msg:It is not convenient to go out to Beijing recently, so the family decided to find a hotel for Staycation. Legendary wanted to come a long time ago, the appearance is good enough to pretend to be in Europe 😏

The interior space of the hotel is very spacious, and it can be seen that great efforts have been made in the details. It is luxurious but not vulgar, and it is a blockbuster to take a casual look.

The most old-fashioned hotel, the service details are still remarkable. When booking the room, it is noted that children are staying. The children's equipment and small gifts that should be in the room are well prepared, and the masks are prepared for children. Fruits are also prepared in the elevator room, which is rarely seen in hotels that have stayed in recent years.

The biggest advantage is the geographical location. I often bring children to Wangfujing. The Hamreis toy store, Pingguo Bureau, and Lego flagship store are all within walking distance. I have a very fulfilling weekend.

There is no turndown service, and the sockets in the room are external sockets! I also saw it for the first time! Really amazed! The wooden structure at the top of the house is rotten. Breakfast is not as good as a 4 star hotel. You and the chef of the restaurant said to be single-sided, and he will argue with you whether the prepared egg is single-sided or not!

There is afternoon tea in the afternoon after check-in that day, there are not many things, but the quality is not high, it is difficult to eat, the coffee is ok, the American style is not sour or bitter 👍
Dinner with friends is a take-out order, it's a pity that I didn't go downstairs to eat.
The breakfast on the second day was also less varied, with freshly cooked chicken noodle soup, wontons and hot vegetables.
Lunch is a buffet, Hainanese chicken rice is good👍 but each portion is relatively small
📷The main reason for choosing Legendale is to take pictures, and I did a lot of strategies in advance. After I came, I found that many red lanterns were newly hung in the hotel, which were ugly and did not match the overall style. I am disappointed. I hope the hotel economy can be based on Make New Year's Arrangements in Your Own Style!
The toiletries are all from L'Occitane 👍 The texture of the bathrobe is skin-friendly and soft 👍

msg:December in Beijing is getting colder❄️
The temperature suddenly dropped below freezing this week, so I decided to come to Legend Hotel for a staycation with my husband for Chris**as🎄
.
Location: The hotel is located on Jinbao Street in Wangfujing. The overall hotel style is Southern European style. Whether it is the exterior architecture, internal control design, or the meticulous craftsmanship inside the room, the design intentions are reflected.
.
Room: I chose a business suite this time. I contacted the hotel in advance to help me decorate it and sprinkle it with roses. The package booked on a certain journey includes three meals and afternoon tea. They are all buffet meals in the cafe on the second floor.
.
At Chris**as time, the two-story Chris**as tree in the lobby can be said to be one of the most a**ospheric places in Beijing. Last year I came here to have afternoon tea with friends, and this year I was very happy to come here with my husband for the weekend.
.
On Chris**as Eve, I also walked to the nearby Dongtang Church ⛪Although church activities are currently cancelled, many people still come 🎄

msg:For the room booked on Ctrip, when checking in, the front desk informed that there are only 3 floors left for occupancy on floors 3-13. Later, I learned that it was because the Ctrip platform booked the car and was treated. When I entered the room, I saw the peeling wall covering in the bathtub, so I contacted the duty. The manager was upgraded to a room on the 13th floor.
The buffet brunch dishes are pitiful and can be said to be the worst five-star. Especially for lunch, there is only one steamed fish, which is good, but the speed of replenishing the dishes is extremely slow. I only replenished it once in more than an hour, and I lost my appetite when I replenished it for the second time. Then the staff sent a bottle of red wine as compensation.

In conclusion, the 1-star service in the tourist attractions hotels of foreign tourists has no sense of experience.

The service at the front desk and restaurant was good. I booked a suite and the bathroom was upgraded. I think the bedding is very good and the bedding is very comfortable. Good value for money. I have a few questions. One is that I didn’t know until I arrived that the suite included three meals and afternoon tea. The reservation was not shown in the hotel and no one called to inform me, so I didn’t catch up with the Chris**as Eve dinner. However, the lunch buffet later was very average and there was no need to book a suite for the meal and additional parking. There is a single charge, but it seems that the 50% discount coupon is given during the holidays, which is okay. Finally, the bathroom and toilet are a bit cold. Now they are all electric. Old hotels should also consider keeping pace with the times. Otherwise, it will be so sad at night in winter. The flaws are not concealed. I will choose it next time.

🏨 Because of school restrictions, I couldn't go out of Beijing, and I wanted to bring my baby to play, so I stayed at the Legend Hotel for the first time after admiring my name for a long time. Because I saw that there are package activities including afternoon tea and breakfast and dinner, I quickly booked a weekend room. Surprise was upgraded to the executive floor!

🏨 When I arrived at the accommodation floor, I was sure to be shocked by the sight. The children couldn't help but exclaimed. The buildings are surrounded by a large space, and the hotel structure is really cool. After opening the room, there is a small living room, and then the bedroom is opened by opening the door. There is a super big bed and a super cute bear (you can take it home!) is very warm. The big bed is so comfortable😌.

🏊 Can’t wait to go swimming, like a swimming pool in a European castle, the water temperature should be around 29 degrees. Very comfortable, not many people, a lot of bath towels, there are also massage water stone beds, swimming with the baby for more than an hour, fun! There is also a fitness room and sauna next to it.

🇫🇷 Afternoon tea is in a French restaurant. The seemingly French manager will arrange a seat with the waiter. It really seems to be in Paris haha. If you can, try to choose a position by the window. You can see a historic courtyard house. It should be renovated and beautiful.

🏆 The whole hotel is really luxuriously designed, and there are many real antiques inside. Visiting the hotel is like visiting a museum. Frankly speaking, this kind of parent-child experience is really good. Arrive at the hotel at 2 o'clock in the afternoon, afternoon tea at 3 o'clock, swimming at 5 o'clock, dinner at 7 o'clock, and take pictures after dinner in the hotel. Sleep until nine o'clock the next day to eat a luxurious breakfast. I feel that time flies very fulfilling. It is a pity that the only authentic Macau restaurant in Beijing is no longer in operation. Regrettably.

🌈 A good parent-child accommodation activity.

Although the hotel is a few years old, the hotel is clean and tidy, the service is very attentive and meticulous, the bedding and bathrobe are very comfortable, the toiletries are still L’Occitane, and I have never found any problems after staying twice. I haven't encountered the bad phenomena in individual comments. This time I stayed in a business suite. The room is large, the layout is reasonable, and the price is very high. All three meals a day can be solved in the hotel. There is also afternoon tea. Although it is not particularly good, it is quite good compared to hotels of the same grade. The price is great!
Anyway, I am giving five-star praise! recommend!

A business suite was ordered, and it was upgraded to a larger room with double bathrooms. Business guests can go to the Bicui French restaurant to enjoy breakfast, lunch, dinner and afternoon tea. The service now has improved more than when I checked in a few years ago. I said hello, and I was asked several times if I am satisfied with the room facilities and whether there are any areas that need improvement. I went to sit on the terrace at night and poured water.

The shower went into the water quickly. The supporting facilities are complete, and there are even scissors in the room. The meals are self-service except for a main course of choice. And the price itself is not expensive. The first time I had afternoon tea in a French restaurant, the view of the courtyard outside the window was very interesting.

This time I went to the fitness center. The swimming pool is 1.2m deep, there are few people, and the water is not cold. The overall experience is extremely perfect.

The last time I came to work, I should have helped GQ or Esquire to write about their Jamez Portuguese cuisine restaurant, but this restaurant has never been open since the beginning of the epidemic. The true essence of Zhai Hotel lies in-nesting. Obviously, my daughter and I have a lot of fun. The trea**ent on the executive floor is a magical way to help you solve 4 meals a day, including three main meals and one afternoon tea.

In those years when I wanted to write about hotels, I lived alone in a hotel room and wrote in retreat. The intensive feeding of six meals a day on the executive floor couldn’t keep up. When I finished writing and sent it to the editor, I missed the last supper. He is still my favorite Hainan. The chicken rice was delivered in less than 30 minutes. Even now, I still think the most charming place in the hotel is always the Hainanese chicken rice from Room Service.

Legendale Hotel, the most Macau presence on Campbell Street. Whenever the weather is good, I will silently take a picture every time I come out of GYM. Speaking of it, it’s the first time I have lived in this room. After peeling off the magnificent shell, I found the elegance in my bones. The difference from the gold-rimmed mirror frame and the exaggerated interior is that every frame makes you feel Comfortable.

The daughter pointed to the chair in the French restaurant and said that it was similar to the century-old chair we saw in the Tsinghua Academy of Fine Arts. The most well-known chair design in Europe was found in the room. The collection scattered in the lobby does not show the style and heritage of Macau.

Needless to say, the environment can pretend to be in Europe from the outside to the inside. As soon as you enter the lobby, you will feel the right choice. The a**osphere is magnificent and the details can withstand scrutiny. The check-in efficiency at the front desk is very efficient, and the suite was accidentally upgraded. , A piece of paper clearly writes all the administrative benefits. According to the staff, not only the suite but also the ordinary room can also enjoy the executive lounge. Breakfast, lunch and dinner + afternoon tea are all included. , And it's a zero point rather than a self-service format, and the price is about 1,000 yuan. In this year when even the orange selection is 600+, it is so fragrant!
When I enter the room, I feel great value. I instantly recall the feeling of the four seasons in Paris. The space is even more spacious. It is especially praised for the free soft drinks in the small refrigerator, the temperature is cold enough, and the Twinings tea bag + Nespresso coffee machine. It is also a dead house weekend. A must-have. Staying for 24 hours, I tried the executive lounge afternoon tea and lunch, as well as the double yellow croaker dinner in the Chinese restaurant. The products were all remarkable. When I left the hotel, I was full of blood and resurrected. I was really happy!

msg:It’s impossible to go anywhere, staying at a hotel on weekends is an excellent way to bring a baby~ Legendale Hotel is located in Wangfujing, Beijing, which is very rich in land. The surrounding internet celebrity attractions are too convenient to play~Shape, color, material and texture are very important for design In terms of this, this kind of creative awakening to the senses of guests is called "feeling design". The hotel design style combines Chinese and Western styles, and the layered vision is too suitable for taking pictures. The large number of paintings in the hotel greatly enhance the artistic a**osphere, and the suite area is 150 square meters. Above, the holiday space has been opened up, and the mood has also opened up~

The Bicui French restaurant currently serves guests from the executive floor. The self-selected small menu has Chinese and Western, and the desserts are also excellent. The focus is on unlimited supply~ There are few people, the quiet service is good, the dishes are small and beautiful, and they are delicious without burden~

In Legend Hotel, you can travel through time at once, and when you turn around, you are already in a modern, concise, and comfortable space with Western colors. The Haojiangxuan Jiangnan Cuisine Chinese Restaurant, where Master Zhao Renliang is seated, is extraordinary. Su-style beef tendon, eel paste, Shanghai noodles with June yellow, dried shrimp with bamboo shoots, shrimp romaine lettuce, crab noodle dumplings, and pan-fried buns. . The productions advocating nature, pursuing seasonality and original taste, paying attention to the beauty of artistic conception, and full of tolerance.

msg:Exit the Dengshikou subway, and cross the road to the Legendale Hotel. The Versailles-style design is very stunning, with an illusion of being in Europe. The 17-story atrium design in the lobby is very fantastic and is a popular place to check in. The beauty and wealth here come from every detail and collection of treasures, such as crystal chandeliers, the only fireplace hall in Beijing, French gold mirrors, and Baroque decorations. After so many years, they are still exquisite and shiny. In addition, there is a small garden behind the hotel, which is really a paradise in the second ring road. It is very convenient to walk to Wangfujing, Art Museum, and Sanlian Bookstore.

Luckily, the staff helped us upgrade. The guest rooms are very comfortable, and the size and luxury of the executive suites cannot be replaced by the "fashionable design" of those new hotels. The suite is very spacious. The hotel has placed a comfortable bed for children under the outer window very intimately. The children voluntarily climbed up without crowding with us. Once the door is closed, there are two worlds. The coffee machine in the room, L’Occitane toiletries, soft carpet slippers are all available, and a pack of exquisite L’Occitane lipstick and hand cream is also given when turning the bed down. What moved me the most was that I thought that as an old hotel, there would be no usb sockets, but I found that all the sockets with usb were kindly offered.

The swimming pool located on the second floor must be praised. The shape and design are very luxurious, and it has the feeling of a Roman spa. The water in the pool is clean, the temperature is just right, there are not many people, and there are massage chairs in the pool. The staff at the swimming pool is very responsible. We let the child go into the water first, then turn around to put the towels. In two or three minutes, the staff reminds us to take good care of the child and don’t let him be alone in the water. In addition, if there is a little water on the ground, the staff will wipe it clean.

The Haojiangxuan Chinese Restaurant on the ba*****t floor is a pleasant surprise. It is said that the master of the state banquet, Zhao Renliang, is in charge of his Jiangnan cuisine. Some of my favorite dishes are stewed lion head, moray eel paste, dried mushroom and shrimp Taizhou tofu, iron stick yam, even if you don’t live in a hotel, you might as well come here for a small gathering. The stewed lion head is really delicious. It is said that the cooking process is very complicated and delicate, and the clear soup is oil-free, fragrant and not greasy. The eel paste is the best I've ever eaten, especially with rice. However, no matter how much you eat, you still have to leave room for a red noodle soup. Sometimes there is no place to eat at noon, so you can come and order one by yourself. It is delicious with a plate of yam and fennel beans. In addition, the iced crayfish in summer is also an extremist. After the season, the current drunken crabs can just be replaced. The "June Yellow" yellow is really full.

For breakfast in the French restaurant, there is a wide selection of Chinese and Western dishes and dim sum. Among them, I like wanton noodles and fried dough sticks the most.

The first reason for choosing his house is because the Haojiangxuan where Master Zhao Renliang sits is much more stable than XX Xiang! This time I just caught up with the edamame rice cakes, June Huang. This very authentic and Shanghai way can be eaten in Beijing and it really makes me happy as if I won the lottery! In addition, salted chicken, braised pork and crispy fish are also must-orders every time~
Let me talk about the second reason~ I was fascinated by the atrium here when I came here for dinner with friends. It looks very psychedelic and retro. In addition to the baroque style of the entire hotel, Vintage lovers must come and have it!
The overall service of the hotel is still in place, from the accessories to slippers to the room service, all the details that the long-lost veteran five-star hotel should have are considered, comparable to the St. Regis hotel in the SPG era.
Now the occupancy rate is not so high, the corridor empty courtyard is very suitable for various concave shapes to take pictures, remember to bring the beautiful painting of a small dress~
If I recommend the weekend Gap in the second ring road, I would really recommend them seriously and responsibly!

msg:Legendale Hotel is an old hotel in the Wangfujing area. The Portuguese-style design is very beautiful and magnificent. It is magnificent like a palace: antique furniture in public areas, antique crystal chandeliers in Baccarat, and the details are everywhere. Also because of this design, any shot is a blockbuster.

This time the room space and cost performance are very high. The basic daily necessities, toiletries, and mini bars are all great. The bathroom is not small, separate from wet and dry, bathtub and double sinks. The only flaw is that there is no washlet. Turning down the bed will also give the same brand as the accessories, L’Occitane hand cream and lip balm. In autumn, Beijing really needs these little moisturizers. The standard capsule coffee machine and mini bar in the room, soft drinks are free, and two coffee capsules are given at a time.

Located on Jinbao Street, there are all kinds of luxury car brands. It takes only five or six minutes to walk to Wangfujing Pedestrian Street. The surrounding area is full of food, drink and entertainment. The hotel’s Chinese and French food is superb, including puffer fish and cooked crayfish! Because of the epidemic situation, the breakfast is still a la carte. The taste is quite satisfactory. In short, the service is great.

In the Wangfujing area where competition is so large, Li Jun has been strong for so many years, showing its deep internal strength. If you come to Beijing to play by yourself, living here is an absolute value for the price/performance ratio.

msg:This time I took my family to Peking Union Medical College Hospital for review. I stayed at the Legendale Hotel on Jinbao Street in Beijing. It is very convenient to go to Union Hospital. It is within walking distance. I have been to the Fisherman’s Wharf and Legend Palace in Macau before. It is a strong French palace style, but it gives people a very high-end style, with the illusion of being in Macau. The entire atrium is completely hollowed out, whether it is shot upstairs or downstairs is very beautiful.

When I went back in the evening, I took a closer look at the display in the public area of the lobby. Many of them were ancient insights from the 19th century. There are many ancient Baccarat chandeliers in the hotel. There are a large number of Baroque reliefs and none of the walls are blank. It seems that hotels really hate money, hahahahaha.

When I checked in, I heard that it was a review. The hotel was very considerate to help me upgrade my room. To be honest, because it has been in business for more than ten years, there must be a sense of age, but it can also be seen that the hotel has worked hard to maintain it. However, I heard from the front desk that the hotel is preparing for room upgrades, and I hope that I will have the opportunity to stay in the next business trip.

The room’s accessories are L’Occitane’s, the turn-down gift is also L’Occitane’s hand cream and lipstick. The accessories add up to 200+.

In addition, I want to say in particular that because the breakfast crew was filming, the place was temporarily changed. The waiter was a little too busy to come, and the food was a little slow. However, the good thing was that when I checked out in the afternoon, I ran into Huang Xuan and Bai Baihe filming in the lobby. In particular, the Chinese restaurant on the first floor of the hotel, as the Huaiyang cuisine certified by Nanjing’s real-name system, is very authentic. It's even more cost-effective if you buy it in groups.

msg:Legendale Hotel, whether in Wangfujing area or Beijing city, is a special place. If you want to find a hotel in the city that is completely different from other hotels, or even leave the domestic European style for a while, Legendale Hotel can give you a completely different experience. Refreshing.
The journey starts from the moment of looking at the exterior of the hotel. The buildings like the Palace of Versailles built by Mr. Li have different responses from the outside to the inside. Walking into the lobby, the vertical 17-story high-rise space, looking up, really has a palace-like design style. The lobby is formally entered into a palace (it is exactly the same as the temperament of the second ring of the capital). With crystal chandeliers, the only fireplace hall in Beijing, French gold-inlaid mirrors and Baroque sculpture decorations, and marble and granite floors, the line of sight will involuntarily be missed by the French or Portuguese chairs in the lobby bar. Extraordinary style.

On the right hand side of the main entrance, behind the floral arrangement is the front desk, which gives the residents a good degree of privacy. Check-in was quick, and the room was easily reached by a 6-step elevator. This time I stayed in a suite. There are also many painting decorations in the stairwell. Baroque reliefs and chandeliers create a foreign holiday style.

Pushing open the door, the overall tone is white and beige with a light tone, the hallway in, the living room, floor lamps, and behind the bookcases are the beautiful scenery of the third ring and the second ring, and the line of sight is far away. The bedroom and ensuite bathroom are very good, and the privacy is also relevant. The marble floor, L’Occitane's spare parts, and the double-basin countertops have been kept in good quality for so many years. The bedding is comfortable and the softness is just right. My favorite is that the door is ajar, which can reveal the dim light and shadow of the lamp just opposite. The sound insulation effect is also very good, and the quality of sleep is guaranteed.

Welcome fruits and chocolates are all available, and the minibar is also a newer refrigerator like. There is sweet honey on the coffee machine. The color of the overall suite is blue and white, and the color is also reminiscent of the elegance of European royal families.
Breakfast is in the coffee shop, egg rolls and chicken noodle soup are good, and the coffee is also good. There are not many people on weekends. The most recommended is the scenic swimming pool, 25 meters in standard, with Baroque oil paintings inlaid on both sides, and the swimming pool is full of style.

By the way, the Chinese restaurant on the B1 floor is also the highlight of this time! Unexpectedly, there is a treasure Huaiyang restaurant hidden here. I tried the yellow croaker set meal that is in the promotion season, including yellow croaker pasta, yellow croaker soup, fried yellow croaker with ginger slices, peach kernel tomato, and my favorite fried fish fillet. The last dessert was sweet-scented sweet-scented osmanthus taro seedlings that I haven't eaten for a long time. The overall style is very similar to those characteristic hotels in Macau, such as Wynn Palace.

Holiday in the city, feel Macau or European style, Legendale Hotel is really special in this city.

🔔Service: Room service will not disturb guests. The gym will also take the initiative to ask the guests if they want to take pictures, and the front hall of the restaurant is well-trained.

msg:Leading’s check-in experience can be said to be quite good 👍🏻 From the front desk clerk to check in, the whole service is very in place, and the room also sent welcome fruits and chocolate desserts very intimately. The suite price includes breakfast ➕ lunch ➕ afternoon tea ➕ dinner for two persons. This is an excellent price-performance ratio! The combination of Chinese and Western food for breakfast especially satisfies my difficulty in choosing 🤣, and the dinner set menu is also quite rich. The seafood stir-fried pho is a must. My friend and I even ordered two of them... The full set of care products are L’Occitane's verbena series, which tastes fresh and healing. The soundproofing of the room is very good, and the mattress is not too comfortable. I usually have a low quality of sleep, but I can have a deep sleep in this hotel... The decoration style is also my favorite. When I wake up, there is a kind of "I am the sleeping beauty in the castle." "The feeling 😝 hahahahahaha!

msg:Recently, the house that has been put on hold for 9 months is ready to start decoration. It is like looking around and learning from the styles of various hotels. Before, before the epidemic, I had been to Leading and I thought it was Bling, so I liked it. , I will come over with my husband this time. I especially like the porch where the room enters. It looks good and feels full of ritual.
The biggest impression of Leading is that the service is good. Every service staff is very attentive, neither more nor less, everything is just right, which makes people feel very comfortable. This time I was particularly impressed by the blonde girl in the French restaurant on the 2nd floor. I feel like he should be a restaurant leader. Although he is a foreigner, his Chinese is very good, and his service consciousness is also very strong, impeccable.
When checking in, the staff enthusiastically recommended the yellow croaker set meal, but my husband and I had eaten it, and we said, looking forward to other things, and then the staff introduced the French restaurant set meal, which was very thoughtful; when we checked out, there was also the customer manager Inquired about the feeling of staying in, I told the truth, um, the room is a bit old, but the service is good, he smiled shyly.
Frankly speaking, I am not a person who likes to write reviews, because I am busy at work, and because there is nothing to write about in the ordinary, I will write only when it is particularly good and bad. Because it feels worthwhile, Li Jun will give me The feelings are very good, especially the service, the black garlic soup is also delicious, hahaha, after drinking 2 cups, I look forward to seeing my review friends to taste it, it is worthwhile to visit

msg:The hotel is close to the downtown area of Wangfujing, between a red-walled old Beijing courtyard, full of Parisian retro style and unique flavor.

Standing by the window of the hotel, you can look at Xishan from a distance, and overlook the Forbidden City and Lama Temple. Under the blue sky, crowded with pedestrians and vehicles, but not a trace of the bustle of the city.

The hotel’s service is attentive, especially during the epidemic period, it specially hired a professional company to carry out the full disinfection of the whole area and the air conditioning and fresh air system. You can also get a bottle of "chlorine baby" for disinfection at any time when you stay. Disposable masks are also available in the lobby for emergencies.

The bedding, towels, and supplies are all internationally renowned brands and are very comfortable to use.

The food surprises in the hotel are endless. Afternoon tea with courtyard landscape, you can eat cake while looking at the daily life of the folk houses in the old Beijing courtyard.

The yellow croaker set meal, almost every dish, is made of deep-sea small yellow croaker. The yellow croaker has a delicate taste and is even more delicious after the chef's interpretation.

msg:This is a five-star hotel located on Jinbao Street, at the intersection of the ancient city and the modern city.

As far as I can see, the European theater-style box design, the 17-storey atrium, row upon row, you can see the ceiling directly. The luxurious lobby displays a priceless fireplace, carved with a statue of "Bloody Mary", a rare 300-year-old clock passed down from the time of Louis XIV... It’s so moat, the style of the Bourbon dynasty, on the banks of the Seine The style is worthy of being the most Parisian boundary under the imperial city roots.

The corridor of the floor is designed as a theater box. There will be elevator signs every some distance. To enter the elevator, you need to insert the card first and then press the arrival floor. The room card can go to the first and second floors. You can only swipe this floor. Invalid guest room floor. The hotel has 6 elevators for guests to use, and each elevator is equipped with a disabled button, which is also one of the detailed indicators of a five-star hotel.

Each of the guest rooms and suites has complex and gorgeous decorations, full of charming style. The Baroque style is presented in noble yellow and royal blue as the main tones, and the marble-covered bathroom is more luxurious in the hotel.

The "Haojiangxuan" named after Guangdong Haojiang is arranged on the B1 floor, with golden yellow traditional Chinese patterns all over all corners. The base color of Chinese red and mahogany furniture all highlight its pure Chinese characteristics. The lofty dome and recessed lighting in the lobby bring a sense of open space, and the most unique one is the dome structure in the private room with the "Ching Ming Shang River" painted.

"Haojiangxuan" is managed by the national treasure-level culinary master, state banquet master, and Zhao Renliang.

In addition to the delicious and delicious aged Huadiao crayfish, you can also eat many classic dishes of Master Zhao here. I really love the fennel beans with a side dish, and the surf puffer fish I saw and ate for the first time. There are also stewed lion's head, eel paste, Xiaoshan radish dried peony shrimp balls, fried Zhoushan large yellow croaker with rice cake and so on. It's so delicious and so enjoyable.

msg:As a person who does not add to the chaos of the country, choosing a good hotel in the city is also a particularly good choice, so I took my mother and left for "24 hours of leisure in Legend Hotel". Generally speaking, there is no problem. We had a total of three meals + afternoon tea in the hotel. The most impressive thing is the hotel's Chinese restaurant, which is really amazing. And the price is very reasonable, it is hard to imagine a famous chef who tastes very good but the price is very close to the people. Mom said that she likes this one the most in Beijing.

🚗 Transportation: It is very convenient whether it is a taxi, subway or bus. Dengshikou Station of Metro Line 5 is just 200 meters away. It is easy to find even if you come to Beijing from other places.


🧹Sanitation: The environmental sanitation of five-star hotels has always been impeccable. The armrests in the corridors are not stained, not to mention the linen in the rooms.


🍃Environment: There are interior buildings of the hotel where internet celebrities can take photos, and antique-level furnishings. Anyone who takes photos is a blockbuster of internet celebrities.


🔔Service: Whether it is the kindness of room service or the good service of the restaurant. Even the waiters you meet casually in the hotel will greet you enthusiastically. The service is in place and there is absolutely no choice.

msg:I couldn't get out of Beijing recently, so I chose a staycation hotel. I witnessed the opening of Legendale Hotel when I was working on Jinbao Street more than ten years ago. It was 13 years later! This is too fast...

🛏 I booked more than 900 basic room types, but I was unexpectedly upgraded when I checked in! It feels great value! ! The epidemic prevention measures are also quite strict.

The room is a very beautiful small suite, the same as the appearance of the hotel, it is European classicism style, and it has the illusion of being in Europe. To the north, you can see layers of distant mountains, the scenery is unparalleled! The living room, rest area and bathroom area are partitioned according to their functions, and the movement lines are very well designed. The L’Occitane verbena bath series is provided, which is also of high quality. The bedding is simply too good! It looks soft but has great support. When you wake up, you won't feel back pain or fatigue. There are several choices for pillows and quilts. The level of hygiene is also very high.

🍽 One more special thing is the all-inclusive meal for morning, lunch and evening + afternoon tea. It seems this is the first time I have encountered this kind of courtesy after staying in so many hotels. But because I ate too much at the Haojiangxuan Jiangnan cuisine Chinese restaurant in the hotel B1 at noon (strongly recommend the big yellow croaker set meal!!), I just tasted the breakfast and didn’t have the chance to eat it~ By the way, it was prepared in the room Rich fruits and desserts, so sweet~~

🏊‍♀️ The hotel’s fitness facilities are also very complete. Especially the swimming pool, because the water is very clean after just changed. Swimming is too enjoyable when there is no one~ The lifeguard brother is also very warm, friendly and responsible.

📷 Whether it is in the room, corridor or lobby, it is especially suitable for taking pictures! I especially like the splendid corridors, the geometric elements are particularly magnificent!

🚇 The location of the hotel is even more so, guarding the junction of Jinbao Street, it is only a few minutes walk from Dengshikou Station of Line 5, and it takes about 10 minutes to Wangfujing. However, I recommend two walking routes, one is to go straight to Donghuamen after passing Wangfujing, and then walk a big circle around the Forbidden City, pass through the moat and the Meridian Gate. If you are lucky, you can also meet the national flag guard of honor after the flag-lowering ceremony. . The other is to walk north from the hotel to Dongsi. The Street of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Shijia Hutong, and Lao She’s Former Residence are all worth a visit.

msg:The summer vacation is coming to an end. I can’t go out in Beijing during the special period. I also want to take the children to relax. I thought of the Legendale Hotel on Jinbao Street. I can’t travel abroad and just pretend to be in Europe. I will definitely give the children a surprise. They will like the style of Lijun Southern Europe💁.
Catch up with the package launched by the hotel. It’s great value. It includes one night’s accommodation, administrative privileges (four meals a day, afternoon tea) for just over 1,000. Fitness, swimming pool, and sauna are all free. Book now~
 🍃Environment: I like it so much. European style classicism will make people really feel like being in a European castle. There are scenes everywhere, and one shot is a blockbuster. The classical layout and elegant style, exquisite carvings, classical furniture, and unique ceiling design in the room make the whole room distinct and full of space.
Dinning room:
The restaurant design here is also full of beauty, showing luxury and romance everywhere. For dinner, we went to the Chinese restaurant and had a yellow croaker feast. The dishes were exquisite, delicious and nutritious, and the children liked it very much. Dining in French restaurants at other times, the administrative courtesy is very good, you can eat at any time~
🔔Service: Since parking at the door of the hotel, I felt their meticulousness and thoughtfulness. I feel that the service of a five-star hotel here is completely full score ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.
🚗 Transportation: You can see the Forbidden City in the room, the absolute center. It is super convenient to Wangfujing Pedestrian Street and Tiananmen Square.

The hotel has carefully arranged the rooms and delivered fruit plates, French pastries and roses, warm and romantic! The suite is about 70 square meters, elegant in style, spacious and comfortable, clean and hygienic. Both the bed and the desk are equipped with USB charging sockets, which are convenient for residents to use their mobile phones. Afternoon tea and breakfast, lunch and dinner are all in the Bicui French restaurant on the second floor, with an elegant dining environment. For breakfast, lunch and dinner, there are Chinese and Western dishes and staples to choose from, as well as juice, milk, coffee, and various wines for dinner. The dishes are delicious and the ingredients are fresh! From the lobby reception, front desk, room service to the restaurant, all depar**ents of the hotel are active and warm, thoughtful and considerate! 👍Recommended!

🍃Environment: Li Chun has always been very popular. European style classicism will make people really feel like being in a European castle.

msg:Beijing | French style close at hand

The dignified and elegant 19th-century Paris style can be seen everywhere, with French courtyard-style gardens and historic courtyards within easy reach. Chinese and Western cultures blend together. This is not Europe, but the Legend Hotel in Beijing’s Financial Street.

The extremely magnificent French design style, classical furniture, unique ceiling, from the lobby, corridor, restaurant, to the room, the magnificent and elegant temperament, it seems to be back to France in an instant.

The location is great! Wangfujing is just a few steps away, and it is very convenient to go to the Forbidden City, Qianmen and Dongdan. In the Legend Hotel Haojiangxuan Chinese Restaurant and Bicui French Restaurant, the food is too gluttonous, and it is very suitable for strolling around after the meal.

msg:The hotels I have loved since I was young, I looked at the construction of middle school and high school, and now I can work hard to earn money to live in it. This feeling will definitely add points to my heart. There are so many five-star hotels in Beijing, only Legend has such gorgeous decoration, retro and dreamy.

The years of the hotel have accumulated, and the facilities are well maintained. The room accessories are L’Occitane verbena series, and the overall service is maintained very nice. If you live on a high floor, looking down or up in the hotel lobby is really shocking.

Fortunately, the room type has been upgraded. The trea**ent on the executive floor is really invincible. It includes four meals a day, from breakfast to afternoon tea to dinner. The price/performance ratio is the best in Wangfujing. Those who come to Beijing can really book it here, they can sleep well and eat well, the price is right and the location has nothing to say.

The French furniture is very old, and the bent places are full of dust. Rosewood, New International Trade, Eclat, Pan Pacific, the lower prices are many times better than Legendary. In short, it is quite disappointing, and the service attitude is even more difficult to describe. In short, if you pay, it is not the case. The taste of the restaurant's meal is even more shocking. I only ate one meal in the restaurant on the second floor delivered by the executive suite, and the taste was too shocking. I won't live again in this life

服務：中規中矩，反正挺冷漠的吧，沒有被服務的體貼之感。而且門口的工作人員會到一層大廳大喊大叫，出門的時候剛好碰到，驚呆……

        有的顧客留言覺得裝修陳舊，開業15年啦！蓋好和裝修好，最少也要2年，17年前人的眼光，現在拍片都不不遜，當年開業時，得多輝煌呀！裝修採用的羅馬柱、描金呀，這在17年前是很高端的裝修了，歐式建築風格和咱們的中式建築風格一樣，沒有過時這一説。國外的百年老店，也是有的，經過了歲月的打磨，才會有更多的味道。
        服務嗎？前台的王緋緋小妹妹，從接待我到最後手續辦完，服務和態度都很好，因為酒店房間一般都要下午2點左右才能打掃出來，把行李寄存禮賓部，去附近的方磚廠69號雜醬麪吃了午飯，又溜達着回來，等到兩點，有了空房間，王緋緋看帶着長者和孩子，免費升級了個大房間，但是不是朝陽的，叫我先去房間看看，如果不滿意，一定要朝陽的房間，那在這個房間裏等一下，衞生打掃好了，再去調換。進了房間一看，全家都滿意，也就沒有再換。地毯挺乾淨呀！沒有説的異味啥的，我們家之前鋪過地毯，來這麼多客人，地毯還能這麼乾淨，説明打掃衞生的員工，能努力啦！
        門衞也很熱情，及時幫你拉行李箱，有一個小夥子，很好的，但是沒看他的名字，很抱歉，下次去酒店時，一定看好你的名字。傑克是酒店唯一的外籍員工，意大利籍，中文很好，女兒和他玩的很開心。
        酒店離5號線燈市口站，很近很近。北京南站打車30多元。酒店路口有個小館子特別好吃，“粵小館”你要是住在酒店，一定去試一試，真的好吃呀！

畢竟是老牌酒店服務真是沒話説：門口工作人員熱情積極老遠就幫我們拿行李；保潔阿姨手腳麻利看見她們路過走廊時都是跑起來的；前廳工作人員總是很耐心解答問題得體又誠懇，早餐種類豐富咖啡很贊。
離王府井很近，走路幾分鐘。
樓下租個共享單車騎行去長安街路過天安門10-15分鐘。
已經坐上回寧波的動車，沒有留意我老公手機落在酒店。酒店值班經理打來電話，快速溝通並處理好。

一次愉快的旅行和住宿😊。

2.禮賓部不會主動幫忙拿行李。就站在哪裡聊天，哪怕看到我是一個女生自己拎着行李箱都沒有過來幫忙。
3.早餐一般，鮮榨果汁都沒有，作為五星級酒店來説很糟糕了，不如對面麗晶
3.房間其實有點舊和臟，浴缸不知道多久沒擦了，還有黑印，不過我回去很晚了就沒反饋這個問題，本來打算續住，結果完全住不下去了
4.衣架什麼的全都掉漆了，我的手機不小心掉在後麪的縫裡，拿手電筒一照，床靠背下面全都是臟的，甚至還有不知道哪一位客人扔進去的紙巾
作為一個五星級酒店，質量真的堪憂
5.還是服務態度，和酒店工作人員問路就好像求他們辦事一樣，還是愛搭不理，我想着兩千六一晚也不便宜吧，至少服務態度要在的吧。想多拿一張房卡和我説一個人衹能一張，不是我説，我就不能留個備用嗎，我是能偷你卡還是什麼？其次，我住過很多全世界各地的酒店，本身也是學這個專業，所以這家酒店的糟糕真的是超出了我的預計。衝著好看來的話拍個照得了，沒必要住了。
ps：那些水垢是能擦掉的，懶得擦和擦不掉是兩種概念

msg:整體來看酒店是五星水平，外建築和內部裝修是有美感的，聖誕樹以及聖誕佈置在我入住的時候已經佈置好很漂亮

環境：不錯的整體環境，大堂環境，以及洗手間環境，但是四分的原因在於房間內有些暗無法調亮，而且我入住房間有一些壓抑，可能衹是這個房間的問題

服務：酒店的禮賓非常好，幫忙搬行李而且主動熱情的將行李送至房間門口，符合五星酒店的定位；酒店的門很重會有員工專門幫忙開門很不錯；唯一值得改進的是前台服務人員，辦理入住時全程非常冷漠甚至語氣有點兇，沒有打招呼，我希望2點退房但是告知我酒店不允許，在我表明原因後勉強同意改成一點半前退房

設施：大廳的天花板非常有美感，設施不錯

衞生：衞生間很寬敞，房間整體很乾凈

一次性用品是歐舒丹的，質量不錯。
衞生看起來還可以，但不是朝南向的房間味道奇怪，有類似發黴的味道。
設施有些陳舊，還在接受範圍內。
服務方面有很多槽點了，第一住的人很多，辦理入住的時候需要排隊等的時間略久，前台在酒店最裡麪。第二點外賣的話需要自取，一般放在酒店門外的快遞架子上。第三我們早上九點到酒店辦理入住，要求朝陽的房間，前台的一位女服務員説辦不了，衹能下午兩點以後辦理入住，並告訴我們可以選朝陽的並鎖定房間。等我們兩點辦入住發現給我們一間朝西的房間，排隊換房等候的時候發現前面的人入住價格更低，不曉得酒店定價是怎麼在四個小時的時間內有價格波動。後續是前台另一位男服務員幫忙改了房間，並且按照實時低價收費。
總體上來講，酒店地理位置優越，房間環境、設備、衞生還可以，服務有待加強。

位置及設施：故宮、天安門都離得近，地鐵口就在對面，去天壇也是幾站地鐵的事，方便沒的説！設計方面目前還沒有體驗過比這家更棒的，環形大樓，私隱、體驗都很棒，網上説有點老，我個人覺得有底藴，不管是有些斑駁的外牆裝飾物，還是老式的傢俱物件，除了好用還有一種沉靜的踏實。畢竟二十多年了，歲月的痕跡正好彌補了現代的喧囂。
衞生及服務：整個體驗最讓我滿意的服務就是保潔服務，響應迅速，服務到位，態度友好，比前台還要更舒心。尊貴會包含三餐一點，都是簡餐，味道一般，西餐口味強過中餐。餐廳服務人員還有一些年紀大的，老員工很沉穩，做事比年輕人有經驗，沉澱出的感覺讓我聯想到古堡裏的大管家，很特別。酒店沒有一味追求年輕化的東西，這才是有歷史有味道的酒店！前台的辦事效率稍微有點慢，但是過節人多也可以理解，服務的周到性建議再提高，退房的時候特意問了前台，才給了尋寶遊戲卡，也不枉我提前給孩子簡介酒店了。
整體評價：非常值得體驗的酒店。健身房和泳池特別不錯！適合帶孩子來放鬆休閑。下次來北京，應該是還要再來的！

msg:當天和先生領完結婚證，是我們的第一個紀念日，看小紅書介紹選擇了勵駿。
前台給的3樓的靠邊的一個房間，面積不大。幾乎沒有風景。房間裏兩側的窗户都是上鎖的，通風極差，房裡滿是黴味，門鎖是不好用的，小力氣女性名根本擰不動。開窗需要聯繫客房服務，由於我和先生是晚上辦理的入住，沒有再喊服務員。中央空調的暖風是壞的，衹有冷風出來，越開越冷，於是終於明白了為什麼房間裏有一台油汀電暖氣。歐式建築的牆上插孔是歐標的，電暖氣不能用。床頭配備的外接插孔電容問題，插電暖氣會跳電。因此衹能插到遠離床的桌邊。屋裡還是不暖。床單打掃地不是很乾凈，能夠感到床單上有細小的雜物。
房間裏有夜燈的設定是比較貼心的，不巧我先生對光很敏感，沒有找到關閉夜燈的開關，一直不能入睡，衹能後來拔了取電卡。
整體體驗不好。如果運氣好，也許會有好的房間吧。

制式化帶的服務 有禮無貌 完全沒有一絲微笑歡迎的感覺
反而是一種傲慢之感
確定入住每個客人入住的天數和入住價格都被前台女生大聲朗誦出來
不知道這個是不是酒店要求
但是對於私隱而言
感覺是有點沒禮貌 
再加上每個人入住價格不一樣
也會讓客人覺得不舒服吧 
關於看網絡上説設備老舊
個人覺得15年酒店維護這樣還能接受
但是衹是仔細看就還是經不起推敲
淋浴頭的水溝比較嚴重
其他部門的服務是反轉
跟前台人員冰冷的“禮貌”完全不一樣

給五顆星是因為總體的感覺還是不錯的，每天房間打掃的很乾凈，外賣要自己下去拿。
唯一很麻煩的是訪客登記要帶身份證，電子身份證還不行，這個很不方便，希望改進一下。

離王府井大街很近，步行5分鐘吧。離地鐵站更近，步行2,3分鐘吧。
房價比周邊經濟型酒店高不了多少，可是那種尊貴感真是天差地別。

1.勵駿的客房服務依然在線，沒有因為快過節人多而降低服務質量。
2.現在自助餐形式的套餐比之前的固定餐單更實用，選擇性更多。
3.西點質量尤其是蛋糕製作口感和水平明顯提升。
缺點:
餐飲部的人員情緒可能出現了一些問題，住了一週，發現每天都會出現一些小狀況，畢竟酒店的套餐形式註定餐飲部的人員是接觸顧客最多的部門，帶着情緒的上崗還是會影響酒店的整體形象的。

我是6號辦的入住，住6/7/8三個晚上，9號離店

6號到酒店，要求加一床被子，服務員被子拿過來沒有套被罩就給我

8號沒有安排房間打掃，我8號的行程是環球影城，一整天走了3萬步，回到房間23:00左右了，發現沒打掃，垃圾沒倒，洗漱用品沒補，浴巾毛巾沒更換，真的很崩潰，馬上打了前台電話，過了很久也沒有回覆我什麼原因！我又打電話過去，過了一會兒值班經理打電話給我，瞭解了一下情況，説我的房間無早，送早餐作為補償，我拒絕了，因為都沒有告訴我任何原因，我也不是突然續住，接近2000一晚的酒店，這是重大失誤！

後面也沒有任何後續，更沒有任何補償，我想我下次不會再住了，畢竟這個價位的酒店比比皆是！

一家酒店的硬件設施固然重要，但酒店文化，人文關懷才是留住顧客的長遠發展，希望你們下次碰到這類問題的時候不是像這次草草了事！

1.設施：08年的酒店，老舊就不多説了，但比想象的還老。床頭插座衹有一邊，客房電話古董了，門、牆開裂破損不描述了。和璞瑄沒法比。
2.服務：門僮看着我下行李，下完反應過來了。3間裏的1間，房卡第二天就刷不進了。餐廳登記動作太慢，還給插隊的人先登記，抗議了下居然讓我好好排隊，頓時火上心頭。總體服務不熱情，差錯還較多，相較於璞瑄一堆人圍着你服務，差錯後的各種致歉彌補，勵駿是要做功課了。
3.餐食：尊貴會自帶餐食，也是一言難盡，還不如不帶。中餐確實是“簡”餐，晚餐稍微不簡一點，總體質量不行，數量還不過關。人家璞瑄至少質量好，餐廳服務更是沒話説。
4.網紅：唯一值得説道的也就是中庭的設計了，不過住酒店主要還是享受住的過程，光靠這個怕是活不久的。

唯一美中不足，馬桶沒有緩沖蓋，掉下來嚇一跳。沒有智能馬桶蓋，坐上去冰涼，這個年代了，這個級別的酒店，還是套房，整個智能馬桶蓋沒多難吧。中國特色吧，對於體驗感的體貼服務還是差強人意。希望改善。

設施：部分設施有些陳舊老化（門禁刷卡器外殼容易掉），馬桶和浴缸沒有提供一次性塑料套，最主要沒有紙抽。

衞生：打掃還是挺乾淨的，除了走廊地毯。
環境：還是很適合打卡拍照的，法式風格很經典。

酒店停車半價，一天80左右。
早餐種類少一點，味道一般。
酒店裝修風格有特點，到處都是金色，酒店還有孩子尋寶任務，不少網紅來打卡。
酒店的床很舒服，屋內也非常安靜，酒店大堂服務人員都很好，也很主動。
總體感覺勵駿酒店不錯，以後安排客户，朋友也可以選擇此處。

msg:本來沒有做評論的習慣，今天特意在住完半個多月之後又回來評論，是因為這次來北京住了同級別的另一家酒店，真的感覺到了差距，厲駿的服務真心不錯，遇到的每個員工都很熱情，看到我有帶孩子會幫我免費升級房間並教給我怎樣訂房更合適，中途孩子發燒還會幫忙拿外賣和葯，房間很寬敞，現在很少有那種大房間了，網紅建築拍照也好看，就是要吐槽一下早餐，希望能提升一下，如果不是因為早餐原因本來這次來北京還想繼續訂厲駿的。

但是，離譜的是我辦入住時候，交按金刷卡機的收款方是某房地產公司，然後就被銀行一通調查。説我違規用卡了！然後提醒我以後不要再去類似機構刷信用卡消費。
攜程可否對合作商有個基本監管呀？否則攜程訂房風險太大了吧？

再來説説不足：泳池不是很大，因為對外所以有時人比較多比較雜；最不理解的是餐食，自助餐180左右一人，可是真的不是很好吃，選擇的種類很少，主餐也就是4個選一個，味道也很一般，尤其是下午茶，除了甜就是甜，對於五星的酒店來説做成這種味道有些不太理解。個人覺得完全可以訂外賣，又便宜又有的選擇。
有機會還會入住，但是肯定不會訂餐了

但兩個人在一起十年了 儀式感還是要有的
臨時打開app 發現勵駿酒店本日房價
72平米的套房包含四餐行政待遇 僅需1xxx
	
幾年前入住過一次，如今開業十多年的勵駿酒店
依然算是王府井周邊的地標建築，豪華的歐式風格
金碧輝煌的裝飾 全部透露着奢華
	
酒店維護的比我想象中好，房間還挺乾淨
	
雖然這個價格包含雙人下午茶，晚餐，第二天的早餐，午餐，但是體驗感其實並不好

因為情人節 套餐內的用餐地點本來是在二層的法餐廳，結果臨時更改到了咖啡廳，餐食有點一言難盡！
尤其是下午茶以及早餐真的很糟糕，可以用簡陋形容

晚餐的漢堡以及酒水還可以，第二天的午餐可選的主菜裏黃魚還可以。

1500這個價格 在王府井這個黃金地段 72平米的套房
其實性價比還可以啦，但餐飲方面真的要加強

早餐一般，陪品類少，雙面煎蛋是做好的，品相差了一些。

酒店絕對網紅款，無論外觀，大堂，還是房間觀景，景緻都是無敵的存在，看到好多小姐姐穿着靚麗的服裝打卡拍照。

推薦14層往上的行政層，尤其是東南方向的，看國貿大褲衩中國尊實在好的不要不要的，早起可看日出，晚上可觀夜景，咖啡小酒一整，氛圍感拉滿哈哈哈。

另外，酒店的服務很不錯，彌補了餐品口味一般的弱點，非常值得推薦哈😄

商務套房包四餐這個價格真是性價比極高。除了早餐勉強算是普通三四星酒店的水平，午餐和晚餐水平蠻出乎意料的，廚師水平真的不錯。下午茶就是普通出品。
法餐廳的服務人員感覺沒有受過標準化的培訓，尤其是溝通方式。一進門的，一位男服務員沖我吼着（聲音較大）説“你不知道明天自助餐啊？”我當時一愣，後來得知他是好意提醒我明天午餐會更豐盛，但是我因為孩子原因午餐提前一天吃了。這樣的溝通方式會引起誤會。
可能因為酒店的建築風格原因，顯得服務人員比較少，很空曠。前台和大堂的服務人員都非常好，儘量滿足需求的同時,令人如沐春風。
雖然風格更適合情侶出行，但是萌寶尋寶在酒店裡麪找古董的活動很有意思。推薦。

🧹衞生：很好，五星級酒店標準，房間稍舊但是很貼心，還有除菌加濕器，除菌噴手液，等非常細心的物品

🍃環境：歐式城堡，安靜，人少，很舒適

🔔服務：服務員也不見得多熱情，但是該做的都會做，感覺是一羣訓練有素的老北京職業服務員，沒有南方人那種假客氣，跟你説的都是很實在的，作為北京人，住着倒挺親切，法餐廳還有外籍服務員，也是訓練有素，中文很好。

總得開始一價全包1300多一晚的套房，在王府井這地界，還圖啥真的，很超值了

😭😭😭唯一遺憾是帶小朋友並沒有收到其他人的驚喜
而且過年前兩天去感覺有點冷清，並沒有很熱鬧，無論是人氣，還是裝扮

msg:單位不讓出京，臨時決定住勵駿酒店，尋找一下度假的感覺。去之前看了一些評價，發現這家酒店被升級房型的概率非常大，説明服務很好，正如我所料，預訂的尊貴會豪華雙床房，被前台最帥的小夥子升級成了套房😄😄😄。
尊貴會包含下午茶和三餐，下午茶稍簡陋了一些，衹有紅茶咖啡和三種果汁，是套餐形式，每桌都一樣。吃完下午茶後回房間出現了一個小插曲，我先生的腳撞到門框上，流了很多血，打電話要了創口貼，工作人員很快送來，後來我老公踩房間的椅子檢查傷口的時候突然被紮了一下，仔細一看，椅子表面藏着一根針，縫衣服那種，針別朝上，所以沒出什麼危險，我馬上打給客服，很快有工作人員前來，告知情況後急忙道歉，還送來了水和果盤，在我們吃過晚飯回房間後接到酒店工作人員的電話，表示歉意，我們也能理解，因為酒店房間提供針線包，保不齊是有心的或是孩子無心的，酒店的態度令我們非常滿意，還承諾減免孩子三餐的費用（尊貴會衹含有兩位成人的費用），因為我頭髮很長，打電話想要多一份護髮產品，客服送來了整套備品（酒店備品是歐舒丹馬鞭草系列）。房間裏的mini bar有四罐汽水是免費的，我們住的十五層電梯口有一大盤的新鮮蘋果🍎，可自行拿取，三餐均為自助，味道有好有壞，因個人口味不同，感受不同，甜品非常好吃，晚餐提供各種酒，其他時間沒有。
        退房非常快的，還卡詢問是否有其他消費，答沒有就直接退房成功。整體來説是一次非常愉快的住宿體驗，服務完全是五星級的體驗。

msg:辦入住的時候被酒店升房了！！！這和坐飛機被升艙是一樣的興奮啊！！！一家三口就這麼體驗了72平米的商務套房～ 入住體驗很好，房間裏的設施和酒店服務都很貼心。游泳池不錯，水温也舒服，老婆孩子很喜歡。就是健身房力量區器械有點少。推薦法餐廳午餐的羊腿，肉爛量足。想吃中餐的可以去他們B1的濠江軒中餐廳，現在吃黃魚和螃蟹最時令。生煎包一定要嚐嚐，太好吃！！竟然有麪包口感！！酒店離王府井很近，去哪裡溜達都挺方便的。

msg:很臨時的決定了這次十一錯峯的北京之行 選擇了勵駿果然是性價比之王 地處王府井 5分鐘即可步行至地鐵5號線 出行絕對方便 距離故宮天安門也不遠 

酒店設計的確有些浮誇風，非常富麗堂皇，全都是金燦燦的設計，畢竟有些年頭了，設施也有點舊不過洗漱用品都還是歐舒丹的呢 

服務上不管是前台，禮賓部或者是門口的保安大爺也都非常客氣和主動，讓人很舒服。

       我本人在離貴酒店不遠處工作，家也住附近，疫情已開因為工作性質無法出京，基本每週都在附近酒店帶孩子游泳及家庭休閑，多次入住半島酒店、華爾道夫、東方君悦等附近的五星級酒店，因為貴酒店一直以來屬於“網紅級別”，我考慮到人流較大及前些日子的某些特殊事件，我一直未預訂貴酒店，此次預訂也就是我第一次入住，總體感覺非常好，而且，經過我橫向比較，應該是我以後會多次預訂的酒店。印象較深的有以下三點：
1、接觸過的服務人員都非常專業，入住時前台人員看到我們帶小孩子入住，馬上升兩級房型，可見服務人性化意識強。入住期間所有需要反應及時，可見服務能力強。
2、貴酒店行政酒廊餐食老少皆宜，人員配置合理，服務到位。因為我每次都是入住後自己繼續忙於工作，基本留下孩子、太太和孩子外婆，所有預訂酒店一般原則帶有行政酒廊及HH待遇的（比如東方君悦嘉賓軒），更方便長者和孩子解決餐食需求。
3、泳池、温泉配套健全，游泳圈充氣設備及服務人都在，細節到位。不在贅述。

msg:週末最悠閑的放鬆方式應該就是去旅遊，但其實不出京就在酒店裡逛吃逛吃同樣很精彩，這個週末就選擇了勵駿酒店來體驗一下，之前就一直想來這。

提前下單預約了酒店，到酒店後趕上活動直接升級到了行政樓層，哇咔咔這運氣槓槓滴好啊。

推開房間門映入眼簾的就是金碧輝煌的感覺，所處的樓層高視野也相當好，都能遠眺西山的感覺了，哈哈，在金寶街這地界，這高度十分難得哦。房間十分寬敞，客廳寬敞，洗手間更加寬敞，超大的浴缸和單獨的淋雨空間都讓人感覺舒適。

卧室也很不錯，床鋪十分鬆軟，對床一向十分挑剔，但是睡在這個床鋪上分分鐘入睡，太喜歡了。

酒店房間好，餐飲更加贊，正好趕上了六月黃上市的季節，應季的菜單讓人直流口水，還有超值的黃魚套餐也很不錯。

酒店的地理環境也很優越去王府井或是天安門附近的景點都能腿着就去了，但因為酒店太舒適，舒服的讓我都沒有出酒店門的想法，泡在酒店裡度過這個愜意的週末時光。

酒店樓下就是熱鬧的王府井中心地帶，一進入酒店卻感受到一番靜謐與高雅的葡國風情，房間向北京站一面，夜間窗前的景觀極佳，大床寬闊舒適，房間內安排舒適安逸。浴室有舒服的浴缸，更是金色的金屬光澤鋥亮明媚，
洗漱用品是歐舒丹馬鞭草系列，是我喜歡的味道。
整個卧室的設計是洛可可（Rococo）風格，是從法文Rocaille，就是一種精細、精緻，卻歡快，明亮的感覺。

空間與格局因為合理的留白與牆上壁畫設計而顯得開闊與明亮，早餐在法式餐廳用餐，中式、西式均有，樣式不多但搭配一下也可以好好享受一份豐富的慢早餐，退房時酒店經理特意來問居住感受，幫忙叫車，貼心熱情。

msg:💃🏻不能遠行就在城裡住酒店，帶孩子換換環境過週末。我和孩子爸聊天，説漸漸住酒店成為一種生活方式，就像吃飯看電影一樣，同城度假過週末會被越來越多人接受吧。現在酒店行業也在調整戰略，滿足日常休閑遊，推出住宿帶餐的房間套餐格外划算，比如這次來王府井勵駿酒店，位置好、房間大、含3餐，一天1400左右的價格絕對驚艷。
這家酒店衹是表面豪華，住下來細品發現優點太多了，細節之處盡顯品味和品質感，讓人越瞭解越喜愛。

🌿全套歐舒丹洗浴用品就不説了，説幾個獨特的地方：
1、質量一流的防滑拖鞋
藍色是勵駿主打色，拖鞋特別舒服，鞋底踩在地毯上軟軟的，踩在地磚上有點粘，是防滑的。酒店希望你把拖鞋帶走複用，也不浪費。
2、書桌上有一瓶無酒精除菌液
氯寶寶除菌液可以噴灑任何地方，床鋪、沙發、衞浴馬桶都行，這個小瓶子滿滿的在意，疫情當下非常安心。
3、裝電源的收納盒
收納盒是定製的，電源妥妥的放在裏面，我就喜歡整齊有序的樣子。
4、行政酒廊晚餐4道式套餐
行政酒廊的晚餐通常是自助形式的，勵駿酒店單點的簡約套餐品質更佳，現做的主菜好吃很多，量也合適不會因為是自助而吃太多。

💎酒店裡很多值得逛的地方，有一些19世紀歐洲的古董藏在酒店中，比如上億的法國古堡裏的大壁爐、中餐廳門口的水晶吊燈、古董花瓶、古董鐘錶… ...不如慢慢逛逛，尋找寶物。

想出門逛街，過路就是王府井。
這真是一家寶藏酒店。

msg:我想這應該是我住過的服務最差的五星酒店了，全國各地住過不少五星酒店，沒有疫情的時候國外酒店也不住了不少，這次真的是讓我大開眼界，每次出行前都會習慣性的看看酒店評論，每家酒店的好差評都會比較均衡，衹有這家，差評全部來自於服務，那麼可見服務是有多差勁，首先説説入住，前台小哥的服務還算不錯，讓我們覺得酒店除了硬件設施不錯，服務也還行，到了下午和晚餐，進了餐廳，服務就體現出來了，餐廳一個外籍服務員確實挺好的，和我們家娃互動，但是到了中國籍女服務員我真的是給你豎大拇指，哭喪着臉不説，問什麼都是一副你欠她錢的表情，幫忙那個東西，你説句謝謝，人家連頭都不回，請問就算你不是服務人員，你家裡人沒交過你做人最起碼的禮貌麼，人家跟你説謝謝還是孩子，你連最基本的禮貌都不懂麼，晚餐更別提了，連要個寶寶餐椅，説了三遍都沒人搭理你，而且前台沒人登記，等了將近十分鐘，我們剛坐下過來問我們登記嗎，那你們前台沒有人，然後來質問客人是麼，孩子的餐具也是催了好幾遍才給，明明是有寶寶餐，但是都沒説，第二天午餐才知道原來有寶寶餐，但是服務員根本沒人説，再説一個很令人氣憤的事情，我們接咖啡的時候，聽見一箇中國籍女服務員説主菜裏的主食，他們（應該是我們這些用餐的人）要是不夠吃，就讓他們吃主菜，別跟她們在提供米飯，不是擺着有有蛋炒飯麼，吃那個，不夠也沒有了,然後還説“剛才一個小孩兒過來跟我要，我就給了，後來我想孩子也不應該給”請問這些對話是一個五星級酒店的工作人員該説的麼！！！你們五星硬件確實還可以，雖説有些陳舊，但是也能接受，但是服務水評和這些禮儀，我覺得連個3星級的快捷酒店都比不上，看了那麼多的差評，我覺得真是都沒有瞎説的，就是這種水平，酒店管理人員看到了也不做調整麼，既然不樂意就不要搞那種套餐，弄了套餐就請認真對待，都不説你們這午餐和晚餐確實不怎麼樣，這些都不説，但是你們是服務人員，自己本身不也就是普通老百姓麼，請問哪裡來的勇氣*****呢，這種酒店再也不會去住第二次，從來沒這寫過這麼長的評論，也極少給差評，不過這個差評你們酒店的服務人員真是絕對當之無愧，希望有打算去的朋友慎重慎重在慎重，別白花錢了！！！！同樣是五星酒店，人家凱賓斯基也是這種套餐形勢，比這家強的不是一星半點兒！！！！

退房那天早上我想去洗頭髮，其實離酒店兩三百米有一家，但酒店2層也有美髮店。我想着能開在酒店裡質量肯定是有保障的。所以花了230元洗吹。
這美髮店很簡陋，衹有一位中年大叔。洗頭髮的手法非常一般，不如我在外面花20元洗。洗完後説扎丸子頭吧，這大叔連丸子頭都不知道。我説那用電卷棒給我卷個高顱頂吧，結果這大叔給我卷得像大媽…關鍵是頭髮沒吹乾，手指一伸進頭髮裏還濕濕的，劉海都沒有幫我順，就一撮劉海擋在我眼前…
我回到房間後很生氣打電話投訴，結果酒店工作人員聽完後的反應竟然是“呃…”。然後工作人員説美髮店的老闆會上來幫我看看然後就掛電話了。等了很久沒有等到美髮店的老闆，工作人員又打來説讓我下去繼續把我頭髮搞好，我差點崩潰！！你把我頭髮搞成這樣子我怎麼還敢讓你搞？？之後我又等了一小時，沒有任何工作人員專業地給我處理事情我真得非常震驚！我去過不少國家和城市，第一次在五星酒店裡看到這麼不專業！
那天包括第二天，每個見到我的朋友都問我頭髮搞了啥怎麼搞成這樣！！

msg:前情提要：這家酒店可能是我生來住過的所有酒店中最喜歡的一家了。


房間設施：
房間設施全都是歐式風格，如果非要有一個詞彙形容的話那就是金碧輝煌？可能聽起來有點過但是真的切身體驗了就會知道是否真的適合這個詞語。

性價比：
全北京性價比最高的一家酒店，我定的商務套房，前台小姐姐給我升級了豪華套房，大概看了一下圖片比較的話豪華套房要比商務套房大了大概10-20平方這樣子，但是設施可以説並不會因為價錢而參差不齊！


早餐：
特意去品嚐了酒店的早餐，因為之前看到有很多不同的聲音，所以還是親自去品嚐一下實際。去的是法餐廳，真的很好吃，自助的形式，菜品真的很好吃！中餐廳沒去，下次有機會可以再去品嚐一下。


wifi：
非常流暢


床：
特意看了床墊，好像是麗駿自家的床墊？超級軟，躺上去就直接陷進去。


餐廳：
衹去了法餐廳，但是中途有路過中餐廳，法餐廳會比中餐廳更加歐式一點，但是各有風格不分伯仲。服務也非常到位，入座會貼心的拉椅子。


衞生：
唯一要説這個酒店雞蛋裡挑骨頭的就可能是衞生方面，浴缸上面有一根頭髮，但是也無傷大雅，整間房間除了這一個問題沒有別的問題。


停車：
有專屬停車場，停車費我記得是10元/小時


房間景觀：
可以看到繁華的鬧市區，對面就是麗晶酒店，但是具體也分房間的。


位置交通：
可以説在北京的眾多酒店中位置算是很好的了，具體大家可以看一下地圖！這裏就不過多介紹了。

游泳池、健身房等其他地方因為衹住了一天我都沒去體驗，但是聽其他住客説還不錯，大家可以自行去體驗。最後要説的是不管是哪個房型，大家收到的服務待遇都是一樣的，不會因為你的房間貴就更好的對你，這一點是很好的，另外美中不足的就是前台小姐姐在為我辦理入住的時候房間還沒達到好，我等了大概40分鐘也沒叫我，我過去問才知道已經好了，但是能理解因為那天確實人超級多！
總體評分9.5/10，超級滿意

msg:入住體驗非常不好，早上9點過到酒店，前台説有空房但不能讓我入住，因為規定入住時間是下午兩點以後，最多可以通融到11點半入住，要麼再多交半天房費可以立即入住。後來我1點半回到酒店辦理入住，看見前台有位女客人，前台告訴她等半小時到兩點鐘再回來入住。勵駿的做法確實讓人耳目一新大開眼界。下午兩點甚至三點後入住是國際酒店業慣例，但這是保底要求，不是必須。這樣規定的其中一個主要原因是酒店退房是12點，如果當天剛好滿房，新客人確實需要兩點後入住。但是，如果在有空房的情況下，沒有任何五星級酒店會讓客人等幾小時再回來入住。萬豪，洲際，希爾頓集團的酒店，我有時候凌晨5點到店，一樣順利入住。像勵駿這樣完全不管客人感受的，以後沒必要再選擇他家。

1.早餐和普通客户的用餐區域竟然是不一樣的，種類比商務酒店都少，且中國籍女服務員服務員帶了2次餐位 ，都被告知佔位了！6/25早餐，還是這位中國籍女服務員和她説冷牛奶沒了，朝我看了一眼沒搭理我 轉頭就直接走了！
2.下午茶/晚餐  種類少、且超級難吃
3.介於體驗了一次下午茶及晚餐，中飯就沒去吃過！
4.房間整理的還是不錯，沒摺疊的睡衣都摺疊好了。
5. 房間枕頭是我住過所有酒店最差的，睡變形後，到第二晚睡覺，都沒撐起來！

基於以上 不會再入住第二次！

第二次入住經歷：提前若干天預訂，因為趕上疫情，特意打電話諮詢，説可以住。以防萬一出發前做了核酸檢測。下午趕到酒店入住，被告知從**市來的人，不在中風險區域也不能入住，核酸檢測也不行，説是街道最新通知。我説帶孩子看病，之前預訂好的，有有核酸檢測，可是依然不讓入住。面對這樣強硬的要求我真是差點哭了，原想着帶孩子去協和醫院方便，沒想到即將露宿街頭。
後來附近另一家酒店看了我們健康碼，核酸檢測報告，收留了我們。終於我和孩子沒有露宿街頭。

豪華的酒店也需要貼心的服務，執行規定的時候也希望能多一點同情心。

This time I was tormented all day because of the invoice.
I placed an order on Ctrip and left a message with my friend, but my friend had to call me in person.
Repeatedly
The service is too bad. I will not come to this store again.

msg:1. There is no closed-loop management of the hotel to respond to the epidemic, or it is in vain! 2. After the accident, the working methods are rude and simple. The hotel manager and the staff colluded to shirk, deceive, shirk responsibility, and various Tai Chi... not taking responsibility, not having a sense of responsibility, not wanting what the guests think, not acting indiscriminately, which is really a loss. The standard of a five-star hotel! I am still under quarantine. Please don't book this hotel.
