The environment is beautiful, just a few dozen seconds away from the Qingyin Pavilion ticket gate.
It's clean and tidy. We came from out of town and there was also a high-speed rail pick-up station. Attached are a few pictures of going to the Golden Summit. Next time we will bring the family with us.

msg:The most correct decision for this trip to Mount Emei was to book Yixi Qingyin Hotel. Not only does it provide pick-up and drop-off services, but the housekeeper Awei also carefully helped us plan our travel route. Wuxiangang Station is right in front of the hotel, which is very convenient.
The room is clean and tidy ~ equipped with smart facilities ~ after climbing the mountain during the day, I can take a private bath among the flowers to relieve the fatigue of the day. There is also a large 85-inch TV in the room ~ this TV star is ecstatic! ! !
The most noteworthy thing is the service of the hotel. From the moment you enter, you can feel the warmth of home. The housekeeper Awei is humorous and attentive. The little brother at the front desk personally leads the way to the station. The beautiful sister who ordered the local chicken soup pot in the restaurant also asked Does it suit our taste~ When we checked out, our swimsuits were left in the room and the beautiful woman at the front desk helped us dry them~
I can feel that everyone in the hotel is not just about service, but they treat customers as friends. They sincerely hope that we have a satisfying trip. In fact, everyone really does that.
The only regret is that it rained in the morning and there was heavy fog in Jinding. But this is a pity~ See you next time~

msg:Yixi Qingyin Resort Hotel is great overall. The location is the ceiling of the Emei Mountain Scenic Area. The entrance to the scenic area is right at the door. It is convenient to travel and very quiet.
The location of the hotel cafe is great. It is great to have a drink on the cliff terrace. The restaurant is also very good, with rich dishes and authentic Sichuan cuisine.
The hotel staff is very enthusiastic, responsive and very fast in service. During the stay, they enthusiastically introduced the surrounding tour guide. They contacted one day in advance to inform us of the precautions for playing in Emei Mountain. It was very considerate. The hotel also has a pick-up service. There is no need to worry about unfamiliar roads. It is very worry-free to go directly to the hotel. The hotel has a parking lot suitable for self-driving. The guest rooms are clean and sanitary, the linens are very comfortable, and the toiletries are all available. The key is that the rooms have large windows facing the lush vegetation, which is super awesome.
There is also an infinity heated swimming pool. After playing in the scenic area during the day, you can go back to the hotel to swim and have a drink, which is very relaxing. 
This stay experience is very good and I recommend everyone to stay

msg:I brought my parents to Mount Emei and found this hotel by chance. The pictures and reviews were good, so I booked two rooms. The store's brother and sister came to the high-speed rail station to pick us up. After arriving at the store, my parents were very satisfied. The environment was very good, the room was clean, and the brothers and sisters in the store were very enthusiastic. They introduced us to the surrounding environment and took us to Wuxiangang Station to ask about the departure time the next day (the station is next to the hotel, 3 minutes walk). The entrance to Qingyin Pavilion is right outside the hotel. I especially want to thank the sister in the store. Because we got up early the next day to go up the mountain, she made us some vegetarian noodles in advance. Thank you for choosing you and adding a lot of color to our journey.

I asked the girl in the store, is it because of the good pillows and the high oxygen content outdoors that I sleep well here? She said that it is all, but more importantly, it is because of the "beautiful mountains and clear waters here, and the protection of gods".

However, I feel that this location is not very convenient for going to the top of Mount Emei. It is more suitable for a few friends to come together to relax, make a pot of tea, blow some water, and then lie on the bed and watch a movie at night.

The environment is elegant, the room facilities are tasteful, and the staff from the front desk to the restaurant are polite and answer all questions. There is an outdoor swimming pool on the fourth floor. The room we booked has a private bath. It is very comfortable to take a dip at night.

It is particularly convenient to go to Qingyin Pavilion here. It is adjacent to Wuxiangang Station and is convenient for travel. The catering is also very good. We had three meals, including chicken soup pot, radish soup pot, three fresh tofu, and stir-fried vegetables. They were delicious. There is also free rice dumplings made with rice wine grains in the evening. As the Chinese New Year is approaching, there are also paper cuttings for children😄

We saw the wonders of Xuesong, which was particularly beautiful. If I go to Emeishan in summer in the future, I will definitely choose this hotel again.

The room with floor heating makes me feel very comfortable when I come back from the trip. There is also a heated swimming pool in the sky🙀. People who didn’t bring swimsuits said they felt a little regretful, but the private hot spring bath in the room made up for it a little bit... The hotel's attention to detail is still memorable, with a kettle with temperature prompts, very delicate tea sets, high-quality and easy-to-use hair dryers... And when eating breakfast, the aunt asked kindly if there was anything I couldn't eat? The breakfast was delicious😋. I will come again next time. Recommendation index five stars🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟

As soon as I entered the room, I made an appoin**ent with my friends to come and play together in the summer. There is also a road leading to the river at the entrance of the hotel, and you can go rafting in the summer. The ticket gate of Qingyin Pavilion is at the back door, and it is really a second to enter the scenic area

msg:I have stayed in many hotels and B&Bs in the past few years, but I rarely write reviews. But this time I was really satisfied with the Yixi Qingyin I chose in Mount Emei. I was less worried about getting into trouble when reading the hotel reviews, but in the end there were no surprises at all! The scenery of the hotel is outstanding. All facilities, services, and configurations are online. The whole house has floor heating, a courtyard with a private bath, the bathroom and bathroom are equipped with summer care, and even the tea provided in the room is very good. It is no exaggeration to say that if the same configuration is placed in Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai, the price will at least double.
Location: Right at the entrance of Qingyin Pavilion Scenic Area, next to the scenic area transportation Wuxiangang Station. I stayed for 3 nights. I slept in and had breakfast every day, then walked slowly to the bus station and took the bus to the scenic spots. I also went to Genting on the middle day. In the evening, I returned to the hotel to order food and have a bath. The food and restaurant environment of the hotel were also good. It's great, and you don't have to look for a hotel outside. This time I stayed in a double bed room with a private courtyard (picture 1) and a twin room (picture 5). The double bed room has a larger courtyard and better privacy. If you don't bring a private bath, there is a large swimming pool with a nice view on the roof to soak in, which should be pretty good.
Needless to say, the service is really needless to say. We picked up and dropped off at the hotel to and from the Emei High-speed Railway Station. I really felt at home. I have already planned to invite friends to stay with me for a few days during the summer vacation.

In addition, the back door is less than five meters away from the scenic area, and you can see monkeys in a 3-minute walk.

Location: At the entrance of Qingyin Pavilion Scenic Area of ​​Mount Emei, you can walk to the transfer parking lot to go to Jinding.
Facilities: New hotel, very textured, public areas are all art and flower art (the housekeeper said that they just picked up whatever they could find in the back mountain, but it was very beautiful), the mattresses and sofas in the room are very comfortable. The most amazing thing is the hot spring, the room has a private hot spring, and there is a constant temperature infinity pool on the third floor. Think about the small sunken bar table by the pool, it should be very comfortable to come in summer!
Dining: Breakfast is rich in variety, and there are many freshly made pastries. Freshly ground coffee is also very delicious. Dinner was induced by a sentence of chicken soup and ordered a table, only to find that it was really a Sichuan chef YYYDS! Vomiting blood recommendation: eel, bacon and chicken soup, as well as fresh vegetables from the farm every day.
To be honest, I came here to relax, but when I saw the New Year activities at the door, I couldn't help but write a couplet. In fact, the best experience is to hike or drive to the back mountain of Mount Emei, where the winding paths are secluded and extremely beautiful!
This time, I really wanted to bring my family here while staying here. I stayed in several farms on Ctrip and they were all quite interesting. I hope they keep up and get better and better!

The heated infinity pool is open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, and the electricity bill is free! By the way, the back door is the entrance to the Qingyin Pavilion scenic area, yes, the one that is right outside the hotel's back door. It's nice to see the scenery and monkeys. I recommend it!

When we returned to the hotel in the evening, we had a big pot of local chicken soup, which doubled our happiness. The staff in the store are very kind. When they see us going out, they remind us to bring bamboo poles. If we order too many dishes, they remind us that we have enough. When I opened the door in the morning, it was like a fairyland filled with smoke. Friends joked with each other. I will stay a few more days next time and my physical examination indicators will be normal when I go back:)

2024-04-05M22827****
I wanted to live in nature, so I booked this hotel with my children. Someone came to pick me up from the high-speed rail station. The young man was very friendly👍, introducing the situation of Mount Emei all the way, and he was quite patient! As soon as I entered the mountain, I was amazed by the beautiful scenery. The room type was facing a touch of green + red maple. Suddenly, I didn’t want to go anywhere. The heated swimming pool on the 4th floor was the favorite of children. The small number of people was equivalent to a private room. The room was quite ordinary and was completely paid for the scenery, but it was worth it! The heated shower was quite hot, and the children could only take showers intermittently. The smart towel rack had a little problem... If nothing unexpected happened, I would come again. When I left, the hotel sister gave me a souvenir, which felt very warm. I actually checked out on the last day, but the children were still playing in the swimming pool. I told the front desk, and they opened the room and arranged for us to bathe the children, which was more humane. In short, this kind of green scenery makes people feel relaxed and comfortable... Suggestions: There are not many places to sit in the public area of ​​the hotel room, and the tea room on the fourth floor is also very small and stuffy. Although we booked a double bed room, it was no problem for three generations of us to stay there! (I slept on the bed chair).

首先位置很好，就在清音閣入口處，去金頂的大巴也在附近，不管白天晚上都可以聽到猴子活躍的聲音，偶爾看到猴子出沒，又不會被猴子們打擾到。附近有溪流，在酒店能聽到溪流潺潺的聲音，聽到鳥叫蟲鳴，聽到猴羣在活動，除此之外，沒有其他的雜音。很神奇的是，這麼好的位置，房間裏依舊很安靜，遊客的聲音卻完全傳不到房間裏。這是萬萬沒想到的。
酒店品味很高，不管是軟裝還是園藝都特別好，簡單大氣又舒適。酒店各處裏展示的攝影作品啊，畫啊，都很特別。有些是藝術家的作品，有些是老闆自己的作品，在酒店裡休息的時候到處看看都是驚喜。
房間的景色超美，對着山發發呆也是非常愜意的。即使被臨時的工作打擾了旅遊的休閑，衹要看一眼窗外，情緒就會得到安撫。窗簾是電動的，馬桶的智能的，毛巾架都是帶烘乾功能的，投影的效果也很棒。不管天氣冷了熱了，都很宜居。這是我最滿意的，不會因為靠近景區有了地理優勢就忽略了房間的細節。
另一個值得一提的是這裏的味覺體驗，室內的房間的洗浴用品等，都是觀夏的，跟風景很契合，特別好聞。室外整個山林則充斥着滿滿的生竹筍的味道。
屋頂的無邊泳池還沒體驗過，下次再來我一定要帶上泳衣！看着山景泡着玩兒！

msg:非常舒適的一間酒店，全體都很滿意！

位置極佳，出餐廳，上台階就是清音閣景區入口。整幢小樓掩映在羣山之中，在火熱的夏天，於綠蔭中走進酒店，接站的小哥哥幫忙拎着行李，迎賓的小姐姐微笑問候，感覺心裏都妥貼了。

房間也很漂亮，躺在乾淨舒適的床上，正對着大大的明亮的窗，滿眼的綠和滿耳的鳥叫蟲鳴，撲面而來，一起入夢，又悠悠喚醒我，這就是童年的夏天了。

特別感謝高鐵接站的小哥哥，耽誤您吃飯啦，謝謝您周到的接待，還有暖心的伴手禮，下次我們還來！

房間很好，幾乎落地的大窗真的很治癒，傍晚在窗邊盯了很久鬱鬱葱葱的山，晚上拉上窗簾打開投影，享受屬於自己的峨眉假期；
服務非常好，有位年輕靦腆的男生穿着中式工作服來高鐵站接我，車開的也很穩，幫我辦理入住，給我指去景點的路；
早餐晚餐很好吃，量很大，可以在樓台吹着小風用餐，總之因為住了這個酒店，峨眉行多了份愜意和享受，推薦給大家。

服務：服務絕對的好評，個人認為，比五星級酒店的都周到，態度也很好，隨時有事，衹要是微信上問一下，很快就有回覆。接送站都很及時，還有幫我們考慮到很多我們自己都沒有想到的注意事項，我們去坐觀光巴士和去散步，也有工作人員引領，還會提醒我們吃早飯，和晚間的糖水，上山前還幫我們準備了用品和補給。
  總體的各個方面，我真的都超級推薦，從服務人員的素質，到周到的服務。從設施到衞生，我也是十分滿意的。入住後，這個景色也很心曠神怡。這個民宿，無論從性價比來説，還是任何方面，是我完完全全會給五星推薦的！

服務方面，更是讓我感到驚喜。酒店的員工超級熱情，從前台接待到客房服務，每個人都笑臉迎人，讓我感覺就像回到家一樣。他們還會主動提供一些遊玩峨眉山的小貼士，讓我的旅程更加豐富多彩。

房間乾淨舒適，設施齊全，晚上靜悄悄的，保證了我良好的睡眠質量。早餐種類豐富。

總之，這次在峨眉山的住宿體驗超級棒，不僅讓我能夠好好地放鬆身心，還讓我深深感受到了當地的文化氛圍。下次有機會還會選擇這裏，也強烈推薦給朋友們！

衞生：乾淨衞生沒得説，全是山泉水好評

環境：在清音閣景區和五顯崗車站邊上，上金頂或者下山乘坐公共交通方便，不知道是不是因為面對山谷，也非常安靜

服務：晚上管家還煮了銀耳湯和米酒湯圓你敢信，害得我娃睡前又幹了兩碗
