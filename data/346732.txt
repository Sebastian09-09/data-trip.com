msg:My third time staying at this hotel and it just gets better and better 

Angela added my WeChat and shared so much helpful information with me. Helped me to book a trip to the outlet mall and many other things. She was an absolute superstar

Wesley is the sweetest. Very fun to talk with and so helpful. He gave us lots of information and told us about new areas of the hotel. 

Since my last visit the hotel has opened an adults game are with billiards , VR , darts and more. They even have a Starbucks inside. 

Hotel is placed perfectly on the beach and we quite often had the beach to ourselves. Breakfast was great and whole experience was fantastic. 
Another hotel update is a free photography service. You can book a time and take photos and receive 10digital photos for free . I‚Äôm honestly amazed this hotel is a holiday inn as it‚Äôs absolute paradise with amazing staff ü•∞

msg:Thank you, Holiday Inn Resort Sanya Bay and Bailey. After a wonderful stay over the weekend, I accidentally left my watch in our room after check-out. When I realized this on our way back home, my wife immediately messaged Bailey to ask her if they could search our room to find the watch. After finding it and letting us know, they insisted on sending the watch back to us at their own expense. They paid for the SF Express, and after a day, I received my watch along with a few goodies they added. Excellent service.

A unique experience with a warm welcome and a very nice and wonderful service from Ian Lan! (Speaking english), he helps us everyday and arrange everything for us. Any questions, he can answer. And he also anticipates our needs which more than perfect! 
One improvement that the hotel should do is to improve the offer for lunch and dinner. A little bit more possibilities will be great. (We are also in china and lot of possibilities around for deliveries anyway)

- Ideal size hotel and grounds - not too big and not too small.
- Great service.
- Lovely sea-view room, well appointed.
- Great breakfast.
- Great-value noodle bar for lunch.
- Nice pools.
- 10min from the airport.
- Awesome lobby and complementary afternoon tea.
- Great activities for kids (and useful room card keys for kids).
- Very short walk to the beach (across a public road).
- Nice beach (although no swimming).
- Cute kids playground.
- Good photography promotion with reasonable prices.

Not good:
- Construction on one entire side of the gardens and pool.
- Pool needs more shaded areas.
- Pool waterfall never switched off‚Ä¶.the sound can relax or distract you at night.
- Some wobbly poolside decking under a rubber mat gave the impression I could fall through it.
- No parasols, loungers or refreshments on the beach.

The hotel pools were large and clean, and the restaurant provided plenty of Chinese dishes (western options were a bit limited, but good quality). All in all, this was a lovely stay and I would stay there again.

This room was absolutely beautiful, we were greeted with a bottle of wine and the staff have incredible english speaking skills. I would absolutely recommend this hotel  to any foreigners in Sanya or visiting sanya, it is a stones throw from the airport and has a beautiful view of sanya bay. This was the perfect stay, seamless, easy and completely relaxing thanks to their amazing staff. I wish I had known about this hotel before! I had an early morning flight so they arranged a takeaway breakfast and ensured that dinner arrived to the room through their ipad ordering menu! Thank you so very much again!

The sea is about a minute's walk from the property, pretty much in front of it but not private - which means you may find a bit of trash on the beach. Nothing egregious but you'd wonder if the hotel puts any effort in cleanjng up their surroundings. The guy working at the lobby lounge bar was super helpful. The gym was small and felt like a tacked on afterthought.

I will certainly comeback to this hotel for next vacations. Highly recommend it.

It was spacious and the ocean and pool view was magnificent. There were children‚Äôs activities daily. She really enjoyed the pool foam party and water balloon fight. Breakfast was delicious and there was never a wait for a table, even during high season. There was easy access to the beach, located directly in front. The only downside was the lack of beach chairs, but it didn‚Äôt really matter. Overall, everything was great.

Location is far from city center, but as a compensation you get empty, beautiful beach few steps away, no crowds in hotel and very peaceful enviroment. Even though hotel is by the airport, I promise you will not see nor hear any plane. Breakfast was great- both chinese and western food, a lot of choices for everyone. Stuff was very helpfull and friendly, Here I would like to mention Hana, who add me on wechat and guide during all stay. Whatever I need, was provided by hotel instantly. 
Rooms are new and very very comfortable. All you need is there. I especially enjoyed automatic beer machinese in the lobby. in my opinion, this is one of the best hotels in Sanya if you want to enjoy nature and cool down a bit from your busy life. I will come back for sure.

I booked the flight + hotel half a month in advance. In terms of choosing a hotel, I read a lot of reviews on Ctrip. This hotel has a high score and is *** kilometers away from the airport. The sea is across the road from the back door of the hotel, which is very convenient to go to the beach. The bus station is also at the back door of the hotel, and it is also very convenient to go to scenic spots. The original deluxe king-size bed room was upgraded to a deluxe pool view king-size bed room for free, which is very nice! I would like to thank the housekeeper Huang Lixia (Anny) for a little episode in the first two nights in Sanya. Once the child forgot to take the water cup, and once the child lost the water gun. The housekeeper followed up and responded to the message quickly. The day before I was going back to Beijing, the housekeeper told me that I would get a free airport shuttle service. However, the return flight time was changed again and again by the airline, and the housekeeper also helped coordinate the time of the airport shuttle service. Thank you very much üôèüèªIf I have the opportunity to come to Sanya again in the future, I will choose this hotel and the housekeeper Huang Lixia (Anny) again!

The hotel is very close to the beach. The beach is just across the road. There is a small outdoor playground with a small train in the hotel, as well as an indoor one. When we checked in, a guy took our luggage and sent us to the room. The housekeeper Winnie responded to our calls on WeChat. If you want anything, just say it and she will arrange for it to be sent to the room immediately. So we stayed here again on the last night. The housekeeper also upgraded our room type and delayed our check-out. The hotel also arranged a business car to send us to the airport. The children had a lot of fun. I rarely write reviews, but it is worth it.

The room was very large, clean and relatively new. The minibar was free on the first day (including a bottle of Coke, a bottle of Sprite and a small bag of potato chips). The room was delivered with 6 bottles of water and a plate of fruit every day. The swimming pool was open very late, and there were still children playing around 10 o'clock. The balcony can directly see the sea. The weather has not been very good these days, and the sea is not so beautiful, but the scenery is still very beautiful.
The breakfast is very rich and there are many choices. There are cartoon people delivering balloons at the door, and robots can help you cook noodles. It's fun. Afternoon tea is delivered every day when you check in.
Overall, the hotel is very suitable for bringing preschool children. There are many children's club activities. There are also activities in the swimming pool every afternoon, and there are activities to catch small crabs at the beach in the evening.
Finally, the hotel also gave a small gift the day before check-out, which is very sincere. I will bring my children with me next time üòÄ

msg:I took my two children out to play during the holidays. I originally thought that there would be fewer people traveling in the off-season, and there wouldn't be too many amusement facilities or activities. In fact, the children had a lot of fun here. It can be seen that the hotel is really dedicated to the activities. Here I would like to talk about my personal feelings from check-in to check-out. First of all, I arrived at the hotel early on the day of the holiday and the room had not been cleaned yet, so I stored my luggage and waited for check-out and cleaning. The front desk left my contact information, so we took the children to make an appointment for children's activities. What made me feel particularly good was that the girl on duty at the children's playground treated us very warmly. She didn't refuse the children from entering the children's playground even though she knew that we hadn't checked into the room yet. The children's playground is a good place to play, which also avoids the negative emotions brought to the guests by waiting for the room. When I asked her about the reservation method of related activities, she took the initiative to help me make an appointment for the projects I wanted to participate in. I felt that I was not working for work but loved this profession and position very much. About an hour later, the front desk contacted me and said that I could check in. Since we contacted the butler Gao Zhi in advance before checking in, he arranged a room with a good view for us. The room was also equipped with several bottles of mineral water, and a welcome fruit plate was given. On the child‚Äôs birthday, a homemade birthday cake was given by the hotel. It was amazing. The subsequent activities after check-in were really well organized. Work The enthusiasm of the staff can really boost the atmosphere on site and let the children participate well. My eight-year-old and two-year-old children can play very happily. They said that the activities of this hotel are too great. It should be because that day is Children's Day, so small prizes are set for each activity. Even if there are no winners, the staff will give consolation prizes, so that every child is paid attention to and will not feel lost. This is very well considered, which shows that the leadership is sufficiently empowered. Every employee has played a sense of ownership, which makes parents and children feel very nice. The hotel's Chinese restaurant dishes are also good. From managers to employees, they are very enthusiastic to greet the children. Phew, in short, this stay was a good experience. I will recommend it to my friends. Thanks again to the hotel recreation for organizing such fun activities. Thanks to Gao Zhi for his enthusiastic arrangement. PS: I have two small suggestions. Since our hotel is mainly for families, it would be great if the rooms could be equipped with a one-size-fits-all children's bathrobe and one-size-fits-all plastic children's slippers, because they definitely want to play in the water, and almost every family who stays here brings their children. If you call the guest service center, there may be more services and the waiting time will be longer. Another suggestion is that breakfast can be equipped with more chopstick baskets so that they can be easily found when eating, instead of having to find staff when there are not enough.

Service: Children's swimming rings and sand digging tools are all free to borrow; here I would like to thank the housekeeper Liu Jing for her thoughtful service, helping us to make reservations for all activities in advance. I only mentioned whether the twin beds can be combined, and she helped me arrange the bed in advance. The twin beds can be combined, which is very good for families with children.

I saw someone recommend this hotel on Xiaohongshu before, and I was worried that it was a scam. After staying here, I felt that it was really good.
First of all, the hotel's swimming pool is very reasonably designed. Children of different ages can have a good time. The activities that the hotel uses to guide children are very interesting and arranged very reasonably. Our baby often doesn't want to participate in that activity, but as soon as he sees the guidance of his staff, he will participate. Basically, everyone is participating in the activity, and they are very happy and enjoyable.
The service is the biggest highlight. First of all, as soon as I came in, the butler added WeChat and sent welcome fruits, and then everything was taken care of. The staff here actually remembered my name and room number, and everyone would greet me politely when they saw me.
Then the hotel's indoor playground is also designed very carefully, and there are many activity rooms. The travel photo provided by the hotel is also very satisfactory. He also sent makeup and clothes.
By the way, all the swimming rings, floating boards, swimming towels, and sand digging tools on the beach are provided for free, and they are prepared completely from the perspective of convenience for guests.
The breakfast is also very delicious, hey, I can't praise it enough
If I go to Sanya in the future, I will definitely stay in this hotel.

There are many activities for adults and children to participate in. We had a lot of fun. The only small problem is that the small refrigerator in the room is really not very cold. I can't drink a cold drink after playing in such a hot day... Hehe [awkward] I hope it will be improved next time I stay! At the end of the check-out, the child's room card was used as a small gift, which is thoughtful and cute!

There are also many parent-child activities, and my daughter had a lot of fun. I stayed in Sanya for seven or eight days and changed three hotels.

The staff in the hotel are very friendly. Joyce will also remind you to close the doors and windows when you go out at night, etc. She is very thoughtful and responds to questions very quickly!
The room is very clean. Although it is close to the beach, it is not damp at all. It is very convenient to go to the beach. The aunt cleans the room in time.
The breakfast is also good, with many varieties and good taste.
It can be said to be a very nice experience. I plan to stay here next time!

I read the comments that the deluxe king room has a sea view, so I booked the wrong one. It turned out to be facing the airport. Fortunately, the balcony glass door is well soundproofed and it is quiet. There may be a lot of people on May Day, and the hygiene and staff service need to be improved. In general, if you want to book a hotel close to the airport on the return trip, you can still choose it, and you must choose a sea view room!

In terms of food, there is an excellent buffet, a lot of delicious fruits, ice cream. Sausages and sushi, though not for everyone. They make individual omelettes.

The room has everything you need. Bottled water every day. If you run out of something, they will bring it in 5 minutes. Excellent blackout curtains. Very nice balcony with wicker chairs and a table.
There is a refrigerator, safe, TV.
The bathroom opens up nicely on all sides. Snow-white towels.
To the sea -1 min. on foot.

They play with children here sincerely, there are many activities for them. From morning to evening - they are princes and princesses, their own menu, foam parties, games every hour, a children's room.
In a large pool, however, children all swim in circles or in armbands - otherwise the lifeguards whistle. The children's pool is heated. Everything is very clean.

You must keep in mind that there are no shops or cafes nearby: either eat in a restaurant - dishes from 1000 rubles, or take a taxi and go to another place for lunch. Taxi is inexpensive, from 300 rubles.
The hotel is near the airport and their shuttle bus can take you there during the day.
Thank you very much to all the hotel staff for your care and warm welcome!

Although this hotel is small and well-equipped, Holiday Inn is also a big brand. We didn‚Äôt book breakfast because we had to catch a flight. I don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like. Xiao Lu at the front desk was really nice. He helped us coordinate the room when our children needed to take a nap. He was kind-hearted and dedicated to his responsibilities! There is a swimming pool downstairs, and you can reach the beach in two steps. The sand is stronger than that of Yalong Bay. The only thing that has changed is that the management of the swimming pool is too rigid. They only lead children to play. Adults and children cannot stay far away. The lifeguard blows the whistle if you are farther away. The children all brought swimming rings, and there were so many lifeguards. I stayed in more than 10 hotels in Sanya, but the lifeguard at this hotel was the only one who felt that he was not a lifeguard, but that he was trying to prevent your parents from leaving their children. It was too fussy, maybe the hotel Do you have requirements in this area? If it can be improved, I think the hotel is perfect. It is small and refined. It is my type. I am not tired when I stay in the hotel.

1. During the stay, the customer service staff Ms. Dong Jinyan (I hope I remember the name correctly üôèüôè) was very patient and thoughtful, and helped me open the door several times. I often forget to bring my card and lock myself out üòÖ
2. Hana, the housekeeper assigned by the hotel, contacted and shared various parent-child activities before arriving at the store. During the period, she also patiently helped to register and answer questions.
3. The swimming pool and children's playground facilities are good, and the children can have fun. The gym, afternoon tea and travel photography were not used due to time reasons, and I will come again if I have the opportunity.
4. The hotel is 600 meters away from the beach, and you can go to the beach every day to pick up shells and dig crabs.
5. Disadvantages: We upgraded to a family suite, but the room lighting was very dim, there were many switches for lighting control, but the instructions were unclear, and it was not convenient to turn off the lights. The hotel TV projection requires a paid membership (the maintenance staff explained that the system has been upgraded, so some require membership and some don't...) Finally, the hotel is quite far away. It takes about 25-30 minutes to take a taxi to the city center, night market, etc. It also takes 15-20 minutes to take a taxi to the nearest Internet celebrity restaurant for dinner.

Maybe the hotel‚Äôs activities and facilities are fixed, but Lily‚Äôs thoughtful and enthusiastic service and meticulous help make this Sanya Bay holiday trip even better. Maybe Many hotels have activities of this kind, but they do not necessarily have such employees to make the service more vivid and make the hotel more aura.

msg:Traveling with parents, we booked a family sea view room. Before arriving at the hotel, the butler Gao Wei asked us what we wanted for the room, and helped us upgrade to the family suite in the west building after arriving. The room is very large with two bedrooms, two living rooms and two bathrooms. There is no noise or mosquitoes. My parents are very satisfied with their stay. The breakfast is very rich, and two afternoon teas and travel photos are given for free. The elderly also prepared anti-slip mats for travel, and provided airport drop-off service after leaving the hotel. Both the service details and the hotel facilities are very good. The beach is behind the hotel, which is very convenient! I will choose Holiday Inn next time! !

Environment: Beautiful scenery, the hotel lobby is quite beautiful. Across the street from the hotel is the beach.
Service: The front desk is warm and considerate. Thanks to the service of WeChat housekeeper Winnie (I don't know if He is a real person or AI, so I use the word "He", which can mean "angel üëºüèª", which is gratitude and praise).
Transportation: There is a bus stop at the entrance of the hotel, and the hotel has convenient transportation. Thanks to the hotel for the airport drop-off arrangement and the business car driver for the airport drop-off.
The hotel breakfast has many varieties, which can be described as rich and delicious. The juices are freshly squeezed and the coffee is freshly ground, so the quality is good and the taste is good. Balloons are given to children during the meal, so that the children can enjoy the happy time of breakfast. I sincerely thank the hotel staff who have worked hard for breakfast.
Finally, I would like to thank the management and staff of Holiday Inn, and thank Ctrip for providing the booking platform. I wish the relevant personnel of Holiday Inn: happiness and joy!

msg:The flight was cancelled and I had to change to a flight the next morning, so I booked a night near the airport. To be honest, it was a good hotel with good parent-child service. Children liked it. But the room was small and the soundproofing was not very good. The sound of flushing toilets next door or upstairs was very obvious. The sanitation was OK, and the overall cost performance was average. The male check-in person at the front desk was very good, and he prepared breakfast for us to take away the next morning. But the housekeeper I added didn't provide any service. The front desk asked me to scan the housekeeper's WeChat, and then sent some hotel activities as a routine and ended. They contacted me the next day when I left, asked me how I felt, and asked me to give her a good review with her name. How could I give her a good review if she didn't provide any service? Maybe I only stayed for one night, so people didn't care, so don't ask me for a good review, it's all mutual.

She is like an old friend, and she is responsive to all requests. You can find her for any problem. It is very convenient and worry-free. The 10 travel photos sent by the hotel are also very beautiful.
Children can choose their favorite room cards. The room is very large, and the children can jump around in the room. Including children's slippers, bathrobes, shower gel shampoo, toothbrushes and toothpaste. The courtyard is not big, and there are not many things to play, but it is enough for young babies.
The buffet breakfast is very rich and tastes very good.
When checking in, seeing that we brought a child, we automatically upgraded the room type, gave us more space, and took the initiative to help us send the luggage upstairs. When we left, we were also busy sending the luggage to the car. A lot of mineral water and welcome fruit were sent when checking in. There are really few hotels like this, and the breakfast is also very well prepared. In addition, every staff member you meet in and out of the hotel will greet you enthusiastically. It really feels very warm and worth recommending.
Children's Carnival Parent-Child Activities: Pool Bubble Show Party is the favorite activity of children.

Fresh and friendly service! The housekeeper Leo was also super considerate and responsible. Because the plane was delayed, he communicated in advance and helped us prepare footrests, bed rails, and use electric mosquito coils in advance! We ordered takeout at noon and forgot to order rice, so we asked the housekeeper for help, and the hotel thoughtfully gave us two bowls of riceüçö!

There are also hotel travel photos, ten simple photos, leaving wonderful travel memories! On the way back, I consulted the housekeeper, who also thoughtfully provided airport drop-off service.

The buffet breakfast had a wide variety of dishes. They all tasted good. I only had dinner in the restaurant once, and the kids and I ordered a bowl of noodles and a portion of dumplings. The noodles were really delicious. But the price was not cheap. There was also a complimentary afternoon tea every day, which could be eaten in or taken away.
I was particularly satisfied with the butler service, and I was very grateful to Wesley, the butler, for taking care of everything. She was very convenient and worry-free.
The 10 travel photos sent by the hotel were pretty good.

Wang Yu'e, the housekeeper, was very nice. She helped us upgrade and reserve a room in advance, gave us mosquito repellent, a bracelet, a large bucket of water, installed fences in advance, and other warm arrangements. Thank you very much. The hotel also prepared a room card exclusively for children. The breakfast was rich and delicious. The hotel and the swimming pool were very clean, with a modern decoration style, equipped with a Dyson hair dryer, a refrigerator, and two beds put together, which were super large and comfortable. The hotel is close to the airport, and the beach is just across the road. The hotel also provides airport drop-off and a free shuttle to CDF. Staying here is like a vacation.

1. The sea view family room was given on the top six floors, with a great sea view. 2. The hotel is very close to the sea, and the beach is just across the road from the south gate. Although it is a public beach, the hotel will bring folding chairs and sand digging tools to the beach in the evening, and you can sit there. 3. I didn't expect it to be a very parent-child hotel. From the children's room card, to the small dolls given when checking in, and the big dolls for children's meals for breakfast. It is very popular with children. After a rain, the heated swimming pool was cleaned. There is also a punch card that the baby loves to earn stickers for small gifts. The guy who dug crabs tried very hard and caught the first crab for the baby. 4. The butler service is particularly worth mentioning. Our butler Yu'e has been in touch with me since the day before check-in to understand the needs. Because the flight arrived at noon, the room was arranged in advance and the children's layout was made. Pay attention to everything. The airport drop-off service was also provided. The front desk and other hotel staff I met were also very enthusiastic. The baby said: I will stay at this hotel next time I come to Sanya Bay.

msg:I am back from a trip to Sanya. I brought a total of 10 people, young and old. I looked at many hotels before going. I was confused. I saw a lot of good reviews of Holiday Inn on a certain book, so I decided to book a date. First of all, the location: Holiday Inn is located near Sanya Bay Airport, and the noise from airplanes is acceptable to me. The hotel facilities are relatively new, and the seaside is not as humid as imagined. When you enter the lobby, there will be a guy to help you push your luggage~

Due to the uncertainty of the itinerary, I booked different room types on several platforms. The check-in day was a weekday, which is considered off-season in Sanya, and there are not many people staying. The front desk helped me upgrade a room type and I was very satisfied~
When I checked in, I added the housekeeper WeChat, Carrie Shao Haijuan, who responded to everything throughout the process! She is really a very considerate and comfortable housekeeper! After checking in, we asked for our requirements and helped us put up the baby fence. There were fresh fruits every day. We also gave small cakes and exquisite gifts on our birthdays. It made me feel the sincerity of Holiday Inn in treating guests.
There is a swimming pool under the main building. It is also very reassuring to have the swimming pools for adults and children connected together. There are bubble parties every afternoon. The hotel also has some small activities. Our baby is less than 2 years old and can only swim, but we are still very happy. The most important thing is that the hotel is across the road to the beach, which is not as crowded as the Coconut Dream Corridor. It is completely enough for children to step on the water and dig sand! !

Then I especially recommend that families can stay in the family garden view room (1.8 beds + 1.2 beds) for family travel.
In short, I will still choose this hotel next time I come to Sanya! It‚Äôs really not a thunder! Highly recommended

msg:My two-year-old son brought me to Sanya for the first time. I stayed here first and then moved to Tianyu. Compared with Tianyu, this beach, hotel facilities and hotel restaurants are more suitable for families with babies.

Strollers are accessible throughout the hotel. The swimming pool is large and has both warm and cool pools. The water quality is clean and the children's shallow heated pool is completely drained and the water is changed between day and night. The ground around the swimming pool is very clean without a lot of garbage, tree branches, or children's urine. Oh, it's okay even if you walk barefoot

Breakfast is available until 10:30. The variety is so complete that you can‚Äôt finish lunch after breakfast. There is a pasta buffet for lunch for 48 yuan. You can eat all kinds of noodles, wontons and the like until 3:30 in the afternoon.

At 50 square meters, the family room is not very big, but the design is very reasonable. We have three adults and one baby, and the space is quite generous. It can also accommodate the baby to play in the room. I especially love the small tent.

The sea in Sanya Bay is really sp****ly populated, wide and has small waves, and the beach is very deep and very delicate. Although it is a wild beach, it is clean and smooth. It is so rare. After traveling from Sanya Bay to Yalong Bay, I saw that the sea in Yalong Bay is surrounded by hotels. There are also Garbage cigarette butts and snot paper really feel like the whole world has been lost. . . In particular, the beach of Yalong Bay is full of vendors who relentlessly sell various things. They will also loudly discuss some people on the beach. When in Sanya Bay, there is basically no forced sales of travel photography, and they are very polite to ask when they are busy with children. I won‚Äôt bother you. I really miss the sea in Sanya Bay.

Next time you come to Sanya, you must stay at Sanya Bay holidayinn! ! ! ! Enjoy your stay! ! ! !
Finally, I would like to thank my housekeeper Sophia Lu Shuxiang for helping answer many questions. The hotel front desk is also responsive to requests. See you again! !

msg:I came to Sanya again this year and chose to stay at the Holiday Inn Resort Sanya Bay, which is very close to the airport. I chose this hotel because of many good reviews online saying that the hotel is very suitable for bringing children. After checking in, I felt that it really lived up to its reputation. The hotel services are thoughtful and considerate for customers. For example, you can call to confirm the day before check-in. When you arrive at the hotel, someone will help you move all your luggage to the room. You don't need to do it yourself. There is tea in the hotel lobby. For snacks, the hotel also has many parent-child activities every day, such as making small cakes, various competitions, and my son's favorite bubble show. I would especially like to commend the housekeeper Hana Sun Shiyun for being able to think about what the customers want. When my son injured his knee, she immediately found disinfectant and responded promptly to any problems. The children were reluctant to leave after finally leaving and wanted to play the bubble show. They will definitely choose this hotel next time they come to Sanya.

I deliberately chose this holiday hotel that I had visited 11 years ago for the last night of my trip. It was definitely the most cost-effective hotel.

The most intuitive feeling is that the software and hardware facilities have been upgraded, and the service is considerate and humane. I was particularly impressed by Jack: warm and meticulous.

The hotel is really child-friendly. They arranged to collect stickers and receive small gifts, which gave my little one a great sense of accomplishment. Children can play all water sports (if I remember correctly, they are all free)

The new style of the hotel is particularly elegant, and the hardware keeps up with it.

Especially the service in the catering depar**ent! 1Ô∏è‚É£It is very close to the airport, and the online car-hailing service only costs 11 yuan, which is very convenient. But the hotel is not noisy at all and is very quiet. The hotel had been renovated and upgraded when we arrived, and everything was brand new. 2Ô∏è‚É£The hotel is right next to the Coconut Dream Corridor. My son and I walked to the beach in about 2 minutes. The sunset on the beach is super beautiful. Digging in the sand, watching the sunset, and picking up shells. If it weren't for the fear of getting too tanned, my baby would wish he had grown up on the beach. 3Ô∏è‚É£In terms of hotel services, especially the housekeeper Arlen and the catering manager Liu Guangyi, they have demonstrated their attentive service to the extreme. Seeing that I was traveling alone with my children, they immediately helped me check in, and were very considerate in guiding the hotel's various parent-child activity times. I bought afternoon tea as a package, and I drank afternoon tea while listening to the singer. It didn't feel too beautiful. 4Ô∏è‚É£There are so many activities in the hotel. After staying for 3 days, my children looked forward to going back to the hotel to participate in activities every day, such as water gun fights, bubble queues, children's playground, water polo fights, baking cookies and cakes. My child is almost 8 years old and wears a phone watch. , completely liberate the old mother! 5Ô∏è‚É£The breakfast is very rich, no queues, not much to say, see the picture! Manager Liu‚Äôs warm and friendly smile is simply the most beautiful sight! You also helped take my sloppy little boy to wash his hands, what a good guy! 6Ô∏è‚É£Disadvantages: 1. The hotel receptionist was a bit slow to respond. When we took the room card and went to the room, he didn't help us with our luggage... When we left, it was very good. As soon as we arrived at the lobby, he helped us with our luggage the whole time. It's good to make progress. 2. There is only one nozzle in the hotel bath, and there are only two modes of spraying. It is a bit difficult to wash the children who have returned from playing with their heads covered with sea sand.

Even the Atlantis hotel behind me was very satisfied, but it did not affect the good impression left by this hotel at all. The housekeeper Winnie is also very meticulous and prepares children's toiletries and slippers in advance.

The butler Jack explained it very thoughtfully~
All hotels in Sanya Bay are outside the hotel, across a small road to the beach. When you go back to the hotel from the beach, there is a back door, and there is a faucet for washing your feet, which is considerate~
The afternoon tea is delicious, not so sweet; the coconut chicken set meal is also good~

msg:I chose this hotel after looking at Ctrip's ratings. When I first went through the formalities at the front desk, I felt that the service at the front desk was very friendly and warm. Later, something unhappy happened during the check-in process. The customer service butler Xiao Gao immediately responded I was given a reply and responded to the manager in a timely manner. The efficiency was quite good. First of all, I was very satisfied with the attitude of the customer service manager Sun Shiyun. Secondly, I was also very comfortable with the process and solution of the whole matter. The hotel's rating was indeed 4.9. It was made by the employees themselves. The only flaw in this stay is the travel photography provided by the hotel. To be honest, the hotel's overall impression can be given 4.9 points, while the travel photography can only give 0.5 points at most, and the 0.5 points are for the makeup artist. Yes, if the person who took the photos for us can be called a photographer, it would really tarnish the noble and professional profession of a photographer. Since it is provided by the hotel, is it because we don‚Äôt spend money and are just so casual and perfunctory? , if the photos are good and you don‚Äôt let us buy them, we will also take the initiative to buy the photos. If the business is like this, it will really damage your own brand. The time of our vacation is arranged. You can‚Äôt take the photos well. Your influence is not big, but it is a waste of my time. Because I have reported that the professional skills of travel photography are too mediocre, the travel photography company did call me later and asked when they could find time to help me reshoot. I really want to give it to this travel photography company. It was an opportunity, but my time was so tight. In the end, I didn‚Äôt handle it well, so it just fell into place! In short, I would like to give you a suggestion. When staying in this hotel, firstly, try to communicate with the hotel about the room type and location in advance. Secondly, do not choose the travel photography provided by this hotel. It is too perfunctory, basically has no technical content, and only clicks the shutter. Does a key photographer deserve to be called a photographer?

I can‚Äôt guarantee that it is the best, but I definitely won‚Äôt make any mistakes. I was very satisfied with the whole experience. The service is very good. The butler Gao Zhi added WeChat and went there to solve the problem very well. The manager on duty is also well-managed.

The breakfast is very good, and there are lollipops. The variety and quality are better than those of Tianyu and Coral where we stayed, but the price is the cheapest, which is very good. The all-you-can-eat noodles at the Japanese restaurant for 38 yuan are highly recommended. The group purchase meals at the Chinese restaurant are also delicious. Overall, they are worth recommending.

msg:I took my family on a self-driving trip around Hainan Island. I had stayed at MGM Yalong Bay in Sanya before. This time I chose the Holiday Inn Resort Sanya Bay considering the convenience of free activities in the surrounding area. I booked a king-size bed room with a pool view. The hotel contacted me by phone one day in advance. Confirm the check-in details; check in at the hotel at around two o'clock in the afternoon. The girl at the front desk (later I added WeChat and found out that she is: Lu Shuxiang Sophia) has a very kind service attitude. I saw that some elderly people and children upgraded their rooms for free, and helped to make some hotel reservations. There are various benefits and discounts that can be enjoyed in the hotel. Children staying here can also choose a cartoon room card. The children like to take the initiative to swipe the card to open the door during the two-day check-in period; the hotel has several swimming pools, and the children's small pool is constant temperature; The breakfast is crowded but not crowded. There are many varieties and a lot of choice. There are wooden gates on the road near the hotel near the sea, which is very convenient to go to the sea. There is a small dolphin seafood restaurant about 2 kilometers to the left of the hotel, which is also good and worth checking in. You can drive there by yourself. Parking B2 (there are too few parking spaces at the entrance), but there is a battery car that can take you from the hotel lobby to the garage. It was quite interesting after taking it a few times. In summary, I was very satisfied with all aspects of my two-day stay at the hotel. It was value for money and the hotel staff Everyone has a very good attitude. They will answer any questions enthusiastically. I would like to thank the dedicated butler Sophia again for her professional and meticulous service during my stay. I will choose this place again if I have the opportunity.

msg:This was the first time I traveled to Sanya alone with my children. Because I thought the children would be very tired after a 4-hour flight, I chose the Holiday Inn Resort Sanya Bay, which is relatively close to the airport. The hotel's unexpectedly thoughtful and attentive hospitality.
First of all, the location of the hotel is excellent. It is very close to the beach. It takes 2-3 minutes to walk to the beach. We upgraded the room for free. The sea view is very beautiful. I watched the sunrise and sunset in the room. The beach is also very beautiful and you can pick up a lot. The colorful little shells, small conches, and vibrant hermit crabs were also caught. The children also loved the hotel's water park.
Secondly, Winnie really provides a private butler-style service from the time you check in to the time you check out. From the operating hours of each hotel facility to the children's services the hotel can provide, Winnie will notify you of every detail through WeChat from the time you check in. The baby provides a starry sky night light and reduces our unnecessary troubles.
Third, children's room cards were prepared for the children. The room was cleaned promptly and cleanly, and the items were prepared carefully and considerately. Extra mosquito repellent water was prepared, and the effect was also very good.
In addition, due to limited time, I only experienced the food in the cafeteria, which was also very rich and had a young lady singing nice songs.
In fact, when you go out, especially with a baby, many details cannot be described in words. Many of the cares taken without fear of trouble are very touching. It is still a good choice to come here next time.

Service: Butler-style service. Butler Wang Xiuhua is very considerate and satisfied, and answers all questions. The afternoon tea provided is also thoughtful. It is very suitable for some snacks and juices when you are tired from playing. I don't like that the drinks are all soft drinks and juices are not freshly squeezed.
You can delay check-out until 2 o'clock. During check-out, manager Liu Guangyi was also super warm. He found a comfortable place for my grandparents and mother-in-law and also gave me free drinks.
Breakfast and dinner: There are relatively few supporting facilities around. You have to take a taxi when going out for shopping and eating.

There is a 198 seafood buffet for dinner, which is very convenient. You don‚Äôt have to carry the elderly and children around. It‚Äôs very convenient.

msg:The hotel environment is really good. The adult pool and children's pool are separated. The children's pool is heated and very comfortable. It can be used as a hot spring when it gets cold at night. The service is also very good. The experience when I checked in was also very good. There were basically children's activities from morning to night. The arrangements were full. The children were very happy. They made cakes, glutinous rice balls, and various water activities such as bubble battles. They were still at the door at night. The beach has prepared a crab and goose catching activity, which is really lively. The small gifts given can make the children very happy. The children have been unwilling to sleep these days. Sophia Lu Shuxuan also took good care of us. I needed a computer temporarily for work, so she helped me borrow one. She also helped us prepare a considerate way for our early flight. I was really happy this time. A few more comments: the quality of breakfast needs to be improved, the taste does not match the service; it is recommended that all cream be replaced with pure animal cream; there are too many water guns that cannot be used. The staff are very hard-working. Even if there are no guests at night, the lifeguards at the swimming pool are still sitting high and guarding. It is very hard and makes us feel at ease. I hope it will get better and better in the future. I will still want to stay here next time. Checked in!

       Then there is the swimming pool, which has warm water and is very suitable for children. There are also daily activities for children, which is very rich!
       The buffet set I ordered on Chris**as Eve night, the seafood was very fresh and there were many varieties. At this moment, I really hate that I have a small belly and eat less, haha! There were performances and raffles during dinner, and everyone had a great time!
      There is free late check-out and gift service when leaving the hotel, which is very considerate.
      By the way, the child may be acclimatized and has a slight fever. I asked the hotel front desk for a thermometer, which was sent immediately.
     Overall, the service is very good. I will choose here again next time I come!

After that, the housekeeper Anna will be there. A kind of proactive contact, various inquiry needs. As soon as we arrived at the hotel, there were hotel staff who helped us with our luggage and then sent them directly to the room, which was not very nice. The formalities upon arrival at the front desk were very smooth, and the housekeeper Anna personally helped with the process. Although I booked a basic room type, the price and room were still good and matched perfectly. After checking in, every time I passed the lobby, there were employees who took the initiative to say hello.

Real-name thanks to a male staff member at the front desk at 9:30 a.m. on November 23. I confirmed with the housekeeper that his name was Wang Xiuhua. He has been actively working hard to help children find lost toys. He attaches great importance to children's emotions and feelings because toys are of great significance to children. You have to carry it with you everywhere, it feels like a sense of security. In the end, it took a lot of effort to finally find it. During this period, the staff was also thinking of other plan B to remedy the situation. I feel that children are also taken seriously here. Thank you for protecting the sense of security of a two-year-old child. From crying when I lost a toy to being moved and crying when I found it again, I really cried to death, you are so great! Will recommend it to all families with children around me!

msg:I think Holiday Inn Resort Sanya Bay is the best family hotel in Sanya Bay. The hotel is about 20 minutes' drive from the airport. Across the road is the Coconut Dream Corridor. Although the sandy beach is average, it is better because it is sp****ly populated. Family activities in the hotel are arranged from morning to night. You won't feel bored even if you stay in the hotel. I am very satisfied with the hotel's Chinese and Western restaurants. For lunch, we had coconut chicken hotpot and dregs and vinegar hotpot. For western food, I had Indonesian fried rice, pasta, burgers and fries. Dine in the hotel restaurant and enjoy both delicious food and excellent service. It's much better than eating at those seafood food stalls outside. Just a four night stay. Every staff member gave me a great service experience. Special praise goes to restaurant manager Wesley Liu, bar waiter Lin Zhihan, and front desk housekeeper Anna. Maybe every tourist who travels to Sanya has his own way of playing. It can be said that Holiday Inn Resort Sanya Bay fully met my needs. This is the Sanya I want. Fit is most important!

1. The breakfast is rich, there is a children's dining area, and children's plates are provided. Balloons are also given to the children for breakfast, just in time to trick the children into eating seriously, so the aunt will give them to them üòÇ. Looking out from the restaurant is the hotel swimming pool and the train.
2. There are plenty of parent-child activities, including mini trains, bubble parties, water gun fights, children's play areas, etc. All activities are free and there are no additional charges. And there are several large and small swimming pools that can be used separately by people of different ages.
3. The room is clean, the facilities are relatively new, and the sound insulation effect is very good. Therefore, although it is very close to the airport, I really didn't hear any noise from planes taking off and landing.
4. The service is also very good. It can be seen that the parent-child service is very good. All the waiters are smiling towards the children. It also provides many conveniences for traveling with children, including free strollers, children's toiletries, slippers, etc. There are also many lifeguards next to the swimming pool, and there are also many arm floats for children to swim in.
5. If you are an Intercontinental member, we will proactively provide airport drop-off service.

I was thinking of moving to Dadonghai to stay in a cheaper B&B in the future. On the day I went to the B&B, there was a typhoon and heavy rain, and the room was a bit cramped. It was humid and the children clamored to go back to the hotel, so we came back and stayed until our return on the 25th. My mother and children, including myself, particularly liked this hotel, especially the housekeeper Hu Xiaozheng, who upgraded us to a sea view room. From check-in to departure, I have been very attentive and meticulous. I thought about what the customers wanted and arranged a drop-off when I left. This includes all the staff here, from the leaders to the cleaning staff. They are always considerate. The service is all done with a smile, and the lifeguards in the swimming pool are also very friendly to children. Children really like the small activities here, as well as the cute elephants and dinosaurs. The weather is hot, they are really hardworking, and they have to make the children happy, which is reflected in the whole hotel. In addition to their corporate culture and employee quality, they are about to return today. The child said he was reluctant to leave the hotel. He originally came for the attractions, but ended up having fun in the hotel. I will still choose this hotel next time I come. Definitely This is not a compliment, this is my first time to seriously write a review, and I sincerely recommend it!

I was not disappointed at all and had a very pleasant vacation. The housekeeper contacted us in advance before we checked in. Winnie Wu Shuhua, the housekeeper, was very kind. Knowing that we had children, we prepared bed rails in the room in advance. The view of the sea view room is very good. I like to sit on the balcony every day to enjoy the breeze and watch the scenery. The hotel is completely family-friendly and provides children with room cards, so children can check out their own rooms, which is super fun. There are different parent-child activities every day, unlimited mini trains, constant temperature swimming pool, free swimming rings and sand digging tools, indoor children's playground, so you will not be bored in the hotel every day. The breakfast is also very rich and tastes good. I ate Baoluo powder and Qingbuliang for three days in a row haha. There is also a children's dining area. In the morning, the staff will dress up as dolls and deliver balloons. The children are very happy every day. The location of the hotel is also good, not far from various scenic spots and places to eat. On the last day of the return trip, the road was flooded due to weather, and the hotel's free shuttle service couldn't be used. The hotel has been helping us take taxis to see us off, and the service is really good. I will choose it again next time I come! üëç

Facilities: The hotel is relatively clean overall, with complete parent-child facilities. The children did have a lot of fun in the hotel.

The surrounding environment is relatively clean, and I don‚Äôt have much to eat, so I have to take a taxi to go out.

The only drawback of the hotel is that there is no private beach. It would be perfect if there was one.

msg:It was originally a temporary hotel decision, but it turned out to be the most satisfying hotel in this trip to Sanya. The hotel is very close to Phoenix Airport, and you can also take the high-speed rail to Phoenix Airport Station. There is a shuttle bus from the airport to the hotel, but you may need to make a reservation in advance. Although it is close to the airport, I didn't hear the roar of the airport at all when I slept at night.
The housekeeper Arlen Xiao Yueyue called and added WeChat on the first day of check-in, and he felt the hotel's perfect service a day in advance. Including but not limited to the following: upgrading the room type, confirming the check-in time, cleaning up the room in advance and notifying them in time, booking hotel parent-child activities for the children, and even ordering takeout and delivering the tableware to the room in time without giving chopsticks.
The hotel has a lot of parent-child activities, and there are bubble shows in the swimming pool every day. There is a shallow and heated pool that is friendly to younger babies. There is a road away from the beach. You can pick up large snails on the road, and there are many small crabs on the beach.
The breakfast is also very good, and the twin beds in the room can be shared. The hair dryer is a Dyson. The only drawback is that there is no bathtub. It's a hotel you can stay in again. Give the hotel and the housekeeper 100% [rose][rose]

This time, because I was raising two children and everything was convenient for parents and children, I chose Sanya Bay, which has convenient transportation, and also chose the more famous Sanya Bay. It‚Äôs a good choice for a family hotel. The children had so much fun playing that they refused to come out of the swimming pool every day. The swimming pool has a depth suitable for all heights to meet the different needs of the two children.

I didn't expect to encounter a rainy day on the first day I arrived. The family hotel really played its role. I'm so glad I made my choice. The day before arriving in Sanya, the housekeeper Gao Fangbin took the initiative to add WeChat. When he arrived in Sanya, he contacted me as soon as possible, which was very considerate. Various event reservations and consultation issues were communicated and resolved in a timely manner, and the service was in place. In the end, he actually asked if he could delay check-out and drop off to the airport. Because the third day of our trip was on the West Island, we asked if we could be sent to the West Island Pier. Unexpectedly, they enthusiastically sent us to the West Island Pier. It was very considerate. This hotel was well worth choosing. Very suitable for staying with children.

The last time I came to Sanya, I booked a non-family hotel, which was a bit disappointing. During the three-day holiday in Sanya Bay, the baby was very happy, exceeding expectations. On the day of check-in, the housekeeper Sophia added WeChat, sent afternoon tea, upgraded the room, and gave children dolls and gifts. All children's supplies, including small tents, wooden horses, table lamps, toiletries, etc. were installed in the room. We also participated in several children's activities, including cake making, bubble show, ring tying, etc., as well as small gifts. The children were very happy. I would like to praise Mu Junli from the Recreation Depar**ent. He led the children to dig crabs in the evening. They were unlucky that day. After digging several holes, there were no crabs. The children did not give up. Mu Junli said, "If the children don't give up, I won't give up either. Finally, I dug them." I got a super big crab, and my son was very surprised. We had an early flight on the last day and didn't have time to have breakfast. Sophia, the housekeeper, specially arranged to pack three breakfasts, which was very considerate.

The swimming pool is very shallow, suitable for children, and the water is only 90cm deep. There is a bus in front of the hotel, and it is very convenient to go to Yemeng Corridor and Tianya Haijiao. The butler Gao Fangbin was attentive and responsive to every request during our stay.

I booked a sea view twin bed and was upgraded to a sea view family room, where I could see the pool and the sea. The bed was very comfortable and the kids loved the tent inside. We also gave welcome fruits and enough water. The hotel has quite a lot of parent-child activities. After making desserts in the restaurant at 3pm, you can go to the swimming pool and wait for water activities. Children often don‚Äôt want to leave. Maybe it's close to the city, but the hotel overall feels lively and noisy (compared to the previous Intercontinental Mid-Levels). The attitude of the service staff is a little colder. Basically, you will be asked to take the initiative before they reply to you. It is rare to encounter someone who takes the initiative to say hello and provide help (only personally) Experience, the attitude of the staff at parent-child activities towards children is quite good), and we encountered a lifeguard with a rude tone in the swimming pool. We reported it to Winnie on WeChat. Later, the superior Manager Wu also paid attention to it, and our problem was properly resolved. , thank you Winnie and Manager Wu!
The water park was not open during my visit, and the big swimming pool was closed on the last day, leaving only a few other small swimming pools to swim in.
The overall area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel is relatively small, so you can visit it all in one go. Across the road behind the swimming pool is Sanya Bay Beach. There are chairs and sand digging tools prepared by the hotel next to the beach. In the evening, you can watch the sunset and dig for crabs. The sunset is really beautiful!
The coastal seafood near the hotel is delicious, and the boss provides free pick-up and drop-off within 5 kilometers.
During your stay, the doorman at the hotel door was really attentive to service. No matter whether you were checking in or dropping off at the airport, or going out to eat or coming back, he would always take the initiative to open the door for you as soon as possible. He would also help you with your luggage if you had any. It was very considerate! grateful!
The hotel also provides a free business car to the airport. The driver is on time and the car is spacious, which is really good!
In short, the hotel is very comfortable overall, lively but not crowded (off-season), and the surrounding area is convenient for eating. Great stay here for 3 nights! Very close to the airport but quiet in the room.

And the hotel also provides tools for catching the sea. There is a flashlight in the room. The coach takes the children to catch crabs on the beach (all of them are released when they leave), which is very interesting. We really dig and dig and dig. The hotel also gives fruit and coke. The children said that this hotel is really generous. I remember that I went to Tianyu the year before last. There was a charge for taking the small train, and the swimming ring was not provided. I had to buy it myself. It was free on holidays, and it was provided for free. Generous . The reserved room has afternoon tea, which is also delicious. Because the flight was at 5 pm, the housekeeper Wang Xianbang delayed the check-out time and sent us to the airport. It is really good.

The first night was because the plane arrived in Sanya around 11 o'clock, and I wanted to find a hotel closer to the airport. Then I didn't want to live in a hotel that was too old. I checked the renovation time and it was okay, so I made a reservation. As a family hotel, all kinds of children's activities are very interesting and there are no extra charges. All kinds of services give people a very warm feeling, especially the housekeeper Sun Shiyun, who is very considerate and helps to book various parent-child activities and provide airport drop-off service. She is very temperamental and kind-hearted (I am a female and I come from a female background) appreciation).
To be honest, it really exceeded expectations, so I originally planned to stay only for one night as a transitional stay, but on the last day I canceled my reservation at another hotel and checked in again. And the price/performance ratio is very high, highly recommended for family travel. A friend said that he would come to Sanya for a while, and he was also traveling as a family of three. He asked me to provide a guide. I plan to focus on the Amway Holiday Inn! I will choose his home again when I come to Sanya in the future. It will be a pleasant trip. By the way, the travel photos provided are also great, and the Dyson hair dryer and toiletries are great~

msg:After reading a lot of hotel reviews and seeing the high-quality reviews from most people, I finally chose to stay here. The hotel is not too big, but the kids love to swim, so it is enough. The hotel service is very good, one-on-one caring service, answering every question, responding to every request, as soon as you check in to the hotel, you will receive fruit as a welcome. The beach is just across the road from the entrance of the hotel, three minutes away, very convenient. The kids love this hotel, the breakfast, the service, the swimming every morning, the small gifts, and remind me to give it full marks. Some small comments: 1. The floor of the hotel room was very slippery after being wet with water, and the child fell because of it (Arlen Xiao Yueyue was very considerate and dealt with it in time. In order to express his apology, he sent fruit and prepared gifts for the children üéÅ) Attitude Very good, but the problem of easy scratching of the floor needs to be solved to avoid injury to guests. 2. The activities arranged by the hotel for children every day are not very good, and the quality is not very good. Even my five-year-old child finds it boring. It is recommended that the hotel organize parent-child activities Work hard. After all, there are many people who travel with children. Improvements in this aspect will definitely attract more guests. Thanks again to Holiday Inn Resort and Aelen for a great couple of days.

From morning to night, there is also an activity to collect stamps to get small gifts. The hotel in Sanya Bay needs to cross a road from the beach, and the road is driven by cars. , There are no beach chairs by the sea, but this hotel seems to provide folding chairs by the beach. We have never used them. I don‚Äôt know if they are free. In the evening, if the weather is good or not, there will be an outdoor seafood buffet. There are barbecues and hot pots. Although there are not many varieties, they are all available. It's very fresh and delicious. The manager Liu of the restaurant is very talkative. He actively asks the needs of the guests and is willing to ask the guests to give their opinions. It is very heartwarming. Thanks to the personal butler Winnie, who reminds us of the time of children's activities and breakfast time on WeChat every day. He is very meticulous. There are many types of breakfast, but there is no change at all after staying for four days. The noodles are delicious, and I like eggplant marinade. The pool safety officer is very responsible. Children are not allowed to enter the deep pool alone. (1m4 deep) need to be accompanied by parents , Or just play in the children's pool, life jackets and boogie boards are provided for free. Children have a great time playing here, and they won't get tired of playing in the hotel without going out every day. It's really good. Come again next time.

Environment: It basically matches the picture. It is only one road away from the seaside of Sanya Bay. It is very convenient. You can take your baby to pick up shells, or you can play with the sand and visit the Coconut Dream Corridor. The environment of the breakfast restaurant and the Chinese restaurant is also very good, decorated in a simple new Chinese style. The buffet dinner was not able to dine outdoors because of the light rain in the past two days, so we used the breakfast restaurant.
Facilities: The swimming pool is heated, which is very good. The swimming rings, goggles, and small shovels in the swimming pool can be used for free. It is very convenient and user-friendly. The hardware configuration of the room is basically qualified. The toiletries are not very easy to use and can be improved. The breakfast restaurant and the Chinese restaurant have all kinds of meals, and the dishes are very fresh and unique.
Hygiene: The linen in the room is comfortable, there is no skin sensitivity or discomfort after using towels, and the cleaning can be kept up to date. There is no obvious garbage in each public area. The children's activity room, naughty castle, gym, and restaurant are all clean.
Service: I think it is also a very important item for customer experience. From the confirmation of the reservation, the Sanya Bay Holiday Reservation Depar**ent will communicate by phone in advance and arrange for the housekeeper (He Shengqiang) to add WeChat. If you need help throughout the process, you can call and message. Restaurants, swimming pools, housekeeping, children's areas, and personnel at various locations, whether they are summer interns or full-time employees, can all serve with a smile.
Overall, it is worth everyone to stay and experience, within everyone's budget, especially friends who like to swim, go to the beach, eat and drink! (Bring mosquito repellents)
Thank you~

Every day, the hotel has different parent-child programs for children, all of which are free. My son likes to make snacks every day, and he can eat by himself. The bubble show every day is also his favorite. The breakfast is good, basically everything you need is available, the supply is sufficient, and there will be staff to deliver balloons. My son was so happy that he refused to leave, saying that he would stay for a few more days next time. I heard that the water slide is being planned, and I am looking forward to it. I hope that the price will not increase when I come next year!

It is inevitable that there will be many problems with children, and the housekeeper can help them solve them in time. Because the seaside is humid and the floor of the room is always wet when washing and bathing, the service staff immediately put a blanket on the next day. It is so considerate. The hair dryer in the room is still Dyson Yes, very friendly to female compatriots.
In particular, I would like to thank a beautiful woman in the restaurant. At breakfast, I brought Erbao to eat breakfast alone. I couldn‚Äôt find her in the blink of an eye. I wanted to go to the bathroom and asked the sister at the restaurant door to take her there. It is very rare for the service staff to have love outside of work~
I will take the kids there sometime~

msg:This hotel's rating of 4.9 is definitely a plus! ! ! Brushed out! Brushed out! Say important things three times! It's not worth staying at this price! ! Let me talk about my personal experience. First, the hotel parking lot is on the second floor of the building next door. It is completely disconnected from the check-in building. Moreover, the parking lot is under renovation. It is dirty and messy. There is no guide sign. After looking for the elevator for a long time, I thought it was parked in. "Farmhouse". Secondly, the hotel check-in was very perfunctory, and the number of rooms was relatively tight when checking in. However, the front desk directly gave me room 444 when there were other available rooms. Is this because room 444 cannot be sold? Prioritize looking for someone to take advantage of? Thirdly, there is no air conditioning in the restaurant on the first floor. In such a hot weather, I have to eat breakfast every day and sweat all over. I once again thought that I was staying in a "farmhouse". Fourth, there are no anti-slip slippers or anti-slip mats in the room. I fell twice in the three days I stayed there. If I hadn‚Äôt held on to the bathroom door tightly, I would have definitely fallen. If a child falls and hits a dangerous part, what do you think? Disposal. Fifth, I was so drunk on the so-called parent-child activities, it was so low! What about fooling people? If you don‚Äôt know what parent-child activities are, you can go out and learn more! The so-called one-to-one butler service was established after we contacted the front desk several times. The activities were chaotic, and if we didn‚Äôt have the organizational skills, we would just have an open-ended casual experience. Sixth, the mattress is not good. It is too soft. You will sink in when you sleep on it. It has no support at all. When you turn over, the whole bed will bounce like a trampoline. Without the facilities that should reflect the price, you will wear the whole mattress. Mori hair dryer? Dyson can live forever if he blows it? Your room that costs more than one thousand a night is almost the same as other rooms that cost four to five hundred dollars. In terms of luxury, it only has a Dyson hair dryer and a higher-end toilet basin. Do you need these? Get rid of all the bells and whistles! There are no necessary safety facilities. What‚Äôs funny is that there is a warning sign posted in the bathroom to be careful about sliding on the floor! I've been looking for a long time and I don't know where to hold on. Hold on. Do I need your reminder? What I need is that you put anti-slip measures in place! ! Although there are two floor drains in the bathroom, the water drains very slowly. Fish farming? Come out directly! It‚Äôs really too bad. Some cheap and fast hotels are not like this, right? To sum up, this hotel is extremely cost-effective. It costs 500 a night. Is it because of the InterContinental brand? Are you embarrassed to sell it for more than a thousand?

msg:Traveling with two children, considering the car will cause motion sickness, not too far from the airport and the service and sanitation environment, choosing Holiday Inn is beyond expectations. This time I went to Sanya to choose a parent-child hotel for the first time after having a child. Holiday Inn Resort Sanya Bay has done a good job in parent-child service. Sophia at the reception is kind, caring and patient. The first impression was very good. I met during the stay All the staff are very kind, which is a plus for the service prepared for the children. The children unconsciously said "Why do we like everything prepared by the hotel?" When they left, they all said that they would come again. Generally speaking, it is a parent-child hotel suitable for immersive hotel tours. Both adults and children can stay comfortably without leaving the hotel. In summary, the room is comfortable, there are many parent-child activities, the service staff is high-quality, the buffet has a variety of choices, and the Chinese restaurant tastes good. Children like digging sand on the beach to pick up shells and playing in the pool, which is completely satisfying for adults and will not be tired, but children can have a super fun experience.

msg:Holiday Inn Sanya Bay is a fascinating resort hotel. When I came here for the first time, I was deeply attracted by the beautiful scenery and first-class service. The hotel is located on the golden coast of Sanya Bay. The white sand on the beach is delicate and the sea water is clear and blue, which makes people feel like they are in paradise.

The hotel rooms are nothing short of amazing. The room I stayed in was very spacious and luxuriously decorated. Outside the window was a charming sea view, which made me feel like I was in the sea. Every morning, I can see the beauty of the sunrise from the balcony and feel the power of nature and the beauty of life.

Apart from the room, I was also impressed by the service of the hotel. The hotel staff were very warm and friendly, helped me with many problems and made me feel at home. I would also like to give a special mention to Arlen, the hotel housekeeper, who is one of the best housekeepers I have encountered at Holiday Inn Sanya Bay. Throughout my stay, the constant attention to our needs and requests made me feel very caring and warm. Arlen is very professional and enthusiastic. He not only helped me arrange a lot of activities and itineraries, but also provided me with a lot of useful suggestions and information, so that I can better understand the culture of Sanya and make us feel that we have got the best here service and care. I believe that with his help, Holiday Inn Sanya Bay will become even better and better. I am very grateful to Arlen for his service and care.

In the end, my vacation at Holiday Inn Sanya Bay was wonderful and unforgettable. The beauty, the service and the facilities here gave me a taste of true resort living and made me fall in love with this place. If I have a chance, I will definitely come here again and feel the beauty here again!

msg:Although the program of the hotel was good and everything was perfect.
I was very disappointed with the front desk staff at checkout on the last day.

7/26-7/27, I knew that I was paying 988 yuan for a night's stay on site, and I was aware that Trip.com would refund
After breakfast on the morning of July 26th, when I went to the hotel lobby because the door key was not turned on, I was told that I had to pay 988 yuan, so I paid with my MasterCard. .
However, when I went to the lobby to check out on the night of July 26, the staff at the lobby said that I had to pay 988 yuan again. I wondered if there was a mistake, so I paid 988 yuan this morning, so I asked to check it, but the staff didn't understand and kept asking for a card while waiting for a taxi to the airport to pay.
I told them that I had already paid several times, but they didn't listen at all. In the end, because of flight time, I gave the card again and the employee paid 988 yuan again. Looking at the card payment details, it was confirmed that 988 yuan was paid twice on July 26, and the attitude of the staff that day was very frustrating. I will make a formal complaint through Trip.com. Please cancel the payment immediately.

msg:The most satisfactory hotel in Sanya and Lingshui this time. The hotel is very new, and there are several swimming pools, and the beach is just across the road. The service attitude of the hotel staff is very good. When I arrived at the front desk, I upgraded to a sea view room. At the same time, I would like to thank Wang Xian, who was very considerate and prepared breakfast for me when I had an early flight the next day. Recommended several friends to live in this hotel. The hotel lobby only sells swimsuits, so it doesn‚Äôt matter if you forget to bring your swimsuit, just buy it downstairs, which is not available in many hotels.

msg:After staying for eight nights, I wrote an in-depth review and found that the experience was average, so the following is only about the shortcomings.

1 On the first day I checked in, I didn‚Äôt sleep well. I was very happy and tired early in the day. However, I was woken up by the hotel‚Äôs alarm clock at 12 o‚Äôclock in the middle of the night when I was deep in sleep. The child was also woken up. I usually wake up because I don‚Äôt sleep well. Didn't sleep well all night. The alarm clock was set by the hotel itself by default. It was so ridiculous that the customer service gave me a free dinner to compensate the next day.

2 Breakfast quality is very poor:
1] Meat quality is generally not good: sausages and hams in sandwiches are basically starch sausages.
2] Juice section: The celery juice was very sweet after taking a sip, but later I was told that the so-called juice is mixed with sugar water and is not pure juice;
3„ÄëSalad section: One morning the lettuce smelled muddy, so I guess it wasn‚Äôt washed properly. One morning, I don't know if something in the refrigerator was broken. There was a strange smell of feet on the salad leaves. The mung beans also had this smell that day.
4] Cooling and replenishing area: Fortunately, I smelled it every day. One day it was corn kernels that were sour, one day it was red beans that were rancid, and two days that mung beans were rancid. There are many other condiments that I have never tasted so I can‚Äôt comment.
5] Pancake section: One morning the pancack‚Äôs egg smell was too strong. I don‚Äôt know if the eggs were stale, but it‚Äôs not like this every morning.
6] Cold dish area: I ate smoked chicken breast on the first morning and it had a strong smell of salmon. The refrigerator smell was so strong that I never ate it again.
7„ÄëHot dish area: The menu is missing from time to time. I can‚Äôt tell what kind of meat it is. I asked the waiters and they didn‚Äôt know.
8„ÄëCoffee is terrible to drink. The beans are not fragrant and have a strong burnt taste. It is uncomfortable to drink. Later, I always bring my own instant coffee to make it. I don‚Äôt drink boiling water directly, but hot water is not hot when drinking hot water. One waiter asked another waiter why you didn't light the alcohol lamp, but later he still didn't. Every morning, the waiter usually had to go to the kitchen to pour boiling water for me.
9] Oa**eal area: There were three types of nuts at the beginning. It seemed that when there were more people the next day, the almond slices disappeared and turned into bread. Later, the walnuts disappeared and turned into a biscuit. In the end, only the seeds were left.
 I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it to families who pay attention to the breakfast experience and whose babies are young and pay attention to the quality of their diet.

3 Poor facility management
The stretchers in the gym are all installed backwards and cannot be used. The elliptical machine is also not very easy to use and sometimes works well or not. It can be used, but for example, sometimes you can only increase the resistance. Pressing the button to reduce the resistance also increases the resistance. Other instruments are useless and will not be evaluated. But the management seems to be average. I go there every day, but on the last day before I leave, someone comes to me to register my room number. I joked that I didn't use it before, and they said that everyone needs to register.

4. Poor swimming pool management
There are different heated pools at different times in winter, but the opening hours of the pool (and the time you can actually swim) are not sure. Sometimes the swimming pool scheduled to open at six o'clock only has a shallow layer of water at six-thirty, making it impossible to swim. The staff said that water was still being released from other swimming pools. If this is the case, why set a timetable?

It's great, the fruits and seafood are delicious, and Anna also thoughtfully arranged for us to drop off at the airport. I love Holiday Inn Resort!

There is a bus at the entrance of the hotel, and it is very convenient to call online car-hailing everywhere. You can see the waves from the balcony of the sea view room. It is so pleasant to stay in the hotel during the day and go out in the evening. The swimming pool was originally surrounded by cobblestones with non-slip mats on them. The stones were hard to feet, and they were replaced with stone slabs overnight. The service is so considerate. Friends staying in Sanya Bay strongly recommend Holiday.

msg:It was the first time I took my 3-year-old child out for a long journey, and first came to the Holiday Inn in Sanya Bay. Before coming here, xhs watched everyone‚Äôs living experience every day. Finally, we arrived and stayed for 3 nights at first. We are very satisfied with this hotel. First of all, the service attitude is very good, from the check-in staff to the butler service Gao Zhi helped Make reservations for all parent-child projects that require reservations, travel photography, etc. And every time you ask something you don't know, the staff will reply patiently! Secondly, the air conditioners in the rooms in Sanya are relatively cool. We felt too cold on the first day of our stay, but there was a problem with the air conditioners that we couldn‚Äôt adjust them. After communicating with the housekeeper, they quickly adjusted the rooms for us. Everything in the hotel is based on children's feelings, and they will often ask us if they are worried about children's discomfort.
       I stayed in Yalong Bay for a day on the way. The hotel I chose was the best and the experience was too bad. I was afraid of stepping on thunder after I checked out temporarily, so in the end our partners who traveled together decided to go back to Holiday Inn Resort Sanya Bay.
       This time, due to a temporary change in the plan to book rooms, many rooms have been booked, so I can only book which room is available every day. After arriving at the front desk, manager Liu Jing helped us adjust the room uniformly, which was really convenient and we no longer needed to move our luggage back and forth.
       The food in the restaurant is clean, fresh and diverse every day to satisfy the different tastes of adults and childrenüëç
       This trip to Sanya met a good hotel‚ûïgood staff, which really added more beauty to the trip, thank you! I will choose to live here again when I come to Sanya~

       The hotels for the first four days of the journey have been arranged, and there is still no way to book for the last night.

It was June 1st that day, and I gave small gifts to the children. The hotel also specially planned the June 1st event, which was really thoughtful. We have to catch an early flight at 5:30 in the morning, and the hotel also packs breakfast, which is really considerate!
        I made an appoin**ent to take pictures at the hotel, and the photographer took pretty good pictures. I will give you 10 pictures, and the price of the extra 20 pictures is not bad~
        The sound insulation of the hotel is good, the lawn mower downstairs is rattling, and you can't hear it at all when you close the balcony door.
        It is recommended to live on a high floor if you want to see the sea view, because the trees are quite tall.

Facilities: The hotel has a children's club, a gym, a heated swimming pool, a climbing frame, a small train, etc. The hotel garden is a bit small but it faces the sea. It has a very good view at a glance. You can also see the swimming pool downstairs. Cross a small road and you will see the sea , There are a lot of free sand digging tools on the beach. There are few people and the waves are small, so it is very convenient
Hygiene: The room is very big, new and clean, it is the best I have ever stayed in, the hair dryer in the bathroom is very good, the balcony can dry clothes, and it also provides children's bathrobes, children's footstools, children's bathtubs, children's strollers, and children's toiletries. In short, it is too friendly for children.
Service: The housekeeper Anna, the restaurant Xiao Dong, and the girls in the kids club are all very, very good! Anna upgraded us to a C sea view room on the top floor, which is great! The staff here are very enthusiastic and the service attitude is very good. I really recommend it! The breakfast is also the richest in the hotel I have ever eaten!
The hotel's small train ride is free, and the lobby also provides free biscuits, iced tea, and lollipops. We are on an evening plane and the child has been sleeping in the afternoon. The lady at the front desk waited for the child to wake up before telling us to check out. At that time It was already 4 pm, and Anna also arranged a car for us to send to the airport for free, but we didn't catch up with the things we were looking for, and the hotel's travel photos were also very good, 10 free photos! Other hotels are 5. More than a charge of 20 yuan, other hotels are 38, and also provide clothing and simple makeup. I feel very good staying here!

msg:Very very very recommended! Holiday Inn Resort saved my vacation! The other hotels I chose on the first day were overturned, and they were all musty, which made me mistakenly think that all seaside hotels are like this. So at that time, with the idea of giving it a try, I set up a night to see the situation. Change it if it's not good! Unexpected, so good that I feel that this is my dream resort hotel! I also want to thank sophia for upgrading the room type for us. It is facing the swimming pool and the scenery is so good. So decisively renew the lease until the end of the final holiday! Thank you for such a good hotel and Sophia who is so responsible for making our team building journey so wonderful! There are many delicious places around the hotel. I recommend a seafood restaurant - the number one fishing port! The price is affordable and the taste is really good! !
Hotel environment: beautiful
Hotel service: I can only say that it is very good! !
Hotel hygiene: clean and tidy
Hotel facilities: very new!
Afternoon tea for two: Yes
15-95% discount on some products in CDF‚Äôs six stores in Hainan (applicable to some brands and single products in CDF‚Äôs designated stores): yes

There are many types of western style, but I feel that the service and sanitation can‚Äôt keep up with no one to help you collect tableware and garbage, even if you have piled up a mountainü§£ The Chinese restaurant will turn off the lights and tell you that it will close when the time comes. It‚Äôs like driving you away if you haven‚Äôt finished eating. I really need to improve. Thank you, manager Lily at the reception, for her warm service. She helped us upgrade the high-rise sea-viewing room and thoughtfully arranged the airport drop-off service. The room has a wide view and a beautiful, clean and warm bedding. The bedding is comfortable. I bought a package that includes accommodation and breakfast. A welcome fruit plate is mini once. Let‚Äôs have a lunch for two, a coconut chicken hotpot, and an afternoon tea for two. If you don‚Äôt want to go out, it‚Äôs enough to stay in the hotel.

There is a good breakfast and Chinese restaurant near the hotel called: Jia Ai Houan Soup Noodles (I am too lazy to go to the store, and the takeaway order is also very good. Beef fried Baoluo noodles are very good. The signature Houan noodles are also good)
The experience of staying in Yate on the last day is not as good as here, except that the room will be higher-grade than the holiday. It is basically difficult to take care of the service because there are too many people. It is not recommended to go to Yate to play in the water and see the underwater world. You can have it Better choice!

msg:I was very satisfied with my trip to Sanya during the May Day holiday this year. Before I went, I also looked for hotels on Xiaohongshu. I strongly recommend that you check the number of hotel rooms when choosing a hotel. Don't choose a hotel with too many rooms. Large-capacity hotels, no matter how high the star rating is, will also reduce the service quality if there are a large number of tourists staying during holidays. So I chose Sanya Bay Holiday Inn, and it turned out that my choice was too correct! The hotel contacted one day in advance to confirm the check-in situation, prepared children's sanitary ware and bathing supplies for the baby, and upgraded the room type when checking in. Surprise! The hotel has a lot of children's activities, with rich content in the morning and afternoon, and different surprises every day. It is very suitable for bringing children! The Sanya Bay Beach is just across the road from the South Gate. In the evening, after the sun sets, it is just right to take the children to dig crabs. You don't have to leave the hotel and experience a perfect holiday life. There is a Fenghe Plaza about one kilometer around the hotel, and it is quite convenient to eat and drink. If you don't want to leave the hotel, takeout is also very convenient. There is a ** takeout cabinet at the door of the hotel. The hotel butler Lucas Fu is considerate and responsive to requests during the few days of staying in the hotel. Five-star praise! Compared with other so-called Sanya baby-friendly hotels on Xiaohongshu, Sanya Bay Holiday Inn is sincerely recommended!

First of all, the room arrangement was very smooth when we checked in. The room type with a good view was upgraded for free, and welcome juice was given to the children during the waiting time, which was very considerate. The layout of the room is satisfactory, the view is very good, the hotel's Chinese restaurant and buffet breakfast are good, there is a barbecue buffet by the pool at night, I tried the dross vinegar hot pot, and put mosquito repellent water on each table thoughtfully. The details of this hotel are fine, the waiters are very enthusiastic, and it doesn't feel crowded during peak periods like May Day. Another particularly good thing is that there is an open-air constant temperature swimming pool, and you are not afraid of catching cold after swimming for a long time, and towels, floating boards, and swimming laps are all free of charge. The details are really good, and I am surprised. Crossing the zebra crossing is the beach. There are few people and quiet, suitable for sitting and relaxing. This is the most cost-effective hotel booked in Sanya, and the price is super high.

I really mind the smell of the hotel, especially the musty smell, but this one really has no smell at all. I especially like the service. I contacted me the day before check-in and asked me if I need to check in early. I also added the housekeeper‚Äôs WeChat. After arriving at the store, someone will help deliver the luggage. Needless to say, the service attitude of each service staff Alright, all very well! Because I stayed in other hotels in Yalong Bay before, there is no harm if there is no comparison. I would also like to thank the butler Gao Zhi for his thoughtful service and helping us make reservations for children's activities. Contact us and ask if you need a late check-out. When we learn that we have to catch a flight early in the morning, we also reserved breakfast for us.
It is especially recommended to bring children to stay here. There are plenty of parent-child activities, clean swimming pool, bubble party and indoor children's playground. We only stayed for two nights and returned. It's really a pity, regret it They should all live here, because the baby said, "Mom is so reluctant." In addition, the breakfast is also very rich, and there is also a breakfast area for children. Next time you come to Sanya, you must arrange this hotel!
I really feel good to evaluate, recommend to everyone~

The hotel staff are very friendly to children and will help take care of them. The swimming pool is double-layered and has two constant temperatures.

When I booked this hotel, I booked for 1 night at the beginning, and I was afraid of stepping on thunder and dared not try to book once a few days. As a result, the experience was very good after staying for one night, and another night was added the next morning.
1. The hotel is relatively new, 2 tea drinks are provided, and the check-out is delayed until 2 pm; 2. Ms. Lu Shuxie at the front desk is very enthusiastic, and I give you a thumbs up! 3. There are a lot of children's activities in the hotel. Little Treasure took a small train, played egg grabbing, foam fight in the swimming pool, and painted oil paintings. The overall swimming pool is also more suitable for families with children traveling. After staying for more than two days, I basically soaked in it. The hotel took the baby to play. 4. Breakfast and lunch are good, and the hotel's lunch and dinner meals are not expensive. 5. The overall sanitation is very good; 6. There are many places to eat nearby, and the lady at the front desk also recommended them. 7. The beach is across the road, which is convenient for beach visits;
8. Temporarily decided to take a travel photo of the hotel. Haitang Bay is 30 per photo. After the hotel sends 10 photos, the overall price is much cheaper than Haitang Bay.
In short, it is worthy of five-star praise, and I will stay here next time

The baby came and said wow, and told me many times that I wanted to play for another day before going home, but I was helpless temporarily. It was hard to find another room, so I had to promise to come back in a few months and just stay in the hotel. Anna, the personal butler, is also very considerate. She saw that a baby was directly upgraded to a better room when she checked in. After checking in, she clearly informed the hotel of various parent-child activities, and actively helped to make appoin**ents and remind time slots, because she only stayed for one day. Help communicate and negotiate to make an appoin**ent for expedited shooting time and film selection for travel photography. Recommend surrounding restaurants and help arrange free airport drop-off after late check-out, because it is the last stop of the itinerary, we only stayed for one day but the whole process was meticulous, which made us feel the best service. Objectively speaking, the hotel is not too big, the hardware is not the most luxurious, and there is no private sand, but the hotel positioning is very clear, parent-child and service! The details are very thoughtful, for example, the concierge has prepared baby strollers that are of the Goodbaby brand, and there are lollipops and biscuits that children like in the lobby! This is really suitable for families with children, especially babies at the end of age. There are rich parent-child activities, free naughty treasures, outdoor play facilities and activity rooms, whether it is a private butler, front desk staff or concierge, they are all very polite and friendly. Breakfast is targeted at children's meals and baby tableware, especially for babies. The bib is very thoughtful. In the past, Best Westin, although there were parent-child activities, but the young children had almost nothing to do except the pool slide, and they didn't feel the service at all, so they really didn't even want to complain. Moreover, the hotel is very close to the airport. The drop-off bus booked by the housekeeper Anna is also small. The car is clean and comfortable, and the experience is very good. As the last hotel in the itinerary, the children really don‚Äôt want to leave. Although the sea in Sanya Bay is not It is very beautiful, but in Sanya on a cloudy day, no bay is spared. The seats prepared by the hotel allow people to listen to the sea blowing at that moment, which is extremely comfortable. In the future, only Holiday lnn Resort in Sanya!

When traveling with the elderly and children, we also specially arranged similar rooms. Although the mountain view room faces the airport, there is no sound at all when sleeping at night. If you are traveling with children, choose this hotel. There are many activities in the hotel and there is a heated swimming pool, which is very friendly to babies. You can also go to the beach to catch crabs at night, which is super fun!
Thanks to the little fairy Winnie for taking care of me~

msg:Facilities: very refreshing, very beautiful, everything is available. The warm pool is so refreshing, the children had such a great time playing in it that they didn't want to leave.
Hygiene: It is very clean, especially the swimming pool. You can see the staff cleaning by the pool every moment of the day, and someone will clean the fallen leaves as soon as you are free.
Environment: It is super close to the beach, just across the road, the beach coastline is very long, and there are no reefs, which is great! The beach is very lively, and the back door of the hotel is full of tree-lined roads, which is very comfortable to walk in. The shade is cool and suitable for a walk after dinner.
Service: Very satisfied. From the time we entered the hotel, there were staff members to help open the door and carry luggage. Then I would like to thank Ms. Hana Sun Shiyun, the hotel housekeeper who received us, she is kind and kind, and answers all questions. We arrived at the hotel early, not only helped us coordinate the room, checked in early, but also gave us a coupon for the water bar in the lobby, let us wait for a while, and knew that we were leaving very early the next morning, free of charge Help us upgrade the room type. Knowing that we have children and we have to catch the plane, he gave us breakfast so that we can leave Sanya full the next morning. When we left the next morning, there was a waiter at the door to pick up and drop off our luggage early in the morning. It was really a very, very good experience.
All in all, this is a great surprise trip. I have been living in Yalong Bay before, and I came to Sanya Bay. In fact, the main purpose is to be close to the airport, so that it is convenient to catch a plane. But the hotel really surprised me, whether it was the housekeeper, the service, or the environment, I was very pleasantly surprised. At one point, my wife and I had the urge to change our ticket, but due to our future schedule, we could only suppress this idea. In the past years in Sanya, I basically went straight to Yalong Bay and Haitang Bay. I think after this time, Holiday Inn Resort Sanya Bay will be the first stop of my trip to Sanya in the future.
By the way, the hotel restaurant is very rich and the price is reasonable. Although I didn't eat the seafood buffet, please don't miss the little brother who sings in the buffet area, he sings really well. The breakfast was also a surprise. The dishes are not inferior to the MGM we stayed at this time. Even my wife said that it feels richer than MGM and tastes good. Finally, I would like to thank Ms. Hana Sun Shiyun again, and look forward to meeting you again next time.

Before I went, I called several times to ask how far it was from the sea and whether there were many children‚Äôs projects. The hotel said with certainty: We are a parent-child hotel, and we went there half-believingly. As soon as we entered the lobby, there was a big dinosaur playing with the children, surrounded by children, and the baby was immediately attracted to it. When we checked in, we gave the baby stickers. Listen. We said we had to get up early to go to the airport, butler Lily packed breakfast for us, a bubble show, and a balance car fun race. Although it was only one day, the baby had a lot of fun, and the baby couldn't get enough of each project. The hotel's service is very considerate , not burdensome but just right, and very professional. The environmental sanitation is also relatively good. It is not a luxury hotel. After all, the price is here, but it is a very cost-effective parent-child hotel

In addition, I would also like to thank the hotel housekeeper Fu Dunming for his thoughtful service. Finally, let me say that our room is facing the airport runway. Phoenix Airport is very busy in the early morning and the noise is relatively loud, but the sound insulation effect of the sliding door in the room is very good. The bad thing is that there is no charging pile in the hotel, and the tram needs to be charged two kilometers away. Finally, let me say that Sanya Bay is much better than Haitang Bay, and the beach in Haitang Bay is messy.

2. The buffet in the morning is very rich, there are children's tableware, children can find suitable food, and there are not too many people to make people feel uncomfortable, but there are too many people in Haiyun, and the tables are very slow to be cleared during peak dining hours.
3. Children's swimming equipment and sand digging tools can be borrowed for free, praise.
4. The experience of using the children's playground and the small train is very good. We all play multiple times a day.
5. There are quite a lot of parent-child activities. When we were young, we only participated in painting activities, as well as making cakes, sushi, pizza and other activities. The older children can participate in balance car competitions, find eggs, etc., and go to the beach after 5 o'clock every day Moving to find sand crab activities. The eleventh picture is the daily activities.

There are various climbing facilities in the courtyard, as well as a small trainüöû, you must sit down. very interesting
The swimming pool is very clean, and the staff are always there, very reassuring. Swimming rings and beach toys are borrowed free of charge.
The room style is simple and comfortable, and the balcony is very convenient to dry clothes

I couldn‚Äôt stay on the balcony because the abandoned building opposite was under construction during the day. My strange room There is also an escape door, and there are outdoor stairs outside. I can see the airport from the stairs. Except from 1:00 to 6:00 at night, the sound of the plane surrounds the stereo at other times, accompanied by the sound of the construction site. Don't even think about taking a good rest during the day.
The male receptionist at the front desk for check-in and check-out has always been sullen, and is impatient to answer questions.
The sanitation of the hotel is very good, and the swimming pool is also very good.
Breakfast was really nothing to eat.

msg:The hotel that was the least expected of this trip gave me the biggest surprise. It is very cost-effective and feels like a relaxing vacation. I stayed in Phuket, Thailand once before. This time I thought it was close to the airport, and Sanya Bay also experienced it. I didn‚Äôt expect to live here. When I didn‚Äôt want to leave, the experience was second-hand. I stayed at a hotel in Haitang Bay and Yalong Bay that was several times the price. The staff had a very good sense of service. The housekeeper Fu Dunming answered every question, and the WeChat reply was very timely. The heated swimming pool is very kid-friendly, and the kids had a lot of fun. The bubble pool parties are all free. Just across the road is the beach, and the quality of the beach is also very good. It's really a seriously underrated hotel. Overall, I'm very satisfied with my stay. In the future will continue to choose

It's very cool~ and children's swimming rings can be played casually, and it's good to put them back after playing, unlike five years ago, Xi Moudun had to pay for rent... Although there is a road to go to the beach, it is a very narrow road On the road, it only takes one minute (feeling) from the room to the beach, which is more convenient than many five-star hotels with private beaches~ The beach is also very delicate, taking pictures in the morning and evening is like a movie~ The hotel is super friendly for family trips, activities It is very rich, and the bubbles at 5 pm are the children's favorite~ There is also a sand crab digging activity at 6 o'clock. Although it is not a private beach, there will be waiters on the beach who provide free chairs and children's sand digging tools at fixed times. ~ The room is quite new, very high-grade, very clean, and there is a Dyson hair dryer, and you can see the sea from the third floor above ~ The hotel service is also quite good, all the staff are polite and quick to respond, especially the housekeeper Arlen, Very considerate, I even gave my baby a very cute little rabbit when I left~ The Chinese restaurant is also very cost-effective. For home cooking, the per capita is about 125. You can have vegetables and soup, which is very delicious~ My parents said they would come again~

What is particularly worth recommending is that the back door leads directly to Yemeng Corridor Beach, and there is also a running trail. I ran 7 kilometers along the trail in the early morning, and then came back along the coastline. It was so cool.

Booked a mountain view (free upgrade to sea view), two nights on weekends, 1209, used 1200-600 coupons, 609, really made a lot of money, including breakfast, carpool pick-up, small train (did not take it), travel photography (Not photographed). The day before I left, I made an appoin**ent at the front desk to go to the duty-free city at 9 o'clock on the last day. Because the return trip in the afternoon was after 13 o'clock, and I was afraid that I would not be able to catch up with the check-out time, the lady at the front desk took the initiative to postpone it until 15 o'clock. In the end, because I liked the hotel so much, I didn‚Äôt go to the duty-free shop and went running and swimming instead.

Be sure to get a sea view room, the view is superb.

Facilities: Very new and brightly decorated
Hygiene: Very good! The bed was very clean and comfortable
Environment: Awesome! I haven't left the hotel for three days and two nights, just staying there
Service: exceeded expectations!

1. When checking in, a young man wearing glasses at the concierge (forgot to ask his name) took the initiative to pick up my luggage and helped me carry my luggage to the room after I checked in. It was very nice! George at the front desk was very friendly and took the initiative to upgrade me to a select ocean view room! They also took the initiative to introduce the Chris**as light-lighting ceremony in the evening! Good reviews throughout!
2. I added the housekeeper Alice‚Äôs WeChat account. The day before departure, she took the initiative to ask about arrangements for airport drop-off. It was free of charge. On the day of departure, it was a seven-seater business car, which was very good!
3. I called the service center several times and they were all very friendly and answered proactively.

Breakfast: very good! Rich variety and deliciousüòã! Not inferior to a five-star hotel.
Afternoon tea for two: OK! The coffee given by the little brother is great! The resident singer's selection of songs was top-notch, and they were all my favorites. I just lay down in the lobby bar for two hours to listen to the songs and have afternoon tea!
Sightseeing train: I didn‚Äôt ride on this one, but it was quite cute.

There are also many children staying here, and many playmates. My son‚Äôs watch has added a lot of friends. After leaving In a few days, I also received invitations from children to play.
Thank you for upgrading the hotel room and sending fruits and snacks (but the premise is that the luggage cart was broken and hit our carüòÇ)
The hotel is generally small and recently renovated, but the facilities do not match the price. The quality of toilets, basins, showers, etc. is very poor (compared with the old hotels of the Sanya Central Crown Group, these facilities are several grades worse, and the price is over there At least twice as much or more) The design of the bedside lamp is also very tasteless, easy to bump into each other, and get in the way.
For breakfast, I don't think this year will be good, there are too many main people, and my husband thinks this is the most suitable for him.
Service: The service consciousness of the staff is very good.

Originally, the house supply was tight during the Chinese New Year period, but in the end, I helped me coordinate and upgraded to a sea view room, which was a pleasant surprise.
The hotel has added a lot of children's programs, and there are 2 constant temperature pools among the 5 swimming pools. The children had a lot of fun during the 3 days of their stay. The hotel also placed some chairs and beach entertainment tools (volleyball, sea catching gadgets, etc.) on the beach for guests to use. The staff member who taught the children to catch sand crabs was very humorous, and the children liked him very much.
The doorman of the hotel is very active and enthusiastic to help with the luggage, and will be courteous to the guests when entering the elevator. The details are well done. Ms. Sophia at the front desk received us very gently and meticulously, thank you. The breakfast may be open until 11:00 due to the peak season. It is very user-friendly and has more varieties than before. In the morning, you can see the staff cleaning the swimming pool; when the swimming pool is open, life jackets are very responsible, reminding swimmers to pay attention to safety. At the end of the stay, I also received a call asking about the experience of staying in the hotel. I learned about our flight at night and helped us to delay check-out until 2 pm. Thank you Manager Huang.
All in all, I am very satisfied with this stay, and my family likes it very much. Although the hotel is not big, the facilities are well maintained and the service is very good. Next time I come to Sanya Bay, I will choose to stay at Holiday Inn Resort Sanya Bay.
I hope that in the future, the hotel can provide more sports facilities (such as table tennis, billiards, etc.), which would be even better.

msg:I have been to Sanya many times. This is the first time I stayed at a Holiday Inn in Sanya Bay. Before choosing a hotel, I checked the ratings from Ctrip. To be honest, it‚Äôs really hard to say if the score is below 4.6. This hotel has a score of 4.8, which is really high in Sanya Bay. There are not many, so I tried to live once, and it feels good! First of all, I booked an ordinary room. The front desk said that facing the impact of the airport, you can upgrade to a pool view room if you register as a member (free of charge). Although it is on the first floor, because the hotel is on a high terrain, the first floor is equivalent to the second floor. Children play in the swimming pool. Standing on the balcony, I can see clearly. The environment is good. The room is large. At the same time, the first floor is very high, so I feel that the room is even bigger. Although I can‚Äôt see the sea, I think it‚Äôs okay to stand on the balcony when the sea is around during the day. Keep looking at the sea! Members also gave a welcome drink or wine, and a large plate of fruits and desserts in the room (the macaron in the photo has already eaten two, but it is actually more than the photo üòÄ), like it! There are many breakfast styles, the outdoor swimming pool is very large, some children's water toys are free, and the electric floating board is 98 yuan for 15 minutes, which is a bit too expensive. More people will experience it with half the cost and longer time. It is worth learning from other hotels in terms of check-out. When I checked in, the front desk said that the check-out could be delayed appropriately. I actually checked out the room at 2:00 or 3:00 (the requirement was before 12:00), and there was no urging from the waiter or the front desk. It‚Äôs true that everyone thinks it‚Äôs unreasonable to check out at 12 o‚Äôclock. It‚Äôs really a bit embarrassing for you to ask people to check out at 12 o‚Äôclock, but more than 90% of the hotels This requirement, this point of his homeüëçüëçüëç. Some suggestions and small comments, first, the members who check in have a welcome drink or wine, and the guests without members and those who check out some take a temporary rest in the lobby. If there is a concierge, they can take the initiative to pour a glass of water, just water That's all, it feels more intimate. Of course, there is free water in the lobby that you can pick up yourself, but what I saw was that there was no water in it. Second, very few hotels now charge a deposit, and I booked it with Ctrip. Although it is not more than 500 yuan, I still feel that the experience is slightly poor. Of course, this is not a shortcoming. In Sanya, which is a peak tourist season, the price of 1,300 yuan is more expensive, but it is in line with the overall price level, and there is no excessive price increase! The overall feeling is very good!

msg:This is my first time in Sanya, staying at Holiday Inn Resort Sanya Bay, the experience is very good. There are outdoor swimming pools in the hotel, which are relatively shallow. It is a paradise for babies to play in the water during the day. Next to the swimming pool, there are swimming rings, towels, etc. provided by the hotel free of charge. Opposite the hotel is the Coconut Dream Corridor and the seaside, and there are also sand dredging tools provided by the hotel on the beach. The travel photography provided by check-in needs to be reserved one day in advance.
The ground parking space is limited, and the ba*****t parking space is sufficient. If you just park in the ba*****t, you need to take the elevator to the first floor, walk a few steps to the hotel lobby, and then change the elevator back to the room. Stayed in the sea view room, the scenery is beautiful and comfortable, praise.

msg:The third hotel in Sanya came to Sanya Bay during the Spring Festival holiday. It feels good. The main reason is that there are too many people during the Spring Festival. There are relatively few people in Sanya Bay. This holiday hotel is just across the small road to the beach. The children had a great time playing.
Thanks to Xiaoyue (Arlen) for her careful arrangements and taking the trouble to answer my questions. Thanks to Zhang Yiling from the housekeeping depar**ent for her careful cleaning (it would be nice if she practiced her handwriting more beautifully haha)
Special thanks to Liu Jing at the front desk, very professional! There is a leadership style at a glance! Answer some of my things in seconds! Including buying fruit outside the hotel. Great!
During the Spring Festival, the price still rose quite sharply, but the price/performance ratio of this holiday is still good! In the future, I will strive to take team tours with colleagues from the unit, and live here too!

msg:For so many years, I have come to Sanya almost every January. This is the first time I have lived in Sanya Bay for 3 days. Sanya Bay has little wind and waves, and the beach is beautiful. Going out of the hotel is the Coconut Dream Corridor, which is the seaside. The children's pools are heated and there are lifeguards everywhere. I booked a family room with a sea view. The room is very spacious, with a double bed and a single bed. The family lives very comfortably. Alice, the housekeeper, is very nice and responded to all kinds of questions in a timely manner. In such a tight season, she also helped us with late check-out. It was a great convenience for our family with the elderly and children to catch the 5:00 p.m. flight. When I left the store, my watch was left in the hotel, and the plane was about to take off. I found out that I called the hotel, and the hotel staff quickly helped to find it and sent it to me. The hotel also has an airport drop-off service, which is very convenient. It is recommended for friends who choose Sanya Bay to choose this hotel.

By the standards of a five star hotel, it would be disappointing.
1. Service: The front desk service is not bad, but there are too many service slots during the stay. 1) There was no one at the bar counter, we waited for 20 minutes for the service staff to show up. 2) The waiter delivered things to the room, and did not ring the doorbell when entering the room. It was embarrassing to come out just after taking a shower. 3) There are napkins on the floor for breakfast, but the waiter didn't pick them up after passing by many times, see picture 1/2/3.
2. The bathrobes in the suite rooms are severely worn (see Figure 4 and 5). Can the bathrobes in five-star hotels be replaced if they are damaged?
3. The travel photography contracted by the hotel is the worst among so many hotels. The photographer said that the hotel does not allow photographers to shoot in the hotel, so the location can only be a public seaside. Amateur level, after taking photos, there is no link of uploading to the computer to select the photos, just making selections in the camera. A total of 10 cards were given away, but it was found that there were no 10 cards to choose. If hotel travel photography cannot be used as a value-added service, it is recommended to cancel it directly, which will greatly reduce the impression score.

Through this experience, I can only say that I never want to live in Holiday Inn again.

msg:In the last week of 22 years, I went to Sanya and changed my job~
We chose Holiday Inn ~ the whole accommodation experience of 5 days and 4 nights really gave me a big surprise. I personally don't like the noisy hotel's location. I like it very much. First, the hotel is very close to the airport. Second, you can go to the beach in 5 minutes from the hotel. And the beach where the hotel is located has relatively few people, which is very suitable for us. The overall facilities of the second hotel are very complete. Although the decoration style is not extremely luxurious and high-end, the overall is very simple, clean, simple and natural. Third, the service of the hotel. Every staff member I met in the hotel is very nice, and I feel that their sense of belonging is very strong. Therefore, the trea**ent of customers is not a sloppy service, but a genuine enthusiasm, kindness and warmth, without going too far. I like this feeling very much. Fourth, restaurants, compared to the high prices of various seafood market restaurants in Sanya. The holiday Chinese restaurant can be said to be a breath of fresh air. If you want to eat some seafood simply, the set meal at 398; is just right for 2 people. The key is that the Chinese restaurant in the hotel tastes really good~ Different people have different opinions~ I recommend everyone to try it. The breakfast provided in the morning buffet area is also very rich. Finally, although I am very wordy, I still have to say that the hotel's swimming pool and other facilities basically meet the needs of most people ~ the water is also very clean. Every day at 5 o'clock in the afternoon, there will be a wave of foam rain~ I can see the children playing very happily. In short, everything here is a very good experience~ everything here matches very well in terms of price, service, facilities, and transportation convenience. Finally, I would like to give a thumbs up to the young lady at the front desk~ She still tried her best to help us choose a suitable room when we checked in during the peak season when the room types were in short supply. Book a drop-off for us. All in all I am very satisfied with everything here.

The sea view room has a good view, and the family room also has a small tent. The hotel is very close to the beach, just a few minutes walk to the beach.

In addition to the outdoor swimming pool, the hotel also has two heated swimming pools, where people who are afraid of the cold can also soak in the water.

The coffee shop next to the lobby invited a resident singer who is very good at singing, lying on the sofa and blowing the sea breeze, listening to live, it is also very romantic
The swimming pool outside is very big and nice to see and take pictures, suitable for families with children

The first-line sea view, I opened the window and saw the magnificent sea, which made me amazed. The distance to the beach is just a few steps away. I didn't expect the sea view here to be so beautiful, which left a deep impression on me. Let's talk about the guest room environment here. The hotel is not big, so it doesn't go around like other hotels, and you can't find your way. The floor of the stairs is shiny and shiny, and it can be seen that they are doing hygiene with great care. There is a conch next to each house number. It is unique. The items in the room are neatly arranged, and the air conditioner has been turned on in advance. Knowing that we are traveling on a honeymoon, they even made a honeymoon layout for us, which is very detailed. Very pleasantly surprised, the check-in experience was great.
Transportation: It is relatively close to Nanshan Cultural Park, Tianya Haijiao, West Island, and Tianya Lanbai Town. It takes only ten minutes to drive to Fenghuang Airport, so it is convenient to get in and out.

Service: Before the car arrived at the entrance of the lobby, there was a concierge waiting for us. When our car arrived, he opened the door and greeted us as soon as possible. When we learned that we were checking in and had luggage, we immediately took the luggage to the front desk. He brought us a welcome drink from the hotel, which was ice cold and delicious, and there were free cookies. The person who checked in at the front desk was a young lady in white clothes. Before we even got to the front desk, she greeted us with a smile. She was very patient when she checked us in. Because of the changes in the epidemic situation, she asked a lot of related questions and explained them patiently to us. That kind of impatient feeling, after check-in, I also added the WeChat of the lady at the front desk, it was our little butler Anna, and the concierge Wang Hongyu sent us to the room, and introduced us to many places to eat, drink and have fun on the way. The experience is very good, and there will be no hidden consumption.
Facilities: The hotel is relatively new, with new equipment and facilities. The towels and bath towels are very skin-friendly, so you won‚Äôt feel any discomfort when using them. The cups and utensils in the room are clean and spotless. The bed is big and soft, as is the sofa. and free minibar
Afternoon tea for two: The complimentary afternoon tea in the package is delicious, the small cakes inside are delicious, no less than some desserts I ate when I was on a business trip abroad, the coffee is also delicious, with moderate sweetness, and the latte art is very good .
Duty-free shop shuttle bus: There is also a shuttle bus to the Haitang Bay duty-free shop every day, which saved us a lot of taxi fares.
Swimming pool: The swimming pool here is surrounded by coconuts, especially at sunset, swimming at dusk when it is late has a special mood.

msg:I booked a two-night package at this hotel for my husband's birthday, and I came here because of the good reviews. On the first day, the customer service took the initiative to call to confirm the phone, and carefully asked if there were any special requirements. On the day of check-in, the customer service took the initiative to welcome us to help with luggage and serve drinks, making us feel at home. Relatively few guests from the epidemic checked in quickly, and the room was upgraded for free. The moment the door was opened, the words "Happy Birthday" were placed on the bed, and a large bowl of fruit was also given. At night, a beautiful little cake was also given. Chun, sir is so touched! Open the balcony door of the upgraded room, and look around: there is a super large and clear swimming pool nearby, and the blue sea and blue sky in the distance, the beauty is intoxicating! There are also two geothermal bubble pools beside the swimming pool, which are delicious for swimming and sleeping. The restroom has everything that one expects to find is branded, and the lighting is comfortable and just right. The ingredients for the breakfast buffet are fresh and delicious, and the desserts are the same for two days. By the way, the hotel also specially added Alisa WeChat, who will accompany you throughout the process and respond to your needs. It is a reminder that the hotel provides free nucleic acid testing every day, which is very convenient and relieves the worries of testing. The back door of the hotel is the seaside, and the Coconut Dream Corridor is in this area.
As far as the shortcomings of the hotel are concerned, the sound insulation of the room is slightly lacking. In the morning, I don't know if it is the next door or the upstairs who frequently flushes the toilet. Furthermore, the corners of the flower pond in the lobby are hard, and when I walked past the edge and touched it with my hand, it became a pimple. I hope that it will be soft wrapped as soon as possible to remove potential safety hazards, so as not to bump heads with children passing by.
I have stayed in many hotels in Sanya. Compared with the hotels with different prices, the service of this hotel is also five-star. I am very satisfied and it is worth staying again. üòäüåπüåπ

Sophia at the front desk contacted me in advance, consulted my preferences and the number of occupants, prepared an extra pair of slippers for me, and also arranged the room and sent fruit. And the little biscuits, knowing my birthday, they also gave me a cake, and also enjoyed the hotel drop-off and pick-up, very thoughtful, sophia is really caring. There are fruit tea biscuits and candies in the lobby that can be eaten. When I checked in, I kept my mouth hahaha. When I sent a message to Sophia, she always took the trouble to reply to me, and when I checked in, she introduced the time and place of the hotel business area to me in detail. . We stayed in a sea-view room. The bedding in the room was very clean and the view was very pleasant. We need to take anti-mosquito measures to walk around the park. After all, it is necessary to take anti-mosquito measures in Hainan's climate. The swimming pool is also very clean, and I often see the waiter. Cleaning up the leaves, although there are fewer waiters and fewer tourists, the service has not left anything at all, which is really good. The environment of the restaurant is also very good, the breakfast has a wide variety, hygienic and affordable, and the most important thing is delicious! Highly recommend this store. All in all, I am very satisfied with this hotel. I have rarely been so satisfied with a hotel that I can rate it five out of five. Really recommend! ! !

1. When you get off the bus in the lobby, there will be a concierge to help you open the door and take your luggage (as a four-star hotel, it is very good)
2. Check-in at the front desk is very fast. Sun Shiyun Hana at the front desk is not only a good-looking person, but also has a sweet voice and is very enthusiastic. When checking in, the room and daily necessities will be arranged according to the situation of our family. Very nice!
3. I heard that it is a new train from the hotel. Children like it very much, and there are many parent-child activities in the hotel, which are very good.
4. There are many varieties of breakfast, and the taste is also good
5. The rooms are very clean, they will help to clean and replace the toiletries every day, and the waiters are also very friendly
6. The hotel is not far from the airport. It is very convenient. It is also very close to the beach. Just cross the road. (Special thanks to Sun Shiyun for reminding us of the time to watch the sunset)

In general, this trip experience is very good. Is it very good to eat, drink, play and stay? I will choose to stay at the Holiday Inn next time when I come back (hope that the beauty is still there)

This time, I brought my son to play together. Since the plane arrived at 6:00 pm, I booked a hotel in Sanya Bay. I originally wanted to book a Pullman, but it has been open for too long. This is the latest one, so I chose a resort hotel. .
The location is very convenient, just across the road from the beach, too close. Although there are not many shops around, but you can search on the public comment, many of them can be delivered and delivered, the hotel also has a restaurant, and it is very convenient to take out and so on. Great for a hotel
The selected sea view special room this time, the high floor will be very good, we are on the 3rd floor, most of the trees are covered, and I also responded to the housekeeper, if the high floor should be able to see very comfortable.
Not to mention the facilities, it's great, except that the water spray in the bathroom is too far, the whole house is wet, everything else is great, sleep is also comfortable, this room size is quite big, children also have fun
Breakfast is slightly inferior to Marriott. There are many types but not many choices, but it is enough, and my son is happy to eat. Although there are not many desserts, I think it is a good thing. I don‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs not good to eat too much, so instead of taking any cakes and bread this time, I gave him a lot of corn and fruit. I added that my son thinks the fried rice is delicious, and he made it by himself, which is very special.
There are several swimming pools, which are very dry from early on, so I can only find corners, but my son is very happy, and it is very suitable at night. There are also outdoor ones. There is a saying, "Although the sparrow is small, it has all the internal organs." It is suitable for business or couples stay.
It is especially worth mentioning that the service is very good. The housekeeper contacted us in advance to inquire about the needs. The room was ready to check in as soon as the room arrived. After checking out, I learned about some unsatisfactory places and even sent us a small gift. I will stay here next time. .

The hotel is right by the sea, and the beach is just outside. There are hotel service staff on the beach, providing free children's sand digging tools and pure water on the beach. The front desk room and catering service staff are very enthusiastic. I think it is the best in Sanya Bay at the same price. Absolutely great value. I have come from Wanning and Lingshui all the way. The accommodation is not the most expensive, but I feel the best.

Personally recommend staying in Sanya for the last night after having fun, this is a good choice because it is close to the airport.

Thanks to the hotel for helping to upgrade the pool view room. The pool view is located on the corner of the second floor. You can see the pool when you look out from the balcony.
The hotel sent two people's own afternoon tea for free, and the variety was pitiful and not delicious. 3 people travel, 1 person pays 58 yuan at their own expense, not worth it!
The elevator in the underground parking lot cannot directly reach the lobby, and it feels like the underground parking lot is being renovated.
The price of 958 is booked, and the overall feeling is not worth it.
The room service and the service of the hotel staff are very good and very friendly.

The room is also very warm, the hotel sent afternoon tea and fruit plate. The management of the pub is in place, and I like it when I see someone checking the hygiene situation!
The back door of the hotel is right across the road, but the kids prefer the hotel's pool.
The breakfast is very good, but the dinner is a bit slow, and the lobster set is very good!
The hotel is very close to the airport, because it is a flight at 9:30 in the morning, there is no delay in going to the airport after breakfast. (I also went to the airport to pick up the goods duty-free). The airport free bus at 7 o'clock is not very human, because breakfast only starts at 7 o'clock...
There seems to be a duty-free shop bus.
Andy, the room housekeeper, is very attentive and always answers no matter how many nights it is.
Overall, I am very satisfied. Next time I come to Sanya, I will stay at the Holiday Inn directly, and I will not change to live there again.

On the day we arrived, the typhoon came, and the flight was delayed by an hour (compared to the cancellation of all flights due to the arrival of the typhoon the next day, the flooding of Sanya Airport, and the fact that there were many stalled cars on the highway).
The room is 46 square meters, because there is no bathtub, the area is quite large, and there is a large balcony with sea view. The hotel's garden and swimming pool are slightly smaller, but there are not many people. The mattress is too soft, the hotel provides a variety of pillows to choose from.
The key point is to mention the hotel service. The waiters are very enthusiastic. They will greet you at the meeting, and respond quickly if you need it. Although the Chinese restaurant in the hotel is not big, the dishes are delicious, so we stayed in the hotel for three days, and the three meals a day were all served by the hotel, and we didn't eat any dishes that stepped on the pit. On the day I left, I specially applied for a late check-out and went to have a coconut chicken hot pot. The restaurant has preferential packages, and the price is still very cheap, about 100 per capita to get it! Coconut chicken hot pot, Mapo tofu, and brine platter are all delicious. The polong in the polong package has a normal taste and no bright spots. Restaurant service is also very good. The restaurant manager and service staff are very enthusiastic and impressed.
Based on this price, the value for money of Holiday Inn Sanya Bay is too high, very close to the people! üëç

The only regret is that in the rainy day, I didn't see the beautiful sea view of Sanya Bay... Nothing, I will stay here next time

The room facilities are very new, especially the rainforest shower, which is very comfortable to wash. The view of the sea view room is also very good, you can see the ship and the island in the distance.
Breakfast and lunch are good, the beef brisket is very delicious, and the restaurant girl is also very cute and enthusiastic.
Although the afternoon tea in the lobby bar is nothing special, the resident singer is very good, and the selected songs are also very suitable for relaxing on vacation.
Finally, praise the service. Although the upgraded sea view room is not very quiet, the solution and attitude of the front desk meet the five-star standard.

This time, I spent half a month in Sanya and stayed in Haitang Bay all the time. On the last day, I had to leave by plane. Since it was a late flight, I chose to take a holiday. The family room was booked. The lady at the front desk saw that I was a member and upgraded the family room with sea view for free. Entering the room, it was a pleasant surprise. The view of the room is no worse than the sea view room in Haitang Bay. Besides, the hotel's parent-child activities are also very rich, and the breakfast is also very rich, which is no worse than the five-star hotel in Haitang Bay! It was raining the next day, so I had to delay the check-out until 2 o'clock. I called the front desk, and it was delayed by another hour! So impressed! Book a room and get afternoon tea! Next time you come to Sanya, you must stay for a few more days.

There are many mosquitoes in the south, and I have a physique that attracts mosquitoes. My entire right leg was bitten by large and small bags (the family members who lived with me were not a big problem). I called in the middle of the night, and the room service immediately sent toilet water. Full marks for service.
Overall, the rooms here are newer and cleaner, the beds are relatively drier, the swimming pool and restaurant and the children's playground are very good.
In addition, the transportation is very convenient. The bus in front of the door goes directly to Nanshan Temple and Tianya Haijiao, West Island and Tianya Town, which is highly praised.

The facilities are newer, the pool is amazing, the beach is beautiful (fine sand). There is a food city nearby, it is also convenient to order takeout, and the quality of the dishes in the hotel's Chinese restaurant is also good. The hotel's breakfast is rich, especially the variety of cakes and breads. When swimming, the waiter will put the cut watermelon next to the beach chair for the guests to relieve the heat. I would like to like this detail. Other services are also basically responsive. Three small suggestions: 1) There will be guests smoking by the swimming pool from time to time, which will affect the health and feelings of other guests. It is recommended to have a reminder mechanism. 2) Can there be a bar/drink bar on the top floor with sea view? 3) Can the coffee machine for the breakfast buffet be changed to one that can make latte?

msg:First of all, I am a person who is very reluctant to write bad reviews, but this store is really outrageous. Most of the good reviews should be brushed out! It's really bad. It doesn't match the corresponding rating at all. The Ctrip rating of this hotel is normally only below 4.5. I hope this review can help those who see it to avoid pitfalls. The content written is absolutely true!
First of all, the hotel's facilities and equipment are simple and can only reach the 3-star standard. The floor of the room is actually made of imitation floor tiles, which are very hard, and it is very slippery after taking a shower. Secondly, there is no door in the bathroom, and it is embarrassing to go to the toilet, especially if you are staying with children and the elderly, and there is no carpet in the aisle. Yes, judging from the cleanliness of the hotel, the plastic slippers cannot be cleaned and disinfected at all, and they will be used by guests again. Even if the furniture is damaged, it is simply repaired and put into use.
And the service is even worse. If there is 0 points, I won't even give 1üåü. I don't want to waste my time. I don't want to write the detailed content. I will have time to review it another day or provide other orders for your reference. Anyway, I have blocked it during the holidays, and I will never stay in this brand's hotel again.

After completing the formalities, I was told that I would be able to check in after cleaning up. When I came back after dinner at around 2 pm, I saw that some of the people behind me were able to check into their rooms, so I checked in. I asked the front desk to get a room. When I checked in, I was told to upgrade to a superior mountain view room. Who knew that as soon as I walked in, I was shocked that this was a mountain view room! ! ? I called the guest center and asked a lot but couldn't solve the problem. I was asked to call the front desk. The man at the front desk answered and said I would call back later. After waiting for fifteen minutes, I still didn't get a call. So I went straight to the front desk and didn't call. When changing rooms, why is it not clean? ? Normal check-out is at 12 o'clock, but it's been so long since cleaning and you still don't have a room. They told me that the upgraded room is located in the middle. With such a view, why don't I go a little further? Really speechless, five stars! ? I'm really glad I didn't book several nights in a row, what kind of gui service

msg:As an old tourist who comes to Sanya twice a year, why choose Holiday Inn? Summarized in one sentence: Although the sparrow is small, it has all the internal organs.
Transportation: It is close to the airport, far away from the downtown, convenient to take a taxi, and inconvenient for shopping.
The room is not high, but you can see the sea, and the night view is also beautiful. There are not many guests, so it is not crowded or scratched. Most of the waiters are okay. The front desk and the concierge can give praise (praise patience and initiative). The breakfast should be rich but not brilliant. If the requirements are not high, it will be rated 85 points. The points deducted are: the sound insulation is not very good, the echo in the corridor is heavy, and all the rooms have a loud closing sound. In addition, it is inconvenient to buy daily necessities (there is a small convenience store about 200 meters away from the back door).
There is a small heated swimming pool in the courtyard, children play mainly, and the water will be changed once to ensure the water quality. The large swimming pool is not constant temperature but the water is very clean. The staff supervises it all day and closes at 10 o'clock in the evening.
The hotel organizes small pot friend activities from time to time, small but interesting‚Ä¶
Figure 9 shows the beach at the back door of the hotel crossing the road. It is clean and fine sand, suitable for digging sand and playing in the water. This place is located in the western section of Sanya Bay. Compared with the lively section of the eastern section, this place is more suitable for quiet tourists.
Next time I come, I will choose this one in the area of Sanya Bay.

I like the design of the hotel the most. The room is big enough, the layout is very comfortable, and the design details are very reasonable. So it is comfortable to live in. When you open the door and see the big blue swimming pool, you will feel relaxed and happy~
The hallway through the hall like the lobby has a very holiday style ~ the most surprising is the design of the guest bathroom on the first floor ~ ingenious ~ I really like the tile material inside ~ the floor material of the hall is also well matched ~
It's also very convenient to go to the surrounding attractions~ There are many buses in front of the hotel~ You can get there~ Although I don't have a seat

The front desk came prepared, and specially prepared a paper form. It was very clear where to do it, what time to what time, and a few hours to report. So I took the nucleic acid according to the housekeeper's information (later the report was released within 12 hours, although it was different from the expected 8 hours, but the number of hospital tests has surged in the past few days, which is understandable). This makes us feel that the hotel is prepared for the needs of the guests and is more assured.
In addition, we were anxious to be able to get out of Sanya before further control (it turned out that it was indeed the global static on the 6th), so after the test report came out that night, we decided to go to the airport to try our luck. After entering the airport smoothly, contact the housekeeper, who will help us check out remotely and refund the deposit.
Let's talk about the hotel facilities, because I stayed for a short time, so I took a general look. This hotel is relatively new, the rooms are big enough, there are living areas and large balconies, and the beach needs to cross the road. Not far, people Not much. The swimming pool is sufficient and there are play facilities for children. We also played table tennis in it (free to borrow). As a guest who is rushing to the airport, it is very suitable, not only can it take ten minutes to the airport (6 kilometers), but also has the feeling of vacation.

The concierge depar**ent, Fu Guochen, will take the initiative to serve. If you have any questions, you can reply in time. It is also great to recommend nearby restaurants.

üöó Transportation: The underground of the parking lot is not directly accessible to the lobby
üßπSanitation: Sanitation is not bad, whether it is the room or every corner of the hotel
üçÉEnvironment: There are many swimming pools, there are also children's facilities, both inside and outside the city
üîîService: The overall service is good. The housekeeper Fu Guochen is very caring and active. The child lost one of his shoes, and he got feedback immediately after asking.
The overall value for money is very good, the breakfast is also very good, there are many types, the problem is that it is quite delicious, although the family garden view room is not high, the view is good, and it is not noisy. The balcony can dry clothes. The only dissatisfaction is to check in, because I brought a baby without an ID and did not bring the household registration book, but there is a social security card and an ID number. The younger brother who checked in was reluctant to say that he was found out during the epidemic. Those who want to go to jail also said that the social security card is not valid. Everyone at the big hotel that lived in Haitang Bay recognized it, and they were also very active in helping us solve the problem. This little brother would quarrel with us and let him go to jail. It really makes people feel bad. We also know that you can be stricter during the epidemic, but we are from a local non-epidemic area. Is this necessary? Except for check-in, we are very satisfied!

Our room is quite spacious, and you can see the coconut grove and the sea from the balcony. This is my favorite point. The room was very quiet, which may be the reason why there were few tourists when we went. The hotel is out to the sea, and walking is the Coconut Dream Corridor. The service is also good, and the butler who arranged for us is also very enthusiastic. These are advantages.

What I have to complain about is the hotel restaurant, the all-day restaurant is not open all day, and the environment is really dirty, messy, and flies everywhere. See the picture below. And it would take half an hour to order anything, or just not. Speechless üòì The hotel at this price should not be at this level of restaurant, it is not as good as the restaurant of the Express Hotel.

In addition, the hotel does not have a shuttle bus and will not help call a taxi. I didn't expect it.

msg:1. After looking at many hotels, I finally chose the Holiday Inn Resort Sanya Bay under the banner of InterContinental. After I checked in, I found that my choice was too wise! I think this is the most cost-effective hotel in Sanya Bay and Tianya District. Hotels that have been open for more than a year are usually my first choice. They are new but not decorated, and various facilities and processes and services will be smooth. Some old hotels with luxurious appearance and large area but outdated rooms will have a bad smell. This hotel is very friendly to my sensitive sense of smell.
    2. This is a hotel very close to the airport. To my surprise, I couldn't hear the sound of planes taking off and landing at a time regardless of day or night.
    3. The beauties at the front desk of the hotel are all smiles, check in and check out quickly and efficiently. The housekeeper Wang Hongyu was attentive and helped us carry the luggage and guide us to the room. All the employees I met here feel at home and well-trained, which is the most commendable point. In addition to the hardware of the star hotel, the soft service is also very important.
    4. All Amway must become IHG members. Members can check in with a welcome drink in the lobby, enjoy the room mini bar for free (although it is just Coke and Sprite haha~), and enjoy discounted room rates.
    5. The room has a sense of design, the lighting layout is also very user-friendly, and the power supply and sockets are easy to use.
    6. The bedding is clean and comfortable, and the pillows are soft and hard. The toiletries are more advanced, the shower gel is fragrant, the hot water in the shower room is quick, and the water drains quickly.
    7. The breakfast is sumptuous, and the waiter specially sent meticulously arranged snacks to IHG members. (If there is any need for improvement, it is recommended to add smoked salmon, Iberico pork slices, various cut cheeses, raw porridge with fresh ingredients in the hotel breakfast... These are the advanced breakfasts in my mind. If you adopt it, remember to notify me again. Ha~)
    8. The Balinese style outdoor garden is exquisite and compact, with a swimming pool and a hot spring pool. It doesn't need to be big, just enough for fun, the key is that there are not many people, and it feels exclusive.
    9. Just go out to the bus station, almost all the scenic spots can be reached. Buses drive along the coast no slower than Didi.
    10. Cross the road from the hotel to the beach and enjoy the blue sea and blue sky (the original pictures of all photos appear directly without any toning).
There are a few words and a list of the above, I hope to see the hotel better next time.

msg:üöó Transportation: 15 minutes by taxi from Phoenix Airport to the hotel. A few dollars.
üßπHygienic: The hotel is very new, the restaurant, rooms, toilets, swimming pools, gyms, and every corner you go to are very clean.
üçÉEnvironment: There are pictures and the truth. It‚Äôs the National Day. The hotel also has activities in the swimming pool. The bubble pool. The children are happy. In the evening, the restaurant above the pool opened a seafood buffet, and there is a small hot pot, which is very fresh It‚Äôs a pity that my kids don‚Äôt eat seafood and they don‚Äôt have the chance to taste it. I remember the price is 178 per person and 358 per person. After the swimming pool walks across the road, there is the beach, watching the sunset, digging sand is very good! The sand is very fine and can be launched into the water.
üîîService: Take a taxi to the hotel to check in. The one who received us is Xiao He butler, two words: thoughtful. Help us to pull the luggage, we still go to the room after check-in, and then help us connect to Wi-Fi to check whether the room facilities are complete. I want to make an appoin**ent for the shuttle bus to the duty-free shop. Xiao He took the initiative to contact us. Here again, I would like to thank Xiao He butler for taking care of us.
In addition to the above, let's talk about booking a free shuttle bus to the International Duty Free City. The taxi cost is more than 100. We check out and change to the hotel in Haitang District, take the free shuttle bus to the duty-free shop, and then take a taxi for 10 yuan to the hotel.
Summary: We stayed for two nights and didn‚Äôt have enough. This hotel is very new, very quiet, with few people, complete facilities, and high cost performance. I always feel a bit like Shangri-La. The bathroom supplies are of good quality. I have used them all. I usually bring it myself, this hotel can save it. Come again next time, I hope I can help everyone.
Suggestion: It would be better if there is welcome fruit on the day of check-in.

In the middle of the night, there was still a reception boy who helped with the luggage at the door, like it! As a result of the pandemic, tourists in Sanya have dropped sharply. This has also caused the hotel to have a luxury sea view at a price of 500 in the off-season. Xiao Sun at the front desk gave me two consecutive upgrades to become supreme. The room has a great view and the view is invincible. To be honest, if you don't go to other places, you will definitely continue to live, and give a suggestion to friends who are coming. Don‚Äôt decide the cheapest room type when you‚Äôre away. You can compare the lowest room type with the feeling of the president in your heart. Isn‚Äôt it a problem?

The linen in the room is generally average, the pillows and quilts are not very comfortable, the pillows have a relatively humid smell, and the overall hygiene of the room is still OK.
The breakfast was average, and the toppings on the noodle stall looked terrible. It didn't look like it was just made in the morning, and it was actually not delicious. The service attitude was even more average, and there were no wontons. The breakfast was indeed varied but not complete. A young lady gave corn soup and mango as a gift. I hope the hotel can unify the standard for breakfast service.
The swimming pool closes at 10 o'clock every night, and the water in the jacuzzi does not feel too clean at night, the temperature is about 28-29 degrees. The view from the room overlooking the entire pool is still great.
The check-in experience at the front desk is more convenient, the butler Fu Guochen's little brother has good service, and I recommend some restaurants.

This time I brought my mother and finally realized my wish. It was a very good experience. In the late hotel, the service staff helped me check-in in time after a busy schedule, and sent the elderly to the room to rest. The housekeeper Fu Weijie's service was even more intimate. He asked him about things at 1 am, and answered questions in time. Asked to send an elderly person to take a bath on the stool, butler Fu Weijie arranged it in time. It really felt at home and it was very warm. In addition, the location of the hotel is very good, facing the sea, the rooms are large, sitting on the balcony to watch and listen to the sea at night, cozy and romantic. Dining in the restaurant, the view outside the window is beautiful, in short, I am very satisfied with a stay.

üçÉEnvironment: I actually hesitated when I decided the hotel. There are many old hotels next to it, but considering that the opening time here is not long and the facilities should be updated, I finally decided to choose here. It turns out that the choice is not wrong, the room facilities are new, and the balcony view It's beautiful, you can see the sea, and it's very cost-effective. Going out from the back door and crossing the road is the seaside, very close. The back door of the hotel only opens at 8.9 o'clock in the morning. If you want to watch the sunrise in the morning, you have to go around the front door in a big circle, which is really inconvenient.

üßπSanitation: The room is clean and tidy. It will be cleaned up on time every day. I was worried about the presence of mosquitoes before. Fortunately, I didn't see any mosquitoes this time. The overall situation is very good. The water in the swimming pool will dye the white swimsuit blue. The hotel responds that it will use disinfection tablets to kill it regularly. It will not affect health. I hope so. But I still hope that the hotel can attract attention and serve as a public entertainment facility. , Safety, hygiene, and reassuring customers should be the first priority.

üîîService: The most worth mentioning is the service. The butler Fu Shangwei's little brother is enthusiastic, active, attentive and thoughtful, super extra points! Will choose here next time I come to Sanya Bay.

There are 4 swimming pools with different depths, suitable for children of different ages. It is also clean and not muddy, and the breakfast is very rich. The only drawback is that the elevator in the parking lot cannot go up to the lobby. It is said that it is under maintenance. I would like to especially thank Miss Zhang Yiling who helped me clean up the room. In addition to taking care of meticulous cleaning, we have a little more water demand with children. I hope to give us a few more bottles of water. She simply and straightforwardly travels to a whole box. Seeing that we were almost drinking, it was so sweet to change to a new box. There is also a housekeeper brother Fu Guochen. In addition to helping us carry our luggage, he also warmly recommends Sanya‚Äôs food, drink and fun. You must ask him to recommend it next time. ! ! !

msg:This trip to the three hotels in Sanya was the worst. For the last three days of the trip, I booked a family room here for InterContinental members. The sea view is not bad and it is close to the airport. But on the first day of check-in, I found small ants on the balcony. I didn‚Äôt care too much. The adults and children didn‚Äôt know what was being taken that night. After biting a large packet, we carried our own electronic mosquito coils, as well as incomparable drops. Then we sprayed mosquito repellent on our bodies before going to bed, but we were still bitten on the last night. The room did not see what the mosquito was supposed to be. , This kind of thing did not happen in the first two hotels. Crossing the road is a beach, but it is really dirty, there is a lot of rubbish in the sea, and there are red peppers floating üå∂Ô∏è. The swimming pool is not very clean. When I booked the room, I saw that there was a drop-off in the description. The night before I left, I asked the butler on WeChat if there was a car, but there was no reply. The next day I called to ask and said there was no car. We can take a taxi by ourselves, but the attitude of the hotel is very uncomfortable. This hotel will not come again for the second time. It is also owned by InterContinental. This one is not even worse.

This is the main reason why I booked at that time. The decoration is also very good. Although the floor of the hotel is not high, the sea view is still good. It is also very close to the sea. There is no need to cross the passage, just to cross the road, which is very convenient. The hotel has a relatively large swimming pool, and the children‚Äôs club is also okay, but there is a charge for handicrafts, and there are not many other entertainment items. The service is very good, and the breakfast is average. On the whole, the price is still very üâëÔ∏è, as Sanya Bay travel is still highly recommended. Although the hotel is not as famous as the other ones, I personally feel that it is more worthwhile to go regardless of its location or hardware.

The deluxe sea view room booked on holiday will be upgraded to a selected sea view room after arriving in the store. It is located in the middle of the top floor and has a great view of the sea, which is more beautiful than the luxury sea view room of Pullman! The swimming pool is also very big, and the children go swimming in the afternoon and evening. Although the overall scale is not as good as Pullman, it has everything it should and the facilities are very new. The service is also very good. I praised the housekeeper He and Zhao Yingmei for cleaning, and also prepared a small bottle of disposable disinfectant for us. Go to Tianya Haijiao for more than 10 minutes by car, go downstairs and cross the road for two minutes to the beach. The only thing that is not as good as Pullman is the beach. The sand is so thick that the children are resolutely reluctant to go to the beach once they go there.

msg:Because of this hotel, my one-month trip to Sanya has a terrible end. I have stayed in 7-star, 5-star and 4-star hotels and homestays before. Any of these hotels is better than this one because of Ctrip. As recommended by me, I chose this hotel well-received by many people to stay for two nights. As the last hotel on my trip in Sanya, I regret it now! In order to calm my mood and make a real comment, I wrote it after a month. At first I thought it was just the facilities and the hotel was a little smaller, but then it has developed to disturbing conditions. First of all, there is a lobby bar as soon as I enter the hotel. Here I have consumed it at night and during the day. However, when I was waiting for take-out during the day, it was less than 3 minutes. The service staff of the lobby bar I told me that I couldn‚Äôt sit there without spending, and I had to buy an afternoon tea set. There was no one there at the time. I deliberately didn‚Äôt sit in the viewing position and I didn‚Äôt sit in a reserved seat. I was just waiting for the takeaway. , Besides, here is why I didn‚Äôt choose a hotel restaurant to dine, because this hotel‚Äôs restaurant has limited business hours and is not open 24 hours or 12 hours, so many hotel guests order takeaways, which I haven‚Äôt seen in other hotels. Happening. Then after I left my seat in the lobby bar, I saw other guests with children in the lobby bar tumbling pillows in the lobby bar. No service staff came forward and told them that they would not be allowed to sit without spending. Is this treating guests differently? Then let‚Äôs talk about this afternoon tea for 138 yuan. I actually wanted to buy it, but then I found that the seat position of the promotional picture on the afternoon tea did not match the actual seat position. It was not at the pool at all. Is this false promotion? And I found some damp cigarettes in the green bag that I gave away in the closet of the hotel room. . . . Then I took care of it myself and threw it away. . . . In addition, the refrigerator in this hotel is not a refrigerator but a fresh-keeping box! ! ! If you don‚Äôt have a refrigerator, don‚Äôt write it in the facility. This is to deceive consumers. If it‚Äôs a fresh-keeping box, write the fresh-keeping box because I thought it was a refrigerator. As a result, I ate the bad food. Then I wanted the hotel to coordinate the rest. The food was temporarily stored in the refrigerator in the restaurant, and was rejected by the service staff at the front desk of the hotel repeatedly for various reasons instead of actively solving the problem. No other hotel in Sanya where I stayed has such a problem, and the food is only left for a few hours. In the end, I called the holiday hotel headquarters to solve it. During the call, I found out that the holiday hotel belongs to the InterContinental Hotels Group. I've been to InterContinental Hotels before, but I didn't expect this kind of facilities and services to be hotels owned by InterContinental. The hotels owned by InterContinental have always had a uniform standard of high-quality services. What a surprise! There are other facilities problems. For example, the floor of the washroom is very easy to slip, and the slippers prepared by the hotel are not spared. The swing lights by the swimming pool do not turn on at night. The staff turned off the ones that were originally bright. I don‚Äôt know if it is. Why, wait for such a situation. I have stayed at 7.8 star-rated hotels and homestays in Sanya this time, and I have never encountered a hotel like theirs. I swear I will never stay at all holiday hotel chains in the world again!

msg:Recommend to stay, especially young people. Sanya Bay has a wide view, and the sea view room is suitable for sea view. The hotel is quite new. The design of the room and swimming pool is beautiful, comfortable and a**ospheric, but the material quality of the room decoration is not enough. The whole design and facilities are still far from the Intercontinental of the Mid-Levels, but the price/performance ratio is still quite high. After all, the Intercontinental of the Mid-Levels The price is much more expensive than this. The service is also very good, because I did not sleep well, the hotel gave me a free upgrade to a quiet superior sea view room.
Did not eat breakfast. I see that your breakfast is indoors. I hope that breakfast can be eaten outdoors, which is safer. This is necessary in the case of an epidemic. Especially in winter, you can eat and enjoy the scenery while basking in the sun, relaxing and comfortable. The hotel I stayed in front was the Intercontinental Hotel in Mid-Levels. For breakfast, you can sit in the room or outdoors. We chose to sit outdoors.
The virus is a protracted battle, maybe ten, eight or 20 years. Let‚Äôs change the way the hotel eats.
The reason why I came to Sanya was because I was able to sit on an outside table for dinner, but found that some hotels and restaurants still eat in confined spaces. Some guests are willing to eat in an air-conditioned house, but there are still quite a few people like me who are afraid to eat in a confined space. Why can't they meet our requirements without having to pay much.
This is the third time I have come to Sanya this year. I dared not eat in the hotel the first two times. If the hotel can do better, I will spend more in the hotel.
I went to the gym. The doors and windows are closed and the air conditioner is turned on. It is not safe, but the air conditioner cannot be turned on in hot weather. There is no good way. But the design of your gym is not open even in winter.
I came to Sanya twice in winter. Many hotels have gyms with closed doors and windows and air-conditioning. In winter, the weather is neither cold nor hot. It is very comfortable to open doors and windows, and do not do anything that can be done. The concept of hotel epidemic prevention is not good.
For hotels, ventilation is the most important thing, far more than using disinfectant water to wipe furniture, elevators and other facilities. After all, this is a respiratory disease. I will tell you with the professional knowledge of a medical staff.
Activities that can be performed outdoors should not be done indoors. If you have to do it indoors, open windows and use electric fans.
