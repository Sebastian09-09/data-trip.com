The room charges won‚Äôt go against deposit, instead you have the pay and after you do the check out they will release the deposit back to you. For Chinese travelers this might seem odd.

msg:PRO:
- Strategic location, by the side of Xihu Lake and there were lots of restaurants and shopping mall behind it.

CONS:
Considering this is an International Hotel "Grand Hyatt"
- At first, they gave me a room that was not fully furnished (no bath tub and shower door), different than the pict that they advertised. I complained to the manager to give me another room. In the end she transfered me to the fully furnished one, but she seemed annoyed by my complain.
- Compared to other Hyatt rooms that I've stayed, this room was the smallest. 
- Limited selection of breakfast for a 5 stars International hotel. Not worth for the price they charged.

Noticed some hotel rules and measures were being applied differently to different guests, such as the ‚Äúno slippers in club room‚Äù rule? Not sure where the categorisation lies but even after pointing out the selective enforcement the staff remained indifferent. Overall attitude was quite snobby and unpleasant as well at least up on level 8.

They were able to accommodate my dietary needs as a vegetarian by removing the meat from some dishes. If you stay there over Christmas the Western restaurants must be booked in advance but we did manage to eat in the Chinese restaurant. The staff at the spa were very helpful and could explain the treatments and give recommendations. The front desk even allowed and helped me to look for a piece of jewellery that I'd left in the room,  despite already having checked out.

Although the area in front of the hotel gets very busy on the weekend the hotel is a peaceful haven. Great breakfast as well. Special thanks to James Li (Assistant Manager?). I booked a bouquet of flowers for the room for my partner; James called me personally on 2 occasions to arrange and check everything, and also arranged a complimentary room upgrade to a lake view room. James' efforts, personal service and upgrade were much appreciated, and made our Hangzhou visit even more special.

We got out after noticing there was a lot of green (possibly) algae floating around in the water. Breakfast choices were good.

It's a nice enough hotel but there could be more attention paid to overall cleanliness. It certainly wasn't up to other Hyatt hotels I have stayed at.

Before planning to travel to Hangzhou, I carefully selected hotels around West Lake on Ctrip.com. I personally feel that the most perfect hotel to enjoy the beautiful scenery of West Lake is this Grand Hyatt Hotel. It really did not disappoint us. Whether it is checking in or checking out, the staff are friendly and answer all questions. The procedures are clean and neat. Every staff here is polite, friendly, and responsible.
We chose to dine in the hotel's Chinese restaurant. The restaurant's foreman Susan Zhang is not only warm and thoughtful, but also proficient in professionalism and responsible. We chose to dine in the hotel's Chinese restaurant for lunch for several days. The dining environment is elegant and quiet, the dishes are exquisite and delicious, and the service is appropriate and comfortable. It's perfect!
The hotel concierge also specially sent us a birthday blessing cake. Susan Zhang in the restaurant carefully arranged the location for us and made warm decorations. This birthday was so warm!
The cleanliness of the swimming pool, the water temperature, and the seriousness and responsibility of the staff are also satisfactory.
In short, staying at Grand Hyatt Hangzhou for 3 nights and 4 days left us with a very perfect impression of our trip to Hangzhou, and we will choose to come back again.
Thank you very much to the hotel staff. Thanks to your hard work, we were able to have a perfect trip to Hangzhou! Thank you!

msg:I consulted Nicole at the switchboard in advance to see if I could upgrade to a lake view, but it seemed that the rooms were full that day and they were sold out even if I wanted to pay extra, so she asked me to make a note to see if it could be arranged. Since I checked in late at the hotel, all the rooms with the lake view I wanted were sold out. The check-in lady Edith said she had seen my note before and arranged a room that was a little far away but had some lake view, and asked me to see if it was okay. It didn't matter if I had to walk, as long as there was a lake view. I could also see Leifeng Pagoda from the window, and the night view of the pedestrian street was also beautiful, which was great!

There is Black Pearl and Lakeside 28 Restaurant on the first floor, which tastes very good.

I went out at Zhiweixuan next to the Grand Hyatt at 7 o'clock in the morning to buy pork buns, soy milk and glutinous Tiaotou cake. After taking it, I went to the West Lake and took a walk to have breakfast. There were already many people doing morning exercises beside the West Lake. After eating, I rode my bicycle to Sudi. Take a paddle boat ride. In the morning, we walked around the West Lake. Walk back to the hotel from Baidi. After checking out, we had lunch at Lakeside No. 28, drinking Mingqian Longjing and eating crab noodle dumplings. It was very comfortable. We ate until three o'clock and there was a discount for hotel guests, which was very goodüëç

msg:In 2005, it was Hyatt, and in 2018, it was upgraded to Grand Hyatt. The hotel was renovated, and the famous John Portman firm was invited to design the exterior, but in fact, the changes were not significant; the interior was designed by Thailand's P49 Design, which looks like a high-end business brand.
The location is the advantage of Grand Hyatt, with West Lake in front and Yintai behind, and both mountains, water and market. Therefore, it is especially suitable for business travelers, and it is great to take a walk while on a business trip. For those who like quietness, Lakeside Road is noisy and there are many large-scale customers, which may reduce the experience. Grand Hyatt has good service and well-trained reception staff. The details are also good, such as fragrance, tea fragrance in the lobby, and Zen fragrance in the guest rooms, all of which are comfortable and pleasant.
This time, I traveled alone to visit the south of the city. So I chose Grand Hyatt, and the Grand Club Lake View Room had a window of lake and mountains, which was safe, service, and cost-effective.

It was very convenient as it was close to the HSR Hangzhou East Station via Line 1 and close to the station. The hotel is in a great location with Lake Saiko right in front of it.
I made a reservation without specifying a view so that I could enjoy the view from the club lounge, but I was lucky to be able to see the lake towards the end of the room despite it being semi-circular and with a city view. We arrived at the hotel before 12:00, but it was not the busy season, so it was nice that we were able to get to our room right away.
The club lounge on the 8th floor is spacious and has a terrace, with a panoramic view of West Lake, so it was worth booking a club room. The night view of the lake was also very beautiful.
We ate Hangzhou cuisine outside and took a walk around the West Lake ‚Üí had afternoon tea at the club lounge ‚Üí took a walk around the West Lake ‚Üí had cocktail time at the club lounge, and the next day after breakfast, we took a boat ride on the West Lake and enjoyed ourselves leisurely until checkout.

1. The guest room has an unbeatable view of the West Lake. I thought the hotel was too old but the room was very compact. There was a big sofa next to the bed. After the renovation, the details were very good. There were many power sockets. The bed and quilt were very comfortable. The air conditioner made no sound at all. The shower room has a large amount of water and is very comfortable, and the selection of toiletries is also very good. It was really surprising that our family of three had three sets of toothbrushes, slippers and towels prepared in advance for us when we checked in.
2. Both the service and the dishes in the Chinese restaurant are top-notch in taste and service. Gold Medal Braised Pork, Hangzhou Pepper M9 Wagyu Beef, Song Sao Fish Soup, and Beancurd Fish are great. I heard that Gold Medal Braised Pork is the first original creation of the hotel chef. The tofu is made by the hotel itself every day. I think it beats those Internet celebrity restaurants. It turns out that it is now a Michelin Chinese restaurant and it really deserves it. The service is impeccable, every detail is taken care of.
3. The quality of the breakfast room is excellent. The seasonal bamboo shoot buns, Pian'erchuan, black truffle scrambled eggs, soup noodles, fresh fruit juices, waffles, etc. taste great.
4. The executive lounge has an unrivaled view of the lake. The simple meals during happy hour are particularly exquisite and the service is very good. As long as the guests are at the tea table, there will be waiters to help pour tea and add water, which is very considerate.
5. The set menu at the steakhouse is great. The food tastes great, and the service is even better. The various dipping sauces for the steak, the various knives used to cut the steak, and the sauces and flavors in the appetizer bread are all unique and delicious. The plates are heated to high temperatures, which is really thoughtful.
6. The afternoon tea set was really unexpected, especially the salty salmon coupons and Wellington-style steak buns which really surprised my whole family.
Thank you Grand Hyatt Hotel for bringing my whole family a happy New Year holiday.

I switched from the Liangzhu Intercontinental the day before. In terms of hardware, the Grand Hyatt is certainly not as good as the InterContinental, but I really lived in a comfortable room. The room is not big and not very smart, but the old French decoration style is very nice and makes me feel safe. .
I didn't experience the breakfast, but I did have the buffet dinner. Except for the desserts, everything else was not good enough. It was four to five hundred people per person and it didn't have a lake view. It was not worth it.

msg:Good location, good service and good hygiene.
A certain deposit will be charged when checking into the hotel. The deposit will be returned quickly after check-out. The deposit will arrive in your account in about two hours.
This time I stayed in room 614. You should be able to see the musical fountain at night. In77 is a five-minute walk away from the hotel.
The hotel's room service is also responsive. The bathroom is separated from wet and dry areas, and the internet connection is also good. Except for the possibility of a little noise from tourists passing by in the corridor, the sound insulation effect of the room is also OK.
Breakfast is on the first floor, and there will be staff to guide you in. However, the variety of breakfast is a bit limited, so it is best to eat it earlier, as there may be more people there later.

Because business is good and we also receive tour groups, breakfast is sometimes overcrowded and noisy. Leisure guests cannot have a meal, so they have to stay in executive rooms.

There was a bad smell in the sewer in the bathroom. After the reaction, we dealt with it promptly and followed up to inquire about the situation. It was very heart-warming.
The hotel's breakfast is very good. Not only is the food rich in variety and delicious, but the excellent service must also be praised. Two points are great: basically no one bothers you to collect the dishes during the meal~Have you ever encountered a situation where certain food is not replenished in time~~You can see that the foreman has been patrolling~~Like it here ! Another little suggestion is that the amount of small wontons can be smaller. If you finish it, you will be too full. If you don‚Äôt finish it, it will be a waste~ü§£
A very pleasant stay! grateful!

msg:The location is first-class. Remember to choose the executive lake view when booking. The price difference is not big. However, the Ctrip order was not shown and the room I got was a bit biased. There is no way to adjust the price temporarily. The room hygiene is basically satisfactory. The service in the executive restaurant is very good. The breakfast is a bit monotonous, but it is basically sufficient. The top floor balcony has been remodeled. The complimentary dinner and afternoon tea are of good quality.
Note: The road in and out of the hotel is a bit congested during peak hours. There is a musical fountain by the lake at night and there are a lot of people. The hotel should know more about the restrictions on cars with foreign license plates so that guests can consult.

After using it, everyone in the house will go to the sauna. The toilet paper that I can‚Äôt stand is also wet, and the toilet paper will stick to the buttocks. Elderly people with rheumatoid arthritis should not stay here.

The soundproofing of the room is very poor. What is it like to listen to the next door watching TV dramas until the early hours of the morning?

The hotel has bad feng shui and strong yin energy. This hotel is located in the southeast of West Lake. The main entrance faces the West Lake, and the turbid air pours directly into the hotel. Those who take promotion exams should not stay here.

Grand Hyatt has always had a habit of undercutting guests. It is recommended to check the price on the day of check-in to avoid lowering the price before check-in and making a big mistake.

The elderly and children can take boats and other things when they go out. This is also because there were so many people in the first two days that it was difficult to queue. We had breakfast on the eighth floor in the morning. It rained a little by the West Lake and there were fewer people. We had a clear view upstairs. We took the opportunity to go downstairs and got on the boat smoothly soon. Before leaving, the lobby manager Wu Yanpei thoughtfully gave the children a bear toy. Thank you for your warm hospitality.

As soon as I entered the lobby, I was attracted by the grand hyatt's usual grand and luxurious design. I was a little worried before that the hotel in 2005 would be a bit old? When you enter the room, you can hardly find anything wrong with the size, decoration, facilities and details. The light-colored marble in the porch and bathroom is bright and clean, the dark wooden floor in the bedroom is low-luxury and clean, and there is no doubt about the hyatt quality of the mattress. There are a lot of mirrors that make the ladies' door always pleasant but not feng shui-compliant. The movable partition between the bathtub and the bedroom is both private and open. All the details are in place. The No.1 ranking is really well-deserved. Well, the food is also very good

The young lady at the front desk is gentle and enthusiastic. The staff who greet you at the door will take the initiative to help you open the door and move your luggage. It's so nice! Thank you to all the staff at Nine Points for a great stay. Looking forward to seeing you next time!

msg:Bad reviews: 1. Poor service; 2. Poor hygiene; 3. Differential trea**ent; 4. Unable to solve the problem in time; First of all, the front desk was impatient when consulting, there was no smiling face, the hygiene in the room was very poor, the phone was not working, the lights on the roof kept flashing, and the floor was on the floor. Creaking sound. You can ignore all of this. When I was getting ready to go to bed at night, I heard water dripping from the bathroom pipe and I couldn't sleep. It was after 11 o'clock at night and I couldn't do it anymore, so I called the front desk. I couldn't find the service desk number, so I had to call the hotel switchboard. The switchboard lady said I was asked to wait for half an hour to call the workers to repair it. I was speechless. I said it was already night and asked me to call the front desk. The switchboard lady made me speechless again and actually asked me to report my ID number before I could be transferred to the front desk. This is unheard of! I couldn't help but get angry, so I waited for a long time for a reply saying that the front desk was busy serving customers and had no time to answer my call! After traveling all over the country for so many years, let alone a five-star hotel, does a hotel respond to guests like this? Don‚Äôt we count as hotel guests? Finally, the front desk asked us to change rooms and came up with a new room card. They watched us in pajamas carrying large and small bags to change rooms, and left without saying anything! I thought this might be the corporate culture of Grand Hyatt, but the next day at breakfast I saw that the waiters were very patient with foreign guests and greeted them with smiles. Well, as an ordinary Chinese guest, I can just not go to your hotel in the future! ! ! At six o'clock in the evening, a man claiming to be the hotel manager called to inquire about the situation. He said that he had never made time for what happened the night before. Well, what else could he say. . . It‚Äôs really not something that can be expressed with just one word! ! ! Oh, and one more thing, I didn‚Äôt know that when the mineral water in this hotel is boiled, a layer of alkali will float away! ! ! I ask all my friends not to go to the Grand Hyatt Hotel in the future! ! ! ! ! ! !

Several young waiters are indifferent and lively, especially in the buffet restaurant. Special praise is given to a fat waitress in the Lakeside restaurant. She has always been...

I spent 3500 just for the lake view room, but the first picture was the Ctrip picture, and the second picture was the picture of the room I checked in. I called the front desk to explain the situation. The front desk said lightly that the Ctrip picture was for reference only and was not real. I was convinced, so why did I spend more money. I strongly requested to change the room. The front desk said that someone would lead us there in 20 minutes, but we couldn't wait. I made many calls and they only said please wait, no apology or time, and the room was not changed until 6 o'clock. Third, the room I booked had two 198 first-floor breakfasts, which was more expensive than the one without breakfast. As a result, the front desk told me that my room could only be eaten on the 8th floor. The next day, I thought it was wrong and confirmed with Ctrip and found that I was cheated. Because I booked two rooms, my son went to the first floor for breakfast, and my husband went down to see him and sat on the side and was directly driven away? ! ! ! Fourth, the room was not clean. I had a rash all over my body after sleeping all night, which was relieved after taking a shower the next day. Fifth, the service staff act like they own the hotel, so arrogant. Two rooms cost 3500+2400, and I'm just here to suffer.

msg:1. Advantages: The hotel faces the West Lake and is backed by Yintai. Transportation and dining are very convenient.
2. Although the hotel faces the music fountain, it does not provide viewing advantages. I asked the front desk if I could go to the garden on the eighth floor to watch. The front desk responded by calling the switchboard to inquire. I asked the waiter at the door of the restaurant if I could go to the eighth floor. The waiter told me that I need to buy a ticket to enter. The ticket price is more than 200...the service is not professional enough. Personally, I feel that since there is a venue available, it is definitely a major selling point. After all, the experience of squeezing to the lake to watch is extremely poor, with huge crowds of people and bugs flying everywhere.
3. The entrance of the hotel is extremely unfriendly. I wonder if it is because it faces the West Lake and it is inconvenient to enter and exit.
4. The sanitation of the guest room is poor. There are residual hairs in the bathroom basin and bathtub, and the toilet smell is serious.
5. We waited until 3:30 in the lobby and still didn‚Äôt get a room. Although we upgraded to a side lake view room, we were arranged at the end of the corridor. Dragging suitcases and children, you don‚Äôt want to go out anymore. Experience Feeling bad. Never take the room at the end of the corridor!

I chose a lake view room, you can see a good view, the hotel has free parking, there are charging piles, the swimming pool is not big, and it is not a standard pool, it is mainly for children to play, but it is also 1.5 meters deep. The location of the hotel is excellent. As soon as you leave the door, there is a queue for the West Lake sightseeing bus, which is very convenient. The night view of the West Lake on the 8th floor is very beautiful at night, and there are many choices of movies on the hotel TV at night. The breakfast is quite satisfactory.

Disadvantages: There is a lot of dust on the table and beside the bed in the room, it is not cleaned very well, the carpet looks a bit dirty, the facilities are a bit old, the sound insulation effect is not very good, and I was woken up several times at night. Also, when I arrived at the hotel, I had to wait for two hours to get a room. The answer was that the rooms were full during the summer vacation, which was a bad experience.

The design of the shower switch in the bathroom is also very user-friendly. It is not under the faucet, but on the edge of the bathroom entrance, so that it is easy to turn on the switch without entering, and people will not be showered. Finally, I would like to praise the service again. We checked in at 3 o'clock. When we arrived, the room was not available. The front desk actively helped us find two rooms that were close and could be checked in the fastest, and then gave us apology fruit. However, as a five-star hotel, there is no welcome fruit after check-in, which is a bit lacking, and needs to be improved

Thanks to Jessica for helping me upgrade to the lake view room on the sixth floor in advance, which instantly improved the hotel by two levels. Just outside the hotel is the West Lake Music Fountain, with Yintai on the left and the cruise ship pier on the right. It can be said that eating, drinking and having fun are seamlessly connected.

Service: The hotel reception at the door can open the door after parking, carry luggage, and be warm and decent.

Environment: It meets the standards of a five-star hotel. The sound insulation of the room is very good. Although it is the peak season of summer vacation, it is difficult to hear the noise of children.

If we want to raise some shortcomings, we still need to pay attention to some small details. For example, we can help customers arrange the scattered cosmetics after daily use, arrange and paste clothes a little bit, etc. The service is more reflected in the details.
Overall, a great stay experience.

msg:The only advantage of this hotel is that the location is very close to the West Lake, which is convenient for visiting the West Lake. But other aspects are really not flattering.
Let me complain first, the hygiene of the room. It may be that the hotel has been around for a long time, and it is generally old. There are yellow things on the floor of the bathroom and shower room. I don't know if it is scale or something, but it looks disgusting anyway. Another thing that is more unacceptable is the flush toilet, which always smells of urine inexplicably.
The most irritating thing is that just after entering the room, there was an extra rag on the sink. At first glance, I thought it was the underwear left by the previous guest (it was later confirmed that it was the rag left by the auntie). For a hotel of this level, I did not expect the room service to be so casual.
Let‚Äôs talk about the hotel‚Äôs breakfast again. Except for the good environment of the restaurant, there are few types of breakfast and the taste is average. There is basically nothing to eat for breakfast at 198/person. To be honest, it is really not as good as some chain hotels.
Of course, objectively speaking, the service staff of the hotel are generally good, especially the uncle who deposits luggage at the front desk, who is enthusiastic and proactive, and gave a map of the West Lake very thoughtfully. It's the only place where I feel like I'm staying in a 5 star hotel. I also want to explain that after the rag incident, a female leader came first and asked about the situation, explaining that the auntie left it after cleaning. I asked why the rag was left behind and whether the cleaning was done. She told me something worried, and asked the auntie to clean it up again, and then left. Because I came back late after playing the West Lake that day, I only stayed for one night anyway, just think about it. Later, the room manager on duty also came to understand the situation in time, and gave fruit and small gifts to apologize.
To sum up, this hotel is not cost-effective. Although I only booked the cheapest room, it cost more than 2,200 a night. I feel that apart from the excellent location, other aspects are really not as good as some four-star or even three-star hotels.

A small suggestion, the breakfast variety is not rich enough. I ate four or five fried spring rolls for breakfast, and took two moreüç©üç©. I looked around and couldn't find anything I wanted to eat.

When I opened the window at 6:30 the next morning, the view I saw was a big tree (as shown in the picture below). I was completely dumbfounded. I have never encountered a hotel that can deceive guests like this. I contacted the staff and they changed my room very quickly. But I got up early at 6:30 because I planned to go for a morning jog by the West Lake instead of packing up my suitcases and changing rooms! Very disappointed, what is commercial fraud, I hope the hotel can reflect deeply, release reservation information realistically, and cherish the reputation of Grand Hyatt.

When I arrived at the gate of the hotel, I carried a heavy suitcase. The doorman saw that I didn‚Äôt respond, like a stone statue. I walked into the hotel and immediately went to the front desk. I saw the black suit in the lobby reaching out to help me. I took three or four steps to get to the front desk without any need. It was just a pretense. When I got to the front desk, I said there was no room and I had to wait for more than an hour. The room was cleaned every afternoon. I usually didn‚Äôt go back at noon in the morning and needed to rest. It was a mess, and within two minutes of laying down, the housekeeper knocked on the door, and then there was no one to lead me to a seat for self-study, and I sat down, and no one asked me what to drink. A few people in black suits got together and chatted, as if they had nothing to do. The service does not match the five-star at all, it is a very average hotel

There was no queue for check-in and check-out during the peak period of the Dragon Boat Festival. If there was a need, it was quickly delivered to the guest room. The location is very invincible, just beside the West Lake. The shortcomings are two points: First, the facilities are a bit old, but they are well maintained, and the roof of the guest rooms is too low. Second, it is very unfriendly to takeaways! The takeaway place has to walk 30 meters out of the hotel and then down a very dangerous slope. The slope is very uneven and slippery when it rains. My wife slipped and slipped twice a trip down. It is very difficult to wear high heels! May I ask if the hotel arranges such a place and the guests break it, are you not responsible? Can you have some foresight.

The area is about the same size as the Shangri-La in the city (not too big), and the service is pretty good. During the stay coincides with the birthday, also sent a small cake! Will consider staying next time. What I need to complain about is the hotel buffet dinner and the Horizon Club semi-buffet breakfast. Maybe I had too much expectations. The theme of the day was crayfish. I took the first plate and then I didn‚Äôt take it again. It's also soft, the food is not too much, and the quality is not good, just so-so. The semi-buffet breakfast in the Horizon Club is simply terrible (I would rather not eat it). No one will guide you to the seat except for the registered room number. The semi-buffet I have eaten in the hotel where I stayed is in addition to the basic food. There should be an a la carte menu. I searched for a place in a daze, and went to get the food in a daze. What's worse, the Chinese-style results included fried eggs, noodles, and small wontons, and the rest were bread and the like. Oh, and a plate of cauliflower, man, this is your semi-buffet breakfast, I'd rather be in bed, to be honest. Let‚Äôs just talk about this. There are so many hotels of the same kind in Hangzhou, which are regarded as better hotels. Your breakfast is really not as good as a three-star hotel. In this regard, your elder brother Bai Yue does not know how much he has strengthened you. If it wasn't for the good location, I would definitely not consider staying again.

There are also disadvantages, that is, the sewer smell in the bathroom is still relatively strong, which probably has something to do with the old house!

I booked a double standard room in the so-called 5-diamond high-end hotel by the West Lake. There is no view to see. The common room is below the 5th floor, and the lake view room is 6-8 floors. I can‚Äôt see anything when I go to the 6th floor. The room is small, the bed is only 1.1 meters wide, the air conditioner is out of order, you wake up in the cold at night, the interior supplies are simple, there is no smart toilet, no fruit plate, no welcome, only a blond Russian is hired to decorate the facade. It is easy not to let you check out halfway, and you will be stuck to the end. The food is ok, but super expensive.

I sincerely hope that other travelers will not fall into the pit again.

It is very convenient for shopping, dining, transportation and shopping by the lakeside. The hotel service is very good. I checked in at 11 o'clock on Friday, and gave the front row room a very nice location. Although I didn't live in the Regency Club, I wanted to go to the terrace to take some photos, and the front desk was very enthusiastic to help me get on the elevator with my card. The breakfast variety is also quite rich, and the overall check-in experience is very good.

msg:During this trip to Hangzhou, Park Hyatt, Grand Hyatt, and InterContinental are all staying. The most disappointing thing for me is Grand Hyatt.
1. First of all, the Junyue room is the smallest among the three. The corridors are also narrow and the windows are small, not floor-to-ceiling windows. The overall feeling is very crowded. The bathroom is so small and you have to put a small bathtub in it. It‚Äôs better not to have a bathtub. The shower area in Park Hyatt is better than that Your whole bathroom is fine.
2. The room and the corridor are full of smoke smell. It is obviously a non-smoking room, but there are obviously people smoking in the room, and we even saw someone smoking with the door open (because the windows of the room cannot be opened! They themselves feel bored) , Although there are a lot of air purifiers in the corridor, they don't work at all, the air conditioner doesn't produce much wind, and the windows can't be opened. It's like a windowless room in an express hotel. The room is so stuffy!
3. It can be said that there is no service in the whole process of check-in. No one takes the luggage when entering the door. When checking in at the front desk, there are only two people in total, and they have to answer the phone part-time. At that time, the front desk went to take a seat, and no one picked it up, so I had to wait until she came back to be seated. Is there no one in your hotel?
4. Room facilities, please look at the picture yourself, in a hotel at 1800 a night, the curtains are manual and the windows cannot be opened. The funniest thing is that the big bed is actually two single beds! Sleeping at night with obvious seams in the middle, something like this in a hotel of this price, I don't understand.
5. It doesn‚Äôt matter if the takeaway can‚Äôt be delivered upstairs. Your takeaway cabinet is still on the ba*****t floor of another building. You have to walk outside and go down a slope to the ba*****t to get it. On rainy days, we both wore slippers to get takeaway and came back. The slippers are soaked through!
In general, if I want to book this hotel because it is close to the West Lake, I don't think there is any need to be wronged. I can choose the Intercontinental at a lower price. No matter the room or the lobby, it is not as spacious and grand as yours Are there many? Isn‚Äôt the high-rise river view more fragrant than your lake view? People‚Äôs hotels in 2010 have electric curtains, but the one you built in 2018 still uses manual curtains. Why?

The room was spacious, comfortable, very clean and tidy, with nice furniture and decor. I especially like the bedding and bathroom linens provided by the hotel, which are very soft and comfortable, adding a lot of comfort to the whole stay experience.

The food provided by the hotel's restaurant is very delicious, with a variety of meals, suitable for guests of all tastes. I especially recommend the buffet breakfast in the restaurant, very rich and delicious.

In addition, the hotel facilities are also very complete, there is a nice swimming pool and a gym, I had a very good time there.

The hotel also has a terrace where you can enjoy the beauty of the West Lake without having to share with other passing passengers. From the terrace of the hotel, you can directly overlook the beauty of the West Lake. It is quite beautiful to look at the Bai Causeway and Su Causeway in the setting sun.

All in all, I am very satisfied with the accommodation experience in this five-star hotel, I feel very warm and comfortable. I highly recommend this hotel, if you are looking for a luxurious and enjoyable stay, this is an excellent choice.

Although it is understandable during busy hours, the stool, faucet, and bathtub are all dusty, the mirror has fingerprints, and the washbasin is stained with paper towels and water droplets. This is the first time I have encountered a hotel where a slacker like me can spend 20 minutes on cleaning.

Facilities: When I slept at night, I found that the air conditioner was really smelly, with a strong musty smell. I chose to be stuffy and turned off the air conditioner. It is said that the faucet in your bathroom is also installed upside down, and the bedside spotlight is also upside down (the left control panel controls the right light). It can be said that there is no exhaust in the bathroom at all, and it is full of mist after taking a shower.

Service: The attitude from the front desk to the aunt is unfriendly. I claim to be very polite and polite, but the people I meet are not friendly. The cleaners on the floor push the linen trolley and don't push it aside at all when they see the guests. They need the guests to stand at the door of the room and let him pass in the middle. So why didn't I even complain and do my own hygiene. I don't want to interact with the staff at all.

Environment: The location is very convenient, the pedestrian street and the West Lake are just downstairs, and the convenience store is a few minutes away.
In summary, your store will never again.

msg:When I booked the hotel, I found that there were many problems mentioned in the comments. Now I will talk about my feelings. Generally speaking, the experience is good, the location of the hotel is good, and the quality of the staff is high. First of all, let me talk about what can be improved: 1. The bath water is really not hot like the legend. As a five-star group hotel in a place like Hangzhou without a special environment, I really don't understand why. 2. Can‚Äôt the minibar in the executive room be changed to free? Do you have to go to the executive lounge to enjoy it... 3. The coffee at the restaurant on the first floor was cold for two consecutive days. I was received by the same employee for two days. I said your coffee was cold, and the employee was dissatisfied Ask me instead: Do you want something extra hot? I said that I need normal hot coffee, and then she took it away very unhappy. After a while, I changed a cup and left without saying anything... The work is not easy, so I don‚Äôt say anything, I hope I can treat the guests with a normal attitude just fine.
Talk about a good place. 1. The quality of the staff is high. There are no arrogant people in the legend. From the first day of arrival to the last departure of the hotel, except for the female employee in the restaurant on the first floor, all employees in all depar**ents and depar**ents are very kind and dedicated. Although there are sometimes a little problem, I can feel that everything is perfect. I am actively thinking of ways for the guests and trying to do better. All the staff in the executive lounge, thank you for helping to change rooms, making hot coffee without asking if I need extra hot:) Replenishing various meals in time and reminding me of various precautions, thank you! 2. The location of the hotel is very convenient. Although the room is really not big, I don't know how big the guests who commented that the room is too small want it to be big. Anyway, it is more than enough for two people. It is convenient to eat, shop and go to various scenic spots. The platform outside the executive lounge has a great view, and it is very comfortable to sit and have a drink when you are not going out. 3. The hotel buffet is very good, there is nothing wrong with it except expensive :)

The West Lake Pedestrian Street is just outside the door, and Yintai Plaza is next to it. It is really too lively. The hotel room is very clean, and it happens to be able to see the West Lake. This is the hotel with the cleanest exterior glass among the hotels I have stayed in so far. The front desk at the check-in was very warm and thoughtful. Because the business was too good and there was no room, I suggested that we go to have lunch first. As soon as the room was available, he called us immediately. He apologized and said that the room was a bit long in the inner corridor. I don't mind, but I didn't expect the corridor to be really long... The bath water is very big and very hot. Except that the bed is a bit small, I am satisfied with everything else.

After a day of shopping around the West Lake, I was so tired that I didn‚Äôt even want to go back to the room to rest. It‚Äôs the beginning of March. The weather is actually not hot at all, but I was sweating in shorts in the room. Although the hotel brought me a fan, it still couldn‚Äôt solve the extremely stuffy environment in the room. The executive restaurant on the 8th floor of the hotel has a nice view.

It looks like our hotel is very busy and there are many receptions! It's not your shop that's busy! I have to look at your face for more than 7,000 a night, so I will change to another house decisively! But other than this guy with glasses, everything else is fine. But this one is really underwhelming. Later, I also deliberately observed his attitude towards others! it's the same!

I haven't been out for three years due to the epidemic, and this time I chose Hangzhou, which I visited seven years ago. The West Lake is right outside the hotel. Although it is not a place where scenic spots are concentrated, it is good to walk around the West Lake when the weather is good. Lakeside Intime is right next to it, as well as luxury stores. This time I chose 1688 for one night, with breakfast and dinner buffets. Great value for money, good buffet quality. Although the hotel hardware is not the latest, it is very quiet to sleep at night. It's a pity that it has been raining in Hangzhou at the time we chose. Even so, there are still bustling tourists everywhere, which shows the charm of West Lake. The Black Pearl One Diamond Lakeside 28 in the hotel looks very elegant, because the hotel is too full to have a chance to taste it.

msg:From arriving at the hotel, the welcome staff at the door are only responsible for driving the door and not taking luggage. If you have a lot of luggage, you have to go in and find the luggage-carrying person in the concierge. We checked in at 00:00 and arrived at the hotel at about 15:50. We kept saying that there was no clean room, so we could choose to wait in the lobby to get a few drink coupons, or we could go shopping by the West Lake and wait. Because there are old people and children who are already very tired, we chose to wait in the lobby , There was no communication in the whole process, until the last part, we squatted on the ground and talked with us. I have never encountered this kind of 3-star hotel in third- and fourth-tier cities, so it was a bit embarrassing. In the end, I repeatedly confirmed with us whether to drink coupons. , made us very embarrassed, isn't it the choice you asked us to make? After the end, we went to the bathroom on the first floor. There were 2 long queues in the 4 rooms. Then at 16:30, no one informed us to check in and we were still waiting. Finally, I went to the front desk to inquire and met a very nice sister! Got us a room! This sister praises it! After entering the room, the facilities and sanitation are good! It is very inconvenient to step on the trash can in the bathroom. You can consider replacing it and it will be full in a short while! The toiletries were used up and it was not timely to add them. Fortunately, I brought them myself and it was enough! When the breakfast restaurant is crowded, you need to queue up! I agree because it will be better to control the dining environment inside if the outside is controlled! There is also the dessert area that I have to say is the most satisfying! Quite satisfied! 100 points! Generally speaking, it is a relatively high-end hotel by the West Lake. It is good to take care of the emotions of the employees and not hold complaints at work! The younger brother at the door when I left the store was very active and took the initiative to help with the box. Thank you very much üôè

Although the hotel was renovated in 18 years. But the hardware is holding up pretty well. Room attendants are very nice.
Went early on the day of check-in. Checked in first. But no room yet. Vera at the front desk helped me reserve a room with a relatively good location. This view is really invincible. I sat by the window and basked in the sun all afternoon. Drink afternoon tea. Staring at the scenery in a daze.

Although only for one night. But the impression is particularly good. Every hotel staff member I met was very nice. Warm and friendly. Next time I come to Hangzhou, I will continue to choose Grand Hyatt.

After searching for a long time, I thought they were free. I have stayed in many five-star hotels before, and drinks and snacks are free. In the end, I found out that I was charged more than 1,500 yuan, and a small bag of potato chips cost more than 20 yuan? Couldn't complain because I had left the hotel. I was later told that the price tag was placed in the drawer next to it, lying flat and pressed under the coffee capsule. If you don't drink coffee, you can't see it at all. Is this the way to promote consumption now? Deliberately misleading consumers and committing fraud, is this the practice of five-star hotels? ? Such a low-level, really weird! It's like eating flies, it's really disgusting...I will complain to 12315 to the end

There was no toiletry bag when I checked in. I called the front desk around 1:40 and delivered it to the room at 3 o'clock. I wash my hair and take a shower, that's fine. The door seal of the bathroom was pried open, and the switch was inconvenient. All trash cans do not have trash bags, and the foot trash cans in the bathroom cannot be opened. Afternoon tea, 2:00 to 4:00. I went at 3:30, there were no snacks and fruits, and I didn't know what else, because I didn't see it. There were about five or six guests who went at the same time as me, and none of them ate. There are only two or three kinds of fruit juices, so everyone will have some drinks. A bad experience.

This time, I returned from Hengdian for one night and flew back to Guangzhou in the morning. We booked the Regency Club Lake View King Bed Room. Since we arrived early (about 10:50), we said that the room had not been checked out, so we went out to play and have lunch. Return to the hotel at approximately 1:50 pm. Went to the front desk and said the room hadn't been cleaned. Shouldn't you be ready for the guests who arrive early? Speechless. The front desk asked us to rest in the rest room on the first floor and wait for 14:30. There must be a room for me. We booked a Regency Club room and we were not asked to rest and wait at the Regency Club on the 8th floor. Later, I proposed to take us up to the 8th floor. When I checked in on the 8th floor at 14:30, I was told that the room had not been cleaned, and there was no other room to replace, and I would have to wait another 20 minutes. There is nothing left to say. Just wait. After 20 minutes, the waiter delivered the room card (it was the waiter on the 8th floor) and finally checked in. Since we have children with us and we will fly in the morning tomorrow, we didn't leave the hotel. Dinner is also a buffet eaten on the 1st floor. At 7:20 the next morning, I wanted to have breakfast on the 8th floor. The room card cannot be swiped up to the 8th floor (we lived in room 718), so we went to the 1st floor for breakfast. Check out after breakfast. Ask the front desk why my room card cannot go to the 8th floor. After checking for a while at the front desk, they only said that they might have given me the wrong room card. Really speechless. There will be no next time.

The Regency Club is on the 7th-8th floor, where you can enjoy afternoon tea and happy time. The service is excellent, quietly without disturbing the guests, I like the exclusive mask very much. The electric curtains are good, and the breakfast is also rich.

I read the price on Dianping, 438 yuan per person, and the available date on the review is from December 31st with no exceptions. As a result, Xing hurried to confirm, saying that 528 people, only emphasizing that 12/31 is a special day, so The price does not count in the review? ? ? Is it unreasonable to refuse to use the package price on the review? ? ? Think about it later, because we came out to play happily, so we didn't plan to compete with them, but when we went to make a reservation, we were directly told that it was 600+ people? ? ? The stock has not risen so much in a day? ? ? Later, the waiter explained that 600+ has any special dishes, although in the end I don't know where the specials are. At the end of the checkout, it said that we bought one and got one free because we are hotel guests? ? ? ? So the front is playing with our emotions and creating a little ups and downs? ? ? absolutely
Let‚Äôs talk about the room card. The door didn‚Äôt open just after finishing the application. We asked the room attendant upstairs to reset it at the front desk. In addition, we stayed for two nights, but when we went to swipe the room card the next day, we swiped it twice again. Can't open? ? ? ? Didn't we pay enough for the room? ? ?
In addition to the good location, the lake view room looks like the roof of a swimming pool, which is bigger than the lake view of the West Lake. Finally, the service is really bad! ! !

msg:Every time I come to Hangzhou, I live in Grand Hyatt, but this time I have to give a bad review. The experience is very bad.
1. First of all, there was a machine outside the room that was arranged for the first time that was making noise all the time. After waiting for an hour to change rooms, the so-called non-smoking room had obvious smoke smell, so I had to change rooms again, which wasted more than an hour.
2. When Ctrip placed the order, I purchased 2 breakfasts per room, but the hotel has two breakfast places, which were not stated on the order, and the staff at the wrong restaurant did not remind me.
3. I booked a room card for two nights in advance but couldn‚Äôt get in the next day, and had to go downstairs and queue up to renew the card. There is a queue in the lobby all day long, and it takes half an hour to check in two rooms, which is really a bad experience.
4. Booked another room with clogged shower drain
The service attitude of the staff is good, but the management of the entire hotel is chaotic, which leads to a mismatch of the experience with such a high price.

Yuki We received professional fake smiles and nonsense throughout the whole process. We couldn‚Äôt understand customers‚Äô appeals and didn‚Äôt help customers solve problems. Quality, although the problem was solved by his superior in the end, he was very disappointed with the service of such an international brand chain. He claimed to be a director, and he didn't know what the standards of the director were. The service and dishes of the 28 restaurant at the other end of the hotel lobby are completely online, and there is a big difference. Later, I heard that another director in charge is in charge. Sure enough, it will be different, and the team they lead must also be hugely different!

Afterwards, the room attendant brought me a cake in the room, it was delicious! üò≠When I was dining in the restaurant at night, I also gave me a cake, and the staff I met all sent me birthday wishes...Because of the hard work of the hotel staff, I had a very happy birthday! If there is a chance in the future, I would like to come and live again!
Ctrip's package this time is very affordable, including two breakfasts and two nights, the hotel buffet has a lot of dishes, and the desserts are very delicious!
The traffic around the hotel is also very convenient, next to the shopping mall, life is very convenient! And it's really close to the West Lake! If you just come here for tourism, it is also very good!

So I went shopping for about two hours. I came back to the front desk and asked about the second room. The front desk called the housekeeping depar**ent to ask if the second room was available. In front of me, there was an argument between the two parties. After a long time of tossing, they gave me another room.
As an old five-star hotel, the service is really not flattering. I just checked in and there were no slippers in the room. I called and asked for two pairs. At the beginning, no one answered the phone, but I finally got through. They didn't send it until I checked out the next day; I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because of the lack of ventilation, but there‚Äôs always an uncomfortable smell; the toilet seat in the room is broken; after checking out, the luggage was loaded into the car, and the security guard asked me to park the car to the side, which is convenient for other commercial vehicles with small luggage My brother also complained to me and asked me why I parked on the side. It was inconvenient for him to carry the luggage, and the luggage was piled up randomly, which caused the rear door of the car to not close. The rest of the experience really smashed the hotel signboard!

As soon as you go out of the hotel, it is on the edge of the West Lake, and there is a stop for a car around the lake. It is also very convenient to go out for a walk or drink tea nearby; go forward It is the Intime Depar**ent Store, which is very convenient.

The service attitude at the front desk of the hotel is very good. The epidemic prevention code in Hangzhou is very complicated. The hotel will remind you to remember to check every day. There is a nucleic acid test point at the entrance of the hotel. This time I stayed in a lake view room. I spent most of the day looking at the West Lake from the room, which was very comfortable.


The steakhouse and Chinese restaurant in the hotel are more recommended. I have both checked them out twice. Overall, it is a relatively satisfactory stay experience.

msg:The location of the hotel is very good. The West Lake is just outside the door. Although the hotel has a certain period of time, it is very well maintained and has great character, just like a gentleman. This time I upgraded the lake view room, and the whole window can see the lake view. The scenery is really amazing. The hotel I booked this time includes breakfast + afternoon tea + dinner. The hotel's meals are very good, even if it is a simple meal, the taste is very good. The buffet dinner is very rich and delicious. I will come again next time

Opposite the hotel is the West Lake, just a few steps in front of the entrance is the West Lake Loop Tour bus; next to the shopping paradise Lakeside Intime, food and shopping are very complete; the Wulin Night Market, which is a must-check in Hangzhou, is also about a 10-minute walk, 1.2KM. The Chinese restaurant of the hotel is also a black pearl restaurant. I ate two meals in a row, the taste is good, and the service attitude is also very good. This time, I chose a house with a small yard, and there is a sweet-scented osmanthus tree. As soon as I walk out of the yard, the yard is full of fragrance. The attitude of the hotel staff is also very good. Next time I come to Hangzhou, the first choice is still Grand Hyatt.

At around 19 o‚Äôclock on the night of the 17th, one of us had a yellow code. At that time, we were very nervous, which meant that we couldn‚Äôt stay in the hotel and were caught on the street. He first comforted us, told us not to be nervous, he would help us appeal, and the appeal was successful, we successfully moved in, I was very impressed with this boy! Warm and responsible! I dined in a Chinese restaurant that night. This dish is top-notch, so delicious, especially the beef tendon tofu, which is absolutely amazing! The room design of the accommodation is so exquisite. I have stayed in many five-star hotels. Such exquisite design and art-integrated design are like being in an art palace! The Grand Hyatt is worthy of being a world-class hotel.

msg:It should be said that I am a person with relatively high requirements for hotels. Before choosing Grand Hyatt, I compared several hotels repeatedly. Although I saw some negative reviews, I finally chose Grand Hyatt based on various needs. After staying for two days, the feeling is "Next time I go to Hangzhou, I will still choose it!". Whether it is the location of the hotel or the quality of service, I think it matches its price. Because I am a person who is used to sleeping late, I didn't choose the hotel's breakfast, so I can't comment on its product. In short, my stay experience is very satisfactory!

msg:The second time I stayed at Grand Hyatt, the first time I stayed at the hotel, I sighed at the good location of the hotel and the stylish decoration, so I chose to stay for the second time, because the first time I could not go to the top floor Regency Club Executive Lounge without a day in the Regency Club room type. I specially booked the Regency Club Lake View Room, but the room was dusty and not clean, and the bedding was wet and not dry, and I don't understand why the Regency Club room type can go to the Executive Lounge for free drinks at any time, why the minibar in the room Can't drink for free? Isn't this the kind of service that Regency Club should have? I go to the Regency Club for free, why can't it be free in the room? From the doorman to the front desk everyone's service attitude is crazy and loves to live. When I asked about the minibar at the front desk, I was very disdainful and told me that the Park Hyatt Group is like this, which means that the Park Hyatt Group is better than any hotel. mean? Does it mean that it is very low for other hotel executive room types to send minibar? There is also the doorman. I just came out of the hotel to find the takeaway brother and said that I have to put it in the concierge. The doorman has to stop me or I have to scan the code to enter. I said I just came out. Scan the code in 10 seconds at the door? He said it was requested by the Epidemic Prevention Office. I asked him to show me the red-headed document from the Epidemic Prevention Office. He said he said it verbally. First of all, if it is true, I would walk around the door smoking a cigarette with my left foot, then turn around and go back. Will he let me scan the code a hundred times? In the end, is the epidemic prevention training of hotel staff not in place, or is the hotel staff overweight and misunderstood the country's intention? Isn't the purpose of the venue code to know who went in that day? What's the point of scanning the venue code 100 times on the same day when I go in and out 100 times a day? The hotel location is good, the room is good, the environment is good, the price is not cheap, is maintenance and service and the mood of the guests not important?

msg:Stayed for three days before and after the Grand Hyatt Hotel and did not encounter the legendary room upgrade. Overall, I am generally satisfied.

Environment: The biggest advantage. The location of the hotel is excellent, it is very convenient to travel, eat, and play. There is a nucleic acid point at the door, and it is very convenient to continue life.

Hygiene: The hygiene of the room is good, and I didn't find any discomfort.

Facilities: The facilities are a little old-fashioned, the toilet is not smart, and the mattress feels a little softer. The windows of the room are sealed and cannot be opened, so the air conditioner can only be turned on all the time.

Service: The staff at the front desk are good. The window of the room that I gave at the beginning is loud against the ventilation equipment. After negotiation, I changed the room to a different location, and I feel much better. I noticed that You Qi had a girl named Liu Qiong, who made people feel like a spring breeze. The room service staff was probably too busy and sometimes a little sloppy. I stayed for three nights. On the first day, I found that there was no soap in the bathroom, no hand towel on the second day, and no shower cap on the third day. They are all very small places. When I found out that I didn't use them, I couldn't help but complain. In addition, there are no body lotions and mouthwashes that hotels at this price generally provide, and bath salts and bathtub sets are only given after you ask for them, which feels a bit petty. The bottled water is replenished with six bottles every day, which well meets the needs of drinking tea in the room.

Because I took my kids there on the weekend and the time was short, I wanted to choose a convenient place. And we also booked it at the last minute, so when I booked the hotel, I saw this hotel with good scenery and good location. Although there was only a twin room (the reviews said the bed was very small), I also booked it. I checked in at 2:30 and asked if it was the same as the picture I booked. The waiter said arrogantly that it was impossible. I said, should I ask why Ctrip put such a picture? Then he looked me up and down (his eyes made me very uncomfortable). Shouldn't I ask questions? Then she said she would give me a big bed but it hadn't been cleaned yet, it would be after 3:30, I thought maybe I had to wait too long so she gave me an upgrade, I took my kids out to eat and went back around 4:40, when I was queuing at the front desk I was inexplicably taken to the 8th floor to check in, the waiter took us to the elevator and swiped our cards and told us to go by ourselves, there were other people in the elevator at the time so I was too embarrassed to press the elevator and ask, so I went up to the 8th floor like a headless fly and found some VIP Club, so it was 5 o'clock, I found the waiter, she was still so arrogant, I gave my ID card and she made two phone calls and let me wait stupidly, she didn't say what, at this time another waiter came, she asked if there was a room, we exchanged glances, she told me it wasn't ready yet and I had to wait, she treated me like a **, couldn't you see the look in her eyes? I couldn't stand it because I had my kids with me and had to do homework, after I argued with her, she said in a condescending tone that she would give me the room that was originally given to someone else, haha, I really thought I was valuable because I worked in a 5-star hotel~ I spent 2,700 and felt the waiter's cold eyes, it was really enough

It is worth mentioning that the 28 restaurant downstairs is not for business banquets, so don‚Äôt try it. It‚Äôs really unpalatable. I went hungry and spent a few thousand. I ate a bunch of dishes and half. Satisfy yourself and experience it, but Mrs. Song's fish soup is quite tasty. The hotel lobby is smoky and full of people. It's too messy.
As soon as the children in the family tent room entered the room, they were refreshed twice and never went out again, haha.

Unexpectedly, every customer who entered and exited the room could clearly hear the voice of the aisle, and the frequent customers could not sleep due to the noise. A five-star hotel has such a bad effect on the diaphragm! There is also unqualified sanitation, the toilet cover is not wiped clean, and the stools on the terrace are very dirty.

msg:I don't know why there are so many bad reviews. I almost decided to decide on this hotel after reading these bad reviews, but in the end, I couldn't find a suitable hotel around the West Lake. Whether it's the Four Seasons or the State Guest House, it's like a big house. It's been a long time since I lived where I lived. It's suitable for a hotel, but it's really not suitable for this short-term trip. Going downstairs is the West Lake, next to Intime Shopping Center, and going downstairs is the nucleic acid point, which is so convenient! After checking in in the afternoon, I will take a cruise directly at the entrance, swim in the West Lake in the middle of the sunset, and watch the night view of the West Lake on the balcony of the top floor and the West Lake Longjing in the evening. Go to the Hamley Children's City next to the Grand Hyatt to buy toys... within easy reach of eating, drinking, and having fun! You can also feed squirrels at the door.

You can go boating on the water, take a tour bus around the lake, and enjoy the famous attractions of the West Lake. Behind the hotel is a bustling commercial district. You can shop and feast on Hangzhou delicacies. Therefore, it is extremely convenient to live here, to play by the lake, to shop in the commercial street, and to enjoy delicious food. More importantly, the hotel's management and service personnel are well-trained, from doormen, cleaning personnel to upper management personnel, all of them are polite to the guests. If you have any difficulties, they will do their best to help you solve them. For example, this time we had unexpected difficulties with check-in. Ms. Du Qianqian from the guest house on the eighth floor immediately called around to comfort us not to worry. Our difficulties were quickly resolved. This conscientious and responsible hospitality made us really feel at home. The restaurant is also well run. Every time you eat, the restaurant staff will give you a warm reception and lead you to the available table. The service staff at the Regency Restaurant on the eighth floor are even more attentive and enthusiastic. The dining environment is quiet and elegant. If you are willing to eat on the balcony, you will be faced with the sparkling West Lake, which will make you feel refreshed and increase your appetite. The management of the guest house is very organized, and the team service concept is very advanced. We will come again next time!

There was a strong smell of inferior disinfectant, which took an hour to dissipate! The guard at the door saw the old man pushing the wheelchair and deliberately avoided it. The corridor on the 6th floor is filled with the stench of sewers, and the toilet in room 666 has a disgusting smell of sewers. The breakfast buffet has few varieties and poor taste. The hotel probably has so many guests because of its good location, right? I really don't recommend everyone to stay, because the management of this hotel is destined to not be able to receive so many guests!

This trip to Hangzhou is the first time I stayed at the Grand Hyatt Hotel. Because there are activities in the off-season hotel, I booked a two-night guest house room with high cost performance. When we deliver to the hotel, the concierge will warmly open the door for us to take our luggage. The front desk staff is also warm and thoughtful. Although the room is not very big, it is spacious and bright. The three of us adults do not feel crowded at all and can see the lake view. Breakfast and dinner It is very rich. Whether it is the waiter in the lounge on the eighth floor or the waiter in the restaurant on the first floor, they are very polite and enthusiastic. The cleaning staff will also take the initiative to greet us. Compared with those arrogant waiters in five-star hotels in Shanghai, they are really heavenly. Underground, this is probably why I prefer Hangzhou. The location of the hotel is excellent. The West Lake is just outside the door. If it weren't for the epidemic, you should be able to see the musical fountain. The most important point is that there is a nucleic acid test at the entrance of the hotel. It's so friendly to us out-of-town tourists. The trip to Hangzhou was very pleasant, and the Grand Hyatt Hotel left us with a very good impression. We will stay here in the future when we come to Hangzhou.

msg:This is my second stay, the heating is too hot, and this problem also happened last time, I suggest the hotel take it seriously

A cooling fan is added at night, but it is easy to catch a cold if it is blown like this overnight, because the whole room is too stuffy

To be honest, I would rather turn down the heating. If there are residents who are cold, it may be better to use a heater. There are no other problems

The view is not bad, although the swimming pool covers most of the West Lake in the room 444 I live in, but I can still see some

The shower control in the room should be installed in the wrong direction. I tried a few times, but I just had to turn it in the opposite direction. It didn‚Äôt work on the first night, the water was not adjusted properly, and the shower was quite cold

msg:A long time ago, I stayed at this hotel many times when it was still Hyatt, and this is the first time I stayed after it was upgraded to Grand Hyatt. The overall feeling is still good, can play 4.5 points. The half points deducted are at two points:

1) When I checked in, there were a lot of people and it was very chaotic. I was waiting in line in an orderly manner. Many people regarded me as nothing, and swaggered past me and went directly to the counter, but no one stopped this scene. I had to do the same, skip the line and go straight to the counter. It's not like a luxury hotel style, it's more like a free market. Hope this can be improved.

2) Although the room is a non-smoking room, there is a smell of smoke in it. It is very obvious when you first enter the door. I think it is probably because it was a smoking room before? To make matters worse, the windows wouldn't open to circulate the air inside.

Apart from the above two points, everything else is fine.

The biggest advantage of the hotel is its location. The hotel is located on Hubin Road, facing the West Lake Fountain. It has a beautiful view and is close to the bustling area. Morning and night, walking by the lake is indescribably pleasant. Hubin Pedestrian Street, Intime 77, and Longxiangqiao Metro Station are all within walking distance. It is convenient to go shopping and gourmet food.

There is a nucleic acid testing point at the entrance of the hotel. At this time, it is also part of the convenience facilities.

If you like to be close to the West Lake and have the convenience of eating and shopping, then Grand Hyatt is one of the best choices.

msg:Hangzhou Grand Hyatt is definitely the worst five-star hotel I've ever lived in, no one!
When you got off the car and entered the hotel, the waiter looked at you with two suitcases and a child, but he just looked and didn't offer any help!
I took the initiative to ask him to help, but he was reluctant!
It was 6:00 pm when I checked in. I asked if I could check out late, but the front desk actually said a word. Don't you see that many people can't arrange to take the room now?
I'm speechless, this is a problem of your hotel's incompetence due to improper arrangements, and is it related to customers?
The room is also pitifully small. I originally thought I could see the lakeside, but who knew that I could only see a little bit of the city view. Besides, which five-diamond hotel does not have an automatic toilet board?
Except for the luxurious lobby, the rest of the supporting facilities are like ordinary hotels. Lake Wanghu Garden said that it was closed because of the epidemic. Only customers of Regency Club can see the West Lake! So I ordered a lonely one?
In the end, when I checked out that day, the front desk told me that if the car exceeds 6 o'clock, I can come back and get a parking coupon, and it is still free parking! I went to pick up the car at 9 o'clock that day. When I went to the front desk, the front desk made things difficult for me, and finally said aggrieved, let it go! How about a five-diamond hotel costing 2,000 a night, is it worth supporting this kind of service? Absolutely the worst five diamonds ever!

msg:The overall best thing about the LaCrosse Hotel is the location. It is convenient to eat and play around, and it is opposite the West Lake. However, it is an old hotel after all. Many hardware and services cannot keep up. It is understandable that the rooms are smaller, but the services are really not up to date. For example There are many people waiting in line for breakfast, but the service cannot keep up with the user experience. Although there are many people during the Spring Festival, the house price has also risen. This is not the reason for the poor service. The front desk staff is also lack of temperature. The most hateful thing is the door When the security guard saw us driving in, he questioned us without a smile, and asked what we were doing here. I said that the hotel insisted on asking me if the room was open? I feel bad about the hotel I booked through. Is this a five-star hotel? Have you trained in service etiquette?

Besides the traffic, taking a taxi to go out is very congested, because it is the peak holiday season, there is only one way to go out, and the car has to give way to pedestrians all the time, so it is very congested.

I proposed where to go first, open the lobby seating, and eat when there is a seat. This male boss with glasses, Eddie, you are rude and respectful to the guests, and even eat in the lobby. You can't eat in the restaurant if there are seats in the restaurant. Is this the service attitude and standard you should have in a star-rated hotel? ! What a great authority! The key is that when you enter the restaurant, you find that there are many empty tables and no one is allowed to enter! I'm eating in your high-end lobby, with my Birkin bag, is it worthy of your high-end lobby? ! Advise everyone to stay away from this hotel very bad! !

1. Wait until the check-in time is almost 3 o'clock and change to a room full of 4, and I won't negotiate with you in advance. Five-star hotels are so careless now?
2. Just after cleaning, it still smells like the last customer ate takeaway, and the toiletry items are all gone. It took 40 minutes to get it on the phone.
3. The small refrigerator is empty. When asked about the impact of the epidemic in Shanghai, I said that this is Hangzhou. How come these mineral waters are still specially supplied by Shanghai? With you, you are starting to receive guests from Shanghai. Do you have a few bottles of mineral water?
What can I say in the end, the store is bullying customers, I don‚Äôt recommend everyone to come, many people in the lobby don‚Äôt wear masks, there are several Shanghai yellow codes, and they joke that I am a yellow code. Results, hehe.

msg:The experience of staying at Hangzhou Grand Hyatt this time was very poor, which subverted my view of the brand hotel. From the time of check-in, the room can only be cleaned at 16:30. There is no solution, only waiting. When I checked out, I had to invoice the wrong amount twice. After tossing for a long time, I finally told me that the invoice should be issued on Ctrip. I was drunk. On the catering side, I ordered a buffet dinner for 4 persons, 358 persons. There are no expensive ingredients. The most expensive should be salmon. It is very common. Crayfish is provided. Since there are no disposable gloves, the waiter took a few pairs for surgery. Give me the medical gloves, I am speechless, all the food stalls have disposable gloves. The overall value for money is not high. Two bottles of shampoo were given to me in the guest room toiletries. There was no shower gel. I only discovered it after taking a shower. In the end, I didn't use the shower gel after washing, and I was speechless. No management personnel contacted us to solve the problem during the whole process. I have to give feedback through Ctrip customer service. Ctrip customer service is very efficient in handling problems. I like it.

Great value. The younger brother at the front desk spoke softly and upgraded the Regency Club Lake View Room. The room was relatively compact, and it was a little nervous for two people to live. Fortunately, the view was wide. Arrived late, missed the lunch buffet, went to the 1st floor in the afternoon and ordered salad and coffee. At 6 o'clock in the evening, I went to the Regency Club on the 8th floor to drink some wine and eat some desserts and vegetables. The service of the young lady was very good, she helped pour the wine and ice cubes, reminded us that there were flying insects outside, and we had dinner indoors and then went out to the rooftop to blow air. After drinking more than 7 o'clock, the lady came out to remind them that the food and wine service was about to end, and asked us if we wanted to add more wine. Especially considerate. The buffet breakfast the next morning was very rich, and I was very full. After breakfast, I checked out and went to work. It's a pity that I didn't eat lunch. Find an excuse to stay again next time.

During the epidemic, you can only play in the city.
The big bed is two big and one small, but it still feels a little small.
Not sleeping very well.
Health, service, transportation, location are perfect.
Say hello to the front desk in advance on your birthday, as if there is a small cake.
We didn't make a reservation this time. The receptionist at the front desk quickly arranged a box of chocolates after knowing the child's birthday that day.
It tastes good and feels very homey.
The general category of breakfast is not very rich.
But enough to eat. Freshly squeezed juices are delicious.
I forgot to bring a swimsuit this time, sorry.
Must bring it next time.
The swimming pool looks comfortable and clean.
Overall very satisfied.
Worth reviewing next time.

If you like to walk, you can walk along the West Lake on the right side and you can reach Beishan Street. The housing experience was very good.

This should be the second time I stayed this month. It seemed that there was no evaluation of the applet last time, so I have commented here. The experience of these two stays is very good. The whole hotel staff are polite, especially Ms. Hu, the front office manager who I met during the two stays, arranged the room very well according to my request, and even went to the 8th floor during HH. Come. There are also reception Miss Li several times asking for help I need. The Regency Club on the 8th floor is my favorite lounge in the Hangzhou hotel, especially watching the sunset over the West Lake from the terrace. The lady in charge of the Regency Club with short hair was very enthusiastic and helped me take care of my daughter. The room decoration of the hotel after G20 is also very comfortable to live in. Lying on the big sofa and watching the West Lake, it feels so good to be empty! A little request hope that the breakfast will not change due to the epidemic.

msg:The advantages and disadvantages of Hangzhou Grand Hyatt are quite obvious. For reference, the advantages: 1. Good location, adjacent to the West Lake, Lakeside Intime in77, basically all walks are covered for eating, drinking, and entertainment, and the car has not moved. The hotel lobby, Chinese restaurant, gym and other facilities and environments are basically worthy of the Junyue brand. During the epidemic, the hotel entrance inspection was very serious, but the garage prevention and control post was basically virtual, and people came in and out casually. The breakfast was good, and the dishes in the Chinese restaurant were also very good. . It's just that the room is a bit inconsistent with this price, the area is small, the room that is not facing the lake is a messy corner outside the window, not to mention the scenery, the sun can't be seen. There is also a Grand Hyatt toilet that is not equipped with washlet and seat cushion heating, which is a bit naive. All in all, the location is excellent, which can save a lot of trouble, but I feel that the Grand Hyatt Hangzhou has basically invested its money in the decoration and facilities of public areas, and the inves**ent in general rooms is really not enough, and some places are not as good as new ones. The room configuration of the Atour Orange Crystal Express Hotel. Grand Hyatt, who has lived in many places, trusts this brand and basically did not disappoint me. Hangzhou is a relatively developed city, and it is on the edge of the West Lake landmark. I hope the hotel management can consider more rooms for the guests to live in directly. It is for reference only. If there is anything that is not objective, it is purely personal opinion. In general, the hotel is still one of the best in the West Lake. There are better hotels in Hangzhou than him, but the location may not be as good as him, and the location is better. Yes, but the quality is not as good as his, that's basically it, choose for yourself.

The hotel, I have to say, the location is excellent, the check-in staff at the front desk is too unprofessional, and does not match the Grand Hyatt. I took the children and the elderly out to play and booked two rooms. We arrived at the front desk of the hotel before 12:50 to check in. At this time, only one room was clean, and the other room was not ready. The front desk staff said to check in both rooms, give one room first, and then get the room card after the other is cleaned. Then we went out for lunch at a nearby restaurant. The meal process takes about 60 minutes, and it is almost 2 o'clock when we return to the hotel. I went to the front desk to get the room key card, the staff said that it would take 20 minutes to wait, I was about to pack up, and the key card would be sent to the room when it was done. Our family went up to rest, and then after 40 minutes, I called the front desk to ask if the other room was ready, and told the name and a room number that had been obtained for the reservation of two rooms. The front desk did not know, communicated One round, and then when she clearly knew that the other room number did not get the room card, she said to ask someone to get it for me. I waited in my room for about ten minutes before delivery, because the elderly and children were a little tired in the car and kept making noises about going to sleep. I called and continued to ask if the room card was delivered. The amazing thing was that the front desk didn't know about it. Tell the occupant's name, and do not know which room it is. Then he said, our check-in is at three o'clock, my god, why didn't you tell me three o'clock when I checked in for the first time, if you tell me, I can make another arrangement, it's really funny, there is no work If you don't do it well, put the responsibility on the guests to come to the hotel in advance? The key is that you didn't say it when you checked in. When you got the room card for the first time, you clearly told it that it would be 20 minutes later. It was really an inexplicable experience. In the end, when I got angry, the room card was delivered in about five minutes.

If you encounter a cold front desk, the service is cold and you don't feel welcome. Compared with Soft's service, it is cold and impersonal. Didn't feel welcome. The room attendant was very stingy, and gave a bar of soap to the room for three days. Eco-friendly vs value for money? Mineral water is the farmer's, not Evian.
The service of the steak bar is very good. I feel that the service is professional and caring, and I feel that I and my family are particularly respected.

The hotel is old and the hardware is aging. Only by relying on more enthusiastic, thoughtful, caring and heart-infused services can we impress people. Will not come to this hotel again next time.

The location is really convenient, and it is very close to the shopping mall and the hotel. Ctrip can check it. I have not given a bad review, but yesterday I did not understand One thing itself, we came back very late. Before checking in, we asked the front desk if we could help with takeout delivery upstairs, because it was not very comfortable. The front desk replied that it could be too late. At that time, the attitude was very bad. When I went downstairs to pick up the takeaway, I asked a man who was standing at the concierge at the time. I guess it was the phone he answered. Hello, where is the takeaway? I walked a few steps and asked again and told me that the service attitude is extremely poor. The attitude of ignoring the answer is very unpleasant. This check-in experience is really bad. The service is really important. I just read the replies to a few bad reviews. It doesn't affect the basics. Maybe everyone will choose the store and there will be no shortage of customers, but I hope it will really improve

1. The room was understaffed, which caused the room to be done very slowly. We checked in at 2 pm that day, and only got the room card to check in at 5 pm.
2, the 7th floor and the 8th floor can smell the fumes, maybe there is a problem with the flue
3. The mini bar on the executive floor is not free, it seems very small
4. I actually called before 12:00 noon the next day to urge check-out, and the executive floor does not enjoy the late check-out service, which is not a good feeling. Although we ended up checking out at early 2:00, the customer experience was obviously not good compared to making us wait 3 hours to check in.

msg:To give this score to the Grand Hyatt Hotel, I still struggled for a long time. To sum up the three-day stay experience, the hardware facilities look good, but there are indeed some problems; the service seems to be good, but it cannot be said that every employee has it. Seriously serving; crisis management seems to be handled but no sincerity is felt at all. The order is to talk about the facilities first. The location of the hotel is quiet in the middle of the noise. Next to it is Yintai, the Federation of Industry and Commerce, and Longxiang Bridge. It can meet all the needs of eating, drinking and entertainment. The hotel has been upgraded to the Regent Club, and the room on the 7th floor is next to it. The first photo The lake view seen from the window cannot be said to be perfect, nor can we complain that it is not seen or blocked, so we usually go to the terrace of the executive lounge upstairs to see the lake. See Figures 2 and 9 for the landscape. It meets the basic requirements of living by the West Lake, so it is reasonable to give it 80 points for the environment. Then talk about hygiene, um... Don't read this review while eating, I'm not very good right now. There is nothing wrong with the hygiene of the room, except that two hairs were found in the sewer, and there was a black thread under the quilt. In the sauna room and massage pool in the hotel's women's area, the air is full of sweat, urine and a sour smell mixed with something I don't know. When I went to change clothes, I almost fainted on the spot without being smoked, and there was no trace of deodorization work. I stayed for 3 days and swam 2 times. A child was probably more serious after choking on water and vomited in the swimming pool. I saw the staff scoop it up with a net. I couldn‚Äôt stand it anymore, so we hurriedly left. We checked out on the afternoon of February 3, and the room can be seen In the swimming pool, the water is not changed by sightü§Æ... can't go on, 2 stars for the room hygiene, others... Finally, let's talk about the service, the uncle of the concierge who helped with the luggage and the lady at the front desk who handled the check-in are both good and responsible. There are not many service staff in the executive lounge, and basic services are still available. We didn't eat at the hotel on New Year's Eve. We had dinner at the hotel on the first and second days of the new year. As a result, we ate a small plastic thread in a sauce duck or roast duck on the second day of the new year. It was obviously curled. I asked the service staff and they quickly took me The plate was taken away and didn't even give me a chance to take a photo. I came here twice and explained that when the bagged duck meat was unpacked, a little bit of the bag was cut into the meat... We chose to believe it, I think it's okay, but this However, according to the service of a five-star hotel according to international standards, your hygiene has been complained, and your explanation has been accepted. Is your service over? This is what I was talking about earlier, it seems that the crisis is dealt with, but nothing seems to be done. The 3-star service was given to the front desk, guest room, concierge, and executive lounge. It is not recommended to upgrade or choose.

The price of a double bed room during the summer vacation weekend is 1960 yuan (excluding breakfast), which is more expensive than the sea view room of a five-star hotel in Hong Kong Central during the Spring Festival before the epidemic! The room is small, the bed is small, the wooden floor of the room is dirty, and there are many mosquitoes in the room. I asked the waiter to send a pair of slippers and did not come for half an hour. The key is that this hotel has a good view on the 8th floor, and you can't go up unless you buy a 400 yuan breakfast coupon. Will not stay again.

msg:The room is forty square meters? Building area, the room is very cramped, and when I bowed to pack my luggage, I was bumped by the safe hanging in the air. What is this design? Does the safe need to be so ostentatious? The bed is very small, the windows can't be opened, not to mention the balcony. Of course, those with a balcony may belong to higher-level occupants, and they can enjoy the fruit plate that costs only a few dollars. I remember that we did not include breakfast. One night is 1844 Yuan, the fruit plate can account for three pieces. But I have to say that the location of the hotel is good, across the road is the most crowded place for tourists in the West Lake in summer. Another feature is that the restaurant is expensive. The Chinese restaurant I went to has ugly dishes. I ordered a few dishes from hundreds, one or two hundred, and there was fried rice. I was quite full, because the dishes were salty enough. Order mapo tofu, more than 550 orders. I was too tired to come back on the third day. I wanted to go to their cafeteria to eat something, but I asked 498 people and scared him away. However, the ice cream in the lobby on the first floor is good, 30 yuan for two balls,

On the first day, I drove to the door of the hotel. No one came to pick up my luggage. But when I was waiting at the Regency Club on the 8th floor, there was nothing to eat except juice! After finally getting the room card, I called the front desk to send my luggage, but no one answered after 3 or 4 calls? ! In addition, the room package booked includes lunch buffet. When I checked in at the front desk, I gave a meal coupon, but I didn't tell you to make an appoin**ent in advance. As a result, when I went at noon the next day, I was told that I had to wait until 1:30 to eat without making an advance reservation. Lunch! ! ! In short, this accommodation experience is indescribable. The main purpose of the service industry is not service!

In addition to the good location and proximity to the West Lake, there is no other advantage. There is no poor service, and the price and service do not match. After arriving at the hotel, the front desk checked in, and the waiter checked in while calling to deal with other things. Procrastinate to do other things, and there is no apology after the end. Calling the front desk and room service from the room phone is always busy and can't get through. There is no way but to call the hotel phone number on the Ctrip platform to ask why it can't get through. The hotel staff replied that I don't know either ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. What a five star service. Room service also does not have a turndown service.... Bad experience! The hotel staff were arrogant and rude and didn't say hello at all. Walking into the hotel for two days, the front desk people stood and chatted, and the guests asked if they could check in?

Facing the West Lake hotel, the lake view room is very nice.
The hotel is very responsible
When a customer wants to upgrade the room type, call me. When a customer sees the bill, call me because I am the one who swiped the card, the contact person is also the one who pays the money~Very good~
In addition, let‚Äôs talk about Ctrip‚Äôs customer service and consultation:
Ctrip's customer service is also very responsible
I have been using Ctrip for almost 5-6 years.
Two heart-warming things, the first time I booked a flight from Hangzhou to Harbin. Then the flight was overbooked... The airline company's problem I was still on the way to the airport, and Miss Ctrip called me... Tell me it was overbooked and go early...
The second time is today... I booked a room on another platform and went to check with the hotel to check whether it is necessary to have nucleic acid or nucleic acid. The hotel also helped the guest to make a reservation. The hotel said that we don‚Äôt have so much time to make phone calls one by one. We are very busy during the New Year. We are not obliged to inform the guests of check-in requirements. Nucleic acid! This kind of hotel is always black hahaha because I think there is a problem with the hotel, I wrote the merchant's words on the button to ask everyone under the review on Ctrip... Then the little brother of Ctrip called me and asked me what was wrong. I found out that I was someone else. The platform is set and I am not impatient to listen to my story and thank me for the feedback that I have a better understanding of the hotel situation. This is the second time
Like~
Because there is no picture of the Grand Hyatt I ordered for the guest, I will post a snow town ~ Mei Yimei. I hope it will snow soon in Hangzhou. I have a chance to see the photos of the West Lake snow scene at the Grand Hyatt. Hahaha

msg:This time I stayed at Grand Hyatt during the Chinese New Year. I was very disappointed. Both the hardware and software were extremely poor. The lake view was not satisfactory. Almost all rooms were blocked by the large disc at the door. The lake view room could only see a little bit of the lake view. It is recommended to bring a magnifying glass. The toiletries are common products produced in Guangzhou. The toilet flushes very little and needs to be operated twice. There is not even an exhaust fan in the bathroom. It is recommended to wear a mask when going to the bathroom. The bath water temperature cannot be adjusted to hot, and I almost caught a cold. The water quality of the swimming pool is also average. The middle-aged man at the front desk at the door is slick and hypocritically polite. It is obviously a standard corner room on the 6th floor with lake view. They deliberately said that they upgraded us and treated us as **. Not to mention that the buffet is unpalatable, the guests staying in the hotel are charged at the original price of 468, and they did not inform us in advance. It is not as good as Ctrip **'s discount of only 398. Staying in the hotel is still slaughtered. Compared with the ** State Guesthouse where I stayed a few days ago, it is much better. The toiletries are L'Occitane, the automatic flushing toilet and the separate pure water faucet, and a bunch of fruit milk snacks and facial masks are given. The buffet tastes good, and the guests staying in the hotel are discounted at 266. I really regretted changing to Grand Hyatt for the same price. There is no comparison and no harm. I will not stay here again.

Needless to say, the location is by the West Lake. The parking lot was renovated and temporarily parked on the third floor. The temporary elevator would often meet the chef who went to the second floor. He politely said hello every time. When you check in at the front desk, there will be a waiter who will guide you warmly, and you will be enthusiastic when you encounter it in the corridor. Say hello to the hotel immediately, (except for a young woman with an intern brand name in the lobby that is cold to customers, and met her again in the corridor, turning a blind eye to us and leaving, maybe the intern did not understand the hotel service The purpose of the concept) The room layout is the style you like, the bathroom is large, this is really liked, the sound insulation effect is quite good, you will definitely choose the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Hangzhou in the future.

It was about 11:30, and the room hadn't been cleaned. It might be the peak season. Originally, I had a good impression of the hotel, but when I came back to take a bath in the evening, something unpleasant happened. The manager dealt with it and changed our room in time. I went out to play the next day and came back in the evening, but I washed the puff and put it next to the sink. It was gone. I guess the aunt who was cleaned threw it away... Ahhhhhh... I called the customer service lady, the hotel did not have any spares. Yes...-Hey...it makes me a little irritable, who is already afraid of heat... The hotel parking lot is under renovation, but fortunately I didn't drive it. Next time, I shouldn't choose to live here...
