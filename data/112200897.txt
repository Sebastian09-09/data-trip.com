msg:I came to Gulangyu Island on a business trip and had a living experience that exceeded my expectations. The cost-effectiveness is very high. I recommend it.

Facilities: The design is simple. The landscape, green plants, lighting, architectural decoration design, and the selection of supplies are all simple and design-oriented. American business is online

Hygiene: Clean. Although it was rainy in summer, there were no bugs. It was very good

Environment: The environment is relatively quiet and the location is very good. You can directly see Trinity Church and the twin towers across the sea from the balcony

Service: The service of a five-star hotel many years ago is similar to that of a five-star hotel. Now many five-star hotels have lost this kind of service enthusiasm, but I actually recalled it in a homestay.

After arriving, the clerk was very enthusiastic. The person who received me seemed to be Xiao Zhang. He helped us take our luggage to the room, and then enthusiastically introduced the facilities of the room to us and answered our questions enthusiastically. Thank you very much.
Facilities: We are very satisfied with this price. Everything is available.
Hygiene: Clean, the sheets, quilts and pillows are up to the standard.
Environment: Quiet and comfortable. The melodious singing from Trinity Church the next day also made people feel comfortable.
In addition, it rained when I was leaving. Because there were children, I tentatively asked Xiao Zhang if there was an umbrella. He said that the hotel didn‚Äôt have one, but there was one left by a previous guest for others who needed it. We gave it to him, which was very touching. In short, I will only stay in this hotel when I come to Gulangyu in the future. Thank you for your service. See you again.
Exquisite afternoon tea for two: great
Sleep aid set: very thoughtful
I also gave a souvenir when I left.

msg:Since you have to walk all the way to Gulangyu, it is not easy to find a hotel for the first time. Fortunately, the housekeeper sent a video, just follow it. If you have a lot of luggage, you still have to walk. Don't go into the air-raid shelter.

Environment:
Not bad, the reeds in the yard are very beautiful, and the room has some design. We are on the first floor, and someone is talking in the corridor near the bedroom window. I can hear it very clearly, as if it is soundproof. Opposite is Trinity Church, which is convenient for taking pictures. There is a black cat in the yard, which is pretty.

Hygiene:
To be honest, the room rate on the 2nd is not low, higher than most five-star hotels in Xiamen, almost the same as Marriott Renaissance Hotel. After the holidays, the price is very affordable. This increase is a bit surprising. For a homestay of this price, there are patches of spots on the sofa as soon as you enter the room, which makes people very unhappy.

Facilities:
Wifi: The speed is very average, and the TV still needs to be handled before it can connect to the Internet.

Exquisite double afternoon tea:
Very rich, rarely see such a rich afternoon tea.

Service:
If it weren't for the housekeeper, the score would definitely be lower. On the one hand, the attitude was very good. After we expressed our love for Su Xiaotang's candies, the housekeeper gave us a lot of them enthusiastically. On the other hand, breakfast didn't start until 8 o'clock, which was already very late. It was not ready at 8 o'clock, which was very unfriendly to tourists who wanted to get up early and avoid the crowds.

It was 6 o'clock in the evening when we arrived at Gulangyu. After booking the hotel, someone from the hotel immediately contacted me and sent a video and precautions for going to the hotel from the pier. When we arrived that day, the front desk lady saw that we were 2 adults and 1 child, and directly upgraded our room and carried our luggage to the room. The key is to personally explain to me that there are mosquito repellent and hanging irons in the room, and the drinks in the small bar are all given to guests. The explanation is clear and the service is in place. On the day of check-out, because the children didn't want to leave after playing, the check-out time was delayed. They also arranged transition time and arranged afternoon tea for us in advance. Every detail is taken care of directly, the hotel environment is also very beautiful, the room is clean, and the breakfast and afternoon tea are simply perfect. All friends, just go directly

The afternoon tea carefully prepared by the housekeeper is comfortable and cozy no matter how you taste it. The public terrace is very large, with green plants, flowers, and fountains. Friends who like a slow pace can stay longer! The exquisite environment of the restaurant is also very good, and you can dine inside and outside. The waiter specially fried a large plate of bacon for the children. The housekeepers and waiters are very friendly, enthusiastic and attentive. The mini bar in the room can be refilled at will, and friends of all ages who love to drink can drink it now. I sincerely recommend that you and your loved ones pick up a glass and drink wine on the balcony when the whole Gulangyu Island is quiet at night! The beautiful scenery is in full view, and the beautiful mood comes by appoin**ent! More beautiful hotels are waiting for everyone to discover!

She asked me to go back to my room (my room is on the third floor). Then she said that it would delay her from get off work. This has happened before! Then I was forced to go out and use the public toilet in the scenic spot! When I woke up the next morning, there were obviously not enough staff at the breakfast area. There was basically no one in sight. But the attitude of the service staff is very good, but there is obviously a shortage of manpower. The service still needs to be improved.

The portions were large and pleasing to the eye. Breakfast was served in a buffet style. It was probably too late to arrive at the restaurant and there was not much food if we didn't make up for it. It can be seen that the equipment, facilities and appliances have been carefully selected to match the building decoration style. If I have the opportunity to visit Gulangyu Island, I will choose to stay here again!

Service: From the moment we arrived, the waiter was very enthusiastic to check us in, gave us two hand-drawn maps, and also enthusiastically led us to the room. Then the hotel provides free afternoon tea, and the waiters are also very enthusiastic. When we returned to the hotel in the evening, we found that the air conditioner was not heating. The waiter was very proactive in helping us solve the problem, which was great. Because we started early in the morning, we didn't make it in time for breakfast. The waiter was very attentive and prepared a take-out breakfast for us, but we didn't ask for it. It was really great. Worth coming again.

The environment of the B&B is beautiful. It can be seen that the owner is very considerate in the design. The back garden is also very beautiful. We booked a family room on the first floor. Because we were traveling with elderly children and a lot of luggage this time, the hotel very considerately arranged for staff to go to the pier to help. We responded and provided a delicious afternoon tea before leaving. The convenience of breakfast needs to be strengthened. We said breakfast would be at 10 o'clock when we came down at 9:20. When we came down at 9:20, all the wontons, stewed eggs, steamed buns and other breakfast items in the lobby were empty. I asked if we could I was told that there was no more, and even the coffee cup was used up. After waiting for ten minutes, I couldn‚Äôt eat the side dishes that were served. My child wanted to toast the bread and waited for five minutes and the machine did not heat it. In the end, I only ate one piece of bread. For more than a thousand dollars The standard breakfast provided with the room rate is really the most speechless experience ever.

I would like to share our experience with you from several aspects: the store communicated with us in advance and thoughtfully reminded us of the check-in time and the ferry ticket time to Gulangyu Island, which was very thoughtful; the hotel is in an excellent location, in the Trinity Hall Opposite, right at the exit of Bishan Cave, I walked out of the cave and smelled the sweet fragrance of butter. I looked up and saw the bright flowers on the wall of Trinity Hall. At this time, Linggan Anyu Hotel was waiting for us quietly opposite; we opened the door and were greeted by the beautiful flowers on the wall. What we see is a romantic and warm French villa. The big dogtail grass swaying in the wind seems to be welcoming us. After taking off the hard work of the journey, we sit in the yard and soak in the sunshine and squint at the hazy grass stretching freely in the breeze. We feel happy. Health; the store arranged for us a room with a balcony in the small white building. Pushing the door is the Trinity Church. If it is Sunday, you can also see people worshiping in the church, sitting on the sunny balcony and looking at the blue sky. Feeling the warm and humid air from the Pacific Ocean, time slows down. At this time, the exquisite afternoon tea arrives as scheduled. Everything is the best arrangement. Enjoy the moment and the light joy brought by Anyu; listen to the hotels in Anyu The design is full of modern romantic a**osphere, every angle is full of design sense, and the photos taken during the trip are also very brilliant. I like it from the bottom of my heart, and I hope you can find an exclusive romantic and happy trip of your own.

msg:I chose this hotel for my trip to Gulangyu Island. The service attitude was good, but the service standard was not as good as expected.

Exquisite Afternoon Tea for Two: I tried the afternoon tea first when I arrived. It was rich in content, but the dessert selection was very average, dry and not delicious.

In-store travel photography takes 30 minutes, and you get 5 selected photos: the travel photographer is very punctual, has qualified equipment and technology, and will also guide you in taking photos. The price is 30 yuan per photo for more than 5 photos, but does not include photo retouching.

Facilities: The balcony of the balcony room is actually a public area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel and is not private. If you mind, don't choose this room. The bathtub in the room is nice and the bedding is soft.

Next comes the big complaint: I pay great attention to breakfast when choosing a resort hotel, but my experience in this hotel was terrible! We went at nine o'clock on time. The buffet table was already empty. When I asked the waiter, he shook his head helplessly. There was nothing he could do. The coffee machine had been down due to continuous use (it can be seen that it was not for commercial use), and there were no options for the set meal. Pickles, salted fish, white porridge. I think a hotel at this price in Gulangyu Island should not be of such a standard.

During peak seasons and holidays, choose your hotel carefully. It is recommended to strengthen management and increase manpower during periods of heavy traffic.

I sincerely recommend that every friend who goes to the island spend one night on Gulangyu Island to experience the tranquility and tranquility of the island at night and early morning. charm

This time I experienced his new store Linggan¬∑Anyu on the island. The whole building was originally an old building with a history of a hundred years. It has well preserved the original Minnan characteristics of the building. The memory of the 'ancient house' finally made me feel... Presented in the modern wabi-sabi style that I love so much

Because the island is purely walkable, I personally pay more attention to the location and comfort of the accommodation. The hotel is near Trinity Hall and very close to the two piers to the island! When you open the door, you can overlook the Twin Towers on the other side and the island's landmark Sunlight Rock. When the weather is nice, you can sit on the sofa in front of the room and quietly enjoy the sunrise and sunset. It is an ideal island life! The public areas of the hotel are also great for taking photos. When the weather gets cooler, I can spend a whole day here in a daze.

From check-in to check-out, I can really experience the attentiveness of the hotel's butler-style service, from toiletries to sleeping bedding, as well as the tableware and presentation of afternoon tea and breakfast. I really like it, which really makes the stay comfortable. Score a lot! Mosquito repellent water, welcome fruits, check-out souvenirs, candle lighting ceremony at night, small details are more touching! I can‚Äôt help but give Amway to my friends who plan to visit the island during the Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day!

msg:The location of the hotel is very good. It is very convenient to reach various attractions. The facilities are also very new. I like the style. One person and two children stayed there for three days and experienced three different rooms, each with its own characteristics. Children's toiletries are provided every day, which are cute and complete!
From the front desk to the service staff, they are all enthusiastic and attentive, especially the store manager and the little girl at the front desk, who will come immediately if needed!
The only drawback is that it would be nice to have a richer breakfast or change it slightly every day!

msg:Autumn, when it starts to slowly turn yellow, always makes Gulangyu Island look more charming.
Just because I accidentally caught a glimpse of this hotel in my circle of friends, I had the idea of ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äãtaking a vacation in my heart.
.
The listening room placed in Trinity Hall is some distance away from the noisy street. There is the comfort of being quiet amidst the noise.
The small fountain and crystal lantern at the entrance, as well as the blue doors and windows in the house, all have the temperament of Southern France.
The restaurant retains the stone room design of the ancient house, with a furnace lamp at the door and plain pottery inside. It echoes the design of the room and perfectly fits the design aesthetic of a wabi-sabi hotel in my mind.
If you want to relax, the hotel is enough for you to stay all day.
The surrounding green trees heal the mood. The Twin Towers can be seen from the house, and all the scenery can be enjoyed.
.
I give it the No.1 hotel stay this year.
It can make every detail eye-catching enough without following the clich√© internet celebrity style.
Extremely simple, extremely beautiful, and ultimate.

The location of the hotel is also very good. It takes less than seven minutes to walk to Longtou Road for dinner. I live in the newly opened building at the back door, and the waiters inside are all young men with a strong sense of service.

The hotel is located in the center of Gulangyu Island. You can see the sea and the Twin Towers landmark of Xiamen Island on the left at a glance, and it is adjacent to Sunlight Rock on the right. From check-in to check-out, the housekeeper made careful arrangements, and provided seasonal fruits and tea in the room. Every step was thoughtful and enthusiastic.

The overall style is modern wabi-sabi style, with antique exterior walls and warm lamps, which are simple and full of design. The green plants that can be seen everywhere outside the house have shed the coldness of the stone, and the overall feeling of home is more like returning to memories. The ancient house inside~

Walk around the island, look at the sea, and empty your head. When I woke up the next morning, a ray of sunshine came through the window. I really wished that time would stop and settle like this~

The hotel is in a very good location, just a 10-minute walk from the Piano Pier.

The room is fully equipped, and you can overlook the Twin Towers, a landmark building in Xiamen, when you open the door! I only stayed for one night, but I also felt the warm and considerate service of the butler!

The complimentary afternoon tea and breakfast are very characteristic of southern Fujian and taste great.

Gulangyu Island is really beautiful
The hotel I stayed in this time was renovated from a century-old building, retaining the simple exterior walls of the historical building. On the other hand, it also incorporated modern design inspiration. It‚Äôs the Shanji Fengcui I like very much!
We lived on the third floor, and the beautiful scenery outside the window made me linger. The Twin Towers and Trinity Hall were right in front of me.
You need to go through a small balcony to enter. Sitting on the balcony at night, looking at the Twin Towers, it's like a dream. I also love the window sofa at the entrance, it has a bit of a Nanyang retro flavor! The baby loves to sit on the sofa and look at the jungle in the back.
The restaurant and tableware are in ancient style and full of ritual feeling
Recommended to friends who come to Xiamen during National Day to enjoy the beautiful scenery quietly
/:lvuNote:
1. Gulangyu Island ferry tickets need to be reserved in advance, including round-trip tickets. You only need to line up 20 minutes in advance to come back.
2. Take the bus to Sanqiutian Pier

The clerk reminded us promptly and booked the tickets a week in advance to ensure a smooth trip to the island. Before going to the island, the clerk sent us a complete route map to the hotel. It was super comfortable to talk to the clerk. Everyone will know Say hello to each other.
Hygiene: The floor is made of dark brown wood and the walls are solid. The bed is much larger than the Hanting where we stayed on Zhongshan Road. My friend and I both found the bed very comfortable. The bathroom is also very clean
Environment: I saw a lot of hotels before. While visiting the island, I could see the appearance of some hotels I wanted to choose. Many of them were in the alleys. This one was very easy to find. My friend and I were very lucky to stay here. One family. Gulangyu Island is suitable for a slow stroll, and you can calm down and take a look at the firecrackers, bougainvillea, and every Nanyang-style building on the island. I think the architecture on the island is more charming than the sea.

From checking in to guiding the island's food, she is very attentive. Her service attitude is patient and responsive, and she responds to almost every request. I was not feeling well all morning, and the front desk immediately rushed to help me buy cold medicine, which touched me very much. I have stayed in so many hotels, and this is the first time I have encountered such a considerate front desk. It is really heartwarming. In addition, the hotel facilities are also very good. Especially the wet and dry separation design, the bath, toilet and sink are separated, which is very considerate.
In terms of location, the hotel is very convenient. Opposite is Trinity Hall, and within a few minutes there is a small street for eating, drinking and entertainment, which is very convenient. If I have the opportunity to come to Xiamen again, I will definitely choose to stay in this hotel again!

msg:As a traveler, I like to look for hotels that are unique, and Linggan Anyu Hotel fully meets my expectations. First of all, it has a unique geographical location, located between Xiamen Island and Gulangyu Island. Looking out of the window, I can see the Sunshine Rock and the magnificent Twin Towers facing each other on the same level. I seem to be surrounded by this magnificent scenery, and my mood becomes peaceful and comfortable.
The architectural style of Anyu Hotel is unique and fascinating. It combines century-old old buildings with modern wabi-sabi style elements, giving people a sense of beauty that blends old and new. Walking through the quaint exterior wall, I saw blue windows, old wood, stones and other details, which made me feel as if I had returned to the embrace of southern Fujian traditional culture. The warm lamps that light up in the space make the whole environment more cozy, which appropriately awakens the memory of "house" in Fujian. In such an environment, I felt the harmonious coexistence between history and modernity.
Hygiene is one of the most important factors when I choose a hotel, and Lingshen Anyu Hotel has given me enough confidence in this aspect. Both the rooms and the public areas are kept clean and tidy and equipped with first-class facilities. Before check-in, the hotel staff will thoroughly clean and disinfect, which makes me feel relieved and comfortable.
In addition to good hygiene, Lingsense Anyu Hotel provides excellent service. From before my stay, the hotel staff provided me with a series of thoughtful and small services. They helped me buy ferry tickets, provided the simplest route to the store, and patiently answered my questions about tourist attractions. Their friendliness and professionalism made me feel right at home.
For me, staying at Lingsense Anyu Hotel is as warm and comfortable as coming home. Here, I can not only enjoy the beautiful scenery and unique architectural style, but also feel the unique cultural a**osphere exuded by the hotel. At night, when I step into the warm lights lit up in the space, I feel an immensely peaceful bliss.
Overall, Sensation Anyu is an intoxicating sanctuary where one can immerse themselves in the wonderful natural scenery and unique island culture. Whether traveling or relaxing vacation, here can bring me a perfect experience. I strongly recommend it as the first choice of accommodation for your trip to Xiamen, and I believe you will also be attracted by its charm.

msg:If you have never been to Gulangyu Island, please read it carefully and don‚Äôt fall into the ‚Äúaccommodation‚Äù trap.
1. After arriving at the port after a 5-minute boat ride, I didn‚Äôt have a car, so I carried my luggage and drove the navigation system. It was all in alleys, and there was no one to pick me up. The navigation always deviated, and I had to take detours for half an hour to get there.
2. But you have to praise it. The quality of this hotel is comparable to "Hanting, Home Inn, Seven Days" and so on. The breakfast is also as shown in the picture. What you see is everything.
3. Environment: I have to say that this hotel has put a lot of effort into promoting it. It has a majestic and gorgeous appearance, but in reality it is just a run-down building that was decorated with 5 cents of special effects lighting.
4. Facilities: Very complete. Toiletries include toothpaste, toothbrush, razor, and even two types of slippers, one disposable and one plastic sandals.
5. Hygiene: I couldn‚Äôt even find the words to retort about this. I panicked when I saw the material of the bedding. Sure enough, the pillow was burnt and yellow. When I opened the quilt, I saw two bloody and dirty lumps. The color was very light and the edges were clear. I hope they have been washed. Yes, it should have not been washed off (I hope).
6. Service: Full marks for attitude, average experience. Because there is nothing, so except for the good attitude (anyone can persevere when they see a big enemy), I don‚Äôt feel any service.
7. I don‚Äôt know what Ctrip thinks. The hotel labels I searched were based on ‚Äúfive-star luxury‚Äù. The first one I recommended was this one. The price tag was 1,000 to several hundred yuan, and the actual payment was 976 yuan.
8. The only hotel on the island with a shuttle service has a minimum price of just over 600, so the cost is not very high. The price of this hotel made my big head triple in size.
9. I hope you can come to Gulangyu and get closer to the "Listening" and "Listening Feeling" series of hotels. After all, I would be too lonely if I was the wronged person.
10. To summarize: sky-high price Hanting
