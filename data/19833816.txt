msg:Environment: The location is so beautiful, it has contracted an entire hilltop, with beautiful mountains and clear waters, and the air is refreshing. Listening to the white noise of birdsong, taking a nap can sweep away the fatigue of the workday.

Facilities: The breakfast is very rich. The noodle stall has soup noodles, scallion oil noodles, small wontons, as well as handmade tofu pudding, freshly made roujiamo and seafood porridge, and there are many varieties of fruits. The Chinese restaurant tastes very good, with moderate saltiness and high prices, but there are set meals on the official account that are cost-effective. I recommend crispy bamboo chicken, abalone rice, fish head soup, and small fish in the shelter. The restaurant environment is great. The afternoon tea on the ninth floor is worth checking in, with a panoramic view. The hotel has a special indoor baby club, and adults can also play basketball, game consoles, archery, horseback riding, KTV, and Ba Duan Jin. Parent-child activities participated in tea picking on the tea mountain outside the hotel. If you have the opportunity, you can experience tea picking and tea frying. I feel that staying for a week for recuperation is no problem.
There is also a popular new rural area nearby, which is planned by the Shanghai Jiaotong University Design Institute as a whole. You can stroll around if you have time.

Service: I am most grateful to the housekeeper Yolanda, who is very considerate. She helped us arrange the itinerary before we checked in, provided travel tips, and asked us about the fruit we chose in the room every day. She also contacted us in time to help us send back the things we left in the room with our baby. The uncle at the concierge was also very kind and friendly. In short, it was a very comfortable hotel to eat and stay in.

The hotel is in the mountains. The overall Chinese-style decoration is elegant and grand. The room facilities are very good, the area is large, and the open balcony has a panoramic view of the beautiful scenery. The bed is more than two meters long, and the children can roll around at night. The round bathtub, the children lay in it for half a day without water. In addition, there are free drinks in the refrigerator, which is great.
The service is also great. After checking in, the waiter helps to take the luggage and lead the guests back to the room. After that, there is a one-to-one service from the butler, who introduces all the facilities and services of the hotel in detail, as well as the surrounding activities. Thanks to the butler Winnie for providing us with thoughtful and considerate service.
In addition, the photo service provided by the hotel, Qidu Travel Photography, is also very good. It provides a variety of Chinese costumes. The whole process is enthusiastic and patient, there is no hidden consumption, and the photos are taken very well, leaving a beautiful record of the trip.

Among the large circle of luxury hotels I have stayed in, the housekeeper service of Cherry in Banyan Tree Anji is the best, no one else.
The surrounding attractions went to Lingfeng Temple, Dazhuhai and Yu Village, all of which are very good, especially Lingfeng Temple and Yu Village, one is an ancient temple in an empty mountain, and the other is a rural and wild interest, both are worth recommending.

In addition, I have to praise the hotel's breakfast, which is very complete and of good quality. In particular, when the chef of the Chinese breakfast stall learned that there was no omelette I wanted, he took the initiative to make it for me separately. Great.

After arriving, the receptionist and housekeeper Linda enthusiastically introduced the parent-child facilities of Banyan Tree and upgraded the room type. Because it was the wedding anniversary of my parents-in-law, housekeeper Linda also arranged the room decoration and sent a cake. The next day after leaving the hotel, housekeeper Linda contacted me to ask if I had left a piece of jewelry. It was not until then that my wife discovered that the bracelet was missing üòÇ It was a very pleasant trip. The only small regret was that the infinity pool was not open yet, but the indoor pool was also great and the children loved it.

Let's talk about the advantages first 1. The check-in experience and environment are great. After all, it's a hotel that I've been wanting to stay in for a long time and finally realized it 2. The courtyard villa is really worth recommending. The hot spring plus the independent courtyard, coupled with the mountain view and bird songs, is definitely a good place to relax your mind 3. Essential oils are also a major feature of the hotel. I personally like the body lotion, but unfortunately I didn't buy it in the store 4. It is equipped with Tesla slow charging piles, which must be praised
Let's talk about the disadvantages 1. The turndown service did not give a doll gift. I accidentally looked through the order the next day and found that the turndown service was given as a gift, so I asked the housekeeper for it 2. I found a cockroach in the shower room the next day. This is understandable. After all, there are flowers and plants in the courtyard, so it's inevitable 3. There are too few Tesla slow charging piles. I personally feel that there should be 4
The Chinese restaurant and breakfast are all satisfactory

msg:Staying at Banyan Tree Hotel was a very memorable trip. You can feel its unique tranquility and harmony in the hotel. The hotel design cleverly combines traditional and modern elements to create a warm and elegant a**osphere.

I was deeply impressed by the hospitality and meticulous service of the hotel. Before I set off, I was contacted by the exclusive butler Yolanda. The detailed arrangements made me feel the attentiveness of the exclusive service. She also specially picked me up in the lobby, making me feel at home.

The hotel provides a rich variety of breakfasts, fresh ingredients and wonderful taste. Dinner offers a variety of Anji specialties, each dish is carefully prepared, and the color, fragrance and taste are delicious.

Banyan Tree Hotel provides a high-quality accommodation experience, allowing us to have a perfect relaxation experience after intense work. Looking forward to staying again in the future.

The housekeeper service was very thoughtful, but there were two big flies flying around the roomüòìMaybe it was because the villa was surrounded by grass and trees, there were a lot of mosquitoes outside, the hot spring pool in the courtyard was just for viewing, the facilities and hygiene in the room were OK, the breakfast was average, the hotel restaurant was too expensive and I didn't try it, there was a Whale Valley next to it that the children liked very much, the overall experience was OK

The resort hotel doesn't even have a heated outdoor swimming pool, and there are no fun activities. Many of them are closed, and the room charge of 2,000+ is just to stay and eat in the hotel. If you do some bad craftsmanship, one person will pay 98. It tastes ugly and is filled with additives.
The cleaning was average. After cleaning the room, I didn't even leave new bathrobes and slippers. It's really not worthy of the Banyan Tree brand.
When checking out, I asked the concierge to pick up my luggage, but no one came for half an hour. Carry your luggage down by yourself.
It‚Äôs not worth the price. Please consider it carefully. Many items are not available. Please ask the hotel in advance.

msg:I didn't want to write this negative review at first, but my mother fell down in the yard and hasn't recovered for a week now, so she decided to write this negative review.
I booked a parent-child room and a courtyard villa because the parent-child room has a slide suitable for my children and the courtyard villa has a pool suitable for us adults. However, after checking in, I found that the slide in the parent-child room had no safety guarantee at all. The slide was very steep, but there was no buffer zone. The mat underneath was also torn. The child slid down very fast and with great momentum, and fell directly after sliding down.
The swimming pool in the courtyard villa still scares me because the dirt on the wall of the pool is very thick and the water is very dirty. I got up immediately within five minutes of going in and then felt itchy all over my body. I scratched it as shown in the third picture.
Then I reported this matter to the hotel. The service was very good and they immediately changed me to a two-bedroom villa. The price is slightly higher than the price of my two rooms. At that time, I thought the hotel's service was pretty good.
But after checking in that night, I found that the air conditioning was not turned on in the rooms and the villa was very cold. I asked my housekeeper for a new quilt. Forget it all.
Because the hotel said there was a free photo shoot, I made an appoin**ent to come to the room for a photo shoot. I made an appoin**ent at 11 o'clock the next day, but the person arrived 20 minutes late. Once we arrived, the shooting was very fast. After 10 minutes of shooting and 10 minutes of film selection, I asked for a few more pictures and paid 400 yuan. That's okay, because there is no free lunch. But when I received the photos, I got angry. After I received the money, I should have done some processing. The original photos were sent to me, and I am not an excellent photographer. One photo comes out every second. I can really shoot for an hour outside at 400 yuan. . Forget it.
The yard of the villa is quite big, but there are really many potholes... What I can't bear is that my 63-year-old mother fell into a pothole in the yard and broke her hand. She has not recovered yet.
This was my first trip of the new year, but I didn't expect it to be so miserable. I hope the hotel can pay attention to its reputation and reputation and improve these shortcomings.

There are many activities in the hotel. You can sing, listen to music, take a walk, take a bath... Have a drink in the lobby bar in the evening. The two singers have good singing skills and the a**osphere is very good.
My favorite thing is horseback riding and getting to know the "Snow Dragon", which is the biggest gain from this trip. Under the current pressure of public opinion, I still hope that everyone can continue to love protecting animals, so start with yourself.
Finally, I am very grateful to Luna from the front office. She was the best housekeeper this time. She gave me a very cute turn-down gift and a blind box doll. She also arranged the itinerary for the past few days in an orderly manner. Thank you again!

I not only enjoyed the misty rain of the Banyan Tree's white walls and black tiles, but also the green mountains and green waters. The most important thing is the butler.

She also gave me a anniversary cake and helped with the upgrade. It was very considerate! Thank you to the male manager of the Chinese restaurant for giving the children the steamed eggs. The Chinese restaurant tastes really great. Thank you also to the traveling photographer Allen for his service. The photos were great! This is the hotel worth staying at again. In my mind, it is the best hotel in Anji.

The hotel is elegantly decorated and well-equipped, and you can see the careful care of the hotel staff in every corner. What impressed me most was the warm reception from Carla at the front desk when I checked in. After that, she served as the housekeeper for this stay and helped me order meals, event reminders, checkout and other services. She was very professional and made my food and accommodation very convenient. There is an archery activity in the hotel. I would like to thank the young man in the activity area on the first floor who held an umbrella with me on a rainy day and accompanied me to the archery venue. He also taught me how to shoot a bow and archery, and I learned a new skill. I tried the hotel's Shangfang Restaurant for breakfast, Longitude and Latitude afternoon tea, and Baiyun Chinese Restaurant. Overall, they were all delicious. Overall, it was a very pleasant stay!

At the entrance of the hotel at night, I met my little brother (a thin man wearing glasses) who drove the guests off, and he took the initiative to ask if he needed a car ? , We replied: Thank you, no need. After he drove away, it started to rain heavily. Unexpectedly, he turned around and came back to pick us up, saying that he was afraid of getting caught in the rain and catching a cold. This kind of warm service was very touching; when we checked in, he sent us off The little brother who came to the room introduced the situation of the hotel and the facilities of the room very carefully and meticulously; the waiters were warm and polite everywhere he went, and he felt at home; he would come again to experience it if he had the opportunity.

msg:Room: If you like it, it's simple, if you don't like it, it's simple. As soon as I walked in, I felt like an upgraded version of the guest house. The facilities are standard 20 years ago. There is a coffee machine on the bar at the entrance, but there are no coffee capsules, just for decoration. The size of the room is small, and the bathroom is the smallest and most low-key among the five-star brands I have stayed in. The balcony is quite big, but it's useless in such a hot day. The first round of minibar is Coke Sprite + a can of miscellaneous beer.

Public hardware: The lobby is okay, it feels like a boutique homestay. The aisles are a bit old, some are dirty, and the carpet is wet and dry and looks dirty. The elevator doors don't seem to be clean. The children's playground is too small, and the toys together are not enough for a small kindergarten classroom, and all of them are old objects. The restaurant is ok.

Environment: It has the usual mountain view of Anji Hotel, but it is all man-made. Although it is on the mountain, it does not feel like a mountain. It is just a piece of good artificial green land. Much worse than those in Moganshan. The mountain is not small but there is nothing to go to. The area belonging to the hotel is very small, and it takes more than ten minutes to walk around slowly. There are several classical garden-style corridors close to the doors of the rooms in the villa area. It is a good view. I don‚Äôt know if it is two hundred meters together. The highlight is the outdoor swimming pool, which is really big and has a good view, but it also looks very old, and it ends at 6:30 in the evening, unlike most resort hotels that end at 10:00. In summer, you can swim from 5 pm, unless you are very sun-resistant. Walking out of the hotel area is a regular artificial mountain road, with developer landscapes on both sides, a few minutes walk to Jingqi Valley, a small children's playground, five or six facilities, half of which are broken, and it looks like it has fallen into disrepair not long ago. The greenery is good, and a high-quality community park Bar.

Service: The old man at the door is very enthusiastic, and the butler Luna is also very honest. When encountering the staff, he greets warmly and meditates alone. There is no one to guide the parking and charging, and it took a long time to get it done. Half an hour later, the security guard said that he couldn't handle it. It's not common for guests, and then he couldn't handle it for a long time, and finally I figured it out by myself. Luna sent an extra bed and a children's breakfast for this, thank you very much! After entering the breakfast room for two consecutive days, I was chased to the dining table and asked to pay for the children's meal. Fortunately, Luna helped me and finally waived it. Thank you! In the swimming pool changing room, if you want a towel, you can only hide at the door and shout. Generally speaking, the service quality is uneven, occasionally five-star and sometimes farmhouse, it depends on luck.

Breakfast restaurant: It is not bad in a 1,000-yuan five-star restaurant. The restaurant is not big, and the dishes are not many. The quality is Huiyuan + Mengniu level. There was no milk next to the grains, and the bowl was small enough to hold a spoonful of grains. When he saw a chef in black and white hat, he asked. He pointed to the distance and said that the milk was over there. So I suggested that they put the cereal milk closer like other houses, and the person replied coldly, thank you, and didn't look back. No one in the restaurant asked about coffee and black tea during the whole process, and no one collected the tableware before 8:30, and it also depends on the waiter's mood afterwards. The waiter stood by the wall like a pile, not knowing what to do. The overall level of farmhouse music.

In an episode, I booked two rooms. On the second day, I found out that a little turtle was given away in one room, but not in the other room. Luna added a gift, which was later found to be included in the price. I feel that other housekeepers are the icing on the cake, and this place is used to make up for the pitfalls. In all fairness, Luna is still good, but the hotel cannot rely on one person to create a five-star hotel. I hope the overall operation level can be improved.

I saw some travelers arriving in groups of more than 1,000 from somewhere, and I felt that this was the price. I was a 4,000-two-night Ctrip package.

msg:First of all, I would like to praise my housekeeper Yolanda for her professional service and high quality. She helped me solve problems and communicated in a timely manner. But such an excellent butler is really weak and has too many bad teammates, especially a male foreman in the Chinese restaurant (not sure) who has a very poor service attitude and quarreled with me. From his various performances, it can be seen that the hotel has various aspects There is a lack of communication between depar**ents and inadequate training. The hotel has a card collection activity. The children participated enthusiastically and completed the activity very well, but they did not get the rewards marked by the activity. This disappointed us. Rather than doing this, it is better not to do it. Won't stay here next time. This is the first time I met a hotel waiter with such poor quality, and he was still a petty boss. This little fat guy‚Äôs attitude disgusts meü§¢.

msg:The hotel environment is very comfortable, the service at the front desk is meticulous, and he can skillfully introduce the places to visit around. He is very friendly to people like us who never do guides. The swimming pool and playground are very suitable for families traveling with babies. They are very nice, and the travel photos sent are not enough Meaning, it is very casual and has no concept of time. When I first made an appoin**ent, I said that I wanted to shoot at the outdoor swimming pool. I asked for ten o‚Äôclock. It's ten o'clock, but it's almost time, and the photographer hasn't contacted me. The customer service called and asked me to wait a while, so I waited. After half an hour, the photographer contacted me and said that the scene at the swimming pool had to be cleared. Other customers would mind. I would like to ask why I didn‚Äôt say it directly when I first made an appoin**ent. My attitude was extremely bad and I was very impatient. I didn‚Äôt know where I offended him. I took more than 20 photos. My family is two children. It only takes a few minutes from the photographer to the scene to shoot the film. I don‚Äôt know what the quality and experience can be. I don‚Äôt know the meaning of the hotel sending this travel photo. It‚Äôs a waste of time. This attitude ruined the whole mood. I said that two children should take a little more photos together. In the end, there were three group photos, and the faces of the two group photos were not complete. When I saw the photos, I was blown up. Let me choose on the camera and say mine. The time is up,...how do I choose, just return to travel photography? It‚Äôs too perfunctory. The doorman is worthy of praise. Whenever he sees us, he is always happy. Thinking about the comparison makes him angry.

I guess they were so busy that I didn‚Äôt see them delivered even after checking out. The overall service was okay. I highly recommend the Chinese restaurant‚Äôs specialty boat fish head. What is very bad is this travel photography session. This service brings down the entire experience. Let‚Äôs talk about the complimentary photography service provided by the hotel. Many hotels now have this, but this experience is very bad. We will follow it when we shoot in Sanya. When you communicate some shooting details, you can feel that you are being served. However, this time we only took a few minutes. We took dozens of photos in a small area for you. We took a look at it directly on the camera and sold you directly. Packing up all the photos, I saw that the photos were almost the same and said there was no need to pack them. In the end, they asked us to choose them on the camera. The camera screen is so small, how can we see the expressions and effects? In the end, we directly asked if we could choose on the computer. He reluctantly took us to get a computer for us to choose. When I saw the photos, I realized why the packages were so cheap. In the end, I didn‚Äôt like any of them, and I couldn‚Äôt choose even the group photos. I didn‚Äôt know that this hotel was recruiting. What is the standard of a photographer? You can‚Äôt sell us so much that you ask us to choose five photos with a face while looking at the camera. He also said that these are free. His attitude is extremely bad. It feels like he owes you. I just look like that. Someone who is greedy for petty gains? On such a hot day, the whole family is spending all their time just for these five free photos of you? What a waste of time and mood... I really don't understand why I have to suffer from your kind of service when it's free. I'd suggest the hotel charge for it, otherwise it always feels too careless and casual.

1. The KTV equipment has problems and is not repaired. There were two large bags. One was said to have not been used for a long time and was not allowed to be seen. The other was let in, but the staff worked on the air conditioning and stereo for half an hour, and finally told him that it could not be used. It seriously affects the vacation arrangements and mood of the residents.
2. The scheduled archery shooting was not allowed. When I placed the order, I made an appoin**ent for archery. I made other arrangements in advance and arrived at the archery range on time. However, I was told that someone else had been arranged and our reservation was invalid.
3. Breakfast has a single variety. I'm really sorry for the Banyan Tree brand. There are few types of breakfast, and the provided milk, hot water, and American coffee are very ordinary. They don't even taste good. Drinks need to be charged separately.
4. Service. Although the turndown service started knocking on the door to ask for late arrival, in the end they didn't come; the breakfast waiter's attitude was almost like no one was there; the service for self-paid afternoon tea on the first floor was also cold.
5. Service awareness is too poor and professionalism is too weak

1. The service is not discounted just because it is a package
2. It has the best environment and service among several Banyan Tree resorts I have stayed in. The Baiyun Restaurant tastes good and the presentation is beautiful.
3 There is turndown service and fruit gift every day. I want to drink with friends at night and ask a Thai restaurant for shrimp chips. I gave a big bag and gave a small gift when I left the hotel.
In short, I will go...

msg:The biggest feeling and impression of this stay is that the hotel service is very good. The housekeeper Yolanda added WeChat in advance to inform some information about hotel meals, activities, etc., and was able to answer some questions I raised in time. She cared about the itinerary on the day of check-in. Make all the preparations in advance, you must praise it.
Due to the smooth communication in the early stage, after learning that I have a broken foot and am inconvenient to move, a wheelchair was prepared for me in advance. Thanks to this wheelchair, it made my mobility much more convenient during my stay.
üçÉThe environment of the hotel is very good, the natural oxygen bar is very quiet, the most enjoyable thing every day is to listen to the sounds of nature and let yourself go, if it is not so expensive, I really want to stay here for a month Take a walk, leave a trace of regret
üçΩÔ∏èBreakfast is relatively rich. I went to the restaurant once for my limited mobility, and then I asked my family to pack it. During the period, I also had afternoon tea at the top floor of the latitude and longitude line. The taste was quite satisfactory, the appearance was more pleasing, and the service was more in place; The restaurant is not serving dinner this time
üë©üèªüíºThe service is really good, whether it's a housekeeper, cleaning or room service, they are basically responsive and polite. There is a special incense every day during the day, and special essential oils will be ordered at night; there are also cute little gifts; a big surprise for my mother on her birthday (welcome to experience it yourself)
üîßThe overall facilities of the hotel are a bit old, and this may be the only thing that I think needs to be improved; in addition, as a luxury hotel, it is still necessary to prepare a few wheelchairs. I borrowed this one from the hotel, and the quality is a bit worrying. Point out when you leave the store.
In short, thanks to Yolanda and other service staff in the hotel for leaving a deep impression on my mother's birthday‚ù§Ô∏è
The remaining regrets will come when I recover ü§£

I like that it integrates the relaxation and comfort endowed by nature into the design of the hotel. This time in Anji, Huzhou, I finally checked in the Banyan Tree Anji that I have been thinking about for a long time. Surrounded by green bamboos, Chinese-style gardens with white walls and black tiles are laid out between mountains and lakes, as if living in a landscape painting.
Banyan Tree Anji has the largest infinity swimming pool in East China. Unfortunately, the temperature is too low and the swimming pool has not been opened yet. I feel regretful and make up my mind to come again in summer. The Longitude and Latitude Bar on the 9th floor of the hotel has a 270-degree view, and the special afternoon tea, looking at the mountain view, is very comfortable.
Thanks to the duty manager Dylan and the housekeeper Vidy for their meticulous care throughout the process

It is very suitable for parents and children, and it is more suitable for couples. The room is not too small. It is nice to have a balcony where you can drink tea and breathe fresh air. It's just that the bed in the twin room is a bit too small, if you can try to choose a big bed room. The quantity and quality of breakfast dishes still have room for improvement for a hotel of this luxury level. The hotel is equipped with a chess and card room, KTV, sap, etc. for leisure and entertainment, but there are too few free items, and some entertainment items can be added appropriately, such as table tennis, billiards, outdoor badminton, etc. Then the telephone service at the front desk and in the guest room is not bad, but it is necessary to strengthen the awareness of actively introducing and providing services, instead of waiting for customers to ask one by one. Speaking of the housekeeper, Parker Yao, I would like to give a lot of praise. First of all, he is very strong. He communicates harmoniously and has a strong sense of service. He added me on WeChat the day before he came here. If you have any questions, you can contact the housekeeper in advance. He will help you bring them in on the day of check-in. The room explained the aromatherapy, minibar, fruit, etc. that the room can provide... During the few days of staying, the housekeeper answered and solved all the big and small problems one by one, which was very worry-free and trouble-free. Xiao Zhu, the photographer of the travel photography, is a good person, both in terms of photo quality and communication. I can take advantage of the travel photography process to go shopping in the hotel. It is also good to take some beautiful photos for souvenirs after leisure. Overall a good experience!

The younger brother is also very enthusiastic. He charges 20 for an extra photo, which is very conscientious. Overall a pleasant outing

It was already past 5 o'clock when I arrived at Banyan Tree Anji from Shanghai by self-driving for 3 hours. Parker, the housekeeper, called me one day in advance to confirm the room and asked about the customization preferences. It was very good. It greatly saved the processing time at the front desk. As a hotel with the theme of recuperation The resort is really looking forward to the finishing touch.
Facilities: I stayed in a lake view villa this time. I thought it would be safe if I came here. The front desk made up the price difference and directly arranged the room type of the lake view villa. The room is very new.
Hygiene: There are no dead ends in the oversized bathtub. No water stains and hairs were found after the inspection. The turndown service is timely and tidy, and the wooden floor is free of mold, etc.
Environment: The private courtyard üè° is very nice, and the small pavilion is very suitable for playing chess, playing cards and drinking tea üçµIt will be a bit cold in winter, but it is just right in summerüòéThe resort has the feeling of Zhen Huan's harem. The bamboo forest and mountain scenery complement each other, like a paradiseüéã
Service: I would like to praise the butler Parker again. As the hotel's recuperation ambassador, he took the initiative to introduce the hotel's facilities, and issued a recuperation passport to lead the check-in. Travel photography, catering and other arrangements are in placeüëå
Catering: Baiyun ‚òÅÔ∏è Chinese restaurant tastes good, fried small fish and braised pork taste very good! Praise the service of sister door, add water in time, and ask about preferences.
Overall, it was a very good recuperation experience. I drank white tea, enjoyed the beautiful scenery, soaked in private soup, and experienced the hotel's special butler service. Next time I go to Anji, I will choose Banyan Tree Anji.
[ Peaceful and auspicious, the breath of the banyan tree is wonderful for recuperation ]

After staying for one day, I deeply felt that the villa area is really much quieter than the general rooms in the main building. Love love love! In addition, every night, there is a bed-making ceremony and a small gift, which is so thoughtful, and there are small surprises every day.

In terms of catering, the Chinese restaurant has a great decoration style, which is elegant and tasteful. The taste of the dishes is excellent, and the local specialties are a must. Shang Restaurant Thai food tastes very authentic, ate for 2 nights, especially the Bak Kut Teh and Phnom Penh Noodles! Blow up the chef! excellent! The breakfast is also good, there are many choices, I ate Vietnamese noodles for 4 days hahahaha üòÑ.

In short, the Banyan Tree Anji is one of the best in China! Stay again next time!

msg:very bad! I have traveled to so many places for so many years, but I have never written a review. This is the first time I am so angry and come here to write a bad review!
Last week, I booked a garden villa room for two nights at Banyan Tree Anji. On the morning of the third day, due to the hotel‚Äôs arrangement problems (water coming out of the pool caused slippery floors + there were no handrails on the steps in the room), my wife stepped on the ground, He fell hard to the ground, his arm was bleeding from the fall, and his tailbone was also very painful.
We did a simple trea**ent in the hotel, put a band-aid on the arm, and then returned to Hangzhou. Then my wife became more and more painful along the way, and couldn't sit still. When I arrived in Hangzhou, I found a large bruise on the tailbone.
We went to the hospital for an examination that night, and it showed that the coccyx was injured and dislocated, and we had to stay in bed for three days.
When this happened, I went to the hotel to ask for compensation. I fell in your room and was injured because of your responsibility. It is very risky to design such a ladder without handrails and place it next to the pool.
The hotel also admitted that it was their mistake and expressed their willingness to take responsibility.
The matter ended here, so I proposed 5,000 yuan in compensation, which is not much at all. I spent more than 5,000 yuan a day at their place during my stay at the hotel.
Then the hotel‚Äôs show operation came. I don‚Äôt know if such a big hotel has never seen money or something. The housekeeper who communicated with me first asked the leader for instructions, held various meetings during the period, and later asked me to provide various medical records. After providing them, they even said that they need insurance, and then asked me to mail the original medical records, copies of ID cards, and a lot of invoices to them for evaluation? ?
Then I asked her how long it would take to deal with it, and the reply was one month, and how much she could pay, and the reply was that she didn't know.
I was speechless at the time. I was injured in your hotel. You didn‚Äôt want to compensate the customer as soon as possible and deal with this matter. Instead, you started all kinds of show operations, trying to pull me into your endless wrangling. In the process of communicating with me, I kept implying that the hotel was "helping me" to solve the problem with the insurance company. The co-authorship of the hotel has no responsibility at all. I fell and injured in your store, and it became a dispute between me and the insurance company?
To be honest, I have been to so many high-end places to eat and stay, and I have encountered similar things occasionally before, but every time they deal with it for me in the first time, whether it is free room fee or loss of money, it is very Quickly and completely consider for customers!
And this so-called high-end Banyan Tree, the room rate of several thousand yuan a night, in your place, a meal is more than one thousand, and I fell and injured here. Wasted more of my time, really opened my eyes!
Afterwards, I approached Ctrip to intervene. After hearing our experience, Ctrip also expressed support for the hotel to compensate us first. They communicated with the hotel and refunded us the room fee for one or two nights. After a few days of communication, the hotel refused unexpectedly up.
Later, Ctrip said that they would pay me 1,200 yuan. I also understand that Ctrip is doing its best. It is quite speechless to meet such a hotel management. The so-called "insurance compensation" I am too lazy to go to the hotel to argue. A fall is bad enough, don't let them ask for materials for a long time, and the insurance will say that you will pay hundreds of dollars for medical expenses (because the doctor said that the tailbone can only heal by itself, no matter how serious it is, there is no way to treat it, So the medical expenses are not much, but the pain is real) Let‚Äôs pass it up, that‚Äôs doubly frustrating, my time is not wasted like this for you guys.
That‚Äôs all the experience. I didn‚Äôt add any embellishments, nor did I take it out of context. There is no need, and there is no need. A hotel that focuses on high-end, after a guest has an accident, can make such a show. Banyan Tree Resort family.
Maybe the hotel management thinks that their actions are in line with the so-called rules. After all, if something goes wrong, it‚Äôs insurance. How much time and energy you waste in the middle, and how much you can pay in the end, is the insurance that has the final say. Anyway, we didn‚Äôt say no pay.
To this, I can only say hehe, staying in your hotel for two nights cost tens of thousands of yuan, and when I fell down, the hotel has a face of "following the rules" and can't even afford 5,000 yuan. It's a waste of time. time!
Whoever likes to stay in this kind of hotel can live in it. I will definitely not stay in Banyan Tree again. There are so many high-end hotels, and the service is better than yours. Please also friends who read this comment, in Think carefully before checking in. If it were you, you would have spent tens of thousands of dollars out to play. In their hotel, because their safety measures were not in place, you fell down, and your good mood was ruined. , You can‚Äôt pay out even 5,000 yuan. It will waste more time and energy for you to go to insurance, and you may not be able to pay much when it‚Äôs over, which will make you feel worse. Is a hotel with such an attitude worth your experience?

Service: Butler service is also a feature of Banyan Tree. This time, butler Alice's service is also very professional. Although there is a problem with the maintenance of the hotel room, the final communication is still satisfactory.
Lobby bar: Except for Monday, there will be a resident singer at 19:45 every day, which is very good. Banyan Tree was another scene in the evening. Coupled with the professional performance of the two singers, there were not many people, but they were still very focused, which drove the a**osphere of the scene. Remember to check in when you stay at the hotel.

Before the epidemic, I watched the boss live broadcast and stocked up 8 (in order to meet various times, I found out that I only need to make up the difference ~ but now I think it is so worth it, because I have to come again!)
To accompany my girlfriends to relax, the whole hotel style is what I love, it has both Southeast Asian style and classical charm, which is great! Above picture above!
And my favorite housekeeping service (since Rui* has fallen in love with the housekeeper), this time, Xiao Qiao is in charge of me, such a lovely girl~ She is caring and professional, and she gave a lot of tips. I think I'm too troublesome (I'm a little bit furry, hahaha)
Not much to say, I just want to use up all the pre-order coupons I bought! Hang down all other Internet celebrity homestays and hotels! (It's not an exaggeration, because I went to see another resort in the middle...)
ps. The Chinese restaurant in the hotel is very good. I even ate rice~lobby bar. You can also try hand-made shrimp cakes, authentic Southeast Asian taste~The breakfast has raw pickled, this is really a big love! ! ! The evening fragrance and the good night ceremony are so sweet~ Oops, it's a bit incoherent, look at the picture~ Hahaha

I finally chose to stay at this hotel on the day of my birthday. The feeling of staying is really It is very beautiful, especially the water pavilion that surprised me when I first entered the hotel. When I looked up at the sky, the clouds were light and the wind was light; After entering the room, the housekeeper Yolanda who served us gave us a surprise. In the room full of Jiangnan style, he brought us a sweet afternoon tea dessert and fruit. The scenery of the hotel is very good, clean and quiet. Comfortable and perfect for a relaxing getaway!

This is the filming location of Ang Lee's "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon." On the night of check-in, I was pleasantly surprised to receive a phone call from the hotel manager Joe, which is rare in other hotels. The management of Banyan Tree Hotel is good at listening to the feedback of the hotel guests, which helps to improve and improve the service concept and quality of the hotel. Such management style is commendable.

Thanks to the housekeeper Alice for her care and service throughout the whole process. Even if there is no room for the twin bed, help us to coordinate in time and still continue to stay at the double bed Banyan Tree The elegant and comfortable hotel eliminates the fatigue and anxiety caused by the tiredness of the boat and the crying of the baby What I came to were all the small gardens with mottled bamboo shadows. The few bamboos are specially designed. The landscape of the pool is also just right. But it happened to let you sit in the bubble pool and look like a picture of living in the Fuchun Mountains, burn the incense provided by the hotel, drink the tea provided by the hotel, and listen to the cicadas and birds. This kind of elegance is not an ordinary five-star hotel. The service of the imitated hotel is even more in place. Every service staff is polite and almost responsive to the guests. Although it is not enthusiastic, it is polite and thoughtful. I think it is just right. I am too busy with my baby. The room forgot to take pictures. The villa is well designed and comfortable. Just the ordinary five-star standard room but the meticulous balcony of Banyan Tree is equipped with anti-mosquito screens, aromatherapy and capsule coffee. There is also a children's playground. Although it is not clean enough, it is enough to discharge the baby. It is recommended that the hotel strengthen parent-child activities, although it is listed. Children's club activities but we did not see any activities for children when we went. If the price is not so cold, I would like to experience the pool villa next time

Everything reveals the comfort and speciality of this trip. It is surrounded by mountains and rivers, surrounded by smog and white bricks and blue tiles. It is really the best choice for vacation and leisure. It's a pity that the time is limited, and I look forward to coming again next time.

       The staff of the hotel are also very enthusiastic, and the call of the battery car is also responded in time and will take the initiative to say hello halfway. If there is any problem during the stay, whether it is the front desk or the housekeeper Xiao Qiao, we can help solve it in time.
        The hotel's infinity pool is also very beautiful, but unfortunately it was not launched this time. Be sure to try a few laps next time. The afternoon tea on the 9th floor of the main building is also very good and worth trying. The layout and facilities of the room are also very good, and the hot spring pool in the garden can also soak in the tiredness after playing. At night, you can soak in the open-air pool and count the stars, and wake up in the morning and lie in bed to greet the sun and watch the scenery.

But there is still a gap compared to hotels in this price range; especially in terms of hygiene and maintenance, the sofa and carpets are obviously stained, there are traces of mold in the bathroom and air-conditioning outlets, and the floor drains also have obvious odors when it rains. Although the hotel housekeepers and service staff communicated very actively and professionally, and most of the problems were solved through room changes and repairs, the stay experience was greatly reduced; in addition, the hotel's catering standards still need to be improved.

msg:Banyan Trees all over the country have lived in all over the country. As an old-fashioned hotel, in fact, both hardware and software need to be improved. Ten years ago, Banyan Trees were good, but these years have not kept up with the progress of society, especially the whole humanized hotel. The service system cannot rely on the old and sell the old. This time, Banyan Tree Anji took parents and children to stay with them. The villa itself wanted to be more relaxed and comfortable. As a result, when I checked in, there was a room with a large courtyard, but I was given a room without a courtyard, and Not to mention that the pictures and texts do not match, is this the case when you have a room? The housekeeper also asked me in a rhetorical tone, I'm sure which one has a room for you, right? ! As a service staff, I don't even have the most basic qualities. Second: the more important thing is that before I checked in, I found out that I booked more than 10,000 in advance, but now it has become 8,400. I informed Ctrip about this, because I am a Ctrip's black diamond VIP, Ctrip immediately agreed to refund the price difference. During this process, the hotel immediately changed the price because I wanted to refund the difference. Is this the pattern of your group? Sister, I am a black diamond. I live in a hotel for more than 1 million a year. I have never stayed in any service system. You guys still play this kind of small operation. Third, there are mosquitoes in the room, and we are all bitten by bags. , don't say it's the villa because there are mosquitoes, the weather is hot and there is no yard, we didn't even eat at the door, I reported this to the housekeeper yolanda, and there was no concern from the beginning to the end, just because there was a price difference, I reported it to Ctrip Do you have an opinion on me? In the end, it was because I was a black diamond of Ctrip that I dealt with it, okay? When the housekeeper took me to see other room types, I finally did not have any communication. It felt as if I was looking for something. The whole process was extremely uncomfortable. I spent 10,000 yuan per night, so your service and system should be I would like to suggest you learn from a good team, how the managers of Bulgari Shanghai and Aman Fayun deal with it. Fourth: Banyan Tree‚Äôs breakfast should be considered famous, but Banyan Tree Anji is famous for its breakfast. Zhuang Zhen is a giant pit. I rarely eat when I live in so many good hotels. Today I just want to get together with my family. I set an alarm clock in the morning to experience that every Banyan Tree is not integrated with local characteristics. ? But there is nothing, and there are many service staff, all of which are used as decorations there. Anji is not a remote area, there should be no shortage of materials and ingredients, and even the standard of ordinary stars cannot keep up.
I won't talk about the scenery above. It's too unsatisfactory. The so-called Chinese Huizhou architecture is very messy. Today's experience, as long as the housekeeper can handle it intimately and has a good service attitude, I don't think it's the quality that a management should have. As for being so bad, the housekeeper asked me to give a 5-point review. I think you are so embarrassed. In fact, I really want to give you advice, but think about it, don't waste my time. I don't care whether the hotel can see it or not. Jin, a hotel management, in addition to the old brand, now it is the fundamental to adapt to the market and improve service

The rooms in the main building are my favorite feeling of warmth, especially the large corner balcony and invincible view of the lake view suite. Every morning and evening, I go to the balcony to drink tea and blow the breeze, and I dance on the balcony in the evening. I feel full of vacation. The hotel's staff services are also online, from the housekeeper the day before the check-in to the welcome, and even the lifeguards of the swimming pool are very active. In particular, the housekeeper, Alice, communicated with the two-day dinner reservation on WeChat from the day before check-in. On the first day, she arranged snacks and fruits, and on the second day, she also prepared fruits (black notes) very thoughtfully. Helping to book KTV, canceling afternoon tea, etc., they can respond in time, and also help me recommend places suitable for parents and children to play (because I don't want to go rafting). To tell the truth, the competition for hotels outside is fierce now. In addition to hardware, luxury hotels are all about service. The excellent service of the butler system brings guests a sense of attention. Keep it up! I ate two dinners in the hotel, both Thai and Chinese food. I got 80 points. I was too lazy to go to the street to find food. Our family also sang KTV for 1 hour, it was so fun. Finally, I hope Banyan Tree Anji maintains the service level, and I should continue to come.

Just a few words;
- Chinese restaurant: The distance between tables is as close as the Shaxian snack bar on the roadside; the dishes are also very average; only the price is in line with the hotel's positioning;
- Service: Very uncomfortable. The service was supposed to be more comfortable, but it made us even more uncomfortable. The waiter knocked on the door frequently when there was little business. One time, I was on a conference call in the room and did not answer the door. As a result, the waiter kept knocking on the door until I had to suspend the meeting to open the door, thinking it was some emergency. In the end, I just came to give you some fruit? is it necessary? Simply speechless.
- Overall facilities: Both rooms and common areas have signs and smell of mold and are not well maintained.
- Others: The hotel itself is large, and there was no guide or introduction to tell me what activities I could do in the hotel or surrounding areas. I was confused when I checked in, and when I checked out, I was helpless.

msg:First of all, I would like to thank Banyan Tree Anji for bringing me this very good experience. As far as I am concerned, Banyan Tree Anji can be ranked in the top three among the luxury/ultra-luxury hotels I have stayed in. After the order is placed, there will be a staff member in the hotel to inform the housekeeper that the housekeeper will add WeChat in advance, it is worth mentioning mine Butler Zed's service is very high-quality. After wechat, we will inform various specific information of the hotel in the form of pfd, so that guests can have an early understanding of the hotel. If they have any specific requirements for the room, they can also inform the butler. I will try my best to arrange it, and I am pleasantly surprised that my butler Zed has been waiting at the hotel entrance before I arrived at the hotel and escorted me to check in and guide me into the room (this is in obvious contrast to the formal butler service of many hotels) For example, Sanya Ritz XXX stayed for several days without knowing what the parents were like) and after checking in, he also cared about the whole process without disturbing. If you have any needs, just tell Zed that they will be arranged in place, and the service staff of the hotel are also very good. Awesome, basically everything you want within five minutes will be delivered to the room, the hotel's breakfast is also very good, even if there are a lot of guests, they will still guide them to their seats, so that the guests will not be confused in the restaurant and will be served every night. There is a turndown service, and the gifts are relatively small and cute; more importantly, there are essential oils to order in the room, which can help guests sleep better. The attitude of the waiter is also very good, and they will ask if they need strong/light or moderate. Fragrance, and there are many choices of flavors. I also want to make a few small suggestions here: 1. It is recommended that the hotel's hair dryer can be replaced by Dyson's, otherwise it will take up more space if you bring it yourself (I believe many guests have already had this suggestion‚ò∫Ô∏è). 2. The drinks in the mini bar can be properly added with some imported drinks and chocolate. Many ultra-luxury hotels also operate in the same way (the things in the refrigerator of the hotel at this price seem a little cheap). 3. It is recommended that the fruit can be delivered after the guests check in, and can be replaced with sliced fruit, which can have a small and delicate feeling, and can also avoid waste to a certain extent. 4. Because the hotel is a landscape room, it is recommended that the aunt clean the glass properly when cleaning, or at least have a simple cleaning of the floor-to-ceiling glass before guests who have stayed for more than two days in a row. In general : The layout of the hotel, the service of the butler, the enthusiasm of the staff, and the variety of entertainment facilities are the reasons why I would recommend this hotel. I also hope that the hotel can consider my suggestions and provide the guests with a better experience. , I will still choose this hotel when I go to Anji in the future, I recommend üíØüíØüíØ!

msg:Because the Banyan Tree brand chooses to spend the Mid-Autumn Festival, wedding anniversaries, and birthdays here, it is generally okay, the natural environment is quiet, and the hotel facilities are complete. Things, I found that the luxury hotels in the inland area are currently reflected in the price and hardware. A set of soft services has not yet learned the spirit of resort hotels, and the service capabilities need to be improved.
1. I am most dissatisfied with the cleaning of the hotel. After staying for five days, I called for cleaning twice in a row. After returning, I still did not clean it. Later, the housekeeper and the manager apologized and explained many times. I think it is nothing. But every time I cleaned it after that, I always felt that the hygiene and fineness were almost meaningless, and the carelessness of the cleaning aunt could be seen from the details. Either the paper is gone and not put in, or the toilet paper has not been replaced for a few days. Sanitary fineness needs to be standardized for waiters.
2. The second is bad luck this time. Greentown Property is working near the hotel. It is cleaner for me to lie down in my home community than in the hotel. The sound of piling at the construction site starts at 7 am in the morning and stops at 5 or 6 pm. A sense of vacation, chug chuchu. The Mid-Autumn Festival does not stop for a day. The hotel is very considerate and told me many times to upgrade the room, but I don't want to collect luggage. Those who go to the hotel recently will have this trouble. The construction must be completed, and it is estimated that it will be difficult in one year. The hotel itself is very aggrieved by this problem.
3. The overall environment of the hotel is good, the facilities are good, and the housekeeper Xiao Han is also very good, but the sense of room service can be better. We like to order room service at the hotel. There are not many choices for meals. If we want to eat a bowl of shredded pork noodles with snow cabbage, we ask the kitchen that it can‚Äôt be done. I feel that it can be done if the service is in place. Shredded vegetable and pork noodles are still very common, and the materials are all available.
4. Say something good. The hotel's SPA is not bad. Baiyun Chinese Restaurant is very suitable for me. After three days of eating, I have eaten the wall every time. There are not many dishes but every dish is very stable. A comfortable room has How important a restaurant is to eat well for a journey! So because of these two points, I am basically satisfied with this trip. Thanks to the housekeeper, Xiao Han, who is very responsible and caring for us. I even gave me a beautiful birthday cake on my birthday. Thank you Xiao Han and the hotel.

All in all, this trip is quite happy, but there are still some fly in the oin**ent. I hope that I can enjoy the resort hotels and services around Shanghai in the future, so I don‚Äôt need to fly to other places for vacation.

We kept trying to change to a twin room without success. The hotel's gym is open 24 hours a day, and there is also a special yoga room. The yoga mats are all lululemon, which is super agreeable, and there is no interruption of practice when going out. The hotel has a housekeeper for each resident. Our housekeeper's name is Yolanda, who is super caring and can ask any questions.

The site selection of Banyan Tree is very high-level, and everything complements the natural integration of heaven and earth, which is very beautiful! The room facilities, to be honest, are the same as the problems of Banyan Tree Sanya. They seem to be a little old. Looking forward to the upgrade of the hardware facilities! There are old people and small places to travel. I originally booked two independent villas. Xiao Han at the front desk is very professional and enthusiastic. He understands our number and the family birthday trip. It is recommended to increase the price to upgrade to a two-bedroom pool villa. Birthday cake, everything is arranged in an orderly manner, and the overall stay is still very satisfied!

msg:Fans of Banyan Tree will share with you the experience of staying at Banyan Tree Anji

Environment: Banyan Tree has always been proud of its location, and Banyan Tree Anji is no exception. The location is very good. From any angle of the high point, you will not see anything unrelated to the scenery and Huizhou architecture. any building.
On the first day, I stayed at the Quan Yue Suite. This was my first time living in a high-rise building in Banyan Tree apart from Galaxy Macau and Banyan Tree Shanghai on the Bund. It really surprised me. The designer embodies the concept of Banyan Tree to the fullest. Although he lives in a modern room on the 9th floor, there is no sense of incongruity with the Huizhou architecture downstairs.
The next day I stayed at the Vista Villa, which is very Banyan Tree. As the youngest Banyan Tree, the details of the hotel are very well done. The housekeeper communicated the approximate check-in time of the guests in advance and adjusted the hot spring water temperature in the yard in advance.

Service: As a super five-star wild luxury hotel, service is the top priority. I think that most of the sites of wild luxury hotels that are not common are located in the countryside or in the wild with beautiful scenery, far away from the city. This also makes it harder to train and hire hotel staff than hotels in cities. In my opinion, Banyan Tree Anji's training is the best of all Banyan Trees in China. Even though some cleaning aunts and security uncles seem to be hired locally, they are very enthusiastic and meet the super five-star standard. When they encounter guests in the corner, they will take the initiative to turn sideways. All the staff in the hotel will take the initiative to say hello when they meet the guests. For a loyal fan of Banyan Tree, this really gives me the feeling of coming home.
This trip happened to coincide with my lover's birthday, and the housekeeper was also very responsible and patient to communicate with me about the birthday room arrangement in advance.

The design of Banyan Tree Anji also amazed me. The designer used a lot of water mirror elements to set off the beauty of the misty rain in the south of the Yangtze River. Infinity pools are a popular element in many hotels, and even many folk customs have begun to build infinity pools. But I can only say that a master is a master. The location of the infinity pool and the proofreading of every angle cannot be done by everyone.

In general, Banyan Tree Anji can be ranked Top 3 in the heart of my fans who have lived in all Banyan Trees. I hope Banyan Tree Anji will become better and better, and I hope there will be more outdoor activities to set off the beauty of Banyan Tree. Come Enrich your guests.

If you successfully change back to the green code, otherwise you will not be able to go back to Shanghai. Ordered room service at 8pm, burgers, Thai beef salad, Tom Yum soup, all tasted good. The swimming pool is big, the water is clean, the water temperature is very comfortable and warm. Caffrey helped me book the Spa, 2 hours of body relaxation and facial trea**ent. I especially like the body parts and the techniques are special. It's just that time flies too fast. I will look for Caffrey next time I have a chance to visit Banyan Tree.

msg:The package I stocked up before ~ this price is really worth it in the summer. I like the outdoor swimming pool of the hotel very much. Although the water temperature is relatively high in summer, the sunset is particularly beautiful. The elder brother of the lifeguard on the shore often takes out a large floating board, and children can climb up and float on the swimming pool with great joy. In addition to the location and environment of Banyan Tree, the most outstanding thing is the service, which makes me feel at ease with the whole family. Especially the day before departure, the housekeeper Yolanda has explained all the details and my questions one by one, including the location of the hotel's various restaurant facilities and precautions for epidemic prevention. During the period, I also took the initiative to remind me to help me book afternoon tea, rafting and contact travel photography, and also helped me deal with the modification of the reservation due to the weather. I will definitely continue to choose Banyan Tree next time!

I still chose Banyan Tree Anji, which I visited two and a half years ago, because the mountains, waters and buildings basically satisfied all my imagination of leisure and vacation. During the summer vacation, it is indeed a bit noisy when there are more children, but fortunately, it does not affect sitting on the balcony with a chair, a cup of tea, and a book in a daze. The housekeeper, Yolanda, was very enthusiastic, thoughtful and professional, and answered all questions neatly, which made us very satisfied. All in all, my family and I feel that compared to two and a half years ago, Banyan Tree Anji is still better and better.

It is open in the morning and I can't get up haha, it is from 4 to 10 in the evening The clock is enough, the restaurant has come here to experience it
The freshly squeezed juices in the breakfast buffet are good. A bowl of Vietnamese rice noodles cooked on the spot is great~
For dinner, it is recommended to have Thai food, and it is necessary to book in advance ~ because I added WeChat with the housekeeper Yolanda, and helped me make an appoin**ent. Singing by singers, they sing relatively small and fresh songs.
If you are traveling by car, it is recommended to drive to the lotus pond next to it. So beautiful. As far as the eye can see is no exaggeration. There are also different varieties of the whole piece. I recorded a video for everyone to see, and the photos are full marks. The unexpected joy of this trip

The bath tub in the room can feel the spectacular landscape view, and provide essential oils and singing bowls, which is very relaxing. The hotel's outdoor swimming pool is great, and you can rent an electric surfboard, which is very fun, and the children have a lot of fun. The hotel's catering is also done very carefully. Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy the SPA this time. Butler Alice's service is very good. From the moment of booking, she provided warm and thoughtful service throughout the whole process.

msg:Located among green waters and green mountains, the hardware facilities and hotel decoration follow the usual elegance of Banyan Tree. The light green tone in the room and the layout of bamboo elements are unique, which not only conforms to the local characteristics, but also gives guests a fresh and comfortable a**osphere. However, in the humid climate in the south of the Yangtze River, the walls of the room still have mottled water stains. Bluetooth speakers can be borrowed from the front desk, which is more user-friendly. It would be better if the TV can cast the screen.
In terms of food, the breakfast is rich, there are Chinese, Western and Japanese choices, as well as freshly made Vietnamese rice noodles. The overall taste is not bad. Baiyun has always been Banyan Tree's Chinese food master, and I still remember the pork ribs with black plum sauce in Banyan Tree, Yunnan, which is very memorable and misses me. But this time I was traveling alone, so I didn't choose a meal. I tried Bak Kut Teh in a Thai restaurant, and it was satisfactory.
insufficient:
Although the whole garden is in the same Banyan tree style, it may be due to the limited space for display, the overall layout is a bit cramped, the modern style of the main guest room building is abrupt, the vegetation in the garden is a bit crowded, and there is a lack of rules and regulations, which is not only inferior to Banyan Tree Yunnan, Compared with the originally small Xixi Banyan Tree, it also lacks sincerity. A walk and stay in the garden is rarely surprising and somewhat boring.
The only teas provided in the room are Pu'er and Jasmine. I thought, shouldn't the guests have a taste of such a famous local white tea?
During the stay, maybe it was a marketing activity of a well-known car brand. A prototype car was parked at the gate, and the brand logo was erected on the hydrophilic platform in the lobby. Decreases a lot.
In terms of service, the overall is acceptable, but when I asked about the SPA reservation when I checked in, the staff didn't know the situation. The staff of the lounge are also low-headed people who keep their mobile phones inseparable; the hall guards are often unattended, and these details will still deduct points.
This hotel is quite suitable for parents and children, with a large infinity swimming pool and a children's play area. However, the sound insulation could be better, a bit noisy.
Complain about the room service, there are only five or six kinds of dishes to choose from, and the drinks are basically one kind of beer and one kind of red wine. The unidentified staff who sounded like an intern said that the Terrace Lounge will get off work at five o'clock...
The concept and service awareness still need to be improved.

Although I was frightened by a small accident, when I walked into Banyan Tree, the beautiful environment and humanities gave me a heart. The touch is still very beautiful.
During the epidemic, the hotel has allowed guests to fully enjoy the in-house facilities. We not only watched the movie "******* Mouse and Worm", but also enjoyed KTV, afternoon tea, and finally filming for our trip. We enjoyed each project, and the three days and two nights ended quickly.

I recommend upgrading the villa, which is much more comfortable and spacious than the ordinary room. It turned out that because it is a twin room, I also helped the children with extra beds. You can also sleep more comfortably, and also give a lot of service guides and help make an appoin**ent to take photos of Hanfu. The butler service is great and five-star praise.
Breakfast: It is quite rich in the morning. The best thing is the fried buns, which are sold out every day.
5 exclusive travel photos: The first time I experienced Hanfu travel photography, it was a good experience. In addition, a lot of photos were added. The only downside is that there are not many clothing options, no makeup and hair are provided, and the body is Hanfu on the head. is a modern hairstyle.
The first round of MINIBAR: There are beverages and beers, but they are all drinkable. I really can't drink it in winter. It is recommended to price hard goods such as chocolate snickers.

üîîService: In addition to the five-star butler service, the room service is also in place. There is fruit on the first day and sweet-scented osmanthus cake every afternoon. The temple fair-themed activities were specially launched for the Chinese New Year, and they are quite rich. I like it. In addition, the game area and entertainment content provided for children are also very rich. Basically, in the hotel, in addition to going out for skiing, you can play in the hotel.

The hardware aspect is also fully compliant.
The butler service is very considerate. The docking Jack has communicated the itinerary and check-in needs in advance before departure, and is always on call.
There is still room for improvement in hotel services and supporting facilities.
Looking forward to traveling again next time.

The first time to book a luxury hotel, compared to the price of Banyan Tree Nanjing
The price of Banyan Tree Anji is starting to be more pleasant (work hard to move bricks before going to other Banyan Trees to check in)
It is a health room facing the lake view specially decided
Wake up to the mountains and lakes every morning
I really feel very happy
The bath tub in the room is also big
There are also welcome foods for the incense and singing bowl yoga mats
Doing yoga in front of nature is the most enjoyable thing
The hotel also has a tour guide dedicated to health care projects
Indoor events like fat loss lessons, swimming lessons, yoga lessons are free
Outdoor projects like digging winter bamboo shoots and tea are charged separately
200 winter bamboo shoots per person can take 1.5 bamboo shoots
Whether you dig or not to dig to see luck, it depends on the technology, but in the end it will be filled.
We have to say that 800 six kilograms of bamboo shoots for the four of us is still a bit expensive
The hotel can process at night, equivalent to 800 plates of fried bamboo shoots
hmmmm is very expensive, but it is estimated to be once a year
Just go to a natural place in Shanghai to kill the script
The sanitation service is very good, the waiter will greet you cordially when you see it in the corridor, as if you have been living here
Gives people a sense of being at home
The breakfast is rich enough to make me think whether it is going to open until lunch
Not only the ordinary Chinese and Western breakfast, but also the crab, chicken, etc. I only see dishes at noon, which surprised me a bit (though I don‚Äôt eat much)
The chicken in the Chinese restaurant is actually average, but the fish head soup (preferably not spicy) is really refreshing, and there is no surprise in other dishes.
Moreover, the Chinese restaurant is estimated to not entertain many people at ordinary times, and I feel that there is not enough staff before the kitchen is full.
But I have to say that his freshly squeezed orange juice is really superb. I am usually afraid that anyone who does not drink orange juice can drink it again. The sweetness and sourness are just right.
But the lack of stereo in the room makes me feel that it is inadequate. Fortunately, I brought my own stereo, but the presence of HBO etc. foreign TV stations in the TV is also a surprise to me, but my friend said that many hotels of the same level are like this (after all, I It‚Äôs the first time to go to such an expensive one)
I almost forgot to say that the welcome gift is Yohji Yamamoto‚Äôs casual wear perfume, and there can also be a charity donation plan to help the local sustainable development, about 7 yuan a night, the hotel will also add the same The cost of this one is actually quite like it. After signing the confirmation donation letter, there is a solid little turtle as a gift, very cute
I don‚Äôt know if I have a chance to spend a lot of money to enjoy it this year
Anyway, this experience is love
There is also a bar on the 9th floor of the hotel, but it closes at 9:30
So I didn't have a chance to see
The package I bought has a travel photography service, and the time is too rushed to make it.
Leave some regrets, but it's worth going around or taking pictures near the hotel
I like the Chinese architecture very much, and I also recommend everyone to go to "Push Shi" to eat vegetarian dishes.
The lady boss is very nice and is willing to share her diet philosophy with you

The butler service of the btw hotel is a bit tasteless, and replying to messages is relatively slow

msg:When I first arrived at Banyan Tree Anji, I felt like I was in the outdoor Taoyuan. This time I took my children to play for three days. The following are my views on Banyan Tree Anji for reference only.
Live: We live in a lake-view room. If you want to sleep in and set an alarm clock, you can see the misty and rainy lake at around 8 o'clock in the morning in winter. If you want to get close to the lake, you can only live in a villa, because the entire Banyan Tree has not been able to reach the river.

Eat: We have eaten in the hotel for a few days. The hotel has a Chinese food and a Thai food. I am also a diners. The two tastes are quite delicious but the price is a bit expensive. If you want to be more cost-effective, just drive out to eat. The breakfast is also very rich. For breakfast, it is recommended to make Tom Yum Goong soup in the morning. The afternoon tea dessert cakes in Banyan Tree's "Long and Weft" are very common. There are too many gelatine ingredients in it. The chocolate on the top is also a substitute for cocoa butter. I did not give it to children, but the salty desserts are still quite delicious.

Service: Butler service, as long as you and the butler‚Äôs problems can basically be solved. I would like to thank our housekeeper Xiao Qiao for hosting. SPA Banyan Tree Anji special fire, we must make an appoin**ent in advance, we can't make an appoin**ent on the same day, we can only make an appoin**ent for noon the next day, you must make an appoin**ent in advance if you want to go to the spa.

I saw Banyan Tree the night before and found this hotel suitable for vacation, so I decided to come to Anji. This time we were received by Charlotte. We had already contacted and arranged the room before coming to Anji. The service at Banyan Tree was good. Checking in to the hotel was also very fast. The housekeeping staff took us to the lake view we booked this time. When I opened the door, I was attracted by the large balcony. It is said that this is the largest balcony in the entire Banyan Tree. The scenery is very good, next time you come to Anji, Banyan Tree is still the first choice!

Special thanks to Xiao Qiao, the housekeeper, for his enthusiastic service from before check-in to check-out. Because many people checked in around 15:30 in the afternoon on National Day, Xiao Qiao also arranged for the hotel to present fruits and desserts. In the afternoon, the hotel has handmade biscuits for children. After making the hotel grill, send it to the room. In the evening, there are carnival activities on the hotel lawn. From 19:30 to 21:00, adults can eat barbecue and drink beer. The bedding is good and comfortable to sleep. Friends who are staying at Banyan Tree for the first time, especially those traveling with children, it is recommended to have a good time in Taohuayuan. There are many attractions in Anji, but to be honest, it feels more watery, especially the Great Bamboo Sea in China, so I took a photo. Tiger Hidden Dragon has become a hot tourist destination. I was very disappointed when I arrived. It is better to play in the hotel Taohuayuan, which is also a supporting facility made by Greentown. It is about 200 meters from the hotel, slides, ant holes, swings, suspension bridges, sand piles, and lakes. The scene may not be fully open yet and cannot be played. In short, the hotel is more fun than the surrounding scenic spots.

msg:I have always thought that Anji is good at homestays, and there are rare high-end large-scale resort hotels. Until this time, I stayed in "Banyan Tree"-it turns out that there is such a "paradise", quiet and elegant, quiet and refined.
    For my ignorance, it is said that this room has opened in 2018 and has 151 rooms, including 30 villas (including 4 two-bedroom units with small swimming pools), and the rest are standard rooms in the main building. The architectural design style of the entire Hui-style building + Suzhou gardens is antique and unique: the villa area is run through with wooden corridors, winding long and staggered; the main building has the imposing manner of the palace courtyard, the cornices are warped, the air is magnificent, and the interior layout is extremely feng shui. Pay attention to it, especially when standing on the porch overlooking the open-air swimming pool, it can be described as "a horse and river", and the momentum is like a rainbow [strong].
    We lived in a one-bedroom villa, and felt and sighed about the spaciousness of the space [Âº∫]: There is a small courtyard in the front and a garden in the back. There is a square pavilion for 4 people and a semi-outdoor double "hot spring" in the garden. Pool (non-ground water, with surf massage, I really like its hidden design); the bathroom actually occupies a quarter of the indoor area, luxuriously equipped with a circular bathtub with a diameter of about two meters; the bedroom has a large bed around it , There is also a Go table on the long couch where the window is leaning...Of course, what I like the most is the strong Japanese style in the room: a neat, tall wooden beam structure roof; a large number of wooden decorations including ring lights. Surface application; bamboo-patterned wall and sliding door decoration; hemp screen window cloth and extremely hemp and extremely light roller blinds; simple and retro chandeliers, table lamps...quiet and warm, giving people a homely feeling [joy]
    There are at least three highlights: one is the double combination of a large outdoor infinity pool + a large indoor pool, which ensures that people who like to swim and splash can fully enjoy the pleasure brought by the water. What's more, the large outdoor swimming pool itself has one left and one right. The resources and environment of the two paddling pools are so good that they are "a mess" [Âº∫]; the second is that the "Banyan Tree" SPA is also well-deserved. The atmosphere of the room is quite good, the space is very large, the music is soft, the surrounding is quiet, and there is a roof that simulates the starry sky, which makes people calm and relaxed. The technicians are professional and respect the feelings of the guests, so I enjoy it all over again; thirdly, there is a "Kemi" museum and a "Kemi" vending machine. There are also a large number of "Kemi" for sale in the Banyan Tree Pavilion. , Really surprised us. We didn't expect that this place would be a "Komi" focus [color], so I bought a lot of [Breaking tears for laughs], adults and children like itüíï.
    A few impressions: The Chinese restaurant "Baiyun" is okay, breakfast is very average, Anji‚Äôs famous local noodles are not good, the pan-fried buns are not good, and the Thai dishes for dinner are not good. It is better to change to authentic western food. ; After all, the opening time is short, the greenery has not yet grown, and there are few big trees. The bamboo that Anji is proud of is still in the cultivating stage. There are many ****s in the backyard of the villa. Lawn; service is generally good, although sometimes no one answers the front desk phone. I want to give a special praise to the swimming pool lifeguard [Qiang]: Very responsible, as long as there is someone in the water, he will return to his post. I swam by myself for more than an hour, and the lifeguard has been there looking at me, and I don‚Äôt play on my mobile phone, thank you for the guard [ÂêàÂçÅ]
    In short, Anji's "Banyan Tree" is an exquisite place away from the hustle and bustle, suitable for home and retreat. Under the epidemic situation, you can temporarily forget where you are without flying to a foreign country, enjoy the relaxation of the body and mind brought by the free and gentle time, and absolutely cure all diseases [naughty]üëç

Banyan Tree Huangshan is near Hongcun, Banyan Tree Lijiang is in Shuhe Ancient Town, and Banyan Tree Anji is in a peach blossom field, with bamboo forests, reservoirs and lush green hills, suitable for vacationing. Let‚Äôs talk about the room: the maintenance twin room, the eighth floor has a very wide view, facing the reservoir, there are yoga mats and other sports equipment, the room is quite large, the decoration is a bit old, and the corners and corners are generally sanitary. This point needs to be improved; Speaking of the spa, I experienced the spa with my mother, and it was very good 90 minutes and very comfortable. The elderly have a soft press to choose; I have no experience in catering for dinner, breakfast is acceptable, the variety is rich and local characteristics, the coffee is not bad; talk about the service The butler will contact you in advance to ask about some of the room requirements and introduce the special items. Home away from home, the focus is like the pool brother, the name is not asked to wear glasses, on Friday, August 27th, very nice to the children, patience and patience to teach swimming interaction, enthusiasm The state of loving work is particularly moving. I didn‚Äôt see this little brother when I went to the pool on 28-29. I regret that I hope the hotel can reuse this employee. In short, it‚Äôs a good experience to travel, and the elderly and children are happy!

The only thing I feel warm and has a good attitude is that in the very small parent-child room, there is a lady named X Xuexue who is really attentive and very good. Overall two nights stayed in a good environment. There are not many types of breakfast, it's relatively simple. In short, the price is not directly proportional to the service.

The hardware of the room was quite satisfactory, because the impression of the previous Banyan Tree Villas in Macau was so good that we were a little disappointed with this room. But the software service is still great. I would like to thank the front desk housekeeper Chloe for his caring service.

üçÉEnvironment:
Entering the room, the field of vision is super wide, and the ink-and-wash-like scene comes into view, which is truly breathtaking. We were basically soaking in the room for two days and couldn't bear to go. The scenery was so good. The cribs in the hotel are very cute and I like it.

The hotel‚Äôs Chinese restaurant is a major feature. The boat head fish and small trash fish are delicious. We ate twice in a row and never forget. The fried rice with soy sauce is also great value, so I pack it home decisively on the day of leaving. The restaurant is expensive but really good.

In short, it was an unforgettable and pleasant journey, thanks to Alice for her kind service. Come again in autumn.

msg:Coming to Anji was decided temporarily. A few days ago, there was a typhoon and rain. After returning from Naked Fort of Mogan Mountain, I wanted to visit Anji. Banyan Tree was the first choice. It proved that I didn't choose the wrong one afterwards.
 As a resort hotel, Banyan Tree is indeed an iconic presence in Anji. The Hui-style architecture, partial to the Chinese and elegant decoration style, opens the vacation mode of Taoyuan military village in one second. Hotel service is the highlight of the whole brand concept [Happy]. Baby backpacks, dolls, passes, and small t-shirts were sent at the front desk when checking in. The feeling of parenthood came out [Like]. Both Chinese restaurant and western restaurant have tried. Among them, the western restaurant dinner is Thai style, which is indeed an improved taste, suitable for Jiangnan people who are not too spicy. The background music üéµ are all Thai songs, it is estimated that they are the theme songs in Thai dramas, they are very nice. After the meal, a fruit plate was also given. Here you have to manually praise the service brother, insert the name: Huang Chengru, brother [ThumbsUp][ThumbsUp]
 Breakfast was nothing but fuss, but the pan-fried buns are especially delicious. In the evening, there is a band in the bar. The latitude on the 9th floor is very large, similar to a clean bar, with open-air seats. It is a plus if you engage in team building. Overlooking the hotel room on the left and the night bonfire in the entrance lobby, unfortunately it closes at 9 o'clock. However, you can move to the lobby bar on the 2nd floor, which is more fashionable than the 9th floor, suitable for young people [Cat]. In the evening, I ordered the aromatherapy and soaked in a SPA.
 The outdoor infinity swimming pool must be mentioned. Looking at the mountains, blue sky, white clouds, clear water and green mountains, no matter how gorgeous the words are, it‚Äôs not as good to experience it in person [Cheers][Cheers] In addition, after six o‚Äôclock, the mermaids can go to the indoor swimming pool and continue to float [Afraid] and parent-children In general, the club and the crafting tree house making courses can be enjoyed by a family of three. Before leaving, the young lady at the front desk was so enthusiastic that she sent a small aromatherapy and fresh vegetables ü•¨? Hahaha, the first time I received the vegetables from the hotel, it was really "fresh", the weather was just right, the scenery was pleasant, and Anji after the typhoon passed, a piece of tea.

msg:The hotel management is as good as always! But I didn't expect that Banyan Tree Hotel will also take into account the needs of large consumer groups, setting up large areas of high-floor rooms, and the renovation and expansion of Banyan Tree Tengchong may also be based on this consideration. The hotel‚Äôs catering is satisfactory, with strong choices. The distance between the high, middle and low groups of residents is reasonable to ensure their privacy. Miss Li Bin at the front desk service is enthusiastic, meticulous and professional.

Arriving in the room, the comfort is very good, the privacy is very good, and the air conditioning is cool enough. The yard is also very clean, the greenery is also very beautiful, there are basically no mosquitoes. Thank you Wang Jin from the housekeeping depar**ent for helping to print the homework very enthusiastically. The concierge Xiao Qiao and Xiao Li were also very enthusiastic and gave the hotel green vegetables grown by themselves. The spa experience is also good, very suitable for couples. The Chinese restaurant in the hotel is also good, the dishes taste good, the service is also very good, and it is worth the service charge.

Special thanks to the housekeeper Jack, Xiao Li at the front desk, and Master Ye at the swimming pool. They are all very nice. The only drawback is that it coincides with the peak season of the hotel, the room turnover is very slow, it is inconvenient to change rooms, and the breakfast buffet is all family-friendly, which is very noisy. Next time, pick a weekend in the off-season to play.

Yuerongzhuang is a brand. The service has nothing to say. The environment is also good. The commercial street developed at the entrance is a bit deserted. There are not many choices for meals. In addition, the lake view room is not interesting. The price is not high. Can see the lake is not called. It's called Xiaoxi. The balcony sliding door needs to be improved. Everything else is pretty good. It is worth staying.

The environment of the hotel is nothing to say, the green coverage is very large, the natural oxygen bar, the balcony of the room is lush and lush as far as the eyes can be seen. I especially like to drink Anji white tea on the large balcony and enjoy the scenery. The breakfast is also very rich, with special features.
Special thanks to Bin, who received us very warmly, knowing that we will bring the baby and will help us pay attention to the children's meals, and also sent a small doll when checking in, the baby liked it very much.
Next time I go to Anji, I will definitely go to Banyan Tree!

The quality of hotels in the Greentown depar**ent is not bad. The biggest highlight of Banyan Tree Anji is the 38-meter infinity pool.
It rained on the two days of the Dragon Boat Festival holiday, and swimming in the open air is closest to nature, just like feeling free and relaxing in a natural reservoir.
Especially for the hotel's coach Leo Ye, hand-like praise üëçüèª üëçüèª üëçüèª Coach Ye is a teacher from the Hangzhou Swimming Association. He is good at communication and will guide swimming guests, improve swimming styles, and popularize swimming knowledge. His service attitude is very good, enthusiastic, attentive, patient, attentive, caring, five-star caring service, making guests feel at home. The vegetable garden in the manor has also been taken care of by him. Every morning, parents come to visit the garden and have a good mood. This interesting corner has become the most unique scenery of Banyan Tree. Banyan Tree is because of him. The service makes our family want to experience it again! This time I am really happy to have a happy Dragon Boat Festival holiday with my family at Banyan Tree Anji.
