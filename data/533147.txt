I explained what happened and the hotel booked me to the Executive floor of 33 and I stayed in the most perfect place. I then extended my time as I got my air-conditioning and a first class place to stay to erase my negative feelings I had about the hotel.

The thoughts and service I got was a winner. I gave a 4 instead of a 5 on Cleanliness because I saw big black hairs on top of the back of the bathtub.

To get a 5 you have to have no hairs of other people. Otherwise, I'll stay there again when I come back.

Disadvantages: The facilities are too bad. There is no socket at the bedside of the second twin room. It feels like it was remodeled from another room. It is very inconvenient. The main switch is not at the bedside. The shower couldn't switch the water from the fixed shower head to the removable one, which was terrible. The soundproofing of the room was not good, and the conversation next door could be heard clearly. In addition, the cleaning of the guest rooms is a bit unstandardized. The detergent in the shower room is added three times a day but the old ones are not taken away. The toothbrush for brushing teeth is sometimes taken away and sometimes not.

In addition, for parking, you need to tell the front desk every time you go out. This is not a big disadvantage, but I feel that the mode is a bit backward. It is equivalent to taking the elevator twice every time you go out, and you cannot go directly to the parking garage.

msg:It was a great pleasure to stay at Ascott Raffles City Chengdu! In order to watch the first mixed team table tennis World Cup in Chengdu, I chose this nearest hotel. In the early stage, because the itinerary was not confirmed, I placed the order three times and booked different room types. After communicating with the hotel, we finally changed to a double room. The manager in charge on the day of check-in was also very responsible and showed me the rooms of different room types. Finally, we chose the executive king room on the 33rd floor! Very quiet, clean, apar**ent-style room is very suitable for friends who like to cook and eat by themselves! Although I was worried about the old decoration of the hotel before checking in, it was much better than I expected! Thanks again to the young lady who hosted me, but unfortunately I didn‚Äôt remember her name! If given the chance, next year‚Äôs mixed group will choose to stay here again!

I stayed for two nights. The first night was more than half the price. I was upgraded to a room and the location was very quiet. After checking out, I booked the same room type for another day. This time I was given a room directly opposite the elevator entrance, a triple room. , there happened to be a competition in those days, and the room next to me was noisy until three or four in the morning. The subway was being built downstairs. I was woken up before eight in the morning, and I almost collapsed! Black for life!

The front desk quickly checked in. When I checked in, I wanted to buy a drink so I paid attention to the vending machine. A man and a woman Taking over the machine, due to improper operation and suspected of being drunk, the girl kicked the robot twice hard and made a loud noise. One of them, who was sitting in front of them at the front desk, did not deal with it and even chatted with them with a smile. What kind of quality is this? The room given this time was in a very bad condition and lacked maintenance. In fact, I didn't pay attention to these details originally, but the overall feeling was not good, so the reaction was increased. The door of the refrigerator was also broken. The sound of the air conditioner was loud. Looking at the picture, you can see how scary it is behind the bed, and there are old carpets. I bought takeout for breakfast the next day, but no robot came up for a long time. I went down to check the situation. The takeout was placed in front of the front desk and I asked. The front desk at that location asked why it was not placed on the robot. The reply was that she was very busy and had no time, as if it didn't matter. When checking out, I saw a takeaway guy working hard to deliver the takeout. He enthusiastically took the initiative to put it on the robot, but he I don‚Äôt know how to operate it. The same front desk just yelled at the delivery boy. I looked down on the person who scolded the delivery boy for his hard work. I was really speechless towards some of the service staff in this hotel where I have been staying for a long time. Of course, there are many enthusiastic ones. We cannot completely deny each other, but please respect the hard-working robots, the hard-working delivery boys, respect your own work, and pay more attention to the customers. It was really not a pleasant stay this time! This is my feedback. One or two shortcomings will not make people disappointed, but successive shortcomings will make people despair, making many advantages invisible and shortcomings visible.

The attitude of the service staff is also very perfunctory. The air conditioner is simply perfunctory, saying that the indoor temperature needs to absorb external sunlight to heat up, which is extremely ridiculous!

I originally planned to stay for two days to have a look, but I decided to continue living after two days. Secondly, the hotel and Raffles City are in the same building. It is very convenient for shopping, eating and walking with children. I especially like the outdoor platform on the second floor of Raffles City. It is very comfortable to eat and drink outside. I will choose here again when I come to Chengdu next time.

The first floor of the hotel is connected to Raffles City shopping mall. There is Hema fresh food in the shopping mall, which is very convenient.
Room: For Ascott Platinum members, the front desk directly upgraded the room to the first level. Although it is a corner suite, it is spacious and has a refrigerator, microwave and washing machine. The hotel is old and the room facilities are a bit old, but they are well maintained. The bathroom shower has a lot of water. The soundproofing is very good and there was no noise during our 4-night stay.
Breakfast: All the basics are available, hot pasta, Western-style bacon and omelette salad, Chinese-style pasta, juice, milk, coffee, and fruits. It's not luxurious, but it's not bad either.
Service: No one offered to help with luggage. The restaurant and front desk services are very good, and they take the initiative to say hello.
Others: There is a subway downstairs and the road is fenced, but you can take a taxi to the main entrance of the hotel. The windows in the room are sealed and cannot be opened, and the air conditioner is a bit noisy, but everything else is fine.

It can be delivered to your door when you order takeaway, it is a cute robot delivery~

Although the hotel apar**ent is great, one thing is that the bed is a bit soft. Due to personal reasons, it is not suitable for sleeping on a soft bed. I wake up with back pain every morning. It is recommended that the apar**ent be equipped with a harder mattress for guests to choose.

Overall, it is worth recommending!

In a place very close to the sky, eat a cloud breakfast...
It is my favorite flavor. There are sun eggs, non-spicy hot food, and natto. It is a very happy thing to have your favorite breakfast every morning. And every night before going to bed, there is something to look forward to...

msg:I bought a two-night stay package. The location of the hotel is okay. It takes about 10 minutes to walk to Yulin Road and the subway station. The hotel room is also relatively large. The only thing I have to complain about is the hygiene problem that many customers have reported. I checked in on the first night At that time, there was still a hair on the hand towel, and there was a bunch of hair in the shower room. After going out that night, I found a mask and bamboo sticks under the sofa. I coordinated and changed the room that night. The front desk was still very efficient and professional in dealing with problems. After moving to a new house, I found that the shower is equipped with two conditioners and no shampoo~~ Generally speaking, the price/performance ratio is OK, but the hygiene and cleaning staff training needs to be strengthened.

msg:Environment: Next to the Raffles City shopping mall, there is a large open-air leisure plaza. There is a supermarket downstairs. It is very convenient to buy things. It is really blissful to be able to eat hot pot downstairs.
Hygiene: The room is large, but the hygiene is very clean. It is equipped with a small kitchen. It is safe to use the knives and forks without water stains.
Service: The little girl at the front desk who checks in is very welcoming, the breakfast is very good, both Chinese and Western styles are taken care of, and the dishes are added in a timely manner. There are too many people everywhere during the Spring Festival, and maybe we came at the wrong time, and it feels crowded. No more, but the young man in the restaurant is very enthusiastic to help arrange the seats, and he also thoughtfully prepared small tableware and egg rolls for the baby. I must give a big thumbs up to so many people for their careful service without panic.
Facilities: Maybe the only bad thing is that the road is under construction at the entrance. When we left, the taxi driver searched for a long time and didn't know the location, so he had to go to the side of the road to take a taxi with big bags and small bags.
Overall very good, will choose next time.

msg:All rooms can be smoked, so people who are sensitive to smoke should not come to this hotel to avoid being kicked out of the hotel by the duty manager Chen at four in the morning like me.
Some rooms and facilities are newly renovated. Because the doors and windows are closed, the pungent smell will blow to each room along the central air-conditioning duct. If you are sensitive to the smell of decoration, don‚Äôt stay here, because the hotel will use the name ‚ÄúOnly you propose‚Äù Yin and Yang You, force you to unsubscribe. Anyway, the hotel treats you with the attitude that you can't live. Whether you are pregnant, mother, or single woman, you will be asked to check out in the middle of the night "for your health" and sit in the lobby waiting to go to another hotel the next day.
And those drunk men looking for girls in the lobby will appear around you from time to time, after all, this is an online celebrity hotel.
You were woken up by the strange-smelling gas from the central air-conditioning from time to time, and your lungs hurt. You went to see a doctor. Don‚Äôt you feel the smell?‚Äù and so on. No matter how much you explain, no matter how much you ask to seal the air conditioner, they won't listen, and they won't help you solve any problems. They just tell you to leave with a cold smile.
By the way, let me finally talk about what is a sensitive constitution. For this hotel, people who do not smoke are considered sensitive constitutions. The majority of female compatriots stay cautiously.

msg:Ascott Raffles City is the one that I think is the most suitable for our family among several downtown hotels in this trip to Chengdu. We arrived at the store around one o'clock. The front desk upgraded us to an executive suite. When we walked into the room, it felt a little old, but it was jaw-droppingly large. It was room 1223. To the extent that I don't think it's necessary, there are three halls. There is a washing machine and dryer in the room. I am very happy. I took out the dirty clothes that I had saved a few days ago, washed and dried them comfortably, and solved the problem of the whole family. I also carefully looked at the inner wall of the washing machine and dryer, which were very clean, indicating that the customer service was clean. The kitchen is full of surprises. Pots and pans are readily available. What you want is full of sincerity. Unlike the InterContinental Executive Apar**ents, they are all empty when they are opened. Although we don't cook, it must be convenient to cook. The two rooms are also very comfortable, and the bathroom is large and clean. The only time I took a bath during my trip was in the bathtub in Ascott. I couldn't get enough of the bathtubs in other hotels. The fruit delivered is sincere and the price is reasonable. Great for family travel. very satisfied. The only thing is that Raffles is repairing the subway. Otherwise, it would be more convenient to have the subway entrance at the door. This time we had to take a taxi. Breakfast is simple but has everything you need.

Those who brought children applied for check-out at 3 pm. The front desk also helped to print the children's homework, thank you very much
The swimming pool is very warm and the kids go for a swim every day. Ascott never disappoints me!

The room layout and furnishings are also old, but they are still well maintained. The price of 500 and 600 will be more suitable. I set it at 900 for the summer peak, and I think it is a bit unfair. The breakfast is ok, quite satisfactory, but The attitude of the old aunt at the omelette stall needs improvement. I asked her for a meringue, and she said she couldn't do it! What if I made a meringue for you! A little fierce and a little unreasonable....

1. The location of the hotel is very good. If there is no traffic jam, it is about half an hour away from Chengdu East Railway Station and Shuangliu Airport. Raffles City is downstairs and it is very convenient to eat and drink.
2. The front desk upgraded the room type when checking in, and the basic facilities of the room are OK (pictured)
3. The cleaning aunt cleaned up in time, just met when I checked in, and led the way by the way, very polite

But a few points are hard to say:
1. I live in Beijing for a long time. I traveled to Sichuan and Chongqing a week ago. The epidemic has suddenly spread in recent days. Since I have been to Beijing within 14 days but have not been to high-risk areas, an asterisk appears behind Beijing on the itinerary card. I checked in at 9 o‚Äôclock on the night of my stay. On the high-speed rail to Chengdu, they took the initiative to call the hotel to ask if they could check in. Then, when Chengdu did not announce any policies, the hotel said that it must have a nucleic acid test certificate within 48 hours to check in. After asking other colleagues in the same industry, others The hotel can be checked in normally, just provide the health treasure and the green code of the itinerary card. The second time you call the front desk, the other party agrees to check in. The hotel you have booked needs to be contacted many times before you can move in.
2. The hotel air conditioner is very noisy. I was woken up by the noise of the air conditioner for two consecutive nights, and the earplugs don‚Äôt work. The phone at the reception desk basically couldn‚Äôt get through when I checked in. When I checked out, I gave feedback to the front desk and responded "Now the air conditioner is a bit noisy." There is no more.
3. Attach a photo of the hotel bath towels, like home bath towels.

msg:After staying for three days, the hotel upgraded the room free of charge. The suites have a large space and complete kitchen and bathroom facilities, just like the style of Ascott, clean and tidy. The breakfast was quite satisfactory, personally think it was good. There is a shopping mall downstairs, which is very convenient. As a loyal user of Ascott, I think Chengdu's Ascott is very good, and I will choose to stay in the future. Another: SOS button, scan code Tucao and floor attendant expressly stated that these points are more thoughtful than Ascott in other places, like one!

From children's toys to children's bubble balls in the bathtub, to the children's pool and children's playground, children have fun. And the super cute Xiaoya robot

The environment is average (not convenient to buy small items) and the facilities are relatively outdated (sitting on the side of the bed, the other side will cock up and abnormal noise) and there is no slippers in the room...but the service attitude is not bad

msg:Very satisfied. It is 0 distance from the shopping mall, there is a few words next to the elevator, and the lobby channel is directly connected to the shopping mall. It takes a few steps to the first floor of the mall. It is a pity that the subway channel of the shopping mall is closed due to the subway construction, but you can reach the subway entrance by walking about tens of meters on the ground. Yanji went out again is a big platform for the shopping mall, it is good to take a walk. The swimming pool and restaurant are on the top two floors, overlooking the province.
„ÄêFamily Theme Room„Äë
The rooms are well-equipped and there are many small rooms (a children's room, a storage room and two bathrooms). The furniture is a little bit old but there is no smell. The kitchen facilities are also very complete, except for the lack of condiments, other things like pots, pans, chopsticks, knives and forks. Another nice thing is that there are two small bags of washing powder.

msg:The location is convenient, Raffles City is downstairs, and the subway station is right next to it. The hardware is complete, even the kitchen knives are Zwilling. The front desk brother I met when I checked in was very good.
However, the management of the hotel has a lot of flaws. The cleaning lady went into the room to clean without my consent when I was sleeping. The room card was removed afterwards. I reacted with the front desk and didn't apologize, saying "just go back." After waiting for half an hour, I finally returned the card. As a result, when I went out after a while, I found that this card could not open the door. Go to the front desk, the front desk said "this is an electric card". The whole process was speechless, and such good hardware made the garbage service downgrade.
The swimming pool is small, like a bathhouse.

The sanitary condition is not bad and parking is convenient. Raffles City is downstairs. The breakfast is average, the variety is small, and the taste is average. As a fan of Ascott, this Ascott will never choose to stay again.

It is very comfortable and it is very convenient to arrange two rooms next to each other. It is very suitable for a family to live in. The location of the hotel is convenient, leading to the Raffles City shopping mall, which is convenient for eating and shopping. We also booked Yasige Hotel Apar**ent for the return trip. The fly in the oin**ent is that the hotel's breakfast options are not many, and the food is not so delicious.

  The transportation of the hotel üè® is very convenient, there is a subway station üöâ at the door, which is Line 1 and Line 3, except that the subway üöä is under construction at the door, which has a little impact on travel.

  The hotel üè® can directly go to the shopping mall üè¨Raffles, basic food and drink can be satisfied, there is Hema Xiansheng downstairs, you can buy simple ingredients and go back to the room to cook for yourselfüç≥.

  The shopping mall üè¨ here is a pet-friendly shopping mall üè¨. There are many dogs üê∂ coming to play on the terrace of the shopping mall üè¨ at night. Those who like pets and dogs can consider it, which is quite stress-relieving.

msg:The higher floor of the superior room is quite good. Although the view is basically blocked by the Raffles City Building, it is still relatively quiet. The room smells a bit damp, but the sanitation is very good. I like it.
The serviced apar**ent is directly behind the building, and the road outside is being repaired, and many cars are unwilling to come in. As a result, they have to walk around the entire Raffles City building from the outside main road all the way in for a few days. It's usually fine, but it's really desperate when dragging luggage.
