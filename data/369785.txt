Somehow the water was down on Friday night at 21-00 for 3-4 hours , after 3 calls reception finally answered and said they don’t know why many rooms doesn’t have water. Also suggest to review movie list, half of them are not displayed anymore, or play just 6min and then off; lack of English movies and new releases.

msg:As a regular guest at sofitel I continue to have good things to say about sofitel! The room was clean and fresh, electrical appliances in working condition and the water pressure was at reasonable standard. Under this booking I also had midnight snack and breakfast included. Although staff did forget to deliver my midnight snack. Annie at reception was very helpful, friendly and professional. She gifted me with a salted duck gift and a small sofitel branded perfume on check out! 

Furthermore as a member at sofitels fitness center and swimming pool (as somebody who swims everyday here)I was slightly annoyed with the amount of people in the swimming pool. There are 2 designated sections one larger area for free play and another for those who wish you exercise undisturbed. But today there were children everywhere and the life guard didn't seem to mind that kids were disrupting these clearly set up guidelines. After waiting around an hour for things to calm down I decided to complain to her but she just agreed that it was wrong and did nothing about it... After waiting another half an hour my friend managed to have a swim. I hope more effort is put into training staff around managing people within their designated areas.

Had a problem with a room that smelled like cigarrette smoke, despite being a non-smoking floor, but the front desk staff quickly changed rooms for me offering an upgrade, which was unnecessary but very nice of them.
The superior room which I booked was large and very well appointed; the room I stayed after the upgrade was enormous - a one bedroom, two and half baths apartment basically with a separate office space and living room. Sofitel´s bed. linens and pillows are the best in the business and in Nanjing it was no different. The shower was also excellent, with a powerful rain shower. I was just surprised there were very few western choices for breakfast, but considerning more than 98% of their clients are Chinese, I can understant.
I recommend the Sofitel Nanjing and will definitely be back.

They asked me to fill in a temporary residence form, which is not needed when you already have an address in China, this is the only hotel who asked me to fill this out in my 4 years stay here, then they told me there is no room available as they are still cleaning, I arrived almost  3pm, regular check out is 12, they have ample of time to clean the rooms, I asked how long should I wait but they ignored my question and I was standing there for a good 30mins. The room has a funny smell, the carpet is dirty, it needs vacuuming please, if you are reading this, use vacuum for carpets not a broom. Check out is another story, and the refund for the deposit should be given straight away when you check out or maybe within 30mins but not 5 hours after you are out of the hotel. I will never book this hotel again.

msg:I am a bit disappointed with the service.

1) At the check-in, I was asked to fill out a temporary residence registration form, including private information about my work and activities in China. It is usually the document foreigners must fill out when they move to a new residence in China, but not at the hotel. It never happened in 7 years that I have lived in China.
When I asked the reason for filling out the document, I just got that it was the regulation...even though it is the only hotel where I was asked such a thing.
If it is a new regulation from today, I am ok to fill in, but we should be informed in advance of these requirements and not at the check-in.

2) The second issue is that services like indoor bars and lounges were closed, and we didn't get any reason for it when asking. The TRIP information about the hotel states that we should have access to these facilities. So either TRIP didn't update the hotel information, or the hotel didn't communicate about it.

We had our 1 year old daughter she a lot of toys and coloring toys. We went in town and came back to our room and Lady called Grace took care of our room and packed everything for us and left a note and tea amazing. We requested a baby bed and it came immediately.

msg:The negative reviews are precisely correct.  I implore you to look elsewhere if you want a relaxing holiday (we made it through one night then went to the Kempinski and regretted not going there in the first place!).  

Pros:
- Very competent check-in staff

Cons:
- Deary me, the management either has no maintenance funds or are terrible at their job 
- There is no privacy in the bathroom nor an extraction fan 
- It is run down, broken/stained etc
- My husband is not fussy yet he demanded we stay elsewhere (that’s how bad it was)
- It is cheap but not worth it
- It is nowhere near the Sofitel standard and seems more like a very old franchise that is no longer a Sofitel? 
- Getting a refund was like pulling my teeth out
- The owner and senior management should be ashamed of claiming this as a Sofitel hotel and five-stars - it clearly is not

It was so bad we didn’t take pictures - just look at the other bad reviews.

The hotel rooms are spacious and bright, the mattress is moderately soft and hard, the bedding is skin-friendly and breathable, the water pressure on the upper floors is strong enough, and the shower is very refreshing! Because the corridors are carpeted, the sound insulation effect is also good!
The afternoon tea meals provided by the hotel are also very delicious, which is a small base for dinner and very crisp. In particular, I have to seriously praise Melody MM in the executive lounge for her very enthusiastic attitude, which makes me feel very friendly. It is like a spring breeze to communicate with her!
In addition: The hotel has recently launched a Jinling special supper package: 1. Osmanthus red bean Yuanxiao: not sweet or greasy, moderate temperature, smooth and refreshing; 2. Jinling pastries: low sugar and slightly fragrant, cotton but not sticky, delicate and subtle; 3. Jinling vegetarian biscuits: crispy and spicy, the entrance is very amazing. Although it is a star hotel, it completely restores the fireworks atmosphere of the streets and alleys!
Again: The first round of mini bar is also enjoyable, and you can taste some soft drinks and beer after work!
Must come again next time!

msg:The service is really great! Super! Invincible! Good! (Very loud) It was my first time staying at Sofitel, and it exceeded my expectations. I didn't expect that a five-star hotel with less than 500 per night could have such considerate service. Every service staff I met, from the front desk to the cleaning lady, would greet the guests warmly, and their affinity was max. I would like to especially thank the super cute housekeeper Melody, who is always on call and responsive. It can be said that any high-star hotel/homestay that I have stayed in before that boasts service is not as good as the service experience I got at Sofitel this time.

The location of the hotel is also good. It is on the east side of Gulou District, and Xuanwu Lake can be reached within half an hour on foot. The guest rooms are high-rise and quiet in the bustling city. Although the facilities are obviously aging because of the years of opening, the bedding is still very comfortable, and I slept very well at night. The breakfast is rich, with many categories to choose from. Welcome fruit will be given when you check in, and there will be midnight snacks. Sugar taro seedlings, plum cakes and sesame cakes are all very delicious.

Overall, if you come to Nanjing for business or tourism, it is the most cost-effective choice, no one else. Will come again next time.

I booked the executive floor, and the front desk upgraded me to a larger room for free. At night, I also sent a set of local specialties for midnight snacks. The floor is relatively high, and you can see the Nanjing skyline. 

Because it has been open for a long time, the facilities are indeed old. For example, the water in the shower room is not smooth, and the safe in the room is broken. Later, the floor waiter replaced it. 

However, the staff from the front desk to the guest room, the executive lounge and the fitness center are very enthusiastic and proactive, which makes up for the lack of facilities to a certain extent. In particular, Comrade Iris, who is responsible for checking in at the front desk, took the initiative to add guests on WeChat to help arrange meal delivery and other matters. Her serious and responsible attitude deserves recognition.

msg:It's been a long time since I've had such a bad hotel experience. Since I was traveling with my baby, I specifically requested that the non-smoking room be arranged in the non-smoking floor corridor. There were people smoking every day. It was strange why smokers were arranged in the non-smoking floor. I waited for an hour to get a room on the day of check-in. In fact, the room on the west side was too hot to be checked in. The air conditioner was turned on for several hours and it was still 26℃. You know, it's spring now and it's only 20℃ outside. The room was very hot and the maintenance master came but didn't solve it. The hotel didn't turn on the air conditioner to save money and just circulated the outdoor air. The next day, Nanjing rained heavily and the temperature dropped to 16℃ outside, but our room was still too hot. The next day, the toilet was blocked again because there was no exhaust fan and it smelled bad. I had to wait for the elevator every day to go up and down. There were not enough elevators on more than 40 floors. The only thing that was okay was the breakfast, which was relatively rich. Living on the upper floors was also very quiet at night. This kind of hotel is called a 5-star hotel, but it's actually not as good as a 3-star hotel.

It would be more appropriate to add a sliding door on the outside.

However, there is no hot water in the washbasin, and the toilet is not half full of water, which is not environmentally friendly. In addition, you can hear people coming in and out from the next door and even upstairs. The five-star hotel only provides free supper and drinks in the MINIBAR on the first night. However, it happened to be a rainy day during the Qingming Festival, and the hotel provided love umbrellas for entry and exit, which is very considerate.

There are many restaurants next to it and there is a convenience store opposite. I have lived here since 2007 and still have feelings for it.
 The room is a bit old and the bathroom walls are a bit patchy. But after all, it is a five-star hotel, and the facilities are very good, and it is worthy of the price!
 The public facilities such as the lobby are spacious and stylish. The key services are in place! Allan who was at the front desk was polite and told us things to pay attention to, which made people feel friendly. Thank you for the late night snack set provided by the hotel. It doesn’t have much but is very Nanjing-specific. Humanistic care is a plus!
Let’s talk about the shortcomings. The bathrooms in some rooms are made of transparent glass, which is too transparent! It would be a bit awkward if we weren't a couple.
  Generally speaking, if you choose to stay in the city center, it is quite cost-effective.

I arrived a little late and was actually upgraded to an executive room on the 42nd floor. The area is very large. Big, the bed is also big and comfortable~

Since it was the New Year period, I gave my little friend a small New Year gift, a certain set meal, as well as the first round of mini bar and late night snacks. I overlook the scenery from a high place and enjoy the beautiful scenery of Xuanwu Lake during the day and at night.
Looking at the lights of thousands of houses, it was the right choice for this trip~

However, I still hope that more attention will be paid to small details and hygiene~

msg:I especially want to evaluate this hotel, let me give the conclusion first.
This is a hotel that is a bit old but trying its best to make it better

Suitable for users who are cost-effective and like service
Especially not suitable for users with hardware requirements and details control.

The hotel arranged for an upgrade from a king bed room to a view room with a great view.
The facilities in the house are indeed a bit old, and the elevator is really hard to wait during peak hours. There are also certain problems with the design of the light switches in the room, but these are understandable

Still want to give good reviews
It’s because of the hotel’s service attitude
Pay attention to the attitude. If you really want to say how high-level the service is, no, but every staff member smiles and is very comfortable talking to you.
If you encounter a problem, you will solve it as soon as possible

I particularly like the hotel's swimming pool. It has complete facilities. The key is that the water temperature is very good, not cold at all, and truly constant temperature.

The hotel's hardware is indeed old, but the attentive service deserves praise

The service is worth the price
just because

When I got out of the elevator, I followed the sign and gave me two completely opposite directions (explanation in the video below). How do I ask the guest to choose between the two? The room I booked on Ctrip said the room is 40 square meters. What do I think? This room is not 40 square meters. The picture on Ctrip has a sofa and a bathtub. When I entered the room, they all disappeared. It was completely different from the picture. I suspected that I was downgraded. The third one is the power socket. This is not a problem of the hotel. It is slightly older. Hotels usually have larger plugs that can’t be plugged in, but I don’t know if they should be slightly modified.

But we came here on New Year’s Eve, so the price-performance ratio is not high at nearly a thousand.
The house is too old and the internet is broken. I have been using the internet from other rooms. The conditioner was empty when it arrived the night it arrived, but was replaced after being notified the next day. The water in the shower was not hot. I called for repairs and adjusted the valve and it was ok. The bedside phone suddenly rang hands-free and couldn't be turned off, so I had to unplug it. Toilet ice pp. The overall feeling is that it needs renovation.
Then there was a time when the food was delivered to the concierge, but it was not delivered for a long time. I called and asked why no one delivered it for so long. The reply was that no one told me to deliver it? This answer lacks emotional intelligence and is not polite. It feels like management is still lacking.

I was quite surprised when I entered the room. Unexpectedly, I was directly upgraded to a deluxe suite. The room is large and has two bathrooms. I really like the bathroom with panoramic floor-to-ceiling windows in the bedroom. The breakfast is also ok and has a complete range of items. In addition, the swimming pool on the 9th floor is very nice and children like it very much. The location of the hotel is also good. It is not far from major scenic spots and it is very convenient to take a taxi. It is recommended to stay here!

Sophia contacted me the day before check-in and told me that the room had been upgraded. After arriving, the children received small gifts, welcome fruits, and good night milk. The service is absolutely fine. The children's favorite is the starry sky swimming pool, they have a lot of fun. However, the breakfast was very average. I couldn't find anything I wanted to eat. One of the lights in the room was broken and the lighting was poor. The overall experience is still very good.

msg:In a five-star hotel, I stayed in a 60-square-meter city-view room. It was very big, but "old" is a literal term. The staff's service was excellent. The fruits in the room were not replaced even after I dropped them. There was no replenishment. The shower gel and conditioner were all empty bottles and could not be used that night. I told the lobby the next day that there would be replenishment. The TV remote control did not work very well and the air conditioner was also problematic. Only the heater worked. The temperature was sweltering and it couldn't be changed by lowering the temperature. I stayed for 4 nights. The advantage is that the swimming pool is very good and comfortable, and the view from the room is very good. Because I live on the 45th floor, I can really see far and high. The breakfast is average, but the ramen in the hotel is the best ramen I have ever tasted, better than the one in Japan. The location is city center.

msg:Sofitel Hotel Nanjing added a lot of impression points to the trip
The hotel I originally booked was temporarily informed that there were no rooms available, so I chose this old hotel by chance!
The customer service contacted me the day before check-in to inquire about my needs.
Arrive at Nanjing Silk and check in... The children dropped their luggage and couldn't wait to go straight to the swimming pool. At first, they were worried that it would be cold in this season. The hotel is heated enough that an air conditioner fan is needed, so there is no need to worry about freezing!
The customer service lady knew it was the child's birthday, so she prepared check-in gifts and birthday cakes in advance. She kept asking when would be the best time to deliver cakes and snacks to the room in a timely manner. I really loved the attentive service. It felt like home in a strange city!
The upgraded room type has large floor-to-ceiling windows. Looking down at Jinling City, the entire city is red and yellow. It is a warm color system that I have to love!
The location is excellent and parking is convenient. You can get to Confucius Temple and Jiming Temple by subway within half an hour. It is three stops away from the zoo and 1 kilometer walk from the hotel to the subway entrance! Breakfast and dinner are rich!

           Breakfast doesn’t even include Nanjing’s specialty soup dumplings. ╭(╯ε╰)╮The fruit varieties for breakfast are the same every day, watermelon, grapefruit, and orange ╮(︶﹏︶)╭The buffet hot pot base for dinner👍 🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻(∗❛ั∀❛ั∗)✧* The price/performance ratio is not very high. I don’t know how it was rated as a gourmet hotel! ! !
Room: Upgraded to a 60-square-meter double room. The room is quite big.
Facilities: I have to complain about this. On the day of check-in on December 7, the outdoor temperature was over 20 degrees. After check-in, I turned on the air conditioner to cool down, but the temperature in the room did not drop but rose. It turns out that starting from September, hotel room air conditioners will no longer provide cooling, only heating! =_=(´-﹏-`;) Putting aside the star rating of the hotel itself, why is there only heating but no cooling? There is a cooling "❄️" icon on the air conditioning control panel, and there is no prompt that the air conditioner is heating or not cooling. 📺, I can’t accept the screencasting, but I haven’t watched it back‼ (•'╻'• )꒳ᵒ꒳ᵎᵎᵎ
The location of the hotel is still ok! Didi takes a taxi to Nanjing Museum for 25 yuan. Shopping is also convenient. Very close to my pleasure. There are many restaurants and snack shops around the hotel!

The guest rooms are clean and the bathroom space is not cramped. The front desk service specialist arranged a higher floor according to our requirements. It is quiet and not noisy, and the view is very broad. The overall feeling is very good and cost-effective. When the subway station next to the hotel is built, transportation will be more convenient.

msg:I came to Nanjing on a business trip and took advantage of the weekend to visit this Jinling city.

Taking full consideration of convenient transportation, experienced foodies, brand requirements, and cost-effectiveness, we chose Sofitel Galaxy Hotel.

I arrived at the hotel a little early and the room was not ready yet. I would like to express my sincere thanks to Jodie who checked in. She spent a short time helping to clean up a room and informed her that she had been upgraded to an executive deluxe king room.

It’s also because while waiting for cleaning, I can slowly visit the Sofitel Nanjing.

The hotel opened in 2013, so it is already a few years old, but the state of maintenance is pretty good, and the design is not outdated. The location is excellent. It is located on Shanxi Road, and there are a lot of food on Matai Street next to it, so you can go to scenic spots and business districts. Not too far.

The executive deluxe double room is designed with a large bay, which is very open and has a very good view. It overlooks the entire city of Nanjing. The old photos of Nanjing in the room are also worth looking at.

It is estimated that few people will watch the TV in the hotel. I am a relatively leisurely person. If you know less about Nanjing, I highly recommend watching the introduction to the history of Nanjing on TV. It will be very useful during your subsequent trip to Nanjing. big help

The small sofa by the window is very artistic. It is very relaxing to sit on the sofa at night, watch the night view of Nanjing, and eat the late night snacks provided by the hotel.

While providing late night snacks, the hotel also provides sleep-aid milk, which shows the hotel's efforts in customer experience.

Due to time constraints, I did not experience the hotel's catering and related services. If I have a next trip to Nanjing, I will choose it again.

My first impression after arriving at the hotel is that the front desk service is enthusiastic and greets guests as soon as possible, which is very good! The front desk lady Gloria instantly became a housekeeper, and there was no need for a phone call during the whole process. WeChat solved all needs. Free upgrade to a high floor with lake view. In the morning, you can see the lake and mountains under the rising sun, which is an unexpected bonus.

On the way to the room after checking in, I discovered that the elevator entrances on each floor are equipped with landline phones and free mineral water. This is really for the sake of customers.

The late night snacks are good, and they are all famous snacks in Nanjing.

Let’s talk about the hotel’s location. It’s very close to Shiziqiao Pedestrian Street and Yihe Road Xuanwu Lake Park, both of which can be reached on foot. It’s also very convenient to travel. All in all, my stay this time was very good!

A hotel that was opened in 2006 and renovated 13 years ago is really good.

I was lucky enough to meet Gloria at the front desk who was professional and attentive during the check-in process. She didn't say much but clearly introduced the breakfast time and location, how to use the late night snack coupon (although it is not required) and the lounge privilege time. She also checked the system by the way. The room was upgraded and the whole process was very comfortable.

Because the lounge is not open, you can directly use the buffet on the 7th floor for executive benefits. The food is okay and everything is available, but the management of the chef is not available at all. The important thing is, if you pay by yourself, don’t go to this buffet!

The room facilities are all normal, the water pressure is great and very comfortable.

First of all, the service is very good. I came early, and LUNA at the front desk also checked in. The room type was also upgraded. The floor is high and the room is very spacious, making it very comfortable to stay. The whole process of service was excellent, including delivering food, helping with flash delivery, etc. They were very meticulous and timely, and worthy of praise. The housekeeping aunt is also very thorough in cleaning.
Secondly, the facilities are pretty good. Although it is an old five-star hotel, it has complete facilities and equipment, including a swimming pool and gym. The swimming pool is constant temperature and the opening hours are relatively generous. The room is large and the bed is relatively soft and comfortable. There are also buckwheat pillows and Latex pillows and the like are all available.
Finally, the hotel's location is ideal for city walks. It's very close to Yihe Road and Pioneer Bookstore. There are also convenience stores next to the hotel, such as Wuyue Plaza and Lion Bridge. It is also very close to Xuanwu Lake, about ten minutes away, which is very convenient and beautiful to take pictures.
The overall stay experience is very good, Luna's service is also very good, I will come again next time!

The bathroom and the living room are separated by a curtain. The air-conditioning switch is so old that I have never seen a mobile phone signal. The wireless network is also very poor and intermittent. In short, it is too far away from what I expected. The last city I checked was at the Sofitel Jinan. It was very good. I came to Nanjing and booked the Sofitel directly. I didn’t expect the gap to be so big and difficult to accept.

Jodie at the front desk upgraded my room as required, but I found it was far from the room I originally stayed in, so I asked if I could change it. She changed me to a room that was closer to the style of my original room. As a resident who is reminiscing about the past, this is a great comfort.

The bedding remains the same and the quality is very good. Breakfast was also good. recommend :)

She collected all the questions immediately and solved them as quickly as possible. Because there were some things that I didn’t like about the original room, she helped me quickly change and upgrade the room; the service was super. good! The key point is that the young lady is so beautiful hahahaha
I also like the aunt who cleans the guest room. I happened to be in the room when she was cleaning. I asked her to replenish the tea bags and asked me which flavor I like and can I put more~

I also gave my baby a small gift when I checked in.
 We also went to check out the swimming pool. Unfortunately, it was inconvenient for my wife and aunt to go into the water, so I had to come next time.
The only shortcoming is that maybe there are so many people that we didn’t directly upgrade the parent-child room. I hope that we can upgrade it next time we come back🤣
A small suggestion, you can put a small duck swimming circle in the parent-child room, so that the younger children can also play with water in the bathroom~

Although the facilities are high-end, they are old and lifeless. The breakfast is really lackluster. There are many varieties that cater to both Chinese and Western tastes, but there is nothing worth eating. There is nothing worth having for breakfast a second time.

msg:A super satisfied hotel, please evaluate it carefully. When I first checked in, the lady at the front desk told me to upgrade me to a bigger room for free, because when I made the reservation, it showed more than 40 square meters, which is already very big. The lady said to upgrade to a bigger room. I was very grateful to her at the time. When I got to the room, I saw it. My God, it was so big that it was beyond imagination. It felt more than 60 square meters. The children were shocked when they entered the door. The room is too big. There are cloakrooms, bathtubs, and showers. The toilets are all separated, and it costs more than 600 yuan to live in such a big room, which is still a five-star. Not to mention anything else, the room alone is worth it. The welcome fruit is prepared in the room, and the taste is very good. The hotel's swimming pool is also very powerful. On the 9th floor, there is a dome directly above it. The water temperature is very suitable, and the children have a great time. Let’s talk about the hotel’s breakfast, which is very Jinling-style. Duck blood vermicelli soup and red bean glutinous rice balls all taste very good. Of course, the breakfast variety is very rich, and there is nothing to be picky about. The only thing is that the hotel facilities are a little old, but there is nothing It doesn't affect the accommodation experience, and the other things are enough to overcome such a little flaw. It seems that the hotel is doing service very carefully. I will choose this one next time I go to Nanjing.

msg:Generally speaking, I am satisfied. There are not many good hotels here in Shimonoseki. Sofitel is considered good, and it was used as a quarantine hotel during the epidemic. ￼I have stayed many times, and I like his swimming pool very much.
￼Service: It's not bad, but there are too many people during the summer vacation, and there is a long queue to open a room.
Environment: Not bad. There is an executive lounge on the roof. The afternoon tea is delicious and not expensive. There are few things for breakfast, so there is nothing to eat. I haven't eaten the lunch buffet. There are 2k omakase per capita on the seventh floor.
Facilities: This is the hotel I want to complain about most. There are too few elevators and there are too many people. There are only three elevators. It takes a long time to wait for an elevator on forty or fifty floors, and only one goes to the underground parking lot. There is also check-in, and it is useless to lose the license plate. Every time you go out, you have to go to the first floor to enter the license plate again. Isn’t this a trap? Can't you set the entire stay length? When I went out in the morning, I forgot to lose too early, so I paid the parking fee myself.
Hygiene: It's okay, but the sound insulation of the room is very poor, and the door next door can be heard clearly￼.

msg:Very poor, highly not recommended.
1. Three rooms of equal value, with different sizes. Two rooms have bathtubs and one does not. The online promotion and pricing classification of room types are completely confusing compared to the actual arrangement experience.
2. I checked in at the front desk at three o'clock in the afternoon, but there was still a room available. It seems that when you ask this question, your hotel has a little bit of service awareness: say a few nice words, promise to contact the guest as soon as the room is available, and arrange to send the room card to the guest's room...
Even a non-hotel service person like me can think of the above.
But how does your hotel operate? It will only say "the room cannot be vacated, because there is no room and there is nothing you can do"...
It was almost four o'clock in the afternoon, and I had to go to the front desk on the first floor to find a staff member who didn't know the reason. I spent a long time talking and waited for her to check again and again before I could open the last room...
3. The central air conditioning temperature control is really poor. Do you dare to think? On the fifth day of the ***** New Year in winter, the windows were all open, and the heat was unbearable even in the room with my pants and sleeves halfway up. I called the hotel to ask what should I do if it was too hot, and they said there was nothing they could do. The most they could do was get a floor fan. With.
On the fifth day of the ***** New Year, I slept with the fan on all night

The location is very good. The taxi fare to Xinjiekou, Nanjing Station, and Hongshan Zoo is less than 20 yuan. This year, I took my children to stay in many hotels in Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai every weekend during the summer vacation. Sofitel is the most family-friendly and cost-effective one.
The front desk staff, Ryan, was enthusiastic and efficient when checking in. He took the initiative to help us upgrade the room, introduced the hotel facilities, and even helped us delay the check-out the next day. Traveling with children is no longer embarrassing.
The deluxe city view king bed room is very spacious, with good sound insulation, a writing desk and a sofa, and the bedding is also very comfortable. There are floor-to-ceiling windows on the entire wall, and the view is excellent.
Because the weather was too hot, I spent most of the two days swimming in the hotel. The panoramic canopy glass roof, the water depth of the adult area is 1.5 meters, and the children's pool has many floating boards for swimming laps, and the water quality is very good.
Very comfortable stay experience, I will book this hotel next time I come to Nanjing!

Late check-out until 14:00 (depending on room availability): I called and said I wanted to delay check-out because I had this service when I booked and was told that it was 12:00 check-out. I asked if my order had this service. I hesitated for a while Later, I can understand that the room is tight during the peak travel period as soon as possible, but I hope the attitude can be better
Service: I checked in at the hotel after 4:00 am and was told that there was no room available and I had to wait for an hour. After expressing my dissatisfaction with this, I said that I could open up two rooms

Although it is a simple chicken noodle, it is surprisingly delicious. The decoration and facilities will be old, but if the sanitation and service are good, it can be offset. When I finally checked out, I asked about the parking fee, because I asked it again and again, and the attitude of the front desk was a little impatient. In terms of location, it’s not far from Yihe Road on foot, and you can take a taxi or drive to other places

The location of the hotel is also very convenient, not far from major popular attractions, and it is very convenient to eat around. The elderly at home lived very happily. The hotel's buffet breakfast and lunch are also very rich. The staff are very nice. If you need anything, call the customer service center and they will always solve it in time.

msg:I hardly write reviews, but it is so bad that I have to write a few words.
The reservation is for the executive floor to live on the 43rd floor, and I took a few detailed pictures for you to take a look at. If the executive floor is like this, let alone the rest of the floors.
Dirty and messy, three words can sum it up.
On the first day of check-in, the surname of Wang (Huang) at the front desk is a middle-aged woman who works on the day shift.
She watched me line up with wide eyes, but kept taking over the check-out of the queue, and asked her if her eyesight was good, and answered me, check-out is faster, and it will be ready soon.
I reminded her that I came to the front desk to pick up the card for the second time, because your room is still unpacked, she still spoke coldly to each other, I have already called room service, but no one answered, so please continue to wait.
Is this the attitude you should have? ? ?
Check in the room, step into the room, the dust that has not been cleaned for a long time can be seen everywhere, this can be proved by pictures, it is not my nonsense.
Do not open windows in this room. The air conditioner shows 21 degrees, but it is hot and sweaty. The engineering depar**ent said that there is no way to solve the problem with the central air conditioner. Bring me an electric fan. It is really funny, except for the front of the administrative room, which is 37 degrees in Nanjing With the high temperature these days, you need to use an electric fan to stay in the hotel.
In my opinion, the hotel doesn’t need to reply to me after seeing this review, it can just close the door, even a 200 yuan Home Inn can’t do such a thing, I will email the Accor headquarters later.

1: One advertises 5🌟, enters the lobby, and cannot hear the greeting of mission welcome
2: The sheets were dirty and torn; a waiter came to change them; they said they were not responsible, and the responsible waiter was off work
3: No one answered the phone 5 times; no one answered the concierge, no one answered the room
4: After answering the call, instead of saying "Sorry, I didn't receive it", it said "The line is busy", why can't I distinguish between a busy line and a connected line?
5: A lady called and opened her mouth. Instead of saying "Is there anything I can do for you...", but "Is there anything I can do for you?" If I'm fine, why call you, don't you Do you want to chat?
6: The TV is also broken, and the engineer spent a long time repairing it; there is no service throughout the whole process, ask if it can be repaired...
7: In the end, I can only communicate through Ctrip; the whole hotel does not have a waiter in the room to check whether the phone is not working; whether the TV can be watched;
8: This is the first time I have encountered such a hotel service, and I seldom hear service terms such as "Excuse me"
9: Did the Accor Group also start an "epidemic" after the epidemic?
10: I don’t know how Ctrip audits and manages suppliers~

1. There was an abnormal sound at the head of the bed in the room. After checking by the staff, it was the vibration caused by the air conditioner. The solution is to turn down the air conditioner.
Second, only one side of the bed has a socket. There is no facial tissue on both sides of the bed and other tables in the room. If you need facial tissue, you have to go to the bathroom to get it. The same trash can is only available in the bathroom.
3. The door of the shower room is pushed inward, but it will hit the shower head of the top spray.
4. Jinling's special supper set meal is not the same as the one in the promotion.
5. On the first day of check-in, when parking, under the guidance of the staff, the wheel hub was successfully scratched.
Sixth, the toilet flush button is outrageously broken. How to flush the water has been studied for a while~
All in all, the experience is very, very bad. It's a pity that I can't score 0 points...

msg:The last time I stayed during the May Day holiday was 12 years ago and I chose the old five-star brand again, but the software and hardware are obviously behind. First of all, the 4 elevators are not enough during the holidays, and one of them only runs on the first floor and the underground, so the guests have basically encountered it. The problem of waiting for the elevator for a long time, no matter whether it is upstairs or downstairs, and the facilities in the room are aging seriously. They are not cleaned up in time. There are shirtless guests in the gym for a long time. The staff did not remind the hotel that the surrounding environment has changed a lot. It’s not a problem, but the quality is really not up to par. I believe the hotel itself should know that Sofitel was still a first-tier five-star hotel ten years ago, and now it’s on the verge of five-star. The family saw the milk that the child drank (picture 9 and 10 sent by the hotel) or forget it. The ingredients are not pure milk, but technological and hard-working drinks. No matter how expensive* I can’t accept it and can’t understand it. Of course, if I can see this at a glance It’s a drink, so that’s another matter. In summary, I don’t think it’s a big problem at the usual price of 600 or 700. It’s really not worth double the price on holidays. In short, if the hotel can’t greatly improve its quality or change the surrounding environment, I guess this will be the standard for tour groups in the future.” In a five-star hotel

This hotel is supposed to be for group business. The day before check-out on weekdays, many people lined up, which caused the things we ordered to be delivered for a long time, saying that they were too busy.
The toilet buttons are also broken, too lazy to change rooms, we may not consider staying in this hotel next time

②It takes a long time to select a floor every time you enter the elevator and swipe your card. It is really too old. Can you upgrade?
③The safe is out of power, it means everyone is worthless by default, right?

Service: I called to ask about the air conditioner, and a woman said, "If you think it's cold, just turn it off."

Environment: It's ok, just put an urn in the corridor. I really can't appreciate the decoration. I was scared to death at night.

Stayed for two nights, it was very troublesome to go out every time, it was far, far from the city

Service: There are relatively few check-in counters at the same time. It may be because the equipment is relatively old and the speed will be relatively slow. Helped with luggage and took us to the room;
Room: The area is very spacious and you can directly see the complete city view. The room you booked also includes the first free drink from the minibar and supper. The bathroom and shower room use top bathroom brands such as Hansgrohe, Duravit, Kohler and Toto;
Gym: Surprisingly, the gym uses three top brands of treadmills: Precor, Technogym, and Life Fitness. It is suitable for fitness enthusiasts who want to try it. The swimming pool is also very large and beautiful, with a transparent roof where you can see the sky. At the concierge office, I saw a five-star brand and a concierge with an international golden key~ It was really a worthwhile trip

Overall very recommended~

Definitely the last time. First of all, the male receptionist asked for WeChat or phone number, but he didn't give me his phone number. Then, his face was stamped with gold. It seemed that someone wanted to stay in their room. I didn't know if he was going to the police directly. We really need to check whether the police want this thing or someone else wants it. It would be nice if the mess in the lobby could be managed. There was a musty smell when I entered the room and I was told that it had been arranged to be cleaned a long time ago. The bedding is really cheap. In such a big hotel, there is no waiter in the room, and no one answers the phone. I’ve never seen a five-star hotel where no one answered the phone. The room booked on Ctrip was 160 RMB less than that of other hotels... It seems that cheating has become the norm. No credibility. Anyway, break up

msg:Do not book this Sofitel Galaxy when you come to Nanjing!
We brought our children to Nanjing to play on weekends. I booked a superior twin room. After checking into the room on the 35th floor around 11:00 p.m., I found the room was small and old. The TV was only about 21 inches. The old paint on the furniture was peeled off, and there was dust on the table. A star hotel is like a guest house, it is really not as good as a chain hotel, and it is seriously inconsistent with the grand and luxurious lobby. After we put forward our opinions to the front desk, we first said that there is no room tonight and we cannot change it, and that all the superior double rooms are like this, and we also admitted that the hotel has not been renovated for many years. After negotiating, we were finally changed to a deluxe twin room on the 30th floor. The room was much bigger (see photo). Although it was old, it was passable. It was almost 12 o'clock at this time.
The next night we went back to the hotel to take a bath and rest. My wife turned on the shower, and the water was cold. I thought the water would gradually heat up, but the water temperature was only a little bit hot during the whole process, but it was not at all the temperature for bathing. So My wife was shivering after washing. By the way, the supper sent by Ctrip took more than half an hour to arrive. It was said to be freshly made, but there was only a bowl of small wontons and two cakes, and the small wontons basically had no meat.
I reported the water temperature problem to the hotel, and I went to the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum that day, and I was very tired and returned to the hotel without hot water, so I suddenly became angry. The manager on duty came up to test the water temperature, and it was true that the water temperature was not too hot. The manager's attitude was not bad, and he kept apologizing. But neither the child nor I have bathed yet. They said to change rooms, there was a suite available and we didn't because we had to pack our bags. The duty manager suggested that we go to the suite on the 40th floor to take a shower and then come down after the shower. My wife got a heater so I went up to the 40th floor with toiletries and a change of clothes, the suite was just as old, with dust on the glass and table tops. My son and I both took a shower and took a break. It was past 12 o'clock and we were too tired. Check out the room the next day and leave the hotel.
This is the most wonderful experience. When you stay in a five-star hotel, you actually take a towel and go to other rooms to take a shower, just like the guest house in the 1970s. It's a shame, it's a shame for the Accor Group, a global Sofitel, and Nanjing. The hotel was willing to compensate us. At the beginning, it was a 68 yuan noon buffet voucher (it was proposed at 10:30, and we had just finished breakfast). Besides, we had to leave Nanjing in the afternoon. After their internal discussion, it was changed to a 20% discount on the room rate. Based on the attitude of the hotel's superiors squeezing toothpaste, I did not accept the 20% discount. In the end, the compensation plan they gave was to reduce the room fee for one night.
Dear friends from Ctrip, even if I accept a certain compensation, I still want to remind you who are looking at this hotel, be careful!
However, I have to say that Ctrip's customer service has been helping me communicate with the hotel throughout the process, thank you very much.

The room is really big, the floor is high, and the floor-to-ceiling windows have a great view. The afternoon tea included in the package is in the executive lounge. There are few people, and the experience is great. It will not be embarrassing to keep patting and patting after changing into Hanfu. The afternoon tea looks so good, I like the color of the cup. The swimming pool is very special. It has a glass roof. You can bathe in the sun and swim. It's comfortable. Although some facilities are slightly different from those of the newly opened hotel, the price/performance ratio of the hotel is still super high in terms of location, room and service.

Knowing that it was a five-star hotel for a long time, I thought the facilities would be very old, but it was very comfortable to live in, and I saw that I came with my grandma. The service is also super good, the elevator is super fast hahahaha (digression) and the mattress lady! ! ! ! ! I feel comfortable and I really want to take it home 🥹🥹 I don’t want to go out to play the next day, I want to lie on the bed! Breakfast is also quite a variety! Nanjing has its own characteristics! delicious

Hygiene: I saw a lot of people talking about hygiene problems. I didn't see any hygiene problems in the room. The overall is very clean! Very comfortable, but the glass can be wiped hahahaha, the night scene will be more beautiful🥹

Environment: I have seen it before coming here! The location is super good. It is really my treasure hotel. If I have the opportunity to go to Nanjing in the future, I will definitely come back and stay for a long time! Downstairs is Papa Xing, opposite is Lawson! There are a lot of delicious food nearby! There is also a central shopping mall next to it! All in all it is great value for money! ! ! !
Service: I came very late at that time, and I was very worried that there was no room, because I wanted to take my grandma to see the night view. The front desk manager, brother Vin, heard the request and helped us upgrade the room for free! And a good location on a high floor! And respond to requests! I love it so much! Because we saw that we were tourists from Chengdu, we carefully asked about the travel plan to help plan, and recommended a lot of delicious places! The bellboys at the door are super nice and handsome! ! ! Every staff member is very gentle and I am embarrassed to speak! It's just that the luggage is too heavy and weighs them down hahaha! Brother Vin is so kind! Will come to Nanjing to meet again! ! !
Jinling Special Supper Package: This needs to be delivered by phone before 10 o'clock, I was thinking about supper and I forgot it

Late check-out until 14:00 (depending on room availability): Because the hotel is so comfortable, I wanted to rest after coming back at noon and found that the check-out at 2 o'clock was too urgent, so I contacted brother Vin to see if he could pay for late check-out, brother Vin is very good He told us to delay until four or five o'clock and then come out! Goodwill doubled! ! ! Really love it, I literally love it to death! My Treasure Hotel!
Free mini bar: There are all kinds of water, Evian mineral water, Coke Sprite, all for free! So comfortable! Because it was a sudden decision to come to Nanjing! Already in love with the city of Nanjing🥲🥲

You can walk to Yihe Road and Xuanwu Lake New Street mouth is very convenient. I bought a travel photo package and stayed in a deluxe room with floor-to-ceiling glass, overlooking Xuanwu Lake. The room is very large and comfortable. The lady at the front desk gave me four sets of clothes to choose from. I chose the one full of spring colors to match the Yihe Road with the style of the Republic of China. The pink cheongsam is very popular. The afternoon tea included in the package is on the 46th floor of the hotel, with a great view, overlooking the entire Nanjing city and the Yangtze River, and taking pictures in the executive lounge full of French romance is also full of a**osphere. Every service staff I met was very enthusiastic and friendly, and overall it was a satisfactory travel experience.

From the concierge at the door, to the carefulness of a big lady at the front desk (seeing that we are bringing a child, she immediately provided the child's slippers and toothbrush). In particular, I would like to mention a guy named Jack at the front desk. Because we entered the room for the first time and felt that the room type was not what we liked, we called the front desk and said that we wanted to change rooms. The front desk was also very busy at the time, but Jack still patiently and carefully helped us inquire. I found a vacant room, and thoughtfully changed to the next room nearby, thank you again!
In addition, the room we booked has supper, the little chaos is delicious

msg:It’s not a vacation or a business trip, there are budget constraints, and hotels in urban areas are not like resort hotels. Our family of five lives in a small child, and the choice of room type is very limited. There is no riz room type in the Hanbilou swimming pool, which exceeds the budget. Hilton Marriott Shangri-La is too I had a meal at Far Jinling Hotel and thought it was too old-fashioned. Finally, I contacted Sofitel to book the price. I had no expectations at all. I booked a suite and an extra twin bed and got a Unicom room. I can’t use the standards of Amman to ask for this price. The hotel experience is just that. Super cost-effective five-star service. The hotel has been decorated for a long time, but it can be seen that it has been carefully maintained. Otherwise, the man who received me would not have received me like this over the years. He is probably very skilled in the business. Which room in the hotel What type of room was it and when did I leave? My mind was very clear. In the elevator, I told my husband that the boss was really lucky to meet this kind of employee. The skin care products in the suite are Lavin’s standard room. Isn’t it okay? Mineral water and ice dew are a bit weak. There is a gap between the cognition and the person who received me. The executive lounge is currently closed. The elevator room in the ba*****t and the changing room in the gym should be renovated as soon as possible, but a hotel worth 1,000 yuan can’t demand the standard of a top hotel. The price and service are worthy of five-star praise.

I booked an executive suite for two days on New Year's Eve on the 29th of the twelfth ***** month. I didn't really want to live in the picture, but I accepted it because of the size.
The actual room effect is much better than the pictures on the Internet, the area is larger than expected, the decoration color is very warm, the air conditioning effect is also good, the 45th floor has a wide view, the night view is beautiful, and the overall comfort is very good
The guy at the front desk, Jason, was very enthusiastic. He helped unpack the courier and delivered it to the room in person. The auntie also thoughtfully prepared welcome fruit and fruit tea for bathing. It made me feel very kind when I was tired during the Spring Festival. Thank you very much.
I was particularly satisfied with the service in the suite of a five-star hotel in Nanjing
Decisively stay for another two days

msg:The facilities are outdated, you can’t take a shower during Chinese New Year, the washbasin can’t release hot water, and you can brush your teeth with cold water. The water flow in the shower room is as shown in the picture. The water flow is so small that you have to stick to the wall to get water. The water temperature is still below 30°C. Shower The room came out cold and shivering. Is this a five-star hotel? Reported to the hotel, the reply said that the main reason was that the business of the hotel during the Spring Festival was so good that it was too late to supply hot water, so there was no further information. Don't you know the supply capacity of the hotel? If the business is good, you should make money and the customers will be unlucky? !
What's also outrageous is that I booked the executive floor of the hotel, but it was arranged on the ordinary floor when I checked in. Because I was very familiar with this hotel, I told the front desk that this was not an executive room. The front desk knowingly said that it was an executive room. Later I According to Ctrip’s feedback, the room was finally changed, but the management also shirked responsibility and said that the front desk made a mistake. I said it was not a mistake at all. If there is no management’s instruction, how dare the front desk blatantly change the house and replace it with a shoddy one? I was in a bad mood at the beginning of the new year, and I wasted more than three hours to change rooms. I wanted to forget about it, but the various experiences after checking in were really disappointing. Sofitel is no longer the quality it was many years ago. Yes, from hardware to software services can only be evaluated as poor. I booked a room for two days. I originally wanted to change the hotel the next day. Considering that there are elderly people living there, I can forget it.
In addition, the hotel's self-operated Chinese restaurant is also very poor. During the Spring Festival, it is said that there is no a la carte, only set meals. The menu name looks good, but in fact it is all flashy and very stale dishes, let alone any cooking skills , many frozen and heated dishes, said to be Huaiyang's specialties, but in the end, they didn't even have the most common rice field eels, and lied that they couldn't buy them, even rice field eels.

Our car is a medium and large SUV. It is very difficult to find a parking space that can be parked. Besides, the interior design can be said to be excellent It’s unreasonable. The introduction is 40 square meters, but it feels the smallest, especially when I just came from Shangge, which has first-class facilities. It’s too cramped. ps Shangge is also similar in size. The bathroom design fails and there’s only 20— It's 30 centimeters away, there's no door, it's just a curtain, so it's not suitable for a family to live in, right? There's no clothes rack
Hygiene: Hygiene is nothing to say, the level that a five-star should have
Environment: The lobby is not big. It’s not gorgeous after so many years, so it’s fine. Especially one thing to say is that it’s too cold when we arrived in Nanjing. It rained for the first time and we shivered after taking a shower. Compared with the hotel, I froze to death. It is the worst hotel among the five hotels in this trip. There is no heating.
Service: All the staff I have been in contact with can do their duty. The front desk is very good. I even gave the little yellow duck slippers to the children. It’s a pity that they are too big and I can’t return them.
Jinling Special Supper Package: This is very good and the response is delicious
Late check-out until 14:00 (depending on room availability): I also enjoy it
Also, the location is not so convenient. The nearest eating place nearby has to walk at least 500 meters to Lion Street. Chicken Ming Tangbao is still very good, and Duck Blood Vermicelli Soup is downstairs. Star Papa, but it opens very late and crosses the road. Jian Luosen eats a lot less than Beijing Luosen, is it a bit of luck?
Free mini bar: I also enjoy it

The front desk has a good and friendly attitude. He took the initiative to upgrade the room and gave a chicken soup and small wonton stewed breakfast. This is very considerate~

However, because the hotel itself has a certain age, the equipment in the room is relatively old, and there are no smart toilet mats equipped in basic five-star hotels. And there are more stains in the small corners of the bathroom, which is a bit deduction.

But overall the price is pretty good. It will be even better if it is refurbished, and I will stay again if I have a chance~

The breakfast is not bad. It has everything you need. You can eat and stay more attentively
But the small disadvantage is that the hotel’s mineral water uses ice dew/It’s a bit far from the subway station and it takes 20 minutes to walk/The gym and swimming pool are not open without prior notice😭
Generally speaking, it is still a very cost-effective hotel. It is still the first choice when you come to Nanjing next time

He was very enthusiastic and patiently answered many of our questions. When the children got the little yellow duck toiletry bag and special children's slippers, they jumped up excitedly. The hotel room is on the 38th floor. The room is very comfortable. The only regret is that the hotel's swimming pool is under renovation.

Because of the epidemic, my child's art test is about to stay here. The hotel used inferior chairs and used chairs with four nails in the undercut, which caused my child's feet to be poked in by all the nails! ! !
It will directly delay the child's next art test! The child was still pushed out by the wheelchair the next day, and the relatives the family asked to pick up the child felt distressed!
The hateful thing is that the person in charge of the hotel didn't give condolences until the next day! The follow-up person in charge is extremely conceited! A can-do attitude, emphasizing that you are sick and cannot solve it! As customers, we are still thinking about how to solve this problem with a fever! We resist to communicate your attitude! Can't you handle that the hotel is empty! Do our customers still have to worry about the internal management of the hotel!
We who were customers on Saturday sympathized with being sick and agreed to wait until Monday to give us a solution! And let this person have a good rest, it is not easy for everyone at the moment of the epidemic! We just need a solution! But what we got in exchange for our understanding was the extremely bad attitude of the person in charge on Monday. Every sentence was evading responsibility and there was no sincere apology! From beginning to end, evading responsibility and talking about solutions are all we can do, that's how we are! Been talking about not being able to give cash or something! We ask you guys for cash! How many hundred dollars do we need? Can we exchange for the health of our children! !
Have you guys given a solution from beginning to end! Not a single solution, not a single attitude! ! We didn't make unreasonable demands either! Not a single sincere apology! It seems to be an old fritter, she emphasized that she has actively dealt with it, but she doesn't even know what happened, and she keeps saying that she doesn't want to do this. If something happened, we came to stay because the child was injured!
Who understands our mood! What a world! What we want is a statement and an attitude! Our family is also sick, who would let the children stay in a hotel if they are not sick! Now I have to accept the impact of the hotel on my children! The college entrance examination is so important!
Now the child can't practice and can't go to class! The hotel can't guarantee the safety of customers. The use of poor-quality and old furniture caused deep-seated safety problems. The child was in pain and cried all night on the night of the 23rd! Are you in charge? What if it is a baby brought by another customer! The lives of the four nails are gone! You don't even have basic respect for customers! Still asking us to understand you! understand what you are!
Only one child in our family was negative. In the end, we found the hospital by ourselves. We were afraid that the child would not be able to take the test. We tried to keep the child from contact with the outside world as much as possible. As a result, we sent the child to the hospital for tetanus to see a doctor! Finally, our children are unable to attend class on time in front of the once-in-a-lifetime college entrance examination. We contact the teacher to do psychological work for the children! ! Finally, we have prepared for the exam for two years, and we take unpredictable risks! As a result you are being aggressive and haggling as if we should bear it! We pay for you, don't we! The child is still lying in bed and collapsed because he could not go to class! God can't tolerate it!

There are also subway stations under construction, which will be more convenient in the future. The service at the front desk of the hotel is very good. Because they are looking for a view, the hotel gave a room on the 41st floor with a very good view. The attitude of most of the service staff is very good, but the service of the doorman in the hotel is very poor. Not only do they not help with the luggage, but also they are very impatient.
The overall facilities of the hotel are quite satisfactory.

I saw that the online reviews were very good, so I chose the Sofitel, and it turned out that I made the right choice. When I checked in, Shirley, the lady at the front desk of the hotel, told me that there were no two rooms on the same floor at the beginning, and then helped me get them and upgraded the room type at the same time, which was so considerate. I am also very satisfied when I enter the room, the space is large enough, and the division of labor in each area of the toilet is clear. The breakfast was highly praised by my parents. There are enough varieties and the taste is good. I ordered a duck blood vermicelli soup. The portion is really the most in the hotel I have stayed in. In the middle of the journey, the hotel waiter was asked to deliver the required items to the door, and the response was very fast. I am very satisfied in all aspects, and will stay here again next time I come to Nanjing.

Living on the 45th floor, watching the night view and the sunrise is great
The room is also big and has a bathtub. Overall it is very comfortable
Some facilities in the room may be old and some are not good enough. For example, the charging socket next to the bed is not easy to use, and the temperature of the air conditioner is not cold enough. If you don't mind, the problem is not as serious as other comments said.
What about breakfast, maybe there are some local characteristics of Nanjing less, it is enough to eat normally
The swimming pool on the 9th floor is also very good. It is open until ten o'clock in the evening, and it has been kept at a constant temperature. It does not feel cold when entering the water at night, which is very good.
The price/performance ratio is still very high. It is really good or not. Only if you really live in it can you know it. I think it is worth it.

3. The service staff is not enthusiastic, it doesn't matter if there is no doorman or guide. The receptionist picks up the guests by yelling to organize the guests to queue up for check-in, which is also rare in express hotels.

The biggest step back in the hotel is the breakfast. I went there at 9:30, and there was nothing to eat. There were only a few scattered guests. It is estimated that The occupancy rate is a bit low, which reduces the quality of breakfast. I just stayed at Novotel Guiyang Panjiang, which is also owned by Accor, and its breakfast is more than one grade higher than this Sofitel. Others can be, the current price is still quite high.

Especially the sun roof swimming pool, there is a shallow pool, adults and children can play, the water quality is still OK. The buffet price is here, the lamb chops and fish are enough, but the western desserts are too sweet. Calling room delivery service, the attitude is good, although it is a little slower occasionally, but it is acceptable. The lunch buffet is convenient and inexpensive. The geographical location is not far from Xuanwu Lake, and there are some cafes and bookstores on the developed Yihe Road. But Shanxi Road really doesn't understand how it is positioned, and it's getting more and more depressed. This is not to blame the hotel, haha.

So the front desk changed a room, but the tiles fell from the bathtub in the second room. I injured my toe, so the manager brought ice cubes and towels for cold compresses and changed the room. I thought it was over, but when I checked out, I found that my shoes were missing. The manager searched the room for an hour before he went to find it. In the end, it should have been the waiter who had to take it out. Do you want me to wear hotel disposable slippers to go home? outrageous

This time it felt like there was no service at all. There is no concierge service in and out of the hotel, no one is seen at all. The room ran out of hot water after taking a shower in the morning, and no one answered the phone. The cleanliness of the room was terrible. It is full of dust, it is black when you touch it casually, and the furniture is also damaged. The front desk does not have the temperament of the staff of an international five-star hotel at all, and they are all older. He spoke very casually, and he wouldn't be so rude when talking to passers-by. The staff of the restaurant are relatively friendly, so this restaurant can be blacklisted.

The facade of a hotel is at the front desk! When I checked in, the receptionist was an intern, but he was employed without any basic training. There was no professional terminology or polite language. , When I checked in, I even sent a WeChat voice saying how to get off work, I have never seen an express hotel, and I was shocked!
The processing speed is also super slow, and the attitude is also very bad. I feel anxious to vote for tai! Later, the more I thought about it, the more angry I was. It was inhuman trea**ent. I followed up with the court and the police station and was interrogated. I complained the next day. An older woman at the front desk, who should be the front desk manager or something, even helped cover up. There was a mistake. Just admit it generously, and cover it up to make people sick. It's called an apology and breakfast, and there is no apology! If two people stay, you will get one breakfast and buy the other for 68. I would like to ask who are you disgusting? I was disgusted when I entered the hotel, and I felt like I was in a small hotel all the time!
The room can only be said to be quite satisfactory. It is an older hotel and the maintenance is not very good.
The breakfast also refreshed my understanding of Sofitel, it's fast.

This hotel experience is very good, I would like to thank two colleagues in the front office: Jessica and Fiona
The two of them are not only hospitable to guests, but also work very professionally, and patiently answer various questions of the guests, such as where to do nucleic acid nearby.
Kudos to the hotel staff 👍👍

🧹Hygienic: Very clean, the waiter also gave a handwritten blessing, uppercase and intimate.
🔔Service: The happiest thing is that the young lady at the front desk is super awesome. I upgraded the executive deluxe room which is twice the size and is still my favorite high-rise. Although there are not many choices in the restaurant, the service is pretty good. Haha😄

Disadvantages: Yes, because it is an old hotel, the decoration equipment is slightly old and not modern and intelligent.

While the front desk upgraded the room type, I found that the bed had been turned down after entering the room, which is a pleasant surprise under the current trend of streamlined services in many hotels. Going out is Yihe Road. It can be said that the hotel and the city have preserved some of the passing charm of Ningcheng.

我定的是攜程套餐，含行政樓層的下午茶和晚上簡餐，入住的時候晚了，前台還貼心的提醒説可以第二天晚點退房，吃下午茶。雖然我第二天一早就退房了，但這個服務意識還是要點贊。並且看到六一帶着小朋友，沒含早餐，還大方的送了成人及小孩的早餐，這裏不得不説雅高對小朋友的年齡限制還是很寬鬆的，12歲以下都能免。
行政樓層餐廳在46樓.遠眺可以看到長江，南京電視塔，夕陽下景色優美，簡餐品種不算多，但味道可以，補貨及時，服務態度耐心。
晚上還送甜品夜宵，這整體性價比也太好了吧。

入住前，酒店的房務總監Jessica 提前和我聯繫溝通，瞭解了我們的時間和需求，給安排了寬敞舒適的房間。白天可以遠眺江景和市景，晚上能看到萬家燈火。視野很棒。

入住時，Jessica也熱情地為我們推薦南京的景點和小吃。在入住的三天兩夜裡，不論是詢問訊息還是一些小困難需要解決，我們都得到了迅捷的幫助。

離開時我們的水杯掉在大堂的地上，玻璃碎了還潑了一地的水，工作人員也反應快速，友善專業地處理了我們造成的狼藉。

家人表示這是一次非常愉快的旅行。謝謝Jessica 💐💐💐

對了，酒店的自助餐也很贊，家人吃的很開心。除了配套的自助早餐，我們還嘗試了自助午餐。滿意。

衞生間的洗手池調水温很不適應，水池下水太慢了。作為老牌酒店，大廳應該有翻新或者維護之類，但是室內裝修看得出挺老。

因為工作臨時需要一個房間，本想先過來看下情況再決定要不要定，但遇上Jessica後立馬就決定入住、定了兩晚。
索菲特銀河的環境和設施是毋庸置疑的，尤其是星空泳池很有亮點，更重要的的是Jessica和同事們提供的品質服務，不僅考慮到我的具體需要安排了最合適的房間，而且過程中無微不至、專業細心、很關注客人入住的體驗和感受。
兩晚入住的是城景房，視線開闊、光線充足、可選眺玄武湖，房間內飾和用品也舒適和舒心，有特色宵夜點心等，附近是商業中心，緊挨星巴克，咖啡及時供應，兩天下來，不僅順利完成工作，同時非常愉快和舒心。
無論是商務或旅遊度假都值得首選，謝謝Jessica，後續會再來入住！

金陵特色夜宵套餐：桂花糖芋苗非常香甜，糕點也很軟很糯，送過來的時候還是熱的。
房間內用餐價格也不貴，享受五星級的服務衹需要兩位數真的非常難得！

總體來説非常值得住！本來衹定了一晚，當即續住了！

唯一天氣降温，空調温度達不到，被子要兩床送來一床，另一人冷了有點感冒。夜宵有點牽強，芝麻餅很硬不像是新烤出來的。酒店既然要送就該有特色，哪怕少也要精。

msg:這家索菲特可以算是我住過最差的一家索菲特了。作為一個老酒店，本身設施比較老舊，我可以接受，但衞生間的下水道異味太重了，不關門無法忍受。為了索菲特的行政酒廊服務專門定了行政大床，房間是沒有咖啡機的，茶包是chali，第二天茶葉包沒有補齊，杯子也沒有洗。泳池沒去，不做評價。
最最關鍵的是，法國連鎖品牌索菲特的特色是餐飲，這家的行政酒廊第一天沒有冷切肉，芝士等，酒類選擇幾乎沒有，啤酒都是最便宜的本土爛啤酒，氣泡水衹有屈臣氏，我在杭州索菲特還有voss，蛋糕點心感覺加了一堆添加劑，很難吃。下午茶衹有一盤水果一盤大概5/6個添加劑蛋糕，我們去的時候，服務人員甚至説，因為突然來了很多客人，接待不過來，要我們晚點再去，我環顧了一下，大概也就6/7桌，十幾個阿姨叔叔而已。happy hour直接安排到了7樓自助餐，餐飲有了些熱菜，但冷餐盤裡的肉，芝士好像剩下的，邊緣顏色都發深了。魚生好像虹鱒，吃了一片不敢吃了。早餐也是一塌糊塗，很多菜品的保温做的很差，盛出來都冷了。麪條區的選擇也很少，衹有麪條和老鴨粉絲湯，粉絲湯的鴨肝發苦。衹有煎雞蛋，沒有炒蛋，沒有現場做的蛋卷。西式裏的果醬不知道兑了多少增稠劑，難吃的要命。
如果説是性價比，普通房型我不會説什麼，但行政房，如此踩雷，我真的沒有想到。酒店一個法國管理人員都沒有，大概法國人已經放棄這家索菲特了吧。
最後説一下交通和環境，附近在造地鐵，通了以後可能會好一點。但現在最近的玄武門下來還要走一條荒涼的湖南路，路有點遠，體感不太好。但附近有個美食街吾悦廣場，如果不包任何餐飲，可以去逛逛，都是小吃。
但我應該不會再去了。

你好
2023年11月11日我到南京市出差，在貴酒店住宿一晚，雖然住宿時間不長，但是留下了深刻的印象。
這次入住酒店特別感謝行政酒廊經理（tiffany），11月09日我通過攜程訂購了咱們酒店房間，當日下午程經理打電話問我大概到南京時間，入住酒店是否有什麼特殊要求，我感覺到非常貼心。
      11日到酒店是2點左右，程經理知道我沒有吃中午飯，主動幫我聯繫零點餐飲部門送餐，知道我來出差也幫助我查詢特產，告訴我購買地址。
這次出差非常非常感謝程經理，程經理的熱情，主動，耐心，周到真的讓我受益匪淺，如果有機會再次來南京，我肯定首選咱們酒店。祝酒店生意興隆，財源廣進。

整體來講，唯一的缺陷就是硬件設施。和五星級的標準不相匹配。建議酒店可以維修一下房間，有些地方都脱落了，需要修補。另外電吹風和馬桶希望也更新換代一下。
台上盆和出水口的設計不是很好，稍微開大一些水就會濺出來。
服務方面和早餐還是很值得表揚的  早餐給我的感覺很棒。可以滿足日常需求，口味水準也在線。服務也很好，主動安排寶寶椅和寶寶餐具。

msg:作為距離上次裝修有不少年數的高檔酒店來説，性價比很低，服務衹能説連“中規中矩”都算不上。

房間佈置一看就比較有年代感，但是維持的還不錯，硬裝軟裝總體保養還不錯。

幾個問題：
1. 空調不能調節温度，晚上發現房間裏28.6度，非常悶熱，致電服務部，説的是沒辦法調節中央空調，可以送冷風機來
2. 電視櫃櫃麪傾斜較嚴重
3. 浴缸的淋浴頭會少量漏水，但會積少成多，放了一缸水時候已經滴答了一地，聯繫前台要求打掃和送浴巾，24小時都沒送也沒反饋
4. 次日出門前開了需要打掃提示燈，且本人到前台提醒了此事，晚上回房間發現送了開夜床的牛奶，但是沒有打掃或整理。

建議如果無法實現答應會提供的服務，比如清理積水/送浴巾/打掃衞生，請至少直接與客人溝通，而不是等着客人來多次聯繫你們！

房間寬敞，風景極好，可以鳥瞰到街景和玄武湖。

入住時候很幸運碰到眼鏡帥哥Rax，快速辦理入住，安排相關服務。

45層有風景很好的法式餐廳，但是需要提前一天預訂，當天去無法用餐。

有健身和游泳館，可以準備運動衣，大吃大喝後鍛鍊一下。

位置距離有名的美食街、網紅書店都是步行十分鐘的距離，樓下就是梧桐掩映的居民區，煙火氣十足。

        其次，我訂了一個大床房，一個雙床房，我是看着圖片定的，都是有浴缸的，結果實際和圖片不符，沒有浴缸，這個絕對不應該出現這樣的問題。
        再次，我定的套餐裏，有早餐，mini吧，宵夜，但是宵夜沒送，也沒問。
        最後，我離店後，接到了回訪電話，問我居住體驗，我説不好，那個小姐姐當場就愣住了，好像不知道會有不好這個選項一樣，根本不問為什麼，怎麼了，但凡電話裏，問了我，這個評論我也不寫這麼詳細了。

十五年後帶父母和孩子來玩，雖然湖南路確實落寞了，但是索菲特還是保留了老牌五星的水準。客觀上硬件設施確實有些老化，但服務真的好!酒店十點前有免費夜宵，第一天去夫子廟回來晚了，小朋友説餓了，九點五十七在前台急急忙忙訂了宵夜，也很快幫我們送到房間了。第二天客房服務還特意添加了孩子的備品（因為我們自己帶了，一開始就沒有跟酒店要孩子的備品），可以説是很用心了。酒店的自助早餐也不錯，地理位置優越。
希望索菲特越來越好，期待下次相遇。

msg:這次到南京在素菲特住了四晚。酒店離開地鐵站比較遠，出入必須自己叫車。附近有一个吾悦廣場，離開酒店約700米，在這裡有超市和各種餐飲，酒店對面也有便利店和咖啡店。

值得一讚的是員工服務態度很好，酒店房間很大，有餐廳健身房和泳池，住得比較舒服。酒店免費提供一份金陵夜宵，不過可惜的是我們沒有時間享用。😂

不過設施老舊是这家酒店的最大毛病。例如房間的空調不受住客控制，我和兒子的房间一直都是26-28度而我太太和女兒的房间卻是21度左右，所以再睡覺的時候我要把窗戶打開而我太太就要開電熱器（酒店把電熱器放在這個房間說明了空調有問題），這個情況我在杭州的索菲特也碰到過。此外我的浴室門每次開和關都發出啪啪的聲音，浴屏在洗澡後都有水漏出。最離譜的是有一個晚上十點多的時候我們兩個房間都没有熱水供應，我兒子洗澡洗到一半就只有溫水，我太太打電話過來也投訴沒有熱水了，她的房間溫度比較低所以冷的她發抖。

msg:不是很滿意的住宿，衝著酒店好歹是5星，不會太差的想法訂的，結果是5星的價格，3星的服務！
1、離地鐵站是真的遠，走路要累死
2、晚上熱水非常不穩定！！兩個晚上孩子洗澡都在裏面哇哇叫，等十來分鐘才會來熱水，水也不是很熱
3、這是我最想吐槽的一點，前台的工作人員，接觸了3個，無一例外，都很冷漠，辦理入住的時候，連早餐在哪裡都不告知！太不專業了！退房的時候，問從哪個電梯去停車場，問了三遍都都不回答，在低頭看手機！

我想説，如果是個別服務員的態度問題，也許是她個人問題，如果是普遍問題，酒店管理層是不是要反省下，有沒有做好相關要求與培訓！

環境：酒店老化了；
衞生：還行；
設施：房間空調失靈無法制熱；
服務：沒有服務感受；
總結：這個價位將就湊合吧，純情懷。
