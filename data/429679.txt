The location of the hotel is very good, only two kilometers away from the Wujiayu Sign Gate. You can see the beautiful scenery of Wulingyuan from the hotel. The only drawback is that there is no heater in the bathroom, so it is quite cold to take a shower in winter. In addition, children above 1.2 meters need to pay 30 yuan for breakfast, which will affect the experience. But the faults do not hide the advantages, overall it is quite good.

After arriving at the hotel, Nana, the customer service, greeted us at the door. One-stop service. If you don't find a tour guide in Zhangjiajie, you really can't understand it, so we chose Xiaodu, a tour guide. He explained carefully and patiently along the way, and chose the best routes for us. The main thing is that his photography skills are quite good, leaving us with a very precious souvenir of Zhangjiajie. He helped us choose a hotel and ordered a meal. We left after eating. It was delicious and hygienic. Jinbianxi is relatively long. Other tour guides walked one-third, but Xiaodu accompanied us for the whole journey, helped us carry things, took pictures, and was very considerate. The train back to Changsha was relatively tight, and Nana helped us put our luggage in the car and picked us up directly at the restaurant to go to the train station. The time was just right. All fares were cheaper than those on the Internet! All arrangements were properly arranged one after another, and it was worth the trip!

The room was upgraded to a suite. Thank you very much. The room is getting old and needs to be renovated. There is a shared clothes dryer in the room. It is quite convenient to wash clothes. The bed is also comfortable. The biggest penalty point is the shower head. There are very few water outlets on the head. The pressure is good but there is too little water. Washing your hair feels like watering flowers. In the middle of washing at night, the water will suddenly cut off and there will be water again. It is very strange! From noon to afternoon, the hot water at the sink has to be turned on for a very long time to warm up, and it is almost impossible to produce hot water.
The heating in the room can be very strong, but I would open the balcony door if I am afraid of the heat.
Nana from the tourism depar**ent can help arrange the itinerary. We used the pick-up and drop-off service several times this time. The drivers were great, but they were a bit more expensive. If you use Didi, it is very convenient and fast to call a taxi. The worst part is that when the occupancy rate of the hotel is low, the lights are basically not turned on in the lobby. It makes you wonder if you have entered the wrong place. It is a bit scary.

It was the first time I stayed in a hotel and I left the restaurant hungry. I didn't even have any saliva to drink, and I didn't even have a hard-boiled egg. The noodles have no toppings, and the white water noodles with pickles are tasteless. After checking out, I found that I had left toiletries in the room. I called the front desk and said that the cleaning lady didn't see it. Anything left behind at other hotels will be taken care of by the hotel. The only one who was satisfied was the doorman.

msg:This trip was very happy. From the hotel environment to the hotel's breakfast, including the waiters and the lobby manager, they were all very attentive. Then the hotel arranged a tour guide for An Tedi. The tour guide took care of us very carefully and was very special. The thoughtful, detailed explanation of each scenic spot also made us feel the spectacular beauty of Zhangjiajie and the natural scenic spot. Special thanks to the hotel manager and my tour guide. There is also the hotel tourism depar**ent, who will definitely introduce friends if they have the opportunity.

It takes five minutes to drive from the hotel to the sign gate. Very convenient. The hotel uses wooden floors, which are much cleaner than those carpets. There are not many reviews on Ctrip. Unlike some hotels that specialize in PR networks. And the parking lot is huge.

The second is that the small refrigerator in the guest room cannot be used, and it is very inconvenient to store food in summer.

msg:Transportation: The transportation is quite convenient, and it is quite close to the entrance of the scenic spot.

Hygiene: The hygiene is very poor. It was off-season when I went there. There were only a few employees working in such a large hotel. There was a pungent smell in the room. After reporting it to the front desk, I changed to another room, but it still had a pungent smell. The bathtub was covered with a layer of dust, and there were several dead flying insects. I slept on the bed for a night, and even if I was wearing clothes, I still felt itchy all over when I got up. I seriously suspected that I had not changed.
Environment: The external environment is not bad, there are many parking spaces, and many places inside the hotel have stopped operating, including the laundry room, resulting in the loss of many services in the hotel. Basically, except for the room, guests can't go anywhere. When I returned to the hotel at night, even except for the room where guests were staying, the lights in other places were turned off. It felt like staying in **. The places for eating, drinking and having fun around were also closed. I walked two kilometers without seeing any place to eat!
Service: The service is OK, although there are only a few people, you can still contact them
Summary: It is not worth the price at all, the service provided is not as good as the hotel that costs more than 100 yuan. If you want to save money in the off-season, then don't open it. If you open it, you can't provide the service you should have. It's really disgusting. It's a waste of money to come here to suffer!

msg:The hotel page states that it is close to the nucleic acid site, but it is actually more than 2 kilometers away, so walking is a bit awkward.
When we arrived at the hotel at 11:30 in the middle of the night, there was a young man at the front desk. While helping us check in, he answered the phone many times and required us to wait for him to finish processing and continue the process. Since Ctrip has a higher level, I asked if I could upgrade for free. I was told that because my stay was 3 days, which was too long, I couldn't be upgraded. There was no introduction to the hotel facilities or business hours, which caused us to miss breakfast the next day.
There was a musty smell when entering the room. The silicone on the bathroom wall had fallen off and was dark and dirty.
When we arrived at the restaurant at 9:31 the next morning, we were told that breakfast was over. They tried to persuade us to eat, but many dishes were gone. We had to admire the staff for clearing most of the dishes within one minute.
I went hiking and asked the front desk for 2 more bottles of water. I was told that there was no water at the front desk and I had to go back to the room to get it. A lady in a white shirt (suspected not to be a front desk employee, as all front desk employees are in black uniforms) sat at the front desk and told us about each room. Only 2 bottles of water, not much more. In the end, the housekeeping staff took it to the front desk.
When I returned to the hotel in the evening, the room still had a musty smell. When I went out in the morning, I took out the electricity card and turned on the air conditioner to remove the musty smell. When I came back, I turned it off. The energy saving of the hotel is not that bad!
Breakfast on the third day finally arrived before 9:30. The waiter in the restaurant said that our children over 140 would have to pay half price. Yes, we didn’t bring our mobile phones and agreed to hang them in the room bill. We were asked why we didn’t bring our mobile phones. Did you pay a deposit at the front desk? This kind of questioning is unacceptable. Whether or not I paid the deposit should be an internal management issue of the hotel. I should not be questioned. I feel extremely insulted by this and hope that the hotel can come forward to apologize to me!
There were many speechless situations that happened later, and I really don’t want to write about it. I originally went for the Jinjiang brand, thinking that at least the service and hardware would be guaranteed. Facts have proved that the thing that has made us miserable all our lives is,
I won’t come here again, it’s only suitable for groups, not individual travelers, please think twice! If there are 0 points, I will definitely give 0 points

msg:I went to the old five-star Jinjiang, but I was quite disappointed. The environment and building were of five-star standards, and the facilities and services were barely three stars. I originally booked a good B&B nearby, but due to the power outage, I looked for a five-star hotel that was closer and chose Jinjiang. An old five-star hotel. After arriving at the store, there was a pungent smell in the corridor. There was also a strong smell when entering the room. I don’t know if it was the smell of damp carpet or something, but it was like body odor. I had rhinitis after sleeping all night and it was uncomfortable. Very! Check out quickly and leave. The service is relatively poor and far from five-star. The breakfast is very poor and has very few varieties. The quality is very poor. The corn is not chewable. It feels not as good as Orange Crystal or All Seasons. I gave feedback to the receptionist at the door of the restaurant. The aunt said that I am only responsible for the quality of the dishes for which I collected money. It has nothing to do with me. She only keeps an eye on whether the child is too tall. The family of three in front of me said that the child is 1.31 meters tall (normally, if the child is under 1.3 meters, it is free). The aunt said that if the child is too tall, she will have to pay 30 yuan. Haha, I am speechless. Yes, my family is 1.5 meters tall, so of course I have to pay extra. In fact, most of the better hotels I stayed in during the epidemic basically did not require extra money for children. It feels impersonal and impersonal to demand that every centimeter of the food is so bad. It would be better to put some effort into improving hygiene, food quality, and service. A five-star hotel in a tourist city would not agree with this.

At 10:30 in the evening, when I called the front desk to deliver instant noodles, I just said that the store was closed. I called for takeout and it couldn't be delivered. I had to go down and get it myself. In other five-star hotels, robots can deliver takeout directly to the door of the room. I don't recommend it based on the overall review. Not as good as a fast hotel.

msg:酒店位置非常好，離景區門口十多分鐘的距離，入住體驗相當不錯，早餐品種多樣，前台服務人員態度一流，非常有親切感，酒店裡商旅部的胡經理也根據我們遊玩的天數免費幫我們制定了行程，也非常感謝酒店安排的導遊帶我們遊玩，服務周到、為人真誠，讓我避了很多坑，還有房間的設施和衞生都不錯，由於時間的關係，還有好多景點沒有遊玩，下次有機會來張家界一定還會選擇青和錦江。

msg:🚗 交通：離武陵源汽車站非常近，走路五分鐘就到，對於要坐車進市區或者坐車去火車站飛機場的小夥伴非常友好。去武陵源東門步行約15-20分鐘，沿路白鷺路、未央路都有很多吃早飯的地方，正好可以順路解決早飯。

🧹衞生：床鋪、衞生間和地面都非常乾淨。

🍃環境：非常安靜，晚上休息的非常好。這一點上強烈推薦給大家。酒店前面有較大一塊停車場，前面四周的馬路也是小馬路車輛較少，背後靠着居民小樓，晚上安靜沒有任何噪音。因為武陵源遊客較多，旅遊巴士也多，聽其他靠主要馬路的酒店住客有抱怨過噪音問題。
另外要表揚的是晚上空調也基本靜音，真的很難得。衹有在快早上的時候空調聲音變大，不知道為啥。

🔔服務：服務很好，剛入住的時候浴缸下水口壞了，打電話前台，一會五分鐘左右就有人帶着修理工過來，馬上就修好了。

要説不足就是酒店裝修看得出比較久了，有些損壞或者臟了，比如我們的電水壺就用不了，沙發套上有污漬，但我們也不用電水壺也沒有潔癖就也不重要。細節就是歡迎水果放很久了吧，看得出都快不是很新鮮了。總的來説瑕不掩瑜吧，主要是能休息的舒服很重要。
