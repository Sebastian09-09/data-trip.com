Excellent choice of food including freshly prepared local rice noodles provided at breakfast at this hotel considering its relatively small size. Our appreciation to Lucy & Jessie at the Reception who made our stay more enjoyable. Highly recimmended

The breakfast food is good, even though it is exactly the same every day. The rice noodles provided for breakfast are also very delicious. 

I would definitely come back again to this hotel if I come again to Guilin.

msg:Landscape context | Facing the highest peak in Guilin

The fog is so thick that it feels like traveling in a painting...
It is a commonplace to say that Guilin's landscape is the best in the world
But only when you are there can you understand that Chinese landscape painting is not abstract, but realistic

Before coming to Guilin, I had already decided to trace some of the best-preserved relics of the Ming and Qing dynasties
Jingjiang Palace and Museum, Sun and Moon Twin Towers, etc.
Of course, the landscape is stunning: Duxiu Peak and Elephant Trunk Hill are also long-awaited
Based on the several hotels I stayed in these days,
If you come to Guilin to play, you can give priority to: Zhengyang Pedestrian Street/Dongxixiang Business District

This trip is recommended: [Boyin Yi Nianjian] Hotel
There are mainly three reasons: good location + good aesthetics + good service

First of all, the good location is that it is located in the most prosperous business district in Guilin-Dongxixiang
You can see Jingjiang Palace & Duxiu Peak without leaving the hotel. When staying here, you can walk directly to the hotel in a few minutes
Save the road and greatly improve the travel experience

Good aesthetics is reflected in the overall environment of antique and modern integration
The overall room furnishings are bookish, ancient, calm, and the space is open and a**ospheric
At the same time, the room configuration is also very intelligent, very clever and attentive to integrate two points
Green plants and flowers are also integrated into the stay experience

The good service is mainly to tie my heart with delicious food
In short, the breakfast is really delicious! I would like to call it the top rice noodles in Guilin
After a short sleep in the morning, the breakfast that combines Chinese and Western cuisines completely awakened my good mood
In addition, the front desk has airport pick-up/high-speed rail pick-up services after reservation, and it is also very convenient for smart robots to help pick up takeout

One thought reveals the cultural context and one thought knows the mountains and rivers
The green mountains are far away and the nearby water is smoky
The perfect experience of this Guilin trip starts here~

You can't see the royal city on the roof...there is a wall outside the window, no scenery
Convenient for travel, next to the East-West Lane, and it is also convenient to eat around
The breakfast rice noodles taste very good, and the side dishes are also good
Suggestion: The small table for mobile phones in the toilet is a bit tilted, and the mobile phone is easy to fall when placed on it. It can be repaired!

The pool on the top floor has a great view of Guilin and rounded off the day perfectly for us. Another plus point is the possibility to wash your laundry for free and hang it up to dry in a separate room.
The breakfast was delicious and lovingly prepared.
The entire staff is extremely friendly and helpful. Lucy deserves special mention, who was friendly and committed to helping us plan our stay and any additional requests. She "saved" us several times, especially with language problems.
We would definitely book the hotel again if we returned to Guilin!!!

Boyin Yi Nianjian Hotel has a good location, just next to the East-West Lane, and it takes only a few minutes to go to Zhengyang Pedestrian Street opposite. It is so convenient to eat and drink! The main attractions in Guilin City, Elephant Trunk Hill, Sun and Moon Twin Towers, Two Rivers and Four Lakes, are not far away on foot. There are trees all the way, and you can reach it by walking along the Li River for more than ten minutes.
Double self-service afternoon tea: rich variety, snacks, cakes, coffee, drinks, fruits, especially passion fruit juice, rich and sweet!
Facilities: The hotel facilities are good, the decoration style is elegant and modern, the sanitary ware is Kohler brand, the mattress and pillow experience is particularly good, and friends have praised it unanimously!
Environment: Located in a busy urban area, surrounded by flowers, a little noisy at night!
Service: The service is nothing to say, the waiters in the store are warm and thoughtful, send the hotel location, popular attractions introduction, special food, and the recommendation is really not a pit! There are not many varieties of breakfast, but it is very exquisite, and both Chinese and Western food can be satisfied! Guilin rice noodles are also delicious!
We chose Boyin Yinianjian Hotel for this trip to Guilin. We are particularly picky about hotels, and we are all very satisfied with it. We will recommend it to friends for reference in the future!

msg:This trip to Guilin was a pleasant surprise for me. It was not as outrageous as what was said on the Internet. We stayed at Boyin for two nights, but we booked separately. The hotel staff was very considerate and sent us the specific location of the hotel in advance to inform us of the hotel services. The hotel is in a good location, less than 100 meters from Dongxi Lane, opposite Zhengyang Street, and 150 meters from Xiaoyao Tower, which is very convenient. When we arrived on the first day, the little brother asked us considerately if we needed two quilts. It was this sentence that completely captured my mother 😘 We were a group of three, one old and one child, and stayed in a king-size bed room. The room was very clean. My mother, who is a person with hygiene obsession, said she would stay here again next time. The second time we stayed, we contacted the little sister directly at night to book it. I said that the child wanted a tent, so they put the tent in the room for us. It was really considerate. Since it is the off-season now, the hotel said that breakfast would be delivered to our room according to the set meal. This wake-up service is perfect for a lazy person like me. Maybe the only drawback is that the hotel is not very big and there are not many rooms, but I think it's good. Before leaving, the children were given puzzles and gifts. 🎁 In short, I like it very much.

I heard from them that Guangxi is celebrating the March 3rd Festival these days, which is super lively.

The hotel takes a cultural route, the interior decoration is beautiful, the room space is sufficient, and the design is elegant. The hardware is very new, the only bad thing is that the electric plug has to be inserted with a lot of force! Special praise for the service. Early the next morning, a new hotel employee mistakenly thought my room was the entrance to the passage and kept banging on the door. After I reported it to the hotel, the hotel staff was very sincere. Not only did they come to apologize, but they also offered breakfast and upgraded my room. The hotel staff responded to the incident very professionally, which shows that the management level is very good.

The location of the hotel is very good. It is next to the East-West Lane. Jingjiang Palace is only about 3 minutes away. It is close to the pedestrian street. It takes 8 or 9 minutes to walk to Elephant Trunk Hill and Sun and Moon Twin Towers. It can be said that it is very convenient.
The hotel also has self-service washing machines, so you don’t have to worry about this problem.
Overall, this is the hotel I want to stay in most when I go on vacation. I will definitely book here again next time.

Opposite Xiaoyao Tower, you can take a walk along the Li River to Fubo Mountain. It is very convenient to eat, shop, take photos and check in along the way.
2. The front desk staff will take the initiative to help with luggage items and are very friendly.
3. There are not many types of breakfast, but it tastes good. Especially the ginseng fruit is so delicious!
4. The room is in a new Chinese style, neat and clean, with complete supporting facilities. I booked a double bed room, so there is no problem in sleeping two adults and one small bed. If you need anything, call the guest room center and a robot will bring it to you. Children especially like it!

The bedding is comfortable. The hotel restaurant may not look big, but it has a complete variety. Breakfast is no problem for staying for three or four consecutive days, and afternoon tea is not bad either! The only thing is that the room is not well lit. There are residential buildings in front and behind, and it is very crowded when the curtains are opened, but they provide a viewing platform on the seventh floor. It is nice to go up to take pictures and get some fresh air.

The back door leads to East and West Lane, Prince Jing’s Mansion, Xiaoyao Building, and across the street is the pedestrian street. It takes almost ten minutes to walk to the Sun and Moon Twin Towers. Five minutes to Elephant Trunk Hill! It's very convenient to go to various attractions while staying here, and there are many places to eat around. The room is big, the bed is big, and the Chinese-style decoration is very a**ospheric when checking in and taking photos. I like the tea table very much. There is a large observation deck and a small swimming pool on the seventh floor, which is suitable for taking photos and checking in. The whole house is smart and very nice. There is also a small robot that delivers food. The service is very good and considerate. The day before check-in, I contacted me to join the group to share the address and route. If I had any needs in the group two days after my stay, I was immediately responded to and solved! Their breakfast doesn't have many varieties, but everything tastes good. The rice noodles are more delicious than many restaurants. I like the dried fruits for afternoon tea (the snacks are average)

There is also a check-in area on the first floor specially set up for the New Year. It is really nice to knock on a big dragon. Just click and snap it and it will be very interesting!

When the weather is good, you can walk to Elephant Trunk Mountain, Sun and Moon Twin Towers, Jingjiang Palace, Duxiu Peak and other scenic spots from the hotel. The hotel also has a swimming pool, afternoon tea, and minibar. I will stay here again next time I come to Guilin. ! ! !

Service: Super good. The hotel has rice noodles for breakfast, which is better than nearby rice noodle shops. The robot delivers water and everything very quickly.
Fruits/snacks are welcome in the lobby, there is a buffet afternoon tea after 3 o'clock, and seasonal welcome fruits are all available in the guest rooms.
Finally, the elevator broke down the day before I left and it was slightly defective, but overall I was very satisfied👍. recommend

As long as you are willing to take a stroll, you can go anywhere on foot. It is very lively downstairs! The service staff are also very enthusiastic, and the breakfast is surprisingly delicious. It is made with care. At this price, it is no worse than a luxury hotel! When you have questions, the service staff are willing to answer them enthusiastically! It’s worthy of praise and repeat visits! Recommended for you to choose!

msg:The New Year decoration of Boyin·Yinianjian Hotel is so amazing! ! It's even more attentive than some photo studios, and you can save hundreds of money on photo shoots by staying in a hotel. If you are staying as a family, you can also take a New Year's family photo here. It won't be too popular if you post it in your circle of friends!
Boyin is definitely my true love. This is my fourth time staying there, and I have also experienced it in other branch brands of the group. The room layout of Yi Nianjian is reasonable, and the bedding, bathroom, soundproofing, and other aspects are very stable and reliable (I have just come back from staying in a B&B in Yangshuo and I understand this deeply). The details of the bathroom alone make people feel better. The emergency phone next to the smart toilet is not a handset, but two switch panels: front desk | SOS. The supplies in the shower room are still appelles👍🏻 It can be seen that the boss is very professional in the hotel business.
Breakfast and afternoon tea are carefully prepared, with local Guilin rice noodles and mung bean paste with restrained sweetness. I also had the best sugar orange this year in Boyin🍊🍊I even took away two of them before checking out.
A good hotel can be the icing on the cake for a trip. Whether you are traveling with family👨👩👦friends👭couples👫, the stay experience in Boyin·Yinianjian is extremely comfortable, just choose it with your eyes closed!

The lady at the front desk was very helpful and recommended a lot of delicious food near the hotel. It was very authentic. We even went to several restaurants two or three times because they were so delicious. In addition, this hotel has its own parking lot, which is more friendly to self-driving. It is very close to the pedestrian street and the Royal City. It is very convenient for walking around. A slight drawback is that the air conditioner can be a bit noisy when the wind is at its lowest, but the flaws are not concealed, and the overall stay feels good. Very satisfied!

I read the reviews and said that the breakfast rice noodles are delicious. After trying it myself, it is indeed good! Highly recommended ~ but the service doesn't seem to be as good as other reviews say. Maybe I'm thinking too much, but the service is still very normal. Overall, it's good. I'm willing to recommend it to other friends and will choose it again next time.

We went on a group tour at 7 o'clock the next day. The lady at the front desk notified the kitchen in advance to ensure that we could get a packaged warm breakfast directly when we left. It was rich in variety, nutritionally balanced, and full-service. We will definitely come next time Come again.

It's only a ten-minute drive from Guilin High-speed Railway Station and is located in the city center. The room was clean and spacious. The breakfast is rich and delicious, and there is free afternoon tea. The ladies and brothers at the front desk are very nice and polite. Special thanks to the cleaning lady Xie, who is happy to help and makes the guests feel warm. Thank you!

Just turn the corner and cross the road to Zhengyang Road Pedestrian Street. It is very convenient to walk to Xiangshan Park in 15 minutes. The front desk service was also very enthusiastic and helped to book tickets for Two Rivers and Four Lakes. The hotel also provides free afternoon tea and snacks. The only drawback is that the window is relatively close to the opposite building and there is no view. Fortunately, there is an observation deck and swimming pool on the top floor.

The location is very good, next to the East and West Alley, which is very lively, but the room is very quiet, which is the type of quietness amidst the hustle and bustle. There is no view outside the window. The best view is from the city view room. Breakfast in the morning was okay, and afternoon tea was also available in the afternoon. I was given a souvenir when checking out. It’s great to have robots that can deliver food. The girls at the front desk were very nice and friendly. They studied the Guilin itinerary together and gave very reasonable suggestions. The hotel helped us book a chartered car to go to the rice terraces. The driver had a problem, and the hotel also helped to solve it properly. The whole stay experience was very good.

I learned that we are traveling by car, because the hotel is located in the very center of the city, and there is a section of the road that needs to be borrowed from a non-motorized vehicle to enter the hotel! The hotel lady contacted me on the first day of check-in and sent me a location navigation video! Very considerate! Like it 👍! The main reason for my wife to book this hotel is convenience. She said it is close to the East and West Ancient Alleys, so it is convenient for shopping and eating! The location is really good! Behind the hotel is the East and West Ancient Alley, you can enter and exit by swiping the card from the back door of the hotel! It is also very close to the Elephant Trunk Mountain Scenic Area, it takes only ten minutes to walk there! The hotel is very chic! The room is big and clean, all the drinks in the minibar are free, and there is also free afternoon tea! My wife really likes their laundry room, and there are tatami mats in the room! My daughter loves to sleep on the tatami at night! The young lady and brother at the front desk of the hotel are very enthusiastic! The service details are all in place! Like here 👍! Although the breakfast is simple, the Guilin rice noodles are still good! The parking lot is a bit small though! But it is still able to satisfy the parking of vehicles for self-driving tours! Next time I have a chance, I will continue to stay!

A paradise hidden away in the city, flowers bloom in a moment of silence

It happened to be a light rain in Guilin on the day I checked in.
Climb to the observation deck on the 7th floor and feel the hazy mist
Listening to the sound of rain is like a slowly unfolding ink painting
Go to Jingjiang Prince's Mansion to see the history of previous dynasties. Go to Elephant Trunk Hill to experience the history of Guilin.
At night, enjoy the night view along the embankments of the two rivers and four lakes
The East-West Alley is always brightly lit🏮
Encounter the thousands-year-old city walls of old Guilin
Stay in the Park Yin Yi Nian Room in the alley
The infinity swimming pool here overlooks the fireworks of the East and West Alleys
Enjoy life like a prince or general in your free time
The green mountains and rivers are hidden, suddenly like a dream

After exiting the hotel through an underground passage, you will reach the Li River. You can go down the stairs and go fishing and diving along the river. It is very relaxing. You can take a leisurely stroll with the cool river breeze. There are not many types of afternoon tea in the hotel. Breakfast is a standard Chinese and Western breakfast. The waiter is very kind and provides welcome fruits and afternoon tea. He also gave a souvenir when checking out. My pictures were taken with the original camera for your reference.

The hotel room is nothing to say. Although it is in a busy city, it is very quiet, clean and tidy, and parking is available. After making a reservation, the beautiful woman at the front desk will proactively contact you and send you a parking diagram, which is very considerate. After all, it is a downtown area, and every inch of land is valuable, so it is very friendly to self-driving tourists.
In addition, I would like to praise the hotel’s breakfast rice noodles, which are so delicious! ! For his rice noodles, I have to stay in Poyin for a while!

The swimming pool on the roof has a nice view, but unfortunately it was a bit cold on the day we went. I would like to make a point for improvement. Although the check-in fruit was presented as a gift out of politeness, I would like it to be delivered to the room before check-in, or when the room is occupied. Now that I have checked in, I left the room with everything spread out by default For the time being, it’s just for my personal use. Even delivering fruit makes guests feel like trespassing. Of course, this is just a personal suggestion. It would be even better if you can add some parent-child or children’s toiletries

There will be staff reminding you to eat afternoon tea and bring it to the room when you check in, and you can consult the housekeeper at any time. There are not too many options for afternoon tea and breakfast, but they are enough. You need to swipe your card to enter the back door from Dongxi Lane. It’s really convenient to get to the city’s scenic spots and several online celebrity restaurants, and several of them can be reached on foot. You can save travel time by eating, drinking, and playing. The facilities and services are in place, and the service content of the staff is not only proactive, but also generous. The hotel also has robots participating in the service, which is very good. It would be even better if the balcony on the roof could be bigger and higher! In addition, when the sink is used for water, it is easy to splash some water to the edge of the pool, and the others are really great! Very recommended to stay! Glad I chose this one before leaving!

The suite that 736 stayed in was 80 square meters and was super new. Why do the comments below the Grand Mansion say that the facilities are old? What the hell is this called obsolete? How is Gagaxin? Interfered with my options and made me choose an expensive and expensive Internet celebrity B&B?

msg:All kinds of facilities can satisfy traveling with children. When taking the baby out to play, Housekeeper Hai helps with washing and drying the clothes. Going to catch the boat early in the morning, the housekeeper thoughtfully prepared the breakfast for me and my baby and put it at the front desk, and it can be taken away directly when we go out.

The afternoon buffet for two is also very rich. The sweet-scented osmanthus black tea in the lobby is delicious. I always pack a thermos to take away when I go out every day.

The hotel is clean, comfortable and warm, it feels like home. The location is quiet in a prosperous place, the back door leads directly to the East and West Alleys, but it is not noisy.

It takes 3 minutes to walk to the Lijiang River, and 12 minutes to walk to Elephant Trunk Hill Park and the Two Rivers and Four Lakes Cruise Terminal. You can take a walk back to the hotel after taking the cruise at night. It's a 5-minute walk from Xiaoyao Building. The back door of the hotel is Dongxi Lane. It takes 8 minutes to walk to the ancient city wall and Jingjiang Palace. It's very convenient to go anywhere. The hotel also provides afternoon tea every day. The swimming pool on the roof is small but has a good view. The rooms are new and spacious. The service and attitude of the staff are very good. A hotel recommended by the cracked wall.

The hotel housekeeper sent a message in advance to tell the car entry route to dispel the concerns of the driver. When checking in at the front desk, the staff were warm and polite. Entering the room is as advertised in the hotel pictures. The room is spacious and bright, with complete facilities, electric curtains, USB charging ports, and robots delivering food to the room. Of course, there are small shortcomings, such as wall power sockets It is very difficult to use, and the sound of the air conditioner is slightly noisy as described by the store. The hotel breakfast is simple but enough for guests to choose, and the rice noodles taste really good! The hotel does not have its own restaurant, but we went to the cloud restaurant of Boyin Hotel, where the scenery is beautiful and the food tastes very good! The location of the hotel is superior, and there is the East and West Alley after we go out. This is what we found out after walking many times. In fact, the front desk can tell us in advance, which will make us feel more considerate. We stayed for five nights in total, (booked for four nights and then stayed for one night). To be honest, I really feel good. I am willing to write so many reviews and hope that more friends can stay and experience it. Not only is it very close to East and West Alleys, but you can also walk to King Jing’s Mansion, Elephant Trunk Hill, and the Twin Towers. If you avoid the hot weather in July, it will be even better! The balcony on the top floor can see the mountain view from a distance, and there is also a small rooftop for washing and drying clothes, which is very practical! The staff who clean the room are also very polite. There was a little noise in the room at night, and the front desk staff actively resolved it. Attitude is everything. Even if there is a problem, we can understand each other! In short, this stay is like going home!

After check-in, there is a self-service afternoon tea in the lobby, and there are a variety of types, as well as a variety of scented teas

the
room facilities
When I got to the room, I found that the real thing is more beautiful than the pictures on the Internet. The room is spacious, and I can feel that the sanitation is in place.
There is also a set of baby sleeping products from the small submarine column on the tatami, which has a comfortable and fragrant smell
There is also a baby pedal on the side of the washbasin, and there is a Pigeon bath set and a special baby wash set beside the washbasin
What the baby looks forward to most when staying in a hotel is the bathtub. The shape of the bathtub is really good for taking a bath.
After taking a bath, there is a special baby bathrobe. When holding the baby, I found that the bathrobe also has a faint fragrance, which is the kind of smell that is very clean after washing and drying.
TV resolution is very high, watching cartoons is very comfortable
Tatami and kung fu tea set are good
There is also a capsule coffee machine
The overall decoration and furniture are very textured

the
geographic location
In the evening, my husband coaxed the baby to sleep. I said I wanted to go out for a walk in Dongxi Alley. I asked the front desk how to get there. He guided me to walk through the back door of the hotel and told me that going out the back door was Dongxi Alley.
I'm shocked
East-West Alley at night is really easy to stroll around, and it feels safe to live close by. I didn’t walk back to the hotel until twelve o’clock
the
breakfast buffet
This hotel is not a very big hotel, but I was pleasantly surprised by the attentiveness of the breakfast buffet
Guilin rice noodles are very authentic. The hotels here serve Guilin rice noodles every morning.
The soy milk is delicious, and the taste of Chinese food is also good. Every dish is carefully cooked.

When we arrived at the lobby, the young ladies all dressed comfortably, spoke kindly, and walked gracefully. The room layout is reasonable and the facilities are very new. Open the window and you can see Duxiu Peak, the "No. 1 mountain in Guilin". There are washing machines on the top floor for washing and drying. The infinity pool is slightly small, but the children had a great time. Because I am used to ordering breakfast, so when I arrived, there were not many varieties. The young lady ordered two bowls of rice noodles, which were very delicious. The minibar in the room is all free. The complimentary afternoon tea is rich in variety, including fruits, drinks, desserts, and any taste. Because there is no need to pick up the airport, the hotel provides a drop-off service. The little brother has worked hard to carry the huge box into the car.

msg:I took my baby to this hotel during the summer vacation. The picture shows that the location of this hotel is good and the online reviews are high. The feeling after check-in is indeed the same, the hotel as a whole is great! Especially after visiting the business, cultural and creative, Jingjiang Wangfu, restaurants, and Internet celebrity shops in the surrounding East and West Alleys, it feels even more so. There are dense businesses here, and every inch of land is very expensive. And Jane's first impression.
From the name to the furnishings of the hotel, the word "hidden" is highlighted, creating a sense of tranquility and a touch of Zen.
There is a bookstore on the side of the hotel, next to the statue of the sage, it can be directly connected to the East-West Alley and Wenchuang Street, which is very convenient.
We booked a twin room, the room is more than 30 square meters, clean, tidy, details are in place, there is a capsule coffee machine, welcome fruit. When checking in in the afternoon, there is afternoon tea in the lobby, which is quite rich in content. I like lychee tremella soup, which is light and sweet and moist, very comfortable.
The twin beds in the room are definitely the highlight, with a width of 1.5 meters. It is very practical to bring a baby out. The mattress is also comfortable. It has a moderate soft drink and a good support. The quilts have also been replaced with summer quilts. I really like it. The quality of the toiletries is also very good!
The staff are polite, kind, and have a good attitude. It should be said that they are responsive. There was an aunt at breakfast who was very kind. She offered to tell us that we could order freshly made Guilin rice noodles first, and served them herself. I didn’t see fried eggs on the dining table. After I ordered them, she brought them over immediately. It’s really heartwarming, thank you!
The only regret is that the exterior view of the room is a bit bad. Outside the window, it should be the roof of the building next door. The tiles are flying around and it is very messy, which affects the experience of staying. We simply closed the curtains. In addition, there is a small swimming pool on the top floor, about 4m*4m in size. The picture promotion is a bit distorted, like a large infinity pool.

After enjoying the afternoon tea at the hotel, it was such a beautiful view that I borrowed a set of Hanfu at the front desk to take a picture on a whim. There is a 24-hour bookstore at the exit of the back door. While the children are taking a nap, the old mother can enjoy a moment of leisure. The infinity swimming pool on the top floor can be used to discharge children. Overlooking the Duxiu Peak and the row upon row of brick and tile houses in the Wangfu, the mood suddenly becomes brighter. In the evening, go to the nearby East and West Lane for dinner and take a walk in Jingjiang Wangfu. The rhythm slows down, relaxing and leisurely. The service from the lady at the front desk is really nice, the room is very soundproof, and you can make tea on the tatami mat, so comfortable!

Downstairs is Dongxiang Alley and Jingjiang Royal City, opposite is Zhengyang Road Pedestrian Street, and then it only takes about ten minutes to walk to Elephant Trunk Hill. Along the way is the Li River, very central location. It's very convenient for eating and playing; secondly, the decoration of the hotel is very beautiful and new, the whole is Chinese style, clean and very a**ospheric, and the room is quite big; thirdly, the attitude of the staff is very good, and they saw the three of us , but the room comes with double breakfast, so an extra breakfast and toiletries in the room are provided for free. The drinks and fruits in the room are also free. I asked the front desk about the surrounding activities, and they patiently introduced them. As I was really satisfied with all the above, I originally planned to stay for one day to try it out, but ended up staying for four days😎Highly recommended~

The bathtub 🛀 is hygienic and clean, and there is no hair at all, and the oversized tatami in the room is also amazing to me, lying on it seems to forget all the troubles 👀.

Having said all this, I haven’t mentioned what I think is the biggest advantage of this hotel, the location! The hotel is very close to Dongxixiang, Zhengyang Pedestrian Street, and Jingjiang Prince's Palace, which saves tourists a lot of transportation time.

At night, you can go shopping in Dongxi Lane and eat whatever you like. It takes only 7 minutes to ride a bicycle to Xiangbishan Park.

Check-in is also very smooth and convenient. The room is not big, and there is no view from the window, but the design is very textured, and the sanitation is satisfactory, especially in terms of service! Every time you enter, you will take the initiative to say hello, free mini bar, free disposable bath bags, free afternoon tea and buffet breakfast, and the whole family is very satisfied.
The most rare thing is that even if there is a traffic jam after check-out, if you call the hotel when you really don’t know who to ask for help, the staff will come over to help you out immediately, without even having time to ask for the name. Thank you so much! ! !
A place with peace of mind is home, and Boyin's first-class service makes our family feel at home, very down-to-earth and warm! Thanks again for letting us have a wonderful trip memory!

Let me talk about the bad: the location of the twin room is very bad, facing the toilet in the opposite building, the boss said it was like this, and then it was embarrassing that as soon as we opened the curtains, we saw a boy on the opposite side washing his hands after going to the toilet …It's awkward for us two girls to face each other, mainly because we are so close! In the end, my parents let us sleep in their room, which is the one on the picture, and they changed to a big bed room upstairs, without tatami! relatively small
Let me tell you about the overall feeling; the breakfast is quite satisfactory, rice noodles and fruit are ok, there is afternoon tea, tremella soup, mung bean soup, and fruit, the sound insulation effect of the room is very good, +100 points for a key insomnia sufferer like me!
The hotel is located in East and West Lane. It doesn't look big, but it is very convenient to go everywhere. It is next to Prince Jing's Mansion. You can go to Sun Moon Tower and Elephant Trunk Hill without taking a taxi! It is very comfortable to walk along Binjiang Road by the river!
Overall very satisfied! The price is slightly expensive, probably because of March 3

However, the check-out service feels much worse. There are also a lot of luggage. The front desk is not busy, but it is just looking at the mobile phone, and there is no help.

I also found this hotel on the recommendation of Xiaohongshu. After checking the location, it was very good. It is in the city center and very close to Dongxixiang and Elephant Trunk Hill! The key point is that the service is very good. I called to tell the exact location before arriving. In fact, I booked this for my husband. He is a very picky person. He said you should go and give a good review. I said are you sure your stay is good? He said that the accommodation was very good, hahahahaha, so he gave it a five-star rating.

The room we live in is the cheapest one, the floor is not high, the window has no view, only the wall, and my son named it: wall view room. But when you come to Guilin, you must go out to see the scenery. It is very late to return to the hotel every day. The real purpose is to take a bath and sleep on comfortable bedding.

The service staff helped us to the room, and they also pushed the luggage. The air conditioner is turned on in advance when entering the door, and the toilet is heated. How touching is it to have a heated toilet this season? I was on the verge of tears and the room was fine. It is also very convenient to go shopping in Dongxi Lane in the back. The sound insulation of the room is very good, and I had a comfortable sleep. Everyone is very kind. I will stay there again when I go to Guilin again.

The location is really good.

msg:The location of the hotel is very good, the room is very tidy, the layout is beautiful, the service staff is also very nice, warm and polite. The reason for giving three points is for the short-haired female foreman with a very bad attitude. When we arrived on the first day, it was stated that we were a family of three, and the breakfast included two. We made up the breakfast fee for two days for the child, which was 59 yuan a day. At that time, we took the initiative to ask how much to make up for the afternoon tea. The service staff said that there is no need to make up for the child. You can enjoy it for free. But when we came back to the hotel the next afternoon, I had a bad cough because I had recovered from my yang, so I went to the front desk and said that I needed a small bag of tea, so I could drink some hot tea to make me feel better. This short-haired female foreman is very bad She said, no, a small pack costs 28 yuan. I said we don’t need drinks and snacks, can we change them? She said that if you don’t drink, you can take them away, and she also said that only two bottles of water are provided every day, but the front desk clearly told us on the first day that there is not enough water and it is free. Provided, seeing her bad attitude, I asked, let's go to have afternoon tea, she shouted loudly, there were only two copies, our whole family was very embarrassed at that time, the child was very angry, maybe the waiter reminded her, she immediately returned Shout out, eat, eat, it made us beggars, if it wasn't for the severe cough, I really wanted to burst out at her, the most ridiculous female foreman with short hair on the line, we didn't move drinks and snacks on the first day, No delivery on the second day. It’s funny. I was really angry at night. I called the front desk. The front desk was very nice and brought tea bags and water. But I really want to complain about the short-haired female foreman. One more day, we also chose other hotels. From now on, we will not stay in any hotels under Bo Yin's banner again, and spend money to find comfort! ! ! !

The tea leaves on the tea table are old tea, and the scenery outside the tea table is a messy residential building. The room is said to have a yard, but it is actually just a cramped patio, with only a few simple artificial landscapes of bamboo for decoration, traffic flow and residential buildings. The sound of fans and other sounds is constant day and night, so it is basically impossible to stay in the yard. The attitude of the service staff is very good.

It is within 1 km from Elephant Trunk Hill, Two Rivers and Four Lakes, and Qixing Park, which can be reached by walking. I like the facilities and environment of the hotel very much, Chinese decoration style, very high-end a**osphere. The service attitude of the hotel staff is very friendly and warm, and the aunt cleans the room very clean. With such a good service experience, the price of the hotel is very affordable, which is completely close to the people. I highly recommend everyone to travel to Guilin and stay in this hotel!

In addition, can you imagine that the hotels near the scenic spot actually park for free? Unbelievable, self-driving tours really make money

Stayed at this hotel last week
It was past 10pm when we checked in
Miss sister personally delivered from the front desk to the room
When I entered the room, I was very attentive and helped to plug in the electricity and turn on the lights.
Briefly describe the layout of the room
Shower and toilet are separated
I like this design
The top spray bath with water from the wall is so comfortable
The toilet also comes with a smart cover
experience upup up
The oversized bed is very comfortable to lie on
sleep till dawn
What's even more amazing is that the switch settings in the room have many modes
Curtains are also electric
There is also a place to drink tea
At breakfast in the morning, the lady at the front desk will ask if I want a bowl of Guilin rice noodles
When it's done, it'll be delivered straight to your table
The overall experience is very good
The service from start to finish made me feel it was worth it
The hotel is in the east and west lanes
After eating, you can go to Dongxixiang for a walk
Next time you travel, you must stay a few more days

Thanks to Ctrip for solving the problem and the hotel for its help. The hotel is located in the city center, which is convenient to travel. The breakfast has two kinds of packages, Chinese and Western. In order to reduce contact, the food is delivered to the room, and the quality is quite exquisite. There is a laundry room on the roof, an infinity swimming pool, and a garden overlooking the city of Guilin. Because the broken arm has not healed, the cleaners will open the bottle cap for me every time they deliver water and ask if there is anything else they can do for me. The front desk is even more considerate to provide a food punch-in place, so that my anxiety can be filled with food. These thoughtful and considerate services really touched me!

I only write here some good things that may not be reflected in the pictures. Every design of the hotel room is very good. Attentive and fully in accordance with the configuration of the high-end hotel, such as the wardrobe at the door, the safe, bathrobe and umbrella, and 4 pairs of disposable slippers, two pairs are in the shoe cabinet, two pairs are in the slipper bag of the wardrobe, and the bathroom area is open. Yes, it is equipped with two vanity mirrors with lights, two people wash without fighting, and there is a full-length mirror opposite. The biggest highlight is the huge tatami, with a coffee table and cushions on it, you can lie down or sit, and you can put your luggage. In addition, there is an extra-long storage table. No matter how much luggage two people bring, it will not appear cluttered in the room. Another small highlight is the coffee machine, which is the dolcegusto version of the capsule, which is very delicious. The entire minibar area is also very convenient to use, and fresh fruit will be delivered at night.
Speaking of public facilities, the entire floor is very quiet. When we checked in, the room was full. There was no noise from the corridors of the room. The swimming pool was on the top floor. Just don't be too comfortable
For breakfast, Guilin rice noodles are delicious, the fruit is fresh, and there is yogurt to drink
In short, I love this hotel so much, even if it is the price of the 11th Golden Week, it is a value-for-money experience.

Free Mini Bar in the room: all the drinks in it are free and they will be refilled after drinking

The afternoon tea set is a pity, I don't know what it's like to be outside every afternoon

After breaking out some old shops outside, the real five-point Guilin rice noodles are in the hotel. This is the evaluation after eating a few outside. Two bowls must be eaten every morning. The swimming pool on the top floor of the hotel is good, but it is a pity that I did not bring a swimsuit. It coincides with the Mid-Autumn Festival and there is a hotel party, so a lot of snacks are prepared. It is very comfortable to sit on the sofa on the top floor and blow the hair dryer. In addition, some living facilities are also complete. In short, this hotel is very pleasant, and I will definitely choose it when I come to Guilin.

In general, Poyin is ok.
Bonus items: The ancient style is strong in color, the style is obvious, and the hygiene is also done well. It's quiet and clean when you go in. The location of the hotel is good. The next door to the book gallery is the East-West Alley. A little further, you can walk to Jiefang Bridge, Elephant Trunk Hill and Sun and Moon Pagoda. The breakfast was packed for us because we were in a hurry. The free afternoon tea is a feature, the taste is average but the pictures are good. It is also good to provide a free airport pick-up service.
Deductions: The bathroom has a little odor. When the mattress is turned over, I can feel the springs. The front of the hotel is really stretched, and it is crowded among a bunch of messy houses. If you don't pay attention, you don't even know that this is a hotel. When you open the curtains in the room, the view is very messy, and there will be a gap compared with the hotel's promotional photos. The front desk is wearing a beautiful cheongsam and sneakers on her feet...

msg:It's a pleasant surprise to stay at the Poyin One Thought Hotel! After checking out of the last hotel in the morning, I came directly by car. I originally planned to store the large luggage at the front desk, and then went out to play until 2 o'clock in the afternoon and then came back to check in. I didn't expect to arrive at 9 o'clock in the morning, and there was a room.
The room I booked is only this green courtyard suite, which is very large and has a sky courtyard. The room facilities are exquisite, the bathroom is so wet and separated, the sanitary ware is all Kohler, and the toilet is actually a smart toilet seat! There is also a freestanding bathtub. There is an open-air swimming pool on the top floor of the seventh floor, where you can enjoy the beauty of the Solitary Beauty Peak. The buffet breakfast provided by the hotel does not have many varieties, but it is exquisitely done and tastes very good. The service staff are all polite and attentive. Gives a feeling of being at home. The hotel is located in the center of Guilin City, next to Dongxi Lane, Jingjiang Palace and Duxiu Peak. Next time I come to Guilin, I hope to stay in this hotel again.

We stayed in the King's Mansion Landscape King Room. The room is very spacious and bright, and the interior is full of Chinese-style decoration. Separate from the bathing area, clean and hygienic.
Outside the window of the room is the brick eaves of the east and west lanes, which is very quiet, especially the scenery on the roof is amazing. You can see the Solitary Beauty Peak. When the drizzle is drizzling, the mountains in the distance are surrounded by fog, and the misty rain Guilin is picturesque.
The hotel's buffet breakfast is also good, as well as freshly cooked Guilin rice noodles. The overall stay experience is very good👌

There is also a most beautiful bookstore next to the first floor. It has a strong fragrance of books. I don’t want to go shopping in Dongxixiang at night. I just sit in the bookstore and put down my mobile phone to read a book and enjoy the time alone with myself. In short, this experience is full of marks💯

Half of the price of more than 400 yuan is IQ tax, which is actually a budget hotel. If you choose a good name and spend money to get a ranking on Ctrip, the unit price can be doubled! The Gangshe Hotel a few hundred meters away only costs over 200 yuan! Please don’t pay IQ tax like me, just this once! Ctrip sucks, don’t believe Ctrip’s so-called rankings anymore!

I opened the curtains and wanted to see the street or scenery in the distance, but when I saw the residential building opposite, it was only four or five meters away, and it collapsed instantly. The breakfast is relatively simple and delivered to the room. It is not worth more than 300 yuan in the off-season for tourism. At this price, you can live in the Grand Residence.

[Room] The store upgraded the Royal Palace View Room. The moment the door opened, I was overjoyed. I like the decoration style of the room. The most intimate thing is that the bathtub is equipped with a disposable bath set! There are not many big hotels! Finally you can take a bath without spending time in the bathtub. Happy! ! ! I also gave fruit, praise!

The last is breakfast. I didn’t expect the large portion to be so affordable. I accidentally ordered a bit too much hahaha~ The taste is not bad. The best thing is that the aunt delivered to the room on time. She was also very polite and very good. I must like it~

The only thing that is not so good is that the central air-conditioning fan is a bit too loud~

It's not a trust, I just think this hotel is better than the old luxury hotels~ I will come next time on business trip hahaha~

msg:The services and facilities of Japanese boutique hotels are small and complete. The staff are very enthusiastic. They contacted me one day in advance, added WeChat and posted a road map. Going out from the back door of the hotel is Dongxi Lane, which is very convenient for eating and drinking. The food is not tasty and needs improvement. For me, who is sensitive to light, the light coming in through the blinds of the shower room in the morning can shine through the window behind the bed and affect my sleep.

msg:Passing through Guilin, I wanted to find a store to rest for a night. I saw this hotel hidden in the city on Ctrip. It was next to the East and West Alleys. The room was very satisfied. Although there are not many varieties of breakfast, there are basically what you should have, and the taste is good. I especially like the bedding. It is really comfortable. I have stayed in many hotels. The quilt in this hotel is the most comfortable, just like the one used at home. Like the quilt, I will definitely stay here next time I come to Guilin!

It takes only a few minutes to walk to the palace, so people who drive by themselves are not recommended because the hotel parking spaces are very tight! The decoration of the hotel is very style, the rooms are large, and the service is very warm. There are breakfast and free afternoon tea. For free, it tastes passable!

msg:The first hotel I visited in Guilin during the National Day was set temporarily. I was thinking about staying for one night and going to Yangshuo the next day. I didn't expect to be amazed by this Chinese style hotel, and the Chinese style was so beautiful!

Hotel rooms and facilities ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
The hardware settings are very good (various touch mirror lights, etc.), the room is large, there are a variety of free drinks in the small refrigerator, and a hand coffee machine. The tatami tea seat is very unique (especially suitable for taking pictures! Especially suitable for taking pictures! Especially suitable for taking pictures!) important things are told three times haha~
Special thanks to the thoughtful gifts for children (new pigeon shower gel, children's slippers, toothbrush sets, etc.). Few hotels will provide children's slippers, which is really thoughtful~~

Hotel Service ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
The service is really five-star praise. Before leaving, I added WeChat to inform the detailed route and positioning. Because there was no parking space, we were allowed to park next door and reimbursed the parking fee. The little gg at the front desk helped to upgrade the room. When checking out, the young lady at the front desk also gave a small tea as a souvenir. The overall service is really five-star praise.

Hotel location and surroundings ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
The hotel is located in Dongxixiang Scenic Area, quiet in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by Wangjiang Pavilion, Qixingyan Scenic Area, Two Rivers and Four Lakes Scenic Area, and a 10-minute walk from Zhengyang Road Pedestrian Street and Jingjiang Palace.
Transportation: It is just downstairs from Dongxixiang, Duxiu Peak and Xiaoyao Building, and the location is convenient.
The first floor of the hotel is especially suitable for taking pictures. There is a dining table with a bamboo forest background, and there is an area where you can sit and drink tea with guzheng hanging. It is also especially suitable for taking pictures. It is antique and elegant.

🐷Special reminder🐷
The hotel is located next to the East and West Alleys, it is only a minute’s walk away, but the entrance of the hotel is not obvious. Students who drive by themselves must be very careful. ...Specially remind everyone).

It's a pity that I didn't go to the infinity pool on the top floor of the hotel, so let me regret it and come again next time :)

msg:I am very happy to stay at the Boyin Yinian Hotel. As the last stop of the Guilin trip, the hotel really gave me a good experience.
🚗 Transportation: The location of the hotel is very good, backed by Dongxi Alley, located in the city center, not far from every attraction, it is very convenient to eat and play. And the most important point is that although the hotel is located in the east and west lanes, it is quite quiet, which is very rare.
🧹Sanitation: The sanitation is quite clean, not only in the guest rooms, but also in the public areas, so you can live with peace of mind.
🍃Environment: I stayed in a courtyard room, a typical new Chinese style, with complete supporting facilities and complete facilities. The room type actually comes with an outdoor courtyard in the sky. The design is very special. And the details are quite in place, including the plastic bag in the paper bag and the laundry basket. The details are really taken care of. There are not many styles of breakfast, but the food is very comfortable. The five-star certification and positioning are well deserved. The view may not be very open due to the location, but the city view on the top of the building is not bad either
🔔Service: The attitude of the lady at the front desk is very good, which makes you feel like going home. By the way, I am also very happy to be upgraded to the room type. The younger brother at the front desk will also take the initiative to help with luggage and lead to the room and introduce the facilities. The service standard is even OK. Comparing to the luxury five-star standard. Responsive, very comfortable.
Overall, it is definitely worthy of Ctrip's 4.9 rating. Guilin's top hotel also gives some suggestions to the hotel. First, it is best to put an extra trash can in the room. A trash can in the bathroom is a little bit insufficient. Second, it is recommended to spread mats on the ground between the tiles and the floor. The hotel slippers will slip a little when stepping on the tiles. Fortunately, we young people are afraid that the old people’s legs and feet will easily fall. In short, when I come back to Guilin, Boyin is still the first choice, and I hope the hotel business is prosperous.

The layout of the hotel is also very elegant, and it mirrors the east and west lanes. There is a thoughtful afternoon tea every afternoon.
There is a swimming pool on the top floor, and the scenery is also very good. The only thing that needs improvement is whether the water temperature control in the pool can be considered. The hotel stayed last week, the outdoor temperature is also 33-35 degrees, but children and adults think it is very It's cold. Recently, the children were so cold that their lips turned purple and had to leave the pool.

The hotel is very new, all facilities are very good, the family room is big enough, and there are tents and tatami mats that children love very much. The hotel service is very good and makes people feel at home. The scenery on the 7th floor is absolutely unique, and there is also a small infinity pool with few people. After two days, it is a basic charter. The location of the hotel is also quite good, downstairs is the Twelve O'clock Bookstore, and passing through the bookstore is the lively East-West Alley. There is a big shopping mall on the opposite side of the road, and there are various food streets around it. Very close to various attractions. The only drawback is that parking is not allowed on the road in front of the hotel, even if taxis are not allowed. Every time a taxi is parked at the intersection, it is not convenient to bring the elderly and children.

The low-key luxury and connotation are definitely worthy of the hotel’s hardware facilities. I admire and admire the boss’s unique vision and taste, and the careful materials used in various details reflect the boss’s intentions. I am really willing to spend money. Anyway, it is better than the decoration of my home. Hahahaha! In the general environment of the epidemic, it can win the favor of the guests. The sanitation is really reassuring. I touched it. There are no dead ends. Haha Thank the room attendant, thank you for your hard work! My mother’s favorite is the front desk service, Kun Kun, Jia Mei, and the girls who work with Jia Mei. Humane service is the soul of a good hotel. Although they are not very old, Mei Mei is better than my niece. It’s still small, but it’s really considerate and caring for the guests. A small thing will make people feel warm. My mother told me to remember the charming phone number. Next time I bring a friend, I’ll look for her hahahaha 😄 Visible Good employees are the sign of the hotel and the source of the booming business. They will make the stagnant water come alive. Not to mention that a thought is itself a living water. Worry about eating and drinking, I never like to write reviews. I have written so much. Thank you for giving me and my mom a wonderful travel experience. I wish my boss and my business prosperous, every employee is healthy and working smoothly. Looking forward to the next Meet again!

It is very considerate when delivered to the room. It is very convenient to go to Jingjiang Palace, Elephant Trunk Hill, and visit Dongxixiang.

Food: I think breakfast is enough, and afternoon tea is provided in the afternoon, which adds a lot of comfort to the tired self.
Environment: The room is spacious and bright, the bed is very comfortable, and the quilt is moderately thick. I just went to Guilin to live at the Mediterranean house and did not sleep all night. The quilt was too thick.
Hygiene: Cleaning is done every day, and it feels okay.
Service: The waiters are very friendly, and immediately help solve the problem if there is a problem, positive, good 👍🏻
Transportation: There are not too many parking spaces in the hotel. You can turn left when you drive or take a taxi to the intersection to take a taxi or park. The location is spacious and convenient.
There is a swimming pool on the top floor. Although it is not big, it is enough for children to play.
We stayed for 4 nights. The hotel has upgraded the room type. This is good. Although it is on the roadside, it is not noisy and quiet. The children can sleep until 9 o'clock.

At present, I personally feel that the cleanliness is comparable to that of Japanese hotels, and it is cleaner than Maldives hotels. I saw the cleaning aunt at 6 o'clock in the morning.

The service is very good, from management to cleaning, the aunt is proactive, polite and high-quality! Every day I work softly and in an orderly manner. I don't see any confusion, and I am very efficient. I will try my best to meet customer requirements! For breakfast rice noodles, you will be asked whether you have dried noodles or soup noodles. Make them fresh, and there are some other breakfast fruits to choose from. There is room for improvement in the 58-standard breakfast types! (It doesn't matter if the hotel is in the snack street) It was a good experience! ! ! recommend! ! !

First of all, on the day of check-in, the person in the hotel will call you to communicate the check-in time, and add WeChat, and the address will be sent to WeChat in advance. The location is next to Dongxi Alley, very convenient! When we arrived at the front desk of the hotel, we informed that the room had not been cleaned up, so let us wait in the lobby. And informed us that there will be afternoon tea. There are also many varieties of afternoon tea, and it is very satisfying to eat. I felt very good when I entered the room. The decoration is light and luxurious Chinese style, there are many small surprises~ I like the design of the sink very much! There are also bedside lamps, bedside tables, coffee machines, and so on. There is a laundry room, gym and infinity pool on the 7th floor! I rushed to the swimming pool at night and felt like it had been reserved~ Although it was written to close at ten o'clock, no one came to urge it. Because the breakfast did not get up, it was a pity that I did not experience it!
Finally, I boasted that the service was really good. I gave a small gift before I left. I will definitely stay here when I have a chance to come to Guilin again. I force it~

The infinity pool on the top floor of the hotel is very suitable for photo-shooting, and it is very good to watch the sunrise on the terrace on the top floor of the hotel.
The younger sister at the front desk of the hotel is very cute and courteous. At the check-out, the younger sister at the front desk also sent us a small gift.
More thankful is that we forgot the clothes when we left the room. The hotel has contacted us several times.
Thanks to the beauty manager He, who introduced us to Guilin's tourist attractions and food guides, and also specially helped us write it down with paper. Thank you for the hotel.

msg:A very good experience. It belongs to a small and beautiful hotel. The operators of the hotel are very attentive. The rooms are decorated very warmly. The facilities and supplies in the room are also very good. The breakfast is especially praised. Although there are not many varieties, but The taste of every single item is very good, the quality of the humble snacks such as braised eggs, salted duck eggs, and fermented bean curd is very good. It feels more comfortable than the buffet breakfast in some international hotels. The breakfast is on time. It started at 7:30. I feel that it’s a bit late for this kind of tourist-consumer hotel. In addition, the rooftop swimming pool is definitely a “scam”. I also see the operator’s intentions to build a hotel in such a small place. Miniature version of the swimming pool, children have fun

酒店設施和服務也都很好，訂了兩間房，為了給我們安排在一起，還特意給升級了房型，非常貼心了。房間面積不小，各種設施也很齊全，屬於比較新的智慧酒店設計，長者體驗也都很好。
唯一美中不足的，可能就是窗外沒什麼景觀，可能另一側的景觀房會好一些，不過，這個價位，也沒什麼可挑剔的了。

msg:裝修風格我.很喜歡，房間很寬敞，特別是2米的大床很舒服，一進門這個房間顯得特別寬敞還有喝茶的地方，不像所有酒店一個模式，它給人一種新穎，喜歡的感覺，早餐也不錯，米粉很好吃，湯好，還有機器人服務。服務特別貼心，進門就先介紹很清楚，耐心還有洗衣機，游泳池配套很全，而且酒店旁邊吃的很方便，還有特色巷子可以打卡拍照逛逛，總之酒店住着不錯，乾淨，寬敞。就是大門不好找，開車的得把車開到非機動車道才能進大門.，而且機動車道窄並且騎車的人多，我開始找沒找到，就是非機動車道沒敢進，後來指導找到了，總之酒店住的是很舒服的開心！

早餐種類不多，但是也完全能滿足早餐需求了，還有現煮的米粉，味道很不錯。家人訂了旅遊團，出發比較早，也給貼心的打包了早餐。
酒店的位置很好，出了門就是東西巷，吃的東西很多，交通也很方便，步行去了象鼻山和日月雙塔。
如果真的是説不方便的地方，我覺得就是酒店門口衹有台階，沒有坡道，推嬰兒車和行李需要抬着。

msg:1、酒店服務人員在入住前聯繫了我，並告知酒店具體位置、詢問是否有特殊要求；酒店位置雖然有一點點隱蔽，但完全不影響找到它；
2、房間衞生做的不錯，進門第一時間拿濕紙巾擦放行李物品的桌子，擦完基本上濕紙巾都還是白色的；
3、因為入住時天氣冷，房間的暖氣也很足，比較靜音；
4、訂的房間套餐還有贈送水果和飲料
總之 一晚上住下來很滿意～

服務：服務貼心周到，這幾天突然降温，原本的房間因為窗户多開了空調也不夠暖和，於是前台幫我調換了更暖和的房間。
早餐種類不是特別多，但是很精緻，老公説是這幾天在外最好的早餐，還有現煮的米粉。房間裏有膠囊咖啡，對離不開咖啡的人來説真是增加好感度。房間有水果，下午還有精緻下午茶，逛逛東西巷正好回來補充能量。

工作人員都很温柔親切，可以説有求必應了，點贊👍🏻

房間裝修很新也很乾淨，主要看上兩米大床，適合一家三口，近窗位置有個台階，給孩子玩耍看平板電腦，廁所有智能馬桶，在寒冷的天氣下，給屁股帶來一點溫暖。
酒店地理位置非常好，一下樓就到東西巷，甚麼類型的餐廳都有，對面有王城或多走幾步有微笑堂，起市百貨應有盡有，步行街亦有非常多小店小吃。
整體職員服務到位，從前台到清潔阿姨的態度都非常親切，而且非常主動幫忙，主動提供寶寶洗漱用品，管理層應該好好獎勵一下員工。
前後整整住了十天，唯一可以吐糟的地方只有不好打車，幾乎每天出入都打車，但從來沒有一個司機會停在酒店門口，幾乎都是停在公交站，每個都說不知道怎麼開進去，所以酒店應該考慮加一些提示於馬路上，方便司機或者自駕遊的客人

早餐可以選擇的品種不多，但是米粉很好吃。衞生間沒感覺到抽風機，也缺乏掛衣服的地方。雖然不是很大問題，但是對於帶小孩的家庭來説，還是有點不方便。
酒店的位置就在東西巷後面，步行街邊上。由於對出來是輔道，網約車都不敢開進去，衹能拉着行李在機動車道上車，有點危險。如果不是自駕遊，真的有點麻煩，希望酒店想想辦法。
整體來説酒店很好，值得推薦。

酒店的貼心服務值得欣賞；入住客房送上生果拼盆，冰箱有多款免費飲料，下午亦有輕食茶點，退房更奉送心意包，可說是人情物理，兼而有之。

酒店員工服務態度非常良好，殷勤有禮，加上地點適中，雖然落樓轉灣已是步行街，但酒店坐向未有噪音影響，可說是旺中帶靜，靜中帶旺，兩面俱全。

整體而言，泊隱一念間值得高度評價，是值得向朋友推介的住宿地點。

連客房打掃的員工都很有教養, 
入住過的5星酒店中, CP值最高的一家,
早餐很棒, 7F有小泳池, 可比無邊際泳池, 夏天可以看夜景, 打卡.
後方即為東西巷, 走路可到靖王府, 
雖然在繁華地段, 卻無車馬喧嘩.
有停車場, 但包車接送時, 可能要走到門口公車站, 
很近, 但下雨時就不方便.

衞生：房間衞生非常到位，洗漱用品也補充得非常及時。
設施：酒店下午茶的百香果冰粉、銀耳湯和綠豆沙真的超好吃。早餐也非常豐富，雖然跟大酒店比起來種類不是特別多，但是水準很高，還有現煮的桂林米粉。此外酒店7樓還有一個視野超棒的小泳池。對了，7樓還有洗衣機和乾衣機可以用（但是我們沒用）。
總之是非常非常推薦的一家酒店，性價比比較高，服務好！下次來桂林真的會再訂這家酒店，也真心推薦給大家哦！

msg:第一次來桂林最終入住泊隱理由:
1.位置：處於市中心，酒店後門出去就是東西巷，穿過東西巷就是靖王府，距離逍遙閣、象鼻山公園步行分別5、10分鐘左右；
2.服務：酒店總體服務態度非常好👍，前台的帥哥美女有問必答，預訂了兩天房價有波動，立馬退掉一天重新下單另外價低房型，前台小姐姐説是不用退房免費升級，花低價還是續住原房型太給力了！
3環境：酒店雖然不是很大，但是整體設計氛圍理念安靜雅緻非常有意境，很有文墨感覺。
4衞生：對於有點潔癖的我而言泊隱的清潔度達到預期效果，首先房間清爽整潔、其次床品舒適乾淨、最後衞生間毫無異味，枱麪、台盆、浴缸、淋浴房非常乾淨沒看到毛髮之類的，馬桶還是加熱智能的！
5整體：總體來説體驗感很好👌，如果有建議個人覺得早餐品種相對而言較少，建議適當增加品種豐富些。

msg:房間設施：
規模很小，介於星級大酒店和民宿之間的民營酒店。房間佈置的很高級，處處都有用過心思的小細節來凸顯一個雅字。空間很大很寬敞，還佈置了一個可以舒舒服服坐着喝茶的榻榻米空間。
性價比：
包含下午茶和早餐，覺得很合算。
早餐：
品種很多，有現做的桂林米粉，中西式點心、粥、水果，味道也不錯，和房價相匹配。有專人觀察餐枱食物取用情況，並及時添加，能做到這點就説明管理非常好。
服務：
有一支訓練有素的服務團隊，不論是前台還是餐廳人員，都態度在線、服務周到。
位置交通：
後門出去就置身於東西巷，其實走幾步就有地道入口可以穿過地道到正陽步行街，但酒店送的地圖上看不出這個點、問路時也沒有提示到，感覺白繞了好多路，後面還是叫的車司機告訴的。
其他：
酒店旁邊有酒吧或者其他什麼娛樂場所在經營，大概十點多有快節奏流行歌曲響起（幸好不是那種電音，大多是改編後的港台老歌），一直到一點多結束，雖然好聽但是被迫共震。反映後退房時前台送了紅茶手辦，其實和酒店本身沒關係，好像無解。

位於市中心的東西巷，出門走幾步就是東西巷，過了地下通道就是正陽步行街。雖然位於鬧市，但一點噪聲都沒有，晚上休息一丁點都聽不到異響。住的是大床房，房間寬敞，佈置清雅，自動窗簾操作省力，自動噴水馬桶清洗方便。早餐食物搭配很好，品類雖不算太多，但很可口，也能看出店家的用心。店員的服務非常周到，微笑打招呼，自然温馨。
美中略有不足，我們住了好幾天，對房間保潔人員有些建議：
1、地面清潔不夠，有些地方沒有擦到。
2、水果補充不到位，酒店每天贈送的水果有幾個品種，由於沒法削皮，我們就把蘋果留在果盤裡麪，但後面連續幾天就沒有補充水果了，大概以為我們的水果沒吃完就不給了，但我們很喜歡除了蘋果以外的其他水果啊。

大廳有休息區, 餐廳區, 機器人負責送外賣, 24/7 前台服務, 洗衣烘乾房, 日式榻榻米飲茶區, 咖啡機, 浴鹽, 通用電源插頭, 拖鞋, 浴袍, 泳池;

衞生：

這個酒店真的是非常非常乾淨…  衞浴是淺色調 還能那麼乾淨, 説明客房服務的工作人員 衞生做的非常到位👍 浴缸也是 閃閃發光那種乾淨…

環境：

酒店位置非常方便，就在 東西巷裡，但是房間又非常安靜。
步行去象山景區（15-20分鐘）; 靖王府（3分鐘）; 東西巷就更不用説了, 下樓就是; 出門右轉 一分鐘有咖啡店（luckin coffee）; 穿過地下人行道對面有大型商場 有屈臣氏/葯粧等等;

服務：

我們原本預訂的是兩房的套房。一個房間給公婆，一個房間是我們。但是由於沒有客廳，我們衹能穿過公婆的房間出門。推薦兩房的套房給父母和小童，不適合兩對成年人。跟前台溝通完這個情況後，他們立刻給我們分了兩間獨立的大床房。很感謝他們的理解和彈性服務。

除此之外，酒店還提供 4人免費接機/接站服務（豪華別克商務）; 早餐; 下午茶點心蛋糕; 客房免費Mini Bar; 洗衣/烘乾房 等等

msg:這家酒店是一家富有人文氣息的酒店，裝修別緻，前台的工作人員服務自然體貼，前台工作人員的服裝設計自然簡潔 ，體現出傳統的簡潔大方。房間的衞生整體來説不錯，但是了保潔人員要注意檢查衣櫃抽屜內是否有上一位旅客遺落的物品，我在抽屜中發現了上一位旅客遺落的登機牌，希望保潔人員在這方面加強檢查。如有遺落重要物品還可以及時聯繫旅客取回。
酒店的地理位置也不錯，附近餐廳眾多，附近也有超市方便補充日常用品。
酒店處於旅遊景區附近，如果是去火車站或者機場一定要提前出發，附近道路容易擁堵。

服務：滿意，一早打了電話，加了微信號，安排了停車，給了定位，順利到達酒店。門口服務員也很熱心介紹附近吃的逛的買東西的地方。出門幸虧服務員提醒帶了雨傘，沒有被雨淋到。

1.酒店員工非常熱情有禮貌，預訂房間含接機服務，因此一下飛機就體驗到了酒店精心照料。第三天因為做遊輪，早上7點就要出發，酒店還特意提前打包了早餐給我們。
2.房間裏乾淨衞生，提供免費洗衣和乾衣服務。
3.酒店位置很好，離步行街，王府和濱江路都很近。
本次旅行全家7人都對泊隠非常滿意，感謝泊隠為這次旅行增添了不少難忘的回憶。

msg:到了桂林急急忙忙訂的酒店，所以特意來評價一下我個人的感受。
酒店地段很好，酒店後門就是東西巷，吃的東西很多，海底撈奈雪之類的都有，酒店的位置一般在巷子裏面，停車一般比較小的停車場，淡季去還是不用擔心，旺季就得停周邊了。
酒店衞生還是做得比較好的，房間也很大，服務也非常的好，出門迎接行李送上樓，點個外賣都會幫忙送到房間去，進出前台都會打招呼，哪怕在樓道里碰到了搞衞生的阿姨都會有歡迎語，這點確實讓人非常的舒心。
酒店去東西巷還是兩江四湖的碼頭都是非常的方便，位置非常的中心，去哪都很方便，不管是打車還是共享單車，都是10分鐘的路程，離象鼻山景區走路也就15分鐘左右。
我定的是海底小縱隊親子房，價格比普通房貴幾十塊錢，因為孩子喜歡所以沒辦法，我覺得酒店在這方面還是要改良一下，房間和三百多的是一模一樣，然後如果訂了親子房就把床上鋪了個卡通被單搭了個小帳篷配上兩個玩偶就算是親子房了，房間設施和普通房間沒有特別實質上的區別。
其實這個酒店可能去找的時候會讓人很不愉快，前面就是一排房子擋住視線沒有景觀可言，不過確實安靜舒適不會像馬路邊上那樣不關窗就會很吵，入住之後有個榻榻米可以休息一下泡泡茶，房間裏沒有收費項目，配備了咖啡，茶葉茶壺等一些提升細節的東西。衞生間採用了三分離設計智能馬桶等配套設施，洗漱用品和我在南寧五星級酒店裡用的都是一個廠家出品的。
總體來説這家酒店其實是在很用心的經營着，不論服務，衞生，細節都處理得很好，雖然酒店不大但是早餐和下午茶一樣沒落下不比那些大酒店差。總體來説下次如果再去桂林還是會考慮再去入住的。

msg:房間乾淨衞生，服務熱情周到，店員會主動問好並且相信的介紹房間設施和周圍景區
房間空間很大，床是2米超大床，房間燈光設計的很用心有各種模式，榻榻米和中式座椅很有特色。
美中不足是窗外就是樓，沒有風景。不過酒店後門就是東西巷，在市中心這個位置，價格便宜性價比也是非常高了。推薦大家前往

msg:不吹不黑，寫點實話。
1 房間風格有點像全季，但是服務比全季好得多。
2 中午入住的，下午送了點心和冰粉之類的，快天黑的時候又送來了水果，很貼心。
3 有機場的接送服務，接送選一，還是貼心。
4 細節做的很好，前台借充電線，藉口罩，諮詢旅遊和吃飯路線，都很細心。
5 頂層有1米2的泳池，很安靜，帶孩子可以玩。
6 頂層有專門的洗衣房，洗衣服很方便。

説一點不足。外地客人第一次來，不太好要求出租司機走非機動車道，因為有些地方是管理很嚴格的，覺得這樣做會不禮貌。儘管店家給的説明和圖示非常明白了，但是作為人生地不熟的客人，尤其是社恐的人，不太好意思去給司機提要求。可不可以這樣，直接讓車停在公交站的位置，也就是標註着公廁的位置。右邊10米就酒店，走幾步就到，直觀明瞭。

msg:入住體驗一如既往的好。前台的接待很熱情，房型寬敞，裝修很新，配有浴缸，風格偏傳統輕中式但又不古板壓抑，整體風格比較有活力。房間衞生做得很乾凈，備品齊全我也很喜歡。在之前的入住我沒有使用過管家客房服務，這次體驗後非常滿意。在桂林的範圍內這樣多方位體驗令人滿意的酒店屈指可數，非常推薦入住。
