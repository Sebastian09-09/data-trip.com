msg:I decided to stay here as a repeat Staycation in Shenzhen since it is next to Dutch Flower Village, Zhongshan Park, and Nantou Ancient City. The ONLY reason I was in the area is because Shenzhen Airlines messed up on visa requirements for a Qing Ming holiday flight to Vietnam. Most of my stay was on the phone and chat with Trip.com who still has to recover the money, Points, and refunds of 11 total bookings. Despite Trip.com being way less than satisfactory still  a week later while writing this review, I can at least find comfort at Doubletree and it’s surrounding location. Trip.com is still sending emails asking about my trip to Vietnam, when I wasn’t even allowed to board the flight there. I am still waiting on results from trip.com. I can book with the Chinese app or directly at DoubleTree next time. Staff at DoubleTree most helpful.

Roughly six months ago I stayed at this hotel, as I am walking inside my room I see a huge cockroach roaming around the floor. I was absolutely disgusted and furious to know that a five star hotel could have pest problems. 
However, what I find even more disturbing is that I stayed at this hotel again most recently; and instead of seeing one giant cockroach there were at least half a dozen baby cockroaches creeping on the walls and bedside table. The receptionist mentioned pest control comes every Sundays, however I find that hard to believe or maybe just call me unlucky. I will NEVER stay at this hotel again… gross!

The cookies are really delicious. I ate them for the first time at Rugao DoubleTree Hilton. I didn’t expect to eat them at Nanshan Hilton. Thank you Noah at the front desk for giving me a gift. I decisively bought a can and brought it back to Shanghai!
I like the cleanliness of the hotel, the large refrigerator, and the washing machine (although it is not used). It’s really great!

Because this is not my first time staying here, this is my third time.
I used to live in one living room and one room.
But the two-bedroom suite I stayed in this time was worse than the previous room.
The sound insulation is not good. I heard the noise from the room next to me and woke up at around 7 o'clock in the morning.
And next to the entrance, I heard a lot of people walking around.

And I wanted to take a bath. When I saw that the bathtub was not clean,
I have already given up the idea. A room with more than 2,000 yuan is worse than a room with more than 1,000 yuan.
This experience was very bad.

The car was parked for free at the entrance of the hotel, and the hotel also thoughtfully put up sunshades.

I encountered something funny when I checked out: Three cookies were given to our two rooms when we checked in, and the children liked them very much, so we asked the hotel for two more when we came back from outside at night. When I asked for two cookies for the children when I checked out, the lady in black clothes on the right side of the front desk said with an unhappy face: You can go across the street to buy cookies in tins...😂

The room equipment is novel, with electric curtains and screens, and a large The bed is very comfortable, and the bathroom and room are separated by glass. There is also a smart atomizer design that hides and separates the room and bathroom through light-transmitting glass. It is very special. Although I did not book the breakfast package this time because I want to have a rest every day. , get up first at your own time.
 Because the facilities in the hotel are very new, especially the lobby bar and indoor swimming pool equipment, breakfast can be simple. Order a light breakfast in the lobby, and the waiter Jeffers will take good care of it. The service is very professional and attentive. The lobby receptionist Ace also provides The hotel made very considerate arrangements and made me feel that it was the right decision to visit a hotel under the Hilton Group again.
 During the check-in time on the first day, because I was a Hilton Hotel member, I was upgraded to a high-rise building by the receptionist, and faced the Zhongshan Park view directly. It was very beautiful. It made the whole stay feel like being in nature, and it made my wife and I happy. I stay in the hotel longer, especially after dinner in the evening and during tea time at noon. I also want to stay in the room, sit in front of the large floor-to-ceiling glass, and slowly enjoy afternoon tea and happy hour after dinner, and the indoor swimming pool is also included. One highlight is that the water in the swimming pool is clear. Although it has been very cold for the past two days, my wife also went to the comfortable swimming pool and swam several times to relieve work fatigue. The swimming pool environment and facilities are new and clean. There is also a warm water Jacuzzi next to the swimming pool. I also I like to soak in the water here to relieve fatigue.
 The back of the hotel is also a place full of nature and flowers. People who like gardening or flower appreciation can go here to visit and buy potted plants for home. There are also two restaurants in the area, one of which is cat-themed, and the other one is connected The cafe is like a Chinese teahouse. The environment is very quiet. You can quietly avoid the crowds and have a simple lunch in the restaurant. The whole trip this time is also my favorite way to travel. It is very unforgettable. I will go to Shenzhen next time and visit DoubleTree by Hilton. The hotel must be the first choice.

The hardware facilities of the hotel are good, and the overall hygiene is clean. During this stay, we also made birthday decorations and presented exquisite welcome fruits. It would be more perfect if there is a small cake, but the overall experience is still very good and great. ! ! !

The only thing was that there was no bathtub (I don’t know if this is the case in all rooms). Originally, I brought a bubble bath for my child and couldn’t play with it. Breakfast was okay, no surprises or disappoin**ents. The only thing to take away is that I got hurt in the bathroom. When I stood up from my squatting position to change my child's pants, I didn't expect the toilet paper holder on the back, and it directly scratched my waist. It was so painful that I couldn't get up, and I was also injured. This seat really needs more attention!

Go to the hotel to pick up your stuff when you come back. Later, the concierge called me and told me that they had left the computer alone. So the computer was left at the hotel. But you didn’t tell me when I picked up the things, and I went anyway. Later, I was too busy and couldn’t go. I asked SF Express to deliver it to the same city today, but SF Express told me that my computer was broken when I picked it up, which made me feel a little nervous. When I opened it, I found that the shaft was broken and the screen was shattered at the location of the break. When I asked the hotel, they were not responsible at all. They broke it into pieces violently. They even asked SF Express to say that someone else's photo was fake, and they blamed her for being pregnant when SF Express delivered it to her. Everyone, take a look and see if this is the floor at the entrance of the hotel, and it was broken by violent force. Who is so cruel! The point is, the hotel is evading all kinds of excuses! So irresponsible! I was so pissed off with such poor service, and the suite we stayed in was so bad!

There is no subway outside the hotel. If you are not in a hurry, you can ride a bicycle and there is a subway station about 1 km away. I forgot to clean the room on the first day I checked in. When I came back at 10pm, the trash in the room was not thrown away and the towels were not changed at all. I suspected that I was staying at a fake Hilton? ? In the end, Icy, the lobby service staff, helped solve the problem. His attitude and emergency response efficiency were satisfactory, which alleviated the unpleasantness. I'll give it an overall score of 80. The overall service is polite but not sincere. Also, there is a staff member in the breakfast porridge and noodle area who is very poor. After three days of breakfast, he made a bad face the whole time. I feel like I owe him for ordering porridge. It's like money. It is recommended that you get training before taking up the job.

The most unbearable thing was that we ordered a clay pot rice, and the bacon in it smelled like spoiled oil! Extremely nauseating! When I told the waiter, the waiter said, oh, I know, he will report it to the chef, and there will be nothing more. In other restaurants, they will at least make a new one. The charge is very five-star, but the ingredients are too bad! Then I took a shower in my room and found a used band-aid on the bathroom floor! too disgusting!

The hotel staff are quite professional. They also provided mineral water for meetings in the lobby bar in the evening. Jessie also made a special call to check back on the breakfast taste and check-in experience. The service was very considerate.

This time I chose a room with a city view. Although the arrangement is relatively high, I still look at it Downstairs, the bus terminal, the view is a bit eclipsed, no wonder its garden view rooms are more expensive, the hotel's swimming pool is indoors, the design is okay, but I feel that the lifeguards next to them are not very professional, so they know how to tell you to wear them hats, but sometimes there is no one in the audience, they actually sit outside, not looking at the guests, a bit dangerous and unprofessional

msg:After returning to China after two years, I was amazed by the high-quality service of this hotel. First of all, I would like to praise the security guards at the door, who are warm and polite, help open and close the car door, pick up and drop off luggage, and sometimes greet the car politely and help guide the car while waiting for the car. (Interlude, the sun was quite high when I checked out the next day, and I found out that I even hung up the sunshade for the vehicles parked at the door. This detail can reflect the quality of the service. I heard that it has been open for more than two years, and it can It is rare to maintain such a high quality)

Angela, the little partner in the front office, helped me check in when I heard that I hadn’t come back for a long time, and helped to upgrade the room type. She also asked carefully about the needs and pointed out the location of the hotel facilities. Thank you very much! The room faces Bao'an Old Town (Old Bao'an is ecstatic, it has changed a lot)

Then there is Danley in the concierge depar**ent, who helped to transport the luggage (the four pieces of luggage are really tied to q who knows) thank you! And also very polite!

The room is very spacious. I didn't look carefully at the types of rooms they have. I feel that this is enough for the next time I order it. The cleanliness of the room is generally satisfactory, and the necessary spare parts are delivered in a timely manner. The gym is well received, very hygienic and the temperature is suitable.

Generally speaking, the standard of this hotel is really far beyond its original positioning (Doubletree overseas is really a lot of guest house level). The biggest surprise is that the staff in all depar**ents of the hotel have a homely service attitude. , many details hope that other colleagues can learn from it.

They told me that there was no room available. After I checked out, I was told that I could change the room. However, when I checked out, they asked me to pay the difference because the room I was given was different. They didn’t tell the hotel that they would have to pay the difference when upgrading the room. There were previous complaints from guests about the musty smell. They also charged extravagantly. I strongly recommend not to stay in this hotel. There is absolutely no professional ethics and a lack of management. It is ruining the reputation of the Hilton hotel brand.

It takes a long time to plug them in with force. The toilet always worries me that it will get clogged and it will take a long time to hold water. The water temperature of the shower head is not enough. Cutlery was provided but it felt quite dirty and needed to be washed. The Wi-Fi computer had to be disconnected after a few hours and had to be restarted to connect. Finally, customer service helped to log in without verification. The breakfast category can only be said to be average. The hot meat dishes are average and have a lot of fat. Thousands of dollars on Prime Monday night. You have to go downstairs to get takeaways by yourself. The configuration of the robot is really lagging behind. It doesn’t meet the five-star standard for me. The price-performance ratio is really not high.

Stand and watch! The cleaner dipped the brush head into the water in the toilet and then wiped the toilet mat🤮. After all, he also used Hilton's name. Can we take a snack? Besides, the front desk is so unprofessional. Until now, many days after checking out, I still don’t know how my deposit was retained? Is it reserved? Is it pre-authorization? guarantee? I asked how to keep the deposit? The female receptionist repeatedly said it was just a deposit! What form of deposit am I asking? She probably didn't understand that she rolled her eyes and was speechless, that the male receptionist was even weirder and kept repeating it and would return it, and that people's trust is determined by the spirit of the contract, not by your words! If you don’t understand, you can learn and get training. It would be unkind to cover up your ignorance with silence and let others accompany you. Because it was arranged by the other company, I gritted my teeth and persisted for a week. This week gave me a shock. I miss the old Hilton. *******************

She was enthusiastic and patient. Next to the hotel is the Holland Flower Town. The location is very good, and there are no obstacles around. As soon as we got off the bus, the staff at the door would run up to open the door and help us with our luggage. The service is really in place. The staff RYAN and ANGELA at the front desk also helped us to upgrade, and they enthusiastically sent us hot and delicious ququ cakes. This time we upgraded to the Doubletree Suite. The room is very large and the layout is very reasonable, and There are floor-to-ceiling windows everywhere, and the view is wide. My favorite is the kitchen facilities, where I cooked a Mid-Autumn Festival dinner. Aunt Zhu in the guest room was very patient and brought us tableware. Seeing that we were carrying children, she also thoughtfully brought us an extra set of toiletry utensils and slippers. It is worth mentioning that it is very convenient to do nucleic acid in the hotel every day from 6:00 to 7:00 without going out to do nucleic acid.
The afternoon tea is particularly amazing. You can choose your own drinks, including cappuccino coffee, tea, etc., and the desserts are even more varied and taste very good. The overall experience is impeccable. The front desk staff and room service staff, including the little brother at the door, are very polite in every gesture.

The baby sleeps with a 360-degree rotation. Please ask the service staff to push the bed and move the sofa to create a safe sleeping environment. The bed is overweight~ The two little brothers are sweating profusely~
To tell the truth, it is not called a parent-child hotel if you put a tent doll. Many children do not have equipment for children, and the restaurant does not even have children's meals. I hope the managers really want to be a parent-child hotel, rather than trying to make money from the name of a parent-child hotel. this money
Although many hardware facilities and conditions are not parent-child, all the staff are very conscientious! For these services, this hotel will still be the first choice when staying in Nanshan.

Like Jasmyn, the duty manager, because I contacted the hotel in the early morning and told the hotel that I would arrive before noon due to itinerary problems. Jasmyn was very considerate and helped to arrange the room in advance. I strongly recommend that everyone stay at the hotel and choose Nanshan Hilton. Doubletree & Apar**ents Oh,

For the first time, I have lost a can of makeup remover, thinking that there is not much left. It's gone, and it's incredible that the clothes disappeared in a few days. Speaking of this, if you don't want to complain, you should complain again. The rags in the room can be delivered for two hours. I'm even luckier. It was not delivered until 5 o'clock. I was speechless. Personally, I don't recommend this kind of hotel where things are easy to lose. Although the clothes are not expensive, they are only a few hundred yuan, but they are inexplicably placed in the room. Will they not be there... nothing more to say

msg:The first time I stayed at DoubleTree by Hilton was seven years ago when I was investigating a hotel project in Los Angeles. After the inspection, the hotel owner asked us how we felt about the inspection. I blurted out that I was deeply fascinated by the DoubleTree’s welcoming chocolate cake. I remember the DoubleTree by Hilton brand deeply because of this baked hot chocolate chip.

During the epidemic, I couldn’t go abroad, and I had to hesitate for a while when I went out of the province. I finally decided to choose a hotel in Nanshan to pretend to be on vacation! When I saw the familiar logo of Doubletree on Ctrip, I decided to place an order.

On the day I brought the baby in, I really ate this chocolate cake that I was thinking of! It is still the same warm and warm temperature, and no matter how hot it is, it is not as warm as the hotel front desk! Especially Miss Shi who greeted us! Not only was it conveyed by colleagues My child brought a bath ball and wanted to soak in the bathtub and helped us upgrade to a high-level suite, and even more intimately noticed the satisfied smile when we ate the chocolate cake! Miss Shi specially brought us two more when changing rooms for us. Chocolate cake! No matter if I see Miss Shi at the front desk or the elevator during the next check-in process, Miss Shi will blurt out my surname and call me! It's really a home away from home! This detail is rare!

The hotel's breakfast is also very good. There are a lot of fresh fruits and you can make your own juice. All kinds of side dishes in the hotel are delicious in the morning. When preparing for a bowl of hand-cooked noodles, the staff at the location happened to walk away temporarily. The chef just happened to see me. He didn't go to instruct the waiter, but came over to help us cook the noodles in person. It really shows the high level of service of Doubletree in detail!

The swimming pool is more comfortable, privacy is good, and you can often take a dip in the pool during the day, so happy!

Thank you to you at DoubleTree for making our two-day "trip" at the door of our house happy and comfortable, no less than traveling abroad!

The hotel swimming pool is not big, the water temperature is slightly cooler, adults can swim, it is not recommended for babies who are too small, but the jacuzzi next to it is suitable for babies to play, the water temperature is relatively high, and it feels like a hot bath. The service was also very attentive, with someone staring on the shore during the whole process.
The breakfast variety is not too much, there are all that should be, and the taste is okay.
The location is very good, the flower town and park next to it give a lot of extra points.
The room hygiene is OK. I called the hotel in advance and told me that there was a baby. I thoughtfully prepared a baby cot so that I could take a nap when I checked in. Welcome cookies were delivered at the front desk. I felt a bit sweet, but the children liked them very much.
The two tickets for the Ferris wheel I sent can go until February. I am afraid that there will be too many people on the New Year's Day holiday, so I plan to find another time to go.
There were no toiletries in the room. The waiter brought them from behind and gave the children slippers and toothbrushes. But the comb was what I asked for when I went to the front desk later.

From check in, I was struggling to check in with two bags of luggage without any staff helping me. Second! I can't understand being a parent-child hotel but not assigning staff to manage groups of children yelling in the lobby, people who don't know will think I've entered a vegetable market.
After checking in, what is the age of the hotel TV and even the TV station has no signal to watch, okay! Screencasting doesn't work either. I live and play with my fingers! Going to find a shower cap by the time I get ready to take a shower! Only to find that this hotel does not even provide disposable toiletries. It really left me speechless ~ figure out my position! It's not selling commercial housing, it's opening a hotel to open a hotel! ! How are five stars rated?
The air conditioner is not cold at night, the quilt is thick, and the sound insulation is poor~
It is not recommended for family and friends to travel. The check-in experience is poor.

There is a washing machine and a refrigerator, it is very convenient to live, the bed is too comfortable, and the lighting a**osphere is also very good. I sent big biscuits 🍪, very delicious. Breakfast is slightly less than ordinary Hilton hotels, but fortunately the taste is online. The swimming pool facilities are good, but the water temperature of the large swimming pool is too low, it is recommended that the temperature can be increased, and the others are very good.

msg:During the Mid-Autumn Festival, I stayed in Shenzhen with my wife and children, and specially selected a hotel for the holidays to change my mood and a**osphere. It was originally a general parent-child room type. The hotel helped us upgrade to a large room with a kitchen and living room of more than 80 square meters. The children played slides, swings, and tents, running around in it, very happy. On the whole, it is clean, comfortable, spacious, and good service; not in a hurry, not crowded, and very relaxing throughout the holiday.

🔔Service: You can order meals to the room, but there are not as many varieties as other Hiltons. I went to the restaurant downstairs for dinner. There will be more varieties. Hilton’s products have always been very good.

msg:Recently, the baby likes to travel. I took advantage of the weekend to accompany my mother to Shenzhen to find friends. I booked the Big Mouth Monkey Suite. The hotel is conveniently located. There are Nantou Ancient City and Flower Town nearby. It is generally clean and sanitary and satisfactory, but the slide location is still available. A little safety hazard, there is a step behind it. If a child accidentally slips and falls back, it is very dangerous, so it is recommended to take some protective measures. The pool and gym are also good.

msg:At this moment, I was woken up by the hotel decoration. I had no choice but to write this short essay to give my sincere feedback on my true feelings after staying at the DoubleTree by Hilton Shenzhen Nanshan for 3 months: First of all, pictures 2 and 3 are of the hotel. The sanitary conditions should not be up to Hilton hotel standards; Secondly, Video 1: We were sick and stayed in this hotel to see a doctor. Our only request was for a quieter room. Every time there was noise, we recorded it. Video or ask the duty manager to go to the room to feel the noise, and the hotel is not soundproof. The room has been changed at least 5 times. Regular guests have a lot of luggage and are not willing to change rooms unless it bothers them. There has been noise recently. The high-rise and low-rise confinement centers are being renovated. I have no choice but to decorate within a reasonable time. It’s really frustrating. The whole hotel is being renovated together. The solution every time is to change rooms. They also say that they have tried their best. What other parts of the hotel are there? It is not decorated; it is understandable that the hotel needs maintenance occasionally. After staying here for 3 months, renovations continued! Next, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, and Figure 7 are during the communication process. The hotel staff did not know that the bathtubs in the rooms were different in size. After the hotel staff measured them on the spot, they admitted that the bathtubs were different in size. After 3 months, Our only request was for a quieter room. We were not rude or had any disputes when communicating with the hotel. We were just being realistic. The hotel’s sales and business director actually blocked our WeChat account. We could see them before. From Moments, can Hilton hotel sales staff block customers even if they no longer provide services? What kind of work attitude is this? I haven’t shown up to this day! Finally, the hotel said the price they gave us was very low and they couldn't give us Hilton hotel points. Later, after coordination with the person in charge, 2 room vouchers were given. If we extended our stay in the third month, we said it was unreasonable not to receive points, so we would not give room vouchers or points? After communication, the person in charge of the hotel replied that they will not give points or room vouchers. We remember that we did not sign an agreement with you on the price, and it cost 60,000 Canadian dollars in 3 months. We have been members of Ctrip for many years and have frequently stayed at 5 stars at home and abroad. In the past, it was all through Ctrip. This time, we also learned about the situation and rating of this hotel through Ctrip. We have not reviewed any five-star hotels in many years. Ctrip attaches great importance to this and Ctrip is still very responsible. We have also read other negative reviews of this hotel, and they are indeed very fair. The service is not up to standard, guests are ignored, and there is a problem with playing football. Finally, we complained to Ctrip before the management came forward to solve the problem. This hotel is not soundproof and it is difficult to walk quickly and pull up chairs in other rooms. The sound is very harsh, and it is with the neighbors upstairs. You can imagine the feeling. The current attitude of the hotel gives us the feeling of regular guests that they hope that we move out as soon as possible. If you think it is troublesome for us, we will also be in better health. If the situation arises, we will move out immediately. As a regular guest, the hotel will not maintain it at all, but we hope that the leaders of the Hilton Group will listen to the voices of regular guests... and take them seriously. Disclaimer: The purpose of this review is not to obtain any hotel benefits. Our only request is that the room be quieter. Frequent room changes are also very difficult for guests who are sick and need to rest. The service of this DoubleTree by Hilton hotel is indeed Like other reviews, it makes guests feel like it is a fake Hilton.

Have the comfort of a Hilton hotel and the convenience of an apar**ent after moving in. The service staff is very good. Sincerely consider the occupants. Thank you very much 🙏. The hotel rooms are cleaned every day very carefully. It's like staying for the first time. Thank you, the hotel environment is very good. Facing the adjoining Zhongshan Park and the Dutch Flower Town, there is a very comfortable feeling. It's really not easy in this modern city like Shenzhen! I chose Shenzhen Nanshan DoubleTree Hotel and Apar**ent because of its high score, clean, convenient transportation and good service attitude. I have been to Shenzhen before but staying at the hotel is relatively old. This hotel and apar**ent are very convenient to have all kinds of electrical appliances. They are all very good from Electrolux 👌Give a big praise 👍Thank you again for the efforts of the hotel and apar**ent. Hope to continue. Breakfast is abundant in the restaurant. The environment is beautiful and clean. The food is rich, Western food and Chinese food are available. Very good to give five points of praise. Hope to keep working hard. Thank you 🙏 will come in the future.

After visiting the market, I fell asleep and wanted to move the mattress home. The towel was the softest hotel I have ever stayed in. The light in the photo is also beautiful, and the people in the bathroom are particularly white, haha. Very happy experience. The service attitude of the hotel is also super good. Johnson from the concierge gave me a doll when I left, hahaha. Will come to live next time. By the way, the koi outside the lobby is so big!

It is indeed a high-end hotel of the Hilton series. It gives me a great sleep. The apar**ent hotel is also equipped with complete equipment. The washing machine integrated with washing and drying is my favorite. After many business trips, I got a rest in this hotel, especially Recommended is his gym, the swimming pool is very good, the equipment is very full, and the opening hours are late enough. The breakfast is very rich, there are not many people, but the service is perfect. There is a detail: there is a group of stains on the ground, there is a hotel manager (lady), wearing professional clothes (short skirt is very inconvenient), did not wait for the cleaner to clean up, very elegant squatting clean.
When checking in, each person gave a small cookie baked in the hotel, which was a bit sweet and delicious.
I had already checked out and left. The flight was cancelled due to the weather. I changed the flight for the next morning. However, I did not choose to check in at the airport. I took a taxi back to the Hilton Hotel and checked in again. The front desk staff were so kind.
Behind the hotel is a flower market. Those who like flowers can go shopping.
The little brother at the front desk who received me is my fellow Shandong, and he is also very kind.
Next time I go to Shenzhen, I will choose this hotel to stay.

After waiting for more than half an hour, they will bring you a bottle of mouthwash, but the water has not been delivered yet. I called and waited again, but the room was not clean enough. There were hairs on the bedside and a few long hairs. The bathroom floor was not clean. I communicated with the front desk to clean it. When I came back five hours later, it was still dirty and no one came to clean it. I was really angry. Finally Importantly, the front desk and guest rooms have no service attitude or awareness. They completely ignore the needs of customers and talk to themselves.

酒店設施風格簡約，舒適。但有些地方設計不合理，例如￼廁所化妝鏡的高度過高，不可向下調，但影響不大。

泳池和早餐都不錯
缺點是外賣要到大堂自取

另外早餐時想要一碗瘦肉蔬菜粥，￼服務生叫我十分鐘後取。他說現在不做這個粥。我想自助早午餐不是根據客人要求下單嗎？我10分鐘回去，他仍然說還沒做，最後我便拿了一碗什麼肉都有的粥。

而且服務很好！因為是紀念日Stella還幫我們免費升級成豪華一居室公寓！服務有求必應！然後房子很大，都是落地窗，很喜歡白天進去，房子是亮堂的感覺，而且整體衞生很乾凈，擺放整齊，而且户型設計合理，特別喜歡酒吧桌子的設計！！整體五星好評

（唯一要吐槽的地方是要收一千按金...）

但到我當晚入住時，房聞(所謂無煙)裏那股臭煙味強烈到令我想吐，我打去前台尋求幫助時，他的第一個建議不是和我換房，而是提供一個空氣清新機給我，叫我開一陣，如果有煙味再找他，最終輾轉幾回才有房間可以替換，本人認為在處理手法上有欠妥善，也許是我期望太高。

但浴室熱水不太熱，浸浴的水一陣巳很快凉了，不能把浴盬浴掉，已叫他們维修，但都沒有太大改善
本來房間有提供咖啡膠囊，但冇提供奶，咖啡伴侶，問前台他們說沒有提供
服務方面很滿意，特別感謝员工stella，她會提早帮我安排，及提供意見

套房：客廳空調系統有問題，排風極之弱，工程人員檢查後表示沒問題（不解）我不時因太侷促奄悶而感到呼吸困難
客房：空調排風正常
廚房：沒有煮食用具，餐具只有2刀2义，2碟
洗衣機：會在最後階段時震動，連整部機移動出一尺位。（奇怪）
厠所：454ml 的洗手液，在第二天已沒有（我們是正常用量）

（不會再考慮入住）

(第一晚沒有味道，第二天出去後回酒店發現有味道，很強烈，很像汗味，打去尋求協助，酒店給我們空氣清新機，使用空氣清新機兩小時後就沒有味道了，懷疑是清潔人員出的汗味，但空氣清新機可以解決這個問題)。

因為太喜歡，之後再訂多2晚！
住在同一個房間總共4天！

打過去要求枕頭，被子和拖鞋，他們主動了很多瓶水和牙刷😂

只是第二天出去回房間有汗味後，第一和第三，第四天沒有味道了！其他全部都滿分哦！

下次我們都一定會再住這個酒店也會推薦給朋友哦！❤️

服務：
門崗接待有人幫忙指引，幫忙搬行李，門口有位置也可以停車
前台 seven，stella小姐姐好好看，服務非常好，主動詢問有沒有停車，有沒有牙刷，剛好check in在6點，送了兩個熱乎乎的巧克力曲奇餅乾，自家烘焙的，好好吃，剛好飯點肚子也餓了，很貼心。
保潔阿姨服務很好，洗澡打濕了拖鞋，讓他幫忙送兩雙過來，很快就送到了，而且還給了2-3瓶水，一包紙巾。看得出這家酒店真的是用心在服務。
進去的時候已經給了6瓶水（一般是配2-3瓶）。

設施：睡覺的地方也很合理，兩個床頭的位置都可以充電，插頭是兩用的，英式中式都可以用！
還有個辦公桌可以辦公用。
衞生間有一個浴缸，一個淋浴間，想怎麼洗都可以，衞生間有個電子霧化玻璃，可以看到外面大廳，還帶了廚房。聽説有一個游泳池，但是還沒去玩過。
價格中規中矩，比萬豪便宜，比一般的五星級貴一點的，但是也物超所值，地方也很好找，去保安區各個地方都很方便，去醫院看醫生也很方便。
第二天又重新定了這裏！不過景觀一般般，可能住的是個普通的雙床房。

服務態度沒問題，住的幾天就沒開過車門，服務意識還是很好的。
外賣要去外賣櫃前台無法收，沒有外賣機器人比較遺憾。
另外是……住宿臨時要出差再回來的話，不入住期間停車費着實離譜了，120/天……算是個小缺點吧
整體好評，出行方便，不過周邊真沒啥

msg:Double tree和LA的一樣 check in後有美味的cookies 不同於深圳別的酒店check in要等到3點後由於飛機11點到達 我們是中午12點多就到了酒店check in 
最重要的是親子房間孩子真的很喜歡 有滑滑梯🛝和帳篷 還送了寶寶洗漱套包
早餐後等電梯時孩子因好奇摔壞了一個小瓷器 經理電話後第一件事是關心寶寶有沒有受傷而不是要求賠償 真的很暖心👍總體來説體驗感特別好 強推

衹是有一個事情挺無語，房間內打電話撥禮賓服務線問能不能延遲退房，接電話的工作人員要問我是什麼原因要延遲退房？？？這不是客人私隱嗎？有什麼理由酒店需要過問呢？能不能延遲查系統告知一聲即可，為什麼還要先問原因再決定給不給延遲？希望酒店給個別工作人員再培訓一下專業度吧。
