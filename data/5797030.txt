Clean and sanitary, friendly service, nice mountain view, you can also ask the waiter for children's slippers and toothbrushes, and the breakfast is also rich. The buffet in the evening is ok, and the price-performance ratio is relatively high.

The facilities in the room are also very good and the hygiene is acceptable. However, there are too few breakfast items on the second day of the holiday. When I went there at 9:15, the breakfast was about to close and they didn't replenish the items. There was improvement in the next two days.

msg:Zhuantang is close to the mountains and has a good place to stay. The large balcony is green. The garden auntie at the back mountain is the biggest highlight of this hotel. The twin bed room has a width of 1.35 meters, and the baby bed provided is a good baby. The full set of bathrooms is from the TOTO brand, and the large bathtub and washlet are all configurations of luxury hotels. The evening buffet gives the biggest discount to the guests staying in the hotel, and the dishes are rich and delicious. The quality of the breakfast the next day is online, and the service staff is warm and friendly. In addition, the auntie at HSKP was specifically praised. Finally, because the baby took a nap, I applied for a late check-out at 2 o'clock, and the front desk guy also readily agreed. It is worth coming again.

But the environment here is good, and the hygiene is very good after checking in. The room is large and convenient for luggage. The balcony leads to the oxygen bar in the back mountain, and breakfast is provided, which is very satisfactory! There are also fast food restaurants and convenience stores downstairs to meet the needs, and it's also very fast to order takeout. I will consider it next time I come~

The balcony in the room is very large, facing the back mountain. The air is very fresh when you open the floor-to-ceiling windows in the morning. The bathtub and electric toilet are very clean, and the pillows and bedding are of top quality. The hotel also has a wide variety of breakfasts, which are basically handmade food, with no pre-prepared dishes. When I left the hotel, I gave the manager some optimization suggestions and also gave him two hotel drink coupons. It was full of details. I hope the store will get better and better. I have been attracted and will choose Phoenix Art Center every time I go to Hangzhou on business.

msg:I often help clients book this hotel because they like the quiet environment. However, there have been two reports of customers losing things in the room. The first time was a charging cable and the second time was an iPad rubber protective cover. The hotel responded that they had not seen it. The front desk's attitude in handling the lost items of customers was not very good. There was a female waiter at the front desk. I made a bad face throughout the whole process. Although it was not a valuable item, the loss of something in the room means that the hotel management is worrying. It might be a misunderstanding once, but losing something twice is a big deal. . . I will never consider booking this hotel for my customers again!

It’s really pleasant to stand on the balcony in the early morning, looking at the green mountains and listening to the chirping of birds. The guy at the front desk is very nice, gentle and attentive. My son said he was dissatisfied. After checking out at noon, we waited for the car to pick us up in the lobby. We ordered takeout on the way. After eating, we collected the garbage and prepared to throw it away, but we couldn't find the trash can. We asked a young lady waiter, but she was very unhappy. The son said: Our trash can is full, you can't throw it here. What I want to say is that even if I don’t clean it up, it should be fine if I put it on the table. How could I do this to a child? In such a hot weather, he had to take the garbage outside the hotel and throw it away. This was only told to me later. I really feel that not everyone is kind

msg:The breakfast waiter randomly pointed at a spot on the pillar and said it was 1.2 meters. Wearing shoes, he said we were over the limit. The child's physical examination was less than 1.2 meters. If it is a little over, you have to pay. In fact, it doesn't matter whether we adults eat breakfast or not. I just planned to accompany the child because he wanted to eat, but in the end, he was not in the mood to eat anymore. I want to say that rules are dead, but people are alive. Originally, it was also New Year's Day, and there were very few people in the hotel. In fact, the waiter could communicate with the restaurant leader. A child can't eat much, so if we insist on the 1.2 meter standard, then Just put the height and size line there instead of the waiter pointing it out casually, which greatly affects the experience. Originally we shot a lot of videos, and my friend is also a Xiaohongshu blogger, but now he doesn’t post about hotels anymore. The front desk didn't remind us of the parking coupon when we checked out, so we had to make another trip, hoping it would be more user-friendly.

The key is that this is the first time I encountered a hotel where there was no one at the front desk when I checked in and when I left. One of them shouted at the top of his lungs when checking in that someone came late, saying that he was the only one at night and had to deal with other things. Does this hotel save labor costs so much? Chain hotels don’t do this either! What a great experience.
