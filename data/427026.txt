Secondly: the hotel staff are very friendly to the guests. Cherrie at the front desk is professional, enthusiastic and meticulous. She gave the children small red flags and steam eye masks.

The beauty at the front desk, Miss Cherry, was gentle and generous. She not only helped upgrade the room type, but also arranged fruits and welcome cards in advance. She was meticulous and made people feel at home! It's a pity that I didn't have time to have breakfast. I will choose Renaissance Renaissance if I have the chance next time!

Environment: I came to Disneyland with my children this time. The hotel is very close to Metro Line 18 and Line 9! When I came back in the evening, I went to Century Park for a stroll, which was very convenient!
Service: The service is super good, special praise to Ms. Chen, the deputy manager of the lounge! Before checking in, we called in advance to ask about our room preferences. Knowing that we had children with us, they helped upgrade to a larger room and gave us free fruit! During the check-in process, the front desk was also very friendly to children. They even gave us children's toothbrushes. They were attentive and patient!
Overall highly recommended!
I will still choose your hotel next time I have the chance!

When I booked, I had two. The front desk said that I would give the children breakfast for free and it would be added to the notes. The child said that this hotel is quite generous. I was touched and my good impression of it instantly doubled. I must give a good review then. This morning at breakfast, I was no longer touched. The restaurant said that it was not a thing. I could only buy an adult meal on the spot (cheaper than half the price of the hotel). When I checked out at noon, I told the matter and they said they would call me back. I have already left Shanghai and returned home, and there was no call. It’s not that the matter is big or the money is how much, but it feels bad to go back on one’s word. I hope it can be improved.

Hanna, a tall and fat female receptionist, when we arrived at the hotel at 5 pm and had a reservation in advance, she didn't raise her head and said coldly: there is no room, and we have to wait for 1.5 hours. We asked for the solution many times, but didn't answer a word with a cold face, and our attitude was very bad! Is the customer going to consume or to be angry? The good mood of the day was completely broken!
I usually travel with my parents and live in various four- and five-star hotels. I have never encountered such a low-quality front desk, and I have always had a good impression of high-end hotels. This time with her boyfriend, is this ****?
Anyway, it is also an old five-star hotel, so the staff management is so inappropriate and the quality is so worrying? If it is an intern as the supervisor said, it is time to consider the assessment during the period. If it is a regular employee, then the hotel staff management can be strengthened, and I will also post blogs on various platforms to avoid lightning from your home

I originally booked an executive double room, but I was told that there is no double bed... I changed it to a twin room.
I haven't been to the executive lounge, so I don't know what the conditions are

msg:I will really thank you, the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. I have never written a review before, I am too lazy to write, this bad review must be sent.
First of all, the air conditioner does not heat. The temperature in the room is 23 degrees. After using the hot air conditioner, it becomes 21 degrees. It can only be turned off.
Secondly, summer thin quilts are still used in the room in winter, and there is no spare quilt in the room, and the air conditioner is broken. I was woken up by freezing in the middle of the night, and I was too lazy to ask the waiter to change the winter quilt.
Again, I am a lazy person, I have to sleep in wherever I live, and I forgot to press the do not disturb button. The hotel cleaning actually knocked on the door at 10 o'clock in the morning and asked if I want to do laundry. I am convinced, I am convinced! ! Even if I don’t press Do Not Disturb, I live in so many hotels and I don’t knock on the door at 10 o’clock to disturb the rest of the guests.
Small episode - it was also the first time I was woken up at 7:00 am in a hotel. What woke me up was democracy, peace, reform, and development... Don't ask, the guest next door is very energetic, and I started listening to the morning at 7:00 am News, I smashed the mineral water bottle on the next wall and he kept his voice down. The guest next door has half the credit for giving this bad review.

But the fact is that after checkin at 10 o'clock in the evening, there is a waiter but only one counter is opened. The person in front of me said that it has been a long time in line. Then one enters the room. . . There were several hairs in the bathtub! ! ! Really convinced, 🤢! Called customer service to complain, just apologized lightly.

I asked the waiter and told me that there was nothing I could do. Didn’t the waiter collect it? Also speechless. I asked her to reassign me a seat, and she told me to find it myself. I don't know where the guest came from and grabbed my seat for breakfast, and no one intervened even to eat and take food. The hotel management is really bad, and I won't go there in the future!

During the May Day period, there are many people, and you need to queue up for check-in and dining, and the manpower is slightly insufficient.

Because the itinerary changed and I stayed for another day, I went to the front desk to swipe the room card. In a very quiet environment, I told the front desk to trouble the aunt for cleaning and did not respond. After swiping the room card, I was serious again. Seriously, I asked my aunt to do the cleaning. The lady at the front desk was very friendly when I checked in, but the experience was very bad when I continued my stay today. In addition, the sound insulation of the room is almost not good. In the morning, I could hear the conversation next door and the noise in the corridor. The sound of people talking, and the elevator card has to be inserted several times before responding. Marriott's service attitude has always been very good in my heart. This time it is also a surprise.

Three points to complain: First, the response at 3 am on the first night of stay The pillow smells bad. My little brother brought a child pillow. It's a little small. Fortunately, there is no smell and I can sleep peacefully. When I went out the next morning, I reported the smell of the pillow to the front desk of the hotel again. I don't know if the pillow has been replaced, but there is still a strange smell. Fortunately, the children's pillow is still there. I dealt with the second night. After breakfast in the morning, I reported the smell of the pillow again. I got a reply and I will respond to the housekeeping depar**ent. Ah 😔! The children's pillow is good for another night, thinking that your entire hotel pillow is smelly! Fortunately, the room is on the executive floor and faces south, so let's dry the pillow yourself! The moment I removed the pillowcase, I was disgusted. See the picture for yourself! The second point is that the air-conditioning in the breakfast room of the hotel is almost not cooling, do you want to say no? It's really not like it's 38 degrees outside, you want to say yes? Eat breakfast and sweat profusely. Third, there are not many kinds of breakfast, but they are enough to eat, but the hygiene is really uncomplimentable. This is the lettuce leaf in the breakfast salad area, and there is actually sediment in it, it is sediment! I don't want to talk nonsense with this hotel anymore. I won't come to live again next time, and I also remind everyone not to live here. In addition, there is construction around the hotel, and piling starts at 8:00 on Saturday morning, and I will still be woken up when I live on the 24th floor. The experience of six days and five nights is very poor. Wish the hotel put more effort into the details rather than apologizing afterwards.

The hotel's air conditioner is useless, turned on 25 degrees all night, and it is still only 17 degrees. This is the first time I have stayed in such a cold five-star hotel. The buddy at the breakfast noodle stall was not in good spirits. He told me that I should wear a mask when I went to pick up some noodles. If I need to wear a mask, everyone who goes to the hotel for breakfast will have to wear a mask at any time. This kid also gave the number to the noodle orderer, you are number nine, he is number eleven... When the noodles are ready, call, number nine comes to pick up the meal! Come pick up the meal on the eleventh! It was the first time I experienced being called out for dinner at a five-star hotel, which was similar to seeing a doctor in a hospital. What's even more weird about this kid is that he went to a guest's table and told them, sir, the wonton you ordered has already been prepared, please go and pick it up yourself. People nodded and ignored him. He has come over here, if it is for service, he should bring the wontons. What he is doing now is nothing more than blame, or even condemnation. Even if he had breakfast, he would be reprimanded by the noodle chef. That old man must have a galloping heart.

The bathroom smells bad, and the 17th floor is unlikely to be the smell of the sewer!
The sound insulation is very poor, I didn't sleep well all night, and I heard the chat next door!
The breakfast variety is quite rich, but the taste is average.
The experience is not good, will not consider it again

msg:Be sure to praise this hotel well

Our family likes to travel, but now because of the epidemic, we can't go out of Shanghai, and we still often take the elderly and two children to play in hotels in Shanghai.

Firstly! ! This hotel! It is the only hotel that let me stay for one night and decided to stay for another night on the spot! ! Ranked in the top three hotels in my mind!
Arriving at the Renaissance Chunda Hotel, first of all, the door makes people feel very grand, and the slight fragrance in the lobby makes people feel more comfortable. I booked three rooms, and the front desk responds to the requests of different people in each room. One of the gaming rooms smelled musty. I went to the front desk to respond. Aily, who was on duty at the front desk, immediately changed me a room. And carefully ask about the room musty smell.
In addition, the e-sports room must blow up! ! For me, who is a bit clean, the computer keyboard, mouse, and even headphones are relatively new and have no stains. First of all, people have the desire to sit down and play games. Secondly, there are so many types of games! Suitable for adults and children of all ages.
At 12:00 in the morning, I went to the front desk to renew my room for the next day, and I was still warmly received by aily, prepared the room for the next day for me and also sent breakfast to my two children. Thanks aily for your warm service!

The breakfast is rich, the replenishment is timely, the service is warm, and the taste is also good.
The swimming pool is tidy and clean, and there are few people. Our family almost covers the entire swimming pool. Towels are carefully stacked by the pool. I saw a little brother even carefully adjusting the angle of each towel, keeping the opening direction of each towel roll in the same direction... Like and like, the details are everything, and I continue to increase my favor for this hotel time and time again.
In the evening of the third day, when I got home, I received a return visit service from the hotel. The caller was an employee named eleven eleven. Attitude is also very good.
Chunda Renaissance, I will come again next month(^_^)v

There are only two bottles of free mineral water in the room and they are not in the refrigerator. The elevator is too slow. It is too far from the lobby to the elevator. There is no one to remind you from the front desk to the elevator. Where is the elevator? You can only walk forward slowly. When ordering takeout, no one will deliver it. Is this a five-star hotel? A hotel costing more than 600 yuan is worse than just finding a hotel.

Booked two rooms, one parent-child and one standard room. Overall it is very good. Although the parent-child room does not have a slide like the little yellow duck and big-billed monkey, the small darts also make the children have a lot of fun. The swimming pool is great, there is a small hot water massage facility, and there are not too many people during the festival. The buffet is good and has everything you need. The room service staff are very polite. During the day we went to the nearby Century Park to play very well. Just one point, the hotel room rate fluctuates up and down, and the gap between parent-child rooms is even higher. All in all, I am very satisfied, and I will choose the past when I have the opportunity.

msg:The hotel near the company is also the most favorite hotel for company guests to stay in Shanghai. I booked a hotel for the guest on Saturday. I suddenly wanted to book myself and try to stay for one night. Only then did I finally understand why the guest liked it. Although it is an old hotel, the overall sense of luxury is not inferior. More importantly, from the lobby manager, the front desk, the room service, the restaurant, such as Eleven, Henry, Johnny, Aurora, Adella, Carmel, etc., all make the guests feel at home and feel like spring breeze, and respond promptly and properly. Being decent and generous is a real warmth and comfort.

msg:A perfect experience! Renaissance quality as always! The room is very comfortable, just in time for the typhoon and fireworks to land in the past two days, I can't go out for a long time, and staying in the room to watch the Olympics doesn't feel boring. Special thanks to Ms. Aily who assisted in the check-in. Not only was she patient and enthusiastic, but she also found relevant colleagues to help me answer the restrictions on foreign cars in Shanghai in detail, which solved my big problem. Absolutely five-star praise👍

There is also a large swimming pool. After exercise, the sauna is very comfortable. The hotel staff Henry Johnny Roland Ella Adella Carmel are great. Hope to do it again.

The hotel is fully equipped with swimming pool and gymnasium, and breakfast is also very good. It's a 15-minute walk from the Shanghai Science and Technology Museum, and a large shopping mall is at the back. The location is excellent.

msg:Hotel location: very convenient, very close to Line 2 and Line 9, and also very close to the Science and Technology Museum, which is convenient for travel.

Room facilities: I can't help but complain, there is no standard of a five-star hotel at all. The front desk helped us upgrade the guest room, but we did not enjoy the specifications.
    First, the air conditioner blows directly at the head of the bed. The hotel sent someone from the engineering depar**ent to take care of it, but it didn't help. The wind continued to blow toward the pillows. Unless the bed was moved, it could not be improved. After sitting on the head of the bed for a while, I started to have a headache.
    Secondly, curtains are not very good at blocking light. No matter how you pull it, the part of the curtain against the wall always leaks light, and it is woken up by the outside light every morning, not naturally.
    Furthermore, there are too few TV channels, and children are not taken into consideration.

Breakfast: There are more varieties and good taste.

即便住在同一板塊，偶爾來酒店過個週末，也是挺不錯的選擇。周邊是高端居民區，商務和行政配套都很不錯，還遇到了因為備考入住的高中學子，加油吧年輕人！

酒店位置好，環境安靜。房間乾淨衞生。早餐在二樓中餐廳，品類豐富，中餐有豆腐花、煎餅果子、粥等，還有現場製作的麪、米粉、餛飩。西式、日式早餐也很不錯。就餐環境也很好。非常值得推薦的酒店。

ホテルに到着したとき、スタッフの皆さんがとても親切で、チェックインの手続きもスムーズでした。フロントデスクの対応が迅速で、気持ちよくスタートを切ることができました。

部屋に入ると、広々としていて清潔感がありました。モダンなデザインで、快適に過ごせるように配慮されているのが感じられました。ベッドも大変寝心地がよく、ぐっすり眠ることができました。

朝食はビュッフェスタイルで、種類が豊富でした。和洋中とバラエティに富んだ料理が並んでいて、どれも美味しかったです。特に、フレッシュな果物と焼きたてのパンは絶品でした。

ホテルの施設も充実していて、フィットネスセンターやプールを利用しました。どちらも清潔で、設備が整っていて快適でした。仕事の後にリラックスできる環境が整っているのは嬉しかったです。

立地も良く、地下鉄の駅からも近いため、市内観光やビジネスの移動にも便利でした。周囲にはレストランやショッピングモールもあり、食事や買い物にも困りませんでした。

全体的に、ルネッサンス上海浦東ホテルは快適で便利な滞在先でした。スタッフのサービス、部屋の快適さ、そして充実した施設に大変満足しました。また上海に来る際には、ぜひ再度宿泊したいと思います。
