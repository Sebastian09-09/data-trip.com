msg:It was the most outstanding stay at this elegant hotel. The room was stunning, comfortable and well decorated. We loved the thoughtful and personalized anniversary decor on the bed, cards and bubbles. A special thank you to Paolo and the team. The delicious and decadent cake we ordered from the bakery was absolutely delicious. All the staff were professional, friendly and made our experience phenomenal. The afternoon tea, cocktails and light dinner at the club were delectable and so enjoyable. Can't wait to return for another awesome staycation at The Regent.

msg:I had a wonderful stay with my little one.
The staff were very attentive from the moment we arrived and so patient when I had an issue checking in.
My daughter also took part in a cake decorating class during our stay and she thoroughly enjoyed.
The pool was quite large for hotels in Beijing, and the gym met  needs.
Yael on the front desk, Andy for in room dining, Paolo and the team at Dacappo restaurant made our stay comfortable down to the last detail. The breakfast had enough choice, and the in-room dining portions were generous.
We will be recommending to friends, but will also come back again 😃

msg:I think the up in Regent Hotel is only the service in two restaurants (Daccapo Italian Restaurant and Jinbao 99), we had a course dinner in Daccapo, and Hotpot set in Jinbao 99. The service and atmosphere in Daccapo were fine, and the taste of the foods was amazing, especially the buns and desserts,(but the so-called Boston lobster linguine with truffle was not worth it as added RMB $150). Also, the buffet breakfast was great in JinBao 99(the Hotpot set for dinner was just fair I think), all of the food was not bad, and the service was good, especially the supervisor Ms Doreen, who is friendly and talkative. Hopefully, they can keep it on.
The downs are the rooms, and the services in reception, swimming pool and lobby. The room was quite outdated, and the most unacceptable and super crazy was you couldn't adjust the room temperature to below 24 Celsius, really hot and stuffy, and we couldn't sleep well all the nights we stayed, though opened up the windows(I never opened up the windows in a hotel until this time), but we didn't know where the heating comes from, still keeps warm and stuffy. Also, we called for one more chair, and they sent a chair which was quite filthy, with all the dust in it(you can see the pics). The service in lobby reception and the pool was poor, they had "bad face" all the time, no smiles, to be honest, the pool itself is not bad, but some people who use the pool which is not the hotel guest and no service in the pool and wellness area.  Also, we talked to the lobby receptionist about the problems in the room, she said they would sort it out for us but finally they did nothing about it, obviously, she lied to us. 
When we checked out, I told the manager about this, she said all the hotels in Beijing are the same regarding the heating problem, but I want to tell her, it doesn't, at least Four Seasons doesn't. And the room is much better than the Regent Hotel.
All in all, just fair, not the global 5-star standard, hopefully, they can rebuild or renew the rooms, and improve the services.

Chinese from Google Translate:
我覺得麗晶飯店的亮點只有兩家餐廳的服務（達卡波義大利餐廳和金寶99），我們在達卡波吃了套餐，在金寶99吃了火鍋套餐。達卡波的服務和氛圍都還不錯，味道也不錯食物很棒，尤其是麵包和甜點，（但所謂的松露波士頓龍蝦扁麵條不值得，因為要加人民幣150元）。 另外，金寶99的自助早餐很棒（晚餐的火鍋套餐我覺得還算可以），所有的食物都不錯，服務也很好，特別是主管Doreen女士，很友好，很健談。 希望他們能夠繼續下去。
缺點是房間以及接待處、游泳池和大廳的服務。 房間相當陳舊，最不能接受和超級瘋狂的是房間溫度無法調節到24攝氏度以下，真的又熱又悶，我們住的每一晚都睡不好，儘管開著窗戶（我從來沒有在酒店裡打開過窗戶，直到這次），但我們不知道暖氣是從哪裡來的，仍然溫暖而悶熱。 另外，我們又要了一張椅子，他們送來了一張很髒的椅子，裡面滿是灰塵（你可以看照片）。 大廳接待和泳池的服務很差，一直“臭臉”，沒有笑容，說實話，泳池本身還不錯，但有些人使用泳池不是酒店客人，沒有泳池和健身區的服務。 另外，我們和大廳接待員討論了房間的問題，她說他們會幫我們解決，但最後他們什麼也沒做，顯然，她對我們撒了謊。
退房的時候，我跟經理說了這件事，她說北京所有飯店的暖氣問題都是一樣的，但我想告訴她，不是，至少四季不是。 而且房間比麗晶酒店好很多。
總而言之，只是公平，不是全球五星級標準，希望他們能夠重建或更新房間，並改善服務。

msg:Absolutely amazing time here and so much of it was thanks to the most amazing person ever - Paolo. Before I even checked in the bell hop helped me with the luggage and check in was so smooth. Everyone was so welcoming and warm that I immediately felt happy and bubbly. The room was so thoughtfully prepared to welcome me on my birthday and to make me feel special. There was even a small cake, a fruit platter, and a personalized card. I was absolutely blown away by the level of personalized care and attention to detail. We had some tea at the executive lounge and again were welcomed and had great service. Paolo arranged for some more personalized touches for my birthday party in the lounge including Barbie themed photos on the appetizers and bite sized snacks. He was able to help us with the theme of the birthday party ~ Barbie by designing four different pink cocktails including a gin tonic style drink and a bubbly prosecco based one. We also had the breakfast buffet which had a great selection of food and was separated from the dining tables which was appreciated to better enjoy the food. I really liked the noodle and soup station in the morning especially as it was raining. The butterfly brunch was lovely and very fulfilling. I have nothing but an endless number of positive things to say about my sumptuous room with mesmerizing views and tremendous service. I love staycations and I have to say that this one takes the cake. Thank you all!

msg:They have connecting room. However, you will need to inform house keeping each time to have it opened or close. It’s a bit troublesome but I I guess for the safety of the guest it is it. The drinks in the fridge are free for 1st refill. This information was not shared during check in. Was informed by the house keeper during their daily routine cleaning. Lastly, the hotel provided free wifi as well and again this was not mentioned during check in. Had to call and ask the receptionist to check it out.
Overall the stay was good and if the receptionist/check in staff could explain and elaborate facilities of the hotel would be excellent. Please improve on this.

I booked a winter package deal which included afternoon tea and evening snacks and drinks. Very good value for money. The pool area is also suitable for young children, including my 6 month old daughter. i liked the extra touches that made the stay extra special, such as the teddy bear for my daughter, free drinks in the minibar, and fruit delivered to the room. I am quite disappointed there's no free parking at the hotel though. It came as quite a surprise to find the underground parking fee was ¥267 for staying overnight.

msg:Let me start with the good things: the hotel is very clean. Although it is a bit old, it can be seen that it is carefully maintained. The cleaning lady is very kind, and most of the service staff are very polite, which is the consistent excellent standard of InterContinental.
Let's talk about the most disgusting thing: when we checked in, an "experienced" front desk received us and arranged a "special" room for us. I didn't know the situation at the time and I thanked her enthusiastically. Unexpectedly, the nigh**are of four days and three nights began...
This is a room separated from the next room by only one door, and the sound insulation is 0. We can clearly hear any conversation in the next room, so we try not to make any noise in the room to avoid disturbing the next door.
As a result, on the second day, the neighbor next door moved in with a more emotional mood. He kept speaking impassionedly and angrily expressing his opinions on various attractions. He kept talking during our nap and until two o'clock in the morning. He couldn't stop until we called to complain. We completely lost sleep, and we were tired and in a bad mood when visiting attractions during the day.
On the third day, the hotel sent us a fruit plate after we complained. The excited neighbor next door was replaced with a more gentle guest after checking out, but we could still hear each other's whispers. At night, the neighbor coughed, and we felt like we were in the same space.
It is worth thinking whether such a room is suitable for family customers or for high-rise customers. I think if there is a next time, I will definitely not make such a choice again.

I did a lot of homework online before coming to Beijing, and finally chose Regent. It turned out that the choice was very correct. The location of Regent Hotel is excellent. It is right next to Dengshikou subway station, which is convenient for going everywhere. The hotel lobby is grand and luxurious, accompanied by piano music, which made us feel very satisfied as soon as we entered the door. As for the service, every waiter I met was polite and kind, and the service was proactive and enthusiastic. I especially praised a gentleman named Zhang Shaohua. The hotel room was clean and tidy, and I was very satisfied. Our package included a meal at the Italian restaurant De Carbo on the second floor.

msg:It was my first time staying at Regent Beijing. I stayed there for two days. The hotel facilities are indeed a bit old, but I was satisfied with the service, from the welcome to open the car door, the front desk check-in upgrade, the room do not disturb, the room cleaning service, the midnight snack at 3 o'clock, the welcome fruit, the daily free drinks in the mini bar, the lobby bar food, these service details are difficult to be fully achieved by many hotels of the same level, but Regent has done them all. Of course, there are some minor flaws, such as the water pressure in the shower room of the room is not strong enough, the TV channels are few and the signal is not good and cannot be rotated, but they are all acceptable. The arrogant and perfunctory attitude of the steak house operator made me decide to eat at the lobby bar. However, the flaws do not outweigh the merits. Next time I come to Wangfujing, I will stay at Regent again.

msg:The first sight when the car came down was very impressive. The Aston Martin showroom was on the first floor. The staff at the door came over to help open the door and take the luggage. There were people picking us up and escorting us to the front desk. ￼
The lobby smelled fragrant when we entered it. There were many staff members. Although some of the staff at the door were a little older, they were really energetic and attentive.
Because of the holidays, I wanted to stay in a suite. There were too many hotels around. This one was definitely the most cost-effective. After a moment of hesitation, the suite was gone, but it was enough for a family of three. The room was cleaned very cleanly and the shower water was also very large. This is really important when staying in a hotel. The only shortcoming was that the bed and pillow were a little soft. I didn't know that the hotel had a variety of pillows to choose from. I didn't know until I checked out. The service staff on the floor were also very serious. They would say hello every time they passed by and ask if there were any clothes that needed to be washed. They were really thoughtful.
There are many snacks around the hotel. It is also very close to Wangfujing. There are subways and buses. It is really convenient. There are also various well-known alleys and old Beijing courtyards. You can spend a day or two strolling around.
All in all, I was very satisfied with this stay!

The location is also convenient, the service is also standard five-star level, the breakfast is rich, and the front desk and restaurant lobby service staff are all good! I was impressed by a Shanxi girl named Mi in the gym and a student from Southwest University of Political Science and Law at the front desk. The piano music in the lobby is nice. I reported to the front desk that there was no problem with shoe cloth and hanging swimsuits. They said that they could help arrange it next time if I told them in advance. It's worth staying! Of course, the problem of rising house prices during holidays is probably the same for all hotels.

The front desk was full of people and I had to queue up to get the room card. At 9:30 a.m. on the day of check-out, the waiter knocked on the door and asked if he needed to do laundry and clean the room. Didn't the waiter know what day the customer was checking out? Before checking out, I knocked on the door and asked if I wanted to clean the room. Overall service is a bit stiff. There is also something that has dried on the toilet wall like snot for a long time, and there are stains on the bathroom glass.

Breakfast, Italian restaurant dinner, and hot pot dinner set are all delicious, and the service staff are also very good. During this period, my wife had a bad stomach. Wang Xin, the duty manager, was very helpful and solved the problems of the air conditioner in the room and the drain holes in the bathroom. She continued to care about her afterwards and was very considerate. Good location, good service, highly recommended. I will stay here again next time I go to Beijing~

The hotel room was not cleaned well and there were candies on the floor after changing rooms.

The sockets are unreasonable. There is only one socket at the head of the bed, and the other side is far away from the head of the bed. It is impossible to charge while lying down and playing with your mobile phone.

But the service was very attentive, and a small cake was given as a gift on New Year's Eve. Traveling is also very convenient, with subway lines 5 and 8 nearby. It is also within walking distance from Wangfujing.

msg:Location: The hotel is in a very good location. Dengshikou subway station is just downstairs, and it is conveniently located near Wangfujing attractions and commercial areas.

Catering: The breakfast is quite satisfactory. The variety and quality are good. It has both Chinese and Western styles. It is worth recommending.

Service: The staff are pretty good, enthusiastic and professional.

Facilities: It's a bit old and the hardware needs to be upgraded. After entering the elevator and swiping the card for a long time but no response, I realized that I needed to insert the card. The TV in the room could at least be replaced with a mosaic quality one. There are also advantages. The even-numbered room I stayed in can see the Forbidden City. The large floor-to-ceiling glass is comfortable.

Overall satisfied, it was a comfortable stay. When I checked out, I learned that our family was on vacation, and we gave the children a commemorative pen and a bottle of red wine.

By the way, I walked through the back door of the hotel and there was a longfang bar next door. I had a few cocktails and was very satisfied.

The room is large and has floor-to-ceiling glass, which is very convenient for overlooking the Wangfujing street scene. There is also a bathtub where you can take a soak during a day trip. The room is not small, so it doesn't feel crowded when you bring your children. The service attitude of the hotel is very good. The breakfast and room attendants are very enthusiastic. The front desk foreman Xu Mengqi and the front desk Yan Zixin and Wang Yuqing are very considerate. They store luggage and look after the children attentively.

The simple white porridge, served with pickled mustard and salted duck eggs, was even as carefully arranged as the order, which moved me inexplicably.

There was a slight hiccup at the beginning when I went to stay this time because I was not satisfied with the room, but it was quickly solved by the front desk help. The receptionist also took me to see the room several times. He took the trouble and his attitude is worthy of praise.
Overall, I am very satisfied with it and it is more suitable for business trips.

msg:Traveling with children during winter vacation. Before coming to Beijing from Shanghai, I did some planning. Because I wanted to be closer to Tiananmen Square, I chose a hotel within a 5-kilometer radius. On the first day I arrived in Beijing, I stayed in another hotel for 1,300+, which was very unsatisfactory. I won’t go into the details and decided to change hotels. After choosing this hotel, from entering the store to the front desk and every staff member, they are in very good spirits and have professionalism. We stayed for two consecutive nights and then stayed for two more days. We originally wanted to go to Universal Studios instead, but this place is really great, the price is reasonable, and the price-performance ratio is very high. The subway is right at the door. You can also take the subway directly to Universal Studios. It was very comfortable, so I decided to continue living here. The afternoon tea and dinner included in the package are also very good. The overall feeling of the hotel is that the leadership has ideas, the management has methods, and the grassroots staff are well-educated. I am very satisfied. I will choose here again when I come to Beijing in the future.

msg:It was my first time to stay at Regent in Beijing. When I was doing my guide, the most impressive thing was the hotel's service. Although I only experienced it for one night, I really felt that the hotel gave guests a good experience of being at home.
This time is my parents’ wedding anniversary, so I came to Beijing with them. I contacted the reservation depar**ent by phone before checking in. When I asked if they could help with the decoration, the hotel staff said they would help with the decoration and offered to help me arrange a room on a high floor with a good view. When checking in, there will be a concierge at the door to help open the door and pick up the luggage from the moment you get off the car, and deliver it all the way to the room. But the moment I opened the door, I was a little disappointed. Except for two pillowcases, the room was nothing special. But later, I recalled that I did not make it clear when I communicated with the reservation staff in the early stage. By default, it would be arranged as a small surprise for my parents when I checked in. Of course, this little incident was resolved very well by the hotel staff, who even gave me a cute little bear as a gift.
The overall hotel facilities are well maintained. The room is very comfortable to sleep in. I like the toiletries and the fragrance of magnolia is elegant and pleasant. I also experienced afternoon tea and happy hour in the executive lounge. The scenery on the 17th floor is beautiful. It has its own characteristics during the day and night. There are not many types of afternoon tea and the taste is average. I personally prefer a simple meal in the evening. The hotel's breakfast is quite rich in variety and tastes good, and the fruits are particularly delicious. I will come to Lijing next time I come to Beijing!

The location is great. You can get there just around the corner from the subway station without having to cross the road.
There is a Starbucks just downstairs, a must for coffee lovers.
The service in the Hong Kong-style restaurant on the third floor is super good, and the steamed food is delicious and exquisite.
The swimming pool on the fifth floor is large and warm, and it also has a hot soaking pool. The locker room also has a soaking pool and a wet and dry steaming swimsuit dehydrator.
My baby unexpectedly had a fever, so I asked the front desk to borrow a wheelchair and push it to the Union Medical College Hospital opposite. They also helped arrange a late check-out until three o'clock.

Breakfast: The dishes are almost the same every day, but the waiters are very proactive in refilling the coffee and clearing the plates. Five-star praise

Overall, I'm very satisfied. It's a good place to stay with children. The hotel is just outside Dengshikou Station of Metro Line 5. It's within walking distance of Wangfujing Intime Lego and within walking distance of Four Seasons Minfu. The oversized floor-to-ceiling windows allow you to live on the sunny side and have a panoramic view of sunrise and sunset. My seven-year-old son said it must be a five-star hotel and he likes it very much.

It is not worthy of a five-star hotel and it ranks second in Ctrip's comprehensive evaluation. I booked a hotel for a total of 4 days. There were drinks and fruits in the refrigerator when I entered on the first day, but they were not available on the second day. I called the front desk on the evening of the 20th and a manager on duty replied that drinks and fruits were welcome items. , they are only given on the first day. To be honest, what are these things worth? It is estimated that they add up to more than 10 yuan, but my room rate is more than 1,000 per day, and the price is the same for 4 days. Why are they only given on the first day? It's really strange, and the slippers were only available on the first day. I continued to wear the old slippers the next day. It's really admirable. This kind of hotel management and service level can have so many praises. Maybe it's because I, a southerner, are too demanding. . Just a tip, if you come here for consecutive stays (within 7 days, and there are two people), you can consider using different people to book rooms every day, so that you can enjoy the "high-quality" service of new customers every day.

I thought the hotel also has a direct airport bus connection (I found out after asking about the epidemic that the epidemic stopped a few years ago). If you take a taxi to the hotel, the concierge and hotel front desk will provide good service, and the room layout is OK. The heating is OK, and the room and floor have a wide view; the cleaning lady provides enough water and drinks every day. It takes about 20 minutes to walk from the hotel to the Forbidden City (the Forbidden City area is closed and buses do not stop). To watch the flag-raising, you can take the subway Dengshikou C and transfer to Line 1, get off at Wangfujing, and walk to the square for about 10 minutes (No. 1 before and after the flag-raising time) The subway does not stop to drop off passengers at Tiananmen Station, and the subway can only be used one hour after the flag-raising time). There are many hotels of different levels and prices around the hotel, as well as many commercial centers. Wangfujing Macau Center Intime APM is not far away. There are many dining options and there is a queue for meals... The overall impression of Regent this time was okay, not as bad as the low-scoring reviews I saw before said.

msg:Beijing Regent is well-deserved for its reviews. It has a superior location and always thinks more about its guests. There are unexpected surprises every day. This time I also upgraded to a room type that faces the Forbidden City side. The overall stay experience is quite satisfactory. Except for the slightly early decoration, the overall service level is worthy of Regent's signature. The breakfast options are higher than many hotels of the same level. I will visit again in the future when I travel to Beijing.

msg:First stop hotel in Beijing on New Year’s Day~! Wangfujing Hotel is really great! I’ve heard about Regent’s service early on.

Service: Praise~~~concierge, front desk, guest room~ staff in every aspect! They are all super nice!
The climate in Beijing is relatively dry, so we drank all the free water in the room the day before! 🤣I put a box away the next day! ! !
Even the charging cable will be carefully stored! It’s so thoughtful!

Hygiene: Overall very good! The facilities in the room are in very good condition! A hotel that has been open for so many years! This state is really amazing!


The location is unbeatable~! A few minutes walk to Wangfujing! Yo yo da da nice! I didn’t try the hotel breakfast this time! My baby’s stomach capacity is reserved for the bean juice burnt rings 😂 Fried liver buns, braised braised noodles and tea...!
Sure enough, such a high rating on Ctrip is not for nothing! The hotel does really well!

Service: The hotel service staff is very friendly. From check-in at the front desk, cleaning in the housekeeping depar**ent to the lobby bar area, the service staff can be enthusiastic and proactive. There is also mulled wine in the lobby bar, which I think is very delicious.

Facilities: The room facilities are well maintained. Breakfast has a full range of varieties. Club members have a dedicated reception area leading to a dining area. The hot American I ordered was pretty good.

  The hotel's location is very convenient. It only takes 3 subway stops to reach Tiananmen, the Forbidden City, museums and other popular tourist destinations.
  Although it has been open for a long time, the hotel is well maintained and the room facilities and equipment are perfect.
  The breakfast is rich in variety. From the time you enter to the time you leave after the meal, the staff will call you by your last name and will take the initiative to help you with just a look.
  All in all, it is a hotel worth staying in when traveling to Beijing!

msg:Overall I am satisfied. The best thing is the service. There are many waiters in the lobby who can wave at any time to solve your requests. The attitude in all aspects is also good. Tell me something that can be improved. First of all, I grabbed a cheaper coupon before, but it didn't indicate in advance that the daily reservation room was limited. I made the reservation five days in advance and found that it was full, so I had to refund the coupon and book at the original price. Secondly, the sound insulation is a flaw. After all, it is excusable for a hotel that opened in 2000. However, at 5 o'clock in the morning, foreigners singing next door, the sound of a huge vacuum cleaner upstairs rubbing the carpet and the sound of running water woke people up. For a hotel with more than 1,000 people per night, The room is indeed a bit too small. When I checked out, I reported it to the front desk, and they proactively gave me two cute bears as compensation. The advantage is that the fruit plate is really good and there is plenty of drinking water in the room. The downside is that the amount of water in the shower is really small, and takeaways cannot be delivered upstairs and have to go out to get them. DeKabo had come here to taste it alone before, but he didn’t need to do it this time. Overall it’s pretty good, I will consider it in the future (I love Martin so much, I’m really satisfied with the 4S store right next to it)

From check-in, dining to check-out, every step of the process provides sincerity, enthusiasm and thoughtfulness. The most impressive thing about the service was that the takeout was delivered to the wrong courier cabinet. A female waiter in the lobby went a long way to help pick it up at the hotel next door. There was also another waiter in the lobby, Liu Ming, whose service was very thoughtful and meticulous, which left a deep impression on me. Someone is always playing piano in the hotel lobby, which is a very traditional five-star experience! The breakfast is complete in variety, and the location of the guide is very thoughtful. They also proactively provide blankets to keep ladies warm, and proactively provide tea. The swimming pool is large and warm, but the room facilities are old and the place to hang clothes is very small.

We then called the front desk and a lady came forward and offered to give us extra bottles of water. . . (I have nothing to say about this kind of trea**ent) Later, the manager called me to deliver breakfast. I thought this unpleasant experience would be over.
On the second day after moving in, my family and I were still sleeping. The cleaning lady knocked on the door and walked in without waiting for my response. It felt like there was no privacy at all.
The trip was over. On the high-speed train back, I received a call from an unknown manager of your hotel. He apologized to me and mentioned that he would contact her next time he came to Beijing and she could give me a room upgrade. He told me to add me as vx, next. contact. But two days have passed, and no one has added me to vx. May I ask? Who would stay in this hotel next time they come to Beijing?

Just in time for the Belt and Road Conference, foreign guests also stayed here. The hotel was peaceful and warm. We were also blessed and noble, and our families were very happy. I am full of happiness to be born in China, and wish our great motherland prosperity and strength!

msg:I deliberately chose a weekend in late autumn to come to Beijing to experience the "autumn in the old capital" described in the book. After several comparisons, I finally chose the Regent Hotel and stayed there for two days. Let me briefly talk about my experience of staying at the hotel and give it as a reference for future travelers:
1. The hotel is in an excellent location. After exiting the Dengshikou subway station, walk two steps to the left and you will reach the main entrance. I even wondered if the subway passed downstairs of the hotel. In a big city like Beijing, you must choose a hotel close to the subway entrance. It is really convenient.
2. The hotel service facilities are first-rate, the staff are well-trained, the rooms are clean and hygienic, the space is sufficient, and the bedding is comfortable and soft. A light sleeper like me can fall asleep easily.
3. I stayed in a room on the 18th floor. The view was very good. I could see far out the floor-to-ceiling window. It’s just that the price of 2,000+ per night is a bit expensive. It would be better if it could be a little more friendly to the people. In addition, the soundproofing of the room is not very good. You can hear the sound of a father scolding his child in the next room at night. Fortunately, it didn't last too late or too long.
4. The hotel buffet is priced at 288 yuan per person, which I personally feel is not cost-effective. I regret a little bit that I ordered the one with double breakfast. The dishes are relatively rich, but I really don’t think any of the dishes are particularly delicious.
5. A special reminder to Ctrip friends that Ctrip members do not have the right to delay check-out, only InterContinental members have the right.
Finally, Beijing is really crowded with people. There are people everywhere you go.

msg:The location is very good, very close to the subway station. The hotel has a lot of security, and the service staff and chefs are also very good. However, the room should be dark. On the first day of the strong wind warning in Beijing, cold wind blew directly into the room and the temperature control did not work at all. , it didn’t work even if it was turned off. The heater that was sent in the middle of the night made a lot of noise, and it was cold again when it was turned off. I didn’t fall asleep until about two o’clock in the morning. On the first day in Beijing, I quickly took the medicine I ordered at midnight, but I was still cold. As a result, I no longer have the energy to play in subsequent trips. Except for this problem with facilities and equipment, everything else is really good. I think the central air conditioning can be handled flexibly by the project. The temperature in Beijing is already 9 degrees, there is a strong wind warning, and cold wind is still blowing in the room, which is a bit unreasonable😓

This time they stayed in two rooms for three days. It was still very convenient to eat, drink and play. The hotel service was also very considerate.

There is no air conditioning in the current season and the sound insulation is not good. The waiters are very enthusiastic but they will force you not to wear slippers into the restaurant (the children were in the swimming pool the day before). I bruised my feet and wore slippers to the restaurant). The only consolation is that the swimming pool has a bathroom, so you don't have to go into the room wet.

It is a good place to get quiet in the bustle. It is next to Exit C of Line 5. There is also a Zan bus that looks like it can go to the Great Wall. The environment, hygiene and service are all impeccable. The swimming pool is also clean. The staff always pays attention to and reminds guests of precautions. Safety management is in place. I believe the breakfast ingredients are carefully prepared. There are small bottles of imported jams with four flavors on each table. The cute food specially prepared for children and the little corner for taking meals are worthy of praise for the details. This time I spent most of my time visiting the attractions. I hope I can spend more time next time to fully enjoy the hotel's services.

msg:1. The location of the hotel is very good. It is about 700 meters away from Wangfujing. There are various high-end hotels here. The location of Regent is quiet in the bustle, but it is also very easy to find at the intersection. If the price per night is usually around 1,000, More is still okay. The price during the National Day holiday was more than 2,000 yuan. The original reservation for three nights without breakfast was more than 6,000 yuan. Because our child is 12 years old and we want an extra bed, the front desk recommended us to upgrade to a suite when we checked in. We received breakfast for three days and an extra bed for free. If the plan was feasible, we upgraded.
        2. In terms of room hardware: The two bedrooms and two bathrooms in the suite are enough for three people. If two mother and son pairs of close friends are traveling together, this room choice is also a good value for money, because living together will be lively. The room has large floor-to-ceiling glass windows and no balcony. It has sufficient lighting and slightly poor ventilation (negligible). The bathroom equipment is a bit old. The toilet flip is not damped. It makes a loud sound when it is flipped down. It makes people jump every time. The large bathroom sink does not drain. It's relaxing, but very big. There is a comfortable pool where my son can take a comfortable bath and watch TV. It's a great way to relieve fatigue.
        Finally, I would like to praise the staff service. From the entrance to the front desk reception to the housekeeping aunt, everyone is very friendly, professional and polite. There are many types of breakfast area, and there is also a special food area for Xiaobao, which is very humane. We were going to the Great Wall the next day and it was relatively early at 7 o'clock. The front desk reminded us that we could pack breakfast. Overall rating: 9 points. (If the bathroom is upgraded with a washlet, I will be very satisfied).

msg:Facilities: The room card is super difficult to use, and I am very satisfied with the rest. Although it opened relatively early, the facilities and hygiene inside are very good.

Hygiene: Auntie cleans very carefully

Environment: So-so, relatively quiet but with an average view. I ordered a high-rise garden view and it feels average.

Welcome fruit gift: I didn’t get it, but I got a box of mooncakes, which was okay.

Service: The service is pretty good, maintaining my consistent good impression of Regent!
But maybe it’s because of the preconceived impression of Chongqing Regent, it’s really much different! Chongqing Regent has a lot of delicious food in the mini-fridge, and the hotel noticed that I like to eat a certain snack, so they even expressly delivered a box to me when I returned to Shanghai! ! Although Beijing Regent is also very nice, it is still a little behind compared to Chongqing. It does not have delicious food and the layout of the rooms is not very good, but it is very good compared to other hotels of the same level! And the guys and girls at the front desk are very good-looking, hahaha. A happy journey~

At the end of the four-day parent-child tour, what I want to say is that every time I stay at the Regent Hotel, I will have a pleasant surprise. Rich fruits every day and drinks in the minibar are very popular with children. This time I ate delicious chocolates at the hotel. Before I left, I planned to go to the food hall on the first floor to buy some and take them home. Unfortunately, I missed the high-speed rail when I left. I will only taste it next time. The location, the warm and thoughtful service of the staff all make our passengers very satisfied! see you later!

When I brought my two daughters to check in, I immediately gave three coupons. This touched me very much! Thumbs up for the beautiful woman who checked me in that day (I’m very sorry that I didn’t remember the beautiful woman’s name)! The handsome guy at the lobby bar is also great. Although he may not have had time to try the food I asked about, he will also be very enthusiastic to find answers for me! I just hope that when the room service sees that there are 3 of us checking in, they can replenish the supplies for 3 people in time. This will make it more perfect. Overall, I am still very, very satisfied! The Regent team is really great!

Every day, you can see the dust on the table top of the prominent cabinet that has not been wiped. The hygiene was slightly better on the 9th and 10th. Except for the hardware, which is a bit regretful, everything else feels very good.

Considering the transportation in Beijing, the subway should be the best choice. At the same time, Wangfujing is just a few hundred meters away, so eating and shopping are not too convenient. .
Let’s talk about the hotel’s service. You can feel their service even before you enter the door. The young man or uncle who opens the door to pick up the bag are very enthusiastic. The service staff in the guest room or breakfast are all smiling and proactively offering support. Unexpectedly There are also hotels with such service awareness in Greater Beijing.
Although the hotel was built early, all facilities and cleanliness are maintained very well.
Finally, let’s talk about the breakfast. It’s really of a high standard and delicious. There are also dedicated seats for seating, so you don’t have to worry about not being able to find a seat. It’s very orderly.

msg:Service: I am satisfied with the front desk. I have upgraded to a privilege room, and I can enjoy afternoon tea and dinner in the executive lounge. I am satisfied with the afternoon tea drinks, but the food and snacks are not very good. There are very few varieties and the taste is average. It is incomparable with the afternoon tea in the executive lounge of the same level. The price is expensive.

The service of the room logistics depar**ent is still very considerate, and the items needed can be met as much as possible.

Hardware facilities: I am very dissatisfied. It says that the room is 45 square meters.

The overall hardware lacks humanization and comfort in design. Now this kind of simple luxury that is not considered by people is outdated.

First, the sound insulation of the room is poor. At night, the neighbor next door can hear the phone calls clearly, and even sings, which woke up the children.

Second, there is no clothesline. After swimming, there is no place to hang the swimsuit. The waiter said that it can be hung on the doorknob. The water dripped all over the floor, so how to dry it.

Third, there is no trash can in the bathroom, and there is no place to put your mobile phone. There is no place to put your mobile phone in the bathroom. Throwing paper into the toilet is easy to drain slowly. Because the room is small and the bathroom space is small, you can't put anything there. You can tell that the room is small.

Fourth, the sewer in the shower room was blocked and overflowed, and it was repaired later. The sewer hole is very large, and the water makes a huge sound of flowing water like a waterfall. The child goes to bed early. I am worried that it will disturb the child. I put the reminder card next to the water outlet and the water flows The sound became smaller.

The overall feeling is that 2,000 yuan a night is not worth the price at all. I stayed for three nights in a row and will not come again. The price of this hotel is too low, I really don't recommend it.

How many times has it happened, why are you disobedient? Why are you playing the piano again? (It was the first time for my child to play). The child was frightened and did not dare to speak. When I saw this, I asked her to talk to the child in a friendly tone. Unexpectedly, she directly started to talk to me: Why am I unfriendly? That's all I said...then she turned around and walked over to another lobby attendant to complain, looking over at me as she spoke. I went directly to the front desk and complained to her. Although she later apologized to my child, she made excuses and said that she thought my child and another child were twins (just because they wore the same color clothes), so she spoke in that tone...really I once encountered a waitress in a five-star hotel with such poor attitude and quality...

Because it's too cold
The waiter next to me took the initiative to bring a shawl for my wife
It's a surprise this time
The front lobby bar restaurant and the aisle waiters are very enthusiastic
Next time you come to Beijing Lijing, it will definitely be your first choice!
Thank you~~~

The breakfast in the restaurant is not outstanding, but it maintains the standard of a five-star hotel, and the restaurant service is excellent. I was very impressed by the customer service. I stayed here for several days and there were small surprises every day, which was full of ritual.

  The afternoon tea set given as an administrative courtesy, the three small cakes on the top floor are okay, Si Kang is also good, and the milk flavor is quite strong. The sandwich in the middle layer is average.

  Happy hour, there is no problem with being full, but the variety is quite small, so you can eat whatever you want.

  The swimming pool is good, the children had a good time playing, and the water is not deep, only about 1.2 meters.

  Fruits are welcome, each one is sweet! There is enough water in the room, and the room view on the 19th floor is very good.

  The buffet breakfast is also quite rich in varieties, and the service is very good. There is a waiter at the entrance of the restaurant to greet you with a smile and polite words throughout the process. When we finished eating and went out to the door, the waiter greeted us warmly

  I will choose to live in Regent next time

msg:Every time I stay at Regent, I always come and go in a hurry, and I don’t have time to evaluate it. This time I will write a short essay to evaluate it. Regent Hotel is an old hotel. Although it opened early, it is well maintained. I like the location very much. It's a very advantageous location. The transportation is convenient and travel is convenient. I give it high marks for this. The hotel lobby is magnificent and very stylish. What I like most is to sit in the lobby bar all afternoon and listen to the piano in a daze. This time I stayed in a twin room and a suite. The suite size was up to standard, the facilities were good, the bedding was very comfortable, the room service was great, the response was positive and fast, the welcome fruits were in season, and there were different varieties every time I stayed. However, if you can cover it with plastic wrap after cleaning, the details will be extra points. The mattress in the twin room seems to be a bit old. It creaks when you turn over and is not very stable. It seems to be a bit drifting when you sleep on it. Walking through the hotel, the staff you encounter are all polite and smiling, making you feel at home. The staff at the concierge depar**ent in the lobby are also enthusiastic and answer all questions. During this stay, I also experienced a small incident: It happened to be a snowy day in Beijing, and I ordered a steaming takeout, but the takeout was not allowed in. I very much understand the hotel’s intentions, but if the hotel doorman can proactively inform the takeaway staff and contact the guests, the hotel can definitely help deliver it to the room, so that a steaming hot takeout food will not be left outside the lobby in minus ten degrees Celsius weather. It was placed in the open air, and by the time you got it, it was already freezing cold, making it completely inedible. Although I gave a tip later and asked the staff to help deliver it to the room, the service was still lacking in details and needed to be improved. The hotel's breakfast buffet is not outstanding, with a relatively single variety and a lack of Beijing specialty foods. There is no rice noodle stall at the Ming Dang Noodle stall if you want to take a bite. The products produced by Bai An do not look good and feel a bit unsuitable for the price of breakfast. The whole stay was quite pleasant, Regent will always be ranked first in my heart! Will stay here next time!

Environment: The hotel room is very quiet, there is a piano performance in the lobby, and it is very close to the subway station. This is still very important for people visiting Beijing.
Facilities: I live in a club big bed room, the mattress is good and comfortable. The floor of the toilet was helped to lay three large pieces of floor towels, and it made people feel very comfortable when they walked in. The layout is also okay, sitting on a recliner, making a cup of capsule coffee, watching the scenery outside the large floor-to-ceiling windows, it is still very comfortable.
Disadvantages: There is a fly in the oin**ent suggestion that must be mentioned. It is recommended to change the toilet. The momentum is small, and it will swell when flushed. This is really not in line with the positioning of this hotel.

The location is very good, the subway is downstairs, the peninsula is diagonally opposite, and there are many restaurants around. The most important thing is that although the decoration of the hotel is old, it is well maintained and detailed in all aspects They are all good. It can be seen that the management is very good at ordinary times. The staff are enthusiastic and professional in service. They even gave a pen before leaving. I will choose to stay next time I go to Beijing.

msg:Booked a luxurious suite, the front desk upgraded the suite for free, staying for two days was very comfortable
I have stayed in almost all luxury hotels in Beijing. This time I wanted to stay in the executive room of InterContinental Sanlitun, but it was 520, so I was not sure. After a round of choices, Regent's afternoon tea attracted me. After all, the room was much cheaper, so I didn't have much expectations, but from the time I checked in to when I left, it was amazing.
The toiletries in the room are very useful. When I checked in at 8 o'clock, the turndown bed was already turned on, and the bathroom floor was covered with floor towels. The room was well equipped and cleaned very clean. The minibar is free for the first time.
The sound insulation is good and needs to be strengthened. The pillow menu is very complete. There are lavender pillows. I am happy~
The hotel's service attitude is very good. The doorman is very winking. He takes the initiative to drive the door to carry the suitcase and bag, and politely introduces it to the room. Warm service at all times.
I went down to get takeout, and the hotel management (three Europeans) were standing by the door chattering, and I heard them saying "yeah we should do more to please our guests". They are not condescending, and what they are talking about is also the idea of serving customers. This is the attitude that the service industry should have!
The waitresses at breakfast were very enthusiastic, they helped press the elevator and guided them to their seats. My throat was uncomfortable. The waitress noticed it at breakfast on the first day and offered to give me freshly squeezed pear juice. The next day she still remembered that my throat was uncomfortable, so she took the initiative to bring pear juice, and took the initiative to pack a glass. Really warm but not overdone, comfortable without being intrusive.
The breakfast at the hotel is delicious, the cream cheese is great, there are all kinds of eggs (poached eggs benedict, scrambled eggs and omelettes) I am really happy, the breakfast quality is also very good, the yogurt small bottles are very fresh, vegetables tasty.
Due to temporary errands, I didn't have afternoon tea at Regent. It's a pity that I will fly from Beijing to Singapore in July. I will definitely come to Regent again to try the famous afternoon tea.

If you're not in a hurry, you can take a leisurely walk to the Forbidden City, which is just three subway stops away from Tiananmen Square.

Breakfast: Rich. It is not suitable for any child over 6 years old. It is a little unfriendly to my child who is under 1.2m and does not eat much. It is a bit expensive.

The breakfast on the second floor has a good environment and the service is very attentive. Especially on the day of my return, because the plane was delayed, I mentioned it to the service staff. The concierge received a response in less than 2 minutes. william (the Chinese name seems to be Minwei, sorry I have a bad memory) was very enthusiastic to help us extend the check-out time, and my father expressed his satisfaction. The only regret is that I don't have time to try the afternoon tea in the lobby. It looks so beautiful hahaha. I will choose to stay next time I come to Beijing.

The wall of the room will There is a wooden door directly connected to the next room, facing the big bed. I went to have breakfast at around 9:30 in the morning. The light above the elevator kept flashing and there was a loud strange sound. I was really worried about being hit. When I checked out, the front desk said We had to wait for the person in the row next to us to finish the check-out. She was new here and would not check out. Then the person who stored the luggage asked us after telling us the room number, does the hotel have a 19th floor? We confirmed to him three times that our room number was correct, but he still looked very doubtful. In the end, we had to show him the room card to prove that we had not reported the wrong room number. The hotel has a 19th floor, but the bellman felt normal. Not even an explanation. The location of the hotel is good. I can't think of anything else to praise, including the arrogant tone and aggressive attitude of the telephone interviewer. It's really hard to touch. I won't stay there a second time.

Manager Liu Hongjie arranged a birthday table for the child, and learned that the child has been thinking about a dish from their family. Although there was no such dish that day (the meal was random), he did find a way to let the kitchen do it alone. One (or deluxe version) was served with a very nice and delicious little cake at the end, thank you so much 🙏My daughter said that this year is the happiest birthday she has ever had 🎂Thanks to all the staff in the hotel, you are awesome👍👍 Regent Hotel is the first choice when you come to Beijing

The hostess for breakfast must lead a single guest to the small table at the back of the restaurant, which is still against the wall, which is also incomprehensible.
2. The concierge room service is very good. There was a small episode of early check-in, but it was resolved in time, which made people feel very comfortable.
3. The faucets and other facilities in the bathroom should be upgraded

msg:Let's put it this way, it's an old star hotel. It looks young and fashionable on the outside, but it's a bit old-fashioned to live in. It's really the location of the hotel that determines the price.
Service: The concierge service is very good, actively helping to open the door to take luggage, it is a good conscience to equip the room with mask disinfection wipes
Hardware: The decoration style of local hotels in the last century, the color is earthy and dim, and the overall feeling is dark when entering. No matter the lighting or decoration style, it looks depressing. Which ancient TV is the worst? There are different degrees of wear and tear, and the power supply of the desk and the head of the bed has been modified to directly install a wiring board for convenience. This operation is OK!
Hygiene: I don’t want to take a closer look, there is a towel with a long hair inside, 6
Catering: Not many types in general
In short, the price does not match the reality. The selling price must be worthy of the soft and hard quality of your products. Always relying on the geographical location is a one-shot deal. If it is not for the service, you can’t bear to give a bad review!

Called the waiter to change the trash can, but followed me, flushed the trash can with the sink, and poured the dirty water into the sink! I found the manager on duty and said that it was an upgrade to a room, which was not a bad review. I accepted. After all, everyone's work is not easy. I also stayed for one night, but the problem was the next day!
Service: Because Tiananmen Square, the Forbidden City, Temple of Heaven, etc. were arranged, I checked out early in the morning and stored my luggage in the lobby on the first floor! I came out of the Forbidden City in the afternoon and had dinner at 3 o'clock. I really had a broken leg, and I brought two children and the elderly. If you think about it, go back to the hotel and wait until 8:00 (the scheduled hotel pick-up is at 8:00). When you arrive at the hotel, you first ask if you can sit in the lobby and wait until 8:00. The old man and I fell asleep, and the manager of the lobby came to wake us up and told us to go to the nearby Wangfujing shopping mall to wait! Say yes! But can't sleep! This is the child's mood is not good! All kinds of irritability....I can't help it. I canceled the pick-up at 8 o'clock and changed it to 6 o'clock....I'm not a serious person, but the experience of Regent this time is really bad! Merchants can check the monitoring if they have any questions! ! !

msg:Very dissatisfied with the bar service on the first floor. While waiting for the bus, I took my children and ordered food at the bar. When the time came, after the baby's father went to check out, there was still a waiter holding the order and asking me to scan the QR code to pay. I was quite confused at the time, so I called the child's father to confirm, and he said that he had paid. When I took my children out to pick up the luggage, I realized that it turned out that their own POS machine did not issue the order (it seemed to be delayed, and the order was issued after a while), so they misunderstood that our payment was not successful. In this case, should you communicate clearly with the customer directly? What is the operation of taking an order out of nowhere and asking another person to pay? Does this mean I should pay twice? And it was inexplicable, and there was no clear communication at all. A waiter came over with the order, and I was still saying, didn’t dad pay for it? What kind of garbage service is this? The cups we soaked milk in in the previous room were not cleaned the next day. I don’t want to talk about this.

msg:I haven't traveled for three years, and I chose Beijing for the first match. The most important link and the biggest expense in the travel process should be the choice of hotel. Because I decided to come to Beijing temporarily, the hotel was booked late. After many considerations, I chose Beijing Regent Hotel. It is next to the subway station and it is convenient to travel. I thought that the high-end brand under InterContinental would not step on thunder. I stayed for four days, including two meals. The total cost of the lunch and dinner set and daily breakfast for two is 5,800 yuan. There is still something to say about the overall experience.
Disadvantages: 1. It was around 3:00 pm when I checked in. The front desk told me that the room hadn't been cleaned yet and I had to wait for 1-2 hours. If I needed to get the room immediately, I suggested that I pay to upgrade the room type. When it reached more than 400 yuan per day, I refused. If I considered the budget of about 2,000 yuan, I would directly book the Peninsula or Waldorf Astoria Hotel. The upgraded room type does not enjoy administrative benefits, and there are only double-bed rooms and no twin-bed rooms. Me and It was inconvenient for my son to check in, so the front desk asked me to sit and wait, which made my first experience very bad.
2. When I came back at night and got the room, there was no welcome fruit on the first day, no napkins in the room, only half a box of tissues on the sink in the bathroom, I needed to call to have the fruit and tissues delivered, and there was no trash can in the toilet, which was very inconvenient to use. I see that many people mentioned the disadvantages on the Internet, but the hotel is not willing to improve. When checking out, the front desk asked about any deficiencies. After telling them, the front desk replied that they would prepare some tissues for me next time I check in. Actually, this is not my personal need, it is all The basic needs of residents, who lives in a five-star hotel will bring their own napkins?
3. My set meal includes breakfast for two people. When I went to have breakfast two days ago, I was told by the food and beverage depar**ent that there was only one breakfast for one person. On the first day, I told them to verify it. On the second day, I still said that I only had one. When I told When it was two copies, the waiter who swiped the card in the food and beverage depar**ent told me that I should contact the front desk to modify it. This should be something that the two depar**ents of the hotel can directly verify and modify. It is really not professional enough to let the guests modify it by themselves. When I went to the front desk to inquire, the front desk said that there was no problem with the computer system records, and she would contact the food and beverage depar**ent, and finally did not question my meal count on the third day.
Advantages: 1. The hotel is still convenient to travel. Metro Line 5 is next to the hotel, and it can be reached within a 5-minute walk.
2. Most of the service attitudes of the hotel concierge, front desk, and food and beverage depar**ent are very kind. I hope to live a little higher, and the front desk is also satisfied. The floor-to-ceiling windows have a very good view.
3. The dinner set included in the package gave me an unexpected surprise, it was very delicious. I wasn't originally a fan of lasagne bolognese, but Dekabo's lasagne was so rich that it was worth a try. Desserts are also very good. My son changed the lobster pasta for extra money, and the lobster was also very fresh. The restaurant is not big, and the seats need to be reserved in advance. However, due to changes in my itinerary, I need to eat temporarily. The restaurant also helped me make adjus**ents to meet my needs. Thank you very much.
4. On the first day of staying in the hotel, I found that there was no clean hair on the edge of the sink. Because I have a slight cleanliness addiction, I felt uncomfortable. The next day, I went back to the room and found that the room was very clean. Even if I have a cleanliness, I can't fault it. I must give it a thumbs up. I stayed for four days in total, and the room cleaning was basically satisfactory.
5. The hotel is very generous with drinking water. Seven or eight bottles are placed every day. Beijing is dry, which is very necessary. There is coffee capsules in the room but I didn't use it, I drank coffee at breakfast every day. There are Coke, orange juice and beer in the freezer, which are also free to drink. Although I don't drink these, the experience for the guests is very good.
6. The hotel's breakfast is also okay. Although my son feels that there are not many varieties, I think it is basically enough. Except for the oolong incident of swiping the card at the entrance of the restaurant two days ago, which made me unhappy, the service staff of other restaurants are very proactive and kind.
If the hotel can improve the details, it should get better and better!

The executive lounge is very comfortable. Although the afternoon tea is relatively simple, the snacks are quite delicious. The variety of alcoholic beverages provided during dinner time is super comprehensive, and some people were a little shocked. The service response is very fast, and the elderly and children will be taken extra care of. My mother has been praising the ladies and sisters in the executive lounge.
The swimming pool is the best among hotels at the same price. In addition to the standard pool, there is also a children's pool and an elderly-friendly hot spring pool. Brother Vincent, who manages the swimming pool, is very nice, he introduced it in detail, and he also gave good solutions to customers who did not wear swimsuits and swimming caps.
Many people have praised the breakfast, the variety and quality are very online. Generally speaking, the western style is better than the Chinese style, especially the pastry. And it must be praised that the replenishment of dishes is very fast, and it is rare for a dish to be looted and not enough.

msg:The hotel software is very good. The breakfast is also very good. You can see the Forbidden City from the window. It is a treasure to go to Tiananmen Square, the museum, and Wangfujing. One morning, I rode a car to see the Forbidden City. It is really romantic to see the golden tower. It doesn't affect your baby's homework. It's really enjoyable now when the epidemic is over. Regent's staff will find a way to solve any problems for you. When we live in Beijing, we need the best service and comfort, and we can also catch up with the God of Wealth on the fifth day Activities, I hope this year's wealth will be abundant!

This time I met Wang Guohui, the manager on duty. He was very young and handsome, with a good attitude. He even gave the two children bear dolls, which made them very happy. 🤓🤓☺️

The elderly can rest and children can play! There is also Meimei’s afternoon tea. It is said that their afternoon tea is very famous. It is often necessary to make an appoin**ent in advance. Nice🥰 Traveling is very convenient. The downstairs is Dengshikou Station of Dengshikou Line 5. The transportation is convenient and you can walk anywhere Go to Donghua Gate of the Forbidden City, there are many local delicacies near the hotel, Sanhe Daoxiang Village, etc., Starbucks is just downstairs, next time I go to Beijing, I will choose Beijing Regent Hotel!

msg:On the day of check-in, the front desk clerk wanted me to add money to upgrade the room type! After being rejected by me, she said to use her authority to upgrade me! As a result, the room is as shown in the picture! The stool at the end of the bed is sticky and hasn't been wiped clean. I don't know what it is. It's sticky. It always feels like a mouthful of old phlegm! I called the room service to clean it up, and said it would arrive in 10 minutes, but it didn't come after waiting for a long time. Because I was more anxious about other things, I felt that they were delaying my time. The drinks provided are as shown in the picture, they are too shabby, and the beer is still collapsed! I won’t talk about the facilities, the power supply is not plugged in properly, and the phone cannot be charged; the table looks like it has been chewed by a dog! I really don't know if it was targeted because I didn't add money before! How many stars is this standard worth? Everyone judge rationally!

msg:During the Spring Festival trip to Beijing, I checked several hotels and chose the Regent Hotel based on the comprehensive evaluation and cost-effectiveness. The experience is really good. The location is 20 meters from the exit of Line 5. The staff are enthusiastic and the hotel facilities are not new. A standard swimming pool and environment are also acceptable. Mainly, I pay special attention to the mattresses of travel hotels. I don’t like beds that are too soft. This hotel has moderate mattresses and a good experience.
ps I just sat in the lobby and wrote a review when I had time.

msg:Pros: You can see the Forbidden City from the room. The location is good. The service of the hotel is very warm. When getting on and off the bus, the service staff came to open the door in time, and greeted everyone when they entered and exited. Especially the girl in the photo is enthusiastic and sweet!
The temperature of the swimming pool is very suitable, it must be above 30 degrees, and it is painless to enter the water. There is also a high-temperature pool next to the swimming pool, which is estimated to be 42 degrees, and it is best to swim up and use bubbles to drive away the cold.
Disadvantages: In the morning, my husband takes the children to eat breakfast first. He ate a bowl of noodles, and when he was almost finished, he saw a flying insect that looked like a bee and a fly. He was so disgusted! My husband said that the waiter wanted to send a fruit plate to apologize, so that the Chinese New Year's Eve will not make things difficult for them! I was going to have breakfast after putting on my makeup, but I lost my appetite after hearing what he said, so I didn't go to eat. As a result, the front desk called my husband when we checked out, saying that we had underpaid for a breakfast. It's fine if your fruit plate didn't arrive, but you want to charge an extra breakfast fee, which is too much!
In the end, I want to say that although there is this small episode, I am still satisfied overall.

msg:An established star hotel, the location is very convenient, just downstairs is the subway entrance, you don't need to transfer to Lama Temple, Peking University, Tsinghua University, Yuanmingyuan, and Summer Palace, and you can walk to Wangfujing. The front desk service and breakfast are very good. During the Spring Festival, it is also extended for half an hour. You can sleep late and have breakfast, which is great! On the evening of the New Year's Eve, I gave fruit and small cakes, thank you very much, but the taste of the small cakes is too pigmented, I hope it can be improved.
The room is a bit dated, the lighting is very dim, it is not comfortable to come back to the hotel at night.
The room service is a bit unsatisfactory. It is written in the mini bar that you can enjoy it during your stay. You have stayed for 4 days and have not made it up once. Basically, the room is only made of beds and trash every day, and the rest is left. How messy it is when it comes back, it is still messy when it comes back, the consumables that are used up are not replenished, and the cotton swabs are gone when they are used up.
It's not because I'm too lazy to move things in winter, and I want to check out the next day. Really uncomfortable, sorry for the price.
What is the welcome fruit gift? If it's three apples on the night of the New Year's Eve, then by the way, I'll eat them up on the first day, stay for 4 days, and leave the empty plate for 4 days. My check-in order is placed separately, should I make up the order every day?

msg:I stayed at this hotel on New Year's Eve, and the overall feeling is okay.
The best thing is probably the service. From the doorman outside the hotel to the reception in the lobby, to the service staff on the floor, the cordial greetings and smiling service make people warm and decent.
I seem to have a little problem with the welcome ceremony. Desserts are very satisfying for children, but apples make it difficult for me, a clean freak. The meaning of apple is very good, peace! But in the absence of tools, it is a bit embarrassing to gnaw with the skin. Can it be replaced with seasonal fruits that can be easily peeled? Or is it processed a little to make a small fruit plate? Of course, this is just my selfish idea from the perspective of a consumer. Please forgive me if I add trouble to the hotel kitchen.
The room as a whole is compact, and I appreciate the design of the bay window. A window that can be opened is designed with a concave, 🔛Window while standing by the window, the view is wide and it will not affect the neighbors, and it can also protect privacy. nice! 🛁It's very comfortable, but it's a pity that there are no simple bathing supplies. In fact, preparing some bath balls, bath salts, essential oil waxes and other supplies during the festival (accept payment form) may make the accommodation more quality and guests more Belonging. Fortunately, the bedding makes up for this shortcoming. From the pillow to the quilt to the mattress, the cleanliness is very satisfactory! It didn't make me uncomfortable at all, it was soft, comfortable and breathable. give it a like! The only unsatisfactory thing in the room is probably the big wardrobe and the carpet. Probably because of the long time? The switch sound of the large wardrobe is relatively obvious, and it cannot be completely closed. The lighting in the cabinet will always be on, which is a bit scary at night. The carpet is too old and looks dirty.
Finally, let's talk about breakfast! In addition to the low temperature of the dining environment (but the location outside the restaurant seems to be warmer, I can give a good review! There are many types, fresh ingredients, and freshly ground coffee is pleasant and tastes good! There is also a very familiar Beijing dialect! Kind!
Thanks again for the reception and companionship of the hotel on the last day of 2022 and the first day of 2023, and thank you for your hard work.

In addition, the swimming pool and fitness area are amazing, suitable for parents and children. The breakfast is rich and delicious. The old five-star hotel is trustworthy.

I would like to thank the concierge depar**ent of the hotel for being very enthusiastic and helpful in guiding the way and calling for a taxi. A young man named Eric helped us deliver our luggage to the security checkpoint of the subway when we left the hotel. Thank you very much.

msg:I have been a member of Intercontinental for many years. I got involved in Qiandao Lake Intercontinental a few years ago, and it has continued until now. I have been admiring Regent for a long time. I only stayed at Raffles Intercontinental during my New Year trip to Chongqing. I always felt a bit regretful. I finally stayed at Regent during this trip to Beijing. There was a little problem during my stay, but I met Manager Xiaoxue when I checked out, which brought warmth to an otherwise disappointing trip. I will probably stay here again next time because I saw a leader who can solve the problem. I believe it will be fine. . The quality of the specially booked executive room, afternoon tea and hh will be even better as it improves. The breakfast beef noodles are delicious.

msg:Lijing has a first-class location. It is a five-minute walk to Wangfujing Pedestrian Street, less than 100 meters from Union Hospital, and within three kilometers by car from the gates of Tiananmen, Qianmen, the Forbidden City, Jingshan, and Beijing Sea. The hotel lobby is beautifully decorated, and a whole wall of transparent glass on the rear facade integrates the back garden with the lobby. The room is large and comfortable, with a shower room and a bathtub, and each room is also equipped with a coffee machine. When I checked in, Tian Ranran at the front desk quickly checked in and told me that if I had any problems during my stay, I could find her at any time, and also sent us to the elevator, which was very warm. I continued my stay for five days in total, and I received warm and professional service from the front desk Yang Jiayu, Zhao Yuxin, and Li Caili when I went through the renewal procedures. The hotel room service staff turned up the shower pressure at my request. Probably seeing that we drank all 5 bottles of drinking water every day, the housekeeping staff automatically added 2 more bottles of drinking water for me from the third day. Also automatically added a cool clothes rack to my brother's room. Also, Lijing has a wide variety of breakfast options, including Chinese and Western styles for you to eat. In short, Regent Hotel has super five-star service, first-class hardware and first-class environment. I've stayed here since the second year of Regent's opening, and I've stayed here every time I come to Beijing since then. I found that the service of the sprinkle shop is constantly improving, which is surprising.

msg:Although there are not many pictures, I still want to recommend the hotel to everyone. I couldn't go out to Beijing during the National Day, so my child chose it if they wanted to swim. It was the first time I stayed at the Regent Hotel and I was very satisfied. The service staff from the doorman to the lobby to the restaurant to the service staff are very enthusiastic and have a good attitude. We were upgraded to a high-floor viewing room, early check-in and late check-out, and gifts such as drinks and fruits were given before we left. The room is clean and tidy, the hot water is very good, the swimming pool is great, there are three pools, a 35-degree hot spring constant temperature small swimming pool for women and children, a large swimming pool of 28 degrees, not many people, service 👌. Although the breakfast is not comparable to the varieties of hotels in the south, it is very good in Beijing. The chef personally delivered the new snacks recommended for the day for the guests to taste. The weather cooled down, and the waiter specially poured ginger tea for the guests, which was very heart-warming. The doorman greets the guests whenever they see them and helps them with their luggage. In a word, the service is satisfactory and the environment is satisfactory. I will come again when I have time next time. I wish the hotel management will continue to be better and better?

Old school's soft outfit, but very textured (the TV is really old and can be replaced). Washing a full set of Fumar (only for executives and above) is really a bit fragrant. The turndown service is quite satisfactory, but the 2*2 big bed is enough to make up for the surprise of the turndown service.
【Pool】For swimming. The swimming pool is a 25*15*1.45 infinity design, the water quality is very clean, soft and not too irritating. There are spa pools in common areas and changing rooms.
[Summary] As far as the area of Wangfujing is concerned, it maintains the level of the first echelon with the next peninsula or Waldorf Astoria. Absolutely first-class service, absolutely first-class views, absolutely first-class swimming pool.

The more powerful scenery outside the window is the building of Legendary.
The service was good and was upgraded to a higher floor. After the late check-out until 14:00, I woke up happily after taking a bath. The executive lounge is not open, so the executive trea**ent is to send welcome fruit (three apples) and a pot of tea. Kind of a pity.
The hotel is still a few years old, and I have had afternoon tea several times before. The lobby bar is very a**ospheric, but the rooms still lack some modern elements. Dark decoration is more old school. Hope it gets better and better, I still like Jinbao Street at night haha

msg:The location of Beijing Regent Hotel is very good. The Dengshikou Station of Line 5 is just downstairs, and it is only 10 minutes' walk from Wangfujing Yintai in77. It is very convenient to go everywhere.
We stayed for two consecutive days, and the front desk took the initiative to upgrade the service. The service staff in the lobby were very enthusiastic and cleaned in a timely manner.
The room is on the 15th floor and you can directly see the Forbidden City, which is unexpected.
But to mention areas for improvement:
1. At the time of booking, the Ctrip order shows that the welcome fruit for the first night is given, but I have not received it.
2. Only the toilet has a napkin box in the room, but it is not seen in other places, which is not convenient.
3. Only one bedside table has a socket, and there is no socket on the other side, which is inconvenient to charge.

Kevin Li, the duty manager, accompanied us to deal with problems throughout the process, actively helped us communicate with the community and the prevention and control center, and was meticulous and professional throughout the process, and truly implemented the service concept of treating guests as ourselves. In the end, let us remove the pop-up window smoothly and leave Beijing smoothly. Thanks Kevin Li, this hotel can handle it, I will come again next time.

msg:Let's just say I've never stayed in such a bad hotel. From furnishing to setup to service. More than 1,000 yuan is not cheap. 1: The sound insulation of the room is extremely poor! The meeting next door started at 21:00 and lasted until 23:30, and I heard all the business secrets clearly. I called the front desk to ask if I could change the room. The front desk said there was no room. I didn't transfer to the opposite side until I told the manager very seriously that we had to go to the doctor tomorrow morning and there was a patient in the room. Is it interesting that there is a room? Is it reasonable to have poor sound insulation? If you don't want to solve the problem, the first time is to shirk. 2: Call the front desk and charge 0.27 yuan. It's not about the money, it's really disgusting. It’s not that you can’t afford the two cents, the reason why you call in such a big hotel is because of your poor sound insulation! Why charge me twenty-seven cents? Does it have anything to do with money? 3: The decoration is a high-end guest house in the 1990s. The mahogany reveals the oldness. It is also an old hotel. The Legendary opposite can at least experience luxury and respect for customers. Regent just pull it down. If this hotel opens to other places, 300 per night is too much for me.

msg:The first time I went to Beijing, I chose the Regent Hotel, and I had high expectations. But I feel more disappointed in the following points.
1. The hotel swimming pool is unhygienic. On the first day I went swimming, I developed skin allergies at night and developed small red bumps on my neck.
2. The hotel service is stiff and does not know how to adapt. After staying for three nights, I came back from a trip around the world one night and was very hungry. I wanted to ask the hotel to heat up the roast duck I bought outside at noon the day before, but I was refused. Said the hotel could not help heat take-out food. I'm quite angry about this. I stayed for three nights and refused to even lend me a microwave, probably because I was afraid something would happen.
3. Breakfast was disappointing. There are many comments on Ctrip about how good the hotel breakfast is. They are really fake. In the morning, the baking area was full of croissants, the wontons and noodles were all skinned, and there was basically nothing else delicious. You had to ask the waiter for coffee, it was very weak, probably watered down like 711.
Overall disappointing, I won't come back again. It's not as good as Heping Hotel in a good location, but its price is one-third of yours!

msg:It is the best performance in all aspects of the luxury hotels I have stayed in Beijing. The view from the club king bed room is invincible. Few hotels have such a beautiful floor-to-ceiling window. The lighting in the lobby bar and the green landscape outside the window are very comfortable. You can have afternoon tea in the afternoon or chat with friends here in the evening. Although the hotel is old, the facilities are not old, the maintenance is in place, and the sense of luxury is full. The bed was comfortable, the best sleep I've ever had in so many hotels. The service is professional and enthusiastic, and the details are in place. Whether it is getting on and off the car to open the door, or storing luggage, resting in the lobby bar has just the right help. Of course, it is located in the Wangfujing business district and the advantageous location of Dongsi, so it is not boring to go anywhere. As IHG's top luxury hotel, it lives up to its reputation.

msg:I can't remember the first time I stayed at the Regent Hotel. Anyway, I chose to stay here every time I came to Beijing in the past few years. This time my son came to Beijing and asked my mother why you stayed at the Regent Hotel. I said that I like the Regent lobby. I like the beautiful flower arrangement here, I like the blooming hydrangea in the backyard (although the hydrangea this year is not as good as in previous years), I like the service here, the environment here, and the breakfast here... My son said that I also like it here, my favorite Play in the lobby. I would like to say a few more words of praise about the service. This time I checked in, Li Qingtao, Gao Jianchun and Zhao Yuxin at the front desk left a deep impression on me. Under the special epidemic environment, the reminder was in place, the check-in was fast, and the thought was very thoughtful. The details can be seen from the real effort of the hotel training, which is very in place, and the consideration for customers is also very comprehensive. Give them a thumbs up and wish them a better job!

msg:Gather with your best friend and baby
Main purpose: Relax and let the kids who can't swim enjoy swimming
The five-star era of Wangfujing has been around for a long time.
Only Regent's pools are the friendliest for non-swimmers
45cm deep, 29 degrees constant temperature, independent area
meet our main needs

The price of 1190 with double breakfast is also acceptable
Self-service a la carte breakfast surprised us during the epidemic
Exquisite, beautiful, delicious and online at the same time, especially value-for-money
Free for babies under 6 years old, half price for 6 to how much (forgive me for forgetting)

Let's talk service
Our housekeeper is Sister Jia, who is friendly, thoughtful, patient, listens very well, and can be satisfied as you wish. I am very happy, thank you Sister Jia.
We also prepared lovely chocolate and anti-humid lung appetizer tea for us.

Register as an InterContinental member and you can also get two cups of welcome benefits
Two drinks in the lobby bar (choose watermelon juice and coffee)
Room fruit (three apples, not eaten)

If you look closely, the room facilities are indeed a bit outdated. For example, the shower head of the bathtub in our room will flow from the side when using it. The waterproof platform in the bathroom is also cracked and repaired. There is also a TV... a Samsung that is very small and not very clear...

There are plenty of bottled water in the room, two cans of Coke, two Tsingtao beers and two bottles of orange juice are provided in the minibar. There are also capsule coffee and tea bags.
We all switched to orange juice.

However, after all, it is 20 years old, and it is still okay to maintain it like this. Our main purpose is swimming. This one is satisfied, and the others can be ignored.

Then the breakfast is really good👍 Feeling again

In addition, Ctrip booked one, and the other one can only be guaranteed by Ctrip for hotel payment, 2500 credit card at the store, and refunded the next day. The beauties at the front desk are also very warm and friendly, and they even gave their sons cute bears. Now the sons sleep every day.

Thank you friends for listening to me, I hope it helps you.

Compared with several five-star hotels, Regent really meets my requirements for traveling with a baby. The rooms are good, the hygiene is good, the swimming pool is very good, the water temperature is very good, and there are children's pools and hot water pools. The staff kept wiping water, packed shoes and towels, and enthusiastically prepared milk for the children. There are tea and fruit in the seating area. The employee on duty is called Yuan Wenqing, and there is a girl who is very enthusiastic. During the festival, the breakfast was changed to the order-to-table mode, which is also in line with the requirements of epidemic prevention, and the platter is really much more beautiful than taking meals yourself 😂 Reward members also have drinks in the lobby, and the foreman also thoughtfully packed biscuits for the children. I hope Regent will always maintain the level I like.

The details of the room are very attentive. The roses, bathtubs, cakes, balloons, and drinks are all very a**ospheric. I gave the baby a bear, which is very loving. The environment and dishes for afternoon tea, dinner and breakfast are very good. The afternoon tea is very rich in variety and sweet. Both salty and salty are made based on local ingredients, which are very in line with the local ecology. The afternoon tea service is very good. The dishes are introduced one by one, and the recommended order of meals is suggested. A full table is very fulfilling. Dinner is in the lobby To eat, the hanging lights outside the window are very festive~ The breakfast is very delicious, the supplements are very timely, and special bread is prepared for our special day, which is very considerate~

The luxury car on the way back to the hotel after checking out at noon was very clean and comfortable. Juice and light meals were prepared, which was very thoughtful!

Overall, this trip to Regent was very comfortable and the service was enthusiastic, which is very suitable for an important day!

The doll has been lying on the bed to watch the scenery. The swimming pool of the hotel is great. The doll is particularly happy to swim. There is also breakfast. Especially the front desk supervisor Meng Chunjiang, when he saw us with the baby, he gave the baby a bear specially and helped us solve all kinds of problems with enthusiasm and patience. Liu Baorui from the swimming pool saw the baby with him and was very enthusiastic to help. Had a happy new year at Regent!

msg:After all, the room environment is a veteran hotel, and the equipment is relatively outdated. For example, the TV is like a small hotel, but it is acceptable. However, the hotel does not state in advance that the breakfast is not changed to a la carte, or it is explained by Ctrip. It may also be changed without double breakfasts. I want to go downstairs and have breakfast, but it makes me feel overwhelmed by the a la carte. There are not many types of a la carte. There are not many Chinese and Western styles. I just checked the reviews and said that the hotel’s breakfast is relatively richer than other hotels. Otherwise, Wangfujing Street is a five-star hotel. If this is the case, I would consider staying in other hotels with newer facilities. enthusiasm.

There are a few brothers and sisters who have served very well, but I forgot the name. It seems that there is an intern named Lisa. The little sister took the trouble to help us adjust the room. There is also a bellman who also served the whole process. The front desk staff helped us to print the nucleic acid report. In short, the hotel hardware and software are very good.

2. Equipment and facilities: some are outdated, but the mahogany furniture is still more a**ospheric. I have stayed in a five-star hotel for breakfast, which is considered medium and high. It is more generous. If you order breakfast online or at the front desk, it is appropriate to go to the breakfast restaurant to get 268 copies.
3. Service: The most important point is that the service is very warm. From my check-in to the check-out, including the restaurant waiters I met, they were very polite. Before I left, I asked me how I had breakfast. I chatted with Alisa at the front desk when I checked out. A few words, I also gave a souvenir from the hotel. Although it is a charger, I still feel very careful.

msg:What kind of hotel is this... I started to hesitate as soon as we checked in and entered the room. I didn’t decide until the evening of the same day. If I get up the next day to have breakfast, I will discuss with the front desk to check out and go to another house. , Because I feel that the room facilities are a bit outdated, which is not what I like. After all, our family of four has to stay for six days and five nights, so I want to live comfortably and happily. The next day I am going to the Tiananmen Forbidden City area, so I got up early to have breakfast. It really surprised me. This is the most special and delicious breakfast in all the five-star hotels at home and abroad that I have stayed in. When I was in the hotel, many people wrote that the breakfast was rich or average, and most of them didn't have more narratives or pictures, so I took a few photos of breakfast for everyone to understand this time. In addition to Western-style dim sum and Chinese-style pasta, Regent’s breakfast also has a lot of meat and vegetable dishes. There are also a wide variety of fruits and yogurt. And the breakfast is served for a very long time....Well, let’s not check out. In the next few days, I fully felt that the service attitude written in many people's comments was good but not too attentive but just right. It was just right... Only those who have experienced it will understand it 😄... So with the excellent breakfast and good service quality, I decided that I would definitely not check out again. Later, I felt that the location here is really good. The subway station is right next to it. The kind that is only 20 steps away from the back door is more convenient than the five-star hotels we compared before, because of the traffic jam in Beijing. Great, you can only rely on the subway to get to the attractions, so the subway is really important! Thinking of so many scenic spots in Beijing, every day you can just go to the sights and you can get rid of your legs. If you get out of the subway and hold on for a minute or two to get to your bed, it is so beautiful and timely happiness...the penultimate We were really tired, so we stayed in the hotel to rest. I thought that someone in the review said that the swimming pool has a heated pool. Is it possible to take a dip in the hot spring? We went to the swimming pool on the fifth floor to take a look. There is a large swimming pool, a children’s pool, and a pool with a temperature of 40 degrees. There are saunas in the men’s and women’s locker rooms for steaming and separate hot and cold water pools. I decided to swim in the hot water in the afternoon. In addition, the gym and a mirrored aerobics room (dance room) are also on the fifth floor. When you go to the swimming pool, you will pass through these two separate large rooms first. It feels that the equipment is also quite good. There are also chairs at the front desk on the fifth floor for people to rest. There are several vitamin C drinks and fruits for guests to eat. It feels very thoughtful and considerate. Mr. Yuan Wenqing, who is in charge of the fifth floor, has great service and delivered them promptly after we swim. With fruit and water... Suddenly, I gave this hotel a big bonus, and I must add more points! And the hotel bed is very comfortable, the mattress is not very soft, the more tired you sleep, it can be compared with the tens of thousands of mattresses in our house. Although the room facilities are a bit outdated, the hygiene is good. My skin is very sensitive. So I was terrified at first when I saw a carpet prone to accumulate mites in the room, but after a few days of sleep, I didn’t have itchy skin. Ah, I would like to thank the eldest sister (sixth floor) who has been helping us to clean the room these days. She is very serious and responsible for her work! In addition, the hotel has welcome fruits on the first day, and the drinks in the small refrigerator are free on the first day. There are anti-epidemic supplies, masks and disinfection wipes every day. The breakfast restaurant will also prepare masks for guests to use. I specifically asked the hotel for a simple folding drying rack... In short, the above series of personal experience and feelings made me a little reluctant to leave this hotel after staying for five nights. The a little outdated facilities are nothing at all. ❤️ I should stay here again when I come to Beijing. I will also tell my friends about the wonderful feelings that Regent gave me this time, and recommend them to stay at Regent to feel it. Super five-star praise, I hope that the employees of Regent and Regent are getting better and better 👍

The room is indeed a bit old and the toilet is not silent. The service is okay. I saw that those who checked in at the same time and brought children gave bears. When I contacted by phone in advance, I mentioned that I brought the children. I did not receive any gifts for the children until I checked out. The house price is not cheap, the average price of staying for five days is nearly 1,300, I don’t understand where the problem is 🤷‍♀️

msg:I was mentally prepared for the services of Beijing hotels before, and the differences between the north and the south have caused everyone to have different standards of service. I personally feel that the service of the Regent Hotel is better than that of the Grand Hyatt Hotel. At least there is no such thing as an answer from the Grand Hyatt Hotel. The two-day stay is generally more enthusiastic. The decoration of the hotel may be longer. Although the maintenance is good, the overall It's still more drama, the size of the TV, the degree of wear of the socket, and so on, personally feel that the points are relatively degraded. The most important thing to complain about is breakfast. There are a bunch of inexplicable things on the table, occupying about 60% of the table space. The key is that your dishes are not so many that you need all kinds of condiments, and there will be breakfast plates. The embarrassment that there is no place to put it. There is also parking. Maybe the core area of the Great Emperor’s capital has a lot of money. The parking fee needs to be paid by yourself, but the price is not too expensive. I think that if the hotel is done, the guest experience may be better. I won’t say much about the good places. The location, transportation, and sanitation are all pretty good, but I hope the hotel can learn from each other's strengths so as to keep more repeat customers.

One is that it is easy to break and cannot be locked, and the other is that someone maliciously locked it without knowing it. Managers don't know if there are any empty cabinets, it's easy to conflict! If there are members and hotel guests receiving at the same time, there will suddenly be a lot of people. If you can't receive them at the same time, don't receive so many people. This was the first time I stayed in a hotel, and it made me so angry. I wanted to stay there, but the old lady maliciously told me not to come as soon as possible, which would hinder their membership. The hotel just wants peace of mind. Very bad experience!

msg:A very, very, very bad experience...
1. Toilet facilities. The bathtub is very wide and made of slippery material, without any hand-held facilities and prompt signs. So that I almost didn't stupid in the bathroom, and the inside of my knee was black and purple. (Picture 1⃣️) Because there was a child who couldn't go out to buy medicine and asked for help from room service, the room manager gave me a brand new personal oin**ent. No one asked me about my injury in the follow-up. Although he didn't want it when checking out, I think it was his personal belongings or the cost of the oin**ent.
2. Room facilities. The distance between the bed and the wall is very narrow, but a bed frame with sharp corners is placed, so that it hurts and screams constantly when I hit me for the first time. Head-on bone swelling is still a bulge to this day.
3. The laundry depar**ent. Send 5 pieces of clothes to wash. The lady who came to pick up the clothes stiffly emphasized twice before washing the clothes, I will contact you. Then I really called me. Your trouser pockets are torn, and the decoration of your clothes is incomplete...so that I thought I was wearing a tattered shirt. I took it back and I checked it carefully, especially I want to call and ask the lady, do you need to know about the uneven symmetry of frayed jeans and accessories? You have not passed through the laundry depar**ent, shouldn't you have more professional knowledge!
4. Swimming pool. First of all, I would like to say that the two coaches Wei Yuepeng and Yuan Wenqing are really good, and they are also very serious and responsible for the children's private lessons. Thank you again. However, the child's eyes started to swell after two consecutive days of swimming. Can I doubt that the water quality is not up to the standard!
But seeking truth from facts, except for the lady who came to pick up the clothes in a weird manner, the other operators and room attendants were still very friendly. It can be regarded as a little bit of sunshine in the haze. In short, this time the admission was really terrible... I stayed for two nights and my child came back with bruises and red eyes. I was always very angry, but I didn’t want to talk about it like this, but the child shouted that his eyes hurt before going to bed. I really couldn’t help it. Write it down and hope that it will attract the attention of your hotel. At least no one can talk to me. Suffer the same injury!

msg:I have stayed in so many hotels, this is the only hotel I want to evaluate, front beam: bad hotel. Process: Arrived at the hotel at 12 noon on the 10th, told me that the room was not cleaned up, let me wait for forty minutes, and I had a meal again during the period. A bowl of ordinary noodles that can’t be ordinary, cost me 173 yuan, may I ask for the charge What is the standard, please see the first paid screenshot. Forty minutes later, the front desk asked for a room card and told me that it might not have been cleaned up. The front desk contacted the floor manager. The front desk said to change the room, and then directly issued the card to me. Later, I understood that this was because the room was not given before, and I would give it after an hour's delay. The efficiency is too low! When I entered the room, I wanted to take a break. I flipped the quilt, and a piece of hair was put on the quilt. It was very unpleasant when I opened the room, so I didn't call the front desk again, so I asked for trouble! I want to ask how this hair is here, whether the sheets were not changed at all, or the auntie who changed the sheets fell off. Please see the second picture. I was awakened by mosquitoes at three o’clock in the evening and bit no less than ten packages. I couldn’t find the electric mosquito coils in the room. Call the front desk service and ask for the electric mosquito coils. Ten minutes have passed and the hotel hasn’t delivered them. The room phone call the front desk for the first time, and then check and monitor what time it was delivered to see if I lied. Please see the third picture. Evaluation: The charges are expensive, the facilities are outdated, the sanitation is poor, and the service is worse. It is not at the same level as Shangri-La Hilton, and not as good as Hanting Home Inn.

msg:As a cleanliness + anxious mother, she took two children for 12 days alone, compared hotel after hotel, and finally chose Regent under the recommendation of a girlfriend. Fortunately, Regent brought me a perfect and comfortable experience. User experience.
From the day before I traveled, I experienced the high-quality service of Regent. I took the initiative to make a bed for me and collected the express delivery from **all supermarket. When I arrived in the middle of the night, everything was ready.
Room hygiene and service: Every day the room attendant takes the initiative to clean the room, and tidy up like I just checked in. Every time I take the initiative to change the sheets, the drinking water is not limited, and the waiter reminds me to drink water. Just say it if it's not enough. The children often called the front desk, the toys fell in the cracks, the TV remote was missing, and every little thing was taken seriously.
From the first day of waking up, the children love the lobby lounge. The desserts and drinks there are delicious. The waiters are handsome and beautiful, but also very nice and considerate. Our room does not include breakfast. The front desk reminds you We bought the voucher a day in advance, but the children have to go to the lobby lounge for breakfast every day.
The children bought fruit and brought them up. It was too heavy. The little brother waiter always saw the initiative to help. The concierge service at the door was very attentive. When getting on and off the bus, he came to open the door in time and took the luggage and put the luggage in good order.
The Regent Hotel left a good impression on the children. This is a historic and low-key luxury hotel. I am impressed by the cleanliness and attention to details. I will stay again and recommend others to stay.

msg:Love the Regent Hotel very much
Transportation: Walk straight on the right hand side of the hotel's gate for 2 or 3 minutes to get to Dengshikou Metro Station of Line 5. Go straight out of the gate to reach Wangfujing. There are many bus lines nearby, not far from Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City. There are many shared bicycles nearby, and it is quick and convenient to travel by bicycle during the 7.1 traffic control period. It only takes 15 minutes to ride to Jingshan Park to see the full view of the Forbidden City. Ps, standing in front of the window, you can see the Forbidden City from a distance
Room: The large glass curtain wall is amazing, and the bedding is too comfortable. Tired of playing in Beijing’s attractions, the child can sleep in seconds when he gets to the bed. The decoration style of the room is indeed a bit old, but the lobby and the restaurant on the first floor are really beautiful, which adds a lot of points.
food
The room includes breakfast, not the most things, but there are still a lot of choices for the combination of Chinese and Western. Many waiters are a bit older, but they are all attentive and enthusiastic. One day I got up late and there were still 20 minutes to take the meal. The waitress came to us and said, "It's almost time to take the meal. Go get some more food and eat more." The authentic Beijing accent makes people happy and heartwarming. The waiter in the lobby is also very active and the service is very heartwarming. It is indeed a high-end brand under InterContinental.
After traveling in Beijing, I must still live here!

msg:It feels very good to stay in. In fact, the hotel is not too new. The facilities are not as luxurious as the newly opened hotels, but the service is enough to make up for it. What does a 5-star hotel offer is service? ……First of all, the room is very clean. I display my cosmetics one by one, in order of height. I travel countless times a year on business trips. This is the first one I have seen in China. There are a lot of people for breakfast, but they all have their seats in order. What impressed me was that I wanted a single-sided fried egg. I forgot to eat and eat. I just remembered it when I finished eating. I can’t say that my eggs are fried. No, just said that I wanted to fry the eggs, but the chef said it was done and brought them out from the back. 3. On the day before leaving for breakfast, a waiter took a bag and told me that I heard that you are going to check out and leave today. We have prepared some fruits and drinks for you. I hope you have a pleasant journey. In fact, things are very simple. It is a bottle of mineral water, a bottle of juice and an apple, but it reflects service and warmth. Fourth, since the flight is at 8 o’clock, I know that the suite can be checked out until 4 o’clock, but it seems too early to go to the airport at 4 o’clock. I tried to ask if I can extend it to 5 o’clock, because it’s almost half a day at 6 o’clock. Just ask if you feel like it. I didn't expect the service depar**ent of the hotel administration building to consider your special circumstances and help you extend it until 5 o'clock, because there are so many people traveling in summer, so please understand. Alas, there are really not many 5-star hotels in China that have this kind of service. I experienced this kind of service at the Cultural Oriental Hotel in Tokyo, Japan. The key is their debating time with guests. At that time, I was with my son. We asked for special things such as tea and coffee. They would ask if you still want unsweetened coffee and egg rolls the next day.
In addition, in order for you to go to the next level, I would like to make a few suggestions. The tea kettle I have brewed has not been poured out. The tea cups are still placed on the table after cleaning. It is recommended that other than the customer’s things, other things that should be cleaned should be returned to the original place. it is good. Thanks again for the excellent service of Regent Hotel. In addition, when I checked in at the front desk, the front desk said that you are our member. I was wondering when I lived in Regent. Later, when I came back from the outside, I glanced at the house number and realized... Regis, right? , I have stayed at St. Regis many times in Sanya and Osaka, Japan, haha, it’s really interesting... I hope I have a chance to stay again

The location in Beijing Regent is superior. In comparison, it is also outstanding among nearby hotels, with cordial service, no dead spots in hygiene, and professional gym equipment Although it is not rich and well maintained, the swimming pool is huge and the water quality is excellent. What surprised me was that the men’s depar**ent even had a sauna and an ice pool. The environment was warm and the view of the special executive lounge was very good. No matter what, it’s worth staying again.

msg:I didn’t go out of Beijing and booked a one-day tour of the Forbidden City. This time I chose the Regent Hotel. The room voucher includes a three-course dinner for two. The Thai-style fried chicken is good, but Tsingtao Beer doesn’t like it, so I changed it to Beijing A for free. , But the most amazing thing is the red velvet cake. I accidentally found that the cake room is half price after 5:30, so I can enjoy it. The next day I ordered two sets of afternoon teas, Ruchu Ruchu and Prosperity World. Maybe it was because I was hungry after a day of playing. The visual experience was two minutes and I started eating. The hamburgers are very good, the scones are average, and the lipstick chocolate is good to eat. A bit tired. The room is not big but the overall facilities are good. After a long day of playing, the bathtub bubble is provided, bath salt and loofah are provided, and it is convenient to take five bottles of water every day to go out and play. There are yoga classes in the hotel gym from Monday to Friday. We did not catch up at this time, but the swimming pool is good, children like it, and the elderly also have a hot pool, soaking in and watching the baby. The hotel is not far from the Forbidden City. It is also an experience to ride a bike at night to visit Beijing. When checking out, the hotel service consultation and the subsequent telephone call were very heartwarming. During the period, I felt the anti-mosquito liquid and breakfast fruit. I listened carefully to the feedback. Next time I can take the parking fee into consideration. It is perfect. I stopped for three days. Hundreds of hundreds...Generally speaking, I feel good, I can choose here next time

First of all, the traffic is very convenient, just next to Wangfujing and just avoid the hustle and bustle of the crowd. The subway station is right at the door, and it's easy to take a taxi. The breakfast is also good. The best thing is the service, with perfect details. The only shortcoming, I think the equipment is slightly old. Overall it's pretty good.

The hotel location is convenient for a taxi, and it takes five minutes to walk to Wangfujing Street. It is very convenient. The room was very clean, I took the child and added a hundred yuan to the room on the 16th floor to see the garden. The only thing that was true was that the sound insulation was a little bit worse, the big brother in the next room snored, and the whole night was uninterrupted and the hearing was clear.

msg:Regent Hotel hardware and software are very poor. 1. Hardware: The breakfast is not good, like the breakfast in a high-end business hotel, the venue is small, the variety is small, and there is no yogurt. The lobby pool in the public area is not bad, which is worth affirming. However, the hygiene in the room is not to be praised. After all, it is a place to sleep. There is a sour and musty smell when entering the room, and I want a non-smoking room. The shower has the hair of the previous guest. . . A little nauseated. Too many people during summer vacation? I didn't change rooms after staying for one night, I think it might be the same. 2. In terms of software: I personally think that the hygiene issue just mentioned is a management issue. There is an angry thing is, one o'clock in the middle of the night! At one o'clock in the middle of the night, the sleeping guests were woken up. First call my mobile phone, then call the room, let me go to register and make up the deposit! ! I guaranteed the payment in full, but harassed me at midnight and asked me to make up the deposit in the middle of the night? Later, the hotel explained to me that they called me to make sure I was there. Call me in the middle of the night to make sure I have arrived at the store? ? My mother is not as "worry about me" as you are. Ridiculously loose management without knowing it! It is hard to imagine how to ensure hygiene and food safety under such management? ! Think about it and feel scared.

msg:做為親子行非常棒的酒店
首先，前台非常熱情有禮
其次，我要誇爆7樓客房保潔的李阿姨，是我見過的最敬業的客服服務人員，見我們有兩個小孩，主動提出幫我們把雙床合併，還主動幫我們多送被子。第二天見到我們前一天游泳用過了浴袍，又主動幫忙換了乾淨的。方方面面想得非常非常周到，而且始終笑容可鞠。
然後泳池也很棒，水温非常友好，工作人員都很熱情。
下次來北京還會選麗晶，絕對性價比之王

msg:北京麗晶酒店：卡爾.拉格斐下午茶之旅

對待攜程、貓途鷹等平台的入住評論或是酒店集團通過郵箱發送的會員隨機入住調查問卷，各家酒店的對待態度是大相徑庭的，這和中方業主的經營理念、強勢與否、發展重點、層級如何等諸多方面都有千絲萬縷的聯繫，總之，酒店和酒店之間，完全不可同日而語。粗略上分一下，大抵有以下幾種。第一，完全不顧，大撒把型的，客人愛怎麼評價怎麼評價，反正就是不愁客人，這類酒店往往業主方背景深厚或是地理位置奇佳；第二，潤物細無聲，對於自己的服務和硬件等各方面都非常自信，他們深知，即便客人再雞蛋裡挑骨頭，也不會找出任何大缺憾，相信客人一定會客觀評價，所以，從不會騷擾客人，讓客人給好評，這類酒店往往是那種任何一個層面都無可指摘的標桿類、榜樣類明星酒店；第三，就是自己心虛，用各種方式索要好評的酒店。這裏麪，急功近利的嘴臉又各不相同，有一種是委婉的在退房時跟你説：“程先生，您住的還滿意嗎？要是方便的話，請您在收到問卷後給個五星好評，十分感謝您！如果能帶上我的名字，我就更加感激不盡了！我叫……”有一種則是直截了當：“程先生，我加您微信，給您撰寫了一段評論，您複製黏貼發表一下即可，打攪您了。”還有一種更甚，就是北京麗晶酒店前台的Yuki，退房時，她會更直白地説：“程先生，您把手機給我吧，我給您寫評論！”要不是我説著急辦事兒，她半起半落的手臂馬上就要就勢兒過來“搶奪”我的手機了，實在太low了——這些言談舉止和行為表現方式是很傷害麗晶品牌形象的。酒店停車是不免費的，户外停車場正常價格收費，這裡是四九城核心區，停車費自然是超貴的。要做好心理準備，呵呵。      

事實上，北京麗晶已經住膩了，即便是沒被洲際集團收編前，也住過N多次了，所以，現在也是主動去住，其實是提不起興趣的。這次之所以住，是酒店大堂吧推出了“卡爾.拉格斐”聯名下午茶，所以帶老婆和倆兒子特意再去打卡住一遍，畢竟，老佛爺在時尚界的金字塔地位，就有點兒類似於切.格瓦拉在搖滾樂迷（儘管風馬牛不相及，但卻是是實打實的精神圖騰與信仰源泉）心中的地位一樣，時尚圈的凱撒大帝，不是鬧著玩兒的，更不是浪得虛名，因此，即便仙逝已久，他的相關新聞或故事，份量依舊舉足輕重。此聯名下午茶會一直持續到年底，甜點極其豐富，特別適合小盆友。大堂吧還特意準備了一張專屬黑桌子，桌面是卡爾.拉格斐經典頭像版畫，榮譽感和自豪感十足。下午茶分為888和1888兩種，區別在於有沒有巴黎之花香檳，後者其實更適合戀人小酌怡情。酒店從上到下，幾乎無一人瞭解洲際酒店“優拍”這件事兒，無論是中層管理（譬如大堂吧劉經理等）還是基層員工，都是一臉懵，既不知道怎麼核銷（這家酒店99%的員工都是第一次知道“優拍”這件事兒，天啊），也不知道怎麼操作（比如巴黎之花是給一瓶還是給一杯等等），更不知道怎麼應對，總之，是一種一問三不知的狀態。看起來，還是要加強和集團層面的溝通協調，更重要的還是員工培訓，集團方方面面的冷知識都該信手拈來才對。      

酒店地理位置好到極點，寸土寸鑽石，地鐵燈市口站為酒店單獨開了個口兒，您瞧這面子多大。酒店斜對面過一個路口就是我倆兒子的學校——北京景山學校，放了學走過來即可。以前，倆兒子還小時，也是在酒店俱樂部（行政酒廊）吃完早餐，直接下樓步行去澳門中心上英文課，一切都近在咫尺（話説，他們家頂層俱樂部挑高是真的高，要超過北京華彬費爾蒙的酒廊挑高，將金寶街的繁華盡收眼底）。因此，衹要北京有啥風吹草動、大事小情（賽事、活動、會議……），酒店就會迅即滿房，甚至被徵用，所以，一丁點兒都不愁客流和盈利，在北京麗晶邂逅明星藝人要客等等，那是常有的事兒。這次破天荒第一次沒給我升級套房，也沒給行政待遇，倆兒子很訝異，幾乎是啥也沒有（入住期間正好趕上珠寶展，也確實很難擠出房間），歡迎水果和歡迎甜品的水準衹能説一直在線吧，並沒有進階。除了位置好外，酒店其它方面乏善可陳，比如，硬件老舊。但是話又説回來，那麼大體量的酒店，重新裝修的話，會是一筆天文數字的支出，類似於香港洲際的重新調整。其實，這都不重要，因為北京麗晶的中方業主太有實力，錢不是問題，關鍵是如此長的空窗期，會失掉很多市場和機會，這是業主方不願看到的，因此，裝不裝修，這是件極其糾結的事兒。      

早餐是必須點讚的，早餐廳的員工和中層領導，一個比一個專業，待人接物也讓人覺得如沐春風，特別自然、體貼，建議酒店的其它部門都多學學。餐廳有專門的鑽石大使專區，早上就有各種洋酒供應，這一點還是很細心周到、特立獨行的。麗晶是一個命運多舛（一開始在麗笙旗下，當時，所有“麗”字輩兒的酒店都是他們家的，比如麗筠等等，因此，當時的北京麗晶和麗亭其實是同一集團麾下的雙子星酒店，後來，麗晶成了台灣商人的囊中物，也就是台北晶華集團，再後來，洲際受夠了麗晶51%股份，而弔詭的是，錦江又收購了麗笙集團，因此，北京麗晶對面的親弟弟麗亭，現在已經是妥妥的中國上海品牌啦，雙子星二者已無關係）的小眾普奢品牌，在洲際集團內部的地位，目前僅次於六善（跟高奢品牌一大堆的萬豪比起來，洲際在高端領域還需要再多加把勁兒，還好，洲至奢選在杭州已經啟幕，未來，還會在羊城佈局，也就是廣州香嵐，期待ing）。目前，全球一共有9家麗晶（峇里島麗晶尚未啟幕）：康城麗晶是最不像麗晶、最沒有麗晶元素的Regent，甚至嚴格意義上説，不能算是一家真正的麗晶，更適合被歸納到洲至奢選品類中；最小眾的是黑山麗晶；富國島麗晶的景色已經超過了自家的富國島洲際，可惜豪華程度和翡翠灣JW還是略遜一籌；重裝回歸後的香港麗晶顯然是麗晶這個品牌現在的實力天花板，是最拿得出手的；一直在線的麗晶有柏林、上海、重慶；較普通的是設計感極強的台北和今天所述的北京。

設施：老舊。吹風機風速很低且有燒焦味。電視機的畫質讓我回到九十年代。雙床房間裏一張書桌一個椅子——請問兩個人要如何在房間裏用餐？在沙發上嗎？

衞生：挺好的。

環境：挺好的。

早餐很難吃，無論是2樓大廳還是17樓的行政酒廊。是哪個天才想出來的往烤蘑菇裏放致死量的迷迭香？除了藍莓酸奶以外就沒有能吃的東西。和重慶的麗晶差遠了。

沒有洗衣服務。外賣默認自己去門外的外賣架拿，禮賓部不會主動送上來。這些都是重慶麗晶吸引了我但北京麗晶沒有滿足的地方。

        全國各地的酒店住了不少，麗晶雖然房間不是最奢華的，但是是住過酒店裡麪服務最好的，感謝yedda 、angel、Frank、Lucas，服務態度非常好！不但安排了小童小拖鞋，牙刷，洗髮液這些東西，還送了果盤，甜品。讓北京之行留下了難忘的經歷。
        酒店從前台到值班經理，從樓層服務員到泳池服務人員，從行李員到門口的保安，從餐廳迎賓到餐廳服務員，每個人都禮貌問好，笑臉相迎，可謂是賓至如歸。
        小孩不小心夾到手，致電服務中心，很快送來了碘伏棉簽和創可貼，值班經理夜間還致電問候，第二天酒店管理人員還致電問候並送上了甜品。非常驚喜，一個小小的舉動感到了家人，下次來北京肯定還住北京麗晶！
        酒店位置非常好，和北京王府半島，華爾道夫在同一個位置，離apm非常近，王府井近在咫尺，樓下就是地鐵5號線燈市口站，從酒店側門出去就是地鐵進站口，40度的北京就需要這樣的酒店！

入住之前擔心酒店年代久遠，硬件設施老化，入住之後，發現完全不用擔心，酒店設施完善，維護良好，完全看不出年紀，更加難能可貴的是酒店的服務，完美的詮釋了洲際酒店集團的企業文化理念，員工行為規範，服務優質。這裏要特別感謝的是酒店為我們準備的加濕器，以及空調師傅的細緻調試，讓我們在端午節四十多度的高温之下，也可以安然入睡。
如果一定要説出一個需要提升的地方，那就是酒店的早餐雖然不差，但並沒有十分出彩。期待酒店越來越好！

？？？就很離譜，一個五星級酒店，你們不檢查房間衞生麼，這件事情後面的阿姨重新換了一個燒水壺，態度也很好我也就沒想法，但是晚上我11點到酒店，酒店刷房卡上電梯，衹有一邊能刷，是一個美女刷了我就按了我住的樓層，然後房卡刷不了，我是衹住一晚但是11點也沒到第二天房卡就不能用了？？？打樓層的公共電話直接打不通，下到一樓重新刷，酒店説“是不是中間房卡重新刷過”無語，我1點多開的房間，進來休息了半小時就出門一直到11點，主要我去了天津回不來，不然我都以為我什麼回酒店刷了。
説真的很累了回酒店打算好好休息，但是房間進不去那會真的有點崩潰，電話打不通那會我是真的炸了，我覺得這次體驗太差了，我覺得一個五星級酒店能出這樣的問題，太離譜了，把誰當**呢？
中午就出門了回到酒店這床我們離開時是什麼樣回來還是什麼樣，我以為開夜床服務是標配，原來是我膚淺了。
還有攜程騙我呢，説好的歡迎水果難道説是我自己帶的藍莓？
不過第二天退房，我們16點的飛機幫我們延遲到14點，就是怎麼説昨天的火氣消了一半…

很重視顧客的需求和意見，在同等五星酒店裡，算是性價比很高的，設施衞生都還不錯。就是室內空調温度過高，與室外温差有點大。需要注意不要感冒。本次我就中招了，泳池水温很好，一點都不冷。相對比君悦的泳池水，就感覺出來差距了，早餐中規中矩，沒有特別的亮點，外賣都是放在酒店門口的枱子上，建議做外賣櫃，或者小機器人送一下。或者放在酒店裡麪，因為温度太低了，出去拿個外賣就容易凍感冒。感覺酒店的管理很不錯。對待顧客的意見至少很重視，以後還會入住，推薦。

msg:因為回國的飛機有到北京的直航打算在北京玩兩天，因為靠近景區選了麗晶。最後因為太累了實際也沒去玩，泡了兩天酒店，非常滿意。
服務很熱情，ci的時候就全程幫拿行李去房間，在酒店活動的時候碰到每個服務人員都會熱情打招呼。
早餐很豐盛，各類麪包甜點、中餐西餐都有，三文魚也不限量，現做蛋餅也很好吃。
最喜歡的是酒店的恆温泳池，去了三次。在這個天去游泳也不會冷，泳池很漂亮，水也很乾凈沒有什麼消毒水的味道，水深是1.2-1.5，對游泳新手很友好。有太陽的時候陽光透過側面玻璃照進來，配合著周邊的綠植和播放的鳥鳴的聲音，感覺置身在熱帶。
地理位置是很好的，就在地鐵口（燈市口站），離故宮等景區也非常近，如果是想旅遊住在這裏也非常方便，總之十分推薦。

1、在電梯區的電話是無法使用的，上面寫了“有需要幫助可使用”，但是電話可能出問題了，沒法使用。
2、辦理入住的時候説是什麼會員有一盒月餅可直接送到房間，但是實際沒有。這個我是覺得如果承諾了就要做到。

酒店工作人員服務態度好，彬彬有禮，且十分熱情，知道我們要晾衣服，立馬主動提供了大衣架，讓人感覺十分貼心。
酒店的地理位置非常優越，步行10分鐘就能到王府井，酒店旁邊就是5號線，換成1號線和2號線十分方便，便於去景點。北京城區打車不方便，並且容易堵車，還是地鐵方便且快。以後再來北京仍舊會選擇這家酒店。

Price: It is recommended that you do not choose a high-rise. The so-called high-rise with extra money is the 10th-11th floor, not the 11th and above floors. You will be asked to add money at the front desk.

酒店恆温泳池也不錯，我兒子怕冷都能玩很久；除了大池子，還有兩個適合小朋友的小池子，温度比較高，像温泉～還有桑拿室，不過我忘記帶泳衣了，沒有體驗到～

酒店位置非常好，離燈市口地鐵站很近，從咖啡吧那頭走出去不到一分鐘吧，對面還有個便利店；這一點真的非常重要！北京太難打車了，而且打車經常遭遇交通管制，耗時長，所以交通首選還是地鐵。

最最讓我印象深刻的還是酒店服務，真的有賓至如歸的感覺，服務人員都是笑臉相迎，非常熱情～中途臨時有面試，也能借到電腦（後來去索菲特了就木有借到：（

總之下次來北京還是會選擇麗晶，太適合帶娃出行，很滿意！

本來訂的俱樂部大床套房，但是前台開成了雙床，電話溝通後5分鐘也解決了此問題，3000多的房價也很值。
唯一不滿意的是第二天午飯回來取行李準備離店時，在酒店大堂稍坐了一會，負責沙龍區域的短髮微胖平劉海女服務員態度不好，愛搭不理且示意我們不可以坐到消費區，真的很無語。當時也想着喝杯咖啡再走，也沒有了心情。
而且在我起身整理東西，還沒有離開時，就把我的座位用膝蓋踢回原位，真的非常不禮貌。希望加強此方面培訓，其他工作人員真的非常熱情耐心。

最值得稱讚的是大堂服務，非常主動親切，及時幫忙拿行李、給予幫助、甚至幫忙照看孩子。下次來還會選擇這家酒店！

msg:就本次的入住體驗，對一家五星級酒店我衹能給四星，原因兩方面：
一是硬件方面，房間隔音一般，本來有人從房門外過道走聲音比較大還算能接受，但是晚上甚至半夜在房間裏能聽到周邊房間（隔壁或是樓上）的説話聲有點受不了，因為是大半夜時間也太久了，自己本身懷孕睡眠就一般，所以這點實在給不了五分。
二是軟件服務方面，整體來説服務還是可以的，比如幫忙拿行李開電梯，再比如主動問好，再比如有歡迎水果蛋糕以及紅酒。但是我認為服務還不夠細緻。晚上洗澡的時候把浴室推拉門鎖上了，洗完澡之後開鎖了拉不開，實在沒辦法電話給前台安排師傅來解決，等師傅等了一會兒，門外的小朋友着急進來用馬桶，我比較着急又催了一遍説很急師傅才到，最後是工具撬開的。因為比較晚了怕耽誤小朋友睡覺，再加上第二天也就退房了就沒讓師傅維修，但事後的當晚和第二天早上前台都沒有電話或者當面詢問解決情況，這一點讓顧客體驗很不好，是不夠重視這個問題嗎？事後當晚心情很不好，萬一是小朋友鎖在裏面了怎麼辦呢！如果不是很晚另外一大早要退房我一定會找客服經理理論至少要求換房間的！最後在退房的時候我主動跟前台説了這個情況，也是擔心後面再入住該房間的萬一小朋友遇到了同樣情況，好在前台知道後道歉態度較好，希望事後及時維修吧。

msg:一家開業15年，依然值得五星的酒店
燈市口-地鐵站C出口步行10米可以進入酒店大堂。出行不用考慮天氣/堵車。
客房確實是歲月痕跡明顯，設施舊（比起旁邊的半島）。但對於我客房衹是酒店體驗的一小部分。不喜歡深色內飾風格的話，最好不要選擇這家酒店。
奔着故宮景觀的酒廊，預訂的行政房型，必須説是超美&超值了。酒廊服務團隊素質與態度極佳
大堂的花園景簡直美翻了，大堂吧坐着非常舒服
泳池堪稱王府井區域No.1，度假氛圍超棒，服務員袁文慶也很盡責
早餐沒有拍，從服務員到廚師（尤其是廚師）服務態度都很熱情親切。這對於一日之晨很重要。
我以實際行動支持這間酒店，不是第一次入住它了。而且它性價比真的非常高。

總體服務很好禮賓特別熱情有禮貌，餐廳也提前一天打電話確認具體預訂日期，第一天一進房間就發現備了很多瓶水，早餐品質都不錯，各種備品補得也很及時，馥馬爾的洗護用品挑得很好不過是大瓶，酒店床頭櫃上的閲讀燈的開關是一個小撥片特別細節有質感，就是枱燈底部的皮質包裹有點舊了磨損了，酒店視野和房間衞浴佈局都合理不會感覺浪費了空間也不會使人感覺擁擠，插頭位置在書桌牀頭櫃開門處都有，電子同時設備充電得到了保證，酒店位置離王府井很近而且附近景點也多，退房這個階段也很流暢，如果來旅遊非常推薦這裏。

辦理入住的時候工作人員特別熱情，退房給延遲到兩點十分人性化，留下了很好的第一印象。送了歡迎水果，小童用品也很齊全，小拖鞋，小童牙膏牙刷沐浴露，還有小童馬桶座，很方便。房間裏的飲用水給的很足，早餐豐盛，贈送的午餐水準很高。
處處的服務人員服務都很到位。
雖然設施相較新酒店略顯過時，但瑕不掩瑜，這個地段五星酒店裡的性價比之選。
唯一有一點點不方便就是電梯的梯控對第一次入住的客人不太友好，包括我們在內的好幾個客人都折騰了好久。再就是浴室的插座蓋子有點覆蓋住了插座眼，導致上面兩孔的插座有點插不進去，老是掉，用吹風和自帶電器的時候不方便。大廳看不到垃圾桶，有時候手邊的垃圾完全不知道往哪兒扔。😂
總體來説十分滿意。

泳池很不錯，適合帶孩子來，大人能遊，孩子能玩兒。整個健身中心的服務團隊很熱心但很安靜，印象中Vincent Liu給我們很多具體的幫助。

再説設施，這裏的泳池是我這幾家常去的五星級酒店中最好的，當然可能也趕上人少，但是游泳真的很舒服。孩子也是期待下次繼續來。
地理位置也很不錯，離步行街很近很近，周邊好吃的非常多。而酒店早餐雖然種類一般，但是質量不錯，尤其是牛肉麪不錯，更甭説服務一流。
總體來説，非常滿意。下次有機會還是會來。體驗非常開心。

説説遺憾吧，第一次住給升級了行政，入住體驗滿分還可以再附加分。從泡泡浴球到迎賓糕點，還有禮物小熊，都是非常貼心。但這次説了很久都沒給升級，雖然説是正常程序，但是心裏落差還是有的，小朋友的體驗差了很多。

衞生：房間衞生情況還不錯。
環境：還不錯。
服務：大堂服務比較好，客房服務參差不齊，有服務員送東西來很有禮貌，也有人送東西來扔給你一言不發就跑的。入住期間去文華東方吃了頓飯，那個服務和麗晶相比，真的是天與地的差距。
早餐:早餐比較差，天天都差不多都是固定的那些樣，品種也少，感覺沒啥可吃的，住了五天，後來直接去外面吃早餐了。加早需要差不多200元一位，我覺得值個80塊差不多了。
另外覺得酒店有些方面摳搜搜的，明明住的2位客人，衹給放一雙拖鞋，陸連續幾天都是，紙巾、飲用水也不補，搞不懂，搞不懂。
總體來説，酒店最滿意的地方就是位置了，地鐵口，走哪都方便，不過今後去北京應該會換地方住了，這個價位可選擇的太多了。

説方便服務好
住下第一晚11點多樓上小朋友來回跑步吵的我睡不着心煩意亂，打電話給前台，她們説去看一下，過一會給我回電話説去説過了，果然後來安靜了

退房結賬的時候送了小朋友禮物和紀念品還免了小朋友2天的早餐，有點意外
有點驚喜

msg:總體滿意！
每次入住麗晶總是給5分，這次給4分。希望在以下方面改進：
1. 入住時行李是我們自己拖到房間的，以前都是禮賓主動送房間。這次疏忽了？
2. 這次入住選擇了套餐，包括延遲退房到PM4點。可是到PM2點房卡就失效了，需要到前台刷新。而且2點以後就來打掃房間了，影響了客人午休。這個顯然是細節管理問題，需要改進。
3. 由於行程原因，2份HAPPY HOUR無法享用，希望兑換成1份早餐，被告知無法調整。這點讓我感到不解，酒店這個賬是怎麼算的？

麗晶是我認為在北京服務比較好的酒店（相比隔壁華爾道夫，在服務上並不遜色，雖然硬件差距明顯），這次提出幾點意見是希望酒店能夠看到不足之處，維護好口碑！

msg:地下車庫因防疫不能坐電梯上來，建議停地面，從北側衚衕口進入，21:00-7:00一小時5元，其餘時間10元，酒店服務很好，提前客户關係部會打電話給你聽你對房間的需求進行佈置，我要了一間視野好樓層高並有生日佈置的房間，沒有讓人失望，有氣球（憋了兩個），有蛋糕，有賀卡，有蘋果，mini bar都可以使用，純凈水給了5瓶很充足，還有膠囊咖啡，口感也不錯，馬桶蓋不是電動的，沐浴液有點不太好用，淋浴間置物的地方有點少，浴缸很舒服，室內的燈光強度稍有不夠，我預訂了乳膠枕，床墊和乳膠枕非常舒服，一秒入睡一秒醒，因為早起很痛苦沒有訂早餐所以不知道早餐如何，酒店總體不錯，如果停車體驗提前告知會更好。

大堂、服務員的各方面接待工作做的也非常到位，可以在北京市區感受到難得的高水準服務，對於南方來的朋友來説真的是超出期望的驚喜。特別裏面大堂Teresa，每次進出對小朋友的親切問候讓人心生温暖。
千元級別的酒店，

4.最令人氣憤的，亂扔住户的物品。我們買了一些故宮文創，結果第二天打掃衞生的阿姨把我們文創用品以及外賣一起扔了，到現在酒店依然説沒有，也沒給個處理方式，得虧錢包不在裏面，看到之前也有人丟了東西，清潔員是扔成習慣了還是有拿客户東西的習慣呢？

在北京高端酒店遍地 四合院民宿無數的情況下 麗晶還是值得住下體驗下的
差不多地段本來想定君悦的可能地理位置看着更好 結果看了很多評論 麗晶以早餐豐富取勝 結果也的確豐盛 還有自製薑茶 服務人員會主動詢問天冷是否需要嘗試 很貼心
定點最普通的大床房 樓層給的很高 視野很高 可以看到右上方故宮的黃瓦屋頂 送的歡迎果茶送到房間 還可以大堂吧領2份歡迎飲料 吃過晚飯人少很多大堂要壺熱茶坐會也是很舒服的 
整體服務都很贊 路遇酒店工作人員都會側身讓出主道通行  早餐廳還能聽到房號叫出x女士 早上好 細節好評  客房打掃阿姨都很熱情會主動打招呼 讓住客很有親切感
退房時會主動詢問開發票 所有細節都是訓練有素的 對的起高端酒店定位 推薦

不過要吐槽一下的是酒店按金的退回方式，三天的按金不是立即返回而是在24小時之內（指付款寶付款的按金）。那請問，付按金時也能不能在住店24小時內付款呢？顯然是不可以的吧！我想這個應該做出酒店真是以服務取勝，每一位員工都是熱情有禮貌。令我感動的是我續住的第一晚進房間，就看見服務員朱龍森親筆為我留了卡片，他看見我桌上放的葯知道我可能不舒服特地留條關心我提醒我多喝水並且多留了飲用水，這讓我很感激。而且他看見我各種小瓶零碎物件多，很細心的用一塊小白布做布墊，然後把我的小物件擺放的整整齊齊，把我掛着的數據線也用固定帶邦好了。我想這樣的員工是酒店的寶貴財富，也是酒店贏得客户的關鍵。酒店早餐也足夠豐富非常好。

免費升級了房型，視野非常棒，並且很捨得給東西，免費迷你吧，入住時給了花草茶，晚上開夜床又把用品補了一遍，性價比很高了。
服務非常貼心，入住前電話問詢了入住喜好並對房間做了調整，從入住到退房全程貼身試服務，説話也很有分寸，説實話北京的酒店能把服務做到這麼好，還很少見的。
房間來講，建議選高樓層朝西面的房間，視野不錯能看到故宮。就是室內設施有點老，這個沒有辦法，畢竟酒店建的年頭不短了，床偏軟，淋浴一般般，好在帶了電源插頭，不然衹想用數據線充電就慘了。但細節處用了不少心，特別是衞生間撲了按尺寸剪裁好的腳墊，這種貼心的設計還是第一次見。
美中不足就是停車場沒有優惠，建議停酒店邊上的地上，夜間一元一小時，比較划算。

4，下午茶用餐環境舒適明亮，李雅美經理全程接待，人如其名，優雅美麗，語言貼心温暖，提前安排座席，完全以客人預想為服務呈現，菜品精緻，每一位服務生都極其專業。各種茶品味道準確，品質優良，菜點製作精細，給人的感覺愉快，親切，舒適。
5，客房打掃及時全面，無感式，無催促，下午茶之後回房間，一切擺設物品皆如入住一刻，客房服務陳鳳清極其專業，完全以客人預想為服務呈現，自信，優秀，熱情，高效。給人的感覺親切，温暖。
6，早餐環境寬敞明亮，整潔規範，劉洋經理服務極專業，團隊訓練有素，完全以客人預想為服務呈現，早餐形式雖由自助改為點餐，但菜品品質依然保持上乘，和服務一樣，沒有任何降低，菜品味道準確，正宗，廚師水平一流，食材新鮮，餐具更換及時，給人非常良好的用餐感受。
7，離店環節，高效，專業，體會直接參照來店。完美。
簡單説重點，一，服務極其專業，以上提到的名字的工作人員，包括打掃房間的員工均可以主動以客人姓氏打招呼，如吳阿姨好，李先生好，均提前主動向過生日的客人問候生日快樂。二，早點餐廳員工手繪生日賀卡，令人感動，客房服務手寫温馨留言。温暖，親切。三，所有菜品，茶飲，依然最高水準。個人感覺超過利茲/文華/半島。

到酒店非常早 不到八點 前期諮詢提前入住需要加收半天房費
但在前台的時候 負責辦理入住的小姐姐建議升級行政房 比比半天房費還省了100元 並且多了行政酒廊以及兩份169的早餐 房間還大了許多
特別感謝辦理入住的小姐姐 名字記不清了但應該有個娟字 6.8日早上辦理的 希望酒店重點表揚一下！
已經向多位好友推薦

位置得天獨厚，步行可至王府井，樓下就是地鐵站，門前就是公交站，打車也很方便，不怎麼需要等
環境也還湊合，雖然不如王府半島璞瑄一類，但也有大面落地窗+綠植，大隱於市的感覺。
客房設施可以看出歲月的痕跡，但保持整潔。
服務是真的很好，而且給人的感覺不是那種程式化的好，而是從細節處都做的很妥帖

3.健身房洗浴區沒有浴巾，而且洗完澡才知道沒浴巾，還得求保潔大爺去外面幫我拿一條進來；
4.服務員中很大比例的中年大嬸，服務風格屬於阿姨風，不會打招呼衹知道幹活，感覺像在如家；
5.頂樓淋浴水壓很小
優點：地段好，離地鐵近…嗯，沒了。

服務方面扣一分：泳池裡衹有兩塊浮板，建議配備點游泳圈，方便小孩使用。另外早餐菜品稍有點少，質量還可以。
設施方面扣一分：衞生間和淋浴房的玻璃門很沉，且邊緣很尖鋭，小朋友關門時兩根手指夾到，雖然破點皮不算什麼，但是確實存在安全隱患。

msg:很滿意！之所以選擇這個酒店就是看服務、看口碑、看位置。帶着長者小孩來北京旅遊，設施齊全、出行方便、周邊餐飲選擇多，各項需求都能滿足，比較完美了。麗晶到底是老牌五星，服務響應快、工作人員非常細心，還會主動留意客人需要；設施保養的不錯，室內恆温泳池小朋友三四天都遊不夠，房間內設施雖然不算新，但保養的好、沒覺得破舊，床鋪被褥都很舒服，空調冷氣足，酒店還很貼心的給雙床預留了合併的選擇，這樣帶娃的家庭來了把床一併攏，就是2米4的超級大床了；早餐，中西花樣都不少，每天都有幾樣變化，看得出很用心。總之帶家人來北京旅遊的話，首選！    最後，提一個建議：可以再多準備一些單人羽絨被，加的毛毯還是沒被子舒服。三口之家來了，即使不加床，小朋友如果也能有單獨一床被子，這樣酒店真的就完美得無可挑剔了。

餐飲：辦理入住時，根據入住人員免費贈送了飲料。早餐餐品比較多，口味也不錯。可以沒有自助晚餐。
