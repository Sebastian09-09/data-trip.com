msg:I decided to visit Pujiang on a whim this weekend. The newly opened Sheraton in Pujiang is on the edge of the city. For those who like to go out and go shopping, it takes a little distance to walk, but if you drive, it is not far from various scenic spots. It is convenient to travel. The hotel ground and underground parking are also very convenient and there is no traffic. The service of the hotel staff is very warm and considerate, and there are smiling greetings everywhere. The receptionist at the door is kind and answers all questions, especially Mr. Norm who received us at the front desk. He is very nice and thoughtful, making people feel at home. I have to praise him. Linda in the restaurant is also very good. She helped us take a seat and prepared coffee. It was a very satisfactory stay experience. The hotel's service is approaching international standards. Perhaps the next step that needs to be improved may be the behavior of us tourists.

It is half an hour's drive from Yiwu High-speed Railway Station and it is very convenient to take a taxi. The hotel environment is good. There are not many people, but the service is great. Norm, the front desk service manager, is very patient and introduced the surrounding places to eat and play in detail. The hotel has a children's playground, which is very good, and there is also an indoor heated swimming pool👍! In addition, the room is clean and sanitary, and the breakfast tastes good. I may stay again next time~

It’s so unfriendly to people who go to the hotel for the first time! The quilt and pillowcases are unimaginably furnished in a five-star hotel, they are so hard! If you move it, it will be as loud as the plastic paper. Can you believe it? The bedding made you sleep all night long! The sound insulation is not good either!

Advantages:
The staff provided good service and took the initiative to upgrade the room type. The room was spacious, the decoration pattern was large, the facilities were new, and the children's toothbrush set was very good. The breakfast was rich.

Disadvantages:
Due to the material of the quilt cover and the bed sheet, turning over would cause a lot of movement and sound, which seriously affected the quality of sleep. The bed was a bit soft...

The theme of the buffet was crayfish, but the quality of the crayfish was very poor. I gave feedback to the restaurant manager, and his reply was: Our quality is similar to that of most lobster restaurants outside.
Quite speechless. As a buffet in a five-star hotel, it compares itself with the general quality of lobster restaurants outside, which lowers its own value😓

Very disappointed with such quality and such a reply...

My husband and son, who would not wake up even if there was thunder, were woken up. This shows the soundproofing effect!!! The quilt and pillow are not comfortable either. When the quilt moves, it makes a "clicking" sound, which makes us dare not move when we sleep at night. We worked very hard for a night, and we have never had such an experience staying in a hotel! I will not choose this hotel in the future. The experience is definitely not matched with the price!

可就是設施一般，那天很熱，需要開空調，但是空調一直吹熱風，維修人員來了，測試一下，説散一下就好了，酒店人員也沒有説幫忙換房間的意思。可是等了一個晚上還是很熱，哎，還帶着小寶寶根本睡不了……很不愉快的一次住酒店。

還有，掉頭時一定一定記得走輔道、走輔道，標誌標線不明顯，走錯你就完蛋了。
我就是走錯了，需要繞一大圈。
希望酒店方面跟路政、交警再溝通一下，是不是增加酒店入口，太不合理了。
