msg:Basically this hotel is quite good but there is few points I think the hotel should be notified : 
1. the staff lie us when we ask for dinner out the hotel. They told me that outside restaurants will charge us unreasonable price and ask us to take dinner at hotel. The hotel buffet charge is 3++ RMB /person (total I spend 6++ RMB in the end) but the next day I when for outside restaurant all menu are listed with price which cost reasonable price . 
2. The buffet I saw doing promotion when I check in which is 99 RMB / person with t&c. But when we ask they say this promotion is no longer having anymore. But why is u placing the promotion advertisement so big in front is u not longer having this!!!! I feel being scammed!!!! 
3. When I ask for body lotion the staff told me that they did not provide but my friend room provided!!!!! They keep saying hotel did not provided until I asked them y other room have but mine is not !!!!!!! 
4. Honestly the buffet food is not bad but just one thing the salmon section!!!!!! I Q up to take the salmon sashimi I told her I don‚Äôt want others us want salmon and I have two people can give me 6 pcs!!!! She told me that cannot!!!!!! One people only can take one plate and I is get 3 pieces of salmon and I have to take long Q again n wasted my time on eating because the bufet just until. 8 pm and I enter at 7++ .  
5. Salmon part again!!!! I almost dye because of it because there is a little bone inside the salmon sashimi!!!!! 
6. The transportation is really hard to find.. hotel should provide shuttle for nearby place. 

 Conclusion: if the hotel can correct all this mistakes I think this should be a very good staycation for me .. I wish hotel have changes for my next stay!!!

Resturant table little small, out side table little hot. Dont want set outside. I suggest eat/finish card on the desk in order to find table easily. Also need beer. In the hot spring, pls arrange more Kids items. It will be helpful for customer coming again.(Like bigger slide)
In the lobby, kids zone is useless. I think there is baby zone. Need to upgrade. Normally, kids zone is popular facility in hotel.
Thanks.

msg:As a former hotel practitioner, I haven't stayed in such a satisfactory hotel for a long time!
The room has a hot spring bath. The 1.5-meter twin room is enough for 2 adults and 2 children. Climbing plants are planted outside the hot spring bath, which not only provides shade and cools down, but also ensures sufficient privacy. There is a door in the wash area in the room. You can wash your child after coaxing him to sleep at night, and you don't have to worry about the light affecting the child. There were some minor problems at night, which needed to be handled by the housekeeping department and the engineering department. The response was very timely and the attitude was very good. They also took the initiative to remind me to close the balcony screen and be careful of mosquitoes! The room is not in the main building, but there is a corridor that leads all the way to the main building and the hot spring area, so there is no need to worry about heavy rain. There are many trees nearby and the air is good.
The breakfast and dinner buffets are very good. There are dragon fruit rice rolls for breakfast, as well as various flavors of glutinous rice cakes, and the choice of soup noodles is more than most hotels.
The hot spring area is very good, with many pools and many indoor pools. It is not afraid of rain. There are also hot springs in the children's area, with small slides and wave pools, which are enough for children to play. The design of the changing room in the hot spring area is great. Each compartment in the bathroom is spacious and clean enough. People with mysophobia are very satisfied. And once you enter, the staff will take the initiative to help arrange lockers. The staff in the hot spring area are also very proactive and will take the initiative to get tea for guests. There are also many self-service areas and dry towel areas.
Adults and children are very satisfied. They don‚Äôt want to leave after playing. It turns out that the old hot springs are well done!

msg:After at least 3 years, I stayed in Sanying for the second time, and it was still a one-bedroom villa. The yard is a cold water pool and a hot spring pool, which is quite private. The room feels better than the first time I stayed there. The TV was very old when I stayed there for the first time, which is one of the important reasons why I haven't been there for many years. I feel that the TV should have been changed this time. Because it rained, I didn't go to the outdoor hot springs, and the indoor hot springs were enough. The two nights I booked included two breakfasts and two nights. The dining experience was average, especially on Sunday morning when there were so many people. I felt that the breakfast was better than the breakfast. A small gift was given when I checked out. The hotel staff are very polite and will take the initiative to say hello.

It was very private to take a bath on the balcony. The restaurant's products were also good. Before leaving, I added Miss Lei's WeChat and promised her to come again next time. This time I brought my children to Sanying. The service was still the same. Miss Lei Shuhui arranged it very thoughtfully for us. The hot springs are still good, the restaurant's products are still delicious, and the room service is available on call. The hotel room facilities may be a little old after a long time, but it doesn't affect it. I am also very satisfied with the raw coconut latte in the lobby. I drink it every day and will come again next time.

The room has a balcony and a very good view, overlooking the mountain view. The hot spring pool in the room is very large, and the facilities and equipment are very complete. After a rest in the afternoon, I went to the cute pet area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel. There are many small animals, peacocks, bunnies, goats, etc. I also picked some vegetables next to it and cooked them at home. It was time to eat again. The place for buffet dinner was the Western restaurant on the first floor of the lobby. The layout was very grand, and there were all kinds of seafood, snacks, nutritious soups, various desserts, and small cakes that I liked. The whole family ate well and took a walk in the hotel. The wind in the evening was really comfortable and cozy. In the evening, I went to the public pool to soak in hot springs. There were many large and many functions, as well as saunas and spas. There were many fruits in the lounge. During the hot springs, the service staff also provided drinking water to replenish water. After the hot springs, I went back to the room to have a beautiful beauty sleep. It was really comfortable to get up the next morning. I had a rich buffet breakfast at the hotel, went back to the room to soak in a private soup, and spent another day. In summary, the service of the hotel was very good. During the period, the items needed in the room were also delivered to the room quickly by phone. The efficiency was very good. I will choose Sanying next time.

Service: Very good, the staff will take the initiative to smile and greet the guests when they see them.
Environment: Very beautiful, the green environment nearby is very good, and it is a good point that there are no mosquitoes in the room when the green environment is in place.
Facilities: The facilities are well maintained. The only regret is that one or two of the hot spring pools that I like to soak in are under maintenance, but it does not affect the experience. The overall experience is still very good.

What surprised me the most was that the front desk took the initiative to upgrade me to Quanyun Courtyard when I checked in. The room has a large balcony with a view of the hot spring. The room is quite large, and the bathroom and toilet are also very user-friendly, with dry and wet separation. Because I have mysophobia, I will check the hygiene as soon as I enter the room. Well, it's very clean [strong] [strong] [strong] I booked a package without a buffet dinner and chose the hotel's Chinese restaurant. You must eat chicken when you go to Guangzhou. I ordered a free-range Kaiyuan chicken "Sanying Hot Spring Chicken" and self-grinding tofu from the hotel. These two are highly recommended! The first thing that satisfied me about the morning buffet breakfast was their parent-child area, which really liberated my hands as a two-year-old mother, and I could enjoy breakfast well. By the way, there are also many varieties of breakfast. I like their spinach rice noodle rolls and raw porridge [color] I almost forgot the hot spring ‚ô®Ô∏è Next time, I must invite my girlfriends to experience the hot springs and chess and cards together. It looks so fun. The waiters are very kind and will say hello when they pass by. I will invite my girlfriends to come together next time.

Unlimited hot springs for 2 adults and 1 child: The happiest place for children is the paddling pool. In winter, they don‚Äôt want to go home while playing. When the weather is cold, lying in a tree hole or in a sauna is the most comfortable. The weather is very good. We have to go outdoors, and we haven‚Äôt finished all the hot springs on the top of the mountain. It‚Äôs a pity that we have to plan our time next time. Ha ha

Buffet dinner for two people: The buffet dinner was okay. Although it was not amazing, the ingredients were fresh and more varieties of seafood would have been perfect.

msg:It turned out that we booked the room the night before check-in, but the room rate was reduced the next day. However, the hotel automatically transferred our room back to the main building, which saved us from the discomfort. Moreover, when booking the room, we mentioned that we were traveling with elderly people with limited mobility. In addition to the connected rooms, it is also very close to the elevator entrance, which was a very considerate arrangement for us.
The room facilities are well maintained, clean, spacious and open. Just down from the main building is the hot spring area.
Maybe because it was after a holiday and it was raining, there were not too many people. It felt very comfortable to soak in the hot springs under the drizzle and cool breeze.
The spring water is hot enough and there are many types of springs. There are various teas for guests to replenish water at any time.
The porridge at the breakfast buffet is delicious. I recommend the local dried cabbage and salty bone porridge. In addition, the service and food in the Chinese restaurant on the second floor are very good.
Finally, I would like to mention Chen Xiuzhen from the front office and Zhu Priscilla from the housekeeper for their warm hospitality.

msg:I came to Sanying again after 8 years. The decoration has not changed much, but the room is really old. I made a reservation in advance, but when I checked in, I found that the hotel had changed the content. I was finally assigned to a room on the third floor of the main building with a balcony. There happens to be a layer of glass outside, which is very dirty. That is, as soon as I open the curtains, I see garbage, which feels very bad. The soaking pool in the room was very dirty, so I had to clean it and disinfect it myself before using it.
The only advantage is that there is an orchard outside the entrance of Sanying, which is very convenient for children to pick. In addition, there is also a designated area for setting off fireworks, so you can set off as much as you like at night.

There are many types of hot springs
If Hong Kong friends are very suitable
Because the drive is only within two hours
You can eat a lot of bamboo tube rice and bamboo tube rice along the way.
The hotel has a cave hot spring
There are many medicinal hot springs that are worth visiting
I will come again
The temperature difference between morning and evening is relatively large
However, there are signs of water leakage in the private hot spring bath in the hotel room, because the hot spring water in the tank will leak by itself. It is a pity, but you can turn it into hot water and soak in it, which will be no problem, but it will be a waste. The key point is that I need to use the room card to measure the water volume. There are not 2 tanks in one room, and I need to top up later.
But all in all, the staff at Nine Points are very nice and friendly.

The room has a private hot spring, and there are no restrictions on the pool to soak in. It's so comfortable. The buffet is OK, there are many styles, and there are many people during peak hours. There are games to play on the New Year‚Äôs Eve evening, with prizes for exchange, making both the older children (mothers) and the younger children happy. There is also a mini children's playground with slides. Three days and two nights of relaxation.
Special praise to Aunt Zhu Huixian who served in the room service. She brought the baby's bed rail. Knowing that the baby wanted to make milk, she enthusiastically gave her a few bottles of mineral water. She was very considerate and the baby also liked her very much.
The service was also great when we were leaving. Aunt Pan Xuexiang saw that we had two children and thoughtfully gave us two cute baby dragon dolls and a box of specialties. Sanying Hot Spring also gave away a New Year gift package. I have to say that they were very attentive. Will come again next time if I have a chance.

First of all, we stayed in Building 6, Quanyun. Because the car had to be washed (my family felt uncomfortable and vomited all over the car), we chose to take the hotel‚Äôs battery car (there were children and elderly people in our group) and waited for the car at a designated place. It was very windy. It was very cold. The hotel staff called the battery car driver for us and asked us to wait. We waited in the car for 12 minutes (it was so cold). Another wave of people came from behind and we went directly to another A battery car drove away, and I was dumbfounded! ! Then we were told that the battery car we were riding in wouldn‚Äôt drive, ****! Why don't you open the parking area? It's such a cold day. The person directing it really deserves to be criticized! ! ! ! !
Secondly, let‚Äôs talk about the public hot spring area. The hot spring water is quite dirty. I just soaked for a short time and I got a small rash on my body. It was itchy! ! uncomfortable! ! The hot spring water in the lava hot spring area is even dirtier. I won‚Äôt go there again! ! !
Today I discovered that there are small animals to see and a large vegetable patch next to the main building, and then... I also discovered a large cemetery next to it, and I suddenly felt chilled! ! ! It's really cold! ! Please be careful if you take children to see it! ! !
By the way, the child's head hit the sharp corners at the entrance, and his head became very swollen. Please smooth the tiles, it's so sharp that it hurts! ! !

My favorites are the themed hot spring pool, the cave pool that targets acupuncture points, and the underwater massage bed. After soaking, you can experience the steaming experience, which will make you feel so comfortable!
The hotel's buffet and dinner are very good, with a wide range of varieties. It's a pity that there is no ice cream. The surrounding farmhouses are quite delicious!
In the end, the service was also very good. I enthusiastically gave away herbal bags and specialties. Thumbs up.

      The environment is very good, the hotel is large, the room is clean, and the bed is quite comfortable. The only thing I feel a little regretful is that there is an eaves blocking the view from the balcony, and the private pool cannot be soaked in.
      There are many public hot spring pools, the environment is also very beautiful, the temperature is very suitable, you will not want to wake up after soaking in it, haha, it is quite suitable for taking pictures, there are several check-in points, I was too lazy to take pictures.

There are thick bath towels for self-service in the hot spring area, so you don't have to worry about catching a cold. The staff are also very prompt in helping to add water, so you can replenish water at any time; when checking out, the staff are also very timely to provide guidance.
I came here by car this time. There are restaurants and campsites around the hotel. After checking out, I can continue to play around for a while. It‚Äôs great. I will continue to come next year!

First of all, the ecological environment around the resort is very good, with fresh air and rich green vegetation. The hotel's lobby is spacious and bright, with excellent visual effects. The room was spacious, with a large balcony and comfortable beds, which made it very relaxing. The balcony is also equipped with a hot spring pool. Even if it rains heavily outside, you can enjoy the comfort of the hot spring in the room.
Secondly, the hot spring area is very close to where I live, which is very convenient. The hot spring pools have various choices, are clean and tidy, and the service attitude is good. In addition to hot spring pools, there are also facilities such as swimming pools, surfing areas, and massage pools, allowing people to enjoy a variety of different experiences.
In addition, there are many farms around the resort, where you can taste farm dishes and local specialties. If you choose the itinerary from Sunday to Monday, there will be relatively few tourists and you can enjoy a more leisurely holiday.
Overall, Sanying Hot Spring is a highly recommended resort, with excellent facilities, services and surrounding environment. If you are looking for a place to relax and enjoy the hot springs and nature, this is definitely a good choice.

The next morning, we soaked in a public hot spring for a while. There were so many pools. We didn‚Äôt go to the open-air ones very much. The kids were a little afraid of the heat, so they mainly played in the ball pool underneath. We had dinner at a restaurant outside, which was very cheap and plentiful.

This time I brought my husband and children with me. The lobby you first enter is very grand, with a big national flag hanging in the lobby. It‚Äôs perfect for this holiday season! The waiters were courteous. The selected room package includes unlimited hot springs, buffet breakfast and dinner. All other activities held in the hotel during the National Day are free~. Then, after going to the room to put our luggage, we went to the first floor for a buffet dinner. I highly recommend the souffl√©, it‚Äôs delicious! For dinner this season, I was given a coupon for one hairy crab per person. Unfortunately, the hairy crabs were all male... After resting for half an hour, I went to the hot spring area. The sisters in the hot spring area were all very hospitable. From time to time, I will ask if I want to drink water, and I need to replenish water in time. He also introduced us to the functions of each pool and reminded us which pools were not suitable for children to soak in. He was so enthusiastic. I really give it a thumbs up for this! At the breakfast buffet the next morning, the rice rolls in the restaurant were unrivaled. They were very authentic. You can try them. There were many people queuing up for rice noodles and Indian flying pancakes, so I didn‚Äôt go out of my way to eat them. Next time I have the opportunity, I will continue to bring my family to experience it. Finally, I also tried the independent soaking pool in the room, which was really comfortable. There is a curtain to maintain privacy. The room the front desk chose for us this time had a really good view, with a lawn as far as the eye could see and a night stall at night. It feels like the whole a**osphere is a combination of movement and stillness, which is very satisfying~

The safety officers are all working hard! Finally, the hotel gave us a small box of local specialty sweet potatoes. The whole family had a great time!

From checking in to visiting the hot springs, everyone we met was very enthusiastic, especially the waiter Zhang Yanling, who took the initiative to introduce the distribution and characteristics of the hotel. There was an episode in the morning, and the waiter Kuang Jinxu immediately found another person. A beautiful woman (I'm sorry I didn't ask her name clearly) helped to solve the problem. After check-out, Zhao Sumei from the front desk helped to deliver it to the door. It was a very warm experience! PS: It would be better if the room can prepare children's slippers!

Generally, if you come late, make a reservation for the morning and evening buffets.
The hot spring pool is also very comfortable, the water is clean, and the service staff Kuang Jinxu is also very good. Someone will give you water after 10 minutes of soaking.

msg:I booked the room almost a month in advance. Later, I wanted to cancel it for some reasons, but the hotel refused to cancel it. After thinking about it, I decided to check in as scheduled.

Service: When I got the room, I told the front desk to try to arrange for a room with a view. I also filled in the reservation notes. The front desk promised that it would be no problem and the view was good. But when I went to the room, I saw only one thing outside the window. Platform, your hotel doesn‚Äôt know what it means to not tell directly, don‚Äôt deceive guests, right? I have a room that costs almost 2,000 a night, can you show me the platform? Doesn‚Äôt your conscience hurt? Moreover, we were not told any details about the hotel during the whole journey, such as what time the meal was, where the room card was, etc. If we told it, we might be laughed at. It wasn‚Äôt until around 11pm that the cleaning lady came over and saw us looking for it. Without the room card, we used the hot spring card to turn on the lights. We were reminded that the room card was stored in the cabinet.
Moreover, I kept calling the front desk or other calls when I needed to, but no one answered. I had to keep calling, just to get the hotel to provide a child's toothbrush. After waiting for a long time, what was delivered was an adult toothbrush, as well as children's slippers. It's a big pair. I advise parents with children to bring all the children's supplies. There are almost no supplies suitable for small children here.
Let‚Äôs talk about breakfast. When I arrived at 9:30, I was told that the original buffet was full. You could go to the side to dine. There was also food there. But when I went there, I saw that there were only a few things to eat, and many things were not available. The only comparison The only thing that attracted me was the noodle soup, and I had to wait in a long line to get it. In the end, the whole family just had fried noodles + yogurt.

Environment: None of the family is too mysophobic, so we can just muddle along. However, there is an ant hole in the private bathing pool. From the time the water is put in to the time of soaking, I have been watching ants crawling around.

Tickets for public area hot springs: There are only a few waiters in the hot springs. In several hot spring pools, some people are seen throwing their finished water cups in. Even the gentleman who is not mysophobic does not want to take a bath, and he has soaked in it so many times. For the first time in a hot spring, even the bathrobe was stolenüòÖI was speechless

I met a few more enthusiastic waiters, all of whom wanted to comment on the enthusiasm that can only be found in five-star reviews, rather than like other hotels where they feel at home.
Based on the above, I will not come again, nor would I recommend it to others around me.

I asked several times to take the bottle down the next morning, but even stopped me several times and chased me to the elevator entrance to ask for the bottle. I have stayed in five-star hotels in all countries, and some hotels will even say that it doesn't matter and don't bother. However, your hotel has such stupid management. It is a simple calculation question to decide which is more important, how many cents are recovered, and how the guests feel. In addition, the hotel probably didn't hire a lighting designer from the lobby to the restaurant to the rooms, so it was very dark.

And the water in the room, two bottles are free, two bottles cost eight yuan. If someone accidentally drinks the two eight yuan bottles, the two bottles are free, what do you say? Is it tempting? There are also those claw machines downstairs. I grabbed two hundred yuan, haven‚Äôt I caught them yet? The thing I just found flew away and fell under the bottom of the plane. I couldn't catch it or get it. Then take the machine away and I can't pick it up at all. What do you think I should do? How many coins did I lose? Are you going to pay me or what? One thing is that the toilet is too dark. What if someone falls? It smells like breakfast, and the quality is getting worse and worse. It's far worse than before. What kind of celebrity canteen is this? Now it's like a beggar eating. There is also a hot spring. There is too much garbage and it is not hygienic at all. Some people ran away after pooping and peeing. In terms of service, I asked them to bring a bathrobe and four bottles of water, but in the end they brought a razor. What do you want me to say? There is also the blanket in the corridor and the suitcase that the customer pulls is very uncomfortable and strenuous. It is recommended to improve it. And the hygiene near the swimming pool is very poor. There are paper cups everywhere and no one cleans them up. Originally it felt so-so. The environment is good, but the service attitude is not particularly good. It took tens of thousands of minutes for someone to deliver something. Especially the website, the nearby residents kept shouting and it was so noisy. The sound insulation is not very good either. Especially those who start work early will definitely be affected.
        Finally, I wish you a prosperous business!

I made complaints about the room. The big four and one small one booked more than 2,000 double-bed villas, but it turned out to be a one-bedroom and one living room, with a bed in the living room. The privacy is very poor, and the sound insulation between the room and the living room is poor. The ventilation in the toilet is also poor, and the room often smells of sewers, so it is not recommended to book a villa. The private pool is not used much. Children like to play in the water. It is good to experience it. There is a high probability that they will not book again next time. The buffet dinner is quite satisfactory, but it does not meet the taste of the elderly. You can directly eat the farmhouse outside the hotel. The choice is delicious and not expensive.
Finally, I would like to commend Ms. Qiu, Zhang Yanling, Zhao Sumei from the front office, and Wu Xiaoqin from the western restaurant by real names. I wish you all the best in your work.

Each pool has different functions and can soak from day to night. The hotel also has two relatively large swimming pools, which are very suitable for children of all ages; there is also a steam room, which is very comfortable after steaming for a while. The room I stayed in this time has an independent soup pool. Watching the stars while soaking in the evening is another view. The hotel service is very good, some accommodation rooms are far away, and you can also arrange a battery car pick-up. There are quite a variety of buffet styles in the hotel.

It was really amazing. The service of a hotel priced at 1,200 yuan was not as good as that of a hotel with a price of less than 1,000 yuan. Go to a hotel for 200 yuan!

1. The hotel room is relatively large, with two separate compartments for toilet and shower, which is very good and comfortable overall.
2. Service, the waiters are all very good, they will greet you when they see you, and will ask if you need help when they see you with your luggage. When I was soaking in the hot spring at night, I met Kuang Jinxu who patiently explained and recommended it to us, thumbs up.
3. In terms of food, the group meal I bought did not have a buffet dinner, so I bought a 408 for two adults and one child at **. The buffet dinner has many varieties and tastes good. The breakfast buffet is included in the room, but I didn't expect that the breakfast variety is also many and delicious.
4. Hot springs, we are afraid of heat, so we went to soak at night. There are more than a dozen pools, which are not bad overall. The children like the fish therapy the most.
The disadvantage is that it has free parking, but the cars are parked on the road, which is a bit sunny.
In general, I will go to Sanying Hot Spring again and recommend it to my friends. I am generally satisfied.

The overall feeling is good, the best thing is the waiters inside, all of them speak softly and answer questions politely. There are also many outdoor pools. If you want to try a few more pools, you have to reserve the time and go to the pool early. Then the room I lived in was basically covered by green plants, and the air was so fresh that I felt the urge to live there for a day. It should be a hot spring hotel that has been open for a long time. The room is a bit old, and there is no plug for directly plugging in the data cable. I will remember to bring it next time, but it is convenient to ask the front desk to send it over.

The key point is that the buffet dinner is great, and the breakfast category is also good. The food is really rich.
The location of the hotel is very good. It takes less than 10 minutes to drive to Forest Sea and Baishui Village.

A little suggestion, the swimming pool will open after 4:30 pm, what can you do during the day when summer comes? I feel that we need to get more cooperation with water parks, and get more discounted packages, which are best included in the morning and evening, haha.
In addition, there are few outlets in the room.

Although the hot spring is summer, the hot summer can't stop our enthusiasm for soaking in the hot spring!!! There are a variety of pool water available, and the waiter also took the initiative to come over to provide tea and greet us when passing by.

As for the environment of the hotel, needless to say, it is surrounded by mountains and cleans the lungs first-class. There is also a small farm, where you can see mini pigs, deer, rabbits, goats, and chickens

This is our first time to go, the overall experience is very good, we are very relaxed and will come againüòÅ

Check-in is fast, the room is clean, the staff is polite, the buffet is rich in food, and I am full for 3 days
In the hot spring area, children are most attracted to the wave pool and the slide area, which is also a hot spring, and they will not be afraid of catching cold after playing for a long time. And now that the cute pet paradise has been newly built, children can interact with small animals, and besides soaking in hot springs, they will have more fun.
Special thanks to the two staff members Zhang Raojie and Li Wenli for providing caring services for me and my family during this stay!

There are many hot spring pools, including slides, bird cages, various Chinese medicine pools, red wine pools, milk pools, etc. There is also a small children's playground next to the lobby on the first floor, which is suitable for children to play. Walking outside the lobby for about 5 minutes, you can go to the Cute Pet Paradise to interact with the small animals. The children had a great time; the service here is also very good, especially the sister Kuang Jinxu in the hot spring area, the sister Zhu Huixian in the guest room, and the lobby staff. Sister Pan Xuexiang, made us feel at home.
Public area hot spring tickets: unlimited use, but we only went once

msg:This is my worst experience in the Zengcheng hot spring area. I used the money of a five-star hotel to enjoy the trea**ent of a three-star hotel.
1. There are a lot of people in the hot spring area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel, but many of them are not hotel guests. Most of them are casual guests. There are a lot of square dancing aunts in the hot spring area who are buying group purchases and just enjoying the hot spring. It is a scene where the aunts can use the pool. Instead of staying in Sanying to soak in hot springs, it is better to stay in a small hotel next door and buy Sanying Hot Spring tickets in a group.
2. The house in the villa area doesn't even have lockers. Clothes, snacks, tea cups, all the items are spread out all over the room. The longer I stay, the more upset I become.
3. The attitude of the waiter is very bad. It may be because there are too many bad customers. The hotel lobby manager responded to a simple inquiry with a very cold attitude and said directly, "Ask the front desk."
It can be said that Sanying Hot Spring has grown up with my children, staying there almost every year. However, it is a pity that every year is not as good as the previous year. In recent years, small gifts have been given out at check-out to gain good reviews, which cannot cover up the serious decline in the quality of the hotel.
This time I decided not to give any gifts from the hotel and wrote down the actual situation in the hope that Sanying would get better again.

The customer service at the front desk told me that if she agreed to cancel one night, Ctrip would not refund the money. Give me the money, so I would rather not refund it. So I contacted Ctrip customer service to solve the problem. Seven of my family and friends spent an hour at the front desk because of this matter. I just entered the breakfast queue and was informed that it would end at 10 o'clock before I even got the food. The front desk did not inform me when I checked in. Bad review, no next time.

msg:The worst hotel ever stayed in a hotel with a price of 1,000 yuan! Will not live a second time! I arrived at the hotel at 2:30 that day to check in. After arriving at the door of the room, I waited for about 40 minutes before the waiter came to clean up the room where the previous family lived. Considering that the staff may be too busy during the peak season, they will not pursue it. When the staff cleans up the room, they take the clothes and take the children to the hot spring area to play in the water first. However, the facilities in the room are outdated, and the stains on the floor look particularly sloppy. There are indeed scum on the floor, and the sink of the sink is still broken. There are only two small bottles of 350ml water in the room. If you put two more bottles, you will not go bankrupt. Bar? ! I have never seen such a stingy hotel! ! The air conditioner cools down very slowly! The temperature in the room reached 27.5 degrees last night. I lowered the temperature of the air conditioner to 22 degrees, but there was no sign of cooling down. I called the front desk at 11:00 p.m. to arrange for an engineer to come and check it. The temperature will slowly drop after hours. Good guy, I woke up several times in one night, and when I woke up early in the morning, the temperature dropped to 26.5 degrees! In addition, the breakfast is 138/person. Although the variety seems to be quite large, it is really unpalatable. The soy milk and milk are mixed with too much water, which is very thin! The family members ate a bowl of noodle soup that was overcooked and all the noodles were broken, and it was not easy to pinch. In addition, they ate two hair-like things in the ai ci. We informed the waiter, she said sorry, and quickly took Ai Ci away with her bare hands... I really don't understand where there are so many good reviews? This time I really fell into the pit! ! But one thing to say is that the hot springs are really good. There are many pools. After playing for two days this time, I saw that the pools are relatively clean. Only the service of the hot spring depar**ent makes people feel good. The other service staff I encountered were too poor and had no sense of service. For example: I made up the extra breakfast for two people before the meal on February 2. I told the cashier that I would issue an invoice. I stood by and waited, she first collected the money from the customers behind and then billed me... What was going on in my mind? I don't know how to let the guests go in for breakfast first, and send the tickets after they are issued? The experience is really terrible!

I don't think the bathrobe has been replaced with a new one? Because of the stain on it, it came off as soon as I washed it with water. The buffet is a bit average for my taste. The good thing is that the hot spring water in the yard can be used as many times as you want. I didn‚Äôt go to the public hot springs, and the facilities look pretty good. In the morning, the air in the mountains is fresh.

The fishbone got stuck in the fish, and I couldn't spit it out no matter how I tried it. Later, I asked the front desk, but I didn't expect that there were tweezers, so I got it out. Fireworks were also set off, and sweet potatoes were given away at check-out. It was a pleasant trip.

It took more than an hour to drive from Dongguan to arrive at the hotel. The environment is very good, but it happened to be rainy, so I didn't go to the surrounding Baishuizhai attractions. The hotel service staff are very friendly and polite. We stayed in the room on the fifth floor of Building 1 of Tingquan Pavilion. A male waiter helped us move our luggage and gave us a hot spring medicine package. The balcony of the room faces outside, and you can see the distant mountain view, and you can occasionally see fireworks at night. The private hot spring on the balcony is also good. After soaking, I feel that it is a real hot spring, and it has some effects. I didn't go to the public hot spring because I had a wound on my body. I feel like I can come again next time!

msg:This is the fifth time I have come to Sanying Hot Spring Hotel, but this time it is the most expensive and also the most disappointing. The cleanliness of the room is too poor and the water temperature of the hot spring is not enough. The family complained that it was not worth the price of more than 1,000. The only thing I feel fortunate is that the hot spring pool outside is okay, there are few people, and it is hygienic.

One of them didn't want to go in the hot spring and wanted to go in because of the child. He didn't agree, so I had to pay for two hot spring tickets. I had to queue for everything for breakfast... there are many swimming pools. The facilities are not open. The bathrobe in the room was smelly and I suspected it had not been washed. There were so many mosquitoes that I was bitten badly after sitting on the balcony for a while.

msg:The first time I came to Zengcheng to take a hot spring, I chose Sanying after repeated comparisons. I felt that I chose the right one. The hotel is close to Baishui Village. It is really comfortable to climb the mountain and take a hot spring. There are many hot spring pools in the hotel, both indoor and outdoor. The staff are very polite and attentive. They help to deliver water and take towels. Sister Wu Wen, the waiter in the hot spring area, also intimately introduced the characteristics of the hot spring area and the precautions for taking a hot spring, which is greatly praised. In terms of eating, the hotel's breakfast is very rich, there are many choices, and the taste is also very good. I went to the Chinese restaurant in the evening, and the products are also very good. I recommend the hot spring chicken and loofah, bamboo and plum soaked wonton. . In terms of guest rooms, although the equipment is a bit old, they are all clean and tidy. I would like to praise the shower room. The shower has enough water, the water heats up quickly, and the bathing is very comfortable. There is a mountain view outside the balcony. The birds are chirping outside, which is very pleasant. When we checked out, the manager Pan in the lobby also gave us a gift. If I have the opportunity to come to Zengcheng again, I will choose Sanying.

Service: The uncles and aunts here are very enthusiastic. As soon as they arrived, they gave the children two small national flags, and then gave a few cans of Sprite to play small activities, went to the hot spring area to kiss the fish pond, and praised Zhang Yanling, the waiter and aunt, and sent them from time to time. Luo Han Guo tea is especially warm to children. There is also Zhao Sumei from the front office in the lobby, which makes us feel like home.
Hot spring area: The facilities are quite rich. Anyway, the children have a good time and the water is relatively clean. The husband went to soak in the pool that removes dampness and activates blood, and said that the gout foot was much better and less painful. And I was very tired after soaking in the hot springs. The husband said it was a real hot spring. Will come again.

The car was returned to the account as soon as the car opened the door of the hotel, etc. These are all good. There are also problems: 1. Cockroaches were found in the room, and the shower room in the room had a strong smell of urine. It is recommended that the disinfection trea**ent should be thorough. I thought it was hygienic. 2. The privacy of the entrance of the big bed room is not good. Clothes are very inconvenient; 3. There are many pools in the public hot spring area, and there are also many swimming pools for children to play in. It is recommended to add some advanced children's water play facilities and ground children's park unpowered facilities (refer to Bishuiwan, Forest Sea , Xile Valley, etc.), constantly innovating to attract children to play; 4. It is very inconvenient to bind the hotel room card with the hot spring. After first checking out, you cannot enter the public hot spring without the room card. The pool has to swipe the card to put hot water, so I can't take a bath in the room by myself (there are only two room cards in each room, the child and dad took them to the outdoor hot spring to play with the card), and I couldn't even get out of the door. There is no room card to go back to the room after going out. The hotel should consider solving the needs of the guests and provide the room card separately; 5. The dining experience is relatively poor. There is always a queue, and the quality of the food is very average. It is recommended to expand the catering reception capacity; 6. The service awareness of the restaurant staff is very poor! The biggest problem of this trip is the restaurant service. I used two adult meal coupons (the value is equivalent to half price for 4 children) redeemed by Ctrip to deduct the 3 half price children's meals of the companions. The service staff said no, only A meal coupon goes to a child, and at the end of the negotiation for a long time, although a person in charge finally came and said that this can be done, my husband has already given up his breakfast and returned to the room (by the confusing logic and sophistry of the previous few people who came forward to solve the problem. I'm so angry, I can't quarrel with women, so I have to lose), may I ask your hotel to entertain three half-price children with three adults' meals, is this in line with the price bureau's charging regulations? What's more, how to improve consumers' awareness of service? Can the reasonable demands of guests be dismissed by simply saying "the hotel has regulations"? Shouldn't the service be people-oriented? Rules are dead and people are alive, not to mention that these rules are the overlord clauses that you set? In addition, when the hotel restaurant staff solved the problem, they said in a disdainful tone that your two adult meal coupons were not exchanged by Ctrip. The implication was that I didn't spend money on the meal coupons, and I felt that I had taken advantage of it, so why would I be embarrassed to talk about my appeal here? May I ask if I redeem hotel meal vouchers from Ctrip for my consumer rights? Is it my consumer rights? Upgrade real money to diamond membership in exchange for the rights I should have. How can I be despised by you, and I don‚Äôt deserve to enjoy legitimate rights and interests? It is recommended that hotels strengthen comprehensive training for restaurant service staff! This time, because of this matter, I don't plan to go again, nor do I plan to recommend friends or team building to arrange the Sanying Hotel. The guests' own rights and interests are damaged, and they are a little bit idle!

I chose Sanying between Jinye and Sanying, who had never lived. Later it turned out to be too wise, the hotel quite meets my requirements, the air is good, the greening is good, the children's play space in the hot spring area is large, and the children love the surfing pool and the wave pool. The design of the massage pool is very good. A circle of cold water in the middle allows children who are afraid of heat to concentrate in the middle to play, and parents enjoy hot spring massage while watching their children around. It is very comfortable to listen to the frogs croaking with the mountain wind blowing in the high mountain hot spring at night. I didn't try the Korean-style steaming. The evening buffet food is also good, mainly cooked food, especially the beef steak. The service staff of the hotel are very polite, and the battery car is also very timely to pick up and drop off. However, it is recommended that it is convenient to drive by yourself if you don't live in the main building. Finally, I praise the sanitation of the hot spring area is very good and the room is very comfortable. I will visit again next time I have the opportunity.

There are green hills and peaks outside the door, soaking in hot springs on the balcony, watching the twilight of the mountains, the breeze is coming, and the eyes are full of green, it is really a small blessing in the world!

The reception at the front desk is very polite, and the waiters are very friendly. Seeing our family of three, they upgraded the mountain view room in the main building for free. It is very convenient to go to the hot spring area, swimming pool, and dining. The check-in and check-out speed is very fast. The room is simple and clean, the layout is warm and reasonable, the shower room and toilet are separated from wet and dry, and the balcony has a good view. Swimming, the hot spring area is fully equipped, no need to bring towels, shower, change clothes, free storage is very convenient, free fruit and tea are provided. The swimming pool has several areas, adults and children have suitable pools, and there is a lot of entertainment every day The project has a very lively a**osphere. You can try it on the Internet Red Bridge, which is a bit interesting. The hot spring area is very large, with many hot spring pools of different temperatures and themes. Unfortunately, the weather is too hot recently. I have only tried a few, and the experience is good. I will try it again when the weather is cold. The buffet breakfast food is rich, fresh, tastes good, and there are plenty of seats. All in all, this is a very satisfying vacation experience, and Sanying Hot Spring is worth recommending.

At 6:30 last night, my husband drove me and my son to the hotel to have a buffet. The tire punctured on the way. I had no choice but to take the child to the buffet. The husband changed the tire himself. Because it was late and the light was not good, it was very difficult to change the tire alone. It took a lot of effort, and the clothes were soaked. Fortunately, the manager of the greening depar**ent of the hotel passed by and helped the husband to change together. In this sultry weather, he gave selfless help to the guests, and he did a good thing afterwards without leaving his name. To make guests feel at home, I decided to write about this here, so that more people know that the service quality of Sanying Hot Spring Hotel is very high.

The hotel is divided into several areas. I booked the Tingquan Pavilion hot spring room. The room is a bit far from the hot spring, but it can be connected through the promenade to the hotel lobby and the hot spring area. It is not afraid of getting wet when it rains, and the guidelines are very clear. First come will not get lost. The room looks a little old and a little old, but the hygiene is good, and it will not feel uncomfortable. The hot spring pool on the terrace is very large, and it can be soaked in an infinite pool, so that children can play with water at any time. is the sound insulation is a bit poor, the door opening and closing in the next room is noisy.
   The hot spring area is very large, there are many pools, and all of them are basically open, so the water quality will not feel turbid. In the evening, there were a lot of people, and there were wave pools and rocking bridge activities. Both adults and children had a great time. I am most satisfied with the steam room series. There are bath stone steaming, mist steaming, and Korean-style steaming area. The room is very large and the steam is full. After sweating, I feel refreshed. For this steaming room, I will do it again next time. Will come again!

This time I booked a room with private soup, but it was actually unnecessary. The hot springs in the public area are very good. There are more than 70 pools, as well as slate rooms, fog therapy, caves and other different tricks. There are almost no people who go there early in the morning. The warm and thoughtful service of Kuang Jinshu from the Hot Springs Depar**ent gave him a five-star praise!

The children like it very much. The room is very large and a family of four is very comfortable. The hotel's hot spring has an artificial wave pool, which children like very much. The children's pool is also very good. The other various medicinal baths are similar to other hot springs. It is worth mentioning that the pebble bath and Korean steam steam, as well as the cave hot spring, compare special. The details of the hotel are considered more thoughtful. The door card is designed with a bracelet, which is convenient to carry out and can also be used to open the cabinet of the hot spring. The one-card card feels very convenient. The only mediocre thing is the buffet at night, which is average. Overall, I think it is a very good hotel, and will come again next time.

msg:This is my first time evaluating a hotel, let's talk about the overall feeling first: one word - value!
Let's talk about why:
I have been to no less than ten hot spring hotels in the surrounding areas and cities of Guangzhou, all of which are quite good. But Sanying is the one that feels the best so far.
1. Hot Spring: To our surprise, it has an artificial cave hot spring area, which is clean, beautiful and comfortable. There are no fallen leaves in the water, the cave is well ventilated, very clean, I like it very much! There are also boat-shaped hot springs, bird's nest hot springs... very good!
2. Housing: I didn't like the annex building first, but then I chose the main building, a four-star, 1099 double bed 1.5 meters 50 square meters big room, a family of four lived comfortably and satisfied.
3. Meals: a buffet for 2 people is included. My eldest son and I have had breakfast. It is not bad, but there are 4 people in our family, and the meal for each additional person will cost more than 100 yuan, and 2 people will add more than 200 yuan. Forget it. It's more cost-effective to eat out. I didn't eat the hotel dinner and wasted 2 places üòÉ
4. Surrounding food: There is a local food street about 800 meters away. On the first night, I went to eat authentic bamboo chicken and bamboo rice. It is 230 yuan for three large and one small. It is not expensive and delicious! At noon the next day, I went to another restaurant for roast chicken, 210 yuan, delicious!
5. Touched: I went to take pictures with my wife early the next morning when there were few people around. I met an intern who was a cleaning lady. She had studied photography, she was very professional, and the key was very enthusiastic. She helped us take a lot of photos, my wife Very satisfied! Thank you again Miss! Suggestion to Sanying Hotel: take Miss Sister after her internship, next time we come, ask her to help take picturesüòÄüòÄüòÄ
5. Plan: I will come again for the winter vacation. Anyway, I will come again several times.
6. Suggestion: Everyone's experience and experience may be different. The above is only the real feeling of our family, not necessarily accurate and comprehensive, and is for reference only.

Not much nonsense: the price/performance ratio with a separate pool is good, if your baby is a baby or 1-8 years old, you can do it. There's no need to go out and squeeze other people unlimited times. Just soak in the room by yourself, our family of three soaked 3 times. There are also going out to experience unlimited hot springs, unlimited hot springs have a good environment and multiple pools. But there are really a little more people, and I have a baby and a mobile phone. After returning to the room, I really enjoyed the independent pool. Soaked again at 12pm and again the next morning. However, the soundproofing of Quanwa's room is average. After all, the balcony is not sealed. Quanwa is in the main building, which is very convenient. Rush and you're done. There will be a second time.

ü§™Backgroundsü§™
         Two poor people who have not been in hot springs since 2019 because of the epidemic. A poor old mother with a baby. An old father who can't play well with his baby. A little expert who will seriously write reviews.

üò∑ Epidemic prevention and control: scan the code, measure the temperature to enter and exit. Follow-up breakfast reminders to wear masks, and even distribute masks during inspections, which is considerate. satisfy.
üöó Transportation: Depart from Huadu at 11:30 and arrive around 12:40. Navigation is accurate. It is an off-peak travel, so be fast, accurate and ruthless.

üßπHygiene: The aunt in charge of the 8342 area is relatively friendly, but when I found a hair on the pillow and hoped to replace it, the aunt said that it could not be replaced, and I understood, although the peak was wrong. But there are still a lot of people. Notify the switchboard to collect the garbage after the take-out meal, and after 10 minutes of walking around, the garbage has been collected. It's a diligent auntie.


üîîService:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Front desk: After arriving, many people check out. There are three front desks and 6 staff members. They can take the room after 13:30. After arriving at 13:40+, there are also many people checking in, waiting in line for about 20min+. Neither fast nor slow.
2Ô∏è‚É£Miss [Lin Huoying] from the hot spring depar**ent is very diligent and has a good working attitude. When she was drinking water, she was very fond of seeing her taking the initiative to replenish towels with her colleagues. After the children get into the water, they are reminded to pack towels quickly and drink more water. My face was red from being soaked for so long. And very gentle, asked if we were here for the first time, and gave us a detailed introduction to the entire hot spring hotel with pride. Made me feel good about this hotel up up up!
3Ô∏è‚É£Wandering around at night, the security guard at the door greeted us very nicelyüòÇ It was really a home away from home, and I felt that I was taken seriously.
4Ô∏è‚É£ There were not many people checking out. [Zhao Sumei] The concierge greeted me with a smile and asked me how I felt about my stay, and if I had any comments. It can be seen that the training of the hotel is very good. Every employee is very attentive and cares about the guest's feelings.
5Ô∏è‚É£ The little brothers and sisters of the breakfast buffet are very diligent.

I have a background in tourism management. Although I have changed careers, I also know that the wine management industry is not easy. To be honest, it is also the first time I have stayed in a hotel of more than 1K. But in Sanying you can see the management level and requirements. At the same time, it can be seen that the hotel has its own culture (hahaha, habitually read the hotel brochure)


‚ô® Unlimited hot springs for two people ‚ô®
There are many pools, there is a children's pool, and the children are very happy. After playing with the children, I will go back to the room to re-bubble. There is a massage pool, because with children, I didn't try it. General medicated bath, broodstock have. The whole mountain is so big. Really rare üòÇ Children above 1.2 charge.

ü´ïBreakfast üçù
The package comes with a double breakfast, and there are many styles. There are cold salad, hot food, western style. Drinks are also very rich, all kinds of milk, tea, everything is available. Children 1.2 and above are charged.

Dinner üç≥
Saw the propaganda is oyster-themed. But I felt that the price was a little expensive, so I chose takeaway for dinner on the 8th. There is a choice of takeaway nearby, which I really feel good about. Grateful to live in this era


above. Very satisfied with this trip. In fact, it was also a dazzling surprise. Will come again. I think, in fact, no matter how much I write, it will be more important than anything else. You can choose with confidence.

On the first day, the lady at the front desk helped me check in very quickly, and I could enter the room immediately. This is really great, go to the villa area It's clean and hygienic. We are very satisfied, but at noon the next day, we wanted to call to order food at the Chinese restaurant, but what I didn't expect was the lady who answered the phone. She told me that it was the peak meal time, so she might send it over About 1:30, she suggested that I can come to the Chinese restaurant for dinner. I said we can wait. You can deliver it after 1:30. I asked the lady to read what special dishes on their menu. After the lady brought it over, she sighed inexplicably, "Alas". I asked her if she was not satisfied with the meal I ordered and delayed her. I asked her if You don't like our food service, why does the phone show that you can order food, but the hotel doesn't deliver food to the room? ? In the end, they helped me book it and deliver it to my room. In the evening, after the lunch ordering turmoil, we went to the Chinese restaurant to eat at 8 o'clock that night, but we met this "oh" young lady again. The dishes take about 40 minutes, which means you don't even want to give me the equal number paper. My God, there are only two numbers waiting in front of you. There is still an hour before you close the business. Miss, you don't even have the chance to wait for a table Give me! ! You know that we don't want to drive 2 kilometers away for dinner at night. You told us not to wait in such a tone. I want to ask such a big hotel, if you haven't closed, tell us not to take a number and wait! ! What's the situation? I know that there are not enough service staff and it's a holiday, so we are all willing to wait, but the lady can't tell us that she doesn't want to serve! In fact, don't be so stubborn in your service words, you don't have enough service staff. I can serve myself after I sit down. Great, all Chinese restaurant products are fine, but the lady made me afraid to come back to Sanying Chinese restaurant for dinner! ! On the whole, Sanying Hot Spring Villa is very good. I need to mention a little more. How convenient it is to get a QR code in the room to order food in the future. I look forward to my visit next time. I can see your improvement! !

If you see a wet towel, you will take the initiative to bring a dry one. Here, I would like to thank Lin Huoying, Zhang Yanling, Huang Shaorong, and Guo Kunhua for their care and concern. They are very human and make our experience here very good.

msg:#The Internet celebrity hot spring hotel with many springs and ponds near Zengcheng Baishui Village üè®#
On the 28th night of the twelfth ***** month, I drove to this hotel to take a hot spring. I arrived at 7:00 pm. There were many parking spaces. There are also battery cars to pick up and drop off between each accommodation area, and the service was very timely.
Hotel: I live in Building 7 of Quanyunju, and the entrance to the hot spring is at the door, which is very convenient. The room is relatively new, the internal area is quite large, and there are other facilities. The heating effect of the air conditioner, the temperature of the hot water in the rain, and the sound insulation effect of the room are all good. The view from the balcony and corridor is very good, but the location of the electricity card is not there The door and the bedside table are not very convenient.
Hot springs: There are dozens of pools in the hot spring area, which are divided into cave areas, ancient medicinal bath areas, beauty areas, Confucian hot spring areas, etc. In the evening, except for the cave area, which was a little more crowded, many of the other pools were empty and soaked a lot. It is comfortable and quiet. The temperature of the pool is between 40.5-42, which is suitable for the human body. After soaking for an hour and a half, I feel very relaxed and comfortable. Then I eat some fruit and go back to my room to sleep.
On the whole, I am very satisfied. The surrounding air is good, the hot spring pools are of various types, the room is comfortable, and the breakfast is rich. It is worth recommending!

Explaining the situation, the reason for the waiter at the entrance is to report when going out, the restaurant can only enter once, there is no stipulation for this, and there is no staff to explain and remind us about this when we check in. This is the first time I have encountered this in a hotel. I have to report, and I have booked a room of 1130+. Actually, the service is so bad that Sanying is really bad. I don't recommend going.

1. The area of the cafeteria is much larger than that of Xiangjiang, with more food and better taste. The waiters are more proactive in removing dishes.
2. The hot spring area sees more details about Sanying, the water is cleaner, the waiters diligently and proactively bring tea to the guests by the hot spring pool, but Xiangjiang did not.
3. The design of the hot spring area is high-grade, karst cave style, tree cave style, mountain top style... More categories can be selected, the weather is cold in the karst cave area, it is not afraid of rain and it is much warmer.
4. In other respects, I will not make too many comparative comments.

If the temperature is a little lower, it will be very cold to return to the room after soaking in the hot spring, because the walk is a bit far, and the wind is strong on the mountain.

msg:It is the first time to take a child to a hot spring, and I booked a twin room in the main building (a balcony with a separate hot spring pool). The hotel is surrounded by mountains, the ambient air is good, the rooms are well decorated, clean and hygienic. There are many hot spring pools, and you can't finish soaking in one night, and there are also hot spring recreation pools for children. There are places where drinking water and dry towels are provided everywhere in the hot spring area. The waiters have a good attitude. In the steam room, the waiters often come in to deliver water. The next morning, you can also enjoy the hot spring addiction in the independent hot spring on the balcony. After the meal, Pan Jingqi, the director of the western restaurant, came over to inquire about the check-in experience and improvement suggestions; Zhao Sumei from the front office was very enthusiastic to guide us to lead Zengcheng specialty products to eat Caixin, and also helped us put the luggage on the car. Generally speaking, the trip was very enjoyable, and I will consider coming back next time.

msg:It is found that many of them are staying in the form of team building. There are many hot spring pools, and there is no end to soaking. Children also have a large pool with a degree of more than 30 degrees for fun, which has a design feature. I drank four types of tea. The next morning there were few people going there, and the waiter Zhang Yanling asked about the situation. After checking out, I found that the score reviews will have gift feedback. The waiter throughout the hotel will greet each other. As shown in the picture, Tingquan Pavilion 1 is the closest to the main building, and the back building goes up the mountain, the farther you go to the hot spring, but the privacy is good. The sun shines on the green vines on the balcony, which is very eye-catching. One side of the villa area is all under construction, and the other side feels more deserted rather than quiet. Overall, I feel that the hot spring has its own characteristics that make people feel more impressed. Why are there no children‚Äôs toothbrushes in the guest room? There is no decent children‚Äôs playground, and breakfast is more expensive than a hot spring.

But what makes me feel the most is that the entire hotel lobby, the environment near the hotel and the facilities in the hot spring make me feel very satisfied. It really realizes the phrase "give you a five-star home". I have to say here that the buffet dinner products are very rich, and there are many varieties, even if you try to eat each spoon, you can get back to the cost, you can eat the wall ü§óü§ó, plus the product can be supplemented in time. Speaking of the hot spring area, there are also large and small pools to choose from, especially the massage pool is very good, with many massage functions. In addition, there are two more distinctive pools, one is the jade bath and the medicine smoked pool. The battery car for pick-up and drop-off can also be delivered at any time, so there is a lot less waiting time. Here I also offer a little suggestion: Be more careful with the service. If the swimming pool is heated and the surfing pool is open, it will be even better! I look forward to seeing the perfection of Sanying Hot Spring Resort when I visit again!

You can soak in the hot spring as many times as you want. The room is equipped with a variety of health-preserving medicine packs for bathing in the pool. The hot spring water is very hot and soaks. Have fun; eating here is convenient. The hotel has Chinese and Western restaurants to choose from. For dinner, we eat free-range chicken at the farm next to the hotel; the next day, the hotel‚Äôs buffet breakfast is very good, although it is not a weekend or a holiday, there are many varieties and everything you need. It's better than many five-star hotels, but I went a bit late, and many didn't have time to eat.

msg:This is a perfect hot spring trip. Sanying Hot Spring is the first choice for our family to enjoy hot springs. Not only are the hot springs good, but the hotel's services and facilities are very good. Due to carelessness and set the wrong time, the enthusiastic staff Xiaoqing kindly helped us process the order. Thank you! Every staff member is very enthusiastic and responsible. At dinner, the foreman of the restaurant also asked us whether we were eating well and if there was anything we were dissatisfied with! Boast about the buffet dinner here. The ingredients are very delicious. My husband has taken steak several times, which is also real. The desserts are also very delicate. When checking out, Mr. Zhao also asked us if we were comfortable and gave us a souvenir. Thank you very much! The hotel is committed to improving service. As an old customer of Sanying, we also deeply feel the attitude of the hotel to management and service. Our whole family likes it very much. The hot spring season is here, and we will come next time!

After soaking, I'm tired of my body and mind. The dinner buffet is also very rich...Continuously add dishes, and there are interactive games for children after meals. The children love it, and I want to come again!

msg:I got the room card at two o'clock and entered the room at four o'clock. It took a long time. The bathroom facilities in the room are not new, but the sanitation is good. Walking to the hot spring is relatively close, and there are dozens of large and small hot spring pools, but the swimming pool has fewer recreational facilities, and older children have nothing to play. The waiters in the hotel and spa area are polite and attentive. Overall good. Like the waiter Pan Xuexiang, warm and polite.
