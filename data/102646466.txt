msg:The aparthotel is located in Landis Alley. Looking at Qiandeng Lake from afar, the 35th floor is arranged to have a beautiful view of the entire Qiandeng Lake. There is a convenience store downstairs which is very convenient. Next to Shadian is the Courtyard Hotel. Opposite the hotel is the Marriott Hotel on the upper floor. Nearby are Poly Mall. Aeon, 720-meter Nanhai Wanda Plaza, IPark Garden City, etc.

The hotel was opened last year and is very new and well maintained. It has a grand and home feel, with a modern style and high quality. All appliances including two TVs, washer and dryer, and refrigerator are also Samsung brand. There are kitchen ovens and range hoods all of Siemens brand. There are also tableware, rice cookers, coffee machines, dishes, cooking pans, rice cookers, cutlery and openers, etc. There is no odor in the lobby and kitchen, and strong aromatherapy is no longer used to cover it. Sound effects use Harmon Kardon commonly used in BMW cars. Voice controlled song request is correct.

Thank you for the exquisite fruit plate provided by the hotel🙏. In the evening, go to the GYM room and Sauna. The sauna is huge and beautiful, and there is also a children's playground. Everything is available. The one-bedroom apar**ent in Shadian is clean and hygienic. Oakwood slippers are also very comfortable. The Socket has a USB plug. Use TOTO to clean the toilet. The bedding is comfortable and the pillows are moderately soft and hard. The air conditioner is cold enough and has no smell.

The breakfast is very exciting, including radish and white beef. Very many choices𢳂. It's like having a reserved buffet breakfast. Overall an outstanding performance. All hotel staff are very polite. Worth recommending. Thx.

It is recommended that a simple coffee table and stool sofa can be placed on the balcony. Guests who can book a balcony basically want to sit on the balcony and enjoy it. . .

msg:The hotel hardware is good, big room, big bathroom, big terrace. The location is decent. It takes about 15 minutes to walk to Qiandeng Lake and nearby shopping malls. It's pretty clean. There is a washer and dryer, which is very convenient. Unfortunately, the software failed. When I arrived at the store, no staff took the initiative to contact me and told me that the hotel entrance was a bit difficult to find. Ask for laundry detergent from the washing machine. In the children's playroom, someone needs to be hired to turn on the air conditioning. The above are all minor issues. The biggest problem was that there was a sudden power outage in the middle of the night, and the whole family was woken up by the heat. Later we found out that it was the automatic power-on/off system in the room. Because our family was asleep, it was thought that no one was in the room and automatically turned off the power. There were one or two mosquitoes in the room, which seriously affected sleep.

msg:The hotel has been open for one year, and its hardware facilities are first-class, but its software (personnel services) are in urgent need of improvement. The rooms are spacious, warmly and generally decorated, and the bedding is comfortable. The three-bedroom apar**ent has four bathrooms, two rooms have independent cloakrooms, separate dry and wet laundry rooms, and an independent worker's room. The sound insulation of the north-facing room is not good, you will hear the noise from the road, and there will be a harsh whirring sound when the wind is strong, which will affect your sleep at night.
The few front desk waiters I met were all newcomers with stiff attitudes and did not know how to deal with guests politely. This was far from the first-class hardware facilities. The Ctrip package booked includes round-trip transfers to the town of Florence. However, the hotel is not familiar with the business. The front desk has to temporarily send the guests there through Didi-hailing, and then asks the guests to book a car back to the hotel themselves. It is too unreliable. During the ride-hailing process, there were also situations where the Didi driver could not find the hotel location, refused to pick us up, had a bad attitude, etc., which scared us away and we did not go. It’s better not to launch such a project!

The front desk staff confirmed that all rooms have bathtubs, but when I went to the front desk, they said that my room did not have bathtubs. It was already early in the morning and I felt I was very helpless. In the end, May at the front desk helped to upgrade the room and finally solved the problem. The overall feeling is that the training in the entire hotel is very inadequate because the waiters were very passive during the whole process of having breakfast in the restaurant.

Overall, the hotel service system is rigid, and the staff lacks service plus training or buy-in service spirit.

msg:This was a family trip. The place where we stayed had a beautiful environment, but something ridiculous happened. First of all, when we checked in, we saw a piece of tissue paper stuck to the wall of the bathroom, see the attached picture. Not sure if it has been used or is clean. At the same time, the air conditioner in the living room cannot cool down. Finally, because I didn’t know how to use the Bluetooth speaker in the living room, I asked the hotel staff. The method provided was that it could not be connected to the mobile phone to play music. In the end, I had to check the information online to connect. Although all the problems were solved after reporting, except for the speaker problem, which could only be solved after my own efforts, it shows that the hotel did not do a good job of inspection in advance and was not familiar with the use of hotel facilities, such as speakers, etc., which affected the guest's stay experience. What is a waste is the guest's time. The guest comes out to play, not to help solve the hotel's problems. The hotel's price is not affordable. I hope the hotel can improve it as soon as possible so that the guests can get the service they deserve.

Note: After the above incident, the hotel provided breakfast as compensation. However, I took the initiative to seek compensation from the hotel, not the hotel itself. I hope the hotel can take the initiative to provide services to guests in the future.

It is relatively tidy and clean. However, the customer service staff at the front desk did not arrive at the scheduled check-out time (90 minutes in advance), so they called to inquire, which disturbed people's sleep!

msg:The hotel is very nice and the facilities are OK. It's just a small episode. When I checked in, I said that I needed an extra bed for the next two nights. The front desk staff also knew about it, so they said that the deposit needed to be increased by 1,000 yuan, and I paid it too. When it was time to add an extra bed, they called me at night and said that the extra bed was ready but there was no quilt? No quilt? What is added? There is no quilt for the extra bed fee of 230. I said that if I don’t have it, I will give me a discount. The hotel told me that I am sorry that there is no discount. I was a little angry at that time, and the hotel said that I didn't tell in advance and didn't register. Not registering is their problem at the front desk, why didn't they register when they asked me to pay the deposit. And I have called before booking the hotel to ask if I can add an extra bed, so I said I will book it. I have informed twice in advance that I will have an extra bed. Then I added a quilt. Also, the cleaning aunt left all the rags in the room and didn't take them away, which seemed very unprofessional.

The refrigerator and kitchen utensils are maintained as if they were brand new, and the toilets are also very hygienic. The only thing I can’t comment for now is that it’s too new. The shopping mall below doesn’t have any stores, and even 7-11 hasn’t started renovations. There is only one German restaurant + bar (roasted pork knuckle is delicious) and M Kee. But I believe this is only temporary, so it won't cause me to deduct points.

There are not enough signs at the entrance of Oak, so I went around twice at the beginning, and it turned out to be on the first floor. In addition, I went out to buy a snack in the middle of the night and went to the lobby to scan the parking ticket. There was no one on duty and I couldn’t find the sign when I scanned the QR code. Or you can scan it once like other hotels, and the guest will be free for 24 hours. You can enter at any time, so it's convenient

The family rests without disturbing each other. There is a laundry room, kitchen, and dressing room. The kitchen utensils are complete, but it is a pity that they are not used. The dressing room is separated from the bathroom and the bedroom, so I won't affect my father and I when I get up early. There are also various restaurants below the sixth floor. There are shopping malls such as Wanda in the surrounding area, which can solve all kinds of food and entertainment.

Before checking in, he was clearly told to ask for a room on a lower floor and near the elevator. The staff said that there are no rooms now, and the lowest is the 35th floor.

The hotel's deposit is also based on the mood. The last time it charged 500, this time it will charge 600. And I don't know how to use the credit card machine, so I didn't swipe it after collecting a deposit four or five times! He doesn't know how to use machines, and he looks impatient with us. It's hard to understand where the employees are recruited.

Returning to the front desk, another employee immediately arranged a room on the lower floor next to the elevator. It wasn't there just now, but it was available again when I turned around! Isn't this an employee deliberately targeting what? He also said he had no authority! Ridiculous!

公寓硬件設備非常贊，公寓套房配備三星牌冰箱、洗衣機，烤箱、電飯煲、鍋碗餐具等，非常非常適合家庭或自駕出遊的小夥伴。
最重要的是，衞生情況非常贊！這是我個人住酒店最看重的一點！
強烈推薦！
