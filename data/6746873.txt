msg:This was our first experience at a luxury hotel and our expectations were exceeded! Our driver, 张胜利, was our favorite! His personality and how he says “mei wenti” is a joke we tell even now we’ve moved on to another city. The hotel was modern and artistic with technology surpassing our expectations. The service during breakfast, dinner and in room dining was sooo good and the food was Michelin star.
I am thinking of creating a blog about my experience. I honestly can go on and on but I recommend this hotel 1 thousand times. I will definitely stay again.

msg:Its a common sense that W is the best hotel in Xi’an , the only thing disappointed me is the hair dryer is not Dyson, you must press it continuously to keep it blowing. It used to be an all Dyson hotel. The rest is perfect, if you want a splendid view of Qujiang Lake and the urban atmosphere and that’s it.
这是一个常识，W是西安最好的酒店，唯一让我失望的是吹风机不是戴森的，你必须不断地按压它来保持它的吹风。以前这里全是戴森酒店。如果你想欣赏曲江的壮丽景色和城市的氛围，其他的都是完美的。

msg:Dear Team at Xi&#39;an&#39;s W Hotel,

I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere appreciation for the amazing service and warm hospitality I experienced during my stay at your fantastic hotel. My time at your property has left a lasting impression on me, and I couldn&#39;t have been happier with every aspect of my visit, from the outstanding service and top-notch facilities to the overall atmosphere.

First and foremost, I&#39;d like to give a special shout-out to Ms. Phoebe Gao, whose assistance and care throughout my stay were absolutely exceptional. Not only did she help arrange a wonderful anniversary surprise for my partner before our arrival, but she also went the extra mile by upgrading us to a stunning suite that perfectly suited our preferences and timing. Her thoughtful service truly warmed my heart.

I also want to express my gratitude to Ms.杨玉荣 and the entire team at Xi&#39;an&#39;s W Hotel for their attentive care. From assisting with my travel preparations before coming to Xi&#39;an to ensuring a smooth check-in process, they consistently provided a welcoming and hassle-free experience. They were always ready to lend a hand, answer my questions, and ensure I had a comfortable and enjoyable stay.

Furthermore, I&#39;d like to extend my heartfelt thanks for the birthday cake that was prepared for me. It added a delightful touch to my birthday celebrations.

The hotel&#39;s facilities are truly outstanding, with spacious and impeccably organized guest rooms that offered a comfortable retreat during my stay. While I didn&#39;t have a chance to explore the bar and dining options this time, and there are still some sights in Xi&#39;an that I haven&#39;t had the opportunity to visit, I&#39;m confident that these will be highlights of my next trip. I eagerly look forward to returning to Xi&#39;an&#39;s W Hotel in the near future to continue exploring this beautiful city.

Most importantly, the hotel&#39;s prime location and convenient transportation options made it easy for me to visit the major attractions of Xi&#39;an, including the Ancient City Wall and the Tang Dynasty Night Market. This visit has become a cherished memory, and coming back to such a comfortable haven at the end of the day was a true pleasure.

In conclusion, my overall impression of Xi&#39;an&#39;s W Hotel is extremely positive, and I won&#39;t hesitate to recommend it to my friends and family. Once again, thank you for your warm hospitality and exceptional service. I can&#39;t wait for my next stay at your remarkable establishment.

Wishing your team continued success in providing exceptional experiences for your guests in the days ahead.

Warmest regards,

J

Swimming pool was nice. However, hotel reception staffs did not communicate well in English. There were mosquitoes in the room and I called the reception and asked for mosquito repellents. But the staff didn't understand and I got it only after explaining it in Chinese to the housekeeper who came to my room. And someone kept smoking in the hallway. It's the first time I've stayed at a hotel in such an unpleasant environment.

When checking in, Kitty and Lisa were very enthusiastic and had a good attitude. They upgraded the room for free, with a better view, and gave her a silk eye mask. The most surprising thing was that they simply decorated the room for my mother, gave her a small birthday cake and fruit plate, and a beautiful greeting card. My mother also had an unforgettable birthday (*≧∪≦)🎂The hotel experience was greatヾ(ｏ・ω・)ノThe combination of modern and prosperous Tang Dynasty is full of details.

She answered my questions with enthusiasm and patience, and immediately helped me check the room status and told me that I could check in immediately. After arriving at the hotel, the room service brought me welcome fruit and a beautiful welcome card. Shining used her beautiful handwriting to wish me a pleasant stay on the card and drew a cute little prince and many shining stars. This unexpected warm gesture touched me deeply. During my stay, she not only carefully recommended Xi'an's tourist attractions and night view check-in points to me, but also actively helped coordinate and provide timely feedback when encountering problems in the restaurant, showing her professional and serious work attitude and efficient and positive work efficiency. I sincerely wish Shining a smooth work and happiness every day! 
In addition, I would like to thank Aunt Song Jianhua for preparing a night bed and bubble bath for me, and Aunt Donna for her careful and efficient room cleaning service. These subtle care and thoughtful service left a deep impression on me. 
This stay at W Hotel Xi'an is another unforgettable experience. Come to Chang'an often and don't miss every sunny day. I sincerely wish all the staff of W Hotel Xi'an a smooth work and happy every day, and look forward to seeing you next time!

msg:I have always wanted to experience the prestigious W Hotel. The receptionist I met at check-in, Jessica, was kind-hearted, enthusiastic, thoughtful, patient and courteous. My first impression of the hotel was very good. I booked a Wonderful Lake. The room type with king bed has upgraded floors and views. Even on the day of check-in, it was rainy and still full of experience. The room has a strong visual impact, a very distinctive design, and a very large balcony that is rare in many hotels in Xi'an. , the bathtub seems to be standard, it is very comfortable to enjoy the night view while taking a bath. I forgot to bring my charger when I checked in. The dual C interface of the new 15 cannot be used with Huawei charger. There is no response when I plug it in. I am very grateful to the lady who sent me the charger for her patience in helping me find a suitable charging cable. Finally, she lent me her own charger. I, that's me, Madaha, forgot to ask her name. For dinner, we chose the lobster-themed buffet on the third floor, with unlimited wagyu and baby green dragon, which is worth experiencing. The swimming pool and gym are on the B1 floor with rich equipment. After coming out of the swimming pool, go to the first floor before 00:00 to enjoy the two tipsy cocktails given when you check in. Just report your room number and have a short relaxation. The sofa is very soft and big. It’s suitable for lying down ~ you can go back to your room to take a bath and sleep. I really liked the feeling of not being forced to check out. I also took the initiative to check out at 13:50. I didn't receive a check-out notice before this time, so I didn't have to be disturbed, which was good. Good infrastructure, good design, good maintenance, and the enthusiastic service of all staff gave me a very satisfying stay experience. I couldn't find any flaws and it was great value for money. I would choose to come back if I have the opportunity!

I like history, culture, and architecture, and the facilities and buildings in the hotel are very artistic, especially the acrobatic performance buildings in the hotel lobby. According to the front desk staff, such performances were only held in the Tang Dynasty to receive the most distinguished guests. And Eilish Zhang Siqi, who served me, is very grateful for helping me upgrade my room type, which gave me a very good experience in Xi'an! Thank you.

msg:The hotel is located by the Qujiang River, a cool hotel with a balcony in the guest room. The toilet in the guest room is a bit flashy, the flushing water is not enough, and it is a bit clogged. What needs to be complained is that the breakfast ends at 10 am in the morning, which is unreasonable. The high-end hotels I have stayed in basically end breakfast at 10:30, which needs to be adjusted.

msg:The hotel is on the bank of Qujiang Lake. The balcony of the lake view room you booked can enjoy the scenery. There are restaurants and Hanyao Ruins Park when you go out. It is also nice to take a walk by the lake. The hotel decoration style is dazzling and nightclub-style. Young people may like it, but those who like quiet may feel dizzy😵
The swimming pool is good, but it is only indoors. The outdoor swimming pool is not open (no water, empty, not good)
I didn't notice that breakfast was not included when booking the room. It costs more than 280 yuan per person to order breakfast alone. The room rate of 1,800 yuan in the off-season does not include breakfast, and the mini bar is charged, which feels a bit expensive.

msg:This is the second time I booked W Hotel. A while ago, my home suddenly stopped using water, so I had to choose a hotel near my home. Because I am a local, I actually have a prejudice against W Hotel. One is because everyone says it is a "net celebrity hotel", and the other is because it is too noisy, and I always feel that I may not be able to handle it. But after staying there once, I will always recommend it to my friends. The service provided by the front desk lady Kitty is very good, considerate, and enthusiastic. It can even be said that W makes me feel at home, and the troubles of water outage are swept away.
This time I entertained friends who have not seen each other for many years. I decisively chose the lake view king room of W Hotel. I contacted Miss Kitty as soon as possible. She apologized to tell me that there were no king rooms because a team was staying there, so I had to squat on the website. As a result, I squatted for a long time and finally saw the last king room. Hard work pays off!
I thought the last room might not have such a good view, but! But! My friend said that I was lucky enough to help them upgrade to a suite with a small living room and an invincible view! !
Thank you Kitty for your quick reply and arranging the room! Thank you W Hotel for taking care of me! ❤️

Service is written down in Xi'an's bones, and it goes without saying here. From the moment you get off the bus, someone will take care of your luggage. You will not make mistakes with the number, and it will be sent directly to your room after you have completed the formalities. Because I arrived early and the room was not ready yet, the manager on duty helped make arrangements quickly during check-in and also upgraded the room. When you make a call in the room, you will immediately say "Ms. xx" kindly after the call is connected, and it will be delivered immediately without you having to report your room number. Meticulous management is reflected in every aspect. The experience was very good. The facilities are also very good, there are all kinds of technological activities, and there are many hotel activities. This is also the largest W Hotel in Asia. I will stay here again next time I come to Xi'an.

It's very spacious. Each room also has a big sofa that you can lie down on. It's very hygienic.
The washbasin and dressing table are also super large, and the toilet room and luggage room are also very large.
On the other side, there is a small balcony outside. The wine cabinet looks great, but
Most of them charge a fee, the capsule coffee is good, and the fried noodles for breakfast are worth it
recommend! The hotel is located 5 kilometers away from the Big Wild Goose Pagoda and 5 kilometers away from the Bell Tower.
The Drum Tower is about 10 kilometers away, so traveling is quite convenient.

It was so romantic, I had balloons🎈 and a customized cake as a gift, it was so thoughtful. The lady at the front desk was also very patient. By mistake, we were not redeemed for breakfast when we made the reservation. During the communication, Miss Wang Xin learned that we really wanted to try the hotel breakfast, so she specially helped us apply for it. It was very, very good. Thank you, she was on vacation the next day, but when I sent a message, she still responded to all my questions seriously, so I must give her a good review. Everyone here is smiling and very friendly. Truly a home away from home service. If Xi'an's food and culture make you linger, then I can say that the service of all the staff at W Hotel will also make you miss this city. I hope I will have the opportunity to come here again in the future, just because there is such a good hotel here🥰🥰🥰

When we arrived at the hotel, we met the super nice front desk manager Zhuzhu. She was kind and kind. Knowing that we had two rooms, one big and one small, he thoughtfully arranged a room for us. Twin beds, upgraded to a king bed with stunning lake view. I experienced two different room types at once. The hotel room is large and spacious, and the decoration is very modern. Lovely golden peach elements can be seen everywhere in the room. I have to mention here that the stunning lake view is really beautiful. When the lights turn on in the evening, you can see the Big Wild Goose Pagoda in the distance and the beautiful Qujiang River. There is also a thoughtfully designed bathtub facing the lake view for you to take a bath in. . The hotel itself is also a beautiful landscape, combining the prosperous Tang Dynasty with modern high-tech elements, giving people a feeling of traveling through ancient and modern times. The hotel breakfast must also be praised. The variety of eggs is very rich, and there are also separate small bowls of hot spring eggs. Not to mention Xi'an special snacks such as whistle noodles, mutton soup, and roujiamo, which can also be tasted at the hotel during breakfast time without leaving home. It can be said that half of the happiness on this trip to Xi'an was given by w!

The hotel's sense of modernity and design begins from the moment you drive into the basement. The moment the elevator door opened from the basement to the lobby, I felt as if I was in Las Vegas.

At night, the lobby is even more beautiful with lights and music.

From the terrace of the lake view room, you can overlook the entire Qujiangchi Heritage Park. While taking a bath, you can also see the water "faucet" spraying water by the park pool, which makes you feel extremely relaxed.

The hotel's swimming pool facilities are complete and the water temperature is suitable. The surf pool, steam room and steam room are very spacious and the temperature is sufficient.

Coinciding with the Spring Festival, the hotel also specially prepared Spring Festival couplets, paper-cutting on-site writing and making activities, filling the festive a**osphere. The lobby is decorated with a photo background, and portrait lighting is specially set up at night. The details are in place.

The hotel's breakfast is particularly rich in variety, from Xi'an to Sicily, from fresh biangbiang noodles to eggs Benedict, all kinds of local and international dishes are available.

Before I leave, I have already decided that I will definitely come back if I go to Xi'an again!

msg:I am very happy to stay at W Hotel. It is said that this hotel is the largest in Asia. Since it is the largest in Asia, I must take my children to stay there. First of all, the hotel is in a good location. It is very convenient to eat around and is also very close to Haidilao. Entering the lobby, you will see a huge chandelier that is very eye-catching. It is said to be inspired by ancient silk. The white crystal chandelier hovers lightly. At night, there will be pink and blue lights that change, turning the lobby into a technological one. And fashionable. The sculptures of ladies from the Tang Dynasty at the elevator add a touch of national style to the hotel, making everyone feel like they are in Xi'an. The check-in process was very smooth. I would like to praise the lovely Anne. We had communicated on the phone before. In order to allow us to check in early, she quickly arranged sanitation and cleaning, upgraded the lake view room for free, and sent cocktails and welcome fruits. Thank you for meeting us. The style of the hotel. Some friends online commented that it is nightclub style. I think it is more appropriate to call it a bar, technology culture. Some multimedia technology, plus some art, make people feel comfortable with the integration. Entering the room, the overall lighting in the room is very good. The blue-green background wall and a copy of "The Golden Peach of Samarkand" (a masterpiece of Western Sinology) in each room make the room quiet, mysterious and advanced. I don't know. If you turn a few pages before going to bed, will you dream back to the prosperous Chang'an? What the child saw at first glance was the large balcony. He happily opened the glass door and saw Qujiang Park. There was a large bathtub facing the balcony, which is also special for children. If you like it, the hotel will give you a free bath bag. W's bedding is very comfortable, and the shower gel and skin care lotion are pretty good. After all, at this level, it still has requirements for itself. The swimming pool was renovated yesterday and just started to be used. The water is clear and not too cold. There are no swimming goggles and there is no sales promotion for us to buy them. Instead, the hotel guy lent us the swimming goggles. The children like these hardware and services very much and strongly request to use them. W stayed for one more night and successfully persuaded me to turn down another hotel of the same level. When I checked in to renew my stay, another beautiful woman gave me two silk eye masks as a souvenir. She was very embarrassed to say that they were only pink. I was worried that my son wouldn’t like them. Seeing that my phone’s battery was low, she thoughtfully asked me if I wanted to charge it. So W's service is really great, giving you surprises and warmth in every place you think of and unexpectedly. In short, W Hotel is highly recommended. When you come here, you will unconsciously want to explore more places worth visiting here. Come and experience it when you have time, you will be surprised!

The rooms are spacious and the balcony can also see the beautiful scenery across the street. I am happy😁The children have had a good rest these days👌🏻The young brothers and sisters in the store are also very polite, thumbs up👍🏻 It happened to be my birthday when I took my children out to play, and the hotel prepared a little surprise! Thank you to W Hotel Xi'an for the careful arrangements. I am very satisfied! Must praise!

The hotel has all kinds of supporting facilities and the staff's service attitude is great! Anyway, I can’t fault anything. Next time I take my kids to Xi’an, I’ll stay at the W Hotel

You can enjoy the beautiful view of Qujiang Pool from the house. The buffet is rich in variety, there are a lot of seafood, and the oysters are very plump. The lady at the front desk, Eilish, received her warmly and specially added WeChat. If you need anything, she can send you a message as soon as possible. It’s delicious. I brought several bags of green tea. The hotel is fashionable and very attractive. I look forward to my next stay.

After making a reservation, we told the hotel about our stay preferences in advance. Knowing that we were on a honeymoon trip, the hotel sent me a honeymoon cake, which was great! When checking in, Anna added my WeChat account to connect with me. After checking into the room, my luggage was brought up after a while, and Anna also sent a very considerate greeting. The room has a large balcony with a view of Hanyao and Nanhu. I can vaguely see that the bed in the Big Wild Goose Pagoda room is a bit soft for me. It’s not very comfortable to sleep in. Everything else is pretty good. There is no subway nearby, but it’s very convenient to take a taxi. The breakfast is also quite rich in wontons and pasta. It’s worth recommending!

I made a temporary decision to stay at the W Hotel all together. I communicated with Miss Phoebe, the Guest Relations Director, in advance, and finally booked an extra two nights. I stayed in a twin suite with lake view for the last night. The room was very good and the service was very good. On the last night, I stayed in the Fengyun Suite. The view was unparalleled. They also thoughtfully added an extra bed. Free drinks, food, and red wine in the mini bar, especially Philippines. Miss Phoebe, she has a nice voice, warm and thoughtful service, very careful, like it manually, thank you Miss Phoebe😙I will stay at W Hotel again when I go to Xi'an

When you enter the lobby and elevator at night, you feel like you can have fun anytime and anywhere. It's my first time staying at W. The lady at the front desk is very considerate. After being upgraded, there is a dedicated housekeeper you can contact directly. The sanitary facilities are of high standard. Except for the smell of shower gel and shampoo, which is not what I like, there is no round mirror for makeup. Each room has a large balcony where you can lean on the railing and enjoy the view. As soon as I used the wash basin, I found it was clogged, and maintenance responded quickly to fix it. The hotel even sent me a piece of fruit. The breakfast is very rich and meets the standards of a star hotel. The service staff will take you to your seat as soon as you enter.

msg:Stayed at W Hotel on New Year's Eve. In terms of hotel design style, it is very fashionable and grand, and it does incorporate the nightclub style. At the same time, the hotel also explored many Xi'an elements and incorporated them into the design, and the small details are quite well done. The colors are also very bold, using a lot of high-saturation colors, which are super tense, and the whole thing is very, very distinctive.
The location of the hotel can be said to be valuable. It is on the south side of Qujiang Lake, close to the Tang Dynasty Evernight City and the Big Wild Goose Pagoda. Dining around the hotel is also very convenient and excellent.
The check-in experience is still very good. All staff have high professionalism, including cleaning. Since it was New Year's Eve, there were many guests going through the formalities, and there were dedicated people to maintain order and help queue up to go through the formalities. The person who checked me in was Ms. Phoebe. Although she was wearing a mask, I could still feel her warm and enthusiastic smile. She introduced me to the hotel's facilities, meal times, etc. in detail, and quickly completed the check-in procedure, which was very nice. When I left, a girl named Xu Chenxi handled the formalities for me. She was also very professional and asked about my experience during the stay. So I say this hotel is not only good-looking, but most importantly, has very high professionalism.
You can order takeout at the hotel and the robot will deliver it to your room. There is a turndown service at night, which is very considerate. What’s particularly good is that when you call the front desk, they’ll pick up the phone as soon as it rings. There’s really nothing to say about this service.
I tried both the hotel's dinner and breakfast. It was at the level of a five-star hotel, with both Chinese and Western food. Breakfast included Shaanxi specialties such as Roujiamo and Hu spicy soup. There were a lot of fruits. There were hairy crabs for dinner. Similarly, the service is very good. Even if it is very busy on New Year's Eve, I can suddenly clear the table and change the tableware for the guests in time.
Finally, let me talk about the room. I am very satisfied and like it very much. The acoustics in the living room are very good, there are many movies to choose from, and children can watch cartoons. The king bed is huge, no problem for a family of three. The bathroom is really nice, and it's great for taking photos. The balcony is also a special feature. It is very long and can directly overlook the South Lake.

It is very convenient to take the bus back to Datang Evernight City. The hotel itself is quite good, with a sense of design and a nice view. The most satisfying thing is the housekeeper, Ms. Eilish Siqi. She basically acts as a special forces soldier on the first day of check-in, and only has time to spend time in the hotel on the second day. The young lady that I can think of has arranged everything for me! Perfect experience!

msg:It is my habit to relax on personal vacations while also taking care of professional inspections. So during the National Day, through the Ctrip platform, I specially booked three top hotels in Xi'an: Sofitel Legend, Canopy by Hilton, and W hotel, not only to experience different styles, but also to "find faults" and have a professional pk.
      Let me briefly introduce my initial feelings about W (the professional report will not be posted here):
1. Hardware 4.9 stars:
~~~Deduct 0.1 points to avoid being too proud.
1) Lifestye is filled with charm, avant-garde, vitality, fashion and luxury both inside and outside W! If you are an urban upstart who pursues fashion and quality, W must be your best choice.
2) The nightclub style in the lobby is really stunning. The whirlwind-like silk-shaped chandeliers with changing colors are very, very eye-catching! The space in the lobby is slightly disordered, which makes the flow of guests' check-in less obvious (according to reviews, more than one guest couldn't find his way around). Of course, if you are not in a hurry to lie down in the guest room, but are busy clocking in like me, then you will definitely be willing to indulge in the exciting music rhythm in the lobby and be happy to find it.
3) The decoration of the guest rooms and public areas uses exquisite materials and fine workmanship. The material and color matching and detail processing are so perfect that people have no time to praise them.
4) The fitness center is comparable to a professional gym, with complete facilities and really big!
2. Service 4.9 stars:
~~~0.1 points are deducted because the experience of check-in in the lobby and breakfast are not very good.
1) Thanks to Tian Xinyue for actively communicating and even taking up personal rest time to actively coordinate and meet the guests' visit requirements.
2) Thank you Yang Yurong for providing warm and detailed service to guests.
3) During the check-in period in the lobby, the reception staff failed to cooperate with the guest's request for a visit after asking the superior next to him. He just pretended to have a full room, which showed a lack of honesty. In fact, every guest who actively requests to visit other guest rooms may be a potential repeat customer for upgrade or even a volunteer promoter. Of course, he may also be a "professional negative reviewer". It is very unprofessional for the front desk to not pay attention to the guests' visit requirements.
4) The breakfast buffet is rich in variety and the space is large enough. However, the number of seats is slightly insufficient compared to the passenger flow. The breakfast that ends at 10 o'clock actually has to queue up at 9 o'clock to enter. It is a pity that it cannot meet the peak dining needs.
     As a planning consultant and design expert in the tourism industry, I am always striving to create better life experiences and product spaces. This has many common themes with W’s Welcome+Whatever+Whenever. No hotel brand has its own loyal fans like W. I believe I will also become a new fan of W.

When I extended my stay, the young man I met at the front desk, Sima, was handsome, very patient, and his service was very good. I ordered him 👍.
When entering the door, the hotel doorman was quite polite and said welcome to W Hotel Xi'an. The details are a plus.
If I have another chance to come to Xi'an, I will definitely choose W.

There is a large indoor swimming pool and gym on the lower floor, and the hotel has rich facilities. It is worth mentioning that the staff are very hospitable and courteous, both in the lobby and the customer service lady Shining. She provided patient service to retrieve our leftover clothes and the service was in place.

msg:I personally have very high requirements for accommodation. Whether on business or tourism, I think good service and environment are crucial. What surprised me was that the hotel upgraded me to a stunning lake view room for free. The view is simply amazing. Great, the staff Lisa also helped me apply to the manager for a free breakfast for two people for a day. I have my own dedicated staff member Eilish. You can contact her 24 hours a day. As long as you need it, she not only gave me welcome fruit but also helped me delay the stay. Check out until 2pm! The hotel staff are really attentive and considerate! 💗My experience at W Hotel this time was great. If I have the opportunity to come to Xi'an again, I will choose it as always!

msg:This time I went to Xi'an to have the best impression and experience of the hotel🏨
The W Hotel, the largest in Asia, is indeed very good👍The high-end a**osphere and class are well deserved!
Room type: Wonderful Twin Suite
Facilities: Very complete, also equipped with facial cleanser. At first I read the reviews that this wonderful twin suite had poor value for money, but after staying here I felt it was the best value for money. The room is spacious, well laid out, and comes with all the free food and drinks.
Breakfast: Special mention should be made. The layout is very thoughtful. No matter where you sit, there is a buffet bar. It is very considerate and is also a shortcoming of many other hotels. The breakfast is rich in content, especially the specialties are clearly marked, and the experience is very good.
Environment: It is a bit far from the city, but the environment is very good. Although the room has a city view, part of it can see Qujiang Pool, and the rest is the front of the hotel. It is very quiet especially at night when the lights are on.
Service: On-call, quick response, service staff proactively come forward to inquire and assist when checking in or out.
Health: The hotel is newly renovated and newly renovated.
If I have to make suggestions, let me nitpick: 1. It’s a surprise to have facial cleanser next to the sink, so I’d also like to have one in the bathroom to make it more convenient when taking a shower.
2. You can install a trash can in the living room, or move the trash can from the bedroom to the living room for higher usage.
All in all, my experience at W Hotel was very good, and it added a lot of color to the somewhat boring trip to Xi'an!

msg:This time I came to Xi'an and chose to stay at the W Hotel in Xi'an. I heard it is the best hotel in Xi'an and the experience was quite good. When we checked in, we met Eilish from guest relations. She introduced the hotel to us carefully. She responded promptly and provided solutions if we needed anything. When we checked out, she thoughtfully prepared a small gift for us. She was so considerate! The hotel is also very close to the scenic spot, making travel very convenient. The design of the hotel is also very good, trendy and fashionable, and the breakfast is also very good!
The only drawback is that the service at the bar at night was not very good. I sat and waited for a long time before my order was delivered. I asked for a menu later but was not given one. I guess I forgot or was too busy. However, the distinguished guests at the front desk did provide very good service, were enthusiastic and professional, so I still have to give it a five-star rating. I will choose this hotel next time I return to Xi'an.

msg:First of all, ABConcept's design is full of futuristic magic, and it perfectly integrates location, facilities and services to provide a first-class hotel experience.

This hotel has an excellent location, making it easy to reach both the business district and major attractions. I especially appreciate the convenience of the transportation hub around the hotel, which is very important for exploring the city and planning your itinerary.

And the hotel facilities amazed me. The spacious and comfortable guest rooms make you feel at home. The advanced gym equipment and clear and bright swimming pool perfectly meet my leisure needs.

But what impressed me most was the hotel’s attentive service. From check-in to departure, the hotel staff always treated us with a professional and friendly attitude. They responded quickly to our needs and provided an excellent room service and dining experience. Every employee gave us warm and thoughtful care, making us truly feel at home.

In addition, the sanitary conditions of the hotel are also worth mentioning. The rooms are neat and tidy and the public areas are always kept to a high standard. This creates a comfortable and secure living environment for us.

Finally, for this experience, I think the price of the hotel is very reasonable compared to the services and facilities provided. I felt that the price paid was worth the money and it was an enjoyable experience that exceeded my expectations.

All in all, this hotel won me over with its great location, great facilities and excellent service. If you are looking for a hotel that has the perfect combination of location, facilities and service, I would highly recommend this hotel. I believe it will bring you an unforgettable travel experience.

msg:W Xi'an is a hotel I have always wanted to try, so I decided to take advantage of this business trip to Xi'an. Although it was only a short night, it was still quite amazing. The nightclub style in the lobby is quite shocking, but once you get to the room, it is another urban literary and leisure style. My favorite is the hidden tea station, which is very surprising. The last time I saw it was in Singapore. In my opinion, apart from the excellent hardware, the most valuable thing about W in Xi'an is that the hotel staff are young, energetic and very friendly. Susan at the bar, a male manager, and Phoebe at the front desk were all very professional and friendly. They made me feel very happy during this short trip. I look forward to coming back next time and will recommend it to my friends and family.

msg:Before every trip, what my husband and I care most about is the choice of hotel at each destination, because a good living experience will make every trip more comfortable and enjoyable. After looking around, I felt that the three best hotels in Xi'an were the W Hotel Xi'an, the Ritz-Carlton Hotel and the Hilton Canopy Hotel, and I was torn between these three. After reading a lot of reviews, I felt that W Hotel was the best overall, so I wanted to book a W Hotel for two nights first, and then try another one if I didn't feel good. However, as soon as I checked in, I didn't want to leave. I booked another night directly and stayed at W Hotel for the entire trip to Xi'an. Because I really don’t want to leave, hahaha, I can’t experience other hotels in Xi’an. It’s really, really great! This experience was even better than the W I stayed in Guangzhou at that time!
When making the reservation, I saw that Ctrip had given us the privilege of upgrading the room type. I didn’t understand it at first, so I called the hotel front desk for consultation. Yuky, the customer service girl at the front desk, explained it to me very patiently. Shamelessly, I asked for WeChat and asked her to introduce us to local food and travel routes. The beautiful lady Yuky is kind-hearted and explained to us very patiently. She also reserved the high-floor room we wanted in advance. This time we stayed in a stunning lake-view king bed room. The view was really great. Great. Looking out the window at night, I feel like the prosperous city of Chang'an is right at my feet.
There is also the hotel's concierge. The service is really considerate. Every time I get on Didi or Didi, someone will open the door, help with luggage, and give you a warm message wishing you a safe trip and a happy trip.
I had breakfast at the hotel for two days during my stay. It was really luxurious and rich in variety. I didn’t believe it after reading other users’ reviews at first, but after actually eating it, the picky Shunde people also felt that it was very good. Great.
Xi'an W Hotel is impeccable in terms of facilities, services, and dining experience. The check-in experience is great, and my picky husband can't find fault with it. When we were leaving, Miss Yuky specially sent us a WeChat message to tell us that we had a safe journey. If there is anything delicious we want to eat in Xi’an, we can ask her to help us mail it. It’s so warm! ! !
If you come to Xi'an in the future, you will definitely stay here again. See U next time.

The rooms are spacious and bright, the bathroom is oversized, each area is clearly divided, the breakfast variety is also very rich, and the local snacks in Xi'an are well prepared. In particular, the hotel housekeeper Lucy has a strong sense of service. She called us in advance to inquire about our check-in time and needs, upgraded our room and prepared welcome fruits. It really made us feel at home. I will definitely stay again when I come to Xi'an in the future. Will recommend to friends😀😀😀👍👍👍

The handsome guy greeting you at the door is very down-to-earth in his clothes. If it weren't for the walkie-talkie on his wrist, , I thought the handsome guy was interested in me, an old aunt🤔️, because I went there at night. The lights at the entrance and lobby were so beautiful. The little girl who received me also had a smile. The room was big and romantic, and the ruins park was outside the window. It was so beautiful. The steamed noodles for breakfast are so delicious and the food is so rich. All in all, it’s worth a stay!

msg:As a landmark building in Xi'an and an online celebrity check-in attraction, I personally feel that Xi'an Hotel is also a ceiling-level existence. We live not too far from the hotel, and you can see the big "W" logo of the hotel through the balcony at night😊 I promised my children to hold a family birthday party here a few years ago, but due to the sudden COVID-19 epidemic, it has never been possible. Finally, this year is possible, and the child's birthday coincides with the weekend, so it's a wish! Nice!

Facilities: The hotel has complete facilities, including restaurants, bars, swimming, fitness and hairdressing, suitable for all types of people. The children spent most of the afternoon in the swimming pool the next afternoon after staying, and they were stunned and didn’t want to come out (˵¯͒〰¯͒˵) Breakfast has a complete range of categories and is great value! The room is large in size, with a large independent balcony, complete facilities, high-end, 2.2-meter large bed, sofa coffee table, toiletries, sanitary ware, tea, clothes hangers, etc. It is very convenient to use, especially the smart toilet, which is convenient to use and clean and hygienic!
Hygiene: The towels are white, the tableware is shiny, and the sanitary ware is clean without water stains. I still believe in the hygiene standards of star hotels.
Environment: The wonderful lake view room we booked is adjacent to the 5A-level scenic spot Qujiang Nanhu Park. The sound insulation effect of the room is really good. Once the door is closed, it is not noisy at all. It can be said to be quiet in the bustle! You can overlook the whole park from the balcony. From the railing, you can vividly remember the scenes of taking your children for a walk in the park and boating in the lake in the past. Looking at the big red characters of "Qujiang Hanyao Ruins Park", you can feel the ancient and modern culture, history and modernity. The integration of the people, I feel that the Wanzhong Group is really discerning and particular, and the location of the hotel is really good!
Service: The hotel service is something I would particularly like to praise. The reception at the front desk is warm and thoughtful, and there are staff members who guide guests upstairs in the elevator of the underground garage. When we checked in, the receptionist Wang Zhen was amiable, beautiful and kind. When she heard that we were going to have a birthday party for our children, she took the initiative to give us a breakfast and hotel customization. Birthday cake 🎂. Donna and Zhang Panpan from the guest room styling depar**ent carefully decorated and styled the room. When checking out, the front desk lady Zhang Siqi served enthusiastically and carefully collected opinions and suggestions. I want to say that the hotel culture is online, the management is in place, the service is perfect, it is so considerate, it is awesome👍🏻

All in all, a perfect and pleasant weekend trip, a birthday surprise for a child, and an unforgettable late rendezvous! Thank you W Hotel and look forward to seeing you again in the near future 😁

The big bed room facing Qujiang Pond is the most stunning, with a wide view, overlooking the Big Wild Goose Pagoda. It is very comfortable to open the curtains every morning. On the first day, due to a problem with the room facilities, James, the duty manager, worked hard for us to make up for the unsatisfactory experience. Changed the room for us, tried our best to satisfy the guests, and let us spend four nights satisfactorily. From the lobby to the guest rooms, the hotel is full of modern art. There are installations and modern art paintings in every corner, and we took a lot of photos. The room attendants are very enthusiastic, and the various needs of the guests are met to the greatest extent. The breakfast is rich, and the lady who leads the table will introduce each meal carefully. In short, this is a hotel worth experiencing in Xi'an.

Environment: The view from the room on the 20th floor is very good (thanks to Owen for helping us upgrade the room). There is a lake downstairs with a beautiful view, and the lights are also very beautiful at night

Breakfast: There are many types. I ate the first bowl of noodles and Roujiamo at the W Hotel in Xi'an for three days. My friends all said that the taste was good, and they liked it👍Steamed pork ribs, steamed chicken feet, steamed pumpkin, steamed corn...very tasty

Transportation: It takes 15-20 minutes to ride to Datang Everbright City and Furong Garden (from Everbright City to get back to the hotel, you can’t get Didi and plan to take three trips back, but it costs 50 yuan to get up, so we turned our heads and left. Measure the riding distance for friends who will encounter this problem next time, more than 3 kilometers, 15 minutes)

Service: The luxurious five-star service is still very worthy of praise (five-star reviews, very satisfied with the first-line service partners)

Although there are many early breakfasts in the hotel, they are not very rich and delicious. Good-looking is better than good Eat, it’s not as good as earlier, I hope to strengthen the detailed service. After all, the price in summer is so high, and the service needs to keep up with the crowds. There is a Gemdale Plaza next to it, which is also convenient for temporary shopping and toy shopping. It is a hotel suitable for punching in and taking pictures. Afternoon tea is still very good beautiful

I am a hotel lover, it can be said that more than half of the purpose of travel is to stay in a hotel😂
1. Let me talk about the hardware first, it is absolutely OK. Basically, the top brands in the professional field are used, such as Hansgrohe faucet, Kohler basin for adults, Villeroy & Boch for children, and even the door locks are from GEZE. . The rooms are spacious and modern. Btw, compared with the hardware, the hotel's toiletries are relatively ordinary.

msg:This time, the w hotel was booked five days before the trip, and the price in the early 2000s was acceptable during the peak season. Although this trip is not a hotel, it is just an accommodation for leaving early and returning late. But it turns out that even if it is not a hotel, it is worth staying in the largest W Hotel in Asia. It makes me feel the real service here. Very enthusiastic. There are 2 small episodes: two breakfasts per day for two days of stay, but there are 2 children. It was originally planned to negotiate and merge it for one day, but the front desk said no, but you can ask and call me back, but I didn’t reply after dinner, so I asked again, maybe the boy who helped us check in was no longer there. The person who received me may be an old employee or the person in charge directly presented breakfast for 2 days and 2 children, which is absolutely magnificent. The breakfast is particularly rich, with all the delicacies of Shaanxi. Speaking of the room, which is more than 60 square meters, it is very large, and the curtains and toilets are all smart. The children are very happy. But I accidentally stained the sheets and mattresses at night. I thought we might need compensation, but the room service was enthusiastic enough to help us clean and change them for free, and recommended us to play itineraries. Knowing that we will go to Dunhuang later, he also gave us some children's toiletries. Our own travel sheets were also washed and sent to the room.
When we got back in the evening, it was already folded and handwritten.
This time, I am very satisfied with my stay at the W Hotel in Xi'an, the largest in Asia. Thanks to the handsome boy at the front desk for the breakfast given to the child. Thanks to Zhang Panpan and Ji Xiaoyan from the room service depar**ent for their warm service. If there is a chance to come to Xi'an in the future, I will definitely stay at the w hotel again.

Fortunately, I got a room upgrade, upgraded to a large suite + 270-degree viewing balcony with no dead ends, it's amazing! The Kiki beauty at the front desk is warm and considerate, making people feel at home. The design of the hotel is avant-garde and modern, with perfect details, and the view from the large balcony is invincible. It is also very pleasant to take a walk in the park near the hotel after dinner, which is much better than going to the popular attractions in Xi'an. In addition, the hotel has a rich breakfast, all kinds of gym equipment, and indoor and outdoor swimming pools. Children like it very much. Adults and children don't want to go out in the hotel at all! In the future, if I have the opportunity to stay here for a few more days~

The original intention was because W ranked first in Xi'an Travel Hotel, and the day of check-in was amazing by the beautiful lobby. Ms. Jessica's caring service + nice, 👍 one! The hotel breakfast basically covers all kinds of check-in delicacies in Xi'an. Even with a high occupancy rate, every guest can still be given a seat. The balcony of the room overlooks the Qujiang River, with frequent beautiful photos, suitable for selfie lovers. The room furnishings, appliances, elevators, and swimming pool are all eye-catching. It is worth mentioning that the doorman wears casual pants with a T-shirt in the main color of the hotel. It looks very comfortable. The hotel staff said that they hope that both guests and staff can be comfortable and happy in the hotel. This kind of humanistic concept is worthy of praise in the service industry🌹 ! Finally, I would like to pay tribute to my great choice🫡!

On the day of check-in, the staff Zhuzhu was very enthusiastic. Seeing that we were staying as a family, we upgraded the suite for free. However, because the remaining suites were on a lower floor, we still chose a lake-view room on a higher floor. Zhuzhu also thoughtfully presented a small gift , thank you very much! The location of the hotel's breakfast is always in an orderly manner. I didn't expect the hotel's biangbiang noodles, roujiamo, and lamb soup to be so authentic. Wow! In addition, the environment of the hotel swimming pool is very good, the water is also very good, and the safety measures are sufficient. It is very suitable for parents and children to play on rainy days. One day I went out to play and drank a few more cups of tea. The next day, the room staff saw this detail. They not only replenished a lot of black tea, but also wrote a small card. When I finally left the store, the staff Han Miao enthusiastically communicated with each other. , and prepared small gifts for the children, it can be seen that the overall service level of W Hotel is very high! Next time I come to Xi'an, I will stay at the W Hotel

I stayed in the Fengyun Suite, and the room impressed me very much. The view of the lake from the room is spectacular, and the lake view I wake up to every morning gives me a sense of peace and relaxation. Secondly, the space of the suite is very large, with 130+ square meters, which makes me feel very comfortable. I especially like the large balcony in the room, where I can enjoy the beautiful scenery, which is very comfortable.

In addition, the public areas of the W Hotel Xi'an are equally amazing. The sense of design here is eye-catching. Whether it is the lobby or the restaurant, every corner shows a unique style and careful arrangement.

I would also like to give special thanks to Ms. Shining at the W Xi'an. She was in touch with me prior to my stay and was very attentive to my needs. Her professionalism and friendliness made me feel welcome and made the whole stay more perfect.

Overall, I am very satisfied with my stay at W Xi'an. The great location, the amazing room and view, and the attentive service all make it an unforgettable trip.

msg:The overall experience of this trip to Xi'an was very good. I chose this hotel because of the brand name. I have quite high requirements for the hotel when traveling with children. Objective evaluation: The decoration style of the hotel is dark, cool and avant-garde. This is a different style from the luxury hotels I have stayed in before. After getting off the bus, the concierge staff are very active and quick to provide service, which is very good and has sufficient manpower. The personal image and appearance of the reception staff at the front desk are quite good, but they are not enthusiastic enough and a little cold. (I’m just comparing with hotels of the same level I’ve stayed in in the past.) The facilities and environment in the guest rooms are basically in line with expectations. What’s good is that the layout of the bathroom is convenient for daily makeup, which is something that many hotels lack. The toilet is a bit noisy, the tap water heats up slowly, and the hair dryer is not easy to use (a common problem in hotels)
It is worth mentioning that there was a small problem in the guest room, so I called the main station. The girl operator was very kind and quickly contacted the director. I am very satisfied with the director's communication attitude and processing efficiency. The communication is pleasant, and the communication ability and emotional intelligence are in line with the grade of the hotel. Like it👍
The basic types of breakfast are complete and meet the needs, and the collection is a bit fast. Generally, the hotel will extend the time depending on the situation of the guests.
I want to come to Xi'an again, I missed the Shaanxi History Museum, the journey is very happy!

Special commendation to Daniel Lee from the concierge, who is my Chief Concierge!
After the room was booked in early April, I kept asking about my itinerary and plans intermittently, helping me book cars and tickets, and note the room type and special requirements. The greetings after arrival were so heart-warming! He is my Doraemon in Xi'an! All kinds of recommendations and pitfalls saved me a lot of time!
All the requirements within a reasonable range are met, making it more convenient and comfortable for me to travel with my children. On the 30th, we took our children to go to the Terracotta Army early in the morning, so we didn’t have time for breakfast, so he prepared four bags of snacks, drinks, fruit coffee for us to eat on the way. Knowing that our tickets are late in the afternoon, they helped us apply for a late check-out as late as possible... …
This kind of service is second * various hotels of the same level in the south! ! !
And then there is the uncle chef, his craftsmanship is really amazing!
Looking around, it turned out that the most delicious Roujiamo and oil-splashed noodles are in the hotel's breakfast!
The uncle chef is super particular!

Showing off three bowls is not a problem!

msg:#Xi'an W Hotel
After the epidemic, I took my family out for a trip for the first time. I chose Xi’an, the ancient capital of thousands of years. I browsed several hotels on Ctrip, and finally chose W among the Westin and W Hotel, because I also wanted to experience the style of Xi’an after staying at the W Hotel in Shanghai. , It is said to be W Asia flagship store 📍Because I arrived at the hotel at night, I was shocked by the psychedelic phantom in front of me when I first entered the hotel lobby. You can feel the magnificent imagination of the prosperous Tang Dynasty and the avant-garde modern design concept melt into a feast here👍
The main thing is the tide, the nightclub style is really amazing when the lobby lights up at night
It’s very beautiful when you take a picture 😎
This time I booked two stunning lake-view king-bed rooms, each of which is equipped with a super-large viewing balcony, with city views on one side and lake views on the other. There is a VIP viewing platform on the roof of the hotel. An experience 🥳

#Caring service
When it comes to service, W Hotel is really considerate, because it is the first time I came to Xi’an and I am a free traveler, I don’t know the itinerary very well, so I called the lobby in advance and asked the hotel staff to recommend Li Peixiang from the concierge depar**ent. He introduced the itinerary very carefully and helped Recommend interesting places to buy tickets for attractions, and help plan a few days of travel itinerary 👍 Even if it is 12 o'clock in the middle of the night to ask about the attractions, it will be answered in almost seconds. It is really hard 🙏 Let me have a great experience in Xi'an for the first time. Xi'an The people are so warm... I would also like to praise Zhang Qiao, our floor housekeeper, for being very hospitable and welcoming. The room is very clean and tidy. One night, I accidentally scalded my hand with hot water. I called the service desk and immediately delivered two bags of ice cubes. Caring is really a very good trip, next time I come to Xi'an, I will still choose to stay at W Hotel🏨👍👏

msg:When you come to Xi’an to travel, choose W Hotel. From the moment you get off the bus, all the staff will accompany you to check in and help deliver your luggage to the room. Kiki at the front desk patiently introduced the facilities in the room and prepared the fruit, which is very nice. The room is large and the layout is more user-friendly. The only disadvantage is that it is next to the outdoor unit. Fortunately, the room is well insulated and no noise can be heard. Sitting on the balcony at night, you can see the night view of Qujiang Lake, which is very good. The hotel's breakfast is rich in variety, spicy soup and beef patties are delicious 😋 I will choose to stay in this hotel next time!

The decoration of the hotel is full of nightclub style, and even the BGM has the feeling of a nightclub, which is surprising everywhere. The robes in the room are very comfortable and stylish.

I personally like their location, it is very convenient to go to the city that never sleeps or Nanhu Lake

Hygiene: very clean, no smell in the room
Environment: Needless to say, Qujiang Forte is a bit deprecated for its Internet celebrity hotel, but W Hotel still has fashion ➕ technology in it.
Service: The clothing is remarkable and the considerate service.
Smile sincerely. This time, I didn’t meet any service staff whose eyes are above the top. Every staff member is very enthusiastic and positive. From the lobby to the service to the restaurant, there is nothing to complain or give feedback
The only thing is that it is too difficult to serve food in the hotel BAR, and the service is lagging behind.

The cake is delicious , The handwritten cards are very careful, and the layout is very beautiful, which puts a perfect end to my trip to Xi'an. In addition, on the balcony, you can have a close view of the Qujiang Lake and the Big Wild Goose Pagoda from a distance. The breakfast is also very rich.

msg:After deciding on the May Day destination at the end of January, I started looking for hotels. I really had a lot of choices. After experiencing the distance between various attractions, I was still impressed by W. As a hotel under the Marriott Group, W is more youthful and energetic, and it spreads everywhere. Stylish, high-quality artwork is very eye-catching. This time, the little regret is that the baby wanted to live in a parent-child themed room, so he didn't choose the lake view room. But even so, the baby was amazed by the dazzling lights and shadows when he checked in, and he was reluctant to leave when he left. I knew he had chosen the right one.
The service is very considerate. There are real dolls and fun balloons with different themes every day, as well as the guidance of the lady in Hanfu and the handsome brother. You must order oily noodles and chicken soup noodles for breakfast.
In short, if you still come to Xi'an, you will still choose W, and even when you travel in the future, you will give priority to W in other regions. I wish you all the best!

Smoking is not permitted in the entire hotel. Violators are fined 2000. Contact the front desk to ask where is the smoking area. The answer is that if you want to smoke, please go downstairs and walk outside the hotel gate. I live in a store and smoke a cigarette so much. I remind smokers to think carefully before booking a room!

msg:Originally, I came to stay at the largest W Hotel in China with a heart full of expectations.
But it backfired. This is the worst five-star hotel I have ever stayed in in the world.
1. When checking in, it was supposed to be an upgrade to a room type with entitlement, but it turned out that the room type was not upgraded, but the floor was changed, and the room type was the same as originally booked. In fact, it didn't matter. It doesn't matter if you don't upgrade, but you can't fool me, you know, you can't let me. The check-in experience was downgraded. After all, I came here because of the reputation, but I was extremely disappointed.
2. Yesterday, I tasted the local specialty drink "Bingfeng". After drinking it, I thought it was quite good. I paid cash when I checked out today, but I didn't expect that not only did I pay in cash, but the deposit fee was also deducted. This behavior is really bad. I feel that the service is not suitable for such a large hotel. I also feel that the hotel is not responsible for a series of services after that. For things I do, I just say "I won't charge you more and refund you 20". I really don't need these 20, you can keep it. Buy Bingfeng, but I will definitely not choose your hotel again in the future. It's terrible.

To sum it up in one sentence: Except for some hardware, there is basically no service; there are problems reported to the hotel several times, but the hotel delays and does not reply.

1⃣️ 【Deposit issue】👎👎👎

On the evening of January 8, the attitude of the female manager on duty was poor, and the hotel's internal opinions on the deposit were inconsistent.

Checked in on the first night on the 7th, and wanted to continue staying on the 8th. The front desk said there was a room, but after a few minutes, it said there was no room (the reason for the difference in online and offline prices?), and then asked the manager on duty to call back, and waited for half an hour Didn't call back either, the shelf is big enough. Later, when I bought a suite, the manager on duty said that I needed to pay a deposit, and I agreed. When changing the room card the next day, the young man at the front desk said that there is no need to pay a deposit, and the previous 2,000 yuan can be continued.

In fact, whether to make up the deposit is not the point. The point is that the manager on duty is inconsistent with the statement of the front desk, which shows that the internal management of the hotel is chaotic, and the guests do not have a consistent sense of security.

2⃣️ There are no welcome fruits in the suites of more than 2,000 yuan, and there is no reminder for free snacks. 👎

In fact, it doesn’t matter whether you eat or not, who cares about what to eat, the focus is on the experience. W Hotel has no service, no details, but the details are the excellence of a hotel.

3⃣️ 【Food Safety Issues】👎👎👎👎👎

On the morning of the 10th, I ate at the restaurant on the first floor of the hotel. After returning to the room, the child felt uncomfortable and pale, and spit out all the noodles he had just eaten. I originally planned to go to Huashan that day, but seeing that the child was so uncomfortable, I planned to cancel the trip. It may be that the child has a good physique (gold medal in the school sports meeting for five consecutive years, and advanced swimming team class for 6 years), and after lying down for half an hour, he improved somewhat, otherwise he might go to the hospital to get water. The child said that the noodles were not cooked, and they were picked up after a few minutes of cooking, so they were not cooked enough to digest and vomited. I immediately reported this situation to the front desk, whether it is the restaurant's responsibility or not, please help me to ask. As a result, at night, the hotel did not reply to me. There was no investigation, no explanation, and nothing happened.

4⃣️ 【Delivery problem, customers are treated differently】👎

On the evening of the 10th, I ordered takeaway, because the homework collection in the parent group was due soon, so I didn’t have time to go down to get it, so I asked the waiter to help deliver it to the room. The reply from the front desk was: all the waiters have gone to help the guests find rooms, and there is no manpower; the takeaway is too big for the robot to fit, so I have to go down to pick it up. ❓Then I would like to ask: am I not a guest? The so-called 5-star hotel doesn't even have this service, and treats guests differently?

5⃣️ [The concierge called the black-hearted taxi to detour with the hotel signboard]
👎👎👎👎👎

Don't look at the service of W Hotel, you have good eyesight! On the 11th, we handed in the room card and were ready to return. In the lobby, before the revolving door, a young man in a khaki coat took the initiative to help drag the suitcase (because the suitcase marks the departure of the store, either to the airport or to the high-speed rail, the journey is far enough), and said to help car. I said don't take a detour, is safety guaranteed? He said that this is a convoy cooperated with the hotel, there is no detour, and there is no problem with guarantee. When I got in the car, I made it clear to the driver to take the expressway around the city in the west, not the expressway in the east. The driver said the cost was about 150 yuan, and I said yes. As a result, I got on the elevated highway, and I found that he still took the east expressway, and went around Dafa‼ ️I have had a driver's license for nearly 20 years, and I can still understand the map. I made it very clear, don't take detours, 🈶️The elderly and children are afraid of motion sickness, and have to catch a plane; the driver still made a detour! When I got off the bus, I said why do you still go this far? The driver said "almost the same". The metered price is 174.4 yuan (excluding tolls), and the distance is 61 kilometers. The receipt is attached.

Is this the so-called hotel's cooperative fleet? Deceiving customers with signs. You can do it to the elderly and children! want***? If you are short of money, just say it, it doesn’t matter if I give you a few hundred, my sister is not short of money, but you can’t do things like this, can you? ! You have to have a bottom line in life, right? ! Do you travel? When you leave Xi'an, you will also take other people's taxis. Will your elderly and children be cheated?

In addition, the male manager of the etiquette depar**ent told me: [It is useless for you to call 12345, you might as well tell me directly. 】😨 I was surprised to hear this sentence, does this mean that the Xi'an government is just a display? Inaction? You, a hotel worker, are more powerful than the government.

Another point to add: Due to the previous room renewal problem, the hotel took the initiative to upgrade the ordinary room on the 10th night to a suite on the 9th night, so we did not move. Thank you very much for this. But I also gave you a good review for one night. The subsequent problems not only affected our health and safety, but also brought great troubles to our itinerary! Moreover, I reported it to you several times, but you dragged on and remained silent.

The front desk means that we will give you a free upgrade for one night, can you see if these problems can not be written out. Sorry, I have given time to wait for your reply, but you have been slow to have a correct attitude. So this time, I can't help but comment honestly.

The above are the honest reviews of W Hotel Xi'an. In addition, the taxi ticket is attached, and the time, amount and kilometers are included. I hope Marriott's leaders can see this review, Xi'an W Hotel, it's time to rectify it!

Hygiene: Timely cleaning, clean and tidy, relatively satisfactory

Environment: I like the way I like it, I like the chandelier in the lobby

Service: Timely, that is, why did you take away my chocolate on the last day? The children were very disappointed when they returned to the room, because it was agreed the night before that they could eat chocolate when they came back the next day

The stylish design is reflected in the hotel lobby, elevators, bars, corridors, and various places in the room. Owen at the front desk has a warm service and a good attitude. He upgraded us The room, the room looking at the lake makes the mood more comfortable. The night view of the Spring Festival in Xi'an is beautiful, and the children and family members are very happy. The appearance of the Chinese New Year is vividly reflected here. The buffet breakfast has everything you need and is very distinctive, giving our whole family a different New Year experience.

msg:Let me tell you about my four-day and three-night stay at Xi’an W Hotel. I’ve stayed at several W hotels in other cities, including those in Shanghai, Guangzhou and Beijing, but I really like this one in Xi’an. Excellent, because I brought a car, so I got off the expressway very close to it, and the road is easy to walk, and the hotel faces the South Lake, so I can clearly see the lake view below from the room, very comfortable! At first I was hesitant to choose between the Canopy by Hilton Hotel near Datang Everbright City and the W Hotel in Nanhu, but later I felt that it was very wise to choose W Hotel. There should be no sense of happiness there! Now let’s talk about W’s service. From check-in to China to check-out, I feel that every service staff I come into contact with is very nice! Any needs will be met. On the third day, I happened to see the cleaning service staff near my room. I asked for a few more bottles of water, but the service staff directly brought me a whole bottle of mineral water. For me For this person who loves to drink water, this gesture really warms my heart! It’s Chinese New Year, I feel very caring ~ Needless to say, W breakfast is very good! The service staff are very good. There are a lot of people for breakfast during the Chinese New Year period, but we have a good seat every time and don't have to wait. On the last night, the floor drain in the bathroom of the room was blocked, and the water overflowed. The whole bathroom floor was covered with water. The hotel called the engineering depar**ent to come and fix it for me immediately, and the service staff also came to clean it immediately, and kept saying sorry for disturbing me. Thank you W for your efficient service~ I brought my parents with me during the Spring Festival trip. It was the first time for my parents to stay at W Hotel. They liked this hotel very much. They were full of praise and said that they would stay here again next time they come to Xi'an ~In short, this trip is very pleasant! Thank you W for bringing us a wonderful stay, happy new year! See you next time!

msg:Let's talk about the room first
This amazing suite is really amazing
There are not many doors in total, and two of them cannot be closed.
It's not that my door is broken
At least I made sure I didn't sleep in the hallway

let's talk about service
My takeaway arrived at 11:30, I called and asked the staff to deliver it for me
The other party said yes, it didn't arrive in half an hour, and I asked four times to no avail.
tell me i'm on do not disturb so the robot can't deliver
I said I didn't open it, man, and it was delivered by hand in ten minutes.
In the first sentence, guess what? It’s not a customer who kept you waiting. Sorry, this is your takeaway. Instead, you took out your mobile phone and showed me, and said, look, our robot came twice and didn’t contact me. This is a record, so it’s not a hotel. Even if the problem is not delivered, shouldn't the guest be asked the first time if there is a problem?
I don't understand very well, so your hotel means my problem?

The third is no service, no service, no service, the waiter is like a punk on the street who feels how honorable it is to work in W, for example, when you get off the bus, someone needs to come and open the door for you, no one, they are busy chatting, you have already got off the bus Don’t say anything about the poor service during the holidays. My best friend complained wildly to me before. I don’t believe it, so I left W and immediately went to Ritz National W. We have all lived in this unprecedented hotel, which made me feel down.
To sum up my review is rubbish among the rubbish
There is only one scene, nothing left
The hardware of the hotel in 19 years has been rotten for 3 years
Service as if totally untrained
By the way, there is blood in the room. My wife is good. I told my aunt to come and clean it. The aunt was very cute. When cleaning, she said that this is normal. Don't you mind? ! It's outrageous. Is your cleaning and maintenance useless for a hotel at this price?
They are as tough as terracotta warriors. I have to beg and coax them to get the most basic service. After I’m done, I’ll be tortured by yin and yang.

Oh yes, and the breakfast is the worst I've ever had
I forgot my scarf in the room before I left
After clearly informing the service staff where the room is
I searched for ten minutes and replied that I couldn't find it and lost it.
I said I'll go find it myself
Said I found it, I asked where I found it
Answer: I found it at the location I mentioned. He went into the room and looked around, but he didn’t look at the location I mentioned. I can only say 6

Xi'an W is the Tuhe concentration camp haha

I am very grateful to Jason Chen, the young man in the concierge these days, because I am alone with a child. It is the first time I come to Xi’an to travel. I am not familiar with the place. Xiao Chen is always very enthusiastic to help me Calling a car, helping me plan a travel route, helping me with my luggage, or helping me play with my children, made me feel embarrassed. I am really grateful to this young man for providing such a high-quality service. I hope to have the opportunity to travel to Xi'an again. I really like this warm city and our w hotel staff.

Let me talk about what I personally think is problematic: I stayed in three hotels in Xi’an during the same period, and Wyndham has the most standardized service. Of course, there are personal subjective things. Wyndham is a traditional five-star hotel. I don't like Tong's overalls.
The bathtub is big and deep with no place to lean on.
The exterior wall lights of the night scene seem to be turned off after 12 o'clock, so those who want to sleep before can only close the curtains.
Breakfast is the best of the three hotels.

After all, you are not close to the village, nor to the store, and you are not close to anywhere. As a result, the gym and swimming pool are not open. Of course, the epidemic is understandable, but if you don’t clearly mark it, it will easily affect your judgment. I feel that it is not as good as Four Seasons and Ritz-Carlton. There are also the following points, which I find very tasteless:
1. There is no integral switch at the entrance of the hotel, there is only a porch. I have to find the switch in the dark when I go back at night
2. The smart lights in the hotel are very unreasonable. I slept several times at night because I turned over and turned on automatically. I didn’t sleep well all night.
3. This carpet should be washed together
4. I found no paper in the whole bedroom, only the bathroom
5. There is a coffee machine and a kettle in this door. If there is not a gap in the door, I would not have found it
6. This toothbrush is wholesaled with Hanting, right?

All kinds of services are good, the service staff in the swimming pool are very enthusiastic, and I like the independent dressing room.
There are indeed a lot of people for breakfast, and the closing time is too early. Compared with the guests who stay in the hotel to relax, it is not convenient to go to breakfast in a hurry. You should refer to other hotels until 11 o'clock.
There are children's wash users and even body lotion, which is great; I forgot to bring facial cleanser, and the hotel provides facial cleanser, which is great!

The catering hot pot on the 3rd floor of the hotel is not very cost-effective. It is recommended to go to the 1st floor for a buffet.

msg:Originally planned to be in the northern suburbs of Bofeilang, Intercontinental, and chose W because of the epidemic.
InterContinental, Ritz overall feel more like a calm middle-aged consumer group
W is aimed more at the young generation facing the future.
 
From the point of view of eating, the glass crispy squab served in the lobby on the second floor is not as good as the Intercontinental squab.
Stir-fried abalone with spicy peppers is a bit interesting, with a cake, a bit of the mode of roujiamo.
The signature crab filled with small yellow croaker tastes good. It just takes a little longer to serve.

The next day, I took a look at the hot pot on the third floor, and I felt that the a la carte seafood was still too expensive.
But the waiter was nice, and informed the expected consumption in great detail.

In the evening, go to the seafood buffet on the first floor, which is more than 460.
Judging from the seafood and dishes provided, it is worth the price.
Service Ginger Sweet offered to recommend hairy crabs to me after seeing my seafood on the table.
As a person from the eastern city, I am no stranger to this, but I still thank him for his enthusiastic recommendation.
The waiter Cao Zhu saw that I was eating alone, and took the initiative to inform the tenants that there is a discount for catering.
Being able to think from the customer's point of view is the kingly way of the service industry.

As a personal tip, many guests end up with dessert.
It would be perfect if the ice cream can be improved with a stronger taste.

The freshly squeezed fried dough sticks in the morning are the highlight. I ate 6 sticks.
I don't know where the soybeans are used to grind the soy milk, and I can feel the long-lost original bean fragrance again.

The overall service is better than expected.

During the epidemic period, there were not too many guests, and the types of hot breakfast meals seemed to be relatively small. The nucleic acid point is a 5-minute walk. Overall, it is an online celebrity hotel worth experiencing

msg:To tell the truth, I was almost misled and gave up by those unscrupulous comments on the Internet (such as poor service, dirty rooms, hotels like nightclubs, thick quilts and soft beds, early check-in and late check-out...) The wonderful experience of the second W, I really don't know where those bad reviews come from?
First of all, I must thank the hotel front desk and the hotel steward named "The other party is entering". If it weren't for your careful and careful reply and thoughtful on-demand arrangement, maybe I would really miss this experience.
In just one day and one night, I stayed in the hotel all day, admiring and enjoying. I was attracted by the modern, fashionable and avant-garde artistic style in the hotel, whether it was the color and shape of the lights, the sculptures in the public areas and rooms, Paintings and installation art all moved me. The hotel is like a contemporary art museum. The W Hotel built with exquisite marble, steel bars and dreamy LED lighting effects is truly unparalleled. The Yan Yan Chinese restaurant on the second floor produces Michelin-like products with all the colors, fragrances, and lifelike paintings that travel through time and space. The coffee cups and tea cups in the room are beautifully designed, but unfortunately the boutique is out of stock.
Of course, no matter how good a hotel is, there will be some regrets. If you can make some adjus**ents, it will be more perfect. For example: 1. Bathroom supplies need to be adjusted and improved, whether it is the taste of toothbrushes, hair dryers, and toiletries. 2. Room service is not fast enough. 3. The food in the breakfast room on the first floor is very general. 4. There is no place to know more about the hotel's super design style concept.
However, none of these will affect my perfect experience with W Hotel. Thanks again to W Hotel for making my dream come true on the occasion of my birthday. If I have the opportunity to come back to Xi'an, W Hotel will be my first choice. I believe there will be a future.

msg:W Hotel Xi'an is the second hotel I stayed in during my trip to Xi'an. I stayed for three nights. Catching up with the severe epidemic, the hotel's SPA, fitness swimming and other facilities have been suspended, and the room price has also been reduced from before the epidemic. However, under the communication between Ctrip's customer service and the hotel, the price I booked was adjusted according to the period of stay. When I checked in, the manager chose a very good room for me, and gave me breakfast and a fruit plate, which made me feel very warm at the beginning of my stay.
The room service heard that I like drinking tea, so they sent extra water and tea bags. When I checked out, JoJo at the front desk gave me a blindfold. I didn't remember the name of the girl in the bar service on the 4th night. It was very funny and humorous, super nice~
Everyone doesn't want to think about the epidemic, but I can see that many staff of the W Hotel are really working hard, and I feel it~
Of course, the management level of different internal depar**ents is different, but the flaws are not concealed. I like it very much. I will live here next time I come to Xi'an. The reason is too good.

msg:The environment is good, the lake view room is really amazing.
Service: The service concept is good, and the guests are really the first! I drove my son over for vacation. I am very grateful to the little brother who guarded the gate of the underground parking lot for discussing each case one by one during the epidemic prevention and control period, fully understanding the guests and giving humane trea**ent. I also thank the foreman on the first floor that afternoon for personally walking the two of us to the nucleic acid testing site. And thanks to the lady in the room service line, we asked for mineral water, and she responded to every request without saying anything. Thanks to the technical master on the ninth floor for explaining how to use the air-conditioning panel, and what is touching is the second door-to-door return visit. Thanks to the reception staff in the lobby for helping me deal with the license plate when I forgot to register the license plate and was about to leave the venue. They immediately asked for help and solved it immediately, with first-class efficiency. The most important thing is that the children's two summer vacation homework was pressed under the TV tray and did not take away. When I got home, I found that I was very anxious. I immediately called the hotel front desk. Thank you Birdy for taking the trouble to answer my several rounds of calls and help contact the housekeeping depar**ent. After repeatedly entering the room to search, I finally found the valuable composition texts and homework books. Otherwise, the children will have to make up for it from the beginning as soon as the school starts. In short, this is the most advanced service concept among the high-end hotels I have stayed in in Xi'an. Just a little suggestion, the cleaning lady has to unplug the kettle every time she cleans up and put it back into the base. She also unplugs my mobile phone charger every time and reels the cord. When I come back, I always take off the water boiler as if I just moved in, flip the chassis and pull out the charging head, and then go around the coffee cup to reach the socket. The same is true of mobile phone charging. Once, I wound the wire around it and solved it for a long time. I think this might be for safety, but I'm not quite used to it yet.
The only time I felt bad was when I was swimming. The child took my swimming cap. I didn't have a swimming cap. I wanted to keep the child inconvenient to buy it, so I told the lifeguard. He immediately spoke to the staff outside, saying Please take the time to send in a lady's swimming cap. After the other side agreed, I kept waiting for ten minutes, but no one came in the end. In desperation, I asked the children not to go into the water by themselves, so I walked out in a bathing suit, wrapped in a bath towel and bought a swimming cap. When I saw two pool front desk staff, one man and one woman, I said, I've been waiting. They said we were too busy. I said, I'm sorry, I didn't bother you on purpose, I was mainly with children. Neither of them answered me. I can only take the swimming cap and go back to the pool. This is the only unpleasant memory. However, the overall experience of the stay is still very good.
Environment: near the lake, near the garden, concept decoration, excellent service. Beautiful inside and out.

msg:I was traveling with my family in Xi'an. I booked a room for the night view of Qujiang River and the indoor and outdoor swimming pools. I basically stayed in the hotel for more than 24 hours. After the experience, W was still remarkable and worth recommending.

From the hotel's tone, it can be seen that W is more inclined to urban young people, but they have taken care of parent-child families in some details. For example, the doorman and lobby staff are very friendly to children, and they also provide children's slippers (suitable for children under 1.4m. My child is too big to wear, but the child said the slippers are very comfortable) and toiletries. The child accidentally fell in the lobby and cried in pain. The waiter quickly came with a medical box to check, comforted the child and sprayed Yunnan Baiyao, and also told him to tell them at any time if he needed other help. This feeling of being cared for in time is particularly heartwarming, which is a plus for the hotel and also shows the management level.

The doorman and concierge staff of W are all dressed in casual clothes, unlike other hotel waiters who are dressed in suits. When I just got off the car, I was startled by the young men who suddenly came forward to greet me with luggage, because it was so neighborly. The hotel also did a good job in epidemic prevention inspections for people entering and leaving the hotel. The entrance and exit were clearly divided, and a special person guided the guests to scan the code and fill out the epidemic prevention guarantee. If the guests who have checked in frequently enter and exit the hotel, they can just show their room cards. It is not very dogmatic.

There is also a ** takeaway cabinet on one side of the hotel entrance, which is very convenient for ordering takeaways. We stayed at W on our last night in Xi'an. We were completely impressed by the kingdom of carbon water for many days. Adults and children couldn't eat the hotel breakfast. This takeaway cabinet also reflects the hotel's inclusiveness and orderliness, which is convenient and not chaotic.

Let's talk about the night view of Qujiang. In order to have a good perspective, I chose a stunning lake view room, but when I checked in, the girl at the front desk said that only the 17th floor was ready for immediate check-in, and showed me the floor plan of the hotel room. For my first stay, I actually had no idea about the direction of the room, so I thought I would check in quickly with my family. The 17th floor should be the lower one among the high floors. Actually, this is okay, but the room 1701 can't actually see the whole lake view. It will be partially blocked by the building (see picture). You may need to book a suite on the corner of the high floor. As for the night view, although the sensory perception is also good, it is not amazing. Whether it is worth choosing depends on the individual. Oh yes, the girl at the front desk may not have chosen a satisfactory floor for me, so she gave me three bar experience coupons, which can be used to drink three special cocktails for free. The bartender knew that we were with children and made a non-alcoholic one for us. We all thought it was delicious!

Let's talk about the swimming pool, which is really great! It is big enough, the water temperature is suitable, and it is very refreshing to swim. The depth and steps are also very friendly to children. Because it is big enough, even if there are many people, it doesn't feel so noisy and crowded. There are also many lounge chairs for rest around the swimming pool, so there will be no problem of finding a place to rest. It is worth mentioning that the staff's inspection of the swimming pool is very timely and serious, which gives people a sense of peace of mind. The outdoor pool is open at 1 a.m. every day. The water is too cold in the morning. The outdoor pool is very shallow, suitable for children to play in the water and adults to pose for photos. Compared with the indoor pool, it has a better summer feeling and is more joyful. The only thing is that the adults who take care of it have to endure high temperatures and partial exposure to the sun (the umbrella is not big enough and the shade area is limited). The only bad experience in the swimming pool was that the child went into the water when the outdoor pool was just opened, but soon got hurt by the small stones at the bottom of the pool. It hurt when standing. The waiter was found in time, but he insisted that there was no problem with the swimming pool after seeing the child's injury. They had just done a system inspection a while ago, implying that there would be no foreign objects. The child's injury may not have occurred in the swimming pool, but I believe that an 8-year-old child will not lie, but I also feel that there is no need to argue with the waiter in front of the child, because there is already an injury, and comforting the child is the most important thing. The child probably also felt that the waiter uncle seemed to think she was lying. She later wiped a very small pebble in the injured water area and quickly showed it to me to prove that there was indeed a foreign object at the bottom of the pool. When I handed the pebble to the waiter, I reminded him that the foreign objects at the bottom of the pool were dangerous. There are so many delicate children, and anyone who steps on them may be injured, but he just responded to me with an "oh" and did not express his apology.

But the flaws do not outweigh the merits. I recommend W!

There are few types of breakfast and the quality is also very general. Originally took the baby to experience the parent-child room. But the view outside the window was disappointing. The door lock was broken, and the hotel's hair dryer was broken. I feel that any hotel with more than 800 yuan in Sanya is better than the one here, and the service is also very confusing. Called before going to say there was room, and waited for an hour when we arrived. When checking in, the corridor was under maintenance, and the smell was very pungent. The hotel staff said that your room had no smell. Also, let’s talk about the elevator. After pressing the elevator, if you wait on No. 1 and the door on No. 3 opens, you will definitely be closed when you go from 1 to 3. Every time you wait for the elevator, you feel very nervous, you have to keep up with it at a special speed. With a baby and luggage, the challenge is quite big. When I left the store, I was inexplicably charged more than 1,000 bills. I said that I signed the bill. I asked to call for monitoring, and said that I would pay us the bill first. They made a mistake and they will handle it by themselves... I have stayed at the W hotel a few times, but this hotel really made me speechless

msg:Another very satisfying stay after W Kuala Lumpur! Thank you Miss Han Miao from W Hotel for her attentive service throughout the whole process.
1. The facade of the hotel is really beautiful! It is easy to make a film at night when the lights change.
2. The hotel lobby is my favorite part, the overall a**osphere is great! Just above the lobby, the galaxy designed by Hong Kong AB Concept design company is very shocking! With W's unique nightclub-style music, my heart has already danced with the music.
3. The hardware facilities of the hotel are also very good. The swimming pool is on the negative first floor. There is also a unique camping tent outside the Woo bar next to the lobby on the first floor. It is very pleasant to have a drink in the breeze.
The layout of the room is reasonable, as soon as you enter the door is the cloakroom. The bed was super comfortable and soft. The color matching of the pillows on the sofa is also very cute. There is also a large terrace where you can sit outside and watch the night view of Qujiang Pond.
Be sure to come back in the evening to watch a sunset, it's really beautiful~
4. Miss Han Miao also gave welcome fruits and cakes. The cakes are not only beautiful, but also delicious.
5. Special praise to the staff in charge of breakfast. The breakfast is next to the lobby on the first floor, and there are many varieties. The restaurant is beautifully displayed and has a good ambience. In addition to the conventional dishes, there are smoked salmon, local oil-splashed noodles, etc., as well as Hong Kong-style pastries, there are many choices. The service of the restaurant staff is very enthusiastic. If you are missing anything, you can make it up immediately and deliver what you need to you. It's really fast and good! Much better than other 5 star hotels.
6. Miss Han Miao specially arranged someone to provide turndown service.

There seems to be a villa area. In a small park in Qujiang District downstairs, many people run around the lake. We also joined in the run on the third morning. The geographical location and transportation are more like Qianjiang New Town in Hangzhou. Those who like the oldmoney feel can choose other hotels. The night view is really good~


🧹Hygiene: In general, I picked up several dandruff like big dandruff on the sofa when I arrived at the hotel

🔔Service: Come, let's talk about this. First of all, we went downstairs with my husband on Friday night and wanted to have a drink. The bar that comes with W has only two pairs of people sitting outside (it seems to be a natural hike chair?) It’s a copycat… and there’s no W It should have a lively texture... It makes people very puzzled and can only go back in anger... Then this breakfast bar is really a robbery a**osphere... I am a mother... The waiters are already too busy to focus on their work... That's okay. , We were most surprised. We called a car when we left the hotel. Just when the big bags and small bags needed to get on the bus, my husband asked me to get on the bus first, and I would put n pieces of luggage on the bus with the staff. Less than three meters up, a young man in reddish-brown clothes stood. He stood upright like this and glanced sideways at my husband who had no desire to help. At that time, there were no customers in need of service. Too much... Haha I'm shocked... When I got home, I talked to my husband about this and he just said one thing... Yeah, is it a little weird? 🤔A luxury level hotel, two faces when guests arrive and when they leave... It's also a bit too powerful

msg:The real feeling of staying at the W hotel for the first time
Objective evaluation, let's talk about the bad feeling first:
1. Yingbin failed to implement the epidemic prevention policy. After calling the supervisor to clarify the situation, he still took a strong attitude to find reasons instead of expressing apology even though he knew that he had handled it improperly. I think that any hotel should be equipped with relevant policy learning, emergency response capabilities and service concepts with adequate training, not to mention five stars.
2. The hotel toothbrush is the experience of an ordinary guest house, with inferior materials, rustic color and hair loss. The same is true for combs. The packaging of the soap is poor.
3. The backwater of the toilet is very long and noisy. (Whether the same is true for other rooms, no check in, no right to speak)
4. The sound insulation effect is very poor, whether it is the sound insulation of the corridor and the room, or the sound insulation of the room and the room. In the middle of the night, the disputes between the guests next door, and the noise of the children in the corridor after seven in the morning. The sound is loud and real, which seriously affects sleep.
5. Except for two bottles of mineral water in the minibar, all items need to be charged, which is somewhat unsatisfactory compared with most of the five-star free snacks.
6. The bed is a super soft bed, and the softness and hardness are not moderate. Of course, it varies from person to person as to which softness and hardness of the bed are preferred.
Say goodbye to:
1. First of all, if you are a friend who comes to travel, the complete commercial facilities downstairs (catering, bars, supermarkets, and nearby shopping malls), as well as the unobstructed view of the South Lake, are very worth looking forward to. From this point of view, the hotel price is very reasonable. And the hotel decoration is also very beautiful.
2. Free room upgrade service is a plus point for experience.
3. The dry and wet separation of the toilet is done well, and there is a long wash area between the toilet and the bathroom. Avoid embarrassment when using at the same time.
4. The bathtub by the window and the balcony with view are suitable for those who pursue romance.
5. There is a separate sheet between the quilt and the bed. This is a great psychological comfort for guests who are obsessed with cleanliness, and it is also conducive to the cleaning of the hotel in the later period.

Because it was for my child's birthday, I contacted the hotel, and a manager named Phoebe arranged the room very thoughtfully and gave a cake. The child was very happy. Next, I will explain the specific situation in detail
Hardware: Needless to say, the facilities and equipment are very good. The teal in the bath, the sound insulation of the room, the mattress and the pillows are very good.
Supporting facilities: There are three swimming pools, only two are indoors, and the children's pool is a hot spring. The gym is also huge and the bar has good acoustics at night.
Breakfast: There are a lot of varieties, and there are not many people at the table, so it is very pleasant to eat.
Service: The account manager is very good. Within five minutes after entering the room, the room brought children's toiletries and slippers and bathrobes.
A final suggestion: as a luxury hotel, the quality of toothbrushes and combs is lacking, not as good as Jiji Atour. In addition, in addition to water, coffee, and tea bags, the few other drinks and snacks in the room are charged. Finally, it is recommended to put a striking men's free entry card at the entrance of the women's locker room in the swimming pool.

The environment is good, the service is good, and the scenery of the South Lake in the stunning lake view room is also invincible! When I booked the room, I only booked one breakfast, and the front desk manager also gave breakfast for two people, one big and one small. What a good experience!

The large balcony is complemented by the lake view of Qujiang Pond, and in the evening, there is a nearby Chang'an restaurant for dining. It is very convenient and the scenery is beautiful. Hello, Jingmei, friends manually like 👍 especially when I came in and checked in, the handsome guy Owen helped me upgrade the lake view room, and was very enthusiastic and patient. Answered many of my questions and helped me analyze how to stay affordable. Kindly explain the meal matters. This stay experience is really amazing!

At night, the Big Wild Goose Pagoda will cost more than ten yuan for a taxi. There is a lake downstairs, which is very suitable for walking, and there are many bars, a paradise for young people. The internal facilities are also great, the bed is super large, the room is soundproofed, the bathroom shower is very big, and the manager also presents a fruit plate every day. Finally, I would like to commend the lighting and music in the lobby at night, just like being in a nightclub. If you like this style, you must come and feel it. The paintings hanging around also feel that the ladies of the Tang Dynasty made the pop style.

msg:This time I stayed in the Fengyun Suite and felt better than the last time, but there are still shortcomings that need to be improved. The overall experience is good, the room is more comfortable and the space is sufficient, but the hygiene needs to be paid more attention to. Well, first of all, the new one brought by the waiter in the child's bathrobe is a mess of hair, which makes people feel uncomfortable. Second, the bathroom sink feels dirty as soon as the suite enters the door. This should not be the hygiene of a five-star hotel. I think it should be more careful cleaning! The view of the suite is very good. The South Lake has an unobstructed view and a wide field of vision!

Adjacent to the South Lake, surrounded by Gemdale Plaza, there are many craft wine bars and his own bar downstairs. Thanks to Elise on call for helping with late check out.

Should have stocked up a few more. Let’s talk about the lack of it, the package bought before the epidemic, after the epidemic resumed work, the hotel swimming pool did not open for a long time, but the date of the package is not extended by one day, which is inhumane! After all, due to the epidemic, it could not be used for a month in the middle, so it may be cheap. No one took the initiative to contact you after making the reservation, because dinner is included, and other similar hotels will have someone call to help you book dinner. No one cares about you. Maybe you still think the package is cheap. There are many people in the pool, like dumplings, not like a five-star hotel. There is no children's playground, and children don't play much.

According to my needs, Checy upgraded my room for free and arranged a welcome fruit.
This is the first time I have stayed at the W hotel brand. The public areas and guest rooms are trendy and luxurious. You can enjoy the beautiful scenery of Qujiang from the balcony. The overall check-in experience is very enjoyable. The customer service like Miss Checy's personal butler is warm and thoughtful. I highly recommend Xi'an W Hotel😘😘😘

msg:This time I went to Xi'an with my wife, thinking about living better. The W Hotel I saw in Xiaohongshu ranked first in Xi'an. I chose it without hesitation. The moment I arrived at the hotel was truly amazing. This design is full of youthful feeling, and every little detail can see that the designer's ideas are unique and very powerful. But after staying for a long time, the problem arises. Originally thinking of staying for five days, I checked out early and went to Sofitel Legend. Reasons: 1. On the first day of check-in, the sound of repairing water pipes, drilling walls, and opening and closing doors in the middle of the night! I have seen the soundproofing of this five-star hotel. 2. When I returned to the hotel the next night, I found that the empty water bottle I put behind the door was confiscated, and the shower gel used last night in the bathroom was not taken away or the bottle cap was open. This hygiene made me wonder if there was any. Clean up, whether the sanitation of the hotel is up to standard! 3. The way to deal with things after this happens in the off-season is not very professional. In terms of service, it is recommended to learn from Sofitel Legend. (I am not a legendary writer) Advantages: 1. You can see a beautiful night view of lights at night. 2. Downstairs, there are many things that young people like and are very energetic! 3. Design is invincible. I think design is worth five points.

This time I learned that Xi’an W is the largest family in China and has a good reputation, so I tried to move in. This time I really brushed back the good feelings I had for W. The gradual red color of the room is very high-end, large and spacious. Two people can almost get lost in the room. The hair dryer is Dyson, and the bedding is comfortable, so you can sleep when you lie down. The snack bar in the room is free, and there is a bottle of white wine and a bottle of red wine. After drinking red wine on the first night, I made a bottle of red wine the next day, which is really full of bonus points. The balcony scenery is also a must, overlooking the entire park lake. Chloe Tian Yixin, the waiter at the front desk, was very enthusiastic in his service and met one of my requests on the phone. Hope that all domestic W can reach the level of Xi'an W quality.

msg:Stunning suite stayed for a week during the Chinese New Year. I felt good. I couldn’t go out on National Day. I just stayed here for a few days. During the New Year, happy hour was closed due to the epidemic.
Breakfast: superb, super variety, Chinese and western food, hot and cold food, as well as Shaanxi special snacks, freshly squeezed watermelon juice, the end of 10 shops, basically have to wait in line after nine o'clock
Facilities: The room is fully automatic. The curtains are automatically closed when you leave the room. The curtains are automatically opened when you enter the room. The sensor light in the dressing area is very intimate, but the socket under the dressing table cannot be used. The service robot is super cute. The super large balcony overlooks the South Lake at 270°.
🍃Environment: The suite can see the entire Nanhu Lake. You can walk into Nanhu Park in 5 minutes. You can see Nanhu Lake from the bed.
🧹Hygienic: Satisfied, there is basically no problem. Make a turn-down. Be able to clean up the room according to the guests’ living habits. Fruits on the first day
🔔Service: All others have full marks. I am only dissatisfied with the waiters who are tall on the floor and can’t speak Mandarin because I never expected that I would be involved in the waiters’ infighting when I stay in a hotel.
1. I went back to the room the next day and found that the door card was invalid. I found the tall lady on the floor and the waiter opened the door. She asked me to use the floor phone to call by myself. After I picked up the phone, the attitude of the other party was very bad. Why do guests make internal calls? After I made it clear that it was a guest, the attitude of the other party changed. After checking the information, the other party said to the waiter and hung up. I was dumbfounded and told the tall waiter that she said she would tell you allusions. The tall one is very fierce and said in Shaanxi dialect "You should say me Let me listen to the phone next to you" Now that you know the workflow, why do you let the guest be caught in between you? And the other party didn't give me a chance to speak
2. After checking out, I found that the bedside charging cable was not brought. Ask the front desk on the first floor to ask upstairs to find the waiter on the first floor and say that I didn't see it before the room round. I asked them on the phone and said that they had checked upstairs and there were no missing items. Then I asked them to check it again and waited for five minutes without replying, so I asked a man from the concierge to go upstairs to find the result. They found it and brought down the empty sample bottle.

msg:Tell the truth
When I started staying at the university hotel, there were very few people who went to the back for breakfast and had to queue up. The quality of the hotel staff really needs to be improved. It took a lot of thought to build the hotel. The security of the hotel needs to scan the code when I enter the hotel from the garage. We cooperate. If he needs the itinerary code, I will also cooperate. This is a national policy. It is an obligation to cooperate, but when a few people next to us went in, they said that they had already checked in without scanning the code. I asked us for the room card, provided that we all scanned the code. I asked the security why the people in front didn't want them to show the room card. You have to check our room card. I feel that I have been treated differently. Your hotel should be everyone for check-in. The things that need to be shown are the same, I just ask him. He is more temperamental than me and ignores us. We make us have to show the room card. I say you call your manager down, which makes me even more angry. As a manager, you are still in the service industry. Come over and talk like a ********, I feel super amateur, I don't have any level, I don't listen to customers. I don't believe in hotel training. I don't have training. Every sentence is swearing. I really don’t know how the management of w has positioned their hotel. We were so angry that we didn’t write any more. Finally, we came to our staff. We will understand the situation and deal with it, and there is no text until now. I live in the Ritz-Carlton and a similar situation occurs. The treatment of others can really make people feel that they are helping you deal with problems. Hotel customers go to live and let you bully like this?

Location: Dayan Pagoda Resort｜333 Qujiangchi East Road
The lobby is a huge music bar. Colorful lights, modern sculptures, unconsciously activate every cell of your body, dancing with the rhythm💃

Fully automatic curtains, TV, lights, and TV music seem to bring people to the beach at once! Super sense! The surround speakers in the living room can be connected to Bluetooth! The sound quality is so good that you can dance for a few hours!
Whether the minibar in the living room is a fully automatic capsule coffee machine, or if you want to adjust a mojito, it’s up to you!
The lighting a**osphere of the room is superb, the toilet in the bathroom comes with breathing color a**osphere lights, and you can enjoy relaxing when you go to the toilet.
W at night, the lights and music in the lobby are all fascinating, extremely ambiguous, and I have to say that I have to take a picture with the woo bar, which is great to take a swimsuit to take pictures.
🏋️‍♂️Gym, swimming pool, sports are full of details.
Bliss a full set of toiletries (facial cleanser, cleansing oil, bubble bath), net celebrity bathtub, bathroom tiles will be automatically heated.
Key points: The service is great, anniversaries, birthdays, the hotel will not prepare surprises!
Recommended room types: stunning lake-view room, exquisite suite, Fengyun suite (the suite has a Dyson hair dryer, it’s also great for girls to take pictures!)

🔔Service:

The whole hotel is full of sense of science and technology and avant-garde. The decoration and equipment in the rooms are very advanced and have W characteristics.
Especially the hotel staff, the sense of service is in place. Jojo at the front desk was very considerate from check-in, introducing the hotel and room types, and the welcoming little brother also helped send luggage to the room. When jojo checked out, he asked if there was anything he needed to help. When he left, he bid farewell and gave the hotel a small gift. Ella, the room manager, is really attentive. After check-in, he took the initiative to ask if there was any request and help. He attached great importance to every detail and provided us with a lot of help, which gave us a very good check-in experience. , Thanks to them two, let us feel that we have a home away from home service experience. Every employee in the hotel is very enthusiastic and greets warmly every time I see it. This is my best hotel experience so far.
Later, when family and friends come to Xi’an to travel, they must strongly recommend Xi’an W Hotel to stay. As expected, the Marriott brand is very trustworthy.

msg:The Asian flagship store, the actual experience is average. Strong nightclub style. As a post-90s generation, I don’t know how to appreciate it. My son really likes it. The stunning twin room does not have a lake view, but the scenery outside the window is average. The facilities in the room are very smart. The open-air swimming pool will be after 2pm. The indoor swimming pool is very large and very satisfied, but the room rate of nearly 3k is not very pleasant. When I go back in the evening, all the exterior lights have been turned off. It is estimated that it may affect the rest of the residents.
I heard that the breakfast was good, but I slept until 11 o'clock and the breakfast was over. I heard that W restaurant refused to eat in their LOGO slippers. My mother was very smart and wore Ritz slippers. In the end, she was asked to go back to the room to change her shoes because she was worried about slipping. This explanation was fine. It seems that there are still balloons, and the two children came back with them.
The late check-out time card is relatively tight, and the general feeling is that the service is average, generally very average, I still like Suzhou W!
Finally complained about their garage, it is very easy to dizzy when going down at night, and every time you go out, you have to go to the front desk to register your license plate, which is very inconvenient!

msg:The environment and hygiene are good. W has always been named with fashion trends. Xi'an W is the largest in Asia and the only W in Northwest China is considered very good. The only downside is that there are too many people for breakfast in the morning and you have to wait in line. Arrange a location for me close to 100 meters from the vegetable picking area. It is very inconvenient. As the largest in Asia, I have not seen how big the restaurant is, and the opening and closing time of breakfast is only 2 hours. This makes people have to get up early.

msg:Self-driving from Hangzhou, I finally came to Xi’an after a long journey. I stayed at the pet-friendly hotel W. The hotel prepared dog kennels and bowls. However, I think Xi’an has to provide pets according to the standard if the pet fee is charged according to the national standard Service, such as customized dog leashes and humanized pet food. After all, I have stayed in Shanghai W. There is no harm if there is no comparison... But from another perspective, Xi’an is a city where there are hotels where dogs can stay. Yes, the room has a big balcony, and you can also see the big lawn and Qujiang Pool downstairs, so beautiful scenery... There is a separate parking lot, and the hotel can be reached by elevator directly. The parking lot is also very beautiful... The hotel is also very cool Especially at night, the stairs in the lobby and the chandeliers in the lobby are very fashionable...the breakfast is very rich, it is recommended to pay attention to the taste of siu-mai and the quality of the sausage, other things are OK, you must praise the Mia at the front desk, the service is very good. , I also specially prepared fruit for me, and took the trouble to solve my doubts, thank you for the reception. In addition, I want to give feedback. I found soot on the floor of the bathroom in the room. My husband and I don’t smoke...

msg:Have lived a lot of W. W stunning set in Suzhou on the banks of Jinji Lake, W fantasy set on the Bund on the banks of the Huangpu River. But this time the most memorable is the Xi'an W in Qujiang. Personally think that sets are the essence of W. I am especially grateful to the front desk lady jojo for her kind help, because the room has not been cleaned, she intimately provided us with a rest room, and actively helped us to contact and coordinate, and was promoted to the Fengyun Suite. It is precisely because of her that this trip to Xi'an left unforgettable memories. The 120-level take-off area can only be described as stunning. W's facilities and hardware have always been top-notch, Xi'an W is even more of a benchmark among W hotels in China, but I want to say that compared to the hardware configuration and meticulous service, the latter is more touching. This time jojo helped me deeply understand the avant-garde service concept of this young hotel brand. Thanks 🙏

If I had a previous impression of the hotel with a score of 7.8, this stay was really due to the intimate service of the guest, Miss Kiki, which made me right at once. The impression of hotel w has a full mark! ! ! The young lady is really caring. We brought the baby out together. After we booked the room, we called us and asked if we have any other needs. You can tell her in advance. After hearing that we have a baby, we will prepare a room for us. Set of children's toiletries. We booked the Fengyun Suite with a 270 degree balcony. After I checked in, I wanted a room with a better view of the lake. Miss sister also immediately tried to help me take care of it, and told me to contact her if I needed it. Thank her very much.
Besides the hotel, the overall decoration of the hotel, as well as the layout of the rooms, including the corridors are very stylish and avant-garde, and the scenery is everywhere, especially in the evening the whole lobby is very beautiful.
This is really a very pleasant experience.

It was clearly 23,000 pre-authorized, but it was said to be 20,000. After deducting the paid room fee, I called to recover more than 300 yuan. Fortunately, my memory is relatively good. The front desk I contacted said that the pre-authorization was 23,000, and the reply said that I made a mistake and should refund me the difference of more than 2,000. But waiting for a refund and waiting to be ignored, with a cold attitude, not replying to the questions raised, and still not getting a refund so far, called the front desk badly! Will not stay again next time!

1. In the middle of the night, I was directly woken up by a drunk man smashing the door at 1:00 in the morning, but contacted the hotel but did nothing, which is extremely unable to protect the personal safety of the guests.
2. During breakfast, the chef cooked a mask for us to eat. There is no apology at all. Once again, the safety of food cannot be guaranteed.
3. The hotel is not worth more than 2,000 yuan at all. Don't look at the online marketing account anymore. It's all bought and brushed.
   According to the above reply from the manager on duty, if you want to continue your stay, I will give you a discount. If you do not continue your stay, it will end. This hotel is to stay for one day and kill a person without considering the customer's feelings at all. Don't be slaughtered like sheep. Three people, three rooms, 6,000 yuan, just smashed into it ruthlessly, and will not consider any hotels under Marriott in the future.

msg:I wanted to write this review a long time ago, but because I asked the travel agency to book a room for three nights to save trouble, I was not given the opportunity to comment on Ctrip and **. Here are a few things for your reference: 1. I chose a larger ✈️ on the day of arrival, but I arrived at the hotel at 1:20. The front desk said that only one room on the fifth floor was being cleaned and it would be finished in about half an hour. As a result, I waited for Tongfu Lobster downstairs until 2:30 and then called to inform me that the room was ready. In the elevator to the room, in the corridor, and on the seats outside at night, I basically didn't meet any guests staying in the hotel and there were large blocks of empty rooms. In other words, I didn't consider upgrading at all. Compared with the W service in the southeast coast, this is a second scum! There is basically no room arrangement, but they will take the initiative to upgrade. The most impressive one is Suzhou W. Once a friend went late and only had the lowest configuration, and we arrived early and all were upgraded. The most funny thing here is that they only ask if you are a member after you have completed the application, and there is no expression after asking. Marriott's gold medal members are nothing! 2. The room manual says there are anti-snoring pillows, but I called and they said there are only two other types. The laundry manual said that it would be delivered on the same day before 6pm. As a result, I received four calls on the way to play. One said that it would be ready before 12pm the next day, and the other said that it would be ready at 6pm the next day. In short, I just got it the next night without rushing. If I had known this, wouldn’t I have washed it myself? 3. The management is very chaotic. I added another night to my itinerary temporarily and booked another night at the ** flagship store. The day before, I took the room card to the front desk to register while I went downstairs to get takeout. As a result, the hotel called again on the second day during the tour to urge me to check out. After I said that I had extended my stay, they asked me a lot of questions before hanging up the phone.
Is your system not interconnected? Fortunately, I booked one more night at **, so I can write a real review for everyone to refer to. Anyway, I am going to try Rika next time, so it doesn’t matter if I don’t stay in this hotel!

2. The design of the room is modern and the hardware is relatively new, but the sound insulation of the floor is general, and the sound of beating upstairs can be heard at twelve o'clock in the middle of the night.
3. The service is the most infuriating point. The first staff member at the door asked about the history of sojourn and rudely asked where you came from. After handing over a list, you signed it, and there was no polite language at all; The night shift manager was also completely rude. After answering the question, he turned his head and left as if he owed him. Personally, the language attitude of the other party directly lowered the impression of the hotel, and even for a moment made me feel that I was going to quarantine instead of staying in a hotel. In all honesty, this is the first time that a hotel at home and abroad has encountered a star-rated hotel with such a disappointing service attitude and professionalism. It is not the first time that the service of your hotel has been questioned after reading the little red book. In general, the good impression of the city in Xi'an for the first time has been seriously affected.
4. The switch on one side of the washbasin is broken, only hot water can be produced, and regular inspections are lacking.

msg:假期入住真實感受：
1、 房間非常不錯，雙床房每張床都是 1.5 米的，床很大睡着很舒適。
2、 酒店服務很棒，當天入住已經是凌晨一點，辦理入住僅是用了 5 分鐘搞定，而且到了房間連續找了兩次服務人員，增加小孩拖鞋和洗漱用品，都非常有耐心。
3、 早餐體驗很贊，品種很多，檔次很高，尤其鮮榨果汁非常新鮮，提倡隨量取餐。
4、 特別強調：酒店健身房和游泳池非常不錯，我連續體驗了 2次。
有機會再到西安遊玩，還會入住 W 酒店。

msg:硬件確實很好，性價比也蠻高，早飯很不錯，送的雞尾酒也不錯。
房間也很漂亮，吃飯特別方便，酒店合作的龍蝦漢堡餐廳也好吃。
説説缺點吧，服務沒跟上，從前台開始就感覺很隨意，然後晚上去酒吧，有兩個小哥第二天早上在在在早餐廳也看到了，這得多辛苦啊，這麼大體量的酒店不至於這麼節省人工吧，酒吧的員工服務的方向應該和早餐廳不一樣吧哈哈哈哈，而且晚上酒吧人手很少，感覺他們很辛苦，就三四個人要服務裏面酒吧和外面一部分露台
然後沒有開夜窗也很失望，能感受到當年業主花了很大的裝修成本，可能是疫情到時經營成本太高？
客房服務倒是不錯，門口迎來送往的小哥也很專業。裏面的服務就感覺太一般了，沒有匹配到這個價格該有的。

msg:整理來講，我認為沒有拍照打卡需求的話，w酒店住的性價比相當低。

首先，我還是要感謝前台小姐姐給升級了房型，你原本應該是想要我寫好評，也的確多虧你的房型升級不然我應該會給差評，就不是現在這個中評了。
然後，我再誇一下酒店早餐哈，好吃且種類豐富。我每天的心情就是早上吃早晨開心，晚上玩完回到酒店又開始煩躁。

下面是槽點：
第一，我不理解w酒店這一套服務管理，我們旅遊住了很多酒店，各個酒店集團的服務各不相同，但沒有一家像w酒店這樣讓我感覺，堆了很多人來搞服務，但所以的服務都流於表面，完全不人性化。
1、你們裝修搞夜店風所以門口的門僮就要穿的像個低端酒吧的營銷嗎？
2、外賣點起來怎麼這麼麻煩，明明有外賣機器人，但一定要客人用酒店房間的座機打電話給前台，我拿一個外賣要不的自己從樓上下去要不就得打四五個電話。（這是連一個每晚300的酒店都能提供且做的很好的服務）
第二，房間設施整體老化不智能。
你們用的是什麼投屏軟件，我從未見過投屏投不上還要喊工程師來房間調整搞二十分鐘的五星級酒店，請問你們搞採購是被人騙了嗎？這軟件系統？

總之，這個住宿體驗給我的感覺就是，如果我不是想要拍照“炫富”，服務體驗就是一種浮於表面的應付感，體驗感真的蠻差的，是我住的這個價位的酒店最差的了。

首先，我要感謝Winnie，她的服務和熱情的態度讓我倍感温暖。無論是入住時的熱情接待，還是在我逗留期間的悉心照顧，Winnie都展現出了極高的職業素養和親和力。

在住宿方面，W酒店的硬件設施和軟件服務都達到了很高的水平。房間寬敞舒適，設計時尚，設施齊全。床鋪柔軟舒適，讓人一夜好眠。

在餐飲方面，W酒店的餐飲選擇豐富多樣，滿足了我不同的口味需求。早餐品種豐富，營養均衡，為我在新的一天注入了活力。

在娛樂和休閑方面，酒店提供了健身房、游泳池等設施，讓我在忙碌的行程中得以放鬆身心。此外，酒店的位置也十分便利，周邊有許多著名的景點，為我的旅行增色不少。

再次感謝Winnie和W酒店全體員工為我提供的優質服務。這次住宿體驗讓我倍感愉悦，也為我的旅行留下了美好的回憶。我相信，無論是商務出差還是休閑度假，W酒店都會是我在西安的首選之地。

msg:一個問題兩個建議：

設施問題：洗澡水時冷時熱，甚至會讓人感覺燙皮膚，這需要工程部門認真調試。

運營建議：一樓前台旁邊的酒吧晚上12點就要關門。請問酒店會不會在12點之後不讓顧客入住？即使酒店不是夜店，但是運營到凌晨一點是不是更合理一些？

設施建議：套房陽台的欄桿高度一般，如果加裝玻璃，可能給顧客的安全體驗會更好一些。建議用玻璃將陽台全部封閉起來，這樣在冬天能方便顧客更好的體驗夜景。

最後吐槽：通過攜程預訂就不能參與會員積分，原因就是攜程在價格上會優惠一些。所以現在萬豪旅享家的宗旨就是鼓勵顧客購買積分，同時也是鼓勵顧客，在同等條件下，最好不要選擇萬豪的酒店入住。

msg:各種平台，重來不給差評，所以一般基本上就是不太好的感受了。先説酒店風格，整體比較昏暗，大堂黑漆漆的。驚艷城景房，真的衹看到附近的房子。環境衞生還是比較好的，比較新。服務上細節太差，客氣之中有種傲慢，好像就是“對不起我們高端酒店就是這樣的”。定了三天，第一天入住的時候提出要安靜一些的房間，不要在走廊頂端，前台説是最高23層，給了我22樓的，衹有最後一間了。結果還是頂端的房間。第二天一早出門，下午五點多回的酒店，房間還沒打掃，客房見我們回來連忙打招呼説為了不打攪我們所以還沒打掃，這個解釋我無法理解，因為有點累就簡單讓她換了物品沒有打掃。房間太熱順便問了下客房服務空調温度為什麼調不下來，説是可以調，請維修來幫忙看，過一會兒又説維修下班了，明天來。第二天也沒人來看，衹好自己去問前台，回答“我們這裡是用地暖的，空調調不下來”，那也能開通風模式吧，結果也不行，衹能給你們房間送兩桶冰，算了沒要。第三天因為考慮到是週末想確認下退房時間，可能入住當天説過但是我不記得了，吃完早餐順便去前台問了一下，小姐姐原話記得不太清楚了，大概是説我們五星酒店還是高端酒店，都是12點退房的 好吧我第一次住五星級酒店不太瞭解😬還要吐槽一下，廁所和浴室是分開的，廁所有洗手池但是沒有肥皂洗手液之類的，每次用完需要去浴室洗手。房間衹有浴室裏面有一盒紙巾，幸好我自己帶了面巾紙。對了，高端酒店的早餐還是不錯的，當地特色的食物基本上都能嚐到，就是這個桌子搖搖晃晃的，不知道是不是高檔酒店的特色了。🤣🤣🤣坐下來的時候發現桌子底下有團紙，衹想着是沒打掃乾淨，其實那是用來墊桌底的，雖然也沒用。提出之後也沒人幫忙換餐桌，隔壁一桌吃完我自動搬家，然後這搖搖晃晃的餐桌繼續留給下一波客人……

酒店地理位置很不錯，而且還是當地的地標建築，如果有機會去西安，一定要體驗一下！
另外，酒店的服務真的是非常贊👍，因為温差的原因，老婆有點發熱，酒店不但送了口罩、體温計，還贈送了薑湯，來回還會有專人拿行李，有種賓至如歸的感覺～

msg:房間很大，硬件設施很好，為了帶老媽體驗夜店風特意選擇了W酒店。很愉快的一次入住經歷，雖然衹住了三天，留下了很多温暖的瞬間。
首先，辦理入住時前台Owen知道我是帶媽媽來旅遊，特意給升級了房間、安排了離電梯口比較近的2006房間，讓長者可以少走一些路。而且還給房間送了歡迎水果，給了旅遊地圖，加了微信説如果入住期間有任何問題可以隨時聯繫他。真的很温暖，謝謝Owen!
其次，禮賓部的小帥哥幫忙把拉桿箱送到房間後，細心的把拉桿箱放到行李架上，而且熱情的幫忙介紹房間設施，講解得清晰專業，
最後，早餐時發現一點兒小問題，Sally的處理方式真的是教科書級別的，必須點贊👍早餐廳的Sally接到同事反饋後，第一時間來到我們身邊道歉，並且給我們現切了一份水果。知道我胃不舒服沒吃什麼東西時馬上問詢要不要喝點兒鹽水，並端來了白粥和紅茶。還貼心的給打包了麪包酸奶，袋子裏還給裝了餐巾紙、濕巾、小木勺，真的很細心。而且很熱心的向我們介紹西安的旅遊景點。第三天早餐時，Sally看到老媽在座位上等我給拿餐食，馬上過來和老媽打招呼並且又給老媽拿了水果。瞭解到我們退房後要入住華清御湯酒店泡温泉的時候，還告知了長者泡温泉的注意事項，讓老媽不要泡太久。謝謝Sally!因為Sally給我的印象特別好，所以連續兩天都認真觀察她，發現她對工作投入了極大的熱情，始終微笑着、積極的為客人提供服務。她會發光發熱，讓人覺得很温暖、很舒服。這個女孩兒，未來可期！

服務是相當好的啦，有一説一比起別的酒店的品控我如果再來西安還是會選擇住w

硬件+軟件設施：房間給我們免費做了升級，硬件和軟件設施都是優+！從大唐一直到房間都特別有當代藝術的氛圍，房間裏用的洗護用品是momo的，床品也特別軟～可以説是此次西安行住的最棒的酒店了。房間也可以看到曲江，景色特別好👌🏾

服務：從進門入住到出門，小哥哥小姐姐們的服務也是沒得説，都特別熱情，而且顏值都很高！所有的問題也得到了妥善的解決。

此次特別鳴謝入住時及時幫我們解決問題的小管哥哥，還有前台退房時候幫助我們的Winnie小姐姐～

大堂非常漂亮，並且辦理入住的時候還幫忙升級了套房 每個工作人員都很友善
而且非常值得提到的是酒店的餐廳和酒吧，因為一些小事情，我表達了一點不滿意，他們的工作人員給我的態度和處理方式非常讓我滿意，甚至讓我感到愧疚😭
關於隨時/隨需，酒店在很認真地努力做到字面意義上的隨時隨需
Kiki女士的服務也很貼心，還送了西安W的行李簽！
我現在在西安麗思卡爾頓寫下這個評論，我個人認為下次來西安可以直接選擇W！（沒有必要搬來🌰）

西安W硬件就是正常的W配套，浴袍和拖鞋依舊是我的最愛。近期可能假期過了人不多了，到現場服務也很好，門僮像你親弟，每天早上還祝你出門玩的愉快 ，外賣送的也很迅速，在300客房都滿時候還人工特快😎。尤其是最近價格也不錯，性價比完勝其他城市的W。
此次特別感謝Lisa小姐姐全程服務周到，有求必應，甚至熱情出了民宿的感覺😄。

酒店坐落在西安有錢人聚集的新區，去鼓樓，灑金橋，回民街，大雁塔，大唐不夜城，陝西歷史博物館都不算很遠，打車大概20元左右。
設施：都挺新的也都好用。
衞生：我是個有點輕微潔癖的人感覺很乾凈了。
環境：酒店和客房環境都很不錯。
服務：是我住過服務最好的酒店，從進門到退房離開遇見到的每個人都很友好，員工素質都很高！

1.春節冬天期間，住了三晚，兩個晚上被熱得睡不着，最後開着陽台的門睡的，外面飄着雪，裏面蓋被子。作為西安應該是前三的酒店了，連冷氣都沒有，應急方案是讓我開着陽台的門睡。

2.早餐要排隊，西安春節旅遊熱門，我理解。問題是我們九點多才進到餐廳，服務員一會就過來通知早餐10點結束。早餐人多你們沒有應急預案，讓客人排隊吃早餐也就算了，不想着延遲早餐時間，竟然反而挨個通知10點結束？？！！咋啦，怕把你們吃垮嗎？簡直離大普。

3.整個酒店裝修夜店風格，這個沒什麼，個人喜好。但是整個大堂從白天到晚上都是昏暗的，讓人沉悶

作為酒店，最重要的兩點，吃飯和睡覺。我在這個西安前幾名的酒店裡竟然沒有一項是滿意的，合格他們都沒做到

西安非常好，下次還來。這個酒店不會再來

衞生：非常乾淨衞生，我帶小孩住的，很棒
環境：就在曲江池邊上，風景好
服務：每一位都很熱情，不管是從禮賓部還是餐廳，還是客房的服務員都很熱情周到。
已經在w住了很多很多天了，西安的麗思卡爾頓也住過，不過地理位置沒有w好。然後w的中餐晚餐不錯，spa的話，比三亞還是差點。

整個入住期間，賓客關係的Winnie女士一直非常關心我的需求，她總是能夠準確地滿足我的要求，而且總是帶着微笑和親切的笑容。
除此之外，酒店本身也給我留下了深刻的印象。房間寬敞舒適，設計現代時尚，讓我感覺很放鬆。餐廳的食物也非常美味，各種美食選擇讓我大飽口福。
總的來説，我對W酒店的入住體驗非常滿意，這也得益於司馬和Winnie的出色服務態度。我會強烈推薦這家酒店給我的朋友們，並期待着再次入住。謝謝司馬和Winnie，你們讓我的旅程更加完美！
