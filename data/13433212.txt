It has something for everyone, for our two little ones, to us adults. I enjoyed all amenities, especially the gym. It‚Äôs not a full gym, but it‚Äôs definitely hits most of the workouts I tend to do. 

My wife especially enjoyed lounging around the pool area and they balcony we had. Such a wonderful view throughout the hotel. 

I highly recommend the hotel. The only bad part of the hotel is the area where it‚Äôs located. It‚Äôs not ideal for DiDis to come, but the hotel does have a complimentary shuttle bus which is very nice. It just sits up to 6 people and we were 9! Nonetheless, it‚Äôs a great hotel and wonderful service.

msg:The hotel itself is in a good location, but the room wasnt cleaned well (stain on sofa, table wasnt wiped). The bathroom facilities were clean, though. 
During my two night stay at around 11:30 pm, there were guests yelling and running on the floor outside, banging doors. 
We happened to be caught by a typhoon, and the way staff handled this situation is why I would not recommend the hotel:
First, a bunch of guests tried to get to the airport, but nobody could get a didi due to roads being blocked. However, cars were still dropping people off and we got lucky to catch a driver to the airport. We had asked whether the hotel could organize a bus or van to help several guests get to the airport at once, but they declined and it was a everyone fend for yourself situation. Some help would have been greatly appreciated.
Also, because we were stranded for a while, we went to the hotel restaurant, that then sent us away saying they had no food. However, only 10% of the tables were taken. We managed to get rice and vegetables in the end.

The mattress on the one single bed was caving in and the staff turned the mattress around. After their first night, they asked to change rooms and they found a room that was a little better but was still damp smelling. The rooms need better ventilation especially with the price you pay for a room.

The shower room on Floor 2 needs to be cleaned more regularly as it smells. There should be a hook to hang your towel/belongings, however the water pressure is amazing.

Food; the breakfast was okay, not so much variety especially for western food. 
The hotel is located around 2.5km from Dadonghai beach  (12RMB didi ride). The hotel surroundings are just basic with nothing much to offer. Opposite the hotel is a fire station and behind the fire station you can see yachts and boats. 
The hotel itself has quite a lot of activities to do especially for kids.

msg:Overall we enjoyed our stay at the Wingate hotel. We found the staff to be helpful and friendly. We want to specifically mention and thank Elene at Reception who provided excellent service and assistance throughout our stay. We stayed on the 6th floor in a Deluxe Harbour View Suite. The room was spacious and clean. There is a bedroom, small sitting room area, a large bathroom with a bath and shower and a balcony with a table & two chairs. We had a lovely view of the yacht club from the balcony. There were two televisions in the room. One in the sitting room area and one in the bedroom. There are also two small sofa beds. One in the bedroom and one in the sitting room area. There is a small walk-in closet where we were able to keep our clothes and travel luggage. The room had a dehumidifier which was helpful at this time of the year when the humidity is high. The hotel offers a laundromat for the guests to use. At the time of our stay, it cost 20rmb for a wash and 20rmb to dry. The washing liquid is supplied by the hotel. You do not pay extra to use it. The hotel is great for families with kids. It has 3 pool options, a water slide and an outdoor and indoor kids play area. There is a gym which has a couple of treadmills and some weight-bearing equipment. We found it to be clean whenever we used it. The buffet breakfast was quite substantial in terms of choice although the fare is not varied much from day to day. At the time of our stay, the only eggs you could get were fried or boiled. On the plus side, the buffet breakfast is available until 1:30 pm each day. If you are a coffee lover though, we do not recommend the coffee in the breakfast restaurant. It was constantly bitter and tasted burnt. Although there was a barista machine in the restaurant it was not operational. You can order a la carte for dinner although it should be noted that the fare is all Chinese as far as we could tell. The restaurant is open from 5:30 pm. There is also a Chinese-style barbecue restaurant on the 1st floor. If you are a foreigner and looking for Western food options in the area, The Dolphin restaurant is a 5-10 minute taxi ride away. It offers pasta, burgers, pizzas, etc. There is also Pizza hut and Macdonalds in the same area. The hotel offers free shuttle buses to various Sanya attractions. We took the one to the Haitang duty-free mall. The travel duration was an hour and fifteen minutes. There are 4 departure times a day. If you are a foreigner remember to take your passport and travel itinerary with you should you chose to go to any of the duty-free malls. Would we stay at this hotel again? Yes, IF the hotel sorted out their coffee catastrophe :).

The second night we stayed here, there was a foul smell from the bathroom that made the entire room smell very bad. The staff explained to my wife who can speak Chinese that the toilet had a crack and they had to seal it. The next night my wife and I could smell smoke in the room. My wife immediately called the hotel staff early about 6AM but they fought with her over the phone saying they didn't believe her since our room is suppose to be non-smoking. So staff came up to our room early in the morning to investigate since they thought my wife was lying to them. They claimed they didn't smell smoke. The hotel service desk said the manager was not here and went back to Shandong. So they refused any sort of compensation for the room or to give us free breakfast for the rest of our stay. The service is so poor at this hotel and the manager is not even here. This is suppose to be a 5 star hotel but service is 1 star or less.

Rooms~ Spacious and clean
Breakfast ~ Nice variety: western & chinese options
Pool~ Situated in the middle of the hotel with
different sections to accomodate the kiddies too. 
Reception~ Friendly, helpful and professional
Taxi airport to hotel~ Cost was aboutÔø•60

One thing is that I could not book any day tours as a foreigner with the onsite tour operator. 
Plan B: Eason at reception was excellent and did his best to assist. Providing information and locations for the places I wanted to visit. His professionalism and friendliness was a breath of fresh air. 

I will surely book this hotel again!

The card is inserted all day and the air conditioner is on. No matter what the guests check out and come in, they are cool and happy. It is so comfortable that I don't want to leave the hotel and go out to play hahaha. This time I booked a lakeside room. Last time I booked the third floor. I envy others who can open the door to the swimming pool without going up and down the elevator, so this time I also experience it. It is very convenient to open the door to swim, and it is more convenient to go to the restaurant. The buffet is very fresh. After checking out, the after-sales service of the duty manager who helped to open the water bill was also very gentle, polite and considerate. I will stay here again when I come to Sanya next time.

msg:As someone who never gives negative reviews, I want to complain. . . Before checking in, I read some bad reviews on Xiaohongshu, and I thought that a five-star rating would make it worse, but Xiaohongshu is really sincere and doesn‚Äôt deceive meüíî
question:
1. The toilet and shower sewer in the hotel bathroom have a serious odor. After staying for two days, I could only open the balcony door during the day to diffuse the smell, and I dared to close it at night to sleep. However, the ventilation fan in the bathroom could not be turned off, otherwise I would have to hold my breath when going to the bathroom at night.
2. The hotel facilities can be old or dirty, but I don‚Äôt understand them if they are dirty. The sofa, under the bed and chairs were in a state that could not be cleaned.
It really doesn't deserve five stars, not even 500 or 600 in the off-season, let alone 1,700 in the peak season. I have never stayed in an Orange Hotel so poorly. Instead of booking it, it‚Äôs better to book a quick hotel. Maybe there is no swimming pool.
There is probably nothing that can be done to save this hotel other than renovating it.
3. Finally, let‚Äôs talk about the bay. The bay corresponding to the hotel side belongs to the boat harbor. It is very noisy and has no aesthetic feeling. The location is unnecessary and the most beautiful pictures can be taken. . . The entrance to the hotel is also quite chaotic, and it feels dangerous to go out without taking a taxi.
4. At the end of the check-out, the hotel is also very ink-stained. If you want to get a business card, you need to give a five-star review and then give a gift. I felt embarrassed to refuse others, but I still made up my mind to say no and returned the gift. If it's good, I'll definitely give it a thumbs up, but if it's not, it will embarrass my society.

The room I was given was on the inside and was relatively quiet. Snacks will be given. No own beach. I had dustpan rice from the hotel for dinner. The taste is bland. Overall it's okay.

The front desk FO manager actively provided help and had strong problem-solving ability, which made the stay experience in the following nights very pleasant. Xiao Pingping, who cleaned the room, was meticulous and thoughtful, and the towel folding animals were of course loved by the children! Although the constant temperature bathing pool is small, it is also a water park for children to play in, and they swim happily every day. In short, if there is no construction, it is highly recommended to stay.

You can go to the hotel for processing after buying it yourself without being ripped off. Besides, the hotel service is very good. The lady at the front desk answers all your questions and does the cleaning. The cleaning aunt is also very responsible. We spent seven days in Sanya city. We stayed in this hotel for a total of seven days with four orders. We kept renewing our stay. It is highly recommended.

The hotel has complete facilities, such as buffet breakfast, adult swimming pool, gym, fish spa pool, children's playground, etc. Everything is available, and the price-performance ratio is really high. I like the buffet breakfast here the most. There are really many types, including Chinese and Western styles, including pasta, grilled sausages, snacks, fruits, fried noodles, steamed buns... and the breakfast is Until 12 o'clock, there is no need to rush for breakfast. Swimming in the adult pool in the afternoon was very relaxing. Let's talk about the guest rooms. I feel that they are very clean. The decoration style is simple and comfortable. They have a small refrigerator, a TV, an independent bathroom, and a balcony. When you open the balcony window, you can see greenery everywhere and the air is very good. I wanted to go to Luhuitou Scenic Area temporarily, so I made a reservation with the front desk. The hotel actually has a free bus to reach it. I like it manually! This trip to Sanya was a pretty good experience~

The environment is really good, the room is spacious, and there is a small tent for children to play in. I loved it as soon as I entered the room. The double bed was two meters long. It was very comfortable and super soft. It was very refreshing after a night's sleep. The water in the shower room was very strong and it was very comfortable to take a bath. All in all, the room was very nice. We stayed there the next day. Tianyu Hotel, once you enter the room in the first area, you really can't check in. It's the same as the express hotel. Later, you paid extra to change to the second area. It can only be said that it is better than the first area, but the room is still not as good as Wyndham. The parent-child suites are all about the same price. Needless to say, I stayed in Atlantis for the last two days. This hotel is very high-end and cost-effective. Choose Wyndham. If you don‚Äôt have a problem with the money, choose Atlantis.

In particular, their bedding and pillows are very good and it is very comfortable to sleep. The water pressure of the bathroom faucet is very comfortable, and the toiletries are also branded.

I chose this one and was pleasantly surprised. The front desk service was very good and patient. The complimentary services provided by the hotel during check-in were clearly explained. The room staff were also very friendly and basically responded to all requests. The hotel is located in the middle of the mountain, so it is indeed much more convenient to travel by car. However, the hotel also provides free buses to the beach and the city center. Taking a taxi by yourself only costs 10 yuan. We ate at the hotel restaurant in the evening and ate the special Hainan dustpan. The rice and vinegar hot pot costs less than 100 yuan per person, which I personally think is a great value.

Meals: The breakfast food is relatively rich, and the best thing is that breakfast time is until 12:00, which is great!

The TV system should be upgraded to a larger smart TV for a better experience; Wyndham members hope that breakfast can also be delivered; in addition, there are relatively few seafood meals for breakfast; and it is hoped that a mini bar can be introduced.

Take a taxi and go directly to the hotel lobby, which is on the 5th floor and is open.
There was no discount given at midnight, but the total price was still a good deal.
The room was a surprise, with a 2-meter large bed, a separate bathroom, very spacious, and a balcony.
The mattress is very comfortable and the toiletries in the bathroom are also exquisite.
I stayed for 2 days and there was a thunderstorm on the second day. The room was very well soundproofed and I didn‚Äôt even hear the rain outside while I was lying in the room.
The fly in the oin**ent is that I found a bug crawling on the bed at night. I was so scared that I quickly grabbed it to death. It is true that bugs are difficult to avoid in a hot and humid place like Sanya. I hope the hotel can be cleaner in this area.

msg:I sincerely advise you not to stay at the Wyndham in Sanya. There are huge problems 1. The design of the bathroom feels like there is no privacy at all. You can still see the inside after closing the door (Picture 1) 2. In the shower room I don‚Äôt know why it smelled like sulfur~ When I turned on the nozzle later, I was speechless and even the water smelled like sulfur. 3. This hotel doesn‚Äôt even have a concierge. 4. The service is non-existent. After staying for two hours, I decided not to stay and just changed to another hotel!

Located on the sea road in the south of Dadonghai, the transportation is convenient. There is a fishing village farmer's market not far from the hotel. If you want to eat seafood, buy it back and process it in the hotel. Fried ice and Hou'an noodles are available in everything, and convenience stores, milk tea shops, and snack bars can be seen everywhere, making it difficult to choose.

The decoration style of the hotel is mainly simple and fashionable, which is the style that young people like. The lobby and every corner of the hotel are pop-style. The bold and avant-garde decoration makes people's eyes shine. The rooms are simple and clean. A very comfortable feeling.

The facilities in the hotel are quite complete. You can not only enjoy the buffet breakfast at the Bi‚Äôan restaurant, but also lunch and dinner here.

msg:When we checked in, the front desk told us to help us upgrade the room type, saying that the room we booked was relatively small and had no balcony. Seeing that we had children, they helped us upgrade to a larger mountain view room with a balcony. The green mountain view is very comfortable . The service at this price is comparable to five-star hotels in various bays. The hotel also has a butler, who can solve problems in a timely manner. I asked if there is anything interesting nearby. I recommend us to go to the nearby Luhuitou Scenic Area. Free tickets , It costs more than 10 yuan to take a taxi, and it takes more than an hour to go up and down the mountain. After a little exercise, you can also see the city view and sea view. It is best to go in the evening. We went in the evening. Planted, not exposed to the sun, very comfortable, and the view is also very good. The children also had a great time playing in the hotel. The sanitation is quite clean. In terms of facilities, I personally like them very much. The colors are bright and the color matching in the room is very comfortable. Although the hotel is small, it has everything, especially the children's playground, which is enough for children to play for a long time .
In addition, the location of the hotel is actually quite good. There is a fishing village community nearby. There are many local snacks. It is very lively at night. There is a small market next to it where you can buy seafood for processing, so you don't have to run any locomotives. The yacht pier has a panoramic view, and it is so convenient to go to sea. In the evening, we ate Hainan‚Äôs characteristic dross vinegar hot pot in the hotel restaurant. The sweet and sour taste is quite delicious, and the price is affordable. I love it~~

Hygiene: Among the several hotels during this trip to Sanya, the only room has no peculiar smell, no musty smell, and it is clean.
Environment: The hotel faces the sea and is backed by mountains. I live comfortably as I like cleanliness.
Service: The check-in at the front desk is fast, and the front desk manager is also very good. When we continue to stay, he will help us with the check-in. Like it üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª. On the third day during the stay, the customer service service was so busy cleaning that it was only after 2 pm, which was the only time it was late. The waiter was new, and the towels in the room were collected, but they were not filled. Later, I called the front desk and immediately solve.
Checking out is also very convenient, hand the room card to the front desk, and it will be OK without waiting for the ward round. Like it üëçüèªüëçüèª.
The biggest highlight is that the hotel room has a room card inserted, no matter how hot it is outside, the room will be cool when you come back.
Disadvantages: The breakfast is not exquisite enough, and the juice is not freshly squeezed. Coffee is good. Personally, I don't need so many dishes, but they should be refined. The cracks in the door of the room can be soundproofed, the corridor is too noisy at night when wearing slippers. Bathroom toiletries, especially toothbrushes, shed hair and were too hard. The body lotion is pretty good.
The fourth trip to Sanya is over, I hope to maintain the consistent service and quality, and look forward to my next stay.
Give the little brother at the front desk and the front desk as much as possible. There is also the concierge brother at the door, who helped me carry the suitcase and put it in the trunk. grateful!!!

The hotel style is very young and modern, because I came to Sanya Several times, I have stayed in a beach hotel by the sea. I saw this hotel on the Internet by accident. At the beginning, I just thought that the room was relatively new. I wanted to try to stay for one night. At the beginning, I only booked for one night. After checking in, I found out It‚Äôs really beyond imagination. In addition to the new hotel rooms, there are quite a lot of other entertainment facilities. There are swimming pools, fish spa pools, jacuzzi pools, and gyms. I didn‚Äôt expect that a hotel worth a few hundred dollars can experience so many items. , what I like most is their breakfast, which is really suitable for us night owls, you can sleep late, breakfast is open until 1 noon
At 2:00, wake up, this meal can be served as breakfast or Chinese food, which saves the money for Chinese food. If you want to go to the beach, it takes about 10 minutes by car. Fortunately, the hotel provides a special car to the beach. Make an appoin**ent in advance at the front desk when you check in , Inquiring about local delicious food and fun places, they responded enthusiastically to us. I was too lazy to go out at night and accidentally saw the grilled fish in the advertisement. I went to try it. It was delicious beyond expectations. Meal, praise praise praise. . . .

Only 45 minutes to the airport and 30 minutes to the train station
The key is only 200+ per capita, which is really cost-effective

‚úîThe location of the hotel won my heart
The hotel is on the South Sea Road, surrounded by fishing village farmer‚Äôs market, if you want to eat seafood, you can buy it back to the hotel for processing; there is also a fishing village, which brings together a variety of local delicacies and snacks, such as fishing village fried chicken, Qingbuliang, Hou‚Äôan powder, etc.; It‚Äôs not far from the Dadonghai Sea. Go to the beach to watch the sunset and find a tavern for a drink. The nearby free attractions are Xiaozhou Island Park, where you can catch the sea and dig snails. If you want to overlook the beautiful scenery of Sanya, you might as well go to Luhuitou Park , the natural oxygen bar is suitable for hiking, and you can also meet monkeys on the mountain.
-
‚úî The decoration of the hotel is bold and novel
The overall style of the lobby gives people a grand and high-end feeling, and the guest rooms are in a young and fashionable style. This time I came to Sanya and chose the Bay Suite. It is really pleasant to sit on the balcony at night and watch the night view of the bay opposite.
-
Whether it's business trip, tourism, or honeymoon, this hotel is a good choice. Going out is actually the pursuit of comfort and cost-effectiveness. It just so happens that this hotel meets all of them, and there are so many surrounding projects that you won't feel bored on vacation.

The restaurant also has a children's dining area and a children's entertainment area. The swimming laps in the swimming pool are also free to use. Breakfast can also be eaten until 12 o'clock, which is very suitable for people who sleep late and mothers and fathers. Children under the age of 8 do not need to pay for breakfast. My family is 3 years old and 6 years old. Before staying in other hotels, breakfast is charged according to height. It takes a lot of extra expenses, and this one saves the whole house. The room type has been upgraded. You can see the whole view of the hotel from the room, and you can also see the yacht from the balcony. The hotel is very close to the yacht marina. The next day I went out to sea with my friends and family. It took 5 minutes by taxi to arrive at the marina. When I took a yacht to the sea, I passed in front of the hotel. It is recommended to come to Sanya to play. You must pack a yacht to go out to sea. Both adults and children had fun that day, which was much easier than running the scenic spot. We also went to Dadonghai Beach, and the hotel butler reserved a hotel free bus for us. The 2 children played on the beach until they were unwilling to leave. After returning to the hotel, they played on the hotel's artificial beach for an hour, and fell asleep in seconds at night. It is recommended to stay. By the way, the poolside of the hotel is a good place for afternoon tea. The amount of 128 yuan can't be eaten by the whole family. The cool breeze and the children's joyous noises by the poolside are very pleasant. . . .

For dinner, the family had a grilled fish set meal at the hotel. The price of 298 yuan per set for hotel guests can be said to be quite a conscientious price. It is cost-effective and convenient. The service brother is also polite and enthusiastic. . .
The end time of breakfast is really my favorite. Last night I went to the beach to catch the sea and came back late. I slept until I woke up naturally at 11 o'clock. I can have breakfast leisurely. It is very rich. I really like that mango yogurt. Announcing The powder is worth a try, and children love the cute bread very much. . .

The starting price of a taxi is 11 yuan (dididi is cheaper). The convenience of the area is also relatively quiet if it is not in the urban area. It is a quiet place in the middle of the bustle. If you want to go out to play, then living here is a good choice. Luhuitou is a scenic spot that does not cost money, and it is also possible to go to the top to watch a sunset that does not cost money.
[Hotel facilities]: The hotel is not big, but as a resort hotel, there should be adult swimming pools, children's swimming pools, indoor and outdoor children's clubs, and gymnasiums. Professional photographers are also provided to take pictures when checking in, and there are also buses to duty-free shops. Key hotels It is also equipped with a fish therapy pool and a constant temperature bubble pool that are not available in other hotels. Although the sparrow is small and complete, the overall children's supporting facilities may be more suitable for children aged 1-8. Children's swimming rings are also free. It is probably also the reason why this hotel sets breakfast for children under 8 years old for free.
[Hotel Services] There is a dedicated porter at the entrance of the lobby. The service is also very warm and discerning. He can take the initiative to help deliver the luggage when we come. The front desk is very patient at check-in. The hotel's supporting facilities, business hours, and places to eat and play around are also introduced. According to the recommendation of the front desk, we went to the fishing village near the hotel and ate fried ice with durian and avocado. It was really good and recommended.
The breakfast at the hotel is until 12 o'clock, which is really happy for us who are late for the flight. .

msg:We booked a three-night room on Ctrip and paid cash for the three-day stay at the hotel. Later, because we had to change our itinerary, we contacted Ctrip and wanted to cancel the third day‚Äôs stay. Ctrip‚Äôs customer service said that after negotiating with the hotel, we could check out and refund the third day. After thinking about the day's fee, I decided not to refund it and continued to stay. We returned to the hotel around 11:30 pm on the second day and told the lady at the front desk about the situation. We canceled the early check-out. The lady also said that we could delete the note and we all agreed. Don't worry. The hotel front desk called us at 1:30 noon on the third day and asked if we needed to extend our stay. I said that we had originally booked three days. The early check-out mentioned before had been informed to the front desk last night. Then the front desk guy said that if In such a situation, I need to pay the difference. I didn‚Äôt ask how much. Looking at the price, it should be about 300. Of course I am not willing to pay the difference. I paid for three days of room on the day I checked in. Even if I wanted to check out early, I gave one day‚Äôs notice. You didn't tell me that I needed to pay the difference. If I informed the situation, I could choose to check out or pay the difference. Now it's definitely not possible to ask me to pay the difference. The front desk did not fulfill its obligation to inform and blamed me for personal reasons. Do you think I will be resentful if I am asked to pay the price difference? I have always held the attitude that if I want to stay, I must pay the price difference. I also told him that I originally wanted to extend my stay for how many days, but he also asked me how many more days? At least how many days? That is, it depends on how many days I renew it and then consider whether the price difference can be waived? Such a big hotel is so small? Haha, you are responsible for the front desk's responsibility. If you call me later, you won't have to pay the price difference. I will be given a room discount later. I did not choose to extend my stay. I can check out as soon as 2:00. End

After checking in, he watched me bring the children and took the initiative to send the luggage to the room. The room service staff is sincere and patient. Because they have children, they always call to deliver things, and the customer service staff always deliver them on time without any emotion. The hotel is not by the sea, but the hotel itself has many facilities, such as swimming pool, gym, children's indoor playground, fish therapy pool, massage pool, and there is an artificial sand dredging pool next to the children's pool. Sand dredging tools are provided free of charge, which is the favorite of babies. The swimming pool is open until 11:00 p.m., and the swimming pool is free for hotel guests, which is much better than other hotels. Although the money is not much, the feeling is completely different. There is also a music bubble show at 7 pm every day, so you can have fun without leaving the hotel. The hotel's breakfast is open until 12 o'clock. When we checked out, the front desk gave us frozen mineral water for us to drink on the way. It was really considerate. I will choose your home next time I stay.

When I checked in, the lady at the front desk saw that I was taking care of the children, and she took the initiative to prepare children's toiletries for me. I like this service. When introducing the hotel facilities and the surrounding area, I learned that the hotel‚Äôs breakfast is open until 12 o‚Äôclock, and children under the age of 8 have free breakfast. I decisively ordered 2 breakfasts, one day in advance, and the price is still discounted. It‚Äôs 88 yuan per person, which is a very conscientious price. . The hotel restaurant has a children's meal pick-up area. My sister doesn't like to eat. Seeing these cute cakes, I keep clamoring to eat them and eat them myself. I highly recommend their home-made Hainan noodles, which should be served with Hainan-style yellow bell peppers. Anyway, I ate 2 bowls. There are also many facilities for children to play in the hotel park. My sister likes the indoor children's playground the most. My sister likes the water slide in the children's pool the most. My favorite is their fish therapy pool. If you are ticklish, don't challenge it. The free travel photo is useless this time, come again next time.

msg:I really admire my vision in choosing a hotel, it is a treasure hotel!
Kudos to Xiao Zhu at the front desk, he gave us a free upgrade to the bay room when we checked in, and sometimes helped us find things we left behind üëç I saw bad reviews from Ctrip before checking in. Some said that the hygiene and bedding were not good, but there was nothing at all. Don't worry. ! When I left, I saw a table full of trophies in the hotel lobby. They are all the best hotels every year. I will choose them again when I come to Sanya next time.

Facilities: very new and perfect! The bed is super sleepy, the bedding is hygienic and soft, and the room is equipped with irons, umbrellas, etc. There are swimming pools, bubble baths, fish spas, gyms, and children's playgrounds. Robots deliver things. In short, it is very humane

Hygiene: fully up to the standard, instant cleaning, clean and soft towels, will not feel corroded and hardened by disinfectant water, and there are almost no hygienic dead ends

Environment: Quiet quiet quiet! I don‚Äôt like the noise of the urban area when I go on vacation, and I don‚Äôt want to be too far away. This place perfectly meets my requirements. There are also many takeaways around. There is a snack street within 10 minutes of walking.

Service: Nothing to say, great! Praise Xiao Zhu at the front desk, thank you~

msg:The hotel is located in Dadonghai, at the foot of Luhuitou Mountain, between Sanya Bay and Yalong Bay. Except for Luhuitou, you need to take a taxi. It takes about an hour to Wuzhizhou Island and Water World, and it takes about the same time to go to Nanshan. The external facilities of the hotel feel average, but the room is very satisfactory, the area is large, relatively new and clean. Ordering takeout is very convenient and the price is very affordable. If you need to visit various attractions, it is a relatively central location. If you only spend time in the sea and hotels, Yalong Bay and Haitang Bay are more convenient, and of course the consumption is higher.

Friends who travel can choose this hotel. The hotel is in the city center and the transportation is very convenient. The surrounding environment is also great! The nearby tourist destinations can be reached in minutes. The room is clean and tidy without any peculiar smell, and there is a light fragrance that is very reassuring. The big bed is very soft and comfortable. After a tiring day, you can get a good rest. You can also follow the large floor-to-ceiling windows in the hotel room, and the sunlight shines into the room I feel that the lighting in the whole room is great, and the photos in the room are also very good! To be honest, I really like the design of the room, and I also experience the enthusiasm of little brother Cai Jibin! She kindly gave us a fruit plate!

msg:Stayed for four nights before the Spring Festival and researched many hotels. This is the one with the highest overall cost performance.

Let me talk about the disadvantages first:
1. The location of the hotel is relatively hidden, it is slightly difficult to take a taxi, and the road is relatively winding.
2. The room is relatively small.
3. After 5:30 in the morning, there is a little ambient noise, buzzing, not sure if it is from the hotel equipment or the yacht port. The first night was more mindful, but I got used to it later.
4. The hotel is not near the beach, so you need to take a taxi. Including shopping, eating, and taking a taxi.

There are many advantages:
1. International chain, with basic guarantees in all aspects of quality, such as service and hygiene. (Weijing Wyndham is a reduced version of Wyndham)
2. The hotel facilities are very complete, with everything you need, and a little fun. Small but complete.
3. The breakfast is very delicious and top-notch.
4. The hotel is relatively new, the decoration is modern, and the lighting has scene control.
5. The mattress is very comfortable, first-line standard, and you can sleep well. Looked at Simmons.
6. The hotel is near the Luhuitou Scenic Area. Another benefit of being remote is that there is no road noise, and the birds chirp in the morning.

The details of hygiene are slightly reduced. There is visible garbage on the glass outside the window of the elevator hall on the 6th floor. There are sanitation omissions in the room. There was waste paper on the balcony when we checked in, and it was not processed the next day.

msg:Let me talk about the conclusion first: surprise, treasure hotel
Travel background: This time I came to Sanya as a family of five, four days and three nights, staying in a hotel in Sanya Bay for one night, and staying in this Wyndham for two nights.
Room price: The next two nights were originally booked for the Mid-Levels Intercontinental Executive Room one week in advance. After reading Ctrip's reviews, I canceled the reservation after comprehensive consideration. This Wyndham was only booked on Ctrip on the afternoon of the day of check-in. The price of the Bay Suite with two breakfasts was really a surprise.
Room facilities: The Bay Suite is really great, the view from the window is great, the interior decoration and facilities in the room are no exaggeration to say that there are many luxury hotels in the range of 1500-2000. It can be seen that the maintenance and cleaning of the decoration facilities in the room are also adequate and appropriate, and it looks like a newly opened hotel.
Hotel facilities: The breakfast was excellent, with a good variety on both mornings, and it changed every day. There are many children, and they all have fun in the children's heated swimming pool. There are many award certificates of parent-child hotels in the hotel lobby.
Hotel location: The reason why the price of the hotel is very close to the people may be that it is not near the seaside. Many foreign tourists may directly ignore this hotel when searching. The underground parking lot is large and convenient to park. The hotel drove to the Intercontinental Xiaodonghai beach for 5 minutes. The last photo was of Xiaodonghai. The photo was beautiful. It can capture the feeling of the glass sea. It took 9 minutes to drive to the Dadonghai beach. No traffic jams. Pro-test KFC and McDonald's takeaway can be delivered.
Check-in experience: The bathtub is super large and comfortable, and I soaked it 3 times in two days. The surrounding environment is very quiet at night, and the quality of sleep for two nights is not bad.
One downside: You can order your own meals for lunch and dinner in the hotel restaurant. I ate a set meal of 598, and the discounted price is 398 for hotel guests. How should I put it, the senses and taste of the dishes can only be said to be quite satisfactory, and they are not exquisite. It is recommended to delve into the dishes, especially these set meals are the most ordered by guests. If it can give foreign tourists the vision of eating Hainan specialties And the taste bud shock is perfect. The service of the restaurant staff is really good and great, a big thumbs up.
After writing so much, the main reason is that this hotel brought us the biggest surprise of our trip to Sanya. I am glad that I refunded the 1800-night Intercontinental, and I am happy.

Sister Man's Qingbuliang is delicious. Hainan Coconut Chicken Restaurant is a few blocks away from the chain store Coconut Chicken. The location of the hotel is at the foot of Luhuitou Mountain, a quiet location amidst the noise. If the front desk is not mistaken, it should be called Carry, she is very enthusiastic and nice. Disadvantages: The poolside room does not get any sunlight at all, it is very damp and smelly, although there is a dehumidifier, it is useless. The service staff needs to be trained, and they basically don't take the initiative to greet guests, and they don't like to answer questions in detail. In this hotel, except for the front desk and the guards who go out, I feel enthusiastic, and the others can only be said to be less trained:). The hotel swimming pool is not heated and will be a little cold. I hope your hotel will get better and better

1. The location of the hotel won my heart:
The hotel is very close to the Yacht Wharf Cruise Center. It takes 5 minutes by car. It is convenient to go out to sea. It is a 10-minute walk from Nanbian Hai Fishing Village. It is very convenient to eat local specialties at night. Behind the hotel is Luhuitou Forest Park. The hotel has a free bus to go there, 5 minutes away Yes, this is the best place in Sanya to watch the sunset, and you can also see the panorama of Sanya, and the key scenic spots are free. The hotel has free parking. Parking is super convenient.
2. The price/performance ratio of the room is really high:
The room is very spacious, the layout is clean and warm, the bathroom is separated from the wet and dry, and the hot water is available when it is turned on. The buffet breakfast is also very good, with everything from Chinese and Western styles, and the supply time is also very long, meeting the different needs of guests.
3. The service is very good:
Help push the luggage, press the elevator, the front desk is very considerate, and will take the initiative to ask if you have other needs. If something is missing, a robot will deliver it to your door, and the robot is so cute~
4. Complete facilities:
There are gyms, swimming pools, bubble pools, Yuliao ponds, and kids clubs. The key point is that the Yuliao pool has a constant temperature in winter. It is very comfortable to go to the bubble pool after playing!
Now staying in the hotel, there is also a free ticket to the Yanoda Scenic Spot, which can be used until the end of June. It is very good and recommended.

After comparing several hotels, I finally chose the Wyndham Hotel, which costs more than 600 yuan. It is quite cost-effective in Sanya during the peak season! The little brother at the front desk has a very good service attitude, very enthusiastic and kind, check-in is very fast and skilled. The corridors of the hotel are cleaned very cleanly. The logo is concise and clear. The first feeling when entering the room is that the room is big, clean, and very warm. There is no musty smell or humidity, which means that the ventilation effect is good. The bedding is clean and tidy, and it is really hygienic. Nothing to say. I wandered around the hotel during the day. This is really a small but well-equipped hotel. There are 5 swimming pools in the hotel, including Yuliao Pool, Jacuzzi Pool, and the children‚Äôs pool, which are at constant temperature. This is very friendly to children. ah! There are indoor and outdoor children's playgrounds. There are two cute little rabbits and a sand pool at the entrance of the children's playground. There are quite a lot of children playing! Really the only downside is that it is no longer at the seaside. My friend said that at the seaside, it is estimated that we will not be able to book 600! At noon, my classmates came over and ordered a new set meal of the dross vinegar hot pot in the restaurant. After eating, everyone said that if they come to Hainan to eat hot pot, they will eat dross vinegar! A hotel worth staying in again.

I really don‚Äôt know how so many good reviews come from: 1. Location It's very remote, the surroundings are dark at night, and you have to go a long way to eat. If you don't drive by yourself, it's extremely inconvenient; 2. For such a remote and expensive star hotel, it stands to reason that the hotel facilities and rooms should be good. But in fact, the hotel's overall supporting facilities can only be described as very general, and it doesn't look like a star-rated hotel. Whether it is a deluxe room or a superior room, the windows face a very close hill, and the view from the window is particularly depressing; 3. The room is not as big as the description, and the double bed made of two double beds occupies the entire room. People feel extremely depressed; 4. The quality of the supplies in the room is very poor. There are rust spots on the bottom of the kettle when you open it, and you immediately lose the desire to drink water; 5. There is no sense of service. There is at most one waiter in the lobby. No matter what you are moving or what you are doing, no one cares about it and turns a blind eye; 6. The breakfast dishes are very average, but the charges are very aggressive. There are only children over five years old. Take the child to measure his height. This is the only time I have come to Hainan. It's not that I can't afford a meal, it's really uncomfortable and speechless. I have never written such a long review, and I have not paid for photos, but in order to avoid more people falling into the trap, I made time to write the real situation

It is recommended that you choose this hotel carefully, because it faces the port, the fire station, and the main road. Especially the bay suite, it's really noisy! Alarm sounds, car sounds, sounds in your ears!
The supporting facilities of the parent-child park are also aging and dilapidated... It is not a parent-child hotel!
The room facilities are not bad, especially the mattress is not bad! But the air conditioner was not cooling, so I didn't sleep well at night! The key response was given to the hotel, but no one responded! Stay for one night and change hotels quickly!

He even told me that Luhuitou is not open, not open. , so there is no shuttle bus, confirm with him (a boy) again and again, are you sure? He answered with certainty. I said that Luhuitou was not open. After I got to the room, I contacted the scenic spot and found that Luhuitou was already open, and then informed the front desk. The front desk just said that I had not received a notice to open. ü•≤This hotel is just chatting with Luhuitou, and it is drunk if you can't confirm this basic information to tourists.

But one thing happened today that made me super dissatisfied. I stayed in this hotel basically every month. Today, my aunt came to clean the room. I saw that the mop was not cleaned or was gray. Then I told my aunt to wash the mop again and then mop it. Auntie said she was washed. I don't want to fight anymore. I squeezed the shower gel myself and dragged it myself. After mopping, ask my aunt if there are other mopping cloths and I will mop it up. The aunt said impatiently. Then take a picture of the ground with the phone. Not long after the photo was taken, another cleaning aunt also came over, stuck her head out to look at the room and left. Then the cleaning aunt was muttering to him when she went out to get something from the door. Very dissatisfied! Why do you talk so much about your job? ? You can't clean yourself. I procrastinate. Do you think that all I drag is water to mumble with other cleaning aunties? Why do you like to chat so much at work? ? ? You think that all I drag is water, so why don't you drag yourself? I don't have to mop as soon as you clean the mop? After I dragged you, you thought that all I dragged was water. At the door of the room, I talked with my colleagues about the guests in this room! As if I don't exist anymore?

There are not many hotels in Haitang Bay that can do it (if you don't believe me, you can read the guest reviews of other hotels at will). The hotel's room is looking at the yacht harbor from the side, it's a little regretful that we can't see the whole view of the harbor. The price of the hotel's restaurant package is even cheaper than the price of the restaurant outside. The hotel can also arrange a car to send the guests to the seafood market to buy seafood back to the hotel for processing. The male waiter at the front desk is also very kind and warm. This hotel should be my first choice for cost-effective hotels in Sanya!

msg:The hotel is located in a quiet place in a busy city. But I was a little surprised that the lobby is on the fifth floor. First of all, let's talk about the traffic problem. We rented a car and drove there. Thinking that it would be convenient to go upstairs, we asked if there was an underground parking lot, but we never expected that the underground parking lot was not as convenient as parking at the hotel lobby. Entering from the parking entrance, there is an uphill slope on the left and a downhill slope on the right. In fact, after going uphill, you can drive to the outside of the hotel lobby on the fifth floor, so that the staff can help take the luggage and deliver the luggage. We parked underground and had to take it by ourselves. However, as long as you are a hotel guest, no parking fee will be charged, whether it is above ground or underground. Second, I think this is an underestimated hotel. There is nothing to criticize about the room layout, facilities, service attitude... The hotel's flaw may be that there is no beach in Sanya. However, we played with sand almost every day in the past few days, and we didn't have an obsession with the beach, so we didn't think it was wrong. But don't worry about bringing children here. There is a large play area on the third floor (the lobby is on the fifth floor), both indoors and outdoors. There is a small constant temperature massage pool, a swimming pool (both outdoor), and a fish therapy pool. There is an indoor playground for children, and there are all kinds of small cars that can be pedaled outdoors, including three-wheeled and four-wheeled cars, large and small. My eldest child, who is about 1.6 meters tall, also has a four-wheeled car to ride. There is also a small sand pit. Children will not get tired of playing all day. After talking about the advantages, let's talk about the areas that need improvement. 1. The hotel facilities say that there is a constant temperature swimming pool, but it is actually just a massage pool. It is impossible to use it for swimming. The water depth is 80cm, which is OK for babies to paddle. The real swimming pool is still too cold. During the Spring Festival when the temperature is over 20 degrees, few people go into the water, and it almost becomes a decoration. However, I saw staff working with long water pipes by the pool early in the morning, and the water quality and hygiene seemed very good. It would be great if this swimming pool could use warm water. 2. Whether it is the lobby or the room, the decoration style is very modern and pleasing to the eye. However, the small supermarket at the elevator entrance on the fifth floor seems to have traveled through time, or it is more appropriate to say that it is a canteen. Maybe it is because it is opened in the hotel, and the price is a bit too high. A bag of melon seeds worth *** yuan in the supermarket outside is sold for 10 yuan here. I don't know if it is reasonable. 3. In addition to disposable slippers, the room also provides plastic slippers. In fact, as long as unified disinfection is done, plastic slippers will be convenient for guests. But both pairs are very ordinary dark blue slippers, and there is no hotel logo. I saw that the hotel's bath products have beautiful colors, rose red, azure blue, avocado green (see picture). Why not continue to use this color matching to customize plastic slippers for men and women?
Because I booked a room without breakfast, I don't know the breakfast situation. But seeing the advertisements in the elevator and on the lobby screen, I feel that the hotel restaurant is not expensive, and it is even cheaper than the restaurants outside.

msg:Tell the truth. Wyndham is really disappointing
When I entered the store for check-in, the front desk told me that I needed to wait for about 10 minutes. I checked in first, and there was no tea during the period. After completing the procedures, I told me that it would take about 7 to 8 minutes to complete the sanitation. I waited in the lobby for more than 20 minutes, but there was still no tea, and the front desk did not inform the room status. I sat in the front desk's sight range.
Entering the room, there is a strong fishy smell, except for this hygiene aspect, which is good.
In the hot Sanya, the refrigerator is empty. I live in a mid-range hotel like Lavande, and I also put at least two bottles of mineral water or soft drinks. Wyndham had nothing, and he couldn't understand.
TV can only be watched live, even if the movie is charged, it is also charged for screen casting. I am afraid that it is not crazy to think about money? ? ?
During the epidemic, the hotel was not equipped with hand sanitizer, so I called the service center and told me to send me two more bottles of shower gel and let me wash my hands with shower gel. Such a big hotel can't justify it.
The most serious thing is that the newly opened slippers have traces of passing through.
If you are more concerned about service, don't think about it, Bi Wyndham is cheaper.

First of all, thank you very much for the front desk. It seems to be called Huang Menghua. The young lady is very gentle and kind. She helped me solve two things: 1. Continue to live without changing the room. Compared with my order, the room has been upgraded by two levels. 2. My stroller landed in the hotel's underground parking lot. She helped me find someone to keep it at the front desk. There are many guests in the hotel. She can remember my room number and feels very kind.
Secondly, stay for five consecutive days and talk about my personal experience.
1. Children's facilities, my baby rarely swims, sand and children's playground are unwilling to go out, and it is not hard to take children.
2. The hotel room is large and close to the harbour, but the bedding is not damp and it is very comfortable to use.
3. There is a bathtub, it is very convenient to bathe children, the elderly can also take a bubble bath. Compared with the small toilets in Beijing, heaven and earth! ! !
4. Breakfast is no joy and no worries. There are not many varieties, the bread is relatively dry, and it does not seem to be freshly made. The steamed dim sum is okay.
5. Take the elderly and children, take out every day, it's okay.
6. There are snacks and vegetable markets on nearby Yucun Road, and it is more convenient to buy fruits.
7. It would be great if the room service could increase the place to throw away the take-out packaging. Takeaway is very important, don‚Äôt know where to throw it out in time after eating?
8. Transportation. I rented a car, it was convenient to travel, and I didn't know the public transportation of the hotel.
In short, if you are like me, with the elderly and children, it is recommended to stay.

The lounge area in the lobby does not seem to have been cleaned. The room was pretty good, the bed was great, and I fell asleep very comfortably. The breakfast is average, there are not many varieties, the products are so-so, the dining table is a bit messy, there are notched bowls, and the salt and pepper shakers are dirty. However, the attitude of the staff is still very friendly and natural. Generally speaking, they feel average, not up to expectations. After check-out, there is a sense of follow-up guest experience, and guest satisfaction is still available for return visits.

That very special fan is also very useful. The air conditioner is too cold and the fan is just right.
This room type is perfect in every aspect. My husband is allergic to dust mites, but he hasn't sneezed in this room, which is very good! So in the days to come, even if he stayed in other hotels, Sheraton, Shangri-La, etc., he said that it was not as good as this hotel to evaluate whether there are dust mites in the hotel, and if the cleaning is not clean, he is a humanoid evaluation machine.

msg:To be honest, I don't want to comment. Why comment may be understood after reading it.
I checked in at about 2pm on the 10.2 and turned on the air conditioner and went out for dinner. I came back after 4pm. If the room was still hot, I called the front desk to request repairs. It should be about 20 minutes before the maintenance staff has started to deal with it. During the period, I was I made three phone calls to the front desk. The repair was completed (the repair process requires me to cooperate with the master to switch the air conditioner and other operations). I understand that cooling takes time. After two hours of swimming in all aspects, the room does not feel cold. Finally, I changed it. Room. This problem has basically been solved. In terms of hygiene, I posted a picture. I won‚Äôt elaborate on it. It‚Äôs also a trivial matter. (The hotels mentioned above have also changed rooms in all aspects of delivery of fruit plates, although the efficiency is low, but the problem has been solved)
Here comes the point. I stayed for two. The hotel included breakfast the next day. But we finished eating at about 10:30. We had nausea and vomiting together. (Specifically, my girlfriend is 1 o‚Äôclock at 12 o‚Äôclock). The reason why I want to comment. I am not sure that it is the hotel breakfast. But based on the reality. My judgment is so. It lasted until 19:27 when I posted this review. Picture one is the lobby toilet where we just took turns to vomit .
I have stayed in several hotels in Sanya in the past few days. I don‚Äôt have to go to Wyndham. Everything I said is based on my personal experience and judgment. Seek truth from facts.

I saw this hotel opened in 2018 on Ctrip. It is the latest hotel under the same conditions, and the facilities are really good. The rooms are bright and tidy, large enough in size, and well-equipped.
When Ctrip placed the order, I forgot to modify the room type. The system defaults to a double room. In fact, I want to choose a twin room. When I checked in, the lady at the front desk patiently helped us find a twin room. It happened the next day. If you have a twin room check out, we are lucky to be able to stay even without moving. Thank you very much, the lady at the front desk of the hotel.
The hotel has two shuttle buses to Haitang Bay Duty Free City in the morning and two in the afternoon. The barbecue on the first floor of the hotel is also delicious and can be delivered to the room. There is a convenience store on the right hand side of the lobby, and the proprietress is also super cute.

The breakfast at the hotel is very good, especially for those of us who bring children to eat early and late, very friendly! After 12:30, I still have everything, and the taste of fried noodles is amazing! The only dissatisfaction is the hotel's self-service laundry room, equipment leaks, poor hygiene. Since it is paid for use, at least sanitation must be guaranteed. There is nothing unusual in that washing machine runner, such as paper, shells, sand, coins, lighters and so on. The other lady and I did not wash any clothes the first time we paid for it, so we disinfected the hotel washing machine first. Then I called the radio and asked the guest room to come and clean it. As a result, the guest room aunt came. I guess I can't stand it anymore. After wiping a rag, the aunt ran to find a rag to wipe. I think that as a hotel, you can charge a little higher. This is no problem at all. At least you must ensure that the washing machine is disinfected once a day and cleaned regularly! Come, give you a real picture to feel it.

Also, we checked out before ten o'clock in the morning, and received a phone call from the hotel around three o'clock in the afternoon asking if we had damaged the TV. There was a crack in the corner of the TV. I explained to her that my child is already ten years old, and in the room he played switch except for swimming, and we had not even turned on the TV.

The architectural pattern is that the north and south wings fly together, with the lobby in the middle and various water splashing facilities under the lobby. The upper layer is an infinity swimming pool with a water depth of 1.4 meters, which is safe and comfortable; the lower layer has various hydrophilic facilities, which can swing, ride on the slide, and ride, and allow children to dig in the sand. There is a fish pool and massage on the side. Pool... The room has a balcony to dry clothes, and the bed is soft and hard. The most important thing for people who live in many hotels is to have a comfortable bed. There are still many facilities, such as fitness, K singing, etc. I have not experienced. This trip is at a turning point in life. I need to relax my mind and imagine the future. Meeting Wyndham is also a kind of fate.

msg:With the idea of giving it a try, I booked a room for two nights first. After I checked in, I was given the thoughtful and enthusiastic service (the smile of the manager at the front desk, the northeast brother who helped carry the luggage, and the yellow grid on duty at night), clean and hygienic Conditions (cleaning in time, and thoughtful free foot bathing), the breakfast time in the restaurant is extended to one in the afternoon, which makes us really happy when we sleep late. Although the hotel address is a bit off, the hotel has supporting business vehicles (Benz 9-seater) ), it can be delivered to Dadonghai, Xiaodonghai, Zhongfu Duty Free Shop, and of course there are free buses to China Duty Free Shop. There is also a swimming pool, small fish go to the dead skin pool, gymnasium, laundry room (20 yuan per wash, I wash once, which is very convenient), and the hotel restaurant service is also super good (Zheng Fei, Huang Xinrui brothers have a really good attitude Nothing to say,), kind attitude, decisively renewed for another 4 nights! If you have to make comments, it would be better if you pick it up for free!

msg:I like this hotel very much, the key is that it is very cost-effective! Some people said that the hotel was unclean and buggy, but I decided it based on my trust in Wyndham Group! Driving here is super easy to find, the underground parking lot is very convenient, go directly to the open lobby, and also help me upgrade the room type for free, more than 300 live in a sea-view room, the room is air-conditioned! There is also a small balcony. Drinking, eating, supper and watching the scenery on the balcony is simply amazing! The swimming pool is also very good, the water is very clean, every day is the evening to go swimming after eating, a lot of facilities for children to play, small beaches, slides üòÅ I also had a lot of fun! All in all, I like this hotel very much, there is also a gym, KTV tea house, skewers and so on! But... also remind that this hotel is more friendly to car rental tourists, but if you take a bus and taxi, it is not very convenient. Although the hotel is very close to the city center, it is in a relatively quiet resort area, so it is still Advise everyone to rent a car! Traveling in Sanya is really convenient if you have a car, which saves time and prevents heat stroke

After eating, I went back to the room and took a nap in the afternoon with the children in the children‚Äôs amu*****t park. Play for a while, go to the swimming pool at night and spend a day like that. When you are hot and thirsty, go directly to the restaurant to refresh yourself (free of charge)

msg:It‚Äôs good to live in Wyndham in Wenchang. I didn‚Äôt hesitate to choose Wyndham in Sanya. The bed sheet always felt a little worn out, and it was as uncomfortable to sleep as a layer of sand.
The bathroom is super large and very comfortable. There is also a large bathtub and a rack for drying clothes. The small fish presented is a bit big. The infinity pool is not as good as expected. Just take photos of the Internet celebrities. The pool is also very shallow. Swimming, parent-child activities are okay, the water is not very clean.

msg:The hotel is not big, but it has all the internal organs, it is not boring to bring children, there is a children's playground, there are children's bicycles, sand pool, children's pool, breakfast is average, easy to eat, and the taste is decent. You can rent a swimming ring, 20 for a fee. Breakfast for children within 1.2 meters is free, and breakfast is still necessary. It‚Äôs to be comfortable when you come out to play. The point is that breakfast is delayed until 1 o‚Äôclock, which is especially suitable for lazy people. The hotel is far from the beach, and there is a big slope at the door. Every time the takeaway boy has to walk up, it is not practical to go out to find food by himself, so he can only go out with the hotel's shuttle bus or drop by drops. The hotel has a shuttle bus every hour from 10 am to 18 pm. Dadonghai, Luhuitou, and Xiaodonghai can all go to it, which is quite convenient. Overall it feels pretty good! The point is that the pool evening pictures are so beautiful!

msg:On the first day of coming to Sanya, the hotel hardware settings and services are in line with the characteristics of chain hotels. The most important thing is that this season's price is reasonable and cost-effective. The hotel lobby has a long view of the day and night scenes. The swimming pool little treasure can be played as soon as it comes. It is better for children to have fun. It is suitable for a family outing. The room is clean and tidy. I also experienced the hotel special car to the Dadonghai beach for a circle.

It is a waste that I can't swim. The check-in is very smooth. I will upgrade the room and the room. Spacious and comfortable, get up early and ride a bicycle on the southern sea road until you reach the seaside, where you can watch the sunrise. The surrounding environment is beautiful. The bus station is right in front of the hotel, which is very convenient. There are duty-free shops to pick up and drop off the car... It's a worthwhile trip, it's great

msg:The hotel can't be said to be an authentic 5-star. The overall feeling is that it feels like an economical and convenient hotel, which is better than that. The breakfast is also very rich, but the taste is average. I ordered a family room, the room is slightly smaller, with a large bed + a sofa bed, and a coffee table is very crowded. I looked at the evaluation before and saw that it was cheaper to book later than early. Sure enough, when I booked on the same day, the price was cheaper than when I booked. The place for children to play is very friendly. Although it is a bit small, it is good for younger children. There is also a sand digging place next to the swimming pool for children to play. There are many sand digging tools for free. Just make up for the small regret of not being a seaside hotel. Wouldn‚Äôt it be better for hotel guests to rent a swimming ring for 20 yuan? Fenghuang takes a taxi to the hotel for 60 yuan, the distance is not bad.

msg:Stayed for four days and five nights, Bay Suite, I used to stay at Wyndham before, so this time Sanya also searched Wyndham directly. A little episode is that when I booked the hotel, I also specifically noted that there should be no noise nearby. Yes, the hotel also said to try to arrange as much as possible. Obviously there are three suites that are empty (including the best one) and the final arrangement is the room with a squinting view of the bay... I just complained to Ctrip and the hotel immediately contacted me. Take me to see other rooms to choose by myself... Except for this little episode, others are still good, so I have to find a third party to book a hotel.. It is a disadvantage to communicate by myself! The service at the back is good. The breakfast is good, but there is no spa. If you are tired after a long day, you have to go to the spa outside, but the hotel is very considerate. Although there is no spa, it can provide foot bath barrels üòÑ Overall, the service is good. In place! Wyndham is good at solving problems as soon as possible. Relaxing on vacation is worth choosing

I didn‚Äôt look at other hotels this year and decided to book here directly. Still as good as ever. There is also a free hotel shuttle to nearby attractions. The driver was very nice. We asked him when the tide in Xiaodonghai was low and we wanted to catch crabs. He made a special trip to check the tide table and called him to tell us, which was very heartwarming.
