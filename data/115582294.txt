msg:Advantages: The hotel is clean and tidy. We didn't book a family room when traveling with our baby. The bed in this king-size room is very big and not crowded. There is a big market opposite the hotel, but I haven't been there. I heard that the seafood there can be cooked fresh. There are no attractions around, so there is no traffic jam. Seeing that we are with our baby, they also gave the child breakfast, which is very considerate! Disadvantages: First, when checking in, I reminded the front desk that I wanted an extra single quilt because I was with my baby, but I didn't get it until I left the hotel. Fortunately, the room was not cold. Second, breakfast is 7-10 o'clock. We went to the restaurant at 9 o'clock on the first day. There was no bread and the dishes were served slowly. On the second day, we only saw bread slices, and there were still no other varieties. I wanted to eat oa**eal noodles, but the chef didn't cook them because there were still many bowls of white noodles. The dishes were exactly the same for two days!

First, they have to charge a deposit of 300, which makes me feel a bit distrustful. The second is the purified water in the room. It is a very small bottle. Only two bottles are given. There is a charge for more than one bottle. Third, the scale is broken. Fourth, when I needed to register my car number when I went out, the girl at the front desk was not very skilled, which was a bit of a waste of time.

msg:Facilities: Not too much like a [luxury hotel]. The facilities are really not in place, the room is small and the bathroom is also small. It’s slightly better than All Seasons or something, and it also comes with a small bag of laundry detergent, which barely scores 3 points.
Cleanliness: It's quite clean. No one takes care of it except for the green plants. I could give it 5 points but I'm not willing to give it because I didn't sleep well.
Environment: It's pretty bad. It has just been renovated. There is a strong smell of new furniture in the room, mixed with the hotel's aromatherapy, which is very unpleasant. There's no ventilation when the windows are opened, so it's impossible to get out. The entire exterior wall of the hotel looked like it was made of paper, and the sound of fireworks and firecrackers made it impossible to sleep. The windows are not soundproof at all. Don't tell me, I couldn't hear the firecrackers and fireworks at another hotel. I originally planned to stay in Hohhot for three days and booked a hotel for three days. On one day, I checked out overnight and left Hohhot.
Service: The service is very poor. I made a note that I wanted a quiet room, but the front desk [lied to me] and said they would find me an "unoccupied room" on this floor. I said it would be fine if there were people on this floor, but stay away from them. They said, "No one lives on this floor." . I went upstairs and saw it at the elevator entrance. So I went downstairs to change rooms and was assigned to another room on the same floor. When I was passing by, I saw door lights on in other rooms in the corridor. There were people living on both sides of my room. I came back late in the evening, and as soon as I entered the corridor, I heard the sound of children screaming. You can tell me at the front desk that there are no rooms available. Why did you lie to me that no one lives on this floor? I didn't receive much welcome when I entered the hotel. I asked the front desk if there was breakfast in my room and she said no. I got up early and took another look. I was wondering if there was breakfast. Why did she tell me there was no breakfast? The breakfast buffet cost 88 a piece. It was said that the hotel buffet restaurant was on holiday and the food was delivered to the room. This is the food that was served, and there was an extra portion of haggis in it, so it’s a matter of opinion.

msg:It used to be HNA Hotel, but it was renamed Lanyang Linton after renovation. The facilities are relatively new, there is a parking lot, and the transportation is convenient. The breakfast is the highlight and has a rich variety. The toiletries have a unique smell. The non-intelligent heated toilet is equipped with a non-woven toilet mat that will not be too cold in winter. The direct water supply next to the basin has a yellow flow when it is first turned on, so I have never dared to use it. The free bottled water in the room is limited to 3 bottles per day. labels are also rare. The warm air in the room is very powerful. This time we encountered a heavy snow and cold wave, and the temperature difference between indoor and outdoor was 40 degrees. There is no food delivery robot. To take out food, the food delivery person needs to find the front desk to swipe the elevator. Occasionally, if he cannot swipe the elevator when it is busy, he has to go down and pick it up himself.
There is no deposit reminder for Ctrip prepayment orders. When checking in, you need to prepay a deposit of ¥400 to the hotel and it will be refunded after leaving the hotel. (It’s been a long time since I’ve encountered a hotel that requires a deposit. This feels like a time travel. It’s not a star-rated hotel and it doesn’t have a room-charged wine cabinet. Maybe it’s because the new facilities are afraid of damage)

msg:I'm really sorry. When we checked out on the 5th, the hotel front desk asked if I could comment on it. I agreed at the time, but I forgot because of the tiredness of the journey. Now I'm following up with the review.

Facilities: I heard that the hotel is newly opened, and all kinds of facilities are also new. The room is also equipped with Xiaodu voice assistant, safe and small refrigerator. Overall, it's good. (It is recommended to check the small refrigerator. It is damaged. I forgot to report it to you at the time).
Hygiene: The hygiene is very clean, there is no odor in the room, and daily cleaning is also timely.
Environment: Next to the Normal University, and because it is a high-rise building, there is no construction around. Although it is not noisy on the street, it is good. It's okay to see the night view of Hohhot at night.
Service: The service is thoughtful. I arrived in Hohhot on the 2nd and arranged a driver to pick me up at the airport on the same day (I need to make an appoin**ent with the hotel in advance), which is very convenient. The hotel provides breakfast, various Chinese food, cakes, salads, etc. are all available in sufficient quantities, and the experience is good.
Overall, the check-in experience is very good and can be given full marks. The room environment is consistent with the platform photos, and laundry detergent and razors are also provided, which saves a lot of trouble, but the photos were not taken. I quite like the smell of the hotel's shower gel, but I didn't remember what it was. When I left, the front desk also gave me some small gifts (snacks), which left a good impression.
A few small suggestions: the hotel may need to pay attention to the small details, as shown in the photo below.

      It's a pity that the wardrobe is old, the small tea table in the room is old, with many spots and numerous scratches, and the window frame has gray spots left over from decoration, which is unsightly. What's even more speechless is that the bathroom door is twisted and deformed and cannot be closed at all. I told the front desk to send a floor attendant to come up and check, but they couldn't close it. It's not like the newly opened hotel mentioned on the platform.
       Finally had to ask to change rooms.
      After changing rooms, the attendant on the 15th floor asked us how we entered the room and when we entered. The attitude was very unfriendly. We had no choice but to reply to the front desk who agreed to change rooms and let us in.

msg:The original old HNA, I have been living here for about three years when I was on a business trip. It has been renovated and just opened. Everything is very good👍🏻. The current environment is much better than the original Mongolian style, elegant and beautiful, and more suitable for modern times. In terms of human aesthetics, although it has just opened, there is no smell in the room. The overall feeling is very good! There is the Dongwayao Seafood Market downstairs, just a few minutes' walk away. I used to eat downstairs often.

msg:這是我第二次入住藍洋林頓，第一次是直接到前台辦的入住，總體感覺還行，床和枕頭都很好，這次才通過攜程預訂。酒店裝修很新，硬件不錯。早餐不錯。直接説不好的吧。1.窗簾能電動關，不能電動開。2.水壓不穩，洗澡的時候冷水調到最大，水還很燙，過了好一會才將就着洗完。3.睡到早上5點40，突然房間燈全亮了，我一臉懵，第一次碰到這樣的事，起床，看錶關燈睡覺💤4.臨近馬路，窗户隔音效果一般，早上是被吵醒的。5.通過攜程預訂的選擇了積分兑換水果，直到退房，也沒有給我（不是介意水果，衹是陳述事實）
