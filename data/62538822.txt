As a southerner who goes to the dry north, the amount of water he drinks naturally increases greatly, and the hotel provides unlimited free drinking water. This is particularly awesome!
The sink in the bathroom is too low, so you have to bend down and squat down to wash. This must be changed.

The most surprising thing was that I didn't want to go out at night, so I ordered a few dishes at the restaurant on the first floor of the hotel. There were not many people, so I thought it would be a disaster. Unexpectedly, the food tasted good, the price was very reasonable, and it was obviously freshly made, not pre-made. The average cost per person was about 50 or 60 yuan. The service was good and there was no service charge. Hahaha, in a word, I was quite satisfied.

The layout of the restaurant is also very strange. The aisle between the seats and the dining table is just over one meter wide, and it is still the main aisle. Imagine what it would be like when there are many people. When checking out, the front desk asked about the check-in experience, and the answer was "very average." Then the three people at the front desk all nodded and said nothing. The guest rooms are small and the service staff are amateurish. They don't look like they have been specially trained and are running wildly in the guest room corridors. The surrounding area is very deserted. There are only a few small restaurants across the main road. You have to go through the city to get out of the city. It is definitely inconvenient to travel by car. Very low value for money hotel, not recommended.

msg:因為永樂宮，我知道了運城的存在，開了三百多公里來到這裏，發現諾富特酒店的評價不錯於是就預訂了，沒想到國慶節還居然漲價了不少，平時據説300多就可以預訂了。

這是隸屬於華住集團的酒店，應該也有國際酒店管理標準的，算是這座城裡不錯的酒店，我沒有辦理他們的會員卡，所以沒有訂他們的早飯（據説很豐富）。

因為太累，然後看旁邊也沒有什麼吃的，於是就選擇了叫外賣，這個酒店的外賣是機器人可以送上來的，哈哈哈哈，也算是疫情期間不錯的創新方式。

國慶節期間入住的人也不多，晚上還可以聽到對面學校裏女生們半夜三更唱歌，我差點就想換房間了，好在唱到10點就停了。

整體的體驗吧，山西目前還沒有設計感很強的酒店，所以200左右的酒店其實就差不多能夠滿足“住”的基本要求了，大家以後可以參考這個標準選擇山西酒店。

這裏表揚一下前台的小妹妹，送了一個國慶特別版口罩給我，很可愛! 運城，我們會再見麼~
