Food is delicate at Chinese restaurant , but not much variety for breakfast buffet. It is definitely a good vacation with Southeast Asia atmosphere.

The rooms are spacious and modern. The restaurant food is good.  I think the hotel is a perfect escape from the city. 
If I understand right, most rooms are smoking rooms. As I was put in a smoking room at firs, I asked to be moved to a non-smoking room.
The new room smelled like a smoking room + air freshener. I appreciated the effort the staff took to prepare another room for me, but it still smelled :) The smell bothered me a bit.

msg:It's Broken,  But Here's a Fruit Platter! 
We were very excited got our trip.  We booked the villa with private pool.  
First things first,  Jack had excellent customer service and spoke good English.  He  kept in contact with us throughout the stay and answered all our questions. 
Now.. let's get into it.  
The private swimming pool is freezing.  It feels like bring in an ice bath.  I contacted the hotel to find out that it had no heating and that the jets in the Jacuzzi section of the pool was broken.  To compensate we were given a plate of fruit 
The next day I decided to have a bath in the marvelous bathroom.  Guess what?  The jets in the bath were broken.  We were given another plate of fruit and some Coca-Cola to compensate.  
There were horrible stains on the carpet and the second room looks like Winnie The Pooh exploded in there.  Very unappealing.  The public swimming pools were closed. 
The garden and private pool need to be tended to.  The gardens are overgrown and not looked after. 
The whole resort reminds me of a place that was once loved and cared for but now is left to rot and break down.  
On to the hot springs,  the hot springs section was lovely.  The pools were well heated and tended to.  It's a section of the resort that is looked after.  However... only half of the jets and waterfall features in the large hot spring pool worked. 
Now for the food.  It was basic,  for 168rmb per person it's not worth it.  If we knew we would have cooking facilities in the villa we would have brought our own food.  It is also too far away from everything to order food.  
Staff: All staff we encountered were lovely and happy to help.  I think they felt bad that things in the hotel were broken and tried to give what they could (fruit plates) 
Overall,  I would return for the hot springs.  Maybe camp at their site but try not to expect too much from them.  For the price we paid for a villa it was so dissapointing that the bathtub and pool jacuzzi didn't work. 
Also,  people will walk into your private garden without giving you notice so be careful if you are sunbathing.

I experienced taking a bath in the spring pool when it rained, which was very refreshing. I also went to Yang Chinese Restaurant for dinner. The taste was good and the price was reasonable. The Chinese restaurant is by the lake and the environment is very good. I should have walked before eating. After eating, it was dark, so I walked back to the room. It was a pity. The service was also very good. You can call a taxi anywhere, which is very timely. There are two swimming pools, both of which are very large. It’s a pity that I only came for one day, and it was raining season. I hope to experience the swimming pool next time.

msg:During the May Day holiday, the customer flow was large, but the service attitude and quality were online, especially the front desk staff Xiao Pan, who was enthusiastic, patient, meticulous and thoughtful, which relieved many of my worries before coming and solved many unexpected problems.
The hotel environment is very good. It should be a summer resort in summer. It has been raining recently, so it is still a bit cold, otherwise swimming in the swimming pool is also good. There will be mosquitoes, so you can bring your own mosquito repellent. People who like quiet private space should like it here, and the room is very spacious, so it is also very comfortable to stay in the room.
Another point is quite impressive. The corners of the hotel are basically smoothed. There are many children in this hotel, which reduces the risk of children getting injured, and the children's playground is also wrapped.
The buffet is 198 per person, with not many varieties, but it can be full. Because the hotel is located in a remote area, we don't want to toss with two children, so we are very satisfied to have a buffet. However, my daughter's bird-like appetite makes me feel that it is too bad. In fact, no matter how big the appetite of a child is, he can't eat much. In addition, parents with children usually can't eat much themselves in order to take care of their children, and don't expect to eat ** [covering face]. Breakfast is relatively crowded and you need to wait for a seat. It is recommended that the waiter can remind those who have finished eating to leave and give up their seats, otherwise it will take a whole morning for morning tea and other people will not have to eat.
The rooms in the villa area are divided into three floors, upper, middle and lower, but there is no elevator. Although there are many shuttle buses in the hotel, you still have to go up and down the stairs by yourself. If you have a lot of luggage or have inconvenient legs and feet, it is recommended not to choose the villa area.
The playground is really a savior for parents on rainy days. It is clean and hygienic, there is enough to play, the space is relatively large, and the children have enough activities. They sleep at the end of the night. It would be better if the bar next to it is open for use.
In short, the environment is first-class, and the waiter's service is also dedicated. The only drawback is that the hotel's carrying capacity is limited. When the passenger flow is large, the service is easy to lag behind, such as the toilet hygiene in the lobby and restaurant. But next time I will choose this hotel, it will definitely be better when the weather is good and there are fewer people.

First of all, the hotel's 🍞breakfast and dinner are quite rich. The diverse choices not only satisfy the tastes of children, but also make us adults eat with relish. Each dish is carefully made and tastes excellent, which is really praiseworthy💯.

Let's talk about the hotel's hot springs♨. Although there are not many, the experience is great. The hot spring time from 3 pm to 11 pm every day gives us enough time to enjoy this comfort and tranquility💫. The water quality of the hot spring is clear and the temperature is suitable, which makes people feel relaxed❤.

The children's playground🎠 is a paradise for children. The venue is clean and sanitary, and the recreational facilities are rich and varied, and they are all well maintained. Children can play here to their heart's content, and adults can rest at ease.

📍Xiao Luo at the front desk👩💻 had a great service attitude, warm, gentle and polite. Not only did she provide us with thoughtful service, she also thoughtfully gave the children a small water gun, which really made us feel very warm🌹.

In terms of the room, the space is spacious and the layout is comfortable. Especially the super large bathtub🛁, children can play with water. The bed is soft and comfortable, allowing us to have a good sleep at night.

In general, the hotel stay experience this time is very good. The children had fun and the adults felt comfortable. I will choose here next time!

1. Excellent hotel service
The hotel service is very good. From check-in to check-out, I can feel the enthusiasm of the service staff. I don't have that special feeling of rejection, which is very good~
Special room layout
2. The layout of the room is very good. It is 60 square meters and has a window sill for viewing. It is great and the oversized bed is so comfortable! The room facilities are complete and the toiletries are well prepared. The bedding is clean and comfortable and of high quality. It can be achieved My request for the hotel

The hygiene of a hotel is really important to a hotel. Both the bed and the bathroom in the room are excellent. It’s also very peaceful to sleep on a clean bed~
What made me feel very considerate this time was Master Zhang who picked up and dropped off the car. I could feel his dedication. From him, I could feel the hotel’s humanistic care for its customers. The swimming pool, breakfast, hot spring and playground were all very well equipped and very cost-effective. Very high, I will definitely take my family to this hotel.

Come on vacation comfortably, it really has a Southeast Asian feel
You can already feel relaxed as soon as you enter the hotel.
We booked the Undersea Column parent-child room.
The room layout is super comfortable and there is no smell in the whole room
The bed and quilt are so comfortable
The bathtub in the toilet is also Toto.
Separate toilet and shower room
The most important thing is that there is a ceiling fan in the room
Really full of Southeast Asian a**osphere
My youngest son was still angry that day.
The hotel helped set it up without saying a word.
We came back from the hot springs. The room was well decorated and super comfortable.
Our father-in-law said he would come here for vacation next time

msg:If you have your own transportation package, this hotel can definitely be considered. It's a little out of the way, but a must since you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of city life. The hotel design looks like Bali style. The front desk service is attentive, and there is a small tram that can take you to any part of the hotel at any time. The room is very spacious and comfortable. After all, it was the predecessor of the top foreign brand Sheraton. The hot spring facilities are first-class, which is a feature of staying here. Breakfast is average, not a lot of choices, but still ok. It's a pity that there are several points: the hotel has very few meal options and closes very early, so it cannot accommodate the need to enjoy the hot springs and eat later in the evening. The hot springs are only open from 3pm to 11pm. There was no way to take another dip before checking out in the morning. If you really enjoy hot springs, it is recommended to book a room with a private hot spring. There are very few options for dinner nearby at night, and difficult to find. In addition, when driving into the hotel through the publicly managed entrance, they have insufficient communication with the hotel. Sometimes they insist on charging even though the scan proves that they are guests (possibly a scam). Their bad attitude seriously affects the accommodation experience. Unfortunately, this is something the hotel has no control over.

msg:I have stayed in most high-end hot spring hotels around Guangdong, and this is my first time. Because I decided to take a hot spring bath at the last minute, I wanted to choose a cost-effective one. I was a little nervous before coming because I didn't know what the environmental facilities were like. When I arrived, I realized that my worries were unnecessary. The green environment is very good, the decoration feels more Southeast Asian style, the service staff have a very good attitude, and guests' feedback will be answered and resolved in a timely manner. The large bathtub in the room is a plus, but there are not many outdoor soaking pools, but they happen to be quite clean and very comfortable to soak in. The food in the Chinese restaurant tastes good and the portions are sufficient. Breakfast was mediocre. Overall, it was a good experience. I can rate it as a 4-star hotel in my heart. I will come back next time.

msg:I was on a business trip during the week. The hotel was very close to my destination and the price was right. I chose this hotel. Manager Hua was warm and thoughtful when entering and leaving the hotel. The hotel has a shuttle bus which is very convenient. The room is large in size, the terrace has a wide view and beautiful scenery. The hotel environment is very good and the hot spring is clean and hygienic. There are few people in this season, so Sihao does not affect the quality of service and breakfast. Very suitable for bringing children to play. You can spend the whole day without leaving the hotel. What a surprise discovery of a treasure hotel.

msg:For a resort hotel, the environment and service are pretty good. But it's not very big and the facilities are a bit old. What I don't like most is that the hotel is very dim, whether it's the room, lobby, restaurant, playground... As long as it's indoor, the lights are not bright enough.

msg:Taking a hot spring bath in the rain is as pleasant as taking a hot spring bath in the snow. The hot spring area and the hotel are not very large, surrounded by mountains and rivers, with winding paths leading to secluded places and Zen rooms surrounded by flowers and trees. The rooms are spacious and comfortable, basically impeccable, and the service is not deliberately created. Even the smile of the cleaning lady is very natural. The photos were taken casually to meet the requests of friends. I will post a few of them for reference.

msg:The hotel is very good both in terms of service and environment.
Environment: The surrounding area is quiet and has a lot of greenery, making it very suitable for vacation.
Service: The check-in front desk patiently answered our questions. Master Zhang, who drove the electric car to pick us up, also enthusiastically introduced us to the hotel's park facilities. In the evening, we received warm greetings from the housekeeper, and after check-out, we received a warm return visit from Michael.

Facilities: The hot spring area is better than most professional hot spring hotels. Everyone has an independent locked locker with clean thick towels and slippers. Many places outside serve self-service ginger tea, wolfberry tea and so on. The most satisfying part is that someone will come and ask if the hot spring water is warm enough and whether it needs to be heated. It really beats many hot spring hotels.
The slight drawback is that the heating in the room is not enough. In the weather of more than 10 degrees, it will still be very cold even if the heating is turned on at the highest temperature and only wear a bathrobe.
Because there were few people checking in that day, it is understandable that there are not many kinds of breakfast, but I hope it can be more refined. Sausages, fried eggs, and egg tarts are not insulated and will be cold when you get them. (Of course, the waiter will heat it up separately if we ask.)
The location for taking a taxi back and forth is to the banquet hall door. You need to ask for directions to the front desk. The distance is not far but the directions are not obvious, so it takes some time to find it. Especially when taking a taxi, the driver couldn't find the lobby, so he could only honk the horn and ask us to follow the sound.
Overall, the price/performance ratio is quite high, and it's not far from the airport. I will come here again next time I have the opportunity.

msg:It is a very suitable hotel for vacation. It has a quiet environment and lush green plants. There are hot springs in winter and 2 swimming pools. It will be very suitable for next summer.
The room is quite spacious and comfortable, clean and tidy, but the heating is not big enough. The traditional Cantonese heating is good at 20 degrees. The room is indeed a bit cold in winter. But it's quite comfortable to live in and very quiet.
You can call a battery car to get from your room to the lobby, restaurants, hotels, parking lots, and hot springs. The car will arrive in a few minutes, which is quite convenient.
It was quite comfortable to wander around the resort in the morning. Perfect for vacation.

msg:This hotel is crazy poor. The phone in the room is broken and you need to use your mobile phone to contact the front desk. I called the hotel front desk and a male waiter said that they only gave me four bottles of mineral water and I need to charge for more. I said I used water for milk for my child and he said that was not allowed. Disposable bath bags cost ten yuan. The front desk service was very poor. The room facilities were very old. There was no elevator and the luggage and baby carriage had to be carried to the second floor. I have traveled all over the country and stayed in so many places, but this is the first time I need such poor hotel service.

msg:The hotel park is relatively large, and various room types are distributed in every corner of the park, but you can call a battery car to pick you up. It is relatively quiet and suitable for people who like quiet. The air is good and you can take a walk in the park. If I remember correctly, you can take a hot spring bath from 15:00-23:00. Maintenance of the park is not easy, and some facilities are old. It is better to drive by yourself. We did not drive in and out, and it was not convenient to eat. Maybe it is because during the Chinese New Year, there are not many options for dining in Chinese restaurants and they are expensive. The balcony of our room faced the tent area, with a good view, the bed was clean, and the bathroom had a bit of an industrial feel, but I was not used to washing my face without hot water in the morning. The attitude of the front desk and other service staff was impressive, especially Zhou Hong, who was very enthusiastic and thoughtful.

The lady at the front desk saw that I brought my children and took the initiative to upgrade me to a parent-child room. The children were very happy. Later, we were given an extra breakfast for the children. We live relatively close to the front desk and are not far from the restaurant. The shuttle bus responds very quickly and is basically always available. The hotel is very suitable for a family vacation. There are hot springs to meet the needs of adults and a playground suitable for children. It's a pity that the weather was not very good when we went there, so we didn't have a good stroll.
As for the shortcomings, some facilities are indeed broken and have not been repaired in time. Regardless of the faults, it was a very pleasant experience. I would like to come again next time when the weather is nice.

msg:Environment: The hotel is mid-to-high-end and elegant. The air environment is relatively ok. It is suitable for families, group building, and young couples. It is not recommended for those who don’t drive. It is really inconvenient to travel. It is basically impossible to call Didi at night.

Facilities: The design of the room is quite good and very grand. The price/performance ratio is very good. The bed is very comfortable. Some lights in the room are broken and cannot be turned on.
The WiFi in the hotel is average and basically unusable, so there is no need to think about playing games.
Here is a reminder to the hotel (the table football, a public recreational facility on the second floor of the hotel, is broken and can fall off easily)

Hygiene: In terms of hygiene, it may be a little bit worse. There are still hairs and stains in the bathtub.

Service: Generally speaking, I am very satisfied. Especially the guys in the pick-up and drop-off depar**ent are very nice and very enthusiastic, especially the guy who is in the internship period. The lady at the front desk is also very enthusiastic. Before checking in, I personally informed that the phone in the room was broken. But before checking out today, I was very dissatisfied. After breakfast in the hotel at 10.30 in the morning, I came to the first floor and saw four receptionists gathered together (two men and two women). I didn’t know what to write. No one asked me if I still needed it. I asked first to say that I needed it. Someone will take care of you if you use a car
 Secondly, after calling the car for me, I asked if my room can be checked out at 2 o'clock (I bought the late check-out right). There was a female manager or supervisor who said directly that no, it was 12 o'clock. Check out and it was quite busy today as there was a group that wanted to check in and they had to check out at 12 o'clock, so I went on to say, didn't I buy a check out delay? Why 12 o'clock? It was later said that yes, you can withdraw at 2 o'clock.
So I have a question. If there are some people who don't understand and refuse, then I will check out at 12 o'clock stupidly. Who will protect the right to delay check-out after buying it? I suggest that the hotel should be more careful in this regard. Is it possible for a team to neglect individuals?
 During my stay, Manager Zhou Hong’s service was also very enthusiastic and he responded quickly to WeChat.

The environment of the park is large and clean. My brother played for two days and was reluctant to leave. Furthermore, the hot springs only opened at 3 pm. The changing rooms are a bit small. Feng Bingbing is the best place to soak in the hot springs. What is slightly lacking is the maintenance of the public areas. After all, it has been open for so many years and is a bit old. It needs to be replaced in time. All in all, I will give it a second try.

I read Xiaohongshu Homework the night before departure, and it was basically full of complaints. It scared me so much that I wanted to check out all night long. In the end, the child’s father told me not to check out as we were almost ready to move in [Disappointed R]

I’m really glad I didn’t quit! The room is super big and comfortable! (I think some sweet potatoes have a smell, which is true, but after we opened the door to ventilate it for half an hour, the smell was basically gone~ so this is within the acceptable range~)

There are two children's playgrounds in the hotel, one suitable for older babies and one suitable for small babies. We basically spent two days in it, and bb went crazy! so happy! [Like R]

As for the hot springs, hahahaha, well, what Xiao Hongshu complained about is true hahaha. If you come here to soak in the hot springs, you may be disappointed hahahahaha. I didn’t even take a dip in the hot springs in the hotel. I took a bath with my baby in the room. Bath bag haha, bb is also quite happy!
The Chinese restaurant in the hotel is delicious! Generous portion! It’s more expensive but convenient. You don’t have to go out (it’s very inconvenient to take your bb with you). It’s recommended to order a set meal instead of a la carte. The set meal is much more cost-effective. For example, we had 3 dishes plus a steamed egg with less salt for bb, which cost more than 400. ...The set meal has many more dishes! ! (regret)
It’s ready for bb to have steamed egg mixed with rice for dinner! There are sweet potatoes, noodle soup, and corn for breakfast. You can eat these without any seasonings!
Everywhere in the park is full of scenery! Take bb for a walk and see how time has passed. There are many green plants. I feel more relaxed! Finally, I saw a lot of complaints about poor service from Little Sweet Potato, but my overall experience this time was very good. The staff I met were very enthusiastic. In the morning, there was an aunt at the door who was sorting things out. She greeted us politely when she saw us. Manager Hua’s service was very good.

msg:Manager Zhou's reception service showed a high degree of enthusiasm and affinity, and this positive emotion left a deep impression on the customers. During the check-in process, Manager Zhou showed professional skills and efficient work. The whole process was very smooth and very satisfying.

His service attitude makes people feel relaxed and pleasant, which also makes the whole stay relaxed and enjoyable. His attention to and handling of details also reflects his professionalism and sense of responsibility, which gives me a higher degree of trust in the company he represents.

Overall, Manager Zhou's performance was very pleasant and satisfying, and I was deeply impressed by his enthusiasm and professionalism. I look forward to having the opportunity to enjoy his warm and professional service again in the future.

We had a buffet at the hotel restaurant for dinner. The dishes were relatively simple and filling! Manager Zhou provided a buffet breakfast for the next day. I slept too late and didn't eat it. I delayed check-out for free, which was perfect!

Overall, the environment and service were good, but one night passed too quickly! I didn’t go to the hot springs, but I’ll go there next time if I have the chance!

msg:Don’t choose an independent pool room in the villa area! No privacy at all!
After taking a shower, I walked towards the swimming pool and found other hotel guests trespassing (the independent villas have a path that leads around the bedroom pool) and two ladies were posing for photos next to my so-called private independent swimming pool. I don’t know how long they have been here or whether they saw me in the privacy of the house. Later, the hotel called the surveillance camera (for 20 minutes) to admit that other guests had trespassed and offered to send me lunch as compensation. Later, they said they could take me to the airport (I also have a car), and then a man wearing maintenance worker clothes said he was the manager on duty that day. After calling for more than half an hour to seek the opinion of the so-called superior, he said that he could give me a 10% discount on the room rate as compensation. I started boycotting them about the above issue from the time I checked out at 12:15 until 1:30. I was also hungry and said that I would accept the plan of lunch, 10% off and airport transfer. Speechless! The hotel itself is remote and there is nothing good to visit nearby. It was already two o'clock in the afternoon when I stayed for lunch. Moreover, the two male managers who dealt with the problem both made arguments like "You are a man and nothing will happen to you", which is even more unbelievable. There is no sense of security in such a big hotel with such poor service. I have stayed in so many countries and cities and no hotel has sent a maintenance man to negotiate with guests to solve the problem. In short, the doors to the swimming pool and rooms are not locked inside the house, and outsiders can come in and out at will. As the completely at fault party, the hotel has no sense of responsibility and the solution proposed is also perfunctory. Passers-by, please think twice about checking in.

The hotel's facilities are very luxurious, the rooms are spacious and comfortable, beautifully decorated and well-equipped. The room I stayed in faced the woods, and it was a pleasure to wake up to the magnificent mountain view every morning. The bed was very comfortable and allowed me to have a good night's sleep.

The service at the hotel was also excellent, the staff were very friendly and helpful. Whether it's the front desk or room service, they always have a smile on their face and are always ready to meet guests' needs. Especially the front desk manager Wen! All requests are answered! Excellent service! Thumbs up for her!

The hotel's dining options are also very rich, whether it is breakfast, lunch or dinner, they can meet the needs of different tastes. I especially love their breakfast, the fresh fruit fills my mouth.

In addition, the hotel also provides various recreational facilities such as swimming pools, gyms and hot springs. I had a relaxing massage at the spa and it was so soothing and relaxing!

2. The transportation is convenient. It is 15 minutes' drive from the subway station, and the parking is convenient, which is also very suitable for self-driving travel.
3. Whether it is the lobby or the room, the hotel is clean and comfortable.
4. The most attractive thing is the environment. The air is fresh and the environment is beautiful. There are two outdoor swimming pools, as well as hot springs, gyms, tent rooms, go-karts, and lakeside plank roads.
Thank you, Manager Hua, come to play again next time [Celebration]
5. The hotel has a rich variety of breakfast, both Chinese and Western food, and the children had a good time eating.
6. The hot springs are very comfortable. There are rose pools, milk pools, ginseng pools, and Eucommia pools, which meet the different needs of the family, which is very good.

msg:The second time I stayed there. The previous time was just average, but this time was even worse. The room must have been unoccupied for a long time. There was a strong smell as soon as I entered. The same thing happened in the other two rooms. A cat came into the room and meowed at around 2 a.m., which scared me. After I dealt with the cat, I found a big spider. I was the only one staying with three children. It was really scary in the middle of the night. Picture 1 was the meal we had packed up and put outside for the cat to mess up. Picture 2 was when we checked in and saw rat droppings on the chairs. Picture 3 was a big spider. I didn't take any pictures when the cat came in because I was scared to death.

msg:Mulian, just like the name, the environment of the hotel is quiet, cozy and comfortable. The gravel path + green plants are full of eyes, and it is especially enjoyable to walk casually after dinner. The hotel environment is quite big, but it is not far to walk, but as long as you don’t want to walk, just talk to the service staff or make a phone call, and within 2 minutes there will be a battery car to take you to the place you want to go. There are 2 swimming pools, both of which are not too big. One is relatively shallow and suitable for children, and various swimming rings and transparent boats can be rented. I booked a parent-child room, which is right next to the swimming pool. After swimming, I went back to the room to take a shower, and the swimming pool was closed after 9 p.m., so as not to disturb the children's sleep. The tent room looks pretty good, and I will try it next time when the weather is cooler. There are only two shortcomings. One is that the facilities are a little old. The other is the Yang Chinese restaurant, which is absolutely bad! The dishes are really mediocre. First of all, the taste of tea is 20 per person, and then there is a 15% service charge. I ate more than 600 for 4 home-cooked dishes. This is really not worth the price. Don’t go there.

The natural landscape is quite good, but the ratio of personnel is not equal, and the vegetation is not actively taken care of, so that it grows a bit barbaric. The hotel room is too well blocked to be seen. The hotel has a very distinctive tent hotel. Although the sparrow is small, it has all internal organs, and air-conditioned bathrooms are all available. The disadvantage of this kind of hotel is that walking in the garden at night is quite scary. Because the distance is far away, there are a lot of vegetation, and there are not many people, so don't go blind [Smile R] The room is very big, and there are a lot of mosquitoes. It is very good to look for mosquito coils and spray insecticide in the middle of the night. ! The service staff are very good. Ms. Wen only found out that I lost my ID card and sent it in time.

msg:The hotel is at the junction of Huadu East and Conghua. There are few farm dishes near the hotel, and it takes about 15 minutes to drive outside to eat.
The hotel was formerly known as the Sheraton Hotel. The room design style is quite good. The green rate of the entire hotel is extremely high, and it is very hot in summer.
The layout of the entire hotel is not very good, and it depends on the shuttle bus in the park (like the staff in charge of the shuttle bus). The hotel's hot spring is Mulian Qingquan. There are 9 hot spring pools. In summer, soak in hot water at 40°C. You can't stand it after soaking for less than half an hour. The hot spring is open from 3:00 pm to 11:00 pm. The hot spring pool is on the top of the mountain and needs to climb stairs, which is not very friendly to the elderly.
There are two open-air swimming pools in the hotel. The area is very uncomfortable. There are 3 transparent boats. The toilets in the swimming pools are relatively hidden and dark, so everyone changes in the room before going there.


Service: Satisfied until 10 o'clock the next day. but! At around 10 o'clock in the morning the next day, a staff member suddenly opened the door of our room with a card after knocking on the door a few times, saying that it was going to be disinfected. At that time, the TV in our room was still playing loud music! The whole person was frightened! Why can you open the guest room by yourself when the room is ringing without checking out! We do not accept the identity and any intention of the person who comes in! I hope your hotel can strengthen the training of such staff!


Breakfast: single, few choices.

Parking lot: Hotel parking access is the responsibility of other property companies. When checking in, they did not inform the parking lot access rules, nor did they take the initiative to indicate that the parking fee was charged. We drove out on the first day and were told that we need to pay without scanning the code. In order not to waste time turning back, we paid the parking fee.

The tent room is really nice, facing a creamy lawn, 100% shading, no light leakage from the tent affecting sleep, bathing is also very convenient, the water flow is very good, and the comfort is perfect. At night, sit on the wooden platform with the star lights on and sing and chat. Flying discs on the lawn during the day is really pleasant~

The hotel's own swimming pool and hot spring have been experienced, which is very good!

The decoration of the whole hotel has a strong Southeast Asian a**osphere, and the scenery is beautiful every step of the way. There are many frangipani trees planted. When I went there, it was in the flowering season, which was very beautiful.

The service is very good, the hotel area is very large, but there are golf cars for pick-up and drop-off everywhere, and the front desk is patient and considerate.

TIPS: It is less than 10 minutes away from the King Hotel, you can buy tickets to watch the sunset, it is so beautiful!

Sanitation is clean, but the room facilities are too old. The courtyard view room has a musty smell. I want to open the window to ventilate, and a room full of mosquitoes comes in.

The garden room is quite large, with a wide terrace, the huge bathtub is a bit mottled, the faucet in the shower room cannot be adjusted in temperature, and the maintenance master has been tossing all night and failed to fix it. The bathroom hot spring is 45 degrees +...

The service is hard to describe. The aunt who cleans, the elder sister of Mulian Qingquan, and the younger brother of the battery car are warm and thoughtful. The other hotel staff are neither hot nor cold, unlike the service attitude of Jiulong Lake next door, it is an experience that makes people feel at home.

Before May 1st, I called the front desk of Mulianzhuang and recommended me the package 599 on the hotel's official account. I bought two coupons and charged 680 on May 1st. Later, the front desk told me that I need to charge 680+400+200 per room, which is much more expensive than Ctrip**. I gave up and went back to the platform to book two rooms.

The front desk said that the coupons that have not been verified can be refunded. Later, I urged it many times, and went back and forth to find the front desk for three shifts, but they didn't deal with it. After a long time, someone contacted me and said that the coupon had expired (obviously stated that it can be purchased from April 1 to May 7), and I had to go through the group financial process, asking me to provide my certificate and card number, and refund within 30 days. This is 3 seconds to receive money, 30 days to refund...

We checked in after four o'clock in the afternoon, played board games, children's club, table tennis, hot springs, and a bonfire party, and played karting the next day

Generally speaking, the service is very good, and the battery car is on call, and I will go there next time.

But pay attention to contact in advance if you are going for the first time, because it is hard to find a place to check in

msg:It coincided with the Spring Festival cooling down, and the hot springs everywhere were full. Taking advantage of the rhythm of everyone’s return trip on the sixth day of the new year, we made reservations in time and set off.
🚗.·A 45-minute drive from downtown Guangzhou (no traffic jams along the way)

🛏️Room facilities:
The standard equipment is complete, and the interior decoration is relatively old
❌The most puzzling thing for me is that the shower in the bathroom🚿 is installed at a height of 1.9-2 meters⋯Go over the shower directly⋯The dripping water can’t stand⋯Who is it for? You can only take a shower with your hand (Room 523)
The phone in the room ☎️ is malfunctioning...cause it is really troublesome to keep in touch

Location and transportation: 🅿️ Parking is quite convenient, both indoors and outdoors

Swimming pool: 🏊🏻‍♀️🏊
❌Visual inspection of two outdoor swimming pools, but neither of them is filled with water, it is a decoration in winter

From the room to the hot spring area, you need to take the battery car in the park. Because the weather is so cold, you want to get into the water immediately when you arrive at the hot spring area. The changing room is relatively small
❌The bad comment is that you have to report the room number when you come in and out, but no one gives you a hand card. There is no locker in the changing room, and you have to go to the front desk to find someone to get the key card [sweating]

Go to the hot spring area and go into the water right away [laughing] It’s warm~~ There are very few people in the park (choosing the right time is very important) The scenery is also very good, with a Japanese style, but the temperature is not too high, and every pool is very clean, especially the milk pool . Because the weather is so cold, I don’t want to walk more pools [naughty]
❌Bad reviews mean that there is no one to serve you. You can change towels, get towels, and get water by yourself. You can say that there is no service, all self-service mode.
⚠️The hot spring pool is not hot enough, you can contact the waiter to heat it up! !

If it wasn’t so cold that day, it would have been very easy to take pictures, but I couldn’t handle the cold [Han Xiao]

The hot spring ♨️ pool is open from 3:30 pm to 23:00 every day
Even if you wake up in the morning and want to soak... this is very important‼ ️

msg:I have never stayed in this hotel before. This is the first time I checked in. When I went through the procedures at the front desk, I added the WeChat account of Manager Wu at the front desk. If there are any problems during check-in, I can communicate in time with any services I need. The environment is very good and quiet. The first time After exercising for two days, I took a shower in the room. There was no hot water in the middle, but Manager Wu changed the room for me to take a shower in time. The experience was good, and I will stay here next time.

msg:It used to be the Sheraton Hotel, and later became The Mulianzhuang. The overall feeling is like a resort hotel. There are several pools where you can soak in hot springs. Perhaps due to the relatively small number of guests, two of the six pools are closed, and the hot springs are only available at 3 p.m. It's just open, which is a bit weird.

msg:I rarely give 5 points. This time I was really surprised. I was a bit tired when I drove to the nearby area on a business trip. I found a nearby hotel on Ctrip. The main picture attracted me. Find it soon. As soon as I came in, I was pleasantly surprised by the environment. It is a villa hidden in the busy city, so I can sleep peacefully and have a good night's sleep. The guy at the front desk is very considerate. He upgraded the 20-square-meter room I booked to 60 square meters. It is a very smart decision to upgrade the room for the staff who are not all employees and are not very nervous. . Please write a good review for this smart, quiet and very green private garden hotel with a large and comfortable villa. See pictures for specific scenes. By the way, it's cloudy after the rain. If it's sunny, the pictures should be even more stunning.

3 The living environment as shown in the picture below is even more messy, the desktop is full of dust, and there are 2 sockets on the floor, which is extremely unsafe (for children). The air conditioner in the sleeping room keeps ringing...
Really disappointed, really disappointed for customers like me who come again. Hope the hotel can improve…

If it is summer, you can go back to the room to take a shower, then there is no problem. It's really embarrassing in winter. There are not many varieties of breakfast, but it is barely ok.

It is very unsafe. Then to go to the hotel swimming pool and restaurant, you have to use their car. The stools and tables next to the swimming pool are extremely dirty. And the way to the hot spring at night is scary. It is dark and you can't see the road. You have to use the light of your mobile phone to light the way. When soaking in the massage pool, you can clearly smell the smell of dead rats. It is really the management that is checked to the extreme.

The episode was that I wanted to borrow a pair of scissors to cut something, and I discussed asking the waiter to bring a wine knife, and return it immediately when it was used up. The front desk and the male waiter who were on duty at night said that the hotel did not have scissors, so I laughed helplessly when I wrote this! How can it be so inflexible?
The place where the spring water takes up a small area, there are several commonly heard pools, and the environment is very good.
Didn't eat breakfast, so can't comment.

msg:The hotel has high privacy, and the garden design and greening maintenance are good. I have been here two or three times, and the service is satisfactory. There are very few tourists traveling during the epidemic, almost all places are reserved, and the travel comfort is high. But there are three fly in the oin**ent. The first catering service should not reduce the business hours due to the lack of customers. Breakfast until 10 o'clock is rare for all star-rated resort hotels at home and abroad. Since the guests are on vacation, how can they go to nine Wake up to dinner at five? So much so that I didn't even eat breakfast for the two days I stayed for two nights! Second, there are still problems with catering. At present, there is only one Chinese restaurant open for lunch and dinner, and the dinner ends at 8 o'clock. Basically, after taking a bath in the hot spring in the evening, the meal time is over, so that we did not have a meal on the first night. For food, there are almost no takeaways around, and it is not convenient to drive out at night to look for food with a four-year-old child. It is hoped that the catering arrangement is the hotel's hardware support. Although the occupancy rate is low, as long as there is one guest, the supporting services should be set up in consideration of the guest's dining convenience and actual needs. Thirdly, in the upgraded villa with double bed in the courtyard, water and electricity equipment repairs occurred in the middle of the repair, which caused the water to be yellow for a long time before and after the repair, and the unfiltered yellow water was basically visible to the naked eye, causing trouble in bathing. This hotel is a must-visit place for our family to travel every year. It is not far away and the children's playground is well equipped. We just hope to improve the above points.

Queue to the lobby for check-in fifteen minutes in advance, and the battery car will be quickly delivered to the door of the room. The advantage of the hotel is to experience the tent area and the hot spring area. The service attitude of the staff is generally good. The battery car is always on call. There is a small swimming pool and a simple playground for children to play. You can watch the stars while grilling, which is a good parent-child experience. The areas that need to be improved are that some tents that have not been renovated are old, the mosquito nets and sheets have holes, and the water quality of the swimming pool is a bit dirty. There is also a Chinese restaurant that charges ridiculously high prices. The lobby also charges a 15% service charge. Ordering six or seven ordinary dishes pays more than 1,200 yuan (it may be 700 yuan to find them in Bingsheng), and the dishes are generally salty. The variety of breakfast is average. The western pastry for breakfast is a little long, and the croissants are soft. The auntie who wrote the room number in the restaurant has a fierce look and attitude. The running account is written here, and overall it is worth a visit.

During the National Day, a lot of people went there, and they waited for a long time to check in, and the check-in was delayed. Originally my friend was very angry, but manager Tan Wenwen came out to meet us for communication and we were satisfied with the final result.
Overall, the hotel environment is very good, surrounded by vegetation, full of holiday style and fresh air. I like the courtyard where we stayed in the room the most. It has a Japanese style of wabi-sabi, and the privacy is also very good. The hotel is equipped with multiple hot spring pools, swimming pools, and tents are also good.
I hope that the hotel will strengthen the maintenance of hardware facilities in the future, and will choose to stay if there is a chance. Finally, I would like to thank Manager Tan Wenwen for his active handling!

Both of them are very good. I like this hotel very much. The becky service at the front desk is warm and friendly. He patiently listened to my feedback and gave feedback to the superiors. I hope that the next time you come to stay, it will be better in all aspects.

The hotel is very large, with two swimming pools, hot springs, gymnasiums and other recreational facilities. There are also special ferry cars in the hotel. The only downside is that some facilities are not well maintained. Overall good, worth recommending.

msg:A family comes for a parent-child tour. It feels like a resort. The environment is very beautiful and green, but there are also many mosquitoes. It is necessary to take anti-mosquito measures. For those who come here with swimming pools and hot springs, first of all, the hot springs are open from 3:00 pm to 11:00 pm, and will not be open the next morning. This is a bit unsatisfactory compared to other hot spring hotels that are open 24 hours a day. After all, it charges 88 yuan per one. People, you can only soak in the same day at most, and you have to wait until three o'clock after checking out the next day? Some are not reasonable. The hot spring has about 7-8 pools, 2 swimming pools, and a children's pool for small children. There is a battery car pick-up service in and out, but there is nothing to eat around. There are Chinese and Western restaurants in the hotel, which can be produced, but a 15% service fee will be charged. The so-called children's play area is really bad. The space is airtight and smells bad. The toys are messy and dirty all over the floor. I don't even dare to let my children play. It is recommended to strengthen hygiene.

The shuttle bus is very timely and you don't have to wait for a long time. Overall, it is very good. This time I went in a hurry and the weather was too hot. It was a yellow high temperature warning that day, so I didn't go to the hot spring and I will try it next time.

msg:Environment: The environment is a little more remote, and there is no place to eat around.

I played in the past on August 7, the environment is really good, the trees are shady, and it feels a bit Southeast Asian. What I like most is the large swimming pool of the hotel. The water quality is clear and clean, and the movies are also first-class. Take a walk in the hotel, take a breath of fresh air, and feel refreshed.

Okay, let's talk about the bad

Service: The service is a little bit behind. I make calls to the front desk and the switchboard, and often no one answers the line. The service of the battery car, many times I called a car, but the car did not come...
I booked a total of 3 rooms, and two of them were available to me at 3:30... But the lobby manager also allowed me to delay the check-out time the next day.

Hardware: The 3 rooms I booked are all twin-bedded rooms with lake views. The bathroom I stayed in was both broken [cover your face] [cover your face] [cover your face], really speechless... Later, the lobby manager also helped me for free Upgraded room type. The attitude and service of the lobby manager to deal with the incident is OK.

Summary: General service, outdated hardware facilities. Hope to improve the service in the future. At the most basic level, I think that the telephones at the switchboard and the front desk must be answered by someone. As for the facilities, I hope the hotel can also overhaul it.

msg:Expectations are too high, there is still a big gap compared to five stars
[Hardware] It can be seen that the new opening stage should be very good. The outdoor hardware and green plants are well maintained, but the room is obviously insufficient, and the wooden floor and sliding door have obvious problems.
[Service] The biggest problem is the service. We arrived at two o'clock, but it was not until 4:30 that the room was cleaned and the room was opened. There were many adults and children waiting for the guests in the lobby, which was a very poor experience. The dinner buffet is also obviously insufficient in terms of catering supply capacity. The variety is acceptable in the resort area, and there is still a gap compared with the normal five-star.

It is worth affirming the characteristic tents and water leisure, this price is not bad.

There is a wall outside the window, and the garden cannot be seen at all. This is the garden view room! It's a room with a wall view! There are two swimming pools, which is different from the pictures on the Internet, and the water quality is very poor. Only the hotel knows how long it has not been washed and changed (I remind the hotel that your water quality publicity board has not been changed for a long time). The hot spring doesn't open until 3:00 in the afternoon. It's a good thing if the water is changed and cleaned! But when I went there at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, it doesn't matter if the pond has a large area of leaves, it is impossible to say if there are insects, and there are ants everywhere around the pond! Although there are dissatisfaction, but the hotel staff are polite and service worthy of recognition, but other... 😡

Because we were too hungry, we went to the western restaurant to order something to eat. The portion is quite large and the taste is not bad. We have a small appetite, and this price is really high. After going to the room to rest and tidy up, we went to the hot spring. The next day, I hurried to have a breakfast before receiving the meal. Both Chinese and Western food were available, so I was not afraid of difficulty in choosing. Several students had a great time this time.

Said to upgrade the room for us but it is not by the swimming pool. I booked this room for the convenience of children to play in the water. I asked to change the room near the swimming pool, and told that there was no change. How can I arrange check-in if the room facilities and equipment are bad? Without the slightest apology, it seemed like a gift to upgrade. Called the battery car for half an hour and no one answered, and finally walked by myself. The battery car masters are very enthusiastic and the service is the best. Coming here means no one cares about you.

msg:🍃Environment: The hotel has high green coverage and is relatively quiet 🤫It looks good in the morning, but at night the lights on the roadside only provide enough brightness to not let people fall, and the rest is dark and gloomy. The decoration is not well maintained, and many parts have seen obvious aging. The air conditioner is not cold, and some of the electric curtains are broken. The ceiling of the room will leak on rainy days ~ the room is confused by the electric switch, and other hotels have a one-key sleep mode.
🧹Hygiene: Visual inspection is ok, no obvious stains.
🔔Service: This is really lacking. There are many battery cars in the whole hotel, but unfortunately there is only one staff member driving the car. It is conceivable that the workload of the staff is heavy, and the waiting time for the guests is very long. Especially in the recent rainy days, I really need a car to travel. Stayed for two nights in total. After breakfast on the 9th, the power was cut off when I came back to the room. The room was stuffy after the power cut. The first time I called the front desk to ask how to deal with it, the front desk said it knew but did not say how to follow up. In the end, it was only after calling many times that they said they would change rooms; but there was no exact time, so I asked for a reply. After confirming the room change, let the guests wait for 20 minutes in the rainstorm before coming to change the room. The whole process was very unpleasant, I came this holiday to celebrate my birthday, and finally left in anger. The entire staff did not apologize.

I didn't go to the hot springs, and there was a bigger swimming pool that I didn't take pictures of.
The last two are children's playgrounds, unmaintained
The breakfast is rich and tasty
The overall feeling can go once

msg:The environment is very cost-effective in all aspects, because the two families arranged adjacent rooms for free upgrades for convenience. Because the location of the room was only after 5 o'clock in the innermost park, there was no light at all for some reason. The breakfast is remarkable. I bought the afternoon tea and didn't enjoy it due to time problems. In addition, I would like to give some small comments. Before leaving, the hygiene of the children's park was not in place. There is also a serious problem. The aroma smell is so big that adults can't wait. I was very worried that the child would feel uncomfortable after inhaling it, so I quickly left after 10 minutes. Overall it is worth to stay again, recommend

msg:I often come to this hotel and like it very much. I booked a deluxe room next to the big swimming pool. If I wanted to swim, I only opened another swimming pool, which is a little regrettable. But the overall service is quite satisfactory, the front desk service is warm, the hot spring is also very comfortable, and the rose pool milk pool won my heart! In the summer vacation, wait until the big swimming pool is open before bringing the children here. The battery car is very convenient, and it is always on call! The food in the Chinese restaurant is super delicious! Recommended protein fried rice, soy sauce chicken, beef with double peppers, beef with sour soup, super rice! During the stay, BECKY introduced the play strategy in detail, and after checking out, I learned about the check-in experience, thank BECKY for its meticulous service.

msg:Forest Hotel, a bit of the immediate sense of the hotel in the community. The entrance is the villa area, and the back is the hotel. The rooms are scattered, and there will be a battery car to send to the hotel. Each building is not high, 2 floors, the design is very special, but because the vegetation is too rich, the light is not enough, the light in the room is not good, and there is a musty smell
The design of the guest room is very good. There is a toilet and a cloakroom in the door next to the bed. Part of the floor of the toilet is stone and patterned, so you don't have to be afraid of slipping.
The hot spring is on the mountain, climb the stairs up. The hot spring part is so disappointing. There are a total of 9 pools, which are not big. When we went there in the afternoon on the first day, there were still 3 pools under maintenance, and one was a cold pool, so we could only soak in one pool, which was no fun. Went again the next morning and soaked in a milk pool
The water in the swimming pool next to the lobby is cold, it is very cold for children to play, and the trees are blocked, the sun can't shine, and the water is difficult to warm
Dinner at a Chinese restaurant in the evening, the product is very good, but it is more expensive. Well, being expensive isn't his fault, it's mine.
The playability is not high, the children have been calling it not fun, there are so few hot springs, and there are no amu*****t facilities. The parent-child hotel does not know where the name came from. It may be suitable for young couples paralyzed in the hotel to watch TV, talk about love, not suitable for old mothers to let the baby discharge

msg:1. It may be a weekday trip. For the first time, I saw an empty hotel with no waiter at the entrance of the hotel, no reception in the lobby, and only one front desk. I arrived at night, a little...
2. There are a lot of termites in the room, which are either moving or rotten. Even if there are some on the floor, it is enough for me to turn out a lot of broken wings on the bed, and the dust accumulation above the headrest of the bed is serious.
3. Fighting with mosquitoes at night until early morning, killing three or two has not done its best.
4. u1s1, the outdoor green environment of the hotel is OK, it is estimated that the main focus is hot springs, and the open world is 15-23 points.

msg:I traveled with the elderly and children on weekends and chose a tent room.
advantage:
Freshness, for those who do not have the conditions to go camping, it is quite pleasant to experience it occasionally.
The environment is good, I have to say that the environment here is really beautiful.
The breakfast was delicious and rich.
shortcoming:
No stars! No stars! No stars!
Mosquitoes are impossible to live without. There are so many mosquitoes that the air conditioner was adjusted to 17°C for an hour before mosquitoes dared to let the baby in.
The park shouted that the battery car took a long time to come, and we all went straight after.
The hot spring actually starts at 3:00 and ends at 11:00, which means that if you don't go to soak the night you stay, you can't soak the next day.
The tent room is a bit shabby, and a lot of moldy, a bit sorry for the price.
The facilities are a bit small. There are some facilities in the lobby. After swimming, there are no towels in the shower.
There are fewer waiters.
Summarize:
But still, 1399 a night is slightly expensive. Tent is not recommended, you can try other rooms.

msg:There is only one advantage, the hotel itself has a good environment, and the layout of vegetation is patchwork, just like the residential design of the high-end villa area. It is still very comfortable to sit in the shade of the tree and rest on the plank road near the lake at the Chinese restaurant. I sent a hot spring ticket but didn't go. The holiday must be overcrowded, and I really have no interest in walking around in many pools in China and wearing swimsuits. The hamburgers and Hainanese chicken rice in the western restaurant are ok.
Then there are the slots:
1. The occupancy rate is high during the Qingming holiday. You have to queue for a while before you can check in. At that time, it was said that the villa had not been cleaned, and when it was ready, it would be notified by phone to receive the room card. As a result, we went to the western restaurant for lunch and walked for a walk until 3:30. We called the front desk and said that it wasn’t all right, so I’ll inform you again. I couldn’t bear to walk outside until 4:00, so I rushed to the front desk to ask. What's going on? The receptionist said indifferently that the room was ready, so why don't you call me? !
2. There should be a concierge person on the side of the door. I didn't know anything when I asked him, and he didn't respond when I told him to store my luggage. Finally, I took it to the front desk to store it myself. There are many family trips during the holidays, and there are many children in the public area, so it is very noisy.
3. Room facilities: The villa is built by the lake, the location of the terrace swimming pool has sunk a little, and there are cracks and drops from the house itself. The water in the swimming pool has not been changed, and the fallen leaves and other sundries have not been salvaged, and the feet are so dirty that they do not want to put them in. The audio cable is in poor contact and the CD-ROM drive is off. It is said that there is a battery car that can be connected by phone and sent to other areas of the hotel, but the phone has not been found. Finally, under the guidance of the hotel, I found a desk that looks like a closet that can be opened. I saw a phone there, but it was useless. No one will ever answer the phone at the front desk. We can only use our mobile phone to make hotel landline calls. Fortunately, the villa we live in is very close to the restaurant, so it's okay to walk around.
There is a 2-3cm high platform outside the bed frame of the queen bed. What is it for? In order to trip you and me, he didn't trip me, but let me kick my toes up and hurt my toes. The cloakroom is also wonderful. The mirror on the dressing table is so high that people can only take a picture of their upper body when they are standing, and they can't see the top of their head when they sit down. There are three small gaps from the room to the cloakroom to the bathroom, and it is easy to fall if you are not careful. If the glass door of the toilet cannot be pushed inward, it will be stuck by the toilet. Every time you go in, you have to go in sideways and close the door before you can sit down. The sink is already 15cm away from the edge of the table, and a 5cm towel rack is installed, so you have to bend over to use the sink. The stopper of the bathtub is also broken and needs to be stuck at a special angle before it can be used. The water from the faucet is yellow. This room has not been used for a long time due to the epidemic. The water that has been left for more than ten minutes is still yellow. to soak.
4. The breakfast is even more exaggerated. I was so shocked that I forgot to take pictures. There were no cold cuts of meat and cheese, and the variety was so small that I thought I would travel to Home Inn to give breakfast.
5. The most shocking thing is that after breakfast, before 11 o'clock, my wife was standing in the yard enjoying the lake view in a bathrobe. I was taking a shower in the bathroom, and a group of staff suddenly rushed in from the sidewalk of the yard, ready to be cleaned. Yard and pool! ! ! We haven't checked out and it's not yet time to check out. This house is our private use time. Even if there is a guest who needs to clean it, we should ring the doorbell from the door. Like home, spread out in the surrounding courtyard. After I took a shower, I quickly put on my clothes, called to complain, and it's been a month now, and I have nothing to say.

The environment is not bad, very comfortable, no P pictures. How should I put it, they can do as many things as you give them. We have stayed in Congdu for several thousand and one nights, and they must be meticulous star-level service. They charge a room fee of 1,000 and several hundred, and they can’t ask them for it. There is a five-star service from Congdu, but it is also responsive, that is, the neighborhood is relatively remote, so you can bring some snacks or fruits. The baby is also having a good time, the air is also good, it is a good deal!

The vegetation in the hotel is very good, and the air is much better than the urban area. The guest rooms are separate villas, and there is no elevator. This pregnant woman was not very friendly, but the personalized service from the front desk and the concierge made up for it. First of all, the front desk checked me in to see that I was pregnant, took me a chair and sat down to check in, and specially arranged for me to have no stairs. The accessible rooms are very convenient for restaurants and entertainment, and the lighting and ventilation are also very good. After checking in, the concierge’s little brother took me to the room. It was raining that day. The little brother helped me hold the umbrella with one hand and the luggage with the other, for fear of getting the baby in my belly wet and half of myself My shoulders were all wet. This time the stay experience was perfect. Although the weather was bad, the thoughtful reception and warm and friendly service from the little brothers and sisters in the hotel did not affect my mood to play at all. Thanks to the little brothers and sisters who have also contributed to the front-line positions during the special period.

msg:🌟Highlight Features:
The Mulian Hotel Huadu is a typical weekend resort hotel. The hotel was built and operated by Hejing, a local development company in Guangzhou, and has been in business for more than ten years. The distance away from the hustle and bustle but not far from the urban area, the scattered villa room layout, and the super-dense forest green coverage are the three major features of the hotel. Although some equipment is aging or damaged due to the construction time, the overall experience is still worthy of praise.

✅Must experience 1⃣: Starry Night Tent Room + Outdoor BBQ
✅Must experience 2⃣: Qingquan (hot spring) pool

🍲Recommended dishes: Experienced the dinner set and breakfast at the hotel's western restaurant. The overall taste is still good, but there is still some gap between the first-line brands.

💰 Per capita consumption: Room 900-1500 (including breakfast), dinner per capita 100.

🚉Traffic strategy: The hotel is located in the north of the airport, in the eastern section of Shanqian Tourism Avenue in Huadu District. It can only be reached by car. It is estimated that it will take 40-80 minutes in the urban area of Guangzhou.

As soon as we arrived at the front desk, Brother Aniu at the front desk upgraded us to a garden view room for free. Miss Su and Miss Wen also welcomed us very warmly. The service was great. Although it is a pity that only three hot spring pools have been opened, the quality of the hot spring pools that have been opened is also very high, and the staff will warmly bring us hot tea, which is a good choice for travel. The price of the restaurant is also acceptable, and the dishes and services are also quite good, and if you need anything, you can get help in time, especially suitable for a place to relax on weekends and holidays.

msg:First of all, the air quality is very good, full of negative ions and the fragrance of plants and trees; the products in the Zhongdian Hall are also quite high. When I first went there, I thought there were few people and the products would be discounted. The attitude of the staff in all positions is very serious and enthusiastic, and they patiently answer or solve my problems. The bad part is the room facilities. I thought that the slightly more expensive room would be more comfortable. It is not applicable here. First of all, the washbasin leaks. I had to hold my breath to go to the bathroom and take a shower, and it stinks me all night with the two doors of the bathroom closed. In addition, the smell of bleaching powder in tap water is also very serious, and bottled water must be used for gargling. After my feedback, the hotel offered to help me change rooms, but it was already past nine o'clock in the evening, so I didn't want to toss, after all, the distance between each room was not too short. Hope the hotel will strengthen the maintenance work.

I stayed for two nights in a row, and the cleaning supplies that should have been replenished during the next day's hygiene were not replenished, and the drinks at the bar were also not replenished. I'm not too picky about making up others, I just want to let it go! This kind of service restaurant charges 15% 5-star fee, but it really does not meet the standard!

The service provided by the manager of the western restaurant in the hotel was very good. The kitchen misplaced the dishes at dinner, and the manager immediately sent two salads. The breakfast is rich and the dishes are delicious, which is in line with the standard of a five-star hotel. Although the hotel's hot spring is not big, it is better than the clean water and quiet environment. The dressing room is small and needs to be improved. The hardware facilities of the hotel room are a little old, and the cleaning service needs to be improved. The overall feeling is good, a pleasant holiday experience.

msg:The hotel environment is very comfortable, the Southeast Asian garden design, the low-density room after the renovation of the single-family villa, and the privacy is very good. The front desk has upgraded the lake view room, which is great! There is a battery car in and out, and it will arrive within 5 minutes, but it is actually more comfortable to walk. Every flower and grass are carefully trimmed, and the air is full of negative ions! The hot spring I went to soak in at night, the pool is not much, but it is big enough, and there is ginger tea and fruit supply. The buffet breakfast is ok, with a score of 90. The only downside is that the coffee is served with milk instead of creamer balls. The coffee with milk is easy to get cold. There is also a great room. 60 square meters is enough for a family of four activities. It is recommended to upgrade the toiletries to improve the grade. Looking forward to going to the swimming pool again in summer, the swimming pool looks very good.

🍃Environment: It feels relatively quiet, the hotel is not big, it feels like it is built on the middle of the mountain, the facilities are scattered, and you need to use a battery car to move.
🧹Sanitation: The room is big and clean. But there is a very strong smell similar to the lobby. It kept me awake all night. And the bathroom smells a bit off. Details need to be enhanced
🔔Service: The staff are friendly. There are not many hot spring pools, but they are small and refined. The water temperature is around 39-40°C, which is very comfortable. But there are no dry towels outside the pool, and there is only one concentrated water bar. In the hotel I have stayed in before, there are dry towels that can be replaced after a few steps. So we can only drape from start to finish with a damp towel.
Overall, it's quite enjoyable, and I didn't step on the thunder.

msg:First of all, I am very grateful to the front desk for helping us upgrade the room, and I am also very grateful to the staff who stick to their posts during the Spring Festival. However, I have to say that the smell of the sewer in the room is very strong, but because the room is full, it cannot be replaced. The hotel has a certain age, which is understandable. But the most unsatisfactory is the hot spring facilities! I have never seen any hot spring park without towels, only the locker room has towels, and according to the staff's explanation, there is a lot of tourists during the Spring Festival, and some guests have several towels, so there are not enough towels. However, at 8 or 9 o'clock at night, on rainy days, and in the deep mountains, the weather is already very cold (the body temperature is only six or seven degrees). Isn't it normal for guests to use more towels? In winter, isn't it normal to change the towel when it's wet? Finally, I was accused by the staff when I used a towel to wipe my hair and a towel to wipe my body! As a guest, I spend thousands of dollars for a night. Is it okay to use multiple towels? It should be that the hotel has made adequate preparations for the shortage of towels during the Spring Festival, rather than asking guests to help the hotel save towels! Service attitude is worrying! In addition, the women's locker room is very small. It is a place to change clothes as soon as you enter the door. There is no curtain to block it. As long as someone enters and leaves, it will feel colder. There is a service staff standing there, and I feel very uncomfortable. Add a half curtain to the cabinet! Third, the hooks for hanging clothes in the bathroom are straight, and they cannot hang clothes and towels at all, especially wet clothes and towels, which is very inconvenient! Without good service, customer satisfaction cannot be achieved, how can customer loyalty be discussed? I hope the hotel management can personally experience the service of the hotel. As one of the few entertainment facilities in this hotel, the hot springs need to be improved too much!

On weekdays when there were not many people, there were not many people in the hotel lobby. We were checked in by a wave of people at the front desk, one male and one female waiter. They checked in for us together, answered our questions patiently, and told us that we were VIPs. They upgraded the Garden Superior Double Room. The BECKY at the front desk of the hotel, Xiaowen's service is very warm and worthy of praise, and it is the second place in the low occupancy rate. Days, also gave us a late check out. The sanitation in the room is very clean. There is a battery car pick-up service in the hotel park. Unlike the reviews that wait for a long time, it basically takes 5 minutes to arrive. There is a battery car pick-up service at the entrance of the hotel. The check-in process is simple and fast, unlike others who say that there is no one in the lobby. The overall stay is very satisfactory, we are not the first time here, they always provide excellent service to the guests, which left a good impression on us. Next time we have the opportunity, we will choose to stay at The Mulian Hotel, and we will introduce our friends and relatives to experience the beautiful and comfortable hotel environment and five-star service.

msg:On the weekend after the burden was reduced, it was rare for the children not to be interested in the class, so they took the children to play in Guangzhou.
Colleagues recommended this hotel, but reminded that if there are too many people, problems can easily occur.
Considering the reason of bringing children, my colleague suggested that when placing an order, I should make "requests" with the hotel front desk and live in Buildings 1-3, so that I can be closer to the hotel front desk and the swimming pool.
I drove to the hotel at 2 o'clock in the afternoon on Saturday, and I felt like I came to the property attached hotel.
The parking lot is divided into open-air and indoor spaces, but basically it can only be parked outdoors.
There is no one in line at the front desk (as I told my colleagues, there are crowds of people on Sundays during summer vacation, which is a real difference). Check in quickly. Special commendation to Ms. Su Lixia at the front desk for taking the initiative to help keep the handbag "lost" for a while.
The hotel is built on the mountain, and you need a battery car to get in and out. Because there are not many people on Saturdays, it is convenient to take a car.
The first impression of the hotel is that it is quiet.
I booked a garden-view twin room, the room is on the third floor (but there is no elevator), because Building 1-3 is close to the hotel reception and the main swimming pool, so you don’t need to take a battery car, you can walk directly.
The room is so big, the floor height is more than 3.5 meters, and there is also a bathtub, children can play in it, electric curtains, children can also play. The beds can be combined, and the sofa can also be made into a bed, which is very good. Free soda is provided in the refrigerator.
Because I ordered a set meal, it includes afternoon drinks and dinner.
The restaurant is downstairs at the front desk, and the children’s playground, fitness room and small swimming pool are all next to the restaurant. In addition to the wave pool in the children’s playground, children’s favorites are also manual football tables. Of course, for 2-year-olds, it is more fun without open simulated driving (because you can play with the steering wheel).
The afternoon drink is two glasses of soda.
On Saturday, dinner was a buffet, and the height of the two children did not meet the requirements for making up money. There are not many people in the restaurant, and it is quiet. The products are all ordinary ingredients, but it is better than being quiet, allowing adults and children to taste it slowly.
The hot spring needs to take a battery car to go to the opposite of the parking lot. According to the driver of the battery car, the hotel was formerly the Hilton Hotel, no wonder the layout pays so much attention to quietness. The hot spring is connected to the camping area. The hot spring is not big, but there are not many people, so it is quiet. In the clear soup pool, you can see the people grilling in the camping area, as well as the laughter of the children in the outdoor children's playground.
Breakfast is relatively crowded, but it is not too noisy, and the products are also common ingredients.
Of course, children’s favorite is to play in the main swimming pool. Although there is no slide, it is good for self-entertainment. And because it is close to the room, you can check out until 11:30.
Summary: The hotel takes quietness as its biggest selling point, which is especially suitable for couples or young couples. But the surrounding areas are all villas, so it is not convenient to eat out (you can order takeaways). If you don't drive by car, it will be really hard to come here.
As for the service, it depends on whether there are many guests when checking in. Of course, the service is good if there are not many.
I personally feel that this is a hotel that can stay in again without too many people. I especially like its quiet and good environment.

It is a pity that there was a problem with the hotel's telephone system that day, and it was not possible to call a car. It was very inconvenient without a car, because the battery car was used to pick up and drop off everywhere!

Here is a special commendation to the driver, Mr. Fu Wen, who took the initiative to provide us with his own phone, and promptly pick up and drop off wherever we go. The sense of service is so good, and the guests are anxious. In order to protect the reputation of the hotel, it is really good to have such employees. ! ! Leave a message to like Master Wen👍

But I feel very good after the check-in experience~
When it was just right, there was no one in the big swimming pool and hot spring.
The feeling of chartering is simply not too good!
The greening of the environment is excellent,
The body and mind are really relaxed here~
As long as a phone call, there is a battery to drive you to the area you want to go,
Very thoughtful~
The breakfast and dinner buffets are not as good as the legendary big names, but they are quite outstanding.
Although far away from the business district, it’s not boring at all in the hotel’s park.
Soaking in hot springs and swimming are both fun~
The moon at night is also very charming,
You can still see fireflies on the way back to the room!
Spent a beautiful weekend~
Ps, the bed is a bit too soft,
I felt a piece collapsed in the middle,
Waking up, the whole waist was sore,
And the room facilities are still some years old,
The curtains cannot be opened,
The toilet board did not slow down,
But overall it's pretty good~

This time there was a thunderstorm, and there was a small episode. Manager Xia helped to deal with it. It was very comfortable. Although the rain did not affect our mood of bathing in the hot springs, it is different to take an umbrella and soak in the hot springs on rainy days. The large balcony of the room. It has a wide field of vision, sanitation and cleanliness, haha, I have posted a circle of friends and many people want to come. It is highly recommended. It is recommended that if the hotel adds a small yellow car, tourists can choose to ride by themselves, or it can increase the fun, which can reduce the waiting for the pick-up and drop process, but also Reduce the number of pick-ups and drop-offs using the hotel battery car. Travel in an environmentally friendly way, and enjoy riding, looking forward to the hotel's complete equipment and better performance! Will come again next time!

msg:I was very satisfied with this hotel 🏨You can swim in two swimming pools during the day and soak in a hot spring at night ♨️But there was an episode in the two-day stay that affected the whole stay experience! I did buy a three-day-two-night garden-view double room package. On the first day I checked in, I asked the front desk if it could be changed to a double bed? The front desk agreed to arrange a double bed for me (because the baby likes to kick the quilt and the double bed is suitable for sleeping with the baby after all, it is better to suffer one person than two) but suddenly the front desk called me the next afternoon and asked us to change the room immediately. I bought a double bed room. We thought it was because of the different money... But she said that the same money was only sold for twin beds. If this is the case, you shouldn't change the room for me on the first day. When it was raining heavily, our family of three felt that it was difficult to walk, twisting our luggage and waiting for the shuttle bus to take us to change rooms. As a result, I changed from building 3 at the foot of the mountain to building 5 at the top of the mountain... The most damning thing is that although the hotel really has a free shuttle bus, but frankly speaking, the front desk phone is always busy and the line cannot be reached. When the reception desk turned around, there was a busy tone again. So I couldn't accept changing to the top of the mountain. After all, it was very difficult to go down the mountain with the kids without a shuttle bus. In the end, I got into the lobby and got angry before I changed to 2 rooms that were close to each other. But I was even more speechless when I went to the room 🤦🏻‍♂️The so-called big bed is two single beds put together. If so, why didn't they just separate this bed for the new residents? Why let us toss? And I had to wait for half an hour with one bag and two bags. Really embarrassed... It greatly affected my staying experience this time. It’s even more funny at night, saying that the restaurant was reserved. The western set meal we ordered was upgraded to a buffet. Originally, I was secretly happy that the result was similar to which cheap hot spring group buffet breakfast. My original western set meal was also purchased as an add-on. It turned out to be so speechless. 🤦🏻‍♂️

Traffic 🍀: 1 hour from the city to arrive. It is recommended to avoid Friday-Saturday if possible. First, no traffic jams, and second, there are slightly fewer people.
To
Check-in 🍀: The normal check-in time is after 15:00. If you arrive early on the same day, you have to check in in advance because you happen to have a room. The breakfast and the opening hours of the hot springs will also be explained clearly, which is more humane. After taking the room card, there will be a battery car at the door to the room
To
Environment 🍀: The hotel has a relatively wide land area, and the facilities for play are relatively single, mostly concentrated near the lobby. However, the garden is surrounded by greenery and jungle, with lush branches and relatively fresh air, which is definitely a good place to relax.

Staying in Room 3006 this time was like returning to nature, but I was surprised to see fireflies. The tent room is stylish and elegant, and the bedding is extremely comfortable. However, there is no small refrigerator. In the early morning, there are people outside chatting and laughing in the outdoor game. They can't sleep at ease, and they are woken up by wild cats many times in the middle of the night. People with high sleep requirements should choose carefully.

But the air-conditioning in this room didn’t work, and I didn’t change it. Change rooms for us. I carried the child with a pile of luggage, and first changed me to a ba*****t with a lot of musty. I disagreed, and then I changed to a garden room outside with low-grade air-conditioning. I don't agree, and finally tossed until almost seven o'clock before changing to the room! But we were too angry and tired. Although we were given fruits and breakfast coupons, the experience was really bad! ! ! The service of the battery car brother is still available, and he has been walking around with us. Originally wanted to stay for two days but also cancelled, will not come again!

msg:Take the children on vacation and choose the Mulianzhuang Hotel in Huadu, which is closer to Guangzhou. It only takes an hour to arrive from Guangzhou. You can check in a 60m room with extra money. The room is relatively spacious but relatively old, and the carpets in the room feel dirty. One change is better, because it leaves at noon and arrives in the afternoon a bit hungry. There are no other options nearby to eat and the shops are far away, so the hotel is directly solved by the western restaurant. The price is too high and a 15% service fee is charged. This is a bit unreasonable. The most satisfying thing is that the forest-like open-air swimming pool is very comfortable, and the whole is good, but it is very casual, and the surrounding area is not big.

msg:The hot springs are clean and Japanese-style; the Chinese restaurant in the hotel has good taste and there are not many people; the breakfast variety is good; there are gyms, table tennis, and swimming pools.
The hotel's hardware facilities are good, a typical resort hotel. The room feels more hygienic. I am allergic to dust, and I don’t feel clean after entering the room.

msg:我們一共7間房，住了兩天，整體大家都很滿意，
我們的行程是住該酒店，泡温泉，再去融創滑雪，再回酒店住。
裝修和環境：裝修不錯，園林設計也很好，酒店依山而建，佈局錯落有致，以水為主題，有湖，有温泉，有泳池，分為幾個不同的房間區域，早上散步很好，空氣很清新。
服務：服務滿分，無論是在大堂、餐廳、房間還是公共區域，服務人員呈現的服務態度都令人倍感舒服。服務意識都很強👍。小周管家，前台辦理入住的小温，還有主管Michale，都很及時有效的服務，電瓶車隨叫隨到（高峯期等一會），所有人員服務評價五星級！
餐食：早餐種類很豐富，補充食物和收拾餐具都很迅速，粉面粥、炒菜、西點、咖啡飲料水果很多種類選擇，特別還有豉汁蒸鳳爪，這個是在很多五星級酒店早餐都沒有的菜式，做的不比茶樓差，值得點贊！我們過年時間去的，住了兩天人很多，也沒有出現混亂的情況。附近有很多農家菜，價格都不貴，份量也足。不過衹做中午飯和晚餐，沒有夜宵。
温泉和遊樂園：温泉池不多，不過完全夠了，而且過年期間服務人員也很充足，這個難得可貴！我看評論有些人抱怨池子少，這總觀點完全就是太叫矯情！遊樂園小孩子玩的很開心，一玩就能玩兩三個小時。
房間：房間很大，陽台也很大，裝修保養的不錯！衞生收拾的很乾凈，第二天也會直接打掃房間，出去玩完回來房間馬上變得乾淨整齊。
不足之處：酒店內部有些地方燈光太暗，比如29棟大堂門口，建議多增加點草地燈、景觀燈，度假村小孩子多，燈光多一點也安全一點。酒店晚上好像沒有宵夜提供，餐飲都停了，如果有承包商可以入駐酒店增加宵夜就好了，因為酒店外部很荒涼，完全沒有任何商家，晚上餓了或者想整點下酒菜很不方便，我們是開車去五公里以外的鎮上買的宵夜。

msg:1. 酒店的規模很大型很多房間，需要用到高爾夫車接送行李或者到其他地方，但是在地下車庫的地方比較難叫車，而且有時候也要等蠻久的。
2. 房間很大可是有點舊了，該更新的還是要更新一下，而且味道有點霉味，建議除濕要加強。
3. 另外，冬天去的時候房間完全沒有冷氣，但日間的時候是十幾二十度，房間很熱很悶，只能問酒店拿電風扇。。這個部分有點不能接受，始終房間價格不低，是四星的價格但連冷氣都沒有。
4.早餐一般，沒有太大驚喜。
個人體驗來說，整體來說真的沒有小紅書說的那麼好，有點失望了。

msg:介紹説這是一家園林酒店，所以嘗試住了一晚。總體來説性價比是可以的。
      1.有評論説酒店比較舊，確實是這樣。可以看出當初的裝修是花了本錢的，但畢竟時間長了:抽屜關不上，洗澡間的玻璃門密封條老化，導致洗澡水流到外面，諸如此類，其實都不是大問題，但積攢起來就讓人覺得掉檔次了，如果能及時維修會好很多。
      2.酒店依山傍水，錯落有致，還是挺有情調的。有評論説這裏晚上黑燈瞎火，確實如此，但卻很有東南亞的風情，這點看自己的接受程度吧。
      3.服務員的態度都挺不錯的，個別員工可能新來的，有點不太熟悉業務，不過態度蠻好，也不影響心情。
      4.温泉池稍有點槽點，一共十來個池吧，反正我入住那天人不多，感覺還可以，衹是沒有熱炕床，沒有乾濕蒸，沒有室內休息區，更不提供休閑小食，衹提供羅漢果茶和姜水（姜水味道很濃，這個要贊）。
       5.酒店綠化很多，估計也沒怎麼噴葯，房間裏蚊子比較多，還好能提供電蚊水，還挺有效，看到幾衹蚊子的屍體。
       6.自助早餐不算太豐富，衹能説過得去吧。
       不過幾百塊錢，這樣的環境和服務，還是值的。

環境：每個房間的味道都很大，很大很大的黴味，重要的是處理結果一般，因為房間味道大，申請換房間，還説要問一下經理，看看要不要加錢，首先我想説的是，我訂的房間，味道大，你們第一時間不是給我看看哪個房間可以換，而是第一反應是看要不要加錢，看看換另一個房型要加多少錢，第二，後來換了房間説不用加錢，因為我一開始訂的是親子房，所以裏面有個小球，想帶去另一個房間玩一下，又要説要請示經理，看看有沒有多出來的才能拿過去，我想説的是，你們要分清楚，我訂這個親子房，是因為裏面的配套我才訂，有味道，才需要換房間，本來就已經很不愉快，小朋友已經很不開心，連一個小球，都要問一下有沒有多餘的才能拿去，整件事聽上去就很離譜。

設施：相對陳舊，房間內很多地方破損了也不更換衹是修補一下很難看，懷舊是一種風格而不是失修的借喻

服務：大致可以，提出部分問題也有相對的補償但擺渡車實在是太慢而且很錯亂

衞生：在這個價位裏做到比快捷酒店還差確實是比較失望了，上一趟住客的毛髮清理不乾淨，蚊蟲沒驅趕好，地板灰塵明顯，玻璃水漬清理不到位，淋雨設施積垢嚴重而且温泉區泡池裡很多飛蟲屍體也沒人清理，差強人意了。

msg:寶們 聽勸 如果你有看評價 麻煩認真看看差評 會驚到你的 為了寶們的金錢和體驗 可以自己衡量一下 很多水軍和營銷號就不説了
劃重點
【温泉衹開下午三點到晚上 意味着你入住當天不泡或者晚到基本可以忽略這個設施了】
【如果夏天去 還有兩個泳池可以玩一下 冬天除了這個迷你“温泉”可以讓你“參與”一下 基本就是來發呆的 等到點退房讓我花的房費沒這麼“**”而已 這個温泉 十個手指可以數完？我粗略看了有五六個？還有兩個是停了説維修的 有一個昏暗迷你的更衣室 還有個燈都不亮的茶水間？温泉旁邊沒有一條備用毛巾 另外户外有個湖邊？和一個好像是新建的小童樂園 還有歎為觀止的“服務”】
【吃飯大事！餐廳的評價你們看其他評論 反正我不敢試 方圓百里衹有一家農莊外賣的 我們是開車去打包的】
【還有温泉非常不人性的設計 不知道是不是後來加建的？在一進大門口的位置 接駁車衹停在樓梯口（説是接駁店點 但是明明有路可以開到温泉門口）然後非要爬幾層樓梯才能上去 大白天就算了 如果是晚上 那長者和小孩也要在這麼昏暗的燈光下爬樓梯麼？大冷天也要自己爬上去？重點是有路呀？！實在不解】
設施：比較舊了 兩個房間 分別有些燈是不亮的 窗簾按鈕壞的 地上很多劃痕 進門的樓道內有一個缺口 少了塊板也沒補上 房間面積夠大 燈光昏暗
衞生：還可以 不失不過吧 被套有破洞
環境：綠植量夠 垃圾桶破舊不堪 各種指示牌掉色模糊
早餐據説種類還可以

早餐環境清幽園景， 食物質數不錯，葡撻，雞肉腸，牛肉腸，好食。 沙律，玉米，蕃茄食材新鮮
炒米粉，湯河粉冇味精。 唯一個人覺得燒賣麻麻地。 晚餐套餐豐富，湯很清甜出味，生菜，菜心超甜超爽！滷水拼盤豆腐好入味，鵝片難咬，甜品好唔會過甜。
温泉區有不同功效的池，並且有按摩池很給力！
游泳池提供了香蕉船和海䐁大水泡打卡休閑
服務台職員海燕好細心幫我叫車🚗

總括這一間酒店很適合一家大細來遊玩，環境很清幽綠化。滿滿綠色的植物包圍着，這感覺很喜歡😌

2.前台服務員睡眼惺忪的過來辦理入住，才告知温泉時間是下午3點-夜晚11點，那我泡個犢子？第二天退房了温泉還沒得泡，和前台交涉這樣屬於打着温泉幌子去欺騙客户，前台給的解決方案是下次入住購買不含早餐的房型，然後這邊贈送兩位早餐，就這服務我下次還訂的話我就是沈騰了，1000多元訂的房間我差你兩份早餐？最後再給出的解決方案就是免費享用房間minibar食品，好！我同意了，後續更精彩……
3.電瓶車師傅把我們拉到房間，還算熱情，細心詢問我們房間需要什麼，給我們添置了小童浴袍和牙具，這裏給個贊，很貼心（僅限電瓶車師傅）
4.進入房間安置行李時順手打開了minibar吧，驚呆了我靠，空的！對，你沒聽錯，空的，然後立馬電話詢問前台，剛才那位服務員告知，空的就沒辦法了，給你送多幾瓶農夫山泉過去吧…
5.繼續詢問肚子餓了，外賣已經沒有了，客房送餐有嗎？下班了…有便利店嗎？下班了…有24小時售賣機嗎？沒有…
請問，沐蓮莊的花都店總經理，您的團隊這樣運作的您知道嗎？我終於知道這個酒店的前身喜來登為何不做了，因為周邊無配套，鳥不拉屎，喜來登這個招牌做不下去，結果給了沐蓮莊，我可以很負責的告訴您，這個品牌我永遠不會考慮

環境：綠化面積大，依山傍水，很舒服的，下雨天濕氣重。
服務：前台服務態度差，甚至懷疑沒有專業培訓過，居然與顧客理論，然後旁邊的高級又突然插嘴，當天問會員入會如何，不搭理。隔天又問我入會沒有，差評。
小童樂園:旁邊是廁所，臭臭，有些臟。
早餐:早餐差，自助晚餐也差。
遊戲區暢玩:還好，人少，雖然設施殘舊，不過盡興。
順便表揚一下，游泳池的工作蠻負責任，有清潔，還有中餐廳，好吃的，建議住客有折扣。忘了，温泉衹有8個，太少了，還有酒店管理很亂。

msg:到達酒店時居然沒有服務員，門僮，找半天才找到前台，而且衹有一個人在，態度也較冷淡。後面多了一些人後才陸續進來，還給我們升級了房型，算是一點挽回吧。不過房間有點老舊，出去陽台的門吱嘎響，訂的是帶晚餐的套餐，餐廳就有點讓人掉眼鏡了，不多説，自己體會。

msg:花都木蓮莊酒店，之前是喜來登酒店，後來被木蓮莊收購了，原本就是衝著喜來登名氣入住的，8年前感覺還可以，所以這次國慶就又去住了一次，總體住下來可圈可點吧，有值得表揚的地方，也有想給差評值得吐槽的點
值得表揚：
1. 自助餐還是不錯的，不管是自助早餐還是自助晚餐，基本達到了普通五星標準
2. 温泉：温泉很舒服，是酒店一個特色亮點，不過池子就比較少，遇到人多的時候感覺像下餃子，不過我們是人少時候去的，感覺還不錯
3. 泳池：室外有兩個泳池，一個小孩子，一個成人的，池子水都比較乾淨，換水也比較勤，遊起來還是比較舒服的。
4. 環境: 綠化面積大，依山傍水，走起路來散步在綠化叢中，不會太曬

需要改進：
1. 整體設施有些陳舊，房間有黴味，衞生間花灑直沖的淋浴開大一點，居然泛水花到淋浴門外，真是驚呆了，使用燒水壺很陳舊，門閥蓋也沒法自動打卡，每次要兩衹手處理
2. 温泉很舒服，但這麼大星級酒店浸温泉時，居然衹有羅漢果提供，沒有餅乾、西瓜一類的小食，而且還看到服務員偷偷在吃西瓜，感覺就很不好。
3. 酒店電視提供節目偏少，沒有網絡電影看，對於偌大一個酒店，周邊叫不到外賣的情況下，酒店本身棋牌娛樂設施又少，以前記得有熒幕電影院的，這次沒怎麼留意到，本身酒店硬件和網絡基礎設施就得加強改造，否則很難吸引回頭客。
4. 酒店最大亮點就是湖景，但是確沒有好好利用，可以開闢一些湖景遊覽娛樂設施，比如划船，雙人水上單車，否則感覺遊園項目很枯燥，也沒啥值得光顧的點

酒店房間 前台 餐廳 停車場 都是分開地點 有距離 需要乘坐電瓶車去每一個地方 如果帶娃的真心不建議 這裏不方便除了空氣好服務好 。

msg:房間：
1、房間是比較大的，但是房間沒有配USB充電口，衹能向酒店借充電器;
2、酒店的所有房間沒有配備電梯，都是獨棟別墅，房間不是在負一，就是在二三層，對於我孩子還沒會走路需要用嬰兒車來説是非常不友好
酒店設施：
1、户外游泳池有2個，不大，但是幾乎都沒有無障礙設施，要走很多樓梯
2、酒店裡有個户外小童樂園，像是廢置很久的，地方也不大，設施也舊，我們去到那邊就是給蚊子來了一頓自助餐
服務：
酒店服務基本打電話就能滿足需求，但是酒店的接送電車衹有2台，酒店裡的路比較窄也就是個單行道，每次叫車都要等很久
餐飲：
1、酒店的下午茶跟早餐是同個地方，空調開了跟沒開一樣，坐的滿身是汗
2、早餐真的款式太少了，大概就是快捷酒店的早餐差不多
3、套餐的晚餐還算可以的，至少中餐廳的空調很足，味道還是比較￼正常
整體評價：
帶不會走路的孩子來真的太折磨了，每次下樓嬰兒車跟孩子提上提下真的很累，整個酒店幾乎沒有無障礙設施，樓梯比較多！酒店設施也太舊，餐飲也沒有讓我驚艷，最主要酒店的主樓空調真的太熱了，裏面開了空調至少也有28-29度…真的是一次很失望的旅行

服務很貼心。
湖邊餐廳雖然價格貴，但是環境也是很舒服，出品也不錯的。
早餐品種豐富。餐廳門口還有一台遊戲機可以免費玩，雖然有點破舊，但小朋友還是玩得高興。
有健身房。
很多綠植，有免費小童遊樂設施，室內室外都有，也有收費的，游泳池比較舒服，水質感覺不錯，夏天親子避暑很適合。
但是温泉就失望，水質很差，水裡還飄着很多垃圾沒被打掃，也沒有提供幹毛巾給客人隨時替換，衹能從頭到底包着一條濕漉漉的毛巾。

退房前 清潔阿姨來敲門二次 服了 服務體驗真的差 完全沒水準 連幾百一晚的商務酒店也不至於這樣的服務

精彩的在後麪，晚上很晚才洗澡，發現淋浴間的花灑非常複雜，居然不會使用，折騰了很久，熱水太熱洗不了澡，後來居然關不了！
這是什麼鬼地方，提醒大家，下次入住一定要多加留意！

1.我定的80方大房，結果裏面的樹砍掉了，留下了如圖的情況，你住在裏面什麼感覺？
2.從停車場走出來，衹有行車的路開了路燈，其他都沒有開，我白天走台階經過宴會廳門口沒有問題，晚上就摔了一跤，和前台説了，晚上出去買東西也沒有看到開燈，摸着黑下去的
3.住酒店停車，就給辦了一次，我出去晚飯沒有問題，晚飯回來買水果，結果出去就要繳費，我和保安説住酒店的有登記，門口保安説：我衹負責收錢，你要不掃碼給錢，要不開回去，無敵吧，我給酒店打了電話，他們説這不是他們物業，也管不了，我説我住一晚的酒店，不至於就登記一次吧，他們説實在不好意思，忘記了，然後明天讓主管給您電話，結果呢，一直沒有
4.餐食太差了，我就吃了一個早餐，啥也沒有，吃了一碗麪
真的不建議去住木蓮莊酒店，管理確實太差勁了，我不知道腦子有啥問題，花了1000多住一晚，應該加1000去從都的！

缺點：首先客房之間隔得有點遠，酒店內往來得坐電瓶車，儘管已經提前電話叮囑分房時儘量在一起，最後仍然分散在3棟不同方向的別墅，朋友多了不方便聚在一起喝茶～；
其次保險櫃莫名其妙地壞了，打了3次電話、次日9點後才提供開櫃服務；
再者温泉區與房間距離較遠，冬天穿着泳衣裹着浴巾寒風中瑟瑟發抖好不容易等來電瓶車，還繞了N棟別墅最後去温泉；
此外洗澡沐浴間積水比較嚴重

請問您來看過這台冰箱了嗎？完全沒有在運作是您説的所謂的保鮮嗎？我全世界住過這麼多酒店還真是第一次遇到您説的酒店冰箱都是不製冷的情況呢。
我再次詢問他們酒店是否所有房間冰箱都是如此，此工作人員回答我是的。（後續我換房試的冰箱都是好的🙃）
再次催促下才有工作人員上門，告知兩個問題都無法解決，讓我們聯繫前台換房，再次想給前台打電話時，用房間電話撥打多次都無人接聽，最後用自己手機微弱的信號打酒店電話才聯繫上。（房間信號很差）
同意換房後又是等了一個小時幾次催促下才有人來帶我們去看房間換房。
總而言之就是服務態度太差了！！體驗感極差！當天是普通工作日，並不是節假日週末，如果是週末來的話等待時間是否還要翻倍？希望貴酒店工作人員好好提升服務態度和質量
服務：100分滿分給20分，這二十分分別給來接我的兩位小哥🙂

防蚊水和電蚊拍是必須的，酒店的電蚊香沒啥用
定期清洗帳篷外觀吧，雖然整體影響不大，但沒有黑點心情更好
娛樂設施和活動不足，就温泉和燒烤，可以考慮增加幕布電影或者音樂駐場
室內小童遊樂區通風不足，很大一股味道
早餐出品可以
帳篷區其實不大，綠化比較重的人工痕跡，很整潔，但是少了點野趣
總結：去一次可。

msg:五一的時候入住2633房，酒店配置其實挺好的，也比較清幽。酒店大堂餐廳都比較有質感，衹可惜入住那兩天花東鎮有疫情防控，早餐不能堂食，比較可惜，衹能自選套餐送上門，品種還行，不過要添加東西就不方便了。此外房間已經是酒店最高的位置，景觀很普通，沒啥看點。反倒是門口的露營地挺不錯，以後可以嘗試露營。
總結了房間存在的幾個問題，希望能改善。
1.貓眼模糊，無法看清外面情況。
2.電動窗簾失靈，中間左側不動，右邊不動。中間合不上。
3.水壓不穩定，時大時小。
4.有明顯的低沉噪音，不知道哪裡傳來的，不是窗外的風聲，晚上稍稍影響睡眠。
5.室內不通風，黴味很重。地毯比較臟，估計是味道來源的一大因素。開了大門空氣也不流通。

不是性價比之選，不過我現在的標準的：市內，可以玩水，價格低於週六
難得出遊，遊客説粵語的佔多數[親親]，估計都是疫情原因
早餐：選擇不多，味道🉑，7-10點供應，即使9:45了仍會上新
下午茶：有驚喜！三杯鮮榨橙汁＋水果甜品三層拼盤＋炸雞薯條，分量足，味道OK，所有都是現做，所以等的時間長
晚餐：附近農家樂
温泉：衹有一大＋八個小池，雖然不是温泉水，但乾淨，看着打掃完放水的
泳池：五月才開放
小童樂園：室內室外均有，室內的就在餐廳旁邊，適合0-4歲，不大但我小女兒卻很喜歡[捂臉]；室外的有沙池＋多種設施，但座椅位沒有樹蔭，我提前做了功課，帶了野餐墊[嘿哈]
房間：園景房，在山上，離大堂遠，電瓶車隨叫隨到。大！有衣帽間、大沙發、浴缸、1.35×2雙床
路程：市區1小時即達，我們12點多退房，趕一點半的興趣班綽綽有餘
酒店：服務態度極好！雖然沒有認真逛，但我們就住在山頂，估計酒店不大。能看到滿天繁星，如果不怕蚊子可以選擇帳篷房

環境:綠化植被看來是花了大手筆的，園區大而分散，提供24小時電瓶車接送服務的，有需要一個電話就到，簡約，雅緻，親近自然，很讓人放鬆。
硬件:看得出有喜來登的影子，高大上。還新開了温泉和帳篷，適合三五成羣BBQ。
服務:前台小哥哥小姐姐都熱情友好，不嫌麻煩我和女朋友解決各種麻煩，女朋友絲襪刮花了，顏值控的她硬是要整上一雙完美的才能入境拍照，前台小姐姐變魔術似的給我們提供了一雙。
温泉:池子少，但是個個都很精緻，牛奶玫瑰池我們很喜歡，服務員非常Nice

入住時，前台的陳先生提供了熱情友好的服務。入住過程中，遇到了一個小插曲，前台的温小姐及時靈活的為客户提供了幫助，然後也有跟進到位，覺得很滿意。

這裏的工作人員服務態度都很好，必須謝謝前台的温小姐和朱女士，原本我們訂的是庭景房，因為我們希望兩間房間可以靠近一起方便照顧小朋友和長輩，前台小姐姐們立馬給我們安排，而且還給我們升級了套房，真的很貼心很温暖，家人都住得很舒服！
然後酒店這邊的温泉池很乾凈，景色也很好。酒店還有室內和室外的小童樂園，對帶小朋友一起出行的我們來説，這次的行程非常滿意！

另外需要投訴今天前台值班的女士服務人員，提前打了電話叫電動車過來接，結果等了10分鐘還不來，第二次打電話催才來，這服務太拉垮。

msg:趁春節前高峯期帶家人小朋友出來花都木蓮莊泡温泉，沒想到節前哪裡都旺，高速堵車開了幾個小時才到，來到前台也是很旺，很多人辦理入住，心情全無，當時房間衞生還沒好，瞬間要炸了，後來通過夏經理的協調迅速入住了房間。房間在3樓，非常高的層高，60多平方住着非常舒服，2大3小夠住了，夏經理還想客人之所急，沒等我開口就主動給我多安排3個人的洗漱用品，非常貼心，雖然有些小插曲，前台夏經理的友好幫助及解決問題的速度和誠意讓我和家人非常滿意，看得出酒店應對高峯期的各方面管理還是不錯的。酒店還有新開的帳篷，去參觀了一下，非常適合家庭聚會燒烤，下次體驗一把。

值得一提的是酒店有充電樁，雖然是慢充但對電池好呀，充電離房間有點遠，牛經理都安排好了電車接送，特別贊👍
酒店附近的港頭村也值得逛一下

🔔服务：酒店辦入住很快，早餐沒有太多選擇，但員工都挺友善，房間的水飲完後打電話去前台，他們很快就叫到人送水過來。

🧹卫生：帳篷內就像一間小型客房，需要的都有，不過只有一盞燈，夜晚房內有點暗。另外因為是布帳篷，所以布都發霉了。

總的來說，住在帳篷內是一個挺特別的經驗，週末過來放鬆一下挺舒服。

msg:簡直垃圾，千萬不要去。昨晚去到七點半入住，我們訂了兩間大床房，進到房間發現是兩間雙床房，打去前台問，前台不理會還掛我們電話，我們就去前台換，前台説沒有房了衹有雙床房，我提前十天就預訂了房間和我説沒有大床房了。最後與前台溝通後決定幫我們升級為豪華大床房，去到房間後發現與原來雙床房是一樣的房型，衹是幫我們把兩件床拼在一起，中間還有條縫在那裡。問前台直接無視處理一副愛住不住的態度，怪不得差評這麼多，差評多是有道理的。真的無語了花了一千七百多這種服務，是我住過最垃圾的酒店。各位友友們千萬要避雷!!!

🧹衞生：當時我住的是帳篷房，我到的時候服務員還做着衞生，看到還是很細緻。入住後沒有發覺異味和垃圾。就是帳篷用久了有黴點。
🍃環境：適合週末放鬆，綠植覆蓋率高，有很多小野貓。空氣也很好。我當時挑選晚飯時間泡温泉，很舒服，人少。
🔔服務：之前看了評論很擔心，到了以後首先是前台，服務還行，還有一個前台負責人在旁邊和客人溝通防疫情況。前台小姐姐小哥哥都不錯，辦手續沒有等很久，而且在客房打電話過去要東西，基本五六分鐘就會到。温泉區的員工一直詢問需要茶水和告訴我毛巾在哪。一直幫我們擺鞋。有一點很重要，我跟朋友在泡温泉他們都會走遠一點站着，給大家一點私密空間。這個服務意識很值得讚揚。總體來説都蠻有禮貌的。

看再多的評論都需要自己去體驗，每個人住的房間不一樣，當時情況不一樣，體驗自然不一樣

2. 房間裏面床頭的控制面板晚上一直在發光，真的很有毒
3. 酒店的備品不全，客房mini bar連礦泉水和紙巾都沒有，打電話給前台讓他們幫忙送也沒有送

msg:特別無語的一次度假體驗 住房環境很一般 我們訂的庭景大床房 進去就像七天酒店一樣十幾平大小 房間在一樓 拉開窗簾就是來來往往的住客 庭景在哪裡是看不到了 還有一根大柱子擋着 蚊蟲也比較多 插了電蚊香也被叮起包了 後來和前台好説歹説才給我們換房 也是庭景大床房 但是這次是二樓的房子 房間大了差不多一半 有個陽台還有浴缸 所以不知道都是庭景大床房有什麼不一樣 是看人下菜碟嗎？因為房型也叫庭景大床房…
第一天下午四點辦理入住 酒店告知温泉設備在維修 大概要兩三個小時後才可以使用 到了晚上八點多我們詢問前台 前台告知設備還在維修 二十分鐘後應該可以使用 過了半小時我們再次諮詢前台 被告知今晚也不能泡温泉了 衹能明天上午才恢復温泉設備…難道客人來入住這裏就是單純睡一覺就回去的嗎？很無語…兩天一夜的度假體驗就是過去睡了一晚上819的房🙃

msg:🍃環境：首先最好的就衹有環境了吧，天氣好的時候真的可以原圖直出，環境好空氣好，帳篷區的綠化是很出片的

🧹衞生：星夜帳篷區的帳篷進去味道還是有一丟丟的，靠擴香壓不住，對居住氣味有要求的慎重考慮

🚗 交通：佛山過去一個小時就到了，還是很方便的，不過周邊都比較山旮旯，找個便利店都要開車出去10分鐘。出入小區大門還要免費停車票才可以免費，記得去拿！如果車子開了無感付款的聯繫您直接取消綁定無感付款！否則直接扣錢保安也不懂怎麼給你退錢！


🔔服務：最tm差的就是服務了吧！看來大家都對服務衹有差評！哦最好就是電瓶車司機了，幫拿行李還會幫你放好慢慢開。
第一，説好的三點入住，提前幾天打電話問我幾點過去，我已經確認是三點，結果準時去到之後得知房間衞生未搞好，咪咪摸摸給我搞了40分鐘的衞生！後來讓我過去帳篷問清潔阿姨拿鑰匙，結果阿姨告訴我也沒鑰匙……後來打了好幾個電話過去問才接通，接通還告訴我等一下還不知道鑰匙在哪裡，問候了幾句是電瓶車司機給送過來的……
第二，泡温泉其實環境可以，雖然比較簡陋，也預料到沒有人給倒水，這些其實都算了，最無語的是温泉開放時間是15點到23點，入温泉區的時候前台會提醒22點50要出來，這也沒什麼，最**的是更衣室阿姨22點30分就開始催催催？一直説“要關門了趕緊的”“再不趕緊的就要把你們鎖在裏面了”這個服務態度估計不止我一個人有意見吧？？？

全程無語子的旅行經歷，除了好天氣能治癒，其他都無語子🌝反正1400一個帳篷房間其實沒什麼的，就是這***服務給錢也不想再去嘻嘻

可能夏天去會比較合適，現在這個時間可以玩的不多。

msg:第三次入住了，環境、衞生、設施沒什麼可説的，一如既往的好。
不過本次有幾點不滿：
1.前台工作人員太少，效率也有待提高。週末本就客人會比較多，check in的時候前台卻衹有一個人處理，同時有好幾波客人在等，對於豪華酒店來説相當不合理。
2.同樣是前台人員配備不足，在客房打電話叫車時，打了好幾通都沒人接，前台失蹤。
3.温泉區關閉時間是23：00，但被告知實際10：40就要散客收水了。本來到店時間就比較晚，掐着時間算還想泡個半小時左右（到達温泉區10：30）實際剛下水五分鐘便衹能被通知走人了。雖然不清楚也不打算幹預酒店的運營管理政策，但是建議可以彈性控制温泉區時間，比如考慮到會有一些客人到店比較晚，可以在週末期間適當放寬温泉時間。（畢竟酒店以温泉為主要吸引點）
其餘方面大致無可挑剔，希望木蓮莊越做越好。
