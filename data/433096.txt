Amazing huge park and amenities around. Definitely worth to visit for 1-2 days. Unfortunately no English, but could use my low level small talk chinese . Would go again. 
Very good breakfast!

msg:I brought my parents to Shaoxing for a trip and booked Dayu Kaiyuan Guantang. First of all, there were not many tourists during the off-peak hours after the holiday, and the whole resort was quiet and comfortable. The room we booked was in the ancient street, with good scenery along the way and convenient eating. There was the Yujia Courtyard where you could order dishes and a small noodle restaurant. The room was on the street, and I was worried whether it would be noisy, but you couldn't drive in. The cars that could be driven were the battery cars that sent guests in the scenic area, which usually ended at 10 pm, so it basically didn't affect sleep. Because it is an old house, the sound insulation is really not very good. The hotel's breakfast is also quite good, especially there is a separate dining table set up for children, which is very heartwarming to look at. I will come again next time I have the chance.

msg:Shaoxing Dayu Kaiyuan Guantang, a scenic hotel in the home of a small bridge and flowing water, you don't need to go to the ancient town. You can stroll here, row, taste rice wine tie-dye and other activities. If the weather is bad, you really don't need to arrange other outdoor attractions. You can stroll in the hotel for a long time. The breakfast is also rich. There are no noisy tour groups and you can enjoy the quiet time quietly! Things that need improvement: 1. The towels in the room should be changed. They are too old. 2. The aromatherapy smell is so strong and a bit pungent.

msg:I booked a sunken room with a small balcony for privacy. It was getting dark when I checked in and I couldn't see the whole view. After resting in the room, I took a walk around the hotel. The air was fresh and comfortable after the rain. The ancient town shops and small villas with independent guest rooms were filled with soft light. There were tourists in groups of three or two, which made people relax and calm down at this moment! I took a look at the whole view before breakfast the next day. It turned out that the wisteria flowers had bloomed, adding color to the greenery. Soon, the roses in the house will be another beautiful sight! The breakfast is rich in variety, a combination of Chinese and Western. Except for the distance from the train station, I really love it!

At the foot of Kuaiji Mountain, next to Dayu Mausoleum, with a long history, quaint villages, and beautiful environment, one step at a time is suitable for travel photography. The hotel package is very cost-effective. The balcony twin room in the second phase is very spacious, with willows and spring scenery. It also gave away Wupeng boat tickets and 50 yuan meal coupons. The price-performance ratio is full, the breakfast variety is good, the dishes in Yujia Courtyard and noodle house are also delicious, and you can enjoy a slow life without going out. The service concept is very strong. Customer Xiao Xie added the butler service in advance, asking about the well-being and providing thoughtful service throughout the whole process. Tingting at the front desk and Yifan, the little beauty, always greeted with a smile, which made people feel very comfortable. I will choose Dayu Guantang again when I come to Shaoxing in the future.

This time, because my companions suddenly felt unwell and wanted to check in early, I contacted the hotel housekeeper Xiao Xie, who arranged the check-in as soon as possible, and the three rooms were connected together, which was very considerate.
There is an air purifier in the room, and the balcony of the room can see the scenery of the courtyard. You can make a pot of tea and take a rest on the balcony. The hotel's indoor swimming pool is very clean and not crowded.
The staff in the lobby are very warm and considerate. I also informed the takeaway I ordered quickly. The breakfast is very rich. It is the first time to eat boiled eggs with longan in the hotel. The roasted sweet potatoes are very sweet and sticky. There are both Chinese and Western breakfasts. The thoughtful hot milk, and also enjoyed dinner in the Yujia Courtyard in the hotel. The dinner is very special, and one of the vinegar fish is very tender.
The scenery in the hotel is quaint. If you don't want to go out, you can go shopping in the hotel, which is another scenery. Next time, I will choose Dayu Kaiyuan Guantang again.

The balcony duplex room in the second phase of the hotel is very suitable for the whole family to stay. I personally prefer the second phase to be relatively new. The hotel service is good, the battery car is available on call, and the waiter is well-trained and very dedicated when dining at Dayu Renjia in the evening. Thanks to Qiuhao and Tingting at the hotel front desk for their enthusiastic service. I will choose to stay next time I come to Shaoxing.

In order to avoid the peak of the May Day holiday, I chose to come to Shaoxing Dayu Kaiyuan Guantang Hotel on the first day after the holiday. As expected, the hotel is located in an ancient village with rich green plants, small bridges and flowing water, and a great ecological environment. Fortunately, I was upgraded by the hotel and was arranged in the quaint Pingcheng Street guest room, with a duplex building and integrated with the surrounding natural scenery. Especially in the early morning, I opened the front and back windows, lay on the bed, listened to the chirping of birds outside the window, bathed in the slow sunlight of the morning, and breathed the fresh air of nature... It was like being in a paradise, it was really comfortable. In addition, the hotel's morning is particularly rich, and there are many special delicacies in Shaoxing, such as Meicai oil gluten, longan Shuipu eggs... This is the best one I have traveled recently.

The first phase of the hotel was transformed from an ancient village. You can stroll around and take pictures. There is a Yujia Courtyard where you can order food. There is also a noodle shop. It was not open when we passed by. Maybe it was not time for dinner.
The second phase of the hotel is an enclosed three-story building (the first floor is a semi-basement, try not to choose a room in the semi-basement), and some villas. We booked the Guantang room and used Ctrip's upgrade rights. We lived in a balcony twin room with a good view, a large room, and a large balcony. However, you should pay attention to mosquito prevention when sitting on the balcony.
The restaurant is not far from our building, and the breakfast is quite rich.
The service of the hotel is also good and clean. Wherever we go, the staff will greet us. Furong and Lidan, who handled the procedures for us at the front desk, spoke softly, sounded comfortable, and were proficient in business.
Figures 1 to 3 are the Guantang balcony room we stayed in. It is recommended. The villas in the second phase are also good, with rooms, halls and small gardens.

The entire ancient village complex is within the hotel, so it is very clean and the vegetation is very lush. The key is quiet, safe and comfortable~ A very in-depth real-life experience of the ancient village~ Although the ancient house is old, you can see that the hotel has been carefully maintained. It is great that the original architecture can be preserved without losing the convenience of modern life. It is very pleasant to take a walk in the hotel every day. The ancient house has eaves. When it rains heavily, you can open the window and watch the rain. Reflecting the tile walls of the ancient road, my mind has already made up for the long and ethereal sound of the guqin. In addition, the hotel service is also in place, and it also has local characteristics. Especially for breakfast and noodle shops, the ingredients are fresh, the cooking is careful, and the shape is beautiful, which is very enjoyable. I will definitely come again if I have a chance~

First, the girl at the front desk patiently explained the location and different functions of the resort when checking in, and also provided a map to mark the points.

I stayed at the Shaoxing Dayu Kaiyuan Guantang Hotel during the May Day holiday. I contacted the hotel in advance on April 28th because I booked three rooms and the elderly at home were not going to go, so I gave the other room to my bestie and asked her to go. As a result, the hotel reservation staff said that the reservation was made under my name and my bestie could not check in. I asked why I filled in my husband's name when placing the order, but he couldn't go on the weekend because of something. I couldn't check in with my child? The answer was yes. I have stayed at Kaiyuan Hotel so many times. This is the first time I heard that I have to check in under my name when making the order. If I don't go, my family can't check in. I said I had to contact Ctrip to modify it. Ctrip customer service said that they didn't have the authority and could only modify it in the reservation depar**ent. As a result, the woman on duty in the reservation depar**ent on the afternoon of April 28th insisted that Ctrip change it to my bestie's name. Of course, I finally learned that Ctrip really didn't have the authority to modify the name of the booker. May I ask the **** of the woman in the reservation depar**ent of your hotel? I made more than 10 calls with my bestie. Of course, in general, except for this incident, the experience after staying here was quite good. The other waiters were also very enthusiastic and the hotel environment was also very good. There is also a Dayu Mausoleum nearby with few people and beautiful environment. So this time, I gave it the lowest score overall. Please don't bother the guests who didn't come to stay. (I have been a member of Kaiyuan for so many years, and I also called the member customer service. They said that it is okay to book anyone in my family. I don't know what this reservation woman is doing). Second, there was a guest of 68 children staying in the children's playground during the May Day holiday, but after entering, I found that there were adults walking in shoes during the period, and the waiter didn't care. I hope the hotel can improve on the above.

Let's talk about the living environment first: low houses with gray tiles and white walls are scattered on both sides of the lake. Red lanterns are hung in front of each building, and beautiful flowers are poking out from the courtyard, which is unique. There are single-family villas, family houses, and the elevator room in the main building with an external balcony where we live. The Japanese style is refreshing. On rainy days, we can enjoy the scenery and chat on the balcony. Let's talk about playing. There is a quaint commercial street in the building complex. The main street is handmade: pottery shops, handmade shops, Yue opera shops, tie-dye shops, as well as yellow wine shops, noodle shops, tea houses, etc. For food, there is a noodle shop and Yujia Courtyard. For breakfast, Yuhuilou has many varieties but the taste is average. Cappuccino is recommended. Oh, you must choose rice noodles between noodles and rice noodles. Because I drove to Lu Xun's former residence and East Lake, there were so many people that I couldn't park my car, so I just soaked in the hotel. I took a black boat at the hotel early in the morning. I didn't have to queue at all, and I enjoyed the surrounding scenery comfortably. Next to the hotel is the Mausoleum of Yu the Great. There are not many tourists. We took the sightseeing car directly to the Bird Center and saw more than a dozen peacocks raised on the slope. Two of them spread their tails together. We were so lucky. If there are many people, this attraction is worth recommending.

The one I like is the best. üëç I drove all the way in and thought it was a scenic spot. I didn't know the way. The brother at the door immediately called a shuttle bus for us to the reception. Since the room was not cleaned, Li Xinshuai, the brother at the front desk, also gave us tickets for the Wupeng boat and added WeChat to remind us to check in later, so that we can play with confidence. After checking in, the fee for the toll bar was waived! I also want to thank an unknown lady at the front desk for patiently introducing the environment of the hotel to us. To be honest, this is not a hotel, it's just an ancient town. It takes an hour to go around. I haven't had enough fun this time. I will choose this hotel next time

Second, there was a guest of 68 children staying in the children's playground during the May Day holiday, but after entering, I found that there were adults walking in shoes during the period, and the waiter didn't care. I hope the hotel can improve on the above.

As for transportation, it is very convenient to take a taxi from Shaoxing North Station, and it is about 65 to the hotel. The next day we also placed an order for a chartered car on Ctrip. The driver was also very enthusiastic, and basically met all kinds of requirements. He would also introduce scenic spots and help us with unsuitable routes; friends who drove to the hotel can also park for free. Shaoxing has newly built many high-speed elevated roads, which are very convenient to go to surrounding scenic spots.
Catering: There is a breakfast buffet restaurant; a Zhejiang cuisine restaurant Yujia Courtyard; a noodle restaurant. The taste is OK.
Service: This is nothing to say, at least the waiters we met were very polite and enthusiastic. Must praise.

On the first day, we chose to stay in Dayu Kaiyuan Guantang in Shaoxing. Now is a good time to enjoy the flowers. Although it rained in the past two days, I experienced the beauty of "the spring road rain adds flowers, and the flowers move the spring scenery of the mountain". The hotel can not only appreciate the beauty of flowers, but also the beauty of people. The waiters here are very enthusiastic. When we were eating special food in the breakfast room, the waiter Liu Tao enthusiastically helped us get paper towels and tableware, which made us feel full of experience. The facilities here are also complete, with a gym, swimming pool, children's playground, camping ground, Huangjiu wine shop, coffee shop, etc. You can play all day without leaving the store. I recommend everyone to go here and enjoy the spring with Shaoxing.

We had dinner at Yujia Courtyard on the day of check-in. It was very Shaoxing cuisine, and the carved wine was also very strong. This time I took my parents out and booked a sunny family duplex room, which was very spacious and comfortable. The hotel gave us breakfast~ Thank you Yifan and Xinshuai, the two front desk staff, for their warm reception and meticulous service. Next time I come to Shaoxing, I will choose to stay here.

So the room types and facilities in the first phase are very old.
But the antique style restores the time of that time
Street view rooms are quite noisy
There is the sound of street shops and passing cars pressing against the stone slabs.
I even felt the house shaking
Street shops sell tie-dye and porcelain, take pictures of Hanfu, and listen to storytelling
Basically meet the needs
You can take a awning boat to the Tomb of Dayu
It‚Äôs quite convenient to go to the ancient city.
It rained heavily on the day we left
It feels like finally arriving in Jiangnan

It's only a ten-minute drive away from urban hotspots such as Lu Xun's former residence. The balcony room is also great! The two-day package purchased was great value for money! At first I thought of going out during the day and just sleeping in the night, as long as I could sleep peacefully. But after I checked in, I found that the balcony room had a reasonable layout and complete facilities. You could also live high up and see far away, with the gurgling river at your feet and the weeping willows. Yiyi, spring is in full bloom, and it‚Äôs particularly pleasant to sit on the balcony and enjoy the scenery! You can eat a lot of local specialties for breakfast, which is delicious! Next to the restaurant is a children's playground, which is not very big, but the children had fun for several hours. The front desk staff, Zhou Fengting, is kind and considerate. The hotel provides free boat tickets for rafting on a awning boat; after breakfast every day, the children especially like to feed the lambs and their mothers by the bridge, which are super cute!

msg:The hotel has the local style of the Jiangnan water town. It is located in a quiet location and the rooms restore the local style of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. They are distributed like residential buildings, with stone roads and brick tiles, all of which are simple. During the day, you can hang out and do tie-dying, bask in the sun, and be relaxed and comfortable. The interior layout of the room is thoughtful, clean and warm. Highly recommended for a weekend break and relaxation. Children play.

msg:I stayed in the first phase seven or eight years ago. This time I bought a two-night package and stayed in the second phase. It was a great experience! There are not many people, and the hotel seems to be a scenic spot, with small bridges and flowing water, pet-friendly, and there are little ducks and little goats in the hotel. The staff are really great, they will greet you proactively and care about your needs. The meals in the set menu are all from Yu Family Courtyard, authentic Shaoxing cuisine. We had to leave early because of a temporary need, and the restaurant also helped us pack up one of the set meals that we had no time to redeem, which was very considerate.

It is very suitable for leisure and vacation to calm down and experience this rare peaceful time. This time, I originally booked a garden view villa. The handsome guy Xie at the front desk upgraded it to a river view villa with meticulous service. Thank you very much for being thoughtful and patient. The food in Yujia Courtyard of the hotel is also very tasty and affordable. The overall service of the hotel is very good. I even gave you a souvenir when I left the store. I am so considerate.

msg:I came to Shaoxing for a few days and read a lot online, so I specially booked the Dayu Kaiyuan Guantang Resort, which was built in the original ancient town. It was a very surprising trip~ We rented a car and the place was easy to find. When we arrived at the front desk, Butler Yangyang kept helping us, carefully explaining the various locations of the resort and introducing various facilities to us! Later, when we had various small requests, we contacted Yangyang directly, and she always responded to me quickly! Big thanks to her! Let us see the professionalism of a team.
Facilities: This resort is divided into phases one and two. The first phase is mostly converted from old houses, while the second phase is relatively new. My best friend and I lived with our two children in one of the best villas in the first phase. The shuttle bus couldn't get in, so the driver helped us carry our luggage to the door of the room. It's close to the river and very quiet. If the house faces the street, the shuttle bus may be a little noisy. Recreational facilities such as gyms, swimming pools and children's playgrounds are all concentrated in the second phase. Even if you don't visit other attractions, you will not be bored if you come here to rest for a few days. The breakfast variety is quite rich. We ate at Yujia Courtyard in the hotel many times for dinner. The dishes were exquisite and delicious! Although it is more expensive than outside, it is well made! tasty!
Cleanliness: Although the house we live in is large, it is always kept spotless. This is quite satisfying!
Environment: The entire resort is worth browsing and savoring. There are tie-dying experiences that children can experience, tea making by the fire, etc. that adults like. Various activities.
Service: Once again, I would like to praise the housekeeper Yangyang! We are very satisfied with our excellent service!

msg:I brought my family to Shaoxing during the Spring Festival holiday and booked a courtyard villa in Dayu Kaiyuan Temple. During the Spring Festival, the urban area of ‚Äã‚ÄãShaoxing is full of people, and the experience is average. It is impossible to appreciate the characteristics of life in Shaoxing. On the contrary, Dayu Kaiyuan Temple gave me a great experience. For the first time, the hotel environment is very good. The entire ancient village is the hotel, and the guest rooms are the original ancient village villas. The hotel occupies a large area, with small bridges and flowing water. It has all the elements that a hotel should have in a Jiangnan water town. The most important thing is that even though the housing is full during the Spring Festival, the entire hotel is also very quiet and comfortable, allowing you to experience the real taste of the Jiangnan water town. Compared to people in urban areas who follow the herd, it's a world of difference. There are also many entertainment projects, including ancient stages, awning boats, and pottery. Secondly, the service of the hotel staff is also very good. I would like to express my special thanks to the housekeeper Mr. Zhang Yunlong. I have troubled Mr. Zhang many times and took the trouble to meet our various requests every time. During the Spring Festival peak season, he even took the initiative to extend our stay for us. Check out; and the beautiful woman at the front desk who checked in saw that our package did not include breakfast, and took the initiative to give us breakfast; the beautiful woman at the front desk of Yuhui Building saw that her daughter liked to feed fish, so she gave her fish food twice. All the service staff are very nice. If you want to experience the beauty of Shaoxing during vacation, Dayu Kaiyuan Temple is a good choice.

Environment: The overall environment is quiet and small details are clean. As long as my baby, who is allergic to dust and mites, doesn't cough or react when staying in a hotel, then the hotel's hygiene will definitely pass!
Service: You can feel that all the employees have received professional training. No matter where you go in the hotel, as long as you meet the employees, they will greet you cordially and enthusiastically.
It is particularly worth mentioning that our butler Zhang Yunlong is very thoughtful and customer-centered. He actively responds to customer needs in terms of room type, breakfast, and everything he can help. It makes us feel better when traveling. I think this is very important for travel choices. After all, it‚Äôs all about having fun.
Catering: After the buffet breakfast, the butler also reminded us to go early. There will indeed be more people in the back. We went to the early seats and chose any of them, and we were very satisfied with the meal~
Therefore, if any friends come to Shaoxing, I recommend this hotel!

msg:This time I took my parents on a self-driving trip and accidentally discovered Kaiyuan Temple. I took a fancy to it and booked two nights there. We originally booked a room in the first phase, because it was the off-season and not many people came to play in the bar. The lady at the front desk was very polite and upgraded our room to us, and also introduced the room and hotel environment to us enthusiastically. I booked a duplex family room. The facilities in the room are well-equipped, the lighting is very good, I like it, and it is very clean. The only drawback is that the second floor is a bit stuffy and not breathable. Although there is a skylight, I didn't open it on rainy days.
Every day when you go in and out of the hotel and pass by the corridor, the cleaning aunts and the staff inside will take the initiative to say hello to you and say hello to you. They are very enthusiastic and really make you feel at home.
When I left the hotel, I gave a small gift and chatted for a while. I am very grateful to Ms. Zhao Tingting, and also very grateful to the young lady who received us on the day of check-in. Oh, yes, I have to mention that I really like the fragrance in the lobby and corridors of your hotel. It was a very good experience and feeling.

Every staff member is very enthusiastic and provides attentive service, and there is also a scooter pick-up and drop-off. To my pleasant surprise, the young man who checked in upgraded my room type. Thank you very much! The hotel has a beautiful environment, just like being in an ancient town, quiet and comfortable. A large bag of fruit was also given as a gift, which was fresh and delicious. A bottle of red wine was given as a gift when checking out.
My daughter strongly requested to stay one more day, but due to time constraints, I can only come back next time. Next time I come to Shaoxing, I will definitely choose Dayu Kaiyuan!

The first and second phases are connected and located on both sides of a river. We lived in the first phase, especially It feels like an ancient town at night. Except for the place in the second picture, the hotel‚Äôs dining place is the noodle shop opposite the lobby of the first phase. A bowl of noodles costs more than 80 meters, and the taste is average. We went to the second place to wait for a table the next night, and five people ordered. , the taste is really good, my family all praise it, the only thing is that it is expensive. The room we booked was a suite for four people, upstairs and downstairs. Both rooms had large-screen TVs. The hotel also provided fruit and red wine when we checked in. However, the suite only had one bathroom on the first floor, which was very inconvenient. The room on the first floor was a bit small and the mattress was too soft. The breakfast is still very rich, very good! The hotel also arranged many programs and projects during the Spring Festival.

msg:The natural environment of the hotel is very good. It looks like an ink painting when you take a photo. The rooms are also very unique. We stayed in a river view villa with a patio and a living room. The decoration was relatively early, and some facilities were a bit old. For example, the shower outlet holes in the shower room were blocked. They could obviously be replaced. I didn't report back until I found out. However, the customer service staff responded to our requests and replaced them with new ones the next day. . The hotel's breakfast is very rich and has many varieties. There are 11 types of coffee to choose from in the coffee machine, which is much better than the only 3 choices in most hotels. The guy who picked up the battery car at the door, Wang Yang, was also very polite. He helped carry the suitcases and even gave him a bottle of red wine before leaving. In short, the staff inside are all very service-oriented, which is worthy of praiseüëçüèª
There are a few more suggestions. 1. The marble surface of the shower room is very cold in winter when you go barefoot. I hope to equip it with a non-slip mat or prepare plastic slippers. I asked the staff to find me a non-slip matüëçüèª
2. I hope the hotel will change the toilet paper to a thicker one. It is too thin and makes me tired every time I use it. I have to pull it out several times.
3. The lighting in the room is dim, the bulbs and light *****s all have yellow light, and the facilities are too old. The children want to do some homework during the day, but the lighting is too dim.
I hope the hotel can do better by paying attention to certain details.

Service: In the taxi üöï, the hotel called to confirm the room and added the butler WeChat. From this point of view, the service has exceeded half of the hotel's management.
We checked in very quickly. The butler, Mr. Zhang Yunlong, provided excellent service and a good attitude. He escorted us to the room and told us that we could contact him at any time if we needed anything else.
Environment: We stayed in the Phase II Balcony Twin Room. I was very satisfied with the room location given by the hotel. Standing on the balcony and looking at the dense jungle as the sun rises, a ray of sunlight shines through the window screen and listens to the chirping of birds on the sofa. It's comfortable
The antique charm of the hotel and the style of the Jiangnan water town are all reflected in the small bridges and red lanterns. When traveling in the off-season, the whole village looks very quiet and tidy.
The buffet breakfast in the hotel also has a lot of varieties. Special praise for the swallow skin wontons and beef balls, which are delicious.
The mobile phone keeps taking pictures, and every photo does not require too much color adjus**ent. Dayu Guantang perfectly interprets the Jiangnan water town. I hope to have the opportunity to come back as a family in the future.

If you like ancient Chinese villages in the south of the Yangtze River, this is your first choice. And within the hotel environment, you can experience the pedal-powered awning boat, which feels like a private dock.
The Chinese restaurant is located in an ancient house named Yu Family Courtyard. Sitting in the hall of an ancient house to eat is very atmospheric! On the night of the fourth day of the ***** New Year at "Yu's Noodle House", I met the God of Wealth descending to earth and made a fortune in the Year of the Dragon! The breakfast variety is more Chinese-style and the quantity is quite large, but friends who like Western pastry will be a little disappointed. During the Spring Festival, there are markets and performances on Pingcheng Street, which is like entering an ancient town.
The hotel staff are very enthusiastic, including the front desk, concierge, and battery car driver. Due to the large floor area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel and the wide distribution of guest rooms, it is necessary to frequently call for a battery car, which usually arrives in 3-5 minutes. Moreover, the driver will give kind reminders when getting on and off the bridge.
What an unexpected surprise, after staying in a hotel for more than 20 or 30 years, I received 2 bottles of red wine as a gift for the first time! There are also fruit and dragon treasure pendants, happy! In addition, the residential buildings are relatively simple and the sound insulation is not very good. Talking next door and jumping upstairs will have an impact. If you are sensitive to this, it is recommended to choose a courtyard-style house with water pillows or a house facing the water.

msg:The service of Shaoxing Kaiyuan Guantang is first-class, the security, doormen, car boys, and hotel waiters are all of very high quality. It can be seen that service training is better.
Hotel customer service Xiao Xie also made adjus**ents according to my preferences before we checked in. I had a waist surgery and was very afraid of the cold, so Xiao Xie arranged to turn on the air conditioner in the bathroom in advance. Very heartwarming.
The breakfast at the hotel is very rich. Every dish is very exquisite and made with great care. The waiter works meticulously. The girl at the door answered my four questions patiently. Unfortunately, I forgot to ask her name. A beautiful girl with an oval face.

The hotel environment is very good. Before the epidemic, I stayed at the Kaiyuan Temple in Dazu Rock Carvings in Chongqing and was extremely impressed. I was even more surprised to choose Kaiyuan this time. The hotel is built next to the water, and next door is the Dayu Scenic Area. It is very convenient to enter the scenic area from the hotel's awning boat. The hotel is integrated with the stone steps of the water town's arch bridge, well-proportioned, and the rooms are spacious.

msg:This is my second time staying at Dayu Kaiyuan. Everything is very familiar and friendly. The quiet waterside style makes you feel like living in an ancient town. The duplex room I booked has a lot of space for activities, and it is very convenient to have a bathroom on the upper and lower floors. It was the Spring Festival, but there were many waiters and the service attitude was comfortable. They gave me a small gift of red wine and fruit plate. The children's playground downstairs can liberate adults, and Miss Xu Li is very responsible.
I got together with friends for three days and two nights, went to Lanting Scenic Area, Yuewang Terrace, and had Lantingji. On the morning before I left, I took a taxi to Shaoxing Children's Park. It was like a treasure park. It had a lot of items and was cheap. It was more suitable for children in kindergarten and primary school than Happy Valley.
By the way, during the Spring Festival in Shaoxing, public transportation and tickets to scenic spots are free of charge (reservation required), which is greatüëèüëèüëèA pleasant trip!

Because we brought two elderly people in their 80s to stay, the front desk specially arranged the room on the second floor of Kuaiji Building. The balcony of the room is full of sunshine and faces the second-phase single-family villa and garden (equal to the first floor, and the lower floor is the underground garage). Kaiyuan Guantang has renovated and incorporated the ancient town where the original descendants of Dayu lived. On the old street, you can taste wine and tea, ride a awning boat, watch Yue opera, taste traditional Shaoxing dishes, and experience local folk culture. It is very suitable for family members to travel together. . Our group purchase includes a meal, divided into two types: A and B. We tried the A and B set meals on the first night. We felt that the dishes were average, the portions were too large, and they were too oily and salty. After discussing with the housekeeper Xiao Zhang, we canceled the set meal for the next day, subsidized 200 deductible coupons, and ordered meals by ourselves at the hotel. This time in Dayu Kaiyuan, we tried Yujia Noodle House. The waiter guided us to use Dianping.com group buying coupons to buy the signature noodles. The price is much better and the taste is good. During the set meal at Yujia Courtyard and the self-ordered meals the next day, I felt that the dishes were rough and not refined enough. Compared with the time-honored restaurants, the price was obviously higher. I sincerely hope that the hotel can improve its catering standards and retain the appetite of hotel guests. When we travel around Jiangsu and Zhejiang, we usually choose Kaiyuan. We like its garden-style architecture and comprehensive butler service. This time we stayed at Dayu Kaiyuan. The butler Xiao Zhang greeted us every day and gave us travel suggestions. We felt at home. We will still choose Kaiyuan when traveling in the future. of.

msg:It was a very good experience. After adding the butler Yangyang, I was well taken care of for three days. The children were very happy. The room was also very comfortable and had a yard. The room type of the River View Courtyard Villa is very suitable for parent-child travel.
The hotel's entertainment facilities are quite rich. The staff at the children's playground are very kind, but I forgot to ask their name. The children like the young lady very much.
The enthusiastic service of the Western restaurant waiter Zhu Chenying made me feel warm. There are many kinds of breakfast, the restaurant environment is very warm, and the dishes are rich and delicious.
You can do pottery and tie-dying in the town, as well as coffee shops and teahouses. Tao's restaurant is also delicious.
Great place for a family holiday

msg:Because I saw some bad reviews online, I was a little worried at first, but in the end I really like this place. First of all, this hotel has two phases. The first phase is completely renovated from an ancient village (so awesome! It is said that it was a village slowly formed by his descendants who guarded the tomb of Dayu). It is very antique, but the rooms, especially the bathrooms The facilities are indeed a bit old. But I personally don't feel it has any impact. It's pretty clean and can be used normally. The hot water will take a while, but it will be hot enough. The rooms in the second phase are all newly built in antique style. They are not far from the first phase and can be reached by bridges. The deluxe king bed room we booked is in Phase 1, on the main street. The main street is very close to breakfast restaurants, dinner restaurants, cafes, and various activities.
Secondly, there are a lot of activities on the ancient street in Phase 1! Taking my child out, my biggest headache is that after going out to play and returning to the hotel, he starts playing with his pad when there is nothing to doüòÖ The activities here include 1. Taking a awning boat (you can go to the Tomb of Dayu) 2. Drawing (the child drew a fan) 3. Make pottery (completely free to play, the children have a lot of fun) 4. Make batik (make a bag, and sell rice wine popsicles in the store) 5. There is also a small exhibition hall introducing the Yu family, taking photos of ancient costumes, and tasting Rice wine, listening and speaking books, hanging prayer plaques, feeding koi carps, outdoor movies on weekends, balloons playing in exchange for gifts, and sweet potatoes roasted in the morning. Most activities require an additional fee.
Then, for dining and breakfast, it was quite satisfactory. For dinner, we had three meals at the hotel's Chinese restaurant Yujia Courtyard. Each meal was different and there were many varieties. Except for the drunken chicken which was too salty, there was no fault. They were all quite delicious.
Finally, as for the service, we basically didn‚Äôt use the butler service. We just ordered the shuttle bus a lot. The service of the guys was very good. They were polite and thoughtful and never impatient (this is much better than Lanting Anlu).
We came in winter and felt that there might be more mosquitoes in summer.

I recommend taking a taxi to go to the hometown of Lu Xun, the hometown of Shusheng, and Cangqiao Straight Street. It is very close and costs 20 yuan! Because we are bringing a dog with us, we can only live in the first phase. It has a strong ancient flavor, and bringing the dog with us is like going back to our hometown to visit grandma‚Äôs house! I heard that the second phase is relatively new, and I look forward to bringing my parents to play next time! The hotel restaurant is not highly recommended, but the hotel has butler service. Our butler Yangyang was very attentive. When we checked in, he carefully explained the park map to us. He would also say hello to us every day when we go to and from get off work.

One shortcoming is that there are too many people on Sunday morning, and the replenishment speed obviously cannot keep up. Some customers come at 9:30, and the noodle stall below has no side dishes.

Walking on the gravel alley in the winter afternoon, it is quiet and comfortable without the hustle and bustle of the ancient tourist towns in the past. Thanks to the housekeeper "Yangyang", he provided considerate service from check-in to check-out and upgraded to a river view room. We have arranged welcome fruits, good night milk and souvenirs, and we will respond to requests via WeChat. All hotel service staff encountered at the same time will greet you warmly. Dinner was served in the Yu Family Courtyard. It was large and delicious. The breakfast variety is also very rich and has local Shaoxing characteristics. We have already arranged to stay a few days longer next time we come to Dayu.

In particular, I want to talk about the hotel's service. The butler Chen Lidan's service is very good, responsive to all my requests, and helped me solve a lot of problems! Since it was a birthday and it was the weekend, it was difficult to reserve a seat in the Yu Family Courtyard. I told the housekeeper about this and they quickly helped coordinate it! The stay experience this time was great! Mom and Dad are also very happy!

The hotel is quiet and the birds are singing and the flowers are fragrant. Before leaving, the housekeeper also gave me plum wine as a souvenir. Unforgettable travel.
The only shortcoming of the first phase is that the hot water is relatively slow. After all, it was renovated in 13 years. Although it is well maintained, it is not convenient to adjust the water temperature.

If you like the quaint Chinese style, choose the first phase, which has the characteristics of a water town. For dining, you can choose Dayu Restaurant, which has good taste and reasonable prices. There are 7 charging piles in the hotel parking lot, but most of them are occupied by gas trucks. It is recommended that the hotel has a management plan to ensure the convenience of charging the trams.

The hotel is divided into Phase I (nostalgic style) and Phase II (modern style). This time I booked the first phase and wanted to experience the old style. There was a small car to pick up and drop off from the guest room, and every waiter had a very good attitude.
The nostalgic style of the first issue is really beautiful, and the antique style is in line with the taste of Shaoxing. Manager Chen Lidan, the housekeeper, has been caring since the beginning of our stay. When we learned that it was inconvenient to bring my parents to the room because of the stairs, I offered to upgrade it to a suite with a view for free! thank you very much!
During this trip to Shaoxing, we experienced both the first and second phase rooms. The whole family was very happyü•≥ Thank you to every waiter in the hotel!

We are a young and old family staying together. It is our first time to stay in this type of hotel. It feels very good.

We had lunch and dinner at Yujia Courtyard and Yujia Noodle House respectively. They both tasted good.

msg:The hotel itself is an attraction. You don't need to go to various ancient towns to experience the ancient courtyards with small bridges and flowing water. The house is also very charming, with old-fashioned padlocksüîí and wooden window lattice. When you open the window, you can see awning boats passing by and an ancient stage. Storytelling, it‚Äôs worth staying. I‚Äôll stay here again next time. Special thanks to Wang Shilong, the guy at the front desk, for being patient and taking care of us with the elderly and dogs! It is very close to various cultural attractions and is very convenient.

msg:Dayu Guantang itself is like an independent ancient town. There are rice wine restaurants, tie-dying and other handicraft experience workshops. There are also movies on the stage in the evening~
The rooms in the first phase are more quaint. Before this holiday, I stayed with my parents in a deluxe double room. There is one duplex and one flat floor. For middle-aged and elderly people, it is recommended that flat floors are safer. The old rooms are not trendy, but it is recommended to stay regularly. Check the hardware! Next time you can experience the second phase of the courtyard room.
p.s: WeChat steward Li Xinshuai is very responsible~

I fell in love with this outdoor peach garden.
Booked a hotel immediately.
There are lambs guarding the hotel entrance.
Shaoxing ancient town with gentle rain,
Drink the rice wine and breathe in the faint fragrance.
Guantang Kaiyuan is so comfortable.
The only drawback is that the air conditioning fresh air system in the room is a bit loud.
But every staff member is very kind.
It can be seen that the service management system is very complete.

There is a Wu Peng Boat Pier in the resort where you can directly take a boat to the Dayu Scenic Area.

msg:The sister who checked in carefully introduced the general situation of the hotel. The sister who checked out was very gentle and gave me a souvenir. After taking the shuttle bus twice, she came quickly without waiting and even helped with luggage. During my stay, I was treated gently and courteously by the staff when I asked for directions or things. There were also staff members who took the initiative to say hello on the way. I added the butler Zhang Yunlong on WeChat and asked him if I needed help every day. He also offered to help us delay check-out on the last day, which allowed us to have lunch calmly before leaving, and the schedule was not so rushed.

The room is very big, and the big dog kennel can be placed freely without affecting walking. The dog is very happy running around in it. With floor tiles throughout the house, there is no guilt about dog hair getting on the carpet and making it difficult to clean.
There are two small courtyards in the suite we live in, and there is a third small courtyard outside the bedroom window that can be shared with the next room (in consideration of privacy and security, the curtains are lowered throughout the entire stay so as not to affect the stay experience). There is an independent reading table next to the small courtyard, which is very convenient for working. When you are tired, you can take a look at the small trees in the courtyard, which is very relaxing. There are two toilets, so you don't have to worry about fighting for the toilet.

There is a commercial street in the hotel where you can eat, drink, play and see. You can spend the weekend happily without leaving the hotel.

Hygiene: Although the first phase is an old house renovation, the living conditions are still very good and very clean ~

If you are bringing children, there are special tableware and food windmills for children. If you don‚Äôt want to travel by yourself in the hotel, you can also ask the hotel to take you there with a battery car. A souvenir was given when checking out. If you bring your dog, you can keep it in the house during breakfast, or if you bring it, you can put it in the pet cage at the entrance of the breakfast room, and do not bring it into the dining hall.

I really like the accommodation environment in an ancient village that returns to nature, so this time I went to Shaoxing and specifically chose the guest room in the first phase of Dayu Kaiyuan Temple at the foot of Kuaiji Mountain. Compared with the second phase, the guest rooms in the first phase are all renovated and rebuilt on the basis of the original ancient house, and have more charm. No wonder some people say that this is the replacement of Aman Fayun in Hangzhou. The disadvantage is that the lighting is not very good. This time I stayed in a river view villa. The door opens to a small river. The layout of the living room reminds me of the old couches I lived in when I was a child. The bedroom is also very spacious, the bed is a little softer, the linen is good, and the surprise is the bedside There is a fast charging port, and the guest bathroom is a bit too spacious, haha. There are two patios in the entire villa, both with large floor-to-ceiling windows, which can be regarded as a way to increase lighting. However, it feels a bit weird that the window on one side upstairs is the window of the guest room next door. The room is shaded by bamboo curtains. This old thing has not been seen for a long time. The entire hotel is neither big nor small, and the environment is really good, with small bridges, flowing water, and lotus shadows. In addition, the housekeeper Taotao is very nice and responsive to all requests. Running around in such hot weather is also very hard. Yujia Courtyard and Yujia Noodle House in the hotel can solve the problem of eating. Miraculously, there is also a Costa in the hotel, which saves people like me who rely on coffee to survive.

A family of five booked two garden-view villas. The rooms have two small courtyards and are antique.
The breakfast is very rich, and the swallow skin wontons are a specialty. Before leaving, the children were given fish food.
The awning boat that comes with the package goes around the village and you can see the scenery every step of the way.
I also tried the swimming pool. In the second phase, even though it was a Saturday, there were still few people and I had a lot of fun swimming.
Come back during the Chinese New Year to see the Dayu Temple in winter!

The children's paradise is also very large, with 250 square meters, three or four-story castles for children to discharge happily, and there are also handicraft classes.

The whole hotel feels like an ancient city, and it takes a day to stroll around in it. There are a lot of shuttle buses, and they stop with a wave of your hand. If you are not on the way, you can contact the housekeeper or the nearest staff to help you call a car.

It rained during breakfast, but the housekeeper Yangyang will remind you to be careful of the slippery road, and all kinds of things are connected smoothly and conveniently. The child needs a bed liner and it is delivered immediately. It is a great travel experience!

msg:I have planted grass in this hotel for a long time, and I finally came to experience it. The two-day and one-night trip was very pleasantly surprised and very satisfying. Before I left, I was already looking forward to coming here again next time!
The whole hotel feels like a small resort, and the scenery is really beautiful, which fully satisfies my fantasy of people with small bridges and flowing water. Whether in the morning or at night, strolling on the Qingshiban Road, there are small houses scattered along the roadside, including newly built antique buildings and original old scattered ones. Living by the water, you can enjoy the beauty and tranquility.
This trip was also very lucky. I originally booked an ordinary big bed room, but it was upgraded to a detached villa, with one bedroom and one living room, and a small terrace. It is right by a small river. I like to sit outside on the rattan chair in the morning. , Look at the green trees and flowing water, and listen to the birds and cicadas. Although the room is near the water, there is no humidity in the room, and there are no small bugs, so don't worry at all (I live in the second phase).
The service of the hotel is also very considerate, both the concierge and the front desk are very enthusiastic. The hotel is very big. If you want to go shopping in the first phase or go to Yu's compound for dinner or check out and go to the parking lot, you can call the electric car to pick you up, which is very convenient. The service attitude of Jiao Furong, the little girl at the front desk, is very good. She specially added WeChat to tell me where I can get a taxi or order a takeaway. She also asked if there is a need for a late check-out. She also introduced us to the hotel's breakfast and entertainment programs. There are many types in the restaurant, the taste is good, and the experience is very good.
There are also a lot of fun in the hotel (of course, there is an additional fee), awning boats, pottery, Hanfu rental and photography, children's playgrounds, coffee shops, and rice taverns. You can spend a day at the hotel without being bored.
It is rare to like a hotel so much. After the immersive experience here, there is no need to go to other ancient towns to see the scenery.

It is said that it is the second floor, and the balcony is the first floor, but there is a sunken shared space from the corridor. Unique shape.
The next morning, I took my two children to dinner and felt the unique scenery of the hotel. This is a step-by-step scene, and there are awning boats that can take a price ranging from 75-150-200. There is a children's amu*****t park, which costs 68 for hotel guests and 98 for non-residents.

At first glance, most of them look like young people who have just stepped into society. Of course, their service awareness is weak. , I promised my guests some things and then forgot them... The so-called garden view villa is actually a two-story house. The two rooms are separated, just one above and one below. Those who live in the upper part will understand clearly. I got to know what was going on and chatting with the house downstairs... After giving my opinion, I changed rooms. What was even more outrageous this time was that the two floor-to-ceiling windows in the bedroom faced the living room and yard next door, and the door to the yard next door could be opened. Lying on the two large floor-to-ceiling windows in your bedroom, sitting on the sofa next door, you can enjoy your bedroom. If you forget to draw the curtain, you can clearly see inside. It is very embarrassing, because the child will be tired with you. , I was thinking about staying in a special room in the scenic spot, but it didn't work out, so I didn't want to bother. I might as well live in an ordinary room. The water in the room I was in was not good. If you wash slowly when taking a shower, the water would flood the gold mountain. The environment Yes, the scenery is good and antique. I thought that the pottery package included in the package is different from the children's paradise on the street. It is not clear. There is a fee on the street. The pottery on the street is good and the boss is very enthusiastic and can do it. They took the initiative to let us buy in a group, which was cheaper. I didn‚Äôt participate in any of the items in the package, and no one informed me. They just gave me a coupon or sent a verification text message. Anyway, you asked and told you, but you didn‚Äôt ask. Just act like nothing happened. I think the variety of breakfast is okay. The built-in restaurant in the scenic spot was crowded with people for group building on the first day, and the cooking was a mess. The drunken crabs were all smoothies and had a strong fishy smell. There were fewer people on the second night, and the food was pretty good. The service in the restaurant was good. The cashier is not enthusiastic. In short, the service is sloppy, the attitude is acceptable, but it is ineffective. Overall feeling unhappy!

The price of the group purchase is very favorable, including breakfast and a set of Chinese meal for two. The breakfast is very rich and tastes good. The Chinese meal and the noodles taste very good. Although the price is a bit high at your own expense, a bowl of noodles basically costs more than 60.
The swimming pool is open, and the water temperature is around 26 degrees. If you go in winter, it still feels a bit cold. If you bring children, you may not be able to enter the water.

The whole hotel is a Shaoxing water town style, which can be viewed and checked in. Tourists are all guests, so there are not many people.

OK: The hotel is not very big. It takes half an hour to go around in a circle. If you don't want to walk, you can reserve a battery car for pick-up. The hotel is a fifteen-minute drive from the core scenic spot of Shaoxing, but due to the surrounding subway construction, the road signs are not obvious, and it is not convenient to drive.
Food: The presented afternoon tea tastes good, and Wang Rui's service is also very considerate. For dinner, you can choose Yu Family Courtyard (reservation required) and Yu Family Noodle House, as well as coffee shop, rice wine experience hall, etc.
Tour: The hotel itself is a scenic spot, and you can experience the Shaoxing style without leaving the hotel. Go on a awning boat, experience pottery, tie-dye, etc. Hanfu and cheongsam are also available for rent. Compared with popular scenic spots, there are fewer people and no queues, but the charges are high.

msg:This review is a bit difficult to write, there are places that I like and places that I don't like very much

First of all, what I like very much is the concept and planning of the entire resort.
1. There is a shuttle bus in the hotel, which is very convenient
2. The pool is surprisingly clean
3. The whole is a small ancient town with all kinds of quaint houses, exquisite and simple bridges and flowing water, awning boats, colorful plants, handicraft workshops and noodle restaurants.
4. Wide variety of noodle restaurants at affordable prices
5. The price of the handicraft workshop is reasonable. No reservation is required.
6. The children's playground is also clean and standardized. The three-year-old children had a great time. A staff member Xu Jiaqing took the initiative to inform that they can use the children's playground for free when booking through Ctrip. We would like to express our thanks
7. The service of the front desk staff is still great. There are some small episodes, but I can feel that they tried their best.
8. The little buddies of the shuttle bus also try their best to help the guests
9. It's quite close to Lanting Anlu, and it's good to have lunch in the past

Bad place Hope it can be improved in the future
1. The hygiene is very bad. It seems that the cleaning team is generally lazy and so-so. For example, we witnessed the front desk staff of the hotel asking the cleaning staff to change the water in the small fountain in the hotel lobby, saying that there are bubbles, indicating that there are bacteria and it is not clean. The cleaning staff said that they didn't care. It's going to be replaced here.
2. We stayed for two nights and changed to three rooms. It was very frustrating... The reason is that the second-phase duplex room we entered for the first time had pants left by previous guests, and the air conditioner on the second floor was covered with black molds - as shown in the picture. it's hard to accept
3. That night, the front desk staff helped arrange room inspections and change rooms. The newly changed room was bigger and cleaner, but it was really gray. The children's toys fell under the bed, and when they went down to pick them up, they were all gray and cobwebs.
4. From other comments, I have seen that hygiene has always been a top priority. I don't understand why the hotel does not pay attention to it?

The last villa was the cleanest. It is said to have been renovated. We are grateful for finally having a spacious and clean room with beautiful scenery.

msg:Antique hotel beyond expectations. First of all, the environment of the hotel is very elegant. The street town retains the antique style, with white walls and gray tiles, green willows hanging over the shade, and the spliced stone road makes people unconsciously slow down. The single-family house is full of lush vegetation, and the green plants cover the courtyard, and the overall coverage reaches the best time period. There is a red lantern in front of each house, lit in the night, and there is a feeling of time and space when walking through the street. The river flows through the ancient town, strung together with small bridges and awning boats moored on the shore.
The rooms in the second phase are simple, bright and well-equipped. The hotel has a 24-hour gym and swimming pool. It may be the reason for off-peak travel, and there are not many people using fitness equipment at night. The hotel is particularly commendable that the service attitude of the staff is very warm, and the staff who see it in the hotel will take the initiative to say hello. Special thanks to the hotel's manager Zhang Yunlong for his meticulous service, he gave a lot of help, and his awareness and ability are very commendable.
The hotel also has a restaurant that night, and you can eat directly in the hotel. They are all characteristic local dishes, especially the pork with dried plums and vegetables, which is very delicious and worth recommending. The breakfast is rich in variety, and there are many varieties that children like.
The overall feeling is an ideal hotel that is very suitable for traveling with family. The style is very unique, but it will not feel outdated. The area is relatively large, it is suitable for walking in the hotel and taking pictures, especially suitable for bringing parents to experience.

Environment: A very distinctive resort hotel, with lush green plants in the courtyard, small bridges and flowing water in the south of the Yangtze River, full of beautiful autumn scenery, next time I hope to see clear river water and a cleaner environment.
Service: Most of the waiters are kind and polite. Unfortunately, some waiters did not respond when they communicated with him during breakfast, and they were unhappy. I hope to strengthen the training.

Zhu Yingduo at the front desk is attentive, very warm, very patient, always smiling, which makes our stay more comfortable, and will come to this hotel often in the future, it is worth recommending, thank you very much.
       It turned out that we only booked an ordinary twin room, and then we were upgraded to a villa type house. There is a living room, a large bed, and a very large toilet. My favorite is the children's room. The children at home like it very much, the height of the table is just right, and the painting and homework are great.
       The surroundings of the hotel are very nice. Weeping willows gently caressed the surface of the river, sparkling under the sunlight, as beautiful and elegant as a veil. There is a kind of artistic conception of Jiangnan water town.
       Service is also good. We stayed during the Mid-Autumn Festival and were given mung bean cakes and moon cakes. (Several pieces have been eaten in the picture) The hotel environment is large, you can call a shuttle to the lobby or other places. The scenery along the way is also refreshing.
       We also took the awning boat before we checked out. The awning boat swayed, as if it had entered a fairy tale, and the water was very clear.
 Very satisfied with this stay. Thank you Dayu Guantang for bringing us a comfortable experience!

msg:Since my parents are celebrating their 40th anniversary, I chose Shaoxing, which is not far away by car, as one of the tourist cities. Among the many hotels, Dayu Kaiyuan with the characteristics of the water town was selected. Although the weather was unfortunate and coincided with the impact of the typhoon, the living environment of Dayu Kaiyuan and the reception level of the waiters warmed us up. On the day of check-in, Song Tiantian, the assistant manager of the lobby, called us in advance to come from Shanghai and need to navigate south to Shaoxing. He also arranged a festive red bed cover in advance and prepared welcome fruits and bouquet arrangements. The service had arrived before anyone arrived. We booked a courtyard villa, and we were also upgraded to a riverside courtyard villa (Phase II). The villa has a quiet environment. If it is sunny and sunny, Linjiang can still drink tea, so happy.
The hotel's main building for check-in has a gym and swimming pool. After check-in, a battery car will be specially delivered to the door of the villa. Little brother Wang Shiwei is very enthusiastic, not to mention when he was sent to the designated location, because his parents were old, he also helped with various luggage and helped him to get on and off the bus. Not to mention his enthusiasm, his sense of service was also very good.
The local Shaoxing eats lunch earlier, and many places end the meal at 13:30. We chose the hotel's noodle shop nearby. The noodles are not very friendly to the elderly, and they are hard. It is recommended that the gnocchi is soft and sticky. Dinner was chosen in the hotel's Yu Family Courtyard. The dishes were flawless, but it was raining outside, there were many mosquitoes, and it was stuffy without the air conditioner. The environment of the hotel can be said to be very good. The quaint street view and the tasteful village design make people who can only live in the hotel in typhoon days have a different feeling.

The girl at the front desk was very gentle and said yes, and asked us if we wanted to stay for a period. It is still the second phase (the first phase is a transformation of an ancient village, which has a special feeling, and the second phase is a modern new building). Seeing that it was difficult for us to decide, the little girl said that she could take us to see the rooms in Phase 1, and then called a shuttle bus to take us to Phase 1. The little girl at the front desk of the first phase was as gentle and friendly as always, and took the initiative to show us two types of rooms. As a result, the one we liked seemed to be a garden villa, but I didn't expect to upgrade us directly for free. The house is estimated to be 100 square meters, with its own patio (pictures 7 and 8), and it is very comfortable to live in. The first phase itself is a water town. Because the weather was too hot, we did not go to the scenic spots outside, but went straight to the first phase of the ancient village. There were few people and the environment was good, and it felt very good. The hotel transportation is also very convenient. If you drive by yourself, it is not far from the Pingshui Expressway exit. Adjacent to the Mausoleum of Dayu, it can be counted as a scenic spot. There are many trail signs within a short drive, which is very suitable for country tours. The hotel itself is not far from the city, just a 10-minute drive away. But the juices in the breakfast buffet are even better if they are freshly squeezed!

I had an idea for a long time, and I must come and stay for a few days if I have the opportunity. This year's wish came true. My daughter took the subway to the Dayu Kaiyuan Guantang Hotel. A taxi from the subway station to the hotel is 16 yuan, which is quite cheap. If you don‚Äôt want to take a taxi, you can take the subway to Lu Xun‚Äôs hometown station. You can take No. 30 and get off at Wangjiaqiao Community. Hotel; you can also get off at Chengnan Avenue Station and take Kuai 63, but Kuai 63 has a time slot.
    I stayed in the Guantang balcony twin room for the recuperation. Because it was not booked on the website, I will write about it. The balcony room is quite big, but the room we stayed in happened to be at the end of the corridor, next to the balcony. On a road, usually cars and people come and go, it is not very convenient, but the only advantage of this room is that the balcony is very large and the sun is very good. Laundry is very comfortable to dry.
    Stayed at Dayu Kaiyuan Guantang Hotel for 4 nights, my daughter and I both fell in love with this hotel, so after the unit recuperation, we deliberately booked a river view courtyard villa at our own expense. The room in this villa is quite large and the door is open Entering is a living room with sofas, TVs, wine cabinets and so on. There is a large courtyard outside. From the courtyard of the villa, you can see the hotel's awning boat. Opposite the villa is the first phase of the villa, the first phase was rebuilt from an ancient village, and it feels relatively old; the balcony rooms and villas we stayed in were both in the second phase, and the second phase was more modern.
   We live in 628. After completing the formalities in the lobby, there will be a shuttle bus to take us to the room. Of course, you can also walk there by yourself. The villa we stayed in was quite close to where we had breakfast, just a few steps away. The villa is a big bed. My daughter and I sleep just fine. There is a bedside table and a TV in the room. The toilet and bathing area are separated. The washbasin is also quite large. There is no hand sanitizer in the room, and now there are no disinfection items in the room during the special period.
    The villa I booked was given a welcome fruit. There was an episode in the middle. When I entered the villa, I suddenly found that the drinks in the refrigerator in the room had not been taken. We went out to play, but on the way, the front desk of the hotel called and said that the facial cleanser was forgotten in the original room again, and asked the waiter to bring it over for us. At this time, the supervisor of the room service depar**ent called me. I originally wanted the waiter to directly Just put the facial cleanser at the door, but the head of the room service depar**ent told me to let the waiter put it back in the room, and at the same time gave me a piece of fruit and snacks, which is really thoughtful! In the evening, the front desk called to ask me if I was satisfied with my room and what I needed. Because of the room we stayed in, the shower head above my head would leak water from time to time, so I told the front desk when I called and asked them to come when we checked out. After overhauling, we asked the housekeeper to send us a small snack in the evening. The service of this hotel is really good. This hotel is definitely a hotel that I will brush twice or three times.
   There is also an ironing board and iron in the wardrobe of the villa, just in time to iron my daughter's clothes in the morning.
   It's just that there is no coat hanger for drying clothes in the large courtyard of the villa, just like the balcony twin room, it is best to put one outside the courtyard. In addition, there is no desk in the whole villa room, which is not very convenient for children to do homework or something.
 Summary: The hotel has a beautiful environment, convenient transportation, rich breakfast, the hotel has a awning boat, the experience activities are also very good, the facilities and equipment are very good, the rooms are clean, and the epidemic prevention work is also in place, especially the room attendant Wang Hongmei, Shengtianshan service Passionate, great. In addition, Xu Ting at the front desk of the Kuaiji Building should also be commended. From the first day we checked in to the last day we checked out and went home, she was very enthusiastic. On the first day, she helped us with our luggage and took us to the room, and explained to us all the way. Check out the hotel's facilities; she also took the initiative to help us get our luggage into the car on the last day of check-out, praise! And every waiter in Kuaiji Building will take the initiative to say hello with a smile when they see the guests, thank you!

Kaiyuan Group‚Äôs hotels have no doubt about the experience they have accumulated in procurement and operation. Enjoy their knowledge and expertise.

Before check-in, Song Tiantian, the deputy manager of the lobby of the hotel, arranged in advance to help upgrade the room. Tiantian always appears when and where I need it, and her caring service touches me. The room is great, I especially like the sketches outside the window, whether it is osmanthus, bamboo or plantain, the small courtyard leads to the river bank, giving people the feeling of being empty. The hotel staff are very nice and friendly, and Huang Haonan at the front desk checked in very quickly. Special thanks also to the housekeeper Li Hongchun for the fresh fruits.

I booked 2 suites and arrived at the lobby at 2pm. When I checked in, I was told that there was one room that had not been cleaned. A group of 9 people went to 317. Fortunately, there were two rooms. The small living room did not feel particularly crowded, but it arrived. The other room hadn't been cleaned until 4 o'clock, the waiter gave 4 coupons from Yujia noodle restaurant as compensation
The housekeeper Liu Yaxin of 317 is very good, and the cleaning is diligent. Because 317 lives in the elderly at home, there are many problems, but the housekeeper is also very patient to solve the problems one by one, and his attitude is also very good, like one!
The amount of noodles in Yujia Noodle House is really big, girls may not finish eating, the taste is quite normal, at least not to step on the thunder, the amount of rice is regular
The second set of Vanilla Photography is half price during the eleventh period, and the first set is 499. Pippi photographer is very cute. It makes the children very happy, and the shooting effect is also very good.

To be honest, the charge for such an expensive room is indeed shocking to me. Poverty limits I
There is a awning boat in the hotel to reach the Dayu Tomb, 75 for a single trip, 150 for a round trip, and it takes less than 10 minutes to arrive. The children are still very happy by boat. Tickets for Dayu Tomb are relatively humane, and half price for students over 60 years old. , The charges are reasonable, although the scenic spots are relatively simple, there are 957 steps, and there is a viewing platform and the statue of Dayu after going up the mountain. The awning boat can also go to the lotus pond, the fare is higher
You need to scan the QR code once a day to get in and out of the hotel‚Äôs parking lot, so there is no charge
Generally speaking, the experience is good, the hotel‚Äôs service is quite good, the staff are very polite and take the initiative to greet, the rooms in the first phase do not match the price.

The renovation of ancient buildings in the Ming and Qing Dynasties, the unique scenery of small bridges and flowing water in the south of the Yangtze River, are everywhere in the background for taking pictures. The Dayu Tomb Scenic Area is separated from the hotel by a small river, and the hotel has a awning boat to go directly to the scenic area, which is super convenient.

The room is very clean and does not smell of decay. I like the gift dolls. The garden environment is very good, the hotel is large, there are all kinds of eating, drinking, and fun. You can also make a awning boat and overlook the statue of Dayu. The breakfast is rich, the service is good, the closing time is timely, and the baby is given free fish food, and the lotus pond at the door is happy to feed the fish.

The characteristic of this hotel is that it was transformed from the old Yuling Village, with black boats, stone bridges, ancestral halls, ancient stage...a simple and elegant Jiangnan village accompanied by a winding waterway. The babbling Kunqu opera sings slowly unfolded...
I like the features here and the room service is very warm. I am staying in the second phase this time. I really want to experience the old houses with tall plantains growing in the courtyards of the first phase. I will come again next time.

msg:Originally, I didn't like to wander around the city, so although Shaoxing is famous, he hasn't come to it for a long time. It was not until the beginning of school that the baby wanted to deal with Mr. Lu Xun, and then he brought it to look for it. Unexpectedly, the reason that would make me fall in love with Shaoxing is Dayu Kaiyuan, and I think I will definitely come back. The elevated road from the high-speed rail station to the hotel is currently under construction. It is estimated that within two years, this section of the road will be shortened to 20 minutes. The hotel service, from the front desk to all kinds of service staff, are very warm and friendly, and this hotel recruits service staff, I even suspect that there is a demand for appearance, I met handsome men and women who looked friendly and polite. Probably because of the impact of the epidemic, the hotel has automatically upgraded the rooms for us to improve the guest experience. I think the boss understands this very well, and it really captured my idea of returning to stay. Pushing open the squeaky door, my son and I almost jumped up excitedly. This room completely exceeded our expectations. It was spacious, bright and full of charm. Ben was also worried about the drawbacks of the dark, humid and flavorful issue of the commentary. There were none in front of me. Instead, it gave a sense of age and depth. Later, I ran to see the second phase. They were all newly built houses. Maybe I liked the original sedimentary things, so I liked the sedimentary simplicity of the first phase. The space partition function in the room is very friendly. There are two windows around the writing desk for children to read and write. The windows are large and bright for study. The Eight Immortals table in the middle of the hall is equipped with an eye-catching window view, a small bridge with blue tiles and pink walls outside the window, antique couch sofas in the side hall, curtains on the patio of a small courtyard, and the most important bed. Two words: relieve fatigue! And successfully triggered my idea of changing the bed at home. I deliberately checked the brand and model of the mattress and verified the conscientious business again. This mattress is so expensive and a bit reluctant. Not to mention the bathroom, the bath is a view, and the picture can‚Äôt fit. Dayu outside the room, I think I can write another article, a small exquisite village with a taste of the south of the Yangtze River, strolling around here slowly, tasting tea, drinking some 15-year-old Shaoxing rice wine, addictive, but also Sent home a box. If you want to make more pottery or something, let's try it yourself. The farmer‚Äôs food in Dayu Courtyard was eaten here for three days, which was very good. The third route of the Da Ai Wu Peng Boat, to the Tomb of Dayu and then to a lotus pond, in addition to beauty or beauty, could not help being lured by his son, and traveled twice in two days. The only downside is that the small shops in the village sell too few snacks. The stinky tofu store has been looking forward to opening the door, but it did not expect it. The shortbread cookies I bought in Lu Xun‚Äôs hometown are super delicious. It would be perfect if there is a small shop selling that kind of specialty.

The overall environment is very good. Dayu Tomb is at the innermost gate of the first phase, but the gate is locked and cannot be passed directly.
The subway is being repaired in front of the hotel. I believe that after the subway is repaired, it will be more friendly to tourists and the transportation will be more convenient. Shaoxing‚Äôs scenic spots can be passed through. I believe that more friends will patronize this 2500-year-old ancient city .
The hotel staff are very nice and the service industry is very good. The facilities are also relatively complete. If it can be equipped with some new energy charging piles, I believe it will be even more competitive.

It is recommended to plant taller green plants to keep the sight of the outside, so that tourists enter the hotel as if they have entered. Peach Blossom Spring, Forget Worry

1. I feel that the busiest part of the hotel is the staff of the hotel shuttle bus, all sweating profusely and have a good attitude.
2. One of the waiters in the noodle shop was pretty good, he said [breaking tears for laughs], but we also wanted to give us good comments.
3. Agree to our late check-out to a point.
4. The hotel is not far from the former residence of Lu Xun, it's nice to walk around.

The hotel still has many shortcomings,
1. The hotel stipulates that the check-in time is four o'clock in the afternoon. We arrived at two o'clock. We waited for a long time. Although we checked in more than three o'clock in the afternoon, the time regulation was very unreasonable. There is nowhere to go on such a hot day!
2. The two young men in the pottery room have been playing games, and no one took care of us when we went in, until I asked us to sit casually? Play it by yourself? Only one male employee asked another male employee to arrange a seat for us and went to play games again within five minutes. We are still playing and they have nowhere to go. . . .
3. There was a smell of smoke in the room, the sliding door of the toilet could not be closed at all, and it was not easy to close, and it could not be opened, and someone outside needed to help it.
5. We have not checked into the room yet, the front desk let us give a good comment. . . . . .
6. The overall feeling is that the staff is a bit lazy. Although there are many staff, I don't know what they are doing. I see almost six people at the front desk every time, but I don‚Äôt know what they are up to

The house is a little old, as shown in Figures 2 and 3. The interior decoration is okay, but no matter how it is decorated, the traces of the years can not be concealed. The room lighting in the first phase of the old mansion was a bit dim. In the evening, the construction of old houses is very random, the paths are intricate, and it is easy to go wrong. After taking the child a few times, the child was timid and a little scared. Originally booked a river view villa big bed room, in this case, discuss with the front desk whether it can be replaced, the front desk is very cooperative, and changed to the second-phase river view luxury suite. It should also be explained here that the price of "River View Villa Double Room" and "River View Deluxe Suite" on Ctrip are the same, but in fact the first name is the first phase, and the latter is the second phase. Ask the customer service and the robot will reply. There is also no clear explanation, just that the area is different. It will be better if the merchant has a mark, which is convenient for booking, especially for the first time guests can choose the room type according to their actual preferences. I changed to the second-stage deluxe suite with river view, but it did not match the room type pictures on Ctrip. The room I changed to did not have a bathtub. The pictures of the hotel on Ctrip did have a bathtub, but it doesn‚Äôt matter whether it has it or not. The overall picture is much better . The second phase is newly planned and constructed, so the overall layout is very clear, the rooms are also very bright, and the central air-conditioning is very powerful. You can see the following photos. After staying for two days, I feel that there are more people staying in the second phase than in the first phase. If you are with children, it is better to live in the second phase. There are restaurants in the hotel, the price is relatively high, you can go to the Intime Depar**ent Store, 4 kilometers away, to choose more noodles. The service of the little brother lifeguard in the swimming pool in the hotel is very good. However, the management of the pool locker is a bit confusing. It is indeed a bit surprised that the same handle ring can open different boxes. Hotel breakfast is average, management is acceptable. There are small snacks in the evening, which is very considerate. There are scenic spots such as Dayu Mausoleum, Lufeng Temple and so on around the hotel, which is very convenient. The engineering depar**ent of the hotel is also very dedicated. I found that a TV set could not watch the program on the first day of staying. The waiter had come to see the repair and it was too late. The waiter asked us to report to the front desk for repairs the next day and went out in a hurry. I forgot to report for repairs, and when I came back I found that the TV had been repaired. There are awning boats on the inland river of the hotel, so you can take a ride if you are interested. Shaoxing is a good place, Kaiyuan Temple is very unique, it is worth living!

After the check-in room was finished, the room was not cleaned, and the previous guests left late. There is no other way but to understand. On a 38-degree hot day, I could not enter the room to rest. The Yu family compound was crowded with people and could only eat noodles. Unexpectedly, I had a very delicious shrimp and crab noodles.
The breakfast variety is okay, but there is no butter in the bread, only jam is the first time I have encountered it.
You can take a awning boat in the hotel, there are 3 routes to choose from, the swimming pool is not big, and there are 4 treadmills in the gym.
There is a musty smell in the room in the first phase, so you must turn on the air conditioner very low. Although choosing the first phase is to choose the quaint feeling, the musty smell really affects your mood. The small refrigerator is big enough, and the price of the drinks is high, all at 12 yuan per can.

msg:The first-phase guest rooms were remodeled for the old house, and the room types are okay and very distinctive. The scenery inside the hotel is beautiful, the service is very attentive, the attitude is good and the service is fast. Basic praise, a few comments: the quality of toilet paper is the worst at the same price, and the thin layer melts and breaks when exposed to water, which is very low in price. The bathtub is very dirty, rust, water stains and dust have not been cleaned up, and I dare not use it. The quality of toiletries I have seen is the worst at the same price. The large bottles are squeezed, the bottles are sticky, and the residual liquid used by the last tenant has not been cleaned.

msg:Advantages: 1. In the second phase of staying, the platinum member room was upgraded to a view room for free, and the quilt was thin and comfortable. My favorite is that there is a drying rack on the balcony which is very convenient.
2. Praise the housekeeper Yu Xing for contacting me the day before check-in, and sent me a location on the day of check-in, so that I can park the car in the hotel's underground parking lot and pick me up. The work is very serious and responsible.
3. Our aunt Chen Yuexian who cleans the room is also very good, because our group is 2 big and 2 young, so we always need to trouble her to send bath towels and water, praise her!
4. I like the hotel's swimming pool is very good, and it is open until 10:30 in the evening, it is the best of the four hotels I stayed at this time.
5. Platinum members have free afternoon tea and early service, etc., which is very good.
6. The noodles at Dayu Noodle House are so delicious, there are discounts on Dianping.com.
Disadvantages: 1. The bed in the room is too soft. This is a common problem in all Kaiyuan hotels. It is very uncomfortable to sleep with backaches.
2. Went for breakfast at nine o'clock in the morning of the second day of check-in. The air conditioner was broken and it was very hot, but it was not handled in time. When we finished eating at ten o'clock, the air conditioner had not been repaired. Of course this is just an episode. I hope the hotel will be repaired. Depar**ent can be improved.
3. The common problem of resort hotels, breakfast is not very good.
Generally speaking, the hotel is good, and I will be willing to stay again next time I have the opportunity.

msg:It is rare for a family to prepare to travel when they are free, so they booked this hotel on Ctrip. The small bridge in the Jiangnan water town is very beautiful. I booked a family room for the first phase, which is suitable for three people in my family. The room is large and single-family. On the side of the road, sleeping at night is very quiet. There are many people who have breakfast in the morning, but there are plenty of things. The hotel has a free parking lot. There are many battery cars in the hotel that can be called at any time if it is inconvenient to go back and forth. The front desk service of the hotel is good, and all questions are answered. There is a Yu family courtyard in the hotel. If you don't want to eat out, you can taste it. The good service and the dishes taste good, but the quantity is a bit small. Next time you have the opportunity to live in the second phase and experience it.

The swimming pool environment is great, the hotel is very suitable for taking pictures, the scenery is everywhere, and you can also wear Hanfu to take pictures. It‚Äôs great, come again in summer vacation
