The amount of water is very small. The breakfast is average. Parking is convenient. Parking is free, but you need to go to the front desk to operate it.

The front desk was not very obvious, but the staff at the front desk provided good service. The focus is on the hotel rooms. The decoration is old and the hygiene is average. The electric curtains are faulty, the room lights are faulty, the drain plug in the bathroom sink is faulty, and the air conditioning does not work... Alas, I am quite disappointed.

msg:How many times have I been here? Let’s not talk about the facilities. It’s an old store. It’s okay to have serious resurgence. At least we should provide basic services, right? My vehicle was scanned when I entered the car, and you were told to pay for parking. Why are those people at the front desk just eating dry food? There is also a male front desk man named Li. His attitude is really arrogant. How come Evergrande is so lonely and its management has plummeted? ? ? I'd like to trouble the management staff to respond when they see it. The room charge of more than 400 per night is due to your work mistakes. Why do you still ask me to teach you about the parking fee? Also, the attitude of the service industry is very important. At least there must be a system, right? I am not here to spend money to be angry. Without comparison, there is no harm to the exact same thing. How come others could respond immediately and handle it last time? Please Evergrande management reflect carefully

The hotel environment is very beautiful, the internal facilities are also good, and the hotel breakfast is also very rich. As for travel, it must be convenient to drive or have a car to pick you up.

msg:I feel like I have never stayed in an Evergrande Hotel that is worse than this hotel. First, the hotel is located in a community. To enter the community, you have to go through a dirty and messy street. Secondly, our group booked 3 rooms. The electric curtains in the 2 rooms were broken (the ones that cannot be pulled by hand), and the hotel was notified to repair them. First a worker came, but he couldn’t fix it, and then another worker came. The room was covered with floor stalls. I came in wearing leather shoes and carrying a ladder (none of my children have children’s slippers, they just took off their shoes and walked around the room in socks), and said while repairing, the hotel is too old, it can’t be repaired, it can’t be repaired... toss After a long time, one room was used up, and the other room was changed only after we proposed to change rooms! The other room was even more speechless, where two little girls lived, the air conditioner was broken, the washbasin fell straight down, the toilet kept leaking, and I asked for a maintenance worker in the middle of the night, and the workers said, let’s just use it, the hotel has been around for more than ten years... ... Speechless! Evergrande is really in decline, and I will never stay in Evergrande's hotel again.
