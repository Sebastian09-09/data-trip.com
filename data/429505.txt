The room was very clean. The pool is incredibly small, even for a city hotel. There were only 4 recliners, all taken when we arrived. We couldn’t  use the pool as the entry point was in the deep end and people were doing laps. Quite unfortunate.

It is located next to Indigo Mall, perfect for families wanting to go for a stroll around. There’s a restaurant on the 2nd floor called FEAST, this restaurant has an indoor soft play area, perfect for kids to play while mom and dad eat or drink! There’s also a smaller pool with a perfect temperature for babies! And a bigger pool for those with older goods. Had a great time staying here and we welcomed the year of the rabbit here with a visiting dragon!

Great staffs, they speak English very well I did not fee any inconvinience from language. They solved my travel problems regarding health codes and various requirements to travel China. Hotel staff Anna helped me so much by answering my questions even before my staying, and she checked if I arrived well in my destination. She packed breakfast for my family since we could not use breakfast because of urgent plan change. It was grateful when thinking that I only stay led one night at the hotel. 
Under the current situation of pandemic, this hotel must be the best one if you use Qungdao airport. 

Room condition was clean and great, big bathtub which makes you relaxed after ling travel.
Location is very close to the airport, 5 min by car. Hotel’s pick up service is worthy to use. Not sure if the hotel is directly connected to the airport for departure.

The room was a tiny with no bottle water they insisted on the filtered water next to the basin which I thought was strange. The brunch was the only thing that made the staycation worthwhile. I’d definitely recommend their brunch.

Location is great. Within walking distance of restaurants and bars such as Great Leap Brewing (best burgers in beijing May I add) and Mandrill. The hotel is attached to Indigo Mall so shopping is on your doorstep and restaurants to choose from if you don’t want to go out into the cold in the depths of Beijing winter. 
The only thing, we were sad that there was no spa at this hotel for our staycation.

The gym has 8 or 9 treadmills, which is a big scene. The swimming pool has a sauna.

The room has a strong sense of technology. I also like some of the paintings of old Beijing.

The service staff are also very enthusiastic. This time I made a reasonable but slightly excessive request, and the staff also helped to solve and satisfy it.

I feel that I will choose it for business trips or personal trips in the future.

At that time, I only had an electronic device and an emergency work. After asking for help from the hotel, the front desk manager Jane Qinyi promptly and enthusiastically provided various solutions and finally solved the problem (she also took the initiative to lend her own phone during the period). This kind of helpful behavior has far exceeded the service provided by the hotel itself, which is very respectable and touching. In addition, the hotel's doorman took the initiative to take the luggage every time he entered and left the store, which exceeded many five-star hotels of the same level in China. A big thumbs up 👍

It is very convenient and the bedding is also very good. The view of the city room is very good. I went to the fourth floor to swim this time. It was really nice when there was no one.

The ventilation of the room needs to be improved. The room I was given the first time was very damp. The service staff changed the room in time. The floor cleaning was not as good as other hotels I stayed in. I hope it will be improved. But overall, it is a hotel that matches my personal travel needs. Next time I return to Beijing, I will definitely stay at East Hotel again!

The hotel is connected to a shopping mall, which is very convenient for shopping. After checking in last time, I took my daughter to the mall to buy down jackets and snow play equipment. Last time, I had dinner with friends in the mall next to the hotel and then went to the lobby bar to drink. When I got drunk, I went upstairs to sleep. . It’s really convenient!
Moreover, the staff at the counter are all gentle and polite, and the boys at the concierge are attentive and energetic. They will help call a taxi and collect packages. It is also close to the airport~
The most important thing is that because of my special constitution, I occasionally encounter trouble in hotel rooms when I go out. This hotel has a great aura, and you can immediately feel the peaceful a**osphere as soon as you open the door. Good wind and good water~
And after entering the room, I casually touched it and found that the edge of the headboard behind the bed, a place that would hardly be noticed by guests, was actually clean and dust-free! ! EAST's housekeeping is really strong.
I rarely take photos. The photos are of the room type I stayed in last time. Among hotels of the same price range in Beijing, the EAST room is quite big! Full five points praise~

The second biggest drawback is that there is no bottled water in the room. The management doesn't know what they think. There is a pipe for direct drinking water in the toilet, but I don't dare to drink it. . . 3. There is a problem with the TV signal and the screen goes black intermittently. And you need to tilt your head to watch TV.
All in all not worth the price of over a thousand.

msg:I have stayed here before, mainly because it is convenient to be near INDIGO, and the hotel is also quiet. I have stayed here several times this year and I am not very satisfied.
First of all, washing clothes is really not that good. The last time I did laundry, I didn't get the stains out of my shirt at all. I checked in last week and washed three pieces of clothes. I didn’t look at them carefully when I left. However, when I took them out and tried to wear them in the past two days, I found that the collar of the white shirt was yellowed by the washing. This is my favorite white shirt.
Not much else to say. When I checked in, the toilet was stained and the toothbrush I was given had lint. Why is it getting worse?

Environment: The hotel has a very design feature. Although it has been well maintained for a period of time after opening, the detailed design of the room has a lot of highlights. The simple space and log furniture design, especially think about the temperament. The elevator halls on each floor from the lobby to the third floor have been carefully designed, with different lighting and materials. Many functional modules in the room are hidden, so they can be opened quickly when in use, so the room looks very simple and full of space. The quality of the bedding is good, the shower room is too big, and it is not very ventilated. The selected animals hide dirt and dirt for a long time, and there is a smell. This is the biggest shortcoming. At the same time, it lacks a bathtub.

Quite internal, the refrigerator is placed in a hidden cabinet, the curtains are all electrically controlled, and the highlight should be the heated towel bar in the bathroom.
Shower gel and shampoo are in one, one bottle for two purposes.

Location traffic:
Next to Indigo Port, it is very close. Indigo Port should be the commercial center of Jiuxianqiao, and next to it is the second phase construction site.

Breakfast: pretty good. Rich varieties, combining Chinese and Western. Especially the crispy bread for breakfast is very delicious, and it is big, compared with some of Sam's.

Restaurant: similar to the style of a large passage, without fancy layout, but it is really practical [applause][applause]
In order to protect the environment, not only is there no bottled water in the hotel room, but even the packaging of dental kits and razors is very simple. There is pure water that can be boiled to drink, which can be regarded as unlimited drinking. But it's next to the sink.

Hygiene: It's okay, but the baseboard under the mirror has been glued, which is a bit dangerous.
I deliberately communicated with the front desk and asked for a room on the 6th floor, plus no luggage. Take the stairs and exercise. There is an employee in a blue plaid shirt at the front desk of the hotel to help guide the way. The service is still worthy of recognition [抱打]
The room is facing the construction site, even so, it will not be too noisy to sleep.
The soft walls of the room should be washed as soon as they can be washed, as they will get dirty after a long time.

msg:It was a very disappointing experience. After arriving at the room at 12 o'clock in the evening, it was very cold. After the door-to-door inspection, the floor heating was broken. The solution given by the hotel was to add an extra quilt and a heater. I caught a cold after sleeping overnight. The hotel did nothing to make up for it. It is unreasonable to still charge the original price of the executive suite.

I really couldn’t find the wardrobe and refrigerator. The hotel parking is free for the first four hours after getting the parking coupon. Afterwards, it costs 2 yuan per hour to park for a day, and it’s only 40. It’s very convenient to have a meal and go shopping with the Indigo shopping mall. I will stay here next time

msg:It rained on the weekend and I happened to be in Wangjing for business, so I decided to find a hotel and stay with the baby for two days. It saved me a lot of trouble. I chose EAST for half a day because it was next to a shopping mall and I didn’t have to go outside to eat and hang out. However, the only two reasons for recommending this hotel are transportation and breakfast. The service facilities are very average, and the price/performance ratio is extremely low. I'm sorry for the price of more than 1,000, which may be slightly higher during the summer vacation. It's really not worth it. First of all, the facilities are relatively old, and disposable items are not provided as they are claimed to be environmentally friendly, so it is not suitable for people who suddenly decide to stay in a hotel. It is very inconvenient, but there are no anti-slip mats for bathing and showering... Why are ordinary rooms not provided? Hundreds of chain hotels I dare not not provide this. Are you responsible if I fall? Can I be exempted from liability by writing a reminder? What an irresponsible businessman. The floor hygiene is also very average and hair is visible. As for the environment, there is a large construction site for the second phase right outside the window. I don’t want to open the curtains. The TV and bed are placed at a 90-degree angle. Although the TV can be adjusted, it is very inconvenient. Let’s talk about the service. I asked for a pair of children’s slippers. I had to wait for more than half an hour, but a pair of size 35 or so was delivered. Are these ordinary children’s slippers? Is this what they mean by being suitable for parents and children? There are no children's toothbrushes, but fortunately you can buy them at Watsons downstairs. After taking a shower at night, I found that there were no cotton swabs or combs. I had to call them all before they were delivered. They would not give them all at once. The experience was very bad. Won't stay there again. Parking is in a shared parking lot with INDIGO. It has discounted rates and is much cheaper, but I still feel uncomfortable staying in a hotel and paying for parking... In short, I don't recommend family accommodation for family trips. It's free to go on a business trip at public expense if you don't have a lot of money.

Love their eco-friendly room cards, made of wood.
The only downside is that if you don’t have a car, it will be farther away from the central attractions

msg:Because it is connected to INDIGO, I have lived there not ten times, but seven or eight times. It can only be said that it is getting worse and worse.
I booked two rooms yesterday, one of which was not cooled by the air conditioner, the floor heating could not adjust the temperature, and the room was hot and dry. The master came to check and said that the air conditioner would not be repaired in a while, so I contacted the front desk to change rooms.
Changed to the upstairs room type, just put down the things, and saw a circle of urine on the toilet seat, it was not dried urine stains. I contacted the front desk and sent the duty manager over. After looking at the situation in Figure 1, I said that this is Wuxi that cannot be cleaned up. I let him wipe it and try it out. Picture 2 is after he wiped it. The solution was to keep switching rooms for me.
I'm really too lazy to change it with a baby, so I asked the cleaning to clean it up. About ten minutes later, a man came and wiped it with an alcohol wipe. I asked the cleaner and said he was too busy. Then a fruit plate was sent over (I didn't dare to eat it) and that's all the process.
There has been no toothbrush, etc. provided in the room, not even mineral water.
Then such a major and disgusting health incident just disappeared. won't live next time

The view was the construction site. There was a price difference between the two room types and the room layout was completely different.
Besides the hardware, the sound insulation is extremely poor, and there is no way to rest at all. The light control panel leaked electricity, and the switch charged me once. There is also a need to borrow a mobile phone charging cable. I told me twice at the front desk, and kept telling me that there was one in the room. I mentioned a few places, but I looked for it and said no. I still didn’t believe it until the third time I called The phone was delivered to the room.

The lobby, elevator public area, parking lot access, etc. are all very good, design, environment, and a**osphere. Then once in the room...the maintenance of the facilities is not enough to the standard that this hotel should have. The shower water pressure is not enough, the shower head leaks, the very large shower room is cold and I don't know why it is so big, and there is not enough other space. I don't know why the air-conditioning system provides heat and air, but it doesn't work, and there is no hot air. Is it for energy saving? The floors are about the same as those in All Seasons. ...In short, the public area and the room seem to be two design teams, as if one person suffered from schizophrenia and ran in two different directions, the unity and stability of the tonality.

The dinner is still considered to be of good quality in this price hotel. There are few varieties, but the quality is online. You will feel that only one day is good, and one day is not good.

Seeing familiar people is still very kind~

There is a new restaurant downstairs, and INDIGO has also changed some merchants ~ there are more restaurants that feel delicious. The second phase is still under construction~

During the epidemic, Beijing's restaurants and hotels were not easy, and they all received five-star praise~

msg:It was my first time staying at EAST Beijing, and I would like to talk about my feelings.
The entrance to the lobby of the hotel is very low-key, even giving people a feeling that this should not be the main entrance of the hotel, which gives people a feeling of "very narrow at first, and talented people". After entering the lobby, it is another scene. The design of the lobby is very distinctive. The concierge of the hotel is facing the door instead of the front desk. The concierge staff will ask the guests to scan the Beijing Healthbao and measure their body temperature, and they will also remind the guests not to exit the Beijing Healthbao interface for a while to check in.
The check-in at the front desk was very fast, it gave me the impression that it took no more than five minutes, and the staff were very friendly, because it was my first time checking in, so they gave me a clear introduction to the layout of my room. This is really too friendly for first-time hotel guests.
The hotel is close to the 798 Art District, and the overall artistic a**osphere is also very strong. If you like to take pictures, there are actually many places worth shooting. After checking in, you can see three works of art on the way to the room. The most eye-catching and my favorite one is a sculpture at the elevator entrance. It is really very designed, but I forgot to take a photo😓
When I arrived at the room, I felt how necessary the front desk staff were to introduce the room. The overall design of the room is hidden, but according to their descriptions, I can easily find bathrobes, slippers, mobile phone charging cables and other items that I need or may use during the trip. The layout of the room is also very reasonable. Although the room I booked is only 40 square meters, there is a clear distinction between the living area and the functional area. I think it can fully meet the needs of some long-term residents.
The concept of environmental protection and low carbon is implemented in all aspects of the hotel, from the wooden room card to the six small pieces that are all packaged in environmental protection, and then to the packaging bags for biscuits, it is difficult to see plastic products. In addition, the texture of the razor with the wooden handle is very good. It is hard to believe that this is a disposable razor, but the wooden handle is a little slippery when it gets wet with water, but the flaws are not concealed.
The equipment in the gym is great, the number of stationary equipment is arguably the largest variety in a hotel I've seen, not just a few treadmills and a few dumbbells that are better than nothing.
There are many kinds of breakfast. I tried egg rolls. The chef's craftsmanship is great~

msg:On a whim, I didn't go home directly after returning to Beijing from a business trip🏠.

T3 called a car and went straight to the EAST Hotel, which has been planting grass for a long time🏨.
Originated from Xinxinian’s earlier review in the comments: the city skyline view under the floor-to-ceiling windows🕌.

🌳 Room view.
The lady at the front desk was super nice and learned that I made a special trip to check in the hotel🎡, and upgraded my room from EAST room to corner room.

The 270-degree city skyline view is not too perfect ❤️.

Checked in at 22:30 at night, it was dark outside the window.
After the sunrise the next day, I was shocked by the color of the sky and the magnificence of the city 🌈.

🛏️Room facilities.
Frequent travel makes people tired, so I experienced a bubble bath before going to bed🫧. Hot water ♨️ is extremely satisfying. Harvest a beautiful sleep😪.

The bath 🛁 has been checked beforehand, and the sanitation of the bathtub is acceptable. I brought alcohol and wet wipes for careful disinfection.

🥐Breakfast.
The room type does not include breakfast, take out 🥡from the favorite The Daily Bagel's 🥯➕☕️, and enjoy the beautiful high-rise window view Brunch🥞.
The Loch Ness Monster 🥯 is full of tuna 🐟 and soft-hearted eggs 🍳. After eating it, I start to miss it.

No late check-out, after checking out on time at 12:00 noon, call a car directly to go home🏡.
I feel that this stay has fully recharged myself 🔋.

Secondly, the room is spacious, fully functional, separated from dry and wet, and suitable for movement and stillness. The old hotel facilities are relatively new and clean. The room temperature in Beijing for three or nine days is 26.5, which is very suitable for me. Furthermore, the supporting scene area is also great. The gym is relatively well-equipped, clean and spacious; the overall environment of the restaurant is clean and spacious, there are many types of breakfast dishes, and the service staff are very dedicated and enthusiastic.
The quality of the staff is very high, and they take good care of me as a patient who has undergone eye surgery. In particular, the account manager Shirley Zhou took the initiative to help me coordinate various services. At the same time, I also thank the waiters in the restaurant for their care, and thank you little brother for the iced American , Thank you to the little brother on duty who helped me deliver the food. In the difficult 22 years, it is the kindness of every ordinary person that adds warmth to the end of 22 years and brings confidence to the new year. Finally, I would like to thank East Hotel, Shirley Zhou, and all the staff for giving me a very warm experience.

I booked 2 rooms, but the single bed was large, so I thought it would have been ok to book only 1 room.
It was nice to have a sauna at the pool.
However, the shower room and toilet were dirty and smelled throughout.
I went expecting the famous breakfast, but I was completely disappointed.
I know it's because of Corona, but I was completely disappointed because there was so little food.

I don't understand why the room doesn't even have a bathtub, and there is no place to cover and change clothes when taking a shower. The rationality of the design needs to be considered, and it feels like a fast hotel.
Because of the epidemic, the swimming pool cannot be used, but there is no explanation on the page. I just want to take my children to swim.

First, there is no robot to deliver the takeout to the room. If you have to go to the front desk to take it in person, the waiter will not help to deliver it, which is very inconvenient. Two days ago, I was lying in bed with acute gastroenteritis and struggled to go downstairs to get medicine. This service is not in place, compared with the hotels I have stayed in before, it is quite poor.

Second, there was suddenly nothing to eat in the restaurant for breakfast, and all of them were replaced with small set menus for one person. Had to go to the mall next door to eat or order takeaway.

Suggestion: The management went to other hotels to study and study, and the service awareness is still a bit poor.

But it's just a big construction site outside, which is a bit horrible! Environmental awareness is popular now, so hotels are not equipped with disposable items (including toothbrushes, razors, combs, disposable shower caps, etc.), just ask the front desk to get them if you need them. However, bottled water is recommended, otherwise you have to wait to boil the water in the store. The hotel has a direct drinking water outlet with a German Birand filter element. It is more comfortable to drink. After all, the house also uses Birand, the room is soundproof and the mattress is comfortable enough, but the pillows do not have many height options, and the current pillows are soft , I used to sleep with latex pillows and my neck felt a little uncomfortable the next day. The hotel has a gym and a swimming pool. You can't experience it without sports equipment. It would be better if there are children's activities. Generally speaking, the experience is not lost, and the same price may choose other hotels to try, and there is no urge to have a second brush.

I gave mineral water before, but now I have to drink it straight. During the epidemic, I really don’t want to drink straight water. I don't know if the filter system has been changed, or what the previous tenant did with that faucet.

There is no bathtub either. Unbeatable prices. It's really unnecessary. Budget location to live all season or something, there are too many choices for high budget.

Ask them for an alcohol pad and tell me no. I thought that alcohol pads are now standard equipment in hotels.

msg:I stayed at the EAST Hotel on May Day. Because it is an excessive hotel, the price is very cheap. It is almost as expected. Let’s talk about the advantages first. The price is relatively close to the people. The gym is very distinctive but unfortunately I have no experience. The hotel’s breakfast is really quite good. appelles is also very good and the service is quite satisfactory. The shortcomings are mainly in terms of hardware. As a five-star hotel, the lack of a bathtub is really a problem, and we are not staying in a basic room. The hotel room space arrangement is not reasonable, a bit depressing, but considering the price is still acceptable. However, the construction site at the back really affects the image score. Generally speaking, no work has been done.

msg:This is a complicated matter, but there are no more replies, so I can only say that the management of INDIGO Group and EAST Hotel is disappointing. During the National Day, I booked a hotel for three days, thinking about going to relax. The hotel has parking service every night, so every time you enter the underground parking lot. It was around one o'clock that night, and I had just returned after eating outside. The road into the road was a two-lane lane. Once I entered and exited, the entrance was blocked by a simple bucket, and the exit was normal traffic. I naturally thought of the possibility It was only temporarily closed, because there were no notices and no one to guide them, so they naturally drove in another direction. This is a slope of about 30 degrees. I drove to an average level. Before I reached the entrance, I heard a male voice shouting, "Don't drive any further! If you drive any further, you will start losing money!" I stopped the car at that time. I was halfway up the slope, and then I politely asked the man, a middle-aged uncle in cleaning clothes, "Can't you go?" Then the man began to curse and say, "Go one step further, crush the You will pay for that spray gun right away!" I said patiently (because it was after 1 o'clock in the middle of the night, and I really didn't have much strength) "Then can I drive to the right and enter the parking lot? He continued to curse and said angrily, "no! Can't you come in without looking? ! ’ I said, ‘Can we have a good talk? In the middle of the night," he continued to curse, saying, "If you can't go, you can't go! I said, "This side is not closed, and this is a slope, I can go to the empty side, can I?" ’ He went on to say, ‘It doesn’t work! " Then a security guard came and told me to back up. I said it was a slope. How could I go back up? Finally, the security guard moved the old man's bucket and asked me to back up the car. The old man went over and whispered to the security guard, meaning don't Just ignore me, let me go back like this. What kind of life can make this uncle so rampant? Of course I told the hotel later, and the hotel also told INDIGO. Give me a call. Do not give bad reviews, this kind of management cannot be tolerated, sorry.

Many people at the front desk smiled and responded with "Ah, there are bugs", but there is no more? ? ? ? ? At that time, I really didn’t care about it. Does this service really deserve this price?

msg:It’s the first time I visited the Toyo Hotel. It’s not bad for the people who stay in the hotel from time to time every month. The only drawback is that the toiletries are not provided with cotton swabs. Also, I knock on the door every morning to ask about laundry services. The purpose of the hotel is to sleep until the person who wakes up naturally is a kind of annoyance. The waiter in the breakfast section does not take the initiative to ask if you need coffee. This is the first time I met and did not ask. The sound insulation is poor. I was awakened by a pair of men and women talking loudly in the corridor at about 4:50 in the morning, and this was the case after 5 o'clock, which seriously affected the quality of sleep in the accommodation.

After cleaning up at three o’clock and entering the room, anyway, I won’t go there next time.

在將台站附近的一家五星
酒店本身試圖彰顯的藝術屬性。 在頤提港這種商場旁邊，有這樣一家好喝好看很安靜的咖啡廳，已經非常值得一去。
酒店的logo像是小恐龍，裝修也很有特色，比較反常識的一點是，這家酒店的電梯是沒有第五層的，一般的五星樓層設計可能會避開4，但是這一家避開了5。
設施：👍👍👍
衞生：👍👍👍
環境：👍👍👍👍
服務：👍👍👍👍

早餐相對於同等級酒店選擇很少.還好住2天，要是3天我就選不出東西吃了.
房間內用過濾水而沒有礦泉水比較詫異.
服務OK，健身房小哥説下次用健身房要預約，什麼鬼？不明白.健身房門口台階極易摔跤.
性價比不高，下次不會入住.

1、交通很方便，跟旁邊的商場頤堤港衹通過一個小門連接，頤堤港下面就是14號線地鐵
2、頤堤港裏有很多餐廳，我們的房型沒有含早餐，想着酒店的自助都差不多，7歲的孩子也吃不了什麼，沒有額外訂早餐，每天早上在商場的多樂之日買早餐，好吃又划算
3、2樓的Domain咖啡廳棒呆，靠窗的位置要早點預訂或佔位，下午茶198超級划算，顏值高，且鹹甜搭配很適宜，每一種點心口感都做得細膩豐富，有用心。
都説北京的服務不比南方，但這個酒店所遇的服務人員都很温柔，有禮，耐心。

説説建議:花灑的水有點小，洗頭很不舒服，可能是高樓水壓比較低？另外是不是可以信用住免按金？當然按金目前退款也是非常快速，1分鐘的事情。
門口14號線去南站也很方便，以後來還會住這裏！

The hotel said we didn't have it. Did you lose it yourself?* ***, I gave you the facial cleanser. I’m really speechless. I originally stayed in other hotels and could delay the delay to 4 pm and get points. My friend, your hotel design is very good. I came. I asked to return at 2 o’clock. I felt that it was It's not good for you and there are many people on weekends. Hurry up and check out the housekeeping depar**ent to clean up. There is no facial cleanser.

msg:It's very close to the subway station, next to the shopping mall (haven't been there yet). More convenient. I live here because I watch a football game. The bed was very comfortable. The room was big and we were upgraded. Thank you. But the disadvantage of room cleaning is that even if you press Do Not Disturb, you have to call the guest to ask if it is cleaned. It is normal to press the wrong button. When I came back that night, I was really angry that the room was not cleaned. Used takeaway, used bath towels, piled up garbage. Although we care about hygiene, the smell is very bad and the hotel has nothing to say, it is very unprofessional. I don't know if the newly opened hotel doesn't even have uniform staff uniforms, so they can still wear private clothes? Nice hotel, unprofessional staff!

He also told me confidently that it was because I turned on the do not disturb light. Really speechless, I often stayed here before the epidemic, this time I obviously feel that the service and breakfast are down to a higher level, and even the minimum cleaning of the room can be saved, which is amazing.
