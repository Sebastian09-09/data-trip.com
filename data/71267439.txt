msg:Booked elegant 2-bed room for 4 adults. 
Room design and amenities suitable for kids not adult as cup provided is more to plastic material. 
Good thing about this hotel is they provide free shuttle bus from baimajing station to hotel and vice versa but information not provided clearly and I have to keep calling front counter to ask. Attached is the bus that took us to island in case you are going. Better confirm with the driver before boarding. 
Not much shop open for breakfast so we opted for hotel breakfast. Breakfast is not up to my family standard, mantou is hard like rock even it’s taken from the steam basket. 
Frankly speaking, will not go second time to the island as really nothing much except the building design.

Just that there were too many travelers, even it's working day. There were a lot of staff, but not enough at all. Had to queue up for check in&out quite long. But all staff, from bellboys to reception, were helpful.

-1 for amenities because there were no fabric slippers and the rubber ones were wet.

My son was so happy,  he slept in big train. Breakfast was delicious and you can choose the time in the morning from 7-11h . Room is very big and clean, fruit was waiting for us afternoon .the only  disadvantage is that taxi can't drive directly to this hotel. You need to use public free shuttle bus from the parking, and it's uncomfortable with luggage and kids.

msg:We stayed in two parts of the hotel; the single-storey villa and in the suite. 

It’s important to know that the villa is not in the same place as the hotel, and you do not have access to the facilities, including the restaurant and bar. The villa is 30 minutes walk from the hotel but you do have access to a golf cart driver. 

We did not know this when we booked, so we only stayed in the villa for one night, then moved to the main hotel for the second night. 

I would like to give special mention to two people; Mr Sky Yang and Ms Tiffany. These two people made our trip extra special. 
Firstly, Mr Sky made sure that a vehicle was always available to us. He went above and beyond to make sure we had a great experience; collecting us from the car park and driving us around the site. He was always prompt, punctual and courteous and we are extremely grateful for all his hard work. 

Secondly, Tiffany in reservations helped us fix the problem when we needed to change our reservation to move to the hotel so that we could rejoin our friends. She went above and beyond in every way, even answering my messages on her day off (we didn’t realise she was not at work). Tiffany helped resolve a tricky situation and made sure our holiday was saved and that we were able to rejoin our friends. 

Huge thanks to Mr Sky and Ms Tiffany! 

Regarding the villa, it is beautiful, clean and very private. The only negative is that you are a long way from everything else. You can use the very effective driver service but it’s important to know what to expect, that you are not near to the other facilities, and all good and drink is via room service. 

The bedroom, living room and dressing room are well equipped, and we loved the steam room and sauna within the bathroom. An unexpected bonus! 

The inside tub and outside pool are both very large and spacious. They fill very quickly and the water temperature is customisable to your tastes. 

I would definitely return to the villa another time for a romantic break. 

The castle is very different! The rooms are themed based on the tower. We stayed in the Glacier tower. I loved the turquoise and polar bear theme! The hotel is very child-friendly and lots of fun. The decor is very colourful and beautiful with lots of comfy chairs to sit on in the public spaces. 

The bed was very comfortable and the suite was lovely. 

I would stay in both these locations again. Hopefully this review can help you choose which is the right place for you!

You don’t arrive in front of the hotel to check in, no, you drive into a huge underground parking space and you take an electrical cart drive to the hotel entrance. And there in the lobby you are received by a princess and acrobats. Crazy! A dreamland for kids, but also for adults. We had a very nice ice bear room with a nice view. Inspite of so so many people we had a great and affordable dinner in the hotel and aswell a very nice breakfast. In the morning we needed organisational help by the hotel staff, and Ashley and her colleagues really were very helpful and patient. Definitely a place to stay again to see all the things and attractions offered, for which we didn’t have time.

msg:I was particularly moved at Haihua Island Bay. The only difference between here and Disney is the "princess 👸". The beauty here is distorted, but it needs more IP and content to stimulate the space for commercial value.

The castles, hotels, entertainment facilities, catering, shopping, and services here are not inferior to those of Disneyland Paris and Europa.

It is a kind of great and lonely sense of desolation, which is shrouded in the regret of the past glory, but also mixed with a bit of regret that the present is different from the past.

But has it really been "different from the past"?

Maybe it's the best at this time. There is no need to queue up in the scorching sun. There are special cars to pick up and drop off every water project. You can go to play more projects at any time. An ice cream in the park is 20 yuan, and a cup of coconut milk is 25 yuan. The cost performance is sincere enough. Although not all projects are open all day at any time, the arrangements are also very reasonable. Basically, you can play them all in order. Little treasures can also have fun. Adults are even more excited. I played in the water world for a whole day and an afternoon, which was super exciting. We watched various cute animal performances in the Ocean World according to the schedule. I cried a lot when I watched the white whale performance. It was very amazing. Before watching the dolphin performance, the big screen repeatedly played news events about people rescuing dolphins, which earned me another wave of tears. The harmony between man and nature and the underlying thinking of animal protection are all taken care of. The arrangement of these details and the output of values ​​can make the travel more meaningful.

It is particularly worth mentioning that the service. I often refuse to answer strange calls, but after booking the European Castle, I picked up Zhenyu's call from the European Castle Hotel. The next step is to start a full-time caring butler journey. Zhenyu's information is very timely, and the itinerary recommended for us is also very reasonable.

The three-day and two-night trip to Haihua Island was very happy. The hotel is super beautiful! The breakfast is very rich! The dinner is also very good! It is a good choice for family travel! It really won't step on the pit! You can come to play decisively. It's worry-free and super value. In addition, when you come to Haihua Island, you can really understand the greatness of the infrastructure of a big country!

Our Haihua Island should not be inferior to Disneyland Paris and Europa at all. I hope Ocean Flower Island will be better. 🌺

Ocean Flower Island is as beautiful as I imagined, but I didn't expect the Oubao Hotel to be so dreamy. It feels like a huge fairy tale world. The little fairies inside can let me take pictures all day long. Every angle is very beautiful. I changed two sets of clothes to take pictures. The little princess at the entrance of the hotel is very consistent with the theme of the hotel. The one wearing the princess dress is the hotel's beautiful Yuqing. She is smiling and cooperates with us to take pictures. This time I stayed in the Glacier Castle, which is the blue I like, with a prominent theme and very refreshing. After checking in, the housekeeper 33 added WeChat and answered various questions throughout the whole process. Such service is still a surprise. The hotel lobby bar is also very beautiful and the environment is very good.

The natural scenery can be said to be green trees and vines, swaying and draped. In the evening, there is a beautiful sunset on the sea viewing platform, which makes people feel relaxed and happy; the cultural landscape is even more beautiful. There is not only a castle-style hotel with a magnificent shape, but also a banquet hall with rugged bones and buds waiting to bloom, and a characteristic commercial street with ancient and modern characteristics. I am a graduate of architecture and am dazzled.

Location: Located in the center of Ocean Flower Island, it cannot be said to be close to the scenic area, but it is in the center of the scenic area. If you drive, you can reach any scenic spot in Ocean Flower Island in 5 minutes, which is very convenient.

Facilities: The hotel has complete facilities and equipment. It can be seen that the managers have been attentive both during the planning and construction period and in the later operation process. The only drawback is that the room for this trip has floor-to-ceiling windows and cannot be opened, which is a bit regrettable;

Service: The service definitely exceeds the five-star standard. The lobby manager Zhao Jinge contacted me by phone before I checked in to understand the situation of the travelers and arranged the desired room in advance; after checking in, he was very knowledgeable and answered any questions and needs at any time. If the hardware of the hotel and Haihua Island is expected, then such a thorough butler service is even more surprising.

I hope that the business of Oubao Hotel will be prosperous in the future and get better and better

msg:This time, the hotel happened to have a big meeting, and the lobby was really crowded, but fortunately the hotel has a great guarantee for the check-in experience of individual guests. First of all, individual guests were concentrated in a tower, and the hotel manager contacted us in advance. The hotel manager Zhenyu called us in advance to learn the detailed time of our check-in and confirmed the room number in advance. We checked in quickly after arriving at the store, and recommended a time period with fewer people dining for us, ensuring our breakfast experience. Xiaochun, the staff in the lobby, also left a deep impression on me. He recommended many beautiful check-in spots for us and also prepared floral water attentively. I hope that this level of service can be maintained in the future.

msg:Overall, I am quite satisfied. The scenery on the island is beautiful, the color combination is refreshing and makes people feel happy. If you have time, you can stay for two more days. The consumption on the island is not as high as it is said on the Internet. In the scenic area, it is generally reasonable. The most satisfactory thing is the service of the hotel. Every staff member will take the initiative to wave. Xiaochun took the initiative to chat with us and told us a lot of fun places. The room is indeed a bit small, but it is fully equipped, which did not affect our mood. After checking in, the housekeeper Zhao Bo contacted us. After leaving the hotel, I found that two sunny boys were added on WeChat. Thank you.

msg:Aobao Hotel is awesome!
It was my first time staying at Aobao Hotel. I must give a thumbs up to the staff. The day before I checked in, Manager Jin Ge in the lobby called me in advance. At first, I thought it was a scam. Manager Jin Ge asked us how we came, whether we drove, and how many people we had. After learning that we were bringing children, he chose a desert castle with a tent for me. My kid liked this room very much and had a lot of fun.
Later, the staff Xiao Qiu kept introducing us where to go and how to play. Great!
The hotel room is not as small as it is said on the Internet. I feel very comfortable. The hygiene in the room is clean, the facilities are neat and tidy, and it is spotless. The configuration in the room completely echoes the magnificent lobby and appearance. It is a luxurious feeling, which makes people live comfortably. As soon as I enter the room, I feel that I have come to the right place.
It is really great. I will definitely come again in the future

Although Haihua Island is very large, it is very clean, comfortable, and the greening is well done 👍; there are many flowers on the island in this season, which are super beautiful. One shot is a blockbuster. I suggest that everyone can come to check in; this time I want to praise the Oubao Hotel, which surprised me. The housekeeper Zhenyu contacted me before I arrived at Oubao and sent me the hotel location. There were not many people in the lobby. The girl at the front desk was very enthusiastic and had a bright smile. The manager Shanshan gave us floral water, which was very considerate. She explained the island's explanation and the open paradise to us in detail. The overall feeling was very good.

After arriving at the hotel lobby, we had quite a lot of luggage, so we met the lobby manager Huang Penghui at the gate. He took the initiative to help with the luggage and facilitated check-in. Since it was our first time to Ocean Flower Island, there were many things we didn't understand. He enthusiastically took a map and explained them to us one by one. It was very considerate service. After we checked in, he helped us with the luggage and guided us to the door of the room. On the way, he explained some travel information and the hotel and surrounding food places for us. He told us that if we needed any help during our stay, we could contact him at any time. We were flattered by such considerate service.

I stayed in the Desert Castle this time, full marks 💯; the restaurant was crowded, but Shanshan, the housekeeper, said in advance that there were a lot of people, so we staggered the dining time. Overall, it was okay and acceptable. I give a thumbs up to Miss Shanshan here; the scenery on the island is good. Although it rained, the water park was still open. I highly recommend it. Unlimited entry is really good, the price is reasonable, and I will definitely go! I finally understand why so many people come to Ocean Flower Island for New Year's Eve. The fireworks on May Day are so beautiful, which makes this May Day a perfect ending. Let's watch the fireworks again for New Year's Eve in 2025 [Fireworks][Fireworks][Fireworks]

As a result, I found that the hotel was crowded and I couldn't check in for half a day. There was no place to park the car at all. It took more than ten minutes to walk from the parking place to the hotel lobby. Not only was I exhausted, but when I arrived at the lobby, I found that the hotel had not received the order yet. It would take more than half an hour, and I moved the luggage to the car. I was ready to change hotels and canceled online, but the hotel didn't allow me to cancel. I had no choice but to return to the hotel half an hour later, and moved the luggage for more than ten minutes. Finally, I checked in. Then it was very noisy outside the door after twelve o'clock in the evening, and the sound insulation was super poor, which seriously affected my sleep. In short, the experience was extremely poor. This hotel can only be rated three stars at most.

Although there are a lot of people, the staff will assist in check-in and make reservations for wristbands. Miss Shanshan told me in advance about the large number of people, so I moved breakfast to 7 o'clock. There were not many people, and I had breakfast smoothly; the hotel has a direct bus to the Ocean Park, and the lady also reminded me of the location and time of the bus many times, which is very considerate; the white whales in the Ocean Park are so gentle and cute, and they soothe the restless hearts the most. This ticket is really worthwhile. The big pink rabbit at the hotel gate is very conspicuous, and there is a festive a**osphere [celebration]

The appointed breakfast time came, and there was no seat to be found. Almost no one ate breakfast on time, so food was wasted, and it would be better to have less food and more elaborate.

There is a multi-restaurant in the restaurant. It is recommended to separate it, so that it can be used by families with young children, families with young children, families with many children, couples or couples without children. The four generations of the same hall are divided into a safe and quiet area for couples without children.

A group of four or five families with seven or eight children is brought to a private area for these people, and the noise affects other guests. If the ring for entering the venue has already been released, those who do not keep their promise must take it to the seat. Please note that entry will be delayed and people will be seated again depending on need.

Island No. 3 is also well built, with many beautiful villas, and the blue sky and red roofs are a perfect match! Island No. 3 may be a corner that most tourists ignore. There is an endless sea on the other side, and a few large ships can be seen🚢. I hope that the operation team of Ocean Flower Island can make the children's world as soon as possible. I believe it will attract more and more tourists. Finally, thank you again for the careful company of Butler Xiaochun. Thank you, this thoughtful brother🫰

Finally, we found the ring in the corner of the mattress. We can feel that they are sincerely standing from the perspective of our customers, anxious about the guests' needs and thinking about what the guests think. We hereby praise them.
This recovery has made us have a better impression of Haihua Island. We stayed here for two days and felt like we were staying in a world garden. We saw the characteristic buildings of various countries here, which shows the ingenuity of the designers at that time. I would also like to make a suggestion here: I hope that the leaders of Haihua Island can provide more affordable transportation for our tourists.

Although I encountered some minor problems at the beginning, I was fortunate to meet the timely help and solutions of the two hotel managers, which made our trip perfect. I am very grateful to Manager Shanshan and Manager Zhenyu of Oubao! This time we stayed in the Desert Castle. The room was really small, and the window could not be opened. It was indeed a bit uncomfortable and disappointing when I went in. Fortunately, the hotel manager contacted me in time, adjusted a room with windows for us in time, and visited us to introduce the whole island for us. Thank you for their professionalism and responsibility. Later, we bought a small train to travel around the island. It should be the off-season. There were not many people on the island. It was a bit deserted, but the scenery along the way was very good. At night, I watched the light show as suggested. It was not as amazing as I imagined, but it was still acceptable for free. The performance of Dream Back to Dunhuang at night was good, but it was strange why the performance of Dunhuang was held on Hainan Island. The contrast was a bit strong.
Haihua Island is generally very good, and the cost performance of Oubao Hotel is also very high. If you have a limited budget on Hainan Island, you can choose to play here.

In addition, before arriving at the store, the butler contacted and told how to get there, how to play on the island, and the service during the store was quickly satisfied. This is something that I have never experienced in many star-rated hotels. I really thank Manager Xiao Han for his help and spent a pleasant holiday. The island is still very large, and it is more convenient to take a small train to play. You can go around the island. You can buy a ticket and sit for a day. It is very cost-effective. The island reveals its former glory everywhere, and various distinctive buildings can be called an international architectural expo. It is a pity that some projects have not been completed. I look forward to perfection and will definitely come to play again.

msg:The treasure island of Hainan discovered by college student special forces!!! I have been studying at the Hainan University for three years. My husband and I have always used our weekends to travel around Hainan Island, and we have visited almost all the attractions, big and small. Because the "Creation Camp" was filmed here before, we chose this island on the west line of Hainan this weekend. After playing, I found that it is worthy of being the island chosen by the treasure variety show. It is really great.
The price of the Oubao Hotel is very affordable and very friendly to our student party. In particular, the lobby manager Junyan contacted us in advance and sent us the bus schedule for the train to the hotel, which saved money and worry. I also met Manager Zhenyu in the lobby, who kindly checked us in and introduced the island's attractions. I like the two staff members~ The room is in the desert castle, the style is a bit exotic, the pillows are very comfortable, and it is a very good hotel.
At night, I was recommended to watch the sunset on the sea viewing platform. It was very romantic. I didn't expect the sunset on the west coast of Hainan to be so beautiful~ The light show of the wedding manor and the sightseeing tower at night was also good. The most favorite is the performance of Dream Back to Dunhuang. The actors and actresses are so beautiful and professional, and they dance super well. It was still very shocking to see Dunhuang on a small island in Hainan. Unfortunately, I came a few days early and didn’t experience the water kingdom of Ocean Flower Island. I will save it for next time~

Before I checked in, I received a call from the hotel manager Huang Penghui, asking us about our preferences for the room, etc. He was super meticulous and considerate. After arriving at the store, he gave me a very detailed introduction with a map, covering everything from transportation to food. I was a little surprised that a hotel of this price could have such a good service. I like him. I especially need to mention the hotel's breakfast, which is very rich, especially the Hou'an noodles are particularly delicious. I ate a bowl in the morning and satisfied the whole day. The buildings on the island are very distinctive, especially some buildings in the style commercial street, which have the characteristics of various countries and are very suitable for taking pictures! The light show of the wedding manor at night is also very good, divided into several different themes, which feels quite shocking.
The happiest thing is that there are not many people on the island now, and you don’t have to queue up to go anywhere. It is really suitable for our special forces to travel! I almost visited the whole island in two days and one night. I am very happy to choose to visit Haihua Island. I like Haihua Island and Manager Penghui~

You can also drive or take a taxi to travel around the island. It is suitable to pick up children or the elderly to play and rest here. It was a very pleasant trip and I was very satisfied. (Zhenyu)

Spectacular, when I drove to the entrance bridge of Ocean Flower Island, I was shocked by the symmetrical beauty of two tower-shaped buildings. For tourists like me who like architecture, it was completely shocking! When I approached the hotel, I was even more surprised by this castle-like hotel. It really made me dream of returning to Hogwarts. Architecture fans like me can really come to Ocean Flower Island!

msg:It was my first time to visit Haihua Island. I had been browsing it online before. After reading the reviews on Ctrip, I was mixed with joy and sorrow. But I thought that I would bring my family to Hainan, so I arranged a trip to Haihua Island. But after the experience, I really felt that the trip was worthwhile. On the way here, I received a call from Manager Zhenyu, asking us about our room preferences and providing us with a shuttle bus schedule for the high-speed rail station. Thumbs up! When checking in at the lobby, I met Manager Deng Shanshan. She learned that it was our first time here, and she gave us a super detailed introduction with a map of Haihua Island, and she completely recommended a cost-saving and labor-saving process from our perspective, which was really considerate.
After talking about the service, let's talk about the room. It's true that the room is not big, and the wardrobe and bathroom in the room are relatively simple, but it feels that the hotel at this price in the scenic area is completely acceptable. We stayed in the Desert Castle Room, which has bright colors and styles, is very distinctive, and has a little exotic flavor. The breakfast is quite rich, and the Houan powder is delicious. My children can eat a big bowl. The hotel is generally very cost-effective.
I am very happy to choose the Oubao Hotel to stay in this trip! It will definitely come later.

Everyone can dine at staggered times and go up and down the elevator on staggered floors, which makes it less crowded. No matter how staggered the breakfast times are, the number of diners is still very impressive. In fact, if you travel on holidays, you really don’t need breakfast.

The facilities are old, the air conditioning is not powerful enough, and I wake up from the heat even when I sleep. The quality of breakfast is also much worse than before. It's like a fast hotel with nothing to eat. What's even more annoying is that the restaurant was full, and the service staff didn't know how to guide us to the restaurant opposite. We walked around twice but couldn't find a seat, so we went to find the waiter. She took our whole family around the restaurant again. In the end, she couldn't find a place, so she said she had to ask the supervisor...
The only thing that felt better this time was that some of the uncles and aunties who passed by the lobby who were doing hygiene were very enthusiastic.

The first night we stayed at the Qiziwan Beach Hotel, and we enjoyed the scenery along the way and arrived at Ocean Flower Island in the afternoon. The first sight of the Oubao Hotel was amazing. I booked the low-priced Glacier Castle that was being recommended through Ctrip. When a beautiful 🦌 girl at the front desk checked me in, she found that I had booked the wrong date, and immediately contacted Ctrip to cancel the original reservation and change the date. Let the two of us "Ermao" (Su Dongpo's self-proclaimed name for mixed black and white hair) check in smoothly. I heard that I was bitten by mosquitoes, and I was arranged to the 12th floor. It was so nice, and the whole trip was made better because of this beautiful lady wearing a deer antler headdress!

But to be honest, the equipment in the room is not worthy of the price. The online price is 700+, and the equipment in the guest room is no different from that of an ordinary hotel, and the curtain has such a big hole... And the quality of this gauze curtain seems really cheap. There is no closed wardrobe in the room, just a zippered hanging area... The sanitary dead corners are not handled well.
Giving this score has nothing to do with the service. The service is actually very good and considerate. The main reason is that I think the facilities are not worthy of the price

The decoration of the desert castle and the bathroom are small, but it's still enough. But the breakfast was good and rich. The hotel management is quite good. There was a service notice before arrival. There are self-service machines for check-in. The consultation was smooth. The service was very comfortable. The bed and pillows were comfortable.

msg:The hotel is in an excellent location. It is a landmark building on Haihua Island. It is large in scale and has more than 5,000 guest rooms. Therefore, the service details are lacking. For example, there is no boiling water room in the entire lobby. To drink hot water, you need a waiter in the dining hall, and the dining hall is not 24 hours a day. Open, the room decoration is old and impractical.

The butler's dedicated service is very good. Pick-up and drop-off is very convenient. Breakfast can be delivered to the room. There is also a self-service hotpot. No spa experience. The private soup is also good. The only thing is that the single room with an extra bed in the same bathroom is a little uncomfortable to sleep at night. Everything else is fine. It is still recommended to experience it.

msg:First of all, there are too few check-in counters in the hotel. There are many types of hotel check-in. There are several types of castles. Each hotel has its own office. The hotel check-in is overcrowded. Of course, the corresponding service will be slow and the luggage welcome at the door is basically self-service. Secondly, the hotel shuttle bus has no clear instructions. Directions depend on asking and guessing. With so many guests, there is basically no guarantee from the hotel where they can go for activities because the shuttle bus is not arranged at all. If you drive by yourself, it will be blocked and you will not be able to get close to the ocean park at the entrance of the park and hot springs. I only used one ticket and the Gokoku Hot Spring package. The only thing worthy of praise is that Ctrip’s backend service is really great. It worked hard to communicate with the hotel and Ocean Park, so that the problem was solved in time, and it was not in vain. The level of diamond membership is very good. Thank you Ctrip’s customer service for making your trip a good one.

This time during the Chinese New Year, I met my friends and family again at the Aubao Hotel on Haihua Island. Service Manager: Liu Xiaohu’s warm service warmed us up again. Last year It was also a coincidence that he came to receive us. This year he helped us upgrade our rooms in detail. Because we booked four rooms with children and elderly people, he gave thoughtful gifts to the children and sent us interesting activities on Haihua Island. Is it still possible? Say hello and see if you have any needs. Often you fall in love with a city because of a hotel, and a hotel feels comfortable and warm because of its enthusiastic service. I think Liu Xiaohu’s service is really good👍👍👍Conscience evaluation

The light show and children's playground that are said to be free are actually free. You can go to see them without the free gift. This is a bit tricky.

msg:My experience at the hotel the night before was very disturbing, so I complained to Ctrip. 7:20pm. We, an old couple, took a shower first and found that the bathroom sewer was blocked. Before we finished washing, there was already 2-3cm of water. I tried hard to open the sewer cover, but it didn't work, so I had to come out of the bathroom in embarrassment. Call room service immediately. A female waiter answered the phone with a cold attitude, indicating that the waiter was off work. It takes time to wait. 10 minutes later. A waiter came and brought 2 pairs of disposable slippers. We said that there was still so much water in the bathroom. We couldn't use the toilet or shower and the attendant left. Have called room service multiple times. At around 10 o'clock, a plumber with an ugly face came and used tools to pry open the bathroom drain cover before leaving. We told him that there was so much water under the sink beside the toilet outside the bathroom. The plumber was a little angry and said, "I'm not a waiter," so he left. So we made another 4-5 phone calls with customer service. At 10:20, a young waitress came and tried to clean the bathroom with a mop and dry towel, but there was too much water, so she went to remove the drain cover under the sink. What should I do? Will not work. We had to call customer service again. She actually didn't believe us and suggested that the waitress, whose hands and feet were all wet, go to the bedside of the guest room to answer the phone. After an exchange of local words between them that we didn't understand, the waitress left. It's getting later. Our couple, both in their 80s, suffer from severe high blood pressure and insomnia, and usually go to bed around 10 o'clock. I had to call customer service 5-6 more times, during which a male customer service representative said he would arrange it as soon as possible.
Fortunately, at nearly 10:50, the hotel front desk called our mobile phone and told us that the twin rooms on the 16th floor were all full, and asked if we agreed to move to a double room. We immediately agreed and offered to stay as close as possible to the original room. Because I have to move my luggage. The front desk said that the key card would be sent over as soon as possible. We expressed our opinions on the customer service's inattentiveness, disrespect for guests, and poor emergency response capabilities. The front desk apologized and left at 11 o'clock. We finished washing and it was already 11:40. We each took 2 pills of estazolam, but we still couldn't fall asleep and the quality of sleep was not good all night. We were too dizzy during the day yesterday and had no intention of visiting Haihua Island. It was a pity to end this trip.
We believe that such a thing would not happen even in a budget hotel or even a low-priced B&B, let alone a 5-diamond hotel. It took an hour and a half for the matter to be resolved, which is unbelievable! The matter has passed, and the purpose of writing this article is to prevent such things from happening again and allow guests to have a happy holiday in the hotel.

msg:The hotel's appearance and surrounding environment are grand and grand, but the details and comfort of the rooms have many flaws. There are more than 5,000 rooms and more than 5,000 pigeon cages. The decoration inside the room is very messy, especially the bathroom door and the shower room door are always touching each other, which is very inconvenient. The Five Kingdoms Hot Spring City has a decent exterior design and a lot of hot springs. However, the women's changing room and shower room felt very old, like a public bathroom with incomplete facilities and no comfort at all.
       The best thing 👍 is the beluga whale show in Ocean Park, wow! The exquisite performance of the four beluga whales and their trainer is amazing! There are also cute dolphins that are so cute that they make people laugh! The harmony and closeness between them and people make the audience feel affectionate and reluctant to leave! Big golden thumbs up👍👍👍

Hotel check-in basically requires self-service, otherwise there will be no queues. Surprise: Every day the hotel looks like a big car shop, with big cars and sedans constantly coming in, the lobby bustling with people, and the management is smooth. I admire it. The light show was not impressive. The must-visit attractions on the island are average. Both parks are suitable for children. The only place with good scenery for the elderly is Gokoku Hot Spring, but only those who have purchased a hot spring ticket can enter. Gokoku Hot Spring is extremely cost-effective. high. It is recommended that the elderly just take a small train ride around and take pictures. There is no need to see museums, performances, etc. Personal recommendations from five days on the island.

msg:A very good tourist reception hotel on the main island of Haihua Island No. 1, divided into ocean castle, forest castle, desert castle and glacier castle. My husband and I arrived late by car. In order to watch the light show at the Wedding Manor at night, we booked the hotel and stayed at Glacier Castle. At the self-service machine in the lobby, the staff patiently helped us check in. The room is very clean and tidy, and the style is what I like. As soon as you enter the room, the words "Welcome to the island owner xxx" and a warm reminder will be displayed on the TV screen. It makes people feel very warm and the experience is very good! The only regret is that there are few restaurants on the island. I thought that there was a Fengqing Street on the island with many restaurants, so I didn’t book breakfast in the hotel. It turned out that the Fengqing Street only opened at 10 in the morning and basically only opened for lunch. The first time visitors to the island should pay attention to this.

Fortunately, Ms. Tan Beauty at the front desk tried her best to coordinate and help me arrange a forest theme (with an upgraded sea view). We happened to sleep on the bunk beds and took the initiative to add WeChat in case there was any need later. As expected, there was no hot water in the room. A young lady, the housekeeper Wu Youzhi on WeChat, and the room attendant all actively helped me solve the problem.
Facilities: The hotel is large and stylish, and the parent-child room is comfortable and the children are happy. The dental appliances are thoughtfully divided into A and B so that they are not easily confused. But the children's toilet is broken and dirty. The windows in the room cannot be opened and the air is not very good. The breakfast is great, the restaurant environment is good, and the price/performance ratio is very good. It would be better if there are tableware for children.
The child is still unsatisfied and will come again in the future.

msg:A family trip to Haihua Island during the National Day is a wise choice. Although it was a hard journey to fly, train and then change to a bus, it was worth it the moment I checked into the Alburg Hotel. This is a dream castle, because with my 4-year-old Xiaobao and my 60-year-old mother, I chose the sea view parent-child suite. I did some research before booking and read the reviews from guests on Ctrip and other platforms. Most people were full of praise for the Auba Hotel. The negative reviews were mainly about the small rooms. The room we booked was a high-rise suite with one bedroom, one living room and two bathrooms (one shower room). You can watch the sunset from the living room and room windows, and there are two TVs. It's great, but the price is a little more expensive than an ordinary room. If you want to live comfortably, you need to budget more. The price of Aubao is much lower than that of hotels in Sanya at the same time. The price of the same class is almost 30-30% off. Compared with Hilton Haihua Island, Aubao’s most expensive Seaview Family Suite is not as expensive as Hilton’s most ordinary room, which is almost 300-300 yuan cheaper. 400 yuan. Now that we’ve talked about the price, let’s talk about the experience. Aubao is children's favorite. If possible, my children would like to live there forever. From Aubao to various attractions and food streets on Haihua Island, you can take the island-wide bus for free, you can also pay to take the small train and battery car, or rent a battery car. There are also free special buses from Aubao and the park that go directly to Wuguo Hot Spring City (currently only 3 pavilions are open), Children's World Ocean Park and Water World. There are so many interesting things to do in Haihua Island that you can’t finish them all in 3 days. Before I came here, I read that Haihua Island was not good. My feeling is that it is very fun and a good choice for vacation. You can travel freely and slowly. The twin beaches (the one at the Moon Tower is relatively clean, and the one at the Star Tower is a little noisy), hot springs, water park, and ocean park are all very good. I particularly like Ocean Park. I think it is a better experience than Zhuhai Chimelong. The park is beautiful, the animal performances are wonderful, and there are few key people. There are different queues to watch penguins and polar bears. The performance level of beluga whales is one of the best in the country. You can order takeout at the Auba Hotel, but it is inconvenient to buy medicine. There seems to be no pharmacy on the island, and it takes 1-3 days to deliver. Finally, let’s talk about the service. All the waiters I met were very polite and friendly, taking the initiative to say hello and greeting me with a smile. Before checking in, the housekeeper He Wen added my WeChat account and sent me the bus pick-up and drop-off time, the performances and activities of Haihua Island in the past few days, and the recommended attractions. After checking in, if you have any problems, you can contact the housekeeper as soon as possible, and they will be solved quickly. For example, the floor lamp in the living room does not light up. After reporting it to the housekeeper, waiters and engineers will soon come to repair it. The sanitation was also very clean. Breakfast is okay, but you get the bracelets after 12 noon every day. The bracelets from 8 to 9 o'clock are quickly finished. In the past few days, I have received the bracelets from 7 to 8 o'clock. I only went to the Manchester restaurant. If you have the chance to stay again, try out other restaurants, the hotel's swimming pool (children cannot swim this time because they have a cough) and the children's playground.

The hotel recommended by a friend said that if you have children, you must try its parent-child room. When we arrived on the island, we saw this hotel area from a distance. Since I arrived at the store in the evening, the lights were already on, making it grand and magnificent. It really reminded me of the MGM Hotel where I stayed in Las Vegas.

It is even more refreshing after entering the lobby, with tall shelves, romantic surrounding stairs, and sculptures surrounding the center.

Li Jingda, the receptionist at the front desk, was not only very handsome, but also very helpful in choosing the room with the best view, so he extended his stay in the next few days without hesitation!

The colors in the room are fresh and are indeed the children’s favorite combination. Although the room is small, we enjoyed the environment and facilities. After checking in and getting settled, I received a call from the hotel management and a thoughtful greeting from the front desk guy Li Jingda. What a great experience!

The only drawback is that the bathroom is too crowded! It’s a bit hard to turn around, and the aunt groups in October are coming one after another. Everyone chatted with loud voices, and they seemed to be unable to control themselves.

Overall, the price/performance ratio is still very high! Thanks for the hospitality!

msg:It's pretty good, especially the butler's service is very considerate. I received a call shortly after checking in to ask if I had any questions, and added WeChat to help solve any problems at any time. My housekeeper's name is He Jun. I told him that my foot was scratched, and he immediately arranged for someone to deliver iodine and a band-aid. He also responded to all other questions. The butler service is very useful for first-time tourists. The seafood buffet at Hotel 129 is also affordable. Although the room is not big, it is clean and tidy. All the service staff have a good attitude. It can be seen that they love this job. I sincerely hope that the Aubao Hotel will not be influenced by Xu Jiayin and continue to operate like this

The light blue color is very comfortable. The hotel is clean and tidy, and the staff are very enthusiastic! After the game, we booked a double room with a sea view. This time we stayed in a forest-themed room. When we got out of the elevator, wow, I like the green color, it’s so comfortable. The room is decorated cutely, with a small table for koalas, a bedside table with feet, and even the kettle and cups are green, children like it very much!

This time I stayed at the Alburg Hotel and it felt very convenient. There is a small swimming pool downstairs, as well as many small shops and restaurants. You can reach entertainment places by taking a shuttle bus. Stayed for 3 days and 2 nights and had a great time! The only oversight was not buying a package ticket. If you buy the accommodation, water world, and aquarium, it will be a lot more cost-effective. It was very busy this time, but it did not affect my mood at all. Overall, I am very satisfied! In particular, the hotel's butler Huang Dong responded to messages in a timely manner and solved problems well.

We arrived at the hotel to check in at 8:30 that morning. The front desk forgot to tell us that there were fireworks tickets in the room. At 9:30, the front desk called us and told us that there was no time to return to the hotel to get the fireworks tickets, and told us to go to the fireworks shop to collect the tickets. The Gatling card failed to tell us that the time for collecting fireworks is from 18:00 to 22:00. We went to collect the fireworks at 22:03, but the attitude of the fireworks shop was very bad! We called the hotel staff to report the situation, and the staff gave me two replacement tickets the next day, saying that I could pick them up between 18:00 and 22:00. The next day we went to the fireworks shop to pick up the rolls. The fireworks shop said they were not sure whether my rolls were picked up from the ground... Oh my God, where did I pick them up from the ground? So funny! This kind of fireworks shop can be cooperated with both hotels and hotels! have a bad attitude! ! ! Poor hotel hygiene

msg:I really want to thank the housekeeper Zou Shuai this time. In the early stage, my little brother gave me various guides on Haihua Island regarding food, accommodation and transportation. Since it was my first time to come to Danzhou and I was bringing children, I had all kinds of worries. My little brother Zou Shuai's careful strategy helped me dispel my worries. Later, because I booked a parent-child room for two days, and because the children wanted to experience more of their different parent-child rooms, it would involve a room change. Brother He also helped us book a room in advance, and the next day he personally came to my room to help me carry my luggage and change rooms. After changing rooms, I found that my child's tablet was left in the front room. I didn't notice it yet, but my brother found it before me and helped me. I'll send it to the back room. To be honest, the hardware of the Aubao Hotel is not the best, and the toiletries inside are not of big brands, but for the butler Zou Shuai, this hotel is worth it. Really, I have stayed in many places all over the world. In many hotels and B&Bs, Mr. Zou Shuai from Oubao really makes me feel warm and considerate. Sometimes the humanistic care is warmer than hotel facilities and is more worthy of everyone's aftertaste. As for Zou Shuai, the housekeeper of Aubao Hotel, I will recommend Aubao Hotel to my relatives and friends. It was a super satisfying stay.

msg:Check-in was on September 29th. There were not many people. It took five minutes to check in under the guidance of the staff, and we chose the forest theme that our children wanted. I paid the price difference and upgraded to a sea view parent-child suite. I was very satisfied with the room facilities and cleanliness. The children were very happy. The accommodation environment can be regarded as a tourist attraction, which brings a good mood. The suite comes with Gatling fireworks set off at Twin Beach every night, which is an unexpected surprise. The semi-buffet pasta included in the hotel package is very child-friendly, and there is more food for children to eat. Among all the public transportation lines around the island, only the small train goes to Guanhai Square. It’s a bit sunny during the day, but the scenery is pretty good.
It's the Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day, so it's crowded and lively. The Botanical Garden light show in the evening (fireworks at nine o'clock) is worth seeing. The light show at the Wedding Manor is better than the Hilton Twin Towers.
The biggest drawback is the breakfast. The 9.30 breakfast is from 9 to 10 o'clock. Although there are many people, the food is rich. The 10.1 breakfast is from 10 to 11 o'clock, but the result is basically leftovers.

Facilities: When you first enter the room, you can see the welcome message on the TV, which is quite ceremonial. The bathroom has a retractable clothesline, which is very practical.
Environment: In the off-season, it is on the island, quiet and comfortable. Every scenic spot on the island is very close, you can walk, or you can take the No. 1 round-the-island bus to wander around, which is very comfortable. The Sheng Kee Restaurant in the island’s food street tastes pretty good, recommended~

There are a lot of people in the hotel, but there are very few people in other parts of Haihua Island. I don’t know where the people on the island have gone.
The occupancy rate is so high during the summer vacation, and the hotel even opened a swimming pool, which is overcrowded. Although the breakfast is good, it can only be eaten according to the time of day, which is really uncomfortable
For everything on Haihua Island, there is no charge for tickets. The hotel itself can basically say nothing...

msg:On Haihua Island No. 1, if you have a hotel reservation, you can drive your car to the hotel's underground garage. The housekeeper Ren Jun was contacted in advance before arrival. If you have any questions during your stay, it is very convenient to ask the housekeeper directly. There are a lot of people in the hotel during the summer vacation. Breakfast is divided into time periods. You will be given a bracelet according to the time period and will take it back when eating breakfast. There are a lot of people coming in according to the time period, so you have to rely on your quick eyes and quick hands to get a seat, and the waiters are too busy collecting the tableware to care. The overall feeling is that there are many people but it is still orderly and most people are of good quality. Not far from the island, we also went to the thousand-year-old salt field, where any salt-baked chicken is delicious.

The butler service is very convenient. When we moved from the Alburg Hotel to the villa, the experience improved a lot. If you need anything, just say it in the butler group, and someone will respond quickly. There are cars to pick you up wherever you want to go, which is very convenient. Thank you again to the butler team Qiu Yingyuan, Zhang Guangjian, and Fu Wangwei. The service is very good. Actually, come in winter It is probably better. Even if it is so hot now, the children still have to soak in the hot spring in the yard every day. Whether it is hardware or services, I think this two-bedroom villa is really cost-effective.

The housekeeper Ren Jun also called in advance on the day of check-in to confirm. The service is very friendly , After arriving in the room, the small bed with slides made the cubs very excited. You can also see the sea view by the window, and the night view is also beautiful. There are children's paddling pool and swimming pool downstairs, and I can't wait to experience it as soon as I check in. There are also many scenic spots on the island that can be checked in, and the transportation is convenient. You can take a bus at the door of the hotel, and you can go shopping and catering. I am quite satisfied.

msg:The overall design of Haihua Island is good, but it is a pity that there is not enough passenger flow. Only the hotel seems to be crowded, and it is not very popular if it is scattered in scenic spots. There are few paintings displayed in the museum, many venues in Ocean Paradise are not open, and there are few types of marine animals. Only the beluga show is okay; there are not many people in the hot spring city, and the experience is average. I didn’t tell you that there are more mosquitoes. Is there any mosquito repellent water provided? Yes, there are fewer service staff.
The location of the hotel is easy to find, and the parking space is tight. Although the breakfast is divided, we still have to grab a seat.
Room: I stayed in a parent-child sea view room and a parent-child room. There is no difference in the room type, and I have repeatedly told the front desk not to arrange a corner room. Both times it is a corner room. The area is not large, and it is even more narrow. Is the pre-sale package only available? Match the corner 😓
Service: As soon as we arrived at the entrance of the hotel, because my husband was going to park the car, my child and I prepared to go in with our big suitcases. We signaled the staff at the entrance to help us, but no one paid attention to us, and our expressions were indifferent. It was such a hot day It makes people feel a coolness! 😓Maybe ordinary hotels will be eager to help! When you check in, if you don’t ask, you won’t take the initiative to tell how to use the content in the package. You may be tired of explaining, but not all guests come to play for the Nth time, right? How do we know? Just keep urging to hurry up. During the play, I asked in advance whether Ocean Paradise had a night show, and the answer was yes, so I deliberately entered later. At around 18:00, the staff inside informed that the night show had been canceled for a long time🤣. 2 points are given to the manager at the front desk, and there were two small problems that were quickly resolved.
Hygiene: The room looks clean and tidy. Why is the hygiene bad? ⚠️The hotel’s noodle shop, the package includes it, so I went to experience it. It’s not cheap to buy it at the original price. Fortunately, my family didn’t eat Roujiamo, and I had diarrhea several times that night. Fortunately, I had prepared gastrointestinal medicine. Many stores on the island are not open, so shopping is not very convenient.
The small train included needs to walk a few hundred meters from the hotel, and sometimes it takes a long time to wait. I don’t know what the hotel’s own shuttle bus is used for? Or what kind of guests can ride!

In short, I hope that the service and sanitation can match the price!

msg:If you have to walk to the island for a long time, you have to wait for the bus in Haihua Island to go anywhere. If you can't wait, you can take the cable car for 20 yuan per person, and you can only choose one place. In the afternoon, we went to the water park to play and queue up to buy food. When it was time to place our order, a customer jumped in line. The staff turned a blind eye and let others cut in line to order! Later, I asked the staff if I was waiting in line to buy something and could I jump in line? The staff completely ignored me! ! ! The service is really bad. The next morning when I was wandering around the island, there was a sudden heavy rain. I took shelter in the toilet. However, after waiting for half an hour after the rain started, I still couldn't go back. There was no bus passing by diagonally opposite. I saw a cable car passing by and stopped it. I asked the staff to just watch. He took one look and drove away. After waiting for another half hour and it was still raining, we had no choice but to ask the staff next to the toilet if we could contact the hotel to ask the cable car to come and take us back to the room. Later, we called and said that it was raining and we couldn't come, so we had to find a way to wait until the rain stopped. The point is that I passed many cable cars on the way and even if I called the staff, they still ignored me. After waiting for an hour and a half, I still couldn't get back to the hotel. Finally, after waiting for so long, the children became impatient. When they saw tourists passing by, they had to ask passers-by to borrow umbrellas and walked for a long time back to the hotel and drove their own cars to pick up the children. It took more than 2 hours to get back to the room! The service is extremely poor! ! ! There is no staff to solve the problem at all. The living environment and fun are OK, but the service attitude is so bad! ! ! If there is any problem, no staff can solve it! ! ! I rarely comment, but the service at Haihua Island was really disappointing! ! ! As a tourist city in Hainan, this kind of service really needs to be reviewed! ! ! ! ! !

The light show is included, but it only lasts a few minutes and I couldn’t catch up. I guess everyone who came here said it was a trap!

The safe in the changed room was broken, and the hair dryer also had problems, so I didn't want to bother to inform the front desk. The front desk staff of the hotel asked WeChat to follow and become a member. But I always feel that it is more expensive than Ctrip to buy hot springs and other entertainment. But fortunately, four breakfasts were refunded in the end. The hotel buffet was good on the first day, but it was really bad on the second day, it was so unpalatable. Remind friends who go in July, the water park is good and worth playing, and the botanical garden is also good, but the hot springs are not recommended, and two parks are not open. I went there at night, it was dark, not bright, some people are afraid of insects, and the water temperature is not good, it feels like a swimming pool in Xiaotong, and others are even more speechless.
However, the scenery of the island is still very charming, it is worth visiting and seeing, after all, there are many places for entertainment. There are many check-in points.
The room is not big, and the beds are too close, but it is worth visiting Haihua Island in the off-season. In the water world, you need to bring your own towels and bathing supplies, and store clothes for 30 yuan.
There are many go-out foods on the island, Naixue, coco, Taier pickled fish, KFC, McDonald's, etc.
The hotel has a circular bus every 15 minutes, to attractions, entertainment and other places, convenient
There is also a small train for 45 yuan a day to visit Island No. 1
still worth visiting

First of all, before check-in, Liu Xiaohu, the lobby manager of the hotel, contacted me in advance and told me some things I might encounter (how to park, whether I need to pick up the airport, etc.), and upgraded me to a sea-view room. I really feel very warm .
In addition, the 2km around the hotel are tourist attractions. The hotel offers a free unlimited sightseeing train (priced at 45 yuan/person/day), and took the children to the water park (the treasure park provided by the package, there are not many people, no need Queue, take children or couples to play with perfect experience, there are so many projects, the appearance is snow-capped mountains, it feels bigger than Atlantis, Atlantis waits for two hours for one project, and plays for one minute), Gemini Beach, just a short distance away In terms of convenience, I have to say that Aubao is definitely the first choice for travel and accommodation.
The staff in the lobby are also very responsible. They can answer all the questions. There are many people who check in, and they all deal with them in an orderly manner.
The essential! This hotel is too big. It is a castle-themed hotel. Our children really love it. There is a swimming pool on the first floor, and we brought our children there to play. The safety facilities are very good, and there are many staff members, who will take the initiative to say hello to the children.
There are many types of buffet breakfast, it ends at 10 o'clock, sleeps until 9:30 o'clock, brunch is settled together, and we are full. At exactly 10 o'clock, all the amu*****t projects have opened, and we can go to play again.
Thank you for meeting such a treasure hotel

msg:This is the second time I have come to Aubao Hotel in Haihua Island. My baby likes Haihua Island very much. It combines food, drink and entertainment. Immediately booked a room for 2 nights on Ctrip, I am four children and two children, rushing before the summer vacation! Entering the lobby of the Alborg Hotel, a five-star experience, the main body of the Alborg Hotel is divided into four series, glaciers, oceans, forests, and deserts. Because it is not yet summer, only glaciers are open, which is too much for me, haha. The little girl Zhu Meifen at the front desk received her. She spoke softly and was also very enthusiastic. Plus 🍗, she even upgraded the room for us, with a super invincible sea view. The room has large floor-to-ceiling windows. The view is beautiful. You can lie on the bed and enjoy the sea view. super happy. The room has a big bed and a small bed. The shape of a small train, the baby likes it, and the bathroom is quite satisfactory. I think the price is really satisfactory. There are shuttle buses to go to Wuguo Hot Spring, Ocean Paradise, and Water World when staying at the Aubao Hotel, every half an hour. Very convenient. The breakfast buffet is on the first floor, with a complete range of items. Of course, I love Ding'an powder. I like it. For lunch, I ate noodles, meat buns, and beef noodles. In the lobby on the first floor, there are supermarkets, colorful fruit, restaurants, gift shops, etc. The prices are very reasonable. The popularity of Haihua Island in July is really acceptable, and other staff are also waving enthusiastically. I look forward to coming back next year, hee hee.

First of all, the decoration of the hotel is magnificent and luxurious, giving people the feeling of entering a theme park. Secondly, the room size is moderate, the facilities are good, and the decoration style is warm and childlike. We stayed at Glacier Castle twice, and the overall feeling is good. Finally, the hotel is the starting point of the Haihua Island Line 1 bus, and it is more convenient to go to various theme parks.
The downside is that due to the large number of teams staying in the hotel, the lobby on the first floor is quite noisy.

msg:Overall, I am satisfied with the room. There were no mosquito bites during this stay. The front desk service was poor, and the waitress who announced the train during my stay at the hotel including the train was poor! The complaint has been unsuccessful so far. At 19:55 on the evening of the 27th, the family went to the train to have dinner together. When they got to the train, they were about to get on the train. The Boeing waitress stood at the intersection without giving instructions and looked at the customer squinting up and down with an extremely attitude. Worse, talking is even more disgusting? Ask her why she looks at customers like a thief, and if you have anything to say, just say it! The waitress said that you don’t look like people who don’t know how to scan QR codes, and you have a big belly. I said whoever has a big belly is pregnant! Blind Huba said! Customers who want to stay in the hotel can scan the QR code and express it clearly with a correct attitude, instead of being a thief and saying that they have a bad attitude, poor expression, poor language structure, poor EQ and no IQ! The service staff is responsible for telling customers what they need to scan codes or pay, instead of talking like this in a weird way! ! ! The customer is not the service staff? How do you know what code to show her? No response to the complaint yet? That night when I returned to the hotel from the restaurant street, there was no car and I had to wait for a long time with my children. I checked Ctrip and gave the front desk phone number. I heard that the front desk staff will have a small train for a long time. Does the driver of the small train have a phone number? It is too hard to take care of the children on the roadside in the middle of the night. The front desk is not I don’t know a word to pay attention to! no phone! Complaints about these two things in general!

After patiently communicating with the manager, she helped upgrade to the supreme parent-child room with sea view for free. Our child and wife have Hong Kong ID cards, and she also handled it patiently , take a good photo of the ID, and let us take the child into the room in advance. It is such a blessing to meet a good front desk when you are physically and mentally exhausted. Haihua Island is very big, and the Opel Hotel has very few parking spaces. Those who drive here on holidays have no underground parking spaces, so they can only park at the conference center. The hotel's breakfast is ok, there are 4-5 booths with different food flavors. The overall feeling is that I want to stay again, but it's not a holiday.

It is hard to imagine how uncomfortable it is to go out when it is full of people in the peak season . It is suitable for family trips, especially those who plan to only play in Haihua Island, or families with self-driving cars. Otherwise, even if they go to Fengfeng Street or even go to the next building, the distance will be too far to make people excited.

The hotel is a parent-child hotel, suitable for staying and playing with children, and the price is very high. There is a free shuttle bus that stops around the island, which is very convenient.
The Haihua Island light show is more distinctive, but it is not yet shocking. Compared with several major projects of Evergrande, Haihua Island is worth spending two to three days to have fun.

Generally speaking, the location of the hotel is very good, but the price is also high. Some feel that the price is not right. There are very few people staying in the four theme room types, and now only two are opened, which is basically dissatisfied.
Because I prefer larger rooms, I booked the Supreme Sea View Suite with my children. Stay in room 16, the room is very soundproof, the sea view is average, it is not the ultimate, it is recommended that you choose Glacier Castle No. 1, No. 2, No. 45, No. 46 sea view is better.
It is recommended that the merchant lower the price, and the current price is not much different from Hilton.
Haihua Island Lighting Show: The first show is at 20:00. Second game 21:30

msg:A total of two rooms were photographed, a twin room and a parent-child suite, which add up to 1690. The twin room is for the elderly, and the parent-child suite is for oneself, so the following reviews are only for the parent-child suite.
1. Service: There are a lot of people on May 1st, but it is indeed the first time that I can check in at 15:00 and have to wait for the room. Yes, that’s right, check-in at 15 o’clock, but you can’t get into the room right away, you have to wait, when will you wait? haha, I do not know. Then you have to check out before 12 o'clock the next day. The lobby is full of people waiting for a room with suitcases. I also encountered that I went directly to the room to check in while cleaning, and then came down to apply for the room card. It can be seen how chaotic the hotel management is. If you don't have the reception capacity, you don't need to sell so many houses. Also, if you are in a hurry, you can find the on-site supervisor and allocate a room. If you don’t look for it yourself, you can just wait. It’s really amazing. It was originally planned to give one star, but the hotel customer service contacted me with a very good attitude, so two stars.
2. Hygiene: The hotel with nearly 1,000 a night is unique. As soon as I entered the room, I saw three cockroaches on the floor, and there were mosquitoes on the bed and bedside table. My hands were covered with dust, and the walls were still peeling off. This hotel is so expensive, and it only gets the credit of being on the No. 1 island. In fact, it is nothing. When I went to the toilet at night, I found a big cockroach, alive. A friend of mine also lives here and killed two cockroaches. The sanitation is really bad.
3. Facilities and environment: Located on No. 1 Island, it is convenient. The facilities are very complete.
4. Highlights: The hotel's breakfast buffet is okay.
Comments: Not worth it, very not worth it. It is recommended to go to Haihua Island by car, and then live on Island No. 2. It doesn’t take long to drive to and from Island No. 1 and No. 2. The accommodation on Island No. 1 is only 2,300. Quite not worth it!

The various scenic spots of Haihua Island are very attractive and the scenery is beautiful. It is also a place where children like to go. The few days I spent in Haihua Island were very happy.

msg:When I checked in for the first time, I always felt that the hotel staff greeted us warmly. From the successful booking to the departure from the hotel, I felt the hotel's high-quality service. I stayed in the hotel temporarily at night and bought a package ticket. Just after the performance, I received a call from the hotel manager Liu Xiaohu, asking where we were and how to check in at the hotel quickly. After checking in, we arranged for a car to take us to the parking lot to pick up our luggage. After a while, I received a guide to Haihua Island from Manager Liu. We were very pleasantly surprised when we got to the room. We were very satisfied with the location of the room arranged by the hotel. You can see the beautiful sea view. In addition, the hotel is very considerate and gave you an anti-mosquito wristband. Although we were traveling as two people, the hotel room also prepared a cute toothbrush for children And children's shampoo and body wash, very attentive. The breakfast is very rich, with a variety of varieties, and the taste is superb. The hotel pool is also very clean. I spent the whole morning sightseeing and browsing museums and shopping malls by taking the small train. I went to Wuguo Hot Spring to soak in the hot springs for an afternoon at 3:00 pm. It was so comfortable. I had planned to spend a day here for two days. I will stay here again next time. Hope the hotel is getting better and better

It's just that the buffet in the hotel needs to be improved! The price can be slightly adjusted, but the quality and variety of the dishes must be guaranteed. Maybe our meal time is a little late, around 8:00 p.m. Knife fish, a few shellfish, frozen 🦐, 🦀️ are gone, I asked the waiter, if you can add a plate for me, we will use it in the store, but I was told that they are all gone, there are 5 of us, and I don’t feel like asking High 😂) In desperation, I can only call TAXI to eat at the food street again, because after going to the island, there are few places to eat, so I can only go to the food street. If you have enough time, you can wait for line 1, and the round trip to the hotel is not bad convenient!
Facilities: Disposable slippers are not provided
Hygiene: very clean and tidy
Environment: good, choose the forest castle
Service: No one answered the phone at the front desk
Hotel Children's Paradise: There are more items for adults to play, but almost all of them open after 12:00 or 1:00 pm, which may be due to the lack of people
Exclusive parking at Aubao Hotel: When there is a parking space, you can park directly in the underground parking lot, which is more convenient

msg:There is no partition between the two beds in the twin room and they can be pushed together directly, making it suitable for children.

The room is not big, but it is well-equipped and the hygiene is good.
The breakfast is rich and can satisfy both the elderly and children.

What is different from the past is that you can now drive your car directly to the hotel ba*****t, which greatly improves the stay experience.

Special praise should be given to the young and handsome shuttle bus driver "Li Jingda". When we learned that our information was still stuck on parking the car in the central parking lot, they proactively told us that we could park the car underground in the hotel and were willing to take us back to pick up the car immediately. When we said we would pick up the car the next day when we left the island, we took the initiative to leave our contact information and said that we could contact him directly to implement the pick-up service when we left the island.

This proactive service spirit and attitude is not only the highlight of the Aubao Hotel and Haihua Island, but also one of the most impressive labels of the entire Hainan Free Trade Port.

Hygiene: There is a bathroom smell after entering the room. The first impression is very bad. The bedding is in very average condition and is relatively humid.
Service: There are more than 5,000 guest rooms in total. During the National Day holiday, the passenger flow is very heavy. No matter whether the in-room phone calls are made to the general affairs, the front desk or the guest rooms, no one can get through.
Environment: The overall environment of the hotel is good, but the rooms are really not ideal.
Finally, I personally don’t recommend staying here. If you plan to spend a few days in Haihua Island and want to stay in a hotel, it’s better to stay at the Hilton.

If the whole scenic spot is really big on foot, you need a shuttle bus, and there are also small trains that cost money.

msg:The room is small and the windows cannot be opened. This season, the grandparents and aunts are out, and it is too noisy in the morning. There are a lot of people eating breakfast, so it is necessary to share meals. Dinner is more expensive, one is more than 200 and the other is nearly 100. Fortunately, there are not many people. As long as you leave the hotel and do not leave the island, there are free buses. The hotel staff are very polite, everyone will greet you, and when the child is older, bring him to open his eyes once.

No one was cleaning in the middle of the night. The next day when I wanted to renew my room, the front desk told me to place the order directly. I asked again at noon and said there was no room available. I went to the front desk in the evening to confirm that it was available again. Throughout the whole process, the front desk staff, including the waiter who answered the phone, acted as if they didn't understand people, and they didn't know how to apologize if they made mistakes.

The housekeeper said that it was not necessary and just put the room card in the room. They checked the room. Ten minutes after we left, they reported that a tea cup lid was broken. You confirmed with me and I said there was no damage. The housekeeper said that their waiters have basic literacy. I am very surprised. Do you mean that our guests do not have basic literacy? Are you confirming that with me? You were telling me that if it breaks, you have to pay for it! Will we not tell you if our guests damage it? What is basic literacy? Is this attitude your quality?

The legs of the double bed can be stretched out so that they can go to the other bed. There is only a noodle buffet for dinner. I decided to come here on the spur of the moment. It feels worse than the one in Haikou. The hotel has a smell in the corridor, and it feels a bit like a bath center. Parking is inconvenient. The waiter in the lobby said that you can park downstairs. When you get to the entrance of the underground parking lot, you are not allowed to enter. You have to park on the ground. After parking, you have to walk a long way back to the hotel. There is no shuttle bus, the breakfast is okay, but you need to eat at different times. How can I put it, there is no life of a five-star hotel, but there is a disease of a five-star hotel.

From check-in, to the guest room, to the outing, the service staff are very enthusiastic, this is a commendation. Let me complain a bit, the entrance to the lobby was too blocked when checking out. It’s understandable that there are so many people and there’s a traffic jam. But the problem is that it’s so blocked that there’s a row of paid shuttle buses at the entrance (all empty). I don’t understand? Can't you wait for less customers? Or if there are fewer shuttle buses parked appropriately, is this competing for time with customers?

You have to wait for his minibus to get in and out of the island. The hotel looks good from the outside, but the room is very poor: the room is small, the bathroom is cramped, there are no cotton slippers, and the bedding quality is average (the experience of staying in a small hotel). Breakfast is average. You have to go to the front desk 10,000 yuan in advance to get a breakfast bracelet. If you forget to take it, you won't have to eat it. Registration at the front desk was slow and there was a long queue. There are no beaches on the island, just a little bit. Visiting this island is similar to visiting a villa community. Those who want to play in the sea may be disappointed.

msg:The hotel room is very small, much smaller than the smallest express hotel I have ever stayed in. After opening the suitcase, there is no room to put your feet in the room. The table is a narrow ***** against the wall, directly under the TV. If you put something on the table, it will block the TV. It is so small. The bathroom is also very small. My son had a bowel movement and the stench in the room lingered for a long time. The air conditioner made a lot of noise. It was too hot when it was turned off and too noisy when it was turned on. The so-called sea view is a thin ***** of water between the two buildings in the distance. It's hard to imagine this is a resort hotel. Do you come here from all over the world to experience the humble life?

When I got to the room, I felt like I was in jail, not on vacation, so I offered to pay to upgrade the room. As a result, I called countless times, but I couldn't upgrade. They said that because we were a conference party, we could only book the room through the conference party. Are you planning to join forces with the conference parties to deceive me? As a result, I went to find the conference organizer, who was busy with meeting registration. It was like this for a long time, and in the end, after two hours of fussing, I was told that I could upgrade. After checking, I found that there was no room. I kept asking them, I paid for the room I booked and upgraded myself, why do I need someone else to agree. Who exactly are your customers? Just because the conference organizer is your major client, can you ignore my needs?

Now let’s talk about service. As soon as I entered the room, I saw hair left by my predecessor on the bathroom wall. Daily cleaning will never be clean, it will always leave us with some memories of yesterday.

All in all, I won’t go there again, and I hope everyone will be careful not to be deceived, and not to suffer.

The hotel immediately arranged for medical staff to come to the room to inquire about the situation. At the same time, it arranged for an ambulance to go to Yangpu Hospital for trea**ent, and went to the hospital for relevant examinations to confirm that there was no serious problem. Return to hotel after blood pressure drops. The next day, the hotel staff and doctors called in succession to inquire about the recovery and put forward suggestions and precautions. So thanks again to the hotel staff and doctors! If you plan to stay for a few more days, enjoy the facilities and services of Haihua Island and the hotel. But due to my wife's high blood pressure and hot weather, I regret to end this trip. Come back next time! Although the stay is short, we can also feel that the service and management level of the hotel is professional, high-quality, serious, enthusiastic and considerate. It fully reflects the sincere service of people-oriented and guest-oriented. I wish the hotel business is booming!

🚗 Transportation: It is best to drive by yourself, otherwise it is really not very convenient. There is a train station shuttle bus, but I have not experienced it. There are free buses on the island, but they don't stop at the beck and call. They have to stop and run very far, which is particularly inhumane. The starting price is 30 yuan, and each person exceeds 10 yuan. You only go to one point, stop and charge again, which is very expensive!

msg:Stayed for the second time this year. The double room I stayed in this time felt more spacious than the twin room I stayed in last time. This time the hotel had fewer guests, the underground parking lot was empty, and the room was upgraded to a massive room thanks to the front desk. The hotel rooms are clean and comfortable, and welcome fruits are provided. The staff are still excellent as always. It&#39;s just that this season is stuffy and hot, and I feel uncomfortable, not as comfortable as in February. In fact, Haihua Island is very worth tasting slowly, playing well, living well, eating a lot and not expensive, and the shopping environment is also very good. Next time I plan to stay in the cool season for 10 days and 8 days.

msg:I don't know where the praise came from. It's just a pit. Only the glacier theme can live in the four themes, and most of the facilities on the island are closed.
1. I didn’t see how the light show was, it didn’t match the propaganda at all, maybe it was too sluggish and the electricity bill could not afford it. It was just the light scene of an ordinary building without spotlights.
2. Ocean Paradise is even more ridiculous. I only saw beluga whales and a bunch of penguins. The polar bear said that he had a physical examination, but it was actually locked in a cage and not to the outside world. In the gap outside, I saw a bear that was neither white nor impatient to go back and forth in the house. It's really pitiful that these boreal animals are caught in the tropics. The walrus said that during training, a few sea lions will be placed in the pool to recharge! The venue is very large, and only the few species of animals are sp****. Beluga penguin sea lion! A hot summer day.
3. The water park, the water park that children are thinking about, is the most unsuccessful project in this trip. It is open from 11:00 to 6:00 in the afternoon! Most of the projects are still closed, and some say that they will open at one o'clock in the afternoon, due to the climate of the west line of Hainan. From 11:00 am to 6:00 pm, it is almost non-breathing sun exposure, except when it is cloudy and rainy! All the facilities are under the scorching sun, and the ground is hot and easy to burn. It's really ants on a hot pot. There are very few projects that three or four-year-olds can play, including two swimming pools under the scorching sun and a set of small slides. It is simply a crime to spend money.
4. It takes about ten minutes to walk from the water park and the aquarium to the bus station. That section of the road is a nightmare, hot, and exposed to the sun. However, there are battery cars at the entrance of the two venues. It is not free. The price for four people is 60! The time for the test has come. If you can bear it and feel bad about money, you can walk. If you are afraid that your child will suffer from heat stroke, you will choose to take a car. There are still options. Very human.
5. Catering, they all say how good the breakfast buffet is. I am looking forward to it. In fact, it is quite satisfactory. It is a very ordinary buffet breakfast, noodles, porridge, bread and simple milk. . . . . Very ordinary, not so good. I can go to the commercial street for dinner at noon and evening. I feel sorry for the merchants. There are not many customers in the entire dining area, and many houses do not have a single customer. ** I chose the one with the highest score, only our table, the waiter is not happy, it may be our arrival. disturb their tranquility! Seventy or eighty per capita can eat enough, but that is enough to eat. What else can you expect from restaurants in the scenic area? It is said that there is a shop that is very famous for its stinky tofu, and it even packs two servings, 30 yuan and 10 pieces, which are salty and bitter. I ate a piece and threw it away. Most of the shops are closed at night, and those quiet alleys can be wandered around.
6. There are disadvantages and advantages. Humanized management. The bus loop on the island is free, and the main station can get on and off. There is air conditioning, and the small train is at your own expense.
7. There are very few guests on the island, there is no need to queue up for anything, and there are also ** delivery. There is a bottle of Coke in the self-service machine for ten yuan. Although it is a bit expensive, there are many counters. You can buy it at any time to quench your thirst. There is also a small supermarket in Lawson, where you can shop very cheaply.
8. The Oubao Hotel has a butler WeChat to provide consulting services. When entering the island for the first time, it is inevitable to be blinded. It is very convenient for someone to consult at any time!
9. Hotel guests who forget to take the parking ticket can show the order for free parking fee, otherwise the parking fee of 70 per night will be a pain in the flesh!

I came here from a local, and when I met a foreigner who came to play here, I would criticize it as bad or bad. To be honest, the quality is really not very good, and the tolerance is very poor. There may be some places in such a big hotel that it is not good enough, but it is not enough to incite a group of people there. I really hate this kind of people and affect my mood.

msg:This was a wonderful trip. We were a family of five and two elderly people. I brought two five-year-old children. On Ctrip, I booked the Oubao Hotel on Haihua Island. We also booked the Wuguo Hot Spring and the Children’s Ocean Paradise together. . On the day I went there, the housekeeper of the Aubao Hotel (lobby manager kelvin shi) called me, added WeChat, and asked about the needs. We booked two standard rooms for two days, knowing that we brought two children, When we arrived, we were upgraded to a parent-child room with sea view. Thank you very much. The experience was very good. The child wetted the bed at night, and the quilt, bed and sheets were all wet. I was embarrassed. Replaced everything, really appreciate it. Everyone who enters the hotel is very enthusiastic, and they will take the initiative to say hello to you, and they will also chat with the children, which is very warm. In the evening, I sat on Line 1 to watch the light show Jadeite, which was very beautiful. There was a commercial street and various theme parks on No. 1, and the children had a great time. We went to have breakfast the next morning, it was very rich, and the time period was optional. The time difference in Xinjiang was two hours, so we chose the time period of 9-10 o'clock, and we didn't rush. After eating, I took the shuttle bus and went to Ocean Paradise to have cute pet performances, seals, beluga whale performances, etc. The children were very happy. I went to Wuguo Hot Spring at 5 o'clock in the afternoon. There are Japanese, Thai, children's pool, Italian and other styles. I didn't come back until 10 o'clock in the evening. Before leaving on the third day, the adults swam in the swimming pool of the Aubao Hotel, and the children swam in the children's pool. I had a lot of fun, I was about to leave the hotel, and I felt like I didn’t have enough. We go to Sanya every year, and it feels different from the experience here. There are many places to play in Haihua Island, and the price is not high. It is especially suitable for bringing the elderly and children to a slow life. I haven't been to 2 islands and 3 islands yet, and I will choose here next time.

msg:🧩The second time I came to Haihua Island, it was a pity that I didn’t stay at the Oubao Hotel in a hurry for the first time, so I started the official trip to Haihua Island on this May Day. Due to the epidemic, the entertainment venues could not all be opened. Again ➕ The heavy rains on the whole island of Hainan seem to indicate in advance that our trip will be unpleasant, but this is not the case, let me tell you:
        After staying at the Aubao Hotel this time, the most intuitive feeling is that you must stay at the Aubao Hotel when you come to Haihua Island to play! ! ! First of all, the first point is the free pick-up service provided by Aubao Hotel at the Baimajing High-speed Railway Station Visitor Center. It runs between the high-speed railway station and the hotel on time every day, allowing you to enjoy the only passable bus on the island that goes directly to the downstairs of the hotel. ;Second: Living here, you can not only spend a little 💰 to experience the same star hotel as Hilton, but you can also take 🚗 to various bus lines on the island right out of the hotel. You want to walk in along the bridge from outside the island. The first trip may be fresh, but how many times do you go? Do you want to drag your tired body when you are very tired from playing and watch others take a car to the hotel to rest? Do you want to experience that it is difficult to find a business to solve the problem after you stay in the homestay? If you don't want to, choose Oubao for sure! !
🍃Environment➕🧹Hygiene: From the outside, the Aubao Hotel will make you feel like you are in Macau, and it is very advanced. Whether it's from the passages outside the hotel, the fountains, or all the corners of the hotel, it's exceptionally clean, you'll be surprised for a while, because it's really wow! Every place in the hotel is very clean, giving you a feeling of peace of mind. Maybe when you are still worried about the risk of low prices, the clean environment will also make you feel relieved and bold.

🔔Service: Service is a part of what I want to focus on. It may be that the hotel I stayed in before was not so high-end, or it may be that the hotel I stayed in before didn’t pay much attention to the details, so I should experience it for the first time to a certain extent. When I went to a house with a butler, I was very fortunate to meet a handsome, friendly, modest and polite butler-Liu Hu butler, I gave him a 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 praise, Liu Hu Liu Hu! ! ! Although we only got together for a short two days, he gave us the most considerate service, which made our entire travel process extremely smooth and the experience was invincible.
        At first, I didn’t know where I saw the butler service provided by the Aubao Hotel. It felt like a gimmick and illusory, but when I just checked in and arrived at the room, when I received a phone call, I was pleasantly surprised to find that this is not false, it is true To be honest, when you come to an unfamiliar place, it would be heart-warming if there is someone who can help you when you need it. My housekeeper is like this. After adding WeChat at the beginning, the housekeeper sent it. A few days of very official and professional words made me a little stunned and didn't know where to start, but the speed at which the housekeeper handles things is the most efficient accelerator for improving my favorability to him. With such an existence, chat with him slowly and tentatively. The housekeeper is also very caring, gentle and down-to-earth. As long as you are willing to chat with him, he will answer all your questions very carefully. It may seem a little rusty at first. But gradually I will have doubts. The first person I think of is the housekeeper. I realize that we have become friends and not just the housekeeper. When you have a problem, ask him for help. He is also very good. Happy, it proves that you recognize his work, and he is also very pleased; on the way to play later, my housekeeper and I chatted frequently, which caused my little friends to feel sorry for my housekeeper, hehe🤪
        As you can see from the pictures I uploaded, the housekeeper will give you corresponding solutions according to your problems, and will even tell you after solving it first, the mobility processing ability is Max! You can always trust Liu Hu! 😜My butler will also share with me his previous experience of playing and give me some very useful suggestions, which is really worry-free!
        Finally, because I really like my butler so much, I found the butler and took a group photo before picking up my luggage at the end of the tour the next day. This trip to Haihua Island went smoothly even if it was affected by the weather. Because of the help of the housekeeper😘Thank you🫶, hard work🌺, looking forward to the next trip to Haihua Island🎬

Due to the large number of people, breakfast is served at different times and peaks. The twin room is much smaller than the family room. Didn't pay attention when booking. One room includes breakfast and the other does not. When we checked in, the young man Yu Xinyuan gave us two free breakfasts. The service staff are very nice. They will greet you with a smile and wave when they meet you. This is a good point. impression. The downside is that there is no refrigerator in the room. We have to put some medicines in the refrigerator. It is a little inconvenient to go to the storage room to get them every time. Also, although the hotel provides printing services, it has to be charged and charged. Not cheap, 5 yuan a piece, many hotels provide it for free, which I think is a bit unreasonable. Overall, the hotel's price/performance ratio is really high, much cheaper than the Hilton Twin Towers, and it's great for family travel.

The hotel has a free shuttle bus for passengers. We stayed at the hotel for 26 nights. When you check in, you are greeted warmly by the front desk staff. The undulating carpet of the Glacier Castle is like the blue sea. Once you enter the room, the blue walls and bedside tables, as well as the water cup and trash can decorated with the cooling mascot, the little penguin 🐧, give people a beautiful feeling like a fairy tale castle. The entire hotel from the front desk to the cleaning staff are courteous and warm to the guests, making people feel at home. The rich Chinese and Western breakfast is also delicious.

msg:The original plan was to visit Haihua Island for two days, so I only booked a room for two days. When I actually arrived, I felt very satisfied with the hotel service, and the whole island was amazing. Whether it's a play project or a hotel, it's worth checking in deeply, so I stayed for another day, and I easily checked in the water park and the rare and characteristic botanical garden (I bought a ticket for a single person to enter the park twice a day, to see the plants during the day and watch the plants at night. Lantern Festival), looking at the hotel through the treetops of the botanical garden at night is another artistic conception. There is enough time to taste the food in the food street and also open the Dream Sea Flower Island performance show, and also have a little more understanding of the surrounding area and the hotel. This morning, I took the free bus to Island No. 2 and Island No. 3. I went back to the hotel and went up to the 18th floor. Looking down at the castle atrium, the sea and the twin towers from a different perspective, there are different beauties. The happiest is Mr. Han Chunchou who took the initiative. I thoughtfully offered to help me to check out until 2:00 pm, so I had an extra noon rest adjus**ent time when the hotel room was not tense. In the afternoon, I had the energy to take the high-speed train around the island to enjoy the scenery from Hainan to the nature. Thank you very much, both the beauties at the main station and the housekeeper Mr. Han have left a deep impression on me. I will share my feelings with my friends, just like watching No. 3, which is not fully completed under construction today. The island will have more beautiful scenery in the future, and the Aubao Hotel facing the sea will definitely become the first choice for new and old customers. Although it is still a special period affected by the epidemic, there are not many tourists, and both scenic spots and hotels are facing severe challenges. The challenge of the world is still not able to make it easy for international tourists to travel. I only hope that the epidemic will pass, the world will be peaceful, and the hotel may we all get better and better. Knowing the blessing and cherishing the fate, thank you for meeting!

Especially Liu Dashuai, the butler Liu, who was in charge of connecting me, contacted me before I checked in, sent me the transportation and play guides in advance, and helped me arrange the room in advance, which saved me time and effort, too. Excellent, must be seriously praised

msg:I arrived at the store on February 6, and when I opened the door, I saw that the hotel room was pitifully small. The bar was less than one foot wide, and the bathroom was so small that it was impossible to turn around. The decoration was very rough. The four cups are all plastic! The washbasin and toilet are children's products and are unusually small. The amount of water in the bath is very small, and the water outlet method cannot be adjusted. The glass windows in the room are dusty, and there is a sign that prohibits... Coffee took ten minutes. What is even more unimaginable is that we arrived at the breakfast room at 10:05 and found that there were no white water eggs and marinated eggs. We asked several times, but there was no result, and it was not delivered until 10:40. The Dura brand used in the toilet toilet in the hotel lobby, the flush button positions are all installed incorrectly, the urea-formaldehyde cover plate is not slow down, and the noise is very loud! The artificial marble in the rooms and halls is full of cracks. If it weren't for the island's environment and light show, this hotel could score zero! No matter from which point of view, this hotel cannot be five-star! It is recommended that Ctrip downgrade this hotel to three stars. At the same time, I hope the management of Evergrande can see this evaluation!

We stayed in the largest single hotel in the world, the Aubao Hotel with the most a**ospheric and shocking price and the most affordable price. More than 5,000 rooms are constantly coming and going, and they are very popular. Don't look at the crowd, just use the automatic check-in machine to get it in one minute. great! The service staff are courteous to the guests, and are especially patient and friendly when answering questions. The management of the hotel is also good. Although there are many people, it is not messy. The overall feeling is good! The breakfast is very rich and delicious! Li Chun, the manager of the lobby, took the initiative to call and ask us what help we needed. When he learned that we had a baby, he helped us to adjust the room and move our luggage. The service was especially thoughtful and warm, thank you young man! Chen Xianjuan, the supervisor on the 16th floor, and Yang Demin, the waiter, are also very enthusiastic. They clean the room very carefully and carefully. What needs to be solved immediately, please praise! Hope they keep working hard!

The dream performance at night was also watched by as many people as you. This time I went to the Rare Botanical Garden. As soon as I entered, the fragrance of flowers was fragrant, and the colorful Gesang flowers were everywhere. There are sunflowers, some are big and some are beautiful, especially there is an indoor exhibition hall. I see black calla lilies, orchids, and phalaenopsis in it. It really makes me linger.

msg:Talk about our Haihua Island experience. I read the strategy before staying at the Oubao Hotel on Haihua Island. It seems that the room is small and the breakfast is crowded with less vehicles. There are so many problems that I don't even want to go. Came with friends, went together, and found that many problems could be avoided. Individual tourists should live in a building far away from the tour group. The room is quiet and there are fewer people at breakfast. Choosing a battery train can avoid crowding. There are waiters who maintain order. . The restaurants are concentrated in the commercial street, there are many near the entrance and exit, and there are few inside. The exhibition hall depends on personal taste, which is average. You can take a car to see the scenic spots by the sea, but the outlet is not interesting. The light show is better in the church, and the observation tower is very general because it is not allowed to go on the bridge. Last but not least, be sure to communicate with the hotel's customer service consultant and arrange your schedule. We always keep in touch with the hotel customer service Hu Zhenyu, the efficiency is really high, and I am in a good mood. Thank you very much, Xiao Hu!

From the hotel, there are free buses and paid tourist trains to various scenic spots on the island, as well as shuttle buses to the high-speed rail station and Meilan Airport. Choosing to stay at this hotel is more convenient for tourists who land on the island. The standard room of this luxury hotel with more than 5,001 rooms is only 304 yuan per night. Who wouldn't choose it at such a cost-effective price. They also specially sent a staff member Fu Zhuangshen to guide us, which is really considerate service. The sea view room I stayed in with two breakfasts was only 423 yuan a night, and the buffet breakfast was quite good, and the value was 128 yuan. Only the occupancy rate seems to be very low. The hotel is divided into four areas: Glacier Castle, Desert Castle, Ocean Castle, and Forest Castle. It seems that only the first two castles are open, and the latter two have almost no guests. The lobby is super luxurious, and the square in front of the door is also built in European style. I really hope this hotel will one day be hard to come by.

Something unpleasant happened in between. Communicate with the front desk that after the desert room is withdrawn, let them reserve the suite of the ocean room, is it okay? After walking around at night, the room was gone. There was a staff at the front desk who changed my room twice without changing the room. We booked a large suite and he gave us a small suite. There is only one queen bed. I went to the room and said that the room type was wrong. I changed it again and it was still wrong. It was a parent-child room. Their customer service staff is also very rude. It also said that I can't refund the difference for you. You booked with Ctrip's official website, and it has nothing to do with our hotel. Finally changed to the glacier room. Their customer service flexibility and attitude feel uncomfortable. The lady in the lobby of the hotel and the waiter in the restaurant are very polite. There are also water service staff. I love glacier restaurants. The food inside is better than other restaurants. I recommend staying in the parent-child room if the family travels, there is no need for a large suite.

1. When the pick-up time is agreed, it is said that there is no car, and the customer is asked to wait, and finally find a car to check in;
2. The room service was called at one o'clock in the afternoon to deliver the quilt and the child's bed, and it was delivered one hour and ten minutes later. At that time, it was more than two o'clock in the afternoon, and no lunch was eaten;
3. The room service villa soaked in the hot spring, cleaned the hot spring pool and released water, but did not come over after 40 minutes;
4. I ordered takeout at night, said it was agreed to be delivered to the front desk and then arranged to be delivered to the guest room, but the front desk refused, saying that no one contacted them, the takeaway brother we went out to find took it in, and the villa stayed at the front desk and had to walk ten minutes In a few minutes, I spent 20 minutes looking for a takeaway brother outside, contacting customer service, and communicating with the front desk. It took half an hour to get the takeaway before and after, and it was past nine o'clock in the evening by the time we ate.
5. After checking out and leaving, the customer service said that the car could not come in because it was inconvenient to drive in. The family walked from the villa to the front desk with three suitcases to make their car.
6. The service inquired before check-in is gone after check-in and departure. The hotel customer service manager said that I misunderstood the service content. Their car does not enter the villa area or send it to the parking lot. Then I want to ask, How can we travel in such a remote villa area?
7. To sum up, the hotel can ignore the customer's feelings and say what they say. The customer can only eat coptis in a dumb way. I can't argue about anything. After all, the manager has the final say in the hotel. I can only say that I will choose to have it next time. Hotels with standard service procedures and attitudes can avoid such a situation of spending money and being angry.

msg:I am very satisfied with this trip to the Aubao Hotel. First of all, Han Chunchou, the lobby manager, was very warm and thoughtful from the inquiries, check-in and various play tips at the beginning of the reservation. The hotel has a rich variety of breakfasts, and it is necessary to take a small train. Although some parts of the island have not been built, the environment is clean and the air is fresh. Every landscape is worth visiting.

msg:I took my parents there for the Lantern Festival on the 15th of the first ***** month. I heard that this hotel was 99 yuan a night. During the Spring Festival, I booked a glacier-themed room for 507 yuan including two breakfasts. It was so disappointing! Not to mention that the hotel room is very small, the bathroom is very small, and it is not a dead corner, but it is dirty as seen with the naked eye! ! ! There is also a shower room with blocked water, half of the washing, wearing clothes and calling to repair the sewer! ! ! All in all, the experience of staying here is really bad, will not stay again! ! !

msg:Aubao Hotel has been open for more than a year. I have heard of it. The sea view room I booked can barely see the side sea of No. 2 island p1, p9 is a forest theme randomly given by the room view of the parent-child theme room, and the hotel lobby is a fairy tale. Parent-child hotel, a small and well-regulated hotel package, there is a self-service front desk for check-in, and there are also people who are enthusiastic to help self-service. The staff inside and outside the hotel are very warm and welcoming, and the business training is in place.
On the 8th of the beginning of the year, it was still crowded with people, and then the surface of Henghai Huadao is almost perfect, and the single-family villas behind are either unfinished or under construction. The front row on the left side of Food Style Street is indeed very full, but the more you go in, many are not settled in, boasting about the museum in the middle, only a few brands of Outlets on the right side are open, and most of the style street is empty. , it's good to find a photo background.
Let’s talk about the traffic on the island. It was originally planned to be able to drive into the hotel, but a centralized parking lot in the Central Park was built. The peak crowd at noon made the hotel shuttle bus on the island, and the toll trains around the island were crowded with people. , walking back to the parking lot from the hotel is faster than taking a car, getting off the car in the parking lot without paying attention to the area code, the roof camera can't recognize the license plate, many people are looking for a car in the garage, the central park is very large, and the navigation is only the first time I found it on p1 Looking for Sunshine Parking Lot p2 for a long time, this is a major slot in the island's traffic.

msg:Accompanied my family to check in Haihua Island for the second time, and this time I chose to stay at the Internet celebrity Oubao Hotel. When I arrived at noon, I chose the front desk to check in. Because there are elderly people who need to be taken care of, I want the room to be closer, and I have to get a breakfast bracelet. I queued for 15 minutes.
The room is not big, about more than 20 square meters, clean and tidy, the decoration is a**ospheric, the small parts are complete, the facilities are new, and there is a fruit plate.
Because some rooms have not been cleaned out, the arranged rooms are still far away. After the check-in and rest, the manager of the lobby took the initiative to call in the afternoon and said: There are already close rooms, and we can exchange them. I feel very warm. The spirit of taking the initiative to serve customers, expressing gratitude
The breakfast is good, same as most 5 star hotels.

It is really a bonus for the hotel to have such staff. The overall supporting facilities are currently worth the price, although there are many projects under construction. It is open, but there is no problem with playing for 3 days. The food street is perfect for attracting inves**ent. It brings together various brand chain restaurants. It can be said that you can eat anything you want, and the price is reasonable and there is no price increase. Wuguo Hot Spring is also very good, there is no peculiar smell. The place is huge and overall highly recommended.

msg:The first time I came to Haihua Island, Li Zhenyu, the lobby deputy of Aubao Hotel, contacted us throughout the whole process, and communicated with us at any time from parking to check-in to check-out, and the efficiency was very high. It also made us feel familiar, as if we were back at an old friend's house.
It was a pleasure to stay at the hotel for two days. We chose the desert-themed parent-child room. The room is very large, and there is a 1.3-inch bed and a small tent. The children like it very much. Breakfast is reserved in advance from 8:00 to 9:00, there is no queue, and it is very rich. The elderly and children are very satisfied. Zhenyu also gave the children anti-mosquito bracelets and fruit bowls, which were so sweet.
There is no self-driving car in Haihua Island. The hotel has very convenient transportation. There is a small train at the door. It only takes a few minutes to go to the Food City Aquarium to watch the sea. In short, the trip to Haihua Island was very pleasant, and I look forward to coming back next year!

msg:Compared with the price of Sanya, the price of Haihua Island is too down to earth! Opel Hotel is divided into different themes such as glacier, desert, forest, ocean, etc. It is the largest single hotel in the country. There are many people but it is not chaotic. The self-service machine checks in and out in minutes, and the breakfast is eaten in different time periods. There is also a nucleic acid testing point on the second floor, so you don’t have to look everywhere! All aspects are great, but the sound insulation is average, and the children next door can clearly hear the yelling. The Wuguo Hot Springs must be visited. It tastes like Bali. The Ocean World is similar to other places, and the victory is great. Some parks such as Duty Free City and Children's World have not yet opened, and the whole is still in the trial operation stage.
🚗 Transportation: There is a free shuttle bus from the hotel after entering the island and parking in the parking lot. There are free buses and paid small trains on the island. The small train is 35 yuan for 5 times, and it is valid on the same day.
🔔Service: There are many restaurants on the island which are very convenient. Fire Palace, Xiaolongkan, KFC, McDonald's, Nai Xue... moderate prices.

It is not difficult to see that Evergrande is really heading for recession, the prosperous surface, the actual decline! The management is very chaotic, eager to make money, I live in the Aubao Hotel, you can't enter directly by car, you need to take a shuttle bus, you have to wait for 40 minutes, the interval is very long, you can't call taxis and Didi, the only replacement is the hotel's Sightseeing bus, 150 yuan for 5 minutes. The island is very big, and many venues are under construction or closed. There are less than 10 newly opened outlets, and there are no first-line brands. There are many restaurants in the street, but the price is doubled for foreign products, even McDonald's! In addition to the journey, you can only take a small train. It takes at least half an hour to line up at the starting station, and you can't get on if no one gets off the train. In a word, the management quality of small nose and small eyes. This kind of business thinking and method treats the guests as the slaughtered objects, and sooner or later will shoot themselves in the foot

A word is messed up, which is similar to crowding the bus in the 1980s. Check-in is fast, but the hotel room is very small, definitely not a five-star hotel. The service is really poor. We contacted the concierge the night before and said that he would take us to the parking lot to pick up the car at 6:30 the next day. He said that the car could be sent to the concierge when he left the next day. We waited for a while. Twenty minutes later, the car finally arrived. There was a car of people. The driver didn't ask any questions. He drove away. As a result, the other passengers got in the wrong car, and the driver didn't ask us for advice. He also corrected that he didn't give money, and he didn't make an appoin**ent... When we arrived at the parking lot, the hotel residents had free parking fees, but because there was no one on duty, we spent 15 yuan to drive out of the parking lot. Personally do not recommend, it is recommended to go in the off-season and stay at the Hilton. (One thing to say, the island itself is not interesting, and the Spring Festival is still very cold)

The hotel's facilities have a closed swimming pool, no gym, the room is super small, can't fit a bigger suitcase, and the water pressure is very low. Pure sleeping place, but still clean!

If it is in Zhejiang, it will cost thousands of dollars , 2 We arrived in the early morning, because there were elderly people, the front desk helped us to check in early at 6:30, thank you very much, check-in and check-out are all luggage carried by the concierge, thank you very much 🙏 The bad place, 1 is The experience is not very good, the crowd is crowded, there are queues for breakfast, and there are queues for tables. It just happened that 3 people sat down to eat. After a while, someone reminded me that there was not much time to eat, so embarrassing, we didn’t sit down for a while, alas… … We had a bad mood for breakfast on the first day, so we didn’t go to breakfast the next day, and we didn’t ask for a refund! I wasted 2 breakfasts, 2 lobby, and the appearance is the same, but we live in a room, and we pay more attention to the experience. The room is very small, and it is surprising that there is no refrigerator. It is summer here, how can there not be a small refrigerator? 3. The sound insulation is too bad.

The scale of the family is here, and there is really no way... When we checked out, we had a lot of luggage and a lot of luggage. We moved from the ground to the downstairs to find a parking space, and the driver didn't help us to get off. It would be fine if we drove the car to the parking garage. He didn't drive, saying that there were too many people. As a result, we got off because there were not many cars, and we didn't say anything without luggage. , 3 of us have 6 large bags, the parking lot is too big, and my husband is exhausted... It stands to reason that such a large parking lot, customers have a lot of luggage, they should help us drive, but the driver will not drive, nor help! In general, I feel that it is okay to experience 1 to 2 nights, and it is not recommended to live for a long time.

msg:Aubao Hotel, the penultimate stop of our trip around the island of Hainan, the hotel's stay experience is really not very good, especially some services are not good, let's make a small summary: let's talk about the good things first, look at the sea Huadao night light show (recommended, it is free) If you need to stay here for one night, there are not many hotels to consider, so this is an option; the price of the hotel is not expensive, and the price is relatively reasonable. Besides, if there is a requirement for accommodation, I strongly do not recommend it here. This hotel is built in an a**osphere, but the room is very, very small. The decoration of the room is simple or even a bit shabby. It is similar to a city economy hotel and cannot be compared with a resort hotel In comparison, it can only be said to sleep for one night. The sanitation of the room is not very good. There are fruit residues and hair left by previous guests on the floor of our room. There are many water stains in the bathroom shower and toilet, which makes people feel very uncomfortable. Finally, I want to mention a special point, the car can't drive to the parking lot downstairs of the hotel, let it park in the parking lot of the conference center far away, and then walk in the huge underground parking lot to find the shuttle bus, and then queue up (we queued up One hour, few cars), the experience is very uncomfortable, very tossing, it is already more than eleven o'clock in the evening when I arrive at the hotel, and I have tossed for almost two hours. The feeling of playing on the second day, the overall planning is good, but it may be that Evergrande’s funds can’t keep up. Haihua Island is empty, and many facilities are either not open or closed. If you bring children, Ocean Paradise is still worth a visit. Go, the night light show is worth a visit, but there is one point to criticize: before the Spring Festival on the island, there are not many passengers, but wherever you go, you have to take a small train or a shuttle bus, because there are not many cars and some unreasonable planning often requires long queues team.

msg:Very good stay experience. Entering the Auberge Hotel is like stepping into a fairy tale world, and the children are immediately excited. We booked a parent-child room and two sea view rooms. Parent-child room (full price for 1.5m breakfast, half price for 1.2-1.5m breakfast) is just right for a family of four. The parent-child room is quite large, with toys and special toiletries for children. It is a particularly dreamy theme hotel. Great value for money. I saw a bad review before saying that the quilt was not changed, and I was still a little nervous. The truth is just the opposite. When I got to the room, I found that the bedding was very clean and tidy, and I was pleasantly surprised. The mattress firmness was also very good, and I slept beautifully all night. One of the sea view rooms has a good sea view, and one has a side view of the sea. The room is really not big, similar to the feeling of Hampton and Holiday Inn, but it is clean and tidy, and the elderly also have a good rest. Breakfast is eaten at different times, and it generally feels like a hotel in Macau, so although there are many people, the order is still very good. Some comments wrote about the problem of the hotel reception team. In fact, regardless of the team or individual tourists, most of them are family trips with children, and the reception capacity of the hotel is no problem. So, never mind. The only thing to remind guests is that Haihua Island is an artificial island. Oubao is on Island 1, and the parking space is limited. You need to take a shuttle bus to Island 3 or Island 1. You must be mentally prepared for this. When there is a lot of traffic, the car runs every 10 minutes, and it takes a few minutes to arrive, which is quite convenient. In addition, it is recommended that you book 2 nights, there are light shows, children's world paradise, hot springs, 1 night really can't be arranged.
The service attitude of the staff is very good. When I have breakfast, every staff member greets me. Good morning, it is so warm.
Thanks to the customer service manager Chen Sheng, because the elderly at home have inconvenient legs and feet, it is really difficult to walk back to the hotel after watching the light show. We did not find a roundabout bus stop. After asking the hotel for help, a battery car was specially arranged to pick us up, especially for the sake of customers. We are very moved.
There is a chance to stay at the Aubao Hotel again. It is recommended that families with children choose a parent-child room.

The attitude of the service staff is very good, I feel their enthusiasm and happiness. Self check-in saves a lot of time, which is great. The only dissatisfaction is that the car cannot be driven in, and the island can only be entered by a shuttle bus. It is very inconvenient for people with large luggage.

msg:I booked two standard rooms, self-service random allocation of rooms, stayed in the forest castle, and went around like the ocean and the glacier castle. The hotel is quite big, the room is small, the environment is good, and the hygiene is good. Even if the hotel picks up the group, the people are very messy. On the contrary, there is no one in the building, and the room is very quiet! The buffet is acceptable, but the dishes are generally overheated. The scenery is acceptable, but the expected light show is too disappointing. Many venues such as amu*****t parks are not open at all, and there are no performances in Fengqing Street. The food street is more lively, and the food is expensive and unpalatable. The service can't keep up, and it is not recommended to go in the short term!

Haihua Island is divided into 1, 2 and 3 islands.
Island No. 2 and No. 3 are all homestay villa areas, and there is almost no entertainment. Many homestays are only 200 yuan a night, which is very cheap. But the environment is normal, that is, an ordinary family.
Island 1 includes all the food, drink and entertainment, food, clothing, housing and transportation, and almost all tourists who come to Haihua Island will be on this island. So it would be more convenient to choose to live here.
🏨
However, Haihua Island has not yet been fully completed, many facilities are not perfect, and buildings are also under construction. Therefore, there is only one five-star hotel on No. 1 Island for the time being, the Opel Hotel. Almost 80% of tourists will choose here.

The hotel cannot drive to the door and rely on the shuttle bus. The waiting time for the bus makes you doubt your life.
Also, the No. 1 round-the-island bus and No. 2 round-the-island bus on the island also make you wait until the flowers wither. If the round-the-island bus gets on the bus from the starting point, it will be even worse until the car is so full that the flies can’t fly in. I don’t want to drive and just wait until the o’clock to drive. I’m really speechless if I don’t change it during the epidemic. This place can only be played once and there will be no second time.

酒店整體服務氛圍很好，標誌性的揮手禮很有親和力。更為獨特的是，本次入住享受了一次無聲無形的服務。大堂經理胡振宇通過微信為我們提供全過程保姆式服務。感覺我們在歐堡有這麼一個熟人一樣，關照無微不至，提醒適時到位。離店的時候小朋友收到一份拼圖禮物，甭提多高興了。真心感謝胡經理的用心！雖未謀面，倍感親切。

✨酒店房內整潔乾淨，這次住的是沙漠城堡主題～床墊非常舒服，感覺進入了一個童話世界～
✨本次入住工作人員都非常專業，尤其是前台人員陳妹英，很熟練的應對我的諮詢，能夠及時提供迴應與服務，我很滿意！期待下次來住到不同的風格～

海花島真的好美，美食也多，晚上我們去吃了一家明洞 王妃烤肉店，超級棒！這邊也強烈推薦！而且吃飯的商業街建築都特別有特色，彷彿去了異國他鄉吃飯一樣，氛圍感滿滿~3-4人餐分量很大，不要多點了，真的吃的很撐。
真是一次不錯的入住的體驗~

很開心能夠在海花島留下一段美好的回憶，下次再會。

msg:再次入住海花島歐堡酒店，這次來最驚喜的可能就是遇到了春夏之交的海花島，實在是太美了。上次來是冬天，即使在海南也沒有看到很多鮮花，但這次來真的看到了很多美麗的植物。紅色的雞蛋花真的很好看，比起黃色的更加驚艷美麗。而且這次也是第一次觸摸到了木棉花的果實，握在手裡暖洋洋的。還有和火焰一般熱烈的鳳凰花，真有點鳳凰浴火重生的味道。海花島真是我們植物愛好者的福音，希望島上的管理人員可以在一些特色植物旁粘貼植物的介紹，給更多的遊客普及熱帶植物知識。
酒店和上次一樣，感受到服務人員工作的熱情，尤其是現在客人不多，服務比起上次更加驚喜。在此也特別感謝接待我們的工作人員振宇和金戈，兩位小夥子給我們的行程提供了不少幫助，給了我們很多中肯的建議，給他們一個大大的贊。

很有童趣的酒店，以後來海南都會帶娃來這裏~

總體來説這次的海花島之旅還是很滿意的，酒店服務、衞生、早餐都是達到預期目標的，就是房間確實小了一些，不過性價比很高啦。

msg:本次入住海花島歐堡酒店的經歷讓我感到既意外又感動。

在入住期間，不幸的是，因為一位實習工作人員的誤操作，我的孩子被房門撞傷（圖1冰敷後），特別是當寶寶在撞頭後五個小時內出現了三次嘔吐的症狀時，酒店經理劉曉虎先生立即協調車輛凌晨送往洋浦醫院（圖2車中安排路線）並全程陪同進行了急診檢查。他的及時行動和專業處理讓我感到非常安心。

然而，事情並未就此結束。隔天早晨，孩子又出現了嘔吐和暈厥情況，在這個緊急時刻，酒店姚素芳經理在匆忙間甚至來不及更換工裝（圖3醫院裏忙前忙後），就立即協調並陪同我們再次前往醫院。她的細心照顧和貼心關懷讓我感受到安慰。

雖然因為意外事件，我們未能享受到海洋世界的樂趣，但是酒店為了我們的安全和健康，安排工作人員王先生專程代駕護送我們，讓我們感到温暖。

這次意外事件，我深刻地感受到了海花島歐堡酒店團隊對客人安全和健康的重視。他們的迅速反應、周到的服務和無微不至的關懷讓我對酒店的印象大大超出了我的預期。分享並強烈推薦這家酒店給所有尋求温馨體驗和周到服務的遊客。

但是酒店內部房間環境堪憂，樓層內通往房間的內部路地毯很臟，看上去又舊又難看，有種來到了幾十年前很差酒店的感覺。房間內部牆面各種劃痕和少量小坑都能看到牆皮的白色。現在這個年頭，這個級別的酒店居然還是不能投屏的電視也是讓我很錯愕。床單有紅油漬，聯繫客房服務給換掉了。
之後有酒店回訪人員主動打來電話，反饋後給我換了房間，回訪人員呂敬小姐姐給我們換了房間，服務態度極好，有禮貌很温和，這才讓我消了氣，打消了給酒店全打一星的沖動。但是我以上的反饋依舊是不吐不快，還是希望酒店能有所調整，明明靠使用瓷磚就能解決的問題，但是酒店內部的毛地毯和牆漆真的顯得非常客房非常陳舊和老化。

msg:首先，這個就是比較大的四星酒店，通過攜程定房，還需要現場交全款。
其次，入住體驗特別差，5000多個房間，在12點～15點辦理入住是個多麼壯觀的場面啊！害怕入住很久，所以我去的比較早，11點50排隊，12點50辦理完，前台告訴我房間沒有清掃出來，要等半個小時。於是我帶着4個70+的長者和兩個孩子，就坐在旁邊等。半個小時後，也就是1點20我又開始排隊，下午2點終於沒有耐心排隊了，插個隊，告訴我房間還沒清理好。我看有的客人在定早餐時間，我就去自助機，然後自助機系統告訴我：沒！有！入！住！信！息！
也就是我白折騰了。最後給我的解釋是，我排的那個前台不專業，訊息沒提交上去。我真想罵人。
還有，評價一下酒店的環境，就是一個比較大的四星，五星夠不上，和全季差不多，雙床房很小，站着的地面沒有床大，親子三人房還可以。客房服務也很一般般，凌晨兩點樓上有孩子跑跑跳跳。

五國温泉城泰國館不在門票內有點不理解，要在泰國館單獨購票。海洋世界看點也真是太多了，運營管理顯得很專業，可圈可點！
最暖心的是兩晚的歐堡入住，第二晚小朋友想住喜歡的森林主題，在入住率這麼高的假期，大堂經理邱英媛還是耐心地幫忙做了調整，感謝感謝！！！

ps，還值得一提的是自助餐，能吃到12點的自助早餐，對我這種懶貨來説，真的是要感動地哭了。小火車也很好，海洋公園也不錯，衞生也很好，建築和設計就不用説了，牆上天花板上都是彩繪，這是當意大利教堂搞呢。總之海花島讓我成功圈粉許家印。

酒店負責人説  他們工作人員工作十幾個小時理解下他們有情緒，下次入住補兩張早餐劵給我
這麼大的酒店，就是這樣對待客人，我是來旅遊放鬆心情的，不是來你們酒店理解你們工作十幾小時的情緒不滿，然後發泄性侮辱我的。也不是來領你那兩張下次的早餐劵的，我定酒店是要我與孩子都能得到一個好的休息的。

msg:這是我們第一次去海花島，也許也是最後一次。
實話實説，一開始酒店給我的感覺特別不好，接送巴士下車以後沒有明確指示到酒店大堂的以至於我們跟隨人流去到旅行團登記入住的地方，不止我們一家人，還有好幾個散客也是這樣。人特別多，特別亂。排了好久被告知走錯地方了。
後來到酒店大堂，也沒有明確指示應該在哪辦理入住，問了人才知道。辦理入住的服務枱也特別多人，還有人不排隊，就是説給人感覺特別不好。
在快要排到我的時候接到酒店電話，在此要特別感謝趙博經理的服務。我們加錢升級了冰川主題親子房，孩子們很喜歡。
需要注意的是酒店11-2月泳池是關閉的，需要乘車去到健身中心的室內游泳館游泳，但是水温也不是很好，孩子們遊了之後説冷，嘴脣都紫了。
整體來説海花島給我們的感覺就是可惜了，這麼大的投入，硬件很豪華，軟件跟不上。很多地方都過度收費，如果不改變，以後不會再去了。

另外説一下房間，我入住的是森林城堡，裝修很有童趣，如果帶小朋友的話會很喜歡的。

msg:鷗堡酒店是在攜程搜海花島酒店跳出來的第一個，感覺住的人多，應該各方面相對比較到位，於是就定了。客觀來評價的話，我覺得要分幾方面分別打分：
酒店設施： 一般。因為是主打親子，所以酒店裡孩子特別多，有些吵，私密做的不夠到位。房間的裝修和配置也都以小童喜歡的色彩為主，對於單獨出行的成人來説，酒店的裝修和細節確實很難和星級酒店相提並論，沒有那種高級感，多少有點鄉鎮結合的感覺。
酒店配套：那可就更加鄉村了，不管是酒店裡配備的一些購物商店還是自助餐廳，真的是很難和三亞的度假村媲美。尤其我對於酒店的自助早餐，以及我購買的自助晚餐，我都真的不能恭維。早餐不管哪一個時間段，人都非常多，多到毫無放鬆下來，看看窗外風景安靜享受早飯的沉着感，而且西點、中式點心都不好吃，西點不精緻，中式麪點選擇不多，製作餐點的服務生也培訓不到位。我要了一個單面煎，然後直接手忙腳亂地給我放在了我盤子的巧克力醬上，我吃了一個甜的荷包蛋………實在是對不起128/位的標準。每次住酒店自助早餐是我非常看重的一個環節，我衹能説確實一份價格一份貨。酒店的這個價格衹能在早餐上做減法了。
管家服務：實話實説，還是要給高度評價的，尤其是我的那位服務小哥哥黃鵬輝，從入住到退房，全程都給予了很大的幫助，而且反饋和響應都特別及時，態度也熱情友善。這是本次入住最大的善意和亮點。
海花島應該也算是開發比較成熟的一個旅遊勝地了，但和三亞的海棠灣之類的酒店比，確實還是有很長的一段路需要努力。硬件軟件和營造的氛圍，還是需要多借鑒。寧願價格上去，打造得精緻一點。否則現在確實鄉村結合部的感覺更濃烈，總莫名其妙讓我感到被消費降級了，花了點錢還是不太滿足的感覺。可能衹適合為了帶孩子來玩水上世界和遊樂場的遊客，真正希望休假放鬆，滿眼風景的人來説，還是會選擇三亞。

車子抵達酒店，工作人員在大堂轉來轉去也沒有人主動來幫我們搬運行李。入住很快，是刷臉的很方便。
早餐更值得吐槽，饅頭一半冷一半熱一半軟一半硬，油條老的咬不動，想讓工作人員幫忙拿紙巾，揮了半天手人家裝沒看到。最最離譜的是節假日可能入住了人多了，好多人找不到位置，我們兩大一小坐個小方桌，還有人要來和我們拼桌，我們還沒吃完，兩波等位置的已經為了誰先等已經要吵起來了。100多一位的自助早餐，這種水準簡直沒誰了，還好也不怎麼好吃，我們隨便對付兩口就走了。
酒店雖然很大，過了旺季可能考慮運營成本，海洋和叢林區都關閉了，游泳通道也衹開了冰川。小童樂園基本也沒什麼東西可以玩。

二、當訂三間房以上，在剛好入住時間取房訂單也備註要安排在同層，卻説不能，後來加錢在同層還是給個比原來房還狹小的房間還要在尾房.重點房門還開不了
三、當要換房還要重新排隊，問題不是顧客問題，卻沒有另一個通道或前台人員處理問題，要跟來辦理入住的顧客一起排隊花了半小時以上，就是續住都花了我一個小時以上（重點重新再辦理入住卻聽到別人同在冰川同房型四個房都能安排在同層。）
差評你值得擁有！

設施：一般，這次早餐感覺是是最差的，早餐品種很少，小童半價68元，成人128元，分段就餐，品種少不説，菜品都涼了，不好吃，餐標一百多真的不值這個價．現在海花島到處都是坑，代步小火車68一位，雙子塔大橋燈光秀沒有了，反正到處都要收費。收費標準還不低。

前台接待和服務一般般，大年三十下午的男服務員，有點嚴肅，綳臉。態度一般般！
與五星級酒店的前台素質有差距。


大廳裏幫自助住房的服務員有禮貌，見客人主動打招呼。

+ 公共區域環境很好，設施齊全，有小童樂園，非常適合有小朋友的家庭
+ 服務很滿意，絕大部分的員工都很友好，房間需要維修的地方打個電話人馬上就到了，問題解決的也快
+ 早餐午餐都在這裏吃的自助，品種挺多，味道也不錯
+ 交通方面，接駁車，免費樂園專車都在酒店門口，還可以租童車，非常方便，好評
+/- 泳池設施適合小孩子，玩的很開心。不過泳池最深也就1米6的樣子，不適合個子高的人
- 全天人都是非常多，到哪裡都是熙熙攘攘非常吵鬧，對聲音敏感的人可能會很煩躁
- 客房就是個二星級的樣子吧，也沒啥不好的，衹是我們住的房間電視遙控器和衞生間的門都壞了

msg:第一，房間非常小，住得時間久了很壓抑。不適合帶娃長期住。第二，島上秩序比較亂。景點來回酒店要乘坐免費公交車。據説是每30分鐘一班，但是某幾個時間點是一小時一班的，沒有時刻表，打電話問前台都説不確定發車情況。這對帶娃遊玩了一天的遊客很不友好，小孩又困又累，還不知道幾點有公交。VIP付錢的小車居然是要打電話叫的，不打電話預約就不拉人。建議應該出公車時刻表，VIP小車應公開收費等待在景區門口。第三，早上吃早餐拉個尺子在餐廳門口攔小孩。超過一釐米就要補餐費。明知道酒店住的都是帶娃的，就上趕着收錢。早餐也是非常一般，收費128的價格感覺也就28的水準。第四，一號島上飲食比較差，基本買不到什麼吃的，新鮮水果更是少。帶娃住酒店本來就圖個省力。結果並沒有省力氣，吃的也不好。

msg:房間不錯，景觀還可以。帶兩娃的安排了一張雙人床和小孩上下床，還挺貼心的。 但是我在晚上11點多致電客房服務要求送食用冰塊的時候被告知餐廳已經下班提供不了食用冰塊，在再三要求下用一個保鮮袋送來了小半袋冰塊，感覺挺low的，畢竟這麼大一間酒店而且硬件設施還是不錯的酒店這些軟性服務就相對差一點了。 
在我還沒到酒店的時候就有一位自稱酒店管家打電話來問我入住訊息，説幫我提前準備好房間，一開始我還以為是詐騙或者強制消費，在問清楚後認為應該是真的， 加了管家任俊的微信，有問題在微信裏提問，管家回覆即是清楚明瞭有禮貌，還是挺不錯的。
住了兩個晚上，其中一天去島上的水上王國遊玩，在園區的公眾號“海花島酒店羣”裏購買了水上王國的門票，檢票時被告知學生是可以購買學生票儘管身高超過150。 檢票人員幫忙退票後在她的指引下到現場購票窗口重新購買了學生票順利進園遊玩。本來還挺開心的，可是退票的錢被退到了一個所謂的“儲值卡”上，在我離開酒店時詢問酒店前台退費事情被告知要打400電話質詢。諮詢後被告知衹能夠在島上園區消費不能原路退還。投訴上級回覆就更加讓人生氣了，直接説不能原路退還，這就他們的最終回覆沒有任何協商的餘地。最後我打電話到海南12345投訴要求把費用原路退還。 直到我行程結束都沒有再收到酒店或園區的回覆。這是強制行消費行為，欺騙消費者或許還有詐騙嫌疑。錢不多衹有208元，但這這種強制消費行為是不能接受的，我會維權到底。

施設很好，房間沒有體重秤，遺憾！
衞生很乾凈，打掃很規範。沒有布拖鞋，打電話到總枱，服務員送來的。

酒店太大，管理有點亂，可以理解。不通過服務員找不到房間。自助餐很豐富，但人太多，歺位不夠，搶歺位。取食品排隊，歺食分類太遠，很難想象這是高檔酒店。入住時總枱問我早歺幾點，我説八點，感到很貼心。我想這是客人多分時段進入安排。結果根本不是這樣，幾點進都可以，手環一收進吧。希望酒店管理層儘快調整，否則會毀了聲譽。

【環境】島上衹有兩家酒店，“歐堡酒店”比較平民化。但是設施和裝潢並不平民，房型多，款式多
【服務】必須點名表揚👍“歐堡酒店”的酒店管家：鄒帥。小哥哥一路關注住客的行程，提供優質的服務👍

msg:辦理入住的時候雖然出現了小插曲不是都那麼的順利，但住的環境還是不錯的，小寶就很喜歡這家酒店，建議入住該酒店還是連續住兩晚會更方便也能全園玩到，因為時間關係我們衹住了一晚

msg:開始分到沙漠城堡的房間，房間略小且熱。
跟總枱反映後，前廳主管杜卓得知便幫忙換了更大且温度適合的房間。此外，因我腳扭到不便，杜主管還幫忙安排禮賓幫忙把行李送到房間，服務到位，體驗不錯又續住了一晚。

msg:設施智能化程度較差，服務人員少，游泳服務不到位，不理想，可能是客人少的原因。衹有一個男經理服務意識較好！但整體不太好～

msg:房間佈置很適合小孩，裏面設施也比較新，房間比較衞生！酒店游泳池沒開放，很失望！海花島遊玩性價比很低，島上很多設施都沒開放，島上很多商家都沒營業，生意很差！不會再來第二次！

msg:房間太小，早餐吃飯人太多，人擠人的感覺太差。還有看煙花，竟然沒看上，1號的煙火計劃是晚上10:30燃放，結果提前半個小時燃放，這不是笑話嗎！去海花島就是看煙火的，結果沒看上，什麼玩意啊！！！！！！
