All the facilities, spa, swimming pool, gym, sauna were all closed. Even the executive lounge was off limits. This was not mentioned when booking and I was unable to get any refund. It's a lovely hotel, but they really struggle to clarify if anything is actually operational post covid.

They should have a separate check in for large groups. The service was great however I had executive lounge access which was ok. Great service but ok food and drinks nothing special. The room was very clean except for a few big stains on the carpet. That‚Äôs always not a good look. I drive a car and needed parking and the parking was full Saturday night I could not park my car I had to find a spot on the street well away from the hotel. The traffic in and around the entrance is nuts, not much space for cars. Bad setup for cars coming in and out.

Although there were some minor incidents after arriving at the hotel, it was quickly handled and settled in, which was very good. The room is spacious, the bedding is comfortable, and the river view at night is amazing! Not only can you see the popular Yingwuzhou Bridge, but you can also see the Yellow Crane Tower and the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge from a distance, which is very photogenic!

He learned that I wanted to see the night view of the Yellow Crane Tower, and specially helped us upgrade the floor and room. The scenery was so beautiful. I was a little excited to see the Yangtze River in front of me, not to mention that I could see the Yellow Crane Tower from afar. There was no regret for this trip! In the evening, Manager Li Shuang also specially sent a plate of fruit and two glasses of refreshing juice. It was so considerate. This service was really amazing. I asked for a buckwheat pillow at night and slept very well. Breakfast can be eaten until 11:30, which is also unique. Here comes the point. You must go to the swimming pool. It is very, very photogenic, so amazing, so beautiful, so beautiful that it is indescribable, and it purifies your eyes. By the way, there is also a round pool with hot water, which is comfortable, and there are yoga mats on which you can pose for photos. Whether you can swim or not, you must go!

We asked an aunt to spray deodorant, but the effect was not obvious. Because we heard that the room was tight on the day of check-in, we thought we would just stay there. As a result, after a short rest, we received a call from the housekeeper Aimee. After I told her the situation, she changed us to a clean new room in a short while. She also thoughtfully installed an air purifier! Later, she also sent us fruit juice every night with hand-painted small cards. Very thoughtful! Because of Aimee's service, I feel that I will only stay at Hilton in Wuhan in the future!

msg:This time I came to Wuhan with my family. I spent a long time choosing the Yellow Crane Tower, and finally chose the Hilton Wuhan. At first, I was not familiar with the transportation and attractions in Wuhan. Fortunately, I received a greeting call from the housekeeper Aimee before checking in. He asked us about our preferences and requirements for the room and the time of arrival in Wuhan, and gave a very reasonable travel arrangement. I was very surprised by this, but Hilton's service was more than that. When we arrived at the hotel, the porter came to the door to help us with our luggage as soon as possible. After checking in, we returned to the room. On the way back to the room, the housekeeper Aimee also introduced us to the hotel's facilities and equipment and the address and business hours of the business premises. Let us deepen our understanding of the hotel. After arriving in the room and putting away the luggage, the housekeeper once again introduced the room and the use of various switch devices. The room was very clean. After a short rest, we came to Hanyang River Beach. It was still very pleasant to take a walk on the river beach. Aimee recommended the crab god to us through the hotel. There were already many people queuing at this time, but it was very delicious and worth waiting. The next day we went to the East Lake Scenic Area. We also spent a fulfilling day following the route planned by Aimee. We tasted many delicious snacks in Wuhan and appreciated the scenery of East Lake. Let me have a very good impression of this hotel and Wuhan. The most correct choice for this trip is to choose Wuhan Shimao Hilton Hotel, which is very close to various scenic spots. And there is also a caring one-to-one butler service, which is not available in many other hotels, so I would like to give this hotel a big thumbs up. Next time I come to the hotel and come to Wuhan, I will still choose here. Highly recommended.

msg:Not a hired helper, just a tourist
No exaggeration or criticism, overall evaluation: too low cost performance
5.2 Price: 1924 per night with breakfast, high-rise river view room
The experience was not good, so I didn't take many photos, too lazy to take photos

Environment: We lived on the 15th floor, with a river view, a wide angle to see the Yangtze River Bridge, and a small angle to see the Parrot Island Bridge; the outside scenery is OK, but the environment in the room is quite ordinary, the area is large, but it is quite ordinary and business, and the lighting is dim

Facilities: The hotel is 16 years old, the facilities are too old, everything is not smart, the TV is also blurry, the worst thing is that the faucet in the bathroom shower room is very difficult to operate, and it is not adjusted to a suitable temperature. It is either very hot or very cold. This facility is really not worthy of the price of 2000 per night and the Hilton brand

Sanitation: The sanitation is good, but because the facilities are too old and the lighting is dim, So the toilet, bathtub, bed, etc. all look old and dirty

Service: Full marks for service, the front desk and housekeeper are very enthusiastic, the only thing I can praise

Breakfast: It's just average. The breakfast I had in other hotels this morning was much richer than Hilton's, and there was also an electric pancake stand; I don't know if I didn't see it, anyway, Hilton didn't see the toast machine, and the food variety was not rich, it was just average

Location: Good location, there are many food around, and you can walk to Parrot Trail in a short time, where there are many late-night snack shops

Summary: I won't stay again unless it's 500 yuan a night; I stayed in 3 hotels during the May Day holiday, and the other two were too cost-effective; friends who really like the river view can choose it if they are on business trips, and if you have some requirements for facilities, the experience may not be very good; but it's an old hotel, so it's understandable

msg:The most powerful ability of a hotel is: the ability to help guests solve problems
After the May Day trip to Wuhan and Jingzhou, I came back to comment on the World Trade Hilton. I stayed in four hotels during this trip, and the best experience was this one in Hilton. Environment: five-star hotel standard, clean rooms, excellent lighting, river view room, nothing else to say. The location is very superior, the river view is first-class. In theory, it is not far to the Yellow Crane Tower and the Zhiyinhao. And there is a good thing about Hanyang, it is indeed not so congested. (I saw the congestion in Wuhan during the May Day) Service: It is one of the most important reasons for this review. First of all, I felt the professional reception of this hotel from the beginning of checkin. I was still on a conference call when I checked in, and the front desk lady quickly checked me in, and finally did not collect the deposit. It was expressed in a very good way. In fact, collecting pre-sale deposits is a common knowledge of all hotels, and it is a way to protect the interests of both guests and hotels. Not collecting deposits is more from the customer's perspective. I don't know if it is a standard in the sop, but this is to not disturb my work and quickly provide rooms to solve the conference environment problem. I think it is very good. It is worth learning from colleagues in the hotel industry. I would like to specifically praise the front desk lady around noon on the 29th. The one closest to the lobby. Finally, I would like to thank the experience ambassador Li Shuang. All the problems in the hotel were solved as soon as possible. It made me doubt whether I was staying in an 800-room hotel. I think Li Shuang's service exceeds the service quality of many 5k+ hotel butlers. Minor problems are solved from the perspective of the guests, instead of prevarication and reasons. The problem is solved quickly and the result is satisfactory. In this era when hotels are all about SOP, Hanyang World Trade Hilton is customer-centric and people-oriented. Excellent service. It adds a lot of sunshine and enthusiasm to Wuhan, which was about to be stormy in those two days. There are many delicious foods and many fun places in Wuhan. It is really great to choose World Trade Hilton this time. Thank you üôè I will choose you again next time.

There are afternoon tea and light meals in the evening, which you can do without going out.
There are also restaurants nearby, which is more convenient than the Nanjing Riverside Hilton.

Not far from the MRT station within 3 minutes
The overall environment - the swimming pool, breakfast restaurant, and dining area on the 28th floor can all see the Yangtze River.
A concept that makes you satisfied when you look at the Yangtze River

We can contact her anytime if we need anything. It feels like home. After arriving at the hotel, she arranged a high-floor room with a full river view for us as required, and carefully prepared two meaningful small gifts for the children. After staying for two days, my family was very satisfied. Thanks to Amelia for her service. Except for the slightly old facilities, everything else is very good. It is the first choice when visiting Wuhan!

2) When I checked out at 6 o'clock in the morning, the only staff at the front desk had no service attitude at all and looked cold.
3) The hotel cabinet door was tattered after opening, but it looked good on the surface;
4) The plastic of the hair dryer's air outlet was burned. 
How could the famous hotel management group Hilton allow such a situation to happen?

They answered all my questions and introduced them in detail. In short, there was no problem with the service. There is a problem, I don't know if it is with Ctrip or the hotel. The room I booked has brackets on Ctrip, indicating that it has a beautiful river view. I think it may be a misunderstanding of the word "beautiful". Anyway, the room I stayed in, standing at the window, saw a dirty platform. My last picture is the fact. I think this should be improved. Don't write the word "beautiful" anymore.

Because we only have one day to stay here and have to go out for sightseeing, we don‚Äôt have time. Fortunately, we met Manager Huang in the lobby to help coordinate and left two for the children. A portion of pastries and drinks. The children were super happy when they came back in the evening. They kept praising how delicious it was. Thank you so much, Manager Huang, for your help!

Facilities & hygiene: The hotel has complete facilities, clean and tidy, and the stay is very comfortable.

Environment: It is very close to the Youtiaozhou Yangtze River Bridge. It is very convenient to cross the river, the subway is also convenient, and it is also convenient to take a taxi. You can also pick up a carrot and run at the door (a favorite of children ~ haha)

msg:The scenery is really great, whether it is the room, restaurant or swimming pool, they are all beautiful. The sunrise in the morning and the Parrot Island Bridge at night are beautiful~
The disadvantage is that the minibar is empty, but there is happy hour and afternoon tea on the 28th floor, so it's okay.
The dinner buffet is not very cost-effective, so I don‚Äôt recommend it. It‚Äôs not as cost-effective as the breakfast buffet. I recommend staying in the hotel early. If you want to go out for fun, I recommend swimming in the swimming pool after breakfast and watching the bridge. It‚Äôs super beautiful. Of course, if the hotel housekeeper Amiee hadn‚Äôt told me that I could check out at 2 p.m., Our schedule will be hectic. Oh, on my birthday, the hotel also specially prepared a birthday cake, which was really great, and also specially prepared good night milk in the eveningü•õ. Overall, I feel that the price-performance ratio of more than 1,000 yuan is very high. Except for the hotel dinner buffet, I was very satisfied.

When he learned that there were children accompanying him, he upgraded the room to a river view room on the 18th floor. Hot milk and fresh fruit are delivered personally every night. Every day, I would take the initiative to ask if I need anything, and also help with information about the Liangjiang Cruise. The scenery of the Yangtze River outside the hotel window is beautiful, especially at night when the lights of the Parrot Yangtze River Bridge are lit up. Next time I go back to Wuhan, I will choose Shimao Hilton Hotel.

In total, it took more than half an hour. I'm upset. The room equipment is old and outdated. The view outside the window is not bad. However, the housekeeper is very nice and gave me fruits.

**Hotel service: Special praise, the beautiful housekeeper Lulu, the service is very good, considerate and enthusiastic!
**Other aspects: Among the five-star hotels in Wuhan, the one with the best river view must be the Shimao Hilton. Floor-to-ceiling glass provides an unparalleled first-line view of the Yangtze River Bridge, Parrot Island Bridge, and Yellow Crane Tower. It‚Äôs simply YYDS.
There is also a delicious crab god in the community downstairs of the hotel. Friends who like it must not miss itüòÅüòÅ

The hotel is in a good location, the room is large, there are enough elevators, and there is basically no need to wait. The bedding is comfortable, not too soft, and the sound insulation is good. Generally, no other sounds can be heard.

The room cleaning staff took the initiative to put the clothes into the closet and wrote a card. Thank you very much. I wanted to write some feedback below, but I couldn't find a pen. I suggest you prepare a pen in the room. It is also recommended to prepare a mouse pad, because the desk surface is made of glass and the laser mouse cannot be used on it, so you must get a pad.

Everything else is OK and I will consider staying again.

The housekeeper Amiee helped coordinate and adjusted the room type for us, but I don't know how the front desk handled it. We asked for a non-smoking room, but they were given to us. A moldy room with poor hygiene. Fortunately, the hotel front office manager Zhu Ludi helped coordinate and changed the room for us. The entire hotel was built relatively early, and the facilities are relatively old. The overall quality of the service staff still needs to be improved. (Including hotel doormen, hotel front desk, and restaurant service staff are basically smileless.) Compared with other cities of the same brand of Hilton. The best part is that the location is not bad, it is relatively close to the Youtiaozhou Yangtze River Bridge, Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, Yellow Crane Tower and Internet celebrity snack street.

Breakfast: It can only be said that it does not match Hilton. The breakfast noodles are salty and Wuhan's special snacks are not delicious. It is recommended not to have breakfast in the hotel. But the view at breakfast is pretty good.
The hotel is a bit old. It has been open for 7 or 8 years, so it feels old everywhere. The hygiene is very average. I can only say that it looks clean, but some details are forgotten.
In addition, the parking lot is really smelly, small and dark, and there are no charging points in the entire hotel. The nearest State Grid station takes 5 minutes to open.

The check-in butler is very cute, contact me in advance, and basically patiently help and solve my inquiries and needs. Therefore, it is recommended to friends who want to take a relaxing family tour.

I'm afraid it's not a fake Hilton! ! ! First of all, from entering the door to checking in, none of the hotel staff is willing to say a word to you. The whole process is indifferent. By the way, even the Wi-Fi password is told to me when I go back to the room and call the front desk. Work Poor efficiency and poor attitude. The river view is average, and the location is poor. As soon as you enter the door, you can see seepage walls and worn-out carpets that have been used for decades. The water pressure of the shower head can't wait to kill me. There are no children's toiletries. The most amazing thing is that the water delivered to more than 1,000 rooms is ice dew. The Hilton is five-star as the family said. I can't complain. Ctrip's good reviews are too exaggerated. It‚Äôs not as good as an express hotel. The overall feeling is dirty, chaotic, and indifferent. If you just want to see the river view, don‚Äôt come here. Compared with the warm, sweet and generous ladies at the front desk of the hotel I stayed in a few days ago, the gap is too big

The manager of the hotel, Huang, was very enthusiastic and arranged a rich breakfast for our family of 4. The night view of the hotel is beautiful. We stayed consecutively. I stayed in Wuhan for 2 nights, I didn't stay enough in Wuhan, I hope I will come to Wuhan again if I have the opportunity, and I will continue to choose the World Trade Center Hilton, just like the slogan in the hotel elevator, if you live in the right place, you will be right.

msg:When I brought my children to travel in Wuhan, I chose this river-view room where you can see the Yingwuzhou Bridge and the Yellow Crane Tower at the same time, which is really worthy of the name. The swimming pool on the fifth floor is also a plus point for their house in my heart. The Yingwuzhou Bridge opposite is close in front of us. No matter how you take pictures here, you can get pictures. All the facilities and supplies in the room are also very comfortable to use, and the view is very wide, whether it is day or night, you can see the river very well. The a**osphere of the buffet on the third floor is particularly good. When the lights of the Yellow Crane Tower and Yingwuzhou Bridge are turned on at night, you can enjoy the night view while eating dinner. It is really comfortable. The service of the hotel is considerate, the attitude of the young lady at the front desk is also very good, and the service of the hotel manager Huang is also very considerate. Overall, it was a very good experience. Next time I come to Wuhan, I will choose to stay in this hotel first.

The nearby restaurants and supermarkets are also very convenient, just a few minutes away, and there are Chinese and foreign delicacies. Courier service is also convenient.
The hotel staff are well-trained, the front desk is quick to handle, and the cleaning staff on the 19th floor is also very enthusiastic. Every time I meet her, I greet her with a smile. The breakfast is relatively rich, and Western-style pastries, croissants and mini egg tarts are my favorites.
The water in the hotel's swimming pool is very clean, and the floor-to-ceiling windows of the swimming pool are facing the Yingwuzhou Bridge, with a very good view. The swimming pool is also equipped with a warm water pool, which is very pleasant after swimming.
It is a pleasant experience for a family trip to stay for three days, and it is highly recommended.

The room is relatively large, and the twin room has a bed of 1.35 meters. It is no problem to bring a baby to sleep, which is very good!
The hotel's breakfast environment is perfect, next to the Yingwuzhou Bridge, eating breakfast is a kind of visual enjoyment~ Of course, the swimming pool can also see the same scenery.
Disadvantages: The elevator is sometimes very slow and takes a long time to wait.
Special thanks to the exclusive butler Louis for his enthusiastic and thoughtful service. I will choose this hotel again next time I go to Wuhan.

msg:I booked two river view rooms. Due to a wrong finger, one was reserved for an executive floor and the other for a high-rise. When I went to the front desk, I was told that they could not be arranged on the same floor, and there was a difference of ten floors. I took three children to travel and stay, and I got used to being a family. I lived close enough to be able to drop by and take care of me. It was a big blow to my heart. Even though the front desk upgraded me to a suite, it could not make up for this defect. The service did not do its best to consider the guests and reserve a room. The front desk saw that they brought a child and added a free breakfast, which is worthy of praise. The hotel swimming pool is also one of the reasons why children like to swim and stay here. The river view is very beautiful, very suitable for taking pictures and checking in. The geographical advantage is irreplaceable. I applied for a late check-out, came back from a swim at noon, and wanted to go to another room to get fruit to eat, but I didn‚Äôt expect that since it had been taken away by the cleaning and checked out without notice, is the five-star hotel going to drive away the guests?

       A arrives at the hotel ahead of time, much earlier than the check-in time, but the room has already been prepared;
       Not only can B check in immediately, but the girl at the front desk also upgraded the room type, so suddenly he has a better view;
       Not long after C checked in, the hotel sent welcome fruit again;
       We can all consider the above D to be a routine operation, but the last surprise is absolutely unexpected. The manager Huang in the lobby found that there were three people staying in us, and took the initiative to call (because he didn't pay attention to the call during the period, he took the trouble to contact for a long time), but only to offer another breakfast for the next day.

       Although the room does not have the highlights of the new hotel in terms of hardware, the hotel's service fully demonstrates the management of the World Trade Center and Hilton's reputation. Especially under the leadership of the lobby manager Herry, the service provided by the entire team fully deserves the status of this hotel.
        Although I have never stepped on the thunder in Hilton, but this time I was particularly impressed, thank you üòä I will definitely choose you again when I come to Wuhan again...

Before the customer leaves, contact the customer in advance to inquire about the check-in experience, and provide a free breakfast service. In this way, if you are not satisfied, you can follow up and solve it in time. It is also easier to get forgiveness. I believe that such hard work will definitely be seen, hard work pays off!
The location of the hotel is very good, very close to the Yellow Crane Tower, Wansong Garden, Gude Temple, and the Provincial Museum, about 20 yuan by taxi. Within 10 minutes of the hotel navigation, there is the online celebrity restaurant Shrimp King, which has a 4.8-rated Australian beef hot pot in about 5 minutes. You can directly enjoy the Yingwuzhou Bridge when you dine at the Taohua Hall restaurant. There must be a pit in every tourist attraction. When you go to Wuhan University, don‚Äôt get in the car to pick up guests, you will be pitted until you vomit blood! ! ! I paid an additional 520 yuan to learn how to swim in the hotel. The children went from swimming beginners to basic freestyle swimming movements, which was very efficient. It turns out that teaching others skills does not need to be fierce. Gentleness can also achieve efficiency,

msg:I have been to Wuhan many times. Whether it is the Yangtze River Bridge or the Yingwuzhou Bridge, I always have a special love for the 11 cross-river bridges in Wuhan. Every time, I like to take a walk along the river to see the majesty of the bridge. with shock!
This time, I found a hotel with a superb river view in Wuhan. Why don‚Äôt you go to the riverside? As long as you live in it, the Yingwuzhou Bridge will be your home. [Laughing R] This hotel is Wuhan Shimao Hilton Hotel.

Service: Why do you mention service, because the manager here is really awesome. After comparing prices through various platforms of Ctrip, I booked a room without breakfast on Ctrip. During the check-in period, when the hotel manager Huang made a return visit, he learned that our hotel did not have breakfast, so he specially arranged breakfast. Very pleasantly surprised. The most touching thing was that the car to go home was after 17 o'clock in the afternoon, and the non-members could only check out at 12 o'clock in the noon. After that, Manager Huang helped us coordinate to check out at 16 o'clock. Thank you very much for the thoughtful service, I will come again for business trip next month just because of this service.
Environment: The environment of the whole hotel is very good, quiet amidst the hustle and bustle, whether it is the cafeteria, the gym, or the guest rooms and the executive lounge, all have a good view, sitting on a first-line river view, the Yingwuzhou Bridge is in front of you, the river The Yellow Crane Tower on the opposite side can also be clearly seen.
Recommend a few seats that can be very good in the same frame as the Yingwuzhou Bridge~ 1 hotel cafeteria, the 180-degree floor-to-ceiling glass windows are really super beautiful, here, the Yingwuzhou Bridge is right next to you, and you can eat dinner
The Kungfu is accidentally in the same frame as the bridge, which is awesome! Yingwuzhou Bridge
Seats on that side are more sought-after, so you need to go early or make an appoin**ent in advance! 2 The hotel swimming pool, to be honest, I was shocked the moment I entered. The bridge is just outside the window. Here you can take pictures of artistic silhouettes in the same frame as the bridge. , In addition, you can ask the staff to help you open the door to the terrace, and the bridge will be closer to you.
3 rooms, if you stay in the river view room, you can also see the bridge and the beautiful river view very well.

msg:Let me say good things first, 1) The scenery is good, the layout is OK, and they are all spacious, but the sink is too small. 2) In terms of satisfying the demands of the guests, they basically responded. Check out, views and floors are all arranged.
The bad thing is that the responsibility must be the responsibility of the operator and the responsibility of the salary system.
1) The service standard is very low. High-end service is moderate in distance, gentle and neither humble nor pushy, while medium service is meticulous, patient and proactive. But this hotel doesn't have any. When I dragged my luggage to the front desk, the service staff on the far left stared at the computer immediately when they saw someone coming, and neither greeted nor communicated. Well, let's go to the window next to it. The waiter fully demonstrated his knife-mouthed bean curd heart. If you say yes, your request will be resolved. Turning around to park, the parking coupon cannot be scanned for a long time, and they will not help to solve it, nor will they remind customers how to use it. Inexplicably, I paid the parking fee myself.
You are in the service industry, everything needs to be explored by myself, what should I ask you to serve. Is this Hilton's standard? 2) Let‚Äôs talk about hygiene, not to mention how the khaki tiles with white seams look like a farmhouse. Look at the materials on the wall. In photo 3, only the reflection of the white light ***** can be seen, and there are dots all over the wall. The blackness on the door of the indoor bathroom, the traces of various liquids on the elevator, and the oil on the buttons. After staying for two nights, no one cleaned up.

It may be that the operator's salary system cannot satisfy employees to provide higher-standard services, or it may be that the quality of the management team is not good enough, or that the supervision is not in place.

But overall, this store is the worst Hilton I have ever stayed in. no different from miscellaneous brands
not recommended at all

I also had an exclusive butler to contact. The beauty Aimee is really attentive. Knowing that we are traveling with the elderly and children this time, we specially reserved a relatively quiet room on a high floor in advance. From check-in to check-out, there is no dissatisfaction in the whole process. Compared with hotels in the downtown area, I personally prefer this kind of quieter resort hotel. The hotel is next to the Yingwuzhou Yangtze River Bridge. The room is very spacious, with large floor-to-ceiling windows, and the entire Yangtze River can be seen in the room. Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, Parrot The Zhou Yangtze River Bridge and even the Yellow Crane Tower on the other side of the river are very clear. Although it is not in the downtown area, the surrounding food is very convenient. This is too surprising. The Yingwuzhou Food Street, Shrimp King, Crab God, and Panpan BBQ are all available. There is also a Hema Fresh Food next to the hotel, where you can eat and drink completely. Don't worry. The hotel's breakfast is very rich, as well as Wuhan premature bean curd and hot dry noodles. The afternoon tea and dinner in the executive lounge are also remarkable, which is comparable to Qingdao Shangri-La, which I have always loved. The most important point is that the people of Wuhan are really enthusiastic. The express drivers, taxi drivers, hotel service staff, and the lady who cleans the room are all very enthusiastic. Thanks again to Aimee for helping us complete this wonderful trip to Wuhan. Hilton is the best choice for our next trip to Wuhan!

msg:I have stayed in many Hilton hotels, and my impression has always been that the landscape is good and the water is large. The Hilton Wuhan Shimao Hotel I stayed at this time is next to the Yingwuzhou Bridge. You can also see the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge and the Yellow Crane Tower from a distance. The location is excellent. On the day of check-in, Lily Xie Yali, the hotel's guest relations director, added my WeChat in advance, helped me determine a room with a corner bay window, and kindly helped me put the luggage stored on the first floor into the room.
The executive floor is located above the 18th floor, and the floor is relatively high. You can see the beautiful river view while lying on the bed. The executive lounge is on the 28th floor, with afternoon tea from 2:00 to 4:00 pm and happy dinner from 6:00 to 8:00 pm.
The room was large, the bed was comfortable, the murals were beautiful, and apart from a few marks on the carpet, the room was almost perfect. The sink and shower in the bathroom have a large amount of water, and the bathroom can play music from the TV.
Breakfast is in the restaurant on the 3rd floor, both Chinese and Western breakfasts are rich. There are many seats, and the view by the window is even more amazing.

The location of the hotel is superior, the environment is warm and high-end, clean and tidy, and the facilities are complete. The viewing effect in the main room is excellent. You can see the Yellow Crane Tower, the Yangtze River Bridge and the beautiful Yingwuzhou Bridge, whether it is day or night. It's very pleasant. There is a mysterious and colorful beauty at night, and a bright and expansive beauty during the day. Facing the rolling Yangtze River and the beautiful scenery along both sides of the river, it makes people feel relaxed and happy.

The male front desk clerk said that there is no room with a bathtub. The one with a bathtub will wait until after three thirty, and asked me if I could Well, I said no, twenty or thirty minutes later, another waitress checked in... It is extremely rare for the front desk staff to take the initiative to downgrade the room type for guests, and it is also rare for professional hotel groups to have this kind of personnel management situation. In fact, this male waiter can give suggestions to the hotel management, regardless of room type, all room types have a unified price, I don't know if the management will adopt it.

There are executive lounge benefits, the afternoon tea is average, and even a staff member is too busy. The light meal at night is more appetizing than the one on Saturday night.

The location of the hotel is relatively remote because it is near the river, but it is also relatively quiet. The traffic is still convenient.

Downstairs are the Hanyang River Beach and the Yingwuzhou Yangtze River Bridge. Just in time for the first snowfall in Wuhan this winter, the river and night views are invincible! . Be sure to book a river view room! I didn't book the first night. Thanks to manager Herry huang for a free upgrade to a river view room for the next two nights. It's perfect! üåπ

The sun rises in the morning and shines on the river, sparkling and full of vitality. Foggy days are another kind of hazy beauty. The hotel's service is very good. Lily, the customer service manager, often asks questions and responds promptly if she needs anything. She is very thoughtful and considerate. Seeing that I lived with my child for several days, I specially applied for breakfast for Xiaonian, thank you.

The scenery is nothing to say, and you can watch the sunrise when you get up early, which is so beautiful.

Large floor-to-ceiling windows, you can see the Yangtze River from the bed in the room, very comfortable.

msg:Ever since I decided to go out for New Year's Eve, I have been thinking of choosing a river view hotel to reward myself for working so hard in 2022. As a hotel manager, I have very special requirements for hotels. I have always chosen Hilton among the high-end hotels. My favorites are Yingwuzhou, Hanyang River Beach, Crab God, Hema, Sitong Hankou, and the central area of Wuchang. The high-quality location is convenient and saves a lot of space for fun. After arriving at nine o'clock, the concierge depar**ent warmly greeted and guided me to the hotel check-in front desk from the moment I entered the door. The polite and clear explanation of check-in improved my first image of this hotel. After entering the room, you can see the Hanyang River Beach in the distance. The clean room with a wide view is very satisfying. The fly in the oin**ent is that there is no ventilation button in the bathroom and bathroom, and the privacy is not very good when the light is turned on. The background light of the sink is only warm and cannot be adjusted to white light. There will be a big contrast between indoor and outdoor after makeup. I personally suggest that the hotel can make some adjus**ents. After a short rest, we went to the New Year‚Äôs Eve. When we came back, we thought there were no parking spaces. Unexpectedly, there were quite a lot of them. I ordered takeaway when I was a little hungry. Masks The reason is that the takeaway guy can‚Äôt deliver it to my door. I need to go downstairs to the lobby to get it. I‚Äôm really tired and don‚Äôt want to move, so I call the front desk and ask the waiter to bring it up. The lady at the front desk is very patient and gentle to help me solve it. Come up, it should be from the concierge depar**ent, so handsome, so handsome, when the tall black coat was politely given to me, I felt a heartbeat instantly hahaha, the two takeaways were given by that handsome guy, my friend said before The waiter who delivered the ice bucket was also very handsome. I felt like we made a lot of money this night hahaha. We started to get irritable after we were infatuated. The panorama is really good and the a**osphere gets up after a while. You must live in a river view room, it‚Äôs super satisfying what you want After one night, the morning breakfast is 8:30-10:00. We got up early and went to the restaurant on the third floor. Unexpectedly, there were already many people eating. The breakfast content is very rich, both Chinese and Western, and you can see the Yangtze River Bridge I already have a panoramic view of the Yingwuzhou Yangtze River Bridge~ The service is also very good. It would be great if the tableware was paired with a fork. Fruits are really not suitable for spoons and chopsticks. I also forgot to ask the waiter for it. Hilton Hotel gave me a great experience ~ Happy New Year everyone

The mineral water in the room is cheap and the service manager changed it for us. The TV in the room is as small as it looks. More than ten years ago, I forgot all of these things. If the light in the bathroom was broken at 12:00 in the middle of the night, the maintenance personnel came to replace the room, then I think the hotel did not clean the room at all to check the quality of the facilities in the house. I live in a room close to 1,000 Makes me feel like I can't stand a facility like this

       But your doorman and food delivery staff have "a lot of room for improvement." On the first day, the doorman took the initiative to take my luggage and send me to the front desk and find a staff to connect me.

I just came to Wuhan to go to university. I didn‚Äôt live in many hotels in Wuhan. Compare Optics Valley Hyatt with you horizontally. I have a foot injury and am in a wheelchair to and from the hospital and hotel every day. The security guy pushes me in and out of the hotel every day and helps me get on and off the car.
        Your food delivery staff is also very "noble" oh my room floor magnet is broken and the door will close by itself I see that it is inconvenient for your food delivery staff to carry a large plate in and out, so I stand by the door and help him block the door to deliver food I didn't say "thank you" when I received the food. I don't know if it's normal for your hotel. I've stayed in so many hotels. Anyway, it's the first time I have encountered such a situation. Don't say anything about whether it meets the "five-star" This is the service standard of a first-class hotel. This is the lack of personal quality of your food delivery staff. Don't let it on the guests. It's really speechless.
        Service is an important soft power of a five-star hotel. Your hotel still has a lot of room for improvement.

On the day of check-in, Lily, the customer service, asked about the check-in experience. I expressed that everything else was good, but the only connection room was arranged. It was already night, and the customer service quickly helped us change rooms, and the view was even better. We could clearly see the Yangtze River Bridge and the Parrot Island Bridge.

The crispy pastries such as coffee and croissants in the buffet breakfast are very decent, and I have never eaten such delicious food in other five-star hotels.
It's a pity that the pool water is muddy when swimming, which is a little bit bad for a five-star hotel. There are still many people who teach swimming. I wonder if this is only the case on Saturdays and Sundays?

This book is nothing, I have used Ctrip for more than ten years and have not received any words. 2. In order to save time, we took a room first, and we went out after taking a rest. Called several times in the afternoon, on the ninth floor, on the tenth floor, and finally determined the room. When I went back at night, it was a room with a smell. I wanted to hold on to it for a while, but the shower room leaked again. The hotel asked the master to repair it to ask us where there was a problem, giving people the feeling that they didn't want to deal with it. Can the room be handed over to the client even if it does not meet the conditions? The manager responded quickly and helped us change rooms. 3. There was a wedding banquet in the hotel the next day. The poor single-aisle entry and exit site at the entrance was full of water, and there was no guide or notification at the intersection. When I drove to the venue, I fell down. Well, I parked in the underground garage, but it turned out that I was pointing in the wrong direction. It is difficult to scan the license plate at the entrance. It is estimated that there are many cars in the same situation as me. It is easy to turn the position, and my car was scratched during the period. Of course, this is my own problem. 4. On the day I left the store, my wife and children were woken up by the smell of smoke. Really big smell of smoke. In conclusion, a decent business hotel. Not suitable for family driving

Entering the room, the layout of the room is very warm, the cleaning is clean and tidy, the bed is very flat and beautiful, and it is also equipped with a memory pillow, it is very comfortable to sleep, especially thanks to Hu Rong, the room manager, we don&#39;t know how to use an iron, and he is very patient to teach us how Use, help us iron! Breakfast the next morning, the western restaurant is on the third floor of the hotel, and the variety is rich and delicious!

The location is very convenient, a taxi is basically 10 yuan, and the driver will take the order quickly.
Needless to say, the old five-star hotel has a very good service attitude from the hotel staff.
I learned that the river view room could not be upgraded because the Wuyi room was full, but the little brother at the front desk tried his best to satisfy us and arranged a room with a little river view on the upper floor for us, and the DM also gave us breakfast.
Very satisfied with the service attitude of the hotel staff!!

There is a big Sacred Armor on the beach opposite the hotel, I recommend everyone to eat!!!!
You can also order takeout at the Fatty Shrimp Restaurant, delicious!!!

Originally, a few days later in Wuhan, I ordered Westin to watch the river view, but I was kept by Fairmont's food hahaha. The Hilton has a side river view, so it's better to see the Parrot Island Bridge in the place for breakfast. The room I was in was facing the Yellow Crane Tower, but when I was at the Hilton, it was raining all the time in Wuhan, and it was a pity that I didn't take pictures, and the glass would look dirty when I took a close-up shot outside the window. Because I was not sure what the view of the room was, I booked a normal room type the next day. I originally planned to upgrade at my own expense the next day, but I couldn't get the room card in the executive lounge on the first day. floor. Later, the hotel explained that the executive floor was re-divided this year, and Huang Rui, the lobby manager, gave a free upgrade of the room type to apologize and make up for the service experience, and praised the service! ! The only downside of the hotel is that the food and beverages are really unsatisfactory. You must go to the executive lounge early for dinner, otherwise there will be nothing to eat. Afternoon tea is too perfunctory üòÇ The breakfast is quite good~ I hope to be more careful about the food and beverages, and the executive Miss Yu Zhuo in the lounge is very nice! !

Also, I think this hotel with carpeted rooms is actually the dirtiest. In order to save costs, how often can the hotel be cleaned and disinfected? Are you careful? It's very cold with the heater on in the house at night, the toiletries provided in the bathroom are also inferior, and the body wash is not enough to wash the upper body, that's all! Dry and itchy after use. I think it is not as good as Jiji Hotel. Jiji Hotel has electric curtains. The style and decoration are modern and simple. The room is very clean. There is a refrigerator in the room. This is my first stay at the World Trade Hilton Hotel in Wuhan, and my last time!

On the day of check-in, due to the full schedule, before arriving at the hotel at 6 o'clock in the evening, Wang Zhiqi, the guest experience ambassador, called to inquire about the situation, who was gentle and meticulous. First of all, he helped me upgrade the room type, from the river view room to the high-rise river view room, and also sent breakfast (to dispel my premature thoughts), and sent welcome fruits. The deposit of 500 is really cheap üòÑ
Although the air conditioner is a bit weak, I don't know why the room temperature is very warm. It has been turned on for 16 degrees and the room temperature is still 27. Later, the air conditioner is turned off and it is not cold.
Overall, I am still very satisfied. If you have the opportunity to come back to Wuhan, you must choose Hilton!

The breakfast was not served and warm. I changed hotels for six days without seeing any changes in the restaurant I didn't have too much language. After I finished my meal, I called and said that I would take it away as soon as possible. I didn't ask if my dining experience was very fast. I went out for breakfast in the morning and there was an executive lounge at the door. Jessica Carey was very good. The happy hour food in the hall is wide, but the taste is really bad. The desserts are not delicious and the food is not good. The duck is so unpalatable. The service in the executive lounge for two consecutive days can add chicken legs to them. Without them, the hotel would not be able to talk about service. The concierge service is still not good. I need an itinerary code. The hotel has a good location. The river view is very beautiful. There are two subway stations in the surrounding area. In short, the service of the room was deducted from the executive lounge. It was the breakfast and the swimming pool. I left the hotel without asking me how to check in. Wuhan Hilton left a bad impression on me. Thank you for upgrading my room, but it was still successful in persuading me. back me

1. The hotel equipment is old and the sockets are loose, which is too unsafe. The wallpaper in the room was falling off and the carpet was dirty. These slippers are also the thinnest slippers I have ever seen at Hilton, and they are rough and silky after wearing them a few times.
2. The hotel's breakfast is really bad. It's the worst breakfast in so many Hiltons. There are very few kinds of things. The watermelon turned out to be overnight, and the orange was not enough. When I entered the restaurant, there was no waiter to guide me, so I asked specifically, why don't you just sit by yourself? The normal standard is to guide the waiter and then ask what to drink. The occupancy rate was not high last night, even this standard is not really too bad. The waiters were still standing and chatting, chatting all the time.
3. Because a friend asked the hotel for a match for his birthday, the front desk said no. Then there was a call to the switchboard, and the attitude was really bad. All kinds of shirk, but also shirk to the sales side. Is the match with the logo of the Hilton I used to be fake?
A really disappointing stay.

The orange-red Parrot Island Yangtze River Bridge is close at hand, across the river facing the Yellow Crane Tower, the Yangtze River Bridge in the distance and the light show at Wuchang are also clearly visible. You can enjoy the day and night river view without being too dazzling by the light show LED.

The breakfast has Wuhan characteristics and the view is invincible. The sesame sauce of the hot dried noodles is full, but it is recommended that they can be paired with capers for more authenticity. But Wuhan bean curd and egg fried rice don't know if it has been baked for too long. It has been dried out by the light, so it is recommended to improve it.

Because I have previously noted the hope for the high-level + river view, a room on the 19th floor was specially arranged. The staff's overall sense of service is very good. Thank you for the coordination of the front desk, the concierge, and the lobby manager Huang Rui for your meticulous care. A very pleasant staying experience. Will recommend staying next time~

msg:The location of the hotel is in a large residential area with relatively few commercial facilities. In the morning, I didn't even find a suitable place to eat breakfast, stay in the hotel to eat the buffet (but it's not expensive). The so-called high-rise rooms are only given up to about 16, if you need it, please go directly to the administrative floor. Recently, the landscape lighting has not been turned on, and the river view at night will be affected. Some of the design details of the bathroom fixtures are terrible, such as basins and bathtubs that have to reach for dirty water to let the water go, and a towel rack sticks out of the basin, which can only be used by leaning forward. Driving here was a poor experience. I was clearly guided to a dead end by the markings along the way. I drove down to the ba*****t and refused to let in. Then I reversed all the way and went back to the ba*****t entrance on the other end. Watch the play at the door.

üçú Food: The breakfast is very rich. It is said to end at 10 o'clock, but it will be delayed until 10.30. It can be said that it is very humane. There is a children's playground in the breakfast restaurant, which is very suitable for storing children. After staying in Wuhan for two days, I checked in several online red dots, and finally one of them agreed that the hot dry noodles are still delicious in the Hilton breakfast. The things in the executive lounge are also better than westin.

The desk in the room is still rotten, the bed by the bathtub, the sheets are okay, but the bedding smells like someone else's body, which is extremely disgusting!
Breakfast is ordinary, and there is free white wine for dinner. Although it is not too expensive, you can drink freely on the Yangtze River Bridge!

msg:The location of the hotel is unique, and you can see the beautiful view of the Parrot Chau Bridge from the window. The rooms are clean and good, swimming and fitness are convenient, and the characteristics of a five-star hotel are still available. As far as personal experience is concerned, the breakfast is not amazing, three-star standard. Especially during the holidays, the passenger flow is not good. I missed the holiday on the last day. I feel that the dining environment is acceptable. There is still a lot of room for improvement in Western food, especially the coffee. The lobby manager Huang Rui‚Äôs after-sales follow-up is more thoughtful, and I will consider staying next time

The check-in was a bit slow and it was a bit uncomfortable, but the front desk explained that there are many people during the holiday, and I understand that the hotel is well located, the breakfast is rich and there is a children‚Äôs amu*****t park, suitable for playing with the baby

msg:When I first came to Wuhan, I chose the Hilton Hotel. The overall service of the hotel is good. The lady at the front desk satisfies our desire to see the river view and adjusted the city view room to the river view room. Although it is a half-window, I am still very happy to see the beauty. Night viewüåÉ. In addition, the shower head of our room 1202 is broken. Once opened, spray on it and forgot to feed it back to the hotel. Please repair it as soon as possible. We also hope that the maintenance depar**ent can check and confirm it regularly.

msg:Maybe it‚Äôs because there are a lot of people living in the hotel. It takes a long time to line up after 3 o‚Äôclock to check in. After entering the room, there is a piece of rubbish in the middle of the curtains. Maybe it‚Äôs because of the sun. A lot of stuffy things.... In fact, the mood is very unpleasant at once! The scenery outside the window is great.......
