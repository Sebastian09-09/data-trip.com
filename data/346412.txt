msg:Subject: Urgent Complaint Regarding Damaged Hermès Birkin Bag

Dear Ritz-Carlton Pudong Management,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to express my extreme dissatisfaction with the service I received during my recent stay at your hotel from May 29 to May 30, 2024, in room 4323.

Upon checking out, I entrusted my luggage, including an Hermès Birkin 35 bag, to your porters while I went shopping. When I later retrieved my luggage and proceeded to the airport, I discovered once I was on the plane that my Hermès Birkin bag had been damaged. Specifically, there are two large black ink marks on the back of the bag. It appears that one of your employees caused these marks during the time they were responsible for my belongings.

This situation is unacceptable. I explicitly asked the porter who collected my luggage from the room to be careful with my Hermès bag as it is fragile. He assured me that he understood and would handle it with care. However, the resulting damage indicates a clear disregard for my instructions and the high standard of service I expected from a hotel of your reputation.

I am meticulous with my belongings and do not use pens, let alone carry them in my Hermès bag. The ink stains are permanent and irreparable, as I was informed when I purchased the bag. Additionally, the bag was in pristine condition upon my arrival at your hotel, throughout my stay, and at the time of checkout. Given that I used a luxury private chauffeur service to the airport and had the bag in my possession during the journey, it is evident that the damage occurred while the bag was in the hotel's custody.

I am deeply disappointed by the negligent service and have lost all confidence in your establishment. I have since returned to Paris and will consult with Hermès to explore any possible solutions, although I am not hopeful. The damaged Hermès Birkin 35 bag was a custom-made order, designed to my specifications, which took two years to receive. I have owned it for three years and maintained it in excellent condition.

Furthermore, I will be sharing this unfortunate experience with my network to caution them about the risks of staying at your hotel. Based on this incident, I will not recommend the Ritz-Carlton, nor any other Marriott properties, to anyone.

I am attaching photos of the damaged bag for your reference. Please be aware that I am considering legal action to seek compensation for the damage incurred.

Sincerely,
Constantin Ciorba

The room was comfortable and spacious. We didn’t use the tub, but wow!! The hotel is connected to the ifc Mall and subway. So it is super convenient!
We would definitely stay here again.

msg:￼ When it’s time for me to take a well-deserved  break from the stressors of my life, I head to the Ritz Carlton Shanghai IFC.  I experienced the 49th floor Club level.  I will definitely return.  My room had my preferred view of the Oriental Pearl (TV) Tower.  ￼ I’m originally from the Mississippi Gulf Coast, so watching the barges on the river brings me peace.  And when it’s time for the nightly light show at 7 PM sharp, my inner child is giddy every time.  It’s the little touches that means so much, the beautiful fruit and flowers next to the macaroons upon arrival to my art deco chic hideaway makes an old Girl feel special. In-room dining is so amazing with their delicious offerings of comfort food like perfect mashed potatoes or spaghetti.  Each Gentleman and Lady provided polite service with warmth!  Thank you!  Breakfast was wonderful at the Club!  Fabulous Manager in the making, Beyond, greeted me with a welcome smile and relaxed demeanor that made me feel very valued!  He chatted and checked on me as I leisurely made my way through both Chinese and Western breakfast items: I had the most tasty bowl of dumplings (perfect broth), an incredible serving of Chinese spinach (or was it something else) it was deliciously tender and tangy topped with Asian pickles-that is how I eat greens in the US: homesickness alleviated.  Get your Western style breakfast happiness: eggs - made to order, fresh, squeezed orange juice, toast, sausages, and exceptional baby potatoes.  I will return to the Club level so that I can try them more offerings and thank the Ladies that graciously kept the black coffee, fresh, squeezed orange juice and club soda coming.  Because my room was￼ on the same floor as the breakfast club my walk back to my fluffy bed and a glorious nap was not a long one.  As a successful insomniac I can happily say that while I am at the Ritz Carlton IFC, I am unsuccessful. I always get the best sleep while ￼I am visiting.  I will be returning to The Ritz for more warm elegance soon!

msg:Shanghai has been a city that I always travel to at least twice a year for as long as I remember, with that I have stayed at most of luxury hotels in this city. I can confidently say the Pudong Ritz-Carlton is one of the top. The service was amazing and definitely the star of the show. I came early and was awkwardly waiting in the lobby for my room, while waiting Vicky approached me to ask if I needed anything and then proceed to work with Ashin to get my room, a little after my room was just ready. So special thanks to the lobby people of Vicky and Ashin for the great service and help. 

The room was great - clean, large, elegant, with a lot of button controls. The facilities are pretty good, the gym has all the equipment you need and the pool is great - however the pool may be a little crowded later in the night. 

Mentioning service again, in my room I had a visit form a person bringing fruit as a welcome and also a gelato cart randomly showed up which I thought was amazing and hilarious, free ice cream anyone? Also I saw around noon to early afternoon check out rush hour the hotel brought a clown in for the kids, the guy made Ballons and stuff to entertain the lobby kids which could get a little rowdy sometimes, so that was great - the ice cream cart ended up in the lobby too. Little attention to details like that show that the hotel really care about its guests.

Another perk is the great views, from the hotel you can essentially see the whole puxi district of shanghai from south to north bund, the views are all around even in the gym. Also breakfast views were great. 

I will definitely come back when I get the chance, and thank you to Vicky and Ashin for all the care, even during rush hour where things may get a little hectic.

The room was brilliant (we had a Pearl Tower view), the breakfast was delicious and everyone really went above and beyond to make sure that we had a great time (Charles on reception and Brian at the downstairs lobby were particularly helpful). A big special thanks to both Chelsea and Saveliy for putting together a small birthday display in our room - they even included a desert, a hand written card and a small gift. Such a lovely personal touch and it really made our stay just that extra bit special. I would definitely recommend staying here for a special occasion or even just as a mid-week treat, we had a great time and look forward to hopefully coming back in the future!

We stayed in a Pearl Tower view room that took our breath away. We spent the afternoon in the pool followed by massages and facials at the spa. The club lounge was lovely and we enjoyed afternoon tea and evening cocktails with a gorgeous view of the bund. I truly can’t wait for my next stay.

msg:I have been to Shanghai so many times. The first time was not for work, but as a tourist. Of course, I had to be the most "unfashionable" tourist and choose to live in the iconic Shanghai Bund. I basically looked at all the hotels near the Bund on Ctrip. After comprehensive consideration, I chose the Ritz-Carlton. Sure enough, the location is excellent, with a great view of the Oriental Pearl Tower and the Waibaidu Bridge. I also want to thank the hotel and the housekeeper Jessie for their thoughtful decoration of the room, which is very lively. The breakfast is rich and delicious. Next time I come to Shanghai, I will choose Li Zi again~🥰

He said I should go to the kitchen to check, and he really brought it. I was really touched😹. The service attitude was so good😊. In short, except for the low shower flow, everything was good👍.

msg:The hotel is in a very good location, right above IFC and opposite the Oriental Pearl Tower! Violet, the front desk manager, was very kind. Seeing that we had children traveling with us, she immediately opened another check-in counter to help us.
When we returned to the hotel in the evening, Ms. Nicole took us back to the room and introduced the equipment in the room. After entering the room, we found that our luggage had been delivered, and we bought bed rails and children's supplies for the children. Violet prepared several extra bottles of water for us and gave us fruits for the cake🍰
What surprised us the most was that the Chinese team sent us a greeting card, which said they welcomed us back to Shanghai after 14 years. This was exactly the conversation we had with Violet in the morning! We were very moved and felt like we were home!
The night view of the Bund from the room is very beautiful! It turns out that you can see the Oriental Pearl Tower at the end of the window. I am very grateful to Violet for the arrangement!
When we checked out the next day, the hotel even gave us a customized key card for our family of three, which was very memorable!
Thank you again Violet for your thoughtful arrangement! Kind reception from Nicole! And help from housekeeper sister Vicky! I will definitely stay here again next time I come to Shanghai!

msg:The hotel is in a very good location. It should be the closest luxury hotel to the Oriental Pearl Tower. The overall style of the hotel did not leave a deep impression on me. It is just a generally luxurious decoration. There are many other entertainment venues in the whole building. It is probably quite fun, but I did not go. As for the room, I arrived late and the Oriental Pearl Tower had turned off the lights. When I first entered, I was confused about the Oriental Pearl Tower river view room. After confirming with the manager, I found that the Oriental Pearl Tower was right in front of me. Hahaha anyway, the room facilities are relatively old but complete. There are many mirrors, which makes it a bit scary to be alone at night. Overall, it is okay, but not as good as expected.

The only drawback is that the weather is not very good. There is a lot of fog. But the room arrangement is actually very good. The service staff is very enthusiastic.

As soon as the car stopped, he immediately opened the door and helped to push the luggage to the lobby on the first floor. The lady had already opened the elevator door and waited for you to go in. Because the check-in is on the 52nd floor, the luggage was directly placed in the room after the check-in. The check-in was super fast. The lady smiled and served throughout the whole process. It was super warm. After checking in, the beautiful lady Jessi guided us to the room on the 45th floor and told us that we could customize a Ritz-Carlton room card for the children. We customized the Oriental Pearl Tower pattern and the children's name. It was facing the Oriental Pearl Tower. The night view was super beautiful. Thank you very much to Miss Jessi and the waiter for first-class service. I will continue to stay next time I come to Shanghai

msg:The Ritz-Carlton Hotel is located in the core area of ​​Lujiazui, Shanghai, across the street from the Oriental Pearl TV Tower. It is surrounded by skyscrapers and has a great view. The first floor of the hotel is directly connected to the IFC supermarket, which is convenient for guests to shop, dine and relax. The room where my family and I stayed was right on the Bund, with pleasant scenery, comfortable bedding, high-end bathroom facilities, and beautiful and exquisite decoration in the room. (Pictures 1 to 6) The breakfast in the hotel's executive corridor is fresh and delicious, providing a variety of Chinese, Western, Japanese and other meals (Figure 7 is part of the breakfast), with rich choices. The Scena di Angelo Italian restaurant on the 52nd floor of the hotel has authentic food, and the view position can enjoy the majestic beauty of the Oriental Pearl Tower (Picture 8).

Special thanks to the staff Jessi. Jessi is a very lovely and considerate sister who provided us with sincere and thoughtful service very attentively. For example, Jessi came in her busy schedule to take a photo with me and my friend who was catching a flight (Figure 9); helped me book the best view seat at the Jinxuan Chinese Restaurant on the 53rd floor of the hotel (Figures 10 and 11); and gave me a small doll as a souvenir when I checked out (Figure 12). There are countless examples like this. Jessi's series of care touched us, and her outstanding service deserves recognition and rewards. I wish her good work and academic success!

In short, I sincerely recommend everyone to stay at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel, where you will definitely have a home-like time. I can't wait to stay again!

msg:This time I want to give a good and objective evaluation.
First of all, praise: the service is as good as ever. This is the second time I have chosen the Ritz suite this month. The doorman is very polite, and the lobby staff will also ask, guide and help press the elevator, which is worthy of praise. The room view is good, all excellent.
However, several things happened during this stay, which was almost unbearable for me.
I arrived at the hotel at 1:48 and was told that the room was not ready. I understood, so we went to eat. My wife returned to the lobby at 3:15 to wait for the notice that it was still not cleaned up, so I went to get a suit, a few bags, and a suit. I didn't come back until 4 o'clock. During this time, my wife could only take her carry-on bag and go directly to the Oriental Pearl Tower without checking in. Because there was no room... no clothes, no makeup, Shanghai happened to be cold, and I almost caught a cold. Because I didn't wear contact lenses, I went out to get the suit like a ** all afternoon. After contacting Ctrip, I was notified that the room was cleaned up at 4 o'clock.
Then... Picture 2, after cleaning for so long, I found false eyelashes left by the previous guest on the washstand in the bathroom... My wife hasn't checked in yet... It's impossible that I left them... The old man who does the cleaning is hard-working, so I chose to remind the front desk the next day and ignore it.
There is another thing I want to criticize twice, such a big hotel, there is no smoking area, Shanghai has regulations that smoking is not allowed indoors, I abide by it, but the hotel is next to the Guojin. I was smoking outside the lobby door, but was driven away by the doorman. I moved to the right side of the HSBC Bank... I was blocked by outdoor decoration... I went to the left side of the IFC to smoke, but was driven away by the IFC staff... If I wanted to smoke, I had to walk through the parking lot and go around to the side of the IFC to smoke... I have been to Shanghai countless times and stayed in all five-star hotels... I have never had this experience...
And the room card, I went through the two-day procedures when I checked in, and the next day at noon after shopping at the IFC... I arrived at the door of the room with a lot of bags and found that the card could not be swiped. My wife was standing at the door with five or six bags of things, and I went back to the 52nd floor to make a new room card... The lobby staff actually asked me to wait in line... Then I strongly told them that I was a checked-in guest, and it was your work error that prevented me from entering the room, and my wife was standing at the door with several bags of luggage, and chose to go to the back to make it for me... As a result... there was still only one room card that could be used... I could only go to the front desk again at night when there were fewer people...
I don't like to give low scores, nor do I like to slander. I hope that the hotel public relations depar**ent can report to the leadership and pay attention to it.

1 The location is invincible. If you want to see the Oriental Pearl Tower, the three-piece suite, or the Pudong Art Museum, the Aurora Museum, etc., you don’t need to go out by train, just walk for more than ten minutes. You can enjoy the dazzling night view sitting in the house at night.
2 Complete facilities. Although the Shangri-La is in a good location, the indoor facilities are a generation behind here. In addition, the skyline swimming pool and the top bar are not only hardware-sounding, but also software-sounding.
3 Ritz’s service doesn’t need to be said again, but it’s said again. The service has already started before the departure. The hotel will take the initiative to call to inquire about the arrival time and service requirements. I just mentioned that the child’s birthday was just a casual mention, and the table reserved in the evening was thoughtfully made into a happy birthday sign. It is worthy of Miss Coco’s favorite (there is a Chanel store downstairs).

msg:This time I came to the Ritz and had a really extraordinary experience. Helen had already started serving us before I even checked into the lounge! She was a very warm and lovely lady! She also took care of us meticulously during our stay. The lounge gave me a perfect feeling! Beyond the care of the manager, Yoyo also decorated the room for us! Crane and Summer's enthusiastic service! Jerry and Ethan's timely response made me feel that choosing the lounge was a very wise decision! I will come again next time! [玫瑰][玫瑰]

The view was really great! And the service is great, especially Jennie! Next time I go to Shanghai, I will consider staying at the Ritz-Carlton.

msg:Yesterday I stayed at The Ritz-Carlton, Pudong, Shanghai, and I would like to share my stay experience. First of all, I must marvel at the luxurious a**osphere and impressive service of this hotel. However, what sticks with me the most is their amazing GR team.
​
When I arrived at the hotel, I immediately felt Ashin's enthusiasm and professionalism. Not only did she help me check in quickly, she also kindly asked about my needs and preferences. The personalized service provided by the hotel made me feel at home, and I truly realized the "guest first" service concept. Whether it was answering my questions or providing thoughtful advice, they always showed unparalleled patience and meticulousness. Especially when we returned to the room and found that Ashin and Bessie had already prepared a birthday surprise for us, we were really touched.
​
And during my stay, the lounge team led by Beyond manager also left a deep impression on me. Entering the lounge, I was infected by their warm smiles and attentive service. Throughout the afternoon tea time, the lounge team always maintained a high level of service quality, allowing guests to feel truly distinguished trea**ent.
​
Overall, my stay at The Ritz-Carlton, Pudong, Shanghai completely exceeded my expectations, and this is mainly due to their GR team and lounge team, which are well led. Here, I not only enjoyed luxurious and comfortable accommodation, but also experienced truly considerate service. I am very satisfied with my stay and look forward to visiting again in the future to continue to enjoy their warm hospitality and unparalleled service

msg:This is the first time for me and my children to come to Shanghai. My husband has been here before. Since we only stayed for one day and had to return, my husband suggested staying near the Bund. We chose the Ritz-Carlton, Pudong, Shanghai. I am very happy and spent a pleasant day here.
We chose the Pearl Bund Suite and lived on the 43rd floor. The view of the room is invincible. The Huangpu River, the Oriental Pearl Tower, and the International Buildings are right in front of us. Needless to say, the hardware facilities of the hotel are also very good. The meal in the executive lounge is also delicious, and the two children like it very much. The most worth mentioning is that all the service staff of the hotel are very service-minded, communicating in soft voices, smiling at any time, and making people feel happy. Especially my housekeeper summer and the front desk beauty fay, both helped us with our trip this time. Since we arrived at the hotel at 12 o'clock, summer coordinated in advance to let us check in early to facilitate our subsequent trip. Fay knew our return time and took the initiative to suggest delaying check-out for one hour. Thank them for making our short trip to Shanghai more complete. Next time I come to Shanghai, I will continue to choose here.

I am very touched. Not only did it give me a birthday gift He also sent me a greeting card and a birthday cake. The most surprising thing was that Angie specially prepared flowers for me🌸. I was really in tears. Beyond in the executive lounge recognized me for the first time when I went there. I was really touched and valued. It feels really good, and the service from the handsome guy Jerry is also very good. He gave me a little duck. Overall, it’s 100 points, perfect.

I chose the Ritz-Carlton Hotel because it was my birthday. I originally just called to ask if I could stay on a high floor, but when I heard it was my birthday, they were ready to decorate the room for me, including a small cake and a handwritten greeting card. It was really thoughtful~
When I checked in, the two front desk ladies wished me a happy birthday, full of ritual. I got up at 7 o'clock in the morning, changed into a small dress and took a lot of photos. The Oriental Pearl Tower and the Huangpu River are in full view, and with the decoration and birthday cake, it looks very beautiful no matter how you take it.
Finally, thank Vivian, Lily, and Vicky for making my birthday very memorable~

As far as the eye can see, the scenery on both sides of the river can be enjoyed. The eyes show the Shanghai style at different moments, and the room service strives for excellence. Whether it is the inadvertently given chocolate snacks or the speed of luggage and online ordering, it is amazing. I spent a leisurely travel time with him.

msg:This time I came to the Ritz-Carlton Shanghai Pudong and chose to stay in a suite room. The view is super wide, and you can have a panoramic view of the beautiful scenery across the Huangpu River.

The hardware facilities in the room are first-class. Although they are a little old, they are very well maintained. The check-in experience was very good. The lady at the front desk was very helpful and smooth from check-in to check-out.

The bar on the top floor is a good place to hang out, but it was quite foggy on the day I went there, so it wasn’t very scenic. As for the quality of drinks and meals, the price/performance ratio is not high. The Chinese restaurant is average, the barbecued pork tastes good, but the fried rice is a bit too oily. On the contrary, the pastries provided were surprisingly delicious.

The swimming pool is not big but the view is very nice and the gym facilities are relatively complete. The breakfast is very good, and the all-buffet dishes are also very exquisite. I will try the executive lounge level next time I have the opportunity.

In addition, there are some things that I am not particularly satisfied with. For example, as soon as I entered the room, I felt a smell that had not been ventilated for a long time. The welcome gift was also relatively simple. I hope I can have a better experience next time. Friends are traveling.

Facilities: Five -star hotels should have all. Dyson's hair dryer in the room is very powerful and saves himself. TOTO smart toilet 家 is high -end than home.
Hygiene: I didn't pick anything.
Service: One day before travel, the hotel took the initiative to call to confirm the itinerary. Gloria sent greetings and asked our needs in advance. On the day of staying, CHECK IN, Miss SARA laughed at each other, took the initiative to accompany us until the guest room, only the words praised her husband to keep his mouth, and did not forget to send the exquisite custom room card. During the buffet breakfast, her husband sat in front of the table with a rich deliciousness, and the handsome restaurant's handsome guy immediately handed the tableware, and the husband realized that he had forgotten the spoon. (Compared to Yalong Bay Ritz buffet breakfast slightly better)
In short, these details of this hotel have left me a deep impression on me! Thank you for your return visit and small gifts! I will choose you again next time you travel!

The view from the room is very good. It is very close to the Bund and the Oriental Pearl Tower. You can see both. When visiting the hotel, the staff also enthusiastically recommended it. I will choose Pudong Ritz next time I come back! ! !

msg:This hotel stay experience can be described as amazing. Arranged by the hotel manager Ashin, the family felt that the Ritz's service was first-class, and the room was nothing special. It was eye-level with the Oriental Pearl Tower and overlooked the entire Pudong. I was shocked and felt that I made the right choice. Especially the night view left a deep memory. The package is very reasonable, including breakfast for three people, setting up a tent, eating snacks, and private swimming lessons for the children in the morning. The coach did his duty and allowed the child to learn a new freestyle style. Let’s have a great time and eat as much as we can during this trip to Shanghai. Looking forward to coming again next time.

Overall experience: The rooms on the executive floor are comfortable and large enough, and the executive lounge has rich benefits, including three meals a day until 11:00 pm. The price-performance ratio is extremely high, and the environment is beautiful. At night, the lanterns of all the buildings on the Bund are lit up, and the executive lounge has a panoramic view.

The hotel is right next to the International Financial Center, which is very convenient and has complete facilities and equipment. The hotel service is very meticulous. Every Ritz staff member we met was enthusiastic, proactive and patient. For example, they called us the day before check-in to confirm our needs and were helpful in giving directions. The breakfast was rich and of good quality. They gave little lion pendants to the children. They understood the itinerary needs and even helped contact colleagues in Nanjing to take care of us when they knew we were going to Nanjing. It was very helpful. grateful. All in all, it was a very pleasant stay at the Ritz-Carlton in Shanghai. I will continue to choose the Ritz-Carlton in Pudong next time I return to Shanghai! Thanks again to all the Ritz friends I met. I also wish everyone good luck in the new year and smooth work in the new year!

msg:My stay coincided with a rare foggy day in Shanghai, and I experienced a different Lujiazui. As a parent-child brand, riz is very cost-effective at this location. I was deeply impressed by the Pearl River View Room + Flair + buffet breakfast + the one-Michelin-starred Jinxuan Chinese Restaurant. It also has a gym and swimming pool to meet my daily needs.
If I give advice to Pudong riz that even picky guests like me can fall in love with, I will think of her as the number one hotel in China recommended by major hotel evaluation websites from 2019 to 2021. Of course, considering that we receive guests from all over the world with different backgrounds every day in such a geographical location, it is still one of the best hotels in China. What else can I ask for? Thanks for the excellent service and hope the hotel will get better and better.

This kind of service and trea**ent often appears in our overseas travels, and we see us traveling with various little dolls. We are often given hotel mascots as gifts, and this time the courtesy at the Ritz-Carlton in Pudong left a deep impression on us.
The originally booked Bund River View Suite was upgraded to a Double View Suite because there was no vacancy at the time of check-in. It is said that it is second only to the Presidential Suite. The problem was solved promptly and properly. After seeing the sincerity of the hotel, I will choose to stay here again next time. .
The service and dishes in the lobby bar and Siena Italian Restaurant are both commendable. The only flaw is still the flair bar on the top floor. The service needs to be improved. I hope more consideration can be given to improving the service quality for guests.

As soon as I drove to the door, there were staff members who promptly helped to carry my luggage and efficiently guided me to the check-in front desk. At the same time, there were particularly enthusiastic staff members who came to help me with the check-in process. After checking in, a dedicated customer service staff took us to the room; to our surprise, they upgraded us to a deluxe family suite with river view. The fruit plate in the room was very fresh and rich, even though I only found that one of the cherries was lacking. When it was fresh, Vicky gave very timely feedback and made up a new fruit plate, and also brought Michelle a beautiful pink balloon. Michelle particularly liked the colorful crayons and booklets prepared by the hotel for the children, and she even drew one for her uncle Xiaozhu, a professional dentist in Shanghai, at his request. Details determine success or failure. After personal experience, I can deeply understand why there is such a good quality customer base and super high customer loyalty. I look forward to staying at The Ritz-Carlton again next time.

The hotel is clean and hygienic, with relatively complete facilities and good facilities. The equipment and furnishings in the room are quite good and quite satisfactory. Unfortunately, although I chose a Bund-view room, due to the haze, I could barely see the Bund.
Then there’s the service that polarizes my feelings. Some of the staff, such as the hotel lobby manager and the doorman on the first floor, provide very good service. They are able to provide proactive service, speak well and act proactively and appropriately. On the other hand, I originally made an appoin**ent to check in after one o'clock in the afternoon, but later checked in a little later. It was three o'clock, but they informed me that there was no room to be cleaned and I could not check in. I waited until after four o'clock impatiently to check in. This was the first experience in more than ten years. It was a super bad review. Another experience of being refused a room upgrade for the first time in history. In other hotels, if the original room type cannot be checked in for a long time, the hotel will take the initiative to upgrade the room type. However, this hotel not only did not, but also flatly refused the room upgrade plan after the guest proposed it, which made me People who have stayed in five-star hotels for more than 20 years have opened their eyes for the first time, and the negative reviews are not unfair. Moreover, when I couldn't check in and had to wait, I couldn't bear it after standing in the lobby for a long time. I went to sit next to it and rested. I was told that as long as I sat down, I had to consume. I had no choice but to order tea that cost 200 to 300 yuan, and the mandatory consumption came again. Wow, that was so cruel. I wanted to complain on the spot. This place is a good place. I won’t come here again.

msg:I came to Shanghai for a short vacation over the weekend. I booked the Ritz based on the location, shopping convenience, and scenery. After being introduced to the room type by the lady at the front desk, I chose to upgrade to a river view room. It was a great experience. The location is opposite the Wanguo Building Complex. , you can look at the scenery for a long time~

Special thanks to Teresa for her excellent service and explanation. She proactively provided suggestions on customized room cards, bathtub covers, afternoon tea and flair, etc. Her sweet smile is very cute, and her handwritten blessings are also very thoughtful!!

The variety of breakfast is less than expected, but the view of the Oriental Pearl Tower in the restaurant can make up for some regrets.

The overall experience is great! From the moment we stepped into the hotel, all the staff were very nice! We also gave the kids 5 meals a day in the executive lounge! My photography skills are limited and I didn’t take many photos! The river view is very nice, and it’s also nice to look at it in a daze! Looking forward to seeing you next time!

msg:MELODY is very professional and her service is very good👍If she could be more calm and provide more meticulous service, it would be even more perfect.

Pros and cons of the hotel:
First, the breakfast is rich. But the taste is more suitable for foreigners. The noodles are terrible.
Second, the transportation is convenient, and the nearby Pudong Museum of Art is a very beautiful place.
Third, the complimentary fruits would be more valuable if they were fresher.
Fourth, thank you for the customized room card.
Fifth, the gym fruit appears to be protected.
It would be better if a customer comes to the store with a warm towel or a hot drink.
Fortunately, I didn't have to wait too long to check in. In fact, you can learn from other hotels and call customers in advance to make some preparations.

You can see the incomparable views of the Pujiang River and the Bund, and the brilliant Oriental Pearl Tower is right in front of you. The room, including the sanitary facilities, is very comfortable and clean. The mattress and pillows are very comfortable to sleep on. There is also the hotel's warm and considerate service. You can call us to ask for details before checking in, and you will be given welcome fruit as soon as you check in. I would like to specially mention Flora here. Not only is her service beautiful, she is also very considerate. Not only did she accompany us to the room after check-in, she also carefully gave us a bath bag and quickly helped us solve the problem in the follow-up service. I really appreciate Flora’s attentive service👍The Ritz-Carlton gave me a very wonderful experience!

Especially Ms. Vicky from the Guest Awareness Depar**ent, seeing that we had a baby, she thoughtfully prepared a baby bed curtain for us, and also gave us an extra rich fruit plate that the baby could eat, which was very heart-warming.
Taking a bath in the big bathtub is very comfortable, and the warm glow of the sunset in the evening is unobstructed.
Btw The Ritz-Carlton not only has fresh fruits and delicious chocolate snacks, but also has a rich and varied breakfast variety and the taste is also very satisfying.
All five-star reviews!

Especially satisfied with the service. After booking the hotel, the hotel staff Irena called me to find out the reason for my stay. After I arrived at the hotel, Irena gave me a detailed introduction to the hotel's facilities and floors. When she learned that I was here to celebrate my 10th anniversary, Irena also specially helped me simply decorate the room, which instantly gave the room a sense of a**osphere. Thank you very much to her.
The view of the hotel is also very good, you can directly see the Oriental Pearl Tower and a little bit of the Bund. I purchased two breakfasts and arranged a seat by the window. It tastes good too.
I will stay at the Ritz-Carlton next time I come to Shanghai.

msg:I booked a double bed room with a view of the Bund. When I arrived at the hotel on the same day, the front desk upgraded it to a presidential suite. It was a big waste for me to live in a 400-square-meter room by myself. The room is really big. Of course, the best thing is the window. The invincible night view directly facing the Oriental Pearl Tower, the 180° super beautiful night view with no blind spots from the living room to the bathroom, is worth it! The service and attitude of the old hotel are quite good. Although there is a little hiccup, it can be ignored ~ I will consider booking next time!

msg:[Brief Comment] This is the best hotel to see the night view of the Oriental Pearl Tower. In addition, you can see a few Peace Hotels diagonally.
[Account] 1. The service is really good, and it’s the kind where not just one individual, but the whole team feels great, which makes people like me who don’t care so much about service feel a little flattered; 2. Stayed 39 The Pearl View Room on the first floor is also the lowest floor of the hotel. I was a little disappointed at first because after entering the room, I found that I could only see part of the Oriental Pearl Tower in the middle, but it was not bad because you could see the full view while sitting by the window. Think about it. It may also be better for viewing (the high-floor Pearl Tower can be viewed from the public lounge and restaurant on the 52nd floor, so staying on the 39th floor actually provides another height). Unfortunately, it was already dark when we arrived at the store due to traffic jam, and we missed the sunset and the bright lights. If I had known better, I would have taken the subway. 3. The swimming pool is great. In addition to swimming, it also has a pleasing function. I regret not going up to the bar because I was too tired. 4. There are many movie choices in the room, but they are basically all foreign movies. Of course, you can feel it. There are also many Chinese and foreign tourists staying at the hotel. 5. Children’s tents, small school bags, and snacks can really win over children’s hearts. Once the children are happy, the adults will also be happy. This strategy is really easy to use... 6. There is food downstairs. There is also a supermarket, which is convenient for shopping and walking around.
[Breakfast] At first, I read various reviews that the breakfast was monotonous, but after testing it myself, I thought it was okay. I personally hope that there are more Chinese options. Maybe people who find it boring go to the executive lounge instead of the one on the 52nd floor? If you get up early, it’s nice to take pictures of the scenery by the restaurant window.
[Others] There is a slight flaw in the bathroom. When I wash my hands and turn on the faucet, the ceiling shower in the bathroom also starts to leak water for some reason. After turning off the faucet, the shower is still ticking. Fortunately, it stops on its own after leaving it for a while. , so there is no warranty. In addition, after the faucet in the bathtub was turned on, water began to seep from the shower joint of the bathtub. I didn't notice it at first, and the water dripped onto the ground and seeped into the hallway. I quickly used paper towels to block the cracks in the floor. Later, I simply threw the shower head into the bathtub, so that the water leakage would not matter.

The facilities in the room are also great, the decoration is elegant and grand, and the hotel also very warmly arranged birthday balloons and presented a cake!
The afternoon tea and lunch and dinner in the executive lounge are also excellent, the desserts are exquisite, and the choices for lunch and dinner are also rich. As for breakfast, the quality is as good as ever. Gourmet coffee and the scenery of the Oriental Pearl Tower start a happy day. I also have to mention the constant-temperature soaking pool in the spa. Soaking in the hot spring while overlooking the Bund is definitely a worthwhile experience!
Finally, I would like to thank the Ashin team for their attentive and meticulous service and Ruby and Indy for their thoughtful and special decoration of the room. My mother was very happy with her stay and said she would bring her friends next time.

When she saw my daughter using a small spoon to scoop out the ice cream sandwiched between soufflé puffs, she was worried that we would be allergic and it would be inconvenient to eat. , and they served us two balls of vanilla ice cream separately. We didn’t ask for anything, but the young lady observed the meticulous service provided by my daughter’s small gesture. This really touched my heart. Not only the detailed services such as restaurants, guest rooms, and swimming pools are also done very well. Here, I would also like to express my special thanks to Brother Patrick and Miss Vicky for their considerate and warm service.

The day before check-in, the hotel staff, Miss Filly, is very enthusiastic to ask about your needs! Knowing that there were children accompanying us, we prepared small gifts for the children when they checked in, and prepared the children's toiletries in advance! Miss Jessi also thoughtfully prepared a children’s picture book for the children! When we entered the room, Miss Filly greeted us with a smile and took the initiative to lead us to the guest room!
In short, the overall environment and services of the Ritz-Carlton Hotel are very good! Breakfast is also very delicious

Every area in the living room, room, and bathroom can see the beautiful scenery of the Magic City. Ms. Sara’s service is warm, sunny, meticulous and thoughtful. She sent a small cake, a birthday card, and a cute little lion~

Standing in the room, I could overlook the entire Oriental Pearl River view. The most important thing was that I met Miss Sara, who was kind and kind from the beginning. After checking in, I was accompanied and taken care of very attentively. I knew that my child had a birthday and prepared small gifts and fruit desserts. It’s so considerate to provide responsive service! A very good experience. I will come here next time to see Sara.

The breakfast room had a sweeping view of the river and the meals were rich and exquisite. The service was professional and meticulous from arrival to departure, allowing us to refresh ourselves in a short period of time.
Thanks to Ruby's considerate service, the children received super cute souvenirs and their own customized room cards, which made them extremely happy.
I have recommended this place to my friends and hope to come again if I have the opportunity.

msg:When traveling to Shanghai with my parents and children, I was most satisfied with my stay at the Ritz. The location of the hotel is truly unbeatable. The room with the best view on the upper floors of Pudong is the Ritz’s Oriental Pearl Room. If you want to see Shanghai Tower and other skyscrapers at the same time, choose a panoramic room. The room is on the corner and is larger than the Oriental Pearl Room. It has a window sill bathtub, but the location for viewing the Oriental Pearl is not so direct, so it is suitable for viewing during the day. The hotel's cleanliness and reception are as good as ever, but the quality of the breakfast needs to be improved. Finally, I would like to thank Vicky from the Guest Awareness Depar**ent for her gentleness, beauty, and considerate service. She also gave small gifts to the children before leaving. All in all, the elderly and children were very satisfied with this trip.

Ritz Carlton, gorgeous style.
The front desk of the hotel on the 52nd floor has really endured too much. There are queues among guests, and there is such a shortage of sofa seats for waiting. I dare say that this is the area with the smallest area per person in the Ritz-Carlton hotel. After queuing for a long time, the on-site staff brought tea. This tea cup, in a large sense, is the cup of Piccolo in the cafe, and in a small way, it is the cup of free drinks in the coffee shop. I'm so tired.

After obtaining the room card, Teresa led us to the room and mainly helped carry bags. I was so embarrassed. She introduced us to the room and introduced us cordially.
Later, the hotel staff brought me the mineral water I asked for. I was shocked at how much there was, but I almost used it by the next day.
The welcome fruits in the room and the fruit snacks available at night are very nice.

The bathtub in the room is quite comfortable, the bed is a bit soft for me, the room is very quiet, and I have a good rest.

The registration staff kindly upgraded me to the Pearl Room, but I actually prefer the view of the Bund.
I visited the swimming pool on the 53rd floor and it was very nice. Next time I will bring a swimsuit to take a dip.

1. Five meals a day on the executive floor for free 😜 Drinks can be taken back to the room to drink (Jinmao has three meals)
2. The room is a three-piece suite, but you can't see the Oriental Pearl Tower (the Oriental Pearl Suite is smaller), but you can see a little bit on the Bund
3. The bathtub is comfortable
4. There are simple birthday decorations and small cakes
5. The waiters are very enthusiastic and professional
shortcoming:
1. There is no bath in the swimming pool, and the steam room is relatively small. Jin Mao's bath is very comfortable haha
2. It was noted in advance that a higher floor is required, but in the end it was only 41 floors (did you forget, but you can check in after 11 o'clock)
3. The light in the room was broken, and the maintenance master came to fix it right away; later, I sent two welcome fruits and a welcome card, and I didn’t say whether it was the reason
4. Parking fee is inevitable
5. When checking in, friends who come to play together must show their ID cards. Alipay’s electronic ID card is also not acceptable (the page with the photo of the ID card is required). The friend said that he would not check in at night. , it is recommended to register the ID number later, don’t be so rigid

The overall price/performance ratio is not as high as Jinmao’s diplomatic suites, and you can also live in W and Banyan Tree suites with a little more money. If you like to eat and eat, you can live here.

I just went swimming in the swimming pool, something went wrong, I took my child to swim, and the three children were playing together, but in the process of swimming, I met an adult, that woman was very unqualified, not only scolded the child, but also beat my child! I still have to bite back and complain... When I scolded the child, I endured it and didn't say anything. After all, I came out to play, and the boy was indeed a little naughty, but adults have to say it, you can't scold the child, let alone beat the child! Of course, as a parent, I also keep an eye on my children all the time, don’t fight and try to be quiet, but children are more children, and when they are naughty, they are also consumers. We have the right to enjoy it, and so do others. Communication, beating and swearing is really unbearable, but we still endure it, after all, we only play for a day or two, there is no need to care about like people without quality! What I want to say is, if the hotel has such long-term members, can the swimming pool be separated into one area for children and one area for adults or members? Also, the breakfast in the hotel is really average. It's not a bit chaotic on weekend mornings, and the taste is also very average! The public area may not feel five-star because of the large number of people! The rooms are still very good! The concierge is also very enthusiastic! I had great expectations for Shanghai Ritz, but this time I was a little disappointed!

msg:As Black Diamond users, there are only a handful of comments, as shown in Figure 1. I have never been so eager to review a hotel, and I can't do it later because I am too busy to forget the next day.

Let's not mention the new and old hardware environment of room size and equipment, which is not easy to change over time, let's talk about the service concept. Not an overall comment, just two specific things that I encountered:

1. For dinner at the western restaurant on the 52nd floor (near the Oriental Pearl Tower), the time from ordering to 20 minutes before serving is good. There is no complaint about service and serving. But since a group of foreign friends came to have a party at the table next to me, everything has changed. The follow-up meal and service have also disappeared. I silently watched the lively party and the busy scene of the service staff for 30 minutes. After a long time, I realized later that they only love others and not me. Afterwards, I urged my meal more quietly, and watched the scene I described before for another ten minutes, but I still didn't get my dessert, so I called the manager (let's call it that) to help I rushed down my dessert, which was good this time, and he quickly brought my ice cream. I could have ended this not-so-pleasant and not-so-angry dinner, but the manager's words made me go wild in an instant! He said this: Sorry to keep you waiting, because this ice cream is freshly dug, so it took a little longer... I don’t know if you understand my thunder point, anyway, I was angry at that moment, but I Still not excited but clearly stated my dissatisfaction. The manager is actually quite good at handling this kind of thing. He is a qualified manager. He waived the cost of extra meals and drinks and gave a doll. I accepted it and the first thing was done.

2. Breakfast is still in this restaurant. When I entered the door, the staff arranged a seat next to the Oriental Pearl Tower by the window, and said that the place is reserved for you to go and pick up the meal, okay! Sure enough, when he came back after picking up the meal, someone else's plate was already there. I asked the nearest staff is this the place that was reserved for me? She said that this position is occupied, it should not be. I did get dizzy for a while but I took a look, it must be, I was depressed at the table next to this table last night. So I firmly said that this is my seat, and then the magic operation came, the staff member went to consult another colleague and came back to discuss with me: Sorry, a foreign lady just used this seat, can you please Can't switch places? I? ? ? ? ? I really don't understand her words! I said I'm sorry, I don't accept it, and then she went to communicate with her colleagues and came back and repeated it to me: Can you change the position? I also continued to repeat to her that I'm sorry, I don't accept it. So she had no choice but to communicate with the foreign lady, saying that the staff made a mistake and arranged for someone else before, and asked her if she could change the seat. Fortunately, the foreign lady is a reasonable person, and the second matter is over. .

I will not summarize or evaluate the above two things, because the results are not bad for me. Everyone who can insist on seeing here can have a taste, isn't it a bit indescribable taste.

Five-star and above hotels don’t have a lot of hardware, and it’s enough to see the scenery once or twice. The old Chinese saying that guests feel at home is not only applicable to Chinese hotels.

ps: Because of the above two incidents, I am concerned about the following: the welcome fruit is not welcome, three small ping-pong apples are coming, the hair dryer is fixed in place with nails, we don’t know why...other hardware Not to mention the minor problems encountered...


A good compliment: The Indonesian lady on the 52nd floor is nice, and the concierge staff on the first floor are all great! The scenery is nice.

When staying at the Ritz, a thin little girl (forgot her name) at the front desk patiently checked in and upgraded the executive suite to a full sea view room according to needs. The Bund view is superb👍. The service in the executive lounge is very good, the opening hours are very long, there are many types of food, and the taste is very good👍👍👍A young girl with big eyes is very enthusiastic and loves to smile. 👍👍

The view from the room is nothing to say, it's still very good, but no one answered the room service call several times😅The service can't keep up with the price.

There are stains on the sofa that can't be cleaned. The paint on the corner of the table is also chipped. Tattered! The room can be used to film TV series from the 1980s and 1990s. It has a great sense of era! Nothing like the configuration of a five-star hotel! I really don’t know where all the five-star reviews on Ctrip come from, and I’m telling the truth! The scenery outside the window is okay. If you can't see the Oriental Pearl Tower up close, who would stay in a hotel with a price of 3,000+ would be a big injustice! In addition, the breakfast is really average, too bland, the variety is popular, and the taste is average! It has no characteristics of its own! Really do not recommend staying! The pictures on the hotel website are all highly polished, so don’t completely believe them!

We stayed in an executive bund room, the view from the room is facing the bund, it is very beautiful at night! The bed in the room is very comfortable, the most comfortable sleep in the Ritz-Carlton for a few days! The toilet is also smart, but the sound is much smaller than W's flushing sound, which is very good! The hotel is just above the IFC, so it is very convenient for shopping, eating, watching movies and drinking coffee! The Oriental Pearl Tower is next to it, and the Disney flagship store is opposite, so you can buy peripheral products without going to Disney! The five meals a day at the hotel are really full and delicious! Ritz's desserts are the most delicious I have ever eaten in any hotel! Special thanks to Cynthia from the administration depar**ent, she is super beautiful and super nice! Every time we appear in the executive lounge, she can call out our names, and remember each guest's name among the many guests every day, it is really warm and caring! In the future, I will lock Ritz-Carlton every time I do it!

msg:Choosing the Ritz-Carlton for a family trip during the holidays brought us many surprises. First of all, the location of the hotel is superior. It is located in the center of Lujiazui. The next floor is the ifc International Financial Mall. You can pass through the mall and go directly to the subway station. The transportation is very convenient. Secondly, the hotel's various room types have excellent views. From different orientations, you can enjoy the Lujiazui three-piece suite, the Huangpu River, the Oriental Pearl Tower and other landmarks, with a panoramic view. The Oriental Pearl View Room I stayed in this time is located on the 51st floor, and I was really amazed the moment I walked into the room. Then, the food in the hotel is also the reason why we choose Ritz. The breakfast in the restaurant on the 52nd floor upholds the high standard of Ritz, with rich varieties, which can meet the needs of different appetites. The waiters are warm, courteous and considerate, and there is one small detail that is well done. That is, all the dinner plates are warmed up in advance, clean and considerate. Although I didn’t experience all the 5 buffets a day in the executive lounge on the 49th floor, the afternoon tea and dinner I tasted were carefully prepared. The children praised the Japanese ramen and small desserts and never forgot.

Finally, I would like to thank Charles at the front desk for his help during check-in, and for arranging the view room with the best location, which is great! Thanks to all the staff in the executive lounge, especially Laura and Venessa, who are as warm and friendly as friends. Laura gave us a lot of good suggestions for sightseeing and travel. When I learned that we were too late to visit the Bund, she gave us a special gift before leaving. A picture of the Bund river view as a gift. And the lovely Venessa who makes him a delicious glass of chocolate milk every evening when the kid goes over for chocolate. Thank you for making our journey a lot of warm memories. Next time we travel, we will also choose Ritz-Carlton, love ♥️!

3. The standard of hotel buffet breakfast and western dinner is relatively high, the taste and environment are good.
4. The gym is open 24 hours, and you can enter by swiping the door card, which is more convenient!
bad side:
1. The swimming pool is being renovated in summer, which is quite strange!
2. The public space of the hotel is very limited, and there is no feeling of vacation. In addition to the room, you can go to the two restaurants on the 52nd floor and the bar restaurant on the 58th floor. There is a restaurant that does not allow in-house guests to visit during its opening in the afternoon. The night view of the bar restaurant on the 58th floor is okay.
3. The deposit was 2,000 when you checked in, and more than 1,900 was refunded a day later, which is tens of yuan less. I called to inquire, and they said that there was a bug in the restaurant's restaurant bill, and they didn't know the reason. At first, they said that it would take 15 days for a refund, but now they said that it should be processed urgently, and the refund will be refunded in about 10 days! The hotel's problems have affected customers. Apart from saying sorry, I didn't feel the service that a five-star hotel should have!

The location of the hotel itself is next to the Pearl Tower. It is really too close to the main tourist attractions in Pudong. You can take a stroll and walk to get everything done. The shopping mall downstairs has too many brands. It is so convenient to spend money hahaha
To be honest, the room facilities are a bit old, after all, it is the first year here, but the view, service, food, and comfort are all full marks

I rushed to Shanghai from Ningbo to celebrate my girlfriend’s birthday. The restaurant was booked in Flair, the top floor dining bar of the Ritz-Carlton. The room should also be booked in Liz

The little brother Barry at the front desk is very enthusiastic. He heard that I came to accompany my girlfriend's birthday and quietly upgraded me to a river view room. Ashine and Gloria at the concierge arranged balloon bouquets and small cakes while I was picking up my girlfriend, which was a great surprise.

The room is a very typical Ritz-Carlton retro style (different people have different opinions, if you are used to the modern style, this may be a bit old-fashioned). The 50-square-meter room is equipped with an oversized bathtub and huge floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the Bund at night.

Because it is the rainy season, the elevator aisle has a slight damp smell, I hope the dehumidification system can be strengthened

Of course, the overall most satisfying thing is the hotel concierge. Although I only stayed for one night, at least three different staff members recognized me during the period. This attentiveness and service greatly enhances the goodwill. This is not the trea**ent I have stayed in many hotels of the same price for four or five days. I believe that people in this level of hotel are more memorable than hardware.

A hotel with a human touch will surely bring a satisfying experience.

There is drinking water next to the bed, which is very thoughtful. The fruit plate provided tastes good, and the breakfast has many varieties and tastes good.

The room facilities are complete, and the style feels more neo-classical. The location is on the 42nd floor, and you can clearly see the Huangpu River and the most prosperous areas in Puxi while lying on the bed. I like the bathtub layout of the room the most, the bathing experience is not too good!

The breakfast is a combination of Chinese and Western, with a complete range. Dessert wife is delicious!

We checked in and caught up with the renovation party of the rooftop bar. Don’t be too excited about the party under the Oriental Pearl Tower.

It's the best weekend experience ever!

Winnie at the front desk kindly helped me upgrade to the Oriental Pearl Suite (paid), and also gave me two additional executive benefits and late check-out. Thanks for the birthday cake. The food in the executive lounge has no fault for taste, but the dishes have obviously been downgraded. Also, is the swimming pool open to non-hotel guests? Not so good.
The only dissatisfaction was when I asked whether there was no need to charge for children's breakfast in the Western restaurant because the executive benefits were given, I found that the executive lounge, restaurant and front desk do not share the guest information for this? I still had to ask for a long time, is this a system bug?
Overall, it is more user-friendly than before, but the experience remains on the downward trend of the program being more professional but not careless, and the hard quality declining. ☺

msg:The experience this time was indeed poor, mainly due to the following points:
1. The check-in speed was so slow that I doubted my life. I stood dryly in the lobby for about 20 years with no one paying attention or asking questions.
2. The front desk is on the 52nd floor, and I have a lot of luggage to carry. The front desk told me that I don’t need to carry this much luggage myself next time. When I got on the elevator on the first floor, no one from the management took the initiative to ask if I needed help. Isn’t this an afterthought? .
3. The room rate is more than 3,700, and the room includes two breakfasts. In the past, other hotels of the same level would basically provide a children's breakfast. This time, I was ruthlessly rejected. I had no choice but to eat it by myself.
4. There are few types of breakfast, and the restaurant is also small, which is not in line with the standard of a hotel of this level. In order to manage meals and give room cards, you have to sign and write in block letters, as if you are cheating on food and drink. The executive lounge has very little food and the hall is not big.
5. To go to the first floor, you need to go around on the 52nd floor, which is a little inconvenient.
6. There are so many rules in the hotel that I feel very uncomfortable.
7. Travelers who don’t like too many rules and not being taken seriously should choose carefully.

I can't imagine that a spa in a five-star hotel has a public changing room with lockers. I don’t know if the hotel has a bad relationship with the International Finance Center, but it doesn’t waive the parking fee. I really haven’t heard of any hotel in the country like this. The front desk of the hotel is so confident and their service attitude is rubbish. They treat guests like slaves. They booked an executive river view room and were given a river view room at random. When asked why it was not on the executive floor, they casually said that there are executive rooms on every floor. I don’t know. Does the hotel provide on-the-job training? This is the attitude towards guests. The attitude during check-in and check-out was also very bad, and I ignored you. I really don’t know where I got my confidence from. I don’t want to belittle you, but I really can’t bear it.

Manager of the Guest Recognition Depar**ent, Michael, recommended an upgrade to the Pearl Suite. The view is great, facing the Oriental Pearl Tower, and it is very suitable for taking pictures when the lights are on at night. The services of Irena, Gloria, and Flora are very heartwarming.

For my girlfriend's birthday, I called to arrange the birthday decoration in advance, and there was a handwritten greeting card, which was very attentive. High floors are specially arranged. From arrival, check-in, meals, to check-out, it can be said that everything is perfect except for the weather.
Although I couldn't see the night view of the Oriental Pearl Tower, I saw the cloud-shrouded Lujiazui and North Bund buildings during the day, which is very rare to see from a high altitude.
Ritz-Carlton's ingot-shaped bathtub and luxurious bathroom are impressive. You can watch a small TV and watch the Oriental Pearl Tower in the bath~
Although the hotel has a history of more than ten years, it can be seen that the facilities and equipment are well maintained, and the golden ice cracks are luxurious but not exaggerated.
Gloria Ashin Irena Filly Patrick Candice and teacher Bian who received and arranged, thank you very much.

msg:Their service is definitely up to the standard of a five-star hotel, and they truly make customers feel at home. From the gate on the first floor downstairs to the front desk reception, room service, restaurant, bar, etc., all the staff are very enthusiastic. It can be said that every corner is full of warmth, as if treating you as a regular guest, but it doesn’t make you feel restrained. This is a particularly good place. Some big hotels are too warm and it’s not good, you will feel uncomfortable , but the Ritz-Carlton Pudong store does not have this feeling, it is very relaxed, and they care about every word you say, I just mentioned something I like, they can give it to me later, I I have forgotten that everyone has already remembered my surname. I feel like an old customer here. I feel very pampered. The room is also very cost-effective. Because I have stayed here once before, I like it very much. I really want to come again , I especially recommend this room called the Bund Panoramic Suite. I really like it. It is about 100 square meters. The entire semicircular wall is full of floor-to-ceiling glass. The night view is simply stunning. I didn't book it this time, so I couldn't take pictures. I forgot to take pictures before. I will take pictures and upload them when I have a chance. This time, there are only panoramic light luxury deluxe rooms

Why do I have to wait until three o'clock to check in if I ask to check out at twelve o'clock?

This stay was really lucky to meet my daughter's Swiss alumni Patrick, who took good care of every aspect of the hotel. He helped us book a very good place for afternoon tea when we checked in, and sent us to the car when we checked out. The character is also really good!

When I was having afternoon tea at the hotel, I accidentally mentioned that I really like the tea I chose today. The caring Ms. Kayla wrote a greeting card and gave me a tea bag for free. It was really a surprise~

Although there were some accidents during the breakfast, Manager Rita melted people's hearts with this little lion!

Also thanks to Ashin Gloria Flora Filly for taking care of me!

This stay has also strengthened my determination to choose the Ritz-Carlton brand in the future!

msg:Personally, I think the Ritz is a hotel full of advantages in details
He mentioned that because his son had chosen Ritz for his birthday the next day, he immediately sent a blessing cake. The five meals a day of the administrative courtesy also showed thoughtful service in every way. When I didn't have any, I heard the children complain, and I gave the children a little bit of rectification alone. The fly in the oin**ent is that when booking this round, I didn't call in advance to confirm it like last time. It may be true that after the epidemic is over, the hotel ushered in the peak period of reception, so I didn't take care of it. The other thing is to post employees on WeChat. In fact, the information should be transmitted in a standardized manner. Employee A is off work, and employee B should take over the evening work. The work WeChat account should be handed over, so that customer needs may not be delayed, otherwise there will be no It is necessary to continue to use the guest room phone to communicate through the practice of adding WeChat. Also, after many stays, I personally feel that the facilities and decoration of the room do need to be optimized, otherwise it may not be able to keep up with the brand. In addition, as a personal suggestion, you can consider setting up a discount coupon to collect the parking fee of the hotel, instead of simply capping it at 112 a day. Although the main purpose of everyone is not to save dozens of dollars, but this way the experience will be better. Can feel the hotel's struggle for customer needs.

The hotel called one day in advance to inquire about customary requirements, etc., and received a warm reception when we checked in. The view of the room is even more beautiful, with a sweeping view of the Bund, and the Oriental Pearl Tower is next to it. Especially the night view is more beautiful. The breakfast is great, with many varieties. One day during our stay, we had to catch the high-speed train to Hangzhou. The hotel knew that we had no time to eat breakfast, so we packed a special one. It was a big bag, eggs, milk, fruit snacks and Yakult, which made us feel like ourselves I went to have a picnic by the West Lake. Room service is also very good, plenty of purified water, capsule coffee machine. Downstairs are various big brands and an imported supermarket. It's also very convenient to go out. You can walk to Shanghai Ocean Aquarium, or take a ferry to Yu Garden for snacks. In short, I hope you are very satisfied and will stay again if you have the opportunity.

It has been half a month, and there is a hair on the table. I stayed for a few days. It has been so unchanged, so it is the hygiene level of the Express Hotel. Besides, the service calls at night were not answered, the room was very noisy, and the front desk of the room change said to ask the leader for instructions, and finally changed the room twice and barely fell asleep. The sound insulation is poor. Although the sound insulation conditions of hotels are not good now, Pudong Leeds is different. He can even hear the sound of someone dragging a suitcase in the aisle in the room. The turndown service is even more wonderful. After staying for three days, the waiter came once without pressing Do Not Disturb and expressed his amazement! In general, I spent the money of a five-star hotel to live in a hotel. So please avoid lightning if you have requirements for hygiene and hotel services.

msg:1. After arrival, the first floor needs to be improved in terms of helping guests open the door and assisting with luggage. Secondly, after arriving on the 52nd floor, while waiting for check-in, the guiding girl located in the lobby on the 52nd floor, in addition to guiding, let me find that she especially likes and "addicted" to chatting with other people. The temperature in summer is next to fruit tea. Maybe hinting at me, it was a decoration, no fruit and no tea in it.

2. In terms of room check-in and experience, the chocolates and fruits given away, and the room upgrade by Zora, the girl at the front desk, etc., Ritz-Carlton does maintain the high quality and service represented by its own brand. But from the guest room experience, the floor is noisy, the lights in the bathroom are whistling, and when I was still sleeping, I received a call to clean the glass for no reason (this reminder card has been clearly placed in the room), Really annoying.

3. It is the focus of this time, about the Flair bar. Let's start with the initial reservation. Because I saw the weather forecast and worried about the impact of "Kanu", I called and said to reserve the indoor seats first. As a result, a lady from the restaurant said on the phone that roughly the original words "can also be booked Indoor seating, but no guarantee of outdoor seating that day, if you're willing to take the risk..."What? Is a seat at risk? Compared with the risk in your mouth and "Kanu", which one do you think is more risky?
As a result, at night, there were not many people in the outdoor seats all night, and most of them were taking pictures and checking in. I had booked a set meal, but when I arrived, the staff didn't know. Secondly, the hotel charged a deposit of 2,000 yuan per night, but the consumption at Flair that night far exceeded the deposit. I wanted to include it in the room account, but after signing, the staff said that the deposit was not enough and needed to make up the deposit. Ah no, do you think guests will "slip away" without checking out the next day? A long time ago, I had dinner with my friends at the Scena restaurant and was immediately stopped. The scene was so embarrassing. I didn't expect that the service and the use of speaking skills were still so bad after several years.
In the end, I chose to pay directly, but I forgot about the Marriott points, and it became so difficult to redeem the points the next day. Obviously it has been credited, but the customer is asked to provide the consumption details page. I asked what is the details page and so on. I did not reply to the message for more than three hours, until I called, and said, "Impossible Watch the news at any time", and the lady on the other end of the phone interrupted me several times, showed impatience several times, and finally didn't want to talk, just pretended that I couldn't hear the voice on the other end of the phone, and hung up the phone to make this kind of behavior Extremely bad behavior on the service. But before I joined their official WeChat account, I was extremely enthusiastic before booking a table, and my attitude was bad after consumption, which was like a one-shot deal.
More than 24 hours after the incident, neither the hotel nor the restaurant contacted me before publishing this comment. I will also send the matter to Marriott headquarters in more detail in English in the near future. Even if I don't want the points I spent that night, I still need a basic apology and the minimum respect as a guest.

Yesterday, the young lady at the front desk helped us postpone our check-out by an hour and arranged a room with a better view. Ms. Irena was super nice and considerate when checking out. Parking at the hotel is at your own expense, and IFC members can use points to deduct it.
The main focus of the hotel is the landscape, the sanitation facilities are very good, and the overall feeling is super satisfactory~

From the various introductions to the hotel, we can see that he is a good employee who loves work, loves the hotel and loves customers. It made us very warm and happy. During the three days of my stay, the two beauties Jennie and Violet at the front desk were kind and gentle to help me solve my worries many times. The hotel's executive lounge is very rich, and my son joked that five meals a day is a pig-feeding mode. The hotel's swimming pool is also very beautiful, and I enjoyed it very much these two days. Looking forward to the next reunion!

The location is super good, the shopping mall is just downstairs, shopping is very convenient, and the traffic is also very convenient when traveling. Secondly, the landscape is really good👍, and the lights are on at night, which makes people intoxicated. Finally, I would like to praise the hotel's service. The attitude is very good and considerate. Filly not only gave us a brief introduction but also asked about the experience of staying in time. Finally, I would like to thank Patrick for preparing a small gift for us. The experience is very good, and I have recommended it to relatives and friends around me.

Service: The next day is my husband's birthday. When I open the room, I can see the thoughtful decoration, delicious cake, handwritten greeting card and super rich welcome fruit
Food: The breakfast is very rich, and the various croissants produced by the Carlton Baking Kitchen are super delicious. There are also Shanghai-style fried buns and omelets, but unfortunately there is only one stomach~ In addition to the breakfast part, Carlton’s Jinxuan is also superb. On weekends, you can invite your girlfriends to have a lobster brunch (cereal lobster is really recommended). The view of the restaurant and bar on the top floor of FLAIR is also super beautiful. Even the side dishes are exquisite. The tomato vermouth is delicious. After only two sips, it was snatched away by the opposite one. Next time I go, I will order a glass alone. Going to make an appoin**ent on the terrace in spring or autumn, the experience should be better❤️

msg:As an important part of this trip to Shanghai, the Ritz-Carlton honestly let me down. . .

As a super five-star hotel, except for its superior location (the core of Lujiazui, next to the Oriental Pearl Tower), everything else is substandard!

1. It may still be the general disadvantage of the old five-star, the facilities are outdated, but I feel that the necessary maintenance is still needed, and the feeling of uncleanness can be felt everywhere. My wife planned to take a bath, but found that there was dirt in the bathtub. Body hair, unfortunately washed away. . .

2. The details are even more difficult to explain. The toilet door handle is installed crookedly, and the wallpaper in the corner is not pasted properly. Are you sure it is the core five-star requirement of Lujiazui?

3. I didn't find the requested welcome fruit when I checked in. I called to inquire and said that it would be delivered at 18:00. After 19:00, three very small apples arrived late. . . Compared with the 110 yuan bottle of fruit juice in the mini bar, I think they want to keep the big fruit for a fee?

Ritz-Carlton, better off! I will not choose this brand again next time!

This time I went to Shanghai mainly to go to China International Finance Corporation, so I booked the hotel closest to China Finance Corporation Limited. I think a five-star hotel, and it's a Ritz-Carlton, is definitely not bad... But from the hotel lobby to the corridor of the hotel room, the corridor smelled damp, which was very unpleasant. When we got to the room, the facilities were very old. It really didn’t look like a five-star hotel... There were two sockets in the room, one at the bedside and one at the water bar. The water bar also had a coffee machine plugged in, so I boiled water for my child. There is no place to insert breast milk... When taking a shower, the hot water needs to be put in for a long time to heat up. Hot water is not available as soon as you turn it on... After staying in so many hotels, I have never seen a hotel where you need to put cold water in for 20 minutes in advance to heat up... The swimming pool is also closed for renovation. All in all, my stay this time was very uncomfortable...I will never choose to stay here again...but the welcome service on the first floor was very good. Moreover, the breakfast is rich and delicious…

(2) The power socket on the bedside table is loose and can no longer charge electronic devices normally. The maintenance and inspection by the guest room engineering department is not in place. (3) The bathroom floor is paved with marble, but there is no "beware of slippery" sign visible to the naked eye. The floor is very slippery when wearing hotel slippers when it comes into contact with water. (4) There is a pervasive sewer smell in the bathroom. The hotel is relatively lacking in odor control and air optimization. Service: (1) The hotel's GSM and duty manager have a slow service pace, poor proactive service awareness, lack of communication skills, lack of empathy, and lack of skills in handling problems. (2) When faced with an emergency, the MOD and GSM did not communicate and apologize to the customer in the first place, which is aimed at maintaining the interests of the hotel and is contrary to your brand's consistent service concept. (3) During breakfast, a guest entered the dining area wearing the hotel's disposable slippers, and the hotel staff did not stop or remind them. In terms of the overall stay experience, the hotel has a superior location, and the service quality of the basic front-line staff is higher than that of the hotel's middle and senior management. Most employees will not take the initiative to greet guests in the public area, lack business etiquette, poor details, and need to improve their humanistic care. The overall service experience is average. Compared with other hotels of the same price and level, there is a big gap in hardware and software and room for improvement. I can only sigh that good employees have not met good leaders to lead them, resulting in poor connection between departments and poor customer experience. If you pursue service and quality, it is not recommended to choose the Pudong Ritz-Carlton. If you don't care about quality and experience for convenience, you can consider staying.

It is parked in the underground parking lot of Guojin International Finance Co., Ltd., and then it takes several hours to get from the garage to the hotel lobby. There are no elevators and escalators. It is very inconvenient for guests to check in with luggage from the garage. Secondly, the daily parking fee of 112 yuan also needs to be borne by themselves. 2. The equipment and facilities in the room are relatively old, sorry for the price. 3. The view from the view room was in a foggy day, and it was completely white outside. It had nothing to do with the weather.
In short, for this price, except for breakfast, everything else is not cost-effective. It is enough to suffer a loss once.

According to our needs, we arranged our favorite room facing the Oriental Pearl Tower. When we learned that it was a celebration On this day, the room was specially decorated and small desserts were presented. The service was impeccable and we had a perfect evening with a great view. Special thanks to morgen, ethan and cynthia for their great service. We will still choose the Ritz Carlton for our next vacation.

msg:I went to the front desk after 12 o'clock in the evening and was told that my order could not be found and I could not check in. I don't know if it was due to Ctrip or the hotel. The welcome fruit exchanged for points was said to be delivered the next day, but it was not delivered until I left at 11:40 the next day. It probably meant that I was not welcome. At breakfast the next day, I found that the bottom of the milk glass was all black. It must be that the lead contained in the glaze has come out. A five-star hotel uses such unsavory stuff. I told the waiters that they probably wouldn’t understand what anti-lead is. He looked very happy. Based on the above, it is not an exaggeration to give a five-star negative review.

msg:I often come to the Ritz-Carlton, and this time I came to stay again when I was free on weekends. Before I came, I met the hotel guest experience director and recommended the Pearl Bund Double View Suite to me. The landscape is absolutely invincible and superb. You can look around the entire Huangpu River Bund Oriental Pearl Tower. Even though it is raining, the night view is still very good. Late check-out was arranged on the second day, and the service of the guest recognition team was very good. Cici Ashin Patrick morgen jessee Bill Jackson Ethan were all very enthusiastic, and the Ritz always made people feel at home. The breakfast tastes very good, and it is very delicate. The restaurant can also see the river view. The overall experience is very good ~ shopping and eating are very convenient, and it is the first choice for travel.

msg:The Ritz-Carlton has always been famous for its legendary service. The hospitality of "we serve gentlemen and ladies with the attitude of gentlemen and ladies" has won the favor of countless guests. Special thanks to Ashin, the head of the hotel's guest recognition depar**ent, for bringing me considerate, meticulous and surprising services! During the check-in period, Ashin gave me a detailed introduction to the hotel's various room types, restaurants, entertainment and leisure facilities, etc., and patiently answered various questions for me. Through the conversation with Ashin, I have a more detailed understanding of Pudong Ritz and a deeper understanding of the Ritz-Carlton brand culture. Because it was raining and the clouds and fog were too heavy on the upper floors, I finally chose to upgrade to a Pearl Bund River View Suite on a lower floor. The Flair open-air bar on the top floor was reopened on the 17th, and only hotel guests can make reservations, so I specially chose the 17th to stay at the Ritz. It's a pity that the weather is not beautiful, because the outdoor booths are not open because of the rain. Fortunately, around 9:00 p.m., the fog basically dissipated, and the Oriental Pearl Tower finally revealed its full view, and this trip to the Ritz did not leave any regrets. I am not satisfied with the photos I took when the weather was too bad, so I put a photo of Figure 9 before the renovation of Flair last year to recall. During the period, Ashin kept asking me about my stay experience and whether the dishes were in line with my taste. She was very considerate. By the way, their Jinxuan Chinese restaurant tastes really good, and there are many non-seafood dishes. It's very friendly for people like me who don't eat anything in the water. It is really the right decision to use Ritz as the last stop of my trip to Shanghai, because Ritz has never let me down! I also sincerely recommend all "gentlemen and ladies" to come to Shanghai Pudong Ritz-Carlton experience, to experience a group of "gentlemen and ladies" serving you!

Then a room manager came and said that the building did not have heating. Send me a heater! ! ! I don't understand that a hotel with a price of 4500+ (three suites were booked for 4500 per night/room that day) can't even meet the room temperature that an express hotel can meet.

I asked several security guards along the way, but they all ignored me. When I found the hotel staff entrance in the garage, I thought it would be better if I found the hotel staff, but I was in a hurry. After a few words about where the hotel was, we left. When I checked in at the hotel reception, I was told that breakfast time ended at 11:00 am. However, when I went to have breakfast on the 52nd floor at 10:28 am the next day, I was told that breakfast had ended. I was really speechless. The service of this super five-star hotel is really unacceptable! From the lobby manager, receptionist, to security guards, they are all very unprofessional. There is no free parking when staying at a hotel. The Ritz-Carlton in a city is not good. It does not only affect the hotel brand of this city, but also affects the entire hotel's own brand. At least I will not choose this brand!

The double room on the Bund is very big, and the bathtub is also very big. I can watch TV while taking a bath. My baby likes it very much and has been soaking for a long time.
The floor-to-ceiling windows are on the Bund, and the scenery at night is even better than the restaurant on the 52nd floor. Mommy was very happy and took a lot of photos.
The hotel package includes breakfast and dinner. The dinner environment is high, the taste is average, and the service is also high. The breakfast place is a bit hot, and the variety is average.
The Internet celebrity infinity pool is not big, and there are not many people before 10 o'clock, and there are many people behind.
The service is the best, I was considering more options at the beginning, but from the first call, the quality of the service is very good, so it was a good time to stay

When I contacted the hotel the day before check-in, I was told that there was no reservation record. Even the lady who provided the confirmation number ritz said it couldn't be found, and pushed me to Ctrip's customer service. It's hard to imagine such low-level problems appearing in industry benchmarks like ritz and Ctrip. After a series of communication, the lady was very "happy" and told me that I had found the book.
Arrived at the hotel at 3:00 pm on the day of check-in. The guests in the front hall surrounded the small space with water. Shopping..." I can understand waiting for the room, but asking me to wait until 5 o'clock makes me greatly reduce the efficiency of "Lion King".
Finally, let's talk about the hotel's facilities. From the public area to the guest rooms, many places need to be renovated. Although the "Lion King" has many fans, it is still not enough to rely on its own money.

Disadvantages: After all, it is a hotel that opened 12 years ago, so the decoration details are outdated in all aspects. The telephone at the bedside has turned yellow, and even the telephone line is gone. I don't know what it means to be there.
When I checked in, I discussed with the front desk and said, please arrange a room with a slightly higher floor (the guest room is from the 39th floor to the 51st floor). As a result, I got the room card and was placed on the 39th floor. What else can I say? ! When I checked in, I didn't mention where to have breakfast the next day, but I didn't mention the breakfast business hours, but it reminded me that I needed to make up for the difference in the price of children's breakfast...
Checked in at 3 pm, had dinner, Guojin walked around and went back to the room, but I didn't receive the welcome fruit and champagne that came with the room. After I called and asked, I was told: We usually start at 7 pm. The champagne is forgot. Could it be that I misunderstood the welcome fruit? ?
The water temperature of the indoor swimming pool is cold, so it is not suitable for children who can't swim to play in the water.

Dinner: Zhongxuan Restaurant is delicious~~I like it!
Room service: also a bonus. During our dinner, we made a fruit replenishment with us, and the clothes were neatly stacked. The experience was great.
Breakfast: I personally think that the dishes are very rich and delicious hahahaha

2) The bathroom in the room smelled of sewage. The waiter who came to install the tent couldn't bear it anymore, so he took some air freshener and sprayed it.
3) We booked an executive suite with river view, but on the way there that day, the hotel called us and said that we could upgrade our room to a room with a better view (lying on the bed, we can see the river view and the Oriental Pearl Tower at the same time). I just wanted to say that this hotel is very sensible. Then they asked me to add an upgrade fee of 2,000 yuan. I was immediately speechless,,,,, the sales at Ritz-Carlton can be so low.

The only good things are the night view and the swimming pool. It feels like staying at the Ritz-Carlton is like home.

From the moment of check-in, I felt the warm and thoughtful service of the hotel and a steady stream of surprises. Special thanks to Chelsea for carefully decorating the room, hanging HAPPY BIRTHDAY banners and balloons, and giving birthday cakes and snacks. Chelsea and another beautiful colleague also took the elderly to the room in person, and patiently and meticulously introduced the various facilities and usage methods in the room, which made people feel intimate.
For dinner, I booked Jinxuan Chinese Restaurant on the 53rd floor. The restaurant used rose petals to spell out the word 18 on the glass turntable, which was another surprise! While tasting delicious food in the restaurant, watching the night view of the Bund on the opposite bank of the Pujiang River outside the window is a double enjoyment! Here I would like to commend the waiter in the Chinese restaurant for their considerate and thoughtful service. After ten o'clock, he even helped the chef to find a way to ask the chef to make a delicious bowl of birthday noodles, which was delivered to the room, but my daughter forgot to order birthday noodles during dinner. regret.

Let me talk about the advantages first:
1. The location of the hotel is superior, and it is convenient to park under the International Finance Corporation. In terms of landscape, it should be the front row of many landmark hotels in Pudong, and rooms above the 50th floor can get a good view.

2. 🌰The proud service is well maintained. From check-in to check-out, the concierge and housekeepers have shown their due professionalism.

3. The maintenance and sanitation of the room exceeded expectations. Although it has been in business for more than 10 years, there are almost no traces of dilapidation in the room. The texture of the hardware is really good, and the spare parts are also great! In terms of hygiene, the carpet has no obvious stains, and the bedding is quite clean.


Now let's talk about the flaws,

1. The experience of the executive lounge has been severely reduced. The price of the super-basic room type is 1k, but only 50% of the lounge trea**ent. The original standard of five meals a day has shrunk to four. In fact, there had been no new arrivals in Shanghai for two consecutive days when we checked in, and the hotel's adjus**ent and response were clearly not timely enough.

2. After shrinking the administrative trea**ent, the environment is greatly reduced, especially the privacy. Lunch, afternoon tea and dinner are all at Aura. Lunch and dinner can be ordered through the menu, but because it is the same menu, the selection is very narrow, so that We simply gave up dinner on the day of check-in and lunch the next day.

3. The standard of food is really to be severely criticized. If the lunch is worthless, the afternoon tea and the next day’s breakfast are far from those of Grand Hyatt InterContinental, even worse than some old five-star domestic brands. Afternoon tea is small with two floors, which is obviously one size smaller than the standard of Chengdu 🌰 three floors, and the taste is also very ordinary. The variety and quantity of breakfast are simply eye-popping, such as the small pieces of fruit, the freshness and quality are worrying, all in all, the gap is too big!

To sum up, the environmental service of the room has reached the average level, but the food and administrative trea**ent have dropped seriously. Before the executive lounge returns to normal, it is recommended not to spend money to live in the administrative room!

It is very convenient to eat, drink and go shopping. The IFC is downstairs, even if there is a typhoon, you can go for a walk. The mall is unaffected. The check-in experience is also very good. I went up to check in first with my baby. The staff member Ashin immediately noticed that I might need help and gave the baby a welcome toy 🤗Because we need to be on the same floor, the staff also helped me to do it For the free upgrade, thank you very much🙏🏻The environment and service are very good, Morgen Chelsea also provided us with a lot of careful help, thank you very much, I will stay again if I have the opportunity

The location of the view can be said to be very good. You can enjoy the view of the Bund and the Oriental Pearl without leaving the room. The baby likes it very much. Although the hardware facilities are relatively old, the functions are still good. The service is considerate and first-class, and can quickly respond to needs. The variety and quality of breakfast are also good. There is afternoon tea. Unfortunately, the lounge on the top floor has been renovated these days. It can only be used in the coffee bar in the lobby. I hope I can bring it next time. Baby go to the terrace above to have a look. Thank you Chelsea from the guest depar**ent, he gave us a lot of small gifts when he saw us with our baby since we checked in. He also showed us the room. Every time we passed the lobby, he greeted us and our baby warmly and gave them away before leaving. Give the baby a small gift, the baby is very happy, thank you very much. This time it was a very good and very pleasant stay for us and the baby.

With the scenery of the Pujiang River and Chinese and Western food, I will not be disappointed. Sure enough, AURA’s dinner was arranged, and the sunset that caught my eye was beautiful. Red wine and champagne were both slightly drunk, and I had a soft spot for beef tenderloin, which made me look forward to Jin Xuan tonight. Ritz is absolutely detail-controlled, the fragrance at the entrance is like a spring breeze, and the lady at the front desk, Ashin, spoke softly, making us feel at home with the service.

msg:Due to the epidemic, I haven't come to Pudong Ritz for a long time to slow down and experience life. The depression caused by the epidemic has made passersby in a hurry, but the Ritz-Carlton's service staff are indeed enthusiastic. Maybe because of the epidemic, the elevator door from the basement to the hotel was closed, and we needed to transfer from the national finance. Before I got to the door of the hotel lobby, Zacks, the concierge, immediately ran over to help me with my luggage regardless of the heat outside. Thank you very much. Other colleagues in the concierge depar**ent, tony and shawn, also helped me with my luggage. I felt relaxed in an instant. It was not only the luggage, but also my body and mind. When I arrived at the lobby on the 52nd floor, Ethan from the Guest Relations Depar**ent seemed to have known that I was coming. He was already waiting at the elevator door and called my name. It was amazing. Charles at the front desk helped me check in. He was very handsome and very professional. , the check-in speed is also very fast. Ethan also introduced a lot of hotel facilities and equipment on the way to my room, very professional hotel staff! Also very friendly. I am also very grateful to Michael, Ashin, Jessee, Barry, and Morgen from the Guest Relations Depar**ent for setting up the room and handwriting the welcome card for me, which was really attentive. In general, thank you very much. I am very satisfied with this stay. The night view of the Bund is beautiful! Will come again next time! See you next time Pudong Ritz!

msg:👉I haven't been to Shanghai for more than 10 years. After the epidemic was released, I preferred to travel to Shanghai. After choosing a few 5-star hotels, I finally chose the Ritz-Carlton. I booked a twin room with an exterior view on the beach. I was shocked when I entered the room Oh, I did not enter the wrong hotel, in Guangzhou, this kind of decoration and old and new are most hotels.
👎 The first day in Shanghai was minus 4 degrees. As a native of the south, I really felt extremely cold. The room temperature was adjusted to 32 degrees, but it was still so cold that I was shivering. When I asked the waiter to add a heater, I asked why the room was adjusted to 32 degrees. The temperature is still so cold, but she said that I live on a lower floor (39th floor), so there is no central heating,? ? ? , what is this concept? In order to provide one-on-one service to every customer, the IFC Center next to it does not hesitate to keep customers waiting. As a world-class chain hotel, it cannot provide the most basic facilities, but makes customers pay to endure the cold? !
👎The used teacups in the room are never cleaned, the tea bags, and even the toiletries in the bathroom are never refilled. Even the drinking water is added every day after returning to the room and calling the front desk, like a beggar.
😂I have to comment on such a five-star hotel, whoever stays is unlucky.
👌🏻The only advantage is that the hotel is connected to the IFC next door, making shopping very convenient.

The hotel specially prepared decorations, balloons and a small cake, which is just right and not exaggerated and wasteful. The turndown service after dinner is also worthy of praise
Breakfast: The variety is rich and the taste is good. The only regret may be that there are fewer varieties of fruits due to the season, but fortunately, the grapefruit juice that my girlfriend loves is a special bonus. If you want a view by the window, it is recommended not to go too late
Chef Jin Xuan Chinese Restaurant Customized Dinner for Two: I would like to give a two-star Michelin rating! The scenery of Puxi Bund has a panoramic view, and the seats for two people are also very private. The dishes are exquisite and sufficient. The taste is very good (no dish will be rated as average). If you want to do a spa after a meal, try to finish the meal at 20:30 so that you will not be in a hurry.

Thank you very much for the handsome guys and beauties who took care of us during our stay. They were professional, elegant, considerate and gentle, which left a deep impression on us.

The public areas of the hotel are also commendable. The soft and hard facilities in the room and the restaurant are well maintained. The bathtub is spotless. As a hotel that has been in business for so long, it does not make me feel old and old, but precipitated with time.

msg:The first review of the new year must be for the Ritz-Carlton.
On New Year's Eve, a large family stayed in the Oriental Pearl Executive Suite and several adjacent rooms. The location and scenery were all excellent, with pictures and facts.
From 6:30 am to 11:30 pm in the Ritz Executive Lounge, snacks and fruit drinks are always available. From the afternoon tea after check-in, swimming, fitness, and connecting the suite and the adjacent room, the middle-aged people will play mahjong, children will play games 🎮, the elderly will watch the Spring Festival Gala, they will take what they need, and go upstairs to eat and drink when they are hungry. Wild eyes, no joy. IFC and Binjiang downstairs can also be reached by raising your legs, which is really convenient.
The facilities are not as good as new hotels, but the service is excellent. At breakfast on the first day of the new year, the little girl gave me a latte, a heart, really caring!
happy New Year to all!

It is to help my mother celebrate her birthday. After placing the order, the lady at the front desk and the lady at the executive lounge will meet the needs, arrange birthday decorations, and send delicious cakes!
Because of the rights and interests of the executive lounge, you can fully immerse yourself in eating, drinking and watching the river view. The scenery on the 49th floor is very good. It is on the Bund viewing platform, and you can see the buildings of the world!
In the evening, I arranged longevity noodles for my mother! and beautiful flowers! Mom is super happy! All the staff will say happy birthday! Really good service!
Had lunch the next day! The little brother gave us fruit tea because we liked He fruit tea very much! There are also small gifts! Very memorable! Very thoughtful! Mind MAX! Afternoon tea was arranged in the afternoon! There is also a sea salt thick milk latte specially prepared by Miss Sister! And dirty coffee! Great, great! Worthy of being an executive lounge👍
🌹Thank you to everyone in the Executive Lounge! Cynthia! Ruby! Ethan! Sylvie! Kiki! Lychee! The attentive service of everyone makes my mother very happy! Woohoo! Thank you for creating such wonderful memories! I wish you all the best ❤️

The executive lounge treats guests very warmly, serving your favorite drinks, and afternoon tea will be served on a double-decker. The happy hour menu is also varied, including freshly made pasta. The best executive lounge among many five-star hotels.
It is also a good experience to walk through the gym, swimming pool and sauna of the skyline in the clouds.

First of all, the check-in efficiency is very slow. I understand that there are many people on Sundays, but just check-in takes a moment. Zhong, and then the champagne and fruit in the room were urged three times and four times. At first, it was said to be delivered at six o'clock, but it was not delivered until after ten o'clock in the evening... Dinner is useless. There are relatively few things to choose from. The room facilities are relatively old and small, and the exterior scenery is not as good as expected. There are not many types of breakfast, and the coffee is too bad... In the whole hotel, only the mirror is perfect, and the others are really lame... Don't come here, everyone

msg:I got the certificate with my boyfriend (now husband) and wanted to choose a hotel to celebrate and commemorate, and finally chose the Ritz. It turns out that my choice was correct, and the anniversary choice for the two of them is really good here!

Two days before the trip, a lady called to confirm the trip, and helped me to use the package benefits to upgrade the Pearl View Room and make an appoin**ent for the SPA time. I took the initiative to confirm with me whether it was a memorial day, and proposed a free arrangement. grateful.

Check in in the afternoon on the day of the trip, and the front desk is very polite. Although it was the first time, the unfamiliar environment did not create a sense of distance, and the experience was very good. Ashin from the Guest Recognition Depar**ent led us into the room and served with a smile throughout, thank you Ashin.

When I entered the room, I saw the elaborate arrangement of the Ritz, the balloons and the words Happy Wedding. The champagne in the package was iced, and a small dessert and welcome fruit were presented. There is also a handwritten letter, which is very caring and I like it very much, so it is also a beautiful souvenir to bring home.

I went swimming at night, probably because the temperature difference between indoor and outdoor is large at night, and the glass windows of the swimming pool are foggy and cannot enjoy the night view. The heated pool in the pool is very comfortable. The gym next to it is useless, but the view from the gym window is still great!

Breakfast in the morning, there are quite a lot of varieties, the small wontons are delicious, and the hotel's homemade yogurt is more impressive, and it tastes good. Having breakfast by the window overlooking Lujiazui is an unforgettable experience.

In the afternoon, I went to experience the Ritz SPA. Unexpectedly, the highest light of this journey turned out to be here. After taking a bath, wait in the women's lounge where you can drink tea, read newspapers, and have snacks. The SPA takes about 60 minutes, and it is very comfortable to fall asleep. Personally, I think it is slightly better than the experience of the SPA in Banyan Tree Huangshan. Until this time, I was really impressed by Ritz's service, impeccable.

Because the SPA waiting time was too long, which affected the check-out time, the front desk also helped to do a late check-out. When I left, I saw Filly, she arranged the room for us, thank you very much! Filly also gave us two room cards as souvenirs, which was really touching.

Although it was only two days, it made me feel the meticulous care and service, which left us with very good memories. I will consider coming to the Ritz on the anniversary in the future, thank you again!

It has been several days, so I asked the hotel staff why they didn't explain it in advance when I checked in, so that I couldn't see the Oriental Pearl in the room with a view of the Oriental Pearl, but the Oriental Pearl was not under their control, and they couldn't answer, I I want to know if it’s just the Ritz-Carlton, or if Marriott’s hotels are all such disgusting customers. I remember that Marriott’s service attitude is okay. I’m sorry that I often talk about it, and I can finally give a satisfactory way to deal with it.

It is not new, but you can feel an elegant and heavy feeling, and the services in all aspects are comfortable. The geographical location is superior. It is only separated from the Oriental Pearl by a human-shaped overpass. Next to it is the National Financial Center of various luxury goods. It is a 5-minute walk from Tomson Yipin.

msg:Taking advantage of the school season, my mother and father wanted to take my younger brother to travel at different peaks, but my father did not have a long vacation, so he could only stay in a hotel in Shanghai. We chose the latter among Banyan Tree and Ritz, because of the infinity pool and ifc’s delicious food. Arrived at 11:00 yesterday morning, left the luggage on the first floor, went to the checkin on the 52nd floor, and asked the front desk to call us when there was a room. There were so many people at the scene that every elevator was crowded. Later, I found out that it was the company's annual meeting. Lao Jin said that the company is so rich, does it still recruit people? At first glance, it is Soochow Securities, the brokerage is really rich, and they cut our leeks to eat, drink and have fun [Disappointed R]
After checking in, we went to ifc for dinner. The Jiangsu and Zhejiang Associations went in without queuing. All the brokerages were having dinner together. The food was served very slowly. My brother starved to death. After dinner, I called back to the hotel and still had no room. I went to the ifc to buy coffee, and then went back to the hotel. It was 3 o'clock, but there was still no room. Because the brokerage checked in and checked out, my aunt didn't have time to clean it, and my brother was very tired. I discussed it with the front desk. , and later helped me to upgrade the executive room on the 51st floor (I ordered a normal deluxe room package). It was a little hot to sleep at night, the air conditioner was 24 degrees, and the air conditioner was set at 24 degrees. I was afraid that my brother would catch a cold without covering the quilt, so I could only do this. It was the first time my brother slept with us after confinement. Go, get up in the middle of the night and chat with us, we haven't slept all night, this kid is a little tricky. After having breakfast in the morning, we went swimming again. I remembered that the room I booked had a 500 yuan meal coupon and a free 30-kilometer car delivery. I asked the front desk so that I could go to the restaurant and choose a cake to take home. The car that sent us was Gaohe. It was the first time I made a high-tech car, and my brother was very happy. The overall experience is still good. It would be better if there were fewer people. The total consumption is 2271. I hope everyone can experience it.
The overall hygiene is good, the swimming pool is very clean.
Some parts of the room are a little old, but the invincible view has saved a point.
Although the passenger flow on the day was very high and the service team was a little tired, they gave priority to meeting the needs of the guests, which is a benchmark for a five-star hotel.
The air conditioner in the room is really dry, the mouth is dry, and I don't know how to solve it.

msg:This is a hotel with better hardware, bathroom is a feature. Hygiene is considered to be good among the many five-star rooms I have stayed in. There are dust accumulations in some places where the rooms are not often used. Many hotels have it, which is considered an average in the industry. The environment is also good. The service is quite satisfactory and well-trained. Why is it given mediocre? It is because when checking in, it seems to only focus on training staff to guide customers to make second consumption. It is not aimed at staff, she just implements it, because I am from Shanghai Guojin almost every week. Go, the familiar restaurant has been booked, so there is no food and beverage consumption in the hotel. When I checked in, I told us that there was a child staying in the room, and there were only two pairs of slippers in the room. The front desk also took the initiative to ask me if I had a toothbrush. I said no. Auntie went to ask for a pair of slippers and three sets of toothbrushes. This is not in place. When I stayed at Shangri-La Hotel last time, they took the initiative to prepare special products for children, and I felt much better. Quick check out. Finally, I would like to make some suggestions. The high-end luxury hotels that Ctrip have booked in many countries have more or less similar room upgrades or free parking or child benefits. This hotel has nothing. I don’t know if it is his unique arrogance. The welcome fruit looked cheap and stale and untouched. There is another detail. Once we went to the door of the room and saw a hotel employee coming out of the room. We were stunned for a while. They didn’t care if they said they were delivering fruit. ? It feels that the room can be freely entered and exited, which is not very safe. The parking fee is 96 yuan per night, please be aware.

It took an hour to communicate and waited indifferently. Fortunately, Ctrip kept the original order. After checking in, the hand was caught by the sliding door without any warning signs, and the front desk sent someone to take a look. Wow, this sense of service is unique. It is stated that you can check in at 3pm. Finally got a room at 4:30, got another room at 4:30, speechless, no wonder there are so many bad reviews, it turned out to be justified!

msg:Not to mention the location, it is really convenient to live in this hotel and go shopping and eat in Guojin. However, there is a fee for parking 🅿️, and there are no discounts and free bills for guests. (The ceiling of 96, because it is parked in a place in the IFC mall, consumption can still be deducted from the parking fee)
  Check-in on the 52nd floor, the Italian restaurant is also a place for breakfast. Let me tell you what I am very dissatisfied with. On Ctrip, I made a reservation at three o’clock. The actual situation is that when I checked in, I kept saying that the room was not good enough to recommend me to upgrade to a king-bed view room. I did not agree (actually arrived at the store) The time is about 3:30 in the afternoon), and then the staff said that it might take a while, but we went to Guojin to go shopping, and the phone time was 4:50 when we were notified that we could check in.
  It was my birthday on the day I checked in. It is common practice for star-rated hotels to give guests a small cake. There is no harm in it. The Ritz-Carlton presents cookies similar to cranberries. . . It may seem petty!
  There is a cloakroom at the entrance of the room, and the double bed will not appear crowded. The separation of dry and wet and double basins are now standard in star-rated hotels, and a large bathtub is also essential. (It's a pity that it's not a smart toilet)
  The Bund opposite is full of charm after the lights are turned on, so paying for it is worth the fare.

msg:This time because it was my birthday, I chose the Ritz-Carlton after careful consideration. I chose the skyscraper view room type, which can see the Global Center. The size of the room is also satisfactory. It is worth mentioning that I am very satisfied with the stay. The hotel The staff is very considerate. A young lady named Ashin helped me choose a room with a very good view in the same room type. She carefully led us into the room, and then sent a birthday cake and fruit from the hotel, and asked If you have any questions, please contact her at any time. It can be said that the feeling of staying at the Ritz-Carlton Pudong is very good. I also had a very happy birthday and had a good time at the Ritz-Carlton. I sincerely recommend it to everyone!

msg:Once, the Ritz-Carlton was the No. 1 hotel service industry in my mind. Ritz, who has lived in cities such as Sanya and Shenzhen, has always had a good feeling. I lived in this Shanghai many years ago and I think it should be very good. Unfortunately, the feeling this time is still slightly flawed.
good aspect:
1. At the time of check-in, Ronaldinho’s service was warm and thoughtful. Knowing that I had checked in and applied for a membership card, he upgraded my room type and was warm and polite, and the staff in the lobby helped to carry the bag to the room and said "Welcome back." "It makes people feel warm.
2. The hotel's concierge service is meticulous, because I bought a package that includes a 30-kilometer car service. From the first call for consultation to the last reservation for the car to Hongqiao Railway Station, it was very intimate and enthusiastic. The pick-up car has personality and sense of technology. I was a little far away from the hotel when the car was delivered, and the hotel still asked the driver to pick me up at my designated destination and then send me to the train station. This is very thoughtful and thank you.
Talk about the bad feelings:
1. Room service, I returned to the room at night about 22:30-23:00, found that there was no toothbrush and toothpaste, etc., I called the front desk, and waited for about half an hour and didn’t deliver it. Then I urged it for the second time. Delivered. I don't know if it is insufficient manpower or what is the reason.
2. According to my previous impression, I still think the hotel's breakfast is very good. After this experience, I feel that the standard has dropped a lot. Especially in the Ming Dang area of Chinese dim sum, a bowl of small wontons was boiled so badly, the egg crust was cut very thick, and the bowl used to serve was also very inappropriate. This bowl of small wontons is probably the worst hotel breakfast ever. Produced.
There are not too many people in the breakfast area, but I feel that the service is not in place, there are no tissues on the table, and it is difficult to get people at the close. The guests at the table next door were also complaining that the coffee that had been waiting for a long time was not delivered.
I hope that the quality of related services and breakfast can be improved to maintain the consistently high standard of Ritz-Carlton.

She learned that her daughter had just finished her postgraduate entrance examination. She gave a chocolate cake 🍰, a little lion 🦁, and a bouquet of flowers 🌸 for her daughter. I wish her a bright future. If the retest passes, continue to live for a few days. The swimming pool is divided into two pools with different water temperatures. The breakfast is a rich and delicious combination of Chinese and Western. The three-piece suit and the Oriental Pearl can be seen from every window in the room, swimming pool, restaurant, and gym.

I asked if I needed to wash my teeth. I also told me to prepare two copies. However, no one sent me at night, and no one answered the call to the front desk. The hotel for more than two thousand nights does not even have the most basic front desk service, which is really a bad review. Never stayed in a hotel where there is no free parking. Is it because you are in the land of every inch of land? Hehe, please forgive me for being a countryman who has never seen the world

I have already cleaned up and can move in. Thank you Candice for preparing in advance. At the same time, I also gave the children a tent. The children liked it very much.
After checking in, Evelyn took to the room to introduce her, and when she entered the room, she saw her carefully arranged room, because she brought two children and two kid bathrobes of different sizes, which fits our two children. At his age, he also presented cakes and chocolates.
When checking out, I also helped push the luggage to the downstairs. Thank you Candice and Evelyn for the pleasant staying experience on this wedding anniversary!

msg:The location and scenery are first-class. The room facilities can be seen to be old but well maintained. If there are any inquiries, they are solved quickly. The top flair has a good view and good service. The service is very good and fast when checking out. The whole experience is OK. It can be praised, but it is a small problem that makes it very unpleasant.
I came directly from Shangri-La next door that day. No one took my luggage upstairs at more than three o'clock in the afternoon. I dragged my suitcase to the front desk to check in. The lowest floor of this room type is 39 floors. The front desk gave a relatively low floor 41st floor. It said that there would be handrails in the bathroom. When asked if there were high floors, they said no. These are not big problems and can be accepted.
The key is here. The front desk clearly said that the welcome fruit will be delivered in a while. Okay, then I will go to the room and wait. There was no movement until six o'clock. I called the front desk to ask when the welcome fruit would be delivered. As a result, the first sentence of the front desk on the phone told me that there was no welcome fruit. The room type booked did not have welcome fruit. Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me? When checking in, I just said that it would be delivered in a while, and now it is gone? Then I said directly that it was clearly stated in the reservation, and it was also said to be delivered in a while when checking in. As a result, the front desk immediately changed the words on the phone and said that it would be delivered at 6:30. What is this? Do you treat guests like **? How much is a welcome fruit worth? Isn't it enough to just say that it will be delivered immediately? Why do you say that there is no welcome fruit in the reservation? Is this how you serve? I will definitely not give a good review for this reason. My good mood for the whole day is gone. And the tissue box should really be replaced. The old one is almost rotten.
If you are a fast hotel, it doesn't matter. Is it worthy of the name of Ritz to do such a thing as a welcome fruit?

msg:This time I stayed at the 🌰 hotel in Pudong, the magic city. I chose the executive room and experienced the administrative courtesy.
Although the arranged room has a good view, because the temperature in Shanghai is still hot in the past two days, such a high floor is bound to be grilled by the scorching sun. Unfortunately, the air-conditioning in the room is also very weak, and it can't beat the high temperature, even if it is adjusted to 16 degrees, it is choking. So one point is deducted for facilities. However, the equipped bathtub is very good, as shown in the picture, it can sit and lie down, and it can be ranked in the top three among various five-star hotels.
Let's talk about the administrative courtesy. Check-in and check-out can be done on the executive floor, eliminating the trouble of queuing. Five meals a day also adhere to the Ritz's consistent style, and the quality is basically online. The evening meal when I checked in this time was freshly made sarat, which was full of food and delicious, I need to like it. But it is estimated that the chef is from Southeast Asia? Boneless chicken feet are also curry? Can it be delicious? 2333
The hotel’s breakfast is pretty good, but since there is an executive lounge, why isn’t the executive floor equipped with breakfast service? There are some in Puxi, and I still like a dining environment with few people and no noise. I hope the hotel can consider this suggestion.

The decoration of Ritz is relatively old, but definitely, there are several kinds of river view rooms, one is the Bund river view where I live, and the other is the Oriental Pearl River view. The big ball is next to it. There is also a luxurious suite on the first floor, sitting on the Bund and the Oriental Pearl Tower, which is invincible and spectacular.

The layout of the rooms is very good. The double basins are arranged on both sides, with a retro-style bathtub in the middle, which is very Shanghai style. The sofa is by the floor-to-ceiling windows, and the river view is unobstructed. The sunset is particularly beautiful.

The turn-down service delivered fruits, and I came back late and didn't eat any food. The breakfast room is close to the Oriental Pearl Tower. The restaurant is compact and rich in ingredients.
The bar may be an online celebrity check-in point. Make an appoin**ent in advance, or you can give the room number to the front desk, and you will call the room if you have a seat.

The service is very meticulous. When I didn't know how to choose a room at the beginning, the front desk specially showed me to the room.

msg:The Ritz-Carlton is a mess. I had already paid for the room when I booked online. It was a normal procedure to register at the front desk and pay a deposit. However, after the guest checked out, the staff mistakenly deducted the deposit as the room fee due to a staff error. After leaving the hotel, I discovered that there was a problem with the hotel. I received feedback that the finance depar**ent would arrange a refund, but after five hours of delay, I called the hotel again and asked me to discuss the hotel’s financial procedures. It would take ten working days. I was really angry. Although the Ritz-Carlton was not considered a refund, Top-notch, after all, it is still a well-known brand hotel, but with such a working attitude and method, don't they know that he is illegally detained? Don’t you know that this nature is worse than picking up other people’s things and refusing to return them? If I call 110 to warn them of illegal seizure and take the police to the front desk, where will their faces be? We are a local company in Shanghai and receive a large number of customers. We have stayed in almost all hotels in Shanghai. We have only encountered such service problems twice at the Ritz-Carlton. Once was at the Jing'an Temple Ritz-Carlton. I also gave a negative review. In today's society How can such a superior service still exist? Is this how employee training teaches them to treat customers and their own mistakes? However, I later realized that Ctrip’s customer service attitude was very good and they understood my feelings very well. Anyway, I would never book this hotel again unless the customer requested it.

Ritz’s breakfast is quite good, hearty and delicious, and the double-concentration capp's garland is very authentic. No matter the breakfast room, bar or the view of the room, there is nothing to say about the swimming pool. In addition to the landscaped heated pool, the hot spring pool is also awesome! At the same time, it is convenient to visit IFC downstairs, and I will come again when I have a chance. My son is already in love with it🙂

The breakfast is very rich, but there are a few points that are not satisfied: 1. When I checked in, I did not tell you that you can dine on the 58th floor, just said Western food on the 52nd floor and Chinese food on the 53rd floor. 2. The breakfast coffee burned my mouth twice. My boyfriend's cup was warm, and I thought mine was too. The result was hot coffee, and the waiter didn't remind me. 3. I ordered the afternoon tea of 588, and only arranged for us at the bar counter. Obviously there are still a lot of vacant seats, but it is said that they cannot be seated if they are reserved.

I ordered a skyscraper view room. Unfortunately, it rained heavily that day and the visibility was discounted. But I feel that if there is no fog, it is not a problem to see Lujiazui Trident under normal circumstances~
The only regret is that the breakfast was a bit. . . To be honest, the breakfast is really average, I'm a bit sorry for the price ~ others are very good!

Then, because of the typhoon, I stayed in the hotel and couldn't go out. The ladies again sent us small gifts and hand-painted cards. The two children in our family looked like painted on the cards.

msg:In order to celebrate the joy of the party for a hundred years, take the children to experience and feel it. But the check-in process at the hotel is the longest and the worst experience in the hotel ever. There are only three staff members to check in. The waiting time in line and the processing time are long. The breakfast is very mediocre. As a high-end brand under Marriott, it's really a bit tacky. There are two doors in the guest room. I don’t know why. It seems that I was given a connecting room, and then it was divided into two rooms and sold...Oh, bad! When I assigned the room, I didn’t explain it. I just wanted to stay for one night. In short, the experience was really bad. It is still in the most prosperous central area of Pudong, Shanghai. No matter how good the location is, no matter how the decoration standard is, and there is no supporting service, it is worthless in the eyes of customers. This kind of experience makes people live once and never want to live a second time. Come to Ctrip again. The first time I booked a room where the locked price cannot be changed, the hotel told me that I did not see my order. My order was not booked through Ctrip? what? ! The 5600+ suites booked by friends also include the executive lounge coffee break, including parking fees and other services. The standard room with a double bed of 4900+ has nothing. Never pay attention to the package content. There is also this difference, I feel that this kind of order instantly makes myself low burst. Ctrip's distributor cooperation model makes the customer experience really bad. Generally, I don’t like to make evaluations, because there is rarely such a bad experience...hehe...

The experience is that the hotel is really a little bit old, a little smaller, and the landscape is poor. A little bit. But the service is really good, especially the handsome guy Trayvon at the front desk who checked in and helped me upgrade the river view room for free. awesome! And the hotel is really quiet, with B&O speakers, it feels like home. Breakfast is just average. The taste is nothing special, the desserts are beautiful, and you can take pictures. Oh, by the way, you don’t have to go out on rainy days. It’s cool to go directly downstairs to visit IFC. If the wallet is big enough, it will be even cooler!

The room is troublesome, you can continue to live in this room if you say that you can continue to live in this room. I checked again and again, and the lobby manager said that there are guests who are willing to pay the original price, so you have to move out. I think it is ridiculous, and she promised not to change the room. How about it? I think it’s terrible. There will be such a hotel and a manager like this will affect the development of the hotel too much. I spent more than 10,000 yuan to live in your hotel in exchange for such a service.

大堂經理態度還不錯，帶着看了幾個房間直到我們滿意，另外還送了下午茶。換的江景房，整體入住感覺還可以。

酒店樓下就是ifc國金中心，購物、吃飯、打車都非常方便。58樓的頂樓酒吧可以俯瞰黃浦江夜景非常值得一去，非常火爆要提前預約。
酒店的jessi小姐姐也特別好，給小朋友準備了小禮物，有求必應且應得非常快。還有打掃衞生的楊春鳳阿姨看到我洗了襪子，就給我準備了一瓶藍月亮洗衣液非常貼心。
一次非常愉快的入住體驗，下次還會再來。

msg:整體環境和設施沒得説。之前住過一次讓人難忘，因此特地再一次選擇在這家酒店來度過大年三十。
但是，這一次入住感覺甚是不滿，值得提一下：
定的是外灘景套房，在check in時被前台強行安利好幾遍行政套房，問了一下，不是免費升級，需要補差價，所以説了不需要，還是又被再問“確定不需要嗎”。。我想説我要是真需要的話，在訂房的時候就定了，這又不是免費升級，一直給客人這麼推銷，感覺很差，也給人一些酒店生意可能不太行的感覺。
退房時落下了一支la prairie的洗面奶在淋浴間，隔了兩天想起來，馬上打電話給前台詢問和求助，之後前台回電説客房這邊反饋沒有任何東西落下。這個反饋簡直讓人覺得可笑至極又生氣。東西是很肯定落在淋浴間沒拿，因為重視所以都打了電話給前台詢問了，但前台和客房都説沒有，能怎麼辦？這種可以怎麼投訴？這種事，既然是落下了東西，如果要證明自己丟了東西肯定很難證明，衹能靠酒店員工的素質和服務了，但是反饋的結果？可想而知員工素質。
最後，相比較而言，餐飲部的服務非常出色，早餐在麥片牛奶裏發現一根頭髮，這種情況很常見也可理解，所以衹是和服務員簡單告知和反應了一下，沒有提出其他任何要求。但讓人意想不到的是服務人員前來很認真解釋，可能是頭髮飄進麥片裏或者其他可能，希望理解這樣的情況，並且已經把所有麥片全都換了新的，最後又贈送一個小香薰致歉。這樣的服務態度非常專業。
可見，該酒店的員工素質參差不齊，從整體來看，對於這樣的酒店，有失水準。

感謝Fiona妹妹為我定製了易烊千璽卡通版剪影房卡，還為我準備了入住甜品和水果。
浦東麗思卡爾頓的房間還挺大的，且景觀很不錯👍，會經常來體驗的

入住前一天酒店賓客關係部的Lena專門打電話來確認行程，詢問賓客情況。瞭解到這次我們入住是為了慶祝我的生日，並且帶着孩子，馬上會意，承諾安排好孩子需要的用品，並且贈送卡片蛋糕，我已經相當滿意了。想不到入住房間後，推開門一看，還專門佈置了氣球拉花。蛋糕卡片水果更是擺放整齊。
登記入住的時候，發生一個小小誤會，客户認知部的經理Ashin真誠道歉，馬上解決問題，並且想盡辦法彌補小小的不愉快。在離店的時候還主動找到我們，詢問我們的住店感受，送給我個性定製的小禮物還有給小朋友的紀念禮物，衹是希望我們有個愉快的住店經歷。在上海浦東麗思卡爾頓入住的兩天一夜裡，經過每個地方，都會有員工祝我生日快樂，這樣誠意滿滿而且用心的服務，在世界各地的五星酒店很難再碰到了！我心悦誠服！謝謝Ashin經理的真誠細心的安排。
這樣好的服務，我一定要廣而告之。☺️
設施：很好，餐廳客房游泳健身都很棒。
衞生：乾淨！
環境：就是為了看陸家嘴外灘的景去的。樓下直接連着國金中心，吃飯購物休閑都很方便。
服務：上面已經有説明瞭，真的很棒。真誠，用心。

  1.   硬件方面：淋浴房的水龍頭沒法固定，非常影響洗澡。房間空調開啟時有濃郁的下水道異味，後來使用空氣凈化器消除異味。首次在麗思遇到這種硬件出問題的情況。
  2.   軟件方面：早餐用餐還未結束，服務人員就守在餐桌旁邊收碗，甚至拿走還在使用的碗碟，體驗感很不好，希望酒店注意。

msg:不知道是不是大霧天氣居然用2000+的價格定到了樓層景觀很好的房間，四天的上海出差之旅換了三家酒店，價格都是在2000左右，服務來説的確是這家最好，景觀是因為酒店幫我做了刻意選擇，以致於設備老套真的被景觀所覆蓋。總得來説還不錯，來上海玩的鐵子們，與其花1000多用兩個小時來吃飯看景觀或者花幾百一個人上高層觀光，不如訂這家景觀房，真的可以

衞生：從一樓接待廳到52樓空中大堂，整體氛圍都能讓客人感覺很放鬆，很整潔乾淨，香氛的味道很舒服，客房內每日衞生打掃徹底
環境：酒店坐落於陸家嘴國金中心，臨近東方明珠及外灘，房間內就能看到“三件套”。夜幕降臨，在房間內就可感受到至高的視覺盛宴，燈光很好看。酒店設計將老上海及現代都市風格相融合，能感受到鮮明的地域色彩
服務：作為萬豪國際的忠實粉絲，很高興這次入住浦東麗思卡爾頓酒店，從到達、辦理入住、前往房間，每名服務人員都很熱情積極，房間內還提前準備了歡迎水果及小點心，整體給客人提供了很不錯的入住體驗
一些小建議：希望以後酒店工作效率可以再提高一些，入住時間沒必要非要卡的很精確，當前退按金流程較繁瑣滯後，希望可以簡化

msg:其他都合常規。就是早餐廳，讓人感受不佳。因為五一期間，怕人太多，讓老公提前去找座位，等老公找到位置，我們其他人再去吃早餐。到達早餐廳，報上房間號，被門口前台接待員告之，電腦顯示這兩個房間已在用餐，我立刻解釋了原因，是我老公一人提前佔桌，我們母子三是後到。前台不接受我這個理由，又問我你們到底幾個人用餐？這個房間顯示已在用餐！我説我們兩房間四個人（包括小孩），餐廳裏衹有我老公一人，加上我們母子三，共四人！前台依然不信，又問你們到底有幾個在用餐？我説二個房間4個人！前台依然不信，讓旁邊另一個服務生去查看，裏面倒底幾個人在用餐。服務生去查人數，裏面確實是我老公一人坐在4人桌上才讓我們母子三進去用餐！這麼幾個來回，作為客人的我們感覺特別糟糕！覺得被如此懷疑和不信任！我出行都選國際五星，衹是因為喜歡這些酒店的理念！對客人，首先是信任和尊重，而不是先懷疑再證明清白！一個三千加每晚的高端酒店，覺得自己的住客都是去薅羊毛，佔便宜點，吃白飯的人。讓人不可理解，也讓人失望！平生第一次遇到！好感全無！

flair員工有點參差不齊：點的雞尾酒不好喝，反饋後來的第一位態度很不好，甚至沒有認真瞭解為什麼不滿意，衹是急着讓結賬？？後來過來了2、3位，才出現願意調整、能把酒説明白的。
中餐廳掛着米其林，但服務和口味一般。
前台辦理業務的速度，實在是前所未見地慢，不論哪位接待、什麼時間段、入住續住都很慢，非常浪費時間。
美中不足吧，酒店還會去。

感謝行政酒廊Cynthia（如果寫錯名字見諒）的優質服務，正值太太生日，在酒廊用餐時被送上長壽麪的那一刻覺得很幸福，酒店用心的服務，讓我們在旅途中感受到了賓至如歸。
酒店地處浦東核心區，可以步行去東方明珠、上海中心大廈，此外酒店與國金中心連通，逛街購物非常方便。
在行政酒廊靜謐恬適的氛圍中，一邊欣賞外灘摩登夜景，一邊品一杯美酒，與家人聊聊天，能夠讓人徹底的放鬆，我想這就是我們旅行中最好的狀態。
此外，房間很舒適、餐點很豐盛、每一位酒店員工都會熱情禮貌的招呼，我想這就是最好的硬件、最舒適的服務、最優質的酒店。
假期結束了，但我對下一次體驗更加期待，希望早日再次相見。

來説説酒店的優點吧。地理位置優越，夜景極佳，出行也非常方便。床品很舒服，智能馬桶也很棒。游泳池還有一個小“温泉池”可以帶孩子玩耍，真的太加分了！以至於入住第二家酒店後孩子仍對卡爾頓念念不忘。早餐中規中矩，但勝在環境，坐在窗邊欣賞着美景心情大好。如果非要提出一點不足那就是吹風機需要升級一下，高層要不要考慮配備戴森呀：）

3、酒店的早餐在52層大堂旁邊，中西結合，比較豐盛，環境氛圍也很舒適，應該是離東方明珠最近的自助餐廳啦；酒店的泳池在53樓，一大一小，可以看到黃浦江和“三件套”，小的小童池水温蠻熱，孩子游泳玩水，大人就當泡澡啦。
