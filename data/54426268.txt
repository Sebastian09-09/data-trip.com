msg:A very good holiday experience! We arrived in Hemu just during the Mid-Autumn Festival. After experiencing a 16-square-meter room in Kanas that was falsely reported as 35 square meters and no way to complain, I felt like I was in heaven! As soon as we were about to arrive in Hemu, they began to guide us on how to take the bus and how to plan our time. They also helped us plan dinner in advance and carefully prepared free Mid-Autumn moon cakes. The two girls, Xiao Zhai and Jinjin, were very considerate and patient. Thank you for your arrangement, which allowed our group of five to spend an unforgettable Mid-Autumn Festival! The room is also very comfortable, with three rooms and a living room, which is very suitable for family travel or a small group of 5-6 people traveling together!

msg:I booked the hotel long in advance. When I took the through bus to Kanas, I also had a Xinjiang meal in Kanas Old Village. With the comparison, I must say that the chefs in Xirong are better! Whether it is Xinjiang cuisine or northern cuisine, the taste and ingredients are very good.
As soon as I entered the room, the floor heating skirting humidifier was turned on, and it was warm. There was also a welcome fruit plate, snacks every night, and the hot water for bathing at night was also stable. Usually there is nothing to say about these, it is what it should be, but after reading other tourists who stayed in Hemu on Xiaohongshu, I felt satisfied 😂 Fortunately, I booked here, otherwise I might...
On the last day of the trip, the autumn scenery also came, and it finally started to turn yellow. Everyone is rushing to Kanas now, just in time! hhhh

Location: The B&B is in the new village, without the hustle and bustle of the old village, very suitable for friends who want to experience the courtyard of Hemu quietly. Their courtyard may be the best maintained in the whole village, a colorful sea of ​​flowers, plus the cabin and the mountain behind, this is not a paradise! And it is very close to the Hemu River, just a few steps away, you can go to the riverside plank road to walk around, there are few people and beautiful scenery
Service: The B&B has its own coffee and restaurant, you can order in advance, and the breakfast is delicious. The staff is also very friendly, answering all questions and responding to all requests. Because I have to walk into the village, the staff helped me pick up my luggage from the transfer center, which solved a big problem for me, which is really great
I hope I will have the opportunity to experience Hemu in winter next time

msg:The cabin, which cost 6867 yuan per night, is not worth the money. Although the interior is simple and clean, and the facilities are normal, the price is very high and the service is basically non-existent. After we checked in, a tour group also came to stay. The waiter said that because they had to accommodate the tour group, they postponed our dinner and asked us to find a restaurant elsewhere to eat. Maybe the waiter felt bad and said that he would arrange for us to have breakfast before the tour group at 8:30 the next morning, but at the agreed breakfast time the next day, he asked us to wait until the tour group finished eating before eating. So we had very little breakfast food left and there was nothing to eat.

The breakfast and dinner at the B&B are very delicious. They have Xinjiang characteristics and also take into account the tastes of us southerners. I booked dinner at the B&B for both nights in Hemu. It was delicious! The old village is quite lively and there are many restaurants, but I prefer to eat quietly with my family! There is a small wooden door in the garden of the B&B. Go in and walk along the wooden plank road to the viewing platform. The scenery along the way is amazing. You can also see wild mushrooms in the forest! The ladies and brothers at the front desk are very enthusiastic. If it weren't for their reminder, I might have missed the starry sky and the Milky Way in Hemu at night!

msg:Facilities: Xirong has the best supporting facilities. It must be reasonable to choose it first on the list. The day before I stayed in Xirong, I stayed in the most expensive Yunding Pavilion in Kanas for 8,000+ and booked 2 rooms, which cost 17,000 yuan in total. To be honest, the scenery is really shocking, but the supporting facilities are not very good. The most important thing is that there are too many bugs to kill. Xirong is much better. I think the scenery is second. Comfort is still more important. Otherwise, you won’t be in the mood to live and how can you feel the nature better? Hahaha... It depends on what everyone likes. , the new village is quieter, the old village is a bit lively, people who like to hang out can go there, there are all kinds of people, it's more mixed I don't like that, and it feels unsafe, and those who plan to go to Hemu must be careful not to drive an electric car across the Hemu Bridge, the caravan will forcibly pull out the keys, it's unreasonable, and finally alarmed the police, just like **, the ethnic behavior is very strong, the Hemu Bridge is in the old village, so I like the new village, and the Abin Restaurant in the new village is also delicious, and the proprietress and boss of the electric car rental are very enthusiastic, they are all in the new village, whether the people are good or not is in their bones, I will come again in the future!
Hygiene: Very clean, complete supporting facilities, there are sweet watermelons in the store, and there are also beverages and beers in the refrigerator, and the juice wine is super delicious. Only the equipment is fully automatic, and this price is really OK
Environment: The environment is beautiful, quiet, and gives people a very relaxing feeling. It is very beautiful to take pictures around
Service: The service is nothing to say. I chartered all the cars in Kanas and Hemu without doing the shuttle bus. It is not convenient for the elderly and children to carry a lot of luggage. In Kanas, I asked Yundingge B&B to call a chartered car for 3,500 a day. In Hemu, I asked Xirong to call it for me for only 1,500. They said that Kanas and Hemu only cost 1,500 for a whole day! This is the difference, alas! The next morning, I asked the store to help me charter a car for a one-way trip and send it out for only 500. It was so touching. Some people just make money for the sake of making money. This kind of business is a one-time business. I am also a businessman. I evaluate it seriously. Before leaving, I gave Xirong a positive evaluation. It is the best here, hahaha, I like it and can help everyone

msg:Service: The service is extremely poor. It is the worst five-star hotel I have ever stayed in. The price of 7,000 yuan a night can be said to have no front desk service, which is even worse than that of ordinary express hotels. It only enters the guest's ID card information and does nothing else. The hotel is in the new village in the scenic area. Self-driving vehicles are not allowed to drive to the scenic area. They can only take the bus and then transfer to the bus in the scenic area (there are very few buses to the new village. We waited for 0 minutes before the bus left, and the accommodation and transportation were particularly inconvenient). The hotel never took the initiative to contact me from beginning to end to confirm the check-in date and tell me how to get to the hotel, such as which bus to take, which stop to take, and how to walk to the hotel after arriving at the stop. According to other comments, the hotel can help pick up and drop off luggage, but when I contacted the front desk to ask about the route to the hotel, the service staff never mentioned that they could help us. After our family walked a long way with large and small bags, the front desk told us that they could help pick up and drop off luggage. There is no appearance and level of a five-star hotel, and it is not as reliable as a battery car that costs 30 yuan an hour. When booking a room on Ctrip, we reserved welcome fruit with points, but it was not provided until we came back from playing in the evening. The explanation given by the front desk was that the fruit was replaced with dried fruit, but it was never informed in advance. After reading the check-in instructions, the dried fruit is brought by each room, which is completely different from the fruit we requested on the platform. The attitude of the front desk was extremely poor, the reply was perfunctory, and we were asked more than once whether we "needed" fruit, and did not fulfill the requirements confirmed in the order.

Environment: There is no essential difference from other cabin environments, the vegetation in the yard is messy, and you can even see empty cigarette boxes on the wooden plank road and handrails, which is completely unrelated to high-end hotels.

Breakfast: It is edible and coffee is provided, but the variety of food is very poor. The so-called Chinese and Western breakfast only has bread slices and steamed buns.

The only one star is given to the kitten in the yard. It is friendly, well-behaved and cute, and I don’t know how much higher it is than the hotel service staff.

管家的服務可以説是比較禮貌但是比較流程化沒有真的為顧客着想的感覺。廁所有問題也衹想打個哈哈敷衍過去😊3k一晚的房費真的不應該有些關懷向的服務意識嗎？
菜品倒是還可以。送到房間也挺好。位置比較偏。衞生也還可以。如果想住現代化一點的民宿可以考慮這裏。但是相比價格需要做的還有很多。
