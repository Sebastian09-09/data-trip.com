msg:Excellent location right next to two big malls. There’s also a coffee street very near by. The fitness suite was very well equipped. My favorite part was breakfast. They had a variety of western and Cantonese options. This is probably the best hotel breakfast I’ve had for a long time. I only gave amenities 4 stars because they didn’t have a children’s playground. But overall it’s been a good visit.

The check in was fast and the staff are friendly and helpful with our things. We requested a room with a view and a crib. Requests granted!  Fantastic! We ordered lamb chops for dinner. My wife loved it. Breakfast area was not that warm so the food gets cold quick. Overall it was excellent. Thumbs up

msg:Facilities: Although the hotel is a bit old, it is well maintained. There are charging piles in the underground parking lot, which is good. But there are two flaws. First, the big bed is made of two single beds. Second, the bathtub in the room is a bit cramped.

Hygiene: The overall hygiene is well maintained. There is a small flaw that the room is a bit damp and smelly, and the fragrance in the public area is very sufficient, which leads to a big contrast when entering the room.

Environment: The hotel is very quiet. The most important thing is that the lake view of Qiandeng Lake is great and unobstructed.

Service: The service is very considerate. Give a thumbs up, the concierge at the gate clearly guides the location of the charging parking space. The service staff at the front desk who checked in were also very kind and the introduction of the hotel was also very comprehensive, which is a good comment. The room also prepared a bedtime dessert, which was very thoughtful. The hotel gave a good evaluation in terms of service, which made up for the shortcomings of the hotel's long age and made people feel good overall.

As an InterContinental brand, the price of this hotel is relatively good value for money. I believe that it will be perfect if there is a chance to renovate it after a while.

🛏【️Foshan InterContinental Hotel Check-in Guide】

📌 Hotel Overview

1. Comprehensive evaluation (highlights, shortcomings, regrets): In addition to the two-day carnival on site (Tanya Tanya, Click#15, Doudou, Landlady’s Cat, Houhai Shark, Rejuvenation Pill, Laowang Band, Mosaic, Peace Hotel, Wutiaoren...), the sons also met many artists or bands participating in the Foshan Strawberry Music Festival at the Foshan Poly Intercontinental Hotel. I have also hosted Mr. Turtle and Pu Shu’s performances or concerts many times. It can be regarded as the continuation of fate to the next generation. In fact, Foshan has a very rich cultural and entertainment a**osphere, and whenever they come to Foshan, most of the hotels that artists choose to stay at are Foshan InterContinental. This trust is the greatest affirmation of the hotel and needs no elaboration.

🏨 About the room In Room

1. Welcome gifts and upgrade benefits (whether the trea**ent is good or not): Welcome fruits are plump, welcome desserts include Cantonese sweet soup, egg tarts, etc. Welcome gifts include blind cakes, portable charging cable sets, etc.

2. Room layout and hardware evaluation (whether the room is big or not): I was upgraded to an open-plan suite every time. This time, because I had children, I was given an extra car-shaped children's bed (with Jeju Island Mason Glad Hotel The children's room is very similar), full of sincerity.

3. Minibar and bathroom accessories: Provide a full set of children's bathroom accessories.

☕️ Dining

1. Hotel breakfast types and services (good or bad): There is a members area, and Diamond Ambassadors have exclusive freshly squeezed orange juice;

2. Hotel restaurant hardware, taste and service: Sugar Cafe is opposite the all-day restaurant. It has outdoor and indoor areas. The quality of coffee beans is better than that of the lobby bar. It is recommended that Diamond Ambassadors come here to redeem the welcome drink. Strawberry Music Festival musicians often take away coffee here, which shows that it has a good reputation.

🏊 Hardware Facilities

1. Hotel environment: The decoration is grand and there is a free tennis court, similar to the Crowne Plaza Guangzhou Center, but the latter is charged;

2. Gym and swimming pool (new): There is an outdoor swimming pool. Once again on the vernal equinox, soon the water will stop getting cold and you can have fun.

3. Children's entertainment: Because we stayed in the same hotel, my younger son, who was practicing drums, had the opportunity to take photos with teachers from the tour group, turtles, second-hand roses and other bands and learn about their drum practice experience. He received selfless advice from his seniors. , are unparalleled wealth that other hotels cannot provide.

🌟 The Moments

1. Highlights (advantages and shortcomings): At present, excluding specialty B&Bs, the top seven hotels in Foshan prefecture-level cities are: Sofitel, The Tribute Portfolio, Haijunda Hilton, Midea Marriott, Hilton, Dongping IC and Foshan Intercontinental, in terms of price, this IC is obviously the first choice for cost performance. Currently, there are 4 IHG hotels in Shunde: one each for InterContinental, Holiday Inn and two Smart Select hotels; there are two IHG hotels in Chancheng: one each for Crown and Smart Select; there are currently no IHG hotels in Sanshui and Gaoming; and there are 3 IHG hotels in Nanhai. : Intercontinental, Crown and Holiday Inn each have one. Since the Strawberry Music Festival is held in Nanhai District, most of the band members stay at the Poly Intercontinental Foshan. For the two sons who love rock music, it is really great news. They stay in the elevator, in the breakfast room, and in the coffee Hall... You can meet idols unexpectedly anytime and anywhere.​​​

2. Outstanding performance and awards for star employees (whether the service is strong or not): Ms. Li, the duty manager, and Camellia and Kitty in the executive lounge are enthusiastic and responsible. They helped us arrange every detail for us. We recommend those small hotels that are not very popular to stay in the hotel. If you want to change your career, please learn from the employees of Intercontinental Hotel Foshan, who can be regarded as role models in the industry.

📍 Brief summary Conclusion

1. Highlights of the trip: I have stayed in this hotel 14 times, this is my 15th time, and I have feelings for it. In terms of size, this hotel is larger than Dongping Intercontinental. This hotel has 445 rooms, while the latter has 330 rooms. In terms of hardware, the latter is obviously better than the former, but fortunately they are all owned by a Chinese owner, so the wealth does not go to outsiders. When everyone moves in, they can get what they need according to their own actual conditions. For example, many people value Poly Intercontinental. Because its location is so good, right next to Foshan’s landmark Qiandeng Lake, you can experience Guangfu Wencun, Lingnan heritage, or even a loyal fan of Huang Feihong. Here, you can realize your dreams.

2. Surrounding food, attractions and entertainment: The hotel is located in the bustling Guicheng Street, which is full of fireworks. Next to it is Wanda Plaza, Nanhai National Fitness Plaza, and Changgang Park. The Huanyu City 2.5 kilometers away is full of delicious food. Friends with phobias can also choose this hotel. Will find a home quickly.

Facilities: The room facilities are really old, and the glass has not been cleaned for a long time, which wastes the view of Qiandeng Lake. There is a very unpleasant smell when you enter the door. There is no coffee machine in the room, and the bathtub drain is broken. The maintenance is very poor

Arranged on the same floor, upgraded to a larger suite with a great view, my parents are very satisfied! The hotel's dinner buffet is cheaper than a certain group, and the Chinese restaurant coupons for Chinese food are given to guests. It rained in the next few days, so I didn't go to the surrounding area to explore the food. In fact, the hotel's food and beverage are also very good after the coupons are given.

The hotel breakfast is very good, with rich varieties and delicious. It is very close to Denghu West Street, which can be reached in ten minutes on foot. There are many delicious restaurants. Even if you don’t go to West Street, there is a large shopping mall next to it. There are many places to eat on the 4th floor. It is very convenient. We went to have morning tea at noon the next day. It tasted good and the price was affordable.
In short, InterContinental is the first choice for eating in Foshan.

This time I came to Foshan to play during the off-peak period. The transportation is convenient, and it is also very close to Qiandeng Lake for a walk at night~ Qiandeng Lake is just outside the window, which is very beautiful~ The children shouted that they would stay at InterContinental wherever they go in the future, haha. I was attracted by the breakfast when I went out to play and stayed at InterContinental many times before, which was very satisfying for the children, haha. I am still satisfied this time~ and the breakfast environment is beautiful and the layout is very attentive~
The room is the same InterContinental style as always, and I am also satisfied~
Thank you again!

The room is clean and tidy, drinks are available, and the bed is comfortable, but it would be better if there was a harder mattress option. The view outside the window is nice, you can see Qiandeng Lake and West Street.

Because we were traveling with children and mothers, she upgraded us to a suite and added a baby bed. There was also a thoughtful bedtime dessert at night. The hotel has an excellent location, you can see Qiandeng Lake Park, and it is also close to Denghu West Street. The breakfast is quite rich. The hotel is decorated in the old money style. The only drawback is that the big bed is a little shaky. It is recommended to check the facilities in the guest room.

Because the room facilities were relatively old and the curtains could not be lowered when I checked in, the front desk immediately upgraded me to a suite and gave me administrative benefits.

msg:During the long Easter holiday, a family of 10 chose the Poly Intercontinental Hotel Foshan for their vacation. The hotel is located in the middle reaches of Qiandeng Lake. It is also very convenient for eating, shopping or visiting the lake to enjoy flowers.
As one of them had a birthday, I called the hotel earlier to arrange a birthday cake. The hotel also gave a free cake to the birthday guest to celebrate his birthday.
It is worth mentioning that there is free red date and wolfberry water in the hotel lobby, which is refreshing and delicious. Ms. Wu Lewen at the front desk of the hotel was very polite and professional. She remembered us as a three-day and two-night guest and made various arrangements for us. We had a happy Easter.

Since we enjoyed the buffet breakfast for two days, we felt that when there were tour groups, the supply and selection of the buffet breakfast became limited, and we had to trouble the manager to find us a seat. We had to wait until there were no tour groups on the second day before we could enjoy various delicacies such as instant rice rolls and instant porridge.

msg:The first person I want to express my sincere gratitude to is a male waiter named Liang at the front desk who helped me successfully use my mobile phone to book high-speed rail tickets from Traditional Chinese to Simplified Chinese late at night. The second person was a young man from the concierge who seemed to be named TIMI who helped us find a place to store our luggage near the Ancestral Temple Lingnan Tiandi. He was not only attentive, but also called the other party to make arrangements. He also wrote down the address and phone number in detail for us to find. Finally, he smiled and watched us get in the car and say goodbye. His service attitude is really rare. This Poly InterContinental Hotel is really lucky to have these two young staff. This hotel is in the financial center, with a great location. The overall environment and hygiene are really good, and the room layout is good. The breakfast quality is better than the famous hotel street in Guangzhou that accepts foreign guests. Only the Chinese restaurant on the third floor is not worth a try.

The room is overall good. The only small drawback is that the water in the wash basin is very slow. It is easy to accumulate water after washing your face. I hope it can be improved. What is particularly worthy of gratitude is that because it was the day before Chinese New Year and I got drunk with my family, I communicated with the front desk to ask for a slightly delayed check-out, and they also gave us enough time to clean up.
The overall stay experience can be given 5 stars.

The breakfast buffet is great, with so many varieties, it’s comparable to the lunch buffet! I also received a 100-yuan shopping voucher for Florence. It is said that you can also take a taxi back and forth to the town for free, which feels like a good value for money! Thumbs up to Miss Lisa, she has a great attitude~

msg:Although this store opened very early, it is very cost-effective and deserves to be the first choice!
Service: I went to the front desk to check in that afternoon because there were a lot of group guests that day. Then the lady at the front desk took the initiative to upgrade my room type. I was really happy. It was the first time I met InterContinental who helped me upgrade my room type. I can only say that I exceeded my expectations. Thank you to her. She is a beautiful woman. In addition, because she accidentally broke her skin, she ordered takeout and asked the guy in the lobby to help deliver it to the room quickly. Thank you to the guy. The overall service is very good👍
Environment: 1. The guest room is still very clean, and the room is very square. There is no smell of smoke. Although it has been open for a long time, the various facilities are a bit different from the newly opened ones, but the room is large and very nice, so people don't care at all. 2. Next to the hotel is Qiandeng Lake, which is great for walking at night. The environment is also very good. There is also food in the hotel. Along the river, you can also go to the shopping mall a few hundred meters ahead to eat. There are a lot of food. 3. The hotel is not far from the town of Florence and it is worth taking a taxi to visit. The transportation is also okay, it is about 800 meters away from the subway station.
Cleanliness: The guest rooms are very clean, the beds and sheets are also tidy, and the corridors are very fragrant.
Facilities: The hotel has a swimming pool. Unfortunately, I couldn’t experience it without a swimming cap. I must try it next time I have a chance.
Experience: I caught up with a celebrity concert in Foshan, and the hotel room prices didn’t increase much. It was very conscientious. The breakfast was also good, including Cantonese style and Western style, and the variety was okay.
I am still very grateful to river and camellia, and the guy who helped me deliver medicines to the room.

The hotel is not new, but it is well maintained. The executive room I was upgraded to was very clean and looked new. The area is very large, and it is difficult to accept a small room now.

Zoe added me on WeChat that day and helped me solve the problem throughout the whole process. She was very patient and enthusiastic. She even gave me sugar water and egg tarts in the evening. Like!

Went to the executive lounge for afternoon tea in the afternoon, the view was nice.

It was indeed a very pleasant experience. I will stay at Intercontinental again when I come to Foshan in the future.

The location of the hotel is very good, right next to Qiandeng Lake. After dinner, I walked around Qiandeng Lake and walked back to the hotel.
However, the sound insulation is a bit poor. There is a linen room next to the room. Occasionally, I can hear sounds. Forget it. I don’t know why: at 10 o’clock in the evening, in the room with sealed windows on the 27th floor, I can hear people shouting for night running training. "One two one", I walked to the window to make sure it was coming from the ground, but there was no one else.
There are not many varieties of breakfast, and the taste is quite acceptable.

It is very convenient to go for a walk in Qiandeng Lake. It is just downstairs. Like it. The hotel opened in 10 years, and it has been more than ten years. The hardware is relatively old, but you can still see the intentions of the original construction, but there are some problems with some cabinets in the room, and they need to be maintained. The biggest problem with the room is that the sanitation is relatively average. Although the facilities are relatively old, sanitation is a big problem. The surface of the table in the living room is covered with dust (photos will be attached below). I hope the hotel will pay attention to it. The hotel swimming pool is an open-air swimming pool, and there is no way to swim when the weather is bad. The hotel breakfast is good, but the number of waiters is not enough.

Guests staying at the hotel can visit and take photos with their room cards. The design is Lingnan exquisite retro style. Imagine if the weather is cool and you can sit here and drink tea. It should be very comfortable. It’s still too hot during November and there’s no one there.

The first two photos were edited for posting on WeChat Moments. The colors look fresher. The second two photos are closer to real colors.

The room overlooks Qiandeng Lake. Our room window faces north. Looking at the map, I guess that the room on the west side should have a better viewing angle.

We consulted on WeChat before and after check-in. Thank you Kitty and Zoe for their considerate service and patient answers.

This time the service from the executive lounge staff was still impeccably good! Jaina and Lisa prepared executive trea**ent and room supplies for a family of three before check-in according to my needs. Welcome fruit & drink coupons, festival moon cakes, afternoon tea fruits & moon cakes, and evening sweets & dessert surprises! The arranged room 3710 is newly renovated compared to August. It has a reasonable space layout, comfortable sofa and dining table, sufficient electric sockets, and a view of the lake and food street. I am very satisfied! A small regret is that the exhaust switch in the bathroom is broken. The water vapor lingers all night after a hot shower, and the stone floor is wet and slippery.
What I hope the hotel can improve is: 1. The quality of toothbrushes, toothpaste, toilet paper, tea bags and coffee bags in the rooms should be upgraded to intercontinental levels. 2. The Western snacks, dinner dishes, late-night biscuits and other varieties in the executive lounge this time are not as good as those on August weekends, which is a bit disappointing; there is no buffet lunch during the holidays, so consider extending the buffet breakfast time to 11:30 or even 12 o'clock to divert guests and enhance the dining experience.

The location is good, it is very convenient to go to Qiandeng Lake, and it is very close to the West Street Night Market.

msg:I was looking forward to staying for the first time, and I was extremely disappointed! The front desk clerk is an intern and has no sense of service at all. He called the front desk in advance and told the front desk to put the takeout on the ground at the front desk. He insisted on enlarging the takeout cabinet outside the door. A five-star hotel doesn’t even have a robot, and it doesn’t provide food delivery service , The front desk is rigid and throws the blame to the delivery guy, it's speechless. There are charging piles marked on the hotel. When I called and asked, there were only Tesla charging piles. I drove the tram around to find a place to charge. Please don’t write it on it to mislead people if you don’t have the strength. The only gratifying thing is the breakfast restaurant on the 36th floor. The environment, dishes and services are all good. Compared with the front desk on the first floor, they are completely different. This is the first time I write a negative review for a hotel. In short, the experience is very poor and I am very upset

Before I checked in, I called me to ask about my housing needs. Icey, the welcome ambassador, specially received me when I checked in. We are warm and professional, the room scenery is beautiful, and the night view is even more beautiful. We have nothing to say. When we checked out, javing received us and gave small snacks to the children. The family is very happy. It was a good experience. We will visit again next time.

As soon as you walk into the lounge, you can smell the exclusive fragrance. The taste memory is awakened. The lounge Located on the 36th floor, the view is wide and the scenery is pleasant. The staff in the lounge have sweet smiles and sweet voices. When they learned that we are coming to Foshan for vacation, the manager of Yalan enthusiastically introduced the nearby attractions and restaurants. The western restaurant on the first floor is also newly decorated in a very good style. Trendy, suitable for taking pictures and punching cards, we also enjoyed a romantic sunset in the lounge at night, a journey worth remembering.

The shower rod in the shower is fixed and cannot be adjusted. One end of the shower is wet, the shower gel is dirty, and there are water marks left by pressing it out on the side. It looks really dirty. The makeup mirror is very old. I think the matching toiletries I live in a hotel... What I can't accept the most is that there are no sockets next to the front of the mirror! There is no place to plug in a curling iron. There is only one side of the bed with a socket, and the other side does not. It is really the least intercontinental hotel I have ever stayed in.

The hotel lobby is tall and comfortable, the bedding in the room is clean and brand new, the room is spacious, and the door is very thick so the sound insulation effect is very good. It gave me a quiet resting space when I was away from home, which is very good. The view outside the window happens to be the central axis of Qiandeng Lake, which has a wide view, and the development and construction around it is amazing. The speed of development in Foshan is amazing. What moved me the most was the executive lounge on the 36th floor of the hotel, which not only provided a very superior place for business negotiations It also provides a self-service afternoon tea, especially the friendly service of the staff wendy Zoey & amy, which makes me feel like a spring breeze. This is the standard configuration of software service level and hardware facilities unique to world-class hotel groups. It made me feel more joyful during this short journey. Next time I come to Foshan, I will continue to live in InterContinental Poly.

Disappoin**ent: 1. When I came back at night, I found that the toilet was smelly. A smelly toilet, the whole process can only use the living room toilet. 2. The breakfast was taken to the small hall without any explanation. There were few types of food and the quality was average. The Samsung breakfast was visually appealing. The small hall was dimly lit, as if eating breakfast in a spare room. After eating and asking, I realized that the hall was full, so I took it to the small hall. But it was not informed in advance. 3. After checking out, I gave a small cosmetic bag as an apology gift. When I got home, I found that the zipper was broken, which was very embarrassing and left a deep impression.

On the day of check-in, the check-in efficiency at the front desk was very high, especially a girl named Maunam, who was very professional and had a good attitude. On the same day, I upgraded to a one-bedroom suite on the 33rd floor. The room was very spacious and comfortable, with the beautiful view of Qiandeng Lake outside the window. The toilet in the bathroom is equipped with a washlet, which is comfortable. The afternoon tea and happy hour in the lounge are not too crowded, the meals are exquisite and delicious, and the service is very timely. Breakfast is on the 6th floor, with rich choices, delicious taste, and great service.

I went to the outdoor swimming pool in the morning. Because it was at room temperature, the water was still a bit cold. It was almost a private room, and the experience was perfect.

Generally speaking, the InterContinental in Foshan is very online, and Qiandeng Lake and its surrounding areas must be the first choice for five-star hotels.

This is the first time I encountered this kind of situation in InterContinental, and it was only when I went to bed at night that there was a problem, so I was speechless.

Room: Free upgrade to a high-rise lake view room upon check-in. The room layout is no different from what the hotel introduced. The scenery of Qiandeng Lake Park is unobstructed, especially the lights at night are quite beautiful.
Facilities: As a hotel of this level, the facilities are definitely not bad. There is a small problem that the handle of the bathroom faucet switch is very short, and it is not convenient to switch it on and off. Especially the shower, it's too tight to adjust the water flow (because the water temperature is not too high).
Service: The service attitude of the staff encountered is very good.
Overall, I am quite satisfied with the hotel!

The service at the front desk of the hotel is also very warm, and there are special fruits and red bean paste snacks prepared in advance, which are very considerate~ The overall rest is also very comfortable. The quality and service of InterContinental are still the same as before. I will continue to stay for two days. Recommended~

When we checked in, the waiter Chen Ying quietly helped us upgrade the lake view room, which surprised us a bit (the window of the room faces Qiandeng lake view). Other waiters are very patient to answer the guests' questions. There are many commercial streets near the hotel. The next time I visit Foshan, I will choose this InterContinental Foshan as the first choice.

Sure enough, I received a contact from WENDYX pig pig the day before I checked in, and thoughtfully arranged a birthday cake, a good room location, and always pay attention to my feelings, hoping to give me a happy, happy and unforgettable birthday~ Really , this trip is great~ I am so happy, so happy, so happy~ I hope that WENDYX pig pig will go to another hotel in the future, and tell me as soon as possible, and then experience it again, hahaha

Other additions: The service is really good, but the hardware of the hotel is too old ~ needs to be updated. Secondly, the restaurant is not good, I am sad, and I have diarrhea, and I have two meals in a row.

Summary: 5-star hotel, 5-star service, roadside restaurant

msg:I used to be a platinum ambassador member of InterContinental, and I am very familiar with the service process of InterContinental, but InterContinental Foshan Poly Hotel still gave me a surprise in the Chinese New Year. First, CC Wu, the hotel's guest relations director, asked about the check-in itinerary the day before check-in, and patiently introduced the hotel's anti-epidemic policy, because I am a family staying in two rooms, I thought that policies other than Ctrip packages would not be enjoyed anymore. The rooms on the same floor are arranged to facilitate the care of the elderly and children. Welcome gifts are given in both rooms. What is more surprising is that CC sees that the five of us are old and young, and they give an additional breakfast (the original package only included Double breakfast), and let the elderly and children enjoy a pleasant trip with peace of mind. When checking in, Ms. Chen at the front desk also gave my boy auspicious keychain for the Year of the Tiger, which made the child happy to say thank you. The five welcome drink coupons also gave the family a good time to relax after dinner. From check-in to check-out, CC's caring care has made us more comfortable in the latter part of the Spring Festival holiday. Although I am no longer an ambassador member, but if I really want to reopen the ambassador after the epidemic, I will choose CC and Foshan Poly Intercontinental!

I received a call from the hotel asking for the hotel's accommodation needs. to a room with a lake view. When checking in at the front desk, the beautiful lady at the front desk was very nice and informed that she had helped to upgrade the lake view room. I was pleasantly surprised. The lady at the front desk was warm and courteous, and the lobby layout also had a Spring Festival a**osphere, with a strong New Year's flavor. The floor-to-ceiling windows of the room are facing the Qiandeng Lake view, especially at night, the night view of the Denghu Lake is bright and beautiful! The hotel service is really in place, taking into account the sleep needs of the guests, there are a variety of different functional pillows to choose from, less than 5 minutes after I press the express phone, the room attendant will deliver the cassia pillow to the room. The hotel's buffet breakfast is rich in variety, Chinese and Western dishes are optional, the noodle soup made to order is delicious, and the ingredients are very fresh. Although I only stayed for one night, the hotel environment is elegant and luxurious, the rooms are quiet, and the service is attentive, leaving a good impression!

msg:InterContinental's service is getting better and better. I am very grateful to soti for their thoughtful service before and after check-in. Knowing that we were looking at the lights, we specially arranged the lake-viewing room on the highest floor. There is also a great a**osphere during the Chinese New Year. There are lions and the God of Wealth giving out red envelopes, and clowns tying balloons for children. The gym is also very good, the equipment is readily available, and the service is considerate and warm. Although the room is not big, the spaciousness is acceptable, and the bedding and bathrobes are pretty good. Although there is no constant temperature swimming pool, but the flaws do not hide the beauty, I am still very satisfied. It is the first choice around Qiandeng Lake. You can bring your baby to pass the time in summer. There are also playgrounds and cinemas in the shopping mall next to it, so shopping and eating are no problem.
A little advice: after the buffet is seated, it is best to have a sign indicating that other guests have been seated. In addition, there are many places in the hotel. You can expand the children's playground, even if you charge a fee, to make up for the lack of constant temperature and children's pools. After all, the parent-child market is bigger.

msg:During the Spring Festival, I took 4 elderly people on a trip. Because of the epidemic, I chose a hotel that is 20 minutes away from Guangzhou by car.
The service of the hotel is really thoughtful and considerate! After booking a few days ago, a hotel staff member named Wendy contacted me in advance. Since the elderly I brought with me asked for a bit more, they wanted a twin room and hoped to see the scenery. Among them, the elderly even asked for a hard bed. All the staff were satisfied. Speaking of the room price, it is also worth it. Each room is given a meal coupon of 500 yuan, a total of 1000 yuan of meal coupons. In the Chinese restaurant on the 3rd floor, you can eat almost without paying a penny until you get out of the wall. Every product is the same. All are exquisite. The breakfast options included in the room are also quite rich, and there are many Lingnan-style breakfasts. The only small disadvantage is that each bed in the twin room is a little too small, but it doesn't affect the old people's praise for the whole hotel at all. The elderly especially praised the bathroom facilities in the room!

The room is really old because of its long age. The sound insulation is very poor. The music played in the restaurant and bar nearby is clearly introduced into the house at night. The 30th floor can't be soundproofed very well. The first night's check-in was almost at 10 o'clock before it was a little quieter. Called the front desk and no one came to check the situation. It is estimated that he received too many complaints and was too lazy to respond. The morning tea on the 3rd floor is more conventional, and the price is not high for this price, so it is convenient

The family came to feel the feeling of home! Children’s things are configured, and the details are perfect! Because the family came to play and wanted to experience seeing Qiandeng Lake from a height, Soti and Lliy not only met my needs, but also upgraded one of the rooms to a larger suite for free to give the children a stretch of space! The service is not only attentive but also attentive. The staff trained by this hotel are very good!

Soti Yang, a professional customer service supervisor, helped follow up the whole process. As far as possible to help me deliver the meal to my room according to my schedule, thanks to the rib-eye steak and sirloin steak recommended by chef Tang Zhenqi. Chef Zhang Xiaorong’s fruit salad is delicious, and the steak goes well with the salad! The room also has birthday decorations for guest room staff Yu Qianmei and Yu Yanmei. Everything was prepared just right~ What's more surprising is that Soti predicted my prediction and brought me red wine! I wanted to bring it, but I forgot, it's a wonderful coincidence wow hahaha! In the end, the concierge Jenson delivered the cake to the room on time, and I am very grateful for the meal and ice cubes delivered by James. Mia and David at the front desk check in and check out very quickly! The perfect day has finally come to an end, and I look forward to a surprise trip in the future ٩(♡㉨♡)۶ ٩(♡㉨♡)۶

msg:This is the worst Intercontinental I have ever stayed in. When I entered the room, there was a strong musty smell and a big moldy stain on the roof. I asked the front desk to put us an air purifier, which was barely better.
The washbasin in the bathroom is actually tattered. This is a facility that InterContinental and Express Hotel would not be so broken.
The curtains were also stained and in tatters, and they were not shading.
The cleaning was poor. I went to the lobby and ordered a lunch. The lampshade on the table was covered with a layer of dust.
There is a good service attitude, but I will not come again. It's really bad, I have never lived in such a bad InterContinental.

Many recommendations. I ordered the morning tea in the Royal Mansion on the third floor of the hotel. The morning tea in the Royal Mansion is very authentic. The restaurant vivi has a warm service. Knowing that I am an IHG member also helped me get a discount.

But there is a small suggestion. The hotel has been around for so long, and some facilities and equipment need to be repaired or replaced. The TV is a bit green and snowy.

msg:I have been to Foshan several times, and for the first time I chose to stay at Poly InterContinental located in Qiandeng Lake.

Welcome: The details are not comprehensive enough, and there is no door opening for greeting.

Lobby: I checked in at 12 o'clock, and Mavis checked me in, without queuing. The whole process was smooth. Mavis's business dream is very strong and very familiar with the business. Since I am an IHG gold card member, I was given two beverage redemption coupons.

Room: It is arranged in the smoking room on the 31st floor, which meets the basic needs of smokers. Compared with other hotels of the same level and price, it is only about 3***, which is not big. The shower room and toilet area in the bathroom are narrow, and the design is obviously to make more space for the room.

Location: The location is quite good. There are large shopping malls within 500 meters of the hotel, and all kinds of restaurants are available. The surrounding traffic is relatively small, and with the blessing of Qiandeng Lake Park, the air quality is quite good.

Royal Mansion Restaurant: The preferential package is 128 for guests, and 3 dishes are optional, which is very cost-effective. The product and taste are also good, but the serving time is quite long, nearly 35 minutes.

There is room for improvement:

1) The TV screen is obviously damaged and has not been replaced.

2) The bath set is not replenished, so the waiter will replenish it later.

3) The sensor in the bathroom, I personally don't like it.

4) The bed is a bit soft, which is a bit waist-breaking.

5) The fruit for gold card members is 3 apples (unlucky, more like worship). Other hotels generally mix several fruits. This is what I am most dissatisfied with. The hotel needs to pay attention to this issue, and I hope I won't be disappointed again next time.

Summary: As a senior hotel stayer, I can only give 8 points out of 10. It's basically a matter of details. I will choose to stay next time.

The hotel service is very user-friendly. Knowing that I have come for the first time, I can experience the free upgrade to the lake view room. The room arrangement is very satisfactory! Thank you Soti for your concern. I didn't have time to see the lion dance culture recommended by Soti this time, so I must check it next time I have a chance! I feel that I have been cared about staying in the hotel for the first time. This is my first business trip to Foshan and I have a great impression of this city!

msg:性價比不錯的酒店，預訂後就行政酒廊Kitty就聯繫了我，瞭解需求並贈送兩份糖水，這個還是蠻有佛山特色的。到店後Enya又給我們做了房間升級，可以俯瞰千燈湖，有點小驚喜。總體不錯吧，硬件確實略微老了，牆上的電器口大部分都沒電，還有就是清明假期人多，客房服務略微遲慢，不過價格還是合理的。

設施：比較陳舊，款式因人而異算經典吧
衞生：這點要多説，房間的味道和很多評價一樣，要麼濃郁的香薰味，要麼一股黴味，我覺得兩者都有，因為有黴味才要用10支香薰棒放在書桌上，我建議是繼續放着與其一股難聞的味道，我選擇被香味薰暈
服務：服務這款還算可以，但是早餐的款式比較少，體現在同樣的菜，這裏普遍用最簡單的煮法，味道不功不過。

1-日常需要鍛鍊，結果看到健身中心器械也比較有歷史感，就沒有特意留時間去了。
2-房間設計比較舊時風格，比較適合出差居住，度假就不要了。
3-重點！！衞生真的需要大力提高，枕巾有種沒有晾乾的發黴氣味，米白的防滑墊一打開是黑色黴點，着實有點嚇人和失望。
4-隔音不是很理想，半夜12點過後還能聽到過道整理物品的不小動靜（不是租客路過説話的那種）。

msg:酒店對不起洲際酒店的牌子。請避坑。感覺酒店就一棟建築，沒其他的配置，也沒景觀好看，地段也很一般。感覺洲際酒店集團現在越做越差。房間裏面設施陳舊，裝修風格應該是15年前吧，棕黑色為主，充滿便捷酒店的低端味道。800-1000這個價位，我感覺不值。還不如住個好一點、新一點的快捷酒店。唯一好處是有一個户外泳池，還有健身房。
對了，吐槽一下，辦理入住真的很慢，很費時間。

msg:因為一句吃在順德，我們兩個家庭就決定從廣州回家之前，要在佛山吃個兩天，因為帶着孩子，所以想選擇一個高檔乾淨清爽的酒店，選了好長時間才決定選擇保利洲際酒店。談談自己的切身感受吧，選擇酒店的時候其實沒什麼特別的期待，但是酒店工作人員的服務，真的讓我們感受很棒。來酒店的前幾天，工作人員會和我們聯繫，確認入住時間，人數，已經有無特別的需求。這裏得實名制贊一下酒店的工作人員Jaina和May，到酒店之後會親自陪着我們兩家辦理入住，考慮到我們的情況，給我們升級到了套房，給我們兩家各送了一份甜點。整個入住和入住前的感受，給我們兩家人的感受非常棒，就是賓至如歸的感覺。當然了，還是那句話，吃在順德嘛。沒想到這一點酒店都會考慮的，專門給我們提供了順德的美食攻略，細節到店名、地址、車程、特色、飯店定位等等，説實話這個我是最驚喜的一點，兩天的時間我們按照上面的攻略打卡了一些飯店，不得不説，順德沒白來。最後一天晚上玩的太累了，我們就在酒店旁邊的夜市逛了一下，走路五分鐘，我們住的房間就能看到，從樓上看感覺不大，但是親自去感受一下，我去，非常大，非常有市井氣息，好多好多吃的玩的，主打的就是一個近。以上是我這次來佛山的感受，感謝佛山保利洲際酒店的工作人員，感謝佛山的招待。我們還會再回來噠。。。（這裡有迴音）哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈

入住前，前台酒廊的鄭經理給了歡迎電話，客房需求都得到滿足。五星好評

不唯二不足是客房除了廁所衞生紙，竟然連房間抽紙都沒有。 過於樸素了。

早餐廳的取餐動線好混亂，冷熱牛奶離了好遠。 果汁和水果也分開，根本找不到。  需要改善。

msg:我很少會點評，這次我來客觀的點評一下。因為職業原因，每次出行都會選擇五星級酒店，對於酒店的各方面都算是要求蠻高的，這次入住佛山保利洲際其實是有些失望了。硬件：1、房間較為舊，雖然有翻新過，但傢俱、浴缸、淋浴房等方面仍然能看出來不符合五星級標準；2、電源開關、插頭佈局不合理（明顯是以前的佈局）兩個牀頭櫃，櫃子上方衹有一個有插頭，另一個牀頭櫃沒有插頭；3、電視沒有投屏功能：4、沒有窗簾，用的遮光板。這讓我很難受，因為我睡眠質量非常差，一點透光我就會醒，以至於天一微微亮，兩邊遮光板的縫隙透光到房間（而且本身遮光板不是百分之百的遮光），我需要的是關燈後全黑的狀態；5、酒店噪音問題，有部分樓層再施工，房間須知明確了施工時間，但是早上8點開始敲敲打打，真的受不了，被動吵醒；這都讓我對洲際大打折扣！減分！
但值得我點讚的是酒店的服務！確實加分了！前台小妹妹們熱情待客；特別值得表揚就是禮賓司Tony，從入住第一天我的投訴開始就跟的很緊，第二天我和家人去用早餐，他就馬上來到西餐廳詢問我們的意見等，着實讓我感覺到酒店請到這樣的員工真的賺了！衝著服務，我都不好意思差評了！

msg:這會才想起來評價，當時也忘記拍多點照片了，總體來説是很滿意的，前台小姐姐們，以及管家們和門僮小哥哥們都是笑臉相迎，熱情周到，很温馨！最最滿意的就是酒店所處的位置，在千燈湖周邊，環境特別好，旁邊走路幾分鐘就是商場保利mall，她們自己人管叫保利水城，吃喝玩都挺方便的！開了兩間房，都是望千燈湖景區的，視野特別開闊，酒店雖有些年代了，但房間設施也都很用心的保養，沒有説很陳舊，但其中一間房，味道有點大，就這點不是很滿意，希望下次去住的時候，能改善這個問題。

2、環境：酒店環境很好，距離千燈湖和保利mall都非常近，步行可達。在酒店內的花園散步也很舒服。
3、設施：雖然酒店設施稍顯老舊，但不影響住宿體驗。如果非要按照自己的體驗來給意見，那就是床墊有點軟，不太適合我。另外馬桶是方形的也有點不太舒適。
綜合來説，下次去南海還是會選擇這個酒店，希望越做越好

msg:佛山洲際第二段，千燈湖洲際，周邊環境好，窗外景緻好尤其是晚上，千燈湖的燈火很美，國慶期間晚上真的人挨人。室外泳池比較寬敞，水比較淺，尤其適合小朋友，早晚時段舒服。房內設施稍顯陳舊不太合理，充電插座比較少。吐槽早餐，因為一樓裝修，改到巴西餐吧，地方小導致大排隊。而且樣式因為地方原因，可能衹有正常的一半不到，完全不行。退房不太通暢，一點多就開始辦理入住，導致退房排隊好半天出了一身汗，沒有快速退房指引也挺無語。

還有衞生灰塵一堆，枕頭罩也尤小黑點，被子也有黃色印記，水龍頭大人都很難打開何況孩子，要很用力沒必要吧！所有設施老舊，不知怎麼評上五星級
衞生：差得沒法説
環境：除了窗外可以看見湖其他沒什麼好説的。

入住送了水果跟花生湯、前台很友善，床品很好睡、夜景很美、水壓夠強、浴袍浴巾特別厚特別大件！有全身鏡跟數字讓人心情好的體重計、備品有剃鬚刀🪒。

明明入住率很低，前台小姐姐一直不讓升級房間（我知道不是一定會升級 但是以我住這麼多酒店的經驗，我在攜程的積分+普通日子的週一晚上凌晨2點入住，一般都會有的）

那個100元的禮品卡也沒有。笑死。

msg:我們第一次入住這間酒店，覺得這酒店景觀太好了，而且灑店的服務非常好，考慮太周到了，我們帶了小孫女入住，酒店在我們入住不到幾分鐘就送來小女孩的可愛牙刷和拖鞋，還多送了幾支礦泉水，一袋滿滿的，後又送水果，我們入住這麼多五星級酒店，覺得這間的服務的確讓我們太滿意了，而且性價比也挺高，早餐和晚餐自助餐都非常豐盛，下次我們還會叫上兒子兒媳來度假的，謝謝他們的服務。

第二，房間洗臉池沒有清理乾淨，能看到非常明顯的臟。

1環境：千燈湖公園旁邊，湖景房的話確實環境很漂亮，節日氛圍濃厚，這點是加分項
2衞生：進房間味道挺重的，就是有一股濕氣過後的黴味，整體還算整潔，但是房間一開始空氣不咋地
3服務：服務中規中矩，沒有非常好，也不會不好，就是中午會有人來按門鈴問用不用洗衣，其實這個不考慮打擾顧客嗎？
4設施：這個真的説説了，電話座機壞的，聯繫送東西啥的完全沒辦法，空調那個按鍵也不靈敏
