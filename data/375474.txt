msg:Great welcoming from Jack from the membership lane at the reception for assigning a nice river view room for me! 
Had some struggles for connecting to the WiFi, and they sent a technical support person to come in person to address the issue, a very good caring thing was that they also sent a lady to come along with the technical guy, which shows their caring and consideration for customers! Finally the technician had been very helpful and called their provider to address my issues and fixed the problem!
Though the room was a bit old in their designs and furnitures, their bed was super comfortable which allowed you to have a very nice good rest for the night!
Shout out to Monnie during breakfast time, she was very friendly and considerate enough to serve me for coffee two times, her working attitude is certainly a good role model for other colleagues! I would certainly recommend this hotel if you prefer to stay in a quiet area away from the busy area in Shanghai!

msg:Great hotel. Big spacious room. As others have said, the cooling doesn't work great (pretty much no hotel I've been at in China gets rooms cold during winter, but I could get the temp to 23 degrees).  Big TV, comfortable chair. There is a nice looking sound system, but I couldn't figure it out. Nice big bathtub.

I found the Liquor Town bar my last night. Great pub... Reasonably priced drinks... Except for a can of soda water (48rmb). Not even special soda water. A cozy little place though... Just avoid the soda water.

There are 2 little grassy areas in the hotel compound. Very nice. The indoor swimming pool looked nice, but I didn't go swimming this time. The gym also looked good.

Room service... The food was good... But ordering was a pain. They have a qr code to scan to order.... But it didn't have the full menu and had items that were not on the menu. If you want to order room service. You have to call customer service, tell them you want to order. Then you hang up and room service calls you back... Sometimes you could tell them the food, other times you had to give the foods number.... I hope they come up with a unified way to order.

Not many stores nearby, so if you need something, gotta use eleme or meituan.

Patrick at the front desk was helpful! And unlike a lot of hotel staff members these days at other hotels, he did not ask for me to mention him or anything, which is great.

Very close to the river park. That's the biggest bonus. I walked to the Mercedes Benz Arena along the river front.

Anyway, I had a great stay and will definitely go back. Perfect for a little staycation.

The hotel staff, including the restaurant staff, are very friendly, but the waiting time for check-in is relatively long. It takes about 20 minutes to wait at 4:00 in the afternoon.
The hotel setting is indeed relatively old, and the yellow decoration style is still ancient. The bed in the room is too soft and does not have enough support.
The breakfast is mainly Western-style, which is not suitable for our stomach. The overall cost performance is not high.

Also upgraded to a higher floor with renovated rooms. When communicating with her, she always smiles (different from other front desk staff) and makes her feel comfortable.

msg:Before coming here, I read the reviews, especially the bad reviews, and I felt that there were relatively few bad reviews, so I chose it. After arriving, I didn't think anything in the negative reviews was a problem. I thought the free upgrade to the river view room, the buffet on both mornings, and the overall service were good. The elderly and children are all satisfied. The only thing I found lacking was that my double bed room had two beds pushed together with a gap in the middle.

msg:It was dark and raining and I drove to the hotel and asked the security guard where the parking lot was. I was very impatient. Then I entered the parking lot and the view was unclear. I turned around early and the rear wheel hit the street. I couldn't see clearly. Why on a rainy day and night? Instead of painting a reflective yellow solid line on the street at the corner, the wheel hub was also bumped, which made the 15-year-old driver feel quite ashamed. The hotel room was overall yellowish and dark like the couple's room, but everything else was pretty good 🙂

msg:A great hotel with very good quality. Compared with similar riverside hotels, the price/performance ratio is very high. Its location is very good, right next to Nanpu Bridge, close to the Expo Center, between the Expo Park and Lujiazui, no matter where you go. It's just the right distance for walking or cycling, and doesn't require a lot of physical strength. It only takes a few minutes from the hotel to the riverside, so even the elderly don't have to be too tired to walk. We went to a nearby hotel for dinner on the first night. After the meal, we walked directly along the river from the hotel back to the hotel. After breakfast the next morning, we rode to the Expo Park. We spent a long time strolling along the riverside and in the park, enjoying ourselves very much. The ride back to the hotel was not tiring at all. The upgraded river view room has an unparalleled view. Watching the ships coming and going in the Huangpu River, you can fully feel the charm of Shanghai. The hotel service attitude is good and the breakfast is rich. Another bright spot for young people is that they can walk a few minutes to check in at the popular hot pot restaurant across the road from the hotel. It is said that there are often queues, which saves travel expenses and solves the parking problem, which is also a good value for money.

When I arrived at the hotel front desk, Ms. Carol Zhang handled my order enthusiastically. Because of the platform, she upgraded my room to a very comfortable place with beautiful scenery. During the order processing process, Ms. Zhang even solved my IHG member login problem.

msg:I booked here because I didn’t want to drive across the river to go home after watching Alan Walker with my baby. I just took my baby to stay at Dishui Lake InterContinental two days ago and the experience was great. I thought it would be similar for the same brand, but in actual experience, it was quite different. big. Compared with InterContinental Dishui Lake, which focuses on leisure vacations, this place may be more suitable for business meetings. The service is not as proactive and friendly as InterContinental Dishui Lake. I am surprised that there are very few smiles on the faces of the hotel staff here. The only people I have a good impression of are the chef sister in the yogurt cold area in the breakfast room and the two chefs in the scrambled egg area. They are the only ones who pay attention to the real needs of the children, proactively inquire about care, and provide meticulous service. Thank you very much. They, but also very sorry to forget their names. When we checked in, the lady at the front desk mechanically offered a room upgrade on the condition that she write her own name on the room card case so that I could mention it in my review. However, it was a pity that she forgot to wish us a pleasant stay and did not tell us about the hotel. Basic information about breakfast or parking. When we checked out, we put the room card case and card into the express check-out box. Now when I think about the evaluation, I have indeed forgotten her name.

My room was at the last door. You can indeed see Nanpu outside the window, but there is also a large area of ​​residential houses and construction sites in front of you. This is the river view room.
I was tired the next afternoon and wanted to lie down and rest. Unexpectedly, someone was holding a lawn wedding on the hotel green space below me. The windows were closed, but the sound of music and microphones rang through the sky. Did the hotel not care about the guests in this room? Feel it? Lunch break became my luxury idea at this hotel.
The hotel is already over ten years old, so I won’t go into details about the decoration style, but the cleanliness is not like IHG in my impression. Old dust can be seen everywhere, there is no turndown service, and the mini bar is empty.
IHG is also lonely

msg:When I checked in, the front desk said that I would upgrade to a deluxe river view room, but I booked a deluxe river view room. There is no free upgrade. The front desk staff said that I booked a double bed room. I don’t know if there is anything I can’t tell you. , My name was also registered wrongly, so I couldn’t get on the WIFI in the room. Later, I tried to use the wrong pinyin of the surname to get on the board. The overall room decoration is relatively old. There is no turn-down service at night, and there is no welcome fruit. The next day After breakfast, I was told that there was no breakfast in the room. From the registration information, I saw that my name was not correct. It was so imprecise. After communication, I was asked to eat first. As an InterContinental brand, I got such a service experience for the room fee of 1600 feel
It's really close to Mercedes. If it's not a concert next time, I probably won't live here

The service is very good, but the interior details of the hotel room are still There are many small problems, such as 1. The curtain chain is rusted and caused it to get stuck and broken during the pulling process, 2. The sofa connection seam is broken, 3. There is a wired multi-head charging cable at the head of the bed but there is no end, and there is no USB at the head of the bed The interface, this point can be further improved, and 4. The hotel staff will not take the initiative to say hello to the guests holding the room card in the aisle of the room. 5. The staff in the gym will subconsciously see me holding the room card The first sentence asked me if I was a resident. The overall service awareness needs to be strengthened. I look forward to staying in other Intercontinental hotels next time!

msg:The only thing that is not satisfied with this hotel is the front desk service, and there are no other major problems:
I read the reviews before coming here, and many guests reported that there is a free upgrade service, so I also came to the hotel with such expectations during my stay. But in fact, the front desk didn't mention it, after all, I didn't ask for it. Just thought I might not have given the front desk the impression that I wanted to upgrade. There was no communication during check-in.
But I am really not happy that I didn't take the initiative to mention the rights and interests of free upgrades. There are so many comments in the comment area that were upgraded in June, why didn't they give me an upgrade?
Secondly, I ordered a package that includes a buffet dinner for two. The food for the dinner is not as good as the Intercontinental. Compared with Guangzhou Poly InterContinental, it still feels a lot different. I will not choose to buy a package that includes a buffet dinner next time.

Residents who are not on the executive floor used to watch the excitement and eat with their fingers, but no staff came to stop it.
When I arrived at the restaurant for breakfast, I was told that breakfast was not included. I showed her the Ctrip order, opened my eyes and told nonsense that there would be an extra charge for breakfast, and finally said "Okay, okay, you go in first." I made a complaint call to the hotel, and at first said that breakfast was not included, but changed it in a few seconds. Later, I said that I wanted to communicate with me, but I said no, because it is estimated that the employees are newcomers.
Previously, the confusion of the breakfast on the executive floor was only encountered at Hyatt, and now the InterContinental has also followed. If it goes on like this, is this Intercontinental has been open for too long and is about to delist?

The hotel rooms have been renovated, the TV sofas have been replaced, the curtains and toilets are automatic. However the minibar was emptied and nothing was there for some reason.

The only thing that needs to be changed is that the toilet seat should have damping. If you don’t pay attention at night, you will be shocked. 4. The breakfast is average and the afternoon tea is average. If it is included in the set meal, there is nothing to say. 5. It’s really convenient to stay at the InterContinental to watch the concert.

msg:I used to come here often for afternoon tea, but this is the first time I have stayed here.

This time, a friend was holding an event next to him, so he had the opportunity to discover this treasure hotel.
Now selected as a Shanghai favorite.

Service: First of all, thanks to Dwyane zhang for helping to upgrade the room. In fact, the beauties and handsome men who work here are very nice.

The lobby is spacious and quiet, which may not be friendly to businesses, but it is really a benefit for residents. At night, I often go to the hall with a book to find a corner, and I feel at ease in my own study. Nothing to stroll to chat with the young lady on duty. Feel at home.

The guy who ordered the wine was also kind-hearted. I am used to ordering a glass of red wine before going to bed. I said that their wine selection is good and delicious, so they always give me more 🙃, happy.

I went for a walk on the first day, the sun was very good, and I held my notebook to shade me all the way. The big brother at the door said, there is an umbrella here, don’t forget it next time😄

I won't name them one by one. In short, the service is top-notch.

Environment: The scenery is very good.

I didn't pay attention to it before, just before I left, there was a sandstorm, so I took two photos in a hurry. In fact, it is beautiful when the sky is blue and white.

There are no big shopping malls nearby, presumably that's why it's so quiet. Go downstairs and cross the road to Binjiang.

I often ride a shared bicycle 🚲 to Lujiazui for 15 minutes, shop and eat, and then ride back along the river in a small car. The spring flowers blooming and the breeze along the way are the highlights of every day in Shanghai.
Facilities: There is a spa and the environment is beautiful. The gym is also excellent.

If you want to comment, can you have a QR code to pay for tips?
Most of them don’t bring cash now, if there are tips in the room that can scan the QR code to pay, it will be much less embarrassing.

I called to ask if the air conditioner can send cold air! The hotel said no! Did I say you can't downgrade the master controller or something? The hotel said, should I bring you an electric fan? (I really laughed) So I asked if there were no other guests who responded very hotly? The hotel said that it has not been done in the past three months. I said, let’s see if our air conditioner is broken. I turned it on to the lowest level and it was still very hot. Even wearing shorts and shorts is very hot. You can feel it for yourself. Later, the hotel directly brought me an electric fan and asked me to open the window! The street is so noisy and there are boats singing at night, are you serious? Later, I turned off the air conditioner and the windows were still very hot because they were opened. The next day I responded to this problem again and the hotel still told me to open the windows, and said that other guests also responded very cold. When I checked in on Thursday, the air conditioner control panel showed 27 degrees. Then I turned off the air conditioner and opened the window, and it was still 26 degrees. It was not until Saturday night that it showed 23 degrees. The highest outdoor temperature was 18 degrees. Is this normal? Is the control panel of your air conditioner really useful? Say you have a bad attitude, and bring me an electric fan, and say that you have service, and no staff stay in my room to feel whether it is very hot and help the guests solve the problem.

msg:Usually the front desk will ask me how I feel, and I will tell the front desk. I didn't ask this time, so I will write a comment.

I deliberately chose a hotel with a bathtub, but it turned out to be too clean and useless. The photo may not be very clear.

Different people have different opinions on the quality of paper towels. Anyway, I don't like the texture very much. It feels very bad. Then it’s fine that the paper towel tube on the sink is dilapidated, and it doesn’t fit the paper towels inside. I couldn't take it out, so I had to open the box and pull out the whole pack of tissues for use.

The bedside clock ticked an hour ahead, making me think I was late for a meeting. . .

But the service is not bad. The front desk who answered the phone in the middle of the night helped me set up the wake-up service, and the chef who was responsible for the fried eggs for breakfast was very good.

As soon as I entered the room, I found that there was garbage from the upper guest on the carpet, even popcorn on the floor, and there was a lot of dust on the bedside. The air conditioner was very hot. Poor, the room is quite cold, the background of the bed is old, the lines are broken, and there are sharp corners. My child didn't pay attention at first and didn't puncture it. When I went to bed at night, I found that the light was broken, and the switch was hard to press, so As a result, the bedside lamp was dimly turned on when we were sleeping, and the double bed room we chose was spliced together. The abominable thing is that the fight was so unsuccessful, how could we sleep as a family of three, and the hotel did not report any hope for the most excessive night. , The price of 759 per night is not good. At least it is necessary for an intercontinental hotel to be clean. I didn’t sleep well all night, and the bedding was not clean. I got red rashes on my body in the morning. I paid 1500 when I checked in, and I will refund The speed of the deposit is also incomparable with other hotels. I was told that it will be refunded within 3 days, but what does it mean to refund 740.99 the next day? Isn't it 741? Although it is one point short, but such a refund amount, your hotel is really a godsend!

If you need to change towels, you can call and request. The swimming pool is also closed due to the epidemic. The breakfast is very ordinary, with few varieties, and the variety is incomparable with the National Convention and Exhibition Intercontinental. There are no customers, but the license plate in the garage is mostly locals. I chose this place mainly because it is only half an hour away from Disney by car, and there is a good river view. The location is just between the two bridges of Nanpu and Lupu.
Hope to give it a try again after it's refreshed!

I have almost never commented on the hotel, but this time it really overturned the perception of InterContinental. The carpet in the lobby is really dirty, the toilet paper is only available in the bathroom, and the toiletries are taken at the front desk. After taking the shower, I found that there is no shower cap! There is nothing in the refrigerator, not a single bag in the room, the air conditioner is not turned on enough, there is nothing in the room, there is no light in the elevator aisle, and when the elevator is opened, it looks like the kind of rough without decoration I thought I was on the wrong floor, so I went to the first floor and took another elevator, and found that it was still the same. It turned out that the lights were not turned on, and the floor tiles and walls were gray, which was creepy. The facilities in the lobby are old, and it is really too economical. Unlike other star hotels, which are brightly lit, it should be the reason for the bad business during the epidemic. The breakfast is still very good, but there are almost no waiters, but it is also delicious to eat like this Feel free.

msg:I have stayed at the InterContinental Hotel in many places, and I think this is the one with the worst experience.
Let’s talk about Check in first. When I arrived at the store at one o’clock in the morning at night, the attitude of the staff in charge of check in was lukewarm. This is the first time I encountered this kind of service in the Intercontinental Hotel;
Let's talk about room hardware. The decoration style is like a three-star hotel. If there are different opinions on the decoration style, the maintenance of the facilities is just like the front desk service. Some cabinet doors can't be closed, and I don't dare to use too much force. It's down... In short, it feels a bit in disrepair;
Thirdly, let me talk about the public toilet on the first floor. The smell is a bit strong and it doesn’t feel very clean. At least when I go to the toilet after breakfast at 10 o’clock in the morning, the smell of the toilet is not very comfortable;
Fourth, let’s talk about the underground garage. Park the car at night. The entrance to the luxuriously decorated elevator hall is locked (locked at night). The instructions for the hidden elevator hall are not very clear. After searching for a long time, I saw a person coming from a hidden place. In addition to being frightened, you just know where the entrance of the elevator hall is. Can't you brighten the lights to make a clear sign?
Last but not least, the only good thing is that the breakfast is good, which is a little bit up to the standard of a five-star hotel.
In short, this should be the lowest-end Intercontinental Hotel, and I personally think it is not as good as the Holiday Inn under ihg.

The reason was that there would be celebrities staying in the hotel the next day. Then my friend checked in to the high floor normally.
I argued with the front desk, and Manager Zhang actually said something I had never heard from a service staff member of a five-star hotel: "Why don't we want you to stay? You are here to make us money, so what are we doing?" I'm not happy about it." The whole conversation was very glib and embarrassing to Intercontinental. After calling other managers, Manager Zhang said, "I can write a letter of resignation." I wonder if Manager Zhang has resigned voluntarily now, more than half a month later?
What’s even funnier is that I had something to go out at night, and my friend had to rest in my room because his legs were inconvenient. He ordered takeout and asked if he could help deliver it manually. When the call came, Manager Zhang thought it was me, so he deliberately agreed and waited for a long time. They didn't deliver it for an hour. The temperature was very low at that time and the rice must have been cold. My friend waited for half an hour but no one came and she was so angry that she called to complain. Manager Zhang said in a weird way, "Why are your legs broken if they are not fine?" (Thought it was me), do you want to complain? Didn't you already take a picture of the front desk manager's name tag and say you are going to complain?" To put it harshly, listening to the voice of a big man from the north, what he said did not sound like a man, let alone Like the front desk manager that an InterContinental hotel should have. I have stayed at InterContinental in Beijing, Hangzhou and Chengdu. Compared with the InterContinental at Shanghai Expo, the service attitude is simply embarrassing to other InterContinental staff. As a brand honor, the InterContinental staff work hard to maintain it. .

I sat in front of the window, drinking coffee and tea, watching the large and small ships in the Huangpu River, Nanpu Lupu The two bridges are in front of you, the lights are bright, and you can enjoy it very much. Second, the large bathtub is very comfortable. Third, the breakfast is very user-friendly. I really want to stay for one more night, but I think that I will come again next time, I must keep the freshness, so I hold back the idea of continuing to stay and look forward to returning to this room next time.

When I arrived a little earlier, the waiter handed herbal tea to cool off the heat, but Carol Zhang at the front desk didn't let me wait. Knowing that I have stayed in the past, I have readily upgraded the room type. During the epidemic, many questions were complicated and detailed. She answered very clearly. I have fallen asleep there several times. The view of the room facing east is really good this time. With the help of the prospect of Nanpu Bridge, it presents a different Lujiazui, and the nearby river feels like it stretches to my feet; although there is no dedicated trail , but it is very convenient to go to the Binjiang Trail. This section is rarely disturbed. It is very similar to the Intercontinental in Suzhou, as if there is an exclusive area; if there is a disadvantage, the surrounding facilities are poor. Kind of embarrassing. The facilities are a bit outdated, after all, it has been so many years.

msg:During the epidemic, I did not dare to leave Shanghai, so I chose to bring my family to the Intercontinental World Expo on weekends to rest and relax. I purchased 2 sets of one-berth and two-meal packages on Ctrip. There was only one room left on the website when I made the reservation. I tried to contact Ctrip's customer service for coordination, and they quickly added one for me, thank you. Called the hotel in advance to reserve a Unicom room for me. The hotel tried its best to satisfy me when the room was tight on weekends, and I am very grateful. Evaluate the room first. The furniture and decoration are relatively old, but the scenery of the Huangpu River outside the window is invincible. The tub and shower are large and the water is good. Evaluating the public facilities again, there is no children's playground, only a small area for children to play in the restaurant. But the swimming pool is quite good. There is also a bubble pool for children to play in the water. The water temperature is high and children like it. The changing room is spacious, the floor is dry, and there is a sauna. Finally, I will focus on the food and beverages, which is the most sumptuous buffet I have eaten recently. In recent weekends, I have stayed at the hotel every week, and the Expo Intercontinental is the fourth one, and the variety and taste of its buffet is the best among them. A great weekend getaway, come again if you have the chance.

msg:This is the last time I book this hotel. Is this how regular customers are treated? In the case of a large number of vacant rooms, an abnormal room with a particularly small area at the end of the corridor and a particularly low shelf was arranged, and the room smelled of formaldehyde.
It's the first time I asked for a room change, and I was arranged at the end of the 21st floor at the same latitude, so what's the difference?
The second time I asked to change the room, I was given a noisy room. The central air-conditioning fan downstairs was deafening. It was a failed design to drive ducks to the shelves. It was obvious that the windows were closed, and almost all the south-facing rooms in the hotel were uninhabitable.
The design of the whole building is flawed, the interior design uses bright yellow, the more you look at it, the more unacceptable it becomes, and I will never go there again...very disappointed! Very sad.
Although the view of the river view room is acceptable, it faces north and the lighting is not good. The surrounding houses are quite dilapidated, and there are no dining options.
Advantages The location of the hotel is relatively good, and it is not too far to go anywhere.

msg:I have never written a hotel review so seriously, just because this Intercontinental hotel experience gave me a very ~ very ~ not ~ comfortable ~ comfortable feeling.
First: On the first day of my stay, someone opened the door with a key card and entered my room at around 5 o'clock in the evening. The key point is to use the key card to enter the guest room by myself. After exchanging two sentences of uncommon Mandarin and asking us if we wanted guan shui, we replied no and walked away. I called the manager on duty and learned that this person was a hotel employee to turn the night down. The manager's explanation was that this Intercontinental hotel turned down the turndown for every guest. ah? Is it such an understatement? First of all, it is against the rules to enter the room without the consent of the guests. Secondly, if this turn-down service is a regular service, why not inform it when checking in? This problem is entirely the hotel's own problem. If a single woman is in the room and a male employee opens the door by himself, who would dare to imagine, who can guarantee that there will be no problems. Although I was given a buffet in the end, this behavior caused the residents to feel insecure in the subsequent housing for a long time.
Second: We stayed for three days and two nights in total. On the first day of our stay, we booked afternoon tea at the hotel for camping on the lawn on the second day, and reserved a room number. After noon on the second day, I thought about going to the venue and found that there were people on the grass. What do you want when laying the arch of flowers, no! Have! wrong! Someone got married and the venue is not open for afternoon tea for hotel guests. what! I went to ask the restaurant staff, and the reply was very light: Then you can have afternoon tea in the hotel restaurant. Focus: The lawn camping afternoon tea was changed to the indoor restaurant afternoon tea without notice. I was really amused. The wedding was suddenly today. Thinking of doing it? Why didn't you say when the lawn was used, and double-checked that it was lawn camping when booking, was it just a pie to deceive people?
Third: The hotel room service is extremely slow. During our check-in, we encountered several calls to the room service. One time the hotel desk lamp was broken and could not be used. Double slippers. These phone trips have made me feel the hotel's poor service again. Every time I make a call, I have to listen to the beeping for a long time. I waited for several minutes to get connected. I couldn't believe it was in a five-star hotel, and I couldn't believe it was an old five-star hotel.
Having said so much, I just want to say: Before choosing this hotel, I chose it with my trust in InterContinental and good memories of booking InterContinental in the past, but this trip made me not only disgusted with this hotel. , I also have a skeptical attitude towards InterContinental. I am afraid that this hotel employee is not an undercover agent sent by other hotels. After all, any employee who loves his own hotel will not be so slow to treat his work, and at the same time behave so unprofessional.
I wrote so much just to give a reminder to those who make subsequent reservations, everyone can make up their own minds!

From the welcome desk at the door to the front desk, the temperature measurement at the door, the code reading, and the reception at the front desk, a set of procedures is ordered. People feel more at ease without losing their kindness and sincerity. The anxiety that was originally very anxious suddenly became clear. Because of the epidemic, when I checked in, I was told that the gym and swimming pool were not open. The breakfast was also in the form of a package, which was relatively small. Lost, but it is also understandable in reason... At the moment of this epidemic, it will not cause chaos to the hotel and society, haha. The overall stay is very satisfied, the front desk has good temperament, high appearance, the main service is satisfactory, very professional, if you are on a business trip next time, you will still choose this one, it is worth recommending! ! !

The public space is deserted and unadorned, similar to the elevator room of a mid-to-low-end office building. The front desk staff are rather indifferent. The most important thing is that there is a bluetooth speaker in the room, which will automatically sound uncontrollably. At nearly 23:00 in the evening, the piano music suddenly plays in the room.

Is there no service requirement and management standard in a five-star hotel? However, the hotel did not take it seriously, and told me to change rooms at 11:00 in the middle of the night. This is tossing me, so late, I changed rooms with a bunch of things, and I didn't realize my own problem, and I didn't have any apology. We are here for the festival, you treat guests like this, do you have a sense of service? On the second day, the lobby manager's handling was even more arrogant and arrogant. Could it be that the five-star hotel I spent so much money on did not meet your service. Can you be so arrogant? Why are you selling such an expensive room? The so-called five-star hotel is to deceive consumers. If you can’t achieve the facilities, services and quality of a five-star hotel, please remove the fake brand of your five-star hotel. The facilities are poor, the service is poor, and there is no attitude to solve the problem. I came here to stay, not to be poisoned and to see your faces. Intercontinental is not worthy, everyone should not live in this hotel, the variety is too bad, the service is even worse

msg:Went on a staggered peak on the last day of the holiday. Business is still good. It's good that the parking lot is full, and you have to park on the side of the road at the back door of the hotel.
Check in at the hotel at 2:30 pm. Tell the room to be cleaned and wait for an hour. Ok. Ctrip benefits include drinks. Go to the lobby bar and sit for an hour. I got my room at the last four. Others who applied for a double bed room with me during the same period all got the room first.

health:
The upgraded landscape room looks at the Nanpu Bridge. Now the cleaning of the hotel is to change the sheets! The furniture and bathtub are not cleaned! It's all dust!
The windows are worn and leaking. With the windows closed, there is a lot of wind. This is the rhythm that forces you to pull the curtains and not see the river view!

Serve:
Intercontinental's customized mineral water has been repackaged. very low. Made me think the room was being treated differently!
And there are no drinks in the minibar. Is this a five-star Intercontinental service? Or is it because Ctrip ordered it?

breakfast:
Funny wow. So confusing. Go downstairs for dinner at nine o'clock. The swipe card actually told me that it had already been used. Have an international joke!
They are all baby walkers. The waiters kept clearing the table. I also try my best to replenish food. But good things have to queue up. Really tired. If I had known earlier, I would not have breakfast. mess!

Bad bad bad! Worst stay ever! Bad experience too!

The familiar Nanpu Bridge can be seen lying on the bed. Going out is the South Pier Riverside, which can be walked or biked. The hardware of the hotel is acceptable, in line with the aesthetics of ten years ago. Checking in on New Year's Eve, the rooms were full, and the next day's breakfast was lined up to turn over the table, but we could see that all the staff were professional and well-trained, and they worked in an orderly manner. After the experience, there are only two points, one is the gym, dimly lit facilities are aging, and the other is the executive lounge. Compared with other five-stars, the meals are quite "simple".

The overall facilities and equipment of the hotel are old, and the reunion dinner for 4-6 people on New Year's Eve for 2,699 yuan is at this level. It's really impressive. They are crazy about making money, or they are on the verge of bankruptcy and making black money! After being questioned by customers on the spot that the quality and price of the dishes were seriously inconsistent, the staff jumped on the spot, and the hotel owner (boss) insulted the consumer as a ** in court, and called the police to try to scare off the consumer... I don't know whose platform this series of actions collapsed! A hotel with no professionalism and no professional ethics! Treating consumers with one sentence: "Complaints are your rights", awesome! Do you think that your hotel is so powerful that all government agencies have to serve you free of charge? The most important thing is that the hotel does not have any epidemic prevention measures. No one can enter the hotel at will without taking the temperature, providing a health code, or a travel code. It really collapsed the Shanghai epidemic prevention work. So many epidemic prevention workers are fighting on the front line, and they are all humiliated by this bad hotel! On New Year's Eve, I questioned the hotel's lack of epidemic prevention, thinking that the hotel would be more restrained and do a good job of epidemic prevention on the first day of the new year. As a result, there was no epidemic prevention measure on the first day of the new year! This is awesome! This kind of black shop that ignores society, ignores the requirements of government departments, and ignores consumers, I advise everyone not to stay! ! ! I will resolutely complain to the end!

After repeated comparisons, I chose the InterContinental Expo Hotel, which did not disappoint me. The river view room facing north can see the Lupu Bridge and Yangpu Bridge. Although it cannot be compared with the Bund and Lujiazui, it is also a very good river view. Although the hotel is far from the subway station, it is very close to the South Wharf ferry. I deliberately chose to take the subway to the Nanpu Bridge and then the ferry to stay at the hotel, which is a more interesting experience than driving by myself.

This Intercontinental hotel provides guests with a wide variety of protein, vegetables, fruits, dried fruits and various Staple food. There are freshly baked pork knuckles, freshly baked steamed sea fish and raw fried buns, and there are some meat and steamed buns that are still in the north. It really takes care of Chinese, Western, and North-South dishes. It is a heaven for me who is allergic to eggs. . It can be seen that the operator's intentions and hospitality are very good!

The thing is like this. It’s almost 7 o’clock when I arrive at the hotel. I was told that the cafeteria can reach 9 o’clock at the latest. There are still 2 hours. Logically speaking, there should be a lot of dishes in the cafeteria, but this is not the case. Yes, there are few varieties of dishes, most of the dishes are still cold, the beef is very hard, and the sausages are very salty. None of the dishes are impressive. . . The foreman of the evening said that for birthdays, you can enjoy a buffet with buy one, get one free, but since it is a birthday star, there must be noodles in the buffet. It was only after 7 o'clock, and there was no noodles. The birthday friends themselves love to eat noodles. People, this doesn't even have a face. The first time I only took a little fried noodles, there was noodles in the back, and my friends went to get them again. The foreman said that you weren't full? As the restaurant foreman of a five-star hotel, is it inappropriate to say this? How can people believe that this is a five-star hotel close to the Expo?
The rest of us sent a simple meal, and the simple meal they brought was actually cold, and each one was still different. Is there a choice in itself, such as the simple meal 1234, so that guests can choose one, you When you bring it up like this, it feels like the leftovers from the buffet, this is Intercontinental.
The last person who claimed to be the lobby manager came to apologize with the foreman. The foreman still looked disdainful, saying that he was sorry that he didn't think he had any problems at all. He said "that kind of thing", and he was very confident. , Alas, such a service attitude and such dishes are really far from the reputation of InterContinental.

Although it was later retired, how can it be produced perfunctory) The hotel wins with quality service and hopes to strengthen management. It is commendable that the male waiters at the front desk are very patient and attentive, and their attitude is good. , Thank them.

The first time I immediately agreed, the second time I refused, the third time I refused, and then I followed suit. Ctrip complained and even sent fruit, and promised to help deliver it to the room next time. As a result, the breakfast I ordered was not delivered to my wife until I checked out at noon.

There's no concierge or doorman, and you have to carry your own luggage. The epidemic prevention is non-existent. There are only a few staff members. The room I was assigned was a converted suite with a door in the middle. The soundproofing was very poor. The room service called the extension for five minutes but no one answered. The mobile phone was answered immediately. The air conditioner can't adjust the temperature. It was 28 degrees in the room and I was sweating. It couldn't be turned off. A maintenance person came to take a look and said: "How about I help you open the window?" I was speechless. In the end, I unplugged the air conditioner panel before turning it off. It was really speechless.

Slippers are not allowed in breakfast? (I didn't understand) 2. The operation of the air conditioner was a bit complicated, and I didn't know how to operate it until I left (a bit cold) 3. All the water pipes were not marked with hot and cold directions! (Purely by trial) 4. The lid of the electric toilet has not been lowered slowly, and the sound is very loud when it is automatically buckled (I was scared a few times)

msg:Due to busy work, I took the time to review it today. Staying in your home is the first time. First of all, in a five-star hotel, the new coronavirus epidemic prevention measures are useless. The temperature measurement and visitor registration at the entrance of the lobby is just a decoration. Some people who do not wear masks can enter at will, and no one comes forward to persuade them. Of course, guests may also be accommodated. Not much, so the hotel also neglected management? Secondly, it may be because there are fewer guests. At that time, I stayed on the eve of the heavy snow and solar terms, and the outdoor temperature was already around 10°, but the air conditioning and heating system of the guest room could not play its due heating effect until the evening. Around 21:00, it was still hovering at 22°, and the cold wind was blowing, so I had no choice but to seek help from the front desk. After the hotel engineers came, they used the temperature measuring gun to measure the air outlet, and told 23.5° with disapproval, and then looked at me, what else do you want? I said that your air outlet is 23°, but there is no such temperature in other parts of the room, it feels cold, so it does not heat, is there any way to adjust it? The hotel engineer replied: We don't feel cold. If you're feeling cold, I'll go and turn up the water temperature. This is the service level and hospitality of your five-star hotel? After the guests raised questions, you did not have any apology and comfort, and did not have any measures and plans, and perfunctory things. Relevant personnel also boldly said that we do not feel cold. Afterwards, the room temperature remained at 22.5-23° until the next day. Really disappointed to stay in a five star hotel like yours. If you are trying to save money, you can inform the guests in advance. In the case of a low occupancy rate, your air-conditioning cooling or heating cannot meet the needs of the guests according to the season. Please forgive the guests? Or do you stipulate that when you stay in your hotel rooms in winter, the room temperature of 22-23° is your standard, and you have to decide the temperature of the guests?

msg:是老派5星的酒店風格，環境和設施這個價位也還説得過去。
但是服務態度真的一般，前台衹有一位女士感覺比較禮貌周到，做事幹練。幾位男接待的態度就很敷衍且不耐煩。
希望後面改進吧，給前台女士的服務給5星。

msg:這家酒店真的很棒！從一進門就能感受到他們的專業和熱情。房間乾淨整潔，設施齊全，床鋪舒適，讓我每晚都能有個好夢。而且，酒店的位置也非常好，離世博園區很近，出行非常方便。

然後，我要特別表揚一下他們的員工Lucy。Lucy是我見過的最熱情、最專業的酒店員工之一。她總是面帶微笑，無論我有什麼問題，她都會耐心解答，讓我感到非常温暖。我記得有一次我在餐廳找不到我喜歡的菜品，Lucy立刻幫我詢問廚師，最後還親自幫我點了一道我非常喜歡的菜。這種細心和貼心的服務真的讓我感到非常感動。

上海世博洲際酒店給我留下了非常好的印象，特別是Lucy的服務讓我感到非常滿意。我會強烈推薦這家酒店給我的朋友們，也會期待下次再來上海時再次入住。五星好評！

1、衣櫃和行李架尺寸設計恰到好處，28寸大行李箱都可以平放！我的大行李箱第一次不落地擺放，太方便了！
2、小冰箱和飲料吧枱都放在櫃子裏，很乾凈！
3、衞生間的手機置物架設計得還是斜着的，不論尺寸大小都不會掉下來！很棒！
4、早餐那叫一個豐富！真的是那麼多五星酒店裡最好的了！絕對沒有之一！早餐連冰淇淋和糖果都有！冷盤櫃枱有服務員不停的在添置食物，煙燻三文魚和火腿應有盡有！還有現場製作的鍋貼！絕了～太喜歡了！
不足：
1、房間內的飲料吧裏空空如也，半夜想找點吃的也沒有……衹能叫外賣……
2、游泳池的安全員一直在看手機刷視頻，帶着耳機……向他揮手示意都沒有反應，哎……出點事情估計他都不知道！
3、我們一家4口（兩大兩小）定了2個房間，小寶寶3歲，中午1點睡著了，想和前台打個招呼退一間房，另一間稍晚一會退，結果服務員很不客氣的説“不行，2點必須退房”，結果衹能把還在熟睡的寶寶叫醒，因為沒睡好一下午都在作……難道就不能人性化一些嗎？！

一進門就看到那個地毯真的好惡心，我覺得2-3星的如家地毯都比這乾淨，房間沒有陪一次性，在前台，需要和前台要，我覺得好麻煩啊，這麼大的酒店，這種一次性的東西必須得是最好的，而且多滿足客户要求，房間裏面的地毯也是臟，設施老舊，什麼亞朵比這個便宜一半，乾淨比這裏乾淨一倍，除了江景值得一看，別的真的沒啥留戀的，服務還是不錯的。

msg:環境：位置是真的不錯，定的江景房，窗外的景色還是非常可圈可點的。離陸家嘴和外灘都不遠，不管是旅遊還是出差都算是很好的位置了。但是不挨着地鐵站，出行還是打車方便些
設施：比我想象的老舊很多，很多設施是不好用的甚至是壞的。電視真的是夠古老，很小而且不是智能電視，入住幾天都沒打開過，這一點和亞朵這些都差了好多。茶几、皮椅子都有破損。牆紙鼓包+卷邊。窗户關不嚴，能看出後期又打了孔裝了兩個開關，處理的真的是好粗糙。
衞生：打掃的並不乾淨。牀頭櫃後面都是厚厚的灰，平時是看不到的，關燈的時候瞟了一眼簡直不忍直視…走的時候還發現櫃子上有一些類似紅色糖漿的液體…
服務：服務平平吧。沒有哪位工作人員露出過笑臉或者是親切一些。打車到店和離店都有很多行李，門口的迎賓站在那完全沒有反應…
早餐：還可以吧，品類算是豐富，但沒有蛋糕，果汁飲品也基本都是勾兑的，除了一個西瓜汁。這可是人均兩百多的早餐…
總之覺得比較失望。訂單裏有一份贈飲可在一樓咖啡廳兑換，晚上想去坐坐沒有人，好不容易來了人和我説贈飲不是酒水單上的。要了杯果汁，這位工作人員去自助餐區域接了一杯給我送過來了，嚐了一口是滙源。要我説還不如不送這個贈飲，有點膈應人了

停車庫的門口始終放一個墩子，這不就是不讓人進去的意思嗎？所以當我把車停在酒店大堂門口，詢問哪裡停車，門口的服務員非常的不耐煩，畢竟他忙着在刷手機。後來我才發現，把車開過去，等車庫服務員來拿走這個墩子，這是何必呢？
我訂了四間房，詢問酒店能否給其中一個房間放一張小方桌或者小圓桌，以便於我們可以開個小討論會，酒店的答覆非常的乾脆，沒有！這是一個很過分的要求嗎？如果不過分，做不到就委婉地説聲不好意思，實際上我得到一個冷冰冰的答覆，讓我覺得我提這樣的要求真是刁蠻。
有一説一，早餐特別好，品種豐富，味道也大多不錯。

酒店出來，就是南門涮肉，南陸線的碼頭，吃好後散散步坐坐輪渡。
泳池不錯，分大池和熱的泡池，熱池幾本被小孩佔領，更衣室有桑拿房，但沒有泳衣甩幹機。健身房器械齊全視野開闊。
如果帶孩子來，這個酒店沒有小童樂園哦。
總體體驗不錯

缺點：1、開車到酒店大堂門口，問門口禮賓車停哪裡，愛答不理，問了幾遍説沒車位了，要我們繞出去停別的地方；2、房間設施有點舊，房間小，是地毯；3、準備洗澡時發現浴室裏沒有放洗浴用品，找了半天沒找着，打電話問説在凹槽裏，請看圖，這還能凹到哪去？就是忘了放了。客服説會送來，一共等了半小時，中間又打了兩個電話才送來，還好娃就直接用洗手肥皂洗了，不然要等睡著了。

防疫要求泳池、健身房都關閉了，餐廳也沒有都開，但是早餐設計的套餐可以自由選擇也還算豐富。

重點表揚一下餐廳的服務員，因為攜帶的注射葯物需要冷藏保存，酒店的小冰櫃温度不夠，和服務員協調幫忙放在餐廳的後廚冰箱裏。服務員包裝細緻並寫上：“客人葯品，請勿動”，取走的時候服務員Jacky zhang很貼心，把葯放在裝好冰塊的盒子裏並用保鮮膜包好，這樣回家路程就放心啦！小小的舉動，在這焦躁的抗疫日子裏很温暖！

msg:隨着更多更新不同噱頭的酒店層出不窮，尤其所謂的網紅酒店 更是又多又密，老百姓的喜好也許也一直在變，但唯獨家門口的這家洲際，卻是我們一直過週末放鬆的首選，從江景房/服務/早餐的豐盛度到健身房游泳池的設施，每一樣都讓我們很滿意，對得起老牌五星的頭銜，週末出來和老公或者家人小住放鬆 真的是非好的選擇，還有一點追隨他的理由，就是酒店的絕大部分服務人員 素質都比較高，有有求都能基本滿足，一點沒有因為年限比較長，就有怠慢，很滿意。週末小休 我們會一直一如既往選擇他們。還有一點要吐糟下 隔他們不遠的 禧玥酒店，什麼***鬼江景房，什麼***榮新記的早餐，真是小網紅的宣傳噱頭，頂多一個升級版的亞朵商務酒店，可價格卻直逼5星，除了工作人員服務OK，其他沒有一點可以圈點的地方，懂的自然懂。

但凡去世博幹活也會是首選。衹是這次很不滿意

msg:最近上班太累了，就想着週末挑家酒店好好休息休息，放鬆下，這家的地理位置其實有點尷尬，説它不好麼毗鄰黃浦江岸，晚上夜景很美，説它好麼，離世博園和陸家嘴都有點距離，附近沒地鐵沒公交，出行除了共享單車，基本靠自駕。
普通房是面對花園的，從豪華房開始就能看江景了，房間裝潢略微有點老氣，而且鏡子特別多，特別是浴缸直接被鏡子環繞了，插座分佈不太合理，衹有床的左側能充電，筆記本電源這種比較大的還插不進穩，一直會掉。
枕頭有張清單可以更換成自己喜歡的，床也很舒服，直接讓我睡到第二天退房了哈哈。頂層的行政酒廊暫時不開放，想要享受行政待遇的話衹能去一樓了，聽説酒店有個紅磚酒吧，在花園外，不過也因為疫情關了，有點遺憾。
