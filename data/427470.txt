Had a room on the 47 floor. View from the bathtub is really nice. Breakfast on the 50 floor is having breakfast with a view. Priceless.
Enjoyed the hot pool and steam sauna (free of charge)

Only thing I hope they can change is that the mini bar fridge isn’t cold at all and it’s just normal room temperature but not a big deal for me. Recommend this hotel for it’s price and service.

From the moment we arrived, the service at the front desk was impeccable, making us feel welcomed and valued. The hotel's prime location allowed us easy access to explore the vibrant city of Foshan while also enjoying the tranquility of the surroundings. The rooms were impressively quiet, ensuring a restful stay, and the in-service food exceeded our expectations in both quality and variety. The highlight of our stay was undoubtedly the luxurious sauna, hot sauna, and steam facilities, which provided the ultimate relaxation experience. Additionally, the outdoor pool and well-equipped gym added to the allure of this remarkable establishment. Overall, our time at the Swissotel in Foshan was unforgettable, offering us the perfect retreat for relaxation and enjoyment. We cannot recommend it highly enough.

msg:Certainly worth it if you are staying for a night or two.

The service was lovely and the location was great.
Multilingual staff on hand, very polite.
Parking available and taxi/didi drop offs at the front entrance.

The room was great at first glance but after a brief inspection needed some work.

Positives:
The view
Room size
Bathroom with separate bath and shower
International WiFi 
International tv
Minibar with reasonable prices 

Negatives:
Bed was rock hard
AC wasn’t working
Room was in need of a few minor repairs
Not cleaned well

To top this off it was Chinese new year so lots of staff will have left as we found out during our trip to the top floor bar where there was only one waiter handling the restaurant and bar, we decided to leave him to looking after the restaurant customers but he was very polite and apologised though he needn’t for the situation.

The staff are superb but the rooms need a little investment.

We are very happy with the accommodation as all was clean and tidy. Room was big enough and had a good view at 42th floor. 

I did not like Bar51 as that was nowhere near swissotel quality, its like a cheap bar on a street. 

Totally recommended for staying 1-2 days

The part of the breakfast experience that I will never forget is the view of downtown Foshan that you can enjoy while you eat your breakfast. The breakfast room is on the 50th floor and the view is stunning. The location is perfect for us since we love to walk around the city. Although the bed is too firm, the room is nice with a beautiful view while you enjoying your bath time. Will surely come back to Swissotel for another experience in Foshan someday.

It is worth mentioning that there are many varieties of breakfast desserts here, all of which are delicious. There is also Shunde's shenggun porridge, which tastes very authentic and super awesome!
The hotel has a swimming pool, dry and wet steaming, which should be quite comfortable in midsummer.

He introduced the hotel's facilities in a gentle voice and helped us upgrade our room. By the way, the perfume in the lobby is not very strong, which I personally like~ (The tiramisu in the cafe on the first floor is delicious!)
I really like the room type this time. The bathtub is by the window, which is very nice~~ The bed is not particularly soft, and it is very comfortable to sleep on. There is a chaise longue next to it. It would be better if there was a small footrest. alright. The bedside table also has wireless charging, which is very convenient ~
When checking out, it happened that Jack was also at the front desk. Haha, we chatted for a while. I felt that the overall service a**osphere at the front desk in Switzerland was very good. The training was very good. I will stay here again next time.

I have to say that Accor's brands still attach great importance to service.
From the room, you can see the skyline of Foshan City. There is still traffic on the road until early in the morning.
The only thing I'm a little dissatisfied about is that the soundproofing of the room is not good. You can clearly hear the hair dryer next door using it at night.

There is a buffet restaurant on the 50th floor, and breakfast is also here. However, the restaurant area is a bit small, but fortunately the variety is abundant. But one thing is that the elevator is a bit loud. Our room is not that close to the elevator shaft, so we can hear the low-frequency noise going up and down.

The advantage is that it is located in the center of the old city and is very convenient to go to the ancestral temple. There are many shared bicycles and electric scooters in Foshan, which is very convenient. We were traveling with our three-year-old son, and Foshan Paradise was highly recommended. Our son played there all afternoon and stayed there. Ctrip also states that if you stay for two consecutive nights, you will receive breakfast. In fact, there is no such thing. I asked the front desk and they said that it is only available in special room types. The deluxe double bed room I stayed in did not have it (I guess if you stayed in other room types, he would also say this so-and-so) No room type). Fortunately, I complained to Ctrip and refunded me the equivalent of breakfast. ps: There should be more foreigners staying in the hotel than Chinese. It may also be a hotel designated by foreigners during the Canton Fair.

msg:It was very good. My family gave me small gifts and cakes for their birthday. The room was clean and hygienic, the view was great, and swimming and wet and dry steaming were both good.
In the evening, we watched the night view and the show at Bar 51. The buffet in the morning was very good and the waiter was nice. Overall, it was a good value for money!

msg:I found this hotel by accident. It is a good destination for traveling in Guangdong during the National Day. The price is also very reasonable and has not gone too high. The service is very good, enthusiastic and proactive, and makes you feel at home. The breakfast is a bit weak, which is not suitable for Foshan, the world's gourmet capital, but the raw porridge is good. The surrounding transportation is convenient, and you can walk to the subway station, shopping malls, and core attractions. Just be careful in the tunnel that you must pass at the door. The outdoor swimming pool is a plus.

The deluxe room we got this time has a wide view and you can enjoy the night view at night. The hotel buffet is on the 51st floor. It has a good environment and rich dishes. You can also enjoy the scenery of Foshan, which is great. The restaurant bar on the first floor of the hotel also sells delicious salads for only 24 yuan a serving. All in all, the stay was a good experience

I originally wanted to send my luggage and go out for lunch before coming back to check in. However, the front desk quickly completed the procedures and told me that I would be able to pick up the room card later. The service was great.
The breakfast was very rich. It was on the 50th floor of the building with a great view. I had a great time. If I come to Foshan again in the future, I will book with this hotel✌✌✌

msg:Maybe there were a lot of guests staying in the hotel during the National Day. When I checked in, I had to wait for a while because the room was not fully ready. The drinks next to the front desk are delicious. Coming in from outside on a hot day, having a drink is very thirst-quenching. The hotel rooms are all located on high floors, and you need to change to the elevator on the 36th floor, but there is not much inconvenience. The rooms on the upper floors have great natural views and are very quiet. The room is clean and tidy, and the various facilities do not feel old. For example, all kinds of switches are induction and touch-sensitive, which are easy to understand and operate. The hotel is not far from the subway station. It is convenient to take the subway to Shunde or Guangzhou. There are many places to eat and shop around, and you can basically just walk there. For example, there is a Minxin store near the hotel for tourists to check in, so there is basically no need to wait in long lines. I have never stayed in other high-end hotels in Foshan, so I can't compare the facilities and services, but comparing the prices, it is still worth choosing to stay here.

msg:I happened to book this hotel while attending the Foshan Guochao Music Festival. In an old five-star hotel with a slight sense of age, I was assigned a suite on the top floor for the first night. The design was extremely unreasonable. The air-conditioning outlet was facing the heads of the two beds, and there was no way to lower the air volume. I didn't dare to turn on the air-conditioning all night. It's extremely cold but not extremely hot. I changed rooms the next day and this problem no longer existed. The breakfast is on the top floor, which is pretty good. It has all the basic items, and the porridge is really good. Parking is free.

I also captured a photo of the plane taking off from Foshan Airport ✈💪. The restaurant is on the 50th floor. The breakfast has a variety of varieties and fresh ingredients. There are local special porridge, noodles and rice, as well as various European buns, salads, fruits... The hotel is far from the Ancestral Temple It is very close to Lingnan Tiandi, only a 10-minute walk away, very convenient. All in all a good stay experience

The open-air circular swimming pool is on the seventh floor, with a wide view, and you can watch many foreign programs on the TV. Secondly, the service is lacking a lot. At night, the child was thirsty and asked for two bottles of water. After waiting for a long time, it was delivered after a second phone call. Before going to bed, I found that the quilt cover was damaged. In order to avoid unnecessary trouble, I asked the room service to change it. , I was told that during the old and new exchange period, it will not affect the use, and it can be changed or not. Is it so difficult to change a bed sheet?

There is Zumiao Station on the Guangfo Line nearby, and the bus 🚌 station is also close! The Ancestral Temple attractions can be reached on foot, and you can also visit Lingnan Tiandi at night, all of which can be reached on foot.
The room is booked as a family room, which belongs to a suite. There are two rooms, one big bed and two small beds. It is very friendly to families with many children, and the room is very clean! I live on the 44th floor with a wide view. The breakfast is on the 50th floor overlooking the beautiful scenery of Foshan. It's really great!

msg:Because I had a good impression of Foshan before, I brought my friends to visit Foshan again during the Chinese New Year. Unfortunately, the couple caught B-flu and had a high fever. When they arrived at the hotel, there was no one to greet them. There was only one male waiter at the front desk to receive guests who were checking out. The guests wanted to postpone their stay. If you check out at 14:00, the hotel will not agree and you must hand over the room at 12:00. And I contacted many times - the room that was supposed to be available at 14:00 was told that the room would be available after 16:00. After informing the hotel of our condition, we were still unable to hand over the room. I dragged my body around the hotel and felt dizzy. I sat in the hotel lobby. At 15:45, we started to negotiate loudly with the hotel. The waiter asked if the cleaned room could be released. The guest was a little anxious, so the hotel manager on the other end of the intercom released a cleaned room.
——🌿, where are you playing? Is this how an established hotel treats its guests?

You have to transfer to the guest room elevator on the 36th floor. The room facilities are good, but there is a room type that is very narrow and long, and feels oppressive. The room types of 01-04 are better. There are many working doors in the aisle, which feels a bit scary. I dare not live alone. The breakfast is on the 50th floor, the design is also poor, and there is almost no view. Seats are old and uncomfortable.

The environmental facilities are very hygienic and clean. Every employee who just stepped into the hotel is very polite and thoughtful, with a smile on his face, amiable and ready to answer any questions, which is very praiseworthy. 👍👍
It's true, at first we didn't have any expectations, we were just looking for a comfortable and quiet hotel to stay in for 3 days and 2 nights, check in was very efficient, and it was done in a few minutes. 👍
After entering the room, I found that the room was very tidy. The most important thing is that there is no mold in the bathroom, and the condescending beauty of Foshan is in sight. 👍
The swimming pool on the 7th floor is absolutely top-notch. I played on the left 2 days. There are spas, dry and wet steaming, jacuzzi, etc. on the same floor...don't miss it!
Located in the Chinese restaurant of 5 Lu, the standard is high, boiled chicken is a must eat👍
There is a Swiss coffee shop on the 50th floor. We ate buffet breakfast for two days, from 6:30 to 10:30. There are many kinds of choices, we must try.
On the 51st floor, there is an Italian restaurant that specializes in steak. The sky garden has a beautiful environment. Unfortunately, there was no seat on the day I went up, so I didn't go there. I will try it next time.

All in all, I would give this hotel full marks. The overall environmental sanitation is quite high, and the staff are friendly and talk like family members. I have traveled all the way to Foshan, and I think the people in Foshan are very kind and warm.
I will definitely come again next time, with ten LIKEs! 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍

The breakfast buffet is very good, especially the variety of western food. The cakes and bread are delicious, and the coffee☕️ is also good. Whether it is the front desk receptionist or the waiter, the working attitude is very good. I originally booked a room on Ctrip for one day, but ended up staying for another three days. It is very convenient to take the subway from the hotel to Shunde in Guangzhou. The last thing worthy of praise is that I left the necklace in the room. After checking out, I found out when I arrived in Guangzhou. I called the hotel with an attitude of trying. I had no hope at first, but the hotel called back soon. Yes, tell me I found it. I was very excited. Praise for the hotel's timely handling of problems and the spirit of the waiters who are willing to collect money!

Health: Not bad, quite clean
Environment: Not good. What can be seen from the window is the platform wall of the hotel building, which looks dilapidated. The elevator makes a loud noise. It was slightly better after changing rooms. This problem may exist in all rooms. As soon as you leave the hotel, you need to go through the underground passage. This underground passage is the weirdest passage I have ever seen. The turntable passage is dirty and long. Motorcycles are racing around and people and cars are mixed together, so that even if we are only 500 meters away, we have to take a taxi. , it’s too difficult to leave! Of course this is not the fault of the hotel, but it does affect the access of hotel guests.
Service: Good service is the biggest highlight of this hotel! The front desk can try its best to meet the guests' requirements without pushing or procrastinating; the waiters at the hotel door take the initiative to help pick up the luggage and deliver it to the room.
Breakfast: The breakfast is rich in variety and tastes good.

It is said that some swimming pools were originally used by teachers to teach swimming, and all of them are for children to play. They can't go into the water at all. There are too few varieties of buffet, and there are only 2 to 3 hot pots, which are average.

After this point, I don’t want to stay in a hotel managed by this hotel group. And as a high-end member of Ctrip, I can enjoy it for many years I have paid online in advance to enjoy the rights of staying first and paying later. This hotel still charges a deposit that doubles the room rate, and there is no fast track for check-out. You must wait for the room inspection before issuing an invoice for the deposit refund. It has long been a credit It’s time. Well, this kind of approach will only lead to fewer and fewer customers. I suggest that the group quickly change the general manager, otherwise you will really play yourself to death. I strongly don’t recommend it. It’s too far away from the five-star standard. The breakfast is not good, and the elevator noise in this hotel is very loud, people who like quiet should be cautious

For example, the air conditioner in the room we lived in at the beginning was only for heating because of a single pipe, so it was unbearably hot even in thin pajamas without a quilt. We had no choice but to call the front desk, and the manager quickly took a new room card to the door for us to change. The rooms are really nice. It is indeed much cooler after changing the room, but it is estimated that the smoking room is changed, the smell is very strong, it is better to keep the air conditioner on and spray perfume while going out, and when it is time to take a bath at night, there is no bathtub The hot water is only very warm water. I put half a tank of water in it, and the water is completely cold before people go in. The shower side is better and can be washed. The first time I came here was in 2019. At that time, there was no hot water when I came back after the new year, and I finished washing with trembling. At that time, I thought there were too many people using water at the same time, so I endured it. Unexpectedly, this kind of problem will still appear after a few years, and it is the case that the flow of people has been reduced due to the influence of masks. In the early morning of the next day, there was still no hot water in the bathtub. I asked the room staff to check, and only tested the water temperature. Oh~ I left without any solution. However, the environment, sanitation, front desk + lobby manager's services, I think, still meet the standards of a five-star hotel. The overall feeling is ok, but the hotel really needs to pay attention to the facilities.

msg:As a hotel person who has worked in the first and second tier positions of four- and five-star brand hotels at home and abroad for nearly ten years, I am more concerned about everything about the hotel. Based on what I have seen and heard, I give this hotel a score of 3.

Facilities: relatively old, and the sound insulation of the room is poor. I don't know whether it is the neighbors or the upstairs and downstairs residents who always make noises after ten o'clock in the morning during the stay.

Hygiene: False eyelashes left by some previous resident were found in the shower room, and there was a hair about 6cm stuck on the dental kit packaging.

Environment: Located in the center of Chancheng City, it is more convenient to eat and play, but the layout of the parking lot is quite special, and it has a sense of sight for the second test.

Service: From the moment I entered the hotel lobby, no one greeted the guests until I stepped into the reception (I was about 3 meters away from the front desk at the time) and a man took the initiative to wave to me. Guide guests to check in, but it may be hindered by the fact that the hotel has a monthly quota for recruiting members for the front desk staff. The entire check-in process revolves around being invited to join the membership, and does not introduce hotel-related facilities to guests, and guide the hotel Elevator, room location.

As a hotel person's opinion on the hotel side:
1. Regarding parking, you need to register the license plate number in the lobby or call to register the license plate every time you leave the car. Guests can go to and from the parking lot multiple times without repeating the registration of the license plate number, saving everyone's time, why not do it? ? (PS. The ventilation system in the parking lot needs to be strengthened, and the smell is relatively strong. As a parent, I will definitely not take my children to the parking lot of your hotel to get in the car!! I would rather wait outside the parking lot for the car to drive out before getting in the car)

2. As for the toiletries in the room, I personally think that only one set is not enough. Even if the shower room and bathtub in the room are integrated, you should not neglect to add toiletries on the side of the bathtub.

3. Regarding the room, the anti-slip mats and blinds in the bathroom have mildew spots to varying degrees, and even if the sliding door of the bathroom is closed, it will still seep out, and it is easy to slip with the blessing of the floor towel.

The location of this hotel is great. It is in the city center but the floor is high enough so it is quiet. There is no smell in the room and the air conditioning is very fast in cooling and heating.
The hygiene is great, the bedding has been changed in time and there are no stains in the past few stays.
I will choose this hotel next time I go to Foshan~

Although it belongs to an old hotel, the facilities and equipment are still OK, and it will not be said for a long time. The room has been upgraded, and the bathroom can also see the view from the window. The scenery outside the window is first-class and the field of vision is wide. The variety of breakfast is okay, it would be better if it could be a little richer. The most impressive thing is the service. It has the level of a five-star hotel. It is polite and responsible. When I checked out, I found that the clothes I left behind immediately called and delivered to me. These small details are great, and I hope they can continue. There is a chance to come again.

It was obviously rinsed with water, and then the boiled water was poured out. There is no problem. There are two spare blankets on the wardrobe. , an oily musty smell, the blanket has been 80% fluffed. For these feedbacks, there was no response from the manager, but only asked if I needed to replace the blankets, so the service has two points because the lady at the front desk warmly helped me upgrade the room, knowing that I said happy birthday to me on my birthday and gave me a small Gift. The staff also did not take the initiative to say hello, and will not choose here in the future.

msg:The facilities are old and poor, specifically
1. The sound insulation is very poor, the sound from the next room and especially the corridor can be heard clearly.
2. One room in the suite has no ventilation window, which makes it hot and stuffy. The window in the other room is not big and can only be opened a little. Moreover, the central air conditioner is not working, only blowing air but not cold air. Although it is winter, the sunny weather in Guangdong in winter is equivalent to the weather in May and June in central China. The room was stuffy, not ventilated, and couldn't cool the air conditioner. At night, I felt like I was in jail and couldn't sleep.
A stable and comfortable rest should be the most basic desire of all travelers. If you cannot even meet this requirement, I will not be ashamed of the nearly 1,000 yuan a night room rate I paid, but also the five-star positioning of your hotel.
In addition to the issue of deposits, there are really not many hotels that still require deposits. If you insist on charging them, the hotel should give the customer a payment voucher after paying the deposit. Otherwise, if there is a misunderstanding when checking out, I don’t know how to explain it. This is so unprofessional.

When I step on the quilt, there will be a sound of tearing cloth *****s. Hehe, everything else is okay. The service is good. The reception and room service are good. I will send the children's slippers and toiletries soon When we arrived at the room, the children took a bath in the bathtub. The breakfast was on the 50th floor. The variety was okay and could meet popular consumption. It was a pity that we didn't see it as a lion dance due to continuous rain for several days! In addition, Foshan is indeed a bit strange. It is a bit strange that the child’s information needs to be registered separately when the child checks in. This situation basically does not exist in other parts of the country. The child’s information security will also be leaked. This is incomprehensible, because the Public Security Bureau requires registration to be done online. After handling it, why bother to copy it out by hand alone, it is completely incomprehensible!

🧹Sanitation: Sanitation is OK. It was originally arranged at 4014, but it was too close to the elevator entrance. Change to 4018. This location is better and quiet, but the light on the desk is broken. Auntie was still doing cleaning at the time. Ask if Need to be repaired, thinking that there is no need to repair it. There is trash under the washbasin in the bathroom, which can only be seen by sitting on the toilet.
🍃Environment: A veteran hotel that has been in business for more than ten years, and overall it is quite good.
🔔Service: The executive room type was booked at that time. When checking in, it was arranged on the 40th floor non-smoking floor. The staff indicated that there were activities. If the executive room type was booked, the afternoon tea in the executive lounge was free to upgrade to the buffet dinner. However, the executive lounge was originally used by members, and there were a lot of guests eating buffet that night, and the executive lounge was also arranged to be noisy. The swimming pool is outdoor and the water is not constant temperature. It takes courage to swim in this weather. There are spas in the locker room, and only one of the 4 spa locations is available. These hardware facilities really need maintenance.
I have to say that the staff service is warm and thoughtful.

It is very calm and generally produced. The breakfast is also on the 50th floor, with a first-class view.

There was no reception at the entrance of the lobby, and there was a temperature measurement standing at the door without a pit and no temperature measurement. The room hasn't been well hygienic. I need to wait more than an hour. The front desk recommended me to eat in the restaurant on the 50th floor. He first charged me a deposit of 500 yuan, and the room card was not given to me. It was the first time that he encountered a deposit for the first time in so many star-rated hotels. When I arrived at the restaurant, the receptionist did not say hello. I asked him if it was an Italian restaurant. He asked me "What Italian restaurant?" I said, is there still food in it? He said that it was almost two o'clock that there was nothing to eat. Without any expression, being cold and indifferent was like owing him five million. Then I found a Chinese restaurant on the fifth floor by myself, and received me after two closes, and the service attitude was also very good. I went to get my room card at half past two. The front desk said that you would check in by yourself and give you a breakfast first, but I booked a room with two breakfasts. He gave me one breakfast and the other refunded? I didn't say that as a courtesy. The corridor of the room has a smell, the carpet is very dark, the layout of the room and suite is oblique, the sleeping window blocks the outside wall pillars from the outside scenery, and there are cockroaches 🪳, the bar on the 51st floor is very small , A smell of air is not circulating. The service staff brought some fruits, which were not fresh. The yellow decorations on the lobby wall are covered with dust. Not worth recommending to everyone. Negative Ratings

msg:No stranger to Foshan, Swissotel Heng'an is also one of the favorite hotels in the Zumiao business district.

Yingbin: No surprises, no surprises, no one is standing guard outside.

Lobby: During the epidemic prevention and control period, some staff asked to scan the code and disinfect their hands. Check-in was simple and fast, meeting my requirements for smoking rooms and late check-out.

Room: This time I booked an executive double room, arranged on the 39th floor. The room size is more than 45 square meters. Whether it is the bedroom or the bathroom, the lighting is very good, and you can enjoy the endless scenery outside the window while soaking in the bathtub. The room is equipped with three capsules of coffee, which is undoubtedly a plus for coffee lovers. The air conditioner is super powerful, obviously much more than the experience of the last stay. Sanitation is also in place, no major problems have been found, and minor problems can be ignored.

Executive Lounge: Located on the 50th floor, the view needless to say, great. The layout of the dining table is relatively spacious and has a certain degree of privacy. Hot dishes, salads and drinks are not bad.

Restaurant: It is on the same floor as the executive lounge and offers a buffet-style breakfast. Although there are not many choices, it has met my expectations.

Surroundings: It is within walking distance to the ancestral temple and Lingnan Tiandi. There is a 7-11 convenience store and Ruixin Coffee downstairs.

Minus items:
1) The inside of the coffee machine is not cleaned. There are pictures and evidence.
2) The magnifying glass in the bathroom has been loosened and the angle cannot be adjusted.
3) There are too few choices of dishes in the executive lounge, and there is no choice of juice.

bonus:
1) The hygiene is obviously better than my first stay.
2) Regardless of the front desk, restaurant attendants and cleaners in the hotel will take the initiative to greet them.

In conclusion, I will definitely choose to stay in Hengan Switzerland again.

酒店員工每個都很友善，讓人感覺回家了一樣，這點很好，晚上去酒店樓上的酒吧喝了一杯，有駐場，還有小龍蝦，很實惠的小龍蝦，比排擋還便宜

酒店設施都很新，下次來還要住

還是比較老的酒店了，乾濕蒸，lounge bar都配很足。就是3個點令人有點抓狂。睡前找不到好的插座充電，最後拔了床頭鐘的一個插座來給手機充電。然而睡到半夜想看幾點，發現沒有沖進去電，迷迷糊糊中突然清醒，到處找原因，原來是關燈關總開關的話，插座也會停電，就這樣旁邊那位在亮燈儀式下也醒了。充上電，就研究哪裡關燈。好不容易躺下，隔壁3點多還在説話不知道是不是沒關電視，週日晚上，完全不滿房的情況下，為什麼不把客户安排分開一點不要互相打擾呢？重新困難入睡….. 
設施：
1. 床頭兩邊沒有給手機的插座
2. 晚上關燈按總開關的話，插座也會停電
3. 隔音不好

缺點：畢竟是老酒店了，第一天安排的46樓晚上總有不斷的異響，工程師傅看了説正下方是一個水房，換到42樓，42樓還沒翻新相對較舊。這幾天佛山最低温度降到個位數，但中央空調開的還是冷風，反應後送上來一個油汀，這點服務還是不錯的。另一個問題就是隨着氣温下降水温也不夠了，熱水開到最大也沒有一點點燙的感覺，衹是温熱，洗澡很容易感冒，希望能早日改進。

The duty manager came over with a confused look and a very rude attitude. It meant that you couldn't live with him anymore. He brought his wife and children in the middle of the night and he really didn't want to argue with you. The hardware facilities of a well-established hotel It's not working in the first place and the service isn't there yet, so just withdraw the license.

msg:This hotel is one of the worst among five-star hotels. First of all, the lobby is poor, the service staff is pitifully small, the doorman is safe and secure, and only two people at the front desk do the registration. Secondly, the elevator has to be transferred. Halfway through the ride, you need to transfer to the next elevator. Then the room has a strange smell, and the bedding and toiletries are not as good as four-star.
Let’s talk about the hotel’s service. I originally booked a room for four days on a business trip, but the result was a temporary change. After staying for one day, I needed to check out. The hotel insisted on not refunding the three-day refund. Fee, Ctrip took a lot of effort to communicate. During this period, I suggested to Ctrip that the room rate for the first two days of the hotel can be charged at the original price of the hotel. No discounts are required. Just return the next two days. It doesn't matter if you get less money back.
I will definitely not stay here in the future, it is safer to choose a five-star brand.
