msg:I found breakfast quite limited but cheap of courae. The room was nice. No furniture on the balcony. No beach nearby but not far from Dadonghai by car. Nobody speaks English at the reception. Every communication took a long time. 
Our fridge did not work and we were told it is the same in every room. We insisted to change it and they did. The swimming pool is large but mostly shallow and nobody swims in it. But we tried and found one hood spot a bit deeper. I think they need to change the carpet in the hall and improve breakfast.

The hotel boasts a wide range of facilities suitable for families, making it an ideal choice for those traveling with loved ones. The pool area was pristine and inviting, providing a perfect spot for relaxation and fun. Additionally, the beautifully maintained golf course offered a delightful recreational option.

One of the highlights of this hotel is its superb location in the Luhuitau area. Not only is it in close proximity to the stunning seaside, but it also offers easy access to the city center, making it convenient for shopping and enjoying the vibrant nightlife.

Overall, I highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Sanya. With its exceptional service, family-friendly amenities, and excellent location, it truly provides a remarkable experience. I look forward to returning on my next visit to 

Sanya."

msg:Clean hotel. Location is good, only 4 minutes by taxi to Xiaodonghai, and 10 minutes to Dadonghai. Breakfast is good, there are some western options. Swimming pool is big, but only the area in the middle is for adults, other sides are for kids. Not enough sun beds near the swimming pool. 
There is no direct entrance to golf fields. If you want to play- need to go to the golf club next to the hotel. Room is very cozy, with balcony, super comfortable beds and pillows. 
Reception doesn’t speak English. But when we asked to help us with the TV in our room the staff was very helpful. Thanks for that 👍

The hotel is located in Luhuitou, which is convenient for going to the scenic spot. I consulted in advance for this stay. Sister Xiao Wei at the front desk arranged the room in advance and added WeChat to say that there is service at any time for consultation, which makes people feel very reassured. Now in May and June, Sanya is relatively less touristy, and the room has been upgraded. The children play on the beach during the day and soak in the bathtub at night. The experience is very good

I was lucky enough to meet the beautiful lady Li Ting, the manager of the Chinese restaurant. She gave a detailed introduction and added me on WeChat. Because I came back late for dinner the next day, she prepared the meal for me in advance and did not recommend too much. Eat enough and eat well.

msg:The weather in Sanya should be the best in the country, right? I don’t accept refutations and criticisms. Fortunately, I didn’t follow the trend. I definitely went to an internet celebrity hotel. After looking at the ratings on Ctrip.com, Mingshen is quite satisfactory, with moderate prices and enthusiastic service. Most of the staff are locals. They have a simple personality and are easy to talk to. Manager Katherine I have arranged a good room and will consider coming again next year!

In contrast, Mingshen Golf made me feel that the service will be more humane, the facilities are also very new, and the rooms Very clean. Mangroves have poor sound insulation! There is also a sailing base next to Mingshen, and the scenic area is also very close all the way back. Although it is not in the city center, it is right next to the sea. After eating, I always want to go for a stroll nearby. The key is that there are not so many people and it is not so noisy. . I will choose here again next time I come to Sanya! ! !

1. Our garden view rooms are super large and cool, with an executive suite-like layout: the super large double balconies can not only see the hotel's scenery but also the distant mountain scenery. Young children can run and play in the living room. The 2-meter wide bed in the bedroom is super comfortable and clean. Children can jump and roll on the bed without falling off😄
2. A golf-themed hotel also enjoys additional benefits: you can choose afternoon tea or activities at a professional golf driving range: We have never been exposed to golf, so of course we chose the golf experience: go to a professional golf driving range. Although we didn’t pay, after half an hour of practice, and accompanied by the swings of professional golf enthusiasts next to us, our family of three fully experienced the joy of teeing off golf😄
3. The most worthy thing about the hotel is actually its service. We have a lot of luggage, so we received attentive service of carrying luggage during check-in and check-out. The check-in time is 2 o'clock in the morning, and we can also get water and paper delivery services, and cleaning. 🧹The room is proactive and clean, which makes me a germaphobe. The breakfast is very rich: when we arrived at the restaurant with a baby, it was close to the 10 o'clock breakfast deadline, and the staff would remind us to pick up what we need as soon as possible. Food 🍜 and didn’t bother us to continue our meal
4. The hotel's internal facilities are also very complete: gym, slides and swings, as well as a large outdoor swimming pool that is loved by young babies, allowing us to cool down in the swimming pool at night until ten o'clock late at night😄
Closer to home, this is a super warm and comfortable hotel that we look forward to staying at again. We and our children both had a very good stay experience👍

However, the overall stay was very good. The hotel swimming pool is also great. It is a very quiet hotel and is very close to the sailing port.

Then the hotel room decoration is old and the public facilities are also bad. The check-in experience is not as good as the one I stayed in Guoguang in 21 years.

The balcony of the room has a wide view, the palm trees swaying in the wind, the golf course in the distance, and the large swimming pool downstairs. The beautiful scenery everywhere is so pleasing to the eye. The hotel is also quite unique. You can catch the sea around, there is the Luhuitou Scenic Area, there is a pier opposite, and there are also a lot of water sports. The hotel is also a complex, and it is very convenient to eat. There are Chaobai Vinegar Hot Pot, Coconut Chicken, etc. A hotel suitable for vacation.

msg:In the fourth hotel in Sanya, I took my family and I booked it for two days, but everyone was so satisfied that I didn't want to leave, so I stayed for another two days. First of all, the location of the hotel is on Luhuitou Mountain. It is very convenient to go to Luhuitou scenic spot, Xiaodonghai to catch the sea and sailing port. Secondly, the room is very large, and the balcony is very convenient for drying clothes. In addition, the manager Rao Wei at the front desk is very good in service. He guided us to choose a more suitable room type, and provided considerate service in every detail. The cleaning staff, Yang Chengkun, worked quickly, cleaned up, always responded with a smile, and helped me find the clothes blown off the balcony at night with a flashlight. It is worth mentioning that the swimming pool is large and the water quality is very good. It is cleaner than other hotels I have stayed in. The lifeguards are very responsible and always remind children to be safe. All in all, the experience was very good and I will come back next time

They changed the room immediately and provided door-to-door service throughout the whole process. They helped me to collect the box and take the box to the new room, and didn't let me apply for it...

I didn't come to clean the room after calling the next day. I have stayed in the fast international five-star hotel, and there are more than a dozen large and small hotels in Sanya. This is the first time I have experienced such a service, and the peak season hotels have also followed suit? Will not stay again, bad review!

msg:🍃Environment: The hotel is near the Luhuitou Banshan Peninsula. The hotel is relatively close to the Dadonghai end, but it also needs to drive, and it is too far to walk. Opposite the hotel, across the road is a large lawn and a beach. The beach is full of rocks, and bare feet will hurt. It is still possible to pick up small hermit crabs and conch shells. There are some marine activities, but not many and not very formal. Diagonally opposite the hotel is the sailing pier, where many sailing yachts are docked, and there are several restaurants on that side.
But not much, not abundant, not much choice. Next to the hotel are some European-style buildings (churches or something), which are said to be wedding photography bases. I saw a few couples shooting there, but tourists are not allowed to visit and take pictures.
🧹Hygiene: The hotel is generally hygienic. The hardware facilities are indeed more age-like and not humane enough.
🚗 Transportation: We arrived on the fourth day of the first day and stayed for three days and two nights. The overall feeling is that the traffic is not so convenient. Without a car, it is difficult to even go to a meal, find a decent mall or store, and the online car-hailing is unwilling to take orders (it is too close). Cancelled. The seafood sold in the seafood restaurant near the hotel is expensive, three times the market price. In short, as a seaside city, we are not going to be slaughtered.
Better place: the hotel is very quiet, suitable for rest. The breakfast in the hotel is quite rich. There are porridge, noodles, pastries, pastries, fruits, coffee, and drinks. The hotel supplements are still very timely.

There is a 3/2***1 bus four minutes away. It costs two yuan to go directly to Sanya Hospital for nucleic acid testing, and there are various flash sales at the municipal party committee's duty-free shop (some things are much cheaper than the Haitang Bay duty-free shop).
The hotel's front desk service is particularly good, gentle, thoughtful, polite, and understands your needs. The recommended itinerary is worth the money. It's also good to experience golf. Opposite the hotel (200 meters) is Xiaodonghai, where you can see the whole of Sanya. Take three or four stops to Luhuitou Park, where you can see the view from a high place.

The hotel didn't care about Internet celebrities, and suffered in the era of **. It's a pity that the rating can't go up. This hotel is definitely a treasure.

I have to complain that some Ctrip "members" make various unreasonable demands and threaten to give bad reviews... I was really speechless when I saw this family in the hotel. This hotel deserves five stars. If you think 1-3 points, why waste your membership privileges? It feels like commercial blackmail. The hotel satisfied this family one by one, but they were still not satisfied and wanted a big suite... Oh

The swimming pool and bathtub are amazing~ Wash away the fatigue of the day~ The garden landscape is amazing, suitable for lying down! Away from the hustle and bustle.

Take the bus to the city center, there is always a seat~ Very fast

There are several new bars, western restaurants, and cafes in the city center, with Southeast Asian style. I feel that Sanya tourism has been upgraded.
Anyway, this hotel is worth it, and the price is too conscience. The brother and sister at the front desk are very good

I will come again next time I come to Sanya.
I still have more than 20,000 points to spend at the duty-free shop. I will come next year.
Sanya is a bit cold in January, so you need to wear a sweater and trousers. I thought Sanya was hot all year round. Sure enough, many girls and tourists on the street wear ultra-shorts, hahaha, it turns out that I am not the only one who made a mistake.

🧹Hygiene: I don't know if the room was upgraded in a hurry, and the tabletops on the floor of the room are not very clean, but they are all within the acceptable range.
🍃Environment: The hotel is very big and the rooms are big, but they are old and depressed and not well maintained.
🔔Service: The front desk service is good, but the travel photos sent by this company are really very perfunctory and very poor.

The hotel staff recommended several casually: the opposite is the sea, you can play with your bare feet on the soft sand, and there is a yacht marina next to it. You can play marine projects, there is an internet celebrity photo-taking place nearby, and there is a 4A-level tourist attraction not far away. The places to play are quite concentrated, not bad.

msg:The front desk feels very general, and the reservation depar**ent hangs up before finishing the call. The service of the restaurant is quite good, but the breakfast taste is average and not very rich. It is not worthwhile to add more than 100 double breakfasts on the basis of the room rate. The room I stayed in at the beginning had a big, stuffy, damp smell. I felt like vomiting. After staying for one night, I made various phone calls and finally changed rooms. I know, there are not many people living there, there must be rooms, but I just don't want to change it. Anyway, I won't live there again. The ventilation of the changed room is much better, but the room facilities are really old, and it feels that it has not been maintained very much. The hygiene is OK. There is a swimming pool and an independent garden, which is not bad.

msg:酒店偏僻，但是難得安靜，停車方便，整體還是不錯。前台給升級海景房，可惜海景房不但視野不太好，外面馬路噪音大，樓頂的空調主機還特別特別吵，像是坐老式的火車，完全沒法睡覺。從晚上十點半開始一直找前台協調，到十二點才把主機關掉一些，雖然還有噪音，也衹好堅持一下。但是，酒店半夜又偷偷打開主機，吵了一晚，好不容易熬到天亮，六點過去找前台要求換房，前台工作人員就冷冰冰説了一句：沒有房間，他沒有辦法。直到七點過，前台才又聯繫給換回了安靜的園景房。將明知有問題的房間拿出來賣，遇到問題還不積極解決，服務實在太差！

總體説來，硬件還算過得去，但服務態度真是不敢恭維。所有的服務人員（我接觸到的）全都是一副冷冰冰的面孔，沒有任何感情可言…來這邊的朋友都是度假的，遇到這樣的服務態度心情難免受到影響。最奇葩的一件事，我們正常六個人入住（套房），衹給了四瓶水，跟服務員多要兩瓶，得到的回答幾乎是完全一致的：每個房間衹免費提供四瓶，再要水需要付款。相信大家都住過旅店，不論檔次高低，如果跟服務員多要兩瓶水幾乎全部都會提供，何況我們是正常入住六個人。衝著這樣的服務質量，今後絕不會再來了！另外，周邊交通不便，想入住的朋友慎重。
