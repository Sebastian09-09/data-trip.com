When we asked him about a museum.  He used his own break time to get all information we need.  We highly recommend this RitzCarlton.  The executive lounge is also great，food and view.  Services were excellent.

I fully expected the facilities to be stylish, and comfortable, which they were, but what made the stay extraordinary was the staff.  Any member of the R-C team I encountered went out of their way to be pleasant and make me and my friends feel welcome.  From the reception staff, to the staff in restaurant Lavendula, everyone was so friendly and helpful.  I look forward to a return visit and know that I will encounter the same wonderful staff.
The location is perfect, the views incredible, the food delicious, and the people, perfect.  Thank you.

The best view:
A bird's eye view of Xuanwu Lake Jiming Temple, the daytime and night views are the best in Nanjing;

The best location:
Nanjing's most prosperous Deji Plaza is just downstairs from the hotel, the owner is Deji Group, and the hotel's proprietress is Fan Bingbing;

The best service
The staff quality and service details are the best in Nanjing, the dishes are first-class, the design of the two Chinese restaurants is invincible, and the executive floor has champagne and Spanish 5J ham to drink and eat!

The art collection is the best in China, and the hotel's art display is all works by big names!

Because it was my birthday, I specifically asked the hotel for some requirements. I didn't expect that the hotel basically met my requirements. I was really happy and had a romantic and unforgettable birthday.

msg:About my being kicked out of Nanjing Ritz-Carlton
I checked into Nanjing Ritz-Carlton on my birthday. I called ahead to ask if I could upgrade. After being told that I could not, I changed the reservation to a lake view king bed. When I checked in, I was given a corner room without my consent. They said the view was better. The manager sent me to the room and introduced some facilities. It felt good. After seeing the dust on the teapot and urine stains on the sofa, I went to the lobby for afternoon tea (very sweet and unpalatable).
Hygiene: When I went back to the room in the afternoon to boil water for tea, I found a hair in the kettle. I waited a long time for a new kettle. The sofa stains were reported as unresolvable.
After that, we went out to eat. When we got back to the hotel, we found that the Ritz-Carlton turndown service was to put water on the bedside and collect the trash. There was no turndown gift, bookmark, bathrobe or ice cubes. Maybe my room rate didn’t include these.
Facilities: After that, I was going to take a shower. It was funny. I couldn’t find the hot and cold water signs. I searched for half an hour. When I turned on the faucet, I found that the hot and cold water were installed in reverse. I was doused with cold water. After finally finding the hot water, I found that the water was flooding. One of the drains was blocked.
Service: I decided not to tolerate it anymore and asked the manager. The manager came in and asked if it was convenient. I said it was convenient and took the maintenance worker to the bathroom without asking if there was anyone (this is the service of Ritz).
Investigation found that a few hairs blocked the drain. How many hairs can block the drain for us men? I reported a series of problems after checking in, and asked to change to the original room type the next day, and find a lake view bed without large frosted glass.
Regarding the false advertising, the pictures uploaded by Marriott's official website and Ctrip are all normal glass. When I checked into the room, I found that one-third of the glass was frosted glass, and there was no explanation. Don't be fooled.
Regarding food safety issues, the watermelon for breakfast was rotten, the coffee capsules had no production date, and there was no need to eat breakfast in the hotel. The Xiangpai sparkling water, which cost one dollar a bottle, was served. There were few varieties, and I didn't go to Yaduo for breakfast when I was selling duck blood powder!
The next day, the room service director communicated with the situation and reported it in turn. What shocked me was that he actually said that the sofa was clean and the stains could not be washed off. He thought that if the stains could not be washed off, it was clean. This was the first time I heard this view. Then he apologized and told me that he couldn't change the room. There was no room I booked (shocked again). He told me that the reverse installation of hot and cold water was the first discovery in the four years since the opening (still shocked). Then the solution was to send a car to take me to a new hotel or destination (directly drive me away). This is the ceiling in China. I am ready to sue. I hope everyone will lower their expectations and don't step on thunder! The problems are summarized as follows: 1. Food safety, rotten fruit at breakfast, and no production date or expiration date for coffee capsules. 2. No room available when arriving at the hotel, promised to change to the original room, but then no room available, and changed the room type without prior communication. 3. Hygiene issues, urine stains on the sofa, serious scale in the bathroom, moldy sink, hair in many places, liquid stains on the window. 4. Engineering issues, abnormal noise from the air conditioner, reverse installation of hot and cold water in the shower, and clogged drainage in the bathroom. 5. False advertising, the actual frosted glass in many places does not match the promotional pictures. 6. There is no unified operating standard, and the night bed service is not standardized. 7. The down pillow has no support, which leads to stiff neck and bruises. 8. The guest promised to change the room but could not do it, and there were many rooms for sale on the same day. There was no solution, no solution or people to solve the problem.
This Ritz is a huge makeshift team! It is a world of difference from the Xiamen W where I live.

msg:Very good stay experience! I have stayed in many Ritz hotels, and Nanjing Ritz may be one of the best. The decoration of Ritz is still classical and luxurious. The hotel feels quite new and good. The receptionist on the 38th floor was very enthusiastic and arranged the room very efficiently. The view from the 47th floor can overlook Nanjing City, which is very spectacular, and the Yangtze River in the distance is clearly visible. Below the hotel is Deji Plaza, which has many big brands and is very convenient for shopping. Walking along Changjiang Road, you can reach the entrance of the Presidential Palace in less than 20 minutes, and it only takes about 10 minutes to take a taxi to Confucius Temple. By the way, the pasta in the lobby bar is good and worth recommending! The breakfast style is very complete, but I really can't eat too much, so I only picked a few, which is still good! Overall, it is highly recommended! ~

The amenities are Diptyque Fig, and the toilet is TOTO Washlet.
However, as a top luxury new hotel in Nanjing in 2020, the shower and hair dryer are badly rated, at least they should be Hansgrohe and Dyson, right? The mini bar is also fully charged? !
Finally, I strongly recommend Pining Mansion on the 39th floor, every dish is delicious!

It can be delivered within 3 kilometers of the surrounding area, and there are many delicious foods around. Deji is downstairs. When you don't want to go out, shopping in the mall is also considered a city walk.

msg:I took my mother to experience the best hotel in Nanjing on Mother's Day. The biggest feeling is that the service here is very good and considerate. Before checking in, we asked about our needs in detail. When we heard that we were elderly, the housekeeper Bettu immediately arranged a room near the elevator for us. Later, she specially sent flowers for Mother's Day, which made the elderly very happy😊.
What made me happiest was that the front desk saw that I was with two elderly people, gave us an extra buffet breakfast, and took the initiative to delay check-out to two o'clock. Very satisfied. The package I bought included two tickets to the Art Museum on the eighth floor of Deji. I even saw the original works of world-famous painters such as Monet and Picasso, which made me really enjoy an art feast. It was great.

msg:Hygiene: When I checked in on the first day, I saw a hair on the quilt after making the bed, so I just removed it myself. I was not happy to find a waiter. There is a lot of dust on the exhaust above the toilet, which should be cleaned frequently.
Service: I have already said when I checked in that I was checking in alone, and I also registered one person's ID card, but I made two beds every time. This is actually a bad experience. Other things are still OK. The room was cleaned the next day and it was done quickly. Things bought in the mall will be confirmed and sent to the front desk for help.
Facilities: The electric curtains can never be opened and closed with one button. It may also be that I don't know how to do it. The plug of the hair dryer is easy to loosen, and I have to press the plug many times every time I blow my hair.

msg:I decided to go to Nanjing for 5 days on short notice. I searched online and found that everyone recommended Ritz-Carlton. Then I decided to book 2 nights first.
Needless to say, the location of the hotel is in Xinjiekou, which is convenient for going anywhere.
Most of the hotel settings are OK, but there are a few points that need to be pointed out.
First: Due to the glass curtain wall design of the building, there will be a piece of glass in the room that is blurred every other piece, which seriously affects the view of the room. Different rooms are different. If it doesn't work, you can only change rooms to see if it is better.
Second: Living in a lake view room on the 45th floor, the air conditioning pipe makes abnormal noises, which affects sleep. I found the staff in the middle of the night and arranged to move to the next room. Because the rooms are adjacent, the pipes make the same abnormal noises. Then the pipes separated the rooms several rooms away, and found that this room was louder. This time it was not the sound of the pipes, but the sound of the air conditioner vibrating and driving the air outlet shutters to vibrate together. I couldn't accept it immediately. The duty manager finally had to move me to a room two floors higher, and this time the room was finally normal. I couldn't sleep until 3 o'clock in the middle of the night. The experience was extremely bad. I was too tired and didn't say anything to the duty manager.
Third: When I was visiting the scenic spot the next day, a staff member called to inquire about the situation, which is positive for the guests. The staff apologized for the situation the night before and said that they would not arrange a problematic room for me next time. I think this is normal, right? Later, they said they would give me a gift as an apology, so I thought that the matter would be forgotten. When I got home, I saw that it was a little lion doll, the same little lion as the gift included in the room fee when I checked in. I think it would be better not to give it.

Overall, it is not as good as what is said on the Internet. There were problems in several rooms on one floor, but they were not checked in advance. I think this is an oversight in work. The so-called apology to the guests afterwards was just a simple response. Although I didn't think I could compensate for anything, it would not be so perfunctory as sending the same doll. Well, that's the end.
Special thanks to the electrician on duty that night, he was really patient and serious.

msg:Transiting from Nanjing, I learned from the Internet that the Ritz-Carlton in Nanjing is the best in China, so I took my children to stay there. First of all, there is no problem with the room, the facilities and the view are very good, the bed is very comfortable, and it is more suitable for me. What I want to complain about is 1: The fragrance of the Ritz-Carlton in Nanjing is too sweet and greasy. It is no longer fragrant, but has reached the level of greasy. The child said, "Mom, I feel dizzy!" 😂2: The check-in time can be called the end of the world. I have never experienced a hotel with such a slow check-in. In addition, during the waiting process, I found that several guests checked in frequently. I felt that there was something wrong with the hotel system. The guests were helpless, but the check-out was fast. 3: Waiting for the check-in time to go to the bathroom in the lobby, my God, the sanitation condition surprised me. One toilet flushed and the toilet was full of toilet paper. There was urine under the base of a toilet, and I couldn't even put my feet. The washbasin was full of water and the towels were messy. There was one aspect that guests didn't pay attention to when using it, but the hotel didn't clean it regularly. A young lady who came in after me also said it was dirty. 4: The night bed service is equivalent to nothing. I went back to the hotel at more than five o'clock and didn't go out. The hotel said it was open, and I didn't see anything special. When I checked in at other hotels, the night bed service should not be too obvious. I knew it was open as soon as I entered the door. Although it is not important, a good night bed service can really make people feel happier. 5: You have to wait in line for breakfast, but this is no problem. After all, you have entered, there is no seat, and it also affects the environment. The hotel's Western pastries are good, give it a thumbs up. The child ate the chocolate in the room and informed the staff when checking out, but there was no charge. I don't know what happened. The invoice cannot be issued by the hotel, but it must be issued on Ctrip. I was directly issued to me in Changzhou Wenpu, but this is not important. Guests who need paper just need to pay attention. At present, I will still stay at the Ritz-Carlton when I go to Nanjing in the future. After all, isn't it convenient to visit Deji? 😄 I hope that the hotel can continue to improve its services in all aspects in the future.

There are also heavy water stains on the shower glass. The paint is also obviously worn out. The room fee of more than 2,000 is probably just right. More than 4,000 during the May Day holiday is a bit cost-effective.

Parking is convenient. There is a dedicated hotel area underground, which is convenient for entry and exit. The staff at the door provide very accurate guidance...
We changed to the elevator to the lobby on the 38th floor. Check-in was very fast. GRO contacted us one day in advance to reserve a complimentary afternoon tea and arranged room preferences...
There are not many sockets in the room. There are too many electrical appliances now. You may consider adding some more. At that time, the socket next to the bedside table in the room was not powered. It took more than 30 minutes to repair it... You should always check it. Other room facilities are very convenient, but the hair dryer is not very easy to use and is too heavy...
The breakfast is great, the service is good, the varieties are many and exquisite, and the taste is very good. There are not many hotels that can make the breakfast beautiful and delicious. I must give it a thumbs up...
The gym is also good. The staff are very enthusiastic and introduced the use of all the facilities in the locker room. The gym equipment is very advanced and easy to use. The built-in system can be said to be very easy to use and smooth, and it is highly compatible with ! When I got up early, there was no one around, so the experience was very good... The temperature of the steam room was good, and buckets were prepared in advance...
The complimentary afternoon tea... is not very appetizing. I feel that no afternoon tea snack can be as good-looking and delicious... The environment is good, the sun is out in the afternoon, the staff introduced it in detail, and also asked about dietary restrictions...
The location is good. You can go shopping just downstairs. It's not far from Confucius Temple and Xuanwu Lake...
Worth coming again!

The service attitude was not good, which made me very unhappy! In addition, all the drinks and food in the mini bar were charged, and there were no free snacks.

msg:A very happy stay! As expected of the Jinling Lion King recommended by major platforms and friends, the executive experience is very good, the food and drinks are of high quality, not ambiguous, and the service is warm and thoughtful. Every detail of the room is in place, and the postcards and Nanjing lions given are also very cute. I would like to thank Betty from the Customer Recognition Depar**ent for her timely communication and preparation before, during and after the stay, and I would also like to thank Vera, the deputy manager of the Executive Lounge, for her thoughtful service during the use of the lounge. In short, Nanjing Lizi can be a good choice whether it is for travel or other activities.

msg:I have heard of the fame of Nanjing Ritz for a long time. This is my first time staying here and I was really amazed. The hotel is located in the core area of ​​Xuanwu District, which is convenient to everywhere. The room has an excellent view. If you stay in a suite, you can see multiple city views and overlook Xuanwu Lake. Because it is a newly opened Ritz, the hotel facilities are very new, and the decoration style fully demonstrates the top luxury of Ritz. The room design is very tasteful, with modern luxury style combined with the ancient capital's literary and artistic a**osphere, showing the cultural heritage of Jinling. From the moment I entered the hotel door, I deeply felt the excellent service quality of Ritz. The enthusiastic and proactive concierge brother who offered help, the professional and thoughtful front desk, the enthusiastic lady of the fitness center, and the comprehensive guest rooms and catering services all make people feel at home. It is especially worth mentioning that the executive lounge is really worth the evaluation of the ceiling of the executive lounge of mainland hotels. The luxurious five meals a day, rich night drinks, and the high-value and professional and meticulous service team really allow VIPs who enjoy executive courtesy to get the supreme service experience.

There are stains on the ceiling, the wallpaper is also bulging, and the floor seams are not cleaned thoroughly. Compared with the same hotel in Chengdu (the latter opened earlier), it is indeed a bit worse. The 50 square meters of the room should be the building area. In addition, the executive breakfast cannot be used on the 38th floor.

In addition, there are too few types of lunch and breakfast, which is unexpected!

I didn't know to bring a set of afternoon tea when booking the room. The hotel reservation depar**ent called to confirm the itinerary and the afternoon tea time the day before arrival. The service was very good! The room was clean and hygienic, the bedding was comfortable, and the facilities were complete. Shampoo, conditioner and shower gel are refillable. I asked the room service that I didn't want to use the shared package, and new supplies were delivered immediately. The concierge service was in place, and it was very proactive to open the car door and take the luggage. 👍The afternoon tea was a set meal, very rich, the snacks were delicious, and the portion was large. Two people couldn't finish it. The only shortcoming was the breakfast. There were really few varieties. I stayed for three nights, and the breakfast for three days didn't change. In the end, I didn't know what to eat after walking around. This is something I haven't encountered in hotels above five stars, and it's incomparable to the Ritz-Carlton in Sanya.

In the guest room, every detail reveals luxury and comfort, and the bed is so soft that people don't want to get up after lying down. The hotel's restaurant is also a highlight, with a rich variety of food and first-class taste. Moreover, the hotel's geographical location is also very advantageous, with convenient travel and many luxury goods around. In general, the Ritz-Carlton, Nanjing not only meets all my expectations for accommodation, but also brings surprises beyond imagination. Next time I travel, I will choose here again, it is definitely worth recommending!

Hygiene: There are no dead corners and it is quite clean.

Environment: There is a subway and a shopping mall downstairs, and the transportation is convenient.

Service: From 10 meters away from the main entrance of the hotel, a female service staff came to ask if you check in and helped to send luggage.
When I arrived at the front desk, someone took the initiative to coordinate the check-in at the front desk because there were many people that day.
The front desk asked enthusiastically if there were any special requirements and introduced the relevant restaurant facilities in detail.
After checking in, the service staff personally sent me to the room to introduce the room facilities.
I had breakfast in the restaurant. Because the breakfast restaurant was full and there was no room, I asked if I could eat in the lobby bar. The service staff asked the room number and led the location very professionally. Asked if the location was satisfactory.
I met the room service staff in the elevator. Before getting off the elevator, I bowed and said sorry to bother you.
I was really surprised how the hotel's service training was done. Everyone is so professional. Everyone is not doing mechanical service for work, but making you feel enthusiastic from the heart. The hotel is really perfect.
Even children say that the hotel service in Nanjing is much better than that in Shanghai.

There was no waiter to actively guide me, and the tableware that should be added was not added, so I had to get it by myself. There were not many choices for the buffet dinner, and there was not even a bartender for the evening liqueur. In short, the meals in the executive lounge were mainly buffets. The above is fine, but they actually called to inquire after leaving the hotel, and the words were implicitly saying that a pillow was missing and asked if I had taken it... It can be said that I was speechless to a certain extent.

Except for the waffles, the afternoon tea was okay. The other desserts were quite disappointing, and the style was not innovative. The main theme of dinner and breakfast is that there are few people and quiet, and the taste is not good. The view is not as good as the restaurant downstairs. There was no one in the lounge at night, so I just wanted to have a drink and relax.

I saw that I had an upgraded theme room with my two children, and I didn’t need to wait for a long time. The children had a room at the hotel after the game at noon, so they could have a good rest. They also introduced the package in detail, including the tour guide and I have to praise Julie for the dining service. The water in the room and the desserts for the children were very timely! Thank you very much. Our travel concept is still based on comfort, so the hotel is a plus point. However, the service in Nanjing scenic spots is really hard to describe. In short, if we want a good parent-child experience, we still can’t choose holidays! So it’s happiest to stay in a hotel and just go shopping and eat!

It is recommended to come to the swimming pool in the morning and swim after getting up. There is no one there, and there are more children at night.

msg:The room facilities are complete, and there is no need to elaborate on basic aspects such as hygiene. This is what a hotel of this level should be like. The supporting facilities in all aspects are acceptable. The free tea provided is slightly inconsistent with the hotel's positioning, but it is acceptable. The breakfast quality is good, but the variety is slightly insufficient. Both Chinese and Western styles are actually lacking, which makes it difficult to choose in terms of direction.

The characteristic of Nanjing Ritz-Carlton is that it likes to use hidden compar**ent design very much. Whether in the breakfast room or in the room, hidden compar**ents are used to hide refrigerators or minibars to increase the overall visual simplicity of the environment, but the decoration style is actually gorgeous and complicated, which leads to a more contradictory look and feel between the equipment design and the actual hardware, which is slightly abrupt.

The service is generally unsatisfactory, and more polishing is needed in the details. For example, the night bed service can actually be notified by phone or at check-in without knocking on the door. Whether it is a double bed or a twin bed room, one pair of slippers is provided for each room. In fact, if it is a twin bed room, two pairs of large slippers can be provided.

The antique cabinet/bookshelf in the room adds a very good a**osphere to the living environment, but it may be due to the power design problem. The coffee machine is also on the bookshelf. For equipment with liquid splashing and water vapor, it is obviously not appropriate to place it here, because it increases the risk of items such as books on the bookshelf, and may also be detrimental to the equipment on the office desk island below it. The coffee cup configured in the room is slightly larger than the coffee machine and is easy to overturn. When I was operating it, I found that the radius of the bottom bracket was slightly smaller, which is possible. The coffee machine is in the suspended cabinet, which undoubtedly adds to the risk.

There are many other details, such as no pillow/quilt menu, I don’t know if it is optional. As a room sold with door panels as partitions, the sound insulation can be said to be almost 0. The normal voice and TV sound in the next room can be heard very clearly. There is no temporary sound insulation trea**ent at all. The minibar is full of charged drinks, and it occupies too much refrigerator space, resulting in less available space. There are many unsatisfactory places, so it is not particularly suitable for families with children to stay in my level of room. The design of all aspects is not even convenient and reasonable for adult men.

Finally, why did I write such a review after a few days? It was mainly because I sorted out relevant opinions and suggestions with my friends before leaving, and wrote a handwritten opinion sheet on the desk, but five days have passed, and the hotel, including the so-called check-in housekeeper, has not made any response. I think it is very likely that the opinion sheet was directly discarded after I left the hotel. This is extremely rare in my experience of staying in high-level hotels, and even in all hotels with opinion sheets. This is enough to explain some problems.

I can only say that all aspects need to be polished. As the newest Ritz-Carlton, it needs to improve in all aspects except the hardware facilities.

I give a big thumbs up. There are also some small regrets. One is that Nanjing is foggy and rainy, which is a pity for the good view on the 60th floor. The other is that I personally feel a little mechanical. I don’t want to eat in the executive lounge in the morning, and I want to go to the lobby (because the elderly have a cold and want to drink porridge and water, so there are more choices), but the front desk told me that I need to pay the difference, but it’s the same Li Zi, and there is no such situation in Sanya hahahaha... Overall, it’s still pretty good. Next time I come to Nanjing, I will still choose his house

🌈This is my first time staying at the Ritz-Carlton, Nanjing. I must say it is a very pleasant experience❗️Amway told my colleagues that this hotel is the highest-rated Ritz-Carlton in China. It is indeed a worthwhile trip.
-
🌈Environment: A**osphere and luxury | Full sense of high-end; the brass-textured hotel door and the concierge wearing a purple cloak have a sense of solemn luxury like the mansion of a wealthy family in the Republic of China; every art decoration is just right, perfectly integrating the ancient charm of Jinling and the Ritz. Some nobility.

🔴The service can be said to be super warm and considerate‼ ️
✨Two days before check-in, I received a call from Branda, Guest Relations Director of the Ritz Hotel☎️ Whether the room needs to be decorated and many other small details. I said that if you go to relax, you don’t need to decorate. Unexpectedly, when I checked in, I found that the room was covered with rose petals and there were folds on the bed. I bought a pair of elephants, as well as macarons, a welcome fruit plate, and a handwritten welcome card. It felt so ceremonial and really thoughtful. 8 bottles of water were customized by Baisui Mountain.

✨The waiters will greet you warmly when you come in and out.

✨ The car was parked on the negative 5th floor of Deji Phase 2. There was an elevator to the 1st floor of the hotel. Then I changed the elevator to the 38th floor. As soon as I got out of the elevator, a waiter took the initiative to carry my luggage and check in. I also got the 1166 executive lounge privileges. , and negotiated with the waiter from Saturday afternoon tea to Sunday lunch; when checking out, the waiter also asked whether he was satisfied with the check-in experience and whether he slept well at night.

✅Catering
🍴Nanjing Ritz’s executive lounge privileges of 1166 for two people are 5 meals a day which is super awesome‼ ️I was completely on the way to eat all kinds of food, and before I could digest this meal, I started eating again.

🔹Enjoy in the clouds in the executive lounge on the 58th floor. The floor-to-ceiling windows with wide views overlook the vast and spectacular city scenery of Nanjing, as well as the beautiful views of Xuanwu Lake and Purple Mountain❗️The lounge is comfortable and warm, and is provided by full-time concierges with warm, meticulous and thoughtful services.

🔸Breakfast: A combination of Chinese and Western, the duck blood vermicelli soup and pan-fried buns are very satisfying! Lunch: I can’t eat anymore; Afternoon tea: I’ll give you a set of three-layer pastries! Dinner: Spanish 5J ham🥩; Midnight: Free flow of cocktails at midnight. The 1,166 executive benefits are divided into five meals a day for two people. The Ritz’s products are actually very cost-effective.

💢The little lion went to the spa on the 40th floor to buy it. I bought the small size for 128 yuan as a souvenir.

msg:The location is very good. You can directly enter Deji Plaza on the first floor of the hotel. B1 is connected to Metro Line 2, which is very convenient. I stayed in a luxurious double bed on the 46th floor. The view was beautiful, especially the night view. The Ritz-Carlton has never let me down. The room service is attentive and considerate. Even during the Spring Festival, when the passenger flow surged, the service quality did not decrease at all.

He informed us of the driving route and parking location in advance before anyone arrived. When we checked in, he also helped us apply for Marriott membership with the supervisor and gave us free gifts. After breakfast for the children, after entering the room, he patiently introduced the functions of various facilities in detail. During this period, he also asked Lris many times to help deliver things. The little girl responded one by one. She is very dedicated to the Chinese New Year and chose a higher floor. ,very quiet.

The breakfast is very rich, and there are also God of Wealth and lion dance performances on the first day of the new year.

I sincerely thank Lris and every staff member and look forward to seeing you next time.

msg:What a great experience. In order to celebrate my birthday, I specially booked an executive king room. The room is really large. From the decoration and layout, you can feel the hotel's care and high requirements for quality and details. The large floor-to-ceiling windows capture the night view of Jinling City. All five meals in the executive lounge were checked in one by one. It felt like I was eating non-stop for these two days and one night. Although the variety of food in the restaurant is not particularly rich, it is enough to eat. For dinner, there is 5J ham with honeydew melon, salmon, etc. In the evening, I went to the spa to soak in the hot water and use the sauna, which completely relaxed me.
Finally, let me say something. Before I left, I was given a saltwater duck lion cub as a gift. I was so happy!

The hotel lobby is located on the 38th floor, creating a reception room for collectors.
The interior design is by Japanese Design Studio Spin (Kyoto was also designed by it) (the owner is Deji), and the "five elements" of gold, wood, water, fire, and earth in traditional Chinese culture are integrated into the interior design of the entire hotel in different forms.
The "plum blossom", the city flower of Nanjing, and the former site of Jiangning Weaving House not far away, also incorporate the brocade elements.

Five meals in the executive lounge:
Breakfast: A spectacular sunrise can be seen at sunrise
Afternoon tea: Although it is also a three-layer basket, the product feels very
Sweet
Happy hour: The legendary Iberian 5J ham and Veuve Clicquot Yellow Label champagne freeflow are impossible to eat and drink more
Evening sweet wine and desserts: Among the lounges I have experienced, it is considered perfunctory
During your stay, enjoy the hotel's special car free delivery service within three kilometers:
The surrounding areas of the Presidential Palace and Zhanyuan are within the scope of this service.

The environment and a**osphere are great, and the service awareness is even better. I give a real-name thumbs up to the little fairy Lris in the guest depar**ent, and call before checking in. I paid close attention to the check-in requirements over the phone. I arrived very late on the day of check-in and even went downstairs in the cold wind to greet and accompany me during the check-in. I felt the passion of the Ritz-Carlton, Nanjing. Starting from the gentle words of the little fairy Lris when she introduced the guest room, I felt Nanjing. The warmth of the Ritz-Carlton starts with the cold-repelling ginger tea prepared by Little Fairy Lris. The fatigue of the journey really needs to be soothed by the hottest heart. Little Fairy Lris’s heart must be kind and positive, even though she is just a little girl. Little fairy Lris will try her best to meet the request of bath salts. She will like every shining smile in life. Like the lovely little fairy Lris and bless everyone who is full of positive energy in ordinary life. Son~~~~

Before check-in, Ms. Mina from the guest awareness depar**ent called me to learn about the check-in time, preferences and needs. When I arrived at 12:30 on the day of check-in, I was immediately given a room with a very good view (the welcome tea provided during check-in was delicious). I also received a very thoughtful welcome card from Mina, a Ritz postcard and a particularly cute little Kong Fuzi lion. The children loved it, thank you very much~

Due to my husband's work, I was the only one who checked in with my children this time. Whether it was the concierge at the hotel door or the aunt who did the turndown service, almost every staff member I met showed "ceiling" level of professionalism. Thank you. Sumi’s little gift when checking out. Thank you Nan for taking care of me. We will definitely come back next time~

msg:It was a check-in experience that was not in line with the hotel's brand image. At the beginning, the hotel provided a very considerate check-in call and the scenery was quite good. But later, I would call twice to confirm the same thing. From the beginning, I felt that the management team seemed to be inconsistent, and there was a feeling that there seemed to be no service.
Secondly, I was asked twice about the time for afternoon tea when I checked in. The time was clearly stated when I checked in (one of the phone calls said that my afternoon tea had been cancelled?), but after it was delivered to the room, the front desk called again. Come and ask me if you can come for afternoon tea in the lobby. I guess I was confused about the check-in package. Then there is the scone for afternoon tea. After eating a mouthful of dough, I will explain later that the test indicator is to break it open with your hands and feel the temperature to see if it is warm... Normal scones are also crispy on the outside and soft on the inside... If you don't know, just ask. I just thought about it and forgot to let him try it himself :)

Finally, it is not recommended for friends who forget things easily. The wireless charger in the hotel room was broken and could not charge the watch. After checking out at around 1pm, I found that my watch had been left in the room at 5pm. When I asked for the first time at 5:10, I got a reply on the phone saying that I had looked for it but couldn’t find it. So when I returned to the hotel lobby to pick up my luggage, I confirmed it again for the second time. The same reply came back that I had searched carefully but couldn’t find it. They said that I would get the same thing if I asked at the front desk upstairs. result. Because I was sure it had been left on the bed, I insisted for the third time and asked if I had checked the bedding. After a while, I finally said I found it. Is this the service attitude and style of this hotel? And there was no apology or explanation. Finally, I was promised to send him downstairs in 5 minutes, but I still had to wait for nearly 20 minutes. And there is no indication or feedback on where to find it. If the guest left jewelry and watches, does such hasty cleaning of the guest room meet the standards declared by the hotel. I also advise friends who have high expectations for Nanjing🌰 to lower their expectations and be cautious.

msg:Go forward from the subway station, turn left after exiting the gate, then turn left again, and you will see the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (the subway sign is not obvious). No need to cross the street.

The hotel lobby is on the 38th floor, not the first floor.

I chose a double bed room for 2,390 a night, and a deposit of 1,000 was required upon check-in. I think the equivalent room in the Ritz-Carlton, Beijing is about 1,780. This one should be relatively new. When I checked in, I told the front desk that I didn't want the rooms on both sides. The front desk said that there were no double rooms that met my requirements. They would upgrade me to a mountain view room for free (around 2,500), but they were finishing the cleaning, which would take about half an hour. I went out for a walk and later received a call from the hotel saying that the room was ready. This is thoughtful.

In addition, I asked if I could send a yoga mat to the room. When I returned to the room, I found that what was delivered was from Lulu. This is also rare (the quality of yoga mats in many five-star hotels is very average)

There is a takeout cabinet on the right hand side of the first floor of the hotel. This is a little inconvenient because if you want to pick up food, you have to take an elevator to the 38th floor, then walk a little bit on the 38th floor and change to another elevator to get to the first floor to pick up the food.

The hotel room is almost perfect, except for 3 points, but the flaws are not hidden:

1. The hair dryer cannot be plugged into the bathroom socket;
2. The coffee machine produces the same amount of coffee in both large and small cups, but the large cup in the hotel is too small, and the small cup overflows. I don’t know why. Because I also have a Nesprsso coffee machine myself, the volume difference between large and small cups is very obvious;
3. Mimi bar drinks are charged, and there is no milk (I remember that non-alcoholic drinks are free in the Marriott Edition). Many other hotels have milk in the refrigerator (many guests actually need to use the coffee machine in the room to make milk) milk coffee)

Everything else is great, the environment is elegant and the room temperature is comfortable. The bed is high, the pillows and quilts are comfortable, and the mattress is not very soft. There are plenty of charging ports, plenty of paper towels, and plenty of drinking water. There is also a table to sit on in the bathroom.

Breakfast starts at 6 o'clock (but I chose no breakfast and I don't know how the breakfast is)

The mountain view room has a very good view and is a combination of wooden floors and carpets. The bathtub also has a great view. Personally, I think it's much better than the one in Beijing, so it makes sense that it's expensive.

The brands of room facilities are as follows:

1. Coffee machine Nestlé espresso capsule coffee machine
2. Bathrobes and bedding frette Italian bedding brand
3. Hair dryer Aliseo gmbh German brand
4. Toiletries diptyque phlosykos (Fig flavor)
5. Bluetooth speaker Tivoli Audio, an American brand, was founded in 2000 and has cooperated with Bulgari, the Ritz-Carlton Four Seasons W Hotel.
6. dinner plate treerings
7. Coffee cup asianera Asian Times
8. The model of the smart toilet Toto washlet is uncertain, and the toilet seat is hot.

She also specially sent a little lion and beautiful chocolates. The hotel's welcome fruits were finished and they were immediately replenished for us. During this period, we went to Pinning Mansion on the 39th floor for dinner twice. The dishes were very authentic. The squirrel mandarin fish was really delicious. The three of us Ningbo people don't like to eat sweets. Yes, I ate up a whole fish, and the sea urchin tofu, although it was a bit spicy (because I told the waiter when ordering that I didn’t want spicy food), it tasted really great! Unexpectedly, the chef came to our table later and apologized to us and offered to remake it for us. We were already full of food and wine, and we really couldn’t eat it. We also felt that there was no need to remake it. It was a waste of ingredients, so we decided to cook it again. We had so much fun one night that we went back the last night and it was packed on a Friday night! The prosperous business comes from the hotel's own service and dishes. It's no wonder it's not good! I have to stay in your hotel next time I go to Nanjing👍

Every employee greets you politely
I went to store my luggage in the morning when I arrived in Nanjing. After a busy day, I came to check in during dinner time. The box had already been delivered to the guest room.
According to my preference, the room faced the city center because I was out training all day long. When I returned to the room at night, I felt that it faced the lake or the mountain. It would be dark at night and there was nothing interesting to see.
I didn’t ask to arrange breakfast because I couldn’t catch up after going to bed late and getting up late, haha, but I went to Flair on the 62nd floor every night.
The room facilities are in good condition and no unusable conditions were found.
I used the laundry service once. I chose dry cleaning, but the clothes were marked as washable only. The front desk even called the front desk to confirm the replacement.
Little lion toy purchased at the spa center on the 40th floor

The itinerary was very tight and I didn’t get to experience much, but I was quite satisfied. The only flaw may be that the elevator from the lobby on the 1st floor to the reception on the 38th floor has a noticeable shaking feeling, especially when there are many passengers.

Finally, I would like to thank all the employees I met during these three days🫶

The only drawback is that the water in the shower room is relatively slow. After everyone washes, the dry area is flooded with water... The angle of the hand shower cannot be adjusted. As soon as I turn on the faucet, the cold water rushes straight towards the door. I am confused. The handheld shower is also a bit seriously damaged.
The room as a whole is still a bit stuffy, and the air quality is not the best. This may also be related to the interior material selection, which is quite heavy-duty and has leather everywhere.
The slippers are extremely soft! Good review!
Mineral water is also provided a lot
The hot water kettle feels a bit old and I don’t dare to use it.

Is the quality control of Ritz so poor?
btw there is another little episode
My friend booked the hotel for the wrong time. After negotiating with the hotel room to see if he could change the date, he was told that there was no room available and no solution was given. I had no choice but to cancel and rebook, and was charged an extra thousand for the room (even though it was my own problem, couldn't the hotel deal with it humanely?) I was really speechless.

The hotel service is very good. The housekeeper Kiki added WeChat in advance to inquire about our arrival time and responded quickly to our requests. Before leaving, I also gave gifts to the children, which was very thoughtful.

msg:The hotel is located in the CBD of the city. It is bright and shining. From the upper floors of the hotel, you can overlook a lake not far away. It is really rare. What is even more rare is the group of girls in the hotel. They use their enthusiasm to serve the guests staying in the hotel. They provide a full range of services to meet every need of the guests and are willing to help share, listen and solve problems. Among them, Doris, the deputy front office manager, helped to replace and upgrade noisy rooms, arrange birthday cakes and dessert fruit plates; Olivia sent a large bouquet of flowers, 99 delicate roses and little lions, etc. The wife was moved and excited beyond words. This must be the ceiling of gifts received by female guests. There is also Clara from the hotel's Guest Awareness Depar**ent who almost missed it. She was very careful when she found out that the guests were taking medicine and immediately provided pill boxes and eye masks. Also, the staff of the hotel's Chinese restaurant took the initiative to care about the guests' physical condition and provide various conveniences... There are many more. People often say that a hotel's decoration environment and hardware facilities are only superficial, while software improvements are the soul of a hotel brand. This check-in process is the best proof of this concept. I hope to see you again in the near future. meet.

I’m so enthusiastic that I’m almost embarrassed hahahaha! There are more people checking in on weekends. We arrived at two o'clock and went to eat, and the room was ready at almost four o'clock! Really considerate! Miss Grace is super nice! Real-name praise! She knew I was coming to JJ Lin’s concert and she drew a nice little card for me. It was so touching! Even though the weather was cold, they prepared ginger tea and bath supplies for me! Please ask the boss to give her a salary increase. Thank you. Hahahahaha. Come back next time!

msg:As a Ctrip Gold Diamond Card member, I chose the so-called best hotel in Nanjing. I booked it for three nights. Objectively speaking, the city view on the high floor is not bad, and the concierge staff are very proactive and enthusiastic. The room is not as big as it looks in the picture, and the sound insulation is poor. You can hear people talking in the corridor. The water temperature in the shower room was low, and I almost caught a cold when I took a shower in the morning😷 There was no hotel housekeeper to contact me. There was free fruit with Ctrip points when you checked in, but it was not delivered for the other days. All food and drinks in the minibar were chargeable, and there were no free snacks. It was much worse than hotels of the same price range. The breakfast was also very average, with poor taste and limited variety. I regretted booking breakfast for three days. The most outrageous thing is that it has been 2 days since I checked out, and the deposit has not been refunded. I called the hotel once to inquire about the deposit, but I was told to notify the hotel immediately to arrange a refund. Today has been four days and I almost forgot about it. I checked it again and still got the refund. Didn’t retreat. I have stayed in so many five-star hotels and this is the first time I encountered this. You hotel managers, don't just mark up the room rates to show that you are the best, you need to truly experience the guests' experience of staying in the hotel! Go learn more and learn how good hotels are made! Why do customers come to write negative reviews for you!

For my family's trip this time, the accommodation provided a very attentive and considerate service experience. I will stay at your hotel again when I have the opportunity to go to Nanjing.

Perhaps this is the original intention of the establishment of Ritz-Carlton, to give guests the highest courtesy. I was a little dissatisfied with the room we arranged at the beginning. Olivia changed our room directly. Everything was arranged very considerately and properly. The service did not make me feel pressured. It was really comfortable! I will come back next time. I have decided to only consider the Ritz-Carlton when I come to Nanjing from now on.

The service during the entire check-in process was timely and attentive. The hotel uses the characteristics of Nanjing, the ancient capital of the Six Dynasties, as decoration. "Five Elements Elements" and various "Nanjing Elements" run through every corner of the hotel. The designer also makes full use of "gold" elements in the hotel interior. All elevators to the guest room floors have to go through a 90-degree corner corridor, which fully demonstrates respect for the privacy of guests. The driver, Master Zhang, was very attentive. The executive car was spacious and comfortable. He prepared wet towels with essential oils, water, chargers, etc., and told almost all the stories about the scenic spots we could see along the way. From the moment you arrive at the hotel, the concierge will take the initiative to ask if you need help and guide you directly to the elevator. After reaching the 38th floor, transfer to the elevator to the 58th floor and quickly complete the check-in procedures. The room has many lotus and plum blossom elements, including works by the well-known painter Chen Qi, such as the Nenhe Hanlu tea set, bedside murals, lotus-shaped bedside lamps, and lotus bases of wall lamps... The hotel's bath supplies use Asprey series washing machines. Personal care products. The bathroom has double basins, German contemporary golden faucets, a large floor towel is thoughtfully placed under the basin, and the bathtub uses Kaldewei's steel plate. The guest room switch panel is very simple. 600-thread-count bedding, bath towels and bathrobes from Italy's Frette, the world's oldest luxury textile. Beauty's Rest Black Label Mattress by SIMMONS. TOTO's fully automatic washlet with golden control panel. The room is equipped with a capsule coffee machine, various coffee capsules, tea bags and coffee cups. The minibar provides a full set of drinks and cocktail preparation supplies. The executive lounge offers five meals a day, including breakfast, lunch, dinner, afternoon tea and late night snacks. The food is exquisite and rich in variety. The soup is delicious and tastes just like the soup made at home. It combines Chinese and Western styles and is rich in nutrition. And the most pleasant thing is that Ritz is really meticulous and attentive to the details in the restaurant. The floor manager Vera and the beauties responded very quickly. One day the coffee machine in the executive lounge was broken, and they took care of our nervousness. During the trip, we used coffee machines on other floors to make takeaway coffee, which shortened our time and the coffee tasted good. The gym, swimming pool, and spa are all beautiful and comfortable.

msg:It happened to be a birthday on a business trip, so I called my friends in Nanjing to visit the long-awaited Nanjing Ritz. Sure enough, the reputation is well-deserved, which makes me want to say more.
Although the hardware is good, I think what impresses me about this hotel is the people, 🌰 gentlemen and ladies.
In particular, I would like to thank Manager Cui, the manager on duty that day, for her professional and enthusiastic connection, for her just-right sense of distance, and for her decisive and warm crisis public relations.
At the same time, I would also like to thank the male manager who helped check in in the lounge, the chef lady who fried the salmon so deliciously for lunch, and the chef brother who enthusiastically helped cut the ham for dinner.
If it is a pity, it may be that I did not experience the breakfast in the main restaurant and the spa. I am looking forward to it!
Going to a city for a hotel, Nanjing Ritz, is worth it.

The scenery on the 47th floor is very good. Watching the sunset 🌇 I prefer this room type, Ritz Kids The wilderness exploration camping tent is very interesting. There are two children in my family.

This time, the butler Olivia and Zhang Yuhang’s thoughtful service added satisfaction points to the hotel. The butler contacted the hotel the day before check-in. I know that I brought two children, hand-painted welcome cards overnight, and prepared snacks! The breakfast is also arranged properly, which is really great! From check-in to check-out, Olivia greets and gives timely suggestions every day. She even gave the children hotel souvenirs when they left the store. I am so happy! The reason why a brand hotel can become a brand is the result of the hard work of every housekeeper like Olivia Zhang Yuhang! Awesome!

Both hardware and meals are online, the only shortcoming may be in the quality of service. It may be due to the epidemic. The waiters on the executive floor are very young. They may be young and inexperienced. They are very polite, but they feel that the service is not up to the point. As a guest, they can clearly feel that the service is not from the heart, or that the service It makes people feel less distracted. On the contrary, the service personnel in the ordinary lobby are a little more friendly and caring. Under the current market conditions, it is very important how to match the software with the hardware.

I was informed in advance that the baby was more than four months old and needed a crib and a baby bathtub. It turned out to be this kind of crib. How should we put it? The baby was sleeping, and I called the front desk many times to urge the front desk to deliver the crib. The service staff left immediately after delivering it! We were not told whether the crib had a trap door that could be lowered, nor was it told that such a small baby would have difficulty sleeping. Don't say that this was not within the waiter's responsibilities. If he just followed instructions step by step, he would be a robot! Where is your Ritz-Carlton corporate culture reflected? Such a high-star hotel doesn't even have a good brand of baby cot that can be used normally, and there is no detail service at all, which really ruins the brand! ! ! There are few varieties of breakfast, and the quality of linen is not worthy of the price of the room.

However, around nine o'clock in the evening on the first day, we had already fallen asleep. We vaguely heard the doorbell, followed by a loud knock on the door and the waiter asking if we needed to turn down the bed. After being disturbed, we could not fall asleep for a long time. The next day, I was informed again that the hotel did not need turndown service, but around 9pm, the waiter knocked on the door again and asked if I needed turndown service! This serious mistake happened two days in a row. We complained to the hotel and received only an apology but no reasonable explanation until we left the hotel. Really a disgrace to the Ritz-Carlton brand.

msg:The Ritz-Carlton, Nanjing is a high-end hotel in Nanjing. In the past, most of the hotels I stayed in when I went to Nanjing were business hotels. Since I am about to retire, my wife gave me this as a retirement gift (thank you)! I want to try a five-star hotel in Nanjing (haha).
The hotel is located on the 38th to 60th floors of Nanjing Deji Plaza (No. 18, Zhongshan Road). Transportation is by subway, bus, or self-driving. The free parking lot (B5, Deji Plaza) is the hotel parking lot (be sure to cancel your number at the 38th floor of the hotel front desk before leaving, otherwise you will be charged a parking fee, which is relatively high).
The hotel facilities are luxurious, heavy, and bright (after all, it is a five-star hotel).
In terms of service, the hotel will call you the day before check-in to contact you (the temporary housekeeper arranged by the hotel) to introduce the hotel situation and some personalized requirements of the guests (such as what type of tea to drink, whether to arrange pick-up, etc.). Whether it is the staff in the guest room, reception, catering, cleaning, etc., they all smile and greet the guests, giving them a feeling of being at home.
In terms of catering, there are many Chinese and Western dishes, and you can choose them yourself. The portion is not large, but it is enough to eat. The lunch and dinner fees can be settled in time or when you leave the hotel. Of course, a 10% service charge and a 6% tax will be charged. Remember to register a Marriott member when checking in, so you can enjoy a 10% discount on lunch and dinner. If you stay in an executive room, you can enjoy five meals (breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea, dinner, and evening bar), and the cost is already included in the room fee and will not be charged separately.
There are many types of guest rooms, including lake view rooms, mountain view rooms, executive rooms, suites, etc. Living in a room above the 38th floor, Nanjing city is full of high-rise buildings, everything is in sight, and the lights are dim at night. Enjoy it to the extreme.
If you go shopping, the elevator goes directly to Deji Plaza Phase I and Phase II. The shop door is in English, and basically no Chinese can be seen (I feel that there is no cultural confidence). Of course, the price is not cheap, so be prepared (haha).
Reminder: The bathtub has no handrails and is easy to slip (be careful when using it).
You can get to Xuanwu Lake Park by subway for 2 yuan.
In general, if you want to talk about the experience, 82 points, good and above.
Travel suggestions: A great place for business negotiations, especially for retirees to experience.

       Every time I stay at Ritz Nanjing, I always leave a good impression. The first time was when the hotel just opened, this time in April this year. We stayed in an executive double room, and the hotel arranged for us in every possible way. From the scenery outside the window to the arrangement of flowers in the room, drinks and bedding needs are very considerate. The room attendants are meticulous and thoughtful, and the arrangement of the executive lounge left a deep impression on us. The meals are rich in variety five times a day, and the dishes are exquisite and delicious. We are very satisfied with the warm, thoughtful and attentive waiters in the lounge! Especially for the elderly, we will try our best to do well. After learning that we like the little lion souvenirs of Nanjing Ritz, the room depar**ent of the hotel made careful arrangements, which moved us very much! When we come to Nanjing again, this is our best choice!

The location is easy to find. The hotel is grand, luxurious and stylish. The room is clean, large in size, reasonable in layout, well-decorated, classical in style, luxurious in style, and intelligent in facilities. The rooms are all above the 40th floor, with invincible views. The beds, pillows, and quilts are very comfortable. Everyone slept well for two nights.
The buffet breakfast has a comprehensive variety, excellent ingredients, and good taste, which is at the ceiling level in the industry.
What impresses me deeply is the thoughtful service. All the staff in welcome, lobby, front desk, restaurant, cleaning and so on, as well as the guy in the bar on the 62nd floor, are very polite, enthusiastic, skilled and professional.
Especially thanks to the housekeeper Dora, who contacted me before I checked in, introduced the hotel and asked about our check-in needs. It was the peak tourist season, and Dora tried her best to arrange the five rooms we booked on the same floor, and printed a set of introductions to Nanjing attractions and special snacks in advance and put them in each room, along with a check-in greeting card written by Dora herself. Warm and home away from home. When Dora knew that we might not have time to have breakfast when we went out to play early, she specially packed a set of breakfast, water, and yogurt for each of the eight of us, which was very thoughtful and touching. All in all, great!

msg:Self-driving to stop at Henderson B5, the only drawback is beyond my expectation, there is no charging pile.
The hotel is connected to the Henderson Mall to go shopping and buy big brands, which is very convenient
Buffet lunch for two in the executive lounge: Fried scallops, red wine beef and some other dishes are enough to eat, but there is no green leafy vegetable. It is recommended to add a green leafy vegetable for Chinese dinner to be more perfect
Breakfast for two in the executive lounge: the variety is not bad
Evening rum and dessert for two people in the executive lounge: red and white wine, beer and cocktails are available and the price is quite high. The dinner I stayed this night was lamb chops and spicy crabs. The lamb chops are very tender and have no smell, wrapped in a layer of pistachios Pieces, the spicy crab feels very spicy made with Huang Feihong peanut chili. overall ok
The executive room just feels that if you don’t go out to the hotel, it’s still quite cost-effective. After all, you have five meals, and you can go to the executive lounge to rest at any time. The service can be done on call.
Another imperfection is the maintenance of the swimming pool these days
The temperature of the steam room in the spa is not bad. It would be more perfect if we can add makeup remover and cleansing products for girls in the spa.
The scones for afternoon tea are not authentic enough and there is no ritz signature red velvet cake. PS, the correct placement of English afternoon tea should be that the bottom layer is salty sandwiches and the top layer is the sweetest, as if It's all reversed!

Hygiene: Hygiene is in place.
Service: very good. Especially the concierge, who opened the door with luggage in a timely manner. Room service is also prompt.
Facilities: Everything you need, in line with this price. It is that the design of some details is not very convenient and does not conform to usage habits. The decoration is very expensive, but the later maintenance is not very good, and there are many scratches on the socket panel.
The breakfast is very rich and the view is also very good. You can see the city view of Nanjing. The glass was wiped clean hahahaha.
The sound insulation in the room is also good. The air conditioner can be adjusted freely.
The hotel is very good, but the price/performance ratio is average, and the price is still slightly high.

msg:This spring is of unusual significance. After experiencing last year's blockade, I went on a retaliatory trip. This time I decided to go to Nanjing. Although the cherry blossoms are gone, there are still other spring colors. I chose to take my 75-year-old mother to stay at the Ritz-Carlton, Nanjing, the top hotel in Nanjing.
1 The location of the hotel is first-class, just at Deji Square in Xinjiekou. There are two subway lines for travel, which is very convenient, and the surrounding dining and shopping are very convenient.
2 The hotel is very new, and old hotels always have places that are not well maintained. The design of the hotel maintains the usual gorgeousness of the Ritz, and the interior of the house is in line with the design of the ancient capital of Jinling. Advanced facilities, smart toilets, and basin faucets are all luxurious. The water from the faucet is also quite large. The water flow of the shower is a little rush, and it is easy to splash out of the shower room, but this can't be changed for a while.
3 The hygienic situation is basically online. Some guests reported that there are hairs and uncleaned stains on the fabric sofa, which is a bit irritating. I hope that the room management of a luxury hotel can improve detail management in this regard. Hair cleaning is really troublesome, but as long as you pay more attention to it, you can still give guests a better experience.
4 The service is very considerate. Before checking in, I called to confirm whether the guests have special needs. This is very heartwarming. The room service response is very timely, and there are room butlers who specialize in solving problems. ASHLEY beauty provided information for my trip and introduced the use of various functions in the room. Thank you very much.
5 Catering: The Huaiyang cuisine in the Chinese restaurant at night is delicious and the ingredients are fresh. The portion is small, but enough for us with a small appetite. The price of the dishes includes the service charge, which is clear at a glance. The alcohol content is not high, but it is delicious. The environment is good, the service is good, the ingredients are fresh, and the dishes taste good. It is worth coming to eat.

The rice was so soft and glutinous. The sweet prawns are fresh and sweet with wasabi. My husband is allergic to prawns, so I reluctantly cooked the whole plate alone! We really didn't have the strength to eat the dessert + wine at the end of the night
There are not many types of breakfast. The small wontons are good. My husband ate two bowls
The main course for lunch is scallops and pasta, so-so, not as good as dinner
[Star R] Double SPA
I made an appoin**ent for a spa because I stayed in a hotel and didn’t want to go shopping.
The bubble pool overlooks the night view
I chose a golf massage, my heart was screaming crazily in pain, my husband didn’t make a sound, he must be screaming in his heart too [笑哭R]

In the hall, the uncle will remind you to cool down and wear more clothes
Vera in the executive lounge will talk to you about homework and thank Kelly for sending you rose petals and bath salts. Others don’t remember their names but they are very polite and they will greet you proactively. You can feel that the staff is well-trained. Finally, after checking out, my husband wants a set of bookmarks The staff searched for two floors before finding a set, and gave an extra small gift.

msg:After staying in the hotel's executive room, the benefits of the executive lounge include breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea, dinner, good night wine and dessert five meals a day, and you can stay at home for two days.
Due to a meeting in the afternoon of the next day, the room type was upgraded after check-in negotiation and check-out was delayed until 4 pm. The hotel service is very considerate.
Evaluation of five meals in the executive lounge:
Breakfast: The variety feels a little less. I don’t know if it’s because the food display and production area in the executive lounge is not big. The freshly cooked duck blood vermicelli soup vermicelli is not overcooked, and there is no a la carte content expected from the menu of a five-star hotel.
Lunch: The main course is a la carte grilled scallops and pasta with bolognese sauce, Japanese sashimi and sushi, 5 hot dishes, and 2 soups. The taste is good, the drinks include fruit juice, beer, soda water (Spanish brand, the bottle is super beautiful). The rice for the sushi that day was very hard, and there was no sushi vinegar added. I made a comment. The service feedback was due to the long time in the refrigerator. The sushi rice It should be cooked on the same day, hoping to improve.
Afternoon tea, three-layer inventory + salty snacks and scones
Dinner: The most valuable meal, main course: beef, beef tongue, foie gras a la carte, amazing Iberian 5J ham freshly cut, there is only one chef on site, and he often goes to get the ingredients to leave the operating area, or it is impossible to cut the ham Hot dishes need to be staffed quickly.
The administrative courtesy also includes a 3Km car, and I arranged a Mercedes-Benz business car when I left the hotel on the same day, which is very good.

During the Spring Festival, there is a package with champagne. What needs to be mentioned is that the hotel's FLAIR bar has been there once before. It is on the 62nd floor. The overall feeling is very good, especially a waiter surnamed Gu, who is enthusiastic and courteous, making people feel very comfortable.
It may be during the Spring Festival, the occupancy rate is relatively high, there are many guests, and you have to wait for a table at breakfast, which is not a good feeling.
In addition, the hotel is uncomfortable with parking, and it takes 20 minutes to wait for a parking space in the underground garage.

I ordered room service at the hotel at noon, and the price of the food was very high, even if it was high, and the portion was very small, even if it was less, the main reason was that it was unpalatable. Speaking of time, the standard of this kind of food is not up to the standard of a five-star hotel. 1500 for 7 dishes, we only ordered 1 hard dish, and the others were all small dishes. Really worthless, no need to go

The location is very good, the premium room can overlook the whole of Nanjing, but unfortunately there is fog the next day, and it feels like fairy fog. The spa in the pool is very enjoyable for mothers. It can be reserved during the day, there are towels and slippers along the way, and the automatic jacuzzi can overlook the city view. Everything in the dressing room is exquisite. There are also a variety of delicious choices in Daiwadji Square on New Year's Eve. You don't have to go out when it's raining or cold. It belongs to the hotels that mothers can enjoy, and children can play in the six dynasties, the city wall, and various hotels in Nanbo. Life is also convenient.
In the breakfast on the first day of the new year, I was pleasantly surprised to see a lion dance performance. Some people also got room 38 and all the way from the first floor when checking in and leaving. So the service is pretty good. It's the breakfast that I feel a little sorry for the price.

Basically everything is good except expensive. I feel that it is suitable for business trips alone, with children, and couples.
I encountered some problems when registering for administrative benefits, and Ctrip quickly communicated and resolved them. Will continue to book with Ctrip.

Checking in before the Spring Festival, the check-in time was long, there was no smile during the whole process, and it was not friendly to children. The first sentence is to tell the children not to touch the high stool where the bag is placed, but the child just puts his hand on the stool. 2. Knowing that there are children staying, the children's toothbrushes and slippers need to be called many times to be delivered. 3. The decoration smells very strong and it is not recommended to bring children in. 4. The swimming pool is not clean. 4. The breakfast has many cold items and few hot dishes. It only focuses on the beautiful presentation and ignores the type of food itself. 5. The hotel parking lot is connected to the shopping mall next to it. It is difficult to park and find the entrance. The road is often closed at night. 6. The service staff has no sense of service at all.

Whether it is the furniture in the room, the washing utensils, the shoehorn to the mattress, it all reflects her ingenuity. In the executive lounge, there are a group of handsome men and women who are passionate about work. On the day of check-out, I would like to express my thanks (I had a cold the day before, so I asked the lounge to help cook the porridge, and the staff brought the hot porridge to the bed within 20 minutes. I also took care of my husband and I to drink early. The whole process Service with a smile.), came to the service desk of the executive lounge, and met the manager Bonnie. She hopes that the executive lounge can give every guest the best experience at RITZ. I think I've felt it. When I came to the lounge again on the second day when I was not feeling well, the male service staff (sorry forgot the name) who was on duty that day was very concerned about my recovery. Several other service staff will also come to ask if I feel better. The chef will also recommend that you drink more porridge today. The whole team made me feel very caring. If I come to Nanjing next time, their service is the most important reason for me to choose RITZ.

The hotel is in the city center, upstairs of Deji Square. The downstairs can be directly connected to Deji Square. It is very convenient to go shopping in the high and cold winter.
Room view:
The hotel should be the tallest building in the urban area, overlooking the entire Jinling City and Xuanwu Lake. When the weather is good, I also saw the sunset.

Room facilities:
The facilities in the room are all available and very user-friendly. It is the electric curtain that seems to be broken, and the response is not sensitive. In addition, the lighting effect of the room is full of a**osphere.
Gym:
The gym is also a sight to see all the mountains and small ones. The equipment is very complete and new. The swimming pool is also a standard lane with constant temperature.

breakfast:
The breakfast is rich and the dining environment is very comfortable. Chinese and Western styles, authentic Nanjing snacks are dazzling. It's the 148 bowl of beef noodles at zero in the guest room, which makes me feel that it is not of the standard of Ritz-Carlton, it is relatively ordinary. what.

Cost performance:
Such an environment, service and dining landscape, on the whole, still matches the Ritz-Carlton's signature, and it is also worth the price.

Every time I choose the executive floor, first of all, it is very quiet and there are not many people, and you don’t need to go out of the hotel if you bring your baby. The executive lounge can solve all the problems of eating. Although there are not many varieties, it is better than exquisite. The staff are very warm and polite, and the stay is very pleasant. My daughter is very happy and loves all kinds of food and drink in the executive lounge.

The only dissatisfaction is that the administrative courtesy is really bad, the food is very small and really not tasty, the first day reflected that the second day was still old and dying sea bass, the service was relatively poor, and the internal connection was not perfect, which caused customers Various 39th and 58th floors are running around, and the service during meals and afternoon tea is also very unfamiliar. There is no introduction and the service is just collecting the plates very frequently. I will go to the hotel again for the administrative courtesy. IQ tax is too high and I will not buy it again. With this money, it is better to eat something else around. It is not recommended.

Downstairs is the best shopping mall in the area: Deji Plaza, and there is an art gallery on the top floor of the square that is worth visiting.

Enjoyed a semi-buffet lunch and breakfast in the all-day restaurant, and Western food baking is the strength of this restaurant. The most delicious is the macaron, which has a variety of flavors.

This hotel is suitable for soaking, the swimming pool environment is beautiful, and the fitness equipment is too complete. They are all Italian brands that I love. There's also a sauna to soothe.

The room is upgraded to a lake view room, the internal hardware is superb, and all the cabinets are designed with hidden secrets.

The bar on the top floor specializes in Southeast Asian cuisine, and you can buy a discounted set meal in Dianping, which tastes good and has ample quantity.

I have to say that the service here is impeccable.

The sweetness is really sweet, and the deliciousness is really delicious😋 The handwritten card instantly fills up the favorability~
Ritz’s service is still as stable as ever. Sylvie from the guest relations depar**ent sent me to the room. She communicated cordially throughout the whole process and responded to and resolved the requests immediately. I accidentally broke a red wine glass because it was broken on the small coffee table. When I checked out, I told the cleaning service staff to pay attention to safety~ The first reaction of the front desk was to immediately ask me if I was injured and if I needed any help. It was still very warm~ Maybe a good hotel wins in the details, anyway I am someone who is willing to pay for the favor I get at a certain moment~
The only uncomfortable thing about this stay is that when I went to Pinning Mansion for dinner at night, the elevator was so fragrant that I felt like I was suffocating...
In the end, the glasses were left in the room. The guest room contacted me before I found out. I will take some time to pick them up in two days, and I can have a meal by the way😍

msg:The Ritz-Carlton, Nanjing

✅Summary: I am a Ctrip Black Diamond VIP and have been booking hotels on Ctrip for many years. The Ritz-Carlton, Nanjing is my favorite hotel in Nanjing. The geographical location here is very advantageous. It is located in Deji Square in the city center, with convenient transportation and convenient shopping. Whether it is for business people or family travel, this is the best choice after arriving in Nanjing. As long as I come to Nanjing, I will choose to stay here.

💁‍♂️Service: The service of Lion King Hotel has always been considerate and meticulous. He Weiyi, the front desk staff, was very attentive, quick and efficient. The door boy handsome Abel is tall and handsome, and looks full of energy. The housekeeper Zhang Jian saw that I was wearing sunglasses, so he took the initiative to send a disposable glasses wipe. I also saw my old friend Huang Meng. The hotel prepared welcome fruit for me, I like bananas, so they brought some extra bananas. The breakfast is rich in variety and styles, combining Chinese and Western styles.

🏠Guest room: What impresses me more is that there are many books in the guest room, such as "The Collection of Monet", "Nanjing People", "Drafts of Da Vinci" and the original edition of the world famous book "Moby Dick". loved by me. Matching coffee, Tieguanyin tea and wine are readily available. Lying in the bathtub, you can see the beautiful skyline of Nanjing city, and the Zifeng Building not far away is soaring into the clouds.

💪 Fitness: I use the gym and swimming pool every day. The gym is clean and bright, the venue is spacious, and the equipment is advanced and complete, all of which are made by the Italian brand Technogym. The swimming pool is exquisite and small, the water is clear and clean, and there are not many people at ordinary times.

❤️Summary: The Ritz-Carlton, Nanjing fully met all my expectations. Will still choose to stay next time.

msg:I originally went for the Ritz brand, but I really advise everyone to be cautious. I don't think there is anything to say about hardware. After all, there are standards for reference. Parking and traffic at the hotel are a big problem. If you are driving, it is recommended to directly opposite the Asia Pacific Business Building of Jinling Hotel. Every time I choose Nanjing, it is very good. The parking fee is 20 yuan, and it takes less than five minutes to park the car and enter the Lobby. . The ritz that shares the same parking lot with Deji is amazing. We circled around Xinjiekou at noon on Saturday for about 40 minutes. We couldn’t wait for a parking space. We finally got in. It was still in the open air and the summer sun was shining We were in a panic. But the service of the software can be said very much. First of all, the service of the executive lounge is really a bit lacking. In the case of many customers, the lack of experience and the smooth reception process give me a lot of problems for this guest who does not understand. , Why is there no tissue paper on each table, the staff took it for about 20 minutes and still found it by myself, why did we have afternoon tea before our later guests, the children at our table kept saying they were hungry, and I kept comforting them. Since lunch is provided, why do some children have chopsticks on the 38th floor but not on the 58th floor? (In the end, this problem was solved, and the staff helped to get chopsticks from the 38th floor). Maybe I'm having a hard time. The eldest sister in the room service was also a bit funny. We asked her to help with the toothbrush and toothpaste of the children. She told me that there was no more, and gave me an adult. I was stunned when I received it, so I accepted it and called again the next morning Room service, once again asked the staff to take the children's toothbrush and toothpaste, and again. During the peak season of summer vacation, the service of the executive lounge cannot keep up, which is understandable, but there is no need to be tolerant. If such a problem occurs, I hope Ritz can consider how to ensure the high service level of customer satisfaction. Improve efficiency, after all, it is also an old brand of luxury hotels.

The bread for breakfast is really average. Those who like to eat Western-style breakfast will be a little disappointed. The afternoon tea is not bad, but the dessert is too sweet, but lunch and dinner are not bad~
There is one thing to say that the service is not as good as Sanya. I don't feel any thoughtful care, and the manpower seems to be a little insufficient. . . Trying to find someone to help during the peak meal time will have to cut your throat or wait for a while. . . The most outrageous thing is that there are a lot of business people staying in the administrative level, and they even saw the social animal conductor who was dining in the executive lounge serving her boss. As a social animal, I felt a sense of sincerity and fear only in work when I was on vacation. . . I was embarrassed to bother them watching the service staff walking in a hurry. . .

During the stay in the hotel, it was the baby's birthday, and the staff of Carlton Hotel carefully prepared handwritten greeting cards, gifts, cakes and other surprises. As soon as you enter the lobby, you are treated as a VIP. The baby said that it is amazing. Thank you for the warm and friendly staff of the Ritz-Carlton Hotel. You are so attentive! The kids are replying to you!

Those who came to take the IELTS specially prepared delicious food for me😋! I'm so happy to have received a greeting card wishing me a good exam! I'm really careful. The sound of the hotel is not poking and playing songs. I feel that the best point of the hotel should be the large floor-to-ceiling windows. In the evening, you can immerse yourself in the sunset. Flair on the 62nd floor also went to have a light drink. The evaluation is not bad but not Shanghai. 🌰 The Flair landscape is good. It is worth mentioning that the service is also good! ! The breakfast is also very delicious. I only ate a little bit because of the exam 💔 Next time I go to live, I will eat it again and have afternoon tea by the way

🧹Room: The layout is reasonable and the room facilities are relatively new.

🔔Service: Check-in is very fast, front desk staff is very patient and answering questions. The staff of the swimming pool will take the initiative to tell you where to get mineral water and fruit and briefly introduce the fitness facilities.

💥Dissatisfaction: When eating breakfast, I feel that there are insufficient staff and management is chaotic. Met a female service staff with glasses, obviously working with emotions. Asking her to help with the condiments, she turned around and left with an impatient face and no response, frowning. Every staff member was in a hurry, and they had to wait for a long time to find a waiter to clear the table, and contacted two different staff before finally clearing it up.

🍃Before breakfast, I was quite satisfied with all aspects of the hotel. Many points are deducted after breakfast, and the service still needs to be improved.

The only dissatisfaction is the western restaurant. The first time I went to dinner, it took a long time to confirm that we were allowed in at the door. The speed of the meal was extremely slow. The second time I went to have breakfast, I didn't ask what I wanted to drink when I got in.

Taking advantage of the May Day holiday, the Ritz dream was finally fulfilled. Ritz's service is really nothing to say. From the moment you enter the door, you have been surrounded by the words "home away from home". The service staff are courteous wherever you go. Even if you encounter a small episode in the ordering process, you can deal with it in time. The view of the room is quite good. It is far away from Jinling Hotel. The scenery outside the window is pleasant at night. It is very comfortable to lie in the bathtub and enjoy the night sky. A very good experience.

msg:I couldn’t leave Nanjing during New Year’s Day, so I was going to book a hotel in Nanjing to relax. I struggled with the five-star hotels in Xinjiekou and finally chose Ritz. It was the first time I stayed at a Marriott-owned hotel. In general, There is indeed a better experience than other traditional five-stars. Different people have different opinions in terms of style and a**osphere, which are more in line with my preferences. In terms of layout design, the advantages of the building are basically used to the greatest extent, and they are more distinctive. To provide some reference for choosing the room type later, it should be said that the basic types of rooms are basically the same, only the difference in floor and left-right symmetry. The so-called lake view is overlooking Xuanwu Lake, facing north, and the mountain view should be far away. The view of Zijin Mountain is towards the northeast, so although the two types of units are mainly city view, the scenery of Xinjiekou is not very visible. The one facing southwest should face Xinjiekou. The service is relatively in place. The mineral water for the pillows in the guest room came quickly, and there were some minor defects. When I came to check in, the room was not cleaned. I waited from two o'clock to four o'clock, and breakfast was more than nine o'clock. The small ones waited for a while, and the taste of afternoon tea in the lobby bar can be improved. The flaws are not concealed. Next time I have the opportunity, I will consider choosing Ritz. Also, I later saw that it was said that Ritz’s room card could be left as a souvenir or collection. This time I forgot to ask, I hope I have a chance.

I didn't see anything special about this lake view, so I don't recommend you to buy it at a higher price. The package includes breakfast and executive lounge, and one afternoon tea is delivered within 3km and can be delivered to the room. The front desk and I explained that I could not have afternoon tea because the cream would make me diarrhea. And want to change to the 62nd floor bar or room service. The front desk said it was ok. Because I had a meeting when I checked in that day, and I didn't eat anything on the road. When I ordered room service after arriving in the room, the executive lounge began to say that it could not be served, and only afternoon tea was available. Then the first time the socket in the room was broken, I had to flush my phone in the toilet, because there was a meeting later, I was hungry and did not go to the front desk to explain the situation. In the end, although the room type was upgraded, I was not very satisfied with the compensation given by the manager on duty that day. On the contrary, it was a male manager on the last day I felt better than the female manager on the first day. It was an unpleasant experience anyway...

msg:The beautiful land in the south of the Yangtze River, the imperial state of Jinling. As the ancient capital of the Six Dynasties, Nanjing folks have always preferred the "lion" with a very imperial style. Therefore, the arrival of the "Lion King" Ritz-Carlton is an "inevitability". [The Ritz-Carlton, Nanjing] is interpreting the elegance and elegance of the "historic city" Nanjing. It is not only a city with profound historical and cultural heritage, but also a vibrant modern city that blends ancient and modern. Nestled high in the center of the "Deji" in the prosperous area of Nanjing, it combines the "ancient temperament" and "the spirit of a gentleman and a lady" just right.

Adhering to the brand's consistent low-key luxury, even the sculptures on the entrance square of the hotel are of great origin - the 3m-high white sculpture "Rhythm" is made of a whole piece of Italian Carrara marble. Michelangelo's famous "Rhythm" David was also carved from this extremely precious material. The 10 century-old pine trees next to the sculpture were also airlifted from Japan on a special trip, cutting off the hustle and bustle of the bustling shopping mall next door.

The hotel lobby is located on the 38F. The overall decoration style inherits the long history and culture of Nanjing. It combines oriental aesthetics with western classics ingeniously, showing elegant beauty everywhere, aiming to create a "collector's living room". Nanjing's city flower "Plum Blossom" can also be seen everywhere in the hotel. It is not depicted on a flat painting, but is displayed in three-dimensional, or carved, or hollowed out forms, so realistic that it seems that you can smell the fragrance of February.

This time I stayed in the "Executive Deluxe King Room" room type on 58F, and enjoyed the benefits of the Executive Lounge (58F) throughout! Perfect ending as the last stop of the Nanjing hotel line!

Address: No. 18, Zhongshan Road, Xuanwu District, Nanjing City, Jiangsu Province

The service environment is great. It was a newly opened hotel last year. The lobby has a Chris**as a**osphere. The a**osphere is great~ My husband and I booked a panoramic room to lie down and watch the sunrise. It’s worth it👏🏻👏🏻
The hotel's afternoon tea is also very cost-effective. Marriott members can get 20% off. The spa is a pleasant experience. It's full of ten stars. It's great. The room facilities are complete. The room service is 👏🏻 and the cleaning is very good. clean

All the staff encountered showed extremely high professionalism, polite, warm and caring, and the service really "thinks what you think". I would like to pay special tribute to the girl Sumi at the front desk for her enthusiasm. She hand-written a birthday card for my wife and personally sent a small birthday cake to the room. I was very touched! In short, from hardware to software, it is an unforgettable and beautiful experience. Have a membership card and look forward to the next stay!

msg:A luxury hotel with advanced facilities and complete facilities. The Ritz in Nanjing has a higher-end design style and taste than Beijing and Shanghai! It's just that the lobby is dark and the lighting is not good. It gives guests a bad first impression. The front desk service needs to be improved. One sip negation set two glasses of wine, only 15% off consumption. After leaving, I asked Ctrip. I felt that Ctrip was sincere and repaid. The hotel said that it compensated for the souvenirs, and I felt that those after leaving were completely meaningless.

Second, due to my negligence, I left an out-of-print umbrella in the rental. In the car, I asked the hotel to contact the taxi driver with the mentality of giving it a try. The hotel concierge spent a few hours looking for me and returned the umbrella to my room; third, I knew we were sending the child to my room. When studying in Southeast University, the concierge specially hand-painted greeting cards and sent them to the room. The details reflect the level of service, and the trip to Nanjing feels warm.

As soon as you enter the door, the curtain will automatically rise, and then you can see the long-distance view of the high-rise building at Xinjiekou~ When you open the toilet door, the toilet lid will also automatically rise. The attendants in the gym on the 40th floor are very polite, enthusiastic and thoughtful. This feels very intimate. The gym is good, the equipment is very new, the swimming pool has a Southeast Asian style, the monstera leaves are super big, and the most favorite is the jacuzzi, which is super comfortable. ~~~ The breakfast environment is also great, I had a good meal, but I didn’t find moon cakes after walking around on the Mid-Autumn Festival, okay... the house has a large space, and all the waiters are very polite and praise one!

You need to pay attention to small details
Maybe it’s because I live in that room with few people
The remote control machine next to the bathtub is dusty
The menu box in the room is also dusty
Touch a bar 😂
I don’t know how to adjust the water temperature in the shower, it doesn’t feel very hot 🥲
Fortunately, the hot weather is not a big problem.
The scenery is also pretty good

Convenient transportation, the hotel is directly connected to Deji.

msg:The most expensive hotel in Nanjing is well-deserved, located in Xinjiekou, extending in all directions, opposite to the 37-story building, all indicators are fully up to the standard hotel, completely at the category 6 or 7, the service is meticulous, the front desk service is efficient, and the front desk lady sister The chat was very pleasant, a very well-trained young lady, the concierge and the room service are of good quality, and take the initiative to ask the guests hello. When going downstairs to Deji Phase II, different staff will greet you if you have any needs, two lobby staff Many people feel the warmth of the Ritz-Carlton back then. The centralized training management is still good. The service is very flexible, the words are timely, the exchanges and conversations are natural, and they are all cultivated. They are all well-trained for traffic information, check-in policies, travel itineraries and precautions. Very familiar. Among them, there are many gentlemen and ladies transferred from Shanghai, but during the summer vacation, the pool length is a little shorter, and there are many swimmers, basically all for parents and children. Only in the early or early afternoon, there is a complete lane to swim. , When the water is changed every day, the swimming pool hardware is still very good, the gym is open 24 hours, the cleaning is also timely, and there are many people exercising. But it is the summer vacation. There are so many guests for parent-child trips and family outings. In addition to the main body of the hotel, there are few business guests but it is very suitable for business travel. The room layout combines the simplicity of Japanese style and the magnificent a**osphere of Chinese style. It is very delicate and elegant. The room view is very good, the lighting settings are warm and bright, and the room is well equipped with anti-skid Slippers, bedding standards, breakfast types are available, the products are fresh and good quality, the new products will be specially prepared to ask the guests if they need them, the attitude is very good, the quality of the eggs Benedict made by the omelette chef is good, and the breakfast also has noodles Stall, the best breakfast is freshly cooked, eat freshly cooked!


Disadvantages: It’s a pity that the welcome gift is not big enough after turning down, and I am a little disappointed. There is also a need for the G-level management team of the concierge to guide the vehicle. Entering the main entrance of the hotel, the vehicle is chaotic, whether it is a social vehicle or a taxi, unguided, and parking Very troublesome, the service of the concierge to pick up and drop off the guests is not flexible enough. Many guests who arrive and leave the shop seem to be underestimated. They may still need to run-in. Sometimes the concierge is helping to do things, which seems very unnatural. Yes, of course this is only for the various indicators of the brand and price.
It is also a small episode, which does not conceal the patient service and dedication of every staff member.

The Ritz-Carlton, Nanjing is still in the center of the city and still tops Jinling City!

I hope that the hotel can do better in all aspects, and go to Kangzhuang Avenue!

Then he told me that because the number of rooms reserved for the lake view room is relatively small, there is no room yet, so I need to wait a little longer. I will store my luggage and go to Deji downstairs to go shopping. In the evening, I got the room card and entered the room to see that the decoration was still full of high quality. The children were attracted by the floor-to-ceiling windows. The large water outlet of the bathtub is also a must-have for bathing. It is also equipped with cushion pillows. The bedding is also very comfortable. The twin beds of our two large and two small stays are comfortable with a bed fence. The breakfast is also very rich and exquisite. It's that Nanjing is too hot and I couldn't run the scenic spots. I will go there next time I have a chance.

Two workers, one in charge, had been repaired in our room and hadn't repaired it. Both restaurants are good, the Chinese restaurant tastes good, and they offer discounts on their own initiative. In short, the Ritz-Carlton in Nanjing is disappointed and will not go again.

設施：很人性化，房間自帶無線充解了燃眉之急
衞生：因為本人有點潔癖，這家是我住下來連浴室地面角角落落都一塵不染擦的很乾凈的酒店
環境：在德基樓上，周圍購物吃飯都很方便
服務：遇到的工作人員都很客氣有禮，每次進出酒店都有人打招呼，雖然酒店大堂在38層，但臨走時寄存行李可以去一樓取，非常周到和人性化

不足的是床的正上方有個煙霧報警裝置晚上一直在閃爍影響睡眠，還好Doreen提前準備了眼罩。前台的Julie也特別分享了去秦淮河岸的攻略。一樓大堂的門衞們也非常熱情，整個酒店讓人印象最深刻的就是服務水平高，讓人覺得賓至如歸，甚至比很多私人管家型酒店的服務更好。
早餐很喜歡，南京菜中規中矩，粵菜餐廳因為一個人點了唯一的套餐，但是感覺菜單設計的不太好，好幾道的口感都偏黏膩的質感，比較雷同，希望未來能有改進。

可能酒店太火了住的人多，感覺房間保養有點不足，我住的房間的畫都有些抽絲了，像那種被風化的殘破。衞生間低頭刷牙的時候會發現一些衞生死角，但基本影響不大。
在卓美亞的餐飲體驗不太好，對麗思就更期待。出品確實不錯，雖然小種類少，但基本沒什麼踩雷的。晚餐旁邊桌的小姐姐説火腿好吃，在卓美亞的火腿吃的我要yue，就又試了試麗思的火腿，肉眼可見的顏色更深更幹，嚼得很香。
豉油雞很棒，感覺他們家的帝粵軒也可以嘗試。如果不想自己選吃哪家，選行政房確實可以省去很多選擇困擾。
話説行政酒廊的經理李澤金，就是歡迎卡片上的那位，長得超像我的初中班主任，特別是做事的時候眉頭緊鎖超嚴格的，但是服務很好，從第一餐下午茶到早餐都有看到她一直在忙，辛苦了。

麗思卡爾頓酒店房間寬敞明亮，設計時尚大氣，床鋪非常舒適，可以用睡在棉花堡一樣的軟暖形容。酒店就餐環境豪華典雅，中西餐食非常豐富且味道正宗。最讓我們感到温暖的是，接待的員工們熱情周到！在此也特別感謝賓客認知部的Lris，服務貼心細緻，完美詮釋了一家五星級酒店服務人員的專業素質。酒店還提供了豐富的新鮮水果和小紀念品服務，給我和朋友的旅途增添愉悦！

msg:酒店設計和硬件方面很豪華，位置優越，連接德基廣場。出行都特別方便
服務方面服務人員很多，遇見都能禮貌打招呼，但也僅此而已談不上很周到，沒有賓至如歸，體貼親切感。服務人員的待客態度也是參差不齊，有的專業，有些給人就是程式化的假笑，

環境：酒店大堂電梯裏都是香的，但一走出電梯客房過道包括進到房間都有種怪怪不好聞的氣味，空氣沒有那麼清新。房間內飾就是豪華，但佈局方面本人覺得一般，記憶點就是視野很好。

早餐自助，也許期望過高，實際口味方面感覺很普通，沒有啥特色無記憶點，水果品種也不多，品質一般。

房間裝修有特色，比較新，設施設備有科技感，使用方便，衞生不錯。春節期間趕上情人節，酒店還送了玫瑰花和巧克力。點贊！
當然，價格與服務也是成正比的，但感覺也是物有所值。遇到的所有服務人員都會主動跟客人打招呼。第一天到大堂還有位中年服務員在我們等電梯的時候很熱情的介紹南京的概況，讓人感覺很親切熱情。
總體來説，非常推薦，會是我再去南京住宿的首選。

房間挺大，我也是第一次住麗思卡爾頓，各方面都還算不錯。
提前一天預約了下午茶，比原本到達時間遲了一個小時。最後選擇在房間吃了，酒店小哥哥的顏值真的都非常在線，哈哈哈哈。
第二天吃早餐也是會很貼心帶領你到空位，而不是讓你自己盲目的找空位就餐。

  一樓大廳內有個側小門通往德基2期。
  馬桶是智能的，自動翻蓋和關蓋，這點很贊。
  冰箱飲料是收費的
  我們住了2晚，第3晚想用老價錢續住，酒店沒同意，説要按現價。感覺有點死板了。多增加幾百元，實在內心不甘。就轉去了凱賓斯基酒店，少一半多錢。去了後就發現，其實就是睡一覺，沒啥必要住得那麼貴的。來旅遊的，就是睡一覺，早上出去。中午回來就退房。以後也要考慮用中高端即可，不用住當地最貴的了。

msg:早些年在香港麗思，因為那傲慢的服務態度，讓我一直對麗思有所“偏見”，雖然各大品牌，各系列酒店基本住了個遍，但選擇麗思的次數不多。很久沒來南京，這次衹是飛機中轉，但傳言南京最好的酒店，而且這個價格，還是新酒店，我覺得對麗思卡爾頓的品牌而言，性價比很高，所以我選擇停留一晚，為了一個酒店！
入住後果真名不虛傳，無論地理位置還是內部軟硬件設施和服務水平，真的無可挑剔。新中式風格，房間佈局合理還帶點小心機，特別是浴缸邊的扶手和落地窗邊的沙發躺椅，很貼心。各種裝修裝飾用材奢華又雅緻，不愧是萬豪裏的頭牌，我個人覺得把近些年新開的希爾頓品牌的華爾道夫和凱悦品牌的柏悦拿出來對比，南京麗思卡爾頓依然穩操勝券。
體驗了FLAIR晚餐和雞尾酒，出品很高。自助早餐，中餐偏少了些，但總體品質都很高，總算找到了能跟奢華品牌匹配的早餐出品（一個酒店早餐質量高不高，最簡單的就是看他們的白粥）。
提個建議吧：套餐包含FLAIR三道式晚餐，其實份量很大，而且有的菜有搭配主食，一個人完全夠吃，但菜單裏沒標明哪些菜含主食，服務員也沒提示，我擔心不夠吃，自己加了兩個菜，廚師擔心我等太久，又送了一道菜，我也不好意思退，可完全吃不完，太浪費。建議菜單標詳細一點，或者服務員要主動提示，以免不必要的浪費。還有，總體口味都偏甜，容易膩，這是南京特色嗎？

msg:投訴“南京麗思卡爾頓酒店”服務，迄今為止最糟糕的一次酒店入住體驗，好歹我也是攜程黑鑽用户（每年僅在攜程消費超過100萬），而且全球的其他麗思卡爾頓酒店我很多也都住過，沒遇到這麼傻的體驗；我本人於晚上17點48分左右到38樓前台開房，手續辦完後告知我房卡給不了我，因為打掃的緣故 要過幾個小時給我房卡，拜託！我是將近6點來開房，不是下午2點多過來好嗎？你們打掃這麼慢，然後告訴我有其他房型空着（雖然是一間套房），那應該給我升級啊。不升級，讓我等着，最後經過了在我不停催促的20來分鐘時間後，終於拿到了房卡，連個道歉也沒有（自從開始有不爽開始，我就開始錄音了，且告知了前台我在錄音）：
	
1、如果現在給不了房卡，應該在辦理入住前告知；而不是等在收取按金，辦理完人臉識別等各種手續後告知；此居心何在？
	
2、客人晚上6點來入住，不能拿房卡，是酒店的問題，不是客人的問題；另外已經告知前台我的手機任何來電都會被設定自動掛斷的；
	
3、有空餘房型應該給急需入住的賓客升級入住，明明有，但不給；
	
4、耽擱了客人20分鐘時間，給我房卡時沒有任何道歉；
	
5、最後我問前台除了38樓有洗手間外，1樓你們大堂有沒有，告知有，結果到了1樓告知沒有，這是在玩我嗎？
	
其他酒店即使有偶爾無法入住，需要等待的事情，也是客客氣氣，爭得顧客同意後或其他應急方案，而且也不會到晚上6點來也無法入住。
	
為了幫助酒店改善服務質量以及不再讓其他賓客有如此遭遇，本投訴將發送至大眾點評，攜程，南京市旅遊局，麗思卡爾頓全球總部等近百個相關部門

入住時的服務很nice，升級了房型，之後就沒有服務可言了。雖然入住前一天打了電話知悉需要準備小童用品，但還是在入住後才慌慌張張送備品過來；歡迎水果同上；入住三晚衹開了一次夜床；打過一次服務中心電話，大概是晚上九點左右，等待很久才有人接聽，態度非常非常非常非常不熱情，聲音就跟剛睡醒一樣，問問題也是愛回不回死氣沉沉，這種服務真的不敢相信。
房間內中央空調聲音很大，電源插口不好使，窗簾按鈕不靈敏，電視牆有很明顯的成片成片的水痕，沙發邊的小桌子感覺是陳年污垢怎麼都擦不乾淨，礦泉水提供的是百歲山，燒水壺電吹風我也不懂。
但這一切在下樓感受了德基的臟亂差以後好像也沒什麼了。

此次拉低心情的有幾點，最詫異的是衞生間居然沒掛捲筒紙，史上從未有過！一衹咖啡杯內壁底部一圈有痕漬，茶壺內壁更甚，衹能直接忽略不再泡茶。馬桶的啟動轟鳴聲從坐上一刻直至起身中間不會停止，自動窗簾按鈕已不靈敏，有時按上毫無反應。Flair的服務生對菜單一問三不知，好在服務主動也就罷了。
希望加強管理，培訓真正熱愛酒店行業的人員。一個品牌酒店，勝在經久不衰。

2. 行政酒廊早餐人可以説是人山人海，非常理解可能盤子碟子不夠用，但飯都沒吃完每一次都着急給我端走了咱也不是特別理解。
3. 環境 配套 都還ok，就這個交通，匪夷所思。哪個城市的哪個高端酒店，從未遇到過如此曲折的出行。

我們去38樓自助餐廳用過年夜飯和早餐：
年夜飯，實話説，不太符合中國人的年夜飯習慣，選一道主菜，自助的東西不多，食材不錯，偏西化，老年人不太適應。
早餐，和之前住的園博園悦榕莊沒法比，就是普通的早餐自助餐，住了4天，沒有變化。倒是行政酒廊的餐食，雖然東西不多，但每天的主菜都不一樣，更有誠意。
泳池水温度不算高，瑜伽房就是健身房裡的一隅，是開放式的。
房間用品使用舒適。
酒店一樓直通德基廣場，由於春節放假期間商場里人山人海，沒敢去。
酒店停車在德基廣場B5，衹有特斯拉、智己還有另一個品牌的充電樁，春節期間車停得滿滿當當的，所以入住期間車也沒充上電，這點有些不便。

缺點：房間面積不大，性價比不高，價格和服務不匹配。
優點：城市景觀不錯，適合情侶，比較適合帶孩子。     中秋佳節本是滿心歡喜，帶着家人孩子來南京。每年你都會來南京遊玩幾天，每次訂不用酒店。這次看排行定的麗思卡爾頓。舟車勞頓晚上10點多才到，帶着2歲半的寶寶，結果辦理入住真的無語，折騰20來分鐘30分鐘，一直站着……本身很疲憊，讓人加倍疲憊。

早餐一如既往的麗思卡爾頓水準：不好吃。幾個城市包括香港麗思的早餐，否不太行。

印象挺好的粵菜餐廳疫情沒開，中餐廳還行。

邁巴赫接送，真的體驗很好。

城中度假，首選麗思卡爾頓。樓下德基購物，應有盡有。
