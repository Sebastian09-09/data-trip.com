msg:Fantastic stay at The WESTIN. We came off-season and it was very quiet however service was on point and the staff super efficient, all restaurants opened and all activities available. The kids club is very clean and great for babies to just stroll around. Butler Revan did everything for us to spend a perfect stay with our 8mo old baby, upgraded us to the most beautiful Ocean view and got us beautiful cars with baby car seat for our car travels. Breakfast have a lot of western/Chinese options, super fresh and variations in the menu everyday so it‚Äôs not boring. The beach is clean, swim/surf possible (nice beach break). Everything is quite new and well maintained, and the staff is very helpful, most of them are English speaking which makes everything easier. Already thinking about our next trip.

msg:For family travel, the Westin Shimei Bay is the first choice for accommodation in Wanning. Environment: In terms of location, the Westin occupies the best location in Shimei Bay. The view of the hotel lobby faces Shimei Island, which is open and refreshing, comparable to the Le M√©ridien next door. Service: In terms of hotel service, all kinds of details are pulled full. According to the housekeeper's preference survey before check-in, because we brought children, we reserved the room next to the children's swimming pool in advance for the convenience of children to swim. Because there are many mosquitoes in summer, mosquito repellent is also plugged in in advance. A group of families passing by, one of the children just had a birthday, and a small cake was also reserved in the refrigerator in advance. Various thoughtful details directly stretched the favorability. Facilities: In terms of hotel hardware facilities and software conditions, in addition to the children's swimming pool and adult swimming pool, there is also an indoor constant temperature swimming pool to ensure that swimming will not be affected by cloudy and rainy days. Transfers to the airport and high-speed rail station can also be arranged, and various parent-child activities are arranged very well, so that children can have a fulfilling life even in the hotel. Hygiene: The room is cleaned, bedding is changed every day, the food is rich and there are many restaurants to choose from. I especially like the hotel's buffet hot pot, which is delicious and fresh. From the comparison of the Marriott in Haikou, the two Sheratons in Sanya Yalong Bay and Haitang Bay, and the two Westins in Wanning Shimei Bay and Lingshui Qingshui Bay, Shimei Bay Westin is the hotel with the best stay experience. Finally, special thanks to Xiao Su from the housekeeping department for her service. She is enthusiastic, attentive, and thoughtful. She can plan itineraries for guests. It is a very satisfactory stay experience. I will recommend friends to come next time!

msg:I chose the latter between Le M√©ridien and Westin because its lobby design is more advanced. I originally booked two nights, but because of the rainy weather, I couldn't take photos. I had to extend it for one more night. It was also a good time for the baby to play in the bubble party in the children's swimming pool. I didn't have time to play in the swimming pool in the first two days. I mainly dug sand and had afternoon tea. The advantage of the beach being so close is that it is more convenient for children to go back to the room to change clothes after getting wet. Because I took the baby on vacation for his birthday, the housekeeper Xiao Wu arranged a small cake. Although it was not big, it tasted very good. The hotel also has a lot of parent-child activities. We participated in two handicraft classes. Before making, the teacher of the Yangyang Club will play an interactive game with the children. It's pretty good. There is also a child care service here. If you want to go for a spa, you can arrange it. After checking out, I went to Lingshui and remembered that the baby's swimsuit and swimming ring were still left on the balcony. Dad's bone conduction headphones were also missing. I contacted the housekeeper Xiao Wu and found everything. Then he helped us to express it directly home. The hotel's pink beach bar is also very good. It also provides children's sand digging tools for free. Adults can relax and free their hands. ü§≠ There are various performances in the lobby at night. We just happened to pass by and went to see it. Very exciting. The children like it very much.

The experience is really good. The room is also designed in a stylish way. The housekeeper Xiao Wu is very considerate. Although there were some minor incidents in the middle, the housekeeper handled them quickly. We are very satisfied and will choose this hotel again when we come to Wanning next time~

msg:Facilities: It was my first time in Wanning and I had a very good impression. I mainly brought my son to play. My son is 5 months old. I liked the swimming pool. There is a 0.4m outdoor swimming pool for children and a 1.4m outdoor swimming pool for adults. There is an indoor 28‚ÑÉ constant temperature swimming pool. There is an exclusive beach.
Hygiene: It is very clean, whether inside or outside the room. Even when I went to the public toilet of the hotel in the middle of the night, the trash cans üóëÔ∏è were all garbage bags of my new love, there were no water stains on the countertops, and the toilet had air conditioning.
Environment: In short, it is high-end. The whole family is very satisfied.
Service: To be honest, I wanted to choose Aimee before, and I was going to see the room before deciding. Aimee‚Äôs security turned us away. It was also according to the rules and regulations. No reservation information was allowed. There was no way. I turned around and went to Westin. I simply checked in the check-in information, and there were three or four drinks to welcome the guests to relieve the heat. The exclusive butler immediately added vx and connected in seconds! I would like to praise our butler sister, Alice, for her very good attitude, instant reply, and answering every question, as detailed as writing an essay. During the stay, we didn't solve any small things, but Alice was enthusiastic and explained them to us in detail. From the basic introduction of the hotel to the sharing of activities, activity reminders, and the surrounding food, clothing, housing and transportation, they were all introduced clearly. The hardness of the mattress, the comfort of staying, etc. can be said to be meticulous. Alice really put the hotel's ideas and services into practice. It's not an exaggeration to say that she treats customers as family! From the time we got off the car, the doorman was handsome and enthusiastic, and all took the initiative to take the luggage with a smile. Then it was delivered directly to the room. The hotel also sent a fruit plate.
Minibar drinks: All free as shown in the picture, and you can refill it once during your stay, which brought countless coolness in the hot Hainan.
Island theme travel photography (including drone aerial photography video, makeup and shooting clothing): organized by the hotel's cooperative unit, record the trip.
Summary: Shimei Bay Westin! The best choice for vacation in Wanning! A good place to bring children! Look for Alice and her hotel team! You will never be disappointed! Look for Westin! The whole family is happy!

Service: I have to praise our butler Mileüëè. He contacted us in advance to help decorate the room before we went there. He also prepared fruits and small cakes. He also helped us contact and make reservations for eating out, taking photos, and going to duty-free shops. He made our experience up. I love youü´∂
On Children's Day, I saw the butler celebrating the birthday of the child at the door of the room with others (dressed as üê∏). So cute‚ò∫Ô∏è

Food: The breakfast variety is very rich, but there are too many people and it is not easy to find a seat; the several restaurants for dinner are also good. Zhiwei's small hot pot buffet is worth it and tastes good, but the taste is more southern and not very spicyüòÇ The element restaurant on the first floor is more expensive, but! It tastes super good! It was more delicious than I expectedüòãIt was also convenient to eat outside the hotel. We walked to eat Fangjie sour noodles in the town (should it be?), but the taste was average compared to what we had in Riyue Bay before, so I don‚Äôt recommend it

Others: The surf shop that the hotel cooperated with was pretty good, and the photos taken were also good; the cooperative travel photography was also okay, and the photos were well editedüòÖ, which made me spend money unexpectedly; the hotel‚Äôs spa was also good, but the price-performance ratio was average

Hygiene: The sanitation was cleaned very thoroughly, and no dead corners were found. When turning the bed, the room lady was serious and responsible, and her hands were very quick. She took out the garbage and made the bed and the floor towels very quickly.

Environment: Westin was the first and most anticipated night in this trip. As soon as you get out of the elevator, the lobby with a height of dozens of meters makes people feel very comfortable. The sea breeze runs through, and you can see the sea standing in the lobby. Although there are a lot of people and it is a bit noisy, the hotel staff is orderly and the check-in is also very fast. The lobby bar is so cozy. I bought an afternoon tea set, collapsed on the sofa, blowing the moist sea breeze, and there were performances by foreign friends.

They were professional and responsible in making travel photography appoin**ents. I said I wanted two bottles of water and they immediately arranged for six or seven bottles to be delivered. Because we arrived early, Alice took the initiative to help us reserve a room that had been cleaned in advance for early check-in.

I have never seen a five-star hotel breakfast like the market for breakfast. There are really too many people, but the products can still be guaranteed. The shuttle boys and girls laid the tableware in time to remind the dining time.
Play: There is an ice and fire show in the lobby bar from 8:30 to 9 o'clock in the evening, and there is an absolutely unique logo ignition ceremony. Travel photography is very good, and all negatives need to be added 399. Drone aerial photography is also very good. The beach lawn is very good, and the pink bar is a bit dead. I didn't experience it. In short, Shimei Bay Westin is really good, and I will come again next time. Thanks to Alice and all the staff!

msg:The details of the room are not at the same level as the hotel. It can be said that it is almost the same as a fast hotel.
The hotel facilities are relatively old. You can smell a strong "mold" smell as soon as you open the room. The carpet under the bed is also visibly dirty.
The light source in the room is relatively old, and the overall light is dim.
There are no smart appliances, and the TV can't even project the screen.
The housekeeper explained that it was raining, but it actually had nothing to do with the weather.
The hotel is still old, and the cabinets in the room are old. With such a good sea view, it really needs to be upgraded! I really don't recommend staying if you really mind.

To be honest, the housekeeper and room service are really nothing to say.
The reason I didn't give one point is because of them.

msg:Last year, I went to the next door Le Meridien. Because of the comparison, I would like to give a special evaluation: a family trip, two adults and one child. Beach: It feels a little more private than Le Meridien. The children feel more comfortable digging sand on the beach, because there are many outsiders setting up stalls to surf at Le Meridien, while Westin only has a surf shop that cooperates with me. I heard that it is a big surf shop. The coaches rotate between domestic and foreign hotels. The price is a little more expensive than Le Meridien, but it feels more professional and systematic. Activities: There are more activities than Le Meridien. Le Meridien‚Äôs free ones didn‚Äôt participate, but you can pay to participate. The free activities here are also very good. We participated in the bubble pool and fishing, although we didn‚Äôt catch a single fish. It is true that big hotels have more activities, because there are several fireworks almost every day during the May Day holiday, but Le Meridien didn‚Äôt have one last year. There are also actors who distribute bread to children in the restaurant in the morning and perform in the lobby from time to time during the day. In the evening, the lawn buffet also performs magic fire breathing and duo singing (the singer from Cuba is very good). After that, there is a performance in the lobby and the mermaid pool until 9:30 in the evening. The children like it very much! The breakfast is also rich! I especially want to give a five-star praise to üåπHousekeeper Xiaonaüåπ! ‚ù§‚ù§üëçüëçShe applied for and gave me a free extra bed for my child, and also provided various activity consultations, restaurant locations, and timely responses, including helping me change pillows and get bath towels, so that our two adults and one child could sleep better and have more fun! ! It's much more comfortable than staying at Le M√©ridien!

The hotel facilities are very complete, including buffet, small shopping mall, indoor swimming pool, lobby bar, coffee and drinks. The most important thing is that there are novel performances every day. The hotel is directly connected to the sea, so you can go for a walk on the beach when you have nothing to do. Choose this hotel for vacation with your eyes closed.

She proactively told me that if the mattress or pillow is too soft, I can ask the waiter to change it to a hard one. She also prepared souvenirs. In short, she is always responsive! 

Especially the service of the staff at the outdoor swimming pool is simply amazing. When swimming, my ears got water and I jumped on the shore to shake the water out. The staff directly sent me a cotton swab! 

Travel photography: 10 photos are given, which is more generous than other hotels. The selection method is different from others. The photographer directly selects on the camera. There is a package price, and you can bargain hard. 
Hygiene: The indoor swimming pool is very clean, and the room is also clean. 
Facilities: The hair dryer in the room is quite old and a little old. 
Environment: The sand on the beach is very fine. The view in front of the sea view room is not blocked and it is quite beautiful. The public area is average and not beautiful enough, but the photos are also good.

msg:Westin Wanning Shimei Bay, I will come again
Since the child was more than 1 year old, he has taken him to travel to all over the world.
I have stayed in many hotels and B&Bs
This time I chose to stay at Shimei Bay Westin for 3 nights and 4 days.
My whole family thinks this is the best service ever
I must thank my lovely little housekeeper, Pang Na
I usually call her Xiaona, even though I have never met her
But I can feel from WeChat that she is a very sincere person
He is almost my "always available and always available" partner.
From parking to arranging activities for your kids
From reception to farewell
Sincerity, love, taking care of everything, this is how I feel about her

In addition, the Shimei Bay Westin is indeed as good as the Wanning family hotel. The service is really good, and even surpasses Xiamen Haiyue Villa in my ranking. Almost all my requests are answered. How many nights? All implemented.
There are a few things that impressed me deeply
1. The weather was hot, so I wanted some ice to drink Coke, and a big bucket was delivered immediately. At the end of February, I went to Chimelong Zhuhai and also asked for ice. My child‚Äôs hand was injured and he needed cold compress. I waited for 20 minutes.
2. The child felt that there was sand and debris in the sheets when he was sleeping. Without saying anything, he even changed the entire bed and quilt for us at 22 o'clock.
3. Parent-child activities are also very popular with children. I originally planned to simply stay in the hotel, but I didn‚Äôt expect that I stayed there for 3 days and didn‚Äôt have much fun. I didn‚Äôt even go to the scenic spots I planned around.

Tell me some shortcomings
1. The lady at the front desk who checked us in on the 22nd was hard to describe and a little impatient.
2. It is best to have less puffs in children‚Äôs puff sleeves, as some will choke the throat.

Others are super satisfied. I don‚Äôt know if I won the lottery with the benefits of Cortana‚Äôs housekeeper. She really brought us a lot of luck.

The experience of staying at Westin this time was super good. It coincided with the May Day holiday. The hotel service management was orderly, the hard and soft furnishings in the room were very new, and the service staff were very friendly. This villa is highly recommended. There is an underground direct parking space, mahjong room, and audio-visual room. The large dining table and sofa area on the first floor are also a good place for gatherings. I would like to make a small suggestion that it would be more interesting if the audio-visual room could be equipped with KTV equipment. There is a dehumidifier in the room, and it doesn't feel damp at the seaside. The hotel has indoor and outdoor swimming pools. The indoor one is national standard, and there are many water toys outdoors. The water quality is very good and the underwater clarity is high. Guests staying in the villa can also enjoy a one-hour tennis court experience, which is very refreshing. The breakfast room is large and the food is rich, and the product quality is good. There are entertainment performances in the lobby bar after dinner, which is very suitable for families with children. Finally, the most important thing is to thank the housekeeper Xiaona for her enthusiastic service. All the activities arranged for the trip and the response to calling a car are very timely. Highly recommend Westin!

I reported the problem to the housekeepers and their leaders and they also gave restaurant vouchers and small gifts, but after returning, my child had rashes all over his body and could not see. I had to write this bad review to let everyone know what this hotel is like.
1. As a five-star hotel, no one took the luggage when I entered the store, no smiles during the whole check-in process, no greeting when I met the waiter on the floor, and when I left, two male employees were chatting and laughing there, and several families were waiting for the car at the door, and no help with the luggage at all.
2. During the stay until 9:30 pm, there was still a large banquet on the lawn, just like a disco, the sound was very loud The room is not big, and the light is very strong.
3. This is why I wrote a bad review. Because my child likes to play in the water, I specially found a hotel with a children's swimming pool. The water in the hotel is very dirty, with dead bugs and leaves in it. There are bubbles every day, but the water is not changed. Once you get to the swimming pool, the bubble smell is very strong. The child can't open his eyes in the water. When the child was in the hotel, his back itched, but I didn't care. I thought it was a mosquito bite. It's also my own fault. After returning, because of allergies, the child's entire body and face have no good spots. The doctor said that it is probably because the amount of disinfectant water used in the swimming pool is too much, which causes problems with the child's skin barrier and large-scale allergies. The child is very uncomfortable and itchy.
I must write this bad review to let parents know what this hotel is like! !

The three-bedroom villa we chose had an underground parking space, direct access to the room, and a mahjong room. The adults were very happy! The environment of Westin is also very good. There are bar beach chairs at both ends of the beach. The hardbar pink theme is also very photogenic! Special thanks to the housekeeper Mile, the service is very considerate and the response is quick, which brings a lot of convenience to our stay! This trip to Wanning is very happy, and I will still choose Westin when I come again in the second half of the year!

He was attentive and attentive throughout the entire process and provided real-time guarantees and services. It was great! If you have any questions, call anytime and we will respond within seconds. Shimei Bay BeachüèñÔ∏è is very fun. There are 10 free travel photos taken by professional photographers. It has blue sea, blue sky, sunny beach, and is very pleasant to enjoy. The hotel has a gym and indoor swimming pool, providing more services. A large part of the hotel's bonus points come from its humanistic care.

The hotel facilities are very adequate. The bathroom is separated from wet and dry areas, and the bathtub is very comfortable to take a bath. There is a small refrigerator and drinks for you to drink. You can hear the waves and birdsong from the small balcony outside. You really face the sea, and the flowers are blooming in spring~

The breakfast is rich and delicious, with a combination of Chinese and Western food.

Some final suggestions:
1-The carpet in the hotel is too old and some parts are mottled and faded. I hope it can be replaced regularly.

2- In addition to the hotel's buffet breakfast, I hope to provide more choices. The price of the Chinese flavor on the first floor is a bit high and the quantity is small. If you want to eat, you can only go to restaurants outside the hotel to fill your stomach.

Checking in at 3-3 o'clock felt a bit late, and I had to wait for a long time at the front desk. Most guests are like this. Since you are here to enjoy it, you must be attracted by it. I hope you can check in earlier next time.

I stayed at Westin Wanning with my bestie during the Qingming Festival. I liked the environment here. The beach was beautiful and there were not many people.
The hotel facilities were good. We enjoyed both the outdoor and indoor swimming pools. It was suitable for lying down without running around. The hotel had enough space and you could enjoy it slowly from morning to night.
It was very photogenic!
I especially like our housekeeper Nana. I will recommend it to my friends.

msg:After looking at Wanning hotels for a long time, I finally chose Westin. Based on my years of travel experience, Westin's pest control work is really good. In terms of the resort hotels I have visited in the country, whether it is the trails outside the hotel or the area within the room, in such a natural environment, it is quite good.
In addition, our housekeeper Mile Fu Tingting can be said to be one of the best housekeepers in my mind after many years of travel. From the communication before checking in to the three-bedroom garden detached room that my leader helped me upgrade to, to any possible communication links, if there are any imperfections in other positions or details, but because Mile puts himself in the shoes of the customer to communicate and deal with the way, customers will feel at ease living here.
Secondly, whether it is the shuttle bus brother or the brother who met on the road wearing a police uniform, the service attitude is very good, and you can feel that he is really answering customers' questions with all his heart.
Finally, the hotel's breakfast is quite rich and is definitely one of the best. It is worth experiencing. The beach of the hotel is really fine and soft. Although the sky was not good when we checked in, the beach, celebrity check-in spots, and lawn are also beautiful places for taking photos and checking in.

It is worth praising that the butler Xinxin reminded and cared for us very meticulously, so that we had a general understanding of the Westin and the surrounding attractions.

The hotel has a lot of parent-child activities. The children had a lot of fun. When it was not hot, it was the children‚Äôs favorite beach digging sand activity, which could be played until nightfall. When checking out, the children strongly requested to stay at the Westin next time. It is worth mentioning that the hotel has a private beach with very fine sand! Wanning is really fun. If there is a chance, I will come again and stay at the Westin to experience the meticulous care of the butler Xinxin!

Thanks to the butler Mile for reminding him in time, this is an entertainment and leisure activity that I have not discovered before reading reviews. There are also ice cream trucks, cake vans, and convenient drinking tables in the lobby. In fact, there must be much fewer people than during the Spring Festival. There is no need to wait for check-in and there is no chance to stay. Therefore, it was not until we were informed that we could go to watch the performance that we realized that the lobby was a place where everyone could have fun together after dinner.

2. Restaurant: The butler introduced us to information such as the hours of several restaurants of different styles. We played and ate outside for lunch and dinner, and only had breakfast. If I have another chance, I would like to try more flavors. The interior colors and lighting of the breakfast room are relatively consistent with the restaurant style of several international chain resort hotels on Indian Ocean islands, especially Westin's own restaurant style. The spacing between tables is also quite good. There are several huge storage shelves or bookshelves with natural partitions, and the outdoor dining tables are also It is very popular among guests. It seems that the sea view is not enough in one day. There are so many kinds of food, you can‚Äôt eat more than one round of the delicacies you want to eat in one morning! There are local specialty noodles and vermicelli, which makes me, who never patronizes noodle stalls, feel satisfied after just three bowls of Western food! All the ingredients of Qingbu Liang are cool, refreshing, sweet and very satisfying. You don‚Äôt need to worry about which one to go to in the market without stepping on the wrong side. Some of my favorite fruits are as shown in the picture. I can‚Äôt get enough of carambola and passion fruit, and there are several types of freshly squeezed juice that I can‚Äôt drink. The low-fat cheese is a specialty, and the fish burger is very popular.

3. Gym: Although I had previewed in advance that this Westin has been built for some years, the fitness equipment is still classic brand equipment, the space is large, and the service is good. I saw several more professional tourists doing resistance training.

There were too many people at breakfast, and the service couldn‚Äôt keep up, forcing me to eat before 8 o‚Äôclock. The Western pastries in the restaurant are not as delicious as those in the lobby bar. 2. The shower equipment is a large bottle. When I visited Sanya and other places at the same time, it was still a small set. I still feel inconvenient when I think of the disgusting videos on the Internet. The hotel slippers are not as good as other Westin hotels I have stayed in. They do not distinguish between left and right feet. They are just Crocs for going out. Not bad, ready to buy a set. 3. Helicopters and powered aircraft are noisy during the day, and the outdoor swimming pool is too shallow.

msg:On this trip to Shimei Bay, I chose the Westin and stayed for two nights. The lobby bar has a good view of the sea view. The view of the room is also very good. The buffet breakfast is more comfortable if you come earlier. The light show in the evening is also interesting, especially if you have children. It's worth coming down to have a look. The housekeeper Xinxin was very enthusiastic and took good care of all needs during the stay. She also met all needs in a timely manner, making travel life more convenient. Thank you very much.

The room facilities are a little older than the Le Meridien next door, but the food is better than Le Meridien. Whether it is breakfast or dinner, the butler Mile's service is very good.

msg:Service: I am most dissatisfied with the front desk. When queuing to check in, the customer in front of me was unable to check in due to hotel cleaning. The lady who checked in at the front desk never solved the customer's needs well. As a result, the customer in front of me kept struggling with the room type, which delayed me for more than 10 minutes in queuing. When it was my turn, I was given a sea view room on a low floor blocked by coconut trees. I was really speechless. Fortunately, Westin assigns a dedicated butler to each customer. When I saw that the room was blocked by coconut trees, I immediately informed the butler Xiaona. She responded very quickly. In less than 10 minutes, I got the new room card and brought it with me. I changed to a sea view room with the best view of Kajing Island on both sides of the lobby. I also brought souvenirs and two breakfasts to express my apology. The service was perfect üíØ When I met the waiter, he would say hello politely. Overall, the service was great. It's pretty good, and then it feels like it's quite suitable to bring children to play. The hotel's facilities and programs are more focused on parent-child activities.
Environment: The environment is good. I saw Blue Tears on the balcony. Unfortunately, it was raining, so I didn‚Äôt go to the beach to take pictures, so I took them in the lobby. The pink sand beach is worth checking out. I almost forgot to mention that there are performances in the lobby every night, which are worth watching.
Facilities: There is a queue for breakfast, which I didn't expect. Maybe there are too many people staying.

msg:A few years ago, I came to Wanning with my friends to stay at the Westin. I also went to Le Meridien and Sheraton for afternoon tea, but I still liked the design style of Westin better. So this time I brought my parents to Wanning and still chose it without hesitation. The Westin.
Let‚Äôs talk about the advantages first: 1. The butler Mile is very professional. During this trip, I took my parents to stay at JW Marriott Sanya, Lingshui Junlan, and Westin Wanning. Every time, the butler would add WeChat to understand the needs in advance, but the Westin Butler Mile is the most professional. After understanding that we would actually have three people staying, he took the initiative to ask the room staff to send a third set of bathrobes and toiletries. However, the first two hotels required me to call the front desk to deliver them. In addition, Mile also We thoughtfully prepared welcome fruits, helped arrange a room with a good view, and reminded us on time to watch the hotel's ice and fire show. Our parents were very satisfiedüëçüèª; 2. The room was very clean, and the response speed of the room service was also very timely. On the balcony Chatting and drinking beer with your family, listening to the sound of the waves, is very comfortable; 3. The lobby is grand and grand, the scenery is still unparalleled, and the beams and columns made of natural stone have the beauty of ancient Greek temple ruins; 4. The breakfast is rich in variety and tastes very good good.

A fly in the oin**ent: I hope the hotel will strengthen beach control. On the one hand, there are many non-resident guests checking in, taking photos, and dancing in the square. On the other hand, there are ATVs running rampant, which are very unsafe. The wheel marks of the vehicles really destroy the beauty, leading to this. This time I obviously felt that the beach was a bit messy, not as private and clean as before, and the feeling of vacation was a little less good.

Check-out was delayed from the original two o'clock to three o'clock because the children participated in activities and games. The butler Mile's service was very good and considerate. He prepared a small cake for the children. She is a very cute girl.
Coming from Atlantis, the facilities are relatively old, and there are traces on the balcony glass that affect the environment at night, but as soon as you enter the room and open the balcony door, you feel like you are on vacation! Feeling relaxed and happy.
Special mention should be made that the parent-child activity only started on the second day. Due to weather conditions, there was only one child on the paddle board. Coach Dahai and Coach Bee gave step-by-step tutorials, which doubled the experience! The kids didn't have enough fun and stayed away.

For an islander living outside the island, Wanning is yyds. Although I booked a garden view room, I can still see part of the sea view. The room is not small. The balcony is also my favorite part. The room is equipped with a dehumidifier. God knows how important this thing is for Hainan back to the south. , I have to pour out a full pot of water every night, and the housekeeper will notify me if there is a performance. When I go to the restaurant to eat, the waiter (Xiao Fan? Sounds like him) is also very good. I can't finish the set meal for one person, and the location of the hotel is also bad. Yes, there are many nearby restaurants and Coffee Dream Factory where you can check in. You can also drive to Nomen Coffee and Nyonya Coffee to check in. All in all, I was very satisfied with the trip alone.

The lobby is spacious and you can look straight at the beach. Welcome to tea.
The hotel also provides travel shots. Unfortunately, there is no time to experience it, but I have seen many people experience classes, and there are free clothing.
There are many types of breakfast. Although there are many people, they are arranged reasonably.

Service: All hotel employees are very polite and will be greeted with a smile wherever they go. On the road to Qianxing Wanning, there is still a twist. Because this is the first time for an energy vehicle, there is no need to explain the elimination of electric power in detail. I contacted the hotel housekeeper. Unexpectedly, after the housekeeper understood the situation, he comforted me and asked me to call the 4S store. After a while of confusion, I finally contacted the owner of the car repair shop and took care of it for me. It was really helpful. Thank you very much. I give the housekeeper a big thumbs up. Compared with Shenzhou Peninsula and Shimei Bay, Shimei Bay does have better hotels, better surrounding facilities, and a better stay experience. It is suitable for people who like to stay in hotels and travelers with dogs. Because I can't bring my dog ‚Äã‚Äãwith me, Shimeiwanpin can stay in Weixin Deng. If I don't want to eat in the hotel, I'll walk a few hundred meters from the door. It's a commercial street with many good restaurants and food supermarkets. If I bring my dog, I can only stay in the garden view hotel. Room, my dog ‚Äã‚Äãand I both like this small courtyard. At noon, the hotel room packed meals for use in the courtyard. Only dog ‚Äã‚Äãowners can understand that they don‚Äôt want my dog ‚Äã‚Äãto stay in the room alone. It can be said that the small courtyard is used It has been fully utilized and my dog ‚Äã‚Äãcan take a bath in the yard. For travel photography, I didn‚Äôt have much confidence in the gift, but the results were so good that I bought many extra pictures myself!
Many tourists are riding the waves, while others are taking photos and checking in. We walked barefoot on the beach. Although the sun was a bit bright, the blue sea, blue sky and gentle sea breeze made us forget everything! Not far away, rose-red parasols, beach chairs and lazy sofas became a beautiful scenery on the beach. So beautiful, Westin!
Thanks to the housekeeper Xiao Wu for the considerate service~

msg:The overall feeling is very good. The butler Xiao Wu is very patient, answers all questions and even gives me a fruit plate.
The hotel lobby was very spacious, with a restaurant and bar, and there was a fire dance show that night, which attracted many people.
The park environment is very good, with swimming pools, gyms, spas, etc.
The luxurious sea view is arranged on the 5th floor, and the view is very broad. The room was big and very clean.
Breakfast is at Zhiwei Restaurant, with a wide range of varieties and good taste. The only drawback is that there was a queue at 9 o'clock when I went.
We also went to a Chinese element restaurant (reviewed separately).

msg:Every Spring Festival, I choose to return to this warm and lively place - the Westin Yishimei Bay. This place has become my tradition: "check-in place", not only because of the familiar New Year flavor, but also the unparalleled environment here. Full of greenery and gentle sea breeze, it is simply an ideal place for vacation and relaxation.
When it comes to eating, the restaurants here always surprise me. Every dish is exquisite in color, flavor and taste. Whether it is authentic Hainanese flavor or international cuisine, you can find it here. The taste is authentic, and every bite is the ultimate pampering of flavor.
In terms of service, the staff are always smiling, warm and considerate. From check-in to check-out, every detail is taken care of. However, during the Spring Festival, there is a heavy flow of people, especially the breakfast, which is occasionally a little chaotic, but overall, the service quality is quite satisfactory.
There will always be a regret in a perfect vacation, that is, the vacation time is not enough. It would be nice to stay longer. When it comes to swimming, the swimming pool design here is quite unique, and the guests will have a better experience. In general, Shimei Bay Chengsi Hotel is a good place for families and UF gatherings, especially during the Spring Festival. The typical fluorine minerals here can enhance the festive a**osphere. The mini bar has free drinks and wine, and a bottle of red wine and a bottle of white wine are provided in the bathtub on the terrace. The a**osphere is full of butler-style attentive service. Xiaozheng was enthusiastic and attentive during the stay. There is a shuttle bus for the whole journey. The breakfast is very rich and varied. Some of Ning's features are basically the hotel has its own beach. The sand is fine and soft. It's very comfortable to lie on the beach and meditate. There was a fireworks show in the lobby bar and a performance in the second night. I have decided to come to Wanning again in the summer, and I still want to stay at the Westin. .

I also tried the hovercraft, off-road vehicles and other projects on the beach.

We lived on the first floor, close to the sea, and it was very convenient to go to the beach. The room configuration was a bit old, and the date on the bath towel was still 20 years old! But I still had a lot of fun, and I‚Äôm also very satisfied with the travel photos I sent! What I am most satisfied with is the butler Xiao Lu. This is my first time to experience butler service in a hotel. The butler Xiao Lu is enthusiastic and thoughtful, and the introduction is very detailed. When we encounter several problems, he helps us solve them as soon as possible. The replies are very timely. Reply in seconds! Because we made a wrong surfing appoin**ent due to his own reasons, Xiao Lu also helped us apply for a late check-out. We are really satisfied, thank you very much!

The portion was quite large, the golden pomfret, beef and vegetables were all very fresh. There was also coconut greens to drink, and the service was attentive. The beautiful woman who took the order seemed to be the restaurant manager. She gave us good suggestions and helped us choose a quiet and spacious seat. We had a very comfortable meal without leaving the house.
The hotel's beach has very fine sand and the children can't get enough of it. It's also very pleasant to enjoy the sea breeze and watch the sea at the beach bar at night.
The room is spacious and hygienic. The only regret is the musty smell. The room is equipped with a dehumidifier, but the smell is still a bit strong.
As a brand under Marriott, the service facilities are very good and the impression is very good. I will choose Westin next time I go to Wanning.

The beach in front of the hotel is the best I have ever experienced after staying at Haitang Bay in Sanya and Qingshui Bay in Lingshui. Because there is a huge lawn in front of the hotel, the room is within easy reach of the beach. The key point is that the beach is flat and long, so children can play in the water and sand without any pressure. What surprised my old mother was that in December, you can see the spectacular sunrise over the sea directly on the beach; the angle of the sunset just illuminates the beach, creating the effect of a mirror in the sky, which is really stunning. The pink bar next to it is also so photogenic, so I washed it down. Finally, I would like to give real-name praise to the little housekeeper Xinxin, who helped us implement our check-in requirements in advance, arranged for us a sea view room with a great view on the 6th floor, and also prepared a baby cot in advance. I really felt at home and I look forward to coming back next time.

When we learned that our hotel date could not catch up with the hotel's scrub DIY event, they helped coordinate and arranged a private experience for us. The service was considerate, thoughtful and enthusiastic üëç

The hotel also has special performances every night. When we checked in, we happened to catch up with the annual Chris**as light-up, which had a strong sense of ritual.


Facilities and environment: The hotel has complete hardware, simple and elegant decoration, and rich parent-child activities. It is right outside the Shimei Bay Beach, with excellent coconut grove and sea water scenery.

Location: Although it is not in the urban area, it is very convenient, with food streets, supermarkets, and pharmacies within walking distance.

All in all a very comfortable family vacation!

msg:The Westin Wanning is the best five-star hotel in Shimei Bay. It has complete overall facilities, a stylish and elegant lobby, excellent room service, a business center, a supermarket and a children's playground, making you feel at home. In particular, there are many restaurants with different flavors, such as Taste, Zhiwei, Chinese Elements, etc. We have dinner at Chinese Elements every day, and the taste is excellent. There are magic and mermaid performances in the lobby every night, which are quite beautiful. 200 meters below the lobby is Shimei Bay Beach. The sand is fine and soft. It doesn't matter if you wear sports shoes on the shore. The sand will not get into your shoes when you walk lightly. When we came, the bay was very windy and the waves were surging. It was very impressive! Opposite is Kajing Island, which is a great place for snorkeling and transparent boat photography when the weather is clear.

I also added WeChat and inquired about some check-in requirements. The arrangements were all in place. I wanted to go to Jiajing Island the next day and recommended it a lot. Good customer service, great experience, the service is really considerate, thank you Mile; and the hotel also has a lot of activities for children, the baby is in the Timberland Players "Sheep Tribe" full-day parent-child activities (pool surfing, water kayaking , Ocean Defense, etc.) I had a great time every day, met many teachers, coaches and good friends, and received many gifts; again, the beach in the hotel is very good, and there is also an Internet celebrity Hardbar, which is very photogenic. I like the Westin very much. Will continue to choose.

The room arrangement had a very good view. The license plate was also entered into the system in advance, so you could enter and exit the hotel during your stay. There is no charge. Every time I send a message to Mile, I get a reply in seconds. This butler service is really convenient. The environment of the hotel is also very good. The Internet celebrity hotel is well-deserved, the photos are also very beautiful, the room environment is clean and the equipment is quite good. The only drawback is that the temperature in Wanning has dropped in the past few days. It is too cold to come here. Wear thicker clothes. We will choose a nice weather next time to stay here.

The housekeeper called me to greet me before I even arrived at the hotel. It was such a coincidence that it was the same person when I checked in. Can I ask if the view room is further away? Of course I chose the viewüòÄThe first impression is that it is big, the lobby is big, and I like the high floors. The hotel has many rooms (more than 400) and is relatively new. The rooms are clean and have sea views. The breakfast is rich, the seats in the lobby bar are comfortable and the sea view is beautiful. There was a small problem with the service, but the hotel paid great attention to solving it. Will come again next time

There is a big lawn in front of the beach, and there is a small lawn in front of the hotel room! Dog walking is everywhere.

I thought the hotel environment would be inconvenient for a long-established hotel, but it turned out that the lobby and hotel are integrated. When you get off the elevator, you will find the lawn + the seaside. It is very convenient! Secondly, due to the weather, there were huge waves at that beach. It seemed like the station next to me would be washed away. I had a lot of fun...

The only drawback is that the hotel does not have an outdoor dining area (such as a beach restaurant), so some people have no place to eat with their dogs and can only go out, take out, or order food to the room~

Anyway, it was very comfortable for one night~
The people in the hotel are also very friendly, and they are also very friendly to June~

Thanks to the butler Xinxin, who arranged a room on a higher floor for us. The sea view is unparalleled. Sitting on the balcony, you can also experience the evening performance in the lobby bar. The small cake sent the next day was amazing. Xinxin made very considerate inquiries during our stay. According to the needs, they also helped to delay the check-out. thank you very much!

The room facilities in the Westin are a bit outdated, but the purifier in the bathroom is very useful and has a clothes drying mode, so the clothes you want will dry quickly. The glass door on the balcony is also very soundproof. After closing, you will not be disturbed by the sound of waves and the warm music in the lobby bar.

The breakfast variety is also very rich. After staying for two nights, the breakfast has changed.

During the three years of the epidemic, I have been planning for the Westin every November, but I have been blocked every time by ü¶†... This year I finally made the trip... I am old and can't stand the ‚úàÔ∏è, so I drove here directly from Chengdu this time
As soon as the order was confirmed, the hotel's GRO contacted us. She was a very enthusiastic girl. Feifei inquired about our needs in detail. After learning that we would bring a dog, she introduced the hotel's pet rules in detail and helped. We made notes and adjusted the room so that the dog could have a more comfortable and convenient space. Feifei sent us all the hotel's facilities and activities in advance. We just arrived at the store, and Feifei was already waiting for us in the lobby... After checking in, Feifei sent us to the room, introduced the facilities in the room in detail, and also gave our dog a cute ID tag... This kind of super Nice butler service, must praise! I am also in the hotel industry... It is not easy for a hotel of this size to provide an ordinary guest with such attentive service. Corporate culture, employee training, loyalty, and the employees' love for their jobs are all missing. No‚Ä¶
You can take your dog to the beach to play. The sand here is very fine...
There are a variety of performances and activities in the hotel, and it also provides travel photography for guests. There are also various beach activities in the evening... adults, children and pets can all find their own homes.
The breakfast is also good, quite rich, and because it was added in a timely manner, there are more drinks and on-site preparations... There is also a children's Lego activity area, allowing parents to relax and have a meal.
It would be nice if the gym could face the sea. I went for a run and the equipment was well maintained... 24-hour credit card access, towels and drinking water are provided. There are not many people... I like it
Just a few steps away from the Westin, there is a commercial area where you can eat. Although it has the aura of an Internet celebrity, it does not affect the taste. It is also an option for those who don‚Äôt want to go far. There is also a very good coffee shop with carefully selected coffee beans and competitive prices in the back. The coffee beans are great...
It's very close to the seaside road, so you need to drive to eat in Xinglong Town, but the food there is well worth it!
I will take my dog ‚Äã‚Äãthere next November...

The hotel is less than 50 meters away from the coastline. You can walk on the beach at any time. This is so happy. When you come to Hainan, you must live by the sea. You can watch the sunrise over the sea and listen to the sound of the waves in your room. I recommend the sea view room here. (4th and 5th floor), the view is unparalleled!
This is the largest Westin resort hotel in the world. As soon as you get off the car, you will be instantly shocked by the hotel lobby facing the sea. It is uniquely designed, tall and wide. Natural sunlight and fresh air flow in this transparent space. The lobby Opposite Kajing Island, a great place to relax!
I like the personal butler Xiao Lu and the hotel manager Zhao who arranged for us in advance the 5th floor sea view room with the best view during check-in. They also sent us various check-in instructions and the hotel's rich activities on WeChat in advance. During our stay Helping guests solve various questions makes us feel that the service here is really attentive, not only of quality, but also of content.
Room number: 5123
Room type: Deluxe sea view twin room, 65 square meters, two 1.4-meter single beds, located on the 5th floor, including self-service double breakfast, the breakfast is excellent, with a wide variety of categories, and the varieties are updated every day. The room has a balcony with a view, and there are coconut trees and the beach outside the window. The room facilities are very complete. The bedding is Westin's exclusive Heavenly Bed, and the toiletries are white tea scented, which is the unified standard of Westin in Hainan.‚Äã
The hotel's private beach has a special pink sand beach and a green lawn with the hotel's logo and coconut trees. It is connected to the sea and sky. It is very photogenic. There are also many sea projects for guests to choose from. There will also be special performances in the hotel lobby in the evening.‚Äã
Each room will be given a set of travel photos, with a choice of 10. However, we were too late this time and did not experience it. We will make up for this regret next time we come to Westin Exclusive, but it is so beautiful here. You can also take many blockbusters with your mobile phone.
In short, coming to Shimei Bay is to relax, enjoy, listen to the sea, watch the sea, ride the waves, and take photos. Everything is unique here. Next time I come to Wanning, I will choose to stay at the Westin without hesitation.

Although I only stayed for one night this time, the hotel's software, hardware and services still left a very good impression on me. I look forward to seeing you again next time I come to Shimei Bay.

Watching the sunset in the afternoon is a must. Secondly, the butler Mile's service is also very thoughtful and warm. Before checking in, They contacted me in advance and asked about all my housing needs~ After checking in, they also gave me desserts and fruits. During the period, I kept asking if there was anything I needed help with. Everything was very comfortable during my stay. Next time I come to Wanning, I will choose Westin~

There are a lot of places to eat nearby. The hotel‚Äôs Elements restaurant is delicious and has a large portion. The coconuts are delicious and I go downstairs to buy one every day.

Will come next time~

The breakfast is rich and different every day, even if it rains, the scenery is still the same! Every day, it beats other hotels. The lobby and lawn are the treasures of the hotel. The restaurant also has many choices for dinner and is of high quality. If there were six stars for service, I would give it six and a half stars. Our housekeeper, Ms. Kuang, contacted us one day in advance and gave us tips on local food, clothing, housing and transportation. Upon arrival, check-in was smooth. It's really sad to encounter a violent couple, but the thoughtful greetings dispelled a lot of bad moods. They made thoughtful arrangements for me before and after check-out. The whole thing is not only professional, but the service can be more appropriately described as in place. I want to be in front of me if I have any questions. Activity They didn't bother us when we were there, and the time they communicated with us was basically during the rest time at night. It matched the hotel's positioning and price, so I gave it six and a half stars. Then the typhoon left Tianjing in the last two days of the holiday. It can be regarded as a journey without regrets. Thank you Westin and Xiao Kuang.

If the weather is good, you can shoot blockbusters without filters in the hotel, which will make you feel refreshed and relaxed.
The hygiene is pretty good, so you can bring your kids here with confidence, but the toilet is a little weak. Because there were children, the hotel also sent extra fruits and cakes, which was very considerate.
The hotel also has a lot of activities. There are performances, art exhibitions, etc. in the evening. The children's pool has bubble baths and they are very fun. The train is also free and the supporting services are very good.

For me, this is a hotel where I can‚Äôt fault anything. Special thanks to the butler Mile. It can be said that I immediately thank you for taking care of you. I will come again.

ÔøºBecause the price is right recently, I deliberately chose a sea view suite. The weather has been very good recently. There is sunshine but not much wind. You can see the sea when you open the window.
I think it's very windy. The decoration of the hotel is also very good, and the quality of the breakfast is also very high. The housekeeper of the hotel I booked through Ctrip contacted me before departure. Therefore, the housekeeper responded very promptly and helped me a lot when it came to checking in and solving some problems. The day before I left, I was injured after surfing at night. I originally wanted to ask the housekeeper if he had any medicine, but he quickly sent me iodine and alcohol. The overall feeling of Bondi is very caring and professional. Ôøº

He is like a little angel on earth. The people are super nice. We arrived late and saw me bringing two children. They gave me free of charge. They upgraded the room type to a poolside room, told us what fun things there were, and gave our two children small dolls. The people were so nice, and the experience of staying here was really great! Give this beautiful lady a big thumbs upüëçThe beach is comfortable, the hotel service is good, and the breakfast is rich. It is suitable for traveling with children. The hotel's children's facilities are okay. You can also go alone and relax, lying on a beach chair by the sea, looking at the beautiful sea, the spring flowers are blooming, and your mood will instantly become beautiful. The hotel room does have a bit of a musty smell, but it's quite acceptable. There are many experience projects in the children's paradise, and some of them should be charged. The Internet celebrity coffee afternoon tea in the hotel lobby is a place where many people must check in. There is a seafood buffet dinner in the evening. There are Chinese food, Western food, barbecue, etc., which are worth experiencing. The hotel is large and luxurious. The rooms are large and there is a moisture absorber for drying clothes. The water temperature of the indoor swimming pool is suitable. Children and adults can play well. The beach is beautiful and suitable for taking pictures. At 5 or 6 p.m., there are swimming pools on the beach. It is also a good parent-child experience for children to catch hermit crabs. There are also triangular wings, beach motorcycles, banana boats, sea surfing and other projects on the beach. There are many choices. Opposite the beach is Kajing Island, which is very suitable for snorkeling. The water is very blue and the sky is very blue. There is a commercial street about 500 meters outside the hotel lobby. It is not too prosperous, but there are restaurants and supermarkets. There is a local village and a fruit market 2 kilometers away from the hotel. The seafood nearby is really delicious and fresh, and the price is also cheap, about 200 yuan per person. You can eat until you can't hold it anymore, 25 yuan a piece. It takes two palms to hold the sea urchin. It is really the largest and cheapest sea urchin I have eaten in Sanya. The hotel also has wellness facilities, but I didn‚Äôt have time to experience them. I took my children to ride a bicycle around the entire hotel. The hotels in Sanya, especially those with private beaches, are really big. If there were no bicycles this time, I definitely would not have the chance to tour the hotel. It's just suitable for staying in the hotel and on vacation. The hotel staff have good service and are very enthusiastic, especially Xiao Wang~ The hotel environment is clean and comfortable, close to the seaside, and it feels great to watch the ebb and flow of the tide. It happened to be raining when we came, and we could spend a day swimming in the hotel. The kids were very happy, which gave the hotel a lot of points. I will choose Westin next time I come to Wanning. I must give a positive review for this stay.

The night view in the lobby is really beautiful. Eat the buffet barbecue on the beach and watch the seaside view. It's very comfortable and romantic to watch the sea breeze. There is a standard swimming pool and paddle boarding, but I haven't played there yet. The hotel's environment and design are fashionable and beautiful. Girls like it so much. To be honest, the room facilities are not as good as outside. Attractive, but also very good. The basic facilities of the room can keep up with the price, but the overall interior design style needs to be new. But I still like Westin very much. The scenery is beautiful, not only the beautiful coastal road, but also the surfing paradise. , and there are 6 kilometers of high-quality beaches. It‚Äôs more than an hour‚Äôs drive from Haikou to Shimei Bay Weiss Resort Hotel. As soon as you enter the hotel, you are attracted by the scenery directly in front. The fully open lobby faces Kajing Island. The coconut trees, the sea, and the island are full of yearning for the island. The rooms at the Westin are better than expected. It's big and the facilities are very new. My favorite thing is of course the balcony. The hotel has many activities suitable for children, such as small trains, powered planes, go-karts, banana boats, etc. Children can‚Äôt stop playing! The hotel is surrounded by the sea on three sides and mountains on one side! There is a large lawn across the lawn. It‚Äôs the beach. The sand is very fine and clean. Walking barefoot on the beach and being beaten by the waves one after another is a great experience. Wanning is a very suitable place for traveling. The sea water of Shimei Bay It's very remote and the sand is clean. The large lawn of Weixinjiang located here extends to the soft white sand beach. You can follow the sea and watch the sea breeze and wait for the sunset to come. Spending the day on the island is nothing more than this. Shi Mei is really It is a treasure land, surrounded by mountains on three sides, so you can enjoy the starry sky and the power of the hotel. There is a large lawn in the hotel, and the sea view connects the sea and the sky. It‚Äôs closer to the sea. As soon as you leave the hotel, you‚Äôll be in the center. There are plenty of activities, including camping, and many village-colored sofas and pink sofas. If you can, you can drink, watch movies, and listen to music. The hotel lobby is very grand, and there are live performances. Wonderful performances by singers and dancers. At night, with lights and sound, it looks like a large bar. You must stay at the Westin when you come to Shimei Bay. The butler Xiao Lu called the hotel in advance to inquire about the surrounding situation.

I can see that Westin is in a better location than Le Meridien. From the beach bonfire BBQ to the pink hard bar, paraglider banana boat to beach motorcycles, the a**osphere of Westin will definitely fill you up! As soon as you arrive at the Westin River, you can pass through the corridor-like lobby before checking in. I saw the blue sea and paraglided across the sea. The hotel is in a first-class location, the beach is very thin, the sea is very blue and beautiful, and it is in an excellent location facing Kajing Island. The facilities are very complete, there are three swimming pools, the indoor swimming pool is 50 meters! It is much larger than the average hotel and you enter the vacation time in a second. Stepping on the sand with your feet and feeling the body temperature of Mother Ocean, you feel extremely happy. Dinner was a BBQ buffet on the beach, with various programs taking turns, and the sunset slowly and gently enveloped this beautiful paradise. Just enjoy this moment!
In addition to impeccable hardware facilities and top-level vacation conditions in China, Westin also arranges a butler for each guest. The attentive service is so kind, okay? . . Our butler Xiaofan was a sweet-talking person and took good care of us. Under Xiaofan's arrangement, we went to Heavenly Spa to get coffee scrubs, and we went to the lawn, seaside and beach to enjoy the food. Travel photography, but we did not participate in other activities suitable for small children! The second night we also saw a bonfire burning, and my father bought ice cream to eat at the lobby bar. At night in the South, the tall plants exude a rich fragrance. Is it Phoenix flower or tuberose? The hotel is close to the sea and has a long coastline. The design style is grand and simple, and the environment is very good. It is a good place to watch the sea and play in the sea. . The service is also very good!

msg:When I stayed at the Westin during National Day, the front desk gave two small gifts to the children when I checked in, which was warm and friendly. The hotel environment is very good, the breakfast is rich, and there are many programs. We met the performance group at breakfast, afternoon tea, and beach barbecue. The children were very happy and took home the balloons made by the magician.
The housekeeper Xinxin added WeChat before check-in, thoughtfully informed the hotel of activities, and even sent cakes. There was a small incident, but it was resolved very actively.
Will stay again next time

msg:After making a hotel reservation, the butler Xiao Kuang contacted us in advance and added WeChat before departure, introducing various hotel services in advance, including how to make reservations for various projects to be experienced near Shimei Bay. She speaks softly and is very gentle~
After taking the airport shuttle bus provided by the hotel, there are welcome fruits and cakes after arriving at the hotel. If you have any questions, you can contact Butler Xiaokuang or the front desk or the guest room at any time. Anyone you can find can help you solve the problem!
Because I didn‚Äôt check the weather forecast when I went out, I found out about the typhoon weather later. Sure enough, it was raining and windy every day. It was a pity that I couldn‚Äôt go out to play in the water or fly. However, the weather was force majeure and there was nothing we could do.
Fortunately, staying in a hotel can solve the problem of eating without going out. Buffet, Hunan cuisine, Chinese food, coconut chicken... there are still many choices, and no matter where you go, the waiters are very good. When it doesn't rain, people rush out to play at the beach. When it rains, they run back. It's quite interesting. After wading in the water, Xiao Kuang even helped to book ginger syrup with the restaurant. Although you can't go out for fun, the hotel has prepared performances at different times. In short, the hotel does its best to provide guests with various services. You will not regret coming to Wanning and staying at the Westin! My only regret is to wait until the weather is nice to go there again!
By the way, the hotel also gave me a souvenir when I left. I took the hotel bus to the duty-free shop and saved a lot. Thumbs up!

msg:The location of the hotel is very good. There is an indoor swimming pool very close to the beach. There is a children's pool on the east and an adult pool on the west. They are a bit far apart, but you can call a battery car to pick them up. The room attendants are very polite! Every time they see it in the corridor, they will greet each other , The attitude of coming to the room to clean up is also very good, really amazing! The room is generally satisfactory, the facilities are quite trendy, the air conditioner is turned on, and it is not cold at all. I called the main station that night, and the manager on duty, Xiaozheng, came to the room immediately. It turned out that it was The balcony door and the air conditioner are linked, and the air conditioner will automatically cut off when the balcony door is opened. In the end, to express my apology, I upgraded the room type and sent fruit, which made me a little embarrassed, so I can feel that the overall service of the hotel is good. The concierge The depar**ent is also very polite. On the first day I arrived at the hotel, I helped the whole process and delivered it to the room. Every time I go back to the hotel, someone will open the door for the lobby. A few more bottles of water will be given away, which is really better than many hotels! A little pitfall is that on the first day, the family that goes together goes to the breakfast room for breakfast (two adults, eleven and a 6-year-old child), The breakfast room charges children for breakfast. I think this is very unreasonable. Finally, I contacted the front desk to help me waive it. I think the hotel should be more humane like the front desk. As a parent-child hotel, it should be more considerate for children. It reflects the superiority of a parent-child hotel Sex, but the activities are well done. There is a special children's activity list, usually 3 activities in the morning and 2 to 3 activities in the afternoon. Customers staying in hotels enter the group to book children's activities for free, and you can also pay for hosting. If you don't want to walk, you can call There is no need to take the children to the lobby with the concierge shuttle bus. Before checking into the hotel, the housekeeper called to ask what to prepare. They said they needed a set of children's accessories. After arriving, in addition to preparing children's products, they also prepared cakes for the children. , the butler Xiao Kuang is really considerate. He will send you all the details of all the bonus items in your house as soon as possible, and tell you how to make an appoin**ent. Westin's butler service is in place, no For example, the butler of Emmy will only reply when you ask yourself, and it is also possible that one butler can‚Äôt handle multiple customer service services, but I personally think that the service content can still be refined! Although there is a beach, but according to the staff‚Äôs introduction, there is an undercurrent in the sea area. It is suitable for swimming, the park is very beautiful, and the garden view has been shot with a lot of Internet celebrities. Overall, it is not bad! I spent a very pleasant holiday here. I ate well and slept well. There are clean and fun children's facilities. There are fine and soft sandy beaches and a magnificent sea. I hope to continue to provide high-quality services and give tourists a high-quality stay experience!

Since the room has not been cleaned, the front desk has pre-processed for us, and the luggage is also kept in a unified way. The lady in the restaurant talked Also very gentle, not long after the front desk called and said that the upgraded room type can be checked in earlier, very pleasantly surprised, it proves that the hotel is always paying attention to the needs of guests, the cleanliness of the room is very pleasant, I personally have a little cleanliness, but the hygiene of the room is very good It is in place, the bathroom has a dehumidifier, and there is no damp feeling like staying at the beach. There are many children's activities inside the hotel. Children can have fun in the hotel from morning to night every day, especially the little brothers who are outdoors and accompany the children. We had a great time, and we especially want to praise the housekeeper, Ms. Xu Lixiang, who contacted us in advance to inquire about the situation and needs, and arranged everything. We contacted the docking person for travel and travel photography. What I am particularly satisfied with is that they are responsive and the response is very fast, which is very important for people who need help when traveling abroad! We renewed our room one day, and when we booked the same room type on the platform, it was already gone. Xiao Xu helped me to renew the original room in advance, which saved us a lot of trouble. The overall facilities of the room are very good. The location of the hotel is in Shimei In the center of the bay, it is very convenient to go to Lingshui, Fenjiezhou Island, Riyue Bay, and many scenic spots from here. The waiters will greet you warmly when they see it. The sound insulation of the room is very good. I can‚Äôt hear the sound of the waves when I close the door, but I still hope that it‚Äôs so comfortable to sleep and hear the waves. Haha, the hotel‚Äôs indoor swimming pool is good, and the supporting facilities are also very good. Choosing to stay at The Westin Shimei Bay Resort is the most correct decision for this trip! It is recommended that those with children can come and play. In the sea view room, you can see the sea by opening the balcony door. There is an open-air children's pool/adult pool on the first floor. It takes less than 5 minutes to walk from the lobby to the beach. Even if you don't want to go to the sea, you can sit on the wicker chair in the lobby Going up to see Jiajing Island in the distance, eating a cold drink while the sea breeze is blowing is also unique. The beach is beautiful, and the photo is taken. The lobby with a glimpse of the beach is also very nice... a proper place for taking pictures and punching cards, from the teacher of travel photography Technical leverage!

When I come to Wanning next year, I will choose Westin again. It is really a very happy experience!

msg:The Westin Shimei Bay is about 20 minutes away from Shenzhou Station by taxi, and the hotel has a shuttle bus for more than 20 yuan to the airport and also to Wanning Station, which is farther away. The train needs to be reserved one day in advance and stayed for five consecutive days. The day I went there was almost The room was not upgraded. After three days, it was upgraded to a sea view room. The layout of the room is pretty good. They are similar, except that one balcony can see the tree and the other can see the sea. Breakfast starts at 6:30 and ends at 10:30. Go out to play in the morning You can have a breakfast. The hotel's courses for children are also very good. I feel that it is more worthy of the parent-child hotel than the activities of Yanlord Crown. The beach is very good and the white sand is very fine. There is a fairy lobby. As soon as you enter the lobby, you are attracted. Open style The design is spacious and comfortable, and you can see the beach from a distance. It‚Äôs so beautiful. After sitting for a while, you‚Äôll be in a good mood. If the service is not lost because of too many people, someone will help deliver luggage or something. It‚Äôs super worth coming, and the activities are very rich. !Their kids club is also really hardworking, so good that you cry.. If the children are happy, don't want it. Children can go surfing, it is very convenient, and Wanning has always been a surfing resort!! It is really exciting and fun, opposite is Jiajing Island, you can go diving, the sea is clear and blue, and you can see all kinds of corals The group is so beautiful, except for the many water sports that adults play, they are all very fun. However, the ultraviolet rays are very strong. The swimming pool where children play in the water is exposed to the sun at 360 degrees, so sun protection must be done well, otherwise it will be a small coal when you come back. This time, I stayed for 5 nights at a time. I tried 2 types of rooms, but unfortunately I didn‚Äôt Experienced the parent-child theme room, and played almost all the hotel activities that I wanted to play. I have to say that Westin did a good job in the sheep and sheep tribe activities. Walking the baby is really good. The teachers are very patient, and there are differences every day It's a fun game, the kids had a great time playing it, and they didn't get tired of it for 5 days , There is a buffet every night on the beach, and there are indoor facilities for children; 3 swimming pools, 1 outdoor pool for children, 1 indoor, and 1 outdoor pool for adults. Westin is currently my favorite hotel after visiting Hainan for the second time. It is comfortable with few people, fine sand and sea blue. It is a one-stop place to take care of the baby. I love it completely (Westin is the hotel near Haimeng in Hainan, , There are also a lot of parent-child projects, you can watch ice and fire shows, play bubble parties, and the super cute little train in the garden, and all the children's supplies are fully prepared in the room, so you don't have to worry about it at all, and the photo hole is really beautiful, The eye of the sky, the morning sun terrace, the forest green environment, the water cube swimming pool, the space impression, the island style, etc., can shoot blockbuster movies anywhere, so the hotel chose this place. There is really no wrong choice. ~. The service is also very good. Get off the bus There are service staff to help with the luggage. All the service staff greeted us with a smile and felt very kind. The housekeeper, Xiao Zheng, contacted us one day in advance to provide us with needs. During the check-in period, there were also various greetings, actively assisting us with any service, and the reply was very timely. This trip was really lucky. In the end, there was an Internet celebrity pink sand bar by the beach. The photos are beautiful. In short, everything is good, and I will choose this place again in the future!

msg:The Westin Resort Hotel in Shimei Bay, Wanning, I stayed at this time was beyond my imagination. First of all, before I checked into the hotel, they arranged for me a butler named Xu, who confirmed the check-in information with me in advance. Asked what my needs were, I said that the two rooms I requested should be next to each other, and it would be best to arrange a room with a better view. After I checked into the room, I found that the view was super beautiful. I am very grateful to Butler Xiao Xu for his careful arrangement. Although we only stayed for one day due to time constraints, housekeeper Xiao Xu was very considerate in introducing us to the surrounding attractions and special snacks.
Since my husband needed to smoke, there was no one in the room. After informing Xiao Xu, the service staff immediately sent us an ashtray. Once again, I would like to praise Butler Xiao Xu! !
The scenery of the Westin Hotel is beautiful. Although the facilities are a bit old, they are clean and tidy. The service staff are warm and considerate. Although we only stayed for a short day, these all left a deep impression on us! I believe I will come again! !
Thank you again, Butler Xiao Xu, for your considerate service! ! !

msg:Play along the way and pass by Yuzhizhou Island in Haitang Bay, Qingshui Bay, Monkey Island + Daidai Island, Boundary Island, and finally Wanning. Each of these places has its advantages and disadvantages, but Wanning's pace is slower. It is suitable for friends of all ages who like to travel slowly and savor the moment. Our family finally chose the Westin Resort Hotel in Shimei Bay. A good friend recommended it, and I also made a strategy. As expected, the kid was very happy. We arranged activities for him every afternoon, and even learned how to surf. We soaked in the swimming pool every day, or went to the beach to catch the sea around Hainan Island. The hotel we went to was originally entangled between Westin and Le M√©ridien. Catch crabs with my family on the beach of the hotel at night. I really like this activity. There are often activities on the beach at night. It is connected to the beach of Le Meridien next to it. The evening scenery is superb, and the receptionist Xiaozheng is also super nice. The room has a large interior space, complete facilities, clean and hygienic, and welcome fruit. If the weather is good, you can see the sunrise early. The room facilities may be at the seaside, and the room is equipped with a dehumidifier. Parking is very convenient. The large parking lot is suitable for self-driving travel. The check-in experience is amazing, with a private beach. Sisters who want to shoot big movies can also find a photographer in the hotel. Teach you how to pose, the location of the scene is very good - and the film is very good. The hotel has its own heated swimming pool, which is super convenient. Two days before the trip, Xiao Xu, the housekeeper at the front desk, called to inquire about the check-in information, and added WeChat to provide full service from before check-in to after check-out. The private butler responded in a timely manner, polite and thoughtful , all problems can be solved, and all the hotel-related facilities and restaurant menus are sent to me, so that I can choose in advance. It takes about 1.5 hours to drive from Sanya Airport to the hotel. It is very good to book an online car-hailing service in advance and rent a car yourself. Facilities: Booked a parent-child room with a big bed and a small tent. We live in just the right size, with a good size and a large space for washing. The cleaning is timely, and the attitude of the waiters is very good. They are polite and greet each other. Whether it is the front desk, the concierge or the room service, the attitude is very good. Serious and responsible, warm and polite. I will call to ask about your preferences and needs before checking in, which is very good. See how many people give us mineral water. The hotel has complete facilities and many restaurants. I ate them all this time. The taste is good. The beach is clean. You can make appoin**ents for various water sports. Jiajing Island opposite is worth a visit. It‚Äôs very beautiful. All the hotel staff I met in the hotel were very polite and answered every question. It seemed that they had undergone professional training and felt at home. Parent-child activities are very rich, suitable for walking children. Parent-child and adult free activities must be reserved in advance. Make an appoin**ent the night before for the next morning's activity, and make an appoin**ent for the afternoon at 12 noon on the same day. If you are interested, it is best to make an appoin**ent in advance, otherwise there will be no places left. The beach is also very close to the hotel, and the sand is very fine. I asked the front desk to borrow a sand digging tool, and I actually gave a brand new set. The children's pool here is open from 9:00 to 6:00 every day. What impressed me the most is that the hotel's service is superb. I personally think that the service is more important than anything else when staying in a hotel. The sanitary conditions and facilities are not much different from luxury hotels. In the end, satisfaction is nothing more than It is service. The needs of customers can be quickly and accurately resolved. This is what Westin has achieved. This experience is unforgettable, and I will always recommend it to my friends who want to come to Wanning.

There are too many people in Sanya, Hainan, so I chose Wanning Wanning Le Meridien and Westin. After choosing for a long time, I finally booked Westin. After I arrived, I realized that I really chose the right hotel. There is a free bus from Sanya Airport so you don‚Äôt have to worry about traffic. One day before departure, the front desk of the hotel will call you and add WeChat. They will tell you about the travel strategy. The information on the hotel‚Äôs exclusive parent-child activity group is not new. There are different activities for adults and children at each time period every day. When you go out of the hotel with your hands free, the beach sand is super soft. Wearing a swimsuit in the room, you can go straight to the pink beach bar on the beach. You can take pictures for free. The location of the hotel is also very good. It is very close to Phoenix Bookstore and Guanhai Pavilion Caring. Everything that can be considered for you is considered. It is great to respond to your needs. I feel that I have not played enough. I will continue to choose the Westin Hotel next time. The overall evaluation of the hotel is a very beautiful hotel. You can feel the beauty of the hotel from the moment you enter the lobby , and entering the Westin lobby can give you a feeling of customer first, the passing waiters will take the initiative to greet you, and they will provide you with the best service when you have any needs. The hotel has a supporting playground and water Paradise, you can play in a down-to-earth way when you stay here. The most comforting thing is that the child knocked on his leg while running and playing. The staff in the playground told us to wait a while and quickly brought disinfection supplies I made a simple bandage for the child, which is really heart-warming, and the food in this hotel is also delicious. I heard that customers from the hotel next door come to the Chinese restaurant here for dinner hahahaha, but the Chinese restaurant here The whistle noodles are really delicious, and it is definitely my first choice to come to Wanning Westin in the future

I came during the National Day holiday, and the housekeeper "Classmate Xiao Xu" deserves special praise.

If there is any problem in the middle, I will reply immediately. This is much better than Ai.
Breakfast is also very rich. There is also a pink bar on the beach, which is great for taking photos. The only drawback is that the cameraman is mediocre, and the service and level are inferior compared to other hotels.
Special praise is given to "Classmate Xiao Xu" for his sincere and meticulous work.

The indoor swimming pool is 50 meters long, so you can swim casually when there are few people. Great breakfast. The room temperature is just right and cold friendly.
Surroundings: After surfing at Fenghuang Shili Bookstore in the morning, the road was closed for the bicycle race, so I added Jingdao Float for 200 yuan, which is the best value spent in Hainan for 250 yuan.
The service of the butler Mile was very good, and other staff answered all my questions. There was no uncomfortable place in the hotel. I went diving for the National Day holiday. There were so many fish and corals. It cost 50 yuan to take an ATV back to the hotel. I had the most perfect time in Hainan. The ending.

Facilities: The hotel's hardware facilities are very good. There are two swimming pools, one indoor standard pool and one outdoor. The water quality is very good and there are not many people. The lobby of the hotel is really grand. You can see Jiajing Island at a glance. The location is excellent and the outdoor green plant design is also very comfortable. The gym is big enough and has a complete set of equipment. A group of us go there every day to exercise.
Service: The housekeeper contacted me before I checked in. If I had any questions from check-in to check-out, the housekeeper would provide timely help and feedback. The service attitude was very good. On the third night of my stay, I didn't sleep well because frogs were croaking in the pond all night long. The housekeeper and the housekeeping manager even called me to apologize. I can't say enough about how good my attitude was.
Let‚Äôs talk about food here! ! ! I originally thought that Westin's buffet would be fine. I ate all three meals a day. The morning buffet was of no avail, it was just okay. The dinner seafood buffet was really disappointing! ! ! There is no seafood, the venison and mutton are not fresh, the styles of other dishes are pitiful, and the taste is very average. It cannot match the standard of a five-star hotel at all. It is really bad. It has been seven years since it opened. Has it always been at this level? üôÑ
I went to the Taste Restaurant to order at noon. Since I wasn‚Äôt too hungry, I ordered a bowl of fried noodles. I was amazed. It was very authentic. I asked the chef later and found out he was from Shaanxi. No wonder it was delicious. Because the Mid-Autumn Festival is coming soon, the restaurant also sent a dish and two homemade mooncakes. I was very touched and very happy. üëçüèªüëçüèª
Finally, I would like to mention that the hotel‚Äôs coffee in the buffet restaurant, coffee in the lobby bar and afternoon tea snacks are all very average! ! ! I hope the catering depar**ent can really improve the quality of food production.

Especially Xiaona, the hotel housekeeper, communicated with me one day in advance to confirm, and arranged fruit and baby supplies in the room. The whole process was very considerate. After staying for five nights, she basically communicated with us every day to see if there is anything that needs help! Thank you very much Xiaona for your thoughtfulness, next time I come again, I will contact the housekeeper Xiaona!

The service is very warm and the butler Xiao Xu is warm and thoughtful. Thank you very muchüòÄ
The pink beach is very popular, and the beach buffet in the evening has a great a**osphere, with foreign singers and some performances.
The hotel facilities are indeed a bit old, but overall they are OK.
Parking is free, unlimited entry and exit, and breakfast is rich in variety, but you have to wait for a table during peak hours.

msg:Around the island of Hainan, from Haikou to Qionghai, to Wanning, to Sanya Haitang Bay, Sanya Yalong Bay, to Yazhou, stayed in 5 hotels. The sea view seen at Westin Shimei Bay is the most beautiful, and the breakfast is also the best and richest. Both Sanya and Wanning are popular tourist cities. There are many five-star hotels. Each hotel has its own focus. There are many guides and reviews on the Internet to tell you how to choose a hotel. In fact, many experiences are personalized, and it is impossible to choose a hotel. You will not be confused if you choose a hotel that has everything you need and is the first in everything. Do you value the scenery, parent-child experience, surrounding facilities, hotel services, cost-effectiveness, etc. The hotel is located in Shimeiwan Resort, Wanning, with a superior location. You can see the sea when you open the sliding door in the room, which is great! Room facilities: I had communicated with the housekeeper Xiaozheng in advance and wanted a room with a better seat. The room given by the hotel with the elderly and children was very good. It was very comfortable and quiet. You can see the plus on the opposite side even if you sit in the room without pushing the door. Well Island! I added WeChat before check-in, saying that I was not feeling well recently, and the room helped put a few more bottles of water. After entering the room, the bar was full of more than 100 bottles of water. It can be seen from the details that they attach great importance to customers' requirements and are not stingy at all, which is great. Cost-effectiveness: The kids club is also very good. After staying for four nights, one day the children were taken care of, because there were no other children that day, and it turned out to be one-on-one. The children had a great time! Their children's club also has a lot of activities every day, and children like it very much. The children are very happy and satisfied and don't want to leave, and want to come again later. The children's activities arranged by the hotel every day are very rich and high-quality, and the teachers are very patient. It is very recommended for families with children on vacation. I think the activity is suitable for ages, 4-12 years old. If you choose this hotel with children, it is very cost-effective! Children like the beach here (it is very close to the hotel). Compared with Haitang Bay and Coral Bay, the sand here is very fine and comfortable to walk on. Children like to run in the waves. The Westin in Shimei Bay is perfect for lying flat! The sea here is very beautiful, because the beach is provided by the hotel, so it will not be very noisy. The room is very big and clean after a few steps out of the room. The location and transportation: there is a food court opposite the gate, and there are several restaurants inside Home restaurant: The coconut chicken and the vinegar hot pot are both good. It is only 10 minutes away from Riyue Bay. It is very convenient to get there in ten minutes by taxi from the high-speed rail! The overall layout of the house is very good, with dry and wet separation, and it is all frosted glass. Going to the bathroom, bathing and washing can all be carried out at the same time without interfering with each other. There are also two doors, which are very convenient and practical, and there is a lot of space. In the evening, there will be resident singers, performances, and a good experience! Order a cup of Cosmopolitan and listen to music with friends, the feeling of vacation comes leisurely! Parking: just register the license plate at the front desk, it is very convenient to enter and exit! Sound insulation: good effect Breakfast: delicious and rich! I saw a lot of comments on the Internet saying that Westin‚Äôs service is not as good as that of Le M√©ridien. I have been struggling to choose between Westin and Le M√©ridien. In the end, I still want to experience Westin. But after experiencing it personally, I felt the luxury and Comfort, front desk, concierge, room. The enthusiastic service of the recreational staff, there will be resident singers and performances at night, and the experience is good! Order a cup of Cosmopolitan and listen to music with friends, the feeling of vacation comes leisurely! I will book this hotel next time I come to play!

There will be drinks in the lobby in the afternoon, and the breakfast is also very rich. The service is meticulous. The room was cleaned promptly. The service staff you meet will also say hello in a friendly manner. Especially Xiaozheng in the front hall when I checked in. After assisting us to check in, he explained to us the distribution of the hotel's facilities very carefully. Introduces the specific activities of the hotel during the stay. It left a very good impression on our trip to Wanning from the beginning of the hotel check-in. It is very suitable for lying flat. The pet-friendly hotel is really great! Friendly reminder that dogs can only stay in the room and the beach area, and they cannot enter the restaurant. What is happier than being at the beach? Of course it is playing with the dog on the beach.
The variety of breakfast is quite rich. There are too many guests in the morning, so they have to queue up. If I go downstairs after 10 o'clock, it will be almost lunch time after I finish eating.
The indoor swimming pool is 50m long, and it is very refreshing to swim. I stopped a few swim lanes
Hotel catering is online as a whole
Tianmeng Spa is great. When I came to Shimei Bay to play, I happened to see the Westin Hotel, so I came to drink afternoon tea and play by the beach. The service is very good. The waiters are very warm and thoughtful. The environment is very good. The lighting in the lobby is well adjusted, and you can directly see the beach from the beach. The hotel can go directly to the beach and there is a beach bar where you can lie down and rest, and there are many entertainment items that are very suitable for the whole family to play. Some people said that Westin is not as good as Le M√©ridien in terms of hardware and service. Fortunately, it was strong and did not check out. The final proof Sailors are really scary. Westin is much better than Ai. The most important thing is the butler service. The butler Xiao Zhang has been solving many problems for me during my stay at the hotel. When I check in, the front desk will ask if I want to drive. Guests are free from parking, and the license plate must be reported. There is no parking fee for hotel guests. Again, the hardware facilities are relatively complete, and the breakfast is relatively rich. Finally, the beach is really good, and there are really many people at this time of our visit, but it does not affect the experience. I am happy. , When you arrive at the hotel entrance, the waiter will take the initiative to serve you and lead you to the front desk for check-in information. There is free tea in the lobby. Room facilities:
The room is clean and tidy, with all the usual configurations. Children‚Äôs toiletries, slippers and bathrobes are provided when you bring your children. Wi-Fi: Free of charge. There are quite a lot of activities in the children‚Äôs pool. In the afternoon, there is a bubble machine, free hand rings, and bath towels. . It was the birthday of our little friend when we checked in. The hotel provided a small cake for free, with the words [Happy Birthday] at the end of the bed. There are also free sand-digging toys on the beach, and the drink in the small refrigerator is free once when you check in.
Overall experience is really great

I didn't book them last time and this time I got my wish. Geography The location is quite convenient to go anywhere. It is recommended to rent a car and drive by yourself. Every scenic spot is far away from each other. However, the price of food around here is half as expensive as that of Shenzhou Bandao.
Parking: My friend rented 3 G18s with his family. It is convenient to park. The parking lot is very large, and there is no need to pay for the registration of the license plate in advance.
wifi: It‚Äôs really not good... The signal at the seaside is not very good. I count on wifi, but I don‚Äôt know that this wifi is better than 5G

There are not too many people for breakfast before 8:30. After this point, you will need to queue
Cost performance: It's still very good... It's better to stay at the Westin if you live in the Shenzhou Peninsula... The service facilities and breakfast are very good, and it's worth the price. There are two decent hotels in Wanning, but Westin is my favorite. Most of the hotels are very elegant. The advantage of Westin is that it is very convenient to go to the beach, and there is a big beach on the beach directly opposite the hotel at night. The water in the area only passes through the calves, and the sand is very fine. The indoor swimming pool that is very friendly to stepping on the water at night is also very good. There is a roof on it, and the side can also be opened for ventilation. It is very close to the children's bubble pool next to it. In the evening, there are performances in the lobby bar of the hotel, which are very exciting. It is very relaxing to drink something to watch the performances and listen to the songs. Or every design of Sting is good, the price and taste I advise everyone to eat the food in the hotel, it is really good, just look at the other bad reviews, and there is butler service. Before check-in, the housekeeper Xiaozheng contacted in advance, and the room was also decorated. On the day of check-in, I also gave us a gift of fruit and small cakes. Very nice!

msg:If you go to Wanning for vacation, it is right to choose Westin.
In the winter of 2021, I came to Wanning alone. When I went to China Resources Jiuli Phoenix Bookstore, I stepped on the beach of Shimei Bay, and I made up my mind to bring my family with me. In Guanhai Pavilion, you can see that the location of Westin is better than that of Le M√©ridien. From beach bonfire BBQ to pink hard bar, paragliding banana boat to beach motorcycle, Serena Williams will definitely fill you up with fireworks!

As soon as you arrive at the Westin, you can see the blue sea through the corridor-like lobby before you check in. You can paraglider across the sea and enter the vacation time in a second.
In the afternoon, Bao'er and I couldn't wait to go to the beach to fly a drone, and went to the spa to make a coffee scrub, and then went to the outdoor pool with my dad to swimüèäüèªüèä; it was too hot, and I couldn't go to the beach until five o'clock wave. Serena's sea and beach can be called the ceiling of domestic beaches. The sand is white and fine, the sea is blue and clear, and the waves roll up layer upon layer of snow; a family of three just walks on the beach, and their feet feel as if they are stepping on the sand. The body temperature of Mother Sea makes me feel extremely happy.
Dinner was a BBQ buffet on the beach, with various programs taking turns, and the sunset slowly and gently enveloped this beautiful paradise. Just enjoy this moment!

In addition to the impeccable hardware facilities and domestic ceiling-level vacation conditions, Serena also arranged a butler for each guest, and the considerate service is too nice, okay? . . Our butler, Xiao Kuang, is beautiful and sweet-mouthed, and takes good care of us. He is crazy and heartfelt ‚ù§Ô∏è.

Also under the arrangement of Xiao Kuang, we went to Tianmeng Spa to make coffee scrub, and went to the lawn, seaside and beach üèñ with our baby to enjoy travel photography, but we did not participate in other activities suitable for children!

On the second night, I saw a bonfire burning. Dad bought ice cream and ate it at the lobby bar. At night in the southern country, the tall plants üåµ reveal a strong aroma, is it the phoenix flower or the tuberose?
Perhaps, smell is also a souvenir of travel.

msg:I chose Westin in Wanning a long time in advance. At the time, I fell in love with Westin at Le Meridien Westin. After checking in, I felt that it really lived up to my expectations. The hotel facilities and service were very good. Room facilities: We stayed in a room with a small courtyard on the first floor. Although we couldn‚Äôt see the sea view from the room, it was very close to the breakfast room on the first floor. We went out from the first floor and walked to the delicious chicken outside the mall. , or the beach is very convenient, but the room is not tidal. Breakfast: The restaurant is very large, and the breakfast ends at 10.30. Because the store is large, you still have to queue for a while during peak hours. A certain product is very rich, and there are adjus**ents every day. The noodles are very delicious. You can see the beach outside. Although it is not hot in July during the official holiday, it is better to sit outside in the wind
Swimming pool: Compared with the special parent-child hotel we stayed in before, the swimming pool is not unique. We searched around the children's swimming pool in Baowai, but we couldn't find a swimming pool for adults. There are poolside rooms, but the hotel has too many activities. So we never ran to the swimming pool kids club: the activities are also very rich. "Look at the picture is suitable for liberating adults. Beach: After 5:00 pm, the beach is crowded with people. After all, there are too many people in the hotel, and there may be many non-resident tourists. Play, because Shimei Bay is facing south, so you can't see the sunset. It‚Äôs really good to take pictures in the sand. After the number of tourists is gone, listen to the sound of the sea and watch the sea. It‚Äôs a day of scenery. There is a limited shop in the sand. Let me know. Xiaogui‚Äôs small-term friendship below 125 requires a one-for-one private price of 38, but compared to the 20,000 surfers who are crowded with surfers, the sea here is still much empty.
Lobby Bar: There will be performances in the lobby on the second floor after 8:00 every night, or there will be resident singers or ice and fire shows, magic shows and dance shows. Children like it very much. There is also a small train in the hotel for 50 yuan, which is a small carousel train. Westin is a hotel close to Haige in Hainan, so surfing is very convenient, and Wanning has always been a surfing spot!! It‚Äôs really exciting and fun. 2 people Opposite is Jiajing Island, you can go diving, the sea is clear and blue, and you can also see various coral groups, which is so beautiful. 30 In addition to many water sports for adults, there are also many parent-child activities, playing bubble parties, and I love the little train in the park, and all the children's supplies are prepared in the room, so you don't have to worry about it at all, and the photoshoot is really beautiful, the eye of the sky, the morning terrace, the forest green environment, the water cube swimming pool, the space impression, and the island style Wait, you can shoot blockbuster movies anywhere. The swimming pool room on the first floor is absolutely top-notch for babies. The swimming pool at the entrance is only as deep as adults‚Äô knees, so children who are afraid of water can play with confidence. The younger ones are addicted to playing hand boats, bubbles, and balls, and the older ones have slides to play on. The Westin letters on the beach and the pink bar area are good places to take pictures and check in. There are also slippers, toiletries, and toilet brackets for the children in the room.

The decoration is high-end and self-cultivated! Tall, good service, high cost performance, good sanitation, good environment, complete facilities, especially the housekeeper Xiao Feng, who is very warm and thoughtful, answering every question!

msg:I like this hotel very much. The lobby has a good view and you can see the invincible sea view. But what I like the most is the service. Compared with Amy next door, the service is really caring. The housekeeper, Xiaozheng, contacted me via WeChat one day in advance. We booked a stay with friends, and the housekeeper Xiaozheng informed us one day in advance that he would upgrade us to a sea view room for free, and also helped upgrade my friend to a sea view room. Told us about many activities to choose from. We wet our clothes playing at the beach. Although the room was not cleaned, we gave the option of taking a shower first in the spare temporary room. Although we didn't use it later, we still felt that it was proactive in solving problems for guests, which is worthy of praise. We also met Xiao Zheng to say hello and thank him in person for his warm service. Well, he is a very handsome butler. I have been choosing between Le Meridien and Westin, and I have stayed in the last two hotels. Overall, Westin's butler service should be very good, giving people a very comfortable and friendly feeling. The Westin lobby is very a**ospheric, the bed is very soft, and I slept soundly all night. In addition, I did not delay the check-out. My friend asked if it could be delayed, and replied with a note, and then it was delayed until 14:00 in the afternoon. Although we didn't have a late check-out in the end, it felt good to be able to accept the agreement. Westin has a shuttle bus to pick up and drop off at Wanning High-speed Railway Station. The car is at the bus stop obliquely in front of the Wanning high-speed rail exit, and there is no need to cross the road, which is very convenient. If you go to Sanya Airport and duty-free shops, there are shuttle buses, which are very user-friendly and convenient. After we stay at Le M√©ridien later, we go back to the Westin and take the shuttle bus to Wanning Station, because I think the hotel has a full-time driver. It will be very safe. The attitude of the staff in the spa and the front desk is very gentle, soft-spoken, and considerate of the guests, which deserves praise. Generally speaking, the facilities are good. The hotel has many free and paid children's activities to choose from, which is friendly for those with children. The hotel is divided into east and west areas, it is long, and it is still a bit far to walk. But there is a sightseeing bus, so it is very convenient to go back and forth! This basically meets the standards of a five-star hotel; the environment is beautiful, and the sunrise is also beautiful. It would be better if there are more lounge chairs on the beach; opposite is Jiajing Island, which is very convenient for going to the sea. I saw many sheep and sheep tribes who rated the hotel well. Next time Come try the hotel's child care service, 599 yuan per person, you can take care of the beast for a day, it feels super value. Although there was a little hiccup at the beginning and the room was not given to us in time, the hotel handled it very proactively and the housekeeper Xiao Zheng also followed up. Overall it was very good and I liked it very much!

The beach of the hotel is very beautiful. It is next door to Le M√©ridien. They share a beach. There are many rooms and complete facilities. There are also many activities for children, and the free travel photos are also good.
It's a pity that I only stayed for two days, and I will come again if I have the opportunity.

msg:There are many hotels in Wanning, but few good ones. Le Meridien, Westin and Sheraton in Shenzhou Peninsula, but Westin is the hotel I fell in love with at first sight. After checking in, it really lived up to expectations. From the hotel facilities The environment and service make me feel great. We stayed in a room with a balcony and a bathtub on the 5th floor. Standing on the balcony of the room, you can see the sea view. It is very close to the breakfast room. It is also very convenient to walk from the first floor to the outside of the shopping mall. It is very convenient to go to the beach. The room is equipped with a dehumidifier, so it is not damp. You can also see the sea view outside for breakfast, surrounded by the sea, which is very good. Therefore, it is recommended to sit outside and have breakfast with a better view. Compared with the special parent-child hotel I stayed in before, Many children's activities in the hotel are still very distinctive. There are bubble activities in the outdoor children's pool. The hotel's activities are very rich. Because Shimei Bay faces south, you can test the sunset and sunrise. It‚Äôs very easy to take pictures, and it‚Äôs very easy to make a film. Walking on the beach, listening to the sound of the sea blowing the sea breeze, and the endless sea view, I want to open a bar on the beach. There are many people surfing here on the beach of the hotel, and they are all learning Basic courses, so surfing is very convenient, and Wanning is a surfing resort, it is really exciting and fun, opposite is Jiajing Island, you can go diving, the sea is clear and blue, and you can see various coral groups, very Beautiful, except for the many water sports for adults, the waves here are very suitable for learning. The sea here is still very empty. Every night after 8:00, there will be performances in the lobby on the second floor, or there will be singers singing or ice and fire shows. , Children like the magic show and dance show very much. The children's train in the hotel is also very distinctive. It is a carousel train. There are also many parent-child programs, bubble parties, and a super-loving garden train. All the children's supplies are fully prepared in the room. Don‚Äôt worry, and the heart of taking pictures is really beautiful. The eye of the sky, the morning sun terrace, the forest green environment, the water cube swimming pool, the space impression, the island style, etc., can take large pictures anywhere. The swimming pool at the entrance is only as deep as an adult‚Äôs knee. Children who are afraid of water can play with confidence. The older ones also have slides to play on. Also, the pink bar area is a good place to take pictures and check in. It is also a check-in spot for Internet celebrities. There are slippers, toiletries, and toilet brackets for children in the room. It is very considerate. There is a safe and a small freezer in the room. Five or six kinds of drinks are provided. There are two kinds of coffee and two kinds of tea. The overall cost performance is high, and the service is also very good, especially the butler Xiaozheng, who is very warm and thoughtful, asks about his health and care, and feels at home!

I stayed for 3 nights in total and I was very happy every day. Now that I‚Äôm back home, I feel so energetic. Wanning is really great.
The hotel's gym is the best among all domestic five-star hotels I've been to.
Had a buffet dinner, the barbecue and vinegar were very good.
Going to the gym once a day takes the family to the extreme.
I go to have breakfast on time at 7 o'clock every day. The flow of people is small and the experience is great. If you are late, you have to queue up.
The shuttle bus from Wanning to the hotel was very prompt.
Finally, we were upgraded to a sea view room for three nights, which was a great experience.

1. Location: Located in Shimei Bay, there is an airport shuttle bus to the hotel with different time periods, which is very convenient

2. Hotel hardware: A relatively new hotel, it is said to be the largest Westin in Asia. The decoration style and design are very conceptual and leisurely and resort-style, especially the lobby is transparent from north to south and has an excellent view. You can look out from the lobby bar. On the opposite side of Jiajing Island, Juejuezi

3. Butler service: The hotel has an excellent management system and service process. The concierge manager Mr. Su Mingwen and the butler Xiao Xu contacted me early.

It is very worthy of recognition and full of praise. Bonus pointsüòä

4. Room facilities: The overall layout of the hotel rooms is well-proportioned, with dry and wet separations. It has its own bathtub and a thoughtful 40-degree reminder.

msg:The Westin Wanning is simply the first choice for vacation! This time I went to stay in three hotels with my friends, Edison, Kangtai House, and Westin. Westin is our two favorite hotels. There are camping bases, surf clubs, and motorboats by the sea. Various recreational facilities, hotel service attitude is very good, the reasons for recommendation are as follows: First, the location of the hotel is very good. Adjacent to Sanya, the transportation is convenient, sitting on a private beach, clean and few people, and there is no feeling of eating dumplings during the summer vacation! Second, the service of the hotel is very good. From the housekeeper Xiaozheng‚Äôs pre-installation of electricity, caring greetings, warmly arranged children‚Äôs products in the room, welcome fruit plate, relaxing white wine... warm and thoughtful service, more like a child in our own family, let us feel his love Kind and sincere. From him, you can feel the very good management level of the hotel. It is worthy of the standard service of a five-star hotel! The third is that the hotel's package is super value. The lobby is really big and beautiful. The two kids are running around and like it very much. In addition, the level of parent-child activities provided by the hotel's children's club can be compared with CLUBMED, which is connotative and meaningful! The room is spacious and clean, the soft bed is very comfortable! The hotel environment is very OK, close to the beach, the hotel breakfast is also very good, the hotel is really high-end a**osphere. The environment, services, sanitation and other aspects are exemplary. Western food and Chinese food are all carefully crafted, delicious and cheap, and I like cut passion fruit. There is a small bar on the beach with a great a**osphere, a perfect trip to Wanning! The overall hotel experience of Westin is great. The style and service are especially suitable for young people. The big lawn with long sandy beach is so special. The balcony facing the lawn and the sea is really satisfying! Le M√©ridien next door is actually pretty good, but it‚Äôs a pity that there are no sea view rooms and large lawns like the Westin. We also went to see the Hilton in Shenzhou Peninsula, but the decoration is too old. Friends who come to Wanning recommend it Westin, secondly, I saw the evaluation of the hotel. The hotel is located in the center of Shimei Bay with a sea view, embracing the blue sea and lush flora. The lobby of the hotel is more than 20 meters high with a fully transparent and open design, and the space is extremely open. The lobby is facing Jiajing Island, with its back facing the Qingpi Forest, presenting the maximum vision and landscape, and you can have a panoramic view of the blue and open magnificent sea view when you look up. The hotel is equipped with an indoor 750„é° constant temperature swimming pool at about 24¬∞C, an outdoor 660„é° room temperature lagoon adult swimming pool and a 345„é° children's pool with a children's water slide. In particular, the walls and top of the indoor room temperature swimming pool are designed with large areas of transparent glass , highlighting the extremely open resting space, swimming in it, recovering your body and mind and rejuvenating your vitality. After reading this introduction, you think it is very good. The hotel room is equipped with a dehumidifier. When you check out and leave the next stop, you miss it very much. Home~ Before leaving, I took a photo with Da üë©üé§ The moment I came to Riyue Bay Sunac, my husband said, it‚Äôs so miserable, why didn‚Äôt I get the trea**ent in Shimei Bay üò≠ Different styles, but including the Sheraton behind, it should be I will never meet such a warm-hearted housekeeper and such a professional hotel like Xiaozheng again. I look forward to meeting you next time‚ù§

You can spend two or three days in the hotel. The restaurants are good. The main reason is that the service is very good, and parent-child activities are also very rich. It takes 5 minutes to reach the beach, and the child has to go down to play every day. She has a good time, and the parents will naturally have a comfortable vacation. Their butler service is very timely and very humane. Thank you, Xiao Kuang, the butler who served us this time. He made arrangements for us every day and also delivered fruits. The location of the hotel is good, and you can drive to any scenic spot within half an hour.

Sanya Hotel has a shuttle bus after landing at Sanya Airport, and you can also choose to rent a car for room facilities. : The size of the room is sufficient, and the standard facilities are equipped with hotel swimming pools, lawns, children's water slides on the beach, and children's play facilities are also very good, but there is an m1 coffee factory opposite the hotel. The hotel can learn from the M1 coffee variety. It is really delicious, and there are children Paradise, guests staying in the hotel can also get discounts. The service of the hotel is up to standard, which is in line with the enthusiasm of the 5-star staff. In comparison, Westin is generally better. I came here for the first time last year to check in to Westin The logo of Net Red Lawn. I brought my family here for two nights this year, but the logo can still be photographed from some angles in the room! The garden view room we booked was upgraded to a pool room. Both rooms have been upgraded, and the swimming pool is very nice when you go out. The room is big and you can drink for free from the minibar. Because the driver came by car, it is more convenient, but here I suggest to drive by yourself. It is very convenient. It is very convenient to go to the Shenzhou Peninsula and Boundary Island. I am very grateful to the housekeeper Xiaozheng who contacted me the day before I came and said that there is a room that can be upgraded for me and asked if I need it. Spare rooms can be selected, very good! Very careful, I prepared two bags of special products when I checked in on the day of my visit, which contained mangosteen fruit, sugar coffee, and local specialty tea, which was very considerate. He also told me about the interesting places nearby. Thank you so much for her hospitality! In addition, the hotel also gave free travel photos, and 10 photos can be collected for free! The staff responded quickly and met the needs of the guests as soon as possible. The breakfast is average, and the parents and children in the hotel did a good job. On the day of check-in, I gave the little friends slippers, bathrobes and toiletries, and there is a bubble pool at a fixed time every day. The children had a good time playing in the bubble pool. After the bubble pool, there is a circle around the hotel The key to the small train that goes around is free! There is a wilderness sheep tribe in the hotel, which provides free activities for guests with children. This super holding is also the most satisfying. It makes me feel what a parent-child hotel is like. , the whole day is full of activities, divided into indoor workshops in the morning and outdoor fun in the afternoon. There are 6 activities per day, which are not repeated every day. Each season is different. There are detective questions, special water activities, and themed entertainment , The activity is designed with care. You can stay in the hotel for a day without going out. They also have hosting activities. After hosting for a day, I chose the coconut tree climbing package. The teacher will share the child's information in the group in a timely manner, allowing me to go to Jiajing Island to go out to sea for a day to enjoy free time. The hotel facilities are complete, there are swimming pools for children and adults, and there is a private beach when you walk out of the lobby. The beach is clean and patrolled by security personnel . There are many play items on the beach. There are children's karts and video games in the hotel, which children like very much. The lobby will arrange magic, singing and dancing, and acrobatic performances at different times. Every time I go to the lobby, it is very lively. I have been to Hainan several times. I thought that Haitang Bay was the limit of a parent-child vacation. When I came here, I found Shimei Bay and discovered Haitang Bay. .

Before coming here, I compared Westin and Le Meridien, and finally chose Westin Creek Hotel. Xiaona, the housekeeper, contacted us in advance before checking in. She felt very caring, provided some information about check-in, confirmed the check-in time, and made room arrangements in advance. We stayed in a deluxe twin room with garden view. The room was clean and tidy. It was great that we could feel the coolness brought by the air conditioner as soon as we entered the room. Cortana butler is awesome üëç The drinks and fruits have already been prepared. During the stay, I took the children to swim in the indoor swimming pool and participated in the activities of the children's club. The arrangement was very good. The Yangyang Tribe has different activities every day, and we will make reservations in advance. The activity experience is very good. I have to say that the environment of the hotel is really good. You can take pictures everywhere. Outside the hotel is a beautiful beach. It is a holy place for children to play with water and sand. It is a joy to play. The hotel staff are very polite and will greet customers with sincerity. Another point is that the breakfast in the morning is good and rich, that is, you need to eat before 9 o'clock, and you will queue up to enter the dining area later. (The hotel arranges rooms on the 3rd floor so that you can roughly see a little of the sea. I visited the garden view room at the back and wondered if I arranged the wrong room, but I have already checked in at the back, so I don‚Äôt care too much. I am more Buddhist. people)

Bathtub shower and toilet are independent. The balcony is also very large, with deck chairs and a balcony for drying clothes. There are a lot of things to do in the hotel. The area is so large that there are small trains and bicycles. The children's pool has slides and bubbles to play. The parent-child hotel first recommends this [strong] children under 6 years old are free, and 6 to 12 years old are half price. The price/performance ratio is high, and the most impressive thing is that the service attitude is very good. If you have any requirements, you can feel that they will be satisfied as much as possible. The breakfast is very rich, as long as you are not particularly picky, you can fully satisfy it. Remember to make an appoin**ent one day in advance for the pick-up and drop-off. If there is a request in the room, it must be stated in advance, and the baby cot is provided free of charge. Not to mention the hotel environment, just take a photo with your mobile phone and it will be a beautiful view. There are also a lot of takeaways. For fear of safety issues with foreign food, they are not allowed to be delivered into the room. However, there is a takeaway cabinet next to the concierge in the lobby. Although you have to pick it up yourself, it is enough to prove that safety measures are in place. You can stay at ease. If you don't want to eat inside, there are small restaurants and convenience stores not far from the hotel. The room was clean and cleaned every day. When I see the cleaning aunts in the yard, they all smile and say hello, and the attitudes of the brothers and sisters at the front desk are not to be picky. Finally, let‚Äôs talk about the butler service. Before check-in, the butler Xiaozheng specially called to care about the needs of this stay, and helped arrange the room in advance the day before check-in. When he learned that my lumbar and cervical spine was not good, he arranged the bed carefully The cushions and buckwheat pillows gave me a beautiful night in Wanning. I was also told that the hotel will have a firework show in the lobby at night during my stay. I specially gave me the timetable so that I can occupy a beautiful viewing spot in advance. I would like to thank the housekeeper Xiaozheng again, and the contact is basically replied in seconds. We took the initiative to delay the time when we checked out, and we went to him directly for anything. It was handled very well for us. He made me feel that I can experience the St. Regis butler service in the Westin. The dishes in the hotel's Chinese restaurant are very delicious and worth experiencing. I will definitely do it next time Go and stay a few more nights, enjoy the beauty of the hotel's beach, and experience the high-quality hotel services. Thank you, I left my wife and I with a wonderful memory of our stay! Finally, let me talk about the hidden benefits of the hotel. The mini bar in the room is free, it is really very kind! This experience was great! Thanks again to those who helped me along the journey, thank you!

msg:If I hadn‚Äôt been bored and wandered around the lobby and watched the waves of guests coming and going at the front desk, I couldn‚Äôt believe that the Westin Shimei Bay, which I used to come to for peace, would be so full. Under such a big environment, Hainan After the rapid recovery of the tourism industry, it even exceeded the normal state before the epidemic. It is not easy for the staff, especially the service depar**ent, please understand more! But the room type design of this hotel is really great. You can see the sea when you line up. The service of the lady at the front desk is also very good. I believe they must really want to take good care of the customers, but according to my previous stays and observations of the hotel It is concluded that there are still a lot of sheltered rooms on the side sea. However, under the high intensity of traffic in the peak season, the service is really in place. The front desk will take the initiative to ask the guests if they are driving to help register the license plate. Wish me a happy ending of the call, and even after I accidentally called the service center and immediately hung up, they would call me back and apologize "I'm sorry I didn't receive your call just now, how can I help you" and I really The only thing is that I accidentally pressed the wrong button, which made me very embarrassed, and I also called out the butler Xiaozheng to praise him by name! I learned about my preferences the day before check-in, and predicted the arrival time to avoid waiting for me. I also sent afternoon tea cakes and fruits, and the WeChat reply was timely~ The two-day check-in was full of thoughtfulness! Give high praise to the high-quality service depar**ent. Summary. No matter how good the hotel is, there will be things that make you unhappy. Even if there are unpleasant things in this hotel, you will lose your temper. Five stars are for the service. If the service is not good, I will not Not to mention so much, I really like this hotel, especially my husband is full of praise, he is a very sensible and rigorous person! I regret not booking two more days. First of all, the hotel environment is also very good, especially the grass in front of the beach, which is simply a treasured place for babysitters and concave shapes! The sea view is also very beautiful, very clean, it is really pleasant to walk along the coastline, the children like it very much! Secondly, the service is super good, because the child‚Äôs eyes are uncomfortable and I want to delay check-out, I agree with it, and I am very concerned about the child‚Äôs condition. The waiter picked up my ring and sprinted 100 meters to return it to me immediately. superior! Again, the hotel's breakfast is rich in variety and tastes good! If you don't eat in the hotel, there is a commercial street five minutes away, with various snack restaurants, coffee, pharmacies, and China Resources Vanguard Supermarket, which is very convenient. The main reason is that there are several restaurants in the resort, and the Chinese restaurant is very good! The facilities are good, covering an area of ‚Äã‚Äã250,000 square meters, the lobby has 10,000 square meters. Wow, the beach, outdoor splash, indoor swimming pool, and beach are all well managed. The sea view room we chose for the personal guest room is very large, so you don‚Äôt have to delay your work while watching the sea and taking a bath! The consumption in the resort is also close to the people, 68 for a cocktail, 198 for afternoon tea for two, and 260+ for Chinese food for two! In short, the design is ingenious, the service is gentle and professional, and the a**osphere is magnificent. This time we stayed in three hotels in Wanning, only the Westin moved us, it is suitable for the second brush! It is suitable for bringing the whole family to play in the resort. Happy, give Westin a thumbs up! Easter eggs: The shower room in the guest room is super suitable for bathing and singing, with stereo surround sound, the effect is comparable to a recording studio! Finally, there are discounts for hotel guests to play glider. I also like this. All three members of the family challenged it. In short, it is very worth choosing, especially for those who are lazy or vacationers. It is a good choice to stay for two more days‚úå

msg:For children, the bubble party ocean ball is the most interesting, and for adults, the hard bar and sea projects are the most interesting. The hotel service, catering types and tastes, and the facilities are all excellent, but the most worth mentioning is the hotel lobby, which is quite grand, super large, and directly faces the sea, taking pictures without filters is very big. It's a pity that the lady at the front desk arranged for the 3rd floor, and you can only see a little bit of the sea. The 6th floor should be great. I don't have any experience in living here for the first time. It's very nice to take a photo on the way to the beach. The downside is that the children's swimming pool is quite dirty, with a lot of fallen leaves and scum in the water, and I hope to increase the frequency of cleaning.

msg:When we arrived at Shimei Bay on the evening of the 15th, the hotel lobby shocked us, and we could see a very beautiful sea view at a glance. We have a large number of people with 5 children and want to arrange the rooms in adjoining positions. Xiao Kuang, the manager on duty at the front desk, Xiao Kuang, the housekeeper, made us feel at home. They are very enthusiastic and have a good service attitude, because it is the peak season and they have been coordinating for a long time, only two rooms can be together. Finally, the political manager upgraded our other three rooms to a villa room for free to live together, and gave us special toiletries for children, as well as free drinks and fruits, which surprised us very much. We originally planned to stay for only two nights and ended up staying for an extra night. The hotel room is very comfortable and hygienic, and the whole decoration is very a**ospheric. The hotel has many large and small swimming pools, beautiful sea views and soft sand. The most important thing is that there are so many hotel service staff with good attitudes. So after our vacation, we would like to thank the manager Xiaoye Xiaokuangzheng and the young guy who picked up the concierge. Their enthusiasm and meticulous service made our vacation very pleasant. We will come to the beautiful Shimei Bay again next time.

msg:It was the first time I visited Wanning, and I booked the Westin Shimei Bay for two days this time, which completely exceeded expectations. The personal butler, Ms. Kuang, called and added WeChat in advance to inquire about various needs. During the stay, she would ask about the situation every day. Because my foot was injured, it was inconvenient for me to move, and the children liked to play in the children's pool, so Ms. Kuang also helped me upgrade to a sea view room next to the children's pool, so that I could walk less. It was really considerate. The children didn't have sand digging tools, so Ms. Kuang directly helped to apply for a new set of sand digging tools and delivered them to the room, which is really great! The sea view in the lobby is really beautiful, and the service at the front desk is also very good. They try their best to satisfy everything they need, and the foreign friends performing are very friendly! There is also a lovely penguin teacher with a good temper, the children love him so much! The whole hotel environment is quite beautiful, the only drawback is that the room bathroom washing area is a bit cramped, but the Westin bed is so comfortable, you can really sleep in seconds when you lie on it. Ms. Kuang also made a guide for visiting nearby and sent it to me, which was very detailed. We went to the Internet celebrity lighthouse on the Shenzhou Peninsula according to the strategy, and we regretted that we should have stayed at the Westin Shimei Bay for the entire trip, and we will stay again next time. The hotel's children's activities (Sheep and Goat Club) are very rich, and children are not bored every day. Personally, I think Westin's breakfast is very good, and the daily refreshing and refreshing can be solved in the hotel. I will come again next time and hope to meet Ms. Kuang again.

Westin makes me feel very warm and homely. I get used to exercising and doing yoga at 7 o'clock every day. There is a yoga room on the first floor. I just had breakfast after practicing. It is very suitable for me, comfortable‚ûïN
Opposite the hotel is a shopping mall, there are a lot of food, very convenient, it is a hotel that I want to stay in next time.
The only unacceptable thing is that the bedding is too soft and uncomfortable. I hope it can be improved, otherwise I will not sleep well

Even the master at the door will not take the initiative to help take the luggage out of the car. That's all. False words: Help you upgrade to xx, in fact, I spent this money to book this room. Other hotels are really upgraded, you are talking nonsense. The worst thing is that because of work, I can only travel in the summer vacation, and I only booked it when I saw an adult swimming pool. In the end, there was a training class in the swimming pool for children to play. There are teachers rowing in the swimming pool, children playing games in teams, and grandmas entering the water without a swimsuit... Five minutes into the swimming pool, you can't stand itching all over... There are so many children during the summer vacation, but there are also many college students, couples, and the elderly travel. The hotel already has a special children's entertainment pool and leisure area for children, and there are also training courses. In the secluded adult swimming pool, I can only say that the resort hotel is really bad... It is said on the Internet that travel is to relax, but some people travel But the journey was bumpy and tiring... just because there is such a hotel that is only for profit, messing up the market. If I spend 500 for one night, this experience is nothing to say. But I spent 2,000 yuan a night. According to the income standard of Chinese people, it is considered a good hotel in China. Let your own people go.

We missed the 12 o'clock bus because our plane was late, and we didn't want to wait for three hours, so we had to call a car by ourselves.

msg:Seeing is believing.
After I booked the hotel, I saw a lot of positive comments, and they all said that the Westin of Ai Meimei was not good.
The room is very good, the air conditioner is on 24 hours, but there is a dryer in the bathroom that works 24 hours, so it will not be cold when taking a shower, and it will be cool after washing.
The hotel facilities are relatively complete, and they are quite new. There are no old problems in the previous reviews. However, looking back at the hotel's exterior wall from the logo beach is a bit mottled, but it's not a big problem if I don't take photos of the hotel.
There are paragliding delta wing snorkeling and surfing on the beach downstairs of the hotel, which is quite fun, although in the end we went to Riyue Bay for surfing hhh.
There are many types of breakfast, but I personally don't think it's delicious, but my friend thinks it's delicious.
When you check in, the front desk will ask you if you need butler service. It‚Äôs good to add a butler. You can explain everything to him, and you can ask him if you don‚Äôt know the situation. I like the butler Xiaofeng.
Let me talk about the shortcomings. One is that the balconies of a row of rooms are parallel, and the privacy of the balconies is relatively low. Everyone can see each other. The other is that when we go down to the outdoor swimming pool to get a public swimming ring, we have to sign and draw a deposit. We have repeatedly explained that if it is damaged, we will have to pay for it. We wear swimsuits and stand in the water to write our name, room number, phone number, and name and room number. It's a bit embarrassing. It's a bit annoying for a five-star hotel to do this. If it really messes up the infringement, you can claim compensation without a contract. It's really disappointing to sign a contract as soon as you get into the water.

msg:The overall stay experience is good.

It's a pity that the local government and environmental protection depar**ent in Wanning, Hainan, have not done enough to protect the coastline. Fishing net ropes, empty bottles, plastic bags for snacks, cigarette butts, and white foam can be seen everywhere on the beach of the two hotels in Shimei Bay.

Sea view: very beautiful

Room: clean, tidy, equipped with a dehumidifier

Bathroom: clean and tidy. But on the first day of check-in, it was a bit of an aftertaste, but it disappeared later

Beach: The hotel arranges staff to clean up the rubbish left on the beach by hotel guests and tourists every morning. But before leaving the store in the morning, I picked up a lot with the guests along the coastline. Especially the surf on the side of the hotel üèÑüèª a bit, there is garbage everywhere.

Greening: There are layers of greening in the hotel. It's a pity that I witnessed the lifeguard at the swimming pool using a long pole to drive away the little squirrels watching the lychee trees in the green belt. I was a little disappointed in this ecological island that flaunts the full integration of man and nature. Although the hotel conveniently stated that this was done to prevent the lychees gnawed by squirrels from falling and "injuring people"... After communicating with Yu Hotel, I did not see such a situation happening again during the week of stay. Hope Hotel pays attention to ecology, cares for wild animals and stray animals.

Breakfast: very rich, Hainan pineapple üçç is especially good

Chinese restaurant on the first floor: rich dishes, good taste, and enough dishes

Gym: Full range of equipment, high quality, that is, it is not recommended to play too intense background music when exercising, and it is advisable to control low decibels.

Surroundings: The beach is open, there are many residential residents and tourists driving to the hotel near the hotel, the beach barbecue smells great and there is a lot of garbage.

Pets: pet-friendly hotel, I met a girl from Beijing who drove her pet dog to the hotel. I hope that friends who walk their dogs on the beach consciously bring paper and bags for picking up poop üí©, which is convenient for others and for themselves.

Stray animals: I hope the hotel will take care of and feed stray cats, neuter them, and provide them with regular cat food and water. There are many snakes and rats in Hainan, and rat poison alone cannot solve long-term problems.

Hotel entertainment: There are karts for adults and children to play, and other games and other children's entertainment facilities, etc.

Coconuts: Not far from the hotel, the average price of coconuts on the side of the road is 8 yuan, and there is a shop farther away that sells 5 yuan each

Sightseeing: It is recommended to go to the Botanical Garden of Xinglong Overseas Chinese Farm. The dishes of a Nyonya Overseas Chinese Restaurant in Xinglong Town are delicious and affordable; the dim sum of the Nanyang style restaurant is worth tasting.

Friends who go out on a yacht, be sure to bring the garbage back with youüå∏üå∏üå∏

There are two large bedrooms, a large living room, a dining room, three bathrooms, and a large lawn courtyard. I am so satisfied. The most important thing is that there is zero distance from the beach, and it is close to the children's pool and the indoor heated swimming pool. The children did not swim back to "home" until 9 o'clock. The hotel provided fruit, and everything in the indoor dining bar is free, even the red wine is free. We enjoyed French fries, sparkling water, and beer, which was very good. The hotel's parent-child activities are also very rich. We participated in coconut tree climbing, coconut picking, camping, and bonfire parties. The children have unlimited energy. Fortunately, there are these activities. The watermelon teacher in the club is very patient and handsome, thank you.

After cleaning the thick soil at the air inlet, it resumed normal operation. And the hotel as a whole is too hot, super stuffy, and looks very old everywhere, sorry for the name of the old luxury hotel Westin.

Environment: The natural environment is very good, the beach is clean and the waves are gentle

Service: This is the morning buffet that irritates me the most. I found a table by the glass window, but there were plates on the table that should have been finished by the previous table. I will come back and ask me to change the table. I said that I will go to pick up the food first. When I get it back, I will collect it if no one comes back. As a result, I went back and forth to get four plates of food and still no one came back. I asked her to collect the table and she still didn‚Äôt Ken! Simply speechless! Even angry! üò°üò°üò° So I complained to my housekeeper! The housekeeper apologized and comforted me, so I didn't have a bad mood for playing. However, this behavior really has to be criticized!

The swimming pool looks out from the room, the scenery is good, the room near the sea is very humid, and each room has a dehumidifier. Issues raised were quickly resolved. VIP fruit and a cake were also given. Knowing that I was severely sunburned, I sent a large jar of aloe vera gel. Really good service. Breakfast lasts until 10:30, and the variety is also very rich.

Check-in was quite fast this time, there was no queue, and the check-in time for our three rooms should be within 10 minutes. There is a welcome drink at the door, and there are performances in the lobby, which has a super holiday a**osphere.
The only fly in the oin**ent is the musty smell in the room, but this is understandable, because it is too humid, and the clothes take a long time to dry in the sun. I thought I had seen wet weather before in Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai, so I refreshed my knowledge here.
The breakfast is very good, with a variety of varieties. From 6:30 to 10:00, you can eat super full, and you can save lunch. You can also DIY refreshments, but it is a pity that there is no glutinous rice.
There are outdoor buffets in the evening, which are very lively and cool with the sea breeze.
There is also a travel photo shoot. The day we went was quite empty, and we made an appoin**ent an hour in advance. After taking the photo, we chose it ourselves. There are many water sports on the beach, so we didn‚Äôt experience it with our children.

Seeing that we brought the baby, she took the initiative to give more drinking water, and tidy up the baby's baby comfort toys, as if at home.
The disadvantage is that the beach is back to mud, and one day it rains heavily, the whole sea water is yellow, and there is an illusion of going to the Yellow Sea. The layout of the room is very strange. The bathtub is on the balcony but the privacy is very poor and basically unusable. There are also a lot of bugs, ants, moths, and snails cannot open the balcony door at night, and the sound of music outside when it is not raining.

Due to the flight delay, I missed the hotel shuttle bus, but I still thank Herry for her thoughtful and meticulous service and Arrangement, although I didn't upgrade the room, but Xiaofeng chose a garden view room with a very good location for me. I can see the Westin lawn logo and the endless sea when I wake up in the morning~ It's so comfortable
The hotel's breakfast was not bad, and it didn't surprise me. I ate Huainan Beef Noodles on the first morning, and Hou'an Soup Noodles on the second morning. It was quite special.
It‚Äôs good for refreshing and cooling. Coconut milk is delicious and not sweet. You have to have a bowl every morning.
On the second night, we also went to have a dinner barbecue buffet, 298 yuan/person
In the same place as breakfast, there are grilled oysters, grilled scallops, etc. The oysters are not bad, but the scallops are too small, and the taste is not good. The surprise is that there is a hot pot in the barbecue buffet. I chose dross vinegar and coconut chicken soup base , Dross vinegar is used to cook beef, shrimp, shellfish, etc. Coconut chicken is used to cook Wenchang chicken and corn. I have tried them all, but to be honest, I am not used to eating them. I feel that the ingredients in Hainan It's good, but the seasoning is very strange, especially the yellow lantern chili sauce, I don't like it.

msg:The biggest surprise of our trip to Wanning was staying at the Westin. My husband said it was great when he came to surf before. This time, four of our friends came to play and arranged to stay for two consecutive nights. The experience was great!
First of all, the housekeeper Mile contacted us and added WeChat before we checked in. He gave us a warm reminder. During the check-in process, he was also very enthusiastic to show us the room and answer every question, which saved us a lot of worry! A good hotel is inseparable from good butler service, which Westin has done really well! The young butler is enthusiastic, energetic and patient, very nice!
Secondly, the overall design of the hotel is very a**ospheric and the facilities are complete, clean and hygienic! Because I stayed for two nights and brought my child with me, I called the front desk many times to arrange a shuttle bus. The waiters were very friendly!
Let‚Äôs talk about the meal. We ordered a barbecue buffet by the sea on the first night. The ingredients are still very good and very rich! There is also a special person to arrange to book a good location, and to eat directly after the game. It is so comfortable to eat delicious food against the sunset. On that day, a resident singer was also arranged. The a**osphere is great üëç After eating, I walked to the beach to participate in the bonfire party! That's called hi! Daughter had a great time!
Finally, it is worth mentioning that the children in the hotel's swimming pool are also very happy, and the afternoon tea is also good üëç
It was a very happy and unforgettable trip. Thank you butler Mile for your hospitality! Looking forward to seeing you again! It is worthy of five-star recommendation to everyone!

msg:This is a serious and active evaluation. Hope this helps moms with kids. üòÄ There are two online celebrity hotels in Wanning, Le M√©ridien and Westin. We stayed at Le M√©ridien earlier in the journey, and we stayed at Westin for three days. To be honest, compared to Emmy, our group, whether we are children or adults, prefer Westin. Westin is better in every way. The decoration style and hotel services are also more dynamic and proactive. It is more suitable for family couples and parent-child vacations.
In Le Meridien, there are separate restaurants for general room type and villa dining. The restaurant for general room type is small, and the dishes are not many and are not often changed. Upgrade us to the sea-view restaurant dedicated to the villa area. Although it is small, the dishes are slightly better. However, Westin has a lot of dishes, which are different every day. The hall is also large so it will not look crowded. There is also a children's play area for children in the restaurant, so that mothers can have breakfast with peace of mind. The freshly squeezed juices that are only available in the dining area of Le M√©ridien Villas are served in a half-and-a-half cup. In Westin, you can drink as much as you want, which is more generous and comfortable. It is also a garden double room, but the Westin garden double room can see the sea and is more spacious. In addition to the hotel's all-day parent-child activities, the children's swimming pool in the hotel has large slides and rocking boats and other equipment. The water is not deep, and children can play all day; the indoor and outdoor swimming pools for adults are very large, and the adult indoor swimming pool is next to the indoor children's pool. The paddling pool is also thoughtfully separated by a very high baffle. When adults are swimming, children can play with more peace of mind. There will be a performance around 8pm. From a small detail, Westin's adult and children's bathrobes are also softer and more comfortable, and they don't prick the skin so much.
The housekeeper Xiaona is also positive and enthusiastic. On the first day of check-in, I learned that some children even gave small cakes and fruits! Make people feel right at home!
Generally, it is rare to write such a heartfelt review. But Westin really made the stay quite satisfactory. I originally wanted to stay for a few more days, forget it, just leave a thought for the next time we meet!

In particular, I would like to thank the housekeeper, Ms. Fu, for the well-arranged birthday presentation and birthday cake, which made me feel very warm. The room is clean and bright. On the beach, the hotel has specially paved green grass. This is the best place. Sitting on the grass and watching the sea is a good choice. Tips, the hotel has a free bus from Sanya Airport to the hotel, with a timetable attached.

Sitting in the courtyard and listening to the sea feels good. You can also drink from the mini bar on the first day. There is Nescafe capsule coffee. Before I checked in, the housekeeper Mile contacted me and carefully introduced the hotel situation. There are many activities in the hotel. Basically, there are courses for children every hour. You can sign up for it through a small program. We participated in the bubble show and the little ones played. I am very happy and thank the butler Mile again. During the stay, the child injured his hand. The hotel was very concerned about the situation and called several times to inquire about the situation. He also sent a small cake to show his condolences. It was a pleasant stay experience and will come again next time

I stayed in a family suite with a large room size. Vicky Xiaoyun contacted me a day in advance to ask if I had any special needs. Because the baby is still too young, she asked her to help install the fence for the bed. Here I would like to thank her again for her thoughtful service and welcome fruit.

One day in advance, a dedicated butler will contact you to ask if you need to call a car, and can help you find a courier in advance. At your service throughout your stay. My housekeeper, Tingting, served very well. On the first night, I even sent a small cake, which tasted pretty good.
Play: The entire park + swimming pool + beach, there are not many people, and the privacy is okay, suitable for relaxing vacations.
Accommodation: We lived in a garden view room with a large balcony and a couch, except for the sound of birds chirping.
Eat: There are many types of breakfast, the environment is not bad, and it is very quiet. You can enjoy breakfast slowly. Compared with Tianyu, there are few types of breakfast and the environment is noisy. It is simply a vegetable market. You have to turn on the "war" mode for breakfast.
Parent-child: Parent-child activities are of high quality and are basically free. Check in into the group,
Make an appoin**ent one day in advance, because there are not many children, and there are many interactions with the teacher, and the teacher will help take pictures.
Suggestion: 1. The steps in the shower area of the room are not high enough. There will be water outside after taking a shower. You can put a towel on the outside floor or improve it.
2. At a certain time in the afternoon, you can prepare free snacks for children at a certain venue. It is first come first served, similar to Tianyu. After all, there are very few dining options around Westin.
3 It is suggested to increase the operating frequency of small trains in the park.

     Before I checked in, the hotel's little butler Mile contacted me in advance, and asked me about my various requirements carefully, and tried my best to meet them. So when I checked in, the room was already arranged and ready to move in. After check-in, I also sent a welcome fruit plate and a four-inch fruit cake, which is really considerate.
    Of course, the service doesn't stop there. The hotel has a variety of children's play items, all of which are given away. Personally, I prefer travel photography. The caring butler Mile, according to our request, helped us make an appoin**ent for the travel photography service at sunset, and the hotel sent five free photos. There is also a drone aerial photography service. The experience is very good.
    The room is big enough and comfortable enough. You can sit on the balcony at night and watch the stars. When you check in, it is the Spring Festival. At night, you can enjoy the gorgeous fireworks from the balcony.
     The hotel's restaurants are basically punched. The breakfast is quite rich and tastes good. However, during peak hours, it is recommended that you try to eat before 9 o'clock, otherwise you will need to wait in line. During the Spring Festival, looking at the reviews of restaurants outside, people were severely cut off. It is better to eat in the hotel. Although the consumption is not low, the service and taste are very good.
     In the evening buffet by the beach, there are many choices, and the key point is various performances, a gluttonous feast for all kinds of visual and taste.
     The most beautiful beach in Wanning is Shimei Bay. During the peak tourist period, Shimei Bay is full of people. Although there are many people on the independent beach of the hotel, you can still enjoy the beautiful sunset and enjoy the sunny beach. Love this hotel. Wanning is more suitable for summer. If you go to Wanning in the future, you will definitely consider Westin Wanning as soon as possible.
     The recommendation index is five stars.

Shimei Bay, Le M√©ridien and Westin are next to each other. I was struggling to choose between these two. After reading many comments from netizens, it was the children's activities in this hotel that attracted me, so I chose Westin! It turned out to be a great experience! Families with children can come and experience it. Children‚Äôs activities are different every day. It is carefully designed and fully prepared at first glance!
üì£Children's activitiesüëâüèªReminder to parents, when you arrive at the hotel, join the Tingbao event reservation group as soon as possible. Every night around 8 o'clock, the reservation link will be sent in the group. If you forget things like me, you must set the alarm üòÇ Because it will be booked out soon. . . There are about five or six activities every day, all of which are free (only biscuit pizza food needs to be paid). I feel that most of them are "quiet" activities, most of which are handicrafts. After the children have played wildly, they can calm down and do handicrafts. Be patient and friendly to children, sorry for not remembering the names one by one. . .
üì£Hotel entertainment facilities üëâüèª There are several dessert carts in the lobby, especially ice cream, 40 balls, very strong taste ~ The children's pool is outdoors, there will be bubble parties, the indoor pool is a constant temperature pool, the water temperature is very suitable ~ the fitness center is not Big, you need to swipe your room card to enter~ There is a small game hall on the first floor, you can buy coins to play, basically 2 coins at a time, there is a machine, 1 coin at a time, just shake a lollipop üç≠ My two children , After playing with all the machines, I used the last ten or so coins left to shake lollipops. Basically, 1 coin is exchanged for 1 lollipopüç≠It‚Äôs so beautiful! At night, I clocked in the luminous car, specially selected internet celebrity dolphin model, and drove it to the small road of the hotel.
üì£Dining üëâüèªThe breakfast is too good, you must go early, I have seen that the line started to line up almost after 9:30 in the two days I lived, and I had chicken feet for breakfast on the first day, my wife. . . too delicious! The breakfast was gone the next day. I replaced it with char siu buns, and it was delicious~ Recommended recommendation~ I ate out of the hotel for lunch and dinner. I searched for some good places around, or brought takeaways back to the hotel to eat. Blowing the sea breeze on the balcony, overlooking the horizon, the delicious food and beautiful scenery~
üì£Hotel environment and serviceüëâüèª Before I checked in, Vicky, the guest relations director, added me on WeChat in advance and asked me what requirements I had for checking in. I also personally provided services for me when I arrived at the hotel. During the stay, I would "harass" if I had any questions She, she has been patiently and meticulously providing me with the best service. For example, she specially arranged a room close to the children's pool and the elevator. She prepared the children's supplies in the room in advance and reminded me that it was 8 in the evening. Don't forget to book activities for your kids. . . On the last day, I made an appoin**ent for 10:30 to take pictures of my two children, and I will definitely have to play with sand all over the beach.

The room we live in is just like the housekeeper, Xiaona, who is also super caring for us. We chose such a good location and gave us welcome fruits and cakes. Weiss ordered it. I have stayed in many hotels. This hotel is really suitable for bringing children. The supporting facilities are all available. Open the balcony door and sit and watch the children. The children like this room so much. I feel like I don‚Äôt have to go out every day to play on the pool slide at noon. I regret that I should have stayed here for 5 days in Wanning. When the kids are hungry at the pool, I eat at the Chinese restaurant on the second floor of the hotel. The taste is quite satisfactory and the price is good. Buying a package online is good value for money. You can continue to play in the heated swimming pool in the hotel at night. The swimming pool is not too good. The standard 50-meter-long ultra-clean shower room and sauna room are all available. Breakfast is close to the beach. Although we have to wait a while But the scenery is still very good. It is really comfortable to have breakfast outdoors in this season. Next time you come to Wanning, you will definitely stay here again.
Service: Xiaona, the housekeeper at the front desk, is super considerate

I prefer the view from the twin room. Since the twin room is closer to the lobby, there are various performances and singing every day, and you can hear the singing without going out. The room environment is still considered clean. It is relatively humid near the sea. Every room has a dehumidifier. My baby still has allergic dermatitis. Fortunately, there is a pharmacy opposite the hotel, which is quite convenient.

Eat: The hotel's breakfast is very rich, and there will be a little update every day, so you won't get tired of eating after staying for three or four days. The hotel's Ferris wheel afternoon tea is a feature, the price is not bad, and the baby's freshly squeezed juice is free. The dinner and Chinese meal set meal for two is 398 yuan, and the dishes are very good. In the evening, you can go to the beach üèñ bar for a drink.

Play: The kids can play a lot, three days can not be repeated, karting, small train, bubble show, outdoor swimming pool, indoor swimming pool, indoor children's playground, ice and fire show, and organize activities for children of different ages every day, As long as you are willing to spend money on various water sports, paragliding and helicopters can be played without leaving the hotel.

Friendly reminder: to go to the duty-free shop, you must go to the concierge depar**ent to make an appoin**ent two days in advance, because the two hotels share the same bus, and the good time is easy to be selected. We made an appoin**ent one day in advance this time and missed the good time slot.

There is a dross fish hot pot (you must not miss his Hou'an powder) which is very delicious, and the seafood next door tastes amazing (better than other places).
     Special thanks to classmate Xu (Xu Lixiang), the housekeeper of the room, very caring and excellent service, careful, patient and warm-hearted, must be a five-star praise! !

When I arrived at the hotel at noon that day, I checked in quickly and the waiter guided me all the way to the room. The weather is fine these days, with blue sea and blue sky, coconut groves and white sand. I have to say that the scenery of Westin Shimei Bay is really amazing, and it is a blockbuster to take casually.
The restaurant on the second floor has good taste and rich cuisine, which can meet the needs of customers with different tastes. The evening buffet dishes on the first floor are not very rich, there are not many seafood, and the quality is average. The price of 358 per person can only be considered passable. The breakfast is good and very rich. The Ting Bar in the lobby is in a good location, facing the sea, with the breeze blowing, very pleasant.

The children never got tired of it, which greatly liberated their parents; the professional level of the hotel is amazing! Xiaona, the hotel housekeeper, contacted us in advance and added WeChat. Since we still have elderly and children, not only did we check in at the priority counter, but also carefully considered the children, and gave us snack cards and welcome cakes, which made us feel warmer. Xiaona also actively answered and solved various questions we raised. Knowing that the customer was celebrating her birthday in the store, she specially prepared a birthday decoration for her.

The scenery of afternoon tea is invincible, which is my favorite part of the hotel. The adults and children of the swimming pool are separated on two wings. Because of the cold weather, I didn't go to the adult swimming pool. The children's swimming pool is also cold water, and those who are brave can go into the water. We only spent two days in the indoor heated swimming pool. The beach is very good, suitable for children to play in the water, and the surfing is mainly concentrated in front of Emmy. There are many beauties on the hardbar on the beach to take pictures, and there are many white people. It is difficult to find a seat. I lie down and drink some cocktails and watch the children dig the sand. I feel very happy. The barbecue open-air movie bar on the other side is full of a**osphere. These two places are highly recommended. The indoor children's playground is small, but there are various parent-child activities every day, including outdoor sports, handicrafts, games, wild survival, food making... not bad. Finally, I want to say that Wanning during the Spring Festival is really quite cold!

The green environment and the beach are the most satisfying places for our trip around the island. The beach is very long, and there is always a place to put a puppy that doesn't disturb others.

The breakfast is very rich, and there are local characteristics, to achieve refreshing and refreshing. In the evening dinner at the Chinese restaurant on the first day of junior high school, the overall seafood cooking was also very good.

After talking about the advantages, talk about the disadvantages. The hotel has two shortcomings:
1. The switchboard is basically available before 8:00. No one answered, tried for several days in a row, half an hour each time, basically no one. No matter how many people there are, a five-star star needs to pay attention to these details. If there is an urgent matter, the sky should not be called and the earth should not be heard.
2. It is necessary to strengthen the attitude and etiquette of the staff to treat guests, so as not to make guests feel that they are being censored like prisoners. In the outdoor area, early in the morning, a staff member in sportswear came over from a distance to ask if we were hotel guests, and then asked if we had signed a pet agreement. First of all, if the front desk process is unified, the agreement has been signed when checking in. The staff asked repeatedly, was he questioning the management level of his hotel? Second, the staff member said we came from the other side of the beach, so suspected that we were the owners? To be honest, no one is guarding the beach, and no security isolation measures are used, not to mention that the place we walked over is the beach outside the villa. He stopped the guests for interrogation at will, what is the effect? Not to mention that we are genuine residents! The whole process does not end with a simple question, but a series of questions. If I hadn't complained harshly, the security guards who had been walking towards us in the distance would seem to have joined in the eviction? This kind of experience is really bad, and it is definitely not what a large resort hotel under the Westin chain should look like.

In such a full state, she upgraded the room and gave me a fruit gift. Butler service is very proactive and thoughtful. In this peak season, it is very important to meet good reception staff.

When checking in, there were too many people at the front desk to queue up. Xiao Xu also helped with the check-in procedures, which was very considerate! The hotel room is a detached two-bedroom villa with sea view. It is very spacious and comfortable for four people to travel. It would be perfect if there is a mahjong table. In the evening, the butler brought welcome fruit ~ the weather‚òÅÔ∏è is cloudy and the sea breeze is a bit strong, I hope it will be a good weather next time I come back!

Originally, I didn't have high hopes for Marriott's catering, but I didn't expect that the breakfast at Westin Shimei Bay was rich and delicious.
It is also worth mentioning that the butler Tingting has thoughtful service. I contacted and added WeChat one day in advance to ask if there are any special needs in the two rooms. I can arrange them as much as possible. After arriving at the store, I will take care of the whole process and remind you of the activities every day. up.

msg:As long as you have stayed once, you will come to the hotel countless times!
The first thing to do after restrictions are lifted is to travel with your family
The itinerary in Wanning chose the Westin Shimei Bay Hotel
Perfect holiday at the hotel
Service: First of all, Westin has a professional butler service. After the reservation was successful, I received a call from the butler Xiao Xu, asking about the accommodation requirements and preferences, and introduced me to the places to play around. I also arranged buckwheat pillows and welcome fruits , because my mother likes their house very much, the housekeeper also helped to upgrade the room, and I was reluctant to leave the balcony with sea view. When I checked in, I also helped to draw a map of the hotel and introduced the restaurant of the hotel, so I chose to have dinner in the hotel restaurant. It really felt like going home, great butler service!
Facilities: The hotel has an outdoor swimming pool and a heated swimming pool as well as a 24-hour gym, and outdoor towels are also provided for hotel guests. There are also lifeguards on the beach to check the situation at any time. The hotel also has a number of restaurants to meet the needs of lying flat, but there are a little few outdoor beach chairs. Now in the peak season, lying down for a while, surrounded by coughing people, I am a little scared. It is recommended to add some beach chairs.
Environment: The environment of the hotel is nothing to say. It has an invincible sea view of Shimei Bay, opposite to Jiajing Island, and the big lawn with the word Westin. It is my favorite. I can‚Äôt get enough photos.
Be sure not to miss the hotel's breakfast, there are more than a dozen kinds of bread alone! It's so blissful to have breakfast while watching the seaside!
From the moment I checked in, I wanted to stay for another night. Staying for one night is not enough for fun. Unfortunately, the itinerary can't be changed. I suggest you come to the Westin. I love it~

The room I stayed in was a double room with a garden view. The room was very large and the facilities were quite new. The Heavenly bed is as comfortable as ever, but the pillows are a bit too high.
The receptionist this time is Tingting, the housekeeper, who added WeChat two or three days in advance. The service is meticulous and responsive. During the period, I was a little sensitive to the smell of the room, and she immediately found an air purifier. Thank you for your three days of attentive service.

msg:First time to Wanning
Between emmy and westin chose the latter
After the experience, I found that this decision was still correct!

The butler will contact you two days before check-in
Inquire about your arrival time, room requirements, etc.
My housekeeper is Tingting
This stay has provided me with a lot of convenience
For example, the past few days were cloudy and windy
She keeps reminding me to remember to wear thick clothes and wait
In short, hin is considerate! Be sure to boast!

The entire lobby of Westin is tall and grand
The lobby bar is opposite to Jiajing Island
It's nice to drink afternoon tea here when the weather is nice
The room is a sea view room with a great view
You can take a bath on the balcony and watch the scenery
The room size is also very large and comfortable
The fast service at the front desk responds quickly
If something is missing or something is broken, someone will take care of it within ten minutes of making a phone call.
The spare parts are Westin's own, and the taste is white tea and aloe vera, which smells pretty good.
The outdoor swimming pool is very good for taking pictures, but the weather in December really makes it impossible to go into the water
The indoor swimming pool is also very big, there is also a gym, etc.
In short, it has everything a resort hotel should have.
But after exaggerating the advantages, I always have to talk about it
(Yes, I am so fair. After all, I come to live with real money and no promotion fee.

First of all, the configuration of the bathroom is a bit disappointing
The first time I stayed in such an expensive hotel is not a smart toilet
It's true that the shower doesn't have an exhaust system
So there will be some sewer smell
The hotel currently provides dehumidifiers
I don't know if there will be another way in the future
Furthermore, the TV in such a big room is indeed a bit too small
It happened to be the World Cup final when I stayed
The small TV is really a bit boring.
There is also the breakfast that was well received before
Maybe it's because it's on the first floor
the light is not very good
The most transparent lighting is in the lobby, which is the second floor
So it makes people feel that the place for breakfast is dark
Many dish names need to be read carefully, otherwise they will not be clear
The taste is mediocre
There are few fruits, watermelon disappears quickly, some pineapples are black
In short, there are indeed many varieties of breakfast
But because of the poor light, some varieties are hard to find
The taste didn't surprise me either.

The package I bought includes travel photos sent by the hotel
"Green Image"
The little brother who helped me take pictures is Guo Zheng
Looks like it was taken by a professional traveler.
The conductor's posture is very natural.
Good technique and patience

All in all as a resort hotel
Westin can't be wrong
But to be honest, the Westin on a sunny day has 90 points
Westin on a cloudy day is estimated to be only 60 points
The resort hotel is still a feast for God
Everyone is optimistic about the weather forecast

Every afternoon from 15:00 to 16:00, there will be a bubble party in the children's pool, which the children love very much. During the stay, there happened to be the Porsche China Cup, and several Porsche sports cars were exhibited, and the children liked it very much. The hotel is very close to the beach.

In the end, we were pleasantly surprised with red wine, cakes, and roses. It was so thoughtful. The hotel lobby is still very airy, you can see the sea at a glance, the breakfast variety is quite rich, and there is also Hainan Qingbuliang, which is quite good. The most important thing is that the hotel arranges a shuttle bus to Sanya Airport, which is very convenient. But I hope that the service in the hotel lobby can be more proactive and enthusiastic. For example, I can learn from other hotels of the same level that they take the initiative to wear welcome necklaces for guests and other warm services.

We arrived at the hotel ahead of time, and Vicky even found a temporary room for us to rest. Thank you very much. The hotel has a very good environment and is suitable for taking pictures. The restaurant is on the first floor The western food is very good, and the breakfast is also very rich. It is much more than other five-star dishes. The hotel's beach items are also very rich, such as ATVs, speedboats, helicopters, and the hotel can also help you contact the yacht package. I am very happy after the day. It is a good trip .

At noon one day before departure, the housekeeper, Xiaona, contacted by phone to ask in advance what special needs she needs. She added WeChat to provide 24-hour service. If you have any questions or needs during your stay, you can contact him. It feels very convenient. The staff in the concierge depar**ent are also very thoughtful, and they will answer all the questions about travel one by one. Herry took the initiative to leave a WeChat account, provided a lot of travel information, and helped to arrange a more economical and cost-effective vehicle. The location of the hotel is facing the sunrise, and you can see the sunrise lying in the room. The breakfast is very rich, meeting the various needs of men, women and children, and there are snacks from different places. The restaurant waiters Wu Handi and Chen Jinxiang are very considerate. The rich breakfast will give people a great sense of satisfaction and start a good day. There are three restaurants in the hotel, all of which have different functional positioning, can meet various needs, and the service is very good. Maybe I was too focused on eating, and when I commented, I realized that I didn't take photos of the food.

Facilities: The environmental facilities from the hotel room to other areas are unexpected. The hotel in 2016 is well maintained. Refer to the Amy next to it. It is older but the facility maintenance is better.

Hygiene: The rooms and public facilities are very clean, the swimming pool, beach and lawn are well maintained.

Location: The hotel is located in the core area of Shimei Bay in Wanning, facing Jiajing Island. It is very close to the most beautiful road and surfing in Riyue Bay. It is very close to the Shenzhou Peninsula. It is convenient for self-driving.

The two hotels in Shimei Bay have in-depth experience, and both feature a one-stop parent-child vacation style. Compared with the Westin Hotel, the scale is larger, the projects are more diversified, and it is more suitable for parents and children. The rooms and various facilities are better maintained, and the service is also good. More thoughtful and considerate, the food is also rich in variety, highly recommended!

msg:Because I brought pets and there were no people during the epidemic, the hotel upgraded me to a courtyard room on the first floor for free. A quick cleaning fee of 500 was charged. In a five-star hotel, the price is already very reasonable. Other hotels are calculated on a daily basis. The breakfast is also very rich and tastes good. The restaurant is also very good, there are several restaurants with different styles. There is a club on the beach of the hotel, where you can go out to sea to play projects, and you can have a barbecue by the sea at night. The price is also very fair. The beach club is in cooperation with the hotel. It is also because there are no people during the epidemic, and half price is charged at night. For 100 yuan per person, you can eat beach barbecue for free, and have seafood and snails caught by night fishing. I played with my mother for two days. The night view is very beautiful at night, and the club even took us to catch sand crabs and bake them, it was delicious. A very nostalgic trip.

First of all, due to the off-season when I checked in, I knew that it was my first time in Mannings, and I was directly upgraded to a sea view suite for free. The room is very large and is said to be the room where star Wu Qilong lived. Secondly, the hotel housekeeper Xiaona is very enthusiastic, the service is considerate and meticulous, and she also helped me to extend the check-out. Not to mention the free drinks from the minibar and welcome fruit, the courtesy is just in place. The last thing I have to say is the hotel's breakfast. I have stayed in so many five-star hotels in the country. The quality of this breakfast is definitely in the top three. The taste of ordinary grilled sausages is different from other hotels. In short, it is highly recommended. Westin is definitely one of the best hotels in Mannings. I will come again at the end of the year.

Before leaving, I once again experienced the warmth of a Westin. The housekeeper, Xiao Xu, was waiting for us at the front desk and presented the wedding anniversary gift on behalf of the hotel, wishing us harmony and beauty. The service of treating guests as friends really warms my heart.
When coming to Hainan in the future, Mannings Westin is definitely the first choice!

Although it was a little inconvenient to unblock it just now, the housekeeper Xiao Xu was very considerate and worked hard to help solve the problem~ He also gave fruit, food, red wine and souvenirs, which was very considerate and had a good experience.

The water quality of Shimei Bay is much better than that of Sanya, and the experience of staying in the Westin butler service has greatly improved the quality of the whole trip! The housekeeper Tingting contacted me the day before check-in, and then I consulted her throughout the four-day and three-night itinerary to arrange sea activities such as surfing, jungle paddle board, punching and glass water on Jing Island, snorkeling and so on! There are follow-ups for all activities‚úå! We didn't return until 12:00 when we went to sea, Tingting also helped us to check out late, and asked her for room supplies‚ò∫Ô∏èüëç!

Very caring! thank you very much! The breakfast at the hotel and the food in the restaurants were excellent. Downstairs is the beach, all kinds of water sports are complete, the price is not bad, not much more expensive than other places, the key is not to line up, there are few people on the beach, basically hotel guests!

msg:This time Emmy and Westin each stayed for 3 nights, let‚Äôs compare:
1. The overall environment: Le Meridien's lobby, square and open-air swimming pool are integrated into one, with a more classic design. The garden planning is also good, and the overall feeling is relatively soft; the lobby of Westin is relatively tough, and the garden is relatively simple.
2. Room: Because of the garden view, the sea view room on the highest 4th floor does not have a wide view of the sea; the sea view room of Westin is closer to the sea and has a wide view (the highest 6th floor is actually the 5th floor). Personally, I prefer the Westin room type, which feels more spacious, and the view and comfort of the balcony are better.
3. Service: Emmy's service is quite satisfactory, neither good nor bright, and I feel that I lack self-motivation. Westin's service feels more aggressive, with the attitude and actions of wanting to do better.
4. Breakfast: Westin's breakfast is richer, and it changes new tricks every day. The venue is large and spacious. The key point is that the foreman comes to ask if he is satisfied with the meal. This attitude is worthy of recognitionüëç
5. Activities: parent-child activities are relatively rich. Westin has a beach bar and an ice and fire show in the lobby.
Finally, I would like to give a thumbs up to Xiao Xu, the butler of Westin. The service is responsive. The most important thing is that after leaving the store, I didn‚Äôt ask for a good review. This is a clear stream at the moment. Only attentive service , Consumers will naturally give praise, why bother to ask for it legally.

Of the two hotels, Westin is better in personal evaluation.

This time I stayed at Amy Wannings and the Ritz-Carlton, Sanya
Really, there's nothing worse than staying at the Westin this time.

First: the ordered meals will not be accepted for two days, they will be placed at the door for cleaning, and they will not be accepted after cleaning. Is the door of this room attracting mosquitoes or what? ? I asked the housekeeper to pick it up, she said yes, but no one picked it up after a few hours. She said that maybe the waiter forgot.

Second: The long queue for breakfast is not to mention the huge black. The next floor of the hall is basically the basement. It is dark and full of people. The restaurants for villa and common room guests are also not divided. I spent 35,000 in this long line to grab something to eat? ? ? I also ate breakfast by the sea when I was in Emmy's more than 3,000 years. And the breakfast has less variety and taste is not good. It is the kind of cheap buffet. We didn't eat breakfast the next day, we couldn't eat it!

Fourth: There is no sea-view restaurant in such a big hotel, and several Chinese restaurants are all dark and depressing. Stayed here for two days and experienced nothing.

Fifth: The three-bedroom villa we live in has a room in the basement. Also dark and damp. Two of my friends slept in the basement room the second night and had a nigh**are! ! You can't call it a three bedroom villa. It is a two bedroom villa. No one is willing to spend money to live on the negative floor!

There is also no coffee on the second day, and so on, and other small problems are not mentioned. Basically no service. I feel like I spent 35,000 on a big lesson. Hey
! Really disappointed!

msg:The experience of staying at Westin this time is great, the hotel location and hardware are very good, the beach quality is very good, Shimei Bay private beach, the sand is fine and the water quality is good, suitable for surfingüèÑ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è, but the people are not like Riyue Bay Much, the water is very clear and blue, very nice. The hardware and hygiene of the hotel are great. I like that the Westin's terrace is big enough and comfortable. The decoration style of the whole room is soft and warm with wooden elements added. I would like to express my special thanks to the housekeeper Xiao Xu. This time it was quite unexpected. There was a dedicated housekeeper. It seems that there was no one-on-one care of the housekeeper when I stayed at the Westin Haitang Bay the year before. Helped us arrange the room, and also gave the children a gift of check-in. I can contact Xiao Xu if I have any questions during the period. She helps us patiently every time. The fruit once every two days during the stay is also very warm. Thank you very much. The younger brother of the swimming pool staff is also very good. Next time, I will consider staying at the Westin Shimei Bay. In addition to parents and children, it is also very suitable for conferences.
Service: great
Hygiene: great

The hotel can play some marine sports such as motor boats! The most important thing is to surf, lazy people are too lazy to go to Riyue Bay! ! ! I am very grateful to Miss Fu Tingting, the hotel steward, for arranging such a nice view room for us. We will be grateful if we have any needs. The breakfast is also very rich and will stay again (recommended for breakfast, seafood porridge, refreshing tonic and meat floss cake are delicious)

The spacious living room also gives the two children plenty of space for activities. Although I couldn't go to the beach due to the heavy rain on the first day due to the influence of the typhoon, the indoor swimming pool and playground made up for it, and everyone had a good time. The oil-splashed noodles and water-dipped noodles in the hotel's Chinese restaurant made my sister's family from Xi'an call the authentic ^^ butler Xiao Xu's service is even more meticulous, contact me to share the hotel and parent-child service information with me before check-in, and fall in the swimming pool The umbrella also helped me find it in time. Every day, I will send a fruit plate and a gift to the children. I am very satisfied with the stay experience. Next time I have the opportunity, I will stay for a few more nights~

At that time, Westin was chosen because the hotel not only has a good environment, but also has programs suitable for children under the age of three. Because our baby is two and a half years old, the projects in other hotels are played by people over 6 years old. Here, whether it is blue sky and white clouds, clear sea water, soft sandy beaches, exciting marine projects, or the starry sky at night, you can be satisfied here. Opposite the hotel is Jiajing Island, it is more convenient to live here if you plan to go. The other is the housekeeper. Each room has a designated housekeeper. Our housekeeper is named Xiao Xu, and the relevant matters have been arranged before we check in. If you have any needs during your stay, you can always ask the housekeeper for help, and there are fruits and cakes arranged by the housekeeper every day. All in all, it was a very good stay experience, and it made me feel that every penny was worth it.

The housekeeper, Xiao Xu, asked about my needs throughout the process, delivered a fruit plate, arranged for a late check-out, and sent a bag for wet clothes. Next time I come to Mannings, I will stay at Westin.

msg:The Westin in Wanning is so unforgettable, and the top five-star seaside hotel is one of the reasons why I fell in love with Wanning and Shimei Bay.
My housekeeper, Ms. Feng Fan, is a kind-hearted person. She helped me upgrade from a garden-view family two-bedroom suite to an ambassador two-bedroom suite. She also helped us apply for late check-out. The hotel also gave me a bottle of red wine and welcome fruitü•≠The service is invincible üòÅ
The hotel's Lobby is luxurious and luxurious. The lobby bar is facing the hotel's private beach. You can also see the Westin logo and punch in the holy place. There is a shop in the hotel that sells swimwear, sun protection clothing, sunscreen... It is very convenient.
Stroll on the hotel's private beach, step on the soft sand, blow the sea breeze all the way, and watch the locals fishing leisurely. You can also play exciting marine entertainment projects at the seaside, ride a motorboat in the sea, and go straight to the opposite Jiajing Island. In the evening, have a drink at the pink camping barbecue bar, smell the barbecue smell wafting from the back kitchen and the smell of the sea in the air, quietly enjoy the sound of the waves lapping the shore, and feel that the complicated world is instantly quiet.
Breakfast in the hotel in the morning, hearty food, steaming plates, outdoor table facing the sea, everything was perfect. Fill your stomach, go to the hotel's big lawn to find a travel photographer, and take beautiful photos as souvenirs. In the afternoon, go to the lobby bar to buy an afternoon tea for two people, eat exquisite cakes, and have a cup of hot milk. It is very comfortable.
The hotel has large indoor and outdoor swimming pools, as well as a gym with fitness equipment.
There is also a torch show at 8:00 p.m., brisk music, and superb performances, which add endless fun to the holiday.
The itinerary of the 3rd and 2nd night was fleeting, and it ended in a hurry before I had time to reminisce. The hotel arranged a free bus to take us to Wanning High-speed Railway Station. On the bus, I looked back reluctantly, thinking that I would choose this place for my next trip.

         In addition, let's talk about the balcony of the sea view room. The arc design is very comfortable. It looks small, but it is very warm and comfortable, and the privacy is better.
         The last thing I want to mention is the buffet breakfast. There are many varieties. The key is that the quality is good. The pastries are made to a high standard. In addition, the seafood noodles and raw porridge must be seasoned by themselves. Again, simply not too delicious! ! ! !

msg:Ctrip's score of 4.8 already represents the excellent quality of the hotel.
The first time I stayed, the hotel is located in the very beautiful Shimei Bay, which is full of a**osphere and privacy. Share a great beach with Le M√©ridien next door. Westin is more luxurious and Le M√©ridien is more private and luxurious.
The room booked a deluxe double room with sea view. The hotel lobby bar, garden lawn, and the sea view of Jiajing Island are unobstructed. The bathtub on the balcony is perfect for couples.
I think the hotel facilities are in line with Westin's positioning. The parking is convenient. The dining package is diverse. The breakfast is very rich and delicious. Coin-operated games for children are also good. Indoor swimming pool 50 meters standard Outdoor swimming pool Adults and children have their own characteristics.
But all of this can't actually be said to be a plus, but a standard configuration for a resort hotel at this price. What surprised me was actually the service of Westin. Except for the miscalculated meal delivery fee at checkout, all the service staff were strictly trained and friendly.
It is particularly worth mentioning that Miss Ellie from the Express Service Center (the last picture in the picture is her WeChat profile picture), who carefully asked the guests about their needs three days in advance, especially prepared a red wine cake for us, and the room was specially furnished. Not only that, she can be said to be my personal hotel housekeeper during my stay, whether it is the facilities in the hotel or a good place to play outside the hotel. We left the store and still applied for a 5% discount at the duty-free store for us. Like üëç for Miss Ellie.
Said so many advantages and said a little bit to look forward to better points:
Toiletries and terry bathrobes are of average quality. There is only paper pump in the bathroom in the room, which is a bit inconvenient. The refrigerator is almost room temperature, and there is not much to drink. The detail level can be done better.

Because Vicky Xiaoyun, the former guest relations director of Wannings from Haikou, added my wife's WeChat, very meticulous service, and knew our room requirements and approximate arrival time in advance, so the front desk can check in very quickly. Entered the room. Other guests in the room will have photos and descriptions, so I won't write more. Anyway, it is very Westin style. The design of the room and all the facilities are in the same vein as Westin. My wife especially likes the large bathtub and sofa on the balcony, with the slightly salty sea breeze, and really enjoy "facing the sea, spring flowers blooming"! The first thing we did after we arrived and put down our luggage was to have afternoon tea at the lobby bar, as well as our introduction to the nearby scenic spots during our stay, as well as recommendations for popular hotel activities, plus the exchange of daily consumables, as well as the Our license plate is notified to Mengang to facilitate our entry and exit. All of this is due to the dedicated service of Vicky Xiaoyun, the Director of Guest Relations. I would like to express my special thanks! My wife especially likes the pink girl on the beach, especially watching the sunset in the sunset, and the darkness around when the bonfire rises. Even if you don't drink, facing a glass of juice that you don't know, you can see the indescribable drink. It is full of romance and relaxation! I like Chinese restaurants for dinner very much. Every dish is full of color, flavor, and taste, which is completely comparable to that of a Michelin three-star restaurant! I feel that the only downside of the restaurant is that the air conditioner is not cool enough, it is too hot, and I have not stopped sweating from entering to finishing eating. I like the indoor swimming pool. It is a standard large-sized swimming pool for competitions. There is also an area on the side for small basin friends to play with. The design is very good! The lobby is facing the big lawn and the big beach. The small island in the sea not far away is quite a plus, and it is definitely the protagonist of every hotel guest's mobile phone.

Some hotels in Yalong Bay and Haitang Bay are also in use, but most of the hotels are too old, the experience is not good, and the service alone cannot support it. Shimei Bay has beautiful scenery, and Amy next door is also good, but I chose Westin in the end. I prefer the decoration style of Westin. It is ancient and modern, simple, a**ospheric and connotative. It is my dish.

msg:Shimei Bay is the best trip to Hainan this time. The originally planned Sanya itinerary, because of the bad weather after arriving, planned to play for another week, went to Lingshui, and finally arrived at Shimei Bay in Wanning.

I took the children for a run all the way, and the journey was a little tired. In fact, I chose Shimei Bay to enjoy the sun and the beach comfortably in the hotel. So I didn't choose a cheap homestay, and I didn't arrange any attractions, I directly chose the Westin Shimei Bay, which can take a leisurely vacation.

The day before, when people were still in Lingshui, the housekeeper mile called me and asked about the check-in situation, whether the room needed to be furnished, etc. Because there was no one‚Äôs birthday or anything, it was not arranged.


üöó Transportation: Take the bullet train from Lingshui to Shenzhou Station, 17 minutes. After getting off at Shenzhou Station, I called a car to the hotel for ten minutes. If the train is to Wanning Station, it is a little farther to the hotel.


üçÉEnvironment: After checking in at the hotel and staying in a sea view room, I have to say that the sea view is really amazing! Come to the Westin Shimei Bay, the sea here is the most beautiful, so be sure to live in a sea view room! The room is clean and tidy, and children's items are also prepared. There is a bathtub on the balcony of the room. Take a bubble bath in the bathtub at night, facing the sea, listening to the waves, and the cool sea breeze blowing, comfortable! There are several restaurants in the hotel, you can choose according to your taste.

With children, the parent-child activities at the Westin Shimei Bay are terrifyingly rich. But it is recommended that you do not check in on Mondays, the firework show is not open on Monday nights.

üîîService: I give 5 stars for the service of Shimei Bay Westin. Special thanks to the housekeeper mile, since I never checked in until I left the store, mile's service was the most comfortable experience in my trip. What makes me find it rare is that she is different from other hotel butlers I have stayed in. Others are polite, thoughtful and rigorous, but their responses are very official. Only mile seems to be a friend of yours. You can feel the account. Behind her is an optimistic and lovely girl. She will chat with you like a friend, and she will send you emoticons that young people like, which is playful and kind.

There was also a small episode when I stayed at Westin. I originally wanted to take my child to play in the heated swimming pool, but the water temperature was too cold, and I was asked to buy a swimming cap. I complained to mile for a while, but I didn't expect the other party to take it seriously. He gave me a feedback at the first time, and gave the child a cake and a small gift to apologize. The experience is up!

Let's talk about the sea in Shimei Bay. If you only talk about water, it is comparable to Yalong Bay, but there is no crowd of people in Yalong Bay. Only hotel guests can enjoy a beach. The sea is clean, no banana boats, no speedboats, and no salesmen around you. The sea in Shimei Bay is peaceful. Walking on the beach, finding a travel photographer, and taking a few beautiful photos is a worthwhile trip!

It's a pity that I stayed in Lingshui for several days, and I have no extra time to stay in Wanning, but Shimei Bay will not be a place to visit only once, and I look forward to our meeting again.

msg:It has been more than 10 years since the last time I came to Hainan. Due to the epidemic, I finally chose to come to Hainan for my honeymoon. After doing a lot of homework, I finally chose Westin in Wanning. Booked a hotel package for three days and two nights and was not disappointed! The most beautiful front desk is the Westin. The feeling of looking at the sea at a glance is very good. There is a Ting bar right in front of it. Here, you can have afternoon tea, sing in the evening, and engage in various activities, which are suitable for both adults and children. I stayed in a deluxe sea view king-bed room, room number 5005. The basic hotel lay flat for three days, plus the welcome fruits, SPA, candlelight dinner, travel photography and other items provided by the package, and continued to lie flat. I was a little unaccustomed to coming to Hainan, which led to gastroenteritis. The caring butler even gave me a large bowl of apples. The service was really thoughtful (name and praise the housekeeper Xiaolin~). The breakfast is in the Zhiwei Flagship Restaurant, which has a variety of varieties. For lunch, I chose the Taste Restaurant and ordered a two-person set menu, which is partial to Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai flavors. The next day, while the sun came out for a while, I went to the beach to take a group of photos, but it was a little bit sunbathing. Friends who come to Mannings, I personally think that Westin is the right choice. The only disadvantage is that the hotel is too big, so I have to stay for a few more days. I look forward to meeting you next time.

The management and service of the Marriott Group's chain hotels are as good as usual, and the stay is very comfortable. There are 24-hour dining especially for night owls. The beach coastline of the hotel is not particularly long, but it is expensive to clean up. At high tide, jellyfish, rays, and unknown deep-sea fish washed ashore. The butler service is also very considerate, and the various fruits sent are too late to eat. If I go to Wanning next time, I will continue to live there. It's a little pity that Marriott points can't be earned when placing an order on Ctrip

Staying in Dongyuan 8111 Villa Suite, the living room on the first floor is spacious and bright, there is a twin bedroom, and a cute towel elephant greets us. On the second floor, the master bedroom is huge, overlooking the sea, with a balcony bathtub. The second bedroom faces the swimming pool in the park and has a view of vegetation.
Walking out of the room, the fragrance of plants exudes, and walking through a quiet path is the beach... Delicate white sand, blue sea, laughing waves... Every morning I wake up, I can't wait to come to the beach to enjoy the beautiful scenery, and I don't want to give up at night. Sleep and immerse yourself in beach bars, bonfires, barbecues, resident singers... Bringing all the pleasant sounds together, it is not only a visual feast but also a relaxing resort.
Rich buffet breakfast, various children's games, and battery cars that are always available. In particular, I would like to praise vivky, the director of guest relations, who can give the most professional advice almost upon request. For example, a local friend from Wannings suddenly came to visit, and he quickly prepared a fruit platter for us, which is like home.
If we come to Mannings next time, we will still choose Westin.

It is really far to walk from the front desk to the room, and the signs are unclear. It is not easy to walk with two children to find the room. During the period, asking the aunt who is doing hygiene is just so casual. Checking out is even more annoying. The front desk made a mistake and asked me to make up for the lack of money when checking in. What does it mean that you have to queue up again for your work mistakes? Let's talk about the hotel restaurant, the portion is small and the taste is average, but the price is high and the price/performance ratio is low. In short, the overall experience is too bad.

First: The biggest selling point of the hotel is that it is pet friendly, but people with pets can only live on the first floor. It is not stated on Ctrip, which is extremely unreasonable! You must know that all dogs that can be taken out for travel will not urinate indiscriminately! Since you are branding as pet friendly, you should be as friendly as possible, otherwise, what will pet owners think of the additional 500 yuan cleaning fee? ? ? I advise you not to be truly pet friendly if you don't do it! !

Second: The check-in efficiency at the front desk is extremely low. When there are many people, please don't let novices on duty. The average speed is 10-15 minutes to complete one!

Third: Check out...this is what annoys me the most! I saw a lot of people queuing up, so I went to ask, do I have to queue for check-out? The girl at the front desk said: yes! I waited in line for more than 20 minutes, and suddenly a person who received the room card came from behind and said: No need to line up to check out! I wanted to scold people at the time...

After arriving at the Westin lobby, beach and room, the regret disappeared instantly. It's better than Ai.

It is convenient to play and eat. The hotel has its own management process which is quite satisfactory. For example, during the check-in process, the check-in speed was a bit slow and unskilled during the holidays and waited in the lobby for a long time. After protesting, someone immediately came out to coordinate the addition of a new check-in window, and the management staff Xing Jing ( I specially remembered the name, we should give recognition to those who work hard and have the energy) I quickly apologized and coordinated the arrangement, and also presented our hotel's afternoon tea and a set of lipstick samples, the afternoon tea's small Whether the dim sum is delicious or not, the quality needs to be improved. After check-in and during the check-in process, the customer service called me twice to ask if I was satisfied with the check-in experience. The butler Mille's WeChat was also added. The speed is a bit slow but the overall experience is not concealed. As long as there is a problem, it is a good management hotel to get timely feedback.

The little sister at the front desk watched us check in late, and offered to help us extend the check-out time and patiently introduced us. The room includes breakfast for one person. The single purchase is 128 yuan online. The waiter in the restaurant will help with the operation, which is very convenient. The travel photographer is also very good, taking pictures seriously, we also bought a package in addition to the 5 photos included in the room. I especially like the handsome boy Li from the concierge. When inquiring about looking for a car to go to Haitang Bay Duty Free Shop, he informed that there was a hotel to book a free car, but it was late at that time, so he kept contacting the car. Thank you very much! (Friendly reminder, if you need to make an appoin**ent to go to the duty-free shop or the airport, you must make an appoin**ent early, otherwise there will be no way if the space is not enough.) The environment and rooms are of normal standard, but for the service, I should come back again.

During the epidemic, there was no requirement to wear a mask to enter the restaurant to pick up meals. Westin in Haitang District did a good job at this point. The hotel as a whole is a large building complex. Indoor and outdoor swimming pools and amu*****t facilities are abundant. You can walk to the commercial street outside the hotel in ten minutes. There are supermarkets and dessert shops. Because they always dine in the hotel, they don‚Äôt pay attention to the surrounding areas. Restaurant. The hotel service of a chain brand is also very attentive. The housekeeper Xiaofeng called on the day before I checked in to ask about my preferences and requirements. On the day of check-in, he gave me a small gift and arranged welcome fruits and red wine, because I wanted to check in the night. When I went to a Chinese restaurant and contacted Xiao Feng to send wine to the Chinese restaurant, Xiao Feng specially applied for another bottle of red wine to help me deliver it to the restaurant. It was really considerate. During the stay in the hotel, we will arrange a car from the concierge to pick up and drop off the house. The housekeeper Xiao Feng is really a little girl who is not kind, and I will find her next time I stay.
Every time I visit Sanya, I will definitely stay at Westin in Shimei Bay, because it is really beautiful and beautiful, and this sea will make people feel peaceful.

msg:During my honeymoon with my husband, I chose to drive to Hainan by car because I was bringing a dog. Originally, Hainan‚Äôs travel plan was Haikou-Wanning-Sanya. The most difficult thing to travel with a dog was the choice of hotels. I didn‚Äôt expect Wanningweisi Ting can actually bring a dog to stay. After consulting the related issues of bringing a dog in, Wanning all stayed at Westin for four days. After staying in, both her husband and I felt very good, because they bring their own beach, and they can also bring them at sunset. Go to the dog and go for a stroll on the beach. You can go on the first floor and outdoor public venues. You have to pull the leash for the dog. The gym pool is a place that my husband is very satisfied with. They are all his favorites. In the middle, I went to Sanya. After I came back, my husband and I decided to cancel the Sanya hotel and continue to stay at Westin to continue the perfect vacation trip. I played the Delta Wing that I had never dared to play, but I didn‚Äôt expect it to be very cool. Hahaha! Finally, I would like to thank the hotel butler, Xiao Lin, for taking care of me these days. If you have anything to do, I will send you a WeChat message. Xiao Lin always gives us feedback and handling in time. Thanks to Westin for giving us a perfect honeymoon trip! Hope to have a chance to come on vacation again!

msg:To be honest, Wanning is better than Sanya whether it is a vacation or a parent-child trip!
On the one hand, the hotel is cheaper than Sanya. The Westin experience is good. Although the weather was not particularly good for the three days I went to, there were showers every day. But it did not affect the play. Unfortunately, I did not participate in the hotel‚Äôs parent-child activities. Next time, I must go to the housekeeper. Xiao Li's service is particularly good. I added WeChat in advance and called me to ask if there are any requirements for the room. I also specifically asked if there are children or the elderly who are not very caring. It is very convenient to contact WeChat at any time. It's not expensive. It's hard to find a word from the public comment. . All in all, the experience is very good. The breakfast is very salty because of the seafood porridge to the waiter. I didn‚Äôt expect the waiter in the restaurant to call out to the chef to apologize. It‚Äôs totally unnecessary. The chef also told me that a few customers were salty. I responded positively and quickly apologized. The service attitude is very good. Whether it is cleaning aunt, housekeeper or indoor swimming pool, the attitude of the staff is very good. I like the constant temperature of the indoor swimming pool. There are also free swimming rings. You don‚Äôt need to remember to wear a swimming cap. It costs 20 yuan to buy it there. Both adults and children need it. Today I exchanged it for the InterContinental Hotel in Haitang Bay, Sanya, to be honest. . . Really inferior to Wanning.........not good in all aspects, right. . Wanning Westin Beach is particularly good. The hotel is only two minutes away. There are few people and cleaner. Don't come to Sanya next time!

msg:I wanted to avoid the Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day for a clean vacation, but it happened that the hotel was hosting a plastic surgery hospital for a week. All the beautiful scenery was covered by the three ugly stages of the hospital, and the lawn and beach were not visible. By the way, afternoon tea can only be staring at the stage in a daze. There are very noisy activities during the day and night, which can be heard in the swimming pool. In this case, shouldn't the hotel inform consumers in advance and adjust the room rate appropriately? Is one thousand and three bought to suffer every night?
The breakfast is also very ordinary, I don‚Äôt know if Wanning‚Äôs supplies are lacking, and there are not many dishes to choose from, which is similar to the holiday inn, but the location is relatively large. And because of the event, no matter what time I went, I was robbed of the residue and didn't replenish it in time. The experience was very poor.
But the attitude of the service staff is very good, the cleaning aunt and the swimming pool staff seem to be in a good mood and infect people, other places are very ordinary.

This time, because I brought my child to my birthday, I specially booked a pool room. The butler Xiaofeng contacted me in advance and arranged a good room type for me. When the door was opened, the slide in the children‚Äôs pool was directly prepared. The cake is so delicious!
Xiaoyun from the concierge depar**ent also requested a bottle of red wine for me to deliver the luggage to the room, so sweet!
There is also a children‚Äôs club in the hotel, where you can book a hosting service in advance to free your parents' hands. It‚Äôs great!
The child is having fun, and is reluctant to think about it! Coming again next year!

msg:Facts have proved that, especially when a person comes out to play, whether living well or not will greatly affect the travel experience. This hotel is highly recommended to stay when you come to Wanning. If you are traveling with 2-3 people, it is more cost-effective for couples or friends to come out to play.

üöó Transportation: Didi is very convenient in Shimei Bay in Wanning. It is a good choice to go anywhere. And the hotel also has a pick-up service, you can communicate with the hotel in advance.

üçÉEnvironment: 100 points for the environment! The hotel is under the name of Marriott, you can use the official website to book, maybe there is a discount, the quality of the air and the smell of the bed space are OK, there is no awkward place to live.
Most importantly, this hotel has the best sandy beach here, and it is only 10 minutes away by motorboat from Kajing Island. In the morning, you can get up to watch the sunrise, and then take a beach bike or Didi to go to Jiuli Beach (this section is the most beautiful, I promised to go).
It‚Äôs not too far to go to Riyue Bay and Xinglong. You can go shopping after playing these water sports on the island. Go to Xinglong in the evening to eat delicious food. Go to Riyue Bay for a drink and then come back to rest in the evening.

üîîService: The service is superb. There were some minor problems when I checked in, but Xiao Zhao and Xiao Fang, who received me at the time, helped me deal with each of them. The overall experience is superb.
 If you want to play water sports, you can ask at the hotel‚Äôs fitness center, or ask those who drive motorcycles at the beach. It‚Äôs very convenient to go out here and it‚Äôs close to the island, and the Internet celebrity projects are more convenient to play. There are also surfing here, but not as many as Riyuewan.

One day before check-in, Lily, the duty manager of the front office, called to ask about the room type or requirements. Because it was the gold card, the sea-view room was arranged directly. At the beginning, the requirements for free upgrades were not too high, and the check-in procedures were completed. Look out the window, absolutely! The first line of sea view, it is a high floor, in addition, I also gave me a typhoon weather warning on WeChat and answered various other questions, thank you Lily~

The concierge Xiaobin was very enthusiastic to take the luggage for us and gave us welcome fruits. If you have any questions, you can quickly reply to us on WeChat. Very good~

During the check-in process, the duty manager Ye Lei also called to ask about the check-in experience and check-out time, etc. I also thank her for her service~

All in all, I am very satisfied with Westin this time. It is very close to the beach. The lobby is simple and simple, and the breakfast is also very rich. It is suitable for bringing a family of young and old to vacation. There are not as many people in Sanya.

Thank you Lily and Icy for your attention during their stay, and I will recommend family and friends to come together in the future.

msg:There is a sea view, and the entrance of the hotel is a beach. The vacation is really comfortable. The sea breeze blows in the moment you enter the lobby. The open lobby really feels like a seaside. The breakfast at Marriott's hotels is nothing to say, it's very hearty. The Ting Bar is also a good place to spend the afternoon sun, and the cocktails are very special.
It is worth mentioning that the service of Adam Li, the butler, is really in place. You can get in touch by phone before you travel to understand our itinerary, arrange services and rooms according to our needs in advance, and also specially deliver us welcome fruits and various hotel services. You can also book through the butler, which is really considerate and convenient.
Next time you come to Wanning for a vacation, we must first choose westin.

Call me one day in advance, upgrade my room type for free, and also give me welcome fruits. Later, there was a little episode, and I gave me a bottle of red wine üç∑ plus a bake cake üç∞. When I left the hotel, I took a car to the Le M√©ridien Hotel, and notified Le M√©ridien to send a car to pick me up. The service was so attentive. I thought about the guests wholeheartedly. I suggest that the hotel must give Lin Xiaoxue an excellent employee award. !

The butler, Xiao Lin, was very considerate. He asked about the check-in requirements in advance and asked the room service to deliver fruits!
Compared with the Southeast Asian style of Le M√©ridien next door, Westin is more modern. The hotel lobby is magnificent, facing Kajing Island on the opposite side. The hotel area is very large, if you walk to the hotel lobby in the rooms on the two wings, it will be remote.
The water temperature of the hotel's indoor swimming pool is a bit low, unlike other hotels that are warm. There are landscape seats outside the hotel‚Äôs breakfast room. Looking at Kajing Island, it‚Äôs nice to have breakfast!

The butler of the hotel, Xiao Feng, is very nice. I requested to arrange the room in advance and check in at the hotel. The front desk may be to let me check in as soon as possible. The butler took the initiative to contact me and changed the room. The attitude is very good. Haha is really a bonus
Hotel facilities are older than expected, shampoo products are very dry
The hotel environment is okay. There are quite a few places to take pictures on the beach, lawn and beach
The restaurants in the hotel are quite expensive, but it doesn‚Äôt matter if you can order takeout. I personally feel that Wanning has nothing to eat. There is no need to spend time and money on eating (don‚Äôt ask me why üò¢)

You must bring your ID card. It is good to find the housekeeper Xiaofeng one day in advance for sea activities and other activities. The room has been upgraded facing the sea. I am very happy.

A small indoor playground, an indoor swimming pool, and an outdoor swimming pool (there are not many rides in some swimming pools). In the case of price increases, the overall price is not high. If you want to play other things, you have to pay. Compared to R&F Marriott, Westin's price/performance ratio is too low.
In addition, I am very grateful to the butler Xiao Li for his five-star service üëç for helping with late check-out and booking parent-child activities.

msg:I took my parents and two babies out to play. In the two choices of Amy and Westin, Westin chose Westin because of his two-destination ocean view room. The housekeeper, Xiao Li, called and asked us what we needed special the day before we checked in. He learned that we had a child of two to three months and seven years old. He prepared bathrobes and toiletries and welcome fruits for the child, which was very considerate. We asked Xiao Li on WeChat and Xiao Li would reply in seconds. Finally, we found the baby's waist stool on the way to the airport and sent it to Xiao Li via WeChat. Xiao Li immediately helped us find the sea and mailed it to us. Full marks butler. The only shortcoming is the breakfast in the morning. The location is tight and the restaurant service cannot keep up. The children are not charged according to their height and weight, but according to their age. The key is that they have to line up in the breakfast room in the morning. The waiters who are already popular are not put in. It's really not worth one hundred and eighty.
