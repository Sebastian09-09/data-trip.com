Price is high and hotel staff doesn’t speak any English, which made it difficult for us to understand what was on offer. They were very responsive on wechat though. We recommend this hotel if you’re staying in Mingshi.

msg:The hotel was clean and modern, and every single room has a view of the surrounding karst mountains. The view from the pool is to die for. 

The food in the restaurant was pretty good, if a bit overpriced. It would be lovely if they also had an English menu, but that's rare in this corner of China, and we managed with rudimentary Chinese and pointing. 

Be aware that the hotel is in the middle of nowhere. Other than a small convenience store, there's nothing around. You need a car, scooter or bike to get around.

If I had any complaints, it would be that the rooms aren't very well insulated for sound. We could hear everyone who walked up or down the staircase.

We felt taken care of and they arranged a driver to pick us up at the airport. They greeted us with smiles, the housekeeper left fruits and a nice hand written note, and the front desk did their best to make our stay a comfortable one. We were traveling with our toddler and the food options were delicious and affordable. We want to say thank you to Chen Kai for going out of his way to make us feel special and welcomed. He speaks English and made many great suggestions regarding travel, activities, and calling the hospitals to see where we could get our nucleic test. The space is surrounded my mountains and it’s green everywhere you look. You can take a boat ride along the river located just in front of the property. Currently there is construction on one side, they are expanding the facilities. The whole space is nice as worth a visit. We didn’t give a 5 for amenities because we felt it could have catered more to families.

msg:I traveled to Chongzuo with my parents and children, and the first stop was Mingshi Tianyuan. It was really the wisest choice to choose to stay here. Special thanks to Xiaozhen, Xiaoli, and Xiaowei.

1. The hotel is very large, with a restaurant, gym, laundry room, and swimming pool. It didn't feel crowded at all during the May Day holiday, and the experience was very good. The room is also very simple and clean, and the large floor-to-ceiling glass has a panoramic view of Chongzuo.

2. The best impression of the hotel is the service. The service staff will always provide services with a smile on their faces at the first time. I feel that the hotel is well staffed, and I don't feel overwhelmed even on holidays.

3. I like the hotel lobby very much, and tea and exquisite afternoon tea are always provided. I have to praise the hotel's breakfast, which has many varieties and is very delicate and tastes very good. I also experienced the hotel barbecue bar last night, accompanied by live singing, which was quite a feeling.

Next time if I come to Chongzuo, I will definitely come again, and I will also recommend my friends around me! I hope the store will continue to work hard~

As soon as you leave the community, you will see the cycling signs and routes. Riding in the morning is refreshing. The scenery is picturesque and I like it very much. However, although the mountain and water cycling trails of Mingshi Tianyuan have been carefully designed and maintained, they were cut off near Mingshi Villa, and a complete closed loop was not formed. I had to return the same way. This also affects the mood of tourists. It can only be said that the mentality of *** separatism still exists. It is particularly worth mentioning that the breakfast provided by the hotel there is very good, which is similar to that of a five-star hotel in a big city, which brought us a surprise before leaving. In addition, the hotel provides free shooting services for ethnic costumes, which promotes the folk culture of Guangxi and makes Xiaobingjie have a lot of fun.

In the afternoon, I took advantage of the sunny day to ride near the hotel and visited the fish scale dam and the scenery between the fields. At night, I enjoyed barbecue and beer at the Earth Restaurant, watching the poetic mountain scenery reflected on the surface of the rice paddy water under the lights. The housekeepers Xiao Li, Xiao Zhen and Xiao Wei greeted me warmly and were very friendly, which deserves praise! ! ! I stayed on the third floor of the Pillow Field Bed. The large glass design and semi-outdoor seats allowed me, who usually skipped breakfast due to work, to enjoy a rare 2-hour leisurely slow food time. The courtyards and plants are all over the hotel, attracting birds and insects as well as dragonflies with fiery red bodies. In short, everything is so beautiful, satisfying my yearning for Chongzuo and my expectation of relaxing my body, mind and soul on this trip.

The hotel environment is pretty good, the scenery of Mingshi Tianyuan is pretty beautiful, and the hotel's free bicycles are very good, you can ride around. Of course, because it is surrounded by rice fields, there will be more mosquitoes, so you have to pay attention.
If there are any shortcomings, one is that the bed is a bit too soft and the mattress will move, and the other is that the booking form says there is fruit upon check-in, but it was not actually delivered.

The service staff was very enthusiastic, the restaurant decoration and dining environment were very good, and the variety was also OK. The hotel decoration and design were very good. Every shot was very good. The hotel also has a vegetable garden hahaha. Did they grow it for the restaurant themselves? It's a pity that I can only try it next time. Oh, by the way, the only flaw is that our 270-degree king-size bed room on the first floor this time has a dark, damp and smelly smell. I hope it can be improved!

Because of the itinerary, I was exhausted after a day of playing from Fusui Longgu Bay. It took nearly 2 hours to drive here. It was already 5 pm when I arrived here to check in. The attitude of the service staff was very good and considerate. When they came, they took the children to eat fruits and cookies and other tea breaks. After we checked in, we went straight to the community Chinese restaurant opposite and enjoyed a beautiful dinner. It was delicious, very delicious. The environment there is very good. It’s just the end of March, it’s the rice planting stage, and it hasn’t grown up yet, but it will be very beautiful if you come later, and the night view is also beautiful. Due to the formation of the reason, I only stayed for one night and didn’t have a good look around the surrounding scenery, but the breakfast buffet the next day was very rich, and I checked out very early. Thanks to Xiao He and Xiao Lu, the service is very good. Before leaving, they also took the favorite cookies for the little baby and gave them handmade brown sugar as a souvenir. If possible, I would like to continue to stay😄

msg:Let me talk about the advantages first: First of all, I am very grateful to the front desk lady for upgrading the room type, which made up for the small regret of not taking photos. When I left, I was given brown sugar ginger tea. Thank you very much! There is an unlimited supply of fruit snacks and tea at the front desk. You can also ride bicycles for free. Then the environment in the whole community is very good. The flowers, plants and trees are very attentive. There is also a Huawei speaker in the room. This is the first hotel with a speaker that I have encountered in the past few days in Guangxi. It is super good. There is no TV for us. The breakfast is delicious! The variety is very rich! There is also oil tea! Snail noodles! The coffee is also delicious! The scenery is also invincible!!!
Let me talk about a small regret: Naba Restaurant only has hot pot for dinner. My mother and I think that hot pot will not be bad no matter how much we eat, so we decided to eat here. But... the serving speed is very slow. The overall taste of the hot pot is also average... It can be said that it is the worst hot pot I have ever eaten... The cost performance is very low, and the portion for two is too inappropriate. There is no mutton or beef, only chicken and meatballs, duck blood, bean puffs, duck feet, and vegetables. There are a lot of leftovers, and I force myself to eat...

msg:Following the Ctrip navigation, we arrived near the hotel area, but we couldn't find the hotel. After going back and forth several times, we finally found the door and asked for directions to the front desk. There was only one female employee at the front desk. When I asked her who would take the luggage to the room, she said: I will! (To be honest, she was very responsible) Later, a security guard was brought to help, but the luggage had not been unloaded, and the security guard was busy... and ran away! The next day, we had to run a long way to check out and return the card! What's more annoying is that when we checked out at around 9 o'clock, we encountered workers disinfecting insects, which made the three of us have nose allergies. From the feeling of staying in the hotel, the environment is still beautiful and pastoral, but it is still a long way from the real hotel management. We should work hard to improve it.

It is also very convenient to drive to Detian Waterfall and Donna Island Bay by yourself the next day. It is right in the middle of the two major attractions, and there are also shuttle buses available.

msg:It’s not that you can’t afford to live in Chongzuo Lishi, but it’s more cost-effective “there”!

Environment: The hotel focuses on the concept of "community". It is built against the mountain, facing the Mingshi River, and built in the rice fields. The courtyard-style layout is very original, the outdoor infinity swimming pool is very popular, and the food is also excellent. Most of the vegetables and rice are grown by the hotel itself. The rice is especially fragrant, so you must try it;


Service: We stayed for two days. It rained all the way and the weather was slightly cool when we checked in on the first day. Our housekeeper Xiao Lu and the front desk Xiao Huang were very busy, helping us carry our luggage and help us prepare. I ordered delicious brown sugar ginger tea to ward off the cold. It was really considerate. At the same time, he also explained the cycling route of Mingshi Pastoral in detail, introduced the various functional areas of the hotel, and finally helped us return our luggage to the room. , it can be seen that the hotel staff are still very professional in terms of service. The service level is not inferior to that of a five-star hotel. Real-name praise. I hope the boss will add chicken drumsticks to the two ladies! In addition, the hotel can also rent bicycles for free. There are ordinary bicycles (which look better when taking pictures) and mountain bikes to choose from. The other butlers are also very good and their services are excellent!

Finally, here are some real-life scenery pictures of the hotel for your reference~

msg:This is the first time I came to Chongzuo with my family. I was looking forward to the Mingshi Pastoral Scenic Area and chose the Daxin Mingshi Nali Hotel in the scenic area. It really surprised me. When checking in, the front desk staff arranged us on the first floor. It was a surprise to see the room. It seemed like living in the countryside and getting in close contact with the countryside. The design of the room is very comfortable. The lighting and ventilation are excellent, the size is suitable, and it is spacious and comfortable. The balcony is the most satisfactory. It is very comfortable and cozy to drink tea, enjoy the countryside and watch the sunset.
The service of the hotel is very thoughtful and warm. We went from the tourist center to the hotel and left the hotel to the tourist center. The hotel met our pick-up requirements; we wanted to take a sightseeing bus to visit the entire scenic area, and they helped us call the sightseeing bus to pick us up. The hotel has bicycles for free. In short, our sightseeing needs there were met.
In terms of catering, the breakfast dining environment is very good, the food is rich and the taste is good. Dinner is in the hotel's Chinese restaurant. The dishes are delicious, the dishes are served quickly and the portions are large. Satisfied. In addition, the hotel also has a lobby lounge, which provides free tea, fruit, etc. At the same time, the welcome fruit was delivered to the room on time and of good quality.
It was not convenient to take a Didi taxi for transportation, so when we went out to play, the hotel recommended the contact number of a reliable driver for us. The driver was also punctual and honest.
In short, we had a wonderful and relaxing time in the hotel.

In the afternoon, I took advantage of the sunny weather to ride a bicycle near the hotel, visiting the Yulin Dam and the scenery in the fields just a short distance away. At night, we enjoyed barbecue and drank beer at Dadi Restaurant, watching the picturesque mountain scenery reflected on the water of the rice after the lights were turned on.

The housekeepers Xiaolan, Xiaoli and Xiaowei greeted us cordially and asked us how we felt after returning from a day out. The excellent service provided by the restaurant staff and the professionalism shown by being one step ahead in everything shows that the hotel owner puts the service concept first.

The all-day dining restaurant has a variety of breakfast options and has designed different dish selections on both days. Bread and fruits are made/cut into small portions, allowing people to choose the quantity with peace of mind without wasting food. The large glass design and semi-outdoor seating allowed me, who was usually busy with work and skipped breakfast, to enjoy a rare 2 hours of leisurely slow food time.

Courtyards and plants are scattered all over the hotel, attracting the chirping of birds and insects and dragonflies with flaming red bodies.

In short, everything was so beautiful, which satisfied my longing for Chongzuo and my expectation of relaxing my soul during this trip.

The hotel is an area with its own pastoral scenery. The hotel front desk, breakfast room, bar, and swimming pool are all part of a courtyard. The guest rooms, Chinese restaurant, and gym are other courtyards. Tall phoenix-tailed bamboos, green bamboos, stone paths, white walls and ink painting-like scenery are harmonious and beautiful.

Rich breakfast and attentive service. Moreover, it is only a 30-minute drive from Detian Waterfall and very close to scenic spots such as Yulin Dam and Mingshi Pastoral. It only takes 10 minutes by electric car. One step at a time, there are several different cycling roads. The scenery is very beautiful and a paradise. Very cost-effective, highly recommended.

Conventional hotels have to notify guests around 9:50 to collect food, and the kitchen collects food on time at 10 o'clock. But not here. They are very humane. When they see some guests arriving late, they will take the initiative to replenish the dishes. It is not until 10:10 that someone comes to remind the guests that their meals are about to be collected, so that the guests can have breakfast in peace.

We stayed for two nights and had to go to the hotel for many things, from asking about attractions, transportation arrangements, to printing out children's learning materials. Our colleagues at the front desk of the hotel were very patient in helping us solve the problem. Special praise goes to Xiaoli and Xiaoli. Your service was attentive, meticulous and extremely patient! There was also a man at the front desk. We asked for some sugar cane in the scenic area because we didn’t have a knife, so we asked the front desk to help cut off the skin. Although in the end we couldn’t do it because we didn’t have a suitable knife, the boy patiently helped us contact the kitchen and finally cut it into pieces. Little by little.

Thank you to the hotel there and I look forward to experiencing it again next time!

msg:When I came to Mingshi in winter, it was cold but there were few people. Although I didn't see the green and golden wheat fields, the cold mountains also had a unique flavor. The hotel is not facing the street and is relatively secluded. There is a small field where vegetables are grown between the accommodation building and the lobby. The lobby faces a rice field and has an idyllic scenery. The room I stayed in was on the third floor. The entire floor-to-ceiling window looked out at a quiet river and the opposite side was the mountain. There was no TV in the room. It was very peaceful to sit on the tatami by the window and drink tea. I rented a hotel bike and rode around, enjoying the beautiful scenery. The service staff are very enthusiastic. They are more enthusiastic than those encountered in other places in Guangxi. I commend @小丽@小伟@小兰 and will come again if I have the opportunity.

The air is fresh, the hotel has three places to eat, and the environment is very romantic. There are rice seedlings in the fields right outside your door, and you can come out in the morning to breathe fresh air. It is very close to Detian Waterfall by car, less than half an hour.
Special thanks to Xiaoli and Xiaozhen for their service, as well as the Chongqing girl, the foreman, who is kind and kind. Before leaving, I gave him ginger tea and an umbrella.

msg:The hotel parking lot there is relatively large and organized. There are two parking places for large cars and small cars, making parking convenient. The entrance looks like a small farm, with red spring characters hanging full of Spring Festival elements, echoing the vegetable garden in front of the door, creating an a**osphere. The front hall is not big after entering the door. There is a tea break area when you walk in. From 2 to 5 o'clock, free fruits, biscuits, small cakes and red ginger tea are provided, which is very heartwarming. The most eye-catching thing when entering is the water-viewing platform of the western restaurant. The scenery is beautiful. The floor-to-ceiling windows in the entire western restaurant (breakfast area) allow the beautiful scenery to be water-tight. I just arrived and sat down and ordered a latte for 28 yuan. The coffee beans were average. . We were given the mountain view room in the classic picture on the third floor. The room basically matches the picture. I think it is even better than the picture. The shower and toilet are separated, and there is a dressing table next to the shower. This is very good and is especially convenient for women. , there is a sink next to the toilet, I personally like this design. The balcony of the room has a great view. It faces the same direction as the viewing platform of the western restaurant, with mountains, water and rice fields. Open the door and look at the swimming pool, and the two views coexist. The only small problem with the room is that if the temperature is around 25 degrees during the day, even if the balcony door and window are open, the room will still be hot and stuffy because there is no cold air conditioning in winter. At night, the room temperature is very comfortable and there is no need for hot air conditioning. Anyway, there is no need for hot air conditioning. No air conditioning in winter. I really like the smell of the hand sanitizer there. The floral fragrance of the pearl flowers makes me wash my hands constantly. Dinner at the hotel was our first meal, and I felt it was quite satisfactory. The roast chicken and duck mentioned online were delicious, but they were average. The only thing I remembered was the asparagus. The price of the vegetables is not cheap, especially the vegetables at 48 yuan a serving. High, the hotel gives guests a 10% discount on dinner (excluding drinks). I would especially recommend the hotel’s buffet breakfast. It’s really remarkable and exquisite. Everything is good (the best thing I’ve ever eaten). The longan is really sweet, the hazelnut crisp Yummy, not to mention rice noodles, and bread. Great, I think it’s worth the 68 yuan for extra breakfast. The hotel can rent bicycles for free. If you want to borrow Snoopy or a moped, you can ask the front desk for the rental number, but it is not the hotel's. The hotel also sets off fireworks at night on weekends, which are beautiful and an absolute value-added service. The experience of staying here this time was very good, and the service was also very good. It was a pity that for the second dinner, we ordered the group purchase dishes reviewed by Dianping and a la carte dishes. After the two a la carte dishes were served, we waited for 35 minutes and the group purchase dishes were not served. The dishes were all served to the subsequent guests. Maybe I was too busy today. This meal made me a little disappointed and affected my performance at dinner. But the service there is still very good. Any feedback will be resolved promptly and the attitude is sincere. After staying for two days and checking out, the hotel called to say that they found a small ring left behind by the child (a cheap gadget bought online). The child searched for it for a long time and couldn't find it. Although we didn't ask the hotel to send it back later, this reflected that the hotel was very clean. carefulness. I hope that the hotel will continue its efforts and achieve greater success in the future.

If you can't navigate to Yulinba and don't know the direction yourself, you can reserve a battery car in the scenic spot, 35 yuan per person, and browse around on the main road of the scenic spot to see a panoramic view.
The hotel has an outdoor swimming pool, which is open from 9 am to 9 pm.
The hotel restaurant has Chinese food and Western food. We have eaten Chinese food, and because we are not addicted to spicy food, we feel that the dishes we ordered taste delicious. Occasionally, if you want to change your taste, you can order the "Half Cup of Milk Tea Snacks" for takeout, including barbecue and fruit tea, all of which are delicious.
The hotel has complete facilities, including body lotion and makeup mirror. Then I carefully designed the dressing table + no TV, which is very suitable for children to stop watching TV and do their homework! Hahaha.
It is said that the hotel specially rented land around it to plant rice for guests to watch, so we sat indoors and saw green rice fields, farmers working in the fields, white birds shuttled between the fields to catch fish, butterflies dancing, and mountains in the distance , misty...
All in all, it was a wonderful stay experience👍

You must ride one lap of the cycling greenway in Mingshi Pastoral, otherwise you will miss 100 million. Special praise for the service of this hotel, the feeling of being at home, especially the Western restaurant, which even gave me a cake for my birthday.

The breakfast area is also surrounded by rice fields and has a swimming pool. The service is very good, timely and in place. Although there is nothing much to see in Mingshi Garden itself, there are many places worth visiting in the surrounding area. There are very few people in Anping Xianhe. We chartered a boat and drove for an hour. It was so beautiful and pleasant. The Dragon Palace Wonderland Cave is also very shocking. The key is that it is really lucky to have such a tourist attraction with so few people on November 1. The Detian Waterfall I went to later was not as pleasant. All in all, I recommend this hotel, I love it.

Service: Special praise to Xiaoli and Xiaolan at the front desk.

When we got to the room, they introduced the room facilities and warmly reminded us about the room temperature. 26 degrees is suitable, very professional. The room is large and the design is very reasonable. My mother praised it and said it was much better than Qingpu Yunlu in Yangshuo. The canteen there tastes good, and the green bamboo fish found in the local red lake water😀. I love the breakfast restaurant so much. The designer gave it full marks. It is the best breakfast restaurant in any hotel I have ever stayed in. I will definitely go to Mingshi again if I have the chance, a place that will make people remember it.

msg:To be honest, this is the first time I have written a negative review. I have been using Ctrip for so many years. It is the first time I have encountered such a deceptive hotel. How can I stay in such a bad room for 1,600? After reading the negative reviews, it turns out that I am not the only one who was deceived by the boss's ugly appearance! How dare you price a room like this at 1,600? It turns out this is a hotel that doesn’t care about bad reviews.
There are already customers who have made such negative reviews. If you have to repeat the same reviews written by a bunch of people, you can only say that the boss is crazy for money! ! !

The room was full that day. After my communication with the front desk failed, I silently endured this extremely low cost-effective room. There was no balcony, the toilet was sealed and light-proof, and the room was extremely small. The whole feeling was depressing! I looked at the room in 1100 which is 10 times better than this one (unfortunately I only saw it the next day)

I don't understand the advantages of this hotel. The service staff are all good (I don't want to make any service staff feel wronged, but with this price, the owner must be crazy about money). Such a hotel is simply a slap in the face of Mingshi Pastoral. consider carefully!

The supporting facilities are quite complete. There is no peculiar smell and there are not many mosquitoes in the countryside. It is a little surprising
But after checking in, I feel that the hardware is really not good
In the room on the first floor, the glass of the window is not soundproof
When I go to bed at night, I will be disturbed by the frogs in the field so that I cannot fall asleep
The sound of running and jumping upstairs can be heard clearly, and the sound of bath water feels very thin between floors
The room is filled with a damp smell, and the aromatherapy is useless
The air conditioner was very loud and had to be turned off in the end. Fortunately, the mountains are still cool after nightfall
The bed frame squeaks and the mattress feels average
On the night of check-in, there was a power outage, and it was restarted ten minutes later
On the morning of the third day of stay, the power went out again 😅
It's really the price of a resort hotel, the quality of an ordinary homestay
But the service is really good
Hotel staff is nice
I need a birthday cake that day, but I can’t find it nearby
I asked the front desk at 6 o'clock. The front desk asked the kitchen to help me make it now. I got it at 9 o'clock. The ingredients are still good. Fresh fruit and animal cream are good. Give the service staff a good review👍

msg:The lowest value for money hotel I stayed in for a month of self-driving trip. It is really not worth the price. First of all, the view of the room arranged by the hotel was blocked by a tree, and the rice field had just been planted, but it was actually just a piece of mud. There was nothing to talk about. Landscape, so don’t choose the Love Field series. The landscape of this building is very average, and adding a tree will really ruin your enjoyment. But no matter how bad the view is, it can't be compared to its service. The so-called service is all about face and not sincere. Especially Zheng Lan, the person in charge of the western restaurant, ignored everyone throughout the whole process. Even after breakfast, no one checked the room card. No, let alone arranging seats. When we saw a table by the window, we asked our son to sit there first, and then called the waiter to collect the meal. Zheng Lan ignored him the whole time. Later, after playing and yelling at the waiter, she She asked my son to sit next to her first, and she asked her to clean it up before we sat here. Her attitude was always bad, so we did so. When I came back from picking up the meal, I found that the meal had already been placed in the seat, and I couldn't see it the whole time. Any service staff had no choice but to communicate to the other party that this place belonged to us. Fortunately, the other party understood, but at this time I was already very annoyed and ignored people throughout the process. After repeatedly forbearing, they did not even leave a seat for me. At this time, she He actually explained that he didn’t want me to sit in that seat because there were a lot of flies there. I really laughed. Isn’t this restaurant connected to China Unicom? And she said that there were a lot of flies in restaurants at this price, didn't she feel sorry for it? As the person in charge, she never solves any problems and keeps creating them. Immediately afterwards, she did some things that made other guests very angry and angry, which I won’t go into details if they have nothing to do with me. Later, the person in charge of the restaurant sent rice and apologized after I complained, but it could not change my evaluation of this hotel. There were cobwebs in the room, stains on the bath towels, and the view was blocked. When I reported these problems to the housekeeper, I just said I was really sorry in a very perfunctory tone, and nothing else. I didn’t see anything about the welcome fruit beer mentioned online. The service and dishes in the Chinese restaurant are pretty good. In short, it is really not worth the price. The hot water is also hot and cold. Bad review! How dare you sell it for 1,400 yuan!

msg:Staying in the Pillow Field Room, you can open the door to a rice field, a mature rice field nearby, a misty mountain view in the distance, and the cicadas and frogs in summer, very nice rural scenery~
But there are some details that can be done better. One is that the balcony has such a good view, can it be equipped with an outdoor seat? You can drink tea while looking at the scenery. The second is that the hotel swimming pool is too dark at night, and the water in the swimming pool is also deep. It is not safe for children to go to the swimming pool at night.
Overall, I am very satisfied, and I look forward to improving the details 😊

The restaurant in the hotel is delicious. I recommend the Chinese restaurant. Rice wine, passion fruit ribs, and roast chicken are all good. Although there was a power outage due to heavy rain, the staff are well-trained and have a good attitude. They deal with it in a timely manner and will come again!

The sound insulation of the upper and lower floors is not very good. It is recommended to ask the hotel to live on the top floor. The bullfrogs scream too much at night, but it is too tiring.

The swimming pool water is not very clean. There seems to be moss on the pool wall. The breakfast buffet is at the level of a business hotel. The afternoon tea provided can only be used for punch cards. The taste needs to be improved. If it is about 500 yuan, it is acceptable, and it is more than 1,500 yuan. Not worth it.

1. The hotel staff are attentive, responsive, and responsive.
2. Tableware, bedding, and furniture can be seen to be carefully selected and tasteful. Especially praise the bath products - use "CHALING", this brand is a brand of LVMH, very niche, the main focus is the fragrance of Yunnan Pu'er tea, the use feeling and smell are of course very comfortable and pleasant!
3. The buffet breakfast is also rich, and the ingredients are relatively fresh. What is more attentive is that you can drink the local specialty "Camellia oleifera".
4. You have to pick a fly in the oin**ent——Affected by geography and climate, the room on the first floor will be a little humid. If you are going to get close to nature, you should pay attention. So this time I finally chose a room on the second floor, the view is also beautiful, waking up in the fields every day is so healing! peace～

The other big bed room I originally booked is in another building because my mother booked a more expensive room for the elders on her birthday. We stayed in the ordinary mountain view room. . When we checked in, Xiao Li at the front desk was very enthusiastic and patient to show us the room. Knowing that it was my mother’s birthday that day, she even applied for a free upgrade from the Mountain View King Room to the Love Forest King Room. The two rooms are next door. He also gave us a birthday cake, which is greatly appreciated. The cake is quite delicate. The other service staff are polite and service in place.

The taste of the Chinese restaurant is very good. Every dish I ordered is delicious. The price is not expensive. The restaurant for breakfast has a nice view. This hotel is worth owning. The family is very satisfied.

It’s also fun to rent a battery car for tens of dollars in Mingshi Tianyuan, ride a small motorcycle, and follow the greenway cycling route. Also saw a lot of scenery.

Facilities: The room size is small, but the decoration details are very user-friendly, and the convenience of use is carefully considered. For example, the bed is not attached to the wall, but a whole row of wooden tables are set up, which is convenient for placing mobile phones, chargers, and many plugs. The same goes for the hook position in the bathroom. The bath is cha ling brand, quality!

Hygiene: It is comfortable, completely at the level of a four-star hotel. Much better than a homestay.

Service: The breakfast was a surprise, rich and delicious, and the configuration was better than the five-star hotel I stayed in Nanning. Looking at the beautiful scenery and having breakfast, leisurely, 68 yuan is too cost-effective.

Bicycles are provided free of charge. The bikes are in good condition, and the models are beautiful and suitable for taking pictures. They are very good.

The value for money at this hotel is unbeatable!

msg:Highly recommended! Traveling to Chongzuo during the Spring Festival, I want to live better. This hotel is about 800 meters away from the Tourist Service Center. It has an independent gate and courtyard. The hotel is surrounded by various scenery. The restaurant is next to the river. It should be more beautiful in summer, and the pier for cruise ships is also nearby.
The hotel provides free bicycles, which can be ridden nearby, and there are many beautiful scenery nearby.
There are not many restaurants around, the price of the hotel's meals is okay, the breakfast is free, and there is a barbecue set menu in the evening. The chef is very skilled and the cooking is delicious.
The service staff are super friendly. It was cold in January. We found the air conditioner was turned on when we first arrived in the room. The service staff are also responsive, which is great.
Fortunately, I ran into a local folk band invited by the Scarecrow Club for their members, and enjoyed a relatively high live concert.
Very good experience, I hope more people can experience such a good hotel.

The supplies are very good, especially the self-produced body wash and shampoo, which are very good. The butler sisters have a good attitude and are professional. The cleaning aunt also washed the smelly socks while helping us clean up. I was really touched! Because there, I think Chongzuo I will come again!

It is within walking distance to Mingshi Pastoral Scenic Spot, and the rural scenery around the homestay can be seen everywhere. The rooms and courtyard are well designed, clean and tidy. In the evening, there are singers in the restaurant to assist in singing, and the manager pretends to be the God of Wealth and gives out red envelopes every breakfast time 😄, the a**osphere of the Spring Festival is full. From the front desk to the restaurant, the service staff are very warm and polite. It was a very pleasant stay. Recommended!

msg:This season, the outside of the balcony is not a view of a rice field, but a rice field filled with water. You can also take reflections. The river next to it is the route for boat tours in Mingshi Pastoral. It seems that the scale of the hotel is quite large. When the room is full, there are many people eating breakfast. The breakfast is better cooked in the homestay, and there is also snail noodles, but it is cooked outside. It is very close to the ticket office of Mingshi Tianyuan, and it is not bad to live here when you go to Detian Waterfall. The weirdest design is that the shower room is quite far from the toilet, in different places in the room. However, the shower has a double floor drain, so the drainage is very smooth.

msg:The environment near the hotel is really good. I did not expect the scale of the hotel to be so large when I booked on Ctrip. There are 70 to 80 rooms and it occupies a large area. Leaving aside the premium during the Spring Festival, the usual price is still very recommended.
Special bonus points: A firework show that lasted about ten minutes was arranged on New Year's Eve, and the fireworks were very impressive!
Slightly detracting points: When choosing this type of unconventional hotel accommodation, guests expect to receive butler service, but the contact WeChat reply is very slow, and they forgot to clean the room the next day
Overall, I am quite satisfied with the hotel I stayed at on New Year's Eve!

The hotel in Mingshi feels like a scenic spot. You can sit on the balcony and watch the scenery. You can go anywhere for a day. Go, just stroll around the hotel. It’s so healing. The ladies at the front desk of the hotel are very nice, especially Miss 017. She hit it off with our 3-year-old baby at first sight, and kissed like a real sister. It’s a special fate. Sister Lu Xue'e in the restaurant is kind and kind, and the dishes recommended when ordering are also delicious. Breakfast and dinner are basically settled in the hotel, which is very delicate and delicious! I feel that Chongzuo, Guangxi is really simple and honest, and the people are friendly and friendly! Like this paradise-like place! The secret of mountains and rivers, great beauty and great newness! It's worthy of the name, Mingshi Hotel will come here often in the future

The hotel is moderate in size, popular and not noisy, with complete facilities, and bicycles are borrowed for free, and I ride for a while almost every day. The breakfast is a buffet with a variety of styles, and there are some small changes as much as possible. The service staff are friendly, enthusiastic and natural. The hotel has set off fireworks for a long time on New Year's Eve, and it's amazing to watch them from the balcony. The room size is large, the only regret is that the mattress is too hard. I didn't know until I checked out that the two beds were specially made one hard and the other soft. If you like the soft one, you can turn it over. I didn't know it until I checked out. Just let me know when you check in.

Because it is a parent-child trip, our two families We strolled and chatted together, and played cards together when we were free (stare blankly). Later, because we liked it so much, we stayed for 2 more nights (from the original plan of 2 nights and 4 nights). There are also many nearby attractions, such as Germany I also stopped by to visit the Tianjiao Waterfall, the Psychic Grand Canyon, etc., very recommended hotels and attractions, very good memories of parent-child travel!

The front desk housekeeper Xiao Huang has a good service and helps to solve various problems. Finally, I give the hotel a little suggestion. Since it is in the pastoral scenery of Mingshi, riding is a kind of pastoral enjoyment. However, the hotel's bicycles are indeed unreasonable. Can re-plan, re-purchase some. After all, going to the countryside is still riding in style.

🚗 Transportation: There is no high-speed rail, so it is convenient to travel by car. The road is being built. It is recommended that an SUV with a high site come over. There are many large potholes.
🧹Hygiene: Nice and clean, but remember to close the door, there are likely to be geckos
🍃Environment: very good, sleep is quiet, corridors are well designed and not noisy
🔔Service: Good butler service and help with luggage,
The breakfast package is generally less stuffed, and there are fewer people in the package and more people in the buffet.

When we went there, the rice fields were harvested, otherwise the scenery would at least double. The food in the hotel is also okay. The buffet in the morning is slightly less variety. The chef should be from Sichuan, and the Sichuan cuisine is relatively regular. You can fish in the river next to the hotel and bring your own fishing gear. Barbecue is available on the small terrace outside the room. The cooker comes with ingredients. According to other people’s comments, it is possible to make an appoin**ent for a barbecue. I have no appoin**ent. The front desk can directly ask if the barbecue can be barbecued. The front desk can reply, but it is troublesome. Varied. The hotel has bicycles, free of charge, and there is a dedicated cycling path on the opposite side of the main road outside the hotel. Riding along the river, the scenery is also very good.

Although the scenic spot is broken, it is beautiful. Nowadays, there is a lot of commercialization. I didn't go to the scenic spot this time. Anping Xianhe is even more beautiful. Three people contracted the entire scenic spot and enjoyed super VIP services. The hotel provides free mountain bikes. The most beautiful is the sermon from Mingshi Yaju to LUXE. It is beautiful to ride around the mountain before the sun goes down. Next time I go to live in the second phase.

When I drove to the hotel in the evening, a dignified and beautiful girl who called herself Xiaoli greeted me with enthusiasm. She actively took a look at all the room types according to our requirements. She felt very good, even better than what we saw on Ctrip.com!
Xiaoli took us through the check-in process quickly, guided us to park the car to a suitable location, and took us to the restaurant for dinner. The taste was very good, especially the spicy "Daohuaxiang" fish. I couldn't help but order again the next night!
In order to make it easier for us to start cycling to see the mountains and rivers at 6 o'clock the next morning, Xiaoli took the initiative to arrange electric bicycles overnight.
On the third day, we set off to Detian Waterfall at 7 in the morning. The breakfast at the hotel did not start until 7:30. Xiao Li took the initiative to contact the restaurant to prepare us yogurt, egg bread and oranges in advance.
Leaving the hotel in a hurry, and forgot to bring two books, Xiao Li took the initiative to send Shunfeng Express to Zhuhai.
The hotel and Xiaoli there made our Mingshi pastoral trip very comfortable and unforgettable!

msg:1. The Hotel Association has issued a document stipulating that the hotel check-out time is two o'clock, and it is still 12 o'clock when booking through Ctrip! A hotel with a price of more than 11,000 yuan a night that can only be checked in after three in the afternoon has to check out at 12 o'clock. This is very unsatisfactory. I will not book a hotel through Ctrip in the future! I communicated with the hotel and the front desk service was also good, and it was delayed until one and a half. But we asked to come to change the trash can, but no one was there, and the waiter didn't knock on the door at 12:30 noon, and opened the door directly. So the service did not get full marks.
2. The room is not 40 square meters in the description. It is very small and the toilet is also very small. The room does not have the TV refrigerator and other facilities described in the room, and the internet is also very poor. I say that I am here for leisure, so I don't care about it. But in the room for 1115 nights, I couldn't accept the sanitation. I felt like nausea in such a bathroom. Fortunately, I brought my own slippers, otherwise I would really not dare to step in and take a bath. Now that I think about it, I feel a little nauseous.
3. This season is really not suitable to go. It is hot and stuffy. The fields are full of newly planted seedlings. The roses are also in bloom. There is no scenery. The money spent is actually to enjoy sitting in a small courtyard, drinking tea, looking at the river, and staying quiet for a while. But the small courtyard does not have an electrical socket, so it is not convenient to make tea, and the second phase has been under construction. It is noisy, and I feel uncomfortable in my ears after sitting outside for a few minutes.
4. The glass wall facing the river is transparent. It is not that the glass inside is not visible from the outside. The river is constantly rowing a row of sightseeing boats full of people, not only the motor is noisy, but also the kind of people watched. Embarrassing😓.

五一期間酒店有煙花秀，紫色粉色的煙花非常亮眼，西餐廳落地窗完美看秀！正常晚9點開始，昨天8點45分正在吃晚餐時突然就開始了，還在納悶怎麼提前燃放了，結果9點燃放一結束天公就開始疾風驟雨，冰雹噼裏啪啦地掉到地面上砸出一陳聲響，湖面上也浮起大片漣漪。感謝工作人員提前開秀，不然等到9點就衹能取消了，為冒着閃電為我們燃放煙花的工作人員點贊👍
在酒店玩了大半天，從入住到離開接觸的每一位工作人員都非常友善，前台小珍小黎還贈送了伴手禮，謝謝酒店帶來的舒心假期，希望將來再過來玩

酒店大堂吧設計精巧，茶飲吧風景獨特。有地面停車場，方便停車。房間帶陽台，方便觀景。床、被子還行。房內不設電視、電話，也沒有wifi。早餐品種少，品質一般，衹有現煮的麪、粉澆頭還不錯，有牛肉、雞肉。酒店沒有電梯上下樓，但入住和退房時，都會有保安幫忙提行李。服務員態度都很好，特別表揚前台小韋和小珍。
酒店有社區食堂，提供中餐點餐供應。

1.中餐廳和早餐所在的西餐廳的出品都很不錯👍🏻
2.當晚我住的房間熱水出現問題，管家及時跟進並想辦法解決問題，讓我分外感動。
3.第二天早上來到洗衣房，我不懂使用烘乾機，一位高雅貴氣的女士經過，主動幫我處理，熱情親切，後來打聽才知道她是主管，好感度又加深了。

下次，為了這個酒店再來崇左。

msg:閨蜜出行連住兩晚，酒店環境不錯拍照很出片，餐廳的味道和服務也很不錯

不足的是酒店贈送的旅拍項目
→未提前告知需要提前預約的具體時間
→拍攝不説選片張數及價格
→選片明確表達她們是要賺錢的，聽説衹選免費張數態度十分冷漠不好

用户選擇酒店同時有旅拍這個贈送項目是覺得這個是特色是加分項，最後卻因為體驗感不好拉低了對酒店的好印象，希望酒店能夠對這些項目的服務進行管理

晚上很安靜。管家也很貼心，知道我們喝水多，給多放了好幾瓶。配的茶也很好喝。。。總之細節做的非常到位。
前台態度非常熱情周到。誇獎一下小珍和小韋兩個小姑涼，漂亮而且耐心。因為客人很多，幫我們從後院找自行車。酒吧提供飲料水果和小點心，也非常好吃。我們樓下的中餐廳也值得誇獎，好吃、價格合理，所以我們幾頓飯都是特意從外面趕回來就餐。早餐就不用説了，太多品種搞得我很飽漲。
周圍的環境更是好，酒店如在畫中。人就在風景裏。早晚都是美景。我們住了非常滿意。

對於提供的旅拍，特別要説明，攝影師非常好，但預訂及後期客服的服務極差。首先，預訂時沒有説明是2組家庭在同一時間段，和當場拍的另一組家庭對了下時間，應該是我們先提前預訂，另一組家庭後訂，另一組家庭預訂時告知了。但客服未通知告知我們會有此情況，至現場才知道！
其次，7號上午拍完，遲遲未有客服聯絡選片，10號聯繫酒店，旅拍客服也未聯繫我們，12號再次直接電話當初預訂的電話，客服才來加微信，約的當天晚上7點選片！7點後遲遲沒有聲音，我們微信上聯繫，直至約7點45才有人回覆，我們改約14日上午10點。14日10點，都沒人聯繫我們，我們給客服微信聯繫，客服仍未反應，已經過去30分鐘，這一直失聯的服務難以評價！

缺點：（1）酒店離明仕田園的遊客中心和餐飲一條街還有大概1-2公里路，沒有任何交通工具。這地方打車不太方便，酒店除了入住接了一次，後面也沒有擺渡服務，不是自駕遊的話出行不太方便。（2）客房衞生條件一般。可以理解這是田園酒店，除蟲可能比較困難，但一兩千一晚的酒店看着蜘蛛螞蟻在我邊上爬還是心理上接受不了。

msg:環境：背靠眀仕田園，在陽台上可以觀稻田。
房間：佈局不合理，衞生間佔掉房間空間的1/3，房間內很侷促空間狹小，衹有一張小小的搖椅，衹能一人入座，多出的人沒有地方坐，要麼坐陽台，要麼坐床上。房間內沒有單獨的通風控制，洗完澡房間水霧繚繞牆壁都是水蒸氣，馬桶感覺不是很清潔有垢。房間內沒有電話需要加微信獲取服務。
餐食：早餐品種還蠻豐富，口味不錯。
總體來説不值800多的房價。

酒店餐廳“社區飯堂”的環境、服務和菜餚都很不錯，連吃了兩晚，當地菜和川菜都挺地道，價格比村口小菜館略高，但菜式要精緻一些，性價比還是很好的。

首先酒店沒有配備電視電話，聯繫前台全靠微信，作為1400的酒店這點非常離譜，耳塞也沒有提供，這個連全季都會有的
酒店的配套根本承受不了旺季的客流量，在中餐廳去吃飯，等了一個小時才完全上齊菜品
其次 我男朋友160斤正常重量的男生，去泡浴池，浴缸裂開了。這個質量真的不敢恭維，索性衹是嚇了一意思沒有受傷🤕️
最後工作人員的專業素質有待提高，我們問德天瀑布的大巴時間，工作人員沒有一個人知道，還建議我們坐40塊錢的觀光車去遊客中心坐大巴，或者300塊去包車。後來是外面小賣部的阿姨告訴我們 主路招手就能坐，8點多 9點多都有車，最後我們一個人來回衹花了30塊

酒店説的服務與配套設施存在過度宣傳，具體如下:
1.小童浴袍、保安搬運行李服務均不存在；
2.房間蚊蟲較多，滅蚊蟲難度較大；
3.無可打開窗户，房間換氣衹能靠空調；
4.房間的床、櫃的板材異味明顯；
5.酒店游泳池袖珍，且房間較遠；
6.房間對面稻田有其他建築，落地玻璃無法正常使用，容易成為“景色”。
酒店早餐還不錯，尤其作為一個鄉村酒店，這個是優勢；酒店適合網紅拍視頻。

2、民宿在民仕田園景區位置很好，停車方便，去德天瀑布也方便，周圍環境很好，民宿免費提供自行車可以騎車出去逛逛；
3、晚餐在西餐廳吃飯的時候，由於上菜很慢，就退掉了沒上的菜結帳走人，餐廳小姐姐知道後，特意在第二天早餐的時候準確的找到我們表示歉意，並且還贈送了一個很大的水果蛋糕，太暖心了，這服務必須手動給小姐姐點贊。就沖這貼心的服務，這家民宿值得二刷。

關於遊玩，喜歡騎行的可以租個偏三輪或腳踏車在騎行路線瀟灑一下，應該是我崇左難忘回憶之一❤️

整個員工服務到位，感覺真實不虛假。
有點缺憾的是，中餐、晚餐菜品不多，且偏川味，偏鹹辣。游泳池沒有天天吸塵，不太乾淨，有些混濁，我不敢下去游泳。

再説説房間內部，衞生間格局很奇怪，淋浴房和洗手枱馬桶分別在兩邊，沒有門，真正房間很小很小，房間的裝修風格是想走網紅風，但是細節就是農家樂的粗糙，而且一進去黴味很重，房頂有發黴的地方。

優點：
1、園區環境不錯，晚上散散步挺好的。
2、早餐很豐盛，有中餐廳也有西餐廳，菜品還蠻好吃的。早餐免費，飯餐付費，茉莉花芥末炸蝦很好吃，可惜龍鬚菜沒有了，沒吃到。
3、房間很寬敞，特別喜歡那個窗子，邊喝茶邊看村民插秧，別有風味。
4、還有免費的自行車提供。

缺點：（很難忍受的缺點，影響睡眠）
1、洗手盆的下水道反味。
2、空調沒有睡眠模式，呼呼響。
3、房間裏用的哈士奇的小冰箱，好看是好看，但是隔一陣就響一下，很影響睡眠。
4、我住的是雙床房，洗漱間的兩個洞門正好對着兩張床，關燈後，有點磣人，睡覺的時候挺不踏實的。

服務人員無數，卻服務不好三桌客人要幾碗米飯。
下單的甜品也沒上，結賬揮手，也衹是看到6個服務員圍着聊天。
猜想是分工不明確，
一張桌子會有4個人邊聊天邊收拾。
卻沒人來主動告訴我們廚房早就不接單了。
直到我們自己跑到櫃枱結賬時説，這個甜品廚房沒接單。
當我們問，那為什麼沒人來通知一下我們？
然後不回答，就去給另一桌結賬了。

這2部分的體驗是不好的

早餐選擇豐富，品質也不錯，早餐的餐廳面對稻田，風景絕佳。入住期間在酒店中餐廳用了晚餐，味道不錯，有很多特色菜，性價比也很高👍
一點小建議：1⃣️做房間時可以特別打掃一下陽台，入住的兩間房的陽台躺椅上都有一些長頭髮，最好能吸一下2⃣️浴室縫隙有些起黴，可以處理一下3⃣️如果房間能加配抽濕機就再好不過

唯一缺點已經和前台工作人員交流，就是酒店晚餐菜品真的太差！價格高沒問題但是要讓用户吃出你價格高的理由！！價格高菜品出品還不如街邊大媽炒的！菜量更別説了，另外就是身為民宿酒店，深處在明仕田園內，廣西菜品美食特色沒有，想吃個粉都沒有！打開菜單全都是類似大城市大餐廳裏所謂的那些“大菜“！那我們又何必來你這兒吃？！
是不是應該弄些農家菜？廣西小吃特色？地道本地菜品？！
希望老闆看到能有所改進
900到千元的住宿房費不是低端酒店！！高端消費不是非要吃鮑魚魚翅，更多的是希望體驗本地美食和生活！
本來想多住一宿續住，但是除了早餐很棒，其他的午餐晚餐真的不知道吃什麼，周邊環境偏僻！也不敢在外面瞎吃！酒店吃不舒服，肯定就不住了！吃住，那肯定是都很重要‼️

酒店硬件大概3星標準，但是服務很好！
吃飯的餐廳麼，很貴啦。人均150。不過山裡景區旁邊，沒辦法。口味還行。
