msg:BIG APPLAUSE & THANK YOU to chief concierge Sam Qiu for his hospitality & prompt response. Sam checked us in & greeted my elderly parents with big smile.
Sam is very resourceful! He learnt that we are foreigners of Hakka descendent & visited Meizhou for local cuisines, immediately recommended few restaurants & interesting places for us to explore. He helped us booked Di Di online, ordered food delivery to hotel before we departed to next city & even prepared disposable utensils for our meals in the high speed train, really appreciate his detailed observation & consideration! Sam extended his service beyond my expectation! 
LOVE the location, quiet & spacious room.
People's Square is right across the street. Fresh air & greenery in the morning. 
When dark falls, the whole park turns into fun fair ground for kids, dancing field & karaoke place for the adults.
Will return staying in this hotel without hesitation.

I don’t know what the lobby is being repaired when I stayed there, and it was a bit noisy.
It is more cost-effective to pay for breakfast on site than to buy it online, and the food is also rich, so it can be considered.
The service is very good. Many questions were raised, although not all of them could be solved, but it can be seen that they are trying to coordinate instead of avoiding.

There is a food street on Renmin South Road near the hotel, which is quite convenient for guests if they need to eat out. During my stay, I enjoyed a hotel room upgrade and welcome fruit benefits. The guest room wash area is not designed to separate dry and wet areas, and the water from the top rain shower is not dispersed quickly. In addition, the external noise of the hotel at night is quite disturbing to the guests staying in the hotel. Most of the hotel lobby staff are friendly and welcoming, but the receptionist at the lobby door seems to be indifferent to hotel guests and does not take the initiative to take a step forward to help guests pick up their luggage. It is recommended that the hotel management should pay attention to this.

However, there were cigarette ashes and cigarette butts in the shower room of the room we stayed in. It was probably left by the repairman who did not follow up and check in time, so it was a bit embarrassing.

First of all, thank you for the excellent service provided by the hotel. I especially like the design and facilities of the room. The room is comfortable and well laid out. Bedding and toiletries are of high quality. The room is equipped with necessary facilities. The hotel is conveniently located, close to the city center and opposite the largest People's Square. It is very lively. There are many snacks around and the taste is very NICE. The lobby attendants are warm and friendly and provide attentive service, especially Xiaotao, who made me feel the warm service from the moment I entered the door. He helped me with my luggage and introduced the surrounding tourist attractions in detail. It was like a detailed travel guide. I needed to check again online, but they finally sent it to my room. The hotel's security measures are in place and one feels safe. I was in a hurry when I came up. I forgot to lock the car door. Rain, the lobby manager, also specially informed me, which gave me a sense of security. There are many things that moved me, which cannot be expressed in simple words. If I have another chance in the future, I will definitely stay at your hotel again. It is indeed a five-star hotel. I sincerely thank you for giving me such a good stay experience.

The cleaning was completed, but it fell on the floor. The pillows were still on the floor, and the hand towels in the bathroom and the rolls next to the toilet were not replenished.

The service attitude was very good! As a result, we found out on the second day that one room came with double breakfast and two rooms did not have breakfast. The restaurant manager helped us upgrade. The breakfast was rich and had many local snacks. The service of a five-star hotel in Meizhou is as good as that of a big city.

msg:The children loved the parent-child room very much. They were very happy when they opened the door and jumped up with joy haha😄. But the strange thing is that the picture and text of the house I ordered do not match. When I booked, the small bed in the picture was against the wall. The actual thing is that the small bed is against the glass of the bathroom bathtub, and there is a mirror beside the bed. This is something I am very taboo about, why is it designed like this? Affects sleep. There is still something very hard stuck to the quilt cover that cannot be pulled off. It can easily cause injury. Didn't you notice when you changed the quilt cover? The curtains in the room were not tightly closed, the light was too strong and it was difficult to sleep. The park square opposite was very noisy. In addition, the hotel has no children's entertainment facilities and dares to design a parent-child room. When we booked the hotel, it was clear that there was a children's playground, but when we took our two children to play, we found that it had turned into a children's dance training class! The room price is not cheap! The hotel has no entertainment facilities for children. This is a big mistake! Although it is not listed as five-star, it feels full of cheapness. Just look at the room tissues, curtains and various supplies. Since the Children's Park does not have this facility, why doesn't Ctrip update it? Isn't this a lie? Everyone knows that when traveling with children, you value the hotel's children's rooms and entertainment facilities. The breakfast was not bad, the Meizhou pickled noodles are special, but the portion was a bit too much to finish. The restaurant staff was not rigorous in checking the breakfast, so the room I reserved for my parents was told that it had been used. Hope to strengthen training!

msg:The noisiest hotel I’ve ever stayed in so far, a parent-child room for self-driving with children. The so-called parent-child room is actually a modified version of the original double bed room. With the addition of a folding bed, it becomes a parent-child room in seconds! If you live on the 18th floor, you can clearly hear the square dance downstairs. It finally stops at 9:30, and then the KTV continues to play loud music until nearly 12 o'clock. Why bother in such a noisy place? Make a parent-child room type! There is also no service at all at the front desk without any notification! Around ten o'clock in the evening, a few drunks in the lobby were playing with the elevator, which made it impossible for the guests to go upstairs. The front desk was so close that no one took care of it. With my daughter, I could only wait for the drunks to leave before taking the elevator. Go upstairs and drive all the way to the worst hotel I have ever stayed in! Three points are for not wanting to be disturbed, and zero points for heart!

If you need luggage, you can help to deliver it to the room, and you have to come by yourself to pick up and unload the luggage. The room is generally clean and the bed is comfortable. Other services are not used. It's just that the heating is not enough, the room is not very warm, the point is, the quilt is too thin, two quilts are needed in this cold weather. The TV can't cast the screen like a five-star hotel. overall is good.

The bedding is soft and comfortable, and the most important thing is that the water pressure in the shower room is high! The washbasin is also a brand name, but the only thing that confuses me is that the gap in the curtains cannot be opened at all. At first, I thought it was because I did not open it properly, and the glare of the sun was shining early in the morning, which seriously affected the sleep of the guests! I hope the hotel will pay attention to it! ! ! You managers and leaders go to practice and experience it yourself!

He was not in a good mood when he saw the child crying, so he specially took the little plush and sent it to the restaurant where the child was eating. The meticulousness and heart are warming.
We woke up late and missed breakfast, but with a six hour drive behind us, I really wanted a cup of coffee. But in fact, breakfast was over early, and the equipment was powered off and put away. As a result, Fan Xin turned on the machine again for my cup of coffee, waited for the machine to rinse, installed accessories, made coffee, and thoughtfully packed it in a paper cup for me, and took a cup with me. What can I say other than good service like this? I have stayed in many hotels, large and small, and the link between good reviews and performance has really improved the service of many hotel employees. From big to seven-star hotels and small to B&Bs, almost every hotel can encounter various gifts for room upgrades and discounts for customers. This is also true. There is nothing wrong with it, but it always makes people feel that the service has changed, more like an exchange. But Fan Xin and Tao Minjie made people feel their heart in this process, and they didn't want to ask for praise, let alone a word of praise. They just did things for your sake very naturally. This kind of service is very rare. .


The service of Ling Hongyu and Li Minjia in the Chinese restaurant is also very good.
Thank you everyone!

        We stayed at Howard Johnson Changsheng Plaza Meizhou, and we are very satisfied with the service provided by this hotel. Because of their high level of service, high work enthusiasm, high work efficiency, and high-quality staff. For example: Qiu Yingming, the duty manager in the lobby, is very serious in his work and has high efficiency and high quality. At the entrance of the lobby, there is a handsome guy called Li Lijun who will help us carry our luggage. He was afraid that the road would be slippery due to the rain and would not let me find a car. My wife guides the car into place, is very enthusiastic and dedicated to work. There is also a handsome guy Yang Feng who checks in for us at the front desk of the lobby. He has strong communication skills, answers every question, responds to every request, and is very careful and conscientious. There is also a beautiful woman Xiao Qiao at the front desk (because we are too old to forget her name, the key is that she is very beautiful) respects the elderly, is very considerate and warm-hearted, has been helping us back to the room, and is very sensible when asking us what we need. The room attendant Zhang Yueqin was on call, opened the balcony door for us, adjusted the TV for us, and taught us how to use it very responsibly. Thank you all.

I don't want to comment on the breakfast. There are many styles and the only one that makes people more satisfied. I don't understand the aunt who cooks the noodles.

可以説是全梅州最好的酒店。

衞生：
毛巾不會發灰，發黃，
就是你每次去都是潔白如新，
用起來都讓人覺得放心。

被子，被單也是潔白如新，
而且特別舒服，我好喜歡那種觸感，
太棒了。

它這裏的很多小細節，其它酒店都是沒的，
比如泡澡的浴鹽，搓澡巾，浴袍，雨傘等等，
這些幾乎很少酒店會配好在那，


再比如一入住空調已經打開，
再比如顯眼的洗衣服務，
這些小細節都很滿分💯。


交通：
這裏離高鐵站不遠，
步行就有很不錯的客家菜，
比如印象好友，金苑等，
對面是文體中心廣場➕公園。

入住的房，視野都很棒，
我跟我朋友每次來都首選這家，
因為這裏酒店衞生真的棒，
而且有提供早餐服務，
早餐用餐的地方，也是高大上，
菜品也豐富。

梅州排名前五貴的酒店都住過，
這家是我回頭無數次的。
唯一的遺憾是一直住的房都是面向廣場的，
希望下次過去，能分到小區那一邊的。

一，硬件很好
二，管理很好，體現在服務上。所有員工親和力很好，而且服務意識，解決問題的意識很好。

特別表揚：
前台部，得知首次入住，幫我們免費升級。

行政酒廊，夜班的一位先生，得知我們近幾日都未享用過行政房服務，而且次日就要退房，他很體貼的為我們準備了蛋糕與飲品，還貼心提供兩支紅牛供我們路上用。

禮賓部一位小哥，看我們行李多，主動幫我們分擔並送至車上。

還有大堂一位夜班總管，什麼時候找他都是笑容很好，主動解決問題。

一句話總結，這個酒店不衹是硬件好，其價值觀體現在員工管理上，非常非常非常值得推薦。

msg:首先感謝幫我們辦理入住的客服小張，解決了我們的問題，而且還很熱情。客房服務也很到位，每次都迅速地滿足了我們的要求，衞生也還挺滿意的。儘管酒店不算新，但我所居住的房間，衞浴設施和傢俱都保養得挺好，有點出乎意料之外，房間和浴室的空間都挺寬裕的。當然，還是有改進空間的，比如電吹風需要更新換代，電視機的視像也很模糊，影響了奧運觀看效果。景觀方面，我們是面對着小區，視野受限。

對於有小孩的家庭來講，泳池值得一試，從樓上看下去挺開闊的。但洗手間就比較缺小朋友的設施，比如洗手盆對小人而言太高。我的房間每張床是1.35米，勉強睡得下一小孩一大人。

另外，梅州治安真的挺好的，但是讓外賣直接上樓直到房間，並且負一層可以直達任一樓層而無需經過任何保安設施，這一點表示有點擔心。
