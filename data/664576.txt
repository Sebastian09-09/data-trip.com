Behind the hotel is Wai Wai Jing Park. It is said that you can enter from the back door by swiping the room card, but I didn't go there, so you can judge for yourself.

Guests in the hotel are blocked from entering. Where should guests go in such bad weather where parking is difficult before stepping into the muddy water? In addition, the guest room bathtub does not have a disposable bathtub cover, which is a hygienic hazard. This is the worst star hotel experience.

1. The toilet cannot be flushed: it needs to be repaired before it can be used.
2. The sound insulation is very poor: you can hear people talking in the next room and cars on the road outside. It affects sleep, and the sound insulation level is similar to that of a fast hotel.
3. The room has a strange smell: it should not appear in a five-star hotel
4. The service attitude is average: the front desk has a businesslike tone when answering the phone and checking in. It does not have the service awareness of a five-star hotel, and is not as good as some express hotels.
