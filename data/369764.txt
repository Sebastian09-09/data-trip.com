It’s right across the road from the Mix C mall with Tim Nortons, Burger King and other restaurants almost on your doorstep which gives you that extra option for delivery of food and coffee which wouldn’t take long to get delivered. The only thing that was a negative for us was the location in relation to the tourist areas like West Lake and downtown Hangzhou, which can take you about 45-50 minutes to get to by metro, however the Peoples Square Metro Station is right outside the entrance of the hotel which is great. Ultimately you get 5 star accommodation at half the price that you would pay around the West Lake area.

There was no shortage of anything. There was night gowns for us and the kid, enough toilet paper， tea and coffee etc, too much to mention... The hotel has thought about everything one might need.   My daughter loved the play area in the room, she was too excited to go to bed at night. There was a big variety at breakfast. 
We will definitely come here again.

Service: The service was very good. The child spilled Coke on the quilt, and the aunt changed the bedding in time. There was a room with a hard mattress. The next day, the girl at the front desk changed the room and sent the room card up, which was very considerate.
Environment: The hotel has a shuttle bus to and from the water park, and there is a card to inform the departure time, which is a good comment. Because the water park was too tiring to play, I ate directly on the second floor of the hotel. The four-season package was still very cost-effective. The three big and one snack were very full. The hotel breakfast was also good. There was a large flow of customers during the 5.1 period, and I felt that I was fully prepared.
Facilities: The air conditioner was loud, but there was a vent on the window, which was better. It felt stuffy at first, but it felt much better after opening it.
In general, the price-performance ratio is very high, and I am satisfied. I will consider staying again next time I play.

It was fun and they could eat sugar paintings. They were very happy from the beginning. There was no room available when we arrived in the morning. The front desk lady handled it in advance and said that she would arrange it if there was a room. I received a call an hour later and the room was upgraded. It felt very good. The package includes tickets to Senbo Water Park and buffet dinner. The hotel is more favorable than ** for additional tickets. The buffet dinner has a variety of varieties and many people eat. It is a very good series of parent-child activities. I was careless and forgot that something was in the hotel. The lady called to remind me and did SF Express. Thank you very much. The overall feeling is good, the location is excellent, and the service staff is kind and friendly.

There are slides, swings and puzzle toys that children like, including the room settings that are very suitable for a family of three to travel. The themes are different. I happened to meet my daughter's favorite Pacha dog hahahaha~ Seeing that she liked it, I stayed for another day without thinking.
I like all the details. There is a washlet, a bathtub for babies, bathing companion ducks, a baby shower head (the baby loves it), a baby bathrobe and a baby toothbrush. I was reluctant to use the three-piece baby shower gel set. I asked the front desk for another set before I was willing to open it and use it...
After checking in, the butler added WeChat and could communicate at any time if I had any questions. For example, I asked for a three-piece baby shampoo set in the middle of the night. The service attitude was very good, and there were three lollipops in the bag when it was delivered.
The ticket price for the children's park is 39, which is really worth it. In the off-season, the park is reserved for one person. The children almost went crazy playing. There are ocean balls, sand, and everything that children like.
Across the street is the MixC shopping mall, which has Meland, and it is easy to solve the problem of dinner for children. It is not far from Senbo, and the water park can also be arranged. There is also Rotten Apple, which is a paradise for children~
In short, it is a good choice, the breakfast is also good, the room price is not expensive, and the happiness is doubled

msg:Great hotel! Across the road is Wanxianghui. The hotel has all the facilities you need, and there are many kinds of breakfast. The hotel service is particularly good. We checked in on the third day of the ***** New Year, and there were small gifts for the children when they entered. The service attitude of every staff member from the front desk to the guest rooms is amazing. It feels very warm and I will come again next time I have the chance.

msg:I came to Hangzhou for vacation during the Spring Festival. Ctrip Airline and Wine Booking recommended this hotel and the experience exceeded my expectations. Because I had children with me, I wanted the room to be comfortable, so I checked many hotels and found a room with a double bed that was two meters wide. Surprisingly, the front desk provided a full set of children's baths, and small gifts were given every day. There are folk activities during the Chinese New Year every day in the lobby on the first floor. The hotel gives away tickets to Senbo. You must take your child to experience this. The child said it was the happiest day of the past few days. Although the hotel is not located in the core area of ​​West Lake, it is right outside the subway and opposite Wanxianghui. You can eat and drink easily, and after a long day of shopping, coming back to enjoy this rare tranquility makes you feel like you are at home. Really worth recommending.

msg:A hotel I come to almost every year. An old five-star hotel with excellent facilities and services. It is located in the bustling People's Square, opposite Wanxianghui. It is completely stress-free and extremely convenient to take your children to dinner. What Mamas like the most is its hotel ticket package. You can go to Senbo for most of the day, the water park or Fantasy Island, which are all very commendable! And when there is a shuttle bus available, you don’t even have to drive, and it’s delivered directly to Senbo door to door, which is really good!
The only thing I have to complain about is their Sijixuan Chinese restaurant. The price is quite different from the reviews. Some dishes are 1/3 more expensive. The waiter explained that we should not read the reviews, saying that the prices were all wrong😒It felt very casual when ordering. In fact, our orders were a bit repetitive and too much, and he did not take the initiative to remind us that the dishes in his restaurant were actually quite large. The sample portions are for a standard table of 10 people. We only had 6 large and one small. In the end, there were so many left that we had to take away. We were not allowed to use the coupon for the Macrobrachium that we reviewed at the beginning when we paid the order. They said that we did not mention using the coupon when ordering, and they told us to use another coupon for another order. It was a bit funny. We can’t even eat it and take it away. Do we have to buy another one just to use the coupon? Although it was resolved quickly in the end, this kind of service was a bit awkward and did not match the five-star rating.
During the Chinese New Year, the hotel also sent gift boxes to each room, which was very warm. Looking forward to bringing my family back next time. But when it comes to eating, I suggest you go to Wanxianghui opposite, where everything is available😁 Unless you have a business banquet, you probably won’t go to the hotel’s Chinese restaurant again.

msg:Hangzhou is not located in the CBD. Because it’s only two nights. There is not much time and energy left for playing. Therefore, Xiaoshan District was designated as the "Famous Capital of Kaiyuan". It’s among all the five-star hotels I’ve visited in China this time. His experience is relatively the best. Needless to say about hardware. Very stylish and comfortable. The greeters are also very warm and friendly. The hotel manager contacted me about the room in advance. I booked a twin room and found the bed to be extremely small. We were directly upgraded to a parent-child suite. The overall feeling is good. It's just that the bathroom in the room smells very bad of smoke. Especially when taking a shower. It will be more serious once the heat dissipates. Twin room with bed 1.2. It's small compared to other hotels. It’s okay to sleep alone. But if you have a family with children, you won’t be able to get a double bed. Because two adults couldn't sleep at all. The heating in the room was too hot at night. It cannot be adjusted either. Understand that the hotel is centrally air-conditioned. But it would be better if the guests could adjust the temperature a little by themselves. On winter nights, I have to sleep with a fan blowing on. To blow cold. Not blowing and hot. Unable to sleep well. Very satisfied with the overall service of the hotel. The customer service manager is also very enthusiastic. Very good attitude. Just stay in a five star hotel. What I hope most is definitely to have a good rest at night. The hotel's air conditioning system is still a bit of a headache.

The breakfast was open until 10.30 due to the heavy traffic today, but the staff did not provide food after getting off work at 10 o'clock. The hotel solicits guests by offering tickets to Senbo Paradise. If they don't give away tickets, they will be beaten to death and they won't come back.

The hotel said disposable slippers were not released in the country, but they did leave disposable slippers that cost 49 a pair. We asked the waiter to give us shower gel and body lotion. The result was different from others. Empty bottles are used to fill supplements. I want to praise Huzhou as a famous Kaiyuan capital. They really consider the guests in everything and give priority to delivering these. The dry and wet separation in the hotel bathroom is poor. After three people took a bath, the bathroom was already full of water. The sound insulation is poor. You can even hear the sound of turning off the lights and turning on the switch in the middle of the night and chatting content next door. I probably won't stay in this hotel again in Hangzhou! Poor service

msg:Kaiyuan is an old local chain. I have lived in Kaiyuan Senbo and Kaiyuan Fengqiao. Does this feel like headquarters? The building is very high, and the hall for the morning buffet is very large. It may take a long time, but the maintenance is not bad. In the standard room on the 23rd floor, Jin Keer's mattress is equipped with a bathtub. Breathe through the air gap at the top of the two large glass windows. This is for the help of the staff, which is beyond the imagination of ordinary people. The transportation is super convenient, the subway entrance is just downstairs. The intersection is People's Square on one side and Vientiane City on the other. There are also restaurants, barber shops, clothing stores, etc. inside the hotel itself. The discount for in-house guests of Children's Paradise is 30 yuan per person, all-round monitoring. The child was sweating profusely, and went to the second floor to get a rainbow ice cream ball.
At night, move the sofa with a large backrest to see the night view, and feel like you are in the world.
The fly in the oin**ent is that the child found a cigarette butt behind the door. There is no rich smart on-demand TV program, such as cartoons and so on.

Children's toiletries, slippers, bathrobes, children's toilet seats, and bath towels all have the logo of the theme room, all of which are exclusive to children. There are floor-to-ceiling windows on both sides of the adult's room, and the scenery is very good.

It is very ceremonial and the children are very happy. The check-in procedure is very convenient and efficient. It is very convenient to add an account manager on WeChat and answer any questions. If you have any needs, you can directly WeChat. I turned on Do Not Disturb when I went to bed at night, and I forgot to go out to play the next day. The hotel will call in the afternoon to ask if it needs to be cleaned, which is very considerate. The hotel also has a children's playground, which is free during festivals, and the fares for guests staying in the hotel are not expensive, and the staff are very responsible. There is also a swimming pool that is free for hotel guests. Parking is free and you can come and go at any time. The location of the hotel is also very good, there are everything in the surrounding shopping malls. The breakfast buffet is also very good.

In the parent-child room we stayed in this time, the man and woman in the next room stayed high until two in the morning, and then continued at five in the morning. The baby didn't fall asleep until ten in the morning. It was really too much to bear. Their hotel manager reported that he would give a reminder, but he probably didn’t because it would have no effect. If you have trouble sleeping, don’t choose this hotel! In addition, there are no baby pillows and quilts in the parent-child room, so I can only cover the baby with a sweater at night. Because there is a big team for breakfast the next morning, the meals are added very slowly, and some are simply left empty. The concierge is also a decoration. Customers are pushing luggage and holding children, and they have to collect baby strollers for rent. No one comes to help, and even if they see it, this five-star hotel is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. one!

Staff: The child accidentally broke the toothbrush cup. When checking out, he took the initiative to inform the front desk. The front desk responded coldly: 20 each, I will scan it for you. When I informed the front desk that there might be blood stains on the bed, the front desk asked if the children were injured and expressed concern. Finally, they said that I would contact you if there is any problem with the sheets.

The front desk saw that we brought two children and upgraded from senior parent-child to deluxe parent-child for free. What's even more amazing is the hotel's breakfast, which is more luxurious than the Hilton I've stayed in. Maybe it is more suitable for Chinese taste. Welcome fruit twice a day, use Dyson for hair dryer. Rich content. The parent-child slides and dolls in the room make children do not want to go out.

The hotel has many parent-child places, swimming pools, playgrounds, farms, and organizes children's activities. Our family won great prizes.

There are Vientiane Plaza shopping malls, parks, subway stations and so on around the hotel. Whether it's a hotel or a trip to Senbo, it's all worth it.

However, I also make two suggestions. The bathroom spotlights are too dazzling, and it will feel extremely uncomfortable if you raise your head a little. Couldn't find a switch to turn off the light. Hope to improve a little. There is no shower head in the bathtub, which is not convenient for children to shower. Also, the swimming pool was so cold that my stomach and hands cramped. Children also feel that it is too cold. Generally, it is more appropriate to adjust it to 29 to 30 degrees.

Overall, the price is still very high. If the National Day can go to Shanghai, I will come to play. No wonder our company chose this hotel as an agreement hotel. It is definitely a good place for winter and summer vacations, and the best choice for business trips near Xiaoshan!

msg:The first choice for business trips is the famous Kaiyuan city. Not only is it comfortable to live, but the breakfast is better than other international five-star hotels. It is no exaggeration to say that the traditional Chinese cuisine is brought to the extreme. The breakfast area is very large, and the elevator comes out with left and right sides to choose from, and there are more choices. There has been an epidemic in Hangzhou in the past two days, and the number of people staying in the hotel is limited, but the variety of breakfast is still as many as before, which is very rare. Since the epidemic, I feel that many hotels have simplified their breakfast. The hotel is right next to the business district, and the transportation is convenient. Business trips and parent-child travel are both very good choices.

The hardware is not bad, it has everything that should be there, but the floor drain in the shower room is not smooth, it is estimated that the level is reversed. The leaking place is high, and the other side is ground, causing the water to leak when bathing cannot be smooth.
Is this hotel non-smoking? There was someone smoking in the elevator, and after getting out of the elevator, I looked for a staff member in the lobby to report the situation, with a dull expression, and the staff training was too inadequate.

[Environment] The hotel is located in Xiaoshan, the location is very good, much cleaner than the West Lake, even during the November period, it will not be too noisy. The night view is very beautiful, very suitable for a family holiday. There are several large shopping malls and Hema in the surrounding area. The Vientiane Place opposite the hotel meets the basic shopping conditions, and there are many restaurants you can choose at will.

[Service] The cleaning sisters on the 43rd floor are named and praised. They are considerate and considerate. I want to send you a small red flower. The staff at the front desk and concierge desk will be very enthusiastic on October 2-3. Any questions will be quickly responded to and communicated. Very capable; Miss Guo Ruixue also gave good night snacks intimately. The above staff made me feel at home, thank you very much.

[Supporting] The breakfast is rich in variety. The hotel has a swimming pool, gym, children's playground, billiard room, buffet restaurant, and Chinese restaurant. You can play well without leaving the hotel.

This staying experience refreshed my best evaluation of previous hotels and also made me like the city of Hangzhou even more. I will stay in Kaiyuan again next time I come.

It's not far away, it's easy to find, but there will be traffic jams in the evening rush hour, the kind of traffic jam! It is recommended to arrange time reasonably. Check-in was very fast, the room was clean and spacious. Two big and two small are definitely enough. Looking out of the window, the Vientiane Hui is directly opposite. This distance is extremely friendly to us with children. For breakfast, because it is the peak period, there are a lot of people, and the taste and category, it feels like this kind of star configuration is common, and there is nothing wrong with it. Recommend desserts and pastries, push mochi, just like Sam's. It was a very satisfying experience, recommended!

I booked the room myself by Ctrip, and asked me to go to the breakfast for the meeting, which was too bad. The parking lot is huge. For the first time, I parked on the second floor of the ba*****t. I had to follow the carriageway to the first ba*****t level to get an elevator. It was too far, and I found it after dinner at 10 o’clock and I just went to the gate. I parked about half a meter away from the car in front, but I was woken up by the hotel phone in the middle of the night, saying that my car needed to be leaned forward, and there was a car that couldn’t pass. I didn’t go downstairs. The waiter came up and took the key and went down. , The attitude is very good. Why is it so long that you have to wait until midnight to call? There were two people in the conference affairs team at this meeting, and there were no hints on the steps in some places, and there was a safety hazard.

環境還算可以，畢竟是五星級酒店，但是早餐就不咋滴了，個人覺得不如其他的五星級酒店，不知道是不是因為會議的原因，種類不是很多，口味也是一言難盡
會議室的空調也不行，外面35℃的天氣，裏面要放冰桶來降温，大家自己想想吧，希望在夏天來之前能改善。

賓館張慧賢經理熱情主動，周到細緻！我們今天上午已經退房了，她得知房間裏遺忘了一件T恤衫，她及時聯繫，並快遞給客人。十分感謝張經理！

一踏入大堂，便會被那寬敞明亮的空間所吸引。高挑的天花板，透過大堂的落地窗，灑下温暖而柔和的陽光，讓人心情瞬間舒暢。
酒店的裝飾風格典雅而又不失現代感，每一處細節都透露出對品質的極致追求。從精緻的吊燈到柔軟的沙發，從華麗的壁畫到典雅的傢俱，都彰顯出酒店的高貴氣質。
漫步在酒店的走廊上，彷彿置身於一座藝術的殿堂。牆上掛着精美的畫作，讓人目不暇接。腳下是柔軟的地毯，踩上去舒適而温暖，彷彿在向你訴説著酒店的温馨與舒適。
此外，酒店周邊的環境也同樣令人滿意。周圍綠樹成蔭，空氣清新宜人，遠離城市的喧囂與嘈雜，讓人能夠盡情享受寧靜與舒適。
總的來説，這家酒店的整體環境優雅而舒適，無論是商務出差還是休閑度假，都是一個理想的選擇。

但是！我車都到門口了，我讓門僮幫我拿一下行李，居然跟我説就放在門口，讓我停好車了以後上來拿。這難道不應該是幫我裝個行李車送到前台的嗎？
然後呢，停好車上來，到門口拿好行李，看到別人的行李車上面堆滿的東西，小弟在給他拉。我想大概是因為我的行李比較少，所以他不肯幫我拿。
我把行李拉進來，門口的小妹很友好的上來，説幫我拿行李，我就給她了嘍，然後等我辦完入住了以後。我轉過身想告訴小妹我的房號多少，讓他幫我把行李送上去，但是小妹説行李還給你，你自己可以上樓了……
好無語，所以我就差這點時間有人幫我看行李？

服務跟其他五星酒店比起來真的太拉跨了，優先接待外賓把其他客人放在旁邊，暴露客人訊息，説了需要前台小姐姐道歉，一直沒聽到她説一句對不起過。了不起！

ps.圖裡是發黴的歡迎水果哈哈哈哈哈，打發叫花子的呢。這個價格可以少點錢住逸扉或者加點錢住索菲特，都會很舒服，是我貪小便宜被當成叫花子打發我活該，感謝開元給我上的一課。

再説説整體體驗，雖然中央空調有點老舊，但是製冷程度足以。自助餐時，性價比極高，服務員態度極好。整體環境也不錯，我們住在40樓，風景不錯。這家酒店三樓除了游泳池，健身房，還有小童樂園，住店消費30元一次。我們是大眾點評買的自助餐，包含了小童樂園門票。酒店還有去森泊水樂園和幻想島的班車，也是比較方便的。整體住下來，感覺非常好，美中不足的是，外賣是要自己下樓拿。説是涉及島食品安全。也是能接受。下次再去蕭山附近，還會去住。

硬件設施能配得上他的星級，有高級感！

一個小小的缺憾就是，洗護用品的配置顯得有點low，和其他的硬件顯得有點格格不入，電動馬桶邊上缺一個放手機的託架。
 
另外，大門外的帥哥門僮，和大門內的美女，略顯得有點過於熱情，反而讓我感覺有點不適。
內心感覺自然舒適才是最得體的服務！不是一味的強調熱情！就像到高級的奢侈品店，當你內心需要店員講解服務的時候，店員面帶微笑，透出真誠很自然的出現在你的身邊！隨風潛入夜的感覺！

環境：酒店地處蕭山區，雖然離杭州幾大景區都有些距離，差不多都要30-60分鐘車程，但是酒店自身內外環境不錯，入住的面向街景這側，大落地窗無論晝夜都能欣賞城市街景，視野很好。酒店對面就是萬象滙，購物逛街餐飲都很方便。
衞生：公共區域和房間衞生都不錯，畢竟是大品牌的連鎖酒店，管理不錯。
服務：入住和退房手續都很便捷，整體入住體驗不錯，本來訂了2天，後來又續住了一晚才走。

不過酒店風格是商務酒店，沒有了度假感，可能這也是節假日沒有漲價很誇張的原因吧，性價比高。

接着去洗手，竟然沒有洗手液，理由是不提供一次性用品，但是完全可以放置非一次性的，尤其現在特殊時期
房間特別悶，空調是總控的，服務員幫忙開窗的
想上個廁所，結果發現馬桶竟然沒清理乾淨，圈圈上有污漬
接着，找不到一次性拖鞋，讓服務員送一下，結果送過來兩雙發黃的，再次聯繫前台，説是可能是沒蓋好😓
洗澡的時候發現掛在門把手上的地巾上竟然有根頭髮
還要吐槽一下，不明白為啥要安裝打開方式如此獨特的水龍頭，一點也不覺得個性有品位，洗個手麻煩死了，用户體驗不佳就是最大的痛點
醉醉的了，住過的最差的五星級酒店，再也不會來住了

環境：酒店坐落在蕭山區緊鄰地鐵口，馬路對面商場，吃飯非常方便，離機場車程不足半小時，轉機首選，早餐非常豐盛，非常好。
服務：和這座城市一樣，人文文明程度非常高。酒店所有服務人員，非常熱情，界面主動打招呼，主動開車門，滿分
定的普通雙床房免費給升級到了天逸雙床房 ，房間隔音，希望能再好就更好了，隔壁房間半夜回來吵雜吵鬧，影響到了休息，走廊裏説話大聲喧嘩，也都能聽到，這就是唯一的不足了，下次去杭州還會入住。

預訂的親子房挺好的，大床房旁邊還有有小朋友睡的床，有滑梯鞦韆，有玩具。
服務：工作人員都很熱情，提前辦理了入住還送給小寶貝玩具，入住那天剛好端午，客房還送了兩個粽子，送了水果，辦理退房還送了伴手禮，都是很好的服務。
早餐超級豐盛，住過那麼多五星級酒店，就沒見過早餐能那麼多且好吃的，帶寶寶的可以閉眼去，酒店對面就是萬象滙，還有地鐵站，可以逛吃。
唯一不足的是，第二天早上按了客房清掃服務，但是下午回來還是沒有人員打掃，希望可以改進

msg:前台的服務很好，酒店優點是帶兩張森泊水樂園的門票，開元的早餐很頂，花樣豐富，味道可口，挑花了眼吃了直接連午飯都不用吃了，對面就是萬象滙，吃東西很方便，但缺點也很明顯，實在是太老舊了，不過參照這價位，可以接受了

msg:1. 排隊入住時間非常久，晚上九點不應該這麼久。每一個住客都有抱怨時間久，除去疫情的一些原因外，也不應該這麼久。
2.大堂有人光明正大抽煙，無人勸阻，有工作人在旁邊。
3.酒店隔音不好，經常能遇到喝醉的人，可能是因為樓下有KTV的人，半夜走廊裏都會比較吵。
4.酒店的空調有點問題，半夜有點熱。
唯一比較好的，就是早餐的煎餃比較好吃。
