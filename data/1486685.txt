I didn’t much like the breakfast though and it’s also next to the helicopter sightseeing place so it’s gets a little noisy during the day.

Despite the festive hustle of Chinese New Year, check-in was a breeze, with a friendly staff member escorting us to our room for a seamless transition. Although our room showed signs of neglect, the mesmerizing view from our window more than made up for it. 

The resort had a outdoor swimming pool and a variety of dining options, including cafes and restaurants to tantalize your taste buds. Need to explore? Transportation services are readily available - just notify the hotel half an hour in advance, and they'll arrange it for you! Plus, a well-stocked convenience store on-site ensures you have everything you need. 

A highlight of our stay was the delectable breakfast spread, fueling us for a day of adventures. But what truly set this resort apart was the exceptional service. Despite the busy schedule, the staff consistently went above and beyond to cater to our needs, ensuring an unforgettable experience.

Our stay at Phoenix Island Resort Sanya was nothing short of magical - definitely a great experiences.

msg:The design of the hotel and room is fantastic! I really like the look of everything. But there are several little practical things that really make for an unpleasant experience. It's not easy to get a good night's sleep. The light switches glow in the dark which is cool when awake but not nice for sleeping. The curtains don't block out the light very well. There are at least 4 helicopters outside of the hotel causing a lot of noise from very early in the morning. The noise doesn't end. Not very pleasant. The water in the shower isn't very warm. But the shower does look very nice. I would think very carefully about staying here if a person needs to relax and sleep well. There are 33 floors. The 3 elevators are extremely frustrating. While waiting for a very long time, the elevator automatically cancels itself while I wait for an elevator. I waited about 15 minutes. Each time I have to push the button again because it cancels automatically. I had to do this 5 times just to get an elevator to get down. The alternative is to walk down the stairs from the 21st floor where I was. So many small problems. Also it's easy to replace the rusty mirror in the bathroom. The basin is also mouldy. The master light switch very frustratingly cancels the electric plugs as well. So you can't charge your devices or use the bedside plugs while the lights are off. Surely these things need to be addressed and fixed. The place really looks nice and has a lot of potential.

msg:Island is mostly apartments or closed vacation spaces. Nice view of bay. Helicopters will run starting at 9 AM, but for me personally the sound didn’t bother me. Half of the pool area was closed and the barbecue was also closed. The bar is not available until after 11 in the morning and most of the breakfast will be run out by 9:30 in the morning. They are very short staffed during the holidays so I do not suggest going there at that time. Some of the restaurant staff were criticizing each other even though it was quite obvious they were over worked and without motivation or facilitation from upper management. The island area has a lot of walking spaces but it’s important to make sure you have your own supplies. There is a store and the next empty building, but it’s just your basic overprice things with not much attention to detail. It’s just a little too busy considering the low number of staff and amenities available during the holiday. The main thing is the size of the room and the view of the Bay. The helicopter landing pad is a busy area also, so just be prepared for that. I stopped at four places along that beach area and I probably won’t be back to Phoenix island because it’s just not convenient. It might be a nice spot for people who have large families and bring in their own supplies.

The ladies at the reception desk were fast and polite when checking us in. Our luggage was taken to our room and we were informed about onsite amenities - two restaurants, a gym, outdoor pool, small shop. The staff were helpful and polite throughout the stay.

The room was clean and spacious. The sea view is to die for! & the bath on the balcony is A*.  The room was tidied everyday and fresh towels were given. 

The hotel is situated on Phoenix Island, which is a short drive from the main island. The hotel provides a regular shuttle service to and from. It’s take around 5mins or less. Taxi’s are also an option and come quickly. 

The beach can be seen from the sea view hotel rooms and is on the other side of the bridge (take the shuttle or walk)

The shower is powerful and extremely hot… some might say, like a Phoenix (which is a definite plus). The view from the balcony overlooking the ocean is breathtaking and they spiced it up by putting a bathtub there. They pretty much won me over with that. The on island amenities are great with its own restaurants, pools, coffee shops and activities like helicopter rides. You can commute back and forth to the island via a cab and it’s a stone throw away from Western restaurants in the city.

msg:Probably it was a luxurious and prosperous hotel long ago but now it's just a leftover from the good old days. First of all staff barley spoke English, we found only one guy who could understand a bit, secondly, it doesn't match the stated. We arrived at 2 am and tried to order food from the midnight menu (23:00-7:00) but apparently the kitchen didn't work. Breakfast was okay but also didn't meet 5 stars hotel standards, choice was little and when we came down for breakfast around 9 o'clock there were many not cleaned tables so we had to ask to clean up a table for us. Should mention that we booked an executive suite which is supposed to include the lounge access and when we came to check the lounge it was closed, the staff said it just doesn't operate. We travel a lot and it is a common thing that suits include lounge zone access and serve afternoon tea and light dinner for guests, this hotel doesn't have anything of that, when we asked for at least afternoon tea, first we were refused and then they served us two cups of coffee and a glass of juice! We are not picky customers but this hotel definitely doesn't deserve  to spend that money. Moreover there's nothing to do in there even swimming pools are closed. Well, i should admit the view is splendid but that is it.

No one can speak a word English.
Helicopters infront of the building make so much noise. No sound proof or light proof curtains.

Sky lounge staff is unfriendly and rude. Bartender does not know the difference between rum and gin. Gave us Gin & Tonic as Mojito's.

While trying to communicate with the manager he decided to make calls and do other work rather than listen and help.

This is the worst Hotel I have stayed at in 6 years. Horrible.

For ¥2200 a night I expected a little more than the average hotel.

Foreigners. Stay away from this place. You are not welcome. I can promise you that

msg:The best hotel in Sanya Bay (maybe the only one)
Located in Building A of Phoenix Island, the location is the best. Be sure to book a full sea view room so you can see the whole Sanya Bay. Sitting on the balcony, you can see a vast expanse in front of you.
The sanitation and facilities in the room are relatively old, and the materials are relatively ordinary. From this perspective, the facilities in the room can only be said to be so-so or even close to the level of mid-range hotels, not high-star hotels. If you go for the facilities and services, you will definitely be disappointed.
But to be honest, if you come to Sanya Bay to stay for one night and enjoy the feeling of living on the sea, you can still give it a try.

Later, Haitang Bay was developed and Sanya Bay as a whole declined. The hotel has not changed much except that it is a little older than before. The room is very spacious, with a bathtub on the balcony, two 1.5-meter beds, dry and wet separation, and Hansgrohe bathroom. There is a swimming pool downstairs, as well as a restaurant bar. The room type was upgraded for free, the scenery is excellent, and the breakfast variety is very rich. All five points are praised.

msg:To be honest, this hotel is purely hyped. I booked a superior twin room, but the living experience was not good. First, the front desk staff, the woman, always had a cold attitude. I asked for two cards, but she insisted on giving me one, and said there was an electricity card. I booked a twin bed, two people lived in it, one card per person, and everyone opened and closed the door with the property, what does your electricity card have to do with it. Second, the room facilities are really poor. The shower head cannot be adjusted in direction, the shower area is very small, and all the water rushes out of the shower room. I just want to ask, is it easy for you to clean? Third, the wall peels here and there, is it so difficult to renovate it? Fourth, there are no disposable slippers in the room, and they were sent only after calling. Are the plastic slippers that smell of plastic in the room hygienic? I really don't understand, how can this be a five-star hotel! ! ! ! Except for being by the sea and watching the sea, there is really no cost performance.

msg:It's a very bad hotel. The washbasin countertop is too small. There is no place to put things. The logic of placing the supplies is also problematic. The activity line is really incoherent. Since the toilet and bathroom are separated, they are quite far away. But the towels are all placed next to the bathroom, which makes me unable to find a towel to wipe my face after washing my face. The bathrobe is in the cabinet near the entrance, which is far away from the shower room.
I am drunk that there is no desk in such a big room. I want to order food to eat in the room, but I can only eat on the small coffee table.
There is no light on the balcony, and the bathtub is on the balcony. If you want to take a bath at night, you can only grope in the dark. There is no shelf next to the bathtub. At least put a small table for me to put my mobile phone and bath towel. The bathtub is dusty outdoors, so I asked the hotel for a bath bag. I am really convinced. This bath bag is too bad. There is no packaging. It is just a plastic sheet. At least give a bath bag with independent packaging and fixed bag.
The method of using the bathroom shower is almost transparent. If you don't look carefully, you can't see it clearly. Not everyone has used the same brand and model of shower, especially this one is different from the style and function used by the public. If it is a slightly older customer who has not used the same shower, it is estimated that it will be very difficult to use.
The room number marked on the phone in the room is different from the actual room number, which caused me to keep saying the wrong room number when communicating with the hotel front desk.
At one o'clock in the morning, several people were talking loudly at the door, which woke me up from my sleep. It may be because my room is opposite the elevator. Those people kept chatting at my door for at least 15 minutes. Later, I called the front desk to let the staff come up to deal with it before they quieted down. It may be difficult to avoid such guests making loud noises in the corridor, but I think the apology from the hotel is still necessary.
The entire hotel room facilities are too old, and the service is not up to par. The hotel has a shuttle bus to pick up passengers on the island, which was not informed to me when I checked in.

The buffet is good value for money, the breakfast is also good, and the staff in all positions are dedicated. The only slight flaw is that the charging socket is a bit old. It is understandable that the building is a bit old. What I particularly want to complain about is: There was a security guard at the entrance to the hotel lobby. We told him that we were staying in the hotel, but we were not allowed to drive in. We were told to park in the parking lot in the opposite direction and asked him what happened to our luggage. I called the hotel and asked the hotel to pick me up. Then I called the front desk of the hotel. The front desk was baffled and said that the security guard knew that guests could park in the hotel. When we drove past the security guard again, he pretended not to see it as if nothing had happened! The first impression when checking in was very bad. I hope the security staff will be given more on-the-job training. The behavior of making things difficult for guests staying in the hotel is very bad!

The service provided by Xiao Chen at the front desk was attentive and enthusiastic. The service remained consistent throughout the four days of my stay. The waiter on the 22nd floor, Liu Guilan, was particularly polite and courteous. The right person is very enthusiastic and deserves praise.
I stayed on the 19th floor and the 26th floor. The waiters were very good. I can’t remember their names.

The location of Fenghuang Island Hotel is absolutely first-class, and the hotel facilities and services are also first-class. There is a battery car to pick up and drop off the island.
It needs to be pointed out in particular that the amount of water sprayed from the shower is so abundant that it is the best in any hotel I have ever stayed in. It is definitely the first in any hotel. The amount of water is so large that the opening of the sewer needs to be configured to be so large.

The rooms are also large, and each bedroom has its own bathroom, making it convenient for families to live together. There are battery cars that go in and out of the island. There is a large farmer's market just a few hundred meters away after leaving the island. Fruits are quite cheap. There is also a pedestrian street, which is convenient for eating. After getting off the electric car, you can reach the beach, but the beach is just average. It might be better to walk to the center of Sanya Bay, but I didn't go there. The room is great for showering. The overhead and handheld showerheads can be turned on at the same time, which is very convenient. The handheld showerhead has a large amount of water and is very comfortable. The only downside is that the two buildings next door have flashing lights at night, which is a bit scary at first glance. It's a pity that it was cloudy these two days. I believe the scenery will be spectacular on a clear day!

The hotel's garden landscape is unique and has a strong tropical a**osphere. Of course, there are also shortcomings. First, there are insufficient seats in the breakfast restaurant, so there are no seats and queuing. At the same time, the closing time is too early. It is recommended that breakfast be served directly until 12 o'clock, which will have a more resort hotel feel; second, washing and drying are separated. But there is no place to put clothes in the bathroom, and the sink is too small and there is no place to put things. Overall, the accommodation experience was great, with good service and beautiful scenery.

Regarding the location, it is a short taxi ride to the Daiichi Seafood Market.
You can also enjoy street food. (This was pretty much my deciding factor)
The hotel was built about 10 years ago, so the cleanliness was average.
The view is very beautiful both day and night. (Photos are of the 32nd and 28th floors)
If you're going to stay in Sanya Bay, you might want to stay there once.

We are installing exterior lighting for the ***** New Year, so
I was surprised when the builder suddenly appeared from the balcony the next morning.
There was a notice sheet in the room, but there was no prior explanation.

After discussions with the hotel, we were exchanged for a room that would not undergo any construction work.
Therefore, even though I stayed for one night, there are two types of room photos.

There is a wall of floor-to-ceiling folding windows in the lobby, which is transparent and beautiful👍. The room is reasonably designed, clean and comfortable.

Now there are no restrictions, and the night view of the past is indeed gone. There are two helicopter airports on the island, and many tourists experience helicopter flights. There are five identical buildings on the island and two outdoor swimming pools. As the best hotel on the island, although it has a certain age, you can feel the luxury of the time from the Geberit toilet and Hansgrohe shower used in the room. The water in the shower is really big, like a reservoir opening to release water. It is very convenient to have unlimited transfers in and out of the island by battery car. The water in the swimming pool downstairs has just been changed, and the view from the sky lounge on the top floor is still beautiful. Looking out from the room, there are beautiful sea views everywhere. If the mold in the room can be eliminated, the pearl can still shine.

msg:I gave the environment five points, which is why we stayed for the fourth time. I really like the feeling that this hotel is in the sea.
2017, 2018, 2019, 2023 (three of the four stays were booked on Ctrip, and the first booking was on booking), but this fourth time was very disappointing. First of all, the interior decoration has fallen into disrepair. I feel defeated. Small damages to the marble can be seen everywhere. There are also many small stains on the toilet buttons. There are new molds on the ceiling of two bedrooms and one living room near the air conditioner outlet. Mold spores can easily be blown by the wind. Flying everywhere! After being reminded, the room attendant came and wiped it off. The jacuzzi on the balcony was broken. Later, we asked to change the room, but the one we wanted to change was still broken, so we didn’t change it;
Second, the buffet on the first floor has canceled the original indoor part (we did not eat out of the hotel for the first three times, and all our meals depended on the buffet on the first floor of the hotel, Chinese food on the fifth floor, and Western food at noon). The outdoor buffet is terrible, the price has not changed, and the variety of ingredients has not changed. Few, poor quality, barely ate a meal and did not dare to try again, but forced us to find a delicious restaurant out of the hotel, this is a surprise. It was also very slow to order food to the room. Anyway, the French fries that were delivered were too soft, and the coffee was extremely lukewarm;
Third, we stayed for four nights and as soon as we landed at our hometown airport after departure, we received a call from the hotel asking if we had taken the slippers from the guest room! I really couldn’t believe my ears. I thought it was a reminder that we left our slippers in the hotel, but it turned out that we were asked to take away the hotel’s slippers. I really laughed out loud. Please see for yourself whether the slippers in the guest room can be worn. ? Not dirty? Are we still going to take it away?
Such a good location, such poor management, what a pity!

The service at the front desk is very thoughtful, especially the manager Xiao Li in the lobby, who has a good service attitude and can help solve problems. When I booked the room, I made a mistake. Manager Xiao Li was very patient and helped to coordinate. Thank you very much. Phoenix Island is still as beautiful, and the service staff are equally lovely. The facilities in the room are a bit outdated compared to the last time I visited, but the sanitation is still very clean. I recommend it. The sky lounge on the 33rd floor has a particularly beautiful view. Unfortunately, I was enjoying it at that time, so I didn't take any photos. Next time I come back, I must take more pictures in the past, although the level of photography is limited, haha

As soon as I arrived at the hotel, I was upgraded to a two-bedroom suite with a living room and full sea view. Breakfast and evening buffet The dinner was great, and the children were very happy. The manager Xiao Song in the front office was very considerate. Before leaving, he delayed the check-out until 4 p.m. and arrived at the airport smoothly. The first photo is on the balcony leaning on the railing, overlooking the night view of the entire Sanya Bay and the city. The only regret is that there is no brilliant light in the past. If I come to Sanya again in the future, I will still choose this place, hoping to have a better experience.

We are the tenants of room number 1620 on July 30th (the third stay). The superior double-standard sea view room and suite we have stayed in have a wide view and are very cost-effective. What made me particularly warm was: the hotel manager over there (male, tall), met him at the elevator entrance, he was kind and friendly, and asked our room number to swipe our card and press the elevator for us. The child in the elevator accidentally said that he wanted to drink Juice, 3 minutes later, the manager actually asked the waiter to bring the drink. The thoughtful and thoughtful service made me feel at home. Like the manager, the service spirit of thinking more about the guests and urging the guests is worth learning for every qualified hotel employee! On behalf of the whole family, thank you again, Strange Manager!

Now that the weather is hot, I don’t have to go shopping around. The helicopter experience is more convenient, and the hotel also has a shuttle bus to go there. The water project thought it was on the island, but it took a long time to get there by car...

The sky lounge has a good view, but you have to go later, otherwise it will be very hot. We will continue to pay attention to improving the quality of service.

I found out that the ID card was not with me when I went to the airport. I contacted the hotel many times and the hotel told them that it was not left there. Asked to adjust the opening time. The camera at the front desk passed a long time of approval. They found the ID card. If there is no camera, they will not recognize it. Without the ID card, it will bring a lot of unnecessary troubles to the airport. I almost can’t board the plane. The child has a fever for a few days. It didn't work out. It was because of a hotel's carelessness. The short few days of vacation were so unforgettable. After returning to Beijing, I only received the ID card in the mail for a few days.

The place where you can see the helicopter yacht is quite interesting, but it is also a bit noisy, and the light-colored curtains will be bright in the morning, which will affect the sleepiness.

You won't get tired of watching the sea for 24 hours. The service is also very good. The free afternoon tea is provided for self-service. The children who are taller than others also took care of us to use it for free. I know that children can't eat much, which is very humane. The swimming pool has a pool for children, which is great! It's really a very cost-effective hotel. I used to think that going to a landmark hotel would be very expensive. I didn't expect it to be so affordable. The hygiene is good and the bed is comfortable. I will come again next time

I also gave free tickets to Coconut Grove (although I didn’t go there) and afternoon tea (the afternoon tea is very good), maybe The only bad thing is that breakfast is not included.

The sand on the beach is very fine, but there are many people and a strong a**osphere of fireworks. Two streets away is Victory Square. The supermarket is big and the price is reasonable, and there are many places to eat. It’s the first time I’ve come to live in the urban area many times. I feel that it’s very convenient to live in the urban area if you don’t want to play in the sea. It’s much more convenient and cheaper than those two bays.
The sea view of the hotel is superb, with a wide view. It’s just that there are always many boats in the sea, and there are helicopters flying next to it all day long, but the sound insulation of the hotel is acceptable with the windows closed. The breakfast at the hotel is okay, with many varieties and good taste. Will choose here next time

msg:The scenery is absolutely amazing. Our sea view room on the 16th floor is very beautiful. You can see the sunset, and the sea and sky are the same color
But the cleanliness of the hotel is too average. When I booked the room, I noted that cleanliness is the most important thing, but there are yellow things on the quilt cover, but I was too tired from flying, and I didn't want to argue with the customer service, so I slept in the pajamas I brought, but the cleaning staff was still very good Yes, I will take the initiative to ask if I want to clean the room, and the toiletries and water provided are very generous.
Another point is that when booking a room, it did not state that a deposit is required for check-in. I don’t know what Ctrip’s credit guarantee is for, and the deposit refund is very slow. We watched the cleaning staff check the room, and then waited for more than 20 minutes. Asked at the front desk, the front desk said that the room cannot be refunded until the room inspection, and we have to wait until the afternoon. When I checked out at the Coral Hotel, the deposit was refunded directly, without waiting. Personally, I think that some passengers must leave by plane after checking out. If it takes a long time to refund the deposit, it will be very troublesome if there is a problem.
By the way, finally, the hotel's shuttle bus is very good. It is available at any time. It may be off-season, and there is no need to queue up, and the driver has a very good attitude

I’ve already flown to Guangzhou, and I still want to make an objective evaluation. I drove back to Sanya from the Westin Lingshui Hotel. The selling point of this hotel is that It is located in the high-rise of Phoenix Island, but the service attitude of the staff is really worrying. There are many high-rise sea view hotels on Phoenix Island. The price-performance ratio is better than this one. It is recommended that tourists who go to Phoenix Island choose more for reference.

We arrived at 2 am, before that we wrote and asked to be checked in immediately, since we had not slept all night. We were immediately refused, even with additional payment. They offered to sleep at the reception until the morning. We came up 5 times and tried to negotiate, but no)) they told us “we’ll move you in if you pay an additional 15,000 rubles - that’s 1,500 yuan. AND the room costs 2 times cheaper.
Breakfast is NOT about a 5 star hotel, 3 stars. Even the guides at the reception said that this hotel is not 5 stars, but 3.5.
Somehow we were checked in at 9 am, I made the payment online, they gave me a card, we went up to our room, the card didn’t work. Let's go down. They tell us “what about the deposit?” . We are already evil. What is the deposit??? You just gave us a map and checked us in. They answer us “deposit 1000 yuan - 13000 rubles”. No comments. We pay the deposit and are allowed to go to the room)) honestly some kind of circus.
In the room: the door to the toilet does not close, it opens halfway immediately, there is no lock. 5 stars))))
There is no beach, the pool is already dead, there is a gate at the entrance, you open the gate and the handle of the gate will remain in your hands. We stayed 1 night and found another hotel, 100 times better and cheaper. So it goes

The best thing is the balcony, the absolute sea view, the sea breeze blowing on the balcony, not bad.

I flew here on a special trip and invited local friends to stay with me for two nights. Double bedrooms, double sea-view balconies, double bathrooms, and double shower rooms fully meet the requirements of my friends and I for a private vacation. The most important thing is to lie on the bed. I don't even want to get out of bed.
        In addition to the morning buffet indoors, the internet celebrity afternoon tea at the Sky Bar has a 360-degree view of the sea, and the evening seafood 🦞 buffet barbecue is more about listening to the waves, watching the sea, and tasting delicious food. Even the Chinese restaurant on the fifth floor has a view of the swimming pool The lights calmly watch the sea. In the afternoon, the resident singer at the sky bar will also perform at the seaside B BQ. The girl's voice is very sweet, and the sea breeze is blowing. Listening to the resident singer, the enjoyment at the moment is better than the food!

Toilets and showers are on both sides of the room. The balcony is really big, but it seems to be very weak. The floor is dangling. A lonely bathtub facing the opposite balcony is a bit awkward. The welcome fruit and minibar hotel breakfast is really not good. I feel like I can’t let it go Don’t put any salt, there is no dish that tastes good. Although the hotel has a battery car that can pick up people from the bridge, you may not come to the car within 20 minutes after you make a phone call. Many customers can’t wait and take a taxi directly. Several buildings are not managed uniformly They are all sent to the hotel. I don’t recommend the hotel service.

Our soup is cold and we asked to reheat it, and the chef even added more when it was served. Thank you very much! The short two-day stay experience is warm and beautiful! Demonstrate the manager's professionalism and humanistic spirit everywhere! ~Another price close to the people, cost-effective! I will come again!

msg:Because of the good weather, the experience of the hotel is great. You can have a panoramic view of Dadonghai, Luhuitou, and Sanya Bay. You don’t need to go to Luhuitou to see the night view. The sky lounge has a 360-degree view without dead ends, and dinner at the Chinese restaurant on the 5th floor is also available. Appreciating the sunset, in short, I personally like it very much, and the experience of staying for 2 days is the best. The breakfast is rich in variety, but the quality is a bit poor. The afternoon tea is too sloppy, and the vouchers are free of charge, so they are not used at all.

msg:I am very satisfied with the room. It can be seen that it is an excellent design of the year. Although it is not very new, it is not very old, and the maintenance is relatively good. The whole feeling is mainly arc-shaped, and I especially like the oval bathroom. The key point is that the shower room and the toilet are separated, so this house has two toilets and two shower rooms. The special material used for the walls is not paint, but it is not moldy or rotted by the sea. The sea view is very good on the balcony, you can see the sunset. The hot water is large, the shower is very comfortable, and the large bathtub on the balcony is also very refreshing. The service staff are friendly and basically responsive to requests. It is very close to the beach of Sanya Bay, and there is a free shuttle bus to Qiaotou in 10 minutes. Walking on the island is very good, clean, clean, with a line of sea view. To talk about the disadvantages, one is that the helicopter base is on the island, and it will be noisy when taking off and landing during the day; the second is that the price of the Chinese restaurant in the hotel is relatively expensive, and there is no other option for dine-in on the island, so you can only order takeaway or go to Sanya Bay to eat; the third is that Our room is close to the grill bar, there will be relatively loud music from around 5pm to around 9pm.

The lady at the front desk, Zheng Ying, is very nice. I arrived at the hotel at 10:00 on the day of check-in and waited for more than an hour. There was no room , the young lady went upstairs to urge the room in person, so that I could check in and rest after a night of traveling and traveling, thank you! The other service staff are also very polite and enthusiastic, and the big balcony is equipped with a clothes hanger, which is good
Disadvantages: The toilet and the bathroom are divided into two, with an open washbasin and a mysterious design. There is no towel rack in the bathroom, and changing clothes can only be placed outside the bathroom. Due to poor privacy, families with children are a bit awkward. I have to come out to get dressed after taking a shower for the first time. It would be embarrassing for a family of three to encounter this kind of design. The breakfast is nothing special, so-so

msg:Every year during the Chinese New Year, Sanya will stay in Phoenix Island for a few days. The hotel has an invincible view and a good location. There are many delicious foods nearby. The Chinese food on the fifth floor of the hotel is also good. The rooftop lounge has a good view at night and the internal facilities are also up to the mark. Five star level. However, I don’t know when the helipad near the hotel was repaired this year, which greatly affected the check-in experience. The whole time from 8:30 am to 7:00 pm was enveloped by the roar of helicopters. The room just checked in was facing the helipad. The sound was loud , After talking to the front desk, I changed the room to the back of the hotel the next day, but the difference is not big. The main building, as a hotel directly managed by the developer of Phoenix Island, should pay more attention to the experience of staying in customers. Now it is not as good as staying in the annex buildings of Ocean Light. If you are traveling for leisure and want to lie down or sleep late in the hotel during the day, it is basically not recommended to stay. I hope the hotel can make improvements in this way.

In the hotel room, the facilities feel a little disrepaired, the floor is tiled, but some hair is not clean... The hotel sent an afternoon tea meal, which is very average! In addition, the most complained about is the swimming pool of the hotel, which is very small and outside the hotel building, and has to ring the doorbell and wait for someone to open the door! Can see the sea, but no beach... It is a hotel for a transitional night.

msg:Sanya Phoenix Island Resort Hotel is located on Phoenix Island, Sanya Bay Road. It is an artificially reclaimed island, so there is no private beach. However, because it is located at the leading position of Sanya Bay, and there are sightseeing battery cars free of charge, in fact It takes only 7 minutes to walk to the beach of Sanya Bay. From a distance, you can see Phoenix Island. There are 5 buildings that look like sailboats⛵️ and shells. The beauty of architectural design is worthy of the name of Sanya's landmark.

1. Location: Located in the seaside in the urban area - Sanya Bay, the island also has a wedding photography base, water sports such as yachts and motorboats, helicopter sightseeing and Xisha cruises, so the flow of people is large, if you enter and leave Phoenix Island, it is for the hotel Privacy needs to be improved. The advantage is that it is convenient to travel. Whether you go to the market alleys or high-end supermarkets, you can drive within 8 minutes to 20 minutes.

2. Environmental facilities: If the entire Phoenix Island is regarded as the scope of the hotel, it is indeed very huge. First of all, the only way to enter and leave the island is a two-way cross-sea bridge, which can be said to be a flower road (Sanya City Flower Triangle). Mei), the slope is relatively large, entering from outside the island, at a certain angle, you can enjoy the visual enjoyment of the scenery in the island slowly emerging from the sea level. After getting off the bridge, the first roundabout is divided into two forks, and the right turn is Helicopter sightseeing and wedding photography, yachts out to sea, wakes out of waves, etc. 🌊 Ronin's distribution center, go to the left to go to the cruise line and the hotel direction. Since there is a wharf on the island, there is a certain amount of noise. Partners who need a quiet environment will still have a certain impact. I There are only 8 parking spaces on the ground in the hotel area, and the security will guide you to the underground garage for parking. The entrances are all guarded, and you need to scan the location code to enter.

3. Service: When entering the lobby, the staff who have eye contact will wave hello 🙋 Greetings, the tall and handsome little brother will also take the initiative to help with luggage 🧳, and the ladies at the front desk are also tall and beautiful women 🥰, warm introduction Check-in matters and the hotel's basic service facilities, since the lobby is open without air conditioning, the lady will also send a small bottle of mineral water and an old popsicle to relieve the heat. Travel strategies are provided, and the room service responds quickly, basically within 5-10 minutes. The overall service experience is that the staff has a sense of ownership and does have the feeling of being a guest, which proves that the hotel management attaches great importance to the guest experience and is worthy of the landmark. called

4. Hygiene: Generally, there is no problem. The places that can be in direct contact with the human body are clean and hygienic. The hygiene of public areas is also frequently cleaned. I ordered takeout several times and put it at the door after use, all within half an hour. I took it away, and didn't even bother to remind it.

5. Catering: The dining experience is not comprehensive due to the fact that most of them are eating out. The breakfast category is quite rich. The scenery of the sky lounge is really wow, suitable for punching in and taking pictures📷

Overall, the cost-effectiveness is high. It is worth coming to Sanya to check in at this landmark. Friends, red duck! 🫡

On the day of check-in, there was a power outage, and the island was pitch black. The next day, the glass on the sleeping tea cabinet exploded and shattered. One piece, I was shocked. I changed the room and the door lock still can’t be locked. The master repaired it for half an hour and couldn’t fix it. When I was playing outside, I called and asked us to make up for the face recognition that failed to be recorded due to a power outage. The equipment needs to be updated, and the service management needs to be improved. I don't think it will be considered in the future.

Now Phoenix Island is depressed, and the lights are not on at night, but the sea view from the hotel upstairs is still super beautiful, with a sweeping view of the sea and sky. There are pros and cons to living on the island, but it is too humid to wash a pair of socks for two days. Also, the heliport is on the island, and there has been a loud roar of planes since the morning. The hotel service is pretty good. After all, the five-star service does not lag behind. The hotel facilities are a bit old, the sanitation needs to be improved, and the environment is good. It is still very pleasant to go shopping on the island in the morning and evening. There are swings, fitness area, small swimming pool and children's play Area. The hotel buffet breakfast is very rich, and the time from 6:30 to 10:30 is very friendly! The traffic is also convenient, there are many taxis in front of the hotel.

2. The balcony of the room looks like the bay. The lobby is relatively small. I didn't go to other facilities.
3. The service is almost equal to no one. You drag your luggage and park at the door. The waiter silently sees you parked, and tells you to move it from a distance. There is only one person at the front desk of the hotel, and one or two more guests will be too busy. Coupled with the cumbersome check-in during the epidemic, it is even more chaotic. I checked in and out at the front desk, but I didn't hear a polite word
4. The TV is also broken and cannot be watched. The bathroom is so small that there is no place to put the cosmetic bag, it is very inconvenient to put on makeup, there is no makeup mirror

msg:Personally, I don't like comments very much, but I hope to give some objective sharing to passers-by like me: Phoenix Island is attracted by its appearance, landmarks and lights and wants to experience it.
1. The first image of entering the island is a depression (fortunately there is a helicopter experience base) with a little embellishment.
2. The hotel lobby feels bad at first glance (everyone knows)
3. The waiter has extra points, and the service is very attentive (holding luggage, driving the elevator). Like this 👍
4. Thank you for upgrading the room (high floor)
5. The room decoration and facilities are the ones I want to complain about the most, and there are too many. Here are a few:
5-1. Even if the entire wash area is open (the area is a problem, the large balcony needs to be squeezed out), but the designer is estimated to be a brainless person, and the water from the washstand splashes directly to the back! Anyway, you ➕ a water-blocking screen!
5-2. There is no carpet on the ground, which is really unreasonable.
5-4, the lighting is very poor, not as fast as it is, and 2 are still not bright. affect the living experience.
5-5, the sheets and quilt covers have been used for a long time, and they are all yellowed!
5-6, the hair dryer shows the business philosophy of the hotel, I am really convinced 👍 (see photo)
5-7. The toilet and shower room smell of sewage.
The five major articles are here... In short, the room decoration and facilities are one word, two words are very poor! 1 point is given to the balcony, others are 0 points.
Forgot to mention breakfast, so-so.

msg:Must be well evaluated
Scenery: Better than the Yalong Bay where I stayed later, the full sea view is stunning! Together with the entire night view of Sanya Bay, the Oriental Dubai is well-deserved
Location: Close to the old attractions (Big and Small Dongtian, Nanhai Guanyin, Tianya Haijiao) + Coconut Dream Corridor, in the evening or go to the rooftop to enjoy the sea view, or go to the Coconut Dream Corridor to watch the sunset, it is very beautiful
Room: Big! The facilities are also new, and 50 square meters can add a bed, which is much better than the Tianyu where I stayed later!
Service: Emphasis: Excellent. 1. Actively helped us upgrade to a full sea view room. 2. Hotel Manager Song coordinated a very favorable helicopter experience price; on the last day, due to the arrangement of the scenic spot + traffic jam, he really couldn't get back, he took the initiative to help delay the room until four or five in the afternoon, which greatly facilitated our itinerary, which is hard to imagine in other hotels, and I sincerely thank you!
Food: The most impressive breakfast is the porridge! It is the first time to see this category in a hotel of the same level, and it tastes very good
Price: It is a joke to talk about price without service. The booking price is only more than 600, the cost performance is too high!
Overall: Except for the public swimming pool, which is not very good (understandable, high-rise hotels are very windy, and public swimming pools are not very meaningful), everything else is very warm and satisfactory, both in terms of hardware and service!

(The scenery is so good that I took a lot of photos of the scenery, but forgot to take photos of the layout of the room...)

msg:We booked 2 rooms and each room was booked for 6 days. Manager Song, gave us 2 fruit plates and delicious desserts🥧. It makes me think that if I want to come to Phoenix Island in the future, I still need to find Manager Song. Because it is very happy to get along with and communicate with warm and responsible people. 1. The room is very satisfied. It is the one with the largest water flow among the hotels I have stayed in. The bath water can be as big as a waterfall. It is a kind of happiness for me who love to take a bath. 2. And their hotel breakfast is very rich, not so dazzling and very practical. but! ! ! Note ⚠️The work attitude and efficiency of the registrar at the breakfast door need to be improved. I have already given my room card, I can check how many people are eating, and I have to keep asking, which is really annoying. My face turned dark, and I also questioned that we had one more person to go to breakfast. Another day, we entered the restaurant with the two guests behind. We were not allowed in and let us wait. There were obviously so many empty seats inside. A few minutes later let us in again. If you are staying at a resort hotel with a few thousand nights or a few hundred budget hotels, you only need to report the room number, check the room card here, and ask the room number after checking, and how many people do you need to ask the room number? ? Do you have no eyes? The hotel’s bath towels can really be replaced by a batch, they are really old. There are holes. It's hard to wash. ......The hotel is ok, the sea view is ok. Hello, Manager Song, the cleaning and answering staff are very good, responsible and gentle. It's the female staff in the lobby who hates breakfast the most. It's so annoying... There is no day on the 25th...31 that is not a black face. It is more powerful than getting on the plane security check. MGM, Hilton directly reported the room number, never checked the room card, and questioned any. ...... I gave a super bad review to the staff in the hall where I had breakfast. It was the first time I met this kind of breakfast that I felt unhappy and unhappy.

On the second day, Brother Song helped us change a room and gave us welcome fruits. In the end, for our convenience, I happily gave a late check-out
In fact, this is the second time I have come here. I stayed in a small suite last time. This time, the two-bedroom ocean view is more spacious and the sea view is unobstructed. I have been lingering. I originally planned to live in Pullman in Sanya Bay. After all, in addition to the scenery, it is also convenient to rely on the urban area. At present, there are not many tourists and it is more peaceful and comfortable. I also took the time to eat Zhang Maomao's shop, which is also satisfied 😄

This is not the first time I have come to Phoenix Island, but this time I arrived on the island in the afternoon. Unlike the last time in the middle of the night, this road along the coast is very scenic. The coconut grove shadows the water and the white sand, the upper island just in time for the sunset, the sunset and the lonely bird flying together, the autumn water is a long and beautiful sky, and it is so beautiful. The butler brother (Xiao Hu) enthusiastically helped us upgrade the room, delivered drinks, and quickly checked in, went straight to the balcony, and watched the sunset in the middle of the sea. It was absolutely beautiful. I couldn't help but took a few beautiful photos. [smile] The hotel room is very large, and children can also run around and play in the room. Thank you for the tropical fruit plate sent by the lady in the room, which is very sweet! The night view of the Sky Lounge on the 33rd floor is very beautiful, accompanied by a cocktail full of ceremonial sense, the second time to check in Phoenix Island, a very happy staying experience than last time!

msg:As a high-end resort hotel, there should be countermeasures when it is busy, instead of making guests wait indefinitely. Changed from another hotel, I wanted to check in, put down my luggage and eat a takeaway, and then go play, but it was not done until 4 o'clock. There was no place to eat the takeaway, so I had to stay in the hotel lobby rest area, and I had to be censored If you are chased away, it's fine even if you say something to help you take it to the restaurant for dinner. There is also the same room name. When I went to live in October, it was a full-sea view room. When I checked in during the Chinese New Year, I told me that this room type was like this. I was really fooled. At that time, I only stayed at 600 per night. During the Chinese New Year, it was 2400. It is understandable to increase the price during the Chinese New Year, but only the price has increased, but the service has declined, which is too bad! ! !

I can only move in at two o'clock, and I can only move in at three o'clock. I haven't cleaned it yet. I am speechless. Upgraded the Super Seaview Executive Room. After checking for a long time, it is the same as the Panorama Room, but the location is different. After arriving in the room, the sofa is dirty. The most depressing thing is that there is hair on the bed. It was processed, but the phone number of the reservation center has not been answered. I want to consult other rooms. I am really drunk. The brand of the room does not match the price and level.

There is a strong smell of decay when I just entered the room. It is said that I just sprayed something on the floor. The smell, then why is the room opened to the guests for maintenance? Later, I contacted the front desk to change the room. In addition, as a high-end hotel, the service staff's awareness should be trained. I remember that from our check-in to the check-out, none of the staff gave us a smiley face, and handed hands that didn’t understand. Things, etc., anyway, the service is not in line with the hotel's grade. The hotel's pick-up and parking is very good! Like 👍

msg:The hotel is more than 20 minutes by taxi from Sanya High-speed Railway Station.
Independent park, on an artificial island, connected by a bridge and convenient for parking
There are also several apar**ent-style hotels in the same big park.

The waitress at the front desk checked in very mechanically and spoke very fast. I felt that I wanted to send the guests quickly. She was very tired. She would retreat to the back after she explained.

The room is large, spacious and clean, and the facilities are old
Living room, bathroom, all separated, separated from dry and wet,
Sofa, bathrobe, hairdryer, small refrigerator, safe...! Relatively complete facilities
The rooms are simple and the style is like an apar**ent.

There are two doors in the room, weird, can they lead to the next door? !
Poor soundproofing of the room, and the voice in the corridor should not be too clear!
The light in the bathroom will automatically turn on in the middle of the night! Weird
Before dawn, there are animal calls, continuous, and there are roosters behind! Sleeping is affected. The helicopter airport downstairs during the day is a bit noisy, and the external windows are soundproof.

Looking at the sea from a high altitude on the balcony sofa is the biggest highlight.
The bathtub bubble bath on the balcony is very relaxing

Hotel facilities are relatively complete, gym, shop, swimming pool, SPA and so on!
The hotel’s façade lighting show every night is good, the long-term view I saw before, this time I can see clearly

The welcoming guy in the lobby is online and has a good attitude and deserves praise

The hotel park is not big and the greenery is average.
There is no beach, you need a battery car to drive to the mouth of the island, turn left on the beach of Sanya Bay, the battery car seems to be running, you need to wait a little while in the car

The sea is clean, the blue sea and blue sky,
The Sky Lounge on the 33rd floor is a special feature, open air, watching the sunset is excellent! Appears to need an admission ticket
The restaurant did not try, no comment

The hotel environment is excellent, the room facilities are lagging behind, the service differentiation is obvious, a bit noisy, the characteristics are outstanding, and the shortcomings are also outstanding. Hope to improve it as soon as possible!

msg:酒店位於鳳凰島上，房間比較寬敞，提前一天讓酒店預留的房間衹能右手邊有海景，第二天換了一個房間海景不錯，符合全海景房的預設，酒店服務態度很好👍出島就是三亞灣城區，有電瓶車擺渡。缺點是島上沒沙灘，並且除了酒店吃飯和買日常用品很麻煩，酒店的菜超級貴，用送的套餐加了一個素菜88，味道很一般，衹能説煮熟了，要吃飯還是建議出島！

窗户外面，就是大海，離碼頭⛵️超近，第二天去碼頭坐祥龍號郵輪，步行衹要5分鐘。

唯一美中不足，島上其他配套比較少，要吃本地菜要進程，有點不方便。

一樓的自助餐不錯，人多有點小貴！

msg:鳳凰島酒店林立，真正房源充足、服務上乘、價格親民？品質過硬的也就是這唯一的度假酒店，此行帶兩位長者和妻女，感覺非常滿意，無論是賞客房佈局、床品備品還是管家服務、增值服務都沒得挑剔。考慮有長者同行，管家小曾將房間免費升級為至尊海景套房**10房間，270度觀景面向外海；看到我們家人多，客房服務及時送來蕎麥枕、薄被，飲用水都多送來一提；管家隨時應答，全程安排協調。
酒店確實有點老舊，但服務還星級標準，房間有待重新裝修，好在衞生和床品全新（就是浴袍像丐版），不過估計重裝後這價格不太可能。沒有沙灘，但周邊環境幽靜很適合長者散步，沒有餐廳，但電瓶車電話十分鐘內就送你岀島，周邊外貿路餐廳雲集，第一市場海鮮也還可以，很方便找到你合心的吃處。
鳳凰島出島不遠可以乘有軌電車觀光，我這次照顧長者租了車，是真遺憾沒能有軌電車，下次一定補上，據當地人講5塊錢超值。

再來説一下房間，無敵海景非常不錯，乾濕分離的佈局也比較合理，我們去酒店的游泳池也必須刷房卡，遇到穿鞋和不穿泳衣的客人也能及時制止，整體入住體驗都很不錯，明年的度假還會再來

雖然鳳凰島不是他們的特色島，但因為這個酒店，讓我對鳳凰島印象很好，雖然沒有沙灘，但美好的下午茶，實惠的海景自助燒烤，都給了旅行很棒的體驗。

msg:не совсем понятно за что такие высокие рейтинги у отеля, наверное за счет того, что находится он на собственном острове.
из плюсов:
- ванна на балконе, но из-за сильного ветра вечером в ней особо купаться нет желания;
- большой шведский стол

минусы:
- когда мы там были(март 2024), на такой огромный отель работал лишь один бассейн;
- персонал на ресепшене не показался дружелюбным(возможно из-за разницы менталитетов);
- на шведском столе кухня преимущественно китайская( салат не сделать нормально, фрукты только три вида),для меня это минус,для кого-то это будет плюс;
- цена завышена, это не совсем те 4 звезды, к которым привыкаешь на кипре или где-то еще в европе.

я в свою очередь очень пожалела о том, что мы выбрали именно китайские 4 звезды, а не западную сетку отелей того же уровня, так как после того, как мы провели ночь в сетевом американском отеле разница подобна небу и земле.
детский клуб о котором сказано на сайте представляет собой комнату(20м2) с мягким полом , приставкой, столом из лего. никаких аниматоров,нянь там нет, это просто номер отеля переоборудованный в игровую.

msg:小孩子要去游泳，結果游泳區那裡的工作人員告知不能遊説是要去其它游泳館，當時才下午6點過就説關門了，（想着那麼大的酒店，出於對工作人員的信任就沒有問前台）第二天準備去其它游泳館，去問前台怎麼走，前台才告知住宿的樓下游泳館是可以遊的，晚上22點才結束（就是頭天去的那個游泳館），當時聽到很生氣，反應給了前廳經理，説是游泳區的經理會給我們回覆，結果等了一天也沒回復，還有早上9點來鍾就服務員敲門，説我們退房了，人還在睡覺就莫名其妙被説退房了，這是第二次入住，以後再也不會入住這家酒店了

在這裏我實現了願望、滿懷期待的第一次入住鳳凰島酒店，從進島開始一路就感受到了花香海浪全是浪漫的氣息、大堂旁邊綠泱泱的草坪彷彿到了大草原、還可以體驗吹着海風盪鞦韆；很棒！
入住房間後、站在陽台自己就是中心、放佛站在海的中央真的泰酷啦，360度無敵全海景、也有海天一線的即視感、微微的海風讓人很舒服；隨手一拍即成大片；
同時非常方便的地理位置，離市區和機場都很近、不論是打車還是公交站基本就在腳邊；周邊設施也很齊全；
除了硬件很棒、服務也超級棒、在這裏必須點贊一下Tibbers小哥哥非常有耐心、有求必應、讓我感覺倍感親切、倍感暖心並且備受歡迎了、真的一級棒！♥️筆芯！
總體感受物超所值！下次還來……

msg:原以為好點的酒店是三亞最後一片不被宰的凈土，殊不知一時大意，入住這家酒店又掉進了欺客宰客圈套。本來入住時在前台諮詢島上之前玩水上項目的搬去了哪裡，前台讓諮詢禮賓部的同事，禮賓部的同事讓加他微信，並報了價格，感覺酒店應該有合作的船衹，就微信轉了錢，沒想到就這樣我們被轉賣給了一箇中介，然後中介又不知道轉了幾道手叫的船帶我們出海。整體體驗非常差，船也不守時，讓我們大太陽在碼頭曬了十分鐘，船上出了問題，聯繫酒店禮賓部的人，他讓我自己和船長協商，讓定船的時候什麼都答應的很好，承諾兑現不了就不管了。我不知道這是酒店行為還是個人行為。如果是個人行為，酒店是怎麼能縱容員工在酒店大堂拉客，然後又轉賣給中介的？酒店給員工發不起工資了嗎？如果説酒店是默許這樣做的，那能不能把服務提高一下，不要吃相這麼難看，收了錢後面的事情一概不管了。價格比網上定貴了好幾百，體驗卻差的讓人心情不好一整天。這次三亞之行住了四個五星酒店，海棠灣的四個都很好，就這個是最糟心的一個。

ps：酒店自助早餐建議隔天換一些樣式，住一週的話確實有點膩了

msg:是愉快的住店體驗，順便做個簡單的三亞攻略。三亞灣海水確實不如亞龍灣。但勝在交通方便，吃的地方比如億恆夜市、椰夢長廊、第一市場等等坐公交很方便。亞龍灣確實美，但交通不便利，離市中心遠，所以鳳凰島選擇四晚連住，海景絕佳，唯一就是正前方被一棟樓擋的嚴實，但去陽台兩邊都是絕美海景，早晨能看到很多船從鹿回頭碼頭開出來駛入大海。其次出行。有接駁車可以免費進出鳳凰島，去坐公交就可以到達，包括億恆夜市第一市場三亞河南山寺等一切需要去的。離夜市市場都很近，晚上回來得晚可以給酒店打電話讓接駁車接進去島，所以覺得很方便，性價比高的五星酒店，前台服務很好，免費升級房型，房間很大，陽台超大，浴缸泡澡超舒服，免費提供一次性泡澡塑料布和泡泡浴沐浴液，累一天泡澡太舒服了。總之，很讚的體驗，原本想換房但捨不得這個大浴缸。
