msg:This should be the best hotel in Dali. But it's because of the very personal service that the concierge gave. Coco went way beyond her responsibilities to meet our requests and even offer more than what we asked for. She always reponded to our weChat text very quickly. Coco really deserves to be rewarded. It reflects a good culture in the hotel as other staff are also very helpful. It really made our stay in Dali memorable. Location of the hotel is also very good; just opposite the cruise terminal and a short walk to many restaurants. The view of the lake from the room is really nice. Breakfast is also good and extensive. If I ever visit Dali again, I will surely stay at Pullman again, and look for Coco.

Great sights from the pool and gym though we didn’t get a chance to use it. Impeccable service from the front desk and concierge - they were helpful in introducing the area, helping with luggage and delivery, as well as providing great transport advice and food recommendations. Special mention to Edison for the great advice.

I chose a deluxe twin room because I was traveling with children and the elderly. The elderly were not very mobile and were pushed in a wheelchair most of the time. After arriving at the hotel, because the room was not ready yet and there were elderly people, Edison, who received me at the front desk, upgraded our room directly. He said that I could just call him Xiaobao. He was kind and enthusiastic ❤️. After that, I added WeChat, cotton swabs, laundry detergent, delayed check-out, and responded positively and patiently. In short, I am very satisfied! I have recommended it to my friends.

We upgraded to a selected sea view room and leaned against the hotel's designed tea-making window bar. The Erhai Lake opposite was in full view, and we didn't need to take a ferry 🚢 to visit, which saved a lot of time.
In addition, on the day of check-in, Molly learned that we had not had lunch yet, and she was very considerate to help us book a Dai-style restaurant on the fifth floor. It was another pleasant surprise. It was suggested that guests staying in the hotel could dine on the second and fifth floors of the hotel. The cooking skills were particularly good, and you could also enjoy the beautiful scenery of Erhai Lake while dining.

Pullman's facilities and hygiene are impeccable. The hotel upgraded the lake view room for free. The meticulous service is impressive. The oversized glass can see the Erhai Lake opposite at a glance. It is unique to fall asleep every night with the whistle of the Dali Port ferry. For parent-child travel, the 23rd floor heated swimming pool and gym can take babies to swim. At night, you can go to the starry sky bar on the 24th floor to check in and take pictures for free, and feel the night of Dali. The food is normal star hotel price, without any offset. In short, it is highly recommended.

msg:Considering the location, transportation, service quality, catering quality, and hygiene & safety, I chose a branded hotel at the same price, just to save worry and feel at ease. As it turns out, I made the right choice!
Transportation: 30 minutes from Dali Airport and 10 minutes from the high-speed rail station. Even if you order takeout, you can enjoy the route advantages of both the ancient city and the city (there are more varieties than the homestays in Haixi and Haidong)
In addition, the hotel is opposite Dali Port! Super convenient!
Facilities and hygiene: New hotel, everything is guaranteed. I have to praise the windows, they are so clean! Watching the sunrise in the room in the morning (although the location is remote, the morning glow is also beautiful) is completely ok!
Service quality: The housekeeper Miss Solar always responds positively from the perspective of guest needs. Very trustworthy~ The room arranged has a direct view of Erhai Lake, and you can see Cangshan Mountain (although the clouds are thick in May) and Erhai Lake~ Very satisfied~ The front desk and other waiters are also very polite and enthusiastic~
Food quality: The two best meals I had in Dali were at Pullman Hotel... Well, Dali Scenic Area is a food desert... Even the pizza ordered from Pizza Hut is so bad that it's incredible. You must try the cross-bridge rice noodles in Pullman's Chinese restaurant! The soup is delicious, the rice noodles are smooth, and the ingredients are fresh and rich! ! ! The Japanese skewers at the Starry Sky Bar on the last day are also very distinctive (Yunnan-style grilled skewers). PS: Starry Sky Bar requires reservations, and it is best to ask the chef if the reservation time is available, otherwise the meal may take a while.
Finally, I strongly recommend Pullman's cross-bridge rice noodles and lake view rooms again! ! !

On the day of check-in, we found that we were very satisfied with the room! If the hotel leader sees the comments, I hope she can be praised.
In addition, the starry sky bar of the hotel is very colorful, you can see Cangshan Mountain and Erhai Lake quietly! You can arrange all the heavyweight attractions in Dali without leaving the hotel!

msg:I stayed at Junfa Berman again and felt as good as before. It is a first-class hotel. Time has passed, but the hotel service, room furnishings and hardware facilities are satisfactory. What's more gratifying is that the service is more humane and warmer than before, which really makes people feel at home. The front desk also upgraded the room type. Mary, the lady in charge of customers, followed the whole process, constantly asked about the room situation, and made suggestions and help. It's great!

The room is clean and comfortable, and the breakfast is quite satisfactory. The starry sky bar on the top floor can see the whole picture of Dali city, and there is a nice sunset when the weather is good. Overall, it is recommended.

msg:Before checking into the hotel, customer service Mary called us to inquire about our accommodation needs. After informing us of our needs, she not only met our needs, but also took the initiative to upgrade our guest room. After arriving at the hotel, King, the concierge at the front desk, helped us pick up the boxes and deliver them to the room. He also asked us what our needs and services were. When he heard that we needed chartered car service, he helped us contact and arrange it in time. The driver, Master Yang, was attentive and provided "tour guide" service. He introduced Dali's culture, food and attractions along the way. We originally wanted to rent a car for one day, but he asked us to rent his car by name the next day. When we asked if there was a drop-off service, the hotel waived the drop-off fee for us and arranged for Master Yang. It was so warm and made our entire trip to Dali full of joy and joy.

Special thanks to the butler Herman. I drank a lot that night, but the young man took the trouble to pour me water and check me in. I am also in the hotel industry. To be honest, drunk guests are really annoying sometimes, but he is really considerate.
Needless to say, the room looks as old as ever. The restaurant feels a bit small, but the dishes are fresh and rich.

msg:I bought a two-night deluxe lake view package, and then found that the same price was less than **, and the room upgrade service and airport pick-up service were not available. After negotiation, the hotel agreed to upgrade the room by one level when checking in, but the room had a strange smell (decoration smell). The manager was very good and took the initiative to change the room. 
Even if the room was changed, there was still a smell (a sewer smell), sometimes there and sometimes not. In addition, it was discovered at night, so there was no further reaction. 
In addition, the room was stuffy with the window closed, and it was noisy in the morning when the window was opened, but it was very cold outside at night. The central air conditioner could only cool. There was no other option, so I had to turn on the air conditioner. As a result, my family caught a cold. 
The hotel has a good view. The front floor is raised and it is a certain distance from the scenic area. The equipment is quite new, the room is clean, and the sense of security is full. 
There are many people at breakfast, and the staff will help find a seat. 
The housekeeper service is average, it is more convenient to go directly to the front desk. The front desk staff is very good and will handle any needs immediately.

msg:The second time I came to Lijiang, I still chose Pullman Hotel. The first time I came, I stayed at Hilton for two nights, Shuanglang B&B for one night, and Pullman for one night. This time, I stayed at Pullman again.
Pullman Hotel is a little west of the south side of Erhai Lake. If you stay in a lake view room, you can see the whole Erhai Lake without any obstruction. There is an Erhai Lake cruise ship terminal across the road from the hotel. This is one of the hotels closest to the railway station and airport on the edge of Erhai Lake. In addition to liking its geographical location and the scenery outside the window, I also want to recommend his cross-bridge rice noodles. After eating it, my parents mentioned it every day during their few days of traveling in Yunnan. That rice noodle meal was really the most delicious meal in Yunnan.
I will stay at this hotel again when I come to Lijiang in the future, and I will also eat cross-bridge rice noodles at his restaurant.

Breakfast was not cheap, but the variety was single, with more carbohydrates and less protein.

The service provided by Mary on the 21st floor was very attentive and helpful. The intimate Western-style dinner has a lot of appetite and we eat the disc every time haha...it tastes so good, whether it is the steak (tender) or the mushroom soup (delicious), it is very good. Last night was the last night of our stay. The lady before leaving Mom also gave us two little deer as gifts and she liked it very much and kept telling me that she would stay at this hotel next time!

The hotel is in a great location. The lake view room faces Erhai Lake. You can see the beautiful scenery of Erhai Lake when you open the window. The hotel is not far from the high-speed rail station and the Erhai Lake Ecological Corridor. The hotel facilities are worthy of praise. I especially like the JBL speakers, which are so beautiful. The breakfast is rich. In addition to the regular breakfast varieties, local specialties are also added, which is really considerate. The starry sky bar on the top floor can enjoy the night view of Dali. I like it very much.

The reception was given by the housekeeper Alice, who introduced the room types and the remaining rooms during the stay very enthusiastically and patiently, and also recommended the hotel's preferential packages, which was really considerate.

During the stay, all questions were answered in a timely manner. We ordered a package for the executive lounge. The family of four took what they needed and ordered their favorite packages. The scenery on the 23rd floor was also very good. Very good experience.

The scenery of the Starry Sky Bar is also very beautiful. The Xingsheng Bridge is just downstairs, and the city view and Erhai view are all in sight.

The dishes in the Chinese restaurant on the 5th floor are quite satisfactory. I was particularly impressed by the cross-bridge rice noodles. The soup was very fresh, the noodles were very chewy and glutinous, and the taste was very good.

During the trip to Dali, I didn't go to those popular homestays. It was really the right choice to stay in the Pullman that was assured 👍

The hotel service staff are very warm and hospitable from the moment they get off the car, making people feel at home. In particular, the handsome Eason was very attentive and considerate from check-in to check-out. The night before leaving, he specifically asked if I was satisfied with my stay and whether I needed to delay check-out. The very considerate service brought a perfect end to my trip to Dali.

Ask us in advance if we have special requirements such as baby beds, etc., and send us the travel guide in advance.

After arriving at the hotel, our cribs, children's slippers, and toiletries were all ready. When we opened the door to the room, we felt that the hotel valued its guests.

In fact, there are really not many hotels that can do this. This hotel is a must-choice when bringing a baby to Dali. You will not be disappointed.

Today I stayed at the MGallery in Maitreya, which is thousands of miles away. I asked about your needs, but it was like a lie. When you opened the door, there was nothing. When you come to Maitreya, you should think twice about choosing this hotel.

On the first day of our return trip, we chose to stay at Pullman, which is relatively close to the high-speed rail station.

Children's dental kits and children's slippers, small gestures are really thoughtful. At 11 o'clock at night, we needed mosquito repellent liquid and sent a message to Mary to reply immediately and arrange for someone to deliver it to the room.

msg:It was a quick trip. I booked a ticket on Saturday and arrived in Dali on Sunday. Because everything was too hasty, I only booked accommodation for the first night. I thought I would find a suitable one later and change it. Unexpectedly, I ended up booking 4 nights. During the trip, I stayed in Pullman for 3 nights. I am very grateful to my housekeeper Cindy, who thoughtfully and considerately arranged everything for me in terms of travel guide, room arrangement, and living details. She also chatted with me like a friend. , share the fun in Dali together. Who would have thought that the biggest surprise of my trip to Dali would be brought to me by a hotel. It is highly recommended that everyone come to Dali and stay at the Pullman Hotel. First of all, the location is not far from the airport. Whether you land in or leave Dali, the short journey is very advantageous. And because the location is in Xiaguan District, which is a residential area, it is very convenient to eat nearby. There are many options for walking or takeout, and it is not a rip off. Secondly, the view from the hotel’s lake view room is soothing and relieves stress! The facilities in the room are practical and high-end. Such as Bluetooth speakers and hair dryers. The environment of the gym is not to mention. You won’t feel tired watching Erhai doing exercises. The equipment is new and easy to use. The bath water is very flush and the water pressure is very stable. The breakfast is rich and tastes really good, and the shredded fish is super delicious! Finally, the attitude of the service staff in the entire hotel is very good. Good attitude and communication will really add points to the entire travel experience! All in all, this is a hotel with comfortable rooms and warm butlers. I will choose this hotel again next time I come to Dali!

msg:Pullman Dali is the best hotel I have ever stayed in. When the hotel learned that we were traveling for our wedding anniversary, the room was carefully decorated. It was no surprise. First of all, I would like to praise their front office team. They are good-looking and enthusiastic in service. From the moment you arrive at the store, they help you open the door and pick up your luggage. The guy at the front desk who checked in was always available with a smile, and his professionalism made people feel at ease. Our room is on the 16th floor. My husband said that the room was upgraded by a mysterious lady in the hotel because he contacted us in advance. I would like to express my gratitude. The window of the room opens to Erhai Lake, and you can see the skyline. The room is clean and there are no blind spots, and the bedding is comfortable. My husband started praising her from the moment he walked in, and he was extremely happy. He is picky about hotel quality. He has stayed in other hotels or hotels before. More or less, he would complain. Without going into details, it is worth experiencing for yourself. Let’s talk about the location. The hotel is right on the shore of Erhai Lake, directly opposite the dock and pier. There are a lot of restaurants around, and it’s not far from the ancient city. There are many places to check out in the surrounding area, so I recommend this place to Dali Wuluo. Finally, let’s talk about the hotel’s food and beverages. The hotel’s breakfast is rich, the dining environment is good, and my favorite cheese cubes are provided. The pre-mixed cocktails at the Starry Sky Bar on the 25th floor are also very delicious. I have to boast again, everyone in their family is so good-looking. Due to changes in itinerary and flights, I was given a late check-out! Why is such a good word so good? Close your eyes and rush, dear friends! ! !

The selected sea view room I stayed in was indeed very beautiful (see p1). The view was excellent and it also had a tea table by the window for you to enjoy. The room also provides various small surprises every day. We received steam eye masks and facial masks, which was very thoughtful! The room area is about 50 square meters, so it won't feel crowded. There is a bathtub for a comfortable bath. In addition, the supply of drinking water is really sufficient. It is the first time I have seen such a sincere hotel.
The location of the hotel is also very convenient. It is very convenient from the city, Erhai Lake and the train station. The overall experience is much better than those of B&Bs. The restaurant has Thai and Chinese dishes, and there is also a great luna bar on the top floor, which is perfect for enjoying the high-altitude night view at night.

When I returned to the room in the evening, I was moved by the flower cake. The day I checked in was my birthday. Not only was there a cake but also a greeting card hand-painted by Manager Cao. Pullman, which I have always liked, touched me again in Dali.
There is a moisturizing mask on the first day of check-in and a steam eye mask on the second day. It is full of details👍
The breakfast is very rich, really rich! The rice noodles are tastier than those outside, and the various pastries make you wonder if they are in China. The hotel restaurant has a good environment and good food. You don't need to go out to find a restaurant after you come back from the trip. The handsome guy at the hotel door welcomes you and drops you off well. All in all, every detail is very attentive. Come to Dali and recommend Pullman. It is full of comfort and comfort.

If I come to Dali again, I will choose to stay again (if it doesn’t become more expensive, haha)

From the hotel butler Herro (Xiao Wang) taking the initiative to contact us after booking the hotel, to the doorman, front desk, restaurant and other staff providing very enthusiastic service after check-in. It is worthy of being an international hotel chain, even better than the Pullman I stayed in in Macau and Sanya.
Let’s not talk about the environment. I wanted a higher floor with a better view of the sea. The hotel also took the initiative to upgrade my room type. After entering the room, the unparalleled sea view outside the window came into view, which was worth the room fee!
The room is like newly renovated and well maintained. It is clean and tidy. The bathroom and toiletries are from world-renowned brands. I am very satisfied with the mattress. It is very comfortable to sleep on. It also provides a variety of pillow choices. I have been traveling for a few days. I can finally have a good night’s sleep!
I won’t say much else. After all, it is an international hotel chain and it has everything it should have. Come and experience it for yourself!

      The breakfast is rich, including Chinese and Western food, as well as local specialties. There is freshly ground coffee and freshly squeezed juice. The only thing I hope to improve is that the breakfast categories can be slightly changed every day, which will be more friendly to people who stay for several days.

It is a few kilometers away from Dali Ancient City, Shuanglang and Xizhou respectively. It is also very convenient to drive there, but Dali is too popular. , the car couldn't drive at all, so we parked the car 1 kilometer away from the ancient city and walked in. The view of Erhai Lake from the top floor of the hotel is pretty good. The hotel also has a swimming pool and gym with unparalleled views.

The most heart-warming thing is the hotel service: 2 days before the trip, the hotel housekeeper CoCo called to confirm and make arrangements. After arriving at the hotel, because we had an early flight and had not arrived at the check-in time, CoCo was so heart-warming and arranged for us to have a sumptuous meal in the executive lounge first. Refreshments; the most surprising thing after checking in was receiving the hotel’s auspicious little lion and New Year’s greeting card. I'm so touched, thank you CoCo.

The conspicuous bag is easy to identify. The hotel is in a good location, next to the boarding pier. The guy at the front desk upgraded the room for free.

The hotel TV has a travel guide ppt, which is of high quality. I basically refer to this for travel ideas. However, I don’t know why there is no soap in the room and I have to call the front desk to ask for it. There are easily wiped dirt on both sides of the sink. I guess I forgot to wipe it. There are obvious residues on the coffee spoon, which is a bit nauseating after all. I used a cup to drink water. The hotel's handbag also had obvious wrinkles. It looked old at first glance. I don't know why I wanted to save this money and not replace it with a new one... In short, the housekeeping staff need to be better trained.

msg:If Erhai Lake is compared to a necklace, Pullman is exactly in the position of a pendant. You can do an in-depth tour of Dali like us, taking one day to the east and one day to the west.
Let’s talk about the reasons why I would choose Pullman again:
1. Check in super early. Our flight landed at 8 o'clock in the morning, and I was prepared to have to store my luggage first, but as soon as I arrived at the hotel, the front desk informed me that the room had been prepared through the butler Coco, and I could have a comfortable sleep before going out for fun. This is really a surprise for people who get up at 4:30 in the morning.
2. Lots of benefits. We booked an executive suite, not to mention the mini bar and executive lounge. We also provided complimentary laundry service during our stay. The turndown service was also provided, and snacks and steam eye masks were provided. What I prefer is afternoon tea and dinner. It's a la carte, and the quality will be better than self-service.
3. Awesome scenery. The floor-to-ceiling windows of the room face Cangshan Mountain of Erhai Lake, and you can watch the fireworks on the other side for free at night. The layout of the room is almost the most reasonable suite I have ever stayed in, and the bathroom is also very large.
Finally, I would like to thank my housekeeper, Coco, for making me feel truly at home.

After telling her, an extra surprise was arranged. My only regret was that I wasted time listening to the explanation at Nanzhao Fengqing Island during the day. It was almost dark the day after I checked into Pullman. The overall stay was relatively short, but it also gave me the opportunity to have dinner at the Pullman restaurant. The switches in the room are all illuminated after the lights are turned off, making it easy to turn them on accurately. They also automatically form night lights, making it easy to get up at night.
In short, the housekeeper should just ask Beata.

In the future, if I have the opportunity to come to Dali again, I will definitely choose Dali Pullman!

After learning that I was traveling with an elderly person, he upgraded me to a lake view room for free. , and also helped me delay my check-out time. The hotel's hygiene, service and location are all excellent, and the starry sky bar on the rooftop is a special bonus and is worth recommending.

The overall style is more business-like, the hardware is all new and very clean! The gym and swimming pool are great! The pool lifeguards are very nice! The equipment in the gym is also very complete, and it is friendly to both boys and girls~
The service is like Haidilao among hotels! ! ! ! Great, great, great! We confirmed our check-in status one day in advance. This time we got a free room upgrade, thoughtfully decorated the room for my birthday, and gave me a cake. In the evening, the staff came to sing happy birthday to me~
All hotel staff are well-trained and very professional. From checking in at the front desk to taking a taxi to leave, the butler Herro sent various travel guides before the trip, and even gave me a souvenir when leaving. All in all, the experience is perfect! !
I recommend everyone to stay at Pullman when coming to Dali~

Based on the above conditions, I gave up on the beautiful local B&B early. Originally I just stayed for two nights with the intention of giving it a try, but on the first night I decisively decided to stay another night. It felt really wonderful to lie in bed and look at the Erhai Lake. Plus, the hotel provided full butler service from before check-in. Beata (shrimp slider), free room upgrade at the front desk, and room hardware including bedding, are all very nice. Far beyond expectations, everyone can rush without thinking

msg:This is one of the most thoughtful and considerate hotels I have ever stayed in!
The day before I checked in, my housekeeper Nancy called me to ask about my check-in requirements. Since it was my wedding anniversary when I checked in, I asked if I could simply decorate the room. Nancy took the initiative to upgrade the room to a lake view room, which can see Dali Harbor. The scenery is very good. ! Because the flight was delayed, the housekeeper kept in touch with me and sent me a ppt of Dali travel guide. It has 88 pages. The content is clearly structured and provides a lot of reference for travel and food later. It is very useful!
After checking into the hotel, I was very satisfied with the overall hardware of the room. The room was very new and the facilities were well maintained. The hotel is also really considerate in terms of environmental protection. The toothbrushes and combs are made of wood, and the toothpaste is also packaged in paper, which is very environmentally friendly.
Let's talk about the breakfast. The breakfast is very rich. The Dai lemon mixed with fungus is very delicious. There are also many types of juices. The overall taste is very good.
Because of our wedding anniversary, the housekeeper specially asked the restaurant to prepare a cake, and he and his colleagues came to take photos for us. I would like to express my special thanks to Nancy, the room housekeeper, Junko and mia from the western restaurant, and Herman from the front office. Herman’s first day He kindly helped me check in and gave me L'Occitane hand cream! What’s even more thoughtful is that after we took the photos, the staff who took the photos for us were reflected in the windows, and the housekeeper helped print out the photos. The figures in the windows were thoughtfully removed and blessings were written on them. From your words, you can see that the staff is really attentive!
The staff I came into contact with were all of good quality and they served customers attentively. It can be seen that the management of this hotel is very good. Before coming to Dali, I was still torn between Pullman and Indigo. Later I stayed at Indigo for one night. , In comparison, Pullman is a level higher in terms of room facilities, staff services, parking lot, cleanliness and environmental protection.

msg:Before coming here, I was hesitating between this place and Indigo. Finally, I saw other reviews saying that this place has good breakfast, so I decided to go here. At least I was very comfortable during the few days I stayed.
First of all, the housekeeper Mary called us to confirm the itinerary before checking in, and also helped me upgrade to a sea view room, so that I could wake up looking at the beautiful scenery every day.

Facilities: Because it has only been opened for a short time, the facilities are very good. The toilet is an electric toilet.
Hygiene: very good
Environment: Just opposite Erhai Pier, it takes less than 10 minutes to take a taxi from Dali Station.
Service: I have experienced the front desk, guest room, Chinese food, Western food and wellness services.
The front desk was very considerate and gave us hand cream when we checked in. The service of the little brother was very attentive and even sent us to the room after completing the formalities.
The cleaning of the rooms is very good.
I ate Chinese food there for three consecutive nights. The price was fair and the service was very good. It was much better than Sofitel Kunming in the same group.
Western food is the place to eat every morning, and the styles change every day. On the last day, some important person in the hotel arrived. The tableware was no longer placed on the table, but the waiters helped set it. There are many more waiters and chefs on site, but if you have empty plates, you still have to be reminded to help collect them...
The wellness pool is great.

As for the elevator, it seems that every day when the button is pressed, the light comes on, but the elevator does not come and the light goes out again... This needs to be checked.

This review was written in Kunming. The service of the higher-end sister hotel is really inferior in comparison, making the Dali Pullman seem too thoughtful. Like👍

msg:This is a hotel that I am very satisfied with, a very warm hotel. The day before I checked in, I received a call from Beata, the hotel’s welcoming ambassador, asking about the check-in time, what kind of pillows I needed, and also informed me that Dali has a big temperature difference and the weather is very dry and noisy. , and also helped me prepare a humidifier in advance, which was very considerate. When I checked in at the hotel, the room was not ready yet, so the beautiful woman named Liu at the front desk helped me apply for an upgrade from the supervisor. The staff I met at the hotel were all very polite.
I was pleasantly surprised when I entered the room after taking the room card. It was a clean and comfortable room with an uncluttered sea view. The necessary things were prepared according to the call the day before. The toiletries inside were very designed and of good quality; in the evening The housekeeper also brought a facial mask when he came to turn the bed in. He also reminded me that the weather was dry and it would be very comfortable to apply a facial mask, which was another thoughtful touch.
The hotel's breakfast doesn't have many types, but it is very complete. The breakfast for three nights will have different dishes. The chef is very attentive, and it is open until 11 o'clock on Saturdays and Sundays. There are also many local Bai specialty restaurants next to the hotel, which is very convenient for eating and traveling.
Finally, I would like to express my special thanks to Ambassador Beata for welcoming us. During the few days in Dali, she always cared about us if we needed assistance. She tried her best to fulfill all my requests. Before coming to Dali, I went to Lijiang and Xishuangbanna. Dali left a great impression on me. Clean and friendly, Pullman Dali is the most comfortable and satisfying hotel I stayed in during my trip to Yunnan.

The hotel is very new and clean. When I checked in, I was greeted by Eason, who had a very clear mind! The attitude is also great! To be honest, the waiters at the Banyan Tree Hotel where I stayed in Tengchong were much better.
The hotel's breakfast is also great, with a wide variety of options. There is also a swimming pool upstairs. Members of the Chinese restaurant can get a 10% discount, and the food tastes good.
Although it is not close to various attractions, it is much better than B&Bs of varying quality!
Next time I come to Dali, I will choose Pullman!

The equipment was very new, the bathroom facilities were in place, and the service was also every detail. I haven't picked up my suitcase with my hands since I entered the hotel🤩As expected of Pullman, the details are in place.
The breakfast is quite amazing, with both Chinese and Western Yunnan delicacies. I recommend the rice noodles and highland barley cake, which are very good.
Across the road is Erhai Lake, and you can overlook the sea view from the ninth floor. There are coffee shops nearby and good Dai rice. There is also a walkable Erhai Lake viewing corridor across the road, where you can enjoy the sun and sea breeze.
The room facilities and services are in place, and my family is very satisfied. The sea view is good, and the room has a balcony window. The bathroom equipment that our family cares most about is also satisfactory, and disposable bath bags for bathing are also provided.
What's special is that hot towels soaked in ginger water are provided to wipe hands when checking in, which is very detailed.
During my stay, I came across a Gryffindor bicycle race. The bicycles whizzed by, which was very shocking!
In addition, I praised the receptionist and the front desk by their real names. Provides a very comprehensive Dali travel guide. 👍
I just visited Shandong, Sichuan and Yunnan in the second half of this year. In comparison, the service and cost-effectiveness of this hotel are among the best. I sincerely praise it. My family said it is very good. Next time you come to Dali, you should choose Pullman👍

If you have time, you can walk to the Dali Museum. The room facilities are simple and comfortable. The only drawback is that the fan of the air conditioner is loud. The difference between the room type and the room type is whether it has a view of Erhai Lake. In principle, it is more affordable to book with or without a view. This time, due to the noise problem in the room, I changed to a room with a view of Erhai Lake. , the view is nice. The staff at the front desk were very enthusiastic and recommended travel routes and food, which was very practical. They also thoughtfully provided breakfast, which is a compliment. Just a reminder, the Erhai Lake cruise in Dali Port in the afternoon is a complete scam. It costs 148 yuan just to drive a little distance and let you watch the 15-minute show. Don’t go there. The current hotel price is still worth recommending.

Although the metasequoia trees are red and seagulls are flying in, the sun has also gone on vacation. But surprisingly, Dali in the rain is as beautiful as an ink painting. It is really a pleasure to sit by the Pullman window, drink tea and watch Dali in the rain. Before coming here, it was really difficult to decide whether to choose a high-quality hotel or a popular B&B. I was worried that the B&B would be a scam, so I chose Pullman. When we checked in, the beautiful lady Molly at the hotel front desk carefully asked our requests and fulfilled them one by one. Needless to say, the room supplies were of the same quality as always. The dishes in the hotel's Chinese restaurant are great, mainly Cantonese cuisine, which will satisfy our taste buds. If there is a chance, , be sure to go to the starry sky bar on the 25th floor of the hotel. Looking down at the city, you will have a different feeling!

When I asked about the elderly people staying, they specially arranged buckwheat pillows, non-smoking rooms, and even provided Dali travel guide. When checking in, the front desk staff were full of energy, smiling, and took the initiative to help with luggage. The room is large, with double basins, separate toilet and bath, very large space, electric curtains, and complete facilities. The bar on the top floor of the hotel has an amazing view.

When I was traveling around the lake, I passed through the city and saw that the location of the Pullman Hotel opposite the Erhai Cruise Terminal was also very good, so I temporarily decided to stay one more night in Dali. , the welcome ambassador Beata contacted me by phone soon after the reservation was successful, and added WeChat to ask our needs thoughtfully. When we checked in the next day, the front desk also upgraded our original deluxe lake view room to a refined lake view room. The higher the floor, the better the view. The hotel is a standard international five-star hotel. The only shortcoming is that the entrance to the car park is blocked and is not very spacious and conspicuous. The hotel's underground parking lot is very good. The elevator can lead to the lobby. To get to the guest room, you need to use another guest room elevator, which increases security and privacy. Breakfast is also very rich. When I came to Dali in the past, I rarely thought of staying in the city. I booked a hotel either near the ancient city or in Shuanglang. Now I have an additional choice. I feel that it is better to choose Pullman. Parking is convenient, there are elevators, the rooms are spacious and bright, and the sanitary conditions are amazing. Don’t worry, it’s convenient to eat, shop and play around, and the services and facilities are not comparable to those of a B&B. Compared to the Shuanglang Seaside B&B I booked, the star-rated hotels have more guaranteed prices. Next time I come to Dali, I will definitely choose Pullman. .

msg:The location of the hotel is very good. It is located next to the Internet celebrity "Xingsheng Bridge", Dali Port, and Erhai Park. It is very convenient to take a cruise on Erhai Lake, climb Tuanshan Mountain in Erhai Park to see Erhai Lake, and take a walk along Erhai Lake.
This time I stayed in a selected sea view room. The reception at the front desk was warm when I checked in. Because I am an Accor member, the room was upgraded to the 18th floor. The room has a beautiful view. Sitting on the bay window sill and looking at the Erhai Lake is a different experience. .
The cleaning of the hotel is very timely. Thanks to the housekeeper Yin Kaixian, there are surprises every night when the bed is turned down.
The hotel staff are also very enthusiastic. We went to the executive lounge at 8:30 in the evening. Even though it was close to get off work and we were the only one, the lounge staff Luna still greeted us warmly.
It can be seen that the hotel attaches great importance to daily management and training. This stay has brought us a very good experience, and it is worth booking and recommending again.

She not only upgraded the hotel to a twin bed with lake view, but also provided drinks and snacks from the mini bar, and recommended travel guides and food. Flowers were also sent when checking out. The room is large and bright, with a wide view and an unobstructed view of Erhai Lake from a distance. The sea view from the top floor is invincible. All aspects of the hotel's facilities are relatively new. There are quite a lot of breakfast types, including some local Yunnan flavors, and there is a lot of room for choice. The restaurant is not too big. When I checked in, there was a company group meeting. There were many people during breakfast, but the service was smooth. Overall, the service and facilities are good. It is the most satisfactory hotel I have ever stayed in in Dali.

Because of the hotel’s environment and the considerate service of the butler Solar, I chose to renew the lease and stay in Dali more One day, the hotel was in Shangguan, which belongs to the urban area. The transportation is very convenient, and the location is superior. It occupies an excellent view of Erhai Lake and Cangshan Mountain. My mother-in-law caught a cold on the first day of my stay. The housekeeper Solar warmly prepared for us after knowing about it. Ginger Tea, the day before I came here, I took the initiative to call me and asked about the requirements and preferences for the room. Knowing that we are traveling with a baby, the hotel provided us with baby toiletries. The hotel also has a wide variety of breakfast items. I like it very much. Check in My two days at Pullman made me feel at home and I was very satisfied with the hotel.

The location of the hotel is very good, just opposite the passenger terminal, not far from Xingsheng Bridge, and the traffic is very convenient;
The hotel belongs to the Accor Group, and the environment, facilities and services all reflect the standards of star hotels;
Especially the housekeeper Mary, the service is quite good, she contacted us two days before check-in to ask about the time of arrival, what are the needs of staying in the store, etc. After arriving at the store, she provided an upgrade service and fulfilled our needs for high floors; during the entire stay Mary is also always concerned about our check-in situation, asking about our health, and if we have any questions, Mary will reply as soon as possible, and the service is very good;
Pullman is worthy of being a star hotel. The experience of staying this time is very good and it is worth recommending.

The room facilities are very complete, and the spare parts are all in large bottles, but the taste is still very good. There are fresh table flowers on the small table in the room, the hotel is very new and the facilities are very new and highly intelligent, the curtains are particularly blackout, and there are coffee capsules I like in the minibar...
I feel that this place is more suitable for friends who go out to play during the day and come back to rest at night, because the traffic outside the window is still a bit noisy in the morning, and it is not easy to sleep too late, but it is really quiet at night, and the other is I'm not very used to it... the quilt feels a bit thin, and there are more rainy days recently, and this thin quilt is a bit unbearable at night.
The episode was when I checked in, because I was hungry for too long, I felt uncomfortable and waited a little impatiently... Then the hotel was crowded with people, and the restaurant couldn't line up. It was a bit uncomfortable for a while, but fortunately, there were fruits and snacks in the room. Peach plus a macaron finally slowed down...
The ordering in the room may be because I am too hungry. I think the fried pork and curry chicken are delicious... 😅 The breakfast is normal and nothing special. There are a lot of bread and various snacks that children will like.

Pullman is opposite Dali Port, with a panoramic view of Erhai Lake, and the location is also excellent. The most important thing is that you can get a good rest after staying here for a few days: clean and tidy rooms, every service staff is professional and patient, and they will respond to your requests. The Chinese restaurant on the 5th floor of the hotel is definitely a plus point. I ate here the best roast duck so far 🦆. If you want to see Dali from a height, the lounge on the 25th floor has a great view (but the wind is a bit strong, so you have to wear a coat😃)

Before staying in the hotel, the hotel welcome ambassador Susie called to understand our needs and prepared according to our requirements, so I checked in It went very smoothly, and she also sent us the strategy of the hotel and Dali. We can find her if we have any questions. Although the hotel room is not luxurious, it can be seen that the various details are very thoughtful. For example, the hot water from the faucet is very fast, the shower nozzle can be activated with one button, all the toiletries are made of environmentally friendly materials, and there is also a food delivery robot. , The food ordered is delivered to the door of the room through the robot. You can check in at the bar on the top floor. The view is very good, but the outdoor wind is really strong. In addition, Pullman's breakfast is also very good, and it is also the breakfast I am most satisfied with during this trip. I especially like their rice noodles, spring rolls, and yogurt And cuttlefish ink fritters, the fruit is so sweet that it comes out of honey. Ordering food in the Chinese restaurant is also delicious and inexpensive. After checking out, I even gave the child a small doll. However, I hope the hotel can improve the scheduling of the elevator. It takes a long time to wait for the elevator. It is also recommended to add sugar packets in the guest room. People like me who need sugar for coffee still need it. If you come to Dali in the future, you will choose this hotel and recommend it to all friends who come to Dali.

The breakfast is rich in variety, and the hotel is well prepared during peak hours, so you don't need to wait too much even during peak hours.
Our group of four families also specially experienced the hotel's buffet seafood dinner. The dishes are diverse and fresh.
The swimming pool and star bar are on the upper floors of the hotel, and the scenery is really great.

Fortunately, the weather in Dali in July is very comfortable, and it is OK not to turn on the air conditioner at night. All in all a pleasant stay.

Seeing that the baby came with a plush toy, he even gave us a plush toy when he left. It really makes the guests feel at home. The hotel is very new, and the hardware is good.

msg:Every time I come to Dali, I stay in a B&B. This time I stayed in a Pullman for one night, and I experienced the care of the familiar five-star hotel. The hotel called one day in advance to ask about the room and pillow requirements, and the concierge came to help carry the luggage. , I saw that a screw in our box was loose, and helped us fix it. Anna at the front desk was very friendly. When she learned that we had an early flight the next day, she also helped to apply for a drop-off, and the drop-off driver was also very friendly! In short, the scenery of Dali's homestays is very distinctive, but in terms of service and process, it is far from being comparable to five-star hotels.
The hotel is in the urban area, very close to the museum and the Xingsheng Bridge, and it is more convenient to go to the airport. The opposite of the hotel is Dali Port, which is very convenient! Our room is on the 15th floor, with a wide view of the lake, and the room facilities are also very new.
It costs 4.5 thousand a night to stay in a homestay in Dali. In fact, a five-star hotel in the urban area is really a good choice! The next time my parents come to Dali for a trip, I will arrange for them to live here!

For a hotel in this location and environment, the price/performance ratio is really super high! Room facilities: Hotel Renovated, the closet and washbasin are very large, the water in the shower room is very large, it is very refreshing to take a shower! The bathroom supplies are very good at this price, and the smell is also very good. 4 bottles of mineral water are provided in the room every day, and there is a refrigerator There is also Coke Sprite for free. The biggest feature of the hotel is that there is a robot delivering food. I have worked with intelligent robots a long time ago, and now the technology is very mature. This robot is very cute and delivers food quickly and cutely. When it is not delivering food, it charges on the charging pile in the lobby. . Breakfast: There is an additional fee for breakfast. There are not many types but it is no problem to be full. Over the past few months, I have lived in an Internet celebrity homestay in Dali for 1,000 yuan a night. I really don’t have a good experience in this hotel. In comparison, the hotel is clean, hygienic and safe.

You can see Cangshan Mountain and Erhai Lake in the room, and the breakfast is also good.

I would like to express the hotel's emergency response capabilities. I would like to express my special thanks to Coco for her assistance during this period. When Dali was unfamiliar with the place and she felt unwell, she accompanied her from the 120 ambulance to the emergency depar**ent of the hospital. Like my family, I can feel that Coco should be a very kind girl in life. In addition, I forgot the name of the manager on duty, and she has been helping to coordinate and coordinate. Susie also came here in the afternoon to accompany and help contact the hospital that can do MRI. Really appreciate the help.

It was the first time I stayed in an Accor Group hotel, and I felt so warm. I really recommend it.

The room is directly facing the Erhai Lake, you can see the sea, the mountains, and enjoy the sunrise and sunset!
On the day of running the marathon, we got up very early at 5:30, and the breakfast hadn't started yet, so the young lady prepared snacks and fruits for us to replenish energy!
The car rental around the Erhai Lake in the afternoon, the route steward also made very good recommendations😍
The facilities of the hotel, the items in the room are complete, and the important thing is that the auntie is also very polite in cleaning!
Let’s talk about the price. For a hotel of this class, there is no price increase for the adult traffic during festivals like 520 and marathons, which belongs to conscience😀
On the return trip, the coco housekeeper also pays attention to whether it is safe to get home! Very reliable 🤩
I believe that if I go to Dali next time, I will choose this hotel and coco service👍

Pullman Dali is a design hotel that combines Nordic and Japanese styles. The service and facilities, sanitation, environment, and scenery all exceed expectations. The room has a simple log style, which combines aesthetics and practicality. There are no redundant objects in the room. The design and details of each item are people-oriented, and the feeling of use is very pleasant.
The floor of the room is high, and the space is comfortable to move around. The work table uses a round table with two design chairs, creating an a**osphere for working or drinking tea. The super-long and super-large viewing platform, sitting and lying yoga have space to use zero therapy.
The washing area is super large, smart toilet, double washbasin, just right interval sliding doors, and flexible space.

This is the best Pullman hotel ever!

The service of the hotel is very good. Before check-in, Mary came to contact me to provide itinerary advice, assist in check-in and provide a room upgrade. The view of the room is very good, and the view of Erhai Lake is unobstructed. Since then, Mary has also provided many localized suggestions for the specific itinerary and diet, which helped the author during the travel process, and I am very grateful here.
It is worth mentioning that the hotel's Chinese restaurant is worth trying, and two of the four meals chose the hotel restaurant. The fried rice with porcini mushrooms has a distinct taste and strong aroma, which is highly recommended.
The hotel's swimming pool is also a major feature. The infinity design makes it possible to overlook the Erhai Lake landscape from a high altitude. However, the specific facilities can still be improved: the dryer in the locker room is not fixed and cannot be used; the temperature of the swimming pool is slightly lower, and it will be better if it is slightly higher.

When I came to Dali during the May Day holiday, I chose to believe in the location of international brands. Compared with the bad experience in the ancient city, both Accor and InterContinental chose Erhai Lake in the urban area. This place can not only see the sea, but also avoid the flow of people. It is very exotic within walking distance. The amorous Xingsheng Bridge can also easily reach the Erhai Lake Ecological Corridor, and you can roam the Erhai Lake without being disturbed by sweeping a bicycle.
The hotel's swimming pool should be praised. The experience of facing the Erhai Lake is really a must. Swimming lovers must come to check in.
The only thing that is not ideal is the hotel's breakfast. Compared with the same brand of Shuiyue Zhouzhuang Pullman, the variety is slightly less, and the taste is not good enough.

In particular, I recommend the hotel's breakfast, which is rich in variety and delicious.

It can be said that this breakfast can be eaten at least twice without repeating the same. The location of the hotel is also very good. It is very close to the Xingsheng Bridge, a scenic spot. It takes 5 minutes to walk there. There are many car rental shops nearby. Convertible cars and electric bicycles are easy to rent! Therefore, if you come to Dali next time, Junfa Pullman is definitely the first choice!

msg:Dali booked two different room types of Pullman in 5 days, a deluxe double bed and a selected lake view double bed. The latter has a window sill with tatami mats and a good view. The price is a little higher than the former, but it is worth it !
This time, I also booked two different homestays in 5 days. The price is the same as the selected lake view room, but there is still a big difference in terms of hardware and sanitation. I, who is afraid of insects and slightly cleanliness, will consider it when I come to Dali next time. Full hotel.

There is also Dali Pullman's very considerate butler service. Thank you Coco for the reception and the answers to various questions. It makes people feel at home. It is different from the official service, but it has a sense of proportion. Probably a feature of Dali Pullman. (I have lived in Pullman Sanya, it is a different service)
In short, while the hotel is still very new, come and experience it
(The hotel gym has a full set of Technogym, and the view is also very good! Although playing is quite tiring, I still want to come to exercise haha)

I was still struggling with the B&B recommended by my friends who didn't book in advance
Thinking about finding a hotel to live in first.
I didn't expect such a great value. The room is very big and the bed is very soft haha
The housekeeper is very considerate, giving fruit and drinks
See me chatting with my family and say it's easy to do here
Offer to send a humidifier to the room
The buffet and the star bar on the 25th floor are also very good

msg:The reservation itself included two breakfasts, and when I added an extra bed to the room, I paid for an extra breakfast. As a result, I was asked again and again every day when I went to eat and said that there were only two. It was really annoying. Can't I make a note? I have nothing to do but explain to you how many breakfasts there are? In addition, the front desk is also very funny. The lake view room I booked was given to a very low floor. I thought about it and let it go without saying anything. However, when I checked in and checked out, they actually told me twice that they would upgrade me from a regular room to a lake view room. The one with the view room told lies with his eyes open. It was disgusting. When checking out, he almost had to charge a 300 upgrade fee. It was really ridiculous.

msg:I went to Dali with my girlfriends for free travel, and I was entangled in booking a B&B or a hotel, and finally chose to settle in Pullman. The experience of the three nights is summarized as follows:
1. The hotel is facing the Erhai Lake cruise ship pier. The sea view can only be seen from a distance. The low-floor one just sees some messy wharf gates, which is a bit sorry for the price of 1,500 a night.
2. The hotel can only score 4 points out of 5 points for breakfast. The waiter is anxious to clear the plate before the guests have finished their meal. In addition, because I am used to eating toast for breakfast and need butter, the kitchen probably made a mistake on the second day of check-in, and all the light butter was put out.
3. Coco at the front desk is very nice. She added WeChat in advance and provided a very detailed guide for visiting Dali. I am very grateful for her warm and thoughtful service after staying for 3 nights.
4. The cross-bridge rice noodle in the hotel's Chinese restaurant is really amazing. I recommend everyone to try it. It can be said to be a double enjoyment of vision and taste.
5. The room is spacious and comfortable. The wet and dry separation mattress is moderately soft and hard. It is also equipped with a humidifier and Bluetooth audio.

Mary called me one day in advance and sent me an 82-page Dali travel guide. I suddenly felt that it was a pity that I didn’t stay here when I first arrived in Dali! After that, we upgraded to a sea view room on the 15th floor, where we could see Dali Port.
There was also a surprise point. I didn’t notice the starry sky bar on the top floor before coming. After arriving, I was surprised to see the night view of Dali city and Xingsheng Bridge in a great position.
Free mini bar and capsule coffee are also provided in the room.
It is very suitable for people who want to watch the sea quietly away from the hustle and bustle of the ancient city attractions

In terms of service - the staff is warm and thoughtful. Special thanks to the welcome ambassador, Susie, who contacted us in advance to confirm the room requirements before check-in. After check-in, we learned that we will return to the plane in the evening, and specially arranged afternoon tea in the executive corridor for us, which is a good example for our itinerary.

Environment: Even if it is a low floor, it gives a room type with a large bay window. The scenery outside the window is pleasant and comfortable. You can sit in a daze on the bay window.

Breakfast: The restaurant does not have enough space, you may have to sit outside. There are many choices, and the master of bait silk will give a brief introduction.

Overall very satisfied, must stay in Dali.

The only regret is that the service of the hotel restaurant is relatively rigid, and it would be more perfect if it can flexibly handle the needs of guests.

However, it rained heavily in the early hours of the second night and I found out that only the 10th floor bay window had a glass platform sticking out. The sound of rain hitting the glass platform was heard. It was so big that I couldn't sleep for the whole second half of the night. Then I went down to take a look during the day and found that only the 10th floor had a protruding glass platform, and there were none on other floors. I was kind enough to say that I could upgrade for free. In fact, the worst floor was given to me. I'm sorry. As a star hotel, this approach can only be said to be disgusting. I will never recommend it.

There is a smart toilet. The large floating platform is very wide and long, just enough for the children to sleep with a quilt (my baby is 9 years old and sleeps very spaciously). It's a pity that I can only live on the 7th floor. Dali Port blocks part of the line of sight, and the room is not wide enough to see the sea~

The location is right next to Dali Port. It is very convenient to go on a cruise. It is walking distance to Erhai Park and Xingsheng Bridge. However, the surrounding area is a bit noisy, but it is difficult to have both convenience and quietness.

The service is warm. Although the Chinese restaurant is not cheap, the portion and taste are also very good. Guests who stay in the hotel can get a 10% discount. The rooftop bar has a first-class view, but the afternoon tea was a bit long to wait, but they took the initiative to give the children fruit juice. The breakfast is not rich but it’s worth it. Although there are many people, the queues are arranged in an orderly manner.

After many consultations on the fourth day of the ***** New Year, it showed that we were indeed in a difficult situation, so we made a late check-out for us, thank you. 3. The room facilities are all there should be, just like a standard five-star hotel. Then the slots began 1. On the first day, someone called and asked us about the details of our stay. I also said that Pullman is not bad. Including asking about children who said they would prepare slippers for us. On the day of check-in, the front desk asked all the questions again, and said to prepare slippers, but there were still no slippers in the room. When we were about to go out for almost an hour, we had to call again. In fact, I needed to solve the problem of adding water to the humidifier more urgently. Dali was really dry, and I was dumbfounded by the electricity. (Water will be installed in advance in the house where I lived before). Later, when I saw the staff who came, I went directly to the toilet to refill the water. I said that you are busy during the Spring Festival, and you knew that adding this kind of water would be better than me. 2. During the Spring Festival, it is difficult to take a taxi in Dali, and no one accepts an appointment at the airport. Go to the front desk to inquire. Around five or six in the afternoon, the front desk said that they have a fleet and can help me inquire about the price, and then tell me the price and reply me. No one replied to me until 10 o'clock that night. We were worried about missing the flight the next day and had no choice but to find a car bag for a long time. Someone called us that night to ask about our situation. I sort of forgot what he asked was a standard greeting. Overall, most of the staff you encounter at Pullman feel like robots, with standardized training but no heart. I don't care too much. They seemed very enthusiastic at the end of the day. 3. In addition, I will not talk about the details of the big queue for breakfast, the lack of rich breakfast, and even the sudden lack of water for washing at night. There are others. Anyway, everything can be justified by the large number of people during the Spring Festival. But before the epidemic, we traveled to many cities every year for parent-child travel during the Spring Festival, and we would stay in the most convenient five-star brand hotels in the local area. Dali Pullman really impressed me the most. But all in all it should be good. After all, I still saw several similar ones nearby. His family has the best evaluation. So make up your mind. Maybe other houses are not as good as his. Maybe after the Spring Festival, the sincerity of the staff has returned. .

msg:Check in again at the Pullman Dali Junfa Hotel. There will be many check-in spots around the hotel. About 450 meters away from the hotel, there will be an online celebrity check-in point Xingsheng Bridge. Opposite the hotel is Dali Port, which is convenient for transportation and travel. What makes people feel most at home is the items and services experienced in the hotel, which feels very warm.
The hotel room was received by Jeffer, the director of housekeeping at the time of check-in. When the occupancy rate was particularly high, he also helped to check in himself. After finishing the check-in, he rushed back to the room to work. He felt that he had received a lot of attention and the experience was very good. The room I arranged was on the 21st floor, with a wide view and a sweeping view of the Erhai Lake. The hotel's facilities and equipment are very new, there is a large bathtub, and the minibar has a lot of drinks. Overall, I am very satisfied. When using afternoon tea and happy hour in the executive lounge, the three little girls Tara, Beata, and Mary served very meticulously. When I left the hotel, Rick, the concierge supervisor, helped me see off, and Eason, the front desk supervisor, helped coordinate my colleagues to assist me in completing the travel plan.


Western restaurant, this time I ate a western restaurant late buffet, just in time for the festival, many people came here admiringly, the new service manager Lizzie was very enthusiastic, and helped to reserve a seat in advance, the variety of tastes is suitable for all guests, in I am very satisfied that there is no waiting for a seat during the peak occupancy period. The location was arranged by the window, quiet and comfortable. Chef Xue received him personally and felt very caring. The seafood was very fresh and the barbecue was very tender. Western-style shredded pork is really thoughtful for people like me who don't like spicy food!


In the Chinese restaurant, what I remember most is the last time I used the a la carte happy hour produced by the Chinese restaurant. There are hot soup, Xuanwei stir-fried pork, raw stir-fried crispy cabbage, small pot rice noodles and fruit plate, all of which taste very delicious Kekou, Chef Zheng, the head chef of the Chinese restaurant, asked about the dining experience and suggestions for improvement. He was very considerate and careful. In the corridor of the Chinese restaurant, there are decorative walls piled up with blue tiles. There is also a lake-view terrace in the private rooms, which is decorated with tie-dye.


The starry sky bar on the 25th floor is half indoor and half outdoor. The environment is good, the a**osphere is very good, the scenery is beautiful, and you can take pictures casually. You can eat snacks and drinks on it. If necessary, there are very powerful bartenders to help The bartending water, because I don't drink too much, I finally ordered a drink, which was fresh and delicious, and I was extremely satisfied. I personally think that the starry sky bar in the evening will be more beautiful than the evening one. You can see the group photos of the Internet celebrity Xingsheng Bridge, the sunset and the Erhe River. This is not available in the hotels around the Erhai Lake. It is so worth checking in!


This time I visited a lot of new hotels in Yunnan, and also settled in some old teams repeatedly. I found that whether it is a new hotel or an old one, I can meet many familiar excellent team members from local or other provinces, such as this hotel Pullman Hotel Dali. Whether it is the first-line operation team or the second- and third-line support depar**ents, they are all built from the good teams I have lived in before. Here, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks and respect to them and their old team.
During the period of staying in Dali Junfa Pullman twice after a few months, I experienced many international and domestic teams. Some of the cases were shocking. For example, Lijiang Tinghe made things difficult for the official reservation in order to delist In order to force customers to cancel their complaints, Chuxiong, the capital of music in Europe, did not hesitate to find staff from relevant agencies, but was denied education by the staff. Lugu Lake edited information several times to deliberately portray low-scoring customers as too demanding. I occupied the moral high ground and was ridiculed by other teams. Banna Splashing Square Music City revealed that the room night did not act and repost, but every time I responded to the evaluation and said empty words every time. Own. These situations are enough to show that the good of a team is inseparable from the good of each individual in each depar**ent. In this area of Yunnan, there are many teams, especially in some domestic affiliate groups, the good ones are very good, and the bad ones are very bad, with a large variance.
Therefore, when you come to Yunnan in the future, you must look for hotels operated by old teams with good reputation, because the human factor in the check-in experience plays a vital role in the overall experience, such as the current excellent Dali Junfa Pullman team , I hope they will make persistent efforts and continue to be excellent.

I'm surprised by Eleven and Anna's service attitude, especially Anna's super five-star manager quality , Because the heating temperature was a little high on the first day of check-in (our family members are more afraid of heat), we immediately arranged to upgrade the room type, send gifts, and feel the warmth of home.

msg:I stayed at Pullman for two nights in Dali, and the overall experience was very good.
Location: very good! Urban area + Erhai Lake, you can see the Erhai Lake from the window, and you can eat out when you walk around. Especially when you go to Shuanglang later, you will find that Xiaguan is more standardized, and the prices are really touching.

hotel room:
a. The space is very large. There are enough boxes for two people. I feel that two more boxes are enough. There are tatami mats by the window, the bathroom is large, and the space division is reasonable.
b. The air conditioner is very warm and there is a bathtub. You can ask the guest room for bath bags and bath salts. Toiletries are non-disposable, and you can also ask for one-time use from the guest room, which is very convenient and fast.

Breakfast: There are a lot of diners during the peak period. The hotel will inform you of the peak time in advance as a reminder. The type of breakfast is okay, quite satisfactory, and the taste is also good. It is worth mentioning that the service staff are very enthusiastic, and they did not show up when facing so many guests It is very satisfying when you need to wait for a meal.

It is very worthwhile to find a hotel to book a chartered car service for travel! ! ! The driver, Master Yang, is clean in the car and enthusiastically explaining. He is very professional. He picked us up on time and planned the itinerary reasonably. Excellent!
The most comfortable thing is that no matter what scenic spot, no matter how many tourists there are, Master Yang can pick us up at the closest place. According to the master's instructions, the journey is comfortable and there is no turning back. We stop and go without being tired at all.

Service: I thought that many tourists would be too busy during the peak period, but in fact the experience was very good. Ms. Mary of the hotel called one day in advance, asked about the room preference, arranged a free pick-up, and also sent two cocktails at the starry sky bar. The whole process was enthusiastic , patience, and will pay attention to experience feedback in the later stage, very satisfied!

Starry Sky Bar: The Starry Sky Bar has a good environment, a good a**osphere, and a good view. The bartender is very good. He can perfectly prepare a glass of wine with complicated requirements. I am very satisfied. It is recommended to let the bartender do his best when ordering wine. Special and worth it.

Chinese restaurant: I dined in the restaurant twice, and I ordered dishes for dinner. The taste is normal Yunnan cuisine (but we are not very used to it), and the food is served slowly. tasty! But the speed of serving the food was really too slow. The waiter sent a stack of beef to express his apology, but hoped that it would be better to serve the rice noodles faster.

To sum up: I am very satisfied overall, it is a relatively satisfactory journey, and I will be willing to stay in Pullman again when I come to Dali.

I entrusted the hotel to arrange a business car to pick up the airport. There are too many luggages. The first day of vacation starts to take off Arriving at the destination Dali, encountering a strong wind in Dali, circling in the air for half a day, unable to land and then flying back to the starting point, Felix, the concierge of the hotel, took the trouble to adjust and arrange the pick-up time of the driver time and time again. From morning to night, he was rejected The service professionalism of the hotel staff is touching and warm. Arriving at the hotel in the early morning, the front desk check-in welcomes the ambassador manager Kiros Zhu Jiale, handles it as quickly as possible and helps to send all the luggage to the room. Every day when you check in, you will call to remind and arrange the time during the afternoon tea and dinner at the hotel. When you check out It was still early to go to the airport at night for the ticket. Susie Cao thoughtfully arranged for the 21st floor executive corridor to have a rest. Xiao Xiao greeted me on the 21st floor corridor and packed some food before I left. When I was eating food on the plane, I was warmed up. It was the first time I went out on vacation after the opening, and the Pullman Hotel felt like home everywhere. Everything was responded to and implemented. The staff at Pullman said that they would book Pullman again without hesitation next time they go to Dali. I wish Pullman a prosperous business and 2023 will be even more prosperous.

After learning that we were celebrating our wedding anniversary, he helped us upgrade the room type, furnished the room, and arranged a small cake. Big praise! The hotel is less than half an hour away from the airport, and it takes about half an hour to drive to the ancient city. I personally think it is very convenient to live here as long as you drive by yourself. Not long after it opened, the environment is also very new, and the swimming pool and Starry Sky Bar have an invincible view. In short, everything is very satisfactory, and I will definitely stay here next time.

This time I lived in Pullman, Ms. Angel called me early and asked if I had any other needs for the room. From check-in to check-out, the service staff inside and out are very good 👍 The first-line sea view, the location is really great! Downstairs is the Xingsheng Bridge. The hotel's breakfast is also delicious! There are many options, both Chinese and Western! What I especially like is that there are so many kinds of bread! There are also various Dali snacks to try.

All in all, it was a very good experience, and I will choose Pullman next time I come to Dali.

The pictures were beautiful, but I still missed the standardization of large hotels. There will definitely be unsatisfactory places in hotel facilities and management. The next day, I chose Pullman near Erhai Park. The view of the lake view room is amazing. The sunset and the sunrise are completely captured. After checking in, I added Doris WeChat, the housekeeper, and the service was really considerate. For the first time, I felt that a five-star hotel felt a lot of warmth in addition to its excellent facilities and quality. After seeing the Erhai Lake in Dali, the hotel has a lot of food nearby. It is very convenient to go to the airport and the station. The decoration is also very new. The most satisfying accommodation is really worth the price! !

After playing for a week, I have stayed all over from Santorini to Shuanglang to Xizhou to the ancient city of Dali and the famous Internet celebrity hotels in the urban area. Although there are places with unique style, but In the end, the one that made me feel most comfortable was Junfa Pullman. It was also because it was the last day to arrive here. The whole thing was very enthusiastic. Leo, the housekeeper in charge of me, could directly communicate with him about all hotel-related issues. It was very convenient. He also upgraded the sea view room for us. The price is more affordable than similar high-end online red stores. There are quite a few, but the most important thing is the comfort that you can relax after playing for a week. I recommend this place as the end of your trip to Dali, and the last place to rest before leaving Dali. The nucleic acid point is also very close. As long as you can think of anything, you can make requests to the hotel. Unfortunately, the schedule is tight and I didn't catch up with the starry sky and breakfast.

Environment: The location is very good, there is nucleic acid across the street, quiet music, faint aroma, what a star hotel should look like
Service: Very, very satisfied, especially the housekeeper Beata, all kinds of tips before check-in from temperature to arrival time, early check-in, late check-out, etc. I felt the star service before I checked in. After checking in, the room provided ice cubes, buckwheat pillows, and a mask from the night room service on the last night. I lost a room card in the middle, and the front desk took the initiative to help make it up, and comforted me not to worry. There is no need to carry luggage by yourself, in short, very very satisfied

🚨 I am particularly dissatisfied with the hotel's air conditioner. On the first day, two engineers came to check it and said that it was good to cheer up. After 10 minutes, it became cold. As a result, I was woken up by the heat in the middle of the night, and I couldn’t fix it until I came back to play during the day. Later, I said it was because the main switch of the air conditioner was not turned on, but it was finally turned on, and then I was woken up again by the heat in the middle of the night. Sorry to ask again! Too hard for two fat guys!

4. Turndown service every night, usually from 6 to 8 pm, the guest room will be rearranged again, and the hotel will attach a thoughtful little gift beside the bed

The service was very nice, especially praised Mary (Xiao Yang), who contacted me in advance from the morning of the check-in day, informed me that the room was ready, and invited me to taste the afternoon tea in the executive lounge, and helped me with the toiletries the next day. I bought it, and then sent me to the door of the hotel when I checked out. I felt the warm and considerate service throughout the whole process.
4. There is a nucleic acid testing point at the entrance of Dali Port across the road from the hotel, but crossing the road is more dangerous, and you need to detour to the traffic light to pass.
5. The breakfast is ok. I ate lunch in the Chinese restaurant once. The taste is ok.
Disadvantages: There is no menu in the room, I hope to increase it; there is no price list for the facilities in the room, only trouble the waiter to ask, it is not convenient to buy some things.

msg:Straight to the point, I like this Pullman very much. The hotel is very new and the scenery is excellent. The most important thing in a hotel for guests is service. It is rare to encounter that almost all personnel are well trained. Even if there are some situations, colleagues from different depar**ents of the hotel will quickly put out the fire and solve the problem. This time, the room was booked through Ctrip. The hotel will call in advance to confirm the specific requirements of the guest for the room, and add a special person to communicate with WeChat at any time, and it turns out that the feedback speed is very fast, and the PDF version of the Dali play guide is very considerate . On the day of check-in, inform through WeChat in advance that the room and fruit plate are ready. The day before check-out, you will also call to ask if you need to check out late, whether there is a need for a car, and whether you need to issue an invoice, so the work can be prepared in advance, and the entire check-in The experience is smooth.
        At the time of check-in, due to the current requirement from the Dali community to the hotel, the guests are required to show a 24-hour nucleic acid report. Due to the problem of the Yunnan health code system, it was not displayed on the same day. If the new staff at the front desk encounters a situation that cannot be handled, senior staff will take the initiative to come to solve the problem. Provide a feasible plan that does not affect the guest's stay and does not violate the community regulations, flexible and professional. During this stay, Susie, who has been communicating with me through WeChat, was very enthusiastic and professional throughout the whole process, including before check-in and after check-out, and gave prompt and timely feedback. After checking out, due to the need for electronic invoices, I requested different versions successively, and they were all resolved very quickly. It also shows that the communication between the various depar**ents of the hotel is smooth, and the entire hotel is advancing on the premise of the needs and feelings of the guests.
        The hotel is located in Xiaguan District, facing Cangshan and Erhai Lake, just across the road from Dali Port, and the landscape is very open and beautiful. The facilities are very new, there are different pillow choices, enough socket pipes, enough bathroom space, and double basins are very convenient.
        Traveling to Dali usually involves chartering a car or self-driving. Compared with the distance to various attractions, I will pay more attention to whether the room is large, whether the sound insulation is good, and whether the bedding and linen can make me rest well. The biggest difference between hotels and homestays is that Whether there are enough staff to serve the guests to solve all possible problems, and whether the staff has enough professional and meticulous operation standards, so if it is a family trip with children or a business traveler, Dali Pullman is almost Full marks selected.
        The epidemic has been back and forth for so long, and people all over the country are suffocated and want to travel. Dali is a very good tourist destination. This time I went all the way to Jianchuan, Shaxi, Xizhou and Dali, and saw many beautiful pictures. To many wonderful people, I hope all tourists have a satisfactory journey. Thanks to Susie at the last stop at Pullman Dali, the front desk manager of the night shift, the lady who took us out after check-out, the polite and polite concierge brother and concierge lady. , The housekeeper who will greet you in the corridor will greet you warmly, and look forward to meeting again next time.

It is considered to be very heart-warming in domestic luxury hotels! So I renew the room 2 times in a row. I especially like Yilia, who asked me if I had any special requirements before I arrived at the hotel that day, and cared about our needs in every possible way during my stay! So when I come to Dali, I will choose Pullman without hesitation. Because the experience of Pullman Hotel is also a plus point for this trip to Dali. ❤️❤️

msg:Junfa Pullman in Dali should be the most satisfying hotel for my trip to Dali. Although it is a typical business hotel, the sea view is not inferior to a resort hotel. What impresses me most is every service staff in the hotel. From the moment they got off the bus, it shows that the hotel's training is in place, and each staff is of high quality. Going upstairs, going downstairs, getting in the car, including calling the customer service room at one or two o'clock in the middle of the night, are basically answered in seconds, which is so touching. The phone never made the guest wait more than 10 seconds at any time. Very satisfied! ! ! Thanks to all the staff! ! ! The breakfast is also very exquisite and delicious! Everyone here does not neglect anything, basically they are responsive, and immediately. One hundred thousand likes! The bar on the top floor is very comfortable!

It turned out that the choice was quite right, the food was delicious, and the hotel staff were also warm and generous. , there is a need to do it immediately, it is very good to be able to do this in the summer peak season!

msg:The little brother and sister at the front desk of the first hotel I came to Yunnan were really warm and enthusiastic. Miss Molly was beautiful, cute and warm. Doris and Leo were also really great. They helped us with our luggage and upgraded the room. They escorted us to the hotel and escorted us all the way to the hotel. The drinks in the minibar also made us very enthusiastic about where to go in Yunnan, made us a guide and sent it to us.
As soon as I arrived at the room, my eyes were attracted by the lake view. The first line of Erhai Lake was imprinted into my eyes. It was really shocking.
In particular, I want to say that the hotel has a spiral staircase that leads directly to the restaurant. The most memorable thing is that the rice noodles in the hotel are so delicious. They are the best rice noodles I have ever eaten. I even ate two and my stomach was bloated to death.
And the grade standard of the hotel is definitely not allowed for more than 1,000 prices
I really like it. I want to stay a few more times next time
I will come to Molly to book a room in the future
By the way, I forgot my ID. Molly called and told us. Really moved.

msg:I came to Yunnan for more than ten days, and traveled to Lijiang Shangri-La, Lugu Lake and Dali. Thanks to Pullman for the ultimate good impression, I booked an executive lake view room. The room is spacious and clean, the scenery is also great, the breakfast is rich, and the children like the daytime best. Soak in the swimming pool, the staff brothers and sisters will accompany and play, and there is an uncle who just transferred from Beijing, who also instructed his brother's swimming skills, which is especially good👍🏻. In particular, I would like to thank Miss Bella at the front desk for her warm reception. I missed the dinner time in the executive lounge once, and I specially called the chef back to prepare steak pasta for the children. It warms my heart and has already recommended it to my friends. Now, next time I come to Dali, I will choose Pullman~

Looking at Erhai Lake in the room is so pleasant.

I booked a late stay in Dali, and the boutique B&Bs were full. I had no intention of staying in the newly opened one. Booked an executive sea view room, which was unexpectedly good.
Special thanks to CoCo in the executive lounge, who is kind-hearted and has warm and thoughtful service. The later itinerary plans to change to Pullman again, but unfortunately the rooms are full.
Dali family travel, recommended hotel.

The beauties at the front desk are very gentle and attentive, very polite and have a nice and refreshing voice; the guys in the lobby are very meticulous and take the initiative to take care of us in every aspect; the sanitation and cleaning customer service is very patient, will provide fresh fruits, etc., and will arrange our messy things neatly .
Super super nice, I will stay here when I go to Dali in the future, I will go to Molly, Wu Yumin and hotel services.

msg:The lake view room has a beautiful view, and the room facilities are also very new. The only bug is that the food and beverages can't keep up. There are few varieties of breakfast, and there are only three kinds of fruits every day. The watermelon tastes very bad. Whether there are basic apples and bananas, it can be said that it is worse than the Holiday Inn's breakfast. The Chinese restaurant for dinner tastes good, but the food was very slow to serve twice, and it took about 2 hours to finish 5 dishes. The scenery of the hotel is absolutely good. If you don't live in Shuanglang, this is the best choice. The transportation is convenient and the service is very considerate. Looking to improve the catering to keep up with the Pullman brand

Who would have thought that the hotel carefully prepared a small cake for us as soon as we entered the room. I was really touched! The overall equipment of the room is very new. The smart toilet, intelligent robot delivery takeaway, constant temperature swimming pool, and the night view on the top floor are a complete mess. The location is also very good, just opposite Dali Port. I used to stay in B&Bs when I went to Dali, but this time I felt that no matter which five-star hotel I went to, it was yyds!

The most outrageous thing is that one day the fire alarm suddenly sounded loudly in the room, and I called I didn't know it was a drill until I called. Why didn't you call in advance to notify us of the drill? What if someone thought the hotel was on fire and fled in a hurry, causing a secondary disaster? Simply outrageous. I stayed before the epidemic started. The price-performance ratio of more than 800 yuan was barely good, but I will definitely choose another hotel next time. Later, I heard that the price increased during the Spring Festival and it was even more unworthy. Don’t be taken advantage of.

msg:Initial impression: The hotel is relatively new, and the decoration is simple and unpleasant. You need to swipe your card to get up and down the elevator to the guest room~ Safe! The room layout is reasonable and clean! The view from the window is great! The feeling of looking at Erhai Lake from high altitude is more charming~Recommended experience

Experience after stay:
Praise: 1: The air conditioner in the hotel is very quiet, and I, a person who has difficulty falling asleep, did not hear the sound of the air conditioner. This is definitely a plus!
2: Bella, the front office manager of the hotel, is very good. He often recommends our local delicacies and fun places. Many times, after get off work, he still asks whether the guests have chosen a delicious place today! Let's have a sense of being home, thank you! During the 4 days of our stay, my family and I were very satisfied with our service, so we stayed for 2 more days! Once I wanted to thank her face to face, and went to the lobby to find out that she was resting that day, but even when she was resting, she still sent messages in the morning to recommend us places to eat and play! sincere gratitude!

3: Thank you to everyone who met the hotel staff during the 4-day stay. Your impression on me is really great. What makes me sigh is how a leader manages such an excellent team, and every employee works so hard ! The customer service is meticulous and full of energy! In addition to the hardware facilities, the success of a hotel is the management of the whole set and the conscientious implementation of the reward and punishment mechanism!
I hope the hotel will get better and better and become a benchmark for the entire industry! The last thank you is for the leader of the hotel!
The most thanks I have said is also my heartfelt thanks and recognition!

What needs to be improved: The hotel's breakfast can be a little more distinctive and add a little local snacks. The breakfast bait is delicious, but I want to change it every day!
The western pastry for breakfast is commendable for doing a good job! It reflects the level of star hotel!
Evening buffet: the durian cake is really delicious😋, and the prawns are also very fresh🦐:-) The overall is quite satisfactory!

After checking in, I highly recommend everyone to experience it! Whoops! Why have you written so many long comments for the first time! 🌹🍀

msg:I have traveled to many cities and spent most of the year in hotels. This time, the Dali Pullman made a deep impression on me. In addition to the good infrastructure of Accor, more of the memory comes from the warm service of the staff. The meticulousness and thoughtfulness give people a warm feeling. It can be said that staying in the hotel for so many years has once again refreshed my perception of being at home. .
I was lucky enough to know the manager of the lounge Coco who took my order. From the perspective of the guests, he introduced the details and characteristics of the hotel completely. As small as the pillow, you have to ask. The perfect check-in and preparation, as well as the unexpected care, surpassed the beauty of Dali and was the most unforgettable experience of my trip.
When I renewed my stay, because Ctrip had an event, although the booked Miss Angel was not the person in charge of my order, she also explained the details of the event to me earnestly and enthusiastically over and over again, which not only allowed me to stay in a satisfactory room, but also saved money. Some.
Some of the other hotels in the hotel that I can't name are all very attentive, warm and thoughtful. I made an appoin**ent with a friend to come back to Pullman Dali in July. Compared with the scenery, it is the real travel experience to have such a good hotel service.
I came to Dali with emotions and was influenced by gentleness and meticulousness. Maybe it was emotional, or I didn’t know enough. As I only watched Sofitel before, I would like to call Dali Pullman the light of the hotel.

The water in the shower room is very large, and the smart toilet is the basic condition for people to feel more comfortable.

In addition, the room has a wide field of vision, you can see the Erhai Lake at close range, and the Dali Port is just across the road, so it is very convenient to take a sightseeing cruise. In addition, the hotel&#39;s buffet breakfast is also very good. There are also other hotels in Guowu Hotel. There is also Dali&#39;s characteristic &quot;rake meat bait&quot;, which is worth a try. It is safe to say that I will stay here next time I come to Dali!

msg:A five-star luxury hotel. Traveling with my wife, I am not familiar with the situation in Dali. It took a lot of time to book a hotel. I saw many Internet celebrity hotels and felt that it was not suitable for the elderly. In the end, I still feel that all aspects of the global chain brand hotel are guaranteed. After the actual check-in, it is really good, newly opened, and the health services are very good. Not to mention the environment, the hotel is located in the southernmost part of Erhai Lake, just a few steps away from the Internet celebrity attraction &quot;Xingsheng Bridge&quot;, as well as the Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture Museum. In addition, it is the middle point between Haixi and Haidong. It is great to travel around Erhai Lake from east to west. Before going, I contacted the hotel by phone, and Tracy answered the call from the reservation depar**ent. Tracy was very warm and thoughtful. We not only did a good job of requesting the room, but also upgraded us to a deluxe executive sea view king bed at the front desk after arriving. (We originally booked the deluxe sea view double room) The floor is higher and the view is very good. The lady at the front desk was very gentle and took us to our room. The room was quiet during the stay and the bedding was comfortable. Fruits were also presented. There is evening service every evening and the aunties are very attentive. The professional quality of the front desk staff is very good, and they take the initiative to greet each time they go in and out. When it was time to check out, both the reservation depar**ent Tracy and the front desk took the initiative to ask if they wanted to check out late or help with luggage? The breakfast is also good, there are special snacks rice noodles and bait silk every day. In a word, the Pullman brand is the guarantee of our choice, and the Pullman Dali Junfa Hotel interprets this brand very well! We sighed that it was the right choice.

The bar on the 25th floor, the location is great, the view is invincible, I hope there are good DJs to do some good parties to play;

The breakfast is acceptable, the buffet on Saturday night, the seafood is acceptable, the room service is only noodles and noodles, and the pasta is called, which is very general;

The lady at the front desk, the room cleaning aunt, and the boys in the concierge are all friendly and the service is in place. When we left the store, Miss Poppy, the duty manager, personally pushed the luggage cart and took us to the underground parking lot. Thank you very much, see you again if you have the opportunity.

Affected by the epidemic, there are not many people on the Dragon Boat Festival, parking is not crowded, and breakfast is not crowded.

Dali's hotel options are only Pullman and Indigo. The landscape has its own advantages and disadvantages.
But Pullman wins in the new equipment and the design of the service room is also very reasonable
Especially the bar on the top floor is great for watching the sunset
Rice noodles for breakfast are also good
In particular, I commend Bella at the front desk for being very patient and introducing me when I checked in. She also warmly told me about Dali's food and attractions, which really helped me in this trip.
Next time I come to Dali, Pullman should only be my only choice

msg:The location of the room is very good, the bathing area is very large, and the room is highly automated. There is a switch next to the bed. Press the curtain to automatically open to reveal the beautiful Erhai Lake. It feels very good. The bathtub is simple. Super photogenic! The bedding is very comfortable, and with the super blackout curtains, I don't even want to wake up until I sleep~ The spiral staircase in the lobby is full of design. The hotel's supporting facilities are well done. Before check-in, Beata called to contact us to inquire about the needs. The arrangements are very satisfactory and will come again.

msg:🚗 Transportation: It is very close to the Xingsheng Bridge, and the Dali Port is downstairs, so it is very convenient to travel
🍃Environment: The overall decoration is low-key yet exquisite, which makes people very comfortable. The breakfast on the second floor and the buffet in the evening are very rich. I prefer the starry sky on the roof. Drink tea in the afternoon, have a drink in the evening, and watch the night view It's all good, the infinity pool is also great, the water is very clean, and you can go there at six in the morning🏊‍♀️
🧹Sanitation: clean and tidy, room attendants clean very carefully
🔔Service: The staff of the hotel are very enthusiastic. Doris, who received us, is caring and meticulous, and has a cheerful personality.

The overall impression of this hotel is quite good. The area that can be improved is probably that a young female employee was walking crookedly because of foot pain when using the buffet, and lost some professionalism.

The renovation period is too old, the fountain landscape is useless, the hotel hardware is slightly outdated, and many services have been shut down due to the impact of the epidemic, so the feeling is average. In comparison, staying at Pullman is a bright spot. The hotel's decoration, hardware, bathroom and bedding are all exquisite, and the quality of the restaurant's food is also good. The front desk of the entire hotel, including the service staff, were courteous and smiling, especially the housekeeper Tara, who was also warm and thoughtful and provided us with careful service. The baby bath, the baby tub and the toys and the big tub all keep my two babies happy. I hope the hotel can maintain this quality of service. If I go to Dali next time, Pullman will be my best choice.

Location: Dali Port, count Xiaguan, it is also convenient to take a taxi to other places
Facilities: new hotel, facilities are relatively new, the setting is more reasonable
Service: The overall service is in line with standard services. Beata, the executive lounge, will call before check-in to inquire about the check-in time requirements. During the check-in period, she is also very enthusiastic to solve the problems encountered, which is great! It's just that the service of the full-time restaurant needs to be strengthened in March, and the concierge David service is also good
Restaurant: Juntingxuan Chinese restaurant is good. I think the taste is good in a star-rated hotel restaurant. The executive lounge is fixed according to the menu, which is really good for me.
Fitness facilities: It's really going to be faster, a full set of TECHNOGYM equipment, it's hard not to love, the swimming pool will go to experience next time
I hope to maintain it all the time, many hotels start well, and then slowly become normal!

As soon as you get off the bus, the concierge will take your luggage and send you to the room. The concierge Joe's service is thoughtful and professional, in the lobby. Sitting quietly for a while will automatically feel better. The service is super good. The location is very good. Even if you look at the same lake view during the day and night, you will feel a big difference. The room is very large, but the floor-to-ceiling glass is very good. Children play in the room, adults chat on the balcony, it is so comfortable. The pool is also nice and the kids had a great time. Across the road from Erhai Lake, it is not far from the ancient city of Dali and the airport. It is really convenient to travel by car. The surrounding is very prosperous and there are many choices for dining. Walking along the Erhai Lake after breakfast, it is very comfortable. The breakfast was great, the tableware was brightly coloured and the choice was plentiful. I didn't feel sick even after three days of eating. Overall, I am really satisfied, and I will sincerely recommend it to every friend who travels to Dali. The first choice is Junfa Pullman, your best choice.

It's actually quite interesting. We originally booked other hotels, but the hotel couldn't keep up with the physical discomfort, so we checked out early, and temporarily booked Pullman for 2 nights one day in advance.

Not long after the reservation, Bella called to greet us in advance, to understand the preference of moving in, and also upgraded the room type for us, introduced four or five kinds of pillows, and just changed the buckwheat pillow that my husband is used to.

In the lobby, Tara helped us settle in. We also added WeChat to introduce the hotel restaurant, functional rooms, nearby games, etc. in detail. Before leaving, we also took the initiative to ask if we needed to invoice, which was very gentle and considerate.

Finally, I want to say that the hotel facilities and facilities are very new, the parking lot is very bright, and the overall experience is very good. The dinner buffet restaurant is also the nearest Internet celebrity restaurant, and the 198 buffet is very cost-effective.

If there is a chance, I will choose to stay again~

msg:During the Spring Festival, I took my children and the elderly to Dali to bask in the sun. Due to personal hotel preferences, I abandoned the many Internet celebrity homestays in Dali and stayed at the newly opened Pullman Hotel for 6 days and 5 nights. After in-depth experience, I felt as follows:

🍃 Environment:

It is located in Xiaguan District, next to the Xingsheng Bridge in Dali City (that is, a special bridge), and opposite to Dali Port, so the view of the hotel's seaside room is very overbearing!
Frankly speaking, the hardware of Pullman is not luxurious. Compared with other Pullmans, the lobby of this hotel gives people a bright feeling. There is a beautiful spiral staircase on one side, and the lounge area where guests check in is also quite distinctive. The perfume smells pretty good too.
In terms of other facilities, the gym and swimming pool are quite satisfactory. The only downside is that there is no children's playground. If families with children choose a house hotel, it will be a little troublesome.
Overall, the hardware of this Pullman in Dali is not bad.

Room:

Our group booked two rooms, and we were lucky to be upgraded to an executive sea view room when we checked in (but did not enjoy executive courtesy). Although the housekeeper coco invited us to the executive lounge for afternoon tea, but due to personal travel reasons Come on, that's for a later story.

The decoration style of the whole room is modern and simple wooden style. Due to the new opening, all the facilities are very new. The sea-facing room type can see Dali Port and Erhai Lake completely unobstructed. Sitting on the bay window beside the bed, watching It is very pleasant to see Erhai Lake.

Room amenities are Pullman's own brand, and tea and capsule coffee are replenished daily. Children's equipment is also fully prepared, which is quite parent-child friendly

It is worth mentioning that Pullman's sleep system, you can choose the right pillow by yourself, call the guest room, and you can quickly get it.

Meals:

When staying in a hotel, we usually experience hotel meals. In addition to the normal daily breakfast, there will be afternoon tea, lounge and dinner if the opportunity arises.
Let’s talk about breakfast first: Pullman’s breakfast can be regarded as quite satisfactory. There are certain choices of Chinese and Western styles. When you sit down, you will ask if you want tea or coffee, which is quite professional. However, the actual eatability of the breakfast category is not so high, especially our resident guests, who will feel a little boring later.
This time, the afternoon tea and lounge were not experienced because of our personal itinerary, but we went to the high-altitude starry sky bar. Since smoking is allowed indoors, we also chose to give up with children intelligently, so we did not experience it.
For the dinner, we have a buffet dinner. The most eye-catching dishes are the seafood and western pastries. The overall taste is quite satisfactory, and it may be a bit boring for people who don't like seafood.

🔔Service:

The last thing to say is the hotel service, which is the most dazzling part of this stay. Before checking in, the colleagues in the executive lounge called us to confirm the itinerary, and we successfully enjoyed the hotel's airport pick-up service. There was welcome tea at check-in, coco in the executive lounge also sent us to the room, and wechat sent Dali's travel reference, helping us with the service throughout the whole process, which was very heart-warming.
It needs to be mentioned that during our stay, we encountered a water pipe leak in the room with a burst water pipe upstairs. We called the front desk and quickly gave us an empty room opposite us for us to go to rest. We also apologized the next day, and we could see the hotel. For the emphasis on guest experience, this deserves a lot of praise.

Overall, the Pullman selection this time was quite successful! It can be said that this Dali Pullman is a flagship.

There are tea rooms, executive lounges, gyms, swimming pools, and a special bar, which is very characteristic! The equipment is also brand new. Although it is newly opened, there is no smell of new decoration in the hotel, and it is very comfortable to live in. The most commendable thing is to welcome the ambassador, Bella. During the stay, Bella was very considerate and helped us solve many problems. At the same time, he carefully explained the tourist attractions and delicious restaurants in Dali and sent us the documents. Bella said that it was their concierge. The guy arranged it himself, this measure is very good, it is not easy to think of the unfamiliarity of us outsiders. The scenery of the hotel is also very beautiful. It is right by the Erhai Lake. In comparison, it is much better than the B&B in Dali.

In addition to the executive lounge, there is also a starry sky bar that makes people unforgettable. The scenery is simply unparalleled. The other is this service, the ceiling of the hotel industry. I was surprised to receive a call from the Executive Lounge prior to check-in asking about my room requirements. After arriving at the hotel, the bellman took the initiative to help with the luggage, and the ambassador and manager Bella gave a warm reception in person, and arranged for us very well. During the stay, Bella also answered questions. Dali Pullman said No. 2, no one should dare to say that he is No. 1

The meticulous care and concern of the welcome ambassador Bella makes people very comfortable, and the girls in the lounge, everyone speaks softly, making people reluctant to speak to them loudly. In a word, the name is also very gentle: Qian Qian, Qiao Qiao~ I can't help but sigh, isn't the standard for the lounge only recruiting cute and cute girls? Pullman.

Before checking in, I asked in advance which pillow is more comfortable to sleep in. I also gave you afternoon tea. It was very warm and thoughtful. I will choose Pullman Hotel when I come to Dali next time.

msg:I came to Yunnan with my boss on a business trip
Because the owner's accommodation requirements have been relatively high
It was found that the Pullman Hotel in Dali has just opened
Just booked to try it

First of all the service was great, especially Bella, the manager on duty that day
The service is warm and thoughtful, and also upgraded the lake view room for us, allowing us to appreciate the beauty of Cangshan and Erhai Lake

Although it is a newly opened hotel, the whole hotel and rooms have no peculiar smell, and the various supporting facilities are also very good.

Secondly, the breakfast dishes also taste good, even if they have local characteristics of Yunnan, they can also meet the tastes of most tourists.
I heard that the starry sky bar on the top floor is a special feature, but because this is a business trip, I don’t have time to experience it. Next time I come to Dali, I will definitely choose Pullman again~

msg:Rarely reviews hotels, but Pullman Dali is worth talking about. Seeing that there are thousands of homestays in Dali, I decided to choose traditional luxury five-star for the same price. It turned out to be a worthy hotel.
1. The location and landscape are invincible. In the core area of Xiaguan near the wharf, the facilities are very convenient. There is a supermarket downstairs and Yangbi Street next to it. There are a lot of food. It has a sea view of the bay area and the landscape is very good;
2. The facilities are relatively new. The hotel opened in 2021 will not have the outdated feeling of the old hotel, and it has done a good job in all aspects of sanitation and maintenance.
3. The best thing about this store is the service. My one-to-one butler Bella made arrangements for the whole process from before our check-in to after our check-in, which made people feel attentive and considerate, reflecting the due service quality; The concierge, swimming pool front desk, etc. are all cordial communication with service emotions. In every aspect, we can feel that this is a luxury hotel with good training and strong sense of service.
4. Shortcomings: There are too few breakfast categories, which are a bit inconsistent with the standards of luxury hotels. It is recommended to increase the choice of dishes, especially the breakfast options with Dali characteristics

The room was very clean, and the view of Erhai Lake outside the window was particularly beautiful, but I always thought that the most beautiful thing in Dali was the clouds. For such a beautiful scenery, I must come back to the hotel again!

Let's talk about the satisfied aspects first:
1. The lake view room has a good view, and I encountered a rainbow in the lounge
2. The concierge and the restaurant have thoughtful service, the hotel's car rental service is excellent, the driver of the team is very polite, and they will take the initiative to explain the cultural history on the road.
3. Especially on the last day, I wanted to check in Erhai Moon Park before going to the airport. The driver, Mr. Qiang, gave better advice and took us to a place with few people and invincible scenery to take pictures. The trip to Dali was a perfect ending.

Not so pleasant place:
1. The trash can in the bathroom of the first room was not cleaned, which affected the first impression
2. The handover and communication at the front desk of the hotel are not smooth. My understanding is that there should be a system to remark the communication situation of customers in time.
3. The air conditioner in my friend's room is actually broken, and the temperature in the room has been very high. After the repair was reported, the child fell asleep at 11 o'clock in the middle of the night and asked to change the room... How can such a problem occur in a new hotel?

Overall, I still give it a five-star praise. I hope the new hotel will be better. Dali is beautiful, and I will come again!

At the beginning of the opening, the price in the early 1,000 yuan not only included the stunning lake view room and breakfast, but also was given a high-value afternoon tea. After staying for one night, I decided to continue my stay.
From the view to the service, the hotel must be full of praise! The best hotel in Dali, no one!

msg:This is the first time I stayed in a Pullman hotel. This newly opened hotel in Dali has good facilities and equipment. The location is good. The staff are very enthusiastic and enthusiastic. However, this time I encountered many problems.
Questions: 1. The check-in time is long. I arrived at the hotel at 5 o'clock in the afternoon. It seems that there are many people who continue to stay. The hotel did not arrange rooms in advance. Fortunately, the front desk has been chatting with me.
2. There are stains on the countertop of the minibar in the room, and the manager on duty told me that there is no way to deal with it.
3. The welcome fruit has not been delivered. When I returned to the hotel in the evening, I found that it was not delivered. I told the guest service center that I had asked for a few bottles of water and then went out. When I came back, the fruit was given, and the water was directly thrown on the shoe stool.
4. The toilet socket is out of power, and the smart toilet is out of power. I reacted the next day and the project is repaired.
5. After cleaning the room, a sign for changing sheets and quilts was placed on the bed, but the sheets and quilts were not replaced, and the bedside pillows were directly placed on the shoe stool. After cleaning, the room card that was placed in the room's power outlet was taken away. There was long hair in the towel, still yellowish. It was too late to change the sheets and towels. Taking away the room card is a security issue. Hair in the towel is the bottom line of hygiene. Maybe you didn't pay attention to cleaning the room. The compensation given by the hotel was afternoon tea in the executive lounge the next afternoon and a late withdrawal, which was declined.
Lots of advantages:
1. The duty manager Eleven helped to deal with a lot of problems during the stay, which was very troublesome to her. I gave her a five-star praise and liked it.
2. The concierge is particularly praised, and the initiative is very strong.
3. During the stay, I met a staff member in the elevator who was extremely polite and professional. After reading the famous brand called Gray, my favorability for the hotel doubled.
4. The hardware is in place, the mini bar is abundant, electric curtains, smart toilets, and TV can be projected (full score).
The price of the starry sky bar on the 5.25th floor is quite low, and the environment is good and worth a drink.
6. The breakfast dishes are less, but the service is better.
7. Staff have a high degree of recognition of the hotel.
There are a lot of small problems in the guest room. If you are more careful, there will be nothing. The merit is greater than the demerit. I still highly recommend everyone to experience the stay. I have a physique that is prone to various problems when I live in a hotel, so those problems are not bad for me, ha Haha, I hope it will be better next time I go to live there.

msg:During the Chinese New Year, after constant comparison, between Dali Strength Hilton and Junfa Pullman, I finally chose to spend the New Year holiday at Dali Junfa Pullman, which is generally good. The hotel is a newly opened international chain hotel. I stayed for 3 days. I feel that the hardware is good as a whole, but there are still many problems in service management. First: There is a big difference between the enthusiasm of the front desk service at the time of check-in and the contact in the later period. There is no sincerity of the Pullman service (which may have a great relationship with the level of the entrusted management company). It feels like the reception on the first day. It is the presentation of superficial work; second: When dealing with some small problems, I don’t know how to serve, such as reminding guests to pay attention to the problems when entering the swimming pool, can I be more warm, and always stay by the swimming pool and stare at the guests, knowing that you are doing your best to be safe Ambulance preparations, those who don’t know think you’re monitoring (the second time I went to the gym, the waitress on duty was very nice, and got one point for the bad impression of a previous male waiter); third: New Year’s Eve On the first day of the new year, there is a lion dance to open the door to wealth, and the top management of the hotel seems to be present. Can you make it easier? After all, no matter how big the senior management is when you turn on the TV, you will also greet the guests, and smiling to the guests during the Chinese New Year will show you more self-restraint; Fourth: During breakfast for 3 days in a row, I heard the waiter quietly discussing the guests, such as: a certain guest likes to complain, whether a certain guest is registered... It feels really bad; fifth: The room attendants are basically locals, they are really simple and the service is very sincere, which is a good feeling. Sixth: After connecting with the service consultant, the submitted service needs can basically be met, but the speed is very, very slow. Is it the service? There is a problem with staffing or division of labor, which is seriously inconsistent with Pullman's service level. There are more than one knocks on the wrong door in the middle of the night, and once the door is opened, speechless.
The above is just an objective evaluation. The hardware management of the hotel is still good, but it may be necessary to work hard on the service level. I hope that the next stay can make greater progress.

This Pullman, which opened in 21 years, is temporarily the best hotel in Dali in terms of service, room decoration and supplies. The welcome ambassador Bella was very considerate and helped us to upgrade to a sea view room; the coco and beata people in the executive lounge were very nice, and the afternoon tea that ended at 5:00 helped us to wait until 5:30. If you want to lie flat in Dali, Pullman is a good choice.
The lack of dimension 1 is the breakfast. There are a few kinds of food, and the taste is average. It took a long time to eat the bait cubes and eggs Benedict. Maybe the new opening and the large number of people during holidays, the service can not keep up.

Facts have proved that my judgment is correct! Really nice hotel!
The environment and service are really amazing! The traffic is also very convenient, it takes 30 minutes to the ancient city and only 10 minutes to the airport!
On the floor where I stayed, the customer service lady Li Huiling helped me reserve the 16th floor, the highest floor of the lake view room! The scenery is so beautiful!
Because the price of the reservation is a lot more expensive than the price at the time of check-in, it is said that the afternoon tea in the executive lounge on the 21st floor is presented, and the breakfast is also super rich!

In terms of improvement, it may be that the mirrored bedside table in the room is a little dusty, and the pillow should be replaced with a latex pillow early in the morning, because the pillow is too short to sleep well at night. I blame myself for not telling the customer service lady in advance to ask for a change!

but! If I go to Dali again, I will choose Pullman! Really recommend and really like it!

We were a group of 3 adults and 2 children. Please ask the hotel front desk to call a car for us. 6 people or 2 taxis went to Haidilao for dinner. What I didn't expect was that they refused, saying that they couldn't call a car, and they didn't even want to help us go outside and directly stop the taxi and let us call it ourselves. The second time the next morning, we asked the front desk of the hotel to book a car for us to go to Dali Station again, but the other party still refused, saying that it was the peak season and they couldn't call a car, so they didn't even want to try it! Having stayed in so many hotels, this is the first time I have encountered such a wonderful thing, and it is ridiculous and speechless!

Eleven at the front desk of the lake view room that I booked has been upgraded to an executive lake view, and they also provided breakfast for children. I was flattered by the butler service. Thank you Felix for helping with the luggage, very kind. The upper floors can directly see the Erhai Lake. The toiletries in the room are all from L'Occitane, the shower faucets are all from GROHE, the thermostatic faucet is very comfortable, and the toilet is toto's washlet. What moved me the most was the small gifts and surprises that Eleven sent me before I left. They were so attentive. Small surprises will not be posted, let's experience it for yourself! The lounge on the 25th floor is amazing, the wine is good, and the view is beautiful. Had a great time here for 3 days! Pullman is the best!

Special thanks to coco at the front desk for recommending the hotel for its warm service, and Simon Xiaowu, who provides free and warm pick-up and drop-off service. Also gave me a room upgrade.

The response speed of the inspection and monitoring is also slow, and it is processed from the night before to noon the next day. In addition, many of the sockets in the room can not be used.
The hotel has a good view and good sanitary conditions.
I just don't think five star hotels should treat suite guests like this.

In addition, Bella sent me a document of Dali tourist attractions and Internet celebrity restaurants, which recorded the specific conditions of each scenic spot and restaurant in detail, and felt the hotel's intentions. Looking forward to the hotel. After checking in, I was really not disappointed. The service of the whole team in the hotel is very enthusiastic, just like coming home. The room can see the beautiful Erhai Lake, sitting on the bay window and enjoying a good time. The hotel's lounge is on the 21st floor, with a super-beautiful first-line sea view, as well as warm smiles and family-like service staff. great! Special thanks to the hotel's Welcome Ambassador Manager Bella, Concierge Joe, Kiros and Molly at the front desk, the whole check-in process was very pleasant, and it was a pleasure to meet everyone here.

msg:Perfect perfect perfect! I am really happy to be here on the first day of the new year and New Year's Eve. This hotel is one of the biggest surprises during this trip. I stayed in a B&B for two or three days. Although the price is more expensive than here, the experience is not as good as here. This Pullman is not as good as it is in terms of hardware, service, and overall customer satisfaction. My care is the most comfortable and best hotel I have ever stayed in under the Accor Group. In the early morning of the first day of the new year, I opened the curtains and looked at the Erhai Lake, all troubles disappeared. . . Have been to Dali countless times, this time because Pullman is the most perfect! A small gift was given at the time of parting. The breakfast restaurant knew that we like their desserts and specially packed a portion for us. Although it was a small surprise, it was indeed a great sense of happiness. Come to Dali B&B, but this one Pullman is definitely not to be missed. . .

msg:When I travelled to Dali, I saw many homestays on Ctrip, and I chose branded hotels. Thanks to the ambassador manager Bella and the lounge supervisor coco for their warm reception. The service was so good that I was very satisfied with my hotel staying experience, even not very embarrassed. I traveled by car and drove a full circle along the Erhai Lake in Dali. I saw the Pullman Hotel and checked on Ctrip. It was a newly opened hotel. I called the front desk and only opened for a few days. I originally thought that the smell of the hotel and the room would be very heavy, and there was no smell when entering the room and the hotel, and the hardware and software were very new.

❤️Location: The location of the hotel is right by the Erhai Sea and in the city. It is very convenient for both viewing the scenery and eating. It is also only a 10-minute drive from Dali Shopping Mall and a 20-minute drive to the ancient city of Dali.

❤Room ️Environment: The decoration of the hotel is very stylish. It is a warm color that I like. There is a spiral staircase when entering the lobby. It is very beautiful and suitable for taking pictures. The room is also very beautiful, you can see the Erhai Lake through the window when you enter the room, it is really beautiful. The toilet in the room is also electrically heated. My favorite is that there are two sinks, which is very convenient.

❤️Gym: The equipment of the gym is imported, and the equipment is very complete. You can also see the scenery of Erhai Lake when you run on the treadmill. There is a swimming pool next to the gym, as well as a special pool for children, with everything you need for swimming laps.

❤️There is also a lounge on the 25th floor of the hotel. Sitting in the lounge on New Year’s Eve and watching the fireworks outside is really beautiful. The service of the young lady in the lounge is also very good. The cocktails in the lounge are not bad. The cocktails in the package are No. 2 It’s delicious, 168 people, free-flowing cocktails and Fenghuaxueyue beer, as well as snack platter and cheesecake. This New Year's Eve is perfect and romantic.

❤️The hotel’s breakfast is also quite rich, and the environment is particularly good. Two bowls of fried noodles are directly dried. I personally feel that brand hotels are much better than homestays in terms of services, hardware facilities, and meals.

❤️Finally emphasize [service]. In fact, there are many choices of hotels, but not every hotel's service makes you satisfied and comfortable. The service at Pullman Dali is really unforgettable for me. I booked a deluxe room. The lady was so happy to upgrade us to a sea-view room. She helped bring our luggage to the room, and took us to the top floor lounge for a visit and introduction, one-on-one. The service is really good, thank you Bella and coco for their service, I will stay again next time I go to Dali.

He thinks what the guests think, and the advanced service is commendable. He helped me upgrade the lake view room for free and gave me a late check-out. All hotel staff are very kind and patient. For work reasons, I have stayed in many hotels at home and abroad. It is not difficult to achieve luxurious decoration of a hotel, but the patient and friendly attitude of the service staff is difficult. This shows that Pullman's management is in place! Next time I come to Dali, I will definitely choose Pullman!

酒店內設：雅高的酒店，法國人的風格，裝修風格比較現代，尤其是鉑爾曼，索菲特標誌性的半月浴缸，因為新開緣故設施都比較新。
酒店服務：沒的説，前台管家molly小姐很熱情周到，不僅發了一份整理好的大理旅遊攻略，還每天恰到好處得問候第二天需要幫忙的地方，要不要延遲退房什麼的。酒店打掃服務也很到位，我個人比較亂東西喜歡亂丟，保潔人員都幫我放的整整齊齊。
總得來説是一次比較愉快的體驗，唯一稍顯不足可能是早餐也許可以更豐富一些。

入住前就有管家Tracy提前溝通需求，她非常專業且熱情 讓我還沒入住就對鉑爾曼非常期待，入住後果然如我預料一樣，不僅地理位置好（附近本地吃的多），房間景觀也非常好（肉眼看比我拍得照片強十倍吧，）
其他的話，賓客服務，房間打掃甚至是游泳池也沒有任何雷點，細節處理非常到位 也從來沒有遇到過冷漠的服務人員，都很熱情
非常棒 下次來大理還會選擇鉑爾曼的！

要特別誇一下服務，是本次雲南之行住過酒店最佳，軟性服務非常好，甚至能彌補一些硬件的不足了。從抵達門口迎賓，到前台、餐廳的服務人員，都非常nice。管家Beata簡直太棒了，貼心的發來詳細大理攻略，呆了幾天按照她提供的攻略吃吃玩玩就很ok，非常有幫助，果然人美心細。
酒店頂樓bar風景一流，推薦日落黃昏時候去喝一杯。
唯一覺得需要改善的地方大概也就是早餐，因為大理長期是旅遊熱門地，住客基本都是滿的，早餐需要等位；以及住幾天發現每天種類幾乎沒變化，每天吃一樣的還是有點無聊的。

還有漂亮的泳池和浴缸。
唯獨就是晚上去酒吧的時候三個服務生都沒有穿工服感覺很隨意的樣子，點了兩杯酒送去房間想泡澡喝，就竟然是用咖啡紙杯裝的！

入住前一天管家Herro就聯繫我，溝通入住需求，晚上八點多入住知道給升房了，但是天黑沒太看窗外。早上拉開窗簾，非常驚喜，洱海就在眼前，頓時心情大好，尤其在版納經歷了堵車人多到懷疑人生之後。
小朋友還體驗了泳池，泡了澡，早餐也很棒。
因為是晚上五點的火車，Herro給安排了延遲2點退房和行政酒廊下午茶。
總之，非常開心的兩天，謝謝管家Herro的安排。

設施：酒店比較新，設施各方面都很到位
服務：提前會有歡迎大使聯繫，謝謝Beata還有前台幫忙協調房間的Nancy
地理位置：離高鐵站很近加分，旺季也不用擔心堵車

另外房間每天補充8瓶水實在是太貼心了！大理真的太乾燥了，多喝水很有必要哈哈

首先，特別感謝下我的管家Mary，她的專業和關懷讓整個行程變得無比愉快。
Mary為我們升級到了行政套房，真的特別驚喜！套房的空間寬敞舒適，內部裝飾典雅，讓我感覺賓至如歸。而更讓我感動的是，Mary還特別為我們準備了紀念日禮遇，並送來了一個精美可口的蛋糕。這個意外的驚喜讓情人節更加難忘！
早餐是我在酒店住宿期間最期待的時刻之一，而這家酒店的早餐絕對沒有讓我失望。品類豐富，每一樣食物都經過精心準備，尤其是鮮榨果汁，西柚汁和菠蘿汁特別棒，每一口都讓人感受到新鮮和美味。
酒店頂層的星空bar也很棒，調酒很有層次感，單點的土豆芝士球很美味，氛圍也很好！
在入住之前，我通過電話提前詢問了枕頭的選擇，而酒店的反應讓我感到驚喜。他們不僅及時地回答了我的問題，還貼心地為我準備了記憶枕，酒店的床也很舒服，讓我享受到了舒適安心的睡眠體驗。
行政房附帶的下午茶特別棒，金槍魚塔塔和章魚都很好吃，柚子慕斯特別清新很有層次感！
總的來説，這次入住經歷讓我對這家酒店留下了非常深刻的印象。從優質的服務到舒適的住宿環境，每一個細節都體現出了酒店的用心和專業。再次感謝Mary和整個酒店團隊，我期待着下次再次光臨！

辦理入住時，Kiros很熱情地接待了我們，諮詢他附近遊玩的地方，也非常熱心地給我建議與指南。第二天退房的時候看到我也能馬上叫出我的名字，並幫我行李寄存，全程專業又温暖。
酒店的工作人員這麼暖心的舉動，彌補了房間上的一些不足。mini吧一般，淋浴房裡麪的沐浴露也完全沒有了，後來找到房間備有的一瓶小童沐浴露，湊合用了一下。

msg:這些年住過很多酒店和民宿，我很少積極主動的去點評。但這次入住大理俊發鉑爾曼酒店，體驗非常好，所以專門來點評。體驗好的核心是服務很温暖、及時。我們的入住管家是Coco，提前一天對接了入住細節並升級了房間；入住後長者突然頭暈較嚴重，Coco立刻告知大理最好的醫院，並提供快速送診，因我們是自駕，所以選擇了自己開車到醫院。醫生確認是長者有點高原反應，不嚴重，須吃香蕉快速補充鉀，Coco又安排了送香蕉到房間（還贈送了小朋友早餐券）。另外，酒店的泳池是恆温的，並可以俯瞰洱海，很漂亮。酒店的餐廳品質很好，如果買套餐也不貴。如果你和我一樣比較看重品質和性價比，建議大理俊發鉑爾曼酒店可以作為首選考慮。

一進酒店大門，就被那寬敞明亮的大堂所吸引。大理的陽光透過落地窗灑在每一個角落，給人一種温暖而舒適的感覺。我要特別提到一個名叫Coco的員工，入住前她就熱情周到的聯繫，提供精美攻略，入住時還幫免費升級了湖景房，讓我有種賓至如歸的感覺。早餐是這次入住的一大亮點，品種豐富，能滿足各種口味。而最讓我滿意的還是孩子們的體驗，客房入住時在湖景窗台開心得不行，在泳池也玩得樂不思蜀。孩子們在這裏玩得開心，大人們也得以安心享受自己的時光。
總的來説，大理鉑爾曼酒店的服務、設施以及員工都給我留下了深刻的印象。如果計劃來大理旅遊，我真心推薦你選擇這家酒店。相信你也會和我一樣，留下一段美好的回憶！

msg:如果可以給200分！那鉑爾曼就是200分！真的太棒了
2019年來的時候，住了個古城邊靠海的民宿，但真的不行！很不行！所以這次我告訴自己，必須定酒店！
選來選去選了鉑爾曼，新酒店就是好，各種都新嶄嶄的！然後從預訂開始就給我很好的印象

服務：臨近入住了，管家Mary主動加微信，咣噹給了我一大堆攻略，然後給我升了海景房，入住期間回覆速度極快，特別貼心。聖誕節還送了我一個平安果放在床上，哇，很驚喜的，然後每天不是蒸汽眼罩就是補水面膜，這不比民宿貼心嗎？

衞生：很乾凈！我有潔癖的，沒得挑剔

環境：旁邊是很有名的那座橋，海景房是面朝洱海，因為層高比民宿高，看得特別遠！

設施：酒店新就是好啊，哪兒哪兒都很新，沒啥使用痕跡

我住過很多五星級啦（萬豪鉑金），這家鉑爾曼依然可以排Top！
認真的，民宿的景去看看幾小時就夠了，不用住在民宿裏，酒店才是正道！
再次感謝Mary和其他酒店服務人員對我的關照！！鞠躬
下次還來，不見不散！

3. 服務前台Edison很貼心，日常詢問回覆都很及時。處理問題速度也非常及時。
4. 房間景色很好，完全物超所值！
建議：
1. 客房的窗户和門的隔音效果相對一般，但是晚上睡覺很安靜。
2. 房卡套有點太緊，電梯和房門都不算靈敏，需要把房卡拿出來掃（估計也是為了安全！）。但是因為卡套太緊，拿房卡稍微有點不太方便。

環境：高樓層窗外視野開闊。酒店地處位置的交通，在17:20至19:00算是bug（恰巧在限行區內），好在這個時間段裏，正是在外遊玩吃飯的鐘點兒，倒也不影響駕車回酒店的問題。早上7:30開始，酒店門口是潮汐車道，去機場很順暢。

服務：管家Beata很贊，無微不至地服務倍感親切，不僅升級房間，還附贈了行政酒廊的下午茶（甜品優質）。大堂禮賓部的小夥子，服務意識很強。

由於是在後疫情裝修的，裝備的中央空調加新風系統，單個房間內置的空調無法調節温度，晚上熱的睡不着。酒店雖然提供了風扇，但是沒有什麼用。好在之後開了一天的窗户，温度才有所回落。

正文:
家人們，今天我要給大家安利一個酒店，就是大理俊發鉑爾曼酒店！真的，這家酒店的服務人員doris姐姐真的太驚艷了！

先來簡單介紹一下這家酒店吧，位置就在大理古城附近，周邊環境真的超棒，去蒼山洱海都很方便！酒店的外觀也是超級無敵ins風，拍出來的照片每一幀都是滿滿的ins風大片！

説到Doris姐姐，真的是服務界的一股清流！她不僅人美心善，而且真的是全能選手，不管你有什麼需求，她都能給你安排得明明白白的！真的是救命，我住過那麼多酒店，就屬這家的服務最讓我滿意！

酒店的房間也是超級舒服，床墊是牌子的，躺上去真的超級舒服！房間裏的設施也都是最新的，真的是細節拉滿！

答應我，一定要試試這家酒店，真的不會讓你失望的！如果你問我有什麼缺點，那可能就是你會覺得其他酒店都不如這家了！😉

酒店位置很方便，市中心的位置如果旅遊的話環洱海東線西線都是很不錯的起點。
入住前一天歡迎大使COCO就提前聯繫並且熱情告知了入住的一系列事項，在酒店的全程也隨時保持專業和及時的服務，很細緻很周到。酒店前台的服務態度也很好，會主動幫拿行李和開車門。
早餐和酒廊，游泳池健身房這些設施這次沒來得及體驗，暫不評價，下次有機會會全面體驗。
總之是不錯的入住體驗。

msg:入住@大理俊發鉑爾曼酒店 是我們大理之行的亮點。管家Coco的專業素養和用心接待給我們深刻印象。酒店設施新，人員素質高，地理位置優越。酒店與洱海幾步之遙，房間和各個公用設施場地都能看到洱海的美景。酒店距離高鐵站也很近，10分鐘左右的車程。管家Coco從入住前到我們離店之後都提供了温暖和專業的服務，這樣的服務會讓客人入住一次還想再來。唯一一點小建議：3樓中餐的温度在這段時間需要調整一下，很多客人都反應太冷了。空調和陽台大門都是關着的，卻還有無法解釋的涼風習習。我們在那裡就餐數次，包括午餐和晚餐，除了我們自己也目睹了很多其他客人反應餐廳的温度過低，有些客人不得不離開。雖然餐廳有提供小毯子，但是披着毯子在五星酒店用餐，總是有些滑稽和奇怪。希望餐廳管理團隊未來能提高温控的能力。總而言之，謝謝酒店的管理團隊和各位工作人員給我們的大理之行留下美好的回憶。

msg:設施：非常全，有餐廳，健身房和游泳池，尤其是小童泳池的温度適宜，在秋天裡也很温暖，不怕孩子着涼，非常貼心。早餐很豐盛，咖啡機的咖啡不錯，推薦卡布奇諾。

衞生：衞生不錯，每天的清潔都很及時，有一天在房間沒出去，打掃的阿姨先吸塵後拖地，地毯和地板都弄的到，感覺非常放心。
環境:對面就是大理港遊船碼頭，環洱海觀光巴士在這裏也有一站，非常方便。景觀就更不用説了，大飄窗非常出片，讓心情放鬆下來。
服務:最滿意的就是服務了，定房之後就有nancy小管家聯繫我，幫我升級了房間，並且詢問枕頭偏好和小童情況，入住時就準備好了小童用品，很滿意很貼心。還發送了大理遊玩指南，攻略很細緻，非常值得參考。因為沒有連續訂房，所以在可能需要調換房間時nancy也熱心幫忙溝通，最後不需要換房入住，方便了帶娃旅遊的我。餐廳服務也很不錯，咖啡不需要自己去打，有工作人員幫忙。門口的接待也主動幫忙提行李，寄存也很方便，一百個滿意。
一個小建議:因為住前一個酒店的時候，主動提供了小童用的乳膠枕，我以為這邊也會備有小童枕頭，結果詢問了之後沒有，衹能用大人的乳膠枕，所以在此建議也準備一些小童床品，提供更舒適的旅行體驗。

客房保潔的還可以，但畢竟是新酒店，硬件維護還是要加強，淋浴的五金件有鬆動，馬桶的固定也存在一些問題，坐上去會有鬆動的聲音，工程部要加強維護啦。下次有機會再來體驗～

一點小建議是馬路邊酒店標識可以在明顯一點，方便進店及找停車場

msg:坦白講本來是想在梅里看日照金山的時候求婚的 但是22號早晨別提日照金山了 連山都沒看到 全是霧… 戒指都揣褲兜了愣是沒有求
	
訂的鉑爾曼酒店本來是想求完婚可以淺度幾天蜜月 但是臨時情況有變 就不得不臨時打電話給鉑爾曼告知他們這個情況 看能不能簡單幫忙佈置一下 酒店立馬心領神會 到了酒店後管家小王Herro立馬着手安排一切佈置 本來跟我講的是衹能簡單撒點花瓣和氣球 但是實際如圖 非常用心並且還幫忙打印了我們的照片擺放在各個角落 還送了小蛋糕給我們 過程中Herro與我的對話也很專業 用了很多隱晦的詞為了求婚計劃不露餡 很多細節的處理也很細心 我個人也很感謝能有這樣一次住房體驗 真的是住過的酒店裡服務最好的 沒有之一
	
強烈推薦去大理的朋友入住鉑爾曼 當時考慮了在大理住民宿 但是大理有名的好的民宿不吹不黑實在是太不值那個價…打着以某某明星入住過以及各種網紅美景的旗號收着1000-4000（甚至更多）一晚的價格個人認為有點貴了 不如多花點錢入住一個好的酒店來的實在
	
最後再次感謝Herro以及鉑爾曼酒店

酒店旁邊就是洱海公園，傍晚在洱海美景中散步太愜意了。酒店對面是大理港，可以坐遊船環遊洱海，值得一試。附近不遠處就是網紅橋興盛大橋，非常出片😄。
酒店的硬件設施有改善的空間，但鉑爾曼的服務態度真的很不錯，還幫我們安排了免費送機。
早餐很豐富，5樓餐廳味道不錯，2樓自助晚餐也很棒！
如果再來大理，仍然會考慮入住鉑爾曼。

入住期間mini吧暢飲: 最後誇一下酒店真的很捨得給飲用水，每天都有補，沖就對了。
