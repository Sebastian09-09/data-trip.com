Afternoon tea is nothing but oranges, biscuits, tea and coffee machine, and western breakfast is far from a 5 diamonds hotel standard. Understandable as we were the only western guests.

Last thing is you won‚Äôt be able to profit the room during the day as the hotel is close the a busy road full of vehicles,

We thoroughly enjoyed it and wish we could stay longer - will definitely stay here again if we visit Yangshuo next time. Location is on the Yulong river side, with tranquil scenery, proximity to the bamboo rafting wharf, and plenty of cute little places to eat local food, take photos and mingle with the locals. Special thanks to the staff who were very friendly and helpful, their complimentary pickup to the hotel and ride to the Xijie was super helpful, especially because we came  during the time of ***** New Year rush and transportation was a challenge. The little goodbye gift bag with some local specialties was very pleasant. We loved everythingüòç

They brought drinks to the pool for me and helped me buy tickets for all the fun activities that I did. A special thanks to the employees that drove me around in luxury cars. 
I was solo-traveling and didn‚Äôt know my way around. They helped me book a driver from the Airport to the Resort then also took me wherever I wanted on time with no delays. 

The food is predominantly Chinese cuisines but that didn‚Äôt bother me much. I did try the beer fish and it was delicious.  

Thank you so much for the wonderful stay, It didn‚Äôt feel like I was alone.

The winding and slender Shili Gallery turns a corner and bypasses a century-old tree, and the hotel appears brightly in front of you. With its white exterior design and well-organized structure, you can see the store‚Äôs intentions at a glance. It was so beautiful to sit on the terrace at night and listen to the sound of frogs near Jima Pier opposite. The room is large and clean, and the building materials are practical. What surprised me most was the hotel service, which was very warm and generous, full of care and trust for guests, and full of comfort. Highly recommended.

msg:The view from the room is acceptable, but the service level of the hotel is extremely amateurish and there is a serious shortage of manpower. I can only describe the level of cooperation between various depar**ents as a grass-roots team. The sanitation and supporting facilities can only be regarded as high-end B&Bs, far from meeting the standards of a "luxury hotel".
    When we arrived at the hotel on the first day, there was a long flight of steps with a rest platform between the hotel entrance and the lobby on the second floor. It was such an inconvenient stretch but there were no staff on the first floor to help pick up the luggage, so my family and I had to carry it ourselves. Two heavy suitcases went up the steps. After checking in, the front desk of the "luxury hotel" was sitting down to serve us, while the passengers stood and waited. After checking in, a little guy helped us push our luggage to the room.
    When I opened the toilet, the water was turbid, as if it had not been cleaned. After asking the front desk, I learned that the groundwater pumped out was not clean due to the heavy rain the day before. I tried the water on the sink and bathroom and it was the same, so I had to make do with it until noon the next day. Improved. It's unbelievable that the hotel has no water filtering device at such a price.
    Dinner at the hotel started at 5 o'clock. We were seated at 5:10 and ordered our dishes. We were repeatedly urged to wait until nearly 5:50 before the first course was served. After asking, we learned that there was only one chef working, but we were the only ones having dinner at that time. The cafe next door said it closed at 6 o'clock sharp. We ordered extra drinks around 5:40, but after half an hour they didn't arrive, so we asked the waiter to go to the cafe next door to remind us. I don‚Äôt know if the coffee shop is designed like a maze, but it obviously only requires a walkie-talkie or WeChat confirmation. It took me ten minutes to come out and tell me that the barista was off work. Needless to say, there are many bad reviews on the breakfast category. It is worth mentioning that the hotel took the initiative to arrange a car delivery after learning that we were going to the 7:30 show, and the guy‚Äôs driving skills were praised. By the way, this guy also plays the role of serving food, urging food, and being a driver.
    The hotel is close to farmland and there are many mosquitoes. Every morning, mosquito and fly corpses are everywhere at the door of the room and in the elevator. In the afternoon, the aisle in front of the elevator was stacked with carts and sheets used by the aunt for cleaning, without any regard for the feelings of the guests who checked in at this point.
    The most important thing is that there is an extremely unreasonable landscape tree designed on the way to the entrance of our building. Visitors can only cross the steps or carefully lower their heads to pass under the tree. It is very inconvenient whether they are pushing luggage or not. On the last day to check out, due to the heavy luggage and the extremely steep and narrow luggage compar**ent on the side of the stairs, I lost my footing when I came down and hit my temple on a cut treetop. If it was at the brow bone, there would be blood, and the swelling at the temple has not subsided to this day. The reason why this treetop was cut off must have caused a lot of inconvenience before, so why not just remove this green belt? It is really a unnecessary and inconvenient design that disrupts the flow of movement, and the angle of the luggage ramp does not comply with fire safety regulations.
    The construction quality of the glass railing outside the laundry room on the second floor is very poor. Many places are tilted inward or outward. If a guest accidentally leans on it, the consequences will be disastrous. There is no sign to remind them not to rely on it.
    Generally speaking, it is really difficult for the hotel to meet the service level of a "luxury hotel" given by Ctrip. The room prices are inflated, so please choose carefully.

   If you come to Yangshuo, remember to check in at this hotel! It is said that it was renovated once in 22 years, so the hotel environment is very new now. The outside looks like a whole transparent glass white house, which is very fresh! The cafe here has indoor and outdoor seating. It is a good place to drink coffee. It is super comfortable to enjoy the beautiful scenery and enjoy the coffee! Photographers are also provided here to take photos for free, which is really cool!

The hotel housekeepers Xiaoxiang and Xiaotao also communicated very smoothly. There is free pick-up and drop-off to West Street, which is very convenient. By the way, I would like to make two comments. One is that the complimentary afternoon tea is too simple. It is better to give away two drink coupons for the coffee shop. The hair dryer in the other room seems to have been reduced and it is not a Dyson, which lowers the quality a bit. üòÖ

msg:I travel a lot and have stayed in many hotels/B&Bs. Most of them are booked on Ctrip but I almost never write reviews. But this time I took the initiative to write a review.
We are a family of six, four adults and two children traveling by car during the Spring Festival. We first visited Beihai and Weizhou Island. On the seventh day of the ***** New Year, we arrived in Yangshuo, the most beautiful landscape we have longed for. We have always been looking forward to the most beautiful scenery in the world. On that day, I had a cold and a fever. I felt very uncomfortable. When I got to the room, I lay down on my back. I booked the Paddy Field Hotel after repeated comparisons and research online. I thought it would be good, but I didn‚Äôt expect it to be so good!
The hotel housekeeper Xiao Tao immediately gave me cold medicine after learning that I had a cold, which made me feel warm in a different place during the Spring Festival. Lying on the bed, I turned my head and happened to see the sunset. I instantly felt healed by nature. The hotel has established a VIP service group to meet my service needs at any time. Because the hotel environment and facilities are very good, the two children had a lot of fun in the hotel, and because I was not feeling well, we spent almost all of the three days and two nights in and outside the hotel, and did not go sightseeing elsewhere.
I am a yoga teacher and singing bowl healer, and I have my own ideas about travel photography. The hotel's free travel photography is very good. It is better than the environment and framing, and I am satisfied with the photos I took. We have stayed in many hotels and B&Bs at home and abroad. This is the first time my husband has praised a hotel we have stayed in. It is worth the money. Apart from other things, the hair dryer in the room is a Dyson and the TV is equipped with a Boss speaker. These small hardware facilities are great. . The housekeeper Xiaotao has a high emotional intelligence and a strong sense of service. He is very dedicated. Hearing that my daughter likes to eat rice noodles, he took the initiative to give me an extra rice noodle. Thank you very much. Xiaohui also left a very deep impression on me. The little brother was very enthusiastic and thoughtful.
My overall impression of Paddy Field is that it is a very professional and high-quality hotel. I think the owner must be a senior hotelier and a person with feelings to design such a comfortable hotel and make such a professional, rigorous and humane plan. management and service standards, cultivating such a professional and warm team.
I recommend friends who go to Yangshuo to go to the rice fields. There are very few places I would go all the way to, and this is one place and hotel I would go to again. Thank you to the rice field team!

Yangshuo is really beautiful.
Even in slightly cold January, it has its own unique beauty.
This time I chose to stay at the Rice Field Resort Hotel, and I fell in love with the scenery in front of me the moment I checked in.
A whole side of floor-to-ceiling windows offers a panoramic view of the surrounding picturesque scenery.
Lying in bed is extremely comfortable.
The infinity pool downstairs also has many photo props: straw hats, glass boats, and floating beds.
There is also a sky mirror on the roof with reflections on the water and beautiful views of the mountains, making it look like a blockbuster whenever you take a photo.
There are smart facilities throughout the room and considerate butler service. The whole stay was so comfortable!
I really want to stay at this resort hotel for a second time!

This is really the only hotel I don't want to leave after staying here.

Lived in the great rivers and mountains of the motherland. A big river has wide waves and the wind blows the fragrance of rice flowers on both sides. This song is so harmonious here.

This time I was extravagant and booked a room with 270-degree floor-to-ceiling windows. Through the hotel's floor-to-ceiling panoramic glass, I can see the rice fields and mountain peaks, and the picture of a fairyland on earth emerges before my eyes. This feeling is so wonderful!

The hotel has a luxurious and minimalist room design without main lights, which is amazing. There is also an infinity swimming pool in the hotel and a Sky Realm check-in point on the roof, which is so thoughtfully designed.

Who has lived in a place like this and still wants to leave?

It's right near the Jima Village Railway Station. The location is easy to find. It's a must-see for scenic spots. I used to pass by it when riding an electric bike back and forth.
The room is particularly nice. It feels like a super flat floor. It is very large and clean. The view is unparalleled, with a panoramic view of the rice fields. The design of the room is very reasonable, with dry and wet separation, toilet and shower room separated. If you live as a family, the bathtub is separate from the toilet, so no one will be affected by the other. Even if you are a family of four, it is very easy to live. The two beds are separate and seem to be connected, so there is no fear of the child falling out of the bed.
The tea table is of good quality, and it is so pleasant to make tea while looking at the rice fields outside.
The swimming pool is also beautiful, and there is an acrylic boat. The bar in the lobby serves Xiangyin green grapes, cherry tomatoes, coffee‚òïÔ∏è scented tea, and there is also a baby play room. There is also a Turkish-style photo spot and a sky mirror on the roof.
There are many kinds of breakfast. Then there is free pick-up and drop-off üöó and free travel photography. I really can‚Äôt praise this hotel enough. The waiters are very flexible and helpful. Next time I come to Yangshuo, I will definitely stay here again. It‚Äôs really worth it. All in all, the room was really comfortable! !

The room was great and outside the window The scenery is also very beautiful, 270 degrees view, there is a rice field downstairs, children like it very much, and babies also like to play in the children's playground downstairs. Xiao Tao also helped bring wooden horses and small chairs to the room, and established a butler group , he sent me the hotel facilities and nearby places to visit. It was great. We rented a tricycle at the hotel for convenience. Xiao Tao reminded me carefully of the precautions. I had Guilin rice noodles for breakfast, which tasted good. I didn‚Äôt eat the food, and the hotel also sent a travel photo, but the kids refused to take photos, so it was useless. When it was time to check out, the children refused to leave. Xiao Tao helped carry the luggage to the car and gave them gifts. Looking forward to seeing you next time

Bath salts and roses are specially prepared for bathing, as well as disposable bath protective covers. Hygiene is particularly considered. The location of the hotel is particularly good. You can see beautiful rapeseed flowers and the scenery of the Yulong River from the terrace. The close-up views of the original mountains are reflected on the balcony. It feels great. Two small suggestions: 1. The aunt who cleaned up suggested to be more careful. It would be better to take away the dessert bowls delivered the night before when cleaning the room the next day. 2. I reported it to the guy at the front desk and suggested adding an anti-scalding ring to the tea bowl. Thumbs up to the guy at the front desk and the restaurant staff for taking the initiative to deliver the suitcases to the room. When dining in the restaurant, they thoughtfully asked about my needs and the taste of the food. The service was excellent. The dish we ordered in the restaurant was the most delicious and comfortable meal we had in Yangshuo. Thank you.

msg:Fortunately, I chose the rice field this time. It was very cost-effective and allowed the three of us to get enough rest for five days and four nights. The view from the balcony was also great ~ it was a large green rice field! There is a small train station in front of the hotel, and further down the road is the Yulong River, which is very suitable for a morning walk.
The facilities in the room are complete, the hot water is fast and the water is large, the shower room does not leak, and the washbasin is large enough. The Dyson hair dryer helped me a lot, so I decided to include it in the Double Eleven list. It would be perfect if there is an extra big mirror! (Just opposite the long table, on the pillar of the bathtub, the natural light source is more suitable for makeup. I have chosen it for you üòÖ) Because it is inconvenient to use the mirror of the washstand when someone is using the bathroom.
Because the last day happened to be my son's birthday, I made it clear when I made the reservation that I needed help ordering a cake. The hotel not only fulfilled the entrus**ent carefully, but also let me get a super beautiful and delicious cake, and the hotel insisted on not charging, which is really touching. This is definitely something I have earned. I feel the "customer service" in the textbook, You have exceeded your customers‚Äô expectations!
Thanks again to Paddy Field for your enthusiasm and attentiveness, as well as every smiling staff member. You have made me more determined to travel to Yangshuo with peace of mind!
One last little suggestion, if you can place a toilet on the first floor, it will be more convenient for the tenants. Thank you!

msg:In Yangshuo Shili Gallery Scenic Area, it is very close to the Internet celebrity train. The hotel opened for dinner, and the meal fee is 8 yuan per person, including rice and tea. After eating, there is no tea. The platform is pretty good. People who can send a few photos without retouching especially said that it is better not to come during the peak season, and the takeaway can‚Äôt be delivered. The family members suffered from heatstroke and said for a long time that the front desk gave Huoxiangzhengqi water. Thank you. It‚Äôs not worth living in this B&B at this price in summer. The swimming pool is not very noisy. There are children and adults, all of them are just below the room, and there is also a car to go back and forth. The room is relatively large, and the lighting design is okay. I use a Dyson hair dryer. You can only boil a kettle... The facilities are ok. I don‚Äôt know any other good selling points. If the price is high, don‚Äôt ask too many people for the quality of the breakfast.

All the way into Yulong River you see small courtyards. This one looks bigger and has a special design. You can see a building with panoramic glass on the roadside. I asked the front desk and found out that it was this one, but it was full of I can't change my room even if I want to.
Stay in the blind box room honestly, and book a panoramic glass room next time
When you enter the hotel lobby, there is a swimming pool. The lighting is very beautiful at night. If you want to swim, but it rains, you can only get up early in the morning and swim a few laps before having breakfast.
Breakfast is still okay, vegetable salad, yogurt, sliced ‚Äã‚Äãbread, and boiled eggs are all my must-haves, Nice
After taking a walk, there is a gym and a laundry room with complete facilities. My favorite is the outdoor terrace. It happened to be a cloudy day and it was comfortable to sit on all morning.
The service is still good. When I checked in, I was given tips on surrounding tours and some value-added services. It was very considerate. I also booked the tickets for me. It was very worry-free. I like it very much. I will stay here again next time!

If you can‚Äôt get one through the public account, you have to queue up at the pier, so I looked for a hotel near the pier. After looking over and over, I finally found this hotel, and I saw a room with a simple and pure white style. , very special. I wanted to book this style, but it was already booked. Other room types were similar, so I simply booked a blind box random room.
Some people were surprised when they arrived at the store.
The first is the swimming pool in front of the lobby. We arrived at night and the lighting is very beautiful.
Then there are the warm tips pushed by the front desk when checking in, including surrounding tours, check-in tips, travel photography tips, etc. The information is very comprehensive, plus chicken legs
In addition, the room is very clean and large, which shows that the cleaning is very meticulous.
PS: Taking pictures in the Sky Realm on the top floor is very impressive. It seems that everyone is here to take pictures. Almost all appoin**ents were booked in the morning. I finally met the photographer who had a small space, so I quickly made an appoin**ent. Thank you very much. Photographer lady.

1. When we checked in, we carried a large suitcase. We fiddled with the hotel's glass door for a long time before opening it (there were too many things in our hands). The front desk was opposite, and the staff was not busy and would not help open the door.
2. I stayed in a Range Rover 270-degree view room. From the introduction, it was renovated in 2018. I didn‚Äôt expect this room type to have a super smell, as if it had just been renovated. The smell is so strong that when I get up at night and go to the bathroom (the exhaust fan is on in the bathroom), I can still smell the super strong decoration smell when I come out. It feels very unhealthy.
advantage:
1. The room has a beautiful view.
2. The food is good, and the food ordered in the evening tastes good.
3. After checking in, the staff took the initiative to pick up your luggage.

It felt like a waste of their resources. Not bad. Excuse me, hehehe. . . .
Hygiene: very clean, nothing fussy

The whole service process is easy and pleasant, from check-in to check-out, helping with luggage, taking me to the room, introducing me to the room and the nice photo spots in the hotel, all the staff are so enthusiastic, professional and friendly. And the hotel's facilities are too amazing, swimming pool, mahjong room, gym, etc., everything you should have. The most amazing thing is the beautiful scenery around the hotel. The natural scenery is definitely a treasure for photography lovers! Because I have been to Yangshuo many times, and I didn‚Äôt have a tight travel schedule, I drank an afternoon tea at the hotel, which was exquisite and delicious. It was the most comfortable time I have stayed in Yangshuo so many times~ The buffet breakfast tasted good, with a variety of varieties There are many, I heard from the manager that it will continue to improve! The attitude of keeping improving is worth learning for all hotels! Will definitely come again next time!

msg:Real feedback after staying.
Stayed at Paddy Field for two nights and had a very poor experience. I compared several hotels on Ctrip and now I regret staying at Paddy Field. I stayed in a 90-square-meter honeymoon double bed room. The room was no different from the picture, but the facilities in the room can't be described in detail. The bedding is very poor, it may vary from person to person. My sleep was not comfortable at all, not as comfortable as five-star bedding. My neck and shoulders feel stiff when I wake up. The shower head is rubbish, the spray height position is extremely poor, the height adjustment is limited, the water flow is soft, and the ceiling shower head is even worse. The water flow is soft and sp****, and the bathing experience is not as good as Express All Seasons! When the basin faucet is turned on, the water flows everywhere, and the ground is covered with water. The size of the water flow must be adjusted. Can't the bathroom equipment be replaced with a better brand? Is it worth the price? The floor tiles throughout the house were cold and uncomfortable for bare feet. Since the floors are all tiled, can't we get floor heating?
Eating is really worth complaining about. I consulted the front desk customer service before booking. Breakfast is a buffet. I thought it would be rich. The result was a huge disappointment. The bar is three meters long and fifty centimeters wide, and there are two vegetarian dishes. I put four steamer baskets, corn, sweet potatoes, sweet steamed buns, and a bowl of fried rice. I was so shocked that it was outrageous. Was it responding to some kind of frugal virtue? The milk is prepared milk powder and has no milk flavor. But the rice noodles are still good. What‚Äôs even more outrageous is that they charged me two yuan per person for a meal at the hotel at noon! I came to stay in a hotel and ate in your hotel, and you provided a table, but you even asked me to pay for the table. What's shameful is that the table fee is used for cleaning. I'll give you a cleaning salary, right? Your boss's structure is too small. The food is already very expensive, so it would be easier to add the table fee to the food. Since we have already charged the table fee, why not charge another two yuan for the use of tableware per person? If I come to the hotel from outside to eat, I will be charged. If I stay in your hotel and charge a table fee, it is not as good as charging an elevator usage fee.
There are a lot of mosquitoes on the open-air balcony of the room. It is recommended to insert a mosquito repellent on the balcony. When I opened the balcony sliding door, the room was full of mosquitoes, and the electric mosquito repellent was of little use, with big bites followed by small bites. The scenery outside the terrace is rice fields, which is a strain on the eyes.
The service is still there, the room service of a five-star hotel is still available, and the pick-up and drop-off is also pretty good. Basic services in a five-star hotel priced at 1,000 yuan.
There is nothing in the blur bar in the room. Why can't we prepare one portion of welcome fruits a day? Isn't it a waste of money?
In short, for a hotel priced at a thousand yuan price, Paddy Field gave me a very poor experience. I suggest you look at the hotel group and choose some chain hotels of large groups instead of private Internet celebrity hotels. Just forget about the photo, it‚Äôs not worth taking.

msg:During the National Day holiday, I took two children to travel. I booked a two-bedroom and one-bedroom on the top floor for 5800 a night. I stayed for two nights. The scenery was okay. There is a big gap with the real luxury hotels. Many wooden panels in the room are upturned and fall off. The cleaning is simple and rude. There are stains on the bedding. I will forget to spread the towels. The toilet paper in the room at this price does not require the use of Debao, but it can't be the roll paper for this kind of stall goods. The scheduled pick-up and drop-off for Liu Sanjie's performance will actually pick up the wrong guests. We waited in the hotel for 40 minutes. As a result, the car sent another group of guests, speechless! In addition, the souvenir that I said when I booked the room was not given when I checked out. Really can't complain, this price really won't stay for the second time, and I won't recommend friends to live there. When the hotel formed a 6-person butler service group after knowing the reservation, I thought there would be a special surprise, but in the end, the cruel reality shattered my beautiful expectations. I hope the hotel can see the evaluation and work hard Improve the service of the hotel and truly grow into a high-end luxury hotel. Originally, I only wanted to give two stars. Think about giving you a space for growth.

For a clean freak like me, the hotel's hygiene is pretty good. The hygiene in the room is very good, the water in the restaurant and the swimming pool is very clean.
Hotel Location:
The hotel is located in the Yulong River Scenic Spot, next to the Internet celebrity train, and very close to the bamboo raft wharf. We all walked and sat on the bamboo rafts. Other attractions are only a 15-minute drive away from the hotel. It is very important for us to come to Yangshuo for the first time.
Hotel facilities:
We drove an electric car and strolled leisurely in the Yulong River. We passed the many homestays along the way. We felt that the paddy fields were the largest and most complete in scale and facilities, including a gym, laundry room, chess and card room, and parking lot. , There are charging piles, children's playgrounds, restaurants, swimming pools, conference rooms, and tea rooms. This is worthy of praise.
Hotel environment:
The location of the hotel is facing the scenery of the rice fields of the Yulong River. The location is unique. The restaurant lobby is full of green plants, which is a bit like a forest restaurant in Thailand. This is very unique.
hotel service:
The hotel staff are all young sisters and brothers, and they can respond to any requests. Yangshuo West Street, Shili Gallery, and nucleic acid are all free and unlimited transfers. This is really great, and you can save a lot of transportation costs. The key is that there is time left. Yes, we played in Yangshuo for 3 days. The driver was very timely and polite. In addition, there was free travel photography. The photographers were very professional and they were all blockbusters. They asked us where we were shooting in the circle of friends.
In general, the rice field is a hotel that is very worthwhile to stay in again. Thank you for your service these days.

msg:Overall not bad.

There is a swimming pool on the first floor, which is a favorite of children. After staying for one day, the children spent a total of 4 hours in the pool the night before and the next morning.

It is very convenient to have a car to pick up the nearby places. Of course, if it is too far, there will be no pick-up, such as Jinlongqiao Pier. However, Jiuxian Wharf and West Street are all places that can be picked up.

Sending a travel photo is actually the infinity pool on the top floor and the red semi-circular bed that the fairies like. The infinity pool on the top floor should have been out of maintenance, and yellow mud has been seen at the bottom of the pool. Therefore, to achieve the effect on the Internet, you must have a P picture. We need to pay to find them. Of course, the original image is also sent to us, and we can also do it ourselves. The picture I posted was unpublished.

Breakfast buffet, not much variety. Not as good as the 48-yuan buffet at Atour Hotel in Guilin the day before.
The service is normal, not too good, not too bad. After making the reservation, a WeChat group was specially set up for me. I was the only customer, and everyone else in the group was the service staff of the hotel, including the driver, the photographer, the front desk and so on. If I have something to do, I can just say it in the WeChat group.

The sound insulation of the room is not good, I fell asleep at 11:30 and was woken up at 12:00. There was a family on the same floor who arrived at the hotel at 12:00 at night, with children, they didn't pay attention to their words and movements, and the sound was not small. I could hear what they said even when I was lying on the bed.

There is a laundry room, used. Laundry‚ûïdrying is self-service, it will take 3 hours in total, and some clothes are still a little moist after coaxing. There is a gym, but I haven't used it.
The facilities in the room are a bit like a vase. They look good, but they feel awkward to use. Just to give a few examples: 1. There is no place for hooks in the bathroom. I have to go out naked and go to the bed to get my underwear to wear; 2. The body wash, shampoo, etc. used in the bath are placed on the side of the basin and washed. When the water was ready to be wiped, I found out that I had to go out of the shower room to take it. 3. The door of the bathroom is made of wooden sliding rails. It is estimated that it is relatively heavy and has a tendency to break. When it is pulled, the sound is loud. I wake up before the baby in the morning, and I wake up the baby when I go to the toilet. 4. I have all the curtains. I don't know how to turn it off. Finally, after consulting in the WeChat group, I found out that it is controlled by a remote control without any text, and there is no User Manual in the room. 5. The trash can is so small that it will be full after two things are thrown. 6. The power bank only charged one cell overnight. I thought it was my power bank or the charging cable was broken, but it turned out to be no problem when I got home. 7. With such a big bathtub beside the bed (not in the bathroom), I don't know what else to do besides taking pictures. It's just awkward everywhere.

In short, it is suitable for children who want to play in the water, or little fairies who like to take pictures. Others are less suitable.

We Shunde people have some requirements for eating, so we asked the housekeeper to help us find local chicken to eat in advance. Also booked an evening BBQ party and we had the most romantic BBQ ever. Basically, we will help us to do everything we need. It is really responsive, and it is really hard to be a housekeeper.
In addition, the hotel has free breakfast, afternoon tea, and free desserts in the evening. It is really considerate to pick up and drop off when you go out and return to West Street.
There is a pier around the Yulong River, where you can take a bamboo raft. There is a children's playground Q, a coffee shop, a restaurant next to it, it is really convenient to do what you want. Next time I have a chance, I will definitely bring my family to experience it.
To sum up, 99 points for service, 99 points for environment, and one point for them to improve

msg:The Rice Field Hotel is located in the Yulong River Scenic Spot. It takes no more than 20 minutes to go to any scenic spot. The location is really convenient. For the first time in Yangshuo, we really chose the right one. In addition, it is free and unlimited within the county seat. The free pick-up service is really awesome, it is equivalent to a free driver, and the whole process of business car pick-up is both comfortable and safe.
        The most worthy of praise is the free travel photography service. The blockbuster shot at the infinity water pool on the 6th floor left precious memories of our journey. The photographer's skills are very professional, teaching us how to pose and adjust the angle. Very powerful.
     The little butler of the hotel set up a group before we arrived at the store, reminded us of all kinds of precautions, responded immediately if we needed anything, and gave us a lot of play suggestions. The service of the butler at the front desk is worthy of praise.

msg:Hygiene: The hotel is not small, there are many public areas, and the outdoor area is also quite large, basically no garbage and obviously damaged objects can be seen. It is not easy to maintain such a small place.
Facilities: It is worthy of the positioning of a resort hotel. All the necessary facilities are available. Other hotels are equipped with a swimming pool as standard. The good guy has three directly here! I am most afraid that there is no place to charge when traveling by car. The downstairs indoor parking lot is equipped with 4 charging piles, which basically solves my worries about battery life.
Service: This is not to be said. Before moving in, a butler service group will be established first. There are more housekeepers than guests. Basically, if there is a problem, they can be answered in seconds (this is a bit exaggerated, but the efficiency is really high)
Food: Breakfast buffet. The dishes are rich and fresh, and there are refreshments. The guest room offers a fruit basket, drinks, snacks and fruits. Yes, the room is also equipped with a coffee machine and a tea set, which takes into account different taste habits and is very considerate.

And the hotel has a free shuttle bus, and you can also rent an electric car, so you don't have to worry about travel problems.
Environment: complete facilities, a Chinese-style warm style, suitable for dragging a family with a mouth, large rooms, and a white building with a very young style, suitable for couples or newlyweds to spend their honeymoon, rooms in both buildings have refrigerators, Bathtub, Dyson hair dryer, Marshall or Bosch speakers, the configuration is tall. There are also gyms, chess and card rooms, karaoke, etc., first-class standards!
Cleanliness: Very clean and tidy. There are two outdoor swimming pools on the first floor. Basically, the cycle machine is turned on, and a robot continues to work under sleep. I also saw the staff disinfecting the pool water at night. I am very assured of the water quality. According to this, other hygiene standards will certainly not be bad.
Yangshuo Yulong Riverside hotel strongly recommend this one.

And the room is very clean, with complete facilities, a gym, and a children's playroom. It is very suitable for bringing children to stay.

The water was turbid and yellow, and the master came up to see that he didn't wear shoe covers or take off his shoes, so he didn't know what hygiene was. Many lights in the room are broken and have not been repaired. The door of the room is transparent, and there is no transparent glass in the bathroom and shower room, so there is no privacy at all. The maintenance of the hotel is also not well done. They are all shabby and old, and it really feels a little bit cheated by the Internet. Maybe young people will like it, but at the price of 1288 a night, I really think it's not worth it! Super worth it!

If you are bringing children, you can actually choose the parent-child theme, because there is nothing to play here except the swimming pool.
The overall is still good, the soft service needs to be improved.

Anyway, it is relatively spacious, with a 270-degree view, watching the mountains in the morning, swimming in the evening, and afternoon tea in the lobby.

Breakfast is said to be until 10 o'clock. In fact, if you miss it late, you will cook a bowl of Guilin rice noodles.
The tour on the roof is very good. Guests staying in the hotel should not miss it, the infinity swimming pool is very beautiful for taking pictures.
The most touching thing is actually coming out of the scenic spot, and a group of soliciting customers surrounds you and asks you to rent their small battery car or ride their tricycle. You can't push it all the way, and it feels very unsafe. At this time, the hotel driver's little brother Driving a Mercedes-Benz E, handsomely opening the door to pick you up, that feeling...

4. There are charging piles in the parking lot.
shortcoming:
1. The parking lot is small and crowded;
2. The facilities in the main building are aging, and the 1k2 rooms in the summer make me feel that the cost performance is slightly lower;
3. The main breakfast is vermicelli, no cold drinks, no butter scraper...
4. The service of many guests in summer can not keep up, the Internet and reception staff are a little "tired", which is not worthy of the price of summer.
comprehensive:
Coming from the Ciao Qiao Hotel in the urban area, the gap is suddenly much larger. Whether it is facilities or services, the standard needs to be improved. . . . Five stars for the special service (travel photography, pick-up and drop-off from Yangshuo County), but I won't come again next time.

The hotel staff are friendly and professional. Before departure, a WeChat personal butler service group has been established to provide you with hotel-related information.

The hotel provides unlimited shuttle service to the West Street of the county seat. One day, the housekeeper knew that we were going to take a bamboo raft at the Golden Dragon Bridge and offered to pick us up and back, which was really touching.

There is a small pool on the top floor of the hotel, you can take a sky mirror effect.

Each room also provides free travel photography service for photographers within the hotel area for half an hour. I strongly appreciate the hotel photographer No. 029. The photos taken are accurate exposure, well-composed, and can be seen to be professional standards. Friends have been full of praise; come to Yangshuo Don't you just want to take a photo with the beautiful scenery?

üöó Transportation:

In Yangshuo Yulong River Shili Gallery Scenic Spot, a 15-minute drive from Yangshuo County, it has a 180¬∞ panoramic unobstructed Yangshuo iconic landscape, and you will not regret it if you stay in a balcony view room.

üçÉ Environment:

The style of the hotel is large and calm, and it is hidden in the beauty of Yangshuo's mountains and rivers without losing its unique style. The hotel has two room types with completely different styles. This time I stayed in a balcony view room, which is very similar in style to MUJI. For example, the wooden soft decoration gives people a natural and fresh feeling, and the other building is an all-white design environment. If you like the stable wooden style, you can choose the general room type, and you can choose another building if you like the special design style.

üîîService:

The hotel has a private butler service. A few days before arriving at the hotel, the contact information and special needs will be confirmed with the guests, and the front desk will provide travel advice and transportation solutions for the current season. We have a special person to pick up Yangshuo County every day for four days, and the hotel The service of the front desk and the driver is very goodüëçüèª The tickets for the general scenic spot and route planning have given us good suggestions. In the last four days, I feel that I am very familiar with the hotel staff haha! I have to give a thumbs up to all the hotel staff here! The four days we stayed were very good!

In addition, Ctrip's hotel package includes in-hotel travel photography services. Here we recommend photographer 029's eldest brother, who will look for the hotel's classic camera seats to allow guests to leave high-quality photos. The photos are great and you can see the pictures.

üßπHygiene:
The room and dining area are very clean. I have noticed that there is always a very fresh fragrance from the lobby to the room. People who love to visit MUJI should understand that it is an essential oil fragrance similar to their wood. Entering the hotel makes people feel From the sense of smell into a relaxed state, I like it very much.

Finally, to all friends who want to come to Yangshuo, staying in the rice fields will never disappoint you, it is definitely worth it.

The two swimming pools in front of the door are very beautiful with the mountains in the distance. I really want to go into the water, but it's too cold. Let's do it next time.

There are many restaurants around, the 38-degree weather swimming pool is completely unusable, the hot spring is the same, there is no pool filter system, questioning the level of hygiene, and I dare not swim with a swimsuit. The breakfast is good, similar to Vienna, Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. The variety and quality are relatively average, which does not match the price of 1288 per night.

After connecting with my personal butler, I could arrange for free photos. I came to Yangshuo just to see the scenery. It's better to let a photographer take pictures, and teach professional people to do professional things. The exterior of the hotel is so good. When we take pictures, there are people outside who pay to come and take pictures. This is also a gift from nature. Full marks, worth recommending!

This hotel is located near the Jima Wharf of Yulong River. It has a unique geographical location. There is a large paddy field in front of the door, and the mountains in the distance are in good weather. You can watch the sunset directly from the balcony in the room or the terrace by the pool. The view is amazing! The little brothers are all handsome guys~ The service is really good, even better than my boyfriend when I quarreled, haha. There is a car to and from the county, and the items in the room are all big names. In short, for this seemingly high price, it is actually a great value.

If you don't do it, you will pull up my brothers and two people and drive directly. There are very few tourists in Yangshuo now, and the traffic is very smooth all the way. I drove along the road and followed the scenery to a pier near the Yulong River. At first glance, except for the beautiful scenery, this hotel is conspicuous, so I stayed here. There is a rice field hotel. Unexpectedly, there is a hotel with super five-star service in this quiet village! This is a bit incredible. From check-in to check-out, the butlers in the exclusive butler group have been enthusiastically and proactively providing all kinds of useful information. I feel a little flattered. I feel that my mother doesn't care that much about me when I grow up, haha! In addition to the good service, the supplies inside are all big brands, free shuttle service, photographers take pictures, etc. Next time, I will bring my girlfriend here to live and satisfy her desire for artistic photos. By the way, their food is really good. It is said that the chef specially invited from Guangdong. Cantonese food is really authentic. In short, it is one word, good!

I chose the 270-degree view room, the room is big enough and upright, facing the rice fields and the mountains of Yangshuo, you can stay all day without getting out of the hotel room. The Rice Field B&B booked on Ctrip provides unlimited pick-up and drop-off service within Yangshuo County. Whether it is going to West Street or nearby attractions, or drifting, there are hotel-arranged car pick-ups, which is very convenient. There is also a travel shot in the Ctrip package, which is definitely a big surprise. I met the photographer 029, and the light is not bad when I choose the time around 5 o‚Äôclock. 029 The photographer is super professional and constantly guides us how to pose in the most beautiful pose. The photographers are also humorous, so that the whole shooting is not nervous, not boring, and the final blockbuster is really amazing for us. This beautiful memory can be kept in memory forever. Rice Field Hotel has to boast about his personal warm-hearted butler service. Special thanks to Xiao Zhou, the housekeeper who took care of us, a handsome and sunny boy. If there is any problem, I will help solve it at the first time, and I will always smile, giving the feeling of my family. I have stayed in countless five-star hotels at home and abroad, and the service of Paddy Field can be called 7-star. A good housekeeper, a good team, and a good hotel are really a lifetime memory. Would definitely recommend the Rice Field Hotel to other friends. No matter how far Yangshuo is, because the rice fields also feel at home, I hope I can come back and live for a few more days in the future.

The rice field scenery is great. When we arrived, we just met the harvest rice. Breakfast is a bit monotonous, but the rice noodles are great. Gifts sent from the store. Very hearty and local character. A good hotel to stay in.

msg:The biggest unexpected reward of this trip was the discovery of this treasure hotel, the rice field. I never expected that such a high-quality hotel could exist in a village. Since it was the off-season, I paid a few hundred yuan extra to upgrade to a room with a balcony. Looking out from the room, the whole view was beautiful. The hotel has free tea breaks throughout the day. It is very pleasant to have a cup of coffee, taste local handmade snacks, and stare out the window in a daze for an afternoon. If you want to go out, just tell the dedicated butler, and you can pick up and drop off anywhere in the county. You really want peace and quiet and scenery. There is a nice place to take pictures on the roof. There are photographers taking pictures for free, and costumes and props are provided. This is very convenientüëçüèª.

You can pick up and drop off when you travel on West Street. For the first time Northeast people in Yangshuo, the experience should not be too good. There are also electric motorcycle rentals. Bring the kids around to have a meal, play in the water, watch the scenery, and have a swim to watch the sunset and enjoy the rice fields in the evening. The years are quiet!

The Luo Han Guo farmer's dishes are well done. Parking spaces are limited, and parking is not convenient when there are many people. You can contact the housekeeper to lead the way. The breakfast is simple and delicious, the room is well-sanitary, clean and tidy, and the area is large. I stayed at the Rice Field Resort for three days this time and I feel very good. Thanks to the housekeeper Xiao Zhou for his warm reception these days.

The room is large. But the toilet is open. It is inconvenient to use curtains when using it. The amount of water from the shower is really too great. Less, tick and tick, it takes a long time to wash, the sink and faucet are installed misplaced, water will splash out when washing your hands! I don't know how it is usually, but there were many power outages on the night I stayed, which was really bad! The air-conditioning in the room is very cool, but there is basically no air-conditioning in the public areas, which is really hot! The pool water is a bit dirty! The swimming pool still needs to be managed properly!

- The view from the top floor is great! The hotel has a photographer who takes photos and retouches for free. The photography guy 029 is very serious and responsible, and the results are very good.
- The room is decorated in Japanese style, spacious, bright and simple. The details of daily necessities are well done, and the large bathtub is particularly comfortable.
-The free breakfast buffet is of good quality. Congratulations on the rice noodles, they are more delicious than the two restaurants in Guilin!

A good hotel allows late check-out, but the service of this hotel is worrisome. My family is rafting, and the elderly are in the hotel with their children. After swimming, they want to take a rest at noon, but they are all chased out by 17 or 18 phone calls. The experience is particularly bad. . For such an expensive room rate, there is still a big gap in service!

The bad review is for the boss. Due to force majeure, the liquidated damages will be deducted one day in advance and the cancellation of the reservation is not accepted, nor is the rescheduled check-in accepted. Before check-out, I tried to trick customers by saying that I would give you a discount. The premise is to cancel the order and pay in cash. Isn‚Äôt it because you are afraid of giving bad reviews if you cancel the order? You have the skills to trick customers like this. Can you think more from the customer‚Äôs point of view? question? !

msg:Cleanliness and rooms are okay, but this is the breakfast, I can't complain... It's very similar to the breakfast in a guest house, it doesn't match the thousands of dollars. It is also the worst hotel + homestay I have ever stayed in.
