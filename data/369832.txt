msg:Our stay was pleasant and most of the staff were very helpful & friendly. They will greet us whenever we walked pass. Too bad we did not have the chance to enjoy the facilities and dine in the hotel. 
One feedback I had was during our check-in day on 28 Feb 2024. We were not sure if we had arrived at the right hotel as we do not know the hotel's Chinese name. It was raining and I wanted to alight & make a quick check with an older porter at the hotel entrance/drop-off point. When I asked the older porter "ËøôÈáåÊòØ‰∏çÊòØ Okura Garden Hotel?" He just brushed me aside and said "‰∏çÁü•ÈÅì!". In the end I had to dashed into the hotel lobby and reconfirmed with the reception on duty. 
Understand that English may not be a common language for the hotel staff especially the older ones. But won't it make a great difference if the staff at least knows the English name of the hotel that they are working for?

msg:Exterior is 5 star. Interior is 2 star. Service is 1 star. Don't be fooled by the glamorous lobby and magnificent exterior and online pictures. When I arrived for check in, the lady at the reception desk asked me to wait while she finished playing with her phone which was very unprofessional. The first room was dirty with stains on the bed covers and on the towels (see images) and the furniture was aged and shabby. I voiced my dissatisfaction and they brought me to a second room which had even more stains than the first one. I again expressed my dissatisfaction and they brought me to a third room which seemed to be without any visible stains. However, as I was checking the room for cleanliness, the hotel housekeeper was annoyed and muttered some profanity under her breath as she probably thought I couldn't understand Chinese. This is completely unacceptable from any hotel staff let alone from a "five star" establishment in a major city. The only redeeming factor was the concierge who apologized and tried her best to remedy the situation. I originally booked a two night stay but after these experiences, I decided to stay one night (since it was already very late) and amend my booking tomorrow morning. Thankfully the hotel allowed me to cancel the second night but I left feeling dissatisfied and cheated. In total, I had been delayed over 2 hours and had voiced the situation multiple times to the hotel staff and nothing was offered from their end. Perhaps the culture is different in China, but if I saw this level of accommodation in the US I would think that it is a 2 star hotel. As for the service, the valets were very helpful in offering to carry luggage and the concierge was truly apologetic, but the housekeeper and lady at reception displayed behavior that is completely inappropriate.

msg:It's located in the best place in down town Shanghai.  However, the facilities especially the gym and swimming pool are managed very poor. Don't have much expectation if you want to try them.  The breakfast is not worthy after 2-3 days as they don't change at all, plus the waiters/waitresses can be very non-professional.  Cleanness of the room is okay but the house keepers might be very loud in the hall way as if no guest could hear them.  It's not managed and operated by the Japanese hotel group but rather, the local state-owned JinJiang hotel group, which you can image how rediculous from time to time it can be.

Concierge service is good but we think they could be improved by providing more tourist information or places of interest when approached.

I had two pieces of cleaning equipment left in the room on two different days.

The chamber maid didn‚Äôt replenish fresh toilet paper. And there was hair of different color on the towels.  

Evidently the management of the hotel is not what it used to be.

Majority are good. Love the extension room bathtub üõÅ. But is sad as after spa the water have bad suspension sound that causes annoying. That's why dare not to continue on the following day. Staff attitude for entrance need to train more.

If you took taxi here with large luggage at night, better prepare to take luggage yourself to the hotel - no one is helping, the security guard will just stare at you.

We enjoyed breakfast, which had some weestern options, and the gym.
Great location, close to metro stops and a short walk from our favorite restaurants.
The staff was wonderful, solicitous and spoke English well.

msg:This is the second time I have stayed at the Shanghai Garden Hotel in half a month. Because the order included a business meal, when I walked into Rose Coffee, the restaurant manager Gao Yong recognized me at a glance and asked enthusiastically: Ms. H, would you like the beef fried rice from last time, or would you like to try the pasta? I immediately felt at home, very warm. While I was dining, the senior manager was talking freely with the guests at another table in fluent Japanese. The room is fully equipped with all facilities. Although it is an old Japanese-owned hotel, the furniture and sanitary ware are maintained as clean as new. The hotel is located on Maoming South Road, and there are many shops along the way. You can take photos of the window displays. The hotel's appearance is especially beautiful at night. Because the Shaanxi South Road Subway Station is just a stone's throw away, it is very convenient for guests to travel to various attractions. The hotel is very close to Jinxian Road. Because I have watched the Shanghainese version of "Flowers" twice, even though I only stayed for one night, I still visited this small street for a while in the evening. The hotel's breakfast is very rich and delicious. If I bring my children to Shanghai during the summer, I will still choose to stay at the Garden Hotel. The price/performance ratio here is really great.

The lobby is always messy, there are many management and service staff, it's just messy.

If we didn't check in, we had to queue up again. Then we stored our luggage and went out to eat. At about 1:45, we went to the front desk again, and it was the same. We didn't check in until 2 o'clock (we just wanted to register the information, not to check in immediately, and we could enter the room after 2 o'clock). Then we waited on the sofa again. A few minutes after 2 o'clock, we queued up at the front desk again and were told that the previous guest checked out late and had to wait. I lost my patience and said that it was so difficult to check in. Can you fill in the information first, and then notify me to get the room card at the front desk? Do I have to queue up several times? Then the front desk finally checked in, and I waited on the sofa to be notified to get the room card. In the end, I got the room 25 minutes late, and nothing was said. I remember that I was given a room 1 hour late at InterContinental Shenzhen, and they immediately upgraded me and gave my child a free breakfast. I am really impressed by the front desk service at the Garden Hotel. In addition, the room is quite comfortable and the hotel is conveniently located. The evaluation is over.

msg:I stayed in 1110, which is very close to the elevator hall, convenient and not noisy; the hotel is 33 stories high (there are French restaurants, teppanyaki, and lounges on the rooftop, and you can go there directly without reservation on weekends)
The facilities in the room are very convenient and clean, but many items are over 30 years old, it feels like traveling back to the late 1980s;
The environment inside and outside the hotel is orderly and tidy, and it can be seen that it is well maintained, worthy of being a hotel funded by Nomura Securities.
The Internet-famous grape cakes of the Garden Hotel have become more rational now, but they are still delicious. The preferential direct purchase without reservation was not used, and the half-and-half grape cakes were given one less grape flavor, which was a bit unhappy...
The hotel provides 24-hour Chinese and Western food delivery, which is very suitable for business travelers
The location is extremely convenient. Whether you go to Jing'an Temple, Nanjing West Road, the Bund, or Wukang Road, you can ride the subway, and many Internet-famous restaurants such as Jinxian Road, Jinjiang Hotel, and Cathay Cinema are all close at hand. The farther ones, An Niang Noodle House, Sinan Road, Huaihai Road Paris Spring, Xingye Taikoo Hui, and Jiaxiuli Mao Zedong's Former Residence are also within a 15-minute walk;
In terms of price, the room rate of more than 700 yuan without breakfast is also competitive;
There is also a corridor on the first floor to promote the history of construction;
As well as Japanese food, simple Western food, and lobby bar
Check-out can be delayed until 2 o'clock.
Perfect
Next time I will bring my parents to stay.

[Good points]

- Hotel staff can speak some Japanese

- Located in the center of Shanghai, so there is no problem with eating and shopping

- Historic hotel with classic interior but clean

- Toilet with washlet

[Points to note]

- Breakfast is only available at the buffet on the first floor

- Breakfast at the Japanese restaurant on the second floor, which was previously there, is no longer available

[Overall review]

It seems that the name remains the same and the capital has been transferred to the Jinjiang Group, but the quality of service seems to have been maintained, so I would recommend it.

Many people come to the garden to check in and take pictures. The front desk said it will be more beautiful in May.
It is very good to visit nearby.

The room is hygienic, clean, bright and has no peculiar smell.
The only drawback was that around 10 a.m. on the day I left the hotel, I was sorting out information. The sudden sound of an electric drill was somewhat disturbing. Would it be better if the staff informed me in advance?
All in all, it was still a very satisfying stay.

When Mr. Zhang at the front desk saw us bringing an elderly person to the hotel, he considerately upgraded us to a room considering the safety of the elderly person (it was inconvenient to get in and out of the bathtub). There was a waiter next to the elevator who saw us. When a guest approaches, he will immediately press the elevator button for you.

If you drive there, in addition to the parking lot in front of the garden, there is also a tennis court building behind it (a five-story vertical garage). It is not too late when you come. But the ground was full, so I went to the latter's garage. There were quite a lot of parking spaces. Parking was 20 yuan an hour, but it was free for hotel and restaurant guests. After checking in, we went to the room. The room was quite spacious and faced the park below, so it was quite quiet. The room attendants were all very warm and kind (the work clothes were also very nice, even though they were all short-sleeved, my mother still cared about whether they would get cold). When we were about to check out and leave the room, the waiter on the side told us that we are welcome to stay in the garden again next time. hotel!

As a southerner, I feel it is too dry and hot. The bedding and sheets are also the harder ones found in older hotels. I feel like they could be replaced with softer products as time goes by.

People asked her three times what she was talking about, but she still kept humming. She couldn't understand what she was doing at the front desk.
People go to bed at noon. The housekeeper almost rings the doorbell. Is there anyone who can teach guests that they can go in and do hygiene in the room?
The air conditioning was so bad that both of us had a fever the next day.
I stayed for four days in total and called the front desk n times. Are you busy at work? Do you feel uncomfortable if you don‚Äôt find some work for yourself? You need to communicate with me about everything. Where do I have time to chat with you?
When I renewed my stay on Ctrip, I was told that I couldn't find the information and I had to talk to me. I called him and said I didn't know how to renew. After a while, I called back and said that you had found it again. I would like to ask if you are smart when you work. Where can I find this? Many people gather together

He told more than a dozen people traveling with him that they were waiting in line and asked the counter. Let‚Äôs do it together or one by one. As a result, the inattentive counter staff checked them in first. We told another counter staff that we were unhappy about being cut in line by that group of people. The staff said that if we were not unhappy, they would upgrade us to a higher class and gave us candies. But the training of service personnel should be strengthened. We discovered that the air conditioning in the room was not cold, so we asked the hotel staff to come and take a look. First, an aunt came and told us that the temperature control of the central air conditioner had not reached the temperature, so there was no air conditioning. We told her that the rooms next door were colder than ours (we were second-year students). Only then did she want to ask people to come and see. Two people came and looked here and there. When they were about to leave, one of them opened the maintenance hole in front of the door, took off the filter, and said something in their language, As a result, the aunt and one of them whispered to him to put it back. When I saw and heard it, I asked my aunt if the filter was in place. She replied that everything had been taken care of (dare you say it). I asked if I would be allergic and would you like to change the filter for me. At my insistence, she asked the waiter to come and replace the filter with a new one (the room was just that) getting cold). Therefore, travelers who check in must adhere to the requirements and do not be embarrassed to report them. The two stars for service are for the service staff who helped us.

The service staff are well-trained and very polite. The breakfast is very rich. I wonder if the hotel is owned by a Japanese person, because many of the hardware are Japanese brands. The public restrooms also have a Japanese sophistication, with separate dressing stalls, and some Japanese meals are available for breakfast. Of course, there are quite a lot of Japanese guests, and we also see European and American guests. Staying in this season is in the center of Huaihai Road. It is very convenient to go to the nearby city walk with Shanghai characteristics and the price/performance ratio is very high.

The room given is on a higher floor and has a night view. When the curtains were opened at night, my husband and I couldn't help but exclaimed, wow, it's so beautiful. If you look at it from a good angle, you can even see the Oriental Pearl Tower. The top 33rd floor of the hotel is a bar. We are not very good at ordering but the clerk enthusiastically recommends small drinks. There is a high proportion of foreigners here, the waiters can all communicate in English, and the Japanese-style breakfast is very interesting. In addition, this is a very popular wedding banquet venue. There are many guests coming and going on weekends, and it is very lively.

After staying for three days, the room was cleaned in time and daily necessities were replenished and replaced every day.
On the last day of check-out, I discussed with the front desk whether I could check out an hour late, and was readily agreed. Definitely worth staying again in terms of service.

Facilities: The management should really stop resting on its laurels and rely on existing infrastructure and services to attract guests. Please check if the bathroom facilities should be updated. Although it can be seen that the staff have tried their best to maintain them, they should also invest in replacing the facilities. necessary.

It is in a bustling location and has easy access to the subway. You can go on a CityRide, have a coffee or talk shop wherever you go. The courtyard in front of the door is the best attraction on this trip, with rich vegetation and a kitten to play with next to the fountain. The hotel has a solemn and classic environment, with modern European and Showa style decoration. I changed rooms midway and thanked the specialist who helped transfer my luggage for making my trip worry-free. The guest room is quiet, clean and orderly, and the cleaning lady is very enthusiastic. We recommend the Rose Cafe buffet breakfast and room service, which are a little expensive but worth the experience.

The most surprising behavior was the gentleman at the door when we left: when he saw our car coming, he turned his head to the other side. He didn't help us with our luggage. He didn't even say hello, let alone goodbye. Welcome again. Words like "come" directly treat us like air. It‚Äôs not that we need help with our luggage, it‚Äôs just that we are used to the courtesy of being greeted by other hotel employees, and we didn‚Äôt expect to encounter such employees.

If you need to face the south, you need to pay the hotel a 100 yuan price difference per night. Considering the comfort of parents and children, we paid a 200 yuan price difference and then asked for an invoice. The hotel staff said that the electronic invoice machine was broken and they would give it to us when we got back. We mail it. We checked out on the 23rd and haven't received it yet. I asked the hotel staff today and they gave me various suggestions. I would like to ask why Ctrip didn't indicate that the deluxe rooms booked on the platform are all facing north. It wasn't until we went to the hotel that we learned that if we wanted to face south, we needed to pay the price difference, which made us so troublesome.

The most terrible thing is that the temperature and air volume of the central air conditioner cannot be adjusted in the room. It's okay if I'm covered with a quilt, but it's too cold to stay without a quilt, and the noise also affects my sleep.

Hygiene: The bathroom didn't seem to be cleaned with much care. I'm a bit of a germaphobe. I wiped it with alcohol cotton and found some dust and hair on the countertop...

Environment: The window of the room faces the garden, with a good view (although there is no chance to enjoy it).

Service: Japanese-owned hotel, with many Japanese choices for breakfast. The front desk service attitude is quite good, and late check-out is available.

Another thing worth commending is Ms. Zong at the front desk of the hotel. Her service attitude was very good during both stays. She was thoughtful and attentive, neither humble nor overbearing. Even when her daughter‚Äôs mobile phone failed to connect to the Internet, she patiently called to help solve the problem. The front desk was very busy during the Spring Festival.

msg:I am a resident of Shanghai city, but I haven‚Äôt gone shopping on Huaihai Road for a long time, probably 10 years. Thinking about the Spring Festival, the whole family stayed in a hotel near Huaihai Road, lazing around and shopping. I have experienced the more authentic Japanese service at the Garden Hotel in the past. This Spring Festival, I chose the Garden Hotel and booked three deluxe rooms to experience it again. When I arrived at the hotel, I learned that the property rights of the Garden Hotel had been returned to Jinjiang Group, but the Japanese side was still managing it. I was a little worried about the change in service. After staying at the store for a few days, I found that the service has not changed much, and it is still Japanese-style "**". Here are two examples: 1. Although it is winter, my wife always complained that the room temperature was too high after checking in, so she went through all the hotel rooms and the engineering depar**ent. In the end, because there were no windows in the guest rooms, the central air conditioner could not adjust the temperature to be consistent between the upper and lower floors. It should be good. So I simply moved a water-cooled fan and placed it in the room to cool down. The wife is at peace. 2. The old mother relied on an electric scooter when she went out. When she came back from shopping, she found that a screw was missing from the seat back of the scooter and it was shaking. Go to the hotel lobby for help. Several lobby managers found a bunch of nuts and screwdrivers from the tool room, repeatedly adapted them one by one, and finally repaired it. Looking at the busy work of several gentlemen in suits and leather shoes, bent over and kneeling, I was really surprised and grateful. The "**" of this Japanese-style service is indeed admirable but also makes us a little afraid of this neighbor's social and professional style.

First of all, the location is excellent, a few hundred meters away from Exit 3/4 of South Shaanxi Road Station, and it is located on the beautiful Maoming Road. What impressed me the most was the quality and spiritual outlook of the hotel service staff. Everyone was polite, warm and welcoming, including the room service aunt. Many details are very heartwarming. The weather is hot, and we have a large number of guests. After cleaning, the aunt always takes the initiative to give us several times the usual amount of bottled water. Because of the itinerary, we went to the front desk to apply for late check-out. Before we got to the front desk, a gentleman (lobby manager?) warmly greeted him and asked if he needed help. I said my request, and he Immediately said that he would talk to the front desk, so I could rest assured. When checking out the store, Ms. Ma Simin at the front desk was also very warm and polite, and took the trouble to meet the requirements. Of course, the hardware of the hotel is also good. The room given to us is a high-rise non-smoking room according to our requirements. It is also a garden room facing the big garden and Huaihai Road. The breakfast buffet is also very good, with delicious Japanese ingredients, smoked salmon, cheese, well-made bread and pastries. I will definitely live here again next time I come to Shanghai.

msg:Very, very, very bad check-in experience, it is a hotel that only serves Japanese people attentively
The thing is, I checked out today. When I checked in, I asked the front desk clearly whether there was a fee for the refrigerator in the room. The front desk also clearly answered that it was free, and there was a companion to testify. However, when I checked out, the front desk told me that I needed to charge, which made me pay extra Expenses, and I also paid the fee and they issued a receipt. As a result, one hour after leaving the store, the hotel did not know who called me, saying that I was not charged for using the refrigerator, and said that the front desk did not find the charge record and added me privately. wx asked me to send them a screenshot of the transaction!
Such a way of handling is the level that an old hotel in Shanghai should have? Or are Chinese guests not guests?
Originally it was a small amount of money, but this kind of service really sucks, I won't come again, and I won't recommend friends to stay
Secondly, I emphasized the taste when I bought the hotel‚Äôs Internet celebrity biscuits, and I got it wrong. The clerk in this store can‚Äôt only hear Japanese, right?
Very disappointed very despised üëéüèª

But this time it was really disappointing!
Not as good as an ordinary hotel!
Facilities are complete and old, not to mention the small room! The geographical location is unique!
Donghu Hotel does not have twin rooms!
Actually opened a room for me because other guests are already checking in! omg! Such a low-level mistake! Then the front desk manager upgraded the room type! That customer was embarrassing too! Then the front desk was very busy! Keep you waiting!
Saying that I can't call back after a while, I won't call back at all, and I will confirm it when I get angry, rushing to the meeting! He just won't answer! You can't go out either! Because you can continue to live!
Then leave the store to give a parking ticket, my foot hurts! The front desk gave the wrong date ticket, and I had to go back and forth to change it by myself! Is the front desk working with a brain? The security guard didn't help to change it either!
Then go to the airport and leave the phone at the hotel! Call back, someone will answer the switchboard! Transfer to the front desk mine to transfer more than a dozen ‚òéÔ∏è, no one answered for a long time!
This hotel works! Makes people so speechless!
The executive double room is much smaller than other hotels of the same level! It's not as big as a luxurious big bed!
Anyway! Never want to live here in Shanghai again!
The picture below shows that once the door is opened, it is the room of the guests who have already checked in. The front desk can also give room cards to new guests, and old customers also have room cards in the house! It really makes me feel that the front desk has no brains

After a few sentences of reasoning, he started to show us disdain with his hands behind his back, asking us to talk to the people above us if we had any questions. We found the front desk, and a woman with short hair and glasses rolled her eyes at us. Finally, a male manager wearing glasses came out to explain, and his attitude was very tough and bad.

I can change the room. I was very tired when I arrived at the store, and I didn't want to bother with my children, but I think There is no basic etiquette of apologizing. After all, it is a five-star hotel, and sanitation management is the most basic. Is it rare for a guest to come and see it for a second cleaning? I stayed for three days, and the waiter made the quilt once. The breakfast waiter is very mechanical. If you bring a child a little over, you must buy a ticket. When you enter the restaurant, you have to pay before you sit down. Since the requirements for guests are so strict , Why are you not so strict with your own service and hygiene requirements? There is no price tag or price list for the drinks in the refrigerator. Is this free consumption or what? The service recommendation of the Japanese grocery store, the taste and service are very good, and the biscuits are also delicious.

At the same time, there are many restaurants on Changle Road, and there are several restaurants with high ratings on Jinxian Road.
Facilities: The room is relatively large, with very nice furniture, the workmanship is particularly good, and it is very comfortable to live in. From the room, you can see the Jinjiang Hotel and the high-rise buildings on Huaihai Road. The view is invincible!
Hygiene: Hygiene is very good. The bathrobes are sealed with dust bags. This is very special and necessary. There is no such setting in other five-star hotels.
Service: There are a lot of guests coming and going in this hotel, and some of them are probably here for a meeting, so there is no waiter at the door, and it is said that they cannot handle it. This needs to be improved, and the lobby service needs to be further strengthened to improve the quality and service capabilities of service personnel. It is also necessary to carry out systematic training and management for waiters, so that their attitudes are more humble and positive; at the same time, the processing speed of front desk personnel is improved. Otherwise, I'm sorry for the history and elegance of the Garden Hotel. Hotel breakfast is not good enough, not tasty, nothing to eat.
Special praise: When I checked in, I arranged to go to the side facing the garden. Later, I continued to stay. Although the room type was sold out, I still gave a very suitable price and added breakfast. Two employees said that I have stayed many times, I am a member, and they are very friendly to me.
Summary: This hotel is full of historical precipitation from time to time, and the decoration and design are very exquisite. It is a kind of luck to live in such a historical and tasteful hotel, and we are grateful!

The facilities in the hotel room are relatively old. When the quilt is opened, it feels crumpled as if someone has slept on it. Overall, it's not bad
The location of the hotel is also very good, you can walk to Anfu Road and the surrounding shopping malls, just use it as a citywalk

I remember that it used to be managed by JAL, and the quality was excellent. This stay was very pleasant and added to the fun of our trip to Shanghai. The location is convenient, not far from Huaihai Road, there are many options for going in any direction. Take the subway or ride a shared bicycle or walk according to your mood. We have basically traveled around the hotel for the past three days. The room facilities are indeed not too new, but the service is really good, the front desk is very polite, Manager Huang saw that we took the children and changed to a standard room on the 31st floor, and put two beds together, which is very comfortable. The night view on the top floor of the hotel is beautiful, and the garden in front of it is very interesting to stroll around in the morning. It is unique to have such a green space in the downtown center of Shanghai. The breakfast is very rich, both Chinese and Western. Thanks to everyone at the Garden Hotel for leaving us with a wonderful impression of Shanghai

Reasons for choosing a garden:
1. Good location. I love Huaihai Road so much! And the hotel itself is a historical building, a part of the history of Huaihai Road.
2. Good view. The window of this stay faces the direction of Huaihai Road, on a high floor, you can enjoy the large garden and street view.
3. The water from the tap can be drunk directly. If the weather is hot, it is very convenient to drink water, which is especially good.
4. Convenient transportation.
Insufficient: I feel that the details are reducing the cost
1. A pair of slippers are provided for single rooms. There are no replacements after bathing, so you need to ask the service desk for them.
2. I didn't see the iron, ironing board, or safe in the closet this time, so I remember both, or did I change places? The bed seems to be smaller than before, but it is still within the acceptable range.
Overall satisfied, a great holiday.

msg:Actually I don't want to give it half a star
The story is this: I stayed here for two nights. When I checked in, the front desk waiter told me: I can choose the buffet on the first floor or the Japanese set meal on the second floor for breakfast, but because it is not included in the room rate, children need to pay separately.
The next morning, fearing that there would be too many people on the first floor, we went to the second floor to prepare for the set meal.
As soon as I arrived at the door, the receptionist greeted me and didn't say anything else. I said, is the child not included in the room rate? I will pay for it separately.
At this time, the receptionist asked, what room number are you in? I reported the room number, and she seemed to be looking for something. At this time, a person who looked like a supervisor rushed out of the restaurant and shouted at us: Children are not allowed! 
I was stunned at the time, what is not allowed?
At this time, she rushed over and said that the room rate does not include children and they cannot eat for free. I said I know, isn't it time to pay? In fact, my mobile phone had already opened the QR code at that time. The supervisor sister still expressed to me excitedly: "The third person cannot eat for free if the room rate does not include it." I said I knew it yesterday. She asked what room number are you in? The attitude was very stiff, and I said I had just reported it to the waiter. The supervisor said no, you have to swipe the card! 
From the time I entered the restaurant, the room number, to the supervisor rushing over, no one told us "you need to swipe the room card to eat!" 
At this time, in order not to affect today's itinerary, we didn't want to argue with her, I said I could eat if I could, and I would leave if I couldn't eat! She seemed to see something was wrong, so she explained: A set meal is more, and it would be a waste if the child couldn't finish it by himself, so you can try it first, and you can buy more if it's not enough. 

If this is what she meant from the beginning, I wouldn't give it 0.5 stars. There is no standard service language, no standard service process, and no basic respect for customers. It is the worst failure of this Shanghai trip! 

This is not over yet. When we were seated, a Japanese family came in from behind. The supervisor immediately changed her face, nodded and bowed to greet and say hello, which was a 180-degree change! It seems that the mini booth incident at the Shanghai Auto Show is still happening at every angle and every moment in life. This lady, as your Chinese compatriot, is really disappointed and heartbroken

The room facilities are a bit old, the service can only be said to be average, and more than half of the people are arrogant. For example, when I went to the concierge and asked if I could get biscuits from the lobby bar, an older, slightly bald man glared and said that you'd better make an appointment to get them. I called before, and the waiter told me on the phone that I could stay in the hotel without an appointment, but now it has changed. The key attitude is very tough.
The opening hours of the lobby bar are 10 am to 7 pm, which means that if you need to buy biscuits, this day is basically wasted.

I want to cancel the order I bought on the mini program, because the time in Shanghai is full and I can't pick it up at all. I was told that I have to wait until the 4th to go to work before I can refund it.
I have traveled to so many cities all over the world, and it is really the first time I have encountered such an arrogant hotel. I don't know if I don't stay there. The service industry is really ** to the sky.
Only the waiter who cleans the room and the security guard at the door are gentle and polite. Other staff members who have a little authority basically look down on people.
There will be no next time

msg:This hotel is amazing, a**ospheric, comfortable, and convenient. I feel great living here. I picked it out of many hotels because of its history. I thought the hotel should be old, but I didn't think that everything was well preserved, with a modern a**osphere in its simplicity. The external environment of the hotel is commendable. The garden is huge, shady with trees, and winding paths lead to secluded places. Walking in it is like entering a forest. The huge fountain makes the hotel look lively and natural. The hotel is very thoughtful for the guests, with a complete range of items, spacious rooms, comfortable beds, practical refrigerators, and lights with appropriate brightness. Whether it is night or day, the scenery outside the window is beautiful. The bathroom is great, with a large area, separate functional areas, sufficient water flow, and convenient washing. Even the toilet seat is heated by electricity, which is very satisfying. The hotel's afternoon tea is also very good, with an elegant environment and special butter biscuits, which are specially served to the staying guests. The hotel's service is warm and thoughtful, and the cleaning staff are also very nice, and any needs are met in a timely manner. There is also transportation, three subways pass here, and it is very fast to go anywhere. There is a large parking lot with plenty of parking spaces. In a metropolis like Shanghai, clean and tidy hotels abound, but there are not many hotels with a specific history and such a huge garden. When choosing a hotel, cost performance is the most important factor, and Shanghai Garden Hotel has super high cost performance.

I can make coffee. I asked for a cup of coffee and said no, but the old gentleman next to me refused to give it. Later, the old gentleman called an older male waiter to call.

And there is a seal on the dust bag
The whole looks brand new!

I didn‚Äôt want to say anything more, but when I checked Xiaohongshu and saw someone eating plastic in Huoshaoyun, I searched for 12315 Positive To fight for my own rights, I feel that my experience needs to be seen by more people.
I checked in on the evening of March 11th and checked out at noon on March 12th. When I got home on the evening of the 12th, I remembered that my newly purchased wallet was lost in the hotel. My husband and I both remembered it very clearly. The shopping bag was placed next to the TV. I called the Ctrip platform hotel at 8 a.m. on March 13. The reply was that there was no one in the housekeeping depar**ent office and I was waiting for someone to reply to me. When no one contacted me at 9 o'clock, I called again and finally someone answered and said that a wallet was indeed lost in the room. I asked them to send it for me. The staff who answered the phone said that they were not responsible for sending it and asked me to send it myself. Just go get it with SF Express.
Every sentence shocked me about the service of the Garden Hotel. First of all, why didn't the guest take the initiative to contact the guest when he found something missing in the room? Secondly, shouldn't he offer to send it or provide other solutions if something is missing? A colleague lost his charger plug when he was staying at a chain hotel in a township on a business trip. He took the initiative to contact him and confirmed whether he had received it after sending it. Finally, he commented on the behavior of the Garden Hotel on Xiaohongshu and received many replies saying that this hotel has no sense of service and service. Multiple likes.

msg:An old five-star hotel, the surrounding transportation and shopping environment is invincible. The Huaihai Road business district is located in a quiet location. It was originally a club in the French Concession, and later it was the headquarters of the Japanese invaders. Therefore, the hotel has a strong French and Japanese style. Now it is one of the important destinations for island countries to come to Shanghai. The biggest highlight of the hotel is the unique garden green space, with towering green trees and green grass, which seems to be the urban Eden, making the hotel guests linger and forget to return. The indoor facilities are a little bit old and quite satisfactory. There are some dead ends in individual sanitation, and the details of dust and stains need to be paid attention to. The service is first-class, the training is well-trained, the hotel has stored value discounts but the promotion is not enough, we spent more than 10,000 yuan in the restaurant, and if we know in advance, we can save more than 3,000 yuan, which is a pity. In short, the flaws do not conceal the advantages. For the more affordable price of the hotel, it is definitely the first choice for shopping and tourism in Shanghai.

The lady at the front desk knew that our baby was celebrating his birthday and helped us upgrade the room, so that our baby could appreciate the origin of Shanghai, known as the oriental night Paris. The Chinese dishes in the evening are delicious Incomparably, this restaurant with mediocre taste can't be cooked. The only meal is that the 30% service fee is too expensive, and there is no service.

The hotel has a lot of history. It used to be a French club. The lobby is still a two-story building. The guest rooms are a newly built building behind the lobby. Although it is very old, it is really well maintained! There is no hygienic dead angle at all, and there is no equipment noise at all! The bath water is also very big! The front desk was warm and thoughtful, and gave a brief introduction to every restaurant and historical gallery in the hotel. There are many Japanese people living in this hotel, and the lady at the front desk can switch Japanese at any time without any pressure. In the morning, when I went downstairs to the elevator hall, the concierge said good morning gently, very warm! nice~
The night view at night is very good, because I was upgraded to the executive floor for free. I can see the bustling night view of Yan'an Elevated Road and Nanjing West Road. Standing in front of the glass window, I can see Shanghai's past and present, history and modernity. My husband said something : Shanghai is mine, and I am yours. It's also straight and romantic üåπ
The only thing that makes people speechless is that the bathrobes are charged separately! It feels a bit different from the thoughtfulness and positioning of this hotel

On the first morning after checking in, I was woken up by the staff loudly answering the phone at the door, which lasted for a long time. I couldn't bear it and went out to stop it, denying it in every possible way. After making a complaint over the phone, the housekeeping supervisor came up, and the housekeeper continued to deny everything, claiming that she "didn't say anything, just answered the phone." She asked how she managed to answer the phone without speaking. ? The housekeeping supervisor only acquiesced in watching the housekeeper's denial without making any attempt to stop him. It wasn't until the problem was escalated to the room manager that it was dealt with seriously and the cleaning staff was removed.
On the third night, I told the front desk not to separate the two beds in my room and not to tuck the quilt under the mattress. On the fourth night, I found that they didn't do it. I called the switchboard again to tell them, but they still didn't do it on the fifth day.
Every night when I come back, I have to pull out the quilt and make the two single beds into one big bed. It's really frustrating! I called again to request, and the switchboard Chen Ming said that he would convey his opinions and ask the room manager to call back and apologize. I made it clear, "Don't call back," and repeatedly emphasized, "I have a weak heart and am afraid of noise. I'm very busy on weekdays, so don't come to me. I will stay until the weekend." Six, we‚Äôll talk about it on the weekend,‚Äù I emphasized again and again! ! And repeatedly confirmed with her that she had written it down! !
The next morning, the violent ringing of the phone woke me up from my sleep. I sat up suddenly... When I picked up the phone, I was told that I was here to apologize? ? ? ? ? I really have never experienced anything so outrageous! ! This resulted in palpitations, rapid heartbeat, cold hands and feet, and even trembling fingers all day long.
I have always had feelings and affection for the Garden Hotel, and I often come here to buy biscuits, but I didn‚Äôt expect that I would encounter such bad intentional harm on my first stay! ! I am extremely disgusted and resistant to this Ms. Chen Ming, and I have negative comments about the professional level and professional quality of the front-line staff of the Garden Hotel. As someone who often travels on business and travels and is very familiar with hotel services, I can guarantee that the Garden Hotel The level of front-line employees is seriously lower than the industry average! Bad review! I will definitely not recommend my colleagues or friends to stay here!

Special thanks to Mr. Zhang and Ms. Le at the front desk, who patiently introduced various facilities and delicacies. The only fly in the oin**ent is that the seats are limited, and each delicacy needs to be reserved in advance.
The podium building is a century-old building, while the main building is a modern building. The various indoor facilities may not be the most fashionable, but they are the most practical and considerate.

I thought I could take a rest in the room, but was told by the front desk that my aunt was in the sun, and no one cleaned it. It would be noon at the earliest I can only check in at twelve o'clock. I thought the occupancy rate was very high, and I understand it, but in the next few days, I found that the occupancy rate was very low. Could it be that there are no vacant rooms on the first day to check in early? There must be, but the front desk is unwilling to let What can you do when you check in, we have to walk on the street for several hours to check in, speechless. Then, no aunt will come into the room to clean in the past four days. We will sign an agreement when we check in, and we will not inform you in advance. The third dissatisfaction is that the takeaways are not allowed to be delivered to the lobby, they can only be placed on the ground outside the iron gate next to the street, hehe, so these four days we have been going to the street to pick up our own takeaways, I don‚Äôt understand why Can't it be delivered to the lobby? What happened to the lobby? Respond to the front desk, saying that it was decided by the high-level... Then even if this is the case, don‚Äôt you know how to put a small table at the gate? It made everyone go to the ground to pick up takeaways. You should really let your high-level executives come to live in your own hotel. The fourth point, the four-day room fee is less than 3,000, and the deposit is 4,500. You said it will be refunded. Well, why don‚Äôt you charge 200,000? It will be refunded anyway. Which hotel still charges a deposit now? My God, the platform you booked will deduct the fee after you leave the store. This kind of old hotel should really learn from the service of the new hotel. Don‚Äôt think that you are so great. What happened before? How about it.

msg:I have to rush back to Guangzhou for the Mid-Autumn Festival, but I still have a day at the Time Garden Hotel to feel the good times.
As for Shanghai, I am as familiar as my hometown, or I choose Shanghai to travel alone, or when I go to Jiangsu, Zhejiang or Shandong, I detour to Shanghai and then go back to Guangzhou. I love this city so much, and I travel like this. Staying for a few days or a day, choosing a hotel you like, you don't have to go to various Internet celebrity roads and shopping malls, it is also a very pleasant thing to relax in the hotel quietly.
This time I chose the Garden Hotel. Because I have read the news, I no longer belong to the Okura Group, and I really want to come here to experience the French-Japanese fusion of Shanghai's culture.

However, the friendly hospitality of the hotel is still in the air.
This time I booked a package to upgrade to a deluxe room.
Here are a few particularly impressive service staff:
The switchboard was also a girl from the service center after she moved in. Although she had never met, her voice was sweet, gentle and considerate.
The girls at the front desk are also warm and friendly.
Later, when I wrote a review, I called the front desk again to inquire. This time it was a boy who was also very polite. I also called the room manager, remember Mr. Luo, very polite, friendly and enthusiastic.
The waiter at the gym was a boy, but he was very attentive and enthusiastic. He also took me to the swimming pool and allowed me to take pictures, of course I just took selfies.
The only regret is when I asked if I could take a selfie as a souvenir? The security guard said that the hotel lobby is not allowed. Maybe I brought a tripod myself, which was misunderstood as a commercial shoot, but I was allowed to take a few simple photos later. Although I understand it, it still affects my mood a little when I hear it being said that there is a fee for taking pictures here.

surroundings. This is where my heart is. I love the fusion of classic and stylish. This is the old Shanghai French Club, a baroque building, and a hotel managed by the Japanese Okura Group. It is really a beautiful combination of French and Japanese styles. I love it, except to sit down or stroll and enjoy it, and then take all kinds of photos, use the camera to keep every second of the past, and enjoy it slowly when I get home.

inside the room. The bathroom is not very big, but very clean with a bathtub and shower area. Toilets are smart. The rattan frame for the clothes is very Japanese. It also comes with a yukata robe and a nice flower shopping bag. The three bottles of mineral water are marked with the Garden Hotel, and the water in the tap is sterilized.
Other furnishings are also Japanese style, but the occasional embellishment is luxurious, which is my favorite style.
Wonderful window view. Outside the window is a lush green garden, where there are weddings, high-rise buildings and low-rise row houses with red roofs.

The hotel also has a garden, it's fun to take a walk, and there are little squirrels. Because I checked in by myself, I didn't dare to come out at night, so this time I didn't appreciate the neon glowing Garden Hotel in the night.

FOOD. I wanted to go to the Rose Hall for lunch, but it was already fully booked. Come to this buffet breakfast the next day. At first glance, the variety on the dining table is few and simple. But after trying one by one, I was very full, and there were several varieties that I couldn't eat. The waiter in the Rose Hall is wearing a floral shirt, which is quite stylish, and the service of the chef and the waiter is very good. The breakfast tastes good too. He also patiently helped to take pictures.

I would like to thank the Garden Hotel for the good memory it has left me, and add another good impression to my favorite Shanghai. I look forward to staying here next time when I come to Shanghai or change lanes.

I feel that Ctrip's score of 4.6 is a bit low, and it sometimes affects the choice. For example, at the beginning, I was worried, worried that spending money would affect my mood, just because I like this historic house.

Staying is still highly recommended. The Garden Hotel can be used as both a business tourism hotel and a resort hotel. Anyway, this time I took a vacation. There are food and entertainment here, and I can stay in the hotel all day without getting bored.
This is a historically famous five-star hotel with very high cost performance. A little bit more famous in Shanghai will be over a thousand, or even several thousand. The deluxe room here is about 800, and the hardware doesn't feel much different from those. I looked at the brand of bath liquid and those are also available, although I bring my own bath liquid, etc., and do not need a hotel. Breakfast will also be included when there is an event discount.

         After check-in at the hotel, various small service details also highlighted the background and level of this old five-star hotel in Shanghai. Lingering in the hotel's lush spring garden, enjoying a warm breakfast in the Red Rose üåπ Cafe, I feel happy physically and mentally, and this trip is worthwhile.

I also ordered a box of Internet celebrity biscuits at the lobby restaurant. Since I bought them to eat at home, I wanted to buy simple packaging. The staff at the restaurant said: I will not make simple packaging, only gift boxes, saying simple packaging. Off the shelf, do not do it.

2. Some waiters are very enthusiastic when watching people ordering food, especially Japanese customers. They smile and can bend down and bow 90¬∞. But when they turn around and see Chinese customers, their faces immediately change. They are extremely indifferent. If you don‚Äôt believe it, you can experience it for yourself.
3. The afternoon tea was a mess, the pastries were not fresh, and the fruits should be frozen leftovers from the morning. The key point was that when we made a reservation for afternoon tea the day before, a waitress turned her back on us and ignored us when she saw us. This was such a poor service. .
4. There is no freshly squeezed juice for breakfast, only synthetic juice.

Probably because I arrived at the store too late, and the phone call after 1 o'clock disturbed her to rest. In addition, the breakfast is hard to describe. After paying attention, the hotel specially puts sashimi/sushi on the boat, but after the guests finish picking it up, I will not go on it again within 40 minutes of my attention.

However, the check-in speed at the front desk is extremely slow. There are only two people providing services during peak hours. Check-in, check-out, and add room cards. The average waiting time for things is 15 minutes. The room decoration is also relatively old. I had a high fever on the first night because the weather was not suitable for me. I wanted to add another quilt and was told that it was out of rent. When I checked out, I was informed that I had consumed a bottle of juice in the minibar. But the fee was still not deducted. I called twice in the evening to inform them of the additional charge. Breakfast was outsourced to the connected Rose restaurant. It cost 140/person, which can be described as unpalatable. There were few dishes, the food was not delicious, and the noodles were not cooked. The attitude of the wonton chef was very bad. (But I found that the hotel has a very good attitude towards foreigners. Do they treat them differently?) Before leaving, my friend came to pick me up and wanted to use the room card to waive the parking fee. He told me that the time on the room card was wrong and asked me to go back.

The parking lot is still free, which is rare in a prime location. This is also an important reason for repeatedly choosing the Garden Hotel. The only shortcoming: the mattress is too soft, which is not very friendly to patients with back diseases. In any case, this is my best choice for business trips and tourism in Shanghai.

üëçThe location is great, it is very comfortable to walk in front of the hotel, and I went to the Blackstone Apar**ent for a walk.
üëçThe hotel room is on the 22nd floor, with a great view.
üëçThe afternoon tea in the Rose Restaurant is very good. The breakfast is also here. The waiter in black was a bit cold at breakfast time.
üëâThe hotel's epidemic prevention requirements are inconsistent. In other hotels you have stayed in, you only need to use the room card to check in and out, and you don‚Äôt need to scan the code repeatedly, but this hotel must scan the code again and again, even if you hold the room card. Then in the evening, a waiter changed at the door, and said that there is no room card. I feel like I don't communicate well internally.
üòíThe overall hygiene is average, after all, the hotel looks a bit old.
üòíThe environment is actually pretty good, but because of the Mid-Autumn Festival, there are always people holding weddings in the garden. It's messy, so it's also very damaging to the environment.
üòí Internet celebrity biscuits are really not my dish, they are greasy and sweet, and I can't eat one piece.
üòäThe overall cost performance is okay, you can stay for one night to experience it.

msg:It's very average. If it's too conservative, it's very Japanese. Then the hardware facilities, everything cannot keep up with the times!
The only three satisfying points:
1. The check-in service at the front desk was good, and I was particularly impressed by Mr. Zhang Zhen and Ms. Li Huafeng.
2.The room is big enough
3.The garden is big enough
Points of dissatisfaction:
1. Too rigid and not very flexible
2. The facilities are too old
3. The curtain in the bathroom is a bit dirty, and there are hair stuck to it.
4. The bedding is shabby
5. Takeout is not allowed. This is really quite offensive. The Peninsula Hotel, a benchmark five-star hotel, has its own relevant controls. For example, there is a takeout cabinet in the concierge. This is so inhumane and extremely undesirable! In short, this is my second time staying at Hotel Okura. The first time was in Macau. The two are so different that I have a bad impression. I basically won‚Äôt stay there a second time. I‚Äôd rather stay at a hotel owned by Huazhu such as Jiji. At least the service can cater to current consumers.

When I left the hotel on November 8th, I forgot to pick up a newly bought large bath towel, and one towel (2 yellow ones) was left in room 1031. I called the front desk and the answer was blunt. We checked and found that it was not in the room. I took a car in front of the lobby of your hotel and went directly to the International Hotel. I got off the car and went directly to the front desk to register and then went to the room. Could it be that the two items were missing? fly. Afterwards, you can only admit that you are unlucky.

Although the hotel facilities are outdated, the software is still distinctive. It shows the strict etiquette of Japanese management. The price is very affordable, more than 800 including breakfast, I don't know if this price will be available in the future. Will definitely come again if the price can be maintained.

msg:Beauty is late, but also can age gracefully. This hotel should have a history of 30 years. It is located in the core area of the old concession. Its predecessor was the French Club. In the early 1990s, a high-rise building was built behind it. The two are combined into one. Today's Garden Hotel. The hotel is managed in Japanese style, and the interior decoration and service level also have Japanese style. It's just that it's been too long, and some facilities are inevitably old. Coupled with the current epidemic, the hotel is like a dusty old antique, toned but helpless. The room size is not small, the view is also very good, but the facilities are old. The TV is too small and lacks a USB port. The variety of breakfast restaurants has little impact on the epidemic, and the service can't keep up. The fitness club is only open to the guests of the deluxe room free of charge, and must be reserved in advance. The rest of the guests have to pay fifty yuan at a time. The swimming pool has only three lanes, and only three people are allowed to use it at a time during the epidemic, which is magical enough. The green space directly opposite the hotel is also somewhat decayed. Parking is free for in-house guests. The hotel is close to Huaihai Road, so it is very convenient to eat and shop. The service staff are generally older, and the overall service quality is ok. During the epidemic, there are still very few guests staying in the hotel, but there are still many guests who come to the banquet hall for banquets and weddings. As the first batch of luxury hotels in Shanghai after the reform and opening up, after all, it has inherited the memory of the older generation of Shanghainese.

This year, I came to the store again to find out, and found that the situation has improved a lot. The service staff are very enthusiastic, so I immediately checked in at the counter. The advantage of the store is that it is located in a prime location in Shanghai, with a good view from the window, automatic flushing toilets, and the podium is a famous old building with a lot of historical and cultural heritage. The downside is that compared with hotels of the same star, the size of the rooms is a bit smaller and the price is a bit expensive.

msg:The epidemic is welcoming the new year in situ. In 2022, I decided to stay in the long-awaited Garden Hotel.

üçÉEnvironment: You can feel full of Japanese style when you enter the hotel. The reception staff, the overall environment of the hotel, the color of the decoration, the sound of the elevator, etc., are all very Japanese.
üîîService: The reception in the lobby and the front desk were very friendly. For the 2-night room, I placed 2 orders on Ctrip. I took the initiative to inform when I checked in. As a result, the room card was only played for 1 night, and the impression began to be discounted. Because of the epidemic situation, personal information needs to be registered. After filling in, the front desk will put the paper aside. When we finished check-in and were ready to leave, the papers were still at the front desk. I don‚Äôt know if the next guest has our personal information before going through. Will not be put away.
üßπSanitation: I stayed in a room with a city view on the 20th floor, and the high-rise buildings on Huaihai Road can be seen outside the window. Although the facilities in the room are a bit old, the overall color makes people feel very warm. There is a wall between the bathroom and the bedroom. Unlike many hotels in China, it is glass. Turning on the light in the bathroom at night will wake others up. In addition, the toilet is equipped with a washlet, but the communal washlet is a bit contradictory. The toilet is old-fashioned and splashes when you use the toilet (Ôø£^Ôø£)
Because we were staying in the New Year, there was an organized countdown party in the hotel that night. We did not attend. The next day we went out and saw a lot of sequined paper on the carpet in the corridor. You can imagine the grand party the night before. When we returned to the room, the cleaning was finished, and as a result, there were a few more pieces of sequined paper in the corridor in our room...
The overall impression of Okura is a Japanese-style high-end hotel. The feeling of staying this time has not reached the level of a high-end hotel, and may not be as good as other domestic hotels. emmm‚Ä¶‚Ä¶above

Finally, I checked into the Garden Hotel, the former French general meeting. The momentum is indeed different. Take a look at Shanghai on the highest 34th floor. Although it is no longer the old Luwan in "Flowers", it is also the beginning of the dream of a generation of Shanghainese.
Japanese-style room, whether it is service details or room facilities, you have to choose!

The facilities in the room are old-fashioned, but they are kept in good condition with few breakages. They are cleaned and feel very comfortable. The old-style furniture and decoration have become a nostalgic style. There are many small restaurants in the surrounding area, especially Japanese food shops and izakayas, which are very authentic.

msg:This is the first bad review in many years, I suggest you read it carefully before checking in.

First of all, the hotel room facilities are extremely poor, and regardless of almost every room type, there is a huge mirror directly facing the bed, which makes people uncomfortable. Let me talk about the first point, the real problem I feel.
I stayed here for about a week. I originally booked a twin bed, but because the bathtub was so dirty (many yellow dirt on the edge that was difficult to clean), the next day, I changed to a deluxe double bed room. Unbelievable, there was no charging socket by the bed, so I had to look for the socket for the bedside lamp. As a result, we can see that as shown in the picture, the plug of one bedside lamp is seriously disconnected, posing a safety hazard; the induction of the other bedside lamp is seriously malfunctioning, which is suspected to be caused by aging wires.
The safety and sanitation problems caused by the overall aging are simply disgusting.

The second question related to the hotel fee is the second reason why I do not recommend everyone to go to the hotel.
On my first day at this hotel, my wife was told that she was not allowed to order take away and had to eat at the hotel. When I checked in after work, I repeatedly confirmed this problem, and the front desk staff changed their words and said "not allowed", but "not recommended"; second, it is also the most ridiculous point in my opinion: as a staying guest, I went to the hotel gym, and I was charged 50 yuan for admission, which is unheard of; The specifications of the breakfast I witnessed, I don't think that ordinary food such as a few breads/eggs, in such a hotel, has any reason to be worthy of 220 yuan/person.
Third, the problem of hotel services.
I must admit that after I reported these problems to the hotel, the person in charge of the front desk apologized for these problems very quickly, and I am very grateful to this lady. But aside from this matter, from the first second I got off the car to the hotel, there was no doorman to pick up the luggage on my behalf, to the other front desk who couldn‚Äôt communicate normally on the room rate (I don‚Äôt blame this person here, it may also be a problem with my unclear communication), the overall hotel service, as a five-star hotel, I don‚Äôt think it is qualified.

To sum up, the overall hardware condition of the hotel can be said to be extremely poor. If it is not necessary for work, I very much hope to move out of this hotel on the first day of my stay.
Here, I feel like living in a youth hostel.
I sincerely advise all viewers, after seeing this, I suggest you choose other hotels, even if it is an express hotel, it will not allow so many problems to appear at the same time.
And it's a big joke that this actually exists in parallel in such an old five-star hotel in Shanghai.

1. Connect the wires in the room at will
2. There is only one bathtub and shower. Those who like to get wet can only stand in the bathtub and use a small shower to take a shower.
3. The room facilities are outdated, like back to the beginning of the reform and opening up
4. The room does not need electricity, the air conditioner is always on. Entering the room is like entering an ice cellar, and you will catch a cold directly (the air conditioner is turned off and still cold), and the aisle is also terribly cold.
5. There is no place to store the takeaway, so just throw it on the flowerbed.
6. The toothbrush is so hard that it bleeds directly from brushing
7. Slippers in star-rated hotels are like small hotels, thin as paper
8. Towels are from 2019 and have been used for several years
9. The kettle is a Supor, it is estimated that 59 will be used up to now
10. A bottle of mineral water sells for 50 yuan, and I am embarrassed to bid on the list
11. No one will take care of check-out at the front desk, so leave the room card
12. The bathtub is separated by a curtain, and there is a reminder not to put the water on the ground. Isn't this requirement a joke?
13. When I checked in, I said that the parking card is the room card set. You can take it out. Who knows that when I went out, I was called by the security guard to register the license plate. I remember that I wrote it at the front desk when I checked in. This service is really no second. NS

msg:The service in this Japanese hotel is so poor, it‚Äôs really not Japanese at all! First let me talk about the hotel facilities. It has nothing to do with five stars. It is at the level of three stars. The room furnishings are old and the slippers are also three stars. Let me talk about the shower. It is really difficult to use. Normally, when the button is pressed, water will flow out from below. When I stood up, the shower head was leaking water, but it fell down when I lifted it up. I called the guest room, and was told that there was only one person in the hotel who knew how to use it, and that was the only staff member in the housekeeping depar**ent. None of them knew how to use it... and then they said The housekeeping staff went to collect the garbage, not necessarily on which floor. They said they would call me back later. I waited for more than 20 minutes and ignored me. I had to call again and then asked me to wait again. I didn‚Äôt know after waiting. I have been doing various research for a long time, and it turns out that when the button is lifted up, the water needs to be released at the same time to send water to the shower. The button does not need to be loosened. This setting is really speechless! Let‚Äôs talk about the service. I ordered takeout and someone called me suddenly. I was anxious to go downstairs to put on a bathrobe. Then the hotel staff stopped me and said I couldn‚Äôt come out wearing a bathrobe. I said my takeout had arrived. I If you can't go out, please help me get it. Your hotel doesn't have a takeout counter. The takeaway guy is in a hurry to deliver the order and has no place to put it. As a result, the hotel staff neither helps me get it (it's just a few steps away) or... When I was asked to go out, I had to go upstairs to change my clothes and then come down. Even though I was tightly wrapped in a bathrobe, I didn‚Äôt reveal anything! How inappropriate! In many five-star hotels, you can wear a bathrobe and go to the first floor for breakfast in the morning! How could a three-star hotel with a five-star reputation be so demanding of me? The delivery boy called me anxiously. I didn‚Äôt want to go back to the 25th floor to change clothes so I walked over to get the takeout. They even stopped me and said I couldn‚Äôt get it like this, which made me mad! In short, the facilities are poor and the service is terrible! Will never stay here again!

The interior is very similar to the hotel I stayed in Japan, especially the bathroom attached to the gym comes with a sauna and hot spring, which is exactly the same as the hot spring hotel I stayed in Japan.
It is recommended for those who like Japanese-style hotels, have a nostalgic sense of history, and pursue cost-effectiveness and location. Not suitable for picky people who only love the so-called new high-tech high-end crowd.

When I checked in on the first day, I already agreed to move my luggage to the new hotel the next day. The room, I went directly to get the new room card. When I went to the front desk the next day, there were many people, so I went to a counter that didn‚Äôt do check in (that‚Äôs the Japanese) and said I wanted to ask where I should go to get the card. He listened I didn‚Äôt even listen to it and just said queuing up. I said I was just consulting, and he kept queuing up repeatedly. The voice was loud as if I was not in line. The voice was so loud that the little girl at the side window who didn‚Äôt do checkin could hear it. Yes, just waved the room card and told me to go and get it, no need to queue at all. As a five-star hotel, I was really stunned to have such a service. I didn‚Äôt even listen to the customer‚Äôs questions, and would only rudely interrupt and make a request that didn‚Äôt match the horse‚Äôs mouth. There was no respect at all. If you cannot speak the language and are unable to serve Chinese people, you can tell me or help me find someone else. If you don‚Äôt know how to serve customers, it is strongly recommended to re-study the assessment before taking up the job. It is a very unpleasant experience for Chinese New Year.

This is actually a five-star hotel in Shanghai, up to 4 stars
If this has always been the case, it is not called the Garden Hotel, but the **** Hotel.
There are a lot of people checking in, but checking out is faster. So I planned to shoot a video (I will not shoot other guests due to the situation). There is a waiter here, who came over and said loudly not to shoot, saying that I can't shoot the guests, I said I know this. And the waiter said loudly, saying that all the guests looked at me. I told him that your decibels were lower, but the result was still the same.
I have stayed in many star-rated hotels. This is the first time I have seen this kind of service. I don't respect customers, don't handle it properly, and I'm proud of it.
Room
The bathroom and the bathtub are too old, and the sanitation of the thread plug cannot be ignored. The toothbrush is as hard as a hotel, with bleeding gums.
The TV location in the room is average, just to the left.
Isolation is particularly poor, and the sound of vehicles or construction outside can still be heard while sleeping. I thought it was because the windows were not closed, and the result was poor sound insulation.

In the center of Shanghai, it is rare that the room is very large, 36 square meters of double bed is really good! The rooms are clean and the toilets are smaller, but the price and location are really good. The hotel service is also very good. I asked to change to a garden-view room. After looking up the room at the front desk, I changed it for me. The room attendant is also very good. There is a big gardenüå∏. It takes only five minutes to reach the Shaanxi South Station of Line 1. It takes five or six minutes to walk to Parkson. There is also ipam, and there is a lot of food. It's not far to Wukang Road. When we went there was a fireworks typhoon. It was raining heavily when we went out without an umbrella. The front desk carefully prepared big umbrellas of better quality. Although it is a bit old on the whole, the location is clean and tidy, and the cost is not high, and the price is very high. Like a historic hotel. Did not eat breakfast, eat a lot around. Suitable for bringing children, Shanghai mainly visits scenic spots, not hotels. There is parking lot.

The design of the entire hotel from the lobby to the restaurant to the guest rooms is the same as that of a traditional Japanese hotel. As soon as I entered the lobby, it reminded me of the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo, a reduced version. The only downside is that the room facilities are relatively outdated, there are no USB ports, and few power outlets. What I want to praise is the sound insulation of the windows.

2. After staying for several days, no waiter has ever called you Mr. or Ms. "Hello". Every day when I come back, I will be called "Hey, health code", breakfast will be called "Hey, swipe down the room card", and the door will be called "Hey, go further" even if it is an electronic cigarette.

msg:Ridiculous mother opened the door for Ridiculous. Ridiculous is home. All the hotel's money was used to decorate the garden and lobby. The house is too old, it reminds me of reform and opening up. There were handprints on the mirror when I just checked in. There was oil on the curtains. It is much better than any hotel in the same price range. The bed is so small and the bedding is damp. The lobby is of five-star standard, and the rooms cannot be more than three-star. Takeout must be taken downstairs immediately. Not only is there no place to put takeout, but there is a special sign outside saying that takeout cannot be placed on this table. I really can't understand why there are still rules for staying in a hotel. The greeters at the door will take care of you according to your mood. There were strange guests harassing me at the front desk in the middle of the night. Never come again and loudly tell everyone not to come.

msg:The experience of this stay was poor (1) The hotel equipment was old, the bathroom exhaust fan was faulty, and the toilet had a strange smell. I notified the hotel, but they did not come to repair it, but just deodorized it. (2) The air conditioner was still very strong when turned on the maximum. Hot (3) The smart toilet seat in the toilet is faulty and requires notification to fix it (4) Guests are not allowed to use the swimming pool for free, which is very stingy (5) During the stay, it is very inconvenient to have to tell the front service staff every time you drive out. ;Parking is difficult during meal times

msg:The gym is not free for all hotel guests, which is really disgusting.
Although the hotel is a bit old, I often book this hotel because of its excellent geographical location and its own parking lot. This time I used the gym and was annoyed. When I called the switchboard, I was not told in advance that the gym is charged and is only free for guests on the deluxe floor and above? ? ?
I was halfway through exercising and the aunt in the fitness area came over and told me that I was charged? ? ? It's like eating a fly.
I asked the front desk where the fee was spent, and towels were not offered and neither was water. Reply: The equipment in the gym is available for use, and the water is in the bathroom. I just laughed! !
I will not book this hotel again for a business trip! !

msg:The check-in experience was very bad. There is an additional fee for the gym. I went swimming and was discriminated against by a local Shanghainese girl based on my geographical location. It was really disgusting. So disgusting for such locals. There are many locals around. It is recommended that outsiders do not send money to them. Why don't we spend our money on other hotels. There should be some locals in the gym, they are very discriminatory towards outsiders. Living here is like paying for your happiness. Six or seven hundred dollars a night is not cheap, it's very old. I don't often write reviews. All in all very bad. I still have nigh**ares when I sleep at night... I'm so old. has a problem.

It‚Äôs understandable that you can‚Äôt enter the restaurant in slippers. Isn‚Äôt it okay to go downstairs to get a takeaway? I have never had this experience in other better five-star hotels.

There was a Jinjiang next door and I was crazy about it. As a result, it was full of customers. Maybe this one ran out. JAL is not so frantic in other places. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs Japan.

msg:Hotel spettacolare con posizione molto centrale e attaccato ad una stazione della metropolitana, L'hotel si trova immerso in un giardino rigoglioso e perfettamente mantenuto. Ha un rapporto qualit√† prezzo che difficilmente troverete a Shanghai. Appena sono entrato hanno trasportato la mia valigia ed hanno atteso che completassi il check-in per accompagnarmi fino in camera. ll personale augura sempre un buon soggiorno appena ti vedono che sei appena arrivato. Le aree comuni brillano per la loro pulizia. La camera, con vista sul giardino dell'hotel, √® ben curata in tutti i dettagli addirittura con un wc elettronico giapponese. Bottiglie di acqua sempre a disposizione. Sul letto troverete addirittura il menu dei cuscini per scegliere tra quattro tipi diversi di cuscino che la reception vi fornir√† immediatamente oltre alla vestaglia in stile giapponese. Potrete usufruire gratuitamente di una bellissima piscina al coperto (dovete portarvi una cuffia per coprire i capelli) e di una spa divisa per sessi con vasca di acqua calda alla giapponese (dovete farvi la doccia prima di entrare ma ovviamente ci sono anche i prodotti per l'igiene forniti), sauna e area relax con poltrone su cui sdraiarvi e bere te freddo offerto dall'hotel. Insomma, questo hotel non ha nulla da invidiare ad altre catene alberghiere blasonate ovviamente molto pi√π costose. Tutto assolutamente impeccabile soprattutto se rapportato al prezzo molto competitivo.

msg:The service of the hotel is very good. Because of the itinerary problem, we checked out and booked again the next day. Ms. Liu at the front desk also gave us an upgrade service to let the children rest better. The surrounding area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel is very prosperous, and you can get food, accommodation and transportation in one stop. In a place where every inch of land is expensive in Shanghai, such a large hotel also has an independent garden, and the environment is very comfortable. The room was quiet and the family was well rested. In the future, I will choose the Garden Hotel again when I go to Shanghai.

I was afraid that it would be inconvenient to carry luggage at 11 o‚Äôclock. Ms. Le at the front desk helped me with late check-out. The car can be parked until 3 o‚Äôclock. I happily ate an old Shanghai western food at Swan Pavilion, and then walked slowly along Jinxian Road and Changle Road. The time when I was a child seems to have come again

The environment is very good, the price is more affordable than the surrounding hotels, and the service is very good. Xiaoyun at the front desk helped us upgrade the room type, and the view is amazing! Next time I go to Shanghai, I will go to Huayuanjia to leave a good impression!
