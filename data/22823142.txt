msg:Okay, but much better options exist if you have the money and book in advance.

First of all, its a separate class of hotel situated within the very same Marriot (which is higher end), so consider this a class below the actual Marriot. The exit is separate, and leads mostly to nowhere, and you will most likely enter the real Marriot part of the building at first, but thankfully staff knows this is a common mistake and leads you through a small hallway of about 200m to the other reception where you will be greeted by just as professional staff.

They don't include any toiletries but will deliver them swiftly to the room door if you need any, I guess its ecological, in their mind, but practically..ultimately pointless and saves no one's time and energy.

The room itself is a bit of a step down from regular 4* chain hotels - the size, the leather on the furniture is torn and worn a bit, and it shows its age and class. There are similarly priced competitors within the same 1-2km range, who do a much better job, plus better view, for a few bucks more. It should be priced a bit lower in order to be a good deal and vibe for the money. Ultimately an okay hotel, no one will be disappointed, but the value to me just isn't there, and the real Marriot is in the same building, but you are getting the cheaper version of it, watered down.

msg:It was my first time staying at Courtyard by Marriott. I felt really good. When I booked the room, I felt the gentleness and patience of the hotel staff. The front desk guy was super nice. Maybe because it was off-season, I upgraded the room for free. The actual room was consistent with the promotional pictures. It was not a lie at all. The room faced the sea, which was beautiful and comfortable. In the middle, because of the rider's mistake, I mistakenly thought that the milk tea was lost. After the hotel staff knew about it, they patiently helped me get the milk tea back that was sent to the wrong place. The service attitude and problem-solving ability of the Courtyard staff are really great. Great reviews!!!

The standard room is standard and there is nothing to say about the Courtyard room. I was upgraded to a sea view room when I checked in. Unfortunately, the weather was not good and it was so foggy that Gulangyu Island could not be seen. It was a pity.

msg:The guy at the front desk upgraded the room type and said the view was very good, as shown below. But the service awareness can really be improved. When booking the room, I made a note that I didn‚Äôt need the first and last rooms, so I gave the last room. Finally, the staff (looked like the manager) came up and changed the room, and also said that he would change the room after leaving the note. Arranging head and tail rooms and cleaning the guest rooms are very good. But the follow-up greeters and service center can do better. They will not open the door automatically when entering, but only when exiting the lobby... In other words, although it is not Marriott, Courtyard is also based on the 5-star standard. Well, service does still require training sessions. And this curtain leaks light...it wakes me up directly in the morning...

The hotel room had a bit of a musty smell, but luckily there were windows for ventilation. The parking lot in the hotel basement is also very poor. It's all dust. The only thing is that going to Gulangyu Island is relatively close to Songgu Pier. There are fewer people there. There are almost no supporting facilities around the hotel. But fortunately, the scenery outside the hotel window is okay. If it is a room facing the sea. Overall not recommended! !

msg:When I booked the hotel, I read past reviews that there were no free upgrades to sea view rooms and complimentary breakfast for members. The hotel is newly renovated, so it is quite clean in terms of hygiene. However, one drawback is that the decoration smell is very strong, and the windows in the room are locked, so you have to ask someone to help open them. In addition, it may be a new hotel, and the guests may not be able to open it. There are not many cars in the parking lot, so the air conditioning is not turned on to save money. The whole room is very stuffy and does not feel breathable at all. It is 20 degrees outside and at 11 noon, the room is already extremely hot. With the decoration The smell makes everyone feel uncomfortable.

msg:The hotel and Marriott are considered an annex building, and breakfast and swimming pools are shared with Marriott. Opposite is Haicang Park, about ten minutes away from the subway station. The hotel's breakfast variety is very rich, with Xiamen's local breakfast. There is also a pier nearby to go to Gulangyu Island.

The biggest highlight is Marriott's outdoor swimming pool, where a plane flies overhead in about five minutes, and the night view is also very charming. Family travel is very cost-effective.

I have a small suggestion, I hope that the bathroom in the room can add a basket for used towels, otherwise I don‚Äôt know where to put the dirty towels that need to be replaced.

msg:The waiter swiped my card to enter my room without my permission during non-cleaning hours (after nine o'clock in the evening). When I came back and found out, I asked the waiter to go out immediately. The waiter was stunned for a long time before going out! After I reported the situation in detail to the front desk, the front desk said they would contact me after investigating. Half an hour had passed since I called again. After the call, the employee who claimed to be the manager asked me to state the development of the incident again. I don't understand why I was interrogated twice. Didn't your subordinate report the investigation results to you? Secondly, after I explained that I was not in the room and turned on Do Not Disturb, the manager said that it was entirely our responsibility! This sentence is really thought-provoking. Can the waiter enter privately when it is not cleaning time and no one answers the door? ? ? ? Then you can come in and watch me while I'm taking a shower? The last solution the manager gave me was to make up for my breakfast. I really thought it was so funny. It is a clear shirking of responsibility. Breakfast is still a buffet. It is equivalent to blocking my mouth with a solution that cannot be called responsible at all. I feel like my privacy has been violated and I don't get any respect! Secondly, the security guard at the door is often not at his post, and the door is so heavy that my fingernails are torn off.

msg:If you book a stay at the end of the Spring Festival, it costs 600 per night, which is not expensive among hotels in Xiamen. The experience is average:
1. The closed windows of the hotel rooms cannot be opened at all, even opening a crack, so the room is relatively stuffy, and the air conditioner cannot be turned on to cool the air, so the room is as hot as a greenhouse during the day~
2. It is useless to have a sea view room without a balcony or to open some windows to feel the sound of the sea breeze and waves.
3. Courtyard should not list 5 diamonds on Ctrip, and the hardware facilities are at most 4 diamonds, which is far from 5 diamonds or 5 stars.
4. Only one of the hotel's two elevators can reach the -2 underground parking lot, so every time you want to go to the parking lot, press the elevator to try your luck. If the elevator does not come, you have to change to another one.
5. The cafeteria is shared with Marriott, the dinner is 169, and the quality is very average.

Staff will greet you when you enter and leave the hotel, and it feels like the service at Courtyard is even better than Marriott.

What needs to be improved is that there is room for improvement in the public area. When I went to the elevator in the guest room, I saw that the tissue waste in the elevator was still there at 8:00 the next morning. I also went to the toilet in the Marriott lobby next door. Everything was fine. The trash can in the bathroom was very rusted. It didn‚Äôt match the level of Marriott.

üîîService: Very good, the lady at the front desk is very enthusiastic
There is a lifeguard in the swimming pool, always guarding
üçÉEnvironment: Next to the Marriott Hotel, it seems to be a hotel with a good location, but it is a bit difficult to find

[Seaside scenery] Not far from the hotel is the beach, you can go to play

msg:The hotel is by the sea, and it shares facilities with Marriott. The price of this Courtyard is comparable to Marriott, and it is not clear what the pricing standard is. The service attitude is good, maintaining the consistent five-star level, the facilities are also good, and the water quality of the indoor and outdoor swimming pools is acceptable. The room was clean and tidy, and the bed was very comfortable. It's good to live on a business trip.
