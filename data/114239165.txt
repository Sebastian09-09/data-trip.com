msg:Amazing cultural stay among the historical site of Suzhou! Changyuan 畅圆 is really beautiful and nothing beats experiencing Suzhou than staying within one of the rare classical gardens (园林). Booked the Deluxe Room and loved the privacy and garden view. Absolutely loved the amenities too — from TOTO bathroom fittings to Dyson hairdryer, everything exceeded expectations. Only downside is that it’s pretty far from attractions and it’s quite a walk to the main road. Will be great if you’re looking to stay away from the ccrowd and prefers a more peaceful and quiet location. The staff are warm, friendly and very helpful too, thanks so much 小姚 and 小马!

Service: The service is the biggest highlight. Our housekeepers Xiao Luo and Xiao Xue are very warm and thoughtful. Any items we need or takeaways are delivered to the room very quickly.

A small and exquisite garden hotel with a reasonable distribution. I didn't even meet other residents in the three days I stayed in a suite in an independent building (although the ten rooms were full every day).
The scenery is pleasant and the food is also very good, which can be delivered to the bedroom. It is quiet in the city center, with convenient transportation and various delicious foods nearby.
Put on Hanfu and Republic of China costumes to take pictures. It feels like a private garden.
The hotel does not have a TV. It focuses on a slow life. Put down electronic products and enjoy the nature with birds and flowers. A very good three-day experience.

I booked the hotel early, and the hotel concierges Xiao Xue and Xiao Luo were very responsible and enthusiastic. When they saw the order, they called me to understand our situation. Because we were three girls traveling and involved the issue of extra beds, they helped us actively coordinate and solve the problem! Thank them very much! Fireworks in March in the south of the Yangtze River, you can imagine how many people there are in Suzhou, but you can enjoy a garden landscape when you enter the hotel! It's really perfect. Don't look at the small garden, but there is a view at every step! Very exquisite! We took pictures in the garden for a whole morning, and I was reluctant to leave~ The hotel itself is a historical building and cultural relic protection! I really recommend it! The breakfast is also very exquisite and there are two types of Chinese and Western styles to choose from. The Aozao noodles are very authentic! The location is also very central, and it is very convenient to go anywhere. I will choose here next time I come to Suzhou.

msg:Changyuan is very small. You can walk through it in 5 minutes. You can see the whole garden at a glance. There are mountains and water. The small garden of the Qing Dynasty is not in a weird new Chinese style. The green plant pool is generally maintained, the sanitation is sloppy, and the glass of the tea room is old and gray. I didn't buy a room voucher and booked an expensive one. It's more expensive than my Suzhou Four Seasons room voucher. The room is spacious and regular, it should be 60 square meters and it feels like a private courtyard. I don't like the indoor sofa without a chaise longue. The most disastrous thing is that I went back to the room to make the night bed and lit the aromatherapy candle. I was crazy. I couldn't stand the smell at all. There was no window screen when I opened the window for ventilation. The air conditioner was broken. The only thing I used was Xiaomi air purification. Which professional hotel has aromatherapy in the room! The public space is OK, but the room needs to stay in for a long time to sleep! The towels are not washed fresh but smell like disinfectant. The restaurant and bar are not clean, and all the black cups are of poor quality. The old house should strengthen the ventilation facilities instead of lighting aromatherapy. The breakfast is terrible and the quality is very poor, the level of a 300 yuan B&B. Overall, the reception and room service were very good, but the food was substandard and the air conditioner in the room was broken. I will never stay at the Youxiong brand again. The only good thing is that the bathroom is a full set of Toto.

The housekeepers Xiao Yao and Xiao Ma were very enthusiastic and called us one day in advance to ask what we needed for staying in the hotel. After checking in, they also introduced the hotel environment in detail.
Changyuan is a national 4A garden cultural attraction and is open to the public twice a month! There happened to be a team visiting on the day of check-in. The whole garden is a perfect combination of Suzhou traditional garden architecture and modern aesthetic design, with pavilions, bridges and flowing water, one window and one shadow, full of Jiangnan charm, and also personally felt the unique charm of Jiangnan culture. Read books and listen to music in Tonghua Book House with flower windows on all sides, taste tea in Liuyun Mountain House, drink afternoon tea in pavilions and towers by the pool, and enjoy the beautiful garden scenery outside the window, comfortable and cozy.
The breakfast is rich, with Chinese and Western set meals, and is enjoyed in a houseboat moored by the pool. The food and scenery are really "paradise on earth"!

msg:Environment: The elegant and quiet garden landscape is superb! Changyuan is small and exquisite, and the key is that there are only 10 rooms as a whole, so you can enjoy the whole garden privately in peace and quiet. It is also super nice to drink afternoon tea in the pavilion, and with a little rain, it is full of Jiangnan feeling.

Service: The hotel adopts butler service. This time the butler is Xiao Luo, and I must give him a thumbs up! The service is very enthusiastic, and it can be said that it is responsive. The hotel is in a long and narrow box. The hotel will send a sightseeing car to pick up and help take the luggage to the room. These are standard. It happened to be a birthday check-in, and the hotel also helped to prepare a birthday cake 🎂, which is very good. This time, the hotel also helped you upgrade the room type, and the experience is full. Originally, I thought that I must wear Hanfu to take pictures of the ancient town and garden scenery when I came to Suzhou. After making up, I found that Pingjiang Road, Qili Shantang, Humble Administrator's Garden, and Lingering Garden... were all overcrowded... Suzhou carries too many tourists and can't take pictures at all. I immediately returned to Changyuan to take pictures. Hahaha, the garden background is all mine, and I don’t have to eliminate passers-by with one click!

Facilities and sanitation: The facilities are complete and the sanitation is also very clean. The room has a large bathtub for a comfortable bath, a separate Japanese-style tea room, and a garden view outside the window of the tea room. It is very comfortable to drink tea. It is equipped with a relatively large refrigerator bar and a coffee machine. Breakfast can be eaten in the dock restaurant or delivered to the room. The whole experience is very comfortable and I don’t want to leave the room at all. It will still be my first choice when I come to Suzhou Changyuan next time!

Walking in the alleys paved with blue bricks, gray tiles and white walls, and surrounded by dark water, wherever you stop, you will see flying flowers as clear as dreams and drizzling rain as fine as sorrow. Sitting on a stone bench by the road, watching the fragrance of gardenias on Pingjiang Road, listening to the laughter under the tung oil umbrella, it seems that time has slowed down. It’s a pity that when traveling on holidays, there are crowds everywhere, and the seven-mile Shantang is blocked for six miles, and the Lion Forest has become a lion head. Fortunately, I live in Changyuan, so I can see the flowing water painting without going out. Although the courtyard is not big, the fist-shaped stones are gathered into a mountain, the water is surrounded by a pool, and the drizzle knocks on the window. Taking a rest on the recliner and drinking a pot of fragrant tea is the real Jiangnan.

The guest room was renovated from a private house next to Changyuan Garden. The design is simple and practical, and there is a courtyard landscaped outside the floor-to-ceiling window. The floor heating in the room is very good, giving guests warmth in the cold winter. The toiletries are from Bvlgari, which is of high quality.
The service was enthusiastic and in place. Due to special circumstances, we needed to shorten our trip by one night. After negotiating with the hotel, we readily agreed and refunded the hotel smoothly. A big thumbs up!
The only regret is that Changyuan is a cultural relic building and cannot be renovated. The book bar and tea room in the public area are a bit cold in the cold winter.

The self-service area only had large bags of bread and yogurt purchased from the supermarket.

msg:The hotel is located in a box, giving it the feeling of being hidden in the city. The door is very low-key and can be easily missed even if you don't pay attention. As a representative of Suzhou's small gardens, Changyuan is really small but has all the internal organs, small bridges, flowing water, pavilions and pavilions, condensed into one area of ​​the world, it is worth visiting.
In the nearly one-acre garden area, the hotel only has 10 rooms, so the room area is sufficient.
The basic room and superior king bed room we stayed in this time were 45 square meters with a three-way partition. The zoning was very reasonable. The bedroom faced a large floor-to-ceiling window and had an unobstructed view of the garden. When I got up in the morning, I was woken up by the birds in the yard. ,Very comfortable.
I would like to thank the two housekeepers Xiao Luo and Xiao Xue for their considerate assistance during this stay. They introduced the garden knowledge and the history of Changyuan very seriously, which made this trip very comfortable.

There is everything in the room, there are a lot of snacks and drinks. At night, the aunt comes to bring sugar water and aromatherapy to turn down the bed, which is so considerate. The oversized bathroom, bathtub with a view, and care products are also from Bvlgari... Anyway, the experience is very good, and I love that there is no TV. If you come to Suzhou, you must stay here to make sure your visit is not in vain! Those who live here don’t want to leave. What needs improvement is that the mobile phone signal in some rooms is a bit poor.

Basically, all requests are answered instantly. Before I went there, I read online reviews saying that the soundproofing was not good, and I was a little worried.

It is a brand of Vanke Group. The hotel was rebuilt on the basis of the garden architecture of the Qing Dynasty. It is only a few hundred meters away from Yangyang Station on Line 1 of Suzhou Metro Station and has a unique geographical location. When you enter the hotel lobby, you are attracted by the ancient garden architectural style. The hotel butlers Xiao Xue, Xiao Liu and Xiao Yao provide upgraded services, which makes me, a customer from afar, feel at home. The hotel has green bricks and white tiles, small bridges and flowing water, and each step allows guests to enjoy Suzhou's garden scenery without leaving home. Staying in the Youxiong Superior Suite, sipping the delicious afternoon tea, and looking at the small but cleverly laid out beauty of the garden, it feels like you are enjoying ancient poetry and painting. The hotel's breakfast adopts Chinese and Western catering, with many delicious varieties. The hotel's comprehensive service management has a high level and is worthy of being a luxury hotel in Suzhou. Next time I go to Suzhou for business travel, your hotel will be my first choice!

msg:I took my parents to stay at Changyuan Youxiong Hotel during the New Year's Day holiday. The housekeeper called the day before check-in to ask if parking was needed. He could contact us at any time if he needed to meet him when he arrived nearby, etc., which was very considerate. After checking in, the housekeeper took us to visit Chang Garden, introducing the bookstores, restaurants and other facilities in the garden, as well as the long history and culture of the garden. This time I stayed in a deluxe suite on the first floor. The original building had a three-bay layout facing north and south, with an open room and a conservatory in the east and west. The hotel was renovated into a room that opens from the side of the west conservatory, and then leads to the entrance hall and cloakroom in the west. The warm pavilion, the bright room of the small living room, and the east warm pavilion used as the bedroom. The original doors and windows were all opened and closed, allowing privacy during check-in even on the first floor. The room faces a unique small garden. Sitting in the room drinking tea and looking at the garden outside the window is very comfortable and relaxing. Both the furniture, appliances and ornaments in the room are very well designed. It can be seen that the hotel design is very thoughtful to allow guests to feel at home and enjoy the peaceful garden time. Every day the housekeeper will ask via WeChat if he is satisfied and if there is any need. He is very considerate and will not be intrusive. All requests are responded to quickly. In the evening, a waiter will come to deliver hot sweet soup, and there will also be a "turn-down" service - laying out the floor towel, placing a bear, and lighting aromatherapy. Get up in the morning, put on your clothes, walk through the hall and have breakfast at the waterside pavilion by the pool, then stroll around the yard, walk through the corridors, go to the study room to listen to music and read books, and listen to the sound of gurgling water by the pool. At the door of Yunshan House, people were lying around basking in the sun. . . This lazy and peaceful experience away from the hustle and bustle of the city has a healing power that rejuvenates me and allows me to experience the different scenery in ordinary life. I’m so glad I chose Youxiong to take my parents on vacation! (Ah, I forgot to buy scented candles when I checked out😂

A rose is given to you when you check in. The butler will take you into your room and explain to you all the details of Changyuan.
Changyuan is small and beautiful, and it was the first time I admired the garden at night. The dim lights gave it a unique charm. In the evening, they will also serve a sweet soup and help light up the aromatherapy. Of course, if there is a bear hotel, they will definitely give you a bear. Toiletries include toiletry bags, shower gel from Bvlgari, Dyson hair dryer and Toto toiletries, and tea bags from TWG. The soundproofing is a bit poor. When you ring the doorbell next door or upstairs, you think you are ringing your own room. However, there is nothing you can do in the protected building. The room was full on the day you checked in. The guests were all very good. I slept well at night. The breakfast set is made of Chinese or Western style. The Chinese style is relatively rich in content. The braised pork noodles are delicious. If it is not enough, you can add more. Overall I am very satisfied, especially the butlers Ronaldinho and Xiaoma, who are warm and considerate.

The restaurant is by the water and is a la carte service. At the same time, I live in Jingwenli and Changyuan. It can be said that both have their own advantages and disadvantages! Changyuan is quieter and more suitable for resting, and the breakfast is better than the one in Jingwenli.

2，蚊子多到你超乎想象，我媽一晚上在酒店吃飯被咬了20塊
3，酒店服務感覺雖然很熱情，但能力有限。比如餐廳就餐，一家人在吃飯頻繁插嘴……人家來吃飯你偶爾站旁邊説兩句挺正常，一直參與進來就讓人有點……

以上酒店可以改進，特別是蚊子……沒見過高端酒店有那麼多蚊子 反正一晚上吃飯能打死10隻的程度

寒風料峭的冬日，敲開有熊的大門，樸素的小巷裡藏着別有洞天的驚喜，聽着管家對酒店的介紹，感受周到細緻的服務，來到提前準備好的温暖房間。脱去厚重外套，泡杯清茶，坐在看得見風景的落地窗旁，閑看黃昏日落，光影變遷，感受園林之美，是蘇州行最愜意的打開方式。
突發狀況的行程調整也都很好地溝通解決了，期待下一次的有熊之行～

msg:來之前就知道有熊會是我喜歡的酒店，來之後感覺比預料的更好！
酒店真一個“鬧中取靜”，在城區中心地段的一條巷子裏，後來聽管家介紹才知道“暢園”是蘇州排名19的園林，4A級景區，真真“住進風景裏”。
辦理入住時，管家説給升級到了庭院房，有單獨的一個天井，私密性更好。房間夠大，內部佈置很簡約淡雅，用品都很有品味。經管家提醒才發覺房間裏是沒有電視的，説是為了讓住客更多的享受陪伴家人的時光，倒是正合我意。
放下行李，請管家帶領逛了一下，園子不大，但就像典型的蘇州園林一樣，小而精、小而美，亭台樓閣，流水花窗，移步換景。因為整間酒店衹有10間房，客人有限，所以在園子裏常有種獨享美景的感覺。園子裏還設了書屋，有很多書，晚上無事過來翻翻書也很是愜意。
臨走管家還送了娃玩具、巧克力。真是謝謝管家小馬、小薛兩天的照顧！下次還想住敬文裏有熊！
如果要説美中不足，就是酒店沒有給小孩準備的拖鞋、備品，我看下來帶小朋友來住的客人也不少，穿着成人拖鞋在屋裡走確實有點危險，還是希望以後能備上小童拖鞋。

酒店在一條狹窄的小巷中，通過一個不起眼的大門，眼前豁然開朗，沿着長長的走廊漫步向前，瞬間彷彿穿越了，化身園子的主人，徜徉其中….
不愧是萬科的設計，進入房間就好像回到了家裡。我們預訂的是最普通的房，也夠大。房間是一室一廳一衞的配置，門前有花園，屋後有喝茶聊天休息區域。如果天氣暖和，約三兩好友，甚是chill。
酒店的服務很不錯，管家小羅，小薛熱情，周到。有問題反饋會記錄下來。
在最冷的日子來到蘇州，但卻有暖暖的感覺。房間早就開好地暖和空調。晚上回到房間，竟然還有熱熱的甜品喝，還是放在保温杯里的。離店時還收到了聖誕巧克力。
要説需要改善的地方，就是早飯雖然精緻，但量有點少，品種也無法選擇。如果胃口大一點，不一定能吃飽。
btw，名字叫有熊，果然有可愛的小熊鑰匙扣送。

1. 服務貼心入微，從車位預留，入住接待，暖心小禮品，房間引導，用餐（也提供客户方便時間的房間送餐），退房。客房升級為套房，很寬敞。酒店用品質量槓槓，譬如燒水壺就很特別，不同普通五星酒店，茶具精緻，準備的茶葉口感不錯；愛人説潤膚露特別滋潤。

2. 酒店環境一流，暢園小巧別緻。正好還趕上下雪，別有韻味。
酒店也有一間書房，舒適的沙發，安靜的氛圍很好。

3. 酒店位置姑蘇區核心區域，離平江歷史街區，滄浪亭/文廟都近。酒店也很安靜，適合養心。

酒店給我們做了升級，這次入住的1106房特別滿意，空間大且規劃合理，房間內的備品和minibar飲料也都非常有品質。
值得一説的是酒店的管家服務特別周到細緻，我們的管家小馬小羅給了無微不至的照顧，特別是看到我們帶了長者更是處處關心，要給他們點贊。
美中不足的是老房子的隔音還是略差了一些，以後可能會選2樓的房間更好一些。另外雖然早餐廳景色無敵，但早餐的內容還是略微單調了，特別是西式套餐內容和口味都一般了……

酒店
設施：很新，應有盡有，地暖也很給力，比大部分五星酒店都好（床非常舒服，枕頭柔軟）
衞生：很乾凈，還提供了揶床服務，房間瓶瓶罐罐的也很乾凈
環境：非常非常非常好，房間都是在園林內，也很安靜，沒有嘈雜的聲音，私密性也很好
服務：管家小羅和小薛真的很nice，入住送了一盤草莓，走的時候還特意給了我們明星片和定製的文化巧克力，在園林裏遇見的員工都很和善
早餐有中西式套餐，口味不錯，搭配也很合理

酒店管家服務很好（小羅和小包），有事可以直接聯繫，處理也及時，給免費升級了景觀大套房，房間裏還貼心的調好了燈光點上了香薰蠟燭歡迎，入住體驗非常好！
