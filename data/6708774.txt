msg:I can only say that it is worth the price.
The location is very easy to find. Driving into the scenic area is not allowed. It is recommended that you park in Parking Lot No. 1, check in your luggage in the parking lot, and then walk to the visitor center to check in. Take the sightseeing bus at the entrance with the voucher, get off at Sun Moon Square, and walk for 5 minutes. It can't be said to be troublesome, because all hotels have to go this way, so it is best to treat the journey to the hotel as a scenic spot after checking in. PS: The sightseeing bus can be taken repeatedly with the check-in voucher.
The hotel has no elevator, but fortunately there is only the second floor. The lady will make black tea for you when you check in. The public area of ​​the hotel is not large but the environment is very good. There is a sense of beauty everywhere, and it is also very quiet.
The room is the best! It is very large, very clean, well-equipped and convenient. There are thoughtful fruits and snacks, but I didn't eat them. The hot spring is outside the private bath room. I couldn't wait to soak it as soon as I checked in. It was very comfortable. There is only one thing I hope to improve: the hot spring is outdoors, but the drain switch is indoors... Every time I add water, I have to climb out to the indoor switch and then climb back... In addition to the hot spring, there is also a sauna room. I didn't try it because I don't like it. I have one more suggestion for the room: keep the refrigerator away from the bed. After all, it makes noise when it works. Well, I am too sensitive to noise.
The service is very thoughtful. A staff will take me to breakfast in the morning. Because breakfast is in another hotel... The breakfast is average. I suggest that Thirteenth Sister develop her own breakfast.
Finally, let me talk about why I want to stay in Gubei Water Town. I arrived at the scenic spot at two o'clock on the first day. After taking the sightseeing bus, I walked to the hotel and ate a snack street. Then I soaked in the hot spring until five o'clock, and then I went to line up for a night tour of Simatai. At half past six, I entered the Simatai Great Wall. When I climbed to the top, I saw the sunset. It was very beautiful. Then I looked at the lights of Gubei Water Town below from the Great Wall and the drones performing in the water town. Isn't it more comfortable to look at it from the Great Wall than looking up at it in the town?
It was almost eight o'clock when I came down from the Great Wall. I went to this restaurant in the borderland to eat and watch the water dance light show. After watching, I went back to the hotel to rest. The next day, after breakfast, I took advantage of the fact that the tourists had not come in before 9 o'clock to explore the entire scenic area. I didn't have to worry about being surrounded by people when taking photos. PS: Some people went to the church on the top of the mountain to watch the sunrise, but I didn't get up so I didn't watch it. When there were more tourists, I checked out and took a boat. I also took a look at the waterway and perfectly avoided the large group.

msg:The room is bigger than expected. It is a very good size in Gubei. The water temperature of the hot spring pool in the courtyard is also very good, and the water drains quickly. There are also welcome refreshments. I can't find any problems. If there is a shortcoming, it is an incident of checking out of the room. Because the child of another family in the same group suddenly had a fever, they needed to check out and provided a diagnosis certificate. However, Ctrip did not refund me until I made dozens of phone calls and communicated countless times and was about to arrive in Gubei. I don't know if it is a problem of hotel efficiency or Ctrip's backend efficiency. But the room is really very good, and the aromatherapy machine in the corridor is also great. But some comments say that the butler customer service will call in advance to communicate and inform, I did not receive any phone notification. If you are visiting Gubei for the first time, you may be a little confused and don't know how to get in, and you don't know about the reversing issues involved.

After comparing it with other hotels in the scenic area, I chose this one. The room is very large and clean. It is no exaggeration to say that it can accommodate 4 people. The hot spring is very good, with a constant temperature of 43°, super privacy, no time limit, and very thoughtful service. The snacks and tea in the room are great, and the children like it very much.

First of all, there is a problem with the coverage area of ​​the tatami. You should take off your shoes when entering the tatami space, but currently the tatami is only a place for watching TV and sleeping. Yes, then you have to put on slippers when going to the tea place and bathroom. Second, is the tatami too thin? It is only one centimeter thick. It is recommended that the hotel buy a 5 centimeter thick tatami to feel the difference. Thirdly, the breakfast is too superficial, tastes average, salty and salty, and not delicious. The hotel service is still very good, warm and thoughtful, and they even prepared umbrellas for us when it rained.

The temperature is about 43 degrees, which is just right. The hotel also provides medicinal soup powder. The steam room is also very good and easy to operate. After climbing the Great Wall and visiting the water town, you can use it at any time in the above room. The project I started is simply not that exciting. The Bluetooth speaker in the room is completely set up to match the hot spring steaming. The store owner Niu 🐮 has a very good service attitude. Afternoon refreshments are delivered every afternoon.

msg:Let’s talk about the pros and cons. The pros are that the service is very good, water is provided promptly, the refreshments and sukiyaki provided are very good, and the steam room is also very good. The disadvantage is that in the weather of several degrees below zero, the hot spring is not hot enough and gets cold quickly. The hot spring switch is indoors and cannot continuously discharge water, so the hot spring does not feel like a good soak. It is recommended to boil the water hotter or move the switch nearby. The hot springs are very private and you don't need to wear a swimsuit. Breakfast was served at Gubei Light, which was very rich. Gubei Water Town is really desolate in winter, and there are no drones or anything else. The price of the ice and snow park is simply a money grab. It is recommended to lower the price to increase its popularity, otherwise it will really get worse.

Although I upgraded to another hotel, I really felt that it was inappropriate. The price of Thirteen Sisters and the upgraded Imperial House were not much different. It doesn’t matter to consumers. They choose Thirteen Sisters because the private hot spring pool is in the outdoor courtyard, so it doesn’t matter to the upgrade of the imperial residence. Because the hot spring pool is indoors, the management needs to be strengthened!

Even though the bathing pool is relatively small and the water temperature is not very high, these are acceptable.
What annoys me the most is that the smell in the room is too strong, like the smell of water. This is because the cleaning is not done diligently! A hotel with such a high price really shouldn’t do it!
It is unlikely that I will stay at Goshe Hot Spring again in the future!

There is a capsule coffee machine in the room. At night, someone will help draw the curtain and Desserts are delivered and the decorations are exquisite. The stay is very intimate. The breakfast is divided into Western and Chinese. The photo is Western breakfast. I personally think that Chinese breakfast may be more attractive to me. The attitude of the waiters is very good.

🚗 Transportation: Take the shuttle bus to Riyuedao Station, enter the food street, go up the stairs from the tofu corner, turn left for 20 meters, and you will see the sign. The Gaode map can find two thirteen sisters, the "themed hotel" It is accurate.
The only complaint is that the stairs from the food court are very high. It is not easy to walk with luggage, but fortunately, you can check in and check out. Or take the red line in the picture, but it's a bit winding and uphill.
At night, the Kongming Lantern drone will land on the roof of the hotel and you can see it in the room😎

There is one room that I didn’t choose. Although I didn’t live in my favorite room. Fortunately, although it is a bit expensive, the hotel feels good value for money after staying. The environment and service are very good. Sanitation and impeccable. Breakfast is simple but nutritious. The hotel is located in the center of the ancient town. Wangjing Street is a snack street. It’s also very close to Riyuedao Plaza. Bring your own hot spring pool. You can enjoy the hot spring at any time. Next time I come, I will choose a room with an outdoor hot spring.

這家酒店還有一個吸引我的地方，那就是細節和服務。從陳設到房間配置，每一處都無一不體現出周到貼心。做夜房後為你開好的温泉庭院燈、拉好的窗簾、鋪好的柔軟地墊、關好的飄窗、補充好的飲用水和茶、擺好的小甜點……每一個細節都那麼用心，讓你無時無刻都感到温暖舒心。

總之，我太愛這家十三妹子温泉酒店了。下次再進古北，一定還是堅定的選這家！

設施：房間面積很大，設施齊備完好，居住舒適。每個房間都有湯池，私密性很好。
衞生：乾淨整潔，細節處衞生也很好，且酒店處處都有淡淡的香氣，非常舒適。
環境：酒店位置極好，距離美食街咫尺之遙，去看孔明燈、無人機、音樂噴泉都很近。做到了鬧中取靜，安靜舒適。窗外的景色也很宜人。
服務：服務熱情、主動，前台每次都熱心、耐心接待，幫助解答問題；客房阿姨也能主動問好，面帶微笑，積極協調解決住宿中的小問題。（房間的熱水壺壞了，阿姨積極高效協調，點贊）
早餐：餐食豐盛，有中西餐兩種選擇，不夠還可以添加。是在一個陽光房用餐，環境很舒適，餐廳服務也很好。
最後提一個小小的建議：送的下午茶的小玻璃壺壺口，容易被菊花卡住，導致出水不暢，建議可稍做修改，比如壺嘴加個小過濾棉？或者把壺的規格改一下，讓水流更順暢？

其次，服務很好，房間非常不錯，我就是那種把讓孩子自己玩水的，房間大，沙發夠寬，大人還可以享受濕蒸，自己在房間裸泡也沒問題，享受的就是私隱性。
下次一定還會在入住的。

友情提示：擺渡車到酒店需要走一段樓梯，帶行李箱或行李多的一定辦理託運。

msg:古北水鎮真的是去住了很多私湯酒店，居然才發現十三妹這傢俬湯酒店，定了豪華房，房間裏就有汗蒸房，這也太酷了～
洗手間，淋浴間都特大……房間本身也不小孩子能跑得開～
最主要是室外泡池，一點不會造成房間內潮濕憋悶，特別好～就是開關不在庭院室外，一點不太方便～水温真的特別適合小朋友，對於大人來説可能温度有點低了呢～
房間裏的窗子太美了～下午夕陽太美～酒店本身大庭院裏麪還可以看無人機表演～無人機就停落在酒店庭院裏～很棒～
本來最喜歡御舍，哈哈哈哈來完十三妹最喜歡的古北酒店加上十三妹
提點小建議：寶寶物品可以多增加些，比如腳踏凳什麼的

msg:酒店在水鎮的中後部，但地理位置很好，離無人機，水舞秀，纜車購票處都不遠。工作人員都很熱情禮貌，進了屋會介紹房間內的設施和使用方法。很感謝他們，有求必應，凌晨時間還給送來了蕎麥枕。
泡池是我們泡過的眾多私湯裏最滿意的，池子的大小和深度都讓人很能自如，而且温度在40度左右，既不會太涼也不會讓你覺得燙的下不去。池子頂上好像是楓葉吧，很好看，池子裏有時候會有仰泳的蟲子們，先生説就當是葯浴好了，哈哈。
房間設計的比較好的一點就是泡池，桑拿，洗澡和洗手池都在卧室的外部，這樣就能保證所有沾水的行為都能在卧室外解決，不會弄的屋裡地面也濕答答的。
整個屋子挑高很高，一點不覺得壓氣，除了大床之外旁邊還有一個很大的沙發，睡兩個小朋友都可以的程度。環境也很安靜，床品乾淨舒適，晚上也沒有返潮或其他異味，這點是我很看重所以想特別表揚的。
吃的方面，送了迎賓水果，傍晚來開夜床還送了下午茶，第二天的早餐雖然不是自助但是品類豐富且十分好吃👍
總之，雖然價格不便宜但是物有所值。
提一個小小的建議：這樣的價位，如果冰箱裏的飲品可以贈送的話，是不是更好些？

🍃環境設施：酒店環境倒是挺安靜的 但房間根本沒有汗蒸區（不知道什麼這算不算欺騙消費者）温泉就是一個木質的浴缸！整體房間設定也真的就是加大版大床房 毫無特色..帶孩子加的床圍擋看起來竟然灰突突的。

🔔服務：服務除了保潔大姐+送用品大姐有微笑服務之外 辦理入住+領到房間的人員都是嚴肅至極。

🚗 周邊：距離日月島很近 進來做擺渡車到日月島 在望京街的方向。但是需要上一段高高的大台階 辦完入住也要上樓梯 對於腿腳不好的就不友好 沒電梯

優點：
1.洗護用品用的都是歐舒丹 算是不錯 
2.床品還算舒服..房間隔音效果比較好 

總之：就是如果你帶娃或者帶長者去住 住別的酒店或者別的房型吧 走的時候趕上別的房間退房收拾去參觀了一下 真的不是一點差距。

先説到達，很早就電話跟我確認到達的方式，到達時間，提前報了自駕車牌號，酒店幫忙安排好車停停放位置！到了之後有小姐姐專門在遊客接待中心等我們，幫我安排入住和行李託運到酒店房間。到了房間之後非常貼心得送了下午茶，還主動幫我把牙具送到房間，貼心至極！第二天早上快到早餐結束時間的時候還專門電話提醒用餐時間，總之一路都是貼心服務。我們走了以後專門幫我們把行李又託運到停車的酒店大堂，完全不用操心自己的行李，玩起來非常輕鬆！
再説説房間，超大房間兩個娃一進門就嗨了，房間的温泉簡直太完美了，還有汗蒸房，真是不出門就享受了高級私家温泉。
房間地理位置在食街，出門100米就是水秀表演的地方，離中心廣場也超級近！
非常推薦帶娃家庭入住！完美的旅行！
