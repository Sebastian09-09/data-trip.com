The breakfast is relatively weak and needs to be improved. Since it is a hot spring hotel for leisure and vacation, the breakfast should be better.

You need to pay separately for kissing fish, and you can’t leave in the middle, otherwise you need to pay again.
The advantage is that the service is very good and the service staff are very enthusiastic.

The hotel building is quiet. I stayed there once 16 years ago. The quality has not declined at all, but the restaurant in the hot springs is gone. We need to go out to Quanjude in the hotel building. The steamed fish in the restaurant is delicious and not expensive, and the buffet breakfast is also affordable. My parents gave it high praiseヽ(✿ﾟ▽ﾟ)ノI will come to stay here again next year when it gets cold!

After checking in, he helped us take our luggage and sent it to the room. The next morning, we were going to play ball nearby and needed to have breakfast in advance. The waiter delivered the hot breakfast to the room on time. The room was clean and comfortable, with a large balcony. Although the bathroom was a bit old, it was very clean and the water flow was large. There is a Quanjude restaurant on the first floor of the resort lobby. It is convenient to eat, the taste is good, and the price is acceptable.
You can also soak in hot springs next to it, which is an ideal place for leisure.
We are very satisfied with this stay and give thumbs up frequently! We also recommend friends to go and experience it for themselves.
