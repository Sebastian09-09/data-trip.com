msg:When the National Day was full of people in various areas, it was really comfortable to come to a paradise. The children liked to exercise outdoors every day. The room was very good except that small insects were easy to fly in. The front desk service was very good, but it was recommended to rent a car for more convenient travel. There are many orchards nearby. Now is the apple season, very delicious!

This time I was still worried about not being able to drive after tasting the wine at the winery, but suddenly I found out that the winery had joined forces with Qingpu. This is really great! Qingpu's service is still as high-quality as always, the winery's wine is also unique, and the environment is extremely pristine. I have one more choice for traveling in the future😀

msg:I went to Penglai for a trip before the National Day and stayed at Penglai Longting. The reason for choosing Penglai Longting was the brand of Qingpu Cultural Inn, and more importantly, the winery was attractive to me. The winery is in French country style with a beautiful environment. The room is quiet, clean, well-equipped, and the food tastes good. The service staff was also very friendly. Especially on the second day, when visiting the wine cellar and wine tasting, the accompanying staff introduced the history of Penglai Longting and the production process of wine in detail. In short, it was a great accommodation experience.

msg:The last stop in Penglai—Longting Winery

The first time I knew about Longting was when I watched Xiaopi's video promoting "Haifenglai". The name "Haifenglai" attracted me first. The word "Lai" tells the location of the winery. In my impression, Penglai probably has It is a place with fairy-tale and solemn traditional colors, and the three words "Haifenglai" bring out a freshness and refreshment. Just like the description of this wine in the video, it is refreshing and accompanied by a hint of salty sea breeze.

The first time I tasted Longting was at the CWS booth in May. I was able to experience the full range of wines, including Haifenglai, Haifenglai Reserve, Petit Manson, Orchid... each one is still fresh in my memory. It also allowed me to see the enthusiasm and professionalism of the staff, which gave me the opportunity to have a deeper understanding of Longting, and I had a wonderful harvest in these two days.

The first time I came to Longting, I finished my work assignment in Penglai and thought I would come to Longting to take a look if I had the opportunity. Sure enough, the trip was well worth it! Staying at "Little Manson", opening the balcony door, you will see stone steps, vineyards, fruit trees, villages, coast, ocean... When visiting the winery, you can see the beauty of design everywhere, satisfying all your imagination about the winery. For dinner, the ingredients, ingredients, seasonings, batter, and heat... all show the skill of the chef. In the Dragon Pavilion at night, the lights and stars complement each other; in the Dragon Pavilion in the morning, the first ray of sunshine shines on the park, and the eyes are full of life...Thanks to every staff member for their patience and hard work, and I feel reluctant to leave even after a short stay. Let's talk about it. See you in the future!

msg:Service: Very satisfied, give five stars!
The hotel staff called and added WeChat one day in advance to communicate about the check-in on the day. Because we booked a basic room type, we upgraded to Little Manseng based on the check-in situation. The room was twice as big and on the highest fourth floor. So the scenery outside is also first-class, and you can see a lot of grapevines!
Because we didn't include meals, we ordered dishes during the communication, and the meal time was also communicated, which was very convenient! In addition, the chefs here cook delicious food!
The hotel also specifically asked if a fence was needed, and it was installed when we arrived!
When you arrive at the restaurant, if he knows you have a baby, he will put the baby chair and children's tableware in place, and the same is true for breakfast. Anyway, it's thoughtful!

Facilities:
The entire decoration is in the style of southern France. There is a winery next to it for visiting. We didn't have time to take the baby, so we let the elderly go. My teammates saw someone pruning the vines, so they tried it. You can see the sunset behind the restaurant, which is very beautiful!

The only drawback is that the soundproofing of the room is a little bit average. The people next door sang very loudly. Fortunately, the waiter seemed to be in charge and the sound disappeared after a while.

Environment:
The manor with southern French style is very big and beautiful! It looks good no matter how you take pictures. However, because it is a winery, there is no entertainment and no swimming pool!

The only flaw is that we are actually looking forward to the winery's wine, but when we were eating, the little sister didn't understand it at all and didn't recommend it. She asked us to go to the wine cabinet to choose it ourselves, but I don't know the characteristics of your wine. There is no red wine in the wine cabinet yet. The little sister brought a bottle of orchid from the wine cellar and said that this is the only one. It can only be opened blindly, but the taste is okay. I have been to wineries of all sizes and bought a glass to try. Then if you like it, you can send it in boxes. There is no glass of wine to buy here, and there is no recommended house wine. In the end, there is not even the most basic first wine tasting aroma after opening the bottle. It is directly opened and poured for you. It seems that as a winery, it is a bit lacking! But as a hotel, it is still ok, so the rating will not be changed!

The service attitude of the girl at the front desk is very good, and every staff here is polite, worthy of the Qingpu brand.

The bathroom is even smaller and it is not easy to turn around. The weather is too hot, so we basically move around indoors. The sanitation work needs to be improved.

I am looking forward to it very much. [Happy] Before checking in, I received a call from the front desk asking us what time we would check in and said that they would pick us up in advance because I was with a baby. They also said that they would prepare guardrails for us in advance. It was really considerate. Great! ! [Strong] [Strong] Because our package includes meals and cultural activities, the staff checked the menu with me when I checked in. They were really considerate and asked me if there were any taboos on the menu, including what time to eat, and asked the kitchen to prepare it for us in advance. Speaking of meals, they were really delicious. We had a yellow croaker that day, which was very fresh and sweet. The chef's skills were very good and Shandong seafood was also very delicious. The next morning, we participated in the cultural activities of Fuhu Chengxiang, which led us to experience the local cultural characteristics. The baby liked the experience very much and the experience was very strong. After a day, I became a fan of Qingpu and went back to recommend it to my friends. The service of Qingpu staff was very enthusiastic, the meals were delicious, and the experience of cultural activities was also very strong. Great praise, great praise, I will continue to come back next time and will check in at other Qingpu restaurants [love]

Qingpu is still as good as always. 👍There's no need to say more about Qingpu's service. This winery can see the sea, which makes me, a southerner, very excited. The scenery is beautiful. In addition, I was surprised by the food and art. The food here is very delicious. The chef will use some seasonal seafood, which is very fresh. This time we came to experience the flower cake. The experience is very strong and the teacher is also very professional. Recommended. Thank you very much for the warm hospitality of the service staff. I will stay here next time I come to Shandong.

From Bordeaux and Burgundy in France, Tuscany in Italy, Spain, Hungary, Georgia, to the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, except for Chile and Argentina, I have never been to the Antarctic. In addition to the Yunnan red winery that went to Maitreya last year, the Chinese winery is the Longting winery in Yantai this time! From the moment I entered Longting Winery, I felt as if I was somewhere in Europe, where the meticulousness and attentiveness of the owner can be seen in every corner! It is a great honor to meet the female owner and her young daughter. Her daughter said that Longting Winery is the fourth child of her mother! I admire the entrepreneurial spirit of the female owner, and wish the winery better and better!
