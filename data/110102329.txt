The staff at the scenic spot are well-trained, polite and caring, and they will hold an umbrella for you when it rains. The hot springs, parent-child paradise, and Dafengmen Scenic Area are its special features and are more suitable for families to relax and unwind. If you want to stay in the villa area, the rooms are large enough and the scenery is beautiful. The only drawback is that children should pay attention to mosquitoes.

Breakfast is served buffet style. You can call a car to take you to the hotel lobby when you go out. The WeChat housekeeper Xu Jiamin has a good service attitude and high work efficiency.

The outdoor hot spring pools were OK, but some of them did not clean up the disposable paper cups and towels in time, which made them look unclean and affected the soaking experience. Some pools also had water cups in them. It is recommended to open more pools at night; 4. The outdoor facilities were closed too early, so there was no fun.

I booked a four-bedroom villa for two nights, but was allocated a villa that is close to the construction site and is the smallest one. The front desk explained that the four-bedroom villas were allocated differently because of different prices, but on Ctrip's booking, the same type of four-bedroom villas are all the same price. I was very disappointed and have no intention of going there again.

You can enjoy a soothing massage in the warm spring water, which is really a pleasant experience. Moreover, the environment of the hot spring pool is very quiet, surrounded by green trees, as if you are in nature. The villa has a private swimming pool.

The happiest thing is that the hotel provides a series of activities, so the evening is not boring. Walking in the mountains and forests in the morning, breathing the fresh air and feeling the freshness of nature is very comfortable😊

The hotel park is very comfortable and suitable for walking. There are many projects for children, such as feeding sheep and rabbits... There is also an aerial park on the top of the hot spring mountain. Once the children go up, they don’t want to come down. Jungle crossing and big trampoline, they have a lot of fun!
The hot spring environment is good. The family is very happy to soak. The service is also good. Thumbs up👍🏻
The next day, I went to Dafengmen Scenic Area. There were many projects such as river tracing, via ferrata, kayaking, and rafting. I could play for a whole day. I challenged via ferrata. It was exciting and fun! I recommend everyone to challenge it!
Overall, it was a very good travel experience. All the waiters I met were very polite. The guest rooms were clean and comfortable. The catering products were rich, and there was barbecue. Thumbs up👍🏻

The service ambassador received us and added WeChat. The hotel's business hours and activity albums were sent. The activities in the store were clear at a glance and could be arranged according to your own time. This is very good! The environment of the Phase 3 small courtyard villa I booked this time is pretty good! Away from the hustle and bustle of the city, it makes people feel as if they are in a paradise. The decoration and furniture of the villa are relatively new, parking is also relatively convenient, there is a parking space next to it, the breakfast is also good, and the hot spring is first-class. The spacious courtyard can fully enjoy the beautiful natural scenery, and it is also good to have a barbecue by yourself! The front desk and room service teams are very professional and enthusiastic. Our needs were met in a timely manner. In general, this small villa is very suitable for family travel. 🕍 The large villa is suitable for company team building and business reception. I went to see that there are kitchens 🍱 KTV🍻 swimming pools 🏊🏻 barbecues 🍡 🍢 and tea rooms. The price is also higher, but it is more cost-effective overall. I will invite a few friends to try it together next time.
If you need a hotel with beautiful environment and excellent service, this villa hotel is definitely a wise choice. It will leave you with wonderful memories. I have planned to stay again and recommend this villa hotel to all friends who want to stay in a villa hotel!

msg:Very dissatisfied, the kitchen sink is blocked, the gas stove can't be used, and if you want to rent an induction cooker, you have to pay 200 yuan. You also have to rent a barbecue grill, which also costs 200 yuan. No service is provided and no information is given in advance when booking the room. I am speechless.
