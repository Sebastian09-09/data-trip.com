Unfortunately outdoor swimming pool is closed in Winter schedule. Also,  hope to have handcraft class for kids.It would be great if there is golf + hotel package open to public on weekday.

Amazing restaurants for breakfast and dinner and the staff is as you expect with a world class experience.  If you are in Longgang this is the only hotel you should consider for its immaculate rooms, local restaurants, management and staff.  Vicky Hu has been pure gold with each visit and has gone out of her way to make a foreigner feel welcome. Thank you Vicky!  Cannot wait for my next visit.

The room was well maintatined and facilities were excellent. The view was the lake with the golf course. We enjoyed playing golf as well. The restaurant buffet was fantastic. The hotel provided fruits every day to the room free of charge and the room service was amazing. Highly recommended and we will definetely stay again. A big thank to everyone.

Ms. Jiang at the front desk and the hotel manager were really friendly and warm-hearted, and they gave us a free upgrade for a better suite room. The resort was well-designed in a Chinese traditional way. The vibe was peaceful and good for relaxing after work. We also enjoyed the afternoon tea and happy hours at the executive lounge. The food at the Cantonese and breakfast buffet were really delicious. We will definitely come back again in the future.

I cannot sleep and thus ruin the entire morning schedule of the next day. Also, we asked the hotel help to store our ice cream cake, and they didn’t put it in the fridge, ice cream melted completely.

Other than that, the room itself is great, the amenities is one of the most complete amongst other 5stars hotel. For me, the best was the tub on the balcony. It is so big that it fits two adults just fine.

But the service of the lady at the front desk is very good. She is patient, smiling and answering questions throughout the process.
2. Room. Overall, it is still OK, but the design of the washbasin is not very reasonable. There is no place to put the toiletries, which is not very convenient. I like the fragrance of shampoo and shower gel. The air conditioner is turned on very well, and it is very comfortable to enter.
3. Environment. The balcony scenery is very beautiful, and the mood is very good when you look out! The overall environment of the hotel is not bad, and the entrance is very beautiful.
4. Breakfast. The breakfast is average and can be improved a little bit~~ But it is not a big problem.

msg:The overall facilities of the hotel are good. As a resort hotel, it also has some landscapes, although the overall landscape area is not large. In addition, I think the hotel service can only reach the passing level, and there is still a certain gap from the excellent standard in my mind. The following needs to be improved:
1. The staff's words are inconsistent. At first, they said that they could find someone to open the door for us to see the museum. After that, they really went to find someone and changed the person and said that it could not be opened to us. There are inconsistencies. In fact, I saw that there are already study courses for sale online, including this museum. I don’t know why they refused to let us individual tourists see it.
2. The service is poor. Although the few days of accommodation are busy with events, and there are frequent people and vehicles in and out, they are obviously neglectful to individual tourists. The golf practice vouchers given by the hotel were sent to the driving range by a car. The time was delayed again and again, and I had to urge repeatedly. After urging several times, a waiter even said sorry that I forgot. Is this your service attitude? In addition, we stayed for two days, so we were given 4 coupons. Because the driving range was delayed during the game, and it rained, so we went to practice on the last day. The staff at the driving range said at first that only one coupon could be used per person. The front desk did not explain this to us, but after some negotiations, we were still allowed to use it.
3. During the stay, there was a Volvo golf tournament a few days ago, and the next day after it ended, there was a press conference for the national golf team in Paris. The relevant players and staff stayed in the hotel, and there were many media personnel. There was a frequent flow of people in and out. It seems that the hotel group business is booming. Friends who like quiet should choose carefully.
4. The taste and service of the Chinese restaurant are not satisfactory, and the bill can be calculated incorrectly for me. Fortunately, I looked carefully. The recommended dishes on the first few pages of the two menus I ordered were really unpalatable. One was braised pork and the other was sesame chicken. The braised pork was not sticky at all, like a pre-prepared dish.
5. One day, I saw the hotel setting up the wedding banquet scene. When I went to bed that night, I felt the rumbling sound of the sound test, which seriously affected the guests' rest.

There are Sam's, Sky City, VR and many restaurants, so you don't have to worry about food. I like the separation of wet and dry bathrooms, the bathtub is spacious, and the shower and shampoo brands are very good. The hotel has free indoor and summer outdoor swimming pools, fitness rooms and children's playrooms. It is more affordable and attractive than staying in Hong Kong for a staycation. It's a pity that I don't have time in the hotel. Strolling around in the environment, the feeling of being quaint and far away from the hustle and bustle is quite beautiful. 👍

The landscape of the balcony is full of flowers, plants and trees, you can hear the chirping of birds from time to time, and the air is fresh. The hotel also gave us golf balls worth 30 strokes per person and a coach, which was also a good activity experience. It is open until 9:00 pm, so we still have time to play after dinner. We finished playing that day and then went back to the room to have dinner with **. On the second day, the hotel provided a buffet breakfast with many styles and richness. The buffet environment was high-end and comfortable.

All in all, I was pleasantly surprised by my choice this time. The only drawback was that the bed was too soft and I didn't sleep well.

msg:During the New Year period, we took our son and his classmates on a three-day and two-night trip. This trip was absolutely amazing and cost-effective. The hotel is located in Longgang District. There are several shopping malls within a 10-minute drive of the hotel. Due to the annual holiday, although there were not many shops to visit, we actually found a large outdoor inflatable children's bed-playing paradise on the way, and the two children had a lot of fun. Very happy. You can also go to a nearby shopping mall for lunch later.
The hotel has a unique exterior design, far away from the hustle and bustle, and has its own corner. Entering the hotel is a spacious lobby, the waiters are very polite, and the check-in time is quick. The room is clean and tidy, with plenty of space. It has a sofa for two, a dining table for two, and two five-foot beds. In addition, the room has a large terrace, a large bathtub, two seats and a small table, so you can enjoy the tranquility of nature. Zhao looked out the window on the bed and felt sleepy. Outside the terrace, there were only flowers, plants and trees. Looking out over the lake, you could hear the chirping of birds from time to time, and the air was fresh.
There is a children's wave pool in the hotel, which is clean and well-organized and there are not many people. Two children can have fun while the adults can take a rest.
The hotel also gave us 30 golf balls per person and provided guidance from a coach, which was also a good experience. In addition, the buffet breakfast provided by the hotel has many styles and richness. The buffet dinner was even better, and the environment was more upscale and comfortable. All in all, this choice was very correct and I was very satisfied and pleasantly surprised. The only drawback is the lack of outdoor playground for children.

msg:Because children like duplex rooms very much, we specially booked a parent-child themed duplex room. The room is very large and the balcony can see the golf course. The view is very broad. The hygienic conditions are good, especially the toiletries and small toilets for children, which are very considerate. There are also building blocks, picture books, bouncing balls, small tents and slides in the room for children to play. There are also free cartoon movies on the TV, which children especially like.
The package includes welcome fruit, three golf experience coupons, breakfast coupons and afternoon tea. The staff will use a battery car to pick you up and drop you off to play golf, which is very convenient; the breakfast is a buffet with a complete variety; there are so many desserts for afternoon tea (Picture 1), and none of the three of us finished them.
Finally, I would like to thank the hotel staff. Whether it is the front desk or the restaurant, the attitude of the service staff is very good and makes me feel at home. For example, a child accidentally fell into the fish pond in the lobby and the staff helped to fish it out. ; After the child opened the door, there was a room card that I didn't know where to put it in the room, and we didn't make things difficult for us when we checked out. Thank you very much!

The design of the hotel is in an elegant Chinese style, quite ancient. The service staff are warm and thoughtful, and they are even more caring for children! The hotel's parent-child facilities are perfect, with indoor and outdoor swimming pools and indoor and outdoor children's playgrounds. The opening hours are also long, which is very suitable for weekend vacations with children. The hotel's breakfast options are varied and delicious; there are also many other restaurants with different cuisines to choose from. In general, it is a family resort hotel that is definitely worth recommending!

There may be more people checking in on Sundays, and cleaning also needs to be done Time, there is no room until 4:00, let's have afternoon tea first☕️It's also very good. The room is tidy, the view of the golf course is beautiful, and the room service is also very responsive. High-quality hotel in Longgang District 👍 Will stay again next time ☺️

We were specifically instructed to clean it before check-in because the child's skin was sensitive. But he completely ignored my comment. After staying for two days, the child's skin became red.

msg:Since 2017, I have come to Yinxiu 6 times,
It has always been the best resort hotel in Shenzhen in my mind, and I have brought different people here, and the reviews are all good

But this time I'm a bit lost

I've always felt that although it's a bit pricey, it's still worth it.

Breakfast is not as exquisite as before, and the juice is no different from other hotels (it used to be freshly squeezed juice)

The room changed from capsule coffee to instant coffee￼

Electric curtains to manual curtains

Patio fan removed

As long as you check in, you will have free buffet afternoon tea

these are acceptable

After all, house prices haven't gone up much.

The most unexpected thing is the self-service water bar in the room, and there is a charge for food and drinks in the refrigerator!

I only came here in February this year and there is no charge

In fact, those are nothing compared to the price

I always feel that the style of the hotel is immediately low, no different from other star hotels

Probably the impact of the epidemic is too deep

Of course, service and sanitation are still full marks

msg:Wu Yi and his family chose Yinxiu Mountain Residence to relax. The environment is very beautiful. There are small gardens and hills for tourists to take a walk. Many couples choose to get married here, which shows how beautiful the scenery is. But but the service is really too bad: 1. The service at the front desk is lukewarm, and it really doesn't match the room price. When I called the housekeeper, I got a busy signal. When I called the front desk, I was asked to deliver a takeaway and waited for a long time. Finally, I went down to get it by myself. When I left the store, I saw that others were giving gifts, or they helped take luggage to the elevator. Where was the elevator when I came? They didn't even tell me, and there were no gifts when they left. Why, are you so afraid of repeat customers? 2. I chose Xiuchu for dinner. The waiter is really not as polite as the guests. There is no water when you are seated. You can’t open your mouth when you call for water. It’s really embarrassing. After ordering, just confirm it Send the order to my mother, afraid that my mother will not see what is ordered? The wait for the meal was too long, and someone told us that the meal was refunded before I confirmed whether it would be refunded or not. I didn’t even ask a question to help people make a good choice. Thank you for my difficult choice. 3. The facilities are quite old. The alarm clock in the room even has the function of a CD player, which can be pulled back more than ten years ago in a second; I also want to laugh in the bathtub on the balcony. I can clearly see my mother downstairs on the left hand side from the balcony. Helping the children take a bath, in order to avoid that I am even embarrassed to stand on the balcony to watch the scenery, what about the privacy protection of the residents? Summary: It may be that golf is too famous, so all the energy is in the golf club, so you can think twice about staying in the hotel.

The tables in the room are all pasted with anti-collision *****s, which is very friendly to babies. Special praise for the service. It is rare for non-international chain star hotels in China to provide such good service. During the stay, all requirements can be met immediately, such as adding water, asking for bed surrounds, and adjusting the air conditioner in the corridor. Everything is responded to. Except for the doorman on the first day of check-in, who stood there like a wooden stake and guarded. He didn't say hello to anyone, didn't help with luggage, and didn't help to open the door. I don't know why he was standing there. The doorman the next day was very nice and helped me put my pram and luggage in the boot. The environment is beautiful and quiet, and the breakfast is delicious. It's just that the day we went was just cooling down, and it was cold and windy. There were few things for babies to play in the hotel, and there was nothing to play around, which was quite boring. It's a good choice to go when it's warmer. Special praise to Chen Zhuo at the front desk, we asked for an early check-in time at the hotel, and immediately gave us a room, and took the initiative ➕ WeChat, telling her that we can find her for any needs during the stay. Beautiful and warm. Overall a very professional and beautiful hotel.

You can play golf in the afternoon, drink Tom Yum Kung or eat Japanese food in the evening, all of which are very convenient inside the hotel. Cantonese restaurants are also delicious, but a bit more expensive. There is a small hot spa pool in the swimming pool, which is especially suitable for children or adults to relax after swimming.

When I learned of my son's birthday, I took the initiative to present a pound cake. The fresh cream was very delicious. Accident 2. The service is very considerate. The front desk saw that I ordered a takeaway and took the initiative to call and deliver it (suddenly wanted to eat barbecue at night). Accident 3. The takeaway that I didn't finish the next day helped me warm it up, and the presentation was exquisite like ordering a new dish. 4. The bed is so comfortable, I feel sleepy when I lie down. 5. There are shuttle buses to and from golf, exclusive, on-call.
There were 7 weddings on that day, and it is possible to undertake such a big scene.
There are caring greetings at all times and it feels like they are being warmly treated like friends.
The food in the restaurant is delicious, but a little expensive, about one-third higher than that of a restaurant of the same grade.

She added WeChat throughout the whole process. If you had any questions, he responded quickly. Also helped to book dinner, the location was well arranged.
The hotel facilities have some achievements to be honest, but the hygiene is very good, which is worthy of praise, better than the hygiene of many five-star hotels.
The hotel's welcome fruit was also delivered after we checked in.
Because the hotel's bathtub is outside, there is also a thoughtful reminder that if you think the hotel's bathtub is not clean, you can ask the cleaning person to come and clean it. After making a phone call, he will come to the door soon, and also help us take the children's clothes to dry. Clothes hanger, very comfortable.
There are waiters watching in almost every area, and more than one. The only thing is that the bathroom of the swimming pool is still less staffed. It is recommended to add one or two more people in the bathroom.
In addition, if you want me to propose, that is, the bath towels in the bathroom are still collected at the front desk, which is quite troublesome. This is the second question.
In addition, this trip is very comfortable. The hotel is very big and there are many things to play, but I didn't go because I brought many children.

In the evening, Er Gu pineapple fried rice (still because it is delicious!), in the sound of summer cicadas, strolling along the hotel's walking route, enjoying the tranquility and comfort outside the urbanization, as well as the refreshing fresh air.
At night, under the starry sky, take a sip of tea and wash away the tiredness hidden in the body and mind in the turbulent water (bathtub).
This hotel is really worth staying in. It is not easy to have such a pure land in Shenzhen, which is full of fast pace.

I would like to thank Oda at the front desk here, for the thoughtful service and enthusiasm! The children didn't want to come out playing in the room, and said they would stay there next time.

It is not far from Shenzhen, and the environment is still good. The breakfast is also very rich, and the products are not bad. The service awareness needs to be enhanced. There is no possibility of late check-out, which is very rigid. In general, it is 60 points, the hardware of a five-star hotel, and the service of Samsung.

msg:Because I have been to hotels in Dongguan and Shenzhen in Mission Hills, I think this is another golf club. Today, there should be nothing special, but it is still very pleasant to come here.

First of all, there is the Bobo Pool Hotel. There is a bubble pool on the balcony facing the golf, which is very convenient for family travel with children.

Criticize that the food in the executive lounge is really bad. I haven't eaten such a bad product for a long time. Those cakes feel very cheap. Please ask a better pastry chef. It's really not worth the extra hundreds of dollars. Access to the Executive Lounge. But the executive lounge FANNY and Zhuoli really add points to the executive lounge. The service is very attentive, patient with children, and very gentle. The lovely sister Fanny also gave the baby an extra cute fabric item, leave it for us Thanks to the two young ladies in the executive lounge.
In addition, a person who was in a long state on the Dragon Boat Festival said that the service was really unable to keep up. The room was not available until 3:30. In addition, the price of the restaurant inside was expensive, especially for Thai dishes. It is already five or six hundred to eat, and there is a 15% service charge. It is not recommended for everyone to eat. The breakfast buffet in the morning was very crowded, but it was closed on time at 10:15, and the time was not extended. Some customers kept queuing outside. In fact, there are other restaurants. Is it possible to open another table for breakfast? Don't eat it It's so crowded and messy, no one cleans it up.
In general, the service still needs to be strengthened, the bathing equipment is relatively general, the fruit sent is very fresh, the heated swimming pool is very good, and it should come again.

I am very grateful to the lobby managers Dai Chaowei and Hu Fan for their considerate hospitality. We started 1v1 service at any time before we checked in. Like ~ give the hotel an opinion: the service of the executive lounge during peak hours should also keep up with the service. The manager is in a hurry. No, the customers are also very depressed, and in the end, the chef is ready to make up after everyone is almost finished.

🍃Environment: The scenery from the golf view room is really beautiful and healing, and I thought we were coming to Sanya for a vacation🏖 in the circle of friends! Who would have thought that it was actually in Longgang! There is also a huge 🛁 on the balcony of the room, and the children have a great time playing! The hotel also has a swimming pool. There are two indoor swimming pools, one with cold water and one with warm water. There are also children's favorite wave pools and slides.
We stayed on Valentine's Day, and the room we booked had welcome fruits and red wine as well as Valentine's Day decorations. The hotel butler was very attentive, the decoration was very romantic, and he also left a small greeting card, like heart ♥️

🔔Service: The staff of the hotel are very polite. I brought my child with me. When we got off the bus, he helped me get in the luggage, and when we left, he also helped us with the luggage and onto the bus!
 
🔚: Very good parent-child resort hotel. One suggestion is to replace the children's toothpaste with other ones. The mint is a bit spicy and not suitable for children. There are also children's bathrobes that are suitable for children. The little daughter wears that bathrobe is too big. Children's slippers also need to be smaller.

The lobby manager Dai is very serious, responsible, enthusiastic, and detailed. The hotel in front of the hotel was very angry. Later, Manager Dai's proper arrangement brought us back to a good mood.

It's big, it's very suitable for children to play in the water, my two sons take a dip three times a day... If there is a chance, we will come to experience the outdoor swimming pool.

The 520 set meal in the Thai restaurant (the price is very high, and the public order it temporarily), the two big and one snacks are very filling, the taste is very good, better than expected, at the beginning, I said that I need to make an appoin**ent in advance. Maybe there were not many people on Thursday, so we used it without an appoin**ent. There are two Vanke shopping malls 2 kilometers away. Next to the shopping mall are the Book City of Longgang, the Children's Palace and the Science and Technology Museum. It’s more convenient to live here and walk your baby in these places

From the moment I get off the car at the hotel’s entrance, I receive the supreme VIP service everywhere. It is the personal butler-style service that can only be felt at the Burj Al Arab Hotel in Dubai. Special praise is Jiang Wenqing, a member of the service, who knew that I had brought the elderly to live there, and even arranged the room personally and brought fruits. I found that the old man was inconvenient to move and sent a bath stool. This meticulous and perfect service is very touching. The 86-year-old stayed for two days and didn't want to leave, so we stayed again. Traveling all over the world, this hotel has a good environment, good air, and the best service is warm, no one!

msg:A resort hotel with golf clubs as its mainstay, with plenty of green surroundings and a beautiful environment. The prefabricated wood structure design at the entrance is very eye-catching.
The decoration of the hotel is mostly spent in public areas such as the lobby. The decoration materials in the room are average. The iron and wood partitions in the bathroom and the room are very dusty. It is recommended that you do some cleaning during the major maintenance of the hotel room on weekdays. Use a hot water pot in the room. The power supply of the guidance room has tripped. This is the first time this type of problem has occurred in a hotel. You should replace the kettle or improve the power system. The overall decoration and equipment have a sense of oldness, and it is recommended that the hotel should be updated and maintained regularly.
The buffet at the hotel’s dinner has a wide variety of seafood, and the overall taste is average. There are few seats for breakfast and the queue is crowded. The breakfast is based on the standard of a five-star hotel. There is a lot of room for improvement.
During the Mid-Autumn Festival holiday trips, many tourists brought their families with them, and the service was slightly reduced. I saw a group of guests at the front desk of the hotel noisy cleaning the room too slowly. The cleaning mechanism should be adjusted during the holidays. Another two groups of guests quarreled in the children's playroom due to hands-on guided quarrels, and the hotel attendants had insufficient coordination and handling capabilities in the middle. It is recommended that the hotel increase crisis management training courses.
The hotel also provides golf experience coupons, which will be very fresh and experience for guests who are in touch with golf for the first time.

Advantage 1 The dining is good. I ate two dinners in the restaurant, one is Thai food and the other is buffet. The ingredients are very fresh. The Thai food group purchase is very cost-effective and tastes good. We have lived in Thailand for a few years, so it is still a bit Have a say! And the manager of the Thai restaurant serves very well, but unfortunately forgot to ask his name.
Advantage 2 After I encountered the problem, Cara, the hotel lobby manager, had a very good attitude and actively solved it. Because it was my birthday, he also helped to decorate the guest room and gave cakes, which was quite satisfactory.
Advantage 3 hotel environment is not bad
Let's talk about the shortcomings now
1 I booked a room through Ctrip. The room description of Ctrip is 5-6 floors, and it is a deluxe view room. When it comes to the room, it is on the second floor, and it is very biased. I can't see anything! The air conditioner in the room is also broken, I can’t adjust the temperature by myself, and Ctrip clearly stated that there is fruit delivery, I called the housekeeping depar**ent, and the housekeeping depar**ent said that my room does not contain fruit! This is the first time I have stayed in a five-star hotel and I need to ask for fruit by myself, and I haven't gotten it yet
2Hotel swimming pool, indoor is open to the outside world, there is even training! I took my kids to play in the practice lanes, and I was asked to go to the professional lanes to free the practice lanes! On Sunday, we went swimming again and found that the indoor swimming pool was emptied. Without telling the residents in advance, we had no choice but to go outside. There were a lot of floating leaves, and I was bitten by an unknown bug. I I can only be thankful that I am not a child, so I asked the lifeguard on the shore for help. The lifeguard asked me to go to the office downstairs to treat the wound by myself.
3 Even if the hotel air conditioner is changed to a suite the next day, the air conditioner still has problems. At around 3 o'clock in the middle of the night, the temperature of the air conditioner reached 26.8℃. The child and I were both awake from the heat. Find someone to repair it and stick to it until the morning

1. On the day of check-in, a thin quilt was requested. If the quilt is full, there will be no quilt. Is a hotel not prepared for certain redundant quilts? Reluctantly used a bed sheet as a thin quilt.
2. Choose the executive suite, which comes standard with two cups and two sets of toothbrushes. Feedback that the occupants are two large and one small, and I hope to have an extra set of cups. When I reluctantly brought a glass and hoped to get another teacup, the customer service (not the aunt of the cleaning waiter) was very reluctant. It has been explained that the two majors and one small are staying in, but they have to communicate repeatedly with each other for a set of appliances.
3. The executive room cannot enjoy the tea service on the executive floor. Feedback is for members to enjoy the executive floor services, and they are not eligible for the executive floor services when staying in the executive room. It should be in the hotel sales remarks, membership benefits, rather than star-rated hotel executive floor benefits.
4. On the second day of check-in, it hasn't been cleaned at about four in the afternoon. Call the front desk twice before cleaning.
5. If you apply for a late check-out, it is clear that there are rooms for sale on all platforms today. The room manager does not give any late check-out on the grounds that the room must be cleaned as soon as possible. Usually hotels have special late check-outs for executive rooms, unless the room is tight.
A bad experience!

房間也很大，高爾夫景觀不錯，
美中不足就是孩子在入住前就有點不舒服了，享用了自助餐也吃不了多少
在第2天負一層小童遊樂場玩波波球……孩子之間起爭執，碰到熊孩子和熊爸爸
當時對方兩男兩女（其中男的還挺囂張的），還有三個大男孩個一個大姑娘!
後面我報警處理啦！對方抱歉了
一個好好的假期，在退房前都給其他房客間把心情都搞壞了，也讓小孩都嚇壞了，一直哭回家
看看酒店可不可以有點補償吧。。。

msg:酒店服務非常好，住過好多地方既酒店都未必會幫你開車門攞行李。二樓陽台浴缸房形空間十足，浴缸更比起同類型既酒店浴缸大，一家四口一齊浸都冇問題。清楚姨姨更主動俾浴缸套同幫忙清潔一次浴缸，一點都不嫌麻煩，真的好好！主動問前台姐姐可唔可延遲退房，靚靚姐姐咩都冇講就話可以！真心推薦去下依間酒店室內室外泳池，小朋友波波池，大草地，小公園仲有個餵魚花園咩都有D。就算唔出去玩留向酒店都夠玩，叫外賣仲可以放前台，然後機械人送上門

msg:迎元旦，慶新年，我選擇了隱秀山居酒店
選擇這裏的原因是，這裡有小童樂園，泳池，高爾夫球場，大人孩子都可以玩得開心🥳
我選了間複式親子房
房間設施：
房間是落地玻璃，看風景很不錯，陽台有桌子可以喝茶，室外有浴缸可以泡澡

性價比：
性價比還是比較高，七樓有行政酒廊，一樓有下午茶，開房有贈送免費下午茶，有水果贈送

早餐：
早餐比較豐富，牛奶，飲料，各種點心蛋糕都有

床：
衹有這間（迪士尼房）是可以加床的

位置交通：
位置比較好，也很好找，按照導航即可到達

服務：
服務很好，幫我們加了床加了被子，比較滿意

游泳池：
游泳池是恆温的，人也不多，小孩子玩一下還是可以的，遊樂園衹有波波球玩得較少，所以我們選游泳

健身房：
健身房較大，器材還算齊全，對於喜歡健身的朋友，還是夠用的

整體感覺還是不錯，下次還會再來！

msg:我們住的730房間

睡覺時發覺隔音差 
鄰居上落聲音可聽到

早晚試過均熱水開盡不熱
洗澡後感到冷 
慶倖小孩子在泳池先洗了澡

當在樓上刷牙時
請問水杯應放那裏？木盒上？

遙控器反應不佳 影響看電視心思
樓上趟門不順 蝸肚/關上有困難
以上表示貴司沒有好好檢查

個人覺得餐廳沒有特色
下午茶蛋糕/自助餐/中菜及日式 吸引力下降

本想跟家人去體驗Golf
然而小車稱需有體驗卷才可接送
可否理解貴司只接待會員？

上次來的優點均沒有了
祝貴司客似雲來 再

早餐很好，品種多，服務不錯。

       前台“芷程”服務非常好有求必應。舒適寬敞的房間,房間視線所及的美好風景，以及陽台上暖心的超大浴缸和房間清雅的香薰....很貼心，很舒適，聽説是中日兩國著名設計師的手筆，把酒店的貼心細節做到極致，很贊! 
      很驚喜可以消毒浴缸還有一次性的浴缸套好感十足，床很大很舒服還可以要薄被子，滿眼綠色高爾夫球場，很舒服。游泳池很乾凈很舒服推薦。

另外，臨近聖誕，應景的裝飾，很贊。

1.我們是下午兩點多到的酒店，説五一很忙，然三點多來取房間，三點多去了讓我們等，一直在前台等四點。一個***拿着一疊身份證來辦，隔壁櫃枱馬上給房間，我問為什麼？那***不屑地説你是會員嗎？我懟他**，**花4千多住這破酒店頂你個破會員！！
四點多給我個房間220號房，拉着行李打開門一看：人家一家人穿着浴袍在吃水果。。。去找大堂經理説之前給錯人家了，又是一頓等。。。
吃飯回來停車，有個位置準備停過去，🐶保安過來説：這位置不能停車。兜了一圈回來看一輛寶馬停在這位置上，🐶保安還幫主人拿着高爾夫球袋屁顛屁顛地跟在後麪。。。

連續兩天的早餐都要排隊（**，第一次住酒店吃早餐還要排隊）

房間設定各種差，衞浴用的都是雜牌，頂多就是個三星酒店

大堂經理説賠禮讓我們下午三點才退房，本來沒想要，上午十一點就在收拾行李準備撤，沒一會電話過來説：現在已經十一多了，今天客人比較多，請儘量辦理退房。我説你們經理不是説延遲退房到三點嗎？他説：誰説推遲的？！不可能。。。各種***

msg:1.酒店房間、餐飲、衞生、服務等整體都比較不錯；
2.定義為度假酒店，實際可以娛樂的項目很少；以高爾夫球場吸引入住，但golf球場完全封閉的；
3.酒店的空間實際非常小，院子也很小，很小的活動空間，這一點如果計劃多天度假的要慎重考慮，和圖片上看到的大片golf綠地實際衹是景觀，完全享受不了。

msg:酒店以前住過，但是這次體驗不好。無論是衞生還是管理，都讓人失望。十一前以他們請假半天想早點帶孩子來入住，玩一下，結果4點到酒店説房間還沒準備好，正常入住時間是2點不是嗎？説還需要三個小時才能入住，因為帶了孩子們，想給一間房先休息，説不行，滿房，結果當場查詢攜程各種房型都可以定，就是扯謊沒壓力，就是沒房。雖然是最大套房，在行政樓層，2000多一晚，但是不能享受行政走廊茶店，投訴三次，找到經理，才説，因為入住太晚，特許你們用下午茶。等到6點多才入住，問能不能明天2點再退房，説不可以，滿房，必須12點。忍無可忍投訴給攜程，在這裏真的很感謝攜程，非常負責，一直跟酒店溝通，幫忙爭取，晚上十點多還在給做工作打電話，太拼了。最後酒店在第二天來了經理説補償小童早餐，退房後再用下午茶，延遲退房……總體感覺就是沒有攜程，酒店是不會做任何補償的，對於五星級酒店，服務意識真的太差了，本來度假好心情，結果全部氣飽了，孩子們早早到了酒店，也很失落，如果房間沒準備好，給另外一個房間我們休息一下，我們可能就完全接受，不耽誤玩和休息就可以啊。畢竟不是半小時，而是快三個小時，結果我們入住前兩個多小時都是跟酒店耗，這種體驗不想再有了，第二天補償早餐這些其實都是小事，因為第一天太不愉快了。深圳五星級酒店這種服務我作為深圳人覺得有點丟人

酒店環境很好，綠樹成蔭。設施齊全，泳池挺大的。送了高爾夫體驗券，30個球不夠玩再追加了100個，運動量足夠了。
酒店服務及餐廳服務都不錯，但是我購買的套餐有200元spa券，前台告知Spa沒開所以不提供。經過Spa館時看到有小姐姐預約了下午3：00Spa並有服務員引領了進去。這是前台業務不熟練還是其他原因不可提供？體驗感非常不好！！！
