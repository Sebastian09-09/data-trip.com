msg:Good hot springs. You get complimentary tickets as you check-in. 
Breakfast is nice. They have mix of Western and Chinese food. 
The view is amazing
Room was spacious and clean 
Swimming pool facilities were alright  

The place gave a vibe of retirement house. A lots of Chinese grandpas and grandmas ruin five-star hotel magic by their rural behaviour. 

The customer service doesn't meet 5 star hotel grade. We met only 1 staff who was able to speak English. There is no any food service in hotel after 11 pm which is also shame for 5 star hotel

During my stay, although was just one day, York was very attentive to my request. He personally led us to our room after the check in. He will text me to update on the best timing to have breakfast, to view the light up of the hotel and more.
Andy was very patience in helping me to checking. As it was our anniversary, Ms. Andy initiated on giving us a cake and a bottle of red wine for our celebration.
Kudos to both of you.

msg:The lobby is beautiful and so is the entire hotel. Really liked our big tub in our room, automatic curtains, lake view, and rainfall shower. 

There is an outdoor pool, but it was still cold season so it wasn’t open, but I imagine it would have been great. We used the indoor pool, which was heated and had a nice view of the lake.

We ordered room service dinner the first night. The prices were the same as the restaurant and arrived in about 30 minutes. Nice job! The taste was ok, not amazing but for the price I won’t complain too much. 

The staff was super helpful and friendly. They always tried to give me staff who could speak English even though I didn’t need it. They gave us a tour of our room when we checked in and whenever I called the front desk to ask for anything, they brought it to our room immediately. Absolutely wonderful service 

The only negative I have is about the food itself at the hotel buffet restaurant (the other restaurants were closed at the time so we only ate at the buffet in the lobby). The buffet dinner is roughly 300rmb per person on a weekday and includes alcohol. The choice of food and quality was honestly not even worth 100rmb in my opinion, but I also hold the hotel at high standards. I’ve never seen an international dinner buffet with no bread before. Though to be fair, the majority of guests were Chinese ayi’s at the time and it was off season, so perhaps they adjusted the food to their taste, not that of a foreigner.

Lastly, the hot spring facility was good. It’s actually at the neighboring hotel, but they give you a free golf cart ride there and back. There’s changing rooms. The hot springs are actually indoor with a glass ceiling (that you can’t see through). There are a TON of hot springs, definitely more than usual. I didn’t count but I think I saw more than 15 or 20 different pools. My only complaint, and it’s a big one, is people were smoking in the hot springs and it really pissed me off.

The front desk staff is even better, smiling and responsive. After learning about my needs, they immediately solved them for me! Every service staff deserves praise! Worth recommending!

Because I didn't bring a swimsuit, I didn't enjoy the hot springs, and the travel photography was given as a gift. The makeup girl was very good and sweet, and the guy who took the photo was very patient, with strong skills and fast speed, and the photos were amazing. He gave away 3 quick-edited electronic photos for free (the excess amount was 80 yuan per photo).

The architectural style is indeed very distinctive, the night view is particularly beautiful and dreamy, and the service is also very good. There are special people to provide telephone services before check-in, check-in, and after check-in, and they answer questions patiently. Thumbs up. The room is large, but because of the special structure, each room is irregular and not as spacious as expected. It is just divided into several small functional rooms. The balcony is very large. We have a view of the Rainbow Bridge in one room and a view of the lake in the other. We can see the sunrise, which is quite a surprise. I will consider coming again and hope to keep up the good work.
For the free services: 1. 1 hour of beautiful photo shooting (3 quick-repaired electronic photos): 3 electronic photos are added to each room, and the excess is 80 yuan each. I have to sigh that the photography brother has strong skills and quick repair speed. The photos are really amazing. For the aunts who wanted to be stingy, they were reluctant to give up and bought a few souvenirs; 2. Free hot spring project, battery car pick-up, on-call, 2-minute drive, thumbs up

The front desk said that it would cost an additional 300 yuan. The worst was yet to come. The room had a bathtub, but they did not provide a plastic bag for the bathtub or bath salts. How much was a plastic bag? Can't they provide it for free? We had to go downstairs to buy them. The mini bar in the room was charged, and a small can of beer cost 58 yuan. At 9:40 pm, there was no light in the hotel or nearby. It was pitch black. The lights in the hotel room were dim. The management of Sheraton is terrible. I remembered that when I checked in at Sheraton Haikou last year, I found that the quilt cover had big holes and cracks.

The hotel has a beautiful exterior and looks great when the lights are on, but the software inside is average, the facilities are old, and the service is not worth the high price. I booked a river view room, and the room price rose to more than 3,600 yuan during the May Day holiday. The room is not big, and the price-performance ratio is average. The advantages are rich breakfast categories, free travel photography, and free hot spring tickets (I didn't go on May 1st). It's okay to walk around and take pictures outside the hotel. At 18:00, the Moon Hotel lights up and there is a light show, which echoes the water show of the Rainbow Bridge. Taihu Ancient Town is 4 kilometers away. You can go for a walk at night. The night view is beautiful. There are light shows, water dance shows and fireworks shows on holidays, which are worth seeing.

Huzhou Taihu Sheraton, a landmark building in Huzhou, has many luxurious elements, but it's a bit "old". I came by chance this time. The front desk helped to raise the floor for free. I can see the scenery of Taihu Lake when I open the balcony. The facilities are complete and clean. It was rainy for the past two days, which is different. The breakfast has many categories, rich and delicious, better than Hangzhou InterContinental. I personally think that the mini bar should be free, and the charge is quite high. It's inconvenient to order takeout. You need to go downstairs to get it yourself, which affects the experience. I also tried the free hot spring ticket. There are not many people. There are many pools to soak in. It's very comfortable. There is a shuttle bus to go directly.
Meipai 1 hour (3 quick-edited electronic photos): I didn't experience it. I'll come again next time hahaha

First, when we checked in, a male waiter spent a long time on the computer to carefully select three defective rooms for us. Two of them were in the same location, not right, but at the corner, with a small balcony and surrounded by windows. Another room had a big pillar, and we saw the big pillar as soon as we entered the door. It was too much. We went to negotiate and they changed it to another one. So it can be confirmed that the good room was saved first. I don’t know what was messed up in the system. Secondly, it was the first time we encountered a hotel that did not arrange fruits for check-in, which just felt bad. Thirdly, we forgot a facial cleanser and told them that it was in the shower room. It was outrageous. They said they didn’t find it. I called them the second time to ask them to confirm, and they said it was in the shower room. Are the waiters stupid or bad? Do you dare to stay in such a black-hearted hotel?

The key is that when I got the room, the extra bed was not put in the living room; the morning was even more average, the chef who cooked noodles and wontons kept cooking noodles, even if no one took the noodles, he kept cooking, and the noodles and wontons were all mushy), ③ The hygiene is really bad, there are flies in the room, and the hygiene is impossible to improve because of the old facilities, ④ If you go to the Dragon Dream Park Taihu Ancient Town, it is recommended not to stay here, it is too far away, ⑤ The price is very expensive, the so-called suite in the corner is almost 5,000, and the general one is 2,500.
In a word, it is really not worth staying!

msg:Overall it was pretty good. I also went to the hot springs. There were not many people. It was decorated like a tropical rain forest and the experience was great. The hotel staff were generally enthusiastic. The cleaning staff also wrote notes and put more water. It was a good experience. You need to queue up for breakfast, but you can only go in if there is a seat. This is okay, better than the crowds. Next to it is the Taihu Lake cruise, 60 per person, more than half an hour, very artistic. There are really many people on the Rainbow Bridge. Fortunately, I went to see it on the first day. The hotel has too few catering facilities. At about 20:00 on the first day, the Chinese restaurant said that it could no longer order food, so I had to go to Dicos. It would be better if the hotel could consider the late tourists and extend the business hours appropriately.

msg:Huzhou Sheraton Hotel: A perfect blend of lakes and mountains

Huzhou, this beautiful Jiangnan water town, always attracts tourists from all over the world with its unique charm. The Sheraton Hotel, located in its bustling area, has become the first choice for tourists with its high-quality service and superior geographical location. I recently had the honor of staying here and experienced its unique charm in person. Now I will share my feelings with you.

First of all, the geographical location of Huzhou Sheraton Hotel is very advantageous. It is located on the south bank of the scenic Taihu Lake, with a panoramic view of the lake and mountains. Every morning, when I open the window, the fresh air and the sparkling waves on the lake always make me happy. Moreover, the transportation around the hotel is very convenient, whether it is to the city or other attractions.

Secondly, the service quality of the hotel is impressive. From the moment I checked in, I felt the enthusiasm and thoughtfulness of the staff. They always smiled, patiently answered my various questions, and provided me with a lot of practical suggestions. The facilities in the guest room are also very complete, and the bed is comfortable and soft, so that I can have a good sleep every night. In addition, the hotel also provides a variety of dining options, whether it is the exquisite dishes of the Chinese restaurant or the exotic flavors of the Western restaurant, they can satisfy my taste buds.

I also spent a pleasant leisure time at the Sheraton Huzhou Hotel. The hotel's swimming pool and gym facilities are first-class, allowing me to maintain a healthy lifestyle during my trip. In addition, the hotel also provides a variety of entertainment activities, such as yoga classes, Tai Chi performances, etc., which made me feel relaxed and happy physically and mentally.

In general, the Sheraton Huzhou Hotel provides tourists with a perfect holiday experience with its superior geographical location, high-quality services and rich leisure facilities. If you plan to travel to Huzhou, you might as well choose to stay at the Sheraton Hotel. I believe you will fall in love with everything here like me.

After arriving at the site, we felt that the room was well maintained, and the sofas and carpets were kept clean. The room was also relatively large, with a large balcony and a good view. We lived on the 17th floor. We stayed in rooms 1756 and 1757. In comparison, the scenery and view from room 1756 were much better. I would like to give it as a reference for those who are going there in the future. I seem to have forgotten to take pictures of the room, so I just put some pictures here to make up for the number.

The girl at the front desk also helped to upgrade to a lake view room. At five in the morning, you can see the sunrise in the room. The air is fresh and birds fly over the terrace. It is very suitable for vacation. The hotel also has hot springs and a wide variety of buffet breakfasts. The only difference is that there are not enough service staff. Overall, the accommodation environment is worth coming back.

We happened to stay on April 3, so it was quite cost-effective. We were given two hot spring tickets and breakfast. This price is worth it. The hot spring is very good and the breakfast is rich.

I wanted to wait for the fireworks show but it was too late so I returned to the hotel. Why did I take a taxi? Because many parking lots have mechanical parking spaces.

The service reflects the standards of a five-star hotel, plus a star🌟. The spring breeze blows in the room, and there is no doubt the beautiful view of Taihu Lake. The Rainbow Bridge opposite is brightly lit at night, and the environment is perfect👍. The bathroom is spacious, with detailed areas, soft linens, and comfortable details. Secondly, in the parent-child activity area, babies have endless fun playing in the sand and sliding on slides. They can take a leisurely stroll and appreciate the iconic moon building, which is shocking🫨! Next, the breakfast is grand, with a complete range of Chinese and Western pastries, Japanese light meals, Huzhou hometown dishes, and milk drinks are divided into full-fat, skimmed, etc. I will probably stay at Moon Hotel again in my spare time.

I went to take a dip in the hot springs at night with the coupons given. Overall, it was a good review. The various pools have different effects, so I tried them out.

The hotel is equipped with a dedicated housekeeper. Housekeeper Zhang Lijuan is very good. She took us back to the room from the time we checked in. After arriving in the room, we were introduced to the facilities in the room in detail. He also saw us off personally when leaving, which was very considerate.

I will come again if I have the opportunity in the future.

When I checked in, the lady upgraded the room and I checked into the 21st floor directly. The room was a one-bedroom and one-living room, which was very comfortable. Wow, there is also a large balcony with a great view and a beautiful view of the lake. Surprise! The night view is stunning!
It was my first time to stay in a hotel and there was a housekeeper. Sister Lijuan was so nice, she was pretty, had a nice voice, and the service was perfect. She sent us to the room, and she was always caring and gave us a lot of tips, what to pay attention to when going to the hot spring, and the surrounding attractions. Guide, early reminder the next day, so considerate. Recommendation: We also saw the Saturday fireworks in Taihu Ancient Town. We were so excited as we have not been able to set off fireworks for many years! Must give Lijuan a thumbs up👍👍👍👍👍👍
I like the Moon🌙 Hotel and will go there next time.

I have to complain about the breakfast, it was a mess🥴. I guess there were too many guests and the service couldn't keep up for some reason. Going after 8 o'clock might be considered a peak time. It was good to have a lady take me to the seat after queuing. There was no food in the back. The usual places are either not available, empty, or the queues are long. And the breakfast is not rich. It is basically the same as the villa hotel opposite, but the quality is completely different. Overall, the experience was so-so, far from what I expected.

The hotel is built on Taihu Lake. Although the lake view room is more expensive than the mountain view room, it is really worth it. The room is bright and spacious, with lake views from both sides. Even the bathroom can enjoy the beautiful view of Taihu Lake. The bathroom is very reasonably designed and clean. Wet and wet separation, there is also an oversized bathtub, the stay is very comfortable, the service is also very good, and all requests are answered.
The lights are turned on at 6:00 in the evening. It is really beautiful to see the illuminated hotel on the Rainbow Bridge.
The only drawback is that the breakfast is unsatisfactory. Maybe it is the off-season for tourism and the chef is not very attentive. Although there are many varieties, the taste is not good, especially the boiling time of the eggs is too long, the outer ring of the egg yolk is dark, and there are small wonton meats. Not very fresh.

Facilities: Too old, which really proves the age of this hotel

Hygiene: From the cups in the room to the tableware in the restaurant, they are all defective ~ so check carefully before use

Environment: Since the hotel focuses on hot springs, it is surrounded by hot spring hotels~ and there are really a lot of people coming and going, so the environment is only as good as that.

Next I want to mention breakfast~ It really opened my eyes. People from two places had breakfast here together and queued for an hour~ The key point is that Sheraton didn’t differentiate between administrative and above levels. I felt that this time It’s not worth it~ The only thing worth it is the butler’s service~

Anyway, I don’t think it’s worth coming here a second time~

We were also helped to carry our luggage up to the forest floor, and everything was done just by asking via WeChat, making us feel like VIPs! The stay experience was great!

The hotel's facilities are first-class, the sanitation and environmental work are excellent, and the scenery is particularly beautiful. The hotel arranged two rooms for us to face the city, and the light show at night is amazing.
I especially want to praise the two young waiters at the hotel entrance. As soon as they saw us four old people parking the car in the cold wind and drizzle, they immediately rushed over to enthusiastically help us with our luggage, supported us, and took the initiative to explain the underground parking in detail. Driving route to the venue, dinner options, etc. There was also a handsome waiter named Scott and Xiao Su. He not only helped two elderly couples carry their luggage to rooms 1758 and 1759, but also carefully and patiently explained to us the use and precautions of the room and balcony facilities. Feel very friendly!
The hotel's breakfast buffet is particularly rich, with fresh ingredients and all important Chinese and Western breakfast items. The high quality of coffee and cheese is especially rare!
The waiters at the lobby bar and the front desk are also polite, gentle, warm, and natural!
Thank you to the management and all staff of Sheraton Huzhou Hotel for bringing us such joy!

msg:The hotel service is good, with butler service. The butler Xiao Zhang enthusiastically introduced the hotel's supporting services, surrounding tourism, and catering conditions. The balcony of the room is super large and has a good view, with a sweeping view of the city and lake. It's a pity that it's winter, otherwise it would be very pleasant to make a pot of tea and read a book in the wind. The room is not small and the bed is big and comfortable. In addition to the shower, the bathroom also has a large surf bathtub that can accommodate a family of three. The lake and mountains are beautiful outside the window, and the heat waves are rolling in the window. It feels definitely better than the hot spring next door. Of course, there have been vicissitudes of life over the past ten years, and some of the hardware is not as good as expected, but the flaws do not hide the advantages. Whether it is Moon Bay or Horse Circle, it is worth a visit.

I also asked about the size of the bed because I was traveling with my son. When I arrived the next day, I found that I had been upgraded to a parent-child room. I must give it a five-star rating because of this. The room is big, the bathroom is big, and the balcony is big. The room layout is reasonable, with a dressing room and a small TV in the bathtub. The breakfast is rich and the yellow croaker noodles are delicious. The hot spring is designed like a tropical rainforest, but apart from the hot spring pool, there are no supporting facilities. The changing box is the smallest I have ever seen in my life. Needless to say, the night view is a landmark of Huzhou.

Standing on the wide balcony, we can overlook the beautiful scenery of Taihu Lake and the light show at night. It has an unobstructed view and a good view. The butler Li Yuanchen was very attentive in his service. When he saw that there were not many guests in the breakfast room after eight o'clock in the morning, he immediately informed us to come and dine quickly to avoid the dining rush hour. We went to the hot springs and called a taxi for us. Thank you for his considerate service.

The health and facilities basically match the positioning of a five-star hotel. The service can only be said to be acceptable, but it may be related to the fact that the occupancy rate is too high and it is too busy. The Moon Hot Spring is quite unique. You can go through the tropical rainforest and enter small pools. The Xiaoyu Hot Spring charges an additional fee of 28 yuan per person, which is a bit too high. Finally, let’s talk about the food and beverages. The breakfast was so-so, nothing particularly attractive. There were too many people and the queues took a long time. There were too many cakes for afternoon tea, but the taste was average. The three of us ordered two portions and there was still a lot left. There were two people at the next table. The desserts are basically untouched. The coffee latte art is very unique. I like it.

The family room I booked was given a room on the 10th floor, which was pretty good. The hotel is old but seems to be well maintained. After checking in, the hotel's personal butler Scott Xiaosu took the initiative to add WeChat and served us throughout the process. If we have any needs, contact him in time and reply as soon as possible. The service is very considerate. Stayed for 2 nights, there were not too many people on Friday night, but obviously there were more people on Saturday night, which shows that it is still very popular. When you stay at the hotel, you get a hot spring ticket, which is great. The environment around the hotel is also great, and the surrounding restaurants can also meet the needs. Overall, it is a very good experience.

Although I didn't enjoy the most affordable package trip (you need to make a reservation 1 day in advance), the hotel's attentive service was very warm! Checked in at 8:30 on Friday night. Because I was traveling with an 11-year-old child, I called in advance to reserve a high-rise lake view room (to watch the sunrise over the sea). I also received an extra hot spring ticket and a breakfast coupon. When I arrived at the front desk, The caring housekeeper, Miss Wenxin, is all satisfied! He also personally guided us to check in and added WeChat to interact with us all the time, which was a great surprise! Sheraton is a long-established seven-star hotel with very good environmental facilities. The crystal lanterns and Persian jade in the lobby are very impressive! The facilities in the room are quite satisfactory and the areas are clearly defined! There is also a bathtub with a view! The kids love it! There is a large open-air terrace. It will be very pleasant to have afternoon tea when it is not cold! Today is the time to see the sunrise more clearly! After checking out at noon, the housekeeper, Ms. Wenxin, also reminded and guided us to check up on the hot springs, arranged a free shuttle bus and hotel bathrobes, and informed and communicated via WeChat back and forth! Very warm! Looking forward to staying again next time!

It is recommended not to go there if it is too cold with children. It is recommended to bring your own swimsuit. Buying it on site is very cheating. A pair of swimming trunks is 128.

After searching, I found that Shanghai is very close to Huzhou, and then I checked in the “toilet seat” that I had always kept in my collection. I was shocked when I saw it from a distance. The hotel is really spectacular. Check-in was also very convenient, and the butler Jingjing's service was also very heart-warming. She helped upgrade the lake view room and gave children hot spring tickets. The family was very happy. When checking out, Jingjing came over to say hello and gave two small Chris**as gifts to the two children at home. A perfect weekend trip! The Caiyuexuan Chinese restaurant in the hotel is also very delicious. We had dinner and lunch the next day in succession. There were no bad dishes, both were delicious!

Since I arrived early, I went through the check-in formalities and added the housekeeper's WeChat message to notify the check-in. In my spare time, I took a taxi to Yishang Street for a tour. I picked up the hotel at around three o'clock. I received the check-in news and received the LAVAZZA coffee in the lobby bar - the taste was average. I didn’t go to the hot spring ticket for free. I was overwhelmed by the waves of people. The only problem in the room was that the automatic switch on one side of the curtain failed. Fortunately, the other side worked. With it closed, you don’t have to shower with the naked window🛁 The only thing I didn’t expect was that there were so many people waiting for breakfast. The hotel didn’t have a good diversion plan. It turned out that the dining area was not very big. When I encountered such a large passenger flow, I gave up. But after that Thank you very much to the housekeeper for her understanding and adjus**ent, which gave me a satisfactory solution and added a bit of human touch to the hotel!

The Sheraton Toilet Seat Hotel can be said to be one of the most beautiful scenery beside Moon Bay in South Taihu Lake. Whether you live in it or nearby, you will always go to Moon Square and stop to take photos with it.
The hotel room is quite satisfactory, but the decoration is a bit old. Both the bedside and the leather of the boss's chair have accumulated some age staining. Hair dryers, toothbrushes, slippers, cosmetics and other supporting facilities are slightly out of date compared to the newly born resort hotels.
In addition to the rooms, the gym, bar, and restaurant included in the hotel are all relatively small. Fortunately, the housekeeper reminded me during breakfast in the morning to avoid the morning rush hour, otherwise I might encounter the embarrassment of waiting in line. Because there is Moon Bay Plaza Commercial Street outside the hotel and Taihu Ancient Town 3 kilometers away, it is more cost-effective to eat out for lunch and dinner.
Finally, I would like to thank Ctrip's housekeeper Geng. She is very kind and patient. You can see her busy in the lobby from afternoon to evening. If you have any questions, you can contact her.

The hotel service is very attentive and the check-in experience is very good. The butler Leo's service is very good.

In addition to the hot spring tickets provided by the hotel, the itinerary is very rich. There is a shuttle bus at the door to the hot spring, which is very convenient.

The breakfast is very rich. Around nine o'clock, when there are the most people, you need to queue at the door. On New Year's Day, the hotel will organize some activities for children. When we left, there were staff making marshmallows. No wonder most people in the hotel come with children.

The hot spring starts at two o'clock in the afternoon. There is a shuttle bus in front of the hotel that goes directly to the hot spring. You can bring your own hotel bathrobe. After all, it is a bit cold when you come out of the water. If you don't bring it, you can rent it there for 20 yuan, and the bath towel is free. There are about a dozen kinds of hot springs indoors, as well as a paddling pool. Drinking water is provided for free. You don’t need to bring it yourself. If you want to take pictures, you can bring a waterproof mobile phone case. You can buy one at the hot spring for 30. After soaking in the hot springs, come out and take a shower. There are basic equipment such as a hair dryer, and you can dry your swimsuit. After soaking in the hot springs, you can go back to the hotel to rest and have dinner.

I booked a lake view room online, and the front desk upgraded me to a lake view suite. The hotel lobby is bright, with a large area of ​​​​crystal lamps dazzling. The room has a large curved balcony with a wide view. The hotel service is also good. I called in advance to inform me that the hotel has a hot spring.

Water is everywhere when the faucet is used. There is insufficient air conditioning in the whole hotel. Everyone wears down jackets for breakfast. , how dare you call yourself a seven-star hotel? Really, the 600-700 Nantaihu Villa across the street is better than it. Anyone who is willing to be a leek can go there. But the butler service is very good and considerate!

I bought a package that includes accommodation, breakfast, hot spring tickets and afternoon tea. Generally speaking, it is good, but the hotel is too big, and it takes a while for people staying in Jade Tower to go back and forth😅! I'll stay at the Crystal Building next time I have the chance!

The location is excellent, with a panoramic view of the lakes and mountains, and everything you need for entertainment in the surrounding environment. It is worthy of being a high-end luxury. The hotel makes people forget to leave.
What warms our hearts even more is the hotel's service. The front desk specially upgraded us to a lake view room without an elevator. What's even better is our butler Du Tonghui. The young man is warm and thoughtful, and provides personal service throughout the process. He not only helps us carry our luggage, but also helps us along the way. He escorted us to the room, helped us turn on the electrical appliances, and guided us in using them. Toiletries, slippers, coffee in the lobby, etc. were all arranged for us. All details were taken care of. The most touching thing was seeing that we have elderly people with limited mobility. He helped us handle a late check-out, allowing the elderly to have a better rest. Our whole family is really grateful to him!

msg:From 23rd to 25th of this month, I wanted to take the elders and children on a family trip. It was my first time in Huzhou and I chose the iconic hotel. Before checking in, I received a call from the hotel in advance to help us upgrade the room. We checked in at 0755 0756. One is a parent-child room. The king-size bed plus a single bed really meets the needs of a family with a second child. There is also a large bathtub where you can watch (cartoons) while taking a bath. They also thoughtfully provided hot spring tickets. Unfortunately, the temperature suddenly dropped and I didn’t need to bring a swimsuit. Daring to take children to the hot springs is a waste of the hotel's good intentions, so the bathtub has become a very critical piece of hardware. The hotel service has to be said to be in place. From the moment the car was parked, the handsome guy was there to arrange it~ OPPO seemed to be having a meeting that day, so the hotel occupancy rate was basically The bus was also full. Fortunately, I came a little early and there was an underground parking space. Along the way, I saw young ladies and brothers who would greet me warmly and help me with my luggage. I added the butler’s WeChat account and communicated with many questions as soon as possible. Although the hardware is a bit old and cannot be compared with new hotels, the service is still good. The children and parents are very satisfied~ I feel very much about the full online service of the housekeeper and the patient service in the guest room. I also hope that the hardware can effectively improve the contemporary Some of people’s needs~ After all, many hotels are now offering parent-child programs~ The children’s paradise is indeed only a little weak for young children to play for a while. I hope I can have the opportunity to stay here next time~

The sanitation is good; the service is first-rate; the view is superb. From the doorman to the cleaning staff, they were very meticulous and considerate. Special thanks to the housekeeper, Ms. Geng, and the girl at the front desk.

This trip to Huzhou became warm because of you. I will still choose Sheraton when I go to Huzhou in the future.
Finally, I would like to make some small suggestions: can our internet speed be improved, and can we have more breakfast varieties? ; Can the bathroom door be blocked from light——————————Check into room 1251 on November 22nd

Booked a four-person connecting room with high-altitude lake view and stayed in room 1556. I made a note when booking the room. The hotel placed birthday lights in the room, gave me a rich fruit plate and snacks, and also gave me a birthday cake. Thank you! The view from the room was great, with both a lake view and the Rainbow Bridge. I also saw a beautiful sunrise in the morning. The food in the Chinese restaurant is very good, the portions are large and the taste is good, and the service is very good. What I need to complain about is that the bedside socket is too inconvenient and the room type is a bit convoluted, but the service makes up for all shortcomings, especially the housekeeper, Miss He, who is warm and friendly. She always sent us to the room with a smile, answered our various questions, and provided a lot of information. Information, parents like her very much.

Unexpectedly, the room I was initially assigned had only one office chair to sit on, and the TV was on the right side of the bed. This 90-square-meter room does not feel like a spacious and comfortable vacation a**osphere at all. The spatial layout is very difficult to use, and there is no air conditioning or hot air. I remembered the photos I saw when booking a room on Ctrip. I opened it and found that there was a sofa in the photo. I immediately contacted the hotel housekeeper Talia Xiao Tang. After her coordination, we were moved to another building. The room at the back was generally OK. , I would like to express my gratitude to Miss Tang for her sincere service before and after the run!

Parking: Although there is an underground parking garage, there are not many parking spaces, and most of them are lift parking spaces, which are difficult to park. When I left the store, I found that the tire rack of my car was scratched.
Overall, I am most satisfied with the service provided by butler Xiao Tang. The room service is also good.

When I checked out, I came across the greening spray 😂 I almost thought it was on fire

The light show at night is very beautiful. Although there is only one building, the light show is very eye-catching in both colors and patterns.
Also because of the shape of the building, there is only one side of the guest room, so there is no noise from the guest room opposite. It seems much quieter, and the balcony is very large.
The treasure of the hotel in the lobby is a giant piece of Persian jade and a smiling Miller, which is quite special.
The guest room is surrounded by mountains and Taihu Lake. It is very close to Fisherman's Wharf. It is very convenient if you like to eat farm food.
The hotel service is very good, breakfast and Chinese restaurant are both good

msg:After struggling for a long time, I decided to stay at the Huzhou Sheraton. The reason for the struggle was that the room price during the National Day was too expensive (deluxe twin room ¥2200).

The facilities in the room are quite good and meet all my expectations. However, the decoration and interior are a bit old, maybe because of the age. For example, the TV is small and not high-definition.

I booked a non-lake view room, but I could see a little bit of Taihu Lake. In the evening, enjoy the breeze, watch the people coming and going on Rainbow Bridge, and watch the fireworks in Taihu Ancient Town.

Hot spring tickets were given as a gift when we checked in, but we were not interested. We wanted to ask the front desk to buy breakfast at a discount, but the front desk did not agree. The hot spring ticket was wasted.

The customer service called us twice to ask about our stay and also gave us welcome fruits, which is worthy of praise👍

Sheraton's lake view room is really one word: absolutely amazing! Just look at the pictures and you will know that the scenery of Taihu Lake kills everything in seconds! The room is not as old as mentioned in the previous reviews, at least the hardware is qualified (smart + brand blessings are OK). Maybe the jade decoration style looks a bit messy visually.
It's a pity that I didn't have time to go to the hot spring because of the itinerary, so I wasted three free tickets. I hope I can go again in winter.
There is no fault in terms of catering. There are no particularly outstanding dishes but it is OK. However, we only used the buffet and did not go to the Chinese restaurant, so we cannot comment. Internet celebrity attraction Moon Bay - the night view of the toilet seat is really beautiful, and the beautiful light show is worth punching in and taking pictures📸.
Finally, comrades who go to Dragon Dream must go to the big circus! ! No pee in the whole process! Theatrical lighting, dance, beauty and sound effects show! Everything online! ! Super shocking! !

msg:Come to Sheraton with your children and parents
My parents wanted to stay at the Sheraton and specially booked a first-line Taihu lake view room.
Butler Xiao Tang took us from the front desk to the room and introduced us to the room and nearby attractions. We received feedback very quickly if we needed service in the room. He also helped us make an afternoon tea reservation.
There is a small children's playground in the hotel. There are not many people during the week, so the children have fun playing on the slide alone.
The super wide-angle view is great. Moon Square is also particularly beautiful at night.
The dissatisfaction was that I ordered a snack platter for afternoon tea in the lobby bar because the French fries were not there for the children. At first I thought I had made a mistake and ordered the wrong one. I asked the waiter if there were no French fries. I was finally told. The kitchen said there were no French fries today, so they used chicken nuggets instead, but they didn't inform them in advance that the French fries were out. It's a bit outrageous that the basic service was not done well.

When you stay in the hotel, you can have a panoramic view of the vastness of Taihu Lake. Looking at the endless beautiful scenery is refreshing. The scenery is even more exciting at night, as the changing lights make Taihu Lake beautiful. The surrounding Rainbow Bridge, Fisherman's Wharf and Moon Square are also popular places to visit.

The hotel's hardware is indeed magnificent and has everything you need. It is very good, but I feel that the hotel staff's service is better. The day before the arrival, someone from the hotel took the initiative to call to inquire about the arrival time, and gave priority to arranging a room on a high floor. After arriving at the store, the front desk took the initiative to tell me to give a hot spring ticket. Seeing our husband and wife with their children, they also gave an extra ticket. The housekeeper Coco was really excellent. She took the initiative to help me carry my big suitcase, sent us to the room, and sent me detailed Huzhou travel guide via WeChat, which made us have a very pleasant day in Huzhou. After returning to the room, the housekeeper Coco also thoughtfully arranged for the service staff to send fruits, mineral water and slippers, and proactively asked us if we needed anything else. It is indeed a very good service awareness and action. According to the introduction of the housekeeper, we soaked in the hot spring in the afternoon and watched the circus in the evening.

msg:The sunrise of Taihu Lake at 5:00 a.m. reveals a gleam of light, and gradually the whole sky becomes brighter! The beauty of the great rivers and mountains is beyond words.
Unexpected warmth, beauty between square inches; intelligent system equipment, relaxed space; one room, one style, one room, one world; bid farewell to the hustle and bustle, but also integrate into the prosperity.
And the beautiful environment: let your body and mind get double enjoyment; here you can watch the distant scenery and bring you spiritual relaxation for the tiredness of the day;
The five-star experience allows you to meet up with two or three partners occasionally: delicate, pure, high-end and elegant, endowing it with a unique beauty; I have thought of a hundred kinds of hotel copywriting, but none of them are as good as my own.
Being fortunate enough to enjoy this beauty comes from the Sheraton Taihu Lake. Thanks to Manager Chen in the lobby for a free upgrade to the Lake View Suite on the 16th floor. Standing on the terrace, you can have a panoramic view of the 360-degree view of Taihu Lake. The service is also equipped with the meticulous care for the guests of the old five-star hotel as always. Especially the housekeeper, Xiao Du, reminded me of the time of the light show at night, warm and caring. The sanitation of the hotel is very meticulous, clean and tidy, and the overall functions are very complete. There is a capsule coffee machine, which can evoke a good time of the day with a cup of American style.
In a word, I am lucky. I have unloaded the wind and dust along the way, and the time is just right. Stretch out and give me the comfort and safety of home. The best trip in life is to come to a strange city and live in a warm hotel. I hope all the good things and expectations can come as promised.

msg:The hotel service is very good, and there is a dedicated butler service. The room was also upgraded to a 270-degree viewing room, with large floor-to-ceiling windows and a balcony to enjoy the scenery. There is a cloakroom, bathtub, refrigerator and other facilities. You can enjoy the city night view and take a bath, and there is a small TV in front of the bathtub. It's just that the TV in the room is a bit small. It is recommended to add a large projection screen that can be put down. The lights in the room are relatively dim. There are no lights in the cloakroom and the bar at the door during the day, but there are sensor lights at night. There is a special charge for the hotel's laundry service, and there is no laundry room or dryer for self-service laundry. The most beautiful thing is the scenery. There is a viewing balcony on the 25th floor of the hotel, and there is also a tea bar overlooking the entire surrounding landscape. I enjoyed the sunset here. I used to come to Huzhou often on business trips, and I always saw this landmark building in Huzhou, the Sheraton Hotel. This time I brought my two children to vacation, and finally stayed in the hotel as I wished. The children also said that staying in the Sheraton is the best among all the hotels in this summer vacation. like. The breakfast buffet is very rich, including fruits, stir-fried vegetables, noodles, wontons, small western snacks, bread, etc. I ate a lot of pangasius. Breakfast is from 6:30 to 10:30, and the children eat so much that they save their lunch. The light show at night is very beautiful from 19:00 to 22:00. The kids had a great time at Moon Plaza.

msg:When I checked in, there were some small flaws in the room, and I couldn't completely solve it by calling the service center. Although it is not a big deal, to be honest, I was a little disappointed on the first day when I returned to Huzhou after the epidemic. Sheraton doesn't seem to be the original Sheraton anymore. The housekeeper, Chen Yanan, came to our room immediately after learning about the situation. After learning about the situation, he immediately rearranged the rooms according to our needs, and accompanied us to choose one by one with a new room card. During the period, he patiently and carefully introduced us, from the Internet to breakfast to some check-in points around, and even the specific time period of the light show. Changing to a new room, this trip seemed to press the reset button, and everything started to go smoothly. The view from the room is very good, the air conditioning is strong, and the internet speed is fast. We happily went out for dinner, and on the way back to the hotel for an evening walk, he reminded us that the light show was on. When I arrived in the room, a pot of watery fruit was placed on the desk, everything was so sweet to my heart. The next morning, we were reminded to avoid peak meal times and go to breakfast now for the best experience. After checking out, I also sent a message to look forward to the next reunion. On the return trip, I was not only impressed, but also the quality of Marriott, which has not changed. I will come back in winter and soak in hot springs. Friendly reminder: The first round of drinks in the hotel mini bar is free, and the apple juice is delicious. The toiletries are still from L'Occitane, and the herbal smell is very good. The breakfast in the restaurant is different from before. Now it is more Chinese style. In addition to the common wonton noodles, there are also freshly made pancakes and rice balls. By the way, there are also sushi hand rolls. The tofu flower is delicious, freshly squeezed juice, so much delicious that we gave up lunch because we were full. An old five-star hotel with the quality of Marriott, I will continue to choose this hotel when I come to Huzhou.

msg:I have been yearning for the "Moon Bay" in Taihu Lake, Huzhou for a long time. This time I came here with my friends for a weekend vacation and booked three lake-view twin rooms.
Thanks to all the beauties and handsome guys at the front desk of the hotel for arranging early check-in for us, and giving the birthday children a free upgrade to a lake-view family room, so that they can have enough time to prepare for outings.
Special thanks to Xiaoyou, the beauty, who personally took us to the room and explained various matters. She prepared slippers, fruits, birthday cakes and birthday gifts for us. She also provided us with a guide to Huzhou. In the evening, she reminded us to go to the Moon Square to watch the light show. Let us not miss the most beautiful scenery of this journey.
On the second day, the front desk of the hotel also prepared the children's favorite flamingo plush toys and rich children's gifts for us. The children were super happy and the most memorable birthday.
The breakfast and buffet dishes in the feast restaurant on the first floor are rich and delicious, and you can also order birthday cakes. The Chinese restaurant on the third floor has fish heads with chopped peppers, braised pork, and whitebait eggs.
The lake-view family room is spacious, with a wide view from the balcony, and a panoramic view of the 36,000 hectares of Taihu Lake. The most distinctive hot spring must be experienced, and experience the feeling of electric shock with a group of small fish.
The outdoor swimming pool of the hotel has the feeling of the infinity pool of the Sands Hotel in Singapore!
This experience far exceeded expectations. It is a good place for vacation around Shanghai, and I will definitely come again in the future.
Thanks again to the hotel staff for their support and Ctrip for their communication.

Not to mention the location of the hotel, it directly occupies the position C of the Moon Bay Resort, and his huge body can be seen from any position in the area. The hotel has luxurious facilities and has done a lot of articles on jade culture, from the huge Persian jade in the lobby to the jade used in a large area in the guest rooms.
This time, I booked through Ctrip and was upgraded to a luxury suite for free. With large 180-degree floor-to-ceiling windows, you can enjoy the sails on the Taihu Lake in the distance from the room.
The hotel service is even more considerate. After checking in, the customer service will lead the way and escort you to the room, which is very heartwarming. The hotel's breakfast is extremely rich, with a dazzling array of Chinese and Western dishes.
Very recommended hotel, very cost-effective, value for money.

msg:I have lived in the hotel for more than ten years and have never given a bad review. Maybe I had too high expectations for the advertised seven-star hotel, or I was blinded by the magnificence of the hotel lobby. The hotel rooms are really unsatisfactory: 1. The quilt covers are all broken. 2. The quality of toothpaste, toothbrush, and comb is equivalent to that of an express hotel. 3. The lights in the hotel are dim, and after the lights are turned off, the two spotlights at the head of the bed emit a dazzling blue light, which makes people unable to sleep. 4. The essential oil spa costs 888 yuan an hour, which is far more than the market price. If you don’t want a massage, you have to charge 388 yuan per person. Is this a black shop? Finally said to call 110 before giving up. 5. The direction of the TV is parallel to the bed, is it to make people tilt their heads to watch TV? The layout arrangement is unreasonable. 6. The shower room has a smell when the door is opened. The old dirt should be cleaned up, and the cracks in the sink should be ignored. 7. The large columns in the room take up too much space.
In short, the price of this hotel is inflated, and the hardware configuration really needs to be improved.

She is a very cute girl with a very good attitude. Let us add a few points to this hotel point.
In addition, the hotel gives away tickets to the hot springs and water world, and if you stay for a few nights, you will get a few days free. Even if you don’t go out, you won’t be bored in the hotel. The hotel also has its own beach, indoor and outdoor swimming pools, and an outdoor infinity pool. Unfortunately, it rained and I didn't check in.

Before check-in, the front desk of the hotel made a special call to inquire about the accommodation needs. It is recommended to choose a higher floor, so that you can see far from the height. Whether it is the dinner in the Chinese restaurant or the buffet breakfast in the western restaurant, the taste is good and it is worth a try.
The hot springs are amazing. It takes only three to five minutes to get there by free shuttle bus from the hotel. There are more than a dozen pools.
The butler, Xiaofang, was warm and caring, and asked about our itinerary. We recommended nearby places to eat, drink and have fun. It was the Dragon Boat Festival, and he sent a Dragon Boat Festival blessing text message early in the morning. He also thoughtfully sent blessings after leaving the store. With such a caring butler, it really makes people feel at home, and it is not too much to order a hundred likes.

If you live in a room facing the lake on the tenth floor, you can have a panoramic view of the lake, and the night view is even more beautiful and charming. All the hotel staff are well-trained, and the service is warm and thoughtful. The front desk housekeeper, Ms. Mona, is very caring and has a lovely smile. Room attendants deliver things quickly. The large bathtub in the room, the smart toilet, the electric curtains, and the lake-view balcony make you feel refreshed. Spend a pleasant day soaking in the hot springs and watching the night light show.

    Breakfast, seafood buffet dinner (and outdoor barbecue) are full of varieties, the eyes are not enough to see, the mouth is unwilling to stop, and I am embarrassed to go back and forth🤭.
    The tropical rainforest-like indoor hot spring makes people linger and forget to return. Although the fish spa is charged (28 yuan/person), when the little fish cleans it for you (the little fish is bigger and stronger), the numb itching The feeling is also a piece of joy🐠. The hot spring is not far from the residence, and it takes less than 10 minutes to walk, but the first-time guests are not familiar with it. The hotel specially arranged for free pick-up by battery car, which is very heartwarming 🌹!
    We went to taste the afternoon tea (258 yuan/person) at our own expense. The elegant environment and exquisite refreshments will bring you a pleasant enjoyment☕️🍰🍒.
    Thanks for the service of the hotel! Thanks to Ctrip's platform!

The lake view room has a large balcony overlooking the beautiful scenery of South Taihu Lake. Take the hotel's battery car to go to the Moon Hot Spring in the nearby villa resort.

I have always heard that the Sheraton Moon Bay is very comfortable, so I booked this place. All aspects are in line with expectations. The hygienic conditions of the rooms and the services of the staff are very good in all aspects~
The check-in was very nice and fast, especially when I met the butler Li Yuanchen who gave me travel tips when I checked in, and I was very considerate when I checked out, thank you 👍🏻

The view of the hotel is pretty good at night. You can watch the light show on the Rainbow Bridge. There are many restaurants in Fisherman’s Wharf, and there are also restaurants in the hotel~
BTW The family room has a good view, you can see the Rainbow Bridge and the lake view, and the breakfast buffet is pretty good~

The lobby of the hotel is elegant and grand, with a treasure of 28 tons - Persian jade, and Swarovski crystals on the ceiling, which seem to cost more than 20,000 yuan. Our room is located on Taihu Lake. In the room, facing the Taihu Lake directly, it is like walking on the Taihu Lake, and the mood is pleasant. There is a large balcony outside, drinking tea, chatting, so happy! I like the shower head in the bathroom very much. It is embedded in the ceiling, the water flows straight up and down, and the shower is very enjoyable.
On the day we checked in, there were quite a lot of people. Thanks to the warm reception of the service butler Xiaoyou, who led us to the room, because we live in the Emerald Building, we have to go down from the lobby to B2 and pass through the tunnel under the lake to get there. Xiaoyou also introduced the hotel and its surroundings in detail, such as places to soak in hot springs, places to eat in the hotel, etc...Because I also brought my parents and other 4 elderly people, Xiaoyou also greeted them with care, very caring!
Here, thank you very much Xiaoyou!
I hope to have another chance to stay in the hotel, it really makes people feel happy physically and mentally!

In addition to the perfect Ford design, the most moving thing is the details of the hotel's home away from home.

There is a "butler" in the store, and the warmth is delivered to the room. Besides asking about the health, there are all kinds of care. I took my little grandson there, unexpectedly, the hotel sent baby bathrobes, slippers and toothpaste and toothbrush. An added bonus of good quality fruit. There is even a surprise announcement that children under 1.2 meters can eat more than 300 buffets for free.

The lakeside room that was upgraded to the store not only satisfies the vision on the balcony, but also looks at the sailboats and cruise ships on the lake, drinks the drinks provided by the hotel's small refrigerator and tastes Qingdao wine, and feels a sense of happiness in my heart. The feeling of coming home.

The housekeeper immediately added WeChat to guide us how to go out and play. To have warmth is to be cared for. This heartwarming card of family greetings, small gestures, was touched again.

Thanks to Moon Bay for the beautiful light show, to the waiters in the cafeteria, and to the butler and the team for their dedication.

Will choose to visit again and recommend to friends.

Then I asked questions during the stay, and the butler responded quickly. A special difference between the hotel and other hotels is that there is a stereo player in the room, put a disc of violin music, sit on the sofa, and look at the lake view outside, which is also a rare feeling. The hotel has recently started to clean the outer glass. There are reminders in each room, but the cleaning staff are obviously "simple and rude". That morning we saw the cleaning staff spraying the glass directly with a hose, and the water on the balcony Follow the flow to the room and the balcony door, wet the carpet, call the customer service, the waiter "Cui Guangyu" immediately came to the balcony to clean up; we went out and returned to the room for less than 5 minutes in the afternoon, just in time to see the cleaning staff cleaning For the outer glass, this time the whole balcony was sprayed with soap and foam water, even the chairs and tables were all wet. After contacting customer service, Xiao Cui came to the balcony again to clean it up. This time, because of too much water, he also cleaned it up. After a long time, I reported this matter to the hotel that day. The hotel took it very seriously, listened to the opinions patiently, and invited us to the tea house on the 26th floor for free afternoon tea. During the few days of vacation, I was very satisfied with the hotel, and I will come again next time.

Special thanks to the housekeeper Xiao Du (Du Tonghui), for his considerate and meticulous service, and his heart. I arrived at the hotel at 9:00 am on the 29th, and quickly helped to confirm the room. I got the room card and checked in at 11:00 (normally 2-3 pm only then). It relieved the fatigue of the journey, and I am very grateful to the housekeeper and all the hotel service staff. Due to the peak travel season during the holidays, Xiao Du prepared travel references, and at the same time helped to pay attention to the flow of people for breakfast every morning, avoiding the peak of dining queues, and enjoying delicious food with ease, must be liked.
The hotel's hot springs are great, with various soup pools and different enjoyments. The hotel's dedicated tourist bus arrives in 5 minutes, and a small video was taken quietly on the road. The children are having fun in the play pool.
The hotel is very beautiful, it is a check-in point in itself, the room is large, the accommodation is comfortable, after a day of fatigue, the hot bubble bath and the night view are beautiful.
It is 15 minutes by taxi from Dragon Dream Paradise, and it is very convenient to customize the game. Of course, the hotel is enough to play handsome and take pictures all day.
Great experience. Next time drive to enjoy 😎

When we checked in, Du Tonghui, a handsome butler, came to meet us and introduced the basic environment of the hotel, dining, parking, light show, etc., and also helped to deliver the luggage to the room. I immediately felt that the service was tall and warm! Next, let’s talk about the lake view room. The room size is very honest, and the facilities are basically in line with a five-star hotel. The surprise is that you can look at the beautiful scenery of Taihu Lake when you step into the balcony, and you can feel refreshed! Finally, let’s talk about meals. The room rate includes breakfast. It’s in the lobby on the first floor at 8:30. There are many elderly and children. Fortunately, there are housekeepers queuing up in advance. Generally speaking, it is quite worth the experience of staying, enjoying the beautiful scenery, tasting food, watching the light show, and experiencing the hot springs. I recommend everyone to come to Huzhou to see the most beautiful scenery and stay at the Sheraton Hotel.

msg:The Sheraton Huzhou Moon Hotel, also known as the famous Internet celebrity "toilet ring" hotel (netizens joked that it looks like a toilet washer), has been a favorite for a long time. Now that there is no obstruction from the epidemic, I can finally see it.
The hotel butler-style service makes people feel at home. Our butler~~ Lu Junhao is a handsome guy, gentle and refined, and considerate.
I originally booked an ordinary lake-view room. After checking in, I upgraded to a supreme executive suite. The upgraded room is really luxurious, spacious and luxurious. Coupled with the thoughtful and meticulous service of the road housekeeper, the experience of staying is even more icing on the cake. It's really awesome, awesome, worthwhile trip!
Dear friends, I am not a trustee, but I strongly recommend [666][666]👍👍🎉🎉

Facilities: complete and high enough standard
Hygiene: fully meet the 5-star standard
Environment: Large and small environments can surprise people, which is one of the highlights
Service: Warm and comfortable service comes from all aspects of the hotel.
Originally we wanted to leave the hotel after lunch, but Xiao Fan in the central dining room told us that the lighting at night was very good, and encouraged us to stay. Coincidentally, a room with a suitable price was found online, so we booked a room for the day.
We expressed our hope to live in a lake view room with a better view. Xiao Fan was very enthusiastic to help us coordinate. We are very grateful to her for giving us a good experience.
The service staff at the front desk tried their best to meet our requirements when we checked in. The room is very comfortable and has a beautiful view. Li Yuanchen, the concierge, is very warm and thoughtful. He not only sent us to the room, but also provided services at any time during the entire stay, which was very touching. The warm and caring notes and the turn-down service from the room depar**ent made our night's rest more comfortable.
Through the pleasant communication with the pony manager at the front desk and Mr. Wang, I realized that the hotel training, service concept, service standard and service practice allow guests to enjoy a happy time.
I wish the hotel will continue to work hard so that more people can enjoy the beauty of Taihu Lake and the beauty of the hotel.

msg:Objectively evaluate the management level of the hotel
1. The left side of the bridge that enters the hotel is full of cars. It is difficult to meet the car. The ground is full of cars. When I want to park underground, I am told that the underground is full. I have to ask to find a parking space on the ground, so I want to go down and have a look, no Come up again, and the garage is very empty!
2. Picture 2, the welcome fruit worth 40 yuan is marked on the Ctrip order. If you see several black spots on the orange, forget it. I don’t deserve to eat a good-looking fruit for a room fee of nearly 3,000!
3. The front desk informed that there are few people going after 8:30 for breakfast, because the tour group basically finished their meal at that point, and they went downstairs at 9:00 to wait in a long queue, so they went upstairs and called the front desk at 9:30 to say that there were not so many people in line It’s too much, today it’s delayed until 11:00, and we go downstairs to have breakfast at 10 o’clock. There is a sign at the door that prohibits wearing hotel bathrobes. What is this in picture 3? Strutting around a restaurant in a bathrobe is off-putting.
4. The breakfast category is acceptable, and the quality is amazing. Are the eggs fried on one side serious? The aunts and uncles in the restaurant don’t have work badges, and they wear masks under their noses. They come to ask if they can take away the dishes before they finish eating. They are temporary workers. At 10:30, the waiter with a name tag comes to remind you that you need to eat quickly. It's time to collect food. This breakfast was really bad.
5. The smart toilet in the bathroom is faulty
6. Caiyuexuan is on the 3rd floor, the decoration is old, and the waiters are indifferent. There is no reserved information on the next table, so they say that they can’t sit. It’s ok, you can sit where you want to do. nonsense. I gave a menu and left, and a waiter didn't come to pour a glass of water for ten minutes. Later, I took a taxi and went out to eat Macau Doulao.
After leaving the store, the butler called back and said that there was a butler service, that I didn’t want it at the time, and that I didn’t answer the phone calls you made a few times. How can I answer your guest room calls when I’m not in the room? After driving for a whole day, I went back to the room at night and saw that I had turned down the bed, so I washed up and went to sleep. I didn’t care about it anymore. I didn’t even feel the five-star level in this so-called seven-star hotel. I won’t stay there again. Have a next time, very disappointed!

The unexpected surprise is to help upgrade to a suite where you can watch the sunset in the west and the sunrise in the east. You can have a panoramic view of most of Huzhou, and the location is excellent. Zhang Lili, who is in charge of the guest room, is also very attentive and enthusiastic. He not only prepared fruits and small gifts, but also asked the customer service to clean up the room in time, making people feel at home.

We were quite apprehensive before we went. It turns out that we have to experience it ourselves. Let’s talk about the room. The decoration in 2003 is indeed a bit old, but it is still worthwhile. The view is very good and the bathtub is big , The size of the room is not too big, the bedding is very soft and comfortable, the automatic curtains and the toilet are very useful, but there is no laundry basket, I don't know where to put the changed bathrobes, and the washes are all from L'Occitane, oh yes, the conditioner There is no body lotion. You can ask the housekeeper to provide it separately. I also gave you two hot spring tickets. I didn’t go to experience it this time because the time was too tight. There is also a children’s playground in the hotel. My baby is having a good time. I wake up in the morning and watch it The sunrise is beautiful, in short, it is worth a vacation trip.

msg:A notable landmark on the shore of South Taihu Lake. I have seen photos of it a long time ago. This time when I came to Huzhou, I specially booked this hotel to check in. The overall feeling is quite good, and the staff are well-trained, decent and enthusiastic. Compared with the five-star hotel I stayed in downtown Huzhou the day before, the standard of service and management is much higher. It cannot be said that the quality of domestic brands is not good, but international brands will basically not disappoint. Arrived at the store after 2:00 p.m., the lake view king bed room that we originally booked might not have been cleaned yet, the front desk staff and the on-site Ctrip butler Xiaoyou kindly upgraded us to a suite, which gave us an unexpected surprise. What I like most about the room is the oversized balcony, which is more than 20 meters long. Although you can't stay outside for too long in winter, standing outside to watch the scenery and the sunrise the next morning will give you a sense of happiness. Both the shower and bathtub are floor-to-ceiling glass facing the lake, which is also quite amazing. Xiaoyou followed us on WeChat throughout the whole process. The service was attentive and enthusiastic, and he provided a lot of help. He also saw us off at the front desk when we left, which enhanced our experience of staying this time. Thank you!

1. The decoration in the room is a bit old-fashioned, the details are not handled well, the carpet is very rustic, the overall look is not high-end, and it is a little different from the seven-star or even the better five-star
2. The breakfast is average, the environment is in the lobby, sometimes there is a draft, it is a bit cold, and the quality of the food is not high

It is conceivable that people feel that it is really too dry. The hot spring conditions are not bad. As long as you don’t go in the afternoon, there are usually not many people. There are many types of breakfast, but the taste is really average. It is recommended Change the cook.

I was thinking that I must learn from her and treat the people around me with gentleness and amiability. From welcoming fruits to improving Internet speed, everything is covered. ,Perfect! I missed her when I didn't see her the next day. Seeing the soulless look of the little girl in the lobby the next day, I just lamented that Xiaoyin's service level and attitude are unmatched! Ctrip's butler service is still very distinctive!

We stayed in the first room. The air conditioner was not working, and there was no kettle. After the confirmation of the maintenance personnel, we agreed to change the room. I contacted the service center by phone. 5 times, I went to the service once and it was still unresolved. After waiting for an hour and a half, I asked to see the hotel leader of the day, so I solved it and changed the room. When I entered the room, I found that the kettle was broken. I called the customer service center again, and I came to change it. How can the seafood buffet at night have the level of a five-star hotel! A few examples, the mutton soup is cold, the alcohol lamp is not even turned on, the steaks are so fried that even the chef can’t see them, what’s even more ridiculous is that we haven’t finished eating, and our personal belongings are still there On the table, the waiter has already cleared the table... Wait! I feel that the hotel's management and personnel training must be strengthened and I hope to improve

For meals, the buffet breakfast is better than dinner. The weather was not very good this time, and the viewing platform on the 23rd floor was not very effective.

msg:From the time of Ctrip's booking, the score is very high. After checking in, I feel that the experience is really good!
Facilities: From the hardware, it can’t be seen that it is a hotel that has been in business for 10 years. The maintenance is very good. The L’Occitane used in the room is also equipped with a direct drinking water device that is ready to drink. The kettle is also made by Xiaomi, and it can also keep warm. Really So convenient! The quality of the drinking water is also very good. The crystal chandelier in the lobby is really impressive. The only small comment is whether the parking garage can also be equipped with charging piles.

Environment: The appearance of the hotel is so beautiful, especially the night view. There is a light show after 6:00 pm, which basically lasts until 10:00 pm. Moon Square or Rainbow Bridge are the best viewing spots!

Service: Checking in coincided with a high occupancy rate. The front desk supervisor, Guan Yuanyuan, tried her best to arrange the room, and even upgraded to the lake view for free, reducing the waiting time. When I walked into the room, I found it was a small surprise for the honeymoon. I was very moved, because I happened to be celebrating my 10th wedding anniversary with my husband. My housekeeper, Xiao Yin, was very enthusiastic. I wanted to extend the room the next day, and she also actively helped with coordination and communication, which was very smooth! The concierge brothers at the door are also very polite, basically every time they go out from the door, they will say hello, which is great!
The hotel has a lot of packages. This time I chose the hot spring, which is right next to the hotel. The shuttle bus is on call. It is very convenient. In the hot spring room, there are dozens of hot spring pools, large and small, and there is also a children's water park, so you can take a bath with your baby. The best choice!

Breakfast: The buffet breakfast restaurant is very large and has many varieties. The taste of hot dishes is generally good, especially the noodles. The soft texture is paired with beef soup, which is super delicious. The quality of pastries and fruits is a little average, but overall it is still very good satisfying!
This is an evocative hotel, and it is also a warm hotel. I will take my family to stay and experience it during the winter vacation. See you in winter!

The breakfast is average, not much variety. Many weddings and conferences are held. Many shops nearby withered, not much to play. Room facilities are also general, the door cabinet can not be opened.

Although I take pictures of this Huzhou Internet celebrity landmark hotel, it is very beautiful during the day and at night, so I have to take photos.

The hotel's accommodation is quite satisfactory. Since I booked a room on Ctrip, there is also a private room butler service. Xiao Qin's service is in place and caring. She always thinks of us everywhere. For example, it's windy today, so she will send a message to tell us to add more clothes.

The hotel's buffet breakfast is quite rich and enjoyable. The Fisherman's Wharf next to the hotel is a place where all Taihu delicacies are gathered, making you drool and linger. There are also hot springs beside the hotel to soak in, there are many soup pools, it is worth taking a dip and relaxing.

Hope to have the opportunity to travel to Huzhou again next time and choose Moon Hotel again!

Looking at the Sheraton Moon Hotel, I thought that I must come and stay for one night to enjoy the unique beauty of the Taihu Lake and the Moon Hotel. This time it finally worked. Tickets booked on Ctrip, self-driving from Hangzhou to Huzhou, show the reservation information, the car can be driven directly to the hotel underground garage, no need to enter the license plate number, direct free parking. When we checked in, the waiter had a very good attitude. Annie, the special housekeeper, took us to the room, introduced the hotel facilities and services in detail, and also took the initiative to ask us to add WeChat. During the stay, you can contact her for anything. The attitude is very good, very professional. I booked a room facing the Moon Square, with large windows on both sides and a large balcony. The scenery outside the window is beautiful, and there is a light show at night. The room is big, well-equipped and very sanitary. The carpet is old, but it is very clean. The Chinese restaurant on the third floor of the hotel is also delicious. This experience was really good, and I will come again next time I have the opportunity.

It is not so obvious during the day, but you really get goosebumps at night. The toilet was also leaking. Taihu Lake is also not good-looking, yellow, yellow, gray and dirty, and the lake view room is not worth it. This hotel is all you need to stand outside to watch the light show at night.

The evaluation is very general, and I didn't go there. The takeout is basically not available. After breakfast, I quickly packed up and went home. To add, although the occupancy rate is obviously not high, the front desk will not give you a room before 3 o'clock, don't even think about upgrading, and will not go to live again next time for free

The overall service of the hotel is still very good, the rooms have exclusive butlers, and the service of Xiaoyu is satisfactory. There will be opportunities to experience again in the future.

There is a spacious open-air balcony with a panoramic view of Taihu Lake, the night view is very healing, the light show is very distinctive, and the hot spring in the villa area is also very comfortable. Finally, I like the housekeeper Xiaoyu, the little girl is very good.

A great travel experience. I drove to the Moon Hotel with my friends and stayed for one night. The room was clean and warm, and it felt like home. The surrounding environment is very good, suitable for vacation, butler Xiaoyu's service is great, recommend staying.

The room is very clean and the details are in place. The toiletries used are the big brand L'Occitane. The bathtub is also matched with an LCD screen.
The little brothers and sisters in the hotel are very warm and generous! If there is any difficulty, I will immediately come up to ask and help solve it. Our family, two adults and one child, booked a double bed. Because the child is still underage, we have a lot of discounts for us. This is very good.
The hotel environment is also very good. There are small beaches, lakes, indoor and outdoor swimming pools, and hot springs. But friends who want to go to the swimming pool, pay attention! Remember to wear a swimming cap! This tube is so strict that you won't be allowed to enter the water without a swimming cap! There are commissaries, coffee bars and restaurants nearby, but the taste of the restaurant is average. The food and beverages in the hotel are slightly less in variety and the price is slightly higher. I originally planned to go to the speedboat or motorboat, but the business hours are really weird. I can't control when it is open and where to board the boat. If the hotel is the best, I can help to investigate it, which is also convenient for tourists who come to play. Good play experience~

The breakfast is quite complete in both Chinese and Western categories. After breakfast, children can play on the beach all morning. Lunches on both days are in the Chinese restaurant on the 3rd floor. Hanging roast chicken is highly recommended. In the afternoon, I arranged a hot spring ticket from the hotel, and took the shuttle bus to the hot spring hotel. The entrance of the hot spring hotel was inconspicuous, but it was quite big to enter. It's good for kids or couples.

Anne Li Bingbing, Cindy Qin Menglu, the housekeeper of the Sheraton Hot Spring Hotel, made us feel at home. When our group (11 adults with a small baby) arrived at the hotel ahead of time, she and Anne Li Bingbing thought about what we were thinking and were anxious about what we were worried about. They immediately checked the hotel information and gave us a family room first, so that the baby could rest in peace. While we were anxiously waiting for the rest of the houses, Miss Qin did her best to take us to the 23rd floor to see the scenery. We can see the whole picture at a glance, her intentions, her warm heart, let us see the conscientious work of the hotel staff. Their deep and true enthusiasm is deeply imprinted in our hearts, and Huzhou is more beautiful because of them.

Looking out from the balcony, it happens to be Taihu Lake, and the line of sight is good. The top floor is definitely better, hahaha.

There was no time to experience the afternoon tea on the 25th floor, and there was no time to play in the swimming pool.

The breakfast is quite satisfactory, basically have. There are also many restaurants around to eat, you can choose.

The most important thing is that all the staff are very enthusiastic and will greet each other when they meet. The most important thing is the housekeeper Candy, Xiaoyu, who added WeChat in advance to introduce the hotel situation, very detailed, He also gave small gifts to my two babies, and sent us to the underground garage when we checked out. I think 100 likes is not enough to give you 😊, and the housekeeper "Xiao Qin" who served after arriving at the store was also very enthusiastic and sent it to the room.

msg:The activity packages snapped up on Ctrip are really cost-effective. In addition to breakfast, there are buffet dinners and afternoon teas, as well as tickets for hot springs ♨️. Outdoor hot springs are even better.
Let me tell you that the experience of staying this time was really twists and turns... At first, I entered the hotel gate to check the health code, but the uncle didn't know what to do. , During the check-in procedure, LG wanted to ask the person in charge of the lobby to come out and communicate about the unfriendly experience in front of him, but the tone of the other person in charge of the front desk seemed to be a blind excuse, not a customer service look at all, I feel that he is God.
However, Xiao Zhang who checked in at the front desk and the bellboy on the day were very professional, thoughtful, warm and attentive for the customer, and kept apologizing.
In the end, the whole incident was successfully resolved after our beautiful and lovely little sister ~~ Bingbing Butler took over. Bingbing butler patiently listened to the needs of customers and felt the voice of customer service... and provided customers with high-quality services in a thoughtful and thoughtful manner.
It is also compensated to upgrade to a high-rise lake view suite. It is really a beautiful landscape suite. You can watch the sunrise and night lights in the morning, and even more beautiful is to see the different phantoms of the night and day in the Moon Hotel!

msg:I have been to Moon Bay in Huzhou a few times, and every time I look at the Sheraton Hot Spring Hotel, commonly known as the "toilet cover" from a distance 😀 This time I accidentally found out that Ctrip was engaged in activities, so I immediately informed my friends to start a group purchase together This includes two nights accommodation at Sheraton, two breakfasts per day, one buffet dinner, and one hot spring, a total of 2199 super affordable packages.
After a good year, I received the hotel information, saying that staying before March 15 can help to upgrade the lake view room, so my friends met together on March 1 to go to Moon Bay in Huzhou for a vacation. The hotel service is really thoughtful. Fruits and snacks are delivered. It is indeed a seven-star hotel. The snacks are really delicious.
Upgraded the lake view room, you can watch the sunrise in the morning, and the night view of Taihu Lake in the evening is also very beautiful.
In the evening, I went to the swimming pool of the hotel, the temperature is 28 ℃, just a few of us, swimming and taking pictures in comfort. 😀😀😀
The hotel breakfast is very good, the environment is very good. The buffet dinner is rich in variety, and there is also a resident singing. You can enjoy it while eating, and really enjoy it.
The next afternoon, we all took a bath together in the hot spring.
All in all, it was a perfect getaway.

It happened that my daughter was on marriage leave and came with her on vacation.
After booking the trip, the hotel customer service called specially to ask about the needs of the check-in and help to upgrade the lake view king-size room. The view of the room at night is very beautiful. Small dim sum, as expected of a high-star hotel, the dim sum is really delicious, looking forward to tomorrow's buffet breakfast and buffet dinner! [Naughty]
The hotel lobby is magnificent, and a 28-ton treasure of the town store is placed at the entrance.
In the afternoon, I also went to the swimming pool of Le Hotel, the constant temperature was 28°C, and there were no people, so I could swim comfortably. [baby teeth] [baby teeth]
When we checked out, it was the "March 8th" Women's Day. The hotel specially prepared two L'Occitane travel suits for the two ladies, one size larger than the wash suits in the room. Thank you!
In short, this is a perfect vacation trip, that is, the surrounding tourist facilities are all under construction, and they have not been fully up yet. It is relatively deserted. It is suitable for those of us who don't like noisy environments. 😀😀😀

There are more than 20,000 strings of Swarovski crystals at the entrance. The walls and floors are all jade. The rooms are very modern. There is a TV in front of the bathtub in the glass bathroom.

What's even better is the little Ryan Xue butler in the concierge to solve all your problems. And the little sister Zhang Lingling at the front desk has a very good attitude and efficiency.

I live in 1560, the room is very large, and I can see the beautiful night view of the city at night. I compared the lake view room and I feel that it is more beautiful than the lake view room. I wanted to upgrade the lake view room. , Because the lake view room is dark at night and can't see anything, it is not as good as the city night view here. The buffet on the first floor is good, and there are two foreign handsome guys and beauties singing in the evening; the hot spring is also good, there is a lot of choice, and there are many pools; we only stayed in the hotel for the two-day package, which is very comfortable. The only regret is that the platter of meat in the Chinese restaurant is too fatty and doesn't feel worth it.

Last month, I saw 2199 yuan on Ctrip and the buffet dinner for two nights was too cost-effective. I bought it immediately. Two copies, and I bought 5 more copies after posting in the group. The hotel room is good. I like the big balcony the most. If the weather is warm, it's not too pleasant to sit on the balcony and watch the Taihu Lake and blow the wind. As soon as I entered the room, I saw the welcome words on the bed and the small animals made of towels. Then I saw the balcony and the lake, and I felt like I was in a luxury room on a luxury cruise ship. Because of the epidemic, I couldn’t take a cruise to play the world anymore, so I happened to be here. Addicted. The housekeeper Mingyue is very amiable and lovely. She helped us upgrade the deluxe lake view room, gave us fruit snacks, and always cared about what we needed for help. It feels very warm and will come again in the future.

Buffet breakfast: There are Ding Lianfang thousand sheets, dry pickled noodles, and Huzhou's special breakfasts are basically available, and the dim sum tastes very good.
Buffet dinner: not recommended, although the taste is good, but the variety is less, the price is not high.
Hot spring: In winter, it is an indoor hot spring with 25 pools. When we go there, there are very few people, and the experience will be very good. One pool for the whole family, one for 5-10 minutes, soaks in more than 10 pools, and sleeps super fast at night .

msg:"Sheraton Huzhou Hot Spring Resort Hotel" has always been affectionately called "Moon Hotel", and she has also been regarded as a local scenery. Every foreign visitor will take her to appreciate her unique shape standing in the water and dreamy night. light and shadow. Occasionally, I will invite relatives and friends to have a buffet or Japanese food. By the way, I will experience her magnificent lobby, as well as the beach and lake view of the lake in the back, which is definitely a pleasure in summer.
    This time, I was finally able to stay at the hotel, and with a novel glimpse of the inner structure, my wish for many years was fulfilled. It is worthy of being a hotel managed by an international big brand, and the entire store appearance and service are of first-class standard [strong]. The lake view room on the 11th floor where we lived has a large terrace (should be the essence) and has a wide field of vision. In the distance where the lake and sky are the same color, there is a long merchant ship (should be a shipping route), which has been rising As far as the eye can see, a vivid picture is displayed; nearby are the trails along the lake and some businesses, which are dazzling under the lights at night, and you can even hear the sound of the lake lapping the river bank, as if you are at the seaside.
    The room is not very big, but it is enough to live in. After nine years of operation, it is just at the stage of neither new nor old. The bathroom part may take up two-fifths of the space, the huge round bathtub and the texture of the sanitary ware all indicate the grade, and the jade paved floor and countertops are quite exotic (though I personally don't like dazzling a feeling of). The bed is large and comfortable, the air conditioner is powerful, the hot water is plentiful and timely, and the sound insulation is good.
    It was January, although there were not many guests in the off-season and the epidemic situation, it can be seen that the hotel still tried its best to maintain the brand image. Open for business; I was the only one to enjoy the swimming pool, and the security guard was not absent throughout the whole process; only two employees of the SPA were sticking to their posts, but they also provided service (although the level of professionalism was lower than my expectations); although the buffet dinner was only 2, 30 The dishes are still quite rich, and the small Filipino band is also performing diligently; the night light show is staged as usual, and there is no hasty ending, think about the energy consumption... Various responsible images make people feel trusting and moving[ powerful]
    It also comes with a ticket for the "Dream of Teana Dream Hot Spring" next door (it is said to be 188 yuan per person for a single purchase), enjoying the feeling of soaking in various hot springs in a botanical garden-like environment, which is really worth the money [strong]
    In a word, "Moon Hotel" did not live up to our expectations. After the stay experience, my goodwill towards this hotel has been strengthened [strong]... I hope that after the epidemic, she can welcome more guests and return to the former prosperity [nest]
    By the way, Zhang Lingling at the front desk is very enthusiastic!

msg:A good experience.
Hotel service is very good. Get off the bus and take the initiative to help carry your luggage. There is also a dedicated lady butler. We are Mingyue butler this time. They provide reference attractions and itineraries very intimately, and also help to call a car. A waitress at Caiyuexuan was great. We said we were in a hurry, so we placed an urgent order for us. The back kitchen was also great. Four dishes were available within 15 minutes! The taste is also good.
The room facilities are good. Although it was not so luxurious before the renovation, it has everything that should be there. There are welcome fruits and free drinks in the minibar. This is very good! (But next time I can have sugar-free Coke, it would be even better).
The lake view room I stayed in, the view is still very good, the view is very wide.
There is a light show in the hotel at night, and it was this grass that was planted at that time, and the scene was really good.
The room I ordered was sent to the hot spring, but because it conflicted with the light show and the meal time, I didn't go, and also because it was cold indoors.
The hotel’s evening buffet is okay, and the price/performance ratio is good after a 6.5 discount for the customers. I personally think that the variety is enough. Breakfast is okay, but it's not perfect. I think there should be a dedicated omelet and scrambled egg cook, otherwise I sometimes have to wait.

It feels good after all, so I will come back again.

The breakfast in the hotel is not only simple and not tasty; the weather was very hot when we checked in, and the room was even hotter under the glass curtain wall radiation of the hotel. The hotel could not even use central air-conditioning and provided us with an electric fan (picture 1 below). It is the first time in life to use an electric fan to cool down in a five-star hotel with a room charge of 2000+ yuan/night. This is also a record. When I talked about this with the taxi driver, it became a joke of the driver's master. The driver's master said that he has air-conditioning all seasons when he lives for more than 100 years.

You can enjoy the "toilet cover" while soaking in the hot springs and watching the moon. The scenery of the hotel is beautiful, the hotel swimming pool is also good, 1.3 to 1.5 meters, the indoor swimming pool is not very big, and the outdoor swimming pool is not open. The breakfast is good. The price is 188, little expensive. Check out is served by Mao Ziyang, very fast and good service. The waiters in the hotel were very nice and had a very happy Mid-Autumn Festival!

After chickin, he took us to learn about the history of the hotel and also sent us into the room. Knowing that it was my birthday, the room was specially decorated and it was beautiful! After communicating with Manager Bai, the dinner was booked in the Chinese restaurant of the hotel. Manager Bai specially arranged the location and arranged the seats. I was also moved by the birthday cake and the ceremony of the band. Thank you very much Huzhou Sheraton Hotel and Manager Bai Ground service, will stay again next time!

The hotel’s breakfast is also very good, especially seafood porridge, I ate several bowls.
The hotel’s hot springs and swimming pools are also remarkable, I look forward to going again next time

🔔Service: Does not meet the standards of a five-star hotel. The children entered the kids club for an entire hour without being present. They just sprayed disinfectant and did not tell them. We thought the children were allergic to mosquito bites. The situation became more serious when they returned home that night. The hotel thought it was feedback to the hotel lobby manager. I have no responsibility at all. Disappointed, unlike the service standards of five-star hotels, the feedback from guests is impersonal. Negative Ratings!

Arrive at the Sheraton Hot Spring Hotel at 10 o’clock in the morning and check in soon. The room needs to go down to the B2 floor by escalator and then take the elevator to the check-in floor. The room is not big. The lake view room we booked is still amazing. Yes, the room soundproofing is very good, recently because the quality of sleep is not very good, but the hotel slept very soundly last night, hahaha...It is also worth mentioning that all the staff in the hotel are super caring and the service is really good 💗! The taste, service and environment of the Japanese food eaten at the hotel for dinner are very good! Check out the front desk gave a small gift, every time I was very lucky! 💗💗💗
The two-day itinerary is full, including visits to the Dragon Dream Water Park, self-driving zoo, ginkgo rafting, and a joyous trip back home! 🤗🤗🤗

The hotel's butler, Yin Jielin, was very warm and thoughtful, helping us arrange a room with a good view, and gave two children souvenirs, the children are also very happy. The hotel's environmental facilities are good, there is a children's area on the 22nd floor, although it is not very big, the ocean ball is enough for the child to have fun for an afternoon. There is also an indoor and outdoor swimming pool, an indoor gym, and a hot spring ticket. The breakfast variety is expected to be richer. The overall hotel still gives me a very good impression. The child said that he will come next time 😃

The indoor swimming pool is slightly small and the outdoor swimming pool is closed too early (18:00). The hotel's service is still very good. It is commendable. The slightly worse hygiene is because there are obvious hair residues in the bathtub and on the basin. In general, the price of 2599 does not fully reflect the value.

msg:It was the only platinum seven-star hotel in China, and brought my old mother to stay. The hotel is located on the shore of South Taihu Lake, 16.9 kilometers away from Huzhou Station, and it's about 57 yuan from Didi. It is relatively close to Taihu Ancient Town and Huzhou Film and Television City. Booked a lake-view double room, the room area is not too big, and the maintenance of the facilities is fair. There is a large balcony with floor-to-ceiling windows for light and excellent views. The lake view room wakes up in the morning and sees the morning glow and sunrise on the east side, and it feels good. The night view is beautiful! Just a few minutes walk from the hotel to Moon Plaza, the perfect light show is awesome! The breakfast is quite satisfactory and not bad. I would like to give a suggestion to the buddies who want to book a room. If the reservation does not include breakfast, Hua 188 feels a bit unworthy the next day. Parents take a lot of children in summer, the sound insulation is not very good, and the children in the next room are a bit noisy.

There are many lake-view restaurants near the hotel, as well as a crowded square, which is very lively in the evening. But after passing a small bridge, you will arrive at a quiet world. The courtyard of the hotel is in order, and non-residents are not allowed to enter. Definitely good value for money!
Besides the facilities in the room, the large balcony of the lake view room is particularly bright and spacious! The BOSE CD player in the room is equipped with two CDs of old songs that reveal the age; the bathtub is equipped with a separate TV; the wash basin is equipped with a tap for direct drinking; the toilet has an automatic flushing function. In short, the sense of technology and practicality are both considered.
The software is also very satisfied, the bathroom is a full set of L’Occitane toiletries, and two bottles of 5100 drinking water per room.
The breakfast is quite rich and the taste is delicious.
For entertainment, the hotel provides indoor and outdoor swimming pools. But the gym is not too big and the equipment is relatively small.

The staff in the hotel lobby would take the initiative to say hello to us. The sliding door next to the revolving door of the hotel It's a bit heavy. When the staff saw us coming in from a long distance, they would rush to the door to pull the door for us! After asking if the room type can be upgraded, the check-in staff at the front desk enthusiastically helped us upgrade to the lake view room, which made us ecstatic! The room booked contains a complimentary hot spring ticket. After playing for a day, you can go for a bath if you are tired at night. That is, the hot spring is not in the hotel, and there is a battery car to pick you up! It only takes 2-3 minutes! The design of the hotel is magnificent, tall and tall, you must swipe your card to go to the room and take the elevator, and the security is very good! The lake view room is facing Taihu Lake, and it has double balconies! The view outside the balcony is wide and refreshing! The room facilities are good, there is a special dressing table, and the toiletries are from L’Occitane! There is a small TV in front of the bathtub. Children enjoy watching TV while soaking in the bathtub! The hotel’s outdoor swimming pool is boundless, visually close to Taihu Lake! Beautiful scenery! The breakfast is quite satisfactory, with both Chinese and Western styles! Fruits are very rich! And there is a waiter to take the seat to avoid the embarrassment of waiting next to others! The meal time until 10:30 is very suitable for our family to sleep in! The lights outside the hotel at night are dazzling, and the night view is super beautiful! In short, it was a very enjoyable experience! Two small suggestions are mentioned: 1. Put a storage basket in the bathroom, so that you can put used bath towels, towels and bathrobes; 2. Whether there is welcome fruit or drinks, increase the check-in checkup! Thank you

Regardless of the size of the room or the service of the scenery, there is nothing to say, even if it is the 17th birthday, cakes and fruit snacks are provided for check-in on the 18th! The bed was also comfortable. The only pity was that there were too many self-service people at night. The hotel package I bought also included 4 hot spring tickets. There was a special car to go to the hot springs. The bathing place was also thoughtfully prepared with a dehydration machine. There are waiters for clothes and bags throughout the whole process, so anyone can deal with any problems directly. The children are having fun and the adults are also having fun! 👍🏻 Recommended to stay! Finally, I left a thank you note in the room, and I will continue to choose to stay next time!

msg:這是一次很愉快的旅行，尤其是最後一站：入住湖州喜來登酒店。由城市景觀房免費升級到湖景房，是意外的驚喜。房間設施齊全，入住舒適，價值感滿滿的。早餐品種很多，乾淨清爽，多是美味佳餚，加上環境幽雅，用餐是享受。
特別值得一提的是“美拍”，無論是接待員還是攝影師，熱情，周到，讓人舒心。攝影師攝影技藝確實是“大師”級別。美照給這次旅行畫下了完美的句號。

msg:這次到湖州，其實就是為了這個酒店來的，説實話，酒店的設施有些老舊，畢竟是開業十幾年的老酒店了，硬件談不上多好，水平一般。加上增送的温泉和拍照，綜合來説，符合這個段位的水平吧。
這家酒店，也許從硬件上比不過其他超五，但是環境簡直是美呆了，客房的陽台能直麪太湖，那種水天一色的風光很讓人沉醉，尤其這個季節，徐徐的涼風，能和三五好友在陽台上賞着美景，喝着茶，簡直是享受。
酒店的自助早餐也值得一提，煙燻三文魚，幹拌麪，還是有幾道讓我小驚艷了一下的。
最後，着重感謝一下前台管家小桑，入住時主動為我升級成了臨湖的房型，而且給我發了湖州的遊玩指南，並且增送了我迷你吧的飲料，非常貼心，為我提供了一個完美的行程。

再嘮叨一下，我來之前，也看了很多評論，很多説迷你吧不免費，啤酒58一罐太貴了。我想説，這種級別的酒店，你衹要開口，一般情況，管家都會增送你的，人家開店，肯定是能省就省，你不開口問怨的誰，出門在外，多問一句沒壞處。

總之，一次滿意的行程，值得再來。

msg:老公説這是七星級酒店，我們也沒少住五星級酒店，所以我一直沒當回事。結果這次來住還真的是超出預期了。首先，房間的面積真的大，還有陽台。非常大的陽台，滿眼的太湖，像海一樣大，無邊無際。其次就是別墅區的温泉，真的值得體驗，傍晚時分，一輪明月映於湖上，和酒店主體相映成趣，温泉水，玫瑰花瓣，茉莉花香……幸福就是這個樣子吧。酒店周圍也有飯館和水果市場，我們在市場買了枇杷桃子，一邊泡温泉，一邊品枇杷。太滋潤了！早餐可圈可點，衹有你吃不過來的，沒有早餐沒有的，哈！酒店還給了一個新鋭拍照，本來我們都沒抱什麼希望，想着就瞎拍拍吧。沒想到化粧小姐妹和攝影師都很好。完全超出預期！酒店的服務也很好，很耐心，的確是喜來登國際管理集團的樣子。唯一要注意的就是，酒店到温泉的電車管理有點混亂，我們來回都等的有點久。希望能把這一點點瑕疵改掉。晚上温泉回來還在販賣機買了瓶啤酒，好喝又好玩，小資情調拉滿！晚上在陽台上一瓶小啤酒，真的真的推薦大家試試！總之就是很好的一次體驗，因為後面的行程太緊，要不肯定再多住兩天！

msg:總結：會推諉，扯皮，欺騙的酒店，不會再來也不推薦別人來。

起因：入住刷了停車碼當天進出都沒問題，第二天退房後出門系統出錯要交費150元，保安説要回酒店重新掃碼。當時由於後面堵了幾輛車無法後退和保安溝通先出門再掉頭進來，不肯非要我們原路從對面車道倒車回酒店，而且出入口是急下坡。由於後車貼的緊衹能打死方向盤倒車蹭到了馬路牙子，保安全程不幫忙。回酒店找前台説昨天已掃碼不用重新掃。
訴求：酒店系統出錯導致無法出門+保安處理不當導致事故，酒店應當對碰擦承擔部分責任。

然後就是酒店的各種推諉了，去看了監控説我車速太快沒有掃到車牌，我説都顯示付款150元了，怎麼可能沒掃到車牌，啞口無言。然後經理説要不報警，我的意思本身一點小事故大家協商一下處理，找警察也是協商，沒必要。由於急着趕路就先加了經理微信。之後經理電話過來咬死説系統是自動的，酒店沒任何過錯和責任。

本身事情不大衹是想和酒店溝通一下，沒想到碰到各種推諉，扯皮，欺騙（騙我説是因為我開太快沒有掃到車牌導致）。衹能説由小見大，一個品牌的崩塌往往始於點滴口碑的失去。

一來湖州都沒看別的酒店，直接選了這家，自駕

遇上避開換個小姐姐辦理，其他姑娘都很熱情

晚上玩好回來路過前台問她要個東西她讓我問管

轉了，可以説我聯繫管家送上去或者直接給我，
這裏不得不誇一下管家Aaron,體貼周到，笑臉
迎人，一加微信就給我發了湖州旅遊攻略，要的
東西微他很快就送房間了，入了夜很壯觀，六點
到九點實時變換的燈光秀還是很值得看的!

首先，複式房間的設計獨具匠心，充滿了現代感與奢華氣息。從進門的那一刻起，我就被房間內的精緻裝飾所吸引。寬敞的客廳與陽台，既保證了空間的獨立性，又顯得寬敞明亮。落地窗設計讓室內光線充足，視野開闊，給人一種賓至如歸的感覺。
在設施方面，喜來登酒店同樣不落人後。房間內的傢俱、電器均採用知名品牌，品質上乘，保證了居住的舒適度。床鋪柔軟舒適，讓人一夜好眠；浴室設施完善，配備了高品質的洗漱用品，讓人在疲憊的旅途中也能享受到貼心的呵護。
服務方面，湖州喜來登酒店更是讓人讚不絕口。從入住開始就有專屬管家Geng一路陪同到房間，並一一介紹每層的佈局情況，並耐心解答我提出的各種問題，還主動為我提供了一系列實用的旅行建議。這種無微不至的關懷讓我感受到了家的温暖。
總的來説，湖州喜來登複式房間給我留下了非常美好的印象。無論是從設計、設施、服務。我相信，無論是商務出差還是休閑度假，這裏都能為您提供一次難忘的住宿體驗。

缺點：空調是中央空調控制，自己可以調節範圍不大。定的湖景房，但是湖景一般，湖水不乾淨沒啥好看的，還不如定對面看看夜景。地下車庫比較小，關鍵是充電樁衹有特斯拉的，其他都要自己出去找充電的地方，雖然不遠，但是還要專門開進開出，還有額外停車費，比較麻煩。室內泳池有點小。

總體來説，體驗還是可以的，但是因為過年期間，人比較多，所以沒有感受到太多的服務。早飯快9點去的，排隊了一小會兒。吃完了出來發現已經排長龍了，建議高峯期還是早點去比較好。

msg:第一次帶父母從上海自駕出行，選擇了距離適中的湖州，就一定要住地標建築“馬桶圈”。整體入住體驗非常好，父母很滿意，房間設施比較新，空調聲音很小，每天打掃。對於新手女司機來説，地下停車場停車略微有些難度，好在有值班人員指導，服務態度很親切。早餐高峯人很多，一般在八點之前去吃會有空位，品種比較豐富，還不錯。距離太湖古鎮和馬戲團駕車十幾分鍾，很方便下次還會入住。

在入住的前兩天，客服Jamie來電確認行程有無變動以及預計到店時間，並添加了微信，發了附近景點的旅遊攻略給我，知道我們是全家出行的，還幫我們申請酒店的温泉券。
辦理入住時管家Leo全程陪同，辦完入住後還幫我們把行李送入房間，還添加了微信，在我們向他反映陽台沒有座椅時，他馬上安排服務員送來，還在晚上送來水果點心以表歉意。
酒店裡衞生很乾凈，入住時房間內的空調就已經開好了，房間裏很暖和很舒服。缺點就是酒店WiFi有點慢。不過這次總體上來講都非常滿意，在此要向客服Jamie和酒店管家Leo人員以及其他服務人員表示感謝。（23年12月29日入住，23年12月31日離店，906房間客人）

因此當我們到達酒店早於酒店方常規的入住時間近兩小時也能快速辦好入住。
我們這次是入住多維景觀套房，房間和洗浴衞生間也比較大，有一個圓型觀景深浴缸，可以邊泡邊觀景，特別是在跨年夜邊喝紅酒邊泡浴同時又能觀賞跨年煙花，感覺特別棒。此套房還有一個超大的觀景陽台，既可看太湖美景又能看月亮湖廣場以及彩虹橋和山景。
酒店的衞生、服務態度都非常好，特別是管家LEO在入住時就全程陪同，辦完入住還幫我們把行李送入房間，並添加微信，以便在我們入住時有什麼需要幫助可以及時對應。在之後我們進出酒店時都會微笑問好，詢問有什麼需要幫助的，在我們向他反映前一天深夜水温不是很好時，馬上聯繫工程確認原因並反饋給我們，還在下午送來水果點心以表歉意。這樣賓至如歸的貼心服務，讓我們在這次跨年度假期間非常愉快。在此要向管家LEO和其他服務人員表示感謝。
另外要提一點建議，酒店的早餐品種多樣豐富，唯一的不足就是用餐位置和場所有些狹窄擁擠，雖説入住人多，我覺得可以更合理的分時段安排，而不是為了讓客人能儘快的進餐而降低用餐環境的舒適度。

一共入住了三晚，訂的圓浴景觀房，前台給升級了湖景房，可以看到漁人碼頭和太湖景色，很棒。
浴缸很大，小寶寶可以直接當泳池了，酒店的室內泳池衹有一個，沒有寶寶池，小童樂園屬實有點小，酒店有一片蠻大的草坪和沙灘，天氣好的時候適合寶寶放電。
房間有送温泉，但因為寶寶還比較小，沒有去體驗，室內温泉應該也很適合冬天放鬆。
這次入住，比起酒店硬件設施，印象深刻的是貼心的服務，尤其是從本次入住的全程管家文馨，服務周到，笑容親和，對寶寶也很有愛心，對我們的一些特殊要求響應也很快，大大提升了本次入住體驗。
酒店離龍之夢動物園和冰雪世界都很近，漁人碼頭步行可至，來湖州住一住還是很值得的

msg:設施：按這個級別的酒店橫向對比，設施真的很拉胯。老式吹風機像拖拉機一樣響，但半天吹不幹頭髮；梳子堪比快捷酒店；房間陳設都舊舊的；酒水吧幾乎沒温度；針線包要打電話才要才送來（這應該是房間標配）；沒有洗衣袋；最最最誇張的是門鎖是壞的。
衞生：桌子、衣架、陽台窗把手等很多地方都是黏糊糊的，馬桶圈還有尿漬。至於浴室頭髮忽略不計了。
環境：外觀高端大氣，走進大堂感覺並不寬敞，行政酒廊也很小。
服務：最最最拉胯的是服務。帶小孩游泳完泳，裹着浴袍準備會房間洗澡，不曾想門鎖刷卡失靈，打前台電話五六分鐘以後工作人員慢悠悠的走來了，結果她也打不開，説不是卡的問題，是門鎖壞了。於是她在微信羣和同事報備此事，可是這是孩子已經濕漉漉的在門口站了十來分鐘。最後還是我自己打電話到前台，過了一會前台工作人員過來查看原因，誰是系統問題。最終，在孩子凍了快20分鐘的時候門終於打開了。在我的一再抱怨下，工作人員説會送一杯薑湯過來，可是等來的是一杯紅糖水。當晚孩子就開始流鼻涕，第二天早上咳嗽。直到退房在無人關心過此時，我很生氣，至少需要關心過問一下。於是我辦理退房手續是像他們提出意見，希望他們能定期檢查和維護設備設施，提高服務。至此，工作人員才説“最晚交接的同事説過這個事情，實在抱歉了，送您一瓶紅酒吧”。我是缺那瓶紅酒嗎？缺的是主動關懷的態度，而不是我不提你也不提。再説説用餐，中餐廳外包的，服務跟不上，味道湊合；海鮮小火鍋自助餐358隨不算貴，但是品類真的很少很少；就連早餐的豆漿都是兑水的，真的大無語。第一頓早餐入場時，報了房號，被告知這個房號有人進去用餐了，可事實我們就一家三口，並沒有其它人先進去。被盤問了半天才讓我們進去。至於為麼我也不清楚，也許是工作人員劃錯了，也許是負責驗房號的工作人員疏忽，放人進去沒有核對房卡，被人冒用了。總之是我住過眾多酒店中非常查的體一次體驗。不會再來，也不會推薦朋友來。

msg:基礎設施差，服務很奇葩！強烈不推薦的酒店。2000一晚，實在不值這個價！
1，停車非常不便捷，門口站着的禮賓會讓你自己找位置停。轉一圈沒有，才會聯繫車庫讓停下去。
2，入住告知衹有5樓和2樓房間，這種説辭誰信呢。他們還問是從哪個渠道訂得，攜程就這麼不被待見唄，雖然本人是攜程的黑鑽等級。最後給安排到了21樓。
3，房間設施很舊，被水泡爛的門，壞掉的撥不通的電話，狹窄得攤不開的衣帽間。Wi-Fi也沒有信號，都搜不到Marriott這個信號名字，解釋説因為樓層高，這讓其他20層以上Wi-Fi信號還很好的酒店情何以堪啊….最後衹能連接電信公眾的 izhejiang Wi-Fi。
4，如果你需要多幾瓶水，送來的會是純水樂這個牌子，而不是房間裏有的5100。真挺會節省成本的。還有被別人用掉一大半的護髮素，被當成新的擺在淋浴間。
5，這個房型很奇怪，衹有一張椅子，其他人想坐，要麼坐地上，要麼臟衣服坐床上。理解樓層越高越窄，這種類型的樓也不是第一次住，廣州四季，上海金茂，都是越往上越窄，但沒見過減配成這樣的。最後要了2張椅子，孩子們總算能坐下了。
6，早餐9:30大排長隊。等了大概20分鐘，服務員準備帶入座。離譜的事情發生了，説那個角落的桌子，讓兩個孩子坐沙發上，可以嗎。就是我圖片拍的同類型桌子，一張單人桌卻要讓兩個孩子擠在一側，而且還是靠牆的角落，2個盤子都沒辦法並排放下！太奇葩！
總結：不會再來住的酒店，可惜了這麼一個地標建築，合同到期趕緊換運營酒店吧。

月亮酒店聲名在外，各種美圖好評風迷網絡，藉著到湖州之機，決定打卡一下這家南太湖之濱的珍珠，感覺特別不虛此行
在此，我感受到了：優雅的月亮酒店，美麗的湖光山色，完善的設施，舒適的温泉，以及最重要的——熱情關懷備至的服務。
這是我第一次來，但絕不會是我最後一次來
最後，希望湖州太湖喜來登酒店吸引更多的四海賓朋入住

在攜程上預訂了廣角超大太湖湖景雙床房，到酒店的時候是下午3點半，前台告知我定的房間還沒有打掃完畢，同房型的也沒有空房間。前台的陳經理馬上給我升級了套房，甄選湖景套房，面積更大，視野更好，還額外贈送了第二天的早餐。不得不説，這個服務是相當的滿意啊👍！房間在16樓正中間的位置，雙陽台的，站在陽台上，太湖美景一覽無餘。
喜來登的早餐也是如網評的那樣豐盛，中西式都有，還有壽司🍣，衹可惜，胃就那麼大，吃不了，下次來湖州還是選定這家酒店！

總的來説，湖州喜來登酒店以其優越的地理位置、高品質的服務和豐富的休閑設施，為遊客們提供了一個完美的度假體驗。如果你計劃來湖州旅遊，不妨選擇入住喜來登酒店，相信你也會和我一樣，愛上這裏的一切。

想起攜程訂房時看到的照片，打開一看，發現照片上是有沙發的，和酒店反應了以後，酒店説可以換到另一棟樓，但需要等，衹能等了一個小時到下午3點半才換好。後面的房間還可以，但衞浴也不是很舒適。
這個酒店住一次，下次再來湖州休假就不會住這家了。

msg:這次給爸媽定的房間，首先很感謝酒店給升級的房間，但是爸媽回來告訴我説房間就在電梯邊上，實在太吵了，老年人睡眠不好，想要求換個房間，但是酒店的回覆是給個耳塞？！可能還是爸媽太好説話了，今天退了房才告訴我，住過很多五星酒店，兩千多的體驗感就是一晚上睡不着，平時幾乎不評論，但是聽到還是很氣憤，本來是想讓他們五一出來玩住的舒舒服服的，結果搞成這樣，體驗感特別差

特別感謝酒店工作人員的服務，尤其是管家Leo；
周邊還有一些值得遊玩的景點值得一去。

msg:衹能用希望越大失望越大來形容這次的住宿吧
1、提前二週預訂的房型付款1500多，升級了一個湖景房間，不含早餐，入住當天無意打開攜程一看價格1400+含早餐！瞬間讓人覺得對顧客的欺騙！而且入住的房間門衹要有同樓層的人關門開門，我們房間的門必定會響，再次讓我感覺很不好！
2、反應情況後，酒店工作人員態度倒是挺好的，表示會贈送一個早餐，同時説會更換房間，這一刻我覺得態度不錯，也釋然了
3、晚上帶着娃回房間，一身疲憊，進房間刷卡，燈不亮了，找到客服，5分鐘人來了，告訴我，進房間後要去床頭開燈，什麼？什麼？那插卡的意義是什麼？無法理解啊！這就不説了，拎着行李來到更換的房間，再次讓整個人陷入無語🙄換了個更小的房型！花着大房型的錢，住着小房子，這就是太湖喜來登的服務！💔💔💔
入住請三思！🩶🩶
本次忘了拍照，但是可以去核實，房型從1201換到1703🖤🖤🖤🖤

設施：一是沒能細緻入微從客人需要着想，諾大酒店就沒提供個擦鞋機，一般的飯店都有的設定。也許需要的客人不多，但有沒有是飯店的水平。比如浴缸大家很少用，但衹有不入流的旅館才僅有淋雨噴頭。再就是房間裏馬桶自動潔身器噴頭不出水（0952房間），頂置淋浴花灑個別噴嘴堵塞，水流四射。這些設施設備的日常檢維修不做嗎？
這是我住過的喜來登體驗感最差的酒店，如同山寨版。

另外，温泉倒是很不錯，有十多個池子，人也不算多，洗浴處很乾凈。早飯的種類和時常都滿意。

不過湖州的旅遊業非常奇怪，一到八點多，附近的館子全不接生意，連個水果攤都沒有。不在酒店吃的話，估計衹能吃門口的德克士

msg:客觀評價，這麼多年來出行入住的最差五星酒店之一。本來是衝著湖州排名第一，攜程評分4.8的推薦去的，實際體驗真的很一般，大概衹有3-4星左右的水準。
1、前台。到達酒店時間是晚上8點，辦理入住的前台妹妹在看手機，又很靦腆，走到跟前還是我主動問能否辦理入住，餐廳在哪裡，幾點吃早餐。就很累。在入住之前衹有一個房間確認電話，也沒有提前管家服務，辦理過程中一個管家比較熱情，替前台妹妹回答了我的大部分問題，還比較欣慰。和她説想兩間房儘量近一些，是挺近的，一間7樓一間9樓。
2、中餐廳。三樓的中餐廳我是真的服了，本酒店絕對的敗筆。因為放好行李吃飯已經接近8點20分了，門口月光廣場餐廳8點停業，衹能就在酒店餐廳吃飯，餐廳一份千島湖魚頭680元，一份牛肉250元，一份青菜78元，是的，最便宜的蔬菜是78元起步，好吧，價格高點也沒什麼，上菜以後把我們家裡人都驚呆了，一份200+的老鴨湯端上來一股濃濃的鴨騷味，其實就是沒洗乾淨。其他菜也都是路邊小飯店的水準，沒有擺盤，沒有裝飾，就是大排檔！是的！人均300-400的大排檔！服務員各個很忙的樣子，沒有餐後水果，沒有鮮榨果汁，衹能喝25元一小罐的百事可樂！誰去誰知道！四個人最後吃了1300，服務費還有120，這中餐廳和搶劫無異。
3.房間。房間設施整體還好，但我比較敏感，晚上有空調外機的聲音，低頻，咚咚咚的，很難受。
綜合評價，徒有其表，敗絮其中，2300一晚不會再來。

服務：那也是很貼心的從入住到離開全程在線。入住當天酒店的管家Leo宋聰來加微信，住店的時候有問題都幫助解決，離店我們有東西忘記了也飛快幫助我們解決了問題，服務全程在線。
交通：滬渝高速下來很快就到了，邊上就是太湖，很不錯的位置。本次旅途唯一一點不算太滿意的大概還是地下停車場立體車位比較多，停車稍微有點頭疼🤦♀️

   缺點也許接待的人比較多吧，房間設施使用沒有教，都是我微信一點點問的，歡迎水果也是後來管家説了後才有（一個白芯火龍果還有一個橙子一個青蘋果），所以服務給了個滿意。
晚上出去太湖古鎮不遠，打的9塊錢，不過回酒店比較麻煩，那邊比較堵，很多車不送，價格起碼25以上。
唯一可惜的是沒吃到那酒店的打卡棒冰。

酒店的服務還是相當令人滿意的，前台小姐姐很漂亮，嗲嗲的，還送了我兩份早餐券；管家Leo宋聰很nice，回覆問題相當及時，入住的時候送我們到房間，介紹了酒店設施，走的時候也熱情的送我們到電梯。
另外酒店晚上的燈光值得一看。走到酒店對面的碼頭邊，找一家當地菜館，坐在太湖邊，吃着太湖三白，看着炫目的燈光，如果天氣足夠涼爽的話，還是很愜意的。

msg:訂的雙卧聯通房，和父母一起入住，怎知這個房型衹有三樓的頂頭兩個房間，第一個房間看出去就是一個頂篷，換了另一邊，衹能説勉強好一些，可以看到一點點湖和游泳池。湖景的加錢也不能換。內部設施麼，可以看出來當年確實花了大價錢的，可是畢竟時間久了，審美過時了。總之，這個房型謹慎預訂，總體預期也別高，旺季價格需要回避一下，就還能接受。

服務：客房經理陳燁楠先生，服務貼心周到，不僅推薦周邊景點，還主動提醒我們各個景點的演出時間，全程管家式服務，讓我們有一種賓至如歸的感覺！
環境：坐落在太湖之上，晚上的燈光夜景實在是太美了！
設施：酒店贈送的月亮灣温泉♨️真的很棒👍有酒店車輛接送，室外18個特色温泉小池，還有孩子玩得水上樂園。晚上8點多去的，泡在温泉池中，周邊吹着陣陣夏風，抬頭看着天上的星星，讓人的整個身心都得以徹底的放鬆😌
室內泳池不是恆温的，有點出乎我的意料。雖然是夏天，但下水的時候還是感覺有點涼嗖嗖的😮💨

另外提一點小建議：要是健身房通風系統再好一些，一樓自助餐廳再大一點，餐食再豐富一些，就完美了。

自助餐還是挺好的，晚上有駐唱。菜品挺多的，味道不錯，大人小孩都吃的很開心。
