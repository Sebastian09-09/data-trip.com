We will definitely go back!

msg:This stay was not only for the tenth anniversary of our marriage, but also for the Children's Day with our children. The whole experience was very good. The suite was large and clean, and the hot spring was as distinctive as ever.
This time we also experienced the hotel's barbecue. The outdoor barbecue was very pleasant, and it seemed like we were having dinner on the beach in Sanya.
The service of the housekeeper Luna was the highlight of this trip. She arranged the room layout for the anniversary, took us to the room after check-in, arranged red wine thoughtfully, and sent it to the barbecue place. Although there were some minor incidents when picking up the cake in the evening, Luna and the duty manager were able to solve the problem quickly. That night, the cleaning staff was also arranged to help lay the sofa bed. The next day, they thoughtfully helped us extend the check-out time to 2 o'clock, so that we had time to soak in the hot spring again after exercise.
Every link of the whole process was arranged clearly, and Luna will have to arrange it next time.
We came once in June 22, and I was particularly impressed by the hotel's hardware at that time, but this time the housekeeper's service refreshed my impression.
A great experience, I will come again next time.

msg:This time I upgraded to a private bath room! I saw many posts saying that it is not necessary to book a private bath, but I think it is much better than an ordinary room! If you arrive late at night, you can soak in the room directly after dinner. There are more people in the pool on the mountain at night! You can tell the front desk in advance that the private bath in the room is disinfected, and an aunt will come to disinfect it in person, which is very reassuring. The mountain is very quiet at night. Play some music, eat some fruits, drink some wine, soak in the private bath, look at the hillside, and enjoy the unique time. It's very comfortable! ! ! 
I think the hotel service is ok. There will be a butler to add WeChat in advance. Special thanks to Luna for taking care of it, 24 hours on call! It may not be the peak season, and it is also recommended that everyone travel off-peak, and the experience will be much better. The room will prepare children's things in advance. This time I found two cute bunny towels and handwritten cards, which is very considerate! 
The key is that I think the food is OK! The Chinese restaurant for dinner, the Sichuan cuisine is excellent, a little expensive but delicious üòã The whole family is very satisfied with the casserole tofu! To be honest, the breakfast buffet is the best I've ever had!
After eating, I strolled up the mountain to soak in the hot springs. There were surprisingly few people on Saturday morning. It is recommended to take a hot spring bath in the morning, which is better than in the evening! Many pools were empty, and I went to enjoy a big private hot spring again. After soaking, I sat next to it and drank two cups of free brown sugar ginger tea. Occasionally, there was a gentle spring breeze, which was comfortable!
There is also a children's playground and a sports field, and you can climb the mountain! I didn't have time to experience it, I will come again next time!
Eat well, stay well, soak well, release stress, and naturally relax. It's a good place to relax and relieve stress!
Pay attention to the group room voucher at any time. I think it's expensive but worth it!

There are two Chinese and Western restaurants for breakfast. The Western restaurant will have more people and the taste will be better
The barbecue set meal reserved for dinner was just developed by the hotel. The waiters are still a little unskilled. They all need to grill it themselves. There is a good a**osphere with resident singing

The housekeeper Vivian answered all questions, paid attention to our needs, and helped us make reservations. Thumbs up!
The dinner in the Western restaurant was a little bit bad, which was the only drawback. Maybe they were afraid that the restaurant would be crowded during the holidays, so pizza and hamburgers were only available for room service.

I got it this time at the Mid-Levels Hotel. The perfect experience started from the day before check-in. The hotel housekeeper Alice implemented all the arrangements that needed to be booked in advance. The hotel is indeed located on the hillside as its name suggests. It is very private and can only be entered with the reservation information. Alice waited at the front desk and accompanied the whole process to the room. There is no need to say much about the hotel's hardware facilities. What impressed me most was that all the service staff I met, including Alice, greeted the guests very sincerely and took the initiative to arrange the needs of each customer carefully, not just to deal with it. The hotel started with a high-end business positioning group, but it transformed to the parent-child group with the highest market demand in time. You can see that the original Tai Chi course room was changed to a children's pottery classroom, and a nearby farm park package was also given. Both children and parents had a happy holiday. 12 hot springs in the mountains, overlooking the mountains and forests, and the beautiful sunset is in full view. Feel the warmth and relax!

msg:For the May Day trip, I chose the Bay Half Mountain Hot Spring Resort Hotel in Miyun, Beijing. I had a lot of fun with my children~
Facilities: Five-star facilities, every detail is very good, the environment is high and elegant, the hotel prepared various DIYs for our mothers who took their children out for a walk, and the children were very happy~
Hygiene: There is no need to exaggerate the hygiene~
Environment: The hotel has hot springs, halfway up the mountain, with a total of more than a dozen hot spring pools, with a beautiful environment. While taking a bath, you can enjoy the beautiful scenery deep in the mountains~ After breakfast the next day, I chose to climb the mountain and climb to the top of the mountain to see the panoramic view of Miyun, which is particularly stress-relieving~
Service: What I want to say most is the service. I have been to the Seven-Star Burj Al Arab Hotel in Dubai. I think the most expensive thing is not the hotel environment, but the service. I also have a room butler for Free Dubai. The Half Mountain Hotel also has a room butler. My butler is Xiao Cheng. The service is particularly good, the arrangements are well-organized, and he responds to every request. He is very warm. I have recommended it to my friends and asked them to find Xiao Cheng to bring their children~

They were very serious and the car was shiny after washing. It received five-star praise and the experience was upgraded. Amy, the hotel housekeeper, helped me check in and always reminded me to pay attention to sun protection. I also asked about the reservation of the hotel's hot springs and entertainment facilities. If I was hungry after swimming or soaking in the hot springs, I could order a meal. There was a pillow menu in the room. After checking out, I gave my child an ice cream that I had been longing for. It was delicious and the experience was great. It was suitable for a family vacation. We soaked in the hot springs, played badminton and basketball. The sports facilities were all good. If I had to make a request, it would be that there could be more breakfast styles. I felt that there were not enough varieties. In my personal opinion, it was actually very good.

Overall, it is good and I will go there again if I have the chance.

msg:Take the high-speed rail from Beijing Chaoyang Station to Miyun Station, and get off the high-speed rail and take a taxi in half an hour. It is close to Yunfoshan Ski Resort. Overall, the hotel service staff are very enthusiastic. The best impression is the restaurant and room service staff. The hotel facilities are complete, there is a children's club, you can swim, take a hot spring bath, exercise, play ball, and the breakfast is very rich. But there are also areas that need improvement: 
1. Because it is a holiday, there is a long queue of cars waiting to register at the hotel gate. The driver was unwilling to wait, so I took the child to get off the car at the gate and asked the hotel registration staff at the gate if it was far to the lobby. They said it was quite far and they would call the hotel shuttle to pick us up. After thanking them, I waited next to the hotel exit. During this time, many guests who drove complained that registration was too troublesome, resulting in a long queue at the gate. As a result, the registration staff probably forgot to call the shuttle to pick up because they were too busy. Seeing that the cars were getting more and more, I had to go over and ask the registration staff when the shuttle would come. The other party used the intercom to ask the shuttle to pick us up, and did not apologize to me. Fortunately, the shuttle bus driver was very enthusiastic and hurried to help with the luggage. When my daughter insisted on sitting in the last row, the driver stopped the car and put the child in the last row.
2. All service items in the hotel need to be booked, and the experience is very poor. The hotel's starting point may be diversion, fearing that there will be too many people during the festival and causing a bad experience. In my opinion, this is completely from the hotel's standpoint. This is very unfriendly to the elderly who cannot use mobile phones, and it also adds an extra burden to the guests. Wanting to play but not being able to make an appoin**ent will make the guests experience very bad. In fact, you only need to tell the guests the opening hours. If there is no place or there are too many people, the guests will naturally choose to go at other times, rather than the bad experience of not being able to play without an appoin**ent. The child wanted to play badminton, but we didn't make an appoin**ent that day, so we made an appoin**ent for basketball üèÄ. When we arrived at the scene, even if there were vacancies on the badminton court, we were told that we couldn't play without an appoin**ent. Fortunately, we made an appoin**ent for basketball and were allowed to play. The next morning, the child wanted to play badminton, but didn't want to make an appoin**ent for the next day. After going there, he said that he didn't make an appoin**ent. I checked and found that the appoin**ent was wrong, but the appoin**ent was full that day, so he was still not allowed to play.
3. Children in the children's club must register their room number and child information. I didn't understand the original intention of the hotel to require registration. Is it to give the staff something to do? In fact, the people who go to play are all guests of the hotel. In fact, the staff only need to pay attention to the safety of the children and answer the guests' inquiries from time to time. There is no need to register at all.
4. It may be that there are many people on holidays, the dinner takes a long time to serve, and there are not many dishes to choose from. You need to queue for breakfast. Although the dishes are rich, the long waiting time will reduce the experience.

Finally, the overall feeling is that there is still a certain psychological gap between the service experience and the room price.

We traveled off-peak before the holiday and enjoyed the private trea**ent of the Mid-mountain Hot Spring, Children's Park and the back mountain (with a view of Miyun Reservoir). The next day, the child suddenly felt uncomfortable in the stomach during breakfast. Helen also specially asked the restaurant to prepare millet porridge and steamed dumplings and helped us to check out late. Before leaving, the child said that he was very satisfied and would come again next year. Before leaving, he drew a picture on the hotel note as a souvenir.

First of all, the hardware facilities are good, the rooms are clean and tidy, the hot springs are very unique, and the sports venues and fitness equipment are complete. in addition. The humanistic service is very thoughtful. The hotel staff are proactive and can solve any questions at any time. They are considerate and enthusiastic.
The most noteworthy thing is that there is a dedicated person to guide you in the breakfast room, which many five-star hotels cannot do. For in-store entertainment reservations, we can go according to our own schedule, which not only controls the flow of people, but also makes the play experience high.
The butler-style service allows us to communicate with the hotel at any time. This time the butler is Alice, who is warm and attentive from beginning to end, making us feel at home.
All in all, our family of three was very satisfied with this stay. If we prepare a bottle of clothing deodorizing spray in the room, it would really be comparable to the hotel service in Japan! Highly recommended!

The parent-child room with coupons plus the private bath booked separately, the old and the young had their own playground.

The hotel also has many recreational activities. For adults, there is a 3-5km hiking trail, as well as a gym, tennis court, and badminton court. There are even more activities for children, such as an outdoor skating rink, an indoor swimming pool, a large children's playground, and the Spring Festival. Theme temple fair. The day before check-in, Cecilia, the bay housekeeper, took the initiative to contact her. She was very considerate. If you have any questions or needs, you can ask her. She responded quickly.

msg:1. Let me reiterate:
The breakfast was really good. There was nothing wrong with it. All kinds of food were delicious. I didn't think about the unpalatable food or the reduction of food intake as mentioned in various reviews.
2. The playground is underground, and there is plenty for children to play in. As for the low temperature, it may be just right for children, but it may be a bit cold for the adults waiting.
3. The free drinks in the room are sufficient. If there are not enough, you can ask for more, and they will be delivered quickly. The only drawback is that the quilt is too thick. It is recommended to change it to a thinner one. The sleep quality may be high, especially the pillow.
4. The swimming pool is great. My child stayed in it for two days without leaving. Especially the 30-degree heated pool is the most beautiful for children who can‚Äôt swim and love to play in water.
5. Mid-level hot springs are not an in-depth experience because children feel hot. felt regret.
6. I didn‚Äôt have time to go to the gym.
7. The complimentary salt steaming and Bianstone steaming are pretty good. Except for checking out and going home in a sweat.

When there are many people, there are two Chinese and Western restaurants. You can choose from Hong Kong-style morning tea and a coffee shop that combines Chinese and Western styles. It is more user-friendly. I stayed for two nights. I tried the restaurant for both lunch and dinner, and the food was good. Children loved the Western-style simple meals. There were pasta, pizza, and burgers. The Chinese-style meals tasted very good. They were all outstanding. The SPA was very good.
I was very impressed with the hotel management. Very warm and welcoming. For example, a service guy in the hot spring area was humorous and enthusiastic. He just passed by us and saw that we were hesitating whether indoors or outdoors in the hot spring area. He gave my family a very clear introduction and provided reasonable reservations according to the habits of the elderly. ** Hot spring time. The people in the hotel are very friendly. The kittens on Kindness Mountain are also caring and loving.
It is also worth mentioning that the housekeeper Ada has clearly understood my needs and the characteristics of the guests (I am traveling with an old person and a small child) since she added me on WeChat. She prepared the room for us in advance to avoid waiting to come and provide more mineral springs for the elderly. The water is convenient for taking medicine. The facilities and equipment of the hotel were clearly introduced. Because I was very tired from skiing, they helped me make a reservation for the spa in advance. They sent me text messages of concern every morning and night. They were really nice and responsible. They also went to the lobby to see us off when we left. All in all, it was very heartwarming.
Already looking forward to my next visit

The hotel has complete facilities, including hot springs, swimming pools, gyms, gymnasiums, and skating rinks in winter. It‚Äôs just that going to hot springs in winter means passing outside, which requires a little courage. After arriving at the soup pool, the scenery is beautiful, and you can experience the soup pools with different medicinal effects named after the 12 zodiac animals.
The service is very attentive. Before arriving at the store, the housekeeper Amy will contact you and send you notes.

All in all, I was very satisfied with this trip. I will take my family there again during the winter vacation.

The service staff at the hot spring are very attentive and will ask you to dry off the water before getting out of the hot spring and then put on clothes to avoid catching a cold.
There are many parent-child activities organized by the hotel. Teacher Xiaoxiong is very patient. Thumbs upüëç.
Amy, the housekeeper who received us, was very enthusiastic, introducing the hotel's infrastructure, helping to book activities, etc.
In short, Beijing‚Äôs top ranking of hot spring hotels is not false.

In addition, Halen, the hotel housekeeper, contacted us in advance before checking in and was very knowledgeable and thoughtful about all the issues raised. The hotel lobby is very grand, especially the superstar curtains that I have seen for the first time. The swimming pool, gym, including the sports center are all first-class. The hot spring is a little far away from the guest rooms. It is a little cold in winter, but it doesn't matter when you soak in the hot spring. There are a total of twelve and a half outdoor hot springs and one enclosed indoor hot spring. I went there in two days of stay, and I basically managed not to share the same pool with others. The hotel's breakfast is also very rich. There are two restaurants to choose from. We have a children's meal for 99 for two adults and one child. The price is also reasonable. The only slight drawback was that the food at the Chinese restaurant in the evening was not as good as expected. I ordered two six-pound fish head set meals, which together probably only weighed six or seven pounds, which was not comparable to the seven-pound fish head I ordered later in Huaxi.

I arrived at the hotel at around 6pm, and there was no space in the underground garage. I could only park in Parking Lot 2, which is a 5-minute walk from the lobby. Helen was already waiting for us in the lobby, guided us to check in, sent us to the room, introduced the room facilities, and when she saw there were children, she took the initiative to contact the staff to help us put together beds. The child had a birthday during the trip, and the hotel sent greeting cards and cakes. The rooms are in the south wing of the hotel, with hot springs, swimming, fitness, badminton, skating, and alumite salt steaming. The restaurant is in the south wing and you need to go through the front desk. The hot spring has a large indoor pool that can accommodate more than a dozen people. You can ask the staff for the locker key to put your clothes. There are more than a dozen small pools, which are semi-open and can accommodate 5-6 people. They have independent changing rooms. Clothes can only be placed in the rest area. The small sun in some small pools was broken and was not repaired in time. There are free brown sugar water and sour plum soup near the hot spring pool, and the staff will send bathrobes and towels to the hot spring pool. The swimming pool is indoors, allowing swimming and water massage. The locker room has a sauna and dryer. There is a gym where you can play irons and there is also a chess and card room. Badminton and skating are in another area, badminton is 15/piece, others are free. The Western restaurant is in the lobby. Breakfast is 198 per person, which is normal for a five-star hotel. The fruits and desserts are delicious. The Chinese restaurant is on the 3rd floor and is a bit expensive. The distance to eat nearby is 4 kilometers away, and takeaway is available. The overall feeling of the hotel is very comfortable, and the staff are warm and hospitable, especially the housekeeper Helen.

In order to avoid the peak period, the Bianstone Room and Himalayan Salt Steaming Room became private rooms for my husband and me when we went to the gym. The golf service guy said that because there are so few people, there is no need to limit the one-hour time limit. What impressed me most here was the considerateness of all the service staff. From the security guy when I entered the gate to my one-to-one butler AMY, I really couldn't fault anything. The hardware of the five-star hotel is very good. I don‚Äôt think there is any need to praise this point. It should be like this after spending money. However, not every hotel can do it because the service staff makes the guests so comfortable. This shows that the hotel has made a big difference here. Kung fu. The happiness brought by this kind of person is completely unmindful even if the hardware is a little lacking.
A little suggestion: The Banshan Hot Spring is very good, and the hot drinks are particularly delicious, but it would be better if you could add a little plain water of your choice, so that people with high blood sugar would not be afraid. After all, most of the people who bathe in the hot spring are adults and are not interested in sugar. Still very concerned.
In addition, it would be better if there are shower caps and shoehorns in the room!
All in all, I really like this place and will definitely come back next time!

Facilities: The bathroom is separated from wet and dry, and a bathtub is provided. The bathroom facilities are a bit old. I don't know if it is a problem with the sewer. I feel that the sound is more obvious when the water is flushed upstairs or next door in the middle of the night. The corridor is soft-covered and the sound insulation is pretty good.

Environment: The courtyard has been designed, and it feels like it is because of autumn that the lotus flowers in the water pavilion are not blooming well. There is a small hillside suitable for hiking. According to friends, there is a certain distance that is not easy to walk and is challenging.

Service: There is a one-to-one butler Vivian who can ask for your needs in advance and will also inform you of precautions.

Breakfast: The overall level of the kitchen is good, the Chinese breakfast is excellent, and the French bread tastes good, recommended!

The hot spring is halfway up the mountain and half outdoor, which is very unique. The park is quiet and tidy, with beautiful architectural style. It has an indoor playground, a small outdoor plantation, and a shallow mountain climb, making it suitable for the whole family.
In particular, I want to mention that the hotel's service is very good. From the reception staff to the cleaning staff, they are all very enthusiastic and meticulous.
Especially the housekeeper Xiao Han, who contacted us the night before and received us as soon as possible on the day of arrival to introduce various aspects of the hotel. The service during our stay was also patient, meticulous and very thoughtful!

The day before the trip, the housekeeper Ding Liang contacted the housekeeper by phone to inform him about the advance reservation for the parent-child program. He also sent a mini program reservation code. You can make reservations according to your own time plan. It is very convenient. You can make a reservation for the hot spring in advance before checking in or having a room number. , it is really convenient for my wife. This detail is really considerate. The housekeeper learned that we need to bring two children and specifically asked if we would like to share beds. If we need to share them in advance before check-in, he repeatedly told me that we would share the beds. The location will be as high as the bed, which makes me feel at ease. We originally planned to arrive at the hotel around 3 o'clock, but we arrived at 2:30. Unexpectedly, everything was already arranged and we could check in directly. Special slippers for children are also prepared.
The butler Ding Liang provides one-on-one service throughout the entire process and will answer any questions in a timely manner. The service is really considerate;
The waiters were very enthusiastic. The child bumped his leg while climbing up. The hotel immediately sent iodine and band-aid. In order to make us less time-stressed, the check-out was originally postponed to 2 o'clock, but was extended for another hour. ~
After checking out, if you want to play in the hot springs and entertainment facilities, you can still continue playing~~
Overall, I am very satisfied with everything. It would be nice if the food could be served in a variety of styles. My favorite is the buffet, but there is no dinner. A little disappointed
The big hot spring pool is under renovation recently, so I can only experience the small hot spring pool with the 12 zodiac signs. It‚Äôs a bit regretful. Next time I go, I want to experience the private hot spring room~

The surrounding environment of the hotel is quite good, the weather in Miyun is relatively blue, and it is very comfortable to stay among the green water and green mountains. The hotel is relatively clean overall, and the service is OK. The butler at the reception is Amy. She called me before I went but I didn't receive it. She is very nice and attentive. She will remind you in time on every aspect and provide a lot of help and services. Most of the other service staff in the hotel will smile and say hello when they see the guests, but not all. The delivery of things to the guest room was on time, which was good. As for the hot springs, the service staff are very enthusiastic and have a good service attitude. Except for the housekeeper, the service attitude in the hot spring area is the best. However, the hotel does not have enough control over the hot springs. There will be guests, especially those with children, eating fruits and biscuits in the hot spring pool. There are fewer pools, but there are more guests. The experience depends on luck and whether it is a weekend. I only ate at the Chinese restaurant for hotel meals. It didn‚Äôt taste bad and the ingredients were pretty good. The price was a bit expensive, but most hotels at the same price have this price, so it‚Äôs considered normal. Breakfast is quite satisfactory, the stewed wontons are okay, the dough is chewy and not shabby, and the vegetables, salads and fruits are relatively fresh. The breakfast environment is almost as noisy as the dinner environment. If you want to have breakfast quietly, don't even think about it. It's a domestic environment. I experienced sound therapy. The room was next to a child's craft house and the sound insulation was not good. The whole process was filled with the sounds of children shouting and adults chatting. Sound therapy is basically a completely silent environment, but the location of the room was not good enough to create an unpleasant experience. generally. In the end, Amy helped us with late check-out and gave me a cake. The service was highly rated. But the overall experience is average, and the main hot springs are not very good. Guangtu Hotel is definitely not here. So I don‚Äôt have many thoughts about coming back.

msg:The room is neat and clean, and is thoughtfully equipped with children's bathrobes, slippers, etc., which is more suitable for family accommodation. Outside Shadian, it is surrounded by mountains, shaded by green trees, gurgling water, and has a pleasant scenery. When it rains, waterfalls cascade down the cliffs and splash in the streams at the foot of the mountains; when the weather is fine, tourists go for an outing and travel through the forest trails. The large balcony in the room is even more unique. It is very comfortable to sit on the bamboo chairs on the balcony, enjoy the cool breeze, look at the mountain view, eat fruits and drink drinks. The hot spring is located on the top of the mountain. The pools are arranged according to the twelve zodiac animals. They are semi-open and can be enjoyed while enjoying the view and bathing. The hotel housekeeper Xiao Han was even more enthusiastic and cheerful, which made us quickly understand the hotel's service items and promptly solved some of our individual needs, making us truly feel at home!

msg:A temporary outing in Beijing, just in time for Sahuan'er before the children start school; because it says check-in at 15:00, so I went to the Miyun Reservoir Dam to check in first, arrived at the store around 13:00, and checked in very smoothly , This is very good. The direct result is that we have all experienced the twelve zodiac hot springs in Banshan Hot Springs. A large number of people arrived and successfully avoided the peak, which improved the experience of the entire stay. The second biggest advantage of the hotel is the provision of morning and afternoon tea. You don‚Äôt need to get up early, and you can successfully avoid the peak meal times; the third advantage is that although the price is a little expensive, the mini bar in the room is free, bottled water is provided unlimited, and the reserved private soup room does not limit the amount of water. There is no hidden consumption at all, which is what I personally prefer; the fourth is soft power, the service staff of the hotel are very enthusiastic, patient, and respond quickly;
After talking about the advantages, let's talk about the disadvantages:
1. There are too many mosquitoes, and the whole family is not spared;
2. The hotel is built on the mountainside, and the height difference caused the floors of the north and south buildings to be a bit confusing. It was really confusing for the first time;
3. The hotel did not have a charging pile for the tram that I drove this trip. This suggestion should be improved, after all, new energy is becoming more and more popular;

The housekeeper Luna contacted me very early and gave various warm reminders, which made the check-in easy and enjoyable. The housekeeper also gave me red wine for celebrating my birthday. I would like to say that grateful! I especially like the mountain climbing experience in the back mountain. Although it is very hot, you can overlook the whole mountain when you reach Uranus. The joy of climbing to the top comes naturally. It is a very good stay experience. I will come again when the autumn is cooler.

Needless to say, hot springs! Even though it is summer, it feels great! The elevator is in place, and after soaking in the second floor is the swimming pool, which is basically a private soup...one family has one soup pool!
Mini bar, free for the first time! But one little suggestion...is it possible to have sugary coke
Meals: The breakfast is relatively rich, both Chinese and Western, and the fruits are fresh! For lunch and dinner, we enjoyed the Chinese restaurant and the Western restaurant respectively... Personally, I think the Chinese restaurant is very good except for the low cost performance! Taste good especially not salty! The old man felt good after eating it!
Sports: I didn't climb the mountain this time üòì 40¬∞, I was in the water all the time... The swimming pool is absolutely praised üëçüèª, the water temperature is very friendly to children and the elderly when winter comes! The water quality is also very good! Great pitch!

I have eaten both Chinese and Western restaurants, and the taste and ingredients are considered good. Except that there is no sea, it is comparable to hotels in Sanya. Different seasons are worth experiencing. The housekeeper, Luna, is caring, enthusiastic, and thoughtful, praise.

msg:Before I checked in, the butler contacted me and added WeChat. Since I went there for the first time, I had a lot of questions. She answered them one by one and sent me the hotel menu. The service of the exclusive butler is very good. I was taken aback when I checked in. There were 4 counters open and many people checked in at 3 o'clock. We happened to arrive at the hotel at that time. It was also the first time I saw the counter in the corner, and the service was very good. The first impression was that it was good except for being chaotic. The butler took us to the room and introduced it. Because we were going to climb the mountain, we put down our things and went out. She thoughtfully prepared water for us to quench our thirst when we went down the mountain. The mountain is just behind the hotel, it is very close, and it is easy to climb up. The scenery is very good, which is a plus point for the hotel. According to the introduction, this hotel was used in 2017. The last time I went to Yanqi Hotel was 14 years ago, but I think that hotel has better furnishings. The bed and pillows of this hotel are okay, but the sanitation makes me not very satisfied. The ground at the entrance feels like there is a layer of soil, and the bathtub is a bit unclear. We have a soup pool alone, and it is very good to clean in front of the guests. I suggest that the hotel sell disposable brush heads and brush holders for guests to choose, or you can choose shared ones for free, or it is better to use one-off brush heads. Bathing is very comfortable and relieves the fatigue of the day. I chose a Chinese restaurant for both dinner and breakfast. The dinner was mediocre. The Geleshan spicy chicken I ordered had no taste. It was all boiled asparagus soup and I ate half a bowl of rice. My husband‚Äôs half fish head pancake he said was not next to the Miyun Reservoir. The restaurant is so fresh, but it's ok. The morning tea was opened for breakfast because there were too many people. This is very good, and there are many varieties to choose from. Although the edges of the pot stickers are a bit dry and hard due to heat preservation, they are still delicious. Even better if you can't eat pork. I want to go again in autumn, hoping to improve. By the way, I heard some guests say that the hotel is like a maze. Fortunately, I know the way.

The first day was light rain and the second day was sunny. The two different experiences are very good. There is also a children's playground and constant temperature swimming for babies.

msg:The hotel has been in the favorites for a long time, and this time the child's birthday is scheduled here. Just like in other reviews, every hotel guest will be assigned an exclusive butler. Our butler is Ivy. Although they are all contacted by WeChat, her services are provided in a very timely manner. She will remind us in time to order restaurants and sweat steaming , and then made an appoin**ent for us directly, knowing the child's birthday, and asked the room attendant to arrange it for the child, and gave the child a small cake üéÇ Any needs during the stay at the hotel would be resolved in a timely manner. Not only the butler, every service staff in the hotel can provide services in a very timely manner with a warm and friendly attitudeü•∞
‚ô®Ô∏èThe hot springs correspond to the zodiac. There are a total of 12 hot springs. They are open until 11 o'clock at night. Swimming and steaming are until 10 o'clock in the evening. We went to the hot springs before 11 o'clock on Saturday morning. There are not many people, so we changed to three hot springs The pool is our own, absolutely private soup to enjoy [Proud] But the more people there are at night, it is understandable that bathing in the evening feels more comfortable and relaxes the body and mind so that you can sleep better~ We chose to go swimming in the afternoon, the water temperature is about 28 degrees , and very comfortableüôÉ Yes, the long cotton vests in each room are really thoughtful~
üç¥The restaurant in the hotel tastes good, so choose with confidence. If you order food in the room, the western food is served until 12 o'clock at night, and the Chinese food is until 9 o'clock in the eveningüçõ
üíÜ At 8:00 p.m., the housekeeper ivy helped to make an appoin**ent for steaming. In the hotel health center, the first floor is the spa, and B1 is the steaming room. There are two types. I chose the salt steaming room because the respiratory tract is uncomfortable. It is said that the salt steaming room It can be relieved. The big sister Meizi, the waiter in the steam room, also praised me. She knew that my throat was uncomfortable. Before leaving, she ran to get me a Luo Han Guo and told me to go back and soak in water to drink [Áà±ÂøÉ]
‚õ∞Ô∏èYou can also climb mountains in the hotel, there are also small vegetable gardens, little squirrels, and little rabbitsüê∞It's also great to take a stroll if you have nothing to do [laughing]
üöøThe bath and skin care products are all L‚ÄôOccitane, take away the unopened ones, and I asked for a set from the housekeeper Ivy on the day before I left, haha, it‚Äôs very convenient to take on business trips [Tongue out]
I will definitely come again, and next time I will ask some friends to come togetherüë´

First of all, I would like to thank the housekeeper, Nancy, for her meticulous introduction and warm service, and for solving my various problems in a timely manner. Thank you for meeting me. If you observe carefully, you can find more scenery of the film. The winter is a little bit Hokkaido, and the beauty comes from our perspective. The semi-open hot spring feels more comfortable, especially when there are few people in the morning and evening, the sunset is beautiful but there are many people, and there is hot ginger tea to keep out the cold; the hotel can climb mountains, swim, basketball, badminton, table tennis, and there is a children's playground with comprehensive facilities , Note that reservations are required, the swimming pool is very warm, and the jacuzzi is warmer. Anyway, the two-day schedule is full. The food is rich in breakfast, the food in the middle restaurant is delicious, and there is a free minibar. Suggestion: The hiking trails are lit at night to increase the sense of security and the scenery, which is convenient for watching the sunrise on the top of the mountain in the morning; the big rocks can be set up for rock climbing. This time it is a spontaneous evaluation, which can give a reference to those who want to go, but I hope that I can get preferential trea**ent from experts next time, haha!

msg:The online celebrity shop has been booked long in advance. The appoin**ent is from Sunday to Monday. I feel that there will be fewer people. The price must be a bit good to enjoy. The housekeeper Ada contacted me one day in advance, added WeChat, and informed me of the project details and QR codes that need to be reserved. I asked in advance at noon that day, and I checked in at one o'clock. Ada was waiting at the front desk, and then took me all the way to the room, and introduced the locations of various venues along the way. The room is relatively spacious. The shower room, toilet and bathtub are all separated. My favorite is the smart toilet seat, which won't get cold in winter. The bath products are all from L'Occitane, even the small soap for washing hands. The eight kinds of beverages and small biscuits in the refrigerator are free, as well as hanging ear coffee and tea bags. There are many kinds of pillows, you can choose what you like. One room can bring 1, 2, or 3 children to live together. As long as they can stay, they are free. This is very good, but breakfast has to be paid. After resting in the room for a while, we made an appoin**ent for the half-life soup pool at 4-6 o‚Äôclock. We directly changed into swimsuits and bathrobes and went there. We went out from the door next to the lobby and took the elevator up the mountain. There were 12 small pools arranged in random order according to the twelve zodiac signs. Fortunately, there were no people. Too many, we started looking for either very hot or someone, and finally found an empty pool with moderate water temperature in the last room, which is still my pig zodiac sign. There are hot brown sugar ginger water and sour plum soup along the road. Bath towels can also be changed by the staff at any time. We also caught up with the temperature measurement to ensure that the temperature will not be too low. The scenery outside the hot spring is beautiful, and it is also the biggest highlight of the hotel. Unfortunately, the weather was not very good that day, and there were no leaves and flowers in early spring. Salt steaming should be done after the hot spring is over, and an appoin**ent with the housekeeper is required. Men and women are separated, and only four men and four women can be received per hour. The person who received me was Meizi, who was very enthusiastic. He introduced the precautions in detail on the way to lead us in, poured hot mangosteen water for me in time, folded a small cap with a towel for me, and took pictures for me, very kind. I went to the gym to have a look. The room is reserved, water and towels are available, and the rowing machine is very good. By the way, there was a muddy rain the night before we went, and the staff Liu Guochun and Chen Xuqiang helped us clean the car, which was a pleasant surprise. Mineral water and hot water in the building can be found almost everywhere, so you don‚Äôt need to take water from the house to go to various venues. If you go to the children's playground from the lobby on the first floor, you will find that the first floor has suddenly changed to the fifth floor in a certain elevator. If you go down to the children's playground, many people will faint here. Before leaving, he would ask us about our experience satisfaction, and we can feel the seriousness and sincerity of all the staff.

msg:The hotel that planted grass last year is finally here this year! I directly bought the "Flying Hot Mom" package, and I sincerely recommend it here!
Ada, the exclusive butler, added WeChat one day in advance, sent detailed reminders and activity arrangements, and helped to make appoin**ents for SPA and steaming (we gave up the two children's activities, otherwise the butler will also help make reservations, which is super worry-free) . What's even better is that they kindly allowed us to check in as early as 12 o'clock. It's really not too friendly to families with children! Thank you so much üôèüèª
The guest room is in the north wing, western restaurant (the package includes western-style dinner), breakfast, soup pool, health center (SPA, steam), swimming pool, fitness center (the stadium, gymnasium, although they are outside the building, they are also north-facing), hiking trails (except The Chinese restaurant and children's playground are on the south wing), all are on the north wing, super convenient! !
As soon as I entered the door, I saw the meditation arrangement on the bed. I would like to thank Mr. Chen from the room depar**ent. Seeing that we have children, he specially sent six bottles of water. I forgot to bring a disposable bathtub cover and asked the staff to get it Two, a few more packs of bath salts were given, and water, soft drinks and snacks were delivered early the next morning. It was really too warm! ‚ù§Ô∏è
Children's slippers, wash clothes, bathrobes, cotton vests, and snacks are perfect for parents and children! There is a TV in the bathtub, children can watch and play while soaking, and they don‚Äôt want to come out, hehe üõÅ
The cotton vests and crocs prepared by the open-air hot springs are heart-warming at a glance. This is not a common operation in other hot spring hotels. It is really considerate! The cotton mop is of good quality, and the bedding is very comfortable. There are seven or eight kinds of pillows to choose from, such as buckwheat, latex, memory foam, tea, lavender...you can ask the room depar**ent to deliver according to your preferences. This is why we have stayed in so many hotels. It's the first time I experienced it, I don't know what to say except üëçüèª
The beverages and snacks in the refrigerator are all üÜì. Although there is no capsule coffee machine, it does not affect itüòÜ
The toiletries are L'Occitane, there is a dressing table at the entrance, the bathroom is an electronic curtain, the balcony is manual, and the ipad console. There is a meal delivery service, Chinese and Western meals, not many choices, and the price is reasonable (we ordered Yangzhou fried rice, it looks like ¬•68, but there are two big ones and one small one are not finished ü§£ The taste is also good, remember to order if you are heavy Seasoning), 15% service charge will be added, and payment will not be charged when you arrive at the room to scan the code.
Remember to wear the padded vest in the closet when you go to the hot springs. You need to walk in the open air for a while. There is an indoor big hot spring (the bottom is Mercury, which is also the end of the hiking trail). The semi-outdoor small soup designed by Zodiac, the environment is very private! No one can open the door to enter at will. We chose "rabbit soup" (in order to meet the scene, it is actually a ginger soup pond), the water temperature is 40 degrees, and you can enjoy the mountain view while soaking, so comfortable! Each small soup house has its own bathroom, and there is no need to go out to find it. Our family of three contracted a fast-falling here for an afternoon, which is no different from "private soup", hahaha! And the point is, the soup pool is unlimited! !
The official account can reserve various hotel facilities at any time. Each room has one hour of leisure time on the playground. Basketball, table tennis, and badminton can be selected from three options. Going to play ball üè∏Ô∏è, I will enjoy aromatherapy alone, an hour of relaxing experience, very freeing (sorry to my technician here, I forgot your nameü•π...Thank you very much).
Dinner is a Western-style light meal, and the Sea, Land and Air Super Burger is really delicious! The children's pasta is full of aroma when served, and the fruit on the fruit plate must be said to be really high quality! We have stayed in many star hotels, and we are also engaged in related industries. To be honest, the catering in the bay is really amazing! Speaking of which, let's just mention the breakfast buffet, it's very rich! The quality of the dishes is very high, and the croissants are all freshly baked, and the craftsmanship is very wonderful (I usually bake as a hobby, so I can tell the depth of it with one bite üòç)! The pancakes don't have to wait long, the taste is very üâëÔ∏è, the sushi is freshly made, there are several kinds, not just small rolls that fool things. The salmon is also fresh, the bacon is not dry, there are various kinds of stir-fried vegetables, not wilted or rotten, freshly cooked pasta is not the kind of half an hour wait for two bites, the fruit is sweet and fresh ~ the overall feeling is that it is fast to replenish vegetables, there are many choices, and the dishes are not bad Fool, very serious and worthy of a star!
After dinner, the father and son went to the Children's Paradise again, and the old mother flew solo again. It took about an hour to steam. There were two parts, the Bianstone board and the Himalayan salt crystal room. It was very refreshing and comfortable! The receptionist should be regarded as an aunt. Aunt Meizi, from leading the seat to explaining, reminding and serving, replenished Luo Han Guo water in time and explained the general knowledge of health preservation. The whole process was very comfortable! thanks thanks üíê
The children's playground is much better than the simple playgrounds that are only suitable for young children in most hotels! We have come to play for several hours in two days, and we can also take care of the baby. When the children leave, they will never forget and claim to come again. Not to mention, the unlimited children's playground, including the soup pool, is also the advantage of the bay. It's all worth brushing again!
On the day of check-out, we experienced the swimming pool and hiking trails. The swimming pool is not big, and the water temperature is really not high, but it is certain that it meets the standard. There are also two children's pools, which are very clean, and the lifeguards are always online. The back mountain is named after the stars, and it is not difficult to climb. It feels very fulfilling to walk around before leaving the hotel.
Finally, I would like to say that we encountered a small accident during our stay at the hotel. The child broke his hand while playing. The manager on duty at the playground immediately called the butler. Ada and the male assistant manager in the lobby (sorry, I forgot to ask for my nameüò≠) took it quickly Disinfection supplies came to deal with it, and ice cream was sent twice to appease. I asked the children about their wounds every day, and sent medical supplies at any time. Some people care about their children, and I am afraid that every parent feels the warmest and happiest in their hearts. one thing ü•∞
I really want to thank Haiwan, thank Ada, thank the assistant manager in the lobby, thank the duty manager of the stadium, and thank all the service staff! I sincerely recommend everyone to come to the Gulf, and we will come again. This post is not flattering or flattering, it is all from the bottom of my heart! A happy weekend, a happy holiday, and a happy new year begins at the bay~üíãüíãüíã

The service is responsive to every request. The housekeeper, Ms. Echo, is warm and thoughtful, and thinks what the guests think. She sends greetings every morning and evening. When my daughter encounters discomfort once a month, Ms. Echo sent sanitary products in time and thoughtfully.

The room is clean and tidy, the area is large, and the service is as good as ever! The butler service arranged by the hotel is warm and thoughtful every time. This time the butler Anita is also the same. She contacted me one day in advance and reminded me every day without being too intrusive. She is very considerate.

msg:Haiwan Mid-Levels is well-known. I have been looking at the photos of the hot soup in the circle of friends. I used it to celebrate my mother‚Äôs birthday. Apart from the need to make an appoin**ent everywhere, it is a bit of a brain, but I am very satisfied. Every room should have a balcony, and we happen to have one on one side, with different views. You can play badminton, table tennis, basketball, swim, soak in hot springs, and steam. There are changing rooms and showers where you need to get wet. The swimming pool is also equipped with a sauna room, but the bathing pool is inconvenient, small and broken. Tangchi needs to climb mountains, which is very cruel in winter, and it is even worse when it catches up with snow. Because the group loves the parents' set meal, one dinner is included, and the iron pot stewed fish eaten outside at noon, so I am not hungry at night, and it is enough for four people. In the evening, the mother arranged to experience a half-hour massage, and then go to sleep directly after steaming the Bianstone with salt for an hour. The next day I went up a hill, but because of the rain, I didn‚Äôt go up again, to see if there is a chance to come again in autumn and enjoy the autumn scenery! Thanks to the housekeeper Meizi and Meizi from the health care center (I don‚Äôt know if I remember the name wrongly) for their great service!

Because the school is approaching, although it is expected that there will be a lot of people, there can be very few people in the wrong peak hot spring. With the thoughtful suggestion of the housekeeper Xiaohan, I have booked a Bianstone salt steam in advance, and there is also a super large children's playground and sports venues. There is everything you need without leaving the hotel, the elderly and children are very, very satisfied
The housekeeper, Xiaohan, was very helpful throughout the whole process, from before arrival to after departure. He is the one with the best overall facilities and service attitude in so many hotels in China we have stayed in!
And this time I was lucky to encounter snow on the forehead, the hot spring in the snow has a special artistic conception, and I will come again in the future!

msg:Room facilities:
The facilities are complete, WIFI direct connection is very convenient, there are bathtubs and shower cubicles, and they are relatively spacious, but the bath liquid is an empty bottle, and it is estimated that there are many people in the winter vacation, so I forgot to change it. But the service was good, it was delivered quickly and refills were added.

Dining room:
We ordered the pampering parents package, with dinner for two, cold vegetables, sauced meat and pumpkin are delicious. The main course is sea bass and tomato beef brisket. The beef brisket is relatively soft but the taste is quite satisfactory. The example soup is chicken soup, but the taste is average.

breakfast:
I forgot to take pictures, there are both Chinese and Western breakfasts, which are very rich. It is worth mentioning that the fruit quality is very good and fresh.

Leisure facilities:
The mid-mountain hot spring is worth experiencing, the water temperature is very comfortable, and the scenery is good, but there are more people on weekends. I originally wanted to watch the sunset, but there are too many people and it is not easy to take pictures.
I went to experience the physical therapy at night, and Miss Zhang's technique is very good. Although I only experienced it for half an hour, I entered a half-dream and half-awake state in just a few minutes, and I was very relaxed.

The hotel also has a hiking trail, which is closed when it gets dark. We went there early in the morning, and it takes about an hour to stop and go around the circle. It would be better if it is a season of warm spring and flowers blooming or a season of high and crisp autumn. In winter, we can only look forward to encountering sunny and sunny days.

Service: The hotel's service is very considerate. If you are an old user, you will also have an exclusive butler service. This is our first experience, and we were lucky enough to be assigned a dedicated butler. Helen is very professional, reminding every detail in place, and responding to messages in the middle of the night in seconds.
In addition, I would like to praise Chen Xiaoyun and Cao Yanlin from the guest room depar**ent. One went to the restaurant to borrow chopsticks for us at night; the other was eager to help prepare plastic bags and mineral water.

This experience is very happy, and I am generally satisfied, but because it is winter vacation + weekend, the price is really not cheap, I hope to have the opportunity to go again

Facilities: Although a little unsatisfactory, everything is easy to use, such as the bathtub in the bathroom, the phone, the shower, and the warm soup. Children may burn it when holding it. The rest are ok.
Hygiene: This is the No. 1 hot spring hotel in Beijing. The environment must be clean and in place. Anyway, I didn't find any dirty places.
Environment: The environment is very beautiful, our room is not particularly high, so it doesn't look particularly beautiful. What I saw was the elevator to go to the hot spring
Service: The service must be praised, five-star praise, Chen Xiaoyun.
The bad thing is that the hot springs are really cold. It‚Äôs really cold. It‚Äôs not recommended to go in winter, especially if you have to go to the next level after passing the ladder and putting the lockers. It‚Äôs too cold.
Outdoor children's skating experience: I don't know if I have no experience
Breakfast: Breakfast is crowded and you have to queue. It is suggested that if you go on weekends, you must eat early or late. Absolutely line up at 8 or 9 o'clock

Many people bring the elderly and children here to play, the playground, and the massage facility experience are very good~ Our two massage girls, Lily and Yoyo, are professional and gentle, super loving! After the massage, we also prepared snacks for us (to be honest, I think it is better than the dinner ordered in the western restaurant, but the whole hotel thinks the western restaurant is not good enough)
In addition to soaking in the hot springs, you can also walk on the plank road next to the hotel. The whole journey is 4.8km, basically stairs, slightly shaking, but the scenery is still good! You can see the hotel's light board when you climb up a little bit to Neptune~

msg:The winter hot springs in the north are undoubtedly the best choice, so this time I will bring the children to play. The overall environment is good, there is nothing to say about the hardware facilities, and the playground is enough for children to play. The food in the restaurant is surprisingly delicious, whether it is Chinese food or Western food, the taste is very good. This time, I took my children to live in the standard room on the second floor of the North Wing. The housekeeper Xiaohan arranged it before check-in. It is very close to the swimming pool and restaurant, so it is very convenient to play. The swimming pool has a standard pool and two small pools, one of which is a heated pool, which is very friendly to children. There is a butler leading the whole process from booking to check-in. I would also like to praise the butler Xiaohan here. He is very caring and considerate, because this trip coincides with my birthday. The butler specially presented a very beautiful small cake and longevity noodles, because Neither my child nor I have had a bad time. Xiaohan also helped us arrange the location of the private room for two consecutive days, and reminded us of the peak passenger flow of breakfast, so that we can eat at a different peak. The child suddenly had an inexplicable stomachache on the second morning of our stay. Han is also very concerned about the situation of the children. Originally, the room reserved for two days cannot be refunded the next day, so I asked whether the time can be extended if the room is not available the next day. After learning about this special situation, Xiao Han went to communicate with the manager of the hotel, and told us that it is important to take care of the children. The next day's room fee can be refunded directly, which made us feel at ease, and kept asking us if we needed help. Concerned about the condition of the child, the waiter of the hotel also sent a thermometer. Fortunately, the child recovered after a while and expressed that he wanted to continue playing, and we did not check out. I thought this was already very humane, but I didn‚Äôt expect that there would be a follow-up. During dinner, Xiao Han arranged a private room for us again. After ordering and waiting, the waitress brought me a night of hot millet porridge. I didn‚Äôt think much about it at first, I thought the restaurant would give it away uniformly, but after thinking about it the first night when I came to eat, I didn‚Äôt give it away, and then I suddenly realized that it was Xiao Han who explained to the restaurant that the child‚Äôs stomach was not feeling well when he helped us arrange the private room , so I carefully prepared millet porridge for nourishing the stomach, here again highly praised Xiao Han and the service staff of the Chinese restaurant! The child also drank up the millet porridge all night üëçI rarely eat so much at homeüòÇ. He also took the initiative to help us apply for a late check-out until two o'clock, so that we can have more time to play and rest. Before leaving, I also prepared two packs of delicious biscuits for the children to eat on the road. Asked if we got home safely after we left. The father of the middle child needs to print the work materials, and also needs to sign and stamp. The housekeeper and hotel staff have also printed them out, and prepared a signature pen and inkpad üëçOne thing to say is that this service is the ceiling of the hotel we have stayed in! It's really heartwarming and inspiring! Both my husband and I feel that the details are impeccable. Guests who want to stay in the future highly recommend everyone to come and play, and I also recommend everyone to find the butler Xiaohan, who will definitely make arrangements for every detail! Thank you again for your care in the past two days. Of course, the attitude of other service staff in the hotel is also very good. Everyone will greet you with a smile when they meet. The lady at the front desk saw me waiting on the sofa with my child when I checked out. Help send it over and put it in our bag.

Although there are many people, but the service is in place, the facilities are very good, I feel that it is worth the money, and the family members are very happy. The characteristic hot springs overlook the mountain scenery, and the winter experience is particularly warm and relaxing. Facilities such as salt steaming, fitness, and children's playgrounds also fully take into account the needs of family travel.

There are too many people for breakfast, but it may be because there are too many people during the Chinese New Year, which is understandable.

Finally, I would like to thank Ms. Kelly Sun (Â≠ôÊòéÂçé), who is gentle and enthusiastic, for her dedicated service and answering questions from check-in to departure. She is really very professional! The hotel has such excellent staff, it should add chicken legs~

msg:Don't think that expensive means high-end hotels. They are probably the kind built by locals themselves. We spent more than 3,000, but we were hit by their front door when we went out. It wasn‚Äôt that the automatic door was unattended, but the hidden door suddenly came out. If we didn‚Äôt call someone, we would probably be crushed to death by the door. The guard said that we were not the first to be crushed. It seemed like I also felt that one person was too busy with multiple posts, and the damage was over 20,000 yuan. He told me directly to respect the traffic police without any apology (the traffic police originally said that this matter was not considered a traffic accident) and they could not help me.
It was supposed to be a birthday celebration, but I was so angry that I didn't celebrate my birthday. I missed my children's classes and didn't have a car for a week. Insurance is also refunded. No greetings so far! And you asked me what happened? !
There were no signs at the hotel's hot springs at night. It was freezing outside and I walked hundreds of meters in the wind, along mountain roads and long bridges. Not to mention catching a cold, the temperature was not right and I couldn't stay there. I saw that everyone came out within a few minutes of entering.
The facilities are old and this is the most expensive hotel I have ever stayed in with no sense of service. I guess I‚Äôve seen too many complaints, so what if I just ignore them? Ctrip went to negotiate and said directly that it did not want a third party to negotiate...

msg:I booked the Little Yellow Duck parent-child room for two nights with my family. The price is also high during the Spring Festival peak season. Let‚Äôs make an overall evaluation by item:
It's more than two o'clock in the afternoon as soon as you enter the door, and you can check in after three o'clock. During the peak season, you can't check in early, which is understandable and reasonable. And before three o'clock, the front desk call and the housekeeper's WeChat will notify you that you can check in early, which is very thoughtful.
The concierge has grapefruit juice and scented tea to welcome guests. Perhaps out of environmental protection considerations, there are no disposable cups, they are all small teacups, and you need to consciously put them on the plate next to them when they are used up. This is really worrying, some customers will turn it back to the clean cup area after using it. Isn't it necessary to use water to clean the cups, which is not environmentally friendly?
Entering the room is a little yellow duck parent-child room with only one room on each floor. There is a sign on the door of the room, which means it is a room cooperated by Ctrip. After entering, it is actually a connecting room with a double bed room and a twin bed room. Seeing this layout, I thought about the many comments I read before, and I don‚Äôt remember any reviews mentioning that the little yellow duck room is this kind of connecting room . So if you know in advance that this is the form, it is better to book two rooms separately, the price will be relatively cheaper. It would be great if there were instructions to inform consumers before!
The children's club on the first floor did not feel as entertaining as it was advertised after the experience. First of all, the brightness of the lights used in the overall space is not high, which makes people feel not happy enough after entering. There are not many types of entertainment facilities, and the colors are very monotonous. Perhaps it is compared to the children's playgrounds of other parent-child hotels. It is good for children to play, and adults may make comparisons.
There are almost no elevator lights in the hotel. I don't know if it is for energy saving. In short, it feels depressing and does not match the hotel's positioning.
The breakfast buffet has a rich variety, but the emergency plan is very insufficient to cope with the reception capacity of the peak season passenger flow. As a result, it is close to 11 o'clock and the breakfast is still queuing up. The deadline for picking up meals is also at 11 o'clock, but there is no corresponding delay arrangement, so that the guests who line up later have no more time to eat. At the last closing time, when there were still many tables of diners eating, the lights in the restaurant were turned off one after another, and the waiters frantically cleaned up the tables and plates. There was a feeling of being urged, and the experience was very uncomfortable.
Regarding parking, I went out for dinner the first night, and when I came back, there were three parking spaces next to the hotel entrance, two of which were occupied, and the remaining one was told that parking was not allowed, but refused to let us park on the grounds of the fire exit. Then, if it is a fire exit, are the two cars next to it illegally occupied? Is it possible to report them? Or is this parking space reserved for hotel leaders? Or is our car not good enough to park here? unknown.
This experience was not particularly uncomfortable, because after all, it is understandable that the hotel is busy during the peak season, so the expectations are not particularly high. But the hotel is indeed not as high as it is advertised. Among all the parent-child hotels we have stayed in, none of them stand out in any aspect, so the hotel's passenger flow should be thanks to the hotel's corporate promotion.
Finally, I would like to thank the housekeeper Ada for her service. She does not rest during the Spring Festival holiday, which is very hard and not easy. But should the hotel have performance needs? The housekeepers of other hotels will not ask for nominations and praises in the comments. It is not easy for everyone, thank you very much.

First of all, the hotel butler Lillian's thoughtful and thoughtful service, because it is the first time to go to a parent-child hot spring hotel with such strong comprehensive entertainment, the caring service of the butler is indispensable, and the car cleaning is arranged in the cold winter, what I feel is the true supreme courtesy . At the same time, the child came here to celebrate his birthday, and the housekeeper carefully prepared everything for him, including delicate cakes, longevity noodles, etc. The hot springs in winter, heart-warming layout, considerate service, and wonderful activities all reflect the hotel's intentions. Once again, I would like to thank Lillian, Liu Guochun, Lou Zhiyong, Dora and other staff who served in front of us for their caring, careful and caring. I wish GBH better and better, and I will consider the hotel first when I go to Beijing.

msg:As an online celebrity hotel in Beijing, there are a lot of tourists who come on vacation during the Spring Festival, and it seems that all services are a bit stretched. The rooms basically have to wait until after three in the afternoon. Hotel services such as meals, health massage, etc. need to be booked in advance, otherwise there is a queue The waiting time is very long, and the waiting time is also a test of patience. It takes more than 20 minutes before a dish is served!
It can only be said that the hotel's reputation is greater than its service when it comes to the holidays!
During the two-day Spring Festival holiday, the weather is very cold, and climbing the mountain is a test of physical strength! It takes an hour and a half to complete the climb. Although there are not many people, the scenery is also very ordinary. Maybe there are not many scenery to see in Beijing in winter, and there are bare places everywhere!
The hot springs are also overcrowded, too prominent for parents and children. It feels like a children's playground. There are families soaking in the pools everywhere. Although there are many pools, each one is not big. Five or six people soaking in it will make the pools very crowded. In addition, some parents still leave their children's lifebuoys in the pool, which is really noisy and crowded. The temperature of the hot springs is not very high. It is too cold in Beijing in winter, so you should pay attention to keep warm when you go to the hot springs outside. It is very cold when you come out of the pool, and the wind blows directly from the middle of the mountain. When you enter the hot spring pool, you must dry yourself off immediately! Otherwise, it is easy to catch a cold, the ground of the pool is icy, and it is easy to slip and fall. The hotel should have protective measures for these details!
The room configuration is quite satisfactory, there are not many surprises! The sound insulation is not good, there are noisy children in the corridor, but the room can hear it clearly!
The overall experience is really average, I can only say that you are a tourist who is afraid of noise, so don't come here during the holidays, the experience will not be good!
There are Heilongtan, Miyun Reservoir and other scenic spots nearby. The fish in the reservoir is very fresh and tastes good!

The overall price/performance ratio of the hotel is average, and the price is really a little high compared to the service and soft and hard facilities! It is definitely not as good as Bulgari, Peninsula, Mandarin Oriental and other brand hotels in the urban area. They are used as resort hotels in the suburbs, and they are considered Internet celebrities in Beijing. They should be more famous!

The recommendation is a parent-child hotel. There is a children's playground and a swimming pool. You can also take your children to enjoy the hot springs in the middle of the mountain. They are all very good recommendations~ There is also a steam room. Both adults and children can have fun!
I am very grateful to the personal butler Susan, who contacted us before check-in, told us what we need to prepare, and asked what we need~ After check-in, she also helped me in detail. From the beginning to the end, she was very good and considerate. I will contact her next time ~At the same time, I also thank Master Gao Bo and Shi Fengming. I parked the car in the ba*****t and offered to help wash the car. I can celebrate the Spring Festival clean~

After coming to Beijing, I went to several hot spring hotels, and I was disappointed. The hot springs of the Peninsula Hotel finally feel like I am in Chengdu! !

The car was parked in the underground garage, and a waiter washed the car for free, and a waiter helped to deliver the luggage to the room. The housekeeper took us to introduce the hotel. "This is the hotel's exclusive 5-kilometer hiking route." You can climb the mountain in the morning and breathe fresh air. Here is to go to the hot spring, take the hotel's exclusive elevator to arrive, there are 12 mid-level hot springs named after the zodiac, and a closed clear spring pool. Down vests are also provided in winter, which is very considerate. Hot springs need to be reserved with a small program to control the number of people during the time period to ensure the hot spring experience.
I found that when climbing a mountain now, I have to pant three times after two steps, and soaking in hot springs is also warm and exhausting. I don't know if it is water or sweat flowing from my forehead. Breathing fresh air, soaking in ginseng hot springs, watching the sunset, drinking ginger tea, life is enough! We looked at each other in blank dismay, our skin was rosy and pale, and it looked very beautiful under the setting sun. My son and I were so curious that we visited all the zodiac pools, including milk, green tea, Linzhi, ******* medicine, angelica, ginger... Read each one. Do you know which pool has the most people? Angelica hot spring, cough and expectorant [Âë≤Áâô]
I ate western food in the evening and it tasted good.
The next morning, you can choose Western food buffet and Cantonese morning tea for breakfast. We had morning tea and it tasted good. Climbed the mountain in the morning and arrived at Uranus and Pluto. I took a beautiful photo. The butler also thoughtfully extended the check-out until 14:00 for free, which is great, the smile of the butler is always warm.
I will come again if I have the opportunity to experience different scenery in different seasons, the warmth is still there.

The 1v1 butler service is an excellent experience. The warm service made our family of three feel at home. When we learned that the child was celebrating his birthday, we even arranged a special room Carefully arranged and presented a cake, thanks to Chen Xiaoyun for the room decoration, and gave the child a special and meticulous decoration. Let us spend an unforgettable birthday.
Tangquan is halfway up the mountain. Although it is windy at night, the service staff ensure the safety of customers and timely service throughout the whole process, which makes us feel very safe.
I also experienced salt steaming and Bianstone sweat steaming. I felt VIP service throughout the whole process, because all activities in the hotel are reservation-only, and I feel that the experience is not crowded and very comfortable. Next time I bring my parents to experience it again~

msg:A hot spring outing that can be said and left.
The hotel is an Internet celebrity hotel, and the price grade determines the excellent experience.
And the biggest surprise to me this trip is the butler service.
On the second day after booking the hotel, I received a call from the butler. This girl named Helen introduced in detail the hotel's project facilities and how to use various services. In the hotel, public soup pools, Chinese and Western restaurants, and children's entertainment areas all need to be reserved in advance, and the operation of scanning codes is simple and convenient.
The existence of the butler is more like a caring assistant. For any needs, reach out to Helen. These are her exact words.
So our itinerary for two days and one night is relaxed and compact. Find Helen for the amusement park arrangement for the daughter, find Helen for the child with broken feet, find Helen for ordering meals, and find Helen for booking hot springs. And the problem was solved so easily. When we checked in, Helen took us to make appoin**ents for various activities from the afternoon of the day to the morning of the next day, and the schedule was full. After experiencing the whole process, it is compact but not hectic. Timely scene switching, hot spring, steaming, dinner, after the whole body is comfortable, the appetite is whetted.
The short time passed quickly, and there are still many projects that have not been experienced. Sorry, I will make up for it next time.

A suggestion to the hotel, that is, in the future, you can consider installing a charging pile for electric vehicles in the parking lot!
Ctrip can only upload 3 short videos of 30 seconds, and the view of the hot spring in the middle of the mountain cannot be played in the video, which is a pity.

After making the reservation this time, I received a call from the exclusive housekeeper, Ms. Zhu Meizi, from Vivian Zhu Meizi one day before check-in. She introduced the hotel's features and various experience items in detail, and made a detailed reservation for us. . Several major features of this hotel: 1) The main building is divided into the south area and the north area. It is built on the mountain, and the 5th floor of the south area is connected with the 1st floor (G floor) of the north area; it takes a little time to warm up and get familiar with the terrain. But in fact, it adds to the fun; the back mountain is named after the check-in points of the 8 planets (Pluto was eliminated), and a small hike of about 3.5 kilometers is arranged. The highest altitude is only 240 meters. There are steps and wooden planks. For children Very friendly with old people. 2) The hot spring is located outdoors, you need to wear a swimsuit + hotel bathrobe, then take the elevator and walk about 300 meters to get there; the semi-open-air soup pool named after the twelve zodiac signs can avoid hypoxia and enjoy the scenery, but the mountain wind is strong at night , the elderly in the hot springs in the evening in autumn and winter need to be cautious (it‚Äôs okay during the day); 3) All kinds of experience projects need to make an appoin**ent, and these appoin**ents have certain rules and restrictions (such as a single day, or a relative total number of people) , and very user-friendly (items can be canceled and rescheduled, rescheduled after expiration, multiple projects can be reserved at the same time, etc.), after we experience it, we feel that making a reservation is generally conducive to allowing more guests to experience More projects, so don't be afraid of trouble, there is a QR code to adjust the appoin**ent at any time. The staff of the hotel are very friendly and will take the initiative to greet with a smile; our exclusive butler Ms. Name) are very kind and friendly, the service is thoughtful and patient, and the management is very humanized, which made our New Year's trip very warm and pleasant. I would like to express my gratitude to all of you and wish you a happy new year!

msg:It‚Äôs the second time I‚Äôve come to Haiwan Mid-levels. The first time was summer. This time I‚Äôve experienced winter. The biggest problem in winter is the outdoor walk from the room to the Mid-level hot spring. It‚Äôs very cold. The hotel has carefully prepared cotton vests, which are very useful, but The place for putting cotton vests is relatively limited. There are many clothes in winter, but the lockers in the hot springs cannot be used. It is recommended to restore the use of the lockers. The first time I came, there was a queue for breakfast. This weekend, I added a Cantonese breakfast restaurant, which is very user-friendly. , the most important thing is that the taste and environment are very good, the elderly and children can eat very comfortably, the Saturday dinner is also eaten at the Chinese restaurant, the dishes are quite satisfactory, you need to book a seat in advance, there are still many people, this is the first time I went to the hill behind the hotel. The scenery is good. I climbed to the top and then returned the same way. I didn‚Äôt climb a circle. Finally, the most important thing is that the service of the housekeeper Nancy is too thoughtful. I contacted the day before and provided various service facilities after adding WeChat. The opening hours, reservation method, and even the menu were sent in advance. After arriving at the store, I arranged for the children's bathrobes, cotton vests, and toiletries, and helped to book the location of the restaurant. Finally, I left a pair of sneakers and helped to get them to the lobby. I stayed for two nights , the service is amazing üëè

msg:I have been paying attention to this internet celebrity hotel a long time ago. After booking the room, the housekeeper Ada added a WeChat message on the day of early check-in, and warmly reminded all the precautions, and was greeted at the door on the day of check-in. The decoration of the hotel is very luxurious, and the quality is displayed everywhere. The dinner is divided into Cantonese style and Western style, and the taste is very good. The water quality of the swimming pool in the hotel is very good, the gymnasium can play badminton and basketball, and the facilities are very new. Children's playgrounds can entrust children to teachers and liberate parents. Several waitresses in the housekeeping depar**ent are very enthusiastic. Under the leadership of Manager Cao and Director Yang, the quality of service is very good. Here, I want to commend Chu Wenlian, Yu Guizhen, Miao Cui and Xiao Fengqing. They not only help us clean the room, but also help us fold the clothes. , which moved us very much. The parking lot was a little tight, but the waiter was very flexible and helped me temporarily arrange a nearest parking space. However, the only thing I want to make is that the elimination of mosquitoes needs to be taken a step further. There are too many stink bugs in the hot spring pool, and the children are scared back to the room after soaking for a while. In addition, the hotel restaurant charges too high, 200 yuan per capita may not be enough to eat, although it is positioned as a high-end parent-child hot spring hotel, it should not be too detached from reality.

Miyun is a bit far away, but the hot springs in the mountains are worth a visit, and the price/performance ratio is still very high. I highly recommend it.

The hotel is built in a mountain col, and the hiking trails are already bald in mid-November, and there are no restaurants and businesses around.

Advantages: Butler service is meticulous, Ms. Helen is very nice, extra points. The hot spring pool is very beautiful to watch the sunset, and the steam room is also worth experiencing.

Disadvantages: If you come to live in a twin room with your parents, you need to pay 400 extra for 1 adult. You will only know it when you check in. Everyone needs to pay attention. The garden view room is in the south area, a little far away from the lobby and the hot spring.

It was so comfortable.
The hotel parking is very convenient, and the underground garage can also help to wash the car for free. My car originally needed to be washed. Unexpectedly, the two staff members of "Gao Bo, Shi Fengming" in the underground parking lot helped to wash the car clean.
Entering the lobby, my housekeeper "Xue Haiyang" warmly helped entertain and deal with various problems throughout the whole process.
However, on weekends, there are a lot of people at the Bayan Banshan Hot Spring Hotel. There are many people at breakfast and dinner. Fortunately, the housekeeper has helped to deal with it.
Bring the family again next time!

msg:On the wedding anniversary, the housekeeper Xiao Han contacted me one day in advance to confirm the itinerary, and prepared a honeymoon room. When I arrived at the store later, I deliberately delayed my check-out until 2 pm, and went to the hot spring in the evening. The hot spring is on the mountain, and the water is circulating water. Put a medicine bag in it. A separate room, due to seasonal reasons, there are quite a lot of stinky elder sisters, all of which are floating on the water. The body is very smelly, and the salvage is not timely. Contact the housekeeper and deal with it in time. The service is in place, and the deputy manager of the lobby took the initiative to apologize, with a good attitude. , also very sincere, sent red wine to express apology. The breakfast is too general, the variety is poor, not five-star standard, more general. Overall very pleasant, except for the hot springs and breakfast

msg:I chose the first weekend after the 11th National Day. I wanted to avoid the peak of the holiday. The hotel was very popular, and there were still a certain number of lodging staff. The hotel fee includes health salt steam, hot springs, children's playground, and a minibar, which is still very good, especially the mid-level hot springs and swimming pools, which are very good. Although many stinky sisters (little moths) were encountered unexpectedly this season, the hotel staff cleaned up in a timely and thoughtful manner, and did not cause any accommodation obstacles. The housekeeper Luna Zhang introduced the hotel service facilities and precautions in detail, and also helped coordinate the time of salt steaming. Qingqing and Meizi from the health room provided us with meticulous and thoughtful service, thank you very much. There is also the service guy at the hot spring, who is also very amiable and reminds us of the precautions for using the hot spring. Because there are many stinky elder sisters (little moths), the cleaning elder sister of the hot spring comes to clean up the bugs every five minutes. The bar staff were also active in helping to clean up bugs flying into the lobby. There are also waiters in the swimming pool and badminton hall (chubby girls and taller girls) who are also very nice. The overall facilities of the hotel are very tall and the environment is good. There is a climbing trail in the back mountain. The whole is super five-star level. The patience and thoughtfulness of every grass-roots service staff contributes to the overall service level of the hotel, which constitutes the overall high level. it's actually very good. During the epidemic period, I couldn't go out of Beijing, and the weather gradually became colder. The strong wind and cooling overnight dispelled all the insects. Plan to find time to go again with friends or family. Speaking of family, the hotel facilities are also friendly to the elderly and children. thumbs up.

Children's playground: The children's playground is very big, and the children are very happy, but the slides are too big, it would be nice if there was a slightly smaller one
We also experienced the gym and thanked Coach Guo Jiaojiao and Xiaoxing from the gym. We took our children with them and accompany them all the way to let us play well. Thank you üôè and will remind us to slide carefully and offer towel and hot water service. Thoughtful and gave the child a small gift
Finally, I would like to thank Chen Nan, who arranged the room, for handwritten greeting cards and a birthday scene for the child. The arrangement was very beautiful. Before leaving, I also gave a small gift. Thank you very much.
He Ye, the manager of the Chinese restaurant, specially prepared small cakes for us. The service attitude is good. He has been talking to the baby and asking if the baby is delicious.
The overall experience is really good. I have nothing to say about the service. I think the price is more than half of the service. Many of the hair dryers are hardware. In fact, they can be upgraded to the western restaurant. will come again

msg:I booked a room a day in advance because it was a weekend, so many places were out of room, so I didn‚Äôt do any homework, but actually it was worth it when I arrived at the hotel‚úåÔ∏è
The first is the housekeeper of the hotel. I received a call from the housekeeper Sally on the way, and added WeChat to introduce the hotel check-in, parking and in-hotel activities reservation matters. During the stay, I also took the initiative to inform how to make an appoin**ent, suggesting that the pillow can be changed, and if you have any questions, please consult They also responded quickly and helped to extend the check-out until 13:00, which is very considerateüëçüëç
The second is the environmental facilities. From the periphery to the room to the activities, it gives people a clean and comfortable feeling. The children's toilets, bathrobes, stools, slippers, etc. in the room are all available, and the children who enter the room are completely curious. The heart replaces the unfamiliarity. The hot spring and swimming pool experience is also very good. The constant temperature of the swimming pool is very friendly to children. There are 12 pools in the mid-mountain hot spring, medicinal soup and cold soup. Excellent ‚úåÔ∏è
The third is service. When booking, you will be prompted to check in at 15:00. When you check in at 12:00, you will be prompted that there is a room available and you can enter directly. At 3:00, welcome fruit will be delivered. The child is two and a half years old, whether it is in the swimming pool or the children's playground, All received friendly attention from the service staff, reminding you to wear a hat when swimming, and reminding you that the slide is higher and you may be afraid to wait. It is very considerate, so that children can feel more at ease when they playüëè
The fourth is diet. I have eaten both Chinese and Western food restaurants. There are few types of Western food. Pizza, Big Mac burgers, and pasta are all available in sufficient quantities. Children also like to eat them. Chinese dishes are richer. The two Chinese dishes are not the same. Fish soup wontons are especially popular with the elderly and children. Mooncakes are also given. There are both Western and Chinese food in the buffet. There are quite a lot of people who choose Western food.
The conclusion is that the elderly and children say they will come again, and they have captured their hearts haha~ Then look forward to the mid-mountain after autumn‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è

Because I couldn't go out of Beijing, I brought my baby to the bay to experience the hot springs. The day before check-in, the housekeeper Xiao Han contacted us to learn more about our check-in time and needs. When we arrived at the hotel in the afternoon the next day, the room was ready, and the children's toiletries were also carefully prepared, and the mini bar was also fully replenished. During our stay, the housekeeper Xiao Han was very good. He always helped us solve problems in time, and also helped us book salt steam and restaurants in the health center. The minibar was added to us the next day, which made it feel like home.
The whole hotel is built on the mountain, the hot spring is built on the middle of the mountain, and the hot spring pools are half open, and the scenery is also very good. On the first day of our stay, we went to soak in the soup. On the first day, we chose a higher location for the soup pool. The scenery was good, but the water temperature was not high, but the children had a great time playing in the soup pool for an hour. I went to Tangchi at noon on the second day. The experience was better. The temperature was higher than the first day. It was more comfortable to soak in the soup. In particular, I would like to thank Baiqiu, Xiao Lou and Lao Zheng from Tangchi for arranging a separate soup pool for us. Basically, our family is alone. We all had a great time soaking in a soup pool. Baiqiu also brought us mineral water and reminded the children to add more water when they were soaking in the soup, which was very considerate.
The children's playground is also a surprise this time. It's really big, clean and tidy. It's everything inside. It's great! The children had so much fun at the kids club that they didn't want to go home. Thanks to Xiao Yang and Aunt Mei, they were very patient with the children and provided the children with tissues to wipe sweat and water in time.
We stayed in a garden-view king-size room, in the south building, downstairs is the children's club, which is very convenient, the high-floor view is also good, the room is cleaned very cleanly, and the service provided by the housekeeping depar**ent is also very fast and responsive.
In terms of food and beverages, the buffet breakfast is rich in food, and children like it very much. I ate at a Chinese restaurant and a western restaurant for dinner, and the restaurant service was also very good.
This stay is really a very good experience! So the staff are very friendly and attentive, and will come again next time.

msg:The hot spring hotel next to Miyun Reservoir~ The bubble pool on the middle of the mountain is a special feature. It is relatively dry in the afternoon, so it is reserved. The zodiac-themed soup pool has different effects and temperatures. You can try a few more~
The badminton and table tennis halls provided by the hotel are inflatable outdoor venues, which are quite interesting. The equipment is provided, and you can reserve the activity time from the WeChat applet.
Picture 1 is the entrance to the back mountain trail of the hotel next to the waterfall next to the rockery. It is strongly recommended to climb the mountain in the morning or evening. There are several viewing platforms. It is not difficult to walk for an hour and take pictures!
The Chinese restaurant can have set menu options for dinner, which is quite cost-effective and tastes good~
Less than two kilometers away from the hotel is the Feinong town of Vanke. By the way, you can take pictures. The cafe inside is very elegant.
All in all, a leisure hotel worth visiting~

msg:It took more than an hour to drive on the Jingcheng Expressway and arranged the guest room in the south area. It was a bit like walking in a maze. The lighting in the corridor was a little dim, but the room was clean and tidy. There were also bathrobes and slippers for the children. green. Catching up with the rain that day did not affect our itinerary to soak in the hot spring. It felt good to soak in the hot spring with the sound of the rain. Because of the rain, we did not go out to the hotel to eat. The hotel has room service, which is especially thoughtful and delivered to the room. The hotel's children's play facilities are very large, and the children have a great time. The next day it rained and the weather was fine, the weather was very good, it was cool beside the waterfall, and I climbed the mountain for a while, the scenery was beautiful, and the hotel breakfast was rich in varieties of Chinese and Western food. The hotel service is attentive from the welcome guy at the front door to the housekeeper Ada. Every staff member will take the initiative to greet me warmly. In addition, I would like to thank Feng Xiangguo and Liu Wuchou of the security affairs depar**ent for cleaning the exterior of my car. Before leaving, the housekeeper Ada also gave the children delicious ice cream and a gift box of moon cakes from the hotel. This trip was a bit rushed and only stayed for one day. The children said that they would stay for two more days next time.

Service: Thanks to my housekeeper, Miss Amy, for greetings every morning and evening. The meal time will also be informed in advance, and every day you will ask if you need a water bar and toiletries. Basically 24 hours to find her anytime, very caring. Because I had to drive around during the day, the night before I finally left the store, Gao Bo and Shi Fengming also arranged for the car to be washed overnight, and the car was washed very cleanly. Thank you very much.

Environment: The health soup pool in the middle of the bay is built on the mountain, and you can see the scenery on the mountain when you soak in the hot spring. The hotel has its own waterfall, you can climb the mountain in the morning, it is recommended.

msg:The second time I came to Mid-levels, I refreshed my good impression last time. Before, it was because of the hotel facilities and hot springs. This time, I had even more experience with the [Parent-Child Hotel].

Let's talk hardware first. The hotel room facilities and sanitation can reach the five-star standard, which is very important for us parents and mothers who are dragging their families, especially children who have a small schedule and may have to stay in the house for more than half of their time. If the room It's uncomfortable to imagine how regretful it will be. This is also the reason why the Internet celebrity Jinhai Lake Bibo Island was abandoned this time - no matter how beautiful the scenery is, it is also a big problem that the hotel can't keep up.

Hot spring hotel, hot spring is the highlight. I thought it would be very hot to soak in the hot springs in summer, but it was also cool in the mountains when it was raining and cloudy these two days. The hot spring is on the mountain, there are about 6-7 soup pools, and the scenery is also very unique. The only fly in the oin**ent is that it only opens at 10 am. If the swimming pool can be opened at 7 o'clock, it will be more friendly to us mothers who want to bring their babies during the day.

Speaking of swimming, it's really great to start at 7am. These two days, I took advantage of the children to sleep in the morning and took a morning swim. There were few people and it was quiet and comfortable.

Dabao's favorite children's club has a lot of space. There are climbing slide groups suitable for older children, as well as ocean balls and large soft building blocks suitable for children over 1 year old. If the number of people is small, children can also be managed. Parents who accompany their children can sit on the bar stools outside, and Bao Dad is very happy to accompany Da Bao here - to work.

Speaking of service. Service is particularly important for "parent-child hotels", and there is not much that can really be done - not to set up some children's facilities to become "parent-child", but to truly consider the guests from the heart and solve the actual needs of the guests . Here we must like our housekeeper Luna with real name, from the very first warm greetings, introducing hotel services, to actually helping us solve problems (the room coordination problem is troublesome, and thank you for the help of the lobby manager Jason), and every night Insider tips to make our three days and two nights here easy and enjoyable.

The impression of a hotel is first established by the staff we meet, and the experience everywhere in the hotel makes us feel [at home]
- Security Affairs Depar**ent Yu Zhaowei and Feng Xiangguo, clean our car
- Wang Mei in the children's club, warm service and very patient with children
- Attentive guidance from the guys at the Concierge
- The apricots in the swimming pool and the little lefties in the hot spring pool are friendly and polite

Of course, there is still room for improvement. For example, there are fewer time choices for parent-child activities, and there are also fewer places, so none of the activities can participate. I just hope that the hotel I like is getting better and better.

All in all, happy with this choice. There will be a chance to come again.

‚ÄãFirst of all, I would like to thank the housekeeper, Ms. Zhou, for giving the hotel relevant information and suggestions the day before check-in, and for arranging the check-in room in advance, so that we did not miss every wonderful project of the hotel, especially for children. It is recommended that friends who check in can also make arrangements in advance. Ask for the timetable!

‚ÄãSecondly, because of Amy's schedule, children's activities are not missed, DIY, little baker [charged], stacking towels, children's amu*****t park... I would like to praise the children's activity arrangement, which is very suitable for 5-12 year olds Children, Xiao He and Xiao Zhang from the Children's Center have been accompanying the children throughout the whole process. They have a kind attitude and make the children reluctant to leave. The children DIY a lot of fun little works, which is very fulfilling! Sister Sunny, from the children's amu*****t park, The child specifically said that he wanted to give a thumbs up. The child said that the amu*****t park is very clean, the sisters are very nice, and the inside is also great. There are ocean balls, slides, and trampolines! The above activities are basically participated by the children themselves, with a small phone. Watches, participate in various activities by myself, I just go to check the results, my husband and I are free to travel by ourselves!
‚ÄãThe next morning we got up and climbed the hill of the hotel. It was very relaxing and the air was fresh and awesome!

The disadvantage is that the mosquitoes on the balcony of the many rooms are chasing and biting, spraying medicine and biting, and then the hotel asks for toilet water. On the day I was bitten, it was raining, accompanied by the rain and the cool breeze. It was very nice to soak in the hot springs, but there were too many people who wanted to soak in the mountains. If you want to take a dip in the mountains, you need to make an appoin**ent. The pasta and Hainanese chicken rice are delicious. The lobster is very fresh. The service is very good and thoughtful. I booked a hot spring room and sent two boxes of moon cakes. The minbar is also free.

msg:Seizing the tail of the summer vacation, I took the elderly and children on a staggered trip (check in on Monday). Before checking in, Luna, the housekeeper, added WeChat to introduce the hotel's location and attractions. There are parking spaces above and below the hotel. We arrived at the hotel at 2 pm and was told that the underground was full, so we stopped in the villa area. The check-in procedure was convenient and fast, and then Luna made a show room. In the afternoon, I made an appoin**ent for the Children's Paradise and Banshan Hot Spring on the applet. The environment of the children's playground is clean and tidy, and the service staff are very friendly. Personally, I feel that the colors of the park (white and blue) are too monotonous, and some facilities can be added for entertainment. The Banshan Hot Spring is indeed worth experiencing. Enjoying the sunset and mountain views while soaking in the soup is pleasant. Several waiters in Tangchi (Lao Zheng and Baiqiu) brought us sour plum soup and specially sent us a few bottles of mineral water. Very caring! For dining, I went to a western restaurant. Dinner and breakfast the next day were in the western restaurant. The dishes were average. The breakfast variety was not too small, but the quality was average (except for fruits). The next day, I went to checkout and gave moon cakes. Luna also gave the children ice cream, which was very considerate. Thanks here! The overall feeling of the hotel is good, suitable for family leisure vacation!

The night before check-in, I received a check-in call and WeChat from the hotel housekeeper Helen, and made a warm introduction. I felt that the hotel service was very considerate.
    Arrived at the store at two o'clock in the afternoon on Monday and was ready to check in. Helen led us to visit the hotel and gave a detailed introduction. The service was thoughtful, and the overall service attitude of the service staff in the store was very good and enthusiastic. The hotel has complete facilities, including hot springs, children's playground, plank road, gymnasium, swimming and fitness, and the environment is beautiful. You can meet the entertainment needs in the hotel! The food is also good, the Chinese and Western restaurants are good, there are many options, and the breakfast is rich. Even in the summer, there are still many people. It would be better to go as early as possible for breakfast.
     Finally, a special thanks to Helen, the warm and considerate service made our journey perfect and warm, and I hope to see you next time!

The garage attendants Yu Zhaowei and Fu Wensheng also washed the car for free. The hotel is really user-friendly. Taking the children to the hot springs, the hot spring waiters Xiao Chu and Sister Han are also enthusiastic and thoughtful. Xiao Chu has been running up and down to help get drinks and water. There are bugs in the hot spring pool, and they will be dealt with in time if they are found, and they will also tell the children to soak in the hot springs. Be sure to drink more water. During the Mid-Autumn Festival, the hotel will also send moon cakes. The moon cakes are also delicious for children. The food in the Chinese restaurant and Western restaurant is also delicious. The price is slightly expensive, but the taste is good. Overall very recommended.

For breakfast and lunch, we choose the buffet category of western restaurants. Many grandma's noodle windows have been queuing up all the time. It should be delicious (but I don't like eating noodles very much in the morning). There are not many beef noodles for lunch and dinner. The taste of the noodles is also excellent. I also tasted the taste of Tom Yum Kung soup.
During the stay, I also made an appoin**ent for my mother to have a Swedish massage in the health center. My mother felt very comfortable and the service was very thoughtful.
There are many hot spring pools, but it is really rare to encounter a room with no one, and it is embarrassing to soak with other people. Each hot spring pool is not large, and I personally think it is not very convenient.
Very nice trip, will come again in autumn and winter! !

The hotel is on the mountain, and the scenery of each soup pool is particularly beautiful, which is suitable for traveling with friends. The butler service was great, our housekeeper Sally started making various reminders the day before check-in to ensure travel. And no matter the time to find her, she will always reply within 5 minutes. Few hotel service follow-up can achieve such fast feedback and 24-hour online service, which is very reassuring.
When I first checked in, the child forgot the phone and watch at the front desk, and Sally helped to retrieve it in time, which was so sweet. It also prompts the use time of various venues and asks if drinking water is required. From 6 bottles per day, unlimited, mini bar is also free. There is also a super large children's playground, which feels like a private room.
I also used the gymnasium during the stay. The super-large venue has few people and the service is good. The service staff Linlin, Nana, and Lao Guo are all very good. I forgot my bag in the table tennis area and sent it to me. I coaxed, badminton, basketball, table tennis, played over and over again.
In short, a very good experience of staying, I feel like I have a vacation without being in Beijing. There is a chance that winter will come again, and the hot spring experience should be better.

msg:The baby is on summer vacation, and it is quite frustrating to leave Beijing to play due to the impact of the epidemic, so I chose to travel to the suburbs, and finally checked in at this parent-child hotel recommended by many friends. The hotel is located in a beautiful environment. From the waterfall rock, you can directly lead to the hiking trail. The hiking time of about an hour is suitable for taking children. The hotel deserves to be the main theme of parent-child, there are a variety of parent-child activities, the children have a great time in the hotel, and the schedule for three days and two nights can be very full. In addition, the hotel also provides a considerate butler service. Thanks to the housekeeper Nancy for her warm and thoughtful service, she can respond to any problems in a timely and efficient manner. Before leaving, the baby accidentally broke the back of the head, and Nancy arranged the driver to take us to the hospital as soon as possible. In autumn and winter, there is a chance to bring the baby to the second brush hotel.

msg:It takes about an hour and a half to drive in the urban area of Beijing. The private soup room has good privacy. However, if there are few people in the soup pool in the middle of the mountain, it is basically a room per family, which is similar to the private soup. The children's playground is very large, but I feel that the space utilization rate can be improved further, and it is better to add some amusement facilities. The biggest feeling is the service. The staff are basically enthusiastic and not blunt (of course, there are some special ones). The butler service of the hotel is very considerate. Special thanks to our handsome Jiang Hao. There are two western restaurants and two Chinese restaurants. I feel that the taste and service of the western restaurants are better. The restaurant manager Nancy is very friendly and even gave the baby freshly squeezed juice. In addition, I would like to thank Gao Bo from the Safety Affairs Depar**ent, and Master Shi Fengming took the initiative to help clean the vehicle. To sum up, the biggest feature of the hotel is the soup pool in the middle of the mountain. It is equipped with top-level services and is suitable for taking children and the elderly on vacation. There will be opportunities in the future.

Take the elevator from the hotel to the mountain, there are 12 semi-open-air viewing soup pools and an indoor soup pool. The indoor soup pool has a changing room, towels are distributed at the entrance, and there are two drinking areas on the mountain road. The 12 soup pools are named after the 12 zodiac signs, with different "seasonings", and the water temperature is not the same. From the hotel to the elevator, and the mountain road to Tangchi, it is open-air, and if the weather is bad, it will be more affected.
The buffet breakfast is quite rich, and you have to wait for a table during peak hours. The manager, Nancy, attaches great importance to the opinions of the guests, and prepared egg custard and vegetable fruit plate for the baby at noon.
From the room service to the children's playground, the service attitude of the staff everywhere is good. Feng Xiangguo and Liu Wuchou from the security affairs depar**ent also helped wash the car.

The housekeeper Luna added WeChat to communicate various details one day in advance, and can meet various needs anytime and anywhere during the stay. I also gave the children ice cream when they left the store, which is super satisfied.
‚ú® Catering: The Chinese restaurant tastes good, and the Cantonese breakfast has not had time to experience, so leave some suspense for the next time. I have eaten several times in the western restaurant. The variety of breakfast is quite satisfactory, not bad or bad. The hamburger in the Gulf is very generous, and the steak is average. It would be nice if there was a buffet dinner in the evening.
‚ú®Wellness Center: The environment is good, private enough, and quiet enough. The two-person spa met two technicians, Lily. Oda's technique was very good. The Swedish massage we chose was suitable for strength and relieved fatigue. My husband and I were very satisfied.
‚ú®Fitness Center: Experienced basketball, badminton and table tennis respectively. The reservation system is very good, avoiding crowds. Coach Guo and Coach Xing are very responsible, and the technicians replenished water and towels for us.
‚ú®Banshan Hot Spring: The environment is good, there are many kinds of soup springs, and the water quality is also considered clean. The fly in the oin**ent is that even if you make an appoin**ent, you cannot avoid the embarrassment of two families in the same soup spring. There are supply stations with free sour plum soup and lemonade to drink. The little brothers and sisters who serve are also answering questions and welcoming them with smiles.
ü§îGenerally speaking‚ùáÔ∏èThe waiters in Mid-Levels are very enthusiastic, answering basic questions and having a strong sense of service. This is definitely beyond imagination. The variety of catering can be increased. Although there are free drinks, the price of Coke Sprite It is also a bit exaggerated. 38, if you like to drink carbonated drinks, you can bring your own.

I have to say that this hotel is really suitable for people who are in a state of anxiety. Occasionally relax, from the elderly to children, you can find them here. own fun. To be honest, it is not that the peak period is full of experience. Every employee is full of enthusiasm and patience. Although the manager Pt is young, he is very gentlemanly and very nice. This time, I saw that the private soup pool has been re-tiled to take advantage of the epidemic, and it is really good that it is not slippery. You can rest assured that children can play.
My mother likes to play ball, especially in the hotel's air chamber, where basketball, badminton, and table tennis are available. This time, I met the kind grandpa Guo Jianli. Prepare warm water and towels. My mother also played her favorite badminton in the hotel these few days. The racket in the arena feels good. If there are not too many people, you don‚Äôt need to bring your own. Of course, there is also Xing Lina in the gymnasium and gym. Gao Hui, Xiao He also thank you for your patient service.
The children's paradise is a children's paradise. I reported almost every day during the stay in the hotel. The child met Wang Chunmei's grandma again. After ten months, he stayed at the hotel again. The child still has some impressions of his grandmother. I became more and more familiar, and became good friends with my grandmother, and of course the lovely Aunt Yang, they were all too patient. When the child comes to the park, grandma and aunt will provide socks on their own initiative to remind the child to be careful when the ground slips. They will also conduct regular inspections, clean up toys, check whether there are foreign objects in the ocean ball, and use a small watering can to sterilize. In this park, you can put Let the children play wildly, and everything is at ease.
This time, my old housekeeper in the front office, Susan, made an appoin**ent. This time I came to catch up with her vacation. The whole process was coordinated through WeChat, which also delayed a lot of her rest time. I am really grateful to her. Originally, the group ticket was reserved for two days of private soup, but the baby didn't have enough fun and asked him to renew it for two days, and asked her to help me formulate a suitable price plan. Thank you very much dear.
The day before I was about to check out, Liu Guochun and Chen Xuqiang from the Security Affairs Depar**ent also helped me wash my car. The exterior was washed very carefully. I sincerely thank every employee of the Gulf Mid-Levels Hotel I met. I will go there in the off-season.

msg:High quality beyond expectations!
Because of my birthday, but I couldn't travel to Beijing, I chose this hotel from a thousand choices, mainly because there were basically no bad reviews on various review sites. Sure enough, this trip is well deserved.
1. First-class service: the most meticulous and thoughtful service among the hotels I have stayed at so far, including comparison with hotels in Sanya. Before check-in, there was contact with the service housekeeper. After that, the whole process was very caring, the feedback was quick and considerate, and a birthday cake was specially prepared. Thank you Amy Zhou Jiaqi! The parking lot staff also wiped the car clean, and those who parked on the ground also put on sunscreens. The guys at the hot springs are gentle and warm, in short, the service can't fault anything.
2. The hardware facilities and environment are good: everywhere is very clean, there are staff cleaning and cleaning up, almost no debris and dust can be seen, especially in the children's playground, you can sit anywhere, I am surprised how it can be kept so clean. Needless to say, the scenery on the mountainside is natural, and the pavilions in the garden are also antique and elegant.
3. Recreational items: Living for one day is really not enough to play, there are twelve hot spring pools, you can take a dip while overlooking the mountains and surrounds, there is a large pool in the swimming pool, two small warm water pools, whether you can swim or not, you can enjoy yourself. , The children's playground is very large, even larger than some special children's playgrounds, and it is very interesting. It is no problem to spend a few hours. The stadium has basketball, badminton, table tennis, and I didn't have time to experience it this time.
4. Eat: The breakfast is the standard of a five-star hotel. Other meals may be due to the epidemic. There are only two restaurants, a Chinese restaurant and a western restaurant. The price is not low, but the quality is really good and the quantity is large.

In this summer when the place is crowded with people, although the house is full, there is a rare tranquility. I didn't see the crowd, and I wondered where everyone went. All in all, will be back in the near future, hope to stay for two nights and enjoy.

In the evening, the nutritious combination of dishes in a Chinese restaurant was met with the second touch. The waiter Kay Wang was really enthusiastic and attentive, and he responded to every request. There are many activities in the hotel.

Improve. The third person who touched the gymnasium was Xing Lina, Guo Jianqi, who cared meticulously about my child's sports and helped me find a solution when I learned about my child's special sports needs. The fourth sister, Mei, who was moved by the salt steam room, has been taking the trouble to take pictures and introduce me. I feel that I will take the old man again. The hardware facilities of the hotel are not mentioned. The super comfortable environment, the super beautiful hot spring pool, the breakfast is also very rich, and the two days are very fulfilling. Although the room price is very expensive, the price is very special. High, especially the service in place, this is the most commendable, it makes customers feel very warm, and this hotel culture is worth promoting. In the era of the epidemic, it is impossible to go abroad and go to Beijing, and the competitiveness of the surrounding hotels is reflected in the service that is at home. There is no one, it is definitely the ceiling of the hot spring hotel.

msg:The hotel that has been planted for a long time has high scores and classification rankings. The actual experience is indeed well-deserved. Whether it is hardware facilities or services, it is worthy of a five-star diamond, especially the service. That is more than service. Special thanks to the housekeeper Xiaohan, the service is very good from beginning to end, and the thought is very detailed and comprehensive! I would also like to thank the two masters Liu and Feng of the Safety Depar**ent who took the initiative to help wash the car. The car was washed very cleanly! In short, the hotel has no shortcomings except for the expensive price and the poor experience of hot springs on weekends. I will go again if I have the opportunity!

It is the first time I have experienced the real &quot;housekeeper&quot; service after staying in so many hotels. There is also a master Gao Bo who helps find underground parking spaces and can wash cars for free. The other service staff also have a high sense of service, and they will greet us warmly when they meet us! In addition to hot springs, the hotel also has swimming pools, gyms and sports halls. There are both Chinese and Western food. The most important thing is that you can climb mountains! It was so fulfilling and comfortable to spend two days here! Maybe the hotel has not been fully built, and the facilities on the mountain are not complete. I hope it will be more fun when it is built! Already looking forward to the next visit!

I am very grateful to my housekeeper Nancy, who communicated by phone the night before check-in and learned that I had Xiaobao to take a nap. He was very enthusiastic to help communicate the matter of early check-in the next day. When we arrived at the store that day, Nancy was already greeted in the lobby, not only He helped us check in, and introduced the hotel facilities and various activities patiently and meticulously. Before each meal, he would enthusiastically suggest restaurants and dishes according to our needs. Because of Nancy, this vacation has become more convenient. ~

There are also two masters, Gao Bo and Shi Fengming from the Security Affairs Depar**ent, who are very enthusiastic and meticulous to wash away the dust for our car, making this holiday a little brighter~

In addition, the hot springs in the middle of the mountain, the huge children's amusement park, and the scenic hiking trails have all captured the hearts of the children, and they are already looking forward to the next vacation in the half-mountain bay!

The semi-enclosed hot spring on the mountain feels good. We only went up at 10 o'clock in the evening at the last time we made an appoin**ent. There are basically no people. Two people enjoy a theme room alone, which feels a bit private. Amusement parks and swimming pools are the best places for children. Love~ But there are 2 points that deserve my full 5-star praise this time: Beck, the personal butler we stayed at this time, was warm and thoughtful, arranged meticulously and thoughtfully, and I am very grateful to him for making our trip smooth and enjoyable. There is also a dessert house on the first floor. This dessert is really good and the price is very reasonable. It is not particularly sweet and must be praised!

msg:It was my first time staying at this hotel and I wrote a review spontaneously after checking out. Four-star and five-star resort hotels around Beijing have basically stayed. In terms of hardware, this hotel should be in the top three. The Tangquan in the middle of the mountain is an independent bubble pool in the nature on the mountain. It has the charm of the Tangquan in Guangdong in the south, and is almost unique around Beijing. The hotel has its own section of mountain road. It takes about 40 minutes to go up and down the mountain. It is just right for parents and children. The hotel&#39;s swimming pool is also good, the water temperature is suitable, and the water quality is relatively clean. The Chinese restaurant is very good in the resort hotel. After three or four meals, it will not be repeated, and the taste is also very good. Most notable is the service. As far as the hotel&#39;s service is concerned, it definitely stands out among all the five-star hotels in Beijing. The housekeeper, Sally, contacted before check-in and asked if there were any children accompanying him. He prepared bathrobes and toiletries for children. After arriving at the store, he kept in touch to help with various reservations. When he left the store, he extended the room to 14:00. There is also ice cream for the kids. Many hotels have proposed such a butler style, but this one is the best. Parked in the underground garage, Shi Fengming, Hu Yu, and Gao Bo from the Security Affairs Depar**ent also volunteered to help with the car wash. Although the hardware of the hotel is first-class, the service here is more expected than the hardware. I lament that the management model of the hotel can make the front-line employees achieve excellence in every detail, which is worth learning from other hotels and even enterprises.

msg:Five stars to give, thanks to sally, tina, and Xiao Yang for their excellent service... Next, let's start commenting
advantage:
1. The hotel is big enough with complete facilities, suitable for people of all ages
2. The scenery is good enough. There are rockeries, fountains, and hills that can be climbed on foot.
3. There are three swimming pools with different temperatures. The water temperature of the large swimming pool is the friendliest (warm) of all hotels in Beijing that I have been to.
4. The indoor children's playground is large enough to satisfy children of all ages
5. There are full-time porters at check-in and check-out and the efficiency is very high
6. The breakfast is rich enough, you can eat well, like beef rice and various pastries
7. The housekeeper is not only to praise, but also to solve the corresponding problems and considerate service
8. The overall taste of the food in the western restaurant is in line with the price. I like the big hamburger, curry beef rice and Kung Pao shrimp balls.
9. The top spray of the shower is large enough and the water pressure is high
10. The twin room can be made into a large bed of about three meters and the bedding is of high quality
11. The minibar is free and has various accessories

Next, let's talk about the areas that can be improved:
1. The overall reception capacity of the hotel has been improved. On the first day of check-in, there is only one western restaurant, which leads to extremely low efficiency in serving meals. However, the waiter can communicate effectively and try to solve the problem. When checking out, the front desk has already lined up for check-in.
2. As a parent-child hotel, it does not provide bed surrounds and the crib is only 90cm long
3. Some residents smoked in the room and opened the door without the corresponding staff to dissuade them. The smell of smoke in the corridor was very strong. This happened more than 3 times during the stay (in total, no more than 6 times in and out)
4. The overall sound insulation effect of the hotel is average. The sound in the corridor is easily transmitted into the house, and the noise of adjacent rooms (including the upper floor) will affect the room, so it is recommended to stay on the top floor
5. The ground of the children's playground is very slippery
6. The bathroom area is very small, and your elbows can easily hit the glass when you turn around and flush
7. The bathroom door has no damping and no vibration damping measures on the door frame. It is easy to smash the glass door when it is closed directly.
8. The sliding door of the bathroom cannot be closed tightly, and it is inconvenient for the baby to use after sleeping
9. There are too many people in Tangquan in the middle of the mountain, and there is absolutely no effect of private soup like the online picture (staying on weekdays and not on weekends), and some of the pools are under maintenance, and there are no blocking measures for non-reserved personnel. It is recommended to check in Reduce the number of appoin**ents during peak hours and arrange for corresponding personnel to guide to improve the experience
10. There is no free car wash service reviewed by others

When I found out that it was my birthday on the day I checked in, a birthday card was placed in the room and a beautiful cake was prepared. Helped me to book the dining room and so on. Very caring.
On the day of check-in, you also enjoy a free car brush service.
The hot spring is a small room on the north side. When I checked in, there were not many people. When I went to soak in the evening, I was the only one in the small room, which felt very good.
Just resumed dine-in when we moved in, the food and service were very good.

The overall layout of the room is good, but there is a lack of a necessary reclining chair. Personally, I think the morning meal is quite satisfactory. The pancakes and wontons are delicious. Next, let's talk about the very cool place. 1. The mountain climbing environment around the hotel, the mid-mountain hot springs, and the sports venues are very popular in my heart. 2. The hotel provides various activities for babies, and the children's playground is super invincible. The 2-story swimming pool is the most comfortable and the most suitable temperature among so many hotels I have been to. It is very suitable for babies. I must like it! 3.

The night before check-in, Ms. Luna Zhang, the housekeeper, called to confirm the information and asked if she liked to help book the experience program. She took the initiative to present a birthday cake when checking out. Mr. Gao Bo and Mr. Shi Fengming from the Security Affairs Depar**ent on the day of check-in also helped to scrub the vehicle. The hotel rooms are clean and comfortable, with all the necessary amenities. The food in the restaurant is fresh and tastes good. The hot spring is outdoor, and it is very comfortable to soak in the hot spring while watching the scenery. In the evening, I also experienced the salt steaming room of the health center. The warm and considerate care of the staff Ms. Meizi was impressive. All in all, I personally think this is a very good hot spring hotel, value for money, and highly recommended.

The housekeeper Nancy and the plum in the health center are super nice. They climbed the mountain and played badminton. Communication and gym can be experienced! The most comfortable day in the first half of 22 years is in the middle of the mountain.

üçÉEnvironment: The view is great, looking at it from the balcony, I thought it was in the Ritz-Carlton, Sanya~

The hot spring is on the mountain, and the feeling of looking at the mountain through the glass is very special.
There are various parent-child activities every day, which are very carefully arranged. Among them, I thought the bird nests would be recycled. I didn‚Äôt expect to go to the mountain and saw many bird nests that were hung before, and I instantly became full of goodwill.
Chinese restaurant and western restaurant taste good.

At that time, all public areas were not open due to the epidemic. This time it was considered a supplementary ticket. The hotel has complete facilities and excellent scenery, especially the outdoor hot spring located on the mountainside is a must-see attraction for Internet celebrities, and you can experience different scenery no matter day or night! In addition, the children's play center is definitely a super-class standard in a five-star hotel. It is even better than a professional children's playground. The place is very large! Trampoline ocean ball slides and a variety of kid-friendly toys. The facilities in the room are very complete, the decoration is exquisite, and the full set of L'Occitane's toiletries can be regarded as luxurious. Finally, the key point is to mention the service of the hotel. After the room was booked, our exclusive butler Luna took the initiative to contact me and informed me of some precautions and the rules for the use of the hotel area. On the day of check-in, we will confirm the arrival time, help bring our luggage from the parking lot to the guest room, introduce how to use the room facilities, and help to book hotel facilities during the check-in period. We take the initiative to help solve many problems, so that our whole family can stay at the hotel without any worries. Entertain and relax. In addition, two hotel staff, Gao Bo and Shi Fengming, took the initiative to help wash the car on the day we arrived at the store. Thank you very much, it made my car see the light again. Ms. plum also provided attentive service during our salt steaming process. To sum up, this half-mountain trip is almost perfect

msg:Because of the birthday, I chose to come to the Bay Banshan Hot Spring Hotel. Friends around me before will often recommend it, and it's worth it after coming here. When we arrived at the hotel on Sunday afternoon, as soon as we came in at the door and showed the health treasure, a special person would guide us into the parking lot. The parking lot is very large and very convenient. You can directly reach the front desk of the hotel by taking the elevator. There are staff in the parking lot to help guide the parking and enter the space, and later told me that the car can be cleaned for free, and the owner will be notified after cleaning. I am very grateful to Gao Bo and Shi Fengming, the staff of the Security Affairs Depar**ent, who are very serious and responsible. Secondly, when we checked in at the front desk, we upgraded our room, and because of my birthday, I arranged the room for me, which is very happy.

msg:I came here before the Spring Festival holiday in January this year. This time it was my father's birthday. Both times I chose a private soup room, and both times they were connected by Wang Na. The service was super good, and I was really satisfied with the arrangement! To be honest, this hotel in the middle of the mountain is a little expensive, but it is indeed expensive. From the layout of the hotel, the comfort of the bed, and the warm reception and service of the various service personnel, I think it is still very worthwhile to come here to relax and enjoy life. For families with children, this place is especially suitable. The playground is very large and clean. There are three big slides to satisfy different babies. When traveling in the playground, you can always find all kinds of entertainment equipment and surprises. Both Chinese and Western restaurants, the food tastes very good, definitely not just filling the stomach, it is really delicious. Living in the middle of the mountain, eating in the middle of the mountain, soaking in soup, mountain climbing, playground, awesome!

Here, you can enjoy the happiness of bathing in the hot spring on the mid-level. The hotel also provides badminton, basketball, table tennis, skating, and children's playground for a happy parent-child project. The most commendable thing is that they provide personal butler service and serve us throughout the whole process. I would like to thank Si Si for his warm and thoughtful service. I hope to stay here again next time.

Let's talk about the advantages first, the baby is really happy, a children's playground is enough to play for a long time, every day is not eating and sleeping, or playing in the children's playground. Xiao Yang Wangmei and Xiao Lin in the children's playground are serious and responsible, always watching them maintain the order of the playground and clean up the toys thrown by the children. During the stay, my housekeeper Zhang Xiaoying was very good and responded promptly to all the details. The large cotton clothes provided by the hotel are very warm, and a bathrobe and a cotton clothes can be used for a short stay outdoors in the subzero temperature without coldness. The western restaurant is open 24 hours a day, and pizza dolls love to eat.

Let‚Äôs talk about the disadvantages: first, the water pressure in the shower is unstable, switching between hot water and cold water; second, there is no shower cap for the washing products;

Looking forward to it. The transportation of the hotel is very convenient. It takes an hour and a half to drive from the city. After checking in, the housekeeper Crystal-L i thoughtfully helped to change the room. Knowing that we were visiting the hotel for the first time, he also worked overtime as a guide to lead our family to familiarize themselves with the main features of the hotel. We went all over the place to play, allowing us to quickly get to know the hotel. The second thing worth mentioning is that the children's playground in the hotel is very big. On weekdays, the children don't have much fun. They have to play every day for three consecutive days, but the room temperature in the playground is not too high, so the children need to wear more clothes; the third hotel's special hot spring experience is very good Well, there are 13 pools on the mountain. If the weather is good, it will not feel cold at all, and the outdoor air will not feel stuffy. If you go in the afternoon, you can enjoy the sunset while soaking in the hot springs. And the tabletops are all competition-level standards and very professional; the afternoon tea in the travel cake box presented by the fifth hotel tastes good and the shape is also online; Relax. In short, the mid-levels of the bay are worth visiting againüëç

msg:The package bought on Double Eleven is actually available on Saturday, and it is rare to get a price increase! It's a pity that the appoin**ent is late, and I can only make an appoin**ent on Sunday, but it's okay, the next day is Valentine's Day, and the children haven't started school yet, so just ask for one day of annual leave.
Before departure, I found that there was a lot of snow, and I was a little hesitant to go, but in the end, it turned out to be a very good itinerary!
First of all, the hardware of the hotel is very good. The interior of the room is very luxurious. There are also safes, refrigerators and bathtubs. Food and drink in the refrigerator are free. From the balcony, you can also see the snow scene of the hot spring soup house on the opposite side of the mountain, which is very beautiful!
The hotel has very rich supporting entertainment facilities. The air-filled stadium has 5 badminton courts, 1 full-court basketball court, 2 table tennis tables; there is also a small ice skating rink outside the stadium; children can go to the children's playground, but my family My son is older, and he is not interested in this anymore. He wants to climb the mountain, but because of the heavy snow, he can't make it. Finally, let's talk about the key point - hot springs, according to the zodiac, there are 12 soup houses, each with different formulas and effects. Each soup house has toilets, warm lights, seats for rest, racks for clothes, and they are all semi-open. , you can see the outside scenery. Bring a drink, soak in the hot spring for a while, and drink a cool drink is very refreshing! On the mountain road of the hot spring, no matter the snow scene during the day or the lights at night, it is also very beautiful.
For dinner at a western restaurant in the evening, the package includes steak, pasta, Hainanese chicken rice, salad, fruit, and beef soup. A family of three will definitely be full, and the taste is also very good. There are not many people in the western restaurant, there is no need to queue, and there are also Asian dishes suitable for us, curry rice, ramen and so on.
The breakfast on the second day was also very good. Although there were many people, it was very orderly under the arrangement of the on-site staff. All kinds of delicious food can be picked up at will, in addition to ready-made noodles, hot dishes, meat, beverages, porridge, tofu brain, as well as freshly made noodles and pancakes, children are also full.
Special praise to our housekeeper Nancy, who contacted me the day before departure, introduced the hotel facilities and the reservation process of various projects to me, answered many of my questions, and made me have a clear plan for the itinerary, otherwise But you will miss out on a lot of fun. After we checked in, we came to the room to introduce the facilities in the room to us. It was really warm and considerate, and the service attitude was full!
This is a very satisfying trip. It is worthy of being the No.1 in Beijing Hot Spring Hotel. The child said, I will come later! Hahaha

msg:In the wake of winter vacation, the whole family went to the bay peninsula for a hot spring trip. After Ctrip booked the hotel, on the afternoon of the day before check-in, the housekeeper Han Yu made a phone call to introduce the hotel and ask about the needs. I suggested that I hope that the room should be arranged as high floors as possible without blocking, and I made an appoin**ent for the project time I hope to experience in the next two days, and Xiao Han made the arrangements one by one.
The next afternoon, I drove to the hotel. After the car was parked in the underground garage, Xiao Han arranged for the car to be washed again. Two car wash masters, Fu Wensheng and Hu Yu, cleaned the car.
During check-in, I encountered some episodes and waited for half an hour. During this period, Xiao Han kept trying his best to coordinate, and finally got his wish to live in a room with a view on the sixth floor.
The overall size of the double room is not large, and the decoration style is slightly different from the expected luxury hotel, but all the service staff encountered during the period were smiling and responsive, which made people feel very warm, and the five-star service deserved its name.
Because the 12-year-old child is relatively old, we didn't go to the children's playground, except for the hot springs, the most common place to go is the gymnasium. There are two basketball courts and five badminton courts in the gymnasium, which are enough for guests. The service staff of the gym, Master Guo and intern Zuo Yunpeng, were also very enthusiastic and offered services such as mineral water. The children had a great time.
During the period, I ate dinner at the hotel's Chinese restaurant and western restaurant. The western restaurant tasted average, and the steak was not tender. Compared with the Chinese restaurant, the taste was better. Fish head cakes and boiled beef are recommended.
Tips: You can use the off-peak travel strategy for hot springs on weekends. 4-6 pm is the peak period. When we go to the hot springs at 12:30 noon the next day, there is no one at all, and all the pools are randomly selected. The milk pool is located at the highest point, and the landscape is also the best, which is recommended.

During this period, I also responded to my inquiries and needs. I would like to give Xiaoli butler a thumbs up here! For the first time, I felt the hotel service of Banshan Hot Spring.

The hotel I went to on Valentine's Day was very crowded but still orderly. One day in advance, a service specialist (Ke Xin) specially communicated the situation and needs of the guests, and provided online services throughout the whole process, which was very attentive. Although there are many guests, the 12 pools do not have exclusive trea**ent, but they are not crowded. Basically, there are about two people in one pool. It is really not too cold to go to the outdoor swimming pool and put on the cotton vest provided by the hotel. It is a good route to pass through the door of the swimming pool on the second floor. From 5:00 to 5:30 in February, you can watch the sunset while soaking in the soup. The food in the western restaurant tastes good. The sea, land and air hamburger set is recommended. There are also large pieces of lobster meat in the super large. The Chinese restaurant is staggered to eat (after 8 o'clock), and the food is served quickly without waiting for a table. The taste is quite satisfactory, and the price is expensive. Went to the children's center twice, the room temperature was low, the children didn't feel sweaty, adults need to wear more clothes, the service staff were very enthusiastic (thanks to Haijiao and Wang Mei) and gave them small toys. Sports venues are also well booked, with rackets and badminton bills available. If you go after 10 o'clock for breakfast, you don't have to wait for a table, but the meal closes at 10:30. Try to take it at one time, and the meal is very punctual üòÇ, just eat like that. The overall feeling of the hotel is okay, but the scale is slightly smaller than expected, and the luxury level is slightly different from the price üòÑ

msg:January was the 9th anniversary of my husband and I getting the certificate, and just in time for my daughter‚Äôs winter vacation, I made a reservation at the Bay Half-Levels Hotel. Fortunately, it was neither affected by the epidemic nor blocked the road after the snow.
The first snow of 2022 fell in Beijing on January 20. On the morning of the check-in day, I received a phone call from the hotel's housekeeper, Luna. I kindly reminded her that if you arrive early, you can contact her to go to the hotel's entertainment facilities to play, and then check in after the time is almost up. She also sent the location of the hotel via WeChat, and reminded her that it was snowing. Slippery roads, drive carefully.
When I was about to arrive, I contacted the butler Luna again and learned that I could drive directly to the hotel lobby halfway up the mountain. When my daughter and I got off the bus, the housekeeper was already waiting in the lobby. The security led her husband down the basement. There are already staff in the basement waiting to greet you in advance, and provide a free service of washing the appearance of the vehicle for the staying guests. When my husband was unloading his luggage, a master had already come over with a bucket. The master who greeted me asked my husband if he had much luggage and whether he needed to push a luggage cart. The husband said no, so the master led the husband all the way to the lobby. The husband claims to have a strong memory, and at a glance, the masters who wash and lead the car at Gongpai seem to be called Gao Bo and Shi Fengming.
Since it was not a weekend, there were not many people in the hotel. After checking in, the butler led the way to the guest room and introduced the hotel facilities while walking.
Putting down the luggage in the guest room, the girl can't wait to play. So the housekeeper took him all the way to the children's playground. Here, soft building blocks, tree house-shaped climbing frames, three-tiered large climbing frames, ocean balls, trampolines, slides, and various recreational facilities are particularly abundant. I finally persuaded my daughter to go to the hot springs first, and then come back tomorrow, and she reluctantly left.
When we returned to the guest room to change our swimsuits, we suddenly heard the doorbell. It turned out that the hotel knew that we had reserved a room for our wedding anniversary, and gave us a cake for the anniversary. There were also swans and rose petals made of bath towels on the bed. As soon as there was a cake, the girl immediately got motivated, and after eating half of the cake, she was satisfied to go to the hot spring.
I have to say that the hotel is really big, and I walked all the way to the swimming pool and hot spring area under the guidance of the housekeeper.
The soup in the snow has a different mood. The water temperature of the soup pool is just right, and the children will not feel hot. But there are children around, I didn't dare to soak for too long. We played in the indoor swimming pool (both wading pools are more comfortable temperature) for a long time before moving to the Chinese restaurant for dinner.
Chinese restaurant, the quality is acceptable, the price is not high. The food is mediocre, nothing special.
After dinner, we walked on the snow and walked around. When it was time to make an appoin**ent, we went to the fitness center. Maybe because there are not many people on non-weekends, when we went, there was no one in the fitness center. Although the appoin**ent is badminton, table tennis, badminton, and basketball are all free to play. With the help of my daughter, I easily defeated my husband. Slightly sweating, the amount of exercise is just right...
Turning around, the buffet breakfast is rich and of good quality. I wanted to go ice skating after breakfast, but unfortunately the snow was still falling, and the hotel's outdoor ice rink was not open for safety reasons.
After looking around, the number of guests on the weekends increased significantly. I thought that the soup pool was overcrowded, so I stopped going. Coming to the children's paradise again is to follow my daughter's wish.
One morning, the girl was still unsure. Greeted Luna in advance and changed to check out at 1:00. We played until it was time for us to check out, and the daughter still did not leave, so she entrusted her to two staff members, Haijiao and Wang Mei, in the paradise. When we checked out and came back, the girl was still playing... Before leaving, the staff of the park enthusiastically gave her little toys.
In general, the Gulf Peninsula is really one of the best parent-child hotels in Beijing, and it is suitable for visiting in spring, summer, autumn and winter. Because of the snow this time, for safety reasons, I did not go climbing this time. When the weather is warm, you can take the baby to see the mountain view and climb the plank road.

Service is very good. Before check-in, the housekeeper Li Fang specially contacted me to understand my needs, introduced various activities and facilities of the hotel in detail, and helped me book various activities. After I checked in, I came to the lobby to greet me, and took my child to the children's activity area, which was very warm and thoughtful. Xiao He from the Children's Activity Center is very patient and kind. He brings the children to do activities together. My second child is relatively young, and Xiao He has always been very patient. Xiao Yang from the children's club was also very enthusiastic. He helped watch the children when the adults left, and gave the children small gifts when they left. The service staff encountered along the way are also friendly.
The room is very good, big and spacious, the facilities are very new, and the hygiene is also done well. The equipment is L'Occitane, and the bath in the swimming fitness center is Jurlique.
The hot spring in the middle of the mountain is the biggest feature. It is unforgettable to go to the highest hot spring pool in the evening. The unobstructed scenery and the last sunset are very beautiful.
The breakfast is rich and varied.
The only problem is that there are a lot of people, but this also shows the popularity of this hotel.
Overall, it is a veritable high-end hotel, and it is not difficult to explain why the basic room types of more than 2,000 per night on weekdays are still full.

The coaches come to the ice rink to accompany the children in skating, and even wear protective gear. The biggest feature is that there are many hot spring pools, and the retreats are distributed in the middle of the mountain, and the viewing effect is very good. Salt steam room, Bianstone therapy is novel, the eldest sister's service is particularly warm and thoughtful, and the delivery of water and towels is very considerate.

msg:I started planning a hot spring tour very early before the Spring Festival. At first, I felt that the price of this hotel was a bit expensive. Later, we received a notice a month ago that the last hotel booked was specially requisitioned, so we booked this one. The experience is still very good! Because there are old people and young children, the hotel butler contacted us the day before departure and asked for some itinerary in advance. Susan's butler was very thoughtful. When she arrived at the hotel, she waited in the lobby. The rooms were arranged in the same area, upstairs and downstairs. Very convenient (one is a private soup room, the other is a twin room). Basically, other service staff will take the initiative to greet the guests when they encounter them, and give way to the guests to pass first. The experience is very good.
Guest room: The decoration is very luxurious. After we arrived, several service staff in the guest room were very enthusiastic. Xiao Han and Wang Jinrong (the name seemed to sound like this) were busy and asked us what we needed, and we would find them if we needed anything. The preparation of the imperial concubine's couch was also arranged by Susan Xiaohan and the others.
Private soup: I read on the Internet that it might not be private enough, but when I got there, it was quite private. There is a big awning on the private soup, which should prevent that. of. However, because it is open air, and the family next to it is also soaking in private soup, the chatter can be heard, and the problem is not too big.
Entertainment: I wanted to make an appoin**ent for badminton in the gym the night before, but it was so popular that I couldn't make an appoin**ent. Later, I finally made an appoin**ent at 11:00 noon, and went to have a look. It seems that the venue is not fully occupied, and there is also a venue to play basketball even if there is no appoin**ent.
Hot springs: Personally, I like all kinds of hot springs on the mountainside. After changing into a warm swimsuit, I walked over there. The road is a little cold, but I can bear it. The old man didn't dare to take him there, so he soaked in the house. There are many soup pools on the mountain, which are much larger than private soups. There are hair-raising and various medicinal baths. I can‚Äôt remember the names clearly. I thought the milk bath was milky white. After soaking in the hot spring, it's not cold at all. The bathrobe is a little wet and a little cold. It's okay to wear more if you are weak.
Others: In addition to the hot spring's favorite Himalayan salt steaming and anvil stone dry steaming, the quality of sleep at night has improved.
In comparison, the breakfast is rich in variety, but some tastes need to be improved. Fried dough sticks, pancakes, fruit and haggis soup are all good, personal taste is different.
Overall, I am satisfied, the service is good, and the hot spring is good. Have a chance to play again.

Before leaving, the housekeeper Sally took the initiative to call and add WeChat. Knowing that she was bringing children, she took the initiative to prepare a whole set of children's supplies. All questions were answered in a timely manner and the service was very attentive. They also gave the children a very delicious cake. Thanks sally and room supervisor Han Yu. I went the day before New Year's Eve, and I didn't come to wash the car. I didn't expect to take the initiative to wash the car when it was parked in the basement. Special thanks to Ren Liangliang and Liu Wuchou of the Security Affairs Depar**ent for this, I am very satisfied with the car wash. In the evening, there were some snowflakes, soaked in hot springs, and played badminton. Before leaving, I did steaming again, maybe in the morning. There were few people and almost reserved the venue. Ms. Sun's service was also very good. She delivered water during the period and observed whether the temperature was suitable.

msg:During the holiday before the Spring Festival, I came to check in the Internet celebrity parent-child hotel. To sum up in one sentence, it is very suitable for parent-child and couple travel. It will be better to arrange more than 2 nights of experience.
    1. The room. The hotel is built on a mountain, the north wing is high and the south wing is low, so the floors will be strange. The first floor of the north wing is the fifth floor of the south wing, which is also the lobby of the hotel. We live in Hao double facing the mountain back, there is no scenery. If you have requirements for scenery, it is best to choose a garden view room. The toilet is separated from wet and dry, and each functional area is separated, and the toto washlet is used. Each room has a small balcony, with chairs and coffee tables on the balcony, which is very comfortable in summer. The double bed is 1.35 meters, so families with two children have no pressure. The only downside is that the room is a bit small and cramped. The drying rack is also relatively small and can only be placed in the room in winter, so it takes up more space.
    2. Facilities. The entertainment facilities in the north wing are relatively concentrated, with hot springs, swimming pools, gymnasiums, ice skating rinks, and breakfast restaurants in the north wing, and children's playgrounds in the south wing. Generally speaking, it is more convenient to live in the North Wing. The hot spring is halfway up the mountain, with a slightly larger pool and several separate small pools, each of which has water bathing facilities. The swimming pool has 2 entertainment pools with high temperature (the temperature is not the same, like a hot spring) and a non-standard swimming pool. Gymnasium facilities are professional, reservations are required, and there are fewer people after 3 o'clock in the afternoon.
    3. Services. Contact the customer service manager in advance to confirm the needs and provide one-to-one service. There are really a lot of people in the hotel, and the procedures are all very neat, but you have to basically get the room after 3 o'clock. The staff of various entertainment facilities are very attentive and enthusiastic, of course, except for the uncle in the gym who is louder, but he is also kind. After reading a lot of reviews, there are free car washes in the underground parking lot. After arriving, I found that the people who can park in the underground parking lot are all lucky. Most cars can only be crowded on the ground, driveways and other locations.
    4. Dining. Breakfast is in the cafe. After 9 o'clock, there are really many people. The people who guide are still very professional, and the overall queue time is not too long. There is actually salmon sashimi for breakfast, which is indeed arrogant. Lunch and dinner can be solved in cafes and Chinese restaurants. The cafe has some light meals. I tried beef noodles (the beef is really big), curry beef brisket set (good taste, big beef), pasta, Big Mac Burgers (to be honest, the photos look good and the taste is average). There are so many people in the Chinese restaurant that you have to queue up if you go late. I tried fish head puff pastry, spicy chicken, etc. The taste is okay, but the price is too beautiful.
    This trip was arranged for 3 nights in the middle of the mountain. In the middle, I went to the Nanshan Ski Resort (which is great), and then climbed the mountain, hot springs, children's playground, badminton, basketball, skating, swimming, and every day was very fulfilling. Sometimes children still feel unfulfilled.
     Finally, a little suggestion, arrange a small supermarket. In the evening, it is extremely inconvenient to buy milk, beer, and small snacks.

The hotel we arrived in advance gave us good advice and helped the children play in advance. The project was very attentive and thoughtful throughout the whole process. This trip also brought the birthday earlier. The family gave us a surprise. Crystal didn‚Äôt know where to know it. In the evening, they specially sent red wine üç∑ü§©, very unexpected, really special surprise. What a lovely little housekeeperüòÜ, because of your caring, although there are some minor flaws in the itinerary, I will still choose our hotel in the future, and I would also like to praise "Wang Mei" and "Hai Jiao" in the children's park, who will pay attention to children The needs of the children, the children had a good time, and they also gave gifts to the children before leaving, and the children liked it very much.
But here I still want to talk about the hygiene situation that I am more concerned about, because our hotel is marked as a five-star hotel, and we have booked a children's theme room. The hygiene should be done more thoroughly. There are several hygiene problems found. It is a problem that should not arise, and the hotel should pay attention to it.
After communicating with the housekeeper again, I came to clean again, but when I returned to the room again, there were still unresolved hygiene issues, and I contacted the housekeeper Crystal again, and came to deal with it again.
Because of this hygiene problem, I have some regrets for this tripüôÅ
Finally, I would like to thank the staff of our Chinese restaurant. They kindly took children's tableware and bibs for Erbao. They were very considerate and the meal was delicious. They also gave noodles. Thank you

Play: The hot springs are good and many, and I didn‚Äôt take the children for a while. The children‚Äôs playground is very good. There are usually few people. Every staff member is very enthusiastic. It is good to take paper and water for the children.
It is recommended that if you are bringing a child to the house, you can prepare a hand washing stool and a small toilet
Overall pretty good, the service staff are very enthusiastic, will come again if there is a chance

The exclusive housekeeper Jiang Hao gave a delayed check-out and answered various questions on WeChat at any time. The outdoor hot spring is still quite cold from changing clothes to walking to the hot spring, so wear more. The trampoline in the children's paradise is a big favorite of children. Haijiao not only gave small gifts, but also took the initiative to introduce the activities of the next day. Guo Jianli from the gym gave badminton and small gifts. Back in the room, I received a box of water and 2 bags of L'Occitane samples from Shao Qi, Xiao Fanqing and Yu Guizhen. I experienced the salt steaming and Bianstone energy room. It was not as hot as I imagined, and it was very comfortable. The fish head bubble cake in the Chinese restaurant is very delicious, and children love it very much. Afterwards, the children experienced the little chef and made a steamer dumpling by themselves. I didn't notice the small print fee reminder when making an appoin**ent, and after communicating with the housekeeper, they refunded me the money. When I left, I found the car had been washed. Really considerate service throughout the whole process, worthy of the expensive price.

msg:I have been in love with the hotel for a long time, and I finally caught up with the end of the year when I was not busy with work and brought my baby to play around.
First of all, the hotel as a whole is relatively high-end. From the moment I entered the door, the service staff were very polite and guided me to park underground, check in at the hotel, and the waiter helped me with my luggage to the room. Because the housekeeper Han Yu contacted me the day before and learned about the people and needs of the occupants, so when I got to the room, I found that the details of the previous communication were done. The children's supplies, pedals, and toilet seat were already in the room. This is still Some surprises. Wang Jinrong, the waiter corresponding to the room, was also very considerate. Knowing that we had children, he prepared extra mineral water and left a message.
Because of the current epidemic, you need to make an appoin**ent to go to public places. You can make an appoin**ent yourself, or you can contact the housekeeper to help you make an appoin**ent at any time.
The hotel's main hot spring is very special. Because of the middle of the week, we go to the hot spring in the afternoon and evening. Although it is public, it is basically possible for a family to do one soup. The soup pools have different themes and different water temperatures. However, if the child is too young, it is still more suitable for the temperature of the pool water. The pool is also big and the water is relatively clean. There was also an episode when I was swimming. A staff member called me and cleaned the exterior of the car for free. I would also like to thank Ren Liangliang and Liu Wu Chou.
Dinner at the hotel at night, the price is relatively high, but the taste is okay, and the amount of key dishes is really big! After dinner, I took the children to the children's playground. The temperature was a bit low. The adults provided hotel slippers. The room was absolutely big! Some are suitable for 5-12 year olds, and some are younger. The children are very happy. Before leaving, the waiter Hai Jiao also gave the child a button sticker, saying that if the child is young, we may not take her to the event. So give a small gift. Also told us that we can continue to play here after we check out.
Breakfast is eaten in a western restaurant. There are many kinds. There are all kinds of Chinese and western-style cold cuts and fruits. The taste is not evaluated, but there are always some, and it feels like a sincere self-service.
The experience of these two days and one night is very good. The hardware and software of the hotel have passed the test. Although the service staff is indeed too enthusiastic, maybe it is mainly to give a good review, but the service is in place, and we can all understand it. After all, it is the end of the year, and everyone not easy
The only downside of the hotel may be the corridors. The public areas in the lobby are too cold, which is not friendly to children. After all, we go in and out of the hot springs to swim, and we are more worried that the children will catch a cold, although the rooms provide cotton vests. But it is better to raise the overall room temperature, after all, is it a parent-child hotel?
All in all, I will come again with my family in the future, highly recommended!

On the first day of check-in, Miss Sally called me and asked me what time I would check in, if there were any children, and if there were any special requirements for check-in, which made me feel very warm! Early the next morning, she sent another WeChat message saying that the room had been reserved for me and could be moved in at any time. She also asked me to park the car in the ba*****t and contacted the car wash for me to clean the car! We arrived at the hotel in the afternoon. Miss Sally was waiting for us in the lobby. After checking in, she took us to the room in person, and sent me the timetable of all the open projects in the hotel, so that I could take my children and not miss everything in the hotel. Project experience! During the stay, she will also ask us whether we need to send water, for fear that the children will be thirsty in the hot spring! In the evening, we will warmly remind us of the peak time for breakfast the next day. If you contact us, you can go to breakfast at off-peak hours! The hotel's breakfast has a complete variety and tastes good, and the children are very satisfied with it! Oh, by the way, because we checked in too late the day before, Sally was afraid that our children would not experience the project, so Sally helped us to delay the check-out time so that the children could have enough fun! When we checked out and left the hotel, two masters, Gao Bo and Shi Fengming, had already wiped the car clean. The two masters were very serious people at first sight. They were clean and 360 degrees without dead ends. This time I stayed here. The children are very happy to play, thank you Sally for taking care of us, you have worked hard!

If there is a problem, we will solve it as soon as possible. We ordered a takeaway at around 8:30 in the evening, and the concierge will take us to the gate of the hotel to pick it up. Meal, and then send it back to us, thank you all. Finally, it should be said that Wang Haijiao, the staff member of the children's playground, took good care of every little friend with enthusiasm and responsibility, and took the initiative to remind guests to wear masks over and over again. Girls like her very much. All in all, it was a good experience to choose the Mid-Levels Hot Spring Hotel decisively this time. I will come back when I have time.

msg:The 5-star hot spring hotel is located in the middle of the mountain in Miyun, Beijing. I am satisfied in every aspect. The hotel has two free parking lots on the ground and underground. The underground parking lot has elevators directly to the lobby for check-in. After checking in, the housekeeper Han Huayu received us to the room and introduced some functions and projects of the room and the hotel. We added WeChat with the housekeeper, and you can consult if you have any questions you don‚Äôt understand. Our butler Han Huayu's service attitude is very professional and enthusiastic. He took the initiative to help us reserve a restaurant location, inform us of various items available in the gym, hot spring clothing and business hours, etc., knowing that we are going to take a hot spring and a spa the next day. At that time, he helped us to delay part of the check-out time, as well as the small snacks and hot milk before going to bed. I was touched by everything. Make the originally pleasant trip more thoughtful and surprising. In addition to the high quality of the service staff, many details of the hotel also reflect the 5-star quality, clean and smooth water, a bath with stable pressure and strong water flow, soft beds and a mini bar for drinking, L'Occitane's toiletries, let us get a good deal of relaxation. The Banshan Hot Spring, which is directly accessible by a straight ladder, has 12 separate hot spring rooms, with a wide view and comfortable water temperature. It is very comfortable to avoid the peak period of people. Free hot black tea is provided around the hot spring to replenish water. It is recommended for those who like to soak in soup. friends. The gym is big, warm, bright, basketball, badminton, table tennis can be rented, and the equipment is well maintained. We had a pleasant holiday. If there is anything wrong, it is that the consumption is much more expensive than other hot spring hotels, such as Gubeizhiguang, Jingzhihu, and the old-fashioned Jiuhua Wendu Water City. . But it‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt spend money. The equipment and services in the bay area are the best in my hot spring hotel in Beijing. In terms of food and drinks, if you feel that the price/performance ratio is not high, you can bring your own needs. Good reviews, will come again next time with my family.

Although it was not a weekend or holiday, there were a lot of people. There are more than a dozen public baths on the mountainside. You can soak and watch the scenery outside. We went there at 5 o'clock in the afternoon after swimming. There were a lot of people in each pool. After experiencing one, we went back to our room for private bathing. Go to the soupüòä. The food in the western restaurant is also not bad, next time I have the opportunity to experience another restaurant. Sally Gao Yanling from the front office was called to praise.

Because the child booked a themed room of the submarine column for his birthday, the deputy manager of the lobby, Jiang Hao, called to ask if there was any need for check-in and told him that it was the child‚Äôs birthday, so he arranged the birthday decoration carefully. Thank you very much! There are also handwritten birthday cards and cakes by service ambassador Feifei and Zhou Fang! It's really hard!

High-quality service is in the words of every staff member, in every smiley face, as they themselves said, "I hope you can experience an unprecedented value-for-money experience". Each of them has done it with action! Thank you so much for meeting them during this trip, which made us very unforgettable!
Let's talk about hotel facilities
The 12 hot spring pools in the middle of the mountain are not very big. When there are a lot of people, it is a bit like cooking dumplings but the scenery is really good. The pools built in Yanshan need to climb the steps of the mountain road. Old people with bad legs and children are not too small. The heated spa pool suitable for the swimming pool area is quite suitable for children to swim and play in the children‚Äôs playground area can also accommodate many children
Generally speaking, it is really suitable for bringing parents and children to play. The parent-child hotel is well established
In short, the service details reflect the temperature of the hotel. Amway gave it to friends while playing and will come again~

msg:As a mother, I feel very sad to post this comment. It was originally a happy Chris**as vacation for children. During the normal walk in the hotel swimming pool, because there was no anti-slip mat beside the hotel swimming pool, he fell on the marble and tore his chin and required stitches. Two days have passed since the incident happened. The child cannot open his mouth to eat and can only eat soft liquid food. He has repeatedly communicated with the hotel. After what happened, the hotel carried out simple disinfection and put a band-aid on the child after learning that he was injured. Then I was asked to take him to the hospital for trea**ent. The police retrieved the surveillance video from the time. From the video, the child came ashore from the swimming pool and did not run, jump, push, or walk normally. I made my simple demands: 1. Please take protective measures to prevent the situation from happening again. 2. Please compensate me for medical expenses. 3. Please give the child a holiday. No compensation was requested. The hotel replied to me yesterday that they would give me a free room for three days without compensating for medical expenses. As a regular customer of the hotel, I feel chilled by the hotel's unprofessional and irresponsible attitude. Last night, Ctrip VIP customer service called to inquire about this matter. Thank you Ctrip.com for your concern. I also ask you to objectively judge this matter based on professional hotel emergency response plan data. As a customer, whether my request is excessive. After thinking over and over again, I posted the picture online, just to remind future guests that as a hotel that focuses on family vacations, parents must not have the same situation as us when taking their children to stay. Except for the swimming pool, in winter It was freezing outside and the road up the mountain to the hot springs was slippery. A girl suffered a full-thickness tear of 2cm on her face and chin. The photos were too bloody and were not posted online. I hope no more mothers will experience the blame I feel towards myself now.

Although the rooms are full, I saw a long queue at the Western restaurant for breakfast, so I must get up early. It is recommended that the changing rooms in the swimming pool improve the service level, such as providing pockets for wet swimsuits, which are not expensive. Other hotels, especially those with hot spring facilities, have pockets. In addition, it needs to be pointed out that the cleaning staff in the women's locker room are rude and deliberately stare at the guests changing clothes. After observing for a while, I found that it was intentional (the young cleaning staff). It is very rude. I hope the hotel will take it seriously and change it to a matching hotel. Class staff!

The hotel also carefully prepares a cotton waistcoat. I personally like that waistcoat. . . The hot spring is also very comfortable, the view of the pool is also beautiful, and brown sugar ginger tea is also prepared. . . I like the spaghetti in western restaurants. I ordered a pasta, a Bak Kut Teh set meal, and a Hainanese chicken rice. I personally think that the soy sauce in the Bak Kut Teh should be paired with the soy sauce in the Hainanese chicken rice. (It‚Äôs just a suggestion, I hope the chef will try it.) The facilities in the children‚Äôs room are definitely the best facilities in the hotel I‚Äôve been to. They are almost able to catch up with the meland. As for the health center, I will come next time. I will definitely make an appoin**ent at the spa.

Real-name praise recommends our housekeeper Miss Nancy! We worked hard to arrange our hotel throughout the whole process, actively helped us ask for car wash information, personally went to the ba*****t to help us confirm the parking space, took the initiative to help us apply for late check-out, and sent us hot milk in the evening. It was really good enough. Service! Like like like!

Let's talk about the location first: Located in Miyun District, it is directly accessible by navigation, the road is very easy to walk, and the location is also easy to find. After you arrive, there are ground parking spaces and underground garages. From the ba*****t, you can take the elevator directly to the lobby. All parking is free of charge.

Room: Although there is no photo, but like the official photos, it can be seen that the hotel is very new, with all smart home appliances controlled by ipad, and the decoration style and layout are also very high-end. In addition, fruits are welcome, and our package includes all the mini bars in the room. free! Although it is a twin room, the bed is very large and soft, and it is very comfortable to sleep. It is no problem for two people to sleep.

Hot springs: The hot springs are really cool! It is recommended to change clothes in the room. The room is thoughtfully prepared with a down jacket and put it outside the bathrobe. Go outside and take the elevator directly to the hot spring in the middle of the mountain. I did not count carefully. There are many pools, and each pool has a separate bathroom. When we went there were few people, basically we were in the pool. It was very refreshing to watch the sunset glow in the hot springs on the mountain. The mountain also provides free hot drinks intimately, these details are really amazing.

The next morning we went to climb the mountain behind the hotel. The mountain was not big and the road was well repaired. As the best choice for morning exercise, it was not too tired and just reached the standard of exercise.

Finally, I would like to praise Liu Guochun and Feng Xiangguo of the Ministry of Safety Affairs in real names for washing our car for free during our parking period! Real-name praise! !

For a perfect hot spring vacation, you will no longer have to worry about choosing where to go in the future, just arrange it directly at the Bay Mid-Levels Hot Spring Hotel!

The children's playground was also very hygienic, and it tasted good after eating in the Chinese restaurant.

From check-in, waiting in the underground parking lot and providing car washing services, to the service center‚Äôs intimate and rapid water injection and cleaning for many times, to the small gifts presented by L‚ÄôOccitane when you leave, you can see that it is different from other five-star hotels. Service and user-focused vacation experience.

I experienced sunny, rainy, and snowy days respectively for three days. Under different weather, with the scenery and hot springs, it is a special experience. It is recommended that if you don‚Äôt care about the price and have children, go to the private soup room without your head, especially if you don‚Äôt want to go out at night and want to play with the whole family, the private soup can bring you a completely different experience.

We usually go to the outdoor hot springs at noon, especially on Saturdays and Sundays. Although the hotel is crowded, there are almost no people in the outdoor hot springs at that time. After brunch at 11 o'clock, we go outdoors around 12 o'clock. It is completely private. Experience.

Although there are a lot of people in the children's center, fortunately, the place is spacious. The children play with their friends and parents have a lot of relaxation time. Hotel dining is unexpectedly good. The sirloin in the dinner set is tender and the breakfast is rich in variety. My daughter-in-law did a spa for 2 days, and the evaluation method was professional. Although the price is not cheap, it is still worth the money. After finishing the work, I gave a fitness meal again, let us have another arrogant one at midnight~

In summary, although the gym, swimming pool, and sports center were not open this time due to the epidemic, the hot springs, private baths and the children‚Äôs playground still made the schedule rich and not monotonous. The hotel also arranged a lot of activities for children, and my daughters participated In addition to drawing and making cakes, it adds a lot of entertainment experience. I believe that with the opening of sports facilities in the future, the hotel experience will also take a step forward.

Although it is the first time, I have no brains to repurchase the next trip. Now it‚Äôs just in time for the Double Eleven event in the hotel. It‚Äôs a bargain to order room coupons from the official WeChat account. I don‚Äôt care about the cost of more than 1,000 more than the event. Hahaha~

Finally, I sincerely thank all the staff of the hotel for their caring service, Master Guo Yanzheng in the parking lot for his warm guidance, car wash, the intimate private soup cleaning and disinfection of Didier wang, Feifei, Zhou Fang in the guest room, and the massage by Xiao Li in the health center and another one. The teacher (my daughter-in-law does not remember, sorry) professional massage.

Looking forward to seeing you next time~

Ps. I hope the hotel can add some clothes to the outdoor staff. The weather has changed suddenly in the past two days. Outdoor staff such as door guidance and private soup cleaning feel that the clothes are still too thin.

msg:I decided to come to the hot springs during the last few days of the November holiday. I heard that the experience here is good but the price is expensive. We staggered the holidays a little bit. The price dropped a little and there were not many people. I felt it was very worthwhile. happy.

üöó Transportation: It is very convenient to come from Shunyi over an hour, there is no traffic jam, there is an underground parking lot on the ground, and it is close to the fish street.

üçÉEnvironment: The environment in the middle of the mountain is good, with fresh air and wild flowers everywhere. There is a hiking trail behind, take 2 children down the whole journey for an hour and a half, which is slightly challenging, the highest point is more than 200 meters above sea level. What's interesting is that the sites are named after the planets, so that children are interested in walking.

Hot springs: Several hot spring pools are in the middle of the mountain. You can go up directly from the swimming pool by elevator. The elderly can take a bath in the following pools if it is inconvenient to climb the steps. Except for a large pool that is closed with glass, the others are half open. The temperature of the pools is not too good. Similarly, it is recommended that the temperature of the green tea pool is not so high, and the temperature of the top milk pool is also suitable. The water is white, and the pool cannot be maintained every day. It is better when there are not many people. It is basically a private bath to find a pool with no one. If there are too many people, I might choose a room with private bath. But the advantage of the public hot spring is that the scenery is very good. I saw the sunset in the hot spring pool on the first day and it was beautiful.

Meals: The hotel has a western restaurant and a Chinese restaurant. Breakfast is very rich in the western restaurant. Dandan noodles are my favorite. Children like chicken soup and wontons, and waffles are crispy. The prices of the two restaurants are not low, but the taste is okay. The Hainanese chicken rice in the western restaurant is amazing, and the bread in the burger is very fragrant.

Activity: The hotel has a large children's playground. I started to worry about what to do if only one child is free and two children are free when booking a room. In fact, it doesn't matter. You can enter the room. However, my child went there once when he was older. You can play table tennis, badminton, and basketball in the air film gymnasium. You need to make an appoin**ent in advance. We bring badminton (because you have done homework haha) otherwise it will cost money, and other rackets are free. I am addicted to sports every day. The master Guo Jianli of the gymnasium Especially good, take the initiative to bring us towels and mineral water, also very talkative. In addition, there are parent-child activities to participate in every day. We participated in a small kitchen to make doughnuts (material fees are required), hand-painted fans, pottery experience (fees apply), especially the handwork and pottery where Mr. He and Mr. Li It‚Äôs very good for children. Both children of pottery art made it according to the money received by one child. Before leaving, Teacher He remembered that the child liked a building block when we came to do the handicraft the day before. There are small pictures and text drawn by the teacher, which is very touched.

üîîService: Good service should be the highlight here. There are welcome fruits in the room, food in the refrigerator is free, and 5100 mineral water is available at any time in unlimited quantities. Sally in the front office is the butler who is in charge of receiving us. At the beginning, I added WeChat. After that, I can answer the questions promptly and enthusiastically. Every day I book the hot spring gym playground and so on, I will tell her directly, no need to scan the code to make an appoin**ent. , But those few days were really enough to trouble her, thank you very much. I left a few things in a hurry when I checked out. Fortunately, the front desk called in time to inform us that we went back to pick them up again. Thank you very much.

The only thing we suggest is that the balcony of the twin room is small and the wall is too high. You can't see anything on the chair. It would be better if it should be made of glass railings. All in all, this holiday experience is very good and will come again in the future.

The scenery was refreshing and the service was warm and appropriate. I accompanied my 80-year-old mother on her birthday. The service housekeeper Hongmei called one day in advance to communicate and arrange. After arriving at the hotel, other staff also had a sense of ownership of the hotel. They were enthusiastic and not overstepping their boundaries. As a patient with deep social phobia, I had convenient services and did not have to bite the bullet to socialize during my vacation. There were Zhou Fang and Avon who waited silently, and Jinlai who used environmentally friendly items to decorate the room in advance, which was warm and atmospheric. There is an essential oil SPA at the health center every day in the private bath room on the first floor balcony. Sister Li Tao's Swiss oil massage technique and atmosphere are so comfortable. I also booked a facial treatment for the next day at my own expense. YOYO combined Thai stretching and facial treatment in one go. I took a nap directly in the aroma of the nice floral essential oil and music.
My mother and I don't really like hot springs, but the private hot spring on the balcony is available anytime, anywhere. The room attendant disinfected and rinsed it several times for me the first time, washing away the dust that had been blown in by the strong wind the night before. It was very convenient to go back to the bathroom and change clothes after the bath. I went to visit the Banshan Hot Spring on the last day. I didn't expect the scenery to be so beautiful. After the glass sightseeing elevator, there were open-air wooden paths and gentle stairs. Thick and long cotton vests and plenty of bath towels were neatly hung on the roadside. There were 15 roofs, one side was open-air and breathable, and half of the floor-to-ceiling glass was embedded in it, facing the green mountains. The green was overwhelming, and the sun shone directly on the two single sofas in the innermost part. Because it was a weekday morning after the National Day, there was no one else at first. I sat there listening to the gurgling sound of the spring water and basking in the sun. It was not a holiday or a weekend, and I came here on a weekday. This is a place where the air and mountain scenery are good and I am alone. Ha~ This is not a sulfur hot spring, and there is no pungent smell. When climbing the mountain, I saw several pipes led down from the cliff. It felt like the hot Miyun Mountain Spring water. The hot springs were soaked in Chinese herbal medicine bags with different therapeutic effects. I went to see all the hot springs on the sunny side. The water was green and yellow, and the medicine bags were still effective.
We spent the whole morning slowly climbing a 220-meter-high hill with an artificial fountain behind the house. After the wooden plank road, there are mountain stone slabs, red brick roads, and Shashuo trails. Cosmos and wild chrysanthemums are blooming on both sides. It is really walking on the "flower road". There is a small signpost along the way, and there is a small place to rest. The wild flowers and green leaves are full of vitality, and the wooden fences and stone benches maintained by humans are always considerate. After walking, I can't help but want to recite poems, "The flower path has never been swept for guests, and the door is now open for you." My mother, who studied science and engineering, sighed sincerely several times. The management here is particularly meticulous. I think the decision makers and designers have a very good aesthetic: the appearance of the building, the garden and the sign have the flavor of the Han Dynasty. The night lights of the balcony private soup are all warm and low-key yellow lights, not red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple glare. Through the gaps of the parasols, you can see that the stars in the dense clouds are particularly numerous and bright.
Finally, the dishes in the Chinese restaurant that must be mentioned are really amazing and outstanding! The portion is very large. My mother and I are from the south and can't eat too much. Sometimes we have to order one dish. The Geleshan spicy chicken is crispy and tasty. The prawn spring rolls, husband and wife lung slices, and white fungus and snow pear are better than the Sichuan restaurants in the city. If there are more people, we will try other dishes. I didn't have time to eat alone in the Western restaurant. The breakfast buffet in the Western restaurant is very rich, with both Western and Chinese varieties. The fruits are especially good. The grapefruit and honeydew melon are large and juicy. The old people eat freshly cooked wontons and dandan noodles.
I wrote a long comment specifically to thank the hotel for its service and appreciate the aesthetics of Chinese Han style. I will remember to come again in the future. Haha, I will also give "tap water" to friends and colleagues. By the way, the mineral water I drink is bottled locally in Tibet more than 5,000 meters~

msg:Amy butler was very caring. After booking, he contacted us and added WeChat to share the hotel information. After arriving at the store, he introduced the location of the hot spring restaurant in the children's paradise to us in detail. He also helped bring the children downstairs to eat ice cream. I also thoughtfully added a bed-end stool to our room to prevent the child from falling out of bed while sleeping, and took the initiative to help us delay the check-out time until two o'clock in the afternoon the next day. The service is super attentive and superb. And sister Wang Mei in the children's playground gave us mineral water intimately. The child was sweating and reminded him to use the cold outside to add clothes to the child and help the child take a paper towel to wipe the sweat. Every waiter I met was very polite and took the initiative to greet me. This time I felt very good about staying in the store. The children had a good time. The children's playground and swimming pool are favorites of the children. I will stay again next time I have a chance.

msg:For hotels with a high level of service awareness, there is also a dedicated butler who will contact you in advance and help you throughout the process. Our housekeeper is the restaurant manager Xiaofang. The service is warm and thoughtful. He helped to coordinate all kinds of fronts and backs. He was very considerate. The children also gave cakes for their birthdays. We were at the door of the room for half an hour at dinner time. We were very sorry. Because of her help, our journey is more complete. Chunmei and Xiao Yang in the children's playground are also very warm and caring. They prepared small gifts for the children and recommended to take the elderly and children.
Transportation: It is very convenient to drive to the city, about an hour and a half, and then drive for about 20 minutes after getting off the highway. The hotel is halfway up the mountain, and there is a National Grid charging station across the road to the north, and there are about 20 charging piles. You can call a shuttle bus to pick up the mountain at the entrance of the hotel.
Room: We booked a 1.3-meter twin room. The housekeeper arranged the bed in advance. The two children did not worry about falling. The room facilities are very new. The whole house has smart lighting and smart toilets, even in five-star hotels in the city. Rarely. A full set of L‚ÄôOccitane toiletries, 5100 mineral water, is still very willing to invest in customers.
Food: The hotel has two restaurants, a Chinese restaurant and a western restaurant. There are many restaurants where you can eat reservoir fish within ten minutes of driving. The taste is also good. We ate pizza and salad for dinner at the hotel. Compared to the restaurants in the city, we have to wait Improve, the dessert quality is very good. The number of breakfasts is not much but the variety is relatively complete, but the restaurant is not very large, and there are fewer tourists when we go out of the way.
Hot spring: The public hot spring pool has 12 small pools and one large pool. Each small hot spring pool is independent, with tables, chairs and toilets. Due to the inconvenience of bringing a baby, we did not switch to the hot spring pool and did not go to the large pool when there were not many people. Basically, the family can enjoy a small soup pool alone. On the first evening, there happened to be no one at the highest point. We watched a perfect sunset.
Entertainment: I didn‚Äôt go to experience the fitness center but it‚Äôs pretty good to see other people‚Äôs comments. It‚Äôs worth mentioning that the children‚Äôs playground is super large, with three levels of climbing slides, trampolines, and another space with two levels of high climbing frames and large ocean balls. , Because there are very few people on the wrong peak, the kids play high
It is said that there will be discounts on Double Eleven, hot spring hotels worth visiting, although the price is higher, but it includes hot springs with excellent views of the scenery, large children's playground, good service, unique location, and very cost-effective!

msg:During the Mid-Autumn Festival holiday, the old man and old lady from the family came to the Gulf Mid-Levels Hot Spring Hotel. Eva Li Xin from the room depar**ent was our housekeeper. He provided warm, thoughtful and moderate service throughout the whole journey. Before traveling around domestic and foreign hotels, homestays, apar**ents, etc. I have lived a lot, and I feel that the general four or five stars are just like that. The regular service does not feel anything special, but Mid-Levels Bay does a good job.1. Early check-in: With the elderly, they want to be able to stay in the hotel at any time. The elderly can take a rest, adapt to the environment, and then start other activities. Originally, the Mid-Autumn Festival, plus two rooms with private soup and twin beds were reserved. Did not expect to check in early, after Eva's coordination, when we arrived at the hotel at 11:30, both rooms were ready, and I felt very good;2. The hotel‚Äôs environmental decoration and design details are very exquisite. The elevator button position is different from other hotels. The golden leaf on the top of the hotel lobby plus the golden branches and fine porcelain decorative lights are more magnificent. The linen in the room is very textured. All facilities: lighting, temperature, and TV can all be controlled by a tablet computer, which is more convenient for the times brought by the Internet of Things;3. Mini bar: all free, and I feel that the hotel is more a**ospheric. Unlike most hotels, when you leave the store, check the room and check the consumption. Sometimes I really prefer not to use it, and I don‚Äôt want to accept the "Do you have room consumption?" Inquiries; the free glacial mineral water in the room is also very good;4. Private bathing pool: This is probably the fastest water injection in many hot spring hotels I've been to. It fills a whole pool in about 20 or 30 minutes. It is not like an old hot spring hotel, which restricts water consumption during the stay. The details make people feel comfortable; the private soup is also equipped with a huge liftable parasol to avoid leaves and rain, but also to prevent embarrassment when looking down on the balcony upstairs. The attached medicated bath bag is very popular for the elderly;5. Mid-level hot spring bathing pool: I had lunch and went to Mid-level hot spring bathing pool at 2 o'clock. The scenery was really good. There are 13 semi-open bathing pools. Except for the first hot spring bathing pool, the rest are all medicines. Bath, like the Twelve Water Method of the Old Summer Palace, each room has a different zodiac stone water outlet. Of course, the bathing pool is also very popular. It is basically a bathing pool for a family. We went to the Ganoderma lucidum bathing pool with rooster stone carvings. The water temperature 36-40 degrees, you don‚Äôt need to adapt, you can soak directly in, watching the scenery of the mid-levels, and there is drizzle in the air. Generally, it is really pleasant to enjoy the comfortable medicated bathing springs; every pool side There is a free water bar not far away that provides ginger tea and sour plum soup. Old people feel thirsty after soaking for a while. After a cup of ice-cold sour plum soup, they will feel cool and comfortable;6. Physiotherapy center: Physiotherapy is included with the reservation. Eva kindly helped us book the Himalayan salt bath and the Bianstone room one day in advance. We started the experience on time at 3 o'clock. The physiotherapy center was guided by service staff throughout the whole process and assigned to The experience is very comfortable in a room with few people. The salt steam room is not too hot. The old lady has high blood pressure and stayed for 20 minutes. She feels bored. The stone bed is a bit hot, but it feels like I have been sitting for a long time. I feel discomfort in the cervical spine. I lie on it and bake it hot for a while, but I also feel that the soreness is greatly relieved;7. Space Stadium: The appearance is a unique capsule design. After the physical therapy, play table tennis and badminton for a while and make full use of the time before dinner. Of course, this is also arranged by Angel Eva in advance;8. Park: Because the weather has been raining during the stay, the hiking trail failed to be realized after dinner originally planned, but the park is also big enough, and the elderly feel good for a walk and digestion;9. Evening: Generally, the pillows in hotels are hard or soft. Old people always feel uncomfortable. Usually, they use bath towels to stack a small pillow to save the uncomfortable. However, Mid-Levels Hotel provides four different sizes, soft and hard pillows, and there is always one that suits you. , There is a spare quilt in the closet, you can choose, it is a detail, otherwise it is troublesome to always call room service;10. Breakfast: objective evaluation, there are a lot of people, I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the reason for the holiday season, there are a lot of people eating in the morning, the table is densely arranged, and it‚Äôs inconvenient to sit up; there are still many types in the morning, what can be mentioned is that there are salmon in Japanese food , Miso soup; Chinese food has tofu nao, fried dough sticks, pancakes, Dandan noodles (I am looking forward to it, but I did not eat fried liver) Western food has croissants, etc. Others are regular milk, juice, coffee, wonton, porridge, Tea, eggs, fried rice, noodles, etc. One of the uncomfortable places is the seat and the other is the dinner bowl. Whether it is a porridge bowl, a soup bowl, or a bowl of tofu nao, they are all very small and not very convenient to use. It's about the amount of one tablespoon;11. Other:1) The details of the hotel are very well done, especially the uninterrupted disinfectant and masks in the lobby during the epidemic, and guests are reminded to wear masks from time to time;2) In the evening, Eva had already left work and arranged milk and yogurt for the elderly, which was very considerate;3) Before the return trip, Eva also arranged for Zhou Fang and Feifei to bid farewell to the room, pay a return visit, and presented two sets of L‚ÄôOccitane bathing suits, TWG tea bags and mineral water to drink on the road. Although it is not a big thing, it is It feels very thoughtful;The above is the current account during my stay with my family and it is also a real experience. The average hotel, no matter how high-end, including Banyan Tree, Angsana, Aman or Club Med, etc., must be very good, but staying I have stayed after I have passed it. I basically don‚Äôt want to go again, but I hope to experience a new hotel next time. However, the Bay Banshan Hot Spring Hotel is really the only hotel I am looking forward to visiting again, so far. The hardware has nothing to say, the service is very in place, and when it is in place, it is moderate. It will not make people feel alienated because of indifference, and it will not make people uncomfortable because of being cold. All in all, it is very good. Finally, I would like to thank Eva, Zhou Fang and Feifei of the Housing Management Depar**ent again, and look forward to meeting again.

I personally think that this place may be more suitable for elderly people to come to recuperate!

üîîService: Very good, there will be a housekeeper before and after arrangements, explaining the purpose of the holiday, will help with the room layout, and will also give some additional hidden benefits

üçÉEnvironment: Banshan Hot Spring/5km Panshan Road are very good. I also experienced the complimentary spa to completely relax. The only downside is that mosquitoes are crazy at the end of summer, so you must remember to take protective measures

üöó Transportation: If you go by car, it is better to park in the middle of a villa area in Miyun. The inside of the hotel is very large. You can follow the instructions first and then there will be a shuttle bus to the lobby

This time I am still very grateful to the housekeeper (should be the restaurant manager) Wang Na. The spa also recommends Xiao Li and Xiao Mei, a very satisfying anniversary.

msg:Great hotel experience!
Let's talk about the service first: from the warm reminder sent by the hotel the day before arrival, Sally Gao Yanling, the office of the office, asked when she would arrive on the day of check-in, and whether she needs to prepare anything in advance. Arriving at the hotel, Sally waited at the front desk to help check in and deliver to the room. During the stay, he would always ask if he needed this, and if it was missing, he also gave the kids cakes. When we left, they also gave the kids ice cream to eat. Received moon cakes. All in all, it is very caring ~ there are only things we can't think of, nothing she can't think of, very careful.
The service staff of the children‚Äôs playground are also very good. The baby will come forward to comfort the baby when he cries. The attitude towards the baby is also very loving~
The service staff in the restaurant are also very attentive. Seeing that we brought the baby to dinner, they offered baby chairs, baby tableware, and baby bibs. The service staff responded quickly when needed!
What surprised us the most was that the hotel staff helped to wipe the car clean when we left. My husband said: Every service staff in this hotel is in good condition. I said: This is called supreme service.
Let's talk about the environment: it's great and clean. The toiletries in the room are all L'Occitane, and the tea bags are all TWG. The room environment is very good, and there is some sense of science and technology.
The hot spring is on the mountainside and can be reached by elevator, and then climb the steps to reach the hot spring where you want to soak. The scenery is beautiful, beautiful on the way up the mountain, and the hot springs are also beautiful ~ you can change your clothes in your room and go directly to the hot springs.
Finally, let‚Äôs talk about the food: the hotel has a Chinese restaurant and a western restaurant, both taste good, especially the breakfast is very hearty! We had lunch in a Chinese restaurant, the price was quite high~ but the hotel also understood that it tasted good!
I didn't climb the mountain this time, because it is really inconvenient to bring the baby, so I plan to come again next time!

1. Before booking, follow the hotel‚Äôs official WeChat, add fan groups to communicate with water friends, grab various coupons, and avoid peak passenger flow if possible. There are fewer people everywhere, and you can have more fun. Special note: room types for birthdays and anniversaries can be upgraded for free
2. Thanks for the professional service of the butler Sally. I responded to all the major issues and small feelings encountered in the hotel as soon as possible, and helped to make reservations for various activities. In addition, I thoughtfully applied for late check-out, and arranged Gao Bo and Shi Fengming. The two masters helped us wash the car.
3. Happy Li from the Creative Workshop, a very caring and patient young lady, accompanies the baby to make mosaic coasters and pottery pots, and play hoops in the gym.
4. The activities in the Star Kitchen are different every day. I make tuna sandwiches on Wednesdays and cookies on Thursdays. The baby asked what I did today, and I said I went home today.
5. Jiaojiao and Meimei from the children's club guide the children to overcome their fears and play a tall slide. The family of three also built a big castle

First of all, the exclusive butler Xiaofang will contact you the night before to help you book the next itinerary. No matter when and where there is any need, a WeChat or a phone call, she will help you solve it immediately. It's inevitable to be a little rushed when dragging the family out to play. Having such a housekeeper guarantees the logistics, which is really worry-free.
The children‚Äôs playground is very large and clean. Children don‚Äôt want to come out as soon as they enter. The staff can take care of them. Wang Haijiao and Wang Mei are very kind to the children. Under the premise of ensuring safety, they can chat and interact with the children and play games.
Here you can also do handicraft lessons and participate in activity competitions. Teacher He and Teacher Li in it are very patient and guide the children to complete the works by themselves.
The young lady in the Chinese restaurant will not only give the children custard packets, but also fold small balloons of various animals. The restaurant director Xiaofang is warm and thoughtful. The lion head is tender and fresh, the boiled beef is numb and tender, the amount of vegetables is large, and it can be eaten every time.
Mr. Dong, the doorman, helped us carry and put our luggage, and did his best.
Hot springs are the focus. There are 12 small pools of various kinds, and a large pool can also provide bubble massage. Both the elderly and the children are having fun.
This hotel experience was great!

Sally said that it would be nice to tell her in advance where he wants to go, and then I have been looking for sally to make an appoin**ent for the past two days. Sally did it in time to change the time. The child also gave cakes and longevity noodles on his birthday. It also reminded me that Sally's considerate service is definitely a plus for the hotel during breakfast and dinner the next day! We checked in on Thursday and school has started, so there are very few people. The pool can be one family and one pool. There are only two or three children in the children‚Äôs club. The facilities are a bit old but the sanitation is good, but it is a little damp, and the children are uncomfortable for a long time. The Chinese restaurant set menu tastes quite satisfactory, the service is very good, the room facilities are complete, and the children‚Äôs bathrobes and slippers are prepared in advance, but the children‚Äôs tableware is very strange and only has a metal spoon... The room service staff is very enthusiastic, and they will say hello when they see it. The bathroom of the guest room is really good Everyone complained that the shower water was hot and cold, the shower head was sinking, and it felt like a pit could be thrown out if it accidentally dropped. Overall the hotel is good, suitable for the whole family to play, the child said that next time I come to see Aunt Sally!

The hotel strives to send all kinds of thoughtful gifts (welcome swan setting in the room, moon cake souvenirs, car wash, etc.), so we must be pleasantly surprised and don't want to leave.

The "Seven Stars Tour" in the back mountain is very beautiful. The mountain roads are well-designed, with mountain and stone paths, red brick roads, wooden planks, stone paths interlaced, sidewalks, flowers and trees, small insects chirping, and full of spirituality.

It was really good, and I was very sweaty and healed the damp young lady. The hotel is very friendly to children, and they will greet them when they meet. It is worth bringing your family here. I will book again next time!

There is a children‚Äôs playground, a swimming pool with a suitable water temperature, and an outdoor half-mountain hot spring, 12 pools, soaking side by side Enjoy the scenery, very distinctive. It is very suitable for parent-child travel. The focus is on service, and I feel at home. From the shuttle bus, the bellman, the receptionist, to the room service staff, they are all very professional and hospitable. Especially Huang Li, the lobby manager who served us this time, is very professional and enthusiastic about his attention anytime and anywhere and various heart-warming services. There is also Wang Xiaoying, the director of the western restaurant, who actively helped us solve the difficulties and handled it perfectly. Only high-end hotels with high-quality services can get better and better. A recommended hotel!

msg:Staying for the first time, the five-star is well deserved. First of all, one-on-one. Someone is called a housekeeper. I would like to call him "my own person"-Li Yingying. Upon learning of the child‚Äôs birthday, she deliberately confessed to sending welcome cakes, decorating the room, and pre-booking various children‚Äôs activities for the children. She also gave the child ice cream before leaving. In short, she thought of everything you could think of. By the way, the celebrity kitchen is a chargeable item, but eating pizza made by the children is not something that can be exchanged for money, and the sense of ceremony is full! Let‚Äôs talk about the gymnasium. If you can get up early, it's about 9-10 o'clock. If you can't get up early, it can be about 10-11 o'clock. It's just right after breakfast. At nine o'clock for breakfast, there are the most people, so you must avoid it. Don't get up early to climb the mountain if you are afraid of snakes, advice. Let‚Äôs talk about bathing. There must be few people during lunch and dinner. Don‚Äôt forget to bring a bag and goggles for swimming. Bring plenty of water. You can go swimming directly after bathing. Different soups have different colors, like green tea and aloe vera. There are many people in the swimming pool and few seats on the shore. It is still difficult to rest. For children‚Äôs playgrounds, perhaps the most fun is the slide bar. You can go at any time. There is no need to treat it as a key project, just plug it in. The southern area is next to the playground, and the northern area has restaurants and hot springs. I think the northern and southern areas can be used in summer, but it is better to be closer to the hot springs in winter. We live in the southern area, which is connected to the lobby, which is also convenient. Thanks again for the service of the Gulf, and Li Fang, who is in charge of the gymnasium, not caring. By the way, stay at least two nights. The western restaurant is very good, there is no need to go out to eat some reservoir fish.

The mountain view hot spring makes people linger and staying in one day is definitely not enough! It is particularly worth mentioning that Tina Xiaoying, the director of catering, is 100% enthusiastic about the children. She arranges seats in advance, fearing that the children will be hungry, and prepares the children's desserts in advance every time, which is very meticulous. Room supervisor Han Yu is warm and attentive and responsive, giving children small gifts super cute. There are also roses quietly sent by the service ambassador Mai Mai on the eve of Chinese Valentine's Day, making people feel little happiness instantly! In short, the attentive service that can be seen everywhere often brings surprises to people! A recommended hotel, see you in winter!

msg:Can't go out of Beijing because of the epidemic. Is the summer vacation when the baby said that he can't travel is called summer vacation? So I came for a walk-and-go trip, coordinated to the Miyun Bay Banshan Hot Spring Hotel.
The first thing to praise is service. The day before departure, Miss Li Xinxin and Eva from the hotel contacted by phone. Because there were so many people during the summer vacation, she asked us our estimated time of arrival, so as not to be unable to check in in time. On the day of check-in, we started to keep in touch with us from around one o'clock, and cared about where we were all the way. When we arrived, we coordinated our room check-in and helped us make an appoin**ent to go to the pool. The next morning, we also reminded us of breakfast time. Although we did not meet, we communicated throughout the whole process and were very careful. Secondly, two hours before check-out, the two sisters Zhou Fang and Peng Yuqin from the housekeeping depar**ent thoughtfully sent a few more bottles of water to drink on the road, and also sent a sample of L‚ÄôOccitane's bath, which was not seen in other hotels. It may be these details that impress customers at that time!
Then talk about the hotel's hardware. The location of the hotel is actually very close to the city of Miyun, and it is almost an hour away from Beijing city without traffic jams. It is called Banshan Hot Spring Hotel. It is really located in the middle of the mountain. The hotel is built on the mountain. The huts in Tangquan are all on the mountain. The hotel also has a plank road leading to the mountain. For children, having a swimming pool is enough! There is a swimming pool and a hot spring pool in Banshan Hot Spring. The swimming pool is a standard swimming pool, two small hot spring pools for children to play; Tangquan Pavilion has a dozen pools of different flavors, each pool is in a cabin, relatively private, when there are not many people, the family is in the same cabin It's still very good.
The food and accommodation is quite satisfactory. The hotel has a western restaurant and a Chinese restaurant. The western restaurant only has breakfast and buffet, and lunch and dinner are all a la carte. The Chinese restaurant is rather amazing, tastes good, and the price is relatively reasonable. Before reading the reviews, we brought some food for ourselves. Every day we have a breakfast buffet, a light meal in the middle, and a decent meal in the restaurant in the evening.

Service: 5 stars. Before check-in, because the child has online classes at 12 o'clock, ask the hotel in advance if possible, try to help check in early. Eva immediately helped with the coordination after receiving the call, and told me before 12 o'clock that I could move in at 12 o'clock to ensure that the children would not be delayed in class. They will also take the initiative to ask if they need help; before leaving, the housekeeper ambassador Feifei helped coordinate the half-hour late check-out so that the child can return to the room to tidy up after swimming. At the same time, waiters Yu Guizhen and Daisy sent mineral water to drink on the way back.
Eating: There are two restaurants-Chinese restaurant and Western restaurant. Western restaurants have more styles and richer dishes; Chinese restaurant breakfast is a little simple, but porridge, various Chinese breakfast such as steamed dumplings, Cantonese desserts, porridge, etc. are also very rich. The Miyun Fish Street is 3 kilometers away, which is very convenient.
Hygiene: clean
Entertainment activities: swimming pools, children's playgrounds, gymnasiums, hot springs, and hotel features-hiking trails (approximately 5 kilometers, 1 hour), are generally very rich. All ages. Hot springs and gymnasiums need to be reserved in advance.

What impressed me most was Xiaofang, the service director of the Chinese restaurant, who was warm and thoughtful. Because it was the first time to go to unfamiliar with the terrain, we took us to the children's playground. The recommended set meal at noon and the big fish head in the evening will leave you with a fragrant aftertaste. In the evening, WeChat introduced the breakfast situation, allowing us to avoid the peak dining period and enjoy a pleasant breakfast.
The swimming pool on the second floor is the children's favorite, not enough to play. The back mountain has a beautiful scenery. Although it is very hot, I still walked around with my child and felt comfortable after sweating.
I am ready to go again in the fall, because there are a lot of words on outdoor hot springs in summer

Finally, the lobby manager waived this part of the fee and refunded I can understand the overcharge for 10,000 steps, but I need to explain it well in advance;
2. The temperature in the aisle on the guest room floor is a bit low, and it feels cold;

The swimming pool is good, and there is a constant temperature pool, but it is a bit hot inside. The children's activity center is a highlight , The child can play for several hours, our child is a little small, can only play ocean ball. The baby also gave a small birthday cake for his birthday.

Temporary search for changes came to the bay mid-levels,
Unexpectedly, there were a lot of surprises on this journey~
First of all, because it was for the baby‚Äôs birthday, I asked for the room to be slightly decorated.
I didn‚Äôt expect to receive many surprises this way,
Room manager Feifei and Foreman Avenue are very enthusiastic.
Not to mention the birthday cake made of towels, I also gave the baby birthday cake,
Xiaofang Xiaofang from the Chinese restaurant and Xiaoying from the western restaurant are both very delicate.
The baby ate 3 cakes and 2 longevity noodles on this day.
She was so happy that she said straight, why am I so popular [shy]
The whole meal service is also in place. After dinner, I asked if I want to warm the milk, which can be delivered to the room~ it's so sweet~

Environmentally:
There is a large children's visitor center for 3-8 years old. The dolls can play in it for more than 2 hours, and it can also take care of it, which is great~
If you mainly want to go to the hot springs in the middle of the mountain, you can choose to live in the north wing, close to the swimming pool hot springs, so you don't have to go to the lobby.
At this time, the hot spring is still suitable for night soaking. It is too hot during the day, plus the hot spring, it feels really refreshing~
Bingquan is really super super super cold, the others are medicated baths, the bubbles are still delicious~
The bedding in the guest rooms is also good, all from L‚ÄôOccitane, the only thing is that there may be few double-bed rooms, most of them are double beds, and the others are fine.
The hotel also has a badminton hall and a basketball hall. You need to bring your own badminton. There is also a hill. I didn‚Äôt go there because of temporary rain. You can take a look at the top of the hill next time~

msg:üìç Location: It is convenient to drive, from the city to the north by navigation, the Beijing Cheng Expressway-Daguang Expressway-Binhe Road can be reached. The hotel has ample parking space, there is a parking lot on the ground and underground, and the underground parking lot is on the left side of the square outside the lobby.
üè© Layout: The hotel is built in the north and south, and it is located in the east and west. The central lobby is divided into two floors, and the activity venue is from north to south. The following are: Banshan Hot Spring - Sports Hall - Restaurant - Natatorium - Lobby - Children's Paradise. Personally, whether it is dining or entertainment, it is relative to the North Building. It's easier.
üõè Room: Choose a deluxe twin room, room is about 40„é°, there is a balcony to enjoy the mountain view, the mattress is soft and hard, and provides three different sizes of soft and hard pillows, the head of the bed has smart PAD to adjust the lighting, air conditioning and other room facilities. The mini-bar in the room is free with imported coffee, beer, juice, mineral water. The wash area is dry and wet separated, the bath shower is ready, the TOTO smart toilet, the toiletries of Oshudan, for the convenience of the guest family, three soak hot springs, the room provides two big and one small three bathrobes and three pairs of CROCS slippers, the details are full.
üë©üèª‚ÄçüíºService: Service awareness and attitude must be praised üëçNot long after ordering in Trip.com, the exclusive butler calls to confirm the order and provide consultation. The customer service butler, Miss Eva Li Xinying, only heard that she did not see her person. Not only did she introduce the hotel's facilities and activities in detail. We have met our requests for such things as the reservation of the sports ground and the provision of handbags, and we are delighted to have a pleasant and unobstructed journey under Miss Li's arrangement. And Wang Haiping of the gym, not only volunteered to bring us towels and mineral water, but also intimately sent to our children's small Lego toys, give them two thoughtful service points ‚ùóÔ∏è In addition, whether it is the lobby front desk or the cleaning staff encountered in the corridor, will smile and give you a warm greeting. The hotel reflects the solid and strong training mechanism and good team a**osphere.
üç≤ Catering: Checked online, the price of both Chinese and Western restaurants in the hotel is more expensive, so lunch and dinner are out to solve, and the economy is vigorously pursued while enjoying the great scenery of Miyun. Free breakfast is more than expected, Chinese and Western, a wide variety of dishes, fresh ingredients, delicious. The restaurant is also very reasonable layout, convenient to take meals, a small suggestion: automatic coffee machine is not set with milk, want to drink latte, but also have a good Italian concentrated to add milk, small inconvenience.
‚ô®Ô∏è Hot Spring: Since the hot spring is the main selling point, you have to experience the various soup pools. The hot spring area is located in the middle of the north side of the hotel. There are about a dozen different health-care pools, each spaced more than ten meters, set up in a wrong way, so that you can easily change different experiences. Each soup pool is a semi-closed wooden house style, personal feeling is much cleaner than the pure open-air soup pool, there are sofas and television, there is a separate bathroom, while enjoying the night mountain view while enjoying the soup, while still feeling the coolness brought by the wind from the semi-closed glass windows, I'm so happy!
‚õπüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Activity Project: 1 Ô∏è‚É£ There are basketball, badminton and table tennis in the gym. The standard of the stadium is regular and the layout is reasonable. The gym provides rackets and balls, and there is free mineral water. It is thoughtful and caring. Tip: The venue needs to be booked in advance after check-in!
2Ô∏è‚É£ Children's Paradise is in the South Building. It seems to be a small area from the entrance. After entering, there are other holes. The slide, the ocean ball pool, the small expansion project have everything. A water soft package, the safety factor is trustworthy. Personally, children over the age of six can feel free to leave, and parents of young children are equipped with car seats.
3Ô∏è‚É£The second floor of the North Building is an indoor pool, with a six-distance pool of 25 meters deep 1.5 meters and two children's warm water pools, fully catering to the different needs of the guests. The water depth of the pool is about 0.6 meters, there is a spray massage, the children are not happy,
4Ô∏è‚É£ Through the hotel lobby to the east side of the hotel, you can experience the mountain climbing and distant view. There are two lines up the mountain. With each human strength, each climb has a rest point named after the solar system planet. You can stop and take pictures of the mountain view. The mountain is covered with vegetation and oxygen, and the top of the mountain provides a panoramic view of the hotel. Near the top of the mountain there are light signs with the hotel's English name, and at night you can see the feeling of being in Hollywood Beverly Hills.
üôÜüèª General Review: The hotel is well-deserved as the first place for North China's parent-child summer vacation. The hardware facilities are well equipped and the service is impeccable. Parent-child, couples, and filial piety are suitable for the elderly! Although the price is small but expensive compared to the city of 2000 five-star hotel, at the same time you can experience soup, mountaineering, swimming, eve, sports and other colorful additional items, is definitely worth the money! Hopefully the hotel will stay at its current level and will definitely return in the future!!!

msg:The breakfast is very rich, Chinese and Western breakfasts are available, as well as simple Japanese ingredients to meet the needs of different groups of people. Western restaurants and Chinese restaurants are expensive, with average taste and not amazing. The hot springs of the 12 Chinese zodiac are not fully open. It is a pity that I did not go to the hot springs of my Chinese zodiac. There are not many people who go to the hot springs of the Chinese zodiac. The water in the swimming pool is colder, but there are also two heated pools, which the children enjoy. The slides, building blocks and ocean balls in the children's playground are my son's favorites, and he is reluctant to think about it. The toilet in the bathroom is a bit offensive and I hope to improve it. The baths prepared for the guests are all from L‚ÄôOccitane, and children‚Äôs bath shampoos and body lotions, as well as toothbrushes, are also prepared for the children. In short, this parent-child trip is very satisfied, the service is in place, the hotel environment is very good, the decoration is tall, and I will take my parents again in autumn and winter to climb the mountain behind. I hope that the catering can be improved. I feel that the price/performance ratio is a bit low.

msg:Friends recommended staying at the Bay Banshan Hot Spring Hotel.
First of all, I was very satisfied with the service. Manager Cao helped upgrade the room; the waiter delivered fruits to the room after check-in; the court service staff Wang Haijiao helped the children with towels and water. The other two court staff were also very enthusiastic.
In terms of hardware, the house feels spacious and bright as a whole. Drinks and beer in the small refrigerator are free, and the bathtub is a favorite of children. The hot spring pool halfway up the mountain is a highlight, with good views and strong privacy.
For breakfast, there are many varieties, Chinese and Western dishes are available, the bread tastes good, and the freshly ground coffee is very authentic.
It is worth mentioning that when he left the store, Manager Cao also gave the child ice cream. A very satisfactory accommodation experience.

Keeping good memories.
The hotel has good hardware and software, supporting parent-child facilities and activities are more rich, the oversized children's playground, the wide sports venues, advanced fitness equipment, a variety of hot spring pool, colorful hiking trails, all leave our shadow.
A little tip, one is that the indoor spray will occasionally cool and heat, the second is that the restaurant lunch and dinner food price can be appropriate and affordable, the third is that the sports venues experience a little short for an hour, and Trip.com this is written or unlimited experience, and the actual or there is a difference.
The service of the hotel can't be described simply in terms of excellence. Every service staff will meet and say hello, polite and meticulous, which makes many big brand hotels can't do it. Thank you for your name, manager Beck, who has been kind to us from beginning to end, has provided us with thoughtful service to our rooms, Daisy and May Xiao, and has provided cleaning services to our car, the Ministry of Security, Wang Qiang, Liu Wu Chou, also want to thank every warm-hearted service staff these days.

The staff of the gymnasium, Xiao Wang and Xiao Li, played with the baby patiently, listened to the baby‚Äôs suggestions, and actively cooperated. I was very touched by the hotel. The staff at the hotel will say hello when they meet. It is indeed the hotel we have planted since last year. Various details can reflect the quality of service. Both Chinese and Western food are delicious. The spicy chicken tastes very good. My friend‚Äôs baby tasted it for the first time. The spicy fragrant pot, the swimming pool and the soup pond are even more necessary to play. Today I am climbing the mountain. We stayed for two nights before we can experience the various projects in the hotel. Hao Hengdi

I have to say that the standard of service in the hotel is very high. When all the waiters see you, they will take the initiative to say hello, giving people a very intimate feeling. At the same time, Ctrip users can also enjoy free car wash services. This point is particularly commendable Hu Yu and Shi Fengming from the Ministry of Safety Affairs. The main feature of the hotel is hot springs, more than 10 different types of outdoor pools, which are great for physical and mental relaxation. The children‚Äôs club is also a favorite of children, and it‚Äôs not a problem to play here for a long time. Airbag fitness center, rich breakfast and L‚ÄôOccitane toiletries are all worthy of praise. There is also a hiking trail behind the hotel, friends who like mountaineering exercise can feel it, the difficulty is not too great. The only inconvenience is that if you live in the south wing, you may have to walk a long way to the swimming pool and hot springs. If it is winter, you must pay special attention. The two-day itinerary, I am very satisfied overall, if I have the opportunity, I will visit again.

msg:I haven't been out of Beijing for nearly two years, so every weekend excursion will be all kinds of entanglements, for fear of being distracted by those so-called fake star hotels + exaggerated reviews. After all, resort hotels in the suburbs of Beijing can't compare to those tourist cities. The hotel has its own characteristics. So I came to the Gulf Mid-Levels with a dubious attitude, but I didn't expect a surprise along the way! The architectural style of the hotel, the landscaping design is similar to the Ritz-Carlton, Yalong Bay, and the warm and thoughtful service makes people mistaken for the service-centric Southern Tourism Resort Hotel. Mr. Jiang at the front desk happily satisfied our request for a free room upgrade. Ms. Deng from the western restaurant presented drinks that night and also provided goodnight milk to the room service for our Erbao. Sunny Yang and Ms. Zhao from the children‚Äôs club provided us with thoughtful service. I also gave away two small toys to the children before leaving. During the three days and two nights of staying in the hotel, there were smiling and polite service staff everywhere. The colorful childcare activities were really awesome. The only one What I regret is, why didn‚Äôt I pull the ****s early? It can be said that this is the best parent-child resort hotel I have stayed in Beijing so far. It is a well-deserved five-star resort hotel. It‚Äôs really good. I strongly recommend staying more than two nights, otherwise it‚Äôs too bad. . I will definitely go there often in the future.

On weekdays, there were not too many people in the morning and at night, so we could almost exclusively occupy a hot spring pool. In the afternoon, I went to the gymnasium to play feathers for an hour, took the children crazy to play in the children's playground for two hours, and went to the gym to steam again in the evening. It was perfect. Breakfast is included in the room rate. We have ordered two room dining services in the room. My parents ate in the hotel room for the first time, and kept lamenting "there is this service". The kids have a lot of luggage. The handsome little brother brought the luggage cart to the room and took away the luggage first. The family was very satisfied with this trip and said he would come again~~~

If you have requirements for the scenery outside the balcony window, choose a garden-view room at last, otherwise the view of the ordinary deluxe room is very limited. The design of the hot and cold water knobs in the bathroom is not very convenient, it is too inconvenient to adjust the temperature, and there is no indication of the opening and closing directions.

In short, it is really a hotel worth visiting again.

msg:It can be said that the service is very attentive. Before departure, the housekeeper Li Lingfei contacted and provided intimate consultation services. When entering the room, the elder sister Wang Jinrong provided enthusiastic service. There was also a male supervisor who did not ask for a name to give us a home away from home experience; the children‚Äôs activity center Several service staff are very good, such as Sister Wang Chunmei and Wang Haijiao. The details of the above services are also particularly touching. The taste of the Chinese restaurant and the all-day breakfast are very good. After checking out, I was touched again. The car park manager put a shade on the front windshield of each car parked on the ground, which is a perfect parent-child holiday experience. Finally, I will share a few tips. I recommend the deluxe double bed room with garden view. The chaise couch can be turned into a bed when opened. It happens to be two children sleeping. It is especially suitable for two big and two small stays. The hot spring bathing pools should also be mentioned. They are built on the mountain, each bathing pool is equipped with a separate bathroom, and the sanitary cleaning is also very timely. There is a large-sized half-mountain hot spring soup house, near the entrance trestle bridge, which is an indoor glass house. The soup pond is relatively large, with showers and changing rooms. It is especially suitable for winter. It is better to soak in winter. The must order in the Chinese restaurant is the Reservoir Fish Head Cakes, the key point can be half! It's very affordable! The small river prawns are also large portions. They are finely made and taste good. They beat the surrounding farmer‚Äôs dishes, so you don‚Äôt need to go out to find a place to eat. More than 500 parent-child packages on Ctrip should be reserved in advance. It is not recommended. One fish head biscuits, one fried river prawn, and one or two vegetarian dishes. Two snacks and two snacks are very comfortable, and one person can take less than one. One hundred dollars. Note that dinner starts at 5:30, and there are many people going there as early as possible on weekends. The video is in the salt bath room, which is free to experience and requires advance reservation.

msg:I have always wanted to come to Beijing Bay Mid-Levels Hot Springs before, and finally decided to check in at the hotel. After booking, the management Li Xin Eva contacted me as soon as possible to answer all kinds of questions. The service was very attentive, and the baby was prepared with toiletries. After arriving, I was pleasantly surprised. I checked the reservation text messages strictly at the entrance of the hotel. When I arrived at the square, I ran into a staff member named Qu Yingpeng who was very enthusiastic. We first arranged our car in the underground garage, and then I saw the guy trotting behind. He came to the underground garage to help us unload our luggage. This made me feel his enthusiasm for work and his service attitude. Then he helped us unload the luggage while introducing the hotel, how to climb the mountain, how to go to the hot springs, and where is the children‚Äôs paradise. The details are very detailed, which makes me feel very much looking forward to this stay. Then Yingpeng Qu sent us to the lobby, and arranged for Lou Zhiyong and Feng Xiangguo from the Security Affairs Depar**ent to clean the vehicle for us! Upon entering the room, the staff Li Lingfei arranged the room warmly in advance and prepared a fruit plate. After a short break, I went to have afternoon tea. It tasted good and the service staff Zhao Jie was attentive. After that, she took the dumplings to the children's club she yearned for. The children's club Wang Mei introduced the various facilities of the children's club throughout the whole process, the service was very good, and she also gave the baby a small gift, which the baby loves! I went to a western restaurant for dinner on the way. The western food tastes great. I like the big burger the most. After that, the baby has been playing in the children's club until the club is off work! The next day I had a rich breakfast, and after playing in the children's club for a long time, the dumplings returned home in reluctance! The experience of staying in this time was perfect. This time it was a shop visit. Next time, you must stay for a few more days!

msg:First of all, we started to check in at about 1:00 p.m. We did our homework before, so after checking in, we browsed the multi-function hall of the hotel‚Äôs Banshan Hot Spring Children‚Äôs Paradise Restaurant Ball Stadium in general. The first feeling is that the mountains and rivers are the a**osphere. It's so much bigger than the average hotel, so it really feels very comfortable and not cramped
Secondly, after putting the luggage in the room, contact customer service and dial 0 to get everything done for you in the first time. It's really efficient. After dialing, the things you need are delivered. This speed is really good for children in the room. Anti-skid slippers for adults and children. There are all toiletries and all are L‚ÄôOccitane mineral water. Tibet ice spring minibar is the first free bathroom for dry and wet separation. There is a small balcony. We just finished the game and it is convenient to dry clothes. Because the bathroom plumbing has a small problem, the customer service will also contact the engineer soon to fix it. I made a special phone call to apologize and gave Xiaowa a copy of Movenpick ice cream
I felt it in every Tangchi, and Tangquan Station has intimate ginger sugar water and sour plum soup, which won the heart of the little baby. After playing the game, it‚Äôs so pleasant to have a soup in the mountains.
Generally speaking, the facilities are perfect and the service quality is good. Oh, by the way, the breakfast is also quite good. Both Chinese and Western style. There are also strawberries, raspberry yogurt, which is the favorite of the baby.
Finally, I would like to thank my sales Cassie for her patient explanation and caring help

The view of the distant mountain view in the Tangchi was super beautiful! The service is super good, from reception to appoin**ents for various events, they are very caring; Master Guo in the arena is super nice, the first time we took our children to play, and the next day we safely let the two children go by themselves. The breakfast is also very rich, that is, the peak is at 9 o'clock on the holiday, and I waited in line for about ten minutes

msg:If you want to take the elderly and children on a hot spring vacation during the Dragon Boat Festival, I came to see the good reviews of Banshan Hot Springs. The big bed in the hotel is very comfortable. It‚Äôs no problem for me to lie down for two days without doing anything. We went to bath in the pool on the mountain. The twelve bathing pools are allocated at different heights. There were not many people when we went. Yu was in a private bath. Enjoying the scenery while soaking, it feels pretty good. I also caught up with the very special thunderstorm. I ate in both Chinese and Western restaurants. The dishes are very authentic and tasteful, which can be comparable to the great restaurants in the city.
The breakfast buffet is very rich, with salmon lamb chops and various tropical fruits. The room rate for more than 4,000 a night is not so distressed, and I am very satisfied!
In addition to the hardware facilities, the service is also very satisfying to me. The service is enthusiastic and meticulous under the premise of large passenger flow during the holidays. A waiter came to deliver the fruit plate and opened the bed. Especially the big sister Wang from the children‚Äôs club, who is upright and friendly. She took her children twice during the stay and greeted us enthusiastically every time. Seeing the children sweating, they gave us water and reminded me of the hotel‚Äôs activities for the children, cinema, etc. . The child was very happy and reluctant to leave when he left. I hope the hotel will continue to maintain this good service, and I will choose here next time on holiday!

The children's playground and Banshan Hot Spring allow both adults and children to have what they need. And the hotel‚Äôs butler service is very considerate. The handsome Ma Aimin called and contacted him one day in advance to prompt travel information. After arriving at the store, he would help solve various problems enthusiastically. Thank you very much. The hotel and service are all satisfied, consider a second brush next time!

msg:The breakfast is great, with many varieties, both Chinese and Western dishes taste good, and the fruits are very fresh. The rooms are quite satisfactory. Relative to the price, the facilities are slightly outdated. The small balcony and drying rack are very user-friendly, eliminating the trouble of having nowhere to hang clothes. The children‚Äôs playground is very satisfied, the fresh air system, clean environment, spacious, safe and fun amu*****t facilities, children are very happy to play. I also hope that more staff will try their best to be on the slides and trampolines. Children are very forgetful when they play, and bumps will inevitably occur. Finally, there will be some small signs to remind you that only one child can be on the trampoline at a time, so as not to cause unnecessary Of friction. The overall park is great, except for some low-quality parents. The small hot spring house in the middle of the mountain is full of freshness, and the supporting bathroom is also very clean and odor-free. The swimming pools are also very good. The two heated swimming pools are spacious and not crowded, making them very suitable for smaller babies. I only ate it once for lunch and dinner, and the beef noodles and burgers tasted good and the amount was sufficient. In terms of service, the Dragon Boat Festival can be regarded as a small peak and there is one-to-one dedicated service. Susan at the front office is polite and warm, not too disturbing but taking care of everything, thank you very much. Overall a great experience. Will recommend friends to go together next time.

Han Yu and Li Lingfei are very enthusiastic to buy the supplies the children need in the room. The staff at the Children's Activity Center also take care of the children carefully. The children participated in the activities of making biscuits and creative towels organized by the hotel and had a great time. The catering manager Xiaoying and the lobby manager enthusiastically and carefully explained the layout of the hotel. In short, I experienced a small holiday with service-oriented experience here. Friendly reminder that breakfast must be rushed early, flowers that go to 9 o'clock, you need to line up to enter.

After arriving in the parking lot, there are Fu Wensheng, Gao Bo, Shi Fengming and Hu Yu from the Security Affairs Depar**ent to help clean the appearance of the car for free. In the evening, Manager Shi from the western restaurant gave the children cakes and hot milk. When checking out the next day, Li Lingfei from the housekeeping depar**ent also gave them portable toiletries. Only the exterior of the hotel seems to be under construction, and it is not refined enough, so the environment outside the building is so average, there is nothing to play around. The swimming hot springs and the children‚Äôs club are free to play. The children‚Äôs club also helps to take care of the children, probably because of summer. The water in the hot spring pool is warm and not very hot. There is an anti-haze inflatable gymnasium with badminton, table tennis and basketball. Guests in the hotel can play for one hour for free. The badminton racket is provided for free. It is Yonex‚Äôs. It‚Äôs very good, but the badminton needs to be purchased at 15 yuan each. Bring your own.

I really have a strong sense of service, which is great! The people who helped clean the vehicle include Fu Wensheng, Guo Yanzheng, Cao Hailong, and Qu Yingpeng. Thank you very much. The reception of nina at the front desk was also very enthusiastic. Because I was staying temporarily for another night, nina helped to confirm that one night was 1,000 yuan less than the booking on Ctrip. I just hate that I didn‚Äôt know before... After the room is booked, someone will keep paying We brought to the room. There is a card handwritten by the housekeeper in the room. There are not many handwritings in this era...the room is equipped with slippers for adults and children, which are cross-shaped, the bathroom is TOTO, the room is clean and tidy, the temperature is suitable, and Drinks in the small refrigerator are free on the first day. Our housekeeper is Wang Jinrong, and the aunt is full of enthusiasm. She prepares mosquito repellent, disposable bathtub bags, several bottles of water and so on. As they brought the children, the aunts and their leaders also prepared some small gifts, stickers, and toys for the children. The best experience is the warm service and the good supplies. For example, there are many choices of pillows. The disposable slippers are the thickest I have ever seen. Fruits are also very rich. Thanks to everyone who provided services.
