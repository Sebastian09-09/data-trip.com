There is a quite big child playclub, although slightly on the empty side, however it is free of additional charge. 
There are few cons to consider - the fitness is just 2 treadmills and a yoga mat :)

The breakfast had a good amount of variety and you can even get the typical Guilin Rice Noodles if you want.
The service was over the top (everyone was super friendly and attentive). If you have any questions the staff replies to your messages within minutes. We were asked if the breakfast is alright or if they should prepare a more western one for us. They probably also saw our bin filled with empty water bottles and provided us 1.5L bottles for free üòÇ
Will most certainly recommend this hotel to my friends and family and would also come myself again!

However it is not a big issue as you can simply take the didi, which is convenient and easy to use. We booked for a room that faces the mountain but changed it to one facing the river, which is so much better.

msg:I am an American, without any Chinese that travels in China and it's not always easy, to be honest. The taxi driver dropped me off in front of a hotel that said "SYYF" and I was dubious if I was in the right location. After I went inside, it was verified, and a lady from the front desk came out to help with the bags. I am looking for Li River Courtyard Hotel because that is what my receipt says. 
Check-in was fairly quick and painless. I enjoyed the artsy feel of the lobby and the spaciousness of the sitting area which had a great view of the river. I was shown to my room and it was clean, well-appointed and everything in place. Had a great view of the river and the monumental stone outside. 
Promptly went to the restaurant and it was closed, even though it stated it opens at 11:00 am.  This was a little frustrating and wasn't told to me that it changed times. A well-translated menu is very helpful and they didn't have one. 
Something that is very handy for a hotel to have, in Chinese and English is a listing of food places that are within walking distance. Or even just an area to head towards to know you can get food. 
I came back and got a Thai Massage and sadly forget the lady's name who gave it as she was top notch and the savings for being in the hotel made it so that I got a 2nd one the following night. 
When I finished up. the massage I went to the restaurant that I was told was open until 10 and I arrived at 9:15 and was told service was over. Apparently, you needed to order by 9. More importantly, I think that the restaurant people instead of just wanting to clean up and get out could have asked me what I wanted. It was going to be soup. Easy to fix, and clean up, but instead, I went to the front desk a little miffed. 
The two ladies at the front desk did a great job in helping me get the Gulin Soup from a local shop and while delivery took a long time it was worth the wait I appreciated the help because they didn't have to. 
The next morning it became clear that no one at the restaurant spoke English either, even though I was told at the front desk they did. Breakfast was fine, but I don't know why the coffee cups are so tiny. The selection was fine. It's a smaller hotel so I couldn't expect a huge spread but the quality was good and a range of options. The fruit was quality, but I wish the bacon and sausage were cooked more. 
It's a great view of the river and the hostess was attentive to me since she knew I wasn't a Chinese speaker. 
After a long time trying to find a tour I did opt to go to Seven Star Park, which was a good alternative because of the weather and time. The front desk spent a lot of time with me considering I did end up doing something that I didn't need a guide for. 
Had a 2nd wonderful massage, and greatly enjoyed it. Enjoyed the comforts and view of my room. I wish the bed was a little higher to make it easier to see out the window but loved the view. I went to the restaurant and still no English speakers to be found on staff. The same lady worked with me each visit and she was great. Helpful and patient I saw a shrimp dish in the elevator poster and ordered a shrimp dish from the menu and when it came it was not what one would expect at all. The menu pictures had nothing to show scale but the poster did and the shrimp was super tiny, and was expected to eat shell and tails as there would be no peeling them. This was a major disappointment and I sent it back. I knew I might get charged, but I didn't. Perhaps in the Chinese explanation it would have been noted they were super tiny, but there was no way for me to know. 
All in all, there were bumps in the road, but at each step, the staff stepped up. Helen, who seemed to be the manager helped me a couple of times and helped coordinate help when needed, but it was the staff and service that made it so I would return. 
The fact that several employees on different occasions went above and beyond helped me feel like it was a worthy stop.

The pool view is really nice. But the space around it is very small with only two sun beds without a comfortable cover. The sun umbrella was unfortunately damaged and needed to be replaced.

We also recommend to make a cooperation with a local scooter rental service. We had to find it separately and didn't know where to charge the battery. 

We wanted to try dinner at the roof top bar but we could not find some kind of western food on the menu.

We drove to this hotel along the beautiful scenery of the Li River. The housekeeper sent us the location in advance, and it was easy to find. the parking lot is very large, and it is closed to a lotus pond. The temperature in the lobby is super cozy. The bright lobby makes people feel comfortable and comfortable. The hot drinks from the tea shop provides you excellent warmth. The best part of the room is you can enjoy the scenery of the Li River, the interior is exquisitely decorated, polo toiletries, TOTO sanitary ware and thermostatic toilets.  The instant hot water system in the room is very easy to use, the network speed is fast, and the breakfast is nice and delicious.

Ha Bao also liked it very much and wanted to stay in the hotel all the time. After checking in, the hotel also provided small fish nets and fishing rods for fishing and catching fish, and a cameraman followed to take pictures (the photographer was very handsome and interesting). The main thing was that the photos felt very good. All the services are provided free of charge by the hotel. There is a swimming pool on the top floor, a restaurant on the 6th floor, and a yoga gym on the 4th floor. It has everything. There is really no need to check in at the scenic spots. Staying in the room and the hotel lobby is also a kind of enjoyment.

First of all, there are many breakfast choices and the taste is very good, especially the bowl of Guilin rice noodles, which is so authentic that it makes people aftertaste endlessly, and makes people feel full of happiness early in the morning. And breakfast is open until 10:30, which is simply a blessing for lazy people.
The hotel's river view room is even more amazing. Standing in front of the window, the beautiful scenery of the Li River is in full view, as if the entire river surface is unfolding for you. In addition to the room, the first, sixth and seventh floors of the hotel can all see the Li River unobstructed.
It is worth mentioning that the hotel's rooms are very delicately designed, and every corner can be used to take blockbusters. Whether it is family or friends who like to take pictures, they can find their own shooting angles here.
The summer vacation is coming, and I can't wait to bring my family here to experience it. I believe that here, we can all find that tranquility and beauty and spend an unforgettable holiday.

The hotel's travel photography service: The landscape photos taken by the Li River, every frame seems to be a poem of nature, and the effect is absolutely amazing! Especially the terrace on the sixth floor and the rooftop landscape swimming pool are excellent shooting spots, which make people can't help but press the shutter frequently.
The hotel's rooms are cleverly designed, and the river view rooms are even more praised. Looking from the room, the beautiful scenery of the Li River is unobstructed, without any obstruction, and the vision is wide, making people feel as if they are in a landscape painting. It is recommended that everyone must book a river view room to experience the unparalleled visual feast.
You can get up early in the morning and come to the terrace restaurant to enjoy breakfast while enjoying the beautiful sunrise. If you want to sleep in, don't worry about missing breakfast. The hotel will serve it until half past ten! And the breakfast variety is rich, whether it is the elderly or children, they can find their favorite flavors and eat them to their satisfaction.
The overall service of the hotel is also very good. The staff are warm and thoughtful, providing us with a satisfactory travel plan, making the whole trip smoother and more enjoyable. Here, we felt the warmth and comfort of home and spent an unforgettable time.

Here you can blend with the fragrance of books and tea by the Lijiang River. Fishing by the river, afternoon tea and coffee, or camping by the river. Immerse yourself in the slow life with good friends. It is a rare enjoyment. There is also ZUI Lijiang Restaurant on the sixth floor. It is also well-known locally. It has a good view and can overlook the Lijiang River without obstruction. However, it is often full, so you need to book in advance. The combination of beautiful scenery + delicious food is invincible! The rooftop swimming pool on the seventh floor allows you to enjoy the sunset of the Lijiang River while swimming. The laundry room, gym, and children's parent-child area are all very convenient. The hotel also provides special travel photography for free. There are many memorable makeups that leave local folk customs.

There are many locals eating in the terrace viewing restaurant on the sixth floor, so I know I came to the right place!
The Guilin rice noodles for breakfast are a big surprise, with a wide variety of varieties, rich taste, and super taste. The first meal every morning makes me feel full of happiness.
The design of the room is also very attentive, and every detail makes people feel comfortable and warm. Whether it is the scenery looking out of the window or the layout in the room, I have an urge to pick up the camera and take pictures immediately.
This hotel left a very deep impression on me. Whether it is the service, facilities or environment, I am very satisfied. I heard that they have 2 new stores in Yangshuo. Time is a problem. I will save it for next time.

msg:I, who never write reviews, must say a few words about this hotel.
Because it was May Day, I booked a room in advance. I thought the photos of this hotel were beautiful, so I booked it. I originally booked two rooms, but my friend suddenly fell ill. When I couldn't check out, the hotel heard that it was a special case and refunded one room. Three days before departure, the hotel butler called to confirm the itinerary, and then added WeChat and sent some tips and precautions, which made people feel very warm.
When I arrived in Guilin, because it was my first time in Guilin, I got the wrong hotel name and went to their Xiangshan Youyue Hotel. After finding out that I went to the wrong hotel, I saw that I brought my child and it was 10 o'clock in the evening, so I called Didi to send me here, and the car fare was paid.
Next, I stayed at Lijiang Courtyard. The hotel is not very big, but it has everything you need. You can see the Elephant Trunk Hill in the lobby on the first floor. It is super beautiful. The staff is very enthusiastic. After checking in, the front desk brother directly sent me to the elevator. On the way, he didn't forget to say that the water at the front desk is free and you can use it at will.
Because we were traveling with our kids, we booked a room with tatami. The waiter brought three quilts to sleep on the tatami, which was very comfortable. The cleaning lady was also very attentive. She saw that the tatami had added a bed. Starting from the next day, the water, slippers, toothbrushes, bath towels, etc. in the room were all placed for four people. It was really considerate.
I stayed here for three nights. When I checked out, I had to check out at 6 pm because of my reasons, so I called the front desk to ask for an extra half-day room fee, but the front desk lady said no, just let me pay some overtime money, saying that it was not cost-effective for me to pay an extra half-day room fee. This is too considerate of the customers.
How to say it, I have stayed in five-star hotels all over the country, and this hotel really made me feel what it means to be a guest at home. I feel that every staff member is seriously considering you. In a word, you will definitely stay here when you come to Guilin or have friends come to Guilin.

It felt like I was in a painting, and the people and the scenery were completely integrated. Then have a cup of pure hand-ground coffee afternoon tea, and enjoy it in the riverside curtains. It's so comfortable~
The breakfast variety in the restaurant in the morning is very rich. The Guilin rice noodles that must be punched in when you come to Guilin are eaten. It's delicious and I love it!

The store also provides free travel photography clothing, so you can take beautiful photos and check in! Everything is beautiful~ After taking photos, order pure hand-ground coffee, ‚òï paired with croissants, ü•ê Sitting in the Li River Riverside curtain specially set up by the hotel, the breeze gently brushed across my face, admiring the reflection of Fubo Mountain not far away in the emerald green Li River water. My sisters were envious when I posted the photos to Moments.
I have never stayed in a hotel where I can reach the Li River with my hands, and the experience is simply full! Next time I come to Guilin, I will choose this hotel again!

msg:Because of this hotel, I felt that it was a worthwhile trip to Guilin. The scenery seen in the hotel was even more beautiful than the Elephant Trunk Mountain Scenic Area.

You can see mountains and rivers from your room, and you can feed fish and fish by the river;
The breakfast is also rich, as well as the local specialty snack oil tea;
The service attitude of the front desk and the butler is very good. The butler will take the initiative to ask what services are needed from time to time. Especially the service attitude of an aunt at breakfast is even more speechless. She can't wait to feed the rice to her mouth hahaha;
There are no routines for travel photography, there are clothes to choose from, and all the negatives are included! And it‚Äôs not like the kind of assembly-line shooting in outside photo studios, where 19 out of 20 photos can be posted to WeChat Moments.

msg:The hotel is located in Diecai District, Guilin, on the edge of the Li River. The location is very good, and it is also very close to the East and West Alley. The hotel provides free fishing and feeding fish. I thought that only those staying in the hotel can fish, but this is not the case. Because the hotel is right next to the Li River, when I wanted to go over to watch, several people were sitting fishing and blocking the path I was walking through. The path was only about 50 centimeters wide. People sitting there fishing had to step across. One of them The old man asked me not to go there, and I argued with him. This is very different from the fishing scene shot in the promotion. And that man was not staying in the hotel at all. He was a local and he could enter the hotel and fish at will. Is this the fishing provided by the hotel? The soundproofing of the hotel also needs to be improved. The sound of going up and down the stairs would be transmitted to the room, which affected my rest. The hotel restaurant has a nice view and the breakfast is okay. Room service is very good and replies quickly. There are free clothes to wear and shoot.

As the most beautiful hotel beside the Li River and Fubo Mountain, in addition to having a large terrace with super beautiful scenery, the hotel also has a swimming pool on the top floor with beautiful views. Sitting on the terrace of the hotel, tasting delicious food, and admiring the beautiful scenery of the Li River and Fubo Mountain is really a kind of enjoyment. The hotel's room package also provides landscape travel photography, which can record the beautiful scenery of the Li River. It's a pity that due to the large number of people, the travel photography was not arranged, which is a regret of this trip!

msg:This time I stayed in three hotels in Yangshuo, Guilin, and this one is the best one!
The night before check-in, the housekeeper calls to inquire about the check-in time, and then adds WeChat to send relevant information. In fact, many hotels have this service, but not many hotels insist on it!
On the day of check-in, we arrived at the hotel at around 11 o'clock. To be honest, I didn't have high hopes for checking in right away (our domestic hotels are now in line with international standards and basically require check-in at 2 pm, and some even ask for check-in at 3 o'clock). Unexpectedly The hotel immediately gave me the room!
There is a corner opposite the front desk of the hotel, which provides fruits, biscuits, and hot tea. This is not unique. The small compar**ent next to it provides headbands, masks, band-aids, cotton pads, hydrating spray, toilet mats, sanitary napkins... very little bits and pieces. Complete, this service is relatively small.
When you check in, you will receive welcome coffee and snacks. The coffee is as delicious as those in coffee shops!
I asked the housekeeper to take me to see a room with a 270-degree full river view, and then I paid to upgrade to this room because this room type is really amazing. I fell in love with it at first sight!
Although the room is large, I touched several places that I thought would be ignored by ordinary hotels - there was no floating dust! Even if I touched the upper shelf of the shelf next to the bed, there was no dust! This is really rare. The last one was at the Mandarin Oriental in Taipei several years ago! So you can throw your clothes around as you like because they are all clean!
Facilities: There is a washlet (I asked later not all rooms have it, only the ones with river views). The most surprising thing is that there are alcohol pads next to the toilet! I actually always bring one because my first priority is to clean the toilet seat, and this is the first one that provides it!
The only one in this trip that has a Dyson hair dryer, and it‚Äôs not locked (yes, there are locked hotels)!
The next day I discovered that there was a garment steamer. Hotels that provide irons have them, but this was the first time I saw a garment steamer!
The shower room actually has two showers, hehe!
The minibar provides free potato chips, crackers, Lijiang beer, coconut water, sparkling water, etc., as well as two bottles of voss, not to mention the bottled water available in the hotel corridor (I really can‚Äôt stand those who just ask for a few bottles of water) What a ridiculous hotel!) When I first checked in, I asked the butler if the minibar was free. The butler said that everything provided in the room was free!
120-inch projection, the best thing is that it can be projected onto the screen! That night, the two of them binge-watched dramas until almost 12 o'clock.
The large bathtub is for surfing. You can see Fubo Mountain when you lie in it. You can't soak in it during the day. There is a window of the room diagonally opposite, so you can't see it when you turn off the lights at night.
There are many lighting modes and a**ospheres. You can adjust the brightness of the room at will. It will be bright and bright when all are turned on! The lighting control is also very considerate, that is, the light in the toilet room will still be on after the main control is turned off! There are too many hotels where everything goes completely dark once you turn off the main control. The fat guy and I often turn off the main control and turn the light switch on again in the bathroom! This problem is solved perfectly here! Moreover, in some hotels such as Banyan Tree Yangshuo, if you want to leave the light on the toilet, you must also leave the light in the bathroom on, and then it will be very bright and affect your sleep...
The service is also very good. The butler answers all questions. In the evening, he will also ask if the temperature is suitable. He said that there are two kinds of thick and thin quilts, which is rare. It was almost too hot to death at the Banyan Tree!
When ordering takeout, the robot will deliver it to your room, so you don‚Äôt have to go downstairs to get it yourself. It‚Äôs really convenient!
If I really had to pick something that could be improved, it would be the breakfast. It was a little simple, but for a hotel with few rooms, a buffet like this is pretty good! Especially the Guilin rice noodles are pretty good, and the fruits are great! I really want to know which supplier! The mandarin oranges are sweet, the cantaloupe is sweet, and even the fragrant pears are the sweetest I have ever tasted! Banyan Tree, please change the supplier, your fruit is too unpalatable!
Needless to say about the location of the hotel, it is probably the closest hotel to the Li River. You can go down the steps to the Li River. The hotel also provides free fishing!
By the way, I also received a small gift bag of snacks when I checked in, and a mangosteen fruit souvenir when I checked out!
Before coming to Guilin, I booked Boyin and Shiyuyuanfang, and wanted to compare them, because I felt they were very similar before, but now I feel that Shiyuyuanfang is far better than Boyin, and the latter is really not comparable at all!
It can be said that this hotel is the biggest highlight of my trip to Guilin and Yangshuo! What a beautiful ending!
The only hope is that I can keep it going...

In addition, the hotel's facilities are relatively new and very clean. The surrounding environment is also very good. There are also various swimming experiences such as fishing in the Li River. It is suitable for in-depth tours in Guilin, parent-child tours, bringing parents, or traveling alone to relax, etc. Meet various experience needs.

We stayed on the tatami and slept with three children who loved to roll over. The waiter specially gave us 5 quilts. The children were so busy that they didn‚Äôt want to go home.

The location is also excellent. Fubo Mountain Park is just outside the door. The children (7/4/1.5 years old) had a lot of fun. You can also walk directly to the Elephant Trunk Mountain Scenic Area. There are markets on the road and you can take a boat ride. It only takes ten minutes to take a ride back to the hotel.

I will book a river view room next time I come, it will be super beautiful!

The best thing is that the 3rd floor of the hotel is a bubble pool. Adults can have a quiet meal on the 6th floor. This design is very considerate.

It only takes more than ten minutes to get to the hotel from the North High-speed Railway Station. I took a Didi taxi for only RMB 12, but I booked it. The hotel pick-up and drop-off service was 80 yuan. Forget it, the person who came was still a poor person, and his service attitude was still very poor. He kept calling me and asked me to find him outside the North Station. Where could I find him as a foreigner? I know Guilin so well. What do I want you to do? When I arrived at the hotel, I opened the curtains and faced the street. I was speechless. Then I ran to the front desk and asked if they could change me to a house facing the river. The front desk said yes, but it would cost an additional 1,000 yuan or 2,000 yuan. It was quite expensive. He kindly told me that he could give me a discount. It was only 700 yuan. The room I booked half a month in advance was more than 900 yuan. Good guy, this hotel will kill me and I won‚Äôt come back next time. I‚Äôm in a good traveling mood. destroyed.

And the hotel is in a very good location. You can directly see the Li River, Fubo Mountain and Fulongzhou Park. The beautiful scenery is all in front of you! !
The facilities in the room are also very complete~ There are also complimentary snacks, and the front desk service is also superb and comprehensive. It is not too considerate.
We stayed in a river view room, and the river view at a glance was really comfortable. The room had a bathtub and bath supplies were prepared. I was a little tired after playing for several days, so I just wanted to take a bath and relax.

The balcony of the room overlooks the beautiful scenery of the Li River. It is especially suitable for taking pictures and checking in. If the weather is good, you can see Guilin from the balcony. The sun rises over the Li River. The equipment in the room is particularly complete. Everything can be tried for free, as well as smart home appliances. The hotel also provides free freshly ground coffee and travel photography. I sit in the coffee bar on the first floor and drink freshly ground coffee. Eating afternoon tea and admiring the beautiful scenery of the Li River in spring, I felt extremely relaxed physically and mentally. For hotel travel photography, you need to make an appoin**ent one day in advance. The photographer has very good photography skills. Because the hotel is right on the Li River, it is particularly good at producing photos. The photographer took us We took photos at several check-in points (the courtyard on the first floor, the Lijiang River Plank Road, the restaurant terrace on the 6th floor, the swimming pool, etc.). Travel photography is free. Important things must be mentioned three times!!! The hotel is not far from various scenic spots and the city center. , it only takes about 15 minutes to walk. The hotel‚Äôs breakfast also has a wide variety of varieties, which is very local. I highly recommend Guilin rice noodles! The butler's service is also very good. If you have any questions, you can ask the butler. I like this hotel very much.

msg:[Highly recommended when traveling to Guilin] After choosing this hotel online for a long time, I finally chose this hotel by the Li River. The housekeeper contacted us before we arrived and was very enthusiastic to provide us with all kinds of help. The free parking lot is opposite the hotel. After arriving at the hotel, I discovered that this hotel is really right on the Li River. You can see the beautiful Li River through the lobby on the first floor. Because the room type you booked before did not have a view of the Li River, I paid extra to upgrade to a balcony river view room. The view is really great. , you can overlook the beautiful scenery of the entire Li River and Fulongzhou from the balcony, which is especially suitable for taking pictures. The hotel also gave us freshly ground coffee as a gift. We drank the freshly ground coffee from the coffee boy, ate delicious afternoon tea, and sat on the Lijiang River. It's great to enjoy the beautiful scenery of the Li River. The hotel also provides free travel photography. The photography guy is very professional and took us to several special photo spots to take photos (rooftop swimming pool, restaurant terrace, Li River Plank Road), hotel rooms The equipment is very complete, and the drinks in the refrigerator are free and plentiful. In particular, the breakfast in this hotel is really delicious and has local characteristics. There are Guilin rice noodles, camellia, etc. You can also see the entire breakfast in the restaurant. The location of the hotel is also very good for the Li River and Fubo Mountain. It is not far from the scenic spots and the city center of Guilin. It only takes 10-15 minutes to walk. The hotel also provides fishing gear. If you have nothing to do, you can go to the river directly from the side door of the hotel. While fishing, I like this hotel very much. I highly recommend it to everyone. The service is perfect!

msg:First of all, a big thumbs up
Before coming here, I really didn‚Äôt have high expectations. In the past, hotels in scenic spots were not good in all aspects, especially the environment and service attitude. The advantage is that I can be closer to the scenic spot and avoid unnecessary trips, so I decided to do this this time. I was at odds with my wife for a while before making the decision, but fortunately she obeyed and was able to eliminate my many years of worries and doubts about scenic hotels. Of course, maybe it's just that the "Poetry and Distance" hotel did it right.
It was raining heavily when we arrived and we couldn't find the intersection of the parking lot, so we sent a WeChat message to the housekeeper we contacted. Unexpectedly, we got a call back immediately and told us that they were waiting for you at the door. When we saw their figures, we were really surprised. I was very touched. There was a kind of warmth when I opened the umbrella in my hand. Maybe at this time they represented not only the hotel but "Guilin". When we entered the hotel, they explained the hotel's various services and facilities to us very carefully. They also asked us many times whether we felt any physical or other discomfort due to being exposed to the rain, and whether we needed hot water or other services. To be honest, we had not paid and booked the room at that time, and it was these that made us have to choose. Stay here to experience the wonderful life. My wife and I were shocked when we saw the upgraded room for us. It can only be described as "intimate". It really gives you what you need. Please look at the pictures for the environment.
I really write these words from the bottom of my heart. I would like to thank all the hotel staff again for their service to us. When my family and I come to Guilin again in the near future, I believe this will be our choice with closed eyes; Because I'm home.

msg:After repeated screening on Ctrip, we finally chose a resort hotel with beautiful scenery, delicious food, comfortable rooms, and good service. We finally chose Lijiang Courtyard and stayed there without any surprises. It was a very good accommodation experience! Special thanks to the receptionist for her patient explanation and considerate service. The hotel is in an excellent location, right next to Fubo Mountain. From the window, you can see the beautiful Li River and the mountain peaks in the distance. It is so beautiful. Guests can even see the excellent scenery at the Lijiang Restaurant on the sixth floor. It is different in morning and evening, and it is rainy. Different weather means different kinds of beauty. In particular, the Lijiang River is of high quality in terms of ingredients, cooking, and service. This hotel is located in the best scenic spot, close to Fulongzhou Park, the cruise ship terminal and Zhengyang Pedestrian Street. The Cultural Palace and the East and West Alleys are very close. The facilities of the hotel are complete and very new. The rooms are very large, very clean and refreshing. The service of the hotel front desk and the butler is very good. Any needs are basically responded to and met quickly. The lobby on the first floor is the Lijiang Courtyard. It has a great view on the side of the Lijiang River. Next to it is the coffee bar. It is very comfortable to drink coffee and look at the scenery during your leisure time. It is very comfortable to relax your body and mind. It was a very comfortable stay, cost-effective, highly recommended!

I have never been tempted by other apps. I believe that Ctrip believes that many players and friends will come to Guilin. I stayed at this hotel for two nights. First of all, the scenery is great. There are two rivers and four lakes next to it. The viewing restaurant in the evening is a check-in spot for many Internet celebrities. The key is that the food tastes very good. I ordered a few dishes that tasted greatüëç. Secondly, the service The details are beyond imagination.

Children who want to stay there don't want to go to Yangshuo. I will choose this place when I come to Guilin in the future!

msg:The room is large and spacious, and the bed is also big. It feels pleasant to stay there. The view of the river outside the window is average, maybe because of the angle, the view is not very good. Maybe it would be better if you turn a few rooms over and you should be able to see more of the water. As for the floor tiles in the room, there should be local floor heating in several places, which is relatively comfortable. The service is very good. The housekeeper has added WeChat before. The room tidying service and the breakfast room waiter will take the initiative to ask about the stay experience. The breakfast is average, not very rich, and is a bit weak compared to the price of 2,300 per night, but the snail noodles are delicious, which makes up for the lack of variety. There are two things that I am not satisfied with: the temperature is on the high side, but the air conditioner is not turned on yet, so it is still a bit hot at night, which is also a common problem in many hotels in winter; the second is because the bathroom is connected to the room, which is very transparent. But if someone gets up early to wash up and the light is not blocked, it will have a greater impact on those who haven‚Äôt gotten up yet. In addition, the light from the electric light panel is still a little bright at night. Overall very good. Will stay again if I come again.

msg:[Comments from 8419 Beijing guests who stayed between 2.3 and 2.5]
After a busy year, I took my two daughters to Guilin for vacation before the Spring Festival. Because of its quiet environment, close proximity to the river and mountains, convenient transportation, and tranquility amidst the hustle and bustle, I chose the "Poetry and Distance" (Lijiang Courtyard) hotel located at the foot of Fubo Mountain.
It was an unforgettable and heartwarming experience. Although it has been rainy and cold in Guilin these past few days, the care and professional services provided by all the hotel staff made us feel extra warm and comfortable.
The young lady at the front desk who did not want to leave her name started the first part of this pleasant journey for us with her serious and professional service. Whether it was checking in or checking information, she did a skillful and meticulous job, which made us deeply impressed. Feel safe and assured. When I checked in, I saw that I was bringing my two children and they upgraded us to a large viewing suite for free. The three rooms in the hotel all had large floor-to-ceiling bay windows that surprised me. As soon as they entered the door, the children went "crazy" with joy. The whole house creates a comfortable a**osphere that makes me feel at home. Dyson appliances, TOTO smart sanitary ware, the automatic opening function of curtains, and robots delivering food to the room make us deeply feel the convenience of technology and humanized care.
In addition, the room and travel services are highly praised. They not only promptly sent us children's slippers and toothbrushes, but also carefully replenished various snacks and drinks in the refrigerator (all for free). This thoughtfulness made us Extremely touched. The room temperature is also controlled just right. Pajamas, slippers, tea sets, bedding and other equipment and facilities are all available. The details highlight the hotel's careful consideration and quality. The hotel provided services throughout our trip, including booking tickets, calling taxis, and consulting, without any sales promotion.
Every morning, we can enjoy a rich and delicious breakfast. The wide variety of choices meets the needs of my various tastes, and not only satisfies my appetite. Seeing that it was inconvenient for me to take care of my baby, he specially helped us pick up meals and deliver them to the table, and enthusiastically recommended the taste and eating methods of local specialties, making us feel at home.
Interlude: I accidentally broke a delicate little jar of bath salts. When I offered to compensate, the lady at the front desk who helped me check in was first concerned about not hurting the child, and said that there was no need to compensate, and that the guest experience would be the best. Importantly, I also gave a souvenir from the hotel. When I asked her name, she only said: "Just call me Xiaoshi. Xiaoshi represents all our employees." This made me and the children feel moved.
In general, the high-quality service, comfortable environment, humanized technological facilities, and professional and attentive service of the "Poetry and Distance" (Lijiang Courtyard) hotel made us feel like home. Here, I would like to thank all the service staff called "Xiaoshi" for their meticulous care and help. You made this trip so warm and unforgettable. This stay not only made us very satisfied, but also gave us a deep love and respect for the "little poems" in the hotel. I would definitely recommend this place to others.

Thank you "Poetry and Distance" (Lijiang Courtyard) Hotel, and I look forward to meeting you next time!

The hotel is surrounded by mountains and rivers, and the scenery is unique. It deserves to be called Poetry and Distance. The beautiful Li River is at the foot of the hotel. You can only experience it when you are there. It's pure and beautiful. The air in Guilin is really good. It's an experience I don't have in big cities. I saw too many high-rise buildings and lived in the Lijiang Courtyard. In fact, I didn't have the desire to go out. After experiencing the afternoon tea in the hotel, it reminded me of the Forbidden City. The afternoon teas are all new Chinese-style refreshments, which are not only good to watch but also delicious! We also tried the signature dishes of the rooftop restaurant with a view. The beef ribs are large enough and tender, and the snail meat is a must-try! This dish cannot be eaten in other places. You must also eat clay pot Lipu taro. You must eat local food when you come to Guilin. And I saw many locals eating in their restaurant. The business is not bad. If I hadn't only stayed in Guilin for one day, I would have wished for two more meals. The first and sixth floors of the hotel have great views. It's perfect for taking pictures. The Li River is right in front of you, and you can see the mountains in the distance! If you choose a room with larger floor-to-ceiling windows, you will really feel like sleeping on the Li River. I like Guilin so much! I love poetry and the distance. The hotel staff are kind and loving, the rooms are clean and sanitary, and all the necessary facilities and equipment are available, and friends! There are enough sugar oranges and kumquats to live here! Really don't want to leave! Leave some regrets, see you next time in poetry and the distance ~

This hotel is more clean than the one in the picture. The mountain view room faces the military. There is a lights-out signal at night and a wake-up signal in the morning. It faces the street and is still very noisy even after ten o'clock in the evening.
The soundproofing of the room is not good either. I can hear people talking in the corridor very clearly.
The platform bed is particularly awkward for my legs.
The Guilin rice noodles for breakfast really don‚Äôt taste good.
Although there is a butler service, it is far inferior to similar B&Bs in other areas.
I booked a ferry ticket to Yangshuo with the butler. The connection method for picking up the ticket at the pier was unclear, and the person who gave the ticket had a very bad attitude.
I was given Luo Han Guo tea when I left the store, which was a thoughtful service.
The guy at the front desk in the afternoon on the day of check-in had better service and reminded me of the business hours of different entrances to Elephant Trunk Hill Park.
If there are other places, don‚Äôt choose Guilin. It‚Äôs really a trap throughout the whole journey.

I was checking in in the lobby with my child asleep in my arms. I was told that there was no room and it had not been cleaned. I had to wait for an hour. Normal guests check out at 2 o'clock, but you're telling me that they haven't been cleaned yet? Is it okay to upgrade? Suddenly I was told that I had a room, which was strange. Later, I was told that you can also delay check-out for 100 an hour, but you have to give a positive review on Ctrip before you can get a free delay. I understand why it is so hard to check in at 4:30 and there is no room, and I also understand how this high score comes from. I hope the store can provide basic services well and don't rely on these small tricks to improve scores. It's not a long-term solution. The store owner should not contact me to ask me to change the review! ! ! ! !

Environment: To be honest, entering from the door is a bit anti-human. You have to bypass a set of screens to enter the elevator. Maybe the hotel is afraid of outsiders entering? If so, I suggest the hotel reuse the device in the elevator that allows you to swipe your card to go upstairs.
Service: The service is very good. The only drawback is the place where you enter at the door.

The hotel ranking and price are seriously inconsistent with the actual situation: first, the sound insulation is extremely poor, and the sound of walking upstairs is like rolling stones. The sound of the shower is like the sound of an airplane engine; secondly, the air conditioner is very noisy, and the lowest speed is still very noisy, and it is located just above the head, so I dare not turn it on; thirdly, there is a problem with the bed design in the room. In the picture, even the waiter said that he was often knocked. Fourth, the light was set at the head of the bed, and there was always light at night unless the card was not inserted. Fifth, the shampoo was too often. The only good thing is that the waiter's service is very good.

The super five-star service, sanitation, and hardware facilities make the body and mind completely liberated. The location of the hotel is really good. The Lijiang River and Fubo Mountain are within easy reach. The Jingjiang Palace and East and West Lanes are within walking distance. The night view of the Lijiang River is also unobstructed from the hotel. The facilities are very new, the bedding is comfortable, and the service is excellent! There is also a self-service plum soup and fruit in the lobby. The swimming pool on the 7th floor and the children's playground on the third floor are very suitable for children. They are reluctant to leave after playing. This time I took the children very much. Wall Crack recommends those who come to travel to stay! (PS: When I arrived at the hotel, I paid to upgrade to a larger room with a bathtub, children can play in the water, and the window view is even bigger!)

First, the geographical location is superior, close to the downtown, convenient to go to Xiangshan, two rivers and four lakes wharf, convenient travel. The second is that although the hotel is not a high-rise building and there are not many rooms, it is very creative.

The room I stayed in faced the road and had no view, because the hardware facilities were really good, but also because of the size of the room and the view, the price of nearly 800 was a bit expensive.
If you ignore the price, it is more recommended to stay in a river view room, which is the advantage of this hotel.

msg:Everyone was very pleasantly surprised. I didn't expect that the hotel looks ordinary on the outside, but the inside is so artistic. The room space is exaggerated. If you ignore the old buildings in front of the landscape, it is quite shocking. The hotel restaurant has a great a**osphere and the food is good. The service attitude of the whole hotel is super warm and friendly. I only stayed for one night, so I was a little reluctant to leave. There are East and West Alleys nearby, and you can walk to Diecai Mountain and Xiangshan Mountain, but we set off for Yangshuo the next day, so we didn't play.

Fubo Mountain is right next to the hotel, and the Lijiang River flows in front of the hotel. The public areas of the hotel are also great. Have an afternoon tea in the lobby on the first floor, or go fishing, have an exquisite and authentic meal in the restaurant on the sixth floor, and there is an infinity pool on the seventh floor. It is really good to choose this hotel when you come to Guilin It's just right.

I booked a parent-child suite. The children had a great time. The front desk service of the hotel is very good! Although I didn't book a river view room, the restaurant on the 6th floor has a really good view. The restaurant's products are good, and the price is a little expensive, but the view and service are also worthy of the price. The playground is a bit smaller and there are fewer items to play, but overall I am satisfied. The intelligent robot delivers meals and items in the room, give it a thumbs up üëç!

I read online reviews that this hotel is by the Li River, which is especially suitable for vacation. Called to understand the situation, and finally booked it. The hotel's decoration style is very charming, the log material is very environmentally friendly, and the hotel's aromatherapy is also very tasteful. The location of the hotel is good. You can walk to Pedestrian Street, Elephant Trunk Hill, and Jingjiang Palace. The room is well-equipped, and there is a big tatami mat, which is very nice. Drinking tea on the tatami mat makes you feel comfortable in a daze~ Breakfast is at the restaurant on the 6th floor. The scenery is beautiful. Now Guilin is a bit smoky and rainy like a splash-ink painting. You can go fishing in the hotel üé£, and there are also free clothes rentals for travel photography. It's so nice~ Anyway, I really like this store, and I recommend it to everyone

msg:When I came to Guilin, I always wanted to find a hotel by the Lijiang River. Finally, I settled on the Shihe Yuanfang Lijiang Courtyard Hotel. I called the front desk to inquire about it. The front desk sent a Ctrip reservation code and booked it without hesitation. After adding the butler's WeChat account, the butler sent me the location of the hotel, the hotel information and the location of the parking lot. It was really considerate. The advance service has already made me feel good about this hotel. When we arrive at the hotel, the parking lot is opposite the hotel, which is very large. Because the hotel is by the river, it is understandable that the parking lot cannot be on the same side. Entering the hotel is really unique, one step at a time, this is my favorite style. The river view king bed room I chose should be the most cost-effective. Not only can you enjoy the river view at a moderate price, but the entire room is also well-equipped. The details of the room are also very careful, and the drinks in the small refrigerator are free. The swimming pool on the top floor can be said to be the commanding height for taking pictures, and the scenery of the entire river bank can be seen at a glance. I also saw flocks of white birds flying over the river, so close to nature. Friends who like ecological beauty and nature, this one is really worth buying.

And the parking lot is very large, not a public parking lot, and I saw several RVs parked, which is cool. The restaurant is on the sixth floor of the hotel. The breakfast is rich and unique. If you wake up early, you can see the sunrise upstairs! The view on the roof is beautiful, and the swimming pool on the seventh floor will have a better view. It seems that guests who stay in the hotel can only use their cards. In the evening, the restaurant still entertained warmly even when it was close to closing time, and the products were good. I ate the must-eat beer fish in Guilin, Lipu taro, and I forgot the names of a few dishes. It is the second time I will eat in Guilin. The location of the hotel is very good. It is very close to the Elephant Trunk Hill and the Two Rivers and Four Lakes Pedestrian Street. The design of the hotel is very charming, the room type is grand, and the Lijiang River is outside the window. The service is very good and I am satisfied. I will stay at the hotel again when I come to Guilin. I highly recommend it !

But after looking at other rooms facing the Li River, I finally chose to pay the difference and upgrade to a balcony river view room. There is no shelter to see the Li River! The air in Guilin is really good, and the ecology is also good. Recently, the weather is blowing on the balcony. Watching the cruise ships on the Li River move slowly, it doesn‚Äôt feel too wonderful~ Fishing in the hotel is free, and you can go down the stairs on the first floor to the Li River. This is the resort hotel of my dreams. If I have time to live in Guilin for a while, I will definitely come back here! One is because the location is good and the environment is good, and the other is because the professional and considerate staff makes me feel very warm. I am away from home, thank you for taking care of me! By the way, I recommend the signature dish of the restaurant, I will eat it next time I come

Traveling is not just going from a place where I am tired of staying to a place where others are tired of staying, so I want to experience whether it is the poem and the distance I yearn for~ To be honest, the overall stay After coming down, I am quite satisfied with all aspects of Shihe Yuanfang Hotel. First of all, the butler service. Before check-in, the butler will call to inquire about the check-in time. After adding it to their WeChat, Xiaoshi will take the initiative to introduce the hotel, ask about the needs in detail, and what can be provided Will try to help as much as possible, which is very commendable! The second location, the hotel is next to the Fubo Mountain Park in the city center, next to the Lijiang River, there is a staircase on the first floor to walk directly to the Lijiang River, chirping birds or playing in the branches, groups of egrets, wild ducks playing in the water, Unexpectedly, the ecological environment is so good, and the fisherman fishing alone on the opposite oasis, the picture is amazing! The landscape swimming pool on the top floor is also very amazing. When the weather is good, various films are produced, but it is not warm enough to swim in the water. . . The scenic spots in Guilin are basically about 2 kilometers away. You can walk along Zhengyang Pedestrian Street and Dongxi Lane Pedestrian Street next to it. You can also walk along Binjiang Road to Xiaoyao Building in Dongxi Lane. The night view of Jiefang Bridge is amazing! You can also walk to Elephant Trunk Hill. Not far from Elephant Trunk Hill is the Sun and Moon Twin Pagodas. In short, shopping is very convenient. For dinner, ZUI Lijiang Restaurant on the sixth floor (the view on the large terrace is amazing!) and Xinguoji Oil Tea are very close. Just 3 minutes walk!

The opposite bank of the river is full of lights; it can be seen that the hotel is well-designed, elegant and comfortable; breakfast is on the top floor: rich in variety and delicious, with many choices; in addition, the ZUI Lijiang restaurant has very good products, and you can enjoy the scenery of the Lijiang River while tasting food. There are tatami mats in the room, you can drink tea and watch the river view, you can also go to the terrace on the sixth floor to enjoy the night, or have afternoon tea in the yard on the first floor, very enjoyable! Facilities: All kinds of basic skills and facilities are complete, very convenient.

msg:When I checked in on the first day, the hotel staff who helped me check in took my ID card and laughed in a low voice and said "I'm from Henan" in a very low voice, and then laughed. I asked her what was wrong and she said it was nothing.
The above experience made me very unhappy. What‚Äôs so funny about it? I spent 1,698 a night in a hotel and still get laughed at by the staff? Is this regional discrimination? The quality of your hotel staff is not as good as that of ordinary B&B staff. Is authentication related to address? Why are you still reading these messages? With this kind of quality, who knows if you will steal and sell personal information.
And after leaving the hotel, the waiter at the hotel door didn't know how to help with the luggage, and was playing with his mobile phone nearby. If the hotel staff are not properly trained, then don‚Äôt open a store and just sell Guilin rice noodles.
The privacy of the room is very poor. I was sitting on the sofa on the balcony, and the man in the room next to me could see the whole inside of the room when he poked his head over. There was no privacy at all, which made the room feel unsafe.
The picture of the room booked does not match the actual situation. The bathtub in the hotel picture is a round double bathtub, but it is actually a single bathtub. The picture shows a screen, but there is actually nothing.
I have stayed in so many four- and five-star hotels, but this hotel alone has the worst experience! The only negative review! If Guilin does not welcome outsiders, it is best to promote it, especially not to let people from Henan come to play.

This time a friend came to Guilin to play, and I helped him book this hotel again. The hotel is right next to the Li River, in the city center, so it's very convenient to go anywhere. Friends said that the room is very big and the bed is super big. I had misunderstood the type of bed before, but now it is a 2.4-meter super-large bed with a layer of latex pad on the bed, which is completely seamless and sleeps very comfortably. There is also an oversized tatami in the room, which is great for drinking tea and enjoying the scenery. Because it is winter, some trees have not yet sprouted new buds, but it does not affect the leisure mood. There is a terrace viewing restaurant on the 6th floor of the hotel with a very wide view. The business of the restaurant is very good. Not only the hotel guests will go up to eat, but also the local guests and the guests who don‚Äôt stay in the hotel. Therefore, the waiting time for the elevator will be longer. Two elevators are also suitable for a small hotel like this. In any case, the service of the hotel is still top-notch. They take good care of their friends and they are very satisfied.

Regardless of the beautiful scenery and beautiful rooms, it makes people linger and forget to return. Xiaolan Huilin Meimei‚Äôs service is very good.

msg:The location of the hotel is excellent, next to Fubo Park on the banks of the Lijiang River, very close to the popular attractions in the city, and you can see the night view of the Lijiang River from the tatami in the room at night.
The products of the room service and the restaurant are very good. When the water in the room is not enough to drink, you can take it by yourself in the elevator room on each floor. There is also a gift when you leave the store. It is very rare that the service quality can still be maintained during the peak period of the Spring Festival.
4 points for the facility is that the sound insulation of the guest room is slightly poor, and it would be better to add a partition outside the bathroom

I don‚Äôt know if the car next door didn‚Äôt pay attention to opening and closing the door or the strong wind blew. The passenger door was knocked into two holes, and the sheet metal was damaged.

msg:I didn't have much expectations. I saw the hotel's style and price and booked a twin room, but the poem and the distant Lijiang yard can be said to surprise me, and it actually looks better than the pictures I saw online. The double bed I booked did not see the river view, but the weather was sunny in the past two days. I didn‚Äôt want to live up to the beautiful scenery outside the window. With the mentality of ‚Äúcome here‚Äù, I resolutely upgraded a suite with the best view, 270¬∞ You can see the Li River. Let me tell you how I feel:
1. [Hotel Facilities] The sanitation details of the room are very well done, and you will feel at ease when you enter; the drinks in the minibar are free; there are 2 kinds of slippers, and I like them with texture; there is a self-service on the third floor of the hotel The laundry and drying service is very convenient for those of us who often go out; the swimming pool is on the roof, which is quite unique. It is not used in this season, and it should be a good experience when the weather is warm; the gym is also equipped, and the overall Good facilities
2. [Scenery] The river view is invincible, whether it is the view of the room or the view of the first floor, or even the river view of the sixth floor. First of all, the scenery of the Lijiang River yard on the first floor is like a back garden. There are also flowers, and you will go to the Lijiang River when you go down the stairs. The point is that you can fish for free! A bit too surprised haha, there are quite a few people fishing; the sixth floor and the seventh floor overlook the Li River, and it is very good to take pictures and punch cards;
3. [Food] Breakfast is on the sixth floor. You can watch the sunrise and sunset. There are many kinds of self-service options, both Chinese and Western, and even local special oil tea. . The rice noodles are delicious and look very authentic; I checked the strategy and found that the zui Lijiang restaurant on the sixth floor of the hotel turned out to be a local Internet celebrity restaurant. Special features, Italian black vinegar sweet and sour pork ribs, Lipu taro, etc. are also delicious, and it is estimated that they can only be eaten in Guilin; hotel guests can also get a 10% discount, and enjoy the beautiful scenery while eating, which is very satisfying.
4. [Service] From check-in to check-out, the service is in place. Whether it was the housekeeper at the front desk or the restaurant in the guest room, they all gave people a very cordial feeling. If the fruit was delicious, he sent me a plate to the room, which was very attentive. In addition, there are professional travel butlers in the store who can customize the tour for us. There is no need to rush the itinerary with the group. We can formulate the tour route according to our requirements, which is very good!
5. [Location] The hotel is located in the city center, it is not far to go to Xiangbishan Park, Dongxixiang Pedestrian Street, and Zhengyang Pedestrian Street, and there are shared electric vehicles at the door, which is convenient for travel. The hotel provides free parking and parking lot. It is also very large (it is very convenient to do nucleic acid, you can walk to the second people's hospital next to it in 2 minutes, which is very convenient).
[Summary] Poetry is incomparable to the scenery of the Lijiang yard in the distance, with complete facilities, various types of food, and hotel services that make people feel warm. In a short trip to Guilin, I encountered a hotel full of temperature, which is also the icing on the cake for my trip. .

There were people fishing üé£ playing in the water all night. It's not noisy, and the hotel also has fishing trips. But I was lazy and didn't go in the end. When I was choosing a room, I was torn between a room with a balcony or a full-face window. Husband said that there is a balcony for smoking, and finally found this option to be great. Sleep in a landscape painting and wait for the sunrise with a cup of hot tea. Really enjoyed it. It's a pity that it's cloudy today, and I only see a little bit of light in the sky...
The only downside of the room is the open bathroom. It's a bit embarrassing to go to the toilet at night, for fear of waking up the sleeping person. There is no bathtub in this roomüõÅ.

The location is very good, the service is very good, especially Xiaoyanzi, who is kind and thoughtful, helps to order afternoon tea, and helps to solve all problems! I am a detail control, and I hate hotels or famous hotels that take beautiful pictures but not the actual details! This one almost makes me impeccable! The room is very big, especially the mineral water, fruit and disinfectant wipes are provided at the entrance of each floor, which is really considerate! I especially love drinking tea. I often stay in a hotel and ask the waiter to deliver water many times. Although the water is not expensive, it will be a little psychological burden if I ask for it too many times! How can I say it, the food is delicious, the afternoon tea is good-looking, the swimming pool is small but beautiful, the room is very large and comfortable, and the 270-degree view is amazing!

msg:Initially, I booked the Shiyuyuanfang double room. After checking in, I found that the room facing the street was also very small. I temporarily increased the price for a total price of 2199 and switched to a first-line Lijiang live broadcast double room. The view of the Lijiang River from the room was average and the river channel was very narrow. On one section, there is a row of old houses on the other side, which is disappointing, but the room itself is not bad, with a big bathtub, and the service of the lady at the front desk is also good. In terms of transportation, this house is far away from the tourist spots in the main city. It is on a small road and is surrounded by residential areas. You have to take a taxi to get to the Sun Moon Tower Xiangshan Park, which is very inconvenient...
Generally speaking, the price-performance ratio is very low. I originally booked two nights, but I canceled the second night and switched to the Grand Falls Hotel in the city center. The room was a bit old, but when I opened the window, I could see the wide view of the Li River and the Sun and Moon Twin Towers. The river view room The price is only over 800, which is great value.

The hotel facilities are OK, but there are no chairs in the room, the hygiene is quite clean, and there is a small robot in the lobby that can deliver food. The lady at the front desk, Xiaolan, and Xiaoyanzi are very nice people. I would like to give them a thumbs up.

The little brother at the front desk was very considerate when checking in, and Xiaoyanzi and Xiaolan quickly responded to the various needs of the guests. It is obvious that the overall service staff has undergone very systematic training, which is rare in Guilin

The urban area of Guilin is not big, and the hotel is in the middle of several major attractions, so the traffic is very convenient. There are also Chunji Roast Goose and Lao Dongjiang Rice Noodles Headquarters nearby, don't miss it when you come to Guilin! !

The Elephant Trunk Mountain Scenic Spot is quite interesting, but the scenery is still mainly in Yangshuo. After staying for three days, let's go there~

The price of 2.499 is a single breakfast, and then an extra breakfast is 128. I just want to haha, it is completely at the level of 50 yuan.
3. Speaking of the price, the Sheraton Free Double Breakfast on the opposite side is only 540. The price of 499 is in Guilin City. Personally, I feel that it does not match at all.
4. The scenery is still good. It is close to the river, and the professional training facilities in the room are at the same level as Atour.
5. The most disgusting thing is the introduction of the hotel. It really insulted my IQ. It said it was a welcome fruit, but it turned out to be a self-service bar in the lobby. It was a table with some symbolic fruits on it. There are not many left, and the minibar is free to enjoy. My God, it's just that there are four bottles of drink cans in the refrigerator.
To sum up, this hotel is only about 300 grades, 499 is completely unmatched, tourists just have to be prepared!

I have to experience it myself to feel my excitement. The room is equipped with Foss mineral water, the toiletries are St. Paul's, electric curtains, a double bathtub...

Even if you don‚Äôt go out for a few days, you will not be bored at the hotel. There are gyms, sky swimming pools, afternoon tea in the courtyard of the Lijiang River, and a restaurant with a view on the 6th floor. By the way, I strongly recommend their Dinning room! I have eaten several meals, and I don't need to order takeout. The breakfast is included in the room rate, which is very distinctive and great.

Finally, I sincerely recommend everyone to choose this place! ! !

msg:If I go to Yangshuo, I can give a lot of hotel or homestay options that I have stayed in and recommended, but without exception, they all rely on the river; if you live in downtown Guilin and want to have a comparable river view, then try Lijiang Courtyard. You can walk to Fubo Mountain, Diecai Mountain and Qixing Park. The hotel I live in is very lucky. It has a large and invincible balcony to enjoy the river view. It's in place, the sister at the front desk speaks very softly, and also took the initiative to remind me that the car can be parked in the hotel's free parking lot. The most intimate thing in the room is the floor heating and electric toilet, the mattress and pillow are very comfortable, and the softness of the sheets is a plus. , the big bed of more than 2 meters is so comfortable that I completely forgot about breakfast. I really want to buy this bedding in this room. I regret that I didn't see the perfect sunrise, but I took pictures in the sun. All are blockbuster, next time you must come back to live here.

msg:After seeing a few similar stores, I finally decided to come here temporarily. It was the Lantern Festival. When we arrived at 7 o'clock in the evening, there was only Xiaoyu at the front desk. The housekeeper Xiaoyu contacted me when we were on the highway in the afternoon. We originally booked the 668 parent-child room, but when we arrived, we found that there was only one bed for 4 people who could not sleep well. I wanted to change to another twin room. To my surprise, Xiaoyu upgraded us to Jiangbian, and my daughter said she wanted to the night before. To eat glutinous rice balls, I asked Xiaoyu about it, and he gave us one, which was very considerate and detailed! Delivered things several times! The most important thing is that the room is very clean and it is very easy to use. The bathtub also has a disposable bag. The bathroom prompts are very good. There is also a place for babies to play on the 3rd floor. , it will not disturb other guests, and the little friends can play for another half an hour, which is also very good! And the son said that our parents were away for a while, and the sister wanted to go to the toilet because a certain elder sister helped, thank you very much! There are so many places to praise, it is a blessing for the hotel to have such staff! So I decided to extend the room for another night! The restaurant is also good. After dinner and breakfast, you must not miss it. You only know when you check in that it is a restaurant that many people check in. It's a worthwhile trip! It is much better than the experience of Chimelong three nights 5000! If you go in the future, you will stay there! Confess Shuaishuai Xiaoyu haha!

msg:For this hotel, I have too many surprises. It properly interprets the river view room and high-end service, making it a real home away from home. If I had to choose between a decent five-star hotel and poetry and a distant Lijiang yard, there is no doubt that I would choose Lijiang yard. Send out my real feelings about this stay, so that I can make a guide for future friends.
First, if you want to live in a river view room in the city center, this hotel is the first choice. It is located on the edge of the Li River. As soon as you open the curtains in the morning, you can see fishermen rowing bamboo rafts on the Li River, next to a business card in Guilin City "Pay. Boshan", Fubo's reflection, you can see this beautiful scenery in the room, wherever the camera goes, you can see the Lijiang River at a glance, and the mood is quite comfortable.
Second, the hotel restaurant is on the sixth floor, and the afternoon tea restaurant is on the first floor, without exception, by the Li River. The air conditioner is blowing in the room, chatting with two or three friends and drinking afternoon tea, and eating with the family, you can see the style of the Lijiang River outside the window, open a small bottle of red wine, full of happiness.
Third, the hotel's service is in place, and the humanized service is reflected in every detail. In the snack bar in the hotel lobby, there are not only snacks and tea that children like to eat, but also rubber bands, alcohol, hand cream, masks and other items that adults need, alcohol disinfection cotton pads in the elevator, and mineral springs on the mini bar after exiting the elevator. Water is free for guests to take back to their room to drink, which is a small detail that many hotels can't do. Every service staff is courteous and considerate when meeting guests, making people feel like spring breeze, warm their hearts, and feel at home.
Fourth, the facilities and equipment in the room are too surprising, ranging from electric curtains, smart toilets, hanging ironing machines, and small teacups and teapots, all of which reveal the word exquisite. The small tea table by the window sill near the river is not only an excellent spot for taking pictures of concave shapes. The luxurious bathtub in the room is comparable to a small swimming pool, and children are having fun in it.
Fifth, the overall decoration of the hotel is very unique, which is a realm that pure luxury cannot achieve. Personality, sophistication, elegance, and delicacy are very in line with my taste. There is a gym opposite our room and a children's playground downstairs. Fun for kids and adults alike. The hotel also has free parking, which is very convenient.
This time, due to time constraints, I did not go to experience all of them. Next time I come to Guilin, I will definitely choose this hotel. Friends who see it should thank me for Amway so much. The difficulty of choosing is here, and it no longer exists. This is definitely a hotel that I have never forgotten.

I like the layout and design of the room. The waiters are very friendly and attentive, and parking is easy. It is commendable that we were very lucky. In the evening, we watched a particularly beautiful sunset on the terrace of the hotel, and had a drink with friends in the evening wind. It was really not too pleasant. The sunset and evening wind and you, poetry and the distance are nothing more than this!

The breakfast is on the top floor, the view is very wide, and the beautiful mountains, rivers and cities of Guilin are all in view. It is rare to find such a quiet place in a busy city. The surrounding attractions are also very convenient, just a line on foot. It is very pleasant to take a walk with three or two friends. I have a very good impression of Xiaolan and Xiaoyanzi, the housekeepers in the hotel. There will be a chance to come again

msg:Guilin must punch hotel!
Recommended reason 1: The first-line river view, the room is huge!
This must be recommended! For someone like me who travels at will without planning the itinerary, such a hotel has met most of my expectations in Guilin. Just staying on the balcony of the room can bring in the beautiful scenery of the Lijiang River (than taking a cruise to see it) The Lijiang River has more flavor!), the design of the room is also my favorite style, some of which are Japanese-style, refreshing and comfortable! The heating in the room is awesome! The location of the hotel is very convenient, next to Fubo Mountain Park, and it takes ten minutes to walk to the city center!
Recommended reason 2: Food and wine
The restaurant of the hotel will have a large terrace. In the evening, you can also see the cruise ship that swims the night view of the Li River. The hotel's Guilin cuisine is also very authentic. I strongly recommend everyone to taste his white beer, Lijiang fish, and casserole hot pot!
Recommended Reason 3: Details
First of all, what moved me the most was the details in the elevator. The hotel will prepare anti-epidemic supplies and put them in the lobby and elevator for guests to use themselves. This intimate arrangement is very considerate!
The second detail that impressed me is that the hotel will have drinking water in the hallway. This is the first detail I have encountered in the hotel in many years of travel. Even if you can ask for more water from room service, it is not as good as This makes it more convenient to get it.
The third detail that makes me most reluctant is that the hotel's bathrobes are absolutely skin-friendly! So comfortable! This is the most comfortable bathrobe I've worn in a hotel I've worn for many years of travel! Because most bathrobes are made of that kind of lumpy material, so I don't touch them, including bathrobes from five-star hotels. It can be seen that Shihe Yuanfang is very attentive in customer experience!

msg:Let me put it this way, I have stayed in many large and small hotels. This hotel is one of the few hotels that my family members agree that they can give full marks and want to write a small essay to affirm it.

Let's talk about the location first. The hotel is located in the Xiangshan Scenic Area, close to the Li River, with a real river view. It is also very convenient to order takeout or something.

üçÉEnvironment: The decoration of the hotel lobby is simple and a**ospheric, and there is a tea room next to it, where you can sit and drink tea and coffee to enjoy the river view. The restaurant on the sixth floor has a rich breakfast, and Guilin rice noodles are absolutely üíØ. The room facilities are complete, and you can see at a glance that the price and thought are spent, touch switches, sensor trash cans, automatic TOTO toilets, constant temperature showers, textured toiletries, disposable bath bags, clean and reflective bathtubs, Free and unlimited self-collection of Nongfu Spring, as well as automatic curtains, etc., living in the room is a complete enjoyment. There are also children's playgrounds that children like very much, all of which are free and open.

üßπHygiene: There are no dead corners of hygiene, and all bathrooms are clean and reflective. üíØ

üîîService: üíØüíØüíØüíØüíØ, from the front desk to the restaurant to the room auntie, you can feel the warmth and friendliness of the hotel staff. We came by car, Yang Mei, Xiaotong and Miss Lan at the front desk helped us with our luggage, showed us the room, saw that we brought children and helped us upgrade the room, and gave the children exclusive toiletries. They were very patient. Makes people feel like spring breeze. There is also Liang Liang from the restaurant, who can remember what we liked to eat when we came to have breakfast the day before, and all the staff would greet us kindly when they saw us.

To sum up, next time I come to Guilin, I won't consider a second one, I think it's worth the money, and the overall experience is great! Share it with everyone, you will not be disappointed when you come.

msg:The second time I stayed in a hotel in Guilin, the experience was full. 1. Hotel scenery. The scenery of the hotel can be called a must, and it can kill many hotels in the city in seconds. Whether it is the hotel lobby, the restaurant on the top floor, the open-air swimming pool, or the room, the scenery is very beautiful. 2. Hotel decoration and facilities. The hotel's facilities are great, taking into account texture, beauty and convenience. The design style combines classical and modern, fashionable yet elegant, and clever use of blue and landscape elements makes the theme of "poetry and distance" distinct, without feeling flamboyant and exaggerated. A lot of details can be seen in its intentions. 3. Hotel services. When staying in a high-end hotel, service is an important indicator of hotel specifications. The service of Shi and Yuanfang Hotel is more personalized and humanized, responsive and responsive. Much better than the hotel I stayed in last time in Guilin. When we left, the lobby manager personally escorted us out, and when the taxi arrived, he also helped us open the door and assisted us to get on the bus. 4. The location of the hotel. It can be said that the location of this hotel is really good! Ten minutes to the East and West Alley, after dinner and a little wine, I walked back to the hotel. It was very comfortable to digest food without getting too tired. It is convenient and quick to go to many attractions from the hotel.

The reading lamp on the bedside is actually an a**osphere lamp, which is especially suitable for taking pictures. I took a lot of pictures with my sisters! There are also two bags of hanging ear coffee in the room, two bottles of Siyun mineral water, and 4 cans of free drinks in the refrigerator. There are also Luo Han Guo tea and Zhengshan Xiaochong tea on the small table on the balcony. The balcony is really great! ! Directly facing Fubo Mountain, I have never been so close to Fubo Mountain. Sitting on the balcony at night and looking at the scenery of the Li River, and the traffic on the opposite side is very a**ospheric, it is very suitable for sitting on the balcony in a daze. The bathrobe is fleece, and it is not cold at all to sit on the balcony in a bathrobe. The hotel's hair dryer is also very good, and the hair is not tangled. There is also a small iron in the room to organize clothes.
The breakfast buffet in the morning is also delicious and there are many varieties, such as Western-style bread, butter, jam, vegetable and fruit salad, Guilin-specific oil tea and marinated vegetable powder, especially marinated vegetable powder and matcha milk jelly. ! The little brothers and sisters at the front desk and the aunts in the restaurant are very gentle and have a very good stay experience. I will come again next time! !

üçÉEnvironment: The hall is very beautiful, and the overall design style of the room is relatively uniform. The preferred aqua blue and landscape paintings have the beauty of Chinese landscapes, but also abandon the dull Chinese tones, which are very suitable for Guilin landscapes.
üßπHygiene: The details are very well done, the bathtub countertop is very bright under the light, the sheets are very flat, and it is more comfortable to look at.
üîîService: The staff in the whole store are very enthusiastic and take the initiative to say hello.

Talk about a comprehensive feeling, full marks for small details. The soles of indoor disposable slippers also have anti-skid trea**ent, which is considered in place. Of course, there is no need to talk about the scenery. The large floor-to-ceiling windows directly see the scenery of Fubo Mountain on the Lijiang River outside. The large balcony is especially suitable for daze and tea. The whole hotel is built along the river, so the privacy on the balcony is also very good. In particular, there is no heating equipment in Guilin in winter. On the day of staying in the hotel, the outdoor temperature is close to freezing point, and it snows in some places. The air conditioner in the room is very powerful. It is set to 28 degrees and can actually reach 25 degrees without any problem. The shower is a constant temperature shower, and the temperature of the bath water can reach more than 40 degrees. It is especially recommended to know how comfortable it is to take a hot bath and wear single clothes in the room in the south. The only thing I'm not very satisfied with is the coffee for breakfast, which is not very good, which is very unfriendly to a coffee-heavy patient like me. Overall, recommended.

Before coming, I communicated with the staff repeatedly, and they gave advice patiently, professionally and carefully, so I chose this river view room with two transparent glass windows. When I entered the door, I exclaimed, such a transparent scenery. In order to match the transparency of the room, the shelves are all open and hollow. The view where the bathtub is located is the best, how comfortable it is to enjoy the view while soaking in the bath. You can already enjoy the scenery in the room, it doesn't matter if it's cold or not. For dinner in the hotel restaurant, the dishes are quite exquisite, not only beautiful, but also delicious. In the morning, go downstairs to drink a cup of hot Luo Han Guo tea, and then look at the river and mountains. You say this is not living in poetry? For the occasion of the Chinese New Year, the hotel also organized a number of activities, including dumplings, free food, and writing blessings. Fruit candy biscuits, mineral water and ginger syrup are always ready, and the staff butler is always on call, who can help adjust the TV and take pictures. If you are not afraid of the cold, you can go out for a walk. If you are afraid of the cold, you can have a good time in the hotel. If you want to come to Guilin, if you want to live comfortably and be close to the mountains and rivers, here and here, you have to choose this place.

If you are lucky, you can also see the beautiful scenery of the misty and rainy Li River.

The decoration of the store, the small tea sets and small accessories are all antique, which is very suitable for beauties who like antiquity to check in. On the first floor, you can also go down to the Li River at a close distance, drink a pot of tea by the river, and let yourself go.

The restaurant is on the 6th floor, and there is also a large platform upstairs, with an excellent view and a very pleasant night view. There is also an infinity pool on the roof. In summer, while drinking red wine, soaking in the pool, looking up at the stars, it is a good place for vacation.

The food in the store is also very characteristic of Guilin. There is a refreshing soup for breakfast. You must try it. The food of each place represents the culture of a place.

msg:A great stay experience! As soon as I entered the door, I was greeted by a warm little sister Yanzi. After checking in, she warmly introduced me to the various functional areas of the hotel, which made me familiar with the hotel for the first time and really felt at home.
    
üöó Transportation: The hotel is at the back door of Wangcheng Scenic Area. It is only a few stops from Guilin Station by bus to the hotel. Of course, it is more convenient to drive by yourself.

üçÉEnvironment: The hotel is located between Fubo Mountain Scenic Spot and Diecai Mountain Scenic Spot. It is very quiet and suitable for vacation. Downstairs, there is a barbecue that the locals love to eat. You can also walk for 10 minutes to the streets and alleys near the Wangcheng Scenic Area. There are Internet celebrity shops, and there are also old food shops, such as ice and snow. The room is spacious and there is a swimming pool on the top floor. Unfortunately, the weather is too cold. Come and experience it next summer, while watching the river view and swimming again.

üîîService: Entering the room, every step has exquisite details, nightgowns, toiletries, coffee bags, disposable bath bags, etc. Most of the electrical appliances in the room are smart home, and the experience is great! Tea leaves are prepared on the tatami, and the most detailed is the Luo Han Guo, which is a local feature of Guilin. Just after eating the barbecue, go upstairs and drink a cup of Luo Han Guo to reduce the possibility of getting angry. The hotel also prepares other teas for travelers who are not used to drinking Luo Han Guo.
The buffet breakfast is very rich, fruit information, Guilin rice noodles and oil tea are also very Guilin characteristics.

üßπHygiene: The room is very clean, the toiletries are also very characteristic of the hotel, and the fragrance is very pleasant.

In terms of geographical location, the distance from Fubo Mountain, Yushan Park, Dongxixiang and other scenic spots is about 2 kilometers, which is very suitable for tourists who come to Guilin to live. As soon as you enter the room, you can see the beautiful scenery outside the huge floor-to-ceiling windows. You can sit on the tatami and drink tea. There are old people fishing on the river, which is refreshing... The rooms are all smart homes, touch screen to control lights and curtains, and the hotel also prepares I ordered ear-hanging coffee, and the tea cups are very delicate. I feel the design concept of the hotel manager, "I hope that all guests can experience the feeling of home". The most intimate thing is the anti-collision sticker on the corner of the table, which prevents children from knocking Bump and bump, to achieve the ultimate sense of security. There is a restaurant on the 6th floor of the hotel, where you can eat during the day and have a drink with friends at night. There is an open-air swimming pool on the top floor. You can experience the romance of the infinity pool when staying in summer.
Although the price is on the high side, but overall it is still very worth living! By the way, the milk cereal for breakfast in the hotel is super delicious hahaha

Even as a Guilin native, I want to experience the beauty of Guilin's landscape in my spare time. There is a mid-to-high-end hotel by the Lijiang River in Elephant Trunk Hill, Poetry and the Distance Lijiang Courtyard. It is adjacent to the Elephant Trunk Hill Park and lives by the water of the Li River. The elegant and scholarly decoration style makes the inhabitants feel at ease.

The hotel is not big, but it can meet the daily needs and spiritual needs of travelers.
The first floor is the check-in hall (check-in), the riverside afternoon tea restaurant, and the reception area.
Floors 2-5 are all guest room areas. In addition, there are children's personal areas, spa, and multi-functional meeting rooms to meet the needs of various groups of people.
The 6th floor is the sky restaurant. Guests can enjoy buffet breakfast (including Guilin rice noodles, Western breakfast, oil tea, etc., with a wide variety of varieties), as well as lunch and dinner parties, dinners with friends, and special festivals. It is also a good choice. casual bar
The 7th floor is an open-air swimming pool. You can enjoy the beautiful scenery of the Li River while swimming, and then add a glass of cocktails~The beautiful night time begins like this~

The room types in the hotel are basically river view. I stayed in a 180-degree balcony river view room. The room is equipped with a large balcony, overlooking the Li River and looking at the Elephant Trunk Hill from the side. The scenery is excellent!
The room is equipped with a bathtub (disposable bath bag), hair dryer, toiletries, water, refrigerator drinks, etc., to meet all the daily needs of travel accommodation, how comfortable it is to take a bath in the room to relax when tired.

There are many treasure hotels along the Li River, but this one is my favorite one. If you come to Guilin for "cultivation", I hope it will be favored by you.

For example, the mineral water used for drinking is the Voss brand, and the drinks in the minibar are also free to enjoy. Mineral water can be collected for free in the elevator on the floor, and there are also free masks and some snacks and fruits in the lobby. Breakfast is on the sixth floor, the view is very good.

The sanitation in the room is also good, the only drawback is that it is best to choose a room with a view of the Lijiang River, because the room by the road is a bit noisy.

Let me describe it in words: it is very spacious and clean, and some details of the room are well designed. It is a pity that the Li River was not very beautiful that day, and the middle of the road section seemed to be renovated.

[Location]: The hotel is in the center of Guilin, next to the scenic spot Fubo Mountain, you can see it when you have breakfast in the morning, and it only takes ten minutes to go to Jingjiang Wangcheng and Dongxixiang;
[Room environment]: The room is very clean, the cleaning aunt may be a little obsessive, and everything is neat and tidy; the hotel is newly opened in 21 years, and everything inside is very new. Let me complain here. The hotel has projection, but you can only watch satellite TV, not smart, and you can't cast the screen. It's a bit of a waste.
[Services]: The lady at the front desk is very patient, and the housekeeper Xiaoyanzi is highly praised here; the hotel provides an airport or high-speed rail transfer, and the little brother's attitude is also very good; at the same time, there is a free fishing experience, because we did not test it in the winter Yes; the sugar-free mints at the front desk are delicious, you have to grab a few before going out. There is a laundry room on the 3rd floor, so you don't have to worry about clothes if you come for many days

All in all, this time is a very good experience, and I will choose this store when I come to Guilin in autumn.

msg:This is not the first time I have come to Guilin. I have stayed in many other high-end hotels in Guilin before, but I have never stayed in Poetry and Far. This time I transferred from another hotel with the mentality of giving it a try. Not disappointed, but also full of surprises.
First of all, after entering the hotel, I feel a breath of literature and art, and the fragrance of the hotel is also very natural. In short, after entering the hotel, it makes people feel relaxed. There is also a large living room next to the hotel lobby. The windows are designed with floor-to-ceiling windows. The Lijiang River and Elephant Trunk Hill can be seen out.
Perhaps because of the off-season, Xiao Ning at the front desk was very enthusiastic to help us upgrade the big bed room to a river-view tatami bed room.
After entering my room, I can't wait to return to the front desk to give Xiao Ning a hug, because this room is really great. On the tatami, there is an antique tea table and tea set. As soon as the curtains are opened, you can enjoy the beautiful scenery of the Li River while enjoying the tea, which is more relaxing. The facilities in the room are also very good, there are heated toilets and automatic trash bins, latex mattresses make people sleep very comfortable, and the fragrance of shower gel and shampoo feels very advanced.
There is a children‚Äôs playground on the third floor of the hotel, and a gym on the fourth floor. I looked at the facilities inside and felt that my child would not get tired of playing in it for an afternoon. There is also a leaky infinity pool on the top floor, and the water quality is still acceptable. There is also a self-service laundry room on the third floor, which is perfect for people like me who don't bring much clothes to go out. You can wear it the next day after washing and drying.
The next morning, I went to the hotel restaurant to experience breakfast, because I don‚Äôt like to eat breakfast in the hotel, because I always feel that the hotel‚Äôs breakfast can‚Äôt make the local cuisine. Sure enough, the high-end hotels are no exception. The quality of the breakfast is not bad, and the taste of Guilin rice noodles is barely enough, but I feel that the types of breakfast are less and the selection is not good. But why should I come to experience breakfast? Because the hotel‚Äôs breakfast room is on the top floor, there are two parts, indoor and open-air, but no matter where you sit, there is unlimited scenery in front of you. Imagine you are facing the morning sun and enjoying breakfast facing the Li River and Elephant Trunk Hill. What else cannot be forgiven.
Because I need to use the computer temporarily, I went to the front desk and asked if the hotel does not have a business center, but the front desk enthusiastically lent me a laptop for me to work in the room.
When I left the store, the hotel asked me about my next itinerary and gave me a few disposable masks. I feel that the hotel has a good control over the details.
All in all, this is a very satisfying experience. Whether it is the hotel's internal facilities, surrounding environment, and staff services, it can be regarded as the ceiling of Guilin Hotel. The only flaw is the breakfast, I hope the hotel can make a little improvement, add some types, make the flavors richer, and have more choices

On the way, I also sent some water and small snacks for us to eat on the road. It was so considerate. It really felt like spending a few hundred yuan to live for tens of thousands of yuan. Next time I come here, I have to stay a few more days.

It is zero distance from the Lijiang River, and Fubo Mountain is next to it. It is estimated that the locals almost got it wrong, thinking that Fubo Mountain is Elephant Trunk Mountain. Lying in the yard on the first floor, watching the blue sky and white clouds, watching fishermen fishing by the riverbank, there is a feeling of isolation from the world. The hotel service is good, and also sent me afternoon tea. Although I don't like to eat pastries very much. But thank you too. I feel very warm. A moon on the roof of the hotel is more suitable for taking pictures. This surprise made me feel that the Mid-Autumn Festival has come early.

The guests staying here are also quite friendly. The hotel provides free fishing tools for the residents to fish. If you go upstairs to eat in the evening, those who catch fish will be processed in the restaurant. They are just curious and take a few more glances at other people‚Äôs houses. Of fish, you can invite to eat fish together, learn more skills, don‚Äôt hold yourself down

The bathtub is also very comfortable, there is no bubble ball, and I ordered the takeaway bath ball temporarily, which is also very convenient
There is also a swimming pool on the top floor, I personally like silence, suitable for swimming in the morning, can avoid the crowd
The next time I come to Guilin, it is as simple as staying in the Lijiang courtyard again, just like taking the high-speed train to Guangzhou, just as simple as just going to have a morning tea, you have to feel the beauty again and again! ! !

msg:Quarreling with my boyfriend, so annoying, I am annoyed when I see him, and I drove to Guilin from Changsha to relax with my girlfriend
More than 500 kilometers, I set off early in the morning. I was afraid of the sun. I drove slowly for 7.8 hours. I was tired.
The hotel is recommended by Xiaohongshu. Follow the navigation to the hotel. It is located in the center of the city. I thought it was inconvenient to park. Go in on the right side of the hotel. There is a large parking lot. You can park as you wish.
It‚Äôs stupid that you unload the door of the hotel without first unloading your luggage. Two fools.
When we entered the hotel, someone helped us to drag it.. After we checked in, the little brother of the hotel helped us put the luggage into the room again, the service was great, right?
It‚Äôs a bit of a pity to enter the room. I made a conscious decision. The hotel business is good. There is no room with river view anymore... A room without river view is not enough to relax
I really like the design of the high and low floors of the room. When I reach the room, I rush to the bed barefoot. The mattress is so soft, it is more comfortable than my own home. The exhaustion of driving is quickly dispersed, and the duck neck is delicious in the car. It‚Äôs salty. The water in the hotel is voss. I like this thick bottle. The plastic slippers are also comfortable like **** shoes. I really want to ask for a purchase link at the front desk.
I have an allergic scalp, but if I almost wash my scalp with hotel supplies, my scalp becomes inflamed immediately. The wash and care in this shop are also very comfortable, my hair is not frizzy, and the details are well done.
The hotel‚Äôs breakfast is on the sixth floor. I see a few foreigners who have a bowl of rice noodles. I especially recommend this Guilin rice noodles. It‚Äôs really a blessing to eat
Guilin‚Äôs rice noodles are so delicious that they are worth visiting for a bowl of rice noodles.
The next morning, I went downstairs and went around, only to find that the Lijiang River was beside the lobby, and there were people fishing below. Unfortunately, there was no afternoon tea or else I didn‚Äôt want to go out for wandering. People were walking in the middle of the painting, and Fubo Mountain was on the right. , On the left is Diecai Mountain. It‚Äôs so close. Standing by the window, I saw someone swimming in the Lijiang River. There is a breeze and I don‚Äôt know which direction it is coming from. The summer in Guilin is not as comfortable as summer.
The most funny thing is that after a while, a group of people gathered around a man holding a big fish, joking and happily saying that they were going to the restaurant on the sixth floor to have a meal. The fish was too fat, saying that it weighed eight kilograms, and the Lijiang River was How nourishing it is, it‚Äôs only envious. The hotel provides fishing rods and ports for free, and we don‚Äôt know how to fish.
The best thing is the terrace on the sixth floor..‚Ä¶
I‚Äôm going to night. I‚Äôve seen a lot. The natural gentle natural wind has cured my air-conditioning disease. I have never seen such a big and clear moon on August 15th. It‚Äôs an early holiday. My friends from Changsha also send the moon in the group at the same time. I posted a picture of the big moon taken on the terrace of the hotel and they were envious. At this moment, a group of friends should be on the terrace of the top floor. Music, beer, barbecue, fish, and the world are worth it.
By the way, there is a swimming pool on the top floor, so you have to prepare your swimsuit in advance next time
There is also a self-service laundry and a dryer on the third floor. I will not wash this. Let the family with children look at the countertop outside the laundry room and take a bottle of free water to drink out.
The children‚Äôs play area is also on the third floor. I am a cruel person who doesn‚Äôt like children. Seeing children walking around, the hotel is really human and loving.

Oh, the people of Guilin are so happy, there is such a beautiful hotel, and I really feel happy to live in such a hotel.
Next time I come, I must live in a river view room, I feel much better, and it‚Äôs a bit pleasing to everyone.

Although he did not get the result he wanted, I believe it must be a day that he will never forget! Thanksgiving poems and the distance, the rest area on the first floor is very tuned, there are free fruit coffee and tea, the restaurant on the 6th floor has a beautiful environment, and the infinity pool on the top floor is not experienced because I don‚Äôt want to go into the water, but the sound of the high sound playing on it should be very good. Beautiful, the surrounding environment has everything to eat, drink and play. A hotel worth checking out. Guilin boutique tourism is the first choice!

It is worth mentioning that the Hundred Days Banquet is held on the 6th floor of the hotel, with a large outdoor terrace, excellent views and landscape views.

msg:Because the flight was cancelled, I stayed in Guilin for one more night, so I booked this hotel~ When we checked in, the front desk also helped us upgrade the room. I have to say that this room has a really good view! There is a big floor-to-ceiling window in the room, and an oversized bathtub! Loved love! The hotel facilities are pretty good, there is a children's playground opposite the room, I feel like we are chartered hahaha! The breakfast at the hotel is also pretty good, there is porridge and rice noodles to satisfy! There is free airport drop-off the next day~ The overall service is still very satisfactory. There are two shortcomings. The first is that some details of the hotel can be improved, and the second is that a cleaning aunt suddenly swipes her card into the room when she goes to bed in the morning...said Did we call for service? Then I found out that I had made a mistake and left, a bit inexplicable. Apart from these two points, this hotel is still highly recommended~

There are no dead spots in the room, and there is no bug in the mirror. Close to the Li River, the river view is invincible, much better than the two rivers and four lakes, it is very quiet, and you can see morning swimmers in the morning. There are not many varieties of breakfast, but the quality is high. The rice noodles cooked by the aunt in the restaurant are so delicious. The restaurant is on the sixth floor. I really want to go to the outdoor terrace for breakfast, but it‚Äôs too sunny. It is recommended to lay down the umbrellas, otherwise the utilization rate is very low. Special thanks to Xiaoyu, Xiaoqiu, and Xiaoyanzi for their thoughtful service, answering all questions and asking for help, and helping to arrange airport pick-up and send luggage. . So friendly

There is no porter and porter to help with luggage! When we arrived at the front desk to check in, a girl originally received us, but half of it was handed over to a male waiter! As a result, the man took our ID card and scanned it for us, then stood ignoring us! I said why don't you do it for me? As a result, people directly blamed me for saying why you didn't make it clear? ! How can I make it clear? The two of you haven't handed over well, and you have to blame the distinguished guests for letting the customers hang out! I have never been treated like this! At this moment, my intestines are all regretful! Shangri-La should not be returned! Just because of this unpleasant experience, this man deliberately arranged for us to be on the lowest floor near the road and facing a night snack shop! In the evening, I was so disturbed by the noise of the cars on the road and the noise of supper that I couldn't sleep! Also super not soundproof! The sound of bathing upstairs, the sound of walking outside the door! That's it! Never stayed in such a bad hotel! Only the hotel lobby is well decorated! The rest is really a three star hotel!
