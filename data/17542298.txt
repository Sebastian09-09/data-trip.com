The hotel has its own shuttle bus that takes you to 'downtown' which is actually just a 10 min walk. I wish the American style breakfast was better. The baked goods didn't taste fresh unfortunately. Overall, we had an amazing time away from the city! Highly recommend.

Environment: Nothing to say, quiet and beautiful. There is a stream outside the window, and the children also saw tadpoles. There are some facilities for children to play.

Service: Very considerate, Wang Ying at the front desk helped us deliver the luggage to the room, saving a lot of time. The service is also very enthusiastic and thoughtful.

Room 212, where we stayed, is said to be the best room in the ordinary superior room. It is really good, facing south, with a playground for children outside the balcony, and a good view. The room is quite large, with double bathrooms and a bathtub, but the tatami is a bit hard to sleep on. The sliding door of the bathroom is a bit old and not easy to use.
The skin care products are not the legendary L'Occitane, but pmpm, but at the price of 699 set meal, what else do you want? !
There are welcome fruits, afternoon tea cookies, and direct drinking and capsule coffee machines in the room, which are good.
Environment: The environment is very pleasant, not crowded, full of green, and many places are preparing for greening, which should be more comfortable in summer. It is especially suitable for children and people who are not obsessed with the ancient town itself. It is much more comfortable here than staying in a B&B in the suburbs of Beijing.
Service: Luggage check-in, shuttle bus, and breakfast service are all good. A hotel worth recommending

The tatami mats requested were also ready, and there were fruit cookies for check-in. The room was large and the environment was very good. There was a stream next to it. It was full of green and fresh air. It would be even better if it didn't rain~~
Although it was not as convenient as the shuttle bus of another scenic hotel, you needed to go to the Lan Valley Service Station and then change cars to the hotel (you can go directly to the downstairs of the room), but you can call and come at any time. There were also many cars when you came back, so you didn't have to wait. I heard that more than 20 celebrities stayed here this time, and the privacy was excellent.
Although there were not many breakfasts, there were few people, and you could eat outdoors by the stream. It was also very delicate and the service was also very good, but it was a bit difficult to keep up when there were many people behind.
In general, it is suitable for Xiaobao to play. There are some amusement facilities on the grass, and there are small fish in the small river next to it. It is a good experience and I will go again~

The room of Hangu Villa Hotel should be the most comfortable in Gubei Water Town, with a wide view, bright room, complete configuration, bathtub, balcony and tatami, which the children like very much.
The service attitude of the staff is also very good. We live in Building 8, where we can see the Great Wall. It is a bit far from the restaurant, but there is an electric car, so it is not a big problem. It is also very pleasant to walk along the plank road by the river. There are not many mosquitoes, which I did not expect.
This is the fourth time I have come to Gubei Water Town. I have stayed in Yushe, Wuzhenhui and Wangjinglou before. Hangu Villa should have the largest room and can accommodate three people.

The hotel restaurant can deliver meals to the room, which is very convenient (a small delivery fee will be charged). The taste is also very good. The front desk guy also helped to deliver medicine.

There is air leakage from one side of the tatami, so I felt like wearing a cotton-padded jacket when I slept at night... The room was relatively warm. But please note that no one can sleep on the tatami, so the price/performance ratio is not as high as that of an inn! Gubei Water Town started to have heating after November 10th, and the inn started to have heating. It is still worth it to stay in an inn.

The facilities in the room are also very complete, and the hot springs and drone performances in the scenic area are great😄

The scenic spot is under unified management. Since Hangu is far away from the ancient town, we have to take several shuttle buses. At 4.7pm, the dispatcher at the Gubei Light gate was lazy and a naughty boy named Huang had a very bad attitude towards passengers. It is said that the scenic spot originally hoped to provide better services to guests, but the training cannot keep up, and there is a huge gap in the professional attitude and ability of the personnel. There are many employees who are just dawdling, and no one works except for the manager. Anyone who comes to experience it will know.

msg:1. Check-in: Accommodation vehicles need to be parked in parking lot 1, and 4 shuttle buses need to be transferred to get to the check-in building. On the first day of Qingming Festival, it took a total of one hour to queue from the parking lot to the hotel entrance. It was very frustrating. The first bus queue waited for half an hour. More than a hundred people lined up. The shuttle bus can only carry about 10 people at a time. If there is any There is less luggage and less people to carry, and the frequency does not reach 2/3 minutes. The accommodation is mixed with Japanese tourists. There is no exclusive shuttle bus for hotel guests. Large luggage can be checked into the hotel room (it took almost 2 hours). Small luggage can only be carried by yourself. There are a lot of big and small bags. It is very Embarrassing, with a child in tow. When we arrived at the scenic spot, we queued up again to check in, which took about 10-15 minutes. Then we continued to queue for the scenic spot shuttle bus and waited for another 10-15 minutes. In the middle, we walked over a bridge with large and small bags, arrived at the transfer station again to wait for the shuttle bus, and finally arrived at the hotel lobby, which took a full hour. Very bad experience.
2. Room and environment: Very good. There is a small river flowing through it, which is quiet in the bustle. There will probably be more mosquitoes in summer. In early spring, mosquitoes have already flown in groups.
3. Breakfast: Western foods are all warm and cold, including fried potatoes, sausages, etc., especially fried potatoes, which are cold. Almost every Chinese dish has chili and curry. The ones without chili are scrambled eggs with tomatoes. After staying for two days, the breakfast items are the same every day.
Check-in itinerary:
Journey 1: Parking Lot-Scenic Spot Entrance;
Journey 2: Entrance to the scenic spot - transfer station 1;
Journey 3: Walk for 1 minute to transfer station 2;
Journey 4: Transfer station 2 - hotel entrance;
Journey 5: After checking in, take the shuttle bus to the accommodation building (5 minutes walk, you need to take the shuttle bus to drag your luggage)

From the shuttle bus service to the check-in arrangements are very good. Check in from the service center, take the shuttle bus to Shanshui City, walk 200 meters after getting off the bus, arrive at the Hangu Interchange Station, and take the bus to the hotel. The front desk staff will explain all the facilities and experience items, and the concierge staff will deliver them to the room throughout the process.
Recommend an itinerary:
first day...
Arrive at noon, eat handmade dumplings at Yuanbao Pavilion near Hangu Interchange Station or Cantonese-style refreshments at Jingyue Building, then transfer to the hotel for check-in.
After a short rest, you can choose the optional forest camping refreshments in the package during the hottest time in the afternoon, and relax in the cool underground here, where the temperature is 3-5°C lower than that of Beijing urban area, and leisurely recuperate the tiredness of driving from the urban area for two hours.
Two hours after afternoon tea, you can come to the open-air swimming pool. The temperature is right at this time, and the water temperature of the swimming pool is more comfortable after a day of direct sunlight.
In the evening, walk from Hangu Station to the snack street or a restaurant such as a barbecue restaurant closer to the Great Wall. Take the night tour cable car at 8 o'clock. When you arrive at the Great Wall, the drone show at Riyue Island Square begins. You can watch the drone show from a VIP perspective on the Great Wall.
After the night tour, go directly to the Duan Family Courtyard or Yushe next to the entrance of the Great Wall to have an open-air hot spring before going to bed. After the end, take a shuttle bus to Wangjing Street to return quickly.
the next day…
In the morning, you can continue to play in the swimming pool after breakfast.
After check-out and check-in luggage to the parking lot, at noon and afternoon, enjoy lunch and coffee in the ancient town relaxedly, wait for the sun to weaken after three o'clock, and then play in the ancient town. There are many projects and many choices, and you can play until the evening before leaving.

If you don’t want to visit the Great Wall like a special soldier, Gubei Water Town is worth Amway for two days and one night.

The disadvantage is that the location is relatively remote, and you need to call a shuttle bus in advance.
There is no indoor swimming pool, and it is impossible to enter the water during the day in summer.
The tatami is facing the air outlet, and people who sleep there are prone to catch cold.
The variety of breakfast is relatively small, but the taste is ok.
The advantage is that it is very quiet, the room is large and the design is beautiful.

msg:It was the first time to help the old and the young to come to Hangu, and I chose a quiet hotel. The old man was very satisfied, and the child couldn't speak but looked very happy. I am very grateful to Manager Zhang Jian for his considerate service, which has brought our travel experience to a new level. Hangu’s room type can accommodate 3 adults and you can also bring a child. It is especially suitable for family travel. When the men at home are free, they are ready to come and play again. highly recommended

msg:Environment: I brought my parents to live here, and my parents liked the decoration of the hotel very much. The hotel is relatively quiet and the design blends in with the surroundings.
It is necessary to change the shuttle bus three times to get in and out. In fact, each section is not long. It would be nice if it could be more convenient.
Facilities: all are good. When I checked in, I found that one of the curtains was out of power. I changed the battery in time, and it didn't affect anything.
Service: very good. I originally thought that this kind of hotel service would be a little bit behind, but everyone from the front desk to the eldest sister on the management floor to the maintenance master and the master who drove the shuttle bus was very enthusiastic.
Breakfast: The reviews from others are not very good, but it may be improved now. It’s almost nine o’clock, and it’s still hot.

First of all, the hotel needs to transfer cars, but you can call a car at any time, and it is not troublesome to bring a one-year-old baby. Our little treasure likes to be a sightseeing car. There is an open swimming pool on the second floor of the hotel lobby, which is relatively sunny, and there is a restaurant, but the restaurant is suitable for small children, and there is no fried rice. Tell us to make noodles for us. Clear soup noodles are 58... let's make egg fried rice, also 58, this Bad reviews. But you can go to Hubei Zhiguang Hotel for free swimming. We felt good after swimming for a day, and it included three free tickets. In general, 3000 a night (mainly expensive for the Dragon Boat Festival), can play for two days, so many people can still do it Yes, the environment is really good, the room is big, and the film is released. If you can come here on weekdays, it must be worth it, so five stars

The room can accommodate three people, and the layout is reasonable. The child sleeps on tatami mats, which are a little hard. The mattress can be thicker. The big pillow is too soft, and the elderly have not had a good rest. It is recommended to ask about the pillow arrangements according to the situation of the guests. The air conditioner is quiet but cools well. You can book a car when you come in and out of the hotel, which is very convenient. Thanks to the many lads who picked us up. It was afternoon when we left the scenic area, and the weather was hot. Thanks to the driver Wang Long who took us directly from Shanshui City to the No. 1 parking lot. He was warm and friendly and made the family feel very happy. Special thanks!

Disadvantages: 5-star room rate, poor texture of slippers, uncomfortable, it is the first time to give a relatively poor room of the same level when there are a lot of vacant rooms, there is obviously a bad smell in the bathroom as soon as you enter the door, and you will change it only after you ask questions I bought a room with the same price and a better location. It is recommended to equip professional thicker tatami mattresses. The current ones are very thin and very uncomfortable! Many hot foods for breakfast, such as fried eggs, are prepared a long time in advance, and they are all cold!

Check-in You need to transfer before checking out and taking the shuttle bus, and you need to walk on a stone road for about 5 minutes in the middle. It is extremely unfriendly to the elderly, children and people carrying luggage. Moreover, transferring to the shuttle bus in summer is a kind of torture. Not only the two shuttle buses are You have to wait and walk under the scorching sun. 2. Several buildings are independent. If you live far away, you need to walk a long distance for breakfast or swimming. 3. The balcony door was broken when you checked in... resulting in a lot of mosquitoes in the house. 4 .The quality of the service staff varies... half of them enter the room directly without wearing shoe covers (the room layout has a shoe rack at the door, theoretically everyone inside is barefoot or wearing slippers) 5. The air conditioner above the tatami blows directly onto the bed...it is on The air conditioner cannot sleep. 6. The restaurant's dinner menu has shrunk even more than during the epidemic... The impression of hot dishes is no more than ten. 7. The only niche hotel in the same price range that does not have hot spring water in the room. 8. There is even a charge for the minibar.

The room is clean and tidy, spacious and bright. It also has a large balcony where we can stand outside and enjoy the scenery. We are all very satisfied. It was cold at night.

msg:Teammate evaluation: value for money! Let’s not talk about the cliché, compare the various hotels I have stayed in, and talk about the details of the experience:
Although the hotel is not very new, the facilities are well maintained, and the cleaning is also meticulous. Although the furnishings are simple, the details are very attentive; unlike some hotels, looking at the magnificent rooms, you can only stop looking at the details! - I'm the one who sees the gaps first when I arrive in a room
In this way, the hotel in the valley has been carefully checked, and there are no mosquitoes and mosquito bodies; the corners and crevices are also cleaned very cleanly;
The temperature in Miyun is still a few degrees lower than that in the city, and the leaves have almost fallen off. With such a large floor-to-ceiling window surrounded by glass, the hotel's thermal insulation, heating and sound insulation are all well done!
The room is very big, sleeping three or five people is not a silly problem, especially for families with children, the tatami and the bedroom can be separated, the light and sound insulation are good, each area of the large room can independently control the lighting in the room, there are also sockets and sockets on the tatami. switch

Environment: Quiet in the middle of the hustle and bustle, and we don't feel inconvenience for people like us who are okay with legs and feet; the car is parked in the parking lot of the Water Town Hotel, and the luggage is directly checked here to Hangu, and then checked back from Hangu! People just walk around the ancient town and have lunch before going to Hangu. You can also take the shuttle bus at Langu Station. It’s not too far to stroll in the past. Noisy; when the weather is good with your baby, you can set up tents in a specific area of the hotel park, and you can take advantage of all kinds of food, drink and entertainment in the ancient town.

Service: very meticulous and thoughtful, if you have time to participate in singing bowl healing is also good

The separation of movement and stillness is in place but there is also a proper transition, which greatly weakens the sense of presence of the TV and makes people focus on vacation and interaction. The transportation is actually very convenient, and it is just a bowl of soup away from the business of the water town. Although there are not many choices, the price of the minibar in the room is too conscientious! When the spring is warm and the flowers are blooming, I will definitely come again!

Environment: The overall Japanese style of the room, parents like it very much, and it is also very suitable for a family of three to travel. The environment of the hotel is also good. It is already early winter, and the surrounding scenery is relatively bald. It should be beautiful in summer.

Service: Very considerate. Although Hangu is divided into buildings, the response speed is very fast. The charging cable is sent and the shuttle bus is connected to a certain place very quickly. It will arrive within a few minutes. Every time I get on and off the bus, the front desk greets me warmly and sends it to the room for the first time. Especially Liang Chunfeng, Ye Tianyue, and Zhang Jian served very well.

Breakfast: Breakfast is served at one time, divided into Chinese style and Western style. My parents are very satisfied with the Chinese style, which is well matched and thinks it is better than the buffet style.

Parents participated in the singing bowl experience, but it was just a nap.

msg:I'm quite lazy and don't like this kind of reviews, but Hangu gave me a very big surprise. It's really the first hotel that made me want to come up and give a five-star review. I traveled on the first day of November. In order to avoid traffic jams, I went out early, and I was prepared that all levels would drop during the big holiday. However, when I went through the formalities in Gubei Water Town, I was very surprised. It was only ten o'clock. I just told me that I could check in, but I thought I heard it wrong at first. After all, I have experienced many times when I couldn’t check in at three or four o’clock. Being able to enter the hotel after ten o’clock really made me like an old man and a host. The child's "main force" was really pleasantly surprised. When he entered the hotel, whether it was the lobby, the shuttle bus, or the cleaning service staff, they were all very enthusiastic and thoughtful. I was lucky, and the cleaning told us that the first day on the 1st was hot air, and the clothes were thick, haha~~ and the small dessert I saw when I returned to the hotel in the evening~ The taste is not bad~ I would like to thank you for calling Liang Chunfeng's staff has been helping us contact the luggage delivery vehicle. When we finally left, he saw that we had a lot of things, and he helped to carry them all the time. He also said that if the things are sinking, you should take a little while, which is really warm.

Our family took the shuttle bus from the No. 1 parking lot to the visitor center. Drag the box into the visitor center for check-in, then take the shuttle bus to Shanshuicheng Station, drag the box across the scenic spot, take the hotel shuttle bus to the lobby to get the room card, and then take the shuttle bus to the room in Building 7, it’s really too much tossing , if you can go directly from the parking lot to the hotel lobby

msg:After a year, I brought my baby to Gubei Water Town for the second time and chose Hangu Villa Hotel. Three days and two nights, a very satisfying and comfortable vacation experience.
In the late summer and early autumn, the forests are all dyed, the creeks are flowing, and the birds are roaring.

Hangu Villa is located in the Langu area, with 1 to 9 buildings (there seems to be no 4 buildings) built on the mountain. Each building has three floors, and each floor has three guest rooms. There are more than 70 rooms in total, and the room types are all suites of more than 70 square meters. The layout is generally the same (the previous video). The difference between the advanced suite < deluxe < landscape is the floor.
There is a bathtub, a stereo, and a capsule coffee machine. Spare is L'Occitane.

We chose the deluxe suite. The deluxe suite is on the 2nd and some 3rd floors. This balcony faces the south, facing the hill, with floor-to-ceiling windows on three sides.
.
2. The fee includes 3 adults, if the 4 adults are fully occupied, you can add a set of tatami bedding, breakfast, swimming and hot spring tickets if you make up the service fee at the service center.
The tatami in the room can sleep two adults, and the children are particularly novel and like it.

Hot springs and swimming can be reserved on the applet, and hot springs can be selected in Shangcheng (this year, it has been found that the layout has been changed, and the female guest area is much smaller), Yuda and Duanjia.
Swimming In addition to Hangu's own open-air swimming pool, you can also go to Gubeizhiguang (with heating).
.
3. Meals: Breakfast is 80-85 points, the variety is acceptable, and there are basic categories. It is a little less than the light of the ancient north, but after all, the tenants are much less than the light of the north.
Enjoy a cozy brunch outdoors in late summer and early fall.
The restaurant can provide lunch and dinner, but there are not many diners, and there are not many meals that can be ordered, which is slightly expensive.
In the room, a fruit is delivered every morning, and a dessert is delivered in the evening, and the types will be changed.
.
Fourth, the service is very good, the waiters and front desk staff we encountered were very nice. Courteous, thoughtful and warm. The response is relatively timely.
Thumbs up for the management-like staff at the front desk wearing glasses. There is also the waiter who delivered the dessert. The child went out to play and ran into the dining car on the first floor. Although it was not our turn, the lady took the initiative to give the child a small cake in our room in advance.
.
5. The hotel is equipped with an open-air swimming pool and an outdoor children's playground. You can see the drone at the door, and you can walk up the slope for ten minutes to the church and cafe on the top of the mountain.
.
Sixth, the fly in the oin**ent is the inconvenience problem mentioned by many customers.
The shuttle bus from Hangu Hotel can only be sent to the service station at the foot of the mountain. If you go to the water town shuttle bus, you need to cross a bridge and go up a slope to Shanshuicheng Station. If the child does not want to walk and has to be carried, or has a lot of luggage, plus the stone road, I have to say that it is a bit troublesome. (Hint: Luggage can be checked directly from the parking lot to the hotel, or from the hotel to the parking lot)
It is recommended that the water town or hotel find a way to solve this "pain point".

The floor of the bathroom and the shower cubicle are covered with mold. I don't know if it's just our room or both. We spent most of the time out shopping, went to the hot springs at night and didn't take a shower in the hotel. We fell asleep when we came back and didn't even think about complaining. I don’t know what’s on the balcony table but I dare not touch it. You can smell the musty smell as soon as you enter the house. The appearance of the hotel is the biggest selling point, and it does produce movies, but the facilities and location have no advantages. The breakfast was very chaotic and the meals could not be kept up. It's a bit like gold and jade on the outside but lint on the inside.

msg:When I came to Gubei this time, I chose Hangu Villa, just in time for the final exam week of students. There were not many people and the price was reasonable. The overall living environment was very good and comfortable. The environment was quiet, especially suitable for daze.

🍃Environment: It is an open-plan hotel, next to the foot of the mountain, with winding paths, tents for afternoon tea, and an area where many children play. The overall is very beautiful.

🔔Service: The service staff of the hotel has a very nice attitude. We encountered some difficulties. We found Zhang Jian, the front desk supervisor. He was very professional and helped us. Thank him very much~ His attitude is also very good~

🧹Sanitation: The hotel facilities are relatively complete, there is also a swimming pool, and the water is very clean. The interior of the room is also relatively clean, and it will be sterilized before check-in. After we check in, we also ask the staff to let us sterilize it again~

🚗 Transportation: If you want to play in the ancient town, you may need to walk a little distance, but if you have come to the ancient town many times, Hangu is quite suitable to live in. The main reason is that we have come to the town too many times and don’t want to go shopping anymore. Staying at the hotel is more worthwhile, and you need to change to a shuttle bus in the middle~

msg:The shuttle bus from the scenic area does not go directly to the hotel. You need to walk for a while and take the hotel's special shuttle bus, which is not convenient. What's even more speechless is that upon checking in, I found the instant noodle bucket confiscated behind the door, the sheets had unknown spots, and the toilet had a serious odor. The hotel's a la carte dinner options were limited, and three dishes cost 600 yuan. Disappointed, will never come again.

If you book for the outdoor pool, you need to bring a swimming cap. We live in Building 1, which is the closest to the lobby and swimming pool, and the back is farther away. Maybe the scenery is better. I didn't see it. Rich breakfast. It is very close to the church on the top of the mountain, and it takes less than 10 minutes to go up the slope from the entrance of the hotel. It feels like a new world has been discovered.

msg:😘 The most comfortable hotel service

🍃Environment: The environment is very good👍
Low density. Trees block the line of sight between the building and the corridor, trying to balance light and privacy as much as possible! Sitting on the balcony, listening to the stream, the chirping of summer cicadas, and the occasional cool breeze... 😍😍
Needless to say about the room... clean and tidy, etc.
The key point is that there are no mosquitoes... For me, who is attracted to mosquitoes, this is heaven🤩 (there must be small bugs, after all, we are in the mountains... If you are afraid of closing the doors and windows, there will definitely not be any in the room... There are not many even outside, and it will definitely not affect the balcony) Blowing in a daze 🥳)

🔔Service: focus on focus
The young lady and young brother at the hotel are so nice😘
I've been to star-rated hotels. Their manners and language are also very good, but they have a sense of grooming.
The girls I met in Hangu felt that they were gentle from the bottom of their hearts... Especially the girl who delivered lunch to me would smile and chat with you with crooked eyes😘 (I'm on vacation and don't like programmed talk) )
For some of my needs, the ladies will try their best to ask... and they will really help find ways to meet my needs... Of course, not all needs can be met. After all, Superman is not omnipotent.

To be honest, the price of the hotel is not cheap. We stayed on Friday and Saturday for two nights, with an average of 3,000 yuan per night... but the service here really makes you feel that it is worth the price. You will come again (suddenly I have the motivation to work hard😜😜)

This is definitely a place where you can calm down from the restless city life...reboot yourself and start with a full battery.
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰

I also hope that the hotel can always maintain its
Of course it would be better to have “activities”😜😜😜

You can rent floating rows and swimming rings at reasonable prices. Walk up the hillside outside the restaurant for five or six minutes to reach the church on the top of the mountain. There is a Yunding Cafe next to the church, where you can enjoy the view of the ancient town. The configuration of the room is also great, capsule coffee machine, automatic toilet, automatic curtains, etc., very comfortable, thank you!

msg:This hotel is in the innermost part of Gubei. It is quiet and sweet, with its own style and unique architecture. It is suitable for couples to date. But it is not very friendly to families with children. From the parking lot, it is a ferry to the service station, and then from the service Take the ferry to Langu service station, and then from Langu service station to the hotel lobby. If you take children out to play, you will definitely have more luggage. In bad weather, it will be even more inconvenient. If there is a one-stop ferry service, the business will be better. Better, the hotel service is convenient and the service staff are enthusiastic and proactive, but the downside is the hotel breakfast, the less variety is the second, the food quality is not fresh, it is not ideal, there is no reminder to wear a mask during the epidemic, and the food is not covered.

We felt relaxed and had breakfast outside in the morning. I also experienced the swimming pool. It is tiring to swim deep in 1m2, but it is only for bubbles. It's a good place to relax. The tomato and egg noodles for breakfast are unexpectedly delicious. But I just want to complain about the shuttle bus. If I come directly from the parking lot, I have to change three times. I usually don't know which station to change at when I come back. It is suggested that it should be possible to pass through one stop, which adds too much inconvenience to the setting.

The breakfast at the hotel is very good, with a wide variety of varieties and good taste. The room layout is reasonable and the area is large, suitable for taking children.

I really like this hotel, it is suitable for rest in a daze, very beautiful and very relaxing! By the way, the drone show in Gubei Water Town is very beautiful at night. I originally came for a quiet hotel and didn't visit the water town very much. I recommend watching the drone show!

msg:I booked a deluxe room, because I saw that the view room was just a higher floor, and I didn't think it was too high to see how beautiful the road was, so I chose the deluxe room. The room is located on the first floor of Building 5, and you can see the small bridge below and the lush greenery, so I am very satisfied with the room type this time. The service, facilities and environment of the hotel are all very good. The only disadvantage is that it is a bit remote. The tourist center takes a shuttle bus to Shanshui City. It takes about 5 minutes to walk across a bridge and then to the ferry station in Hangu. After the car was delivered to the hotel lobby, it was arranged in Building 5, and then I took the hotel shuttle bus to the room. I took the luggage directly and did not check it in. This journey and the weather of more than 30 degrees really made me tired. Because I have been to the water town many times before, I have visited it several times. If it is the first time to come to the water town, it is recommended to stay in a hotel in the central area. During the epidemic period, dine-in is not allowed. The hotel provides two kinds of Chinese food and Western food. The Chinese food includes: shredded pork noodles with pickled vegetables, tomato and egg noodles, two bowls of porridge, pickles, cauliflower, boiled eggs and small buns; Western food includes: milk cereal, small bread, Bacon slices, fried eggs, sausages, green salad, fried mushrooms, and a portion of fruit. The waiter will deliver the meal to the room at the designated time. Personally, I prefer Chinese food. The taste is not bad. The bacon in Western food is too hard. It is suggested that Hangu should coordinate the scenic spot to have a direct shuttle bus for guests who have just checked in, especially in the hot summer.

In other respects, the breakfast is quite satisfactory, sweet potatoes are more delicious.
The lobby of the hotel is an independent building, and the accommodation areas are all independent buildings, which are very special.

msg:Hangu Villa is actually not too far from Gubei Middle. It takes 20 minutes to walk from the gate. If you have less luggage, you will pass by.
Because people who go after the Spring Festival are actually okay, and the rooms are relatively cheap. Maybe the manpower is tight after the Spring Festival, and the room is cleaned out at about 3:30. I took this time to go to the church on the top of the mountain, overlooking Gubei.
The room is still very warm when the heater is turned on, the surrounding environment is very good, and the room layout is also very reasonable. Very pleasant stay. The service is also very good, in place.
The breakfast is also very rich, because I didn't expect it after reading other reviews, but it is actually much better than expected, and I can eat and feel full.
It is recommended to go to Gubei to play or prepare more snacks by yourself. The food inside is really ordinary, and there is basically nothing you want to eat.

The room is very big and Japanese-style. Although it is a bit far from the scenic spot, The car pick-up service is very convenient. The children are very happy to live here, and said they will come again in the future! When I left, I forgot to take the child's gloves. I only remembered when I got home. Wang Ying from the hotel got in touch with me and mailed it to me! Thank you so much! The overall service is also very attentive! The breakfast is also very rich. When the spring flowers bloom, we will come to Gubei again, and we will still choose this place!

Although the location is relatively remote in the water town, the feeling of winding paths is too good. The room layout is simple and not simple. Outside the window is the cold winter in the north, covered with snow, and inside the window is the temperature of spring, warm and comfortable. The child is having a good time. It's a pity that I didn't stay for a few more days at work. I look forward to a better meeting next time.
The variety of breakfast is quite rich, but the taste is a bit salty. It is recommended to add more varieties and pay attention to national habits. The logo is clearer. The taste should also pay attention to low salt.
The room can add a humidifier, the northern winter is really too dry

First of all, on weekdays ➕ the epidemic has caused basically no people. We are a bit of a private room. It feels very quiet and beautiful. The weather is also very beautiful. I can’t help but sigh that it’s really a paradise. Consign to the hotel~ soon~ The environment of the room is also very good~ Japanese style has my husband’s favorite tatami... The water is also Simatai’s direct drinking water and a ticket is also given. All in all, very good and very satisfied... It’s nice to relax after work ! ! The pillows are not very comfortable.

🧹Hygienic: very clean and safe to live

🍃Environment: A beautiful hotel, although it is a little farther away from the downtown area, but it is quiet, the facilities are also very new, and the layout of the house is also very good

🔔Service: The hotel staff are very responsible and enthusiastic. We arrived at the hotel after 9 o’clock in the evening. The staff at the hotel’s front desk helped us with our luggage and took us to the door. Very considerate hotel with cookies. When leaving the store, the front desk staff Liu Ying went through the procedures and explained the route patiently. Very good experience

There are also many varieties of breakfast, suitable for all kinds of people. Freshly cooked noodles, Chinese and Western styles are very good

🚗 Traffic: The hotel is on the side of the mountain, very quiet, so there is some distance from the center of the water town, you need to go to the shuttle bus twice ~ but very fast! In addition, the shuttle bus is guaranteed for 24 hours, which is still very convenient, and there is no need to worry about travel problems. You can check your luggage directly to the hotel at the visitor center, saving time and effort!

🍃Environment: Nine three-story small buildings are scattered among the mountains, connected by a pedestrian plank road in the middle. There is a stream downstairs, and you can see a lot of wild flowers in summer, it’s amazing! The air is full of the fragrance of plants and trees. It’s really comfortable to take a walk around after dinner every morning! The room is very wide. There is a double bed room and a tatami bed in the room. The floor-to-ceiling windows have a great mountain view. It is very suitable for a family of three.

🔔Service: The service is very considerate! And there is a butler, who can answer questions at any time~ I especially like our concierge Hu Qi’s family, who has been very considerate since the check-in, which has added a lot of convenience to our travel.

I will bring my family again next time!

The management of Gubei Water Town itself is very standardized. From time to time, there is a phone call to remind us which parking lot to park, luggage transportation after arrival, and shuttle bus service. After arriving at the hotel, the front desk service manager Zhang Jian sent us to the room and introduced them in detail. Some precautions for staying and playing, and all the details of the service reflect that the management details of the entire scenic spot of Gubei Water Town are in place. There should be a very good management team.
Hangu Villa should be regarded as the hotel with the best environment in the entire scenic spot of Gubei Water Town. The small buildings in the mountains have a very good environment, and the Japanese-style decoration style is very distinctive.
The only shortcoming is that there are several cement boards in the children's amu*****t facilities in the hotel, and there are erected steel bars next to them, which is a bit dangerous. If the children are caught in disastrous consequences, the hotel should deal with them in time.

msg:Choosing to stay in Hangu on November 11, the overall feeling is still very comfortable. This comfort is really just a good environment! It is not very convenient for bringing a baby. The hotel is in the innermost part of the scenic area, and you need to call a shuttle bus to the front desk to get in and out. And now this season, the only open-air swimming pool in the hotel cannot be used. You can only go swimming or hot springs in other hotels far away, which is very inconvenient. In addition, there are many steps on the corridors to and from the hotel, so pushing the stroller up and down is particularly difficult! Maybe the holiday occupancy rate is high and the room service time is relatively long. After talking about cleaning the room in the morning, I only come at noon. It takes a long time for checked luggage to arrive in the room, and the experience is very poor. Also, a part of the tatami in the room is collapsed, and the toilet smells bad!

msg:Four brushes of Gubei, this hotel comes into view. Located in the corner of the ancient town, quiet and forest, suitable for lying down holiday.

Summer vacation is not a weekend of 2000, and weekends are 2500+, which can be regarded as the price of a first-line hotel in the suburbs of Beijing. The biggest advantage is that it is less crowded and quiet, with a total of eight buildings, each with three floors and three houses on each floor. Exclusively enjoy a valley surrounded by streams. The room is very large, it can be said to be a small two-bedroom, full of Japanese style, especially suitable for families with older children.

The outdoor swimming pool has a great view, and you can see the Simatai Great Wall. Tent afternoon tea is provided, and three hot spring tickets (optional Duanjia or Chengshang Hot Spring Pavilion) are given for check-in. The shuttle bus can be delivered to the town center at any time. It is actually three to four minutes on foot. The hillside next to it is very convenient to the church on the top of the hill, the best place to view the panoramic view of the ancient town.

Disadvantages: breakfast is relatively average, service awareness is average, and check-in time is late. Check-in needs to be handled in the lobby of the water town, and the waiting time is slightly longer. This price hotel should have a separate check-in channel.

msg:How many times have I been to Gubei Water Town, I basically live in the light of Gubei. I have also stayed at the Water Town Hotel and once in an inn. I always feel that this hotel is far away for the first time.
Location: It’s a bit far away, but it’s very quiet. Among the trees/flowers, I listen to the birds in the morning. It’s close to nature.
Room: In Gubei, the lighting is quite good. The room is basically the same as the photo. The four sides are full of glass. It feels really good. The decoration is Japanese. There are tatami mats. Although it contains two people, I will give you a set of beds on the tatami mats. The living room on the balcony is very transparent and makes people feel fully integrated in the natural environment. The room is also very clean! The minor drawback is that the balcony is prone to flying insects. The environment is indeed good enough. However, the hotel rooms are full of electric mosquito repellent liquid ➕ anti-mosquito spray is very complete. The toilets of L’Occitane for toiletries are Japanese. The curtains are all electric. The hardware is really OK.
Service: The staff are super eye-sighted to help with luggage. Seeing you will not hide or pretending to be invisible, you will be greeted in the restaurant. They will also take the initiative to help you take the tableware and serve dishes. They will also respond quickly to call for a car. Very polite
Breakfast: Compared to Gubei Light and Water Town Hotel, the categories are indeed a bit less. It must be because there are not so many guest rooms, but the quality is good, and there are all types. The quality is not bad at all
I personally feel that a room can live 4, the hardware and software are very good.

msg:Although the location of the hotel is slightly off, the check-in is relatively smooth. The front desk staff are very professional and the lobby manager is very enthusiastic and patient (a boy, although he wears a mask, he can also feel handsome, haha!). The design of the hotel lobby presents a strong a**osphere of modern art. The room has tatami mats, partial Japanese style, large floor-to-ceiling windows, and plenty of sunlight. Sitting in front of the window, looking at the blue sky, white clouds, and green trees, and hearing the sounds of birds from time to time, I instantly feel relaxed physically and mentally and return to nature.
The hotel’s shuttle bus service is particularly enthusiastic, but my children and I prefer to take our own luggage and walk all the way through the scenic corridor to our room. The lawn under the promenade is fertile, and there is also a small stream slowly rustling. There are 4 or 5 white tent rooms on the grass near our room downstairs to make the children yearn for. Consulting the lobby manager said that the tent room is under commissioning and will be opened to the public when the overall experience is better. The price is much lower. You can try it next time. Yes, there is an open space on the lawn just installed some solid wood children's entertainment facilities, next time Erbaolai will have fun. It's awesome, I look forward to seeing you next time. . . . . .

msg:The location of the hotel is quiet and quiet, which is very good. The hotel's hygiene is very bad. When you enter the bathroom, you can feel the smell of public toilets. After staying for three days in a row, the cleaning staff only changed towels and tidied the table slightly. There were water stains and tea stains, all traces of previous guests were still there. There are no coffee capsules added, the floor has never been vacuumed and cleaned, and there are all kinds of complaints about breakfast. No matter you are an adult or a child, it is what the restaurant can do to make you eat a few bites.

The decoration can be seen very carefully, although it is not so luxurious, but it gives people a very comfortable feeling. The overall service is very online, but there may be a lack of experience in responding to emergencies. As far as Gubei Water Town is concerned, I would recommend this hotel to my friends.

1、關於函谷酒店，適合多次來過古北水鎮的人，安安靜靜的休息，淡季出遊，整體感覺中規中矩，想找酒店借個小童浴盆，説了兩遍，酒店阿姨都沒拿過來，最後到第三遍，實在不忍心讓阿姨再跑一趟，算了。
2、關於古北水鎮，這裏再也不是十年前那個將最大善意釋放給遊客的古北水鎮了，從景區餐飲的定價、遊客服務中心售貨員的態度、小鎮動線的細節、基礎設施的維護、景區安全細節的考量，與2016、2017都有天壤之別，大概是失去的那三年，把小鎮高素質與有情懷的人才都流失了吧。
照目前這個服務質量，個人應該不會再來古北水鎮了。

現在遊客少，還給升了級，房間很暖和，後來問了是地暖➕暖氣，榻榻米也不覺得冷。也不會很硬。
早餐是提前確認中式和西式，營養搭配，有主食、蛋、菜和水果。想吃烤腸和煎蛋選西式，中式有粥和小饅頭玉米南瓜白煮蛋，總之中式和西式都很飽。稍微有點兒吃不完那種。咖啡很香
離店還想去司馬台長城，行李直接給託運到停車場，自己輕鬆玩。
含温泉票，到温泉館泡一泡，太舒服了。
總之，這次團建太滿意了。

msg:酒店位置在半山腰，從山下襬渡車站走上來也就300米，白天自己走走很舒服。從酒店到山頂教堂可以直接步行，不需要爬樓梯，很方便，也可以從山路繞行到望京街和日月廣場。環境很好，一條小溪從山頂流下來，一直穿過酒店，如果是春暖花開了，風景一定更美。喜歡坐在陽台或者榻榻米上看風景，喝茶。榻榻米睡下兩個人綽綽有餘，卧室的床是2米的，也很大。還有一個客廳和茶水吧，很方便。美中不足，這個季節山裡乾燥，房間很温暖，住了兩晚有點上火；設施稍微有一點舊。床單被罩枕套很乾凈，而且是類似粗布的，很舒服。酒店的洗澡水温很好，水流也很大，天冷在外面凍的發抖，回來可以洗個很温暖的熱水澡。早餐品種挺多的，中西都有。我早餐喜歡喝粥吃雞蛋和小菜，早上有至少5種粥，小菜品種也多，各種雞蛋類菜品足夠滿足我對早餐的要求了。喜歡西餐的，咖啡是現磨的，熱牛奶，麪包，蛋撻，酸奶，培根，烤腸都有，沒有嘗過，味道就不評價了。

早餐:品類多，味道好，吃到撐，每樣都值得嚐嚐

酒店的設施很好，房型設計有多個隔離的功能分區，能夠滿足家人的住宿、辦公、會客等需求，動靜皆宜。
酒店的服務很好，特別是前台王穎，能夠充分考慮客人的需求，響應很快，給人賓至如歸的感覺。
總之，下次來水鎮還會選擇繼續在這裏住宿。

游泳池關閉過早，尤其這麼熱的天氣。而且它規定7pm關閉，當我們6:40分下去，員工已經告訴我們説關閉，我説不是7點點嗎，他回答是我們需要清洗游泳池，那也就是説，他需要暫用客人的享用時間，來清洗游泳池。不是應該在7點之後嗎，我畢竟住的不是7，8百單價一晚的酒店，而是2000塊一晚。這樣的服務有點欠缺吧

msg:古水北鎮非常滿意的一次入住 儘管擺渡車有略微一些不便 不過度假腳步應該慢下來 早餐是五星標準 品類雖然沒那麼豐盛 但是基本都能滿足 服務都很專業到位 酒店乾淨衞生 3人房間如果有4人入住需要加收500元一人 古鎮擺渡車到酒店是三段，第一段從停車場到古鎮門口，第二段古鎮門口到古鎮內，第三段是蘭谷段，從鎮上到酒店，其中前兩段是所有入住古鎮酒店的都要乘坐的，第三段車程大概幾分鐘，走路也能到，有小孩的話走路可能略顯困難，還是建議乘坐擺渡車。

除此之外的亮點是小溪，有很多蝌蚪可以撈，還有小童設施，草地，很適合親子。

唯一需要注意的是季節，我定之前翻閲了最近幾年的所有評價，我發現八九月九十月會有集中關於臭大姐和一些蚊蟲的抱怨。六月這次去塗了點防蚊的，完全沒被咬，房間裏也沒有發現任何蟲子。作為這方面的潔癖，我很滿意。

房間的景觀比預期差，定的兩套高級套房，4月下旬時節，水鎮非常美，可房間景觀區光禿禿的啥也沒有，卧室還對馬路，跟賣家秀差異有點大

早餐還行，雖不比五星級酒店，但也挺多可選，如果天氣暖和，在室外吃早餐應該很愜意

離開酒店去景區停車場的方式好麻煩，酒店車衹能送到景區裏的酒店接待站，然後帶着長者孩子，拉着行李箱在景區石頭路上走半天才能到轉車的地方，轉乘去景區外的停車場

我認為需要加強的應該是早餐方面，和酒店價格真的不成正比。牛奶應該不是鮮奶，是奶粉沖調的味道……非常掉價，麪包也都很一般。

msg:疫情原因無法遠遊，因聽聞過多負面反饋原對古北水鎮基本不抱期望值，事實證明期望越低驚喜越多。遊客數量極少，導致遊覽體驗直線提升，但在工作人員數量大於遊客數量的前提下，依然顯露出了很多問題。
驚喜：
看得出景觀設定破費心思，做到了一步一景，做舊工藝也讓人十分意外，幾個重點景點也具有一定遊覽價值，並沒有糊弄遊客，雖都為人工景點，但在人少光環加持下體驗到了水鄉特色。
問題：
1、辦理入住時，前台人員拿走我的身份證件進行登記操作，我站在櫃枱前進行等待。在大廳十分之寬敞的前提下，工作人員未按照按照安全距離要求，將其他客户的物品放在我的手邊，並以十分近的距離緊挨着我進行景點介紹，（多説一句，整個辦理過程中沒有見到工作人員對包括我在內的其他客人進行介紹，大概這位客人比較特殊），近到貼身狀態時將我擠出了櫃枱，他們很自然的趴在了櫃枱上。。。絮叨了這麼多，其實就是我太慫了，應該當時直接對這個工作人員説：請排隊並保持安全距離！
2、擺渡車安排對於腿腳不便者很方便，但是中巴司機要等到滿員狀態才發車，電瓶車期間還出現了超載情況，超載人員為工作人員，蹲在了車門口，容易出現安全隱患。
3、入住函谷山莊期間，出現了工作人員未敲門進入房間的狀況，我問是誰她沒説話就關門了，然後她直接關上了門，我追出去後看見一保潔人員正在離開，後來我向酒店其他人員進行反映，對方笑笑説“那個保潔是新來的”，並沒有抱歉之意。。。這是重大問題了，酒店不重視嗎？
總結：景緻優美，物價合理但酒店較貴，人少時值得一去；工作人員亟需加強管理。

msg:此行住了兩個酒店，函谷很火 不好定。但是，衹能説一般吧，性價比非常不高。房間比較大是優點，但是衞生打掃的極其一般，其次早餐，可能比民宿強一點點吧，品種很少沒什麼可吃的，暑假去的，告知沒有酸奶，的確有點震驚。游泳池下水遊了半小時，室外沒有加熱裝置，所以遇到天氣涼一點就不行了，而且很小，來幾個，小孩就遊不開了。窗外景色也一般啊，不知道為啥能賣這麼貴，不太理解。
