Overall, it is very well priced considering the proximity to Disney and the standard of the hotel/rooms/service.

Cure kept asking about our requirements, provided free breakfast for the children and gave them a teddy bear toy. After a day at Disneyland, I was very tired and went back to the hotel to sleep and continue playing the next day. The hotel is in a good location and very convenient. The breakfast variety is very rich. The key is that there is a shuttle bus, which is very convenient and cost-effective.

Finally, I decided to give Cambridge Marriott a try! The results exceeded my expectations in all aspects!
First of all, the service~Cure manager took the initiative to contact me one day in advance to confirm the purpose and number of my trip~Because I brought two children, he helped me arrange the bed guard in advance and asked the room service to prepare two sets of children's products for me~When we arrived at the hotel, he was already waiting for us at the front desk~He also prepared the hotel's teddy bear dolls for the children~Remind me to make an appoin**ent for the hotel shuttle~Recommend my entry time~I casually said that the baby stroller I rented at night would be delivered~When I came back from dinner, it was already delivered to my room! (Very attentive, because there was only my phone number on the stroller, no room number~so it was really attentive!)
After checking in, I was very satisfied with the layout and hygiene of the room! Mothers with children should be very concerned about the size of the bed~cure also helped me upgrade the room type~1.4m twin room fully meets my needs of taking 2 children~
Room service is also very good~demands are responded to very quickly~
Breakfast is perfect~very suitable for our family's appetite~children tend to eat more white food...breakfast oa**eal, yogurt, many choices~and Benedict eggs (a small suggestion~can not be fully cooked~)My husband needs iced American coffee, and the restaurant also arranged it for us~the overall experience is very nice!
In addition, the hotel's swimming pool and gym are also very good~there is also a small children's playground~sanitary, and the service of the staff is very good!
This time I think I will lock in this Disney hotel in the future!

Pictures straight out~mainly sincerity~hahahahaha
Like satisfaction~

Marriott Group's requirements are still guaranteed~
Friends who pursue cost-effectiveness but have requirements for accommodation, go!

The hotel seemed to have no responsibility at all. There was no substantial apology or compensation. I can't believe this is a Marriott Hotel!!! Bad review!!!

I changed rooms once, and they only needed to hand over my luggage to the room for me. On my last night, Ctrip There was a price difference, and they kindly allowed me to stay in the original house. During a period of great difficulty in life, in such a rainy and cold Shanghai, I left the hospital and returned to the hotel every night, taking a hot bath, a comfortable and warm big bed, and a clean and tidy environment. Marriott made me feel the warmth of Shanghai. . In addition, there are no places to eat near Shangzhuang. The four restaurants in the hotel are all very delicious. You can also pack soup and porridge for my father. You can have food and accommodation at the Marriott, which makes the trea**ent of the disease less depressing and feels like a vacation!

msg:This is my second time staying at Kangqiao Marriott. The room was neat and clean with no peculiar smell, and the room service was prompt. The breakfast is rich in variety and provides full energy for the day. The swimming pool feels great too! The children also experienced the children's amusement park. Although the venue is not big, the children's happiness is not determined by the size of the venue. The hotel is a 10-minute drive from Disney and the price/performance ratio is very high! Five-star recommendation! I will still choose here next time I come to Disney. After praising me, I would like to make some suggestions. I suggested that the hotel attendants should be equipped with walkie-talkies. When I arrived at the hotel, Xiaobao fell asleep. I didn’t bring my room card with me, so I asked the front desk to help me swipe the card. They asked me to go to the concierge, and I asked him to go to the concierge. I went to the concierge with my baby in my arms. If there is a device like an intercom headset, the front desk can directly communicate with the concierge instead of letting customers run back and forth with their babies!

msg:This is the first time I’ve given a negative review on a hotel I booked on Ctrip, and it’s still a five-star hotel!
1. After booking for two nights, the air conditioner was always cold. When asked why, it was said that a foreigner felt hot so he changed the air to cold. It is winter here in China. Even if the temperature is a little higher during the day, the whole hotel will not be the same as an ice cellar. Bar! What's more, I almost caught a cold since I brought my baby here! so funny! They said it had been turned on to warm air, but it didn't turn on until check-out. I was also confused, couldn't I adjust the air conditioning to my own needs?
2. Let me complain about the aromatherapy in the lobby. It is the most unpleasant smell I have ever smelled. I just pinched my nose and ran away!
3. There is a cancer hospital opposite the hotel. It doesn’t feel good during the Chinese New Year, so choose carefully if you mind it as much as I do!
4. It’s not that close to Disneyland. The so-called shuttle bus won’t wait for you even a second late. I also remembered the reservation time incorrectly, but luckily I checked it. When I came back from a day at Disneyland, the shuttle bus was parked in the farthest parking space from Donald Duck. You can make up the picture yourself!
5. As a five-star hotel, the pillows and mattresses are not as comfortable as the All Seasons. The water bar in the room is empty, and there are a few bags of tea bags and instant coffee in the drawer. It is really surprising that this is a Marriott!
6. Except for the large room size and the decent breakfast, the rest of the hotel really makes me feel that it is not worthy of the price! I asked for a welcome fruit from noon until evening, and asked for it three times...
7. It’s best not to look at the scenery outside the hotel window. My room faces a wall!
Ps: I don’t recommend this hotel as a person who brought my children to Disneyland, and I will never come back again. This is the worst experience in Ctrip’s hotel booking history!

msg:When we arrived at the hotel to check in at 9:30 pm on October 22, we were told by Lavs at the hotel front desk that we must have the original ID card. After communication, electronic ID cards and photos of ID cards were not acceptable, so we were asked to call 110 to ask. We remained silent throughout the process, and others were refused. Communicate and anger consumers with unwarranted and very unreasonable language. As a service industry, your company's front desk service attitude is extremely bad. I don't know how the waiters trained and managed in this way are qualified to work in your company. As a consumer, receiving such an attitude gives me a very poor experience.

The hotel has a round-trip Disney shuttle bus, which is very convenient. The service was very good. I checked in at 10:30 in the evening and asked for a bed surround.

Gina, Tim, Ives, Young, checked us in. All very polite and friendly.
Gina received us, checked us in, and arranged the room for us very well. Tim also answered all my questions. Yong patiently taught me how to place an order with SF Express and handle express delivery. He helped me eliminate mailing problems and booked a pick-up shuttle from Disney. The driver is also very friendly. He sends SMS reminders about shift times and responds to them in a timely manner, which is very nice.

The breakfast depar**ent is also very good, but unfortunately there are not many types of breakfast, and the gym and swimming pool are average. Of course, maybe this cannot compare with 5 star facilities. But the service is very good and makes people feel comfortable. I will stay at this hotel next time I come back to Disneyland.

Anyway, thank you for your hospitality.

msg:advantage
1️⃣The rooms are very clean and no dead spots were found.
2️⃣The service of the staff in all aspects is very good and the attitude is very good. I especially praise the amiable shuttle bus guy👍🏻When you check in, you will be prompted to choose between a street and a hospital.
3️⃣The shuttle service is very good. It’s on time and fast. It feels faster than taking a taxi. Moreover, the bus is more comfortable to sit on. Like the one we played in the game, we don’t have to worry about occupying other people’s seats if we put more things to buy next to them.
shortcoming
1️⃣The bedding is very rough and the material is very hard. It is estimated that it has been used for too long and it is recommended to replace it with a new one. My wife sleeps with a bathrobe on her pillow😅
2️⃣It was said that the buffet is famous and good, but after asking, the answer was that they only have weekend dinners, saying that "rare things are more valuable"? ? A buffet? ? I don't understand this logic
3️⃣The minibar did not have any bottled drinks. I was confused when I opened the refrigerator and it was empty. To charge for it, at least it must be in the room first, right? Is it possible that if I want to drink a drink, I have to call you first to report it and then deliver it? Thinking about the friends who made 2k+ reservations during the National Day, I feel so wronged
4️⃣I don’t know if it’s a problem with individual rooms. After the door is closed, you have to use some force to fully snap it shut. Otherwise, it opens as soon as you push it. There is no alarm when it’s not closed properly. It’s very unscientific! If guests don't notice, there will be a huge safety hazard.
Digression:
The taxi driver also said that your hotel is no better than the hotel next door, so you need to work harder.

When the front desk staff told him about this situation when he checked in, he just smiled and said nothing. I booked two rooms, one with a king bed, and the other one was wrongly booked because a child wanted her to help change the bed, so I had to fill in the 128 bad reviews! Obviously the booking price is the same! I have never stayed at such a bad Marriott. Toiletries were brought to me after asking twice!

There is one thing to say, Marriott hardware is still worth recommending. The space is also more comfortable.
But the cleaning aunt in this store is really powerless to complain. Now I think about it and I feel angry. The new shoes I bought, I went to Disney and found that the shoe box was thrown away. I don't understand why cleaning can throw away personal items in the guest's room at will, instead of putting them next to the trash can, and not checking out! ! ! Then I told the front desk that the problem was not solved, so I could only say sorry, I will bring you breakfast next time, what is the use of your breakfast! I flew around with my shoes in a plastic bag! ! ! Auntie came to my room and didn’t admit that she lost it, and later said that it was useless and took it away. She was really angry in the room with an innocent face, and then went downstairs and another cleaner asked the person next to me for water. Have you finished your drink? Empty the bottle! Is the cleaning in this store poor and crazy? Don't you train cleaning aunts in your store? ? ?
And I was asked to deliver water, but all the water I was given was scrap water, can I drink it?

msg:I stayed in Shanghai for a week, and I stayed here for a week. My child said he still wanted to stay at the Marriott Hotel. I read a lot of hotels at the beginning, and the reviews were different. In the end, I chose Marriott. I didn’t choose a homestay. I just liked Marriott as a brand. It focuses on cleanliness and safety. It’s soundproof and hygienic. It’s not as exaggerated as other bad reviews. The breakfast buffet is very rich, satisfying all kinds of tastes. There is no doorman or anything in the negative reviews. When we go out, there are doormen who pick up the luggage and open the door. I feel that I chose the hotel right this time.

msg:It is 7 kilometers away from Disneyland and a 15-minute drive. It was fine at first, but after checking out, I encountered something particularly disgusting! My companions bought pastries the night before and planned to take them to Disneyland to eat the next day. In the morning, because they were rushing to use their morning pass to enter the park, they left the pastries on the table under the TV in a hurry. We checked out at 7:30. At 8:18, someone traveling with us called the front desk and said that he forgot to bring a paper bag with bread. After he found it, he helped me put it with my stored luggage. However, he never responded to me. Wait. When I went back, I found that there was no such bag, and no one I asked knew about it. Then he said that he didn't find this thing, and called the surveillance camera and said that he didn't find the cleaning staff taking out this bag when cleaning up the room. That's strange. How could something disappear out of thin air?
Then I can only have two doubts
1. After I left the room and before the cleaning staff entered, someone entered the room and took away something. That means the hotel's security has serious safety hazards...!
2. If the housekeeper sees something and takes it as his own, then it’s a matter of character. If the items left out by the guest are of higher value, it’s a case of theft.

We can provide the purchase records of things, and the hotel surveillance can see that we did not take the things with us after going out. Things cannot disappear out of thin air. There are only two possibilities mentioned above. The attitude of the hotel duty manager is difficult to understand, regardless of Is it to cover up safety risks or to cover employee theft...!
There's nothing wrong with 180, but for a brand like Marriott, it's really unacceptable to handle the problem like this. There are other options around the park. I regret choosing this place.

msg:The hotel is not bad in all aspects, and the breakfast is also very rich, but it doesn't suit my taste, it's more western style, everything else is ok. However, as a benchmark for going to Disney, there should be more admission tips and active introductions, such as the half-day ticket, which was not actively introduced, and we found it ourselves. It is also best to set up a place for takeaway at least in the hotel lobby, what do you think about putting it outside, not to mention whether it will be stuffy in this hot day, there are so many mosquitoes outside, it is also unhygienic to attract insects.

The hotel has a shuttle bus, which is very convenient. The hotel room is basically Marriott standard, but it may be a little old. The interior decoration is a little damaged, which affects the appearance. After all, it is a Marriott international five-star hotel
There are many kinds of breakfast in the hotel. I would like to mention the Italian restaurant in the hotel at night. It’s really delicious. My god, the pasta and risotto are eaten until the CD-ROM. The family members who live in this hotel promised me to eat it.

From the first moment I got off the taxi yesterday, the man who picked me up at the door was very enthusiastic to help me carry my luggage out of the car. This was also the case every time I took a taxi and when I left the hotel today. The weather was very cold but the service was impeccable. The two guys at the hotel concierge were also very warm and considerate. They also helped me take my luggage to the room and patiently answered all my questions. Thank you very much. Also yesterday afternoon, Ms. Liu, the cleaning lady on the 9th floor, specifically asked for her last name because the service was so good. Overall, this stay experience and the quality of every service staff I met are definitely the industry benchmark. I will definitely stay here again next time.

It needs to be pointed out that red bedding is needed for wedding reception, and the bedding I brought did not match the size of the hotel. The staff contacted me by phone and gave me the hotel's red bedding, so that my Chinese wedding did not leave any regrets.
Thanks to the concierge for a lot of moving items during the period.

Once the ground is full, they will be driven to the ba*****t to park, and most of the underground parking lots are lift parking spaces, which is a bit difficult for commercial vehicles. Secondly, the room arranged in the north, the roar of the machine will not stop no matter day or night, it is difficult for a person who usually sleeps in seconds to fall asleep. The sound insulation of the room is also poor, and the sound of the door opening next door and the sound of talking in the corridor can be heard. Lastly, the pillows in the hotel are extremely uncomfortable, a disaster for someone with a strained neck!

msg:Maybe it’s because expectations are too high! Walking into the lobby, it feels spacious, bright, and a**ospheric, with a fragrant aroma. I think this hotel is great! When checking in, the front desk asked if I had brought a toothbrush. I was shocked. Do hotels not even provide toothbrushes now? So I got my toothbrush at the front desk and took the elevator upstairs. As soon as I got out of the elevator, there was an airtight smell, like a closed room that had not been occupied for a long time. I endured the smell and entered the room. The sofa inside was very old, even It was already dilapidated and dirty. What I want to complain about the most is the toilet in the room. It felt like it was overflowing after flushing. It was completely blocked. Since we returned to the hotel late and the children had to rest, we didn't respond to the front desk, so we had to go to the toilet all the time. The public toilet next to the restaurant on the floor is very speechless. The experience was very poor and I won’t come here again.

I took my wife and children to the restaurant for breakfast. After learning that I was not a Marriott member, I was told that my 9-year-old daughter needed to pay 99 yuan for breakfast. I instantly felt very bad. , not because I couldn't afford it at 99 yuan, but because I had stayed in so many hotels and never asked the children to pay for breakfast separately. I asked the waiter, if I don't want to eat, can my daughter go? The waiter replied, of course, sir; then I asked my spouse to take my daughter to dinner, and I went back to the room. What’s even more funny is that after I returned to the room, my spouse called me, and the waiter found my spouse and said, I’m going to The one I got was an executive room, and I could take my children to have breakfast, so I could go back to the restaurant to dine! Ha ha! Do I miss your breakfast? This experience really made me not in the mood to eat (later my wife also told me that the quality of the breakfast was indeed not that good). I understand that the hotel's business philosophy may be to make profits, so we will not mess with it, but I don't understand how much a 9-year-old girl can eat from you. This Marriott experience is really not good. . . . . . .

After consultation, the hotel said that many people came to buy half-day tickets, and shirked responsibility to let customers complain to Ctrip. It is disgusting that a five-star hotel does not immediately remove the adverti*****t after encountering a problem, and continues to display on Ctrip and in the store that it is a Disney agreement hotel that can buy half-day tickets.

Besides, the parts that need to be strengthened, some accessories in the room are broken, so they should be replaced Overhauled in time, the breakfast was quite satisfactory, the fried eggs were delicious, and the noodles in chicken soup were tasteless. Finally, let me explain why Marriott, which is not cheap, doesn't even have a welcome fruit. I don't understand this.

msg:The hotel is located on the side of Zhoudeng Highway. It is more convenient to drive in and out, and the surrounding environment is not bad. However, the design of the hotel room is a bit unusual. The room and the bathroom are separated by a sliding door, and there is no shelter between the toilet, the bathroom, and the washstand. Of course, it is no problem for one person to use it, but it is not convenient for two people to use it at the same time.
Another thing is that the hotel's breakfast variety seems not enough for a five-star hotel.

The front desk and the concierge service are very good. Every time the door and the concierge are dragging large and small rolls, they are very active in helping to get them, and their attitude is also very good. The service in the canteen is also very good.
The only fly in the oin**ent is that the standardization of cleaning is a little lacking, just a little bit, for example, the fruit delivered on the first day was not finished, and the leftover apples and pears were taken away the next day... Then After cleaning the toilet by myself, the stool was sticky and I didn’t flush it out. When I came back at night, I saw that there was still some yellow residue in it and I didn’t clean it up completely. (Although it’s my own, I feel that I can clean it up and then flush it out...😅) . There is nothing else, if the cleaning is very standard, I will give you 8 points when I stay in your house this time. I used to live in other five-star hotels, some of which have good cleaning and can score 9.5 points

When I checked in, the girl at the front desk made me very dissatisfied. It did not reflect the high-quality service of the Marriott Group at all. Heartfelt I think Marriott's service has also dropped too much, but I don't care if she is about the same age as her child. The next day, because a patient wanted to bring some breakfast, the handsome manager of the restaurant was very kind and helped me bring the packing belt. , told me to bring some light food and some fruit, thank you very much! I need to continue the stay the next day, because there is a patient, I went down early to handle it, because the order did not arrive, the lady at the front desk, Jamie, was very caring, told me it was okay, she could help me with the follow-up, and she came to wait, and then asked me if I was satisfied with the hotel , I talked about the situation on the first day, she immediately apologized to me and sent fruit, the order number on the first day has not yet paid, and I have to wait in the lobby for an hour! This comparison makes me not know what to say! Because of the handsome manager of the restaurant and Miss Jamie at the front desk, I will still choose Marriott, and I hope that other Marriott employees can also make guests feel truly at home!

If you feel that it is not good for takeaways to come in and out of the hotel, then you should arrange for service staff to help guests get them, instead of leaving them completely, neither letting others deliver them, nor helping you to get them; then why stay in a 5-star hotel for the sake of the environment? The environment is average and the pictures are clean? It didn’t feel clean either: anyway, I didn’t check in for the second time!

The refrigerator is empty and there are no charged snacks. The coffee is also instant in bags. Except for room cleaning, there are no other services.

msg:I sincerely comment and vomit blood to avoid lightning for all consumers. This hotel is the most rubbish hotel I have ever stayed in so far. It completely bullies consumers. I hope everyone will see my tearful statement and never stay here. It is a proper hotel. Black shops are designed to deceive consumers, push them to the ground and bully them. If you really live on the street, don’t live in this dark shop. You will regret it for the rest of your life! What happened was that I came to Shanghai for a business trip over the weekend and booked a room with Ctrip for two nights. Suddenly my employer had other arrangements and I was going to another place in Shanghai on Saturday. I couldn’t stay in the hotel. I communicated with the hotel and they asked me to check out directly at the front desk. , just apply on Ctrip. We went to the front desk to check out at 12 noon. The front desk said that we had made a note and just left. They would tell the reservation depar**ent then. Then I just arrived in Xindi in the afternoon. Ctrip called me and said that they applied to the hotel and the hotel did not agree to check out. I was angry and called the hotel. The front desk told me that there was a note record and I would give feedback to the reservation depar**ent to resolve it. As a result, until the evening, Ctrip told me that the hotel still disagreed. I called the hotel front desk and reservation depar**ent, but they directly told me that you just put the room card at the front desk and the room was still reserved for you, so I couldn't Even if you check out, all room charges will be deducted! I'm going, I'm speechless. I didn't expect that in the 21st century there would be people like this who tell lies and bully people to the point of being bullied! I was so angry that I took an hour's drive from the suburbs of Shanghai to the hotel at night and argued with them until my lungs came out. It turned out that a bunch of hotel people didn't care about you at all. Let me tell you, our colleagues in the reservation depar**ent are off work and can only go to work tomorrow. Processed, speechless. Then the next day, I called from morning till night, but the hotel ignored me. Every time, they told me that you let the platform handle it, and I would contact Ctrip. Ctrip told me to communicate with the hotel repeatedly, but the hotel just disagreed. Then in the afternoon, the hotel phone number was disconnected and they told me that they would not resolve the matter. The contract stated that no refund was allowed. I was so angry that I cursed and then hung up on me. In this way, the 2,000 room fee was paid to me without staying. I am really speechless that such a black shop can survive in Shanghai and China. I sincerely wish Marriott to close down soon! Go bankrupt soon! We also sincerely advise all consumers to stay away from Marriott and cherish life! Finally, this hotel is really in bad shape. The rooms are old and messy. The funniest thing is that no sanitary ware is provided. They are found at the front desk. Each person has a toothbrush and a piece of soap. It is more expensive than the hourly rooms on the street that cost 40 a night. Not as good as. I sincerely protect everyone from lightning. I hope no one will encounter such deceptive black spots! I sincerely wish Marriott will go bankrupt in 2023 and lose everything!

First of all, the hotel is facing the cancer hospital, and you can see it when you open the window. When I checked in at around 16:00 on the same day, I told the front desk that we had two rooms for my family of three. Could they be on the same floor for easy care? The front desk said no, it had not been cleaned, so we said we could wait and I would go to a room to rest first. , when the cleaning is completed, we will come down and get the room card. The front desk checked again and said it was yes. He went to communicate with us and then contacted his superior, who must have been there. Then he came back immediately and said no, and asked us to wait until the next day to change rooms. Then when we got to the room, we called Ctrip to help coordinate. Within 5 minutes of Ctrip's call, the front desk informed us that a room was available and asked us to go down and get the room card. It was really funny. Then after getting another room, I didn't stay in it and went out directly. When I returned to the room around 10 o'clock in the evening, I found that there was beverage garbage in the trash can in the room. . There was no cleaning, and I was speechless. I called the hotel front desk to complain, and then the front desk said that the manager would contact us the next day, but he didn't. The air conditioner in the room was also broken and kept dripping, so forget it. When checking out, they collected the card and asked me to leave directly without any confirmation. I also asked and said there was no confirmation either? The front desk said no, the deposit will be refunded. As a result, just 5 minutes after the car drove out, I received a text message that the deposit was withheld. Speechless, this is the first time I have encountered this situation after staying in so many hotels. I called the hotel and said that no one answered the phone at the front desk. I also contacted Ctrip and asked me to confirm that we bought a swimming cap. We have never been to the swimming pool. This fee There was no confirmation from us about the direct deduction. I really have never seen a hotel do this, and it was still a five-star Marriott. I went to confirm it later and they said they had no money and they refunded it. These three days have really opened my eyes. I have been a member of Ctrip for almost 10 years, and this is the first time I have received a negative review. It is an eye-opener. In addition, the bathroom sink in room 2119 is very moldy. Even when you brush your teeth and lower your head to wash your face, there is a musty smell. This kind of mold is not good for your health. I advise you not to stay in this hotel if you can, and spend your money to suffer the consequences.

1. According to Ctrip, Mingming swimming pool is open from 6:00 to 11:00 every day. We went to the scene to talk about the impact of the epidemic, all the swimming pool children's playgrounds were closed, and other hotels in the key surrounding areas were open. Originally, I took children to play, and I chose them only because they had a swimming pool.
2. Negotiated check-out, the attitude of the front desk is extremely arrogant, and they will not return, nor do they have any positive suggestions to discuss compensation for upgrades, just ask us to find Ctrip, Ctrip also said that the hotel will not refund, I booked for three days, I said I stayed One day, the next two days back, no good
3. Living on the 21st floor, there is a strong smell of sewage
4. Go to bed at night, the tile next to the bathtub fell off
In short, this time refreshed my understanding of Marriott

The arrangement is a room facing the cancer hospital. Although I don't like it very much, I was told that the room is full, so I can only accept it
But what I can't accept is the sound of dragging the trash can downstairs at 11 o'clock in the evening, and the sound of the garbage truck collecting garbage at 4:30
The sound insulation of the door of the room is poor, as long as someone talks in the corridor, it seems to be in the ear
The next day, I responded to the front desk and asked to change the room, but I still said that there was no room.
At my strong request, I can only say to see if there is a room when I come back at night
But the speechless thing came, when I came back after seven o'clock, not only did I still say that the room was full, but the room was not cleaned for me. I won't tell you if I don't take the initiative to ask, let alone call you.
I had no choice but to call and ask, and said that someone would be arranged to clean it immediately.
I waited another 20 minutes like this, I was really sleepy, so I gave up.
If it is not for the trust in Marriott, there are many hotels in this resort area, so why live in such a place.
Marriott has been black all his life.

msg:Quite satisfactory, the breakfast room and so on are normal business five-star hotels.

But let me say something about the shuttle - a reminder to Disneyland guests who book the shuttle. I booked two rooms and made an appoin**ent with the hotel for the shuttle bus back to the hotel at 10:05 in the evening. My friend and I are 2 adults, with a 3-year-old, a 6-year-old, and a 7-year-old child, a total of 5 people. The hotel sent a message at night to remind you to get on the car in advance at the Donald Duck parking lot and leave on time. I thought the time would be fine.

When watching the fireworks, we were in the first row of VIP seats, and we were naturally the last batch when we left. We rented three strollers to push three children, followed the flow of people to the gate, and returned the strollers to the park It took the service center 3 minutes to ask the staff about the location of Donald Duck's parking lot. It took 5 minutes for the child to go to the toilet, and he looked at the watch, and it was 10 minutes before the departure time. The staff said that the Donald Duck parking lot had to walk across the overpass, which was quite far, so we started running wildly. The three-year-old couldn't run, so she held her in her arms and ran. When she ran to the parking lot, it was exactly 10:05. Then quickly find the location of 319 that was prompted --- but Nuoda has a parking lot full of buses, and 319 is actually the farthest and farthest location in the third row! We started running again --- we ran to 319, it was 10:10, and we couldn't find the car -- the car left.

Advise guests who have watched the fireworks and go back to the hotel, if you have not practiced scud, and you have a younger child, you will really miss the car. Otherwise, it would be a pain to wait for a taxi with the children in the cold wind and rain. After all, the temperature at night is only 0 degrees.

Arrived at the hotel around 10:40 to check in, the child was too sleepy, there were more than a dozen people in front of the queue, and the speed was very slow, the worst thing was that there was no guide, and the people next to him kept cutting in line, I told one of them , he gave me the seat again.

Just sauce.

msg:After staying in so many hotels, this is the worst stay experience. The worst of the worst. 1.4 We checked into the hotel at around 9:00. We told the front desk that we had children before check-in. We arranged a twin room. We washed and dressed the two children. We went to bed at around 11:00. My eldest daughter and I were woken up by loud talking and laughing. There were also constant "bang bang" door slamming in the corridor. We called the service desk at 11:30 and asked them to take a look and remind the residents not to be so loud. After that, we fell asleep in a daze. At around 2:00 in the middle of the night, we were woken up by a burst of **** screams. The children didn't understand what the sound was. I don't understand why the sound insulation of a five-star hotel is so poor. I realized it when I woke up in the morning. There was a door on the wall of our room, which was connected to the next room. The rooms in a five-star hotel were not independent. As a result, we shared a suite with the young people next door all night and enjoyed several hours of harassment. This is Marriott's service and the deep memory that Marriott brought to our mother and daughter. We slept for three hours in the hotel that night. 3 hours! ! !
When I checked out the next day, I told the hotel about my experience. The hotel could only say sorry. They didn't think that this arrangement was inappropriate, didn't think how profound the impact on the children was, and didn't consider the hardship of me, a mother, raising two children. This experience made me deeply doubt Marriott's brand and had a new understanding and experience of the so-called five-star hotel. Is it the peak season now? Are there not enough hotel rooms now? Do you need to arrange such a room? A five-star hotel would have such a room? ! Amazing! ! 
I can only say that it's too! Bad! ! It makes people feel disgusted!

He said he was not the doorman and ignored the child. Later, the adults went down to ask the doorman to help with the luggage cart! During the epidemic, I went out one night and came back after 10 o'clock in the evening. No one cleaned the room, so I asked the hotel front desk to call cleaning to help clear the trash can and change bath towels! The attitude of the cleaning service who came in was extremely bad. If you opened the door without saying hello, you would rush into the bathroom and throw your face and throw garbage. Finally, when you ask her about her attitude, she will tell you to make a complaint, just make a complaint, and slam the door and leave! Really hard to believe this is the service of a 5 star hotel!

He can discover the needs of the guests at the first time, respond as soon as possible, and delight our stay experience. He is also very responsible, even after the night shift. Time is also worrying about our stay throughout the whole process. Say thank you here!
Hardware: The hotel is located near our home, so I came to stay for one night during the rest time. The facilities are relatively new. The lobby and rooms are well maintained and maintained. The room area is also relatively spacious and has a wide field of vision.
It is a pity that the check-in time happened to meet the epidemic, and the restaurant was not open for dine-in, so we can only dine next time.
Service: Very good, I asked the staff to send some more mineral water. I don't know whether it was the switchboard or the front desk who answered the phone. I didn't act impatient because I called for water several times. On the contrary, my attitude was always good.
Very good hotel, I will continue to choose here after the weekend.

Arrived early, the hotel usually can only check in in the afternoon, but I still asked in the mood to give it a try. The handsome guy at the front desk, Horace and a beautiful woman received us. After understanding the situation, they helped to check in in advance, and they also did Room upgrade, very happy to have a place to rest at noon. A relatively new hotel, the room is clean and bright, and it is quiet at night. The curtains are also very good at blocking light. It is very convenient to walk a few hundred meters to the hospital. Thanks to the hotel staff for their enthusiastic help, making this visit a pleasure heart~

Knowing that it was uncomfortable for the old man to build a big quilt, he changed two small quilts. The old man was not feeling well, so he didn't go downstairs to eat breakfast. The breakfast restaurant brought the packaged chicken porridge and bone soup noodles to the room. It was really for the sake of the guests. The service quality of Marriott is really good, and I will choose Marriott for my next trip.

msg:Very objective, except for the service, I gave 4 stars, and not all bad reviews for objective reasons. I have stayed at your hotel at least seven or eight times in the past six months. Praises are given every time. Mediocre hotel. This time, it was because I left the hotel one day earlier. When I checked out, I specifically asked the front desk for the check-out time and was told 12:00, so I checked out at 12:00. The front desk specifically told me to find a third party for a refund, which is Ctrip. I also immediately left a message to Ctrip to inform that I had left the store. The next day, after Ctrip communicated with the hotel, the hotel told Ctrip that they could not refund or reschedule their stay, so inexplicably, they were deducted for an extra day. I have been booking rooms on Ctrip since the year Ctrip existed. If you don't check in on time on the first day, the room fee will be deducted for one day, I agree. The booking page does not say that you cannot leave the hotel early. I am also a Marriott member. I just can't figure out why the restaurant looks so ugly? The most disgusting thing is that I didn't dare to tell me not to retreat, but let Ctrip take the blame. When communicating with Ctrip, I told Ctrip that I would leave the store at three o'clock. I'm about to vomit, the employee who said this should quit automatically. After I left the store at 12 o'clock, I had already driven to a decoding center about 5 kilometers away from Marriott at 12.20 to do nucleic acid. Besides, in the era of big data, your hotel does not have monitoring, and there is also public monitoring! Dare to tell such a low-level lie. It's disgusting to lie and shirk responsibility. There are not many hotels in this location. Next time I go, I would rather go to another hotel. Never see Marriott again. I hope your leaders can see

Arrive at 10 o'clock, if there is a clean room, the front desk will check in immediately. We just waited for someone, took the room, and had a cup of coffee at the cafe on the first floor. The cake was beautiful and delicious. It is totally unexpected that Shanghai suburban industry can eat such a colorful cake.
In the evening, Disney drove 10 minutes away and checked in after coming back. Did not take pictures. But there is a humidifier service, if you feel dry when you turn on the air conditioner in winter, you can call the service bell to request. Breakfast is ok, but small wontons and individually packaged yogurt are missing. This star hotel should not be Austrian! But overall good! Next time I come to Disney, I will still come to the Marriott Hotel! ! ! Finally, go shopping in Bicester.

2. Breakfast: The variety is very rich, there are all kinds of fruit and bread snacks in both Chinese and Western styles
3. Services:
- When checking in, Jamie at the front desk of the hotel carefully confirmed our preference for the location of our accommodation, and gave us a thumbs up 👍
- When returning from Disney, I made a reservation for the hotel's bus, and I received a text message an hour or two in advance indicating the location of the bus. When we arrived at the designated place, in a row of cars, only this hotel made an indicator sign, which can be seen at a glance from a distance, and the service is reflected in these details.

Especially the boy who made the omelette, he was very impatient when he pushed me and looked like he owed him money. It was the first time I went to get the omelet and asked me to wait three minutes before coming back. Obviously no one was lining up, so I went. At the time, he fried a lot of them and didn't give them to me, and asked me to stand there and wait. I was very angry, but it was not easy to think that others were working hard, but he kept looking at me, and I said, do I have to wait? He said impatiently for a while! It sucks!

I asked her for the leader's phone number, and she said that the leader could not be contacted after returning home for the Chinese New Year. I asked her to leave her contact number and answered me that she could call at the front desk of the hotel! Later, the hotel director came forward the next day, although his attitude was good. However, the communication with the hotel was fruitless afterward due to the distress caused by the wound! The official reply of the hotel is based on the result of the insurance company's handling, which gives me the feeling that it is a dump! There are safety hazards in hotel facilities!

It was unexpected that we had to queue for 30 minutes at the door for breakfast the next day.

Breakfast is pretty good, there are many choices

On the side are the Cancer Hospital and Shanghai International Medical Center, which are also probably built as supporting facilities.

After calling several times, I finally understood the situation: it is urgently repaired, and I don't know when it will be better. I had no choice but to go to b1 to take a bath. The children waited all night and didn't wait for water, so I was very disappointed that they couldn't take a bath. . In the end, the water came in the middle of the night, and no one took the initiative to contact to apologize or explain the situation from beginning to end. .

msg:Oh yo, if you don't send me a message and ask me to comment, I'll forget, since I've been asked to comment, I'll come to complain...
During the Chinese New Year, there was only one aunt who cleaned the room. The check-in was at 2:10, and the room card was received at 4:30. There was also a room that received the room card at 5:00... It was said that the door lock was broken, and it was being repaired.
Then there is the water cut off... It's hard to imagine that a relatively high-end hotel can cut off the water for so long... The water didn't come until nearly 11 o'clock, and I called to ask that it would always be half an hour... and said that the water would definitely come today anyway...
Finally, I complained about breakfast... queuing for breakfast... queuing at the door, saying that there was no seat... My friend went in first, came to pick us up at the door, and we were put in ahead of time... and found an empty seat by myself... very little food... still There is a block at the door...is separated by a partition, many people don't know there is this area...the large area in the middle is the back kitchen...I can only say that this arrangement is quite unreasonable...
This is the first time that I have encountered so many problems in a hotel for one night. The most depressing thing is that the hotel has never taken the initiative to inform me of all these problems, and there is no plan... I will repeat our problems, please wait a moment. ...why should I pay for your problems? It's really strange to die... bad review, bad review, bad review, the experience of the New Year is too bad

msg:I have to complain about this hotel. It’s really bad. I asked for a box of water from the service center for 4 days and was refused. I said that I could only give you 6 bottles at most. I explained to the waiter that I need to make milk powder with a child over 1 year old. Sure it was too much, but it was rejected anyway. I took the children and the elderly to swim. I forgot to wear an adult swimming cap. I just brought a shower cap. I actually told us that we must wear a swimming cap before we can enter the water. Explaining that if we don’t swim for a long time, it’s not enough to accompany our children to play in the water. It is okay in any other hotel, even if it is not possible, at least the hotel will provide public swimming caps, but this hotel does not provide them, anyway, it just can’t. On the third day of the stay, the children’s playground suddenly closed and said it was the cause of the epidemic. I just wanted to say that it was a pleasure to stay in a hotel with children. Now I am restricted from swimming and can’t go to the children’s playground. What are we doing in the hotel, but I did not lose a penny at the checkout. This hotel is really unfriendly to children. It does not provide bed fences, no milk warmers, no milk bottle sterilizers, and hardware facilities are completely unable to keep up. The breakfast table is so good. The dishes are not removed, the dirty dishes are full of the table, and there is no service. I really don’t know how the Marriott hotel is so bad. It is really not suitable for bringing children. I would advise you not to stay in this hotel. I am really disappointed.

A little flaw is that I gave half an hour of wine if I wanted to delay the check-out. I don’t really believe it when I said that the house was tight on New Year’s Eve, and the shuttle bus from Disney was in the innermost place. I made a phone call and asked the hotel to get in the car at the last minute. I was afraid that the car would drive away.

When I vomited, no waiter came forward to deal with it. Watching our customers take care of themselves, they called them a lot before someone took care of it. The mangoes and papaya in the breakfast were cut with skins, which was very unhygienic. The dishes were very bad and hygienic. It is also dirty, just because of their service attitude and quality, it is not recommended for everyone to live, and the surrounding is not convenient. It's the worst Marriott I've stayed in

msg:No matter what I do, whether it is good or bad, I hardly give any comments. This time I really can't bear it anymore. I can't live here on a business trip. Anyway, I don't recommend it. The service is really bad.
The advantages first:
1. Toiletries are all my favorite thann
2. Breakfast is also very rich
shortcoming:
1. I only placed an order on Ctrip after I arrived at the store, and it actually made me wait for more than 10 minutes, saying that their system would not receive the order for a while. It was the first time I saw that even the economy hotel system can’t compare, let me Sitting awkwardly in the lobby for a long time.
2. I am a person who travels 300 days a year. I have stayed in any hotel. For the first time, I encountered a high-end hotel that charged a deposit of 500 yuan.
3. I called and asked for a bathtub bag, and it cost ten dollars. I have never seen any hotel that charges for a disposable bag.
4. It is also inexplicable not to invoicing on-site. I can't understand it. The attitude of the front desk insisting that I invoice online makes me think that she is the customer.
5. I ordered a takeaway and put it on the takeaway table outside the hotel. In such a cold day, it was cold outside. I don't tell you to deliver it to me in other hotels, at least arrange for a robot to deliver it.
6. The drinks in the small refrigerator are still charged, and 28 cans of Coke are also charged. When I stayed in other high-end hotels, they were all free drinks (although I didn't drink drinks, only mineral water) It made people feel very uncomfortable. accurate.

In general, the service is very poor, the front desk is arrogant, just think I'm a douchebag, I don't understand that your high-end hotel is probably the service quality, forget it, I don't know what this hotel is worth for the room fee of more than 800 The price, although I was forced to continue for one night today, I will move the place tomorrow, hey!

msg:We booked Hotel 1 in advance through Ctrip. 5 days before check-in, we had to go to the hotel late that night because of time changes. We contacted Ctrip hoping to cancel the reservation. Ctrip said that it was a special room, we booked through a third party, and the money had been paid by the third party. They would deduct the money regardless of whether we checked in or not, and said that the cancellation could not be made. In the end, we did not cancel the reservation. On the day of check-in, we drove 3 hours to the hotel at 11:30 pm. As a result, there was only one room left in the hotel. Sure enough, even if we had a room, the first thing we saw when we checked in and entered the room was the cancer hospital opposite the window. To be honest, it was a bit uncomfortable, so we discussed it with Ctrip and the hotel, but they did not agree to cancel the reservation. The hotel said that there were no other rooms and only one room left. You Marriott has so many rooms. The rooms are all full. Why didn't room 1521 get booked in advance? I don't need to tell you that everyone knows it. They called it coordination for us. They coordinated connecting rooms. It was just two rooms connected. There was another family living opposite. The middle door was locked. Or there was another room with irregular corners. It was obvious that these rooms were prepared for customers to exchange. They were rooms that no one wanted to stay in. The lobby manager himself said that no one lived in them. We stayed with our kids until 1 o'clock. In the end, we didn't check in. We paid the hotel money. The hotel and Ctrip refused to refund. This place is Disneyland. It is recommended not to stay here if you have kids. Especially if you have to arrive at the hotel very late, the remaining rooms must be that room. If you mind, I don't recommend taking pictures. In addition, in this matter, apart from the hotel, there was no humanity at all. Ctrip didn't play a role. They told me that third-party agents cannot refund, but they didn't even tell me which agency it was. I can only say that Ctrip, such a big company, really lacks humanity. A colleague encountered a similar thing in ** before. The customer service of ** and the warm-hearted coordination with the hotel solved the problem.

This time I wanted to change to a hotel due to some reasons. I chose Marriott by accident and found it really fragrant! 😂 Afterwards, Disney will play here! ! !
🚗 Transportation: Self-driving travel, it doesn't matter if it is a little bit, and there is a Disney scheduled shuttle!
🧹Hygienic: The sheets and quilt cover are very clean, that is, the bedside table and desk are quite dusty (the black glass sees it clearly...)
🔔Service: The service is very good. The lady at the front desk is very gentle, the lady at the executive lounge is also very good, and the lady at the Italian restaurant is also very polite. There is no such thing as poor service.

Overall, it's pretty good, there are not many hotel guests, quiet! For meals, the hotel’s restaurant prices are also quite affordable! In short, apart from the executive lounge which is a bit simpler (and the fruit is not sweet at all...), everything else is good! ! ! Recommend~

The medicine was for the child to take every day, so they had to carry it with them when they went out. In the subsequent handling of the incident, the hotel caused a lot of trouble to the guests: in order to claim insurance, the guests were required to provide a doctor's diagnosis certificate and a list of medicines (the doctor was asked to issue a certificate of the consequences of not taking medicines, but the doctor said he would not cooperate in issuing the corresponding claim certificate). The guest's important items were thrown away by the hotel staff by mistake, and the guest had to provide evidence again and again before compensation could be made. Why should the guests have to pay for the hotel's mistakes! The employees of the international brand hotel chain are so unprofessional that they throw away the guests' belongings at will. How does the hotel train its employees? Throwing away guests' important items at will makes you feel unsafe when staying in such a hotel. Bad review! Bad review! Bad review!

服務：我帶妹妹一起來的，迪士尼玩回來很累，睡到下午一點沒聽到電話。期間妹妹媽媽打電話給前台讓他們給房間打電話，接電話的前台是Alex，妹妹年紀小她媽媽擔心多打了幾個電話語氣比較急。打電話到房間是我妹妹接的，先説讓她回電話給媽媽，回答了很多遍他還一直在重複這個問題，後面來了句“你媽媽都對我破口大罵了”，當時我在衞生間沒説上話，妹妹直接被嚇哭了，我想問你Alex，你煩這件事是可以理解的，你為什麼把工作上的怨氣牢騷這樣“狀似無意”的發到一個小孩身上，這就是你的工作態度，或者説這就是你的素質？
還有我們取外賣的時候剛下電梯就聽到大堂裏一個瘦高有鬍子的服務員大聲的罵人，罵的很臟，雖然我不知道前因後果，但你在工作時間在大堂罵人真的有失風度
總之比較差的服務體驗

進到大廳很寬敞舒服
服務員態度都超級好也很熱情幫忙把沈重的行李搬到房間
不想出門也有客房餐飲服務超級方便
房間的真的非常舒服床很大還有浴缸
雖然附近餐廳不多但叫外賣打車都很便利
相對安靜許多客人的素質也挺好
早餐很好吃！選擇很多
價格上我覺得cp值非常棒👍！

一個酒店，不要求你硬件如何、不要求你微笑服務、不要求你讓顧客賓至如歸，最起碼的誠實守信總可以做到吧？！這家酒店，從實習生到值班經理，滿嘴謊話！自相矛盾！自己打臉自己！把顧客當**一樣糊弄？！
服務更爛，連最基本的開發票都開不明白，漏開！

msg:帶孩子來上海迪士尼，對比了多加酒店，最後選擇了這家老牌萬豪酒店。首先酒店環境和服務是沒的説，畢竟品牌價值所在，我訂的是連住兩晚，前台免費升級了行政房，房間很高也很大，景色不錯，孩子也喜歡。其次，酒店距離迪士尼樂園六公里左右，也算很近的了，並且有免費接送大巴車，早上從七點開始到十點，每小時都有兩輛車發車，晚上煙花結束後也都兩班的大巴接回去，而且都是提前預訂時間，晚上回來之前酒店禮賓部會給預訂人員發短訊告知時間地點和車牌號等訊息，免得誤了回酒店的時間，還是很人性化的。酒店的早餐種類不是很多，但是也夠大小朋友們選擇了，可以吃個飽飽的早餐，推薦吃餛飩和煎餅果子，味道不錯的，孩子吃了不少。由於我們一天都是迪士尼很晚才回來，所以酒店正餐沒有吃，無法評價，但是五星酒店味道應該也挺好的，希望有機會再去的時候可以品嚐一番。有一個小建議就是房間的洗髮用品和香皂都是生薑味兒，真的不太好聞，個人感覺有點打折扣了，如果換個其他的淡淡的清香味道的大家普遍接受的就好了，但願下次能有不一樣的改變！

床具讓人崩潰，尤其枕頭，兩個枕頭躺下直接是平的，沒辦法墊了個靠枕，而且枕頭和被子相當陳舊，發黑黃色，沒法跟五星級去關聯！

2.小童區衹有周四～週一開放

3.早餐！品類嚴重缺失！中式菜品幾乎沒啥東西！撤餐具不及時，滿眼都是桌子上用過的盤子碗！中餐現場製作的員工都是紳士，一個事兒你不多問幾句都不會回你！沙拉，水果區，菜品沒有，我竟然這兩年頭一次碰見五星級酒店，得等上菜！滿眼放去管事得似乎比幹活的多，咖啡機處連續幾天都是一片狼藉，排隊不説，經常杯子還有紙杯，上的都不及時。這五星級有點拉胯！

但是缺點還是有的
第一，酒店樓道里的地毯有明顯的發黴的味道
第二，行政餐廳的服務員態度略差，也可能是我遇到的那個服務員差一點
第三，入住時禮賓沒提拿行李的事兒，自己搬上來的

msg:奔着迪士尼來的，之前在小紅書做的攻略都推薦這家，而且打車過去也衹要一刻鐘左右，很方便，於是就選擇了康橋萬豪。
價格方面，相較於迪士尼的兩個酒店，這家真的是酒店非常實惠了。雖然住這家不能提前入園，但我算了一下，在康橋萬豪入住，再買早享卡的話，還是比入駐園區內的酒店更划算的。
環境方面，衞生非常不錯，沒有異味，房間也很寬敞，智能化家居讓人覺得非常方便，很舒服。
服務方面，入住的時候已經凌晨了，前台的Ricky和Cindy非常耐心，還幫我們解答了很多問題，很感謝兩位工作人員。
因為時間來不及，所以沒有在酒店吃早餐，下次再去上海的話也還是會入住康橋萬豪，希望下次有機會享用早餐~

2、餐廳雙標，頭天有看到客人打包早餐類，等到我打包點剩餘麥片，小朋友吃，怕浪費；餐廳説不行，我指出頭一天有人打包，她拿了一個簡易的打包帶。

msg:中國護照不能做為有效證件入住，衹有身份證和駕駛證作為有效證件，如果沒有這兩個有效證件之一，就需到當地派出所示具證明，這個酒店的規定，違反了中國相關法律，做為一個五星級酒店沒有去核實相關規定，而是隨意去執行，給客户帶來很大的麻煩，這説明這個酒店的管理層是有很大的問題的

msg:When going to Disney, don’t stay in this hotel. Disney’s two fireworks in the evening end at 8.30 and 9.30, and the shuttle bus deliberately arranged by this hotel leaves at 8.15 and 9.15. The fireworks are deliberately not allowed to be watched, and you can't take the bus to watch the fireworks. It is 1,500 meters from Disney to the shuttle bus, and it takes 20 minutes to walk there. You can't get a taxi there. Other hotels pick you up at 9 o'clock and 10 o'clock. If you can pick it up with Marriott, just pick it up. If you can't, forget it. Your 8.15 bus was basically empty. What’s the point of the arrangement? I seriously doubt that the hotel leaders arranged for their relatives and friends to come and eat the empty seats or get red envelopes privately.

msg:I booked a night's stay, and the next day I received an unknown call asking me to drive my Tesla away from the charging station provided by the hotel for free. Otherwise, I would be charged a station fee of *** yuan per minute. When I asked the person's identity, he said he was a hotel employee, and then he said he was a hotel property manager. He didn't provide his work number. So I drove the car out of the garage and went to the hotel to ask about it. Later, I reported it to the hotel manager. After checking with the property manager, I found out that he was not a property manager, but just Tesla after-sales. Because I needed to charge, he called and talked to himself to drive the guest's car away. This experience was really bad.

msg:After the Marriott gold card member asked the front desk if it was possible to upgrade the room, the answer was that it is not fully booked today, which is understandable. Although Ctrip shows that there are rooms available, but asked whether the gold card check-out is at two o'clock? The answer is still negative, and I only asked my card number when I persisted. Is this standard not uniform in your Marriott? In addition, is the member's mobile phone number not associated with the card number? There is still a deposit required, right? It is understandable that there are so many people after the epidemic is released. There is a queue for the breakfast buffet and a queue for check-in, but the standards still have to be enforced, right? speechless
