Beautiful room in the best location for a good value. The staff were all so friendly and the housekeeping was very attentive to detail. It was a decent breakfast in the beautiful open lobby. The pool and gym were both closed which upsets me that they don't mention that on trip.com before booking. I don't know if that is the hotel or website's fault but it's not cool to sell a hotel with a pool and then it's closed. In the future if we don't need a pool we will 100% stay here again!

When we arrived, the hotel asked us to have the nucleic test so we had to go to the nearest hospital and do it. After that, we were able to check in.
The hotel staffs are so accomodating and can speak English. The hotel is clean and convenient coz it is near the shopping malls. We had the most wonderful time there and we would love to go back and book in the same hotel again next time. 

Highly recommended to travellers.

The room is relatively small, which is incomparable with today's perspective, but it retains the soft power of the old five-star hotel. It is naturally clean and tidy, and the attentive service warms people's hearts! Checking in to the hotel can give people a sense of relaxation and comfort. After returning to the room after the scenic spot, I saw the room supervisor folded cute bunnies and Pleasant Goat with towels, and I was instantly exhausted. At breakfast, the hotel gave an extra exquisite dessert every day. The "Yuhua Stone Tangyuan" on the first day surprised me the most 😍 In addition, as many people mentioned, the Internet celebrity toilets at the Deji Plaza are close at hand. Not only Deji, but there are too many large shopping malls in Xinjiekou, and dining is also super convenient.

After comparing various hotels online, I finally chose Nanjing Central Hotel because the hotel is close to Deji Plaza and has a good location. It is just opposite the shopping mall, very close to the Presidential Palace, and also very close to Confucius Temple and Qinhuai River. Anyway, it is very convenient for travel. When booking a room, I specifically asked the hotel to upgrade it. Unexpectedly, Manager Gu at the front desk arranged a room upgrade for me. For a mother with a baby, it was really awesome. Fruits were prepared in the room. The room was very large. I was very satisfied with the warm service of the floor butler. 👍😄 I will choose this hotel again when I go to Nanjing next time. 🏨

msg:Taking my mother to Nanjing to find the memories of her youth, considering the convenience and comfort of travel, I compared for a long time online and booked this old five-star hotel located in Xinjiekou. It is about five minutes walk from Xinjiekou subway station.
We arrived at about nine o'clock in the evening. The room type booked when checking in was already very tight. For my special request (for the convenience of my mother), the star hotel standard reflected in the service of the front desk staff made me feel at ease, and we were lucky to meet Mr. Hao of the hotel on duty. Seeing that my mother was old, Mr. Hao was very enthusiastic to upgrade the room for us and personally took us to confirm the comfort of the room. In the whole process of selecting and checking in, Mr. Hao and the floor supervisor Wang made us feel very warm with their warm and thoughtful service, and finally selected a room suitable for my mother. The room is spacious and bright, well ventilated, clean and hygienic, with complete supplies and facilities. My mother is very satisfied. And such warm service has not stopped. During the seven days and six nights we stayed, we often received Mr. Hao's caring inquiries. When I had travel questions, I also received Mr. Hao's pertinent advice and help. Every day when I returned to the hotel, Butler Kou had cleaned and tidied the room for us, replenished the consumables, and gave us a very cute night bed gift. Seeing such a lovely service, I felt relaxed and happy after a tiring day.
The hotel is in an excellent location and is very convenient for travel. Many famous attractions are only two or three subway stops away. Food streets such as Mingwalang and Kexiang can be reached in twenty minutes. If you don't want to walk, there are famous food stalls upstairs in the Friendship Square next to it, so you don't have to go to the scenic spot to squeeze. The hotel is located in the core area of ​​Nanjing, opposite Deji Square, and nearby Nanjing Xinbai, Friendship Square and Nanjing World Trade Center. The underground passages of the subway station are well connected. In the evening, you can take a walk to visit the 12 million Internet celebrity toilets in Deji Square, or go to Xinbai. This trip to Nanjing was therefore very comfortable and relaxing. My mother was very happy. One day she even walked with me to the Gulou Campus of Nanjing University for a walk. It was so convenient, hahahahahahaha.
I have worked in a five-star hotel myself. High-star hotels emphasize satisfactory and surprising services, and I feel that here. Thank you Mr. Hao, Manager Wang, Butler Kou, and other hotel staff for allowing my mother and I to have a good rest during our trip to Nanjing. I wish you all the best in your work! The hotel business is booming!

msg:In terms of location, it is quite good. It is opposite Deji Square and a few steps away from the prosperous Xinjiekou. In terms of facilities, it is still a little short of the five-star level, probably because of its age. The room is actually very small, and can only fit a bed and a corner sofa. There is no place to put an extra bed, which makes it difficult for a family of three to stay. This time I stayed in a room facing the interior of the hotel. The sound insulation is pretty good, not as noisy as imagined. Standing on the balcony, you can see the interior of the lobby. It feels like you are on a cruise ship, and it is also quite European. The only shortcoming is that the room price exceeds the value of the room itself, probably because of the May Day holiday.

Every day when we returned to the hotel, the service staff folded small animals with towels, which made the children very happy. The breakfast variety is also very rich and the taste is very good. The location is excellent, just opposite Deji Square, which is just a step away. It is also very close to other attractions. Next time I have the opportunity to come to Nanjing, I will definitely choose this hotel again.

The room is not very large, but it is understandable in this location where every inch of land is valuable. There are too few towel racks in the room for drying clothes, so it is best to prepare travel hangers yourself. The non-smoking area is very quiet. The service staff is also very enthusiastic ❤️. The overall feeling is good, and I will consider recommending friends to stay here.

The lobby is decorated in style, the functional layout of the room is reasonable and comfortable, clean and hygienic, and the child fell asleep in seconds when lying on the bed.

The service is considerate, careful and attentive, the customer service feedback is fast, and the things you call for are delivered in a timely manner. I didn't even know the birthday on my ID card, and I was surprised to find a cake in the room after the trip.

It is very convenient to go to various attractions. Due to the late booking, I did not book a family room for the whole trip. I changed rooms once in the middle, from the 6th floor to the double room on the 5th floor. The housekeepers on both floors provided very good service. They responded very quickly after calling and provided help in time if needed. The breakfast was rich and tasted very good. There were various Nanjing-style snacks. During the festival, I also saw bumblebees in the hotel lobby, and I could take pictures and interact with them👍👍

First of all, the hotel has a great location, just opposite Deji Plaza; it is very convenient to go to the high-speed rail station, Xuanwu Lake, Confucius Temple and subway! Secondly, it has five-star service. Because I arrived late, I was directly upgraded to an executive suite. Manager Jiang sent me off, Xiao Xu who arranged the room service at the front desk, the floor waiter, and the lobby concierge were all very nice. It is worth going again!

msg:I brought four elderly people to Nanjing for a trip and planned to stay in Xinjiekou. After searching several hotels, this one had the highest rating. The actual stay experience was also very good. I recommend everyone to book it👍🏻

1. The hotel is located directly opposite the second phase of Deji. It is convenient to go shopping and eat as long as you cross a zebra crossing; there are also many 7-11 and breakfast shops around. After staying for three days, the elderly got up early and strolled out to eat breakfast, bought snacks, and then wandered back. If you take the subway, the train station goes directly to Xinjiekou. From Exit 6, walk straight for six or seven minutes to the hotel. Guests who drive themselves can also park (but the parking lot is not very large). I have to praise Nanjing's subway and taxis. Compared with other cities, they are extremely convenient and cheap.

2. Although the hotel is a bit old, the main facilities should have been renovated. The room is not particularly large, but the floor-to-ceiling windows have good light and the street view is also good. It is OK for two people to live in and will not feel cramped, but if you are a family of three, don't expect to add a bed. The room is clean and tidy, the toilet and bathroom are separated into dry and wet areas, and the water pressure for showering is sufficient; the lighting and air conditioning are controlled by electronic screens, there is a socket at the head of the bed for charging, and the Internet speed is also good.

3. The best thing is the service attitude of the hotel. Every employee I met from the beginning of check-in was very enthusiastic. I lived on the 9th floor. There was a special supervisor and housekeeper on the floor. I added WeChat directly on the day of check-in. Even if I was outside, I could contact them on WeChat at any time if I had any questions or needed anything. There were fruits for free for the three nights of stay. I sprained my foot in the middle. The floor supervisor took the initiative to call to ask if I needed ice cubes and medicated oil, etc. The takeaway was also delivered directly to the room. The service was very considerate👍🏻

Before coming to Nanjing, I also looked at various places to stay. After comparison, I chose this place and booked a standard room. When I checked in at the hotel front desk, the executive vice president happened to be there. Seeing that it was my first time in Nanjing, he specially upgraded the room for me⊙ω⊙
When I went to the hotel, I habitually looked at bath products and other things. I found that the small items here were so complete. I had never seen bath salts in other hotels. There were also small items such as nail files and sewing kits. It was not the kind of very simple little paper. I just loved it.

The hotel has a strong sense of service as a whole, and the service is proactive. The doorman took the initiative to help us carry the luggage from the car to the room; the front desk prepared brochures for guests, introducing food, drink and entertainment in Nanjing, and helped us extend the check-out time to more than 2 pm; several service staff in the guest room reminded the elderly to pay attention to safety when checking in, and found a bathroom anti-slip mat, laid a towel on the bathroom floor to prevent slipping, and promptly asked if they needed other help, especially Xiao Xiong. When the elderly wanted to find a chair to take a bath, she looked for it in many ways and finally found a chair, solving the elderly's worries about taking a bath. Thanks to the hotel's service staff, we spent two nights of a pleasant journey. Next time I come to Nanjing, I will still choose to stay at the Center Hotel.

After learning from Jinling Hotel, we could have stayed in Jinling for the last night, but we discussed and decisively chose the Central Hotel, mainly based on the hotel's reputation. The result was worth the trip. The hotel's General Manager Hao and the front office manager Gu, the professional hotel image and management ability made us admire. Whether it is the guest room, breakfast or concierge, the hotel makes us feel warm everywhere. The most worth mentioning is that the mattress is very comfortable, so I opened it and looked at it and wanted to change it when I got home. The room manager is amiable, and there is also a thin and tall very beautiful room lady whose name is unknown. Before leaving, she gave us items for the road, which was very heartwarming. In short, I must stay in the center next time I come.

I couldn't accompany them because of work, but the Central Hotel made them feel the warmth of home. The housekeeper gave them a little rabbit folded with towels and a handwritten note, which surprised them and made them feel warm. If they had any needs, the housekeeper would immediately provide help. It was really thoughtful. Every morning at breakfast, the manager also gave them local snacks in Nanjing, such as Yuhua Stone Tangyuan, etc., and would also ask if they were comfortable, which touched the elders. The breakfast was even better. Chinese and Western food were simply too much to eat. My mother liked Western food very much, which satisfied her taste buds. The hotel decoration is very special, with a Mediterranean Bohemian style. The design of the small balcony is very similar to a luxury cruise ship. The location is even better. It is very close to everywhere and very convenient. There are many dining options nearby. If I can give 10 stars, I will definitely give 10 stars! I will stay in this hotel every time I go to Nanjing in the future, and I also recommend all my friends who go to Nanjing to stay in this hotel! Look no further. This is the only hotel you will want to stay in Nanjing!

Special thanks to Manager Jiang, Butler Fang, Xiao Dong and Master Zhang. It was already past 9 o'clock in the evening when we drove from Tianjin to Nanjing. Manager Jiang upgraded the room. Thank you very much! The room was very large and clean. The next morning, Manager Jiang would remind us to have a meal and arrange for Xiao Dong to deliver the special breakfast Yuhua Tangyuan. There were different surprises on the third and fourth days, from Yuhua Tangyuan to sesame cakes to papaya stewed snow pear and white fungus soup, and then to oa**eal. Every morning, Manager Jiang would carefully arrange different special snacks. The five-star index was not enough to reflect this kind of thoughtful and considerate service! However, the hotel's thoughtful service did not stop there. Butler Fang, who was received on the floor, would meet our needs in time and also sent fruit. Master Zhang in the parking lot also helped us clean the car. This is an experience that we have never encountered in other hotels before. He even provided car cleaning services. It was so thoughtful! 
A lot of snacks were given when we checked out. Manager Jiang also arranged a small gift "Chinese knot" to wish us good luck and peace. It was really warm! 
I love traveling. I have been to too many places and stayed in too many hotels. I have many beautiful and warm memories, but the service of Nanjing Hotel this time refreshed my beautiful record. The whole service has no dead ends, and it is enthusiastic, caring, thoughtful and warm! 
Come to Nanjing again, this must be my only choice, because it tastes like home!

The housekeeper was super nice and enthusiastic. She provided us with a fruit plate for free and introduced the room and balcony. Looking down, you can see the hotel restaurant, which is very beautiful and has a rich breakfast. We were a little pressed for time and didn't have time to eat much else. In addition, the location is very convenient, opposite Deji and Jiebai, which is very convenient for eating and shopping.

The hotel is very large, located in a semicircle on a street corner, with a unique cave inside. The room is warm, free fruits are provided every day, it is not cold at all, and the air conditioner can be turned off at night to avoid being too dry. The bed pillows are medium-sized and the sound insulation is very good. The breakfast buffet is great! Complimentary Yuhua stone glutinous rice balls and papaya stewed snow clam. There are young people and older people among the hotel service staff, and I can see the corporate culture of caring for old employees.
Opposite Deji, it is convenient for eating, and Deji also has Hualian. There are several big shopping malls around. If you go out and take a taxi, you'll usually be there within a minute. It is close to the Xinjiekou subway station. It is recommended to take Exit 6. Exit 20 leads to the back alley of the hotel.

After doing a lot of research, I chose the Nanjing Central Hotel, which is quiet in the bustle. It is located in the Xinjiekou business district, opposite Deji Plaza, and closest to Exits 20 and 6 of the Xinjiekou Subway Station.

As soon as you entered the hotel, you felt the attentive, polite and warm service. Xiao Xu at the front desk helped us check in and arranged all of us on the same floor.

Although the room is a bit small, it is very clean and has everything. I still remember the manager’s name is Hao Jian, which reminds me of the Hao Jian played by Shen Teng. Manager Hao enthusiastically introduced us to various delicious and fun places around the hotel.

The hotel staff really take good care of guests with children, like family. I actually found that Aunt Xie and Aunt Ding helped me wash mine and my children's dirty socks. This is something I have never encountered before.

"In the restaurant, you can not only encounter food, but also love." MM Xiaodong in the buffet area brought the special Yuhuashi glutinous rice balls to her children. Although it was cold outside, she felt warm in her heart.

We were going to Zhongshan Scenic Area early in the morning on the day of check-out. Butler Jia told me to play without any worries, but if I was in a hurry, she would extend my check-out time by a few hours...
In this hotel, I feel the kindness of the staff towards children and the considerate care for guests everywhere. Recommended!

The service is great👍🏻. First of all, we upgraded to a double bed room. When checking in, the front desk asked for a quieter room, so we gave it to a room on a high floor, close to the hotel. Mr. Hao personally took it up. When we checked in, we found that the room opposite was facing Deji. So I chose one near the back and one near the interior of the hotel. There are arrangements to deliver fruits every day, which is great. When I took a shower on the first day, I found that the water was not very hot, so I mentioned it to the housekeeper. When I took a shower on the second day, the water temperature was raised. It was very comfortable, and there was also a bathtub for soaking. The hotel's breakfast is also great, with many varieties, including Nanjing's special duck blood vermicelli soup, soup wontons, Meiling porridge, egg pancakes, as well as Western-style croissants, salads, coffee... Summary: As a 5-star hotel, this service is absolutely The scale is over 5⭐, but due to the construction area, each room is indeed a bit small, but their service definitely makes up for this.

Butler Fang provided enthusiastic service and thoughtfully prepared disposable bath covers, bath salts, and toilets for the children. Covers and towels, check-in gifts were prepared, and a farewell gift was specially given to the children before leaving. I would like to express my gratitude to Mr. Hao and Butler Fang. When I go back, I will recommend friends who come to Nanjing to stay here.

The hotel's hygiene is very meticulous, making it comfortable for children with allergies. The location is good, only a 5-minute walk from Xinjiekou subway station. There are plenty of snacks and restaurants nearby, making it a favorite among foodies. If you get sick, Jiangsu Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine is a 10-minute walk away. When traveling, staying in a hotel in a good location can avoid wasting time in transportation. I recommend friends who come to Nanjing to stay at the Central Hotel.

msg:After reading various reviews online, I felt very uneasy. I was afraid of making the wrong choice, but it turned out that I made a good choice? After landing in Nanjing, I took a taxi to the hotel at about 11:30. A gentleman named Liu Yu picked me up. After checking the information, he helped me arrange a room. I tried to ask if I could upgrade, and he arranged it for me very happily. I booked a newly renovated room and was told that the room would be larger than what I had booked before. And tell me which way is more convenient to take the elevator. You need to swipe your card to use the elevator, which is very reassuring. My floor is not high and it is on the same floor as the restaurant, which is very convenient. After entering the room, it is clean and tidy. There is also a refrigerator and free drinking water. If it is not enough, call the staff and the staff will bring it to you. The bath water is very large, which is very refreshing, and the drainage facilities in the bathroom are normal and there will be no accumulation of water. The quality of the toiletries prepared in the bathroom is also very good. The air conditioner cools quickly enough and the noise is acceptable. My room faced the street, but it was not noisy. The soundproofing effect of the room was average, and the sound in the corridor could be heard. This was acceptable. There is a chaise lounge, which is very comfortable and comes with four pillows, which is definitely enough for me. The room uses a Xiaomi TV, with free channels to watch, and the remote control is easy to operate. The bed is big enough, with moderate firmness and softness, allowing me to sleep peacefully until dawn. The room includes breakfast, and there are many diners. I feel more at ease when I see many international friends dining together. After all, it is an old five-star hotel. There are freshly cooked wontons, noodles, duck blood vermicelli soup, various Western breads, and vegetables. Salads, Chinese pastries, hot dishes, cold dishes, yogurt, coffee, porridge, and juices are all available. I am dazzled. I ate two bowls of duck blood and vermicelli soup. It tasted really delicious, better than those in a certain Internet celebrity store. Because it was an early flight, I checked out after breakfast. I just handed over the room card directly. There was no deposit or request for positive reviews. It was really good. I enjoyed my two-night stay this time. I will come back next time. of.

msg:When I came to Nanjing this time, I really experienced how comfortable it is to live well. As a long-established five-star hotel, the Central Hotel can be said to occupy the best corner of Xinjiekou, and the downstairs is NIO’s Cow House. As a car owner, I felt very cordial, and I even went for a spin. When I checked in at the front desk, I really felt what it means to feel at home. The lobby manager and all service staff were very enthusiastic and thoughtful, valet parking, help with luggage, upgrade rooms, and recommend itineraries. Although the facilities and environment may be a bit old, the room is clean and tidy, especially the bathing system is very comfortable. This conditioner is the best I have ever used 😂 I want to buy some back. Finally, I would like to praise the exclusive butler service. He responded to everything and the service was very considerate. The only drawback is that the air conditioning system may be a bit old and the heating power is not enough. It feels a little chilly in the morning. I hope it can be improved.

msg:The two previous business trips were just transiting through Nanjing. This time, I finally had three days to stay in Nanjing and walk around. In fact, staying at the Central Hotel was also a temporary decision, but the three-night experience was very satisfactory and surprising. As an old five-star hotel in Nanjing, the hardware may not look as luxurious as the newly opened hotels, but the hotel's daily room service, catering, and communication with guests all reflect the high standards of five-star hotels.
First of all, the hotel has a superior geographical location, Xinjiekou business district, close to the subway station, and the surrounding Xinbai, Deji, Golden Eagle, and Presidential Palace can all be reached on foot, making travel very convenient.
When I checked in, there was a little problem with my room, and the housekeeper quickly solved it and helped me carry my luggage from the fifth floor to the sixth floor. The room was cleaned every day, and fruits were given. The restaurant breakfast and dinner buffet were very good, salted duck, duck blood vermicelli soup, desserts, and surprise Yuhua stone dumplings were all made by the hotel itself, which tasted better than those in restaurants outside. Finally, I would like to thank Mr. Hao, housekeeper Fang and housekeeper Lu on the fifth and sixth floors, and the restaurant foreman Manager Dong. Next time I come to Nanjing, I will choose the Central Hotel again.

The service provided by Room Butler Wang and Butler Zhang is also quite excellent!
It is recommended that everyone choose Nanjing Central Hotel with confidence when visiting Nanjing. Because, this hotel will never let you down.

The hygiene of the guest rooms is also impeccable, and the sheets and quilt covers are clean and tidy.
Moreover, the hotel also arranged a free upgrade for me, which was really a surprise!

I was really warmed up by Nanjing’s food early in the morning. The lobby of the breakfast room is also beautiful. The five-story-high space is very similar to a foreign cruise ship, and it is grand and luxurious.
The manager of the floor was very considerate. Latex pillows, eye masks and earplugs were thoughtfully delivered to the room. Xiaoxia specially served Yuhua glutinous rice balls for us for breakfast, which were very similar to Yuhua stones. The sesame-filled glutinous rice balls also tasted great!
I made an appoin**ent with my client at Deji across the street at noon, just across the road. The traffic is really convenient.
I will stay here again next time I come to Nanjing. The hotel gave me a perfect experience. Nanjing’s food and beautiful scenery are worthy of five-star praise🌟and strong recommendation👏

msg:Overall pretty good. The location should be convenient, next to Deji Plaza. The hotel should have been renovated. Although the entrance feels a bit small and the parking lot is crowded, it is still good to go inside the hotel. It has a cruise ship feel, and the restaurant can be seen from the windowsill of some rooms. The Lijing twin room I booked is very similar to the basic guest room on a cruise ship. The room is not big and the bathroom is separated from wet and dry.
The service is commendable and enthusiastic, the floor butler is very good, and the breakfast waiter Xiaoxia is also very good. There are many choices for breakfast, and the taste is good. There are also special Yuhua glutinous rice balls, salted duck, and duck blood vermicelli soup.
When we checked in, the front desk learned that we were traveling and proactively provided a brochure introducing the attractions, which was very considerate.

msg:I came to Nanjing to visit Nanjing during the National Day. It took me a long time to choose a hotel. Since I was traveling on my own, I wanted to choose a better location that would be convenient to various attractions. I finally decided on this hotel. I thought the price/performance ratio was good. It’s a central location, a five-star hotel, and holiday prices. It is considered a lower one among the same level. I didn’t have high expectations at first, but I was quite surprised when I arrived. First of all, the location is good, surrounded by business districts, very lively, and close to the Xinjiekou subway. It is a 5-minute walk from the station. It is convenient to reach various attractions. The service is also good. I would like to praise Xiao Chen at the front desk and manager Lu on the floor. We stayed for 3 days and received fruits and drinks twice, and also folded a small bag every day. The animals were given to us with great care, and the children liked them very much. In addition, special praise should be given to the hotel breakfast, which is very rich and includes most of Nanjing's specialties. The Yuhua Stone Tangyuan is a specialty of the hotel. You can also try it. We got up early in the morning. It was quite late. Every time I went to the restaurant, there were no vacancies. I had to go upstairs. However, it was inconvenient to get food upstairs. The waiter Xiao Dong was very enthusiastic to help us find a seat every time and notified us as soon as there were vacancies. Overall, this It was quite a comfortable stay this time. I will consider their home next time I come to Nanjing.

msg:I lived in South Center for several winters several years ago.
It looks inconspicuous from the outside, even when you enter the house, but by chance you open the interior balcony, and the warmth and romance at that moment is astonishing. Great memories over the years.

In the blink of an eye, I haven’t been to Nanjing for many years. I have been visiting Nanjing frequently recently because of performances.
The main theme is a sentimental card, so I booked it again. It was said to have been renovated, but I didn't see any big changes.

I originally booked a twin room, but it was only on the lower floor. There was almost no balcony view that I liked, so I had to upgrade to a high floor.
I would like to thank the service staff at the center for the free upgrade. Although there is only one bed, it is still a lot of inconvenience. But fortunately that familiar feeling is back.

Although the room is small, the design is exquisite. Dojo inside the snail shell. But what I want to comment on is that I don’t understand why the shower room is semi-enclosed. I can’t remember if it became like this after renovation. The shower water will splash out, which is not very convenient.

Another point is that I don't understand why the upper floors can't arrange some twin rooms. There is absolutely no need for an all-white bed. Customers with various needs should be able to relax and listen to piano music on the balcony of a high-rise hotel~￼

The breakfast waiter specially arranged Yuhua Stone Rice Balls. It tastes good and looks better than buying from outside.

It was still early to check out on the last day, so I took a rest and lay down for a while. The perspective is shown in Figure 5. I listened to music and crossed my feet, and my thoughts were endless. The piano music lingering downstairs is Winter Love.

First of all, it is a 5-6 minute walk from Xinjiekou Subway Station, across the road from Deji Square, and the location is very convenient for transportation. It is very convenient to go to every scenic spot and train station by public transportation!
Secondly, the service of the hotel makes people feel at home. Because I am staying with a one-and-a-half-year-old baby, I made a note of the hygiene requirements of the room when I booked the room. After checking the cleanliness of the room, we arrived at 11:00 in the morning and checked in early. After arriving at the room, the floor manager Lu took the initiative to greet and greet the room. He also gave a fruit platter and drinks as a gift, which was very considerate.
Besides, the buffet breakfast, the hotel's buffet breakfast can taste Nanjing's authentic salted duck, special Yuhua glutinous rice balls, delicious duck blood vermicelli soup, many types, delicious, thanks to the restaurant manager Xiaodong for his thoughtful service.
Then, the decoration of the hotel is the aesthetics of an old five-star hotel. The lobby is magnificent and hygienic. Although the hotel's sanitary showers are not together, the design is reasonable on the left and right sides of the entrance, and the facilities in the room are complete.
Finally, I would like to thank the hotel again for your thoughtful and considerate service. Although I stayed overnight, I feel great. It will still be the best choice when I come to Nanjing next time!

msg:An old-fashioned hotel in the center of Nanjing. It is very close to the subway station and walks for 5 or 6 minutes. Deji Plaza is across the road. It is very convenient for shopping and eating. The hotel is very user-friendly because I originally wanted to store my luggage when I arrived early. I just wanted to try it out. I thought about asking the guy at the front desk if he could check in. I didn't expect to agree directly and help to upgrade the room. The most surprising thing is that the housekeeper in the room warmly delivered mineral water and drinks. Thank you very much. Although the room is not big, the facilities are quite good The old sound insulation effect is not very good, but fortunately it is clean and there is a small
It's also good to be able to go out on the balcony to see the hotel's garden view. Overall, the stay experience is not bad.

The lady was very nice. Later, I added the hotel WeChat, because there are many things such as luggage, computer, etc., I just tried to say that if there is a luggage area, it would be great. Mr. Hao really changed us to a bigger room for free. Later, my friend who was traveling with me had worn out his foot, and he also sent him a Band-Aid. Drinking water was also generously provided, and a towel bunny was folded, so cute.
Facilities: The interior room at the beginning had a small balcony facing the European-style hall, but the later suite has two bathrooms, a desk, a refrigerator, and a cloakroom (luggage area), with ample space.
Environment: The location is very convenient, not far from the subway station, surrounded by shopping malls, and it is also very convenient to go to Meiyuan for dinner. You can order grandma’s handmade drinks on the mini program and then go out to get them; go a little further away by subway and Taxi is ok. It is convenient to go to Kexiang, 1912, Art Museum, Xiaoxi Lake, and Yihe Road.

Hygiene: I changed the room temporarily, and the new room has a little hygiene problem, but I told Mr. Hao that I got feedback immediately, and there is no discomfort.
This time, I chose it again because my friends who were traveling with me had lived here before. This time, I have also given Amway to my friends around me, and I will consider staying again for family trips in the future. Thanks again to Manager Zhou of the main station, Manager Wang and Butler Zhang for their services, and Manager Hao Jian.

I left in a hurry and forgot to take a photo. The hotel is surprisingly good. First of all, the service attitude is very good. The security guard even carried the suitcase for me. The front desk service attitude is also very good, especially Xiao Xu, who also helped upgrade the parent-child room , I found a quiet room and lived very comfortably. When entering the hotel, the environment is the same as the photos, clean and well designed. The weather was hot, and Manager Dai, the general manager of the floor, and Zhou Guiping, the housekeeper, helped to arrange for drinking water, and also helped to arrange for cleaning of clothes, and left a note, which was very considerate. The breakfast variety is very rich, especially thanks to Xiao Dong, who sent Yuhua glutinous rice balls, and the service is satisfactory. It's very convenient to travel. It's next to Deji Square. It's only a few minutes to the bustling Xinjiekou subway. I'll stay here again next time. I'd like to thank General Manager Hao for his meticulous care. All in all, a very satisfying accommodation experience.

The hotel is opposite Deji Plaza, adjacent to Jinling Hotel, and it takes only 5 minutes to walk to Exit 6 of Xinjiekou Metro Station. When you enter the hotel, the doorman will help you with your luggage, guide you to check in and help me upgrade the room type, and someone will take you to the room. When I entered the room, the air conditioner was turned on, and the cool feeling was really comfortable. Just as I put down my luggage, the waiter brought mineral water. But when I returned to the hotel at 10 o'clock on the second day of check-in, I encountered a small episode. Immediately after contacting the service housekeeper, a young lady surnamed Wang came to the room to help solve the problem, and brought a fruit plate with a very sincere attitude. Here I would like to express my thanks again to this young lady! Also, the small balcony in the room is very distinctive, the scenery is beautiful and the sound insulation effect is very good. Next time I come to Nanjing, I will choose the Central Hotel^^

It is only about 10 minutes walk from Exit 6 of Xinjiekou Station on Metro Line 1 and Line 2. Surrounded by major shopping malls in the Xinjiekou business district, it is very convenient for shopping and dining. The hotel rooms are clean and tidy, the restaurant in the lobby is fresh and elegant, the front desk staff are enthusiastic when checking in, and the breakfast variety is rich. The director of the restaurant is thoughtful and considerate. Upon check-in, the guest room provided welcome fruit and drinks. Since I was not used to using shower gel and wanted to ask for an extra piece of soap, I did not expect the floor manager Lu to deliver it to the door in person and asked if there was any other needs, which was heartwarming. The quality of the hotel staff is high, and the service makes people feel warm. It is worthy of being an old five-star hotel!

Although it is a 30-year-old hotel, it is gorgeous and exquisite everywhere. The decoration style can be seen that it has been used for some time, but the classic design can stand the test of time. It is still good after 30 years. I like the design of each room in the hotel. You can look at the public hall through the balcony.
In addition to the good hardware facilities, the hotel also provides excellent service. When checking in, Ms. Yang at the front desk helped me check in. After knowing that I was here for a meeting, she thoughtfully arranged the room for me on the same floor as the meeting room. In fact, this move greatly facilitated my work and allowed me to attend the meeting with ease. The housekeeper on the floor, Ms. Xie, brought me fruit. The breakfast the next day was also very delicious. Come on, I almost missed the deliciousness.
In fact, when I came to Nanjing, I still had a cold and my health was not very good. Because of the hotel's good environment and considerate service, I was tired. I will bring my family to stay next time. Because the hotel is located near Deji Square, the transportation is also very convenient, and it is very convenient for eating and shopping. I hope the hotel will have a parent-child room, which is suitable for a family of three.

The disadvantage is that the room is old. Although it is spacious, the facilities are old and simple. There are no bright spots.

For us, one of the most important parts of going out is to live ~ so we basically search for five-star hotels first, then look at the location, then read the reviews, and then look at the price-performance ratio haha! I stayed in another five-star hotel in Xinjiekou five years ago. Apart from the good location, I don’t have much impression. This time, Nanjing Center Hotel left us with a deep impression and a small surprise. Because it is an old hotel, the overall scale and room type are not big, but it is neat and clean, the bedding is comfortable and soft, and there are fruits and souvenirs as gifts. The customer service even made a baby elephant for the child, which surprised him very much! The breakfast is also very good. There are all kinds of Nanjing delicacies you want to eat. There is also a special gift of Yuhuashi glutinous rice balls. The most distinctive thing is that the atrium of the breakfast is very beautiful, and the food is really enjoyable. It is recommended to have breakfast. The important thing is to make a reservation Breakfast is not expensive! The location is also good, 200-300 meters away from Xinjiekou Subway Station, it is very convenient to go anywhere.
The most satisfying thing is the service. The reception manager Lu and the customer service manager Xiao Jiang have been following up the considerate service for the past few days... On the last day when I went to Niu Shou Mountain, the traffic was more than expected and the trip was delayed. Manager Gu at the front desk was very enthusiastic to help delay the trip. When checking out... The children said that they were reluctant to leave the Central Hotel when they checked out! It is really a five-star hotel with high cost performance. great!

Parking by yourself is a problem. You can park your car at the hotel. The hotel parking is free. It is still recommended to take a taxi in summer. You can locate the lobby of the central hotel and wait in the lobby with air conditioning. You must walk when you take the subway out of the subway, but Nanjing is too hot in summer. You will sweat after walking a few steps. It is still recommended to take a point-to-point taxi.

It is also very close to the subway station and convenient for travel. The room is clean and tidy, and the quilt and pillows are very comfortable. The service at the hotel was great, all the staff were very welcoming and provided a meet and greet. The breakfast is very good, with many varieties, good taste and very cost-effective. Thanks to Manager Bai Tian for the reception, and Xiao Dong from the breakfast room for sending Yuhua glutinous rice balls and duck blood vermicelli soup, which are delicious. Xiao Ke in the parking lot washed the car for free. Very good staying experience. Next time I come to Nanjing, I will choose Central Hotel.

After exiting the station, exit from Phase II B1 of Deji Plaza and cross the road to the hotel. You can reach various scenic spots in Nanjing. Very convenient. The room size is small, but the layout is reasonable, the facilities are convenient to use, the sanitation is very good, the breakfast is also very rich, and the Yuhuashi glutinous rice balls are very special. The hotel has a high sense of service, especially Manager Hao, who is very considerate, and Xiao Xu at the front desk, butler Lu on the floor, and Xiao Dong for breakfast.

However, there is a large gap in the door, and no soundproof tape is attached. The noise from the aisle outside is completely unblocked, making it difficult to sleep.
Then early in the morning, the buffet breakfast room began to ping-pong-pong to prepare tableware, pour ice cubes, and was woken up directly.
Basic sleep and rest needs cannot be met, and I will not stay again next time.

As soon as I arrived at the hotel lobby, there was a warm reception. It happened that the team checked in and thought it would take a long time. The waiter in the lobby brought us water. I contacted the front desk to help us handle it as soon as possible and upgraded the room type. Let us quickly enter the room to rest, very satisfied! The breakfast on the second day was also very rich, not only Chinese and Western styles, but also Nanjing special small wonton stew and duck blood vermicelli, which tasted very good! During breakfast, Manager Hao asked us about our stay experience with concern. The service was very good and we continued to stay decisively. The location of the hotel is very good. It is opposite to Deji Square. It is very convenient to travel. After going out for a day and returning to the room, the room is not only clean, but also the little doll given to the child by the butler Kou is very heartwarming. Thank you very much for the fruit delivered by Manager Wang. The little card in the lobby is very cute for the children. Xiaoxia Yuhua specially prepared Yuhua glutinous rice balls service! Raised needs and problems are also quickly resolved. The service of the whole team is very good, professional, enthusiastic, meticulous and thoughtful! Let us have a better travel experience during this trip, thanks again to the staff of Central Hotel!

Why did my title use the ceiling where the loot is stored? Because this central hotel is right in the center of Xinjiekou, Nanjing. Exit 6 of Xinjiekou Subway Station can be reached in about three minutes on foot. The nearby shopping mall is the representative of Nanjing’s purchases. There is no one. If you go out When shopping, you don’t need to think about it, you don’t need to use a map, you don’t have to worry about getting lost, you only worry about getting lost in shopping for pleasure, because there are too many things to buy, and all middle and high-end products are available. When you are too tired from shopping or hold too many trophies, Go back to the hotel and put it in the room, then take a short rest, and then go out to fight in the business district, it is just a matter of close at hand, so isn't this hotel a ceiling for storing trophies?

In addition to the excellent location of the hotel, the guest rooms are also very comfortable. The softness of the sleeping bed is very suitable for the requirements of Asians. The sense of space is very high, and the bathroom facilities are complete, especially the shower. The spraying speed is like a massage, which really helps to relieve physical and mental fatigue.

The original price of breakfast in the hotel is 100 yuan per person. If you are a guest, you can reduce it to 50 yuan per person. I suggest that everyone, don’t forget to tell the hotel, reserve a seat for breakfast in the morning, because it is too rich, Chinese and Western dishes Both (I just took a picture of a small part of the breakfast dishes), the restaurant is indoors, but the design is open-air, it feels like having breakfast in a resort hotel, wow! It's just a 50 yuan breakfast, and it's so blissful to have such enjoyment.
In particular, there is a famous Nanjing dish for breakfast...salted duck, which tastes fragrant and tender. I love salted duck so much that I ate two plates in one sitting.

This hotel is a five-star hotel, but I think the service attitude of the hotel is seven-star. From Manager Gu at the front desk of the hotel to Ms. Xie, the housekeeper of the hotel room service, the service is very good. They know that when I stayed in Nanjing, it was just For the wedding anniversary, I specially folded a warm little swan and put it on the bed, it was so touching. Manager Gu introduced the restaurants or snack streets of the local people more carefully, so that I can go to some non-tourist restaurants, and then I can deeply understand the living habits of the local people. This is important information for me. , because I don't think much about the restaurants that these tourists frequent. These restaurants are not bad, but they don't have enough local experience.

All in all, the Central Hotel can be described by the horoscope, with the right time, place and people.

Central Hotel Address: Xinjiekou area (Exit 6 of Xinjiekou Subway Station)

I decided to book two rooms. The location is very good, and it is convenient to travel. The opposite is Deji Square. After checking in Butler Pan sent some supplies, and also added Manager Lu’s service WeChat. It’s really convenient if you need service. Butler Xie and Manager Wang also sent fruits, and the breakfast is also very satisfactory. Mr. Hao and the restaurant’s Xiaodong also specially prepared Yuhua glutinous rice balls , It’s really beautiful, and I will stay in the center when I come to Nanjing in the future.

Center Hotel is located between Changjiang Road and Zhongshan Road, adjacent to Jinling Hotel and Deji Square. It is also a familiar place. Service is still a feature of the hotel. Rooms are average. The price of 500 yuan including breakfast is competitive in the core area of Xinjiekou. Benwei restaurant on the second floor tastes good, but the price is not cheap. The breakfast is rich and tastes good. Hope it gets better and better.

msg:This is the second time I have stayed in this hotel. The first thing I must confirm is that from the front desk to the room service, almost everyone has done a good job with a warm and friendly, customer-oriented concept, and will respond to and solve requests in a timely manner.

There are many dissatisfaction with the breakfast. There are few varieties, especially seasonal vegetables. We have been to Beijing not long ago. Logically speaking, there are not many varieties of vegetables in the north, but the hotel there is really good. There are many kinds of fried vegetables for breakfast available for everyone to choose,
Hope Nanjing Central Hotel can improve!

Finally, I want to complain about the male staff who checked out for me around 8:00 in the morning at 4.4 Nanjing Grand Hotel!

When I put the card in for him, I asked about the refund, and he replied clearly word by word: 100 yuan for breakfast will be refunded through WeChat, and the remaining 300 yuan will be refunded to my account from the platform.

And I added another sentence: it takes about 1-2 working days to arrive at the account.

At the same time, he handed me a list for me to sign, because he replied so carefully and in place, I had unlimited trust in the staff at that time, and signed without even reading it...

Unexpectedly, I signed a contract without any refund.
Fortunately, there is a chat record between the foreman of the room depar**ent and me the day before. The content includes the settlement of 650 yuan per night and 550 yuan for the last night. Otherwise, it would be difficult for Ctrip to help me solve this matter and judge it. Thank you Ctrip !

At the same time, I also despise the gentleman at the front desk who checks out for me:

What I want to tell you is: a big man, especially the staff in the service industry, you not only represent your hotel, but also the image of the entire tourism industry,
Just a few words, what you said on the front foot, but you vehemently denied what you said on the back foot shocked me! In fact, you can apologize to me. If you make a mistake or you are not familiar with the business, you can be understood and forgiven.

But I just can't tolerate denying it. Who of us didn't make a mistake or say a mistake?

But I really look down on this kind of behavior of a big man who talks about Lai. I originally had a very good impression of the hotel you are in, but it has been wiped out by your vulgar villain behavior!

I also hope that Nanjing Central Hotel will take this as a warning, and improve quality education among its hotel staff, so that they can remain invincible in the same industry!

I asked for a quiet room and she looked it up for a while, then told me she found the quietest room for me. ￼I thanked you very politely, went to the room and took a look￼, next to the first room in the corridor is the elevator room￼. I can hear everyone coming and going in the room clearly. I was really angry, I must have thanked her very politely at that time, she must have played me like a monkey. In the end, I dragged my luggage and went back to the front desk again, and found a male front desk to help me change the room.
The hotel room is extremely small, making people feel that the space is depressing and airtight. I have to open the balcony door at night or I can't breathe at all, and the cafeteria opposite the balcony has no privacy at all.
I took a special photo of the bathroom in the room. You can see how short the top of the bathroom is. It doesn't feel like 1.8 meters. It is recommended that boys should not choose it to stay.
Of course, it also has advantages. Firstly, its location is very good. Secondly, the breakfast in the restaurant has many varieties, delicious taste and warm and thoughtful service. But if I had to choose again, I would not choose to stay.

Mr. Hao took the initiative to arrange for us to change to a suite. Considering that we brought two children, he added a small bed for us in advance and sent us a fruit plate to express his apology. , The thoughtful service this time really surprised us 🤩, and it warmed my heart ~ The children were very happy ~ ❤️ I have to say that the hotel was chosen this time too ~ This service is really incomparable to other hotels in China No matter from Mr. Hao, the floor supervisor or the front desk staff, even the cleaning lady on the floor is warm and warm~ Next time I come to Nanjing, I will definitely choose this hotel again~😎

msg:Because I accompanied my daughter to participate in the interview training, I stayed at the Old Five-Star Central Hotel in Nanjing, so that the three of us had a very pleasant and very happy hotel stay experience for 5 days and 4 nights. First of all, the hotel is located in the busiest commercial area in Nanjing. The second phase of Deji is opposite the hotel's Dongmen Road. Golden Eagle, Cenbest, and Dayang Depar**ent Store are also a few hundred meters away, which is especially convenient for travel and shopping. Secondly, the hotel's parking lot is on the ground, directly parked in the hotel's yard, which is very convenient and fast. Master Wang in the parking lot will also wash our car clean. The most nice thing is the check-in experience: Manager Jiang in the lobby will deliver our luggage to the door of the room, and patiently teach us how to swipe the card in the elevator and at the door of the room. The service of Manager Zhou in the lobby also made all three of us like it--the little girl from Golden Eagle clothing delivered and picked up my clothes for me in a few days, and he arranged them properly without any complaints. The luckiest thing in the Central Hotel was to meet the foreman Dong in the restaurant. The exquisite breakfast and her sweet smile made us all feel like a spring breeze. She not only brought us the legendary Yuhuashi glutinous rice balls, but also papaya stewed snow clams and other exquisite dishes. She also took the initiative to call Manager Zhou in the lobby to help me solve some minor problems encountered in the accommodation, and it was because of her call that I met Manager Lu of the hotel's room depar**ent. Manager Lu's service is really considerate and meticulous. , not only helped us upgrade the room type for free, but also took the initiative to help us ask the hotel leader Mr. Hao to help us solve the breakfast problem. Thank you Mr. Hao for the delicious breakfast presented to us. The next day in the breakfast room, I met Mr. Hao with a smile on his face. He asked about our check-in experience and dining experience very carefully. At that time, I just casually said that the office pencil case in the hotel was a bit old. When we returned to the room after the meal, the cleaning lady came to change the pencil case. I really admire Mr. Hao's decisiveness and speed in handling things. Suddenly, I remembered a sentence for Mr. Hao: Be a Bodhisattva with a heart, and do things with lightning speed. Finally, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to Steward Wang who delivered the loving fruit platter and Steward Xie who delivered the safflower oil in time when my leg was sprained. Because of their family-like care, my leg recovered quickly. I am very lucky and grateful to have met so many caring people in Central Hotel! Because of your high-quality service, you have given us the warmth of home! So the three of us voted unanimously: we will stay at the Central Hotel when we come to Nanjing in the future, and we will recommend the Central Hotel to our relatives and friends!

msg:A hotel with very good service. As soon as you enter the door, the customer service manager will help you with your luggage and take it to check-in. Not only checked in early, but also upgraded the room.

  Generally speaking, the room is very clean, all facilities are good, and water and beverages, as well as disposable bathtub membranes are provided thoughtfully. The air conditioner is very hot. Because it is a central air conditioner, the switch in the room cannot actually adjust the temperature. It can only turn off the wind. Fortunately, the window in the room can be opened but I found out too late.

  There are many types of breakfast, and there is no problem with eating well.

  It is also very close to Xinjiekou Station of Line 1 and Line 2. If you want to take a taxi, you can go out from the west gate of the hotel. It is more convenient to hail a taxi at the entrance of Huarong Building.

  When I checked out, I happened to meet the deputy general manager. He also took the initiative to ask for opinions on check-in, and he cared about the customer's experience. and also gave a small gift

  The only regret is that the swimming pool is not open due to maintenance. Next time I have the opportunity to go to Nanjing, I will choose his place again.

It takes less than 30 taxis to Confucius Temple, the Museum, the Massacre Memorial Hall, and the Presidential Palace. The room is large and the hygiene is good. The breakfast is also rich. The salted duck is similar to the big stalls and is delicious. Manager Jiang Wei is very enthusiastic and answers all questions. He took the initiative to ask about the experience of staying. When I mentioned that the door gap was large and light came in, he immediately replied whether I needed to change rooms. His service concept 👍. He also gave the children a small gift before leaving.

First, the sanitation is not very good, and the bedside is covered with dust. (Picture 1, Picture 3) Second, the so-called family room I booked is A small bed was added beside the room wall, and the mattress of the small bed was as hard as a wooden board. The floors of the hotel are also very short. When you get out of the elevator from the lobby to the room, you will suddenly enter the Lilliputian Kingdom (Picture 2) and you will suddenly become taller and bigger.

After three years, I visited Nanjing with my family, Xuanwu Lake, Jiming Temple, Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum, Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum, Confucius Temple and Qinhuai style. Teammates commented: But that's it. Not everything is well-arranged, and it can be changed temporarily, just to get the profound meaning of tourism. ​I am very satisfied with the hotel I stayed in this time. It is located in the city center. Opposite the hotel is Deji Plaza, and the subway station is not far away. Especially Haidilao's service can be called the hotel class. I commend the manager on the floor. I give the child an extra bed for free, and Xiaoxia delivers breakfast The delicious Yuhua glutinous rice balls, the free car wash service provided by Mr. Cao, and the free fruits and thoughtful reminders we saw when we returned to the hotel at night made us feel that our trip was worthwhile. If I have the opportunity to go to Nanjing in the future, I will definitely choose Nanjing Central Hotel again.

msg:Came from Shanghai to Tangshan Zhongshan all the way into the urban area of Nanjing. I originally wanted to book the Jinling Hotel in Xinjiekou, but the room rate increased as it got closer... I accidentally found the Jinling Central Hotel a few steps away. I took a look. The price is not bad. I stayed in Nanjing for one night and booked a Lijing double bed room. I drove to the hotel at night and felt very considerate service. Vice President He at the front desk received us in person and saw that the three of us were a bit crowded and got a free upgrade. He also took us into the room and the floor Manager Wang brought us drinks and quilts. Thank you very much! The hotel is newly renovated from an old hotel. The balcony is an interior view and it is very quiet to sleep at night. I can't feel the hustle and bustle of vehicles on Zhongshan Road next to it. The location of the hotel is completely in line with expectations. The opposite is Deji Square. It is very convenient to get in and out, whether you take the subway or take a taxi to go to major attractions. What is especially surprising is the three-dimensional parking lot of the hotel. When I went downstairs to visit the Confucius Temple Lantern Festival, I saw my car was still on the ground I was a little surprised. I only found out that I washed my car after asking. It was the first time I felt such considerate service in the current hotel. Thanks again to Mr. Wang, the car washer. It can be seen that the hotel has put a lot of effort into the service, including the front desk, storage, and parking guidance. After staying in this hotel, I think it is no problem to stay in this hotel for a long time. The price/performance ratio is really high!

With a balcony, the air feels much better. The hotel breakfast is very rich, with both Chinese and Western food, duck blood soup, wontons, dumplings, tofu brain, Yangchun noodles... There are several restaurants in the hotel. We went to the Benwei restaurant on the second floor, and the products are good! The overall feeling of staying here is at home.

The price was reasonable and I made a reservation. Sure enough, I was not disappointed or even exceeded my expectations!
The location of the hotel is really good, just at Xinjiekou, the bus and subway are very convenient Hahaha, the hotel is no more than 30 minutes away from various attractions
I need to thank Xiaoxia for her room service for delivering breakfast to the room so that we who can't get up can enjoy breakfast leisurely! And Pan Na, the housekeeper on the floor, encountered us several times in the corridor and asked us carefully about our check-in experience and needs. When we returned to the room, we saw her note and a cute bunny folded in a towel! There is also the foreman Dong of the cafeteria who comes to our table every day to deliver a hotel-specific meal such as Yuhuashi glutinous rice balls and sesame cakes. He also actively asked if we need to extend our check-out! There is also Manager Hao who has been cordially communicating with my husband throughout the whole process, and the service is thoughtful! My husband urged me to give a good review hahahaha I really like the city of Nanjing and I plan to come here often. Next time I go to Nanjing, I will definitely choose Nanjing Central Hotel as my first choice. I recommend staying here!

First of all, the hotel facilities are good, check-in is super fast, and there are many elevators with reasonable configuration. On the day of check-in, before I took the elevator with other passengers, a waiter immediately reminded me that it would be faster to take the elevator in the west building.
The environment of the hotel is very beautiful, grand and grand, with a calm and elegant luxury style. Gorgeous waterfall-like crystal chandeliers, gorgeous and classical lobby, and graceful and luxurious decorative pillar design make all guests pleasing to the eye.
The service is even more top-notch. Every employee in the hotel greets the guests proactively and is extremely polite, making people feel comfortable and warm. This time, I would like to especially thank Mr. Hao, the manager of the lobby, for his careful arrangements. When I learned that I felt a little unwell on the first night when I checked in, I immediately asked the housekeeper on the floor to send a heater. When I was eating in the cafeteria the next morning, Xiao Xia, the breakfast staff, specially asked Xiao Xia to bring Yuhua glutinous rice balls, and arranged for Manager Lu on the floor to change my room to a suite in the main building. I was really flattered.
Stayed for 3 days, enjoying the service of being at home every day, rich breakfast, hygienic and clean. It can be seen that the management of the hotel is in place and the quality is strong! If you come to Nanjing for a business trip in the future, the Central Hotel will be your first choice! When leaving the store, the beauty at the front desk presented Chinese knots again, and sincerely wished the hotel good luck in the new year, prosperous business and better and better!

Will definitely stay here again next time.

Mr. Hao, the vice president of the hotel, we can see him serving everyone on the front line every day. With leaders like this, how can employees not work hard. The housekeeper Jia on the floor, with his ingenuity, made me a small surprise every day, and let us sweep away the hard work of shopping😂. Manager Dong of the restaurant is kind and lovely, and Yuhuashi glutinous rice balls are worthy of praise👍

It is very close to major shopping malls such as Xinjiekou, and you can walk there. The hotel's security measures are in place and the lobby is very grand. Housekeeper Xie also upgraded us to a suite with a strong sense of comfort. The service attitude is very good. He took us to change rooms and thoughtfully upgraded the room for our companions and arranged it next to our room, so that we can visit each other! Recommended! ! !

Just after check-in, when I was about to enter the room, I met Manager Liu who gave us welcome fruits and drinks, and then thoughtfully sent us disinfectant wipes.
During the stay, Manager Dai also cared meticulously.
When checking out, Manager Kou thoughtfully sent tissues and drinks for use on the road, and Manager Dai took him to check out.
There are thousands of hotels that I have stayed in on business trips. I really want to be a licking dog for this review. The service industry is most afraid of being too friendly, but not here, they are all like acquaintances. They are also very kind to tell where is the nearest nucleic acid testing point.
Speaking of other hardware, the Japanese-style design of the room is really exquisite, and every space is used to the extreme, especially the bathroom, small bathtub + half-height shower, and it can be seen that although the hotel is a few years old, it is well maintained .
The location is also very convenient, the most central Xinjiekou in Nanjing, you can eat and go shopping, and there are many niche coffee shops around

Facilities: The so-called old five-star hotel in Nanjing does not mean that the facilities are old, but the seniority will be added in time.
Hygiene: Hygiene is very good, and I didn't find any place to hide dirt in my room.
Environment: The hotel is within a five-minute walk from the subway entrance, very close
Breakfast: I stayed for two days. The first day was the buffet breakfast on the fourth floor. It was very good. There were many local characteristics. Manager Hao also arranged Yuhua stone dumplings. The next day was a Western-style breakfast that was brought to the room. The ingredients were very good and fresh. The drinks included black tea, coffee and orange juice. Of course, it was very good 😄.
Service: When cleaning is needed, the waiter will clean up in time and give me water every time😄 This means that I don't have to buy water when I go to the scenic spots, just take the water from the hotel, which is very thoughtful, and even brought back a fruit plate at night. After eating, take a comfortable bath! Very nice hotel, recommend to everyone.

Originally, I chose it for the convenience of transportation. After arriving, the overall experience of the hotel greatly exceeded my expectations. From check-in to check-out, the whole process makes people feel at home. The staff of the hotel are polite, warm and have a strong sense of service. Here I want to record my real experience:
1. Manager Gu was in charge of reception at the time of check-in, helped us upgrade a better room type, provided a map of Nanjing, a tourist guide, and an introduction to the adjacent Plaza 66, which was very considerate.
2. The room environment is good, very spacious, bright and clean. The cleaning supply is timely, the cleaning is in place, and the stay is very comfortable.
3. If you have any needs related to check-in, you can contact Manager Gu to get a timely reply and processing, thank you for your help.
Although it was only two days, it allowed me to experience super high-quality service, which is worthy of praise. Thank you for the warm and friendly staff I met at the Central Hotel these two days. It was a pleasant stay. A veritable old-fashioned hotel, worth recommending!

Room: It should be the largest room of the same type and the same price nearby. The dry and wet are separated. Although it is an old five-star (the door handle of the room is a bit historical), the room is newly furnished and has a light luxury style, which is very in line with the aesthetics of young people. Floor-to-ceiling windows, the sun sets in the west, and it is very comfortable.

The meticulous and thoughtful service of the hotel manager Hao and the team left us with wonderful memories. Especially the breakfast at Ge Dun Bay, we were very afraid to push the wheelchair when we saw several high steps. After talking to the staff, two male staff members came to help us lift the wheelchair. Although the restaurant does not have barrier-free access facilities, you set up an artificial barrier-free access, which made our two-day dining very smooth. Especially Xiao Wang, who was wearing your restaurant work clothes, participated in all four trips for two days.

My little teammates and I followed them.

—- meland —- 3rd floor of Wuyue Plaza, Jianye

I bought one big and one small on a certain fish website for ¥139.
I have been to three meland in Hangzhou. This one in Nanjing seems relatively small.
There are several different areas on one floor.
There is no toilet, not even on this floor.
It is really troublesome to go in and out to the toilet.
But this does not affect the children's love of playing.

The Qinhuai River was moved into the mall on the B1 floor.
It is also nice to stroll along the river bank without shopping.

My teammates worked and shot until 4 o'clock.
My little teammates also played until this time.
I finally fell asleep after waiting for my dad to pick me up after leaving the mall.
It was not hot outside in Nanjing at more than 4 o'clock.
There was no sun but wind.
My teammates went to the wrong mall and delayed for more than ten minutes.
I really had to use my hands to hold my 40-pound little teammates.

—- Shimonoseki Train Theme Park —-

20 minutes of walking, check in
The photos in the guide are really attractive
But the real scene is a little disappointing
The riverside is accompanied by the gentle wind
The old man's big kite flew high in the sky in a few seconds
Think about it if you come here to check in
Although the photos are not bad
A steam train and three green carriages
The carriage is the place for eating

Not many people, it feels like people walking nearby
Not recommended nor bad
Different environments have different feelings
If the road is far, there is no need to rush here to check in

Accommodation —- Nanjing Central Hotel —-

Five-star, a little old
During the epidemic, you should ask clearly about the epidemic prevention policy of the destination: different hotels are different. Some require 7 days of quarantine monitoring, and some require local 48-hour nucleic acid test certificates. This one is also acceptable for nucleic acid test certificates within 48 hours of departure.

Regular room ¥482/night without breakfast
The room layout is a bit awkward
There is a bathtub and shower room on one side and a washbasin on the other
There is an independent toilet next to the washbasin and the bed is further ahead
The room is relatively small and the facilities are a bit old
The front desk said that you can upgrade to an executive suite of 880 for an additional 50
My teammates are too lazy to go back and change again
Anyway, we came at a short notice, so we just make do with it

—-Deji Plaza—-
Opposite the hotel
It should be the best shopping mall in Nanjing
Luxury advertising design and architecture are all very beautiful

—- Confucius Temple Qinhuai River —-
The weather was good before going back, so I visited Confucius Temple for the second time
After 5 years, there is a little photographer who will take the initiative to go online
If you have plenty of time, you must visit Confucius Temple and Qinhuai River at night
The first time I came to Nanjing was in winter
Unexpectedly, it was Nanjing around 10 o'clock in the summer
There was no sun but there was wind Very suitable for visiting scenic spots
Not many tourists, many stores are closed
Commercialization is similar everywhere
Took the kids to visit Dangdang Bookstore on Gongyuan Street
Although there are many beautiful bookstores in Nanjing
Pioneer Bookstore, Singularity Books
Pioneer Garden Expo Park Silo Bookstore, etc. I want to go there
When the kids are older and the itinerary is not so convenient
I hope the kids will like reading and fall in love with reading
Then this will be the best reason to come to Nanjing again soon

First of all, the location is in the city center, not far from various Nanjing attractions, and it takes about 20 minutes to drive. Again, the room is clean, the interior decoration is also good, and the facilities are also complete. The key thing to talk about is the service, from the general manager Hao, to Xiao Jiang to see off guests, Xiao Xia to breakfast service, and to the floor housekeeper Pan Butler, they all treated us like friends and left a very good impression on me. The hotel is well managed. All in all, the stay was very pleasant and satisfying. Next time I come to Nanjing, I will choose his home!

msg:The first time I came to Nanjing, I didn't want to spend the night in Nanjing, but after discussing it with my friends, I decided to stay for one night. Friends have been screening the recommended hotels for a long time. The location is really good. It is close to the subway station and bus station. It is very convenient to travel. It takes less than 30 minutes to go to attractions such as the Ming Palace Museum. Going out through an underground passage is China Merchants Bank. The business is also very convenient, there are many luxury stores around, and the architectural style is more European. It may be because we booked a special room. The minibar in the room has no other drinks except soft drinks. It is not convenient to open the door with the room card. There are Nanjing travel magazines in the room, but they are not in season. fee, and I don't know how it actually works. I took time to go to the gym with my friends at noon to have a look. The space is relatively small, the swimming pool is a bit dirty, no one is exercising, and the supervision is relatively loose. The gym is equipped with mineral water, so you don't have to worry about dehydration. The Sichuan restaurant, Chinese restaurant, bakery and the like in the hotel are relatively complete, and the breakfast variety is relatively simple, but it is enough for business people. There are few seats on the first floor. I don’t know where to sit when I wait for my friends. There are holiday souvenirs for sale around the corner, which is not bad. The building and decoration are relatively beautiful, and the interior view is also very comfortable and warm, and I am generally satisfied.

msg:Nanjing's old five-star hotel, opposite Deji Square, the location is excellent! I saw many old five-star hotels with good reviews. At first, because I thought it was a long time ago, I was worried that the facilities were outdated and the service could not keep up. After I came here, it completely subverted my imagination. Because of the rain, as soon as I entered the hotel door, an uncle helped me. Parking, Mr. Hao at the front desk, and Manager Gu personally warmly received them. The deluxe room booked was recommended to be upgraded with a price increase and the American breakfast of the top hotels in Macau was delivered to the room. It is very large and the design is very user-friendly, and then the floor supervisor kindly sent drinks and bathtub membranes, especially the American-style meal delivery service of the hotel, which can be seen in the picture. Well arranged, this is a five-star hotel, and it is also a super five-star team. The enthusiasm makes people doubt life. The key is such a central location. At such a price, it is really good value for money. I have stayed in a lot of 5-star hotels in Nanjing. This is really a very direct recommendation, there is no need to choose, the boys just rush and it's over!

In the end, I chose the Central Hotel after reading various reviews. I was not disappointed. A good vehicle is listed for direct check-in, which is a great point. Several surrounding attractions are nearby, it is extremely convenient to go around and play. The hotel also upgraded my room. I am so lucky, the room layout is modern, and the toilet is separated from wet and dry. It's the style I like, I'm very satisfied overall, the breakfast is also very rich, and I was fortunate to taste the Yuhua stone dumplings given by the hotel, which are beautiful and delicious 😋, I will choose this one next time I come to Nanjing!

The manager at the front desk of the hotel has a good and thoughtful service attitude. He knew that we came to the test and specially upgraded the room for us. He also asked for any needs. I contacted him, because the next day we will be in the test room at 7 o'clock, and the hotel breakfast was too late. After contacting Manager Gu, he arranged a take-away breakfast for us, thank you very much! All the services in the central hotel are very good. The buffet on the first night is also eaten in the hotel. The service staff is also very attentive. Some freshly baked food just say hello and they will help you to get the meal. The overall type of buffet And the taste is also ok, especially the lamb chops! Worthy of praise👍🏼. In the future, I have the opportunity to choose the central hotel 🏨

msg:I made a hasty decision to travel to Nanjing. I didn't check the hotel carefully and chose this five-star hotel with a good location. However, it became the biggest failure of this trip. This is totally a false five-star rating. The family room I booked did seem okay at first glance, but outside the window was a huge restaurant blower, making the noise unbearable. After changing several rooms, I discovered that all rooms with this orientation had this problem. One thing to say, the clerk's attitude was very good and he changed us to a suite. This suite faced the other side, but this side was actually the lobby of the hotel. There was no window facing the outdoors. There was a sliding door that opened to the lobby. It looked like It's quite luxurious. In fact, the sound of buffet guest activities in the lobby and the smell of the restaurant are always present. Although it is a suite, it is not large in size. The decoration is probably from the 1990s. The light *****s make a constant buzzing noise. The socket on the table is broken, so my mobile phone has not been charged. We were given an extra bed, which was similar to a camp bed. We had no choice but to check other hotels overnight, and didn't go to bed until after one o'clock in the middle of the night. I checked out early the next morning and barely ate breakfast. It's really hard to say that the breakfast here is not as good as the breakfast in a five-star hotel. The food is terrible. The waiter who cooked the noodles kept chatting loudly. The Yuhua Stone Tangyuan is said to be the first of their kind. I almost thought that the Yuhuashi Tangyuan was an unpalatable food. It wasn’t until I ate this snack at the Red Mansion in the Republic of China that it was super soft, glutinous and sweet, and I realized that their Yuhuashi Tangyuan was really right. Guests are misled about Nanjing snacks. The most incomprehensible thing is that a manager-looking person in the hotel kept asking us how we felt during breakfast. I tried my best to tolerate the implicit expression of dissatisfaction. He also came to us over and over again and told us to see him next time we come to Nanjing and he would arrange it in advance. They even called us to explain after we had left the hotel. It gives me the feeling that this manager is afraid that we will give bad reviews, so he keeps using words and flattery to control the reviews. This is probably why this hotel has such high ratings on Ctrip. If you are also a guest who has requirements for hotel living conditions, do not stay here. If you look at the cheapest room price, you will know that this cannot be a true five-star hotel.

Finally, there was nothing we could do, and the hotel provided a small oil tin. We stayed in a parent-child room, but the crib was a folding bed similar to an extra bed. The crib was too hard and seriously affected our sleep. The items provided in the hotel room are incomplete and cannot be compared with the five-star hotel. The hotel room service response is too slow. The overall score is the lowest. I will never stay here again in my life because this hotel is no different from a three-star hotel.

Although there were some small episodes during the check-in, the room at the beginning of the check-in may not be cleaned up due to the luggage blocking the garbage, but when we contacted the floor manager, she actively admitted that it was the hotel's fault and did not shirk any responsibility. And free room upgrade measures to make up for mistakes made in a timely manner. This kind of responsibility is rare among other hotel managers, and it is worth learning from other hotel managers! In addition, Manager Hao at the front desk is also a responsible manager. He has cared about us in every possible way since we entered the hotel. After the episode, he also greeted us with great concern, which made us feel the care from different places. In short, if you come to Nanjing, listen to my choice of Nanjing Central Hotel, and you will never go the wrong way.

🍃Environment: I booked a Lijing King bed and spent 50 to upgrade it because the front desk kindly informed Lijing that the decoration has been more than ten years, but if I knew when I placed the order, I would not choose this hotel...
Closer to home


🔔Service: Very good.
I asked room service for ice at two in the morning, and I forgot to say thank you, so I'll add it here.

msg:As a Nanjing native, the Central Hotel is also an old-fashioned five-star hotel with memories from childhood to adulthood. In Xinjiekou, where there are many good hotels with fierce competition, the center is excellent both in terms of brand and location.

Booked a room for a friend. The first time I checked in and caught up with the epidemic, it opened on the first day and was upgraded by surprise. This time, I stayed in time for the college entrance examination, and it was also my friend who asked to stay after the first experience.

Recommended deluxe executive room, this room type is very spacious and comfortable, in the center of Xinjiekou, this location room type and price, very good value.

In particular, I would like to commend Miss Wang Meijuan from the housekeeping team. She is very, very enthusiastic and professional. The first time I met her was that she had already left work and continued to provide good services. This time I met again, and I was very kind to this Nanjing girl.

The hotel is very user-friendly. Although the check-out is stipulated at 12:00, there is no room tension and can be delayed. The hygiene is very clean, and the old-fashioned hotel has the attitude of the old-fashioned hotel there.

The hotel service team as a whole is worthy of praise. At the moment when the competition in the hotel industry is so fierce, it is rare to be able to stick to the service and the original intention of hotel service, so that guests can feel like going home again.

The location is opposite to Deji, near Xinjiekou, the transportation is convenient, and the hotel environment is also very good. Speaking of Service, the hotel manager Lu received the whole process, the service is first-class, the gentle voice, coupled with the high-quality service, is worthy of the reputation of a five-star hotel.

The room is spacious and has all the equipment and supplies. Deji is outside the floor-to-ceiling window. It really only takes a minute or two to walk. Not an exaggeration). With attentive butler service, Manager Lu and Butler Zhen were so meticulous that they noticed that I used a disposable bath bag, and replaced it with a brand new one the next day. The takeaway is also delivered upstairs by a special person in time, and every time I am impressed by the hotel's humanized service! I chose room service for breakfast this time, and the selected breakfast was delivered to the room by a special person. It's really great for a lazy person like me. I ate slowly while watching the screen TV, and drank half a pot of coffee, very comfortable! Of course, the hotel's buffet breakfast is also at the ceiling level of Nanjing Hotel. There are many varieties and tastes. I have already given the hotel to my sisters! ! It is really the use of "home away from home" to the extreme!

The room is clean and hygienic, the bedding is very comfortable, and the location of the hotel is also good. After checking in, you can directly walk around to meet various needs

msg:The second phase of Deji Plaza is just outside the hotel, which is very convenient for delivery and shopping. Originally booked the Lijing King Room, which belongs to the old building that has not been renovated. The room size and hardware facilities are too old, so we decided to upgrade the deluxe executive room.

When visiting the room type, the service staff Wang Meijuan was kind, took the initiative to introduce the room type and contacted the front desk for help, which met our needs very well. The front desk staff also truthfully informed the price difference to avoid excessive consumption.

The breakfast is on the 4th floor, you can dine by registering the room number. It adopts a combination of Chinese and Western self-service. The taste is medium, but it is only served until 0930. I hope the hotel can extend the time and take care of the guests who wake up late.

The hotel really takes care of the needs of each guest, with a sincere and proactive attitude, plus its location in Xinjiekou, I will choose this hotel next time I stay in Nanjing.

It is a three-minute walk to Deji to eat, drink and play. The subway station and bus station are close at hand, and travel is convenient and fast.

When the car entered the hotel gate, Mr. Zhang warmly greeted and instructed to park the car, and helped to move the heavy luggage from the underground parking lot to the hotel lobby. Arrived at the lobby, I was warmly received by the hotel's executive general manager, Mr. Hao.

Mr. Hao helped me after the check-in and personally helped me move the luggage to the At the door of the room on the 10th floor, the room manager brought fruit when we arrived, and sent different gifts every day in addition to cleaning the room. The facilities of the fresh air room are the same as those in the promotional pictures. Standing on the balcony of the hotel to see the cafeteria on the second floor is very exotic. When you get up in the morning, open the balcony door and a ray of warm sunlight ☀️ shines into the room to start a day full of vitality. The environment of the breakfast restaurant is elegant, the food is fresh and delicious, and there are many kinds of extras. Yuhua stone dumplings are so exquisite that my daughter and I are reluctant to eat them. During the New Year's Day holiday, the staff of Sanxing Center Hotel gave us too many surprises to make the holiday more warm and happy! Thanks again 🙏 for their dedication.

The service attitude is good and the hygiene is good. In this off-season, the price of Ctrip is also cheap. I feel that it is worth the money. The beautiful sister at the front desk even upgraded it. Thank you so much, I will come again in the future.

Seeing that we took the child to live, I also specially gave me small slippers, toothbrushes, and disposable bathtub covers. Before checking out, the child accidentally broke a cup and told the front desk, the front desk said it was okay! No compensation. In short, it is a hotel with super good service and will stay here next time I go to play! Hope is getting better and better!

He sends us snacks every day, such as Yuhua glutinous rice balls, spring rolls, mung bean soup, etc., which is especially heartwarming!

On the last day, we have been waiting for the nucleic acid results. Manager Hao especially delayed our check-out time for us. Thank you so much. I stayed for 5 nights this time.

Manager Lu and Supervisor Wang on the floor are very enthusiastic. They helped the children fold small animals, gave them handmade yogurt and origami, and thoughtfully prepared disposable toilet mats and bath bags. They wrote cards and sent fruits when they returned to the room at night. I originally booked for only one day, fearing that I would step on a thunder. As a result, I was impressed by the hotel service and the room, so I decided to stay for another night. This time I booked a family room. Because of the two children, the staff also helped to bring the baby quilt. The whole process was smiling service, and the enthusiastic greetings from the hotel manager Hao. After leaving the hotel, they also sent macaron desserts. I was very happy to stay this time. Thank you 🙏 the service staff. This hotel is a must-choose hotel for my next trip...

The salted duck is a must in Nanjing. The salted duck made in the center has the best taste. Although the parking spaces in the city center are very tight, the center provides free parking services. That's it. 👏Also, I am more satisfied with smokers at home, and the small balcony is tailor-made.

Line 1 and Line 2 are good for visiting various exhibition halls and sightseeing. Two more bottles of water every day in hot weather, great! You can also send luggage for free and help you find a way and call a car. It’s good to walk to Mingwa Gallery. Come live again next time! Forgot to take pictures of the room.

The staff’s vision and patience are very good, and the management often walks around in the front line to see the strength of the hotel’s brand maintenance. The room is simple, comfortable and spacious. At the beginning, I only booked one night because I was satisfied with the comfort level. The room cleaning and service on the next day are worth mentioning! I went back to the room in the afternoon and encountered a clean inspection. I took the initiative to ask the guests' opinions and suggestions and adjusted and improved the small details in time. It was great! The first-line service should respond like this 👍The sanitary napkins were nowhere to be placed after taking a bath, and the drying rod was added, which solved the problem very well. In the afternoon, they also presented the hotel’s homemade seasonal snacks, and they also specially sent their hands on the next day. Li and Nanjing's characteristic Yuhua Stone (the design is particularly beautiful) will go to Jinling in the future and will choose to stay in the central hotel again!

二、早餐不錯。
食物品質看着就好吃，擺盤整齊乾淨；品種多，中西餐都有；也有地方特色菜，如鴨血粉絲湯，有鹹水鴨，雨花石湯圓，糖苗芋等。

msg:第一次來南京，充分感受到了南京這個城市的熱情。南京中心大酒店不虧是老牌的五星酒店，住的舒適，自助早餐很好，酒店位置也好，靠近德基，出行去總統府，老門東，夫子廟秦淮河等等都很近，打車不過十分鐘。在酒店的三天讓我深刻體會到了五星級酒店和服務，從送客服務的蔣經理，到送水果和曲奇餅乾的潘管家服務都是棒棒噠，飯店住宿會添加微信，方便隨時提出需要。知道有小孩，會給送來零食，飲用水和紙巾。退房的時候也送了臉譜中國結，讓我們的歸程平平安安。真心感謝酒店的熱情服務，也慶幸自己選擇了這裏。

msg:帶着一家老小來南京旅遊，下了高鐵直奔中心酒店，出發前在網上對比了下，覺得這家酒店在5星當中性價比最高，地理位置優越，對面就是德基廣場，辦理入住時，酒店郝經理聽説我們一家子來旅遊的，免費幫我們升級了房型，樓層王主管和寇管家服務也周到，居然貼心的為我們送來了小朋友的用具和新鮮的果盤，自助早餐種類也豐富，服務員小董還送來了南京特色雨花石湯圓，入住後讓我們對南京的印象都很好，家人對這次的安排特別滿意。房間的隔音效果也不錯，門關起來，外面很安靜，可以睡個舒服的好覺。

因為太晚喝了一杯茶顏悦色[破涕為笑]  
所以擔心晚上睡覺不踏實   影響第二天的工作      
想換一個不臨街的房間   

王主管二話不説   馬上去協調   
因為已經很晚   我很擔心協調不出房間   
沒有報太大希望   
過一會王主管回來  説幫我協調好了
太感謝了[合十]
熟悉的房間  熟悉的味道  睡了一個好覺[呲牙]

去吃早餐  員工都有禮貌的問好   給她們的服務點贊👍
早餐很豐富   作為老顧客可以獨享一份木瓜雪蛤  出品挺好    心裏美美的[愛心]     
還有可愛的雨花石湯圓  一定要嘗一下   很好吃

下次南京出差再見嘍南京中心大酒店❤

辦理入住：辦理入住時郝總看到孩子大了，主動給安排了寬敞一些的房間，還幫助拿行李送到房間；
酒店位置：酒店在德基二期正對面，一條馬路的距離，距離夫子廟、老門東、總統府等都是單車20分鐘之內的距離；
酒店服務：樓層王主管李管家疊了動物動物毛巾，送了水果、飲料，還貼心的留了新年祝福便簽，服務熱情周到；
酒店早餐：酒店推薦加了早餐，完全超出我們預期，幾乎所有的南京小吃都有，鴨血粉絲湯、小籠湯包、鹽水鴨、糖水，還有很多其他中西式早餐，品種多、口感好，最好錯過8：30用餐高峯。

設施：設施挺齊全，淋浴的花灑水壓挺舒服，特別是大床床墊很舒適。
衞生：很乾凈，房間沒有任何不舒服的氣味。每天回來都會一個温馨紙條，特別是這個樓層的大姐，除夕晚上為我們加被子，態度很親切。
感謝遇到的每一位南京中心大酒店，你們的敬業讓我們感受到南京這座城市的美麗和温暖

msg:酒店位置好靠近德基，距離德基十分進，對面就是Burberry, 作為五星級酒店服務質量十分好，尤其是送客服務蔣煒師傅，十分的周到，來時迎接我們熟悉酒店環境和硬件設施，告訴我們南京的遊玩攻略，我定的外賣蔣叔也會幫忙拿上來，每天都有礦泉水和新鮮的水果，十分感謝！其中房間蘆管家會送新鮮的水果以及退房送小禮物。前台小許服務很細心，作為遊客，讓人對於南京遊玩的第一印象十分好。

很感謝中心酒店帶給我的體驗，飲食住行是旅遊的根基，也是必不可少的元素，在“住”方面，中心酒店無論是從房間、環境、地理位置的硬件條件，還是從服務人員帶給我們的無形體驗上，都值得顧客再次惠顧。南京是座很有温度的城市，明年再來時我還會選擇中心酒店，謝謝這裏的工作人員。

哦對了，進入酒店的工作人員一直會把門打開，以便於顧客徑直進入酒店，這些細節看似很小，但在南京冬日嚴寒濕冷的天氣下是多麼可貴，辛苦，謝謝！

Ps:忘記拍環境了，附一張當時在酒店訂的咖啡吧。

msg:這次回南京看學友演唱會訂了南京中心大酒店。
首先地理位置名副其實，中心大酒店，就在南京的市中心商業中心黃金地段新街口，與德基廣場一路之隔。所以酒店的宣傳語是：離德基最近的酒店。我想説的是現在最近的應該是麗思卡爾頓了吧哈哈😂
酒店設施：雖説是老牌酒店，但是公共設施和房間設施看上去維護的不錯，有種老牌酒店的底藴，尤其自助餐廳閣敦灣的設計很有東南亞風情，就餐環境很舒適。正值聖誕來臨之際，酒店還做了聖誕佈置。
停車場：市中心寸土寸金可以免費停車已經很不錯了，受制於年代久遠地下停車場有點小，如果是轎車的話可以停在門口的立體車庫。大車衹能停地下或者地面了。好在有師傅在門口全程幫忙引導。
最後着重説一下酒店的早餐和服務：也吃過大大小小國內國外很多五星酒店的早餐了，這個價位的住宿的早餐的品種真是多到令人眼花繚亂，無敵了，無論是西式還是中式一應俱全，還有南京本土的特色鹽水鴨，鴨血粉絲應有盡有。而且每一種的品質都很高。完全不輸一些國際連鎖酒店的早餐。還有那台很有感覺古老的自動咖啡機我印象深刻，衹是忘了拍照了哈哈。這一次雖説衹住了一晚，前台還免費幫我做了房型升級。從前台，客房服務員到客户經理都讓你感覺賓至如歸。服務員會主動跟你打招呼提供服務，服務意識很強。
下次會繼續選擇入住。

再來説説房間本身，衞生間乾濕分離，打掃的十分乾淨整潔，浴巾毛巾每天都有換，洗的很乾凈和柔軟，床也睡得很舒服，整體在清潔度上特別滿意。而且客房還會給我們疊小玩偶，很可愛逗趣。
酒店旁邊就是南京最好逛的德基廣場，在 新街口地鐵站，去哪裡都很方便。
本味餐廳服務也很優秀，菜品精緻。
相當低調優秀的南京老牌五星級酒店，實在想不出有什麼缺點，最近健身房和游泳池在升級中，如果下次再來的時候有機會體驗一下就更完美了。

單獨的半圓形樓，內部裝修是傳統風格，停車位不少。
服務很好，該有的都有。為保證安全外賣統一不進樓，由服務人員幫送。衞生打掃的也不錯，基本上肉眼沒看到什麼臟東西和頭髮。
早餐種類不少，味道也不錯，小餛飩很棒。
總而言之住的很舒服，下次來南京會考慮再次入住。

2.酒店軟硬件俱佳，尤其服務滿分，或許是酒店領導郝總的以身作則，也或許是酒店的企業文化，從客房管家到前台接待都彬彬有禮，讓人感受到真正的以客户為中心。
3.此次入住麗景雙床房，房間空調給力，室內空氣清新無異味，房間安靜，淋浴間的花灑五金沒有水漬非常乾淨。衞生滿分。
值得推薦的好酒店！

一進酒店，就感受到了酒店工作人員的熱情，走到哪裡遇到都會微笑對我們打招呼，這點真的要好好誇誇！對小寶寶也很關心照顧，見到我們帶孩子立馬幫我們房間準備了寶寶的拖鞋還有洗漱用品，第二天還準備了小小驚喜（圖二）哈哈
我們定了三間房，有兩間房是家人住的，對於枕頭的要求可能都不一樣，我跟戴經理微信聯繫反饋了問題及要求後，也立馬安排幫忙換了合適的枕頭，十分感謝！
還有負責打掃我們客房的丁阿姨，每次需要打掃時都會仔細問我們哪些地方需要注意打掃清潔的，因為我們人也比較多所以也一直會很及時地給我們送水。
感謝樓層賈管家、戴經理、客房打掃的丁阿姨，還有其他有緣遇見但不知其名的工作人員～光服務這點，就已經達到我心目中五星級酒店的標準了！

1.地理位置：對面就是德基，離地鐵1、2號線步行5分鐘左  右，打車去市裡的景點也都十幾塊錢，很方便。
2.房間設施：房間在行政層，屋裡的鏡子很多，兩個女孩真的很方便，化粧不用等，可以同時進行。衣櫃空間足夠用，屋裡有足夠的桌椅，方便吃外賣。
3.酒店服務：非常熱情妥帖，碰巧遇見郝副總接待我們，升級房間介紹景點，主動詢問並解決客人的需求。主動送了歡迎水果，介紹主管，我們住的時間長，服務部主管主動給我們拿了很多衣架來，特別貼心。
3.停車服務：停車免費的，停車場的工作人員非常熱情，主動指揮停車，驚喜的是，到達當天還幫忙把車洗了，離開時停車場的老張師傅還特意把車的外觀擦洗乾淨了。
  總之酒店整個住宿感很棒！會安利給周圍朋友。希望大家都來入住中心大酒店。

衞生：真的臟，肉眼可見的灰塵在房間的各個角落
設施：很老很舊
一個老牌星級酒店哪怕是舊一些但是起碼的衞生條件要達到吧。真不明白怎麼能做的那麼差
其次是十一點的時候客服電話就打通了，更神奇的是半夜衞生間電話響了兩次，真的被嚇死了
以後再也不會來住了！

設施：很齊全
衞生：很乾凈
環境：挺好的

酒店有個漂亮的中庭，房間也明亮舒適。
要特別説一下的是，酒店的郝總和他的團隊，提供了特別優質的服務。因為我自身的原因，入住後又更換了房間，他們都細緻耐心地解決了問題，讓我得到一個完美的旅程。我每天接觸的樓層寇管家、潘管家，還有早餐小董，耐心細緻，熱情周到，真正帶給了顧客賓至如歸的享受。
這是一家值得再來，也值得向朋友推薦的酒店。

房間雅緻、床具雪白、早餐豐盛，所有服務讓賓客十分感動、萬分滿意。從上而下，完美貫通，這實在是太難了，卻被你們做到了。

解放前，我爺爺奶奶的家就在沈舉人巷，*****他們回到了崑山老家。平反後住到雍園。每次隨父母探親，都會選擇中心大酒店，不改初心。

我的朋友們來南京都會推薦入住。另外，本次9月27至10月27日入住六日，82歲的老媽得到了全面關照，特別對前台小陳、樓層方管家、早餐小夏等幾位工作人員耐心細膩的服務表示衷心的感謝。再㊗️酒店不斷傳承優良店風，永遠是南京的金字招牌[玫瑰][玫瑰][玫瑰]

衞生：我有比較嚴重的慢性蕁麻疹，晚上必須吃氯雷他定片，所以對床有比較高的要求，就連住家裡也會過敏，但在這家酒店住的時候完全沒有吃葯，衞生滿分好吧！！！

環境：屬於南京市中心地段，去任何一個酒店都很方便！

服務：簡直不要太好，住過很多家酒店，這家真的是把客户放在心上，很多要求他們都能滿足甚至為你爭取額外的贈品，我來時前台送我的攻略解決了去南京所有吃和玩，走的時候送了我一個小禮物很走心好吧，一樣也是滿分！

總體上説這次來南京玩真的很快樂，南京人真的非常熱情好客，物價也不是很貴，最主要的是南京地鐵比廣州的三號線好太多太多太多了！！！

不管來寧是出差還是旅遊我都強烈推薦這家😭
🙋亮點絕對是服務👌➕位置（旁邊就是德基 🛍️超方便）
不吹不黑 就這個價位 酒店能給到的服務真的拉滿了 
首先是checkin的時候會有漂亮的迎賓小姐姐帶你上電梯認房間 其次是入住之後會有王主管送來免費minibar➕水果下午茶 還有貼心的張管家 會一直説有任何需求都儘管提 酒店也真的在儘量滿足🥰出門遇到的員工都會主動跟客人打招呼 真的有種賓至如歸的感覺！
服務這麼好就算了！酒店的環境也很nice❤️酒店內部金碧輝煌 一整個高端大氣上檔次的感覺哈哈哈哈哈反正商務宴請啥的沒毛病的 
另外 作為一家成立已經三十年的酒店 硬件上也保持與時俱進 房間內智能觸控設備控制燈光 床品也很舒服 我們的房間帶🛁 張管家還貼心的送了一次性浴缸套 很多小細節都能看出來酒店對乾淨衞生的要求（雖然當然 這是基本的 但是不可否認有這些細節就是很舒服 可能是它的價格真的給我加了很多濾鏡 他才五百塊啊五百塊！！！

msg:大年初六和兒子突然決定來一趟説走就走的旅行，目的地選在南京的原因是在此之前去過江南多地，唯獨南京一次都沒去過。票搶完後，酒店的選擇我們首選新街口附近，再加上網上一些旅遊博主南京住酒店經歷的參考，最終我們選擇了南京中心大酒店，選擇的原因一是因為它雖是五星級酒店，但價格合理，性價比超高；二是它與最大的南京商圈德基廣場衹有一條馬路之隔，吃飯購物都很方便.初七晚上九點多我們辦理入住手續的時候，我跟前台的服務小哥説能否給我們樓層高一點的房間，我第一次來南京，想欣賞一下南京的夜景及市容市貌，無心的一句話，正好被一旁的酒店經理聽到，他立即親自操作，不僅給我們選了酒店的最高層，還免費給我們升了商務套房（我們訂的是普通大床房。此次唯一的遺憾是沒記住酒店經理的名字[捂臉][捂臉][捂臉]，有點內疚），辦好入住手續，當日值班的大堂經理蔣先生還親自把行李給我們送到房間，緊接着酒店領班又親自送來一次性泡澡袋和幾瓶礦泉水，剛到酒店就真真的感受到了南京人濃濃的的熱情，從未想到，2024農曆新年的第一份温暖和感動是南京中心大酒店的領導和員工給的[微笑][微笑][微笑]。酒店房間既温馨又乾淨整潔，被褥乾爽，洗浴體驗感也很好，早餐中式西式品類很多，尤其喜歡吃他家的餛飩，味鮮餡大，咖啡也很好喝，特別感謝餐廳的領班董女士每天早起的特殊投喂。此次的南京之旅從入住中心大酒店的那一刻起心裏就充滿了感動，很感謝也很感恩，謝謝南京中心大酒店的工作人員，謝謝熱情好客的南京人民！

msg:出行前預選了5家酒店（南京中心大酒店、維景國際、金陵狀元樓、金陵飯店、金鷹國際），綜合考量，最終選定了中心大酒店。事實證明，絕對沒有選錯。酒店處於新街口商圈，距離地鐵站不足400米，與德基廣場更是面對面相望。對於經常出遊的家人來説，這是目前為止體驗最好的一次，也是最超出期待的一次！帶着孩子和長者出行，禮賓部大哥不僅主動幫我們拿行李，還主動將行李送到了房間，一路上為我們介紹了很多南京特色小吃和著名景點。前台辦理入住時，酒店貼心的為旅客準備了自製的景點+商圈+交通圖冊，非常細心！進入房間，映入眼簾的是酒店為孩子準備的“小兔子”，以及新鮮的水果。樓層管家也非常貼心的送上了小童用拖鞋和洗漱用品。客房收拾的乾淨衞生，處處體現出細緻入微。酒店早餐相當豐富，手工包的小餛飩、灌湯包、南京特色小點心，更是有幸品嚐到了服務人員小夏為旅客準備的雨花湯圓，早餐口感非常好，讓人流連忘返。郝健經理更是像老大哥一樣關懷備至，非常感謝！值得一提的是，旅客入住前，酒店工作人員會提前插上取電卡，調整好房間的温度，這是很多其它五星酒店所沒有的服務，很是貼心。南京中心大酒店，是個有温度有感情的酒店，無微不至的關懷，讓人體會到了賓至如歸的感覺。再次感謝郝健經理、樓層管家、餐廳小夏、禮賓部大哥、前台入住辦理人員、保潔阿姨，以及中心大酒店的全體人員。出差、旅行，南京中心大酒店絕對是不二之選！

上次入住留下了深刻的服務印象，所以這次又連續住了兩天，以後來南京還是住這裏。因為去哪裡都方便，離地鐵站也特別近。

相比隔壁兩家酒店，我覺得中心大酒店性價比極高了，服務也相當到位熱情。這一次感謝顧經理、盧經理和小謝讓我們的南京之旅愉悦愜意。

msg:房間很乾凈很好，有陽台。樓層的賈管家和戴經理人超級好，入住的第一天送了水果，後面每天都有送水，給我們一個酒店的旅行推薦小冊子（有景點規劃和當地美食），可以幫忙規劃行程。因為來的第一天媽媽晚上洗了衣服，掛在浴缸的架子上，後面阿姨還幫我拿走去烘乾了，還寫了小紙條，非常感謝。

然後是應該是打掃房間的丁阿姨，有天早上去靈谷寺，下午後發現床單上有一個特別可愛用毛巾疊的小兔子，一直捨不得用。床單和枕頭套也是每天換的，很乾凈！

酒店位置很不錯，走到地鐵大概4分鐘（？）反正很快，去大部分的景點地鐵都30分鐘內。寄存行李也很方便。外賣都放在門口，可以下去拿也可以打電話讓送上來。因為電梯很方便，我一般下去拿，也就1-2分鐘。

住了三天，總體居住體驗很好。

msg:老牌五星，環境優美，鬧中取靜，位置就在德基面對面交通非常方便，酒店工作人員都很nice，半夜幫忙把行李搬到房間，客房清潔還折了可愛的毛巾兔子，唯一不足電視機老舊衹能看電視，隔音不好，不過還挺有性價比，下次來還會考慮住這邊

msg:酒店環境還是非常不錯的，打車方便，對面就是德基廣場走路過去方便，酒店門口有個吃早餐的小餐館很方便哦。酒店衞生還算乾淨，衹不過就是打掃不夠仔細，桌面的灰塵很多，地毯上也是，吸下塵可能就更好。房間設施比較陳舊，走廊隔音效果好，但靠近馬路的窗户隔音就有點吵，外面馬路的車開過，關着窗户的房間裏都聽到。
