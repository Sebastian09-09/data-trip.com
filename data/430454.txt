The food was amazing specially the breakfast, quite international and tasty. The hotel had a variety of amenities but many of them are extra paid which is something you're not expecting when you book a 5 start hotel. In any case great for a weekend getaway.

The buffet restaurant has very good selection of sushi and fish and meats, and the beer is included. The Chinese restaurant is also pretty good at a reasonable price. If you need a few things for shopping, just go across the street near the Holiday Inn.

msg:My worst stay in the Sheraton chain ever.
Arrived at 2:30/3pm and had to wait forever for the room to be ready. Then we find out that the pool & the gym are closed. The breakfast was bad with no fresh juice and a poor selection of products. We wanted to have the buffet dinner but it's only available on friday and saturday. One of the morning, wanted to take a shower but there was no hot water. The hotel looks old, not well maintained... not mentioned some stupid policy or rules like opening only one door for breakfast so you have to walk all the way around, the fact then when you have question they don't have proper answers so on and so on. If at least they mentioned all that online when booking we for sure wouldn't have been there. Visited many Sheraton in China and this one is the worst, shouldn't even be called a Sheraton.
I have to go back in Haikou in november and one sure thing is that i won't stay there

Hygiene: The sanitation is very clean. All service staff are very friendly and will smile and say Hi when they meet. The garden is very tidy and the swimming pool is also very clean.
Environment: The overall environment of the hotel is good, the breakfast is delicious and rich in variety. The children's water parent-child park is also very large, the water is deep, and there are many water toys for rent. The swimming pool is also quite large, and all kinds of supporting facilities are good. It is suitable for staying in the hotel and enjoying a slow-paced seaside vacation.
Service: The overall service is good and worth staying. I would like to make a small suggestion. It is recommended that the TV be equipped with a video-on-demand function. The children want to watch cartoons, but unfortunately there is no video-on-demand function.

msg:Stayed at the Sheraton Hotel in Haikou, which has a first-class sea view on the west coast and a very good location. After checking in, I communicated with the front desk that I would stay for 4 nights. Please give me a room with a high floor and good air. The front desk arranged a second room in the corner on the 3rd floor. The smell of mold was strong as soon as I entered the room. It was so irritating that I immediately went to the front desk and asked to change rooms. In the end, I was moved to the second room in the same corner one floor higher. At 10 o'clock in the evening, my 5-year-old grandson couldn't sleep and complained that the smell was too strong. We two old people also felt throat discomfort. I called room service and a dehumidifier was delivered. The next morning I met the room service manager Ms. Chen Wen Ai. I told her that the room smelled bad and I wanted to see if other rooms had the same smell. She immediately took me to see it. I took the room in the middle and it smelled much better when I entered the room. I decided to change rooms. Special thanks to Ms. Chen. Her rearrangement made our regretful mood happy. I would also like to thank Mr. Wang Xiaode of the restaurant for his warm and thoughtful service. Finally, I just want to say that the management of front desk business capabilities needs to be improved. Under the premise of high vacancy rate, rooms with good locations should be arranged first. Only in this way can we make money and attract more guests to stay. I will give the service 3 points for the first time. , 2 points will be deducted from the front desk

We hurried downstairs and found that the car windows were covered with plastic film by the staff. No water had poured into the car.

What is there to worry about when staying in such a responsible hotel? Thank you to all the lovely and beloved staff for your hard work. The kids had a lot of fun playing in the big swimming pool.

The service of the hotel is impeccable. The staff are warm and friendly, professional and thoughtful. They always treat every guest with a smile and patience, making people feel the warmth of home.

The hotel's catering is also excellent. Whether it is a hearty breakfast or an exquisite dinner, it can meet the taste buds of guests. In addition, the hotel is also equipped with complete leisure and entertainment facilities, allowing guests to relax in their spare time.

In short, this hotel has become an ideal choice for many travelers with its excellent quality and outstanding performance.

The service was very thoughtful and she solved my problems as soon as possible. The view from the room was also very good, so I was generally very satisfied. Even though my flight was delayed, they also arranged a flight extension for me, so I had a place to rest. Otherwise, I wouldn't know where to go. I am very grateful to Lesly for her arrangement.

Finally, after contacting Ctrip's manual customer service, the original high-priced order was cancelled. I hope Ctrip can provide better services from the customer's perspective. Otherwise, it is easy to lose customer stickiness.

The sea view room has a beautiful view and a terrace to enjoy the view. The facilities in the room are very complete and comfortable. I really like the facilities with a view, the swimming pool, the swing, and the yard door. You can go to the beach and step on the sand directly, just like the hotel's own beach. I will stay here again next time and try the food and afternoon tea.

Basically, the spring, summer, autumn and winter of Haikou have been gathered!
The last time I came was winter, the hotel lobby was under renovation, and the sea breeze blew. When the front desk lady checked in, she saw that I was a frequent guest and decisively upgraded the suite. It was a big surpriseü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ and introduced the upgraded layout of the hotel lobby in detail. It was double the heartwarming haha, give Miss Yuki a big ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
The hotel is right on the beach, and children who like to dig sand will definitely like it;
The swimming pool slide is well maintained (compared to some hotels in Sanya, it is really terrible), and children who like excitement will definitely like it;
It is said that the quality of the buffet has declined, but the price of the buffet has also been adjusted a lot. I hope that the quality and quantity can be guaranteed.
In general, it will definitely not be wrong to bring your children here.
Looking forward to the next timeüéèüéèüéè

The room was arranged on the underground floor and it was a bit damp. On the second day, we asked the front desk if we could change it. The front desk took the initiative to help us move to a room on a higher floor, and also helped to deliver the luggage directly to the new room. The service was very considerate. On the last day, the flight was delayed, and Nick at the hotel front desk helped to delay the check-out to two o'clock in the afternoon. The service attitude was very good.

The 3-day and 2-night package was very suitable, basically all-inclusive except for lunch and dinner. I compared the hotel when booking. The hotel is a little far from the city, but you can go directly to the beach from the hotel. The swimming pool is relatively large, the slide is also longer, and there is an electric floating board floating on the water that the children like very much. The hot spring pool is next to the swimming pool, which is also convenient for watching the children. The breakfast is very rich and there is no crowding. There are many parent-child activities designed for the Qingming Festival. I also went to the CDF duty-free shop. The government coupons are good recently. In short, the overall situation is very good üëçüèª!

It is very inconvenient to take a taxi to catch up with the cars leaving the island during the New Year and the traffic jam is serious. The nearest shopping district is 2 kilometers away, so you can only order takeaway. You need to take a taxi to reach the attractions. The basic drive is about half an hour. It is about 3 kilometers away from Holiday Beach (but the hotel has a public beach). The hotel's environment and external facilities are okay. There are swimming pools and hot springs, which are enough for children to play, and the hotel is there every day. There are family activities. For meals, there are buffets and a la carte. The price is about 120 per person. You can buy coupons at **.
I would like to focus on the room facilities. The parent-child room I booked this time had outdated facilities and heavy moisture. Even the double-hole sockets in the room could not be plugged in. The shower head was clogged on the first day, so I called maintenance to fix it. The tableware for the afternoon tea was rusty, and I was told directly that the coupon I bought for the afternoon tea couldn't be repaired.
The overall experience was okay, but not up to five-star standards, but I won't stay here again.

2. If you need to spend money to eat buffet breakfast and dinner, I don‚Äôt recommend it. Breakfast is better than convenience, but there is nothing delicious in the dinner buffet... Hot pot is available, but the meat is too bad. Except for the salmon, which is the highlight, nothing else is really good. Yes, it takes 5 minutes to drive, 1.5 kilometers to take a taxi, and half an hour to walk. There are several nearby restaurants that are all fine.
3. Does it look like five stars? The service is really not five-star! The housekeeper called in advance to inquire about check-in and then added WeChat. It was really funny that he didn't reply for a long time after searching for something. He didn't even reply on the last day. It was quite funny. At least reply with a respectful um? If the holiday is approaching for the New Year, shouldn‚Äôt we also mention it?
4. Forget it, the indoor children's playground in the hotel is very simple, and the hygiene is simply worrying!
5. Winter vacation/Spring Festival parent-child activities: The activity room is also very old, and the hygiene is also...the activities look good, but in fact they are boring and perfunctory!
6. Island travel photography: Fortunately, there is no sales promotion throughout the travel photography process

It was the first time for my mother-in-law to stay in a hotel where the laundry could not be done overnight, and she was also quite depressed.

msg:The hotel lobby is very beautiful, but the rooms are a bit old, but they are well maintained. It is said that they are planning to renovate the guest rooms, which should have some intelligent equipment. The hotel garden is very beautiful, the air is fresh, and it is very close to the beach, just walking through the garden. You can also ride on the beach all the way to the city. There is a dedicated track on the beach, which is very impressive. Check-in at the front desk was also very fast. It was the peak season and there were many people in the lobby. The butler Sea.N contacted me in advance to ask about my room arrangement requirements. The service was very user-friendly. I will choose here again next time I stay, the butler service is very good. The room has a small balcony, and I was lucky enough to see the fireworks on the beach. Very pleasant stay experience.

The sea view from the lobby bar terrace is particularly beautiful. It‚Äôs also great for taking photos. Excellent location. Here you can not only enjoy the beautiful scenery of the seaside, but it is also very convenient to go out for meetings and work. It only takes ten minutes to take a taxi. This time I came to catch up with the Chinese New Year, and the red lanterns in the hotel were also very a**ospheric and festive. The hotel service is also very good, warm and thoughtful. Knowing that I needed to go out for a meeting, I thanked Joan for helping me arrange a room closer to the lobby, which was convenient. Although there is no upgrade, it is very considerate.

The hotel also provides free travel photography. Very good attitude towards travel photography. The young man David at the front desk was nice and even gave us sunscreen and children's picture books. The manager on duty, Fanny, was very nice and arranged the room. We had a lot of luggage, and the young man Blue at the concierge helped deliver the luggage to the room. It was very helpful and the children were very happy. So considerate and considerate. Very good value for money. The weather in Haikou is very comfortable at this time. It is in the 20s. You can have a buffet at the hotel in the evening. It is very rich. You can also go for a stroll in the nearby Yuanda Plaza, which is convenient for shopping.

It‚Äôs really wise to choose Sheraton this time, the view is great and the venue
It's huge, right on the west coast beach Q
Here, it is very close to the estuary of Wuyuanhe National Wetland Park. It was also fun to ride a shared bicycle to the other side. It was easy to ride to the iron bridge for a while. What was also fun was that there was a bus stop at the door. It was also very pleasant to take the Haikou bus. Although it was a bit cold and I couldn‚Äôt go into the water, the scenery was great and the photos were great. I was satisfied!

msg:Facilities: The hotel is quite old and is on the beach. It is understandable that it is a bit outdated. However, the room I stayed in for the first time cost RMB 51.09 million. It was said to be an upgrade from a garden room to a sea view room. The sea view is probably like sticking your head out of the balcony and you can vaguely see the sea in the distance. I got full marks for this reading comprehension question. The facilities are as shown in the picture, which is just a part of it. The smell was very strong when I first entered the room. I thought it would be like this at the seaside, but Later, when I changed rooms, I found out that the problem was with this room. The folding door connecting the bathroom to the bedroom bed may have a badly rusted door shaft, and it was very difficult to open and close. At first, the air conditioner thought it was because the balcony door into the room was open, so I didn't turn it on. After coming down, I tidied up, turned on the air conditioner, closed the balcony door and drew the curtains, and went out to play. However, when I came back at night, it was still too hot. The master who worked hard to repair the air conditioner came to fix it in the middle of the night. In the end, the master said that it might not be repairable in a short time. They also specially contacted the front desk to help us change rooms as soon as possible.
Hygiene: Some parts of the countertop were not wiped clean, but that may be because the room was really terrible. I changed to a decent sea view room on the 4th floor and it was okay.
Environment: The appearance of the hotel and the beach behind it are still okay. When ordering takeout, there is a dining cabinet on the left side of the hotel door. It is very convenient. It is okay for a pure vacation, provided that the room is suitable.
Service: Basically, the attitude of the waiters I encountered was very polite. Aji, who moved the luggage, was very chatty and had cute glasses when I changed rooms. The guy from the Northeast and the guy who was cleaning the pool by chance were all very nice. Nice~ But when I checked out and reported various problems in room 5109 to the front desk, especially the air conditioning problem, even the repairman who came to fix it said that it was indeed very problematic and would take a long time to fix before asking us to change rooms as soon as possible, but the front desk guy said that it might be because of the problem. Does everyone feel different? ? ? This is not the first time I have stayed at a Sheraton across the country. I have refuted customer feedback even though there is factual basis for it. I really did not expect such a service attitude.
Regarding the series of problems encountered during this stay regarding the complimentary room upgrade when booking, it is really puzzling. My friend asked me whether it would not be so bad if I did not upgrade? I'm also very curious. First of all, in addition to the problems mentioned above, I was a little hungry when I got to the room. The front desk said that the room has a menu and you can order directly. The guy who moved the luggage helped us look for it for a long time and couldn't find it. We called the guest room and said it would be there. It was delivered as soon as possible. After waiting for a long time, a blue book was delivered. Except that there was no menu, other safety instructions were quite complete. I called the front desk again to ask, and they were transferred directly to the restaurant. The restaurant asked us to order over the phone, but we didn't have a menu. Okay. ! In the end, the restaurant brought the menu and ordered it on the spot, which was really frustrating!
If Haikou wants to develop, it should also pay attention to these things, otherwise the experience will not be improved for a long time. In short, I will not dare to choose this hotel next time I come to Haikou for something. If you are not satisfied with the room, please remember to change it as soon as possible. Room now!

When you walk out of Sheraton Haikou, you can see the beach. The sand is very soft and comfortable to step on. In mid-December, there were not many tourists in Haikou, and there were not many people staying in Haikou, so it was relatively relaxed and did not feel crowded. . It is an old five-star hotel, so we feel that many of its facilities are aging. The hotel is also being repaired every day, and there is construction at the door, which is a bit noisy. Our room was a little damp on the second floor, and the water seeped in a little slowly, but the service was very good. No matter what request you made, the hotel's response was very fast, and everyone they met would say hello to you, and their attitude was perfect. Five stars. Ôøº

Thank you to the housekeeping staff for your attentiveness. When we pass by each room in the morning and see the housekeeping staff, they always say to us politely: Hello morning!
The only thing that the room facilities are not perfect is that the shower room door is leaking, causing water to seep out of the ground. It is very inconvenient to enter and exit the room, especially if there are elderly people! Pictures 8 and 9 show the gap in the shower room door.

msg:I didn't plan to book a Sheraton before I came here. I was worried that there wouldn't be much food around, and that the airport was a bit far (40 kilometers). So I chose the Sheraton at the last minute because I was attracted by its proximity to the sea. After checking in, I made the right choice. Haikou still requires 2 nights. If you live by the sea, this is a development area and there are really not many people. The housekeeper will contact you thoughtfully before you check in. You will also get CDF duty-free shop coupons when you check in. After all, it is very close...

For meals, you can go to the Yuanda Shopping Center 3 kilometers away...

I don't know whether it's because it's close to the sea or it took too long to build, but there's always a strong musty smell in the room, and even turning on the air conditioner to ventilate it has no effect.

The service staff has a good attitude and responds to questions enthusiastically and proactively. They are very considerate. Special thanks to Manager Sam who checked in at the front office. He was able to arrange a room for check-in at 11 o'clock during the holidays. There was no need to wait for a room. The children's amenity bag prepared was very surprising. I will choose to stay here again.

msg:There were quite a lot of people during the holidays, so I had to wait for about 20 minutes when checking in. I guess some of them arrived early because they read the reviews and were afraid of the long queue time. However, when we arrived early, the room was not cleaned properly. Instead, we got up early to catch the evening market, which caused dissatisfaction. This was the case with the lady in front of me, who complained even after the quarrel for a long time.
Because the normal check-in time was delayed, the guy at the front desk gave two children breakfast as a giftüëçThe breakfast was so rich, I was afraid of being full, so I could only take one piece of each and try it. The hotel swimming pool is very good, and the beach is just three or two minutes walk away. The travel photography provided by the hotel recommends taking pictures early in the morning. There are almost no people on the beach, and the results are great! Have the entire beach to yourself. The photo effects are very nice and it is a beautiful trap. I gave away five and spent more than 300 on the remaining ones, but it left me with unforgettable memories and it was worth it!
It is recommended to go to Haida Nanmen Night Market on the Internet, but the taxi ride costs 100 oceans which is quite far. When we arrived at People Mountain People Sea, we didn‚Äôt miss any of the local snacks recommended by netizens. We only left stinky tofu, grilled squid, and spicy hotpot. You don‚Äôt need to try these must-have snack street snacks, they are all the same.

msg:I especially want to praise the service at the Sheraton Hotel. Our whole family, including the old and the young, checked into the hotel on 10.1. Maybe it was due to the season, but the first room had a musty smell, so I asked the hotel to change the room. The person who received us was Guo Qiuyu, the front office manager. She was very patient and took us to the second room. We said it still had a bit of a musty smell and the child had allergies, so we might not be able to stay there for four days. She arranged for us to wait for a while, and then found several alternative rooms. She went to the rooms to help us select them, selected two rooms, and then let us go to the rooms to check out the choices. In the end, we chose a sea view room, which was obviously more expensive than the room we originally booked, but she changed our room for free without saying anything. During the whole process, she ran up and down several times, always smiling and very patient. I could feel her sincere desire to help us find a satisfactory room without any fuss. She also found us a dehumidifier and air purifier. They also helped us move another room to an adjacent room for the convenience of our family. We originally planned to stay only until the 4th, but because of Ms. Guo's warm and thoughtful service, we decided to adjust our arrangements and continue to stay at the Sheraton for 3 days. We had a great time and felt like we would be taken care of if we had any problems, so we didn't have to worry. Ms. Guo was also very attentive. She learned that our suitcase lever was broken and asked the engineering depar**ent to repair the suitcase lever. It is really rare to have such a spirit of service. We hope that Ms. Guo will continue to help other customers in need just like she helped us. I hope the hotel management can cherish and encourage such employees (Ms. Guo may be a manager herself). Hope other hotel staff can learn from her.

Liu Yi, the hotel sales manager, also helped us arrange check-in and extension during our personal vacation. They also followed up with us on how we felt during our stay. I heard by chance that children like coconut milk, so we specially arranged to give them coconut milk and ice cream. The children were very happy and kept praising Manager Liu! grateful!

I would also like to commend Kuang Aijiao from the housekeeping depar**ent on the 5th floor. She always responded to our requests. We are always provided with patient and attentive service for all kinds of trivial requests, whether old or young. Thank you!

There are also service staff at the hotel's Jade Palace restaurant, service staff at the Western restaurant, etc... Everywhere we went in the hotel, every employee was very good.

thank you all! Because of you, we had a great holiday! We will come again next time and hope to meet these excellent Sheraton employees and experience your excellent service!

msg:Room: The mattress is very comfortable, worthy of five stars. It's a little more comfortable than Jin Ke'er's original intention at home. The pillows are also quite comfortable. It should be a mixture of duck and goose down, and the sound insulation is very good. The only drawback is that there is no free laundry room.
Hotel facilities: There are 3 swimming pools and 2 small hot springs. Two of the swimming pools are not deep enough for children to play, and there are also fun slides. But the water quality is quite average, and the big swimming pool is sometimes not deep enough. The beach is nice, but you can't go into the sea. If you want to go to the sea, you can go to the Holiday Inn next to it. During the day, you can play in the children's pool when the sun is strong, and after 4 pm, you can play on the beach. There are quite a lot of parent-child activities, including tug-of-war in the water, kite flying, balloon folding, etc. The kite flying is on the beach, which is quite sunny during the day, and the kite is very small and has a short string. It is recommended that you buy a better kite yourself and go to the beach after 5 p.m. Play. The travel photography provided was average, and the photos were seriously overexposed. You could only choose 5 photos. If you add one, it costs 30 yuan.
Food: The food in the Chinese restaurant is very average and expensive, and the price/performance ratio is too low. I recommend the Hongyange Restaurant next door, which is very cost-effective at about 90 per person. The breakfast and dinner buffets are slightly better, breakfast is 100 per person, the bread and buns are delicious, and the soy milk and milk are okay. Dinner is 210 yuan per person, and a hairy crab is given to each person during the National Day. It is less expensive than the Westin buffet, but 100 yuan cheaper per person. Beef, mutton skewers, shrimps, etc. are okay, the Westin National Day is 298 per person, and I haven't seen foie gras yet, the price/performance ratio is too low.
Service: Needless to say, the service is pretty good.

msg:Air ticket prices have plummeted during the National Day, so a quick trip to Haikou begins! It has been 6 years since I last visited Haikou. For a leisurely vacation, I chose the Sheraton Hotel, which covers the entire west coast, for this trip. Before departure, the housekeeper sister Alei took the initiative to add me on WeChat to communicate with me about my check-in needs. The holiday coincided with my child's birthday. After communicating with Ale, I prepared a birthday cake and decorated the room for my child. I would like to express my special thanks. The moment the child entered the room, he was stunned by the scene in front of him, and his surprise was beyond words. During the four days we stayed, the housekeeper provided us with meticulous service. It could be said that she was always on call, including a chicken drumstick. Check-in at the hotel is quick, and families with children will receive children's toiletries and gifts. The room size is acceptable, the bathroom is separated from wet and dry areas, the balcony has good lighting and you can see the beach. The Chinese restaurant in the hotel tastes very authentic. I had three lunch and dinner meals. The buffet restaurant has a variety of varieties and reasonable prices. Discount coupons will be given upon check-in, which can be used for dining in the hotel. The hotel has a three-lane swimming pool and a children's pool equipped with water slides. Walking out of the hotel is the West Coast (Hawaii Beach). The beach is made of artificially filled fine sand. The advantage is that the sand is fine and does not hurt your feet. The disadvantage is that there are less marine life and not many types of sea creatures. The beach is in a stocked state, there are not many tourists, the beach is flat, there is a lot of cement and sand in the sea, and there are no lifeguards.

The room facilities are outdated, the breakfast is average, and it is inconvenient to go to attractions and eat in the city (take a taxi (At least 50 yuan per trip). The quilt on the bed was slippery, and there was a lot of garbage at the bottom of the outdoor slide pool. I can only say it was average. I moved to another hotel after staying for two nights.

The bathroom was very humid, but the air conditioner did not have a dehumidification function, so the room felt hot and humid. The hotel is facing a public beach.

Special praise to my housekeeper Alei! The service is super good! Think of everything for me! When I checked in, I was transferred from the side sea view room to the front sea view room on the highest floor. I arranged two rooms very close to each other to take care of the elderly. I also gave the children a complete set of toiletries and a duck toy for soaking in the bathtub. The children were very happy! There was a typhoon the next day, and the hotel and the housekeeper, Alei, were amazing! The hotel has done flood protection in advance, and issued reminder sheets to each room, reminding not to go out and close the balcony doors and windows, etc. The housekeeper Alei also sent a WeChat message to remind me to pay attention! I got sunburned during the trip, and the housekeeper, Alei, saw my Moments and prepared sunscreen for me and put it at the front desk for me to pick up. It was so heartwarming, and he even gave me coconuts and fruits. The hotel is beautiful. There is a standard swimming pool, a shallower swimming pool and water slides for children, as well as a paddling pool and a large slide. We play for hours every day. We are so happy! There are also hot springs, there are several pools. A few hundred meters away from the hotel is the trail, the beach and the sea opposite. One morning we went to catch crabs early in the morning, and we actually caught a few of them. When the sun was out in the sun, the sky was very blue and the sea was blue-green, which was very beautiful. In addition, the hotel‚Äôs red houses, stretches of coconut groves and swimming pools were very good. The hotel also has summer parent-child activities, two in the morning and two in the afternoon every day. We signed up for parent-child activities when we were not playing in the water, such as making coconut cakes and music bubble parties in the water. The children were very happy, and I took many photos for him. The hotel's buffet breakfast and buffet dinner are also good. There are many varieties of food and drinks, combining Chinese and Western... Especially the dinner, this time it is the theme of crayfish. We ate a lot, and we also drank beer, as well as barbecue, seafood, etc. The ice cream is super delicious. There is also a resident singer. The female lead singer and the male play the guitar. The hotel also has a shuttle bus to the duty-free shop, which is very convenient. All the service staff in the hotel are very polite, and they greet us when they see us! The room is large and the bedding is very comfortable! The air conditioner is powerful and cool! The balcony is also very big. In short, I highly recommend the Sheraton Hotel. It‚Äôs so cool to bring a baby, and the price is very good even in summer! Will come again if there is a chance!

Not to mention the remote location
From the door to the hotel facilities, the whole thing reveals a sense of age, maybe it was glorious in the past.
Only the lobby looks good, and the overall appearance looks good, with a Southeast Asian style.
But in Haikou, with more than 400 people, you don‚Äôt need any bicyclesüö≤

Environment: The hall is filled with a stuffy aroma, which my husband said is like puppy shower gel. Every corner of the infrastructure is mediocre.
Hygiene: Not very good, just passable. Our balcony was full of messüåø. One side of the balcony sliding door was fixed, so it was easy to bump into it. There was a lot of dust in the door cracks.
Facilities: The trash cans in the room are not bagged. The children's water park is very simple. There is a pool with more facilities but it is not open. I was shocked by the hot spring pool. It was just two small pavilions of four to five square meters. It didn't matter if we didn't have one.
Service: There is a saying that the service is the best. The little brother will guide us into the room and introduce the direction of the swimming pool. The front desk proactively provided children's toiletries as gifts. A plate of welcome fruit was given as a gift ü•≠
The price/performance ratio is pretty good. It's close to Haikou International Duty Free City and far from the airport. It's suitable for self-driving and transit stays.

It doesn‚Äôt matter if you don‚Äôt upgrade, and you shouldn‚Äôt. Who knows that there are only four or five customers in the lobby by 2.30 , When I checked in, it was normal to say that the room was not available. I booked 2 rooms, so I ordered it as soon as possible. I thought I could check in at 3 o'clock. My husband went to ask at 3 o'clock and said that it was not yet, and there was no answer when I asked. Response, I went to the front desk to ask at 3.30, the woman at the front desk was very impatient and asked me to line up, I said I asked when the room would be ready to line up, and then she just left, really annoyed, and then it was the one who checked us in The man came over and gave me a room, went up and waited for another one and waited until 4.30. Alas, I can‚Äôt speak, and then the man apologized by sending fruit to us. Big brother, there was fruit in the previous check-in, which makes people feel like it‚Äôs just a gift. We also sent coconuts before. Who wants your fruit? Do it well. I don't need anything, the room is arranged above the basketball court, I don't care, obviously there are not many people today because of the occupancy rate. Anyway, I was very disappointed this time. The breakfast and dinner were worse than before, and there were very few items. When I was leaving today, a female manager called Huang Lei contacted me. Her tone of voice was very satisfying. Then she saw us in the lobby and apologized to us. I hope that other people can be like her, so that everyone will have less trouble. , We want to be normal when we stay in the hotel, and hope to train other employees well. This time, we have been here for 7 days, Sheraton Haitang Bay, Xinglong Hilton, and Haihua Island Hilton. Only you make the experience of staying in the worst.

Transportation: The hotel is close to the west coast, so it is very convenient to travel by bus, and take a taxi very quickly, but the surrounding shopping and eating are 2 kilometers away. The hotel is good. If you need to visit scenic spots, you need to take a bus or take a taxi. It takes a long time~

2. A**osphere: There are singing performances in the hall at night, praise. Walking along the beach at night is very pleasant, and the scenery is also great. Although it is much worse than Sanya, the price is also different.
3. Disadvantages: There are a little less children's programs, the swimming pool is not very big, and there is still one under maintenance.
Overall, I am very satisfied and will stay again next time

msg:The room is a bit old, upgraded to a sea view room, the service is very good. I suggest that it is inconvenient to not have a trash can next to the toilet. The washbasin is a bit small, and the water likes to splash on the floor. It would be better if the breakfast includes two hours in other hotels. Because it is a summer vacation, there are only two breakfasts. It is a bit extra for children. Is it cost-effective? I suggest you learn how to add it to the room rate, but I hope it doesn‚Äôt go too far. Although the unit price of the Mission Hills Hotel is expensive, it is still very cost-effective to include two big, two small, two breakfasts and two nights, so you can still spend in the hotel . You can order takeaway, but you have to pick it up yourself, but I don‚Äôt understand that you need to pay rent for swimming laps when you stay in the hotel‚Äôs swimming pool. Many hotels use it for free. Generally speaking, it‚Äôs good, and it‚Äôs close to the beach, but I hope to listen to opinions and do better.

The corridors are hollowed out and very hot without air conditioning. The so-called parent-child paradise is just a climbing mat.

As a result, the front desk directly upgraded us to a big bed suite on the top floor. Then I was afraid that we would not be able to sleep well with our two children, so they gave us an extra bed. My friends and they booked the same room type as we had previously booked, a twin room. There are also two children, and the front desk directly added an extra bed. Really human.

After all, there are hot springs and various regulated swimming pools and water facilities, and the key point is that it is also close to the beach (although it is not included in the scope of the hotel, but the distance and privacy are no different from private beaches), which should be the only one in the whole Haikou Alright. As for the old facilities and so on, there is no way to do it, and it is within an acceptable range. It is also worth mentioning the service of the old high-end hotel! Good service is not just warm, but also professional and effective. Meals are also ok, I have eaten lunch and dinner in the hotel, and the taste is unmistakable! Finally, thanks to my hotel service butler Ale Lesly! From check-in to after-sales after check-out, not only enthusiasm, but also attention to point. A very satisfying experience!

This is a satisfactory stay. I have stayed in all the Marriott series in Haikou. Although the hardware of this hotel is old in comparison, it is my favorite!
Location: The hotel is located on the west coast. I personally think that the sea view and the convenience of going to the beach for running and lounging are better than Haikou Marriott, and it is a slow vacation style.
Decoration: The hardware of this hotel can be seen to be old, but the maintenance is not bad. The room has the feeling of a Sheraton car store in the United States. The interior environment of the hotel is full of resort feeling. The garden and swimming pool landscape are well maintained, and it is very comfortable to wander around in the hotel .
Swimming pool: There are several swimming pools. The rectangular main swimming pool and the hot spring pools on both sides have a good experience. The water quality is good. The service from the butler, Sean, is very good. I contacted by phone before check-in, added WeChat, and arranged the room in advance , highly recommended

The room does have a musty smell. The children don't want to change rooms. I keep opening the balcony door to ventilate. The next night, there is basically no smell. Don't worry about mosquitoes. There is almost no personal test. There is electronic mosquito repellent liquid in the room, and I was not bitten during the period. Apart from the dampness, the musty smell has a lot to do with the incomplete cleaning. For example, the air outlet of the air conditioner can see black mold with the naked eye. The air conditioner is too full and cannot be adjusted. If you have a baby, you have to turn it off in the middle of the night. All three meals are settled in the hotel. There is a resident singing at the Yefeng Restaurant buffet in the morning and evening. Lunch is at the Yugong Chinese Restaurant. The children especially like the young ladies in the Yugong Chinese Restaurant. They are very attentive to the children, gentle, gentle and lovely. The hotel has a series of simple parent-child activities. I like picking coconuts the most. I learned about the life of coconuts.

The adult swimming pool must wear a swimming cap, and there is a small hot spring pool next to it. A 5-minute walk across the swimming pool is the beach. The beach is very wide. Swimming is not recommended in this sea area. It‚Äôs too hot to go at this time. Basically, I go to the beach at 6 o‚Äôclock in the morning to dig and dig, and come back to catch up on sleep at 8 o‚Äôclock. Soak in the pool in the evening.

When I arrived at 4pm, it was already dark when I changed the room. The room I changed in the middle did not have a sea view and the room opposite was being renovated. It's getting worse. In the third room, you can clearly hear the decoration downstairs of the hotel. Turn on the video and listen to the crisp sound of the electric drill. You can't even sleep in in the morning. It's understandable that the decoration is old and the facilities are broken and not repaired. In front of the sink When I used it, I found that the small mirror was broken, and at the buffet, the lamb chops couldn't be chewed, not to mention the seafood, the shellfish were so small, and the salmon wanted to be locked in the safe. You have to pay for this dish as soon as it is served. Are the guests staying in the hotel afraid that you will run away? Are all restaurants outsourced? The accommodation and food are very poor, and the service is non-existent.

Maybe it's because of the proximity to the sea. When I first checked in, I felt that the room had a damp smell.

It was cold and I didn‚Äôt have the chance to enjoy the swimming pool. I tried the hot springs and the service from the hot spring depar**ent was considerate and thoughtful. Our room has a large terrace. When we arrived on the first day, the child was standing on the terrace and saw a squirrel in the grass below. He was very surprised. The beach at the hotel is beautiful and the sand is very fine. The hotel is close to the Wetland Park and can be reached within walking distance. The Wetland Park is large and suitable for hiking. The reeds are beautiful. We also saw groups of cattle, sheep and many birds. When I took my children in Haikou, I also went to the Crater, the Arcade, and the Swan Lake Animal Base. I also had good food in Hainan, such as Eastern goat, coconut chicken, seafood, etc. But the restaurant names are a bit funny, chicken rice restaurant, duck rice restaurant... The only shortcoming of this trip Even the round trip flight was delayed by nearly two hours...

msg:I stayed here five years ago, because I had a very good impression of the environment and service at that time, so I chose the Sheraton without hesitation this time. I just want to say: there is no harm if there is no comparison.
When I checked in, I was given a bunch of cards, and it was a follow-up photo and a duty-free shop. This kind of sales promotion made people very annoying before they checked in.
I was given a paper bag when I checked in with a child. It was called a gift for children, but it was actually the most basic toiletries such as dental kits and shampoo. Isn‚Äôt it the most basic operation for a five-star hotel to provide children‚Äôs products? How did it become a benefit for customers?
There are no children‚Äôs slippers and bathrobes in the room. I asked the room service for them. The first ones delivered were stained as shown in the picture and the slippers were too small. I called to ask for another set. When the waiter came to pick them up, he told him that the robes and slippers were not clean. The waiter didn't say a word, from knocking on the door to picking up the things, he didn't say a word üëçüèª The slippers in exchange were the same size and still couldn't fit. They called again and delivered them again. They were still the same size... For a pair of slippers, give The front desk and room service called several times and delivered three times, but they took three pairs that were exactly the same! ! ! Of course, I didn't get a pair of slippers of the right size in the end, because I didn't call again because I was afraid of affecting my mood.

msg:In terms of the preferred price, it does have an advantage over Sanya. If you simply play on the beach and watch the sea, the price/performance ratio is good. The sandy beach is relatively delicate, but the color of the sea is cloudy.
Secondly, the service area can be said to be more differentiated. First of all, I am satisfied. The next floor of the room is just at the entrance of the gym. The younger brothers and younger sisters here are very enthusiastic. Every time they go downstairs, they will greet each other warmly and ask if they want to give directions. One younger brother in particular is full of enthusiasm, which makes people feel happy. I feel like guests are at home. What I am dissatisfied with is that the check-in business at the front desk is unfamiliar and my speech is stuttering... Then the description of the deposit is as follows. I saw that your room comes with a dinner and breakfast package. So here we charge you a deposit of 2,500. When I asked why I had to charge a deposit larger than the two-night room rate since I brought my own package, the young lady suddenly said, can you accept 2,000? I feel like I'm shopping for groceries, and I'm not answering a channel's question. Then when I asked if I could see if there was a room with a better view, the lady said that the room with a better view was arranged for you (PS: Picture 2 is the sea view room I ordered, and the lady helped me choose the view on the third floor The rooms are relatively good, the sea view room is rather tasteless, it is better to book a relatively cheap garden room). The most incomprehensible thing for me is that at two o'clock in the evening, the waiter knocked on the door three times to deliver the goods. He was so frightened that he delivered the goods to the wrong room. This is the first time I have lived in a hotel for so long...
Room: The room is very clean, although the facilities are a bit old for a long time. There are mosquitoes every night. We try not to go out to the balcony. It is estimated that the mosquitoes were in the room before check-in
Meals: There are no fried vegetables for dinner. Although there are not many other varieties, they are enough. The breakfast variety is relatively monotonous, and I can't choose anything after looking around. There is a coconut cake that is quite unique.
Location: It is relatively far from the airport and the urban area. It is recommended to stay in the urban area for one night before visiting the scenic spots

The sea view room was too loud and the two old people didn't sleep well all night. The next day, I went to the front desk to explain the situation and immediately adjusted the room.

On the way, I heard the driver said that the Sheraton is not a new hotel, but after arriving, I feel that everything is great. Since the main building is under construction, we wanted to be quieter, so we arranged a room with a side sea view. From the time we arrived at the hotel and then checked in, there were people who helped us with our luggage and opened the door. All the staff were very friendly. The room was clean, bright and well-decorated. It's not old and the shower is very smooth. And there are swimming pools and hot springs inside the hotel, which are super comfortable. We originally planned to stay in Haikou for a few days before going to Sanya. The tickets for Sanya were all booked, but the experience of staying in Sanya was very good, so we canceled the plan to stay in Sanya for a few more days, and because of my personal reasons, it was a bit difficult to order takeaway. Food poisoning, the hotel also sent us light food to be delivered to the room, in short, it is a great hotel, if I go to Haikou next time, I will definitely go to Sheraton again.

Hotel swimming pools and hot spring pools have a limit on the number of times they can enter the venue. Those who stay in the hotel usually don‚Äôt limit it like this. Atlantis is an unlimited number of times. As a result, the number of times the hotel‚Äôs internal hot spring pools and swimming pools are limited is not satisfactory at all. .

Secondly, the hardware of the hotel is aging, and the sanitation is a bit poor, especially on the balcony, there is dust everywhere, and the sanitation is not satisfactory.
The hotel's service attitude is relatively hard, which is not ideal. Then, I informed in advance that I brought children, and did not prepare children's toiletries, slippers, etc.
The overall impression is 4 points, mainly because the environment is good, and the other items are deduction items.

msg:This hotel is the worst hotel I have encountered in my travels in the past 20 years! I arrived at 1:30 on the first day of check-in and told me that the room was not available. OK, I will give you time. I went out for two hours and came back. The room card was not made at all, so I waited again. The sea view room you booked will only give you a small glimpse of the sea. We coordinated to change the room. They said they were cleaning it and had to wait. Then they ignored you. Four hours later, at around 7 p.m., I contacted you. They said they could move to an upstairs room, and then moved a bunch of luggage to another room without any help from the waiter. When you finished taking a shower and went to bed, you found that the room had not cooled down for a long time. My dear, the air conditioner was not cooling. For the first time, I called a technician and adjusted the fan blades. He said it was okay and left. After an hour, the temperature still hadn't dropped at all, so I called the front desk again, and the solution they gave was to bring a fan, or to exchange the double bed for a double bed, which would have to be moved again. It was already 12 o'clock in the middle of the night. I really didn't want to go through the trouble anymore, so I just got a fan and made do for one night without any compensation. In a fit of anger, I canceled everything in the next few days and changed my booking to go home. The travel experience in Haikou is so bad!

You can soak in the hot spring to warm up after swimming in winter. The gym is amazing, but only used it once. The hotel is very close to the beach with fine sand. The beauty in the gray uniform at the front desk served very well and specially arranged the room for us.

msg:The hotel is located on the west coast of Haikou, with excellent scenery along the way. It was a bit late to arrive at the hotel, but the check-in at the front desk was very professional. A manager at the front desk, Qin Bowen, specially helped to upgrade the room. In any case, it is definitely touching to have such a service during the Spring Festival. In fact, I dare not expect extravagantly during the Spring Festival)
When I arrived at the room, I was pleasantly surprised. The view was good, the room was clean and tidy, and the garden was surrounded by lush greenery. I was in a particularly good mood.
There are a lot of people for breakfast, and the overall dishes are rich. The price during the Spring Festival is definitely worth it. Staying in Sanya is a crowd, but the food here is definitely more worthwhile than Sanya. There was steak for breakfast. In particular, after checking in, I went to the snack street of the hotel. It was refreshing and delicious. The manager surnamed Wang introduced that the vine is made of plants. Haha, the name is a bit strange when I hear it for the first time, but the taste is also very nice.
The overall stay is very pleasant. When waiting for the room, the super-large LED display shows that the management level is comprehensive! Full marks for thumbs up! Thank you for the hard work of the staff during the Spring Festival, and I will come again next time.

I wanted to cancel the order, but the hotel didn't agree. The hotel room was old and smelled bad. I had rhinitis after one night, so I checked out and ran away early in the morning. Why is the hotel rated so low? It‚Äôs not unreasonable! The whole hotel has an old and dilapidated feel. The rooms are not that good, and the swimming pool is full of moss. Dirty is a word. The operator can renovate it! The only reason I came here to stay was because there was a beach right outside the hotel. I thought it would be convenient to take my kids to the beach, so I booked it for one night. The hotel's catering is quite rich, but the ingredients are not that high-end. The variety is okay and it's OK. Let‚Äôs talk about the service, which is uneven. Some staff members will take the initiative to say hello, while others are indifferent. Does your hotel‚Äôs work depend on your mood? When checking out this morning, a staff member with a four-letter name at the front desk said goodbye with a smile! without! have! He looks so bad!

During the Spring Festival, we stayed at the hotel for 6 days in Haikou. Because the whole family traveled with two babies, the hotel helped to change the business car to pick up the airport very early. The girl who helped check in smiled very kindly! The children's playground is a bit small, and the water park is not available in winter, but it is very close to the beach, the beach sand is very fine, and the coast is very wide, children like it very much! !

Disadvantage: I made several phone calls from the five-star hotel within two days and no one answered? ? This is the first time I have lived in so many hotels. The hotel lobby and room decoration are really dilapidated. I read that Ctrip wrote about the 2016 decoration, it should not be. It has been renovated for more than ten years. The hotel basically has no services at all... The Westin Hotel I stayed in for the next few days is recommended. The decoration is relatively new. The front desk took the initiative to upgrade the river view room. The front desk and room service are excellent.

Coastal sea view, swimming pool, hot spring, SPA center, western restaurant, Chinese restaurant, children's play center, etc., have everything you need. Due to the relatively long construction time, the internal details of the hotel rooms may still need to be optimized, but it does not affect the living experience. The attitude of the hotel service staff is also very nice. The most satisfying thing is the sea view that comes with the hotel. The photos are very good. There are different scenery at different times of the day. It should be the best part of Haikou. Overall, the living experience this time is still very good.

msg:You say it is not good, it meets everything in the introduction, you say it has everything, it needs you to remind you of everything. The booked room type can be upgraded to a sea view, and then a Ctrip room upgrade privilege is superimposed. After arriving, it is said that it cannot be superimposed and upgraded. It was the child's birthday on the day of check-in, so I said hello in advance, saying that there will be birthday decorations and cakes. After arriving, first of all, as shown in the picture, this is his sea view room, with a faint sea view on the side, accompanied by the rumble of decoration. There is no birthday arrangement, so I put a stone bracelet. It took about an hour after the communication to re-arrange. As for the cake, at the beginning it said four hours, that is, six o'clock. As a result, I called after six o'clock, and it was not ready until eight o'clock. Oh, by the way, the hot water faucet in the sink is still a little leaky, and the rolls of paper in the bathroom on the first day of stay are obviously used. When I went out and came back the next day, I was locked out of the room and couldn't get in. It took ten minutes for someone to open the door after the phone call. As a veteran hotel owned by Marriott, I am a little disappointed.

Returning from urban areas such as old streets or night markets basically requires a taxi fare of 30+
2. The beach is under maintenance, so the selling point of this sea view is lost

msg:Let's talk about the location first: along the coast, it takes half an hour to drive to the city, and Zhou is not too developed, so it is suitable for self-driving or pure hotel exclusive. There are not many parking spaces in the hotel, and it is a little tight at night.
Environment: The overall facilities are a bit older, but the tone of the old five-star is still there, the exterior is a bit older, and the interior decoration is okay. All neat and tidy. There is a runway along the coast, but it is still being repaired, unfortunately. The only thing to complain about is that the so-called sea view rooms are all 30-45 degrees of sea view from the side, and they are all facing the woods. The 5th floor can barely see a little more sea, and the 4th floor and below basically just look at the woods.
Swimming pool: It is very clean, but the temperature in Haikou in January is 15-22 degrees, which is still a bit cold. There are two small hot spring pools (artificial) next to the swimming pool, which can be used to warm up.
Not much variety for breakfast.

When checking in at 2 or 3 o'clock, it was said to upgrade the floor, but the cleaning would have to wait until 4:30;
3. The first time I entered, the two cards were invalid, and I kept saying that I must have put it together with the mobile phone;
4. The breakfast table is cleaned and floated on the surface;
I endured all the above and didn't say anything until I saw this children's paradise. I took my child to live in a place so far away from you. Would you give me this? I asked a staff member that there is something wrong with this children's playground, but the other party said "the children are too lethal now"...
One thing to say, after passing the feedback, the manager on duty handled it professionally, apologized, sent afternoon tea, and arranged for the staff to set up a children's-themed tent in the room.
5 points for the manager on duty and 0 points for the hotel.
A hotel that deducts points from the "Marriott" and "Sheraton" brands, I suggest you think twice before booking in the future.

Service: It really surprised me. It can be said that it is the worst five-star hotel I have ever stayed in, and it is not even as good as some boutique hotels in Haikou. Especially the waiter by the pool, the child played in the hot spring for a while, and looked impatiently next to me, and I didn't understand the dialect. And when I said why the slide wasn't open, the waiter scolded me directly, I'm the only one here. Is this an excuse?

All services tell you that they are charged first, and the experience is very bad. Because my aunt came suddenly in the middle of the night, asked the front desk, and asked a male waiter to bring it over with a sanitary napkin. It was embarrassing at that time...

Anyway, it is a hotel that will never come again. The training is not in place, and when you see guests, you will leave with a glance. It is really a very bad hotel! Very bad experience...

msg:The Hotel is very suitable. Luckily for a Sheraton. I paid a little more for a room with a sea view. Indeed, you could see it a little to the right. I think it's a scam.
On the other hand, you shouldn't expect too much from the concierge or reception desk. They were unable to tell me about ferries to return to the mainland. Neither in terms of schedules nor in terms of where to go to get one. I was able to manage otherwise.
The general impression, for a hotel at 150 euros per night, is very reserved. the money is below what we could hope for.

msg:The famous Sheraton was really disappointing.
The first is the environment. Although I have made psychological preparations for the musty smell after reading the comments, it is still a bit unacceptable. Mildew can be seen on the walls and ceilings of the rooms and toilets on the 5th floor. There was a musty smell on the bed and the quilt was always damp. It was uncomfortable to sleep, and the quilt at the end of the bed was actually dragged to the ground. It looked really dirty and dirty! The material of the quilt cover is a bit slippery, similar to satin, and some of it has been pilled and silky. The touch is really hard to describe. Even if the air conditioner does not cool and does not dehumidify, the sound is still very loud. Toiletries smell bad, toothpaste is very cheap, and the bathtub is visibly dirty. All in all, the overall feeling is that it is uncomfortable to live and sleep.
Secondly, I included afternoon tea in the package I bought on Ctrip. It stated that it was one of the two options in the British and South Seas. When I went there on the first day, I told a waitress that I had reserved afternoon tea. We had to show a QR code. I said Where did the QR code come from? She said that you have made a reservation, and I said that I can't find it. First of all, in this case, should the waiter assist the guest to find it instead of standing there? Then I said that I booked a hotel package, and she said oh, then you can choose two drinks. I said, can't I choose one of the whole package? At this time, another waitress came out and said, you who have reserved a room can't choose, and you can only choose two drinks after you have prepared it. I kind of want to fight, but if I think about it, I really forget it. So ok, on the first day, I ate the British afternoon tea that I didn't want to eat and it was really hard to eat.
When I went to eat again the next day, there was a different male waiter. I couldn't help but ask again if I could choose Nanyang, but he immediately said yes, it's a choice between two. so? ? Where did the rules from those waitresses who were there on the afternoon of the 9th come from? Are you still so rude?

The room is soundproof and you can hear the sound of walking. When the door was opened, the air conditioner was already running, making people feel immediately cool down. It seems that the hotel does not care about energy consumption. There is not much introduction to the hotel when checking in at the front desk, and you may wish to let guests explore by themselves. Most of the hotel staff can greet me and answer my questions when they see me. The hotel is close to the sea, and the greenery around the swimming pool is very rich. There is an outdoor platform that resembles a wedding and even feels a little bit down. I don't know if it's taking the cultural route. The gym is equipped with water dispensers and paper cups instead of bottled water. In the afternoon, I ate the pineapple buns at the lobby bar of the hotel for 15 yuan each, which was a big bun. In the evening, I ate the soup with rice in the Chinese restaurant of the hotel, and the dishes felt more down-to-earth. The next day I ate the Sheraton Bun and the crayfish. The big bun looked very big, but the filling was not very satisfying. The crayfish was quite satisfactory. When checking out, a little brother who looked a bit like Deng Lun saw that there were a lot of people at the front desk, so he put away the room card for me to check out.

msg:I booked a sea-view twin room on Ctrip for one night. As shown in Figure 1, there is only so little sea in sight.
In the next three nights, I used Marriott points to exchange for a garden twin room. On the night of check-in, the front desk said that I would change the room the next day. I said that with a child, I could not change it. The front desk said no, or just stay in the garden double bed from tonight, so there is no need to change it. Otherwise, refund the hotel order and place a new order. Later, I had no choice but to agree to a room change the next day. I mentioned that if I change rooms, I hope not to arrange a floor, because I read the evaluation before, and there are insects and mosquitoes on the lower floors, and I am afraid that children will be bitten. The front desk agreed to change to the fourth or third floor of the same floor. Later, I gave two young coconuts.
The next day, we packed up our luggage and waited for the room change, so we didn't go out. No one looked for us in the afternoon. I called the front desk and arranged a room on the 2nd floor for us, and told me that the view was good, facing the swimming pool. Picture 2 is the so-called pool view room. In fact, below is an aisle for entering and exiting the building. The corner of the small pool next to it is a pool outside the restaurant. I can only see one corner. And this room only has the morning sun, and there is no sunlight after noon. Therefore, the room is very humid, and the bedding will always feel undried after washing, especially damp. There is also a slight musty smell inside the house. I didn't want to change rooms anymore and wasted my time, and didn't look for a hotel anymore. The hotel called me the next day and asked how to check in. I said the room was damp and musty. The hotel just said to look back at the room, and there was nothing more. I don't want to be tossing about changing rooms, and finally it's nothing.
The adult swimming pool has a good view, just bask in the sun, without shade. There are two slides in the children's area. They opened at 3 pm and no one played them all the time. I was still wondering. Later, the children said that they were not slippery when they sat on them, so they only played for a while. It may be due to the angle of the slide, and the bottom of the slide is not into the water, but a few stairs.
The hotel garden is not big, the pool view is still beautiful
The hotel does not have a beach, and there is a row of railings and stones along the coast
The hotel‚Äôs western restaurant has a large number of people for breakfast and dinner, and the mobility is also great, so you can basically find a seat. One day I went for breakfast at nine o'clock in the morning, and the pho was gone. I suggest you go early.

The large bathtub in the bathroom makes people want to take a bath. The room on the second floor has a large terrace. It is very enjoyable to drink coffee on the terrace in the morning. The hotel staff are enthusiastic in service. After enjoying the seafood dinner and exquisite western food, you will feel that the price of 10 yuan ice cream in the lobby and 15 yuan a bread is very close to the people.

msg:We live in a garden-view room on the second floor. There is a big terrace where children can play on the terrace. The rooms are very large. The opening time may be relatively early. The decoration style looks a bit retro and the facilities are intact. , There are children‚Äôs play facilities in the swimming pool-the beach is just behind the hotel, and it is a coastline with the holiday beach in Haikou-the hotel is three kilometers away from the holiday beach, not far from the holiday beach if you want to go to the hotel-every day the hotel also has a duty-free shop in the district Free bus ~ good value for money ~

msg:Coming to comment on this unpleasant experience only after the journey is completely over. This is the first time I have given a bad review to a Marriott hotel or even a Sheraton hotel. Arrived at the hotel at 2:30 in the afternoon. The lady at the front desk made 3-4 calls before and after. At 2:46 in the afternoon, we informed us that the room (family suite) is under construction. We asked what construction would affect our stay? She said it's okay to be outdoor. We asked if there are other rooms of the same room type? She said that the rooms of the same room type are on the same floor as you are 1002, and everything is under construction next door. We want to say that we are afraid of disturbing us. So we still can't check in at 3pm, we can only store our luggage to eat. Due to the heavy rain, we did not go back to the hotel to check in until the evening. When we arrived in the room, out of trust in the Marriott brand or even Sheraton, we did not check the room, but directly washed it (for self-entertainment time). I went to bed at 2 in the morning. At 3 in the morning, my girlfriend said it was itchy. Turn on the light and screamed. Many ants were crawling. I immediately jumped up to look at my bed. There were ants under the pillow. Immediately notify the friend in the other room that she has been bitten. We called the front desk immediately, and the staff said when they arrived, how could it happen? We obviously killed it in the afternoon! We asked angrily: So this afternoon is not the construction of insecticide, is it? ? Why conceal it? Why not let me know in advance? The staff immediately pretended to be stupid and said you want to ask the manager, I don't know. After arriving that night, the manager on duty always denied that there was no spray killing. After we repeatedly pressed, she said that I did not know about the daytime affairs and needed to inquire. (There was no sorry sentence within 1 hour.) Later we were very tired. We said that as long as we could sleep, we should arrange a room as soon as possible. We packed our luggage and went to the second floor, opened the door to check, there was still a bed on the pillow. There is no room until 4 in the morning. What is the upgrade to a sea-view room to a presidential room? We don‚Äôt care, we just want to rest, so tired! After my complaint with Ctrip, Ctrip was still concerned about the progress at 9 o'clock, but it was not until 10:30 in the morning that someone said embarrassment and said what you want. We were very angry: 1. We were bitten and there was no oin**ent (I gave Fengyoujing only when I checked out, which I emphasized again and again) 2. After the incident, there was no excuse, or I was sorry for "begging" in the morning. The manager unanimously denied and procrastinated. 3. Before checking in, you even deceived the consumer. What if one of us gets bitten while staying in a family suite? 4. We were very angry when we saw their attitude when we only asked for the check-out fee! Asking for compensation, the manager said that we can't do it, we never do this thing, we are already very good to be free of room charges. (I wonder if I need to be grateful?) In fact, what we want is the sincerity of sorry, because we don't say anything before we want to pay, even if you pay 1 yuan, I will fight to the end! But now we will be compensated according to the requirements of deceiving consumers' rights and interests 3! 5. Such sanitary conditions should be rectified and should not be opened! Affect the corporate image, affect the brand image, summer vacation, how can children be guaranteed for their outings?
We have lodged a complaint with the Health Bureau of the Tourism Bureau, and we will follow up on the situation closely.

msg:The location is not too close to the city center, suitable for coming by car.
The lobby is open and a bit hot, but fortunately there is air conditioning in the check-in area. The guy who checked me in was very enthusiastic, but forgot his name...
The pool is also great, overall the price is good, but the room is a bit small
Stayed for two days and found that the breakfast was good, but it was different every day.

msg:In such a hot city like Haikou, there is no air-conditioning in the hotel lobby. The first impression is bad. There is no air-conditioning in the lobby, corridors, and aisles. It's just that the air-conditioning in the room is also super weak. What disgusted me the most was that there were underwear that did not belong to us in the safe in the room~ No one answered the switchboard all the time. I questioned the hygiene and service of the Sheraton Hotel.

The waiters are warm and polite, especially Ms. Alei at the front desk. The typhoon stayed in the hotel for one day, delayed shopping in the duty-free shop, and extended the check-out time for us, feeling her warmth all the time! The hotel is cost-effective, the first choice for parents and children, recommended!

There is a small garden with coconut trees and banana trees and a winding path leading to it.

There is a hot spring faucet next to it, which is convenient for washing the sand on the feet and hands. liquor
The breakfast in the store is still very rich, and the afternoon tea is also very good. There is a bus to the cdf duty-free shop, which is very close to the sailing base. Special thanks to the housekeeper, Sean, for calling and adding WeChat before check-in. I came with my friends. Because there was a group staying, the room type was quite tight, and then I arranged a room for rest, and changed to a very close room the next day. I left a piece of clothing when I changed rooms, and I contacted the housekeeper, Sean, to arrange for it to be delivered immediately. All in all, it was a great experience to check in, and the service was first-class. It was a very comfortable experience.

The breakfast is quite satisfactory, which is the usual standard of Sheraton, but the tableware and paper towels are missing. Children in the swimming pool like it very much. You can walk along the beach to the entrance of the Wetland Park. But the vegetation in the park really needs to be taken care of, especially the many exposed lawns along the way to the beach in the East District. The two sea view rooms we booked were one order. The front desk told us that the rooms are arranged according to two orders, so the rooms are not on the first floor. After coordination, they were arranged on the first floor. The rooms are different in size. One of them The room is obviously smaller, and the sea view is also blocked by the terrace, which is a little pity. In addition, the hotel has 4 parent-child activities every day, which are quite rich. However, we participated in two activities. One time, no responsible staff came to the scene, and the other time the staff arrived later than the scheduled time. I feel that the tissue cell section needs to be improved.
