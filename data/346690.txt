msg:As always Sunshine Resort in Sanya is like a home always from home...but with better cooking :)
From the warm welcome from Vanessa at the front desk...to all the cleaners, wait staff and pool staff..you are treated as a valued visitor.
It is great to see the extra loung chairs at the pool and on the property above the beach and chairs and umbrellas on the beach...well done.
A big benefit is the newly developed bosrdwalk that goes the entire lenght of the beach with plenty of food and drink.
Also....although I do not have kids here..they always have entertainment on the holidays for the young ones.
I will always return the the special..."Sunshine" in Sanya

msg:The hotel is very old, the room we stayed in definitely needs renovation, and probably so do other rooms. The view is nice, though. The biggest disappointment was ‚Äúprivate beach‚Äù. As the hotel staff pointed out, all the beaches in Sanya are now public, so no private beach whatsoever. The only thing the hotel could offer is a private gate to the beach, which was only open for one day during our stay, then it got closed because of some construction works at the beach. So, to get to the beach, we needed to take a detour through the main street which was awfully inconvenient. Just imagine going all the way back covered in sand and everythingüò° The hotel has two swimming pools, one of them was closed. The other one was fine, no problem here. All in all, the hotel was quite a disappointment, not going back there again.

This hotel is right next time the beach that you exit the hotel at the rear and walk through a security gate and directly on to the beach.  The room was okay with a small balcony to dry your clothes.  I was upgraded for free too.  The breakfast was okay.  Egg station, bacon, sausages.  Selections of European breads, fruits, as well as the more Asian favourites such as noodles. 

There are two swimming pools, and a small play pool for really young kids. The swimming pools are more for lazying around than swimming.  Around the hotel is a seafood bbq street.  McDonalds is directly opposite.  A nice sports bar (FreeGen Sports bar) is located at the rear on the beach. Lawson's and other convenient stores are within a minute or two walking distance. The famous Dolphin bar is a 10 minute walk away. 

If you walk out the hotel and turn left and walk to the end street there is a COVID test station. 15rmb per test. 

I would recommend this hotel.

msg:This is the second time I have stayed at the Sunshine Resort Intime Sanya and it has once again exceeded my expectations. When we arrived we were greeted by the friendly staff at the front desk that were able to care for our luggage until the room was clean. 

Once we got to the room, it was immaculately clean and they even upgraded us to a Sea-View room with a nice balcony. 

Our hotel is centralized among many different restaurants and activities and was very easy to order a DiDi to the hotel. 

The pool was spacious and clean and provided lots of seating, and we were only a two minute walk to the beach. 

Overall, this experience has been wonderful and I recommend anyone looking for a place to stay in Sanya to stay at this wonderful hotel!

In my home country, America, I would honestly hire a lawyer and sue for false advertising. I chose the hotel because so many amazing guest reviews. Clearly fake. I hope and pray this review catches your eyes and you choose another. TERRIBLE room. Ugly hotel. That said the pool and garden are nice. If they advertised as 3 star room with great pool and garden I would be ok. But NEVER in a million years can they say this is 5 stars! I‚Äôm so angry and upset. I may try to find a Chinese lawyer.

msg:This is my second time booking this hotel. The location is probably the best you can get. The breakfast is large with many choices. Beds are comfortable. The grounds are huge with several pools although I didn't use them because they were quite crowded. They have a very nice BBQ dinner buffet outdoors as well as a nice Thai restaurant on the first floor. Check in was very fast even though it is such a big hotel. I would say it is more practical than luxury. Seems like a great option for families. I booked a sea view room but we could only see a small part of sea because one of the buildings was mainly blocking the view. I felt the room cleaning was especially great. And they also have a projector in the room to watch movies. Very comfortable place to live for a few days. Even though I did not enjoy the view it is quite affordable for what you get and I will probably stay here again.  Please note that during this time some of the walkway along the beach is now closed. The first restaurant on the beach is Japanese and has a hula dancing show every Saturday. Highly recommend it üëå

By the other hand the restaurant is good, the rooms are nice and clean, even their balconies kinda very small some of them with half views to other balconies and half the sea, gotta be careful and request a full ocean view. Hotel now it's like 3 to 4 stars.

We appreciated the quick access to the beach and many restaurants with delicious food, however our hotel key cards often didn‚Äôt work for the gate between the hotel and the beach. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. We hope Sunshine hotel can consider a better way of providing drinking water for hotel guests instead of using so many small plastic bottles (380m) There are much better environmentally friendly ways of providing drinkable water to hotel guests.

The staff is helpful especially housekeeper and at the lake restaurant! The concierge Teddy was great too, helping us book tours through town. 
The breakfast buffet was fine, and we think there's a lot of choices for Westerners. At night they set up a BBQ by the lake with much more to offer. Seafood lovers won't be disappointed. 
The package I booked included stay, breakfast and dinner!  
The beach is decently near, and a big PLUs is this hotel's location! Lots of pubs nearby -and near the shore. 
I would like to commend this place for its cleanliness. The ayis do spend time and effort mopping and there's always a nice smell in public areas. 
The hotel has 3 swimming pools and they let guests use floaters and towels for free. 
The reason why I gave 4**** to amenities here is that they don't give all options for toiletries (conditioner and razor set -for example). Also the bathtub is not very high and not comfortable enough for a good shower.

msg:I've just arrived on Sunday 26th Dec, to find that the hotel beach access is closed without prior warning. I had booked here specifically because we usually  walk straight onto the beach and there are hotel loungers and sunshades supplied. (It is not covid-related closure as there are diggers removing buildings.) Reception tells me the government only made this decision this weekend, but this doesn't ring true.
It was also not possible to get a non-smoking room and I'm stuck with the smell. Unfortunately, it is now midnight and I can't leave the window open either because the construction is noisily continuing.
I paid in advance for 6 days of something I'm not getting, but the no refund cancellation policy means I'm stuck.

I always saw a cleaning lady cleaning the common areas, the floors, the fountain on the ground floor.  The hotel is divided into 3 frequent, A, B and C. I had the opportunity to see the rooms in all parts and C is my favorite part.  The hotel rooms are not new, but it doesn't matter at all, because the rooms are clean.  Every day the cleaning lady changes sheets and towels, wipes the floor, empties the baskets.  The hotel has a beautiful garden with one large swimming pool, the second smaller and the third smaller for children.  On the ground floor there is a full restaurant and several stalls where you can buy for 13 ¬• coconut and not leaving the hotel.  The hotel also has a wonderful children‚Äôs corner.  I recommend the hotel for families with children as well as for couples or seniors.

Unfortunately...the beach which is in front of the hotel is pretty much closed off to tourists. Although it was long over due for demolition - the powers that be started the deconstruction Christmas Eve Day...poor timing considering the amount of tourists there for the holiday season.

The beach boardwalk will be under construction  until May.....so...access to the beach will be limited.

I felt there should have been a notice posted by the hotels in the area about the closed beach....That is the only reason I scored service at a 3. Also location 2 because of the closed beach.

The location is great , it is the sea first line with private facilities at the sandy beach . The lifeguard on the beach is on duty from 8 am till 7 pm. The swimming pool is big and clean. Actually, there are 3 swimming pools in hotel, but due to Covid-19 only one swimming pool was open . Breakfast is rich and delicious. Especially, I enjoyed coffee in the morning. The rooms are clean and well equipped. Almost all rooms are rooms with super sea-view. The housekeeping is very enthusiastic. The hotel staff is very polite , helpful and professional. I especially appreciate the assistance at the front desk during check in and check out. The receptionists speak English. The garden is small but nice, green, well-cared and very cosy. Next time I will definitely choose it again  and recommend the Sunshine Intime to my friends! Thank you for service!

All of the hotel common areas are clean and nice. When you step out of the elevator to get to your room there is a very strong smell of cleaning liquid in the corridor and also inside the room. The room is clean at least, but the smell is not nice.
The breakfast buffet is large and fresh, well maintained also when many people are fighting for the same food.
The Thai/Vietnamese restaurant is good, but the menu is small and there are not many seats.

The buffet has chinese and some western option, but everything si very oily, they could improve the menu, maybe with more western dishes, vegetables, less oil and COLD  beer. The location is good cause is centric, in the Dongdahai area, and the public beach is just behind the hotel ( but is not the greatest beach in Sanya). We got upgraded to a suite, very comfortable and big with a small balcony and a really big bed, the downside is that it wasn‚Äôt  soundproof, we could hear voices from the next room and different noises all the time. Lastly the swimming pools are ok, but the water it‚Äôs hot all the time, and no deep area,  family and children oriented. In general I feel this hotel is really good for the price and I can tell that the staff is trying to give the best service they can, but I feel it lacks in comparison of international chains and standards.

That being said, all the staff were friendly and professional, the room was thoroughly cleaned daily, the location was wonderful(a minute to the beach) and the view from the room was beautiful. The downsides were a breakfast buffet that didn‚Äôt even offer fruit juice, let alone meet five star standards, a rather basic and outdated room(not even a bedside lamp and very old AC) and a tired bathroom with a bath that barely drained at all. Despite all this, for the price paid and location, I would stay again and recommend to others‚Ä¶just don‚Äôt expect five star luxury.

The location is great, with a first-line sea view, and it is only a few minutes away from Dadonghai Beach through the hotel's garden. The hotel's service attitude is very good, and the front desk who checked in was very enthusiastic and meticulous. The room was very clean and comfortable, and the bedding was also very comfortable. There are several restaurants in the lobby on the first floor, all of which are famous in Sanya, such as the dregs vinegar coconut chicken hot pot, and there are many places to eat around, which is very convenient. It is very good to spend a vacation here.

I was always worried that the sea view room I booked was not good enough, but the lady at the front desk helped me upgrade the room for free. The view outside the window was really a surprise!
There is also a large swimming pool, and there are always security guards there from 8:30 in the morning to 11:00 at night, so the children can play without worry.
There were also fruits delivered to the room, and I was given an afternoon tea voucher before I left, so I could bring my kids to experience it. It's really great
I'll definitely come next time I come to Sanya!

I didn't expect that the service was not downgraded even though my consumption was downgraded. I came here with my children and upgraded to a parent-child room for free. The water and sand quality of the beach on the hotel are great. There are so many places to eat downstairs, and you can do everything without leaving the hotel with your children. I can honestly say that the service and supporting facilities are not inferior to those of big-name hotels. I will choose Yintai next time I come to Sanya~

It takes only 5 minutes to walk to Dadonghai Beach. The overall decoration of the hotel is more tropical, and it feels very fresh and comfortable! The balcony is full of southern French style. As soon as you open the balcony door, you can see the blue sea. The sea breeze blows on the viewing balcony: it is very comfortable. There is a small door in the hotel garden that leads directly to Dadonghai Beach. The hotel has a rich variety of restaurants, including a buffet breakfast restaurant, a coffee shop, and a Chinese restaurant. The Chinese restaurant has a rich variety of categories. It is very convenient to eat, drink and have fun. Especially in the evening, sitting on the balcony, blowing the evening breeze, listening to the sound of the sea, watching the sunset, it is a very comfortable slow-paced holiday life, lazy holiday style. For the location and those who like Dadonghai, you can choose here. The location is really good.

[Hotel location/transportation]
Sunshine Resort Intime Sanya is located at No. 88 Haihua Road (near Donghai Road), Dadonghai Tourist Area, Sanya City. It is in the core commercial area of ‚Äã‚ÄãSanya and is very easy to find. There is a McDonald's and Bawang Chaji next to it, so you can directly go there. Arrive quickly according to the map positioning. The location is excellent, close to the beach and shopping malls. The room is spacious and has a broad view. It is convenient to eat and travel, and the surrounding living facilities are complete. The environment is beautiful and the climate is pleasant. It was renovated in 2018 and opened in 2003, so the facilities are still relatively new and it can be regarded as a treasure-level five-star hotel.
Staying at Sanya Yintai Sunshine Resort Hotel is also very convenient for travel. The specific distance to the surrounding business areas is as follows: 3.47 kilometers from Dadonghai/Luhuitou Scenic Area/Banshan Peninsula, 5.14 kilometers from the urban railway station/Hailv Duty Free City/Eternal Scenery Area It is 19.77 kilometers away from Sanya Phoenix International Airport, 11.59 kilometers away from Sanya Station, 13.91 kilometers away from Yalong Bay Station, and 4.63 kilometers away from Sanya city center.

„ÄêFront Desk/Public Area„Äë
Sanya Yintai Sunshine Resort Hotel is located in the core area of ‚Äã‚ÄãDadonghai Tourist Resort. The 20,000-square-meter private tropical garden is naturally integrated with the beach. You can reach the beach through the hotel garden. There are many Internet celebrity restaurants, leisure shopping, and entertainment spots in the surrounding area. In the city, you can enjoy the prosperity and tranquility of a tropical coastal city.
It has a parent-child guest room floor and can provide cribs and playpens. It is equipped with exclusive children's swimming pools, indoor and outdoor children's playgrounds and other parent-child entertainment facilities. A variety of parent-child activities are held every day, so that guests can enjoy the island's parent-child vacation time. There are 8 restaurants and lounges, 3 outdoor swimming pools, gyms and other complete facilities including a camping bar, and all-day butler service, allowing you to enjoy comfort and a wonderful trip.
The hotel's appearance is in a modern and simple European style, highlighting the a**osphere of art and culture. The front desk is in the lobby on the second floor. The entire front desk is quite satisfactory and the check-in process is quick and easy. It is a relatively large front desk area with a place to rest, a restaurant and a coffee bar next to it. It is spacious and bright.

„ÄêGuest Room„Äë
The hotel is designed according to "Simple European" standards. The room type I stayed in was a "Superior Twin Room", and the store manager upgraded it to a "Deluxe Sea View Twin Room (Tianhai Journey)" for free. Thank you very much. The room is spacious and comfortable, with complete hardware facilities, air conditioning, white and green simple solid wood furniture, and the guest rooms are equipped with TV, hair dryer, Wifi and other daily necessities. Private bathroom and 24-hour hot water supply, clean and ventilated. Khaki curtains have a blackout effect. The guest rooms have independent balconies. Both sitting and sleeping can overlook the entire bay. Open the curtains and you will see the beautiful Dadonghai Beach, which is very healing.
I live on the 9th floor and have a very good view of the sea. The bedroom is about 40 square meters, with two 1.35-meter beds. The bedding is pure white and clean. The beds are of moderate softness and hardness. The quilt is laid out neatly. It is equipped with two pillows and a green pillow. The walls are refreshing and white. The tone is warm, white and beige, and there is a small table and chairs. The exquisite accessories add a touch of warmth. It is more suitable for tourists and vacationers to live!

„Äêbathroom„Äë
The bathroom is well lit and has an exhaust fan. The bathroom is separated from wet and dry, the water comes out quickly, and it is very comfortable when taking a bath. There is also a small bathtub, but I still prefer to get wet in the rain. The sink is in the bathroom and the toiletries are quite complete.

„ÄêKey words of praise„Äë
The clothes hanger is made of heavy solid wood, and the plastic seal has just been removed. It is very new and feels safe to use. Sometimes I don't dare to use clothes hangers in hotels, but this time I feel relieved. The balcony not only has a beautiful view of the sea, but is also very convenient for drying clothes. There is a simple folding rack. There is a lot of sunshine during the day, and it dries in a short time. There is also a warm sun fragrance!
You will also receive a lot of tickets, coupons, etc. when you check in. The front desk staff will explain how to use them in detail, which is quite considerate.

„ÄêGourmet catering„Äë
Breakfast time is 7:00-10:00
There are two styles: Chinese and Western. I prefer Chinese noodle soup, so I ordered a bowl of vegetable rice noodle soup in the noodle area. Tips, if the taste is too strong, you can pour beef in the deli area and it will instantly become beef noodle soup. The taste is great It‚Äôs great, it‚Äôs best to add a little beef soup, it will be more delicious~
For dessert, I tried red bean cake and mung bean cake, which were pretty good. I also had a bowl of ice cream with a little Russian boy. He chose the matcha flavor. I tried matcha and strawberry, both were okay. If you don‚Äôt like it too sweet, matcha tastes better~

[Other hotel facilities]
Solarium/infirmary/children's pool/gym/food delivery service/lobby bar first aid kit/child care/security alarm/VIP channel check-in/smoking-free floor, etc.

„ÄêOverall Rating„Äë

Comfortable, clean, tidy and safe, giving people the warmth of home.
The service staff are warm and friendly, five stars for service attitude, five stars for hygiene, five stars for safety, and five stars for value for money.

It was still very comfortable to stay in. The color scheme was very refreshing. It was not luxurious, but simple enough. The child slept in a navy-style crib, and you could see Dadonghai.
It was very beautiful when the weather was good~
The swimming pool was good~The service was good~and a self-service afternoon tea was given~
You can go directly to the beach from the hotel garden by swiping your card. There are hotel lounge chairs, which are very comfortable.
There are many Russians.
The children's playground on the underground first floor of the hotel is also good, enough for children aged five or six to play for a long time.
The only imperfection is that the hotel reception is on the second floor. There are many shops in the building, which is a bit dazzling and noisy.
The surrounding area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel is very lively and convenient, and takeaway is also very convenient. There is a courier cabinet at the door on the first floor.
It's great to go to Xiaodonghai to catch the sea in ten minutes from Checheng.
Dadonghai is better than I thought. I will stay here again next time, especially if I bring my parents and children who like to be lively.

In recent days, it has been drizzling in Sanya in the morning, and it is basically sunny at noon. It is super comfortable to go to the beach for a walk at this time. I don't want to leave Sanya~

msg:I have been here before, so I chose this hotel after landing this time.
I am very satisfied with the facilities, hygiene and environment. The view outside the room is beautiful.
For me personally, this hotel is very close to the beach where you can swim in Dadonghai. The hotel also provides bags and towels for taking to the beach. It is a great choice for those who want to stroll on the beach when they first arrive in Hainan.
In terms of geographical location, it is very easy to get there by taxi from the First Market. It is very close to the Summer Depar**ent Store. If you want to take some day trips, you can choose to start from the Summer Depar**ent Store, which is very convenient.
This time I arrived at noon. I went to the Coconut Dream Corridor and the First Market on the same day, and went on a day trip to Jiajing Island the next day. The itinerary revolves around the hotel and is very comfortable.

msg:I initially went there because of the ratings and distance. Looking at the rating of 4.8, someone on Little Sweet Potato also recommended it.
Rating: I finally found out how the good reviews came about. When you check out, they will give you a meal coupon for afternoon tea. Most people are short-tongued and are embarrassed to give good reviews by the way, and that person is very bad at doing things. , the process of asking for positive comments is very uncomfortable, and the evaluation becomes passive and semi-transactional.
It's quite close to the beach, but the beach on Dadonghai Sea, not to mention Yalong Bay, can't even compare to Sanya Bay. It's too far behind.
The key is that the bed curtains cannot block the light at night, and they are not soundproof. You can hear the sounds from the street. Once you have stayed there, you know that the facilities in the room are extremely old. It feels like the early 1990s. It is recommended to go for cost-effectiveness. If you go there, just choose the hotel based on the year it was built. As for the rating of 4.6 or above, it‚Äôs fine. Too many good reviews may also have a lot of water.

The swimming pool is also very large, with a maximum depth of 1.5 and at least 2 safety guards, which gives me a good sense of security for a half-baked swimmer like me. You can use swimming rings and floating boards! You can also play in the water with the little dolls
Praise the service! The staff will help us clean the room every day, and will also help fold the clothes that we have thrown away! It's really hard work!

I stayed for 4 consecutive nights during the 51 period, and they upgraded our room type. Although it is by the sea, the quilt is not damp. There are air conditioners on both the upper and lower floors of the duplex. It is clean and hygienic, and the cleaning staff also helped us arrange our personal belongings. It was very comfortable to live. The front desk service attitude was very good.
You can see the sea when you push the door out. The waves were very big those days and we couldn‚Äôt go into the sea.
There are 3 swimming pools in total. When we were there, swimming pool No. 1 was open (until 11 pm), and the children‚Äôs pool and No. 2 were under maintenance.
You can go directly to Dadonghai Beach behind the hotel, and there is a small door on the road behind. If you go out, go back 5 meters and there is a switch on the left hand side. If you enter the hotel, use the room card to swipe the access control (sometimes it can‚Äôt be swiped open).
The hotel takes a taxi to the First Market Night Market 2~3 kilometers, Jiefang Road Pedestrian Street 4~5 kilometers, and Yiheng Theme Night Market about 9 kilometers. Anyway, I feel that taking a taxi to anywhere is not far, and it is not expensive (including going to Yalong Bay)üòÇ

msg:I went there because the reviews were very good. I can't expect it to be a five-star hotel. In short, the price-performance ratio is good. The swimming pool includes breakfast. It is close to the beach. The price is good. The disadvantages are that the room facilities are old, the quilt is a bit damp, and the bathroom has to shower in the bathtub, which is not very convenient. There is no direct elevator from the breakfast restaurant to the C building in the hotel. You have to walk from the restaurant on the first floor to the elevator at the door to the second floor, and then walk from the second floor to the C building elevator. It is very troublesome. It is also inconvenient to push a stroller to the swimming pool. There is no direct access, only stairs, but there is a swing by the swimming pool. It is good. There are many foreigners in the hotel

There are all the necessary facilities, including a swimming pool, a gym, and a naughty castle. The sun is very strong in Sanya during the day. The hotel has an indoor children's playground for children to play. In the afternoon, when the sun sets, you can walk directly to the beach to play in the sand. I will come again at this time next year!!!

First of all, the hotel is very close to the seaside swimming pool, the environment is very good, and there is a dedicated passage directly to the beach. I brought my family and children here for vacation. I can feel the sea breeze when I leave the hotel, which is greatüëçüèª.
Secondly, transportation, catering, life and shopping are very convenient near the hotel.
Third, the hotel facilities are relatively complete and the room is relatively clean. There is a swimming pool and children's play facilities on the first floor.

msg:I went to this hotel many years ago and thought the environment and location were very good, so I chose this place again this time when I was alone. From the beginning of checking in, I felt that the room only had floor-to-ceiling windows and no balcony. Later, I didn't like the angle of the sea view from the balcony. I changed rooms twice and finally chose the third room. A staff member named Pan Yan at the front desk of the hotel was very patient and friendly to provide me with options. He didn't think I was troublesome at all. He also asked about the return flight time very considerately to see if I needed a phone reminder on the return day to avoid missing the flight.

Hygiene: Although it is an old hotel, it is clean everywhere and there is a faint fragrance in the air.

Facilities: The hotel is next to the Dadonghai Scenic Area. You can go swimming in the sea just a few dozen meters away from the backyard of the hotel in shorts and slippers. There is also a swimming pool in the hotel yard that is open until late. The water quality is very clean. There are also many foreign tourists, adults and children playing in the pool. The a**osphere is very relaxing and comfortable.

Environment: The hotel yard is densely planted. Even if you don't leave the hotel, it is a very relaxing thing to look at the sea view on the balcony and bask in the sun on the lounge chair by the pool.

In general, it is not so luxurious and advanced, but the overall feeling is very warm and comfortable. It is very convenient to take the bus to go anywhere. The distance to take a taxi is not far and it won't cost a lot of money. It is really suitable for a normal holiday and relaxation. I would like to stay here next time I come to Sanya.

After leaving the hotel, we found the tablet computer left in the room by the child. We contacted and delivered it to the child immediately. During the stay, various matters were responded to quickly and perfectly. I deeply regret that I couldn't stay a few more days during the island tour this year. I wish you a smooth work, everything goes well, and your family is happy.
I have stayed in Yanlord, MGM, and Art, but only Yintai gave me the feeling of home.
Service: A must-stay hotel every time I come to Sanya, with high-quality service for ten years

Facilities: An old five-star hotel that receives foreign guests all year round. It enjoys the most beautiful beach sea view of Dadonghai. The vegetation inside is lush, as if you are in a tropical jungle. This year, new lounge chairs have been added to the wooden plank road area. It is very comfortable to lie under the coconut trees in the sea breeze.

Hygiene: Clean without dead corners, linens are as white as new

Service: Ten years of enthusiasm, every employee will actively meet the requirements during the stay, the restaurant on the second floor of the hotel is of high standard, the baby eats happily. The travel photography level is very high, there is no forced consumption, the photographer is friendly, and the children like it very much.

What I like most about Yintai is that the hotel is only more than 100 meters away from Dadonghai Beach. The quality and water quality of Dadonghai Beach are very good. Therefore, Yintai Hotel is considered to be one of the first-tier sea view hotels. When staying at Yintai Hotel, the commercial facilities outside the hotel are very convenient. All kinds of food, drinks, and supermarkets are on the street outside the hotel gate, such as: McDonald's, Luckin Coffee, Kudi Coffee, Chongqing Food, Chengdu food, Hainan food, Northeast food, pharmacies, supermarkets, etc. Between the hotel and Dadonghai Beach, there is a street that did not have restaurants and bars when I came here more than 10 years ago. You can eat and drink coffee by the beach. So Yintai is a hotel we are very satisfied with and worth coming back!

It is also convenient to travel. It is very close to the station, Dadonghai tourist area, Summer Depar**ent Store and various places to eat. It is also very close to Luhuitou. Unfortunately, it was too hot in Sanya and I suffered from heatstroke the next day, so I didn‚Äôt go there. I decided to stay here next time and stop by Luhuitou.
Breakfast is served until twelve o'clock, so you can sleep until you wake up naturally and eat slowly. There are many kinds of food, and the noodles are delicious.
The scenery is particularly good. I stayed in a mountain and sea view room. I could see the Luhuitou Scenic Area and the sea, as well as the swimming pool downstairs. The room comes with a small balcony where you can enjoy the view and dry clothes.
There is also a small drawback. The shampoo makes my hair not smooth after washing. I hope to add conditioner in the future.

This is definitely good news for those who like to sleep in. The swimming pool is large and clean, and there are many toys for children. There is also a pet paradise beside the swimming pool, but it is not as cute as the clingy tabby cat that wanders around several restaurants smelling the smell and only eats fish and shrimp. happiness. To say that the hotel needs improvement, it is still in terms of hardware: the old-fashioned square tiles on the floor of the room and the bathroom are very low-grade; the gap in the door of the room is a bit large. Although the sound insulation of the two rooms is okay, it is difficult to walk around the door. The sound is still very clear. Generally speaking, this is still the first choice when visiting Dadonghai.

There are more than 100 kinds of Chinese and Western self-service. The service at the front desk is also very considerate. , I am very happy to live here. The facilities and equipment are a little bit old, but it does not affect the use.

msg:Run away quickly and don't come here. A hotel with more than 650 yuan is like a guest house. The location is good but it is very noisy and the sound insulation is very poor. There are many foreigners, and it feels very messy. I always feel unsafe and unhygienic after seeing dozens of foreigners. This hotel feels like a guest house for shopping groups. The hygiene is very poor. Everywhere you enter is dirty and the facilities are old. , there is also an Ultraman parent-child room with two Ultraman portraits and two monster toys. Boss, do you have a conscience? You can just go grab the money for more than 600 yuan, instead of staying in a 7-day chain. Especially those with children, don‚Äôt come here, it‚Äôs a huge pit! ! ! There is also a mother who brought her baby. Don't come here. There is no privacy. The lobby is like a shopping mall. The check-in area is on the second floor. It is crowded and anyone can come up. And the door to the room is always broken. I originally wanted to live in Dadonghai, which is closer to the city, and I booked a hotel with a price of more than 600, thinking that no matter how bad it was, it wouldn't be much worse. I already had the mentality that the hotel facilities here are incomplete and outdated! But what I never expected was that it was so dirty, really dirty! The only thing I give 5 points for is the front desk service! The receptionist was very polite and attentive. But I was given a bunch of discount cards, including a 50% discount on food, Betel Valley, and so on. They are just the kind of low-priced tourist groups. Don‚Äôt come. Don‚Äôt come. You‚Äôll be in trouble for life! Those with babies, run away! If I hadn't spent more than 600, I would have bought a standing ticket all night long! I checked out early the next morning. I have never written a negative review in my life. The first negative review I gave to this hotel was really about the facilities and cleanliness of the guest house. This location is worth 300, but the hotel's sanitary facilities and environment are not worth a penny. The maximum is 300 yuan, don‚Äôt order if it exceeds! I don‚Äôt want my brothers and sisters to be deceived, don‚Äôt come, don‚Äôt come, please, I‚Äôm afraid you will feel uncomfortable when you come, I don‚Äôt want them to deceive people.

The front desk service is very good, the attitude is also very enthusiastic, and the service makes people feel warm. The breakfast is also good, rich in variety and delicious.

msg:I initially booked it with Ctrip for seven days and then renewed it for more than ten days. Xiao Tang at the front desk contacted me on WeChat before going to ask about my housing needs and help me make notes. I booked a superior twin room, and Xiao Tang was very considerate and helped me upgrade to a sea view twin room. One reason was that it was due to the opening time of the hotel. It has been too long, and it is normal for facilities to be damaged occasionally. The sewer pipes of the washbasin in the two rooms we stayed in have been leaking. The hotel engineering depar**ent came to inspect and said that glue needed to be applied. However, considering that there were children, the glue would have a chemical smell. , the engineer from the engineering depar**ent called the lady at the front desk. After learning about it, the front desk actively helped us deal with the room change problem. We upgraded to a 270¬∞C full sea view room, an extra large balcony with 270¬∞C full sea view floor-to-ceiling windows, a relatively large bathroom, separate wet and dry bathrooms. Next to the bathtub is a panoramic floor-to-ceiling window with sea views. The hotel's indoor and outdoor children's playground, swimming pool, and cute pet paradise are a must-go process for our baby every day. The daily parent-child handicraft classes are also very satisfactory. I especially like the hotel's buffet breakfast. It is really rich for this price. It has always been Dinner is open until 12 o'clock. Wu Qingyang, Li Renjun, and Wang Xiaodan in the restaurant are really warm and friendly. When they see us with our children, they will carefully ask about our dining needs and help the baby pack her favorite fruits and snacks. The handsome lifeguards at the swimming pool greet and interact with the baby enthusiastically every time and give away small toys. There is a beach 30 meters from the back door of the hotel garden. The hotel provides free sand digging tools and water guns. The beach also has exclusive deck chairs and umbrellas. After enjoying the beach, you can enter the hotel and there is a dedicated freshwater footbath. The last thumbs up goes to Sister Fu Kongchan who is in charge of guest room hygiene. She is really attentive and capable. When she saw me carrying alcohol and my child‚Äôs small toilet, she knew that we attach great importance to hygiene. Sister Fu Kongchan gives me the best service every time. We use disposable rags to wipe furniture, and spray alcohol to wipe it for us. Even when cleaning the bathroom, we lay on the floor and wipe it. The carpets are also vacuumed every day. Many hotel refrigerators are just furnishings. Very few guest room sanitation wipes the refrigerator every day. Inside, Sister Fu Kongchan wipes the inside and outside of the refrigerator with disposable rags every day. She is so careful that she even wipes the corners and railings of the balcony every day. When she sees that we have a baby toilet, she will give us a few more garbage bags every day for us to put the baby in. For toilet use. thank you very much. In short, during the 20 days in Yintai, although there were some hiccups in the front, every staff member was very conscientious and made the adults and children stay clean and comfortable during these 20 days, eat with confidence and satisfaction, and have fun. Thanks again to Xiao Tang at the front desk, the lady at the front desk who helped me change my room, Brother Wu Qingyang in the restaurant, Brother Li Renjun, the beauty Wang Xiaodan, Sister Fu Kongchan, and the handsome lifeguards at the swimming pool.

The hotel has a beautiful environment and the tropical gardens are exquisitely maintained. The room is well soundproofed and you can see the sea while lying on the bed. The view is stunning!

The back door of the hotel leads directly to the beach, and the green water is crystal clear. The most heartwarming thing is that the front desk helped with extended check-out, so you don't have to worry about being without a place for a few hours before your flight in the evening.

But what made our stay truly unforgettable was the excellent hotel guide Ivan, who met us at the airport, told us a lot of interesting things about local history, was always in touch and helped with everything if necessary. Thank you Ivan!

I liked the breakfasts - varied and tasty dishes, fresh fruits and pastries, aromatic coffee. It was a great start to every day!

And, of course, I can‚Äôt help but mention the cleaning. The room was cleaned every day, the bed linen was changed, and the bathroom always had fresh towels and personal care products.

Overall, the hotel left us with the most positive impressions, and if we ever return to this city, we will definitely stay here again.
Thanks also to the receptionist Chad!

They helped with late check-out and asked whether we needed to buy medicine and whether breakfast needed to be delivered to the room. The whole family was so considerate. We are deeply grateful for the meticulous and thoughtful service. Not only the front desk, but also the room cleaning attitude is very good.

It is very convenient to go to the beach to bask in the sun. It is so comfortable to bask in the sun this season. This time I came to the hotel and there were some changes. First of all, the breakfast time was changed to 12 o'clock, so I could avoid peak dining times and sleep in at will. The hotel has opened a new restaurant called dregs and vinegar hot pot, but I haven‚Äôt tried it yet. It is said to be a local specialty restaurant, so I must try it if I have the chance. There is also a new duty-free shop on the second floor, which means the hotel now has more comprehensive facilities and is more convenient. Needless to say, the hotel service is still online. Every employee is sincere. Especially the front desk treats regular guests with kindness and enthusiasm. The communication method is also very comfortable and very good. Come to Sanya and live in the beautiful and warm Yintai.

It is very close to Dadonghai. There are exclusive deck chairs, but they are closed after four o'clock. No explanation was given to the guests.
Cute Pet Paradise, sign at the door until 8pm. When we arrived at six o'clock, the door was locked and we couldn't enter. I asked the front desk, but the front desk didn't know. I asked the park staff again, and they called back and said they would close at six o'clock.

Room service: On the first day of check-in, a waiter opened the door and entered at will, saying that he was checking the room hygiene. Is it possible that guests staying there can enter at will? I was so scared that I locked the door when I entered in the next few days. Some waiters would still try to open the door and enter, which was not good. There are guest rooms, and you cannot enter them at will unless the guest asks the waiter to clean them.
Restaurant: There is a fly in the oin**ent. Although breakfast is open until 12 o'clock, if you go after 10:30, the hot dishes are basically empty. The quality of the breakfast is average, and it does not have a five-star feel. The same goes for afternoon tea. I went there at four o'clock and all the dishes were empty.
Overall, the price-performance ratio is quite high. Seeing the five-star rating on the front desk, there is still a bit of a gap.

Especially the swimming pool, its depth and area are very suitable for a cute pet paradise. There are also many animals in the animal paradise, and there are so many kinds that you can't see them all. In short, the service attitude of this hotel is very good.

It is more open and the front desk lady is worthy of praise for her thoughtfulness and meticulousness. Special praise should be given to the Haiyue Xuan restaurant.

msg:The hotel is located in the core area of ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄãDadonghai Seaside, just a stone's throw from the seaside. The surrounding business a**osphere is strong, and various catering formats are available, making it very convenient for dining and entertainment. The hotel is composed of three ship-shaped buildings, divided into buildings A, B, and C. Building A is closest to the lobby exit, but faces the street, and may be affected by noise at night. Building C is the farthest, but it is far away from the street and quiet. If you want to go out conveniently, live in Building A. If you want peace and quiet, live in Building C. Building B is between AC. (See attached picture) The lobby is on the second floor, and each building is connected by the second floor. If you want to go from the room to the swimming pool or go out, you have to go to the second floor first, and then go to the first floor from the elevator on the second floor, which is a bit inconvenient. . The floor in the public area is paved with stone and is well maintained. When I went back at 11pm one night, I came across the staff cleaning the floor. I wonder if it is possible to keep it so clean and tidy every day. There are two ThyssenKrupp elevators in each building, which can accommodate about 8 people. Since there are not many floors, the elevators do not appear to be crowded. There is a small gym in the aisle between Buildings B and C on the second floor, opposite a small supermarket. There is a Thai Yue Restaurant (Thai cuisine) and Coconut Chicken on the first floor. If you don‚Äôt want to go out to look for food, it is also very convenient to stay in the hotel. By the way, the water for cooking the chicken in Coconut Chicken is poured on site with the original juice of three coconuts. ! The parking lot is located behind the hotel and can accommodate about thirty cars. There is a fruit supermarket at the back door of the hotel after entering the parking lot, and the prices are similar to those outside. After talking about the public areas, let‚Äôs talk about the conditions of the rooms. The room was upgraded by the girl at the front desk to a sea view room with a balcony. The balcony is not big and is in the shape of a high waist triangle. You can see the hotel garden and the Dadonghai sea view. Although it is not directly opposite, the view is not small, which can satisfy the needs of inland people. Yearning for the sea. By the way, the balcony door latch fell off when I first checked in. After reporting it to the front desk, a master came to fix it in more than ten minutes. It was very efficient. I like it! The decoration of the room is a bit old, and it feels like it is 20 years younger. However, it is hygienic and clean. The room does not have the musty smell that often occurs in rooms facing the sea, and the bathroom has no peculiar smell. The air conditioning is powerful and the noise is not too loud. But the biggest disadvantage is that the sound insulation is not good. You can clearly hear coughs and chats in the next room. You don't need to set the alarm clock in the morning. When the next door starts talking, you will wake up. The TV is the oldest LCD TV with no online video function, so you can only watch TV. Fortunately, there is Phoenix TV, so you don't have to just watch CCTV. Russians are also frequent guests of the hotel, so there are several Russian channels. Another thing is that there is no night light in the bathroom. Turning on the light at night will make you feel sleepy. The curtains are not like what a five-star hotel should have. They cannot be closed tightly no matter how you pull them. There is a gap of about 10cm on both sides from the wall, which does not create a good lunch break environment. I hope these details can be considered when decorating next time. On the other hand, the hotel's reply to the review has obvious traces of copying and pasting, is not targeted, and is too official. To sum up, the hotel is in an excellent location, the public facilities are up to standard, and the room decoration is not good, but the friendly and dedicated staff make up for the lack of decoration. The two handsome guys who greeted us at the hotel door were warm and friendly, the girl at the front desk was friendly and efficient, and the handsome guy in the lounge chair area set up by the hotel in the coconut grove by the sea was serious and talkative. Whether you are driving by yourself or flying in, Dadonghai Resort Hotel is worth a try. In addition, Yang Mama‚Äôs restaurant opposite the hotel can avoid pitfalls. The crab roe dumplings only have meat but no crab roe, the millet porridge is not cooked enough, and the rice rolls are too sticky and look like pre-made dishes. A few steps further, the millet porridge served by Sister Mao's Hong Kong fans is much better, and the price is only a quarter of that of Mama Yang. That‚Äôs it! I hope this helps you who are still considering whether to move in. By the way, there are singers singing in the hotel lobby bar every night, and they are very good at singing. That‚Äôs it! Hope the hotel will be renovated soon.

Moreover, the hotel üè® also has a 20,000-square-meter private garden on the first floor, which is simply a natural oxygen bar. The environment is good, and it is also very good for filming. Walking and taking photos üì∑ are very nice, and the hotel also has a swimming pool, gym, children's playground üé†, etc.

The best thing is that through the garden, you can reach the beach of Dadonghai. There is a beachüèñÔ∏è, a lawn, and deck chairs (exclusively for guests). You can bask in the sunüåûlisten to the sound of the wavesüåä. It‚Äôs such a wonderful time.

This is really a hotel with convenient transportation and good location. I will still choose here next time

Service: Due to a temporary adjus**ent to the schedule, check-in was delayed for one day. Not only did the fee not increase, the front desk also helped upgrade the room~
Facilities: The hotel is located in the Dadonghai tourist area. The parking lot is free. Remember to find a shade tree when parking, otherwise the warm sunshine in Sanya will tell you the answer. Swimming pool, garden, afternoon tea, restaurant are quite complete
Environment: I was given a second-floor suite with a sea view. The style is quite resort-style. The decoration is good. It is an old star-rated hotel. The location is advantageous. The garden has winding paths and there is a small door at the back. When you go out, you can reach the beach and swimming area. , and what makes the family happiest. The beaches are all filled with foreigners. As expected, there are no distinctions between Chinese and foreigners when coming to Hainan during the winter.
Hygiene: The room is very clean and the supporting facilities are quite good. Haha, this is the evaluation given by me who often travels for business ~
It was the first time I took my parents out together. They were very happy. I really recommend it. The price/performance ratio is very high.

The location of the hotel is very good: on the first line, close to all the cafes, shops, etc. The pool is gorgeous. Unfortunately, the second pool was closed, but it is smaller and not as comfortable, so it‚Äôs not a big loss. In the pool you can use different circles, mats, sups, etc. The area is very green, just like in a botanical garden. Due to the cancellation of the flight, we checked out a day earlier, the hotel refunded the amount for one night, although the reservation was non-cancellable, for which we thank him. Mini pigs are running around the area. Overall, we were pleased.

When I checked in, I saw that I had upgraded to a sea view family room with my two children. The room hygiene and extended stay hygiene were very good and there were no blind spots. Just outside the door is Dadonghai Beach. The quality of the sand is better than that of Yalong Bay now. The hotel has small pigs and cats, and they are very friendly and clean. The breakfast buffet area is also very orderly. Eating and transportation around are also very convenient. The hotel experience at this price is so good, I will choose to stay again.

Of course, you should live comfortably and enjoy life while on vacation‚Äº Ô∏èSo it‚Äôs very important to find a good hotel in advance‚úÖ

I made a choice with my friends for a long time before traveling, and finally booked
üìçYintai Sunshine Resort Hotel
üß≠Navigation search: Dadonghai, No. 88 Haihua Road, Jiyang District (near Donghai Road)
Mainly because it is the best choice for vacation in terms of environmental facilities and location.

‚úÖThe first thing is the locationüåüüåüüåüüåü
The hotel has direct access to the Dadonghai Sea, and the beach is right outside your door‚õ±It is very convenient to watch the sea or the sunset. You can leave whenever you want‚≠ïÔ∏èThe key is that there are no crowds

‚úÖHotel environmentüåüüåüüåüüåüüåü
What attracts me most about Yintai Sunshine is its environment. The overall decoration style is tropical island resort style. It is very quiet and green. The air is fresh. It feels like living in a tropical rainforest. Wearing comfortable clothes every day in the back garden of the hotel Walking is the most pleasant momentü•∞It‚Äôs beautiful to take any photos~, and I even met a cute pigüêΩ
There are also many large and small swimming pools üèäüèª‚ôÄÔ∏è in the park, as well as gyms üßòüèª‚ôÄÔ∏è camping areas üèï and various recreational facilities üé¢.

‚úÖSea viewüåüüåüüåüüåüüåü
Friends who want to see the seaüåä must choose a sea view room. There will be a super large balcony‚òÄÔ∏è‚òÄÔ∏èYou can see the sea from the room. Every morning when I open the curtains and the sun and sea breeze hit my face, I really want to say that the world is worth it. ‚≠ïÔ∏èIt is recommended to live on a higher floor to experience the sea more immersively~

‚úÖSurroundingsüåüüåüüåü
The surrounding supporting facilities are complete, and it is super convenient to eat, drink and play nearby. I just checked in to a local specialty coconut chicken, which was super delicious without any surprisesüòã

‚úÖValue for money üåüüåüüåüüåü
Sanya‚Äôs peak season starts every Octoberüî•It‚Äôs super cost-effective to stay in a five-star hotel at this price~The hotel provides a buffet breakfast with all kinds of special delicaciesü••üçúüç§ü¶™üçû, which is very rich

üèùThe above is the hotel guide for this vacation. If you plan to come to Sanya, I really recommend staying here~üè°Friends who plan to travel to other places may also wish to start from these aspects when choosing a hotel‚úÖ
It‚Äôs really fun to enjoy the sea breeze in Sanyaü´ßwaiting for the early morning and sunsetü•≥I hope everyone can harvest the best memories during the tripüíñüíñ

The configuration of the room is also quite good, clean and tidy, and the view of the sea is also very good. Even if you don't leave home, you can get up and face the sea, and your whole mood will suddenly become brighter!

Whether the hotel's sanitary conditions are up to standard can be seen from the bathroom. Although the decoration is a bit old-school, it does not give people a dirty feeling. Every blind spot visible to the naked eye is very clean! Many emerging Internet celebrity hotels may appear to be golden, but in fact they cannot withstand the scrutiny of details. The quality of the infrastructure is worrisome, and the professionalism of the employees is hard to describe...but my family and I can really feel the sincerity and professionalism at Yintai! Ms. Liu Mingfei at the front desk gave us a lot of convenience and upgraded the room type for free. All problems were explained in detail, patiently and professionally. They also helped us quickly solve any accidents we encountered during our stay. As a foreigner, I was really touched! !
The location of the hotel is also very convenient, and there is an independent swimming pool in the hotel. It is divided into children's area and adult area, and the children's entertainment area is also very good. Just past the swimming pool is the beach, which is very convenient!
Overall, great value for money! Great experience! I will still stay here if I travel again!

Although the hotel is a bit old, it is very clean and tidy. It doesn't feel too trendy as it is next to the beach. On the contrary, the sun is shining in and it is warm. The view of the entire bay from the window is also great~
The hotel has an adult swimming pool and a children's swimming pool. There are swings, slides, trampolines and other facilities beside the swimming pool. The girls had so much fun that they all got a tan.
There is also a children's playground on the underground floor, which is more suitable for babies. There are various handicraft activities during the National Day period, which little girls will also like.
The path from the hotel swimming pool to the beach is under construction, and it says it will be completed after 10.10. However, it is relatively close to the beach from the main entrance. The swimming pool is just right in the morning and the beach is perfect in the afternoon. In addition, the beach is closed at 6 o'clock and no one can go into the sea. I want to swim in the sea. Be early.
Finally, I would like to thank the front desk customer service Li Hui for her considerate service. She upgraded our room type for free and also gave us afternoon tea and a small departure gift~

The facilities in the hotel are also good. The children can play in the children's water park during the day and the large heated swimming pool at night. They just swim every day. It's so fun! Moreover, swimming rings, floating boards, and sand digging toys are all free to use, which saved me a lot of things to bring! This is very critical!
The hotel is very close to the seaside, just take a short walk to get there, and you can hear the sound of the waves when the hotel is quiet!
The theme room I stayed in was on the second floor. I thought it would be very damp and full of mosquitoes, but it turned out not to be the case! This is so much better than I expected!
The service attitude of the hotel staff is super good and they are always responsive to all my requests. My suitcase was broken and someone came to help me fix it immediately. They also gave me afternoon tea when I checked out. But our flight was early, so they brought us some coconut juice and gave it to us. Toys for kids!
Let‚Äôs talk about the shortcomings,
The hotel's breakfast buffet has many varieties, which basically meets your needs. You will definitely be full, but nothing too amazing.
If you order takeout, you have to go to the hotel door to get it, which is a bit far.

msg:The 270-degree sea view room booked for this trip is really good. Since the hotel was developed early, the location is definitely C. It‚Äôs just that the 270-degree room is designed, but the sea is not that wide (the view is blocked by some other buildings). slightly affected). Before booking a room, I saw that the hotel had high ratings and also read the negative reviews. I stayed in this room type for six days (first booked three days and then stayed for three days (8.20-8.26)) and then evaluated it objectively. The location of the hotel is very good. Great, it's convenient to go anywhere, the surrounding area is well developed and there are plenty of parking spaces in the parking lot (on the ground). Not to mention the room service and cleaning, the dishes in the Chinese restaurant are also delicious! The front desk staff are very warm and polite. If you have any questions, I can ask and communicate at any time. They are all very nice. The girl who received me, Xiao Mo, is very dedicated. It only takes a minute or two to get to the beach after walking out of the room, which is great. It has been four years since I last came to Dadonghai. I feel that the beach at Dadonghai is cleaner and has much better sand than before. Regarding the old hotel facilities, I want to say something objectively: This is a fact. After all, the hotel has its age. The old five-star hotel has an excellent location but some (bathroom) room facilities are really difficult to renovate (but it does not affect the use at all) . The room has no peculiar smell and is very hygienic. There is a large pillar on the viewing balcony which affects the viewing angle. There is a lack of a chair in front of the desk in this room type (because I have to sit at the desk and write and can't find a place to sit). One more thing, I personally think the negative reviews are because of the room type they chose (the price does determine the viewing angle of the room type). My room type is indeed quiet, has a good view and is clean! Mr. He has stayed in many hotels during his more than 20 years of travel. He highly approves of Intime Sunshine and recommends it to everyone!

msg:To be honest, I first came to Sanya more than ten years ago when I was a newly graduated college student. At that time, Intime was really one of the best hotels in Sanya except Yalong Bay. This time I revisited the old place and took Intime as my hotel. After the first stop, I was really a little disappointed. The aging hardware can be renovated, but if the self-driving force for excellence is gone, it will be difficult for the hotel to rejuvenate:
1. The facilities are old and the rooms have a strong guest house style. The hardware should really be completely renovated and upgraded. To be honest, it is the lowest among the five-star hotels we have stayed in in China;
2. The air conditioner in the room was broken when I checked in. Leaving aside the hardware problem, the disposal process was improper. Sanya is very hot in summer. I first asked the cleaning lady to come over to verify the situation, and then called the maintenance worker to come over for inspection. The guest was made to wait in a stuffy room for nearly thirty minutes without any emergency plan;
3. When the cleaning lady from the housekeeping depar**ent came to verify the situation, the first thing that came to her mind was not how to accommodate the guests. Instead, she first asked the children sitting on the edge of the bed to get up. The reason should be that if we want to change rooms later, they don‚Äôt need to make the bed again. , To be honest, I understand Auntie‚Äôs thoughts. There should be a problem with the training. In this case, it is the hotel‚Äôs fault that has caused trouble to the guests. Shouldn‚Äôt the problem be considered from the guest‚Äôs perspective first? ?
4. Maybe it‚Äôs the peak season, but the breakfast room can‚Äôt accommodate so many people at all. I have to walk around for several days to grab a seat at breakfast every day. Without any guidance, it‚Äôs hard to imagine that this is a service that a five-star hotel should have.
5. Some other minor issues and the above items can no longer be regarded as problems.
ps: During our stay, the room next door checked out early. It seemed that there was leakage in the bathroom. The family booked it for four days and asked to check out early after just one day. üòÖ
After making so many rants, I still said it was okay:
1. The location is very convenient. It is very convenient to eat nearby. There are DQ, Coconut Chicken and a good Thai restaurant on the first floor of the hotel. You can enjoy delicious food without leaving the hotel. There is also Summer Depar**ent Store and Big Pineapple not far from the hotel.
2. The service at the front desk is still very good. All questions are answered and the answers are clear and well-founded. They also invited us to enjoy afternoon tea when we left. We wanted to change to a hotel in Haitang Bay, so we declined, and they warmly gave us Laoye as a gift. Juice, I guess I hope to get a good review.
After much thought, judging from the overall evaluation of Ctrip, the gift-giving method should have earned Intime a lot of praise. I thought about it and thought that Yintai should have no shortage of untrue positive comments from me.
I leave this comment today. I sincerely hope that the hotel management can take a good look at its own problems, and that Intime can restore its former glory as a first-tier hotel.
ps: Dadonghai Beach is under construction. It is recommended that you choose other areas before the repairs are completed.

3. The hotel staff are very caring, especially Li Hui, the lady at the front desk, seeing that we are a couple on honeymoon, she helped upgrade the duplex suite and gave me afternoon tea. When I checked out, I had sudden stomach cramps. Ms. Li helped me deal with it and massaged the acupoints, which relieved the pain.

Unexpectedly, this was the worst night I stayed in Sanya! The hotel is already very old, and all the facilities are dilapidated. The cupboard doors are not closed, and the drain port looks like a prostate patient. Everything is barely repaired, and the sanitary condition is even worse. The balcony is dusty and moldy; the sheets and towels are all covered with faint Darkened! The environment is even more speechless. During the day, the repetitive hawking of noodle shops and snack bars on the roadside is unbearable. The noise of the carnival that lasts until midnight at night makes it impossible to sleep! How did this hotel become like this? ! I came back to Yintai based on the ratings and comments and the good memories from many years ago, but this is the truth! You might want to check if these five-star reviews were obtained in exchange for gifts? That's the truth, that's the truth. Isn't the purpose of comments to allow latecomers to make choices based on the facts and not to fall into traps? To sum up, does Yintai still have five stars? The current situation is not worth even one star!

As expected, when I came to Yintai Sunshine this time, I found that the beach of Dadonghai Bay was clean and the water was clean. I stayed in a deluxe sea view double room. The room was spacious and clean, with fresh furniture. The 2-meter wide bed was soft and comfortable. Overlooking the blue bay of the Dadonghai Sea, standing on the balcony overlooking the blue garden and large swimming pool, the hotel's tropical plant garden is still so charming and beautiful, and the hotel's most famous breakfast is as diverse as ever, especially the variety of bread ü•ñüçû, marvelous!

The hotel is not too big, the greenery and swimming facilities are very good, the service is very considerate, it is very comfortable to live in, it is very close to the beach, it is very suitable for taking children on vacation. The restaurants on the first floor of the hotel are all good, and there is a children's playground on the ba*****t floor, which children like very much. I will choose it next time I come to Sanya.

msg:This time I stayed in two hotels before and after my trip to Sanya. Intime Sunshine was the most satisfactory one in all aspects. I stayed for three days. I was so satisfied that I wanted to stay for another three days. It‚Äôs just that the temporary plan has changed. I will choose this hotel next time. I have already recommended it to my friends who plan to come next month.
Facilities: very good, the decoration in the room looks relatively new, and the color is very refreshing, which is what we like.
Hygiene: Very clean. I used to be obsessed with cleanliness. I brought my own bedding when I went out. This time, I only put bed sheets for the children. In fact, it is okay to leave it alone. Both the naked eye and the skin feel are very clean.
Environment: The environment of the hotel is beautiful, with exclusive swimming pools, but one of them was under maintenance when we came here, and the No. 1 swimming pool was in use, which is relatively large, and the swimming rings and sand dredging tools are free to use, which is very convenient. The hotel is very close to the beach. You can go out from the small door next to the hotel swimming pool, and you can just brush the door when you come back. It is very convenient.
Service: superb. Whether it's the front desk, room service staff, or the pool lifeguards, they all have a very good attitude and are very satisfied. I especially praised Pan Yan at the front desk. Seeing that we took the elderly and children with us, we took the initiative to upgrade the room, but she was troubled by various things later. I took the trouble to answer and solve it patiently, the boss should add chicken legs.

Once we arrive at the store, the little girl at the front desk will upgrade our situation for free I got a family room, got an extra bed for free, and delayed the check-out time. This kind of personalized service must be praised. The sanitation is good, the guest room has complete supporting facilities, the hotel environment is good, and the swimming pool is also liked by children. The most important thing is that the back garden is right next to it. It's next to the seaside, although it's under construction now, it doesn't affect the children's interest at all. They had a great time. They also gave afternoon tea when they checked out. By the way, the breakfast is so rich, it's worth staying in, and it's cost-effective!

I also went to Xiaodonghai to catch some small crabs. Finally, I would like to mention Xiao Wang, who helped us check in, and answered any questions in a timely manner. The Yanoda ticket event is over, and we gave us tickets to the Betel Nut Valley. We also went to experience it. The trip to Sanya was very happy and came to a successful conclusion.

It perfectly met our expectations for a seaside resort hotel in Sanya. It has high-quality service, simple and clean room layout, private hotel garden, and a beautiful swimming pool experience. The most satisfying thing is to face the beach and the sea. So, this time, I brought my children here specially. The children are very satisfied with the swimming pool and the buffet breakfast. The only regret is that Sanya experienced a typhoon before checking in, and the beach was so rough that they couldn't go into the sea.

msg:I generally don't comment on it. It's acceptable that the hotel is older and the front desk service is pretty good. The problem is in the middle of the night, it's 11 o'clock in the middle of the night, the sound insulation is too poor, I don't know whether it's upstairs or downstairs, the sound of moving furniture, singing, chatting is too loud, and there is the sound of heavy objects falling on the floor. After feedback at the front desk, the waiter told me that it was normal because some passengers checked in late.
If you have environmental requirements, it is not recommended to stay here unless you also go to bed very late. I will not stay at this hotel in the future. I don‚Äôt know why the rating is so high. Maybe the location is okay.

msg:I chose a hotel on the Internet for a long time before, and there were many positive and negative reviews. After staying here, I decided to share with you my experience of staying in the hotel: Maybe many people chose this hotel for the five-star and price like me, and I feel that it is good. There are surprises as well. I have stayed in many five-star hotels, but this is the first one that will not be used due to old facilities and equipment. The hardware is really hard to describe... But I am still willing to give a 5-star rating. The location of the hotel is very good, yes It is a treasured land with good geomantic omens, convenient to travel and very close to the sea, the garden is also very large, the tropical vegetation is well maintained, the supporting facilities are complete, and the sanitation is also carefully cleaned. The most important thing is that the service is good, better than XX Too many, check-in is very considerate, if you ask for help, you can add WeChat one-on-one service, add WeChat to send hotel information and travel guides to guests as soon as possible, unless you need help to contact her, she will not bother you . I am a person who is afraid of bothering others. I have troubled Li Hui, the deputy manager, several times. I wanted to send a small gift as a thank you, but I was declined. Such a thoughtful service must be well-trained. I don‚Äôt want to trouble her, so I will write a review I would like to praise her and thank her for helping me. For the service and price here, choosing this hotel is definitely a great value. If you want a luxurious five-star hotel, you may have to make a detour. I hope it can help everyone.

I didn‚Äôt choose a specific room type and the system defaulted to the double bed room, but it was too crowded for our family of four. There was only one twin room for adjus**ent, and I promised to adjust the room type for me tomorrow, and let me go at noon the next day After seeing the parent-child room type, I still think it is not as good as what my friends said. At this time, the front office manager learned about it and changed it to a sea view room for a retest. The sea view is superb, the two floors are not crowded, and it is very comfortable! The dolls also have a lot of things to play in the hotel, and the food is also very convenient. It is two streets away from the door. Hainan coconut chicken is good.

Seeing that we brought the elderly and children with us, they helped to upgrade the hotel room, and also provided two afternoon teas. The hotel customer service staff It is also polite, and the room is cleaned every day. The hotel has a beautiful environment and has its own garden with many flowers and trees. It is also very leisurely to stroll in the garden. The hotel has its own swimming pool, as well as children's swimming pools, and children's activity facilities. There is a children's playground on the ba*****t floor, and there are different activities every day. The most important thing is that the hotel is very close to the seaside.

Location traffic:

The location of the hotel is very superior. On Haihua Road, there are various restaurants around to meet different needs. There is also a McDonald's directly opposite the hotel. There is a new dq on the first floor of the hotel. You can reach the beach in less than three minutes from the back door of the hotel. If you go back to the hotel from the beach, you can swipe your room card to go in and walk for a minute, and there will be tap water to wash the sand without bringing your feet full of sand back to the room. Going to the left at the entrance to the beach is the swimming area. If you want to be quiet, go to the right. The sand is not as fine as Sanya Bay, but it is very interesting and not boring if you can catch the sea. Go out and take a taxi to Wanghao for 10 minutes, and Luhuitou is almost as close

swimming pool:
There are three and there are various activities for children every day. It is very fulfilling. The swimming pool is changed every day and the water is very clean. There is a swimming pool of 1.4 meters, which is especially suitable for adults and children. Don‚Äôt worry if you can‚Äôt swim.

Serve:
The soft power of the hotel is also very good. From the entrance, helping to open the door and carrying luggage, the guide is very friendly. The front desk and the housekeeping depar**ent are very friendly. I did not encounter any unpleasant situations mentioned in the comments, because the flight with children is still very late. The front desk is also very considerate. Thank you very much for giving us a late check-out, and it is very warm

bed:
I really want to say this. The bed and pillows are too comfortable. I want to buy pillows, but unfortunately the hotel does not have this service. I suggest selling pillows because they are really comfortable. I sleep soundly every night.

When the sun goes down, you can walk directly to the coconut grove and the beach from the back door of the hotel. Facing the sea, enjoying the sunset and sea breeze is really romantic! !

The young guys at the door and on the first floor also provide full marks for their excellent service. I was very dissatisfied with the front desk service on the second floor. Ctrip booked 3 rooms and Ctrip also gave me a breakfast. There happened to be only one person who needed breakfast. However, due to some reasons, the cash card was used to renew the reservation for 3 rooms for 4 days, but breakfast was not provided this time. Suddenly I feel that the hotel did not do enough when I approved this hotel. So I will book Ctrip next time. Because the hotel front desk service is afraid that your Ctrip and other apps will not give you full points, so if you pay with cash and card, it doesn‚Äôt matter whether you give full points or not. Therefore, hotel management needs to be improved. The front desk can give 1 point and the hotel manager can give 0 points.

Hygiene: The sanitation is very good, every corner is clean, there is no musty smell in the room, there is a musty smell in many hotel rooms in Sanya, and the sheets and quilts are also very clean without the smell of disinfectant.

Environment: I just lived in a superior double room, and I can see the swimming pool downstairs. Later, the young lady at the front desk upgraded me to a super sea view suite. I can see the sea in the room. It is a duplex on the second floor. There are two bathrooms.

Service: The ladies at the front desk are very gentle and patient, and their voices are pleasant. I have been here for a few days and saw the lobby cleaned and repaired several times. There are lifeguards and waiters by the pool to maintain hygiene, and there are also gardeners tending flowers and plants in the garden.

The manager at the front desk has the same surname as mine, Mr. Zeng. It happened to be her reception the next time, she is very nice! They gave me afternoon tea and the room was cleaned up after eating, very welcoming! , and the deputy manager at the front desk is still from my hometown, and he is very kind. I regard this as my home in Sanya... But I was a little unhappy at breakfast this morning. I was cooking eggs with the old man. It was too hot. Take the plate. The old man needs to take three or four kinds of medicine for three meals a day. The old man is carrying a small medicine bag. I said it‚Äôs too hot. You put it in the medicine bag for a while and take the plate and put it in the plate. Come here now. A tall chef said, Mom, don't pack it, how much food do you have to prepare every day if you are like you? The old man said, I'm just too hot! My mother's small üíä bag couldn't be zipped up when it contained two eggs. It was left open. How can I pack it? ? , and the old man has diabetes, two eggs and a little greens per meal, the tall chef said a lot, I really want to get angry, the old man pushed me away, wouldn't the chef look at it? I didn‚Äôt listen to the explanation. I was very angry. This is the first time I‚Äôve lived here for several years and felt insulted. I can‚Äôt afford to live in a five-star hotel and can‚Äôt afford eggs? And I stayed here last week, how much can a 75-year-old lady eat? , I want to complain, but the old man refuses to let me. Do you think I will come in the future? The quality of this chef is too poor, I hope he will keep his eyes open in the future and look for trouble... What a disappoin**ent! The front desk pays so much for the hotel and takes care of the guests. Such a chef makes a hotel...! ! ! My good review this time is for the front desk, the chef is bad and bad

Facilities: I thought the decoration was old when I looked at the pictures of Ctrip. In fact, although the bathroom decoration can tell the age, the furniture style is very bright white rural style, which makes people feel at ease. I also thank the front desk for helping to upgrade the 270-degree sea view room, but unfortunately I forgot to take a panoramic view. Enjoy a cup of coffee on the balcony in the morning
Environment: The location of the hotel is excellent. Through the garden, there is a small door directly to the Dadonghai Beach. At the same time, it avoids the main gate of the scenic spot, so you can borrow the illusion of contracting the sea. It's very convenient for takeaway supper, and it's not noisy at night
Service: The attitude of the staff is very good. After returning to the room after breakfast, I met the cleaning staff in the aisle and asked us when it was convenient for us to clean. My daughter whispered to me why this sister speaks so softly. The teammates couldn't get up to bed and eat breakfast, and the restaurant also provided us with takeaway boxes.
There are many lounge chairs around the swimming pool, and there are also swimming rings that can be used at will. The only pity is that the currently open swimming pool has no shade at all, and the baby is dark
Will come again, I hope next time I can have good luck to upgrade the room type

(The waiter at the front desk must be praised for being very polite).
Very disappointed when I saw the room! The room is very small! All the furniture in the room is very shabby. The so-called decoration means that the furniture has been painted with white paint. You can't look at it closely! The tiles on the floor are so dirty that I can't even live there! The shower faucet and toilet door handles are old and rusty! The air conditioner was so loud that I couldn't sleep!
The legendary private beach is actually the public beach behind the hotel (the beach is currently under construction)! There are three swimming pools in the hotel, but only one is open and the others are closed. The waterscape of the hotel has not been cleaned and is very dirty!
The only advantage is that the front desk staff has a very good attitudeüëçThere are many small restaurants around! Eating is convenient!
If you have any requirements for accommodation, please don‚Äôt book this hotel! Really very dirty! !

You can see the blue sea from the room. The back door of the garden leads directly to Dadonghai Beach, so you can play in the sea anytime, anywhere. It is very convenient to eat and buy things around. To go to the First Market, Luhuitou, Xiaodonghai, etc., you can just take a taxi and go. There are also buses to go to Yalong Bay and Sanya Bay far away.
The hotel is an old-fashioned five-star hotel. Although it is not as big as the new five-star hotel, it has everything you need and it is very lively. On the first floor, there are all kinds of amu*****t equipment for children, and there are several good restaurants; the garden downstairs is very large, and the greenery is particularly good. There are many tilapias in the big pool. My son brought the biscuits he brought to feed the fish. It's all gone üòÅ After check-out, there is still a while before going to the airport, so I just enjoyed a complimentary afternoon tea, so cozy!
What impresses me the most is the service of the hotel. Every service staff is polite and friendly, which makes people feel very comfortable.

msg:Twenty years ago, I stayed here with a group of lovely colleagues. Back then, the hotel was only a quasi-five-star hotel, and there were not many people staying there. We all had a good impression of the hotel. We still chose this hotel with the feeling of revisiting the past. But this time I was a little disappointed. The room layout was actually the same as before. It was very small, and the room standard was too different from that of a modern five-star hotel. Half of the sea view room is the sea, and the other half is the hotel, but the hygienic condition is not bad. The front desk patiently gave I looked at several other rooms with the same price, and finally changed to one with a good sea view, but I didn‚Äôt expect to hear the voices next door clearly at night, calling the children to take a bath, quarreling, fighting between brothers, just like in the One room, it was almost 1 o'clock in the middle of the night, I couldn't take it anymore, so I called and asked them to be quiet, and then it calmed down, but the sound continued the next night, I was really speechlessüòì The hotel is a place for people to rest, even the most basic There are problems with the functions of the building, why can't the sound insulation facilities be done well?
In other respects, the breakfast is good, in line with the five-star standard, the attitude of the service staff is also good, the landscaping is very good, but the trees are too high, and the rooms on the lower floors can no longer see the sea. It's a pity that this location, the hotel facing the sea, overall In other words, the evaluation of 4.8 points is not in line.
Facilities: 2.5 points
Health: 4.8 points
Environment: 4.6 points
Service: 5 points

Later, I brought my parents to Sanya for a trip, where I also lived in Yintai. This is the third time I have stayed at Intime, three times, and I have never been disappointed. The service is very good, the hotel environment is also very beautiful, the location is in the center of Dadonghai, and it is very convenient to go out. The beach is right outside the hotel, and because it is the beach at the back door of the hotel, there are relatively few people. After playing with sand, you can dilute it when you enter the door. The hotel pool is also very clean.

msg:This hotel is in Dadonghai, it should be an old hotel. So when I first arrived at the hotel, I felt a bit old at first. After staying for two days, I gradually discovered that this hotel is good. First of all, it is the location. It is very close to the beach and various places to eat, and it is full of fireworks. The second is the service. Many guests are with children and the elderly. Overall, they are quite enthusiastic, especially the little brother in charge of the swimming pool, who takes good care of the children. Breakfast is also ok. There is also a coconut chicken shop on the first floor, which is very convenient. The disadvantages are also obvious. The room is not big and the sound insulation is poor, and the noise of the children lasts for a long time. When guests from other floors take a bath in the bathroom, there will be a lot of noise that should be resonance, and it will last for a while. But in general, if the requirements for the hotel are not very high, it is worth the money.

msg:It is a very old-fashioned hotel. The advantage is that it is located in the core area of Dadonghai, which is very convenient. It only takes a minute to go downstairs and walk to the beach, but it is a very speechless check-in experience. If you want a high-floor room with a good view, please contact us in advance. The hotel communicated, because the time of arrival at the store was around 7:00 p.m., the front desk staff thought that the male waiter had given two rooms to look at, and was not satisfied after reading it. They came back and communicated that there were no other rooms for tonight. A sea view room with a balcony was given to the later guests to see the room. I was really speechless. I had no choice but to live in a low-floor room without a balcony. The front desk staff did not apologize at all. The only solution was The next morning, I checked to see if I could change a room (booked for three nights). The next day, I took my luggage and went downstairs to store it at the front desk, and successfully changed to a room with a balcony. The cleanliness of the room is relatively sloppy, the floor has stains that cannot be cleaned, the toilet is really in disrepair, the phone wants to add a few more bottles of water, the male waiter at the front desk once again sneered that he can only give two bottles a day, and then sent them over, I don‚Äôt know Why are the hotel waiters in Sanya so pissed at the guests, I am speechless.

It is very convenient to go out to Dadonghai Park. It is very convenient to eat and play around. The restaurant and bar street are within easy reach. It is also 10 yuan to take a taxi to Big Pineapple, which is convenient for shopping and watching movies. I also went to Luhuitou Park, which is also very close.
There are many varieties of breakfast, but there are many people and you have to come early, and many things are slow to be replenished. The only disadvantage is that the waiters in the breakfast area have difficulty in communicating with non-standard Mandarin, and they ignore questions and answers.

Hygiene: the room is clean
Service: The ladies at the front desk are very nice.
Environment: The hotel's own swimming pool is very good.
The travel photos sent are good! Other projects did not try
Summary: If you don't have too high requirements for the hotel, you can choose it with a convenient location and a moderate price.

Especially in the evening sitting on the balcony blowing the evening breeze
Listening to the sound of the sea, watching the sunset, very pleasant

First of all, the location of the hotel is very good, right on the beach, very close at hand, and secondly, the overall service and reception of the hotel are warm and polite! And the hotel sometimes surprises you, such as upgrading my room! Although the room setting is a bit outdated, the details are in place, and it is clean and hygienic! Like üëç!
In addition, it is necessary to mention the yacht that the hotel cooperates with to go to sea! I also chose Ha because of time constraints, but the experience is very bad! What is free often comes at a greater cost later! Gather everyone on the first floor, turn on the stereo very loudly, and brainwash those with Northeast accents. Upgrades to the second and third floors cost 150 yuan to bring red wristbands. Those who do not upgrade can only stay on the first floor. The key It is an indirect hint in various languages, etc. I feel that my dignity as a person has been humiliated without an upgrade! Who would have his dignity hurt if he really came out to play? So the result is that most of them have been upgraded, the key is that there are only a few simple dining tables on the third floor! It can only be said that the boat is average! Because first of all, I told you that you want to dive, no money! But it costs 160 yuan to rent a mask, and the time is extremely short! Go into the sea and use your fear and ignorance to talk about adding money to take pictures and videos! Instead of talking first! ! There is still a wave of harvest on the return trip, and there is a handsome boy with a Northeast accent playing a special 20 yuan crystal lottery! Hey, all kinds of tricks trick you, the experience is really bad! It is very not strong for everyone to experience it, and the money you want to play can completely play better! Everyone do their own strategy Ha! This is a low score for the hotel. It is recommended that the hotel choose a partner carefully! Hope everyone is doing well!

It's a pity that I missed the BBQ on the first floor this time. I'll make it up next time.
It‚Äôs very close to Summer Depar**ent Store. There‚Äôs a McDonald‚Äôs opposite the DQ downstairs. There are also small shops on the street where you can shop and eat.
The hotel has a lot of cute kittens who come out to exchange food with guests during breakfast. I like it so much
The greenery here is also very good. It‚Äôs like walking in a garden. The small door leads to the sea. There are many bars and restaurants by the sea at night.

The hotel is really unexpectedly good. The first thing that surprises me is the service. Because I often travel on business, I have stayed in hotels all over the country, but the service of Yintai Sunshine is the warmest. I arrived at the hotel at night, and the receptionist was still full of energy. I was warmly received. Any questions are answered patiently. The next day, I strolled around in the hotel garden. There were beautiful scenery everywhere. I took a few random photos. I especially liked the fish raised in the lake. Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt bring any fish food. I would like to share some photos for everyone to see...

The children are jumping up and down happily on the bed.
There is a well-maintained tropical garden downstairs, and you can go directly to the beach through the garden. The beach on Intime is very clean. Basically, there are only tourists staying in Intime, and there are fewer people. Children can run on the big beach to their heart's content. We can also sit on the beach and enjoy the sea view.
The staff are also very enthusiastic. The lady at the front desk offered to help us upgrade the suite, and the auntie cleaned it very cleanly.
All in all, it was a great stay experience.

Valuable, many details are kept as they were in 2003, and they are well maintained. It's really amazing. Although the facilities are old, she has everything that should be there. It gives people a magical sense of belonging. How can I say it? like home? Hahaha, the most amazing thing is that she also has the first-line sea view of other high-end hotels. It is really beautiful. What you see is what you get. The most important thing is that her price is really affordable. Other high-end hotels with the same sea view in Dadonghai are all 1k To start, and Sunshine Intime Resort Hotel only needs about 300, I don't need to say, you all know who is the first choice, Yintai! I'm really at a loss for words, really, but I will give it to my friends and let them experience it for themselves. I believe they will not be disappointed. You can always trust Intime!
On the right side of the hotel is the East China Sea Dragon Palace and on the left side is the Summer Depar**ent Store. It is a business district. On the first floor of the hotel, there is a Thai restaurant and Ye Xiaoji. There is also a Dairy Queen opposite the hotel. There are also convenience stores near McDonald's. It is very convenient in Sanya. Intime is the only one I know that has such an excellent location and the price is so affordable.
(Suggestion: I originally lived in Building A, but later moved to Building C. It is obvious that the air-conditioning system of Building C is not as good as Building A. In this midsummer time, air-conditioning is very important.)

msg:Speaking of Dadonghai, the first thing that flashes in my memory is this hotel, with its convenient location, beautiful scenery, professional service and comfortable stay, Yintai Sunshine has become a must-have for every visit to Sanya.
Transportation: It is very convenient to go to any scenic spot. Buses, taxis, and online car-hailing can be used at any time. The hotel is very close to Big Pineapple and Summer Depar**ent Store. There are also supermarkets that locals go to, so it is very convenient to eat and live.
Hygiene: Because of the children, the room is inevitably messy, but every time it is cleaned, it is immediately restored.
Environment: The environment is the highlight of the hotel. It takes less than three minutes for the hotel to go to the beach. The children came back very close after playing with the sand, and they returned happily almost every day. The garden landscape of the hotel itself is also very characteristic. The plants are dense and delicate, which makes people feel as if they are in a tropical rain forest, and has a very holiday a**osphere.
Service: The hotel's service is very good, because the flight was late and it was already very late. I didn't expect that the car just stopped, the concierge would come to pick up the luggage and guide him upstairs; the check-in at the front desk was very neat, watching us bring My child, I was upgraded to a family room for free. Compared with the efficiency of check-in at the later hotel, I really like it a lot. There were many people at breakfast, and the restaurant waiter turned the table quickly. This is a family with a strong human touch. The hotel, whether in the early morning or in the middle of the night, the waiter you meet at any time will take the initiative to greet you, making people feel warm. The housekeeping staff were very quick to deliver clothes hangers or change garbage bags. When I left, I left something behind. After contacting the hotel, he quickly helped me find it and delivered it to the hotel in Yalong Bay for free. Even when I asked to thank him for his nomination, he politely declined my kindness and just let me It's good to write down the experience of staying truthfully, and I was really moved by such an attitude.
The hotel also has a lot of extra points, such as rich breakfast, such as the air conditioning in the room is very cool, such as the thoughtful preparation of drying racks, such as chairs in the elevator room, although the hotel is older than the newly opened hotel facilities, the decoration is a bit outdated, But the flaws do not hide the truth. I think that when I go on vacation, I want to be comfortable. Because I am very satisfied with the service of the hotel, we booked another two days later, just to have a successful start and end of the trip to Sanya. Since I have stayed many times, I didn't take any photos. Anyway, the photos of the room are consistent with the pictures.

At that time, we told a young man at the front desk that it would be very noisy facing the elevator. I said no, but after 12 o'clock in the evening, the guests would speak loudly when they came back, and it was very noisy at 7 o'clock in the morning. I went to the front desk the next day, and a man named Pan Yan had a very good attitude, and finally gave us a room. The decoration of the room is very poor, the TV is too small to speak, and the room is not equipped with a conditioner. There are very few varieties of breakfast, and there are very few meat dishes. Finally, there is a shrimp, and one is still not fresh. The fruit is even more wanting to complain. The cantaloupe has no sweetness at all, and it is underripe. There are only two swimming pools, very small, and the price/performance ratio is too low. I have stayed in Dadonghai many times, and it is really the worst hotel.

Very satisfied with every place! !
The room is clean: I read the reviews for a long time before I checked in. In fact, I was still a little worried about the internal environment of the hotel, but after entering the room, my concerns were eliminated. The room was very clean and the facilities felt quite new. It is estimated that it has been refurbished in recent years. . The room is very big! The bed is huge! Coupled with the invincible sea view window, the mood is directly full! ! !
Complete facilities: The hotel has a swimming pool, which is quite clean. There is a small road leading to the seaside, but the seaside is not very clean, and the waves are relatively large. It is recommended to nest in the swimming pool.
Eating convenience: Because it is in the urban area, the surrounding area is very convenient, and the 18 bowls are particularly affordable. You must eat it. The Hunanese certification is very authentic. The stir-fried dishes at Chongqing Noodle House are also delicious.
Convenient transportation: Because it is far from Yemeng Corridor, and when I go to Haiyue Square, the sunset is absolutely incredible, so I feel that I don‚Äôt have to go to Yemeng. It's a pity that I only stayed for one night and didn't have time to go to Luhuitou.
    [All in all] Great value in Dadonghai! Great value! Great value! Say it three times. The sea in Yalong Bay is more beautiful, but the facilities in the hotel are not as good. Dadonghai can be the first stop of Sanya travel, Dadonghai must come to this hotel 55555

5. In the typhoon day, everything in the hotel was normal. After breakfast, I slept in the room listening to the sound of the waves. The old man accompanied the children to the Children's Paradise on the first floor. It was a lot of fun, especially the Children's Paradise clean! If there are elderly and children, it is very important to choose a good hotel!
6. If you don't want to bring skin care products, you can buy them in the hotel shop. It's very cheap and has no tariffs, but they are all Japanese cosmetic brands. There are many travel clothes and baby products, so you can reduce your luggage!
7. The hotel's soap is super easy to use, the hand washing is fragrant, not dry, not slippery, and the key to washing clothes is also super good, the oil stains on the baby's clothes will be clean after a gentle wash, love!

Generally speaking, staying in an old five-star hotel with a price in the early 300s is relatively cost-effective, the rooms are clean, the towels are soft, and the breakfast is basically a five-star standard. Most waiters can take the initiative to greet guests when they see them. It is understandable that it is closed or semi-open, but the gym starts service at 8:30 in the morning, which is indeed a bit inappropriate. One of the advantages of staying here is that there are many restaurants around the hotel, so you don't always have to eat at the hotel. The water and beaches of the Dadonghai Sea are the best in the year from June to September and from November to February, and the clarity can reach 1 meter. However, at present, the hotel does not have its own private beach, which needs to be considered.

The service is good, the environment is beautiful, the hygiene is good, and you can reach the beach after crossing the garden. Children like it very much. There are indoor and outdoor playgrounds for children, and they teach guests to swim at night. The free course is amazing.

msg:Very very satisfied! This time I came here to see the sea~ It's really good to choose this Intime! It is a very connotative five-star hotel! The little brother at the front desk took the initiative to upgrade our sea view room to a deluxe sea view room. The view from the room is really beautiful! There is no exaggeration in the propaganda picture! It's the real scenery! The swimming pool is particularly clean and constant temperature ~ the swimming ring and water polo are all provided by the hotel ~ I strongly recommend the hotel's private garden! Year-round well-tended tropical gardens! Really beautiful! Passing through the garden, the big leaves gradually fade away and the private beach is imprinted in the eyes. It is really a dreamy scenery in my mind! Everyone is right~ Yintai may not have the latest facilities, but the sense of belonging he brings to us is unprecedented! I like it very much~ Our whole family said that we will come to Sanya in the future! I still want to live here~ Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è!

3. Only one swimming pool in the hotel is open, and the temperature is cold in winter. We will go to you for a while at noon.
4. There are fewer recreational facilities in parent-child hotels, but the price can‚Äôt be too picky

6. Eat near where you live, travel is very convenient, you can go anywhere with a bus

I just walked to the hotel door and found that I forgot to bring a mask. He was saying to go upstairs to get it. Come here, Zan Zan Zan ~ floor staff service is also very good, friendly attitude. In short, I feel that the staff of this hotel are very good, and I will continue to stay decisively. There are many snack bars around.

The scenery is excellent, the location is excellent, and the service is excellent! This year, due to the impact of the epidemic in various places, there are relatively few tourists, but the hotel service and quality have not declined at all! The front desk has upgraded the sea view room. The feeling of facing the sea is really great. The room is not damp at all, and the bedding is clean and hygienic. Only in such a hygienic environment can you rest assured to bring your baby!
There are a lot of green plants in the park downstairsü™¥, the water in the swimming pool is crystal clear, children have to play in the swimming pool for a long time every day, and there are children's play facilities next to the swimming pool, even if you don't go to the beach, your baby can have a good time in the park ! Definitely a hotel suitable for children to stay in! If you bring your baby, you must take more photos in the park, every corner is very good!
In terms of service, whether it is the front desk or customer service üíÅ waiters, they are all responsive and courteous.

As soon as I arrived in Hainan, I caught up with the Sanya epidemic
So in addition to the places where Sanya can play, it can be considered a play.
When I was about to leave Sanya, Sanya was fine.
Then you have to go there, or you always feel like you are missing something if you come to Hainan or not to Sanya.
The first hotel I found in Sanya was
Intime Sunshine Resort Hotel
The reason why I chose this place is because it has a beautiful sea view room and a family room suitable for our family of three
Hotel room with separate baby bed
The bed is designed in the shape of a bow, and the walls are covered with cute little fish and paddles, which adds a lot of fun to the baby before going to bed
The hotel has a separate large swimming pool
If there are many people, you can also play water basketball
Babies can play in shallow water under the supervision of adults
What I like the most is the location
Not only a variety of food in the hotel
There are also various specialties around the hotel
A few dozen meters from the hotel is the seaside
This place can not only satisfy the demand for scenery, but also satisfy my taste buds
Stayed in a hotel for one month in a row in Hainan
The price/performance ratio here is chao high.
Friends who come to Sanya to travel can be included in the travel list

A local friend in Sanya recommended the Dadonghai Yintai Sunshine Resort Hotel because of its superior location, convenient transportation, five-star first-line sea view with a per capita cost of about 200üí∞, and a rich buffet breakfast [Like R] [Like R] [Like R]
‚úîÔ∏èI chose this one because of the environment and the super cost-effectiveness.
üè†Sanya Intime Sunshine Resort Hotel
üìçNo. 88, Haihua Road, Dadonghai Tourist Area, Jiyang District, Sanya
The hotel is very big and someone will help you with your luggage as soon as you enter.
The service is really excellent, and the epidemic prevention and control measures are also very good.
Each passenger is equipped with a peace of mind package,
There are disinfectant wipes, masks and more.
Even if we forget to bring our room card, a smart robot will deliver the goods without contact.
It's so smart and so considerate.
We stayed in a 270-degree panoramic ocean view room.
First-class sea view, the room is surrounded by the sea on three sides and surrounded by tropical plants
Facing the sea, spring flowers are blooming, sitting on the balcony and enjoying the wind is so comfortable
The mattress is a zero-pressure bedüõèIt‚Äôs super comfortable to sleep on
There are also hotel catering, breakfast buffet, coffee shop, Chinese restaurant, Thai restaurant, DQ, etc. on the first floor.
If it‚Äôs not so hot in the afternoon, you can go to the garden downstairs for a walk.
Enjoy nature‚Äôs natural oxygen bar
There are three swimming pools to choose from,
There are also children's playgrounds, expansion areas, gyms, etc.
You can go directly to the beach from the back door of the hotel with your room card.
Breeze and watch the sunset at the beach, surrounded by Dadonghai Night Market
There are also many snacks and so on that are popular among internet celebrities.
After staying for two days in a row, I woke up to a ceremonial breakfast buffet.
Dozens of meals to choose from
The most important thing is that it is very cost-effective
It‚Äôs perfect for friends to stay here during their vacation or family trip.
Share it with friends who want to travel in the off-season~

It is said that the Dragon Palace (restaurant) on this street is a star check-in shop, and there is also a "tip of the tongue..." restaurant next to it. Really lively.

msg:This is the third time I have stayed at the Intime Resort Hotel. The service of the hotel is still good. This time, we mainly brought our five-year-old children to the hotel. The children like the hotel's children's playground and swimming pool very much. The children used to be three years old here. On my birthday, the hotel gave me a birthday cake at that time. Children also like to come to Yintai Hotel to play. We stayed at the Yalong Bay Hotel for a week and came to the Intime Hotel.
       The price we stayed at the Intime Hotel was 490 yuan for the wallet breakfast. The quality and variety of the hotel's breakfast was very good, and we stayed in a sea view room, which was the cheapest price I've ever stayed at in Intime. I like swimming and running, so I feel that Intime's swimming pool is still very good, plus the weather in Sanya is very comfortable, I swim in the hotel every day and my friends have fun in the swimming pool and children's playground.
       I am very grateful to the master Wu in the parking lot for making the floor mat this time. I forgot a small plastic square box on the back cover when I was doing business. It was filled with children's books and toys. The next afternoon I found that the box was missing. . Mr. Wu was on duty in the parking lot at the time. He asked me about the characteristics of the box and gave it back to me. Thank you very much, Mr. Wu, indicating that Yintai's safety protection work is still very good, and I will bring it next time. When my kids or I come to Sanya for the Sanya Marathon, I will still go to the Intime Hotel.

I went to the main desk to change a room, and the scenery was fine, but the air conditioner in the room was frozen to death, no matter what. No matter how I adjusted it, it was maintained at 20 degrees. I came back at night and changed a room. As a result, the air conditioner in this room was extremely hot. It was set at 23 degrees and kept at 28 degrees. I really took it.
The overall feeling is the same as that of the Express Hotel. The room is small and short, very depressing, and the hardware facilities are very poor, not even a usb charging port!

It is close to the beach and has three swimming pools, which are suitable for people of different ages. Because of the epidemic, I haven't been to Sanya for a long time. This time I found that there is an outdoor children's playground, trampolines and so on. The children like it very much. The breakfast is very rich, and my parents are used to it. The waiters are very enthusiastic, especially the lady at the front desk is super nice, the service is very thoughtful, and they also sent a minibar and welcome fruit on the first day, so we resolutely booked here for 12 days, and slept until I woke up naturally every day. Let's spend it this way!

I thought I would change the hotel if I couldn't stay for one night, but I was really pleasantly surprised. Personal feeling The twin room will be more hygienic. The twin room is reserved. If you bring a child, the two beds will be combined. Unexpectedly, the housewife not only changes new sheets every day, but also flattens the gap between the two beds. The double bed sheets put the two bedspreads together. If it wasn't for checking out and separating the two beds, I hadn't discovered this detail. I was really moved by this detail, so I put it in the previous comment. The reason why I stayed here is: 1. Hygiene Clean, spacious rooms, easy to dry on the balcony, 2. The swimming pool entertainment facilities are complete, three large and small swimming pools, hammocks, children's entertainment facilities, etc., free beach toys to borrow, provide swimming rings, etc. 3.

msg:A great experience! When I first made the strategy, I took a fancy to the location of the hotel in Dadonghai, in the center of many scenic spots in Sanya. It is very convenient whether to go east or west. The hotel is located at the seaside, passing through the tropical garden, you can reach the beach, experience swimming, walking the waves, watching the sunset and listening to the sea tide. The location is ideal for travelers who don‚Äôt want to run around.

There are many places to eat and shop around. Less than one kilometer away from the hotel, there are many seafood, Sichuan, and Northeastern restaurants. Because there are many residents nearby, the price is fair. When we left, we bought some specialty products and packed fruits to take home. The overall price was not expensive. The room is clean and tidy, and the layout is perfect. Open the window and you can see the beautiful Dadonghai and the rabbit's tail mountain in the distance. The decoration style is a bit tropical South Asian style, simple and elegant without losing the mood. The standard of breakfast and the dining environment are definitely five-star, and we often see the warm pictures of white foreigners dragging their homes. The room service is attentive, whether it is the doorman or the receptionist, they are very professional and very comfortable, revealing the old five-star heritage.

Sisters, think about getting up in the morning and opening the window. What you see is the endless sea. How happy it isü•∞
This time I finally experienced it myself‚úåÔ∏è

üè®: Sanya Yintai Sunshine Resort Hotel
üè®: No. 88, Haihua Road, Dadonghai Tourist Resort
This is really the most cost-effective hotel among Sanya‚Äôs five-star hotels~
When you open the window, you can see the endless sea, which is really refreshing.
The decoration of the lobby is also very nice, it feels like a palace.
The Chris**as a**osphere is also very strong, which makes me want to go to Sanya again for Chris**as.
We booked a twin room this time. Compared with ordinary hotels, in addition to the twin beds, there is a lot of free space. The room is very large and the bed is very comfortable.
Family members, don‚Äôt talk much. Go out for a walk while you are young. The images in your mind will never disappear.

msg:I booked a suite of more than 2,800. I thought it was a 5 star hotel. The service and environment should be good. However, when the front desk checked in, we said that we can only check in after 3 o'clock. I wanted to ask. Because of the epidemic, there were not many people. My room was the best and most expensive in their hotel. I came for the bbq in the garden downstairs. However, after I checked in, I was informed in the afternoon that there were not many passengers and it was not open. I aimed at them The so-called private beach came, but it turned out to be the public beach next to the Dadonghai Sea. I really came here for the third time. I really think it‚Äôs not as good as the Hawaii hotel next to it. More than 400 is much better than this 2,800. I was originally to take my family to enjoy it. Yes, it turned out that I was mad, and the room was very shabby. Some Starbucks also had photo items including items when they were scheduled. They were actually the coupons they gave, and then they didn‚Äôt tell me the time. I was anxious to check in and didn‚Äôt watch it. , I called in the afternoon and asked people about the time. I was speechless. In the end, I asked Ctrip to withdraw the room for one day. Because the two days were booked, I stayed for 1 day and haven‚Äôt arrived. The result was too disappointing. Ctrip negotiated with the hotel. The hotel came to the hotel and did not give a refund, saying that I had booked the best one, and I could not help find a better room. If you say that you are full, I will bear it, and it will delay your room reservation rate. The problem is You didn‚Äôt have a lot of occupancy rate, so it‚Äôs just a shame. I angrily told Ctrip customer service that I don‚Äôt want this day‚Äôs room money. It was very good. She understood. Indeed, all my reactions are true. The final result is that I can check out, and half of my room charge will be deducted by more than 1,400. To be honest, if I feel sorry for the money, I will bear it. The problem is that their attitude makes people feel bad I was so angry, I went straight away, and somehow deducted me 1400. Ctrip also felt that I was aggrieved, and gave me a 200 voucher, which is really comforting, but this is the hotel I have stayed in. The worst one, poor attitude, poor work, not like a 5-star, I think the chain hotels on the roadside are better than this.

Beach towels and beach slippers are prepared, including children‚Äôs slippers and pajamas. Such a deliberate five-star hotel, but the price is a three-star fee, and the price/performance ratio is so high that it is overwhelming. The surrounding area is full of food, drink and shopping. There are a variety of specialties on the first floor of the hotel, and the prices are relatively close to the people. Thanks to Xiao Zhang at the front desk for his warm reception and upgraded our guest rooms for free. The morning sun slowly rises from the sea, the first ray of sunlight slowly enters the room, and the door of the balcony is opened. What you see is the vast sea and the beautiful sandy beach. This feeling is really wonderful. If you are discouraged by hotel prices in Yalong Bay, come to the Yintai Sunshine Resort Hotel in Dadong Bay, which will definitely give you a cost-effective experience.

For 300 per person, you can enjoy a super deluxe ocean view room that opens to the sea! You just say it's worth it!

The holiday-style design room is fresh and bright, clean and tidy, the point is! Open the curtains and lie on the bed to see the sea! The garden is very large, and it is connected to the beach, so it is suitable for taking pictures. There is also a large swimming pool in the hotel, which is very clean, and there are many beautiful swimming laps. I learned to swim here. Hahaha~ There is also a parent-child paradise.

[Accommodation experience] Very good! The beach bag and two sets of slippers prepared in the guest room are really considerate and convenient to go to the beach. What moved me the most was the service~ the young ladies at the front desk were very enthusiastic, with sweet smiles, and responsive~! The room is cleaned every day. When you leave, you will be provided with a small package such as a mask, which is very considerate~
To
[Transportation location] Located in Dadonghai, it is very convenient to take a taxi to the first market, and the transportation is very convenient~!
There is also a lot to eat around the hotel. Enjoy the tranquility of leisure and vacation in the hotel. You can feel the vitality of the coastal city when you leave the hotel. Compared with Haitang Bay, the smoke and fire here are heavier.

Floor-to-ceiling glass windows can see the sea at a glance
Location and taxi are very convenient. Self-driving trips and car rentals in Sanya are equal to free parking lot, which is very cost-effective.
If we want to spend a good time and watch the sea, we ordered a full sea view room. Opening the door is a pleasant surprise. The entire bay is in front of you! !
I really like this room, floor-to-ceiling glass on three sides, whether you are lying down, on a recliner or taking a bath, you can see the sea.
Or sitting on the balcony blowing the sea breeze, drinking Starbucks from the hotel, it‚Äôs very relaxing
Feeling always surrounded by the gentle sunshine, sea and coconut grove, this kind of holiday feeling is rare and very popular. It's a cleansing of body and soul

Cleaning up 2 times a day keeps the whole room clean and hygienic, and the waiter also carefully helps us organize the scattered clothes and items. This kind of service is simply super five-star, thank you
This is really sweet
For those with cleanliness and obsessive-compulsive disorder
The room is clean at any time to make people feel happy, especially the moment the door is opened, love.
Pillow slippers can also be chosen according to your own preferences, I love it
In particular, I also gave us cute small shells and conch pendants, full of details, this kind of meticulous love Ô∏è
Satisfaction up up up üíØ 100%
The sisters who come to Sanya from Yintai Sunshine Resort Sanya, close their eyes!
I saw many types of rooms in his house, such as family parent-child rooms, duplex suites, and so on, but I still recommend this full sea view room, about 1000 including breakfast, Starbucks and yacht day trips and other super value, I love it! This time I came to know that there will be activities in the hotel direct booking, sisters can contact the hotel to have a look.

Finally stayed in the most satisfactory five-star resort hotel
@Sanya Yintai Sunshine Holiday Hotel
High school students and local residents who work in Sanya also recommend safe and secure hotels
The hotel is located in the heart of Dadonghai
Convenient transportation is very convenient wherever you want to go
It‚Äôs very close to Luhuitou and Mid-Levels Peninsula
There is also a shuttle bus to Haitang Bay Duty Free Shop. Hotel guests are free. Remember to make an appoin**ent with the hotel one day in advance.
Nearby are McDonald‚Äôs, Lawson, IKEA convenience stores, etc. There are also many hot restaurants, gourmet shops and shopping malls, one-stop food, drink, housing and transportation

What attracts me most is the hotel‚Äôs private exclusive beach with a sense of luxuryüèñÔ∏èTropical private garden
I feel like I can't finish playing in the hotel for two or three days
Lovers' pavilions, big hammocks, beach chairs and other hotels in the garden are free for tourists staying in the rest area üÜì
The green plants surround the beautiful environment, and the production of the film is simply a must
Full of tropical rainforest a**osphere
A casual group is a blockbuster that maxes out the high-level sense of the circle of friends
Hotel swimming pool water quality is very clean
I like to observe, I found that there is a swimming ring and lifebuoy in the children‚Äôs area, and you can go straight to the beach by walking along the garden üèñÔ∏è

üöó Transportation: The hotel is located in Dadonghai. There are various shops, supermarkets and restaurants downstairs. It is super convenient, and you can directly reach the beach through the back garden of the hotel. It is very close. The hotel also has exclusive beach chairs and there are not many people.
üßπSanitation: Sanitation still reaches the five-star standard. Although the hotel is very long, there are no mosquitoes.
üçÉEnvironment: The overall furniture is slightly outdated, but the overall cost performance is super high, and the environment is also very clean and tidy. There is a large children's pool, and there are special people on the beach who can lead you to catch crabs. The experience is very good.
üîîService: The sister at the front desk is very nice. She helped us upgrade the sea-view twin room for free, with a small terrace. After the child slept, my husband and I would enjoy the sea breeze and drink beer on the terrace. It was very pleasant. In short, I strongly recommend Yintai Sunshine , Will choose here next time!

This is really a hotel with a view of the sea
The so-called spring blossoms facing the sea means this feeling!
The hotel has its own swimming pool and beach, the equipment is very complete, and the attitude of the front desk staff is also very good.
A good blockbuster can be shot on a lounger in the pool.
The hotel is surrounded by tropical gardens and green bananas can be seen everywhere, giving people a sense of infinite comfort.
There is also a small conch pendant on the bedside of the hotel, which is full of details.
.
The lot of the hotel is a night market at night when you go out.
From check-in to staying in the store, there are very good humane measures.
My favorite is the room facing the sea, whether it is sunny or rainy, it makes people feel particularly comfortable and warm.
In the evening is the lively night market downstairs, listening to the sound of the sea breeze and eating supper!
.
Their buffet is also delicious and rich in variety.
The bread and snacks for breakfast are very good, and more importantly, you can go to the yacht when you stay at their house.
You can experience all kinds of extreme water sports.

Every detail is delivered in place, everything is carefully confirmed one by one, and a clear explanation of the room type will be made ( Because the hotel has a special structure and a variety of room types, so when you book a room, you can decide according to your needs. Although the staff will help with reasonable upgrades, I think this is very human). Very good experience.

This time we got up for breakfast. The breakfast buffet was very rich and there were many small snacks with local characteristics in Hainan. It is recommended that everyone dine on the terrace outside the breakfast room. The garden is surrounded by a breeze and you can hear frogs and birds. The ecological environment is great.
There is a Starbucks service point on the first floor of the hotel. When you check in, the front desk gave you a Starbucks drink voucher. Drinking coffee and looking at the beautiful scenery out of the window, I really enjoyed it

The front desk staff gave me the impression of enthusiasm. The hotel has a private swimming pool and complete amu*****t facilities. The breakfast is rich in variety, and the waiters are very enthusiastic. What is worth sharing is that the coffee coupons given to Starbucks at the front desk of this hotel can be obtained for free on the first floor of the hotel, awesome! After dinner in the evening, you can go to the hotel beach to catch crabs with the children, blow the sea breeze, and play on the beach together is a very good choice. I strongly recommend that you will choose to stay next time!

üöó Transportation:

I think the most important thing about staying in a hotel is comfort, safety and location.
The location of Yintai is quite superior. It is extremely convenient to travel to the surrounding scenic spots. You don't have to worry about dinner and supper when you come back. The hotel also provides supper and the price is very affordable.

üîîService:

By the way, we must compliment two points:
1. The hotel's epidemic prevention and control is in place, and a peace of mind gift bag with masks and disinfectant cotton pads is also provided during check-in;
2. The hotel will arrange swimming instruction courses, please be sure to praise the coach who works in the swimming pool on the afternoon of August 20! Because of his patient guidance, from a person who is particularly afraid of water, I have been familiar with water in just one hour and developed a strong interest in swimming. This is an unexpected surprise that the hotel has given me in addition to its excellent hardware facilities.
Next time I come to Sanya to play, I also want to live in Yintai Hotel, play with the coach, and like to try this zero-pressure room.

msg:As a travel veteran, I stayed in Yintai for three days from August 5th to 8th. The first two days of Chaohao Seaview were purchased through the hotel's mini program, so it could not be displayed on the Ctrip app. I ordered a premium twin bed through Ctrip on the last night. Based on the principle of not blowing or black, objective and fair, we seriously comment on Yintai Sunshine Hotel, hoping to provide a comment with rational reference value for the majority of netizens. Let‚Äôs first talk about the advantages: 1. Our room for the first two nights includes pick-up service. Since the flight from Shanghai to Sanya that day requires a centralized nucleic acid test at the airport, the pick-up master waited for more than an hour, and finally sent us to the hotel. , No complaints, like it! Second, although the super luxury sea view room is not directly facing the sea, the balcony has a good view. Third, the hotel is very close to the beach, and the beach is at the back of the hotel. During the epidemic, there were very few people. Fourth, the breakfast is good, both Chinese and Western. Although not outstanding, it has reached the five-star standard. Next, let‚Äôs talk about the shortcomings: the hotel‚Äôs external environment is not good. Check in is on the second floor. The first floor is a commercial street similar to an indoor shopping mall. Although it is somewhat convenient in a sense, it directly leads to the appearance of the hotel lobby and door. A budget hotel does not look like a five-star hotel at all. Second, the so-called super luxury sea view room is not directly facing the sea, but on the side. Especially, in order to have a few more sea view rooms, the size of the sea view room is very very, super super cramped, comparable to Motel 168. On the last day, I changed a high-standard room that was only half the price of Chaohao Seaview, and the area was much larger. Third, the facilities are really outdated, and the sound of the air conditioner is comparable to that of a tractor. Friends who have a bad sleep must be cautious. Fourth, only one of the three so-called 3,000-square-meter swimming pools advertised was actually opened. Of course, the driving environment is good, coconut grove clear water, unique flavor, but this is the standard configuration of Sanya hotels, and there is nothing to praise. Fifth, the hotel's details are not well done. To give two examples, 1. The hotel has a lotus pond, but the water has turned yellow, indicating neglect of maintenance. 2. After learning that my experience in Yintai was not good, the customer service manager of the hotel actively contacted me, sending the travel kits and arrange the airport to send the things to the Yalong Bay Guest Hotel (we stayed in Yintai for three days) Yalong Guest House also stayed for three days) I am not there, the courier brother called me and said that the courier is payable. Of course, I confiscated things, and I didn't ask for the red envelopes for courier fees sent by the account manager. At the end of the drop-off, we had our own full-time driver for the chartered car, and we didn't have to take the carpool that they gave away. Although we don't take people so we don't speak softly, we speak the truth. However, the so-called compensation of the hotel management staff has not been implemented, which reflects their service level from a certain angle. Objectively speaking, although Intime does have some advantages in some places, the shortcomings can cover the disadvantages. During the epidemic, when other hotels have drastically reduced prices, the small, screw-like, so-called sea-view room still charges 644 a day (1288). Two days) is very unreasonable. The double bbq in the set meal originally said that because of the epidemic, it was changed to a three-course and one-soup Chinese meal. It was unpalatable. The waiter in the Chinese restaurant had a blunt attitude. In addition, if the buffet bbq is cancelled due to the epidemic, why not cancel your buffet breakfast? Under the guise of the epidemic, you changed the package content without authorization, which actually brought losses to the customer, but you did not make the slightest compensation, and things were not beautiful. An objective and fair evaluation, Yintai Sunshine Hotel should be between 3.5 and 3.8 points, 4.7 points are very watery, I hope to attract the attention of all friends.

The pool was ok, with all kinds of inflatable toys (should be hotel, everyone takes turns anyway) and the kids loved it.
Breakfast is OK, and the children's playground is good.
The massage that the group buys is actually the store outside. It takes a few minutes to walk, and only sends 15-20 minutes, and has to make an appoin**ent. This is a chicken rib, obviously it is to guide the massage shop, and I am too lazy to go.

It may be the peak tourist season, so the front desk service cannot be complimented. It is an understatement to say it is terrible. There are many varieties of breakfast, but it is recommended to improve the presentation.

msg:I lived in Yintai in 2004. This time I brought my children to Sanya and considered Yalong Bay. I have lived in Haitang Bay. I chose Yintai again when I lived in Dadonghai and felt Sanya. This time I feel that the gap is relatively large. First, the equipment is old and the facilities feel like it was ten years ago; the second is the complex environment. The first floor and the negative first floor are all shops, which feel like a supermarket; third, the service is also lacking. , The service attitude is acceptable, but there is a gap between the service content and the order promise. In general, Yintai is really old, and the gap with first-tier five-star hotels is a bit big

msg:The service is really satisfactory, the mineral water is sufficient, timely, cleaned twice a day, and the attitude is friendly.
It's a pity that even if the hotel is a super deluxe ocean view room, Ctrip marked 38 square meters, visually about 30 square meters, the room is not large, 38 square meters should be the building area with the balcony, including the wall, the balcony is also very small, barely the widest point 1 Meters, 0.7 meters at the narrowest point.
The advantage is that the bed is 1.35 meters long, which is recommended for families with two couples and two children. The soundproofing is average, and the door opening and closing on the side is noisy at night.
The location is very good. It belongs to the more lively part of the East China Sea. There are McDonald's, Hong Kong-style tea restaurants, and Lawson at the door. The bus to the duty-free shop requires an appoin**ent one day in advance. Go to the airport or duty-free shop to book a car at around 50
The breakfast is a wide variety, but not many delicious, the quality is average. If you are full, the fruit is recommended to be closed. As the hometown of fruit, watermelon, cantaloupe is not sweet. Not as good as some local fruits, such as papaya, mango, pineapple and so on.

The room was clean, there was no peculiar smell, the bedding was comfortable, and the overall feeling was excellent value for money.

msg:The summer vacation is here, so take the kids to Sanya early. Many hotels do not know where to stay to make the demanding self stay comfortable. Looking at the highly rated Dadonghai Yintai Sunshine Hotel, staying in with the mentality of trying, it feels really good. The hotel has convenient transportation, good service attitude and high efficiency. The front desk service is enthusiastic. The breakfast has many varieties and tastes good, and adults and children can choose what they like. In particular, the hotel's service is very considerate. This parent-child tour is mainly to take the children to have fun and live comfortably. In my own twin room, the waiter is willing to help merge the beds so that we can happily squeeze one in the evening with the children. What surprised me the most was that the waiter used one big bed sheet for the next day. The beds are made side by side, and the gaps between the beds are merged so that there is no bump, so that the children sleeping in the middle of the bed will feel like home when they are tired from playing outside during the day. It is really intimate! ! !

The lady at the front desk was very caring and enthusiastic. She immediately checked in for us and raised the room to the seventh floor for free. The view of the sea view was better. On the last night, we took the initiative to upgrade our deluxe sea-view suites. Thank you very much for the arrangement of the staff, so that my wife and I had a pleasant holiday. The hotel staff are very professional and courteous, and any needs can be resolved in time. The hotel environment is also very beautiful, and it is very close to the beach. In the evening, you can take a walk on the beach, blow the sea breeze, and watch the sunset. The hotel‚Äôs breakfast is very rich and the desserts are delicious. The BBD in the evening was also great, and there was also a performance by the resident singer, which made people feel happy. This is a very cost-effective hotel and it is worth staying.

msg:The hotel service is still very good. I took the initiative to join the club and upgraded to a parent-child ocean view room. They called the waiter to change towels and they were also very patient. The room has a balcony and a clothes rack.
The interior decoration condition of the room is still very different from other brands of four-star and five-star. The cabinet door of the room is broken and cannot be moved.
There are many corals and shells on the beaches of the Dadonghai Sea. It hurts to step on barefoot. The child's feet were cut by the coral on the first day, so he didn't swim.
I booked a parent-child activity in the hotel and reported archery, but the waiter mistakenly turned it into swimming, but failed to play.
Let‚Äôs talk about the yacht going out to sea again. The three-story yacht is sent to the bottom floor. We will mobilize and add 150 per person to the two floors upstairs before it starts. In the afternoon, they will all be called to the bottom floor for 20 yuan to open the blind box. It is still very easy to consume. When I disembarked, I couldn't find the car to the hotel, so I left by myself not far from the hotel. The driver called me when I got to the hotel as soon as possible.
In general, the hotel‚Äôs price/performance ratio is good, and it‚Äôs okay for the accommodation environment to be low. It‚Äôs very convenient to eat and shop around.

One is the best location facing the bay, with excellent views through the windows;
The second is that it is very close to the beach, only tens of meters away, and the nearby coastal beach is very long, so you can surf and surf at will;
Third, the bustling business district outside the hotel makes life extremely convenient. In the evening, food stalls and music bars are open two kilometers along the beach, feasting and feasting, tourists are weaving, and the a**osphere is relaxed;
Fourth, the hotel has complete leisure facilities, including a gym, a tea room, and three swimming pools, large, medium and small, for adults and children;
Fifth, it is convenient to get in and out. There are buses and taxis to the airport and everywhere in the city, and there are free shuttle buses to and from the duty-free shopping malls.
Sixth, the service is very good, the room items are tidy and the service is timely.
The disadvantage is that the room is slightly smaller, the configuration of electrical appliances (such as switch sockets and USB ports) needs to be improved, and the indoor soft decoration is slightly simple.
