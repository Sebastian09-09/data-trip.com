How much they want to make money. The mini bar is empty. Are they afraid that the guests will eat and dine? There is no dry and wet separation, and there is not even an extra shower. It is not as good as an ordinary daily rental apar**ent.

msg:First of all, I am very grateful to the front desk because I didn't ask for my name, so there may be no way to name me here.
Thanks for being upgraded to executive status and given double breakfast. Full of experience.
But it is also very regrettable because when I stay in every hotel, there is basically a note to leave a message for our hotel. I also left a note to leave a message. However, our Holiday Inn is the only one that did not call me to give me feedback, so I feel very sorry and still hope to have some communication and communication.

Because we did encounter some problems during the check-in process. If our duty manager could see the note and reply, we might be able to have some cooperation and solutions.

Of course, the overall experience is very NICE, because I will promote it on social media and our hotel is very close to my home. However, I was given a room type without a view, so I didn’t take any good photos. But the Chris**as tree is still beautiful.

The reason why I gave it four stars for cleanliness is because there were blood stains on the bed pillows in my hotel room. I think this should not appear in our five-star hotel. Because I discovered this in the morning and I was about to check out, I didn't pursue it. But my personal feeling is still very bad. I didn't want to write it out because I left a note, but since our hotel partner didn't give me any feedback or even a phone call, I'll just explain it here and hope the relevant people can see it.

There is a large wetland park opposite the hotel, which is a good place to take a walk and stroll.
I had eaten at the buffet before. The meat skewers were very fresh and the salmon tasted good. I heard that there would be imported oysters later. I was looking forward to it. The waiter in the restaurant also asked our opinions and recorded them.
We also offered free parking when checking out👍👍👍👍👍.

The layout of the room is reasonable. Although it is newly decorated, it has no smell. The hardware, linens and toiletries in the room are very good.
The restaurant is located on the first floor of the hotel. I went there at 9:30. There was no one there. It was a very comfortable dining experience. You can also check out and issue invoices at the entrance of the hotel restaurant. This is very friendly for those who are in a hurry.
I checked out near 1pm, and there was no call to urge me during the process. The service was really great. Many hotel employees did not remember their names. I am also very grateful to Sunny and other friends. It was a great experience. I will continue to choose this hotel next time. Home.
Finally, there is New World Paris Spring nearby, which is a business district. I arrived too late and did not have time to experience the surrounding restaurants. I feel that the hotel is in a good location and is worth recommending.

Whether it's the cleanliness or the room service, I can only say that I am very satisfied. Even the seams of the bathtub, which many hotels don't clean, were polished so brightly that I was impressed.
Dennis Zhang at the front desk was also very dedicated in his service. When I had some problems with my Ctrip order and needed to rebook, he actively helped me contact the supervisor. Because we need to wait, I saw that I was carrying a lot of things while I was waiting and took the initiative to guide us to the rest area to finish the process and then call me. Very attentive and worthy of praise!
The only flaw was the reception at breakfast. I was very impressed by a certain lady at the reception. If Dennis at the front desk hadn't given me such a good impression, I would have considered leaving a negative review.

msg:I usually choose hotels under the InterContinental brand, but this time my experience was very bad. 1. I took a taxi to the hotel, but the security guard turned a blind eye and I had to take my luggage out of the car myself. The service advantage of a star-rated hotel was completely lost. 2. The lobby manager was full of lies. The three-day king-size bed I reserved was said to be fully booked today and he would upgrade it. I have a room type for one day, but I need to change it back to the original room type the next day. Please, am I not tired of moving so much luggage? 3. There was no drinking water prepared in the guest room, and I had to call to ask for it myself. The new guy at the front desk was probably shocked, and it took half an hour to deliver the water, which was speechless. I checked out quickly the next day and went to the Sheraton. Although the hotel was older, the service was not even a little bit better than this. I was very disappointed with the InterContinental Hotel this time!

msg:The hotel is extremely irresponsible. I stayed for one day and paid a deposit. When I checked out, I was told that the deposit would be returned the same way. But when I left, I found that the money had been deducted. I contacted the hotel staff and said that this operation error required me to come to the hotel and provide Bank card information and password? ? ? Reluctantly, I went to the hotel at 2 pm on November 26 and communicated with the lobby manager for half an hour. I made a lot of phone calls to find out. He asked me to write down the bank card information, saying that I would not go to work today, and the accountant would refund it when I work tomorrow. He also added the hotel work WeChat account and told him to contact me if I have any questions. I contacted the hotel on WeChat on Monday and said that I didn't know about it. They had changed people and I didn't know.
How can there be such a scam hotel? It arbitrarily deducts customers' deposits without repaying them or acknowledging the accounts. Every time someone pays back, they have to communicate repeatedly and delay as long as they can. Every waiter is very lazy and does not want to take responsibility.
I will never book this hotel again next time, it’s really rubbish

msg:The hygiene and environment are very good. The bad service review came on the first day when I checked in because the computer at the front desk was stuck during check-in and the male waiter actually said a curse word to the computer in front of the guests (the quality of such a high-end hotel employee should not be like this). The bad reviews for the facilities are that the hot water for bathing is alternately hot and cold, and when it is cold it makes me shiver, and when it is hot it is so hot that it burns me, making it impossible to take a shower (this situation has happened to me after staying in hotels for more than ten years) ). I applied for a room change and the result was still the same, so forget it. We rented two rooms in total and asked my relatives if their rooms would be like this. Since they used the bathtub to soak in water, they didn’t notice if it was the same~ We checked in the next day.

msg:Elong is already at the highest level. I gradually started using Ctrip to maintain my account. This time I booked four nights with Ctrip. Let me tell you about the overall experience!
The front desk staff is very frustrated. A group of interns can't understand anything. If they don't understand, they call and harass them in the middle of the night! The guy in the picture above and the guy who worked the night before, whose name I don’t know, are the worst... I’ll also call the hotel lobby manager to report the specific situation!
The service staff in the guest room talked unscrupulously in the corridor, and opened and closed the door unscrupulously.
(The service staff in the restaurant give the hotel extra points) Especially Peter is very OK👍
At present, many of them are not perfect. The swimming pool is not open and the gym is half-empty.
I hope the hotel can manage and improve the above in the future, otherwise it will be a disgrace to the name of Intercontinental.

msg:My stay in this hotel really improved my understanding of basic hotel services. On the first day I checked in, the bathroom curtain in the room was not installed. I just threw the bathroom curtain into the sink. I was checked in directly without any acceptance. I didn’t throw away the takeaways that were placed in the storage room for three days. After staying in the room, the room card didn’t work for a whole day. The elevator was even scarier. After entering, I pressed the floor button and the elevator didn’t move at all. The door will open automatically, and the floor button that is pressed is always on. The facilities and procedures of the entire hotel are in chaos. To be honest, if they hadn't been patient and listened to my complaints, I would have called the Market Supervision Bureau directly. I made a consumer complaint and the experience at the end of check-out was very poor. For customers who had this kind of experience after several days, they did not even give an apology when they checked out. Before that, I asked your so-called manager to give a reply. Where did it go? ! ! !

講一點不足：衹有手持花灑，水量一般水温有小波動；睡覺輕習慣耳塞酒店這邊遺憾未備，而美居甚至有漱口水；入住當天下午辦入住前台靚女偏冷淡，謝謝你讓我不忘春寒料峭，可能是我們誤入她的IHG高級會員desk的原因。

總結：兩晚用券兑換下次開車來浦東其實可能還是會入住，但如果價格更高我會更多權衡
