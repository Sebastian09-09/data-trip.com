msg:I recently had the opportunity to stay at the Qihu Hotel, and the experience was excellent. I was impressed by the service and facilities of this hotel.
The location of the Qihu Hotel is very advantageous, located on the scenic Yanqi Lake, with a quiet and pleasant environment.
The accommodation facilities of the Qihu Hotel are very complete and luxurious. The room I stayed in was spacious and bright, elegantly decorated, and the lake view was panoramic, which made me feel at home. The room was fully equipped and the bedding was comfortable, allowing me to have a good sleep experience. Whether it was the cleaning and tidying of the room or the supply of breakfast, the hotel also provided a wealth of entertainment facilities, such as an indoor heated swimming pool and a children's playground, so that my family and I could spend a good time.
Overall, the stay experience at the Qihu Hotel was great. Whether it was from the environment, facilities, services or catering, I was very satisfied. I highly recommend it to friends who are looking for a high-quality accommodation experience.

msg:Environment: The room and environment are nice. It is right by the Yanqi Lake. There are passages and doors leading directly to the scenic area, and you can also go to the plank road by the lake. It is very pleasant to walk by the lake, and you can see the sunset on the opposite bank after dinner.
Service:
1. We were supposed to check in at 3 o'clock. We arrived at the hotel at 4 o'clock in the afternoon, but the room was not ready. It was not ready until after 5 o'clock. We were asked to rest in the lounge next to it, and bottled water, carbonated drinks and snacks were provided.
2. I called the front desk at more than 7 o'clock in the evening to send another quilt. After urging 4 times, it was not delivered until 10:30.
Facilities: It is not a parent-child hotel. The facilities are not very friendly to children. There is no low sink, no small toilet and no children's toilet seat. The children's play area is divided into indoor and outdoor areas, both of which are relatively small.
Dining: The buffet dinner is very average, and the breakfast is a little better, which is about the level of an ordinary 3-4 star hotel.

msg:The room is in an excellent location, but it's a bit of a detour from the lobby. The room service is satisfactory. The only bad thing is the dinner buffet. I didn't choose the set meal with dinner. When I went to the door, the waiter persuaded me to leave, saying that I couldn't accept people without a set meal. It was ridiculous. Later, a supervisor came over and said that I could go and see the dishes, 268 yuan to see if it was suitable. Was he worried that the room package would not meet the usual 268 standard? This is ridiculous. Such a big hotel benchmarked as a five-star hotel can't even have a smooth buffet dinner. Or was it to recommend going to the Chinese restaurant? 15% service fee, the service fee for two meals was more than 300 yuan.

msg:[Service] Must get full marks: The two lobby managers who received me were very enthusiastic and actively helped me find a room with a good view for my patient. Especially Zhang Juan, who works in the afternoon shift, took the trouble to show me two rooms with different views. Lake view rooms (one of them is very far away, it takes a long time to walk). When I came back, I checked on the computer one by one which room was better. Even I said that this is it, just this one.
[Environment] The scenery outside the lobby bar is beautiful. On a cloudy and rainy day, the green mountains are shrouded in mist, and the reflection in the lake is like an ink painting. It seems that if you want to sit down and enjoy it indoors, you have to pay. I went to the outdoor area from the side door and stayed for a while. There are also sofa seats. I don’t know if I need to pay to sit. At least I sat there for a while and no one said anything.
[Room] The lake view balcony room booked is on the second floor. You can see the lake view while lying on the bed, but it is blocked by trees. It is next to the cruise ship pier and you can see the speedboat moored by the lake.
The hotel and rooms are very new and have a sense of design. The oversized balcony, smart toilet, variable frosted glass partitions, and electric curtains all left a deep impression on me.
[Meal] I only had one dinner at a Chinese restaurant. The chicken soup with luffa was amazing. The Western-style soup base like cream of mushroom soup with luffa was plain and tasty. The seafood pimple soup cost 68 for a large pot. I would eat this alone. I drank six small bowls. The breakfast buffet is also very rich, with both Chinese and Western options. There is actually smoked salmon for breakfast, which is also served with capers and lemons, which is quite good. Seeing that I was pushing a wheelchair, the supervisor thoughtfully brought me coffee (the coffee machine was far away from the seat), and the waiter helped bring hot milk, which made me feel embarrassed.
I will go there again, for the dish and to stay in a lake view room facing the lake and mountains to experience the beautiful scenery.

msg:Hotel Black Gold VIP

The hotel is in a good location, next to Yanqi Lake. The lake view room can see the lake from the room. It is very new, but
1. The hotel room settings are very confusing and complicated. In the park, every place with the four big words "hotel entrance" written on it cannot be entered by swiping the room card. All guests can only climb a very steep three-story staircase and walk around a long circle to the only door in the atrium that can be swiped open. There is no hotel entrance written on it. 👍 Whether you are with a child or pushing a stroller, the waiter will not come to help you open the door to let you in.
2. Chinese restaurant: The taste is very good, but the average serving time is 1 hour
3. Buffet restaurant: I am sorry for the price of 300 per person. Compared with other five-star hotels, the choice is at least half less
4. Management chaos: Two rooms, one for two days and one for one day. In order to avoid misunderstandings, the front desk phone was called from the check-out room at the time of check-out, and they were informed that the call for the two rooms was called, and the other room was for the child and the elderly to take a nap. Then within half an hour, they kept calling the other room to stay in. After failing, they pushed the cleaning cart to open the door and go in to clean. 👍At the same time, the registered mobile phone received a call from the front desk, and both rooms were checked out. 👍 I booked for two days, but they only charged me and didn't let me stay. 👍 
5. The so-called lake view room may be a tree view room

msg:The surrounding environment of this hotel is very good. You can climb hills from the hotel's path, and there are also places for children to play outdoors. New hotel, very clean and hygienic.
There are also areas for improvement:
1. It was too late to check in. It is recommended to find more people to clean the house during holidays and weekends, and to have more people at the front desk.
2. The lobby bar has a beautiful scenery, and you can sit there for consumption, but it has to be surrounded by a fence, which feels a bit petty.
3. It is best to use the door card to open the boardwalk by Wangwang Lake. If you want to climb a mountain in the morning, the door will not open.
4. There are too few types of breakfast. The taste of the Chinese restaurant is okay, but the price is too high.

msg:Yan also figured out some details this time. Yanqi Lake Park and the surrounding hotels are not managed in a unified manner. Unlike most scenic spots, you need to buy an extra ticket to go to the park. I went to the store and heard that a trail around the lake was opened. You can make an appoin**ent with the Holiday Ambassador. You can go to the trail around the lake from 9-10 am, and there are boat rides, etc. I contacted the Holiday Ambassador that night. The next day, I found that the room card could not open the door. I contacted the Ambassador by phone. The Ambassador coordinated with the security to open the door. As soon as I went down, I was stopped by the park security, saying that hotel guests were not allowed to come to the park from here. The Ambassador communicated and said that it had been agreed that today was the first day of business. The security said that they needed to ask for instructions. Walk into the park on the left Park, it is said that you can climb the mountain if you walk to the right. We walked to the right and took the plank road. When we reached the foot of the mountain, the big iron gate was locked. They said that climbing is not allowed now. It will be open at least until next month. We are not sure. We returned. We were still not allowed to enter the park gate. There was no ticket service. In short, it took an hour to walk around the lake for dozens of meters. We gave up, checked out of the hotel and reported the situation to the front desk. The attitude was very indifferent. No one in the entire hotel gave any explanation for this situation. Ctrip gave negative feedback on it. Ctrip followed up and said that they would contact the hotel to apologize, but the hotel did not contact them. It is not clear what the situation is at present. In addition, objective evaluation The waiter at the breakfast restaurant was very enthusiastic, the waiter who led me on the first day of check-in was also very enthusiastic, and the lady at the entrance of the swimming hall was also very good

msg:1. The hotel is only suitable for people who drive themselves. If you don't have a car, don't go there. It's very inconvenient;
2. The dinner for two written in the reservation is a reduced version of the dinner for two (no buffet) - the combination is very simple, but the taste is good;
3. The official website has a promotion for room upgrades in March, but in fact, only those days can be upgraded. It is not clear, which greatly affects the check-in experience;
4. The hotel has a passage to the scenic spot, but it is not open! It is very troublesome to go to the scenic spot. After a circle, the front desk can't explain the situation clearly, and they are very impatient. So if you want to stay in a hotel and go to the scenic spot, you should pay attention. You can choose Yanqi Hotel (I personally recommend this scenic afternoon tea).
5. The sewer smell in the guest room is very strong. Be sure to pay attention when you check in. They will only repair it. Even if there is a problem with the opened room, it will not be replaced, so be sure to check it as soon as you check in;
6. All the mini bars in the guest room are not free. The price list is very hidden in another place. Pay special attention;
7. The room is comfortable. The linens are very comfortable. Overall, there are pros and cons. It is suitable for people with money. If you want to enjoy a good experience, you can choose Yanqi Hotel.

The service is very good. The service staff in the lobby and restaurant are friendly and enthusiastic, and are very friendly to children. However, when we had lunch, the floor of the Chinese restaurant was not very clean. After the guests at the previous table left, the underside of the table was not cleaned.
The food is OK. Will go next time.
Our lake view room was of average value for money, far away from the lake and blocked by big trees. Since there are not many guests, we should arrange better rooms

What should I do if I have a second or third child? Very bad experience! 4. The room will provide you with flip-flops for adults...Do you have a beach here? And it's winter! 5. The front desk is chasing your child and wants him to do facial recognition? Only 4 years old! Are you unhappy when you hear that you are going to sleep? 6. The food in the restaurant is expensive! It's suitable for business banquets, but not for families. I don't know what to think, and the menu is not complete! 7. The various signs are unclear. There is no sign on the location of toilet paper towels, and no sign on the elevator entrance! 8. There are chili peppers in the eggs for hotel breakfast tea... Well, children can eat whatever eggs they want, there is no other choice...

In summary, if you live here, just wait for half a year! It smells too much!

msg:The lake view room is on the edge of Yanqi Lake. The view is very nice. The hotel has a small path along the lake, but it is too short. You can see Yanqi Lake Park below on the path by the lake, but you can't go down. If you want to go to Yanqi Lake, you have to go around the hotel and enter from the main entrance of the park. It would be great if the hotel guests had an exclusive passage to enter Yanqi Lake directly from the hotel.
Needless to say, the facilities in the new hotel rooms are very new. I had breakfast, lunch and dinner in the hotel. The buffet for dinner was slightly inferior and had few varieties. The set meal I had in the Chinese restaurant at noon was very good even though it was home-cooked. The service staff could also adjust the set meal content slightly according to the actual situation, which was very flexible.
The hotel guards Yanqi Lake, and should develop more content for Yanqi Lake tours, which will be more attractive.

I booked a lake view room with a balcony. The door was locked and I wasn’t sure if it could be opened, but it was very cold in the winter and we didn’t plan to go out. Directly facing the outside is the scenery of Yanqi Lake, which is beautiful both during the day and at night. It is originally a place to relax on weekends. In winter, you can stay in the hotel and take beautiful photos without going out.
The room we booked included dinner and breakfast buffet. The dishes were good, and it was very convenient to be in the hotel. The meal service time was also relatively long, and it was very free.
Finally, in terms of service, there is not much to say~ The staff were very enthusiastic. After checking in, they helped us deliver all our luggage to the room and gave us a brief introduction.
I decided to take my best friend here to celebrate her birthday on the weekend, so I called the hotel in advance and asked if they could bring some balloons or something to decorate. The hotel said it was no problem, as long as it didn't damage the wall.

All in all, it was a very comfortable and pleasant stay~ I saw a small performance when I passed by the lobby in the afternoon. There were many children playing together. The a**osphere was very good. Come and experience it while it has just opened. qwq

msg:因為是新酒店，所以還在磨合期，在排房方面還不成熟導致一開始和我備註需求沒有匹配上，但是必須説，在前廳一位女負責人的積極協調下，房間問題最終解決得非常好，讓我看到了酒店服務上的誠意。而且每位服務人員都很積極熱情，這個點還是挺重要的。自助餐廳餐飲中規中矩品種不多，但是，品質還是考究的，因為趕上假期外加酒店做活動，人非常多，所以服務人員也很多，根據制服類別能看出是多部門多層級都參與進來了，有的人天生有眼力見注重細節，有的人一直奔走卻未切中服務的重點，哈哈，天資不同不予置評，不過規範性培訓還真的非常重要，不然糾紛投訴多得就會讓管理層疲於滅火而無暇提升品質。中餐廳菜品質量非常高，口味好，這點出乎意料，哈哈哈。湖景房視野真的贊。這次旅行有個特別意外且大的收穫，就是賓客中心的Mia張金秀，服務周到貼心自然，感覺就像相識許久的朋友，留心每一處細節，因為我訂的是房包餐，會在早餐後貼心幫助預訂晚餐廳景觀位，對周邊遊玩也積極參與了建設性意見，在我們一家六口有各種這樣那樣的需求時都能第一時間積極滿足，親切熱情卻不失邊界，友好禮貌卻不失温度，真的非常贊👍酒店豪華滿足的是居住硬件，貼心服務滿足的就是住客心情舒暢，服務業最重要的就是提供服務的人，人好必然事半功倍。非常滿意這次西湖飯店之行！

在酒店前台辦理入住完，康樂部黃亮很熱情幫我送至房間，途中介紹整個酒店業態以及假日大使活動，房間朝湖，風景優美，陽台的窗户打不開，聯繫了前台安排人幫我們打開的，房間温度也適宜。後面去了健身房泳池也是黃亮接待的，還體驗了觀光電動車，欣賞了環湖風景，他告訴我們假日大使在酒店無處不在，在其他酒店確實很難得有這種無微不至的服務，另外誇一下小童城的工作人員李祥，今天退房後是他送我去停車場的，他們這個橙色棒球服很吸引眼球，團隊也是這個酒店的亮點，這兩天住的很不錯，過段時間還會再帶朋友來住，管理團隊很優秀！

  早餐豐富。
  服務規範。前台小夥辦理入住很快。工作耐心細緻。向我們詳細介紹灑店的基本情況。
  灑店位置極佳，座落在雁棲湖畔，與大貝殼隔湖相望，由其到了晚上，光彩奪目。

酒店服務：作為和高星價格對標的酒店，地理位置，酒店硬件這麼好，不能讓服務折了酒店品質。到達酒店後，並未見到禮賓人員，可能到的過早？（13點），酒店前台辦理入住就是走個流程，對早餐在哪，酒店有什麼活動也沒有過多介紹。可能因為入住率不高，基本把人員都安排在3層（酒店首層）。1400的園景房並不便宜，打開窗户是一面牆這你受的了麼。況且還是在入住率不高的情況下，所以我們要求換了樓層。辦完入住帶我們去房間的人員還是不錯的，很負責，介紹了小童活動預約怎麼操作。關於酒店的小童活動，也是比較簡單，既然想走clubmed託管式服務路線，我覺得活動這部分有待加強。中餐廳的服務非常好，但是自助早餐衹有2個服務員，明顯沒有跟上自助餐的節奏，咖啡需要自己打，座位也需要自己找。

缺點：陽台門不能鎖，殘疾人電梯無需刷卡，開車入住無人核查，有安全隱患。作為剛開業的酒店，樓體周圍/天台以及室內陽台不少灰塵泥土，房間洗手枱下水已有堵塞跡象，樓道地毯不少地方已經起球，泳池似乎還對外開放，客流大的時段無人維護清理。

泳池的温度非常贊，小童泳池也特別適合小朋友，我們4點多來泳池，正好在泳池看完落日，太太愜意～

更讓我驚喜的是，棲湖飯店的游泳池。水質清澈，非常適合游泳鍛鍊。此外，飯店還提供了舒適的休閑區域，讓我在游泳後可以在這裏休息，享受美好的陽光時光。
