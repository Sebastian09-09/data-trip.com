I returned for the 2023 Spring Festival, and it was even better because the beach had been renovated. This trip was very relaxing and enjoyable. I would return to Haikou Shangri-La because the staff and other guests were friendly and helpful.

The room is clean, spacious, and I paid to upgrade to an ocean room view which was worth the price. Breakfast is good with a good mix of western and eastern foods. The location is a bit inconvenient, it‚Äôs still in a developing area so there‚Äôs not much around. Old street and other attractions and decent restaurants were about 30 mins away.

Staff were excellent in accomodating us and gave us an upgrade. The buffet breakfast and buffet dinner are excellent value and of high quality. The pool is fantastic to relax and the gym is also quite good. There is not much close to the hotel but if you are happy to stay in the hotel it will not be a problem! Our cleaner, Wu Xiang, kept the room immaculate and helped us greatly! Would highly recommend staying at this hotel for a great value 5 star experience!

msg:One day in advance, Miss Li from the Royal Service Center of the hotel called in advance to understand our check-in requirements. Because our children are small, bed guards, wash stools, children's toiletries, children's slippers, etc. were prepared in advance in our room, which was very considerate. We were guided throughout the process on how to use duty-free coupons, bus times, etc. The hotel breakfast environment is good and the food is delicious. The swimming pool, children's playground, and hot springs are actually supported by guests staying in the hotel. The Ctrip package is a bit of a scam, but the travel photography is unexpectedly good. The photographer Mr. Liu has a good level of snapshots. An activity that was not expected at first, but it turned out to take a lot of good photos. For the first time, we stayed for one night. The waiter at the front desk was very good and gave us a discount price of 618. We ate in the hotel Chinese restaurant for four consecutive days, and the service was also very good and the dishes were exquisite. The waiter Sherry who checked out was very considerate to send an imported bath set and listened carefully to our suggestions. I feel very satisfied with this vacationüëç

I originally planned to stay for two nights, but later I added two more nights. The outdoor swimming pool and the indoor swimming pool are very beautiful and hygienic. The water temperature of the outdoor swimming pool is comfortable. The children especially like it. We swim twice a day and don't get tired of it. It is very close to the duty-free shop and Yuanda Shopping Center. It is very convenient to call a Didi car. The fruits and drinks delivered are very good. I really give a good evaluation. I will definitely stay here next time. Before staying, I read the reviews of the hotel, which reported that it was damp and musty. I personally speak the truth. You chose to stay at the beach and chose a sea view room. Don't open the balcony door. How can you have this feeling? It rained almost every day during the few days we stayed. It is also at the beach, so humidity is unavoidable. This is my fair evaluation of this hotel. Anyway, if I have the chance next time, I will still stay here

msg:After moving here from Sanya, everyone agreed that this hotel is much better. First of all, it is not crowded and very quiet. Although it has been open for a long time, it is well maintained. The air conditioning in the room is very strong. I almost died of heat in Yalong Bay. The only drawback is that there is no exhaust fan in the bathroom, and the sewer in the shower room has a bit of a bad smell. The hotel staff are very friendly, especially Xiao Meng at the front desk and a handsome guy in the buffet restaurant. They are very enthusiastic. The hotel scenery is also very good, and the swimming pool is not small. Across the swimming pool and across the road is the beach, where you can watch the sunset. It is really a treasure hotel and highly recommended.

msg:Facilities: The early luxurious decoration does not hinder the use at all. It is a**ospheric and comfortable, quiet and suitable. The hotel has sufficient air conditioning and the bed is large and comfortable. The toiletries are very useful, especially the shower gel, which smells particularly good with citrus. Both the water park and the hot spring are available.

Hygiene: There is nothing unsatisfactory.

Environment: I don‚Äôt know the background of the hotel, but I can see that they are willing to spend money to operate it. Because I stayed overnight and flew the next day, I didn‚Äôt go around much. I looked down from the upstairs and saw people coming and going in the water park and the hot spring. The room type was upgraded, and the view is open when the window is opened.

Service: The first round of drinks is free, the check-in fruit is delicious, and the front desk lady is very enthusiastic. Because it is checked in at night, there is also a night bed service (the previous hotel was free), which is very considerate. The next day, I took the children to the children's park, and the little brother accompanied them for an hour throughout the whole process. This is also the first time I have encountered it. After checking out, the children‚Äôs toys were left behind, and the hotel called before I found it. I felt the warmth again.

In summary, I booked this Haikou State Guesthouse casually for one night, but I didn't expect an unexpected surprise. I'm actively commenting to recommend it to friends who are about to go there. The hotel is very comfortable and suitable for families. Don't be brainwashed by marketing hype. The Weiss I stayed at in Lingshui before was a big pit. I was sweating all over the hotel, and the most basic temperature control was not done well. Alas~

As soon as I opened the door, I was amazed by the view of the sea view room. I could see the hot spring pool garden up close and the beach trail in the distance. The garden is suitable for little fairies to pose and take photos. The indoor swimming pool is an independent stage for swimming enthusiasts. Sister Yang from the service center tracked the service throughout the whole process. She recorded and coordinated the needs in advance. You must click the thumbs up manually. The welcome fruit is full of sincerity. You can't finish it if you can't eat it. It's a 5-minute walk to the beach. You can get up early to catch the sea sand. The hotel is located in the new district. There are not many shops next to it. If you don't eat in the hotel, you can choose to drive 8 minutes to reach the nearby large community to solve the problem of eating, drinking and having fun.

There is a bubble show in the children's pool at 5 o'clock, and the buffet has discounts which are more cost-effective. The indoor swimming pool is okay, and there is a locker room. There are also massage pools and saunas. The shortcomings are that the hotel rooms are small, the facilities are old, and there are not many parent-child elements. There is no indoor playground and only a small handicraft classroom. There was a thunderstorm on the 2nd and there are no other indoor places to play. The outdoor children's swimming pool is very small. It's small. There are two hot spring pools out of three, each one is about 5 square meters. I'm not used to the lack of butler service in a hotel.

The room type was upgraded for free for us, and we were called in advance to ask if we needed toiletries for the children. The hotel could lend us sand digging tools for free, and the children's playground was also very beautiful. The breakfast was delicious, as was the dregs and vinegar in the evening. I told the waiter about the cleaning and it was done quickly. The hot springs are great, but there are not many pools. The only minor drawbacks are that it takes a few minutes to walk from the hotel to the beach and you have to cross the road, and there are mosquitoes in the children's playground.

msg:Very nice, the hotel has a tropical swimming pool and hot spring. The beach is just across the road, but the sand and seawater are average.
If the purpose of the trip is to rest in the hotel, this place is really great. But it is quite far from the city, and it is not recommended if you want to go to the city without renting a car.

Welcome drinks on the first day: Coke, Sprite and two kinds of juice

Welcome fruit once during the stay: it is recommended to change to oranges without seeds

Facilities: It can be seen that it is not very new, but the overall hygiene is very good, and the a**osphere is very comfortable

msg:Self-driving in Hainan for 4 days, the first day was at the Boao State Guesthouse, and the second day at the Lingshui Hilton. We have not been to Haikou for more than 20 years and had no hope. As a result, I was shocked as soon as I entered the door. I have to say that the decoration of Shangri-La Hotel is really good! The reception quality at the front desk is comparable to that of Hangzhou West Lake State Guesthouse! What I particularly like is, first, the response speed is super fast. It is almost 12 o'clock in the evening, we will not turn off a light, and the call is answered in seconds. In less than 1 minute after the call, the waiter has arrived and taught us immediately. Second, it‚Äôs not uncommon for hotels to give away fruits, but the ones they give are delicious and of high quality. At the end of last year, the newly opened five-star hotel in France where I stayed would give away spoiled fruit, which tasted terrible. Third, the hot spring water is super good. My skin was obviously lubricated after soaking in it. Later I found out that it was real volcanic water. Fourth, it takes time for a tree to grow. No comparison does no harm. Compared with the newly opened five-star hotels in Sanya, the garden of Haikou State Guesthouse is more forest-like, super comfortable and beautiful. 5. You can lie down casually while camping, and it only takes 3 minutes to walk to the beach. It is worth mentioning that you can see a natural fishing boat haven, which is quite interesting.

Ten minutes after arriving in the room, the manager on duty called to ask how the room was. In this way, if there is anything you don‚Äôt like, if not, please change the room for us... Like it! When we were almost done with breakfast, a cart brought us exquisite chocolate desserts, and a cart brought seafood porridge and asked us if we wanted it. We said no because we were almost done, but we didn‚Äôt expect the enthusiasm. The little brother said: It's very good, you can try a little less...it's so good, so enthusiastic, and sincere! I used to stay at Wan H near Haikou, but the service couldn't compare with the State Guesthouse. To be honest, this hotel has too many advantages, the swimming pool is so beautiful, and the lobby is so domineering!

msg:The hotel is relatively close to the Haikou International Duty Free Shop, and there are also some shopping malls and places to eat around. It is relatively close to the port where cars enter the island, so nearby roads are often controlled.
The room facilities are a bit older, and the weather was bad when we went there, but I can imagine that when the weather is good, the garden and sea views will be beautiful, which is also the biggest advantage. In addition, there are three small pools and hot springs outside. The bed in the room was very small, especially the twin beds in the deluxe sea view room that we got in the first place. The twin beds were one meter apart, and the distance between them was very small. The room was also small. Then we changed to a room with one meter and two beds, but the balcony was solid. It's made of glass and the view is not good. There is a loud sound when the door is closed, and the sound insulation is very poor. You can hear the door slamming all day long. Also, there was no toothbrush inside the toothbrush when the toothbrush was opened, and the water in the shower was clogged once (I cleaned it myself). . . The details are not very good. The service was okay, and so was the breakfast, but the replenishment was not very timely. The overall feeling is average, but the bed is relatively small and the sound insulation is poor. I am not very satisfied. I forgot about a T-shirt, so I called the front desk specifically, which was great.
In addition, the water in the room feels like it could be changed, at least from Nongfu Spring? The welcome fruits can also be enriched.

I stayed there for three days before going to Sanya and when I came back from Sanya. There is no difference at all.

It's very comfortable to lie down by the pool, and there are few people on the beach opposite, so it's nice to walk around.
Praise for breakfast üëç, the Chinese and Western food are clearly divided, the circulation design is reasonable, and the variety is quite rich.
It's also convenient to eat around. Hainan Courtyard opposite is nice, 100 meters walk.
This hotel is suitable for vacations, bringing children and the elderly, checking in to one attraction every day, and spending the rest of the time in the hotel. Didi is very convenient and can go anywhere faster, which is better than self-driving.
The room has a bit of French style, which is nice.

Because it was complimentary Chinese food in the room reservation package, I had to make a reservation one day in advance. However, despite the reservation time, the food was still extremely slow. I had to wait for nearly half an hour. During this period, the waiter did not even give me a glass of water.

There are welcome fruits and drinks upon check-in, which are both good. The room was cleaned in a timely manner.

msg:One thing to say, the environment of this hotel is okay all day long, it has been renovated. The garden pool is beautiful. However, everyone who is traveling (not on business) should choose Guozitou Hotel carefully. The beach is a stone beach. There is still a certain gap between the service and a real five-star hotel. There were a lot of people staying during the exhibition, so the hotel's buffet restaurant was closed. Everyone went to eat Chinese food, but the service couldn't keep up. The food was served very slowly and many dishes were missing. The management is really bad. On the first day, I was woken up in the middle of the night by a low and high-frequency sound, and I couldn't fall asleep for a long time. I thought it was someone snoring next door, but the sound happened again the next night as soon as the balcony door was closed. The waiter called out and said it was the sound of the outdoor air conditioner main unit. He couldn't solve it. He said he wanted to get me earplugs, but he called the front desk for half a day. They said they were out of earplugs and there was no room available to change them. After one o'clock, I couldn't sleep and called the waiter to ask if the air conditioner could be turned down. He said no, the main units of all rooms are integrated. At this time, he asked me if I wanted to change rooms. No one from the hotel apologized before checking out the next day. When checking out, they said they would give me a sample set of shampoo. I haven't had a good night's sleep in such an expensive room, so why should I just give a set of this thing to perfunctory customers?
I won‚Äôt stay here again whether it‚Äôs business or tourism next time.

msg:It is really a very cost-effective hotel. When I came here for a meeting, I stayed at the State Guesthouse and the meeting was at the Real Madrid Yehai Hotel. The difference was only 100 yuan a night. The experience was completely different. This place is worthy of being the original Shangri-La in Haikou, with beautiful environment, bright lobby, rooms facing the sea, nice staff, and rich breakfast. It's really great. Fairmont will be listed soon.
My son likes it here very much. Even in the windy days these two days, he still had fun playing in the room. I would like to thank the front desk staff for helping me upgrade to a sea view room, seeing that I brought an elderly person and a child with me. It has a 180-degree sea view. Facing the sea, the mood of spring blossoms is so beautiful.
Evaluate Ctrip's packages: 1. The price is really favorable, especially the room rate including breakfast, because it costs 120 per person to buy breakfast in the store.
2. Welcome drink on the first day: It is actually a free mini bar, which contains two bottles of juice, a bottle of Sprite, and a bottle of Coke. It‚Äôs not worth 138 yuan as Ctrip said.
3. Welcome fruit once during your stay: it‚Äôs not the 168 value Ctrip said, just one banana, two oranges, and one apple.
4 fun parent-child activities: The indoor children's playground is relatively small. When I went there, there was only a 4 and a half year old girl, who happened to be playing with my son, and she was very happy.
5. Ctrip said that the hot springs worth 135 yuan each are actually free, just wear a swimsuit and go directly. There are three outdoor hot spring pools, each about less than 10 square meters, two of which are under maintenance

In fact, the price was not low for an old hotel that opened in 12 years. Originally, I just wanted to find a cleaner hotel for one night, but it turned out that I couldn't make do with this. The hotel bedside table was infested with ants, and there were more than one or two. The room is indeed quite old and the smell of cigarette smoke is very strong. After discovering ants at night, the hotel emphasized that just disinfect them. I emphasized that I was pregnant and had a child with me, but I still said that sterilization would have no impact. Finally, I asked to change rooms, and the hotel agreed, but the wait lasted for more than half an hour. We just took our bags and waited at the door of the new room. During this period, my friend who was traveling with me made two phone calls to the front desk. After moving to the new room, the smell of smoke in the room was also very strong. The experience is really bad
Also, the design of this hotel is unreasonable and the elevator is too far away. The hotel rooms are arranged in an arc shape. There are two elevators in one location. All rooms have to go up and down in the same elevator. There was a long walk to our room, almost a full circle around the hotel.

Quite satisfied, it only takes 9 minutes to walk. As soon as you arrive at the hotel gate, a bellman comes to pick up your luggage. All hotel employees will greet you politely when they see you. The room is clean and tidy, the toiletries have a light fragrance, the bath water is large and comfortable, the balcony looks out to the endless sea, the hotel's outdoor swimming pool is surrounded by green and flowers, the buffet breakfast is rich and delicious, the barista is a shy little brother, The hazelnut latte he makes is both beautiful and fragrant.

It takes less than half an hour to walk to the nearby business district. It only takes ten minutes to go to the beach from the hotel every day. Within minutes, the blue water and soft sandy beach are really beautiful.

The hotel staff was very considerate and enthusiastic. They upgraded me to a sea view room for free, and also provided me with many duty-free shop discounts and photo appoin**ent services (unfortunately, I didn't have time to arrange this this time). They also gave me a set of L'Occitane shampoo and conditioner samples when I left the hotel. The room is quiet and elegant, and the design is very warm. I will definitely stay here again next time I come!

Special thanks also to Sherry, the service is very considerate, thumbs up!

(I wonder if I can make a wish for a future airport pick-up service qwq)

If necessary next time, I will stay in this hotel again

Later, the foreman said that they could only do public cleaning at night, otherwise they would not have time to do it. Originally this was a hotel management issue, and it shouldn't disturb guests' sleep. Unfortunately, I had a flight at 7:20 the next morning and had to get up at around 4 o'clock to catch the flight. After negotiation they stopped cleaning. But I only slept less than 2 hours a night. I checked out in the lobby at 4:30 in the morning. As an apology, the lobby manager prepared breakfast and gifts for me. I was embarrassed. To save their face, I took breakfast and the gift was rejected by me. But how can I eat without sleeping well? I would like to reiterate here that I hope improvements can be made. In residential areas, families and communities, construction work is not allowed to take place at night or on rest days, let alone a star-rated hotel.

I stayed in Hilton for two days and Shangri-La for two days. The decoration of Shangri-La is a bit old. Can you consider replacing a batch of bath towels? It can be seen that it has been used for a long time, but it is better than the scenery of the hotel.
To be honest, the dishes of Shang Palace are also very average. For example, the squirrel mandarin fish can be selected and cooked, but the seasoning is not good, and the sweet and sour marinade is too bad. The problem lies in the tomato sauce. But the service is very good and the response is relatively fast.

But the soundproofing of the room is not very good, I can always hear the movement of the corridor and the crying of the child, which is also very strange to me.
2. The doorman is very enthusiastic, helping to take the bag and delivering the room is OK
3. The types of breakfast are also Ouke, which is relatively rich. The waiters are a bit busy and don't know what they are doing, and their service awareness is not strong.

Next, I want to focus on the following two points. The experience is extremely poor.
1. The front desk staff who check in mainly don‚Äôt know how to look at people positively. My face with a big sunburned face does not look very rich, but it should not look like a beggar, because I checked in with my husband separately. The first time I was like the indifferent machine that won the lottery, the second time I did it for my husband, but it seemed that we were robbing someone else's room, and asked me directly if I did it. The whole process of interrogation mode, this is taking What is the courtesy of a guest? Where does the sense of superiority come from? Is it the Peugeot she wears on her left chest?
2. When I booked this hotel, I was mainly interested in the hot spring swimming pool of the hotel. I was very happy and wanted to take a dip at 10:00 the next day, and then I saw pool after pool of sewage. It took about half an hour after the front desk responded. He told us that it has been dealt with, but it seems that he just adjusted the water temperature. I want to ask the hotel staff to soak in the hot spring water in the pool?
Even when I asked whether it was open or not, I was ambiguous.
I didn't expect such a well-known brand hotel to have such poor service facilities and service quality
It doesn't matter if other people want to live or not. I don't know how to live in a house, and I won't let my family and friends go out. Why bother to spend money and suffer?

In addition, there were ants in the room where my friend stayed... I am really disappointed. I will definitely not choose this hotel again when I come to Haikou next time. Choose carefully.

msg:It was the first time I stayed in Shangri-La, and I lived up to my expectations. It really is the quality and service of an old five-star hotel. Three adults and children booked two double rooms, all of which were upgraded to sea view rooms, basically next to each other. Let me talk about the advantages first: First, the room faces the sea, the scenery is beautiful, the garden pool is covered by green trees, and the stars are dotted at night, which is very beautiful. The second is that the hotel is just across the road from the sea. The beach is very clean. There are beach motorcycles and yachts for rent. Children like to dig sand in the evening. The third is that the hotel gave free travel photography, which was good, and gave five negatives for free, and we bought some extra negatives. Fourth, the quality of service is good. The concierge at the front desk of the concierge is smiling and well-trained. There are two fly in the oin**ent, one is that the west coast is far away from the main city. If you go to the city, it will take a long time. You can only go to Wuyuanhe Plaza and Yuanda Shopping Center to eat nearby, and there are only a few options. The second is that cleaning is relatively slow. On the first day, the child came back to sleep at noon and found that it hadn't been cleaned. After talking to the waiter, it was changed, and two fruits were given as a gift, full of sincerity. PS, it happened to be my ID card's birthday during my stay, and the hotel gave me a fruit birthday cake. Thank you very much to the waiter Huang Hongying. Just a suggestion, the basement can be cleaned up, it smells like a sewer.

Environment: Directly connected to the beach ~ very similar to the hotel layout over Haitang Bayüåù!

I really like the crystal lamp in the lobby! Here's how to keep it spotlessly clean! The crystal lamp in the common area ü•π! The two floors are nearly seven meters! It's really clean and beautiful!
I stayed for two days and kept walking around, but I didn't actually experience the hotel well. I am looking forward to my next visit and will definitely choose to stay again!

Then when I was eating breakfast, I heard that the brand will be removed in May... I will hand it over to Fairmont... very very very sadüò´!
There will be no Shangri-La after Haikou...
How could the owner be like this... You can change it if you say so! ü´† Not happy!

The first time I lived in Shangri-La was in Tanjung Aru, Sabah. Since then, I have always liked the resort style and service of Shangri-La. As a regular customer, I will definitely give it a 5-point praise. But for Haikouxiang, I still want to make two comments:
1. The security monitoring of the hotel is still not enough, there is no fence around, a few warning ropes, outsiders can enter at will, I went to three outdoor hot spring pools, two of which are not customers of the hotel at all, after talking with them, I learned that they are coming to Haikou for the winter nearby residents. Security needs to learn from the guy next door.
2. The level of very few customer service staff needs to be improved. I want to continue staying after staying for two nights. I can understand that Ctrip‚Äôs room coupons are not available. I want to apply for a discount for extending the stay. I can accept it if it doesn‚Äôt work, but The tone has to be more polite, there is no need to be so tough, it makes people angry, and I was so angry that I changed to Wanmou Hotel. Of course, this is just an individual case, and I am satisfied with most of the service staff.

In terms of entertainment facilities, they are very complete. Bringing children to the hotel to stay in the hotel is simply freeing your hands. But the beach is public, relatively far away, you have to cross the road.

msg:The facilities are a bit old, and there is a road to go to the beach, and there is a long detour if there is no intersection. Can't it be an underground passage or a bridge over the street? The other thing is to ask the hotel not to engage in the practice of "one fish, two meals". If you sell a suite, can you sell it as two single rooms if you close the interior door? I booked a deluxe sea view room. The sea view is hard to describe. When I checked in, I found that the next door could hear clearly. Later, I found out that the sound insulation was not good, because it was just a room. And it is said that rooms 54 and 55 on each floor are like this, but fortunately, it was remedied by changing rooms. Even a high-end express hotel would not dare to play this kind of magic operation. It is not such a way to reduce costs and increase efficiency. It will affect Shangri-La's reputation too much.

It's an older hotel, the room is not too big, and it's a bit old. I was a little disappointed when I entered it at first, but the room is well maintained. There are many surprises and small details in the garden, like it üëç
Across the road is the beach, the sand is not fine enough, but the beach toys borrowed by the hotel are very clean, which is one of the best parts of my whole experience. In the end, my children and I washed them clean and packed them back.
The room experience part is disappointing, but more heart-warming. Special thanks to Holly for patiently helping me when I consulted before and after booking. And the little brother by the pool helped us find our lost slippers. These details and services make people warm.
I hope that the hotel will strengthen the sanitary details. Although there are many people during the holidays, I hope to be more considerate. In addition, the room service must be careful at night, because I got up early that day and went to bed early at night. When I was sleeping soundly, I felt someone knocking on the door. I thought it was a dream when I was half asleep, and then I received a call saying that the things were delivered. The door is locked and cannot be sent in. The person was woken up, but was dazed, and then fell asleep again. Thinking about it later, I felt a little scared. If I forgot to lock the door and the waiter brought things in, I would be terrified, and the other sleeping soundly would be very uncomfortable to be woken up. But except for the wrong room number, other processes are also responsible for them. Hope to check the room number in the future.
The whole process was a bit twists and turns. In the end, I am very grateful to the hotel for contacting the doll I left behind and helping to send it.

msg:It's the rabbit who is used to serious reviews again! For a temporary weekend trip, I chose Shangri-La according to the hotel brand when I first arrived in Haikou. Overall, it is good. The swimming pool has a large courtyard and many swimming pools. The beach is just across the road from the back door. The service is quite satisfactory. When I checked in, someone else was checking out. The front desk sent a travel sample and hoped to give a good review, but I didn't check out. Huh... The room is very big and clean, including the balcony. This must be praised. Disadvantages: 1. Because it is close to the ferry port, the surrounding traffic is seriously blocked by vehicles queuing up to cross the sea every day. I can‚Äôt get in or out by taking a taxi. I even had to get off the car and walk back to the hotel once. The weather is not good In good times, it is estimated that it will be blocked. 2. Takeaway can only be placed on the table at the entrance of the hotel or taken by yourself, and will not be delivered to the room. I feel that the old high-star hotels are not keeping pace with the times. Even ordinary business hotels will deliver food to the room. 3. The view room I booked is on a lower floor, facing the conference center next door, and the view from the window is mediocre. It is recommended that everyone upgrade to a sea view room, as the view is much better.

msg:Strongly do not recommend staying. Unless you want to have a bad experience like me. 2 nights and 3 days of accommodation, do you suspect this is a Shangri-La?
1. Hardware problems. Hardware is very old. Prepare mentally for this. But still a little surprised to see the rug and the child's low stool (see photo). There is no welcome fruit in the package, and it was delivered long after the phone call. The second room was sent after a while.
2. Environmental issues 1. The hotel's selling point is that it is close to the public beach. If the public beach is under construction, it should be noted or informed in advance. There was no notice before we checked in. I was happily preparing to go to the beach with my child, and the health center on the first floor told me not to go during maintenance. We were stunned. We said that we were playing on the beach. We went to the beach and did pull up the red block (see the picture). The construction team made a lot of noise from the heat. And the sound of the hotel's lawnmower.
3. Environmental issues two. If you can't go to the beach, go to the hot spring. After all, the hotel is a selling point. It is a pity that only 1 of the 3 pools is open (2 closed see pictures). 1 small pool already had 2 guests. Can't get into the water at all.
4. Software problem one. Before check-in, we received a call in advance to inquire about the arrival time. We told us from 12:00 to 13:00. The front desk said that two rooms would be prepared in advance. We are very happy that the hotel is seriously preparing for reception. But after the day arrived, there was still a room being cleaned and it took more than an hour to wait. We had to change rooms.
5, software problem two. The door connecting the external children's park and the hotel could not be opened by swiping the door card (see video). The first time I couldn't open it, I called the front desk, and the front desk came down and opened the door from the inside. I would recommend that they either fix it or don't close it, otherwise it's very troublesome for kids to get in and out. I didn't expect to encounter the same problem in the evening. The child and mother were locked outside and could not get in. Can only wait for someone to contact the front desk. The second and third days were still locked out.

The above is the experience of the afternoon after checking in that day. After some of this I wish to check out early, pay for the first night and move to another hotel the next night. The hotel informed me that the public beach is not managed by the hotel and cannot be intervened; the hot springs are open (yes, 1). Therefore early check-out is not possible.

It is recommended that you read the reviews and negative reviews in advance before booking this hotel. Choosing the wrong hotel is a trivial matter, and it is difficult to make up for the delay in having a good time with your family. From the bad reviews at the back of the hotel, I found similar feedback from other guests. Maybe if this evaluation is made, the hotel will still reply "the management attaches great importance to it" and "feedback to the relevant depar**ents". Please believe me, this hotel will not change the reaction to swiping the card from the children's park.

It is suggested that Ctrip: cancel the logo of the hotel's hot spring hotel. Cancel the logo of the hotel Sea View Hotel. so as not to mislead consumers.

msg:I have lived in Shangri-La for more than ten years, and the service attitude, service efficiency, and hardware facilities are all unbearably poor. ÔøºÔøº

All inquiries at the front desk were done perfunctorily. When I called the service center, the staff across from me laughed and chatted with other waiters and hung up on me many times. The explanation given by the manager was that there was a problem with the system, so whether it was human Hanging up the phone or having a problem with the system is completely ridiculous.

When we were going out or returning to the hotel at the hotel entrance, we were packing big and small bags, and the staff next to us were watching over there. No one came up to help us, and no one opened the car door. When asked to help carry the luggage, they rolled their eyes. The specific person who rolled his eyes was the person on duty at the hotel entrance at 2:00 in the morning on May 2.

The quality of the breakfast was extremely poor, and the vegetables were completely stale. At the critical point when breakfast was about to be canceled, the waiter next to me suddenly rushed up and threw away all the rice while I was preparing it. Why couldn't it be thrown out after I had finished picking up the vegetables? I asked, service The explanation given by the staff was that they would take it away at the right time because I was late.

I got the best room this time, so I could only stay in a regular room for a few nights. The work quality of the room cleaning staff was extremely poor. The bathroom sink was not wiped, the stains on the floor were not wiped, the toilet paper was not replenished, and even two people were required to wear masks. Just give one, there is a problem with the bathroom pipes, water stains are constantly overflowing.

When I asked the waiter for a bag, I asked the waiter five or six times but still didn‚Äôt hear the same thing.
After not seeing each other for two years, Shangri-La's service attitude is beyond expectations. From many aspects, it cannot be said that there are several aspects that are dissatisfied. It is that I can't find a single satisfactory aspect despite my best efforts.

For the past ten years, every time I come to Haikou, my first reaction is to come to Shangri-La. I think I have a lot of connection and affection with Shangri-La, otherwise I wouldn't have asked the manager for feedback, but no matter how deep the affection is, it cannot withstand such abuse.

I dare say I will never come again. If you don‚Äôt make corrections, your Shangri-La is really losing a lot of people.

‚ñ´Ô∏èThe deluxe king bed room we booked is upgraded to a deluxe sea view king bed room for free, 45 square meters, the 2-meter queen bed is very comfortable, the balcony is facing the swimming pool and the beach, the scenery is good
‚ñ´Ô∏èüà∂Ô∏èFull-length mirrors, refrigerators, bathtubs, irons, and all the daily necessities that normal hotels have (toothbrushes are huge and uncomfortable, slippers are super comfortable, thick and soft), üàöÔ∏èMicrowave ovens
‚ñ´Ô∏èüà∂Ô∏èIndoor and outdoor swimming pools, gyms, indoor and outdoor children's play facilities (all very good), outdoor hot springs were not open when we went

‚òëÔ∏èGift service
‚ñ´Ô∏èFree fruit plate + four bottles of drinks upon check-in
‚ñ´Ô∏èFree travel photography for 50 minutes, 5 negatives, we used it to take wedding photos, to be honest, the photographer's equipment and level are very average... But it is much more convenient than our own tripod shooting, so I am still very happy üòÇ Although it's average, it's not ugly. I took dozens of pictures and chose 11 pictures. Except for the 5 pictures that were sent, I spent money to buy 6 pictures. In the end, I gave one more picture. The total cost is 38*6=228, and I got 12 pictures. The seaside wedding photos that can be repaired a little by yourself
‚ñ´Ô∏èHaikou Riyue Plaza duty-free shop shuttle bus
‚ñ´Ô∏èShenzhou car rental 50 yuan coupon (I have already rented a car and found this, it is useless üò≠)
‚ñ´Ô∏èFun personal play activities (suitable for families with children)

‚òëÔ∏èHotel service
‚ñ´Ô∏èSuper good! I added customer service before I went there. If there are any questions, I will reply in seconds. We went out to take wedding photos. I kicked the bow on the high-heeled shoes by myself. I brought a pair of cotton slippers, because I was afraid that my shoes would be broken and it would be inconvenient to walk. Later, we walked to the beach to take pictures, which really came in handy! When checking out, Dabai casually complained about the loud construction noise outside, and the customer service came to me to apologize

‚òëÔ∏èTransportation
It is a 45-minute drive from the airport, and it is very convenient to the scenic spots along the coast. You can play along the way from near to far:
üìçHoliday Beach (6.2km/10min)
üìçXixiu Beach (8.8km/14min)
üìçHaikou National Sailing Base Public Pier (12km/22min)
üìçWanlu Garden (14km/24min)
üìç Yundong Library (17km/29min)
üìçHaikou Bell Tower + Arcade Old Street (18km/29min)
üç¥ Recommended places to eat nearby:
üìçWuyuanhe Farmers Market (4.2km/9min, seafood processing)
üìçXiuying Times Square Convenience Life Circle (11km/17min, authentic noodles)

‚òëÔ∏è Disadvantages
During our stay, it happened that the government construction outside was very noisy. From six or seven in the morning until more than nine in the evening, because it is not inside the hotel, the hotel can't do anything about it. Fortunately, we spend most of the day playing outside. If we are in the hotel If you rest for a long time, it will really affect the check-in experience. If you mind, you can call ahead to ask if the construction is over (we are under construction during our stay on 22/10/11-22/10/13)

msg:While I was in Hainan for work, I wanted to go to Sanya, but after hearing the news that there was a confirmed case, I ended up staying only in Haikou.
When I checked in, I was impressed by Ivy Wang's friendly service!
They take care of this and that carefully, and they upgraded the room to an ocean view even though it was almost fully occupied these days because it is the Tanabata Festival, and when I checked out, they gave me a L'Occitane amenity gift. I think the staff here are skilled and take better care of them~~~
Actually, it's the Tanabata Festival these days, so the price is too expensive, so I just booked a regular room, but thanks to the upgrade, I think I had a good vacation with a beautiful sea view from the room~
If you are coming with children, it is always Shangri-La in Haikou.
There are no restrictions, so even if you walk around in a swimsuit or bathrobe, no one will say anything. Living in China and being informal like this is so convenient ^^
It's not a private beach, but it's almost like a beach for guests, and the sand is white and clean.
During the day it is too hot to play on the beach, and at sunset there are many people.
You can catch small fish with your hand or bowl, and small crabs occasionally appear. kids love it
The hotel is old, but it seems to have been remodeled. The bathroom or room style is fine. We had a lot of fun going back and forth between the outdoor pool, indoor pool, and jacuzzi.
The breakfast is delicious and the rooms are spacious.
The kids love it so the next time we come to Haikou, we will come to Shangri-La again.
Ivy, please take care of me even then~

Nucleic acid walks through the back door and walks through the swimming pool. There is a pavilion for nucleic acid at the beach. There are a lot of people queuing up. The room is dilapidated and has a musty smell. When you open the balcony door, the air conditioner automatically turns off, making the air in the house dirty, which is unfavorable. Because of the ventilation, the breakfast room is so-so. There is a long queue in front of the noodle stall. I also saw some unpleasant things happen. While waiting for Didi in the hotel lobby, a cleaning staff helped a black car driver Soliciting customers, yelling hard, feels like ripping off customers. The Chinese restaurant Shang Palace is quite satisfactory. Sometimes there will be a wait for a table. The price is moderate, the taste is bland, the service is average, and reservations are not allowed.

Personally, the Shangri-La room style is better than the Marriott next door. During the stay, it happened to be my father's birthday. The surprise was that a classmate named Liu Yudie brought a cake from the concierge (or the guest room?), and my father was very happy. The room is clean as always, the standard of service is high, and the balcony has a beautiful view of the sea. Maybe because of the summer, the occupancy rate of the room is relatively high, the location of the breakfast room is tight, and the quality of the food is ok. I have already recommended friends, and when you come to Haikou, you can consider Shangri-La.

Shangri-La was within walking distance of the venue, so I took my baby to the weekend for a seamless vacation. Compared with the peak price of the previous two days of exhibitions, the two-night parent-child package is very cost-effective. The hotel is generally quite satisfactory, but the facilities are old and should be refurbished; the outdoor swimming pool is good, and it is a little bit of an internet celebrity; the food and beverages are average, the breakfast category is repeated every day, and the small program of in-room meal delivery will never remind you what meals are sold. Out of stock (just wait for the phone to change dishes after placing the order), Shang Palace's Chinese-style set menu for two is basically not enough. . . Anyway, there is a distance from the normal level of Shangri-La.

We picked the Shangri-La Hotel at random and it left a very good impression on us. Due to the epidemic in Meilan District, Haikou, there were not many guests staying at Shangri-La Hotel in Xiuying District, and the gym and Chinese restaurant were temporarily closed. But the outdoor pool and spa are open as normal. The hotel also has a hot air balloon project, which will be experienced next time. Shangri-La's breakfast has never been disappointing. Even if there are not many guests, the variety of breakfast is no less than that of Sanya Shangri-La, with a dazzling array of choices. The duty manager yann gave a very warm check-in experience and provided a very professional and warm service. Praiseworthy üëç. The hotel is very close to the new harbour wharf, and it takes about 10 minutes to drive to the wharf. There is a Yuanda Trade City near the hotel, and there are dozens of barbecue restaurants to choose from in the evening. There are also restaurants in the trade city building, such as Haidilao, Jiu Mao Jiu and other chain stores. For nucleic acid testing, you can go to the nearby Women's and Children's Hospital, which is only a 10-minute drive away. The balcony of the hotel's sea view room has a calm and beautiful view of the sea. However, the road to the sea is blocked by railings and cannot go into the sea. I am very satisfied with this stay, and I will choose Shangri-La again next time I come to Haikou.

There are many children's activities in the hotel. Although some are closed due to the epidemic, it can be seen that the hotel is mainly parent-child. I stayed in a deluxe sea view twin room, two beds can be put together, 2.4m, two big and one small are enough to live in. Although the sea in Haikou is not very good, the sunset on the sea is still beautiful. The hotel does not have its own beach, public beach, It is under construction, but it does not affect children playing with sand. The sea water is slightly turbid, and the sand is not too delicate. It cannot be compared with Sanya, but it is enough for children to play. The hotel is a little old, but the service attitude is still very good, although the waiters are generally young and lack some experience. The hotel currently has a bubble fight at 5:30, which is the children's favorite. There is a hot spring pool, which is relatively small and can be bubbled when it is cold at night. Next to the hotel is Marriott, which is more business-oriented and smaller. If you have children, Shangri-La is the first choice. There will be another duty-free shop nearby, which should be very convenient for shopping in the future.

Both indoor and outdoor swimming pools are free. It seems that the indoor pool is closed at 10:00 and the outdoor pool is 9:30. You can ask the front desk for details.
Overall: this hotel is OK~

After all, it is a 12-year-old hotel, and the room facilities are a bit old, but there is no problem with hygiene. The deepest impression is the heated swimming pool and gym. The swimming pool is too warm, and the gym equipment is also very complete. There are many people in the lobby bar in the afternoon, and there are afternoon tea buffets and the like. I wanted to find a place to have coffee around six o'clock, but I didn't expect everyone to eat at the lobby bar. The fly in the oin**ent is that the hotel's beach is under construction, and there is an artificial island in the sea, which is not so beautiful. Overall I think the service of this Shangri-La is better than the hardware.

It can be said that playing in the hotel is enough. The shortcomings are also obvious, the sea can not compare with Sanya; all kinds of towels are already very thin, it is time to change; the big bed is made of two small beds; the spare room is L'Occitane; it is understandable that the parent company of Shangri-La has a very close relationship with Coca-Cola cooperation, but the ice dew is really not good enough, but four free drinks can be considered as compensation.

Before I came here, I always wondered why such an old hotel can stay at the top of the list of parent-child hotels in Haikou for so long. After experiencing their parent-child activities, garden swimming pool and friendly service, all my doubts have been answered. When we checked in, when we saw there were children, the lady at the front desk gave us shell necklaces. Sister Chen Meidan from the housekeeping depar**ent was very enthusiastic and brought us fruits, snacks and anti-epidemic kits as soon as we arrived in the room. If there is anything that needs to be improved, I think the bedding and towels can be updated. In addition, there is room for improvement in the quality of breakfast.

During breakfast, there were no guests, and within a few minutes of picking up a meal, the table of breakfast that had not been eaten was carefully selected and thrown into the trash!

When we checked in, the front desk was greeted by a beautiful and sweet staff (a beautiful woman whose name was ‚àΩXiaoxin). The thoughtful and warm service made us very happy and warm! The hotel room is clean and spacious, with a view to the sea, sitting on a chair on the balcony, facing the sea, is in a great mood. The hotel's breakfast is very delicious, especially the fruit on the dining table is fresh and delicious. The staff in the fruit area is also a seductive beauty (remember the name is ‚àΩ Huang Xiaoling). The service makes people feel like the little girl next door, kind and lovely. We stayed for 2 nights, and the room cleaning was very satisfactory every day. There was a waiter named Gao Zhongsheng, who felt as cordial and comfortable as the little brother next door. When we checked out, the front desk manager ‚àΩLinda handled it for us, and the service attitude made people feel like family. If it wasn't for the flight ticket, I was reluctant to leave, and I really wanted to stay for a few more days. In short, I feel that living in this hotel is comfortable, the service is warm, and it makes people very happy! Here's a thumbs up for Shangri-La's staff! Thank you all! Because of you, next time I come to Haikou, I will choose here again, we will have a future!

In September this year, I stayed at the Shangri-La Hotel in Haikou again. As soon as I arrived at the hotel, I was amazed by the lobby environment and the hotel‚Äôs services. The hotel also gave me a free upgrade to the sea view room with invincible sea views, especially thanks to Xiao Sui at the front desk for his warm service , I did not expect to meet the assistant chef again in the Chinese restaurant and greet him warmly! Of course, the Shangri-La Hotel is my first choice this time because the packages sold by Ctrip are very cost-effective, including breakfast and dinner, as well as a trip to the hotel, which is the hotel‚Äôs trip to shoot ducks. Make an early reservation for the shooting time. The photographer waits with the shooting props. I gave clothing suggestions. The shooting process was very professional. I took a lot of satisfactory photos within an hour. The photographer was called Dongzi, and the producer contacted Jingjing. Thank them very much. I am very satisfied with this trip. I will choose to stay in Haikou Shangri-La Hotel in Haikou next year!
I like the hotel‚Äôs outdoor garden swimming pool. I go swimming every time I get to the hotel. I also go swimming when I get up in the morning and then have breakfast!

In particular, Miss Sui at the front desk in the lobby is kind and attentive, efficient, and can help solve problems. The smile is better than the inertial smiles of other young ladies. The most satisfying Shangri-La stay experience.

msg:Spend a little weekend with mom. It was very late that day, but it was a waste of not having the buffet dinner. But Xiaochao was very warm and nice at the front desk. Help arrange the room. The arrangement is right on the beach, super nice and super happy. Pretty awesome! The breakfast is delicious and the buffet dinner is even better. The service is very good. good environment. You can go to the beach. The only thing is that the hotel is open. Visitors outside can enter the hotel area at will and feel free to swim. Hotels with poor privacy should be guarded by fences or gatekeepers

msg:The hotel is great and the garden layout is beautiful. Although the beach is not as good as Sanya, it does not affect the children's enthusiasm for sand digging. The swimming pool is very clean, and the weekend bubble party in the children's pool is very fun. Every waiter is very friendly and gives us some help and reminders from time to time. Every day is very pleasant. Thank you Xiaofu for carefully arranging our stay; thanks to the waiters Lin Shuqin and Feng Xiaodie for cleaning our room very clean every day, and we delivered fruits and biscuits. I would also like to thank Mr. Han Dianping from the restaurant. Every day, he took the initiative to bring tableware and bibs to the children, as well as delicious yogurt, and recommended a play route. It was so thoughtful! Next time I come to Haikou, I will choose Shangri-La.

Shangri-La Haikou is located in a particularly good location, next to the seaside, and children‚Äôs facilities are also complete. The front desk has also upgraded a sea-view room for free. I also presented soft drinks and fruits. Thank you very much. I also came across a small order from a Sichuan fellow. I was very happy. When I left, I also gave L‚ÄôOccitane's travel wash jacket. It is very considerate. I will stay here next time I go to Haikou!

1. The room is very, very far away from the elevator entrance, it takes a long, long walk to arrive.
2. The room is very slanting to the sea, and you can see a little sea from the balcony. But I booked a room with a view, and I am not morally kidnapped by not giving me a sea view in the off-season. I understand and accept.
3. Cleaning at 9:39 in the morning, I press the doorbell three times in the morning. I want to relax and sleep late after working overtime until the early hours of the morning. Why do I disrupt my sleep! ! ! ! ! ! Finally thought that I could sleep. I have to bounce up immediately and press do not disturb
4. There is a musty smell in the room
