msg:The hotel is very new. Although it is outside the city, it is very convenient to get on the elevated road and it takes 20 minutes to get to the airport.
There was a musical fountain downstairs on the night of check-in.
The hotel also upgraded the suite, which was ridiculously large...
The service was also very good. I made an appoin**ent for the hotel's airport drop-off, but later I was told that the airport drop-off car was broken. The hotel took the initiative to transfer a 50 yuan red envelope (hotel to airport, express car, special car 45, 69 respectively), and the attitude was quite sincere.
The only drawback was that when my friend who stayed with me later went to make an appoin**ent for airport drop-off, the hotel just said that the car was broken and did not give corresponding compensation (my order and my friend's order were exactly the same), I don't understand why there was a difference in trea**ent.
Overall, it is still recommended. I will choose this hotel next time I go to Urumqi

Everything in the room is very new and clean, and the view outside is also beautiful at night. The breakfast is also very rich. I would like to make two hooks in the shower to hang the bathrobe before taking a shower, otherwise it will be cold to wear the bathrobe in the bathroom. I also hope that the toiletries can be improved. Such a high-end hotel should have special bath products, not small bottles that look like used ones. And cotton swabs and other details will be better if they are improved. Overall, it is very good and I recommend staying here.

Lying in the bathtub in the room and looking at the night view outside the window was a good experience. The pillow was a little soft when lying on the bed. I got up early and walked around outdoors. The air was fresh. If I could wait until the weather was hot, it would be better. I ate a lot of breakfast, which was twice the amount of usual breakfast. Because it was delicious, I ate a little greedily. I look forward to my next stay.

msg:This is a newly opened five-star hotel

Location: It is about 20 minutes' drive from the airport.
It is very close to the Tou Tun River Forest. I have stayed here twice. You can overlook the entire May Day Forest Park
Parking lot: There are ground parking spaces (quite large. You can park in the underground parking lot in winter), and there are plenty of parking spaces
Hotel facilities: The hotel room facilities are new, and the bathroom is made of marble
Bedding is relatively good, and the five-star linens are comfortable and soft
The room is very clean, with bathrobes, large room area, and beautiful night view.

Hotel service: The front desk is polite and enthusiastic, relatively professional, and will take the initiative to greet you when you enter the lobby and will also promote telecommunications fraud to you.
Surrounding environment: Next to the hotel is the Tou Tun River Valley Forest Park, where you can get up and run in the morning. It is quiet and suitable for people who do morning exercises. It was still green when I stayed here last time. This time it is a bit pale.
Hotel meals: There are many varieties of breakfast, and they are relatively rich. There are dozens of kinds. There are also many complementary foods.
A good hotel is worth promoting for our customers, and good service is worth our taste. I wish the hotel to do better and better and never forget its original intention.

After checking in, the air conditioner in the room was not cooling. (The air conditioner in the public area was very cool) until one o'clock in the evening. The indoor temperature was still only 24 degrees. Contact the front desk to communicate. At 1 o'clock in the evening, the front desk asked the engineering depar**ent to check. The master from the engineering depar**ent came and measured the temperature of the air outlet with a temperature measuring gun. It was about 24 degrees. I turned on the air conditioner at 16 degrees. After five hours, the indoor temperature was still 24 degrees. The master told me that this was normal. I said I couldn't accept it. I went to the front desk and expressed my willingness to change rooms. The air conditioning of the new room was normal. It was almost two o'clock by then. I went up I had to go up and down twice to communicate. The screen projection function in the room could not be used. The hot and cold water in the washbasin was connected backwards. The hotel at this price is relatively good. But the service and hardware level are honestly very average. Especially communication is very difficult. .I feel that employee training is not in place.

重點是酒店設施真的很差

房間內的空調出風口看着很長一條 其實衹有紅色的一小塊出風 這點風根本帶不動整個房間 一晚上都很熱

淋浴房 洗個澡 水都跑出來 要是真有人滑倒摔傷怎麼辦

最後房間沒窗户 不能通風換氣 整個房間很悶

服務方面 辦理入住的時候問前台早餐時間 竟然不知道 還要再去問別人  給前台打電話要求查看空調  半天都沒來人 理由是 辦理入住人太多 他忙不過來 但是夜裡23點 而且前台很多人員 這個理由很搞笑
