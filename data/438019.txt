The room itself is comfortable, but you can hear the people from the next room when they talk. The breakfast is good, but it is the same every day. The hotel boats a swimming pool and sauna, but when I asked about them, I was told they are closed.

Really lovely setting Just wasn't too impressed by the room Which had obviously seen better days. Pool on roof with a great view was a nice touch and breakfast had me set off for my journey in a good mood. Would come again, Just Hope for a better room.

msg:Do not stay here unless you are desperate. We spent our first two nights in the old town but after our road trip from ShangriLa decided to go for a “hotel” experience and thought we’d check out the tallest building in the city. The check in was drawn out and long, with tons of forms to fill out. ( we didn’t have to do this a few days earlier). The room we had booked was in the courtyard. The room felt damp and dark, right outside the window as a wall of a hospital around 20 metres away, so. I air or light really got into the room. The carpet was awful and the whole feeling was just a little gross. We complained and had to pay to change our room to the “main building” at which point they tried to over charge us. Having then been given a room on the 17ty floor, we had to change rooms again. The noise from the street and surrounding  KTV was unbearable even with the windows closed and at that height. Upon getting our third room, we collapsed on the bed exhausted. Gym closed, average breakfast, dinghy room. Not at all 5 stars even by local hotel standards. Get yourself a room in the old town and ignore this place. The best thing about it was the bell man came to move us between rooms each time, always with a smile and tried to be helpful, but shame he works for such a terrible hotel.

msg:It is worthy of a long-established high-star hotel, and the off-season experience is also excellent!
transportation:
It is adjacent to Shangri-La Avenue, the main road. The convenience of public transportation, taxis, self-driving parking, etc. is much better than that around the ancient city!
environment:
The building itself has a good foundation. The advanced and over-standard design of the year can still feel the glory of the past.
One of the few high-rise buildings in the city, it stands out from the crowd. The view from the high-rise rooms is unobstructed and very eye-catching.
There is a treasure camera with a 360-degree view at a certain location, but now it is extremely deserted. When I first saw it, I was stunned for a moment, and then felt sad...
Serve:
The off-season has not affected the hospitality and service of the hotel staff. Greetings are everywhere. Thank you for your hospitality!
facility:
Nothing can withstand time. Wear, loss, and iterations are everywhere. They are not the latest, smartest, and most noble.
But they have been well cared for and maintained by the lovely group of [official people]. They have remained new for a long time and are getting stronger with age. They have not declined much compared to the past. Time moves very slowly here.
Some interior furnishings, equipment styles, and functional layouts can be said to have a sense of fragmentation across generations, or it can be said that this is time travel that can be experienced without a time machine.
Summarize:
I will come again, bring my family, and recommend friends to come~
Because of the official position, I have a deeper fondness for Lijiang.
May you find the right position and create greater glory!

Although it is a well-established hotel, the location is good, the room type is upright and the lighting is good. The stay is comfortable and peaceful. You can watch the Jade Dragon Snow Mountain while sitting on the sofa. The breakfast is great and the service attitude is good. Parking is convenient and very close to Lijiang Old Town. Although the facilities are in an old hotel, they are well maintained and very convenient to use.

Now the room can see the Jade Dragon Snow Mountain. When I get up in the morning and lie on the bed and see the sun shining on the Jade Dragon Snow Mountain in the distance, I feel happy.

msg:The service in the official room is the most praiseworthy 👍. As soon as we entered the lobby, there was a waiter who helped us carry our luggage, guided us to check in, and greeted us. It made us feel very friendly, just like going home. The room was also upgraded to a snow view for free. Room, you can see the Jade Dragon Snow Mountain from the room, the viewing effect is really nothing to say. Since we checked in late and we hadn't had dinner yet, the girl at the front desk patiently introduced us to Lijiang's food and the attractions we would visit the next day, which saved me time to do some planning. Although the room facilities are a bit old, they are hygienic and clean. The breakfast is rich in variety and meets our taste. The overall experience of staying here: the service is warm, attentive and considerate. The viewing effect on the 23rd floor is excellent. Next time I come to Lijiang, I will choose the official room💖👍

msg:Because I stayed at Guanfang Hotel in Tengchong and it felt very comfortable, it was natural to choose Guanfang Hotel when I came to Lijiang. This is an old five-star hotel built in 1998, and the service is nothing to say. They took the trouble to check out the room before making a reservation, and even upgraded the room for free. The furniture in the 26-year-old room was well maintained and only had a sense of age and was not damaged. The breakfast is also very rich and worthy of the star rating. A safe parking lot is a must-have item for our self-driving tour. We recommend it to friends who are traveling by car. You can see the Jade Dragon Snow Mountain from the hotel room, and you can also see the Rizhao Jinshan Mountain from the top floor (it depends on your luck, the weather is good😄)

msg:After reading the reviews on Ctrip, even though there was only a double bed room (for a family of three), I decided to place an order. After arriving at the hotel, a middle-aged female staff member of the hotel was very enthusiastic. She checked in quickly and took her to the room in person. Later, she helped to ask questions. The front desk transferred us to a double room. I originally planned to stay for only one night and then transfer to another hotel. However, during my stay, I felt that the hotel staff provided meticulous service and were truly guest-oriented.
The room rate during the Spring Festival should be the most cost-effective in Lijiang, and it can be called the conscience of Lijiang's hotel industry. Although the hotel facilities are a little older, they are clean and hygienic. During the Spring Festival, the hotel offers a buffet for guests at 118 yuan per person, with many varieties, which is great Got it

As soon as I entered the hotel lobby, I was greeted warmly by a short-haired female staff member. Help with luggage and introduce the hotel situation. I asked her for advice on how to go to Jade Dragon Snow Mountain. The staff member's introduction was very reliable, and the one-day tour booked on the official website was great as she said. Both parents are satisfied. They also reminded us that if we leave early in the morning, we can pack breakfast for us in advance. And we have been emphasizing that if you have any questions, please call 0 or 1 directly for feedback. The family room booked this time. You can see the Jade Dragon Snow Mountain from the room. The breakfast at the hotel is also great, starting at 6:30. Rich variety, very satisfied. The best hotel on this trip. There is human warmth. Truly feel at home.

msg:Built in the late 1990s, the guest room facilities are "old-fashioned" or "very contemporary" compared to the popular B&B hotels today, but they are not outdated - everything needed is sufficient and easy to use. . What is particularly worthy of praise is the service displayed and provided by the staff in all positions of this hotel, from attitude to efficiency and quality, which has been rare in the hotel industry in the past ten years. We moved here from a more prestigious antique hotel in the ancient city. That hotel has the characteristics of a traditional residence, but the environment and the noise from the neighbors made it impossible for us to have a rest. After moving to this hotel, even though there were a large number of people staying on the same floor, the hotel's solid structure and good sound insulation, and the thick carpets effectively blocked and reduced the sound caused by the movement of people, allowing us to sleep soundly for three nights. Breakfast is also very rich. I ordered and ate at a Chinese restaurant once, and the quality of the food was excellent. I felt it was no worse than the restaurants I followed following Dianping. The price was more suitable, and the dining environment was good and convenient.
Although the revolving restaurant on the 23rd floor is not open for business, the view from it is probably the best in Lijiang. Whether looking at the snow-capped mountains or the cityscape, this place feels like it is unique and unrivaled. The attached picture is a partial view of the sunrise and sunset over the snowy mountains and the city at sunset, taken in the revolving restaurant on the 23rd floor.

In short: this is a highly recommended hotel. Good location, good price, good service!

msg:I chose Lijiang and this hotel as my first stop on my trip to Yunnan from the Northeast. Reviews said that although the hotel was a bit old, I could see the snow-capped mountains from the room, so I made a firm choice. The process also verified that my choice was very correct. The hotel is located in a quiet location, surrounded by supermarkets, hospitals and commercial streets. It is also very convenient. It is not far from the ancient city attractions and takes a taxi for more than ten yuan. The suite has four beds, one large, two small, and a bathtub. There is plenty of hot water 24 hours a day. The breakfast is quite satisfactory. A family of four lives very comfortably. The climate here is dry. The hotel room has a humidifier. It is very thoughtful. The floor-to-ceiling windows on the 23rd floor have a view. The night view of the ancient city and the snow-capped mountains are also amazing. Let’s talk about the hotel’s service. If I could give full marks, I would add ten more points to the hotel staff. First of all, it is one of the few stores in Ctrip’s history that has requested a note in advance and received an immediate reply from the hotel. When the family entered the lobby, the manager greeted them warmly. The smiles and cordial greetings eliminated my unfamiliarity with this city. Because it was my first time to go there with the elderly and the young, I underestimated the actual situation. The elderly had serious symptoms of high fever. After explaining it to the hotel front desk, they always paid special attention to us and also paid attention to us. Oxygen bottles were specially sent. Because I was afraid that the old man would not be able to bear it, I temporarily changed the itinerary and canceled the accommodation for the next day to go to Dali. Although I did not feel the sacredness of the snow-capped mountains, I felt the warmth of family here. Before leaving, the manager of the hotel specially walked us to the door and chatted with us for a long time until the car came to see us off. I sincerely thank this manager and wish your children to enter the ideal university.

The 360-degree revolving restaurant on the 23rd floor faces the entire Jade Dragon Snow Mountain, making it the best mountain-viewing hotel in Lijiang. The open ground parking lot in an independent courtyard is the first choice for self-driving customers. The breakfast buffet is clean and delicious, especially the freshly made Yunnan rice noodles, all three flavors are delicious. The hotel rooms are clean and tidy, with ample lighting, solid wood furniture, and high-grade bathroom supplies. The hotel is less than 1 kilometer away from the west gate of Lijiang Old Town. Park your car at the hotel, cross Qixing Street, and walk for 10 minutes. You can save one or two hundred on the parking fee alone. The hotel staff are enthusiastic and professional, and they proactively upgrade the suite standards. The heritage of an old five-star hotel is really not comparable to that of Internet celebrity hotels.

The tour group had almost finished eating. It was not friendly to people with drooling mysophobia.

msg:It was my first time to go to Lijiang. It was recommended by a friend. The breakfast was very good, the service was very good, and the parking space was sufficient. It was very close to the ancient town of Lijiang. However, the room facilities were a bit dated, but it did not affect the stay experience. You can enjoy the view of Lijiang City.

It is about 49 yuan for online taxis to go to Snow Mountain Visitor Center and about 28 yuan to Lijiang Station. The hotel's front desk service is very good, warm and thoughtful, and guests always go to the hotel entrance when entering. Welcoming people to help with luggage; although the facilities are a bit old, they are clean and tidy; there are many kinds of breakfast! I booked one night first and felt very good so I stayed another night.

It was warm in winter and was especially suitable for basking in the sun and drinking tea. Although the room was a bit old, it was very clean and could not be compared to a B&B. Yes, in the city center, the transportation is very convenient, and there is a viewing area at the highest point in Lijiang, which is an unexpected surprise👍👍👍

msg:My family and I stayed at this hotel for a total of ten nights. What impressed me most was the cleanliness and delicious breakfast. Finally, the hotel's service was also very good. The hotel is located in the city center with very convenient transportation. It is more than 10 kilometers away from the train station and more than 30 kilometers away from Sanyi Airport. Shopping and dining near the hotel are also very convenient. In the evening, there are dancing and bonfire parties in the square next to the hotel, where you can feel the life of the locals. We stayed facing Lijiang City, and we could enjoy the beautiful Lijiang City while sitting in front of the window. Like the sheets and quilt, they are very clean. The cleaning staff is very serious about cleaning every day. There is also a daily breakfast with a wide range of Chinese and Western food, as well as local specialties. My favorite drink is the hotel's coffee. It tastes good and I like it very much. During the time my family and I stayed in the hotel, the lobby manager Qu gave us considerate care and gave us good suggestions on our travel locations and itinerary. Thank you for her concern! When we finally left the hotel, Manager Zhou in the lobby helped us put our luggage in the car, and finally he shook hands with us and said goodbye. This trip to Yunnan brought beautiful scenery and wonderful memories. Guanfang Hotel is an important part of this beautiful memory. I will never forget the time I stayed in the hotel, let alone the people here. 😀

Service: The attitude of the front desk, bellman, and cleaning staff is very good and very polite.
Facilities: It was renovated before, but it can be seen that it is well maintained.
Landscape: The picture was taken from the room. The Snow Mountain Room faces the Jade Dragon Snow Mountain directly. Because of the height, the view is much better than that of the Ancient City Inn. Coupled with the avenue in front, the artistic conception is very beautiful. Unexpectedly, the weather forecast was not sunny, but the sun was shining on Jinshan Mountain. I sat in the room at 8 o'clock in the winter and watched it.
The high-speed rail taxi driver asked which government office there was. There might be two. Don’t go wrong. I’ll show the driver the screenshot address directly.
Breakfast: Not bad, the rice noodles are delicious. After coming down from Jade Dragon Snow Mountain, I was very tired. I had dinner at the Chinese restaurant on the second floor of the hotel. There was no crowd, but the taste and environment were not inferior to those of Internet celebrity restaurants in the ancient city. Soundproofing: Very good. You don’t have to worry about the sound of people talking upstairs in the B&B. I think it is a very cost-effective hotel in Lijiang and I am very satisfied.

As the first five-star hotel in Yunnan Province, the hardware facilities are inevitable for some time, but the maintenance is very good. For example, you don't need to wait for hot water to come out immediately when you turn on the faucet. The hotel's software and service standards are absolutely first-rate. As an "old tourist" who has been to Lijiang many times and stayed in various five-star hotels, I can responsibly say that the official room has the best value for money. From now on, it will be the official office

The biggest problem is that there are two separate buildings between the Naxi VIP room and the hotel, and there is no ceiling in the middle! I fell down when I came back on a rainy day. The sensor door was covered with anti-slip blankets. The problem is that the steps are not paved. This fall made me lose my mood when I came out to play. I was fine but my backpack was all wet.

msg:Before choosing this hotel, I was attracted by the five-star service reviews from other guests. Unfortunately, my actual experience was very different from these reviews. From the moment I stepped into the hotel, I felt the lack of service. When checking in, the front desk staff seemed more focused on chatting with people than greeting incoming guests, which made me feel rather awkward while I waited.

In addition, there is a lack of necessary guidance in the hotel. For example, there are no obvious signs in the breakfast area, making people feel helpless when searching. For a traveler looking forward to receiving travel advice and local guides, the hotel also fell short in providing assistance.

As for the facilities, although it can be seen that they have definitely stood the test of time, unfortunately, they do not seem to have been maintained and updated as much as they should. These old facilities are far from the five star standards I expected.

Nevertheless, I must admit that considering the price of 300 yuan per night, the conditions of this hotel seem to be worthy of its price. But for those travelers who expect five-star service, they may need to readjust their expectations or choose other accommodation options. Overall, this was a lesson that reminded me to pay more attention to the actual experience rather than just the ratings when booking a hotel.

The breakfast is quite satisfactory, the bread and snacks are good, and the rice noodles are okay. Breakfast starts at 6 o'clock, which is especially good because day tour groups leave early. Toiletries need to be improved. It is a star-rated hotel. It is recommended to add conditioner and cotton swabs. The booking price is more suitable. The swimming pool is not heated but is indoors at a constant temperature. It is recommended to go in the afternoon when the sun is shining😆

The hotel is strategically located, quiet in the middle of the hustle and bustle. It is convenient no matter where you go. The hotel's sightseeing elevator is very good. On a sunny day, you can enjoy the sunshine of Jinshan Mountain from a high place.
The hotel's catering has changed a lot. The food is rich in variety and has ethnic characteristics, which is very good!

The good thing is that the service here is really good. As soon as the taxi arrived at the lobby, a waiter took the initiative to help with the luggage. Two breakfasts were also given for free! Due to high altitude sickness in Lijiang, we wanted to move from the high floor where we originally lived to the lower floor. The lobby manager immediately mobilized staff to open the low-floor room that was not open for occupancy specifically for us! Here we express our thanks again! The revolving restaurant on the 23rd floor of the hotel has stopped providing services, but guests can still go up to the top floor to see the Jade Dragon Snow Mountain in the distance. If I have another chance to go to Lijiang, I will stay here again!

The hotel is very close to the ancient city, within 2 kilometers; the location is good. The front desk service is average and the attitude is lukewarm. I am very satisfied with the room. There is a sense of comfort when opening the door. Both the elderly and children like it very much. The price of the extra bed is too high and it is difficult for people to accept it. The room rate is already 700 yuan, and it’s damning that there is an extra charge for an extra bed! !

msg:I did some research before booking the hotel and read many people's reviews. The actual stay experience really exceeded expectations! Good place!
1. Although the hotel facilities are old, they are just "old" and very clean. At first, "old" and "dirty" are associated together. It is obvious that the hotel room is very clean, and there is no dust on the surface of the furniture. They were also very meticulous when cleaning the room. The furniture is basically solid wood, and you can clearly feel the weight when moving chairs.
2. The service attitude is excellent. It is indeed a five-star service. All requests are met promptly and answered patiently.
3. The scenery is excellent. As a landmark building in Lijiang, it stands out from the crowd. If you don't book a viewing room, you can also take the elevator next to it to the 23rd floor and see the 360-degree panoramic view of Lijiang.
4. I booked this room as a connecting family room with large floor-to-ceiling windows, overlooking the Jade Dragon Snow Mountain. This room is equivalent to a standard room and a double bed room connected in the middle. There is a door. Although it is not as big as a suite, it is particularly suitable. I took my baby around 3 years old and ran back and forth on both sides.
In short, it is very safe to live here, it is clean, and the safety is guaranteed. I will come here again next time I come to Lijiang.

The breakfast in the hotel is very rich. I stayed in eight hotels during this self-driving tour in Yunnan. The breakfast in the official room is the most varied and delicious. It’s super awesome👍
There is a small square separated by a wall outside the hotel lobby. Around 8:00 in the evening, there are many square dancers. There are three different types and groups of square dances, especially the group of local folk dancers. There are many young boys and they dance very well. Very interesting to see.

msg:Brothers and sisters, anyone who sees my comment and wants to live in the Naxi VIP House of the Guanfang Hotel is a warrior.
I stayed in Room 2106 of the Naxi VIP House of Lijiang Guanfang Hotel in early August, and spent 538. The difference in experience was unprecedented.
First, the facilities are outdated, letting Buddha travel through the last century. The overall environment is like the decoration style of the 1990s, and the curtains are also simple fabrics. I have stayed in many hotels and have never experienced such an accommodation environment in this price range. (with photos)
Second, the door was broken and couldn't be closed. The toilet room is so skewed that it takes an adult man to use all his strength to close it, and the switch makes a loud noise (with photos)
Third, the signal in the room is weak and there is no Wi-Fi. There is only one public Wi-Fi in the hotel room, and the speed is extremely slow. Moreover, the signal in the room is extremely poor, and the Internet is sometimes absent. The most important thing is that there is no Internet when you are ****ting in the toilet, which can help you divert all your attention to ****ting and smelling ****.
Fourth, as long as I touch the bedding of the hotel when I sleep, I will start to itch, so I can only take out the clothes in the suitcase and barely survive the night. (This article varies from person to person, for reference only)
Fifth, the Naxi VIP House is completely separated from the main building, and you need to go through a long corridor to check in at the back, so it is difficult for you to relate to the luxury facilities in the hotel. (with photos)
Sixth, let everyone see what is called a modern hair dryer in the 21st century (with photos)
In short, none of the five-star hotels in this external standard hotel is satisfactory. If you insist, it is a bit conscientious, and the bathroom has been redecorated. The price of more than 500, the five-star hotel, it is a joke to say it out, I hope all distinguished guests can read this comment before checking in.

Believe in the power of the brand, after all, it is a five-star hotel. 11 years ago, I lived in the official house on a group trip with my unit, and I was proud of it at the time. Now that I revisit Lijiang, I still want to reminisce again. Every employee of Guanfang regards himself as a member of the hotel and loves the big family of Guanfang. I went up to the old manager Qu at the front desk, went down to the doorman at the back door, and the concierge. I was lucky to meet Manager Qu in person, and even wronged her to help carry the luggage to the room, and upgraded to a superior room as usual. I was so touched. Thanks to the front desk for sending the mercury thermometer, as well as welcome fruit and milk tea, it is so touching. The next time I come to Lijiang, I will choose the official housing, because the location is so good, and because of a feeling, I will go back to the official housing to visit Manager Qu, and hope that she will take care of herself, and hope that the official housing will be better and prosperous every day!

Feeling warm all the time! If it wasn't because of the tight schedule, I really want to stay for a few more days! (I really want to remember each of her (his) names and make a list of praise)
The price of the hotel is very competitive (the price is too real, the three-star price, the five-star facilities and management, and the six-star service are really "high quality and low price"! The breakfast is also very good. Travel to Yunnan, after passing I stayed in 7 hotels in three cities. This is the one with the best and richest breakfast. I strongly recommend everyone to stay here.
By the way, in the room we lived in, you can see the snow-capped mountains from the window, and the downstairs seems to be the municipal square, and the night view is also very beautiful! Again recommend everyone to choose here!

msg:It’s the first time I came to Lijiang for the May Day trip. I didn’t choose those inns and homestays that looked exquisite. I chose this one for the snow-capped mountain view room and the title of the five-star hotel. Overall, it’s good, especially the front desk and the hotel. The service attitude of the staff in the lobby is very good. The room facilities are all wooden furniture, not very new but relatively clean, and all kinds of facilities are also very complete, but the hair dryer in the bathroom is not very easy to use, the wind is not strong enough to blow for a long time, and it is a bit hot and hot, which can be improved. Overall it's good.

It is very inconvenient to take a bath in the bathroom. You can only stand in the bathtub to wash or take a bath, but now the proportion of guests taking a bath is small. , standing in the bathtub to wash is afraid of damaging the bathtub (the bottom of the bathtub is elastic), so it is recommended that the hotel dismantle the bathtub and let the guests stand on the ground to take a bath, which may be better.

I saw that there is also a reminder to use the electric blanket, maybe the heating is not enough? The scenery is not bad, you can directly see the Jade Dragon Snow Mountain, in short, it is worthy of its price.

msg:I want to praise this hotel
Repeat three times "**** same hotel" "**** same hotel" "**** same hotel"
I regret the B&B I stayed in a few days before coming to Lijiang
Sure enough, B&Bs can't be compared with hotels!

1 Double bathrooms, 4 trash cans, 4 ashtrays. I have never seen such configurations. Even though I have stayed in several "super five-star hotels" in Beijing, they are far inferior to their configurations

2 The room comes with a mobile phone charging cable with three plugs. So considerate!

3 The hotel brochure in the room. I saw that Grandpa Jiang had also stayed here, so I knew I came to the right place

4 The airport bus station is 200 meters away from the hotel. It's so convenient!

5 Before booking, I read many reviews saying that their facilities are aging, which affected my judgment
I must conclude that their facilities are not inferior to many five-star hotels in Beijing. The B&Bs I stayed in at the same price don't even have hot water for bathing

Finally, thank the hotel staff. I can tell you with certainty that your hotel is much better than the B&B

The hotel is in a great location, in the city center, very convenient for public transportation and taxis, and only a ten-minute walk from Lijiang Old Town. Looking out the window to the Jade Dragon Snow Mountain, the night view is also very beautiful. The booked family room consists of two standard rooms separated by a door, which can be opened or closed, which is very good. The only drawback is that there are square dances in the square in front of the building at night, which is quite noisy, but it ends at 9:20. All in all, this stay was a very good experience and highly recommended.

The room rate is not too high, and the hotel is struggling under the epidemic. It is not easy for the official room to maintain such a service level. I like it and hope that the operation can improve day by day.

The service at the front desk is thoughtful and attentive, making people feel at home. It seems that this hotel is the tallest building in Lijiang, and the sightseeing elevator is facing the Jade Dragon Snow Mountain. You can take a lift to see the Rizhao Jinshan. The location is not far from Dayan Ancient Town, you can walk into the ancient city in about ten minutes.

msg:It is said to be the first five-star hotel in Yunnan Province. It is an old hotel in the 1990s. There are many antique-level facilities in the room, such as the hair dryer like a vacuum cleaner, and the seat cabinets all reveal the vicissitudes of life. I found a brochure in the drawer and found that many leaders have stayed here, and I suddenly felt that this hotel was very low-key.
After living in Lijiang for a while, I felt that the Guanfang Hotel should be the tallest building in Lijiang. Because of this, the snow room here has become the best Jade Dragon Snow Mountain view room. However, unfortunately, it was just in time for summer, the clouds and rain were frequent, and the snow-capped mountains had been hiding in the clouds and mist. After two days in front of the window, I could not see the whole picture of the snow-capped mountains. The photos of the snow-capped mountains are really shocking. Next time I come to Lijiang to choose an autumn and winter season, I still live here and wait to see the snow-capped mountains.
The transportation is very convenient, it is about 15 minutes walk from the waterwheel of Lijiang Old Town, the breakfast is very rich, and the restaurant environment is also very good.
The receptionist in the lobby was very enthusiastic, helped us get the report information, and also introduced the business situation of several nucleic acid testing points nearby, and gave us a thumbs up.

There is also the best snow mountain landscape in Lijiang City, after all, the building is tall enough

msg:I came back from Puxiu Hotel on the Snow Mountain because I didn't do nucleic acid. I planned to live in Jinlin Howard Johnson's receptionist. The attitude of rejection and discrimination ruined my goodwill towards Howard Johnson. Checked in at the nearest hotel
Check in late at night. The front office supervisor of the official room reception is very polite. He thought that I had just arrived in Lijiang and reminded me of the weather conditions. I specially arranged a room on a high floor. Whether it is the breakfast room or the front office service, it is worthy of recognition.
Yes, yes, but as soon as you open the door, you can imagine that it is 20 years back in time. Back to the 2000s, the historical sense of furniture and decoration of a four-star hotel in Guangdong is already written on the face. The spare parts are used. So retro that I took the room where I stayed at the Jinmao Hyatt the other day. I understood that the smell of the carpet was inevitable, so I comforted myself that I woke up one night and immediately went to the airport to occupy Lijiang. Although the highest location in the city has been open for a long time, it should be refurbished. The White Swan Hotel China Hotel was also fully refurbished in the 1980s. It doesn't feel old, but has a style that blends old and new. After breakfast in the morning, I hurried to the airport.
However, I am still grateful to be able to find a cheap hotel with convenient transportation at such a late night. The service of the hotel is trying hard to bring back the score of environmental hygiene. I should be ready next time to avoid rushing to book a hotel from 2k to 200.
(The two good-looking ones are the official room decoration of Jinmao Hyatt and Snow Mountain Hotel without the urge to take pictures)

However, these past glory cannot hide the present decadence of this hotel: even if the bathroom is dry and wet, it is still the configuration of this bathtub and shower 20 years ago. Can a normal person use this bathtub? Can't count how inconvenient this shower is? There is nothing in the mini bar except for a price list, which is also very strange... The hotel's gym and swimming pool are not open. Shouldn't this be stated on the information label? The hotel official should not dump the epidemic, the swimming pool 2 said, but the crowd density of the hotel gym has always been very low, and there is no need to close it. Other hotels rarely do this.
Takeout is not allowed to be delivered, but the hotel does not help you solve it. Come down and get it yourself... The tone is blunt and domineering, and it is full of bureaucratic a**osphere. Who do you think is not the hotel waiter but the leader?
This is the real lazy government. Using the excuse of the epidemic to take the opportunity to downgrade the service and downgrade the hotel facilities, it is a very speechless hotel.

msg:The Guanfang Hotel is the earliest five-star hotel built in Lijiang (it is also said to be Yunnan). Later, Lijiang did not allow high-rise buildings to be built, so it feels that the official hotel stands out from the crowd. The high temperature in most places in the country broke the table. I came to Lijiang with my wife to escape the summer heat. I booked for one night first. I felt that the reception staff and room service staff here were very polite, which made me feel like I was at a friend's house! The breakfast was also plentiful, so it continued for another six nights. The top 23rd floor here is a revolving restaurant. Although it has not opened due to the epidemic, the staff and waiters specially took us to visit. We even went up to take a few night scenes at night, which is great!
The breakfast here is very rich, but it doesn't feel that there is much change. One day, I gave advice to the staff. On the third day, there were some changes and new products were added. I hope that the hotel will pay more attention to the diversity of breakfast, and display Yunnan cuisine and Naxi cuisine to the fullest, as another highlight of the hotel to attract repeat customers!
The hotel is not far from the ancient city. I walk out every afternoon and eat "lunch and dinner" nearby. After dinner, I take a walk into the ancient city to enjoy the city view, night scene, beautiful scenery, beautiful scenery, human voice and singing. Children and adults are here! It never seems to get bored, there is something fresh every day! I lived in the official house for more than a week, and spent a beautiful and cool summer in Lijiang. Back in Beijing, there is already the coolness of the beginning of autumn! The experience was amazing! Thank you to all the staff of the hotel. I will come to Lijiang for vacation and stay in the official room in the future.

The tiny details make you feel warm! The hotel bedding is as clean, tidy and comfortable as always! Arrived late, and had dinner in the restaurant on the second floor of his house. The chef is very skilled, so that we can regain a lot of energy under the nourishment of delicious food! I have eaten in another restaurant in his house, overlooking the city of Lijiang. Due to the epidemic, the restaurant is temporarily closed. The breakfast is rich in variety, and there is a freshly fried, ball-shaped pie with a texture similar to fried dough sticks, which is super delicious! There is a workshop in his garden where he cleans the bedding (hehe, it should be called a workshop), which is rare!

Breakfast options are limited, quite satisfactory and acceptable.
The price/performance ratio is quite high.

The lobby is spacious, the restaurant is large, and the floor is high with four elevators and a large parking lot. What I like the most is the 20-storey building, directly facing the Yulong Snow Mountain in the sightseeing elevator. Sitting on the sightseeing elevator is like watching a documentary. Some rooms can also have snow mountain views. I booked a family room with two connected rooms with snow mountain views. It is worth the extra cost. The breakfast is very rich, the parking lot asks the front desk for a ticket, the only thing is to leave the ancient city 1.2 kilometers away, you still have to drive.

The family suite on the 16th floor of the hotel offers a far-reaching view of the top of Yulong Mountain. The lobby manager is very enthusiastic. After check-in, he will call to ask if he is satisfied. Back to the shop from Yulong Snow Mountain, the lobby bar enjoys a special afternoon tea, which is still a good experience. The breakfast buffet is very rich, with unique Yunnan rice noodles and a wide variety of sauces for free choice. Special praise: authentic chai eggs. Stay decisively for one night. By the way, the elevator can go directly to the 23rd floor, the circular viewing floor, overlooking the whole city of Lijiang.

服務：前台、行李員、保潔的服務態度都非常好，特別有禮貌。服務響應非常及時。
設施：裝修有年代感了，但保養得很好。
景觀：酒店有觀光電梯直麪雪山，乘電梯上下就可以欣賞玉龍雪山。雪景房是可以直接看到玉龍雪山的。頂層23樓還可以360度環繞欣賞整個麗江市區，景觀一流。
早餐：菜品豐富，最喜歡吃銅鍋米線；                                                                          隔音：很好，完全不用擔心民宿樓上隔壁説話聲音。
性價比超高的一家酒店，非常滿意，下次來還會選擇入住。

msg:酒店位置很不錯，雖然不在麗江古城內，但是離古城北門大水車很近，可以坐酒店的觀光電梯到達23樓，看麗江夜景，酒店也有游泳池，但因為天氣涼，孩子沒敢下水，早餐種類繁多，味道不錯，作為五星級酒店性價比很高，但是作為老牌五星，酒店的設施比較舊，是上個世紀90年代的感覺，洗浴產品較少，沒有護髮素，不過酒店房間有浴缸，可以泡澡，很贊。如果想選擇性價比高的五星級酒店，可以選擇官房酒店，樓層很高，也算是麗江的地標性建築，國家領導人曾經還住過。

唯一遺憾是室內空調聲音有點轟響，即使自己不開也有低頻聲不絕入耳，睡眠好的人可忽略不計，睡眠脆弱的就有點小折騰。

希望酒店越辦越好，下次如果有機會入住希望我提的問題能得到解決。

衞生：標準的國內五星酒店，床上衞生很乾凈
環境：我們入住的是雪山觀景房，早晨8點在床上看日照金山⛰️⛰️⛰️，晚上可看雪山日落🌇🌇🌇，我們來了多次都是入住這個房，值得推薦！
服務：服務員都很熱情，特別是大堂值班經理，早餐屬於中西餐，種類多，麗江小鍋米線味道不錯。

但是問題也不少；1、洗澡的地方在一個旮旯裏，淋浴的地方很狹窄（大概剛剛衹有一人寬的空間），不太方便；2、地漏下水很慢，基本是踩在水裡的；3、當晚信號📶不知道什麼問題，很不好，總掉線。
整體情況相比房費來説偏貴。應該不會再考慮入住。

首先酒店是老牌掛牌五星酒店，看的到旅委的標誌，但是坦率説設施真的老舊，被子也是黏黏的，雙床真心小，感覺重回90年代的酒店。
唯一的亮點是服務，各個部門的人員都很周到，前廳小哥彭傑必須給予好評，看到我身體不適，一直幫忙把行李從房間搬到車輛，服務超級熱情。

總體對這家酒店還是滿意的，而且最貼心一點是，酒店餐廳非常體貼早起的遊客，6點不到就可以用餐了，讓我驚喜不少。下次來麗江還選它。

    餐廳比較寬敞大氣，中西自助早餐品種非常豐富可口；門前和樓旁停車場停車位比較充裕，有保安現場照看安全便捷。
    當然，也還有提升的空間，比如房門的防盜鎖鏈扣缺失使客人的安全感打了折扣；床鋪狹窄不夠舒坦。

2、裝修老舊，木櫃子都變形了，水杯在櫃子裏，之前拿杯子的時候都沒在意，如果知道櫃子變形這麼厲害…我都不去動它了，倒了説不清楚。
3、1707的馬桶壞了，沖不下去……我看單單側紙都沖不下去…一晚上沒去大的…長輩在隔壁睡覺早，沒去打擾他們。第二天起床趕飛機匆匆走了。
4、1705之前入住的客人，用燒水壺燒/熱玉米類的東西，殘留的應該是玉米鬚和玉米粒在燒水壺裡。我們剛住進去，長者燒水喝，我也沒在意也喝了2壺茶。晚上長者睡了，我把水壺拿到我房間想再喝一些（還有半壺水，所以拿過來我房間），打開一看玉米鬚和玉米粒我傻了………（細看後分辨出的，一開始以為玉米鬚是………）噁心的我當時就扔旁邊了，再沒去碰……
5、大廳服務不錯，看雪山也還行……

總結裝修太老了……清理服務有瑕疵……和在大理住的沒法比……

msg:🍃環境：訂的雪山房，總共20層給了1504和1506，樓層夠高足以越過擋在前面的人行大樓和電信大樓。但1504由於角度問題觀賞雪山十分別扭，早上還會受隔壁玻璃反光影響，1506相比就好的多。不過窗户都不能完全打開，玻璃又有點不乾淨，影響觀景拍攝。另有觀光電梯也是正對雪山。

🧹衞生：打掃挺乾淨的，不過設施真的太老了，空調製熱效果差且十分乾燥，開了加濕器也難以緩解。電視機不是聯網智能的，衹能看模擬電視頻道且清晰度不佳，被子感覺又薄又硬，很難稱得上舒服。衞生間有浴缸，但木門有明顯裂縫。

🚗 交通：位置在市中心，去古城走路15分鐘，打車10元以內，周邊購物吃飯都很方便，外賣也不少。麗江人民醫院步行10分鐘。另外酒店有車行坡道和大門平齊，下車到進門再到上樓進房間不用走一步樓梯，適合行李比較多的遊客。

🔔服務：服務達標，沒有老國營酒店常見的生硬和冷漠，入住給攜程會員開了專屬通道。早餐自助尚可，但離對五星級酒店預期還有一定距離。

總體來説，200多的價位還是比較推薦的，再貴些就得掂量掂量了。

訂了兩間房，開房間的時候就給我開了一間，給我兩張房卡，上去一看，這麼多人，一間房怎麼住，又到前台去找，前台説漏開了。。這玩意兒還能漏開。。。無語。開好房間，有一間房卡還開不開門，又下去一趟找前台。
房間設備陳留，兩個房間的燒水壺都是壞的。，根本沒法用。
走的時候，孩子一條毯子落在酒店床上，打電話，服務員死活説沒有，我們再三肯定確定在房間，才説找到了。
就這酒店，還**能有生意，我很納悶

msg:服務意識非常好👍之前退房了，把行李放在酒店，結果事情沒辦完又續住了，早上退房時忘了兩塊蛋糕在冰箱裏，續住時想起來順口問了一句，晚上回去時酒店服務員説查房時就扔掉了，寫了道歉信還送了牛奶和小餅乾，瞬間覺得很不好意思，也很感動！點贊👍
