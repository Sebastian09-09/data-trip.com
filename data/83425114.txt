msg:Courtyard Room was comfortable, floor heating is a nice touch in winter. Location is good for hiking and walking around the resort, but far from restaurants - the only place within walking distance to eat is the resort’s two restaurants, both of which we found extremely overpriced. Breakfast food selection is same as 5* hotel.
Spa facilities could use some improvement - sauna was barely working and the massage jets in the two indoor pools were not working at all. 
Highlight of our stay: automatic coffee machine with delicious fruity coffee beans in the room, just for us - never seen in China before, loved it!!!

Nonetheless, the location is wonderful ... Peaceful, natural, and access to excellent cycling, hiking, and leisurely walks. 
Look forward to visiting again when the facilities are all open.
The spa massage therapy (ask for Monica) is excellent, and will no doubt get ever better once the Spa facilities are completed.

The check-in experience was very good. Every staff member was very nice. The shuttle bus was available on call (maybe because there were not many guests). There were many activities. The butler would send out an activity list every day.
The indoor swimming pool was very small, 48 square meters, but because there were not many guests, we reserved it.
The only complaint might be that the toilet in the room was too high. I was 168 cm tall and my feet just reached the bottom when I sat down. The hotel could prepare some small stools for children to use.
I was also given a cup when I left. Thank you.
In short, I will choose this hotel again next time.

The butler Jack is very good. When the child poked his finger with a bamboo thorn, he found an alcohol needle and a band-aid to treat it for the baby. Thank you very much.
The environment is great, very quiet and great. There is a shuttle bus at any time. At first, the resort seemed very big, but it doesn’t seem to be very big. You can walk to anywhere.
The Chinese restaurant and the Western restaurant are both very delicious. The eel shreds are delicious! You can also order dishes from the butler to the room~
The mountain courtyard we stayed in was great. It was very big. Two adults and one child slept on the tatami at night. There was also a bed that should be able to sleep two adults and one child hahaha!
I will come again if I have a chance

It is especially suitable for office workers to take their children to escape from the big city on weekends and find long-lost tranquility. The design of the resort is one step at a time. The buildings are different but complement each other. There is no sense of dissonance among the green mountains and green waters. In addition to the hardware, the service is also impeccable. I would like to give special praise to the housekeeper Shi Haofa. He has already taken care of all kinds of precautions before my trip even started. The service is enthusiastic and the attention to detail is great for two children of different ages. This is evident by the preparation of slippers of different sizes. All in all, Nanjing Naked Ridge is a place where it’s not easy to find faults.

🌼A few days before check-in, the hotel arranged a private butler Jack to serve me. Since entering the hotel park, every link has been arranged properly. All the staff I met will smile, greet warmly, and take the initiative to provide services, which makes people feel very intimate and comfortable.
☘️The forest cabin where I stayed has a quaint room and a large round soaking pool by the window, which is extremely private. The room is clean and tidy, the water bar has a wide variety of drinks, and you can also use a coffee machine to make freshly ground coffee.
💝The hotel has a variety of activities, including yoga, hiking, cycling, archery, bonfire parties, etc. You can choose to experience according to the schedule provided by the butler.
🥘There are Chinese and Western restaurants to choose from in the park. I chose the naked Western restaurant for dinner. The pan-fried Australian scallops and mushroom soup are impressive, and the dessert tastes good.
🏵️The hotel is very close to Wuxiang Water Town and Tiansheng Bridge Scenic Area. It takes 2 hours to visit each scenic area. It is recommended to visit Tiansheng Bridge during the day and Wuxiang Water Town at night.
🎁 When I left the hotel, I got a mug as a souvenir. Because of the amazing naked Ridge, I decided to experience other naked hotels next time. ٩(*´◒`*)۶

msg:[Naked Ridge] in Wuxiang Mountain
The air is fresh and quiet without crowds

The service is perfect. The shuttle bus is always on call. Entering the lobby is very ceremonial. I soak my hands in the water with newly picked peach blossoms to wash away the fatigue from the journey.

We arrived early and we were checked in in advance. The floor heating and air conditioning were turned on early in the room. As soon as we entered the room, we felt the warmth. The peach blossoms on both sides of the small courtyard happened to be in full bloom, just like in the book "Peach Blossom Spring"

There are many activities (the last picture is attached with an activity schedule), which is suitable for walking the baby. The baby can play in the amusement park, and I can do puzzles and take handicraft classes outside. You can free your hands even if you are raising a baby alone, which is touching

One-on-one butler Lcey provides 24-hour WeChat online service and gave a small gift and surprise when checking out.

The breakfast is also quite rich, and the waiter will also thoughtfully tell you that you can come back to eat at any time before 10:30. If the baby is not full, he can help you pack it away.

Naked Ridge is really suitable for walking kids. There are both outdoor and indoor children's parks. The cute pet parks are full of small animals. They can wander around freely. No matter which area you are in, there are staff who will come to ask if you need a connection. In the car, you can see mineral water and scented tea everywhere... When we were driving out of the park, we met the staff all the way. They all nodded and waved to our car enthusiastically, which made me feel embarrassed...

Maybe it's just luck that I came here this time. The cherry blossoms and peach blossoms are in full bloom. All the free activities in the handicraft workshop have just been implemented. In addition, there are very few people here on weekdays. You can really feel the slowed down time in the mountains in spring. , breathe and relax freely in the pure mountains and wilderness...

So she found this resort located in Wuxiang Mountain, Lishui. I love this kind of cabin in the mountains. The air is fresh and quiet and comfortable surrounded by mountains and forests. I would like to thank the butler Liro in particular. He is not only handsome, but also has a nice voice (he took us to check in, drove the shuttle bus to take me and the girl around the quiet and beautiful mountain forest road and explained it in detail. When we arrived at the room, he also carefully explained the room facilities and various usage matters. The girl said that this little brother has a really nice voice 😀), Liro helped us make a reservation for Chinese dinner. Well, I have to say that the Huaiyang dinner tastes very good. After breakfast, the girl wanted to go to the archery range but didn’t want to walk (lazy), so Liro arranged a shuttle bus for us. In the afternoon, the girl wanted to finish her homework in such a quiet mountain cabin. I thought the extension fee would be quite high. Liro heard that we needed to finish our homework, so he helped us apply for an extension until 17:00 without any additional charge. I was really happy. Anyway, this weekend was so happy 😃

msg:It was a perfect holiday experience. Driving into Wuxiang Mountain Scenic Area was like entering a paradise, and Naked Ridge was like a fairy resort in a paradise lying quietly in this piece of mountains and waters. We chose to live in a mountain courtyard, with unique fences and wooden doors, private and comfortable courtyard space, and a warm and spacious 60-square-meter room, which made us quite satisfied. The breakfast was great, and it was very pure and exquisite. I liked the American breakfast and Chinese beef noodles very much. It was hard to imagine that the hotel could grasp the taste of different styles of breakfast in China and the West so well. The activities in the hotel were very rich: cycling, hiking, plant rubbings, archery, feeding small animals, grooming ponies, red wine tasting, roasting marshmallows... I was also very lucky to win the first place in the archery competition and won a small doll gift. The children were very happy! From morning to night, both adults and children had a lot of fun. At night, I returned to the room, soaked comfortably in the round bathtub for a while, and then put on pajamas to fall asleep. The holiday life was so wonderful and fulfilling!
If there are places that can be done better, first, the hotel is in a natural environment, we can see a lot of insects outdoors, and we saw a lot of big bees and bumblebees several times, which made us feel a little scared; second, there is no garbage bag in the trash can in the room. I can feel that it is for the concept of environmental protection, but when eating the welcome fruit, I really can't bear to throw the peel directly into such a beautiful trash can. Fortunately, I prepared a garbage bag.
Finally, I would like to thank every staff member here, especially our exclusive housekeeper Miss Elsa on this vacation. She has the same English name as my daughter, and we are very lucky. Thank you for her careful answers and meticulous service. Thank you also to the manager Mr. Patrick, his gentleman service and interaction with the children are really great! There are also service staff who help us clean the room, and staff who carefully disinfect the bathtub. At the same time, I would like to thank the staff of the Western restaurant and the driver of the battery car in the hotel for their meticulous and patient service!
I believe that I will choose Naked Ridge again and come to this place full of beauty, relaxation and happiness again. I can't wait to look forward to the next trip to Naked Ridge!

Thanks to the housekeeper Molly at naked Ridge for taking good care of us throughout the entire stay and also applying for a room upgrade for us. I was lucky enough to stay in a single-family villa. The room was spacious and bright, and the design and decoration were unique. My family and I liked the living space in the room very much. Except for the bathroom on the second floor, which is not very friendly to the elderly, everything else was great!
The food at Naked Ridge is a major feature here, with a rich breakfast variety and steak during the Spring Festival. Chinese dim sum, freshly cooked vermicelli soup noodles, and Western cakes are all available.
We had two meals at Lingshangge Chinese Restaurant during our stay. We recommend the Jinling salted duck, Xiangyou eel paste, Huaiyang spring cakes, and the fish soup from Wuxiangshan Reservoir. The chef is very skilled. Good, the price-performance ratio is also OK, the family is very satisfied with the meal.

The children were happy to run in and out of the two courtyards! We experienced the hotel's animal feeding and archery projects, which were pretty good! With the good weather, it also added a lot to the overall feeling.
Service: Speaking of service, I really appreciate the attentiveness of our housekeeper Molly. Seeing that it was my father's birthday, she took the initiative to arrange a cake for us. I love you! ~ My children also like the beautiful Aunt Molly. After leaving, they asked if they could play with Auntie. I wanted to take the shuttle bus driven by Auntie!
Finally, I would like to make a small suggestion. The room is generally good, but I was really surprised that there were "visitors" on my curtains for two consecutive nights. Can I strengthen the insect repellent when I turn the bed at night? Also, I am more concerned about the water stains on the bathroom glass. I thought I would wipe it when cleaning, but it stayed there until I left!
In general, the experience is good and I will consider coming again! Looking forward to the next trip!

Because the place is large, there are not many tourists, and there are no crowds, so children can run freely here, and adults can lie down beside them and be in a daze. As soon as they got home, they began to regret that they should stay for two more days. We have made an appoin**ent with my family that we will come here again when spring comes.

msg:It was our first time to stay at Naked Ridge Resort, and we made a temporary decision and booked it for a day. However, we didn’t expect it to be an unexpected surprise when we arrived, so we extended our stay for another day. First of all, after booking the hotel, the housekeeper will contact us immediately. Inform various hotel information, and there will be a shuttle bus to the hotel parking lot to take you to the front desk for check-in. This stay happened to be during the Spring Festival, and there were many activities to participate in, including an indoor fun factory, outdoor archery, horse feeding, and amusement parks. As for the scenery, although it is winter and there are no flowers or anything, even the dead trees are very beautiful. The architecture of the house is very particular, and the overall feeling is like the Jiangnan style of the Song Dynasty, but the interior is very warm, and the facilities are also very advanced and modern, including heating. It's very comfortable. I originally thought that this kind of building would make the house colder, but I ended up worrying too much. It's so warm that I even want to turn on the air conditioner~ So there's no need to be afraid of the cold in winter. In addition, let’s talk about the service attitude. The butler who served us these two days is Liro. He is a very gentleman and warm-hearted butler. He will respond to any request as soon as possible. His attitude is very friendly. It is very pleasant to communicate with us in the past two days. It really makes the guests happy. Experience the hotel service of "feeling at home"~ There are also other waiters, every smile of the front desk staff, every cup of hot tea, the shuttle bus guy, the guy at the archery venue, the gate security guy~ everyone of them has it The very good service attitude made us feel that this trip was really worth it. No one showed any impatience because they had to go to work during the Spring Festival, so I really appreciate naked Ridge's service attitude! So this trip, although I decided to come to Naked Ridge on the spur of the moment, with half expectations and half doubts, by the time I entered the hotel parking lot, I no longer had half doubts. It was all a surprise. I had a great Valentine's Day. Happy and heart-warming. In the new year and the new journey, I wish Naked Ridge Resort will get better and better! I will definitely come back with my family for the second time~

Environment: The room is very big. Because I was traveling as a family, I liked their two large beds. One of them is like a tatami, so a family of three can have two large beds, which is very comfortable.
Service: Let me focus on service. I used to go out and stay in some relatively high-end hotels and B&Bs. In basic resorts or B&Bs, there would be a butler who would add me on WeChat and provide any needs. But the housekeeper of this hotel is very serious, careful and responsible. He called me in two days ago, reminded me of the weather and roads, and even turned on the air conditioner for us before going. The butler's name was Liro, and he also arranged free snacks and children's breakfast for us. Later, because of the rain, there was basically no outdoor play. When the manager on duty the next day, Ricky, drove the shuttle bus over, he also gave us small gifts and snacks. His attitude was very friendly.
Having stayed in so many hotels, the service at Nanjing Naked Ridge Resort is really good! 👍🏻
The food in the Chinese restaurant inside also tastes good, except that it is a little expensive, there is nothing wrong with it. Recommended this resort to friends.

Sitting on more than 300 acres of land on Wuxiang Mountain, naked Ridge has the largest area among the brands, making it sufficient to provide mental health and wellness. Integrate various needs of natural parent-child entertainment. In early winter, when we saw the tourists gathering on Wuxiang Mountain to see the Tianchi Lake and the red pond cedar forest, we casually hiked up the mountain from the hotel, and suddenly realized that we were living in the scenic spot, and we felt full of happiness.
What further enhances happiness is our personal butler Molly. The beautiful lady has a strong sense of initiative and service. She provided us with detailed travel tips and hotel project information before and after our stay. She was always responsive to our requests and answered all our questions during our stay, which gave us an excellent hotel experience.
I remember that when we drove to the hotel gate, the security checked the license plate and let us go immediately. We parked the car in the parking lot. Molly was already waiting in the electric car. We took our luggage and went directly to the lobby to check in. Then we continued to take the car directly to the room. The whole process was efficient and smooth. Needless to say, together with the rooms and courtyards that surprised us, the wonderful experience brought by such hardware + software + environment is an intuitive reflection of naked Ridge's five-star rating, which is impressive.
Thumbs up again Molly, looking forward to visiting Naked Ridge again.

In three days and two nights, we basically visited every corner of the resort. Hygiene is a must for a hotel at this price. I won’t go into more details. What’s worth mentioning is the heart-warming service.
For example, when roasting marshmallows at the campfire on the first night, the staff found that the child was a little afraid of being too hot if he was too close, so the staff thought of tearing off the cardboard to cover him.
In addition, the resort also has a lot of activities, including cycling, rock painting, pumpkin carving, archery, feeding, and hiking. You can stay in Wuxiang Mountain for a few days.
It would be perfect if it was closer to Shanghai! ! !

A few things that impressed me: 1. The hotel service is very good, from the butler to the restaurant, everyone is kind and professional. 2. The ecology is very suitable for walking children. 3. The front desk paid to upgrade to a luxurious mountain courtyard with large rooms and high-end facilities. Overall very user-friendly. The experience of two days and one night was very relaxing and comfortable.
At first, when I was told that there was a butler, I thought it was rather stylized and I didn’t pay much attention to it. Even when connecting online, I didn’t feel anything special. But I didn't expect that after actually interacting with me in the hotel, the professional and warm service provided by the housekeeper really added a lot to the whole trip. Thank you Icey for her appropriateness and thoughtfulness. Because we had a baby with us, blankets were specially prepared for us because of the big temperature difference between day and night in the mountains. The baby also had a special liking for Icey. The hotel has undergone several adjus**ents from planning to completion and operation. Icey is very familiar with some design details and concepts, which also made our experience more three-dimensional and rich.
Special thanks to the Western Restaurant. Because we decided to go there for a meal at short notice and did not prepare a meal for the baby, the Western Restaurant produced a baby meal based on our idea of ​​no seasoning. Thank you very much.
The room comes with a large courtyard, advanced facilities, enough space for three adults and one child, and floor heating.
The hotel has a lot of activities, and the free-range animals have a style of their own.

The hotel is located in the embrace of Wuxiang Mountain, surrounded by tranquility and beauty, as if it is a paradise. In this beautiful place, you can see green mountains and green waters, vast lawns, cultivated farmland, leisurely strolling goats and alpacas, and children's favorite indoor and outdoor children's playgrounds.

This time I stayed in a small courtyard in the mountains. The room is fully equipped, spacious and bright, and provides a huge tatami that can be used as another comfortable bed. What I like most is the cozy little yard. There, I can leisurely admire the red leaves on the mountains in the distance, completely relaxing my mind. All this makes me feel extremely happy.

Before our journey began, the hotel had arranged for a butler to meet us in advance. The housekeeper Molly arranged our itinerary in detail in the group. From the moment we arrived in the hotel parking lot, we felt her warmth and attentiveness. During our vacation, our needs were responded to in a positive, professional and welcoming manner.

The quality of the hotel's Chinese restaurant is very good, and the Huaiyang cuisine tastes authentic, especially the shredded eel, which is worth trying.

The three-day and two-night trip allowed us to appreciate the beauty of nature and we are looking forward to our next trip.

msg:Seizing the tail end of autumn, take Mr. Gu and Tang Minnie to check out the naked series of Nanjing Naked Ridge Resort for the first time.
      I especially like the butler-style service. The butler has been very considerate in answering all kinds of questions before checking in. I always felt that the butler should be a girl. It was only after checking in that the true face of Lushan was revealed. Steven turned out to be a little brother🤭
      The hotel is operated with a green and environmentally friendly concept. The environmental layout and hardware facilities are quite original. Ginger tea, apple hawthorn tea and handmade biscuits are available at the front desk to give guests a warm welcome and greetings. The large lawn has many service and entertainment facilities for guests to relax.
      When you open the room, you first see a large tatami. What's even more surprising is that the shower room actually has floor heating. Many details of the hotel are very thoughtful. The hotel's western restaurant has a very distinctive appearance, but the restaurant is not big and there are not many breakfast varieties, but the overall taste is OK. I have a few suggestions that the hotel can refer to: 1. Although winter has not yet officially entered, the cool toilet seat is a little lacking. Is it possible to be as considerate as floor heating and install a washlet? 2. The room is not small, but there are only two trash cans in the whole room. Is it possible to add an extra trash can next to the sink? It is really inconvenient to throw the garbage in the toilet trash can every time.

msg:We have been to naked Castle and naked valley before. For our seventh wedding anniversary, we chose naked Castle, which we have never been to before. It was the wisest decision for us. We were really satisfied with this trip!
Because I was bringing my parents and baby with me, I was really worried that improper arrangements would make them uncomfortable and dissatisfied, but I really want to praise our butler Liro! He made our vacation very memorable
We had already added WeChat to communicate before departure, and I felt his attentiveness and thoughtfulness before heading to the hotel. I told him early in the morning that the baby needed a nap, and he helped us prepare everything early. Stepping into the hotel lobby, several staff members greeted us warmly, which made the fatigue of the journey disappear. The butler Liro patiently introduced us to the hotel, room facilities, etc. During our three-day and two-night stay, as long as we had He will respond quickly and help us solve any problems. It is really very reassuring. I think the best experience of staying in a hotel comes not only from the beautiful scenery or good facilities, but also from what I care about most. , and what we can feel most is good service, and the most important thing about good service is the attentiveness, sincerity and smile of each service staff. Liro, as our closest service staff these days, is impeccable! The other service staff in the hotel are also very nice. Although I can't name them, I really want to give Naked Ridge a thumbs up! I highly recommend everyone to come! I’m also looking forward to visiting Naked Ridge again soon!
In addition, Naked Ridge’s souvenir, I call it a small breast cup, is really cute. I didn’t get the blue and cream colors I like in the blind box, which is a pity!

msg:The pre-sale price was beautiful. When traveling with friends, they chose a luxurious mountain courtyard with a large courtyard. It was cool in early autumn, and after repelling mosquitoes, there were basically no mosquitoes. Listening to the chirping of insects, we just drank tea and snacks under the pavilion and kept chatting. We talked so much that we forgot to visit the nearby small animal house on the way here. I did see several free-range bleats.
It takes half an hour to take a taxi from Lishui and one hour to the south from Nanjing. Except for those with reservations, drivers are generally reluctant to enter the mountains. The security guard at the door was very nice and taught us how to get a taxi smoothly. The housekeeper Icey/steven was also very responsible, answering all questions, turning on the air conditioner in advance, and getting multiple beddings for room service very quickly.
The dinner at Lingshang Pavilion was more delicious than expected. I recommend the Huaiyang fried shredded eel. It’s a bit difficult to take a walk after dinner, as some sections of the road need to be strengthened with street lights and signs.

The owner is a large state-owned enterprise, so it can be seen that he is willing to invest in decoration. The natural environment is also very good. The service is very attentive. I praise the housekeeper, Miss Molly. We also hired a guide to take us on a hike to Wuxiang Mountain. The difficulty and exhaustion of the hiking route were just right. Thanks to the handsome guide Ben, both adults and children were very happy.
To add some nonsense, the sheep in this hotel are particularly powerful. According to Ben, one sheep has a crush on the female alpaca and firmly believes that the little alpaca is its baby. No wonder when a group of us tried to feed the alpacas, the sheep rushed down the hillside and drove us away.
Hope to come and play again next time.

For high-speed rail travel, transfer to the high-speed rail from Nanjing South to Lishui, then take a taxi into the mountains. The shuttle bus is waiting in the parking lot, and the connection is smooth. Molly said that we were the earliest arriving guests she had ever received, and she still helped me arrange early check-in. The courtyard and rooms are well-equipped as the name suggests. The tatami can accommodate two children, making it easy for a family of four to stay. The bed is very comfortable, and I got the highest deep sleep score tested by Huawei. There is a buffet for breakfast, with a rich variety of Chinese and Western styles. Room service is available. I squeezed in some time to go to the naked leaf spa. The environment was elegant and relaxing, and the service was standardized. The entire resort was being renovated. In the morning, I casually mentioned to Molly that the renovations next door were too noisy, and she offered to skip breakfast for us, which was a great surprise. When you meet the staff on the road, they will greet you warmly. It feels like a vacation in Bali. It can be seen that naked Ridge is trying to do better. A few suggestions: 1. It is difficult for non-self-driving guests to call a taxi. I hope that the shuttle bus can go to the bottom of the mountain to pick up and drop off; 2. The automatic positioning needs to be more accurate. Calling a taxi in the morning will locate it at another hilltop; 3. The restaurant provides a variety of set meals. Advance reservations available. 4. There are no flowers or fruits in this season, and it is not lively enough. Find some cute plants and add them. However, Fendai will be released as a film in a few days. All in all, I will come to the sisters gathering again if I have the chance.

msg:In the hot summer, I lived in Naked Ridge with my baby and 80+ parents for two days. The overall feeling is very good, and the elderly have a good time. A few things stand out:
1. The resort is located in a large area in Wuxiang Mountain. Various houses are integrated with the landscape and terrain, which is very natural and also has a sense of design. We booked the mountain courtyard and the forest hut at the same time, and we prefer the mountain courtyard
2. Although it is the peak summer tourist season, there are fewer guests than expected, and the whole resort is very clean. Whether it is a golf course, lawn or a pet park, you can enjoy a private corner wherever you go
3. The green ecology in the village is very good, there are small scenes everywhere, the small animals are clean, and the alpacas are free to graze outside during the day. Accompanied by the sound of cicadas, it is the beautiful appearance of summer
4. The butler team Molly/Ricky is very friendly and responds in a timely manner, leaving a good impression on my parents. The buffet breakfast is small and beautiful, with a complete variety and good taste. Chinese food is also good, but the price is more expensive
5. It is very close to Wuxiang Temple, about 900 meters away from the residential area. But in the past, I found out that Wuxiang Temple had been temporarily closed in July, leaving a little regret.

msg:I have always been looking forward to the naked Heart series. I went to naked Stables Valley more than ten years ago and was very impressed. The main reason for choosing naked Ridge during the May Day holiday is the small number of people, comfortable facilities, parent-child environment, and small animals. All these needs are met here. You don’t need to go out after entering the hotel, and you can easily spend 2-3 days. It's just that the food and service are slightly inferior, and I have met the butler from the beginning to the end.
In addition, driving to Shanghai normally takes three and a half to four hours, and there is a traffic jam of five hours on holidays, so children's acceptance must be fully considered.

I especially praise Liro and Molly. If you encounter problems during your stay, you can help them solve them as soon as possible. The attitude of other hotel staff is also very good. Very friendly.
This time I stayed in a mountain hut. The overall facilities of the room are average, which does not match the price of more than 2,000 yuan. The sanitation is also average. The coffee machine is good.
The tent camping area can be booked in advance, it is free, and it is good to sit and drink in the afternoon and play football with the baby. The hotel is suitable for parents and children. Children like the outdoor rides, and there are small animals to feed. There are bonfires at night, roasting marshmallow corn and so on.
The Chinese restaurant tastes good, but the price is a little expensive. The breakfast is okay, and there are not many varieties.
Overall, the environment of the hotel is still very beautiful, suitable for playing with children in spring

It must be mentioned here that Ctrip has enjoyed the butler service. During the winter vacation, the naked Stable Valley booked in the official applet does not have the butler service, and the various services are much different from naked Ridge, although there are not so many activities in naked Ridge. , the scenery is relatively ordinary, but seeing some planning in the later stage, it should get better and better in the future. for various activities. The room is very large, two adults and two children can easily stay, and the big tatami can also sleep two adults. It's relatively quiet at night, and it happened that the one who stayed was not next to the bedroom, so it was not affected by the next room. The yard is large and lush with greenery. There are many lawn activities, outdoor facilities are very popular, there are many kinds of pet parks, and there are scattered sheep and alpacas. Children who live in free-range animals should be careful when feeding them, as they will run up once they take out food. There is also a ferocious black swan with a strong sense of territory. After landing on the shore, it walks super fast. If children are playing on the lawn, if they see that they don’t come forward to tease and feed, they will directly jump up and bite~ Stayed for two nights and also experienced the spa. The price And the service can match, super relaxing. For meals, there are not many dishes in Chinese restaurants and Western restaurants. I think it is a lot less than Naked Stables, but the taste is good~ The barbecue buffet during Labor Day is very cost-effective. It is recommended to use it. The quality of the crayfish is very good, and the barbecue is also good. Unlimited beer, other Chinese and Western dishes are also good, there are fruits and soups, there is no charge for children under 6 years old, and there is a 10% discount if you book in advance. It is outdoor dining on the roof garden. It is a little cold at night and you need to wear thicker clothes. The overall evaluation is still good~

It just so happened that the kid's toy was broken, so he asked the butler cheekily for a screwdriver, and he even helped to find it. It's like Doraemon! ! ! Moreover, the natural scenery of the hotels in the scenic area is very good. What's more, compared with other resort hotels, it takes 15 minutes to get to Wanda, which is really an advantage. It's a good place to find a quiet place amidst the hustle and bustle! Definitely come again next time!

Although the swimming pool is still a little too cold to use, (after another month, you will definitely be able to lie in the pool in the afternoon) the hot water in the pool is enough for the two of us to use the outdoor hot spring at night and the children to play during the day. The kitchen has microwave, oven, dishwasher, coffee machine, pots, bowls, knives, forks, chopsticks, and refrigerator. If you are interested in cooking, it is OK. There is also a barbecue pit in the yard, and I ate two diy bbq meals, which was refreshing. Alpacas and lambs are all free-range, and children are fed at close range, which is too rare in the city. The naked heart flavor here is in line with the naked heart flavor of naked Stable Valley in my memory. It is delicious and fresh ingredients grown in the local gardens; the Chinese restaurant is launching seasonal dishes in spring, such as toon tofu, shepherd's purse spring rolls, pickled fresh... Fresh and delicious. The hiking route is a bit difficult to find, but the route map or signs along the way can be optimized. The service of the whole hotel has always been intimate and cordial. Thanks to the butler Daniel for his full service. Of course, the telephone customer service center also provides various efficient solutions. There are 2 small suggestions. The faucet of the washbasin in the bathroom is too close to the edge of the basin, which is not so convenient to use; the curtain of the window in the bathroom transmits light from the yard or the villa next door. If you don’t pay attention to it, privacy may not be guaranteed. It is recommended to do the same with the curtain some improvements. Next time I will try a villa with more bedrooms! Thank you!

msg:I have stayed at naked Stables Valley in Suzhou, and it feels pretty good. This time I took my family to naked Ridge to experience it.
The hotel is relatively new, and the trees have not yet grown into forests. It may be much better in a few years.
The hotel has a wild and luxurious design, has its own cute pet center, and the room is big enough to sleep on. It is very good to take children crazy. I booked a three-bedroom pool villa this time, and it feels passable, but there are not many surprises. There are a few feelings: First, it is very unfriendly to the elderly. The roads in the rocky area are all deep and shallow. This is not a real shortcoming, but a problem with the design concept. It can only be said that those who take care of the elderly should try to avoid it. Second, the kitchen is very large and well-equipped. It is strange that there is no seasoning or salt. We still asked the kitchen for it. Third, the outdoor barbecue area. I have been looking for a light switch for a long time but I can't find it. I just called it. Knowing to open a secret door in the living room wall was weird and troublesome; fourth, the stove in the BBQ area was nice, but, filthy! I also called the waiter to clean it, and then cleaned it myself; fifth, the temperature of the bathing pool was not adjusted in advance, and the master was invited to adjust it, but it went straight to 49 degrees at night, wasting a whole night; sixth, the temperature in the room The air-conditioning panel couldn't be dimmed, it was too bright to dazzle, but finally put a sanitary napkin on it, even if it was better, it couldn't completely solve the problem. Attention those who are sensitive to sleep light.
Well, the first and sixth are hardware issues, especially the first, there is not much room for improvement. The other few items are basically management issues, and I look forward to a big improvement next time I go.

msg:Because I was going to participate in the marathon, I searched for hotels in Lishui, and finally chose Naked Ridge. It really lived up to my expectations. The food and beverages in the room must be nothing to say. I would like to praise the butler team, Daniel/Emmitt/Liro, they are really caring , care is in place, service is thoughtful, I will go again next time! A little comment, the rapeseed flowers and other flowers outside are in full bloom, and the hotel's flowers would be perfect if they are more beautiful!

It is enough for him to be happy. He has to feed the small animals several times a day. On the way back, he is very happy I said that I would like to go to the swimming pool after the summer vacation. I would like to thank Daniel/Emmitt/Sophia. I am picky and troublesome, but they are really nice and patient. The breakfast and dinner are delicious and the quantity is very large. In short, it was a very good time happy trip~

It seemed to be the off-season when I went there on Thursday, and there were not many people there. Breakfast and dinner were all available. It’s the same as my girlfriend’s private room, haha, but the service is very good, the housekeeper Molly is warm and caring, and the steak in the restaurant is also delicious, I will come again if I have the opportunity. .

The room is very big, the decoration style is the one I really like, clean and comfortable, the room service is also very warm and considerate, the room is very warm, and there is a super big yard, you can see many stars at night, very romantic🌹. The overall internal and external environment of the hotel is very good, with fresh air and a kind of solemn beauty. There are many activities in the outdoor playground. The pet park can be fed with rabbits 🐰, alpacas 🦙, and horses 🐎 at close range. The baby likes it very much. I went to feed it again before leaving the store. In short, every service staff is very enthusiastic and proactive👍. In particular, Wang Xiaotian at the front desk was thoughtful and meticulous in her service during check-in, especially the smile on her face, which made people feel very warm. When checking out, the head office supervisor also gave a small gift, which was a pleasant surprise✨. It was a great staying experience, very suitable for family outings, worth coming again! Thanks again to the staff in various positions in the hotel, I wish you a happy new year and smooth work!

People are quiet and the kites are happy, and outside the small bridge, there are fresh green splashes." It is the beauty of Wuxiang Mountain in Lishui, Nanjing. Naked Heart Ridge Resort is located in the Wuxiang Mountain National Forest Park. As a member of the "Naked Heart Resort", the site selection can be described as particular. Surrounded by mountains and rivers, the air is fresh and the environment is excellent. This time we stayed in the mountain courtyard, which is a unique, natural and rustic log cabin. The room was comfortable and well equipped. Here you can walk or ride in the mountains, forests, and fields, full of wild fun, and enjoy the fun of nature. Children prefer to have some close contact with animals. Such a wonderful time would like to stay for a while longer. The service at Naked Heart Ridge is great. The whole butler service makes you feel at home. Our butler is called Liro, and he feels very kind. Liro is very dedicated to his work, patiently introduced, and the service is very good, which is very good.

1. The room has a slight smell, maybe it's because we live downstairs, and the sewer pipes haven't been dealt with very well.

Even during the epidemic, the price of naked Ridge was not low, but its overall beauty An orderly natural environment (you can see that many peach trees have been newly planted), the a**osphere of the public area (especially the log building in the breakfast room is very grand), and a complete system of children's facilities (the children like to play and shoot arrows and feed alpacas ), and the spacious rooms (designed but comfortable and natural) made of logs and rustic, all make people feel that they are worth the price. Walking around casually, you can feel the comfortable and natural planning everywhere, which is different from other places. Name the handsome butler Emmit, who is absolutely responsive and makes people feel at home. The staff in restaurants and other places are relatively young and eye-catching, and the service is meticulous and satisfactory.

msg:I’m still looking forward to the naked series of hotels (this is the previous chapter) 1: Ctrip’s price is actually 400 more expensive than its own official website. I want to cancel and buy again, but Ctrip communicates with the hotel and refuses to agree, even if you are positive I need a positive report from the hospital, which means I have to go. It’s only an hour’s drive from Nanjing~ 2: Because of the epidemic, there are only two or three rooms in the hotel that are occupied, and it’s -6℃ in the winter in the mountains. Come here The connected battery car is designed to let you experience the feeling of open-top driving even though it clearly has a windshield zipper. The battery guy completely ignored your question ~ Three: The service level of the hotel’s front desk registration room butler is pale, why did Dior choose your home? The conference was really breathtaking... (I thought I could get an upgraded room when there was no business, but I overestimated Naked Ridge.) Four: The room looks good from the outside, but the facilities inside are not as good as a B&B or minibar. They actually charge money, more than 2,000 yuan per night. The floor heating in the room is only available in the bathroom at the door. The headboard of the bed is so cold that it's really exciting. What brand are the bathrooms in? The hair dryer is standard for an express hotel. How come the hair dryer is built on the mountain? **Xiaohongshu casually advertises it? It's so ugly. In the end, the breakfast order was very sloppy and simple. There wasn't even a pretentious souvenir for check-out. Finally, we went to see a few alpacas and horses. It was still an open-top battery car. Anyway, the hotel was freezing. It doesn’t matter, I really, really, really don’t recommend going, it’s really, really, really not worth going, just open more roads and get out of town...

A few days before check-in, the housekeeper Icey added me on WeChat to learn about my travel method and remind me of the local check-in conditions in Nanjing. Now the policy is two inspections in three days (ie, landing inspection + second inspection after 12 hours)
The hotel is located on the mountain, the air is fresh and suitable for lung washing, and the decoration is mainly log wind. The hotel is more like a large resort, with animal feeding (sheep, lop-eared rabbit, alpaca, horse, little pig, peacock), archery range & outdoor 3 large children's playground & road for the brave, in addition to a There is a large lawn, sometimes the most popular Frisbee court, as well as football and volleyball, as well as modeling⛺️, the posing is excellent!
In such a big place, the shuttle bus to and from each point depends on the hotel. A WeChat message is sent to the housekeeper, and the bus will come soon. If it rains, the driver will pick him up at the door of the room with an umbrella. The service attitude is really good. Very very good👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Another very important point is to dine, because the hotel is on the mountain, so don’t expect takeout, but fortunately, the dishes in the Chinese restaurant are all delicious. Before leaving, I didn’t forget to pack a Nanjing special salted duck. As shown in the picture, if you live for more than two days, it is recommended to go down the mountain to find something to eat.

The butler service in the service after four days has not been enjoyed, and no one has taken the initiative to contact us, but the overall staff service is very friendly;
The house is spacious, and the wooden kang-style rest area is equivalent to adding a 2-meter large bed;
The portion of the parent-child set meal offered in the Chinese restaurant is too small, and I have added dishes myself, and there are fewer dishes to choose from, and the dishes in the western restaurant are quite satisfactory in taste;
Questions and suggestions:
1. Since it is a parent-child hotel, the facilities are mostly child-centered, and more children's supplies should be prepared, as well as bath products of the same positioning;
2. Although mosquitoes are essential for hotels in the mountains, it is quite scary to see caterpillars shaking out by the bed in the house
3. Butler service is a feature, it should be implemented in a timely and effective manner to avoid many questions becoming complaints

Overall review: Beautiful environment, friendly service, a weekend resort worth trying

However, because Nanjing school could not leave Ning 14 days before the school started, I finally gave up the trip to Anji. Due to the prevention and control of the epidemic, Banyan Tree Nanjing Garden Expo Park has also stayed several times, and I feel that there is still a certain gap between the star service and catering of Banyan Tree in my mind. For comparison on Ctrip, I dared to choose Nanjing naked Ridge, which opened soon.
       An inadvertent choice has indeed brought a perfect experience to our whole family.
       The location of the hotel is really good, with mountains and water, natural oxygen bar; there are butler service with a smile in place, delicious Western and Chinese food; there are colorful entertainment activities (picking, feeding small animals, swimming, various activity equipment, etc. ), bring the children to play, the experience is full. If spring comes, it will definitely be a sea of flowers.
       Especially this time I can eat very authentic Western food, whether it is Western food or Chinese food, it is full of color, fragrance, and it is worth recommending to friends! The naked head chef can definitely reach the Michelin level. The hotel's service is in place, very considerate, and has a kind of intimacy at home! Give you a 5 star review!

The sunset was amazing, and it rained a little later, and it was cool to play in the swimming pool. Although there are many insects, there are no mosquito bites, which is really a surprise!
The layout of the entire hotel is reasonable, and the various functional areas of leisure, entertainment, and dining are not far from each other. Because of time constraints, I only tried the dinner in the Chinese restaurant and the buffet breakfast in the western restaurant. The taste is very good!
Any staff member we met in the hotel was very enthusiastic, courteous, patient and meticulous, answering questions, courteous, and not ignorant of picking up money, which satisfied us the most. If it is said that the hardware facilities of the hotel can be scored 8.5 points, the software services can be scored 9.5 points!
As for the hardware, the points are deducted because there may be some problems with the sewer pipes in the bathroom. If you don't take a bath for a long time or use the toilet, you will smell bad.
However, the overall feeling of the hotel is still very good, and I hope to make persistent efforts and continue to improve!

msg:For a weekend vacation, I brought the old and the young to live in the mountains for two days. The service is very good. If you don't want to walk, you can ask the hotel to use a battery car to pick you up. In fact, I didn't walk very far, but the weather was too hot. It is suggested that the hotel can build a greenway in the later stage, and use corridors or tree-lined walks to connect various points in series, so that you will not be afraid to walk on rainy or hot days. The forest hut I live in is good in all aspects, but there is a small area that can be improved: it is recommended to install handrails in the shower room to facilitate the elderly to take a bath. At present, the floor tiles are not slippery, but it is also necessary to consider that the elderly need strong handrails for bathing safety. In addition, the door preferably has a safety lock. Also, living in Ginkgo 1, the door to the terrace can't be locked after it has been opened, and I'm worried about potential safety hazards. In terms of eating, the vegetables in the Chinese restaurant are very fresh. In general, all aspects are ok. Next time I will come in a different season. The mountains are not as cool as I imagined. The hotel is relatively large and there are many outdoor places. The waiters have a heavy pick-up and drop-off task, and their attitudes are very good. It's hard work, thank you!

The staff are very friendly, especially the housekeeper Emmitt, who has contacted the elderly and made arrangements before moving in, and the security guard Wen Kaihan, sees the guest going out to climb the mountain, and takes the initiative to leave WeChat and give directions, so that the guest can feel the cordial service. The scenery of Wuxiang Mountain is very good, and the hotel is also very good, which is in line with the hotel brand positioning of naked Group.

msg:It has been heard for a long time that naked Group has opened a new naked Ridge Resort in Wuxiang Mountain, Nanjing, so they temporarily decided to take their children to the naked Ridge Resort in Wuxiang Mountain, Nanjing. After booking the room on Ctrip, the hotel steward will contact you in advance to inform you of the check-in arrangements. Here I would like to thank the housekeeper Emmitt😊, the thoughtful service makes us feel at home, and the three meals a day are arranged to be delivered to the room on time and on time, which is really considerate. We chose the two-bedroom rock villa. The rooms are named after insects, with a rustic appearance, a fusion of rock and log styles, with design furniture and interior decoration, which makes people feel warm and comfortable, but full of mountain and forest fun. In addition to the private swimming pool in the villa, the park can also ride in the forest, fishing on the waterfront, fun archery, feeding cute pets, etc. It is the best choice for adults and children to vacation 🥰

The resort is not big, and most of the activities and entertainment facilities are outdoors. With two restaurants, the experience of weekend vacations is no problem. The two stayed in the forest hut. The cotton quality was very comfortable. Three meals were used in the hotel, and there were surprises. Of course, during the busy weekends, there was still good service, which was also a surprise. The housekeeper, Icey, is really warm and thoughtful. Tony, the food and beverage director, can really take care of the needs. Of course, the sincere solution of the front desk manager during the checkout is also very attentive. This is my first time staying at naked. As a domestic holiday brand hotel, I am looking forward to getting better and better.

The sofa in the living room on the first floor is super deep and super large, which can completely sleep a lot of people. The service staff are serious and responsible, and they can call out to repair the air conditioner in the middle of the night, but later found out that we accidentally turned it into heating.

I feel that all the staff are very friendly to the guests, which reflects the naked brand image. Although there are not many activities in the hotel, the small animals in the cute pet paradise are simply a paradise for feeding babies. The housekeeper introduced the habits and stories of all kinds of small animals. Before leaving, the lobby manager also gave Wa Xinyi a pink coffee cup. The resort is located on Wuxiang Mountain in Lishui, covering a large area, with lush trees and beautiful flowers everywhere. It is a good vacation to return to nature and experience nature in person.

msg:On the seventh day of the first ***** month, there was a heavy snowfall and I stayed at the naked Ridge Resort in Nanjing. The room can accommodate three people because there is a large sofa to lie down on and watch TV. It is very comfortable. The staff is very polite but the professionalism needs to be improved. We checked in at noon and in the afternoon informed us that we were going to the front desk to pay the room fee because we didn't see carefully when we checked in that we were a guest who paid at the store with Ctrip's credit guarantee, so we had to check in again and the guy at the front desk went to us. Assisted in paying by credit card in my room. I pushed the door and entered the house without permission when I was speaking in the room. Although I came to work, it was a very bad experience. I came in at nine o'clock the next morning. Among them, the three cleaning sisters One of the management staff said it was too early, please come back later. They said that because they live in the town, they can go home after cleaning at the foot of the mountain. I said this has nothing to do with our guests. Do we need to accommodate Because we were staying for two nights, so we didn't discuss this issue and let them in to clean the house and wait for us to go out to eat and have not finished cleaning. I think this is a fly in the ointment. It must be pointed out that the bar is not open and the staff in the small animal area has not been seen so I groped and experienced it all by myself. The next day, I saw the guests in the next room set off fireworks. I was very happy. The check-out process was smooth.

If you spend one or two million to stay in a hotel every year, you have no pattern, right? The slippers in the hotel are actually for public use. Don't talk about high-sounding environmental protection, it is personal after all, and you can afford it if you have athlete's foot and foot problems and spread it to others? In addition, the hygiene is a mess, I can't bear to look directly at it. After all, it is a homestay brand in principle. There is really no systematic management at all. The experience is very bad.

第一次入住裸心繫列，總體還是滿意的。
環境：裸心嶺建在無想山的山坳裏，羣山間一片開闊平坦的田園風光，令人心曠神怡。
住：開始安排的房間有黴味，提出後管家和經理立馬安排其他房間入住。房間的裝飾古樸而温暖，但是硬件設施相比較其他同價位酒店確實會差強人意些。
娛樂：活動安排非常豐富，在酒店呆兩天也不會覺得無聊。户外活動會更有意思， 特別是可以投喂放養的羊駝和黑臉羊，小朋友興奮得不得了。比較遺憾的是户外泳池改成了草坪，而水療中心的室內泳池又太小，比起泳池更接近泡池。
餐食：早餐不算豐富，但是品質在線。中餐廳的臭鱖魚非常推薦，但是中餐廳需另收10個點的服務費和6個點的税點，所以價格會略貴。
服務：我們的管家是Elsa,從入住前一天就聯繫我們各種安排，事無鉅細，非常貼心。Ben,似乎在哪塊娛樂場地都能找到他，非常非常nice,教我們射箭，羽毛球乒乓球陪練，甚至還教我們如何釣小龍蝦。還有一位非常親切的經理（沒有來得及記住名字），熱心及時的為我們協調房間。感謝裸心嶺的所有服務人員，讓我們一家老小都賓至如歸。

攜程919大促下單的產品，特意選了深秋來體驗南京的“秋日調色盤”。管家Icey提前兩天聯繫，添加了微信。事無鉅細，真正有被感動到。不管是安排餐食還是安排行程、叫車，都妥妥當當，事事有迴音。
入住期間遇到的所有員工都很熱情，中餐廳和西餐廳味道都很不錯。西餐廳的自助早餐非常贊。咖啡不是那種普通五星級酒店的咖啡口感，是外面咖啡店的出品水準，兩杯拿鐵喚醒活力滿滿的一天！
酒店環境很好，各種顏色的樹葉相映成趣。羊駝、黑山羊等都是散養的，在草坪上自由散步。
房間乾淨，山野小院亮點是巨大的榻榻米。
水療中心小童可以小遊🏊一下，出來的時候很冷，Icey接我們的時候還帶了一個露營風滿滿的大毛毯。把服務做到了細微處。
總體而言，非常喜歡。種草了裸心繫列。有機會再去莫幹山的裸心谷看看。

🍀房間管家小雪一直貼心服務，感覺就是打遊戲裏的金手指，有什麼問題馬上出現了😂
🍀酒店的早餐也很好吃，中餐廳的晚餐值得一試，推薦鹽水鴨！

酒店是寵物友好，單這點在我這就是加分項～感覺自己像在發佈得獎感言，把每個遇見的人都點一下，但是確實很棒！

msg:裸心繫列一直是酒店愛好者的心頭好。自從裸心嶺登陸南京，迫不及待地訓了一個美好的春日週末，帶着全家老小一起來體驗。

❤️房型：
推薦我們此次入住的房型-【山野小院】，空間大而舒適，泡池能無壓力塞下一家三口。mini bar軟飲免費。最美好的是獨家院落，桃樹結了青色的果子，孩子超級喜歡迴歸林田的生活。

❤️餐飲：
有裸心嶺·裸心味 和裸心嶺·嶺上閣中餐廳 兩個餐廳🍴都體驗了一下，更喜歡裸心嶺·裸心味 的早餐。餐廳的設計像一座拱橋，很有美感！

❤️娛樂：
孩子喜歡的動物樂園、無動力遊樂設施，還有隨地形變換的豐富景觀，兩天一夜完全可以不出酒店。羊羣是散養的，一大羣跑起來有點瑞士那味。

游泳池水温太低了些，好在有舒適的温水泡池，上午幾乎無人。

酒店的活動很豐富，推薦瑜伽🧘♀️、騎行等，在周邊的山裡還看到很多挖筍的遊客😋

❤️服務：
真貼心管家式服務，實名感謝Liro先生，讓我們有這麼愜意的假期。

msg:去裸心嶺因為在浙江和蘇州的連鎖店都去過，留下了很好的印象。所以到南京也去看一下，由於當天圓博園拍照晚了，最後到酒店已經很晚，一路上黑乎乎的還有點嚇人，還冷的不行，還好管家把房間的空調開了。然後急急忙忙去餐廳吃飯，吃到了最美味的飯菜，簡單而美味無比，把一點點小怨氣消失的無影無蹤。房間是小別墅的那種，有院子。不過鄉林園趣有點小失望，雜亂的草和沒有經過設計過的樹，沒有一點層次和區分。房間的浴缸是陳舊了？還是沒有洗乾淨？坐便器還有小便的影子？這個環境沒有辦法和裸心堡，裸心谷，裸心水相比。不過餐飲做的比園博園好很多，每道菜的味道都不錯，早上的鴨血粉絲湯比園博園的好吃很多。所以酒店有許多需要改善的地方。

酒店設施還是比較全的，室外小童樂園難度有點高，別問我是怎麼知道的。。。小動物們很可愛，有幾塊荒地感覺應該還在修，期待以後會更美。西餐廳像一個廊橋，很有特色，早餐非週末的半自助感覺很有品質。
周邊的話無想山沒有開發的太好，中午帶着野餐包去無想寺水庫野餐還不錯，感覺都是當地人。無想古寺還在修繕中，有一個步道，其他就沒啥了。山下的無想水鎮很冷清，有點可惜了，有個萬達可以吃飯看電影。

服務無可挑剔，無論是管家Liro/Molly，前台，接駁車小哥，草坪外場工作人員，客房還是餐廳，都很好
最感人的是，五一滿房，也不擁擠……可能還是因為場地夠大，大家分散在不同角落，各取所需

小朋友玩無動力，餵動物（散養的天鵝，羊駝，小羊）……還有才出生的小馬駒“五一”
大人草坪踢球，風箏，飛盤，帳篷喝茶聊天

我們在酒店玩玩，又開車去了無想水鎮，去了郭莊農家樂，相當愉快

最後要誇一下活動中心的ben帥哥和中餐廳。ben向我介紹了酒店的羊和羊駝這兩個世家。讓我認識了“羊隊長”，一頭具有意思的羊，喜歡拋棄同類的夥伴，和羊駝混一起。你呼喚它，就會狗裏狗氣的跑過來，讓你薅它。説它醜居然還會朝你生氣！中餐廳的菜品正適合我家的口味，且物有所值，但建議部分菜品可以減量減價。

msg:臨時興起帶着🐶打卡第四家裸心，感謝管家Daniel和Emmitt的熱情招待。酒店本身設計的很美，櫻花大道桃花林寵物天地，後期維護嚴重欠缺，導致各個細節打理的很不到位。地面落葉沒有人打掃，河道里枯枝爛葉，雜草叢生，體驗感並不是很好。再不打理，夏天估計是要蚊蟲撲面了。酒店現在套餐價格確實很給力，包含的晚餐太驚喜了，裸心繫列的最低價格了。作為寵物友好酒店，按次收取清潔費也算是比其他酒店合理多了。希望管理團隊及時改進各方面後勤維護，下次去能見到不一樣的裸心嶺。

酒店活動超多，有適合小朋友的萌寵樂園、手工坊和室內外遊樂場，也有適合大朋友的騎行、徒步和spa。
當然，最出眾的還是酒店的服務。管家Emmitt在我們出行前就致電貼心提醒各種天氣情況和路況，到達酒店後也是有求必應。值得一提的是，小朋友晚上過敏腫成**，管家説夜黑山路難行，立刻安排人下山替我們買了葯送上來，萬分感謝。
都很棒！期待下一次見面。

周圍環境很不錯，空氣新鮮。
管家團隊Ricky / Emmitt有求必應。
訂的雙人晚餐，味道不錯。份量很足，我們兩大帶一個孩子，吃正好。
酒店裡小農場裏的小綿羊還在路上晃悠。
小童玩的地方也挺大的。以後還會考慮入住。

總之，是個不錯的度假酒店，值得待一兩天，但有些地方還有待改進

這幾天南京天氣不太好，趁機就帶着小朋友去了裸心嶺。預訂沒多久，就有前台小姐姐電話我告知各種細節，然後就是管家emmitt加了微信，全程隨時在線。贊一個，emmitt真是個帥氣又機靈的小哥哥。
非常適合帶小朋友玩，無動力樂園真的是小朋友的放電天堂，幹一個下午毫無鴨梨。萌寵樂園裡胡蘿蔔28一籃，我本來以為衹有一點點，好傢伙，上來的真的是噗噗滿，吊打南京其他幾個動物園。
中西餐廳都光顧了一下，實話實説，口味的話中規中矩，沒有差評，也沒有什麼太耀眼的。不過，也不影響裸心嶺的評分。
贊一個，可以二刷的地方，糾結的集美們，不要猶豫。沖，就對了。

msg:打卡的第四家裸心繫酒店，攜程預訂也有套餐可選，提前一天管家Emmitt來電確認日期和每天行程安排並提前報備車號。上海過來單程3個半小時，最後10公里的山路還是挺有趣的。百度導航終點略有偏移，好在大門口很醒目。辦好入住，樹屋對於兩人來説足夠了，如果帶一個娃也有睡的位置。套餐基本覆蓋了除入住日晚餐之外所有的餐食，還有不少活動可以參與，管家都會提前提醒和協助安排。其中山地車比較考驗體力。早餐的廊橋餐廳挺有特色，早餐搭配合理基本滿足不同口味的需求，午餐的套餐兩天的主菜分別是魚和雞，晚餐菜品走的算是精品路線，對兩個人來説應付2-3晚也是完全沒問題。酒店佔地面積挺大，內部大路小路都是連通的，喜歡自己溜達去各處轉轉。前台大廳旁邊就是游泳池，方方正正很大氣，再前方還有一個碩大的草坪，玩飛盤的絕佳場地。遇到的服務人員都熱情友善，是個安心度假的好去處

msg:跟太太用“攜程閨蜜套餐”體驗了該酒店，感想如下。
該酒店年初新開，經蜿蜒的山中道路可達大門，道路條件很好，雙向兩車道的柏油路。
一進酒店第一個問題，停車位太窄，作為新酒店應該考慮SUV大行其道的年代，不能弄到車門都不大好開。
這裏生意實在太好，停車場實際不小，停的滿滿當當，大門外都停了很多車。
借“套餐”感受了一些酒店的特色項目；
“無想山徒步”大約五公里，本身很有趣，但並非想象中組隊出發，而是根據手機上的電子地圖自行前往，需要經過“天池公園”的售票處，成人10元自付。
“閨蜜攝影”也絕非有攝影師跟拍，請自便，當然酒店中不乏美景。
射箭和寵物投喂中規中矩，不出意料。
西餐不錯，”牛柳“據服務員説”就沒見人點過“，不信邪點了真的不太好吃，不夠鮮美，感覺庫存蠻久，羊排不錯。
中餐人太多，”閨蜜套餐“的量不夠吃。
房間來説，內設略粗躁，馬桶沖水開關外殼一按就掉、體重秤沒有電池、三眼插座非常難插、空調兩晚跳閘兩次等，畢竟新開，需要磨合。
有過一些問題，總能得到很舒服的解決。
不吐不快的一點感想是，這家酒店的基層對企業似乎缺乏熱情，當然對客人尚算禮貌，但是你能感覺到他們有些怨氣。
畢竟活是一線人員做的，長期來説一定影響品質。
