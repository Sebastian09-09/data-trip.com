msg:This is a five-diamond hotel on Ctrip. This time, I feel that this is a hotel that can still do better. It's a hotel in an alley near the school. The alley looks quite open when you go in, and it's very quiet at night, which is a plus. The check-in at the hotel front desk is a bit chaotic. You need to queue up for check-in and check-out. There are four counters but only one is open for check-in. Moreover, when checking out at noon the next day, the hotel may be holding an event, so the room allocation is a bit chaotic, and many people are waiting in the lobby. In terms of hygiene, the ventilation effect of the hotel is okay, and the bedding in the room is relatively new, but there are still a lot of nail clippings on the carpet. I was a little frustrated and asked the front desk to vacuum the floor again. Later, I found hair on the bedside table and black glue on the shower head. I didn't ask the front desk for these. After a long journey, I silently used the plastic wrap I brought to wrap the remote control and other things, and then replaced the shower head with a replacement shower head I brought, and changed the water pipes. I brought my own blanket for the bedding. I still hope that the hygiene can be more meticulous in the future.

Not close to the commercial street and the road, in a secluded yard, it is very quiet at night, but in the morning there are children playing in the corridor early, and I can hear them clearly. The sound insulation of the door is average.
The hotel facilities are all necessary, but there is no icing on the cake. Compared with the same price, for example, a certain flower, it feels a little worse.
By the way, I want to complain about the hair dryer. The low-end feels like a hurricane!

The whole parking lot is dirty, and there is a strong decoration smell in the room, which is irritating to the eyes and nose.

msg:Advantages:
Environment and breakfast are excellent, in line with the positioning and psychological expectations.

Disadvantages:
Poor service quality!! Affects the experience and mood of the trip

1. I called the front desk to ask if I could send 3 bottles of water. The waiter asked if the voice could be louder. The tone and attitude were extremely bad. I wanted to give a bad review instantly. Can't you say it nicely?

After repeating it, the waiter said "I can't give 3 bottles. The standard is 2 bottles." It's outrageous. There are 2 of us staying here. If you give two bottles this time, won't you ask you again after drinking them? ? Is 1 bottle or 2 bottles of water worth a lot? ? ? ? The waiter hesitated for a few seconds and said okay.

2. Breakfast. After swiping the card, I entered the restaurant. In the middle of the meal, I went to make porridge (because I faced the wall when making porridge, and my back was to the waiter at this time). A waiter asked me twice behind me, "What's your room number?" I thought I was talking to the air. The third time, the waiter walked to my right and asked impatiently, "What's your room number?"

There are two unpleasant points: 1. Can't you call me sir? Who knows who you are talking to? ? No name at all, really irritating!!! And the tone was extremely impatient. 2. After I replied the room number, I asked "what's wrong", and the reply was ambiguous, something like "swipe the room card..." I didn't think clearly about what I wanted to say. I personally think it's funny to suspect that the customer didn't swipe the card for dinner...

It was a very bad hotel experience. I don't mean to generalize, but some details really affect people's mood. I hope to standardize the service quality of employees.

The room is quite large, the bed is soft and hard, the bathroom is separated into dry and wet areas, and the design is reasonable. I had dinner at the hotel in the evening. The supervisor was very good. He recommended Wuhan specialties, braised Wuchang fish, pork ribs and lotus root soup, and bacon fried red cabbage moss. They were very authentic and delicious. When he saw us drinking, he sent us a plate of fried peanuts. I was really touched. I will choose to come here next time I come to Wuhan and will recommend it to my friends.

msg:The location is right by the East Lake, with Wuhan University behind it. You must visit Wuhan University, and you can make an appoin**ent on site, but it doesn't seem to be too close to each gate.
The hotel is not very big, but fortunately it is relatively new, and it has its own courtyard and is very quiet. I have to praise the breakfast. Although there are not many varieties, it is very delicious (compared to the Westin where I stayed the day before), we stayed for two days and the breakfast was changed.
On the last day, the two of us went to the hotel's own restaurant for dinner. Because there were few people downstairs and the heating was not turned on, we were arranged to a super large private room on the second floor for more than a dozen people. We ordered three dishes, one of which was crispy pigeon. The quantity was large and delicious. The total cost was only about 200 yuan, which was very worthwhile. The key is that there was a dedicated waiter serving the two of us throughout the whole process. When she was not called, she was waiting in the small compar**ent. The service was not discounted at all, which was rare during the Spring Festival.

The check-in was not very pleasant. We arrived at around 11pm. The hot water was not working. The engineer came to check it out at night and said someone would come to deal with it later. After waiting for almost half an hour, no one came. The housekeeping office called the service center several times but couldn't get through. After 12pm, they said it was not working and they would open a room for you to take a shower and come back. It was a hassle. But fortunately, the hot water was normal the next day.
In addition, there may be too many people staying. The breakfast is average. Compared with 5-star hotels, it may be a bit reluctant. I gave a 4-point review considering that the hotel has not increased its price much.

The garden outside the hotel is unfinished, and the cabinets in the room are still covered with dust from the recent renovation. The glass door of the bathtub is not waterproof. The bath water keeps flowing out of the bathroom, but the water drain in the bathroom is blocked by renovation dust and the water cannot be drained. When I called the service desk, no one answered, and I was about to collapse. If you need to report it directly to the counter on the ground floor, the staff is helpful. The cleaners came quickly and cleaned the bathroom very politely and attentively. Half of your anger was gone immediately.
Since there was only one room card, I had to take it away when I went out. When I returned to the hotel at night, I found that the refrigerator was not cold and the fresh milk inside had gone bad. In fact, even if I took the room card, the refrigerator should not have a power outage.
Overall, the hotel has a stylish design, new room facilities, and a good breakfast. However, it may have to be opened before the National Day. There are some things that are not done well. I hope they can be improved soon. It should be a very high-quality hotel.
