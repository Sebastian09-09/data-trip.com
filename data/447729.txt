Whether it is the female security guard at check-in or the male security guard who helped us clean up the snow in the parking lot the next day, they are all very friendly and the front desk service is also good. Breakfast is basically a team meal, which is not friendly to individual guests. There is a problem with the air conditioning in the room. I caught a cold after being exposed to it all night. Overall a good hotel, I hope it can be improved to be even better.

The kitchen unloading truck occupies the spacious two-lane road in the middle to unload goods (it shouldn't occupy the garage lane to unload goods, and even if it does, it should only occupy one lane). In the middle of the two-lane road, they coordinated and communicated to give way, but refused to give way. They said they would wait until they finished unloading the goods, which was completely unreasonable. Not to mention blocking the driveway, according to hotel regulations, even elevator guests and staff give priority to guests. I have complained to the hotel and hope that the complaint will be valid and that the hotel's reputation will not be tarnished by the behavior of individual employees.

I repeated this several times. At around 4 a.m., I couldn’t bear to call customer service to ask for a thin quilt. I was told that it was already the thinnest, so I could only ask for two sheets and quilt covers to be removed and stacked on top of each other. I just fell asleep. The loudspeaker on the top of the corridor outside the door was playing English and Jazz very early in the morning. (I thought the guests next to me were playing music on their mobile phones with the door open.) In addition, the noise from the Northeastern guests' family made it impossible to fall asleep again.
I came back to the room at around 7 o'clock after a day of playing. The music in the hallway hadn't stopped yet. I called the customer service and told them whether it was turned off or turned down. I couldn't hear it in the room. I didn't sleep well last night and I was very tired after playing in the bright sun all day. There was an open-air karaoke session outside at around 8 o'clock. It was probably complained about being too quiet around 9 o'clock. It was over completely at 10 o'clock and I could sleep peacefully. A loud rumbling and resonant machine sound began to penetrate the random walls, which gave us headaches. (No exaggeration at all) After waiting for half an hour, we called the customer. We then went out to take a look. The sound from the security passage next to us was louder. The staff later told us that the air conditioners we stayed in were all outdoor units. We were unable to sleep and asked to change rooms. (Hotel From check-in to every employee I came into contact with, they were very nice and polite.) I moved to the other side of the second floor downstairs. There were people laughing, talking loudly, and making sounds of starting cars downstairs until 1:30. We slept peacefully. At about 6 o'clock the next morning, the uncle and aunt downstairs were pulling the trolley back and forth, chatting about where the food was and where it was cheap.
It costs more than 700 a night, but I don’t feel like I can have a good rest at a place that costs more than 100. It’s too difficult!

msg:I didn't feel that there were too many people when I checked in as an individual guest, but when I had breakfast, I realized that there were quite a lot of group travelers. The hotel is very close to the Tiansheng Sanqiao Scenic Area, and the surrounding restaurants are mainly for residents who want to escape the summer heat and are relatively affordable. Living on the fifth floor, the view is quite wide and you can see distant mountains. The swimming pool in the community is not open yet, the rooms are small, the hotel facilities are equivalent to domestic four-stars, and the sanitary conditions are good.

The service is poor and inadequate. You can't park your luggage in front of the hotel, which is extremely inconvenient. Very low cost performance, not recommended.
