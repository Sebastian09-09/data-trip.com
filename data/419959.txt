msg:A "Memorable" Birthday Night at Westin Hotel  
 
It was our first time to celebrate our birthday in this prestigious "five-star hotel".
We have been best friends since college, and because our birthday falls on the same day, it has been a tradition that we celebrate our birthday together.
This year we did not celebrate birthday with other friends because of Covid-19, but we still wanted to make it special and create a sweet memory out of the bitter days packed with choking workloads and perpetual Covid anxiety/fatigue.
We both agreed that it might be a good idea to spend the birthday at a luxury hotel, and we did some research work on the Internet in choosing the hotel a few days before our birthday. Finally we decided to stay at Westin Beijing Chaoyang, as we were impressed by the rating of the hotel-- 9.5 on agoda.com, 8.5 on ***********, 4.8 on Ctrip and 4.2 on Marriott.com. It is located in CBD, with walking distance to Sanlitun and Liangmaqiao. It seemd like a perfect place for night recreations.  
We checked in at the hotel on the afternoon of Sep. 11 with joyful mood, expecting that we gonna have a relaxing, loving and romantic night...
However, the hotel just failed us in so many ways that our birthday night turned out to be unpleasantly memorable...
1. ‚Äú‚Ä¶wine glasses that never came that night‚Ä¶‚Äù
We prepared a nice cake and a bottle of wine to the hotel.  We told the lady at the reception desk that we were here to celebrate our birthday. Not long after we got in the room, a uniformed boy came in with the fruit plate. We kindly asked the boy whether we could have two wine glasses, he replied he would go get them, but he never came back. We waited in the room around an hour but nothing showed up at the door. It was getting late and we decided to go out for dinner. We didn‚Äôt worry much at that time, since two wine glasses wouldn‚Äôt be too much a trouble for such kind of hotel.
We spent about 3 hours for birthday dinner in a nearby restaurant. With great pleasure and some exhaust, we went back to our Westin room. It was almost midnight and we were ready for the highlight of the night--the birthday countdown:  
the red-velvet cake was ready
the wine was ready
the camera was ready
the table was set and the right persons were ready....
Suddenly, we found that everything was ready except the WINE GLASSES...we received nothing from the uniformed boy at all!
We called the operator for help and were told that wine glasses were not available in the hotel. We couldn't believe such five-star hotel could not serve wine glasses! We called room service again. A few minutes later a self-called manager showed up at the door with two ordinary glasses, which, made us quite disappointed. We insisted on the wine glasses and the manager just informed us impatiently that wine glasses were only provided in the suite room...
We were so offended by his arrogance and condescending attitude. It seemed like guests staying in the double room don't deserve a pair of "wine glasses", which, according to the room service manager, is a privilege only for the guests in suite rooms. How ridiculousÔºÅLater, we were further annoyed by another call from the front desk trying to "explain" that they fell short of wine glasses these days and hoped we could understand‚Ä¶OLALA, what an incredible excuse from such "incredible" hotel!
We were picturing the romantic moment of the special BD night‚Äîa cozy room showered in the gentle candle light, creamy red-velvet cake, aromatic wine in the RIGHT glasses and the beautiful night scene out there‚Ä¶.the dreaming night was so spoiled by the fly in the ointment--wine glasses that never came that night‚Ä¶..
The next morning, we decided to try one last time for the wine glasses for the remaining wine. To our surprise, they came finally, but it was too late...
For more details of the story pls see the attached pics. ..

Hotel staff were able to communicate well in English especially the front desk considering it's my first time in Beijing, especially Scott and his colleagues who went the extra mile to make sure my questions about updating my reports and tests were answered and directed to the correct places. In this period where travel is uncertain the staff were well versed with the local regulations and I'm really glad I booked my stay at Westin Chao Yang. Other than getting a well rest (amazing linens and bedding), it was a relief to get peace of mind that the staff were able to communicate well and provide much needed help when required - especially in these times.

The only thing: When I was going to eat breakfast on Sunday I needed to wait 15 minutes until they let me in (many people were waiting but inside were many empty tables) =Ôºû this reduced my breakfast time because I got a place at 10:15 (breakfast is served until 10:30 on Sunday). Also annoying was that there were no napkins around - I used my face mask because I had also a new one in my pocket. The break and crossaints could be fresher & not so hard. All in all this hotel is good (except my experience with the breakfast).

msg:That‚Äôs my worst time in my life in 2021. First day,when I check in the hotel, they told me I did not pay the payment and they want to charge me more. However, I already paid the fee one week ago.The hotel told me to talk with Xie Cheng to get the proof to them. Xie Cheng told me they already let the agency paid the fee but the hotel sales did not pay the hotel.
   Second day, I have a problem about the Beijing Health code. I spent long time to talk with the hotel and nothing happened. My flight will be the morning one 2 days later. So I had to do COVID-19 test myself. After I did myself, the hotel told me they get info from the street and want me do it again. I did, and the code still does not work. The hotel just wait for everything but never care about me. The street government people asked me in the phone: why you call me not the hotel?! Yep, I am so disappointed. In two days I can not go to anywhere and I did not finish my job. They only have three kinds of food listed in the menu in the room. I had to order KFC everyday.No one care about me there. I want to talk with their GM and they stopped me to do it. I will never back again. I was totally stressed out and I can not sleep every night. There is no service here but I had to catch everything myself. In the end, my co-workers told me that they stay in Ku Lum hotel next door and nothing happened to them. My bad, my bad choice!

msg:Nice spot and we enjoyed our stay but, considering this is a 5 star international hotel, the initial check in process was less than satisfactory.  We checked in at 4pm and were told that our room wasn't ready.  We were essentially told to hang out and wait for approximately one hour.  No complimentary drinks or associated effort to relieve the inconvenience.  We were given access to the vip lounge, but I paid for that when I booked the executive room.  The CSR said she would call when the room was ready, she didn't.  We had to go back to the front desk and we got into our room at 5:30.  It was only when I asked to speak to a manager that the situation started to resolve.  To the Westin's credit they did make the situation right and we really did enjoy our stay.  The room was nice and clean, the bathroom and tub was fantastic.  The buffet style breakfast was quite good and had plenty of options.  We enjoyed our time there

msg:The first time I gave a bad review, the reason was that a 400-yuan hotel couldn't do what a 1,400-yuan hotel does. I've always been kind to others and never give bad reviews, but I have to give one this time:
1. They called me to ask about the room requirements, and I said a high floor and sunny side would be fine. I went to the front desk and they said that all the rooms were arranged, but it turned out to be the 13th floor, north-facing!
2. Room facilities: The shower in the bathroom doesn't work, the water flow from the shower head is small, and the water temperature cannot be adjusted.
3. The bedside phone doesn't work, it's broken, and the iron is broken. I can only meet clients in wrinkled clothes, and the elevator is so dark, are you playing an escape room?
4. Breakfast... I actually caught a big hair in the boneless chicken feet, but the noodles are pretty delicious. There's nothing to praise.
The little girl who called me, I'm *********, I finally caught you in this life and I want to take revenge. I've stayed in hundreds of hotels in 14 years, and I've never encountered such a thing!
Didn't I pay for the photos? Don't let people think that I have planned this for a long time, have ulterior motives, and give bad reviews maliciously.

I feel that this is a bit of a discount for a hotel at this price. The lighting in the room is indeed dim and there is nothing too surprising or outstanding.
The bedding is quite comfortable. The quilt is silky smooth and feels good when wrapped.

Before coming here, I had the impression that the service in Beijing was very average. I didn't expect all kinds of surprises after checking in. Hailey at the front desk asked every day if she was satisfied and what were her needs? I brought a fruit plate, a small New Year gift, and a humidifier. I was very attentive and enthusiastic. The service staff in the housekeeping depar**ent are also very enthusiastic and fast, and the mineral water is replenished in a timely manner. I have stayed at Westin hotels in many cities before, and this time the service at the Westin Bohai Runze Hotel in Beijing was the best! Love it, love it!

This one is suitable for business trips and the enjoyment needs to be improved.

Thank you very much! When I checked into the hotel, I felt that the bed and pillows were very comfortable. The room was large and quiet. It is very close to the scenic waterfront of Liangma River. I walked to see the night view. It is also very convenient to walk to Blue Harbor. When I came back at night, the waiter made a bed and gave snacks and water. It felt very warm.

Otherwise it will be very bad! Ctrip did not import the information when booking the room. Zhang Xu at the front desk was very patient in helping me solve the problem. He said sorry throughout the whole process and was very polite! Calling the hotel for having such staff, it is rare for young people to be so patient! They helped me add the service in the executive corridor. I personally think the afternoon tea sandwiches are really good, but when you pick up the plate, you have to pick up the sauce. The hotel's food and beverage depar**ent really needs to pay attention to the hygiene and cleanliness, which is a wake-up call! It is also a hotel in the city center. The parking charges are really difficult to deal with. At least the guests staying in the hotel should be provided with free parking services. Otherwise, who would have to pay hundreds of parking fees every time they stay for several days! The overall hotel service is good, the environment and facilities are average, and the most commendable thing is the considerate service of the service staff ~

msg:I have a very good impression of the area around Liangma River. I came there with the intention of taking photos of the welcome hotel, but I was a bit disappointed. The lobby is quite bright and elegant, and the room view is average. After all, it is not built along the river. The room facilities are a bit old. There is a charge for the mini bar, and a deposit of 2,000 yuan is required. However, when checking out, it is refundable instantly. No You know the significance of the deposit. It is indeed rare for hotels to collect deposits now. The housekeeping attitude is very good and the service is also good. The hotel has a good location, with Liangmaqiao Station right at the door. You can still choose other nearby hotels at similar prices.

I stood near the window and it was very cold. It must have been because the sealing was not good and there was air leakage. There was a musty smell when water came out of the bathroom. Moreover, there is no shaving set and the quilt is uncomfortable. I am not the first one to react to the quilt. Also, there is no five-star service, no turndown, and no welcome fruit, which is not a good experience.

msg:The location is very good (next to the Third Ring Road of Liangmaqiao) and there is a subway downstairs. It is very convenient to go to Wangjing, Sanlitun, Guomao and Asian Games Village, whether by taxi or subway.
1. Service: The reception was good. The guy helped me carry my luggage when I got off the bus. The room was cleaned very well.
2. Facilities: The hotel facilities are not new, but they are not old either. The space is large and the scenery outside the window is great.
3. Comfort: The curtains block out the light very well and the towels have no odor (very rare). The most important thing is: the bedding is really good! Probably the top 2 I have ever stayed in, it is very soft, feels good and close to the body, and is very relaxing after a night's sleep.
Finally, I would like to thank Yori for her considerate service. She knew that I would check out early the next day to catch my car and also gave me a breakfast.
Overall evaluation: It‚Äôs really good. It‚Äôs the best one in my opinion at the same price and similar price compared to the same period last year.

  We checked in on Thursday, the color of the lobby is dark, low-key, and high-end. Relly, the waiter who received us at the front desk, was very, very patient, with a gentle attitude, and our sense of happiness improved a lotü•∞
   The room service is also good, because you need to take the children out to play and need to drink more water. The room attendant replenishes water in a timely manner every day.
   We also went to the second floor to have a lunch, a group purchase set meal, which was delicious.
   The hotel's breakfast is also rich. Drinking a cup of coffee and eating bread every day makes you feel comfortable and happy.

It is a very cost-effective hotel with complete facilities, quiet, clean and comfortable rooms, and the upper floors can overlook the busy traffic of the Third Ring Road. Thanks to Wendy and Queen at the front desk for their warm service. If there is a need, I will choose to stay again.

msg:Overall, it can be said to be a very average hotel at this price. The facilities are old and the biggest disadvantage is that the hotel does not have its own parking lot. Parking at the hotel is not free or requires a lot of money. Staying here for three nights cost more than 200 just for parking. If you are an older friend and not picky, you can still choose. But if you are young or picky, you should choose carefully. It is worth mentioning that the location of the hotel is pretty good. It‚Äôs convenient to go anywhere for basically eating, drinking and having fun.

There are no razors and envelopes in the room. If you want to use it temporarily, you have to wait for the staff to deliver it. It is very inconvenient. I don‚Äôt know if it was missed or permanently removed. You are a business hotel. Envelopes are standard. .

msg:Jinmao Westin is the worst hotel we stayed in this trip. Talk about my feelings:
The first is the location. There are no restaurants around the hotel, and there are no restaurants in the Lufthansa Mall opposite. You must take a taxi to Guomao.
The room is too old. The tables, chairs, walls, and toilets are almost all old-fashioned decorations more than ten years ago. The service is really bad. There is a knocking sound from the spring in the toilet. Ask the master to fix it. There is no way to solve it. It can only be fixed by replacing the components. I asked to change the room, but the front desk didn't know.
The breakfast was even worse. I went to eat around nine o'clock. There was no porridge. There were only two boxes of Mengniu yogurt, bacon, and fruit left. The table was cleaned when there was no rush. It was really bad.
The room we stayed in couldn't sleep at night, there was a roar of machines outside the hotel, and we couldn't fall asleep until we plugged in earplugs at night.
The service was even worse. I notified the housekeeping depar**ent one day in advance and noted the time we checked into the hotel to pick up the room. When I arrived at the hotel, I was told that the room was still being cleaned and there was no room. There was a serious problem with the internal working method of the hotel. The platter settled the matter. Really ten thousand difference.

The front desk staff during the 11th holiday saw that there were a lot of people queuing up with my children to check in, so they took me directly to the executive lounge on the 34th floor. After checking in, I liked that the executive lounge has a wide view and took a lot of photos. I met Aimee and Scott here. The child cried and wanted to drink juice and there was no service in the executive lounge. Scott gave the child juice and upgraded us to a high level. There is no need to say the view of the room type on the floor. It is so beautiful. It was my birthday that day and I thoughtfully presented a fruit plate. Thank you. I have to contact Scott before coming next time! During the period, the telephone front desk is also responsive, this location, this service, really want to give a big compliment!

When checking in, Tracy at the front desk helped patiently answer the package content and upgraded the room type, sincerely grateful! The follow-up catering and services are very satisfactory.

From the hotel from "Welcome" to the lobby, many scenes remind me of the scenes in the play, such as the lobby lounge, such as the concierge for check-in...

The first thing you feel when you enter the hotel is that the concierge in the concierge depar**ent is very enthusiastic and asks the guests if they need to take their luggage.

Bella, who checked in, was also very enthusiastic to help us coordinate the house.

Entering the room, the floor-to-ceiling windows are very large, giving the room a very bright feeling. You can also feel the prosperity of the city when you see the China Zun International Trade District that you have seen through the room.

When it comes to the bed, the bed is very soft, just right for babies who like soft beds

In terms of details, there will be staff from the housekeeping depar**ent to re-arrange the room at night

In short, those who have watched "Welcome" can feel like they are in the TV series, and those who have not watched it can also appreciate the meticulous and considerate feelings of the hotel staff.

Note: The hotel also belongs to the acid zone room. After leaving the hotel, turn left and take a few steps to see the nucleic acid detection point. It is super convenient~

msg:The overall feeling is very satisfactory, especially the service. Wendy who checked us in was very patient and efficient. Seeing the guests waiting for the check-in, he took the initiative to open an additional window.

The room hygiene is very satisfactory, and the bedding is clean and odor-free; the lobby service is also very thoughtful; the best thing is the tiger decoration specially set for the Year of the Tiger this year, it must be a pleasure to bring children.

There is a nucleic acid sampling point 10 meters away from the door, which is a gift for traveling during the epidemic!

The only suggestion is to replace the pillow that is too soft, the neck is very tired when sleeping.

The room is very big, although it is a single bed, it is actually 1.5 meters wide. Is the mattress and pillow is relatively soft, I am not very used to it. The TV can be projected, and there is a good Bluetooth speaker. The sound insulation is also very good. It is suitable for watching dramas and listening to songs. The afternoon tea and dinner included in the package are relatively simple buffets with acceptable quality. The buffet breakfast is ok, but the end time is relatively early. It ends at 10:30 on weekends, so you should come earlier.

msg:I really don't want to say anything more, the five-star hotel, the Westin brand, the poor service and communication, I really didn't expect it.
I suggest everyone that if you stay in this hotel in the future, it is best to check in and ask the housekeeping depar**ent to take you into the room to check all the equipment before checking in. Otherwise, if you check out, you will suspect that you took the things if they are gone.
I brought my child to check in on the 15th, and there was no hotel staff to say hello to the hotel, and there was no concierge to help with luggage. I attribute these to the fact that the epidemic may have just passed and the manpower is tight!
On the evening of the 16th, I wanted to order a breakfast for the morning of the 17th. The front desk staff spoke very fast and had an average attitude. Because in their hotel, if you order breakfast at the front desk, the price is cheaper than going directly to the restaurant to eat breakfast, but you can't refund it if you book it. If you want to bring a child, you can book one directly. When I asked if there is a discount for children, he told me that children are indeed half price, but he can't book children here, he can only book adults, so he ordered breakfast for two adults, and I answered him at that time, then book an adult, children tomorrow I paid on the spot and the attitude of the staff was extremely curt. Later, I reported to the manager on duty, she told me that she was by the side at the time, and she really felt that the attitude of the staff was not very good, but because there were a lot of people queuing at the front desk at that time, the staff was anxious and wanted to hang up the phone quickly to check in for the staff. Well, this is your reason, but this is definitely not an excuse to solve the problem! Remember you are a five-star hotel!
The funnier and more irritating ones are coming. Today, on the 17th, I checked out the room with my child at 10:40 am and stored my luggage. Then I went to the concierge to pick up my luggage around 1:30 pm and left the hotel. I got a call from the hotel reception at 7:30pm asking where I put the JBL stereo in the room? Isn't this a proper suspicion of me? What I want to say is that first of all, there is no mention of such a thing in Ctrip's room facilities introduction (I have booked a lot of hotels on Ctrip in the past few years, and they are basically five-star hotels. Basically, they also write very well. Clearly), secondly, I have never seen such a thing from check-in to check-out, and then I would like to ask what time does your housekeeping depar**ent clean? Why did it take you so long to call me? In the end, I would like to say that you suspect me without checking it out yourself. What do you think? Keep saying that we didn't suspect you, we just asked, if you don't doubt, don't ask, do you think that the guests staying in the hotel are all thieves?
This incident is really annoying, it's too annoying, and it happened in a five-star big brand hotel, what do you so-called managers think? ? ? too speechless

The nucleic acid place is so convenient. I have experienced the gym and swimming pool. Generally speaking, it is still highly recommended. I will choose this hotel next time. For so many years of hotel experience, I still have to trust big brands. But the only thing I understand is because The child is not feeling well. We originally booked two nights for the weekend, and an additional night was increased by more than 100 yuan, and an additional night in the original room was more expensive than the previous night by more than 100 yuan.

So I went there again, and when I told the front desk about it, the front desk emphasized that Jason was here to help out at midnight. What's my business if they help out at midnight? Since the hotel staff said so, just do it. Why are you talking so much nonsense? The front desk looked at the man next to her and said he couldn't walk. Her voice was so sweet. But the service I received from the front desk can only be described as indifferent. Does a five-star hotel's service depend on the face? The welcome fruit was moldy. Haha.

The hotel also gave welcome fruits and a bottle of red wine. There are fewer people living here, so if the occupancy rate is not so high, you can upgrade for free.

The turn-down time is relatively early. We started to notify the turn-down at 6:00 pm, but we didn't ask people to come over to help with the turn-down until after 9:00.

The variety of breakfast is also ok, it can be regarded as a combination of Chinese and Western, but since it was after 9 o'clock, some things are gone. Before the closing of the meal at 10:30, the restaurant waiter will notify each table whether additional meals are required, which is still very good.

üßπSanitation: The sanitary facilities in the guest room are average, and I actually found the paper left by the previous guest, probably because he wrote the words on the back, and the cleaning staff did not see it, so I just put it back bit and did not replace it with a new one.

üçÉEnvironment: The room I stayed in this time is facing the direction of International Trade, so the whole scenery is still very good, next to the Third Ring Road, but the lounge did not feel very noisy at night.

The breakfast options are also very rich, and there is always one that can fill your stomach. . The hotel's front desk service is thoughtful and in place. The most impressive is vicky zhao. The service is very professional, giving people a reliable feeling, with a gentle tone, like a friend who has not seen for a long time without any sense of distance. Overall, I am very satisfied with the hotel stay, the location is very good, the hygiene is very good, 10 points, 5 points for the hotel, 5 points for Vicky

msg:This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in Beijing, bar none,

1. Check-in
The overall time-consuming was too long, and it seemed that the business was very unfamiliar. I didn't pay much attention to it at the time. Anyway, I was asked to fill out a lot of forms.

2. Not cleaning the room
I did go out during the day because I was taking a shower and I was afraid that the waiter would come in, so I pressed Do Not Disturb. I chose to forgive if I didn‚Äôt clean it at noon (but the premise is that the waiter asked me when I would clean it. I said 12 noon, and it was around 11 o‚Äôclock. I had to take a shower So I turned on Do Not Disturb), since I told you the time, why didn't you ask me? It is directly determined that I turned on Do Not Disturb, OK, my choice is my problem, but when I came back at 4 o'clock in the afternoon, the first time I saw that it was not cleaned, I turned off Do Not Disturb, and I went out until 2 o'clock in the morning When I came back and saw that everything in my room hadn‚Äôt been changed, I was furious. I called the front desk and asked why they didn‚Äôt clean it for me, but they said that I will clean it for you now, or I have to go to the airport at five o‚Äôclock in the morning tomorrow morning. Make me even more angry, I told you that we have to check out early in the morning, don't you think it's unreasonable to think about it? very unprofessional

3. Wake up is not in place
The first choice is that I say I have to catch a plane, and set a wake-up call for me. At five in the morning, I call twice. If I don‚Äôt wake up, please knock on my door. It was gone after two beeps, and then I wanted to continue to sleep, but the second time I woke up, I thought I was gone. After the two times, no waiter came to knock on my door. Fortunately, I set a final alarm. Bell woke herself up

4. Breakfast
Very ordinary, few choices, unpalatable

5. The price. I booked on Ctrip for about 2400 for two nights, and I directly deducted the mortgage. As a result, I was charged more than 2700 when I checked out and paid? I came back to look at the invoice carefully and found out, why, I don‚Äôt understand, is it calculated according to the current price?

I don't understand what kind of operation this is. I didn't want to make any comments, but I was really angry when I saw the invoice

Yes, the hotel restaurant is closed on Mondays and Tuesdays. It's so weird. The hotel facilities are old. When the closet door is opened, the lights inside fall out. I didn't sleep well all night. I changed hotels quickly the next day. The parking fee is per hour 10 yuan per hour, not yet capped, 240 yuan for one-day parking, hotel guests pay as they please, no exemption, no discount, because the parking lot is outsourced. The only advantage is that the place where nucleic acid is done is very close, just downstairs.

He took the initiative to upgrade the room and asked the room attendant to bring shaving supplies. The equipment in the room is a bit old, but the bed is relatively comfortable, the TV has foreign channels, and the bathroom amenities are a bit poor. Welcome fruits are delivered slowly. It may be due to too many customers after being urged several times, but there are many varieties of fruits. I bought two breads from the Dessert House in the lobby and tasted good. I ordered a cocktail in the lobby bar in the evening. The bartender was patient and satisfied with the wine mix. I returned to the room and turned down. The breakfast is rich in variety, Western and Chinese styles are full of hot and cold, yogurt and freshly squeezed juice are preferred, overall a satisfactory accommodation

The bathtub was not cleaned for 2 days, and I couldn't help calling customer service on the third day to clean it back. 3. The air-conditioning pipes may not be cleaned, and the table was full of dust the next morning. 4. The razor fell off after cleaning the room and it was not repaid. Could it be that I stayed for 4 days, used it for 2 days, and used it for the remaining 2 days. If the above is an express hotel I have nothing to say about the situation, but it is not acceptable if it is a 5 star hotel.

Although the customer service prompts praised when checking in and checking out, I forgive me for not being able to do it. I hope the hotel will spend more time on the details and services. No customer service prompts are required, and praise will be given.

I didn‚Äôt tell you that if you don‚Äôt eat the complimentary afternoon tea, you can eat the complimentary executive dinner, which tastes average. An order of 60 green vegetables and 70 fried rice is very unpalatable. There was actually blood on the pillow, indicating that the pillow case had not been replaced after the last guest left the store. Because I have a very good impression of the Westin in Singapore, and it is the most expensive hotel nearby, I chose it and was very disappointed. I'm really sorry for the word Jin Mao. I will no longer be superstitious about Westin in the future. Because of the epidemic, I didn't want to change hotels for safety reasons, so I stayed for four days, four very difficult days.

During checkin, the disposable transparent umbrella fell on the isolation belt used to divert order at the front desk.
But I never found it again
Room equipment is quite adequate
The night view of the Third Ring Road is great, after all, the location is good
Fairly satisfactory stay

The same price is not as good as the luxury rooms of Metropark International

Although it may be that you did not receive the fruit because you opened Do Not Disturb, you still have to thank the staff for their kindness, and some staff also called to confirm whether you want it or not. Clean the room hygiene. The cleaning lady on the 21st floor is also very friendly. When checking out at noon, the young lady at the front desk, Alina, cared about the check-in experience and gave a practical storage bag around the hotel. The little robot delivered by the btw concierge is really cute. Please charge it more. Although the hotel has been in use for a long time, and some of the cabinets are relatively old, the staff are really attentive and warm.

Compared to the 30th floor before, it is definitely a little bit worse... If you can only open the back door to travel, it will be affected but not too much.
Affected by the renovation, there are very few types of breakfast...but I still keep the normal price and I have been complaining about it by my friends. After all, I stayed for a few days and breakfast was less than 1,000 yuan.
The positive comments are: the East Third Ring Road, the most congested trunk route in Beijing, the surrounding restaurants and environment are quite convenient. The service and attitude of the service staff are very good~üëçüèª
So I won‚Äôt consider staying again until the renovation is complete~

msg:The summer vacation is coming to an end. I took my kids to find a hotel with a swimming pool to swim. By the way, I took a break by myself. Seeing this room with a view of the East Third Ring Road, I felt that this should be a place for me to relax. As a result, the south-facing room was very popular. Thanks to the help of the duty manager Scott to coordinate, I finally got a room with a satisfactory view as I wish. Thank you very much Scott.

The swimming pool is big and the kids are very happy. There was dinner in the executive lounge, which was unexpectedly delicious, and I was simply full.

Both check-in and check-out had fruit. It is a pleasant city family trip.

There is another place that touched me a lot. The fitness center wrote that children under the age of 14 need to be accompanied by an adult. I fully understand that this is not a toy, but most fitness centers write that children are prohibited from entering, so I introduced the equipment with children this time. A female staff member of the fitness center saw us and told us to swipe in and out after 11 o'clock. The door is about to close, and at the same time, we are polite to ask us to be careful. Minors are generally not recommended to use these equipment. Her words make me very comfortable, thank you.

The water column of the shower head is simply... It feels like it can hurt people, and it hurts when it hits the skin! And it leaks. Every time I wash, there is a puddle of water outside... The next day I found that the water column needs to control the angle by myself to make the water warmer... This is too inhumane! I dare not let my child take a bath alone.
It is also an old hotel. The overall feeling is very old. The light button in the room is also very sensitive... I have to press it for a long time like a **!
Oh, and there is! There is also a note written by the previous guest in the room... Speechless again!
I will never choose this hotel again when I come to Beijing!

You will sleep on a moderately hard and soft bed, and you will find that the air conditioner is adjusted to the temperature you want, the quilt is not light or heavy, the bath water is also the warm and cold you want, the scenery outside the window is not amazing but very attractive, room service It is meticulous and not noisy, and the staff is not overly enthusiastic or indifferent.
Everything is just right, not tailor-made, but also bit by bit; like a trickle flowing by your side, you see, you hear, you may not be praised, but you will be happy.
When you come here, you will not wait to use the place advertised by the circle of friends; but you just feel that you belong here naturally, and this place naturally belongs to your journey.
After all, your tired return, a warm hug, may not be as good as a warm smile.
I don't know if I would recommend it to others, but I will remember it myself.

msg:The service attitude of cathy at the front desk was very good when I checked in. I gave a fruit plate as a gift, but after using the bath towel when I left the store, I found a 2mm transparent milky white bug on my stomach and knocked it down. I immediately reported the complaint to the hotel customer service phone. In such a situation, I didn‚Äôt make any compensation to the hotel. I just felt physically and mentally unwell. Afterwards, there were red spots on the skin where the insects knocked off.

msg:Write a bunch, upload the photos are disappeared üòø This hotel is very good, the room is quiet, relatively large, but the bed is only 1.2 meters wide, the bathroom is easy to use. The service is thoughtful, the robot can send takeaway to the door of the room. Very good. The surrounding diet is particularly convenient. The steak house on the second floor is not recommended, it is not delicious.

msg:Safety issues are prominent, management is chaotic, and there is no service concept. I was sleeping in the morning and the male waiter came in. The waiter asked me if I wanted to do my laundry. I thought it was unbelievable. When I asked for my work number, the waiter said they didn't have a work number. In the end, I was so frightened that I wrapped myself in a quilt on the bed, scolded and rolled away, and the man closed the door and left. I complained to the lobby, but the male manager on duty did not comfort me, or apologized, and asked me about the process in a public relations tone, full of doubts, questioning whether I had changed the room by myself. Two hours later, another woman took care of it and apologized. I thought it was all right, and I was about to take a shower and go to a meeting, but the door opened and a waitress came in again. This woman rang the doorbell, but the time for me to open the door after ringing the doorbell twice was not enough for me to open the door, but she just rang the doorbell to go through the process. I was furious and said that I called the police, and the woman closed the door immediately. The subsequent processing process is even more messy, and it all depends on Ctrip's communication. It‚Äôs just that from the beginning to the end, they think that this matter is not a big deal, and they deal with it in a very public relations tone. They even think that it would be good to compensate you for two nights‚Äô accommodation. No normal staff can feel the panic of customers.
