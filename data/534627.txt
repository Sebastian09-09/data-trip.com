msg:Our first time in Wuhan and glad we chose this hotel to stay in. The rooms were spacious and clean and having a kitchenette and washing machine in the room was a welcome bonus. We have been traveling around China for a while now and it's always nice to be able to conveniently do your laundry and cook home cooked meals once in a while. The breakfast selection was great. Mostly Chinese or asian dishes but this wasn't a problem for me. My husband who is a vegetarian had limited options. It's conveniently located within the cbd and in the same building as Capital mall! You can access the mall from the hotel reception and it was so convenient on days we were lazy to cook and wanted to go out to eat or just to walk around and do some shopping. The mall is also connected to a metro station so that makes it even more convenient for those that need to get around the city. They had a great kids play room and a gym. Rooms were also kept clean. Can't recommend this place enough and will surely be back next time we're in Wuhan!

msg:We booked 4 rooms, 3 double rooms and 1 single room. The location of the hotel is OK, there is a subway station downstairs, but the food is too little. The bread is just sliced ​​bread, and there is no chef to make it on site. There are only three brands of hot food orders every day, and there is only one choice of juice, and there is not even cup yogurt. Compared with Somerset Suzhou, the difference is too big, and you can eat a lot of breakfast there. Wuhan is a city with so many snacks, but the breakfast is so small, and there is not even local carbohydrate cakes. I am very disappointed. The room is just average. The hotel here does not prohibit smoking, and there is a smell of smoke. I changed 2 rooms before it was barely odorless. In short, if you buy a hotel in a location and have requirements for breakfast, choose carefully.

I asked to make up for the difference and upgrade to a suite, and the lady at the front desk upgraded me for free, and her attitude was very good. I'll give this lady 3 stars. The elevators are really ridiculously slow, there are no robots to deliver takeaways, and there is only one elevator going down to the basement. Breakfast,, I don’t know what to say, is not as good as the 7-day chain when I was a student. In the end, it was porridge that was like water. I got some white rice and soaked it in and took a bite.

The front desk on the seventh floor can go directly to CapitaLand. It is very convenient for dining and shopping. There are teas that children like, Yanyuese, Grandpa’s Tea, Naixue’s Tea, Starbucks, etc. The main reason is that you don’t feel cold in the room without air conditioning in winter, so wearing medium-thin pajamas is enough! The hardness of the big bed is also suitable. I have been to several Somerset hotels in other cities and I am very satisfied! The child said he would come and stay next time! 😄The night view of Yellow Crane Tower is worth a visit! Ctrip fares are also discounted!
It’s nice to have table tennis to play in the apar**ent. I’ve played with my children twice!

The location is excellent: it is just above CapitaLand Plaza. There are various teas and coffees in the square such as Chayanyuese, Grandpa's Not Making Tea, etc. There is also an AEON supermarket, which is very convenient. The entrance to the subway station is right at the door, and there is also a bus stop where it is convenient to take a taxi. Hema can also deliver.
We booked a total of 3 rooms, each with different room types. Room 1019 is slightly larger, with a separate laundry room and a clothes rack. The hotel is designed with two bedrooms, two living rooms and two bathrooms, and the master bedroom has a separate bathroom. The other room is a hall sandwiched between two bedrooms, and the bathroom is in the two bedrooms.
The complimentary steak meal also came with matching butter. On the second night of our stay, we were given two more portions. The hotel was so welcoming.

The reply was that because the takeaway ordered by a guest was too big, the existing robot could not deliver it, and a new one was being purchased, but staff could be arranged to deliver it. After checking in, I ordered takeaway and called the front desk, and the reply was that such service was not provided and I had to go downstairs to get it myself. I saw the same complaint in the reviews, which is very strange.

The front desk service of the hotel was good, and they booked and confirmed the delivery service for us on the last day. A brand new Buick commercial vehicle took our family to Hankou Station. Thank you very much.

If you can't afford it, don't stay here. You won't refund the deposit without Ctrip's urging. The deposit charge is too ridiculous. The front desk staff likes to taunt customers! The room was cleaned and toiletries were not replenished. For three days and two nights, two rooms were given one toothbrush for one day and the other room was not given. I also asked Ctrip. Ctrip only gave it to the hotel! How can you give it a five-star rating when it is so bad? It’s very harsh to call the front desk. What’s the matter with you? Don’t you know how to use polite words? Is the hotel open to welcome guests or does it want to close down? It is really giving Wuhan a premium and embarrassing Wuhan.

msg:During this trip, I stayed at two Somersets hotels in Xi'an and Wuhan. In comparison, I was really dissatisfied with the one in Wuhan. The check-in process was very unpleasant. When I booked the hotel, I paid extra to choose a room with a bathtub. I wanted to take a bath at night to relieve fatigue, but when I entered the room, there was no bathtub. I argued with the front desk, and then I was reluctantly moved to the next room. I had to drag my luggage to the front desk to change my card. There was no apology in the whole process. "I'm confused. Do employees get rewards from the hotel for letting customers stay in rooms without bathtubs?" Ctrip originally marked a room with a bathtub, so why did it treat it like a charity? In addition, the breakfast is very average and far different from that of Somerset in Xi'an. The only good thing is the room cleaning staff, who are also attentive and attentive.

msg:The two-bedroom apar**ents in this hotel all have two double beds. Except for the standard room for cats, I thought that the theme might be more popular with children, so I stayed in an ordinary two-bedroom executive apar**ent for one night and went through all the hard work to move out. Cats come and everything goes completely wrong!
The Ctrip order I placed clearly stated that breakfast included four buffets, but when I checked in, I was told that the breakfast for this theme room would be delivered to the room separately by the staff. I asked specifically what to eat and was told that there were no meals. The list is roughly the type of rice flour soup purchased from outside. Okay, just make sure it's for four people.
Breakfast was indeed delivered on time the next day. The meals were as follows: one mung bean soup, one white fungus soup, one steamed cake, two eggs, five steamed buns, two hot dry noodles, and two chopsticks.
That's it? ? Is this really breakfast for four people?
I got a confirmation from the hotel that it was for four people. Then the room manager came to the room to explain to us.
Asked why there are only two chopsticks for four people? Answer: Maybe it fell off on the road...
How do you explain two drinks? Answer: Drinks are not available to everyone.
What about eggs? Answer: Not everyone has it.
What about hot dry noodles? Answer: Not everyone likes to eat pasta. This is a local specialty, so I give it to you to try.
The price of the hotel buffet is 50 per person. If you deliver the meal, it should be the same, or at least enough to feed four people. I checked on ** for the delivery, and the total price is No more than 40, less than 10 yuan per person. Does the hotel need to search to this extent in order to control costs? Why don't you just make it clear that we won't provide breakfast due to cost control, please take care of it yourself. Since we are traveling, we don't mind paying for it out of our own pockets.

房間裏設施有點老舊了，但維護的還不錯，衞生也挺好，自己做了飯菜！
過道里一股奇怪的味道。
地理位置方便，價格也不貴。

等我上了高鐵 給我瘋狂打電話 在沒有任何證據的情況下 指認我們損害了酒店房間的吹風機 還是國外定製的限量版 特別難買 要我們賠付將近600元
簡直是莫名其妙 酒店自己的吹風機本身就是壞的 我們沒有找你們麻煩 酒店還敢倒打一耙 找我們索賠？？？
武漢的酒店行業是可以不遵循法律 罔顧消費者權益？隨意剋扣我銀行卡的金額？我明明退房了卻拒不辦理按金退款和房費結算服務～
我一定會投訴到消協和相關管理部門～用微博**等同步曝光你們這種非法可恥的行為.
從此你們酒店我再也不會住了！！！

第二次來的時候一家五口一起來的，開個套間衹需要600+，真的是非常實惠。
這次第三次過來，帶孩子去協和就診。在導航軟件上看了一些酒店，偶然登陸攜程發現了收藏裏有盛捷，沒想到裏協和也非常近，打車衹需要起步價。酒店也很人性化，退房延長到下午一點多，吃完飯給前台打電話讓汽車離場。

🚗 交通：十分方便。門口有地鐵站，有立交橋，不遠就有大型醫院。
🧹衞生：沒有硬傷，挺好的。
🍃環境：除了窗户不能打開，不過高層來説也挺正常的。
🔔服務：基本上衹有前台，第一次去可能會不太好找。

主要寫點評的原因是由於出差報銷的事情出了一些問題，與攜程客户聯繫的時候客户小姐姐（xiao昕昕）態度絕對是超五星級的，
既温柔又善解人意，在瞭解到我與公司財務的一些認識上的差異後還主動協助解決問題。毫不誇張的説，在絕對優質的服務面前，
所謂的問題都已不重要了。再次表示感謝！
