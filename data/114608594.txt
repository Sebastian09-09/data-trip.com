msg:This is my second time to this InterContinental. I came here to celebrate my friend's birthday a month and a half ago, and I have a certain understanding of their team and service. This time I celebrated my birthday by myself. After thinking about it, I felt that choosing Wuxi Taihu New City InterContinental was the most reassuring. I contacted James, the duty manager who arranged various details for me last time. Sure enough, communication, ordering, and reservations were all smooth.
The night before check-in, the hotel front desk called to ask what time to arrive at the store. I guess they wanted to arrange the decoration of my room. After all, the decoration of the cake needs to consider the best production time.
On the day of arrival, I checked into the room. The whole surprise was different from the last time I decorated my friend's birthday. The room manager Wendy is really Doraemon. I only dream, and she is responsible for making it come true!
I am already dreaming about the next time!
Although this hotel is very business-style, it is still very suitable for vacation and relaxation. I like the executive lounge here very much. It is a pain point on the second floor, but everything else is more comfortable. The tea set is exquisite and elegant, and the table is mirrored and transparent. It looks particularly good in photos, so I have to make a video collection of the beautiful photos taken in the lounge. The afternoon tea and happy hour desserts in the lounge focus on variety, and the taste and ingredients are also more sincere. By the way, my birthday cake is amazing, and the bakery should be specially praised. The various breads are also delicious. Happy hour has four hot, two fried, and two staples. The varieties of salads, cheese platters, and ham slices are sincere, and the presentation is very good. I have a bit of obsessive-compulsive disorder, and I will have an appetite when I see fresh, beautiful and neat presentation. There are a lot of varieties of various wines. I don’t drink, but I like beautiful cocktails. This is the highlight of the lounge. Manager Wen carefully arranged a birthday cocktail for me. The beautiful cocktail in the video, like a work of art, comes from the cooperation between Manager Wen and Daisy and Sergio. Many details reflect the intentions of the lounge team, such as the folded napkins printed with "Happy Birthday". Daisy and Sergio are very careful. They took the initiative to help me get fruits and deliberately arranged them in a neat and refreshing shape. Sergio also took a group photo for us very patiently, just to capture the moment we were satisfied with. In my mind, this executive lounge is the main motivation for me to come to this InterContinental again. Although it is difficult to adopt all the advantages of the executive lounges of other hotels, it already has its own unique highlights.
Some of the pain points I experienced last time have been improved this time. The room cleaning is perfect and the breakfast service is perfect. I praise the sister at the breakfast noodle bar for her enthusiasm and thoughtfulness. She took the initiative to help me cook with various vegetables. The toppings at the noodle bar are also very sincere, so I come to eat every time. The ingredients in the cereal area are surprising, including macadamia nuts. I also have to eat egg rolls every time.
An unexpected gain, I met the front desk manager Ms. Shen in the lobby on the third day, and she also arranged a visit to the Indigo Hotel opposite for me. Minny Du of the Indigo Hotel took us to visit the lobby, restaurant, four guest rooms, gym and swimming pool, which gave us a new vision of the characteristics of the Indigo Hotel.
The green space outside the hotel is so beautiful. I go out for a morning run every day. I like the environment here so much.
It lacks a little bit, such as resident singing in the night bar. If there is, it will add points.
I wish this hotel will be better and better!

msg:A newly opened InterContinental in Wuxi has very new facilities and equipment. The rooms are equipped with Dyson hair dryers, which is very luxurious. Currently, the Minibar can be used for free in the first round, which is very nice. The service is attentive, and every service staff you encounter will show a warm smile. Especially the guys and girls at the front desk are very enthusiastic and proactive. The room is also very clean and the air conditioning works very well. There are many kinds of breakfast, and the croissants are delicious. The switchboard gave me a late check-out time of 14:00 in the afternoon. The lady in the guest room was polite, the gym was sparse and clean, and the swimming pool was very clean. It was reserved, haha. The afternoon tea products were beautiful and suitable for taking pictures. I ate Cantonese food in the Chinese restaurant and it tasted good.

Cons: The quality of the fruit drinks for breakfast needs to be improved. The egg buns are not cooked. The bread is fresh and delicious.
Suggestions: The surrounding natural environment is good and suitable for cycling. It would be better if there is a service to rent bicycles

The hotel receptionist Sarah upgraded us to a high-rise room in advance, which was very convenient without waiting. There was also a birthday decoration, which was a little surprise. The service staff in the hotel were well trained and smiling, and helped to solve small problems after check-in in time. The only drawback is that the house construction around the hotel affects the landscape. There are two wetland parks not far away by car, which are suitable for running, cycling and getting close to nature.

There is no scenery outside the window, many construction sites are still under construction around, and there seems to be a wetland park on the other side of the window sill that is not visible...
There is a swimming pool on the 4th floor of the hotel, not big or deep, more suitable for people like me who have basically lost their swimming skills to splash around 😂
The hotel service is also very good, the front desk lady Sarah is very responsible and the communication is smooth...
In general, this hotel gives me a more business-like feeling, and may not be suitable for parent-child travel...

This time I booked an executive room. Needless to say, the room is of a high standard as always. I would like to commend the cocktails in the executive lounge, which can provide guests with cocktails of different flavors. What impressed me most this time was the hotel's service. The lobby manager Snow helped arrange a great accommodation experience. He also explained the hotel's facilities in detail when we checked in, which greatly facilitated our activities in the hotel. The surrounding area of ​​the hotel is also very quiet. It is highly recommended. I will choose this hotel next time I come to Wuxi!

msg:Taking advantage of the small off-peak period before the Qingming Festival and the cherry blossom season, we set off from Shanghai for 1.5 hours, played the Water Margin of the Three Kingdoms that our children have longed for, and visited Nanchang Street. It is suitable for family travel. After looking at many hotels, I chose the relatively new InterContinental Hotel. Thanks to Ctrip for the discounted package, it was very cost-effective and the parking was very convenient. There were two underground floors and a lot of parking spaces. The gate concierge was very proactive, opening and closing the doors promptly when seeing the vehicle and helping to carry luggage. Check in was smooth and smooth. The room is not too big, it's quite satisfactory. I can't say it's great, nor is it too bad. The disadvantage is that the bed is a bit narrow, and the toilet in the bathroom does not have a smart lid. It should be cold in the winter. The experience is not good. The bathroom is quite large and the water temperature is warm. The water output is very good and very comfortable, but it is recommended to prepare disposable bath products. The towels are big and thick, nice. Although there was a slight hiccup during the check-in process, it was resolved smoothly through communication with Peter in the lobby. I would like to thank him again for his handling ability.

msg:The new decoration smells too strong!!! It is near the Expo Center and far from the city center!
Because I changed hotels in the middle of the night and wanted to change to a cleaner one, I chose this one because I didn't know the local area and didn't know that it was next to the Expo Center in the new district, which was far away and not very convenient.

After arriving, it was almost 1 o'clock. I checked in. I asked the front desk if I could upgrade the room so late. The front desk said to see and started to handle the procedures. In the end, I didn't know whether it was upgraded.

Then I went upstairs and it was a room with a strange layout. There was a cabinet with three sides that could be opened in the middle of the room, and then a bathtub, and the bed was behind the bathtub... The room seemed cramped. There was a Dyson hair dryer and a capsule coffee machine. Air purifier (broken). Then, when I was ready to wash, I found that the toilet lid was broken and the drain of a sink was broken.

Then I called the front desk and said that I would change the room immediately. After waiting for a while, they came up and took us to another room.

The room was much more regular, but there was no coffee machine. I don't know if it was downgraded. The air purifier was turned on very high, and the room smelled a bit.
Later, when I went to bed, I turned down the purifier and the smell was quite obvious. I stayed there for one night and decided to change hotels tomorrow.

There were a lot of people at breakfast, all of whom were attending the conference. The waiter took us to a special corner and then turned away. He didn't ask if we wanted tea or coffee. I went over and asked him to pour tea and water. Later, he put the tea and water on another table😅. Business hotel, the food is average.

msg:I went to Yuantouzhu to see cherry blossoms. It was raining and the weather was bad. I stayed in the hotel for two days and lived in an executive king room on the 24th floor. The facilities of the new hotel are very good. The air purifier is turned on 24 hours a day and there is no smell of decoration. The bathroom is what I value most. The shower room has a lot of water and the water flows smoothly. The gym in the public facilities may be a little dusty because not many people go there. Apart from that, there are no defects. The hotel staff I met were very friendly and responded quickly to customer needs. There was a lady with glasses in the executive lounge who was very meticulous and considerate. She also took the initiative to print a local travel guide for me. I hope to meet her again next time. The food is satisfactory, and the taste varies from person to person, so I won’t comment too much. In general, this newly opened hotel gives people a feeling of vigor and vitality. It’s pretty good.

The hotel opened in 24 years, and everything is very new. I stayed in a deluxe king-size bed room, which has spacious space, comprehensive facilities, and an air purifier. At present, the surrounding area is still under development, so it is more suitable for pure stay hotels. The buffet in the morning and evening is generally satisfactory, combining Chinese and Western, and the combination is good. For dinner, there are Western, Japanese, fruit, and drinks.

msg:This is the first time I have given a negative review to Intercontinental. I have never seen any intercontinental breakfast served in the executive lounge. There are very few choices. There are a few leftovers on the table two or three steps away. I thought I could only eat a bowl of noodles or wontons, but the aunt told me that there were no wontons. There is only noodles left. OK, no problem. After a while, I took it to my hand and saw that there was only a little noodle at the bottom of the big bowl. I could count it and there were no more than ten noodles. One chopstick was gone. It’s understandable to be afraid of wasting a small amount, but this is called searching. I looked up at the table next door. There were several grown men sitting on the sofa with their heads down eating breakfast on the coffee table. I immediately felt that we were being treated so ridiculously. Executive lounge, relaxing lounge, come and have breakfast for us? The luxury five-star hotel told me that it decides where to dine based on the number of guests. So do we need to inquire about the number of guests before we check in? Otherwise, there would be nothing to eat, so why would you enjoy different breakfasts at the same price? We went to the fourth floor to eat when there were many people staying, but when there were less people staying, we were forced to go to the executive lounge on the second floor. Not to mention the new hotel, it is precisely because of the new hotel that management should be strengthened.

msg:I didn’t want to comment at first, but this hotel is really speechless. I went to the hotel first to get a room, went upstairs and got a haircut. There was a man living inside. His bags and clothes were all thrown on the sofa, as well as office stuff. The quilt was also flipped. I sent a message to the person. I didn't think about it. Otherwise, how could I go to the front desk to check in? I was so frightened that my heart jumped into my throat. I quickly ran out and sent a message to the other party and called the front desk. Everyone was panicking because this hotel is a newly opened location. Relatively speaking, I drove here in a state of confusion. When my partner came and told the front desk, they just said sorry and moved me to another room. I really wanted to get angry because he was going abroad in two days, so I just worried that he would be unhappy. You say I'm looking for trouble, but I still have to say this. For a big five-star hotel that charges more than 1,000 yuan on holidays, I would like to ask, just because your hotel is so big, you only charge this kind of thing, and others can't keep up. ? Even the most basic things are so poorly done. I would like to give some advice to friends who are out on business. Moreover, the corridor smells like freshly decorated paint. It is not worth the price of more than 1,000!!!

🎈房間的衞生狀況也非常出色，乾淨整潔，一塵不染。床鋪柔軟舒適，讓我在疲憊的旅途中得到了極好的休息。

😍更讓我驚喜的是，這家酒店雖然低調，但卻處處透露着奢華的氛圍。無論是裝修風格還是傢俱擺設，都彰顯着高品質和獨特的品味。

👍酒店的地理位置也十分優越，周邊交通便利，無論是出行還是購物都非常方便。

🙏總之，我對這次的住宿體驗非常滿意。如果有機會，我還會再來這裏，繼續享受這種舒適與奢華的完美結合。

早餐品質一如既往，品類多味道好，比如小麪包甜點等都是當天現烤，味道不輸麪包店，讓我對甜點重燃了興趣。服務經理熱情且敏鋭關注到住客的每個需要，微笑給了人一天的好心情。美中不足就是餐廳年輕人感覺上崗培訓時間較短，回覆住客有些僵硬木訥，還需要多歷練和更自信。
酒店位置有利有弊，離市中心和著名景點有點遠，周邊餐飲購物等商業設施較少，不難叫車，旁邊就有個地鐵站。好處是少了車流與喧鬧，與國際會議中心和濕地公園融為一體的建築羣設計，位置得天獨厚，出門散步簡直不要太舒服。空氣中的負氧離子和綠地草坪，空氣質量與西雙版納的洲際有一拼，讓人衹想大口呼吸。值得常來

msg:這次入住洲際是我十多年來最差的一次體驗，分享出來供無錫出差的人蔘考：
1，酒店的設計應該是極其不專業的人設計的。第一，地下車庫入口處標識不清楚，入口下去5-10米後竟然是死路。需要在極窄的車道中掉頭。車庫沒有酒店的工作人員引導，為了建築工人酒店大堂怎麼走。説不知道，我也理解，人家是建築工人。又不是酒店的人。然後就看見酒店大堂的標識貼在那裡，需要一進車庫急-左轉?!! 酒店的兩排行車道非常窄，在無錫這樣的城市，是怎麼想的呢？萬一有人停車靠前一點，會車並行都要很小心；
2，最震驚的是前台的美女接待。辦理入住的時候，説查不到預訂訊息，我朋友都入住了，仍然查不到。然後換了另外一個房間的另一個人，也查不到，過了一會查到了。然後我就想換個前台也辦理入住。美女剛想走，我過去的時候她衹好回來。最精彩的是，美女氣得把手裡的東西摔在桌子上表達不滿。我説你是現在不能辦理嗎，我可以換回去，美女面無表情的説，沒事。然後同樣找不到我的預訂，給了房間號。然後報錯我朋友的名字。繼續等待不知道在幹嘛中，也不告知。
幾分鐘後，美女到對面前台去指導另外一個男生了。excuse me?
3,然後兩位前台女士隔空商量外籍人間護照要掃描嘛？然後未告知客人，未解釋的情況下用手機把護照訊息，簽證和入境記錄都拍照了。個人私隱法沒有聽説過嗎？
被質疑後説，酒店複印機沒到位。酒店的培訓還不熟悉。開國際玩笑嗎？1300一晚的洲際，收費到位了，硬件和服務不到位沒有關係的。客人忍受就好了。
4，我在前台的下面一層看到有客人留下的剔牙的牙線棒，提醒她找人扔了。等我們辦完入住，晚上出來吃飯，再回去睡覺的時候。仍然在。。。。
5，房間裏新裝修的味道非常重，衹好夜裡開窗透氣。風大，一夜沒睡着。然後早上5點多，對面建築工地在施工。。。
除了前台的美女，我們走的時候也看着她戴上口罩，一副臭臉。其他餐廳的工作人員，一樓衞生間的打掃阿姨都很在線。會熱情打招呼，協調。高峯期都很理解。
但是酒店的前台入住，奇葩的停車場設計。大堂前台如此侷促的設計，房間裏濃烈的裝修味道。
以上種種都讓我無比覺得奇葩和糟心。
雖然你們靠近展覽中心，估計也無所謂客人的感受，但是既然扛着洲際的品牌又亮出了1300一晚的房價。麻煩你們儘量對得起自己的良心，否則客户衹能是一次性的。
長久下去，終究有一點會反噬的。
