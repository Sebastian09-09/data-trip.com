msg:The first time I knew Zouping was because of the recommendation of my friends in the circle of friends. A good friend posted a lot of super beautiful scenery pictures in the circle of friends. After asking, I found out that it was the Snow Mountain Resort in Zouping. After confirming the location, I quickly arranged time to experience the natural scenery here. After recommending it online, I finally chose Zouping Blue Sea Royal. Because I have stayed in this brand on business trips before, I feel very familiar with it. The hotel facilities are still very good. Maybe because it is the off-season, the flow of people is not large. The lady at the front desk also upgraded the room. Because it was only opened last year, the decoration of the room is very new. I got up early in the morning and went for a morning run on the mountain. I could see little rabbits and squirrels. The air was really good and I felt relaxed. There are also cherry blossom mountain, butterfly happy valley, and forest park around the hotel. It is only 10 minutes away from the high-speed rail station. According to the recommendation of the hotel staff, you can also camp at the foot of the mountain. The only bad thing is that the takeaway is too far away and you can't order coffee. There is a snack bar in the hotel, which is very convenient for dining and the dishes are also OK~ Overall, I am very satisfied with this stay. I will definitely stay here for a few more days if I have the opportunity in the future to experience it~
Facilities: The room hardware is very new, smart curtains

Hygiene: The service of the housekeeper is very enthusiastic. After checking in, the fruit plate was delivered immediately. The hygiene is good
Environment: The environment is too good, nothing to say

Service: The overall service is still good, especially the housekeeper

msg:Adjacent to the north gate of Sakura Mountain, you can see the Sakura Pavilion on Sakura Mountain from the hotel. The hotel is a luxury hotel in the resort area with an exclusive dense forest, which is quite quiet and beautiful. The hotel facilities are new and the lobby is grand. The hotel is built on the mountain and the rooms are built on the slope. Please note when booking that the windows of the special king-size bed room are relatively small and you can't see the scenery. However, it doesn't matter if we stay for one night. Next time I come, I will book a room with a view. It is very comfortable to sit outdoors and eat barbecue at night, and the service attitude of the service staff is very good.

msg:The hotel feels great! Located halfway up the mountain, it is especially suitable for viewing. I checked in at the end of March, which happened to be the season when the cherry blossoms bloomed on Sakura Mountain⛰️. From a distance, the mountains were covered with pink skirts. The barbecue festival opened on the day of check-in. It felt great to have a small barbecue on the mountain. The room was very clean and tidy, and there was a beautiful fruit plate for free. The service staff was very good. The overall feeling was good! The only drawback was that the breakfast variety was not very rich. Some food had been gone for a long time and no one came to add it. In addition, the charge for large bottles of bottled water was not reasonable. One bottle of mineral water per person per day of accommodation was definitely not enough. A large bottle of 1.5 liters was charged 10 yuan. I personally feel that drinking water should be satisfied.

The hotel is based on the renovation of the old Snow Mountain Hotel, so the facilities are not as five-star, I believe everyone can understand.

The environment is first-class, built on the mountain, it must be very beautiful in season.

It is still a bit cold in March, and it should be very comfortable in summer. The food is good,

There were people knocking on the door in the afternoon and early morning, and the noise in the corridor disturbed the neighbors. I told the front desk several times and complained several times, but there were still people knocking on the door to harass, affecting my rest and work. The experience was very bad. I hope that the guests staying in the hotel can have a quiet and undisturbed rest environment. The hotel service management needs to be strengthened and guests should not be disturbed at will.

After walking around twice, there were only pickles and no eggs. Several guests joined together to find the restaurant manager to update some food, but it was snatched up as soon as it came. Some guests even grabbed the buns with their hands without using public tableware! The hotel knew that the rooms were fully occupied, so why was there a serious shortage of food during meal time? The restaurant manager is unqualified👎
