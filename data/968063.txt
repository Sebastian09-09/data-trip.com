        I have the habit of getting up early, so I was pleasantly surprised to find that I had booked a city view room, where I could see the wonderful photo of the reclining Buddha holding elixirs. I had heard before that praying to the reclining Buddha from a distance can lead to good health, longevity, happiness and conten**ent! Make a wish quickly😊
        After watching the sunrise, go to the health and fitness center for morning exercise! Haha, the staff arrived earlier than me, but fortunately they opened the door for me quickly. This morning exercise location is also amazing, full of sunshine, and the sound of birds accompanies my morning exercise!
       I was also very satisfied with the breakfast. I chose the original food I like to eat. The staff were so considerate and made me feel warm!
      A beautiful morning gives me full energy to start today’s trip! Thanks for everything!

The room is small and the decoration is very old. The hygiene is poor and the bathroom does not have a bathtub. There is only one restroom. The service attitude is only so bad. The extra bed on the platform is RMB 150. When I arrived, I was told it would cost RMB 200. The breakfast was the worst I have ever had in a hotel in Meizhou. It was a very bad experience. In a fifth-tier city, a five-star hotel charges more than 1,300 per night for a suite with only one bed. It’s really not a five-star hotel worth staying in. Don’t be fooled.

msg:The location of the hotel is okay, but the decoration is very old. There is no service, no one tells us where to eat breakfast, we have to decide by ourselves.
There are very few varieties of breakfast. It's not even considered a five-star hotel. It's not as good as a chain hotel.
During the Spring Festival night, I was told that there was no heating and air conditioning. My parents felt cold. Later, they asked for a heater, but it was still warm.
In short, I don’t recommend it very much, just because it is a five-star hotel with a relatively luxurious appearance. The other check-in experience is very average. There are also consumption items in the hotel, including a box of more than 100 gift dolls, which will be dismantled if the children don't know about it. There is free water in the room. But they also included mineral water that cost RMB 15 per bottle at your own expense, which was very uncomfortable.
I didn’t even take a photo.

There was an emergency at night and the front desk was perfectly resolved.
The cleaning lady was also very enthusiastic and meticulous, and provided free laundry service. She sent it out in the morning and arrived at the room on time in the afternoon.
There are a variety of breakfasts, including special pickled noodles and rice rolls, which are delicious!
The lobby decoration is very similar to the Korean drama Dingding Hotel! I like it very much! It is the service level that a five-star hotel should have!
I will stay here again next time! Thank you for your hard work!

It's a five-star hotel, but the elevators and corridors are filled with a strong smell of smoke, which even seeps into the room. I called the front desk and they said there was nothing they could do and the guests had to smoke. This is not the service attitude and environment that a five-star hotel should have. There are two small bottles of complimentary mineral water in the room, which should be about 300ml, and then there are two bottles of mineral water for the two children and one for an unknown age. You can see the price for yourself😄The buffet is also very poor and there are few varieties. No one was cutting the salmon at the stall, and they didn't dare let the chef do it. I don't know how long the salmon had been there. The lamb chops were pretty good.

msg:怎麼説呢，偶爾回來都是住這裏，但是酒店的洗漱用品還是一樣的廉價，梳子單薄，洗髮水沐浴露如同皂角液勾兑，好歹也是五星級，在這個用品上是不是可以些微提升一下？
另外，燒熱水的壺確實是這個房間多日沒人入住（或使用）上有一層薄薄的灰，不過不影響使用。
洗手間的紙巾及單薄又窄，個人認為多此一舉用那個紙巾筒。衞生間紙巾筒不墊膠袋個人感覺隔應。可能是個人習慣而已。馬桶旁邊有個手機託架和衞生袋為最完美。
圖就不上了，衞生大致上不錯，枕頭略低，床墊過軟，睡一晚上不太適應。這都屬於個人習慣。
洗漱用品差評，不能忍。
