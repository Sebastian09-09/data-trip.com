There's so much history in this property and it's a job to explore all the nooks and crannies and see it all.  The food is great, the service is top-notch.  The rooms are small and old, of course, but i hope you don't stay in the room too much.  it's also very pricey, but you get the location with that price.

msg:Xinxin Hotel is a treasure hotel for my recent business trip and parent-child trip. The hotel itself is located in the West Lake Scenic Area, on Beishan Road, where there are a series of old buildings with a history of a hundred years or more. Most of them are lake-view villas in Western or Chinese and Western styles. The original owners were Zhejiang officials or business tycoons during the National Government period. Now most of them are museums, art galleries, memorial halls or provincial cultural relics. Walking on this street, not only can you see the beautiful scenery of lakes and mountains, but also a strong historical and cultural a**osphere. The reception staff at the front desk of the hotel are very good, professional and thoughtful, with a warm smile. There is also a beautiful lady in the lobby, Guo the foreman, who really answers all the questions of the guests. On the first floor facing the front desk is the 1913 living room, and on the left hand side of the entrance is the 1913 restaurant, which is full at meal times. Our room has a terrace of about 4 square meters, with a little lake view, and the scenery is great. The room is very quiet, the welcome fruit is rich, and free drinks and yogurt are also available. The interior decoration is elegant and nostalgic, with dark green as the main color, which fits well with the herringbone dark brown floor. Sister Yang Xiaolan, who cleaned the room, was very serious and asked repeatedly if there was anything else she needed. She was very enthusiastic and capable. The old-time a**osphere in the room was very consistent with my aesthetics and love, and I took many photos. The "Guyun Caoshe" on the west side of the lobby was lit up at sunset, and the a**osphere was simply beautiful. French food and afternoon tea were provided there. The hotel's breakfast was very rich. If you were lucky, you would be arranged to sit by the window, and the lake view in front of you was a vivid picture. If you plan to come to Hangzhou again in summer and early autumn, Xinxin Hotel will definitely be your best choice next time.

msg:Xinxin, with a good geographical location, not only has a long cultural heritage of the Republic of China, but also has a retro and nostalgic decoration style. The lake view room can directly face the West Lake view in the room. Sitting on the bed, you can make a cup of tea with the Nongfu Spring baby water prepared by the store, and enjoy the fruit and cereal yogurt. You can enjoy it in the room, especially the strong misty rain in Jiangnan. Breakfast is in the 1913 restaurant, with a rich variety of Chinese and Western breakfasts. It would be more perfect if the steak was fried freshly. The auntie is also very diligent in cleaning the room. In the afternoon, she will take the initiative to send fruit and water to the room. The toiletries are L'Occitane, baby products are also prepared, and there is a bath set for the bathtub. Uncle Chen's storytelling is the hotel's feature. After breakfast, I waited for Uncle Chen to tell stories. I have a deeper understanding of the hotel and the Republic of China period. I hope the hotel can keep up with the new era. Although there are electric curtains written on the bedside table, they cannot be used. Overall, I feel very satisfied and will continue to choose Xinxin when I come to Hangzhou next time!

Every morning at 9 o'clock, "Uncle Chen" wearing a long gown and a hat came to the hotel lobby on time to tell the guests who were interested in staying at the "Xinxin Hotel" about the century-old history and celebrity anecdotes of the "Xinxin Hotel". It was wonderful. Follow "Uncle Chen"'s steps into the "Qiu Shui Villa", which is said to be the most expensive in China, and take a look at the overview of the luxury hotel. In short, staying at Hangzhou Xinxin Hotel is worth the money.

Every table and chair is restored to the way it was more than 100 years ago. There is a whole wall of celebrities who have stayed there. The platform on the 7th floor overlooks the West Lake. The floor attendants are very enthusiastic and greet us proactively. The room is clean and distinctive. The hotel has a project called "Uncle Chen Tells Stories". Uncle Chen is a native of Hangzhou. He is knowledgeable and humorous. My husband and I didn't go to the scenic spots after listening to him for 2 days. It's better than reading for ten years.

In the past six months, because my uncle's hearing and health have declined, I, a person who does not do my job, began to take him to visit old comrades frequently. This time he was supposed to go to Suzhou, but he said he wanted to visit the Baidi Bridge where he and his comrades walked. Unexpectedly, I chose a super cute hotel to stay in!
We booked a parent-child room, the small bed is not small at all! And it also has a small bathtub. The room on the sixth floor can see the West Lake. I also took a picture of the sunrise!
Before departure, my uncle said: "You book a room where a child has lived, it may be very dirty."
It turns out that it is not at all! ! Clean and fresh, what a surprise. And there are cereal yogurt cups every day. I will not comment on the hotel restaurant because I am not used to it, but the environment is full marks! It is worth recommending. (o^^o)

msg:Xinxin Hotel is located on the romantic Beishan Road in Hangzhou and has a history spanning two centuries. The design was completed in 1913 and is called "THE NEW HOTEL" in English. The name of the hotel comes from the "Book of Rites·University": "New every day, new every day, new every day" contains the best wishes of "forge ahead"! Some people call it the "Peace Hotel in Hangzhou", while others say it is the "Celebrity Chronicle". Soong Ching Ling, Xu Zhimo, Lu Xun, Lin Huiyin, Zhang Ailing and other half of the celebrities and dignitaries at that time stayed here. I love this Republic of China style! Because the hotel is under renovation, we upgraded the room for free. I love it! 1913 has a good dining environment, good taste, and good service. I even took a group of photos of "flowers" in the evening. It felt great!

In particular, the details are very well done, such as the hot water in the shower is hot immediately, and there is no need to wait at all. The bedroom is not big but the bathroom is spacious and comfortable, and the design is very reasonable. The Tourism Depar**ent should also give a thumbs up to Xiao Guo from the Tourism Depar**ent and the driver Master Zhu, who are considerate and enthusiastic in service. The restaurant's products are absolutely first-class! Although the hotel was booked in a hurry for the May Day trip, I was really satisfied with the stay. I will definitely come back to experience it when I come to Hangzhou in the future. A kind reminder: the toiletries, shower gel and shampoo in the bathroom are different. Don't just put shower gel.

It's also a great thing to have afternoon tea in the garden while looking at the lake view.
But one night at 11 o'clock, a strong smell of cigarettes suddenly drifted into the room, but there was no smell in the corridor. It was probably someone in the nearby guest room secretly smoking, and the smoke came through the ventilation duct. Damn!

The basic service attitude of the service staff is very good. 3. I like the hotel's sense of history and the overall decoration style of the room. The bad points: 1. On the day we arrived, the doorman was just putting on a display and ignored everyone he saw. On the day we left, the doorman at least helped carry the luggage. 2. When I entered the room, I saw several pieces of cut nails on the floor, which was a bit disgusting. 3. The air conditioner is too ridiculous. No matter how it is set, the room temperature is always 26 degrees, which is equivalent to turning on a hot air conditioner. The room is very hot with or without the air conditioner. After telling the front desk, they were told that it cannot be adjusted. 4. The toilet does not have an automatic flip-up lid. 5. The spare parts are Oumoudan, which can be higher-end. I would give the overall score a 7.5. It is not a hotel that has been used for more than ten or twenty years, and the facilities and equipment are not in good condition.

msg:The environment is not as good as the antique hotel. You can ask for 2600 and I agree. But of the two rooms, one exhaust was broken and one socket was out of power. It took half an hour to repair, but the socket had power and the light switch failed. There is no apology for delaying the guests' night's rest. The slippers did not fit into men's size 44, so I complained three times before they were resolved. Such a good geographical and cultural environment is so carelessly managed.

Whether it is the staff at the door or the reception staff in the lobby, whenever I have needs, the staff will try their best to help, which is very heartwarming. Thank you for your meticulous and thoughtful service, and I look forward to seeing you next time.

msg:I come to Hangzhou for vacation several times a year. The hotels around the West Lake range from Lakeside Hyatt, Dahua on Nanshan Road, Liuyingli, Wangzhuang Xizi Hotel, Yanggongdi State Guesthouse, Four Seasons Hotel on West Lake, Huajia Villa in Shantai Yunshui, etc. Hotel, finally checked into the West Lake Villa and Xinxin Hotel on Beishan Road. During the Spring Festival, the whole family went out and booked a Dongzhuang Celebrity Family Suite with two bedrooms and one living room. My daughter was very satisfied and finally did not need to sleep in an extra bed. The room has double balconies on the third floor. Standing on the balcony of a more than 100-year-old building facing the beautiful scenery of the West Lake and recalling the past and thinking about the present, it feels like transcending time and space. The downside is that there is a bit of noise from the traffic on Beishan Road below, but closing the windows will make it much better. Xinxin Hotel is an old hotel, half of the history of the Republic of China. The front desk has appointed cultural ambassador Chen Bo to tell stories. Mr. Chen, a native of Hangzhou, wearing a long coat, leads everyone to visit the hotel and talks about the past and present, which is full of stories. He spoke for an hour and a half. The more I listen to it, the more I like it. In order to listen to Uncle Chen telling stories again, I will stay at this Shanghai-style cultural hotel again in the spring season soon!

I have stayed at Xizi Hotel, West Lake State Guesthouse, Dahua Hotel, and West Lake Villa before. This time I checked into Xinxin Hotel. It felt like my trip was worthwhile. The hotel in 1913 has a strong sense of history, with a simple and elegant decoration style. There are old objects everywhere, and there are many old photos that tell the story of the Xinxin Hotel’s past. Many famous people have stayed there. The most beautiful large terrace, sitting there with the West Lake in front of you. In winter, there are few leaves and the view is wide. The scenery is no worse than in other seasons. The room is small, and the style is truly classical. The wooden floor feels solid when you step on it. The carpet has exquisite patterns. The bed is the most comfortable. It has never been so comfortable. I don’t like it being too soft, it seems like a brown bed. The service is not good. The only drawback is that the breakfast is a bit simple, but it is enough for me.

But because of the old hotel, the sound insulation is really poor, and the bed creaks every time it is turned. If it weren't for being tired from playing during the day, I really wouldn't be able to sleep well at night like this. The hotel is full of history, but the beds still need to be replaced frequently. Overall, it's a five-star rating. It's very healing when you open the hotel lobby door and face the beautiful West Lake scenery.

Come with your parents and book a parent-child room in Hezhuang! The guy at the front desk said that the hotel only has this family room and it's on the sixth floor. You're really lucky to get it! The room area is a bit small, mainly because the design is very strange! But it is understandable that it is an old house renovated, but there are a few sockets in the room, and there is no USB socket! However, you can directly see Suti from the room, and there will be little squirrels appearing outside the window in the morning!
The breakfast is really surprising. All kinds of dim sum are carefully made freshly. The xiaolongbao and meat buns are full of soup and have solid meat fillings! Noodles and small wontons are also freshly cooked and delivered to the table! Sitting by the window in the morning, watching the beautiful scenery of the West Lake and eating a delicious breakfast, I was really satisfied and happy!
I really like this hotel and will choose this hotel next time I come to Hangzhou!

msg:A hotel with a story. I stayed at it for the second time this year. I wanted to see the beautiful scenery of the West Lake. This time I specially booked a suite facing the lake (Zanghui Hall). Unfortunately, the sycamore tree at the door was too tall. The West Lake was completely blocked by the sycamore leaves, so I could only sit. Drink tea and chat in the bedroom facing the balcony. The furniture in the hall is relatively nostalgic, and there is a note about "Zanghui Hall" when you enter the door. The Bose speaker in the bedroom couldn't find the switch anyway, so the maintenance staff came right away. It turned out that it was just a decoration. The TV couldn't be turned on either. It was later discovered that the socket on the back was loose. The air conditioner in the bedroom was very loud and would suddenly start up in the middle of the night. , was woken up... Some small details still need to be improved.

You can walk to the Broken Bridge and Baidi on the left. Going further, you can visit Pinghu Qiuyue, West Lake Museum, Zhejiang Museum, Xileng Seal Society, Gushan Park, and Beishan Street. It’s worth it. Take a look. Be sure to go early for breakfast. The location by the window is really a step away from the West Lake. You can eat slowly and enjoy the scenery.

You can go downstairs and walk around the lake at any time, it's so pleasant!
As soon as you enter the hotel lobby and room, the a**osphere of history hits your face. The elevator floor display is in the style of the 1920s and 1930s. The furniture in the room is all old and the sanitary facilities are all new. Therefore, living in it is still very comfortable. Because it is close to Beishan Street, there is some noise, but it is much better if the doors and windows are closed. The hotel also thoughtfully provided steam eye masks and earplugs, so I slept well. Room service is very warm. Breakfast is relatively simple, but it can meet the basic requirements. However, because the restaurant has to set up a table for lunch, people start to rush people at 10 o'clock. I feel a little uncomfortable, so I don't go to have breakfast for the next two days. The book bar and historical exhibition hall behind the lobby are worth a visit, showing the footprints of celebrities in the hotel. The living experience is overall very satisfactory.

I checked in at around three o'clock in the afternoon and opened the door. The generous amount of welcome fruits and a large portion of dried fruit mixed yogurt on the table comforted my hungry stomach in time. The store arranged and cleaned the room as per my request (I am a severe asthmatic, so this bedroom has clean floors instead of carpets, which is great). Outside the window is the West Lake. After taking a short rest, we began to quietly appreciate the architectural style (the first Baroque style building in Hangzhou) and interior furnishings of this century-old hotel. In an instant, you will calm down and be deeply attracted. It is an old hotel and half the history of the Republic of China! Hu Shi, Li Shutong, Feng Zikai...these shining names are all quantumly entangled with this hotel! …. Don’t forget to save a morning (starting at 9:30) to listen to Uncle Chen’s story telling! ~I originally thought I was just listening to a retired employee chattering... No spoilers, let's listen to it for yourself! In addition, the hotel's inner corridor leads directly to the rooftop bar. You can sit on a chair and order a drink. You will see the West Lake across the road and French chansons in your ears. Let's step back in time... (One suggestion: I hope the bedroom has a thin quilt instead of a thick one. duvet. It’s really too hot)

Xinxin should carefully read the bad reviews online. Hahaha. The location is unbeatable and the service is amazing! You can choose between younger and older omelette. When I told my family that the noodles were a bit salty, help me eat them. Help me make them again immediately.
I guess I put the energy into making the mini bar instead of fruit. Boil water and have baby water.
There is a bookstore and museum on the first floor. Bonus points.
If I have to choose, the mattress is relatively hard...definitely not as good as Sealy at Yihe Mansion (the service is 10,000 times better than Yihe Mansion)
The price of just over 1,000 is very good.

In terms of hotel comfort, the facilities are timeless, the service is courteous and thoughtful, the food and beverages are environmentally friendly and taste good, and the overall experience is over 5 stars. From a public point of view, I recommend Wall Crack; from a selfish point of view, I hope to maintain my personality and maintain the original cost-effectiveness.

I was honored to upgrade to a viewing room. When the windows and doors were opened, I could see the beautiful view of the Broken Bridge of the West Lake. It’s so happy to think that ordinary people today can stay in such high-standard hotels. The breakfast buffet is very rich, with both Chinese and Western items. It is well prepared and can satisfy a picky person like me (born as a chef). It is very good. After all, it is the skill of the old restaurant chef. Old-fashioned hotels have their own unique connotation and culture. It is worth staying in such a hotel, especially in a place where there is heaven above and Suzhou and Hangzhou below.

Secondly, there are lotus flowers just outside the hotel, and it is very convenient to walk to Broken Bridge and Gushan Park
The third is that the breakfast is right next to the floor-to-ceiling windows and you can see the lake view. You don’t need to go out to be crowded. It’s really friendly in summer.

One is that there are seasonal lotus pods in the welcome fruit, which are also very distinctive

msg:As a century-old hotel, the hotel really has a strong sense of history. It is a cultural relic in itself, very stylish. The hotel is on Beishan Street on the north shore of West Lake, and it is very close to the West Lake. The services at the front desk, guest room, and restaurant are all in place, the parking is convenient, and the minibar is also free. Because it was said in advance that it was the anniversary, the hotel also arranged the room layout and presented a cake. The breakfast is in the famous 1913 restaurant, which is very rich. It would be even more perfect if the hotel could maintain the slightly old facilities in the guest rooms better in accordance with the principle of repairing the old as the old. It is highly recommended for tourists who travel slowly in Hangzhou to stay.

With the old people and children staying in the Zhimo Room and the Meiling Room, they are named after famous works (Jade Lengcui, The Past Is Like Smoke). The hotel's location, scenery, service, environment, and check-in experience are excellent. The only regret is that the middle building was built in 1922. There are always some old problems in the old house, such as the sudden failure of the air conditioner and rusty water in the water pipes, but the hotel responded quickly. , the overall flaws are not concealed. Already looking forward to staying in the celebrity room next time, unlimited repurchase.

The hotel is full of the style of the Republic of China, and the guests all wear cheongsam to check in. The unique cultural tour in the store is led by Chen Bo, and you can fully visit the Guyun Cottage and Qiushui Manor except Dongzhuang and Hezhuang (unless you book more than 10,000 yuan for one night) , otherwise there would be no Chen Bo who would not be able to get in).
I also experienced the afternoon tea by the West Lake, which was very pleasant and beautiful. I hope to have the opportunity to try Chinese and French food again in the future, and experience the life of literati in the Republic of China.

msg:Room rates and hotel services did not meet expectations

It was raining lightly on the day I arrived at the hotel, and my disciples didn’t take the initiative to help me carry my luggage upstairs. It’s ok that you are a taxi driver who helped me carry it to the hotel entrance. I have never encountered such a service from a star hotel doorman.
Later, we left the hotel to visit the West Lake.
The doorman just blindly sells commercial vehicles and Zojirushi West Lake tickets,￼
The check-in staff at the front desk were not friendly, did not take the initiative to introduce the hotel, and did not ask if they needed children's supplies. All in all just no service.

Call the housekeeping to ask for extra supplies, and they will be delivered soon. The housekeeping staff is kind and courteous. ￼
The room is tidy, but unfortunately, there are small mosquitoes and other bugs in the whole bathroom. I took at least a dozen of them, and it feels unhygienic.

First-class scenery, you can see the West Lake from the terrace.
The buffet breakfast has many choices and tastes good. Eat breakfast by the West Lake.

The room was refurbished, but the wooden floor would make noise every time I walked on it. At night, I heard footsteps in the upstairs room, and the floor shook like an earthquake.

The only redeeming feature is that the location of the hotel is very good. It is very comfortable to walk to the Broken Bridge and Baidi, and to visit the West Lake after breakfast.

The 1913 restaurant is great, with many choices for breakfast and fresh ingredients. The coffee is of high quality, better than the ones I make at home. The special recommendation is Chen Bo telling stories at 9:30 in the morning, listening to Chen Bo's gossip about the old news of the Republic of China in Xinxin Hotel, I didn't expect it to be so good. (Suggested hotel 1) There is a storytelling adverti*****t of Chen Bo at the restaurant entrance/front desk 2. Uncle Chen’s storytelling time is controlled within 1 hour, too long for the elderly to stand up), otherwise it is easy to pass by.

Therefore, before the trip, I specially booked the Xinxin Hotel, which is right by the lake. The location of the hotel is excellent. It is very convenient to go to Gushan, Su Causeway and Bai Causeway.
For the elderly, they have seen mountains and rivers all their lives, and they have seen all kinds of scenery. It doesn't matter where you go. It is convenient to walk around, eat well, and live well is the most important thing.
In the circle of friends, my uncles and aunts wanted me to be the team leader.

I will not stay in hotels too much, so I chose Xinxin. I didn't have high expectations. But after checking in, it was much more than expected:
1. The service is professional and enthusiastic: it can reflect the background of the old five-star hotel and make people feel very comfortable.
2. The quality of supporting catering is high: the breakfast is great, the room is full of fragrant bread, there are small wontons that are freshly wrapped, and fresh seasonal fruits are delivered to the room every day.
3. The location is great: 30 meters in front of the door is the West Lake, you can see the Baidi in the restaurant, and you can go to the Botanical Garden, North Peak, Lingyin Temple and other scenic spots by riding for 10-30 minutes, and you can even go back to the hotel by a small battery car around the lake . The location of the hotel is on Beishan Street, with a strong historical heritage.
I may choose this hotel in the future, and the price is very high. I had a lot of fun traveling alone this time!

It has received countless celebrities such as Dewey, Xu Zhimo, Hu Shi, Soong Ching Ling, and Li Shutong. The hotel is full of the style of the Republic of China, and the furnishings inside can be compared to a small museum [强] You can see the snow on the broken bridge when you push the window, and the back garden is full of literary and artistic a**osphere, which makes people reluctant to leave [色]

The location of the hotel is also very good, between the Broken Bridge and Su Causeway, with historical and cultural buildings on both sides. The hotel facilities are also very user-friendly, the mattresses and pillows are the most comfortable I have ever slept on! The water pressure of the shower is moderate, and it was so comfortable to take a hot shower in the hotel after the cold wind blowing in the West Lake.

The hotel service is also very good and helped us upgrade the room. The hotel breakfast is also very rich, and the salmon steaks are delicious!

In short, I will do it again and again in the future!

msg:Overall, I am quite satisfied. Bonus points are given to the staff with a strong sense of service, and the sunrise over the broken bridge that can be realized just across the street.
Beishan Street is a disaster for holidays. It is so congested that you doubt your life. The key problem is that there are not many restaurants to choose from around. This is a big problem for families traveling on holidays. This time I booked 3 celebrity rooms, each of which has its own shortcomings, either without a TV or a bathtub, and there is also a special design, the wardrobe is designed behind the door. But the overall hotel is still comfortable, and it is a preferred hotel to avoid holidays.

msg:During the Spring Festival, I arrived at the hotel in the early morning, and I was exhausted. The curtain of the view room booked at a price of nearly 2,000 was broken. I didn’t fix it for a long time, so I simply tore the curtain, and then let us just live in it. Really drunk! After arguing with reason, I changed a room. After more than half an hour, I was really exhausted and had no sleepiness. The so-called landscape room is small and cramped, and the bathroom is also very cramped. There is a broken thatched roof outside the window. I am really dizzy. up! The waiter on duty surnamed Zhang swore that manager Lu on duty the next day would give an explanation, but there was no one there, and the hotel manager had to reflect.

msg:When you come to Hangzhou for a rest during the Spring Festival, Xinxin Hotel is the biggest surprise.
The location of the hotel is invincible. The West Lake is right outside the door. Get up early in the morning and take a walk along Beishan Street, and you can walk to Gushan in 10 minutes. On the fourth day of the ***** New Year when there are so many people, you can also get the beautiful view of the empty and quiet West Lake.
The room I stayed in was the Xizi Building Suite, which seemed to be a new type of room opened by the hotel in recent years. It was located in a small annex building between Dongzhuang and Qiushui Mountain Villa. The room is very new, decorated in a new Chinese style, with a record player, an old-fashioned telephone, a teapot and other delicate items, as well as a super rich fruit plate. The focus of the room is obviously the balcony of the bedroom. You can see the beautiful scenery of the West Lake and the lonely mountain under the shade of trees. In addition, the large terrace on the 7th floor of the main building is an excellent spot to overlook the panoramic view of the West Lake!
The breakfast is both Chinese and Western. The Chinese style prefers noodles, and the Western-style baking is very good. There is even a freshly fried steak.
Highly praise the hotel's service! Before I checked in, I was very worried about the parking problem. When I arrived at the hotel, I found that my brother worked very hard, and he could make a parking space for the hotel guests no matter what. When we checked in, we had to wait for the room due to the large number of people during the Spring Festival. The front desk gave us two cups of coffee and asked us to wait in the coffee shop in the lobby. The guy at the front desk is even more powerful. He carried all our luggage and led us to the room. Special thanks to Zhou Meng, the lady at the front desk. We accidentally left a charger behind.
Very satisfied with the whole trip! As a fan of Hu Shi, I hope to live in his celebrity room next time!
The last little suggestion is that it is best to add a lighted vanity mirror in the bathroom for the room type of Xizi Building. The current large mirror is combined with a screen. Although it is smart, the brightness is too low, making it more difficult to put on makeup.

The main focus is a sense of a**osphere. Chen Bo's storytelling is very good, which is the last bonus point item! It eased the experience of a family of three who had a relatively poor feeling about the room. Room 6217 is too small, and the bathroom and shower are together, which is very cramped.

msg:Give a very bad review to the lady staff who answered the phone at the front desk at around 3:30 pm on June 9th. The reason is as follows: As a hotel guest, a valuable ring was left on the sink of the hotel, and I wanted my aunt to check it for me. The feedback I got was that the item was not found, but my aunt saw that it was placed in the room during the cleaning the day before. The problem is that I was very sure that I took this ring out the day before yesterday when the auntie was cleaning the store, because I went to the mall to try on jewelry, and there were comparison ring models in the mall during the period, so the auntie was lying. But when the feedback was given to the front desk, the lady at the front desk answered the phone and said: You don't need to worry about this. The trash hasn't been dumped for you today. If you don't trust our hotel, you can come back and check. Very impatient and bad attitude. We chose to live here because of the brand and name of the hotel. Regardless of whether the items can be retrieved or not, such a service attitude is really a bad reputation.

msg:The overall experience is extremely poor:) I planned to stay for four days and stayed for two days and decided to change the hotel! Let me talk about the living experience first, I booked a suite in Xizi Building, the actual check-in is different from the decoration in the picture, the only mirror in the whole house is black It’s so flashy, you can’t put on makeup at all, the screen is on when the light is on, and the light is off when the screen is off. This control is really confusing. The only hair dryer plug in the bathroom is broken and it will fall off when you plug it in. If you need curly hair, I really listen to me. Thank you :) I want to put water to soak my feet. The water coming out of the bathtub is yellow, and the water leaks are also bad. I can’t step on it. The cleaning lady said that I need to press it a few times with my hands. I was very uncomfortable and wanted to change rooms. The front desk showed us a very arrogant face the whole time. We said we wanted to change the room on the picture of the Ctrip order and she said with a very bad attitude: "I don't understand what your needs are?? The room you live in It's also a suite in the Xizi Building, we don't specify a room for reservation." From the beginning to the end, she didn't ask where she was uncomfortable, and her mood throughout the day was ruined. Because of work needs, I have been out and staying in hotels all year round. My first bad review was sent to this front desk lady. If you don’t understand the needs of customers, please learn to listen. If you can’t adjust your mentality, please don’t ruin other people’s journeys by doing hotel work. . After the room change failed, the cleaning lady was very kind and helped us find the power ***** and cleaned the bathtub for us. Relais & Châteaux, which is very close to the hotel, is also a hotel with historical heritage. The experience is really different. It is not a deliberate stepping on a handful, but the real feeling of this trip.

Yes Too dedicated, or just finish this job and worry. I ordered a little Chinese food. I came back late because of the traffic jam. Just after one o’clock, I called and said that I couldn’t order food at 1:30. I asked if I could order it now, but said that I couldn’t order it without a table number. I was forced to ask if I could come back at 1:30. I had no choice but to tell them not to wait for us, because the traffic jam driver said it was hard to say. In short, the scenery in Hangzhou is good, and the hotel service is almost meaningless.

But the traffic is not very convenient, the surrounding area is relatively quiet, and there are no service stores
An old store is an old store, full of the taste of history
The service is also considered dedicated, but not worthy of praise
In particular, what needs to be named and criticized is the hygienic condition in the room
The quilt is relatively damp, the bath towel is hard and damaged
Dust has accumulated in the corners of the room
Stayed for two nights, but the guest room did not change the sheets, it was just a symbolic cleaning
Hotel afternoon tea is mediocre, not worth recommending
But the Chinese restaurant in the hotel is worth a try, the taste is really good
I ordered the food to be delivered to the room, it would feel better if it was in the restaurant

2. The glass windows are not one-way glass. If there are people in the room, you have to keep the curtains closed or you can see clearly
3. In the scenic area, it is very inconvenient to travel on weekends. It takes at least 20 minutes for the taxi driver to come over
4. I have to ask the front desk for the toiletry bag, but I asked the front desk for 2 days in a row. On the first day, I was given a toiletry bag and a toothbrush, and on the second day, I was given a toiletry bag. Would the front desk only give one? The front desk asked if I needed two? Why am I sharing a toothbrush or a shower cap with my friend?
5. The 1.5-meter double bed is very crowded, but only one pillow (buckwheat pillow➕softer pillow) is given to the reserved double room at the beginning

msg:I went to Hangzhou after New Year's Day. Because it was the off-season and the epidemic, Hangzhou was deserted and even the prices of Xinxin Hotel were so approachable. Before going to Hangzhou, I searched for at least 6 hotels and homestays. In the end, I chose Xinxin Hotel because of the superior geographical environment of the West Lake and the century-old history. I have to say that the service is very satisfactory. I feel that I may be the only or even the second guest on the day. When I arrived at the hotel in the evening, I found that my ID card was dropped on the taxi. The lady at the front desk (Miss Zhang) was very patient to help me find it. I got the driver, and helped me check in in advance, so that I would not sit in the lobby while waiting for the driver to return to send the ID card, and also chose a mountain view room for me, which was quiet and comfortable. Therefore, I decided to add another night. The next day, because of the cold weather, I suddenly wanted to take a bath, but the original mountain view room did not have a bathtub. The little brother at the front desk upgraded me to the "April Day on Earth" in the celebrity room again for free. It is said that Lin Huiyin once stayed at the Xinxin Hotel, so he The room gets its name. The room is decorated in the style of the Republic of China, the bathtub and bath are in retro style, and there are two retro small balconies with a view of the West Lake. During my stay, I ordered takeout twice, and the front desk would take it upstairs for me responsibly, and all the service staff were very considerate and polite. Hopefully, such a home-like service can continue during the peak tourist season. But the standard of the restaurant is very sloppy, probably because it is close to the West Lake, this superior location has become the strongest competitive advantage, so in my opinion, the dishes are just a little better than most tourist restaurants on Beishan Road. It's the sight, not the taste.

Knowing that I like to drink orange juice, I just sat down the next morning and immediately handed over a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice. This detail is definitely super five-star~~
Next time I have a chance, I must go and listen to Uncle Chen telling the history and humanistic stories here. It is definitely worth listening to...

It is the biggest feature of Xinxin Hotel. Unfortunately, because I have to go home in the afternoon, I only listened to the morning part. Next time I go to Hangzhou, I would like to choose Xinxin Hotel. Continue with Uncle Chen about Xinxin Hotel. The past of the hotel!

msg:I stayed in the family room of Xinxin Hotel for a few days in Hangzhou with my parents. It is located in the Baroque architectural style of the Republic of China on Beishan Street. The whole building has seven floors, and our room is on the sixth floor. There are beautiful scenery outside the window, and Lixi Lake is across the road from the hotel. The environment is first-rate, and I personally feel that the location is better than Shangri-La.
The decoration style of the hotel rooms is also retro and full of style, and it feels warm and warm. I praised the hotel’s breakfast and service, and my parents also praised the Xinxin Hotel. This is definitely the best choice for our family to visit Hangzhou again!

I chose the lake-view room, room 2618, which was awesome, and a view of the West Lake landscape through the window The beautiful scenery greets your eyes, and it is beautiful. I recommend the hotel's seventh floor terrace, which has a panoramic view of the West Lake. Come again next time. Picture 1 The window of the room sees the beautiful view of West Lake.

Ancient and elegant, luxurious and low-key, Hu Shi, Xu Zhimo, Ba Jin, Lu Xun, Lin Huiyin, Zhang Ailing, Jiang Gong and many other cultural celebrities and literati have stayed here and spent an unforgettable time.
In addition to the profound cultural heritage, high-quality service and comfortable living environment, the most unforgettable thing is to listen to Bogu Tongjin's Uncle Chen, who talks about the past and present of the hotel, celebrity anecdotes, unfortunately because of the hurry, looking forward to it. Next time I will continue to listen to Uncle Chen telling the story.

msg:After staying in so many hotels, this is the first time I have received a negative review. Checked into the standard room on November 1st, and had a meal in the Hongyu private room at noon the next day. When I wanted to go home, I found that the top of the car was stuck with cement. The manager on duty said it was easy, just add some glass water to the rag and wipe it off. We were skeptical. , and then he said that he was the one who cleaned their CEO Xu’s car the day before yesterday. But if I parked my car overnight, it would definitely not be wiped off. The more he rubbed it, the more it became worn. I asked him to stop, but he kept wiping it hard. It must be a new car. Without cleaning, the paint was completely ruined. They bluntly said that this was alkaline water dripping from the cement, so such a large hotel had already discovered the problem but did not solve it. The manager on duty went back and forth for half an hour, asking for instructions, understanding, and informing me. Anyway, he just said, "No problem." He repeatedly told me that he had cleaned Mr. Xu's car. Finally, they are state-owned enterprises and everything is done according to procedures. Either upgrade my room next time I come to stay, or apply for afternoon tea for me. I heard it was so funny. First of all, if this happens this time, will I stay here again next time? Help me apply for afternoon tea, are you helping me? It's not the fault of the guy who handled it. There should be a problem with the entire hotel management. The management of such a large hotel is really inadequate. Large-scale corrosive alkaline water has been dripping for so many days. It has been discovered long ago. Although no one came to care or ask questions, no one came to deal with it at all. It’s time for hotel management to reflect. 🔟On the 2nd of March, I dined in a private room at noon. I saw only scattered guests. Even the private room was empty on the second day of National Day. Is this still the beautiful Xinxin in my mind? Apparently not anymore. We were exposed to the scorching sun for more than 40 minutes. Your manager thought we were here for an afternoon tea and a room upgrade. Obviously, Xinxin Hotel put the cart before the horse. We are guests, and we have to talk about the same thing. If the car is damaged, we I need a minimum of respect and an apology from you. But I didn't get any apology or respect, and in the end I was hurt. What I want to say in the end is that you are a state-owned enterprise, but you can't bully your customers. A century-old hotel cannot be ruined by your so-called state-owned enterprise management. inside. I guess you don’t need us ordinary customers, but if your reputation is ruined among ordinary customers, what prestige and reputation do you still have? A hundred years of history is not yours, it is history, culture, and inheritance, and it cannot be destroyed in your hands. I speak softly and speak out truthfully when it comes to injustices.

Compared with many hotels of the same grade or even more expensive, I think the decoration of Xinxin Hotel is the most beautiful, classical It is elegant, luxurious and not exaggerated. It has a long history but the furnishings are very new and tasteful. I really like this style. The key is that the room is really clean. I am a little sensitive to the hotel environment. If the environment and the bedding are not clean, I will get allergic and itchy, but the room in the new hotel is really clean and comfortable. This time I will take a bath. In addition to the rooms with bathtubs, the bathtubs are also very clean and it is very comfortable to take a bath every day. The hotel service is also meticulous. The waiter will greet you when you meet, help open the door, take your luggage, and when you see us appear, he will help press the elevator, and then bow and watch us upstairs. From time to time, I will ask if the stay is comfortable and how it feels. I will ask the courier. At the counter location, the waitress took me directly. Every employee gives me a very comfortable feeling. I really love it here. Currently my favorite hotel

msg:The humidity in Hangzhou in mid-August is very high, and the daytime travel is sultry and unbearable. The stay at Xinxin Hotel is short but comfortable. The 103-year-old building and the superior geographical location give a unique feeling from both the humanities and the landscape. I stayed in a garden-view double room on the 4th floor. The space was not large and the layout was very careful. Living in the "old house" was most worried about the obsolescence and inconvenience of the facilities, but the new hotel did not have this situation at all. Room details such as enough power plugs, Kohler basins, Panasonic bidet, bright light *****s (this is very important), table and chair layout are very new, it can be considered to retain the flavor of the Republic of China, while taking care of the warmth of the details. The staff of the hotel will take the initiative to help push the luggage into the room, especially when he reminds the 7th floor of the landscape platform, the outdoor is sultry and hot, but the view is definitely worth watching. When I left the store, I asked us for advice. I didn't think about it at the time. Now I suggest replacing the hair dryer. The current one is not very easy to use. This is not a flaw, but it can improve the check-in experience!

The location is excellent, opposite to the West Lake, you can see the beautiful scenery of West Lake through the floor-to-ceiling windows of the hotel lobby and restaurant, which is great. Inside the hotel is a small museum. Every day there is a special project "Uncle Chen tells stories". The humorous and elegant Uncle Chen explains to us the history of the hotel and the stories of celebrities in the Republic of China. The children listened very carefully and learned a lot of knowledge. This time I brought my children to Hangzhou, because I stayed in this hotel, which made the whole trip especially perfect. I will definitely stay again next time I come to West Lake.

I never thought that because of some small episodes, I upgraded to the celebrity room, which is Hu Shi’s room 403... After checking in, there is a special hotel that is decent. Uncle took me upstairs. It should be a mezzanine building built in the 1920s. As the elevator went up, he explained some new and new history to me. It was really profound! On the 4th floor, I introduced the celebrities who lived in each room~ An experience I have never had before. It is indescribable. The layout of the room was renovated after G20, but I can still feel the a**osphere of the talented era, literati and guest. ! Open the balcony door opposite to Beishan Road and West Lake. It’s the first time to live next to the West Lake. If you’re not excited, it’s a lie.

msg:陪外地同學即興小遊，西子賓館有點貴，同學本來考慮西湖邊另一家著名五星酒店，在當地工作的女生（非本地人）説該酒店風水不好、陰氣重，遂推薦了新新飯店。是古色古香、中西合璧的老飯店，到處鋪着地毯、掛着些民國舊照片。位於北山路，離斷橋不遠。酒店一樓有家1913餐廳，是否意味着酒店1913年開業未考證。翌日中午想在餐廳吃飯，沒位置，衹好去了另一家五星酒店的餐廳。酒店本身除了設施有些舊，無可挑剔。房間帶陽台，左側可見西湖一角，被濃密的法國梧桐樹葉遮蔽，但可看到一點點波光。並不寬闊的北山路車水馬龍，自行車與機動車混行，湖畔有中老年女士旗袍隊在擺拍，不知哪裡的音響（樂隊）大聲放着（彈奏）美國老歌。陽台下是家法國餐館，但午後才開始營業。房間寬敞、應有盡有，歡迎水果有好幾種包括稀有熱帶水果，一人一天吃不完。比較別緻的是卧室一角靠近陽台門處有個舊式浴缸，還有小台板，上面放着各種沐浴用品，好像還有浴鹽（象香皂，沒用過）。如果同行女伴在泡澡、你坐在對面沙發上舉杯欣賞，當是一種美妙的風景哈哈。打開陽台門躺在床上看樹影、玩手機、聽人聲和外面的音樂，也是一種獨特的享受。翌日晨才找到床頭插座，牀頭櫃抽屜把手往下拉開（而不是抽出來）就是，有點隱蔽。

餐廳1913年開的，西湖醋魚是我想象中的味道，菜品有來由，味道考究。配上加熱薑絲話梅黃酒，魚鮮味更勝。

The welcome fruit has been prepared in the room, and a trace of coolness emerges spontaneously. Choosing Xinxin Hotel, firstly, the hotel has a long history, and celebrities and elegant scholars have stayed there; secondly, the location is very convenient, facing the West Lake, and you can stroll by the lake at any time, especially when the lotus is in full bloom, you will see "the endless green lotus leaves in the sky" in front of you. ", there is the No. 7 bus at the door, and it is also very convenient to go to Lingyin Temple (terminus), Quyuan Fenghe, and Yuewang Temple are also very close. The layout of the hotel is more exquisite, the kettle and the storage box are different from the previous hotels, and the daily fresh language milk is thoughtfully prepared at night. There are many books in the lobby, accompanied by the fragrance of lilies, the cultural heritage and romantic a**osphere quietly permeate. The breakfast is clean, rich, and more Western-style. Of course, there are noodles and wontons. I had dinner at the restaurant of the hotel. Personally, the taste was a little salty, and the price was a little expensive. The hotel is on Beishan Street, the bustling road is easy to be congested, and there are few parking spaces. All in all, I am quite satisfied with my stay this time. It is in line with the reasons for my choice. There should be a next time.

眼前走來一位頭戴棕色禮帽，身穿灰布長衫的紳士，這是飯店特聘的講解員陳伯老師。若不是他的介紹，你絕對想不到這家飯店曾擁有怎樣的非凡經歷。
長話短説，這裏曾住過魯迅、胡適、徐志摩、宋美齡、李叔同、竺可楨、張愛玲、巴金……這份名單太長了，可以説幾乎一半的名國曆史人物都在此下榻過。今天，飯店房間仍以他們的作品命名，比如魯迅住過的叫百草園，張愛玲叫傾城戀，林徽因叫四月天。名人來而又往，雪泥鴻爪，他們的故事永留傳。
陳老師就是這樣一位講故事的人，他娓娓道來，引人入勝。別看陳老師一身民國範，鬍鬚已白，其實小我一歲，剛退休。我們相聊甚歡……
新新飯店位於北山街58號，面湖依山，出門就是西子湖，大片的荷花迎風搖曳，氣勢壯觀，正是宋詩“接天蓮葉無窮碧，映日荷花別樣紅”的畫面。我忽然想到，天然風光+文化底藴=永恆魅力。西湖如此，新新飯店亦如此。

msg:北山街在環西湖圈屬於比較安靜的區域，因為都是民國時期的老宅子，基本沒有沿街商鋪。新新的服務很不錯，湖濱房可以透過窗户看到西湖。房間打掃的很乾凈，房間面積不大，但濃郁的民國氛圍給人感覺很舒適。衞浴設備是科勒的，但不足的就是噴淋一直垂頭（噴頭重，鎖不住方向，一直下垂了），還有浴缸的噴淋頭沒研究出來怎麼抽出來。早飯以中式點心為主，品種也很豐富，味道很好。整體非常推薦，西湖邊安靜又有氛圍的酒店。

地段、裝修，房內用品，以及該店所固有的歷史故事都讓我不由讚許👍
我要説的是一樓的餐廳的菜餚和服務真可謂上佳！入住本酒店一定要裏面用嚐嚐裏面的菜品，最好事先預訂一個靠西湖邊的位置，一邊品味，一邊眺望，一邊聊天，真美爽了。

房間總體還是開闊明亮的。

服務：尚可，有提升空間。到房間這要走兩段樓梯，服務人員沒有意識幫忙拿行李，也沒有告知這段路沒有點電梯的。客房服務有時反應不是很迅速。

總體來説，商務出行會再選擇這裏的。

設施：2020新裝修的，該有的都有了，軟件還可以
衞生：衞生狀況堪憂，房間裏時不時就有小蟲爬來爬去，想喝個膠囊咖啡，居然在蓄水的時候發現蓄水壺裡有好幾衹小蟲飄在上面，可想而知不是每次客人使用完房間都清洗。衞生間還會發現一衹小強🪳，讓人震驚，當然由於爬了太快也沒有拍照留證。
環境：民國風的環境讓人感覺和西湖相當搭配，坐在1913餐廳裏吃早餐也是相當的享受
服務：一共住了兩晚，房間裏的飲料和牛奶應該是每日補足，我就看到第一晚的飲料和牛奶，第二晚是由於朋友來探望想泡杯咖啡發現沒有牛奶，要求前台幫忙送一瓶牛奶，他們告知要和送水果的一起補，當然補送的時候也就送了一瓶牛奶，飲料也沒有看見再補，這些應該是服務上的一些小細節，雖然沒有多少錢，但是客户的體驗度不是很好，希望改善！

房間不大，但夠用。
服務很好，餐廳是米其林推薦，早餐早點去有臨窗位可看湖景，午餐晚餐最好提前預訂。

衞生：乾淨整潔，沒毛病。
環境：內部磚木結構，很舒服。正對西湖，出門見平湖。左邊是斷橋殘雪，右邊是白堤，正對面是樓外樓。
服務：剛來想多看兩間不同房間，前台小姐姐不厭其煩地帶我們看了所有空的名人房，贊一個。

msg:環境：就在西湖邊，除了面對馬路有一點點吵、基本上是很安靜的。入住主要是體驗歷史文化風情。套餐價非常划算。雖然這間房沒有浴缸，但有個大陽台也很不錯。

設施：智能馬桶有個問題就是每次走過去它就自動打開，過了一會兒又要自動關閉。不上洗手間也這樣開開合合其實就挺不智能的，畢竟洗手間並沒有那麼大。還有就是老房子的排水問題，樓上洗澡能聽到渠道流水的聲音。

服務：總的來説很不錯，入住離開服務員都有幫忙拿行李。表情嚴肅應該是和酒店定位有關吧，覺得還好。每天都有果盤和牛奶，很有誠意。早餐每天都一樣，很標準化，但沒有什麼驚喜。但外面的景色是無可挑剔的。

不知為什麼房間沒放酸奶，前台説給問問之後也沒了動靜。打電話要一床被子讓我從櫃子裏找，問哪個櫃子直接説不知道，後來連小格子都翻了也沒有再次打電話要來的。因為總體喜歡還是五分吧，暇不掩瑜。

早餐在1913餐廳，環境好，早餐不錯。

房間裝修一般，尤其是壁紙、燈箱、軟裝，總感覺質感差了些，衞生間的部分還可以，特製的浴袍算是驚喜點。

由於入住晚，房間看不到湖景，而且一開小陽台的門就對着隔壁樓的窗户，互相可以看得很清楚……

早餐還行吧，葱油拌麪有點太鹹了有點比不上高中食堂的……

最不滿意的：1k+的房間有北鼎的熱水壺卻沒有咖啡機，衹有兩條糖兑植脂末的雀巢咖啡；酒店門口上下車沒人幫忙提行李或者開車門，站在門口的服務人員沒啥服務意識，屬於直接無視客人哈

關於陳伯講故事：每天都有，昨天還早午兩場。不需預約和付費，住店客人按時到酒店大堂，新新飯店文化大使陳伯就在那候着。陳伯好像個很厲害的歷史老師，信手拈來隨時發散一大串正史野史花邊八卦，願意與聽者互動，看着有昨天聽過的遊客會講不一樣的故事，説能保證三天之內不重樣。

服務稍微差強人意一些，住宿期間落下一件小物品，電話確認可以次日去前台拿，結果第二天去了等了很久也沒找到，這個對於這樣價格的酒店實屬不應該。東西不貴重，衹是這樣白跑白等感覺很不好。

msg:是很喜歡的酒店，幾乎是每年刷一次不同房型。
然而這次不住在主樓，感受到了幾個或許可以提升的地方：wifi信號偏弱、淋浴間水温偏低、沙發與牆壁之間卡了一個上任住客的瓶蓋、地燈旁有一衹去世的小昆蟲、地板每天都不吸、打掃房間的時候容易被忽視（因為不是主樓嘛）從而需要主動致電。
這個事情講出來的憑據是，當日我被問到幾點合適打掃房間，我説可不可以我在離開房間的時候把需要打掃房間的提示燈打開這樣，但工作人員説因為不是主樓所以也不會那麼頻繁查看，建議還是在我需要打掃房間的時候致電。雖然是小事，但是還是有點點像是不受關注的小偏樓誒hhh
因為不是連鎖酒店所以有些隨意和閑適的服務態度和行為一直都沒怎麼影響我喜歡它，反而覺得很真實很本土很有親和力哈哈哈
服務態度依舊很好，早餐也發揮穩定，明年去的話大概還會選擇住在主樓吧～
喜歡杭州一萬年！

🧹衞生：衞生85分吧，住的房間牆紙有些發黴了，然後我看茶几上也還有灰塵，不過總體來説還可以
🍃環境：環境是OK 的，畢竟我覺得這個酒店這個價位其實是賣它的地理位置和環境，但是實話實説新新飯店有點太雜了，又是餐廳，又是住宿，又是咖啡廳的，我個人喜歡安靜一點
🔔服務：每天有送水果和酸奶，有需求也基本能解決
總體來説尚可，但是應該不會住第二次，畢竟這個價位可以住更好的酒店了，新新飯店要不是在湖邊，我衹接受500多的價位吧……而且就算在湖邊，我也不怎麼看得到湖吧説實話……以後應該不會訂在湖邊的酒店了

msg:杭州最具歷史的五星酒店
如果説，魔都最具歷史感的酒店是上海和平飯店，那麼，在杭州，最具歷史的便是新新飯店了。

新新飯店始於1913年，是浙江省至今唯一存世的百年酒店。酒店位於杭州市景區北山路上，背靠保俶山，面對西湖，在百年歷史中是政要和文人墨客的下榻落腳地～

★交通出行
1. 打車
2.自駕（有停車場）
3.公交7路和27路到“新新飯店”站，或“葛嶺”站，再走幾步就到
4.騎行（推薦租車騎行）

★服務體驗
首先，門衞就讓人很暖心。我選擇了騎行，到了門口，我告知門衞我要辦理入住，門衞非常禮貌耐心地幫我停好自行車，還幫我鎖好車。然後指引辦理入住。絲毫沒有因為我是騎行而至，就待遇不佳。入內，前台小姐姐也是禮貌而周到，辦理好入住，把客人送至電梯，按好樓層，才退出。這一點，真的是跟和平飯店很一致，必須點贊（城中香格里拉也是這個待遇）

★房間體驗
飯店極具年代，前身是新新旅館，所以大床房相對現代的酒店，顯得有些小。但是層高還是很令人滿意的。房間內，很乾凈，應了那句話：麻雀雖小，五臟俱全。 現場很有歷史沉浸感，視覺感也是很不錯的，比照片看上去好多了～

強烈推薦給喜歡古董樓、年代感的小夥伴。

1913餐廳的菜也不錯。到達的當天就嘗過了。做的比較精緻。很好吃。

我個人很喜歡這種富有文化氣息的精緻的酒店。

之前看評論説有個別服務員會看人下菜，很不幸，我也遇到了。我家孩子個子高，想試一下旗袍，結果那個服務員各種推脱，非常不情願。意思是我們不可能買，不要白*她。

我很生氣。從入住到見到這個服務員之前，對新新各方面包括入住、行李、房間、晚餐都很滿意。酒店付給這位服務員的工資裏，包含了她對客人試穿的職責。我不想這種服務人員對存在，影響客人對新新的印象。於是立即向大堂經理投訴了這位敷衍的服務人員。

姓鄧的大堂經理立即對該員工進行了教育。並且送了蛋糕到我們房間致歉。（新新的蛋糕做的很好吃，住店的客人一定要嘗一嘗）

本來我們很生氣，但是酒店管理層進行了快速的反應，可見新新對服務質量還是非常重視的。

祝新新越辦越好！

msg:服務配不上價格 提高一下服務人員培訓吧 酒店那個牆真的….好簡陋 ！一堆服務人員還是辦公人員走來走去 還有在那裡裝修…
旁邊餐廳服務員不讓拍照真的會謝 酒店住客拍拍照拍得久一點都不行？旁邊網紅帶了一大袋衣服來隨便拍呵呵了 在草坪上根本就沒人…請問你們是五星級酒店嗎 還是博物館？賣這個價格良心不會痛嗎 前台衹有一個服務人員 和第二天去的酒店一個天上一個地下 體驗感真的非常差！！
