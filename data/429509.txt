msg:Our hotel stay was fantastic. Located next to a mall with plenty of food eateries. Hotel is about 600m walking distance to the nearest train station. 

We had booked the family room that came with 2 double beds. Room was big and clean. Hotel staffs were friendly and helpful, and always willing to lend a hand whenever we needed help with finding locations, recommending places to visit or making reservations.

Kudos to hotel manager 谢永旺 and room maintenance staffs  史沁棉 and 胡文霞.

Very comfortable stay at the hotel.The front desk and other staff are very friendly and helpful even though they do not speak much English. Rooms are very spacious and clean and housekeeping is done daily. The hotel is conveniently located within the Joy Mall and has numerous restaurants to enjoy some great meals or do some leisurely shopping. The hotel is also centrally located so it's easy to get to the nearby tourist attractions like Tiananmen Square, the Forbidden Palace etc. Will definitely stay at this hotel the next time I visit Beijing.

Everything is just awesome, my wife and kids love the family friendly room and especially the room service ladies in 12th floor (specially shout out xiao wei yuan) exhibited the epitome of best customer service in hospitality industry, they patiently explain how the self laundry service is operating and volunteerily offer other equipments that ease the clothes washing and drying experience. The location is awesome too, the pick up point is crystal clear for ehailing services for most activities consider Beijing is a collosal city and we also enjoy walking around the vicinity for food, shopping and entertainment. If I am having the opportunity to visit Beijing again, Le Joy is definitely one of my top choices.

A little extravagant, an executive room! 

Location and transportation: 
Along Chang'an Avenue, in the Xidan business district, the status strength can be imagined 

Room view: 
The executive room is high-end! Although the window can't be opened and the glass is a bit blurry, the view is good! The layout of the small suite is quite good inside~ I like the bed, very comfortable~ 

Parking: 
There is a parking lot, but you need to pay the fare yourself, which is charged by the hour, which is not cheap! Why can't guests staying in the hotel have a discount... 

The front desk brother Shuo Shuo is very enthusiastic! The service is very thoughtful~ I like to order takeout, and he also asked the courier to put it in the robot and deliver it upstairs

It’s very convenient for a little shopping and ordering takeout. The hotel should be in a minimalist style, the rooms are quite large, and the environment is fairly clean. The mattress is average, neither soft nor hard. The soundproofing of the door is average, and you can hear people passing by the door. The lobby ceiling is made of glass, so the temperature in the lobby is now higher than indoors, but the temperature at the end of April is just right.

It takes about 20 minutes to take a taxi from the train station to the hotel without traffic jams. It only takes ten minutes to ride a bicycle from the hotel to Tiananmen Square. If you choose to take the subway, you can walk for about ten minutes to the subway station, which is only two stops away. There are many restaurants near the hotel, which is convenient for dining with children. Needless to say about hygiene, it is neat, clean and cleaned in a timely manner, impeccable.

msg:This time, I chose Beijing Joy City Hotel for my trip to downtown Beijing. It turned out to be a wise choice.
Environment: It is located at the intersection of Metro Line 1 and Line 4, on the upper floor of Joy City Shopping Mall, and there are shopping malls next to and opposite. It is very convenient to go to the city attractions. There are too many popular restaurants, beverage shops, and snacks. You can eat whatever you want. The elevator on the 6th floor of the mall can go directly to the guest room floor. The hotel environment is fashionable and comfortable.

Facilities: The room area is much larger than that of hotels of the same price. This is also a key consideration for parent-child travel for 4 consecutive nights. The facilities are high-end and can fully meet the needs of ordinary travel.

Hygiene: Clean and hygienic, cleaned and tidied every day.

Service: The service attitude is very good. The viewing room was upgraded when checking in. In April, the heating was still unified. After checking in, I felt that the indoor heating was too stuffy and dry. People from the south were extremely uncomfortable. I called to communicate and the fan was immediately sent. Seeing that there were children, they also took the initiative to provide multiple bottles of water.

msg:Not recommended for stay:
1. The door is behind Joy City. It is difficult to find it for the first time. After all, the street environment behind it is chaotic and there are only bicycles and electric cars;
2. The room is quite clean and tidy. There is a smell of burnt wires when using the humidifier. The air filter is well received. The air conditioner has no cold air and is very stuffy. There is no ventilation window. The overall service experience is average;
3. Viewing room, but the room is at the back of Joy City and has no view.
4. The breakfast in the hotel is too mediocre. The food is clean and fresh, but the price/performance ratio is very poor. You don’t need to choose breakfast.
5. The soundproofing of the hotel is poor, and the excited chatter next door can be heard, but it is not loud noises and fights.

It's less than 1,200 a night, but it feels like the price is over 600. I still recommend you stay in a mid-to-high-end brand chain hotel. The service will be better and the breakfast will be better.

My own living experience was not good.
There are also many neighboring hotels nearby, so I suggest you compare them.

The advantage is that it is connected to the first and sixth floors of Joy City Mall and can be passed directly.

The most important thing is that this hotel has good equipment and good service. I am very satisfied every time! GRO Xiaozhan's service is also very good. When I checked in, I may have met a new employee who was not very skilled, and I was very anxious and impatient. Thanks to her coordination, she upgraded me! On the second day, I heard that I didn’t sleep well, so I brought a lot of pillows for me, but I was worried that I would put a lot of mineral water on them. Details determine success or failure. I will stay here again next time.

The hotel is located in the city center with convenient transportation, beautiful surroundings and close to many famous tourist attractions. From the moment you enter the lobby, you can feel the enthusiasm and professionalism of the hotel staff. The check-in process is very fast and makes people feel very welcome.

The design of the room is modern and comfortable, equipped with high-quality bedding and advanced facilities, ensuring a good sleep quality during my stay. The room is very clean and every detail is taken care of to make you feel at home.

All in all, my stay at Beijing Joy Hotel exceeded my expectations. Whether it was in terms of facilities, services or overall a**osphere, it was a highly recommended stay. I will definitely stay here again on future trips and recommend this hotel to friends and family.

advantage 
First, convenient transportation, close to Xidan subway station
Second, it’s right behind the Joy City shopping mall, a quiet place amidst the hustle and bustle.
areas for improvement
First, the service is average. Although the waiter seems to be working hard, it is still quite confusing.
Secondly, I ordered the hotel's own dumplings. It said 38 yuan for delivery to the room. But after it was delivered, I was charged a delivery fee of 5.7 yuan. I was puzzled. I took the elevator downstairs from the hotel restaurant and took it to the room. It was charged. Is 5.7 yuan a slap in the face to the hard-working delivery boys and delivery boys?
Third, the room is small and the facilities are simple. It is at the level of a fast hotel but the price of a five-star hotel.
Fourth, the refrigerator is still locked and no one is allowed to use it. It is said to be for the safety of customers. We all know the real reason and understand it.
Fifth, there is no view outside the window. They are all facing the wind turbine unit. Please be careful if you mind.
In short, this hotel is a trap. The price is high, but the overall hardware or software of the hotel is not worthy of the price. I will definitely not consider this hotel next time.

The room is also very large, there is a humidifier inside so it won't dry out, and the heating is sufficient. There are many shopping malls nearby and eating is more convenient. But when I booked, I made a note about arranging adjacent rooms and called to confirm. When I checked in, I was told that there were no adjacent rooms and they were still very far away. I checked out late and checked with the front desk to see if the room card could be opened. Then I went up and couldn't open the door and then went back down to swipe the room card. I didn't have a good impression of this aspect and was even locked in the elevator once.

msg:This is my third time staying at Joy Hotel. I like this hotel very much! The location is convenient for eating, drinking and having fun, so I won’t say more! What I particularly care about when staying in a hotel is the cleanliness and service!
The first thing I must talk about is service. A lot of things happened this time, which fully reflects the hotel's service-oriented business philosophy!
I was very impressed with the overall service of the hotel from the front desk to concierge catering and even the administration.
1. From employees to managers, the hotel can communicate and adjust policies in a timely manner based on guests' special circumstances to maximize guest convenience and consider guests!
2. Because my child was doing homework, I lost control in the hotel and turned on Hedong Lion Roar. In less than 2 minutes, I received a call from the hotel front desk asking if I needed help? This hotel immediately made me feel safe!
3. My child and I were carrying four luggages. Because we were in a hurry to go out, we didn’t ask the concierge to help us with our luggage. As a result, an administrative employee of the hotel saw us and helped us carry our luggage to the car.
4. My children and I rarely use hotel towels in hotels. Even the bedding in five-star hotels sometimes makes us uncomfortable and itchy. But at Dayue, we can use it with confidence and feel clean. breath!

After taking the room card and going upstairs to the room, a strong smell of decoration hit my nostrils and I couldn't bear it. When I fell asleep at night, I could clearly hear the noise in the next room, especially in the corridor, but I still tolerated it. There are very few choices for breakfast. The fried noodles and fried rice are not very tasty. Only the fried eggs are good. The coffee is very tasteless. I will continue to tolerate it. Something I couldn't bear came. It rained heavily in Beijing on May 25. I came from out of town on a business trip and didn't bring an umbrella. I went to the concierge desk to borrow one. The waiter looked indifferent and said: There is no umbrella. I went to the lobby manager and asked, can’t it be justified that the hotel has run out of umbrellas? He asked people to look for it again but still couldn't find it. Since my friend who picked me up had already arrived, I had no choice but to rush out and get in the car in the rain. The experience was so bad, I will never choose this hotel again!

- [1️⃣] The room card can be pressed by the floor in the elevator, but after reaching the floor where you live, the room door cannot be opened. It is not the wrong card sound, but there is no sound response. I thought we got the wrong one, but There should also be a sound for the wrong card! No!
- [2️⃣] We returned to the elevator room to find a phone to call the front desk, but there was no phone.
- [3️⃣] Fortunately, I saw a staff member. I said that our room card was invalid and the door could not be opened, but the service staff told me very casually, go to the first floor and find the front desk! We are near the top floor, and we are tired from the day. We chose to contact the front desk by phone!
- [4️⃣] We used our own phone to find the front desk number at Volkswagen and Ctrip. The front desk told me, wait a minute, I will make a ticket for the robot to deliver, then hung up the phone, and there was a long wait. I know it would be faster if I took the elevator down from the top floor, but I just wanted to see how rubbish the service in this hotel can be! Live up to expectations!
- [5️⃣] During the long wait, an even more amazing thing happened! I took the used room card and looked around at the door. I remembered the test on the Internet about testing the safety of hotel room doors, so I took the used room card and followed the crack in the door to try to open the door. As expected, I opened the door smoothly. . I was so surprised at that time that I really couldn’t hold it in any longer! My husband and I had already entered through our own efforts before the robot that delivered the keys arrived! this**!
- [6️⃣] I thought this bloody thing should be over, but I didn’t expect that there is still more! Hahahaha, wonderful. I was tired when I came back, so I took a short rest. Suddenly all the lights went out, yes, all of them, even the TV and the night light were turned off, and the air conditioner was also turned off. It was obviously a power outage! All the lights came on after about fifteen seconds of power supply. Since we were just resting, we didn't realize the seriousness of the problem, so it was time to do something. In the next hour and a half, the room repeated this power outage process four times! When it’s dark, it’s so dark that you can’t even see your fingers! So I experienced that I couldn't see my fingers in the shower, and couldn't see my fingers on the toilet. etc! Of course, we also contacted the front desk during this process, and the manager on duty was very cooperative and gave us two options: either ask the engineering staff to repair it, or you can change the room! We asked the engineering staff to come and take a look. After all, we didn’t want to pack our bags and change rooms in the middle of the night! The result was still ineffective, so we decided to turn off the lights and go to sleep. Only then did we realize that we couldn't sleep at all, because when the power went out, we only had darkness, but when the power came on, the whole house was lit! ! ! It was already three o'clock when our eyes met!
Finally, thanks to the above experience, we were assigned to a suite at the far end of the same floor! In this room, the curtains cannot be closed, and the lights must be turned off by the main switch, but at least the lights in the whole house will not suddenly turn on! It's time to sleep!
The next day, it wasn't until around 12 o'clock that I went to the front desk to tell me that I would check out a little later. The front desk manager on duty asked me if I was sorry and could I not give a bad review. It was really amazing. Let's not talk about how to solve yesterday's problem. First ask if you can not give a bad review! During the communication process, a manager passed by twice and looked at each other before bowing his head and leaving. It can be seen that the management also had this muddled attitude towards the problems encountered this time! Finally, I came forward and expressed my dissatisfaction and did not want to communicate with her any more. I also explained that I would report the situation to the leader and see how to solve it. Funny, these problems should not be handed over clearly during the handover and should be dealt with in the next shift. A solution will be filed after the morning meeting! But Kegui Hotel went to report it after seeing me. Did it want to see how angry the customer was and his intention to pursue the case before offering a solution?
Finally, a woman who claimed to be the manager called me and told me that she needed to meet and talk with me. I said it was not necessary. She finally told me that she could give us a 30% discount on the room rate. She also told me that our employees would bear the other 30%. ! I'm speechless! Tell me what these are for, and I don’t need a generous discount. I don’t want a penny for the service you provided! Since it was a pre-authorized room charge, I ended up refunding more than 200 yuan to resolve the farce! Thank you very much!
The above comments do not contain any extreme mentality, they are all my real experiences! I just want to give you a real experience of staying!

msg:I have never been so angry about staying in a hotel. First of all, the room rate is not that of a budget hotel, so the facilities should keep up. It is 27.28 degrees in Beijing these days. The glass is fully enclosed and exposed to direct sunlight. The temperature in the room can reach over 34 degrees Celsius. I thought in the afternoon. It would be a dream to rest in the room. When I first checked into the family room, there were no windows. The temperature reached 30 degrees at 12 o'clock in the evening. I couldn't bear it and called the hotel to ask why the air conditioner couldn't be used. Is there a fan if it can't be used? I was told no, so I ended up changing to a suite with a small window, but it couldn't save me from the shock caused by the current temperature and direct sunlight in Beijing. After staying for three nights, my friends and I didn't fall asleep for more than 3 hours a day. Just like The Walking Dead, the pillows are invincible and difficult to use. They are either too low and soft to make you feel the presence, and when you replace them, they are as hard as rocks. Anyway, there is no pillow that you can sleep on. The mattress is almost the same, and the hair dryer is also the same. , called and said it was broken and replaced it, and explained various reasons. They were not happy when we came to the room, thinking that we didn't know how to use the hair dryer. They said it was a new batch, how could it be broken, and then opened it but it could still be opened, and then said Don't you think this is good? Then the staff left, but he didn't know that the problem with the hair dryer was that it automatically stopped and stopped blowing after a while. In the end, it took a long time to change it. In short, it was very bad. ! ! I think I am a less picky person. As long as I am more popular and good-looking, I will not be so angry.

There are various shops and restaurants downstairs, and the first and sixth floors can directly connect to the shopping mall. The room is relatively large and simple in style. Some people say it doesn't look like a five-star hotel, but for this location, price, and area, it's pretty good. The first disadvantage is that there is no place to hang clothes in the bathroom, which may not be convenient for family travel; the second is that there are not enough coffee tables and sofas.

The hotel facilities and brands are all top-notch, and the service attitude and problem-solving abilities are also pretty good.
So what's the problem?
The layout of the hotel causes the east side to be exposed to more sunlight and the air is not circulated. On days when the temperature is less than 20 degrees, the indoor temperature in the room is always above 28 degrees. The indoor warm sleeves are too hot. The outdoor sweatshirts and jackets are a bit cold in the wind.
I don’t understand Beijing’s policies. Why is there no air conditioner available at the end of March and April? After complaining, I was given a fan. The fresh air also has no effect. The air is not circulated and the indoor smell is not very fresh.

The room we had reserved was a large family room but it was very hot, they changed us to a smaller one, and we had agreed that they were going to give us a discount because they were different rooms, but the communication was very bad within the hotel and in the end we did not receive the agreed discount.
Breakfast very few options.
It is certainly not a 5 or 4 star hotel.

The facilities have major flaws. The air-conditioning system is not independent but relies on the central air-conditioning in Joy City, so even if the room is very hot at the end of March, you still have to find a fan. The swimming pool and gym facilities are good but they are open to the public, so there are many people and chaos. We took I didn’t go even if I had my bathing suit on
Breakfast is very average for a five-star hotel, with few varieties and expensive. This is the only hotel in China that does not provide breakfast for two children (7 and 11 years old who eat very little). The tofu is not only the kind of white jade tofu with braised food. , I had diarrhea several times after eating on the first day.

The overall feeling is that the location is good and the supporting facilities are quite good. However, the hotel's service and the quality of the rooms are very poor. The service is slow and the attitude is poor. The layout of the room is very unreasonable and some sewers and other facilities are old and have minor problems with incomplete functions.

msg:Our family of three came to Beijing from Australia and stayed at the Beijing Joy Hotel for 5 nights from March 3 to March 8. We experienced that the location of this hotel is not only good, but also very good. Because it is very close to Xidan Metro. It takes about 10 to 15 minutes to walk. Because of the two sessions, it was very inconvenient to take a taxi, so we took the subway every day to go to many famous attractions in Beijing. Save time, money and worry thanks to the excellent location of Dayue! And the room was clean, spacious and comfortable. This is great for a picky person like me. There are also hotels that meet many of our additional simple needs. We highly recommend this hotel to our friends and relatives at home and abroad.

Dayue's value for money is slightly higher than that of Pacific. I like their theme room the most, but I haven’t made a reservation yet. The hotel upgraded us to a suite for free upon arrival, which was very humane, but the room was a bit damp at the end of August. The disadvantage is that the overall feeling is not high-end enough. The advantage is that it is seamlessly connected to Joy City and shopping is simply too convenient!

The surrounding business district is also very mature. The hotel elevator and high-rise lobby are indeed a bit hot, but the indoor air conditioner is not bad. It's not bad, just turn on the air conditioner when you enter the house. Hygiene and service are not as bad as the previous comments. When I came back when it was very hot outside, a beautiful woman at the front desk offered to drink iced drinks for free, and the service was not as bad as others said.
In terms of food delivery, I don’t know why the robot was not activated. When there is food delivery, you need to go downstairs to pick it up.
The hotel is definitely not as luxurious as a five-star hotel, but considering the convenient location, and considering that the starting price of a certain flower is usually 900-1300 yuan a night during this period, it is still a good choice comprehensively.

The washbasin also serves as the partition between the entrance, the bathroom and the room.

It's only a 5-10 minute walk from the Line 1 and Line 4 subway stations, making it very convenient to go to various attractions. The room is spacious and bright, and is equipped with a humidifier and a small refrigerator. The front desk must like it when I saw that I checked in with my children at 11 o'clock. The only drawback is that the central air conditioner cannot adjust the temperature. Fortunately, the windows can be opened. The bathroom is directly connected to the room with no partitions. Although wet and dry are separated, there is no exhaust. Overall, the location and price are very cost-effective. High praise!

msg:During this trip to Beijing, I was pleasantly surprised when I stayed at Dayue. The room facilities are relatively new and the hygiene is very careful. I am used to wiping all tabletops, bathroom countertops, toilets, etc. with wet wipes after checking in. After wiping the wipes, they are not black; Beijing is relatively dry indoors, and the staff has repeatedly asked whether you need water. The elevators on the 6th and 7th floors of the hotel and Joy City are connected to each other. It is also very convenient to go to the shopping mall to eat. The most important thing is that you don’t have to carry heavy bags and coats. ; The transportation is also very convenient. We went to Tiananmen, the National Museum of China, the Forbidden City, and the Science and Technology Museum. Thanks to the hotel staff - Xiao Shen at the front desk and the cleaning aunt for their service during the stay, making you feel at home.

The room is quite big and the facilities are a bit old. Acceptable
The breakfast is really hard to describe. The variety is not as good as Atour Season. 100 per person can catch up with five stars.
The front desk said that the restaurant is outsourced. This is the first time I have heard of it.
The family room only provides breakfast for two people, which is very confusing.
There are a lot of takeaways piled at the door, and you can’t find them at the front desk. The robot delivery is also very slow.
The only point of praise: the storage service is good
Not cost effective

A little suggestion: Change the exhaust fan in the bathroom to a more powerful one, and there will be almost no odor at all! Hey, I don’t know if the hotel will listen to my serious suggestions again and again. I will just do my part for subsequent tourists! Joy Hotel, don't waste your excellent location.

The Do Not Disturb sign I hung up when I went out was upside down. When the front desk noticed that the sign was up, I called to confirm. I have to like this manually👍
The location is great, with Joy City's two-story food restaurant downstairs, but it's a pity that we didn't notice it until we were leaving.
Pros: I called the front desk to ask for water, and room service immediately sent 4 bottles.
There is no odor in the bathroom and no odor in the room.
The mattress is moderately soft and hard, and the pillows are two soft and two hard (relatively hard).
There is an SF Express outlet downstairs, which is very convenient for sending things (I don’t like too many things to go with others, this is very important.)
It's a pity that I forgot to take a photo of the room.
Disadvantages: There is only one room key card. If there are two people staying, one person will have to pull out the key card if he goes downstairs. This is fine during the day, but if he does not go downstairs at night, he will have to endure the darkness in the room.

2. It happened to be May Day, but the hotel is very big and has a lot of rooms, so there are still some rooms that have not been fully booked. The young lady gave me a free upgrade to a king-bed room with a view. Thank you so much
3. The hotel is located in the central area of Xidan. The downstairs is the Joy City. It is a very prosperous area. It is very convenient to eat and drink. If you live on the tenth floor, the hotel elevator goes to the 6-7th floor to eat in the shopping mall. There is also a door at the front desk of the hotel lobby on the first floor Straight to the mall
4. The room is 35 square meters and quite big. The overall is simple and comfortable. It is only one or two subway stations away from Tiananmen Square, which is very convenient.

First, I searched around Chaoyang Joy City, and found that the nearest hotel was a few hundred meters away, so I had an idea to search around Xidan Joy City. I didn’t expect Joy Hotel to be located in a shopping mall. I was overjoyed, as if it was measured for me. Personally built, it is really full of personality 😆 The room is located in a busy city but the sound insulation is good, plus the super comfortable bedding and bedding, and perhaps the blessing of shopping and exercising a lot, I sleep well every night. The room is very spacious, with a modern, simple and tall style. The shower, washbasin and toilet are separated, which is a very scientific design. The staff at the front desk are warm and thoughtful, and their smiles make you feel welcome. The doorman is also very active in helping, and it was a very pleasant stay experience. Thank you to everyone who helped, I will definitely come back in the future😊

Major tourist attractions such as Tiananmen, Forbidden City, and Wangfujing can be reached at once by taking Line 1, and since it is located in the center, transportation is very convenient. The room was very clean, there was no cigarette smell at all and all facilities were in like new condition. Even though I visited during the National Day holiday, the Xidan area was not very crowded and was pleasant. Breakfast is available for 100 yuan per person, and most of the menu is Chinese, so please keep this in mind. Overall, I was very satisfied with everything, but was disappointed by the lack of English-speaking staff. It boasts an excellent location with all amenities nearby, and is quieter than other tourist attractions, so I would like to visit this place again the next time I visit Beijing. The staff were very friendly, and most of all, I really liked the condition of the accommodation. For Korean travelers, you can purchase and receive a refund for an Ikatong (transportation card) at Sidan Station, so it would be convenient to purchase a card here and travel. I paid for my accommodation with Alipay and had no problems using my international card. Highly recommended!

msg:It is a rare high-end business hotel in the hotel-style Financial Street. It is close to Joy City. You don’t have to worry about eating and shopping. The hotel rooms are very comfortable. Unlike other hotels that are still turning on the heating until now (March), it makes people suffer from the heat. No, and the quilts in the hotel are cotton quilts, not duvets. It is very comfortable to sleep and very user-friendly. I would like to praise this point

Secondly, the service is very good. I took the children alone, took the initiative to add WeChat and took the initiative to care about and ask about needs during the stay. Here, I would like to praise Xiaoshen's team service at the front desk!
Finally, the overall hotel environment is clean and tidy, and the check-in experience is very good. During the stay, it happened to be the Chinese Valentine's Day and there was an activity to write cards and send flowers in the hotel lobby.
The overall experience is very good, and I will choose to stay next time I come to Beijing!

msg:Say it first:
The location is unbeatable. It is in the center of Xidan. All scenic spots are basically accessible by subway. It is not too far away. Not far from the door is the subway entrance of Line 1 and Line 4. The hotel is connected to the 6th floor of the shopping mall, which is particularly convenient for personal travel or taking children to eat, drink and have fun. The hotel staff are quite enthusiastic and will take the initiative to say hello.
The room was fairly neat and clean, and there was no dust accumulated in any of the corners. The room is designed in a simple style, which I quite like.
After applying over the phone, I agreed to delay the check-out time until 3 o'clock, which was not easy during the peak summer season.
What can be improved:
The lobby is really too basic, and the elevator design is hard to describe. My first impression when I walked in was that I wanted to retreat.
I booked a family room, but there was no partition in the bathroom and it had a single basin, which was really inconvenient for parents traveling with children.
The lighting design of the room is too simple and not warm and comfortable enough. The curtains are not electric and inconvenient. Some of the small items in the room are not refined and high-end enough.
The water in the shower room is relatively small and the bath is not comfortable enough. The room is not equipped with a bathtub. Although I don't use a bathtub, I am used to washing my hair in the morning. I usually use the shower head of the bathtub to wash my hair outside, which is inconvenient. Not equipped with a bathtub, which is still rare in a hotel with a price of 1200.
Summary: For those who have high location requirements and care about convenient travel, eating, drinking and entertainment, the Joy Hotel will still meet their needs. But for those who have high requirements for room comfort, there may be better options. But in terms of overall evaluation, we booked early, and the family room cost 1,200, with two 1.5 large beds, and the price/performance ratio was still appropriate.

There was also an error in calculating the room rate for one night, and we were busy with other things for two days. We were bombarded with phone calls, and finally the police station threatened us and demanded money. It turned out that they made a mistake, so they just apologized and said kind words to me.

The facilities inside are also very simple. When I got to the room and opened the door, there was a strong smell. It feels like no one has lived there for a long time. Then ask the guest room for mineral water. He actually said he wouldn't give it. Although it was given later. Then the air conditioner draws light from the air outlet all the time. There was a slight noise a few days ago. But it doesn't affect sleep. Forget it, it was around five o'clock in the morning on the third day. It made such a loud noise. Wake up abruptly. It lasted for more than an hour. Unbearable. Call a repairman to come and fix it. Call the front desk and ask for a disposable bath mask for the bathtub. The attitude is terrible. He hung up before he finished speaking. And the sound insulation is very poor. The water running upstairs was loud. More than two thousand a night is really not worth it.

First, the hotel room has a strong smell of formaldehyde from the decoration. I asked the front desk to change rooms. The waiter said that the room facing the sun smelled bad due to the sun. If the guest felt uncomfortable, he should change to a room with a shaded side.
Second, there is no hot water in the room! ! When I took a shower at 10-11 pm, the water was cold. The engineering staff came to repair it and said that there were too many people taking showers at this time and there was no hot water supply. Not even a small hotel. In addition, the bath towels in the room were wet, which I didn't understand.
Third, the service was extremely poor. I complained to the front desk. I said that you did not meet the five-star standards. The front desk actually said that we did not have five stars. It was Ctrip that gave them five stars. Ctrip's evaluation was also drunk.
I suggest that everyone who goes to Xicheng, there are many hotels nearby, don't choose this one. They don't deserve the five diamonds and the price.

msg:I generally don’t comment on travel. This hotel is in a good location. It’s in a shopping mall, convenient for eating and drinking, and close to various attractions. But I don’t know why there is a strong musty smell in the room, and the air conditioner is not cooling well. It is said that it is a unified central air conditioner, which means the temperature cannot be adjusted? The refrigerator in the room was not cold. When I asked when I left, I found out that it was not plugged in. I could plug it in if I wanted to use it. Is it possible to check such a small amount of electricity in such a big hotel... After staying for one night, I smelled musty all night, and I was sweating from the heat. , if you want to move in, consider it yourself.

msg:At the price of 2000➕ per night, the room does not have a bathtub or breakfast. The sink is directly next to the bed. It is really disappointing. The configuration of this room can at best be considered a high-end room in an express hotel.
The air conditioner in the room is on, but it cannot adjust the temperature by itself, which does not meet the standards of this star-rated hotel.
Just this one time, not recommended to stay with children.

msg:On the night of May 2 before check-out, the 3-year-old child fell from the bed, resulting in a broken jaw, and went to the hospital for 3 stitches. As long as there is a carpet cushion on the floor next to the bed, or a booster stool at the end of the bed to help the child get into bed (this configuration is in all room types), it will not cause such serious consequences. Afterwards, the hotel did not give the result in time, and had a tough attitude and refused to take responsibility. It was not until the Beijing Citizens Hotline was called and the Beijing Bureau of Culture and Tourism intervened that the hotel's attitude eased and an apology was made. Whether it is the hotel's software and hardware facilities or the hotel's post-service services, they are not worthy of the price and the hotel's star rating. This is the first time a hotel has given a bad review after so many stays.

Guests have to pick up everything by themselves in a five-star hotel. It’s really amazing. From the 18th floor to the first floor, it looks clean to the naked eye. The rest is useless, except for those traveling to Beijing. Don't come to anyone else.

There were only a few toiletries in the bathroom, and there was only a robot in such a big hotel to deliver food. It took longer to get upstairs than when the takeout was delivered, and the noodles were all lumpy. I went down to get them and asked the staff how to pick up the food. They ignored me three times and asked me to apply for accommodation certificates. They took us several times on a hot day. The police station didn’t even bother to handle it, but in the end I was told there was no need to handle it. Who cares? It’s a five-star hotel. This is a five-star hotel in the capital with this configuration? It’s okay if our own countrymen come to stay. But if foreigners come to stay, do they think a five-star hotel in the capital of China will have this configuration?

I hope this can be a reference for all guests. Please give a warning to hotel management! You are a five-star hotel, I really don’t know how to rate it. To sum up: the check-in network was broken, the TV was broken, the take-out robot was broken, the water in the morning was yellow and turbid (it scared me), I called the switchboard, the front desk, and the lobby manager twice and no one answered! The following are detailed instructions, so you must choose this hotel carefully! It is recommended to try the Pan Pacific opposite. The price is about the same and the environment is much better!
🧹Hygiene: There were water stains in the toilet after check-in. The liquid stains on the wall were clearly visible. I didn't bother to check the hygiene in the small corner. There was also dust on the sofa that I could only wipe off before use.
🍃Environment: There is no five-star experience at all. There is no fragrance in the hotel lobby, only the smell of sewerage in a bungalow in Beijing, right up to the elevator. Although it is an advantage that the elevator is connected to the shopping mall, people in the shopping mall can also use the hotel elevator to go to the first floor. As you can imagine, it is crowded, noisy, and safe. The decoration style is more like a B&B, with a sense of cheapness and cheapness, not to mention the public facilities and public spaces, and there is no five-star vision. The location of the hotel may be the only saving grace, but the road at the entrance is narrow and one-way.
⛱Facilities: The room I stayed in (I need to explain this: First of all, I did not see a blind box room in the obvious position on the booking platform. I was told when I checked in. I was hesitant and anxious so I didn’t care too much. I specifically asked to help arrange one. Good rooms. Finally, I was assigned a "fashionable and modern" room directly facing the elevator... The simple facilities and decoration are hard to describe. The decorative paintings in the room cannot be cheaper than Taobao.) It only has a single room. Sofa and round table, no desk! The most awesome thing is that the network cannot be connected according to the sign, and the TV display is faulty. Although maintenance personnel later solved the network problem, the experience was poor and quite unprofessional.
🔔Service: The switchboard service staff has no service attitude, is full of arrogance, and is impatient when there are too many questions. After explaining the check-in experience at the front desk when checking out, the explanation was quite amateurish, without explaining the reason and without any attitude towards handling it. Later, I called to apologize. The hotel's sincerity in apologizing was to give me a 100 yuan discount coupon for my next stay. After I clearly refused, the other party hung up the phone impatiently.
...This is the worst experience of staying in a five-star hotel. There is no need for you to come here and step on the thunder. The so-called Internet celebrities and blind boxes are all gimmicks. For the same fee of more than 1,000, it is better to choose an old group hotel directly. This kind of hotel will not be used a second time!

msg:Выбирали отель в центре, максимально близко к площади Тяньаньмэнь и Запретному городу. Планировали оставаться в Пекине 3 ночи и 4 дня.
Локация. До площади 1 станция метро по бордовой ветке (линия 1) и с 1 пересадкой, если выйти на синюю ветку (линия 4). Отель практически находится дверь в дверь с ТЦ Joy City и еще 2-3-мя крупными ТЦ. В общем, можно всласть пошоппиться за большие деньги, хотя есть качественные вещи и разного уровня бренды. Внутри этих ТЦ множество кафе, +у дороги есть ресторанчики на любой кошелек. Голодными точно не останетесь. 
До отеля на такси из аэропорта Capital PEK, около часа. Из отеля тоже почти час до аэропорта Daxin. 
Сервис. Тут всё сложно. С учетом того, что отель позиционирует себя на Trip.com, как 5*  и стоимость ночи почти как в Хилтоне, удивляет почти полное отсутствие знания английского на фронт-деске. Но это полбеды, как выяснилось, в отеле не принимают оплату картами VISA и MASTERCARD (не российских банков). Только карты Union Pay (в т.ч российских банков, у меня приняли от Примсоцбанка). 
Мы приехали раньше официального time for check-in. Кстати, оно в 14:00. Мы приехали в 12:30. Номера не были готовы. Но начали оформлять. Оформлялись около часа. У нас были забронированы 4 номера. 3 из них бронировали по одной брони, 1 по отдельной. В итоге, нам всё намешали. Пытались долго разобраться через русско-китайские переводчики на телефонах всем миром, где чей номер (т.к два нужны были для single, два для couple), а нам просто выдали 4 пары ключ-карт. Типа сами разберетесь. +Бардак был с кол-вом оплаченных завтраков. Надо проверять. Далее, сюрпризом стал обязательный депозит в 500 юаней за номер. Если вы не разобрались с завтраками (например, как у нас в одном из номеров общей брони проживали 2 человека, но при заказе не выбрали именно 2 завтрака, а просто завтрак, как в др. странах делают), то завтрак на второго человека будет списываться с вашего депозита. Естественно вас об этом не предупредят. Как и о том, что при бронировании на Trip.com было указано, что отель предоставляет поздний выезд бесплатно. По-сути, именно из-за этого мы и выбрали этот отель, т.к. вылет в Россию в 01:55 утра. Но, оказалось, что поздний выезд - это не в 12:00 (как обычно принято), а в 14:00. Если вы планируете выехать позднее, то действует следующее правило: выселение до 18:00 с вас возьмут доплату 50% от стоимости суток, после 18:00 полную оплату за сутки. Думаете вам об этом скажут? Ни Trip.com о таком не сообщает, ни отель, если вы попробуете узнать об этом заранее. Узнаете либо при выселении, либо, если напрямую зададите вопрос. Мы узнали, потому что спросили. 
Еще сюрприз, это Wi-Fi. Там на все номера один пароль и логин, который знают на ресепшене, но при заселении не скажут (просто потому что не знают английский, уже оформлять вас и отвечать на другие вопросы  стресс). А система попытается вас зарегистрировать по номеру китайского телефона и даже если он есть, неудачно. По номеру комнаты тоже не зарегистрирует. Надо спуститься на ресепшен и узнать, что в графе комната/логин указываем 1637, пароль 1637. 
К 14:00 у нас заселили 3 только комнаты. Моя не была готова. К 14:30 комната так и не была убрана. Я возмутилась, что итак жду дольше, чем официальное время заселения и если там так намусорено, то поменяйте 
 номер. Мне дали другой номер. 
Резюмируя, сам по себе отель не плохой. Но тех денег за сутки и рейтинга на трипкоме не стоит. Трудности коммуникаций будут вызывать недоумение и боль. Не смотря на то, что персонал пытается помочь, но честно, не знает чем, потому что просто не понимают. В остальном, все там вполне нормально. Номера чистые, светлые, убираются каждый день, есть халаты, тапочки, сейф, чайные принадлежности. Завтраки очень вкусные, разнообразные; с 6:30 до 10:00. Есть спортзал и бассейн (где занимаются дети плаванием, поэтому с обеда там полно детей и их родителей в зоне ожидания за стеклом).  Ресторан на 8 этаже. Там очень большое меню, но на китайском и есть ограниченное меню на английском.

msg:我們來北京旅遊，選擇了大悦酒店。整體入住很滿意。酒店地處一號線與四號線換成的西單站，附近各種美食應有盡有，而且去天安門，頤和園都很方便。
當天我們入住的時候，工作人員怕我們等待時間過長，還遞給我們飲料讓我們解渴。✌🏼

房間乾淨整潔，劃重點：還可以去9樓健身房免費運動！！這個健身房和商場是一體的，不是簡單的幾台機器，還可以去上課！
就是淋浴的水不是很大，可能是要節能環保的原因吧。 今天走的時候工作人員小戰小妹妹還送了我們一份拼圖作為禮物。好開心啊。推薦！以後還會來☺️

The hotel is very nice. At the check-in we got some free lemonades and everyday 2l of water delivered in our room. The room was beautiful with a nice view of Beijing. Furthermore, the location is very nice. Directly in the same house is a mall with different shops and restaurants and other malls in the neighborhood. You can order your meal to the hotel and a robot will deliver it to your room, when you call the reception before. Just 5 minutes per foot there are the subway lines 1 and 4 that brings you to Guomao （1）, the forbidden city （1） or the summer palace （4）. If you are in Beijing you have to try the Beijing duck. Just delicious. At the check-out we got a wooden puzzle as a present.

msg:8月下旬夫婦倆帶着小孫女去北京遊玩，選擇了西單大悦城的這家酒店。應該説酒店的位置很好，距離天安門廣場、北海公園等都很近。酒店連着大悦城，邊上還有其他大商場，吃飯購物等都很方便。當然酒店本身的配套有點欠缺。餐飲也衹提供早餐，而且品種不夠豐富。服務方面給分較少是因為我們總共住了6個晚上，分成兩個訂單，第一個訂單4晚（含早），第二個訂單2晚（不含早）。我們跟前台申請將第一個訂單中的一次早餐調換到第二個訂單中，前台説酒店不能操作，讓我們找攜程。我們找了攜程，攜程跟酒店也沒能商量通。最後我自己又找到前台，跟他們説如果這點小事都不能變通，我一定給差評。後來前台來電通知説可以調換了。問題雖然得到了解決，但內心的感受並不愉快。

不足之處，安排的房間不值這個房價，早餐品種少，第一次遇到五星級酒店早餐不匹配。服務員打掃房間，如果看到客人行李箱打開放在那裡就不要把浴室墊放在我行李箱上，第一次放我沒説什麼，第二次還是這麼放。我的行李箱裏都是衣服，你把地墊放在我衣服上面，好嗎？太過分了！

從辦理入住開始 一切都超出預期

特別感謝前台沈經理和他的團隊 非常體貼
幫我們做了升級 關注我們對房間的喜好
看我還在咳嗽 還主動詢問是否需要更多的水和幫助
很温暖的感覺

硬件設施非常好，房間簡約智能，
空間感也特別好，體驗感真是不亞於五星酒店

位置很方便，跟大悦城通着
酒店電梯直接可到商場6層，
吃住玩遊購娛真的是一起解決 
以後出行還會過來的，感受非常好

酒店在北京商業中心西單，與西單大悦城連成一體，盡享西單的繁華與便利，足不出户即可以實現住宿、逛街、美食、電影等休閑娛樂一條龍服務，而且酒店離北京金融街僅幾分鐘車程，商務出行也非常便捷，這樣得天獨厚的商業環境在北京的星級酒店中也算是寥寥無幾了！

房間裏的佈置也很簡單清新，窗外的景色也很好，下午還能拉開窗簾曬曬太陽。床具和枕頭也很舒服。

另外，在居住過程中，不幸被健康寶彈窗了，前台的張思雨小姐姐特別給力，人美心善，耐心地回答我的問題，幫我聯繫文旅局找到解決方法。核酸結果出來了第一時間幫我上傳，衹用了幾小時就解封了。必須要手動點贊

msg:地點不錯，服務太一般，下次不會選擇入住。外賣員跟前台確認好酒店能把外賣早餐送到房間，20分鐘沒送，打電話詢問後又過20分鐘機器人才來送。早上8點鐘打電話到前台問游泳館幾點開放，説現在就能遊，到游泳館通知説10點才能進，回房間又等了1個多小時。游泳館不是針對酒店住客的，假期十幾個教練帶着大大小小的學員大呼小叫，外面都是送孩子的家長。這也是5星級的標準，醉了醉了！
