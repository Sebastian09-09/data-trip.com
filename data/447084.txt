msg:I recently stayed at Nanyuan Hotel during my visit to Ningbo, and I must say, I was impressed. The room was spacious, clean and comfortable, with a lovely bathtub to relax in after a long day of sightseeing. I was also pleasantly surprised to receive a complementary bowl of fruits on arrival, which was a nice touch. The hotel staff were friendly and accommodating, even offering complementary yogurt during my stay.

The breakfast spread was good, although I would have preferred more western food options. Unfortunately, when I visited, they had run out of fried bacon. However, this did not detract from the overall experience. I also appreciated the option of a late check-out, which allowed me to leave after 1 PM.

Overall, I would recommend Nanyuan Hotel to anyone visiting Ningbo. The staff were friendly, the room was comfortable, and the complementary extras were a nice touch. I would definitely consider staying here again, provided the price is right.

Apologies about my photos, I remembered to take them only when I was a bout to check out.

The room is not big, but it has everything you need, and it also uses a smart toilet. There are many varieties of breakfast, and you can eat Ningbo glutinous rice balls. One of the points deducted is that the central air conditioning does not cool. The outdoor temperature was 21℃ on the day of check-in, and it was even lower at night. But the room temperature was always 26℃, and it was hard to fall asleep even if the window was opened. I hope the hotel will solve this problem as soon as possible.

msg:Let's talk about the service first: Front Office: We booked two superior rooms. We arrived at the hotel at around 11:00 am on the 3rd. We asked if we could check in, but we didn't expect to be arranged to check in directly. When checking in, the waiter named Wang Qing on the badge upgraded the room type for our two rooms and checked in very quickly! My parents were very happy, and the rooms were very close. The five-star praise for the service is for her.
However, the room service was a little worse. There was only shampoo but no conditioner (this can be a reminder to other tourists and friends, you have to bring your own conditioner), and other disposable toiletries were in small quantities. You can choose to bring your own or ask the room to deliver, but it took a long time to deliver (after three phone calls to urge, it took about an hour in total). Maybe it was a holiday, so it was busy! Cleaning the next day, the garbage in the trash can was confiscated. They called at 8 o'clock in the morning to ask if we wanted to clean the room! It may not be very friendly to guests who may want to sleep in!
Restaurant: Breakfast is a combination of Chinese and Western food, generally speaking, it's okay! Coffee, bread, wontons, noodles, co**** grains, vegetables, fruits, beverages, milk and yogurt are basically all covered. The waiter was also very diligent and could close the dishes in time when he saw that the dishes were empty.
The hotel is located a little south of the city center, and the location is good. It is basically within three kilometers to the downtown area of ​​the scenic spot, and the taxi will not exceed 15 yuan. It is quite convenient.

In short, the hotel is good, with a magnificent appearance, a good environment, and good room hygiene. I will choose Nanyuan next time I come, and I look forward to the improvement of the service of the housekeeping department

I really can't complain about this bathroom. The door is only half, and when taking a shower, the water will flow out like crazy. After taking a shower, the whole bathroom is flooded.
The flush toilet is not very useful. You have to press it hard for a long time before it can be flushed.
I don't know what the clock on the bedside means. I miss it so much that I can't fall asleep. I can only throw the clock far away.
Everything else is tolerable, but this bathroom is really not as good as those express hotels.

The hotel decorated the room for my dad's birthday, sent a super big cake, and gave my mom foot bath water at night! What a surprise!
And the two rooms are arranged together, which is very convenient and satisfactory! Next time I go to Ningbo, I will go to Nanyuan Hotel again, but the room is in the business building. It would be more convenient if it is arranged in the mainstream

I brought my parents with me and saw the considerate service provided by the floor housekeeper Ms. Duan Yuxia. She always cared for the elderly and brought water and snacks. On rainy days, she promptly delivered a footbath and hot water so that the elderly could relax and fall asleep. I was deeply attracted by the training and service of Nanyuan Hotel, and decided to stay at Nanyuan Hotel. From now on, I would definitely choose Nanyuan Hotel in Ningbo. Thank you Nanyuan Hotel!

But this time I was really disappointed. The hotel facilities are really bad. The room is very old, the wallpaper is peeling, the carpet is dirty, the hygiene is average, and the bathroom equipment feels like it is from the last century.

When entering the lobby, Gro takes the initiative to greet the guide for check-in. Duan Yuxia, the housekeeper of the double room on the 16th floor, was very nice. She took the initiative to ask about her needs and brought Ningbo snacks such as twists and moss biscuits.

I need to give special praise to the hotel concierge who helped me carry my bag to the room after checking in and gave me a brief introduction to the hotel. Since this time I stayed at the hotel on my wife’s wedding anniversary, they gave me a six-inch cake and they were very attentive. Small details like the blessing card written with a postcard from the 'Butterfly Lovers' attraction made our stay a great experience.

Overall, it is an old local five-star hotel with good value for money.

msg:As the first five-star hotel in Zhejiang Province, it should be said that the service is good. The front desk has a good attitude and responds quickly to problems.
I arrived at the hotel at around 10 o'clock on Saturday and checked in. The front desk upgraded the room to a business building. Thanks, and with the coupons provided by Ningbo, this night was very cost-effective.
The hotel room style is veteran style, which is understandable considering the opening time. Ctrip said it would be renovated in 2019, but it turned out that only the 17th floor of the main building was renovated. Ctrip's wording is too deceptive. Because the room is old, there are many flaws after checking in. 1. The air conditioner is too hot. The front desk said that the central air conditioner cannot be adjusted. They suggested that we open the window. We searched for a long time and found that it was this small window and it was always open. The curtains at the window could not be opened even if they were blocked. Know what the cooling effect is. 2. The hotel provides a fan with a very short wire. For comfort at night, I can only put the fan on the table. 3. In addition, the cooling effect of the fan is average. After eating supper in the middle of the night, the room is already 28 degrees Celsius. 4. One of the two two-pin plugs on the desk is out of power. 5. The security is poor and the door lock at the circled area cannot be used. 6. The sound insulation effect is poor. There is an obvious door crack under the door. When the doorbell is pressed in the next room, we can misunderstand that it is ours. Although we did not feel it was very noisy during our stay, it can only be said that there were too few guests.
Although the price of stay is very cheap, I will never come here again because of the air conditioner.

  The hotel is located in the old town. It takes a little more than two hours to navigate there.
facility:
   The hotel must be many years old, because the facilities inside are relatively old. Such a large hotel does not even have a children's paradise, which is a huge failure! There are also stairs in the restaurant, and there are very few things to eat. The price of 158 is a bit high.
health:
    There was no comb in the room, and when we went to have breakfast on the first floor, I thought about asking the front desk to ask room service to send it directly to the room so that we could use it when we came back after eating. However, the lady at the front desk said that we needed to call ourselves. Are they irresponsible? ? ? Okay, then just go back to your room and call the customer service center to ask for it. They said that the room is not available. If you need it, call them and they will send it to you? ? This is the first time I have been staying in a hotel for so many years that I was given a comb when I needed it. It was not included in the hotel.
Recommended:
    Four stars. When parking, I asked the front desk if I had a parking ticket before asking me to report my license plate. Shouldn't you ask the guests before checking in?

We thought that a five-star hotel should have all the facilities and facilities, but we didn’t expect that there were no charging stations in the hotel parking lot, which brought us a lot of trouble. Trouble, we have to go out to find charging piles every day, charge for 2-3 hours, and pay parking fees. Not every scenic spot has a charging pile. We waste 2-3 hours of charging time every day, waiting outside to finish charging before turning on the car. This was my biggest mistake in choosing Nanyuan Hotel this time. There is no charging station in a five-star hotel. It’s too dizzying. The self-service breakfast is too perfunctory. It’s not five-star. The front desk service is okay. I don’t think this hotel is five-star. It’s worth it. This is my first stop in Ningbo during this trip. I was really unhappy when I encountered it. I was reminded not to look at the star rating when traveling later. I was so disappointed.

Line 4 at the gate will arrive at Dongqian Lake very quickly. Rent a shop. It’s cool to shuttle through the traffic jams and enjoy the scenery along the way.
Ah, I stopped by the museum and had seafood noodles

The key is that the hotel also has a large swimming pool and gym. You can use it for free with your room card. There is also a children's swimming pool for children, which is very cost-effective.

I arrived at the hotel at 10:30 in the morning. I got a room as soon as I arrived. It was on the 23rd floor. It was comfortable and had a good view.
The attitude of the waiters is also very good, everyone is smiling.
Maybe it was because I brought children with me, but there was a Jiejiele for both days of my stay, which was very considerate.
The smart equipment in the guest room is also very popular with children. They can watch cartoons whenever they talk. After all, these gadgets are not installed at home.

Overall, it was a satisfying trip. Will stay again next time.

First of all, the good points: the lobby is spacious and comfortable, and the boys at the front desk and the boys in the guest rooms will greet each other politely when they meet in the corridor. This impression good. I don’t think it’s good for anything else! Bad reviews: 1. The hotel facilities are really old and outdated. The air conditioner temperature could not be turned down all the time. I asked the hotel to borrow a fan when it was hot for a few days. 2. Except for toothbrushes, disposable items will not be put away (bathroom). Caps, bathtub covers, razors, etc.) I bought a box of mineral water from takeaway. 3. The overall cleanliness of the room and bathroom is not as clean as a single ward in a public hospital! 4. The lighting in the room is dim and the lighting is very uncomfortable. Anyway, this is the worst "five-star" hotel I have ever stayed in.

What satisfies me the most is that they have an indoor heated swimming pool, which is quite large. Now I have developed a habit of wanting to swim every day, even if I am out of town, I don’t want to delay. This swimming pool is worth my next stay.
In other respects, the location is good, the floor view is good, it is spacious, and welcome fruit is given. The disadvantage is that there are all old five-star hotels, and the facilities and decoration are old-fashioned and old-fashioned, just like Shangri-La and other old five-star hotels.

The attitude of the service staff in the hotel is very good, because there is a sudden urgent need to check out, but there were a lot of people at the front desk at that time, and there was no time to wait for the invoice to be issued, so I told the service staff about the situation. The service staff left a contact information and sent the invoice to my address, thank you very much!

msg:I stayed in Ningbo for the first time in a while. I chose a 5 star hotel near the subway. I had a problem with my stay this time. First of all, it was a plan without breakfast, so when I checked in, I asked for a receipt for breakfast for consecutive nights, but they did not respond. It is a nuance that you can pay for each meal at the entrance of the venue. I asked for it again and again, but I wondered what I was in a hurry to do, so I started dealing with other guests before I could finish it, so there was no breakfast on my accommodation card. They didn't even accept the payment (male fron**an with glasses). I entered the room, but I wasn't satisfied, so I went to the front desk again. The time is 15:00, and it seems that the front desk man who couldn't respond earlier is going home from the side door... It seems that he neglected the customer's request because he was worried about the return time. I felt the quality of this hotel. The water supply in the room became muddy brown, and the front staff was present to change the room. It was a changed room, but the back of the non-slip bath mat was full of black mold, so I reported it and had it replaced. The next day, when I checked the bathtub, it had not been cleaned and was still dirty. This was also confirmed by the front staff. When I asked if there was cleaning and what kind of checks they were doing, they showed me a form that said that cleaning had been done since 9:30. of? It's not an understandable document and it doesn't make any sense. After all, it would be nice if you could finish cleaning in the middle of such an exchange, but cleaning is postponed as time passes. After all, cleaning did not start even after 15 minutes, so I cleaned it myself. Cleaning from the next day was OK. I felt that I was not able to manage the crisis when a problem occurred. It is a 5-star hotel, but there is no conditioner, razor, or body lotion. Breakfast starts at 6:30, but only the reception staff and the cook are there at that time, and there is no horse staff. Even if the number of customers increases, the hall staff will not show up, and the horse staff will come to work at 7:00. Even if there are customers, there are no staff. The alignment of the bridges is also bad, and it is practically unusable. Regarding the provisional receipt for breakfast, I needed a formal receipt, so I asked Flint on the morning of check-in before breakfast, and told the male staff that I would like to receive it when I checked out. When checking out, the male staff who requested it was absent, and when I asked the female staff to check out, the answer was "No problem, it's over." When I asked, "I have requested a receipt, can you check it?" I have a question about how you manage messages for customers. During my stay this time, every time I had a problem, I asked the front desk staff for help, but to be honest, I felt uncomfortable. I would like to thank the tall woman at the front desk and the male staff who often visited the room. When staying at many hotels, there are big and small problems. What I can't forgive is the male staff with glasses who handles check-in. Therefore the evaluation is bad.

Ningbo City, a long distance residence. A 5-star hotel near the metro station. There is a problem with this next accommodation. First of all, because there is no breakfast plan, it's time to live in, please contact us for breakfast at the lodging, so we've already got it, but there's no response. This is a minor difference since it can be added at the entrance of the venue every time. I've asked repeatedly, but I don't know what to do. Payment is not available. Entering the room, unable to accept or leave the front desk, as a result, the female front desk staff was successful. The time is 15:00. Feel the quality of this hotel. The room's natural water is replenished brown, and the room is completed under the cooperation of a local worker. Of course, the rooms have changed, but there are many black spots in the bathroom that prevent slipping. In the second day, I've finished bathing, but it's still clean, and I'm sorry. This is a front desk worker, please check it out. Please check if it's clean or not, and when you check it out, I've been looking at it for a while. Hopefully, I hope to complete the cleanup process during this interactive process, but it is recommended that it be cleaned up over time. As a result, after 15 minutes, the cleaning process started, and it was self-cleaning. It's possible to start the second day, and it's over. We have found that there are ongoing crisis management problems. It's a five-star hotel, but it doesn't have hair, razor, body lotion. Breakfast starts at 6:30, but at that time there was only a local receptionist, a Japanese chef, and a pipe worker. Immediately, the number of customers increased, and the large office worker did not meet, and the turnaround time for the brass pipe worker was 7:00. The guest is absent, but the worker is absent. I don't like the layout of the bridge, so it's practically impossible to use. Of course, it is necessary to pay for dinner early, but it is a formal requirement, so it is necessary to start early when you move in. When it's time to leave, there is no mandated male worker, and when the requested female worker is about to leave, the answer is "I'm sorry, I'm done." When I asked, "Is it possible to confirm my request?" How do I know what I'm thinking about? At this time of the next residence, every time the problem arises, I will also handle the front desk workers, but the truth is that I don't like it. Thanks to the high-school female workers who always come to our office. There are many big and small problems in the city. An unlawful male worker who is responsible for the registration. The reason for this is that it is true.

msg:The room has been upgraded, but I can't stand it when I enter the room. Even if it's autumn, I can't bear it at 28 degrees. I thought it would be better to turn on the air conditioner when I came back later, but it was still stuffy when I came back in the middle of the night. Then the front desk said to call the guest room Look, after a few minutes, I didn't look at the guest room, didn't ask, didn't ask, and just showed us a fan, saying that the air conditioner is not turned on (very bad attitude), can a small fan solve the indoor temperature of 28 degrees? Later, I contacted the front desk (with a good attitude) and told me that Chaoyang's room would be too hot to help us change to the other side. After waiting for 15 minutes for the room attendant to deliver the card, we changed it by ourselves. It was so uncomfortable. I had contacted a long time ago and needed a newer room. Later, I was given an older room with older facilities and a small bathroom. Think about it and bear it for a night. Checking out the next day, the overall feeling is that the waiters are not enthusiastic, boring, completely inconsistent with the old five-star hotel!

From the moment I walked into the hotel lobby, it was hard to believe that this was a hotel from more than 20 years ago. Every detail was so well maintained, and the room size was also very large, with an old money temperament. The staff will take the initiative to say hello. There is also a special person who guides you to the room, which makes people feel very intimate. It is worth mentioning that the hotel's swimming pool adopts a water circulation system. Its pH value and record it, which should be impossible for many, many hotels. It can be seen from every detail of the hotel service that every staff member of Nanyuan Hotel is working hard to make it a benchmark for five-star hotels. So after staying in Ningbo for four nights, I found out that both Shangri-La and Westin just want to cheat your pension money, only Nanyuan Hotel is a real five-star hotel.

From the start of driving in, there are only ground parking spaces, and it is quite crowded. Parking is very inconvenient. The most important thing is that the security guard at the door does not pay attention and does not guide. Going back again, the whole process, the security guard stood and watched from a distance...

Let's talk about the front desk, the two little boys who checked in seemed to be here for an internship... The business was very unskilled, and the two staff members were much normal when they checked out.

In addition, the sofa in the lobby has always been up and down, and those who have taken off their shoes and lie on their feet are lying there, and no staff has come to remind them to stop them

The last breakfast, the variety is too small, the coffee machine is broken, there is black coffee brewed by an electric kettle, you have to drink a latte and add milk...no black tea or green tea...

Beyond expectations, there are welcome fruit yogurt and local mung bean cakes

Originally booked for two nights, stayed one night and left, I will not go again next time, it is the first time I come to Ningbo, and it is the first time to write such a detailed evaluation, it is too bad

The waiter here is also warm and thoughtful and taught us how to use the robot service (Xiao Du). On the second day, the floor housekeeper Duan Yuxia also specially added fruit and bottled water for us (because the temperature rose a bit hot that day) and their every move made people feel warm Heart! The buffet breakfast in Nanyuan is also very delicious 😋 There are many varieties and good taste! In particular, the moss-*****ed rice cakes are special and delicious 😋 There is also an electric toilet to praise the room, which is very convenient and comfortable.

If I wanted to change the room, I took my children and spread out a bunch of things. I really don’t want to move. I want to change it tomorrow. When we went out the next day, we were told by the cleaning staff that we could watch digital TV. I was glad that I came back in the evening after taking a shower to prepare to watch it, but I found that I couldn’t watch it. At the same time, I also found that the small digital Pad in the room could not watch it because the network could not be connected. Without entertainment, children can only watch videos on adults' mobile phones, and find that the refrigerator in the room is not cooling. When I broke down, I called customer service. The person said that I would transfer to the lobby manager. After I came to understand the situation, he said that he had learned about the project of this room and said there was a problem. Please, why should you give it to the guest if there is a problem? Then asked me what I wanted to do, shouldn't the hotel give the guests an attitude? How can I know? I want to exempt you from agreeing? Then the manager surnamed Li said to give us breakfast coupons. We said that because we had an appoin**ent with a friend in the morning, we could also accept lunch coupons. He said to apply first. After another hour, we were going to sleep and knocked on the door and told me that it was okay. , we couldn’t help but want to sleep. The next day, we went to the Chinese restaurant to eat the so-called prepared dishes... To be honest, it was the meal standard for the team, one cold dish, two meat and one vegetarian snack. It was said to be 200 per person for us. Yuan standard. Really disappointed me. There is no entertainment in the room, no internet, and the refrigerator is not cooling. The so-called compensation is really the standard to send people quickly.

It’s warm and warm. Seafood is also my favorite. When it comes to salmon and sushi, I have rounded up my original desire to eat Japanese ingredients. The deli area is full of barbecues, bullfrogs, and the key is piles of coconuts. It is absolutely undoubted that the waiter is ready to pick up the first-hand coconut milk on the spot! The overall environment of the restaurant is still good. The waiters are very diligent and change the plates without being greeted. I wanted to go to the gym and step on the treadmill to do aerobics. However, it is a pity that it is closed because of the epidemic. Come again when I have a chance.

After the investigation, I moved to another suite soon. very quiet. So I am still very satisfied. I will book again next time I have a chance to go to Ningbo. Stayed here for a weekend because the location is really quite good and the metro station is very near. Most of the city centre attractions are within 10mins walk. The hotel itself is great. There's a swimming pool and gym which can be used for free as long as your a guest. The breakfast was supremely enjoyable, serving both western and Chinese foods buffet style. Regarding the service, I'd have to say I was very satisfied. Before my alarm bell went off for breakfast I was woken up by what sounds like repairs being made several floors up. I went down to reception to tell them about this and after some swift investigation they moved me into another room on the opposite wing of the hotel building. It was much more quiet. Hence, if I come to Ningbo again for another weekend, I will not hesitate to stay here again!

msg:I can see from the room that the room time has been a long time. But it is very charming and the service staff are very enthusiastic. This time I forgot to bring personal belongings, a telephone service staff quickly sent over for emergency, and informed the purchase location and hot water. It's really caring, and it feels like living at home.

msg:I want to take the children out, it is best to be close to the city, there is a swimming pool, the best room is spacious and smart, and then I chose Nanyuan, I did not book a new building, and I booked the main building (old building) from the driver's mouth, I learned that Nanyuan is Ningbo old five-star, I went to the intimate front desk to see the children with us upgraded to a suite, the most amazing thing is, as a Kohler staff, once into the bathroom, I feel very kind, the full Kohler bathroom, Liyihua retro hardware series, I have fully believed to be 5 stars!
     I have a little suggestion, the main building is a little old, the lights are a little old, it is not worth the renovation, it is recommended that the toilet can be replaced with a smart toilet cover (this is the only uncomfortable place for us, maybe the family used to use smart toilet) low cost, no need to start work, convenient and fast, Staying in comfort can be improved a lot; just a tip

The whole room was bright and refreshing, and it felt good, especially the facilities inside were intelligent and convenient. I also prepared hanging ear coffee inside. The weather is so hot, so I made a coffee in the air-conditioned room and watched TV when I didn’t want to go out. I felt quite comfortable hahaha.

It is relatively close to Moon Lake, Nantang Old Street and Tianyi Square. Especially thanks to the handsome guy Li*jian in the lobby. I lost my phone and helped to find it. The service attitude is very good. I will continue to live here next time I come to Ningbo.

msg:The bathtub in the room is very large. I took two children out to play in a room with a bathtub. It is convenient for the two children to take a bath, and it is also very comfortable to take a bath after playing for a whole day. There is a small refrigerator to keep some fruits and milk for children to keep fresh. The children’s clothes are washed and there are still a few hangers for the waiter to bring, but there is no place to hang on. The waiter will help us to tell us that there is a clothesline in the room. Pulling out to hang clothes, I didn't expect it to be so convenient. It's very considerate to have such convenient facilities in a small room.

It was clean and tidy. The bathtub in the room was really good. It was very comfortable to take a bath after a day of playing. The room was very quiet and I woke up naturally!

msg:帶着孩子去寧波比賽加跨年！挑選酒店，想着南苑酒店怎麼也是五星級的，再差也差不到哪裡去！結果是南苑讓我對五星級酒店有了一個可怕的新的認知！
位置：位置不錯！離高鐵站也不遠，去南塘老街步行十幾分鍾也就到了！

服務：還可以！畢竟也是掛牌五星級酒店

游泳池：水不是流動的！定好十點結束，九點四十五分工作人員就催着我們離開了！


設施：酒店介紹寫的是2019年裝修，實際上我住的是90年代的房間,要是復古風也OK的！可是不是復古，就是舊！非常舊！後來電話裏知道，他們酒店有三種類型的房型，有最早也就是90年代的房間，接下來是零幾年裝修的，再有就是部分2019裝修的。可是他們酒店介紹中衹寫了2019年，有種上當的感覺！入住酒店，首先，走道層高極低，我一五幾的女生輕輕一跳就能碰到天花板。進入房間，更是突破我的想象，小而悶，還有幸在牀頭櫃是抓到兩小衹帶翅膀的小蟲。空調吱吱作響卻不見風，叫來服務員，服務員説空調無法調節，因為設施老舊他們沒有換風系統，無奈我們關掉空調，打開一個非常小的小窗，説明一下，他們的落地窗還可以，景色不錯，就是因為整個都是落地窗，所以窗打不到，旁邊衹有一點點小口要可以打開。房間的硬件設施可以説趕不一上一星的經濟型酒店，由於沒有房間可以換了，也想着價格不是特別貴，就先住着。由於房間實在悶熱，我一晚上都沒有睡，到快早上六點才睡一會兒，孩子也是一晚上沒有睡好！原本第二天續住，果斷退房！退定單！第一次對一家酒店如此失望，也第一次對攜程的推薦失望！
附上一張凌晨三點窗外的照片！

最搞笑的是，打電話給客服説因為是中央空調，温度調不了。衹能給我們送一個電風扇。送來的電風扇也很**，發藍光聲音還很響。
床墊又厚又軟床又窄，總之各種沒法睡，一直到凌晨三四點睡不着。
半夜睡不着翻酒店差評，我看到也有類似的一條差評在抱怨房間悶熱。早點解決這個問題比打電話發訊息要求客人給好評靠譜得多。

二十樓視野很好，新式裝修，掛耳咖啡味道也很棒，比第二天定的1700的酒店的東西好很多，外賣也不用自己下樓取，每個服務員都很熱情服務。地理位置也不錯，可以步行到南塘老街，走路大概十分鐘。下次如果去寧波還會再定這裏。

交通方便，臨近寧波站，樓下有公交站，走五分鐘到達四號線興寧橋西站。如果喜歡走路可以走一段路到月湖。

入住前要求高樓層的，酒店也提供了。房間添了茉莉花香的香薰，感覺很舒服。每天有水果贈送，還有一個小甜品。有一個要吐糟的地方是洗手盆，洗手時水很容易濺出來，而且衹有香皂，沒有洗手液，很不方便。

下一次來寧波的也會選擇的，反正同價位的，衹有它是五星的。

其實來之前就知道這就酒店比較老了，沒指望太多，但還是很失望。
1.酒店旁有在建工地，早上7點就開始施工
2.空調基本沒效果。
3.酒店無線信號真的差，兩個手機信號都不滿。這我覺得非常不應該，老酒店裝潢什麼的老我都不介意了但是這個無線明明能改進的都不想弄。
比較驚喜的是酒店房間有雨傘正好下雨自己沒帶，小東西也準備的比較齊全。

但房間內的細節部分，還不如商務酒店。
1.透明茶壺裡有明顯上個客人喝剩下的茶漬
2.浴室衞生很差，電吹風破舊程度已經讓人不敢使用，水漬等也到處都是
3.床單、被單有味道，枕頭也是一股鴨毛？鵝毛味道？
4.通往商務樓的過道里，瀰漫著游泳館消毒水的味道

酒店設施不錯，服務基本有問有答，有要求都能滿足，但個別服務員可能是新手。業務不熟需要詢問他人，入住第一天客房服務電話總是忙音打不進，向總枱反應後有改正。

msg:我們連住了11晚，感到這個飯店在硬件設施和軟件管理方面存在不少問題：
一、硬件方面。房間內設施老舊，而且無法修復，嚴重影響客人生活、休息。例如，房內屋頂漏水，修不好，衹能換房間，換了房間後，又遇上淋浴間積水無法排掉、房間內空調不致冷且滴水等問題，均無法修好。這樣的房間根本不能住人。
二、軟件方面。第一，管理人員講謊話。例如，房間內空調不致冷而且滴水，問大堂副理張女士這是什麼水，她竟回答説“這是蒸餾水”，知識淺薄讓人笑掉大牙；向前台要當天的報紙閲讀，值班經理***先是説“郵局今天報紙沒有送來”，後來又把報紙拿來了，問是什麼原因，他竟回答説“不能告訴你”；我們有事找當晚的值班經理，大堂副理牟永輝回答説“下班了不能打電話給值班經理”。這些管理人員簡直是謊話連篇。
第二，服務人員態度冷冰冰。整個飯店從大堂前台人員到餐廳服務員，他們的臉上基本上看不到笑容，更不要説主動向客人打招呼，例如，吃早餐時進餐廳時，我們報了房號後，餐廳門口人員不説一句話衹是揮一下手。
第三，管理人員文過飾非搞小動作。例如，當我們向管理人員反映飯店存在的一些問題後，他們怕我們以後給他們差評，值班經理***竟對我們説“你們退掉攜程的預訂，我給你們房費打85折。”對此我們當即予以拒絕，表示我們不會拆攜程的台。
綜上所述，該飯店實在有損五星的牌子，是一個不值得信賴和入住的酒店。

……
另外，行政樓層房間內的WIFI信號弱，時有時無，作為一家五星級酒店，出現此類現象，實在不應該。望酒店工程部、電腦房加強服務意識，譬如在樓層增設路由器，讓賓客能有更好的流暢上網體驗。

設施：重新裝修有小度機器人很適合年輕人和不會用很複雜功能的老年人 衹要喊一聲隨時服務
服務：要給我的房間負責人打100分 有人情味兒的地方 不管是推薦還是自住 以後這附近我衹會住在這裏了

環境：酒店的速溶咖啡味道也很好 還送了很多水果 和糕點還有水壺可以保温我都很喜歡 120分哈哈哈 住的很開心

1淋浴間非常狹小，轉個身就會撞到玻璃，花灑是老式的固定噴頭，不是頂噴那種！而且水流小且分散，根本無法正常洗澡
2.馬桶也很破舊，第一次扔了一張紙在裏面，沖了整整四次這一張紙才沖走，簡直無語
3.房間昏暗，衹有幾個射燈，床頭，穿衣鏡前都是昏暗的，極度不方便，需要化粧拍片的慎選
4.房間里老舊的痕跡太重，不少地方不僅舊還看起來臟兮兮的
唯一值得誇一下的就是服務態度還可以，但是房間實在實在太差了，令人失望

msg:首先是停車問題，check in的時候我覺得就應該主動詢問車牌幫助錄入系統，這樣就避免了住客快出停車場了才知道不交停車費是需要系統錄入的問題；
然後入住的是商務樓，應該是年限比較久了，地毯都比較臟，房間門上的門牌號都掉了個數字下來…
因為帶了小孩，小朋友比較喜歡到處亂摸，房間內的設施包括電話機、鍾之類的都比較臟，電視機上面一層灰
其次不知道是不是設備老舊問題，空調晚上運行聲音比較大，影響到了長者睡眠
以上是不滿意部分，滿意部分是窗户很大，15樓的視野挺好
地理位置優越，去吃飯或者遊覽市內景點距離都比較近，車程基本上10分鐘都可以到
早餐雖然種類不多，但是味道做的不賴，佐粥小菜味道很好，煮的咖啡也不錯
而且服務人員態度都很nice，撤盤也很及時

推薦住新裝修的主樓，有小度智能音箱，智能控制家居，床頭還有書籍，手機充電線，窗外可以看城景，電視台還能看鳳凰衞視、HBO。位置也很好，靠近月湖和火車站。最想誇的是服務，歡迎水果、酸奶、綠豆糕，下午還有小點心。住過幾家五星級酒店，1000多2000多的，酒店工作人員的態度都沒有這家温暖。點贊！

1. 入住當天有送小水果，後來每天晚上還有小點心+酸奶。還有，管家説話真的很温柔
2. 一有問題找前台就好啦，當時我們有人燙傷了，前台立馬幫忙送來冰塊和塑料袋，真的很貼心
3. 早晚自助餐都算是很滿意的，質量不錯。不過有一個小建議哈，餐品的樣式要是能換一換就好啦，每天早餐都是一樣的😂

msg:1 晚上九點到達酒店，沒有迎賓，門口坐着玩手機。一句話都沒有
2 辦理入住的前台男生全程沒有和我説一句話，好像我欠他錢一樣
3 進去10樓商務樓房間，地毯臟的不成樣子，因為晚上，沒有在意，進入房間後，空調製熱不製冷！你敢相信這是40度的寧波嗎？無奈我出去吃了個夜宵，告訴前台那個男的空調問題，他説告訴工程部給我換房間
4 回來換房間換到了11樓，空調是涼了，空調和發動機的聲音一樣大，無線網網速慢的要命。睡醒了澡都沒洗我就匆忙換酒店了
5 第二天可能是酒店覺得不太好，給我打電話，問我入住體驗，和説我那邊商務樓就是那樣，我想問你為什麼當時不讓我去住那邊的樓呢？還説下次去給我升級房間？我真的不知道這五星是怎麼刷上去的。建議大家住新開的酒店吧
