msg:Great leisure time after my packed schedule this month. It has become a habit of mine to travel somewhere every month to escape the city chaos. The destination I chose this time is Sanya, as the weather is getting very cold in Northern China where I come from.
There are so many hotels in Sanya, it was really hard to decide which one to choose at the beginning. I really want to stay away from the noisy crowd, and when I see the scenery of ‚ÄúEdison‚Äù,  I believed this is the hotel that could bring me a peaceful time.
I was attracted by the building at the door as soon as I entered Edison. Edison is more like a perfect artwork than a five-star hotel only. The ingenious design of the door makes people can‚Äôt help to take a picture of it. Passing through a door without any tag, I found the reception. I got upgraded from king room to a deluxe room by Brady as it was my very first experience in Edison. 
When you open the door of the room, there is a feeling of returning the nature. The interior of the room looks clean and spacious, which calms me a lot from the previous busy life and turns on my vacation mode right away. Open the window in the balcony, the first thing greets my eyes are the blue ocean and the green coconut trees. The room is so comfy that makes me want to give up my travel plan and stays here forever. Thanks to Brady for the better experience, I chose to spend one more night in the Sky lounge. The designer clothing stores on the ground, the art gallery, and the international brand La Prairie are all settled in Edison. And also because of their existence, completes Edison.
I really enjoyed myself in Edison and had a great vacation there. Thanks Brady for the recommendation and I will come again.‚ù§Ô∏è

The esthetic of the hotel and our room was visually pleasing, clean and minimalistic. We enjoyed breakfast and dinner at the Market. Food was delicious, French toast and the French bread were two of my favorites at breakfast; poke bowl for dinner. However, our group did notice a dip in service during morning breakfast around 7:45-8:30am when what seemed like a tour group descended on the Market. At this time, hotel staff did not seat anyone so parties of 2 were sitting at tables for 6-8, and the breakfast buffet area seemed a bit wild. Other than that, it was a pleasant and relaxing trip for our entire family.

Because it happened to be the birthday of my little friend, she also gave us a very large mousse cake when we checked in, which was super delicious!! We are very satisfied with the two adults and two children. It is definitely a paradise for children to take a walk. The little friends had fun and the adults took pictures. ü§£ Then the food and beverage were also quite satisfactory. We had to catch a flight on the last day, and she packed a lot of breakfast for us. It was so thoughtful. I will come again in the future!!

The housekeeper Larry added me on WeChat and asked about the hotel time. He learned that one of us had a birthday and prepared birthday decorations. The elderly and children were very surprised. The housekeeper made people feel very comfortable and always showed up in time when needed. The waiters were also very friendly and always served with a smile. The breakfast was also great. The waiters introduced the dishes and asked in advance if there were any needs for hot tea or coffee. I stayed in the hotel with my baby for two days, played the bubble party, fed the big fish, played in the family pool and the seawater pool. The Jin restaurant and the beach barbecue tasted good, and there were no disappointments. We didn't even go to the beach for two days. We only had time to play on the sailboat and artificial beach, and we didn't go to the starry sky restaurant. I will definitely come again if I have the chance.

msg:The overall design of the hotel is so beautiful. There is a scene at every step, and there are countless photo spots. The Edition is the ceiling of Sanya hotels in my mind. The room is very large and the bed is a feature. Twin beds are the first choice for 4-year-olds. Two 1.5-meter beds can be put together to form a 3-meter bed. This is a rare configuration in Sanya and very comfortable! There are also various pillows, such as latex and buckwheat. You can ask the housekeeper if you need it. It is very comfortable. The children had a lot of fun playing between the children's pool, the artificial ocean and the beach. After breakfast, they started feeding the fish directly. They were fully discharged after a whole day of activities. They fell asleep as soon as they returned to the room at night. The beach in Haitang Bay is now much better than that in Yalong Bay. The long and thin beach is very suitable for children to dig sand. Moreover, the Edition does not feel the busy feeling of the hotel being full during the peak holidays. Compared with the noisy children in Yanlord next door, this place is more in line with the needs of our parents. The Edition is a hotel that can meet the needs of children to play and the relaxation and pleasure of adults on vacation. The hotel breakfast is also very good, better than the "Chestnut" in Yalong Bay. My wife's favorite hot and sour pork intestines are all you can eat, and the taste is very good! Xianhai Restaurant is also very delicious, and the children's meals and recommended dishes are first-class! The housekeeper Yarra is very attentive. She asks about your well-being every day, reminds you of activities, and gives you coconut drinks. The staff we met on the road basically nodded and said hello, which is very polite! My wife has already started planning to come to Edition again next time before she left the hotel. She is super satisfied!

msg:I have stayed in many luxury hotels at home and abroad, and I have stayed in almost all luxury hotels in Sanya many times. For resort hotels, this trip to the Edition Hotel is the most satisfying one for me in Sanya this time. This is inseparable from my follow-up experience of a series of services provided by the housekeeper Larry. For a good hotel, it is very important to cultivate the recognition of employees. It is precisely in Larry that I saw a hotel practitioner who perfectly demonstrated the culture of the Edition Hotel. He was positive and capable in dealing with things, which left a perfect ending for my last trip to Sanya. With his help, I saw the coordination ability of various departments of the Edition Hotel. Unlike another equally famous hotel in Sanya, it lacks even the most basic docking ability. This is something I admire and feel satisfied with. The Edition Hotel has the largest size, but at the same time, it should have the largest number of service staff. The greetings from employees on the road are incomparable to those of other hotels, and there are the most entertainment activities. The atmosphere of the entire hotel is relaxed and pleasant, which makes people relax. The most noteworthy thing is that Larry has a good grasp of the needs of the guests and helps the guests think in advance, whether before, during or even after check-in, the scale is very well grasped.
This hotel gave me a very good feeling, and I would like to praise Larry again. If such an employee does not get the support of the hotel, then I think it is not in line with the culture of Edition. I may choose Edition more often when I come to Sanya in the future!

The room described on the Internet is like a fast hotel, but I think it is quite good. It is simple and modern, with high-end toiletries and good smell. The cotton slippers are very comfortable, and they also gave us brand new sandals. The housekeeper Abby called and added WeChat one day in advance to ask if there were any needs. She also gave us a list of children's products for selection. After checking in, the necessary supplies were placed in the room in advance. After arriving at the hotel, from checking in to being sent to the room, she explained the other facilities of the hotel all the way. During the stay, she reminded us from time to time what time there were activities. It was very considerate.

I will continue to stay a few more nights when I come to Sanya next time. The room service was also very good. The room was cleaned during breakfast.

I have to say that everyone from the doorman to the waiter was enthusiastic and polite. The room was cleaned very carefully. We went to the beach several times a day. No matter how messy it was, the room was always clean when we came back, and the towels were all changed. Miss Evelyn provided enthusiastic service throughout the whole process, sent delicious food and coconuts ü••, and any questions raised at any time could be quickly resolved.

She contacted us the night before check-in and asked carefully if there was anything that needed to be prepared in advance. Since it was the child's birthday, she arranged the room layout very considerately and gave us wine and beef ****y. The child was very happy. Due to the high occupancy rate during the May Day holiday, the room was not cleaned when we went there in the afternoon. The lady took the children to the locker room to change into swimsuits so as not to miss the bubble pool party, and helped us arrange the room check-in as quickly as possible. During the whole process, she would ask for warm reminders from time to time at every time period. The breakfast dishes were rich, and the rice noodles cooked on site were simply delicious. I also happened to encounter a wonderful underwater performance in the lobby. There was a DJ and free drinks on site, which was a surprise. Thank you very much Miss Kitty for making this Edison stay experience full~

msg:I come to Sanya once a year to vacation with my family and pray at Nanshan Temple.
As a hotel owner, I have stayed at all five-star hotels in Haitang Bay, Sanya.
I have to say that the Sanya EDITION is really great.

environment:
The hotel has a very high-end feel, is simple and elegant, and is green and natural. Everywhere is a landscape, and there are large tracts of it.

facility:
The entertainment facilities are complete, and the Sky Bar infinity pool on the 15th floor, artificial seawater beach, and water sports are all worth checking out.

breakfast:
The breakfast has a complete range of dishes and a variety of dishes. I really like the Hainanese rice noodles and shrimp dumplings. I also love the freshly squeezed healthy juice.

Serve:
The concierge girl at the hotel was very nice and had a sweet smile. She also did a good job in sanitation services and even helped us store the items!

The children's playground here is commendable. The breakfast is rich in variety and there are many fresh fruits and freshly squeezed juices, etc. The local specialty breakfast has different styles every day. What's more, Kuria, the hotel's guest relations depar**ent, has cared for us and greeted us every day for three days since we checked in, helping us solve various problems. On the first day, she also sent two fresh coconut water and fruits to our room. It was very good. I will come to the Edition Hotel again next time.

msg:Every time, I sigh with my family that this place doesn't look like a hotel in 2016. The decoration style is simple and timeless. The hygiene is very good for people with mysophobia. Every time, I book a double bed with sea view. The bed is put together very well. Last year, I could still feel the gap in the middle. This year, it is so real. We once thought that we had changed to a super large mattress. The bed is super large, which is very necessary for taking care of children. It is very comfortable to sleep at night without disturbing each other. The environment is still very beautiful. Unfortunately, the weather was average this time. But it is not boring even on cloudy days. There are many activities. I want to thank Runki for his thoughtful arrangements every time I come. Welcome fruits, coconuts and cute little breads are welcomed when checking in. There is a large flow of people on 5.1, so we can check in early. It's great ~ Everyone greeted us with a smile. The experience is excellent. There is also a magical thing. The lady in the lobby took a photo for us. She also took some photos with her mobile phone. When we returned to the room at night, Runki had already printed them out and put them in the photo frame. It was beyond expectations because I didn't tell her the room number. Anyway, my husband and I didn't understand how she did it. What I love most is the words "welcome home". Well, it's heartwarming. I will come again next time

This May Day holiday of four nights and five days was all booked at the Edison. Before booking, I was worried that I would not be able to go because I was pregnant, so I bothered my guest relations specialist Sia many times. Sia also specially upgraded my room type. After checking in, she sent me a check-in guide, red wine and snacks, and a souvenir when I checked out. Woohoo üò≠Sia loves me
The second time I came to the Edison, I explored it fully, experienced the afternoon tea at three restaurants and the Starry Sky Bar, and spent almost the entire holiday in the hotel. Every staff member exuded kindness to us. When my husband, a swimming novice, was swimming, the lifeguard patiently taught him for nearly an hour. I was touched üò≠The cleaning lady gave us sunscreen and mosquito repellent, and also washed my husband's socks üò≠It was very relaxing and comfortable in the Edison. From now on, the Edison will be our happy hometown!

msg:Hotel design: As a top luxury hotel, there are many places in the public area that are suitable for filming, but there are not many internet celebrities, which is commendable.
Arrival: Concierges are all handsome men and beautiful women. They will never leave any luggage in the car. Every time they take a taxi in and out, they are also warmly greeted and asked about needs.
Reception: Our housekeeper Ashley accompanied us from the door to the room. She was very warm and asked us questions. She provided us with great convenience.
Check in: Ctrip booking only has two breakfasts. Ashley and the front desk helped me find the Marriott membership that I had not used for a long time and gave me breakfast for my children.
Room: The room design is very simple, the legendary "large all seasons", but after all, it is a top luxury, and the texture is still different. Although the room is large, it is still more suitable for couples. The air conditioning in the room is sufficient, and the Mini bar is free on the first day.
Breakfast: Every guest has a seat. Although there are many guests during the May Day holiday, it is busy but not chaotic. There are rich varieties of food and the overall taste is good.
Activities: There were many parent-child activities during the holiday. The children practiced surfing for the first time under the guidance of the coach and were very happy. The seawater swimming pool is also very unique. Although it rained on the second day, the children met playmates in the children's playground and had fun all afternoon.
Facilities: The gym is open 24 hours a day, and children are not allowed to bring children to the poolside bar. I just checked in when the children went to attend the course.
Disadvantages: Although it is an open suite and the room was booked more than a month in advance, the price of Ctrip only supports the room on the third floor.

The privacy is also very good, and ordinary people cannot enter casually. During these days of staying in the hotel, various Internet celebrities and Alcoa took pictures every day! However, there is no indoor swimming pool. It would be better if there is an indoor swimming pool. My little friend likes swimming very much. The weather was very cold in the first two days, so I didn‚Äôt dare to go swimming outdoors. I was afraid of catching cold when I ran there and back. I have basically eaten in several other restaurants. I feel that the taste of the restaurant is relatively average and the service is very good. However, several restaurants seem to be average, and the buffet breakfast is still good! Basically everything is available. The best thing is that we don't need to find a seat ourselves. The restaurant manager has arranged the seat. This is very good. We don't need to find it ourselves. Also, the refrigerator in the room does not make ice at all and is basically at room temperature. It would be better if it could be replaced with a new one along with the toilet.

msg:As an old guest of the Edition, I am very happy to see that the Sanya Edition has completely restored its pre-epidemic service. I come here several times a year, including during the epidemic. Although I enjoyed the beach and seawater swimming pool alone, the services in all aspects were indeed much worse. The cigarette butts next to the bathtub, the damaged and unrepaired facilities and equipment, and the lack of professionalism of the service staff made me doubt whether I could come again. With the occasional experience last year and this year, I can see that it is changing and constantly restoring the previous standards and requirements. This time, I accidentally saw Jordi collecting the tables while eating in the restaurant. As a hotel executive, he is still on the front line, working smoothly and efficiently. Two tables of bowls and chopsticks were instantly received on a tray. These ordinary employees should really learn from each other. I can feel that the executive team of the Sanya Edition is doing a solid job. Sometimes before coming back, I will inadvertently ask if Mr. Yuan is still there. I feel more at ease to stay in the Sanya Edition when I heard that he is still there. I originally thought that such standards were the genes of the Edition, but after going to the Shanghai Edition several times in the past two years, I felt that the standards of Sanya were due to the management of Mr. Yuan's team. The service industry is a test of people's quality, and we expect it to get better and better, with constant surprises. There may be many new people in the front office depar**ent, and we continue to look forward to the front office depar**ent returning to its original warm and sunny attitude and service.

Before checking in, he would communicate by phone and add WeChat to understand our needs and arrival time, arrange the pick-up vehicle, and arrange the room in advance. Because we stayed for three nights and brought children, housekeeper Cui directly put a box of water in the room and installed a bed guard. After checking in, all the problems and requests we raised were solved as soon as possible, and he was very serious and responsible! When checking in, in order to let us wait less, he directly helped me upgrade the floor of the room, and when checking out, he also prepared a rest room and delayed check-out for us! 
The staff in every place in the hotel are very nice, take the initiative to say hello, and ask if you need help! When eating in the restaurant, the waiter will help take care of the children as long as he is busy. 
My children are playing in the children's playground, and the staff will do their best to take care of them, especially patient and gentle. This is something I didn't expect at all. 
In addition, the hotel's hosting service is also very good. My two children are not enough for two consecutive days of hosting and want to continue playing. 
The service by the pool also surprised me. I worked by the pool for two hours, delivered fruits twice, and pizza once, all for free! 
This stay at the Edition gave our family so many surprises and wonderful experiences, it has risen to the top of our list! üòÅ

Although it is an Internet celebrity store, the facilities are still brand new, which also makes our experience better.

The back door of the hotel leads directly to the beach, which is very convenient. You can have a lot of fun without leaving the hotel. The restaurants are also delicious and great value for money.

msg:I took my parents on vacation and made a reservation a few days in advance. The hotel upgraded me to the best adjacent room with sea view. It was so beautiful and very considerate. You can feel the warm and professional service from the moment you get off the car. The concierge and front desk are great. The butler Kuria provides full service tracking, shares information and provides help. It is my first time to come to the Sanya EDITION and it feels like going home! The breakfast of Bao Luo Noodles and Beef Brisket Fatty Intestine were very satisfying to my taste. I swam at the beach club for three consecutive days in the afternoon and loved it so much. It‚Äôs beautiful to take pictures everywhere, and I want to come back as soon as I leave.

The pool is very comfortable. I went there twice and there was no one there. It was very comfortable. , we booked a high-rise sea view room, the balcony view is very good, you can have fun all day without leaving the hotel. The wind at the beach is a bit strong, so be sure to keep warm. It was so gloomy the past two days that my family caught colds and had throat inflammation. The hotel is in a good location. It is only a ten-minute walk from the duty-free shop. The road to the duty-free shop is very congested. Parking is also a big problem. There is almost no parking space nearby. The security guidance is also very problematic. It takes 40 minutes for everyone to go in and drive around. I parked in the Four Seasons parking lot far away, and walked if I could. It was still very crowded when the store closed at 22 o'clock in the evening.
Service: Very considerate. There is a butler who can be contacted at any time via WeChat.

The package includes 2 breakfasts and a dinner buffet, but other things in the hotel are also delicious. The room is large, and the 1.5 double bed just meets the needs of a family of four.

msg:There are countless luxury hotels in Haitang Bay, Sanya. It is not easy to choose a hotel that suits you. But if you come to Sanya mainly to stay in a hotel, you really need to spend time to choose a satisfactory hotel.

After reading reviews on Ctrip, Xiaohongshu, **, and Weibo for a long time, I finally chose the Sanya Edition Hotel. It turns out that I made the right choice.

The Edition Hotel, like Bulgari and Ritz-Carlton, belongs to the Marriott Group and is Marriott's top luxury brand. The room price also exceeds that of the Ritz-Carlton in Yalong Bay. Many users on Ctrip have given high praise to the Edition. I will comment on the environment and service I have felt.

Environment: Sanya Edition is located in the C position of Haitang Bay. There is an artificial ocean in the hotel. You can enjoy the large coconut trees and the beautiful ocean without leaving the hotel. Of course, the Edition is on the coast. If you want to go out of the hotel to enjoy the sea view, it only takes a few minutes to walk. Most of the rooms in the Edition can enjoy the sea view. It should not be perceived by language description alone. I posted some pictures I took.

Service: This is the best feeling and the best experience during this stay. From the moment you arrive at the lobby, your exclusive service begins. The guest relations lady Zoe who provided me with butler service this time was very enthusiastic, friendly, and highly professional. Zoe will give a lot of suggestions for staying, dining, and playing, and will carefully inform every precaution. During the stay, if you have any questions, including restaurant reservations, you can contact Zoe. Thank you very much to Miss Zoe for making this stay at the Edition a great experience.

I will recommend the Edition Hotel to my friends, and of course I will stay again if I have the chance.

Sanya Edition, see you next time.

With two children, I often need to trouble the housekeeper to arrange it. Before coming, I confirmed with the hotel that the sea-view floor and two sets of children's toiletries. The room I stayed in has a front view of the sea, and the sea view is super beautiful. Many people complain that the room looks like the All Seasons, but I don't think so. The overall decoration is very a**ospheric, just light luxury style, haha. Every day, the children participate in the hotel's free activities, surfing, kayaking, making handicrafts, etc., and the children are very happy. There are three swimming pools on the ground and one with starry sky, and every child loves to play. The family swimming pool has a booster for rent, which is very fun. On the day of check-out, because I had to go to Wanning to do something, I didn't want the children to toss with me, so I confirmed with Kitty that I needed to check out later. Kitty was very awesome and helped me apply for it. Thank you very much! When checking out, I also gave the children gifts, coloring books and crayons, so that the children would not be bored on the three-hour flight. In short, I will come again next time. üòä

The room was clearly arranged with beautiful views and high floors. I also liked the small backpack for my baby! I sent my baby to a daycare center, but the child kept saying that he hadn't played enough and wanted to go again! Now those who clock in at the lobby are not allowed to enter, which is really good! The Edison listened to my advice, haha. I will stay here again next time I come to Sanya!

I look forward to having the opportunity to experience parent-child activities in the future haha

The children's playground is very new and fun. The swimming pool is also very comfortable and clean.
The EDITION swimming pool and outdoor attendants will help you lay out towels on your lounge chairs and provide water, mosquito repellent, and swimming rings (the beach pool also has many sand digging tools for children to play with). There is a children's playground on the G floor of the hotel. Children have many activities and are free. parents
The bed in the sea-view twin room is very large. It is highly recommended. The hotel also provides children's beds, which reduces the burden of traveling with children.
The overall service is still good
For four days and three nights, every meal was provided by the hotel and the meals were OK.
Jin Restaurant is relatively crowded, and Tianlu Restaurant is highly recommended. It has a small outdoor environment and is quiet. The a**osphere is very good at night.

I looked at the online reviews and found mixed reviews. Some said it was good, while others said it was an IQ tax. With a feeling of trepidation, I booked a hotel. On the first day of our stay, we got a call from the hotel. We thought there was something wrong, but it turned out that a housekeeper had contacted us and asked us to add WeChat. In fact, I was quite dissatisfied. I had already made plans to go out for fun, so I didn‚Äôt need a housekeeper at all. I asked my child to add his WeChat account.
After the plane landed, we arrived at the hotel smoothly. The hotel was nestled among a large green tree. When we arrived at the front lobby, the butler Kurtis took the initiative to greet us. He took us and introduced us to the overall facilities, environmental features, and heritage and culture of the EDITION. Various features are explained.
We were immediately interested in Addison.
In addition, when you stay at the hotel, you can get 50% off on shopping at duty-free shops. It is an unexpected bonus that you can reach the duty-free shop within an 8-minute walk. I learned that we were going to the duty-free shop,
Kurtis even took the initiative to help us apply for a 50% discount and informed us that the hotel has a shuttle service.
As for other sightseeing and food, Kurtis turned into a jack-of-all-trades and solved many trivial matters easily, which made our trip to Sanya a smooth one.
Soon, the trip was over, and when we left reluctantly, we suddenly found that we had left our clothes in the hotel cabinet. Kurtis contacted the relevant personnel in time and sent the clothes back to us.
In short, this trip to Sanya has planted the EDITION Hotel, and I applaud the EDITION Hotel for having an outstanding employee like Kurtis. If any friends come to live in the Edition, I highly recommend an excellent housekeeper like Kurtis. His integration will definitely make everyone's trip worthwhile and they will return home satisfied!

My wife was very happy when she entered, and the hotel later gave her two Coconut, it‚Äôs really great - ÃóÃÄ(‡πë·µî‚åî·µî‡πë) I booked a meal at the hotel‚Äôs Western restaurant for dinner, and my wife also said that the food tasted good and was deliciousüòÑ In short, it‚Äôs hard to express my love for this hotel in words I will recommend it to my friends and will definitely stay a few more days next time (ÔΩ°√≤ ‚àÄ√≥ÔΩ°)

They were very nice and upgraded my room type when I checked in. Your smiles also made me feel warm and happy when I arrived here for the first time.

The coconut and pineapple buns with logos were given and they were delicious. I told the housekeeper Emma because I didn't take a photo, and another one was sent the next day. The breakfast is very rich. The baby can eat eggs, steamed buns, and vegetable puree as a complementary food. The hotel is a beautiful place where you can take pictures wherever you go. The hotel rooms are clean and hygienic. We didn‚Äôt get to have a family pool bubble party because we had to take a nap! The small train rides once a day.

msg:I have stayed in almost all the good hotels in Sanya, so I have more say. I was deceived by the pictures on the Internet before and always felt that the Edison style was too simple. This time I checked in on the spot. It is true that the photos are not dominant and I visited on the spot. Only then can we see that the texture, taste and smell of the hotel are unique. It is very stylish and textured. The smell is also specially developed by the lelabo brand for EDITION. It can only be smelled here. A good hotel really pays attention to the details. Above, the overall decoration style of the Sanya EDITION Hotel is modern and simple, but it also has a sense of design. The garden combines subtropical style. I checked into the very popular stylish studio suite with full sea view at the front desk. I was really not disappointed and very satisfied. The balcony is very large and the bathtub is also very large. The fruit given was very considerate and a small bottle of Lelabo perfume was given as a gift, which was great.
In particular, I would like to praise the housekeeper Ashley Lili who received us. She was a very considerate girl. She checked us in at the front desk and sent us to the room. She introduced the basic situation of the hotel and the features of the room in detail, which really made me see the professional service. level. During my stay, he helped me apply for duty-free shop discount services and actively answered any questions I encountered, which was greatüëç
Room condition:
The room is spacious and bright, with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãmore than 70 square meters according to visual inspection. There is a bathtub on the balcony, making it very comfortable to stay.
When you return to the hotel and take a comfortable bath, you can see a glimpse of the sea through the floor-to-ceiling windows.
I will continue to choose it next time I come back, recommendedüåπ

After checking in, before we even came out of the room, we went to the sky bar for a drink. The kids swam for 2 days and played with everything they could.

Dinner There is a seafood barbecue and a Western restaurant with delicious Spanish food. We, who are picky about food, are very satisfied! The waiter was also very considerate and chatted with the children. The room furnishings were somewhat Japanese-style. During my stay, I was knocked twice by the corner of the bed because I was not familiar with the room facilities... I felt very sore at night and bought band-aids to deal with it. I later went to the front desk to get a replacement. I mentioned this by the way when checking in, and didn't think anything of it, but the hotel took it very seriously. A manager immediately contacted me, sent medicine and fruit, and delayed check-out. All in all, it's worth choosing next time!

The hotel is big but not boring at all
I went to have breakfast at around nine o'clock yesterday morning
I saw rowing boats and paddleboards not far away, so I went to play for a while.
We went further and saw the seawater swimming pool and played there for a while.
Further ahead is the beach. I played there for a while.
When you are tired of playing, go to the beach club to eat and drink.
Then he lay down and rested at the pavilion on the roadside waiting for takeout.
It was already three o'clock in the afternoon when we got to the room after eating.
You can really live a good life without going out at all
The beach chairs and pavilions all have QR codes for ordering.
The room also has 24-hour room service
The breakfast is very good. Highly recommend the rice noodles. Very good~
It really does everything a resort hotel should have and you can have a lot of fun without going out.
The rooms are also very good. All rooms in the hotel have full sea views.
The New Year‚Äôs Eve party was also fun
I have stayed in many hotels in Sanya. It is really the ceiling of Sanya hotels.
As for the damp rooms or poor service criticized by many people online
I haven't encountered it yet, but I'm quite satisfied with it.
It is recommended to stay for 2-3 days to fully experience the EDITION.
The only choice to come to Sanya in the future~~~

msg:I came here for the first time in 2019 and for the second time during New Year's Eve in 2023. It's a very good hotel. The reason why I came here for the second time is because the first stay experience was particularly good, but overall I feel that the Edition is not suitable for parents and children. Traveling is suitable for high-end business people, young couples, Internet celebrities, etc. Young and beautiful single women in revealing clothing or young couples who act boldly and ignore the feelings around them in and out of the hotel will not conform to the existing values ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äãof the children, and the children will also I wanted to experience the infinity pool on the top floor, but when I went up, my clothes were exposed and the little girls checking in and taking photos couldn't get enough of it. I went straight downstairs in the elevator. The children's water park was occupied by some young couples who occupied the slides, which made the children's experience feel straight. Decline, the above mentioned has nothing to do with the hotel, it is just that the current social phenomenon makes the stay uncomfortable. The hotel service is five-star. Yarra, the hotel's dedicated service, picks up the hotel from the hotel for free. It arranges the children's birthday decorations and gives birthday cakes. The details are meticulous. Every matter is responded to in a timely manner and arranged as much as possible to let the guests feel the warmth of home. The children like the gifts. Pea shooter squirt gun. I wanted one with my family, so they gave us two sets of backpacks! The only small suggestion is that some activities and consultations require guests to communicate with various depar**ents. If this barrier can be broken through, guests will have a greater sense of belonging. There will be no fireworks show at night during New Year's Eve, but the light show and drone show will be shocking. One more thing The door of the hotel room is too thick, and it is very difficult for girls to open and close it. With the wind pressure, it is easy to hit or lock it. The shower is super powerful, the shower head is super big, the water flow is large, the temperature is right, it is super comfortable to wash, and the bathtub is also special. It's a pleasure. You should leave space for your mobile phone or iPad next to it. The experience of spending money on games in the children's play area is not very good. The children cried because they spent a lot of money and failed to catch the doll. The staff who helped pick up and drop off luggage when entering and leaving the store were very helpful, but our suitcase was overweight. When we left the store, all the wheels were broken and we could hardly drag it around. I don't know if it was because we used too much force when carrying it or because the wheels were old. The driver who took us to the airport bus was very warm and enthusiastic, but the bus was not powerful and had no air conditioning. It was boring all the way. The waiter in the lobby was very professional and helped us take photos very well. He also gave us instructions on how to take pictures. The suggestions given by the waiter were very professional and the photos were taken. The effect is also very satisfactory! The hotel's breakfast is very rich. We usually go downstairs around eight o'clock. After finishing at 9:30, we go upstairs without eating at noon. It is really rich. The buffet seafood hot pot for dinner is okay. The ingredients are fresh, updated in a timely manner, and the service is good. Changed 2 times of alcohol stove, there is a lot to rinse, and you will be full quickly after eating, so you need to eat it in a targeted way, and the price/performance ratio is low. If you can't go to the sea for a while, you can dig some sand at the beach. It's not a good idea to be harassed by horseback riders taking pictures on the beach. The lawn is very comfortable, and it's super comfortable to sit on the beach chairs and enjoy the sea breeze. Overall satisfied, there is still room for improvement, very satisfied with Yarra‚Äôs exclusive service! Try it again next time without the kids!

The housekeeper Runki was very attentive in helping us take care of our various needs and also upgraded our room type for free. I personally think the most attractive thing about this hotel is the private beach, where you can see the endless skyline, and there are moderate wind and waves to feel the power of the sea. Access is limited to hotel guests, so there are not many people, so it is much more convenient to take pictures. , it is easy to select a pure picture. Just for this beach, I will come again! Finally, I would like to make a small suggestion. I am already a Platinum Diamond hotel. Can I upgrade to a smart toilet?

I was torn between the Edition and Atlantis for a long time, and finally I chose the Edition. It was the right choice. It has complete parent-child facilities and four or five restaurants. The hotel is very comfortable, not crowded, and I feel comfortable everywhere. I caught up with the New Year light show and DJ performance, and it was a more successful New Year's Eve.

First, we were told that the room had been cleaned and we could check in directly. Second, we were upgraded to a room that we had originally booked. I got a double bed with sea view because I added the housekeeper on WeChat the day before. After communicating, I hoped to change it to a king bed room. When I checked in, I was upgraded to a better king bed with sea view. The room was very comfortable, with separate rooms and balconies. A big bathtub with a beautiful gauze curtain. The waiters in the entire hotel are very nice, the facilities are very complete, and the staying experience is very comfortable. I will stay for a few nights next time and the experience will be even better. The housekeeper Sia is very considerate and can solve all problems in time!

Every service staff will say hello, and the greeting guy is very considerate and enthusiastic. He opens the door to pick up luggage, calls for a taxi, and is very considerate.

It is very convenient to wear what to wear when going to the beach. The heated swimming pool and starry sky bar are very good, as well as an amusement park and water entertainment facilities suitable for children. The hotel is more suitable for young couples. In short, I am very satisfied. I saw a lot of bad reviews before coming here. After coming, I still feel that it is worth the money. Maybe I am not very picky... There are many beautiful ladies in the hotel hahahaha

msg:After more than a year of planting in the Addison, I finally pulled the ****s. This time I would like to post a very real experience. After staying in Yate for four nights, I came to the Addison and stayed for five nights. I deeply experienced every corner of the Addison. There are indeed many hotels in the red spots. The lobby is filled with various internet celebrities taking photos. The hotel's internet celebrity style is strong, and it feels like all kinds of monsters are entering Pansi Cave. The first point is that the wind in Haitang Bay is too strong. The hotel lobby, restaurant, children's playground, elevator hall are almost all empty. The open type is really blown and messy in the wind. The children are also blown by the wind when playing in the children's playground. It seems that the design of the hotel did not take into account the windy Haitang Bay. It is okay when the weather is good, but most of Haitang Bay is windy. The door of the room was often blown and banged. The second point was that the room facilities were really fast. The hotel's price of more than 5,000 during the New Year's Day holiday was really not worth it. The bathroom felt cheap and the floor was uneven. The tiles and carpet were dirty. It was uncomfortable to step on and the cleaning was relatively perfunctory. The third issue was that the sound insulation was not good. I was disturbed by the sound of decoration in the afternoon of the first day. I called the customer service to tell them that the children were taking a lunch break in the afternoon. Fortunately, the sound was stopped in time and no more noise occurred on the first day of check-in. The feeling is not very good. Although there are many people staying in Yate, there is no sound from upstairs and corridors in the room. Addison makes a loud sound of dragging tables and beds at night. It may be that the new guests are sharing beds for the New Year's Eve party. The sound was so loud that it felt like entering a huge nightclub. The atmosphere was there, but the guests' feelings were not taken into consideration. The noise made them unable to sleep in the room until 2 o'clock at night, which greatly compromised the quality of the hotel.
The advantage is that it is really photogenic and the garden view is also good. It is suitable for young people who want to take photos. If you want to pursue a quality stay, don't choose it.

In terms of design, the hotel has pleasant scenery, with every step of the way creating a tropical sea view. Moreover, the hotel has starry sky swimming pool, infinity swimming pool, constant temperature swimming pool, salt water swimming pool, etc. There will always be one suitable for you and your relatives and friends. This place is really clean and easy to take pictures.
Originally, I booked a normal room type, but due to hotel issues, the hotel upgraded me to a room type. The bed and sofa on the balcony of the new room are very unique and comfortable. It is really pleasant to listen to the sound of the waves on the balcony at night.
For the evening turndown service, the housekeeper prepared a beautiful kitten doll, which made my baby very happy.
In terms of the overall experience of the hotel, it is an expensive, high-end place where you can get services if you have money. It‚Äôs really good to follow the trend and experience it once in a while.

It was like a heavy rain and the entire balcony was covered with water. The cleaning staff came over and wiped the water away. Then we threw away all the food because we didn‚Äôt know what kind of water it was. It was very dirty. The manager sincerely gave us a small gift the next day and said that we could upgrade the room type for breakfast next time we stayed. There were also many Internet celebrities wearing full makeup to take photos and check in. I felt out of place with them. The front desk gave us a small dessert. It was delivered in person, and it was quite delicious because the room was not ready until almost 5:00. Maybe because there are too many internet celebrities.

I booked a stylish suite. My children loved playing in the large bathtub on the balcony. Afterwards, the hotel upgraded us to the Tinghai Suite for free, which was also very comfortable. The hotel garden is great, the breakfast is delicious, and the staff are very nice to the children. It is worthy of the Haitang Bay ceiling. I will stay here again next time!

After waiting for more than an hour to check in, the housekeeper gave us a bottle of red wine to express his apology. The environment of the hotel is very good and the space is large. You can just spend a day or two in the hotel!

The room faces the sea directly. There is also a shuttle bus to the duty-free shop. There is a drone show on New Year's Day. Watching the sunrise in the morning is also very novel and romantic. Highly recommended.

msg:My first time staying at the Edition was a great experience. The hotel environment is very good, very beautiful, and everything looks like a painting when you take a photo. The service is so good that I can't say enough. Kevin, the butler, contacted me before check-in and thoughtfully informed me of the hotel's restaurants, activities and various services so that I could understand and plan in advance. After check-in, he responded quickly to all my needs. Thank you very much for the attentive and thoughtful service, which made me feel very good about the hotel. We booked a swimming pool villa and communicated in advance that we wanted to float on an inflatable float. When we checked in, we saw the inflatable mounts thoughtfully prepared by the housekeeper for the children. The children were very happy. This feeling of putting the needs of the guests at heart is very warm, thank you Kevin. The aunt who cleans the room is also very nice. The room is super clean and she responds quickly to any needs. Another thing I must praise is the breakfast at the EDITION. It is really the best and richest among the five hotels I stayed at in Sanya this time. All in all, it was a perfect experience. I will definitely choose this hotel every time I come to Sanya in the future.

As a result, the services, facilities, catering and children's activities of the Edition were beyond imagination! Thanks to Helen for contacting us in advance and providing sufficient and timely hotel information. After the room upgrade, the view is very good. Even though the weather has cooled down, the view of the artificial lake and seaside is still spectacular! During the Chris**as period, DJs, bands and light shows filled the a**osphere, and the children‚Äôs activity center‚Äôs gingerbread houses and music box productions won the hearts of the children! There are not many types of breakfast, but everything is delicious. We recommend the freshly cooked rice noodles and various vegetables! I am very satisfied with the taste and scenery of Xianhai Restaurant! The staff were very welcoming throughout the process and helped push luggage in and out!

msg:Two adults and two children chose to stay in a villa with a swimming pool.

The housekeeper Bruce is a very enthusiastic young man. After booking the room in advance, he contacted me to make an appoin**ent for airport pick-up, reminded me to book restaurants in advance, etc. His services were very considerate. During my stay, I was craving for coffee, so I ordered the hotel's manner coffee, and the housekeeper also fetched the coffee for me and delivered it to the room.

The welcome dessert on the first night was delicious, but it was a pity that it was not provided later. A cake and dessert platter was given on Chris**as Eve. Snacks in the mini bar are also provided free of charge. The hotel does not have a private beach, but you can go out by swiping your room card if you want to go to the beach. However, the waves are very strong, so those with children should take care of them. The hotel has an artificial beach, which is suitable for babies. As our children are older, they are not satisfied with the artificial beach.

It's a pity that the hotel's breakfast room doesn't get sunlight and is relatively dark. It's a pity that we can't enjoy the comfortable experience of enjoying a delicious breakfast in the sunshine and blowing the sea breeze. The breakfast table is placed a bit close to the meal taking area, so there is a lot of crowding and shouting when taking the meal, which makes the experience not good.

The mattress in the hotel is not very supportive. I don‚Äôt know what brand of mattress it is. For people with protruding waist, the comfort of the hotel depends on a good mattress. Unfortunately, the Edison does not have one.
The hotel's turndown service was also very perfunctory. Families with children do not experience other humanized services.

I have stayed at Capella and Sun Bay Park Hyatt in Sanya, and all of the above are better than the Edition. The Sun Bay Park Hyatt Hotel provides breakfast in separate areas for guests in the villa area, which raises the experience to a higher level. Can the EDITION learn from this?

I originally wanted to give a good review, but in the end it turned into a comment. I hope Addison can get better and better!

The room is fully equipped and the equipment for the children is also very thoughtful.
And the most important thing to say is the service, butler Xiao Cui really perfectly interprets what five-star service is. There is nothing we can't think of, and there is no car pick-up and drop-off that he can't do. Not to mention the small requests of the children, they are also very satisfied. Perfect trip.

msg:First-class hardware, premium service. Simple but not extravagant. Careful and refined. This is how I felt about staying at the Addison.
From advance customer relations service to check-in service, room service, restaurant service, and bar service, they all reflect the standard of a first-class hotel. The service is sincere, not a fake WeChat show. Have the feeling of being respected and the surprises given every day
Here is a special mention for Yarra from the Guest Relations Service Depar**ent. From the advance communication and needs the day before check-in, to the greeting at the door when checking in, to the introduction into the guest room, it all reflects the professionalism, attentiveness, details and service of a guest relations person. After moving in, the daily care and small surprises given every day reflect the attentive service of an EDITION person. Therefore, I give the evaluation of the hotel's special service.
When I came to Sanya before, I stayed at Capella. I have never dared to try the Edison because I heard that the hotel has a simple style and Internet celebrity style. This time I stayed in the Edison for 3 nights with an experimental mentality. I didn‚Äôt have any unnecessary worries. The style of the room is indeed simple, but by no means simple and luxurious. The hotel's internal and external environment is truly stunning. The food and drinks are delicious and the staff are very attentive. Compared to Capella, Addison's service is more real and friendly. So I will definitely choose Addison in the future.

msg:I have stayed in many hotels in Sanya, including Park Hyatt, Mandarin Oriental, Capella, St. Regis, Banyan Tree, etc. Generally speaking, they all have their own strengths, but I can only say that they are quite satisfactory. But this stay at the EDITION brought unexpected surprises and was unforgettable. Let‚Äôs talk about the environment first. The hotel is located in Haitang Bay, and the beach is naturally not as good as Yalong Bay. However, the hotel spent a lot of money to build an inner lake for water sports, which made up for this shortcoming. The public area surrounds this artificial ocean. It is not large, but it is carefully designed and full of fashion. It is very suitable for Internet celebrities to check in and take photos. Let‚Äôs talk about the room. The sky garden suite we stayed in this time has a 270-degree sea view and a large terrace of nearly 100 square meters. The decoration of the room is in a modern and simple style. There are mixed reviews online, but I personally like it very much. As for dining, I tried 3 restaurants in the hotel this time. The daily breakfast buffet at Jin Restaurant is very rich and even has a variety of ice cream flavors to choose from. There are many guests, but the management and service are tight and orderly. The night view of Xianhai Restaurant is unparalleled and the taste is also very good. I personally think it is one of the best Chinese restaurants in Haitang Bay and even Sanya. The beach barbecue restaurant is full of tropical style, the chef is Indonesian, and the taste is very authentic, except that it is not as spicy as local Indonesian food. I don‚Äôt really like seafood barbecue. I think all grilled seafood tastes the same, but I still highly recommend this restaurant. It‚Äôs very unique. The entire hotel is also very child-friendly. Because we were staying with a baby, the sharp corners of all the furniture in the room were processed, and the bed was also surrounded by bed surrounds, which was very considerate. The hotel also has a heated children's swimming pool, a bubble party starting at 4 p.m. every day, free pizza, and a free train ride. During the breakfast buffet, there were people giving balloons to the children. The children's playground is large and has many projects. More importantly, it is open until 10 p.m. It's such a stark contrast to the Capella next door that kicks people off at 6 o'clock. Of course, the most amazing thing is the hotel's service. Personally, I think the hotel's service is at the highest level in China and ranks among the top five. It is second only to Aman Yangyun, Four Seasons at West Lake, and the Mandarin Oriental in Pudong, Shanghai when it first opened, among the four Aman hotels in China. Special thanks to our butler Winnie for her warm, thoughtful and meticulous service. Confirm the itinerary and make restaurant reservations from the day before departure. On the day of check-in, you will be picked up by BMW i7 and the room will be decorated. They arranged every day's itinerary after check-in, and even though we were on vacation on the last day, they still cared about our check-out and drop-off at the airport, making our family have a pleasant and unforgettable vacation. Next time we come to Sanya, we will definitely choose EDITION.

Special thanks to Miss Winnie for taking such good care of us, just like our friends! The room was very considerate and carefully decorated with small gifts. It was really great. Even when I was on vacation, they didn't forget to ask me about my needs. They followed up promptly and made reservations for restaurants for me. They also connected various depar**ents so that I had a good experience. Everyone was very enthusiastic and professional. The butler is really great, the angel butler! I originally wanted to stay longer, but the rooms are full later. I feel like no matter which hotel I choose, I feel that there is a gap. It really spoils me.
Breakfast is really what motivates me to get up early! The variety is rich and tastes great. The combination of Chinese and Western freshly ground coffee really replenishes the energy for the day. The beach barbecue is also delicious. The Indonesian style environment is very chill. There are also resident singers to enhance the a**osphere. There are also various buyer shops and boutiques such as Dior for children. Hosting and other services, you won‚Äôt feel bored while visiting the hotel without leaving home. Then there are the swimming pools. There are 4 swimming pools in total (if I remember correctly). The beach club has cocktails and DJ. You can come and chat with friends. The starry sky bar is also very good and will adjust according to you. Recommended for my taste. The products are very good. The large swimming pool is also a good choice for night swimming. I will choose to come to the Addison next time. It is really a ceiling soap and it is very good.

msg:This is my second hotel in Sanya. As a five-star island resort, the overall facilities, environment and services are decent. I was upgraded to a room free of charge. The color of the room is simple, refreshing and quiet. My butler Yarra is attentive and has good communication! The food in the hotel is quite satisfactory, with occasional surprises. I wonder if it will be adjusted as the seasons change. It is inconvenient to travel during the rainy season. There seems to be nothing else to do in the hotel except the gym, which is a bit boring. Overall, the experience is very good. I will choose to stay here next time I go to Sanya!

As for the room type, the master bedroom is very large and the second bedroom is smaller. It is unscientific for the outdoor swimming pool not to have a matching outdoor shower. The Western restaurant is good. The manager Sunshine and the waiter Xiao Han are very nice and provide good service. The Chinese restaurant feels like it has no special features and is useless. The villa housekeeper Norah's service was very good and she responded in a timely manner and helped with late check-out. Thank you very much! It‚Äôs really a comfortable stay in the hotel. I will come back next time~ By the way, the free travel photography is also good, the photographer is very good! The gym equipment is a bit sp**** but it's okay for training.

In addition, the fish in the water can also be fed for free, which adds to the fun.
Cleanliness: Very clean, room service is provided twice a day, and all supplies will be replenished as long as they are used.
Service: Yarra's service is very professional, giving a lot of considerate suggestions and actively responding to needs. Luggage is delivered to the room by a dedicated person, and the tidying service is the best I have ever experienced in any star-rated hotel.

About service
Hotel service: Staff in all areas are very welcoming to guests, giving people a warm and cordial feeling like going home.
Public area
The design of the hotel's public area is quite rich, with four swimming pools, four restaurants, and a dedicated children's playground and swimming pool, making it very relaxing to soak in the hotel.
Artificial ocean water sports: You can take your children to the pier to feed the small fish, or let them experience kayaking/paddleboarding and other activities to make up for the fact that the beach bay cannot go into the sea.

‚ù∂The overall service awareness is still very good. A housekeeper will contact you one day in advance.

The corresponding roof is the starry sky bar and the rooftop swimming pool, which is very convenient. In addition to the room type upgrade, the supporting value-added services have also been upgraded, including bubble bath, fruit welcome gift, coconut water, minibar...all value-added services other than paid items are bonus points.

‚ù∑The decoration style of the hotel room is what netizens call the full monsoon style. Relatively speaking, it is still OK to take photos and check in, but it is less precipitous.

‚ù∏The location is still very good. It only introduces seawater to form an inland sea. Parent-child entertainment is okay, but it is not of much use to me.

It was said that the hotel is suitable for couples to take photos and so on, and I was not disappointed. Helen the housekeeper arranged for us a prime location on the 11th floor, with welcome fruits, etc. We went a little early, so we didn‚Äôt ask for the romantic decoration of the room for the time being. Helen, the housekeeper, also provided excellent service. She was sick and had a ho**** voice, and she introduced us along the way. The hotel breakfast is also quite rich. There is a bamboo forest in the lobby where you can check in and take photos, a starry sky bar, and an infinity pool. There are few people at the beach. You can swipe your room card to enter.

msg:I had read a lot of negative reviews online and was hesitant, but finally decided on the Addison, and it turned out that I made the right choice. The staff greeted us warmly from the moment we got off the bus. They opened the door and picked up our luggage (the same goes for every time we come back from a trip). Our luggage was delivered directly to the room. We arrived at the hotel at around 12 noon and checked in directly without waiting. The butler Runki helped us. We were upgraded to a room on the 11th floor with a great view. We were personally taken to the room. Because we were bringing a baby, we also prepared a crib, bed surround, bottle sterilizer and bathtub (although it is not primarily for parent-child use, there are many items for babies. Provided, even diapers) The room is bright and clean, with a simple style that I like. The next day Runki was very considerate and asked us how we were resting and if we needed to change pillows (I chose a latex pillow). The room service was also very good. They turned down the bed every day. The most "outrageous" thing was to put us on the table. The objects were all lined up and placed, which really shocked me hahahaha. During the stay, the staff were very warm and kind. They gave me a gift bag for the baby. They greeted the baby warmly every time they saw me. It felt very good. If you need anything, you can directly ask the housekeeper or call the front desk, which is very efficient. The breakfast in the restaurant is pretty good, and some of the dishes are changed every day. In addition to breakfast, we also ordered room delivery service, dinner hot pot buffet at Jin Restaurant, and Western food at Tianlu. The services were all online and tasted good. They also helped me make extra baby food. Eat meals. If I go to Sanya again in the future, I will definitely stay at the EDITION!

The fragrance used in the hotel is Lelabo, which is high-end and comfortable. When I checked in, I learned that I was on my honeymoon, and they took the initiative to upgrade my room type and arrange the room for me. The kind-hearted Karina (emphasis on praise) helped us apply for countless little surprises, such as red wine, refreshing refreshments, beach bags... The rooms and public areas perfectly combine minimalism and sophistication, and the sensor door is very ingenious. The three days and two nights I spent at the Edition allowed me to relax and enjoy myself. Whether it was the front desk, the room cleaning lady, the shuttle bus boy, or the security guard at the door, they were all smiling, which put me in a good mood every day. . Super recommended! ! !

Before check-in, we were reminded about the weather conditions in Sanya and that we can make reservations for hotel restaurants in advance. We also paid attention to our car usage and restaurant reservations every day after check-in. Because we were bringing a baby, we also prepared a complete set of daily necessities for the baby, etc., and took care of the details. Very good.

As soon as I entered the main entrance, I was deeply attracted by the overall style. It is a simple and luxurious style that I like. The internet celebrities checking in and taking photos of silhouettes in the lobby are particularly interesting, so I took a lot of photos here. In addition, the hotel also has Dior's Secret Realm, a private beach, a starry sky bar, and a pool party in the middle, all of which are very photogenic places. There is really no problem in spending two days in this hotel.

In addition, the most noteworthy thing is EDISON's service. It‚Äôs just like what I saw when I did the guide before, and it‚Äôs even better than I imagined. The service manager Irene was very helpful throughout the whole process and tried her best to help me with any needs I had. They helped me arrange my favorite bubble bath for two nights, and also arranged rooms with different views for two days at my request to make my stay more enjoyable. The hotel also arranged welcome fruits and check-in gifts. The dedication of all Edison employees can be seen in every detail. All the employees we met on the road smiled and greeted us.

The breakfast and dinner buffets are also great! ! I recommend everyone to come and stay here. You will definitely feel that your trip is worthwhileü•∞ü•∞

Service: The staff in each position are friendly, professional, efficient and have a strong sense of proportion. All the services are just right and make you feel very comfortable. Irene gave us many surprises. We never expected that an old couple could be romantic and full of happiness. I really like the waitress's overalls, tight shorts with a sleeveless white shirt and a small black cross-body bag. Capable and handsome. When the doorman sees guests coming in and out to pick up their luggage, they always run over to pick them up.
Guest room: The decoration and furniture are simple and practical, the air conditioner has no noise, the bedding is clean and comfortable, and the shower room door does not overflow.
Meals: I experienced the breakfast buffet and the seafood buffet in the evening at Jin Restaurant. They were both very good. The dishes were rich and the taste was light, not salty and not greasy, which suited my appetite. The only thing is that the coffee is a little tasteless and not very smooth.
Entertainment: We all experienced water sports such as kayaking and bicycles. The sea breeze was very pleasant. Children can feed the fish, and the water quality is good and clean. I saw three swimming pools, and the infinity pool on the roof was a bit small. There are good salt water and fresh water swimming pools by the sea. After dinner, it was nice to walk along the beach, the sand is quite fine.
Very nice hotel, will come again next time.

msg:Let‚Äôs talk about the advantages first:
This is a unique and poetic hotel. The sea breeze, fine sand, blue sea, and sunny weather give this international boutique hotel its own unique charm in the South China Sea.
As soon as you enter the lobby, you can see the silhouette of the bamboo forest. You don't need to have superb photography skills, even with the most ordinary mobile phone, you can easily capture the charm of the poem. Every frame is art. Just like Zhang Yimou's "Shadow", people are in paintings and people are in poems.
Walking slowly on the steps next to the water, smelling the elegant fragrance in the hall mixed with the smell of the sea breeze, you unconsciously relieve yourself of the fatigue of the journey and block out the hustle and bustle of the city. At this moment, it seems that the world is full of trivial matters that have nothing to do with me.
The butler guides you very thoughtfully, like an old friend, speaking softly, asking about your preferences, your arrangements, and planning your plans. Accompany you to your home, introduce the equipment in the room in detail, arrange your accommodation, and make up for your omissions. Very caring, warm and professional. And this kind of profession is full of warmth, not excessive and out-of-bounds flattery, but like the warm winter sun in the North, warm and beautiful, elegant and calm.
When you stroll through the hotel area, every staff member will respond with a friendly smile and warm greetings wherever you pass. It's like the greetings the neighbors used to make when they went out when they were young. When you have questions, everyone will enthusiastically answer them and actively respond to solve them. It seems that here, you can fully enjoy the slow life, enjoy the quiet time, and spend your energy freely. Everything else was taken care of by them. One small thing can give a glimpse of this. When I came, I didn‚Äôt bring my beach slippers. After a phone call, I was given two children, a boy and a girl, and four pairs of flip-flops. Their flip-flops were packaged as a whole and were soft and non-abrasive. I could use them to catch the sea while spanking the children. ****, just right! High quality item! It's a pity that I won't be allowed to take it away, otherwise I will have to show it off in the circle of friends.
Like flip-flops, the store provides brand-name, high-quality products with a high level of comfort. Their beds and bathrobes are simply top quality, and their mattresses and bedding are soft and comfortable. Bathrobe, skin-friendly and delicate. After taking a shower, you wrap yourself in a bathrobe and lie down on the bed. You will really feel a sigh from the depths of your soul - comfort... and the head of the bed faces the sea. In the early morning, you can stretch out lazily in bed, hug your lover, and see the rising sun gushing out from the sea level through the floor-to-ceiling windows. At night, you can play with your children in bed, and then enjoy the beautiful fireworks shooting out from the beach. Late at night, you can lie on the railing of the balcony, have a drink and meditate, looking down at the artificial sea in the store. The still water flows deep and is silent. Rows of candlelight and lamp strips seem to outline the fairy tale borders on the deep paths. Time stands still at this moment, and this moment is the unique tranquility in your heart.

Let‚Äôs talk about shortcomings
Because there is a bay, the washing area and resting area are in the same area. There are also two sinks thoughtfully installed to avoid the whole family having to wait to wash up at the same time. But the water is very slow, and if you take a little longer to wash your face, there will be water in the pool. You must wash up as early as possible at night because there will be an unpleasant odor. A high-end luxury hotel, with this kind of situation and smell, immediately turned into the smell of a room with no lighting in a somewhat inferior express hotel.
There were burnt marks on the outer interface of one of the power sockets. Although they were small, they were shocking. Is it a leakage? Is the previous guest safe? Will it be safe if we use it? But this time, nothing happened to me. But what about the next guest?
One of the elevators I often take has one of the handrails partially peeled off, and the nails inside are exposed. The originally round and damage-proof corner guards have also become angular, with a small amount of rust taking the opportunity to come out and show off their beauty. Muscles and lines. The entire armrest is shaky and tilted at 30¬∞, as if to declare to the outside world that if anyone touches me again, I will fall. Generally, those who use handrails are the elderly, weak, sick and pregnant. If they scratch or fall while holding handrails, they may not only be in pain.
When leaving the store, ask the waitress at the front desk for an invoice for the food and beverages consumed in the store. The waitress smiled professionally and without warmth, and said that the hotel has regulations that only provide invoices to units and companies, and refuses to provide invoices to individuals. In other words, this is a place where organizations are allowed to corrupt and individuals are not allowed to enjoy themselves. All the good moods I had cultivated in the past few days suddenly disappeared. It was as if I had eaten a fine meal, and the last dessert was half a fly. Very good, let me get back to work immediately. Calm, sober, angry. After all, this is not my own home, I am the one who has taken it too far. However, according to the "Invoice Management Measures of the People's Republic of China" and other laws and regulations, sellers selling or providing taxable services should issue invoices, and buyers should request invoices. Merchants have no right to refuse consumers' request for invoices. At the same time, according to the "Consumer Rights Protection Law of the People's Republic of China" and other relevant laws and regulations, a merchant's refusal to issue an invoice is essentially a form of fraud, and consumers can report the merchant to the industrial and commercial department or industry association. Although it is a foreign brand and an international boutique hotel, after all, it is opened in China and it should abide by Chinese laws. And when service personnel are still Chinese citizens, they should not understand such simple tax laws. At this moment, I finally realized the feeling of being bullied by the store. When I suppressed my anger and asked why the invoice was not provided to the individual, the waitress seemed to hear my dissatisfaction and said, I will ask. Then he just left. When he came back after a while, he didn't seem to even raise his eyelids, and without any explanation or apology, he asked directly, "Do you want to write your own name?" Very good, the service is not professional, the tax laws are not professional, and the politeness is not professional. What is more offensive than unprofessionalism is the lack of service awareness and brand maintenance. Are you an intern? Is he a temporary employee? Is he a relative of the boss? So awesome!
Therefore, when you ask a guest why he is satisfied with everything and insists on giving one star in the end, it is best to ask the last person who received the hotel. And, there really isn‚Äôt half a star.

msg:We first lived in Atlantis for three days, and then moved to the Edition for two days. The reason why we moved once was based on the beauty of living in the Edition in 2019, but this time the experience was a little different. First of all, the butlers are very different. The butlers at Atlantis are impeccable and considerate. They cover all aspects of dining, entertainment, and parking. On the contrary, at Addison, when it comes to the rooftop swimming pool, you need to change the elevator. It is a long walk. The bar, etc., Akira seems to be telling me not to go, so I won‚Äôt go. I really don‚Äôt know what has happened to this hotel in the past few years? Secondly, breakfast ends at 10:00. As a resort hotel, it is really painful to queue up at the door at 9:45. I finally got to the table and was led to the table. I found that the guests at the previous table had not cleared away. I stood there and waited, and it was almost cleared, but they told me that the table was already occupied, and I had to change to another table. The table was still not cleared, so I continued to wait, and I stood there with my child for 20 minutes and couldn't sit down! I didn‚Äôt know what to say, so I suppressed my anger. If I hadn‚Äôt brought my child with me, I would have turned around and left! There are no charging stations in the hotel. There are only a few dedicated to BMW, which are ground-locked. There are different levels of charging! I asked the doorman and was told that there was a charging station in the parking lot opposite. I thought it was close anyway, but I went to charge it when I still had about 30 kilometers of battery life. I found that all the charging piles were broken. After a cold sweat, I ran back to Atlanta. Theiss recharged, the same Atlantis GRO took care of everything for me, lived in the Addison, ate at Atlantis, and watched two wonderful fireworks at Atlantis, this is our Real feelings. In addition, Addison's bath soap has been replaced by a large bottle, and the shelf life and hygiene level cannot be guaranteed. The four small bottles and one bag are no longer available, and the mineral water has also been changed to Jingtian 330ml as standard in express hotels. This The room rate is almost 6,000 per night, no one can compare to this! It‚Äôs still the same bubble pool, the same big bucket, and the same children‚Äôs paradise. Nothing has changed except that it‚Äôs old. In Addison, except for more little internet celebrities who take selfie sticks wherever they go without any scruples, there is nothing now!

On the day of check-in, he coordinated and arranged a room that could be cleaned as quickly as possible, and equipped a garment steamer according to my needs (so that I can wear flat and neat clothes every day~)
Because we were staying for a long time, Yarra also sent us a whole box of bottled water... very considerate! This double festival showed the hotel's thoughtfulness. Not only did they prepare a fireworks show, but they also gave away red wine and snacks... Time flies so fast. I will come back if I have the chance!
Ps: During our stay, the lady who cleaned the room also washed our socks... I planned to come back at night to wash them, but I'm very sorry. Thank you!

msg:When I got off the taxi, three front desks greeted me warmly. One guided me out of the car, one took my luggage, and one took me to the lobby. It was in sharp contrast to my previous hotel. The previous hotel was also an old hotel. The C-level hotel in Yalong Bay had a bit old facilities. The service was mediocre and I waited until 4pm to check in. It was my first time to stay in this hotel. I wanted to give it a try. It was much better than expected. Check-in was very fast. Special staff guided me. Specialist Karina provided one-on-one service. She dealt with all kinds of problems throughout the process. She was warm and thoughtful. The cleaners were also very enthusiastic. Baby milk, turndown was done carefully. Since we had children, Karina coordinated with someone to put together beds for us. The bed in the standard room was a rare one. It was the most comfortable two nights I slept during the trip. There are unexpected small gifts every day, including red wine, fruit, turtle bread, and free drinks and snacks in the mini bar. The quality of the breakfast in the restaurant is the best five-star I have ever tried. The dishes in their Western restaurant Egret are exquisite, authentic and beautiful. This is a hotel I will visit twice. There is no need to introduce the environment, just look at the pictures for yourself. That‚Äôs it next time. Thanks to Karina from the guest relations depar**ent for her considerate service. Any problems she had during the stay were quickly resolved. I will choose her again next time.

Irene called me in advance to confirm what I needed and delivered it when I checked in. Baby supplies, when you enter the room, you will see the bed surround and small tent that have been arranged. We also gave away a little turtle pineapple bun, which was refreshing and refreshing, as well as a flower petal bubble bath. He also sends thoughtful WeChat messages every day to remind me of various matters. Not to mention the hotel facilities, the area for activities is very large, the children's playground is also loved by babies, the seawater swimming pool and the infinity pool on the 12th floor are both checked in, and there are bubble parties in the family pool every day. We also had barbecue at the beach restaurant, which was very delicious. The breakfast variety is also very rich and the service is attentive and attentive.

msg:1. Hardware: 1. The hotel as a whole is very beautiful, but the room decoration is too simple and does not look like a high-end luxury hotel. 2. There is a big problem with the management of the children's playground. Children with fever were allowed to play in the public children's playground even with cooling patches on their heads. My baby was infected with the hand, foot and mouth virus and spent the rest of his trip in the children's hospital. 3. The mat on the bottom of the saltwater swimming pool is really disgusting.
2. Software: 1. The breakfast is rich and has many categories. 2. The female employee who is responsible for registration at the entrance of the breakfast restaurant asks diners for their room number with a straight face every day like interrogating prisoners. The experience is very bad. On the contrary, Yanlord Crown, the first hotel we stayed at during this trip, was a plus in this aspect. Four young and lovely girls greeted us enthusiastically and said good morning, which was really cordial. 3. The hotel arranged a fireworks show during the National Day, which was better. 4. The butler Ashely‚Äôs service was very warm and thoughtful. It was the only good service experience I had at the EDITION hotel during this trip.

msg:This is my first time staying in the Edison, how should I put it, it's mixed. Let‚Äôs talk about the good things first: the hotel attaches great importance to privacy. To enter the hotel gate, you need to check the reservation information. To get to the beach, you need to swipe your room card to get in and out. The two rows of bamboo forests in the lobby are holy places for online celebrities to check in. Many people take pictures here every day, and the effect of the photos is very artistic. The overall style of the hotel is magnificent, full of modernity, simple but not simple. The room design is also minimalist. This time we booked two rooms, and the hotel gave them upgrades, including a Fengshang Studio and a Tinghai Suite. The fashion room is the one that is very popular on the Internet, with round veils, a large round bathtub, and a huge square bathtub on the open balcony. I feel that I will not get tired of staying in the room all day. The Tinghai Suite is very large, more than 100 square meters, with a large balcony, which can be used for meetings. There are many doors, and it feels like you will get lost in the room. Both rooms can see the sea, neither of which is directly facing. Let me talk about the garden design of the hotel. There is a seawater pool in the hotel. It is said that there are marine life in it, and some people kayak on it. There are many trees, lush and green, with winding paths leading to secluded places, and sofa chairs appear from time to time by the water. Sitting on the sofa with the cool breeze blowing on your face, it is easy to sink. The hotel has 7 swimming pools, except for one seawater swimming pool that can be opened until 10 pm, and the others are closed at 8 pm. The infinity swimming pool on the 12th floor has a beautiful view and overlooks the entire Edison. The water temperature is not constant, but there is a smaller jacuzzi next to it, and the water temperature is more suitable. The overall feeling of the hotel is that there are not many people. Although the occupancy rate is high and basically full, I don‚Äôt feel that there are so many people. This is very satisfying to me‚Äî‚ÄîI just came from such a noisy environment in Atlantis When I came out, I really needed such a quiet a**osphere, this is the feeling of vacation. Then let's talk about the bad aspects: 1. First of all, the service aspect. I heard that the Edition is the hotel with the best service in Haitang Bay, but my experience is very bad. It was very unpleasant to check in first. The hotel told us that you can check in at 4 o'clock. If there are vacancies, you can go earlier. I arrived after 2 o'clock. There is no vacancy and I have to wait. I am mentally prepared. It is normal for hotels to have no vacancies in this summer peak season. , I just said that I hope it can be done as soon as possible. I also had a companion who arrived 20 minutes later than me. When they arrived, they said there was a vacant room and checked in directly. I said we booked the same room type, so why didn't I have a vacant room? The hotel said that the room that was upgraded for me has not been cleaned yet, well, I will continue to wait. But after 4 o'clock, when I asked the housekeeper again, the housekeeper said that the cleaning had not been finished yet. I had already waited for more than 2 hours at this time, and it had passed the check-in time stipulated by Edison. I contacted the front desk and The housekeeper contacted me many times and asked me to continue to wait. I couldn't bear it so I contacted Ctrip. Here I am really grateful to Ctrip. After hearing about this situation, Ctrip immediately contacted Edison and asked to check in me immediately, and said 15 If I can't check in in a few minutes, Ctrip will help me coordinate and solve it again until it is solved. Ctrip is really useful. The front desk immediately contacted me and said that I can check in... 15 minutes later, Ctrip called me again to confirm whether I have checked in. I said yes, and I thanked Ctrip very much and solved the problem for them Very satisfied with the speed. This stay made me very disappointed with the Edison. Neither the housekeeper nor the front desk could solve any problems. If Ctrip didn't intervene, I really don't know how long I would have to wait. 2. Butler. The housekeeper who contacted me didn't know whether it was the lack of training of the new staff or the bad mood. It gave me the feeling that he didn't like to talk to people. I sent messages and inquiries and never responded in time. Later, I couldn't bear it and contacted Edison to ask for a new housekeeper. No I was really speechless when I thought that the customer service just promised and didn't change it for me at all. But objectively speaking, the housekeeper of our traveler is very good, with caring service and timely response. Maybe it's my bad luck that I didn't meet a good housekeeper. 3. Response speed. Very slow, very untimely. I called the front desk to ask for a pair of disposable slippers and bathrobes. There was no movement for half an hour. I called again to urge them, and it took another 20 minutes before they were delivered. This response speed is really the first time I have seen it! These three items are actually service aspects. It can be said that Edison's service left a very bad impression on me. The last thing I can't stand is that the temperature of the refrigerator is set at 15¬∞. For me who must drink iced drinks in summer, it can be said to be very unfriendly. It is the first time I saw a hotel refrigerator with this temperature. This is not a refrigerator. Originally, I was very satisfied with the design and privacy experience of the Edison. I thought about staying in Sanya for a few more days next time, but I really can't accept the service and the temperature of the refrigerator. I hope the hotel can improve it. In short, the hardware of the hotel is good, and the software support such as services needs to be improved.

Our family of three spent 3 days They all stay and play in the hotel, the children like it very muchüëçBreakfast and dinner are delicious in our house. It is inevitable that there are too many people, but the service is in place and there is no sense of crowding at all, but there are always fly in the oin**ent. Two points: first, the beach outside the hotel It‚Äôs really not as good as the Wanning Le M√©ridien Hotel. It may be because of public management. The children‚Äôs sand-digging toys are also messy. You can sort it out, or prepare a separate set for each child. After all, such a high-end hotel Children's needs should be taken into consideration; Second, the hotel's food is very delicious, but the price is a bit expensive! So you can eat like our family, eat at the hotel and eat at the takeaway. Generally speaking, I am not disappointed. As the last stop of my trip to Hainan, I am very satisfied~ Especially the smell of the hotel, I love it so much Considerate serviceüòäüòäSee you next timeüëã

The hotel has a high photo production rate, and you can take beautiful photos during the day and night. My suggestion is to add the butler's WeChat message to ask where breakfast is. The reply came after an hour and it was already finished. A message was sent at 10:45 in the evening. Wouldn‚Äôt those who went to bed early be woken up? If you can't reply to messages in time, there is no need to add WeChat. Other hotels with the same price offer better services

The butler Bruce contacted me several days in advance and made arrangements for the restaurants that I needed to make reservations for later. Because we have many children, we also thoughtfully prepared the children's supplies. Because we went early that day, Bruce took us around the hotel and introduced each area in detail before we could get in the room. Children like the artificial beach and artificial sea the most, and they really played all day long! During the few days I lived in Edison, I really felt at home. Basically, every staff member I met would greet you with a smile. Next time, the first choice in Sanya must be Edison.

msg:The most satisfactory hotel in this trip to Sanya
Thanks to the front desk for upgrading the fashion sea view room for us, with a bubble pool facing the beautiful view of the sea.
The room is minimalist, and any shot is a blockbuster.
The toiletries are lelabo! The scent is very healing
Thank you ‚ú®Hotel Karina ‚ú® for your thoughtful and meticulous service
Help us arrange fruit and bubble bath reservations
Don't forget to give us a small gift when you check out
Thank you very much for working hard for us
The hotel breakfast is great! Healthy freshly squeezed juices are my favorite! There is also a poolside afternoon tea on the 12th floor! The beach barbecue at night tastes good too
The hotel's service attitude is very good. The service staff who see off the guests and take the luggage are also very good. The younger sisters and younger brothers are also very patient with children.

The area in the hotel is spacious, the design is simple, the crowd does not gather, there is no need to rush, and there are many activities. You are free to choose. Wherever you go, everyone has a smile on their faces. It heals the impatience in the heart and drives away the daily troubles. The point is that the daughter is very happy ü•≥ gave her the first intimate contact with the sea and an extraordinary vacation experience! I took a lot of beautiful photos. Special thanks to Evelyn who received us. She is very warm and gentle. I will always be with my friends in Amway Edison!

She even prepared a gift for us when we left the store. The child is in the room. The on-duty manager and room service came several times. The breakfast was very rich and the children ate before I had time to take pictures. The barbecue restaurant and Jin restaurant are recommended. The Indonesian restaurant can listen to songs while eating and tasting wine! If you come to Sanya in the future, you must live in the Edition! ! !

The butler Luna took the initiative to upgrade me to a sea view room. I saw the super authentic view of the hotel and the sea, so I checked in During the period, I took the initiative to ask many times if there was any need for other services. The reply efficiency was very high, and I felt very comfortable.
There are so many scenes that can be punched in the hotel, and it is special to shoot casually.
In the past few days, we have taken a taxi every day. No matter what time of day, the waiter at the entrance of the lobby will open and close the car door for us in time and greet us. Sometimes I just stand, and there will be waiters who will take the initiative to ask if I need help.
The service of Edison can really be called the ceiling of Sanya Hotel.

Crown is more suitable for young children, while Addison is more suitable for elementary school students. Atlantis's price includes a water park and aquarium, so it has an advantage in terms of children's entertainment. The EDITION Hotel is great for taking photos and has a unique design. The staff at EDITION have a strong sense of service, the bedding is very comfortable, and the cleanliness is worthy of praise. Breakfast is also good, Western style tastes better than Chinese style. Haitang Bay is more suitable for hotels, and the Edition is pretty good.

Their one-to-one butler service was really considerate. My butler lady named Wendy was very considerate on the first day I checked in. After adding me on WeChat, I basically contact her at any time when the plane lands and when I check in; for reservations for afternoon tea, beach barbecue, and some hotel entertainment facilities, I basically contact Wendy the housekeeper. I even casually said that I like this. The housekeeper gave me a set of brand-name cleaning products. In addition, all the employees in the hotel basically provide service with a smile and feel very friendly. During our visit, we ordered their afternoon tea. I personally liked it. The taste was moderately salty and sweet. The pastry chef Qianqian asked us about our evaluation of the desserts after our meal, and she understood the taste of each customer and made further improvements. Really striving for perfection; Miss Ella, the waitress at Starry Sky Afternoon Tea, is enthusiastic and cute. She not only provides good service but also patiently helps with taking photos. She made a new drink for a drink that was a bit sour, which was quite considerate.

Everyone is enthusiastic and makes people feel happy without any feeling of being overwhelmed. The breakfast at the hotel was very good and the toppings on the noodles were delicious. The desserts at dinner were also great. I went to the Star Bar for a few drinks in the evening. There were some hiccups, but the waiter handled it very well and made my friends and I have a pleasant night. Special mention goes to my housekeeper Sia. We have been following us since we checked in and upgraded to the most popular stylish suite. While waiting for cleaning, I walked around the park with us to introduce the infrastructure. Any problems during the stay were handled and resolved in a timely manner, allowing my family and I to have a wonderful vacation experience.

I feel that the hotel's facilities are not too old and are well maintained. I checked the towels and supplies, and they all appear to be quite new, within the past few months. right! The hair dryer I highly praise is Dyson. I went to Capella before coming to EDITION. The Capella hair dryer is really not that difficult to use even though it costs 30 yuan... ü•≤
Although there are slightly more people in the Edition, I think the experience and service are much better than those at Capella.

In other hotels I stayed at during this trip, I felt the gap in actual experience was more or less lacking in the well-known service on the Internet. There were not many compliments on this aspect on the EDITION website, but it really left a deep impression. Will proactively ask about room needs and proactively propose some customized methods to guide guests to have a more comfortable stay experience. The butler Runki is really a very considerate butler. I heard that it was a honeymoon and gave special arrangements and complimentary drinks. He also provided free drinks every day. There are careful reminders in the morning and evening, and the response speed is really seconds, which is much faster than contacting the front desk by phone (this is the high standard of butler service, not the kind of hotel that does not reply for an hour...).
Amway's several hotel projects
1. The seawater swimming pool is great, it will be more buoyant than ordinary swimming pools, satisfying your fun in Haitang Bay where you can‚Äôt go into the sea
2. The boats on the artificial lake can be rowed, and the a**osphere is very good
3. Beach barbecue must be booked in advance to eat! ! I thought it was more of an Internet celebrity nature, the one with a simple environment. Unexpectedly, the level of the chef I MADE is really better than the praise on the Internet. Fresh ingredients and just the right barbecue are really the best food answer.

After checking in, the service response was very fast, and basically everything was answered. The service experience was still very considerate, which should be the biggest highlight.
The entire hotel has a sense of design, and many of the design details are interesting and suitable for young people. The hotel has a lot of check-in points, and there are many places to take photos. However, the room decoration is a bit frigid, and the room equipment is also very poor, especially the toilet does not come with a smart toilet seat. As a result, the experience after staying here is average, which is worse than other hotels in the same price range.
The toiletries are from Le Labo, which is standard for hotels in this price range of Haitang Bay. The smell is 33, which is too strong and does not go with the frigid style.
Then the coconut that was delivered was not sweet. I thought it was a problem with the hotel at first, but later I found out that this is the case with Hainan coconuts in this season. I suggest sending coconut jelly in the future.
Finally, I would like to thank Runki for its enthusiastic service and quick response to any problems encountered. I may not use it again, but I think overall it was a very satisfying travel experience.

I couldn't help but try the Edition in May this year. I regretted coming late and regretting that my stay was too short. Simple luxury meets the aesthetic, and a saltwater pool is unparalleled. Because of a misunderstanding, I met Brady, the manager on duty, and opened a new door at EDITION. I decided to come back and enjoy it again after 100 days. Brady's attentive service, upgraded room type, moderate condolences without intrusion, late check-out... Like üëç
Xianhai Restaurant is completely unconventional. Basically, everything you order tastes good and the price is not expensive.

msg:Feeling that Edison's service is really great! Thanks to the butler Winnie for her meticulous care and arrangements!

As soon as you enter the hotel, you will feel like a vacation. The music, fragrance, and vegetation are all super relaxing!

The best thing about Edison is that it feels like you are in a giant art space. Every corner has its own unique aesthetic feeling. There are many installations in the hotel, as well as buyer shops, art exhibitions, and galleries. You are not afraid of no activities at all.

There are also many activities to play in the hotel's artificial sea. Kayaks, paddle boards, and water bikes are all free. Starry Sky Bar and Beach Bar are also very comfortable. The cocktails in the Starry Sky Bar are all very characteristic of Hainan‚Äôs local customs. It‚Äôs wonderful to use guava and lotus mist to mix drinks!

It is true that the hotel room has been used for some years, but it is still quite textured. Some people say it looks like a high-end full season, but it can also be understood as a wabi-sabi style haha.

In addition, I would like to give a special compliment to the hotel's breakfast. The drinks alone are much better than other hotels. There are all kinds of freshly squeezed juices, milkshakes made with fresh fruits, and yogurt made with fresh fruits, which are super rich! There are local snacks such as hoon noodles and yellow rice cakes, and the baking is also good.

The only regret is that the originally scheduled beach barbecue restaurant was too hot to sit for a second longer. It was unexpectedly good to eat buffet seafood hot pot indoors. You can eat all kinds of fresh seafood, but there is no lobster in the buffet of more than 400 yuan. It's a pity to eat such hard dishes, but overall it's quite comfortable to eat!

Overall, it is a very suitable choice for young people!

I have been coming to Haitang Bay for four consecutive years and the service at Addison is definitely the worst. The external environment is really good, but the internal environment is really bad. So many good reviews on social software must be paid to find people to post them, right? I will never come again, the experience was extremely bad! !

msg:Great experience, staying in the Edition for the first time, I can't help but say that the hotel is great, whether it's breakfast or facilities, it's all in place, not to mention the service, all the details are also in place, Welcome fruit was given when I checked in. There is a capsule coffee machine in the room. The waiter saw that I was using the hotel handbag to pack things, and the bag strap was broken. He also specially sent me the hotel canvas bag and coconut to drink. Every day downstairs The shuttle bus can be used to go to the swimming pool and the beach. The hot pot buffet in the hotel‚Äôs Jin Restaurant is also delicious. The waiter saw that it was inconvenient for me to bring the children to pick up the meal, so he took the initiative to help me pick up the meal, and even ran over to ask me if I wanted to try it. Taste the coconut, the room is very comfortable with automatic curtains, Dyson‚Äôs hair dryer, and children in the children‚Äôs paradise also like it very much. In short, all the details made my experience great and left good memories for my trip to Sanya. Thank you, next time Will choose here again, look forward to seeing you again!

msg:After a 4-year absence due to the epidemic, I embarked on a trip to Sanya, Hainan again in the summer vacation... I went to the resort hotel in Clear Water Bay first (I didn‚Äôt expect it to become an Internet celebrity because of a movie when I booked it, it‚Äôs because I have too much vision Okay?) Then because I missed everything about Edison, I set the second half here again. The beauty of meeting Edison for the first time seems to be still vivid in my memory. In a blink of an eye, the little baby who was digging sand in Haitang Bay has grown Aunt Dacheng is cold. When I stepped into the Edition Hotel again, I felt like I was going home. Nothing has changed, but there are many new things. The facilities are more perfect, and the little crab actually has a home Road, the pink beach leisure area is really comfortable. If I can, I would like to lie down for a day without driving... It would be even better if the drink service can be added. I feel that I lack the regret of holding a coconut in my hand and listening to the sea lapping the shore. Everyone knows that the service volume of high-end hotels in Sanya and even the entire Haitang Bay is really not an exaggeration. The birthday surprise arrangement on the first day was already amazing. On the second day, because we drank a lot of water, we brought a whole box of water back. I couldn't help laughing when I saw it in the room. On the third day, I saw my husband and daughter's socks on the sneakers helped wash and dry them in the sun on the balcony... This is really embarrassing. The room service is also an unforgettable part. The wonderful meals make the holiday full of happiness, and the impact of dopamine flows from the stomach to the heart. This time I also tried the hotel‚Äôs laundry service, because I went to Boundary Island the day before check-in and it was so hot that the clothes got wet a few times and I couldn‚Äôt bear it. When the washed clothes were sent back, they were really clean and fragrant, and they were ironed. Folding is almost the same as when it was for sale in the store... The four words of being at home may be the best and most true evaluation of Edison's service, and I would also like to call it the ceiling-level existence of Sanya's hotel industry. My little housekeeper is a beautiful Yunnan mushroom cool. I learned that I really like the smell of its unique black tea aroma. I always believe that memories are also delicious. Every time I pass by the rest area with a few meters high automatic wooden door next to the lobby Sometimes I always have to inhale the strong and refreshing aroma into my nasal cavity. The night before I checked out, I hung the two sets of aromatherapy sets as souvenirs on the door of the room, which is not too disturbing and has a sense of boundaries but is always present. The absence of service and care is just right and the most touching. The love for Edison may be due to the surprise of love at first sight a few years ago, or the wonderful experience of its real existence. As long as I mention the sunny beach in Sanya, I will only think of everything here.

Environment: Very beautiful, whether it is taking pictures or visuals, it is a kind of enjoyment. It is also very convenient to go to the beach, the sand is very soft, although it is a public beach, there are not many people, the beach is also very clean, no garbage, no fishy smell.
Service: I would like to praise my butler Lili here, she is very caring, always answering every question, replying to messages very quickly, and has been caring when I learned that I am not feeling well. Other staff in the hotel also serve with a smile, and they will take the initiative to say hello when they meet. Calling the customer service center in the room can be connected quickly, and the demand will be sent quickly.
Sunset drinks for two at the beach club for 2 hours: I have to say that the environment here is very good, there are not many people, there are swimming pools, bars, booths, no matter how you take pictures, it is beautiful.
Summer camp: The children liked it very much and had a great time. The adults did not need to accompany them. The lunch was also highly recognized by the children.
If I have a chance, I still want to stay in the Edition again. This hotel is currently the top 3 among the hotels I have stayed in.

1Ô∏è‚É£. Different from other hotels, Edison will have a lady add WeChat to ask if you need room decoration from the day before check-in.
2Ô∏è‚É£ On the day of check-in, before getting out of the car, the staff at the door will greet you warmly, carry the bag, take the luggageüß≥, bring it to the front desk, and send it to the room.

msg:During the trip to Sanya during the summer vacation, I stayed in three hotels before and after. MGM, InterContinental, Edison. Among them, the Edison service is the best.
 From the moment you get off the bus and arrive, there will be someone who will lead you to store your luggage, check you in, and lead you all the way to the room. It will also carefully introduce which ones in the refrigerator in the room are free and which ones need to be paid, which is very considerate.
Moreover, among several hotels, the Edison is the only hotel that contacted us in advance to ask what we need. Although some children's barriers and other supplies were forgotten to be installed on the day of check-in, they were resolved very quickly later.

After checking in for about an hour, the butler will deliver a lot of fruit, beer, and beef ****y. Among them, the beef ****y is made by the hotel and is very delicious.

Except for the meticulous service of butler Runki, the whole hotel pays great attention to service details.
The waiter in the cafeteria will take the initiative to ask if you want drinks such as coffee and tea during breakfast.
The staff in the children's play area will play with the children when they are not busy.
The staff during the children's activities are also very attentive. They don't just go through the process on the surface, but they can feel the staff's intentions.

facility:
The hotel has basic facilities. Although it is an online celebrity check-in shop, it is not inferior to other hotels in terms of parenting children.
In addition to family swimming pools, beach swimming pools, and seawater swimming pools, although not all swimming pools are open until night, they are sufficient for accommodation.

The children's playground is really great! Except for the indoor baby area, which is an air-conditioned room, other non-air-conditioned areas are not stuffy. The overall facilities are relatively new, especially the children's tricycle karting field, which children like very much. The venue staff will also play with the children, very patient!


environment:
The hotel area is very large, especially the water surface area. In addition to several pools, there are waters where kayaking is possible.
The overall atmosphere is more similar to hotels in Thailand, more modern.
There are many places where you can punch in and take pictures.
The hotel has a private beach, but the wind and waves are too big at night, so it is not suitable for children to play on the beach.

advantage:
In Haitang Bay, although the Edition is not famous as a parent-child hotel, the parent-child facilities and parent-child activities are very good.
Of course, the best thing is that there are fewer people in this hotel than other hotels, and there are a lot fewer children. There are not too many people during children's activities, and there are not too many people in the children's playground. The experience of staying in this hotel is very good .
The double bed in the twin room is very large, so it is very comfortable to stay with children.
The buffet breakfast and buffet dinner are very rich. If you don't want to leave the hotel, the buffet is also a good choice.

suggestion:
Although the hotel provides children's products, the used children's products will be taken away when cleaning the next day. It also includes bath towels and toothbrush and toothpaste. We only found out when we washed at night, which would be inconvenient. It is recommended that when the hotel takes away children's products, it should also pay attention to timely replenishment.

In general:
Vindison is more popular with young people, young parents, and foreigners. Design aesthetics are online, staff service and appearance are online. Including tooling, it is biased towards Hong Kong style, and the whole is full of fashion.
Parent-child, couples, are good choices.

I chose a 1.5-meter double bed, which is very spacious for a family of three. Thanks again to Ms. Amy for her nice service. Edison will still be our choice next time when we come to Sanya.

Before coming here, I heard from friends that the service of the hotel is very good. I really appreciate the "frigid" style of hotel. It should be said that I like simple but not simple hotels, so the hotel is in my arms. The hotel's Dragon Boat Festival food is very good. On the day of Dragon Boat Festival, the Cantonese Restaurant of Jin Restaurant also gave me rice dumplings and coconut juice. The breakfast is very rich. Among them, the waitress MARY and the male waiter Xiao Cai are highly praised. The service awareness and attitude are very good, the smile is kind, and there is a kind of homely feeling. The room attendant summer is also very considerate to deliver fruits and drinks. The front desk of the hotel The young lady gave me a free upgrade to a high-floor room with a sea view on the first day of my stay. In short, everything is fine in the Edison. I will choose it next time I come to Sanyaü§ó

I didn‚Äôt even finish shopping in the hotel in two days. The restaurant is also delicious. 24-hour food delivery is absolutely practical for friends with children. When the children are hungry, they will be delivered to the room at any time. The service attitude can be called the ceiling. I feel the infinite enthusiasm from the moment I get off the bus. Whether it is the receptionist or the waiter, they are full of energy and smiles on their faces, especially my housekeeper Runki. I have troubled her with big and small things these two days , The service is warm and thoughtful, which makes me feel very caring! When I come out to play, the first is the scenery, and the second is to enjoy the service of a luxury hotel. The Edition makes me feel that it is worth the money. Thank you, baby Runki, and thank you to all the staff of the Edition. ‚ù§

First of all, I would like to thank Irene for her considerate service throughout the whole process, and also helped us upgrade to a studio suite with a full sea view, which is really cool. The hotel is relatively modern and suitable for taking pictures. My wife checks in, changes clothes, and takes pictures every day. The children's club has a lot of activities, including family swimming pool, sea paddling, etc., and the children are very happy. The food and beverages are also very delicious. The beach restaurant has resident singers and the a**osphere is full. Will stay two more nights next time.

There is a Dior pop-up store and experience space in the hotel, and there are piles of Internet celebrities checking in.

msg:I came to Sanya for the Nth time, read various online reviews, and finally chose the Haitang Bay Edition. It is indeed a hotel that has won a design award. From entering the lobby to the room to the beach, every corner of the hotel is beautiful. There is nothing to say about the soft environment of the hotel. Compared with other hotels in Haitang Bay, the Edition is relatively quieter and easier to relax. In terms of parent-child, the one-day summer camp in the hotel and the parent-child activities provided by the room can definitely make the children happy. Our family is a five-year-old child, and he is well taken care of. The most worth mentioning is Edison's butler service, our personal butler Irene, contacted me the day before we arrived in Sanya, and learned that I was bringing children to stay, and especially prepared children's products, small tents and swimming equipment in the room in advance. During the stay in the hotel, he also actively helped us book hotel projects such as children's summer camps and afternoon tea. Asked every night at the hotel if she could help with some issues the next day. When we checked out, he helped me with my luggage and sent it to the parking lot. The meticulous care and help made our trip more enjoyable! Attached are the wonderful photos of our stay in Edison this time, and we will stay in Edison again next time!

The overall service standard is also average throughout the monsoon, which has nothing to do with a five-star hotel! This is a very poor service concept. From this stay, I feel that the entire All Seasons Hotel, from the staff who answered the phone to the restaurant waiters, has no sense of service, let alone the butler-style service. The breakfast in the restaurant is very poor. Cutting corners and coping with problems, from grassroots employees to management, is very bad! Staff training and standardized work patterns are in shambles. Over the years, apart from the innovative design of Internet celebrities, the service level and breakfast level have declined completely. Very bad experience, very bad feeling!

First of all, the establishment and service content of the guest relations depar**ent makes you feel warm as soon as you enter the store. Irene in the depar**ent provides special services throughout the whole process. During the stay in the store, she constantly cares about our needs and experience. She is enthusiastic, professional and meticulous.
The design and environment of the hotel have a minimalist and high-end feel. The design of the guest rooms is very scientific, focusing on privacy and full of modern elements
The breakfast and buffet in the restaurant provide a rich variety of Chinese and Western food, which are fresh and delicious. The restaurant environment is comfortable and a**ospheric, and it is also simple and high-end
There are Manner coffee and several trendy shops in the hotel, as well as Dior's pop-up shop, where the photos are specially released
There are several areas in the swimming pool area, children's area, adult area and beach club area, which are very reasonable and meet the different needs of different groups
In the evening, drink a glass of your favorite whiskey at the star bar on the 12th floor
Feel the design of the starry sky, chat with professional and talkative bartenders, and feel the unique and wonderful nightlife
The hotel also considerately provides a battery tour bus for free pick-up and drop-off for in-store guests to visit various areas around the swimming pool in the hotel and to the seaside area. The access control card access from the seaside to the hotel also gives hotel guests more sense of security.
As a photographer, this hotel has given me too much desire to take pictures, because there are beautiful scenery everywhere and the details are perfect. I take a lot of photos every day and hope to record more beautiful things.
The above features could not be fully enjoyed in other hotels in Sanya before, so for now, the Edition is the ceiling of Sanya hotels in my mind.
Special thanks again to Irene, the beauty from the guest relations depar**ent; Listen J, the handsome bartender at the Starry Sky Bar; and Alisa, the beauty from the deputy manager of Jin Restaurant
Looking forward to seeing you again and wishing the Edition better and better!

msg:I checked a lot of reviews and booked the Edison, because I don't like noise, so I carefully selected it for a long time, and I am quite satisfied. The breakfast is very rich, and you can eat leisurely for a long time. The front desk will call every day to inquire about the housing experience. The waiter is also very good. I am really embarrassed that he washed my husband's socks by hand. I give this waiter named Zhan Zhongqiang a thumbs up. They gave me a beach bag the next day. They are considerate everywhere, and the hygiene is good. All in all, compared to other hotels, they are quieter and more comfortable. The hotel‚Äôs dinner is also good. The dishes are exquisite and delicious. I like the fish soup with milky cabbage. It's really fresh, friends who like quiet and comfortable can come and try Edison

Needless to say, the hotel environment is low-key and luxurious.
The breakfast is rich in variety, and it takes about three days to eat it all.
The facilities in the room are also very complete, with a frigid style.
The hotel smells good lelabo fragrance everywhere, including my hair hahaha. The butler also gave me a bunch of care products to take away, which is a big deal.

Couples travel is worth experiencing!

Hygiene: The cleaning aunt is very enthusiastic, the cleaning is very clean, and she even braided me a braid, but it is a pity that I did not ask what the name is
Service: The service is very good, especially Karin Xiaokang, who is very enthusiastic. He will explain in detail the distribution of the hotel's facilities and the direction of the specific floor environment. He also gave fruit very thoughtfully. My husband loves the coconut juice here
The only shortcoming can only be said to be the buffet at night. There is really nothing to eat when I go there at 5:30. Compared with the buffet of hotels of the same category, it is slightly worse, whether it is variety or taste.
The breakfast buffet is still remarkable. I don‚Äôt know why the dinner buffet is so different
Overall, this trip is still very satisfying and very happy

I didn‚Äôt expect too much for the hot pot buffet at night when I booked a room with Ctrip, but I didn‚Äôt expect the quality of the ingredients to be far above the standard. Coconut is a must. The whole salmon has a creamy texture that melts in your mouth. The shellfish chicken leg snails in the seafood are fresh and do not take up your stomach. Not much to say, the hotel is highly recommended.

The room style is simple and elegant and very clean. Amy has upgraded us.

Very clean, children's paradise is very suitable for lazy parents

Amy even gave us a gift on the day we left, thank you so much
It's Edison's bath set and accessories
The experience is 100 points. It is a pity that the baby cannot go to the Starry Sky Pool after 5 p.m. and the beach club.
Everything else is perfect. The artificial sea is so beautiful.
There is also a dior theme, very good shot

We booked a three-day and two-night package with a full sea view style suite. The view is truly amazing. The sea view is beautiful no matter day or night, and the hotel also has various design senses.
Before coming here, I heard that the service of Edison is very good, after the experience, it is really great
The day before the check-in, the housekeeper contacted in advance to confirm the itinerary and some needs for the room. Our butler is Iris Xiaogu, who is very caring. She prepared a small gift package for the children, and provided patient answers and services for various needs during the stay. It is especially inconvenient to bring children to the beach club to experience cocktail drinking. With the help of Xiaogu, the club finally sent a few cocktails. Although they are paper cups, it can be seen that they are carefully crafted and decorated, and the small details are full.
In addition, I would like to praise the room service. I ordered a children's meal for the child. The taste is not heavy at all, very healthy, and the details are praised!
Finally, I would like to praise the most important details. Before leaving, the housekeeper Iris Xiaogu prepared a small gift, but the small episode was that the small gift was forgotten. Xiaogu
It is proposed that it can be mailed, which is a capital satisfaction!
I will definitely recommend it to friends who come to Sanya in the future. In short, I had a great time at the hotel during this trip. I have a lot of experience in various projects. I will come back next time I have a chance!

I saw mixed reviews on the Internet before, but this time I felt good about staying hereüëçThe housekeepers of the Edition Hotel contacted me two or three days in advance and told me to introduce the hotel. Ask in advance My flight information, there will be a special car to pick you up at the airport
   When the flight was delayed and arrived at the hotel late that day, the staff directly drove us to the room in a battery car, and registered in the room (this service is really very good). When we meet the staff on the road, they will take the initiative to say helloüôã‚ôÇÔ∏èBasically is responsive
      The whole hotel is relatively popular on the Internet, and the scenery is very good when taking pictures üì∑
       It's a pity that I didn't experience the children's water sports this time (because it is under maintenance) and look forward to the next time

 
      


Finally, I would like to thank the hotel housekeeper Tim for his greetings throughout the whole process and improving the check-in experience. Share hotel travel guides and help book hotel restaurants in timeüç¥

During the check-in period, I will communicate with you in a timely manner and inform you of the hotel's activities in a timely manner.
Service: The hotel staff are very enthusiastic, and they even arranged birthday decorations~ If you encounter a battery car when you are shopping in the hotel, you will stop and ask if you need to take a ride, and someone will give you directions in time wherever you go.
Environment: The overall environment is very comfortable, not too noisy, and the scenery is not bad. The restaurant and beach bar have a good environment.
Facilities: It is still very good, the room layout, toiletries, etc. are all good.
Catering: There are many choices for breakfast, and parents are very satisfied with what they eat. The Tianlu chosen for dinner is also very good. Service during meals was also good.
In short, the overall service of Edison is really good, plus the experience of staying in the environment, I will continue to choose it next time.

Before check-in, the hotel has a special person to add WeChat, and ask the guests what they need. When I checked in, I also upgraded the room type and gave me fruit. It is more convenient to watch the sea hahaha. The decoration style of the room is also my favorite log simple design, the layout is reasonable and practical, and the balcony is really comfortable to wait for the wind in the morning and evening~
There are many varieties of buffet breakfast, and it is difficult to choose if I have a big stomach. There are very few people on the beach at the entrance, the sand is very fine, the water is clear and the sky is blue~
Special praise to Ms. Runki, she can answer all the questions I asked on WeChat quickly and accurately. When I checked in, she introduced me to the room and sent me into the room, and finally gave me le labo Edison ** toiletries~ I will still choose his house next time I come to Haitang Bay!

Taking the cub out to play during the short vacation, I chose the Edition.
From the very beginning of check-in, the lovely little sister Yarra took care of her all the way, with meals, cute cub supplies and play facilities all available.
The little sister helped us upgrade to a stylish double room, where you can see the sea, and the room has a lot of space, and there is a super romantic gauze curtain beside the bed.
The welcome drink when you check in is two big coconuts ü•• and a rich fruit plate. The supplies in the room are Le labo's supplies, which is a super bonus! !
In the evening, adults can go to the drinking spa with super joy, a whole lot of satisfaction ‚ù§Ô∏è

I have to admit that when I first checked in, I was intimidated by the check-in line and all kinds of girls posing for pictures, thinking that I would be wronged for spending money. As a result, after staying for a week, he successfully became a fan! !
As my friends have said, the disadvantages of Edison are obvious, and the advantages are even more obvious. The simple design makes it easy to relax, and the various landscape designs of the films really make people who don't like to take pictures can't help but appreciate it.
The equipment in the room is excellent, coupled with the thoughtful service of the room cleaning sisters, as well as the enthusiastic communication, we truly feel at home!
The little brother who manages the kayak is also very enthusiastic. He prepared fish food for the children who can‚Äôt row the boat to feed the fish, and enthusiastically shared with us the types of kayaks and even the types of fish in the lake. learned a lot
Allen at the beach bar is also great. He recommended good cocktails for us to drink and take pictures. He also helped us take group photos and told us which seats are good for taking pictures! This warm and caring reception is simply touching!
Elaine and Alice at the front desk are also very caring. They help solve all kinds of small troubles one by one. It's really great! Finally, I would like to thank the housekeeper Brandon, because with children, there are various small problems from time to time, and he took the trouble to help meet the requirements.
In short, the experience has gone from negative to 100! Even to the extent that everyone is satisfied with Amway, I will come again in the future if I have the opportunity

The bed is really big, especially suitable for families with children. Every staff member greeted us warmly. In the evening, we went out and came back, and we thoughtfully prepared a bubble bath. The children were very happy. The breakfast was really rich and delicious. Our beautiful butler Irene was very caring and gentle, and took care of the children's emotions. She gave game coins and Sea Turtle Bread carefully introduced the hotel facilities, and our request was quickly resolved. He asked about our check-in experience in a timely manner. When we left, because the flight was delayed, he even applied for a check-out at 3 p.m. and sent a gift for the children Gifts and a bath set, the smell is really good, the experience of staying this time is really good. The downside is that the hotel does not provide pick-up and drop-off services.

This is my second time to stay, because the first time I checked in gave me a great impression, I was still very nervous at the time, I saw bad reviews on the Internet, until the check-in completely dispelled my thoughts, as long as I met in the public area Their staff will greet each other warmly, including the cleaning uncle who cleans the elevator. He will not be very casual, and it can be seen that their service is very standardized. Regardless of off-season or peak season, the price difference of the hotel will not be too big, except for holidays of course. Compared with other hotels, the service will naturally not keep up with the price. I personally experience it, so the service of the Edison is there. The design of the hotel is very simple and elegant, with smooth lines. I like it very much no matter whether it is "full monsoon" or not. The hotel's breakfast is too rich and the quality is guaranteed. The meal package with chocolate and peanut butter is really perfect! Freshly squeezed juices, free choice of varieties, not those boxed drinks, yogurt is also handmade, and the honey taste is very delicious. Reservations are required for the hotel's restaurants, beach barbecue and Xianhai restaurant, I prefer Xianhai restaurant, Wenchang chicken in soy sauce is tender and delicious, mushroom soup is rich in layers, with the deliciousness of mushrooms and the sweetness of jujube, just right, the taste explodes Thumbs up! These two check-ins were all due to Kim's busy schedule. He responded quickly, listened carefully, and helped us upgrade the room. The communication was very heartwarming. Every time, he would think and solve problems from the customer's point of view, and made the service to the extreme. Otherwise, I won‚Äôt be looking for him the second time. Thank you Edison, thank you Kim, the trip to Sanya has come to a perfect conclusion!

Environment: The environment is very good, and there are scenery everywhere. It is worthy of being an Internet celebrity check-in hotel. When I came here, I met many people and took pictures here.
Facilities: The facilities are also quite good.
Service: It‚Äôs just that the service is a bit behind. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because there are too many people on May 1st. I waited for almost half an hour when I checked out, and the luggage trolley from the concierge was not delivered to the room. I was anxious and only I was able to take the elevator down and check out by myself with my two children and my husband with big bags and three suitcases.
After all, it is a five-star hotel, and the breakfast is still very rich, and the rice rolls are more delicious. And each room is equipped with a butler. Our butler is a big beauty Oreo. The service is very thoughtful. If you have any questions, just ask Miss Oreo, the butler, and she will explain everything to you! Here is a big üëç!
The consumption in the hotel is very expensive, as the saying goes, is it a five-star hotel after all, two children are in the Edison Children's Paradise, and the consumption is about 5,000 yuan, which is indeed a bit high. The seawater pool is nice and open until lights out at 10pm. Because the seawater swimming pool is filtered seawater, it has great buoyancy, and swimming is super cool! Just have to bring your swimming goggles, the water is very salty. As for the infinity pool, we didn't have time to go. When we had time in the evening, it turned out that it was bar time at night, so the door was closed and we were not allowed to enter the infinity pool. It is recommended that you do not go out on May 11th, because the hotel will be very expensive. The same room type, during May 11th, is 5,000 to 6,000 a night, and usually 2,300 to 1 night. Of course, if you know a local tour guide or something, I heard from them that in the off-season, the same room type can be obtained for more than 1,000 yuan, and the service in the off-season is also good, because there are too many people in the peak season.
The Edison Hotel targets different customer groups, and it is more suitable for leisure and accommodation friends, and it is more comfortable.

Environment: Personally, I have been entangled in Edison and Oriental Culture, because I like the Southeast Asian style, but in the end Edison gave me the feeling that in addition to the light and luxurious hardware facilities, the overall garden design and greening are still a lot, not as expected Light luxury commercialization. Resort flavor is ok.
Facilities: The hotel's room facilities are definitely nothing to say, full of high technology. The bed and toiletries are comfortable.

Service: I would like to thank the hotel butler "Lang Li" for answering all questions and responding to every request. He has provided us with many services and conveniences, such as helping us with our luggage, printing documents, upgrading room types, recommending food, and proactively asking about needs, whether it is or not The hotel's range of services will help.
If you want to sit outdoors for the hotel's breakfast and buffet dinner, it is best to make a reservation in advance. The hotel's children's playground and children's pool are suitable for children around 6.7 years old. Kayaks have height requirements for children.
There are indeed a lot of people taking pictures in the lobby, and there are so many beauties, I feel like a jackass, haha. Bring your jersey next time and come again.

Although the room is full of monsoons, it is superior in comfort, simple and generous, much better than expected. The design of the room movement is also very reasonable, making it more comfortable to live in. I also like the flip flops in the room.
In terms of service, it was a bit surprising that there was no butler to contact in advance. The parking lot is far from the lobby, and it would be a bit tiring to carry the suitcase there. The lack of service from the entrance to check the order and parking to the hotel lobby, the experience is not very good. From the lobby, I am quite satisfied. There will be someone to help carry the luggage and send it to the room or parking lot after check-in and check-out. The follow-up service is similar to that of other hotels. There are fruits but no coconuts. Compared with the highly praised service mentioned in other reviews, I didn't feel it, I think it is just average. I made an appoin**ent to clean the room and went out to clean it for them, but I forgot the room and severely deducted points.
In addition, the variety of breakfast is average, but the taste is okay. Jin Restaurant‚Äôs dinner buffet is not recommended. The taste and ingredients are average. The small hot pot is not very hot, but the desserts are not bad.

The design style of the hotel and the overall environment are very good, each building is an independent scene, and it is a blockbuster if you take a photo! We are very satisfied with the service of the hotel. Yarra, the housekeeper, is very enthusiastic and the service is very good. He reminds us of the breakfast time every day and also helps us with late check-out. Jason and Luke of the water project are serious and responsible! Kelly in the gym is attentive and thoughtful. Seeing us sweating and taking the initiative to hand towels and water, she is always smiling and very cute! The room attendants Qi Huifang and Lin Qiuying were also very caring. Seeing that my husband loves drinking tea, they silently refilled us with water and even washed my dirty socks. This was beyond my expectation. And when I went to have breakfast the next day, the omelette chef still remembered my special request the day before, which really touched me! Thanks to the hotel and these lovely staff for making our trip a perfect one! Next time I come to Haitang Bay, I will choose the Sanya EDITION again!

Hygiene: very good
Environment: There are too many beauties who come to take pictures, and they look very rustic. The infinity pool is a bit small, and there are few people on the beach behind, which is also very clean.
Service: Compared with Wannings Westin, the front desk staff is a bit cold, but the brothers and sisters at the concierge at the door are very enthusiastic, and the service is generally passable.
Others: There are many types of breakfast; the starry sky bar is very good, the staff are very enthusiastic, and the price is very affordable. (I also met Teacher Bai Xiaobai during breakfast)
ps; Edison‚Äôs fragrance accessories are simply my favorite, and lelabo made them exclusively for them, so much so that when I arrived in Wanning, I was calling to ask if there was any way to buy them. I regretted that I didn‚Äôt ask for more when I was there. Looking forward to the opening of lelabo in Shanghai, I went to buy a bottle of 29~, which is said to be closer to the taste of the lobby.

msg:It‚Äôs the first time I brought my baby to Sanya and stayed at the EDITION Hotel. Before the check-in, the enthusiastic Miss Emily added WeChat in advance to prepare the things the baby needs in advance. In order to let the baby have a good rest, she checked us in in advance and helped us at any time. Solving any problem makes us feel cared and loved all the time‚ù§Ô∏è
After checking in, I was really attracted by the environment of Edison. You can take big pictures everywhere. The baby took a lot of beautiful photos here. The small disadvantage is that the sound insulation at the door of the room is not good, and people passing by can hear clearly. The baby does not have that kind of dark night light when sleeping at night (I don‚Äôt know if I can‚Äôt adjust it üòÇ)
Let‚Äôs talk about the food. There are a lot of bread, noodles, and fruits in the morning. I like the cup of coffee. It‚Äôs really delicious (I found out the next day ü•∫) The buffet seafood hot pot included in the package is also good. There is a hot pot barbecue ramen chef. Babies like to eat fine noodles made separately for babies
All in all, Edison's service is really good. The service staff will greet you with a smile wherever they go.

It is also worth mentioning that the two young ladies Tonghuifang and Yang Xianfei who are in charge of cleaning our room are really considerate. They bring beer and fruit from time to time. Seeing that we have the habit of drinking tea, they take the initiative to prepare more water every day. , Even the socks that were not washed the day before were washed and dried for us. It can really be said that every detail is done very well.
There is also Munire from the starry sky bar (I don‚Äôt know if I remember the name right), she is not only beautiful, but also very enthusiastic about work, and asked a lot about our opinions on the dishes so that we can improve them in the future. The service staff at the beach club, I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt remember their names, but they will all remember my preferences, and they will remember what I like to eat and where I like to sit when I go there for the second time.
There are so many caring moments, I believe I must choose Edison, which will bring you the most wonderful journey. Thanks to all the employees of Edison, the professionalism is first-class, the ceiling of the domestic hotel industry in my mind! üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª

msg:The Edison booked with trepidation. After all, the theme of this trip is parent-child. I don't know if the Internet celebrity hotel is really suitable. As a result, I was very satisfied from the moment I arrived to the 2-day check-in. First of all, Sister Huang Chang at checkin made professional arrangements. I am still impressed by her contagious smile, and the baby is also very amused by her; the housekeeper Runki is also very thoughtful and responds quickly to the guests' questions and requests. The details of the hotel will also have some small flaws, but the flaws are not concealed, such as the taste of food and beverages. This trip completely refreshed my definition of edition. The high popularity must be reasonable. When I checked out, I even felt that I knew that I had stayed in edition for four nights.

Facilities: There are plenty of parent-child activities and recreational facilities, friendly to young babies.
Hygiene: clean and tidy
Environment: The hotel is beautiful, needless to say
Service: very okkkkk

msg:The first time I stayed in the Edison was to investigate the wedding venue. I thought that the Internet celebrity hotel would be a little worried about the service, but I didn't expect the experience to far exceed expectations. In particular, I met a very good housekeeper, Helen, who provided uninterrupted service from the moment I entered the store, and responded to messages in a timely manner. She helped me reserve a room with a good view and took the initiative to delay my check-out. There was also a small gift when I left the store, but I was in a hurry and forgot to take it when I left, and I bothered her to send the courier, but the courier arrived before the person arrived home, anyway, it is very good üëç. Let‚Äôs talk about catering. I booked Tianlu a week in advance after reading the guide. The restaurant was not full. The food is amazing, even better than many western restaurants in Shanghai. It‚Äôs the top level I‚Äôve eaten recently. I suggest you give it a try. , none of the dishes are thunderous, and the service is super good. Ms. Iris is very gentle, and she squats to serve her all the time, and I feel sorry for her. To sum up, it‚Äôs good that the hotel guests are very young, but don‚Äôt have too much hope for the hotel rooms. The swimming pool entertainment facilities are closed relatively early, and the only activities that can be visited at night seem to be the bar. Pay attention to hotel services Comparable to the overall experience, it should be the most fancy hotel in Sanya!

This time I chose an internet celebrity room type. The view is really great. I am very happy that the floor also helped to arrange a high floor. The bathtub on the balcony is super big and the same as the hot spring pool. It is very good to take a bath in the wind at night or take a bath in the morning to watch the sunrise. . The bed in the room is also the favorite I have ever slept on. The sleep is super sound and the room is very quiet. Although the furnishing in the room is simple, it is unambiguous, and there is a lot of space, it is convenient to put things, and it is reasonable to walk without hitting the moving line at night without turning on the lights.
All the restaurants in the hotel are delicious, and the service attitude of the staff I encountered is super good. Many young ladies are very sweet and very patient. For breakfast, the radish and beef brisket are served with stewed noodles, and the room service Tom Yum Kung soup& Fried chicken, salted egg yolk shrimp balls from Xianhai, mango drinks at the beach bar, afternoon tea at the Starry Sky Bar, appetizers and desserts from Tianlu all left a deep impression on me, and the Edison is really the best among all the hotels. It is the most to my liking!
The scenery is very suitable for taking pictures. In the past two days, I have seen many beautiful internet celebrities taking pictures. The temperature of the heated swimming pool is suitable and the water quality is very good. There is also a hot massage pool next to it, which can also be used for playing. The scenery on the top floor is excellent. There has been no strong wind recently, so you can play comfortably.
Next time I stay, I will choose Edison to eat and drink here~

Oversized bathtub, oversized cloakroom. Oversized balcony, the scenery outside the window is extremely beautiful.
Designer design style.
The service staff here are quite friendly. Everyone will take the initiative to say hello.
The hotel has a total of 11 floors. Probably all of them are full.
The room will not come out until four or five in the afternoon.
I came here because I checked out from the Capella Hotel. It's noon.
After lunch, after shopping around the hotel. The room is not out yet.
The hotel upgraded me to a suite. Also gave a 500 yuan meal discount coupon.
The staff are quite polite. The service is really good. The hudson service in the housekeeping depar**ent is very professional.
Worthy of 4.8 points.

The hair dryer has also been replaced with a Dyson~ The hotel has a dior pop-up that is not tax-free, and there are all kinds of clothes~ You can shop around, and the service is also good~ The cabinet lady is very enthusiastic~

msg:I have been to Sanya many times, and this time I chose the Edition. Because of a good stay experience, my impression of Sanya will be changed. The service concept here is really good. As far as the service is concerned, the hotels in Haitang Bay, Sunny Bay‚Äôs Park Hyatt, Capella, etc. have a younger service team than the Edison, making it easier to get close to. The receptionist is called Xiaogu IRIS, who provides full service from check-in to check-out. The scenery is also extremely beautiful, and it is very good to take casual photos. Next time I come to Sanya, I will stay here for a longer period of time.

msg:First of all, I would like to thank Sanya Edition and thank yarra for giving us a perfect accommodation experience.
We had an early check in so had a walk around the whole hotel. What impresses me the most is the service attitude of the Edison staff, which makes people feel just right and very comfortable. Especially yarra, who led us to the room. If there is a need during the period, vx will respond quickly to her, which is really considerate.
In the lake center of the hotel, Dior's exhibition is very good, and the design and scene layout of the whole hotel are very good. The breakfast variety is very rich, and there are basically all the types you want to eat.
In fact, you can really go shopping in Edison for a day.
The Edison is already in my choice of hotel for future trips, and I look forward to seeing you next time, yarra really hopes to see you again‚ô•Ô∏è

The service of the hotel can be regarded as the domestic ceiling. I especially like chole at the front desk. Her service is warm and considerate. After knowing that it is the first time to send us here, she personally took us to find the room. Because the check-in time is not in the peak season, we asked chole Helped us upgrade the room and arranged a very good eviw, and also gave us a fruit plate and drink for the turndown service of the next day, and also gave us a canvas bag, which is very beautiful. I was tired from the flight, but she provided enthusiastic service Then we feel very heartwarming.

A concierge guy who was on duty around 12 o'clock in the evening on the 3rd (unfortunately I forgot to ask his name) carefully helped me find the courier several times. He was afraid that I would wait too long and even ran to personally Sent upstairs, polite and responsible.

The service of Miranda at the pool and beach club is also very attentive. She is very active in arranging the car for us and seriously asking if we are satisfied with the food and drinks.

Edison's service is really good. No matter where you go, everyone is warm and thoughtful. It can be regarded as a great job for staying in so many hotels at home and abroad. I will go back again if I have the opportunity.

Breakfast: There are many varieties, but the taste is not as expected

Cocktails and snacks at the beach club: good

The little brother Kim was very special: When the car arrived at the hotel in the afternoon, because the child was asleep and the entrance was windy, Kim decisively took off his suit to wrap the child and carried him all the way into the lobby (the child was heavy). Stay in an upgraded sea-facing room with a panoramic view. A small tent, fruit and mini bar are presented. During the stay, answer all questions and respond to every request, making us feel at home. They even picked us up and dropped us off at the end, which was great! !
The room is clean and tidy, the service is very considerate, there is not enough mineral water, so just bring a box.
The breakfast is rich in variety and tastes good, and the seafood hot pot for dinner is a comfortable dining environment.
The children's paradise has a variety of activities, and the children have fun.

msg:The Edison is definitely the top three hotels in Sanya.
One step at a time is not an exaggeration, there are good places to take pictures everywhere
The breakfast is rich and varied, and the coffee is the best in many hotels, but there are many people, and it is more comfortable to eat at off-peak hours.


The hotel staff are good-looking and considerate. As soon as we arrived at the hotel, Ms. Iris took us around the whole hotel and carefully introduced the design concept and details of each hotel. The professionalism is up, and we will prepare for the baby's birthday After getting a birthday giftüëç, Ms. Cheer also came to the room and warmly helped us arrange children's tents, restaurants and so on. Arrange bathrobes and slippers for the children, etc. üëçEverything is done first.
On the afternoon of the check-in day, we also went to the Children's Paradise, and met the super reliable sister Xiaozhu. After she learned that we wanted to celebrate the children's birthdays in the hotel, she brought a lot of lovely young ladies and brothers to help the children arrange the restaurant layout! üëçIt turns out that you can help arrange birthday activities not only in restaurants, but also in children's playgrounds! YYDS!
It should also be mentioned here that the table arrangement of the Jin restaurant was arranged with the help of Fugui's little brother, and the children liked it very much. üëç
In short, you can always trust the Edition, it is one of the hotels you will come to in the future‚ù§Ô∏è

After a long time, I decided to choose the Edition Hotel (my sister prefers Capella, but considering my little niece, I chose a hotel that is better for public facilities and parent-child travel) Haha Hahahaha proved that my aunt made the right choice. In the afternoon, I can enjoy the family swimming pool bubble party and the small train tour in the garden. In the evening, I can ask the housekeeper to arrange a bubble bath on the balcony. It‚Äôs just that the weather was not so good the past few days when we went thereü§• That‚Äôs right! Everyone can use the Marriott membership card when dining in the hotel or at the bar! I am a gold card and can enjoy a 20% discount! Really worth it! ! ! The bbq dinner area is super chill, but remember to call and make an appoin**ent in advance! And there are not so many internet celebrity ladies and sisters mentioned on the Internet, it is much better than I imagined, so I really enjoyed this journey~

msg:It's the first time to live here, it was recommended by a friend. It can be said that the appearance and furnishings of the hotel are very design, American modern, with wooden grille partitions and screens that can be seen everywhere. The hidden wooden door of the lobby is high-end and low-key. My friend said that the night scene is like Las Vegas, so let me tell you about my feelings in several aspects:
In terms of service and details: Runki, the housekeeper, gave a lot of practical tips from the beginning of check-in, and there may be a 5% discount for staying in the hotel to go to the duty-free shop (I only found out after I left the store, I was careless hahaha), so everyone should read carefully. The welcome fruit is very delicate. During the stay, there was a companion's birthday. I asked about it the night before, and Runki sent a cake the next afternoon. It was a great surprise, and it was really responsive üòÑ. At the same time, the service staff in the room is also very considerate, because I want to use bottled water to boil water, and when I return to the room at night, it has already been cooked for us. I found the protective suit on the table the next night, very thoughtful. The view of the room is very good, the balcony is very big, and you can watch the sunrise.
In terms of food and entertainment: the hotel has a rich breakfast, and I like Hou'an powder the most, and I ate it for 2 days (personally, it tastes better than the previous urban area). In addition to the swimming pool, there are also kayaks to play. The hotel is very close to the duty-free shop, only a few hundred meters away.
Because you need to wait for a room to check in, the front desk gave you meal vouchers. The hot pot buffet has many choices and tastes good, but why is the hot pot so small, 1 person uses 1 pot, and 2 people share 1 pot? 2 pots for 3 people, 2 pots for 4 of us, I don't understand. The Xianhai restaurant is also good, the scallops and salted egg yolk shrimp balls are delicious, and the indoor environment is very formal.

msg:I was very impressed with the Edison after staying for three days. Let‚Äôs talk about the advantages first. The service is really good and warm. The hotel garden is absolutely unique. Every step is a scene, and there are Internet celebrities and scenes everywhere. Let's talk about the shortcomings, the rooms are simple and simple, too ordinary and simple without a sense of luxury, and even a bit old-fashioned. The sound insulation on the floor of the room is very poor. The children upstairs are playing loudly, and the sound is very loud. This experience is very poor. Even the sound insulation of the rooms in Atlantis, which is famous for being crowded and lively, is better than this! Another one is the cleaning staff, who obviously pressed the Do Not Disturb mode, but kept ringing the doorbell and making phone calls, cooperating with you to finish your work regardless of the guests resting? This has happened several times, not once or twice, the most important thing in a hotel is people-oriented! Finally, I would like to thank the guest relations Gueena for her enthusiastic service during her stay and for giving me a small toy. To sum up, the experience of these three days is too bad. I will not consider going to Sanya to play Edison in the future!

The room service is very good, the staff who clean the room are polite and enthusiastic, and the cleaning is timely and meticulous. The facilities in the room are relatively complete, but simple, there is no scale for the human body, and the pillows are low and small. The service at the front desk is mediocre, maybe it was too busy due to the sudden increase in passenger flow, it feels like a salesperson in a state-owned store in the 1980s, with a blunt and indifferent attitude. There are many varieties of breakfast, which are western style. Due to the arrangement of the lower floor, it is more biased, so I implore to change the room to no avail. The feeling of the sea view is not strong, and it looks like a lake view room. Compared with the price, the price/performance ratio is a bit unsatisfactory.

‚≠ïÔ∏èEdison's meal is also good!
‚≠ïÔ∏èThere are many swimming pools here, children's, adults', wave-making, and the infinity pool on the 12th floor. There is a bar in the swimming pool. It's a pity that I couldn't go to the New Year's Eve with my baby! Every night, many little brothers and sisters come, hahaha, it's like Gongti.

One-to-one butler service, real name recommendation of Evelyn, caring service throughout the whole process, the first online evaluation for Edison in my lifetime. As for the all-season style of decoration mentioned on the Internet, it is the latest popular style of silence, which is different from the luxury style. Let me justify the name of Edison

msg:I took a walk-and-go trip with my family, and I was very lucky to book a room in the Edison. The whole hotel is very beautifully designed, and I feel so beautiful from the moment I enter. The lobby is also beautifully designed and creative. The staff They are very conscientious, very concerned about the needs of customers in the store, and will actively provide help.

The housekeeper who checked in this time was Evelvy. Although she arrived late that day, she patiently and meticulously introduced the hotel's services and rooms in detail; any questions, she responded super quickly on WeChat; super caring and patient lady!

Sanya is a bit of a gourmet desert. It is not easy to find a restaurant with both taste and environment, but Edison has a lot of food choices, with both environment and taste. If you want to eat, you can ask the butler to help you book in advance.

Edison's toiletries, including details (such as Dyson hair dryer), are well done; I will still choose Edison when I come to Sanya again!

msg:A very pleasant staying experience

With the Spring Festival approaching, the passenger flow of hotels, especially the ones that are bursting with popularity, has increased sharply. There must be omissions and deficiencies in management and service

For example, when I check in on the first day, I can usually check in after 3 o‚Äôclock. I waited from 1 o‚Äôclock to nearly 6 o‚Äôclock (knowing that I‚Äôm busy, so I deliberately arrived early to queue up for check-in). It‚Äôs such a waste of a day. Very angry, but Kim, a young handsome guy, the hotel housekeeper, after knowing my situation, firstly faced my anger positively and did not shirk it. This is worthy of praise, and settled us tired and thirsty. In the temporary rest room, although I was still very angry, I worked there for 2 hours, changed my clothes, took a shower, dazed, and finally went out to go to the spa....

But after I came back, I actively contacted me many times to deal with the situation, and it didn‚Äôt end there. I made a mistake in my busy schedule, and I forgot to put our luggage in the room. After apologizing, the parents and children killed us to get the luggage for us, and tried to make up for it as quickly as possible. , Respond to messages quickly and effectively, really think about the guests, and meet the needs of the guests. Sally in the starry sky bar is also very good. She is cheerful, enthusiastic and loves to laugh. Let us spend a wonderful afternoon tea time~


Overall, I feel pretty good about the Edison, and its flaws are not hidden. Although it is busy, the service staff are enthusiastic at work and communicate with customers to deal with various emergencies. The concierge brothers who open the door and carry luggage are all running here. Details Touching people's hearts, you can feel that Edison's leadership does not treat employees badly, hahaha, empathizing with each other, employees will be so active and enthusiastic in facing customers~virtuous circle~nice!

msg:I read on the Internet that the service is good, so let me tell you about my personal experience. The service was good when I first entered the gate, but it got worse and worse after entering. 1: The hotel told us that the room card would not come out until five o‚Äôclock. We walked together in the hotel. There was a pink classic car in the garden ready to take pictures. The doorman from Hainan said he needed a room card. We said he hadn‚Äôt processed it for us yet. , Can you see the reservation information, he sternly rejected us, really speechless, obviously the hotel has not been cleaned. 2. After breakfast in the morning, I put on my bathrobe and went down. I was told that I can‚Äôt bring my bathrobe for breakfast. I said I would take it in and take it off before picking up the meal. She said no. Wearing short-sleeved pajamas inside is embarrassing and cold, and my mood has been ruined all day; your hotel doesn't inform you, and the service staff has a bad attitude. If you are short of money, you can get the whole bathrobe cheap, and you are not afraid of damage. It really loses the luxury brand s face. The breakfast was not delicious, and there were too many people, so I got up and ate for nothing. 3. The room looks like an express hotel, the toilet is not smart, and the quilt cover is not set properly, see the picture. 4. It's petty to death, the mini refrigerator is all charged, and the welcome fruit is only given after asking, and **** asked if there is a Marriott member. This hotel is like that kind of **, just don't spend money on details to make you feel pretty good, and don't do anything that costs money. 5. Beach barbecues and beach clubs are not the imagined atmosphere either. 6. Sanya has been cold recently, and it is impossible to swim. The heated swimming pool is very small. Anyway, I just got angry and went to the hotel, and whoever stayed again would ****.

It wasn't until this time that I went to live here that I realized the sense of luxury revealed everywhere. The selection of books is also great, and Mr. Tadao Ando's best light and shadow are also reflected everywhere in the hotel. Needless to say about the hotel design, scda's design is really great and ingenious, with simple lines, clean colors and moving scenes. The service of the hotel is also great, thanks to the front desk for helping me upgrade the room type, and thanks to Brandon for his considerate service, the service started before the trip started, until we left. There is also Eva from Xianhai Restaurant, who took the initiative to help me take pictures. She was very patient and would tell me how to pose better, which is super awesome. This trip to Edison is very satisfying, and the hotel has a lot of activities. I will go again next time. The photos are really not enough hahaha, there are beautiful scenery everywhere. Also, the bathtub is really ridiculously big hahaha, bathtub + soaking pool, the bathing star is perfect.

msg:Room: It's the first time I stayed in the Edison, and I booked a room with an amu*****t park. The room is very big, and it's very good to watch the sunrise in the morning.

Hotel facilities: The decoration is relatively simple, but it is still open, the amu*****t park is also very large, and there will be a car to pick up and drop off

Service: The service this time is really amazing, especially thanks to my butler Andy Cai, (if the hotel sees this comment, please be sure to add chicken legs to him, he is really excellent). Because he brought the baby, he arranged all the baby supplies in the room in advance, the mineral water for the milk, and coordinated with the chef Rory to provide our baby with fresh ingredients every day. The most commendable thing is that Andy responds to all WeChat messages in seconds, and is responsive to requests. He can think ahead for customers and help us arrange restaurant reservations in advance during the peak season of the Chinese New Year. Thank you very much. He also helped us apply for Marriott membership , let's take a discount. He didn't need to do it, but he did it all. The devils are all in the details, Manager Cai is very meticulous. It is entirely because of Manager Cai that we have a very smooth life with our baby these days. I would rate the hotel 70 points, and Manager Cai personally +25 points!

The waiters in the restaurant are also well trained, and they will take the initiative to interact with the baby, very polite!


shortcoming:
The snacks provided by the minibar are average, it would be great if there are some potato chips

It's a pity that the beach is not managed by the hotel, there are a little more miscellaneous people outside, and there are no water sports in this sea, which is a little less interesting

We will definitely bring our babies again in the future, thank you Manager Cai, thank you Edison

Later, when it opened, the housekeeper also notified us as soon as possible, including after checking out, the watch was forgotten. I contacted the housekeeper, and found it in time.

msg:I came here in the peak tourist season in January and stayed for two consecutive days. The environment and the cultural concept of the hotel are indeed unique in Haitang Bay. Kim Xiaojin of guest relations took the initiative to inquire about the needs throughout the process, and the service was meticulous. The room service cleans up the room and replenishes consumables n times a day, and I like it in place.
But, I'm going to say no now! On the third day, there were still some lingering things. The hotel was doing joint publicity with Dior, and an area was set up in the middle of the water sports area for promotional photos (see the last picture I uploaded). I went to take pictures at 9:56 in the morning, and the on-site management The security guards blocked the isolation fence and said that they had to enter at 10 o'clock before the time. At that time, there was no one at the scene except me and my wife. I said it was only a few minutes away and there was no one. I went in and took two photos and then came out. The security guard also said that he got off work at 10 o'clock, and told us to wait for the person who returned to his shift to come before letting us in. We waited at the scene until 10:02, and when we didn‚Äôt see any so-called shift personnel, we came forward to ask for the third time. The security guard was obviously impatient and told us to show our room card or we would not be allowed to enter. After we showed our room card, the security guard emphasized loudly Take photos without touching their display area facilities. After entering, I found that the so-called display facilities were just fake classic cars (not real cars). For the first time, I deeply felt the saying that x looks down on people! It really destroyed the overall impression of Edison in an instant. Why bother to embarrass the guests staying in the area that was supposed to be a promotional and photo-taking area! Why bother to embarrass the guests like this! Is this hotel really that superior? ! Gathering sand into a tower, I sincerely suggest that the hotel train well, and reflect on why so many guests give you bad reviews!

There are not many people in the hotel, the experience is very good
Butler Xiaojin has upgraded the base of our reserved room type
Also arranged the room and prepared cakes and fruits
Because I look forward to seeing the sea for a long time
It feels great to finally be able to step out of the balcony and see the sea in the room
sit down and do nothing
Slowly feeling the sea breeze blowing, quite relaxing
Catching up with the Dior exhibition, taking pictures is still very good
You don‚Äôt have to go out to play when you choose a resort hotel
A basic hotel is enough for a whole day
Kayaking, feeding the fish, swimming, chatting in the starry sky bar...
Let the butler arrange the bubble bath in advance at night
That's the end of a perfect day

Another one that impressed me The details are that during afternoon tea at the Starry Sky Bar in the hotel, the little brother who served us remembered that he also served us when I was celebrating my birthday at the bar the night before. The waiter brother, because we are three girls, the afternoon tea set only includes two glasses of champagne, so he gave us an extra glass of champagne for free, which is really very caring. Another waiter and sister also gave it to us during afternoon tea that day. I gave a fruit plate, but unfortunately I didn't remember the name, but I still want to thank her.

Miss sunny, who received our guests in the early stage, is very patient and the service is really good! Informed about everything. The hotel rooms are really intentional. Because of work reasons, I often travel on business, and I have stayed in too many five-star hotels of large and small foreign companies. It is rare to have this feeling of being amazed again. The overall service management of the hotel must be very good. Walking around the hotel, basically if you encounter the hotel staff, they will take the initiative to say hello to us. The hotel also helps us meet some personalized needs as much as possible. I think this is the spirit and charm that Marriott's top luxury hotel should have. This also makes us more firmly identify with the Edison brand! It is in line with our own character, simple but not simple, quiet and elegant but can reflect luxury and dignity everywhere. As long as this level can be maintained, our Sanya accommodation will not consider changing to other hotels. The overall environment of the hotel has no choice, and it will naturally not be bad at this level. On the contrary, the open-air swimming pool is really novel enough, and the scenery really needs on-site experience to feel different. The hotel also has a cooperative store with Dior. It is really convenient to visit the hotel without leaving the hotel. I hope to cooperate with Chanel next time, and I will definitely fly over and continue to live! Thanks for the service and care of the hotel! See you next time!

msg:The two nights I was most satisfied with for the 12 days in Hainan were in the EDITION. Before, I was worried that the service would not be good and the people would be chaotic during the summer vacation, but when I really came, these worries all disappeared. The reservation record will be checked at the entrance of the hotel, and it is not allowed to enter the hotel without a reservation, which prevents a large number of Internet celebrity tourists who come to take photos. Entering the hotel, because we came early, there is no room for the time being, we need to wait for a while, the front desk finally gave us a 1,000 yuan coupon for Jin Restaurant. Here I would like to praise the front desk Norah. The first thing I ordered was the basic room type I booked. The higher floor (not to mention the scenery); knowing that our last day was on the plane after 8 o'clock in the evening and taking the children by ourselves, he took the initiative to help me find the manager to negotiate and extend my stay until 5 o'clock in the afternoon on the day of check-out. (This is the summer vacation room is really full); take the initiative to introduce the various facilities of the hotel to me, and take the children to help me take the initiative to note the various depar**ents to take care of them. All in all, help me take care of everything. During the two-day stay, the waiters at various positions also took the initiative to say hello, and help me find a solution at any time if there is any problem.
Although there are indeed a lot of people for breakfast (after all, it is the peak summer season), as long as you go during the peak hours, you don‚Äôt have to queue up. The Chinese and Western dishes are complete, and the freshly squeezed juice and coconut ice cream at the door are my favorites.
Needless to say, the hardware of the hotel is full of scenery, and the camera can't stop at all.

Transportation: Haitang Bay, very close to duty-free shops

msg:My favorite hotel before and after coming to Sanya. Although traveling with children, InterContinental and Crowne Plaza are more in line with the parent-child theme, but I prefer the overall design and modern facilities of the EDITION, the rooms are simple and a**ospheric, the breakfast is rich, the children's pool and the beach club artificial beach pool have their own characteristics, responsible for the guests Ashley Lili, who is very friendly, is kind, pleasant, and meticulous. She introduced us to the room, and also intimately informed the use and location of the hotel's facilities, giving people a feeling like a spring breeze. The security guard by the beach of the hotel has a good look. Not only will you take the initiative to ask if you need a shuttle bus back to the room or the lobby, but also remind you not to agree to the invitation of the black motorboat and black photography, because the government requires the hotel to be at risk. When the security guard sees a guest going to the sea, he will notify the supervisor, and the supervisor will immediately come to dissuade several guests from going to the sea. After that, I warmly invited my baby and I, who were waiting for the shuttle bus, to take their shuttle police car and go back to the lobby together, so Witnessing the whole process, I feel that the hotel security team is really responsible and reassuring. When checking out, the lady also gave her a children's paradise beach bag, and the deduction was confirmed by phone in time. In view of the overall service experience is very good, also like the hotel's swimming pool, will come again next time!

There was absolutely no service at all, so I booked the EDITION right away, luckily there was still room.
As soon as you arrive at the lobby, someone will greet you and accompany you to check in. Then he took us around the hotel.
The hotel is really beautiful! The details are very well done! This is beyond the reach of ordinary hotels. The only regret is that the beach barbecue can never be booked.‚Ä¶
A big thank you to Ashley for giving us a perfect score for our entire stay!

msg:The hotel is designed with care, and the rooms are minimalist and have their own style, not the kind that blindly pursue luxury. The housekeeper is good, but the service staff I occasionally meet in the lobby is a bit arrogant, and seems to look down on people and is very proud. The check-in was not very pleasant, there were a lot of people, but there was no organized queue, and no one took care of jumping in the queue at will. Besides, I had already checked in at 4:00 pm, but the room was not ready, and I didn't check in until almost 6:00 pm. Instead, a temporary rest room was arranged for me, but I don't know if that room was just renovated or something. The pungent smell was so strong that I couldn't stay in the room at all. Sitting on the balcony, it was still very hot that day, I was really angry. However, the room that was arranged for me later was in a great location and had a first-class view, so I was relieved. After checking in, the overall feeling is ok, very comfortable, there are many swimming pools, very large, but there are two swimming pools that children can't go to, which is a bit regrettable. The beach club pool bar is very good. If you are going on vacation, it is really good to have three or five friends drinking and chatting at night.

msg:Living in the Sanya EDITION is the meaning of my vacation in Sanya again. Less than a month since the last time, I returned to the Sanya EDITION and returned to a natural good mood. Even though the typhoon blew away the sun, the Edison in the wind and rain is still beautiful.

Happiness is simple, natural, plain. Simple and transparent room design, so that the room is not separated from the sea and the sky, and the eyes are full of breathtaking scenery. The hotel's landscape design is ingenious. The hotel's inland sea is connected to the artificial seawater swimming pool, and visually connected to the blue sea and blue sky of Haitang Bay, which is quite gradual and infinite. As the sun rises in the east and sets in the west, the scenery is changing every moment of the day. I like to let go here and feel the changes and beauty of nature.

Happiness is transmissible, healing, beautiful. From the moment you step into the front door of the hotel reception, you can feel the professionalism of the EDITION service team, as well as the enthusiasm and happiness of every staff member. There will be a little brother who will take the luggage for temporary storage and escort it to the front desk of check-in. If it's rush hour there's definitely a queue, but every worker is doing things as efficiently as possible. I like every positive and happy Addison's partner, feel their sincere smiles relieve a little tiredness of my journey.

Because of Typhoon Siamba, when I checked out early, I saw a foreigner helping guests with luggage at the door. I felt like someone from the hotel management. Later, I asked my hotel steward to find out that it was Rob, the deputy manager of the hotel, because There have been many guests staying recently, and the top executives of the hotel are often on the front line and do it themselves. No wonder the EDITION has always been the most popular hotel in Sanya, because happiness is contagious and addictive.

Last but not least, I still have a special thank you to my customer relationship manager Sunny, who is on sick leave, still helps me get to the high floor I want, and prepares, welcome fruit and edison coconut. It made my second trip to the Sanya EDITION still full of joy and touching.

The Sanya EDITION, see you next time.

ps: This time, I also tasted the afternoon tea at the Star Bar and the buffet seafood hot pot barbecue in the evening. It's all great, so I won't go into details here.

Whether it is the hotel design hardware package or the catering service, it is worth going again next time. Especially the beach BBQ, which is expensive but delicious. Children and adults alike had a great time. Although it is a designer hotel, it is also very suitable for taking children. The housekeeper Kim also prepared balloons and cakes in the room.

To be honest from Junyue, it doesn't feel very good. Lots of people, lots of kids. . Coming to Addison, it gives people a bright feeling. First of all, the style of the hotel is very suitable for my taste, which is enough to be an internet celebrity.
When I went to the front desk to check in, the handsome guy at the front desk, Brady, served me warmly. Lucky‚ûï helped me to get a room that I could check in immediately in the morning. I was very lucky, and he was also enthusiastic to guide me. Help with booking a beach BBQ. Great praise for Brady handsome guy.

There is no choice in the hotel environment, and the room decoration is simple style. Blockbusters are available everywhere in the hotel.

Favorite Dior joint pool. You can also drink (children are not allowed in)

Wide variety of breakfast and ice cream

In short, a very happy trip to the Addison, I will stay again next time (trying to make money to live in a villa)

Finally, I would like to thank Brady at the front desk again for his enthusiastic work, which gave me a good start to my Edison trip‚ûï an unforgettable itinerary.

msg:The second time I stayed in the EDITION, compared to the first time, I added a beach club, similar to the feeling of a pool party, with more Dior pop-up stores and Dior swimming pools, and the hair dryer was also upgraded to Dyson. The spirit of the hotel wanting to improve and not rot is really good. There is still no problem with the service, and the quality of the breakfast is ok, but the time is still at 10:30. For me, who can't afford to visit the scenic spots early is just a vacation and wants to sleep in. The guests are not very friendly. Now many hotels, such as Capella, have breakfast until 11:00. This time, the EDITION was temporarily booked for two nights due to the change of the itinerary. I booked the same room type once, but this time I didn‚Äôt welcome coconuts and fruits. When I opened the door, I lacked a sense of surprise and intimacy. If I remember correctly, the first time I came here, I could check in at three o‚Äôclock in the afternoon. This time it became four o‚Äôclock. , when checking out, the housekeeper application can be extended to one point at the latest. Capella's room type is also very tight. You can check out at two o'clock and check in at three o'clock. It seems to be more humane, just sauce~

Before coming here, I was a little worried that it would not be suitable for children. Unexpectedly, the two children were taken care of very well throughout the whole trip. The children's club has very rich activities and a children's swimming pool. It's also great. I would like to express my special thanks to Kim for his ceiling-level service. He arranged a children's tent and a free extra bed for us. We also specially arranged a bubble bath at night. I learned that the children like to eat cakes. The next night A whole piece of chocolate cake was delivered directly after turning down the bed. I really want to say that there is no intention to please, but they try their best to meet the customer's needs within their scope of authority, and even exceed the customer's expectations. Moreover, every service staff in the hotel is very polite. The service is warm and considerate. I have stayed in 90% of the hotels in Sanya. The EDITION is definitely the number one in my heart. The key point is that the beef ****y delivered after turning down the bed is super delicious. I will come again at Christmas~ Looking forward to my next trip

Waited until 7pm to get the room card. Staying in so many five-star hotels is really unprecedented. I asked a friend who came a few days ago, and I also encountered this situation. All room service is full of long long waits. The hotel is clearly suffering from serious staffing and management issues. After living in Intercontinental and Fairmont, there is no such negative situation at all. The service is just worlds apart. All in all a very disappointing experience at The Edition.

I was told that there was no room and I had to wait. I left my children in the hotel to wait for the room because I was going to do something. I urged them once, but they told me that they could check in at 3:30 in the afternoon! There was no welcome fruit or welcome card in the room. The water in the swimming pool was too cold to swim! Breakfast was a mess like a big cafeteria. I registered for tea and it was not served after the meal! Now it is the peak tourist season and many people affect the service quality!

There is also an indoor children's playground on the G floor, taking into account parent-child activities.

Hotel meals are good, but the number of seats and the proportion of hotel rooms are not right, so dining is not very convenient.

I have stayed in many resort hotels and the EDITION's service can be among the best

Exclusive butler one-to-one service
Any problem can be solved in time
For restaurant reservations, children's services, hotel activities, and photography, you can consult the housekeeper and help with reservations. Special praise Ashley Lili is very serious and responsible üëç

Transportation: 40 minutes from the airport to the hotel
Hygiene: clean and tidy
Service: warm and in place
The breakfast is very rich. For me who loves coffee, freshly ground iced coffee is the beginning of the day

Remind you ladies,
Many people and restaurants need to book in advance during holidays and summer vacations. I hope everyone can have a happy vacation‚õ±Ô∏è

It was 2:00 in the afternoon, but it was not possible to check in at 3:00, and it was 4:00, so it was 4:00. The service staff took the initiative to contact you to get the room card, but they still called to ask about it. After asking, various connections were still not normal, and finally went to the front desk to get the room card. The service of this kind of resort hotel is really bad. And breakfast, Capella's breakfast is several blocks away. In short, I will not stay in this kind of hotel with Internet celebrity and no service in the future.

msg:1. Positioning: Known as the top hotel in Sanya, personal experience should belong to the top, the first is definitely not, it is not as good as Capella. As for the ranking, the benevolent sees the benevolence, the wise sees the wisdom, and it depends on the specific experience of the individual.
2. Facilities: There are luxury stores, such as Dior, there is no price advantage, maybe considering the geographical advantage. Convenient shopping, just like the convenience store at the door, the price is not affordable. On the day of moving in, it has been raining, and many have not experienced it. Due to the weather, the Internet celebrity punched in, and the effect could not be detected. Swimming pool in general, normal swimming pool bar. One on the top floor and one on the first floor, there are kayaks for rowing. There are villas and single houses. The children's playground is also normal. A family-friendly hotel. Some simple rides. I think hotels in Sanya should highlight their features, such as couples vacations, don't need parent-child projects, just create a clean one. Highlight a point. The parent-child play hotel has a large number of children's play items. It's hard to think that it contains a lot, it would be contradictory. Complete fusion is not possible.
Room facilities, fresh, clean, simple. There is no electric toilet. I found that most of the hotels in Sanya do not have electric toilets. Is it because the occupancy rate is too high and it is not easy to clean. No welcome fruit. Check-in is slow, the procedures are complicated, and personal information, family information, etc. must be constantly verified. Wrong luggage. The breakfast is rich, clean and hygienic. It is required to bring a mask to take meals. But it is crowded and crowded. All Sanya hotels face the problem of overcrowded breakfast restaurants during peak season. I brought my children to Sanya for two consecutive summer vacations and settled in several top hotels. Breakfast is always crowded, waiting for a table and queuing for food. Indeed, the problem of breakfast in peak season is a challenge for all top hotels in Sanya.
  Restaurants: 4, beach barbecue, can't be booked at all, it is suggested whether the guests who are staying in the hotel can be given priority. rather than fully open to the outside world. Fresh seafood was not available. After eating at Tianlu Western Restaurant, there is a queue for a table, which is more chaotic and affects the experience of staying. Breakfast in the Chinese restaurant, lunch at noon, not crowded. But serving was slow. Once the restaurants in the top hotels are full, the problem will be solved. Starry Sky Bar has no experience, no evaluation.
Service, service is better, when we settled in, typhoon, rainstorm. The service staff are all umbrellas, and welcome the guests in the rain. There are foreign reception staff, fluent in spoken English, more than enough to deal with foreign guests. During the peak summer season, the hotel will hire interns, part-time jobs, etc. Although I want to be very enthusiastic, I am obviously not skilled. Sometimes it backfires and more training is recommended.

There are four pools, one of which is saltwater, but...the pools are a bit shallow for me who likes to swim...but every pool is beautiful! There is also a little bad experience, that is, the sound insulation of the hotel room is not good. After falling asleep for two nights, I was woken up by the sound of laughter and screaming and the sound of high heels closing the door back and forth... Except for this, others are very satisfied ~ I would like to live in the EDITION every time I go to Sanya in the future, I hope I can improve my shortcomings and keep it beautiful~

When we arrived at the hotel, the door was a bit busy, and a foreigner greeted us warmly and helped us drag our suitcases to the front desk. Then I learned that the foreigner is actually a hotel GM, I didn't expect the GM to be so friendly.
The housekeeper, Brandon, learned that his friend was staying for the first time, and he enthusiastically took us to the public area of the hotel. The friend said that he could stay in the hotel all day without going out.
The cause of the epidemic requires nucleic acid testing. The hotel also provides nucleic acid testing services attentively. Every day around 17:00, specialized medical staff come to the designated location of the hotel to do nucleic acid testing. This is so convenient.
The Dior pop-up store in the hotel is still there, the Dior swimming pool is also a real fasion, and there are many good-looking young ladies.

The above is the extra experience of this stay. Others such as the cleanliness of the hotel room, comfortable bedding, cleanliness, timely service but not making you feel stared at all the time. The whole is completely in line with the definition of a good hotel in my mind.

Of course, the dishes are also on the line. As a "middle and high level foodie", I sincerely recommend it. Ha ha ha ha! And its seawater swimming pool should also be praised, it should be the largest in Haitang Bay! The sea water is filtered and then pumped into the swimming pool. It is soft and slippery and very comfortable. Recently, a new bar club was established by the swimming pool. It is only for the use of residents. In the afternoon, there will be DJs playing discs and drinking a small wine while soaking in the swimming pool. üåøwork hard, play hard!

Under the epidemic, the staff of other hotels have been greatly reduced, but EDITION still maintains a high staff-to-room ratio, and can immediately get excellent and professional service anywhere. It is worth learning from other hotels in Sanya

The housekeeper AD received us very warm and attentive, because it was the first time we stayed and gave a detailed introduction to the hotel, and also helped to book a beach barbecue. Now because of the epidemic, we don't need to make an appoin**ent in advance. He said that it would be half a month in advance. About...we were lucky.
The hotel's washing and bathing supplies are my favorite. The fragrance is very good and the hygiene is very clean. The whole hotel can be in a daze and play for two or three days. The swimming pool is open to the outdoor swimming pool on the G floor and the infinity pool on the 12th floor. There is also a beach club where you can listen to hi songs and drink.
The whole hotel is very comfortable. I will come back to stay in Sanya next time~

On the first day of staying in the bathroom, there was long hair that was not cleaned, which made people feel a little down. Because of the rain on the second night, there were many white ants infested at night, and the whole room was densely packed, but the housekeeper quickly dealt with it and changed the room for me, and the service was good.

üçÉEnvironment: During the epidemic, there are rooftop swimming pools and beach swimming pools, as well as an artificial sea for boating. The environment is also good. Although the occupancy rate is not very high on May 1st, it is still very quiet. Compared to the Atlantis where I stayed later, it was really quiet.
There is not much comment on the room. Many people say that it is a full-season decoration, and they are right, but the room is big enough, although the two bathtubs are not used. For the evaluation of Sanya Ceiling Hotel, I personally think it is a little worse.

While understandable, satisfaction with the hotel has dropped significantly. At three o'clock at night, I was woken up by the noise of dragging furniture. I called the front desk three times, but no one answered. Really eye-popping. Even a hotel in a small county will have someone on duty at night. When I complained in the morning, the hotel's explanation was drunk, and the customer service manager on duty also came to the door to explain and apologize. We didn't dwell on it too much, but reminded the hotel that it's a shame to go unanswered at night. Especially five star hotels. Hope that the hotel will strengthen management in the future. Even with this little episode, I still like this hotel.

The heated swimming pool in the Starry Sky Bar is highly recommended. The night view is excellent. After all, it is winter in Sanya.

In particular, I would like to mention Miss Dany who provided me with services~ She answered all my questions attentively, and then found out that I am from Sanya, and I know a lot of scenic spots~ That little expression without showing off is super cute~ The service is super considerate ( Miss sister has a treasure emoji) which adds points to the overall feeling of the hotel!

Another: It is recommended to add a few cars to the concierge depar**ent. The area of this hotel is quite large. It takes a long time to go to the beach and wait at the door.

Good luck and happy new year~

It‚Äôs been 5 years since the internet celebrity attribute, but it still looks like a newly opened hotel, which is worthy of praise
The entire hotel whether it is a room or a restaurant or a bar
All maintenance is still so brand new
This time I found out that both Dior and SND have opened stores
The elements of luxury and fashion are well integrated
There is also a low-key art exhibition hall
This time I did a joint seaside creation by two artists
It really penetrates the hotel's own IP to the fullest
Back to the hotel room, in terms of user experience
I think it‚Äôs very stable, even very warm in detail processing
The guest housekeeper Samantha is very nice
From welcoming us to checking in, everything was in order
Seeing that I took my daughter, I immediately sent a small toy
Children especially like toys
The warmth delivered by a small piece is worthy of praise, hope to continue
I returned to the hotel at night and found three coconuts on the table
This is also Samantha's friendliness. There is a little detail
Samantha saw my wife and I joined the wife‚Äôs WeChat
Didn‚Äôt directly contact me ‚ûï WeChat, this is a great job
It‚Äôs inevitable that if men and women stay together in such a luxurious hotel,
Taking the initiative ‚ûï the man‚Äôs WeChat will inevitably cause the woman‚Äôs weirdness haha
BBQ on the beach and starry sky bar, soso
It‚Äôs worth punching in, it‚Äôs not worth remembering, and it‚Äôs still a lot of work on the product.
Don‚Äôt just treat it as a tourist business
Should be treated like afternoon tea products
So afternoon tea must be worth trying
I wrote a lot of words, I still have a deep love for Edison
Ctrip's comment is not much fun. See you in Dianping.
I wish the hotel better and better, and I wish Samantha every day.

First of all, this is the first EDITION in China. The EDITION continues Ian‚ÄÇSchrager's design concept, and the trendy decoration style still makes the EDITION stand out among the hotels in Haitang Bay, Sanya. I have all the respect for all Ian‚ÄÇSchragers.
The entire design of the lobby is very international and diversified, such as the design of the modular structure, the surrounding water body, the moment you step into the lobby, the full sense of ceremony, the moment you take the room card package and open it, you can feel the wooden room card. gentle texture. This kind of room card design is rare in the international five-star hotel, very classic and elegant.
Minimal but not simplify.
Staying in the sea view king room, the bath products are limited edition LE‚ÄÇLABO‚ÄÇEDITION, the bed should be adjusted later, (the stone brick wall should be the original bedside background wall) Now the end of the bed is facing the floor-to-ceiling window, at six o'clock in the evening, Standing on the balcony, you can see the boundary between the coconut forest and the sea, and you can also see the bright lights of Wuzhizhou Island, which are magnificent and graceful...
In short, whether it is a restaurant or a spa, afternoon tea or a lobby, or even an elevator, the design is exquisite and the experience is perfect.
Tonight's buffet is also a very delicate surprise...
Not finished, continue tomorrow...
Happy new year everyone üçæÔ∏èüéÜ

"Experience as a designer - Sanya Addison Hotel"

First of all, this is the first Edison hotel in China. Edison continues Ian Schrager's design philosophy. The trendy decoration style still makes Edison lead the way among the hotels in Begonia Bay, Sanya. I respect all Ian Schrager.

The whole design of the lobby is very international and diversified, such as the design of the module architecture, the surrounding water body, and the moment you enter the lobby, there is a sense of ceremony. The moment you open and use the room card package, you can feel the gentle texture brought

by the wooden room card. Such room card design is rare in international five-star hotels, which is very classic and elegant.

Simple but not simple.

CHECK IN THE GUANHAI QUEEN ROOM. THE BATHROOM IS LIMITED BY LE LABO EDITION. THE BED SHOULD HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED LATER. (THE WALL OF STONE BRICKS SHOULD BE THE ORIGINAL BEDSIDE BACKGROUND WALL). NOW THE TAIL OF THE BED IS FACING THE FLOOR- TO-CEILING WINDOW. AT 6 PM, STANDING ON THE BALCONY, YOU CAN SEE THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN THE COCONUT FOREST AND THE SEA, AND YOU CAN ALSO SEE WUZHI. The lights of Zhoudao are bright, which is both magnificent and elegant...

In a word, whether it is a restaurant or SPA, afternoon tea, lobby hall, or even elevator room, the design is exquisite and the experience is perfect.

Tonight's buffet is also a delicate surprise...

Not over, continue tomorrow...

Happy New Year to everyone.üçæÔ∏èüéÜ

msg:Experience the most comfortable and surprising hotel experience, and reflect the emotional value of service that a luxury hotel should have

Because I was traveling alone and casually, I drove around several hotels in Haitang Bay that I was interested in before making a decision. At the beginning, I experienced any experience of indiscriminate service as a non-hotel guest, and the whole design style also made me feel that this is the space I want to choose to relax, so I made a reservation and checked in directly.

What I remember and impress is the guest relationship Sulli, Max at Seafood Restaurant and Lily at Spa. They gave me a lot of surprises and attention. Helping me arrange activities at the hotel, make an appoin**ent for nucleic acid, sincerely ask about my experience and make any adjus**ents, which makes me very relaxed and at ease.

The experience in the edition made me give this solo trip full marks. Happy 28th birthday to myself~ and plan to bring my parents back to experience it in a few months~

The Dior joint pool is beautiful, and the cocktails at the bar by the pool are super delicious. It really has the most fashionable and cutting-edge a**osphere everywhere. Surprisingly, this hotel is also very parent-child, kayaking, children's heated swimming pool, beach seawater swimming pool, quite fun, and the two children are very happy. The service also gave me a very good feeling, especially when the Spring Festival was approaching, and the points were not deducted because of the high occupancy rate. The housekeeper Kim Xiaojin introduced very detailed and answered any questions, which can represent the hotel to give people a sense of intimacy. . At the same time, I would like to commend Yang Juzhu and Lin Qiuying, the waiters who cleaned up the room, for washing the dirty socks that my husband threw on the ground. I took a lot of favorite photos in the EDITION, and I played very well. I was really reluctant to change the hotel, and I will stay again next time!

The buyer's shop downstairs, SND, contracted all the clothes for my vacation. I bought shorts when I was hot, and a jacket when I was cold. There is Dior next to it. You don‚Äôt need to bring clothes and bags when you come to Edison for a vacation.

The children‚Äôs club also comes every day. The venue is very clean and large. Children can play for a long time. The only shortcoming is that there are no items that the teacher will bring to play.

The T-bone steak at Tianlu Restaurant is of good quality, and the truffle risotto is also delicious. In the dinner buffet, there is a hot pot with dregs of vinegar and prawns. I think it is much better than the food stalls outside.

The service here is impeccable. We will add things according to the amount every day. For example, we love to drink tea and coffee. The waitress will add a few more packets of tea and coffee liquid to us every day, and boil the water at the same time. I will leave a small note to us every day, and the meticulous service is really heartwarming.

The Sanya Editon is so beautiful and lingering...

After staying for three days, the small size slippers were not in place. The water provided is the most common among the hotels I stayed in. The most homely thing is that the drinks and snacks at the water bar are only free on the day of check-in, and the next day Start charging, a few bottles of Coke, two bags of dried fruit, as for? It also claims to be a luxury hotel, which hotel of this level in Sanya does not have free water! The seawater swimming pool advertised by his family is very shallow. This season, the water is hot like a hot spring. The Dior swimming pool and the top-floor swimming pool are both on the Internet. The bar swimming pool is very small and only adults can enter. The bamboo at the entrance of the hotel , and some plants in other locations need to be painted frequently. We stayed for three days and encountered two spray paints. It choked to death.

Stayed for three days without a handwritten note. The welcoming butler followed into the room and saw that there were children, but no tents or climbing mats for children were arranged, and there was no bathtub arrangement at all. Is it because the class I booked for a sea-view twin room is too low to be worthy of these services? I asked Lucy, the housekeeper, if we could delay check-out until 12:30. Is it half an hour short of cleaning? Since the minibar is charged, why not refill it every day when you clean it? No more after drinking. I only came here because of the good service that others said, so just give me this kind of service? Why don't I go to the Crowne Plaza next door, there are more facilities for children.

I dare say that the service of this Edison is by far the worst or even the most disgusting that I have ever seen under the domestic Marriott. Do you like to find people to write good reviews so much? A person who seldom reviews and never gives bad reviews. Ctrip's first bad review is for you Sanya Edition. In addition to taking pictures, the service of this Edison is like **** in my eyes. Is there any service at all? At that time, when I was struggling to choose Poly Rosewood or Edison, I felt that Marriott‚Äôs service was very good. Who knew that this New Year‚Äôs Eve trip really made me sick. In addition, I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because I booked with Ctrip. been targeted in various ways. Discuss one by one, every sentence is true, and all spectators can use it as one of the references.
1. My girlfriend‚Äôs birthday was on the 29th. I asked Ctrip to contact the hotel to make some basic arrangements. I arrived at the store at about 1:00 pm that day. When I arrived at the hotel lobby, the little brother came to help with the luggage. It turned out to be the only thing I felt serviced. When I checked in, all three computers could do it and there were so many people queuing up, but there were three or four staff members standing behind the two computers. It wasn‚Äôt until a customer behind me started to get angry, and a staff member came to another computer Said to check in for me, the housekeeper assigned to us was named Dany, I laughed when I read the good reviews just now, and someone actually wrote good reviews for her, there was no active service once, except for introducing where the hotel is good to take pictures and a flash mob Other than the dior store, there are only one question and one answer. There is no introduction to the activities of the New Year's Eve hotel, and there is no mention of what to do in the hotel. The beach BBQ time is never notified in advance, and the 5% discount coupon for the duty-free shop is also not available. The fact that we didn‚Äôt take the initiative to remind us to pick it up means that we should take the initiative to book one day in advance instead of asking her for these the next day. I‚Äôm sorry, but I‚Äôm too picky and embarrassing the housekeeper. I should do a good job of the strategy.
2. On the first night when I checked in, I felt a little uncomfortable and had a fever, so I reported it to the Sanya Epidemic Prevention Office. My girlfriend wanted to buy some medicine for me. Butler Dany told us that the hotel did not have the right to sell medicines and let us place the order by ourselves. I feel ok. But the second point, I don‚Äôt know if you can understand the experience of the bathroom toilet smell, and lying on the bed can smell the smell of the sewer mixed with the smell of urine‚ûï****, isn‚Äôt this disgusting me? The butler Dany said that he helped to call the guest room manager to look at it. What about the follow-up? Tell me what will happen next? In the morning, the hotel received a message from the Sanya Epidemic Prevention Office. They heard that I had a fever, so they called me after ten o'clock to check the nucleic acid situation and confirm my status. How could the call come in? The room manager can't come in when he comes to help solve the toilet sewer odor problem. Except for the fact that the hotel sent a piece of fruit and two coconuts the next day, the matter was nothing. To put it bluntly, I flushed the toilet dozens of times, and the smell gradually diminished. Finally, the hotel's bathrobes were no longer equipped after we used them on the first day. This is the service we should enjoy in the Edison.
3. On the second day of check-in, we woke up at 10 o'clock for breakfast. We wanted to have breakfast outdoors to see the scenery. After registering at the breakfast registration desk, the table next to it was just being cleaned. There was no reservation information or reservation information on the table, and The waiter was leading us to a seat. Another waiter came from the west with a foreigner and told me that it was reserved by this lady just now, and arranged another outdoor seat for us. We walked behind her for a long time. If there is no circle, he said to arrange indoors for us. My girlfriend saw that it was already 10:20, and breakfast would be over soon, so she said forget it and let's go indoors. But I really kept the anger in my heart for several days, and I endured it for a long time. I ran out and quarreled with the waiter, and I said, "I can skip breakfast today, but I want a seat outside." Sure enough, the seat came out within a minute after losing my temper, and I really wanted to say Did these waiters think it was China 100 years ago? Foreigners are **** you want to drive me away? All my statements are facts without embellishment.
4. Because of the service problem, we had no expectations for the hotel on the third day. We booked a Fengshang studio suite, and the bed was too small and uncomfortable. Another funny thing is that the balcony door cannot be opened unless it is locked. Air conditioner, the air conditioner will automatically turn off, call the guest service center, the answer is the hotel's automatic protection and energy saving mode. The simple answer is that I take a warm bath in the bathtub on the balcony. The temperature in Sanya is very cold in the morning and evening. I want to turn on the air conditioner in the house. After the bath, it will not be so cold when I enter the house. The hotel told me that I can‚Äôt take a bath outside. There is no air conditioning to preheat inside. Therefore, the hotel really has an inescapable responsibility for my cold and fever. In addition, coconut water and welcome fruit were delivered on the first day and the second day, so on the third day, I really wanted to eat raisins and my girlfriend wanted to drink coconut water, so I called the guest service center to ask when the fruit and coconut water will be delivered today. There is no need for so many varieties, only grapes and coconut water are needed. The answer from the guest service center is that there is only a welcome gift on the first day, and there will be no later ones. But obviously you gave it away the next day, can I afford two coconuts and fruit? It's just that I have to use the reason to fool the customer even if I refuse, I really want to be rude.
5. My girlfriend and I returned to the room at 11:55 on New Year‚Äôs Eve, and wanted to go to the mini bar to open a bottle of red wine on the hour, but there was no red wineüç∑, ok, so we thought about opening beerüçª, but there was no beer opener , Called the guest service center and said to arrange someone to deliver it, I said no, it was past zero when it was delivered. At the end of the new year, my girlfriend said that my stomach hurts. It should be because we ate seafood at night and I couldn‚Äôt adapt. I called the guest service center again and asked for a late check-out. I applied until 12:30, do you mean that I didn't use the official app to subscribe, so I can't enjoy the membership benefits? I immediately contacted Ctrip's customer service and asked Ctrip's customer service to negotiate. In the end, we ended up checking out at three o'clock. So I really suspect that Edison is here to disgust me on purpose. There is no active service at all. What do I say about passive service?
Finally, to make a summary, the executives of Edison in the province thought I was a colleague who deliberately made a bad review. I'm just a customer who simply wants to accompany my girlfriend to celebrate her birthday and New Year's Eve. I was kicked off by Sanya Edison for three days, and I didn't enjoy myself at all. The hotel's toiletries are good, and the aunt will leave a small note after cleaning every day. It is also possible to take pictures in the hotel, so all the publicity of the hotel is a holy place for online celebrity check-in, and it is also relying on taking pictures to attract customers to come to check-in, so I don't care how the service is doing at all. The service of the housekeeper and the entire hotel is in my favor It seems that the active service index is zero, and the passive service is like squeezing toothpaste. The original intention of hotel service is to make customers give up their demands and resolutely not add any burden to our work. The purpose of hotel service is to hope for more Customers can not bother our hotel's executive housekeepers and waiters. I am also engaged in the service industry. I really don‚Äôt know if Edison, such a big brand, has its own set of management procedures and service rules and regulations. If you come to Sanya, I really don‚Äôt recommend the Edison. The price/performance ratio is extremely low. If you say that I just need to take a photo and check in, I think it‚Äôs OK. If you want to experience the service in the Edison, it‚Äôs just a dream.

[Beach] Very good, relatively gentle, very suitable for digging sand with small pots. recommend.
[Children's playground] Yes, there are more toys and activities. Children will be given small toys when they check in. Children will be happier.
[Swimming pool] It‚Äôs very awesome, divided into a human area and a children‚Äôs area. The adult area is an infinity pool design, which is very cool. The children's area is divided into shallow water area and deep water area. It is suitable for children of different ages and situations to play. Children's swimming rings and towels are provided for free. The service is still very good.
[Room] Too simple design does not meet the basic needs of accommodation, such as no place to hang towels, bath towels, and no place to hang some small underwear. For guests with children, the double bed room is not recommended, because there is only a gauze curtain between the washing area and the double bed. If the adult gets up, it will affect the child's sleep. In addition, children really have no place to hang socks for washing clothes, and there is a clothes rail on the balcony, but in this season, they really can‚Äôt dry a pair of socks for 3 days. In addition, the opposite of our room is the Crowne Plaza, which feels a bit close. Pay attention to privacy. Pull up the curtains in the room and say goodbye to the sea view.
[Butler service] There are a lot of hotels in Sanya. The butler service of the Addison is really average, except that we asked for more mineral water to make milk powder for the children, and there is no welcome fruit.
The above personal feelings are for your reference.

There is a lot of space inside. There are a lot of fun activities for parents and children. There is a large seawater swimming pool. There is a seawater lake next to the pool. There are many sea fishes swimming in it and can be fed at any time. A large area of beach sand with fine white waves can follow the waves. A large area of coconut groves can walk slowly along the tree-lined trails. There are many dining options to choose your own taste. I especially like the Chinese food recommended by Baron called Xianhai Restaurant. The dishes are very delicious and there is Michelin. Excellent taste and taste. The waiters are particularly attentive, and the sky pool on the 12th floor is very cool.

Service: From the doorway to the layout of the house, a dany beauty housekeeper has been careful to tell us how to get to the hotel facilities, leisure area and breakfast. How convenient is it? I don‚Äôt actually go to the duty-free shop, but I also very intimately asked if I did. No need, I said I want to buy Victoria's Secret items and help me search for them. I was really touched and liked her
Sanya: It‚Äôs really worth staying in Sanya. Every time I go back to the hotel, my clothes are folded upright. Seeing that I used the shower gel, I sent a bunch of them the next day.
Breakfast: To tell the truth, there is really nothing to eat for breakfast. The recommended one is egg rolls. My husband said that it is the same as the one eaten in the United States.
Let‚Äôs say no. There are a total of five dishes. One meat dish is not all seasonal vegetables. It makes me carnivorous too uncomfortable. Secondly, the spicy stir-fried seafood dish is quite speechless. There are not many vegetables in the salad area and more than 20. The kind of sauce is actually a bit fancy, there is no real thing
Overall it‚Äôs not bad. The service of such a big hotel can also keep up, like Poly Majestic and Intercontinental service. It‚Äôs really incomparable with the Edison. There is nothing to eat after living for a long time~
Hotel entertainment is very fun: there are many boats to play, kayaks, a family of three can also take a boat tour of the lake, and fish can be fed by the children, fish food is free, the swimming pool is very good and very large.
I look forward to coming to Sanya next time I will bring my brother and my baby to live, the experience is very good~ I hope to continue

üßπHygienic: Clean and clean, and room service will be cleaned every day. If necessary, you can call the customer service center in time.
üçÉEnvironment: The Sanya Edition Hotel, which is known as the ceiling, is full of check-in places. There is no unbeautiful place, but the moment of discovering beauty is lacking. From the resting place on both sides of the lobby to the beach, there is no place that is not suitable for taking pictures.
üîîService: The experience in Addison is not just the majority of people conquered by her hardware. More is her service. Home away from home I think it is a more appropriate description of the service of the butler Nina. Miss Nina is anxious for the guests' urgency and thinks about what the guests think. As a newcomer, I checked in earlier that day. As the hotel meets the needs of most guests to the greatest extent, because I checked out until nearly three o‚Äôclock when I checked out, I checked out when I checked out and cleaned up. Checking in will put a huge pressure on the staff who clean the room. There were no vacancies in the room when I came. Despite this, Miss Nina updated the room status in real time and notified me if there was a vacancy, and took me to the room to settle me down. See the details: when I entered the room, the welcome gift was already placed, and this detail was warmed up. I am also very grateful to Kayle who gave me timely answers when I first called. Thanks again to Nina for the service provided during my stay.
There is a little bit to complain about, and the ultimate service is not allowed to be dragged down. Flaws: First of all, the hotel‚Äôs minibar is actually charged, which is very unhappy. There is also a neck pain that looks twisted in this position of the TV in the fashion studio suite. Finally, the elevator indicator light on the ninth floor near the corridor did not light up, which caused many missed elevators.
Barbecue bar‚Äôs barbecue has nothing to say about the taste, Malaysian flavor, but the set meal is too much, I can‚Äôt finish it, I can‚Äôt finish packing it, and I wasted it in the end. Pity. I hope that the hotel will set a reasonable price for the package, and the portion will be more appropriate. The hotel embodies the concept of environmental protection everywhere.
A wonderful experience in Addison ended successfully

The location is good, right next to the duty-free shop.
The butler, Miss Dany, is very considerate. From reception to check-in, she also introduced us to the hotel‚Äôs infrastructure and room details, and is always online to help solve all problems.
By the way: all the toiletries in the hotel are le labo! good job! Ha ha

The a**osphere was full and everything was arranged very well. The whole hotel is full of the taste of le labo, I like it very much, the environment is comfortable, and the privacy is high. The room has no exaggerated and redundant decoration, but it does not lose the sense of design, which is also very satisfactory. I didn't go out for a few days in Sanya, so I just took a break in the hotel and enjoyed the rare slow time. There are places where I can sit and lie down in a daze. Anyway, come next time~

The design of the entire hotel is young and stylish, emphasizing the privacy of the individual staying space. The hotel rooms are simple, transparent, quiet, clean and free of odors. Check into the hotel on the first day Fresh coconut water was prepared intimately. It is worth mentioning that when checking in at the front desk, the hotel will have guest relations staff actively request to add WeChat. There is no excessive marketing during the whole service process, and there will be questions and answers for guests‚Äô inquiries and reasonable requests. , I will also send WeChat every day to inquire about the experience of staying in. Thank you for the careful arrangement of the guest relationship Mia. I highly recommend the breakfast at this hotel. The breakfast is rich in variety, including sweet, sour, spicy, Chinese and Western styles. It is considered the best breakfast hotel for this trip to Hainan. Let me just say that the management of this hotel is also very formal. If you want to travel in the hotel, you need to sign a hotel shooting agreement at the front desk. The content of the shooting agreement basically requires that the shooting does not disturb the guests. It is strongly recommended that everyone stay in this hotel. Taking a silhouette photo is really beautiful. Generally speaking, it is a very young and fashionable hotel. I am satisfied

On the way to the airport, I'm still reviewing with my boyfriend
The Sanya Edition service is really nothing to say. I am very worried that Haitang Bay will lack a sense of vacation, but from the moment I got off the bus and arrived, this service really moved me.
Thanks again to Miss Skylar for being so patient and very careful!
After checking in, I pulled a WeChat group, and talked about anything in the group for your consideration.
All our needs are fulfilled
Then Figure 3.4, is the data cable for us to tidy up the room, it's so cute.! I didn't find where our charger is at the beginning hahahaha
Then be sure to recommend the panna cotta in picture 2! !
We ate at the restaurant outside and ordered takeaway, which is totally incomparable to the hotel~
I ordered one first, which was super delicious, and then immediately called two more and one with my boyfriend~~ It was really delicious! The milk tastes so strong! !
Then there is a barbecue restaurant which is also very good~ BBQ a**osphere is full~ and singing is very romantic!
The first night we ate was Tianlu, too! There are too many seafood set meals... Let‚Äôs eat directly by the wall~~
So is the spa! Super beautiful Picture 8.9 ~ Make an appoin**ent in advance to have a bath!
We didn‚Äôt have an appoin**ent so we didn‚Äôt have time to change the water, so we just had a massage~
Anyway, it‚Äôs really conscience to recommend everyone to choose edition
I am so satisfied with this vacation! ! real! ! !
Completely refresh my understanding of Sanya‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
Thanks again to Miss Skylar~ I look forward to seeing you next timeüíóüíó

msg:This is a very enjoyable trip, we immediately booked the itinerary for returning to live in January.
1) Butler Andy is always online, answering and providing help
2) What is very rare in a hotel is that every staff member can smile for you. It is very rare that the staff can call out our names during breakfast and dinner. The feeling of being pampered and cared for is hard to come by. Like to go out to play before the epidemic, just to eat this feeling of being pampered. This time I came to Addison to find this feeling. Make a spa like a soul
3) Go to the gym in the morning, let's talk about the details. The young lady in the gym gently disinfects the equipment and quietly pays attention to each guest. I was thirsty when I pushed the barbell. I turned my head and saw that a bottle of water was quietly placed in the corner. It‚Äôs like being cared about quietly
4) The meaning of travel is to discover the truth, goodness and beauty, to be treated kindly, and to reward yourself a little. Addison can really make you feel pampered.
5) This time, thanks to the little brother who had breakfast, the little brother in the swimming pool, and the cara who barbecued on the beach... and the front office manager, each of them made us particularly meaningful this weekend. People especially need this kind of care, even if it is a hotel, even if it is what they should do. As a traveler, we feel that life is worthwhile from a trip. Is this the meaning of travel?

It‚Äôs a good experience for those who want to feel the sea but don‚Äôt want to go to the sea.

Esther went from check-in to check-in. The shops are very kind. They take the initiative to introduce the hotel to the room. They are kind but not greasy at all, and they won‚Äôt make you feel that they are all polite. The Ritz service is very good but the social emotional intelligence is better than the Edison Ritz is okay.
Disadvantages: the breakfast is too simple, and the taste is not very good...not quite matching
And because it is an Internet celebrity hotel, there are really too many Internet celebrities, so I don‚Äôt feel like going on vacation. I feel like dining in an Internet celebrity restaurant in the city. For example, there are people using flash photography everywhere in the bar. Dj is very lonely hahahaha.
In short, it is recommended to come and experience it.

And vikki in the catering reservation depar**ent knew that we had brought the baby üë∂üèª actually prepared a thermostat for making milk powder for the baby! You are so sweet! Thank you very much for your service!
Overall I feel that the Edison in Haitang Bay is a perfect resort hotel worth visiting again! Conscience recommendation!

My husband said that the set meal for two is better than the one I went out to eat. Thanks to Esther for his warm service. , A very good little sister, she was introduced during the check-in process. She was very heart-warming and the arrangements were great. Next time, she will still choose Edison, the best choice in Sanya.

msg:The hotel is really out of the picture, the kind that has a scene just three meters away. Recently, there are relatively few people in Sanya, it is particularly comfortable and the weather is good. What is more surprising is the wine and afternoon tea at the Starry Sky Bar. Not only are they good-looking, they are also very delicious.

The service is also very good. From check-in to check-out, there is a butler one-to-one service. Sister Esther is very kind. There are questions and answers on WeChat, which solves many of our confusions during our stayü•∞

In addition, my wife likes the Le Labo accessories used by Edison. The taste is very good, and the shampoo and conditioner are also very useful. I brought Kashy hair mask and I didn‚Äôt use it ü§ì

The hotel is really beautiful, like a botanical garden, where you can eat and wander all day long. It is the staycation I have been looking forward to for a long time! Great satisfaction....

I was very tired when I first arrived at the hotel, but I was swept away by Nina with a warm smile and service. I immediately helped prepare coconut fruits, protective suits, playpens, and super cute baby suits. After swimming the next day, I suddenly found coconut and cake rolls in the room. It turned out that Nina went to the hotel to get her place. I went to help with the reservation. I was so touched, so sweet. The baby happened to be hungry and loved to eat. When I left, Nina and Noarh also helped to delay the check-out. Just talk about it. Noarh also helped delay the delay for another half an hour. , I don‚Äôt dare to have time if I feel that I have plenty of time. Addison is such a good facility and location with such excellent staff. In the future, I must bring my baby to stay at Edison at least once a year. I am very happy. Thank you Nina and Noarh.

The design is indeed unique, and the ambient music is also very distinctive. The fly in the oin**ent is that the opening hours of the freshwater swimming pool are not clear. The music rang from 7 am to 8 am, and there was no staff. I called the front desk to find someone to send towels, and the front desk also agreed to be unhappy. There is not even a separate changing room by the pool. The toilet next to the breakfast restaurant was not clean. All of them are owned by the Marriott Group, and I feel that the maintenance and service of the Ritz-Carlton's facilities are at a better level.

Booked the Sanya Edition Hotel with anticipation
This is the second time I have come to Sanya Addison~~~

This time it was because I saw the dior joint name and pop-up store in the hotel poolüòù
After a busy life, you can take pictures and stroll around on a vacation
But! ! !
The pool sticker is removed, leaving the lounge chair and sofa cover next to the pool.

#

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ü•≤

I didn‚Äôt visit the whole hotel for the first time, but I walked all over this time
There are two or three buyer shops in the hotel. Many trendy brands can be purchased from Sanya Duty Free. In addition, some brands in buyer shops have discounts. Peng friends who like trendy brands are worth visiting.

#

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is also an art exhibition like a library. The external hard decorations are very beautiful when you take a shot. It is like a circle of art exhibitions in the hotel.

#

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Walking deep into the hotel is the beach. This time in August, I went to the sun to kill people. The sun was so hot. I looked at the sunlit beach and took a few pictures. Go back to the cool air conditioner.

#

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's talk about the hotel
This time I booked: Fashion Suite (126 square meters) üí∞5466
All balconies No bathtub outside the balcony There is a bathtub in the bathroom
There is a WeChat and a small butler, free drinks and desserts and fruits delivered to the room in the evening, the butler Colin is very intimate ‚ù§Ô∏è
There is a shuttle bus in the hotel. The call car service is very convenient whether you are going out to visit the hotel. The experience is much better than when I first came.

I remember that the hotel has a 5% discount for a duty-free shop
There are also some set hotel activities to the schedule
It‚Äôs too hot, take a vacation with peace of mind, everyone can experience it

üôàI can't finish sending photos in 9 squares

Go to a place where you can sit, but no one cares. Then I went to the swimming pool to play, and I saw a cigarette butt and a glass of medicine on the edge of the chair by the pool. Judging from this situation, I should have been lying there for a long time.

I especially believe that he introduced hotel-related matters including children's parent-child play projects. The happiest thing is to help with late check-out after knowing our situation at the end, thank you very much! Looking at the guest room evaluation before you come, you may think that the living environment is a bit simpler, but after moving in, I still prefer the decoration environment. Sometimes simplicity also has its simple beauty and texture. Although it is a little far away from the sea, of course I did not go to the seaside when I came from Yalong Bay, but it is really comfortable if the quilt is a little farther away from the sea, and the double bed is 1.5 meters in size, which is great for family trips! I need to call the beef noodles for breakfast, and Jin restaurant for dinner is also good, and I will come next time!

The reason is simple: the price-performance ratio is far better than Atlantis, and the software service also surpasses Yanlord Crown. The main hotels are basically very good at any angle. Although I took a few pictures with the baby in the end, no one helped me take a few photos, but It does not prevent me from feeling its beauty with my heart! Finally, like the housekeeper Willa, Renmei's service is good, and she will actively contact me every day to ask if she needs to arrange the day's itinerary. The hotel toiletries are from the perfume laboratory, like one! Because the elders in the family drink a lot every day, I asked the hotel to put a few more bottles of water, and then they arranged a whole box for me directly, it really has the style of a big hotel! In addition, the baby products arranged are also very rich! I see that many friends who are considering staying will care about the daily breakfast. There are more than 200, but it is worth the price. The juice can be freshly squeezed, and there are many kinds of milk. The dessert package should not be finished... There is also a sample Passion fruit stewed eggs, the taste is quite nice, picky eaters ate three! In general, this hotel is recommended for friends with affluent budget, it should be cheaper after the summer! Finally, the Dior pop-up store in the hotel will end at the end of August~~~

For activities, Kim also booked a western restaurant for us on the last night and took us on the bus and left. Children also have fun in the hotel, feeding fish and swimming, renting life buoys and sand dredging tools everywhere, as well as various activities in kids club. You will not be boring at all without going out. The pool bubble bath is the children's favorite. Will definitely recommend friends~

First of all, from the beginning of the service, the service staff will come to guide you as soon as you get off the car, and the scale of enthusiasm is well grasped, which makes people feel very sincere, especially after the check-in, the Colin service butler is very good! It can help us solve many problems at any time, including ordinary service personnel, which makes people truly experience "home away from home". The scenery, the picture was taken directly by myself with my mobile phone. There is no P picture yet. The beauty is a mess. I took the child to catch a crab on the beach and found a hermit crab and a jellyfish. Hahaha üòÑ, the child is very happy. Location, very close to the duty-free shop, next door is Crown, Westin, Atlantis, 35 minutes drive from the airport, very convenient, mainly because the water is transparent! Too much, very satisfied with the stay! Five-star recommendation! ! ! Thanks again Colin to all the staff of the hotelüëçüëçüëç

WeChat contact. You must answer your questions in seconds. Because I didn‚Äôt sleep well the next day. Dizziness and request for late check-out was readily agreed.

Don‚Äôt be afraid to make a mistake, you can go to eat other things when the time comes. This is also great There will be Dior in mid-August.

The whole hotel is a fashionable place: a large area of artificial inner sea, starry sky, Dior pop-up store, Dior swimming pool...Of course it has these, and it can only be said to be a beautiful resort hotel, but, In Addison, we also experienced a very perfect service: the butler Nina is a kind little beauty, her company makes our vacation always feel warm and considerate: since we first arrived at the hotel, she I began to work hard to help us solve the problem. I heard that we were going to shoot in a hotel. Under the premise that the room was very tight, we upgraded a room with a more beautiful sea view. I sent green coconuts and fruits to our room. When we asked for a later check-out, we tried our best to help us solve the problem. The experience of staying in is super good, and I will choose Edison next time.

Frankly speaking, the Addison‚Äôs experience really gave me a big surprise, much better than the other internet celebrities, no matter it is Customer experience officer Andy and Li Xuemei of room service are very attentive and in place. From the day before check-in, the pick-up car was a Mercedes-Benz commercial vehicle. The baby who was motion sick did not feel any uncomfortable feelings. After arriving at the hotel, the hotel experience officer Andy was waiting at the door early, and thoughtfully took us to the room, completed the check-in in the room, and continued to contact and care about our needs for a few days after staying in. The convenience note that Xuemei, the waiter who cleans the room, left a message every day was even more heartwarming. Will continue to stay in the future, the hotel environment is good, the service is also very good, breakfast, dinner and room service catering are very high-level, exquisite and delicious. As a hotel controller, I am very satisfied with the staying experience of Addison this time. I will continue to stay in the future and bring the company's employees to team building. I hope that Addison can continue to work hard to maintain such a high-quality service level.

By coincidence, I added the WeChat of the two butlers, Colin and Denise, and took the initiative to replace the hard bed and buckwheat pillows for me, so that I can have enough quality sleep. I really appreciate the care I have received in the past few days. There are a lot of controversies about the design style of the Edison room on the Internet. This varies from person to person. Personally speaking, this minimalist and indifferent style fits my aesthetics, and I am very happy. Finally, I would like to thank the hotel for adding a lot of good memories to my vacation trip. If I come to Sanya again, I will still choose to stay.

Our personal butler is Willa (Guest Relations Depar**ent), who will accompany us throughout the check-in process and send us back to our room. The guests have a sense of belonging. Because it is a honeymoon trip, Willa arranged the room in advance and presented honeymoon cakes, fruit plates, and two coconuts, which was very considerate. We live in 601 and the sight is great.

The style of the entire hotel is very minimal. The lobby is a must-have bamboo screen, catching up with the Dior pop-up store. The soft decoration of the entire hotel is Dior style. The standard swimming pool (Dior swimming pool) and the top-floor swimming pool are very suitable for taking pictures. Yes, the beach barbecue needs to be reserved in advance. The lobster set meal ordered is sufficient and tastes very good, and there are foreign resident singers. The hotel‚Äôs breakfast is rich in variety, which can satisfy the tastes of different people.

msg:As a new Internet celebrity hotel in Haitang Bay, Edition has first-class public space and services, and several restaurants are also very good. Jin's simple breakfast and evening buffet are very rich, and the standard of pastry is also good. Even in Shanghai, Tianlu is a great Mediterranean restaurant. But the guest room is a bit emm. I want to say that simple design style does not mean that it is simple and good. I joked that it is the standard of the all-season or Atour wooden room with sea view balcony. It is disappointing to change from Capella.

msg:I stayed at the Ritz-Carlton for 4 nights. I was about to leave, but I changed my flight and stayed in the Edison. To be honest, the decoration of the hotel is pretty good. It‚Äôs the so-called good service. I really didn‚Äôt realize it. Because I have to catch a plane in the morning, I asked to pack a cup of coffee in the restaurant. I was told that I could only drink it in the restaurant and could not take it away. In the end, I had to buy a cup by myself. I asked to pack the drink I bought when I checked out. I was told that there was no way to get it. As a result, I had to use the Ritz-Carlton box to carry it to the airport to pack it. As a high-end brand of Marriott, to be honest, Edison still has to learn from Ritz. The so-called Internet celebrity check-in hotel is not just for Internet celebrities bring photo effects, more importantly, to help and solve the needs of customers
