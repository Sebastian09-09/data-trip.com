msg:The location is okay, its quite dark at night not suitable to walk down to the street area. 

The service of the front desk wasn‚Äôt very good, we are in the line waiting for our turn to check in. Instead of doing ours, they check in for the guest (believe they are Chinese resident). 

The breakfast was ok, nothing fabulous.

The room is big and comfy, however we heard dog barking on second night thinking it was stray dog nearby. However, the dog was in the door next to ours.  The policy on the hotel showing pet not allow not sure how the guest bought the pet up without them knowing.

msg:As a foreigner staying in Sanya, I‚Äôd highly recommend the Four Seasons. The rooms are huge and clean, nothing beats a bathtub on the balcony overlooking great views of downtown Sanya. The staff was incredibly helpful and they always went out of the way to help me if it was knowing where to go, hailing a taxi or even getting tickets to events. The breakfast was both western and eastern to appease everybody, buffet style so it was a good buy. The location is central and a short walk to Dadonghai beach area. Yalong Bay is a 15-20 minute taxi ride away. Overall, this was a great experience and I‚Äôd highly recommend it.

The room has no fridge but one can be requested, ice is an issue as they only will give you a bag saying their ice machine is too small as an excuse. The staff at the hotel are clueless, nobody knows how to do anything and give you attitude, very disrespectful, difficult to deal with and infuriating. Had our breakfast table cleaned when we went to the bathroom including our personal belongings and room key, when staff couldn‚Äôt locate our belongings we found them after we dug around in the rubbish. Horrible experience overall. My wife was not so impressed with her birthday getaway to say the least.

The hotel signs are not super clear.

The room I took had a hottub outsid,  which would have been great if not for it facing another hotel, so zero privacy outside.

The bathroom could have been cleaned better to get rid of mold.

The doors in room were not closing properly.

The gym advertised was not what was available. It barely had 4 pieces of equipment in total.

The pool was not clean or inviting. They said the pool temp was warm but when feeling the water it was not.

The area around the pool made it look deserted and unwelcoming.

The room was fine, very big with an amazing bathtub on the balcony! But the bathroom was really not that good: the shower‚Äôs and toilet‚Äôs doors couldn‚Äôt be closed properly so the water was everywhere and the curtain was unimaginably dirty!
Breakfast options are very poor. There is a road nearby with a heavy traffic so if you are a light sleeper, keep it in mind!
Overall, if you are traveling on budget it‚Äôs ok. The seaside is around 10 minutes on foot and the view from the balcony is amazing!

I have stayed at this hotel multiple times, and each stay has been wonderful. Whenever I visit Sanya, this hotel is always on my list. 

The check-in process is smooth, the rooms are cozy and comfortable, and the balcony offers stunning panoramic views where you can enjoy beautiful sunsets. 

One of the highlights of staying here is the breathtaking infinity pool, absolutely love the views! Additionally, the hotel provides a small playground for kids and a fish pool.

I definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable stay in Sanya.

msg:My room smelled of mold.  After telling the hotel staff (with the help of an app as nobody speaks English), they just asked the housekeeper to open my window.  Result: the room still smelled musty but in addition there were mosquitoes... The whole hotel is not very clean.  It must have been a nice hotel several years ago, but it is clearly outdated.  The breakfast is very very average. Do not expect to try anything good or original. In short, I do not recommend it to anyone.  Not even to my enemies. For a few yuan more, there are much better hotels in this city.

msg:Shocking. Not a real 4 seasons at all. Not the class ones that I‚Äôve experienced all over the world. No room service, no fridge, no mini-bar, wasn‚Äôt even told that my room included breakfast (which was not a good breakfast) until well into my stay. The hot tub on the balcony was a major selling point but it was just lukewarm - not hot and they couldn‚Äôt fix it. Broken lights in the room that were not fixed. Worst and most disappointing thing was that my AirPods were taken from my locked room on the last night of my stay. I had taken them out of the safe and put them in my carry on bag in a specific place - ready for my early flight in the morning. When I got back to the hotel, they were gone. Sad and stupid of me as I also had AirPods taken from my hotel room in HouHai bay on a previous trip! Very disappointing. The mood and ambience of the hotel was dour, uneasy and fractious. Note to self: start buying big headphones and never take them off! One of the receptionists was quite nice and spoke decent English but most of the staff could not speak English (understandable) and looked like they did not want to be there.

msg:Great hotel, clean and hygienic, warm service, long history.
The hotel was designed by a famous Thai designer and has a Southeast Asian style. It has double sea views and mountain and river views, which is very suitable for sitting on the mountain and watching the sea. The hotel also has a large underground parking lot and Shunjing Food Street. It also has high-end special supporting facilities such as sightseeing elevators and swimming pools. It provides guests with regional boutique dishes including Hainan local dishes, special Sichuan cuisine, boutique Western pastries, noodles, and open stalls such as wine bars and first-class service experience.
The hotel is very close to the city and the beach. It is convenient for playing and suitable for living. I have been to Sanya many times before, stayed in Hilton and Haitang Bay, but only this hotel made me linger. It is really an honor that while staying in the hotel, I also learned about the history of the hotel and the charm of the city of Sanya.

Skip the expense of a bathtub cover.

So I searched around on Ctrip and booked this hotel. The price of just over 300 yuan was well worth it. Yes, because we had a flight in the morning, we checked in at the front desk as soon as we arrived at the hotel. The service was great. My brother saw that he had children with him, so he even offered to upgrade them to a themed parent-child room for free. The room was clean and tidy, and the children loved it. It has a blue ocean animal theme, and the room also has some slides and tents for children to play on. There are swings and other arrangements, and a large bathtub on the balcony. On the first day, I played in the room all afternoon and didn't want to go until dinner. After breakfast, the public facilities next to it are a children's swimming pool, a children's playground, and a fish spa pool. The environment Very comfortable.

First of all, the environment is the natural scenery for leisure vacation. The location is in the Dadonghai business district and close to the city center. The transportation is very convenient whether it is going to scenic spots or the night market in the city. Secondly, the service: five-star standard and seven-star service staff have a particularly high sense of service. From the moment I got off the bus and the doorman took the initiative to pick up my luggage to the time I checked in at the front desk, I felt warm and friendly. When I checked in, the girl at the front desk was very attentive when she saw that I had children with me and adjusted a parent-child room. The room was very spacious when I opened it. I consider myself a mysophobic person, but the rooms in this hotel are hygienic. At first glance, it is clean and tidy. There are children's facilities in the room, slides and swings, and a large bathtub on the balcony. Children can play all day without wanting to go out. There is also an open-air swimming pool with a fish spa next to the swimming pool. There are quite a lot of people there. For breakfast, there are Hainan specialty snacks and various powders to refresh and cool down. The important thing is that many hotels in Sanya do not have breakfast hours until 13:30. That is good news for lazy bed bugs, haha. A very satisfying trip. I will definitely come again next time. I hope it will be as good as ever.

Facilities: The paint is peeling off the door. There is no big mirror in the bathroom of the executive suite. There is one in the living room. There is a bathroom at the entrance and a bathroom inside. But there should be a clothes hanger here when you enter. The wardrobe is at the back. The most speechless thing is that there is a balcony.

Environment: The lobby is magnificent, the courtyard is filled with birdsong and flowers, and the inside of the room is just like what you imagine in old Shanghai.

One-day trip on a two-person luxury yacht to the sea: a low-end package for tour groups, just to find people to go with. You can only sit on the first floor. Going to the second and third floors ranges from 150/200 per person. The boat is dirty and messy. The yacht you imagined is completely different, and the hotel doesn't care, so you can call the travel agency yourself.
Sinopharm Zhongfu Duty Free Shop 130 yuan no-threshold voucher (need to have an out-of-island air ticket): Didn‚Äôt go
Family and parent-child travel photography: The writing is free. I called and said that I would go to work on the ninth day of the ***** New Year, so it cost 100 yuan. In Sanya, you told me that I would only go to work on the ninth day of the ***** New Year? ! Can you also explain the reason for this kind of charging? !
The only thing I use is the Qingqin Fish Spa, which is quite comfortable and is next to the swimming pool.

I stayed in a five-star hotel for two days. The first day was 1680 and the second day was 1100. I planned to book 919 on the third day simply because I was too lazy to move. After dinner, the room became 1200+, so I decided to change. Well, coming from Shanghai, I really can‚Äôt believe this is a five-star hotel. It‚Äôs three stars, just qualified. It can‚Äôt cost more than 500 yuan a day! ! !

His family checked out at 12 o'clock and checked in at 3 o'clock. I arrived around 2:30, and it turned out that it would take 40 minutes to clean up the room, which means that I couldn't check in at 3 o'clock. , it was said that there were only two aunts cleaning on the first floor, and we were two children, and they were over 1.2 meters tall and under 1.4 meters in half price. I asked if I could get a breakfast, but he said he was not a boss, so in the morning we spent another 49 yuan to buy one. Half-price meal, 49 for breakfast. You can weigh it yourself. If you eat from morning to afternoon, it's worth it, but it's really not. Apart from these, I really recommend it.

It is more than 10 minutes' walk from the seaside. The breakfast at the hotel is really good. Breakfast and Chinese food are combined together, so it's great You don't have to get up so early and can sleep until you wake up naturally. Overall, I am very satisfied with the hotel and it was a very pleasant trip.

msg:It is very suitable for the first stop in Sanya after the plane lands. Go directly (or Luhuitou early the next morning)

The brunch is great, with rich dishes, and the brunch buffet closes at 1:30 noon, which is so considerate! And the open-air restaurant is great too!

Environment: Built on the mountain, the view is ideal. It is very close to Luhuitou Park. It is convenient to take a taxi and can be reached directly by bus No. 26 (especially if there is a traffic jam on the return trip to the scenic spot and it is difficult to get a taxi, it is too good). There are a lot of places to eat in the walking distance around.

Service: Very attentive. I booked a night view room very early. I was specially upgraded to a suite. The room is huge and the view is great. I was also given a late check-out until two o'clock.

As for the shortcomings, it is that it has been open for a long time, and some of the small details in the houses are a little outdated.

msg:The hotel's breakfast time is very long until 1:30 noon. The disadvantage is that the taste is just okay. The milk and soy milk are powdered, which is barely acceptable. There is no breakfast shop nearby, so it is recommended to order breakfast included. Although the hotel facilities are old, they are still very clean. There is a large bathtub on the balcony where you can take a bath. Please note that the balcony is not sealed, so you can only bathe at night. The floor cleaning staff will clean the room every day. The cleaning ladies No. 16 and 18 All very good. We are traveling as a family and have booked three rooms in total with a deposit of 500. When we checked in, we were told that we would upgrade the room, but the upgraded room would be in a very remote location and it would be a long walk out of the elevator. Because of the issue of changing rooms, I had to contact the front desk. It‚Äôs a bit unpleasant ‚òπÔ∏è. I feel that most of the front desk staff are very good. Some of them have poor service awareness. When you go out to play, a little bit of unpleasantness will affect your mood, so everyone still needs to be mentally prepared. The bedrooms are similar to those provided by the hotel (not shown in the picture). The main difference between the hotel rooms is the window view. By the way, the hotel is facing the road, so it will be a bit noisy at night, and even more noisy during the day. If you find it difficult to fall asleep due to the noise, you will definitely not be able to sleep well.

msg:The main thing is that the room has a musty smell. If you don't mind, everything else is very good. The breakfast is also very rich. The pool is really great. There is a lot of space on the balcony. The water in the bathroom is slow. After taking a shower, the entire area is wet. There are no disposable slippers, and they say they are used up. How should I explain this? I don‚Äôt want to be too pretentious. The bathtub cover is 15 yuan a piece, which is almost 600 yuan a night. This price is nothing in Sanya, and there are all kinds of supporting facilities. It's also quite satisfactory.

The farmhouse stir-fried private dishes in the hotel's Chinese restaurant are delicious, affordable, the ingredients are fresh, and the boss and waiters are very enthusiastic. The hotel is also equipped with a small fish pool and swimming pool for guests. Before leaving, I found hotel employees passing by in the hotel yard consciously picking up fallen leaves to maintain the hotel environment. I suddenly felt that the reason why this hotel does well in all aspects is entirely due to the hotel management, the company's employee training, and the corporate culture. Well done, it shows that the employees of the company are of high quality. Thank you to all the hotel staff! You have worked hard! If I come to Sanya again, I will choose Four Seasons Haiting Hotel!

I came in with my suitcase. There was no doorman to help me carry it. I just watched me carry my luggage by myself. After checking in, I asked how to get to the guest room. The front desk pointed to the elevator. You took me to the elevator. Is it difficult? ? ? ? I ordered takeout and informed that I was not feeling well. They did not let the takeaway person in and the hotel staff did not allow me to deliver it. I was forced to pick it up myself. The front desk said that it was over because I was afraid of being caught by the manager. I really accepted it. Does your hotel still punish the manager for serving the guests? ? ? ? At three o'clock in the middle of the night, the room was full of mosquitoes and there was no toilet water. The front desk asked me to go to the hotel front desk to get the essential oil! A five-diamond hotel with more than 200 rooms does not even have a waiter on duty. I suggest everyone choose to stay in a smart hotel or choose a hotel with good service. Check-in was too bad. It took 20 minutes and the hotel front desk sent it to me because I didn't have a good rest at night. The next day All trips have been delayed! ! ! !

The facilities and equipment are well maintained. The room layout is also antique and stylish in Chinese style. I like to take pictures and check in.

I slept until four or five o'clock in the morning and was woken up by the air conditioner. I couldn't sleep with the noise and checked out early.
The hotel deposit refund was also very slow. I called the front desk to ask for the refund. All in all, it was a very disappointing stay. The price is cheap and I don‚Äôt ask for much, but at least I have to be able to sleep. I was woken up even if I slept the most basic way. Checked in.

Seeing that there are children there, she even offers breakfast as a gift. That's great, isn't the hotel manager? Hahaha, I made a return visit at night to see if there is anything that can be improved. If it is not so hot, the room can be ventilated more. Yes, the room is very air-conditioned in August, thumbs up. The swimming waiter by the tourist pool is very nice and humorous, but unfortunately the time is a bit short.

It is quite worthwhile to go out on the yacht provided by the hotel. You can go out at 9 am and come back at 2 pm. The free thing is that you can only stay on the enclosed first floor of the yacht and have four simple meals for lunch. For an additional 200 yuan, you can have a meal on the yacht. A seafood dinner with 9 dishes, drinks and fruits, you can wander around on the second and third floors of the yacht, and you will also get a motorboat experience.

The bathroom is separated from the shower and toilet, and the bathtub is on the balcony, which is very convenient to use and the design is particularly reasonable. When I first came here, I stayed in a standard room facing the mountain. It was very large and very quiet. It was very comfortable to take a bath and look at the mountain. If the parent-child room does not face the mountain, the second floor faces the road and the yacht. I thought it would be noisy, but I didn't expect it to be very quiet. It feels like soundproof glass has been replaced. (When I checked in for the first time, I arrived at the hotel at midnight on the first day and was given a room facing the road. It felt like sleeping on the street. Because of the noise, I changed to a room facing the mountain the next day.) The hotel's breakfast buffet is as good as ever, and the style is There are many, and there are many things that babies can eat, such as steamed corn, purple sweet potato, steamed buns and noodles. Rooms are free of charge. Because the hotel is in a good location, it is very convenient to take public transportation, ride hailing services, or take out food. It only takes more than ten minutes to walk along the side of the hotel towards Dadonghai. But if you follow the navigation, you will be exhausted. There is a park navigation in front of the hotel that will take you around the park and then to Dadonghai, which is a full 20 minutes longer. In fact, you can just turn left when you leave the hotel and you will be there in ten minutes, and you can also pass various Internet celebrity stores. and supermarkets. I don‚Äôt understand why the navigation has to go around in a circle. Of course, online ride-hailing and taxi rides have to go around the park because they can't drive in the wrong direction, but it only costs six or seven yuan. You can go for a walk on the Dadonghai beach. If you feel tired, you can take the bus for two or three stops, and then you can take a taxi to the hotel in five or six minutes. Very convenient. There are buses to duty-free shops, major tourist attractions and the airport. You can reserve a car to the duty-free shop at the hotel front desk. If you don‚Äôt want to bring too many things or don‚Äôt bring all the things you want, you can go to Taobao Sam on JD.com. JD.com‚Äôs Sam‚Äôs delivery service is the next day, while Taobao‚Äôs delivery service is normal. Express delivery can be picked up at the front desk. The only bad thing about this hotel for me is that there is no refrigerator. I hope the hotel can add more. The hotel swimming pool is very nice and clean, with slides and swings next to it. I think the best value for money hotel

Hygiene: Generally, the maintenance is not very good, it can be seen that it is an old hotel, the room smells quite big, and the room smells a bit musty.
Service: Generally, I mentioned that there are crayfish in my set meal, but they didn't take the initiative to give it to me. When I remembered, it was already afternoon, and then I had to go to the front desk to get it by myself, but when I went out in the afternoon, I didn't have time to use it in the end. It says 200g, you can't take it out, you have to go to the restaurant to use it.
Environment: The environment is okay, but there is no mirror in the bathroom of the room, and there is a mirror directly facing the head of the bed. I was awakened two or three times in the middle of the night, and I didn't sleep well... The corridors are relatively dark.

msg:Sanya is very good but this hotel is not! It doesn‚Äôt feel like the five stars are there at all! On the first night, I went to the front desk and asked me to get my ID. I took my passport, but the front desk asked me if I could leave my passport overnight and return it to me tomorrow morning? ! The reason turned out to be that sacanner was turned off. I won‚Äôt be able to scan the data into the computer until tomorrow morning. (Who knows what will happen if my passport is taken away?) I said that I could wait for the machine to be restarted, and then he asked the more senior-looking employee next to him. After the employee asked me about my reservation information, he said that he only needed to show his hometown return permitü§∑ üèª‚ôÄÔ∏è The whole process already felt unprofessional, but because it was too late, I got the room and went back to the room.

The next day, I made a reservation for free snacks. I went to the front desk to ask, and the front desk actually said that this was an event that had been completed last month and was no longer available. I said that I did not specify when the event would be when I made the reservation, and then the front desk was kind enough to help me call the restaurant to ask if they could exchange it for another discount, and finally exchanged it for me with a coconut soup roll. Because I had my own schedule that day, it took me two days to arrive at the restaurant to eat. Unexpectedly, as soon as I arrived at the restaurant, the restaurant employee proactively greeted me and asked me if I wanted to dine in. But as soon as I took out the redemption voucher, he immediately I took a step back (really took a step back) and looked embarrassed. I expressed that I wanted to change to coconut soup. She immediately looked at the person who looked like her manager and finally asked, saying that the restaurant was very busy and could not serve it at the momentüôéüèª‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑üèª ‚ôÄÔ∏è.

In fact, I wasn't very interested in this soup. I planned to use it while having dinner in the restaurant, but the staff's attitude made me leave immediately. I ended up ordering ** takeout in the room to finish my dinner.

Another day, I slept in my room until about 4 pm. I had turned on the do not disturb light, but maybe the light facility was broken. The person cleaning the room knocked on the door, but no one responded. I called the front desk downstairs. A call came to my room and asked if I needed to tidy up the room. I said no. The staff on the phone said that they could help me pick up the trash. She said that it was not good for the trash to be left overnight. I thought about it and opened the door to the person who was cleaning the room. Then I continued to rest on the bed. Unexpectedly, the cleaning staff did not leave after collecting the garbage. Instead, he came to my bed and asked me to give him a good review. I don‚Äôt know if he outsourced staff/what services this hotel provides. I He also expressed cooperation and politely asked how to press the thumbs-up button, but there was no button at all, and nothing happened in the end.

In addition, although the toilet and shower in the hotel are separated, the water drainage is actually very poor. Every time you take a shower, all the water will flow out of the shower area. The entire toilet floor is covered with water, and the wash basin boils so much water that the entire room The lighting is also insufficient. Although there is a makeup mirror in the bathroom, it is located next to the wash basin. There is not enough space to put makeup or skin care products. The lights on the workbench in the room are too dim. Girls may want to bring their own makeup mirrors. .

It was very convenient to store my luggage when I checked out on the last day, but when I picked up my luggage, the staff actually said that I needed to pay for the room at the hotel, and my colleague had forgotten it when I checked in on the first day. (Still the same sentence: It‚Äôs not like a five-star hotel at all. It‚Äôs very unprofessional. What if I leave immediately after checking out without storing my luggage?)

The location is not bad, the whole trip was called Didi. There is a supermarket downstairs of the hotel but there are not many choices. There is no refrigerator in the room, so you can't buy overnight food. Although the air conditioner can adjust the temperature, it is obviously fake. It feels like central air conditioning and the facilities are really old. The only thing I am satisfied with is that the curtains are very good at blocking out light, and there is no light in the morning, and the water in the room is also refilled enough.

The hot water did not come until 8:30 in the evening. No sense of experience. The environment is so-so, and the sound of decoration was very noisy in the morning. I checked out of the room at 8 o'clock in the morning. It's annoying.

msg:Originally, the first night's stay was pretty good. Although the standard is five-star, it is still a bit old in terms of facilities, but it doesn't matter, after all, I went to the big bathtub. The second night was a nigh**are! After swimming in Dadonghai at four o'clock, I was going to take a shower and go out to eat. Then the front desk told me that there was no hot water until 6 o'clock. I called once and was informed at 19:20, but the water didn't come until after 8:00 in the evening! ! Well, the water will come when it comes, and I want to take a bath, but the water can't be soaked at all! In fact, I don‚Äôt blame the hotel for the lack of hot water, but the hotel has repeatedly shied away. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs what the service industry should do: 1. If there is no hot water in the room, you should contact the guest to inform the situation as soon as possible. I hope the guest understands, not the guest. I went to the hotel four times; 2. The guests couldn't take a shower without any emergency measures. Change to another place to wash? Check out and check in another hotel? 3. I didn't see any apology from the hotel from the beginning to the end. I think I can send some fruit plates? Little pastries? Or some other small thing to apologize to each guest, although it is not worth the money, it will make the guests feel valued, right? ! (Picture 1 is the normal water, and picture 2 is the water after the second night, and it is still the same color after washing for the third time)

msg:Outdated facilities, poor service! From the dilapidated lobby to the service attitude of the check-in staff, I already feel that this is not a so-called five-star hotel at all; there is a swimming pool on the balcony, but the water temperature is extremely low, and the experience is very poor; there is no coffee and tea bags in the room, and there is no refrigerator; The breakfast is very poor, the variety and taste are only three and a half stars. What's worse is that the plate for taking meals is pitifully small, only the coffee plate is big (I took a photo for comparison), and I can only take a small amount of food each time. Stacked together, it became a joke! The communication with the service staff was fruitless, and the attitude was extremely bad. They did not provide large plates. They said that they had only used this kind of coffee plate for breakfast for many years, and there was a male waiter who had a bad attitude and said contemptuously, "Who taught you Take more, can you take more times!?", there is no respect for customers at all, the management is extremely chaotic, and I will never patronize again! ! !

One thing I'm not satisfied with is that no matter the front desk or the switchboard, I want to know about travel and food through them. I feel that they don't know. I don't know whether it's because I dare not say that I'm afraid of taking responsibility or I really don't understand. The other is the first time when I checked in. One day at the head of the bed, there was a smell of unwashed detergent. After passing through the air-conditioned room for a few hours, the smell became much lighter at night.

The room layout is as shown on the official website. There is basically no difference, but the indoor facilities are a bit old. One corner of the light belt is not on, and the light in the corridor at the door is not on. The breakfast is relatively simple, with few choices, but it can also be full. The balcony of the room is equipped with a large bathtub, the water temperature is good, and the bath is not cold.

After the room, I called to change the room (the front desk only told me that this room type was only available at the end of the room, so why didn‚Äôt there be any instructions on it when I booked?? It took a long time before I agreed to change to another room type...) Later, I found out that the room type was changed The room I got was not as good as the room type I booked (although it was a free upgrade to a city view room, but outside the window is an unfinished building, and the decoration and sound insulation are very, very mediocre). But I completely gave up the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcontinuing to stay. After going through all this, I still hoped for the next day‚Äôs breakfast. The result was even worse. Something, or the hotel that called the hotel only after discovering it by myself has never contacted the hotel. I was stunned by the remnants ü§Ø Could it be that I didn‚Äôt see it during the rounds or what? Later, I contacted your hotel's GSM, but the attitude is still very indifferent.

The bathroom and toilet are separated by a glass wall. The front glass door in the first picture is for the toilet, and the rear glass door is for the bathroom. It's not bad, it doesn't interfere with each other, I like this kind of design a bit, hahaha
tub
The bathtub is on the balcony, we booked a mountain view room, and the other room is a street view room for my in-laws? Hahaha, oh yes, I bought a bathtub cover, so I can rest assured.
breakfast
Breakfast alone is 150 per person. When we booked a room, we included a variety of breakfasts, and they tasted good. Many foreigners also book hotels here, and everyone is very satisfied with their breakfasts. I will post it next time. Let's take a look at the breakfast in this hotel.

It is on the hillside, quiet in the middle of the noise, beautiful environment, service üëç, and the lady at the front desk is very enthusiastic and answers any questions. The room is clean, refreshing and warm, like ing. This hotel has done a good job of epidemic prevention measures. You need to scan the code to measure the temperature when you enter the door. It will remind you to wear a mask. It is a trustworthy hotel.

msg:1. The hotel did not take responsibility, false marketing.
The order included the result of kissing fish therapy, and told that the project was canceled because of the cold weather, and then communicated, and replied that it was canceled due to the epidemic. The epidemic didn't start on the day I checked in, nor did the weather get cold on the day I checked in. Decisively check out early, this kind of business will affect the travel mood. When I was leaving, there was still a promotional sign for Kiss Fish Spa at the door of the elevator, and I don‚Äôt know how many unsuspecting tourists were deceived.
2 Objectively evaluate the hotel: the hotel has only opened a few floors, it feels like it has not recovered from the epidemic, there are few waiters, there is only one person at the front desk, and it took a long time to check in
3. It is far away from the beach, and it is inconvenient to eat around. If you do not have a car, it is not recommended to live here
4. The breakfast at the hotel is 68 people. There is nothing but a few pieces of bread, fried rice, and fried noodles. The coffee pot is so dirty that I have no desire to drink it. Buying a bowl of instant noodles by yourself is much more worth it than this
5. The floor of the room feels like a concrete floor, as if it was remodeled from a warehouse
I have been to Sanya so many times, but this time I booked a hotel in a hurry, and I don‚Äôt know how to get such a high score. Very disagree with the attitude of the hotel to solve the problem
I have never written a review so seriously. I hope to give some advice to future tourists. Don‚Äôt just look at the good reviews, look at the bad reviews. The reasons for the good reviews are basically the same.

msg:The bed is very itchy. Two small beds are put together to pretend to be a big bed room. In order to make money, you don't have to face it. Hainan is the first in the world. The bedding has not been updated for ten years. After sleeping, the back is sore and the bed has no elasticity. Hygiene is very poor, sleep itching, get up and add a pair of trousers to fall asleep. This should be a dirt hotel, how can it be called a hotel.
Look at the 10,000-year-old scale that is used for the pulp. Does Hainan Hotel have no health supervision depar**ent?
The toilet is very smelly, and the smell of the public toilet will come out of it if it is not used. It is estimated that it is the smell of the pipe. It is too old and too old, and the smell will come out, which is very smelly.
This toilet is like a temporary bathroom, there is no waterproof platform, and the whole Jinshan Temple is flooded after taking a shower. You are really a hotel, are you sure it is not a land reform house?
There is no wall covering in the entire corridor, just the dirty white walls, which look bad, even worse than the Han court. Except in the city, where do you look like a hotel.
And a bit more fatal, the house can hear downstairs, the next door talking. Because of saving money on decoration, there is no sound insulation, and there is no wall covering on the walls. There is no carpet in the hallway.
Fortunately, I booked two hotels in Sanya. The last picture is of other hotels, they are real hotels, and the price is not as expensive as yours.
The comments here are to force a pit for everyone
It must be fun to come and play.
Those who have basic requirements for hygiene, are afraid of noise, and avoid lightning.
I changed the hotel today, and the last picture is of another hotel. For comparison, the new hotel's wife is too quiet. You can't hear the outside sound on the second floor, and the floor-to-ceiling windows are very tight and thick glass.
This reinforces my comment.

msg:The biggest problem with this hotel is that they are not clean! The salad I bought at Hema the day before disappeared after cleaning the room. I searched the whole room but couldn't find it. Finally, I called the hotel customer service center and they told me that the cleaner who cleaned the room took it away by herself! Finally, the cleaner came and said that she had never eaten the salad and thought it was leftovers. Then she saw that the date on it was yesterday and she thought it would become sour, so she took it away. She also said that she didn't dare to throw it away and put it in the workroom. She completely treated me as a **. I bought this salad and never opened it. The packaging was intact and sealed. Moreover, I put it on the TV cabinet and not in the trash can or on the ground. How could they use such an excuse? This kind of dirty hotel is really terrible. I will never stay there again. I hope everyone can learn from it and don't bring any valuables there, so that people will not think it is expired and take it away by themselves! Moreover, I woke up on the first day and found a particularly long yellow hair on the bed the next day, which shows that this hotel is not cleaned properly at all! What disappointed me most was that the hotel officials did not explain anything to me, but only let the cleaner come to explain it to me, which also indirectly proved that this kind of thing often happens in this hotel.

There are also many taverns nearby. I booked a garden view room for 6 days. The room is very good, but the privacy outside the window is not very good. I contacted Ctrip's housekeeper (Xiao Xian is very professional and fast) to see if I can change the room. The hotel quickly contacted me to help me change the room. Miss Pu Lifei at the front desk is also very helpful, and the overall experience is very valuable. I will stay here next time I come to Sanya.

Our cover was slept until more than 10 o'clock and the whole body was itchy. I couldn't stand it and asked the front desk to change it. The lobby manager of the room is still good.

As soon as the parents arrived at the front desk. The ladies checked in enthusiastically. And took the initiative to upgrade the room type. Because my mother is afraid of mosquito bites. The hotel specially showed two room types and let him choose by himself. Move to the ninth floor later. As soon as I entered the room, my mother said that this was really a five-star hotel. Bedding and washing do not reflect high-end. The service staff on the ninth floor are also very enthusiastic. Meet all their needs. Needless to say, the surrounding environment. It was originally set for three days. Today, I continued to live decisively. There is really nothing wrong with this hotel that people can tell. Five-star service, five-star accommodation. Five-star environment, because breakfast is required after the renewal, I will continue to comment on their five-star breakfast. Really, I am looking forward to it.

Existing problems: The rooms and facilities are a bit old, the breakfast can only be considered barely ok, there are not many types, and the taste is barely.
However, I think the biggest problem is the software, that is, the service. Although it is a luxury five-star, in fact, if the hardware is two breaths, the software is ten breaths. The concierge was there, and I didn‚Äôt know to come up to help with luggage; when the front desk checked in, I didn‚Äôt know that I would take the initiative to inform about breakfast and other related information. For these, there is no need to spend any money, as long as the training is enough, this is very lacking. The only well-received service was given to Sister Sun in the guest room. It was the best service attitude in the few days I stayed.
But in the end, I still have to say-although there are so many questions, considering the price of more than two hundred, what kind of bicycle do you want? So the price is very high. (Nevertheless, I hope the hotel can train and strengthen the sense of service)

It's a bit damp, and the taste is not very good! High performance-price ratio, this room is very good for this price!

My favorite is the swimming pool. Clear and bright. The photos are particularly good-looking. There is also a high level of safety awareness among coaches. I am afraid of the water[ÊµÅÊ≥™][ÊµÅÊ≥™] and dare not go down. Also teach us to swim. How to stand in the water. How to save yourself. . Very professional. Learned soon. Super nice. . There is also a fish spa pool. Itchy. There is also a water slide. The children like it the most. Have fun. Happy eatingüòä. Come again next time. .

Then, the front desk service is really awesome. The assistant manager in the lobby readily upgraded us to a deluxe business room. The child is so happy. Two people added 30 yuan for breakfast, and they couldn't finish eating a hearty meal. There is also a room with a large balcony, a sea view room with a bathtub, and the most beautiful one is the bougainvillea outside the guardrail. Standing on the balcony to see the scenery, I feel very happy. Because the stay was comfortable, it continued for two more days. Ignoring the regret of not having a disposable razor, this Four Seasons Sea Court is worth coming again.

msg:Coming from Crowne Plaza in the center,
The twelfth hotel in Sanya Tour
I didn't choose this one due to scoring issues in previous years
This time I came down for 6 nights to understand the difference between the scores and nearby scores.
In terms of room type and equipment new and old, it is better than the Crowne Plaza in the center
The defeat lies in the service, intercontinental or intercontinental, the room is poor but the staff is professional.
The staff in this store are mixed, and there is obviously a lack of system management training!
Some service staff belong to the level of express hotel
In fact, many of them are not suitable for working in the service industry because they are too subjective and too individual.
How many travellers staying in a hotel for a year is more than enough for an employee's annual salary
A waiter's attitude is afraid that he is not qualified enough to put himself too high

Of course there are also those who leave a good impression on the guests,
The message in the comment area can only depend on the luck of the in-house guests

The location of the hotel is centered in terms of Sanya
Breakfast is ok
The room layout is actually very good, the balcony is equipped with a bathing pool

Individual rat-like service attitude corrupts the overall accommodation experience
It can't be compensated by cheap price

It‚Äôs not a five-star hotel and I‚Äôm too lazy to type so many words

Although the decoration style has a sense of age, the overall facilities are still higher than those of business hotels. The hotel has a free underground parking lot and an open-air swimming pool. Although it is not very large, it is also suitable for those who like to play in the water. The breakfast buffet is ok. The room cleaning service is also very attentive. They are very enthusiastic to meet the needs and are very suitable for business travel. It can be reached by a 15-minute walk from the beach, and there are many delicious foods around
