msg:We recently had the pleasure of staying at the Conrad Hotel Beijing, and it was an exceptional experience. The breakfast buffet was delightful, and the atmosphere was perfect. What stood out the most was the calm and personalized feel of the breakfast, which made the experience even more enjoyable. The hospitality and service provided by Zoey, the guest manager, were truly incredible. Her attention to detail and willingness to go above and beyond made our stay even more special. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a top-notch experience in Beijing.

msg:The room was excellent: the bed was comfy, the lights were easy to turn on and off, there were outlets where there needed to be and even a wireless phone charger next to the beds, a comfortable well-lit desk and workspace, and a very spacious bathtub the faucets for which had a maximum hot water temperature that was perfectly set so that a bath couldn’t be too hot. The breakfast buffet was in a nice space and pretty good. The fitness center and pool are above average. The fitness center doesn’t include a sauna. Room service ordering can be done by WeChat, which is helpful since you can change the menu language to English. 

The location is close to a subway station and about a fifteen minute walk to the  shopping and restaurant streets in Sanlitun. 

Mini bar items are not free and some amenities in other hotels such as fruit or snacks when you arrive at your room are not included.

msg:I stayed from April 30 to May 2,2022.  The room and the view was beautiful and clean.  I enjoyed the bathtub and took advantage of it so many times.  I was pleasantly surprised by the service in the executive lounge. They were so friendly and accommodating.  One attendant I enjoyed speaking with quite a bit. Another attendant arranged to have someone escort me to covid-testing place so I could get it done for free.  The service in the restaurant on May 1st was outstanding. Because of COVID restrictions, service was limited to ordering.  But the waitress was so accomodating. She arranged a set of pastries for me. She brought me juice. She brought me two sets of pancakes because they were so small, and buffet style i would have had more than what was given.  She was always available.  And it made me feel valued. I really appreciated the service and I was looking forward to breakfast the next day.  However, this standard of service was not to be repeated.  On May 2, I went down and there were only three of us in the restaurant, a Chinese couple and myself.   The waitress seemed very unwilling to serve me.  I noticed the other table was full of food.  I had ordered two sets of pancakes and only received one (each serving had two very small pancakes on it).  She brought about a plate of pastries but interrupted me when I wanted to choose more than one pastry and said wait a moment. Then she went over to the other table and had them order. She never brought back the pastries again.  She never offered to serve me any more food after that. She brought the other table several coffees but I was not offered the opportunity to order any more.  She acted busy but was doing nothing and I felt so humiliated.  I know that I am not Chinese. But it is a hotel, and there were only three of us in the restaurant. The contrast to the service the day before was so opposite.  Both tables are guests. We both should have had the same service.  If it had been busy, I would have been more understanding.

msg:I still like Conrad as always. Although it is a 13-year-old hotel, the room is still well maintained. When I checked in, I was upgraded to a panoramic king-size bed room. The view in the room is very good. I can see the China World Trade Center. The room is also very large. There are welcome fruits when I check in, and there are a lot of things in the minibar. The breakfast is also very good, combining Chinese and Western styles. The taste and presentation are very good. The design style of the restaurant is like a European library. The appearance of the hotel is also very beautiful and very distinctive. The swimming pool and gym are all available. The service is as good as always. In short, the experience is super good. Conrad is still yyds! Highly recommended! 
When I checked out, I was given a small gift, two Conrad bears, a bouquet of flowers and a box of chocolates. 
In short, the hotel service, hotel environment and hotel catering are all very good, highly recommended! ! ! No overturning! 
The hotel guest service is great. You can greet the check-in preferences and arrangements in advance. The guest manager Zoey is professional in service! ! !

msg:I compared many hotels before departure and finally chose Conrad. The guest department called me to confirm the night before check-in. The front desk also helped us upgrade the room type, which I didn’t know about. The service and facilities during the stay were great. The cleaners also cleaned the room every day. The official pictures are exactly the same as the real scene. Dry and wet separation + two washbasins + bathtub + mirror TV! I like it very much. (The only drawback is that the Samsung TV in the room is stuck in PPT. I hope to upgrade it. Everything else is perfect.) The hotel is basically about 10 to 20 minutes away from various attractions. This is the key point! The weather in Beijing is very good and there are many delicious foods. I will go to the places I didn’t go this time next time. Thank you Cecily for helping me register for membership and delayed check-out. Thank you Guest Manager Zoey and Alice for being great and considerate and giving us small gifts. In short, the stay experience is very good and I will repurchase.

msg:Although this stay was short, it left a very deep impression on me, and I must talk about it!
Service: The overall quality of the hotel staff is very high. The impression given from the moment I entered the door was very good. The young lady generously and enthusiastically led me to the front desk, and the front desk was able to solve all the problems I raised with care. The sister who cleaned my room was very considerate and would help me sort out the messy items and scattered clothes. The concierge was even more considerate to help me plan the travel route.
Environment: Although the hotel is located near the Third Ring Road, it does not feel noisy at all. It overlooks the city landscape and gets warm and quiet in the hustle and bustle. The rooms and restaurants are spacious and bright, and the beds are also very comfortable, allowing me to enjoy a good sleep.
Breakfast: This must be emphasized. Their breakfast restaurant has its own style. It is called the library restaurant. All the food is on the bookshelf, elegant and unique.
Facilities: Although the hotel has been open for more than 10 years, it is still very well maintained, and it is more reassuring to live without formaldehyde.
To sum up, if I come to Beijing next time, I am afraid that the only choice is the Conrad Hotel Beijing.

msg:During the May Day trip to Beijing, I stayed at Conrad. The main building was designed by Ma Yansong, which is quite iconic for a hotel.
Transportation: It is close to the Third Ring Road, so it is very convenient to take a taxi or the subway. It takes about half an hour to get from Beijing South Railway Station to the hotel by subway.
Environment: Next to it is Tuanjiehu Park, where you can overlook the pleasure of boating on the lake in the park. The hotel is not far from the Guomao business district and the Sanlitun business district, about a 20-minute walk. If you don't like crowded and noisy places, Conrad, which is hidden in the city, must be suitable for you.
Facilities and hygiene: The hotel has been open for more than ten years, and the facilities and home maintenance are OK. The overall decoration style and room layout are more in line with my expectations. The library breakfast restaurant on the first floor is a holy place to open, and it is easy to take pictures. The view of the executive lounge is great (I didn't go to the top floor because I upgraded to a panoramic room this time)
Service: I give full marks for the service. Whether it is the front desk or the concierge, including the cleaning aunt, everyone is very polite and can take the initiative to consider the customers. This service awareness is great and I hope it will be maintained. Due to my own negligence in booking the wrong date, Ctrip communicated with the hotel front desk and helped me adjust the check-in date in time, so that my trip went smoothly. After arriving at the hotel, the front desk also helped me upgrade the room proactively, which also surprised me. The concierge offered to deliver the luggage to the room after the room was cleaned (very considerate). The cleaning lady was very polite and helped me fold my pajamas during the cleaning (a bit unexpected).
Finally, a little digression: Conrad's panoramic room is worth recommending, the view is great (even more amazing when the China Zun is lit at night); I think Conrad is also a perfect match for those who want to eat Four Seasons Minfu roast duck. Go to Four Seasons Minfu to get a number and then go back to the hotel to rest. When the number is close, you can go directly there, which is about 10 minutes' walk. There is no need to wait at the scene (there are too many people at the scene). All the photos were taken with a mobile phone.

msg:Friends who love hotels, has Conrad Beijing caught your eye? I saw the hotel's advertisement on a certain website and fell in love with it. It is the right choice for a hotel with a sense of design. The price is very affordable among Beijing's five-star hotels. The location is very good. It takes more than 10 minutes to walk to Sanlitun and 20 minutes to walk to Guomao Big Pants.
Service: A manager with a ponytail at the front desk checked in very neatly and professionally, which is worth learning from several other employees.
I also want to thank a tall girl in a white suit who may be from the concierge depar**ent. Because I wore pajamas when I went to pick up the takeaway, she said that the place to pick up the takeaway was a bit far and it would be cold outside, so she took the initiative to help me pick it up. Thank you very much!
There was only a small episode. I felt that the service staff who answered the switchboard and the duty manager who solved the telephone complaints should really practice their professional ethics.
The hotel's view room is worth staying in. The window is large and you can see the Chinese 鐵.
The hotel breakfast is semi-buffet. It was very frustrating to eat it for three consecutive days because there was almost no change. I recommend the waffles, the others are not worth recommending.

I would like to thank the front desk staff whose name I don't remember. They enthusiastically introduced the hotel's facilities and restaurants and helped with room arrangements. There were many people in the hotel lobby during the event, but it was well organized and I didn't have to wait for a room. It was awesome 👍🏻

Although the facilities are a bit old, the service is really good. Everyone's service is good, even the cleaning lady and the waiter at the door are very enthusiastic, especially the three beauties Sophia, Alice and Zoey, who gave me a very good experience. Knowing that there are children staying, they gave us little bears and small desserts, which is very considerate. I think I will choose Conrad next time!

The only thing is that the 240 breakfast is really average. Not much choice either. Or takeout is more customary.

The hotel customer relationship manager contacted me the day before departure and asked what time I would arrive the next day, what room type I liked, whether it was quiet or had a good view. When I learned that I was pregnant, I was very thoughtful and prepared 6 different kinds of fruits for me when I checked in the next day. Considering that some pregnant women have sugar control, they also prepared low-sugar fruits for me. They prepared a humidifier for fear of dryness in the north, and prepared many bottles of water. There was water in different locations, such as water at the bedside and sink. It was really considerate. If you have any questions, Sophia and Zoey can be contacted directly on WeChat and answer patiently. I give them a thumbs up. The breakfast environment is also very good!

The building outside the hotel was designed by Ma Yansong, which is very sci-fi. The best thing is that the executive lounge has a good view. Standing by the window, there is a 270° unobstructed view. You can see Tuanjie Lake and the CCTV building. The sun shines in and it is comfortable and cozy [love][love][love] The library restaurant in the lobby on the first floor is very special.

Thanks to Sophia who helped me book the room this time and Linda in the executive lounge. I will continue to stay next time [grin]

The hotel is also close to the consulate, and it only takes about 10 minutes by taxi during peak hours. Because of business, before and after check-in, every time I received a courier, Harry, Sophia and Zoey would arrange to deliver it to the room.
Although there are not so many varieties of breakfast, it is partly a la carte, but it does not meet the needs. The service attitude of the restaurant staff is very good and enthusiastic. The restaurant has a sense of design, like a bookstore.
The location is very convenient, not far from the attractions and Taikoo Li. If you want to taste various food stores, search a large area around.
A very pleasant stay experience.

msg:It was a speechless experience. From the three girls at the front desk who couldn't even smile at the guests (most likely interns from a vocational school), to the silent room card, all of a sudden, the three girls smiled at the front at the same time, and the one in the middle with braces laughed! I followed their line of sight and saw a tall male waiter walking towards them with a grin and mumbling something. I, the guest, was completely ignored and transparent during the whole process of opening the room card.
Ok, entered the guest room, the room decoration was OK, there were no tea bags, called for tea bags, coffee capsules and water, 35 minutes later, urged, 10 minutes later, urged again, and finally delivered, it took 55 minutes. The waiter was very young and a little awkward, basically a vocational school intern. I thought I understood.
I was ready to go out, and when I looked straight, a ball of white toilet paper was actually stuck in the cat's eye! ! God, I was shocked, what does this mean, why is the toilet paper blocked here, is it clean? Has it been used? Prank? Or is someone afraid of peeping? Why can't I see it when the cleaning staff is cleaning?
30 minutes later, a manager came up and said he was deeply sorry and would change to a larger room for free. To be honest, his tone, expression and body language did not match this "five-star" hotel located in the central area of ​​Beijing.
He spoke in a whining voice, which meant that he was sorry that he had changed to a larger room anyway. Suddenly, he changed the subject and said to me that your friend could not come up and had to go downstairs to register for a visitor ID card immediately. He had to go downstairs to register immediately. This manager seemed to have turned into a joint defense team, extremely excited and anxious. Just like that, my friend was kicked downstairs! I was so embarrassed!
OK, okay, he said he would take me to the large room. In the elevator, he introduced that this large room was their best room, as if he meant that I had picked up a big bargain and should be happy. I replied that it was not necessary and I could just change to a clean large bed room in one day. This guy insisted. OK.
Entering the large room (just a corner hall, not comfortable, and the large cloth sofa was dirty and mottled), because I had something urgent to do, the previous one had been delayed for two hours! ! I put down my bag and wanted to go out, but the manager shocked me again and said, "I saw you took a lot of tea bags and coffee capsules just now (he said "take", wow!), I'll get you some more tea bags and coffee capsules!" Oh, I came to taste tea and coffee here! How can I say I haven't tasted it before! My God, this EQ is basically zero.
I couldn't afford to waste time, so I hurried to go out to do something. While I was waiting for the car in the lobby, the manager ran to me again and loudly explained why it is important for visitors to register! ! I'm really convinced, Tom, if you don't work in the urban management, joint defense team, etc., it will be a loss to society!
What's more uncomfortable is still to come. This morning, with the morning sunlight, this "best big room" was illuminated. There were two bloody marks of the bodies of mosquitoes on the wall beside the bed, and there were lumps of unknown liquids on the sofa opposite the bed. The marble floor of the locker room was dilapidated with big pits, and the sofa in the lobby was particularly dirty!
This is the second time I write a bad review, and this time it really pissed me off! From the front desk, telephone operator, waiter, manager, to hygiene and decoration, nothing is satisfactory! ! I will never stay in this "five-star hotel" Conrad Hotel! I will also tell my friends around me.

When they learned that I brought two children, they also prepared children's toiletries. Supplies! There are also welcome fruits and little bears! During this period, I specially brought more mineral water because it was relatively dry! Great care! The breakfast tastes okay, you can order some food a la carte, but there are many people and you need to queue up! The waiters are also quite enthusiastic! Overall good!

msg:Highly recommended! Whether you are on a business trip or traveling with your family, it is an excellent choice! First of all, I am very satisfied with the network, which is smooth and fast! I came to Beijing for a weekend trip and then did some work in the hotel room. After the whole day, the network signal was excellent and the conference call was also smooth! Secondly, their double bed is very large, suitable for a family with older children. The view outside the window is very good, especially when the sun sets at five o'clock in the afternoon. The hotel service is also quite good. As expected of being owned by Hilton, the doorman takes the initiative to deliver luggage. The guest service specialists Sophie and Ruby are attentive and thoughtful, and can arrange prompt and timely arrangements when needed👍

The well-designed building can be seen as soon as you get off the subway, and it is very convenient to travel. The room is clean and every service is in place. You can fall in love with the restaurant after just one meal. It feels like dining in a library. You can't help but want to stay a little longer. The decoration and food taste are very good. Special thanks also go to Ruby and Sophia from the Guest Depar**ent. They added WeChat in advance to understand the guests' needs before checking in. They upgraded the room type when the occupancy rate allowed. Even small things like adding some body lotion were always responsive. It was really great. grateful. Next time I come to Beijing, I will still choose Conrad.

It happened to be my wife's birthday when we stayed at the hotel. We originally only booked a deluxe king room for one night. After hearing about it, Harry Liu Zehao, the guest relations manager, directly helped us apply for an executive panoramic king bed. We can see the lake view and CBD outside the window. Overall The view is amazing! The breakfast that comes with Conrad's room is also very rich and of good quality. The restaurant environment is clean and well-designed.

The young man at the front desk, Howard, needs to be praised in real name for his enthusiastic help in solving our practical travel problems. The breakfast was also commendable. Although the queue was very long, the lady in charge was afraid of letting the guests wait for an extra minute and urged the waiter to clear the table as quickly as possible for the guests. The menu will also be brought out in advance to allow guests to choose what to order in advance, so that they can have breakfast immediately after sitting down. The choices in the breakfast buffet are also rich and the quality is very good. The hotel facilities are a bit outdated. After all, it is a hotel that has been open for a long time. In addition, most hotels in the Third Ring Road of Greater Beijing are older than Conrad, so we cannot be too demanding about the newness of the hardware. Overall, it was a very satisfying stay. The service at the front desk and restaurant was very satisfactory, and the cleaning of the guest rooms was also very timely. Next time I go to Beijing, I will still choose Conrad.

The particularly outstanding and deep impression comes from the hotel's very, very excellent humanistic care. The very very excellent customer relations manager Harry Liu Zehao, from the considerate and very warm phone call before check-in, to the super compliments he met unexpectedly after check-in. From the concierge service to the wonderful experience during my stay, I deeply fell in love with this very international hotel. I chose to stay at the Conrad Hotel because it was specially recommended by my daughter’s classmate who was studying abroad. After checking in, I found out that I stayed at the hotel. Most of the guests are young foreign business people with international education. The humanistic a**osphere is very international. The hotel's Western breakfast is really great! The cheese and black coffee are very authentic and delicious, and the hotel's executive lounge afternoon tea and happy hour are of very good quality! Give handsome Harry 10,000 likes, because your service makes us feel very, very good! ! ! You are a customer relationship manager who is particularly worthy of training! ! ! come on! ! !

We were upgraded to a deluxe king room for free. We were very lucky these days. The weather was very good and the visibility was very high.

It is very comfortable to live in and the things are reasonably arranged and the space is large. The room attendants are also very clean and fast. Special guest service manager Annie Ni The people are very warm and generous. They gave me a fruit plate and the small cake in picture 7 when I checked in. I couldn't help but feel at home. Denny, the concierge, was also very nice and stored some cheap daily necessities for me for a month before I came. I thought they would take care of it. , and it was delivered to my room intact. I really like everything about this hotel. Conrad is definitely my first choice when coming to Beijing👍👍👍

msg:This is my second time staying at Conrad Beijing. The hotel is close to Chaoyang Railway Station and Sanlitun business district. It is very convenient for traveling, shopping and eating. It is a five-minute walk from Hujialou subway station. The location is relatively quiet in the bustle, and the hardware facilities Everything is okay. After all, most hotels in Beijing are older. I decided to check out of the Legend on my first night and switch to the Conrad. But what makes me most satisfied is the hotel’s meticulous service. Special thanks to the beautiful staff member Harry for his warm service. It added a sense of warmth to the journey. I will choose here again next time in Beijing.

msg:It is a hotel I like very much. I have stayed in a suite at Conrad Hangzhou before, so I know this hotel is very good. The location of the hotel is very good. Sanlitun is just downstairs, and the Four Seasons Minfu Hujialou store is just a few steps away. The front desk of the hotel upgraded us to a room type. When we entered, there was a huge floor-to-ceiling window with a beautiful view of Beijing CBD. The baby likes to play in the room very much, because it is big and can be played freely. It's clean, tidy and bright, and it's great for taking photos. We were a little tired due to the tight itinerary we were traveling with our baby, but the hotel gave us a very comfortable and warm experience that healed our bodies and minds. The most satisfying thing is the hotel's service. In the guest relations team, Fay was the one who added me on WeChat at the beginning, and Harry, the guest relations manager Jennie, and the team manager Melody, who was beautiful, kind and lovely, and who always took care of our daily life, were friendly and friendly with us when we first arrived. We chatted, cared about our diet, and reminded us of the slightly cooler weather in the morning and evening. It can be said that they were considerate and considerate. I think hotel facilities are one aspect, and service is also a very important aspect. They put guest relations first and made our stay comfortable and enjoyable. This is what a good hotel is about: healing. By the way, I also like the breakfast in the hotel. It is a Western-style cold breakfast with yogurt, oa**eal cups, various beef slices, skim milk, and delicious bread. It is very suitable for those who want to lose weight. My favorites are the blueberry yogurt and toasted bread pudding. The Chinese breakfast is also good. It is worth mentioning that there are beef noodles that can be ordered. Because the baby cannot eat spicy food, they specially made non-spicy tomato and egg noodles for us. So next time I take my parents on a trip, I will still choose Conrad.

msg:I have stayed in many hotels, but this was my first time trying Conrad, which is definitely an unexpected surprise on this trip. Personally, I feel that the overall service of Conrad in Beijing far exceeds expectations (even on a crowded time like National Day), which is better than that in other southern tourist cities, such as Grand Hyatt, Hilton, Intercontinental, St. Regis, etc. The level of service is better (breaking the usual impression of poor service in the north). Although the hotel hardware has no advantages, the training and service of the staff can definitely make up for it. During the entire stay, the two ladies from the hotel's guest relations team, Melody and Fay, provided ceiling-level service and worked in every detail, explaining what is meant by meticulous and just the right service. I don't know whether it's because the hotel industry in Beijing is too busy or because the Conrad brand itself has such a closed loop of standards. If I have the opportunity in the future, I will definitely choose this hotel again.

msg:During the National Day, I took my two kids on a trip to Beijing and stayed at Conrad for 5 days. Although the hotel has been built for 10 years, the entire hotel is still well maintained and does not feel old at all. The location is also very good. It only takes 5 minutes to walk to the subway station. DiDi is also very convenient for taking taxis. The deluxe twin room I stayed in had a large 1.4-meter single bed and a large washbasin with a bathtub. The breakfast is also very delicious, especially the muffins, waffles and beef noodles. I won't get tired of eating it even for 5 days. I have stayed at Conrad Hotels in Koh Samui and Macau before. In comparison, what impressed me most about Conrad Beijing was its home-away-from-home service. Before checking in, I contacted the hotel to confirm my check-in order. Hotel guests Jennie, the manager of the relationship service team, took the initiative to add me to WeChat to understand my check-in needs and meet them one by one. Every time we leave or come back from the hotel, Jennie will greet us warmly and give the children small balloons and toys, which makes them happy. The children were very happy. Harry and Liu Zehao were also very patient when dealing with us later. They were considerate of the fact that we had two children and tried their best to meet all relevant needs. He specially greeted us on the day of check-in and also prepared a hotel gift for the children in the room. As soon as the children entered The room was pleasantly surprised, thank you so much! As a tourist from the south, Beijing is a bit dry in autumn and I drink more water. I asked the housekeeping depar**ent to replenish 6 bottles of water. The next day, Lu Zhenghua from the housekeeping depar**ent sent us a box of water and wrote a thoughtful message. The little card is so heart-warming! After I left the hotel, there was some takeout left at the hotel. Melody from the guest service depar**ent actively helped me pick it up and returned the takeout at the same time. I must give a big thumbs up to Conrad Beijing’s service. I will stay at Conrad Beijing again in the future~~

msg:I didn’t travel much during the epidemic, so I chose Beijing, the capital, during this National Day holiday. I checked a lot of guides in advance and finally settled on Conrad, which is relatively close to Sanlitun and has an environment that I like.
After communicating in advance, we were given a room with a better view and view. From checking in, contacting room service, having breakfast, leaving the hotel door to checking out, all service staff responded in a timely manner and were very warm and considerate.
The layout and decoration of the room are also luxurious and elegant. However, the door cracks and floor of the bathroom are slightly moldy. It is recommended to maintain it regularly.
After checking out, Annie gave us afternoon tea as a gift so we could have a good rest. When the vehicle arrived, Denny also helped put our luggage in the vehicle. Finally, I unexpectedly received a cute little bear. Overall, it's a pretty satisfying housing experience.
I will stay again next time I come to Beijing. Looking forward to seeing you again~~

The location of the hotel is very convenient near Sanlitun. It is a few minutes walk from the subway entrance. The room is very clean. The most important thing is that it feels like home. It can be said that the service is the ceiling among the star hotels I have stayed in. Special thanks to Jennie and Chai Chai for their service and help during the stay. .
Jennie contacted me and added me on WeChat before checking in. I arrived at the hotel after 12 o'clock on the day of check-in. The room type I booked was not packed yet. Chai Chai upgraded the room type for free and I checked in at 12 o'clock. Jennie helped carry the luggage to the room and gave a lot of travel advice along the way. She gave the children two cute bears, snacks, bubble bath gel and ducklings. The children were very happy and even took them when they left. Enjoying the mooncakes, macarons and chocolates provided by the hotel.
A great hotel stay experience, I have recommended it to other good friends😀

Service: The check-in experience this time was very good. From the noon on the day of check-in, Fay, the hotel's guest relations staff, called me in advance to confirm some sleeping habits and preferences. After arriving at the hotel, Melody warmly welcomed me in the lobby, and the room attendant Bi Qing prepared latex pillows and coffee in the room in advance. The room was also in very good condition, and with Byredo toiletries, I was given two Conrad bears and mooncakes before checking out.

Environment: The hotel itself is a quiet place in the bustle. The transportation is very convenient. You can walk to Taikoo Li Sanlitun in 10 minutes. A few hundred meters across the road is the Hujialou subway station, and one stop away is the Guomao.

In summary, this experience was very good. I will choose Conrad again next time I come to Beijing.

Come back at night to see the surprises prepared for the children. very careful. Standing in the executive suite, you can see the evening street view.

Although it is a hotel that has been in operation for ten years, there are always some warm experiences in terms of service. After the check-in reservation was successful, the staff Cyrene took the initiative to communicate the needs of the check-in, and followed up the service throughout the check-in after arriving at the store, giving people a feeling of being at home.

I couldn't turn on my phone in the morning, and I was very anxious. I wanted to try the charger in the concierge to see if it was my charging device. It still wouldn't turn on. Under the circumstances, this little brother came over to help me clean the charging port, and finally turned on the phone for me by using the project startup method. The phone was out of power all morning and I was very anxious. Thanks to this little brother, I restarted a new day!

The hotel is very clean, decorated in light colors, the bath products are also very good, the coffee is also in capsules, the breakfast is basically fine except that not every employee can order, and the service is fast! Happy stay!

msg:This is the first time I’ve written a negative review after using Ctrip for so many years. I originally chose Conrad because I believed in the word-of-mouth that Hilton has built over the years. Since I checked in on 7/11, the hotel’s various services are also online until 7. / On the morning of the 16th, while eating breakfast, I suddenly felt pain in my left leg from being scratched by a sharp object
Turning over the table, I saw three rusty screws directly exposed on the outside of the table (as shown in the picture below). Fortunately, I have rough skin and thick flesh. After pressing for a while, the bleeding stopped. If a younger child bumps into it, the consequences will be It’s really unimaginable. I think it’s a blessing among misfortunes. With this idea, I started a friendly communication with the hotel. At the beginning, the two staff members had a better attitude and said that they had no right to reduce the service fee of about 300 yuan for me. But Such a low-level problem in such a hotel is exaggerated to the extreme, but what really made me angry and disappointed was the speech of their manager on duty at the time. At that time, I told him that I hoped to reduce the room fee for one day as compensation, but he expressed my injuries. Even if you go to the hospital, the medical bills are only two or three hundred dollars. They have already expressed their sincerity with this arrangement. I don’t understand whether the shortage of hotel rooms during the peak tourist season has made this manager so confident.
When a problem arises, he can use this tone to talk to the customer. When I clearly expressed dissatisfaction with the result, he continued to say that he is also a part-time worker. It is impossible for him to lose money to satisfy the customer. It is difficult to be objective. Evaluate the mental state of the manager on duty when he said these words. From the beginning to the end, he has repeatedly emphasized that even if his leader is present, he will definitely not agree to give us compensation for one day's room fee. If there are really relevant leaders of Conrad who can see this Based on the comments, I would like to ask how the hotel trains such a manager on duty. I don’t know if the hotel thinks that as an ordinary consumer, my appeal (compensation for one day’s room fee) after encountering a problem is in the The lion opened his mouth wide, so I adopted this approach. Now I will tell you clearly that I will not hesitate to ask for the compensation of 300 yuan. I just want every consumer's appeal to be taken seriously, and every problem that may cause safety hazards is taken seriously by the hotel.

I really want to help customers solve problems. This is very rare. I think it is very worthwhile. In today’s era, I think this kind of practice is actually quite rare. Many people only pay attention to things, and the eldest sister not only cares about things, but also He also cares about people and is very empathetic. As a guest of Conrad, I am very touched. Later, I reported it to the guest manager AnnieNi, only to find out that the eldest sister is called Wei Wenjie. Annie is also a very service-minded staff member, and also has a lot of ownership.

There is also a park with an excellent environment opposite the hotel, where you can run in the morning to exercise. There are buses and subways outside the hotel, and the bus travel is very convenient. The hotel environment is good, the service is good, in short, the experience is great!

msg:Very few comments. But it is indeed a 10-year-old hotel, and the details are unsightly.
The TV screen in the bathroom is inlaid in the center, and it is not clear to see it diagonally in the bath. Service OK. The food and buffet breakfast on the first floor are of average quality. (I couldn’t order the dishes on the top of the comments. They said they didn’t have them. I used to do events. The updated menu lacks aesthetics and doesn’t match the pictures on the Internet.) It is recommended to learn from the Hilton Waldorf Astoria Hotel. Thanks!

msg:A five-star hotel with less than 1500 a day is a bit unsatisfactory
 First of all, there is no robot or concierge for takeaway. The room service staff need to go downstairs to pick it up. The takeaway table is still at the gate. It is 12 degrees now. It is understandable during the epidemic, but now...
Secondly, the electric socket in the bathroom is broken, that is to say, you need to hold it in the room to dry your hair blindly.
Again the conditioner in the bathroom was empty empty empty! Shouldn't it be? Don’t they add it at any time when cleaning the room? That is to say, I don’t have the awareness at all. I want to wash half of my hair and call you to add it?
In the end, the room needed a bottle opener. The first time I called the front desk, a little brother said that there was a drawer in the room. You looked for it in four or five places, but he couldn’t find it. Then he said it shouldn’t be. Let a colleague come up to see it, and then a young lady came into the room. After a search, she said that there was really no surprise. She said that I would send you one? what? Shouldn’t I bring one up and give it directly? I wonder if I’m blind?
Remember these, hope to improve service, after all, we are five-star

Pros: The soft decoration of the room is very warm, the area is large, and the location of the hotel is good
Disadvantages: The lobby and elevator room in the public area are relatively small. If the occupancy rate is high, there will be people coming and going. It is surprising that there is no tea bag in the room.

The Conrad in Beijing should be the first in the country, so the facilities and rooms are slightly older than the newly opened Conrads in other cities in recent years. A little bit, but it doesn’t affect the living experience at all. The check-in experience is still very comfortable, and the hotel service is also very good. I was lucky to meet a very nice lady at the front desk, Hallie, who took good care of me and responded to every request. She even arranged for us on her rest day halfway through. After everything, I also prepared a full set of toiletries, pajamas, slippers and hotel gifts for the children, which brought our family a perfect check-in experience, so we returned it and continued to stay at Bulgari for two nights. Conrad, the breakfast food is also very good and the variety is healthy and rich. I will stay again next time! recommend!

The facilities are very old, many sockets in the room are loose, and the toilet is leaking. When I arrived at the hotel at 5:30 in the afternoon, the room hadn't been cleaned yet, let alone the welcome fruit, which I hadn't seen before. For children plus breakfast, the charging standards of the restaurant and the front desk are not uniform, and you need to queue at the door for breakfast, which is a poor experience.

I think a room worth 2,000 yuan a day is not as good as an All Seasons hotel worth 500 yuan a day. Maybe the hotel management is making money and doesn't know how the modern hotel service industry works.

The room looks relatively big and has everything it needs, but it's actually not that great. It took me a long time to figure out the nondescript light switch case. The air conditioner couldn't adjust the temperature, so I had no choice but to turn it off.

I didn't really care about it at the time, after all, I really needed to clean up. It's understandable that the front desk of the hotel is not as smooth as Grand Hyatt. It seems that they are all newcomers... But I arrived at the store at 17:30 to get the room card and asked to check out until 16:00. The front desk replied to me: Of course But it can only be up to 16:00 at the latest... I'm so confused... Do I owe you all? ... It seems that I did something wrong. Do you want to take advantage of it? ... Isn't this what you should have proposed? You didn't pack it up, did you call the customer early to remind me to come to the store and go out, what are you still dragging here? ...

Of course, this is also in line with Conrad's positioning. After all, it is only slightly better than Hilton... The scenery is really good, but the lobby is very small and there are no decorations, the executive lounge is very small and there is no decoration, there are few or no freshly squeezed orange juice during happy hours, The room has a large character and no sense of design, and there are few breakfast items... Everything really fits Conrad's positioning...

An ordinary business trip hotel is only worth 1,000 yuan. If I want to live in 3,000 yuan, I think too much~~ For 3,000 yuan, I will definitely go to Intercontinental or Park Hyatt next time

In order to have a complete experience, I ordered a meal at the all-day dining restaurant, and then went to the Chinese restaurant for dinner. The same level of service, environment, and meals are really okay.
The bears were given to two children, which was very considerate. The children's toiletries are very a**ospheric and easy to use.
Although the spare parts are not in small bottles, they are also very useful.

msg:The third hotel to stay in Beijing during the National Day holiday is my favorite one. It is fashionable and stylish. The concierge Bob contacted in advance to inquire about the check-in needs. He liked the hotel bear 🐻, and also gave two. The arranged room has a good view, and the room is modern, simple, bright and comfortable. The breakfast is beautiful and delicious, and the hotel concierge and front desk service are very conscious and enthusiastic! The detail service is very good, the express delivery also has a special registration and storage, and one day it helped me deliver it to the room! It was almost two o'clock in the middle of the night and the temperature of the air conditioner needed to be adjusted. The front desk notified the engineer to arrive at the scene in a few minutes, which was efficient. Stayed for three days, the overall experience is very good!

The hotel has been open for a few years, but the warm professional service of the staff more than makes up for the hardware.

Although this one in Beijing opened relatively early, the room is actually quite new and clean and bright. It has all the necessary facilities, especially the bathroom layout is very comfortable. Byredo is used for toiletries, and it is also very enjoyable to use.
Special thanks to Bob from the concierge depar**ent, who contacted us to confirm the itinerary the day before arriving at the store. He also gave us very thoughtful care and service during the few days of our stay. He patiently helped us solve the problem of pop-up windows in Beijing. Conrad's service is really good. make people feel at home.
There are not many varieties of breakfast, but the taste is very good. It is done with great care. Thank you Conrad for your hospitality.

The hotel's warm service and excellent location, the overall design style are more like. Staying for 2 days this time, from the moment the car arrived at the hotel, I felt that what should be the benchmark in the industry, the concierge has waited beside the car to open the door for you to pick up your luggage and guide you to the lobby before the car stopped When I checked in, I met Hai Li, the staff member who needs to be thanked the most this time. I received all our recommendations on check-in, attractions, food, etc., and prepared many gifts for us. Unfortunately, there was a small child the day before leaving Beijing. The partner encountered the pop-up window of the health treasure, and it was also Haili who helped and reported the relevant information, so that we could end the journey of this scripture normally and smoothly.
Facilities: The decoration style of the hotel gives a sense of elegance and luxury
Breakfast: The breakfast is really amazing. It is better than 80% of the hotel buffet breakfasts. The taste, variety and quantity of the breakfast are just right.

msg:Because the hotel has exposed hygiene problems before, the hotel asked to change the bedding after arriving at the store. The front desk said that no one came, so I called the switchboard and asked me why I wanted to change it. I explained it again. The lobby manager called and asked me why I wanted to change it. I explained it again and finally changed it. Regardless of whether the hygiene is good or not, I have stayed in many 5-star hotels at home and abroad, and the auntie is very fast. I don’t think their hygiene is reassuring. I feel that changing the bedding is very tiring for them. In addition, the front desk told me that the room on the high floor was closed when I checked in. I thought it was a banquet. Later, the lobby manager told me that the cleaning was not finished. I don't mind changing to a room on a higher floor later. The front desk didn't tell me at all. In addition, the day before the guest service came, I told me that I would try my best to satisfy the high floor and clean it carefully, but there was no row in the room, and the toilet floor was dirty. Finally, When I came to check in that day, the concierge staff at the door saw the foreigner get off the car, and greeted me very enthusiastically. I walked in with my luggage, and no one paid attention to me the whole time. The most interesting thing is to look at the pictures. I complained about the problem on the first day when I arrived at the store, but there was no response at all. After I left, the guest service said that they could upgrade the room for me (see the picture), so why not upgrade when I am staying? Do I need to spend money to be cheated once more to upgrade? The only advantage of the hotel is the attitude of the restaurant service staff. If you need service and hygiene, it is not recommended to stay.

Speaking of giving a bear to make the child have an unforgettable memory, tell me that this is not always given, I would like to ask if your hotel will treat each person separately? Don't you need a bear for 5 nights and 0 demand? After reading the comments, the adults gave it to the little bear, and there are 2 children who are gone. Co-authors in their 20s, 30s and 40s need dolls to accompany them, but the children need to be independent and will not live anymore.

This rotten banana has a sequel...
Service: Manager Wang is really good. He is righteous and doesn't apologize even when he scolded the customer. The manager at the check-out was also very good. He only apologized and would not solve the problem. He was used to shielding his colleagues.

Dare to ask, the managers of this Conrad, can you let customers finish a sentence, open their mouths and shut their mouths, they will be angry, and if you can’t control your mood, don’t be in the service industry.

Hygiene: Small pieces of paper in the room, Band-Aids in the gaps of the sofa, your cleaning is also meticulous enough.

When the manager arrives at the employee, he will not talk about his bad attitude. He looks like he can't do anything about it. See you soon.

msg:A very comfortable stay experience. This time I took my children on a business trip and chose a hotel with convenient transportation and comfortable environment as the first choice. On the edge of the Third Ring Road, it takes less than 10 minutes to walk from Sanlitun. One day before check-in, Bob of the hotel contacted the check-in needs in advance, and was very satisfied with the arrangement of the room's landscape location, and the area in the room was reasonably separated. The service staff in all positions of the hotel are very active and enthusiastic. The restaurant has tasted both Chinese and Western food, and each has its own merits. Although it is a little expensive, it is better than the environmental service. The breakfast is rich in variety and five-star standard. Overall, I am very satisfied with this stay. Thank you very much [baoquan][baoquan]

After taking a shower at night, the hair dryer was broken The socket in the bathroom is broken and the hair dryer can't be brought in. The two phones in the room are silent.

🍃Environment: The carpet outside the room is dark and dirty. I can't imagine that such a hotel can be called a designer hotel. The executive room is more than 1,900. I really dare to sell it
 
To be honest, the breakfast is really hard to describe. Except for the black tea, there is nothing wrong with drinking it. It may be difficult to adjust the taste. But I really hope that the dishes can be adjusted. After all, I have lived in and experienced it myself. I didn't want to post this comment, but I hope you don't step on the pit again. In short, I won't choose this hotel again in the future! Of course, I also hope that the Conrad Hotel will be improved and the business will be better in the future! Don't let your guests down!

It is very convenient to go everywhere, and the scenery is not bad. For the room, I would like to thank the butler, Bob, who arranged the room for us in advance. The scenery is unique. I personally like the Conrad windows. They are very unique! In the restaurant where you eat in the morning, the sun shines on the huge floor-to-ceiling windows and then reflects on your body. While enjoying the sun and eating breakfast, the mood becomes wonderful! Because of Bob’s warm and professional service, I feel that this is the best hotel I have stayed in Beijing, and I recommend everyone to go!

In addition, because I have been to the wedding anniversary, the room has special small decorations, and small cakes are also given. Tuanjiehu Park and the street view can be seen directly outside the window, and the overall feeling of the room is great. In addition, it was the first time for breakfast to encounter a queuing situation, but the service, food and environment were good, so it also offset the small unpleasantness when queuing. It is worth mentioning that Ctrip's service, because the room rate on the day of check-in is lower than when booking in advance, so I tried to communicate with Ctrip's customer service, and the difference was refunded. Therefore, I feel very satisfied with the hotel itself and Ctrip's service this time. I will come to stay at ease next time~

It is hard to imagine that a designer hotel with a price of 1600+ uses a smart toilet, not even a flush that can be directly installed on the wall, but the side knob of the toilet that is used like a 200+ hotel, and it is also Can't wash it down...2. The shower in the shower room is too low. If you don't want to use the overhead shower, you can only wash it with your hands. The water pressure is so great that it hurts to rush to the body, and I can't adjust different gears. If it is hung on the wall, it will directly flush to the shower door. Under the action of strong water pressure, it is inevitable that water flows everywhere at the bathroom door. 3. The most strange is the phone on the bedside. The handset can’t be dialed up when you pick it up, and there is no hands-free button, only line1 and line2. It was difficult to hear the other party's voice after dialing out, and told me that there was a silent phone beside the bed, and the voice phone was on the desk? ? ? What is the hotel doing with silent phones? ? Inexplicable... 4. Now everyone in hotels likes to order takeaways. It is understandable not to let the takeaways go upstairs, but there are hundreds of robots that can be used in hotels. There is no such expensive hotel, so I can't help them. Can guests only go down to get them if they change their pajamas?

msg:The appearance of the hotel is very unique, particularly conspicuous by the third ring road, and also very artistic. The hotel is very close to Sanlitun. It is very convenient for eating and shopping. It is also close to the subway station and the transportation is convenient. There is also a free park opposite the hotel, the park is very large and there is a lake, it is very pleasant to stay quiet. The hotel rooms are clean and spacious. I especially like Bob, who is the guest relationship. He is very good and very helpful in all aspects. The feedback that needs help is very professional and timely. Will choose this hotel next time.

msg:The night before our stay, the hotel staff called in advance to inform all kinds of precautions, asking if there are children, and if there are any special needs, very considerate! On the day of check-in, we were still at the scenic spot, and the hotel staff called and said that we had prepared gifts and fruits and were waiting for us! As soon as I entered the gate, the staff were very enthusiastic and polite! When they walked into the room, the children were very happy, with delicious fruits and little dolls from the hotel! The concierge was very attentive and took packaged children's body lotion and shampoo for the children, and added a small bed for the children. Because we are going to the scenic spots and will be back late, we specifically told us to delay check-out. The other party agreed very politely. In short, the experience of this hotel is very good in the past few days in Beijing. Thank you Bob team for giving me home. Bring a warm journey!

msg:This time I specially checked in the Conrad Hotel, Hilton's high-end brand, in Beijing. The summary is: super! The location of the hotel is very good, close to the bustling area of the capital, it is very convenient to go everywhere, whether it is a taxi or subway. The decoration style of the hotel belongs to the feeling of being hidden in the city. As soon as you enter the lobby, you feel the low-key luxury but stylish feeling. I like it very much. The main color of the room is white, which matches well. Especially the room area is very spacious, which is quite large in the surrounding hotels of the same type. The hotel rooms have big windows and there are no obstructions around, so the scenery is very good. In general, it's great value for money and it's worth checking in.

The decoration style of the room is bright and generous, and the warm light comes in particularly cozy. The location of the bathtub in the room is very good, just by the window you can soak in a hot bath while listening to music. The overall layout and hygiene of the room are also very good and very meticulous. The hotel service is also very good. The guest-relationship Bob is cordial and professional, which makes us feel at home and will stay next time.

msg:For this trip to Beijing, I chose Conrad Hotel
This journey is very happy and enjoyable
After we finalized the hotel plan, our colleague Mr. Bob immediately got in touch with me.
Since the day of our check-in is our anniversary
So I also told the hotel briefly when I made the reservation. I thought it would be nice to have a simple arrangement of furnishings.
But this stay experience service and arrangement really moved us
With Mr. Bob’s and colleagues’ arrangements in advance, we had a very good check-in experience when we arrived at the store, which also added a lot of surprises to this anniversary.
The last thing is to compliment the hotel’s breakfast. You must buy this breakfast when you check in. The quality and style are very rich and delicious.
Thanks again to the hotel colleagues for the perfect staying experience for us this time

msg:The whole hotel feels dilapidated and in disrepair. After staying for three days, I encountered a series of problems. As a traveler who frequently stays in hotels in major cities, I really feel that this hotel is sorry for the Conrad brand. The entire Hilton Group has regressed.
1. On the first day I checked in, I found that there was always running water in the toilet. After calling a maintenance worker to deal with it, the leak stopped.
2. The TV background wall of the room has the background light flashing all the time, which makes it impossible for people to fall asleep normally. At 11:30, the maintenance worker came to cut off the power.
3. The light buttons are messy, and the actual function does not match the label.
4. There is no USB plug in the room. The interface of the music alarm clock is the old version interface of iPhone 1-4. This is the iPhone 12. Apple has been using the lightning interface since the iPhone 5 in 2012, which is 8-9 years old. Is it a high-end five-star hotel that does not even consider charging the residents' mobile phones? The phone asked the front desk to borrow a USB charger, and the answer was no.
5. The phone at the bedside is broken, and the explanatory text shows that the degumming is serious, which profoundly indicates the lack of maintenance, and only the desk phone can be used. The desk seat is broken, unable to adjust the height, seems to have been damaged for a long time.
6. The hotel’s 20*8M swimming pool plus an entire fitness center. The men’s locker room is designed with only two bathing positions. What is surprising is that one of them has been damaged and cannot be used, while the other has water but the water temperature is too high and cannot be adjusted. Everything was not explained in advance; after swimming, my child and I could only wear swimming trunks and towels to go back to the room on the guest ladder, and we were very embarrassed; all of this can be fully prepared in advance, such as preparing guest bathrobes.

Before check-in, the hotel’s customer relations director BOB asked in advance whether there were any special requirements for the room, arranged a high-floor room for me, and carefully prepared small gifts and fruits. Any problems encountered can be resolved in time , The service is really attentive. The check-in and check-out efficiency at the front desk is also very efficient. No breakfast was ordered at the time of booking. If you go to eat temporarily, the price is higher. If you book with the front desk in advance, there will be a discount. Overall, the staying experience is still very good.

After more than 40 minutes, I went downstairs to see that the concierge staff were all idle downstairs and asked me about my bag. I took it out from the front desk. If you don’t give it to you, don’t tell me to bring it to me. I won’t go downstairs. Are you waiting for me to check out and pick it up?

After booking the check-in, he asked about the needs, provided various conveniences after check-in, and took us to the administrative corridor. For the night view of Beijing, in short, it is correct to choose Conrad for this itinerary~

During the stay, the staff also tried their best to meet our requirements, and it is not an exaggeration to say that it is a home away from home. The rooms have high ceilings, high-level views are also good, the beds are soft and supportive, and you can sleep well in the hotel at night. After all, it is a hotel that has been open for a long time, and the various services are attentive and enthusiastic. After staying for three days, we have no worries and can enjoy Beijing City with peace of mind. Conrad can be said to have been included in my top choice for Beijing hotels.

Two days before the check-in, the hotel took the initiative to call to ask if there were any special requirements for the room. After that, Bob from the concierge depar**ent added me to WeChat to facilitate some consultation and communication. Because it was for my husband’s birthday, I asked if I could arrange a higher floor and simple decoration. Bob was very considerate to arrange the rose arrangement and presented cakes and fruits. I am very grateful to Bob👍 for upgrading the room. The service is sincere. Nothing to say. The room view and sanitation are also superb, my husband and I like it very much! Will come to live in the future😍

msg:First of all, the location of the hotel is very good, close to Sanlitun, so it is very convenient to eat and go shopping around; but the hotel is "hidden" in the noisy and quiet location, which is far away from the hustle and chaos of Sanlitun.
The hotel is cost-effective, as a luxury brand of Hilton, but the price is very friendly, and it looks very kind compared to the surrounding peers.
The hotel rooms are large in size and are typical post-modernist styles. The colors are very trendy and pleasing. It matches the unique appearance of the hotel and fits my aesthetics. The hotel rooms are well maintained, especially the windows The bathtub looks at the traffic and neon lights on the Third Ring Road. If you soak in the bathtub with a glass of red wine, it is very pleasant for petty bourgeoisie.
The hotel's various services are also very good, the front desk Bob service is intimate and professional, and he also helped introduce Beijing's niche boutique attractions, making this trip to Beijing pleasant and perfect.

msg:My best friend and I made a temporary move, decided to punch the major five-star hotels in Beijing, pick and choose, and then compare, finally Conrad became our first stop on the trip.
Location: After dinner in Sanqingtan, Sanliyu, we walked all the way to Conrad Hotel with the aim of eating and eating, which took about 15 minutes. The hotel is adjacent to the Third Ring Road, next to the Jiaming Center and the 80th Middle School, and is located across the road from Tuanjiehu Park. The hotel and Tuanjiehu, Hujialou subway station are within 10 minutes walk, for the friends of the foreign trip to Beijing very friendly.
Hotel Service: Bob from the concierge contacted us by phone before we checked in to understand our needs and arrange more detailed service according to our actual situation. In addition to the free upgrade to our room, the surrounding environment, attractions were explained and recommended in detail, very intimate! If the service attitude of the concierge and front desk staff is described by angels, the male staff who checks the health treasure at the hotel entrance may only be called the devil 👿. He was all the way with a stiff face, cold so we sweep health treasure, I immediately took out the mobile phone sweep, because the best friend is carrying a lot of things not to take the mobile phone, delayed to keep up with the rhythm. So I asked him, can I only sweep one person? Silence. So I asked again, only listen to him viciously said: No! ! My best friend and I was shocked in a moment, five-star hotel service is this? In line with the Buddha's principle of understanding, I and my best friend did not intend to pursue, after cleaning the health treasure, we want to go to the toilet, so thick-skinned to ask health treasure brother. I saw that the head of the people not to raise, with his strong arm to the distance, such as gold, stable as "sculpture." I and my best friend here suggested that you, can be transferred to the post to become a bodyguard, just standing there is enough shock.
Breakfast: Conrad's breakfast is perfect, the dining environment is beautiful, as if falling into the magic of Harry Potter world. The food is rich and naughty, hidden in every bookcase, you need to find and find, eat a breakfast and have a little childhood fun of hide-and-seek, a little fun. The breakfast was of high quality, each bread was very soft, and I was eating four of them while controlling the sugar.
Overall, it was a good stay, although there was a trace of dissatisfaction, but it is not overly recommended!

入住期間外賣問題讓我非常生氣 第一天下午點了外賣 溝通後給我工作人員給我送上來了（之前和家人住過北京康萊德酒店 清楚記得簽了食品協議是可以送的）但是第二天一大早上 外賣員説給我打電話説送不了 我説我來溝通的時候 首先我可以保證我的態度沒問題 非常客氣 因為是我請你幫我送上來 但電話對面的酒店工作人員很大聲的跟我喊“女士 我們食品類一律送不了！！”我想請問一大早上剛起床誰願意被人大喊？？我的好態度換來的就是這麼差的服務嗎？大早上的這非常嚴重的影響我的心情 如果有人喜歡早上起床就被人劈頭蓋臉喊一頓可以來住呢 
送不了你可以好好講話 沒必要跟我喊 誰也不是不講理 但是你昨天可以送上來 今天就送不了 非常好笑 如果送不了就所有一律不要送 誰也不是難纏 不講理的人 你們辦事情非常自相矛盾！
房間問題
入住後馬桶一直抽水聲不斷 隔幾分鐘到十幾分鍾抽水聲一次 半夜被抽水聲嚇一跳 我們第一天回酒店是9點鐘左右 第二天從環球影城玩了一天回來已經很疲憊了 因為兩天都是時間在太晚 我們沒有麻煩工作人員來處理！聲音不是不可以接受 但是這個問題我搜了下很多人都有説 大半夜響很影響休息 去年到現在廁所都沒修好嗎 其次電視除了自帶的電影別的節目看不了 盥洗室鏡子的電視所有節目是雪花屏 上個月住過瑰麗 反差實在太大。
但房間是按我要求安排 前一天賓客關係中心有聯繫我需要什麼房型安排 衹有房間安排讓我滿意。
臨走時送了小熊和巧克力 如果是為了發生的事情抱歉我不是不可以接受 
但沒想到加微信和送禮物衹是為了催我寫好評 一下午一直在催 但酒店方能不能想到我不回是也有其他事情 等我問如何寫的要求時沒人理我 太尷尬了 酒店價格不是很高 我不要求服務的到底有多好 但這個態度 平心而論 我不是不講道理的人 我真的不太懂。

入住前一天賓客的Sophia打電話過來確認入住習慣喜好，整個辦理流程絲滑，不耽誤時間。
入住期間出現的小插曲，解決的也非常快。
預約的Chapter下午茶位置沒有定上，就去了大堂的，賓客關係主管Harry以及餐飲經理Amy知道後幫我做了免單處理，還送了好吃的和紅酒，搞得我都不好意思白吃白拿了，哈哈哈。
衝著服務，康萊德還會是我下次出差北京的首選

msg:客服服務特別好，這裏尤其感謝Harry, Annie,fay三位客服經理，非常貼心，這次住了四天每天都有客服經理輪崗關心我在酒店是否舒適，比同檔的酒店的客服服務都要好。因為酒店裝修淺色系，房間沙發看上去有很多瑕疵，但也因為淺色才這樣其實也不是臟。但是三位客服的貼心完全可以忽略掉這些小瑕疵，下次還會選擇住這裏！

msg:北京住酒店多年，康來德應該是高端酒店裡最差、服務最粗糙的，這次入住一定是最後一次。
1、入住前，客服提前電話問我對房間的需求是什麼？我説“高樓層”。欣然答應，讓人感覺服務非常好。深夜到酒店，已是疲憊不堪，前台義正嚴説“沒有高樓層”，一下子給人極其差的體驗。
2、我質疑了預留服務是“假服務”，前台果斷給我換了名義上19樓的“升級房型”，進去後結果是邊角最小的大床房，毫無景觀和採光，甚至房間明顯是很少住客人的“積塵房”
3、我表達了對服務不滿，但因為很疲憊不需要再換房間後。酒店害怕我投訴，在我已經入睡後電話吵醒，美其名曰“給您換全景大床房”。
4、第二天，出於害怕投訴，客服不斷電話、微信、微信語音我，希望給我“解決方案”。但實質上不斷的電話是對我日常工作的“打擾”。然而，酒店空有“補償”的意願，卻連基本的房間打掃都沒做好，衞生間梳粧台的打掃水平是不如一般的三四星酒店的，喝完的瓶裝水也不知道換新。
5、酒店的餐廳服務更是配不上酒店的收費，穿着短袖去餐廳，感受到空調很冷，要求換位置。服務員的態度便是覺得給她添麻煩了，並表示“到哪裡都這麼冷，沒辦法”。
康萊德已不是幾年前的服務水平了，距離麗思、瑞吉、柏悦的服務已經天差地別，可能連萬豪的入門級都夠不上了。

服務：服務很周到，從訂單下達開始就已經感受到了服務的態度熱情，還沒入住，工作人員劉澤昊就已經聯繫到我，還給我房間準備了小驚喜，一衹可愛的小熊➕各種新鮮水果；退房的時候，小哥哥還送給我一個精美的小卡包，可可愛愛

msg:謝謝回訪。

我應該是從前面開始選擇康萊德（上海），第一次入住的時候從前台指引接待到順利入住房間，整體的入住體驗都非常好，staff的專業度非常高！之後的故事就是衹要那天有點累了，不想回家了，工作晚了，就直接康萊德開個房間睡一覺。

去年我在康萊德度過了我最難忘的一次生日，對Conrad這個品牌再一次加深了印象，謝謝。

這次來北京玩兒，還是比較匆忙的，也是沒有做好很好的攻略，什麼地方都沒有預約到，也沒有去自己想去的地方，因為人實在是太多啦。下次來我一定會再次選擇你們，因為這次沒有體驗早餐還有一些其他的設施所以提不出來一些建設性的建議，希望下次時間不趕的時候可以都體驗一下。

Fyi, 下個月底的時候，我會去新加坡，這次依舊是預訂了康萊德，希望能給我驚喜！

房間:標配的鵝絨枕頭睡着超級舒服，不過看好多人都睡不了軟軟的枕頭。床墊也很舒服，問了一下是金可兒品牌的，不愧是奢華酒店。房間的景觀也是很不錯，可以看到團結湖公園，BTW 酒廊的風景視野是全酒店最好的了，沒有之一。

早餐:早餐我是很滿意的，整體的服務與出品都是可以滿足我的需求的。

服務:這一點我要重點説一説了，在到店前有賓客服務主管Harry提前溝通並溝通住店需求，他永遠都是第一時間回覆和及時幫忙處理問題，見面的時候永遠都是笑臉相迎並且可以記住客人的姓氏（這點好多奢華酒店都沒有的哦）住店期間也是一直分享給我們酒店各部門營業時間～

整體住宿體驗超級棒，Harry的服務也是超奢華體驗！推薦指數100顆星！

首先地理位置佔據着很大的優勢，無論打車去哪裡都很近，同時也靠近地鐵站，緊挨着三里屯（喜歡豐富夜生活的夥伴閉眼沖），主打一個鬧中取靜。
其次早餐也讓人很驚喜，在小紅書上看到是網紅的美食圖書館風格，本來還擔心會不會是形式大於口味，但是三頓早餐體驗下來確是名不虛傳，大部分主食是點餐制，中西都有，品類很多，口感都不錯，還有地道的老北京炸醬麪可以嘗試，家人最愛他們家的鮮榨果汁。
最後不得不提一下服務，尤其是賓客服務的Fay和Harry，熱情但不失分寸感，會很耐心的聽取反饋和建議，需要的東西也會很快給到反饋，離店時幫忙退房處理還貼心的贈送了一對小熊和贈品。酒店整體的服務處處可以體現出以客户為中心的酒店文化和服務宗旨，效率也極高，有一次因為走路 太多腳破了流血，酒店也是在五分鐘之內就送來了一大堆清理傷口的葯物，非常貼心了。
酒店雖然是2017年開的，但是看的出維護的很好，簡約風格，但是功能性卻很好，其實北京大部分高星級酒店運營的年數都不短，所以這家總體來説已經比較新了。值得體驗。以後有機會去北京，應該還會繼續選擇這家。

酒店房間還是有年代感的，水龍頭熱水要開很久才熱，馬桶的按鈕必須手動按到位才可以，不然就一直漏水。電吹風還以為是dyson，結果是徠芬哈哈。

床和枕頭很不舒服，稍微翻身整個床墊都在晃動。

按金不是秒退到賬，住四晚收了2500，説需要等1-3個工作日，目前還在等待。

地理位置很好，地鐵站以及公共設施都很便利。商場購物也很方便，早餐很好也很有質量，我最愛吃的是班尼迪克蛋。
前台禮賓總機的服務態度都很好，也都很熱情好客對客人。酒店的設施設備雖然開業十餘年，但房間的維護是可以的，整體也是很喜歡的裝修，大堂因為臨近新年了，全部都是中國年氛圍，很喜歡的酒店之一。

酒店賓客關係部門還提前電話溝通對房型和房間朝向的傾向，告知暖氣調節的小細節，可以説是細緻入微。
也有小問題，比如淋浴的花灑有點怪……整體瑕不掩瑜。

剛在攜程上預訂好就主動加了我微信，詢問到店時間和偏好，讓人感覺非常貼心。每天也都會跟進一下今天的服務狀況，詢問是否有可以幫忙的地方，非常細節。過程中因為我朋友腰傷了，康萊德也有硬板床的選項，讓我朋友安穩的度過了三個晚上。

入住送的歡迎水果，還送了我們兩個小蛋糕，口味也非常不錯～走之前還試了一下陸羽的中餐廳，粵菜出品穩定，口味不錯，但是桌墊感覺可以改進一下。

謝謝客户關係這邊的Fay，Annie和Harry，服務確實很貼心，下次來北京應該還會選擇康萊德～

1. 晚上7點入住 高峯時間居然衹有一個人辦理入住 排隊等了好久；
2. 離開的時候找禮賓部處理一件小事 服務態度惡劣 讓人各種膈應；
3. location真的太差 周邊低端住宅區 啥商場吃的都沒有。

作為攜程老用户 切記 附近隔壁就是瑰麗 真沒必要到這

在辦理入住之前有賓客關係主管Harry和melody和我們溝通入住需求，到店之後有在大堂迎接和問候，讓在外旅行的客人很有歸屬感以及温暖。在住店期間我有提出過一些需求Harry也都盡心盡力的幫忙在協調服務和及時分享給我，儘管北京同類型奢華品牌數不勝數，但北京康萊德的服務在我這裏我覺得是TOP 1，不止是因為他們有幫助我一些事情，而是整體的服務人員水平都很在線，都是有主動服務意識的，這個在現在感覺很難得。
退房之後Harry也有幫我們存行李和預約車子，並詢問航班號碼告知我們幾點出發比較合適比較穩妥不會在機場趕，因為我們在大興機場很遠[破涕為笑]
城市景觀:房間的景色真的很好！
房間設施:非常舒適
洗護用品:BYRDEO的全套，味道是我超級喜歡的！
整體推薦:五顆星

服務有些一言難盡，trip.com上明明寫着可以接受visa付款，下單後打給酒店確認，預訂部竟然表示沒聽過這個選項？！然後説轉線給前台，也等了好久沒人接…服務員普遍都不大想搭理人的感覺，與預期中的五星酒店服務有所偏差

要不是在攜程定了兩天，我到房間就想走人了
首先，前台服務態度不好愛答不理的，連我老公都説不怎麼樣
還有就是真的很舊很舊
進房間一股子潮味兒，簡直了
洗手枱這些也非常老舊
床頭插頭居然是松的！真的是大無語！1800多的酒店就這樣哦？
無奈了，住了兩天果斷搬四季了。
四季是沒有問題的，雖然時間也挺久的了，但是她維護的還不錯。
服務人員到位的！康萊德你們不能光一個外觀設計吧？
裝修一下吧，真的沒辦法住

1、晚上打服務電話和房間電話根本沒人接！一直沒人接！
2、如果第一條，有人説太晚了人家也要休息，那白天打服務電話也沒人接！是怎麼回事？
3、定了行政大床房，給一個角房，房間大小非常逼仄。聯繫換房，電話打不通，換房極慢…

為酒店服務手動點贊，客房打掃的人員看到沙發有被子，等我們遊玩回來，主動問我們要不要鋪沙發，確實可以看出員工都很有服務意識。
酒店中餐廳口味不錯

在酒店窩着吧…好的星級酒店一定要有完善的星級
設施和自己的特色點，康萊德雖然是10年的老酒店
了不過基本的設施保養的都還可以。
•回推薦點：當然是一樓的圖書館餐廳了，與其
他
酒店的自助早餐相比在圖書館餐廳吃頓早餐還是挺有趣的，酒店外國人比較多所以特別淮備了老北京
炸醬麪和特色的中式點心；
南包推薦點：房問的空間大，分區也很明確，床品和浴巾毛巾也都很厚實很舒服；
酒店的健身房和泳池都在地下，雖然空間不
小
但在地下總感覺特別憋屈相比之下還是喜歡户外的泳池。
總體來説酒店整體性價比還是可以的，地理位置的優勢去哪都很方便，酒店裡也就幾家不錯的餐廳和下午茶要是來北京旅行公出還是不錯的選擇的。

msg:還是我，那個寫了超長差評並且附帶視頻+照片的客人。兩間房都是我下的單，剛剛忘記説另一件事了。

去之前酒店就打電話來問“幾點入住，有什麼特別要求”
我説“大床房入住的男士是我們老闆，儘量給他安靜一點的房間，我們雙床房沒有特殊要求啦！當然如果可以送水果最好了”
酒店掛斷電話後還加了我微信，説是有事及時聯繫。

電話那頭態度賊好，答應了兩件事：
1，送大床房免費升級
2，送水果

但結果是是：
1，並沒有升級（我詢問了入住的男士，房型大小一模一樣）
2，第一天兩個房間都沒有水果。

然後所謂的“有事微信及時聯繫”真的非常“及時”呵呵！
由於辦理入住時非常不愉快，我當晚就發微信給他們反映了，結果等到第二天中午都沒有任何迴應，我一氣之下刪了微信，忘記截圖了……所以衹剩一張通訊記錄。
然後第二天下午16.00多吧，另一位女性工作人員帶着水果、蛋糕來道歉。可當時我由於前一晚通宵忙，正在補眠…………對，我起床氣啊……我説我不接受……其實她好像很無辜……好吧 對不起她！

但是，北京康萊德真讓人失望！
