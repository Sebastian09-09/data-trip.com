msg:I chose this hotel with my friends on a double date.
It is strongly recommended to drive there. First, there is really no bus in the geographical location, and it is quite desolate, so you can only drive there. Second, it is really a driving experience to drive all the way from the city of Yixing! You can feel the winding mountain road, but it is very stable and easy to drive👍very fun to drive~

The main feature is that there are logos everywhere, and the Lamborghini logo is everywhere hhh
In fact, the hotel area is not as large as some similar wild luxury hotels, but the driving road is a detour, so you still have to call a club car to travel
We arrived a little late, and it was winter. The swimming pool was not open and there was nothing good to take pictures of. This hotel is still more recommended to come in summer. It will feel great

The room terrace is very large. It was a surprise to see a sky full of stars on the terrace at night! I haven't seen stars in many years living in the city😭The dining is good. We had dinner and a buffet breakfast. The yogurt in the breakfast was delicious🤤We ate a lot of cans!

The butler will add WeChat in advance to establish contact, and the reply is also very fast and timely, which is worth praising!

The place is a bit remote and suitable for those who drive by themselves. , otherwise it would be inconvenient to go out.

The scenery can see the lake view, but the lake water is less, 🌄 cannot be photographed
The hotel's recreational facilities include helicopters and horseback riding, indoor children's playground, outdoor swimming pool, indoor cinema, table tennis, etc. There are tea stalls in every place.
Helicopters need to be booked in advance. The captain and co-pilot are handsome, skilled, and the scenery in the sky is good. The experience is very good!
Horseback riding is divided into big horses and short-legged horses. No reservation is required. The short-footed horse and a big brown horse are very obedient, and you can also feed carrots.
The outdoor swimming pool is open for a short time, because it is very sunny during the day, so only 🌅 is suitable for 🏊🏻.
The hotel has two restaurants, among which the Roasted Bird restaurant is open on special days and weekends. The dishes in the restaurant are delicious, large in quantity, and good in service. There are all kinds of stalls for the buffet breakfast.
Because they are all villas, battery cars are needed to get around. The drivers are very polite, enthusiastic, and highly praised.
The front desk service is also good, but the rafting service in the package I bought didn't notify me, and I didn't experience it.
A comfortable travel experience.

Waking up early on the terrace to see the smoky mountains from a distance, taking a walk on the mountain road after meditating, and then going to have breakfast, a wonderful day begins.
Since it was a rainy day, I couldn't experience the horse farm. I drank tea and chatted in the Yunshe tea room, and watched the creation of the purple sand pot. It was relaxing and comfortable.
Walking around lazily and casually, although the swimming pool on the mountainside did not catch up with the afterglow of the setting sun, it also has a unique charm where the water and the sky meet.
Wash your lungs and sort out your mood.

Service: pick up and drop off on call, butler WeChat service is very timely for various needs

msg:If considered a high-end resort hotel, the hotel is pretty good. The place is large and the surrounding environment is beautiful. However, the hotel is positioned as a luxury hotel. If you price it according to this, it is not worth it and you can only give a very low score. First of all, the hotel is very remote. There is nothing around. It is impossible to order takeout at night. Unlike Xishan where there are commercial facilities and places to go shopping. If you stay here, be prepared to spend the night. It is really very busy at night. Bored, can't do anything. Secondly, there are facilities in the hotel. The luxury hotel does not have double indoor and outdoor swimming pools, only outdoor swimming pools. It is nice to look at. In this season, it is just decorations. There are very few fitness equipment, only two spinning bicycles. If you are taking your kids, the parent-child paradise is also ridiculously small. I guess the theater has just been renovated, but the smell of paint is still very strong inside and I can't stay there at all. The hotel service staff are not professional enough. In addition, I suggest the boss to understand the linens of luxury hotels. The sheets are all wrinkled. It will affect your mood when entering the room. It is not that you have high requirements. After all, you are already targeting the Ritz-Regis. For a hotel like Hanbi Tower, there shouldn’t be any wrinkles in the linen of any hotel at this price. The variety of breakfast in the restaurant is also pitiful, and it is even less than the buffet breakfast provided by comfortable hotels... If you really want to set this price, I suggest the boss improve it. If you pay more than 2,000 for your place, it will be a luxury type. The racecourse is still fun to play. If you want to go there for the scenery, you can go to the racecourse instead of staying there. The whole family can really count the stars together that night.

The hotel covers an area of 600 mu, which is a scenic spot in itself, but because of the new opening and the epidemic, there are not many people, and some facilities are not fully operational. The room is named after the constellation. This time I stayed in the one-bedroom villa of Leo. The experience is very good. You can enjoy the mountain view while lying on the bed. The room is also equipped with a large terrace. Unfortunately, because of the rain, I couldn’t see the stars.

The service of the hotel staff must also be 👍, very enthusiastic. Although many facilities in the hotel have not been developed this time, it is not a pity. In the future, there will be an exclusive horse farm and an amusement park for children🎠, looking forward to the launch soon! The room is very clean and a**ospheric, and it is exactly the wild luxury style I want! emphasize again! Their restaurant is really good. The dishes are very nice and worth visiting. In short, it is worth visiting and checking in. I will choose this hotel next time.

msg:The hotel is generally good. I have nothing to say about the environment. The layout of the room is not very reasonable. The two-bedroom is actually separated into two separate houses, and there is no connecting living room or something, which loses the meaning of the two-bedroom. In addition, due to the trial operation, the supporting facilities are too lacking. Except for the swimming pool, there is nothing else, and the restaurant only has three meals in the morning, noon and evening, and there are not many choices of dishes. The service also needs to be improved. First of all, stop at the entrance of the reception hall. The doorman will take care of each other, and only respond when asked 😂 Even the simplest cleaning of the guest room has to be reminded before cleaning, and the balcony is also ignored.

msg:Based on the brand and price, the hotel service is not professional. Although it is in the so-called trial operation, the existing service is not high-end and exquisite. There is no knock on the door in the morning. I asked the hotel to put things in special paper bags for the hotel, and the hotel said no... This should be the standard configuration of ordinary hotels. It is a very basic item configuration in the application of the brand vision system. There is no configuration in the hotel, which is too exaggerated... This place is very difficult to do DiDi. I asked the hotel if they could help deliver or call Didi to do an emergency nucleic acid test. After looking at it, it was only a driving distance of less than 10 minutes, but The hotel refused decisively. If there are many guests, I can barely understand it, but there are obviously very few guests... In conclusion, although it is a trial operation, the experience is really bad, and I will never come back. At the same time, I thought of a hotel that had just opened for trial operation next to Yangcheng Lake last year. Although some projects have not yet started, the service and experience of the hotel are really much better than this one, and the price and scenery are really much better.
I really don't recommend it. Of course, I also hope that this hotel will be officially opened later, and it can do a good job.

有幾點建議改進哈 
1. 套餐裏是有贈送旅拍的 實際到店告知旅拍工作人員請假了 明確反饋如果有的話希望安排 但在最後一天離店的時候 看到攝影師給其他家庭拍攝了 這個在服務裏的疏漏是非常明顯的 套餐安排的服務沒有兑現 也沒有補償 而且實際後面是有人的.
2.我們住的房間熱水器是有問題的 淋浴的水龍頭温度從微冷到適中到微燙 無限循環 嘗試好幾個方法都無果，所以後來給娃洗澡就用浴缸的淋浴器了.
3.名曰水療度假酒店 硬件上有無邊泳池 有露天温泉的場地 説明在設計的時候是想要一年四季提供服務的 實際清明假期到店的時候 兩個都關着 衹提供參觀 這個真的非常非常可惜.

msg:1688購買了兩晚。
首先是不滿意的一些點：
1. 酒店房間是瓷磚地板，冬季比較冷，個人喜歡地毯，地毯的清潔也更能體現酒店的清潔能力，由於不是地毯，還是比較失望的
2. 空調有兩個控制器，全部開到風最大，最高温加電輔熱，温度依然不夠暖，對於帶娃的家庭不是很友好。即便是温度加不上來，開了兩台空調室內還是乾燥，建議加配加濕機提高入住體驗。
3. 洗澡的水壓不足，在水龍頭那看起來還可以，到花灑就不行了。
4. 餐廳的口味很差，應該説是非常差，早餐是包含的，能吃飽就好了，麪檔的牛腩麪我覺得不錯，其他就真的不怎麼樣。 晚餐飲價格高，擺盤是講究的，但口味明顯不符，但給我的感覺是，餐飲的定價單純衹是為了匹配酒店的定位，而不是因為口味好而定的高價。好在送了一份羊肉湯勉強湊合了一頓，羊湯應該是半成品，外賣買回來的熟食加上一包湯料和一點黃芽菜（白菜）加上枸杞和紅棗，煮開就可以上桌。。。實在是沒法吃，其他菜又貴，在知道菜品素質不匹配的前提下，一家四口根本沒法點。
5. 房間內沒有準備一些基本的餐具，買了草莓水果沒地方放，價位低的蘇州蘭博基尼就準備了很多，實用多了。
6. 退房當天，按説明是12點前退房，但房卡會在9點到10點間就失效，我們一家（孩子3歲和5歲）在0度寒風中等待了20分鐘無法入屋，送房卡的工作人員一臉嚴肅，並不覺得是工作的疏忽，無任何歉意。
7.  一個不是很重要的點，蘇州蘭博基尼裏的電吹風是dyson的，為什麼價格更高的宜興蘭博基尼是雜牌電吹風
8. 酒店房間的景觀應該是靠北邊的更好，入住前提醒要安排一間景觀好的（淡季，住不滿，這個要求是可以做到的）但酒店安排是最南邊的景觀真的一般，露台外看的是餐廳屋頂

好的點：
酒店的確整體風格很適合度假，視野開闊，有茶園，馬場，還有燒烤的地方，泳池看起來也不錯，但的確不適合冬季，冬季在酒店的確做不了什麼。但夏季和秋季價格也會非常高。
宜興這塊作為旅遊度假區來説，其實做的很初級，我們去了御水温泉，但這個地方還是十幾二十年前的概念，一羣人在寒風天裏換着不同的熱水泡澡，反覆的移動，高温的温泉並不適合小朋友，硬説出來的功效，不如實打實的硫磺浴來的實在。休息區，特別不滿意小童遊樂區，敷衍的設施，昏暗的燈光，處處體驗了店家的不專業和敷衍態度。
在這裏不能吃到美食，是旅遊度假區的最大敗筆，整體不講究口味，旅遊度假區的賣點不以美食為重點，我認為是極大的誤區，這裏的飯店衹是為了賺錢，刷大眾點評評分，十幾餐飲的體驗是0分。
建議的遊玩方式，自駕，騎行，徒步，酒店發呆。餐飲方面，整個旅遊區都不會好，所以簡單方便吃飽就好，不要多花冤枉錢。

msg:房間落地窗很棒，可以觀看自然景觀，樹海與雲湖撲面。
但相比於房價，幾個服務模塊一般，一是餐廳質量一般，價格高就罷了，關鍵是菜品質量實在一般，無法和連鎖酒店相比。
服務質量方面，整體 ok，但離店的時候鬧的很不愉快，接待時笑臉相迎，離店時漫不經心。

房間坐落於山坡上，室內很大很乾凈，從陽台可以眺望遠方，風景棒極了。
早餐雖然不夠豐富，但是非常健康新鮮（説實話我還是很挑剔的），但是做的精緻美味，這樣也避免了浪費。
簡直一次特別棒的體驗。

但可能因為還在試運營期間，硬件細節不到位，具體在房間內部全無裝飾，公區各種施工材料隨意堆放，餐廳洗手間小廚寶整個暴露在外面，遮都不遮一下。

裸心谷是業主，我對蘭博基尼酒店集團不很熟悉，但看上去不像蘇州那家的風格，倒是和裸心集團一脈相承。管理也偏國產風格，影院可以包場播放，座椅幕布都很專業，音響一般，不過四顧無人，所有服務僅限自助，空調要自己開，連瓶水都要微信聯繫客服送來。早餐10:30立即收完，之前問都不問一聲客人是否拿完。網紅泳池這個季節全然是擺設了，制服像抹布一樣的阿姨態度的確熱情。

從南京機場直接過來，因為下着雨，比預計的時間稍晚，酒店下午茶時間為14:00~16:30，到達時候恰好已經到16:30了，酒店管家還是非常貼心的幫我們預留了下午茶點，並提前辦好的房卡，讓咱們一到達直接去享用了下午茶。還貼心的贈送了當地碩大的黃桃和麪包小點心。當地的黃桃特甜、特新鮮，甚為喜愛！
餐廳的男主管服務非常周到和專業，為我們介紹了周邊的環境和推薦附近的餐飲特色，第2天早上過來用早餐的時候，又再次見到他，依然是彬彬有禮，服務周到。
餐廳環境超級棒，還有一個無邊網紅泳池，因為下雨就顯得尤為安靜的美。
