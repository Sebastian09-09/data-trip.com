The terrace looks out at the green trees and water, which makes me feel relaxed. There are also many things for children in the hotel, such as cute pets, picture book library, handicrafts, and amusement park. In particular, the service of Meilan, the staff of the amusement park, is also very good. Including the attitude of other service staff in the hotel. I will go there again next time. I just want to say that this trip is worth it!

msg:It was a perfect trip for Children's Day! It was drizzling, and the whole hotel was shrouded in fresh green. The breeze was not dry, and the sun was just right. A stream passed through the hotel, flowed into Yanzhu Lake, and entered Xin'an River.

Thanks to the housekeeper Xiao Wu, the service was warm and thoughtful, and we answered all the questions. The mountain view room upgraded us to a river view room for free, full of gratitude! I took the children to Guagua Paradise, and the children were so crazy that they forgot to bring water. I tentatively asked Xiao Wu if he could send two bottles of water. Xiao Wu immediately agreed, and soon, two bottles of water were delivered.

It's just that the business is too good. The restaurant was a bit chaotic when I had breakfast in the morning, and there was no seat after waiting for a long time. The food had to be grabbed, but fortunately, the plate was replenished quickly.

The Xin'an Greenway at the entrance of the hotel is really great! I strongly recommend that you bring your children's bicycles and take a journey through the secret realm.

The environment is really good, full of green, which is the most relaxing color for me. The most important thing is that although it is in the mountains, there are no mosquitoes.

Although it's really far to drive to the hotel, the hotel's thoughtful service makes people relax. The housekeeper Jingwen gave us a five-star rating and introduced the hotel's special activities early on, reminding us to make reservations in advance. Although we couldn't go to the mountains to catch insects due to weather reasons, the children were also very happy. It's a little regretful, come again next time!

msg:The scenery of the resort hotel is very beautiful. When it rains, it has the hazy beauty of rain, and when it is sunny, it has the beauty of the rosy clouds. The housekeeper Chen Kaixin is very considerate. She called and added WeChat on the day of arrival, provided the electronic map of the hotel and the guide to play. She was also there when I checked in, handled it professionally, and sent an extra piece of fruit. Helped to carry the luggage and sent us to the door of the room. My family and I felt great.
There is a balcony when the room opens the door. Our tatami room can see the Fuchun River, which is refreshing. There are also many play areas for children, such as the amusement park, the Hobbit Village, the stream water, the ranch, and feeding small animals. We took the baby to the hotel for a deep reading tour, and we went back and forth for several rounds.
The hotel is also very convenient for eating, and the cost-effectiveness is very high. The buffet dinner is 299 for two adults and one child. It has everything you need, and there is also a pick-up area for children, which is very considerate. I had two lunches at Yelu. Every dish was delicious, the fish head was very delicious, and adults and children could order what they wanted.
We only went to the Yanzhou Ancient City among the nearby scenic spots. You have to see it together with the history, otherwise it is just a very homogeneous ancient city, nothing special. The main reason for this trip is to use the hotel as a tourist attraction. This hotel is worth a deep tour.
Finally, we took photos and checked in. The children threw them into the amusement park, and the adults took photos. It was very photogenic, awesome, and excellent. It was a very happy trip.

msg:This time I went to Jiande for vacation and booked the Fuchun Fangcaodi Resort Hotel. As soon as I entered the lobby, I felt very comfortable and the decoration was very artistic. Then the handsome housekeeper Liu Ziliang received us and checked in. We booked a river view room, mainly for daydreaming, so we consulted Manager Liu. Manager Liu was very enthusiastic to help us change to a tatami room with a better river view. We were very satisfied and happy. When getting on and off the shuttle bus, Manager Liu helped us carry our luggage and his work attitude was very serious. During the conversation, I found that Manager Liu Ziliang was very familiar with the business, knew the location of each room well, and was always concerned about our needs. He is truly a high-quality talent in the service industry. I feel that the hotel itself is a tourist attraction. When you go out, you can see the Fuchun River. The houseboats in the hotel are very beautiful. The hotel's Wild Donkey Chinese Restaurant is also very delicious. I recommend fish head soup and local river shrimp dishes. In general, I am very satisfied with this vacation and will stay there next time

msg:Let me start with the advantages: The frog-themed room is very suitable for family stays, and children like the bunk beds with slides very much. There are picture books, furniture and toiletries specially prepared for children in the room. The hotel also sent fruits, free drinks and snacks. The corgi we brought with us stayed for free and received a pet gift bag. The butler service is very reliable, the response is quick, and the attitude is also very good.

The surrounding environment is beautiful, especially suitable for summer play, with an infinity pool and streams for fishing and creek tracing. There are many hotel shuttle buses, which are convenient to use at any time. The overall hotel is not big, suitable for walking and relaxing. It is recommended to have a fishing lake view room, which has a better view and location, and the price is cheaper than the boat house. The parent-child room is located on the hillside and needs to be taken by shuttle bus.

Disadvantages: The quality of the food is very poor, especially the dishes in the Chinese restaurant, which are biased in taste and expensive. The main parent-child hotel lacks dishes suitable for young children in the children's meal, the breakfast buffet has limited options, and the single portion of noodles is pitifully small. Except for the tofu buns, other foods are disappointing and unappetizing. There are no other dining options around, which is a problem.

The hygiene needs to be improved. The paper lamps on the counter of the hotel lobby, which is the facade, are already covered with dust, and some are even about to fall off, but no one seems to notice this problem. The room is in very poor hygiene. The spider webs in the corner of the balcony have not been cleaned for a long time. There are many small debris on the floor of the room, and the space under the bed where children can play is even more dusty. It is black and has hair when wiped with a paper towel. The curtain rod of the wardrobe fell off in the morning, but fortunately it did not hit anyone. These problems greatly reduce the stay experience.

I hope it can be taken seriously so that it can match the beautiful environment here.

msg:I don't know how Ctrip selected this annual parent-child hotel. I can only say that the expectations were too high. The hotel environment is indeed okay, but there are more hotels of this type now. Many things in the hotel don't seem to be big, but they affect the evaluation. A hotel doesn't even have its own parking lot. The public parking lot at the door says that the hotel is not responsible for vehicle accidents, which makes people uncomfortable. It seems that cars outside can park in. All cars have to pass through the hotel lobby to get to the parking lot, and there is even a traffic jam at the door. The hotel sells sesame cakes at the door for 10 yuan each, which is not a good deal. Those who have played in the Hobbit Village in the hotel should be a little disappointed. Originally, what attracted me most to this hotel was the creek fishing mentioned in the introduction. The hotel store sells fishing nets for 20 yuan each. I went to the Hobbit Village and stared at the creek with my baby for 10 minutes. I didn't see a single fish. I felt that others looked at me with ridicule. I didn't see other activities of catching insects and making specimens. The buffet is 160 per person, which is not expensive, but the quality of sashimi is really average. Breakfast is more than one person on Friday, and you have to go in and find a seat by yourself.

Children's breakfast was provided when checking in, which was previously required to be purchased separately in other hotels (children of 1.5 meters). The hotel service staff is enthusiastic and will respond to any needs.
The scenery is picturesque and the mountains and rivers are beautiful. There is also a walking path on the left hand side of the hotel entrance, which is also great! There are also many activities in the hotel during the May Day holiday, and the a**osphere of camping and singing is full.
The hotel facilities may still be a bit old, and some places are recommended to be replaced, such as the shower in our room; then the peak dining period during the festival actually needs to control the number of people, otherwise everyone will wander around inside, grab seats, grab food, and the dining experience is not very good. I bought a buffet featuring crayfish for dinner, but the crayfish was not available after waiting for a long time, because it was snatched up by 2-3 people as soon as it came out of the pot, so it was difficult to see the restocking.

It was difficult for Qili Yangfan to call a taxi, and Chen contacted and solved it in time. I would like to express my gratitude. The hotel is picturesque and very comfortable without leaving the hotel. I will bring friends back if I have the chance, take a walk and fish. The only thing is that the sound insulation in the room is slightly poor. It will be perfect if it can be improved.

msg:This is a hotel that I will come back to. The housekeeper Xiao Ma provides very thoughtful service.
1. Pet-friendliness: 5 stars
A pet gift bag (urine pad, sausage, etc.) is given upon check-in, and no additional cleaning fee is charged for the room. Dogs can enter the hotel lobby and restaurant (there is a special dining area for pets), and there is also a special dog park (tug-of-war ropes, frisbees, etc. can be rented for free).
2. Play richness: 4 stars
The hotel is built around the mountain, but the area is not particularly large. It takes about 15-20 minutes to walk around the mountain with the dog. There is a small animal park (alpacas, rabbits, sheep, etc.) in the hotel, all in fences, mainly for children, and dogs are not very interested.
If the dog likes to play in the water, there is a place to go in the water, which looks very clean.
There is a 10-kilometer riverside hiking route to the left of the hotel. Motor vehicles cannot enter. It is recommended to walk at night or early in the morning. Dogs can be taken without a leash throughout the journey. Passers-by who occasionally meet like dogs very much (it should be related to everyone's love of the outdoors).
3. Comfort of food and accommodation: 4 stars
The hotel is lush with greenery and there are many insects, but the room is okay and is equipped with mosquito repellent and floral water. However, because the houses are built on the mountain or by the water, it will be a bit humid, which will be relieved after turning on the air conditioner.
The breakfast in the hotel is not bad. We didn't have time to experience the Chinese restaurant and the open-air barbecue in the evening. We went to Fuchun Garden outside the hotel (less than 10 minutes drive) recommended by a friend. If there are two people, it is not recommended because the amount of food is too large [covering face]
In addition, the hotel will provide travel photography services, the first 3 photos are free, and the next one is 80 yuan, the effect is not bad.

The hotel service is also very good. There was a small episode during the Qingming Festival. The only road to the hotel collapsed. We were playing outside during the repair process. When we came back, we found that it was still not repaired. The hotel staff waited for us a few kilometers away from the hotel, arranged for us to park the car and then took us to the hotel by different means of transportation. Although it was a bit inconvenient, the hotel’s positive service attitude is still worthy of recognition.

Butler Wenjing's service is 5 points. Contact us in advance and everything will be arranged properly.
Responded promptly and prepared gifts for the children. Very considerate.
Environment 5 points. The room is big and the balcony is big. The kids had a lot of fun.
There are many shuttle buses and there is almost no need to wait.
The cafe on the top floor is cost-effective and has a beautiful environment

Areas that can be improved
There are too many people in the restaurant and the service can't keep up. It's too difficult to take care of Xiaobao by yourself.
During our stay, the uncle went directly into our courtyard twice. Although we couldn't see inside from the outside, it still felt like a privacy invasion.

The hotel has a unique environment surrounded by mountains and rivers. The housekeeper not only provided warm and caring service throughout the whole process patiently and meticulously, but also gave gifts to dogs and children before leaving.

The environment of the hotel is great. You can feel the fresh air as soon as you get off the car. At night, you can see that there are no stars in the city. During the day, the scenery is beautiful. Walking in the forest is unique. I will travel again next time I have the opportunity.

When we visited Meicheng Ancient Town, we always asked her where to eat, hahaha! The hotel has a lot of activities during the New Year's Eve. I missed the ones during the day but caught up with the fireworks at night. It was very a**ospheric! Next to it is Xin'anjiang, so beautiful! We upgraded to a mountain view room with a terrace, which is great👏🌟

msg:The Fuchun Mountain described by Huang Gongwang is at the core, and it truly deserves its reputation. The hotel is far away from the hustle and bustle of people. Going in the winter off-season will make you feel more clean and comfortable. The environment is very good and the air is very good. The hotel is not particularly big. You can take a slow walk along the main road for exercise. Along the way, there are Hobbit Village and Donglixia. The only shortcoming of the pasture and outdoor children's area is that the trees are withered in winter and it is a little lonely, so the photos are not so photogenic. In addition, there are a lot of bed bugs this season. But fortunately, the enthusiasm of the waiters has not diminished, and I especially praise the housekeeper Xiao An, who helped me while we were on the way. After receiving a call, I was very enthusiastic when I arrived at the store. I took the initiative to upgrade the room type. Seeing that there were elderly people and children in our party, I also helped carry the luggage to the room and gave the children a lot of toys. It was a pleasure to interact with the children. The professional service was great. Full of love, this should be the most important thing about a family hotel.

Walking to the left after leaving the hotel is the Xin'an River Greenway, which is more than 10 kilometers away. On one side is the Xin'an River and on the other side are mountains. The scenery is very good. Ordinary cars cannot drive in, so it is relatively safe. We walked for more than 4 kilometers and came back. , it would be very suitable if you have a bicycle. 3. I think the food in the hotel is quite delicious. The Chinese restaurant, Western restaurant and small noodle shop are all very delicious. 4. There are many fun activities for children. The parent-child park is particularly fun and has a large slide. During New Year's Day, you can also buy fireworks and set them off by the river. The children had a lot of fun. There are also some boating activities that should be more fun, but we didn't go. 5. Xiao Song, the housekeeper, is very enthusiastic and actively responds to questions.
Disadvantages: 1. When approaching the hotel, there are several kilometers of very narrow roads. Once you meet a car, you will have a headache, especially if there are trucks or buses on the opposite side. Novice drivers must pay special attention. 2. There are too few people in the noodle shop. If there are more people, you have to wait for a long time. We waited for half an hour before eating a bowl of noodles. If you want to eat, it is best to ask how long it will take to cook. 3. There are a lot of stains on the walls of the room, especially the sink, etc. It doesn’t look very clean and it’s not easy to clean.

The quiet Fuchun River is just within reach. There is a swimming pool on the top of the mountain, and a cafe is also open. On the right are the mountains, and on the left is a river of spring water. A cup of coffee can last until dusk.
The next day, the housekeeper Xiao Wu also introduced us to the surrounding mountain climbing route map. We had the unique Jiande rice noodles for breakfast at the hotel, and the variety was comparable to that of Marriott!
Thanks to Shanshui, and thanks to the cute little Wu children's shoes. Our whole family and our dogs love them very much, and we will definitely come again.

The hotel has a rich breakfast buffet, and children can choose their own tableware. There is also a self-service area for children, so they will be full.
We had dinner at the Chinese restaurant on the second floor of the hotel. The fish head soup was delicious, but it lacked the seasoning for dipping the fish. The fish alone was tasteless! The vegetables were too oily and bland and not tasty. Generally speaking, the taste of Chinese restaurants is generally recommended for improvement.

msg:At the end of the holiday, let’s take a quick trip. Reluctant to leave. Lakes and mountains, the scenery is pleasant.
Environment: Green mountains and green lakes, birds singing and flowers fragrant. When you open your eyes, you will see a landscape painting. The hotel is designed as a wooden house, close to nature, and feels like living deep in the forest. The only drawback is that the soundproofing facilities are average. The balconies are separated by an interconnecting fence. You can hear the snoring next door in the dead of night😂
Hygiene: The hygiene condition is good and the room is very clean. Meets the standards of a high-end hotel.
Service: The best thing about the hotel is probably the service. Special thanks to the housekeeper Xiao Wu, who upgraded our room type for free and warmly received us. We had a buffet in the evening. Although there were not many varieties, the meat was still delicious. There is an outdoor movie in the evening. It's so nice to watch a movie while ordering some barbecue while enjoying the cool autumn breeze.
Facilities: Suitable for children to play. Especially at the creek in Hobbit Village, there are staff who are there to throw loaches in, which makes the children very happy; there are many shuttle buses, the uncle is very enthusiastic and has good driving skills, and can go to and from the room and the lobby; the best thing is Nothing is more interesting than the swimming pool and cafe. It’s a blockbuster movie just by taking a photo, so you must check in; the small animal feeding is a bit disappointing, the animals are all in cages, a bit smelly, and a portion of carrots is a bit expensive at 36 yuan. Overall, the experience is great
Breakfast: A decent breakfast buffet, not too many varieties but definitely filling. The restaurant can see the boathouse opposite, which will improve your mood throughout the day.
New Travel Photographer: Maybe there were too many people during the National Day, so I didn’t make an appoin**ent, so I’ll save my expectations for the next time!

msg:There is no doubt that the hotel's natural environment and surrounding scenery are great. It is built on the mountain, and the vast Fuchunhui flows in front of you. The hotel is located on the lower reaches of the Fuchun River, not far from the confluence of the three rivers. Since it is built close to mountains and rivers, the fastest way to get there from Hangzhou is to take the Changshen Expressway, then get off the expressway and go upstream along Fuchunhui in the opposite direction. The roads along the river are very narrow in places, so you need to pay attention when driving. Since the hotel is far away from the busy city, it is a good place to retreat and relax, suitable for families. The rooms are small rooms and small rooms built against the mountain. The service staff will drive you to the door on the mountain in a car, and then the whole world will be yours. In short, it is suitable for escaping from the world and fishing.
The hotel's small lake and swimming pool are very photogenic and are a good place to take photos.
I booked the Garden View Courtyard during the National Day holiday, and the butler upgraded me to a river-view room for free. I stayed for two nights in a row. The butler responded to every request. I give it a thumbs up. Overall, the service is not refined enough, and there is a certain gap between it and Kaoye's hotel management. There is no business district around, so it is basically all in the hotel. Finally, there is Xin'an Greenway in front of the hotel, and the bicycle I brought came in handy. It was very interesting to ride 10 kilometers uphill and downhill along the Fuchun River to the dry beach. This is actually the biggest discovery of this trip.

msg:Thank you to staff member Ni Rujun for your help. I usually don't bother to write reviews about hotels, but I have to write about this one. Very good hotel 🏨, because I was traveling with my puppy during the National Day, I specially chose a pet-friendly hotel. There are too few pet-friendly hotels in China, and the quality is also uneven. But I don’t regret choosing this hotel. The hotel is built on a mountain and the environment is very good. I am used to wiping the bedside table with alcohol wipes after staying in the room. As soon as I wipe it, I can tell that the cleaning is very careful. We booked a river-view twin bed with a nice view. Fruits were provided for both days of our stay. We also gave the children breakfast for two days. There is no additional cleaning fee for pets. It is indeed not a hotel that charges extravagantly for everything. Mineral water is also generously provided, which is great in the mountains. The fruit is delicious, and the prune pancakes provided by the hotel are also delicious. The breakfast was rich and the staff was dog-friendly. My half-year-old Shetland dog saw sika deer, alpacas, pigs, horses and rabbits for the first time in the hotel ranch. She was timid, dishy and stubborn. When I went to sniff it out of curiosity, the sika deer turned around in the fence and was so frightened that it rolled down the steps. The most touching thing was that after staying for two nights and just before departure, I found that the suitcase was stuffed into the car and was not flat. The trunk was pressed too tightly, making it impossible to open or close the suitcase lid, making it impossible to set off. With the enthusiastic and patient help of hotel staff Ni Rujun, I finally opened the trunk, put away my luggage, and set off normally. Otherwise, I would have to find a 4S shop in Jiande City to repair the car. Staff member Ni Rujun's serious and responsible behavior and sincere consideration for the guests moved our whole family, and also made my impression of the hotel even better. If I come to Jiande next time, I will choose this hotel again. This is really my favorite The highest rating for a hotel.

Before we arrived at the hotel, the housekeeper called to inquire. After we arrived, Wu Longfei, the housekeeper, kindly introduced us to the hotel's attractions, and any problems were resolved within seconds.
Transportation: Arrive at Jiande Station by high-speed rail, and then take a taxi to the hotel, about 50 one way. It’s easy to get there. But it’s more convenient to drive by yourself. There is a stream in the hotel. If you drive by yourself, you can bring your own washing tools, which will be more fun
Eat: The food in the hotel is okay

msg:On November 11, I wanted to find a place with beautiful scenery to relax, so I found this resort hotel and came here after seeing good reviews. I have to say that the hotel environment is really good, and the facilities are also very complete. There is something suitable for children of all ages. The hotel environment is very quiet. I haven't been able to sleep well since I was exposed to the sun. This time I slept for nine hours for the first time. I haven't had such a good sleep in many years.
The butler Xiao An's service was very good. He called me early that morning to confirm the arrival time and helped make an appoin**ent for the travel photography service. Because I forgot to make an appoin**ent in advance and there were more than 11 people, I almost didn't make an appoin**ent. Xiao An helped with various contacts and the photo shoot was completed smoothly. .
Finally, I would like to talk about the new travel photography, the photos are really beautiful. The children have reached the age where they don’t like taking pictures, but they actually cooperated in taking pictures. When I went home and looked at the photos, everyone said it was beautiful and received unanimous praise.
I will book again if I have the chance. It is really nice to relax on vacation. Next time I plan to go there in the summer, stay for two more days, play in the water under the shade of the trees, have a swim, and take a set of photos by the way, it’s quite nice.

msg:The first night was in a river-view tatami room booked on another platform. The bed was relatively large, which was very convenient for bringing a baby. For the second night, we booked two river-view double rooms through Ctrip. The hotel upgraded us to Fuchun Villa, which has two bedrooms and one living room, one with a double bed and one with a twin bed, both with separate bathrooms, which is very suitable. For a family trip, the balcony is super large. It is very comfortable to lie on the sofa in the living room and look at the river view. Because we had to change rooms, we told the housekeeper Xiao An in advance to help us make arrangements as early as possible. He came over before 11:30 to help us move our luggage and change rooms. It was very efficient! There are footrests for children in the room and in the public bathrooms in the hotel, which is very considerate.
There are quite a lot of activities and entertainment facilities in the hotel, perfect for walking kids, and you can choose to participate according to the activity schedule. The most surprising thing is that the hotel has its own creek, which is near the cute pet paradise. The water is not deep, so you can take your children to play. It is very happy. There are fewer people in the swimming pool on Fridays, so you can go swimming. On Saturdays, it is all private. However, when you go there on Saturday afternoon, there will be bubbles at every half hour, and the children like it very much.
The shuttle bus is quite convenient, but there are many people on Saturdays, so you need to wait a little.
There are not many choices in hotel restaurants, and the Chinese restaurant has a lighter taste. Maybe it is because there are many children, so we take care of the tastes of children and do not follow the taste route of Jiande cuisine. There are 128 seats in the buffet restaurant, and there isn't much. If you want to eat out, you need to drive out.

The housekeeper (Wu Longfei) is very caring, and will communicate in advance on the day of check-in. If there are elderly people, they will give priority to arranging rooms with less climbing. The hotel layout and facilities will be introduced in detail.
Summer is suitable for playing in the water. Catching fish in the creek and the swimming pool halfway up the mountain are children's favorites, especially the swimming pool will make bubbles every once in a while, which is a surprise.
The food and beverages are also good. There are a lot of breakfast varieties, including rice balls with local characteristics, cold noodles, etc. In the Chinese restaurant on the second floor, every dish is a bit spicy. If you don’t like spicy food, you have to be careful. It’s a good deal to use the coupon of 200 minus 50 at the checkout.
This time I chose a two-bedroom room type, which is halfway up the mountain and has good concealment. The first floor is a large living room, and the bedrooms are all on the second floor. You have to carry your luggage up, and the space in the bedrooms is limited, so the suitcases are a bit cramped. The terrace is very large, but this season because of the hot weather and mosquitoes, we can't stay longer.

There is also a children's paradise and a creek. When we finally checked out, the housekeeper Xiao Ding also prepared small gifts and toys for the children! This short trip was fun!

We arrived at the hotel after two o'clock in the afternoon. When we checked in, because the layout of the front desk of the hotel was not very large, there were a lot of people queuing up, resulting in a little queue. We stayed in the room around three o'clock. The housekeeper, Xiao Song, helped us carry the luggage together. Only then did we find out that Xiao Song had upgraded us from a double bedroom with mountain view to a double bedroom with river view. During the stay, it was within reasonable demand. Xiao Song is almost always responsive, which is very grateful. In fact, the room staff are also very hard, cleaning the room with a big bag on the back of the mountain climbing up and down the mountain. Although the cleanliness of the guest room is not up to the corresponding standard, I can understand it, after all, it is really tiring. The driver of the hotel shuttle bus is also very enthusiastic, and it can be seen that the daily workload is indeed quite heavy. There are not many varieties of breakfast in the hotel, some stalls still need to queue up, and the cleanliness of the tableware really needs to be improved. The water in the hotel's infinity pool is quite cold, but there will be bubbles once an hour, and the pool staff are also very serious and responsible. The hotel is actually quite suitable for parents and children, but the cute pet paradise is relatively perfunctory. Cleanliness really needs to be improved.

Let me talk about the disadvantages: 1. The parking lot is open-air, and the scorching sun almost melts the car. The sunshade provided by the hotel can only cover the front windshield of the vehicle, which is basically a drop in the bucket, just a form.
2. The breakfast time is written as 7:00-10:00, but at 10:00 the staff has cleaned up the meals, and the guests who enter near 10:00 basically can’t eat anything. No staff took the initiative to remind.
3. The mountaintop swimming pool is the highlight of the hotel, and it can be called a place with excellent scenery. But the locker room, bathroom, and shower room were filthy. I went there twice in two days and didn't see a single staff member cleaning them. Such hygienic conditions really deviate from the overall positioning of the hotel. This is a major failure of the hotel!

There are creeks, pastures, fishing platforms, lakes, and winding paths in the forest. You can play for a long time in the park alone, and the family likes it very much.

At the beginning, I saw that the rooms were scattered in the forest and I was a little worried about the problem of humidity. After I opened the door and entered the room, my concerns disappeared. The room was very refreshing and clean. The scenery outside the window was lush and lush, accompanied by the singing of cicadas, which made people feel immersed in nature. It was a great surprise that there were no mosquitos living in the forest!

The camping barbecue at night is also very suitable for the stomach. The variety of barbecue is a little less, but the taste is not bad. Watching a movie while eating barbecue, the a**osphere is perfect.

The butler-style service throughout the process is also very considerate, and I will show my heart to the butler Xiao Song.

It's a pity that I couldn't stay here for a few more days, because there were too many beautiful scenery in the hotel that I didn't have time to see. I should bring friends to go again in the future.

The key is that pets can be brought (no pet cleaning fee is charged now), dinner is very cheap, and there is red wine at 128. The only regret is that the upgrade was not successful. Room 956 is not bad, welcome The small biscuits inside the fruit are delicious. The little guy has participated in many hotel activities, making fans, making bookmarks, and making honey~ Pets are kept in captivity. This is not as good as Changxing.

With two dogs, a baby and a mother came to Fangcaodi for a small vacation. On the way to the hotel, I received a call from the housekeeper Lin Xiao, who was concerned. Later, I added WeChat and contacted the housekeeper if I had anything to do. The response was timely, the service was very good, and she was very considerate.
The second brush of Fangcaodi is too friendly for families with children and dogs! Good environment, lots of fun, good service.
This time I also upgraded the room type, prepared fruit, snacks and drinks and other check-in gifts, and gave the children a bag of gifts before leaving.
The swimming pool is outdoor, not indoor. There is an indoor playground for children, Guagua Paradise, where there are quite a lot of fun, and it is also very rich to play in the rain. This time I also passed the picture book hall, and the children watched my sister's handicrafts very fascinated.
This time I went to the cute pet paradise, I felt that the small animals were a bit hungry, and the deer were all skinny. Our last group of tourists bought carrots and vegetables when they saw that there were still leftovers. The animals rushed to eat. still want. I hope the hotel can treat small animals well.
This time the buffet dinner was not very good, not as rich as the previous one.
Fangcaodi is a summer sanctuary for children and pets, and it can be used again.
The Chinese restaurant is good, the quantity is large, the taste is good, and the ingredients are sufficient!

He is very considerate. There is an infinity pool on the top of the hotel. A gift for a big baby and two children 😅 Very cute.

Each room is in the mountain forest, very cozy and comfortable. The hotel's supporting children's facilities can be seen everywhere, which is very convenient and is a large playground for children. The infinity pool on the top of the mountain is really amazing. Lin Xiao who received us was also very enthusiastic and gave us a lot of help and advice. When leaving the store, I also gave a lot of small toys. Will come again in the future.

Unexpectedly, the housekeeper Wang Sutian was super enthusiastic about us. When he saw our family coming, he not only upgraded us to a river view room, We also gave the baby toys, snacks, and fruits as gifts. We feel very lucky and thank Butler Wang for his hospitality. The key point is that the river view room also has a bathtub, so you can take a good bath to relieve the fatigue of the day.

The whole hotel is built according to the mountains and rivers, and the design of many furniture pays more attention to details, which is very artistic, restores nature and has practical functions at the same time. There is another detail that I can’t help but highlight. The smart toilet has a sterilized seal on it, which dispels our concerns about cleanliness.

When I woke up early in the morning and opened the window, I really had a feeling of "the mountains are empty and the rain is also strange". I couldn’t help but take my baby to have breakfast and take a walk in the hotel. The entertainment facilities in the hotel are really rich, and the baby won’t feel bored at all. We rowed together on the lake, went to the amu*****t park to play, and fed the small animals together. It is a good place to take your baby for a summer vacation. Next time, bring your friends and family again!

There are several peacocks at the front desk, but I prefer the stray mother cat and a litter of kittens next to it haha.

Upgraded the river view double bed room in District 9, free fruit and pistachios. I like the room with a big terrace. It should be nice to drink coffee in cooler weather.

The room facilities are quite new, all kinds of children's products are complete, there is a smart toilet, and the cups are placed in the disinfection cabinet.
 
There are farms in the resort, you can go boating on Yanzhu Lake, the cafe has a nice view, and the price is not too expensive. (American style + ice cream muffins 90 yuan). Having a baby can kill a lot of time.

The swimming pool hasn't opened yet, it's a bit small, I guess dumplings will be served during the summer vacation hh

The air-conditioning in the breakfast restaurant is a bit windy, and the food is delicious. The hand-rolled noodles are strong, and the tofu buns are also good. I also brought two rice balls to climb the mountain to eat. It was perfect.


The housekeeper, Wu Linxiao, was warm and thoughtful, and finally gave gifts to the children, which was highly praised.

The amount of exercise is just right for children walking around the hotel. If they are tired from walking, they can also take a car on the side of the road. There are various swings on the road, you can play in the water by the creek, climb the climbing frame and suspension bridge in Hobbit Village, and go a little further to see small animals. There were also many activities. The children made leaf rubbings in the reading room and kayaked on Yanzhu Lake. They had a great time.

The service is excellent, and the staff are very friendly, especially Xiao Liu who wears glasses in the front hall. He not only gave the children a small gift when we checked in, but also took us to the room and introduced us to the hotel facilities and surrounding ways of playing. Because of his introduction, On the second day, the children got on the long-awaited parent-child bicycle, rode along the green road along the river for a while, and experienced the speed and joy of descending the curve.

The only fly in the oin**ent is the hotel's Chinese restaurant, the dishes are not worthy of the price.

Hygiene: Clean and tidy, the ecology of the hotel is in the woods of Shuiwan, and the work of deworming is very good. 🧹
Environment: Absolutely five-star praise. Beautiful mountains and rivers, smoky, far away from the city, fresh air, only the sound of nature. 🌲
Service: The service of the butler Xiaoan is very good, he is a sunny and handsome boy! Maybe because it was not full, we took the initiative to upgrade the room type. Plus a small gift. Thank you so much 🙏

msg:I brought my children and stayed here for three nights. I booked a mountain view room. The external environment of the hotel is quite good. The artistic conception of Fuchun Mountain Dwelling has been fully realized. My favorite is the scenery of Yanzhu Lake. There is a large open area when I go out. In the waters of the Fuchun River, I sit by the lake every day, observing the sky, clouds and shadows, and repairing my body and mind. The hotel's parent-child facilities are very complete, indoor and outdoor children's playgrounds, ranches, insect hotels, cruise ships, fishing, picture books, parent-child facilities you can think of, there are cafes and healing facilities for adults, and the attitude of the service staff is also very good. Thanks to every driver of the battery car, as well as the chef of the noodle shop. I would like to praise Master Wu Xiangyang of Gua Gua Paradise for taking good care of the child. He also gave the child some small camping equipment. The child was very happy.
Just a little bit of a fly in the oin**ent:
1. It is recommended that the hotel add an indoor swimming pool.
2. The socket in the room is not working well.
3. Cleaning should be strengthened in the corridor outside the room.

Before check-in, the handsome housekeeper, Xiao Liu, communicated fully with us and upgraded our room type in advance. The welcome fruit was also full of welcome fruits, which gave us a big surprise. The layout of the room is not bad, except that there is no toilet on the first floor, and the elderly have to go to the second floor to use the toilet. Hahaha. The hotel was full on the night of check-in, so the restaurant was also full. Fortunately, the butler will pay attention in advance and notify us to eat at a suitable time to avoid waiting in line. In fact, the biggest highlight of the hotel is its friendliness to pets, so that parents of fur children like us can rest assured on vacation. Check out the episode. The peak usage of eco-cars did not arrive. The housekeeper was afraid that we would be in a hurry. He carried our luggage in the rain and took us down the mountain. I must give a big praise. The overall environment and service of the hotel are very good. I will definitely come again next time.

🔸Hobbit Village｜Outdoor climbing facilities built in the woods.

Before arriving, I consulted about transportation, activities, etc. The hotel staff was very enthusiastic and sent a hotel map and surrounding tour introduction through WeChat; I was waiting for us at the hotel gate before arriving that day. When I checked in, I took the elderly and children into consideration, so I went directly Made an upgrade and sent welcome fruit and snacks.
The scenery inside the hotel is really good, and it's not bad to walk around.
Especially when there is fog in the early morning, it is simply a realistic version of Fuchun Mountain Residence.
It is very suitable for walking with the elderly and children.

Special thanks to the following three staff members:
1. Reception staff of the hotel (Xiaoan):
The service before and after check-in was great, and even helped us send our luggage to the room. Special attention was paid to the precautions during the stay.
2. The picture book library staff (Tu Kejuan)
Be patient with children and have a very good service attitude.
3. Staff of Express Service Depar**ent (Zhang Jianqiang)
The TV in the room could not be turned on, so I arrived quickly and helped to check and reset the network. After the end, I also enthusiastically reminded the elderly and children to pay attention to safety and hold on to the handrails when going down the stairs. Enthusiastic, great service, thank you.

If there is a chance in the future, I will stay here again and recommend it to my friends.

When you check in, you will be upgraded directly. There is also a free breakfast for children and welcome fruits, such as pears and mandarin oranges. The interior of the hotel is not very big, the scenery is pleasant and beautiful, and it is not tiring to walk around.

The Fuchun River is quiet and charming in the morning. There are no cars on the green road. There are few people in the mountains. There is also a cherry blossom road, which is very gratifying. The breakfast is also very good, there are those you want to eat every day, and there are special rice balls. It is also good for parents and children or taking the elderly for a walk on vacation. The ancient town of Meicheng, which is four or five kilometers away by car, is quite spacious, clean and charming. If there is nothing in particular that I want to go next time, I may come again.

msg:Very wonderful stay experience. I ordered a package with three garden view rooms. When I arrived at the store, the front desk gave me a free upgrade to a lake view single-family villa. The family members were shocked when they entered the villa, and the children were lying on their laps. I really shouted on the sofa cushion that I didn't want to go home. The children's playground in the hotel can make children happy, and parents can enjoy the beautiful scenery of Fuchun River along the mountain road while children are playing. The Chinese restaurant in the hotel tastes good and the price is relatively moderate. The free breakfast is complete in variety, as well as freshly squeezed juice, and the taste of orchid broad beans served with porridge is even more amazing. The free strawberry picking coupons in the package once again add a lot of color to our itinerary. On the same route, when I passed the pier on the return trip, I chartered a speedboat and swam on the Fuchun River. The boss of the speedboat was very considerate. He would stop at the beautiful section of the voyage for everyone to take pictures and sometimes adjust The direction of the speedboat allows the scenery, the big cruise ship and the characters on the bow of the speedboat to be in the same frame.

The housekeeper has already contacted and arranged before the arrival. Xiao Wu at the front desk and the manager Liu on duty that day are doing their best, enthusiastic and patient. Really. Take the trouble. It's just that the room hardware is well maintained, and the management group has put their minds to it. The fruit given to members is also a local specialty, not a perfunctory high-end product. In the end, I didn't expect the breakfast to be so rich, and the freshly squeezed juice is a great experience! Let's come again when the spring is warm and the flowers are blooming~

msg:Accommodation: I booked a mountain view king bed room, and I upgraded to a river view king bed room for free. The room is quite big, and the decoration is more log style. The room is very clean, and there are welcome fruits every day. The room comes with a quite large terrace, where the sun shines directly and is very comfortable. The only thing is that the spotlight on the top of the door is broken, and it will be very dark when you go back at night.

Food: The first meal was dinner at the hotel. When I booked the room, I was given fish head soup. The taste was amazing. It may be because it is adjacent to Qiandao Lake, so the waters are connected. In addition, breakfast is also
Not bad, I am very satisfied with the variety and quality, and there is also special honeycomb.

OK: There is a 2-3 km Yanjiang Mountain Road on the way to the hotel. It will be a bit difficult to meet cars in the opposite direction. There are no street lights at night, so turn on the high beam slowly and honk the horn more often at the corners. The hotel's parking lot is not very big, and it can be fully parked this season.

Play: There are still several activities for children to play, mainly hiking, which should be due to seasonal reasons. There should be more activities in summer, and of course there will be more people. I want to complain: the cruise in the inner lake in the hotel is too expensive: 195 for an hour... comparable to the cruise in Disney Town.

Service: Praise the hotel staff Zhang Cheng by name. After the app booked the hotel, he took the initiative to add me on WeChat the next day and sent a lot of hotel-related travel information. He answered all questions in a timely manner. And the service is always with a smile, which is great!

All in all: This is a satisfying journey!

msg:In addition to the beautiful river view, the hotel's software and hardware are not satisfactory. We arrived at the hotel after two o'clock in the afternoon. At the noisy hotel front desk, we were told that the room was still being cleaned. Let us go to the lobby and wait a while. We will call to notify you after the cleaning is completed. We waited in the lobby bar until the guests cleared up, it was already around 4:30. When I asked the front desk, the girl was a little flustered and apparently forgot about me. Fortunately, the room is arranged on the top of the mountain, just a few steps away from the swimming pool. The scenery is not bad, and the room is hidden by the vegetation on the top of the mountain, which makes up for the unhappiness when checking in. It's just that the hardware of the hotel is superficial, and the rough materials can be seen in the details. Some of the power *****s are difficult to plug into. The drying rack is crooked. There are not many varieties of dinner and breakfast, but the chef's level is really not very good. The dishes cooked are as superficial as the appearance of the hotel. Most of the aunts and children in the parent-child hotel are noisy. A group of children are running and making noise at the dining table. The aunts are posing for pictures and talking and laughing loudly. Their plates are full of food and they persuade the children to eat more. As a result, greed outweighs food intake and wastes a lot . After seeing it, I was speechless, so I hurriedly finished my breakfast and left the restaurant. Bad dining experience. In the afternoon, I went to see the swimming pool and found that it was just a small pond, not a standard swimming pool at all. This design is not for swimming, because it is impossible to swim at all. This is only for posing and children playing in the water.

msg:Recommended by a friend, I booked a day trip back to Qiandao Lake. First of all, the road in was difficult to drive. The female driver would have a headache when encountering a car. As for the service, the front desk and the driver who picked up and dropped off were pretty good. The hotel gave me a very good feeling. It was a mess. The lights in the swimming pool were broken that night and I ended my swimming early. I ordered dinner from the restaurant on the second floor. The price was not cheap and the food was okay. A child overturned a bowl and the restaurant staff didn't care. I paid the bill. I added a 10-yuan bowl to the bill without telling me. I was happy to pay for it after all, I knocked it over. But you should at least tell me and add it directly to the bill. I'm afraid that I can't afford it? The amu*****t park charges a fee so that children can play until they leave the store. There is also a charge for all kinds of animals. In short, everything is charged, and they are not cheap. This is a family hotel. For a room rate of 1,200, shouldn’t it provide the facilities that a family hotel should have? Except for the swimming pool, which is free (the lights are broken), everything has to pay. The management structure is too small. I will never go there again. When I ask for water at the front desk, I can only give you 2 bottles at a time, usually 3 sips. For those traveling at home, it is said to be a rule. Don't blame the employees, blame the management, small structure, stingy, one-time consumption. It's not worth it at all, they were all deceived by **. This is the first time I write such a long negative review. I have stayed in many large and small hotels in Zhejiang for so many days. This is the only one I want to complain about. Don't come to me either, I told you my true thoughts.

There is also a separate charge of 48 for the Guagua Paradise, so I am speechless. This is the first time I have encountered such a situation. If you want to book a more expensive room type, you should carefully consider it and read the bad reviews. Generally speaking, the service is average and the room environment is average. Only this lake is okay. The swimming pool is better for aerial photography. The hobbit is actually quite stretched. The animals are dirty and messy.

msg:It is a relatively unique country hotel, suitable for vacation and leisure or parent-children.
Advantages: There are many facilities and projects suitable for parents and children, which are necessary for walking babies. for example
1. Small Animal Paradise is probably the one with the most animals I have encountered. In addition to the common peacocks, sheep and geese in Kaiyuan, there are also deer, pigs, and rabbits.
2. There are two indoor and outdoor children's playgrounds, and the indoor area is also relatively large
3. You can rent bicycles with child seats to go to the greenway. There are also natural conditions such as small waterfalls nearby, which are especially suitable for taking children to play in the water in summer.
4. Kaiyuan has long-term advantages and better service

insufficient:
1. I stayed in the children's suite at the beginning. The location of the room is near the creek of the hotel, but the floor heating equipment is not very powerful, and it is really cold in winter. Probably much better in summer
2. The moving line design of the suite is not very reasonable. Washing, clothing storage, boiling water and drinking water, the moving line from the shower room to the bathtub is rather strange. It is often necessary to go back and forth from the bedroom to the living room and from the living room to the bedroom to complete it. needs...

3. Surrounding
Jiande is a treasure city, where scenery and culture coexist
The hotel is very close to the ancient city of Meicheng. Although the ancient city is somewhat commercialized, the archways in the ancient city really witness the cultural status of Jiande's "Yanzhou".
The diet is also quite characteristic of the wharf, the sea is open to all rivers, and you can also buy delicious strawberries this season.

5. Traffic
Preferred self-driving
The hotel is relatively remote, it is not easy to take a taxi, and there is almost no takeaway

msg:The weather is not good on the weekend, but it is still a small tour around.
The front desk service is very good. Before arriving, I called and asked if there was any service I needed, and upgraded the room.
The decoration of the room is relatively ordinary, the balcony is very good, and the sound insulation is not very good.
But the whole hotel environment is very good, green trees, safflower, small scriptures, lakes are very natural!
The whole is very suitable for taking children and enjoying the natural scenery!

msg:The hotel has beautiful scenery, with mountains and water, walking along the green road, the scenery is very good.
There are rich parent-child facilities, including indoor playgrounds, outdoor activity venues, and parent-child courses. I participated in Sun View Nature and got to know many plants.
Chinese restaurant dishes taste online, and the quantity is sufficient.
The room is clean and tidy, and the size is average. I have experienced two room types. I feel that the different room types are slightly different except for the scenery seen. The interior of the room is almost the same. I feel that it is meaningless to set a high-priced room type.
Deficiencies: The sanitation of indoor parent-child parks needs to be improved.

The hotel is very friendly to small animals. I brought a dog and a cat. The 510 villa is very quiet and private. It is suitable for bringing small animals.
Surrounded by mountains and rivers, it is more original. Of course, there are many bugs. I have seen bed bugs many times and many ants have secretly carried ******** out. There are also many butterflies. The cat has been chasing butterflies in the garden and having fun

msg:A very pleasant trip, suitable for a family holiday, especially children. Environment 🍃First of all, we lived in a double bed room with mountain view, a small squirrel room, and a large terrace, but the toilet water volume in the toilet was particularly small😢. Regarding play, we have been in the hotel for 3 days and 2 nights, Gugua Paradise (charged, but unlimited entry), Hobbit Paradise, children love it very much. There is not much water in the creek, but you can also catch small fish. Boating is also good, but the price is too expensive. We rowed 150/1 hour for a family of three. The most fun thing is the swimming pool. Our family likes it very much. We went there twice. Generally speaking, the hotel is good. The shuttle bus in the scenic spot is fast and convenient. However, no one gives a detailed explanation for the activities and places of play in the scenic spot. It is recommended that the shuttle bus driver can make a brief when picking up and picking up guests. Introduction.

It is suitable for a family to stay away from the noisy city life, especially when sleeping at night when there is only the sound of insects. There are a lot of children's amu*****t facilities, but my baby basically didn't experience it much. It closed at about 8:30 in the evening. A little bit of self-driving friends should pay attention to it. The road to the hotel is relatively narrow, so it is inconvenient to go out for meals and other things.

Even if it is rainy and humid outside, the air-conditioning makes people comfortable and dry. Dinner at the hotel is acceptable, and Kaiyuan members enjoy discounts. Although the refrigerator provides free drinks and snacks, it is recommended to provide free instant noodles, which is convenient for guests who are accustomed to late-night snacks. After all, the hotel is in a mountain nest, and it is really inconvenient to go out to eat. The breakfast is Chinese and Western buffet style, and there are also local specialty snacks worth tasting. In short, it is quite satisfactory and it is worth recommending to those who want to relax and take a vacation.

The hotel is located in the Qili Yangfan Scenic Area, so the scenery is good and has its own parking lot, but if it hits the peak period, the parking space may be tight.
The front desk and the restaurant are in the same building. The front desk staff are very friendly and the service attitude is also very good. This is worthy of praise, after all, this is a resort hotel.
Restaurant on the first floor: in the morning it is a buffet breakfast, in the evening it is a buffet restaurant (I didn’t eat it, so I don’t comment). I think the breakfast can only be quite satisfactory and there are not many highlights. The bread in the bakery area looks very cheap, which is not very it is good.
Room: Due to the rainy season, the room has a strong musty smell, but there are no mosquitoes in the room, which is good. There is a small cup disinfection cabinet in the room. This is very considerate. There is welcome fruit (banana*2, Apple*2), apples are quite delicious.
Hotel periphery: Because it is in the scenic area, the environment is pretty good, and there are small attractions suitable for children. The infinity pool has a good view. The gym is under the infinity pool. It is estimated that there will be a lot of greenery, plus it is humid and there are more mosquitoes. Good insect prevention preparation.
All in all, this is a hotel suitable for couples and families with younger parents and children. The scenery is good, and it is quite suitable for relaxing.

Check in at more than 1 o'clock in the afternoon, because the room is still being sorted, so you can call me back. When there was no news after 2 o'clock, I took the initiative to call to ask, and told me that the room was just right, and let me go to the front desk to get the room card, okay, it was really the room just right. I can understand the charges for the Quagua Paradise on the second floor, but if you dare to charge, you should manage it carefully! Children of all ages can enter, and no one cares whether you wear socks or not. There is no need to disinfect before entering, anyway. There are a few game machines in the small game hall next to it. We dropped the coin and the machine did not respond. It happened that the staff came to collect the coin. We responded to the situation. The staff "I just arrived and I don't know", so they didn't. After that, people continue to manage their own currency collection, completely ignoring the fact that we were swallowed by the game currency. Don't mention the buffet dinner, it is simply a nigh**are experience. You will basically have nothing to eat if you go to dinner at 5 o'clock and 6 o'clock. If you get the money, you will let it in. If you have a seat, look for it yourself. If you carry things in large bags and small bags, their employees will just take care of their chats, don't expect anyone to help. I'm too lazy to talk about other small details, in short, this hotel will not stay a second time.

msg:如果想去七裏揚帆坐遊船遊富春江，那肯定芳草地是首選。
景色真好，隨便哪裡都好看，果真是文人墨客愛了上千年的風景。

一大家子老老少少是晚上到的，正逢雷雨天，悶熱潮濕，江上已經起了濃霧。酒店升級了山頂套房，一層有異味，管家有提出幫我們換房，但是長者也不想麻煩，反正住在二層，還是要謝謝管家陳雯靜。異味在出太陽後散去。
山頂房需要拾級而上，對孩子是探險，對長者就還是山下標間合適。

酒店有霍比特樂園，可以溯溪探險，孩子再開心不過了。
員工熱情盡職。
圓圓臉的女經理（似乎是），管家陳雯靜，還有幫處理蜜蜂叮咬的前台高個子男服務員，酒店門口的大叔，謝謝。

中餐廳不錯，去嚴州古城玩，最後大家還是決定回到酒店來吃飯，環境更好，味口也更有保證。

不足的地方也很明顯，就是真的喊車很不方便。
無論是從酒店出來，還是從七裏揚帆碼頭回酒店，都很難叫到車。
要麼早做準備約車（也是要加價）；
要麼請前台幫忙加價喊車。

想去旁邊的綠道騎一騎車，也租不到自行車，遺憾。

更適合自駕+自備自行車，因為綠道不允許開車進入。

msg:優點：1.酒店坐落在富春江邊，風景美如畫
2.主打親子，酒店裡的遊玩項目豐富，划船，溯溪，攀爬，挖沙，萌寵等等，可以一站式搞定遛娃
3.管家服務非常貼心，還沒到酒店，我們的專屬管家小馬就已經跟我聯繫了，詢問了到店時間和需求，入住期間也第一時間響應我們的需求，有種賓至如歸的感覺

需要改善的地方：
1.早餐管理混亂，需要自己找座位，建議高峯期在門口排隊，有空位了，再由工作人員帶至座位
2.自助餐收餐盤不及時
3.酒店寵物友好，但要分區，大堂可以劃分攜帶寵物休息區，不然有的寵物坐過的位置，後面有人又會坐，有些人對寵物毛容易過敏
4.客房服務需要改進，酒店主打親子，卻沒有親子洗浴用品，第一天入住多要了一條浴巾給小朋友用，第二天客房打掃時就可以多給客人備一條，這樣體驗感會比較好
5.節假日酒店中餐可以適當延時，或者全天供應，畢竟都是來度假的，早上九十點吃早飯，中午不會吃飯太早，酒店周邊又沒啥餐飲，酒店裡麪就應該滿足客人餐飲的需求
6.酒店區域較大，指示牌不明顯
7.進出酒店的路比較窄，如果堵車，需加強管理疏理

當天晚飯在愛麗絲自助西餐廳用餐，不是太喜歡，下次去的時候要去試試中餐廳。
親子酒店小朋友玩的項目有很多，呱呱樂園是不限次數進出的，設施有點陳舊，衞生也不是太乾淨。
小朋友參加了叢林探祕的活動，有帶隊的工作人員，製作了一個微景觀植物，還挺有意思的。
霍比特村是户外的，繩索吊橋之類攀爬的，小朋友玩的也很開心。
酒店很大，小朋友可以玩的項目還有很多很多，臨時出遊沒有做攻略，感覺匆忙來匆忙去，留着遺憾下次再去。

       首先，酒店的風景環境真是美得讓人窒息。溪水環繞，湖泊如鏡，整個酒店依山而建，彷彿與大自然融為一體。在這裏，可以感受到大自然的寧靜與和諧，讓人忘卻塵世的煩惱。
       酒店的房型也非常獨特，每一間房都充滿了設計感。透過窗户，可以欣賞到山間的美景，讓人彷彿置身於一幅美麗的畫卷之中。在這裏，我們可以盡情地享受大自然的恩賜，感受大自然的魅力。
       除了美麗的風景，酒店還提供了豐富的娛樂活動。我們可以去爬山玩水，感受大自然的清新與活力；還可以喂山羊、喂小動物，與它們親密接觸，體驗鄉村的淳樸與樂趣。特別是那個霍比特村，彷彿帶娃進入了一個奇幻的世界，讓人流連忘返。
       酒店的餐飲也非常出色。菜品豐富多樣，口味地道，讓人回味無窮。每一道菜都充滿了用心與熱情，讓人感受到了酒店對客人的關愛與尊重。
       特別值得一提的是，這次旅行中，酒店安排的管家小馬全程為我們服務，非常體貼細心。他時刻關注我們的需求，為我們提供了周到的服務。在離開時，他還送給我們了一個精美的手辦禮，讓我們感受到了酒店的熱情與真誠。
       總之，杭州富春芳草地度假酒店是一次難忘的旅行體驗。在這裏，我們不僅可以欣賞到美麗的風景，還可以感受到大自然的魅力與酒店的關愛。我相信，這裡會成為我們心中永遠的回憶。體驗感非常棒。不愧是江浙滬芳草地之首。

另他們家中餐廳的菜色和口味也是可圈可點值得推薦！唯一需要吐槽的是酒店的自助早餐，沒有小朋友想吃的香腸和培根等肉肉，是工作日的早餐全素嗎？感覺這個標準多少有點與開元要求不符，都知道行業內卷厲害，外資酒店大多都被捲鋪蓋了，標準降級了😅😅😅

入住前，管家雯靜已經主動聯繫，瞭解入住的特殊需求，並且給了一些温馨提示。
到店時很驚喜地給我們升級到了富春別墅，兩家人入住超級完美，景色超絕，入住第一天下雨，第二天放晴，體驗了兩種風味的富春江景緻。
房間整體收拾得乾淨，温度控制得很宜人。
餐飲基本可以在酒店解決，午餐晚餐野爐中餐廳的魚頭皇一定要嚐嚐，好吃地道，各色炒菜都不出錯，一大桌人吃的很舒服。早餐的飯糰、豆腐包、餛飩都美味。
娛樂活動對於五六歲的小朋友來説是夠玩的，室內部分：呱呱樂園隨時可以去，隔壁的手工和繪本館也可以隨時去坐坐玩玩。大人可以ktv、棋牌室、健身房。室外部分就是煙渚湖採風，可以坐坐船，還有山頂的無邊泳池和新月集咖啡館，大人小孩都喜歡，天晴曬太陽，娃還能吃個冰淇淋，高興到飛起～
入住送了旅拍，體驗了一下，留個念還不錯。
退房時倆娃收到了管家雯靜送的青蛙玩偶哈哈，開心加倍

剛出發，管家小安主動聯繫確認抵達時間，給我們安排各種小細節，年夜飯的預訂，出行攻略等等。
入住體驗絲滑
早餐品種豐富，飯糰和手擀麪很好吃
酒店也安排了不少新春活動
非常愉快的入住體驗～

🐎動物園的師傅很和善，讓我們度過了非常開心的餵食小動物以及第一次騎馬體驗。🕸️霍比特村也是孩子們撒野的地方。
🍵星空下的實習服務員很温柔，我們嚐了雞尾酒、喝了花茶、品了果乾，還讀完了《魔球》。
☕️星月集環境很舒適，雖然下着雨不能坐室外，但室內很暖和，燈光很柔和，咖啡和蛋糕味道中規中矩。
🎠繪本館的書很不錯，還體驗了樹葉標簽，遊樂場一如既往地歡樂，感謝服務員屠可娟熱情周到。
🐟今天還幸運地趕上了開漁節，煙渚湖撈魚、猜魚，還有魚湯、麻餈品嚐，我們買了條魚，中餐廳免費加工做了兩吃。

🐟首先，滿足我老公釣魚佬的需求，感覺酒店就是為釣魚者設計的，哈哈，船屋、垂釣屋，還有公共平台，真的，我家那位第一天到凌晨兩點，開心的不得了，而且還設有標魚，釣到可以免房費，連我聽了都很心動
🐟其實這樣已經很好了，但是沒完，對小朋友也很友好，松鼠屋、青蛙主題房間、路邊各種青蛙、蘑菇、鞦韆、玩樂設施都像童話世界，關鍵還有溯溪，夏天小朋友要玩瘋了
🐟還沒完…他們居然還是寵物友好！！我真的感覺是為我們家而設的酒店～野爐中餐廳也好吃～
🐟酒店周圍一圈環境沒的説，在酒店三天兩夜是絕對可以消磨的～服務也很好，感謝前台小吳～很可愛的小姑娘沒有過分熱絡，有問題即刻解決，在可以的範圍裏滿足我們的要求～給人感覺非常舒服～

        這回我們訂了“梅子”系列的房型，獨門獨户的兩層，樓上兩室帶兩個獨立衞生間，共用一個大露台，可以看到富春江景和酒店內部湖景，後面倚着山坡，樓下是個大客廳，沙發打開後還是張床，兩家人家或是一家老小住着可舒服啦[愉快]
        其實整個酒店園區也處處是景：山間綠植茂盛，溪水湍湍流動，湖面清澈透底，到處綠意盎然、生機勃勃，連空氣都因負氧離子充足而顯得格外香甜，這才是名副其實的度假酒店[強]
        在這裏大人悠閑自在，孩子們也如魚得水：可以去盟寵樂園餵動物，可以在溪流上方的網籠中攀爬，可以泛舟湖面體驗水上運動，還可以在室內小童樂園玩上半天……
        中餐和自助餐廳的環境都還不錯，有一些建德地方特色的菜式值得嘗試，性價比不錯，服務也值得稱讚👍
        總之，很愉快的體驗，夏天的時候應該感覺還要好，因為可以下到溪流玩水，到處都是乘涼的地方……期待下次再會[微笑][擁抱]

但是提醒要來度假村的遊客，記得多帶點零食，酒店叫不到外賣，酒店裡和周圍的餐廳價格都不便宜。想要吃的性價比高點，還得跑去旁邊的梅城古鎮。算是這趟旅行唯一不方便的地方了。總體來説，值得五星好評！

再説説不好的，交通一般，進去出來一直會堵車，門口的山路很小很窄。愛麗絲餐廳很一般，服務完全沒有，領班經理彷彿在夢遊，自顧自玩手機聊天，在客人流量爆倉的情況下，也沒有安排位子，亂七八糟。度假村內部全靠電瓶車接送，在高峯時間，明顯運力不足，要等很久。

富春芳草地值得多次前來休閑度假！

msg:環境是好的，五星的環境，但酒店設施比較老了，進門房間就是濕噠噠的，看得出來打掃地很匆忙馬虎，另外房間內東西的品質低下，床品和衞浴設施都是很廉價的，所以不會有常規的五星酒店進去後的放鬆感，而是充滿了緊張感，感覺不乾淨不整潔，住酒店的應該能體會這種感覺。

酒店服務還可以，入住給升了房型，但不足的地方就是不足，包括早餐的水平和餐廳陳舊的桌椅和奇怪的擺設，在過道吃完了早飯。

總的來説，酒店浪費了那麼好的環境，比芳草地更便宜的價位不如住市區新安江邊的五星酒店。真是有點可惜這環境了。

管家小丁姐姐很可愛，細心，隨叫隨到。服務很好。
接駁車的各位也都很熱心。服務周到。 
套餐裏的旅拍，孩子不配合，本來以為選不出片的。結果拍的還挺好的，還是選了套餐。比自己拍的好看多了。@新鋭旅拍

雖然天氣不太美麗，但小朋友還是堅持下水去了小溪玩水😂前台辦入住的時候還有小孔雀看！
第二天酒店也幫我們升級了房間，靈蛙房真的很可愛！平方數會比松鼠房小一點，但是床下有很多洞可以鑽！
房間廁所有小寶寶的坐便器，洗漱台有小寶寶的踩腳蹬凳，浴袍和拖鞋都有小朋友專用的，房間還有消毒櫃，真的是細節拉滿低齡友好！！
明天打算再去小童樂園和喂小動物，小朋友都超級開心，下次還來！

環境：在富春江邊上，湖邊，風景優美，靠近綠道，要住店才能停到裏面，管理有序。接駁車很方便，不坐車自己步行也很舒服，每個地方都能看到不同的美
房間：靈娃主題親子房非常棒，娃一進房間就被迷住了，照片發給朋友看都問酒店名字
活動：酒店很多親子活動，第一天劃了船，晚上7點吃了燒烤+看露天電影，第二天餵了動物，還在溪水邊撈了魚，第三天在繪本館拓印還和蜜蜂親密接觸取了蜂蜜，酒店還有室內外小童樂園，在酒店不出去都能玩的很開心
服務：服務非常好，管家小宋非常貼心，微信給了各種攻略，走的時候還送了娃禮物，真的很棒
唯一遺憾的是沒有帶泳衣錯過了無邊泳池，下次來一定補上

就感受到了管家熱情的服務 以及酒店裡特色的項目
原本的好心情被下水道堵塞給攪亂了
幸好酒店維護打掃都十分迅捷 所以還是選擇原諒了
加回來的一分是管家姐姐的
是她的態度及服務讓我很滿意
酒店特別適合親子出行 萌寵樂園 泳池都特別適合小朋友
當然寵物也是很合適 不過小朋友很多 建議帶寵物的家長還是錯峯出行 這樣玩的會更盡興

管家挺熱情仔細的，小朋友拿到不少小玩具挺開心。
吃都是在酒店吃的，早餐跟中餐廳規規矩矩沒什麼驚喜，相比還是森泊比較好吃。
酒店活動蠻多的，參加了新鋭旅拍，可以拿三張免費快修，另外如果有自己喜歡的就自己加錢買。旅拍的工作人員都蠻熱情的，照片拍的也蠻好，我另外買了幾張，給旅行做個紀念。

酒店裡還有小朋友玩的遊樂園，喂小動物，釣魚等，特別喜歡喂小動物旁邊的小溪，非常清澈，生態非常好，可惜現在的天氣下水還是比較涼的。酒店大堂門口都有接送車可以去到入住的房間和各項玩樂的地方，隨叫隨到也是非常方便。應該會推薦給身邊的寶媽，期待下一次。

房間的親子設施完備，有即熱泡奶機，奶瓶消毒櫃，台階式小童腳踏凳，小童小拖鞋，小童牙膏牙刷，連寶寶玩的搖搖馬都有。美中不足的就是床墊太厚，不透氣，娃睡得一身汗。
中餐廳和西餐廳都有自助式的寶寶餐具、圍兜。小童餐椅數量多，完全不用擔心寶寶沒有餐椅坐。連餐廳裏的恆温熱水壺，温度都是設定在泡奶的温度。
酒店有大量的室內外小童活動設備，不管你是幾百個月的大寶寶還是幾十個月的小寶寶，都能找到你喜歡的去處。
酒店房間有點像三亞的鳥巢，錯落在山間，靠酒店的接駁車連接。酒店實行的是管家式服務，我們的管家小丁，為我們提供了非常貼心的服務。她知道寶寶要午睡，特地給我們延遲了退房時間，退房的時候還送了寶寶很多小玩具。
酒店還送了三張免費的旅拍，當天出片，對於專程帶寶寶出來慶生的我們，留下了珍貴的影像記錄。

msg:這麼多年旅行唯一一次被酒店氣到影響整個旅行體驗

建議酒店不能保證套餐的服務質量就乾脆不要做套餐

酒店套餐贈送了旅拍 但是裏面*********的男攝影師 對我和朋友進行區別對待。

同一個景點 我朋友拍了二十多張照片 我衹有五張。並且在選片的時候態度很差，因我衹有五張 且要麼是我沒看鏡頭，要麼是狗沒看鏡頭，要麼是狗很驚恐（因****男攝影師要求把狗放在比較高的吧枱桌上），所以我很難選出我要留那張，該攝影師就沒好氣的説“別看了 你就這五張”。我就這五張的原因是什麼？不是你不想拍 衹給我拍了五張嗎？

事後我找到旅拍客服想要投訴 客服妹妹人很好 一直在替不屬於她的問題、替男攝影師道歉，後把****攝影師叫來，態度依然趾高氣昂，在我提出該男攝影師態度有問題時，其表示他就長這樣，並問我“那你現在想怎麼樣”。最終提出補拍的補償方案。

但這浪費的不是我的時間嗎？
最主要的是不愉快的情緒已經產生了，同樣是消費者憑什麼我就要被區別對待 受氣呢？為什麼我出來旅行本是想要放鬆開心的，但卻要跑到你們這裏受氣呢？並且第二天我就要離開 誰有時間去補拍呢？為什麼要用我的時間精力去彌補該男攝影師犯的錯呢？
並且直到最後****都沒有道歉，衹是説他自己經驗不足 沒有多想。

另外 不知道酒店培訓怎麼回事 我揹着一個很大很重的背包，但所有工作人員都視而不見，全都去搶着幫我朋友推她帶萬向輪的隨機箱，也是開了眼了。

一家把區別對待刻體現在方方面面的酒店 真的是服了。在這家酒店我甚至一度懷疑自己是透明的？

反正以後這個品牌的酒店我是不會去了，噩夢一樣的三天經歷。江浙滬寵物友好的酒店那麼多，該酒店硬件設施雖説不上差但也談不上好，結果服務方面還有****男攝影師這樣的人來給客人帶來難以磨滅的糟糕體驗，要靠什麼來和別的酒店競爭呢？

房間在山上，環境自然不用説，私密性也很強。
親子項目非常多，酒店入住後，都是觀光車接送，幾分鐘就一般，去哪裡都非常方便。什麼都可以在酒店沒解決，無邊泳池，露天電影，星舟咖啡，中餐廳自助餐……
房間訂的是靈蛙親子，小朋友超級喜歡，雖然在山上，卻一點不潮濕。真的非常棒的酒店，下次假期再來。

第一天下午3點入住的，入住之後去遊了泳，無邊泳池很棒，記得帶泳帽，現場買的話30一頂；外出覓食，結束後呱呱樂園玩high了，8點半結束請安排好時間；第二天早上8點去吃的自助早餐，人超多；9點去了二樓的繪本館，有免費的植物拓印活動，敲敲打打玩的很開心；然後去萌寵樂園喂小動物，30元一份的胡蘿蔔，有矮馬、兔子、梅花鹿、鴕鳥、香豬、山羊、綿羊……可以騎馬走一圈，58左右，喂完動物可以去霍比特村，山野探險之類的活動，結束後又去呱呱樂園玩了1小時，差不多12點退房；

呱呱樂園邊上有一家隱藏的寶藏麪館，可以去午餐打卡；還有中餐廳也可以打卡，價格比外面實在，服務也好；

二天一夜真的太合適帶娃打卡了！下次還要來😊

其實光在酒店混兩天也玩不夠 小溪流摸魚 雖然摸不到 哈哈哈 萌寵樂園 皮划艇 小童樂園 叢林探險 都沒全部玩到
所以很期待下次還來哦

服務：住店當天就有管家聯繫了，點名表揚王蘇田小管家～真的很棒，從入住到離店都很貼心。對待小朋友也很熱情。這裏所有的工作人員真的都寵物友好且小童友好。


設施：
這裡有無邊泳池（雖然不大），但是分出了深淺水池。
有小小牧場（雖然不大），但是小朋友過個餵食的癮足夠了，一份三十的餵食籃子也是足夠喂一圈。
從房間出來是需要聯繫接駁車的，高峯時段的電話是打不通的，可以聯繫管家幫忙。
室內小童樂園屬實不錯，下雨的時候這裏很好消耗時間，隔壁就是手工活動的地方，每個時間段有不同的活動。

不足之處是叫車很難。酒店的雜草還需要進一步處理，餵動物園的絕對需要整改，實在不夠乾淨。而且喂完動物沒有洗手的地方讓我覺得難以接受。

不過總而言之很不錯的酒店。孩子們很開心！

建議：1.酒店的小賣部零食種類可以再豐富一點，因為酒店附近沒有任何商鋪，叫外賣也叫不到，衹有一家離酒店不遠處的飯店
2.晚上開車進酒店的路燈沒有，非常的暗，有一些安全隱患，希望以後能改進。

msg:四天三夜，住了三個房型，服務是真的好，要水，要被子，要接駁車，有求必應，速度很快~環境超級好，被綠樹環繞，有山有水有湖有小溪，好漂亮~
對小朋友很友好，餐廳有專門的餐具和圍兜提供，光盤還有小禮物~小童活動有很多，拓印，肥皂，小溪捉魚，餵動物，小朋友玩的不亦樂乎~
我們第一晚住了松鼠親子房，滑滑梯玩不停，溪水在旁邊，很方便，小朋友很喜歡~但是植被太好，整個房間有點暗，還有就是房間可以坐的地方太少，箱子也沒有地方放，衹能坐床上~
第二晚住了江景大床，我最喜歡的一個房間，明亮又開闊，露台很大，晾衣服好方便，沙發很大，對着電視劇，躺着看電視，抬頭可見新安江，贊就一個字~還有大大的浴缸，邊泡澡，邊看風景~~離泳池很近，游完泳就回房間，很方便~~
第三晚是雙卧套房，房間很大，有大大的餐桌，朋友小聚很方便，露台超級大，有兩個。但是一樓客廳沒有電視機，對於電視愛好者真不友好~這個沒有浴缸，不能泡澡了…主要是上上下下的拿東西，真的有點累。但是小朋友還是很喜歡，樓梯爬了好多遍~
但是電話在樓上，每次出門要上樓打電話叫車不方便，應該在客廳按個電話~還有洗手間在樓上，每次都要爬樓上去…
餐廳有點一般，門口有個烤餅，有點硬，有點鹹。梅州古城裡的烤餅要好吃很多，建議可以學習一下~~
重點是，服務很好，我們的管家吳飛龍，一個有點靦腆的小哥哥，每次換房都很客氣，還上門來幫我們提箱子。每個服務員看到，都會打招呼。最後一天退房，還來了兩個小姑娘幫忙拿東西，還要給我們送上車~~
小朋友下次還想來~~已經推薦給朋友了，大家很很有興趣呀~~

房間：房間雖然在綠化叢中，但是房間內卻非常乾淨，沒有蚊蟲打擾。床品沙發都非常乾淨，沒有污漬。天氣很熱，但兩位保潔阿姨都會按時上門用心把房間打掃的非常乾淨。水池浴缸每天都會刷的很乾凈。
服務；一下車門口就有個熱情的大叔接待指引，另一個大叔馬上把行李接過來，幫助先放在指定位置，大堂前台更是佈滿了工作人員，給了你滿滿的安全感。辦理手續非常迅速。並且會有擺渡車，等在那裡把你送到房間。最貼心的是每個房間都有自己的管家。我的管家是一個總是滿面笑容的熱情小女孩，林曉。從還未到酒店，她就加上我微信。到之前我把我的需求告訴她，她非常貼心的為我安排了我心儀的房間。讓我特別驚喜！進入酒店，小小的她卻堅持要幫我提行李送我去房間。並非常熱心的接待講解細節。隨時有要求，隨時就解決，特別有效率。整個住店過程全程陪伴。讓人感覺非常有安全感。退房也是一直陪伴，滿面笑容的告別。讓人很暖心。因為從服務人員就可以看出酒店的管理水平，而酒店的管理水平而反映出酒店的優質與否。這是一家美麗而又讓人暖心的酒店。而且是到建德一定會再來的酒店。

可以提前致電酒店加管家服務，201個房間錯落分佈在山水中，出房間可以招攬擺渡車。富春江水和酒店內湖都是垂釣好去處。建議記得帶魚竿噢。

親子酒店有室內遊樂園，萌寵投喂園，夏日小溪戲水，星空泳池，適合熊孩子放電，非常想吐槽酒店的手工繪本室，設定的根本不走心，燈光太暗，對孩子眼睛超級不友好。

特別表揚的3點: 管家詩蕾是真的在好好服務，不像有些掛名那種。晚上128的自助晚餐相當超值。穿梭的電瓶車響應及時、服務也好。
小商榷的一點：酒店各處掛帳好像不是首選，更傾向於現結。

有一個意見我提給酒店管理層，希望引起重視。我們第二天早餐，最後剩了一點點，具體如截圖。希望能打包走，不要浪費，無論是餐廳的服務人員，還是門口的接待，都説不行，而且態度不是特別友好。事實上，本人是開元酒店集團白金卡，洲際ihg鑽石大使，攜程金鑽，每年住的酒店不説一百也有八十，從沒有遇到這樣的情況，而且也根本不會沾這點小便宜。不説為了避免浪費，其他酒店我就明説打包一點，都非常客氣的直接打包，還送到客房，有些酒店有制度的，也是按人頭算量，不是特別過分的量，都會允許帶一點點走。這一點希望酒店管理層能改進，這個意見也不針對任何一線員工。

衞生：中規中矩，小蟲子在露台和進門口附近無法避免，現在這個季節蚊子還比較少。
餐食：在中餐廳用了一頓晚餐，土雞煲不錯，杭州片兒川好大一盆麪條，分開結算，使用了攜程訂房送的兩張滿200減50的券，四個大人兩個小朋友吃掉四百不到。
服務：服務很熱情，電瓶車隨叫隨到，管家小於服務也很周到，延時退房了一個小時，走的時候禮貌周到準備了水果給小朋友帶在路上吃，還有小賣部的戴貴寶小姐姐也是很熱情。
環境：進酒店的路程是一條雙向窄路，會車需要避讓， 晚上要格外注意安全。
遊樂：酒店分成幾個玩樂區域，大堂這裏就有很多小動物孔雀，分別做了植物拓印，寵物餵養，呱呱樂園，小朋友很開心。

餐飲方面一般般，訂的房間含早，晚上自助餐158一個人。周邊幾公里內沒啥餐飲，而且進酒店的一條道很窄，又被停了好多車，有點難開（希望改進）。
房間設施中規中矩，但每天都有水果送，而且露台很棒。要是酒店泳池也開放就更好了。
最後酒店風景那是沒的説，地方是選的真好，依山傍水，帶孩子很悠閑，酒店內小溪也很清澈，但撈不着魚，想撈魚的孩子就打消念頭吧...

酒店服務也很貼心方便，特別是此行管家於秋雨，提前電話溝通、確定預計到達時間後，就幫忙把房間準備好了，還可24小時微信諮詢，及時回覆，有問必答。
總之，酒店帶媽帶娃皆宜。衹是五一路上真的太堵，建議還是平日來，體驗感甚佳。

msg:管家於秋雨很貼心，幫忙升級了江景大床房，景色優美開闊，露台望出去綠葉葱蘢，江波浩渺，私密性也很好。最愛門前的那顆碧根果樹，葉子舒展，青翠可愛，還偶遇兩衹小松鼠啃碧根果
