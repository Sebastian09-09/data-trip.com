They take care of you as an individual (for example, they give advice and tips on where we want to go). They provide absolutely delicious home cook breakfast.

msg:I highly recommend this homestay! Super five-star reviews! I am a person who is extremely demanding on sleep quality. The homestay is very quiet. I can get a good rest at night after a tiring day at Disney! This is also one of the reasons why I choose to stay again! 
The hygiene is really great, there is no dead corner of hygiene at all! The cleaning aunt is even more considerate service. The baby's clothes will be cleaned for us every day and neatly stacked at the head of the bed! 
The housekeeper is very nice! Will carefully remember the preferences and precautions of each guest, will help arrange the driver to pick up and drop off, and will respond to all our needs in time! 
In short, it is as warm as home, like family and friends! Every year when staying at Disney, I will firmly choose Xianshe! !

msg:It was the first time to visit Disney, especially with the elderly and children, staying at Xianshe was the right choice.

As soon as you enter the door, you will feel at home. Each room has a dedicated shoe cabinet, and there is a shoe horn that must be praised. The suitcase aunt will wipe it clean before sending it to the room. The room is very clean, there is not even a strand of hair, and the window is opened in advance for ventilation, the air is fresh, and people relax all of a sudden.

The housekeeper asked about our travel plan in advance, and after many communications, he provided a suitable park plan for us, which saved a lot of time and energy, and the whole family had a lot of fun.

The breakfast is made by the aunt according to the dining time of different guests. There are scallion pancakes, egg pancakes, sweet potatoes, fried eggs, fried sausages, mixed cucumbers, small wontons, millet porridge, small pickles, etc. A home-cooked breakfast is much more comfortable than the restaurant in the park.

The villa is not far from Pudong Airport and Disney, and there is basically no traffic jam, so it is still very convenient to travel. If I come to Disney again next time, I will still choose Xianshe, a very treasured store.

This integrated plan makes me worry-free and at ease as a local guide. Hahahaha, it is worth recommending!

Each suite in Xianshe is different. Every time a customer comes, they like Suite 8 the most. It is large and spacious. If you are a little late, you can't book it. The housekeeper is always enthusiastic to help arrange it. This time, 2 suites on the 2nd floor were arranged, which is also very good!

Every day is cleaned up [celebration][celebration]. I really don't want to leave after staying here. Sisters, this Xianshe is really worth recommending [love][love].

Went there for two days for the second time. On the third day, the itinerary changed and I went to another place. The other hotel was really crowded. I immediately called the housekeeper to ask if there was a room available and I wanted to come back. I went there the first time and wanted to go a second time. I have three children. The children are noisy and do not eat on time. Even during meal times, my aunt cooked wonton stew for me several times for the baby to eat. Every time I order takeout, it makes the restaurant a mess. The housekeeper asked me not to touch her after I finished eating while she cleaned up. It really feels like home here. Every time I come back, my baby says he is home. Families who want to go to Disneyland must go to this hotel. It will definitely make you feel at home

msg:This is a family trip to Disneyland. Considering that Disney-themed hotels are relatively expensive and the rooms are small, they are not suitable for so many of us to stay in. So I searched a lot of accommodations online with my wife, and finally fell in love with this one. B&B and very close to Disneyland. The following is my personal experience, I hope it can help friends who go out to play next time:
1. The service is really warm and thoughtful
At that time, I called the housekeeper through the platform, and later added WeChat. It didn‚Äôt take long to send the specific location and check-in requirements of the B&B. Based on the number of people we came, we chose the most suitable No. 3 Tianyuan Warm Family Room; since we were We drove here from out of town, and we talked to the housekeeper on the phone in advance that we would arrive very late. Unexpectedly, the housekeeper waited until we arrived. It was already past 10 o'clock in the evening. This point touched my heart deeply, and he negotiated with us later. Wi-Fi password, how to adjust the heat and cold of the shower, the password for the door button, including breakfast status; to be honest, I am also in business. After all, business has not been easy in various industries in the past two years, so we should maintain our original intention and work hard. The only way to serve every customer is to be practical and considerate!
2. Facilities are clean and livable
When you walk into the house, you will feel very refreshing, without any odor, the cleaning is very clean, the mattress is very soft, I feel very solid when I sleep at night, and the hot water returns to the shower very quickly.
3. Breakfast diet
The housekeeper also negotiated with the housekeeper the day before to provide free breakfast for the next day. A specially hired aunt came to cook it. Because I bought the early bird ticket in a hurry, I didn't have time to taste it. I believe the breakfast is also good, which is a bit of a pity. But I‚Äôll save the opportunity next time
It's a really nice villa B&B. I'm very impressed and very NICE. The butler is also very good from introduction to service. If you go to Disneyland, you can consider this hotel. The main distance is not very far. I will come back next time. I also wish you good business. Prosperity, everyone will get rich together, and we will come again next time! üòÑ

It's a ten-minute drive to Disneyland. In the evening, the housekeeper will arrange check-in and what to eat for breakfast. What time will we wait in the car? In the morning, after the aunt has finished breakfast, the driver will wait for us to set off on time. When I came back, my aunt had already washed and folded the clothes, which is great news for lazy people! !

msg:1. The transportation in the area is inconvenient. This villa is actually converted into a B&B, and it takes ten minutes to drive from Disney. Not to mention the takeaway and other transportation are very inconvenient. You can only take a taxi, and there are no convenience stores, living and other supporting facilities in the photo. This may be because it is located in a suburban area.

2. The housekeeper requested not to eat in the room, but only in the underground restaurant. It's really inconvenient. Because we are in the suburbs, there are very few types of takeout, and the location of the takeout is not accurate. It takes a long time to call and find it. When we stay in a hotel, we can also eat directly in the room.

3. When checking out, he said he would give us a few bottles of water to take with us on the way, but he ended up getting three bottles of water in the living room. We didn‚Äôt know who they belonged to, so we shouldn‚Äôt bring them with us. She said we were wasting water.

4. On the day of check-in, I originally only booked one night, but then the housekeeper unanimously asked me to book one more night. She was very enthusiastic at first, so I thought about it and made the decision. I originally booked other hotels, but she asked me to book one more night. I canceled the refund. The refund process was very troublesome. I realized later that I felt I had been deceived. Then we needed an extra bed. The extra bed cost 200 yuan a night. The housekeeper asked us to use other mobile phones to place an order with good reviews and gave it to us for free. The extra bed fee is also reflected in the sales volume. When I wrote a review for him, the extra bed was actually a floor bunk, which was very poor. I thought it was outrageous.

5. On the last day, we needed to check out. The housekeeper asked us to check out before 12:00, but the housekeeper started urging us to check out at 11:13. After 11:30, he was already in our room urging us to hurry up. She kept urging us. She said that there was another client who needed to see the house, but before our check-out time, he had been watching us in the lobby and urging us to leave quickly. I washed my hair and didn‚Äôt even dry it. Just do it and leave directly.
But she didn't tell me one day in advance that I would check out at 12 o'clock, because I can check out at 2 o'clock in the hotel, and the hotel has 24-hour service and a front desk hotline, and the housekeeper would go to bed after 10 o'clock.
Later, because it was already very unpleasant when checking out, he said that you should not write reviews on it.

6. The recommended driver's attitude and service were also very poor. We couldn't find the road. He should have let us walk to his location, but we paid for it, so why couldn't we just wait where we were?
Moreover, when he saw the vehicle in front of him driving slowly, he kept beeping others, flashed his lights to others, and turned on the high beam. I think this kind of quality should not be found in Shanghai.

It was already past 11pm when we arrived on the first day. The housekeeper was still waiting for us before going to bed. He put the bath water in advance so that the children could take a bath after they arrived. He kept reminding me Things to pay attention to, after arriving, I felt really clean and spotless. We agreed with us on what time to go to Disneyland and arranged a breakfast plan. I would like to add that the breakfast was really delicious. You can tell how delicious it is just by looking at our plates. After breakfast, we took a special car to take us to Disneyland. In the evening, we were told what time to come back to avoid peak crowds and where to pick us up back to the hotel. We even planned what time to get us early the next day, knowing that we didn‚Äôt have time to return to the city. It‚Äôs well arranged and very warm. It recommends where to go and have fun. We can put our luggage in the villa. The driver has already helped us get our luggage back when we dropped him off at the airport. I really want to thank Xianshe for letting me experience the warmth of home. I will definitely do it again when I go to Shanghai. Going to live again, a place as warm as home is really top of my mind! Thank you to the housekeeper, thank you auntie for your thoughtful arrangements and care!

As soon as I arrived here, I was moved by the housekeeper's thoughtfulness and consideration. The housekeeper is very careful and warm, giving us the feeling of home. Here we can help wash and dry clothes, and we can call a car to pick us up at any time. There is a small area for children to play. Everything is just right. Changing shoes when entering the door is just like going home. It's very petty. This time I decisively came here with my friends and brought my children. It was like going home.

First, the sanitation is very clean, so it can be said that the first floor is not stained; second, the butler service is very considerate and considerate; third, the breakfast made by the cooking aunt is delicious. I can see that the aunt is a person who pays attention to hygiene, rest assured that it is clean breakfast. There is a feeling of coming home. The homestay is about a few kilometers away from Disneyland. The one-way Didi car is usually about 30 yuan, and the taxi is about 40 yuan. It is best to go to Disneyland at 4:30 in the morning, come back at noon to rest and take a nap, and go again around 5:00 pm to fly over the horizon It is recommended to take the fast pass, otherwise two hours is really not covered; for dinner, I recommend Disney Town Cheese Place, which is very worthwhile to eat.

I didn't have much expectations at first, but I didn't expect that the housekeeper would contact me before I even set off and tell me some things, from airport pick-up to check-in. The villa has a special car to pick you up from the airport. When you arrive at the villa, you will be warmly received by the butler. The service is warm and thoughtful. The room is large and bright. We are a family of four and have two rooms, both with large beds, and the privacy is very good. The children said that the breakfast was very good, and there was a special car shuttle to Disneyland, which was very convenient. The family members said that although going to Disneyland was very tiring, they felt healed when they arrived at the villa.

This time, my husband and I took the baby out to relax, and it happened to be a holiday for the elderly. When I was looking for a hotel on Ctrip, I wanted to find a room with a larger area. Unexpectedly, I fell in love with Xianshe at first glance, and it received good reviews. The key is to meet my first demand "big room" and decisively place an order for a few nights in a row.
Simply share my real accommodation experience with netizens:
1. The room is big and big
2. The hot water in the shower is fast and the water flow is large
3. The breakfast is really delicious. My aunt made it by hand in the morning. According to our breakfast time, I made it in time-sharing. There are eggs, small sausages, cabbage cakes (the first time I have eaten them, they are super delicious), small wontons, porridge, milk, and fruit juices. Every morning, my aunt will stir-fry a vegetable, and my aunt will ask from time to time if it is enough.
4. The butler service is also very thoughtful. Before we left, we went to Haichang Park to play. It was inconvenient to bring luggage. The butler specially arranged for the luggage delivery service to the next hotel in the city. I was worried about how to arrange the luggage, but now it is easy to solve.
5. One last thing, the aunts in the leisure house cleaned the hygiene very cleanly. It is no exaggeration to say that it was spotless. The baby accidentally stained the bed sheets. The housekeeper told the aunts to change them all as soon as possible. Bedding, it's really comfortable to sleep on, and the bed is big too. My husband and I sleep one sideways and the other upright. We also installed bed rails. We sleep peacefully at night, and the surroundings are very quiet. We wake up naturally, very comfortable. accommodation experience.

Seeing that the evaluation is very high and there are few bad reviews, I came here without high expectations. When we arrived, the housekeeper, Ms. Chang, received us very warmly and prepared slippers and other items for us. We consulted about the travel strategy. Ms. Chang spoke clearly and clearly, telling you which pitfalls to avoid and what to do. We played Disney according to her suggestion, and we were not very rushed or tired (not tired is fake, Disney is too big and there are too many people in line). When we go out to play, the housekeeper Chang will also provide remote support, help you solve the travel vehicles, assist in the purchase of fireworks tickets, and so on. The butler is very very good! It is worth mentioning that the breakfast is great, one meal per family, made on the spot according to the taste and the number of people, it is delicious!

I have been having a headache, and I don‚Äôt really want to go to the Disneyland hotel. The place is too small and the price is not affordable. I accidentally saw Xianshe with very high reviews, and I wanted to give it a try... In the evening, I drove my baby to the airport to pick up my father and then headed to Xianshe together. It was already very late and I felt very embarrassed. But the housekeeper was very considerate and kept waiting for us. He never forgot to remind us how to navigate, drive slowly and not be in a hurry, and even arranged parking spaces. The room we booked has two large beds. The housekeeper was afraid that having too many children would affect our sleep due to rolling at night, so he arranged a tatami-style extra bed for us. There is floor heating in the room, so it is very comfortable to sleep on, and we don't have to worry about the children rolling out of bed in the middle of the night. [laughing]

Auntie's breakfast was home-cooked, but very fresh and delicious. After a full meal, we went to Disneyland together... The children had a lot of fun and slept well at night. The villa was very quiet and very nice.

By the way, the auntie is really nice. She cleaned the new room very meticulously, cleanly and neatly. It was very comfortable when we returned to the room at night, and she also washed our socks. Thank you so much, I feel like a family is being taken care of silently.

There are not many rooms in the hotel, only 4 sets, which are few but refined. The service is impeccable and the guests are always considered.

msg:Very warm store, the service is very thoughtful, the bedding is idyllic, suitable for this English-style building, the breakfast is very rich, all hand-made noodles, bread, and steamed buns made by the aunt herself. The restaurant kitchen is on the ba*****t floor. The kitchen is full of condiments. If you are interested, you can cook your own food. It is worth gathering friends to spend a weekend together, and there is a small town of Bicester nearby to go shopping

Breakfast: The aunts are gentle and caring. They cook breakfast according to our time every day. It is rich and delicious, healthy and natural. The children eat well. The wonton stew in the aunt's hand bag is delicious~
Service: The butler arranged it very well, and we can chat together, just like being at home. Our whole family likes it very much. It is a place where we will stay every time we come to Shanghai. The only little thing missing is that there is no warm air that day. It will be arranged~

Originally booked a two-bedroom room No. 1, but it was difficult for us to bring our family and a pile of suitcases. The housekeeper thoughtfully upgraded us to suite No. 4, which is located on the first floor, which is super convenient!

It was clean and tidy, the decoration style was American, and the attitude of the landlady was great. It was great, we arrived at 10pm, and she actually came out to pick us up as a doorman. Next was the aunt, who was also very nice. The three of us made a sumptuous breakfast for us, and she also made bread. Will come again next time.

I‚Äôm afraid we won‚Äôt be full, so we have to prepare everything. I like this quiet place very much. The residence is more suitable for families or young people than ordinary big hotels.

msg:I finally stayed in the same type of homestay as Mao Xiaotong that I was thinking about. I booked it many times before but couldn‚Äôt get it. This time I‚Äôm going to Disney, so I chose the hotel again just to try my luck. But this time I was lucky enough to get a room. I originally booked a room for 2 No. Garden View King Bed Room, but we temporarily added a friend, and a bed was not convenient, so we went into the store to make up the difference and upgraded to this American-style spire two-bedroom suite, as shown, it is really a good shot.

The homestay can book 33 vip tickets, but because I booked vip tickets on a certain treasure because I was greedy for cheap, I was finally slapped in the face. This time, I saw that the B&B can book VIP tickets on behalf of me. I was not at ease, so I asked the housekeeper a lot of related questions, because I didn‚Äôt do a good job in the strategy before, so I paid a large amount of expensive IQ tax. The housekeeper patiently answered my questions one by one. Afterwards, I bought 3 33vip tickets at the B&B, and the butler also arranged for us to pick up and drop off in advance. It was really considerate and super nice. Woke up the next day and went downstairs after eating. I went straight to Disney, and when I arrived, I found that there is no harm without comparison. Seeing other people standing in a long line under the bright sun on a hot day is a spectacular scene. On the other hand, we entered the park directly from the VIP channel of Disney Town, and it took less than 5 minutes. This is a cool thing, basically 3 hours and 8 items can be played. The B&B can also purchase Disney goods and deliver them to your home.
The night before leaving, because the bathtub is so beautiful, in order not to waste it, I took a rose bath, which was very comfortable. It can be seen that the B&B really cares about the details, but it is a pity that the time is limited and we cannot stay for a few more nights. Next time I have a chance, I will come back and try other room types.

There are two aunts in the children‚Äôs entertainment area. There are two aunts at home. The cooking is extremely delicious. No need to worry about coming to Shanghai. Spicy aunts can also make small Sichuan dishes.a The big beauty in the photo is the Feng Da butler of the villa. Mei Xin Shan and enthusiastic. We stayed for four nights. When the kids didn‚Äôt want to leave, the parents were also full of praise and said that just take us out. Finding a good place to eat and rest like this üòÜ The villa has a shuttle service to Disneyland. It is very convenient because the community is a paradise in a large residential area in Pudong New Area, so the takeaway is also very convenient. I called when I was still walking. I took a SF and sent the burden back home. Anyway, I would like to thank the housekeeper Feng for his company and the two aunts for their amazing food. See you next year üòÉ
