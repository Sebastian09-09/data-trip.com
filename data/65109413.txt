Some disappointment though as we were expecting a relaxing atmosphere during our stay, there‚Äôs actually a wedding function at the restaurant which makes it quite noisy through out our dinner.

A lot of options to enjoy with family. The staff was great super helpful and nice and the room super nice, very spacious and with nice view. The food was also good but breakfast has not many western options. Overall is a great experience worth the price, great option for a weekend away from the city.

There is a PLAY for children to play. There are three small indoor rooms and outdoor amusement facilities, a sand pool with sand digging toys, a balance car with a helmet, and a bucket for watering vegetables. There are many styles and they are all mini, which is more suitable for younger children. There are also paid items in the room: making cookies and building. There are also adult bicycles for rent.

There are table football, archery, and mini golf on the other side of the lobby. There are yoga rooms, gyms, table tennis, table tennis, football and other table games on the same floor. There is also a theater where you can watch movies.

The breakfast was very rich and my mother was very happy to eat. There were also various play areas for children. Now the child is too young, and I will definitely come again in two years! When I was tired, I took some photos and soaked in the hot springs. It was really comfortable. The housekeeper Rosie was very considerate, answering various questions, giving travel advice, and paying attention to the travel experience. Especially on the first night of the stay, the baby cried in the middle of the night and we asked to change the room. It was also very timely and considerate to change it according to the requirements. My messy cosmetics were also placed on the towel. The reception staff were very friendly and polite, and the service was very thoughtful, from the reception to the restaurant. My mother kept praising the service.

At present, it is the ceiling of parent-child hotels in my mind. There are many facilities in the hotel to experience. Three days and two nights is just right. You don‚Äôt have to go anywhere in the hotel. The 2-year-old child is super happy and the adults are not tired.

The hotel does not have many varieties of breakfast, but some are very special and very good. The dining environment is also nothing to say.

There are few people on weekdays, and the experience is really great. I will go to this hotel again!

Baby: 1 year and 2 months
Hotel environment: The garden landscape is rich in green plants. It is very comfortable to walk in the hotel. However, there are many mosquitoes in the evening (it is normal to have many green plants and many mosquitoes. The hotel has mosquito repellent for use)
Children's play: The children's playground in the Hi Play Area has indoor and outdoor areas, and there are multiple sports venues. The facilities are very rich, basically covering children of all ages. The baby had a lot of fun in the three indoor venues in the Hi Play Area, and there was also a ground table tennis game for half an hour. It was really easy to walk the baby. It was a pity that it rained in the morning and I couldn't ride a bicycle to visit the park.
Restaurant: I only had the buffet breakfast on the first floor. Finally, there were more Chinese meals. The taste was good and I was quite satisfied. The key point was that many meals were very suitable for babies to eat, which saved me a lot of trouble [wit]
Room facilities: Baby supplies are very rich and detailed, with brand new baby shampoo and bath lotion, mosquito repellent, baby toothbrush, bed fence, bathtub... and the room movement line is very flexible. The baby likes to run around. There is no sound from the corridor and next door in the room. The sound insulation is super good.
I especially like Molly at the front desk, who made our trip convenient and comfortable! !

It is indeed a veritable parent-child hotel. Two sets of bathrobes are prepared for babies in the guest rooms. It rained on the second day of check-in, and the manager told us early in the morning to automatically postpone our check-out to two o'clock. And because we had a lot of luggage, the front desk also took the initiative to ask the concierge to help us move the luggage to the car, which was very considerate! The breakfast is rich in variety and very distinctive. There are not only homemade canned fruits, but also homemade hot tofu pudding and salt-baked quail eggs~ There are many kinds of entertainment facilities, and it is great on rainy days! The whole process exceeded expectations, and I will definitely come next time~

msg:It was the first time I took my baby out to soak in a hotel after he was born. The family of three was happy all day! The air and environment are really comfortable! I especially like the lavender shower gel! I'm really attracted to it!

I did a lot of research before booking to see which places around Guangzhou and Foshan are more suitable for strolling during the May Day holiday. I saw that Qingyuan New World provides various facilities, so I immediately booked and called to reserve baby beds, bottle sterilizers, baby strollers and other facilities! And I agreed in advance to reserve three seats closer to various facilities for strolling.

Fortunately, there was no rain when I arrived at the hotel that day. When checking in, there were also various staff members who helped to point the way. Seeing that I was holding the baby, they arranged a place for me to sit and wait üòÅ

After checking in, there were people who helped to deliver the luggage to the room, and the housekeeper took the initiative to add us on WeChat, which was convenient for communication, responsive to every request, and responded quickly.

The room is not big or small. Our pool faces the club, but the sound insulation of the glass is very good. When the window is closed, you will not hear the sound of cars/playing outside. The bedding is very comfortable, but the crib is a little low, which is not convenient for nighttime care, so the baby finally slept in a stroller, which is also very clean and comfortable.

The hygiene is impeccable and very nice. The design of the original stone is also very comfortable. I have to praise the brand of Rosewood.

The hot spring pool area is not large, but it is true that not many people go to the hot springs even during the May Day holiday, so there are not many empty pools. The design of the garden is full marks, which really gives the guests a feeling of holiday recharge and relaxation. There are no other hot springs that provide any medicinal materials, just pure enjoyment like Japan.

PLAY Children's Entertainment Experience: It's a pity that it rained the next day and I didn't enjoy it, but I don't expect that there are any facilities suitable for four-month-old babies. I hope that the next time I visit, the weather will be good to discharge.

The buffet breakfast is very rich
It is recommended to remember to order breakfast when booking a room
Didn‚Äôt eat the buffet dinner at the hotel
Go to a nearby farmhouse to eat
There are a few hot spring pools.
But there were not many people there yesterday, so it was quite comfortable to take a dip.
The room was also very clean and there were no negative reviews.
I am still very satisfied with this trip

I hope I can experience it next time! The bedding is very comfortable. They even opened a sofa bed for fear that we would be crowded. The service is first-class and at the level of five stars! The breakfast is quite rich and tends to be Western, but there are also morning tea snacks that suit the tastes of Guangdong people. Overall, I am very satisfied! The hot spring has a Japanese feel. It would be better if there were more types. There are relatively fewer pools! I hope there will be more fancy hot spring options! Five-star praise, I will continue to book next time

The dinner in the hotel's Chinese restaurant is good, and the set meal is very cost-effective. There are not many types of breakfast, but the taste is very good, chicken feet and freshly baked waffles are delicious.

There are not many hot spring pools. It rained heavily and it started to lightning after soaking for a while. The staff was also very responsible and persuaded us to go to the indoor pool for safety.

I added the WeChat of the housekeeper Ainsley when I checked in. During the stay, he sent us various activities and facilities of the hotel, which was very considerate.

The hotel staff stood in the public area to greet us, and asked if we needed help at any time. If we didn't know the way, they would lead us for a while instead of just pointing in a direction. The hotel also called us the night before the arrival time and requirements, and the baby stroller, crib, and baby basin we asked for were all provided when we checked in. The housekeeper, Haili, also added WeChat. He never greeted us in advance when we arrived at the hotel, and he was always responsive during our stay at the hotel. He also reminded us of the peak breakfast time, making us feel at home.
The hotel is indeed very suitable for bringing children! There will be an indoor shallow pool over there at the hot springs, and the temperature is about the same as bath water, so children can play for a long time. Kids club is more attractive to children. We all signed up for two classes, 98 yuan each, and there are also free ones. The children had a lot of fun and didn't want to leave. They said they would come again next time.

msg:Second time to New World (formerly known as Qianli)
Service is one of the selling points of this hotel. The staff here are very friendly and polite. They basically greet each other with a smile. I would like to especially praise Molly (hotel housekeeper) for adding WeChat when checking in. She basically "responds to every request" to help book meal times, introduce various activities, help deal with TV complaints, and upgrade the room type for free.

Facilities This is a hotel very suitable for parents and children. There are a total of 3 theme rooms for children plus a zero-gravity park. The maintenance is not bad. The children played for an afternoon after checking in.

In addition to the children's park, the fitness setting of this hotel is also very good. There is a tennis court and a basketball court. The key point is that the lights will be turned on at night, so you can play at night. Then the gym is small and exquisite, with Smith, gantry, and many equipment for core training.

The hot spring water here is of good quality. The hot spring area takes the route of small and beautiful, which is more exquisite (there are not as many pools as other large hot spring hotels).

The whole hotel is very quiet, and the tree shape is well-organized. Compared with Forest Sea and Xile Valley, it may not be so lively, but it has a unique flavor and is worth recommending.

msg:A resort hotel in the mountains of Qingyuan, with a beautiful environment and surrounded by mountains and water.
Hygiene: Very clean, in line with the five-star standard
Facilities: Complete entertainment facilities, everything you need for a vacation, there are basketball courts, tennis courts, etc. Good reviews!
Environment: Great landscaping design! Surrounded by mountains and fresh air
Service: The lobby service is not as good as a three-star hotel... But the restaurant service and various entertainment facilities are all very good! When we went there, I didn't know if the reception was busy or what. No one helped with the luggage, and the front desk was not very enthusiastic. The hotel was so big that they just sent a map and said a few simple words and then ignored us... For dinner, they asked us to take a picture of the menu. What special set meals and pool barbecues were all asked by ourselves while walking to figure out the approximate location of the hotel facilities.
Dining: The hotel currently has only one restaurant open, and you need to make reservations in advance if you want to eat pool barbecues. I tried the 598 double set meal recommended by the restaurant. The dishes were very delicate and tasted good. However, I really didn't understand the pricing. I knew that the price of eating in the resort would be higher. But to be honest, the price of this restaurant is really hard for ordinary people to accept. It uses fresh local ingredients in Qingyuan, but it is by no means precious ingredients. You can eat and the experience is pretty good, but it just feels not worth it after the experience.
Hot spring: There were fewer people when I went there and the experience was pretty good.

Overall it's good, suitable for a family to relax. I will come again if I have a chance! By the way, the hotel has good mosquito control üëç I didn't get bitten during the period, (because I went to visit the popular homestay next door on the last night and was almost ****** dry of blood:)

The hotel is relatively new and well maintained, with Rosewood's high standards of service quality. One-on-one butler-style service, the little butler Molly can always consider what I need in advance at just the right time, which is very considerate.
Surrounded by mountains and forests, the air is very good. Opening the balcony door and hearing the chirping of birds is super healing! I booked a stay package that included dinner. For a small fee, I could upgrade to a buffet dinner, which was very satisfying. The hot springs are open until eleven o'clock in the evening. If we choose to soak in the hot springs in the morning, there will be fewer people and a better experience.

It is rainy during this period, and the swimming pool area and camping barbecue area are not open yet. I believe that more experiences will be unlocked when the weather is nice.

PLAY (Children's Paradise): The children's paradise here is worthy of its name. It has multiple rooms and areas, a large area, and each indoor play room has a toilet. There is a small sand pool and an outdoor play area outside.
THE DEN: The venues mainly include archery, mini games, various indoor & outdoor ball games and fitness rooms. The main venues of THE DEN include archery, mini golf, various indoor & outdoor ball games and fitness rooms. Generally, a reservation will include 6 archery games and a half-hour ball game experience (mainly mini golf and table "football" for children who need to make a reservation). Other table tennis and table tennis games do not require registration and reservation.
Eat: The room we booked comes with 3 breakfasts and 3 hot spring tickets. For a family with big kids like us, it is really friendly and very nice. As for dinner, since the Chinese restaurant in the hotel is on the expensive side and not very cost-effective, we ate at nearby farm-style restaurants. There is a street full of restaurants 5 minutes away by car from the hotel. They are relatively clean and the prices are normal for those near the hotel. Bar.
Overall, it is still very good and very suitable for families with children. But I also mentioned some areas for improvement: the service awareness of the waiters needs to be strengthened, and the way of hospitality needs to be improved.

The room was very large, and the bathroom was also very large. There were two sinks, so I no longer had to queue up to brush my teeth.
	
[Hotel Hot Spring] 9:00-22:30 There are indoor and outdoor hot springs. There are not many pools. There are about 10 outdoor pools at a glance, and there are 2 larger indoor hot spring pools. The public bathhouses in hot springs have doors. Although there are not many hot spring pools, it is relatively clean overall. Although the hot spring area is not big, it is not so troublesome to walk around. The only drawback is that there is no rest area in the hot spring, and no simple biscuits or snacks are provided. I feel hungry every time after bathing in the hot spring.
	
"Happy PLAY: Children's Paradise" The children's paradise here is worthy of its name. It has multiple rooms and multiple areas. It is so large that children don't want to leave. We have booked a baking course in advance, but we need to pay 128 yuan per child. This course is about making small biscuits, with a young lady guiding us. Parents can free their hands. After the biscuits are baked, the young lady will help you pack them. In addition to baking courses, the children's playground has a wave pool, toy room, music library (with piano, small guitar, African drum, etc.), and each indoor play room has toilets. There is a small sand pool, a small vegetable garden and an outdoor play area üõù outside. You can also borrow the hotel's balance car to play...
	
"THE DEN" venues mainly include archery, mini golf, various indoor & outdoor ball games and fitness rooms.
Generally, a reservation will include 6 archery games and a half-hour ball game experience (mainly mini golf and table "football" for children who need to make a reservation). Other table tennis and table tennis games do not require registration and reservation.
	
"Eat" booking includes buffet breakfast for 2 adults and 1 child (1 little finger for children under 6 years old or under 1.2m). As for dinner, the Chinese restaurant in the hotel is expensive and not cost-effective, so we ate at a nearby farm restaurant. , there is a street full of restaurants 5 minutes away by car from the hotel, and it is relatively clean. The price is considered normal for the area near the hotel.
	
Overall, it is still very good and very suitable for families with children.

There are not many people from New Year's Eve to the second day of the ***** New Year, and there is no need to queue up to use various entertainment facilities. The children's playground is not small, with several small rooms, which is more suitable for children under 8 years old. Also note two points: the private pool in the room is on the balcony; the badminton court glue is sticky to the feet.

There are urine stains on the toilet floor and cleaning needs to be improved. There are free drinks and seasonal fruits in the room. I also want to complain about the buffet. Dinner is 370 yuan a piece. In fact, either I can't afford it, or I feel that the food is not good in all aspects. As a legendary Japanese-style hotel, this may be the only time I come here.

The room has a private swimming pool, and the hotel is equipped with bath salts. If you are not enough to soak outside, you can come back and continue soaking!

The food in the restaurant is good. Except for the steamed Anhui fish that I ordered as a set meal, I was satisfied with the product but it was a bit expensive. The breakfast buffet feels better than the dinner buffet.

I just went to Dusit Conghua last week. There are many people in Dusit Hot Spring. It is a good choice to come here. I will choose this hot spring next time.

She thoughtfully explained the hotel facilities and itinerary to us, and also provided us with various discounts during our stay.

Environment: Needless to say, the environment is a Japanese garden style that I like. I went downstairs and took a walk in the garden at six o'clock in the morning. I could see staff cleaning everywhere. The buildings and landscapes designed by Japan's KKS almost all I saw were elements of Japanese gardens. , integrating the surrounding natural landscape into the garden, giving people an open and spacious feeling, integrating the landscape and artificial buildings, just like if it were my yard.

Special thumbs up to (Xiao Xi) for giving timely feedback and solving problems.

shortcoming:
1. The room may be too humid and the quilt is a little damp. There is a peculiar smell in the room. When I sleep, I feel like there is a pair of smelly socks next door. I hope it can be improved.
2. I tried using the room card twice to open the room, but I couldn't open it. I waited at the door for the staff to open the door.
3. The price of the Chinese restaurant is a bit expensive. Although it is clearly stated price, it is a bit outrageous. A bottle of Coke costs 38, which is not acceptable.

The garden design style, so the place here is relatively large, the green coverage area is high, and there are many trees and birds.
First of all, let me say that the service of every staff member here is very good!
Then when I entered the room, I felt that all aspects of sanitation were in place, and there were free drinks in the refrigerator (Picture 11), and drinking mountain spring water in cartons (Picture 4). It is very convenient for adults and children to drink! The bubble pool on the balcony is very big and comfortable!
After dinner, I took two children to the swimming pool to play. The area is not big but enough to play, and there are not many people.
The buffet breakfast in the morning is quite rich and delicious. Due to Saturday, it can be opened until 11:00. This is really good for me who wakes up late!
Take the children to PLAY Children's Entertainment after having breakfast. This is the children's happy children's world. There are balance cars, watering flowers, sand pools, slides and swings, such as outdoor and indoor slides. , painting with building blocks, playing musical instruments, etc., the interior is composed of three small rooms
We didn't go to the hot spring because the weather was too stuffy
Finally, I would like to complain that the bed in the room is really too small, only 1.1 meters. Two beds are put together, two big and two are squeezed together for a nap. It‚Äôs really uncomfortable to sleep, so I can‚Äôt sleep well. It‚Äôs the first time in my life to sleep on such a small bed. Go to The single beds in other hotels I have been to are 1.25 or 1.35, and there is no laundry basket in the bathroom, and there is no drying rack on the balcony, which is not very convenient.
Why do I only come now after I have collected it for a long time, because I saw that the bed is 1.1 meters, every time I want to book it, it makes me struggle... I guess the hotel can't rectify this problem. If it can be rectified successfully, how many times have I come to visit? There will be more.

There are many entertainment activities for children in the hotel (it is recommended to make an appoin**ent in advance when there are many people). The whole day is fully arranged. It is recommended to arrange farther away for three days and two nights.
The breakfast at the hotel needs to be improved. It is still far worse than the InterContinental Marriott. The price of the hotel is always the same, the service is good, and the food can't go down.

We went on a family trip. We wanted to choose Qingyuan New World Hotel (then called Qianli Hotel) last year, but due to the epidemic, we postponed our trip until this year.
Sure enough, this trip did not disappoint us. The hotel is large, the greenery is good, and the hotel lobby is also good.
I also like the layout of the room, especially the bathing pool in the room. It is very big. It is not a problem for a family of three to take a bath. I am satisfied.
The main point is to talk about the swimming pool. The water quality is very good and clear. The infinity pool in the valley also includes a heated pool. I really had a lot of fun.
The hot springs are also very good, and they are even reserved.
The food is also good, but the price is a little expensive.

msg:The decoration of the room is relatively new, and I like the style very much. You can take a bath on the balcony, but there are two or three bees, so you don't dare to soak for too long. After picking up the room at the front desk of the hotel, you have to walk through two outdoor corridors, so that you have enough time to exercise, and then take the elevator to the fifth floor. The smell in this elevator is super smelly. I don‚Äôt know if there are si mice in the elevator shaft. Have you not yet? The solution is not to take this elevator, because you have to take this elevator to go to the billiard room, children's playground, breakfast and front desk After the children finished eating a croissant and a bowl of porridge in the lobby, our family of three was lined up. The waiter told us that a child over six years old would be charged 98 yuan for breakfast. My daughter who is six and a half years old also received it. When I went to the restaurant, I brought her a bowl of cereal and didn't eat a bite. She said that she was full in the lobby just now üòì, and the breakfast was also expensive, with not many varieties and the taste was average. The quality of service does not match the level of decoration. I don't know how the price is set, maybe it's because the epidemic has been three years and I want to get married sooner...

Facilities: There is a corridor so it won‚Äôt be too hot in summer and you won‚Äôt have to worry about rainy days.
Although the hot spring is small, there are not many people. It is very comfortable. It is said that there are many facilities for children, but I have not gone to see it.


Service: There is a service of luggage delivery to the room. It is very convenient for those who are young and have their own mouth. Bring it yourself
Haili at the front desk was very welcoming. The sofa bed in the room was quite large, so I didn't need an extra bed.

2 large and 1 small pure hot spring experience: There are not many people in the hot spring. I didn‚Äôt want to take the baby into the water. It happened that there was no one when we went, so we took the baby to play together.
Breakfast: rushing for breakfast, I added someone to go with the elderly at home. It was not as amazing as I imagined. The shrimp dumplings and chicken feet were gone. Lao Guang said he was not very satisfied haha

msg:Because I came on vacation with my family and brought a 1.5-year-old child, I chose New World Hotel. The hotel management experience is really great! Before the car stopped, the brother who was working took the initiative to greet him and wait. Knowing that we will be taking the baby, she specially notified the sister at the front desk in advance (we are still directing my brother to carry the luggage) to prepare some room types for us. Originally booked a courtyard twin room, wanting to make it easier for us to get in and out. But considering the privacy issue, I changed the room type with extra money, and it is on the 4th floor of Building 2. The view and room are even better! Thank you, Miss, for your recommendation. I also prepared a map of the hotel very thoughtfully, and carefully explained our location and the location of each activity. But since we are really not familiar with the hotel, we forgot when we turned around üòÖ The signs in the hotel elevator can be understood as the design requirements for the style design concept in the hotel. The meaning of the floor is not something that the general public can understand at a glanceü•≤I hope it can be marked more clearly and understandably.

PLAY children's entertainment experience: There are 5/6 rooms, well-decorated with care, but the rooms are small and can only accommodate about 10 children. If there are many people on holidays, you may have to wait. but! I really didn't expect there to be a farm experience in the hotel! ! Ha ha! Each room has 1-2 staff members to register and remind for disinfection and sanitation.
Environment: The green area is very high! Makes the morning, the air is filled with the fragrance of green grass! It is also easy to attract mosquitoes in summer, but there is mosquito repellent in the hotel vanity.

Service: Butler service is good, can solve many difficult problems, service and people are good

‚Äº Ô∏èDisadvantages: This is the first time I have to wait in line for breakfast at a hotel. There are too few places in the restaurant, and the supply exceeds demand. For nearly 200 people, I waited from 9:30 to 10 o'clock before going in to eat... and then 10 :30 Closing stalls... I really don't understand this wave of operations... There shouldn't be such a problem in such a big hotel! There is also the problem of car charging piles. There are no charging spaces at 9:00 p.m., and there are gasoline trucks parked in the charging spaces... Some trams are already fully charged and are still in the parking spaces, and some are parked in the parking spaces without charging... ... Waited down there for an hour before the problem was dealt with... Should there be someone in the hotel garage to strictly enforce the bad behavior of charging parking spaces?
‚ùåLightning protection: Afternoon tea sets cost more than 300. It‚Äôs not delicious. It‚Äôs okay to take pictures, but it‚Äôs really not delicious at all... Macarons are too hard, and other desserts are mainly cream. One bite is full of cream , the melon in the fruit cup is raw and hard; the mango is raw, hard and sour; the papaya is also raw, hard and tasteless... Overall, afternoon tea is not worth it, it's better to order it a la carte well timed...

Although overall it is still good, but there are too many areas for improvement... I hope that I can see the improvement of your store next time...

It‚Äôs no problem to put the electricity on for half a day in the children‚Äôs playground. The open-air public hot spring and the design of the entire hotel are more Japanese-style.

The bathroom in the hotel does not have a children's toilet or a washbasin that is suitable for children to wash their hands. This may be a problem with the hotel's initial positioning.

In terms of dining, the experience was very poor. The day we checked in at the hotel was Chris**as Eve, so we ordered Western food from the front desk staff and ordered in advance, but we were told that we might be arranged to dine in a Chinese restaurant. However, we thought it was okay, so we accepted the arrangement, but when we arrived When I was in the Chinese restaurant, I was suddenly told that the Chinese restaurant was full, and I was arranged to enjoy Western medicine in the buffet area. It would be very uncomfortable if the whole meal was carried out in a very noisy environment, and the food standard was also very ordinary...
When we checked out, the hotel front desk staff also asked us how we were considerate during our stay, and we all told the truth. However, the front desk staff did not express any apology and just listened directly... (Why did they ask us how our experience was? ‚Ä¶)

This hotel stay experience made us feel that the hardware of New World Group hotels is first-rate, but the software is not up to par...

The soft details are also remarkable. Drinking mountain spring water, hand cream, tea bags, and mosquito repellent are all selected brands, which make people feel high-end and respected. In addition, the washing and care is also specially prepared for children. A low-irritation special product.
In terms of public facilities, there are ball games, children's playgrounds (some children's interactive courses, vegetable gardens, etc.), hot springs, etc. The scale is not large, but the advantage is that it is well maintained and will not be outdated. Mosquitoes are unavoidable.

Including double breakfast, many free activities in the park, the hotel's landscape garden is really great, it's raining but very comfortable, and it won't affect your mood, the breakfast is delicious and there are many varieties.

msg:In the past 2 hours from Guangzhou, there is no guide at the intersection of the hotel. It is a remote and quiet path to enter. We didn't even have a street light when we went there at night!
I searched around the hotel, and there are basically no takeaways, but there are quite a lot of farms.
We arrived at the hotel after ten o'clock in the evening and upgraded the room type for us. It also took care of my baby's nap the next day, and helped us delay check-out by one hour.
The room is very Japanese style and the size is also very large. The balcony bubble pool is also very large, there is no water limit, you can soak as much as you want.
The hotel environment is very good, the green plant area is huge, but there are also a lot of mosquitoes and bugs.
The pet-friendly hotel is very good. I see that many people bring their pets here. Next time, I will bring my little one here to play.
There are so many places for children's activities that the baby simply doesn't want to leave. The hotel staff are very enthusiastic about children, and will take the initiative to ask if the air conditioner will be too cold. It's just that the baby is too young to attend their classes.
The breakfast is pretty good, at least it's friendly to Guangdong stomachs. The meals are rich, and the waiters are very friendly. It is recommended to dine in the outdoor garden, full of comfort!
Because we have a baby, we only soak in the hot springs in the room, and we didn't go to the public hot spring area, so we won't comment much.
The drinking water in the room is packed in a carton, which looks good, but it is not easy to open.
The minibar on the first night is free, with juice, cola, and beer. I feel that the needs of children, mothers, and fathers are all taken care of.
Amway crazy about their bathrobes and bedding! ! ! This hotel is the most comfortable bathrobe and bedding among all the hotels I have been to.
The bathrobe is made of a very comfortable material, a bit like modal, very absorbent and skin-friendly, and there are also bathrobes for children.
The bedding is also very skin-friendly, and the soft material greatly improves the quality of sleep!
The only downside: bathrobes are not for sale! The front desk gave me the brand, but I didn't sell it all over the Internet! Stuffed!
I'll do it again, just hope the hotel sells bathrobes next time I'm here! ! !
I'll do it again, just hope the hotel sells bathrobes next time I'm here! ! !

A few small details, the hot spring in the morning, the waiter gave a cup of ginger tea, and there is a place where you can dehydrate your swimsuit. When I left, I had to pack my suitcase and take it off. The service from the butler Cherry is very good and considerate. He introduced the hotel's facilities Activities and Services. The hotel has free rental bicycles. We didn't drive by ourselves, so we rented a car to eat at the farmhouse and pick strawberries. The hot spring is very good, anyway, I wrinkled my hands hahahaha, the environment of the hotel is really good, I like the feeling that there are few people in the off-season, the breakfast is very rich, and I haven't tried other restaurants. To sum up, the real world is worth a 100-kilometer trip back and forth. If time permits, I will stay for two more days, and I will bring my parents to experience it next time.

A few comments: 1. There is a drainage tank beside the aisle outside the room, but it is not paved with iron nets, so it is easy to sprain your feet. 2.

Hygiene: The bathtub in the room is the cleanest I have ever seen, because it is in the woods, there is only a small grass mosquito, just wipe it harmlessly. The room is also very clean, and the sound insulation is above average. Because it is a resort hotel, sometimes there are children's voices.

Environment: The hotel is very new, and some planning of trees may need to be optimized. Unprofessional, no specific evaluation

Service: It was a bit cold that day, and asked the front desk if the heating could be turned on. The front desk patiently explained that because the air conditioner is a central air conditioner, if the air conditioner is in the lobby, the room cannot be heated. But the front desk provided us with a Dyson heater, which was resolved quickly.

The surrounding area of the hotel is relatively remote, but the restaurants that can be found taste good. It is recommended that more people come together, it will be more interesting in the hotel, there are many projects and venues for people to play downstairs

msg:Booked a double bed room for a weekend trip, and the staff at the front desk upgraded it to a courtyard double bed room for free. It's really amazing, and the afternoon tea tastes good too
The hot spring is also comfortable. Have a drink or two in the evening. The service attitude of the staff in the commune is very good! Especially I wanted mayonnaise very much. A staff member went to the kitchen to bring it for me. Thank you very much for making this trip a satisfactory end. The food in the hotel is very good. It will be the reason for my next visit.

Let's talk about the room first, the room facilities are quite new, there is a square bathtub on the balcony where you can take a bath! We traveled with a 3-month-old baby and asked the hotel to arrange a bb bed in advance. The room is big enough, very comfortable! There are also a lot of equipment in the hotel, and overall I am quite satisfied! The housekeeper Lin Huiling is very caring and follows up the whole process, thank you!

Central Lawn: Camping is allowed! We brought our own camping supplies to camp on the hotel's large lawn, and both adults and children had a great time!

Service: The restaurant and room service are very good, and there is a small cake for birthdays (it‚Äôs pretty delicious!) Very friendly to children! There are all kinds of things that children may use. Including children's toothbrush sets, bathrobes, slippers, bed baffles, etc. Requests can be made before entering the store.

Special thanks to Phoebe for his warm reception, who will remind us to make reservations for events and meals in advance, as well as all kinds of patient answers! It's our anniversary, the room type has been upgraded to a courtyard room, and we also got red wine and small cakes! Thank you Qianli!
Need to improve: I saw some nematodes wriggling on the ground in the bathing area of the hot spring area. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a sewer problem; on; the balcony lacks hangers or poles for drying swimsuits

msg:This is the second time I stayed at Qingyuan Qingqing Qianli Hotel, and the experience of staying this time was very bad. About burying a bosom friend for a trip to the hot spring together, there are a total of 4 rooms. I don't know that it is disappointing to return, and it is not worthy of the five-star management and service! First of all, I went to the front desk to check in at 3 o'clock on the day of check-in, and then arranged for us to stay in a room a little far away from the lobby. The view is overlooking the village, which is dizzy! (The front desk is also the main recommendation of Guodonglou than the fruit 3 rooms of my colleagues). So I asked to change to the 3rd building. The pretty girl at the front desk had to wait 20-30 minutes to check in first, and then waited for an hour, and got the room card at 4 pm! The front desk can check out at 1:30 p.m. the next day compared to me. I know that I have to check out before 1:30 p.m. when I call at 12:30 p.m. After supper on the night of check-in, I found no parking spaces in the hotel‚Äôs underground parking lot with my friends, so I drove to the side of the lobby entrance to park. The next hotel employee came over and told me that I could only park in the open-air parking lot outside the lobby. Our friend persuaded us to compromise, and later reported the real situation to the front desk and the lobby manager, saying that the guests can stop! The caliber is so inconsistentüëç. A friend turned to the hotel after dinner and encountered a similar parking problem. He also said that it was difficult to understand and unreasonable!

msg:Check in the day before the holiday, check in in the afternoon and wait in line for about two minutes. The staff has a very good attitude and has arranged the room according to the notes. There is a car to deliver the luggage to the room. The room is very large with a bubble pool, and there are 6 bottles of drinking in the room Water and mini bar are free (2 bottles of apple juice, beer, and Coke). The hotel is designed to be smoke-free. If you are addicted to smoking, you should make good use of the Coke cans. There are not many hot spring pools, divided into indoor and outdoor, and the entry process is a bit tortuous. If you go to the hot springs, you may be disappointed. There is no constant temperature pool, and there are non-standard pools outside. The water is not deep, suitable for parents and children to play in the water. There are many free sports in the hotel, including golf and archery. You can experience it in the afternoon. The gym is open 24 hours, and you can get in and out with your room card. I went there after 7 in the morning and there is no staff. The hotel's breakfast is not very good, and there are not too many choices, but it must be very good. You don't have to do it yourself for tea and coffee, just use voice control, haha.
It's worthy of praise: Whenever you see the staff, they will take the initiative to say hello, and if you have any problems, they will handle it for you. You don't have to go to the front desk yourself.
Areas for improvement: It is recommended to clearly mark the bifurcation point of the passage from the lobby to the hot spring; the passages on both sides of the lobby and the location opposite the elevator can be slightly brighter at night; the most difficult thing to understand is to go to the front desk of the hot spring, as long as you report the room number. To enter, you have to go down to the negative floor and report the room number again to get the locker hand card? The whole process is paper registration! Next time I want to try it for free, and the staff will suggest a cabinet for two people? The water drain in the shower needs to be improved. The water after bathing is soaked over the feet.
Facilities: The room door is not well locked after opening the door, and the water drain in the hot spring shower room needs to be improved
Hygiene: very good,
Environment: very good, birds and flowers
service: very good
Exclusive private pool experience: the family had a great time

msg:I checked in with my family on Sunday for one night. There weren't many guests, so it wasn't crowded and the experience was very good. The hot spring is open for a long time, and there are indoor and outdoor pools. The water temperature ranges from 35.36 degrees to 4***7 degrees, suitable for all ages. The pool is not big, and there is no embarrassment of soaking in the same pool with a large group of people. The hotel's garden design is also very good, with a new view at every step. If the weather is good, it will be very photogenic. The children's play area is enough for children to play for half a day. If it rains, they can also play indoors, such as in the picture book area, slides, Lego, etc. Anyway, there is no need to worry about insufficient discharge. This trip happened to be my husband's birthday, and the housekeeper Wendy thoughtfully prepared a free birthday gift, which made adults and children very happy. In short, this is a very suitable hotel for hot springs and baby walks. Recommended

I checked in on Monday, there were not many people, and there were very few people in the hot spring pool, which was very refreshing.
The hotel's dinner is very delicious (recommend the roasted crispy Qingyuan chicken), the breakfast is also rich and delicious, the mini bar is also free, and I gave it a five-star praise.
Let me talk about a little room for improvement: the paper was not checked in the room. When I checked in, there were only a few sheets of paper left in the paper box, and there was no refill next to it.

The whole family went on a hot spring trip two days and one night ago. Because of the weather, we actually didn't experience many outdoor facilities, but I will still give this itinerary full marks, because the service wife of the butler porter is too extra points. Although many hotels under large groups or many high-end homestays have a one-to-one butler system, but this time I think it is an angel butler. Picture 1 is the photo he took for me. I was able to apply for early room upgrade and late check-out during this peak tourist season. The most outrageous thing is that Xiaobao didn‚Äôt bring enough diapers. The housekeeper brother can help us to the staff dormitory You can buy it at the canteen over there. In this way, there are frequent problems when going out, old and young. Fortunately, this time they are all resolved satisfactorily. The food in the restaurant and the farmhouse music recommended by the housekeeper are all delicious. It‚Äôs just that the weather is bad, and many outdoor facilities have not been experienced. Picture 3 is full of gifts, which makes up for the regret of the rainy day. The water quality of the hot spring is good, and the design of the entire shower is the same as that in Japan, but I only experienced a small part of the hot spring pool, so I can only wait for the next time.

4. The room supplies are good.
5. The quality of the restaurant's products is excellent, and there are many types of breakfast, which is very exciting.
6. Japanese-style hot springs are good, and there are few people on weekdays.
mind point:
1. In winter, the air conditioner only provides uniform heating, and generally does not provide cooling. The room temperature cannot be controlled, causing discomfort and rigidity.
2. Asked for cooling in the room, promised twice but did not implement it, perfunctory.
3. The hot spring is slightly thinner.
4. When there are many people at the buffet breakfast, you need to wait for a seat.

msg:Qianli has been recommended by friends, and after the epidemic was eased, I finally had the opportunity to stay! The overall feeling is very comfortable. You can feel the hotel's attention to detail from the little tiger that the front desk gave to the baby when checking in. Before going to bed at night, I called the housekeeping depar**ent to change the pillow. When the waiter delivered the pillow, he saw that there was a child in the room. I went back specifically to pick up a Chris**as gift. All in all, the service was excellent and warm!
Afternoon tea is also highly recommended. There are many kinds and the taste is good. The three adults and one child could barely finish it. The main comfort lies in the environment. The family sat outside drinking tea, chatting and watching the sunset!
The children's activity area is very rich. I forgot to book a class when I checked in. When I remembered it at night, the only class I was old enough to book was already fully booked. If you're not in class, go outdoors. The outdoor facilities are enough for half a day, including swings, slides, trampolines, balance beams...
The only drawback may be the hot springs. I thought there would be more pools in the hot spring hotel, but in the end there were only a few small pools. Fortunately, the water in the bathroom was very large and hot, so it was not easy to take a nice hot bath after soaking in the hot springs. No matter how much you soak in the pool!

Because we arrived after one o'clock, when checking in, the little brother said that the room we originally booked had not been cleaned. Seeing that we were staying for two nights for the first time, he helped us upgrade to the supreme room. Then very patiently explained the map and various facilities of the hotel to us. The first impression given to guests is already very good.
Then let‚Äôs talk about the room. The supreme room type is about 4 to 50 square meters. The swimming pool is indoors. The indoor layout design is very reasonable. Because it is newly built, all aspects of the hardware are very new! I personally have relatively high requirements for hotels, and I have a very good impression of Qianli this time, so Qianli is definitely worth staying again!

I recommended various fun activities in the hotel. I was very friendly and helpful!

The hot spring ‚ô®Ô∏è is certified and is a real hot spring. We went to the hot springs at noon and afternoon. There were not many people. The prince had fun playing in the water. At the front desk of the hot spring area, there was also lapidem essential oil. The lemon smell was so good, haha! It just happened to be a Chris**as event, and it has essential oils, water, and essence for ¬•1,088, so I decided to stock up on a set, haha! Thanks to the ling specialist in the hot spring area for introducing this additive-free Japanese brand, highly recommended! The essential oil smells really good. I have too much toner at home, so Ling asked me to replace the toner with facial cream. Thank you so much!
Thank you at Qianli Hotel for letting us spend a wonderful and sweet Chris**asü§∂See you next timeüëã

Now the weather is still hot during the day, so choose to go to the hot springs at night. There are both indoor and outdoor hot springs. It is recommended to go to the outdoor ones. You can choose from several hot spring pools, large or small. The garden design is very exotic. Don't be too comfortable.

In Qingyuan, this one is unique. The facilities and supplies are relatively high-end, and the management level is completely up to the five-star international standard.
The buffet breakfast is rich, with many varieties and high-quality ingredients. The entire architectural design is integrated with the surrounding environment, which can be described as pleasing to the eye.
shortcoming:
1. As a 5-star resort hotel with 5 diamonds, it is located in the fresh hot spring area with a long history. It only provides a few public bathing pools, and the area of each public bathing pool is too small. The bubble pools are closely connected with each other, and each small bubble pool does not even have a wooden shelf for hanging towels. Customers can only put white bath towels on stones or on the ground.
2. The hot spring does not have access to the room, which is also a tasteless part of this hotel. As a hotel that attracts high-end customers in Guangzhou, at the beginning of its construction, the core demand of Cantonese people who love hot springs to soak in hot springs was not taken into consideration!

Environment: Although the hotel is not big, the details are well done. It is divided into many areas, and it also pays attention to protecting privacy. It is good
Service: This time, it happened to be Yuan Tian Sweety, a staff member at the front desk, who received us. I would like to give her a special compliment here. As soon as I checked in, I thoughtfully gave the children a little tiger gift, and also gave us welcome fruits. We were given a small gift to take away and made us feel valued. The staff in other areas are also very good, in short, the service is very good.
Catering: This time the room includes breakfast, and I feel that there are quite a lot of varieties, but the products in the steamer area are average, and the steamed meatballs, noodles, etc. are not tasty enough, too light. In the juice area, only watermelon juice is freshly squeezed, and the others are poured out of boxed juices. It feels like there are so many ready-made fruits, which can be matched with a juicer to allow guests to squeeze fresh juice by themselves.
Facilities: Staying in the hotel for a day will not be boring. Many activities can be experienced. The facilities in the room are also very complete. I especially like the mountain spring water in their home.
Sankeng Town is a frequent visitor. There are many B&Bs and the hot springs are very real. I will come back to Qianli if I have the opportunity in the future.

The mirror is always hot, keep looking in the mirror clearly.

Environment: Japanese garden style, you can find a place to take pictures everywhere, and there is a small lawn where you can camp and take pictures. When we arrived, there were people doing activities, and there was a bonfire party in the evening. It's actually quite big here, and I didn't have time to walk around every corner.

The swimming pool is not very big, but it's nice to take pictures. Every place can be photographed, which is very suitable for me or my girlfriends to travel. It's quiet here and the bedding is very good.

Service: The service is very good. Every staff member will take the initiative to help us when they see us walking around to find a place. They are very polite and enthusiastic.

The projects are all made by appoin**ent, which perfectly avoids crowd flow, and it is more reassuring to play during the repeated epidemics. Every place is well-designed, the hotel is very clean, there are plenty of recreational activities, and the indoor and outdoor activity center with more than 3,000 square meters will linger. There are also a variety of indoor and outdoor activities. Kids and adults alike find fun. There are 2 hot springs indoors and various small pools outdoors. The hot spring area is not very big, but it is chic enough, and the reservation system is enough.

Qianli Hotel, a subsidiary of Rosewood Group, has always wanted to come after seeing friends who have stayed there. The hotel is a Japanese light luxury style. The carefully planned gardens and green plants are integrated with nature in every place. Pleasure.
The hotel also has many entertainment programs, such as spa center, outdoor swimming pool, archery mini golf, billiards, VR, tennis and badminton, table tennis, beach volleyball, chess and cards, cinema and gym, etc. You will not be bored if you stay for a few days. Each room has a large built-in bathtub
It's very nice to have a drink while taking a bath at night. In addition, the service of the hotel is also very good, and the housekeeper Phoebe has thoughtful arrangements to help us book activities. Wherever we go, the staff smiles and greets us, and the requirements of the guests can basically be met. Has been included in my Best Vacation Places, like it

msg:very good experience
One day before check-in, the housekeeper Cindy contacted in advance and informed the relevant precautions and parent-child activity schedule
Because it is an appoin**ent system, it can accurately control the flow of people
Provide guests with the best experience

We booked two courtyard rooms
The hotel calls in advance to inquire about the needs of the guests
Eliminate the need for communication, coordination and preparation at check-in
Entering the room is amazing
There is a small courtyard and there is a bubble pool inside, you can sigh while soakingüçµ
Since we checked in late, we headed straight to the themed bubble party by the pool that day
The children had a lot of fun, and they also asked Cindy to book the hotel dinner in advance to avoid the waiting time. The hotel products are still very good.
Very delicate and delicious üòã
Take a rest after dinner and book a hot spring
There are not many people in the hot spring, the pool is very Japanese-style
And it is a real hot spring. After soaking, the body is slippery and very comfortable.

The breakfast on the second day is also very rich
The children were having so much fun that they were reluctant to leave
Pre-booked archery billiards golf‚õ≥Ô∏è
There are too many activities and everyone's quality is very high
Come according to the appoin**ent time to avoid too many people and the project cannot be played

Special praise for our butler cute Cindyüëç
Careful attention and reminders throughout the process
Finally, we gave our two little babies a cute souvenir
The family and baby are very happy!
The babies said they would come again next time

Finally, some suggestions for the hotel
1. It is best to provide more choices for hotel pillows because some people like to sleep a little harder or higher
2. The hotel's road signs are not so clear. For the first time, it is a bit of a maze. It is best to provide a guide map or a brief introduction when you check in because most of the staff gather in the lobby and rarely meet the staff on the road, so for the new arrival It is really easy for the unfamiliar to go the wrong way

Overall, it is still highly recommended! Because the facilities, sanitation, overall environment and service are quite good. Next time there is a chance to come again!

The table, the nearest nucleic acid point (Sankeng Hospital, free testing from other cities) can answer questions, which is very considerate. The rooms are arranged on the 4th floor of the 3rd building (the highest floor), which is very convenient. Downstairs are various recreation rooms (gym, archery and mini golf courses, billiard rooms, etc.), and it is very convenient to go to restaurants, hot springs, swimming pools and KHOS PLAY. Garden view, very quiet and private, because it is Monday, there are very few people. The hot spring area is not big, there are no fancy colors or hot spring pools of various flavors, but the real hot springs do not need these, and the skin really feels smooth after soaking. In addition to the large pool of 1.2 meters, the swimming pool also has a children's pool of 0.4 meters and a hot massage pool. It is very friendly, but the weather is a bit cold now, and the temperature of the mountains and waters is slightly lower when the sun goes down. The room has a private pool, which is said to be mountain spring water (not hot spring water), and the glass fence is equipped with curtains to ensure privacy. The bedding is very comfortable and the toiletries are also great. KHOS PLAY has three rooms, which are very cutely furnished. There are also outdoor facilities, balance cars, sand pools, and watering for various vegetables and plants. Children don‚Äôt want to leave after playing. There are not many types of breakfast, but there are everything you need, including snacks, noodles, pastries, fruits, yogurt and drinks. The products are very good. The elderly and children like it very much. , I miss it! The minibar is free, with two beers, two apple juices, and two Cokes. Yana was very friendly. She remembered our surnames when she met us in the elevator and greeted us. She also packed us water boxes and small candies for the children when they left the store. What can be improved is that the water in the bathroom is a bit slow, and there are one adult and two children's bathrobes (so that the pig teammates gave a children's bathrobe, only to find out later), if there is a good night milk, it will be even better. Okay (the child suddenly said that he wants to drink milk at night). The overall experience was great!

Secondly, what surprised us was the apple of the fruit, which was unexpectedly delicious.
In the afternoon, we had afternoon tea, which is really good for people who don't like too sweet, and can feel that it is not a child's play, and gradually feel the exquisiteness of this hotel in my mind.
The children's playground is also very suitable for young children. The Japanese design style is considerate and practical.
For dinner, we were also very full, and there was a dish that was rarely found outside.
You will calm down and feel that this hotel is exquisite and exquisite everywhere, which is very suitable for the exquisiteness that people come to experience when they are young.

The hotel activity information was also sent comprehensively, and a late check-out was arranged the next day. It can almost be said that Full housekeeping service, very good experience. I have to say that the hotel's catering, service and activity experience are very good, and the environment is very suitable for a quiet vacation. Although the price is not cheap in Qingyuan, it is indeed much better than the experience of Xile Valley. BUT suggests that if you can, you should choose a relatively small amount of time to go there. The bubble pool is indeed a little small.

msg:Seeing the black text on the Internet, I only know if it is dark or not after experiencing it myself. As the ceiling of the Guangdong hot spring hotel, the price of traveling off-peak every night is more than 1,000 yuan including breakfast, which is definitely much better than a one-character hot spring in Zhuhai. , Every room has a housekeeper to take care of the daily life, and the YANA housekeeper I met this time is definitely back in seconds, and will help us soon, and also very careful to help arrange birthday cakes, even on the way home, he always cared about us returning home Well, it's simply taken care of in every possible way.
The room has its own immersion pool, so the room area is quite large. The mini bar in the room is used, and the water to drink is the boxed mineral water that the hotel finds itself to manufacture, which is the standard configuration of five-star hotels.
Besides, although the hotel's hot spring area is not too big, at least it feels comfortable, without too many tricks, and maybe the hotel's facilities are based on reservation system and off-peak travel, so there will not be too many people in all the hotel's facilities. And the hotel has too many different facilities and activities, so it will never be boring in the hotel. In addition to the golf course, hot springs, archery, miniature golf and billiards, there is also a large area with children, which is definitely suitable for people with children.
In terms of food and beverages, the breakfast environment is very good, especially their white porridge. If you call room service and ask for 78 Mosquito white porridge, after trying their buffet breakfast, their white porridge is really soft. With side dishes, I kind of understand why The asking price is 78 yuan. There are a lot of farmhouse dishes near the hotel, you can explore it by yourself in the public x reviews, and if you have asked about the restaurants nearby, some will provide takeaways, and you can call for takeaways if you don‚Äôt want to leave the hotel.
Staying at Qianli with two breakfasts for less than 1200 yuan is really worth it, can't ask for more

        Two points are deducted for the pool and swimming pool, which are small and not enough for a resort hot spring hotel

There are also shortcomings, that is, the hotel road signs are not particularly clear. Finally, I would like to remind everyone that this hotel is regarded as the Qianli Hotel with hot springs, not the Qianli Hot Spring Hotel. Because the hot springs are very small, I went there in the middle of the week and at night. Basically, there are people in every pool, and there should be more people on weekends.

msg:Qingyuan hot spring ceiling? The ****s have been pulled üíî Let everyone avoid the pitüëá
        First of all, we arrived at the hotel at 1:30 noon. We were tired with our baby and just wanted to have a good rest. Unexpectedly, we went to the front desk to check in but told us that we would not be able to check in until 3 o'clock. This is the first time I have encountered such a situation in so many hotels. It really makes me feel bad. After the check-in, I can only go to the restaurant to eat and wait for the check-in. Before I came, I saw a lot of publicity notes about the restaurant. I was looking forward to eating a delicious meal to comfort myself. Some are normal, but there are only two shrimp dumplings for 58 yuan per cage, and only two chicken feet for 58 yuan per cage. Are you eating dragon claws? It doesn‚Äôt matter if the price is twice as high, the portion is at least half less than the outside, and cutting leeks is also quite cruel. It costs more than 400 yuan for a meal, and the cost is at most 20 to 30 yuan, and the profit is more than ten times. The key is not enough to eat.
         Checked into the room after dinner, and waited for about half an hour for slippers to be delivered. This service level is not up to the hotel level. The only thing worthy of praise is the little brother who pushed the luggage cart, the considerate service with the housekeeper Wendy, and also gave a small gift to the child.
        Besides the check-in experience, some hardware facilities of the hotel are quite good, and the green environment is quite relaxing, but the biggest bug in the room is the air conditioner. As long as you touch the balcony door, the air conditioner will automatically turn off, and the air conditioner has to be turned on dozens of times a day. The boss is also very good at saving money... I have stayed in so many hotels, but I have never tried such a strange design. I was woken up several times after taking a nap, and when I went out for a leisure vacation, I was worried about whether the air conditioner was automatically turned off. Really speechless.
       Besides, in such a huge lobby, there is only one trash can, but it is hidden behind a hidden wall, and it is almost impossible to find it without asking anyone.
       A hotel is playing tricks everywhere, does it take consumers too much...

msg:Qingyuan Qianli Hotel is the first time to stay at the hotel. The hotel is located in Qingyuan Qingyuan Hot Spring Mineral Spring Area. The surrounding area is very quiet. You can park in the indoor parking lot if you drive by yourself, and then take the elevator to the hotel lobby to check in. We are received by the beautiful butler, Phoebe, attentive. Introduce the hotel's various services, arrange extra beds, and send welcome snacks and fruits, thank you Phoebe! Room service is efficient and attentive! The hotel room is Japanese-style, clean and elegant. There are two sinks for the family to wash at the same time. The hot spring is also Japanese-style. It is a smaller hot spring pool, but it is very authentic and I like it better. There are Qingyuan chicken farm restaurants around the hotel, and the hotel also has meals to choose from. Share with friends in need.

Personally, I don't think the swimming pool is very big, and the breakfast is mid-range. Overall, it's still very good! Special thanks to Chloe for her attentive service, all kinds of warm reminders and reservation activities, and the room landscape she helped arrange is also very nice, and I have already recommended it to my friends! By the way, the hotel has done a good job in environmental protection, cups, toothbrushes, packaging boxes, water packaging, etc. are all environmentally friendly materials, praise!

Service: The waiters in the whole hotel are smiling and greeted warmly wherever they go, especially Phoebe, the housekeeper, who has attentive service and five-star service. This time, I brought my grandma and three children to stay here for three days and two nights. Not tired at all. With the help of Phoebe, the children had a lot of fun. The children didn't want to go home after playing. It is worth recommending. Next time we will come!

I feel that one stay is enough... The price of the Chinese restaurant is relatively high and there are few dishes. The buffet dinner seems to be nothing to eat, and it costs more than 300 people. It's not worth it. There is no farm near the hotel. It is always inconvenient to eat for four days and three nights... The hair dryer in the room is very tasteless, and the hair can't be dried after blowing it for a long time... When you come to check in, you should directly ask the front desk to add a butler WeChat, butler Emma is very good, and she can meet many demands with children, which is very considerate.

There are not many people in the outdoor hot springs, there are not many pools, mainly small pools, and the weather is hot and rainy, and there are many bugs. Fortunately, there are indoor pools to remedy the situation. The overall is quite clean and the service is also very good. Regarding the facilities for children, it is more suitable for children under the age of 6. I participated in a paid croissant bakery, and I felt that it was not worth it, and the sense of participation was not strong.

msg:The whole hotel environment is very good, Japanese style, the details are well done, it is very suitable for vacation and relaxation, the vegetation coverage in the courtyard is very high, it can be seen that the garden is carefully designed, but there are relatively many mosquitoes. For the interior of the hotel, the interior public areas are well designed, but I personally think that the interior of the room is a bit ordinary, and the area of the specially selected supreme room is still slightly smaller. This time, I stayed in the innermost room in the first building, which was relatively quiet, but it was a bit far to walk to other areas. It was tiring every time I walked back and forth. It took a long time to ask room service to deliver water and pillows.

Personally, I prefer indoor pools in the hot spring area. The outdoor pools are relatively small and too dense, and there is no sense of privacy. The pool is not bad.

The environment of the restaurant is very good, especially it is very comfortable to sit outside. The taste and production of the dishes are also very good. I have tried breakfast, buffet dinner and a la carte dishes, which are better than expected, except for the slightly higher price. Very satisfied.

KHOS Play (Children's Playground) is quite a surprise, the place is quite big, there are no people on that day, almost the venue is reserved, and the children refuse to come out.

The service is quite attentive. When booking, I made a note to celebrate the birthday of the child. I thank Sweety for preparing a small cake in advance, and a small gift when I checked out. Except the front desk swiped the wrong deposit when I checked in and almost didn't return it, everything else is quite satisfactory and will come again if there is a chance.

msg:In the name of Rosewood Group, the name is not true, and it will subvert your perception after moving in. Remind friends on Ctrip not to jump into the pit.
First: When I checked in, I originally booked a deluxe king bed room. Later, the girl at the front desk said that the king bed room would have to wait until 3 pm. If you upgrade to the supreme room, the room will be more comfortable for only 300 yuan more. With the money, I could move in right away without waiting, so I happily agreed. Surprises came one after another when I went to sleep at night. The air conditioner in the king room was blowing loudly. I called the engineer to adjust it. The engineer fiddled with it for a long time and said that it was recommended to turn off the air conditioner to sleep. On a hot day of 30 degrees Celsius, turn off the air conditioner? Just asking if you are a joke sent by the monkey? Negotiations with the front desk were fruitless, and people were dispatched, so that was it. I only made a wall with a few pillows to hide from the wind. In the middle of the night, a few moths flew out from under the bed or from the cupboard. One of them landed on my nose, which scared me half to death. At that time, I really wanted to run to the hotel lobby impulsively. Get mad! I felt extremely uncomfortable after not sleeping all night. After checking out, their lobby manager saw that he had been systematically trained to speak in a certain way and said that he would come over and help me change my room next time so that the blowing was not facing my head. I thought to myself that since there was something wrong with it, Why wasn't my room arranged last night? Next time, is there a next time? I'm here for a vacation, not to suffer. Isn't the starting point of your hotel to serve customers well? Why don't you think of changing the customer's room as soon as this problem occurs? Can you still be a little more responsible? This is the most fatal flaw of a so-called high-end hotel, which directly affects the customer's living experience.
Second: The Chinese restaurant in Qianli Hotel is the worst restaurant I have ever eaten in, bar none. The taste of the food is quite weird. I also discussed this matter with the hotel manager, but the hotel manager said, is the food in our hotel unpalatable? You were the first to mention it. No customer has told us that the food in our restaurant is terrible; it‚Äôs really shameless ******! When the hotel manager says this nonsense, why don't you go to Ctrip and Xiaohongshu to read what everyone says about your restaurant's dishes? Does the guest know how to use Ctrip or Xiaohongshu?
Third: Hygiene: The bathtub was not clean. When I checked in, I found a big fly dead in the bathtub. The layer of dirt in the bathtub was not cleaned. In the end, I rinsed it with water myself. Later, I thought about it and ended up not using it.
Fourth: There is no service at all. It is called butler service, but the butler hair is not visible. There is no so-called welcome fruit, not a single wild fruit. Moreover, there was no drinking water in the room. It was even slower than a snail to bring water, and I had to rush several times. A so-called five-star hotel only has 2 sets of Kung Fu tea sets, and they are gone once you borrow them.
Fifth: Selfless hot spring, many people complain about this on the Internet, and there are very few public hot spring pools, only about 10. Except for the size of each pool, the temperature and other factors are all exactly the same. The thermometers are all broken and the display The temperature is inaccurate.
It wasn't until I checked out the next day that I reported this series of issues to the manager, but the hotel manager just tried to deal with it.
      This hotel has no sense of service, substandard sanitary conditions, and the food is terrible. It‚Äôs up to you whether you want to go there. I can only help you get here.
(Finally, I would like to add that there are a lot of mosquitoes in the room, and there are also little praying mantises staring at the sofa, which frightened the children. My hands were shaking and I couldn‚Äôt take the picture clearly)

The Rosewood product is indeed well-deserved. The most important thing to bring children out to play is cleanliness. The hotel has done a good job. The housekeeper, Phoebe, is conscientious, gentle and thoughtful but not excessive. The children will definitely come again. Of course, it is better to come here in autumn and winter, and now the vegetation is too lush I can't bear it anymore. There are a lot of farmhouses around. Children will definitely like it.

The outdoor environment for breakfast is quite good, but the variety of breakfast (weekdays) is not rich enough. In addition, the third building we live in is a little far from the parent-child paradise. If you are bringing a baby over one year old, you have to walk for 5-10 minutes.

Overall, I feel that it does not match the price at all. When I come over the holiday, it costs 1988 yuan for an ordinary room, and I have no five-star feeling at all.

msg:Go to Qingyuan Sankeng and miss the hot spring area more than 20 years ago. I feel that it is not as lively as the "ancient" time, but this hotel can basically have the function of a 5-star resort hotel. Some of the hardware is very good. The food is good, especially the breakfast. It's strange that Mengniu is used for breakfast yogurt. Isn't this the standard of an express hotel? Fortunately, there is a tide-style fried fish skin remedy that few 5-star hotels can provide.

üîîService: The overall staff is very friendly to you. The service of Yuan Tian Sweety at the front desk is enthusiastic. If there is any problem, it can be solved as soon as possible, very thoughtful!

The breakfast in the restaurant is also very rich. Dinner feels that the dishes can be improved.
The children's playground is also well done. It is a better parent-child hotel around Shenzhen.

Advantages: Most of the praise I gave is because of the children's playground. This is open for children to play for free. There are three cabins, including vocal music, wave pool slides, books, everything. There are also swings, single-plank bridges, and sand pools outdoors. Anyway, my son refused to go. In addition, the sports facilities for adults include sand volleyball, tennis court, golf putting (free for half an hour), bow and arrow (free for half an hour).
Disadvantages: Place an order in advance on Ctrip, and then go to the front desk to add the difference to upgrade the room, and you need to pay the full room fee. Although it is a hot spring hotel, the hot spring facilities are not perfect, and many aspects need to be improved, such as the hot spring pool water temperature is not enough, there is no shelf to hang towels, and I am even more surprised that there is no constant temperature swimming pool, which does not match the hotel positioning, hope Improve.

I have stayed in Macau's Ritz, Marriott, Galaxy, Wynn Palace, Banyan Tree, Londoners, etc., but I couldn't go there because of work reasons last year. . So this year's spring outing can only take the baby to Qianli for a walk and feel the nature. Checked in on March 19, probably because the spring is full of pollen, and the child is allergic to it, so after playing in the hi play area for less than 5 minutes, he was allergic to pollen, and his face became red. The staff immediately understood the situation and said whether it was We need to send a car to the hospital. As parents, we know the reason and tell the staff to buy Carritan allergy medicine and eat it. The staff will send Dashenlin to buy it and deliver it to the room about 20 minutes later. This is really fast. It is in line with the standard of an international 5-star hotel. The solution is very fast and in place. The key is that I am surprised. Maybe the hotel has remarks about the situation of each room. The staff in many places in the hotel these two days Everyone will ask if the child's allergies are okay, this feeling is very warm, and this situation has never happened since the Macau Ritz. It is worth recommending a hotel for everyone to travel with children. The level of hot springs is not bad and quite distinctive, and it feels the same as the homestay I stayed at the foot of Mount Fuji in Japan. I am afraid that only Qianli Hotel can find this feeling in Guangdong. Special thanks to the caring service of the staff Arvin! Awesome!

The staff here are professional, attentive and enthusiastic. The whole family reaps relaxation, joy and fond memories.

5) The hot spring pool is very authentic. It takes a Japanese-style delicate route. The water quality of the spring water is particularly good, and it is a rare real-time flowing spring water. It's hard to come by. We are in peak season during this time, but the number of people in the hot spring pool is well controlled.

The drinks and wine in the room are provided, and the amount of water in the drinking water is a little less. If one of the customers drinks a little more water, it may not be enough. The paper in the room was left over for a guest. We didn't make it up when we stayed, and it disappeared after a few uses. This is one of the few flaws. The price is small.

I didn‚Äôt expect the floor to be completely non-slip. After checking in, I almost fell down a few times. I paid special attention to the result and still fell to the waist dislocation. If the elderly and children encounter these consequences, I dare not imagine. The balcony SPA pool is still leaking, which is a very bad experience. Be careful of your personal belongings in the public area. If you forget your new toy on the sofa in the public area, you can‚Äôt find it in a blink of an eye. Ask the cleaning front desk staff. If you reply and ask, there is no result, and there is no responsible follow-up attitude. The theft rate here is simply worse than on the streets of Milan. After the accident, I contacted the hotel manager and told me to add WeChat for follow-up, but his follow-up method was not to reply to the message at all. This kind of attitude made people worry about the safety of life when staying in, and the a**osphere was too weak to complain. I have never experienced such a bad hotel.

msg:Stayed for three days and two nights, the housekeeper cherry is really considerate, reserved the venue, and solved any problems during the stay in time. For example, if it rained suddenly, I couldn't arrange the original outdoor activities, so I immediately booked an indoor VR; the room didn't put welcome fruit, and gave me a small cake. I was very satisfied with the check-in. A hotel where you can entrust your child to the kids club and adults can rest well. I would also like to commend the aunt who cleans up. Her attitude is not very good. On the day of check-out, she greets her warmly and is very comfortable. It would be nice if the hotel could replace the smart toilet cover, it is really too cold in winter. And the hotel sign is still not very clear, I always get lost.

msg:Haha, except expensive, everything else is good!
However, it is true that you get what you pay for!
 Worth recommending, willing to go again!
Very suitable for parent-child travel, couples are also very good.

üöó Transportation: By car, it takes more than an hour to reach the hotel from Guangzhou. Very convenient. There is a parking lot downstairs in the hotel, but it is not very big, and there are also several open-air parking lots.

üçÉEnvironment: The hotel has a good environment, I live in one building, and there is a creek looking out from the balcony. You can take a rest by the stream. It is more comfortable to sit during the day. But there are few people at night. I moved in on the 31st, and there are not many New Year's Eve people.

üßπ Hygiene: All aspects of hygiene are in place. I didn't see any uncomfortable or clean places.

üîîService: Service is the highlight!
The housekeeper will contact you the day before check-in. Will ask if we have any special occupancy needs. I will also release the price of what activities and projects the hotel has in the past. Proactively send the location of the hotel to facilitate guests to the store.
The service of Lily, the butler who stayed at this time, was quite good. All hotel activities need to be booked in advance, so that you can start off-peak activities. You can directly call the front desk to make an appoin**ent. Because I added the butler WeChat, basically all activities are directly booked by Lily for me, which is more convenient.
There are drinks, snacks and red wine in the room for free (included in the room rate), but a little detail I think can be better, the general star hotel butler will write a welcome card in the room to the guest Yes, not here.
The staff service in every area of the hotel is very good and enthusiastic! Only the outdoor tent area. After taking a walk in the hotel after dinner, I found that there is an outdoor tent area, which is very beautiful and can be regarded as a good place for Internet celebrities to take photos. We went to the tent to see it. It was very interesting. Suddenly there was a person who claimed to be a staff member (not in uniform). I asked her if she needed to take off her shoes when entering the tent. She had a bad attitude and said that we could not enter the tent. Did not go in, just took pictures outside), and then another group of residents came to another tent and went in. Then she said fiercely that they could not enter. After we took the photo, we wanted to go to another tent, and she immediately shut the tent off. We took pictures outdoors and her attitude has not been very good. This makes people feel that such a high-end hotel, is the service attitude so bad? Later, I told the housekeeper that the housekeeper said that you can go in the tent and take pictures. The person who claimed to be the staff was a travel agency. I am very sorry for being touched by something like this! What I want to say is that whether it is a hotel employee or a travel agency person, the person in charge of the hotel represents the service of the hotel. Such a poor service attitude (abusive) makes people feel very bad! The next day, I went to the tent area and wanted to take photos (about 11 o'clock). I thought that the previous night reflected that it would be better later. Who knew that the tents should be locked, and there was no opportunity to take photos. The next day is the 1st of New Year's Day!

The price of dining in the hotel is relatively high! There are 398 buffets, not many varieties. But don't miss it!
The breakfast was better!
In the evening, I still count down in the lobby bar. Drinks in the bar are not expensive, and the average cocktail per person is more than 60.
There are many activities in the hotel, and there is no time to play only in the hotel!
The hot spring area is not too big! The hot spring is not very slippery! But there are not many people. The room is quite comfortable. Living in Building 1, walked to the lobby and the activity area is a bit far away. It feels a bit like a maze.

Recommended! Willing to go again!
Hope to be more attentive in small details!

Before departure, I called the front desk, got the phone number of the housekeeper, added WeChat, and made a few requests. The housekeeper answered them one by one and tried his best to help me meet them. „ÄêSpecial thanks to Luluüå∫ and Juneüå∫„Äë

I want a beautiful environment
The housekeeper arranged to face the garden, the highest floor, the view is really first-class. Sitting leisurely ~ soaking in hot springs ~ refreshing ~

I want a hard bed and hard pillows~
The housekeeper also made arrangements, although the result was a bit ironic (the picture will not be posted), but the service of the housekeeper and trying to satisfy the customer's heart, I felt üëçüåπ.

The hot spring pool has a temperature display, and it is flowing water. I am not afraid that others will get dirty after soaking in the water. The green plant landscape is beautifully designed, and every place is a scene.

Mini golf, archery, table billiards and children's playground (I didn't play this time last time)... This place is really suitable for parents and children, and it can be done in one stop.

üöó Transportation: From Guangzhou, take Sankeng off the Guangqing Expressway, it takes about an hour and a half to arrive, which is very convenient.

üçÉEnvironment: I arrived in the afternoon on the first day. After arriving, I hung up the hot spring. After I came out, I only went to the children's amusement park. I didn't feel much about the environment. I took a walk after breakfast the next day and felt the surrounding environment. I took pictures and walked around. Stop and enjoy the slow pace.
üîîService: From the moment I got off the bus, I felt the enthusiasm of the service. The little brother helped with the luggage when I got off the bus. The check-in process was very smooth, although there were many people and did not wait too long. When I came back after dinner, I found snacks and fruits, which was a pleasant surprise.
üßπHygiene: This is what I care about the most. I have stayed in a lot of resort hotels, but I am very satisfied with the hygiene details. Whether it is the items prepared from the room, because there are children, I have prepared children's supplies. There are also very dry sheets, which is enough to prove that the hotel's hygiene is in place.
I have stayed in a lot of resort hotels in Guangdong Province, and I have also stayed in a lot of luxury hotels. So far, I have not found one that made me have the urge to check in again. Qianli is the first one. Even if it is Forest Sea, it feels like management. The difference is too far. The breakfast in the hotel is very good, and the standard is not lowered because of the place in Qingyuan. This can reflect the a**osphere of the hotel. Although the satisfaction is very high, there is still one place that I hope the hotel can improve, that is, the hair dryer is too heavy, and it does not dry hair for a long time, this is a serious deduction üòÇüòÇ,

The bathroom of the supreme room is very large, more than double the size of the deluxe room. Complimentary fridge drinks and fruit refreshments (mango mochi is delicious). Mineral water is packaged in paper, which is environmentally friendly.
The service is also very satisfying.

One day before departure, EASY, the front desk supervisor of the hotel, called me and asked me thoughtfully about my arrival time at the hotel and my room needs. When I checked in, I upgraded my deluxe twin room to a premium twin room, and also gave me snacks. The room, very thoughtful, thank you very much! I am very satisfied with this stay experience. It is the best experience I have stayed in various hotels for so many years. The hotel style is the Japanese modern minimalist style that I like. The design incorporates environmental protection elements. The stools in the lobby waiting for the elevator are actually made of rows of wood, which is very creative. The room is quite luxurious, and the bathroom is surprisingly large. It is also divided into several areas according to functions. There are wash basins on both sides of the long washbasin, and there is a dressing table in the middle. The hotel is clean, young and fashionable, which is very in line with the consumption needs of mainstream consumer groups. The buffet dinner on New Year's Eve was also reserved for me by the front desk supervisor EASY. The buffet is rich in variety and well-made. It can be eaten with the chef's heart. There is a whole big roasted pig, and there are also stewed sea cucumbers with medicinal herbs... In short, everything is good eat üòã

She knew that we were traveling on a anniversary this time. Not only did she help us adjust a room with a view, but she also brought us cakes and red wine. During the stay, she was very attentive and asked if we were satisfied with the stay, and if you have any requirements, please contact her at any time. The weather is cold at night, so warmheart reminds us to wear more clothes when we go to the outdoor hot springs. Because the child wanted to play more the next day, messaged Felicia to ask if a late check-out was possible, and she arranged it for us immediately. Surprisingly, the breakfast buffet here has many varieties and tastes good. Although the hotel hot spring does not have petals, milk and Chinese herbal medicine pools, it is suitable for a family to soak in a pool, avoiding the embarrassment of being with strangers. There are not many pools, so it is better to avoid holidays as much as possible. The hotel's free programs are also very fun, archery, nine-hole mini golf, table tennis... Finally, thank you again Felicia!

Thanks to the lobby manager, Terry, for contacting in advance to arrange the event. You can make an appoin**ent with him at any time. Welcome fruits and cakes are delivered in the evening, and snacks are delivered at the checkout, which is very nice.
The only suggestion is that the bathrobe provided in the room is too thin, and the cooling is really unbearable. You need to change it to a thicker one.

msg:The first time I stayed at Qianli Hotel, I felt the professionalism of the staff. As soon as I entered the hotel, there were staff to help with the management. The female manager who checked in to receive us was the female manager who arranged the room for us very carefully and provided us with many services in the evening. The hotel has carefully reminded us of the battery change several times, and also explained the hotel facilities and catering in detail for us! When changing the battery at night, my husband and I just finished soaking in the hot spring and wanted to go back to the room. When we came out of the hot spring, the female manager brought a flashlight and sent us back to the room. When we returned to the room, we also delivered fruit desserts and cakes. It was super pleasant and sweet! It feels like a family, like going home, caring about every bit of the guests! It's really great! In the evening, I had dinner at the Chinese restaurant in the hotel. The hotel-level quality is unbeatable. You must eat the Qingyuan white sliced chicken. It is super smooth and tender. The breakfast on the second day is very delicious and many choices. At the end, a male manager asked us when we checked out. The next stop is going to be there. We said we were going to Gulong Gorge. When he heard that it was an outdoor mosquito repellent that was sent to us, my God! It was so sweet that it exploded, and sent us to Shuchechang to help with the management, etc. We will come back next time when we are free!

There are not many hot spring pools, because the reservation is divided so that it will not be crowded, it is completely enough, and the hot spring changing room is hygienic and convenient. Unexpectedly, it can be said to be the best parent-child hotel in the province. The billiards, mini golf, and archery are all fun, and the indoor and outdoor amu*****t facilities are complete and well-designed to meet the active nature of children. There are full of all kinds of manual activities. A full set of children's toiletries are also prepared in the room, which is very considerate. After check-in, there are small snacks and supper desserts in the evening. The design of the hotel is elegant and elegant, the environment is beautiful and meets my hygiene requirements, the staff is professional, and the front desk will be satisfied quickly if there is a need.

Although it is the New Year's Day holiday, the hotel rooms are full, but no matter the breakfast or the hot springs, it will not feel crowded or uncomfortable.

A Japanese-style hot spring hotel that has been open for more than a year. The room is big enough, clean and comfortable.
There are plenty of parking spaces, garden parking and underground parking, which are convenient.
The hotel is rich in entertainment activities, including archery, billiards, tennis, and parent-child activities.
The hotel has a rich breakfast, with Chinese and Western restaurants for you to choose from.
Special thanks to Allen Mo, the guest service manager, for arranging a room close to the hot spring very carefully and introducing the hotel‚Äôs restaurants and facilities in detail. And reminded that the hotel room was full that night to book a hot spring as soon as possible and free to help make an appoin**ent, and deliver fruits and snacks in the evening. Caring service, great üíù
Although the hot spring area is small, it is very Japanese style. Make appoin**ents and limit the number of people. This measure is really important üëç

The room facilities are newer, and the staff service is more attentive. There are few pools in the hot spring area, the pools are relatively clean, and a little bit of fallen leaves can be seen to the naked eye. The overall experience is still very good when there are not many people. There are abundant activities arranged, suitable for a family or friends to go together. The food in the Chinese restaurant tastes good and the output is stable, but the price is slightly higher. The butler is very enthusiastic about tracking the problem in place in time.

msg:Everyone knows that when I came to Qingyuan,
The most recommended near one point is this Internet celebrity Japanese-style hot spring hotel
As soon as I drove in here, I felt that the environment is really good. The overall architectural style of the surrounding green hotels makes me feel that um, this trip is not white to take pictures and it is particularly good. When I saw the lobby, I felt that the waiter with the luggage was special. The expressionless face is as if I owe him money. This makes me feel that this is not the service attitude that a welcoming person should have, and then I arrived in the lobby. Yesterday was Wednesday. Many rooms were not so full. Last time, several friends came and upgraded. So I asked if I could upgrade the room type with the attitude of trying it out, so the waiter gave me a disdainful attitude and then told me that upgrading the room type required additional money. It made me feel as if I could not afford a hotel. It didn‚Äôt matter. I don‚Äôt need to upgrade, but your attitude should be better because you are a five-star hotel. The environment is the first and the service should be the second, right? After all, I didn‚Äôt spend money to play to see your face? Right? Then I went back to the room and wanted to take a bath in the private pool on the balcony üõÄ So I called the front desk and said that there was no plastic sleeve to ask someone to come up for disinfection. Right? How many bacteria are in it?
Then last night I ordered the takeaway and called the hotel to ask if I could let the welcoming guests be delivered. I‚Äôm pregnant and it‚Äôs inconvenient. She said, oh sorry, we are here to get it. Even the four-star hotels have robots to help deliver the food to your five-star hotels. Even the most basic food delivery service does not have a store to bully customers, right?
For breakfast this morning, I called at 10.37 and said that I couldn't eat anymore, and my attitude was extremely bad! This hotel really bad service attitude ü§¢ü§¢ü§¢ü§Æ
I don‚Äôt know how those bloggers post it, but I think if you want to take a picture, you don‚Äôt care about the service or get angry. ‚ùå
There is nothing to eat in the hotel at night. There is only one takeaway nearby. You can order that one. The taste is okay. It‚Äôs impossible to find a convenience store near the hotel.

Location traffic:
Very remote, the night road is dark and there are no street lights, you must drive around to find food
Serve:
Very bad, really very bad, I suggest retraining all of them or adjusting the monitoring and spot checks

parking:
The location is adequate and the vehicle is adequate
My evaluation is very pertinent and good things I will not ignore, but the service is really bad and not worth the price. I know you are a new hotel, but the most important thing about a five-star hotel is the service attitude. Customers who spend so much money to come out to play must be For happiness and nothing else
With this experience, this hotel will not come again in the future!

Similarly, there are not many types of hot spring pools, but the design is very exquisite, and the designer‚Äôs careful machine is revealed everywhere~ It is very suitable for three or five friends to have a hot spring and chat together~

msg:I went for a walk on the Double Ninth Festival and chose to compare the Internet celebrity hotel Qianli. The halo of the Rosewood sub-brand is destined to be a high-end positioning. All the facilities are in line with the five-star configuration. The hotel rooms opened in 2020 have no technology at all, and the toilet panels are so cool. The waiter emphasized that the room was a bathtub instead of a pool. It was a bit disappointed that the hot spring hotel did not have a hot spring. After all, I used to go to Japan to go to the hot spring. It is said that there is a Japanese hot spring certification, but the fact is a little bit different. The Japanese hot spring hotel is indeed a small bathing pool that does not have various flavors, but there are two separate baths for men and women. There are two separate venues for indoor and outdoor bathing pools. There is only one venue and 200 rooms for use. It is recommended Don't come on holidays. The room encountered a problem with the sewer, and the feet have been soaking in a bath, and the toiletries still need to be pressed in the correct direction. But the response was quicker, and the manager also sent a red wine cake. The Chinese food at breakfast is not very good. The chicken feet ribs, fish eggs and beef balls are all wholesale. If you want to eat, you will give up after a bite. The western part is great, the waffle doughnuts are very good, and the fruits are very fresh. tasty. The overall service is good, the hot springs are average, and parent-child activities are quite abundant.

It must be five-star praise! The service is really good. Every staff member seen in the hotel will actively greet and give directions to the guests. The service is basically responsive, and fruits and snacks are also delivered in the evening. The decoration of the hotel is consistent with the styles of supporting supplies, and the sanitation of the rooms and public areas is also in place. Both adults and children have their own amusement items, and the children are even more reluctant to leave. The hot spring area uses an appoin**ent system. When the rooms are full on weekends, the hot spring area does not see many people, and it maintains tranquility and comfort.

Qingyuan outside the hot spring is considered better and clean. After all, reservations are required. It proves that there are restrictions on the flow. The hot springs are not too big. But it does not mean that more pools are good. Park arranged the room for me in advance before check-in. Louie helped me arrange the meals after check-in. It made me feel at home. This kind of service and privacy can be provided during the National Day. It is quite satisfactory. There are more activities in the hotel. All need to make an appoin**ent in advance.

It's past 6 o'clock in the store, and many activities are over at 6 o'clock, so you can't play, the swimming pool is garbage, why do you need to make an appoin**ent to play? There are very few facilities, and there is basically no chance to play. I ordered more than 700 dishes for three dishes, and the taste of the chicken pot was not as good as the more than 100 dishes in the urban area of ‚Äã‚ÄãQingyuan. I was woken up by the sound of construction early in the morning. The children in the corridor were playing skateboards and no one cared. It was too noisy. Room service is extremely slow.

We are walking and swimming in all the comforts of the hotel. One soaked in the big bathtub, covered with bubbles, standing in front of the mirror, covered with essential oils. After bathing and changing clothes, the legs are raised high on the sofa, enjoying the night view while drinking red wine

msg:There are not many people going on non-holidays. It is okay to go for two days and one night. If you have enough time and want to take a vacation, it is not recommended.
Let's talk about the service first. We stayed for two nights. There was a note before booking the anniversary and birthday. As a result, there was no room decoration, not even a rose, no petals! I wanted to take a look at the suite first and consider adding money to upgrade, but at night the waiter told us on WeChat. I was very busy and would take us to see it tomorrow. This service was quite speechless. . On the birthday night, I had to call the front desk to decorate the room, but the front desk said that there is no such service! I said that the check-in attendant promised it, and the other party said he wanted to ask. I said if I could give a small cake, the other party said that he wanted to ask. . At that moment, the birthday I was worried about didn't even have a cake. I knew I brought it here. No, I didn't know it! In fact, it is just a sense of ceremony, this service is really disappointing! The room layout is two dolls and fake petals on the bed. . Another doll is given to you as a gift. . This is the star hotel with the worst room layout I've ever been to, no one! The candles of the cake are leftover by others, which is "environmentally friendly". . . As long as the cake comes, I don‚Äôt dare to expect anything else. Looking at other evaluations, it should be the same as the birthday cake. The only consolation is that the cake is delicious. The next day, I wanted to ask if I could bring breakfast to the room or pack it for those who didn't go. In fact, it was not the point. The point was that no one would remember to return to me after I asked. . . In short, all services are very passive, the only initiative is that the waiter asks if you want to turn down the second night. Before I came, I saw that some people said that there is a housekeeper, and there are some snacks, cakes, fruit and red wine to send. . Anyway, nothing! Almost no birthday cake! Recall that I was fortunate that I did not add money to change to a suite. The suite is usually 3000+ on weekdays, and 6000+ for two nights. . I'm really sorry for the price.
Then the equipment and food are average, the restaurant is expensive, the takeaway is small, and the breakfast is decent. The hot spring is really small, so I just treat it as a hotel with this activity program. There are so many people on holidays. I wonder if I can arrange for the tourists to take a bath. Don't come to the hot spring. Also, the square pool in the room is a bathtub and not a hot spring. I also misunderstood before coming. As a star hotel opened last year, the room equipment has no sense of science and technology, the electronic products are low-end, and even the toiletries cannot be an independent brand. It turned out to be an add-on style. I really need to complain. Of course, I don‚Äôt care about the service and these details. The room is comfortable and the stay is comfortable, but isn't the comprehensive product price the same as other local hot spring hotels?
Finally, let‚Äôs talk about bringing pets. You can go anywhere except restaurants and entertainment venues. But first, pets do not exceed 30 kilograms. In other words, only small and medium-sized dogs are accepted. The vaccine book and the original dog certificate are required. The charge is 500 yuan for cleaning. Regardless of the number of nights, whether the charge or the deposit is not refundable, that is, whether it is clean or not. Gotta give. . At this point, the pet is finely savoured by himself. I gave the money and only told what to do. There was nothing like dog kennels and snack gifts. I saw that the public account said that there were no free photos and costume props for pets.
In short, if the hotel is not said to be five-star, all of the above shortcomings are not shortcomings. There is harm if there is a comparison. And I went there on a non-holiday + typhoon + rainy day. Of course, it may be a coincidence that I encountered bad service, coincidence and coincidence. But still the same sentence, said it is a star, or a magnificent banner. . Then the hotel should be reviewed

msg:Before I came, I read the bad reviews of Ctrip first, and I was a little mentally prepared. I stayed for one night on the second day of the Qingming holiday. The car was in good condition from Guangzhou, and it took one hour and forty minutes to arrive. The hotel I arrived at after eleven o'clock was full the day before, so I didn't get the room so quickly, so I went for a stroll and had a meal.

Xuan Restaurant has a Chinese menu at noon. It is quite comfortable to sit outside, but the dishes are really ordinary and expensive. At about 1:30, I finally got the room, a deluxe courtyard king-size room on the first floor of Block 2. The room is not big, but the bed is really comfortable. At noon, I was too tired and just fell asleep. Not long after, my aunt came to deliver fruit, which was a little disappointing.

I woke up in the afternoon and went to soak in the hot spring. Indeed, as many comments said, the pool is very small, but the advantage is that there are not many people, so the experience is not bad.

The Children's Paradise is the highlight and essence of the entire hotel. Babies love to play and release their energy to the fullest. Just pay attention to some parents, the quality is really bad.

The buffet breakfast is good, the varieties and products are much better than lunch, praise!

Thanks again to the housekeeper Murphy, from before check-in to the entire check-in process and check-out, for helping to make reservations, communicating meals and itineraries, and the attitude and response are great.

Overall, it is a hotel worth checking in again.

First of all, in terms of environment, the hotel room is very design. If three adults can still stay in one room, there is a sofa bed in the room, so there is no need to open another room, which is more affordable! The overall air in the environment is very good and very quiet! In terms of facilities: suitable for children over 3 years old, many small outdoor activities, and the infinity pool is also very clean! But the hot spring is really too small, a little disappointed! In terms of service: I met a very nice lady at the front desk and a little brother Yingbin, and saw me traveling with a doll. They gave me various suggestions and sent snacks and cakes to the children! The service is very attentive!

The hotel is integrated with the surrounding environment, and the ecology is well protected. The most important thing is that the service is also in place. As soon as he arrived at the hotel lobby, the manager took a doll to his two-year-old daughter. It was very considerate. In the evening, he also sent small cakes to the room for the children, which was heartwarming. The hot springs are designed in Japanese style and have a natural feel.

I will definitely come again next time.

There is no place to hang bath towels and bathrobes next to the hot spring pool, so they can only be placed on the ground. This experience is not good because there are more mosquitoes in summer and may crawl on clothes or bath towels, and there are very few bath towels in the bath towel storage cabinet in our hotel. I wanted to find bath towels at 9 o'clock. There are only a few waiters in the third locker room. I didn't see anyone for a long time when I went to the locker room to ask for a hand. At the same time there are 3 guests are looking for service staff, this is not good. As I've been in other spa hotels are full of bath towels. Then there are places to hang clothes near the hot spring pool, and the service staff will pour ginger tea or emergency tea in a tray and bring it to the guests when the guests are in the hot spring. face], this experience is not very good. However, Ms. Easy at the front desk of the hotel has a very good service attitude and is very recognized. It is recommended that the hotel hardware facilities be improved.

Not satisfied, first check in. We checked in at the hotel at 16:15. It was very slow. There were 4 counters at the front desk, and it took 20 minutes for each guest to do it. I don‚Äôt know what we are doing! After registering for us, I was told that the room hadn't been cleaned up yet and I had to wait! This is a bit of a ********.

There are 4 small open-air tables next to the swimming pool and toilets. It is a western restaurant. It's funny! But the breakfast is still good, this one has to be honest üòä
Hot Springs: Very dissatisfied! The pools are few and small. It's hard to imagine what the peak season will be like. The pools and the ground are irregularly built with stones. Old people and children walk in fear when they walk. Why bother? ! A massage for more than 1,000 yuan is a huge pit, a huge pit! Believe me, no more explanation!
Finally, we booked the Supreme Courtyard Room, thinking that there will be a small bubble pool in the courtyard, anyway, there is a small bubble pool in the room type introduction, and it turns out that there is no one.

It is a Japanese designer's design. There are many wooden products and sofas. The lobby has more wooden products. Haha, it is different from the traditional luxurious five-star hotel, but it feels a bit similar to the Four Seasons Hotel in Japan. The design of the first and second floors of the building is also very Japanese!
There are not many pools in the hot springs. It is estimated that there will be more than a dozen. It is different from the domestic medicinal bath. It is made by appoin**ent and it feels very good. There are not so many people who are too noisy.
The restaurant is not cheap, but the five-star restaurant only has Cantonese cuisine. üò≠The food is almost the same, it feels like it's passable~
There are also many entertainment activities on the first floor. If you have time, you can make an appoin**ent to play games and play mahjong, but there is an additional charge üëè

On the whole, you can come to relax and relax. A more comfortable hot spring hotel ‚ù§Ô∏èYou can go out with couples or play with friends, and it is also suitable for families.

Terry, the lobby manager, called me the day before check-in and asked about the time of arrival, how many people are staying, and whether there are any children, etc. The next day, the check-in went smoothly.
Although the hotel is not very large, it is exquisite, with a view every step of the way, and the Japanese-style decoration is Zen-like and comfortable. The afternoon tea that came with the package I bought was very good, and the green coconut coffee I ordered was delicious. We can't finish eating for two of us.
The swimming pool is very beautiful. During the period, Terry, the lobby manager, will also answer questions. He also dines in the hotel in the evening. It is a very good product and spends two leisurely and comfortable days.

msg:In one sentence: Five-star hardware, three-star service
First of all, I brought my children because of the main parent-child hotel, but in fact, apart from an independent children's playground and a small children's heated swimming pool, I didn't feel the mission service and details of the parent-child hotel should have. When I came to the lobby from the parking lot, there was no service staff who took the initiative to guide us. The one we asked ourselves got very cold service. In addition to children's shampoo and shower gel, there is no toothbrush suitable for children, no mouthwash cup, and no bed circumference. The details in the room are very hygienic, there is dust visible to the naked eye, there are hair and black dirt on the sofa. Encountered the service staff in the hotel, no one took the initiative to greet us. The only one who is more enthusiastic is the young lady in the children's paradise, which is why she is in this position. The children's playground is divided into three cabins, and there is a fountain sand pool outdoors. The so-called free archery is to give you six arrows to do it yourself, without staff guidance or guidance, it is no different from the self-service provided by those farms. We all went for breakfast only at half past nine. There was no need to wait in line. The variety and quality were not lost. At the toast, because there was chocolate sauce on the first day, I didn't see it when I went the next day, so I asked the waiter at that stall, and she pointed to a bottle of peanut butter and said: Isn't this chocolate sauce? I said the yellow one is peanut butter. As a result, there is no more text, and I don't know who I am playing perfunctory. The overall feeling is very general, or the expectations are too high. If you are fancy focusing on parenting, the children's center might as well go to an amu*****t park.

After talking about bad service, it feels that many waiters are too young, and there are many service blind spots that are not mature enough and sophisticated. Secondly, as a new hotel opened in 2020, there is a lack of smart settings and supporting facilities. For example, if each channel area is an automatic door, it will be more humane. Too many people push the door and feel unhygienic. For example, a main Japanese resort hotel room or a traditional water tank toilet is too common. If it is a smart toilet, electric curtains will be more in line with the tone.

There are few hot spring pools. So the hotel will need to make an appoin**ent to control the flow of people.
Our package includes afternoon tea for two people and buffet breakfast. The product is also very good. The afternoon tea is quite large. It is enough for the four of us, so the hotel also allows us to use it after check-out the next day. These are star hotels. Only flexible, more able to listen to the needs of customers!

msg:Second brush Fengli Thank you again for the efficient service and caring arrangements of the Wilson manager. The room is super big, with bathtub and soaking pool. The children played both times and they enjoyed it very much. She also prepared a welcome cake for her and gave her a doll before leaving.
Every corner here can be a blockbuster üòÇ The three rooms in the children‚Äôs area are very beautiful, there are courses to play, and various outdoor and indoor activities can be reserved üëç

msg:First of all, to summarize, Qingyuan Qianli Hotel is very suitable for parent-child play.

The reasons are:
1‚É£Ô∏è The service attitude is very good. Basically, they greet them cordially. The children are more tricky and patient.
2‚É£Ô∏è This is also the most important point. The facilities and courses in the children's playground are very suitable for children of all ages. We took two kids and we had a great time.
3‚É£Ô∏è Sufficient equipment for children. Whether it is the children's tableware during the meal, or the bed circumference, crib, and children's toiletries in the guest room, they are all for families with children.

But the downside is that the size of the hot springs and swimming pools, and the entire hotel is not too big, so it is more suitable for parent-child rather than other types of travel.

msg:The hotel environment is great!
Checking in on Saturday, there may be more guests. In the evening, the waiter does not have the service level of a five-star hotel. Everyone appears to be very busy, but it can actually be carried out in an orderly manner. The restaurant at breakfast time also has the same problem;
The hot springs and recreational facilities are great!

Good ecological environment + garden-style design, fresh air and green surroundings; 3. Pet-friendly Hotel, the outdoor lawn is suitable for Wang Xingren to play; 4, the most important, recently launched a discount package, exempt pet cleaning fees, and give 880 no-threshold meal coupons, equivalent to breakfast, lunch, and dinner all-inclusive, which is simply too cost-effective Up!

msg:The hotel is beautiful, with clouds and mist when it rains. The service that can enhance the staying experience the most. The managers here are great, and at first glance they are excellent practitioners in the hotel industry for many years. Special thanks to the manager Amy at the front desk, who learned that we are bringing the baby in, specially arranged a baby cot, so that we can avoid the trouble of spending time to settle down after check-in. Special thanks to the manager Emma at the front desk of the hotel. On the day of check-in, the check-in procedure was completed at 10:58. When I learned that the restaurant was off work at 11, I immediately asked the front desk to call and order food. But the chef said it was off work. When I was still worried about nowhere to eat, the emma manager took the initiative to help us contact for supper, which made us eat dinner! The service of the hotel is really great! The design style of the hotel has the environmental protection concept of logs, but it is not lacking in modernity. The background music in the lobby is also great. This is a hotel that combines nature and modernity, suitable for weekend vacations, company annual meetings, and also suitable for bringing children. The hotel‚Äôs restaurant is great, and the chef is very skilled!

msg:The service is very good, the facilities are complete, and the staff are professional. It is comparable to the service of a foreign star hotel in the United States. Although the air conditioner is abnormal in the middle of the night, the hotel's remedial measures are satisfactory and worthy of praise. In addition, it is recommended that the hotel swimming pool opening time be extended a bit more

msg:The two days and one night spent at Qingyuan Qianli Hotel this weekend left a deep impression on me. The relaxing holiday style, fresh air, abundant entertainment facilities, leisure and fun, these two days are definitely rare in recent life. Happy time. What's more rare is that the excellent service from start to finish is definitely the key factor that attracted me to stay again. Before check-in, I specifically called to ask me if I have personal check-in preferences and help to decorate the room. WeChat at the front desk will answer my questions at any time during my stay, especially the manager Amy I met during check-out. Her kind care and efficient service gave me A perfect end was drawn to Qianli's two days.

msg:The parent-child facilities are superb, three indoors (baking, handcrafting, picture book reading, musical instrument playing, climbing, etc.), and an outdoor sports venue. Children‚Äôs balance bikes are free to ride. The hotel also arranges parent-child courses, both free and charged. Yes, the children don‚Äôt want to come back. Breakfast is very rich, lunch and dinner can be a la carte, buffet, the price is a bit expensive. The room is provided with hanging ear coffee, black tea, red wine, and refrigerator drinks, which is very pleasant. There are also some shortcomings: although the area of this room type is more than 100 square, it is actually part of the outdoor lawn, and the indoor space is not much different from the others. The lawn is not trimmed, and there are no special outdoor facilities (such as deck chairs, small tables, etc.). There is basically no desire to go up on rainy days. It is a bit tasteless. It is better to live on a higher floor and the landscape is better. The environment is a bit humid, snails are everywhere, and there are snail feces on the bathroom glass. I hope to strengthen the cleaning. It is recommended to add a drying rack.

msg:During the epidemic, breakfast was delivered to the room very intimately. But checkin did not have a waiter to send luggage to the room. A little bit of a fly in the oin**ent. However, it is understandable that there were fewer waiters during the epidemic. Other equipment and facilities are very good. In comparison of short-distance trips in the province, I think it is much better than Angsana in Zhuhai. All aspects of equipment are more complete. But the restaurant is not as good as Angsana

msg:The room was quite big, there was a big balcony bath and a photo, the refrigerator had Coke beer and apple juice for free, the child loved the apple juice, it felt really sweet.

Because it is summer did not go to the hot spring, went to the pool, the bruises are very good, 29 not expensive.

Also went to children's playground, archery golf ball on the table, etc. , play around the experience is very good, children are happy, adults are very relaxed.

Mainly now in the summer, I wish I had air conditioning indoors, so indoor playground and billiard ball is very good, there is air conditioning, with the baby free mother.

The US-China deficiency is the current outbreak period, the hotel can eat a few varieties.

Overall, highly recommended, five-star environment and service, a family for a weekend, good experience, also a film hahahahahahahaha
