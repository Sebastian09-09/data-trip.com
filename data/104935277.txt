Hygiene: Very dirty, cleaned it again by myself

Environment: Relatively remote

Service: Very poor, very slow to handle things, no one will handle it after several reminders, the toiletries I contacted the front desk at 5:50 have not been delivered after almost an hour, I called again, and it has been almost half an hour and still not delivered, I can't wait any longer, so I put it in the room when the front desk sent it before. The air conditioner works normally at night, but it can't cool down during the day. The main control setting has a problem and can't be used. The child is too hot, so I contacted them to deal with it, and they made excuses, but they didn't deal with it. There is no way, we can only check out.

Although the price is a little higher than usual, compared with those sky-high B&Bs, this one is very cost-effective. The playground next to it is also a pleasant surprise. The price is cheap, and you can play as you like for more than 20 yuan. The amusement facilities can be played by both big and small children. Highly recommended. I booked a parent-child room, and the children like it very much.

msg:The mood of three days and two nights was messed up by this hotel. I arrived in Shaoxing at noon on the 2nd. When I checked in, I asked the front desk whether there were children's toiletries in the room. I was told that there were. When I got to the room, I found that there were none. There was no toilet paper in the bathroom. I called the front desk and the conversation was (Hello, front desk, there is no toilet paper and children's toiletries in the room. I asked the aunt to send it to you. Goodbye), at this time I already felt that the attitude was not flattering. After about ten minutes, it was not delivered, so I called the front desk again. It was already past one o'clock at that time, and we hadn't eaten lunch yet. The attitude of the person answering the phone this time was still good. She said sorry to help urge. After hanging up the phone, I thought that this point should be cleaning time, so I opened the door to see if there was a cleaning lady outside. Who would have thought to hear such a paragraph (It's really annoying, I'm busy, you can't let her come to me to get it herself, she is opposite me), she came out from the room opposite me, saw me and said that she didn't have children's toiletries, I asked her if it was the hotel or she didn't have it, she said she didn't have it, and then brought me a roll of paper. At this point I was still restrained. I went out to play and arrived at the hotel at about ten o'clock in the evening. There were all kinds of hair and unknown black objects on the bedding and towels. Fortunately, I brought my own disposable four-piece sets and bath towels. There were all kinds of dust on the bedside, and it turned black when a tissue was lightly brushed over it. Attached are photos. I tidied the room myself the next morning. Before leaving the hotel, I repeatedly told the front desk that I didn't need housekeeping and asked the cleaning lady not to enter our room. The front desk called the cleaning lady in front of me. I returned to the hotel at around 9 o'clock in the evening, and found someone had entered the room when I opened the door. I was so angry that I called the front desk. The front desk said they would inform their manager, and then there was no more, until I checked out this morning. No one asked a single question from beginning to end. I repeatedly told them that there must be my reasons for not entering the room, but they turned a deaf ear to me. The sound insulation of the hotel is not very good. I can't understand why they arranged the tour group on the same floor as us individual guests. There was also a strange noise in the bathroom, which was not loud during the day but at night. My daughter was even scared when she went to the toilet at night. All kinds of things... This hotel makes me speechless, it's a mess!

Please be understanding and considerate if you think about the holidays! When I got the room at 16:00, I went in and saw that the family room only had one chair and no sofa. It’s also strange, and this design is also weird. Could it be that the person who booked the family room is not just bringing the whole family but living alone? Then I rushed to clean and found dirt on the sheets. After discovering the above problems, I immediately communicated with the hotel. The hotel responded quickly and changed the bed sheets and added two distinctive stools. It's really 5 stars.

It is difficult to understand when the mirror is facing the bed... The location of the hotel is actually quite remote, plus Many shops are closed during the Chinese New Year, and there are no restaurants or convenience stores within walking distance, which is not really convenient.
In addition to the room service operator, the hotel's waiters are also very enthusiastic.
We checked in on the second day of junior high school and called the room service to ask if they could send two more bottles of water. Interestingly, the young woman who answered the phone asked me, "Didn't you put water in your room?" If there is one in the room, additional water will be charged! Then the child needed a note and called room service again. She was still asked, "Isn't there a room?" This room service operator is really good at asking questions! Haha, so the two stars for this service are specially given to you!
After that, we ordered water by ourselves through takeout, and then... the boy delivered the water to the door of the room. I was wondering how he got it up...

msg:The hotel at the Asian Games venue is surprisingly good! The hotel's ground parking lot is large and spacious, and the underground parking lot is quite large! Parking is very friendly for newbies hahaha~ As soon as you enter the hotel, your eyes light up. The decoration style is very special, which is my favorite style! Check-in at the front desk was very fast. The staff were very friendly and courteous. There was also a concierge who handed out tea and helped with luggage. They were very considerate! The room has no smell, is new, clean and tidy, and the bathroom is very spacious! It’s no problem for two people to wash together! If you need items during your stay, the room attendant will deliver them very quickly. Let’s talk about the breakfast. It is a buffet breakfast with a wide variety. There is no problem in filling up! I just regret that I forgot to take pictures. Finally, let’s talk about the Asian Games venues, they are huge! There are various sports venues, including badminton halls, swimming pools, basketball halls, etc. The lights at night are very beautiful, so it is the first choice for walking! All in all, it was a very pleasant stay and I will definitely come back next time!

msg:I was very disappointed when I saw that I booked it at a five-star hotel for the Asian Games. The hygiene is very poor, the entire wall next to the bed is covered with thick dust from top to bottom; there are particularly obvious water stains on the faucet. Is such an obvious and large-scale hygiene problem invisible to so many employee groups and depar**ents, from cleaning to the store manager? The hotel's occupancy rate was not very high, so I didn't understand why I was given a room facing the road. I originally came for the gymnasium, but we were not given a room facing the gymnasium. There are no tissues or trash cans in the bathroom. When washing, I went back and forth to the room and toilet several times to pick up paper and throw away trash. Completely inconsistent with the movement line.

The hotel service is very good. We upgraded our room for free. We can see the baseball and softball stadium connected to the hotel and the game of the day. The hotel gave away a small gift for the Asian Games 🎁. The bedding was very comfortable and the breakfast was rich in variety. The stay was very comfortable. Next time I will choose Shaoxing Boutique Hotel Nanyuan.

msg:This is the hotel with the worst quality and front desk service I have ever stayed in. It also has a sign of BTG Nanyuan. I am absolutely speechless. I checked in at night and was assigned to the top floor. I heard a roar in the room around 10 o'clock and couldn't sleep. I asked the front desk if it was because of the air conditioning problem. Then the engineering depar**ent sent someone to check and said it was caused by the hot water equipment on the top floor or roof. , asked me to communicate with the front desk to change rooms. It turned out that the lady at the front desk was in a bad mood or something. She didn't have the skills to speak at least. She also questioned me and said that I was the only one to respond to this issue and needed to be confirmed by the manager on duty. I was speechless. This is the first time I encountered such a front desk. I don’t know how to rate this five-star hotel. As a hotel supporting the Asian Games venue, it is really ridiculous to have such service. I will never stay here again, and everyone should not live on the top floor.

Environment: It’s a bit far from the city center, so it’s quite quiet. Because Shaoxing is not big, it’s not far to go there

Disadvantages: The air conditioner in the room was too loud on the first day, and I didn't sleep well. The next day I went to the front desk to report the situation and changed the room. The next night, I still didn't sleep well, and the TV couldn't be turned off.

To go to the city center, such as Lu Xun’s hometown, it is recommended to take a bus to the subway station and transfer to the subway. It is also convenient. The hotel is a designated hotel for the Asian Games. The hardware facilities are definitely not to be chosen. The bedding is relatively comfortable. You can see the view of the baseball and softball stadium from the room. The breakfast is on the first floor, it is quite rich, there are hot dishes and so on to choose from. As a newly opened hotel, there is nothing to say about the hardware, but the software needs to be improved: for example, there are many staff members, but they don’t say hello when they see the guests. It's so small, I don't know why, I hope the engineering depar**ent can check it (deduct 0.5 points for these problems). After all, it is a new hotel, and the price/performance ratio is already very good. The cleaning lady on the 8th floor is also very warm-hearted, thank you very much. After leaving the store, a commissioner will pay a return visit. I hope the hotel will be better and better!

msg:酒店很新，所有的服務設備也很棒，喜歡自動化的門簾開拉方式（插卡自動拉開簾子，拔卡自動合簾）。更喜歡行政大床房的圓形浴缸，真的是疲憊一天的完美收官。
早餐種類滿豐富的，餐廳也很大，如果餐廳的燈光能夠更亮點就更好啦！
酒店的服務團隊都笑臉迎人，這種微笑服務讓人很舒心，早上因為自己帶的打印機沒墨還幫我打印紙張，服務很贊！
期待棒球賽的開啟！超近的賽場距離讓這家酒店成為觀賽首選！設施和服務也很加分，性價比蠻高！

msg:酒店四周一片繁忙的建設景象，周邊的配套設施都還沒有顯現，之所以選擇這家酒店主要是看中首旅品牌，但太讓人失望了:1.入住時體驗到了梯控，以為可以避免樓層人員雜的情況，看來是我自以為了。晚上點了外賣還好心的告訴前台一會麻煩機器人送一下（入住時在電梯廳遇到了機器人），結果是外賣小哥一手拿外賣一手拿房卡，把外賣送到房間門口敲門的。這梯控的意義何在？2.睡到半夜被莫名的刷卡提示聲吵醒，緊接着是一聲聲砸門聲，嚇的在房間裏不敢出聲，待砸門門結束後電話反饋給前台，5分鐘後回覆監控查了10分鐘，房間門口沒有人出現過，經一再追問回覆隔壁房間門口也沒人出現過，沒任何人員砸過門。作為一家五星級酒店，安全、誠信是最最基本的，酒店就這樣的處理方式，無法接受。難道是一起入住的兩人都“夢遊”不成，嚇得我們一晚都不敢睡，這樣的酒店不會再來第二次。

msg:酒店的地理位置還是很方便的高速出口10多分鐘就到了，雖然酒店外圍還沒有什麼商業，但是開車10多分鐘可以到達萬達廣場、柯橋古鎮、瓜渚湖公園等就餐還是很方便的。
酒店服務員的態度多很熱情，幫我們升級了行政雙床房，可以看到亞運會的壘球場。特別是小新小姐姐退房時送了我家小朋友一份禮物，禮輕意重也是一種服務的態度……
酒店的早餐品種豐富，食品的材料還是不錯的，特別水果多很新鮮，而且很甜。
酒店的環境整潔乾淨舒適，房間和衞生間也蠻大的。
這次入住酒店性價比超高👍👍👍家人們多比較滿意😀😀
（麗水返回上海的車程需要6小時左右，開車和座車的人比較累，所以選擇在紹興這個酒店休息一晚，調整一下在回上海。）

msg:去的時候離亞運會開幕還有四十幾天，酒店就能看到體育館看台。附近是棒球壘球場地，位置不錯，酒店也新，就是帶娃訂的雙床房，房間沒有那麼足夠大！前台很好，還幫我們安排了可看到體育館內景色的房。
紹興不大，自駕，酒店到柯橋景區也近，要經過紡織城。

msg:房間洗手間很臭。房間很熱，空調都不會涼。找了服務員過來説他們是中央空調，整個賓館房間都有一個開關來調節温度，房間不可以自行調節温度。後來拿給我們一個風扇。住房感受很差。
