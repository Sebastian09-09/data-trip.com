Special thanks to Mr. Oliver from the executive lounge for providing information beforehand on the activities the hotel offer, suggestions in planning the stay. The hotel management is well coordinated but the Healing touch( the spa which is a separate building) isn‚Äôt very coordinated. Although we pre-booked one activity, after we arrived they weren‚Äôt ready and we only could do it after half and hour, so we missed the next activity as planned in the schedule. The breakfast is as per standard hotel. The staff provided a health card in the room to note blood pressure, it was supposed to be checked by the staff at breakfast to provide special diet recommendations. There wasn‚Äôt anyone at breakfast for consultation. 
Overall the experience was fun with special teas, herbal bath and various sessions. But with all the crowd and wedding parties, it didn‚Äôt feel a quiet spa resort.

Lovely detail having the butler settle you in & explain all the features (limited English but she did her best). 
We enjoyed the provided teas & joined the meditation workshop (provided for free). Our teacher Was very knowledgeable and it was an informative session. Would suggest to have a no phone rule for these sessions many guests brought their phones in and took calls during the mediation which was distracting. Buffet breakfast was amazing - such a great variety of western & Chinese

I would advise against booking during a major holiday; it's not the optimal time for solo travelers/couples who are looking for a peaceful hotel stay due to the large number of guests with small children running around. With that being said, the Anandi is a fine hotel that ticks all the boxes for a fabulous staycation or getaway.

According to different healing themes, a thermos cup with corresponding tea soup will be delivered to the room, and you can refill it within two days. The good night soup in the evening is very delicious. If you need morning tea in the morning, you can fill out a form and hang it on the door. You can find the form behind the door. You can choose your own pillow. The bed is a bit soft, but it doesn't hurt your back after a night's sleep. Breakfast was very rich and delicious!
The hotel's various courses are very consistent with the healing theme, the reservation function is very complete, and the operation is simple and well managed. When Cici helped me check in, she was worried that there would be too many guests to book my favorite class, so she took the initiative to add me on WeChat and sent me the class schedule and reservation QR code.
From the moment I walked into the hotel, I always felt that the waiters were very proactive and thoughtful. Every area has such a sense of experience. I always feel that I am being cared for. This is valuable on the first day of the May Day holiday when the hotel is very busy. It shows that Hotel management and training are in place.
Thanks to Ctrip for providing such a great room coupon, and thanks for meeting me in Anadi. No picture can capture my happiness and satisfaction.

The first time I experienced sound therapy, I fell asleep directly~ The yoga and deep sleep of the Indian teacher and the morning breathing yoga are all very good!
There is a hot spring in the package, and there is also a bathtub in the room, so I took a bath for two days and my body was very relaxed.
Breakfast is a buffet in the Western restaurant, which is very rich and has more styles than a number of five-star hotels. I ate Japanese food for lunch, a Spanish restaurant for dinner, and a midnight snack when I returned to the room. The sense of happiness was overwhelming.

Then I waited until I got to the lobby, and the girl said it was in the building where the spa was done. I went there, but the front desk said it was wrong and it was in the main building. I was a little unhappy at this moment, and then I asked the colleague who made the reservation and the gsm, and they answered that the package information I booked could not see the updated version! Now they have updated the information synchronously! I immediately opened the Ctrip screen recording and sent it to her, and the colleague who made the reservation replied, ‚ÄúAh? What a ridiculous attitude!‚Äù

I asked the gsm again, and they asked me back, ‚ÄúIs it true? They have updated it, but I can‚Äôt see the updated version!‚Äù Do you treat guests as **?

Should you verify the situation before resolving customer complaints? Two points of praise are given to the housekeeper and the big brother of the foot bath depar**ent, who are much more enthusiastic and professional than the so-called gsm and housekeeper!

It's not the first time I stay here, but the experience gets worse and worse. The standard of breakfast has also obviously dropped. The fat chef in black clothes who makes omelettes looks nonchalant, and the male chef at the noodle stall is also extremely indifferent!

In terms of hardware, decorative paintings may add some artistic atmosphere, but in a small room, too many decorative paintings have the opposite effect on the sense of crowding. The problem of the unstable breakfast table has affected my stay experience. It feels like a bumpy meal on a cruise ship~
As for software, Anadi's "butler" service is a complete deduction. The fast speaking speed and lack of patience made me feel like I was being rushed. This service method is obviously not considerate enough. When I need to make an appointment or seek help, it is difficult to contact the butler, which undoubtedly adds to my troubles and inconvenience.

When the gap between the expectations and the reality widens, I cannot help but feel a sense of disappointment. 
While decorative paintings might enhance the artistic ambiance in terms of hardware, in this cramped hotel room, they unfortunately contribute to a feeling of overcrowding. Additionally, the unstable breakfast table has significantly marred my stay, reminiscent of a bumpy meal on a cruise ship. 
Regarding the software aspect, Anandi's "butler" service falls short of expectations. The rapid speech and lack of patience leave me feeling hurried, lacking the warmth and attention I had anticipated. Moreover, when I attempt to make appointments or seek assistance, reaching the butler becomes a challenge, adding unnecessary inconvenience and frustration. It would have been simpler if I had been directed to the front desk instead. 
As a result, I have cancelled the remaining two packages of my stay at Anandi.

The main focus is sleep. When checking in, the pressure value was measured, but everyone actually had the same value. . It's just a formality, and it also increases the check-in time.
However, I have to say that the overall hardware of the hotel is still very good, fragrant, and the waiters are all smiling

The staff was still online, which was very worthy of recognition. Especially the CC in the executive lounge, because we also brought the elderly at home, and saw that we had been waiting for a long time, he arranged a room for us to rest first, and then changed to another room after our room was cleaned. It is worth a thumbs upüëç However, as a Marriott Titanium member, I have been to more than 100 different lounges in a year, but I was still refreshed by the scene of the Anadi Executive Lounge this timeüòÖ Basically, the dishes were sold out in seconds, and some people even ate while standing. I also saw people taking food from other people's bowls directly... The elderly in our family went there during happy hour, and only ate 2 spring rolls, saying that there was nothing left... I hope the hotel will consider not opening up the benefits to so many people, or limiting the flow, otherwise the experience is really too bad, and it is not an exaggeration to say that it is "eye-opening", which is too inconsistent with the temperament of Anadi! ü§£

This stay happened to be my mother-in-law's 70th birthday. The room was decorated, and the Chinese restaurant gave us birthday noodles and birthday cakes. It was very pleasant! I also used the 600 yuan coupon in the Ctrip package to experience the Spanish restaurant. It was great!

I also experienced energy therapy by chance. Because I went there without an appoin**ent, the guests in this time period cancelled their trips. Although I couldn't see or touch the resonance, I felt very healed after sleeping. Special thanks to Amy for her explanation. She said that my energy field was very rare, and she also gave me a small gift~

In general, the 3-day and 2-night itinerary was fully arranged. Every staff member made this experience a plus. The hotel management is very good. It is a rare service group online among all the hotels I have stayed in. It is definitely one of the best in the world! The only suggestion is to really improve the experience of your executive loungeü§≠ü§≠

Advantages: The hotel has a rich variety of workshop courses, including yoga for mothers, pottery and parent-child dance for children, and various health courses for sound therapy suitable for everyone ~ and the finale program, hot springs. Disadvantages: Hot springs are calculated by time (you can't come back after leaving, and you need to buy another ticket). It is not friendly enough for customers who need to participate in courses outside the hot springs and want to come back to continue soaking in the hot springs; it is not a heated toilet seat; the hotel's own mini program price is actually more favorable than Ctrip. I feel that I have lost a huge amount of money when booking a room on Ctrip. In general, everyone had a great time and should come again.

msg:The hotel is located in a not very prosperous area, and its uniqueness is all due to its characteristics. The hotel style is somewhat Thai, Zen, quiet, and focuses on environmental protection. Different colored thermos cups contain fruit teas suitable for different physiques, from welcome tea to wake-up tea, which are both delicious and environmentally friendly, and always keep the temperature. Put on the hotel's characteristic work clothes and cotton and linen slippers, walk slowly in various places, restaurants, hot springs, and spas, and relax naturally. The experience projects included in the package are basically OK. The room has a good view. Sitting on the balcony, accompanied by warm lights and breezes, it is very comfortable... The bedding that comes with the room is also good, and I also experienced the tea fragrance and lavender pillow. The service is basically OK. Some staff are particularly professional and enthusiastic, such as Xiao Ke, a boy in the buffet restaurant, and Aunt Han, a hot spring waiter, who are all proactive and skilled in providing services to customers. Although they are all repetitive work, they can still feel sincere and patient. The overall catering is not particularly amazing, but the steamed pot oysters for dinner, the freshly wrapped wontons and handmade oa**eal yogurt for breakfast are all good. In addition, the toiletries for this room price should at least be of branded essential oil grade, but they are completely unknown chemical products, and not even as good as those used in public areas such as the hot springs, which is not in line with the quality and concept pursued by the hotel as a whole. The coffee in the hot spring rest area is good.

msg:The hotel has a health theme. As soon as you enter the lobby, you can smell lemon-scented aromatherapy essential oil. The service and hardware facilities are great. There was a stress test and welcome tea when you checked in. There was a foreign lady who spoke very good Chinese. The room is fully equipped, the toiletries are from the Spanish royal brand Yuebish, and the citrus scent is very pleasant.
There are peacocks in the hotel, three males and three females. The aunt who raises the peacocks is warm and friendly. She introduced us and asked her for insect feed to feed the peacocks.
There are various health courses in the hotel where you stay. You can scan the QR code and choose to make an appoin**ent. There are yoga, breathing and wellness courses, etc., taught by an Indian uncle who speaks very good Chinese. There is also a German physiotherapy device to try, next to the bakery on the first floor, it is recommended to try it, the young lady who serves it is warm and beautiful.
There is a very good bakery on the first floor with a full range of varieties and good taste.
Breakfast is also on the first floor and ends at 10:30. It has many varieties and tastes good. The pineapple inside is very delicious. Cup cakes, chocolate brownies, and ravioli are also recommended. The fried dumplings are average, but the fried dumplings are good.
There is also a hot spring pavilion in a house next to the hotel. The LG1 floor is connected to the hotel. It is strongly recommended that customers here try to buy this project. The hot springs, saunas and fruit snacks are all great. It is open until 00:00 in the morning. Because there are not many places to walk around the hotel, the hot spring pavilion is a good leisure place, as well as a chess and card room, sleeping room, restaurant, children's playground, etc.
Please note that check-out of this hotel is at 12:00 the next day, and you cannot extend your stay until 14:00 for free. The breakfast on the first floor is great. The Yue Chinese Restaurant on the second floor feels that it is not cost-effective, the taste is average, and the price is not low.

msg:On April 28, the company chose to have a dinner party in the buffet restaurant of this hotel. After the dinner, I checked in alone, thinking that I would stay for one night and drive home at noon the next day when there were fewer cars on the road. It was just right to relax in this health hotel. I spent more than 2,000 yuan a night in exchange for a pack of gas.
Because I often stay in hotels alone, I often go to buffet restaurants to eat alone, but this is the first time I have encountered this situation, which really pissed me off! First of all, the usher did not give me a card for dining alone when he took me to sit down, which is OK, because there are also many waiters in restaurants who are really good at seeing. However, in this restaurant, when I was halfway through eating and left to get the meal, a male waiter quickly took away all the food and tableware that I had not finished. I took a plate of food and a drink back to my seat, and found that everything was taken away, so I went to tell him that I had not finished eating yet. I thought he would say sorry and then replenish the tableware for me, but the result was high energy!
His first sentence was: "You should leave your phone on the table when you leave!"
I was shocked. I said I left my phone on the table? What if my phone was taken by someone?
He said, "Impossible! We have surveillance cameras everywhere, who would take your phone?"... I felt embarrassed to talk to him, so I didn't want to talk to him anymore, and turned around and left. He continued to say behind me, "Who took your phone? This is called theft!"
Because I ordered a bowl of wontons, I went to get the wontons and returned to the table. He still didn't replenish my tableware. Good guy, this doesn't want me to continue eating. I can only find another waitress in another area to help me replenish my tableware.
The whole process shocked me! I lost my appetite! Is this hotel too unfriendly to guests staying alone? ! I came to eat alone, and halfway through the meal, the food was taken away, and you blame me?
What a joke, I don't know if this behavior is considered theft? I want him to educate me about the law? But the problem is, if there is a chance that someone takes my phone away, how much trouble will it cause me? At that time, your hotel will have to cooperate with the police to investigate and adjust the surveillance, and may have to compensate for the loss. Don't you think it's troublesome? ? If your hotel supports customers leaving their phones on the table when they leave, then this point can help you promote it vigorously.
Adhering to the principle of not wasting food, I quickly finished the meal I took and left this extremely infuriating restaurant. I went to their restaurant manager to report the situation, complained, and got two 3 ml essential oil samples as compensation...
This incident will not make people think that it is a personal problem of the waiter, but only that it is a problem of the overall management of the hotel, the training is not up to standard, the assessment is not up to standard, and the overall contempt for customers.
Very disappointed, the software of this hotel is not worthy of this price. I originally wanted to recommend friends who came from other places to stay in this hotel close to Hongqiao during the May Day holiday, but now they are not considered at all, I am so angry!

We originally planned to bring our baby, but later we had something to do and came to relax in our own world. The hotel simply decorated the anniversary decoration. The service training of Anadi Hotel is still very good. I have stayed in so many Starwood and Hyatt hotels, and I am also a platinum member. Sometimes the service is not as good as this hotel. Every waiter I met in Anadi is very warm and friendly. There are also many activities. The Indian teacher who is very good at Chinese is so cute. I like it very much. In addition, the dishes in the Chinese restaurant are also very good and satisfying. The hot spring is not very big, there are not many pools, the environment is very clean and sanitary, there are also pools for children to play, the hot spring rest area is quite large, and the variety of drinks and fruits is OK. I will bring my baby and friends to experience it again next time. There is not much food to eat during the dinner time in the executive lounge, only a little snack. If there is a little regret, it is that the power outage occurred when using the hair dryer...but the maintenance staff came quickly. Overall, I am very satisfied, recommended, and will come again next time!

Service: There is a sense of service, and the staff are also polite and enthusiastic, but the management level needs to be improved.
Disadvantages: 1. When checking in, the staff asked two adults to go with him for a physical test, saying that the children should wait alone in the lobby, but no corresponding personnel were arranged to take care of the children, which should not be done from a safety perspective; 2. The management of the Spanish restaurant is a bit messy, and the wrong dishes are frequently delivered; 3. The lobby bar did not take the initiative to help deliver drinks to the location; 4. They asked to measure blood pressure, and said that the blood pressure situation should be shown to the staff at breakfast, but the staff did not recommend any meals after seeing it.

msg:I took my sister on a two-day and one-night trip to Anadi. Thank you to the housekeeper, Ms. Xue Jin! Super gentle, attentive and considerate~ This time I felt full of sense of ritual when I checked in. I unexpectedly found that the cakes sold in the hotel bakery were delicious. All the staff I met this time were very nice. The hot spring was very comfortable and the Chinese medicine bath bag in the room was very good. Easy to use! An evening bedtime ritual is also great. Will visit again!

msg:I have long heard that Anadi‚Äôs stress-relieving and healing effects are good, and I have been to many hot spring hotels before. A good hotel will definitely bring us healing effects, but I didn‚Äôt expect that this stress-relieving trip was even more perfect than expected. Must give RIK Zhang a thumbs upüëç
After arriving at the front desk, there are considerate refreshments, property and stress tests, and tea will be delivered according to the different properties of Feng, Fire and Water. The thermos cup works great too!
The butler greeted us at the elevator door. After arriving in the room, we were given a detailed room tour, as well as welcome refreshments. I especially like the chocolate truffles~ The stress test also correctly reflected that I have sleep problems. Each room is equipped with a saffron sleep aid bath bag. There is a wide range of pillows to choose from, and the butler let us experience the selection one by one. Then it‚Äôs time to patiently introduce the course of the workshop.
I really like the wrapping of the mattress and quilt. It feels like your whole body sinks into the bed. The full sense of security makes people feel relaxed. Later, the aunt will help turn on the aromatherapy and sleep-aiding music, and also bring salads with matching properties.
I made a reservation for a meditation class in the evening. The teacher's guidance voice was very powerful, and the entire magnetic field and a**osphere were warm and powerful. Just thirty minutes of meditationüßòmakes you sober!
I arrived just when the hot spring restaurant was about to take a break. I finished my quick dip. I completely misunderstood it at the time, thinking that the hot springs could be enjoyed the next day, and I missed the thermal trea**ent room and rest area. This can be written more clearly on Ctrip. You can only enjoy it once during your stay‚Äº Ô∏èYou also need to be reminded when checking in‚Äº Ô∏è
The whole hotel stay was enjoyable and relaxing, and we shared our minor disappoin**ents and suggestions with RIK Zhang when we checked out. After listening patiently, RIK proactively offered to help replenish the hot spring. It simply took this hotel experience to a new level! Due to work, he worked overtime in the lobby, making RIK wait for a long time, and brought us to Tangquan before he was about to get off work. Thank you RIK for your care, patience and high professionalism! Make Anadi the first choice healing hotel in Shanghai!

msg:I have heard about this health hotel for a long time. This time I brought my whole family to experience it and opened 2 rooms on Chris**as Eve, so there were a lot of activities and food! There is a physical examination when you check in. I personally think it is very accurate! There are also snacks and ringing bells for relaxation!
The room is very spacious and has a small balcony. It faces the swimming pool and the opposite restaurant. Especially on Chris**as Eve, you can hear the singing of the opposite, which makes you feel like you are abroad.
Then there will be a housekeeper in that room who will greet us at the elevator entrance. Miss Amy is super cute. After taking us to the room, she then very carefully introduces me to my report and my family's, and introduces what activities are available in the hot springs and hot springs below. Lots of yoga classes.
Everyone must remember to bring a swimsuit and hat when bathing in the hot spring, otherwise you will have to buy one. After soaking in the hot spring, you can go up to the steam room, which I personally think is a great way to remove moisture! Then there are a variety of drinks and fruits, including strawberries and cherries. Children also like it very much. It is open and open until 1130 in the evening. Then back to the room, the room service will bring you a small salad and biscuits in the evening, which are very healthy. The room will help you light up the aromatherapy. Most of the small bars are free, and the bathroom used is Naussie, which seems to be a Swiss brand. Not bad, and then the room was a surprise, with rice wine and chocolates, and an aromatherapy bracelet. It was really a lot of surprises!
Pajamas and yoga practice clothes are all prepared, and it feels like staying here for one day is not enough! Children can also play surfing in Tang Hot Spring, which is quite good! There is also health-preserving tea for drinking in the evening, and ginger tea in the morning. Mom and Dad like it very much!
Breakfast is also very good! Very interesting five-star hotel highly recommended!

There are a few things I hope will lead to a better experience in the future:
1. Can the sound insulation of the workshop experience be improved? During meditation or sound therapy, the shouts of children outside the door directly destroy the effect.
2. The workshop clothing provided is very unfriendly to short and fat people. The waist is tight but the trousers are already very long. Can special sizes be provided?
3. The maternal deep sleep provided this time has been reserved. I was unable to experience it because the teacher was busy, which is a pity.

The room and bathroom we stayed in were very clean, and there was a spare roll of roll paper, which was very user-friendly. However, the paper towels were only available at the sink and not in the room. It was a bit inconvenient. It is recommended to improve.
The bedding is also very comfortable, and there are many kinds of pillows to choose from, which is also a good experience.
After check-in, you will be provided with tea suitable for your physique based on the questionnaire at the front desk. There will also be healthy meals and snacks in the evening. Morning tea will be left at the door in the morning (you can choose the time and method of provision).
There are different courses that can be booked and experienced every day. What was originally intended to be a lying-down retreat has turned into a meaningful experiential retreat, which is quite an alternative stay experience.
Oh, they also have hot springs where you can take a bath, which is good to come in winter.
Overall, I feel good. I would like to stay at this hotel again.

msg:This is the fourth time I've stayed here. It's mainly close to home. I probably won't come back again in the future. The environment is five-star, but the service really can't keep up. Good service is reflected in the little things, not too many gimmicks. Before checking in, I had received two phone calls from the hotel asking about this and that. It turned out that the slippers in the room were for two left feet, and there were no toiletries or slippers and pajamas for the children. The executive lounge is the smallest one I have seen now. When the time comes, it is crowded with people, everyone is holding plates and grabbing seats. Is this an executive lounge in a five-star hotel? ! Later in the evening we didn't even go to waste the benefits. The hot spring area was crowded and noisy. The housekeeper added me on WeChat and asked me about it. There was no reply for a long time. He made a voice call and said he was in a meeting (it was 10 o'clock in the morning). I called the room phone for service and no one answered for half an hour. There was a long queue for the salmon section in the buffet restaurant. The chef was stingy as always and only gave me a few slices. I didn‚Äôt understand why he couldn‚Äôt just take it as it was not a precious food. The middle-level leaders came politely, but basic employee services simply couldn't keep up. If the boss is Indian, then this level of management would be understandable.

msg:This stay was perfect, worthy of Anadiüëçüèª



Hygiene: I have no choice. The bathing area is very clean, and the pool is also very clean. Auntie is very quick and cleans up any water stains quickly, ensuring that the ground is fresh. I just had the surgery not long ago and I am afraid to go there. I may fall down and slip when I take a bath in the hot spring. This time I feel relieved. As for the cleanliness of the room, the only drawback is that the bathtub will be dusty. This is understandable. Most hotels have hot spring service, so you may not use it much. It is recommended that you use it when you return to the room. If you have a bathtub, you can ask the hotel if it has a bathtub cover.

Environment: The design is very high-end, especially the spiral staircase. It is very good for girls. You can take pictures everywhere. The hotel seems to be filled with lemon scent? Personally, it's average but acceptable. There is a peacock in the hotel. What surprised me is that there is no smell at all. This is a good review!

Facilities: I would like to call Tangquan the ceiling of Shanghai Tangquan. While I was still exploring inside, my aunt had already prepared cotton disposable underwear and clothes from the workshop. Even their equipment was from the top brands, including Dyson. The hair dryer and comb, facial cleanser and toner are all from Lanc√¥me. They are also equipped with Est√©e Lauder essence and Bioderma makeup remover. They even provide contact lens care solution and boxes for the ladies. They have services that I didn‚Äôt expect! I really admire their carefulness

Service: The butler who received me this time was Albert Li Youbo. He thoughtfully upgraded us to an executive room in advance before we even arrived at the hotel, and later provided us with a late check-outüëçüèª
The ladies at the administrative reception on the 10th floor were very patient during the whole process. They exempted us from paying the deposit because our bank had a limit, which eased our embarrassmentü•π Afterwards, they prepared tea for us according to our physical constitution. Tiffany also specially prepared tea for us when sending us into the elevator. We were reminded of the time of our lounge benefits, and all the service staff we met during our stay at the hotel were very friendly and greeted us with their special gestures. My husband and I also studied whether this gesture is different between men and women. Ha ha ha ha 

The summary of this experience is: I will come again in the future! And come when you have time!

We booked a balcony pool room and were taken directly to the executive floor on the 10th floor to check in. Afternoon tea is also available directly on the 10th floor. The room is fully prepared and the quality of the supplies is also in place. Points were deducted for the facilities because the restaurant on the first floor is a little smaller.

Room facilities:
It's much newer than what's shown in the photos. The room has incense, healing music and pillows of your own choice to help you fall asleep. New Zealand mineral water, bedtime rice wine, chocolate, nuts, small bottles of beer and soft drinks are also available. Tea or snacks were also delivered twice.
breakfast:
It's very rich, and the most special thing is that the coffee comes with latte art, which is surprising. The environment outside the floor-to-ceiling windows on the first floor is also quite amazing [Victory]
Executive Lounge:
On the 10th floor, check in at the door. When you enter, you will find the executive lounge with a superb balcony view. The cocktails are very delicious. It is so relaxing to have a drink while enjoying the view as night falls.
Value for money:
The price of less than 2,300 yuan is worth the money, because staying in this hotel will be extremely fulfilling, and you need to make a reservation plan before taking a bath and taking various courses. The officials and service staff were all very polite, but the Indian male teacher had a dark face the whole time and was not very focused during the half-hour lessons. Maybe it was because of the language barrier!

msg:I have known Anadi for a long time, and this time I wanted to take my husband‚Äôs birthday to take him to experience Anadi‚Äôs healing journey. The overall experience was pretty good. What I want to praise most is the service provided by the healing butler Xue Jin and the lounge manager Cici! There were various minor snags in the middle, but they were all sorted out by two caring ladies! ! The dinner reservation was delayed until the last minute, but cici helped arrange the best dining time for Anadi, which is very popular on Saturday. Moreover, when we communicated at that time, it was already past 11.12 pm, and she also thoughtfully arranged a small birthday cake. ü•πSo gratefulü•π

We checked in very late, and Xue Jin also gave us a lot of thoughtful suggestions, which finally allowed us to experience all the aspects we wanted to experience smoothly ~ (except for the explanation course of vein energy... which is really the one I am most interested in) I can only save it for next timeüòø
„ÄêBless the two snail girls to become rich women soon~üí∞üí∞üí∞üòò

üÜòThe thing to be careful of here is that when I called to communicate with the customer service on the first day, I thought that all activities would be held in my room, but all courses require reservations in advance, so be sure to check in as early as possible! This will ensure that you can experience all the courses you are interested in as much as possible

The hot spring experience is not as good as expected. There are 5 large pools with different water temperatures and depths. They look like ordinary swimming pools. It is not the feeling of bathing in the hot springs as expected, but the water temperature and depth are very comfortable! (Getting along with all the service staff at Anadi is as comfortable as the water temperature here! üòåAfter taking a bath, the aunt took the initiative to ask if she wanted water to take off her clothes. After finishing, she thoughtfully put it in a paper bag, so that it would be OK Separate it from your bag

The experience of the dining environment is slightly worse. Although it is indoors, there is always a cool breeze and it is a bit cold. The food became cold soon after it was plated. However, the hot desserts provided at the buffet dinner are super delicious. Thank you very much. Small cakes prepared for us by the restaurant! ~(People who are picky about cakes also find hin delicious!

And the executive lounge has a rich menu, the ladies are also very humble and courteous, and the service is very attentive~

Smoothly mention that Anadi's contact details are quite good. When I turned down at night, I even placed an electronic blood pressure monitorü§£The data will be used as a recommended reference for breakfast the next day (unfortunately, I was left out to experience it again) ü•≤

The last demo demo! ! The hotel's birthday decoration is too devoid of a birthday a**osphere. It's hard to tell that it has anything to do with the birthday. When serving the cake, it's just the act of serving the cake, so if you want a more ceremonial birthday celebration, Anadi Not a particularly good choice~

As a service design practitioner, looking at the theme of "balanced joy" in hotels, there are still many areas that need to be improved, and there are many experiences that are disconnected from the theme. But as an ordinary consumer, a humane and flexible service is the best experience~~ (Confess again to the lounge manager cici

[Location] No. 7 Linhong Road. It is recommended to drive or take a taxi. It takes 10-15 minutes to walk to the nearby bus station and subway station.
[Service] Very good. Thank you Iris for contacting us in advance and taking the trouble to help us confirm our room requirements, parking information, children's needs, and package contents. When we checked in, they prepared health tea for us and welcomed us at the subway entrance. We were introduced to the room and various courses. I couldn't make reservations for some courses and even tutored me. Thank you!
„Äêfeature„Äë
1. Their workshop courses are all good, including not only sound therapy, yoga, deep sleep, etc. for adults, but also pottery and bilingual yoga for children.
2. The breakfast is also very good and rich.
3. Hengyue Hot Spring is also good. There are not many hot spring pools. There are three indoor and two outdoor ones, but it has special paddle board yoga. There is also a sauna room on the first floor. It also has abundant fruit drinks, all of which are included in the hot spring ticket. If you want to eat What else can be ordered a la carte. The Spanish paella in our set menu is full of ingredients, including cod, prawns, mussels, scallops, and squid!
It happened to be the Mid-Autumn Festival and the hotel also sent moon cakes, prepared a party, and sparkling wine. They were so thoughtful.
This time the schedule was too full so I stayed here. I will come back to experience it next time!

This hotel is suitable for children and the elderly to stay healthy. Children have so much fun in the hot springs that they don‚Äôt want to come out. There is no need to worry about the hot springs being 38-41 degrees Celsius, so they are not afraid of the cold. Dad eats and sleeps well in the hotel, and the surrounding environment is beautiful and quiet. Dad, who usually dares not go out for a walk, comes out to look at the courtyard, sit on the sofa outside, bask in the sun and drink coffee. It is so enjoyable!

There was no working staff to remind us to do it the next day. If we hadn't been here before and knew that there was such a process, it included tests, bracelets, tea, etc. You can't enjoy a series of services that you should have when staying in a hotel. In addition, a dinner included in the package, Yamano Sakura, I had made a reservation with the front desk for the next night before checking in. When I arrived, the restaurant said that it could not be used. Not only that, both the front desk and the restaurant were evasive, and the phone calls were exchanged, and there was no work. The staff solved the problem. On the phone, they said the meal was in the lobby on the first floor. When they arrived on the first floor, they said it was on the second floor. The bellman did not write down the room number after taking the luggage, and asked the guests to go to the lobby to find it from the car. It was really exaggerated. The whole thing was very chaotic, and there was no one to hand over the work. The whole review was negative.

The hot spring provided is very comfortable. The first floor is for bathing. There are only about 6 pools with a depth of 90cm. It is just right for children to play. The children had a lot of fun. There is a rest area on the first floor where drinks and fruits can be eaten. This is great. alright. Not worth the extra cost for admission.

When you get out of the elevator on the room floor, you will be greeted by a friendly butler who can give you advice based on the physical test and help arrange subsequent courses. The hotel's supporting Hengyue Xinshe has a comfortable environment, cleanliness and considerate service. The hot spring is divided into two parts: indoor and outdoor. There are paddleboard yoga classes indoors, and soaking outdoors at night will give you a different feeling. In fact, the most surprising thing is the hotel's service. Every employee you meet will say hello cordially and often remind you to pay attention to the steps under your feet. When leaving the hotel by car, the doorman would wave goodbye, which shows that the hotel has put great effort into training and managing its employees. Looking forward to our next encounter.

msg:This time I stayed for one night. It was a bit far from the city. The hotel looked more like an office building and the lighting was not very good. But the service in the hotel is good, really at the level of Haidilao. I would like to thank Bailey who helped check in, Una who greeted us, and especially Cici who helped pass cookies to the noisy daughter during check-in and played with her. After I left the hotel, I still asked how the experience was. . (The service staff here are very good-looking).

The room is big enough and the bath is very comfortable. Chinese herbal medicine bags will be prepared. There is mini salad in the evening, and ginger tea is given in the morning. The mini bar is full of sincerity. The breakfast variety is very rich and the taste is great.

Having said that, please let me talk about the areas for improvement. First of all, Tangquan is just a few small swimming pools [laughing and crying], and the service aunt in Tangquan has a very good attitude. However, the paella provided in the set meal must be used at the same time as the hot spring. Although the service of the reception staff is good, they are not very flexible and a bit dogmatic. When ordering food upstairs in Tangquan, you must also go to the reception desk of Tangquan downstairs to pay... Customers are running up and down, and the experience is very average. In addition, the food and drinks upstairs in Tangquan are not very good. The waiter will ignore the guest's request (probably because he cannot remember it), and then directly give the waiter a clue to greet him. I asked for a baby chair. I asked three or four times and asked three waiters before the chair came. It was very crowded and stuffy, with tables and chairs next to each other. btw, from the guest room to the hot spring, you have to go down the stairs and go through a long corridor, and there were three weddings in the middle... It was very hard.

Overall, hotel management can be more optimized. I also feel that some of the hotel's standards have become a burden for some service staff. How to guide employees to understand the hotel's values ‚Äã‚Äãand be proud of the hotel's values ‚Äã‚Äãmay be something the hotel can consider. I am still very grateful to those individuals. In addition to the above-mentioned people, I am also grateful to the aunt who delivered the salad. She was very meticulous in her work, as well as the management staff who went to the 11th floor and met in the elevator. She chatted with the guests very politely and parked the car. The waiter I met on the spot went back to open the door for me.

msg:A great and special experience

The butler Chloe is very considerate and will contact you one day in advance to understand our check-in needs and preparations before check-in. I was very surprised to arrange a room upgrade that day! Surprised and thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è
I don't know the principle of the physical fitness test, but it can accurately prompt the condition of the corresponding parts of the body. Health-preserving teas according to different physiques are placed in thermos cups, which are warm and delicious.
From check-in to check-out, you can experience various courses in the hotel without stopping. Because the housekeeper reminded me how to make a reservation for the course, I planned the time reasonably and experienced a lot of courses smoothly. Among them, the paddle board class is a major feature, and the fun of paddling in summer is endless. I was also fortunate to participate in the Tai Chi class in the morning on weekends. The teacher patiently explained the movements and came to guide and correct the movements individually. After an hour of Tai Chi class, my body is slightly sweaty, which is very comfortable.
Besides, the facilities in the room are clean and tidy, and the whole person is very relaxed with the faint aroma of essential oils. The large bathing pool can be enjoyed slowly, and the hotel also provides a traditional Chinese medicine bag for bathing to soothe the body and mind before falling asleep.
The dishes in the hotel's executive lounge and afternoon tea are exquisite and taste great, especially the dessert cakes. The landscape outside the lounge is also quite open.
The breakfast is rich in variety and tastes pretty good. There are also pan-fried buns, surprise! Fruit and vegetable juices for different physiques are so delicious! Can't help but try every flavor!
Anadi is indeed a relaxing and healing option, suitable for bringing the family to experience. I will come again if I have a chanceüòò

msg:The price of the pre-sale package is not bad. After reading the comments, I have been planted grass. Taking advantage of the heavy work pressure during this period, I can just relax. Arrived at the hotel after 3 o'clock, there were quite a lot of people checking in, so I waited for some time; after measuring the pressure index and physical fitness, I went back to the room to rest and start a fulfilling 20h hotel tour. After attending the singing bowl healing class, sleep class, Tai Chi in the morning, soaking in hot springs, steaming heat therapy, the swimming pool on the top floor did not have time to enter the water; I have to mention that the facilities of Hengyue Xinshe are still very complete. There are also quite a variety of fruits and drinks, but the dining experience needs to be improved, the process is a bit confusing, and the appoin**ent is not very useful, and it takes a long time. However, the experience of the whole hotel is still great, and I will definitely come again if I have a chance in the future

msg:I visited Anadi four times in half a year. This time I chose to stay at the weekend with my relatives and several family members. The beautiful lady Sweety Wu, the exclusive healing butler, has always provided excellent service. She made room reservations and arrangements for us in advance, and thoughtfully upgraded the room type for free. The exclusive Hengyue room felt spacious and comfortable after staying in it. Although it coincides with the heavy passenger flow on the weekend and it is said that all the rooms are full, the hotel is responding in an orderly manner and the service quality is still online. Although Ms. Wu was off on the weekends, she took the trouble to help contact and solve any of our needs immediately. The relatives were also very satisfied with their stay. I sincerely thank her for her "Haidilao"-style service and care that considers the guests in everything. ! There are many unnamed hotel staff at the hotel front desk, luggage porters, Western restaurants, Hengyue Hot Spring Pavilion, Executive Lounge and the guest room depar**ent on the 7th floor. Every one of them is very kind and friendly to our guests, and the service is considerate and thoughtful. , which deeply moved our group. The itinerary is full of eating, drinking and entertainment. You can‚Äôt go out of Shanghai for a flat-bed vacation. I recommend this place with five stars. After experiencing many five-star hotels in other places and in the city, Anadi is the most suitable, and I love it the most! I look forward to launching more cost-effective packages in the future so that I can have the opportunity to experience it multiple times!

The spare part is nb sweet orange flavor, I like this taste very much, the room has prepared truffle chocolate almonds and rice wine, as well as health tea according to the physical fitness test, evening detox salad and biscuits corresponding to the physical fitness, there are white noise speakers and Himalayan salt lamps by the bedside At night, you can use the bath salts and traditional Chinese medicine packs prepared by the hotel to take a bath, which can help you sleep. The details of all aspects are well done. There are 15 choices of pillow menus. The turndown service prepares blood pressure monitors and steam eye masks, but the bed The cushion is a bit soft and the duvet is thick, and the temperature of the air conditioner is very low, and I still wake up in the middle of the night.
There are not many types of soup springs. The steam room of jade agate, Himalayan salt house and ginseng ganoderma is quite special. I like the course setting of health preservation very much, but I need to make an appoin**ent early. Many Tai Chi and paddle board yoga that I want to attend on weekends are full. Experience it After yoga workshops, breathing, meditation and sleep courses, the chakra data has really changed significantly after leaving the store, and the physical and mental state has improved, and I feel that the whole person has been purified
Good morning tea will be delivered to the door of the room in the morning. The buffet breakfast is rich in variety, including fruit and vegetable juices of different physiques
There is a singing bowl show in the lobby at noon, and the aromatherapy essential oils in the hotel corridors will also change according to the time. In short, there is a sense of ritual and it is worth checking in

  The cafeteria is very delicious, and the price is very high. The buffets in chain stores in Shanghai are also at the same price, but the price performance and taste are incomparable.
  I have been here before taking a bath in Hengyue Xinshe, and I am very satisfied, and the first is very clean and the second is very few people, but I feel sorry for it. I hope that more people will know such a good bathing place, so that the business can improve .
 I met waiters Yeager and hinata during my stay, and I am really grateful to them. Yeager helped me get takeaways every time. The doorman's place running back and forth?) Fortunately, Yeager kindly helped me solve this problem. Hinata introduced the room very carefully and clearly, thank you very much.
  The only small downside is that the swimming pool on the top floor is really too small.

The pillows and mattresses in the room are very comfortable. I slept soundly. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because of the bath, or because I went to bed early in the morning, or because I didn‚Äôt go to work the next day. In short, I slept well, and the fabric count is very high. So the pillow is very smooth and comfortable.

Service: Attentive and frequent. The characteristics of the service may be related to physical fitness, tea, and nuts before going to bed. But in fact, I feel that the effect is not good, and I have to persist for a long time. You can switch to something more suitable for your experience. The five-category workshop course experience is very good.
Facilities: We didn't soak in the soup spring, we soaked it in the room. There are few people, and many pools are not open. I ate at the fruit place, and the paella was not good. After steaming in the sauna, the coldness of the iced drink I drank was forced out, and my stomach felt much more comfortable. ÔøºThe water and water in the room, the intelligent system is still somewhat different from that of the newly opened hotel.

3. The housekeepers of the hotel are more enthusiastic, and all the employees of the hotel feel the enthusiasm from the heart! Including the beautiful Russian lady at the front desk!
Of course, there are two things I hope can be improved:
1. The bed in the hotel is soft, not hard enough for my waist, although I have communicated before!
2. Tangquan feels that there is still a little gap from the first-line standard, but the fruit drink is good!
But in general, it is still a very good hotel! recommend!

msg:Due to the self-contained bathhouse, I spent a very cost-effective weekend staying in the hotel this time. We arrived at 3:00 pm on a Saturday, and there were many guests waiting in line to check in in the lobby. It was already past 4 o'clock when all the fancy physical tests were done in the room, and I regretted missing the children's pottery class. Opened the applet and started to make an appoin**ent for the deep sleep course of the day, but found that all the appoin**ents were full, and even all the sound therapy courses that day were full, and only one yoga class was left. Immediately ask the housekeeper for help. After coordination, the housekeeper informed us that the number of deep sleep courses will be increased at night, and we only need to be there at that time. The yoga class at 5 o'clock is a little difficult for novices. All kinds of core strength are used, and after 40 minutes, I sweat a little. There are not many restaurants nearby, so after doing yoga, I quickly drove out to a restaurant one or two kilometers away for dinner. I rushed back to the hotel at 9 o'clock to swim, but the outdoor swimming pool was closed. So I changed my clothes slowly and took a deep sleep course at 10 o'clock. The so-called deep sleep course is that everyone lies together, and the Indian teacher beats the instrument to hypnotize. But most of them were not asleep. Get up at 8 o'clock the next day and have breakfast. The buffet breakfast is very rich, with all kinds of Chinese and Western dim sum. But there are a lot of people, we finished eating at 9 o'clock, and there was already a queue outside the restaurant. Swimming starts at 9:30, the open-air swimming pool is quite small, and the sun is also shining, so I get up at 10:30. I sent my baby to participate in bilingual story yoga, and my teammates and I went to participate in sound therapy at 11 o'clock. Then I found out that there is no need to make an appoin**ent, and it is similar to the deep sleep course. All sleep. Then apply for a late check-out until 1 o'clock, pack the luggage and put it in the car, then check out and go to the bathing place. You can stay in the bath until 0:00 at night. The family of three continued to eat fruit and drinks in the bathing place, the baby went to the children's playground, and the two of us lay flat in the lounge to watch dramas. I really couldn't eat the paella in the set meal at noon, so I changed it to eat at 6 pm. The meal was not big, and I was not full. But because of the birthday, the bathhouse sent another bowl of birthday noodles. Plus fruit drinks are enough. After a full meal, take a bath at home, play in the children's playground and lounge for a while, and go home satisfied.

msg:I have stayed in so many hotels, and this is the first time I write a bad review. At first, I only found some minor flaws, but they were still acceptable. I just wanted to write a few pertinent comments. However, in this short one-night stay, there were a lot of explosive points, which made me feel very bad, my airway and brain were twitching, and I couldn't sleep at all! ! ! I would rather waste time and open my computer overnight to write this bad review.

Preface: I got off the high-speed train with my husband at around 4 o'clock in the afternoon and returned to Shanghai. I suddenly thought of going to the hotel to rest, and I wanted to find a hotel with an outdoor private bath to relax. I originally planned to book ZJ, but unfortunately there was no room. I accidentally saw this and came here. Now think about it, I was really brain cramped at the time. I didn't read the reviews carefully. There are so many good hotels in Shanghai, but I had to come to this broken place to spend money and suffer. (The last post was a few days later)

1. The check-in experience was not good. Arriving at the front desk on the first floor of the hotel, we were informed that we needed to check in on the tenth floor. The lady took us to the tenth floor and was greeted by the staff on the tenth floor. They started to conduct some tests. In fact, we didn't need these. We just wanted to check in quickly. It was indeed our fault for not understanding it clearly in advance, and it was also our fault for being more socially anxious and not mentioning the requirements properly. In fact, it's nothing, just have fun. Finally, the housekeeper took us to the room, and then, she came in directly? ! She came in directly without asking anything! ? Not sure what the rules are. Then she led us in and started to introduce various things, and then we said that we didn't need her to trouble so much, we just need to understand it ourselves, and ask her if we need anything. Then the lady said to me: Are you not used to it yet? I was confused. I felt that there was a possibility? That is, when staying in a hotel, what we want is to feel as comfortable and relaxed as possible, instead of requiring me to adapt to some of your things that will not make most people feel comfortable? Then the lady left, and I was still very grateful.
2. When entering the room, because it had rained, the drainage was not very good, and the terrace was full of water. If we really want to use it, we can actually ask someone to help clean it, maybe... But the bathtub on the terrace can be clearly seen by the upstairs. It is surrounded by the presidential suite upstairs on three sides. No privacy, thank you.
3. The room is small and the layout is unreasonable. The cloakroom and the entrance bathroom are large, the living room and the room are small, and the room can only fit a 1.8 bed. The aisle on the other side of the bed can only be passed sideways against the wall. The narrowness is the same as that of a shared rental house. I can only say that this double-channel design is unnecessary.
4. Dinner was another wrong choice. We went to a self-service western restaurant. I had read the reviews in advance and knew it would not be very good. I thought I would just have a bite, which was already lowered my expectations. It tasted terrible, especially terrible! We didn't expect to provide any better ingredients, but it was too terrible!
The pasta was average.
The curry beef was very dry. I suspect it was basically beef tendon. I'm not sure, but beef brisket should not be this dry.
The crayfish was seasoned just right, and the freshness was not good, not as fresh as the one made in KTV two days ago.
The seasoning of the clams was salty, and the problem was that the sauce was too thick. The clams themselves were very easy to get sauce and were very salty.
The chopped pepper sea bass was too fishy.
The fried rice was extremely dry.
The corn flavor of the pork ribs and corn soup was too strong, but the corn was not delicious, and there was no corn flavor.
Finally, the steak and lamb chops fried by the guy at the middle island were okay. The steak was not of good quality, but it was fried very well. The lamb chops were okay, but they were served with a black pepper and mushroom sauce, which was very mismatched. It seemed that there was only this kind of sauce here.
In short, it was basically a very poor quality home-cooked meal.
5. The hygiene can be said to be very bad! Because we like to sit on the floor, we moved the small table in the bedroom to the side a little, and found that the bottom of the table was full of dust and debris. Because I like to sit on the floor again, I sat down and found that the grooves of the coffee table in the living room were full of shiny oil. I touched it with my hand. It was all yellow oil when I wiped it. I don't know if it was vegetable oil, or someone had a SPA on this small coffee table, or some other oil. (I stayed at x season later, and there was a similar table. I moved the bottom and it was clean.)
6. The most exaggerated thing is here! I might have my period, so I wanted to ask if the front desk provided it. I called to ask, and the front desk said that it would be charged. My husband and I misheard it and heard it as 20 per pack. We did have a problem here. Later, the lady helped to deliver it and said it was 80 per pack. My husband bought it because he was afraid of trouble. Yes, a pack of Japanese Sofie, 80, Japanese sanitary napkins are much cheaper than domestic ones. However, they specially imported Japanese ones and sold them at a high price.
I just came back from Ningbo today. Whether it was the restaurant or the bar I went to yesterday, there was a sticker on the door of the ladies' bathroom saying that if you need it, you can call the front desk to ask for sanitary products. It was very considerate. Now the psychological gap is too big. The hotel I stayed in before didn't have this rule at all. Are you collecting pink tax here? ? ? If you think about it carefully, we can indeed choose not to buy it and buy it ourselves. But if other girls are more anxious, can they have other choices? It's really disgusting to make a fuss about this matter. I think you sell sanitary napkins like this. In order to show the spirit of equal rights, it would be better to sell toilet paper in the same way, right?
7. Before going to bed, the aunt came in to deliver snacks and helped to light the aromatherapy, but did not make the night bed and did not ask at all. I was exhausted and too lazy to speak.
8. Finally, before leaving, the front desk lady gave us two cups of tea. I still thanked her for bringing some comfort to our poor stay experience.

Hotels may have some minor flaws, which are completely understandable. There is absolutely no quality control here! Absolutely not! It's really wrong, the hardware is wrong, the service is wrong, and it's completely out of the ordinary! ! It's just pretending to be five-star on the surface, but it's nothing in essence. When you come out to stay, you should try to choose a group, and you shouldn't choose this kind of street hotel. It feels like you have strayed into a marketing team. There is only marketing, no content! ! The overall stay experience is terrible, not as good as xseason, xhome, or even xhome!

msg:The biggest highlight is the service. There are many and enthusiastic hotel staff: when we checked in, the lady upgraded the room for us. The staff seamlessly guided us to the room. The butler Moon warmly introduced and arranged classes, although the yoga in the morning was really difficult Can't get up and give up. The aunt in the guest room is also very enthusiastic and responds quickly, helping to sterilize the bathtub and replenishing spare parts. When calling customer service, the last name can be accurately reported. Cici helped us interpret the test when we checked out. Several Bellboys went up to carry their luggage together, opened the door, and they were very online.
I went to Tangquan on a Sunday afternoon. There were not many people there. Towels and water were readily available. The locker room staff paid attention to the needs at any time, and would proactively provide disposable underwear and wet clothes in bags without asking.
During the stay, I experienced the seafood buffet in the western restaurant (included in the purchased package). The meals are rich, including freshly opened French oysters, freshly cut tuna, salmon, saury, etc.
According to the physical fitness test, the tea, bedtime aromatherapy, healthy meals, etc. have been known before coming here. This time, I have experienced other details, such as a large round bathtub, which is similar to Mandarin Oriental; Anadi brand rice wine ;Sleep-aiding and healing speakers can simulate various natural sounds; the free drinks in the minibar have two layers; the washlet with automatic lid opening.
The garden design is very exquisite, there are Internet celebrity peacocks; weddings are held for two consecutive days on weekends.

msg:Ctrip grabbed the coupon, 1 room night + soup spring + Spanish rice + balance workshop + cocktail = 1488. In fact, I grabbed 2300+ on Agoda about a month ago, so I didn't hesitate to buy it when I saw the price.
Let me talk about the inconvenient place first, the Spanish rice is in the soup spring, so it must be used together. But unexpectedly, an accident made a suitable arrangement. There is a singing bowl to welcome you when you arrive at the store (super comfortable!), Cici at the front desk arranged a physical test, and tea was arranged in the room according to your physical fitness. Put on the workshop clothes, go to have lunch, after lunch, I participated in the singing bowl class recommended by the restaurant, soaked in hot springs, then went to the gourmet restaurant to get cakes, and ordered noodles to the room (the price is unexpectedly close to the people, although it is a 10% service charge on the price tag) +8% VAT, but after a 10% discount on the meal, the last noodle is less than 56 yuan). Drink a (non-alcoholic) cocktail, take a stress relief class, go to bed to find that the turndown has been made, and a light bedtime snack has been delivered. The next day I got up with wake-up tea, and the breakfast was delicious and rich (there were benedicts and dorayaki). After eating, I went to the garden to see the peacocks, and took part in a singing bowl class.
After participating in the whole process, I suddenly felt that one day was too short. It would be more appropriate to stay for 2 consecutive days next time, otherwise it would be too late to participate in these workshops. I thought I could only register for one class, but it turns out that I can participate in all of them. The bed was a bit soft, and I knew that the mattress could be changed when I left the store~ Cici was harassed by me many times throughout the whole process, she was friendly and could ask questions at any time if she didn't understand~ and considering that I participated in the singing bowl class during the day, she took the initiative to delay it for me Check out, let me go to class with peace of mind. There are so many things to experience, it is really too much to write a review. Suitable for holidays, but also for couples. I will come again next time~

The service staff not only have good looks and good attitudes, but also have flexible thinking, and feel that they have their own ideas in training management.
The classes at the hotel were the highlight, it was a pleasure to try the music therapy and qigong classes; really relaxing. It's a pity that 24 hours is too short to try out classes such as yoga and singing bowls.
The room is okay, the bathtub is big and comfortable. On the contrary, the soup pool in the hot spring hall is relatively small, and it is still complete. Breakfast and dinner in the cafeteria are also good.
Except that the physical fitness test is a bit tasteless, and it doesn't match the actual physical fitness. I drank tea to suppress my appetite for half a day, which made me feel uncomfortable.

Service: The service of the hotel can be called "Haidilao" in the hotel industry. Every step of entering the hotel is guided by service staff. The form of check-in is completely different from other hotels, and the judgment of physical fitness and pressure is very special. Ms. Cici at the front desk conscientiously introduced different projects suitable for us, and responded to every question in time during the stay!

Hygiene: It is worth mentioning that the Anandi Hotel is very clean from the guest rooms to the springs, giving people a very comfortable and reassuring feeling. At the same time, the hotel provides unique loose clothing to make people feel relaxed during their stay.

Just for the unique health healing and comforting service, I will definitely go again!

In the evening, two cups of ginger tea and snacks in thermos cups are delivered. I feel delicious Never stopped. For dinner, I bought a buffet separately. The cod, foie gras and lobster are still good, and there are also free red and white dry and cocktails.

Hot spring link: We went to the hot spring after checking out the next day. We went there as soon as the door opened. There were still relatively few people, and the service staff were very thoughtful. They carefully explained the various procedures and how to use the hot spring pool massage, because the hot spring pool Not much, more than an hour is enough. There is a sauna room.

After arriving at the room, the butler will give you a large thermos cup, which contains herbal tea suitable for your physique.

The experience of staying in the hotel for the first time is very novel. The hardware and software are all in place. Living in the hotel really feels like relaxing in a nursing home. I would also like to thank the housekeeper Helen and the front desk Albert for their thoughtful service, which made the check-in experience even better~

From diet to courses to make you completely relaxed, chakra analysis when you check in, etc. The bells and whistles experience is very interesting, and the free healing touch tickets are loved by both adults and children~ It cost more than 2k just to go to the healing touch before, but now I think it‚Äôs better to stay in a hotel for one night.

msg:On Labor Day, I took my baby to experience the Anadi Hotel and Hengyue Xinshe Hot Spring.
Let me talk about the advantages first: Whether it is the room, the lobby, or the surrounding area of the hotel, it is very beautiful and clean, and it is very comfortable to live in. Especially suitable for parent-child travel. There are little peacocks at the door and the lawn for weddings is so beautiful.
Then the housekeeper, Moon, was also very enthusiastic, and gave us a special drink and a good night salad, which was well received. It is understandable that the holidays are a bit too busy.
Then there is the hot spring, which is very fun to play with the two-year-old baby. There is a children's playground and all kinds of fruits in the hot spring, especially the free coffee, which is delicious, and the waiters will also help you pull flowers, which is very good. There is also a free Spanish paella in the package we ordered, which is also delicious. However, the charge for ice cream is beyond my expectation. It is too cost-effective to buy more than 500 tickets for admission.
Then there are disadvantages: because it was the May Day check-in, there were so many people, the customer service was a bit too busy, and there was a queue for breakfast. I didn't agree to apply for a one-hour late check-out. The experience is average. It is not recommended to play on holidays.
In addition, the front desk and the yoga teacher are foreigners and their Chinese is not good, so it is not very comfortable to communicate.
Also, I took a core yoga class, the content is too simple and only suitable for beginners or people who just want to relax.
In the end, there is one dissatisfaction. Our package includes a free cocktail. It is difficult to drink juice like supermarkets... There is no alcohol taste at all. After we finished drinking, we wanted to spend our own money to order drinks, and then the girls at the bar counters asked three questions... It seemed that they couldn't make cocktails (this is the bar in the lobby on the 1st floor), and they were a little speechless.
Generally speaking, the staying experience is good, but it is better for everyone to come to play when there are fewer people on weekdays!

He is just right and considerate, and every detail is taken care of. He is worthy of the hotel class Haidilao. Before check-in, the hotel will confirm the license plate and hotel details for you, free parking; there will be a five-element chakra test when you check-in... I won‚Äôt say much else, the restaurant is delicious, and the breakfast is rich. These are the basic operations. The happiest thing is to wake up in the morning Open the door and two cups of warm wake-up tea are already under the door. It is very suitable for the warm and cold spring in Shanghai, and the whole person is woken up. Special thanks to the butler Una!
Tips: When you check in, make an appoin**ent for the workshop class first, otherwise there is a high probability that you will not be able to make an appoin**ent for a good classüòÇ
The only downside: it's a bit close to the airport, in the morning, for example, I wake up very easily and can hear the plane ‚úàÔ∏è

msg:I went to this hotel for the second time, and the experience was much better this time. Last time, there were too many people and there were a lot of pitfalls. This time, the parent-child room was upgraded for free, and the children liked it very much. Hengyue Tangquan has changed to a single time. It used to be unlimited in and out during the stay. Before check-in, the staff confirmed the room and meals in advance. Three families went together, but only a friend butler took the initiative to add WeChat.
Improvement points: The bathtub was not cleaned, and the water was yellow when it was flushed. It should be that the previous customer did not clean up the traditional Chinese medicine soup. It was very hasty to ask the waiter to come over and do a second cleaning. It was not clean. In the end, I dared not give it Children soak. This kind of parent-child one still needs to be disinfected well, so it is not at ease to bring children like this.

As soon as you enter the hotel, you can smell the smell of ginger flower
There is a sense of ceremony when you check in
They will also help every guest to do a physical test, and then send a bracelet and corresponding tea
After entering the room, the customer service staff also explained patiently, I am afraid that you may have doubts
The lawn of the hotel is beautiful. There are weddings almost every day. Seeing the sweet appearance of the couple, I am so envious. There were no such beautiful hotels before
If you have a peacock, if you are lucky, you may even meet a peacock spreading its tail
Warm soup is also good and there are many workshop courses, there is always one that suits you
I especially recommend the hotel‚Äôs breakfast. It‚Äôs really good. That bowl of small wontons has left me with a long aftertaste. I just have to get up early, or I‚Äôll have to wait for a seat.

But what people didn't expect was that on the second day, the service of that Hengyue Hot Spring was so disappointing. After we finished soaking, we ordered a set meal in the rest area and added a sea urchin. Unexpectedly, there are ten sea urchins in a serving, which is still less, or four less. Fortunately, we took a photo first, and they layered him up. I couldn‚Äôt explain clearly, so I asked the waiter to respond, but it turned out that we didn‚Äôt care about it, as if we were looking for trouble, and finally got angry, and made up the four of us as rewards, but didn‚Äôt agree. Finally, the foreman said that there was no charge for sea urchins. I was offering 10% off or 15% off for our other dishes. I forgot, but when I went downstairs to pay the bill, the cashier said that there was no such thing, and I wanted to pay all the bills. I asked her to call and ask, and said that no one was beaten. Then, I finally said that I was going to check out. If there is no such thing as a deposit, you can call the hotel to deduct the deposit, and then let us go, as if I lied to them, it is too bad, the service is a mess.

Facilities: The facilities look very new. We even went to the upstairs gym for a walk. I feel that they are all professional-grade equipment, and they all look new. Water and towels are thoughtfully placed on each treadmill in advance.
Hygiene: very clean. Couldn't find a single fault in the room, even the corners were clean. The scented candles in the corner of the toilet have no dust.
Environment: It doesn't look like a big hotel from the outside, but when you go in, you'll see it. The lobby is very bright and a**ospheric, the hotel room is also big, the toilet is also big, and the layout is reasonable.
Service: Star service from the moment we enter the door, whether it is the gentle and beautiful foreign girl at the front desk who speaks fluent Mandarin, the customer service guy who takes our luggage all the way upstairs, or the caring and enthusiastic room housekeeper, all deserve praise.
Especially the housekeeper girl, when we went out for dinner, the housekeeper not only helped us order aromatherapy, put away salads and a series of sleeping items, but also helped us hang up and fold the clothes we took off. People admire.
Dining: On the first floor, there is a buffet with high reviews. I like cooked drunken shrimp the most, the seasoning is perfect. The pastry is amazing, beautiful and delicious. There are also peacocks outside the restaurant for close viewing.
There are also Chinese restaurants and Japanese cuisine upstairs to choose from.
The breakfast is also in the same place, and there are many varieties, which can be ranked among the five-star hotels. For example, Hong Kong-style shrimp dumpling siu mai is better than some tea restaurants outside. I especially like their pastry chef, who is absolutely a master. There are many kinds of pastries, with high appearance and good taste.
At the beginning, when entering the hotel, you will fill in forms and measure your body energy, knowing that everyone has a different physique. As soon as you enter the room, the butler will serve tea suitable for different physiques, and quinoa salad in the evening. Early the next morning, there was ginger tea at the door, and I really ate and drank non-stop.
There are free chocolate and nut snacks in the room, as well as free Coke Sprite sparkling water beer. There are also steam eye masks for sleeping at night. It can also measure the blood pressure of the elders. Anyway, everything is available.
Hot springs: Hot springs are provided when you stay in the hotel. Just bring a swimsuit. There are hot springs both indoors and outdoors, and there will be snowfall outside to create an a**osphere. You can take the elevator to the second floor, sit on the sofa chair and bask in the sun to eat and drink. There are free imported fruits and beverages next to it, with a complete range of varieties, and you can drink and eat freely. There is a chess and card room on the third floor for entertainment. It's just that this elevator is a bit difficult to find, you can ask the customer service.
Activities: You can make an appoin**ent or cancel on the WeChat applet according to the schedule. If you calculate the time correctly, you can play in the hotel for a day, and you will never be bored. In the morning, I participated in the singing bowl sound therapy. The teacher was very good and gave people a good experience. After the end, the whole person was indescribably comfortable.
Location: If you have to pick a fault, it's that their house is a bit out of the way and the bus is inconvenient, but at the same time the hotel is quiet. Parking is free, and the license plate number is entered in advance, so you don't have to worry about going out.
When you check out, you will also get a small gift from Lancome, which is a bit high-end.
Anyway, it's a very worthwhile hotel, and I will come again. üòçüòçüòç

Environment: Small aroma diffusers can be seen everywhere in the hotel, it seems to smell two kinds of lemon and orange, generally speaking, it is very elegant

Service: Zoe's butler service must be given five-star praise! I personally like the butler-style service very much. First, there are many things about staying in the hotel (such as workshop courses, the rights and interests we can enjoy) that can be consulted with the butler. Second, there is a special arrangement in the hotel where someone can take care of me (such as zoe help I received flash delivery and express delivery to the room, thank you very much) This is an experience that most five-star hotels do not have. I hope Anadi can maintain it well and continue to optimize itüëçüèª
Because I helped arrange the room upgrade, I also received very good care at the check in&out of the executive lounge. Oliver's very considerate service also drew a perfect end to my experience in Anadi~
Another plus point is that all the employees here will smile and greet the guests generously. When we went to the hot spring, we happened to meet the employees who had a meeting and dismissed it. We received a lot of greetings from the employees, and we really felt very warm

Unlimited Hengyue hot springs for two people: The types and quantity of hot springs are still different from some of the more famous hot springs. If we can introduce carbonated springs and skin-beautifying springs, I believe it will be more popular! At present, Tangquan is a service provided by the hotel, which is still good, and it is especially suitable for bringing children to play.

Healthy snacks on the first day: The so-called healthy snacks are healthy tastes, just try them out. Personally, I think that Anadi‚Äôs must-try delicacies include: preserved egg porridge with lean meat and small wontons for breakfast; after soaking in the soup, go to the upstairs rest area to drink an iced coconut! beautiful

It's a pity that I don't have time to experience too many workshop courses this time. I sincerely hope that I will have the opportunity to live again in the future and have a good rest!

Finally, I would like to give you a little tip: I actually saw in the comment area that there was a birthday cake arrangement, and I didn‚Äôt enjoy it, but this is not just needed for me, so I think it‚Äôs okay, but if you have a birthday in a hotel If you really need the hotel‚Äôs help to prepare cakes, remember to communicate with the butler in advance; the hotel‚Äôs Deep Sleep Workshop course is very good, but the sound of some guests‚Äô snoring also affects the experience.

First, I did a physical fitness test, and gave health tea according to my physical fitness. After I went upstairs, a housekeeper connected with various courses, and made appoin**ents for parent-child yoga. It's just that our housekeeper is not proficient in business, can't answer many questions, and stutters a bit. Dinner is in the secret place. A birthday cake was prepared for us. The cod fish steak is delicious, but the food is not as rich as the legend. The breakfast the next day was very good and very rich. Checked in the hotel's hot springs, and looked at the market price. To be honest, if you don't go to the hotel, it's not worth just checking in to the hot springs. There are not many bathing pools, and there is no sweat steaming. The price of back rubbing is very high, the key point is that it is quite small. But fruit drinks, coffee, hot tea, and freshly squeezed juices are all you can drink.

msg:Dad wants to take a bath, and mother likes buffets. I wanted to find a place similar to Bliss Soup online, but I feel that there are too many people. If you want to find a place with a better environment and less people, you will lock on Anadi's hot spring! Ctrip happened to have a package of hot spring + hotel + buffet dinner. Parents like it, so I took them there!

It is a hotel that can heal.

When I was soaking in the soup in the afternoon, I happened to see their artificial snowfall. Although it was not real snow, I could feel the happiness of watching the snow while soaking in the soup. Tangchi's massage system relaxed the muscles with lactic acid accumulation, changed clothes, sat on the second floor to rest, and looked at the blue sky outside the window, feeling extremely comfortable in my heart.

I ate the buffet at night, without reducing the quality of the food because of the buffet. The salmon is fresh, the vinaigrette of the bread has rosemary spices, and the creamy cake has the same taste as Xiao Fang. Eating cheese while drinking is extremely comfortable.

Although the deep sleep course at night and the breathing course in the morning are only 30 minutes, the quality of the course has not declined because of the hotel.

Ms. Tiffeny in the executive lounge is kind and meticulous. Although the staff wear masks, they all look good and their uniforms are also good-looking.

I saw some comments saying that the service is not good. I feel that it is difficult to guarantee perfection when there are too many people, but the overall service level is higher than that of five-star hotels.

The afternoon tea cake in the executive lounge is superb. I tried the Japanese food on the second floor in the evening. Three people ate a set meal for two to fill up. I missed the happy hour in the executive lounge... The hotel's course is the biggest highlight, the Indian teacher's meditation class It was very rewarding, and it made some sense. The Deep Sleep Workshop seemed a bit simple. I practiced Tai Chi the next morning. The teacher was very responsible. I taught half a set of movements in an hour, and I could basically learn them. The hot spring is more suitable for bringing children, it is very happy. The biggest surprise of this stay is the shower room. One of the bridles feels like standing under a waterfall. The water pressure is super strong. I really want to install one at home.

msg:To sum it up, "a lot of surprises"
1. When applying for employment, a bunch of beauties and handsome guys asked us to do various physical examinations. We thought that we had encountered an MLM organization, so it became the only choice. It is really one of the special services, giving guests the opportunity to sublimate both soul and body. 2. In fact, it takes courage to spend money to stay in this hotel. There is no view, no location, and the mentality of taking a gamble came in. There are many surprises-there is actually a hot spring playground, which is suitable for parent-child activities. It should be the only one in Shanghai, and then The meals in the hotel package are really good. The breakfast is higher than the standard of a five-star hotel in Shanghai. The hotel itself on the edge of the city immediately arranged a seafood dinner set, which exceeded expectations. The only thing to note is that the prawns, lamb chops and steaks are hidden behind and need patience. to wait. 3. The enthusiastic ice-breaking reception by the housekeeper Sana made the family feel like a spring breeze. They immediately drank the water-fire-wind tea that can change the physique, and felt much better. Today, Hunter, the room manager, found the famous book signed by a famous author that we had lost for several days, which completely relieved the pressure on the family. The staff I met in the hotel were very professional and enthusiastic. The underground parking garage guide was small Brother immediately sent the temperature of the hotel, I didn't remember your name, sorry, it may be the empathy in the corporate culture that sublimates the soul, and can quickly integrate the guests. Because of its narrow structure, I didn't participate in too many soul-deep reconciliation projects. I only participated in the 45-minute course of cymbal sound therapy, which was not bad. I asked my family members, and they all said yes, everyone is really good, so I look forward to coming back for vacation next time.

The fly in the oin**ent is: 1. The toilet does not have a washlet at this price. How much trouble has it caused us? The hotel owners have never lived in their own rooms? 2 My big sofa cannot be used as a children's bed, and the embarrassment of parent-child travel has broken out!

Unexpectedly, the check-in experience was really wonderful. First, Mr. Mori took us to check in on the tenth floor, and then Ryan received us very warmly, and even upgraded us with administrative courtesy. Really nice. After checking out, I also introduced to me the snowmaking activities in the Tangquan Hall of the hotel. It was a little regretful that I didn‚Äôt see it when it rained last night. Wait until next time.

After putting the babies down at night, I also experienced the Ayurvedic heart chakra oil drop project, which was really great. Shanghai SPA ceiling!

Woke up early to receive good morning tea at the door of the room, so thoughtful.

I really like the five major balance courses in the hotel, especially the sound therapy. I can actually see the color of my crown chakra and heart chakra in the second time. My overall chakra color changed when I left too lol.

Countless waiters in the hotel told us Happy New Year, so happy. I wish you all the best and success in the new year.

3. The service staff are basically very polite, which is not bad... 3.5 points.
Suggested improvements:
1. The collusion of guest information needs to be improved. It seems that it is not very clear if there is any modification or addition. It may be easy to mess up the courses due to the large number of people.
2. The M layer of Xinshe recommends adding a front desk guide.
3. The moving lines of the restaurant and the moving lines of the residents can be staggered, so that it will not look chaotic.

When taking a shower with the wall-mounted shower head, the shower head above the head will drip cold water. It takes 5 minutes to stop, and the whole process is nestled in the corner to take a bath.

Tangquan is a bit small, and the bathing, playing, and dining areas are relatively small. There are only 3 hair dryers in the women's bathroom, and it is absolutely hard to find one during peak hours.

Don't mention too many good things, the flaws are not hidden, and the stay experience is happy.

msg:I bought a set meal, including soup spring and a buffet.

Let me talk about Tang Quan first:
Hot springs in five-star hotels. Checked in on Sunday, not too many people. The seating area is almost full but doesn't feel crowded

The waiters will take the initiative to say hello when they see it, and they are very timely in handing over towels and clothes


First, there is a mixed pool of men and women, wearing swimsuits. There are three hot springs inside. The pool is still very big, and there are yoga classes in the afternoon

The steaming area and the rest area are together, and there are three steaming rooms, not too big, but very clean

There are more than a dozen kinds of beverages in the rest area, and you can order freshly squeezed juice, coffee, tea, etc., which are also included in the fare. There is also coconut green, not bad

The bathing area is separated by a single compar**ent, and there is a place to put clothes in each room, the design is very good

Some small suggestions:
There is only one basin in the changing area, which is not enough when there are many guests.
The comb is not disposable and has hair on it. It would be nice if there were disposables available or at least alcohol for everyone to spray
There is a steam room in the changing area. There is a steam outlet at the foot of the door. There is no reminder, and it is hot. Fortunately, it jumps away faster.

Overall it is still recommended.

buffet:
The number of dishes exceeded expectations. Red wine is included in the meal price.

Japanese food stalls: There are five or six kinds of sashimi.
Cold food stalls: Drunken crab and shrimp
Barbecue stalls: steak, lamb chops, grilled chicken, grilled squid, grilled autumn knife, grilled bone meat, plum blossom meat, and oysters
Noodle stall: noodles, small wontons
Fruits: five or six kinds
Dessert: This part exceeds expectations in terms of taste, quantity, and appearance
Ice cream: Haagen-Dazs six or seven flavors
Finally: There are unlimited hairy crabs!

The room and the hotel itself:
The hotel focuses on health and relaxation, and essential oil aromatherapy fills the entire hotel. When staying in the hotel, you can choose various courses, such as yoga and meditation. There will be a set of clothes when you check in, which can be worn in the hotel or in class.

The details of the room are in place, and there are blood pressure monitors, sleep aids and so on. There is a butler service, the physical fitness will be tested first when you check in, and tea and snacks will be served according to your physical fitness. The experience is very good.

Overall it was a great stay, and I will go again.

msg:I bought a group-buying coupon in the live broadcast room to experience the health hotel. The experience was really good when I first arrived at the hotel. One-on-one butler service, afternoon tea in the executive lounge, and buffet dinner all felt very good. From the beginning of soaking in the hot springs, I slowly felt something wrong. The bleach water in the 3 pools in the hot spring room had a strong smell, which made you want to put on a mask quickly. After soaking in the hot spring and returning to the room, we stayed in rooms 356 and 357. In room 356, I took a shower and was about to go to bed. As soon as I sat on the bed, I felt the bed suddenly move and collapse on one side. It was around 12 o'clock in the middle of the night, and I informed the front desk. The engineer came up and checked and found that even the screws were flying. Later, I found it on the other side. Everyone with a little common sense can find that this was a hidden danger before. A wheel is fixed with 4 screws. If so, is it possible? There are serious risks. Later, the lobby manager changed the room to a so-called executive suite, but the room was smaller than the original one, with a smaller bed and no balcony outside the world. Everyone who wants to book an executive suite should pay attention. Since it was too late, we had to change the room, but the new room was always in shadow, and we didn't go to sleep until 2 o'clock in the morning. We often travel and stay in hotels, and this is the first time we have encountered this. This morning, I called the front desk to ask to deal with this matter. The solution given by the hotel was to extend the check-out until 6 pm and give a souvenir. I disagreed and did not want it. There have been no new proposals so far. My adult slept yesterday. May I ask the hotel management, if a child likes to bounce on the bed, knocks his head on the wall, and goes to the hospital, do you also give gifts and late check-out? The feeling of the hotel is that the service is good, but the management is poor. Please see the photos for the hardware bed frame. Everyone see clearly, personal share! What I am sharing now is here, and I will share it when there is a live broadcast room!

There are few things in the executive lounge and the taste is not good, sorry for the price of the room
Overall, it's good to experience it, but I don't have the desire to come back

It was originally a second hotel, and it felt like it should be okay, but from the beginning of check-in, it was waiting...waiting...and then cumbersome procedures. That's fine. We started to urge us to check out after 12:00. The country stipulates that a day is 24 hours. What reason do you have to tell me that if you check in at 16:00, you must leave at 12:00, and you will deduct 1/6 of the time for nothing. What is this? What about the overlord clause? The most important thing is: after the final check-out, my hotel deposit was deducted for no reason, but I did not spend anything. Fortunately, we had lunch in the lobby bar and haven't left yet. After the deduction occurred, we happened to be in the dessert house. I asked the staff to ask. The staff said that the bill showed that the bill was spent in the dessert house, but the dessert house also clearly stated that I did not consume it. The key was to ask me when I checked out if I had any consumption. , I also clearly told no! ! ! ...really speechless üòì A very bad hotel experience!

Many customers need more than one, so the queue time is normal for half an hour. There are constant conflicts in the restaurant due to queuing, picking up meals, serving wrong dishes, etc., which affects the mood. I hope to pay attention to handling these problems and improve solutions.

The location of the hotel is on the outskirts of the city, so the environment is far from the city and it is very quiet
As soon as I entered the hotel, I was surrounded by essential oils and the sound of cymbals. It is no exaggeration to say that I want to sleep when I enter the hotel üòÇ
From the moment you check in at the front desk, the waiter has been taking you to welcome check-in ceremonies such as energy test. According to the energy value, a bracelet will be arranged for you. During the National Day, a small lancome gift box will be given üéÅ
After you get the room card and get to the floor, a housekeeper (steven) will take you into the room (and give you a thermos bottle filled with delicious tea, which can be refilled indefinitely üòÇ) visit the introduction and recommend the energy value that is suitable for you The hotel wellness course I participated in was so caring and enthusiastic. During the stay in the hotel, if you have any questions, you can contact her if you need it. You can also choose suitable pillows before going to bed at night. There are 15 types of pillows in total, which is too friendly for me who has poor sleep quality üòÑ
The service experience of the whole hotel is full of experience. When you go out, someone will say hello and answer all questions with a smile.
Besides, I booked a 2888 super package for the hotel's catering and holidays, which includes a buffet dinner and breakfast for two and a soup package for two. It can be said to be the most cost-effective hotel experience. I don't have to leave the hotel at night. The seafood package is full of variety and taste. It's pretty good. There is also an all-you-can-drink restaurant. Fruit drinks and ice cream are refreshing üòÇ
Finally, I will comment on the hotel's health course. I experienced a bowl sound and meditation on the day of check-in. The bowl sound really makes you relax and fall asleep in these common frequency sounds. Meditation is a course that needs to be learned and practiced. The class is taught by an Indian teacher who is very professional
This hotel is very good, will definitely come again

While full of exotic flavors, the design does not deliberately highlight the theme of health preservation. It is intentional and unique, simple and a**ospheric.

Many details in the room reflect the intention to pay attention to sleep quality. Nano floor, Himalayan salt lamp, earth bed, soaking pool and traditional Chinese medicine bath bag, TV with sleep aid music equipped with Bose audio, sleep aid instrument, eye mask, blood pressure monitor , essential oil aromatherapy machine, and a variety of pillows to choose from.

It is divided into several areas without disturbing each other. The meals provided are also very good. Take a singing bowl sound therapy and sleep class, both ways to relax. Although the occupancy rate was high, the room was quiet. There is also a nucleic acid testing point in the underground garage of the hotel. This is a very warm hotel.

The hotel was accommodated by a close contact person, and because of the simultaneous space problem, it was screened and isolated. Although I can't go home, the hotel provides free accommodation and meals, especially the attitude of the little brother at the front desk is very good. Although the current isolation made it difficult for me to sleep all night, the sound sleep music in the room and the attitude of the waiters made me feel a little more at ease. Fortunately, Changning District let everyone leave after the nucleic acid was OK twice in a row, thank you

The singing bowl sound therapy course is super recommended, many people fell asleep, hahaha. I originally wanted to do Tai Chi, but it was only available on Saturday and Sunday morning. It seems that I have to arrange it again next time.
There are not many varieties of seafood buffet dinner, but the taste is not bad, the tableware is very delicate, and there are not many guests dining on weekdays.
The service of the hotel is really a plus, and the details are thoughtful
Parking is also very convenient, the garage is the hotel lobby

msg:The hotel is very untouchable. It has all the qualities of a luxury hotel, as well as unique workshop courses, pillow selection, food selection and other services. The swimming pool is also very good. Check-in is one-to-one, which can be said to be a five-star hotel Some of the administrative services are sunk to all rooms in the hotel, and you can enjoy it when you check in. The whole hotel is full of fragrance and piano sound, and it can be used for a long stay or a small stay.
There is a general feeling: the check-in time is longer, probably because the process has to be completed? It took about two hours until the subsequent selection of pillows and welcome tea. In fact, I feel that in addition to the check-in information, everything else can be handled in the room or intelligently selected by self-service. For example, the WeChat client can choose the desired pillow. Due to the many services provided by the hotel, there will be problems such as information transmission errors when the waiter is handed over. For example, when I dropped a pillow, I sent a pillow core first, and then sent a pillow case.
Overall is good. Including the existing problems, it is also based on the premise of providing high-quality and perfect services to the guests. The heart of the hotel is rare, I hope the hotel will become better and better, and I want to stay next timeüòå

The whole environment of the hotel and some courses are really good for self-cultivation. I didn't participate in the spa this time, but I gave it to my friends to enjoy. Next time I stay, I will feel the way of the spa.
I was quite relaxed during the process. There is such a hotel to relax my body and mind during the epidemic. Very happy.
Of course, it would be better if there were more seafood in the buffet.
I will still choose to stay next time, I hope the experience can be better.

The environment is not luxurious, but very simple and healing. In the recent epidemic, the most important thing is that there are few people and quietness.

Spa is also expensive because there are few people, and it is hard to buy a clean! The aunt in the pool is very kind and enthusiastic, and is very active in introducing various functions.

Workshop classes are good and crowded.

The butler service is good, but there is still room for improvement. Maybe everyone manages too many rooms, and it feels a little busy.

Praise the restaurant, every restaurant is delicious, buffet, Japanese food, Chinese food are all online.

However, on such a hot day, the electricity in the room was cut off before I could change the room, which caused us to sit in a room with no air conditioner and no lights.

msg:This year I chose Anadi for the New Year's Eve. After comparing many hotels on the Bund, I was finally moved by the concept of healing and chose this one.
Overall four stars, but still far from 5 stars.
environment:
The location of the hotel is not very good, there is no scenery around Beixinjing. But it can be regarded as quiet amidst the hustle and bustle. The hotel is next to the river, and the scenery is also considered quiet and elegant. The interior of the hotel is also very design. The room is comfortable.
Serve:
All the staff encountered were friendly and kind. But on the whole, it is standardized and friendly, and the user‚Äôs perspective is still a bit poor. The details are as follows, 1. After the chakra test at the time of check-in, there is no explanation. Pass. No one reminded me to take pictures and save them. Later, when Teacher Yinliao asked me, I was stunned. 2. The so-called room butler did not take the initiative to remind the whole healing service, the aromatherapy for going to bed late, and the morning tea for early waking without any explanation, including the workshop courses that can be reserved, and did not take the initiative to introduce. As a result, I missed an appoin**ent for the New Year's Eve concert. 3. I hope the butler can call me back after asking if it is possible to add people to the New Year's Eve concert. I haven't waited for the call yet, so I called the front desk and asked. The solution given to me by the front desk was to wait at the door at 8.30 to see if there was any space available. ? ? ? You said that you help the guests record and line up, is it more appropriate to call the waiters when there are vacancies? 3. Since I have a child with me, I want a glass of milk at night, so I replied that I need to order and pay for the meal. So my husband can only go to the spa again in winter to get a sign and then go upstairs to get a glass of milk. So why can't these things be solved proactively for customers?
The quality of the buffet is average, and the price/performance ratio for more than 500 people per person during the festival is extremely low.
The difference between excellence and excellence lies in the details. If we are truly user-centered, everything will be humanized care, not all procedures, rules, and systems.

From the time I checked in to the executive floor on the 10th floor and waited for the elevator, I was healed by the aromatherapy in the lobby, and then While waiting for check-in, there are also self-service drinks and snacks. I was told to upgrade at the beginning, but when I checked in, I found out that it was the room type that was booked. What is the upgrade? The hotel&#39;s environment and room layout are very good. I also participated in two classes. The class at 4 o&#39;clock in the afternoon was full of people, and there were not many people in the yin yoga class at 8 o&#39;clock in the evening... Everyone is probably tired? Haha, the hot springs in the hotel are relatively ordinary. The water at 38.5 degrees does not feel like a hot spring. However, the women&#39;s products at the hot springs are quite elegant, and the skin care products are very good! The hair dryer also has Dyson (the hair dryer in the room that is not cheap is not very elegant) and decided to go back to the room to have a bar. There are also two bathtubs in the room~ One of the gimmicks of the hotel has an additional 15 pillows to choose from, but In fact, the three pillows provided by the hotel are already very comfortable. The elasticity and comfort of the gimmick pillows are not as good as their own. The butler service of the hotel is still good. The hot drinks sent are especially suitable, which not only satisfy the desire to drink hot drinks but also avoid boiling hot water. The breakfast was a bit embarrassing. The reservation was at 9:00, and it didn&#39;t arrive until almost 9:30. I asked the waiter for a cup of coffee and waited until the breakfast was over. I had to call the housekeeper to deliver it... During the epidemic, the gym and swimming pool were all closed. Not open, looking forward to the next time~

msg:As soon as I entered the hotel, the refreshing scent made me feel very comfortable, the energy detection was very interesting, and there were various workshops worth experiencing. I added hot spring yoga and dead sea floating, but dead sea floating is not suitable for me hahaha. Personally, I like the bowl song very much, and 432HZ is very comfortable to listen to. There are many details that contain energy fields hidden here, which are worth looking into. It is a good place to hide in the city.

msg:Stay with parents on weekends. In the executive lounge, I tested chakras, had afternoon tea, and made an appoin**ent for a class. The dinner buffet seemed better than before, the steaks and lamb chops were all fresh.
In particular, I met Oliver Liu, the executive lounge manager, who is one of the few outstanding hotel practitioners I have met in so many hotels over the years! Since I had something important to do on the day of check-out, I came back late, so I specially delayed the check-out for us. Considering the comfort of the elderly staying in the hotel, I specially waited at the entrance of the lounge so that they could continue to use the afternoon tea in the lounge. Although my parents are really embarrassed that they didn't go to use it, the awareness of putting themselves in the customer's shoes and serving them is very touching! It is recommended that the hotel consider reuse and promotion!
PS: In contrast, when we went to the first floor for breakfast on October 30, several waiters and a male manager with glasses at the entrance of the restaurant stopped us from letting us in for breakfast! Said the room only included 2 breakfasts and there were 3 of us. I explained that when I checked in, the executive lounge manager said that since we are a family suite, breakfast and afternoon tea are included for 3. Unexpectedly, the male manager said: They said it doesn't count! I questioned him at the time, do I believe or not believe what anyone in your hotel said to me? ! He saw that I was tough and said that I would take you in first, but to be clear, we originally only included 2 breakfasts! I said how can you talk like that? What is "speaking clearly"? ! How can such a person manage? A single mouse feces ruined a pot of soup! Don't the guests want to take advantage of the hotel, and they have stayed for thousands of nights. Can't they afford breakfast? If we hadn't met oliver, we might never have gone again!
The hotel's main focus on health care is very good. I look forward to further improvement in soft services and can learn from oliver!

I started to contact the hotel at 10.00 in the morning, and the front desk told me that there would be a discount. Later, I called and said that the price would be increased by 400. I also agreed to the increase. After a while, he said that he could not renew the stay, the room was reserved by someone else, and there was a two-hour break in the middle, and finally he was forced to check out of the hotel without a single apology. I don't want to say anything about the service, and the so-called sleep therapy is just a few more pillows and an aromatherapy. The overall facilities of the room are not very five-star, and the experience is very bad. Compared with other five-star, there are This price choice is not as good as going to the city or Pudong

The service is really considerate. The environment is also very private. There are not many fruits and drinks. The fruit is washed and clean. The breakfast is rich in variety. While eating, look at the Peacock Executive Lounge. The snacks are also delicious. You can book workshop courses during the day. I personally recommend singing bowls to relax your body and mind. The juices, tea soups and snacks prepared for your body are all very good every day. They can promote body detoxification. Anadi is the only hotel that I stayed in the hotel for the first night without insomnia. Maybe the a**osphere is very good. The aroma is very relaxing and the sound effects that help sleep. There are more than a dozen types of pillows in the pillow menu. There is always one suitable for you. In addition, special thanks to the housekeeper Winter and the manager Jenny for making good arrangements for our stay.

First of all, the service is really good. Due to the Chinese New Year, there are a lot of guests, but the service is still well-organized, basically responsive, and the hotel does have its own characteristics, which are different from ordinary hotels. The physique will provide tea that suits you, and the hotel also has various special courses, so you will not be bored in the hotel for a day! However, due to the winter, the swimming pool is not open, it is more suitable for adults, not suitable for parents and children, because many courses cannot be attended by children!

msg:üîîService: Excellent service, took my mother to experience the Anandi Health Hotel and its newly opened water house on the weekend. Walking in any corner of the hotel, you can feel the enthusiasm of every waiter. The purchased room includes executive courtesy, check in will be arranged on the 10th floor, there are few people, and you can also want to use their afternoon tea while waiting, in addition, there is happy hour in the evening. The newly opened spa is also looking forward to it. The service of the aunt who soaked in the hot spring in the water house is really attentive, and she explained the characteristics of each pool carefully to us. Secondly, the swimsuit will also have a dehydration service. The swimsuit after taking off the water is not only quick-drying, but also if you want to go to the soup after a rest, it will not be very difficult to put on and take off, which is very good. The coconut in the spa is really good. After soaking in the soup and drinking one, lying on the sofa is simply enjoyable. Taken together, it took almost half a day to play the water house.

üçÉEnvironment: My mother highly praised the decoration design of this hotel, and the aromatherapy essential oil diffused everywhere in the hotel is also very pleasant to smell.

üöó Transportation: I went to live there twice, once by self-driving and once by taxi. Every time I go, I make a magical mistake, and the location is a little out of the way.

Just eat, drink, play, and play, and the two-day and one-night health journey will soon come to an end. I have stayed in many hotels with my mother, but I am full of praise for it. Haha good review.

There are not many people in the course, the experience is acceptable, and the schedule for two days and one night is full.
The quality of the buffet meals is indeed high, but it is not suitable for workshop classes if you are too full.
In short, taking two days to relax here has a good effect.

msg:The hotel executive room package temporarily booked one day in advance contains a lot of things, but enjoys very little.
On the night of the reservation, a housekeeper called to confirm the check-in time and the number of people. In addition, I informed that the buffet was full and could only order meals to the room or other restaurants (500 coupons for the package). Because I brought children, I also informed that children's toiletries would be prepared and sent Confirm by text message. I didn't expect to check in the next day, it was really messy. It should be that many guests who bought the package all checked in at 2 o'clock. There is no place to sit, and I don't know who to hand our ID card to. After waiting for a long time, I asked the staff to tell the staff that there were too many people and we would have to wait longer. In the end, I checked in without doing any pre-occupancy physical examination. After finishing the job, it was said that a staff member sent it to the room, but as a result, no one went down the stairs. I had to find a room by myself (there is no so-called room introduction). There are no children's products, no welcome snacks, no healthy meals, no healthy tea, and no supper in the room. I didn't see my housekeeper from beginning to end, and of course I was too lazy to ask, I could only call the front desk if there was anything.
The buffet is full but you can leave a phone number when you go to the restaurant for renovation. Someone will call to let you know when they leave. It was told at 7 o'clock that we could dine, and the things in the restaurant were still being added mechanically, because we went there late. I specially sent sashimi and a tiger spot. I am very grateful to the staff in the restaurant depar**ent for this!
Because it took a lot of time to check in, and there were a lot of things to do with small children, I didn't participate in any activity courses on the first day. The children had to sleep in late and had to eat breakfast, so I discussed with the front desk whether we could delay the check-out for a while. Because the spa hasn't gone yet. Was told no, the room was full. That said, can the spa go after check-out. That way the time won't be too tight. Not even being told. Anyway, that's not the way it is. I was in a very bad mood and didn‚Äôt want to go there anymore, but my husband wanted to experience it, so he hurriedly dragged the children to get up, hurriedly ate breakfast, went to the spa for a while and lay down for a while before rushing back to pack and check out . The spa is still good. Toiletries are good, service is also good. But without in-depth experience, I could only give up if I wanted to be a SPA.
In general. It was a bad experience. The so-called health hotel ceiling has no experience at all, there is no time to participate in yoga, the spa goes through the motions, and there is no turndown service. The one-to-one housekeeper has never even seen a person, nor has he taken the initiative to ask what he needs. I felt like I was staying in an ordinary five-star hotel.
I understand that there will be such a situation when there are many people in the Spring Festival. Just hope the hotel doesn't just make money blindly. Guaranteeing quality and customer experience is the most important thing. If you want to experience it, don't come on holidays.

msg:Very general, should not go a second time. I checked in on New Year's Eve and checked out on the first day of the new year. I understand the special time period, but obviously the hotel needs to improve the details.
First of all, it is not obvious to find the check-in place when you come up from the elevator in the parking garage. If you come in the lobby, you will find a place where you can sit and check in, but when you come up from the basement, you will see the reception desk. Only 1 person. When we arrived at 1330 pm, there was only one employee surrounded by 6 or 7 ladies, and the other was not on duty. Sitting for checkin is crowded with people, and there is no one to guide (at this time, there is a duty patrol in the lobby)
Second, I have only contacted the housekeeper you mentioned twice. Once, before check-in, he confirmed with me what time to order dinner and added my WeChat account. Another time when I went to the room, I was guided to the room on the floor, and the usual introduction time was 10-15min. It is said that you can scan the QR code on the table to reserve a course, but it can't be scanned at all. There is actually a timetable next to the check, but there is no one there.
Third, in addition to the peacocks in the garden cage, I also encountered 3 peacocks who were walking. I was a little flustered. I wonder if this is reasonable for stocking.
Fourth, the breakfast time set by the housekeeper is 8:30, which is very embarrassing for the morning time. In the end, I did not experience the equivalent of a health course at all.
Many other small issues, such as whether there should be free masks, the masks suddenly broke during a walk in the afternoon, and the restaurant does not have a gym on the top floor. The room card must be swiped for breakfast. My parents and seniors had to wait for me to go downstairs with the room card. There are no tableware and napkins at dinner, whether the wine and cakes on the table can be presented when they are introduced, and the lighting adjus**ent of the hotel room, etc.
ps, the food is good, but everyone on New Year's Eve should know it~
pps, also lost ten thousand pieces of ring, also really very depressed
~ It is not a resort hotel in general. If you don't take the course, it is not worth the price. Maybe you can see the "service" of the hotel at a different time.

msg:Let‚Äôs talk about the conclusion first: all the hotels in Shanghai are worth visiting, please be sure to participate in the workshop course, and the cheapest room type can also participate in the course.

Talking about the price, the basic big bed room with double breakfast and buffet dinner is less than 1800 on weekends, and the price is roughly the same as some luxury hotels indoors.

But Anandi has a lot of free courses to participate in, but because of the limited number of people, some bookings are late, and they say that they should check in a little earlier, and go to the WeChat applet to book the course as soon as they get the room number. To be able to participate in so many experience classes, I think it is worth the ticket price.

Room facilities: The most basic big-bed room is very good. There are all kinds of snacks, all kinds of equipment are complete, the mini bar also has some free drinks, there is also an oversized round bathtub, and it is also equipped with a traditional Chinese medicine bath package. There are 15 different pillows to choose from at night, as well as a blood pressure monitor... There are many things you can experience.

Service: Do you have a butler? I came to contact the day before check-in, but I made a phone call to confirm the time and so on. There is a housekeeper line in the room, which basically can meet the needs, and there is no special service, but you basically have corresponding needs.

Transportation: Are you on vacation? Still want to take the bus? (dog head) I just took the subway to Songhong Road, and then took a taxi... For the resort hotel, I really can't blame it... I don't have a car...

The following disadvantages! ! !

The check-in link is their characteristic, and they also fill out the questionnaire and do aura detection. There are many links, which are very interesting... But there are many links, so the waiting time in front of the queue is very long... The most annoying It will be very distressing if your class will be delayed. I hope there will be many counters to handle check-in during peak hours...

Buffet dinner: very average...even general deviation, if I hadn't stayed in this hotel, I would not have gone to the second time...First of all, I don't feel that much, there are not many varieties at each stall, and some are freshly made , Similar to hairy crabs, steaks, lamb chops, etc., it takes a long time to wait, and the most important thing is that the taste is very poor... It doesn't match the difference of its hotel level... A bit of a self-service feeling in the early 100s in the urban area. Then in the seafood area, for the first time, I had to wait in line to cut sashimi. Regardless of the quality of the sashimi, the sashimi still had to be cut in a queue, which was also very slow. I went past 6:30 to queue at 7:00 Before the line was reached, the salmon and arctic shellfish were gone! ? Although these two are not very good, they are better than Xilin Yuba. The quality of the sashimi is also very average. The evaluation is similar to the self-service buffet in the early 100s in the city... There are freshly opened oyster sashimi, but it is small and tastes a little fishy. , but it's ok, there are crab legs, but you need to squat, and it's gone when you come out, not much. Buffet dinner, all I can say is, if it wasn't for the set menu, I wouldn't eat it...

Some small problems, I mentioned before that there are 15 pillows to choose from at night, but none of the two I chose...emmm, I don't care about the big night, after all, there are 3 different sizes and thicknesses of soft and hard on the bed. of pillows.


Advantages, there are many advantages, the following are some particularly excellent. The experience is very good. From check-in to various supporting services, there is a feeling of recuperating and vacationing in Southeast Asia; some of the workshop classes are foreign teachers, and I feel that they value this experience, and there are also workshop classes specially designed for children; the room feels very good, I have stayed in many 5-star, or executive suites, etc. Although this basic room type is not the largest, it must be the most attentive; although the buffet dinner is very general, the breakfast is still very good, the variety is very rich, and it is better than the average hotel; free courses There are many, and you can enjoy it at the lowest price.

Summary: A resort hotel suitable for all ages, if you don't want to go to Shanghai for a short trip, this can be an essential option, and the same is true near Shanghai, but if you want to travel to Shanghai, please don't choose it.

The service is very considerate in all aspects, because it features a health hotel. From the beginning of check-in, there are various physical fitness tests, bracelets, and singing bowl welcome ceremonies. . . After entering the room, there will be health tea and welcome snacks. The waiters are basically responsive and polite.
Each person can participate in four courses for free, which is basically endless, and there is not so much time to go. Chose the singing bowl class, yin yoga and tai chi. Singing bowl class and comfortable, it is easy to fall asleep listening to the surrounding sound of bowlsüí§ But because of this, it is strongly recommended that the sessions are divided into men and women. In the session I attended, several men fell asleep, and the snoring was one after another. Horrible, it affects the experience too much üò±The yoga class is an Indian instructor, very nice. Tai Chi is also good, there are real exercises.
Finally, let‚Äôs talk about the hardware. The location is really bad, but I don‚Äôt really mind. In fact, the whole hotel is not big, and the place where peacocks are raised is outdoors. The upgraded Heyue room, the bathroom is spacious but the room is slightly cramped. The night before, I was too tired to eat breakfast. My husband said that the hotel breakfast was not bad. Overall quite satisfied.

Curtain shades are automatic and the drapes need to be manual a bit awkward. Not used to aromatherapy essential oils. Participated in two courses, singing bowl and tai chi, which were generally good. The butler service needs to be improved, and the reserved course only received the first reminder. The turndown is also late, but the service staff encountered are very polite. Great breakfast. All in all a good experience. Dinner was too late, so I didn't go to the hot spring spa, hoping to build a heated swimming pool instead of just thinking about the so-called hot springs that are sold to guests for a fee or packaged for price increases.

msg:It's finally time to **** Anadi.
One day in advance, Anandi's customer service contacted me to see if there were any details such as children and the elderly, and also helped with the license plates reported in advance.
Because I am a member of Ctrip, I can check in early (because of the epidemic, there are many people checking in during the normal check-in time of the hotel on that day). The staff who check in are very enthusiastic and will help with luggage. There is also a special housekeeper on the floor. Service, help to introduce various courses in the room, help to make reservations, help to introduce the equipment of the room.
Experienced a variety of courses on the day, so the entire stay was filled. You can also relax.
The buffet breakfast on the second day has a lot of choices, but you must order a little early, otherwise you will have to queue. It will also provide you with special vegetable juices according to your physique, which are also very delicious.
The whole stay was very comfortable. I liked the smell of the essential oils used in the hotel, and I slept very well. The hotel also provided a medicine bag for taking a bath, taking a bath, accompanied by the essential oil for deep sleep, and it was rare to have a good night's sleep.
This experience, except for the large number of people, was very good! If you can't go out to Shanghai, you can also take a big vacation here and relax.

The package includes hot springs, there are a little more people, I can understand it on weekends, fruit drinks can be eaten, and the quality of conscience, except for the children's paradise can be optimized, the rest is already very high, especially the service is OK ~ the toilet is a bit dirty, but if you talk more, get a temporary worker should be able to solve. 3.

It will be a second visit, and I hope that next time I can order it with my family. Of course, it was originally a business hotel, and it is understandable that it was forced to transform due to the epidemic. There are still 2 years of the epidemic, Shanghai hotels have the opportunity to transform into Internet celebrities, and the hot springs will get more traffic. I think this hotel will have a place!

My daughter took a bath for 20 minutes, and the water flooded from the shower room to the whole bathroom, so that the little girl came out of the shower and stood in the pond with bare feet calling for help. The girl forgot to take a change of clothes again, and was about to blame her. Standing at the door of the bathroom, I was also stunned by the water on the floor. The floor towel and slippers were soaked in the water. It was a mess... I quickly got my daughter out. , In the face of such a situation, I seriously doubt that this is a 5-star hotel! ? In just 20 minutes, how come the mountains are flooded with water? It was already 22:30 at that time. I quickly called the so-called housekeeper for repairs. Two groups of people came before and after, a plumber and a cleaning aunt. It was past 23:00 after the repair was completed. I haven't heard the so-called housekeeper come to care, is it repaired? Was there any interruption to rest etc, let alone an apology, really disappointed! How can such facilities and services deserve 5 stars? !

I came with the elderly and children, and I feel that this hotel is more suitable for the elderly to self-cultivate. Check-in has a physical examination, and then according to each person's own characteristics, you will be allocated special hot tea and drinks.
The room is very big and comfortable. It's a pity that the weather is too cold to experience the soup on the balcony. It would be better if the weather was warmer.
The food in the restaurant is not bad, and the buffet is also quite satisfactory.
The hotel staff are very friendly and the favorability is +1.
The spare parts are Yue Bi Shi is really a must-have!

Finally come to experience
The location of the hotel is a bit off, there is a skate park nearby
The room is not big, the facilities and equipment are average, not too bright
Mini bar drinks are free, the balcony is longer but not wide enough
Service is a plus
There are also people who will introduce rooms and courses
Have a snack before going to bed and wake up with ginger tea
The buffet is also commendable. The Chinese restaurant tastes very good.
Attended a workshop course, Singing Bowl Sound Therapy, and it was very relaxing and healing
The ceiling of the Shanghai Health Hotel is well deserved

2. The room booked in advance still needs to wait when it arrives. Check in was very slow. Wait more than half an hour.
3. Staying in this hotel for the third time, I feel that the service is getting more and more inconsiderate. There is no feeling at all when it opened for the first time. It should be the last time to stay, and I won't recommend it to friends.
4. Spa massage is stylized. If the requirements for strength and techniques are high, it is not recommended here.
4. The breakfast is crowded.

Parent-child yoga has made a certain child happy for a long time.
The Singing Bowl Healing Course is very good, like the ethereal sound from the vast universe, you can pursue the stillness of the mind and feel the energy of yourself (if there is no purring from those men, maybe I can fall asleep)
The housekeeper Winter contacted us one day in advance to inquire about the needs and make arrangements in time. After checking in that day, he was very enthusiastic about the introduction of the hotel, and I liked it.
The hotel buffet, as always, is cost-effective, and the desserts are the best!

Every detail is to enjoy this stay. The warm service of the lady at the front desk was cured (the lady at the front desk with big eyes and petite figure) may be more appropriate to use sincerity. Because I was particularly curious about the fragrance and the pleasant smell in the lobby, I asked the little brother who brought us into the elevator. The nervous face and the serious answer are also super cute. Finally, I would like to thank Manager Albert for his thoughtful reception and surprises. He is the benchmark for Shanghai brand hotels and my favorite talents in my subjective heart. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is also one of the reasons why Anadi can do so well.

The introduction and introduction of facilities during check-in are much more detailed than before. This is worthy of praise. However, I overturned the car in other details: I participated in the bowl sound course and officially started at 16:00. The hotel stipulated that latecomers were not allowed to enter, so some unpunctual guests were not allowed to enter the venue after being late. I kept hearing them making loud noises outside the door, looking for various reasons to try to intimidate the waiter into the classroom. Of course, there is nothing wrong with the hotel's approach, and it is also to take care of the experience of punctual guests, but the noise has affected us who participated in the course, so can't these poor quality guests be taken away from the scene? Is it so difficult to find a place that does not affect the normal guest experience courses? I hope the hotel management can pay attention to it and improve it in the future.

In addition, we like the hotel courses very much, and there are very few teachers. After two classes, the body and mind have been relaxed.

‚ù§Ô∏èLocation: Hongqiao airport area, given that the hotel focuses on health care and healing, if it is only an experience, you can spend 1-2 nights in the hotel. If you need a period of healing, it is also suitable for 1-2 weeks.

‚ù§Ô∏èHotel environment: warm and comfortable, you can smell the healing aroma everywhere, it is a hotel where you can calm down when you enter. When the weather is good, the hotel will release peacocks for viewing, and the trees in the garden are also very stylish.

‚ù§Ô∏èRoom facilities: This time I stayed in the Ambassador Suite, 120 square meters. I like every detail of the cloakroom, bedroom, living room and balcony. The scenery outside the terrace is beautiful. The white European-style building of the second phase opposite, the swimming pool and the green lawn complement each other. I especially like the design of the toilet area. The glass door of the shower has perfectly transformed the space. The square bathtub is equipped with Chinese herbal medicine and salt, the toiletries are sweet citrus flavor, fully automatic toilet, and smart electronic scale. The room is also equipped with health-preserving equipment such as a sphygmomanometer, steam eye mask, and aromatherapy machine. Some drinks, imported mineral water, some nuts and chocolates in the minibar are free. The suite enjoys Executive Lounge trea**ent, free afternoon tea and Happy Hour.

‚ù§Ô∏èHotel activities: The hotel provides a series of courses around the theme of health, such as yoga, meditation, singing bowl sound therapy, etc.

‚ù§Ô∏èService: A gas field test and questionnaire will be conducted for everyone when checking in. The suite will be checked in at the executive lounge on the 10th floor. The butler will wait on the check-in floor and will roughly analyze the gas field for you and introduce the facilities in the room in detail. (Guests staying in the suite can make an appoin**ent with an expert to conduct a more detailed analysis of the aura for you one-on-one). The hotel tailors body-building tea according to the physical condition tested by each person. The catering area on each floor can be refilled, and exclusive nutritional snacks are provided at night, and the wake-up tea is also delivered to the door in the morning.

‚ù§Ô∏èRestaurant: The hotel has 3 restaurants, Chinese restaurant, Western restaurant and Japanese restaurant, all taste great. The hotel‚Äôs buffet breakfast is very rich. I especially like freshly cooked meatball soup, noodles, braised quail eggs, fried lotus root cakes, radish crisps, barbecued pork crisps, various desserts, Yakult, coffee, etc. Everyone can receive exclusive nutritious fruit and vegetable juice according to the bracelet they wear.

msg:The annual holiday trip for girlfriends at the end of the year, due to the epidemic, decided to change to Magic City Hotel üè®Weekend tour~ It is the birthday of girlfriends, so the choice of hotel is to choose one after another. It must have a good environment, good service, and good food. A hundred things are good üòú!

In the end, we chose the highly rated Shanghai Anadi Hotel. Sure enough, our choice was correct. The hotel‚Äôs warm and thoughtful service, quiet and comfortable environment, patient and meticulous explanations, and rich and delicious dining have left us a deep impression. impression!

Especially our exclusive housekeeper Jenny, who contacted me by phone the day before we checked in, and asked us about the transportation method to the hotel in order to arrange parking, and whether we need to arrange early check-in when we arrive at the hotel, whether there are children, and whether It's birthdays, anniversaries, etc... It's really dripping, thoughtful! When I learned that it was my best friend's birthday, I didn't arrange a birthday cake, room layout, and upgraded the room type for us. I was pleasantly surprised and moved! If you have any questions during the stay, we will reply to you in time on WeChat, and like Jenny üëçüèª!

The Anadi Hotel in Shanghai is a hotel that focuses on health care. When checking in, it will conduct tests and questionnaires. The health tea is tailored according to the customer‚Äôs physical condition. A variety of snacks and various beverages are prepared in the room, both at night and in the morning. Dim sum and morning tea will be arranged~

The buffet in the evening and the breakfast the next day are very delicious. The combination of Chinese and Western, the variety and taste are also great! For dinner, there is actually freshly cooked seafood porridge. All seafood is fresh and cooked to order. In the cold winter, come to a bowl, warm your heart and stomach, it‚Äôs great!

The hotel also provides a variety of fitness courses for guests, such as yoga, meditation, and even yoga for children. Unfortunately, we did not experience it for those who love to sleep... We must not miss it next time!

When checking out, the staff asked about the check-in experience and gave perfume as a thank you gift for staying üéÅ. I just said casually that the air conditioner in the room lost heat at night, and I didn't care at all. It didn't take long for the housekeeping manager to add me to WeChat to apologize. It is really the small details that reveal the hotel's super sense of service!

The experience of staying here is very good, I am looking forward to staying with my family again next time

The hotels that have been in the collection for a long time, only to know that the original and Puli, Capella are all under the banner of a hotel group (alliance).

Location traffic:
Although it is near the airport, it is still 6 kilometers away from Hongqiao Station. It is a really quiet place with a good environment. It looks very clean and clean.

service:
The service is excellent, and the attitude of the young lady is very good. As soon as I came in to see that I booked the executive room, I took it to the executive front desk on the 10th floor to handle it. There was also a bowl experience, relaxing and feeling very good.

Room view:
The view is good, there is also a terrace, the lighting is good, and the privacy is very strong.

health:
Very clean and very comfortable.

bed:
There are three kinds of pillows, and other types of pillows are also provided, which are very comfortable; the mattress support is also great, so I don't want to wake up all the time.

breakfast:
It's quite hearty, but there is no egg benedict; the egg rolls are pretty good, the noodles are also pretty good, and overall it's not bad.

wifi:
The speed is okay, but the magic is that the password is the room number, usually the last name of the guest.

Room facilities:
The room is very large, and the health care facilities are particularly complete; the large bathtub can be used for medicinal baths, which is very comfortable and relaxing; the electric toilet is convenient to use; the shower flow is average, the water flow is the largest, and it is a little sideways, not very easy to use; the balcony is very nice, very It's comfortable, but Shanghai is still a bit hot these days, so I can't enjoy the cool outside.

It‚Äôs a really relaxing and comfortable hotel. There is Yin Yoga at 20:00-21:00 in the evening, and Sunrise Yoga at 8:00-9:00 in the morning. It is very suitable for relaxing on weekends, and the service is excellent. Especially good, Ba Shi is very good~

The breakfast buffet has a higher configuration and ice American style. There are not so many five-star breakfast buffets in Shanghai, but Anadi did it. The foreigner who led us in and I have been communicating, patiently helping me find a place, which makes people feel very familiar.

Personal feelings:
-Check-in is very ceremonial.
-Room service quality and timeliness are ok, with complete supporting facilities, and 15 pillows to choose from. (One of the major pain points of parent-child staying is that the air conditioner cannot be turned on too cold, because children must be taken into account, so the quilt of adults will be too hot. Most hotels do not pay much attention to the issue of thin quilts, and the texture of thin quilts will be poor A lot, not thin enough. There is room for improvement here.)
-The restaurant is well managed, and the taste of the food is unparalleled. (It‚Äôs a pity that I didn‚Äôt make a reservation for the dinner buffet. The tea restaurant tastes good!)
-The swimming pool is on the top floor and is semi-indoor. The gym equipment next to it is quite complete.
-Executive rooms can enjoy a happy hour on the 10th floor (18.00-20.30). Fruit fresh
The process of leaving the store was also very warm, especially the manager Li Bo felt the strong warmth for our whole family!

The service includes every courteous staff and jenny the housekeeper. Jenny helped me make reservations for all meals and spas, as well as courses. WeChat will always reply to all my questions in time. After checking out, contact me and arrange express delivery for missing items. Thanks Up~
All employees have a strong sense of active service, and only such a sense of service can better convey the hotel's concept and service sop.
The most favorite of the course is the morning energy breathing + meditation and the afternoon gong bath (song bowl). The thermos cup contains tea suitable for the human body. You can refill tea in many places in the hotel, as well as wake up tea in the morning and snacks in the evening.
The western food buffet is good~the Japanese restaurant is ordinary~the Chinese restaurant did not try it. The spa techniques and essential oils are good~
Next time I need deep relaxation and energy, I will choose Anadi~ The non-holiday experience should be better~

msg:In the first-tier hotels I have stayed in since the epidemic, the comprehensive ranking is in the top five (with Suning Baolijia, Shenkeng, and Wenhua excluding 58 steakhouses, they are comparable to each other, and a bit better than Heping Hotel. W Hotel, Pudong Shangri-La is much better), the overall feeling is great.
        Environment: bright and clean modern style, crowded without interference, except for the restaurant and check-in area, other places are very clean (even the class is quiet)
        Service: First check your physical fitness when staying in a health-care-themed hotel. Our family has just measured three different types: water, fire, and wind. The health-care tea, evening snacks, and breakfast vegetable juices we drink afterwards are all delivered according to physical fitness. The mint green bracelet that was allotted greatly satisfies the little girl's preferences. The next day, it was specially used for hair curling. It was true love. The color of the thermos for drinking tea is the same as the bracelet, which is really nice detail. The front desk and room service are very good, I can feel their love for work, and explain in a joyful tone instead of routinely walking through the scene. In order to select courses, I have called several butler hotlines and arranged the courses I like. I am satisfied. The child liked the Winnie the Pooh biscuits presented at check-in. We encouraged her to pick it up by herself. The customer service in the check-in area gave two packs at once, and she was very happy.
        Facilities: very comfortable. Eye masks, Chinese herbal bath bags, and bath salts were placed in the room. When I returned to the room at night, the housekeeper had already ordered essential oils, which was lightly refreshing. We also chose three different pillows according to the pillow menu, which was full of holiday feeling and found it very interesting. There are two sets of bath products, and the unpriced beverages in the refrigerator‚ÄîBeer, Yiquan, Coke, Sprite, are all available, which are more generous than most hotels.
Courses and Spa: the items included in the package, experience the aroma oil spa, gong bath course, aroma healing course, much better than expected, it is exactly the level of the fee-based class, the teachers and spa service staff in the class are all Seriously, not at all perfunctory.
        Restaurant: I used the buffet dinner and breakfast in the restaurant, and I think there are a lot of slots. The dinner buffet cost more than 400, and the food is similar to that of any company with a level of more than 200 yuan. The key management is really bad. It is the first time that I have a buffet. I didn‚Äôt understand the shark fin soup stall so I arranged a service staff to work slowly. The line was so long that no management staff thought of adjusting. If the manpower is not enough, an assistant will help to arrange the plate during peak hours. Just serve the soup and put in various side dishes one by one, or use the table number to sign the meal like Shangri-La to arrange the meals that need to be waited for. Barbecue steak and lamb chops are also available at the same stall. The 3 or 5 people in front of other houses will only wait for 3 or 5 minutes, and here they must wait for more than 10 minutes. The management staff may have ignored the queuing, but this really affected the dining experience. In addition, hairy crabs and wave dragons were originally distributed by the service staff at each table. Anyway, when we sat down to dine, we asked to line up by ourselves. Then I saw that the other tables were delivered to the table and asked the service staff in skirt suits. I was surprised to say that they were all delivered without waiting in line, but I asked again, I still said that I had to line up to collect... How messy is this training and management to require diners to repeatedly confirm such a simple point? At least three times I got the message that I had to line up to pick it up (there are indeed hairy crabs that need to be picked up, but the guests will always eat the ones included in the meal fee), and finally it came (just after a long time) , And one person was missed when it was served, and it took a long time to make up).
        The dinner cake is delicious, but this restaurant is not recommended at all. There are better choices for more than 200, not to mention more than 400 here.
        The breakfast food is the same as most hotels, the small wontons are delicious, and the snacks are not repeated in the evening, and they are also delicious. But in the short meal time, I felt the low-level service again, no one asked if coffee is needed (the coffee is worthy of lavender), there is no sugar packet after the coffee, and there is no stir stick after the sugar packet. ...... The fruit and vegetable juice pick-up stick that should be delivered when entering the restaurant did not give me Lg (the restaurant where he and I entered twice).
        Restaurant management is the only deduction point for this hotel, but the waiters in the restaurant are at least serving (although there is no smile and two styles in other areas), but they have not received the corresponding training and the management staff to remind them of the appropriate details, so they still give The restaurant scored 3 points, and try not to choose the set menu with buffet dinner next time. Room service can be scored 7 points (out of 5 points), the two offset the hotel is still full points.
        In general, it is still a hotel that will choose the second brush, especially this time my mother has arranged other activities in advance and did not come. I will come again next time if I have the opportunity.

As soon as I entered the hotel on the check-in day, Jenny‚Äôs one-stop service was ushered in. The singing bowl ceremony made us feel the soul Shocked, according to the physical test results of the stay, we will prepare juices and prepared foods of corresponding colors for you. The executive room is spacious and enjoys the outdoor bathing pool dispensing package. The presented afternoon tea is of good value and taste. The hotel is careful. I have booked two different room types, two housekeepers, one is the housekeeper Ms. Jenny Chen Li‚Äôs one-stop caring and heart-warming service, I look forward to the next service from Jenny, and there is also a butler who looks like Fei Yuqing‚Äôs younger brother. Peter Huang Changping also has a deep impression. After living in Anadi, he has become more peaceful with Buddhism. I look forward to the next time!

The room comes with a big bubble pool, but the baby feels a bit cold in this weather, so it's better to bubble in the big bathtub. Bath salts and traditional Chinese medicine bath bags are readily available. The room comes with afternoon tea in the room, there are many varieties, and the child said that it is too comfortable to eat after swimming. The swimming pool is very friendly to children who have just learned to swim. It is 14 meters long and 1.3 meters deep. There are also several shallow paddling pools for children to play.

The second thing that made people very angry, because the baby fell asleep and friends came to chat with us, we took our friends to sit in the sofa area in the lobby (next to the lobby bar) We wanted to order a drink, but the bar was already It was closed, so I called the waiter to ask if we could order, and the waiter gave us the menu/wine list. Suddenly, a man who claimed to be the manager came and told us that we could not sit here. I would like to ask where there is a hotel Must the guests return to the room? Is your hotel in North Korea? We thought it was strange, so we asked where the lobby manager was? He said: Here I am the biggest!

This person is called Tailor Zhao!

The worst thing is, he said, well, you can sit here, but don't sleep there! My goodness! Really embarrassed in front of friends, do we look like people who would sleep in a hotel lobby? Do your guests have to quarrel with their husbands or wives and have to come down to the lobby and be driven back to their rooms?

I have stayed in hotels all over the world, and I have never seen you so bad! I checked the name of the legal person in the hotel, and it was Zhao. It is estimated that there is someone behind the manager who dares to speak so loudly?

Because the industry I was in charge of before has more contact with the hotel industry, this hotel is a healing and decompression for busy urbanites, and I have to say that there is still a valuable place in Shanghai, which is full of hotels.
1. Sensory experience. As soon as you enter the hotel, you will have the smell of essential oils to soothe your emotions and relieve stress. There is a lot of blank space in the room, people-oriented.
2. Service. There will be an Ayurvedic physical test during check-in, and teas suitable for the guest‚Äôs system will be recommended to be placed in a vacuum flask for unlimited refills. Turndown service provides 15 pillow menus and eye masks. Each room has an exclusive butler who reminds guests to slow down when checking in. Room background music and aromatherapy can relax guests and soothe their emotions. Practice clothes and yoga mats are all available in each room, as well as detox meals. Yvonne on the executive floor is attentive and enthusiastic.
3. Course learning. Yinbo healing, yoga classes, meditations, etc., class hours are arranged throughout the day. Body and mind are relaxed.

Was rolled into the gentle breeze
In the soft clouds
And in the orange-flavored hug
First of all, as a healing hotel, Anadi will always belong to his own set of audio ‚ûï fragrance chakra therapy.
The refreshing citrus aroma essential oils are paired with the purifying sound from nature, the bath and herbal medicine packs of Chinese medicine are provided, giving the tired body and mind a journey of harmony between man and nature.
The hotel‚Äôs internal and external layouts are all well-designed, and the river is surrounded by affection, making me feel at home! These days, I have caused trouble to my housekeeper, Chen Li, Jenny. Although there was a little unpleasantness in booking a course (the children could not participate in the course), Jenny did not ignore the children's user experience because of their young age. Immediately bring a small gift to appease the unhappiness of the young guests. It really makes every guest feel the sincerity that Anadi brings us!
The warm color light and the design concept of returning to the yuan in the hotel embodies sitting and walking in meditation, a flower and a world, and a leaf and a bodhi.
After returning from the healing journey, I would like to continue our relationship with Anadi.

See the world with a pure heart, live life with joy
Bring affection with a normal heart, and remove obstacles with a soft heart

Before check-in, there were four communications regarding the upgrade of Yuanzhou Platinum Card and LHW membership. In one of them, Ctrip customer service clearly answered Ctrip's order when asking for help, and at the same time enjoyed Yuanzhou Platinum Card room upgrade and lounge trea**ent (Ctrip has left a recording Voucher), at the same time, I also said that I can enjoy it when I confirm it by phone, but I confirmed with the housekeeper before moving in and found that the owner's Yuanzhou Platinum Card is not applicable at all, I strongly question the professionalism of the service, and I don't want to tear this trea**ent and upgrade to affect my mood. In addition, try to arrange a room with a better view facing the opposite building, and you can see it clearly, and the actual measurement of the executive suite is no different from a friend's non-suite room type (it's just a fake room, mind lightning protection). 2: The breakfast is very chaotic. The so-called customized drinks in the propaganda all depend on reaching out, and no one comes to deliver it at all. 3: The noise in the executive lounge is hell level. I don't understand why a group of human cubs are running around and making a fuss without anyone to stop them? ? Very puzzled! Isn't the executive lounge a place for business guests from the beginning? Not to mention the dress code required by the American Lounge, the children here are running around and screaming, I really don't know how to manage it. 4: All kinds of rights and interests depend on reaching out. The laundry allowance of 100 yuan for suite guests written in black and white on the book in the room is clear to the switchboard alone in the hotel? ? ? When I checked out, I had to catch the high-speed train, and it was unclear from the three people at the front desk to the contact the reservation depar**ent (the service training was extremely inadequate, whether it was membership status or various facilities). Terrible experience, from membership benefits to room arrangement to lounge to quality of service. Seriously bad review. As a hotel blogger, I have stayed in nearly ten LHW hotels in China, and this one can be said to be far below the other standards, let alone compare it with Capella or Qishang. Compared to a real international chain, even the average Marriott Hyatt, such a service is very disappointing and disappointing.

msg:Booked an executive Hengyue bubble pool room through Ctrip. To be honest, the experience of staying in is extremely poor! Rubbish hotel, I hope everyone will pay attention!

I read the reviews before and said that the service is very good. When I checked in, the housekeeper took me to introduce the various facilities of the room in detail. Didn't I live in the same hotel as they? Knowing that I took a child, I gave it to the worst room (room 352) from 6 o'clock to 9 o'clock in the evening. A large group of people were practicing yoga at the door of the room (picture 4), and the nearest room was not close to the door. 2 meters, the door opened at 8:30 the next morning, and someone started practicing again (Picture 5)

When booking with Ctrip, there is a free afternoon tea in the room. When the child was about to eat one of the desserts, passion fruit pudding, he noticed that there was a black bug on the surface (pictures 1 and 2) and notified the hotel. A person who claimed to be a customer relationship manager came to apologize verbally and took a photo. The solution was Change one and give a small fruit plate! I am quite shocked by the emergence of this situation. In this extraordinary period of the epidemic, the hotel should have taken care of all directly imported foods, but the food quality control of this so-called high-end health and wellness hotel is quite worrying!

Since the hotel promotion is focused on health preservation, whether it is a gimmick or not, I believe you, but what does your waiter mean by pressing the room doorbell at 22:35 in the evening (check and monitoring)? I had already fallen asleep and thought something urgent had happened. After opening the door, I said it was a cup of health tea. I didn't hold back the swearing at the time. I came here so late to disturb my rest, just to send a cup of health tea?

There is also the so-called executive lounge. A few drinks were removed at 7:20 in the evening, but there was nothing. I asked the waiter, and even replied that they would be refilled at 8 in the evening.

Finally, I added that I don‚Äôt need the cold storage box and medicines that were lost in the freezer in the room (the hotel did not notify me that there are items in the freezer), and it has been 4 days since I checked out, and the deposit has not been returned.

Rubbish hotel, I hope everyone will pay attention!

The manager held a check-in ceremony for us and asked me to close my eyes and listen to the sound of beating, as if I had heard a distant call.

It should be said that the first thing is that the next time you stay at the hotel will take at least two nights before you can feel completely relaxed, instead of being in a hurry.
‚òÜFrom the beginning of check-in, there is a very meticulous and considerate service, and then when you arrive in the room, you will feel sleepy instantly. With the welcome video and music on the TV in the room, it is very relaxing. (May be related to the essential oil diffuser stone that permeates the entire hotel)
‚òÜThere are so many things to eat, from the lounge where you stay, the three-tier afternoon tea of the set menu, and detox meals to all kinds of dried fruits and soft drinks that you have in the room. To eat, or to do yoga, that's a question.
‚òÜThe rich experience of yoga, meditation, and singing bowls is not boring at all. The hotel has created people who want to be soft in the room, but they also want to sign up for a format course, which is very entangled.

Satisfying the expectations of the spa, the attitude of the staff is okay, and I am going to do water yoga, but as soon as I enter the room, the smell of feet is full. . It's unforgettable. . This made me unable to participate in any other group activities in the hotel, I really don't know how well the sanitation is done.
The second is that there is no water in the room. The trustee called for water. After calling for more than an hour, he went out and the water did not come. .
The butler's check-in and check-out skip-the-line service can only be considered in the entire check-in process considering the guests' feelings.
In short, it is understandable that there are many people during the Spring Festival, and the service pressure is high. But a five-star hotel should have the service standard of a five-star hotel, which is really disappointing.

msg:Anadi, health hotel, I finally came.
I have been hesitating, and there are no interesting hotels around. When the epidemic is not out of Shanghai, I will check in for a day of self-cultivation.
The surrounding area of the hotel is not foreign enough, and there are many green plants. The security guard at the door was very enthusiastic and led me all the way to the lobby.
The style and fragrance of a five-star hotel. A foreign female received me. To be honest, I didn't think foreign waiters had any special advantages. On the contrary, some language communication inconveniences still exist. Physical fitness test, check a few multiple-choice questions, wear a personality bracelet, knock on the back of the forehead, hehe, moved in.
Before I checked in, the hotel called me to ask about my specific name, but when I checked in, it was a typo. I didn‚Äôt change my ID card. Well, the TV in the room keeps scrolling and repeating the wrong name.
The butler Ava is very cute. Although the physique water was sent to the wrong place, he was very patient to book the experience course for me.
The rooms are very clean and equipped. The bed was very comfortable and I slept till dawn.
The singing bowl class experience is good, the sound of bowling and music can really fall asleep. Relaxation, nourishment, suitable for men and women of all ages.
For yoga class, the teacher speaks Indian English with some Chinese characters. The movements are not difficult, but don‚Äôt force it without any basic advice. Of course, there is also a little girl who has practiced dance, Versailles.
The secret buffet at night is really so-so. Expect too much for it, black pepper prawns, pickles and spicy pork bran noodles are okay.
For breakfast the next day, I had a bowl of pickles and spicy pork bran noodles.
Time flies quickly. Although platinum members can check out late, I checked out at standard time. I just want to go back to the city center.
Good experience, good value for money hotel. The waiter is polite and enthusiastic, the sound of the bowl in the ear, the thermos cup that I took...

The buffet is varied and delicious. Soak in a medicated bath before going to bed, very comfortable. Will stay next time.

msg:The epidemic is serious and I dare not go to other places. It is said to be a high-end spa hotel. Ctrip booking package includes breakfast, room fee and single spa
The first thing to enter the hotel is the fragrant orange flavor. The hotel facilities are basically available.
Except for some check-in ceremonies, etc., they all have more feelings
I feel that the service of the entire hotel is very good, and many requirements will be met
Participated in the Singing Bowl Workshop on that day, it was very nice, there were snacks in the room
Stayed on the next day. There are many types of breakfast, which is good.

A few minor issues: I often can‚Äôt open the door with my renewed room card. I keep going to the front desk to swipe my card.
The morning tea for the second night was not provided.
Some waiters in the restaurant are not familiar with hotel facilities and supporting services. They only seem to say that I don‚Äôt know this.

When you check in, you need to fill out a form to determine what physique you are. People of different physiques will get thermos bottles with different health teas.
There are many different courses in a day, such as yoga, meditation, etc.
The restaurant in the hotel feels average, a bit expensive and the food is relatively ordinary, and the breakfast is ok.

msg:I came here admiringly. After I lived, I felt that I was under the prestige, but it was actually difficult.
The hotel environment and guest room facilities are still up to standard, with a variety of internet celebrity angles and a refreshing and comfortable feeling.
Hotel services: After three episodes, let‚Äôs not say that health preservation is simply a mess üßê 1. The housekeeper calls to ask about personalized needs before check-in, and Ctrip also calls to introduce the hotel‚Äôs response. The suites all have balconies and are on floors 9-10. So, stay at ease and happily. It turned out that there was no balcony after check-in, so I proposed to change the room, and it was also arranged. After the change, it was found that the welcome gift and activity table of the original room did not come, and some small defects did not affect us.
2. After dinner, I went back to my room and found that I asked for a quilt. It was a blanket, and it was a bit smelly, and it was not suitable for sleeping. I called the customer service to ask for a quilt, but I was told that there were no quilts in the room. I was helpless to accept it at this time. I asked if You can come with a quilt cover, anyway, as long as it can be covered in hot weather, the customer service answered: Our quilt and quilt cover are matched, and there is no extra to provide.
3. When I went to the executive lounge before going to bed, I wanted to drink milk with a few biscuits for the children, but I was told that there was none. I asked for a few dollars for the children. The service staff said to look for it, but there was no answer. Until you consciously left, no service staff came to give you the result.
In the end, all three episodes were resolved and nothing was resolved. Regarding the quilt, it was delivered with insistence. Is it necessary to make trouble to provide services? Regarding the executive lounge, I received a call at around 10:30 the next day, saying that I would send an apology snack, am I short of heart, or do you lack the sense of service? I hope your service can also start from the heart

msg:A very bad experience
1. Inject the registration chaos, many people are disorderly, there is no queue at all, the so-called health test is to give you a bracelet, a cup of sweet mixed juice at breakfast, and a cup of tea in the room ‚ûï the next morning A cup of tea, you know the taste for yourself, I can‚Äôt drink it anyway. The housekeeper delivered tea once when he entered the room and never saw it again.
2. This stay is actually aimed at the theme of health preservation, and there is also a singing bowl course. Let‚Äôs talk about health preservation. The ad copy I have seen before are all years of quiet and good, but the reality is all kinds of commercial activities. There may be many weekend activities, and it is unimaginable noisy. It seems that the hotel also undertakes photography business, and you can see all kinds of places everywhere. Shoot, still keep in good health? I just want to go back to the room and be quiet, but the soundproofing of the room is not flattering. People passing by in the corridor early in the morning can hear clearly.
3. On the day of check-in, I made an appointment for the singing bowl at 16:00. I adjusted the alarm clock and took a nap and got ready to go. When the LG1 elevator came out without a trace of directions, I finally asked a staff member to ask where the course is. It may be on the third floor. Finally, surrounded by ladies in various dresses, I found the course classroom at 16:00, but the door was closed, and there were estimated to be 10 people arriving at the same time‚ûï, basically they brought their parents to experience, and called the front desk. , Here comes a *** guy. First, he said that the course was cancelled. Then he said that you were late. At the end, I didn‚Äôt care about it. I said at the entrance of the hall next door, "We‚Äôre meeting. Please be quiet. Someone will be on the spot." This staff member said on the phone that there is a trouble here, Nani? ! Then I waited for the two staff members to come and ask us if we have a request. It was really dumbfounding! Wearing uniform workshop uniforms, we instantly became medical troubles, my God! After the operation, they went back to their rooms and waited for news. I didn‚Äôt call until dinner to say that I could add one at 20:00 (eyes rolled), forget it, let‚Äôs go to bed, I remembered it during dinner, but I didn‚Äôt even hear the sentence I‚Äôm sorry. Are you sure you are a five-star hotel? ?
4. The mattress and pillows are quite comfortable, and the bedside is dusty and wiped by yourself, and the aromatherapy essential oil is given, but the aromatherapy machine does not work normally. The bathroom is separated from wet and dry. There is no washlet, but there is a pp washing faucet next to it. Is it Southeast Asian style? I wanted to try it, but I didn't get a lot of water.
5. Dinner tastes average, this steak can't be cut even if it is really cut. In contrast, breakfast is slightly better.
I wanted to take my mother to relax before the typhoon came. Although the hotel was more than 2 kilometers away from home, we didn't have a class on the health tour at the end. We were sleeping all the time. Didn't we sleep well at home? The Novotel Kingboard room next door is not worse than yours. It's only 400+ nights. What kind of health gimmick you do will have a face multiplied by 4. Who gave you the courage? There are also all kinds of unwilling greetings, it is better not to say hello.

My housekeeper, Miss Kim, is very human and thoughtful, good! The buffet has many varieties and is delicious. Especially breakfast is good! I am in a particularly good mood. The only two points of advice: 1) When we checked in, we had to check in on the 10th floor. I felt that the signs on the first floor or the reception staff were still a bit lagging. It took some time and then went to the 10th floor to arrange check-in procedures; 2) The butler‚Äôs authority was too small , We want to extend the check-out to 12 o'clock, but the butler said that we still need to ask the front desk. I personally think that since there is a butler service, this authority should be given to the butler. Hehe!

This is a 3 days 2 nights staycation trip for me. Special kudos and sincere thanks to our butler, Eileen. for her patience and consistent help! She always responds to my small little random questions and requests for help via wechat very quickly.

We also love the excellent service rendered by all the hotel staff Ôºàall levelsÔºâ, feels sincere and "no push sales" at all. Special thanks to all the teachers at the complimentary workshops, like Lisa, Ashley and Mohit. Highly recommended for ones who want to chill and relax Ôºàno shoppingÔºâ and get some inner peace and rest! We really enjoy the stay and will look forward to another staycation at Anandi.
