msg:Such a nice place to go for weekend relaxation. We love the infinity pool and the cleanliness of the entire area. The food is good; if you want barbecue, be sure to order in advance or, better yet, bring your own meat. Unfortunately, we ordered, we waited, and then, after more than 30 minutes, they told us it wasn't available anymore. Also, it's so hard to take a taxi or Didi from there; we've asked the receptionist to help us, but she said they couldn't. We hope the receptionist can be more accommodating and helpful. Anyway,after an hour of waiting, we've got our own taxi without their help. But overall, we like staying there, and we will definitely come back for the infinity pool and nature.

msg:This is the hotel I must stay in every time I pass by Hefei with my furry kids. The rooms are spacious and comfortable, and the stay is leisurely and quiet. The sanitary conditions are also very good. In a small village in Hefei New District, there are many farmhouses and Xiaolingnan where you can let your children fly. If you are traveling with your family, you can live in a yard, which is quite comfortable! I think this price is quite worth it. I like the ambience of the hotel.

The front desk and housekeepers are very enthusiastic and proactive in greeting me. The lights are very beautiful at night. The B&Bs are mainly independent courtyards, distributed in endless fields. I will come back when I have time.

msg:The hotel is surrounded by large wheat fields, which is suitable for dogs to frolic in. The staff are also very friendly. Generally speaking, it is very suitable for a family weekend trip.

However, the hotel is not good enough in terms of barrier-free facilities. Many of them are steps, which makes it difficult to pass wheelchairs and strollers. I hope that the needs of these customers can also be paid attention to.

My friend came here overnight and didn’t take any pictures of the building. I went to take pictures, very suitable for punching cards, very nice. Recommended!

msg:I have to admit that the service attitude of the hotel is very good, the venue is large, and there are endless wheat fields everywhere. You can drive off-road vehicles and cartoon three-wheeled motorcycles. The children had a great time, and there will be concerts in the evening.
Only two shortcomings
1. The common problems of homestays are poor sanitation and dirty toilet seat. Fortunately, we have always had the habit of bringing our own disposable toilet seat
2. Press the safety exit sign on the top of the door frame, and you can’t close it when you sleep at night. The green light, with pictures, affects sleep very much, and it’s very scary. Picture 5 See it for yourself

The money-making part of this hotel is that if you can't get a taxi, I will drive you to your destination at a high price, and I will charge you a few hundred yuan for the toll. Formaldehyde The smell is super strong. You can’t order takeout nearby. There is nothing. It can be said that it is in the middle of nowhere.
