msg:The hotel service is so so, Not worth that price .the breakfast is kinda boring. Veggies turns yellow .The manager was trying to squeeze the last milk for child‚Äòs oatmealüòä 

Also pls don‚Äôt waste your hard earned money to hire the tour lady which hotel front desk recommended that cost you ¬•198 per person . She is separate from
Hotel, not good service at all . She just take you to gate of each activity place( Max 5 activities ) inside disneyland . and she not really help you us that much. The tour lady just walk you to the entrance of the each game then she left,she not help you queue in line for you , just wasted the money . Actually we can download a ShangHai Disney App and you can still can visit 7-10 activities or rides all day from 10am-9pm. and the Disney App gives  you right guidance ,waiting time , distance and direct you to arrive each activity conveniently .
By the way, the Disney App Will help you big time .
Have fun there .

Room wise the cleanliness could be slightly improved as the toilet was abit sandy. All other amenities is adequate, room is super spacious, bed is super comfy. Toiletries and sandals provided is of a very good standard. However one little qualm about the room would be the aircon, the room is not cold enough I feel and we found ourself sweating everytime we wake up. The aircon temperature adjust doesnt seems to be helping even after we changed it to the lowest temperature.

Hotel morning buffet has a wide selection and they all tasted good. One of the better hotel buffet that I've come across.

Free shuttle bus service provided to shanghai disneyland, this helped us to save alot time and made the process alot better in general.

Free shuttle bus to the airport needs to be arranged beforehand with the receptionist. 

Overall hassle free and very convenient if you are going to disneyland, will highly recommend this hotel for people heading to disneyland or the pudong airport.

My 4 years old daughter sleeping at the lobby and I can‚Äôt get the room. Front office claimed that they already contacted Ctrip and they will fix the issue, since they were fully book for my room type they upgraded me to the family room, I got my room key finally around 1 hour, the next day I approached counter to check my room status, the problem was not fixed yet. I contacted Ctrip and Ctrip claimed that was Hotel problem.  This is my first time used Ctrip and I was bad luck.

Finally both parties hotel and Ctrip solved my problem.

When we got off the car, the service staff took the initiative to open the door to help with the luggage and delivered it to the room.

The bathroom is bigger, there is a bathtub for bathing, the bedding is clean and hygienic, and the buffet breakfast is rich. For dinner, we went to the restaurant on the second floor of the hotel. It serves Shanghainese cuisine, which tastes good, but is a bit greasy for my personal taste, and it is an open kitchen. After eating in the restaurant, I was full of the smell of oil smoke, which is not good for my respiratory tract. I hope the hotel can improve.

Transportation: It is about 15 minutes by taxi from Disney, and you can also enjoy the hotel's free shuttle service. The airport is also about 15 minutes away.

msg:Booked a hotel to go to Disney. The two hotels in Disney are expensive, but this one is very cost-effective. There are Disney shuttle buses in the morning and evening. We bought Disney Early Bird Pass. We left at least at 6 o'clock and needed to take a taxi by ourselves. It was easy to get a taxi at 6 o'clock. We took the shuttle bus back at night. We couldn't catch breakfast, so the hotel packed it up. Bread, eggs, cucumbers, and a few slices of sausages should be given. We had breakfast at the hotel the next day. The variety was quite rich! The shower in the bathroom was not very good. The water flow was too strong and could not be fixed! Overall, the hotel is still highly recommended for the price of 700. The bed is big, suitable for 3 people, including breakfast, which tastes good! There were already a lot of people at the Disney gate at 6 o'clock in the morning on May 13!

msg:On May 1, I took my children to Shanghai Disneyland. I hope to find a hotel that is not too far from the park. I read it several times online and focused on everyone's comments. To be honest, some bad reviews of Wanxin Hotel made me feel uneasy even though I booked the hotel. It was not until I checked in that I found that the hotel was quite good. First of all, the front desk staff was very enthusiastic. Xiaowanzi at the front desk provided two free breakfast coupons for the children and took the initiative to ask if they needed to make an appoin**ent for the car to the park (I rented a car myself, so there was no need), but I still felt warm in my heart. When I came to the room, the hotel prepared welcome fruits and gave a small gift (a very exquisite cup), which exceeded my expectations. The room decoration is relatively new. I booked a deluxe king-size bed room with a bathtub, which the children love. There are several restaurants around the hotel, most of which are barbecues, but also noodles and stir-fried dishes, which are quite convenient. Finally, I want to tell you that the hotel's breakfast is quite rich. Thanks again to Xiaowanzi and other staff of the hotel.

The hotel shuttle was also very responsible, and it took about ten minutes to drive to Disneyland.
I also thank Ouyang and Guanguan for helping to book the shuttle and pack breakfast for the next day. In short, it is highly recommended to go to Disneyland, and the experience is better than the hotels in the city that cost one or two thousand yuan.

msg:I felt bad after staying for one night because I saw that it was booked with Ctrip's 5 bricks, but the actual living experience was only 3 bricks. Ctrip says it will be renovated in 2023, but it is actually renovated in 2016. It may simply be painted in 2023, but the facilities and environment still cannot keep up.
1. First of all, the place is not hygienic and cannot take a shower. When I first checked in, I found that the shower room was full of mud from the previous guest's bath! ! ! It was so thick that it was disgusting. Neither the cleaning nor the room manager even saw it! I originally planned to change hotels, but the surrounding five-star hotels were far away from the airport. Since I had to catch an early flight at 7 o'clock the next day, I thought I would forget it and just wash it off. Okay, I‚Äôm too lazy to say anything.
2. The second point is that the door of the shower room cannot be closed, and the water flows out when taking a shower. And the non-slip slippers of disposable slippers are not good, because the water flows out and the floor is very slippery. When I walked to the bathroom, I almost slipped. This is a serious safety hazard. It‚Äôs a problem. If I‚Äôm older, I feel like it‚Äôs easy for me to have problems.
3. The third is that the facilities are aging and the socket panels are all warped. This can be considered a newly renovated hotel in 2023. Did Ctrip‚Äôs inspection staff receive red envelopes? How can such a decoration be written as newly renovated in 2023? of!
4. What pissed me off the most was that there was a man on the premise who had a very bad service attitude. I ordered takeout when I was hungry at night and did not allow the delivery person to deliver it upstairs. I understand this, after all, it is for the safety of the guests, but you can not deliver it upstairs. Ah, they don‚Äôt deliver by hand, they say they will be delivered by robots, but there are too few robots and there are too many takeaways, so we have to wait for half an hour! Or get it yourself! At around 11 o'clock in the middle of the night, I took off my clothes and went to bed. The front desk also asked me to get takeout by myself. Is there such a hotel service?
In short, I will never stay in this hotel again. I can‚Äôt believe Ctrip‚Äôs rating. A hotel like this can actually get five bricks! ! ! Extremely speechless!

msg:It‚Äôs my first time to visit Shanghai Disney and my experience of staying in a Shanghai hotel. This hotel is really the worst and worst hotel I have stayed in in more than ten or twenty years!
1) When we first arrived at the hotel and registered at the front desk to get the room card, we were told that we did not want the first and last rooms. The person at the front desk said they were all rooms in the middle, but as soon as we got in, the room faced the elevator lobby! It turns out that this is how their rivals understand the concept! Gain wisdom!
2) We stayed for two nights and went out to play during the day. We were not sure about the air conditioner in the room. But when we returned to the room at night, the air conditioner was on but not on! It is said that the central air conditioner only adjusts heating! No refrigeration! The air conditioning temperature in the room has always been 28 degrees, and it went up to 29 degrees on the second night! But the air conditioners in the hotel lobby and floor corridors were extremely cold! That is, only employees can enjoy air conditioning! The guests only had the stuffy sauna and it was so hot that they couldn't sleep!
3) Call the front desk and housekeeping to make complaints, and their answers are even better! They all told us to turn off the air conditioner and sleep! good! Turn off the air conditioner, there is no air or air! Do you want to be bored?
4) Then we complained to the front desk and housekeeping, and they told us to open the window to sleep! Do you have to sleep with the windows open when staying in a hotel? Then this hotel room is worth more than 800 to 900 yuan a night! ?
5) Finally brought a hair dryer! But we are three adults and one child! One hair dryer was not enough and we asked them to bring another one. After a while, they came to tell us that all the hair dryers were given to guests and there was no more hair dryers! Then I want to ask, if your hotel spends all this money to buy so many hair dryers, why don‚Äôt you use that money to buy air conditioners? ? I don‚Äôt know how many people will check out immediately that night in the summer!
6) On the second night, it was so hot that I kept sweating even after taking off my clothes. How can I sleep? Is it only a hotel problem or a Shanghai policy problem that can only provide heating? Why can't every room be changed to allow guests to adjust the temperature themselves? You have to get central air conditioning!
7) There is no convulsions in the bathroom! It‚Äôs also boring as hell!
8) Later, I was given a small box of biscuits and a cup with a bear. What‚Äôs the point of giving these? ?
In the end, I can only say that I had a great time coming to Shanghai Disneyland, but my first experience at the Shanghai Hotel couldn‚Äôt be worse! This Shanghai hotel has been blacklisted! Anyone who sees it should avoid the trap! It‚Äôs simply spending money to buy discomfort!

msg:It was a relatively hurried trip, and the main destination was Disney. I looked at many hotels and this one was the closest hotel to the park with five stars. The main reasons for choosing this hotel are as follows: 1. The hotel was renovated in 2023, and the overall situation is pretty good, with satisfactory hygiene, facilities, and environment.
2. There are free shuttle buses to and from the airport and Disney, which is very considerate and convenient. But it should be noted that Disney has only two departure and pick-up times every morning and evening, and they are very punctual, so friends with procrastination must be careful üòÇThe airport pick-up is every two hours, and reservations need to be made in advance.
3. It is particularly important to note that when booking the hotel, due to a mistake, I booked one less room. Before leaving, I found that the price had been much higher. After contacting the hotel, the staff Lingling, Xiaowanzi, and Mengmeng helped to coordinate and communicate. In the end, I added a room at the booked price. The three staff members helped me communicate very seriously and responsibly, and also helped to contact the ticket office to book tickets for the park, which made my trip very smooth.
If you have friends who need to go to Disney, I suggest you choose this hotel boldly and confidently, and you will not be disappointed. In fact, I also read the reviews before booking. A hotel with so many good reviews must not be bad. Sure enough, the good reviews were true. üòÉ

msg:I haven‚Äôt booked a hotel with Ctrip in the past year. After staying in other hotels in the past two weeks that were pretty good, I thought about trying Ctrip‚Äôs benefits, so I chose this hotel where Ctrip upgraded my room. The result was so funny, the room was upgraded. Yes, the room is 20 yuan more expensive... Looking left and right, comparing pictures, I don't think it is expensive for 20 yuan, but it doesn't matter if I sleep alone for one nightüòë
As a result, this room is noisy during the day, but why is it so noisy at night? In the middle of the night, something hit the window several times, and there were knocking sounds from time to time in the corridor... It was even worse in the morning. Ctrip offered to check out at 2 o'clock, but starting from 12 o'clock, there was the sound of linen being hauled outside the door, and the sound of rushing water, which was intermittent. The sound of the vacuum cleaner... I came here to sleep. If a hotel can't even provide basic quietness, can it still be considered a hotel?

From the lobby to the room, it was clean and refreshing, and the decoration was very grand. The front desk upgraded the room type for free, which was an unexpected surprise.
The walls and floors in the bathroom are all made of gray marble, which is classy and not easily outdated. I like this timeless decoration style. The whole house is equipped with smart switches, which is very convenient. However, the exhaust fan has a low presence and cannot be turned on. There is no sound. I don't know if it is broken or too silent.
There was a mishap when I left. My watch was left in the mezzanine of the bag and I couldn't find it when I got home. I thought I had left it in the room. The staff took a video to help me find the watch attentively and took the trouble to find it everywhere. I finally found it in my bag, so I'm very sorry.
Thanks again to Mengmeng, Mengmeng, Jiajia and other staff for their attentive service.

msg:I am very satisfied with the hotel I chose this time. The facilities from the lobby to the guest rooms are great. The front desk staff Weiwei and Guanguan are warm and considerate. They upgraded our room for us, gave us breakfast, and helped us reserve the Disney shuttle bus. This is This is particularly important. We made a special trip to Disneyland when we went to Shanghai this time. It was very convenient to have a shuttle bus to pick us up in the morning and evening! The location of the hotel itself is very close to Disney. It is the right hotel to stay when visiting Disney. In addition, the breakfast is also great. There are many kinds of food, including Chinese and Western food. The milk is fresh milk, not powdered milk, which is very important for children.

msg:I am very satisfied with everything. The front desk is warm and thoughtful, the room is clean and tidy, the breakfast is rich and varied, and eight bottles of purified water are provided a day. If I am really dissatisfied at all, the bed in the twin room is a bit small. In general hotels, two beds are 1.2 meters tall. The bed, here is 1 meter.
Then I don‚Äôt know the airport pick-up and drop-off during the day. There are only two buses at night, one at 10:30 and the other one I forgot. This feels not very friendly. There are also two Disney shuttle buses in the morning, the first at 7:15 and the second at around 8:00. There are two pick-ups in the evening, one at around 9 o'clock and the other at around 10 o'clock. The car is parked in the Donald Duck parking lot. It takes about 1.5 kilometers to get off the car and walk to the entrance in the morning. Because the parking lot is not close to the ticket gate, and there is an infinitely long S-curve at the entrance, it takes 5,000 steps before entering the park.
The photo of the room was not taken, but the photo was taken of the lunch order in the restaurant on the second floor. The taste is flawless and the price is moderate.

2. We upgraded the room with a bathtub for free, and also gave children meal coupons and welcome fruits. Very happy!
3. There is a constant-temperature swimming pool. Although it is not big, there are not many people and there are rescuers. The children have a good time.
4. The breakfast buffet has many types, including 7.8 types of bread, 3 types of sushi, several types of porridge and fruits, and freshly made pasta and fried foods. My baby loves Dafu the most.
5. There are many free Disney buses and they depart on time.
Overall, it is a Marriott experience at the price of a Home Inn, great! I will choose here again next time I come to Disney!

The family room we stayed in was priced at more than 700. The window was so low and still open. The child accidentally fell out without looking carefully. Couldn't the hotel management see this safety hazard? The room facilities are old, the furniture is old, and it doesn't even have a bathtub at this price, which is really a bummer.
Take a look at the breakfast bowl for yourself, it‚Äôs still hairy, don‚Äôt step on it.

After arriving at the hotel late, the front desk guy Ouyang Lv upgraded the room, and the Dandan account manager gave me breakfast as a gift. We specially prepared snack bags for late night snacks. We love the humanistic care and healing smile. The hotel lobby is spacious, the shower water in the room needs to be upgraded, and the sound insulation is a flaw. 350 yuan including 2.5 breakfasts is very satisfying. When leaving the store, manager Chen Jing walked me out with a thermos cup gift box, and kindly promised that I would get a discount next time I come back during the peak season. I feel that the people at Wanxin Hotel are working hard to warm every guest, and these efforts cover up all kinds of things. The breakfast is simple and tasty, and the service staff is polite and peaceful. Children's strollers are not provided and can be rented to Disney for ten minutes.

msg:: In order to give my son and wife a better experience when going to Disneyland, I have been making travel guides. Finally, I booked the Pudong Theme Park Wanxin Hotel. It is very close to Disneyland and there is a shuttle bus, which is very convenient. It‚Äôs great, and you don‚Äôt have to waste a long time on the road. It‚Äôs very nice. After exiting Disneyland, turn right and go to the Donald Duck parking lot. There is an overpass to walk over. It‚Äôs only about ten minutes away. Their shuttle buses will stop here. In order to make it easier for us to find the specific location of the bus, the ladies at the front desk who checked in (Xiaowanzi and Mengmeng) would also personally pull us into a shuttle bus group. They were really meticulous and arranged in an orderly manner. At that time, the customs manager asked us if we wanted to go to Pudong Airport. There is also a shuttle bus. The service was really impeccable. Every staff member greeted us when they saw us.
Environment: The hotel is in the style of an old five-star hotel. In order to make our rest more comfortable, the front desk staff also upgraded the room. Adults and children have a bed each. The children like this room very much. It is also a themed family format. The children wanted to take away the dolls in the room before leaving.
Facilities: The hotel we booked provides breakfast from 6:30 to 9:30 in the morning. It has Chinese and Western styles. It is also a self-service style. It is clean and hygienic. You can get what you want, as long as it is not wasted. We basically eat early and then set off. After a day of playing, we will be very tired and hungry. After eating in the morning, we can eat anything at Disneyland at noon.
Service: As soon as we arrived at the hotel gate, two comrades An Bao An and Xiao Ye took the initiative to help us open the door and pick up our luggage. Then the hotel concierges Xiao Xu and Bao Sen led us to the front desk to go through the formalities. It was cold and they gave us I poured a cup of warm tea. The front desk staff were very attentive and the check-in was very fast. I would like to praise Xiaowanzi and Mengmeng again. The hotel also has a scheduled shuttle bus to pick up and drop off Disney at the station, but you need to contact us in advance. When we make a reservation at the hotel front desk, the lady at the front desk will take the initiative to pull us into a shuttle bus group. The driver will count the number of people and send location information. When we go, we can get off the bus 5 minutes early and get on the bus in front of the hotel. If you are coming back, you have to take a bus at the Donald Duck parking lot. If you can't make it, it's not expensive to take a taxi back.
Hygiene: The hotel overall feels very clean, and the environmental hygiene is also good. The aunt in the guest room will clean it regularly. If you don't want the room to be cleaned, you can also press the do not disturb mode, or you can tell the lady at the front desk, and the aunt in the guest room will also clean it. I won't go in and clean. Takes great care of guests' privacy. I would like to give special praise to Xiaowanzi. This young lady helped us deliver our luggage. I also had a room, and she also helped me arrange a room not far from my son's room. It was very considerate. In short, this hotel is a good choice. Friends who come to Disney can also choose this hotel, which is very cost-effective. recommend! recommend! recommend!

The shower will be cold, and everyone comments on how small the water flow is. 2: There was a loud scream after the toilet was flushed. 3: We booked two rooms, one with body lotion and one without body lotion. We collected lotion, but there was no lotion in either room the next day. I don‚Äôt know whether the hotel didn‚Äôt have this standard, or the lotion was used by the cleaning lady. After all, it was winter. 4: The bus to Disney should be outsourced. The tour guide above said that you can ask a tour guide to save time, have special passages, and avoid queuing. 5: Breakfast is very average, nothing special. This is nonsense, friends, please don‚Äôt step on it. I went there on Chris**as Eve and booked an early price of more than 500. I think the price is not bad, but if you label it as a 5-star hotel with such a high rating, it is a bit fake.

Environment: The hotel is spacious and bright. Shanghai already has a very festive a**osphere during the Chris**as season. The morning sunlight shining into the room is still very comfortable!

Service: Make a reservation with the hotel one day in advance before going to the airport. You can take the hotel shuttle to Disneyland, which only takes about 15 minutes by car. When you come back in the evening, fruits and cookies have been prepared in the room. Maybe you know that I am a regular customer, so when you check out They gave gifts to the children and me, and also brought a large bag of snacks and water for us to eat on the way; the breakfast time was also very friendly;

msg:The hotel is very close to Pudong Airport and Disneyland. The airport pick-up driver was enthusiastic and good at communicating. When my daughter and I got off the plane at 1 o'clock in the afternoon, the driver took the initiative to contact us. It took almost 50 minutes to get out of the customs. The driver just happened to drop off the guests. At Pudong Airport, we were asked to go to the departure hall on the third floor and wait to board the bus at gate 29. We were picked up smoothly and arrived at the hotel in less than 20 minutes. We originally agreed to pick up the car at the underground parking lot at three o'clock, but luckily we arrived at the hotel at half past two.
When we checked into the hotel, the lobby manager upgraded our room type and gave us a bag of small gifts. The hotel lobby is grand, and the room you stay in is clean and hygienic. The bathroom has been recently renovated. There are bathrobes and slippers in the room. Daily necessities such as toothbrushes and toothpaste are also provided. The room has no peculiar smell. The cleaning aunt cleans and tidies the room every day, and she also greets us politely when we meet in the corridor.
The hotel's breakfast is very rich. For the price of the hotel, this breakfast is beyond expectations. Freshly ground coffee, yogurt, Chinese noodles, wontons, steamed buns and stir-fries, Western breads and cakes, etc. My daughter ate two bowls of chicken soup wontons.
The buffet restaurant on the second floor is also known as Shanghai Side Dishes. It provides rich dining options at noon and evening. We had dinner many times during our stay and it tasted good.

If I have the opportunity to come to Shanghai Disney next time, I will consider staying at Wanxin Hotel.

The front desk service provided room upgrade service in person, and basically responded to any needs without disturbing the guests too much. The check-out process was especially smooth. Thanks to the service of Xiaowanzi, Mengmeng, and Xiaoye teams. Cleaning is done in person, the room can be effectively cleaned, and items can be replenished in a timely manner. In terms of hardware, there is nothing to fault. The bed in the room is very comfortable, the window sill lighting, light control, small refrigerator, safe, etc. are basically in line with five-star standards. The mineral water provided is delicious, the bathtub is comfortable, and there are disposable bath bags. Disposable toilet cover. The Disney shuttle bus is very convenient. I didn't catch it when I went there, but I experienced it once on the return trip. The bus took me directly to the hotel.
Here are some tips for hotel management:
1. If possible, upgrade the TV. The current TV does not match the positioning of the hotel. I cannot watch programs on the TV in this room.
2. The safety switch cover in the wardrobe has fallen off, remember to install it.
3. I didn‚Äôt experience the airport pick-up service because I arrived too late. I didn‚Äôt remember there was a drop-off until I took a taxi when I checked out. It is recommended that the hotel can remind guests whether they need this service when checking in or before checking out.
I think the hotel is very cost-effective and convenient for going to Disney. I will stay here again next time I come.

Regardless of decoration and service, there is a huge gap between it and a five-star hotel: I booked half a month in advance and it was noted that the two rooms are adjacent, far away from the elevator and quiet. After submitting the application, the hotel confirmed it. However, when checking in, we were given 508 and 513. There was no hot water for bathing in 508, and the water output from the shower head was very small. 513 was next to the elevator, and the sound of the elevator going up and down was clear in the room, seriously affecting sleep. Since the request cannot be met, you can inform it in advance or communicate it at the front desk. The decoration is also lackluster. It doesn't look like a new decoration at all.

Don‚Äôt listen to the people below when you get off the car. The result is... The same raincoat costs RMB 20, but she sells it for RMB 20. This shuttle experience is poor.

msg:My husband and I went shopping in Disney and Bicester. We looked at many surrounding hotels and finally chose Wanxin. We stayed for 2 nights and was very satisfied. The room was clean and the breakfast was rich. There is a shuttle bus to and from Disney in the morning and evening. It is also very close to Bicester. On the first day I arrived, I went to the hotel restaurant for dinner. The food was good and cost-effective. Because I like fitness, I also went to the hotel gym in the evening. The equipment was very professional and rich. There was also a spa. I was a little rushed this time and didn‚Äôt have time to experience it. , must try it next time. In general, whether it is hotel facilities, health conditions, hotel services, or catering, it is very good. I will definitely choose to stay here next time I come to Shanghai.

I would like to praise a staff member who wears glasses. When we went around to the back of the hotel to consult him when there was no parking space, he saw that we took the shortcut with our children.

The location is very close to Disneyland and the hotel has a shuttle bus, which is very convenient. They upgraded the room type for free and also gave us breakfast. We were very satisfied. The service at Weiweiguan Pass and Xiaowanzi was very warm. Thoughtful, like üëç. I forgot the small gift I bought at Disney when I left. The hotel helped me find it and sent it to my home. Thank you very much!

Since we bought an early morning pass, we didn't have time to take the early bus and didn't have breakfast, but the hotel was very considerate and prepared cookies and milk. It would be better if we informed in advance that we could pack breakfast. When I take the shuttle bus back in the evening, I inform the time and location in the group chat in advance. This is particularly good.

I would also like to give special thanks to Huang Jian and Xin Yi at the front desk. Because the family decided to come together temporarily, they gave a very thoughtful breakfast when they checked in. Thank you so much!
When it comes to hotel breakfast, it is very rich. You can eat from 6:30 to 9:30, hot dishes, cold dishes, drinks, and desserts. . . Customers with different needs can be satisfied.

1) The sound insulation is very poor. The walls are made of paper. You can clearly hear the toilet flushing and phone calls next door. People who are light sleepers cannot sleep.
2) It is said to be an airport pick-up, but it runs every two hours, which means that you will most likely need to spend 50 yuan on it. It is not worth it. There are hidden additional fees.

After searching for 20 minutes, there was no seat. We asked the waiter to open the Chinese restaurant next to us, but they said that the Chinese restaurant was not under their control and could not be opened.
2. There were many people eating breakfast, but the food was not served in time. Many plates were empty. I walked around with the plate and got three shrimp crackers.
3. There were several people standing there who looked like they were in charge, but they didn‚Äôt do anything. He said he couldn't find a location and asked him to keep looking. Really speechless

It was unexpected and heartwarming. When checking in, the front desk took the initiative to ask if there was a free shuttle bus for Disney, and prompted to register.

The room is clean and tidy, and the staff is very helpful It's great~ I didn't catch the shuttle bus from Pudong Airport because of the time problem, but I took the shuttle bus to and from Disney, which is very good and convenient~ The breakfast is very rich, and there are many choices for adults and children~Because environmental protection does not take the initiative to provide bathroom disposables, When I checked in, I offered a toothbrush, but when I went up, I found that there was no shower cap and disposable razor, and I called the front desk to deliver it to the room~ In short, this hotel is the best choice for going to Disneyland. If there is a chance, I will definitely Come back again and definitely recommend it to friends~

First of all, I would like to express my appreciation for the overall environment of the hotel. Wanxin Hotel Paradise Branch has a superior geographical location and convenient transportation, which provides tourists with great convenience. The hotel's design style is unique, reflecting the prosperity of the modern city without losing the charm of traditional culture. In addition, the hotel's hardware facilities are first-class, whether it is guest rooms, restaurants or conference rooms, they can meet various high-end needs. In terms of service, Weiweifangfang and Xiaoqiang's performance is particularly outstanding. They always maintained warm smiles, and no matter what needs I raised, they were able to meet them quickly and accurately, making me feel cared for like family.

msg:This hotel is not close to Disney, and it is not convenient to take a taxi. Moreover, the connection between the hotel and Disney is almost zero! The key point is that the driver of the shuttle bus is very irresponsible. There were only two shuttle buses that took me back. I couldn't find where the shuttle bus stopped at that time. When I called the driver, no one answered the phone! I searched for a way for a while. It was less than 3 minutes late from the departure time and there were only a few people on the bus. I told the driver that I would be arriving soon, but the driver had no patience at all and was unwilling to wait at all. He was in a hurry to get there. The car drove away! In the end, I spent 80 yuan to take a taxi back to the hotel. When I arrived at the hotel entrance, I found the driver slowly sitting in the car in front of the hotel, doing nothing. It was really unlucky to encounter such an irresponsible driver! Very poor experience

In the evening, the hotel has two buses to pick up at Disney at 21:05 There are two buses at 10:20, just after watching the light show and fireworks, which is very good. If you forget your toothbrush, you can ask for it at the service desk, but we brought it ourselves. Send a few photos of the hotel and Disney for reference.

Facilities: The roller blind design in the bathroom pays attention to privacy, which is very good; the laundry room is not yet open, which is a little inconvenient; it is recommended to add a storage table for mobile phones in the toilet area; when there is water on the ground, the soles of the slippers are slippery and almost fell, it is recommended to replace them non-slip slippers slippers


Hygiene: The room is clean; the Shanghai side dish restaurant on the second floor, the dishes in the cafeteria were not washed in the morning, and there were residues on them. This is a matter of principle. I feel that food hygiene is the most important thing. It is unacceptable, and points will be deducted


Environment: The environment can be rated as five-star, and the price is also suitable. It is recommended to set up a children's area on the first floor, or set up a children's activity playground next to the negative gym, and then set up a large transparent glass wall. Parents can exercise by themselves and watch their children. It is definitely attractive force. It is recommended to add some children's cartoon sofas, toys, slides, etc. to the room, create some parent-child Disney-themed rooms, or send Disney headbands (just add a little cost to the room rate), which will add points.

The feeling of a five-star hotel can be more popular than the Disneyland Hotel if you work harder and put your heart into it. After all, the price is there. If there are more equipment, two or three hundred more is also acceptable.

The biggest highlight of this hotel is the excellent breakfast! Because Disney is in the suburbs, it is more difficult to eat, and the hotel is somewhat dirty and messy in places with a lot of takeaways. I chose for several hours, and finally chose this one. It is especially suitable for bringing children. Other hotels have less variety of food, and the hotel is also good. It's all fast food, simple meal!

2. There was a slight smell in the room on the first day of check-in.
3. Someone was drilling an impact drill upstairs at 8:30 in the morning. The reason is unknown. It may be an emergency repair, otherwise no normal person would provide this kind of ** service early in the morning.
I would still like to stay here next time and give thumbs up to the service staff of this hotel.

The room has a strong rusty and old house smell, and the carpet is also dirty. Rust can be seen on the small tables, cabinets, shower areas, etc... It smells like a corridor. It also smelled like a cheap hotel. When I stepped out of the elevator, I could smell the smell of takeout and water all over the corridor. Because I was very tired from playing and expected that all the rooms would be similar, I didn't ask to change rooms. I have sensitive skin, and I developed some rashes on my legs after sleeping one night. I wonder if it was the little mites on the bed. Anyway, I won't go there a second time...I was really cheated.

When I got to the room, I wanted to ask someone to send the child's toothbrush and slippers, but no one answered the phone, which was very annoying!
The worst thing is that the child and I have been itching since we entered the room. Especially when we were lying on the bed, the child's back was red from scratching.

The dust removal and vacuuming in the room are not good, and particles floating in the air can be seen when people move. Disposable items are of poor quality. The cleaning lady omits steps for the sake of speed. For example, she doesn't know how to tidy up the bed sheets and utensils.
The only advantage is that it is close to Disney and has a food delivery robot.

She even answered the phone while we were checking in, and slowly and leisurely left us alone. She didn't even say a word of apology. We just dragged our luggage there and waited for her. The whole process took 20 minutes before we could check in. She was still on the phone, which was extremely unprofessional! After a day of playing at Disneyland, I had to wait in line all day long to see an expressionless and perfunctory face. It was the female staff member with the slender eyes. I have never encountered such a terrible check-in experience. , we couldn't bear it anymore and asked another male staff member to handle the matter. This is that even the most basic staff training is not done well, and the sound insulation is not good. I was woken up by children at 7 o'clock in the morning. In short, the check-in experience is not good.

Many accommodations now provide children's slippers. Traveling with children. The fact that the hotel clearly states that children are welcome is great. Children eat breakfast for free. The buffet breakfast is very rich and not perfunctory at all.) There is also a Disney shuttle bus which is also very convenient. It‚Äôs just that the frequency is a little less.

He asked him if he had reserved the shuttle bus. He nodded and didn't answer. Who asked him the question? I owed him money, so I gave him a room number, 4XX, without saying a word. We went up to the 4th floor and saw that the room numbers all had four digits starting with 8. We thought it must be right. They should have added 4 at the beginning according to Chinese custom. Number 8. After finding the room, the door could not be opened. I didn‚Äôt believe it. I tried several times. I had never encountered this situation before. Then I called the front desk to tell us that the house number was correct and asked us to go downstairs to change the room card. , I took my 2 children and luggage and walked around to the lobby several times, and then another front desk gentleman looked at it and told Mr. Xu that I gave him the wrong room card. During the check-in process, Mr. Xu received a call on his mobile phone and continued to answer calls for a long time. What about the guests who checked in? He didn't say a word and ignored us throughout the whole process. Later, the manager helped us drag our luggage to the room and upgraded our room the next day. Thank you very much! But the first impression is very bad. The price of 700 is not very cheap, and it should not be a bad hotel. Why is the front desk so bad? I really hate it and will not stay again!

The facilities are average, the toilet bowl and toilet seat do not match, and the mattress is too soft and has no support. The cleaning staff finished cleaning and threw the rags on the bedside. The hotel does not have its own restaurant. To eat, we relied on the meal coupons given by the front desk. We went to a restaurant on the second floor. When we arrived at the hotel, it was a little after 2 o'clock. I wanted to have a meal, but the restaurant on the second floor did not serve food at 2 noon. You had to go out and turn right to a nearby place. mutton soup or Shaxian snacks, otherwise you have to take a taxi to a restaurant a few kilometers away. The bonus is that it‚Äôs a thirty minute drive to Disney.
