msg:Beautiful hotel. Service is okay but not what you would expect from a five star accommodation.  The lounge / bar was closed. Only one restaurant which seemed to be only open for breakfast dine-in. We could order in though. Everything was very slow paced. Overall, the hotel felt a bit deserted, which could be great for some travellers...

msg:Three days before Labor Day, I suddenly got excited and asked two adults to go to Wuxi together. My husband suddenly saw this hotel with villa-style rooms and wanted to take his parents to experience it, so he quickly booked 3 rooms for 3 days and 2 nights.
[Communication before check-in] Because I was traveling with my parents, I was used to contacting the hotel in advance and asked them to reserve 3 adjacent rooms. At the same time, I asked about the extra bed. The hotel confirmed the demand very smoothly.
[Butler service] Before check-in, I added the butler WeChat in advance. The butler Lasa provided us with services throughout the whole process. Thank you very much. The butler responded very quickly and the meticulous service made us feel very good throughout the trip.
[Extra bed] It is worth mentioning that their extra bed service is very reasonable, 500 per night, but it includes a breakfast. The extra bed can be placed on the first floor, and there is enough space.
[Breakfast] My family basically travels together around 7:30 for breakfast. There are not many people in the restaurant. Although there are not many choices, the noodles and wontons are freshly cooked, and there are many choices of toppings. The taste is very good.
[Accommodation] It's quite cool in this season, and there are not many bugs, but the main thing is to remember to close the door or pull the screen window after checking in, otherwise there will definitely be bugs on the first floor running in. Mosquito repellent will be provided, and it is also very convenient to replace it after use. The room is very spacious, and there are toilets and showers upstairs and downstairs, which is quite convenient. L'Occitane's toiletries.
[Service] In fact, the scenery of the entire park is very garden-like, but it is slightly lacking in maintenance. I originally thought that there were fewer people on Labor Day, which lowered the expectations of hotel services. After all, we have to understand the peak period. As a result, whether it is the shuttle bus for travel or the room cleaning, the hotel staff serve with a friendly smile. When it rains, they will help to park under the eaves. It's really thoughtful. When traveling to Sunac Mall, they can also deliver to the nearest door, and they will also inform the description of the return pick-up point, which is very convenient.
[Special services] They have a small boat experience, which is very good. Because there are not many people and boats, you need to make an appoin**ent with the housekeeper in advance. You can choose to deliver from the lobby to the room, or you can choose to make an appoin**ent to pick up in the room and deliver to the lobby. It's a very interesting experience. The big sister who runs the boat is also very kind.
[Off topic] Actually, before this trip, I read a lot of bad reviews on Xiaohongshu, Dianping, and Ctrip, and I was a little hesitant, but after the actual trip, I really felt that it was not as bad as they said, especially the hotel service. The brothers and uncles who helped us send us were all very kind and thoughtful. Thank you very much! 
So I will write a long article to describe my real personal experience for your reference.

You can take a boat to enter the house. After checking in, add the housekeeper's WeChat and provide 24-hour service. The service is very considerate and almost responsive. It is very suitable for a family to come for vacation and leisure. The scenery in the park is very beautiful. Take a walk in the forest, catch fish by the river, watch the small bridge and flowing water on the balcony, and drink tea. It is very comfortable.

The facilities were old and some of them could even be described as shabby. It really didn't deserve the word "luxury hotel". My friends said it was only worth 600 or 700 yuan at most! Having stayed in so many hotels, it's really hard for me to describe it!

msg:This is my third time staying in the two-bedroom courtyard room of this hotel because it is very cost-effective and has the style of the ancient Jiangnan town of my dreams. "Spring water is bluer than the sky, and I sleep on a painted boat listening to the rain" is really the feeling described by ancient literati and poets, with white walls and black tiles, and Hui-style architecture. The lady who cleaned the room the next day was my fellow villager (both from Shandong), and she was very enthusiastic. The hotel itself is a scene, and every shot you take is like an ink painting.

msg:I often come to Wuxi, but this is the first time I brought my family to Xuelang Songpin Hotel. I experienced the feeling of staying in a two-bedroom lake view villa and a one-bedroom river view villa for three nights and four days. Both the two-bedroom lake view house and the one-bedroom river view house are two-story Hui-style courtyard villas. Flowers and plants are planted inside and outside the courtyard, and are arranged at random with rockeries. You can also enjoy the red and white plum blossoms that are still in bloom. , it’s really pleasing to the eye. The living room in the room is high and spacious, and the Chinese style is both luxurious and comfortable; the bedroom is clean and bright, fully equipped, quiet and comfortable. The back doors and windows of the two villas face the river. Whether you stand in front of the window, or go out and stand on the riverside platform or the steps of the river port, the clear river water flows slowly before your eyes. The hotel is large in scale, with lakes, rivers, pavilions, flowers and trees scattered among it, and together with the Anhui-style buildings including the lobby and guest rooms, it forms an exquisite and beautiful large-scale garden. The only shortcoming is that there are some deficiencies in management. A few dead and collapsed bamboos and trees have not been dealt with, and some damaged scenic spots, facilities and trails have not been repaired in time, which affects the overall appearance.
      The service attitude of the hotel staff is commendable. Whether it is the butler-style service of the reception staff at the front desk, the cleaning service of the room cleaner Miao Fengni, or the pick-up and meal delivery services of the battery car driver Li Youtao, they are all very enthusiastic and meticulous towards our elderly guests. The thoughtfulness made us feel warm.

msg:The butler service, pick-up and drop-off, and every service staff in the restaurant are very enthusiastic and take the trouble. The hotel's environment is generally good, but the so-called lake view still needs to be cleaned and constructed. There are actually many flowers and plants in the park but there is no formal pruning and maintenance. , it’s a bit of a waste of such a beautiful view. It is obvious that a lot of thought has been put into decorating the room and lobby. There are two problems with the room. One is that the switch on one side of the bedside table is malfunctioning, one of the bedside lamps does not light up, and there is a switch on one side of the washbasin. Slightly blocked. Everything else is pretty good.

The manager Tom and the housekeeper service are very good, and the service is available 24 hours a day. I forgot to bring my high blood pressure medicine, so I called ** to buy medicine, and the housekeeper sent a car to the room in the middle of the night.
The sound therapy course is also very good. Teacher Muchen is very professional. The whole course is very relaxing. Although I didn’t fall asleep completely because of curiosity, I felt refreshed after the end, as if I had a real good sleep.
The whole hotel is very quiet, the environment is elegant, and the small bridge and flowing water are extremely suitable for relaxation away from the hustle and bustle of the city.
Highly recommended

msg:Let me first say the conclusion: I will definitely bring my family here next time I have a holiday! This was a very satisfying trip. Although I didn't leave the hotel because my son had a fever, I still felt the spiritual rest brought by the change of time and space from the overall design and service of the hotel. The hotel is very suitable for guests who pursue a "quiet" vacation. The usual busyness can enter the slow-paced rest mode from the moment you enter the park. The cruise check-in, the single-family garden view, the 24-hour butler service, etc. can all feel the beauty of vacation and rest. During the three-night stay, the child's fever repeated, which caused a lot of trouble to the hotel, but the butler delivered the takeaway very promptly and helped us tirelessly. I am also very grateful to Aunt Miao Fengyan who cleaned our room. I have serious cleanliness and high requirements for the room. Auntie hit every detail super well, and she also cared about the children very much. My mother was not used to sleeping on a soft bed, and she immediately turned the mattress over for her to sleep on the hard side, which was truly customer-oriented. The dishes in the Chinese restaurant are delicate in taste, and each dish is very exquisite. Thank you Xuelang Songyuan Hotel for your care and service during this Qingming Festival. See you next time!

msg:I just read the negative reviews of this hotel, and most of them overlap with my own experiences. The earliest one was reviewed in 2022. With no improvement in two years, what hope does this hotel have?
Environment: Regardless of the river or lake view, it is a dirty river, and some of the pavilions have collapsed and have not been repaired. The villa was overgrown with ****s inside and outside, and the landscaping was unkempt and in a mess.
Facilities: The overall appearance of the villa is okay, but the door lock is difficult and feels like it is about to break. There is an abnormal sound when the air conditioner is turned on. I checked in at night and the villa was pitch black as soon as I entered the gate. You can only touch the light switch by turning on the light of your mobile phone. Other hotels will help turn on the lights in advance before customers arrive. The most important thing is that the sheets of the quilt are actually torn. I am really speechless.
Service: I feel that 2/3 are new people, and the service is only form, without spirit. Other hotels of the same level or even hotels with half the price will have a butler add WeChat in advance. The housekeeper's WeChat account here is only added when checking in. The reason why we don't add it in advance is that we can only see our virtual mobile phone number. Then before I checked in, a hotel employee called me and the first thing he said was to ask me if there were any changes to my itinerary. He also said that hotel rooms were very tight and what time I would check in. Do you mean to tell me not to stay here? Yesterday I was visiting the tourist attractions and the hotel called me again. They wanted to upgrade my two river view villas into one lake view villa on the pretext of upgrading my room to a lake view. The area has been reduced by 60 square meters, and the room is said to be tight. Does the tension in your room have anything to do with me? Just because I got the room coupon from Double Eleven Tunnel affects you to sell it at a high price now, right? It greatly affects my mood while playing. Checking in at 10pm, there were no obvious signs in the hotel parking lot, so we couldn't find it. The parking lot was empty, and the staff said that the rooms were all occupied. The check-in employee was unskilled and another employee taught me on the spot. Same goes for breakfast, one employee teaches another employee not to block the way of guests. The same goes for checking out. The receptionist directly said that he had just arrived. I'm so grateful that the entire hotel is supported by new people. I checked out of the room at 9:30 in the morning. At 2:30 in the afternoon, the housekeeper came to ask if the room needed to be extended. Don’t you check the actual situation before asking your customers? The breakfast standard of 268 is not worth it at all.
I wrote a lot of summaries, except that the rooms in this hotel are villa-type, everything else is completely inconsistent with the price, I advise you to give up, don't come!

msg:I’ve always wanted to go to Wuxi to see the cherry blossoms. I’m very busy at work, so it’s hard to find time to take time off and come to Wuxi this year. In order to avoid unnecessary distractions, I chose the most expensive hotel in Wuxi - Wuxi Xuelang Songpin Hotel. I thought it was a beautiful meditation trip, but I didn't expect it to become a nightmare.
1. Inconsistent service promises: I found on the Internet that the hotel can take a boat to the room. Before booking, I called the front desk to confirm that "you can contact the housekeeper at any time to take photos with the boat when you are not busy." However, after checking in, the front desk informed that the boat can be used once. Once you use it, you can't borrow it again. It feels like you've been defrauded, but it doesn't hurt. At worst, you don't want to take the boat to check in and take pictures later, so I choose to take the battery car to the room.
2. Damage to the guest's finances: It was precisely because of the inconsistency at the front desk (or perhaps out of fear of trouble) that I chose to take a battery car to the room. The hotel damaged my 10,000-yuan suitcase. This suitcase was purchased during the epidemic and was basically basic after purchase. I didn't leave Beijing, so I didn't use it at all, and when I used it this time, I was careful and it was basically as good as new. However, the hotel's battery cart did not take safety into account when transporting luggage and guests. It made a sharp turn and threw my box more than ten meters away, causing the front of the box to fall. Multiple injuries.
3. Threatening customers to challenge the bottom line: Regarding the financial damage, there was a female manager on duty at first, who had a very good attitude, although she did not give a good handling method. Then she changed to a man, who told me that the claim settlement time would be long and made me give up. This idea immediately angered me. I asked which insurance company it was from, but they were still unwilling to provide it. Later, a so-called marketing manager, Ms. Jiang Xiaoyan, said righteously that she had used my personal information and the box’s ID code to check the purchase record of the box without authorization. I had bought the box for more than two years, and who knew who caused the wear and tear, which angered me again.
4. Not active in refunding: The case of the box was finally settled, and Ctrip intervened and compensated more than 1,000 yuan. If this attitude and rhetoric had not been used earlier, we would not have had any trouble in Wuxi. unhappy.
5. Room hygiene issues: For a room fee of more than 2,600 yuan, there are leftover snacks from the previous guest in the room, hair on the bed, and an unknown black substance in the bathtub. The hygiene conditions are not as good as those of an express hotel worth several hundred yuan.
6. Hotel safety hazards: The price of a lake view room is twice that of a river view room. However, the so-called lake view is artificial water that has not been taken care of for a long time, not Taihu Lake, and the plank roads by the lake are all damaged. If children are not taken care of, Running around is a huge safety hazard.
7. Other service issues: Before checking in, I consulted with the hotel about the free travel photos included in the package. The ******* who answered the phone insisted that our package did not include travel photos, which caused us to waste time repeatedly confirming with Ctrip. In fact, the package included it, and we didn’t know what the front desk said. Why did the lady do this? She set out to take pictures at 6:30 in the morning and asked the hotel to deliver breakfast to the room at 6:10. She thought that at least there would be hot porridge or eggs, but the meal price of more than 500 yuan only gave two breads and a bag of yogurt. , simply unable to support the physical strength of playing in the scenic spot for half a day, and a customer butler named Tom kept telling you that breakfast will not be served until 6:30, which is good, and the next day we changed hotels due to disputes (only Xuelang Song (Half the price of hotel tasting), departure at 5:00 in the morning, the hotel sent bread, donuts, yogurt, eggs, some fruits, and also expressed its apology.
8. If the experience is poor, it is the customer's problem: I stayed at Wuxi Xuelang Songpin Hotel for a total of 14 hours. Apart from sleeping and eating out, I was just defending my rights. I didn't really experience the hotel, let alone the more than 500 yuan for breakfast, check-in or check-in for two in the package. Check-out cruise experience, etc., but the other party emphasized that we did not ask to change rooms ourselves. Although they did not take the initiative to change rooms for us, the hotel would change us if we did. If we did not mention it, it is the customer's fault. To this day, there is only compensation for the financial damage, but no compensation for the problems caused by the room and service.
It’s hard to imagine that this is the most expensive hotel in Wuxi. The most expensive really doesn’t mean the best, or even good. Please stay safe.

msg:I am a lazy person, and I had a little incident during the trip. Ctrip helped solve it with thoughtful, warm and perfect help, so I would like to give it a special thumbs up.
I encountered a fake homestay and villa listing on Tongcheng next door. The location and indoor pictures were fake, which deceived a whole family. After complaining, Tongcheng silently said it and provided a 100 yuan discount voucher. As a compensation. I*, simply treat Black Whale members as human beings.
I haven’t used Ctrip for a long time. I didn’t expect Ctrip to help me, an unpopular user, solve a small problem before traveling so generously and thoughtfully. I was very touched and decided to use Ctrip more in the future.
As for the hotel, the environment is quite good and the hotel's service is particularly considerate. The housekeeper responds online 24 hours a day and delivers anything you need to your door immediately.
In Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai, I think the combination of Songpin and Sunac Culture and Tourism is a very suitable route for parent-child travel. It combines the "Ten Miles of Fangfei" resort, the paradise style of Haichang, the landscape style of Suzhou's east and west mountains, and the perfect The commercial facilities and the Breathing Forest Farmhouse at the foot of Xuelang Mountain are also very unique. (Compared to many high-end private restaurants nearby, a restaurant like Breathing Forest that offers sincere and delicious fresh food is more popular among young and middle-aged people like me.)
Overall, it was a great and very happy travel experience. Thank you Ctrip and Xuelang Songpin! If I find any photos later, I’ll share them if I have a chance. This package is indeed very suitable for parent-child family travel in Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai, 💯!

Although the location is relatively remote, it is quite convenient in all aspects. However, the design of the hotel is questionable in many places, with poor functionality and poor maintenance of facilities. But because the service staff, including the front desk, battery car driver, etc., provided good service, I couldn't bear to give it a too low rating. Not worth recommending

The upstairs balcony is also very large and you can sit and enjoy the beautiful scenery. It is also refreshing and refreshing. There is a shuttle bus from the hotel to pick up and drop off. It is very convenient. The food in the Chinese restaurant tastes good, so I have all my dinner here. I should choose this place next time I go outing. After all, my parents are very satisfied.

The only drawback is that the weather has been too cold these two days, the air conditioning in the room is not satisfactory, the temperature in the room is only about 20 degrees, and the electric heater is not very effective; As a hotel that has just opened a few years ago, the wallpaper is dirty, the carpets are old, and there is no smart toilet.

The butler service responded very quickly on the first day, but very slowly on the second day. There were still a few unanswered messages. I wonder if there were too many people to respond. Many areas of the hotel are still undergoing repairs, but it does not affect the overall experience. Overall, I am very satisfied, and the environmental services are worthy of the price.

There are photo opportunities everywhere in the hotel, which is especially friendly for adults and children who like to take photos.
It was my first experience to enter the villa gate by rowing a boat, which was a bit new. However, the attitude of the boat girl was average. Maybe because it was a free item, she complained a lot. If there is no free oar boat project, it will cost 200 yuan per boat.
The hotel's breakfast and dinner options are a bit limited, and the hot dishes are all on the cold side. The only hot items are freshly cooked noodle soup and wontons...
Although there were many small flaws in this trip, such as general hygiene, weak TV remote control and difficulty in watching TV, etc... But the service attitude was really good, so good that I couldn't lose my temper.

A free paddle boat experience, delivered directly to the dock at the back door of your room, is worth the experience. The room is large and the design is tasteful, but the small yard may be neglected, which makes it a little boring.

Facilities: The room can only be seen from a distance, and cannot be tolerated to take a closer look. Parts of the walls are mottled and peeling, the electric curtains in the bathroom are noisy, and the bedroom balcony sliding door doesn't work very well. The air conditioner in the bedroom is blowing directly on people when sleeping, which is not very comfortable. Also, I don’t know what makes a sharp noise from time to time. The washbasin is slightly short. Compared to such a large room, the bathroom and shower room are really small. The toiletries are better, all from the L'Occitane Verbena series. TV program resources are abundant.

Service: The housekeeper added WeChat the day before check-in and proactively introduced various services. If you want to go out, you can contact the housekeeper directly. He will help call the shuttle bus for door-to-door pick-up and drop-off. The reply is very timely. I went to Wanda next door in the evening, and the hotel shuttle bus can also pick me up. Afternoon tea was provided on the day of check-in. Fruits, salty snacks, and desserts were all available, and the production was exquisite. However, the seafood on the sandwiches did not look very fresh.

Hygiene: It's okay, but the corner of the shoe changing bench is not clean, and hair strands were found in the toilet.

  Meals: There are not many breakfast varieties, but they have everything you should have and the taste is okay.

  Overall, I'm quite satisfied and would consider staying again if I have the chance.

I asked the housekeeper that maybe the door card was not opened properly. I waited for an hour for the card, but the new card still couldn't open the door. I asked what to do. They said they had to find someone to fix the lock in the middle of the night...Have all the money been spent on decorating it for you? The housekeeper came to communicate one day in advance and proactively told you that you had a baby and prepared baby wash for you in advance. He repeated it again when he went to the hotel front desk. As a result, I was not prepared after moving in. If you order takeout from the hotel, you need to wait for the hotel shuttle bus to arrive, which takes an extra half hour. All in all, it’s just tiring and not worth it.

The decoration of the room is great, but the cleaning is not very careful. The dining table is sticky and we have to deal with it ourselves. There are also caterpillars and centipedes. The courtyard is not well maintained. The river is very dirty. It is advertised that you can check in by boat, but you have to make a reservation in advance.

I didn’t find out until I got back to the hotel. After contacting me, the housekeeping depar**ent went to swipe the room card. I found out that the room card was out of order. During this period, no staff contacted me to inform me about this. I waited for a long time when I returned to the door of the room. After contacting the housekeeping depar**ent and the front desk, the front desk sent me a new room card.
If you want a quiet vacation, a villa with its own small garden is enough. The occupancy rate in the villa area is not high and it is very quiet, but there are more mosquitoes. When I checked in, there was no doorman to help carry the luggage and open the door. It was not very convenient with children. The security guard at the door was very good and would help move things. But for a serious hotel, it still needs to be more formal. I went to the restaurant for dinner at 11:30. There was no guidance at the door from the moment I entered the Chinese restaurant. I had to fumble around on my own. When I arrived at the restaurant, the front desk was empty. I shouted before someone came over. I wanted to ask if the restaurant could deliver food. No one answered the phone. There was a problem with the room at the beginning and I asked the front desk if I could change the room. After asking, there was no news.
I still have a lot to complain about this hotel, but the environment is quiet. I hope the service can be more professional and I look forward to my next stay.

msg:This is my first time staying at a high-end store in Huazhu. Of course, the prices are not high-end. The good thing is that the room is big and the swimming pool is hot. At first glance, the surrounding area is an industrial park surrounded by Sunac hotels and shopping malls, and the atmosphere is very deserted. When the car drove into the hotel, it looked a bit impressive at first glance, but upon closer inspection, it was overgrown with ****s and completely bald. The security guard at the gate didn't take the initiative to move the luggage, and he didn't know where the front desk was. There were no service staff in the lobby. I finally found one who was checking his mobile phone. He turned around and ran away after he couldn't answer a few words. The housekeeper is very poor, his only function is to call the courtesy car and often there is no response. The Chinese restaurant waiter will ignore you when you come in and ignore you when you leave. She won't come unless you call her. The only time she takes the initiative is when you are looking for a chair and she gives you the pad to order. The legendary rocking boat check-in is not provided proactively and will be delayed until you no longer want it. In short, the service in this hotel is not even at the level of a farmhouse. But the guy who drove the limousine was pretty good, the only quality in the service. The breakfast is poor for a thousand-yuan hotel, not to mention the service. Not recommended unless you just want to live in a big city.

msg:The room is very large, the natural environment is also very good, there are many mosquitoes, and the hygiene of the room is average. First of all, I checked in after 3 o'clock. There is still scale on the wall of the bathroom that has not been removed. There are cobwebs in the corner of the bathroom. There is a strange smell in the house The smell, later the hotel cleaning said it was because of the smell of disinfectant, since we checked in just after the room was cleaned, the smell didn't dissipate. The room service for dinner tastes good, but we didn’t even give us a bowl or plate, so it’s difficult for 3 people to share the meal, and the notice said to clean up after eating, but the tableware and leftovers were taken away. Didn't even wipe the table. There is a shower on the first floor, but it is not equipped with toiletries. This is also very confusing. The hair dryer is a no-name hair dryer with a loud sound and very violent vibration. It is unbelievable that a hotel at this price is equipped with such facilities, and it is not as good as an express hotel. There are not many types of buffet breakfast, and the juice is not freshly squeezed. In the end, there was no welcome fruit in my package. I also asked the butler on the night of check-in. The butler said that it would be delivered later, but it was not delivered in the end. When I checked in, he said that someone would contact me from the travel photography, but in the end there was no. In Taobao, only Sea World has been there, and I have never experienced the others. In short, the natural environment is very good, but the service cannot keep up, so it is not recommended.

msg:The Ctrip confirmation stated that check-out was at 14:00, but the hotel said that check-out was at 12:00 during the National Day holiday. Later, they said they would take care of my check-out at 13:00, and then I begged him instead. The room rate of 3,500 per day only gives you 21 hours. The key is that many rooms are still empty. I checked in at 15:00 and asked to add some necessary items. I had to wait three or four times before they were delivered at 22:00, and several items were still missing. Positioning itself so high-end, but the service does not feel high-end at all. I would also like to remind the tourists behind me that rowing the oar boat is more dangerous. When we boarded the boat, it tilted very badly. When we got ashore, we saw the crew tilted and fell into the river. We were very scared, as if the person who fell in was an old man who was traveling with us. The consequences are unimaginable. Finally, I would like to advise Song Pin to do what he is capable of doing, otherwise he will not be able to do it for a long time.

Disadvantages: 1. I don't know if it is Chinese New Year or what, the hotel has very few service personnel, there is no guidance from the hotel to the lobby, and there are no security personnel.
        2. Breakfast is not eaten at the hotel. It is eaten at the same group's Schberger. They share a restaurant. The meals are really very, very ordinary. The waiter and auntie at the coffee machine are really blunt and impolite. At one time, an aunt asked two more sentences and answered very bluntly. Thinking about it, it would be sad if my mother was answered so bluntly and bluntly during the Chinese New Year.
Overall, the service environment and hardware facilities of the hotel itself are pretty good, and I will stay again next time

The tall and empty living room and the well-decorated big bed made the children scream frequently. I was deeply impressed by the hotel service. The housekeeper Eva liao added WeChat before we checked in, and provided us with perfect services for our check-in requirements, boat arrangements, travel suggestions, etc., especially in the evening when Sunac Mao was on his way back for help. She also arranged a battery car for us to pick us up at the place closest to the hotel from the shopping mall, so I won&#39;t go into details. The warm smiling faces of every hotel staff, such as the uncle who picked up the battery car, Aunt Cui Lixia who cleaned up the room, and the enthusiastic grandma who rocked the boat, all made people feel at home. Praise for the hotel, will come again.

msg:The hotel sucks! ! I have never stayed in a resort hotel at this price with such poor service! ! First of all, there is no introduction for such a large resort hotel, and it doesn’t take the initiative to provide a boat check-in service. I only found out about this by reading Xiaohongshu myself! The second waiter is like a ***, everyone asks three questions and doesn't even know where the parent-child amu*****t park is. Thirdly, apart from the addition of new slippers, the room cleaning does not show that it has been cleaned at all, and the garbage is not thrown away! And bug corpses! ! Fourth, the hotel is very deserted, there is no one, and there are no waiters, and the swimming pool restaurant is closed, so you have to go to the hotel next door to eat! The most irritating point is that after checking out, I paid 1,500 yuan for pre-authorization for no reason. There was no bill and no phone call. I received a deduction text message and called to ask. My God, what price do you have for the hotel? ? There is such a low-level mistake. I suggest that you really don't come, it can make you angry.

We arrived at the hotel at three o'clock and were told that we would not be able to check in until five o'clock. We called the manager at 4:30, and even upgraded us to a lake view room, and then it took another half an hour to wait for the bus. After arriving at the room, we put our luggage Without a car, I went to the lobby to watch them swim. The swimming was too cold, and it took more than half an hour to come out and pay the bills. The staff were all interns, and they couldn't do it well. All the restaurants in the hotel are stopped, and when you go out to eat at night, you have to wait for the bus. I came back at 90 o'clock to prepare for a rest, and it was the first time I saw the toiletries with long hair and mildew. Under the sink is also full of dust and cobwebs. Breakfast needs to go to the next door. We spent more than 200 breakfast meal signs to see the scene of waiting in line for breakfast at ten o'clock.
The Wu Peng boat in the package didn't even get to sit, only one piece was worn, and they had to wait. Such service and hygiene are really annoying. It's a pity that this environment and hardware, my daughter is allergic to the skin, and the hotel has nothing to say!

The maintenance of the hotel is extremely poor, the yard is overgrown with ****s, the river is full of algae, the corpses of various insects on the sofa, and the mottled dirt on the carpet. The housekeeper may be very busy and very slow in replying to information. Because of sanitary problems, the house was changed and there was no fruit. I told him at four o'clock and he said that it would be delivered afterwards. After nine o'clock in the evening, it still didn't go back to the hotel. In the end, it was all gone. I didn't bother to talk about it anyway. The western restaurant is closed, and the set menu and afternoon tea will be eaten at another hotel in Wanda Jiahua. Of course, the quality is degraded a lot, there is almost nothing to eat, and there is no view. The table next door is also in the same hotel and complained about the poor quality of the breakfast. The hotel ordered bicycles to ride, but told us that the bicycles were maintained. I heard that the hotel stopped for a month in August because of the epidemic. I think if the consumption is downgraded to this level, it is really not open, and the first good impression will be completely destroyed, which is too disappointing.

msg:划船入住江南水鄉別墅的詩意之旅🌿
無錫雪浪宋品酒店，一家將江南水鄉的別墅與現代酒店設施完美融合的場所，為遊客提供了一種別樣的住宿體驗！
🌈位置：無錫濱湖區融創文旅城1號
自駕比較方便
距無錫新區站駕車距離16.7公里
距無錫站駕車距離20.3公里

設施：
23棟別墅，77間套房，每一棟都保留原有的建築風格，古色古香，充滿詩意，現代化設備一應俱全，洗護歐舒丹，還有咖啡機。

服務：
管家服務，酒店的員工都非常熱情友好，提前會加好WX，詢問入住喜好！尤其是賓客關係經理林嘉華，超級nice，專業五星級的服務，樂意為我們解答任何問題，並提供各種幫助！耐心細緻入微地關注客人的需求！

Tips：因為酒店別墅樓層高，樓梯多，房間在二樓，不建議推薦不便的長者或者行走困難的長者選擇單卧別墅！
早餐感覺一般般，衹有一碗牛腩麪覺得還可以，咖啡機要選擇麪檔對面的那個，選擇餘地多！

環境其實也可以達到5分，但維護感覺明顯不夠。宋品要做高端的話這方面還是要加強，不過就這個風格的來説維護是大問題，投入估計得挺大的，五一來説客流還可以吧，但平時應該入住率不高。
阿姨打掃衞生應該挺累的，這個一間房的工作量是其他酒店的三四倍。所以角角落落要很乾凈基本是很難的，這個做的我覺得已經很可以了。

優點：
1、環境是真的美 酒店很大 全都是獨棟小別墅 大大的荷花池 夏天很美 可以乘船入住 景色也很古鎮的感覺
2、有電瓶車 去房間不用走路 除了前台辦入住的不行 其他服務人員 都態度很好 也有求必應
缺點
1、蟲子真的太多啦 太嚇人 特意和前台説 入住前消殺一下 答覆説消殺過了 可是一到房間就看到二衹 打電話又叫人來消殺的 感覺前台就是信口雌黃
2、前台辦入住的很不專業 拿着身份證好久 還給我後才想起來沒做人臉識別 又重新要過去 人臉識別後就説入住辦理好啦 就去給下一個人辦理了 姐都震驚了 第一次遇到不給房卡的 要自己要房卡的
並且已經説了 要箇中間的房間 不要太邊上 結果就隨手給個房卡 好遠的 把住客説的話當耳旁風 集團管理和培訓太差
3、號稱五星級酒店 大堂門口沒有門僮 也沒人拿行李 進到大堂還要自己找 前台在哪裡 前台和正常酒店也不一樣 在一個角落裡 也沒人引導
4、早餐品種很少很少 品質也很一般 
總之和價位不符 管理 專業度都需要和國際五星級度假酒店好好學習學習

酒店旁邊就是融創樂園，有商場、孩子玩的地方、還有夜市，很熱鬧，購物很方便！
總體很不錯！
特此感謝管家龔玉龍

在此特別感謝張汝蘭張姐，林麓小哥哥和龔玉龍管家為我們帶來的美妙體驗，待到荷花盛開之際一定會考慮再次入住。

整個酒店非常大，坐電瓶車去房間也得要一會的。酒店人流量不是很大，服務員數量太少了，幾天住下來，基本臉熟。前台接待的小龔（可能寫錯，是工的讀音）很熱心的，服務也很到位，諮詢了幾家飯店也推薦的特別好。電瓶車的師傅服務也特別好。房間是一棟棟別墅，白天可以預約坐船，對小朋友來説是一種不錯的體驗。
客房打掃有改善空間，設施也有些老化了。
總體來説，還是很適合帶長者孩子居住的，節假日略貴。順便提醒大家，以後儘量不要在攜程“代理”這裏預訂酒店，發生售後問題解決起來真心麻煩。

酒店環境不錯，室外很安靜的一個酒店，因為下雨沒有做成搖櫓船入住，不管工作人員服務態度都不錯。
因為房間有些問題，值班經理解決的也很及時。服務本來是五分，少打一分是因為早餐。擺渡車拉到旁邊酒店去吃早餐，有專屬區域，然後進去就沒人管了，沒座位，沒座位啊，有種小學罰站的感覺。
房間內設施很齊全，但是因為入住正好趕上降温，房間內空調聲音即使調小風量也很大，一晚上沒睡踏實。換個取暖器可能比空調好。

2、沒有任何酒店配套的相關介紹 包括minibar的使用是否收費（預訂介紹裏面也沒提到） 
3、購買的套餐內 晚餐應該是西餐 但是莫名其妙把我們帶去了隔壁一家酒店的自助餐廳 而且去了之後基本沒有吃的 （我們小聲吐槽了幾句 大概是被大堂經理聽見了 就詢問我們是不是要額外煎點羊排給我們吃 這點還是很感謝的）
4、自助餐的刺身蘸料碟子沒有了 問服務員要 回答道：都被吃飯的拿完了 所以沒有新的 我真一臉懵逼。。。這什麼理由？
5、就跟check in一樣 check out也沒有人接待 就看着我呆站着等前面一對情侶辦入住 聽見女孩子期待的話語 我衹能説祝你們好運

總結一下：這是一家硬裝十分勉強五星的酒店 但是軟服務也衹能跟全季劃等號

msg:酒店環境一流，硬件尚可，但作為宣傳中的六星級酒店以及其價格，完全與住店體驗不符。
首先，作為一家定位高端的別墅型酒店，竟然連空調問題都無法解決，一樓温度尚可，但卧室所在的二樓熱的讓人無法忍受，而酒店的處理方式僅僅是提供噪音巨大且效果一般的冷風機，導致晚上小孩多次熱醒，差評！
其次，僅僅能提供嬰兒床，小童加床竟然要500/晚，性價比極低！
再者，作為別墅酒店，進出交通不算方便，效率一般。
除此之外，酒店內部環境還不錯，早餐也符合標準，但管理及基本的空調問題，以後肯定不會再考慮。

再説説加分項吧，酒店硬件沒啥可以挑剔的，環境特別好，管家服務也是迅速周到。十分感謝酒店幫忙佈置了客房😀
綜合扣分項和加分項，我們可以給這家酒店滿分😊已經推薦給朋友們了，我下次還會選擇這家。

管家服務，管家是見不到的 衹有微信聯繫。明顯不足， 發消息很久回 ，可能節假日太忙。
坐船除了第一次入住有， 後面都回答預約滿 ，好不容易約好了 ，銜接服務疏漏，造成忘記 等了很久，  這個服務啊！
最要吐槽的是酒店中餐廳 ，比小店都不如 廚師完全不會做菜， 不是鹹就是食材不新鮮， 沒有點餐衹能套餐好吧， 點了3k套餐 5人用 ，結果滿桌菜全都浪費 沒有一個菜好吃的 完全和酒店品質不符合 ，投訴菜不新鮮 ，沒回復  ，明顯餐廳經理是敷衍的，  服務啊
聽説酒店要賣了， 人心渙散  ，門口禮賓也沒啦 房間打掃馬虎 ， 到處感覺都是懶散
希望品牌酒店保持品質 期待改進 酒店環境不錯 3k一晚 希望能感受到服務品質

酒店整體很舒適，房間夠大，院子也很私密，唯一缺點就是疫情期間餐廳不能點餐衹能選套餐，希望儘早恢復，還會選擇二次入住。

漫步在景區小道，悠閑又自在，因為疫情文華自帶的餐廳，健身房未能開放稍顯遺憾，勝在服務到位，出入有接送車。贈送的騎行體驗管家也貼心幫忙變更為小孩子的自助早餐，超六星的體驗，強烈推薦。

最後有個小插曲，按金1000扣除早餐應該是800多退回，原來説24小時內退回，結果等了2天還沒退回就諮詢了，應該是財務忘了操作？還好最後打電話退了

msg:一家三口，國慶，入住五天，河景單卧，雙卧都住過，雙卧更高級點兒，酒店環境可以，周邊小孩玩的融創樂園推薦去，酒店服務不合格。

進酒店地下停車場底盤低的車一定要非常慢，不然一定會被刮底盤。

我抱着小孩還需要拿行李，酒店門口沒有門僮幫忙，一個人都沒有。

進到大堂後禮賓部兩個人在看手機 看到我仍然看手機。我抱着孩子上前詢問前台在哪才引領去。

前台小哥為我開好房間後衹告訴我房號和早餐時間，早餐在哪 酒店簡介 什麼都不提，問他桌子上的融創樂園相關宣傳活動海報，也都不知道。

入住後桌子上放的水果不配刀叉，下午5點告知管家需要刀叉 寶寶洗護等的東西，直到晚上21:30還沒送來，又催了管家後10:30才送來一部分東西，過了一個小時才有人來告知今天無法配送刀叉，這一個小時小孩一直在等刀叉想要吃水果，沒有也不早説。

入住期間有兩次開着請勿打擾時，一次深夜被咚咚咚敲門，一次白天阿姨直接進入大門-花園-走到客廳這裏大喊要不要打掃。

睡覺時一樓有設備會發出噠噠噠的聲音把我吵醒。

管家不瞭解周邊融創茂和融創樂園的位置並誤導，還説酒店接人的電瓶車可以開到外面的大馬路上送我去樂園…開車的師傅聽到都驚呆了…哈哈哈，管家是有多無知？

早餐的麪和餛飩很難吃，壽司的米是硬的夾生的，接牛奶豆漿下面那個碟子裏的奶都要撲出來了也沒人擦，粥和盛穀物旁邊經常沒有碗和勺子。

用完早餐想回房間整個大堂和門口一個服務人員都找不到。

房間的地很臟，住了五天馬桶旁邊從來沒有擦乾淨過…一直都是男士的尿液印在那裡。打掃的阿姨今天忘了放潤膚露，明天忘了放糖包，後天忘了放茶包。

酒店有個後門去劇院很方便，但是那條小路能不能也請人打掃一下，旁邊的植物檔路，我們第一天從那走推開門的腳下就有一坨類似粑粑的東西，第二天它被紙板蓋上了，第三天第四天它有一點幹了，第五天紙板和粑粑還是在那。

這是我第二次入住文華。也是最後一次。不想再給他機會了。
隔壁的嘉華和皇冠也都住過，再讓我選一次，綜合性價比，我選嘉華。

我主要想吐槽幾點，第一是服務，check in的時候服務員跟我説我是雙卧的別墅，費用已經付款，讓我簽單，我給出預訂告知是單卧而非雙卧，服務員就開始糾結了，讓我乾等着，他一個電話一個電話確認，我提示説你可以給我個單卧，其餘事情你們後面自己後台操作就好了，果斷拒絕，讓客户乾等。很無語。第二點想吐槽的就是衞生，衞生並沒有達到印象中五星的概念，別墅雖然大，但是房間還是能看到有灰有蜘蛛網，對於我這個潔癖來説，心理壓力賊大。吐槽第三，作為超五星級酒店，沒有充電樁，很雞肋。
應該不會二刷。
