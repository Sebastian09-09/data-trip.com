msg:Everything in regards to our stay at the Grand Hyatt was 6* except for the WiFi which wasn't of international standards.

Location was spot on a central network linked to the mall with major big brands 
Which is linked to the 1st class train system. 
It's also 30mins walk to the Forbidden city.

And the gym üèãÔ∏è‚ôÄÔ∏è  and Pool and Spa was simply immaculate and luxurious first class with a heated pool oasis. Wished I could have spent more time enjoying the facilities.

And what complimented well to the global luxurious brand was it's staff members!

I have to call out the exceptional 2 departments 
Conceige and Housekeeping which was truly above and beyond!!!

Daniel -assisted with restaurant bookings and forbidden City tickets reservations. And when he was off duty he still wechat me to suggest how to maximise the use of our tickets and best way to maximise time to visit Tianamen Square too and tips too on best way all this while he was off duty!
Such dedication!!!

Another staff whom I like to recognise is Cecila also from Conceige. When asked for directions on day 1, she didn't just verbalise, she left her station and ushered us all the way outside and showed us the right way around to our breakfast destination.

On day 2, which is also check out day, she realised its 
J birthday and made arrangments for not 1 but 2 bakes so that our dearest friends could enjoy together too. She also kept in touch on wechat to organise all our logistical arrangments several times. Each time with a üòÉ smile. Outstanding!

Housekeeping lady for rooms 1221 and 1220 was simple though and detailed and went above and beyond too. So much personal touch to all that she did which most would never bother!
Good job!! And best of all, she didn't expect anything in return. Absolutely admirable! Unsung hero!

Check in staff Allan was pleasant and swift with our late check in and made our final day breakfast logistics seamless. Thank you and thanks for responding efficiently on wechat too.

Con- WiFi sucks badly.....surprised that a 5* global brand couldn't keep u to. Chengdu 4* service Residence. So frustrating for global travellers like ourselves.

Hope the next time we stay here sky guo would have fixed this feedback! Alongside with ensuring that luke warm pre made coffee will not be served.
Absolutely charming sales director

msg:I thoroughly enjoyed my stay in the Grand Hyatt. The staff were polite and helpful, and the room was comfortable and clean. The pool was beautiful, although very cold. We also had great service in the balcony restaurant on Saturday night. In particular, a young waiter called Jesse was very helpful and made our dinner very relaxing. 

The breakfast the next day was alright. Plenty to choose from and tasted ok, but the service was not as good. It seemed like they were short staffed on some stations. There was only 1 person on the toast/waffle/pastry counter and she was trying to bake, cook a waffle, and refill a fruit bowl on the cereal counter at the same time. We also had a waitress in a darker blue uniform who was so angry looking and rude. She took away our cutlery every time we finished something and never replaced it, so we had to ask for more which seemed to inconvenience her. She went to get me a knife and fork and almost threw it down on the table saying "here." She then started cleaning up a table opposite us and was banging the chairs into the table disturbing my baby and myself eating.  

I appreciate that it gets busy in a buffet style restaurant, but working in retail means providing service with a smile regardless of how under pressure you are. 

Overall an enjoyable stay.

Downstairs is Oriental New World. It is only a 5-minute walk from Wangfujing Street. There are subway stations on both sides of the hotel, Line 1, Line 5, and Line 8, which are convenient for transportation. You can stroll around Wangfujing Pedestrian Street at night.
This time, I would like to thank the handsome Zac at the hotel front desk for helping me upgrade the room in advance. The room is comfortable, exquisitely decorated, and fully equipped. The brand of toiletries is excellent. My husband likes to drink tea very much. The tea set provided in the room is also tall and stylish. You can see the street view of Chang'an Avenue outside the window.
The hotel's Western restaurant has a variety of varieties. The environment, dishes, and service of the Chinese restaurant Chang'an No. 1 are all good. My husband and I tasted their roast duck. One word-awesome üëçüèª, just in time to buy a box of zongzi gift box üéÅ to take home during the Dragon Boat Festival.
I forgot to take a photo of the picnic bag sent by the hotel. There are a lot of things. Two people took half of it and it was just right to eat on the way to the Great Wall. It was so thoughtful.

It was not cramped even with an extra bed for my baby. There were welcome fruits every day. I was very happy to get a red panda because I stayed longer!

msg:I missed the high-speed train, so I booked this hotel temporarily. The front desk and room service were very good. But to be honest, when checking in at the lobby, the child mistakenly entered the lobby bar. Because it is open, there was no waiter at the door. As a result, the waiter did not explain to the child, but directly drove the child out like a chicken. It was not handled properly. The hotel room is standard, but the table in the room is glass, and you need to pay special attention to the right-angle edge when you bring children. The location is good, and the Qiaodongbei restaurant next door is also good.

In addition, I was surprised and pleasantly surprised that the catering, whether it is the executive lounge or the Balcony on the 2nd floor, is very attentive. The lunch buffet even has tiramisu. I must give a big thumbs up to the catering depar**entüëçIt is the best catering I have ever lived in, and no meal is a mess.
The room I stayed in was newly renovated. Although the floor height is not high, it does not affect it.
The service staff, from the cleaning aunt to the catering service, took the initiative to ask, but some waiters were too diligent in collecting plates during meals. But the whole hotel is very proactive.
When you forget to bring a swimming cap when swimming, you are not asked to buy a new one. You can use the old one for the time being. Everything is based on the perspective of the guests.
Except for the staff at the front desk who are not familiar with the details of the Ctrip package, you must give full marksüíØ

Wangfujing was next to it, so it was nice to take a walk after dinner. The service staff was very enthusiastic, and Zac at the front desk was very considerate. He asked about things that needed to be paid attention to one day in advance, arranged the room reasonably and provided the pillow I liked. When I just checked in, I didn't know the difference between the east and west stairs, so two guys helped to send me to the room. It was a perfect trip, the only shortcoming was that the breakfast was a bit monotonous. In addition, the room can see the Forbidden City, the White Pagoda and Jingshan

When traveling with the elderly and children, it is very convenient to arrange two adjacent rooms. After a little reminder, I also gave gifts to the children, and the children were very happy.
The only thing is that the hotel has newly renovated guest rooms. It is said that the space design is more reasonable, and the hotel does not proactively inform, prompt or display. So after we checked in, all our luggage had been scattered, and we didn't want to upgrade or change rooms at all. But after all, the old room was really old, and the wallpaper was a little peeled off.

This time, I was a family of four traveling with my children. I chose a parent-child themed room in the apar**ent. The living room is very large, with sofas, coffee tables, and dining tables. Stove, large refrigerator, microwave. There are two bedrooms, one double bed and two single beds. The bedding is very comfortable and I slept well.
Service: Tina, the manager at the front desk, is very good. If you have any questions, you can send her a private message and she will be solved quickly every time. She bothered her many times during the process. She took things, delivered things, and parked the car. She was able to serve patiently and meticulously without being impatient. New Year's Eve I also prepared a small gift for the upcoming season, like it!
Transportation: Next to Wangfujing, Oriental New World is downstairs and can be directly accessed from the subway station.
Facilities: The hotel facilities are above the standard. It is an established five-star hotel after all. The swimming pool is very good but I didn‚Äôt bring a swimsuit so I didn‚Äôt try it. The hotel specially sent some extra children's toiletry sets. Because it is a themed room, there are many little dolls and the children are very happy and surprised!
Catering: The breakfast is very good. We have upgraded to the executive lounge breakfast. Although there are not too many types, everything is exquisite.
Hygiene: The room is also very clean and tidy

There are only a handful of advantages: check-in and check-out are very polite, the New Year's Eve lottery is also very interesting, and it is convenient to go to Oriental Xintiandi, just down the escalator from the lobby. The breakfast and dinner service in the Grand Club is good. The glass is a bit dirty, so I tried to take a picture of the window grilles, but the water stains behind it ruined the scenery!
Numerous shortcomings: The housekeeper is in name only, but is actually a shift receptionist with extremely poor problem-solving skills! With poor coordination skills, having a housekeeper like Chloe makes it impossible for guests to stay at ease! The room was extremely unclean in the next two days. The male waiter was careless. There was a lack of cups today and soap tomorrow. He didn't remember to return the kitchen sink to its original position after cleaning. Should the guests be allowed to reach out and pull out the stopper themselves? ? ? The bathtub was not wiped, the foot bath bag used the day before was still on the edge of the bathtub, and the water stains were still there. The floor mats are not changed every day. I have already complained to the hotel exhausted. Can this be a Grand Hyatt? Are you worthy of the price of this brand? The Chinese New Year is causing trouble for people! Everyone, remember this Grand Hyatt Oriental, which is inferior to even a small county in the 18th tier!
In the past, when I went to small places like Wuyuan and Weihai, whenever there was a complaint, the housekeeper would be waiting for me at the door of my room the next day to reassure me, or the manager would be waiting in the lobby to apologize humbly! The Grand Hyatt Oriental butler didn't show up at all, let alone a manager waiting in the lobby!
The Ctrip platform has no binding force on hotels, so Ctrip is also unforgivable! "

After booking the Regency Suite, Vicky provided us with meticulous service with her professionalism and enthusiasm.
Before checking in, she took the initiative to contact us by phone and introduced the various rights and interests of the suite in detail to ensure that we had a full understanding of the accommodation environment. She also specially set up a check-in group for us to facilitate our communication at any time.
During our stay, Vicky always paid attention to our needs. She not only reminded us to participate in various activities in the hotel, but also made us feel happy and warm in this Year of the Dragon with her attentiveness and warmth. Her service not only improved our stay experience, but also made us feel the warmth of home. Like, like, like!

Vicky's warm and thoughtful service helped her arrange everything well. The room view is also beautiful. I contacted Vicky to extend my stay. Helped with arrangements. The weather in Beijing was so bad that my child had a nosebleed. When cleaning the room, he thoughtfully arranged a humidifier. The facilities are complete and the room is clean and luxurious.

The facilities are quite complete. The buffet breakfast has many varieties and tastes good. It is as comfortable as ever.
The location of the hotel is also good. It is next to Wangfujing. It takes more than 20 minutes to walk to the Forbidden City and 10 minutes to walk to Wangfujing. By taking the subway, you can go to Oriental New World Wangfujing Station without going out. Oriental New World and Wangfujing Pedestrian Street are both very convenient for eating and shopping. Convenient and suitable for southerners with sub-zero temperatures in Beijing.
The housekeeper Eloise is very considerate, proactively serving to meet individual needs, and also arranged afternoon tea, great review!

I arrived at the hotel at one o'clock, and they said that the room was not cleaned well, and they said they would urge me. As a result, half an hour later, the guests who checked in at the same time as me left, and I was the only one left. I went to ask the front desk, and was told that the normal check-in time was three o'clock and asked me to wait for an hour! They also said that our hotel has many other room types! What does this mean? It implies that I booked too cheap and don't deserve to check in first... I finally arranged a room, but it turned out to be a dangerous building! As soon as I entered the hotel room from the scenic spot, I saw the ventilation board hanging in the air. I complained to the front desk, and waited again, and was told to deal with other things! Isn't it for life safety, ordinary guests are only worthy of waiting! It's really an excellent hotel, and the board that is about to fall is attached for everyone to appreciate. After communication, I changed the room, but I was not very satisfied. The street view I wanted was gone, and there was a smell when I went in. Anyway, I'll just bear with it üòêFinally, after leaving the hotel, the prepaid fee was not refunded. Helpless üôÑÔ∏è I can only call the hotel again. As soon as I complained, I refunded it immediately! This is really the first time I have seen such a ** five-star hotel!

Because the air conditioner was noisy at night and my husband didn't sleep well, we asked to change the room the next day. The lady on duty at the front desk also helped us solve the problem and told us that if the view was not so good, we should change the room. Don't go and take a look before deciding, but my husband insisted on moving, but it turned out that the air conditioners in all rooms were relatively loud, so we had to turn them off before going to bed. The room facilities are relatively old and the toilet is not smart, which all deduct some points! But the hotel's catering is really great, the food is exquisite, including breakfast, executive benefits and Chinese food, the standard is very high! Thank you very much Tian. Due to the heavy snow, our high-speed rail flight was canceled. Tian immediately cared about us and prepared to arrange for us to extend our stay.

The view is great. , it is worth mentioning that the hotel swimming pool is very beautiful and unique, the facilities and equipment are complete, and the rooms are clean and tidy. I will choose this place again when I come to Beijing.

The concierge is the best among hotels in the same price range. Sona, the concierge management staff, and Elsa, who checked out, were very nice. They introduced the hotel in detail and gave good suggestions to customers who did not bring swimsuits and caps. Many people have praised the breakfast, the variety and quality are very good. Overall, Western food is better than Chinese food, especially pastries. And what must be praised is that the dishes are replenished very quickly, and it is rare that a dish is not eaten enough.

When I checked in, the manager on duty, Tiffany, was very enthusiastic to check me in and explained the room precautions. It was the concierge managers Cecilia and Daniel who came to Beijing to introduce me to the surrounding environment. They helped me plan the time in advance and called a car to set off. They allowed me to devote myself to the trip. I really like it. If I come back next time, I must stay at the Grand Hyatt Hotel.

Some of the hotel's facilities have been newly upgraded and renovated, making them luxurious without losing the characteristics of Beijing. From the design point of view, it is really very thoughtful.
Service: The front desk service is impeccable. This is what surprised me. The staff smiled, greeted me politely, and always found a way to solve the questions I asked. Especially Tiffany, Jessica, Cecilia and Eva are professional and meticulous.
Facilities: Complete facilities and very well maintained. It can be seen that the hotel has put a lot of effort into maintaining the facilities. After all, it is an old hotel for more than 20 years.
Hygiene: Hygiene is commendable. The room was spotless. The room attendants were all smiling and enthusiastic. They collected all my things and organized them well with a full sense of detail.
This is a very satisfying stay experience, and it is a good hotel that I would recommend to my family and friends.

üè®Grand Hyatt Beijing üè®
I have always been fascinated by this Oasis Club swimming pool. First, the underground swimming pool was blocked, and then it was renovated. Finally, I am looking forward to the return of the swimming pool. I quickly bring my children to experience it.
‚õ≥Ô∏èThe location is unique: right on Chang'an Street, with Oriental New World underground, next to Wangfujing, where you can find everything you need to eat, drink, and play, and next door is the famous Concorde
üë©üèªüíªCheck-in is Wingo, Pkg booked a double room + buffet lunch, the duty manager Domon directly gave us a double breakfast, a buffet dinner on the day of check-in, and let us choose dinner or lunch, and delayed check-out the next day! Check-out is Allan, who arranged a 24HüÖøÔ∏è100 meter discount
üõñThe most common double bed room is relatively old, but very clean. The large mirror only has more than 10,000 photos~ I saw a friend next door sharing that the guest room has been updated. It would be better if I could be assigned a new room. Grand Hyatt does not have a bed rail, but a crib is provided
üèäüèªI mainly came here for the swimming pool of the Oasis Club~two small hot spring pools, an infinity pool, and a shallow water part, which is very friendly to children, and there is also a waterfall‚Å∞Ã∑Ã¥ÕàÍí®‚Å∞Ã∑Ã¥Õà~It‚Äôs a pity that the lighting can‚Äôt capture its beauty. , anyway, I will buy it again for the oasis swimming pool...
üçΩÔ∏èDinner and breakfast are all served at Jinger. For dinner, there are cheese-baked lobster and grilled oysters, but they are limited. I think other dishes are quite delicious. I think children will go crazy in the dessert area·ïë·ó¢·ì´

The height of the floor is such that I, a short southerner, can directly touch the ceiling light. It is not recommended for big people and those with claustrophobia. What is incredible is that in a hotel room with a price of 2,000 yuan, the free food and drinks in the room only cost 1 yuan, such as mineral water and instant coffee, and the cans of Coke in the refrigerator cost 30 to 41 cans! Fortunately, before I drank, I saw the QR code on the side and scanned it, and a price list popped up. I quickly put it back and ordered takeout. I also wore hotel slippers to have breakfast one morning, but the waiter stopped me and didn't allow me to wear slippers into the restaurant! What a Michelin-required Syrian service for guests! üôÇ

Positive comments about the front desk staff
Good reviews for the buffet staff on the second floor
The negative reviews for the service staff at the west side water bar on the first floor of the hotel are quite negative. It is recommended to cancel the west side water bar on the first floor. It hurt my family and I was almost late to take the high-speed rail.
I am very dissatisfied with this service staff and suggest the hotel fire this person.
I paid for the pastries and drinks after I ordered them. The waiter said that I could pay after I finished my drinks, so I said I should pay them first! When the car I called came to pick us up, the service staff refused to let us go. He said that the system didn't see it! ! ! ! She didn't believe it even after showing her the WeChat records, so she wouldn't let her leave anyway. Thinking about it, she was really pissed off, so angry!
I spent nearly RMB 6,000 on a two-night stay at the Grand Hyatt Hotel, but could I afford a difference of RMB 244 in drinks? This waiter is absolutely irresistible

As a result, when I checked in, I was told that there were no rooms (pipeline repair), and I was arranged to move into a newly renovated house. The smell was unpleasant, the room was depressing, the windows were small, and the floors were low. It felt like I had entered a Lilliputian country. Then the person in charge of the front desk said that they would give us a double bed room so that we could sleep in an extra bed. The administrators at the front desk and the guest house on the 17th floor couldn't stop lying (I asked to see the double room of the guest house where the pipes were being repaired). I checked the computer for a long time and couldn't find the room number. The overall service attitude was poor, and the room we were given was also very poor. There was insufficient air conditioning at night, the smell of cigarettes poured into the room, and there was no welcome fruit. I stayed at this hotel before the epidemic, and the executive breakfast English-style poached eggs left a good impression. Now I guess the chef has changed. I waited for half an hour and I didn‚Äôt know what I got, and no one knew how to cook it. Very bad and extremely disappointing. There are big problems with the management.

msg:The hotel's catering service is very good. The western and mid-point tastes are online, the juice is freshly squeezed, the service is very good, the leadership is orderly, and it is at the level of Grand Hyatt.

The location of the hotel is very good. It is very convenient to call an online car-hailing car at the door. Basically, you can call it anywhere. It is very convenient to bring children and the elderly. It is impossible to call a car to go to Tiananmen Square, but there is a big step down from the entrance of the hotel to the 120 bus stop, and one stop is the Tiananmen security checkpoint, which is absolutely perfect. The concierge recommended me to go, but we took the bus with our family. It is also difficult to take a taxi when returning to the Forbidden City Shenwumen, but there are also direct buses, and the road is really not much to walk.

However, the room is not big, and it is a bit stuffy, and the air conditioner is adjusted to 18 degrees without cooling down.

A hotel with more than 2,000 yuan is probably Atour level.
The entire corridor was filled with a damp "hotel smell" and was not soundproofed.
It‚Äôs understandable that the decoration is old, but the TV is also low-definition which is very exciting.
The air conditioner cannot adjust the temperature, and it freezes to death even if it is turned off.
Parking is pretty good. It's quite weird not to provide parking discounts. When I asked about parking, when I checked in at night, the front desk said that it was 100 yuan for a 24-hour parking coupon. Then the lobby said that you don't need to buy it if you don't have 24 hours to use it. As a result, Check out at noon, parking fee is 174.
Although I just chose one within walking distance because I was running errands nearby, I wanted to find a place that was nearby, but I didn‚Äôt expect that I got slapped in the mouth.

Generally speaking, the hardware facilities of the room are still flawed, but the service attitude is very good and the location is good. Downstairs, No. 120 can go directly to Tiananmen East and Tiananmen West. Less walking than the subway. The water coming out of the faucet in the room is milky white, and it needs to stand for a while to become clear. Southerners really can't understand it. The breakfast is not rich and does not change every day. Although it is a buffet, seats will be arranged to save guests from the embarrassment of finding a seat by themselves. After all, it is a holiday and there are still many people.

Let me talk about the decoration first: the entrance and the lobby are all standard. The room is really amazing. I booked a twin room. The room is old and dilapidated. The room type is extremely small and the water quality is extremely poor. The waiter explained that the problem is caused by air bubbles. You guys Look at the picture, no matter how common sense you know, this is a water quality problem caused by too much bleach and insufficient filtration! The bedding is very hard, there is no five-star bedding standard at all, I asked the room depar**ent for a high pillow, but the room depar**ent brought dirty pillows, the experience is extremely bad!
Service evaluation: The room change service was ordered in the morning on the 30th, but the room was not changed when I came back at night. The front desk didn't know it at all.
I have lived in Grand Hyatt so many times, this is the most disappointing time, I will not choose Beijing Grand Hyatt in the future, bad review

No matter the front desk, the guest room or the restaurant, the service is really good, and the food is also very good. The quality of the swimming pool can not be used for a long time, but I am still very satisfied with traveling with my baby.
I still haven't figured out the administrative corridor. I feel that there are few service personnel in this part, the efficiency is relatively slow, and it takes a long time to confirm something.
There is a problem, it is no problem to need a special person to scan the code to measure the temperature, but it is unnecessary for this special person to make it as if he is an epidemic prevention depar**ent. The people at the door don't talk about helping out. If the guests are not helping with luggage, if the concierge is not there, then bear with it. But what does the person who scans the code mean when he says "hey hey hey" to the guest, and he has to cooperate with the attitude of damage. The attitude towards several waves of guests is relatively poor.

msg:Ctrip has basically never written a review, but Junyue must write to others to avoid lightning. The pre-sale purchased at 919, after the exchange, was arranged on the 13th floor. If this room was newly installed in 21 years, it would be a lonely upgrade. The wardrobe is too small, the toilet is too close to the wall, and there is no usb at the head of the bed. The alarm clock given by the bedside is not electronic, and the sound of the second hand moving is very clear, so I can only dig out the battery. There are four buttons for the room air conditioner, there is no operation instruction, but it is not incomprehensible. I turned off the air conditioner when I was too noisy to sleep. It turned on by itself in the middle of the night. It started suddenly, the sound was loud, and if there was a cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, it was okay to send it away directly. After pressing it twice it turned off and after an hour of sleep it turned on again. The third time, I couldn't turn it off when it was turned on. At four in the morning, I called the front desk to call the engineering staff, directly adjusted the temperature to the highest, and turned it off, and told me to turn it up again if it was turned on again. The air conditioner in the hotel needs to be adjusted to 28.5 degrees. Why didn't I expect it, I slept less than three hours this night, which is very good.
For example, the door of the shower room is not tightly blocked, and the shoes are wet after going to the toilet, which is not important.
If you want to live in Wangfujing, Nuojin is next door, and if you want to live in Chang'an Avenue, please choose Park Hyatt.

Great hotel with beautiful lobby! The Oriental Grand Hyatt Hotel next to Chang'an Street where I stayed on August 16. At 12:30, the check-in time has not yet arrived, but because I have to go out to the Forbidden City in the afternoon, I have to put down my luggage. The beauty at the front desk is very literate. She checked the room and arranged the room at the first time, but it is still cleaning üßπ, I will come back in the afternoon to get the room, Carefully help us store our luggageüß≥! But when I came back at 17:00 in the afternoon, I said that I was still cleaning the first time. After two minutes of communication, I got the room smoothly. I hope it was a system misunderstanding, otherwise it would be too ridiculous. Room x27, facing the fountain at the entrance of the lobby, the sunset and the night are very beautiful, the window can see the traffic flow on Chang'an Street and the building of the Ministry of Commerce opposite, which coincides with the white clouds and the red flags fluttering, praise!

msg:Bad experience hotel. I didn't expect that such a large chain hotel in the center of Beijing would have such an experience. Check-in at two o'clock on the first day will not let you in, you want us to wait. It was not easy to check in until three o'clock. (Wait for more than an hour) The promised four rooms are on the same floor. It becomes a promise that every two rooms are on the same floor. Finally, the actual four rooms are on different floors. And the room is huge. Does not match the picture. Hygiene is also general. In the middle of the night, the sound of the air conditioner in one of the rooms was also recorded. And the temperature and air volume can't be adjusted. After listening to the recording to the front desk, it said that it will be repaired for us the next day. After playing in the afternoon, I went back to the room and it was still not repaired. Another theory before changing the room
I left the room at 5 am the next morning. Back to the room after three in the afternoon. Actually the room was not cleaned. The front desk also said it might be because we pressed Do Not Disturb. It turns out that DND is not pressed.
Called to the room at 10 am on the fourth day and asked us to check out at 12 o'clock. Said to be 12 o'clock check out and two o'clock check in. We will not refund the next guest's occupancy. OK. Then why do we have to check in after three o'clock on the first day? Meal Theory agreed to give us a delay until half past one. As a result, we couldn't get on the elevator after 12 o'clock. Can't get into the room either. To the front desk and said that the provisions of 12 o'clock check out.
Room Coke 40 a can. Oh little can. Do you dare to drink, tourists?

The key point is to say that during the epidemic period, the measures were strict, and there were a lot of registered temperature measurement scan codes, which was very reassuring.
The only drawback is that it has been built for many years. Compared with the current five-star hotel, the equipment and facilities are a bit outdated. For example, the TV in the room is small in size, and there is no shower curtain in the bathroom and bathtub.

I have seen many people comment that the decoration is a bit noisy, and the room is a bit old
some worry
On the first day of the May Day holiday, a family of four stayed in a hotel, ready to watch the national flag hoist, and take an in-depth tour of the surrounding area
In fact, the children can't get up in the morning and don't see it as raising the national flag. However, there are very few people in Wangfujing Street and the surrounding alleys. It is a good experience with children.
I commend Chen Haitao, the deputy manager of the front office. The service is very good. Seeing that we have 2 children, we also provide free extra bed service.

However, the computer system was disconnected and the power was cut off. The entire front desk was unable to check-in. At this time, John comforted me and led me to the concierge.

There was no smell and it was very neat and clean. Let me focus on the bath water. It is flusher than before. Taking a hot bath after a busy day is so relaxing. I would like to praise our service here. Because I worked overtime late on the night of check-in, the meal included in the package was not included. It was just in time. The KIKO manager of the hotel and Regan manager of Changan No. 1 were very helpful in coordinating and kept the unused meal coupons for me. I would like to express my special thanks for being able to take the initiative to consider the guests and choose a good hotel to stay in. Not only choose the hardware part, but also the supporting services. I always choose this place to celebrate important anniversaries because I can get services that match the value every time.

As the entire hotel is partially decorated, the entire registration process is completed as soon as you enter the door, and there is not much space. The first floor is also surrounded by billboards.
But the attitude of the service staff is very enthusiastic, the concierge will take the initiative to guide you to the elevator, (the decoration is indeed more complicated), the front desk has arranged a room with a better view, but due to the decoration, there will be noise from 10 am to 6 pm during the day, so Friends who want to stay in the room during the day choose carefully...Lower floors are better.

Because it is also a veteran hotel, the hotel facilities are quite satisfactory, you can see the old and heavy look, but it does not affect the experience, welcome fruits and free mini bars are all standard! The mattress is very comfortable [strong] but the sanitary cleaning needs to be improved. The mirror of the room has obvious water patterns on the top. The scenery of the living room may be a problem with the wiring. The decoration needs to be carefully controlled. "Grand Hyatt Beijing"

This time I booked a double-bed suite. When I came here, because the room was not available yet, the beauty Salia at the front desk was enthusiastic and loving, and gave us an extra bed for free and a second gift. Breakfast of the day, a wonderful staying experience!

The large floor-to-ceiling windows and the street view of the fountain are all in sight. It is recommended to stay in Beijing. It is convenient to book a room and check in quickly. The luggage storage office can directly check out and deposit, and the efficiency is super high. The service staff will enthusiastically give directions wherever we go, travel more efficiently and enjoy the journey. We later retired when we booked other hotels and renewed our stay.

In order to facilitate the children to go to Tiananmen Square to watch the flag-raising ceremony of this hotel. The hotel lobby is being renovated, which will have a certain impact. The service can only be said to be average, not up to the level of a five-star hotel, it took half an hour to check in, and I called several times for ordering. The hotel may have been renovated for a long time. It is not modern enough and should be renovated.

I just waited for a long time for check-in this time, maybe it happened to be crowded at that time, I hope to speed up the check-in next time. The breakfast was moved from the 2nd floor to P2, the place seems to be not big enough, we need to wait.
Anyway, others are still very satisfied, and I will still live here next time I come to Beijing.

The intersection of Line 1 and Line 8 is enough to go to major attractions in Beijing. It is really convenient! The room service is also delicious. There is a special express cabinet for temporary storage when ordering takeout, which is convenient for eating various breakfasts in Beijing. Miss Mignon at the front desk took the initiative to add WeChat to contact. Although the reply is a bit slow, it is better than no reply. I hope to live in a newly renovated room next time!
