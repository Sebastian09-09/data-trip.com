msg:Very good, no need to leave the hotel at all, a perfect vacation trip.

💁♀️Service: Every service staff is very nice, two small details: 1️⃣ I forgot to close the car window, it was going to rain at night, the housekeeper reminded me specifically, and took the initiative to help me go to the parking lot to close the car window. 2️⃣ The hotel cluster is very large. We took a tour bus to visit the hotel. The driver will take the initiative to introduce the characteristics of each hotel, and will let us get off the car to take pictures and wait for us.

🏠Room: The room is super beautiful, what you see is what you get, there is a large sea of ​​flowers at the door, and there are heavy mountains in the distance. The supplies are very rich, providing steam eye masks, facial masks, makeup remover towels, etc.

☕️Food: The food can be called pig farming. Breakfast can be delivered to the room or go to the restaurant by yourself. There is afternoon tea in the afternoon 🫖, and supper in the evening, which are all very rich! You can also watch a movie at night 🎬.

🏀Activities:
1️⃣ You can feed turtles! This is really the first time I have seen them, and they are tortoises and elephant tortoises. It is really interesting. The elephant tortoises breathe like bellows, hahaha

2️⃣You can pick them. There are many banana trees in the hotel. You can eat them when they are ripe. There is also a mulberry tree at the door of our room. We pick a lot every day. They are very sweet.

3️⃣You can watch the sunset on a bamboo raft for free. It is really beautiful. You can also experience paddle boarding 🚣, which is very interesting.

4️⃣In the evening, we had a barbecue dinner at the Tugou Bar. The guests gathered together to chat, sing, and the children ran around.

5️⃣Maybe it was a holiday, and there were ‼ ️fireworks‼ ️🎆‼ ️, which was very beautiful.

I feel that the few days in Chongzuo are really happy. The temperature is very high during the day, and you can swim and row a boat. It is very cool at night. You can ride a bike, watch a movie, and occasionally see the mountains shrouded in clouds and mist.

msg:This is a small hotel designed and run by a few young people. It met all my needs for a hotel or travel accommodation, and it also got an additional surprise that I didn't expect!
The design is very local, with thatched roofs, rammed loess walls, and dead branches cut into stoneware jars, giving it an eternal beauty. It is better to say that there are bananas planted in front of and behind the house than in a banana forest. Several rooms are more accurate.
The hot eye masks and hydrating masks prepared in the room are heart-warming.
The black forest cake in afternoon tea is neither sweet nor greasy, silky and refreshing.
The temperature of Good Night Milk includes the temperature itself and the pitted red dates slices inside.
When I walked in, I asked the security guy at the door if the sugar cane growing in the courtyard was sugar cane. When I left the room, there were two of them standing at the door.
When we checked out, we actually received a tangerine as a gift from the front desk. It has thin skin, juicy and sweet taste, which is better than all kinds of tangerines bought in the market. The nearby farmer uncle said he grew it himself and gave it to us.
The hotel has excellent design and exquisite decoration, but most people are cold-hearted. You have to check in and check out at the door. This hotel has a rare combination of exquisiteness and warmth!
Like 👍!

msg:A typical internet celebrity hotel, good for taking photos, but a bit awkward in terms of location, not far from the surrounding famous scenic spots and county towns, there are no natural landscapes around the hotel, just a tributary of the Zuojiang River. There are too many human factors in the park, basically it is a resort, it feels more suitable for people living in surrounding cities to come and relax, for those who come to Guangxi specifically for tourism, they still prefer the natural scenery of Guangxi.
The hotel has a complete range of facilities, and the afternoon tea is not bad, not the kind of deal with things. If you come here for tourism, it is recommended to go to the county town for meals, which is cheap, special and delicious.

About some issues: 1. Go to several other famous hotels in Chongzuo, basically they will contact you the day before to ask about your needs, and there will be a housekeeper to communicate in advance. Here is a housekeeper added after checking in.
2. When eating breakfast, I found some problems with the service. The main plate on the breakfast table was basically empty, and the things I ordered would not be served without urging. There was no order at all, and whoever urged would serve. The whole park eats breakfast in one place, and people are very messy, and even have to fight for seats.
3. Many bicycles in the park are broken, and the shuttle bus in the parking lot basically picks up luggage, and you can hardly see it at other times.
4. There is no privacy when staying, because guests can walk around the park, and the glass is transparent, so you can either choose to draw the curtains in the room to not see the scenery, or choose to let the passing guests see you
Summary: Only hardware, the software is not up to par, no flaws, but no nostalgia, just come here to check in and take pictures for the first time, and I may not stay here again when I come to Chongzuo.

There is no place to eat near the hotel. It should be said that the commercialization of Chongzuo is not enough. I had a barbecue in the hotel. The price was less than 400 and the food was rich.

msg:I really regret using the budget of staying in Yuerongzhuang to go to Chongzuo to experience such an internet celebrity store.
Yes, deep down in my heart, it can only be positioned as an internet celebrity store. There is no connotation, only the appearance of putting on makeup and powder.

Let’s talk about hardware, supporting facilities and services first…
The appearance of the house matches that of the Internet celebrity, but the comfort level is actually not good. The decoration of the house is rough, and the facilities are also very sloppy. A small refrigerator is completely the standard of a fast hotel. Not to mention that the floors in bathrooms and showers are full of cracks.

The hotel basically has no transportation facilities. It should be more suitable for self-driving guests. However, as a short-distance transportation from the hotel to the nearby town, it is not considered. It is boring to have to wait for three meals in a place as big as your palm. By the way Look, the restaurant is outsourced and only sells Western food, so the prices are not affordable.

In terms of hygiene, the dotted stains on the toilet seat that were illuminated by the light may not be noticed, but they really disgusted me, so I had to use the disposable toilet mat that I brought with me (I can’t believe it costs more than 2,000 yuan a day). (Late hotel hygiene standards)

After looking at the complimentary red wine, I didn’t want to drink it, so I didn’t want it. Fishing in the Blackwater River is up to you whether you like to go or not. Afternoon tea consists of a small basket of grapes, cantaloupe and tomatoes, a few cookies and two glasses of juice.

Probably just a careless internet celebrity.

I have to say that the service from booking the hotel to leaving is the impression I have stayed in the B&B. Best of all, on the day of check-in, the housekeeper Aza will call to check the check-in time. At that time, we happened to be stuck at noon and couldn't book for lunch. The housekeeper will arrange for the hotel to provide us with simple pasta and porridge for free. This detail is also full marks! When I arrived at the hotel, Aza's housekeeper personally received the check-in, turned on the air conditioner in advance, and asked my aunt to clean the room and the pool for guests to use! All the waiters are also very simple. All the waiters, butlers, including the owner of the homestay, will make you feel at home. The details are controlled. I stayed for two days and was moved by everything arranged by the hotel. I know that we have children and afternoon tea. Time, actually arranged Ultraman's cake, instantly felt very warm and the children were very happy, not to mention the boss, all the blockbusters we shot were made by him! Children love Brother Aza the most. He has been accompanying us in kayaking, and met our needs at the first time, from lunch, afternoon tea, dessert before bed at night, and breakfast the next day. All the details are carefully prepared. We need to order dinner and tell the housekeeper he will help us arrange it in advance. There is also red wine. The two-day stay experience was very good. I really recommend it. ! Thanks to the staff who served us this time, especially the housekeeper Aza who has been accompanying us, and the amiable boss! Very thoughtful and meticulous, highly recommended! "See you in the wild" sincerely look forward to your next stay! !

msg:There are caves in the park, the environment and the room are not bad, and it is not bad to bring a drone over to take pictures when the weather is good. Go to the Blackwater River to play paddleboard and kayak at sunset, the secret is quiet. The taste of the restaurant is good, the grilled beef tongue is also good, and the steak is average.
Tips: Don't go to town to eat, it's not easy to find a restaurant with a door.

msg:I received an unexpected surprise on the first day of the May 1st holiday. When I stayed in Xipo, Jiangzhou District, Chongzuo, I saw it in the wild. From the moment I booked a room, my brother called to inquire about the check-in time and route guide. First of all, this hotel has a very good sense of design. It can be seen that the taste of the hotel is very good. Secondly, the hardware and software facilities of the hotel are very good, the hardness of the mattress is quite appropriate, and there are two types of pillows, down and cotton pillows for customers to choose from, which is completely five-star level. It was a very good stay. Next time I come, I will choose the room 13 that I have seen 😍 No matter how good the description is, it is not as good as the real picture…

樓頂有泳池可以游泳，可惜來的時候下雨，沒用得上，其次水上下午茶一定不要錯過，黑水河風景特別美，還有龜龜樂園，可以近距離接觸國家二級保護動物，體驗特別棒。
房間周圍種了許多綠植私密性不錯，另外園區還種了一些果樹，運氣好還可以體驗採摘。

服務：服務超讚，儘量滿足了我們各種各樣的需求。不僅早餐幫我們送到房間，因為飛機延誤被迫停留，也讓我們延遲了退房時間。

服務：服務這裏真的要給個大大大的贊！因為人少，客服小姐姐幫我們升級了房型，最主要的是由於我們對房間包含的免費項目不瞭解，玩了一個付費項目（我們玩的時候以為免費的），退房的時候被告知需付費，我們解釋了當時玩的時候真不知道需要付費，小姐姐得知這中間有誤會，馬上給我們算免費了，真的很貼心。早餐的時候我説想吃藍莓，結果沒想到餐吧枱的小姐姐給我們洗了一盤，還問我夠不夠~感動~希望這麼好的酒店真的要繼續好下去。

唯一不足就是傢俱和牆面的整潔維護，希望可以一直保持新新的狀態~

我們在這裏騎了自行車、坐了竹筏（超級推薦）、放了煙花、在採摘活動裏收穫了芭蕉和甘蔗、第一次釣了魚，來之前被工作累的身心俱疲，從崇左離開的時候感覺滿血復活，充滿活力！

特別感謝 既見 的工作人員，尤其是幾位小姐姐，人美氣質又好，待人熱情又友善，服務響應都超級迅速，正是由於她們出色的工作，我們的假期過的非常開心！在此衷心感謝你們！

服務：超級好！每個遇見的工作人員都會熱情打招呼，既見的小姐姐們尤其好😘！另外也要感謝耐心教我們釣魚的教練😄

環境：完美，黑水河景色真不錯。園區被芭蕉葉覆蓋籠罩，空氣都比城市裡清新太多了。

設施：園區有免費自行車，還有竹筏漿板等一系列水上活動。

兩個小小的建議：有些自行車的車座壞了，有的車座無法調節高低，有點不太方便，如果以後能維護一下就更好了。另外就是希望這裏的早餐能更豐富一點，這麼好的酒店和地理位置，值得更好更有特色的早餐選品。

總結：推薦！崇左是個好地方！

msg:選了既見野奢，其實在野宿集裏面幾個項目都不錯，都是互通的，可以去旁邊公共區域看看拍照都ok
首先謝謝升級了房間，本來是圓泡池那種，升級成可以遊兩步這種私人泳池，美中不足就是以為外面的池子可以泡温泉，秋冬可惜了
房間很大，設施都不錯，送了下午茶，點心不好吃但是水果好好吃，房間裏送的水果也很好吃，芒果好甜，晚上有香蕉牛奶，早餐不豐盛但是有清淡的粉和愛的咖啡
要説幾個項目的不同就是lobby樓上的泳池和距離河邊遠近的區別了，其他都差不多，既見距離河比較近，萬相距離河比較遠，西坡上面沒有泳池但是看日落超棒

衞生：很不錯，作為一家在親近自然的度假酒店，幾乎沒有蚊蟲在房間裏，連屍體的痕跡也看不到，浴缸也蠻乾淨的，衞生間和房間整體有三個香薰，味道對我是很重要的環節。

msg:我媽很滿意，這就夠我給五星了。
但是，我個人覺得一般。
1.崇左周邊比較引人的景點是德天瀑布，德天裏面景區300已經比較好的酒店了。市區內正常也是300左右，這個度假村價格按照麗世看一半，其他感人……性價比見仁見智
2.這裏麪的人很強調自己的設計裝修和四個獨立風格的民宿，我個人並沒有覺得它對我形成了什麼品牌力。好的設計首先要消費者買單市場接受才是好的吧，我又不學設計，又不是做裝潢的。對我而言就是找個地方呆一下
3.下午茶正常提供這服務的酒店，一般是用保鮮膜包着的，我去到的時候發現都是蒼蠅。虛有其表就是好看
4.提供了付費竹筏，景還可以，價格也還可以，就是吧這動動是電的，轟轟轟的我腦子疼，切頂上沒有遮陽設施
5.震驚我了 居然這個直火評分那麼高，一個麪一個喝的一個沙拉一碗湯，兩百多價格還可以，沒有收服務費，就是味道一言難盡，可以叫外賣送前台
6.不得不diss，據説這每個房間帶一個池，基礎的袋子裝着濕衣服都沒配，給了個垃圾袋…
7.冰箱配了兩瓶要起子開的氣泡水和橙子，然而房間內沒有開瓶器
8.聽人勸，坐遊船訂既見，喜歡游水這裏或者野白都可
注：有設計風格需有對品質很高要求的出門左轉去麗世，反正這些磕磕碰碰我都能接受，你們大概想想農村自建房裝修一下的感覺就是了

msg:心理價位1500左右，既見、西坡、野白在一起的，鐵了心不聽勸要來的朋友（我本人），真誠建議訂最便宜的就好了
2600帶券拿下本來覺得有點虧但畢竟是端午假期，比平常價格還低，不算殺豬盤了。活動選了釣魚，因為是免費的體驗還不錯，划船要899，這個船的投資回報率真的資本市場看了都要拜師
服務確實不專業，大家都看起來很耐心有熱情也淳樸可愛，但是培訓屬實不到位，剛一到擠牙膏才問出來基礎訊息也沒問全（如早餐、resort活動，酒店基礎設施）。最離譜是房間放了一個編織包裏面有把質量看着還不錯的傘，想着這個價位拿走沒啥問題吧（參考國際連鎖resort和一般海島的單體resort），裏面有個手寫的不明不白的紙條（看得出是為了客户體驗專門寫得不明白）；小紅書看了説這家性價比低，所以生怕其實不讓拿走，專門拎手裡沒裝箱，結果checkout等buggy的時候，果然要回去了，還專門問了傘是不是在房間，別拿走哦（背景是，端午三天廣西下了三天雨）
理解resort難做，也能看到努力和用心，但以後還是再努力點，配得上價位吧
衞生給低分因為確實細節不到位，馬桶圈上有水滴的污漬
放點好照片，釣魚雖然空軍了還是開心的

還有最重要的一點，這裏的地理位置對於機場相對友好，第一次來的小夥伴可以把它作為飛行或者高鐵前一晚的選擇

msg:交通：昆明南至南寧南4.5 h
南寧南至崇左南1h
崇左南打車至在野宿集50分鐘

第一次感受熱帶雨林風的民宿集羣
房子是圓形的建築設計
每個房子像一顆蘑菇
房間外面是鬱鬱葱葱的香蕉樹
還有植物景觀一步一景
能感受民宿老闆的用心設計
住這裏夏天應該也不會太熱

早餐需要去集羣的獨立餐廳吃
管家會提前準備好餐券
去前台領取

下午茶在竹筏上享受
這種體驗好新奇
管家會提前準備好
穿梭在黑水河
生態特別好
清晰可見的魚兒
落日時分
夕陽西下劃個皮划艇拍照很出片兒

因為植被茂盛大大提高了房間私密性
每個房間都是超大落地窗
窗外的芭蕉葉像一副巨幅油畫
如果雨天來
雨打芭蕉
躺在床上
應該也是別有一番風味
户外有泡池
這次沒有帶泳衣
拍照應該很漂亮

全程管家會加微信
有任何問題都會第一時間響應
推薦給好多朋友
下次再來
