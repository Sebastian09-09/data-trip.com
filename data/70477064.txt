It is great that this hotel does not allow smoking inside their facility (allowed outdoors only). Their gym is embarrassing but other than that, everything else seems nice. 

One thing that I am very disappointed about is that the photos of the Cozy Room (King Bed) has a river view. However, we did not have that. We had a full view of the buildings and streets instead.

My friend and I booked a twin city view room to share, but upon arrival we loved it so much we changed to 2 separate queen bed, river view rooms. The service was amazing, staff spoke English and were very helpful with us changing our booking. Breakfast was delicious, the spa is amazing and I even bought some of their spa oils to take home (spa oils and eye masks are provided complimentary in the rooms). Drinks in the mini bar are also free and refilled every day. Close to everything you want to see. Hotel even arranged a car for us to go to the rice terraces. Waimai is also delivered straight to your room. Perfect, will definitely stay here again.

msg:The last night before leaving Guilin!! I love the luxury experience
In the city of Guilin!! High-end feeling! Luxury feeling! It has everything!
The reception at the door is very professional and the service is very good! As soon as the car arrived, he came up to help open the door and carry the luggage. He is a very gentle and handsome guy!! 🤵The lady at the front desk also spoke softly, which was very comfortable to listen to~ This first impression is very good!! If there is something later, the room will be solved quickly by calling! Great efficiency!!
The decoration tone of the whole hotel and the lobby design are among the best in these hotels in Guilin. I like the infinity pool area on the first floor very much. It is also an area with a high rate of photos!!
The lobby has a large dome, which is really grand and fashionable.
The room has a full sense of space!! The design is modern, novel and advanced, and the lighting a**osphere is just right. We live in a river view room with a panoramic view of the entire Li River. The room is fully equipped. The bathtub is in the right position, and there are bath salts, bath balls, and electric curtains to provide privacy. It’s really comfortable to take a bath when traveling. The SPA on the third floor and the Chen Sky Bar on the top floor are their characteristics~ Chen Sky also has afternoon tea in the afternoon, depending on everyone’s needs. I think it’s more comfortable to go to the bar on the top floor after the SPA! ! The location is super good, about 10 minutes away from Guilin Railway Station, East and West Lanes, and Zhengyang Pedestrian Street. It’s very convenient to travel~ ▪️Name: Guilin CIAO Qiao Hotel ▪️Location: Building 610, Anxin Community, Xiangshan District

The design style of this hotel is very charming, simple and low-key, but quietly exudes a sense of luxury. Every design element of the hotel is carefully arranged, and it is full of romantic rituals. The location is perfect, located at the bridgehead of the Li River in Guilin, and you can directly see the beautiful scenery of the Li River and Chuanshan Park. In the afternoon, take photos and enjoy afternoon tea in the lobby bar, looking at the infinity pool and the Li River, the comfort is intoxicating. The sky bar on the seventh floor is even more unique. After dinner, make a cocktail and have a drink, and then enjoy a comfortable SPA, which is wonderful. The room is spacious and tidy, with aromatherapy, essential oils, bath salts, bubble balls, etc. It is really considerate.

The hotel is also equipped with a children's play area and a spa area, which is very suitable for family outings~
The rooftop bar has a large capacity and an outdoor viewing area. It is so cool to look at the river view, feel the breeze, drink and chat~
The room I chose this time is facing the river view, and there are tea sets for drinking tea and chatting by the window, double enjoyment🏞 The key point is that the Chuanshan Park Scenic Area is near the hotel, and it is also close to other attractions.

msg:Guilin Hotel | Italian-style river view hotel, you can come again and again
Guilin's landscape is the best in the world. I came to Guilin just to see the landscape, so I booked a hotel opposite the Li River, which is said to be the closest hotel to the Li River. It takes ten minutes by taxi to go to nearby attractions, such as East-West Lane, Elephant Trunk Hill, Sun and Moon Twin Towers, etc., and you can visit them during the day and night~ It is super suitable for tourism and vacation⛱️, and the Italian style of the hotel is also suitable for lying down. It rained in the past few days when I came here, and it was also a good travel experience to write an essay facing the misty Li River in the hotel.

The hotel's service facilities are super good. Each room has a bathtub, and essential oil balls are given as gifts, so you can relax your tired body during the trip. The dome, swimming pool and lobby bar on the first floor of the hotel are all very photogenic. Recently, there are poker cards specially arranged for 520 check-in♠️. There is also a spa club on the third floor. The technician sister has a very good technique, combining Chinese and Thai massage styles, which relieves all the fatigue. The sky bar on the top floor of the hotel is super photogenic, and you can also come to have a drink at night.

The more than 14,000 silver glass ginkgo leaves on the atrium dome are extremely luxurious. The moment the sunlight☀️ sprinkled in was very shocking.

At the swimming pool of the hotel on the first floor, order a cup of coffee and enjoy the inner peace brought by the Li River for a moment.

The terrace of the bar on the 7th floor overlooks the beautiful scenery of the Li River. The Li River and Guilin city view are unobstructed.

There is a SPA on the third floor. You don’t have to go out if you are tired and want to relax.

The very eye-catching infinity pool satisfies the love of adults and children.

The room is spacious and bright. What I love most is that there is a large floor-to-ceiling window, where you can see the river view. At a glance, all the troubles disappear.
The experience is super good. I will continue to stay next time I come to Guilin.

I stayed at CIAO Hotel during this trip to Guilin, and it felt really good! The service was very good!! They helped me deliver my luggage to the door of the room!

This hotel is right by the Li River. I booked a river view room, and I can see the river view while sitting in the room~

The lobby bar is in European classical style, with a dome composed of 14,000 silver glazed ginkgo leaves on the roof. It looks very exquisite and luxurious, and very smart. I always asked my friends to take pictures for me

The design of the room is also simple and warm, and the furniture inside is all high-end Italian. Lying on the KINGKOIL mattress, it is as comfortable as at home.

❗There is also a bathtub to soak in. Clean and hygienic is what I like. Disposable bath tubs, bath balls and scrubbing gloves are prepared🧤Love it! !

There is also an infinity pool next to the hotel, with shallow and deep water areas, where adults and children can play.

The design of this swimming pool is seamlessly connected with the landscape of Guilin. You can see all the beautiful scenery of Guilin while swimming in it.

You can do spa on the 3rd floor

There is also a coffee-colored bar in the entertainment area on the 7th floor, which feels very comfortable and cozy.

In general, this Guilin Ciao Hotel is really good and worth staying here~

msg:The hotel is right by the Li River, and you can walk to Elephant Trunk Hill. The reason for booking was entirely because of the name Ciao in Italian. The hotel's interior design is quite unique, and it contrasts sharply with the mottled old town of Guilin. After posting the picture of the swimming pool outside the breakfast room on WeChat Moments, my friends thought it was Europe. The glass ginkgo leaf dome in the lobby is also very shocking. The room is also very comfortable, with a short bed that feels very homely. The one-piece washbasin also has a great visual effect. You can see the river view outside the room, but it rained heavily during the Qingming Festival, so we couldn't go there. Fortunately, the hotel scenery is so pleasant that we didn't waste this holiday~

There was also a huge and spectacular dome made of silver-glazed ginkgo leaves behind the lobby. It was so artistic and special. Release the film.
There is also a whole floor for spa
The twin room I chose has a very large bathtub, and the Lijiang River is outside the window. After a day of playing, it is very comfortable to lie down and take a bath (it will be equipped with a disposable bath bag, so you can use it with confidence). The fatigue of the day is all eliminated. Looking forward to the next day’s trip✈️

I just checked out and can’t wait to share the hotel I stayed in in downtown Guilin.
What we are saying is, if you come to Guilin again, continue to live there! ! !

In the city center, by the Li River, not far from anywhere! !
700m to Shijiayuan (this street has a lot of delicious food!!! Shijiayuan small hotpot will be remembered for the rest of your life after eating it 😂)
1.5km to Elephant Trunk Mountain and Sun and Moon Twin Pagodas
It is recommended to choose a river view room🪟The experience is up
The breakfast restaurant is right by the river. It’s super beautiful. The scenery is really as good as the famous coffee shops in Guilin.

Details in place
The design of the whole space is very high-quality. I especially like the bathroom in the room 😂 It really is the home of bloggers 😂 And it has double sinks, which saves time in the morning~
There is a bathtub in the room, with bath salts and lavender bath balls…
March is the rainy season in Guilin, and umbrellas are prepared in the room☂️
There are hot water, fruits and snacks in the public area🥧

Breakfast is a buffet style, including Guilin rice noodles
The top floor of the hotel is a sky bar, right on the riverside, so beautiful! ! !
The spa lasts until early in the morning. If you are tired after a long day, you can come and experience it. There are only over 200 guests~
Passing by a baby's room that is being tidied up, it is a duplex structure, and the first floor is full of toys, making it parent-child friendly👫

The Western restaurant on the 7th floor has a great view. I didn't expect it to be so delicious. I ate four meals during my two-night stay. The ingredients were very tasty and well presented, and the chef was attentive. The room is clean and tidy, very bright, and the drainage of the bath needs to be improved. Foxlook’s fox travel photography service is very good. The photographer is very patient and easy to communicate with. The photos taken from various angles are very good, especially the retouching.

I stayed in Guilin for three days and two nights. The weather was very bad on the second day, with rain and fog. I took a Fox Look travel photo shoot in the hotel. The shooting effect was very good, and the photographer was very good at taking photos. It was mainly a photo type, and the ethnic style was also a photo.
btw The bars in Guilin are really fun. I didn’t see the scenery at all and I didn’t go to the scenic spots at all. Two-day trip to the bar...haha I recommend bd😜

Let’s get to the important point, don’t choose a parent-child loft if you have a baby. Although it’s very large, it’s really inconvenient to run up and down the stairs.

The smart toilet inside the hotel is one of the highlights that our brother likes. What does he like more about the design of the up and down stairs and the children's tent below.

Environment: A new store with a full sense of design. It seems to be quite famous locally. There was a pick-up team on the second day after check-in.

Service: Very good. Because I brought the whole family with me, I contacted the hotel in advance and arranged for them to be accommodated on the same floor. They also provided consultation services for travel. Check-in was also very good.

Although the bathroom ware may not be from a big brand, the hotel's breakfast ingredients, presentation and care make up for this shortcoming. It is very close to Xiangshan Scenic Area and the Sun and Moon Twin Towers. It was still a very satisfying stay.

The first time I stepped into Guilin, the romance I felt came from Qiao CIAO Hotel! The design is simple and low-key, but it exudes a sense of luxury. Every design element exudes an intoxicating sense of romantic ritual. 😍

The location is great, at the bridgehead of the Li River in Guilin, with a panoramic view of the Li River and Chuanshan Park. In the afternoon, we took photos and drank afternoon tea in the lobby bar, overlooking the infinity pool and the Li River. It was simply a paradise on earth. 🌈

The dome on the first floor of the hotel is very designed and artistic, I can’t help but take pictures! It’s so exciting!

The Sky Bar on the seventh floor is even more memorable. Make a cocktail after dinner, have a drink, and then go to the spa to enjoy yourself. The room is spacious and clean, with aromatherapy essential oils, bath salts, and bubble balls all provided. It's so considerate! 💆♀️💖

On this trip to Guilin, in addition to the pampering between the mountains and rivers, there is also the care of CIAO Hotel. #romanticfirs**eet# #luxuryexperience# #Guilinlijiang# #SPATime# #小luxury# 🌟

The only thing I'm dissatisfied about is that I can't control the heating and cooling of the room's air conditioner myself (but asking the housekeeper will solve the problem quickly), and the thickness of the quilt is not suitable for the current temperature.

The appearance is relatively old, but the inside is quite luxurious, and it is very photogenic. The room equipment is pretty good and looks clean and tidy.

🚽The toilet is divided into a separate room with a sink, which is very similar to the layout of the bathroom in Parkview Green.
	
🛁There are many things I like about the wet area.
❤️The wash basin is an integrated design. The sink and soap table are integrated in one go. The faucet TOU and switch are separated, which is very futuristic!
🛁After the bathroom door is opened, it is connected to the guest room. The space flows and you can enjoy the view while taking a bath. 🧖♀️The hotel is equipped with essential oil balls, massage oil, bath salts, steam eye masks...it is quite attentive.
🪞Full-length mirror in shower glass door
	
🎨The right hand side of the door is equipped with a very beautiful umbrella and a woven bamboo hat. It actually looks as beautiful as a piece of art.
🍵The bar has tea, capsule coffee, cold drinks and 🍺local beer. You can try it!
	
❤️The main color of the lobby bar on the first floor is black, with exotic soft furnishings, and the lighting is just right.
❤️Outside the breakfast room is the infinity swimming pool. 🏊It is a check-in spot for internet celebrities. It reflects the beautiful landscape of Guilin, making it quite photogenic!
❤️Sky Bar on the seventh floor is also a very popular dining bar. The glass panels provide an unobstructed view of the scenery. The interior is mainly brown and is furnished with Italian furniture.
❤️Breakfast is quite rich in variety. You must try the local specialties Guilin rice noodles, water chestnuts, boat cakes, and mugwort cakes.

msg:Guilin photoshoot｜Ciao Hotel🏨
Hotels you can’t miss when visiting Guilin
Designer hotel with novel and high-end decoration style~
The location is also very good. It’s about ten minutes away from the city center by taxi⌚️ Located in Xiangshan District
Photos taken at the hotel’s swimming pool restaurant on the first floor are beyond the scope of the photo
The room is very large
But it doesn’t feel empty and feels warm🛋️The decoration is modern, novel and high-end🛁The position of the bathtub is really just right. Take a bath🧼It really doesn’t feel too comfortable
I really like the 2 wash basins. It is very convenient to wash up when traveling with your best friends.
The toilet and 🚿shower room are also separated. The smart thermostatic toilet🚽 is very user-friendly and does not disturb you at all, which greatly improves the efficiency of going out!!
Very suitable for young people to stay in this hotel! The dome on the first floor 🕊️The spa on the third floor and the sky bar on the seventh floor are both amazing!

msg:If you want to recommend a city hotel, the CIAO must have a name.
It is a quiet designer hotel in the middle of the hustle and bustle. It is convenient for traveling. The hotel is located in Xiangshan District, next to the Li River. You can see the river view from the room. It is only ten minutes away from the city center by taxi. It is also very convenient for a quiet vacation.


The tens of thousands of glazed ginkgo leaves on the dome on the first floor are minimalist and pure white, and are very visually impactful when taking photos.
The hotel's Run•Spa Bar is also highly recommended. You can have a spa trea**ent after a long day of travel.
In the evening, you can also go to the Rooftop Bar to get drunk. It is free and romantic, accompanied by the sunset and the wind of the Li River in the evening, which is comfortable and pleasant.
The river view room is also equipped with a large bathtub, who can refuse~

Children would like this series more. The butler also noticed my hesitation and said before I could say anything. They offered to upgrade me to a room with a city view. I really loved the oversized washbasin and large bathtub in the room. Although it was a city view room, the large floor-to-ceiling glass windows could still see the hustle and bustle of the bridge and the beautiful view of the Li River from the oblique angle. There are Luo Han Guo gummies in the candy jar that are soft and glutinous and very delicious. The experience is quite amazing!

Share a bicycle or walk along the riverside and take a leisurely stroll. At dusk, there are various snacks, restaurants, and various stores along the way.

My sister and I visited Guilin for the first time. It wasn’t until we stayed here that we realized how important it is to choose a high-quality hotel‼ ️
Check-in experience🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
🏠: The environment here is very good, the room is decorated in milky white, simple and elegant! The room we chose came with a large floor-to-ceiling window, and outside the window was the beautiful view of the Li River! So comfortable

🛁: There is also a bathtub and a large makeup mirror, which is super friendly for girls. After shopping outside for a day, it is wonderful to take a comfortable bath at night, which relieves the fatigue of the day.

🥣：Breakfast✔️
Very rich, with many categories, both Chinese and Western styles are available here! There are also very authentic Guilin rice noodles (I think they are more delicious than those sold outside!
There is another service that I think is very good. If you don’t want to go downstairs for breakfast, the waiter will also deliver the meal to the room, which is really great.

🏊: There is also an infinity swimming pool, where you can take photos and check in with great movies📷
If you also come to Guilin for travel, I recommend you to come and stay in a good hotel. The trip will be twice as happy. It’s really worth it!

At the front desk of the hotel, you can look up with her/him at the glazed ginkgo leaf dome on the top, and tell her/her the story of the ginkgo leaf. In ancient times, the ginkgo leaf was a token of love given by boys to their beloved girls, representing purity. and beauty, every design element in the store is full of a sense of romantic ritual

The design of the hotel rooms is warm, pleasant and comfortable. When you open the window, you can smell the fragrance of the mountains and rivers and see the city's highly scattered peaks, which are like a landscape painting.

The Qin-themed infinity swimming pool is divided into a shallow water area for children and a deep water area for adults. It is seamlessly connected with the Guilin landscape. You can overlook the mountains in the distance and the Li River up close. This relaxing feeling is worth enjoying!

When you are tired, go to the moist-themed spa bar for a spa trea**ent and let your thoughts calm down. Everything at this moment has nothing to do with you, only your peaceful self.

In the evening you can go to Sky Bar with the theme of Chen
 It's a comfortable and cozy bar. It's nice to listen to some light music and just sit quietly like this!

msg:Unilaterally declared that this is the best hotel in Guilin^_^
The design aesthetic of the Italian team is very online, and every detail looks comfortable and exquisite. I personally feel that it is much more western-style and attractive than traditional brand hotels. You can take photos from the moment you enter to check out and release the film!
The service is impeccable. From the front desk to the rooftop bar, every staff member has a warm smile and cares about the guests' feelings. They are professional and warm, and there are also great little surprises for birthdays.
Hygiene aspect is very good. What I personally feel is the most amazing thing is that there is no odor at all. There is no smell at all in the bathroom or bathroom, and it will not be covered up with aromatherapy. This is really too strong! Have a restful and comfortable stay.
The only drawback is that the hotel is so comfortable that I don’t want to go out hahahaha. Fortunately, Guilin’s scenic spots are all accessible by bike or taxi at the starting price. After a while, you can go back to the hotel and continue to lie down.
In addition, I recommend two projects to try by myself. One is travel photography, which is a one-on-one service. I will communicate my favorite style and requirements in advance. I am very lucky to meet the professional teacher Xixi, who understands my point very well. On my birthday, Capture the desired feeling and gain a unique memory.
The second one is the SPA on the third floor. I wanted to relax after traveling for a long time. Sister No. 6’s strong hands and humorous and meticulous way relieved the body’s pain.

Just beside the Li River, the scenery is so beautiful that taking pictures is definitely a must-see
The aesthetics of the hotel decoration is completely on the tip of my heart
It must have been designed with a lot of money. The layout hardware is of high quality.
As if sleeping in an art palace, the a**osphere is full!
Riverside restaurant on the first floor, the super-large swimming pool is in front of you
There is a spa leisure area on the third floor, you can relax if you are tired
The seventh floor is the sky bar, it is very pleasant to have a drink at night

The check-in experience is very good and I don't want to check out!

There is no noise at all and the items in the room are free. I used it. The bathrobe was very comfortable to wear, and taking a bath in the big bathtub was very relaxing.

The mountain view in the distance is also average. There is also a road below, which is not right next to the river. We arrived in the middle of the night. I carried a lot of things and asked the waiter where the elevator was. I pointed and said they didn't even help with luggage. I was sure I wouldn't stay there again and I didn't want to mislead others.

The curtains are opened, and the beautiful scenery outside the window is unobstructed.
Here you can have a panoramic view of the Li River and Elephant Trunk Mountain outside the window~

The feeling of staying here is that I don’t really think that Jiang’s room is more cost-effective. The room is spacious and has a double washbasin, which is very convenient, but the River View room does not. So on the second night, I resolutely stayed in the original room that didn't look at the river. Anyway, I can see the Lijiang River when I walk out of the hotel, so it doesn't matter. The real thing is that the room is comfortable. The restaurant can see a river view, which is very impressive.

The only thing to pay attention to is the orientation of the room. If you want to see the river view, you must choose the right room. Ordinary rooms can only see the distant mountains, and the close view is residential buildings.

The shower head in the bathroom is very cool, and the bath is comfortable!
The gift of drinks, beer and various snacks can be regarded as a surprise for the baby!
There is a small swimming pool outdoors on the first floor of the hotel, just let the children play!
The view of the hotel is invincible. There is a small bar-style restaurant on the top floor. Eat some fast food, drink some wine, and enjoy the scenery! It is very good to choose such a hotel to see the scenery in Guilin!
There are also places to eat nearby. It needs to be about 1000 meters away to compensate for the fact that the hotel does not have a restaurant where you can eat a big meal!
It is said that there are travel photos, but I have no experience!

In the evening, you can dine at the Chen·Sky Bar on the seventh floor of the hotel. Like a high-end banquet hall, the display is all made of Italian high-end furniture. The furniture uses "NORHOR", which is luxurious and exquisite.

There is also a professional spa on the third floor—Run·Spa Bar. The decoration adopts Italian minimalist style, just like an isolated art space, and I feel that the whole person has calmed down~

The next day, I had breakfast at the Yu Lobby Bar. The lobby is decorated in a gorgeous European style. On the left is the infinity river view swimming pool. The river is used as the cloth, and you can enjoy the Li River and mountains up close.

The dome next to the lobby is composed of 14,000 pieces of silver glazed ginkgo leaves. It is pure and elegant, white and clean. It looks amazing to the naked eye. It can also be used for dining, resting, and guest communication. It can accommodate more than 30 people

Eating exquisite breakfast, looking at the beautiful scenery and stunning hotel decoration, it's so comfortable

In short, Ciao Hotel is the place I will come to Guilin next time:)

The hotel was chosen randomly. After arriving at the hotel, the staff were very enthusiastic and ran over to help with the luggage from a long distance. The hotel surprised us. The surface is not good, but the facilities inside are very luxurious, very new, very individual, and the room is even better. Very clean, very Italian, the room view is good, but very quiet. The breakfast is rich, the restaurant has a beautiful view, and the first-line river view is beautiful. You can see the sunrise in the morning. It is very comfortable and enjoyable.

I went out for a trip and stayed in a hotel I was satisfied with, and my sense of happiness soared. My husband said that I felt like I was in Italy. The river view infinity pool + sky bar + room with river view soaking pool! Satisfied my imagination of vacation! Romantic and beautiful~
-
Located at the corner of the Lijiang River, it skillfully combines the beauty with the scenery. Their home is in the center of Guilin, but there is no hustle and bustle of ordinary hotels. Guilin Qiao CIAO Hotel, born in the mountains and waters of Guilin, has a natural and friendly beauty.
-
The lobby shocked me deeply, as exquisite as a museum. The dome is composed of 14,000 pieces of silver glazed ginkgo leaves, which is spectacular and elegant, so beautiful that it is speechless.
-
The whole hotel is in a high-end modern wabi-sabi style, with super good taste, and the photos are all high-end. Moreover, the matching mattresses and toiletries are all selected international first-line brands, so you can completely experience the feeling of being at home. The room type we live in has the river view marble pool that I love, taking a bath facing the Li River in the textbook, it really feels like the pinnacle of life!
-
The buffet breakfast is rich. Eating breakfast next to the river-view infinity pool feels like being on the banks of the Seine, so comfortable!
-
There is also my favorite infinity pool and SKY BAR in the hotel. To be honest, I can spend a day here even if I don’t go out to play. The infinity swimming pool connects with Guilin's mountains and rivers, directly connecting the swimming pool with nature, watching the Lijiang River up close ~ SKY BAR is as comfortable as home, where you can have a drink here, and the slightly drunk state will make visitors intoxicated.
The indescribable beauty and tranquility are all in CIAO, Guilin. My husband said that he will stay here again next time! 🥰

Facilities: The facilities are complete, and the drinks in the refrigerator are great, free to drink.
Hygiene: Another thing worthy of praise is hygiene. Disinfectant wipes are prepared next to the toilet, which relieves many people from worrying about using the toilet; the couch in the room is light-colored, but it is very clean, unlike many hotels where there will be water stains, etc. Dirty, the washbasin is an extra-long style that all girls like, with two washbasins, clean and tidy.
Travel: The Lijiang River is across the road, and the Elephant Trunk Hill Park is very close, so it is very pleasant to walk there leisurely.
Environment: The room type I booked can't see the river view. The hotel lobby and elevator hall are decorated in a new Chinese style. The photos are very good, quiet and comfortable.
Friends who travel to Guilin can rest assured to book this hotel.

The restaurant on the 7th floor is pretty good, quiet, and the scenery is beautiful, with a first-line view of the river. The room is a bit stuffy in this weather, but everything else is fine.

The material selection and design in the room are biased towards Italian minimalist style, which I believe is the style that most people will like. In addition, the solid-color bathroom is really outstanding!
The location of the hotel is very good, it is very convenient for customers who come by plane, because the hotel is very close to the civil aviation building by the civil aviation bus.
Outside the balcony of the bar on the top floor of the hotel, you can enjoy the super first-line view of the Li River~

The hotel is located by the Lijiang River. Follow the navigation and walk along the river to find the door. The hotel is not big, with more than 60 rooms, but the location is obvious. You can see the whole picture of the hotel on the Lijiang Bridge.
Everywhere in the hotel has a sense of design. The light and dark colors in different scenes can be seen to have been designed by designers.
The design in the room is simple and elegant, there will be no exaggerated decorations to disturb the peace of rest, and the stay is very comfortable.

In fact, there are many hotels with good environment, but this one not only has a very beautiful environment, but the most important thing is that the service is really first-class, a super five-star experience.
As soon as you enter the lobby, you will receive very polite service and help you carry your luggage into the room. If you have any travel questions, you can consult with the butler at the front desk. The 24-hour online reply is very humane. Snacks and drinks in the room are free, and an afternoon tea is included. In addition, there are free products for bathing in the bathroom. I think it is a good deal to buy value-added services for less than 1,000 yuan. It is not five-star but the service is excellent. This is the core of brand competition and the most essential difference. I sincerely hope that The hotel is getting stronger and stronger, radiating people all over the country.

The last thing I want to say is that the most important thing to come out to play is to be happy hahahaha. The scenery along the way is very beautiful. You must be accompanied by good service to enjoy it wholeheartedly. If possible, try to use money to buy a good experience. Finally, I wish you all a good journey.
happy to do

msg:After checking in, I found that a comfortable and beautiful hotel is the key to a successful trip🍃👍🏻
The pretty Ciao Hotel, which combines Italian and Chinese aesthetics, is the most satisfying part of my trip to Guangxi.
From the moment I entered the lobby, I was shocked by various aesthetic designs.
Located in the central city of Xiangshan District. Built near the water, quiet in the busy city.
The dome design strung together by 140,000 pieces of crystal ginkgo leaves is elegant and pure.
It's like staying in a gallery art gallery.
Ubiquitous modern science➕aesthetic design runs through the entire guest room.
The details are exquisite and all supplies are of the highest quality.
Lighting and authority dry and wet separation layout is quite scientific.
This is the most comfortable and most valuable hotel I have stayed in in the past six months🏨
It must be hard to find a room to be worthy of my love and recognition for it👍🏻
The SPA on the 3rd floor and the morning sky bar on the 7th floor are also beautiful, and the distinguished guests must try it.

During the selection process, I was attracted by Qiao Hotel, because the location of the hotel is next to the Li River, and the pictures are very beautiful; What surprised me the most is that parent-child rooms in other hotels are much more expensive than ordinary rooms, but Qiao is not. It can provide a cost-effective choice for family travelers like us; after communicating with the staff, we learned that The little yellow duck theme room is also a new room type, and all facilities and supplies are very new;

Breakfast: The hotel’s breakfast is served at the restaurant along the river on the first floor. It is a buffet. There are Western and Chinese dishes, and the appearance and taste are all online. The most important thing is that the environment is indeed elegant and beautiful.

Location: The hotel is located at the head of the Lijiang River Bridge. You can reach the gate by crossing the bottom of the bridge. You can also see it at a glance on the Lijiang River Bridge, which is very obvious.

Executive Lounge: The 7th floor of the hotel is a semi-open-air bar facing the Li River, where you can enjoy the excellent view of the Li River.

Compared with many luxurious old hotels, Qiao will make me feel more comfortable when I check in. Almost all rooms include bathtubs, which is simply the favorite of young people. And there are free bathtub bags, bath balls, and bath salts, saving you the trouble of buying by yourself; the hotel's afternoon tea is also very high-quality, both in terms of appearance and taste.

msg:I booked a Guili twin bed room. The first impression I had when I opened the door was not very good: there was an old stain in the middle of the carpet, and the room was at the same level as the building opposite. When I opened the window, I could only see the building across the road. Not going to the river, and the picture on the Internet are two different things (the window view of the Guili twin bed that the hotel put on the Internet may be P), so I went downstairs to check with the front desk whether the room type was wrong, and the answer I got was: The room type given to me is correct, this room type can only see Dianjiang. So I went back to my room a little disappointed. As soon as I went upstairs, I received a call from the housekeeper. I didn’t expect the housekeeper to take my feedback seriously and came to check. Later, I changed to a room with a clean carpet. In addition, after the floor is high, it is also a room type in the same location. Open the window and see it It is much more open and the sense of living is improved.
advantage:
1. The breakfast is rich, with both Chinese and Western food.
2. Double sinks, spacious wash room.
3. Our whole family thinks that the biggest advantage of this apar**ent type is that the toilet and bathroom are separated!
4. The decoration details are good (although the toilet space is small, there is a small washbasin), and there is a small shelf in the bathroom for drying clothes (usually some underwear is washed).
5. The service is good, and the hygiene requirements are high. I also saw a special person checking the hygiene outside the balcony of the restaurant during the morning meal.
Disadvantages:
1. The twin rooms are two 1.2-meter-high. It will be difficult for the couple to bring older children to sleep. It would be more reasonable to add a multi-bed room.
2. The cocktails are good-looking, but not professional enough. I didn't taste the alcohol after drinking two glasses.
3. The experience of pillows and mattresses is so-so, which is a pity. With such a high-end design and a restaurant with such a good view on the seventh floor, it can really be said to be a high-end hotel if you order the bedding.
I forgot to take a picture of the room, only the restaurant on the 7th floor. I also took a few pictures of the breakfast the next day, and one of the cocktails ordered in the evening.

Breakfast: The level of breakfast is probably like that of an ordinary 4-star hotel. The artificial bar only has noodles and noodles, which is a bit special. Steam some Qingming rake these. The fried eggs were all fried. There are only two types of Western-style hot meals for bacon sausages, and they are a bit slow to replenish, and the others are all Chinese-style stir-fried dishes. The more distinctive one is tomato baked cheese. Coffee beans are dark roasted. There are more types of bread and desserts. The salad area and cereal are also quite satisfactory.

The hotel is built with the essence of Italian Byzantine architecture and the tone of Chinese minimalism and classicism.
No matter what room type you choose here, you can enjoy the oversized silent floor-to-ceiling viewing windows.
The hotel's breakfast is a Chinese and Western buffet on the first floor. There are not many types, but they are all exquisite and taste good.
The hotel also has charging parking spaces, which solves our battery life anxiety when traveling.
The 3rd floor of the hotel is the SPA and gym. We didn't experience the SPA because of the time, but the environment is very comfortable after looking at it.
In addition, there is an executive bar on the top floor of the hotel by the river, where you can enjoy Italian afternoon tea and coffee while enjoying the river view.
For those who want to travel to Guilin and want to live in style, it is right to come to CIAO~

The butler helps carry the luggage upstairs, provides various thoughtful services, and the breakfast is suitable for all ages. The sanitary conditions are good, and the toilet is a smart toilet. This is the only hotel where I take my baby upstairs and nothing else. The suggestion is, if you know that you are one big and two small, it is better to prepare two toothbrushes and bathrobes in advance. So this time I give 99 points.

msg:The geographical location is very convenient to go anywhere, there is a parking space, I thought it was just a minimalist design, but it actually hides a mystery, the bathroom and the toilet are separated, and there is a separate toilet room, so that the functions are separated and do not disturb each other, the smart toilet, and the double sink design. The room is very spacious, the bed is huge and can be rolled freely, the bedrooms and bathrooms are all floor-to-ceiling windows, intelligent switch control, Bluetooth surround sound, you can have a drink with friends in the room, and you can see the Chuanshan Tower through the window. The service attitude is good, the hygiene is good, and the disposable supplies are complete. Next time I bring friends to stay here, there are only two minor drawbacks. The charging port next to the bed is too far away from the bed, so I can’t lie down and play with my phone while charging. Standing by the window after taking a shower, I didn't realize that the floor-to-ceiling windows were completely transparent until I went out.

Service: The receptionist is very kind. The Ctrip reservation includes an afternoon tea dessert and coffee. Since I arrived late and missed the afternoon tea, the lady at the front desk packed the afternoon tea for us the next day and brought sweetness when I checked out. Keep going, it's heartwarming.
Hygiene: I saw the introduction that the hotel has only been renovated in recent years, and every corner of the room is also extremely clean. The only downside is that the swimming pool and SPA area cannot be entered due to renovation.

The bed in the double room is really big. Two sisters (each weighing more than 100 pounds) are lying on the bed, as if separated by the Mariana Trench, a huge bed! After staying in the hotel for so many years, it can be said that it is the first time I have seen such a big one! So happy!

There is also a giant sofa in the room, which feels at least 3 meters long and is very soft. It can even sleep two people and sleep on their feet.

The bathtub in the room 🛁 has a very good view, but it is too late to enjoy it, so I will book again next time!

There is a cloakroom and a separate toilet (separate from the shower, bathtub and dressing table). In short, friends from Hong Kong and Shenzhen are shocked! it's actually very good!

Opposite the hotel is the bar (｡ì _ í｡). Taxi within 10 yuan. Guilin taxis start at 9 during the day and 11 or 12 at night! Didi 10 will do!

I love it! It would be nice if the price could drop a little more...

The afternoon tea upstairs of the hotel is also great, the scenery is good, the cakes are delicious, and the drinks and coffee can be improved a bit!

It's good to have a cigar, I even want to smoke one🚬

I chose this hotel and it is really good value for money. The location is excellent. Basically, it is a very reasonable distance from the city, whether it is shopping malls or scenic spots.

Facilities: Every facility in the hotel is very good. The bathtub is also specially equipped with a disposable bath bag. These do not need to be prepared by yourself. The overall scenery of the skybar on the roof is very good. If the weather is good, you can see the Elephant Mountain in the distance. The hotel facilities are definitely worth the money.

Service: The hotel service is very warm, whether it is the check-in staff at the front desk or the hotel, there is always someone to help if you need it.

1 hour of luxury travel photography: when I made the reservation, my friend gave me a drink. I gave a one-hour travel photography here. I happened to be with my colleagues and everyone was very happy. The photographer was patient and professional The overall experience was very good.

Strongly recommend everyone to experience

msg:I rarely write reviews. This time I didn't feel very good. I checked in after 9 o'clock in the evening and found a strong tide smell when I entered the room. It's a bit like the sour tide of old houses or old hotels. After calling, my aunt came over and opened the room across the corridor and found that there was no such smell. Later, we communicated to change the room and went to see the other two rooms of the same type on the floor below, which also had the same smell. I looked at the map, it should be Because the rooms in this row are all facing north (the orange box in the picture), the weather in Guilin is hot and humid, and there is no sun facing north. The carpet may not be cleaned frequently, resulting in a sour and humid smell. The staff said that there is no other room to choose from. Think about it. There is no way to do it. The matter is over here. However, before going to bed, I found a cockroach on the carpet. I contacted the hotel staff to come and catch the cockroach. Later, the hotel staff called and said I was sorry and wanted to change my room. When I upgraded to a river view room, I said it would be too much trouble to pack my luggage. What I want to say is that when the room smelled just now, didn’t it say that there were no other rooms, in fact, I didn’t want me to change to a river view room, because that room was more expensive. You must know that there will be no sour tide in the Jiangjing room facing east. You see, this is the pattern of the staff of this hotel. It is not their fault that the room has a sour tide smell. You can't live in it, so I won't change it for you. The room, unless there are cockroaches, will change it for you, and the hotel room facilities are okay, but the breakfast variety is very small, a bit simple

If you make a fuss and make trouble for an hour, you can extend the room rate by 200. It’s enough to make money. Then the guests in the other room in the lobby are in the same situation. They also say that you don’t have time to carry your luggage. Our waiter can help you pack your luggage and move it out. Thank you very much for seeing. You must avoid pitfalls in the comments.

msg:Qiao is definitely the most comfortable hotel with the best environment and the best service I have stayed in during my trip to Guilin, no one! If I go to Guilin again, there is no doubt that I will choose to settle in. The interior decoration is too much to my liking. It is simple, modern, bright and warm. If I have to say that there is something I am not satisfied with, it is the swimming pool at the entrance, which may be tiled. I didn't choose the right color, so the swimming pool doesn't look blue and clear. Of course, this little deficiency doesn't affect the pretty inner show at all!

I saw the bathtub next to the hotel's floor-to-ceiling windows and soaked in a hot water. Taking a bath, you can directly see the green hills by the Li River. The bathroom is super large, and the double sinks are separated from wet and dry. It is really the most suitable for girlfriends to travel!

Travel itself is to experience an extraordinary way of life, and travel is essentially a kind of "exchange of life". A car, a road, a scenic spot, and a local food are the initial expectations of our travel...
 Check-in experience: the experience link, the environmental experience is inevitable, the boutique hotel style, the detail design is exquisite, the combination of Italian style and Guilin elements is just right.
The little brother and sister of the hotel staff are kind and nice, especially the housekeeper Billy,
Ask for feedback humbly and respond to customer needs efficiently. Especially nice~

Because of the painful lessons I learned in Yangshuo Ding B&B, the rigid standard for me to choose a hotel now is that the room area is about 50 square meters, and the bathroom facilities should be good enough. This one completely meets my standards, I ignored my husband's thoughts and insisted on being pretty, but I didn't expect it to exceed expectations! As soon as I got off the taxi, I started the intimate service, which is comparable to a five-star resort hotel! The internal facilities are very new. The most surprising thing is that the breakfast is very delicious. It is strongly recommended that the dry noodles are served with crispy skin. The restaurant environment is also excellent, facing the Li River, so beautiful!

msg:There are many hotels in Guilin, originally planned to live in club med, but the location is too far. Finally, after repeated comparisons, I chose this pretty CIAO. I thought it was just a boutique hotel, similar to Shanghai Pudi Hotel. When I arrived at the door of the hotel, I felt like I was in Bangkok. On a hot day, there was an outdoor swimming pool surrounded by greenery, which was great. Watching the local people in Guilin swimming in the river, the people in the store are separated from them by a tree, we can see them, they can't see us. Still very interesting. The room I chose is near the water. You can sit on the lazy sofa and watch passers-by. I like this feeling. The furniture in the room is solid wood with good texture. I looked at the picture on the net before, and I felt that the floor was bad, but it was not. It was very good. It was very comfortable to step on. The bed and pillows were comfortable. The design of the room is very strong. In addition to good hardware, service is nothing to say. Very carefully. Hope the fruit can be improved next time.

The butler service is also responsive. On the last day, because we couldn't make it to the afternoon tea, we even packed it for us
The design of the hotel is also super healing, especially the bathroom, which is great
The breakfast is also very rich, and it is delivered to the room
The only thing is that you can arrange a small stool in the room. It is really inconvenient for two people to eat at a small round table and only have a sofa.
Everything else is perfect, very comfortable, don't want to go out, just want to stay in the hotel

🧹Hygiene: Overall, the hygiene is good, there is no visible hair.
🍃Environment: The hotel is located in the center of Guilin, right across the Lijiang River. The hotel room type can see the river view by opening the curtains, which is commendable.
🔔Service: The service is also very good. Basically, the housekeeper will communicate on WeChat in time, and it is very comfortable to do a horse and chicken in the hotel. However, when I went to the Qing Bar on the roof at night, the air conditioner was not turned on, which was not very comfortable. It is recommended that the air conditioner be turned on, otherwise it will be very stuffy.
Summary: It is worth staying, and the recommendation index is 5 stars.

All the tiredness of the journey was swept away by the relaxed, happy and funny experience when I checked in. All the facilities in the hotel exceeded expectations. Whenever I call the front desk, the problem can be solved at the first time every time. Every time I pass by the front desk, I can see the smile on the face of the staff, which makes me forget that I am traveling, but every time I come back to the hotel, it feels like coming home.

It's very close to Guilin Station and you can overlook the Chuanshan Scenic Spot by the river. I like this location very much. Basically, I can't pick out a hotel that can't be faulted.

You have to run upstairs and downstairs to get water. The designer must have never been in contact with children. I don't know anything about parenting at all. The lighting, room layout, etc. are unreasonable. Besides, the service is basically non-existent
The only thing worth mentioning is that the bed is more comfortable, because it is made of tatami mats, so you don't have to worry about your child falling off the bed. The overall design is not bad, and the location is excellent next to the Lijiang River

Due to the epidemic situation last year, it did not come to fruition, so this year I went there despite the epidemic. You can see Xiangshan Mountain when you go out of the hotel, and Lijiang River is at the door. The little sister at the front desk smiled like a home away from home. The little brother was very capable of carrying luggage. The room was large and clean. The housekeeper responded when he called him. The breakfast was not much but delicious. It is worth recommending to friends, and a hotel that must stay again next time.

Environment: The hotel facilities are still very new, and the space is spacious and bright.

Service: The service is thoughtful and meticulous, and the attitude is just right. If you have washed clothes in the room, you can contact the front desk to dry them, and the room water will be provided for free after drinking. Going downstairs to pick up the takeaway, the waitress poured a cup of sour plum soup because I was afraid of the heat. Parents and children are very satisfied throughout the whole process. Recommended to friends who have the same itinerary, and the family of friends also thinks it is very good.

Just like the name of CIAO, it is said to be designed by a careful designer. The entire hotel has a sense of design and incorporates many Japanese elements, such as smart toilets, making it very comfortable to live in.
The breakfast can’t be considered rich, there is everything that should be there, everything is just right!
The western food on the 7th floor is also very authentic, it is worth living in a boutique hotel with high cost performance.

After I got tired from shopping, Miss Lucy poured me a glass of Luo Han Guo water, which is really super sweet.
The hotel is really good, the location is close to the Li River, very close to Elephant Trunk Hill, in the city center, the transportation is very convenient, the room’s floor-to-ceiling windows can see the nearby river and distant mountains during the day, and the outside lights at night are also good
Early, you can choose the time of your choice. Chinese and Western styles are delivered to the room. I got up late so I told Miss Lucy to deliver it at ten o’clock. I really will take care of everything.
There is also a clearing bar upstairs on the top floor. There is also a terrace outside the bar. You can get two glasses for free if you get the room card. Because it is raining, there is no going out. If it does not rain, the wind on the terrace is still very good. of
Another point is that whisky sour does not have egg whites, so it is generally very good

After receiving the certificate, I owed my wife a little bit and didn't prepare any surprises for her. I felt very guilty. After thinking about it for a long time, I wanted to choose a weekend to move her.
I screened a lot of hotels, and finally chose CIAO. This choice made me very shy. Special thanks to Mr. Ming, the hotel butler Billy and Min, for making a special arrangement! You are first-rate 🉐️, starting from receiving my needs, actively give me ideas and give me various suggestions! Let us spend a very different weekend.

The only downside is that some services can't keep up a bit, and the breakfast missed delivery has never been found. The lobby did not manage the area when doing activities, and the door was blocked when the movable board was removed, which affected the normal guest’s check-in experience. As a guest, they only want a quiet environment. Fortunately, the butler, Arlene, was very meticulous and enthusiastic in the service process, which made up for my feelings and provided me with a lot of convenience. I have to travel on time every month and will come again because of the service of the butler.

msg:Guilin tourism and business travel conscientious recommendation ❤️
Really good hotels are really serviced by heart. It is the kind of mentality that the host entertains guests to the home, the kind of feeling that gives you all the good things, sincere, thoughtful and meticulous.

🚗 Transportation: It is very close to Guilin Station, and the transportation is very convenient. There are also many delicious foods downstairs, and Shijiayuan, which is not far from the locals, has many delicious foods.

🧹Hygiene: The sanitation is very good. When you enter the room, it feels very fresh and smells good. There is also a purifier in the room, which is really awesome.

🍃Environment: I have nothing to say about the environment. The design of the lobby on the first floor is very attractive to girls. The restaurant and swimming pool are very popular, and the top floor can also be used for outdoor scenes. It is a starry sky, and you can see the river view. The handsome guys and beauties at the front desk have upgraded the river-view room, which is really a must-see, and it is easy to make movies. The layout of the room is very artistic, with many Guilin elements. The wood-designed control panel is a built-in switch, which is very design and texture. There are hats and fabric lampshades, it is very charming. You can watch the river and the bridge leisurely by the window. There is the river downstairs. There are many people swimming. The occasional cruise ship comes by. The outside world is bustling and the world inside the window is quiet and comfortable. Quiet, it’s really comfortable~ Full of high class sense

🔔Service: The service is also great, manually @酒店的管家Nancy and Billy, get off the car to help with the luggage, I arrived early, and it was not time to check in. The little brother at the front desk and enthusiastically guided me to the restaurant to rest. I have a lot of luggage, and my younger brother also helped deliver the room to the room. The staff in the entire hotel feels very warm and kind to me. Because of the epidemic, breakfast is delivered to the room. The hotel has prepared Chinese and Western breakfast, which is very considerate! The package I ordered included a travel shot as a gift, and the handsome guys on the tour shot were also quite nice, and they were more attentive. Generally speaking, this hotel feels very good to me. The details are well done. It really suits my appetite for a detail monster like me~ Will come to stay

Call the front desk, just let the waiter come up and say wipe it again. Asking the lobby manager to contact, has been ignoring the guest's request. No management staff took the initiative to contact to understand the situation. In Guilin, more than 1,000 hotels are so perfunctory about hygiene. The price doesn't match the hygiene. Not recommended

The hotel is very clean, and sweet water and fruits are prepared very intimately. There are no shortcomings in the environment. Even the breakfast and afternoon tea products are a bit unsatisfactory, but it is inevitable that they are not cooked right away.

We booked a duplex room. The childlike design of the room made an eleven-year-old child reluctant to go out with us. The hotel service is also very user-friendly. When we asked to buy breakfast for the children, we specially gave us three days of breakfast. Butler Arlene's thoughtful service made us feel at home. Next time I come to Guilin, I will definitely stay in this hotel and recommend friends to stay.
What's interesting is that a taxi was called that day. The driver heard that we were staying at this hotel and immediately said that this hotel is very good. Although it has not been rated yet, it is super five-star.
The breakfast in the hotel restaurant is very delicious, I recommend everyone to try the rice noodles.

The construction of the hotel environment is completely above the standard of a five-star hotel (as a florist tells everyone, the lobby can use flowers is generally not bad), I have not studied this hotel carefully, but I believe his designer absolutely does not Generally, whether it’s in the public area or in the room, it’s a pity that I only thought about taking pictures after I checked in, so I didn’t take many pictures in the room. I suggest you check in yourself, especially the integrated design of the wash basin in the bathroom. I love it. Yeah! If I don’t like the wash basin, I can’t help but wipe it clean when it is dirty. Anyway, I think the real thing of the hotel is better than the pictures, and the various details are able to highlight its high-level sense.
Secondly, the hotel service is also first-class. Everyone is very polite and enthusiastic. Even the driver who came to pick us up in the morning of the tour group said that the hotel you booked was good and the staff were very friendly. The hotel’s breakfast is also excellent, rich in variety, and the rice noodles are very good. It is better than what I have eaten outside. An aunt will ask you what to drink, and then I will make it for you and put it on the table, which is touching. Our package also sent two glasses of cocktails, sitting in the bar upstairs to drink, I think I am an elegant urban nobleman hahahaha.

CIAO酒店的服務無與倫比。工作人員不遺餘力地確保我住得舒適和難忘。無論是安排交通、推薦當地景點，還是簡單地微笑問候，他們始終樂於助人。

CIAO的客房乾淨無比。它們不僅設計精美、傢俱豪華，而且清潔無比。很明顯，工作人員以維護客房清潔為榮，這點讓我非常感激。

我住宿期間的一個亮點是酒店提供的拍照服務。工作人員安排了一位專業攝影師在壯麗的桂林風景背景下為我拍照。這是一次如此獨特而特別的體驗，讓我終身難忘。

總的來説，我在CIAO的住宿簡直完美無缺。出色的服務、乾淨的客房以及令人驚歎的拍照服務使這家酒店成為桂林真正的一顆明珠。我無法再推薦它了，我已經迫不及待要再次光臨了。

一家融合了藝術、摩登、個性的輕奢酒店，真的每一個地方都巨巨巨出片📷

☑️早餐和下午茶☕️都好吃又好拍 （大堂吧）

☑️無邊泳池感覺與桂林山水都無縫銜接了，站在那裡拍照都像一幅畫 （無邊泳池）

☑️站在下面的時候真的有被震撼到，夢幻水晶般的穹頂，宛若童話 （琉璃銀杏葉穹頂）

☑️此刻才是享受真正的放鬆💆放空自己好好感受身體帶來的觸感吧 （水療吧）

☑️名媛的宴會廳，真的很美，白天也可以來，別有一番風景 （天空吧）

酒店整體的調性都非常的高級，特別是一樓的大廳，拍照很好看，外面的無邊泳池也很高級，7樓餐廳白天下午茶晚上餐廳，很適合閨蜜小聚和情侶約會。

位置離各個景點也是很近，打車過去十塊，太香啦！

酒店的服務設施也非常先進，服務也很積極，是一次非常好的體驗🤭

來桂林玩，發現的寶藏酒店，給姐妹們推薦！
酒店位於桂林市內核心地段，灕江河畔邊
採用意大利輕奢簡約設計與桂林本土原素相融合，拍照📷很出片
工作人員都很貼心，有求必應，這一點讓在旅遊中的我感受到了温暖☀
很適合年輕人入住打卡，很好看的打卡點有:
一樓遇·大堂吧，穹頂，氛圍感拉滿，輕奢風格好喜歡🙊

酒店的Spa還是不錯的 精油有比較有廣西特色的桂花香 技師手法很好
房間裝修屬於極簡風 乾淨整齊 床挺舒服的 衞生間比較驚艷 一體式雙水池 個人認為是本次廣西之行幾個城市裡麪居住環境最舒適的一個酒店

一進入酒店大堂，就被其寬敞明亮、裝飾考究的環境所吸引。前台接待人員的熱情和專業讓我們迅速完成了入住手續，並且還貼心地為我們提供了周邊景點的旅遊指南，讓我們對接下來的行程有了更好的規劃。

我們被安排在一間面向湖景的房間，打開窗户就可以看到寧靜美麗的湖面和遠處的山巒，景色令人心曠神怡。房間內部裝修現代而不失温馨，大床舒適寬敞，高質量的床上用品確保了我們一夜好眠。浴室內的熱水充沛，洗去了我們一天的疲勞。

酒店提供的早餐豐盛可口，無論是新鮮的水果、烘焙的麪包，還是熱騰騰的雞蛋和培根，都讓我們的味蕾得到了滿足。用餐區域乾淨整潔，服務員的態度親切友好，使我們的用餐體驗非常愉快。

此外，酒店為自駕遊客人提供了充足的停車位，使我們的車輛在夜間也得到了妥善的安放。酒店的位置便利，無論是前往附近的自然步道進行徒步，還是驅車前往市中心探索，都極為方便。

總的來説，這次自駕出遊選擇入住這家酒店是一次非常明智的決定。它不僅提供了一個舒適的休息環境，更為我們的旅途增加了許多美好的回憶。無論您是尋求休閑放鬆，還是探險旅行，我都會極力推薦這家酒店作為您的理想之選。

首先出發前我要告訴大家，1月底的桂林非常冷🥶濕冷！平均氣温在5度左右，寶子們一定一定要帶好棉服，羽絨服，暖寶寶，秋衣秋褲以及各種💊！
落地桂林後我入住的酒店在市中心，機場有直達大巴人均20，如果人多我建議網約車，桂林還是非常好打車的🚕
我是10點落地11點到酒店起了個早所以到酒店很累不管三七二十一我先補一覺，不然一個下午都沒精神，不得不説我提前做功課定的酒店果然很舒服，雖然是三線城市但這家酒店絕對做到了一線城市酒店的水平，泳池，健身房，spa房等設施齊全，而且服務態度特別好，讓我對桂林人民好感加倍，房間也很不錯，長髮落地窗外面就是江景，桂林好風光一覽無遺，早餐也是自助且豐富，對了還有一點就是這家酒店在市中心，離景點和商圈都很近打車10元左右（桂林打車🚖巨巨巨便宜）
總之抵達🛬️桂林的第一天還是非常愉快滴😄

🏞️視野：酒店房一整片的落地大窗看江景，桂林山水甲天下，就像一幅畫一樣鑲嵌在酒店房間～

窗邊就是灕江，看着車流，看看窗外淅瀝瀝的下雨，真的不想走了……
旅行就是這樣，找個舒適的度假酒店，換個地方睡覺～

來這裏非常有親切感，幾乎每月來一次，都會下榻該酒店，出門最重要的就是住得舒服這次我又選擇了灕江江畔的俏CIAO酒店環境我非常喜歡這裏不像酒店
反而更像一個藝術館
每一處都充滿了高級和設計感
一
•給姊妹們推薦幾個拍照超出片的地方
♥大堂
大堂彷彿就是濃縮的藝術展和畫展
⑦辰 天空吧
頂樓的天空吧可以一覽桂林美景
還能享受下午茶哦～
♥無辺泳池
無邊的泳池太有度假氛圍了

遇·大堂吧，簡直是藝術與豪華的完美結合。裝修超華麗，一看就是巴黎時尚感滿滿。左手邊的江景無邊泳池更是一道靚麗的風景線，泡在水裡，享受着桂林美景，真是太舒服了。

辰·天空吧，在7樓，簡直是高級到飛起。設計贊到沒話説，像是進入了一個時尚大片。在這裏品味美酒，看着灕江的夜景，真是讓人陶醉。
在這裏的穹頂，是用14000片銀杏葉裝點的藝術傑作。每一片葉子都好像在講述着桂林的傳奇，太讚了。

俏Ciao酒店的江景、設計、服務，每一樣都讓旅行變得酷炫又難忘。

msg:訂的韻灕江景房，正對江景景色很不錯，可以看到穿山，早起的話也可以看到日出，酒店不大但蠻別緻的，有很多小心思，晚上酒吧的雞尾酒也很不錯，用車服務也能安排妥當。拖鞋是是此行訂的三家酒店裡麪最舒服的（儘管其他兩家價格double不止）😅 唯一不足的是空調風會吹到人，開高了熱，開低了又有點冷。

msg:訂的不是江景房，補差價升級了臨江的房間，景色很美，房間挺大，很温馨，隔音效果還可以，另外房間空調聲音大了一點，其他還不錯。贈送的泡澡精油很舒服，很香，退房時還贈送一瓶，很nice，下次再來！

msg:酒店很滿意，訂的是安靜的房間，房間很大，很有格調，很温馨，很乾凈。從大堂副理到客房服務員服務都很好，很熱情，笑容很甜美，主動給我們介紹和規劃旅行線路，值得點贊。贈送的下午茶和咖啡很香，很不錯，餐廳環境也還可以，十月天氣很涼爽，户外視野無敵，臨江景色很美。提個小建議:節假日早餐時間可以稍微延長一點呢！

msg:訂的房間乾淨又舒服，周邊吃喝玩都挺方便的，商圈和景區基本都是1～2公里左右，打個車10分鐘到達，象鼻山、穿山、塔山都在附近，酒店也是在灕江邊上，環境優美風景如畫。
