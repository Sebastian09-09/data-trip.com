The staff were very attentative to our needs and with a late checkout, met our needs for an airport transfer. Swimming pool was ideal for our son. The one disappointment was the dining service, as advertised in our room was nonexistent other than the Chinese restaurant which had poor ambience, suited for a wedding party than for a family of 3.Breakfast buffet was very sufficient.

From the perspective of service, there is no enthusiasm at all, and indifference runs through it. Except for the waiter who checked in at the lobby, none of the hotel staff would take the initiative to greet me when they met. Even the waiter working in the front office saw that the door could not be opened, and just glanced at it.
The bath water was hot and cold. If it was winter, I might catch a cold. Two pairs of slippers were the same color, and two toothbrushes were also the same color. So, don't think too much about other details.
What's annoying is the charging pile. When I contacted the hotel, I was clearly told that there was a charging pile, but it was often occupied by oil trucks, so charging depended on luck. In fact, none of the charging piles were easy to use. I changed three, and then observed the two next to it that seemed to be charging, but they were actually unusable. When I reported it to the front desk, the front desk staff also vowed that if one or two could not be charged, you can change it. God knows, I have replaced three of them, one of them is broken, and the other two were suspended when others were charging.
Overall, this hotel is really poorly managed and has poor service. If there is any advantage, it is that the buckwheat pillow I asked for extra is quite comfortable.

It is especially suitable to take a walk in the evening and early morning or fly a kite on the lawn. Suggested itinerary for a two-day tour. D1. Check in in the afternoon and drive to the nearby Dangkou Ancient Town for a walk and a meal. Enjoy the night view for dinner and then return to the hotel. D2. After breakfast, go shopping. After checking out, go to the Stone Museum, Wetland Park or Fishing Grounds. There are many lawns and rivers nearby, and the green vegetation is good. Many locals come to take a picnic under the canopy. It is a happy time.

Radisson Blu Lianghong Wetland Park is a very cost-effective resort hotel. The order was a Superior King Room, and the hotel upgraded it to a suite and gave us a ticket to Lianghong Wetland Park. The guest room environment and hygiene were neat and tidy. The lawns, trees, and Jiangnan garden-style structures inlaid around the junction of the east and west main buildings and the lobby left a deep impression on us. The hotel staff were warm and polite; in short, it was worth the trip.

Come back in spring, and there will definitely be green everywhere, winding water flowing, and pavilions will definitely be more beautiful! 
The guest room was renovated on the basis of the previous one. The room is very large, especially the bathroom, which has four separate sections for shower, squat toilet, bathtub, and wash basin. It feels like it is enough for a whole family!

msg:Stayed in Phase II. If you drive, don't enter from Feifeng Road. Phase I and Phase II are not connected. When I checked in, I asked the front desk that the construction of Phase I would probably be completed by the end of the year. The main facilities of the hotel are concentrated in Phase I, including swimming, so Phase II feels relatively deserted. Except for the guest rooms and banquet hall in the main building and the breakfast restaurant next to the main building, other buildings are basically empty, and there are not many guests during the National Day holiday.

The overall feeling of the hotel design style is quite good, but the location may be relatively remote, at the junction of Wuxi and Suzhou. The only lively place around is probably in Dangkou Ancient Town, and there is a wetland park next to it. If you are not driving by yourself, to be honest, I don't recommend this hotel because it is not convenient to travel.

After staying for three days, the overall feeling is still good, but the staff give people a cold feeling, and the enthusiasm for work is not very high, perhaps because there are too few guests. I don't know if this is the reason, but the breakfast variety is not too many and the taste is average, which is not up to the hotel's star standard. Although breakfast ends at 11 o'clock, if you go at 10 o'clock, some popular dishes are gone and will not be replenished (such as Milk Wuxi Xiaolong and the like). There is still a lot of room for improvement.

We are very touched by the attitude of work. We are directed at Mr. Zhang's thoughtful service and will definitely come again in the future! Furthermore, the design of the hotel likes it very much. The resort hotel in the original ecology satisfies my preference of being pro-nature. For dining, the mandarin fish in Wufeng Chinese Restaurant meets our tastes, and the breakfast is also very rich. The waiters here are also very friendly. It takes about 10 minutes to go to Dangkou Ancient Town and Wetland Park in the surrounding area. In addition, the ticket to the Rose Garden given by Mr. Zhang is very good. The Achnatherum splendens there is the best I have seen so far. In short, a beautiful encounter.

msg:I encountered a flight delay on a business trip to Wuxi late, so I chose a hotel close to the airport in advance, which was about 15 minutes away by car. The requirements for booking a hotel are relatively high, paying attention to the environment, cleanliness, and the attitude of the waiters. Compared with many hotels, I have stayed at Radisson Hotel abroad and I have a good impression. This Radisson in Wuxi is the most cost-effective hotel among hotels near the airport. The hotel has a long history of opening, but the score is very high. After the real experience, I feel that the hardware strength is not ordinary.
The landscaping environment, with the characteristics of the Jiangnan water town, is very quiet. It is surrounded by green plants in the morning and evening. Whether it is a walk in the garden or a jog, it is a pleasant and pleasant thing. After the evening arrived, the waiter helped to check in, and took a trip to send a running route map to solve the ironing problem and was very satisfied.
The hotel informed me in advance and helped me upgrade the executive suite. Because I booked a package, the travel time was relatively rushed, and I couldn’t experience the fun of picking grapes in the package. The hotel negotiated with the Ctrip platform and contacted the vineyard to give me a box of the day. The grapes picked 🍇 once again praised the service quality. When I entered the door, I turned on the air conditioner and said that I was worried that the grapes would go bad. Welcome fruits and pastries.
I feel that the room has a large space. Due to the high height adjus**ent of the building, the furniture and toilets are older. It may be old, but it is cleaner. The only disadvantage is that the toiletries are simpler, but sufficient. There are many choices for breakfast, the quality is good, the environment is very comfortable, the service staff is very good, and it is very quiet.
When I first arrived in the evening, I closed the curtains and couldn't see the scenery outside the window. I opened the curtains when I woke up in the morning, but I was amazed. I thought I was back to my home in the golf complex, away from the noise of the city, so rare and clean. He Anning is what I am familiar with, yearning for and pursuing deep in my heart.
If you want to give a comment, it is: a hotel worth taking the family to visit again.

The front desk brother attaches great importance to the warm service attitude. On the day of arrival, I also introduced the hotel very enthusiastically. It feels good, because we took it for a few months. My baby stayed together, the hotel front desk brother equipped us with an air purifier, which made us feel warm and happy, and the dishes in the Chinese restaurant are also good. Very happy trip

It is under maintenance and there is no good view. Except for dining in the hotel, it is not convenient to eat in the surrounding area. It takes at least ten minutes to drive out, but there are wetland parks around you to drive over or walk over. 80 points overall

msg:The experience was very bad. When I arrived at the hotel, I parked my car on the right side of the lobby entrance because I was alone with a child and needed to get things. It would not affect the entry and exit of other vehicles. Suddenly an old man rushed out and yelled at you. The car can't be parked and so on. I said I would check in first and move it without affecting it. He was still making noises and was very aggressive. This is a situation I have never encountered in so many hotels. Even if it doesn't work, You can say it in a gentle tone. I am not breaking any laws. I feel that in order to save money, the hotel hires older people. Even if it is not a five-star hotel, it lacks quality. I will not come here again!

1、到酒店門口也沒有服務員幫忙拿行李，全程自助，感覺去了一家兩星的小旅館。
2、由於YQ，兩年沒來了，這家酒店的早餐飛漲，149一位，之前都在60左右，也不知道他們哪來的勇氣在這種經濟形勢下漲價。沒辦法，早餐衹能叫外賣對付。
3、房間空調真的不行，怎麼開也就20度，整晚冷死。

從2015年起就經常入住樑笙。大多是週末休閑，也有為乘坐蘇南機場第二天一早出港的航班特意入住，雖然從工作地到機場也就一個小時的路程，就為其休閑放鬆的氛圍。
園林式的酒店環境，精緻而幽靜。早晚散步其中，不亞於小遊江南園林。

上月的一次入住，遇董先生接待，給我們升級到行政套房，真是意外的驚喜。非常感謝酒店對常客的細心服務。

如果用一句話描述入住的個人體驗：酒店的服務與五星國際品牌和這個環境並不相配。
不知道是不是疫情的蕭條影響，感覺整個酒店員工的狀態普遍透着一種經營不景氣企業特有的“事不關己”的情緒和表現出未受過培訓的行為意識。
最典型莫過於酒店的“門面”—前台，每次和前台女服務員的溝通，冷冷的態度似乎是在提醒為什麼要來住這家酒店…
幸好4號上午一位總機接線員的主動服務給了一絲暖心。
遺憾了，這樣的度假村，有自然的環境，沒有人的温度…

作為度假型酒店，酒店本身就是一個小園林，健身房、游泳池、SPA館都有。周邊外賣很多可以送上門，在酒店裡泡一天都沒問題。

msg:The security guards at the hotel had a bad attitude from the moment we entered the gate. They drove the driver away before the car had even stopped, and they ignored the luggage. The front desk was indifferent. When I asked where to print, I was told that I could print one sheet for free, and it would cost more than six yuan. The room facilities were old, the wires of the electrical appliances were exposed, and the carpet was very dirty. The climax came when I ordered takeout. The takeout man was blocked by the concierge at the door and was not allowed to enter. He was not allowed to put it on the table after the concierge said that he would take it later. The takeout man urged me to go back to the hotel to get it. The concierge said it was a food safety issue. Then can't you buy a robot and send a disclaimer to the door? Poor service is poor service. What else can I say? I am a top member of Ctrip for many years. This is my first time writing a review. The only bright spot of this hotel is that it is bad enough. It deserves the name of a five-star bad review hotel. Except for the grand lobby, all other aspects are not as good as the two hundred yuan Home Inn.
