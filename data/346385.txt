Find hair in the bath-kit. The laundry I highly paid for returned with a really bad smell that I have to wash them again. We were introduced 'two free laundry service' instead of 'two pieces of laundry' 7socks+6clothes for 110‚Ç¨ but it's not a big deal anymore. 
The funny thing is that I gived 7pairs of socks which were given back all with holes on the top of them, I thrown away some pairs...none of them helped with luggage...need more attention on details and English communication for all the staff

msg:The hotel has a nice entrance the concierge  are really respectful and are willing to answer any questions in Chinese and in English. The reception area is beautiful you can see the Shanghai skyscrapers and the bund view from there. I was a little disappointed by the offer at reception. It was my birthday weekend and they couldn‚Äôt get even offer me complimentary breakfast this was shocking for such a high quality hotel. Furthermore, the check in process was below average:
1. There was no welcome drinks not even a bottle of water.
2. I had to later ask for a toothpaste they should have offered me.
3. They did not know even take me to my room I had to drag my suitcases by myself. 

When you pay over 2300 RMB you are paying for the hotel to pay attention to detail and thus expect more. The room was really comfortable however, the shower had some mould and was also difficult to realise how to use it. 

Breakfast was okay they have a wide selection of food. However the service was shocking I sat there waiting for 20 mins after I had order my tea before someone came over to help me order eggs. The manager later apologised but for a place with high standards and on my birthday this disappointing.

The two duty managers Geoffrey and Winky at the front desk were enthusiastic and professional, giving us a very good stay experience. The breakfast was rich in variety, the ingredients were exquisite, and the taste was also very good.
The most important thing is that the scenery is really beautiful, and it is different in the morning, noon and evening. I have recommended it to my friends around me to stay at Park Hyatt when they come to Shanghai.

msg:Park Hyatt Shanghai is located in the heart of Lujiazui, the most prosperous area in Shanghai, and in the Shanghai World Financial Center, one of Shanghai's absolute landmarks. From the wide driveway on the first floor, the hidden three-entry gate, to the restrained use of lighting, it creates a feeling of "home" for guests in the most luxurious area of ‚Äã‚ÄãShanghai.
The front desk is located on the 87th floor. You can see the Jinmao Tower and the Oriental Pearl Tower when you exit the elevator, and appreciate the prosperity of Lujiazui from another angle. The guest room has been upgraded to a corner room. Although the facilities have been worn out for more than ten years, the design of the room is still worth living in today. The simple design style and restrained use of lighting emphasize the sense of life and home, rather than the luxurious and complicated experience. The windows do not choose large floor-to-ceiling windows, which adds a sense of luxury cruise ship private room. At night, the lights of the entire hotel are dimmed, creating a quiet moment, allowing guests to focus their attention on the prosperous night view outside the window.
Looking forward to the next stay experience.

I was stunned at the first sight of entering the room... A cheap style of a fast hotel hit me... Is this a five-star hotel? ? ? The big bed is so simple that I doubt my life... Is this Hanting? Or Home Inn? Or Super 8? You want to play with the simple style, right? Just tatami! No need for a bed... And the Japanese style has become a feature... The carpet is not a serious carpet...
I don‚Äôt know what the so-called designer hotel designed? ? ? There is a socket at the head of the bed with a speaker plugged in... It‚Äôs difficult to plug in other plugsüîåüîåüîå... It‚Äôs hard to plug in, but there‚Äôs no power... I‚Äôve been tossing and turning and ended up hitting my head... It hurts so much!! It wasn‚Äôt until I saw the lamp head fall out that I realized there was this lamp at the head of the bed... Isn‚Äôt it a simple style? ? ? Why bother to get such a dispensable spotlight! Thank you for the designer's inspiration...giving guests a surprise, right!

The smart settings in the room are not as good as the simple switch settings! How nice it is to turn it on and off! It's not simple as it should be...very cumbersome...I can't adjust the lights in the room at night...it's always so dark...I'm really speechless...The bathroom is also dim...The facilities look old under the dim light...In fact, they are not old! It's an illusion caused by the dim light
The so-called Bund view room can see the Customs Bell Tower and Peace Hotel opposite. That's all! The Jinmao Grand Hyatt in front will block a large area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe view...On the contrary, it's good to see J Center...
The Century 100 restaurant on the 91st floorüç¥ has great products! Both dinner and breakfast are good! The service is also very good! The environment is amazing! Huangpu River view, Oriental Pearl Tower view, Bund view, all the scenery are included
Hotel lovers who like high floors should go to Guangzhou to live in Four Seasons Rosewood

The overall design is not outdated, but some details of the hardware are a bit old, such as light controls, toilets, sinks, etc.
I personally think it is a substitute for the J Hotel next door. Compared with other Bund hotels, the price-performance ratio is really very high.
The service and variety of breakfast are good, and the taste of Chinese food is better than that of Western food.
The swimming pool is a bit small and not next to the window, so you can't see the scenery when swimming.

msg:Generally, I don't comment easily. I usually choose Marriott hotels when I go out. But because my kids want to stay in a high-altitude hotel, I chose Park Hyatt Shanghai after comprehensive consideration. After staying there, I just felt that it really didn't meet the hardware and services that a luxury hotel should have. The only thing left in this hotel is the view! 
First of all, when I checked in on the first day, I asked for a floor as high as possible. The front desk staff said that the high-rise rooms were being cleaned, or the low-rise rooms. I said if they were being cleaned, I would go around and wait for them to be cleaned. I asked again how I would know when the cleaning was done. You would call to notify me, but the staff said that they were busy today and I didn't have time to call. You can call the front desk to ask yourself! Haha, is this the service that a hotel of Park Hyatt's level should have? ? ? I don't even have time to make a phone call! 
Secondly, after finally checking in, I called to ask for a disposable bathtub bag, and they told me that there was none. I have stayed in various luxury hotels, big and small, whether it is Marriott, St. Regis, InterContinental or Hilton, etc. This is the first time I have encountered a luxury hotel without free disposable bathtub bags! 
Finally, the breakfast in this hotel is really not good. There are really few varieties and the taste is not very good. Maybe because there are many foreigners in the hotel, most of the dishes are in line with the tastes of foreigners! 
Many people say that the rooms of Park Hyatt Shanghai are in the style of a fast hotel, but I think the style is actually OK, but I hope the service can be improved. It is really unworthy of its reputation. Anyway, I will not choose this hotel again in the future! ! !

msg:My Eyes on Shanghai Park Hyatt Cloud Mirror Package
During the Chinese New Year, we stayed at the Park Hyatt Shanghai again. As we advocate healthy living, we still chose the cloud mirror package. Yunjing: As the name suggests, you are in the clouds, enjoying life in a beautiful wonderland... Although it has been open for 15 years, this old-style super five-star hotel still exudes a noble a**osphere. Based on the spacious Chinese-style courtyard design concept, Mr. Tony Chi uses soft white, beige and natural cotton, linen, stone and wood to create a garden in the room, which serves as an ideal venue for private gatherings of family or friends. He imagined the courtyard as a holy place in the clouds for self-cultivation. With a zigzag floor design and a view for each room, you can become a Shanghai socialite here, or you can appreciate the modern skyscraper design here... In short, everyone from children to the elderly can find their own place here. One place... From the moment you get off the bus, you feel the enthusiasm. Thank you to Mandy, the front desk manager, for her careful arrangements and a gift from Park HyattüéÅ-little koala for the children; Mr. Xie at the front desk knows that the children have to do their homework and is considerate. The desk lamp was delivered. The fruit in the room is also the most meaningful "orangeüçä" for us Cantonese people during the Spring Festival. Choosing "Yunjing" stems from our concept of healthy life. Yunjing's dishes are mainly healthy and light meals, but as long as you don't lack anything you want, you won't be sloppy. Exquisitely cooked and delicious. From appetizers, soups, a combination of Chinese and Western staples, desserts, pre-dinner wine, after-dinner coffee or tea... As a business person, you can work here every day, do small brainstorming or chat with close friends. No matter which one you choose, the warm environment of Yunjing and the gentle and beautiful reception of MIRANDA will make you feel at home. This is Park Hyatt, your "home away from home" in Shanghai. Thanks again to Mandy's team for their thoughtfulness and warmth. The children miss Park Hyatt again before they go home.

msg:This time I tried the Pujiang View Room. Mandy and Geoffrey were very nice and considerate! ! Helped me with the upgrade.

Location: One of the three suites in Lujiazui. It is a better choice for watching the sunset and overlooking the entire city landscape.
Hardware: The level is almost the same as a few years ago, and the room is very well maintained. I feel that the interior decoration of this hotel is a bit similar to Tokyo Park Hyatt
Service: Not bad, but not very good. Everything is there, but there won‚Äôt be any more surprises.
Disadvantages: As other posts said, you can really hear gusts of wind at night due to the high floor; and the gym is hidden behind the swimming pool, which is really small and you can‚Äôt even find a place to put a yoga mat. Unforgettable experience: First, in the room I watched the whole process of the sunset, which was really beautiful; secondly, the cherry blossoms downstairs have been blooming very well recently, and I came back from dinner in the evening to catch up with the three-piece night cherry blossom viewing set; thirdly, this swimming pool is really beautiful and easy to swim in. The lounge chair by the window is really comfortable; fourthly, I feel like their breakfast has become so delicious now that I really want to eat it till I eat it~

msg:I chose to stay at the Park Hyatt on New Year‚Äôs Day this year to fulfill my family‚Äôs tradition of climbing mountains every New Year. In this way, the hotel experience in the local three-piece suite is also completed successfully.
There is indeed a big gap between the hotel's hardware and J's, but after all, the price difference is a lot, and it has been open for so many years, so the maintenance is pretty good. The key services are still quite good, matching the Hyatt brand. Because there were a lot of people staying and the room was not ready yet, we arranged to go to the executive lounge to rest and wait.
The location of the river view room is not facing the Oriental Pearl Tower and the Bund, but you can see the Yangpu Bridge and the North Bund. The reception hall in the lobby offers views of the century-old Bund across the river.
There were not many people at the Skyline Swimming Pool, most of them probably went out to see the night view of Lujiazui. It's quite pleasant to take a swim or take a sauna.
For dinner, we had a simple meal in the hotel's executive lounge. Although there were not many varieties, the taste was still good. The variety of wines provided by Happy Hour was quite rich.
When we arrived for breakfast, we knew that the occupancy rate was quite high the night before, with many locals like us. I ordered a bowl of noodles at the semi-buffet and it tasted good, but I was a little anxious after waiting. Anyway, the overall experience is still very good.

The manager on duty at night admitted the mistake and had a good attitude. He offered us compensation, upgraded us to a nearby room for the convenience of staying overnight, and suggested that he could I used the minibar for free. I accepted the handling attitude and measures that night, and it was already late, so I changed rooms and continued to stay. But I didn‚Äôt expect that the minibar would give me a second shock. The unopened potato chips turned out to be spoiled. My girlfriend ate a few slices without knowing the taste. For comparison, she also bought the same potato chips from another room. Finally, she was convinced that the potato chips had gone bad and the taste was seriously wrong. She took the spoiled potato chips when she checked out. , the manager on duty even quibbled that the taste was like this, and that she should have taken down another bag of normal-flavored potato chips. Her attitude towards her was really angry and helpless. If there is a problem with the food, it will be the hotel's responsibility. , I took the expired potato chips and hoped that the hotel would conduct a comprehensive inspection of the same batch of food. The manager even wanted to quibble. I was really angry. Finally, he offered to give points as compensation. During the whole process, I didn‚Äôt even hear from him that he wanted to accept the food. Come down and check the minibar carefully. Guests who check in later will want to check the status of the food by themselves! ! !

Enjoy the "Yunjing" privilege for two people: overall it is average, there are not many types of dishes, there are about three hot dishes, the others are cold meals, desserts, breads, there are several kinds of drinks and fruits, there are some types of wine in the evening, and you can eat during the few days you stay. Not many people

Facilities: There are sockets on only one side of the bed, and the space is occupied by Bluetooth speakers, making charging very inconvenient.

Service: The service was good before the problem occurred and on the second night. Because it was an anniversary, cakes and wine were given, and a thermometer was given for fever. Thank you very much, but the feeling when checking out was disappointing. Overall discounted.

Environment: The scenery is quite good. You can overlook the Huangpu River and see the bustling traffic and neon lights of the Magic City.

Enjoy 2 pieces of laundry during your stay: Have not experienced this yet

The area and view were great, but the decoration design of the room was really unflattering, which made me Not even interested in taking pictures. After entering the door, I found that there were mirrors everywhere. There were entire large mirrors on the four wardrobe doors and the bathroom door. It was difficult to identify the direction. The light wood-colored desk next to the window looked very simple. There was a huge new Chinese-style black dining table in the middle of the room, and the bed The bed and bed are made of white soft-covered headboards, there are stainless steel railings beside the windows, and pure white roller curtains are used for the floor-to-ceiling windows. It looks simple and shabby, hahaha, forgive me for my venomous tongue! This is the first time I have seen a five-star hotel with this kind of mixed style. I don‚Äôt know where the designer was hired from. It‚Äôs really a failure. The overall lighting in the room is dim, but fortunately the night view of the city outside the window adds to the beauty of the room. Although it is not perfect, what I am quite satisfied with is the hotel service. The old five-star hotel is still very good. I called a day in advance to ask about my needs, and the response was very fast when picking up and dropping off luggage. Knowing that there were children, I even took the initiative to help with an extra bed. The details were well done. Overall satisfied üëçThe restaurant is beautiful when there is sunlight. Visually, the floor-to-ceiling windows should be more than ten meters high, which is very bright. Recommended experience.

msg:I have stayed in the worst Park Hyatt in China, even worse than Suzhou Park Hyatt. The design and decoration of the hotel are very good, thanks to the design by master Ji Yutang. However, such a good location, such a good design and decoration, and such a good brand were completely discredited by such poor service. It was already around 3:30 pm when we arrived at the hotel. In principle, the normal check-in process is to check in at 3 pm. We have to ensure that guests check in. If there is no room, we should upgrade the guest to a spare room. However, when we arrived at this hotel, the service was really poor. The front desk clerk who just arrived to check in did not apologize for this, but even treated him with an impatient attitude. The guest was persuaded to leave, which was very unprofessional. Even the service attitude was not up to the standards expected of a luxury hotel. Based on this level of service, I suspected that she was staying at the Hyatt Escape brand. The luggage tag she was given was not accepted, which directly meant "Don't leave now." "Give it to me" "or else you'll lose it" and then just left me alone and ignored me. Is the front desk of a luxury hotel owned by Hyatt so professional? What do you do during your usual training time? They didn't even collect luggage tags. Shouldn't the normal procedure be to collect the guests' luggage tags and then send the guests' luggage to the cleaned room? ? ? After about 40 minutes, I asked another front desk staff. Her attitude was still very good, but she still refused to give me a room for various reasons, saying that there was no room, and it was this time, and she didn't even tell me when the room would be given. , I asked and said I didn‚Äôt know. I didn‚Äôt know when I asked three questions. It was really annoying. It wasn‚Äôt until about 30 minutes passed that I couldn‚Äôt bear it anymore. I went directly to the front desk to ask what the situation was. The room was not given at the stipulated check-in time of 3 p.m. Forget it, why didn't you even say when the room would be given to you? What do you mean? Until then, the front desk did not give a specific time. I really don‚Äôt understand the level of the management team of Park Hyatt Shanghai. The management is extremely poor, turning the luxury hotel Park Hyatt under Hyatt into a fast Hyatt Escape. It feels like this It's really unskilled to be perfunctory and fool the guests. It's extremely excessive. It's the first time I've seen this kind of service in a luxury hotel. . . . This is my first time staying at a luxury hotel that refuses to give me a room after 3pm and can't even tell me when the room will be given. I feel that neither Hyatt nor Grand Hyatt would do this. The whole time from checking in to getting the room took about an hour and a half. The Chinese restaurant service is non-existent throughout the entire process. If my first stay at the Park Hyatt was in Shanghai, I believe I would first avoid the Park Hyatt when choosing hotels in the future. One thing to say, the room design of this hotel is still very strong. Although it opened in 2008, it is still very avant-garde. However, such a good design has lost its favor under the influence of such bad service. It is not qualified to compare with Park Hyatt in Hangzhou, Beijing, Shenzhen and Guangzhou.

but! The front desk service and hardware are really at the level of the legendary guest house! When we arrived at 3:30, we had to wait until 6 o'clock to get the room, and there was almost no free rest area, so we were asked to wait in the swimming pool rest area! ! Extremely funny! Later, the security guard at the elevator entrance suggested that we go to Yunjing (Executive Lounge) to rest...
After waiting for an hour, I finally realized what I was doing and called Ctrip to ask for help. Unexpectedly, the effect was very good and I immediately arranged it. Moreover, Ctrip even took the initiative to pay a small amount of money and apologize. Only then did I feel a little bit of what it is like to stay at the Park Hyatt. Serve.
In general, it's not worth it. It's okay to live with children for a novelty, but otherwise it's not necessary. There is a wide range of options at this price.

  Although there were a lot of people at breakfast, the food was replenished in a timely manner, and the weather was good and the view was amazing!
  During your stay, all hotel colleagues will greet you and take the initiative to help. The price and brand are worthy of the hotel, and the scenery is impeccable!
The only drawback is that there are too many people during the Spring Festival. I will try it again if I have the opportunity in the future!

msg:The unrivaled view of the Bund Bay of Huangpu River in Shanghai is the biggest selling point of the hotel. Of course, you can only have a clear view from the hotel lobby and the restaurant on the 91st floor. At the check-in reception, the service staff had a good and professional attitude. Disadvantages: the check-in space was too small and the queuing method was unreasonable; the processing time was long. Breakfast, overall good. The room is fully equipped and new. Disadvantages: The hot and cold adjusting device of the bathroom shower is in an unreasonable position (some guests did not see it at all), causing some guests to think that the water temperature is too hot or too cold and cannot adjust it. The swimming pool is good, the water temperature is a bit cold. Dinner at Yunjing Restaurant is okay. In the afternoon, there are only a few fruits and food. There are many drinks, especially foreign wine.

msg:The second tallest hotel in Shanghai, height is its biggest feature. The interior was designed by ********* designer Ji Yutang, focusing on Jiangnan style, but it easily looks old over time.
The lobby is on the 87th floor, the space is cramped, and the lobby bar overlooks the Bund. The swimming pool is on the 85th floor and there are few people in the morning. The room had a strange smell and noise, but the bath was very comfortable.
Breakfast is at Century 100 on the 91st floor, and the quality can only be compared to an ordinary five-star hotel.
There are only a few free parking spaces on the ground, and the underground parking lot costs 15 yuan an hour.

Facilities: The light switch is not friendly to the elderly. It is all in English and a bit difficult to adjust. There was no hot water kettle, so we had to call the front desk to bring it to us.

I also went to eat the Cantonese food upstairs. The soy sauce chicken and taro dishes were very good. There are many types of breakfast, mainly Western style.

On the last day, I moved to the well-established Park Hyatt. It was indeed like a guest house during the day, but at night when the lights are turned off, it is definitely the most invincible in Shanghai. The view, the room is on the 80th floor, there was a bit of tinnitus when I went upstairs, but overall the experience was good. I was not expecting to receive the sugar orange as a gift. It is a fruit with a lot of meaning in winter. The room view was average at the beginning. I told the front desk that the view was not good and they upgraded me to a room with a better view for free. The only drawback was the water in the room and the hair dryer, which was so cheap. When I got up in the morning to catch a flight, the Philips hair dryer couldn't dry it at all. If you‚Äôre in a five-star hotel, you‚Äôd better switch to Dyson. Everything else is very good. What‚Äôs worth mentioning is that the hotel‚Äôs slippers are not disposable at all. They are thick and comfortable to wear and the experience is quite good. I will come again next time.

Service: The service is really good. When I checked in, the lady at the front desk saw that it was my birthday soon and arranged to send a cake and drinks. She was really considerate. The service was thoughtful, meticulous and surprising.
Hygiene: The countertop next to the bathtub can be wiped more carefully
Facilities: The wellness center is very good, the locker room is very well-equipped, and there is also a sauna room. It is very enjoyable to use the sauna on the 85th floor. Try to avoid the peak hours of the swimming pool, because the swimming pool is not big and there are many children. What's strange is that the children swim sideways or float in the middle, and adults don't care. It's really hard to understand.

When we arrived in the early hours of the morning, we were not allowed to check in and were charged an extra night. The attitude of the waiters was extremely bad. Everyone had dark faces. It was very strange.
Early the next morning, to be precise, early every morning, someone kept knocking on the door and ringing the doorbell, asking if they wanted to clean the room and asking if they wanted to do laundry. The most dramatic thing was that they asked them to do laundry, but they didn‚Äôt wash it and told me they couldn‚Äôt do it. Every day after that They all knocked on the door and asked if they wanted to do laundry and asked for the room to be cleaned on the first day. When they came back, it was not cleaned and they called the front desk. They had a very bad attitude and said they didn‚Äôt know anything about me. There was also a recording. I have never stayed in a five-star hotel like this. I will write an email to the headquarters to complain about this rubbish hotel and it will be banned forever. Everyone, please pay attention to lightning protection.

The location is excellent, it only takes a few minutes to walk to the top floor of Shanghai Center for sightseeing. Things to do, eat, shop, and transportation nearby are all very convenient!
The hotel is low-key and luxurious. When you enter the two automatic doors, you will immediately feel quiet and relaxed. A light fragrance pours into your nose, which is comfortable. The hotel facilities are high-end and private.
The hotel service is very good. Whether it's the receptionist downstairs, the hotel front desk staff, the pool staff, the room service staff, or the elevator staff, they are all very professional and dedicated. Not disturbing guests, but showing up exactly when needed to provide service. Highly qualified staff. Special thanks to Ms. Xu at the front desk, who is capable, professional, enthusiastic, and has a good sense of proportion. The instructor and lifeguard at the hotel swimming pool are dedicated and hardworking. Thank you. I will stay here again in the future and recommend to my friends. If you go to Pudong to see a three-piece suit, stay at the Park Hyatt Hotel in the Financial Center.

It‚Äôs worth it when you see the lights come on and when you wake up in the morning and raise the curtains to see the city skyline. Although I also read the comments are positive and negative, overall I am satisfied. Some facilities and equipment can clearly see the traces of time. The swivel chair in front of the window is very comfortable. The height of the window sill is also satisfactory, and the head can just rest on it. The most satisfying thing is that I called Ctrip on the first day and hoped that the hotel would try my best to help me check in early. After all, I just landed in Shanghai from London. I didn't report too much hope, I can check in at 12 o'clock, but I actually arranged a room soon after I arrived at the hotel. Very satisfied. There are not many types of breakfast but they are all exquisite. Many meals need to be arranged by the waiter, such as omelette/coffee. Xiaolongbao and fried dumplings, which are Shanghai specialties, are quite average.

The service gap is very big, especially kind and attentive when checking in. However, the quality of the breakfast waiters is average, and their attitude towards foreign guests and extraordinary people is completely different. On the day of check-out, the tone of the call to urge us was very rude. He also mentioned on the phone that there were guests behind us and asked us to pack up and leave as soon as possible. It was very unpleasant to hear this. Although they are both older high-rise hotels, the overall experience of the Jinmao LaCrosse next door will be better. At least you're respected.

At least I didn't have any unpleasant experiences due to the service during my stay. Around 11pm, I asked the front desk to deliver water and toothbrushes, and they delivered them very quickly, and there was no delay or refusal of service. As long as there is a window seat in the breakfast room, the service staff will ask if you want a window seat. It is first come, first served. There must be something that does not match this hotel, and it should be its welcome fruit. There are a few small nectarines that are neither sweet nor sour on a small plate. Although they look good, they are indeed a bit unpleasant. proportionate. In addition, there are really people cleaning glass exterior walls at any time.

msg:Since it was the first time for my family to come to Shanghai, I deliberately chose a hotel in Pudong where you can see the landmark buildings and booked the Park Hyatt. You can indeed see the Jin Mao Tower and the Oriental Pearl Tower very close by. I personally like the style of the room, which is wooden and simple. But the lighting design is too dim and uncomfortable (of course this varies from person to person, some people just like it dark)

As for service, in fact, if you have experience in foreign hotels, you will find that the overall service awareness in China's service industry is relatively weak and not on the same level. So there's nothing to say about the service. It's nothing but nothing. There are some enthusiastic staff, but there are also some who won't even say hello when they see you. As long as it doesn't cause any problems for me, I don't have high expectations for domestic hotel services.

And the most fatal point is that the hotel has to transfer to the elevator. The lobby is on the 87th floor. Takeaways are not available. To go to the first floor, you need to transfer to the elevator. This is very, very inconvenient.

Generally speaking, at this price, you can choose other more comfortable ones, which is not recommended. Personal point of view, only for reference

At that time, the three of us who were shivering in the moderate rain outside entered the room and were immediately warmed up. Feeling happy, the next morning because I didn‚Äôt understand the air conditioner temperature control switch, I thought the air conditioner was faulty. Manager Yan Xiaojia came to the room in person, introduced the use of the switch in detail, and proposed a solution. If you are not satisfied, you can upgrade to another scenery. A better room, and to express his apology, he gave three free breakfasts. Manager Yan considers the customers and fully embodies Park Hyatt's business philosophy! Park Hyatt's hardware and software are first-rate, and Ctrip's after-sales service is remarkable!

msg:When booking the room on Ctrip, I told you in advance that the floor that can be as high as possible is almost 4,000, but the room is on the 80th floor, and the hotel starts from the 79th floor. Can you consider whether the next floor will be taken care of? Before placing the order, I have been lingering in the three hotels of the three-piece suite. After reading the reviews, I decided to choose the Park Hyatt for three consecutive days. Some comments said that there were long queues and poor service at the front desk. Yes, at least the type of room we live in is not bad, it happens to face the Huangpu River between Xiaoman waist and the syringe, and all the staff greet each other on their own initiative, without any slack happening, but for the concierge outside the first floor I feel that the hotel needs to be caught. Some concierges know to take the initiative to carry the luggage and open the door for the guests, and some don‚Äôt even call for a call, so they direct the order of the vehicles, let alone open the door, and even the door handle is not seen. He said, Landmark Hotel is the first image post, and there are indeed some employees who are slack! I would give 10 points if there is no minus for the concierge on the first floor.

msg:Stayed for two nights, the hotel is really high, the scenery is very good, I wanted to upgrade, the receptionist's suggestion is not necessary, because the lobby can be seen, there is no need to add money, so I accepted the suggestion! There is another internal elevator in the lobby to go to the guest room. Because the floor itself is high, it is always inconvenient to get in and out. The layout of the room is simple. The room is relatively large, with complete facilities and an independent bathroom. However, in such a high building, the sewer has no smell. This is really greatüëçüèªThere is a capsule coffee machine with coffee, but it‚Äôs useless, because the hotel‚Äôs breakfast is so delicious, and there are also coffee spots, which are good-looking and delicious, and the other meals are also very good, with a good view ( It looks like the 90th floor), and there are non-hotel guests who pay to eat! Because the package I bought included small cakes, fruits and tents, as shown in the picture, the cakes are too greasy, and the tent children like it! The swimming pool is also good, I didn't go into the water, it was a bit cold, the children played in the shallow water area (hot water in the shallow water area)

Surrounding environment: There are a lot of restaurants nearby, just go around to the other side on the first floor, and there is a bridge corridor with Guojin, it's good to walk around and take pictures at night

Disadvantages: Just like other comments, when we went there was also affected by the typhoon, the sound of wind and rain, it was a bit loud, and it was troublesome to transfer to the elevator, but there is no way, you can order takeaway, but you have to go downstairs to pick it up! Another thing is that every time Dabao takes the elevator, his ears feel uncomfortable, but he is fine when he returns to the high floors of the hotel. If he goes to the first floor of the hotel, his ears will feel uncomfortable for a long time.

Regret: Did not go to the Black Pearl Chinese Restaurant for dinner

Up to the on-duty manager, the luggage guy, the cleaning aunt, the lifeguards at the swimming pool, the lifeguards are very nice and polite, except for a certain front desk... a certain lady is really arrogant, indifferent and unprofessional, you don‚Äôt think that you are superior to others when you work on the 87th floor, right? No way no way ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

The water from the coffee machine turns yellow and is full of dregs. I don‚Äôt know how long it will take to clean it...

There is no air-conditioning in the floor elevator during the day, who will die of heat in summer? Although the interior decoration style of the hotel is in the style of the four walls, the elevator is really unnecessary
ps, the wet and dry separation of the toilet is good, the shower area is also large, but the steps when stepping into the bathtub are easy to knock your feet, families with children should be careful
Also, booking a room with a view of the Pujiang River is not necessarily a view of the river. The view is likely to be 10% river + 90% city view. In this situation, everyone, please find someone who can make the decision and ask to change to a river-view room. Thank you Ctrip for your continuous communication and rights protection, and thank you to the manager on duty the next day for actively handling and changing to a real river-view room.
I hope your hotel can improve and don't really become a hotel that is "nothing but the scenery" in the mouth of others. After all, there are several high-rise hotels opposite you. It's not like everyone has other options

The price of 3,000 per night does not match the corresponding services. It is not the first time to live in Park Hyatt in Shanghai. This time the experience is extremely bad, and I will never choose it again. It depends on the Oriental Pearl Riverview.

First of all, the front desk staff was very inefficient. We only got the room at 4pm and there was no apology. Then the decoration of the room is simply terrible. It is estimated that the senior manager in charge of the decoration project embezzled most of the decoration budget. One side of the wall is a large white wall painted unevenly, and the other side is a cheap PVC board, and there are mixed Wearing some cheap wallpaper that has quietly come off. There is a charging socket only on one side of the bed, which is also a complaint. Ask the front desk where the kettle is? The answer is no, let me use the coffee capsule as a kettle, what the fuk? It was the first time I learned that the coffee capsule machine can also be used as a kettle. The next day at the buffet breakfast on the 91st floor, the dining area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe restaurant was very scattered, but the dishes were too few. I asked the waiter to add some vinegar. After waiting for a long time, I gave up. The environment should have been the only selling point of this hotel. Unfortunately, yesterday and today were hazy days and I didn't see much of the view. I can't blame the hotel, but myself. I shouldn't have spent an extra 1,000 to book a room with a view. This may be the longest comment I have ever written, I hope you all will avoid it! Park Hyatt Shanghai Pudong is so bad!

msg:When the weather is good, you can overlook the river view, and there are three-piece check-in points around, which is very convenient. When it rains, the rain beating on the glass windows makes people sleepless all night.

The pillows and quilt cores in the guest rooms have a strong sweaty smell, so it is recommended to wash them regularly.

I don‚Äôt know how to describe the laundry service. The clothes sent back have no detergent or clean and fresh smell. Logically, it is not like this to send laundry at home or in the back area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe store. It is guessed that it is machine-washed in the store, and detergents such as laundry detergent have not been added because of the large amount.

The catering service has five-star praise. Whether it is an employee or a manager, they make eye contact throughout the process, greet each other politely, actively identify the needs of customers, and operate the workflow skillfully.

The swimming pool service is five-star praise, actively pay attention to guests and deliver water and towels in time.

5 star rating for front desk and concierge service.

msg:Compared with Ningbo Park Hyatt, it is a pure city high-altitude hotel. It has been in business for a few years, and the soft furnishings are well maintained, but some bathroom hardware is rusty + the coffee machine boils hot water like tears, it is inconvenient to make tea, and I have no idea about the cleanliness. There are many complaints about this point in the reviews , but it leaked after using it once~ Finally, the kettle came. 5100 is very generous. The spare parts are Yuebishi white tea series, as are the swimming pool locker rooms, and the same style as the West Bund MGM locker rooms.

The mattress is moderately soft and hard, I love it. Light button: solid circle = off, hollow circle = on, with brightness adjus**ent and delay off, it will not be blacked out all at once, but the button is only marked in English, and it is time to change it to Chinese and English. Compared with the bedroom, the bathroom has a lot of space, the bathroom is independent, the washlet is easy to use, and there is a sink, plus the double basin design for the bath, the bathtub is next to the shower, the design has a sense of age, complain The towels are placed in a box under the sink, it is difficult to determine the hygienic state of the box, and it is uncomfortable to bend over to get the towel every time. Whether it is a hand shower or a tropical rainforest, the water output is super large. The shower is similar to the dial type used in the United States. The water flow increases from small to large + the temperature ranges from hot to low. There is also a large faucet below, which I use to wash my feet ~ Except for the bedroom, the aisle and the bathroom are all in black tone, and the overall wooden elements are highlighted. I personally don't like this kind of high coldness, and the dark rubbing is not as good as the Edison. From time to time, the fa√ßade makes a beeping sound, expanding with heat and contracting with cold? Sound insulation is in place between internal rooms.

The air conditioner in the swimming pool and gym is turned on too low, causing the water in the pool to be hot, but the temperature is still low. It is not friendly to children, but it is okay for adults to swim. The temperature of the hot bubble pool by the pool is not high. The locker room is small, there are only 2 showers, and there is a high-altitude landscape sauna.

I still choose Yuexuan for dinner, and I gave zongzi for the Dragon Boat Festival. I like it for the low sweetness~ Breakfast yyds, comment separately.

The overall service is also online, provided that the reception volume is not too large~ Room service responds in a timely manner and handles problems efficiently.

Book the Oriental Pearl View Room, the night view is radiant and dazzling. The windows are wiped clean, which may be one of the best in the local skyscrapers. Unfortunately, the glass is reflective. Even if all the lights in the room are turned off, there are still other external sources of light including the light of mobile phones that interfere with taking pictures. In the early morning of the next day, I saw a beautiful sunrise.

In the end, I complained that the front desk space is small, and most of it is reserved for the lobby. When there are many people, you can imagine how chaotic the front desk is, standing and waiting, and the environment is noisy; in addition, it may have something to do with Hyatt's wonderful system, I only saw it during CI The girl at the reception tapped the keyboard quickly, but it took a long time. No wonder there were so many people queuing up. The CO, including the refund of the deposit, was super fast. In addition, every time I take the elevator from the lobby on the 87th floor down to the ground floor, it is a kind of torture. It is strange that going upstairs feels okay.

After checking in, I wanted to take a bath, so I called the front desk to ask for a disposable bathtub cover, but they told me they didn't have one, and asked me to order takeout and buy one myself. Good guy, in a hotel that costs 3,000 yuan, I can do anything. Why should I come to your place when you are ready?
Later, the manager called again and said that he would send someone to re-disinfect. Later, a waiter came with a spray bottle and said it was disinfectant. He sprayed it twice and cleaned it before leaving. Is it as simple as disinfecting? I think Don‚Äôt others have common sense?
First of all, what you need when booking a hotel is peace of mind and comfort. I don‚Äôt recommend it here, and girls should pay more attention to hygiene issues. Please be careful when choosing this hotel. The hotel service is sorry for the price.

The main reason was that the room was extremely high, the large glass windows were poorly insulated, and the design was inherently flawed. Poor breakfast quality and poor service. This hotel has a false name, be careful!

msg:The free parking spaces at the entrance of the hotel are full, and you can only park on the 4th floor underground. It is a bit difficult to find a parking space. Then you have to go through a long corridor to the ground. The entrance to the hotel is relatively low-key, a small and hidden automatic door. Let's talk about the room, the room is very spacious, the toilet and shower room are separated on the two sides of the room. Because of the ordinary guest room, I can only see the Huangpu River just around Lujiazui. The hotel's breakfast room has a nice view, facing the Jinmao Tower. The breakfast is self-service and a la carte. The dishes are quite rich and delicious. It's just because there are a lot of customers during the Chinese New Year, and the food ordered has been waiting for a long time to be served. There are 3 restaurants on the top floor of the hotel. I tried the Cantonese restaurant. The taste is acceptable, the price is high, and there are few dishes. I do not recommend it.

In addition, there are so few sockets in the entire room that they can only be replaced by power *****s. Wake up, Park Hyatt! What else do you have but the landscape left!

Service is ok. Had a problem and changed the room as soon as possible. But back and forth. It is not worth going to Pudong to live. It is completely different from Park Hyatt four years ago. The rooms are very old. The toilet smelled of smoke. I really want to lend them my air freshener. Toilet facilities are outdated. When it fogged up in the morning, the window frames were covered with water. The bar on the top floor was also closed. All in all a bad experience. The only good thing is breakfast. Less variety. The service was good at all. Then the shading is very good. Final comments. Five-star hotels still need daily maintenance. No matter how good something is not protected, it will be very broken. Will not be coming again.

I originally booked for two nights, but I came a little early on the first day, so I put down my luggage and went to play. I was alive and waiting in the lobby until three o'clock! It's really not allowed to check in even one minute earlier. Nearly 4,000 nights in the "luxury" Bund view room, I was overwhelmed when I entered the door. A wide slanted column directly blocked the view of the window, so why not let me know in advance? When I ordered it, I didn‚Äôt say it blocked my view, and it didn‚Äôt appear in the pictures of Xiecheng. This "luxury" room only provides two free bottles of mineral water, and all drinks in the refrigerator are charged, the minimum is 60 a can of Coke, I went, the first time I saw a five-star hotel even charged for Coke. The key point is that the front desk service is a mess. I came to stay in the hotel, not to stay overnight. With the impatient look on my face, do you think we went too early? So deliberately gave us a room with pillars! This night almost didn't let me catch my breath, so I decided to retreat for a day, and quickly changed to the J Hotel opposite, even if the cost was twice as much as here, I would also like it.

Disadvantages: 1. The security guard downstairs has a low sense of service. He doesn't like to talk to customers when he sees them, and he doesn't take the initiative to help with luggage.
2. The hardware facilities in the room are old, the head of the bed is dirty, and there is a leftover apple at the door that has dried up, but no one found it, it was my child who saw it.
3. Worst WiFi I've ever stayed in a 5 star hotel, couldn't handle work.
Advantages: The staff is responsive to requests, and the WiFi problem has been responded to and given many solutions, although it has not been resolved. The restaurant staff are friendly and the service is good. There are not many varieties of breakfast, but the quality is good. It is also a first-tier big city and it is recommended to learn from Guangzhou Park Hyatt.

Even Shanghainese can‚Äôt resist such high-altitude beauty. Even if the weather is bad, it still feels like a dream, a unique surprise and shock Swept away the haze and hardship of December. Although the hotel has been around for some years, the design of the year still looks old luxury and modern. The provision of meals is slightly lacking, but under special circumstances, there may be a shortage of manpower, and it is quite grateful to continue to operate in difficult times.

msg:The whole hotel feels very arrogant when you stay here. When I first checked in, the service attitude at the front desk was very bad. Since I have booked a hotel for three nights, I asked if the room could be given a slightly later check-out. The front desk staff said that the delay can only be delayed until 12 o'clock at most... and then talked about the service attitude and hygiene issues in the room. The soap lather used the day before was not rinsed off, the bathrobes were not hung up to replenish the bathrobes, the paper towels were not replenished at all, and the heated dishes were served without any plastic wrap... As a star The hotel does not feel the details and service attitude it should have at all. It wasn't until the second night that I really couldn't stand it anymore. The manager on duty came up and his attitude was even more arrogant. He didn't solve the problem at all, but actually created it! Anyway, if there is no next time, I will never stay in this hotel again! In the end, the lobby manager Mandy called several times to solve the problem. I still hope that what we need to focus on is the details of the service attitude rather than the people in front of others...

If you don‚Äôt want to be blown directly to your head by the air-conditioned wind, you can try this one because their air-conditioning outlet is in the bed room and it will be blown directly to your head. My boyfriend was blown away. I had a migraine one night and the next day. I just wrapped my head in clothes and slept. When I asked the front desk, they said that all rooms cannot be changed like this. If you really have no choice but to stay in this hotel, it‚Äôs best to confirm with them where the air outlet is when making a reservation. And if you book another room and the front desk offers to upgrade you to a Pearl View room for free, be sure to refuse! ! ! When I was checking in that day, I heard someone calling the front desk to complain about this room. They didn't take it seriously. I thought I was lucky, but when I moved in, I went crazy. The environment was so bad. The bathtub was super dirty and old. I wanted to change to a regular room. They said it was overbooked. You cannot change back to the room you originally stayed in. I originally booked two nights, but ended up staying one night and left early. From the service to the environment, the difference is simply an epic disaster! Why

The hotel has a good view, but the facilities are old and a bit outdated. After all, it has been in the early ten years.
The building is cleaning the glass and starting work at 8:00 in the morning. Noise has always affected sleep. It is recommended to take the initiative to remind guests when checking in. Guests who are sensitive to noise should be arranged in rooms that are not affected. Such a high price should be for the sake of Guests take into account.

Because it was a birthday, I thoughtfully arranged the check-in ceremony, and there were rooms on the 81st floor. The scenery was really invincible... The environment of the whole hotel is clean and tidy Quiet...very comfortable...and the room is big...and the TV in the room supports screen projection. Having lived in Shangri-La before, the TV cannot be cast.

There are a few fly in the oin**ent: 1. The wifi in the guest room is basically not connected...because the floor is high, the mobile signal is not very good. So as mentioned before, TV projection is not actually available. 2. There are too few varieties of breakfast, which cannot match the positioning of a five-star luxury hotel. 3. The taste of the western restaurant is not good... I ordered a western restaurant for my birthday, ordered pasta, miso silver cod, and vegetable salad, the taste is very special. The kind that wouldn't want to try again...suggest improvements! Despite the invincible beauty, it is still very disappointing.

Recreational facilities: There is a swimming pool and a gym, which is very good. The little pot friends swam, and I also admired the Huangpu River for a run, perfect
Breakfast: A decent breakfast buffet with a full range of varieties. I like muffins and cream. It is good for children to have fruit bars. It is even better if they have hot milk.
Others: The hotel can order take-out, and it can be delivered to the reception desk of the bottom business, which is also very convenient. The nearby naked cakes and % coffee are great
Parking: easy to park, the accommodation can park for free, very good
The overall experience is very good, and the night view is also very beautiful. It's really good to enjoy the scenery in the clouds. If you want to experience the city night view, it is highly recommended.

I don‚Äôt know why it is designed this way. The three-meter table is really Is there any use? Then there is a big white wall next to it. The last time the hotel was a big white wall, the check-in experience should be an express hotel.
The lighting is also designed to make people uncomfortable, the toilet always feels dirty, and there is no way to order something later in the evening.
The overall feeling is that I spent more than 2k to stay in an express hotel. I can‚Äôt believe that this is also a Park Hyatt

In addition to the buffet breakfast for two, it also includes a steak dinner from Century 100, as well as a small refrigerator with soft drinks. After arriving at the store in the afternoon, we asked for a double bed, and the lady at the front desk upgraded us to the Bund view room on the 88th floor for free. What a pleasant surprise! The floor height of the room is super high, and there is a blue sky and white cloud horizon outside the window, which makes it feel very open all of a sudden. People are in the cloud, immersive. Dinner was served at the coffee bar in the lobby on the 87th floor. I reserved a window seat. The scenery is not to mention.

The service is generally quite good. Park Hyatt's service has always been a balance of enthusiasm and indifference, which will not make people feel overly enthusiastic, and appropriate indifference makes people feel more free. There is no problem with the quality of the breakfast, the variety is rich, the service is timely and the environment is elegant!

Facilities: The minimalist decoration will not be outdated until now. The original design is very forward-looking, but the hardware facilities (wifi speed, 4G and 5G network signals, indoor lights, telephones, TVs, showers, water temperature control, Shower room door, socket, switch, restaurant, gym, no sound system in the room) seems a little out of date, although it is not a big problem, it is really inconvenient for modern life, all hotel staff are also working hard to solve these problems Thank you very much, I believe that the hardware will solve it in the future.


Still, I really like Park Hyatt.

During the repair, the intelligent flushing system has already been on strike, and the dishes of the western restaurant have also lost a lot of expectations. It was originally written that the dinner included the Century 100 Steakhouse meal and was finally arranged in the lobby bar.

It's a big bed room, the bathroom with wet and dry separation is quite large, the toiletries are also good, the small refrigerator is free to eat (except wine), the steak in the evening set meal is about M4, and it tastes good when it is cooked and grilled for 7 minutes. The hotel's service is not bad, but I didn't see the snacks that should be in the package, and it's useless to ask, huh, huh. There is a warm water area in the swimming pool on the 85th floor, even if you can't swim in bubbles, you can take beautiful photos when you lie on the bed under the sunlight of the large glass window. Looking forward to staying again next time.

When I arrived on Friday afternoon and said there was no room, I went out to go shopping and asked the front desk to call me when there was a room. As a result, there was no phone call until nearly 17:00 in the afternoon. When I came back, I asked the room to be vacant. , then why not inform the guests? ? ? In addition, the set menu of the steak meal at Century 100 Restaurant was not actually eaten at Century 100 Restaurant, but at the check-in lobby bar. I thought Century 100 Restaurant was not open, but the breakfast was actually there the next day. . In addition, the hotel swimming pool is very small, and the overall light is relatively dim.

Check-in has three windows on the 87th floor and there are staff standing next to it, but there is no sense of service and the check-in queue is disorderly. Those who came later rushed to the front and checked in first, which increased the waiting time for those who came first. There was a male staff at the front desk who also had a bad tone. He had a sense of superiority like a big store. As a guest, it felt bad. The room was not big and the facilities were very old. There are still footprints on the bathroom floor that have not been wiped clean. As a landmark hotel in Shanghai, I originally had higher expectations. The facilities are getting older year by year and should be supplemented by improved service. I am very disappointed and will not come back again.

Talk about the dinner delivered by the package ü•£
Make an appoin**ent by phone before check-in and the front desk confirms it at check-in
As a result, I had dinner at 6 o'clock and told me to wait for a table? So what's the point of making an appoin**ent?
And proudly told me that the four tables reserved at 6 o'clock are all waiting!

Then I chose to eat in the room
Steak delivered! old and young! I don't even know how to do it!
Basically a big chunk wasted.

Talk about taking the plate, just take the plate, that's all
Breadcrumbs and tomato stalks on the table turn a blind eye
Just go!

Talk about the signal üì∂ wifi means no
You watch TV! He is stuck! The phone's own signal is much stronger than wifi...but it's also poor...

Last but not least, breakfast! This is the first time I've had a buffet breakfast in a five-star hotel with so few varieties!
Poor little! There's nothing to choose from
Just give me four small wontons in a bowl...
Hey‚Ä¶
318 for one person!

The steak set in the evening is also good, the French baguette, the mashed potatoes are especially delicious, and the pudding is too big to finish. To digest today's big meal, mother and daughter went to the gym and Dad went swimming to burn off the extra calories.
Breakfast is available to order, and omelettes are very much to my liking. Chinese and Western varieties are very complete. Also came across Spider-Man with a clean fa√ßade.
In short, three days and two nights, the pure hotel vacation is quite satisfactory.

This year, the lobby bar on the 87th floor was being renovated. I heard that it was reserved by a big brand for activities, so I checked in and sent a steak dinner, and I went there even more happily. I wanted to change to a twin room, and after making up the difference, the room gave us a big surprise (thanks to the beautiful lady at the front desk). The sirloin steak for dinner is quite satisfactory. I like the restaurant's bright oven. The grilled cod and beef tartar are also delicious. I feel that I can come back for this meal. The breakfast was plentiful, and at noon the next day, I wanted to order a Chinese restaurant (it is said that the Black Pearl) was not full. The restaurant recommends making reservations in advance.

3. Very stingy, there is a late check-out right in the package, but it only gives us a delay until 1:00 p.m.

Maybe it's just the facilities and location that are good. I lived in Regent last week, and I lived in W last week. I feel that Park Hyatt is not worthy of this price.

During the stay, the lobby on the 87th floor was reserved by lv. It seems that it will end on the 15th. The lobby is wrapped in black cloth and the light is very dark.
This time I booked the Park Hyatt Suite. Please note that the Park Hyatt Suite cannot see the Lujiazui River View. After arriving, I paid to upgrade to the Lujiazui View SuiteüôÑ. The room is about 130 square meters and has two bathrooms. The rain is very urgent and the water is very comfortable. There is no charging socket and USB at the head of the bed, which is very inconvenient for mobile phone parties. The mattress is not soft or hard, which is good. The lighting control in the room is very troublesome, because of the design style, the lights in the room are rather dim at night, and my mother is not suitable for it üòÇ
‚ÄãThe hotel's breakfast is on the 91st floor, semi-self-service. There are not many people dining on Thursday and Friday morning. The service of the waiter is acceptable and more timely. As the number of guests increased on Saturday morning, it was obvious that there were not enough waiters. Because the semi-self-service type needed to order food for the guests, the service obviously couldn't keep up, and it was a bit hectic. No one was free to ask you what to drink and what you needed to order after you were seated. For breakfast, the lack of a set of tableware was not made up in time, and it was made up after I ordered. As for the breakfast content, I thought the fixed menu would be adjusted individually every few days or there would be an AB menu (I think too much üòù), but after three days of eating, there was basically no change, it was all the same. 318 yuan for a breakfast is not worth it. If you want to eat out, there are quite a lot of snacks downstairs.
The swimming pool on the 85th floor is not bad, ‚Äãchildren go to play with water every day. A large pool is 1.2 meters deep, with a water temperature of about 27 degrees, and a small massage pool, 1 meter deep, with a water temperature of about 37 degrees, there are not many people swimming, and the experience is good.
‚ÄãIn short, landscape first, service second, and hardware third.

When checking in, the service staff said that I was given a free upgrade, with a river view, and I was staying on the 82nd floor. For me, a Shenzhen native who has seen the sea, I was given a river view, but in the end, I saw a small bay and no view. (On the other side of the Pearl Tower). Back to the facilities in the room, they are old and old. The only plus point is the toilet, which is full of dust. The room has no windows, which causes the smell to be rotten and old. The air conditioner temperature is turned up a bit, and it smells immediately. It is really disappointing.
2000 a night to stay here? It is much worse than the old Hyatt next door Jinmao. Fortunately, I only booked one night. I checked out without hesitation when I got up in the morning, which delayed me for half a day to change hotels.

Hygiene: I hung the room service sign "Please clean now" at the door for two hours, but no one came. This needs to be improved

I stayed in the Oriental Pearl View Room. I had a panoramic view of the Oriental Pearl, Jinmao and Huangpu River. Sitting in the room and looking at the scenery outside was really boring.
During dinner, when the restaurant manager learned that our visit was to celebrate the children's 4th birthday, he immediately sent birthday noodles, juice drinks and desserts to the children. Because he was worried that the noodle soup in the kitchen might be a little spicy, he also took care of the chef to make one. The noodle soup, such a thoughtful arrangement surprised us, and thank you very much!
The child said in the elevator back to the room, "Dad, I want to live here for three months." I think this is the voice of the children, but also our feelings!

üè® Check-in: Show the 72-hour nucleic acid code, and go to the lobby on the 87th floor for check-in. The check-in work is efficient and friendly throughout the whole process with a smile...
Advantage 1: The view outside the room is good! I stayed in the Oriental Pearl View Room, and the scenery I saw was really relaxing. Looking at the magic city from another angle, it is still the most fashionable and best Shanghai I love!
Advantage 2: It is convenient to go out. When you go out of the hotel, turn right to the overpass, which connects to the Lujiazui business district. Then the nucleic acid test under the overpass is also extremely convenient, and you can do it whenever you want! When you get on the overpass, you will be immersed in the beauty of the magic three-piece suit in 360 degrees, and then the Oriental Pearl will wave to you again, not bad! Looking at the beautiful scenery on the overpass, slowly come to the Zhengda Plaza, and go straight to the Huangpu River after going down the steps... Listen to the sound of the flute of the boat, the cheers of the seagulls, the waves lapping the embankment, and then look at the ancient architecture exposition group on the Bund on the opposite bank.

Although 10,000 points were given as compensation in the end, spending 2,001 nights to experience dirty sleeping is really very annoying and helpless.

Park Hyatt has always been my safe card, but this time I was really disappointed. Hope to improve next time.

From the ground parking lot to the elevator to the guest room, there are people who guide you with a smile on your face. The room service is also quite punctual and proactive. The meal delivery and cleaning are all in time at the appointed time, which makes people feel very comfortable.
Let's talk about the experience of the guest room. The hotel should be renovated once more than ten years after its opening. The overall design style is relatively calm and a**ospheric, and the bathroom is also in line with the proper configuration of this price hotel. Although Park Hyatt is not as high as the J hotel, due to the design of the building's curtain wall, Park Hyatt is quite good for enjoying the scenery.
Due to the epidemic, meals can only be served in guest rooms. The food is flawless and the quality of the food is relatively good, but the type and taste of the choice need to be improved. I hope to experience it again when the western restaurant is open. There are many kinds of snacks and soft drinks in the guest room, and there are also capsules. Coffee machine and a variety of alcohol, overall very satisfied.
Last but not least, before leaving, the hotel staff took the initiative to present a doll printed with the hotel brand and gave us a warm introduction. I think it is quite commendable that the staff have a sense of honor for the hotel they work for. Part of the corporate culture, praise!

Various emerging resorts with nothing, have always wondered where the well-trained hotel staff have gone, or whether the overall high-end hotel staffing standards have been lowered. Now it seems to be the problem of the hotel system.

The switches of lights and curtains are all in English and there is no obvious use sign. It is not friendly to customers like us who don‚Äôt live in hotels. If the switch of the equipment cannot be replaced, it is recommended to get a simple manual.
The sound insulation is average. On the day of check-in, I was fortunate to hear a pair of mandarin ducks next door singing at 9 o'clock. Fortunately, the family was going to the bathroom at that time, which avoided the embarrassment of staring at each other.

msg:As a five-star hotel with a big brand, I couldn‚Äôt help complaining about it. First of all, the layout of the room. When I walked in, there was a large open space in the middle of the room. With the lighting and white walls, it really made people feel that there was a part of the room. It feels rough, and it feels insecure to live alone. Secondly, there is no kettle in the room. It is said that the boiling water is integrated with the coffee machine, but the water is very slow. If you want to boil the kettle, you have to call it separately. If you like drinking tea like me It can be said that it is very inconvenient; the structure of the bathroom is inexplicably complicated, there is no instruction, it takes a long time to find the right button to adjust the water temperature, and the hot water is also very slow, I don't know if it is because the floor is too high; the wind of the hair dryer is cold Yes, the wind is also very small. After washing my hair in the morning and blowing it for a long time, I have a headache. The pillow is also very uncomfortable. I asked for a buckwheat pillow, but this is the first time I have seen such a thin and hard buckwheat pillow. I have stayed in various five-star hotels of big brands such as Intercontinental and Hilton in various parts of the country. This is really the worst experience. The fruit provided is terrible. It is a trivial matter not to send it. The above is for your reference. Bar.

msg:After staying at the Jinmao Grand Hyatt for one night, I came to the Park Hyatt across the road to continue the hotel tour after the year. During my two-day stay, I got to know Park Hyatt and the service provided by the hotel is impressive! Two days before check-in, a staff member called me to learn about my check-in requirements. I was pleasantly surprised by her patience. At the front desk on the 87th floor, the staff checked in carefully and took the initiative to think of the lack of a pair of slippers in the room and asked the service staff to deliver them to the room. Her kindness made me relax. On the night of check-in, I went out to have dinner with friends. When I returned to the room, I found that the cleaning staff had quietly cleaned the room again. The plates and knives and forks on the table were changed (for eating the birthday cake provided by the hotel), and the trash cans were all cleaned up. I poured it clean and replenished several bottles of mineral water. Her attentiveness made me warm. In addition to taking the initiative to help guests press the elevator, the staff in the elevator rooms on the 1st and 87th floors of the hotel also warmly greet the guests who come in and out. The buffet service staff on the 91st floor will take the initiative to smile and ask if they want to deliver food to your seat. The door of the hotel The doormen outside, no matter how cold or rainy it is, will take the initiative to carry your luggage and board the car for you, even if it is only a small suitcase, or even the cleaners and sterilizers you encounter in the elevator either take the initiative to help you press the elevator or I was moved by their efforts to hold down the door when it was open to let you walk slowly. Oh, the buffet breakfast recommends waffles and fancy bread, which are exquisite and delicious. Finally, a suggestion for friends who are interested in Park Hyatt Hotel: Park Hyatt Hotel often sells pre-sale packages on Ctrip from time to time (packages include free room upgrades, red wine, breakfast, birthday cake...), the opportunity is impossible. Lose it, if you like it, grab it immediately, and then wait for a sunny day like me, stay here for a day or two, and enjoy the unforgettable scenery here and the unforgettable service here!

Disadvantages: Whether it takes more than 10 seconds to answer calls from outside or inside, and even has to make several calls; there are always more than ten empty parking spaces at the entrance of the hotel during the stay, but there is no free parking for hotel guests; the desserts on the upper floor of HAPPY HOUR at sunset are really too much Sweet; the brewing pool opened after changing the water is really smelly; there are also handprints on the door of the guest room, phlegm stains on the wall of the guest bedroom, iron nails in the sauna room, wrong gender on the guest card, etc. It should not be the management level that Park Hyatt should have. The one who spit two spit on the wall of the hotel room, are you a person, how did you give birth to a CS like you, any hotel should put you on the blacklist!

The temperature is very friendly and comfortable for the children, but there are more people on vacation. What I want to complain about is that the room partitions are a bit unreasonable, and some places have up and down slopes. Children must be reminded to be careful of falling. In internal communication, the waiter in the breakfast area did not know that our room rate included breakfast, and repeatedly stated that they could not find it. The communication system of the five-star hotel was also quite speechless.

Thanks to my sister Marina at the front desk for upgrading the room. At the same time, when I asked to keep the room card as a collection, she directly gave me a suite card. I hope that the hotel industry will have more enthusiastic and professional staff like her.

Here are some very nasty comments: There is no place to charge the bedside; the bedside alarm clock rang when I was about to go to bed at about 11:30. This is very uncomfortable, and housekeeping did not check out the setting of this alarm clock. There are too many hangers on the luggage rack, it is easy to hit the hangers when putting luggage. Why not put most of the hangers in the closet. The curtains will leave seams, and there is not enough privacy.

Overall very good, but missing some details; will stay again

There will be cordial greetings throughout the whole process, which makes people feel at home. The front office manager Marina is very enthusiastic to upgrade me. The river view room facing the Oriental Pearl Tower has a good view. I like the design of separation of dry and wet. The sound insulation is also very good.

The breakfast will be replaced on the 79th floor to reach the 100th floor, which is a good source of diversification. The breakfast quality is exquisite, and you have the opportunity to experience it again.

Because it was a birthday, I asked Ctrip to communicate with the hotel to send a small cake, but I was a little disappointed that it was not upgraded, perhaps because of the large number of people staying on the weekend.

When the car enters the ground parking lot, a waiter will come to guide you to the designated parking space to park and open the door to help with luggage. The lobby of the hotel is on the 87th floor of the World Financial Center. As we confirmed by phone prior to check-in, related matters, including happy hour, hotel parking, check-in requirements during the pandemic, and reservations at Century 100 restaurants. So the whole check-in process felt very smooth and the service was quite attentive.
Because of the anniversary stay, the hotel also has intimate chocolate and champagne, thank you for the surprise. When I checked in, when I asked for the room card to be kept as a collection, the lady at the front desk of the hotel directly took four cards for my collection as a suite. The hotel's late check-out is also quite satisfactory, and can try to meet the requirements of the guests.
Happy hour is used in the hotel lobby at 17:00 pm, and the window seats are already full. . . So we quickly finished eating and left. . . The breakfast on the second day is served in the restaurant of Century 100 on the 91st floor, which is a semi-buffet. The type of breakfast is similar to that of hotels of the same level, and the taste is average~
The poor overall check-in experience is that the hotel's mobile phone signal is poor, and the quality of Wi-Fi needs to be improved.

Breakfast, from the coffee and tea I ordered at the seat, didn't come until it was almost finished. I urged twice in the middle. The experience this time was really bad.

In the early hours of the morning, I saw the exquisite meals on the menu and suddenly wanted to try the in-room dining at the Park Hyatt. However, I was told that this five-star hotel did not have room service after 10:30 pm, and the hotel did not provide this service in advance. Guests were notified of the new measures, only to be told "If you're hungry, just order takeout." They were surprised and thought twice about whether they were staying in a five-star hotel or a B&B in a fourth-tier city. Park Hyatt Shanghai, forever blacklisted, see you next time~

msg:Park Hyatt has always been one of my favorite hotel brands. This time, Park Hyatt Shanghai is located in the landmark World Financial Center in Shanghai. hun This is the first and most expensive Park Hyatt hotel in China. This stay experience, if it is an ordinary five-star hotel, then I can at least hit 4.8, but according to my rating standards for Park Hyatt, this stay experience is not satisfactory.

Let me talk about the advantages:
1. Park Hyatt Shanghai implements the features of Park Hyatt Hotel in quiet surroundings. The service at the front desk is very friendly, and some people help to press the elevator.
2. The room area is much larger than other hotels in Lujiazui, such as the Regent Grand Hyatt Shangri-La Ritz-Carlton.
3. Although the landscape is not as top-notch, it is also top-notch.
4. The toilet is separated from wet and dry like most Grand Hyatt Park Hyatt.

Let me talk about the deduction items:
1. The service attitude of the concierge on the first floor is extremely poor, and the tone of speech is commanding. Although strict management during the epidemic is a good thing, the attitude can be as friendly as the front desk.
2. Toiletries are not le labo used by Park Hyatt. The first time I met Park Hyatt whose toiletries were not le labo, it was quite dumbfounded.
3. There is a 5100 water bottle cap next to the bathtub. The waiter did not remove it when cleaning.
4. The design of the room is very unreasonable, the room is so big and the bed is so small, the table is very big, and the practical area is not high.
5. All lights and curtain switches are marked in English, and they are not easy to use. If I don‚Äôt know English and don‚Äôt know what the master is, I don‚Äôt even know how to turn off the lights at night.
6. The bath water is not very hot.
7. The air conditioner in the room was directly above the bed, which caused me to catch a cold. My throat is still dumb, coughing and runny nose all the time.
8. There is no turn-down service.
9. Because I want to have dinner with my friends at noon, I called the front desk to request to check out until two o'clock. The front desk said it could only be delayed until one point. I think if you don't delay, I will check out the luggage storage; otherwise, it will be delayed until two o'clock. What do you mean by extending it to a time that is not embarrassing or embarrassing?

All in all, this stay experience was mixed. However, for the hotel in Lujiazui, I still recommend the same hotel next to Grand Hyatt Jinmao, Pudong Regent, and even the farther JW Marriott Marquis. This Park Hyatt did not meet my expectations of Park Hyatt. I hope your hotel can change the location of the air conditioner, otherwise the guests will really catch a cold too easily.

msg:616/7 Shanghai Travel Notes
We made careful preparations for the special day and made reservations 1 month in advance. Just for this day, we traveled all the way to China's financial center "Lujiazui". It is indeed the magic city of the world, with tall buildings everywhere! The landmark building "Oriental Pearl Tower" in Shanghai is vivid in my mind. Jinmao Tower/World Financial Center/Shanghai Tower are three pillars, each one is higher than the other and reaches the sky. "Park Hyatt Shanghai" is located in it. After entering the hotel, the fast elevator can take guests to the hotel lobby on the 87th floor in more than 50 seconds. The ride is easy to cause tinnitus. At a glance, the top of the 88th floor Jinmao Tower outside the window is at eye level, and it feels like you can reach it with your hand. Unfortunately, the glass blocks everyone's desire to challenge. At this time, the beautiful lady at the front desk said that you should look more now, and you may not be able to see anything in a while. We were at a loss. Do we have to draw the curtains on the windows here? With a few questions in mind, I checked into the guest room on the 82nd floor. There used to be tall buildings outside the window, but now I can only look down. All I see are uneven low houses that don‚Äôt look very tall. Of course, there are a few so-called taller buildings interspersed here and there. As I was looking, a cloud or fog floated in front of me, which directly blocked my sight. The beautiful Huangpu River, the long and narrow roads, the tree-lined parks, and the densely packed high and low buildings, all of which woven together to create a beautiful view from above, suddenly disappeared. At this time, I could only look at the suspended room in a fog. The room had a very high floor height and all the doors were very tall. There was everything from a smart toilet to all the dimmer switches to coffee and tea sets and snacks and wine in the small refrigerator. After 20 hours of experience, I finally understood what the beautiful lady at the front desk said. I wanted to see the sunrise in the clouds when I came here. Now the room faces east as I wished, but man proposes, God disposes, and God doesn't favor me. My hope of watching the sunrise while lying on the bed in the clouds and fog has gone. However, another scene appeared. It felt like it was raining outside, falling in the clouds and fog, but I didn't know where the raindrops started to grow and float down. The most touching thing at this time was that if I could open the window, I could give away my dry dew to transform the world, but the window certainly couldn't be opened.
Finally, let's summarize! We are not gods, we can only feel passively in the clouds and fog. If there is no clock, I will stay in the clouds and fog forever. The clock at the head of the bed soberly told me to go back! Go to a down-to-earth place! There you can watch the sunset and sunrise of the starry sky quietly... Continue to pursue, pursue the beautiful and real starry sky dream-Park Hyatt Shanghai

Although the swimming pool is boundless, it is really small, incomparable to Kempinski. Not leaving Shanghai on weekends, Park Hyatt is also a good choice, provided that there is a discounted room voucher.

msg:Unbelievable!!! A very bad experience
Speaking of starting from the parking lot, I had just returned to Shanghai for a long distance and arrived at the hotel. No one directed me to wait at the door for a long time. Because the road was very wide, I drove into the right lane by myself (see Figure 1). Suddenly Two people rushed out and started asking me what I was doing. I said that I was parking the hotel staff and asked if I didn‚Äôt see this as a person leaving. After learning that I was a hotel guest, the murderous staff suddenly stopped talking and the other staff became abnormal. I was polite and went to check in. The front desk of the Bund View Room said that there was no room and asked me to upgrade the suite at my own expense. The first time I heard that the hotel had no room to upgrade the suite at my own expense, and there was a phone call before I came! Finally, I lowered the room type and gave breakfast as a gift
Later, my boyfriend came to me in the elevator on the 87th floor and waited for me to check in and went to eat supper together. He was probably seen by a male manager while waiting for the elevator. He thought he did not register on purpose and started the "police-style" building search first. The walkie-talkie asked the front desk how many people lived. After we got down to the first floor, the walkie-talkie in the concierge still heard something like "Who is this man and has how many people registered to stay?" My boyfriend was watched by the concierge. "Holding the walkie-talkie in my hand is especially exciting, like a police movie at 4 o'clock in the morning, I checked in normally, my boyfriend also went to the front desk to register his ID card, and then the climax came, and there was no sound of muttering decorations in the morning on the day of check-out. The list signifies that it‚Äôs not enough. Aunty knocks on the door when I am one o‚Äôclock. I said I don‚Äôt need to clean this. Everything is ok. At two o‚Äôclock, I have packed my things and I am ready to go. Aunty knocks on the door again and let us open the door. She is going to clean it. I encountered a five-star hotel that continuously forced people to check out. In short, I was very dissatisfied with the overall check-in. I hope the hotel seniors can take it seriously! !

msg:The room in Sky City is of five-star hotel standard. We were on the 82nd floor. The hardware and software facilities were very good, the service was thoughtful, and you could see both sides of the Huangpu River from the window. It was a cloudy day, but we would choose Park Hyatt Hotel next time. It is a hotel worth experiencing and recommended to everyone!

msg:The service is really average. After checking in in the afternoon, I suddenly heard someone knocking on the door. It turned out that the cleaning staff didn't know that the room was occupied and wanted to clean it. So my room, which looks just fine, has never been cleaned? Is this why I don‚Äôt have a comb? . . There were too many people in the lobby, so I told the manager to take the food to the room, but after waiting for forty minutes, it was not brought. I called the front desk to confirm when it would be picked up, and was told to confirm, but there was no call back, so I called again. The other front desk on the phone didn't know about this either, so they just said official things. When I insisted on giving me a specific time, I was speechless after it was delivered. There is also something wrong with the location of the sensor switch in the room. In the middle of the night, the child suddenly turned over and shook his hand... and then the lights were turned on. The decoration was also average. Apart from facing the Oriental Pearl Tower, there is no special advantage. The same applies to adding quilts, blankets and quilt covers. Can't such a luxurious hotel order more normal quilts? The blanket was really uncomfortable. They even knocked on the door at night to collect questionnaires and asked how was the turndown service? I didn‚Äôt come to stay at the hotel to give you questionnaires. Could you please use other forms for this kind of thing? I also curiously asked what the so-called turndown service was. It turned out to be closing the curtains and laying down quilts... There were very few breakfast items, and they refused to make hot waffles again. This is really too bad.

The room was also old and it felt like the whole room was dirty and shabby. The coconut for breakfast was so bad that I had diarrhea for a whole day. It tasted spicy, sour, and made me gassy. Sorry for the price of more than 2,000.

msg:This hotel charged tens of thousands of suite fees. When I came in, I thought there was a good view, but in fact, I didn't even have the money to clean the glass. Not only that, the lights in every corner of the room are very dim, and it is controlled by one button. If you want to turn on the desk lamp individually, you can never imagine! Thinking that my IQ was not enough, I invited their electrician. The electrician smiled and said, it is useless for you to change the light bulb under the control of the computer. If you live for a weekend, your myopia will be hundreds of degrees! I watched "Brainless and Unhappy" when I was a child, and I seriously doubt that this is the hotel they designed. I don't understand why the study desk should be placed in the bedroom? What is the purpose of the suite? The sunshades in the living room are useless, and it is impossible to lie on the sofa and close your eyes to rest, because people really lack the money to buy sunshades! at last! The network they provide is 2G. Whether you have a 5G, 4G mobile phone or even hotel Wi-Fi, he will always give you 2G network speed. You can send photos for 20 minutes, and your child‚Äôs phone and watch can‚Äôt get through. It feels like the pit was buried during the design, you are just an accident of theirs, rub your IQ on the floor, amen!

msg:This is my first bad review, but I am absolutely not telling any lies. It is really the worst hotel to stay in. It damages the image of Park Hyatt and the price/performance ratio is too low. The reasons are as follows 1. The network is extremely poor. The mobile phone used is Telecom. The front desk informed that there is a problem with the telecom signal in the entire building, so the data cannot be used. After the mobile phone is connected to the hotel network, it disconnects after leaving it for a while, so every time the mobile phone is used You have to manually connect to the hotel's internal network. 2. There were still hairs near the sink and bathtub that had not been cleaned up; 3. After leaving the hotel, I was told that soda water had been consumed. I contacted the hotel, but still no refund was given. If I drink, I drink. Do I need to lie for dozens of dollars? It seems that when you stay at the Park Hyatt in the future, the first thing you should do is to check whether the room items are damaged for the staff. Otherwise, you will have to let them talk nonsense and charge fees after leaving the hotel.

msg:The worst five-star hotel I have ever stayed in. This is the first time I have stayed at the Park Hyatt and it will also be the last time. This time I went to Shanghai and stayed in four hotels. Whether it was the W with the same price or the Narada with more than 600, they were all better than the Park Hyatt. Except for the tone of voice at the front desk, the service of other staff is too poor. The concierge is more like a manager. When entering and leaving, he only says to wear a mask and check the room card, without even basic polite words. I came in and out four or five times, and only when I left at the end did a concierge bring my luggage. Compared to the concierge who got on and off the car and opened the door, the concierge at the Park Hyatt was equivalent to none. As for breakfast, there are few varieties. The waiters in the restaurant all look like they have just woken up and are asking to help the baby get some water. They walk slowly. The most annoying thing is the chef who cooks the noodles. He is very aggressive and seems to not pay him for the meal. Same. Also, don‚Äôt consider this place if you are bringing a baby. There are no baby teething equipment or baby slippers here, and there is too little attention to the children. When you are at the W Hotel, as soon as you check in, they will see babies asking if they need a crib, blankets, bathrobes, dental equipment for the baby, etc., but the Park Hyatt does not have any of these. The last thing is hygiene. The bottle of the room shower gel is sticky, and there are traces of use flowing from the mouth of the bottle to the bottle. Will you not replace your toiletries? ? ? Also, the refund of the deposit is too slow. I checked out at 10 am yesterday. Not back yet. Other people's accounts are received on the same day. Convinced, give it a bad review. I originally wanted to tell the hotel, because every time I checked out of other hotels, I would ask how my stay was, but her family was so aloof that they didn't ask.

One is that there is a problem with the toilet. It will close automatically when it is on. How can this make people go to the toilet? The second is that there are stones in the egg fried rice I ordered. After calling and waiting for more than half an hour, the final solution was to return the plate of rice. The third is that there is a bang outside the window of the room after a while, and it is really impossible to sleep peacefully.

Shanghai Park Hyatt was originally the hotel I would definitely stay in when I came to Shanghai. This time I was too disappointed. This stay is the last time.

The waiter who cleaned the room did not take away the tableware that was delivered to the room the day before, and asked her to take it away. At noon, I specifically asked the waiter to change the bathrobe in the room, but it turned out that it was not there until 20 o'clock in the evening. The room was not changed, the room was cleaned without adding toiletries, and there was only a box of tissue paper in the bathroom. The service was simply terrible. It did not meet the standards of a five-star hotel in all aspects. The breakfast variety was pitiful and did not meet the standards of a five-star hotel at all. The standard of a star hotel. In short, I am so disappointed to choose this hotel with my children during the Dragon Boat Festival.

Since the next day was an early flight, there was no extra breakfast when the flight was extended.
Mandy also gave two breakfasts, the hotel is very user-friendly
Will still choose Park Hyatt Hotel next time
