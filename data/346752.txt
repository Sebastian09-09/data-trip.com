msg:Very beautiful and huge property. We had a villa with private hot spring which was an amazing experience for New Years Eve. 
Breakfast quite Chinese but very nice noodles.
The whole place is vast and partly looks a bit old, but clean enough and the room was clean. At the breakfast restaurant they had some renovations going on.
Service was a bit limited by lack of staff due to current covid outbreak but the staff on duty were working tirelessly to make up for the lack of people.

msg:The room is ok, not too trendy! To be honest, I came here just to soak in the hot springs, but I was disappointed. There were separate pools for men and women. After entering, the stench was terrible. They were all naked and sat in the pool while soaking and scrubbing. The hot spring was turned into a big bathhouse in Northeast China. There was a layer of dust floating in the pool water, full of mosquitoes. The child soaked for half an hour and was bitten all over the body. There was no disinfection at all! This is not a vacation, it's just suffering! A few hundred yuan, the price of a five-star hotel, but enjoying the service of a guesthouse! It's so disgusting, I will never come again, I am just a sucker! The experience is too bad!

msg:I stayed once and felt good. I was surprised to stay again! Although the facilities are old, basic hygiene should be guaranteed, right? Daily maintenance should be taken seriously, right? When I entered the room, I found big stains on the wall at the head of the bed; the seats were seriously worn; the surface of the writing board was sticky with oil stains; the surface of the kettle was thick with scale; the back of the bathroom shower was leaking, spraying from the front and the back together, and it was all over the body when it was turned on. The top was loose and shaky, and I was really worried that it would fall down while washing; the hair dryer was stained, and there was a layer of mold in the hair dryer; it is estimated that there are many rooms with these problems, and no one usually cares or checks. The service is not salty or bland except for the front desk guy who greeted the check-in enthusiastically. The hot spring service desk spoke rudely and simply, and the guests were more polite than the waiters, refreshing cognition. The only thing that remains unchanged is the hot spring. Other comments mentioned that the elderly took a bath and took a bath, but luckily I didn't encounter it. The bottom of the water looks very clear! I didn't experience the swimming pool, but it looks very clean, and the fallen leaves should be handled in time. The buffet breakfast can be described in two words: full. It is suitable for tour groups and meetings that stay overnight, and it is also suitable for the elderly to stay in hot springs. Others should be selected carefully!

And the most important thing is that the safety factor is not high. If a girl lives here, she is afraid that someone with ulterior motives will climb into the shower room from the back. The suite is booked. There is a stream behind it and it smells like a stinky ditch.
Mainly there are many mosquitoes

Hygiene: The hygiene feels simple. There is a thick layer of dust on the cloakroom cabinet. The smell in the room is too strong, there is a musty smell, damp smell, it may be because I live on the first floor.
Also, does the hotel make cold dishes for breakfast? It's cold when I go there early, and I can't eat it...
2 tickets to enter the park in Binlang Valley: Binlang Valley only gives you tickets to enter the park. If you want to play the project, you have to buy another ticket.

2. The service attitude of the restaurant waiters is poor. When we were queuing up for breakfast, there was a customer in front of us who had a child who needed to pay for breakfast. The customer said that he should let the child in first and let the waiter calculate the fee and pay together. The waiter refused and blocked the door and asked the guest to pay for the breakfast before letting him in. It says that breakfast is open until 10 o'clock, but there is nothing to eat at 9:20.

I don’t say much about the supporting facilities of the old hotel, but the rooms are everywhere. Visible mold, walls, ceiling... Obviously there are high floors that can be arranged during this time period, but the front desk staff doesn't understand why they have to arrange for lower floors... In such a damp and dilapidated room, do you still think that the guest experience does not need to be paid attention to? All in all, this room is the worst I've ever stayed in a hotel... and it's by the creek at night... I have to be careful about my light sleep, it's unbearable. The waiter started to serve. I can only say that it was very ordinary but routine. All in all, this suite is not worthy of the price of 600 yuan.

msg:Since New Year's Eve, the city of Sanya has been getting colder and cloudier, so I decided to go to Baoting to soak in the hot springs for a few days. Unexpectedly, a big problem occurred on the first day. The first big hole in 2013 came so early.
.
This time I booked a single-family hot spring villa. It was small in size, had outdated facilities, and was of poor hygiene. Let’s not talk about these. The pool in the yard was not comfortable, but it was OK.
.
The next day, I got up early as usual, had breakfast and went back to my room to soak for a while. I had to call the hotel to let the water out of the pool.
	
①. Looking at the call record, I made a call at 8.12 to ask for the water to be drained and to wait for the water to drain and clean the pool.
.
②. I started draining the water after 9 o'clock, but found that the water could not be stored, so I called at 9.11 to ask to turn off the water. After all, I don't like waste.
.
③. Look at Picture 2. This pool is quite big. I took the photo at 9.45. At this time, the water was about half full. I felt that it didn’t look good when taking pictures, so I continued to put it in.
.
④. Look at picture 3. At 10.13 minutes, it was full. I took a few photos and then turned off the faucet and prepared to take a bath.
	
⑤. At about 10.40, I heard the cleaning lady talking outside the wall. Her voice was very loud and her accent was a bit dialecty. I couldn’t hear it clearly, but I could tell that she mentioned my room number and said that I was wasting hot spring water. , kept turning on the water, etc. His words were full of dissatisfaction with me.
.
⑥. The climax came. Two or three minutes later, the cleaning lady came directly and smashed the door of my villa. Note that it was "smashed". Not only did it make a banging sound, but she also cursed loudly. I was a little confused at the time, and I was really shocked. This was the first time I encountered this kind of situation when I stayed at Qianjia Hotel. If I were in a beautiful country, I would have called the police immediately.
.
I went to open the door tremblingly, but my aunt didn't give me a chance to speak at all. She pointed at me and yelled, probably to the effect of "Why are you wasting water so much?" Do you know how much a ton of hot spring water costs? He cursed and left.
.
I was shaking with anger and immediately called the hotel front desk, who told me that they wanted to find out more about the situation. Then, before she left, this auntie was outside the wall, probably arguing loudly with the front desk through the intercom.
.
⑦. I called the front desk again at 10.56. I said that I felt insulted and asked them to figure out what to do. I didn’t waste hot spring water. Why should I be insulted and slandered by a hotel cleaning staff? Let them check the water meter and refill the water according to the timeline to see if I have wasted anything!
.
Taking a step back, even if I wasted water and left it on for half an hour, I still own a hot spring villa. The settlement price of a ton of hot spring water is less than 2 yuan, and this faucet does not even have half a ton of flow in half an hour! The price of a villa for one night is over 1,000. Will I be insulted if I use more water? Being taught by hotel staff like a child? Are the employees not trained? Or is this how hotels treat guests! ?
.
As a result, I called to check out at 11.56. For more than an hour, the hotel did not provide any follow-up feedback to me. When I checked out, I asked the front desk about this, and the answer was that I didn't know.
.
The manager on duty that day, whose surname was Li, was also the only employee I met with good service in this hotel. He first listened to my complaint and reported it to the hotel superiors. Later, he saw me waiting in the lobby and offered to bring water. Later, because he couldn't call a taxi, I went to another hotel one kilometer away, and he took the initiative to drive me there in a battery car.
.
While waiting for the bus, the general manager of the hotel led the cleaning lady involved to come over and apologize. But to be honest, I didn’t feel the sincerity of the manager and the lady. It felt like it was just a formality. They repeatedly emphasized that they did not insult me, okay. , how would you feel if you were taking a bath in your villa and heard someone calling you by name? You must know that the villas here are stepped on the hillside. From the road below to the door of my villa, you have to climb dozens of steps. You can hear it all, which shows how loud it is!
.
Not to mention that he came directly to knock on my door later. It was not a friendly communication at all, and it was even more presumptuous to have an attitude that should be expected in the service industry. Please read carefully what the so-called general manager said: "Auntie is also serious and responsible. She treats the hotel where she works as her home. She thought someone was wasting hot spring water, so she was a little too anxious. In addition, she usually speaks loudly."
.
The cleaning lady stiffened her neck and said sorry, and then continued to defend herself during the communication between me and the general manager. In this matter, the hotel did not express any other words except a verbal apology. Oh, he is really a "good employee" who protects the interests of hotel property, so he must protect it well, right? Then the two of them walked away side by side, and I just wanted to leave the hotel quickly.
.
Let’s get back to business, let’s talk about this hotel. This is a hotel that opened very early. It is divided into the main building and the villa area. The main building is currently under renovation, and only a few basic rooms and villas without swimming pools can be booked.

This public area is quite large, and its biggest feature is probably the celestial bathing pool with separate bathing facilities for men and women. Since I don’t like public bathing, I didn’t go in to take a look.

There is a special-shaped swimming pool next to the hot spring area, a round hot spring pool in the middle of the swimming pool, and a square swimming pool not far away. These are probably the facilities.
.
The villa area is built on the mountain and is divided into several levels. The view is not bad. At least from my yard, I can see the Qixian Mountains shaded by bamboo leaves. However, it is said to be a single-family villa, but it is actually a townhouse. The villa next to it was only separated by a wall, so I didn't dare to speak loudly while taking a bath.
.
The nominal size of the villa is 110 square meters, which should include the area of ​​the courtyard and the swimming pool. The interior is actually one bedroom and one bathroom. The space is very cramped, only 40 square meters at most. Not only does it not have a desk, it doesn't even have a small table for eating. without.
.
The phone was broken, all the lights were broken, and the original mosquito coils were lit in the room, which was so incense that no one could get in at first. The minibar comes with two small bottles of Nongfu Spring. If you ask for more, you will be charged, 5 yuan per bottle, and I don’t want to. What can I say? Those who often soak in hot springs should know how much water is consumed. Isn’t this a disguised form of forcing people to buy high-priced water? Fortunately, I had the foresight to place an order for two boxes of sparkling water on JD.com before arriving at the hotel. I drank 16 bottles in one day. The other ones are Lipton tea bags and instant coffee.
.
The facilities in the house can be said to be quite old, and the sanitary conditions are also worrying. The toilet smells bad, and the shower room can only barely wash you down, and there is no sense of body.
.
The yard is not big either. Although it doesn’t look like the official picture and it’s not the round pool I like, the pool is not small, but it’s just not very good at cleaning. I spent a lot of time cleaning it myself.
.
Originally it was okay if it was a bit shabby, the service was good and comfortable, but I didn’t expect it to be bad at this end. Anyway, avoid this one when coming to Baoting!

msg:On the whole, it is still possible, but the problem is also obvious. For this price, first of all, the room facilities are a bit old, and secondly, the Tangquan Garden is smaller than the picture, and the facilities are different. The reservation must be confirmed with the hotel to ensure that the picture corresponds to the real thing. I'm just drawn to pictures. Secondly, the hot spring is not the same as I understand, the temperature is slightly lower, you need to put the water on for about 30 minutes, otherwise it will be cold water. In the end, it was amazing that someone who seemed to be another resident swiped the yard door with a room card and almost entered my room when I was half asleep. Scared to death, but luckily stopped in the end. In short, it's okay as a resort hotel, but the price/performance ratio is really hard to say.

There were also cockroaches dying on the stairs, and the hot spring faucet was broken. , Water came out from the cracks in the side stones, the cold water couldn't be turned off, and it was repaired the next day.

The small hot spring pool on the balcony is narrow, small, deep and ugly. It is obviously not taken seriously. The price is expensive. The view outside the balcony is messy.

Secondly, poor sanitation, stubborn water stains on the bathroom glass, stains on the floor and walls. Finally, the breakfast tastes average, nothing to eat, the tableware is plastic, the knives, forks and spoons are metal but they all feel greasy; the milk is terrible, like milk powder and water. In addition, the swimming pool water is not clean, there is no cycle cleaning, the hot spring water is very good, it is super hot and there is no water.

🍃Environment: This time, I stayed in the parent-child hot spring villa at the foot of Qixianling Mountain. The environment is beautiful and quiet. The private pool experience is also very good. I didn't go to the public pool. Xianling
🔔Service: The overall service is ok but I was not prepared and was bitten by poisonous mosquitoes. I went to the front desk to ask for mosquito coils. I couldn't provide matches or lighters. Click on the four corners of the open-air bubble pool to finally relieve mosquito troubles
When I left the store, I accidentally left my bag. Later, I called the hotel to help me find it and sent it back to me. Thank you very much.
🧰Facilities The hotel has been open for a long time. In addition to the humidity in Hainan, most hotels in Hainan have outdated equipment. This room is very noisy. There is no way to call the maintenance personnel to check. You can only turn on the wind a little bit.

It is not low but the product is very poor; the so-called hot spring is by no means really natural, the experience is just ordinary hot water, and there is no mineral smell or texture at all. In short, a relatively unsuccessful experience, five-star price, and the feeling of a fast hotel.

When I arrived at the hotel, the little brother at the front desk was kind enough to upgrade me to a mountain view room, the one with a balcony and a hot spring pool, and you can see Qixianling from the balcony. My favorite is their swimming pool. The pool is very clean and suitable for those who like to swim. In addition, there is a hot spring pool in the center of the swimming pool. When you are tired from swimming, you can directly come up to soak in the soup. It can't be more comfortable.
    In addition, his outdoor hot spring pool is divided into different areas for men and women. You can soak in celestial hot springs as you like, completely release yourself, and completely relax your body and mind. It is highly recommended. come back next time. . .

The room was indeed old, but what surprised me was that the hot springs outside were separated by men and women. The water is also very clean. I met some older people who talked to me inside and said that this is the best male and female pool they have ever soaked. After spending 120 yuan for lunch, I ate breakfast the next day and left. I regret not staying for a while, so that I left unforgettable memories here, and I miss it very much after I left.

The vegetation is better. The courtyard is larger. In terms of hardware facilities, the facilities and items in the room are a bit old and have not been maintained for a long time. The room booked from Ctrip is free of deposit, but when you check in, you must charge 500 yuan as a deposit or you will not check in. He said that Ctrip can’t control them. There are few people, and there are not many varieties of breakfast. It is very different from the previous rich breakfast. There are few guests, but the standard of service cannot be lowered. Breakfast is already a fast hotel standard. The reception at the front desk was poor. During the epidemic, the double code and body temperature were not checked in accordance with the prevention and control requirements. This is not responsible for the hotel itself and its guests. The deposit should also be issued with a hotel-specific receipt. It will be refunded when the guest leaves the store, and cannot be returned the same way after the guest leaves the store. I can't imagine this is a five-star hotel, I won't stay next time.

床很軟很舒服。
説一下不足：
泳池邊的躺椅缺少了當年的軟墊。
別墅房間外牆因為潮濕有黴菌，熱帶雨林氣候可以理解，但真的太影響美觀和感受了，建議外牆能重新粉刷一下，玻璃也完全可以再擦的乾淨一些。
早餐沒有十年前好了，趕上百人的旅行團，錯峯去吃飯告知餛飩沒有了，麪是素麪，一點肉都沒有。水果衹有兩種。

表揚一下接我們退房的小哥哥，非常積極主動的幫我們提行李，並幫忙把行李放到車子上。可以感受到是在用心服務。

msg:十一假期入住荔苑酒店，酒店在七仙嶺裏面性價比很高，七仙嶺作為保亭著名景區，交通便利，荔苑酒店處於七仙嶺核心區域，風景和環境很好。
入住的是詠竹園景房，在大堂辦理入住後酒店有電瓶車負責送至客房，客房不大，陽台就是竹林景觀，很賞心悦目，但設施略顯老舊而且充電插口少且設計不太合理，手機充電不方便。
酒店温泉池很不錯，一種是户外公共温泉池，一種是日式温泉池（男女分開），都是免費使用，去的當天下着小雨泡着温泉看着雨林景觀，相當舒服！
酒店池畔98元一位的燒烤自助火鍋還算實惠，不想出去吃飯可以嘗試。早餐在主樓中餐廳，種類提供不算特別豐富，但味道尚可。
閑時在酒店散步，感覺荔苑酒店別墅房的入住體驗應該會更好。最後發現主樓的有露天咖啡吧和露天温泉池，但好像關閉了沒開有點可惜，上邊風景很好可以直接看到七仙嶺主峯，拍了張照片就離開了，希望今後能重新開放。
