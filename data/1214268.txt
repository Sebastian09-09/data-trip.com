They not only arranged for us to stay on a non-smoking floor, but he also upgraded one of our rooms to a river view, improving our journey with beautiful surroundings. Given that we were traveling with elderly family members, Han and Emily went above to locate both rooms on the same floor, making our movements much easier!

They also helped me book a restaurant and all spoke very good English. The hotel was clean and quiet. Rooms were well appointed. I would certainly stay there again and will look to use this brand again.

msg:Had the most wonderful stay at a hotel at Pan Pacific Tianjin in recent years, largely thanks to the warm hospitality of all front desk staff who were warm, welcoming and very helpful. 

I had a headache and as a foreigner, could not order painkillers via delivery and Leila from the front desk was really nice to help me out with it. Upon check out, the front desk staff were also all friendly and sweet (I forgot her name). I accidentally left my outerwear behind and the concierge was really helpful to help me retrieve and send it to my friend's hotel for me. It was a solo trip and witnessing such warmth and kindness overseas really made my trip memorable and I would like to thank all the staff! :)

Location is perfect, just across the street from the river, and about a 10-15 minute walk from Tianjin Eye. Room is spacious and clean too. Only small room for improvement is if the ventilation can be better as there was a bit of smoke smell for a non-smoking room. But overall, Pan Pac Tianjin is a hotel I'll return to stay if I ever visit Tianjin again.

The pool was also not bad but not deep enough (1,2 m everywhere). They also had sauna but it somehow did want to warm up properly (65 degrees is not enough for a real sauna; shall be around 85-90). In overall, a nice stay.

It is only 400 meters away from the hotel. The Southeast Asian style restaurant on the first floor of the hotel is also good. Dinner and breakfast are eaten in this restaurant. The variety is relatively rich, and the service attitude is very good. There is also the famous Yanchunlou in Tianjin behind the hotel, which specializes in Tianjin specialties. It is very awesome.

The Pan Pacific Hotel is very close to the Tianjin Eye and the Ancient Culture Street, next to the Haihe River. Although the Tianjin Eye can hardly be seen from other rooms except the suite, the view of the Haihe River is acceptable. The hotel provides 4 bottles of mineral water and 4 bottles of drinks every day. Breakfast is until 10 o'clock, and the variety is quite complete, which is suitable for travel time. Stayed for 2 nights, and caught up with the Dragon Boat Festival and sent a small box of rice dumplings, warm! Tianjin is a very pleasant city, I will come again!

This time, he lived in the Pan Pacific Hotel to meet his child's wish. The child's choice is very correct. The hotel is in a very good location. It is next to the Haihe River and it takes about 10 minutes to walk to the Tianjin Eye. The front desk and concierge service staff of the hotel are very enthusiastic. When we arrived at the hotel, because the room was not cleaned yet, the hotel gave two drink coupons and upgraded the room type. When we went out to eat, the child left her schoolbag in the hotel dining bar. She called the front desk of the hotel to let us rest assured that she would go to find it immediately. We could hear that she ran to find it on the phone. In less than 30 seconds, she told us that she had found a backpack and confirmed the size and color of the backpack with us. After confirming that it was correct, she told us that she would keep it at the front desk. Thank you very much for this service staff! The sanitation of the hotel room is very clean, and it is not perfunctory because of the high occupancy rate. The upgraded room type can see the beautiful night view of the Haihe River! When checking out, the handsome guy Xiao Han at the front desk was warm and thoughtful. He asked about the stay experience, hoped that the hotel would have any improvements, etc., and gave some Tianjin specialty snacks. Every employee of Pan Pacific Hotel takes their work very seriously and serves guests attentively. I will choose here again when I come to Tianjin next time!

The overall experience during the stay was also very good. The restaurant staff was friendly and the meals were collected promptly and neatly.
The hotel is in a good location, and it is right by the river. It is really comfortable to take a walk at night in this season.
The room is spacious. Although it is not so new, the bedding is OK. I slept very well for three nights. This is very important for business travelers. Bottled water and soft drinks in the room are very sufficient, which is good. The design of the curtains is not very friendly. The roller blinds cause the outer curtains to always be outside the track...
There are not many types of breakfast, and there are fewer Western ones, but I think it is enough overall. After all, people only have one stomach.
Overall, it is still highly recommended. Some new hotels may have good facilities, but the uneven service level is particularly annoying. The old hotels are indeed worthy of respect and recognition in terms of soft power. I will consider staying here again when I come to Tianjin next time.

msg:I booked a suite. I moved here from the Ocean Polar Hotel to be closer to the Tianjin Eye. I was hesitating between the Banyan Tree Hotel and the Pan Pacific Hotel before. Practice has proved that I made the right choice of the Pan Pacific. It is closer to the Tianjin Eye and has a large room. For us two adults and two children, the suite is worth it. We can see the Tianjin Eye directly from the window. The children are also very happy. The key is that I moved here from a parent-child hotel. As soon as I entered the door, I felt the hotel's service. This is the real hotel service. The staff are super kind and friendly. The service in the executive lounge is also super good. Thanks to Xiaomi, Jane and other unnamed staff, you are all super good. The hotel is also very close to the Ancient Culture Street and the cruise ship terminal, just a few minutes' walk away, so the environment and service are great. I will book here next time.

msg:It was booked temporarily, and the parent-child room was fully booked, so the child's father stayed on the chaise longue for one night. When no extra quilt was requested, the room service staff added a quilt and children's toiletries the next day, which was very considerate and thoughtful service.
May Day special souvenirs: different snacks were received every day
There were a lot of drinks in the refrigerator, and there was no odor or water stains when the washing machine was turned on. The environment was very clean.
Very satisfied, I would definitely recommend it to friends traveling.

The window, which is not big to begin with, is broken into pieces, and the river view is like nothing. The quality and price are seriously inconsistent. It costs more than 1,500 and does not include breakfast. Please be careful.

There was a small accident during the extension of stay on the 4th. The on-duty manager Jia and another manager (I forgot his last name 😅) communicated in time and solved it perfectly.

msg:Because the experience was good, I stayed for another night. The welcome soft drinks were still given, but the room did not come with breakfast. However, there are many snacks in Tianjin, so you don’t have to eat them in the hotel. You can go to the northwest corner to queue up for breakfast. 😀, Tianjin Eye is super popular at night, and you need to queue for a long time. We chose to take a sightseeing bus at night. During the day, Tianjin Eye and the cruise ship did not buy tickets. It is super popular during the day and night, and you need to book tickets one day in advance. The pier is right next to the hotel, and the hotel has convenient transportation. It is not far from anywhere. Because we are with two children, we take taxis everywhere, and it will not cost more than ten yuan to get to various attractions. The farthest is the museum, which costs more than 20 yuan by taxi. It’s a pity that we didn’t go to Binhai District, which seems a bit far. Next time I come to Tianjin, I will go directly to Binhai New District

It was also a surprise that the price included a simple meal on the executive floor! But it is worth mentioning that Tianjin is not like Beijing. Dinner ends early, so you have to eat early! The service is also impeccable. It is also very convenient to go out and play. The Ancient Culture Street is across the road. I really recommend it👍

Room facilities: clean and tidy, and the washroom is separated.
Location and transportation: It is convenient to go anywhere, and you can take a taxi if you want to go a little further. There are many attractions nearby. Don't worry about eating.

msg:The first time I stayed at Pan Pacific was last year when Jay Chou was at the concert. This is my third time staying here. I stayed for two days in a row. I stayed at the executive floor including the executive lounge. The hotel is in a good location, not far from the Tianjin Eye, the pier, the Lion Grove Bridge, and the Ancient Culture Street. The a**osphere is good for strolling along the Haihe River at night. My child likes Pan Pacific because there is a fountain at the entrance of the hotel, a swimming pool for swimming, and water play in the bathtub in the room. The room has a direct view of the night view of the Haihe River. When strolling along the Haihe River at night, you can always get something good when playing with rings, haha!
Praise:
The guy named Cao from the concierge depar**ent is warm and polite, and the introduction is very good
Jane from the executive lounge is patient and caring for children, and the service is very good
The guy who makes the staple food in the breakfast room, I asked for egg rolls, and he also satisfied me, it was delicious
There are also other staff members I met, the service awareness is very high, in line with the style of the hotel

The hotel has a good environment and location. It is very close to the Ancient Culture Street and 15 minutes away from Tianjin Eye. It is next to the Haihe River. It is very pleasant to take a short walk in the evening. The room is very large. Manager Du upgraded the river view. The room is clean. If you need it, call and it will be delivered immediately. I am very satisfied every time I stay. I will definitely come to Pan Pacific again. I recommend staying here!

msg:Thank you to Xiao Xue at the front desk. We upgraded to a large family room at first, but upon request we arranged a high-floor Haihe River view room. Check-in was relatively smooth and check-out was quick.
The overall environment of the hotel is good. It takes about 10 minutes by taxi from Tianjin West Railway Station and 5 minutes' walk to Ancient Culture Street.
Breakfast is average, the restaurant is large and there are many people.

The bedding is okay and quite comfortable. The water pressure in the shower is also good and the hot water is stable.
Pillows and towels are relatively clean.

Suggestion: Regarding the placement of hand sanitizer and moisturizing lotion in the bathroom, it would be better if the hand sanitizer can be placed on the side closer to the sink. When you wash your hands and squeeze out hand sanitizer, water won't get everywhere.

msg:Facilities: Really very poor. The curtains of the 760 yuan room leaked a lot of light in the morning... and the sound insulation was very poor. At night, I could hear people talking by the door clearly, and I could also hear the lights in the next room being turned on and off.
The refrigerator resonated with the wall, and the whole room was buzzing. I unplugged the refrigerator before going to bed to stop the noise.
The toilet was not smart, but there was an 80% chance that the flush button would not rebound after being pressed. Water was always flowing, and I had to press it again manually.
The toilet door was very heavy, and it would bang even if it was closed gently. If someone lived with me, going to the toilet would greatly affect my sleep.
When I was washing, the light on the sink actually fell off... I tied it up with a drawstring bag, and it was one high and one low. There were also other damaged tables and bedside tables that were not wiped clean...

Hygiene: There were a lot of small advertisements at the entrance of the hotel when I got off the bus, which was really cheap and embarrassing.

Service: It was pretty good, check in/out was relatively fast...

msg:Because I came to Tianjin for the first time to see Jonathan Lee's concert, I got off the plane and got in a taxi at the airport (it is recommended to make an appoin**ent online). The female driver seemed impatient. She neither drove away nor turned on the air conditioner. She drove all the way. After about 5 minutes, she said that the meter was not on... She even quoted a random price when we got to the hotel... I was so angry that I told her about this when I checked in. The front desk receptionist immediately said politely, "I'm sorry, you left a bad impression on Tianjin as soon as you got off the plane... It's not your fault, we are embarrassed... The room was clean and tidy, and water was immediately provided when I asked for it. The location is also good, there are many attractions around, and it is very convenient to walk.

Except for the check-in time, the front desk was a little slow due to insufficient staff and I had to wait for a while.
Others are pretty good. The room cleaning is very good and they will help to sort out clothes and so on.
The service provided at this price is very good.
The price-performance ratio is quite high.
The most important thing is that it is very close to Tianjin Eye, Lion Grove Bridge, Italy and so on.
It is close to everything and avoids the congestion of taking taxis. You can go anywhere by bike. It is a few steps to the river and the cruise port.
I will stay in this hotel again next time I come to Tianjin.

This time, the young lady also upgraded the room to the 28th floor with a river view, which is even more beautiful. Enjoy the hotel's rich buffet breakfast and have a great lunch and dinner. The cleaning aunt in Handan on the 28th floor is really good, and the room is very clean. At that time, there was no air conditioning in the room, and the quilt was added twice, and the electric heater could be added. A trip, a wonderful experience. In particular, I visited the "Kiev Aircraft Carrier", submarines, 133 destroyers, and flying car stunts, which are free as long as there is a veteran certificate. Like Tianjin!

msg:On a whim, I took a quick trip. It was already past 20 o'clock when I arrived in Tianjin. I planned to find a hotel close to the high-speed rail station to rest for one night~ (It only takes 10 minutes to take a taxi from the high-speed rail station to the hotel, which is very close. ~)
advantage:
(1) The little fairy at the front desk is gentle and patient. She knows that everyone likes high-rise buildings, so she directly helped me open the 26th floor. However, I took an old man on a trip with me. The old man had a bad heart and didn't like living in high-rise buildings, so she helped me change to the lowest 10 floor. Layer😂～
(2) The hotel is in an excellent location, surrounded by attractions and restaurants, making it very convenient to go anywhere.
(3) The price is affordable. A deluxe city view room without breakfast only costs more than 500. The price of a five-star hotel is really cheap 😂.
(4) The room service is also very good. At around 10 o'clock, the cleaning staff asked if cleaning was needed. They learned that we would have to rest for a while and told us to press clean when cleaning was needed🔘. The supervisor may have come to inspect just now and asked us if we needed anything (I was too lazy to move today, so I extended my stay~)
shortcoming:
(1) The hotel is a bit old, 10 years old, and the room is not very smart 😂
(2) It’s been a bit cold these two days. I turned on the air conditioner last night, but even if I turned it on to 30 degrees, it could only rise to 21.5 degrees. It’s so cold 😂. In the morning, I asked the handsome guy at the front desk. He said that the hotel and residential buildings had stopped heating, so the temperature couldn't go up😭.
(3) Breakfast is not expensive, 80 per person, so there are very few varieties, and the taste is just so-so. It is more convenient than anything else.

The twin room is equipped with a chaise couch as wide as a small bed, which is very suitable for a family of three. There was no water when I washed up the next morning. I rinsed my mouth with mineral water and called to complain, which was quickly resolved! Advance inspection and maintenance of facilities and equipment should not occur in a hotel of this level. The service was mediocre, without the friendliness and comfort of a high-star hotel. There was a big gap between the hotel and the Banyan Tree opposite where I stayed the next day! Hope it can improve. The hotel's ground parking lot is very crowded and disorderly, and the first impression upon entering is not particularly good. If there are no special requirements, overall it is a good value for money hotel.

The service was so attentive to Xiao Li and Xiao Wang. It gave us the feeling of going home. Thank you for giving us such a good experience. We will come again next time!

Service: I originally booked a riverside double bed room, but the front desk saw that I was directly upgraded to a parent-child room with my baby~Thank you to the lady at the front desk.
In addition, the hotel front desk provides disposable bathtub covers, which is very considerate.

Environment: The environment is good. The downstairs is behind Yanchun Building, which is very convenient~ But remember to queue up in advance, there are really many people
It is a 10-minute walk from Tianjin Eye and a 25-minute walk from Italian Style Street. Recommended

Special thanks to the beautiful manager Du at the front desk for our stay this time. She specially upgraded the room type when we brought our children. Not only can we see the beautiful view of the Haihe River, but we can also see the Eye of Tianjin. It’s great👍The room is big and very clean. There are two beds and a couch, so older children can sleep more comfortably with their parents. There are also drinks in the refrigerator. It is definitely a very cost-effective hotel!

msg:I am an old Ctrip user. No matter where I go, I will immediately open Ctrip and start booking. First of all, the hotel room is very big, with a bathtub, and you can see the Haihe Lion Forest Bridge outside the window. I booked this hotel because it is more convenient to go everywhere and the location is very good. Ctrip The points redeemed were worth 120 for breakfast. The breakfast was mediocre and not very rich by five-star hotel standards. The service staff were very enthusiastic and delivered things very quickly after calling twice. The interior decoration of the room was a bit old, but at first glance, it was carefully thought out. Maintenance, the current five-star hotel standard requires the whole house to be smart, but this hotel does not have it yet. This is an area that needs improvement. There is still a serious problem, that is, the air conditioner is turned on to 30°C, which is also natural wind and does not heat. At night I was still a little cold after taking a shower. I was afraid of catching a cold. It was okay to cover myself with a quilt at night (I didn’t go to the front desk for fear of trouble). The overall feeling was very good. I will still book this hotel when I go to Tianjin in the future. I recommend it to everyone.

msg:The plan was to take the elderly and children to Tianjin on the weekend, so I went there at noon on Saturday. The man who helped me check in was a man who really left a very, very good impression on me. They were super welcoming and gave us a very close room, which provided us with a lot of convenience. Thank you very much. It's a pity that I forgot to ask my last name. It's a pity that he is the tall man helping in the lobby around 11 noon on Saturday. The man who helped transport the luggage seemed to be very enthusiastic. At that time, the children were going to play in the children's paradise. He took the initiative to take the luggage and send my two elders upstairs. Thank you.

The hotel is in a good location. Although it is a bit old, you can feel the patience and meticulousness of the hotel staff. The guest room phone is always easy to get through, and all requests are always met. Although the swimming pool is not big, the staff are also very responsible and proactively remind the children to test the water temperature before letting the children go into the water. There was also a female staff member in black clothes in the cafeteria on the first floor. The child wanted an ice cream box with a panda 🐼 pattern, but it was no longer available. When I asked if I could help find it, she agreed and eventually helped the child find it. The child was very, very happy when he got the panda's little box. This was originally a merciless request from us, but I am really, really grateful that it was taken seriously and satisfied.

I have stayed in some hotels with better hardware conditions, but this time I was really impressed. Thank you to the hotel staff for their hard work and giving us a pleasant weekend. The children reluctantly want to play again and will go again if there is a chance.

He was very polite and considerate, and the service was excellent! I have been to Tianjin several times recently and I feel that this hotel is very cost-effective.

I feel that it is very convenient no matter where I go. The service attitude is great. They are all very good. The staff will greet you warmly. Our group includes a dinner buffet. There are not many varieties, but the taste is pretty good. Mainly Southeast Asian flavors. There is my favorite laksa rice noodles. The tuna sashimi is very delicious. All in all, this is our stay. The experience completely exceeded expectations. I will definitely choose this hotel next time. It’s very nice~

When I call the guest room service number, I always respond to my request, unlike some hotels that say "just look for me again". The hotel provides a bed end for children, which is very practical and saves the need for piles of pillows to block the bed. Children's slippers and disposable bathtub covers are also provided. The imperial concubine couch in the room is also larger than expected. There is a set of blankets in the cabinet, so you can sleep on it directly. It's still a bit cool at night by the window. Overall it's worth staying again!

msg:We checked in at around 5pm on February 29, 2024, and checked out at noon on March 1, 2024. The hotel is generally good. The service attitude of the lady at the front desk was very good. The guy who came back to refill the room card at night was also very good. The service was thoughtful and meticulous, which deserves praise. When we checked out at noon, the lady called to verify, and her attitude was very good. The service of these staff members was very good. However, the security management is seriously inadequate. The security personnel on duty at the hotel's underground parking lot on the night of February 29 had serious problems. 1. Dressing. The top was not pulled up properly, and the chest was often exposed. The security personnel had a big belly and sat on a chair to play with their mobile phones. At least the hotel should pay attention to its image. Such security personnel are simply too mismatched. 2. Let's talk about work attitude. When encountering problems, they don't listen to customers, insist on their own way, speak super **, like the attitude of the **** in society, speak arrogantly, and speak a strange Mandarin. It's simply, is the hotel security here to serve, or do they want to beat people up? It's scary. They don't listen to customers when doing things, and their attitude is arrogant. It's just a rat **** that spoils the whole pot of porridge. 3. The work attitude is not positive and lazy. Which hotel security personnel will sit on a chair, lie on the table and play with their mobile phones, and show the influence of the hotel like this? May I ask if such people are qualified to work here? It's not a small hotel. Letting such people serve here simply lowers the image of the hotel. No matter what, such people should not work here. Not to mention the image and temperament, the most important work attitude is rubbish. If it weren't for the good attitude of the front desk staff, it really wouldn't be worth staying. I also took a lot of photos of the hotel room, so I won't comment on it. I just want to comment on this kind of security personnel who are not worthy of their positions.

Environment: The environment is good

I was a little worried that the facilities were a bit old, but I found them to be quite good and clean. It feels good to have the sun shining into the room. You can't see the Tianjin Eye from here. You can see some of it if you have a suite, but the location is really good. I went to Tianjin Eye one night. Everyone said it was more beautiful at night. After dinner at the hotel, I walked over leisurely and watched the old man fishing, the Internet celebrities singing and dancing, and a row of people. The photo was taken together, it was quite interesting along the way. The hotel also gave me a 300 yuan dining voucher and prepared a baby bowl and baby stool for me when I entered. The food was a bit expensive, but the taste was really good. The sesame chicken and lobster rice with rice were delicious.
The next morning, I walked to Ancient Culture Street, then to Italian Style Street, and then to Porcelain House. They were all nearby and the location was really good.

If I insisted on giving an hour, you would only be short of half an hour. For three nights in a row, you couldn't check out an hour and a half late. Service is really bad

The package included breakfast and executive afternoon tea (which can be understood as a simple dinner). The room came with welcome snacks and drinks. The front desk service was excellent. They gave me window grilles during the Spring Festival and also gave my children a college series signature pen. Special praise was given to a staff member named Du. When he learned that there were elderly people, he even gave him two footbath bags.
The location is excellent, with Ancient Culture Street and Lion Grove Bridge just outside the door. If the upstairs is facing well, you can see the Eye of Tianjin.
It's a little far from the subway, so it's very convenient to take a taxi.
Breakfast is very rich, you need to queue up during peak hours
Packages for booking rooms are usually more affordable.

Downstairs are Ancient Culture Street, Lion Grove Bridge, and Yanchun Building, a famous Tianjin cuisine restaurant; Tianjin Eye Ferris Wheel, Italian Style Area, and Li Shutong’s former residence are all within walking distance. Zhangyuan, Jingyuan, etc. are 3-4 kilometers away on foot, and we also strolled there... In other words, only the Fifth Avenue is 3-5 kilometers away, and several other popular city check-in spots are basically within walking distance of the hotel, so This avoids driving and parking during the heavy traffic jams during the Spring Festival.
In terms of facilities, it is slightly inferior to the five-star hotels such as Hyatt, InterContinental, Marriott, Accor and other international large groups where I often stay. It is not advanced and slightly old, but the location is good and the price is excellent, so it is cost-effective.
Dinner in the executive lounge is filling, with freshly cut black pepper lamb chops.
The main thing is that the service is very good. The people at the front desk, restaurant and lounge are all very friendly.
The window view is actually not that good. Most of the river view rooms cannot see the Ferris wheel. The windows are relatively old and not large, which affects the view. You can see the Ferris wheel from the bathtub in the VIP suite. The reading room in the executive lounge is also available.
There is a 30-year-old young man in the breakfast room who provides excellent service. He speaks Tianjin dialect, has a fashionable hairstyle, and is very enthusiastic!
The lady in the breakfast room is also very nice.
In general, if it is a city walk around the Haihe River, the Ferris Wheel, Ancient Culture Street, Lion Grove Bridge and Italian Style Street, it is in a relatively optimal location.

The river view is good from the high floor. When the passenger flow is heavy, the reception capacity needs to be strengthened. Ctrip wrote that check-in is at 15:00, and when we arrived at the hotel front desk at 17:00, we were told that the room would be cleaned at 19:00. The attitude was good. We stored our luggage and went out for a walk first. There was a long queue for breakfast on the first floor the next day. It is hoped that the hotel will fully prepare for the incident, such as arranging more cleaning personnel when the passenger flow is high, opening other restaurants during dining peaks, and other measures to improve the guests' hotel experience. Other aspects are good. The location is excellent. It is very close to Ancient Culture Street and Tianjin Eye. Free parking is available.

msg:The only advantage of this hotel is that it has a very good location. It is right on the edge of the Haihe River. Many scenic areas are very close. Next to it is the Ancient Culture Street, and you can also see the Eye of Tianjin. Even the lobby is not big, it is very small. The building is relatively high, and the overall feeling is that the room is not very big. I especially complained that the bathtub is too small. The overall service is not much advantageous. The staff feels indifferent and the service awareness of the staff is not very attentive.
The overall price/performance ratio of the hotel is not very high
The swimming pool is relatively small and the water temperature is relatively cool. The air conditioning in the room is not particularly good. It is either very hot or very cold when sleeping at night. The environment is not very good and the room feels a bit damp.

msg:We were at the hotel at 10:30 in the morning. Because we had elderly people and children checking in early, we upgraded the room. The room was very spacious, the twin beds were very large, and there was a concubine who could lie down very comfortably. The lady at the front desk was a great friend. A very senior foreman, very professional. I met her again on the day of check-out, because the lobby had already been decorated with a Chinese New Year a**osphere, and she asked her colleagues to take photos of us as souvenirs.
  Because there were 3 people staying, I asked Auntie Lu in the guest room to send slippers and shopping bags. The response was very fast and they were delivered in a short time. The little one was going swimming in the evening, but the old man didn't want to change his shoes. He wanted to sit with the outside window closed and watch the child swim. The girl at the swimming pool specially brought a floating board for training to the old man to cushion him. He was afraid that the old man would catch a cold. This was very thoughtful. . I especially saw her name brand called Alice Zhang and was very moved~
   My impression of staying at Pan Pacific this time is still great, and the service level is online.

I generally don't like to comment on the quality of hotels, but I felt a bit cheated after staying in this hotel. It's not worth more than 700 yuan, and it's not up to five-star standards. First of all: the room size is decent, the facilities are okay, the temperature in the room is too low, the drinks in the refrigerator are said to be free to drink, but what are they, they are all worthless expired drinks. Let’s talk about breakfast🥣. It is said to be NT$120, but I think it is not even worth NT$30. There is not a single hot stir-fry. I really don’t know how to rate such a five-star hotel.

I have lived in Pan Pacific in Suzhou, Xiamen, and Tianjin, and compared it with other brands in the same price range. I feel that Pan Pacific in Tianjin is the most cost-effective.
The bedding is good for a college student who is very leisurely and sleeps until he wakes up naturally.
The swimming pool is also the cleanest among them. The gym is also good.
The only drawback in terms of facilities is that there is no laundry room
The only drawback is that the blackout curtains in the room are not thick enough, the door panels are poorly soundproofed, and there is no dedicated doorman to take luggage. Room service keeps knocking on the door, which really disturbs sleep😫
It is recommended that in the future room service can be chosen by guests and they should not knock on the door all the time.

As a five-star hotel, the environment, services, and supporting facilities are all top notch! It’s so scary. I really wonder how this five-star review was rated!
After getting off the high-speed rail and taking a taxi to the hotel, and the next few days! I found that the hotel had no receptionist or doorman at all! Guests need to open and close the car doors and pick up their luggage themselves! I can't bear this! What surprised me the most was that the mattress in the room we stayed in collapsed! At first I thought it was because the mattress was too soft and I wasn’t used to sleeping on it! Later I thought I shouldn’t have stayed in so many hotels! After staying for two days, my baby and I woke up with backache every day! After a closer inspection, I discovered that the mattress had collapsed in the middle! No wonder I sleep so hard every day!
The entire hotel decoration facilities are seriously aging! Lack of maintenance! From the moment you enter the hotel and enter the room, you have a bad impression of being dimly lit! The tiles in the bathtub in the bathroom are also broken! And it’s hanging right next to the bathtub! This kind of room actually has great safety risks! If you change to another hotel, it must be closed for maintenance and repairs! But the Pacific side continues to open its doors to receive customers! It’s incredible!
Also, the waiter came and knocked on the door at around 9 o'clock in the morning and asked for room cleaning! I was stunned at the time! Because I had a late break from a party with friends the day before! And their bed was so uncomfortable to sleep on that I couldn’t sleep! As a result, I was woken up by their waiter as soon as I fell asleep at dawn! In short, there are so many weird things about this hotel! I will definitely not go there again.

msg:I booked a city view room at first. After arriving in Tianjin, I saw a nice view of the Haihe River. I wanted to pay to upgrade to a river view room, but I learned that there was a company meeting and the room might be tight. After learning about it, Ms. Leng at the front desk helped us upgrade the room for free. Thank you very much. The hotel is indeed a cost-effective choice among luxury hotels in Tianjin.

The hotel service is also very good. There were many guests during the National Day period, and the front desk quickly helped us allocate two rooms next to each other.
Parking is also very convenient, and the ground parking lot can facilitate guests to park.
Special thanks to Manager Du. After checking out, I left my mobile phone in the room and had already driven out of Beijing. The hotel called me to confirm the mobile phone. Manager Du immediately arranged for it to be delivered to my home by SF Express. Thank you very much. Thank you to the hotel staff for your kindness.
Also, the service provided by Lina, Jane and Arvin whom I met during my stay were very good and made me feel at home.
The night view of the high-rise hotel is also beautiful.

The first round of minibar is free: it’s great, and there’s also a small can of potato chips, which makes the kids happy.

msg:Because I had booked a night cruise on the Haihe River, I searched the map and found this hotel to be in a suitable location. It was also close to listening to cross talk at Ancient Culture Street the next day. Although the area difference in the 165-square-meter suite at the Tianjin Ritz-Carlton on the first night was a bit large, the executive floor at this price range included cross talk and was very cost-effective. The receptionist at the front desk was enthusiastic and efficient, and explained the check-in details clearly. The room is on the 27th floor. It doesn’t matter if you don’t have a city view. The executive lounge has a view on the 29th floor. Of course, the view of the Golden Steel Bridge across the road from the hotel is even better. After checking the reviews after booking, there were quite a few low scores. At first, I was very nervous and wanted to return. After the check-in experience, I didn’t feel that bad. The attitude of the front desk, lounge, floor customer service, and restaurant service staff was very good, and they didn’t step down. Let’s talk about the guest rooms. At 46 square meters, they are not very big, but the design is quite reasonable. There is a large couch next to the window, which is very suitable for families with children. There are two large wardrobes, which are convenient for storing luggage and hanging clothes. The tea bar is well designed. The bathroom is small and practical, with wet and dry separation. The shower room and bathtub are in a separate space, and the toilet is also a separate space, which is quite compact. The only shortcoming is that the TV is a bit too small. Let’s take a look at the night view of Tianjin!

For dinner, we checked into the Western restaurant on the first floor🍽. It was very comfortable to enter the exotic Southeast Asian environment of the restaurant. There is a wide variety of dishes, including a variety of seafood, prawns🦐, conch, crabs🦀, salmon, snow crab. There are also Japanese food, sushi rolls 🍣, and sashimi, which are full of experiences and very affordable.
My eyes lit up when I entered the room. The space of more than 40 square meters is very spacious for our family to live in. The room is neatly arranged and clean. Toiletries, slippers and bathrobes are all available.
With such comprehensive services, it deserves to be a five-star hotel. I will definitely stay here again next time I come to Tianjin! ! !

msg:I came to Tianjin to travel and stay at the Pan Pacific Hotel. My family likes it very much. The hotel service is very good. In particular, the manager of the swimming pool takes care of the children in every possible way. The swimming pool is less crowded and clean, which makes parents feel at ease. The hotel is next to the Haihe River, away from Tianjin Eye and ancient culture. The streets are very close, and it is not far from the Haihe Wharf of the Great Depression, within walking distance, the location is excellent. The breakfast has a variety of varieties, but there are many people in the summer and they have to queue up after 9 o'clock. The next time I go to Tianjin, I will still choose Pan Pacific Hotel

msg:The room we stayed in had a view of the imperial concubine. For an additional 80 yuan, you can upgrade the bed-making service. It's no problem for an adult to sleep there. If the waiter can make do with it, he can even ask for sheets. The breakfast is good, with many kinds, including Tianjin pancakes, fruits, old tofu and so on. The waiter was able to collect the plates and turn the tables in time, so there was no need to wait for a table even during the Spring Festival breakfast. The only drawback is the problem of smoking in the room. The previous one to us probably smoked in the bathroom. The smell of smoke in the toilet and bathroom was very strong, and the exhaust system was not good. Later, the hotel sent an air purifier. The hotel said that some rooms allow smoking. I hope that next time I can make a note of the option to choose a non-smoking room.

msg:Hardware: The price/performance ratio in a 5-star hotel is very high! The room is 76 square meters, with sufficient space. In addition to the living room and bedroom, the cloakroom and bathroom are of sufficient size. The room furnishings, especially the wine cabinet, are very traditional, and the bathroom can sit down and take a shower, which is very friendly to the elderly.

Service: The overall service response is fast and the consciousness is strong! Manager Du at the front desk provided follow-up service throughout our stay, which is relatively rare in the front desk service of five-star hotels. Especially when I saw that I took the elderly and children with me, gave them full care in terms of needs, and took the initiative to help communicate and solve the appeals, and personally sent welcome fruit to the guest room. When I learned that I wanted to see the night view of the Ferris wheel, I specifically told that I could go to the reading room to watch it. . Xiao Wang Xiaoxue in the executive lounge is active and patient in service, and has a strong sense of initiative. When I found that there was a problem with the automatic curtains in the bedroom, the guest room lady and the engineer quickly came to solve the problem.

A few highlights:
First, the room service is very good. I came back to order food after nine o'clock in the evening, and it was delivered in about half an hour. A handsome little brother brought in a small table dining cart, and the dining table was left in the room for use, which was particularly high-end, and the child was very happy. I ordered seafood pizza, creamy mushroom soup, and tuna salad, all of which are exquisite, plentiful, fresh, and not expensive. Here is just a suggestion, the pepper in the four rings of tuna can be a little less.
The second is that the hotel provides private beds for the sofa in the suite and the chaise longue in the ordinary room, which provides absolute convenience and cost-effectiveness for family travel, and the service is very mature and fast, which is worthy of recognition and recommendation!
The third is the complimentary light meal in the executive lounge, which is enough for dinner, and it comes with Starbucks coffee, various juice drinks and alcohol, which is very rare. The steamed noodles, small cakes, and fruits are all very good. There are not many hot dishes, but as a gift, it is really good!
Fourth, there are welcome fruits, milk and biscuits before going to bed, which are very considerate.
Fifth, there is Starbucks coffee, which is really convenient. The ice cream balls and birthday cakes in the lobby bar are very good choices. The ice cream balls are 9 yuan each, and the price is moderate.
Sixth, the executive lounge has also set up a reading room, which basically contains English books, a large sofa and a few pairs of small sofas, and Lego toys. It is recommended to increase Chinese books appropriately.
Seventh, the breakfast is a five-star breakfast that can be seen on the table. In addition to the regular breakfast, there is even beer.
Overall, I think it is a very cost-effective and sincere five-star hotel, and I sincerely recommend it to everyone. Rather than saying it is an online celebrity hotel, I think it is an old traditional five-star hotel with mature service quality and style.

msg:The hotel environment and location are excellent. You can see the Lion Grove Bridge and the riverside at night, but the room faces east and you can't see the Ferris wheel. Just outside the door is Ancient Culture Street, which is so convenient. Downstairs is Yanchun Restaurant, but there were too many people queuing up, and the queue had already closed before 12 o'clock. It was a pity that we didn't get to eat. The service is pretty good, and there are free lucky bags in the room. The only flaw is that we originally booked two double rooms. When we checked in, the front desk saw the three of us and asked if we wanted to change to a twin room. They also said that a twin room would be cheaper. After we checked in, we discovered that we had changed to a twin room. Facing west, there is no view to see, and there are no drinks in the refrigerator. Although I didn't drink the free drinks in the refrigerator in the double room, it was still uncomfortable. When checking out, they were told that the price was the same. So why did we change to a twin room? This is a bad review

The bedding is okay and the pillows are quite comfortable. The service is also satisfactory. The catering is not very good, the dishes are more expensive and the quantity is small. The seafood tomato noodles cost 38 yuan for a small bowl, which is a scam. Expensive and tasteless. The breakfast meal is single and not worth the 120 yuan. However, the hotel manages the breakfast entrance well and it would be better if it can limit the flow in advance.

No, when I proactively asked the service staff to collect it, the first reaction of the staff was not that the hotel's work was not in place and causing inconvenience to the guests, but that the front desk had not given it to them. Haha, I really don't know how many false claims they have experienced before they are so vigilant! I originally thought it would be nice to get a gift during the Chinese New Year, but the experience was negative because the software couldn’t keep up!

msg:I chose a lot of hotels before arriving in Tianjin, and I chose the "Pan Pacific Hotel" after thousands of choices. When I got to the hotel room, I thought to myself: Sure enough, I was not disappointed. Because there are a lot of guests in the hotel during the peak tourist season, sometimes you can't check in on time, but the staff will call in advance to communicate. For example, we booked two rooms, and the stipulated check-in time is 3 pm, because I asked the two rooms to be on the same floor. At noon, the staff communicated with us on the phone that one room would be available at 4:30 and the other room at 5:30. I said that I would not accept it. My mother in her 70s wanted to rest after lunch. Upon learning of this, the staff immediately coordinated a room that had just been cleaned up for my mother to live in first. We still entered the room at 5:30. I am very grateful that the hotel thinks what people think, and provides high-quality services to guests in a hurry. Because the check-in time was late, the hotel upgraded the city view room I booked to the river view room, which surprised me and my family. In addition, the waiter in room 1409 was very considerate and brought fruit. I asked her if I needed an extra quilt, and it was done right away, which was very satisfying. There are many options for people to travel and stay in hotels, such as B&Bs, express hotels, and such traditional hotels. To be honest, I prefer such old-fashioned hotels. The managers and service personnel basically learned hotel management. They are more professional and capable of providing the best service for the guests. The key is that the price of the hotel is not high ~ the location is convenient and superior ~ the room facilities are clean and tidy ~ don't you think it's delicious?

Disposable items are not provided in the room, if necessary, you can call the room service to send them quickly.

The children like it very much and play in it for a long time every day. And look forward to coming back next time!

Check-in was quick and he helped to upgrade the room. Room 1901 has a nice view, and you can see the river and Tianjin Eye. The room is big, hygienic and clean. You can enjoy different scenery by walking along the river in the morning and evening.

I helped make the chaise longue into a small bed early on and gave the children a little lion doll. The room depar**ent is really ingenious. The panda with the towel is so cute. We sent us plenty of bottled water. Thank you very much for the care of the hotel staff. The bathroom area is very large. What I like most is that the rain shower and the bathtub are combined. This design no longer worries about the children getting water everywhere. Parking is convenient. Customer free

msg:I decided to come to Tianjin on the spur of the moment. I originally wanted to go to the Intercontinental Hotel. Later, I decided on this hotel because I thought it was close to the river. Then began this unpleasant journey. Let’s talk about the room first. When I checked in, I asked for a high-rise room with a river view, but when I arrived, I was given the 19th floor, a total of 30 floors. How can I have a river view once I go in? I went downstairs to the front desk and negotiated to change to the 11th floor. There were two other people in the same group. When we checked in, we said we could wait and arrange them on the first floor, but the front desk said that we couldn't lock the room without notifying us in advance, so we had to open it. Let’s separate it. The other two rooms need to be cleaned for one hour each. Yes, it takes two hours in total. Thinking that the holidays are busy, we will put our luggage together and wait for us to send us our room cards. We also confirmed with the front desk that if the cleaning is complete, we will send the room cards of the other two rooms to the room we have already checked in. , the front desk said it has been recorded. Okay, let's go play. After 3 hours, we said hello, but we didn't agree, but we didn't give us a room card, and we asked for it. Then I talked about the swimming pool. I took my children to the swimming pool and told me that adults must go into the water with me to swim. It cannot be said that it is a hotel regulation if you don’t go into the water. I just want to say that this regulation is reasonable? I can't swim, what can I do if I go down? If there is a safety problem, don't I have to save myself first? Besides, hotels with swimming pools must be equipped with safety lifeguards. InterContinental, Banyan Tree, clubmed, Marriott... I have lived too many times, and no one has ever said that underage swimming guardians must enter the water. The hotel refuses me because the guardian cannot swim if the guardian cannot enter the water. Is it reasonable to enjoy this hotel right? Relevant regulations also say that if accompanied by a guardian, you can go into the water without any requirement. What's even more funny is that when I went again after a while, I was let in without asking any questions. After I went in, I realized why I was stopped just now, because there was no security officer at all! Are hotel policies child's play? The service is too bad, choose carefully, anyway, I will never decide on this one after all my life

Secondly, the room is really average. The main reason is that the sanitary environment is very poor. Many places have not been cleaned and are filled with dirt. The layout of the room is average, and the lighting is not very good, so choose carefully if you need to work! As for the service, we asked for a pillow at 10:30, but it wasn't delivered. We called again to urge it, and it wasn't delivered until 2 in the middle of the night. And try not to drink the drinks provided by the hotel. This was the first time I drank a spicy drink. The last and most important thing is that after I checked out, I started to feel allergic and itchy. This was not a good experience! ! !

At 5:30 in the evening, you can go to the 29th floor to have an executive light meal. There is no problem as a dinner
The location of the hotel is excellent. It is very convenient to go to Minyuan for dinner, to visit the Fifth Avenue, and to go to the pier to take a boat at night. It is only a few minutes' walk to the Ancient Culture Street. It is also very convenient to take a taxi from the high-speed rail station
The breakfast is very good, there are many types of pancakes with Tianjin characteristics

This time it was full of surprises~ Pan Pacific Tianjin Hotel has an excellent location, very close to the Ancient Culture Street, Haihe Ship Terminal, etc., and the transportation is convenient. I highly recommend it. Staying in the lobby of the big hotel is very warm and comfortable, and there is a sweet aroma when you enter the door. The hotel has a free parking lot, and the service of the lady at the front desk is super good. The baby gave a little mermaid doll when she entered the door, and told us that there is a surprise when entering the room. I ordered a parent-child room on Ctrip to play a cool little yellow duck. Looking at the pictures on Ctrip, it feels good. My baby will definitely like it. Who knew that after opening the door, I was really surprised. When I entered the door, I saw the dining room, lounge, table, refrigerator, oven, etc. Go inside Walking is a super large and spacious room, like a suite, with swings, slides, small tents that children like to play, and many small dolls, everything! The hotel service staff also thoughtfully prepared a gift box of fruit and pastries 💝 full of heart, the room is spacious, clean and hygienic, the bathroom and toilet are perfect, and the bathing pool has water toys that the baby likes. Every corner is spotless and you can live with peace of mind. After a short rest, the doorbell rang and opened the door. I was very happy. The hotel's foreman manager, the beautiful lady, and a particularly happy aunt gave my little baby a new gift (ps: the baby is a little bit of a baby. Take it out), a little yellow duck schoolbag with puzzles in it, a doll and the hotel’s homemade panda 🐼 doll, which is actually made of simple materials such as towels, but its ingenuity is amazing... The parents and children selected this time Husband Fang is amazing, my baby likes to play and is very happy, the breakfast buffet is very complete and delicious, the overall service and other aspects are excellent, I will come again next time🌹

msg:A hotel that pursues profit and likes to play IQ tax.
The headquarters of Pan Pacific Hotel is a Singapore company. Based on the trust in the brand, I booked a deluxe double room for the weekend. I left with my family full of expectations, and I got a lot of dissatisfaction.
1. The price increases during holidays, and the IQ tax price increases when there are many people
The lobby is very small. When I arrived at the store, I found that the hotel was full. Looking at the real-time booking price of the hotel, it was outrageous. According to a certain platform, the pre-ordered price of a 40-square-meter luxury city view king-bed room is 1,999 yuan, while the pre-ordered price of a 76-square-meter VIP suite is also 1,999 yuan (Figure 2). Is it a hotel discount? No, the hotel found that there were too many people staying, so it hastened to increase the reservation price of the double bed room, from the original more than 900 to 1999. Isn't it worth it for all guests to book suites? Sorry, the room is full, but there is actually no room.
2. Charge the room fee before checking out, which violates the payment agreement when leaving the hotel
I booked through the platform with "Pay after leaving the store", and I was still in the hotel room. I received a reminder after 10:00 am that the payment has been deducted and the order has been completed (Figure 6). Have I left the store? I was still in the room (Figure 7), and I was "paid after leaving the hotel". Is the hotel driving the guests away or is it short of the interest for a few hours before and after this? It really is the shrewd management of Singapore.
3. The robot is a low-end version (Figure 3), which can only deliver goods without interactive dialogue function, and the sound setting of the speaker is very low. If it is not in an absolutely quiet environment, you will not hear the robot and the voice reminding at all. Why not not open.
4. The welcome fruit will not be delivered without urging (Figure 4), and after more than four hours of check-in, I was called and urged to tell "it is ready to deliver".
5. In a hotel that has been in business for 8 years, the phone in the room still uses all English keys and English screen interface (Figure 5). Is this treating Chinese guests as foreign guests or using Chinese as the hotel's unofficial service language?
In short, in terms of price, room size, and service quality, the price is on the high side, and there are many hotels of the same star level nearby. The price/performance ratio is not worth it.

msg:This trip is the first time to bring a baby together, because the child is still young and not sure about his schedule, so he walked all the way to play. Check-in is already 8:00 pm, but after arriving at the store, the check-in procedure is very simple and fast. Due to the May Day tourist peak The parking space is almost full, and after telling the garage service staff that it is inconvenient to park on the ramp with children, they quickly found a suitable parking space for us~ Communicate with the front desk because the child is under one year old and needs a crib, and I am afraid that the child will be sleepy and anxious to see it The Haihe night view service staff also delivered the crib to the room very quickly👍But the crib is a little old and the mattress is not very smooth. In the end, it is more comfortable to use a small quilt as a mattress.
After checking out the next day, just in time for the kids to have lunch, I asked for hot water in the downstairs restaurant and borrowed a place to feed the kids. Even though it was closing time, the sisters were very enthusiastic to help fetch water, paper towels and move the dining chairs. ! Thank you so much~
Overall, I can score 10 out of 10 for this stay! It is recommended to stay with children!

msg:The day before the May Day holiday, I decided to go to Tianjin on the spur of the moment. I chose this hotel for a long time. I originally booked a family room. I made a note to bring the elderly and children. I hope to arrange a room that can see the Eye of Tianjin as much as possible. Later, I received a call from Ctrip, saying that the hotel can directly see some room types in one direction of the Tianjin Eye, and it is a holiday, so there is a high probability that it cannot be satisfied. Anyway, I didn't have any expectations at first, and it didn't matter. As a result, when I checked in at the store, I upgraded to a suite, the floor was twice as high, and I could still see the Tianjin Eye! It was a pleasant surprise that such an arrangement could be given during the special period of the May Day holiday. The baby was very happy when she arrived in the room, and praised repeatedly while jumping. Thank you very much for the hotel's arrangement this time, which left a very good impression of Tianjin for the baby and the elderly~
If I have to say something wrong, one is that the sound insulation of the windows is poor. There are fireworks outside in the middle of the night, and the sound is quite obvious in the room; the other is the electric lift curtain. Although it looks high-end, its shading performance is average. Some people may interfere with sleep.
Overall, the experience is higher than expected, praise~

msg:We stayed in this hotel in 2020, so we directly chose his home for this weekend trip. The hotel is clean and tidy, with a parking lot, the room is big enough, and the night view is invincible. The hotel is near the ancient cultural street, not far from the Ferris wheel. The restaurant across the road downstairs has very good Tianjin-style dishes, so we came here specially. The service of the hotel is also in place, and it is the first time to enjoy VIP trea**ent. Someone contacted me the day before check-in and asked me what I needed. The lady at the front desk who checked in was also very enthusiastic, and told me how to get to the northwest corner of the internet celebrity check-in place. In the evening, the lobby manager sent a robot to give the child a small surprise. My wife was very friendly. The next day's breakfast is also high-end, with Western-style pastries, pancakes and fruits. There is also a swimming pool and a sauna. It may be weekdays, there are not many people, the service is too good, must praise👍

I wanted to cast the screen to watch 1988, but I can only watch it with my ipad. 2. The movement of the exhaust fan at the entrance of the 27th floor where I live is a bit loud, and it may be my own reason. My friend thinks White noise is just right! Other aspects are impeccable. I can iron the clothes. Although I forgot to iron the clothes... I can go to the front desk at night to get a microwave for supper. Haha!

msg:The hotel has a three-star appearance, four-star rooms, and one-star breakfast. The lobby space is small and the layout is simple and plain. The location is a bit better, by the Haihe River, (but now the Haihe River and Tianjin Eye Magic Skywheel have no lights at night). Parking is more convenient, the rooms are more spacious, the bedding is fairly comfortable, the breakfast is terrible, on the 29th floor In the small hall, there are too many people in the peak season, so you have to wait for a seat. The fried vegetables are tasteless, the salad only has two kinds of vegetables, and the bread is not freshly baked. This hotel has no value for money.

There is a problem with the construction of the second west gate. It is actually a parking lot. The passage and way for guests to walk are not obvious, and the lobby is not big, which is a bit different from star hotels.

Knowing that I was on the high-speed train in the middle of the night and arrived in Tianjin early in the morning, Manager Du immediately helped me arrange an upgraded room type that could be checked in at around 8:00 in the morning, which made me feel the hotel care that I have not experienced for a long time due to the epidemic. The fruits delivered to the room in the afternoon also make this spring more refreshing. The next time you go to Tianjin on business, you must lock in Tianjin Pan Pacific.

I looked online for a long time, compared many hotels, and finally chose Pan Pacific Hotel Tianjin. First of all, in terms of location, shopping is very convenient. Downstairs It's the Haihe River. The Tianjin Eye is just a few steps away from the hotel. The view is still very good. The little brother who checked in at the hotel lobby is very considerate. He knew that I was pregnant and chose a non-smoking floor. The facilities in the room are good. The only complaint is the mattress. The mattress is too soft. If you usually feel very comfortable, it is really unfriendly to pregnant women. After sleeping all night, your back hurts. There are no other problems, so you can choose boldly👍

The service awareness of the staff is poor, as if it was the same thing before.
The sound insulation of the door is poor, no one is talking outside, it is really quiet 🤣
The hygiene of the room is poor, mainly due to the hygiene details and dead corners.
For example, there is dust on the bathroom mirror...
There is dust and fluff in the kettle, the kind of fluff left after being wiped with a rag, ugh! Why……
The facilities are old, well, if managed well, old facilities can be maintained well.

But the scenery of the Haihe River is still so beautiful

She specially reminded that the surrounding area of the hotel is affected by the New Year activities on the Ancient Culture Street, and there is traffic control at night, so it is recommended not to drive out. The service personnel on the floor actively ask about the requirements for room arrangement and cleaning. The service staff in the restaurant are responsive, the dishes are delicious, and there are many varieties of breakfast. You can eat small steamed buns, fried cakes, and pancakes with Tianjin characteristics. Although the hotel has been open for a long time, the hotel is clean and tidy.

The hotel is still pretty good, by the Haihe River, the sun is sunny and the weather is warm, it is still very nice to go for a walk to bask in the sun ☀️. Thanks to the lady at the front desk for arranging the room for us, and you can also see Tianjin Eye from the window of the cloakroom.

Ancient Culture Street and the northwest corner can be walked. There are several Tianjin restaurants downstairs in the hotel, shop early.
The only downside is that the room is a bit cold, and I dare not put my arms outside when I sleep at night, so I have to wrap them in a quilt. The bathroom and shower room are cooler, and the feeling of taking a shower is not good.

msg:The long-lost feeling of being at home from the moment you step into the hotel door to check in is back. When I entered the room and wanted to go to the bathroom for convenience, I was disgusted. I called the room service and hoped to clean it up. It didn't take long for the leader who seemed to be in charge to come to the room to check. I changed to a room with a river view. This response speed exceeded my imagination. I was impressed by this kind of service, which does not mean anything else. The new room can see the night view of the Haihe River, very satisfied. But the cleanliness of the room is too unflattering. I understand the busyness, but it should be that the cleaning staff did not have their work checked by the superior supervisor. After wiping the floor, some of them were old diseases, and some were indeed not cleaned carefully. It can be wiped clean. You can feel it from looking at the hygienic environment, it's all dealing with it. If it is well maintained, it will definitely not be in such a state. Really feel spoiled. The staff said that they would send a fruit plate and then there was no more. It was really not a fruit plate, but it was just a talk. I suddenly felt that our boss often said that training is the best management, and today I very much agree with this statement.

I told the front desk that I wanted to change the room. The front desk manager with the same name and surname as me actively solved the problem and helped me upgrade to a suite! There is a view of the Tianjin Eye outside the window! High floors and quiet! Let me praise the mattress. I like staying in hotels very much. I go to the hotel to live and play when I have nothing to do at home. In recent years, the hotel mattresses I have stayed in have not been as comfortable as the Pan Pacific! You can fall asleep when you lie down.. The lumbar support is very good and there is no sense of existence! The shower has plenty of water! The cleaning and room staff are very professional, and they can politely and quickly meet the needs of guests! It was noted in the order that I wanted a purifier, and it was already put away for me in the room. The breakfast is top-notch, and it can’t be compared with the breakfast that specializes in brunch. If there are a few more dishes, it will be more worthy of five stars! In short, objectively speaking, this stay is very happy and comfortable, and the price/performance ratio is good, not only because of the upgrade 😄, I will choose Pan Pacific next time I go to Tianjin!

msg:Came to Tianjin on the weekend after New Year's Day to eat and drink. I chose the Pan Pacific with its own free parking and charging spaces, but when I arrived at the gate, I found that the car was overcrowded? ? ? People are stupid and say that there is a meeting in the past few days, so when we have to check in, we can only park on the side of the road. But after we got to the front desk and reported the situation to the staff, the lady at the front desk immediately helped us arrange a room upgrade from The big bed room was upgraded to a suite and later helped us arrange a parking space in the parking lot. Here is a big compliment!
Facilities: After all, it’s a decent pan Pacific, so there’s nothing wrong with living there. The toiletry set is also from Balmain (how can I remember that it wasn’t this when I stayed in a double room)
Hygiene: One small flaw is that there are some dead flies by the window, a little bit of that
Environment: The suite that was upgraded for us for free is still the view room of the Tianjin Eye, but I don’t know why the Tianjin Eye was not opened this time? ? I didn't turn on the lights... I was blinded by others' good intentions
Service: Of course there is no such thing as 100%~

msg:Coming to New Year's Eve with my little sisters, the overall experience was very poor.
Parking: Arrived at the hotel at 5:30 in the evening, and the car was not parked until 7:00. There was no space in the above-ground parking lot or the underground garage. There was no staff to guide or divert people at the door in time. The personnel were told that there was no parking space and they had to go to other areas of the building to park. As a result, the building waited for a long time and did not wait for a parking space. When they returned downstairs, the staff at the parking lot had a very good attitude and told us "There is no place to park. If you are in a hurry, just go ahead." Let's go." In the middle of the check-in, we also reflected the situation with the front desk, and they all told us that there was no other way but to wait in line. It wasn't until after seven o'clock that it was too late to argue with the front desk before we were asked to wait for a special person to guide and deal with it. Finally, we didn't see the so-called special processing person until we waited until the parking space left the hotel.
Room: We booked a suite. We have stayed in many hotels of the same type on both sides of the Haihe River. The minibar is empty and the room only has three bottles of mineral water. This is the first time we have stayed in a five-star hotel suite. I asked for toiletries from the guest room, but they couldn't deliver them in half an hour. From 22 to 23 years, the urging process was just to inform that there were not enough people, no apologies, no measures, just like parking, you just wait.
Overall, I feel that the management of the hotel is very poor. It is understandable that there are many guests with full rooms, but it is definitely not an excuse for poor service to prevaricate guests.

msg:After checking in, I seriously doubt whether this is a five-star hotel (personal experience, for your reference):
1. It was approaching eleven o'clock, and the bath water became colder and colder. I called the front desk and said that there were too many people taking a bath, so let's not let it go and wait. I didn't say when I would come, and the time was already past midnight. , did not heat up, barely took a bath with warm water;
2. After taking a shower, I was pleasantly surprised to find that only one bathrobe was hung up for two people staying in (the picture was requested later);
3. There is nothing in the minibar. The free water is two bottles of ice dew. To use the freezer, you must first contact the hotel service center;
4. The so-called welcome fruit is shown in the picture;
5. The landscape of the river view room upgraded with money is shown in the picture, you can see for yourself;
6. I was tormented by the sound of water all night. When I woke up in the morning, I found that the toilet flush button was pressed and I couldn’t get up. It was really irritable and powerless to encounter such a thing in the middle of the night;
Some personal minefields:
7. The TV in the hotel is really really small, not even better than some fast ones;
8. The restaurant on the first floor is not big. We went downstairs at 9:20 and were told that we had to wait for a table. The food was arranged irregularly, so it was hard to find even though there were not many varieties. The special pancakes and fruits were long in line and tasted bad. Personally, I think it is not worth the price increase. to order.
Summary: The location of the hotel is okay, it is close to the Ancient Culture Street, but the surrounding facilities (such as convenience stores, etc.) are far away, and there are no riders to take orders at night. After a problem occurs, some shop assistants have a better attitude to remedy it, but the defect exists objectively and cannot be changed. In general, as an old five-star hotel, it is somewhat unworthy of its name, which is very disappointing.

1. I am a member, but I was given a very irregular room 2408
2. Ask the front desk to borrow a ruler for children to draw pictures. The male concierge has a good attitude, but the short-haired female receptionist said no without even raising her head.
3. The room is not well cleaned, papers cannot be drawn out one by one, I have to help them take them out again
4. Insufficient breakfast supply, many tabletops are not stable
5. Strange to say, all the male employees (or lobby, parking lot, or restaurant) have a good service attitude, but the attitude of the female employees I met is average. Is it too tired?
6. Even if you are a member, you will never come again

The lobby on the 1st floor is very small, and it is very crowded when you enter. There is no doorman to guide you. It took more than half an hour to check in. The staff have poor service awareness and the room hygiene is average. The overall stay experience is lower than that of Atour and other hotels in the whole season, which is not up to the 5-star standard. Breakfast was very bad.

The hotel where we normally pay for stays is at least hygienic It needs to be cleaned, as evidenced by the watermark camera, 11 o'clock in the evening is exactly the same as 7 o'clock in the morning. There is no cleaning at all. This is the case for two consecutive days. If there is no cleaning, is it because people don’t have sugar, tobacco and alcohol? Tianjin, a municipality directly under the Central Government, with this level of service and standards, I went on a business trip instead of attending the so-called sugar, tobacco and alcohol party, and the lobby staff had a very bad attitude. There was no sense of service that any five-star hotel should have. Fluent in Tianjin dialect, but also drunk. I have stayed in the worst five-star hotel in history. There is no one.

msg:This year, I went to Tianjin during the Mooncake Festival. I stayed in an executive room for 4 consecutive days and was not upgraded. There were a lot of people when I checked in, and the service was relatively indifferent. What I want to complain about is the background picture and sound insulation behind the bed. This picture is a famous bridge in Tianjin, and everyone doesn't like it very much. The executive room is very small. The soundproofing of the room is so bad that the curtains in the next room can be heard. However, the hotel also has a small speaker in each room. Fortunately, I stayed next door for 1 day [Arrogant ]. The executive breakfast is served on the 29th floor. Except for Starbucks, you can go to the 1st floor to eat. The billboard at the entrance says that the chicken chop wonton is fake, and there is no such thing. The female manager who wears black clothes on the executive floor can provide services. Other female managers who wear black clothes do not say hello at all. The location of the hotel is good, the breakfast also has local characteristics, but the soundproofing is almost...

msg:Location traffic:
The location is good, it is located near the Jingang Bridge by the Haihe River, and the hotel is relatively close to the Eye of Tianjin. You can walk or ride [wit]

parking:
The hotel has free parking spaces. Remember to register at the front desk when you leave the store. Only if you give a parking ticket, it’s free.

Room view:
I chose the Pacific Suite. The room layout is reasonable. Due to the angle of the house, there is no complete floor-to-ceiling window. You need to look for an angle from the window to see the Eye of Tianjin! But the night view is still beautiful!

Room facilities:
The overall feeling needs to be improved! For the suite, I personally feel that the TV is still a bit smaller. I live on the 23rd floor and the windows are not tightly sealed! When it is raining and windy, there will be a whirring noise due to the high floor! To be honest, this affects the experience very much! In addition, the electric curtains of the hotel are broken. It is recommended that the hotel should strengthen the maintenance of facilities! Regular maintenance!

service:
 The deepest feeling during this stay is that the service is very good! The reservation was for check-in the day before the Mid-Autumn Festival. Unexpectedly, the afternoon before check-in, the hotel called a greeting phone and asked if there were any needs, whether they needed decoration, etc. Since it is a holiday check-in, the hotel should be very busy, but In this case, I was really touched to call for greetings. [强] Informed that he wanted to check in early, and he happily agreed. Check in before 10 am, thank you very much! After arriving at the hotel, the young lady who checked in at the front desk was very enthusiastic and gave an introduction to the political lounge [rose]

Cost performance:
There are many five-star hotels on both sides of the Haihe River. I chose this place because I feel that the price is high. The suites enjoy the trea**ent of the executive lounge. There is free Starbucks coffee. If you like it, don’t miss it! In addition, the sofa in the living room can be used for an adult to sleep. If necessary, the hotel will also help you make the sofa into a single bed[强]

msg:Tianjin Pan Pacific Hotel is located at No. 1 Zhangzizhong Road in the urban area, with a superior location and convenient travel. It is 3 minutes away from Ancient Culture Street in the 5A Scenic Area and 15 minutes away from the ancient building Drum Tower. The surrounding restaurants are all famous old Tianjin dishes. The hotel’s supporting facilities are high-end, the bedroom and bathroom are soundproofed and do not affect each other, and the room is spacious and well-lit, and you can clearly see Tianjin’s Mother River ~ Haihe from the bedroom. The front desk staff at the hotel have a good attitude, warm and polite, and the overall conditions are among the best in luxury hotels. But the breakfast meal gave me a bit of opinion: a northern aunt in her 60s who wore a blue coat did not wear a mask. She took her chopsticks and went to the pot to pick up dishes, then put the dishes in her mouth and chewed and then went to pick up another pot. During the epidemic, neither wearing a mask nor using public chopsticks or communal food grippers was not used for the dishes in the restaurant. This behavior is worrying. It was reflected to the catering service staff and did not remind or warn the aunt, so that the appetite was seriously affected. Dare to eat again. This is a hint of kind advice in the affirmation of quality hotels.

I stayed for a long time in the afternoon, but something was delayed later. I needed to check out a bit later and get the front desk to deal with it properly. Manager Du in the lobby also specially sent the hotel's toiletry bag and asked about the check-in experience, and his attitude was very good👍
The hotel is relatively close to the Eye of Tianjin, a ten-minute walk along the Haihe River, and a ten-minute drive from both Tianjin Railway Station and Tianjin West Railway Station. Next time I come to Tianjin, I will consider staying in.

msg:It takes less than two hours to drive from Beijing to the hotel, and the road conditions are very good. There are plenty of parking spaces in the hotel, and in-house guests can park for free. The front desk and lobby services are quite good, but the check-in time is too long. I booked two executive rooms, but I couldn't see the Ferris wheel. It's a pity. One of the two rooms is on the 27th floor and the other is on the 28th floor. However, the room card can only be swiped to the floor where I am staying. If I want to find my family on the 28th floor, I have to go up the fire escape, otherwise I can only take the elevator to the first floor to find the lobby. The manager swipes the card. This design is no one. The layout of the room on the 28th floor is also very strange. The toilet is next to the sink. This design is too genius.
   The rooms are fine, good hygiene and clean. The facilities are slightly old. Breakfast is very average, nothing to eat. The dinner buffet is ok, and the price is not expensive. Guests on the executive floor can go to the executive lounge on the 29th floor for free all day long. There is a simple meal for dinner from 5 to 8 in the afternoon. The dishes are simple and full. The breakfast is served from the first floor with few varieties, but the environment is better and cleaner. At other times, there are only two or three small biscuits and a little fruit. Although the coffee says Starbucks coffee service, the taste is very ordinary.
    Stayed for three days to catch up with the heavy rain in Tianjin ⛈ basically stayed in the room to watch the Olympics. There are no entertainment facilities in the hotel, and the swimming pool on the fourth floor is very small. The water may be a bit cold due to the weather.
    Generally speaking, Pan Pacific Hotel can only be regarded as a four-star business hotel. The overall service software and hardware are not as good as the Banyan Tree on the opposite side of the road, but the address location is better. Before I left, the rain finally stopped, and I saw the double rainbow 🌈🌈 and the rose sunset. The Ferris wheel and Haihe River in the sunset are very beautiful.

缺點:1.由於飛機延誤，到酒店已經凌晨一點多了，前台那個KURT HAN像是欠他幾百萬的樣子，服務態度這麼差，不想幹服務行業可以轉行，客人不想花錢來看你的臭臉。白天都是女前台，晚上衹有一個男前台值班，不想值晚班你找經理提，別把臭臉脾氣留給客户！
2.房間很老舊了，特別是牆紙發黴，貴妃榻的木頭黴斑看起來有點噁心。
3.衞生間真心不乾淨，特別是洗髮水的瓶子根本就按不出洗髮水，按一次要去提一次才能按一點點出來，真的無語了，難道你們裝的時候不試試？馬桶不乾淨……
4.早餐中規中矩，連續兩天煮麪的阿姨都説沒湯了，我想説你這小三角桶子裝這點湯能煮幾碗麪呢，到底是不是真心要給客户煮麪的，第一次看到這麼天才的酒店麪攤。
5.定的至尊河景房竟然衹看到一點點的河，請問酒店這種房型確定配得上至尊？當時以為可以看到天津之眼才定這種房型，慎入。

msg:地理位置：超級棒！酒店位於張自忠路1號，三岔河口這一天津發祥地。步行1公里可以抵達天津之眼，步行2公里可以去到意式風情區。距離大悲院（永樂碼頭）數百米，乘坐遊船極為方便。
設施與服務：酒店的設施較好，洗手間和衞生間較大，乾濕分離，有浴缸。mini吧飲品，礦泉水，熨衣板及熨斗，送餐機器人等。前台和客房服務人員熱情，素質高，住的比較舒服。建議選擇河景房，可以坐在窗邊的沙發躺椅上看着河上的遊船發呆。
餐食：有一家百年餐飲老店，燕春樓，強烈推薦，當地人也很多在此就餐，爆三樣，燜牛肉，芫爆散丹等都很棒。酒店的自助餐也不錯，環境和菜品不錯，尤其是煎餅和嘎巴菜，必須要吃！
總體感覺很棒，以後來天津還是想住這裏。

1.建議給員工做好崗前培訓、詢問門衞該酒店屬於幾星級不詳，建議我去問門僮。
2大門地面多處開裂、塌陷、地磚不穩
3.電梯清理不及時、進店時的手印、離店還在門上
4.房間內電視過小、壁紙有開裂起翹、各處玻璃膠打磨不專業、衞生死角過多
5.早餐品種不少但不精、豆腐腦工具不應該是勺子應換為鏟子、菜品味道一般、雖然餐飲部總監與總經理（猜的）都有巡視但工作重點不應是收台、應該是品嚐，感覺價位也就80塊錢左右合適，我是免費早餐（別誤會）
還有部分問題我就沒必要説了，仁者見仁智者見智吧

不能升當然理解，但是給人臉色看是什麼意思這麼大的酒店
後來那個小姐姐讓那個男的好好弄了，特別和善祝我們入住愉快
枕頭上有黑印子 屋頂淋浴頭是壞的（就是完全洗不了衹能用小噴頭洗）

提前打電話説了要個高點的房間，結果還是給了整個房型裏相對低的房間，前台也是內種你愛住不住，我們這一房難求的態度吧。
想着就住一晚，和氣生財少較勁，就也同意了，結果一打開房間，我驚呆了，氣味像是混合著一股煙草味兒，讓人刺鼻，房間收拾的也不乾淨，雖然就是説2014年裝修的，應該也不至於吧🤔
找了服務生看怎麼收拾一下，也説收拾不了，最後還是把值班經理找來了，等了很久吧也，除了經理的態度還不錯，剩下所有接觸到的服務態度都很差，經理進屋看完之後，給換了一間房，雖然房型一樣，但是高了也乾淨了，湊合了一晚，第二天火速退房了。

性價比：不到500訂到奢牌五星，而且室內根本也不舊，看不出是14年的，就在海河邊、市中心，超級滿意！！
設施：設施齊備，配的各種個人用品也很齊全，房間很大很舒服，窗外可以完全俯瞰海河，藍天下超級美，浴缸很舒服！！建議下次可以再送個浴缸套就更好了！！
衞生：總體都挺好的，衹發現了一片垃圾，但是還是非常滿意的
服務：很有禮貌，入住退房都很快，就是衣服換洗服務的姐姐太熱情了哈哈哈哈哈，如果不迴應我覺得最好就不用直接進來了吧，也給客人更多安全感
環境：從大堂審美就很好，房間也是超大超寬敞，大窗户視野好。

下次還會再選這裏的！！！感謝你們，希望保持喔

衞生：整體的服務還是一如既往的好。房間乾淨整潔舒適温馨，設施齊備，住起來非常舒服。

環境：酒店的位置非常好，遠眺天津之眼，俯瞰海河碧波，與古文化街咫尺之遙，距離西北角早市也比較近，並且周圍好吃的飯店也特別多。

設施：酒店還提供了機器人送餐服務，這對於我和朋友這種社恐+宅女來説是大大的加分項。

服務：點名感謝大堂經理杜經理！在我入住期間給我提供了特別周到完善的服務，給予我非常多的幫助，讓我再一次體驗到了“賓至如歸”。同時還有5月29日上午前台戴眼鏡的小姐姐，雖然衹是辦理了一個退房業務，接觸雖短暫卻有如沐春風之感（就是好可惜沒有看清她的名字）。

總之，強烈安利天津泛太平洋酒店（´∀｀）σ

説一下大家最關心的居住體驗：我們訂的是家庭房，正好在海河對面！晚上可以清晰的欣賞天津的海河夜景！房間內的設施都比較中規中矩，給人一種舒服的感覺！還有一個大浴缸，多年不泡澡的我，也終於體驗了一把！哈哈哈！那叫一個舒服！
再聊一下娛樂設施：這就得感謝游泳館的小張，他們酒店4層是健身➕游泳的地方，估計都出去玩了，健身房和游泳館幾乎沒什麼人，體驗了一把vip的感覺！水温也非常的合適！感覺特別爽
最後説一下餐飲：酒店內部有自助餐，菜品種類特別的多，因為白天中午晚上我們都出去玩，衹吃了早餐，光早餐的種類我看了一下，最少就得小100種吧！還有三文魚，你受得了麼！
我們走的當天早上還下了雨，賈經理，杜經理，親自幫我們把行李送上了車！我們的寶寶比較小，賈經理還送了一個可愛的毛絨玩具！總得來説，居住體驗非常的不錯，這個價位，性價比非常的高了！推薦大家入住體驗

接下去就是要談酒店的問題所在。首先到達和最後離開時，都沒有任何人幫忙提行禮，這是我住的唯一一家從頭到尾沒有幫忙提行禮的五星級酒店，入住的6天裏唯一有的服務大概也是非常偶爾的能碰到幫忙開個車門吧。
其次，前台接待也是酒店門面，第一印象所在，很不幸的是我也沒碰到什麼服務熱情的前台，辦理入住的前台也就這樣冷冰冰。
最後，很不幸的是酒店入住期間遇到外賣被陌生人所拿，索性金額不大，沒有繼續深究，但酒店也的確隱藏着風險，我住的其他酒店外賣都是由機器人送到門口，根本就不會出現有外賣會被別人拿走的事情，所以酒店的措施上面給顧客增加了風險。雖然酒店給了一點補救，但酒店本身其實也是有責任的，及早出台措施，杜絕根本吧。
最後還是非常感謝清潔小哥，雖然我不知您的名字，但謝謝您給天津這座城市添上一筆温暖專業的色彩在我們心上。

*晚上點了好幾份外賣打電話前台讓機器人一起送上來省的分開好幾趟，沒想到前台怕我們等太久直接親自送上來了。
*早餐想喝冰美式，但自己沒找到冰塊就沒打咖啡，吃的過程中有一位男性工作人員過來詢問還需要啥，幫打了一杯冰美式੭ᐕ）੭*⁾⁾。
*到酒店之後發現酒店安排了演唱會接送的大巴，省的演唱會結束自己回來不方便，跟車的小哥個子很高一下子就找到大巴了哈哈，而且小哥很精神，超級治癒，頭一天十一點多還跟車呢，結果第二天早上六點多我們退房走的時候在門口看到了小哥精神十足地幫我們來開車門了（⁎⁍̴̛ᴗ⁍̴̛⁎）沒來得及問小哥什麼名字，但是他超棒，心情都變好了。
下次來天津還住這家～～～超級推薦！

還有的就是主辦方給的門票雖然是連號票，但**中間隔着一個台階的連號票（紅圈為我老婆的位置），你這鬧着玩呢？我和老婆一起去的。能否用點心啊？

地理位置不錯，離天津站很近，出門散步去海河也方便，離古文化街也超近，對面就有大福來，買耳朵眼炸糕也很方便。
總體好評。

早餐：早餐種類豐富，中餐、西餐都有，在杜小姐介紹下餐廳師傅做的煎餅果子特別好吃，具有天津特色，很酥脆~超級值得推薦。

定的房間帶着行政酒廊歡樂時光，5:30以後有簡餐，在29層，人比較少，景色比較漂亮，拍照打卡的好地方❤️

特別推薦：行政套房，在房間中能看到天津之眼，夜景無敵美噠。

However，酒店硬件一般，衞生間有漏水，地毯的顏色看起來有點臟臟的，價格上有體現這點。

服務：辦理入住出示攜程升房權益，服務員陰陽怪氣告訴我今天滿房不能升房，我告訴她，此時此刻攜程上還有房間在售，你這是欺騙顧客，給你差評。最後她磨嘰半天回覆我，升房可以但需要等一小時。

1、酒店位置好：
     在海河邊，近金鋼橋、天津之眼！
     出酒店，沿解放廣場，走兩分鐘，過大馬路就是古文化街！
     交通方便，離鼓樓、西北角，車程10分鐘！
2、酒店客房服務：
      必須點贊👍每天都有新鮮水果、提出的要求儘可能滿足！
      曬傷後，及時送冰塊、毛巾大量提供！
3、酒店泳池；雖然不大，服務周到，人少的時候，遊得很舒服！

我們是禮拜五下午5點左右到的酒店，訂的是城市景觀大床房，跟前台漂亮小姐姐問了一下可不可以升級房型的要求，本來想用攜程的積分兑換，但是小姐姐直接免費給升級到行政樓層去了，而且還提供了行政樓層的下午茶，非常感謝🙏小朋友高興壞了🎉
客房服務員也非常有心，手寫了一封信而且還給小朋友準備了一個小小的禮品，包括每次有需要都會第一時間處理，非常的貼心.
總之這一次的酒店🏨選擇非常明確，小朋友在離開的時候非常的不捨得，一直在説下次還要住在泛太平洋大酒店😂，我相信以後來天津它是我們唯一的首選👈🎊

提個小意見，2009房間的服務指南有的頁面臟了，希望能更換，大窗户外面那層遮光簾不好往下拉了。2016房間的空調製冷不太好，面盆下水的那個蓋子不好打開。晚上打電話給服務中心反映問題，但是無人接聽。
其餘都很好，很喜歡天津泛太，以後來天津就住這裏了！

酒店地理位置確實不錯，離天津之眼，古文化街，還有碼頭都比較近。步行距離合適。
酒店自帶停車場，比較大。
周邊吃飯的話好像不多，有個燕春樓，好像等位，天津菜葉不太感興趣，沒體驗，其他特快餐貌似不多。
大堂經理給了孩子入住禮物，孩子很開心，感謝。要的客房加被子很快就送到了，服務 ok

不過服務真的是1等1的好：a.第二天給打掃房間居然把我們衣服都給疊好擺好；充電線都摺好規整好。
b.定的連住兩天，每天一個早餐的套餐，第一早去西北角，酒店早餐沒用，找的大堂經理直接給調到第二早給兩個早餐了。
總體還是很不錯的 值得再次入住。

洗澡的地方沒有門，就一個浴簾，浴簾還不到底，地上沒擋水條，地面內外無落差，洗澡水弄的廁所到處都是，有小朋友的話真心滑，不安全。
毛巾第一天很好，第二天是破的，但是我表示理解，畢竟連續四天滿房，可能是真沒毛巾了。
洗手枱特別矮，6歲小童輕鬆使用，這個應該不算親子酒店，不明白為什麼那麼矮。
卧室內佈局不合理，導致冰箱，水壺都沒地方放，擱在高處。
其他都還是很不錯的，床及床品舒服，早餐也不錯。早餐的服務員特別勤快，人很多的時候運作的很好

首先我是因為傑倫演唱會訂的套票，一開始覺得有些“怨種”，後來覺得來這個酒店很值。
先表揚為整個傑倫演唱會服務的前台，一開始我訂單生成的是8號演唱會，7號入住（系統問題），後來我要求協調8號入住，一開始平台和酒店都不同意，但幾次溝通，把所有出現系統錯亂問題的顧客全部調節好了。效率很高！

再詳細説酒店情況，整個服務態度特別好，周到，為演唱會提供接送車。

衞生，設施，非常好，水温超級贊。
環境，外部環境很棒，鄰海河，出門走幾步就可以到獅子林橋。

總之如果有外地朋友來津，我一定會推薦這裏。整個房間很通透，明亮，整潔。服務，設施，位置都特別滿意！

三點到，房間還沒有，要等到4點半，在此之前，也上不去行政酒廊～
房間裏設施中規中矩吧，窗簾要手動拉上去～沒有身體乳，衹能打客房電話才給送。
裏面的環境一般般吧，衞生及格。但是頂樓的樓梯口，很多外賣垃圾，第二天早上10點半都沒人收。
早餐種類不多，行政酒廊晚上就一個服務人員，要負責打掃、check名單、加菜，質量自行想象

1、前台免費升級了河景客房。
2、客房面積足夠大，乾濕分離的衞生間有浴缸。
3、出門左轉五分鐘步行就到古街景點（免費）。
4、周邊有幾家天津本地菜館不錯。
再説差的：
1、600多間夜的價格，五星的評級，客房用水竟然是冰露冰露冰露，你但凡用超過8毛錢的農夫山泉或者怡寶我都不説什麼。
2、忘記看哪年開業的了，電視還是32寸的，可現在已經是2023年了呀。
3、除了牙刷其餘的一次性用品完全沒有，還好我是男的，不需要浴帽木梳潤膚乳等。
最後總結：整體中規中矩，大部分客人好像都是來參加會議，商務出行較多。個人旅行不建議。

我想泛太平洋屬於後者
因為聽演唱會結束後會比較晚check in，所以下午3點提前打電話給酒店客服，説明瞭入住較晚請預留安靜房間，客服很禮貌的説備註了。
晚上快12點到達酒店辦check in，一位穿白色制服的前台工作人員，態度巨冷漠，我説在停車場沒有找到停車位，是不是下地庫？她跟我説讓我找保安！我要是看到保安我還問你？！這時，旁邊台的黑色制服姑娘，很熱情的從櫃枱走出來，幫忙找車位！
白色制服特別不懶煩的跟我説，是不是要加早餐？我説對，並且我已經提前告知過了。白色制服：你現在需要把80元早餐付了，我説可以呀，但是為什別的酒店都可以check out時再付，你們不行？白色制服翻着白眼説：你現在付是80元，明天退房再付就是120元！（並沒説明原因，我致電客服時也沒有任何提示！）實在懶得跟這個前台説話了，我付完錢，問早餐是幾點？回：6：30-10：00。我説，房間我之前備註了，是不是按我備註安排的。白色制服説：是！
我們拿了房卡上樓，房間是走廊左手第一間（我備註過説不要第一間），空調聲巨響嗡嗡嗡一晚上，樓下正對一個高架橋，汽車噪音，要不是大晚上懶得折騰，真的是一晚上沒睡好！房間床頭桌上還有污漬！
唯一可以給好評的是餐廳的工作人員都很熱情主動，還有幫忙泊車的姑娘！

最想説的是服務，服務太差了！
我們住了三天二夜，見到了各種服務員，一個比一個差，完全不敢想你在住一家五星酒店。
1. 辦理checkin時，前台全程一邊打電話，一邊辦入住，我都分不清她到底是在和我説話還是和電話那邊。不便接電話邊服務，難道不是前台的基本素質？
全程不溝通房間號，餐廳樓層，早餐時間等訊息。辦完入住，給房卡，讓自己看。
2.行政酒廊：我們的房間附帶行政酒廊，剛好在電梯遇到另外一家一起去行政酒廊，我們一行7、8人同時進，服務員瞪大了眼睛，問哪個房間，你們這麼多人住一間嗎？場面十分尷尬！
3.第二天早餐，和一個**服務員要冰，全程臭着臉，我明明伸手去接裝好冰的杯子，他啪一下放在枱子上，頭也不回就走了。怎麼，吃個飯還得看你臉色？！
4.去泳池，在前台，服務員説這個時間人很多，你自己看。我説我看不見，他説你看牆上的登記紙，沒讓你看泳池！吶尼？你是誰？我瞬間角色混亂了，以為是高中時的大隊輔導員活過來了！
5.在停車場，我問服務員哪裡有車位，他説自己進去找。
再説説早餐：除了煎餅和豆腐腦，其他都很一般！最讓人無法接受的是，行政酒廊下午茶很多餐食和早餐的菜是一樣的，所以，下午茶是早餐的剩飯？早餐完全不值，建議大家去外面吃煎餅，鍋巴菜！

服務差到令人髮指！我們住的套房，1400多一晚，完全不值！

msg:預訂的兩間河景房 説是超售了 給升級了行政房  但是行政房感覺還沒河景房好呢 地方小 還是把角的房間 送的餐還不如不送 一行4大4小光等吃的等了一個多小時  孩子餓的衹能吃蝦片  體驗感太差了  不過還是要表揚下行政區的小王  服務很到位 算是這次入住最好的事情

msg:訂房時備註了最好兩間房同一層，因為帶着孩子長者出遊比較方便照顧，結果入住當天一個14、一個23層，每次拿取東西都特別不方便總要下到一層匯合。我們住萬豪的時候人家都會貼心的給兩張房卡關聯，直接就能乘坐電梯……此外房間隔音特別不好，所謂的河景房真的景色很一般！晚上12點後依然能聽到外面傳來的歌聲、樓上掉東西聲以及隔壁的電視聲……早餐廳和前台服務人員比較熱情，眼裡有活兒，就是早餐水準一般，很多食材不像五星酒店。
