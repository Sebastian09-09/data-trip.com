smell nice in the corridor but in room even though it is a non smoking room but still smell a bit of smoke and might have a little cleaning issue on the floor.
the hotel provides a lot of bottle of water 

the location is fine can walk to the shopping street very easily but first we dont know but find out later that its very close

Cons: 1. Seems like they turn off the central air conditioning around 1am onwards. Room gets warm around that time and i also heard from another guest complaining about the same thing. 2. Wifi is not working for the 7 nights we spent there.

The location is excellent and it is very convenient to eat near Guijie Street! It‚Äôs just that the temperature is too low, so sometimes I‚Äôm too lazy to go out and order takeout. The takeout is left out in the open air (probably a continuation of the measures taken during the epidemic). With the low temperature of about minus ten degrees, the food freezes! There are no heating facilities such as microwaves in the hotel, but fortunately the restaurant manager found a way to heat it up! Thank him here!

The facilities in the room are also good. It is quite comfortable to stay. There is a humidifier in the room, so children in the south don‚Äôt feel it is particularly dry. The hotel provides two meals. Since the restaurant is relatively small, it only entertains guests staying in the hotel, so it is not crowded. You can also watch the news while eating breakfast, which is quite good.
When we stayed in the hotel, there was occasional noise from the decoration because the first floor was being renovated, but it was relatively quiet when we rested at night.
Not far away, there is Nanluoguxiang, and next to it is Lama Temple. The location is quite nice and close to the subway.
The facilities in the room are relatively good, and the bedding is also relatively clean and hygienic.

The Dongfangmao Hotel has a large hotel, spacious and comfortable rooms, and a rich breakfast variety. It is very close to Nanluoguxiang and Yonghegong Temple. The hotel is not in a small alley, but faces the main street. The transportation is convenient. Take bus No. 141 and 135 and get off at Jiaodaokou South Station. It only takes 3 or 4 minutes to walk. Metro Line 7 Also convenient. What's more important is that the hotel service staff are of high quality, patient and meticulous. I will stay at Dongfangmao Hotel next time I come to Beijing.

The size was half smaller. They also said that the list they received was like this. I waited until I went to the front desk to show them my reservation record before opening it again. correct room. Not to mention in the room, from the hotel lobby to the room, there is a smell of broth. The sofa in the room looks like tattered, the leather has been worn and faded and cracked, and the carpet is also faded and dirty. I don‚Äôt know how many dirty things are hidden, all the furniture is severely worn and looks like heirlooms, the bathroom and bathroom glass doors are fogged due to old water stains, the basin table is also various old stains, and the paper tube next to the toilet is still flipped The kind of children (who knows what has been stained on it, it's disgusting), even if the ground is wiped clean, it is as if it is covered with oil, so I dare not step on it, and the sliding door is full of fingerprints. There are also offset marks left by scotch tape on the walls. My child started sneezing as soon as he entered the room, which shows how dirty the air is. I asked the front desk if all your rooms are so old, and I replied that this hotel was built in nine years. But your price is not the price of 1990s, okay? The breakfast restaurant mainly serves vegetarian dishes, vegetarian cold dishes, and vegetarian hot dishes. The only meat dishes are duck gizzards and stewed chicken nuggets. There are people who turn on the hands-free to make video calls during meals, so one can imagine the grade.
Too many times, absolutely not recommended! Empty words have nothing to prove with pictures!

The managers of the hotel seemed to be the same old people, basically unchanged. It was already past 12:30 noon. The front desk manager arranged for a free upgrade to a suite. I was a VIP of Grand Mercure before, so I would arrange a suite for me. It was very kind to check in again. From the airport, take the express train directly to Beixinqiao, Exit A. When you come out, you will find Guijie Street, and the Lama Temple is not far away. It is very close to Nanluo Houhai. The geographical location is unique! Although the room facilities are old, but still very comfortable. For this price, this location is a good choice. Recommended for business trips!

Let me tell you about the good things: 1. The hotel staff, whether it is the front desk or the service center, the food and beverage depar**ent are very enthusiastic. The front desk helped to upgrade the twin room to a deluxe twin room, and later upgraded it to a suite, bringing more than 1.2 meters Children, free children's breakfast, free afternoon tea for three people. 2. The breakfast in the restaurant is very rich. If you don‚Äôt have time to eat it, you can ask the staff to help you pack it and take it out. The staff will ask if the breakfast is delicious, which is very considerate. 3. The size of the room is very large, about 4-50 square meters. The big bed is very comfortable, clean and comfortable. 4. The service staff cleans the place very well every day. It feels a little hot at night, but the customer service even resisted the air conditioner, which is very powerful. 5. The hotel sent snacks and drinks in the mini bar, and welcome fruit every day. 6. The children gave toothpaste and toothbrush and children's slippers, and also thoughtfully gave small gifts. 7. Close to Beixinqiao Subway Station, 5-6 minutes walk, surrounded by delicious shops, convenient to go anywhere.
Let me talk about some small problems: 1. The TV in the deluxe room is not on the right bed, nor is it facing the sofa, which is strange. 2. The door of the shower room is not closed tightly, and water will leak out when taking a shower. 3. There is no basket for dirty bath towels in the bathroom. 4. There is no outlet for a hair dryer in the bathroom. 5. The TV is relatively small, the facilities need to be upgraded, and the sofa is a bit old. 6. The switch design is too complicated, and I don't really understand it after staying for four nights. 7. The placemat in the restaurant is not replaced after one customer uses it up, just wipe it off for the next customer to use. 8. No swimming pool gym.
I stayed for four nights in a row, and overall I am very satisfied with the hotel. The staff of the hotel very much hope to make the hotel a good one. They are very concerned about the feelings of the guests. The room is big enough and the bed is comfortable enough. It is far from the subway station It is also close, convenient to travel, recommended üòÅüòÅ

msg:If you can accept the lack of air conditioning, you can live there. There is no wind, whether it is cold air or hot air. The maintenance man pointed at the air inlet and said loudly, "Isn't it windy? Didn't you hear it? It was so loud. Didn't you hear it? Yes, we don't have central air conditioning in the countryside." I've seen it before. It has everything you need for breakfast. There weren't many vegetables at 9.15. The snacks in the steamer were really unpalatable. Half a cup of milk was gone when I poured it out, and it wasn't fresh milk. It means there was still nothing after ten minutes. I can't afford to live there. Just live

msg:I have been to Beijing many times and stayed in many hotels. The last time I came to Beijing before the epidemic was in May 2019. At that time, I stayed in this hotel called Grand Mercure Beijing Oriental. Because I had a very good impression of this hotel at the time, I directly chose this hotel when I came to Beijing for the first time after the epidemic. But the name has changed, and a lot of things have changed.
        As soon as I entered the room, I found that the floor tiles in the entrance, especially the bathroom, were very dirty. I wanted to call the front desk to ask for a room change, but found that the phone was broken, so I had to drag the suitcase back to the lobby. After changing our room, I was afraid that there would be another problem with the room. I didn't want to go up and down again, so I hoped that a staff member would accompany us up there. A male staff member agreed to accompany us up there. But this hotel really has no sense of service. He went up with us two girls and never thought about helping us drag our suitcases along the way, haha.
      After moving to another room, the floor tiles still had the same problem. He said it was not dirty, but scratches. We're too lazy to change it anymore, so let's leave it at that. Later, when I took a closer look, I saw that there were cracks on the table and two tiles on the wall were missing. I was very busy in Beijing and didn‚Äôt have the habit of commenting, so I forgot to take photos. I don‚Äôt know what happened to this hotel in the past few years. My friend speculated whether it was used as a quarantine hotel during the epidemic. Anyway, it‚Äôs not worthy of the price.
      At one or two o'clock in the middle of the second night, there was a man with a psychotic disorder yelling on the street downstairs. His voice was so loud that he woke him up immediately. It lasted for a long time. I don't know why the hotel didn't stop him.
     The only advantage of the hotel is its location. It is very close to Guijie Street, Yonghe Temple, and Nanluogu Lane and can be reached on foot.

msg:I ate steel wire *****s in the cake of the hotel buffet breakfast. It is the steel wire ball that is often used in the kitchen to wash the pan. It is incredible that it appears in the cake. In the market, this kind of star-rated hotel actually made such a low-level mistake. After that, no relevant person in charge or hotel manager gave a reply. Because this happened on the first day of my trip, I immediately decided to check out. Continue to live. I asked the front desk when I checked out, but the front desk only said they knew but did not inform the person in charge of the kitchen. The manager explained that he would give me an answer later, and added WeChat with her private number. Attached is the attached picture. You can see how this manager is. Reply to me, at that time you reasoned with them, but they found reasons for themselves and returned to the customers. The wise man sees the wisdom. When you consider staying in this hotel for breakfast in the future, please pay attention to safety.

5. I went out and did not tidy up my belongings, so I turned on Do Not Disturb, but I still came to clean. As a result, the facial cleanser and oin**ent on the table were cleaned up, and I forgot to put the comb.
I only talk about what happened during the stay and my own feelings. The hotel said to compensate me for the lost things, but when I asked if the cleaning salary should be deducted, he didn't say anything. So I didn't accept compensation.

Breakfast always starts at 7 o'clock, and it is also because there are candidates checking in, so it is early to 6:30, which is still very good. But the variety is pitiful, there is no service, the breakfast sausage is gone and cannot be replenished in time, the big sister who cooks the noodles and fried eggs has no expression during the whole process, asking what is the same as not hearing itüòì.

At 9 am on the first day and 8 am on the second day, the waiter would come in to clean the room regardless of swiping open the door, and even swiped the room directly to enter. The next day, in addition to the forced entry at 8 o'clock, the waiter knocked on the door again at 9 o'clock and did not explain anything clearly. After 9 o'clock, he called again and asked if one of us had checked out, but we did not check out , The service management of the hotel can be described as chaos. I gave it 1 star because there is a little brother at the front desk of the hotel who is very nice. When I went downstairs to get takeout, the little brother led me to Ximen to find the takeaway. When I checked out, the little brother also took the initiative to find us who were queuing up to check out, and opened it in time. The new lane handles checkout quickly. thanks brother

But the hotel itself has many problems. The first is that the hotel is no longer Grand Mercure, and it has not changed its name on Ctrip. The second is that it has become a home-like hotel with very few staff. The breakfast is Chinese or Western, just a plate of food. Although it's enough for me, it still feels a little bit pricey. Third, the facilities are really poor, the sound insulation of the door is not good, the tray is moldy, and there are other problems.
But the service really made up for these problems, and once again praised the two staff at the front desk~

Second, it is quiet in the middle of the noise. But the shortcomings are also obvious. The facilities in the house are relatively old and do not match the level. Second, there is a phenomenon of stains on the towels. The room service will be replaced in time, but I hope it will not be encountered again.

msg:The location of the hotel is very good, the facilities are well maintained and not very old, the attitude of the front desk staff is very good and efficient, and they even upgraded me to a suite~
However, there are actually many small problems in the hotel. First of all, the hot water was not hot during the two nights I stayed in. The switch was turned to the hottest and it was only warm water. I hope it is the problem of individual rooms... Secondly, there were only two small bottles in the room when I checked in. Mineral water, this is definitely not enough. The next day I called the housekeeping depar**ent to ask for a few bottles of water. The staff said they would send it to me right away, but I waited for half an hour but didn't...
Another point I don't quite understand. The suite I live in is obviously a 1.8-meter bed from the back of the bed in the bedroom, but it is actually a 1.5-meter bed. This is really my hotel of this level. The first time I encountered a room with a big bed with a 1.5-meter bed...
The price of the hotel is quite competitive. The price of 500 to 600 yuan in the core area of Beixinqiao is really not expensive, but I hope the hotel will pay more attention to the details of services and facilities. Otherwise, a new hotel with a similar price will be a better choice.

The fly in the oin**ent, the hotel‚Äôs warm reminder is not recommended to drink the tap water in the room directly, but only two small bottles of 300ml mineral water are provided every day, which is better than nothing. To catch the rain, borrow an umbrella from the hotel and pay a deposit of 100 yuan separately. The procedure is not simple enough. I personally think that a deposit of 500 yuan has been paid when checking in and the room fee has been paid in full. In rainy days, guests should provide umbrella services free of charge.
