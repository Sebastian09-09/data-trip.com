Huge location, great rooms with their own hot springs, local and international staff, good food and drink, great swimming pools (indoor and outdoor) and sauna, and a lovely (yet pricy) spa. The only thing I disliked was them not willing to bring the breakfast I paid for to my room, but apparently this is policy so as to boost the room service menu. Other than this, it was a memorable and relaxing experience.

msg:Huge hotel and lots of room to be chosen. Room is big, clean and tidy. Hotel arranged personal service manager to coordinate with during stays. Request being served at nice and fast manner which is highly appreciated. Lots of activities for kids. Just some activities need to be charged additionally and I will suggest hotel can offer discount for guests who stay in hotel.

Plenty of choice of breakfast but when getting crazy when lots of guest going to have breakfast at the same time. Lack of food. Suggest hotel can assign some time slot for guests so divide guests into groups to avoid having breakfast at the same time.

Due to hotel is large, lifts are provided at one side only. If i stay in the room far from the lift while I am going to the location downstairs just behind my room, I need to walk 10 mins to the lift and then another 10 mins to the location where i need to go.Highly suggest hotel can newly build some lifts in the other side of the building so guest (especially elderly need not walk long way).

msg:I came here to play during the May Day holiday. I didn't choose a crowded tourist attraction. I wanted to try a hot spring resort hotel. I chose it because I saw that the hotel also had a children's playground. Shenzhen is not far away, and there was no traffic jam on the first day of the holiday. The hotel can only be checked in after 3 o'clock, and it was just right when I arrived at 3 o'clock. The room I chose is in the main building. It takes only two or three minutes to walk to the hot spring ‚ô®Ô∏è bathing pool, or you can take a small battery car to connect, which is also convenient. I saw that there is also a heated swimming pool in the main building, but I didn't have time to check it out.
Environment# The room is quite large. I chose a room with a bathtub and a balcony. There are also welcome fruits, which is quite thoughtful~ There are some drinks in the refrigerator, and there are small coffees, but I don't know how to use them üòÇ The sound insulation is so-so, and I can hear the sound of passers-by. I took my luggage down early the next day, and the guest room asked if I had checked out. I said that there were still people in the room who hadn't checked out, but they knocked on the door after a while. Because it was not yet twelve o'clock, this was a bit strange.

#Hot Spring
The hot spring pool is in the same place as the children's water park, and there is also a large swimming pool. There were a lot of people on May Day, but you can still find a place to soak, big and small, and there is a service desk that provides warm water, ginger tea, and towels~
#breakfast The next day, there was a queue for the buffet breakfast at 9 o'clock. There might be too many people. The restaurant is quite large. The type of breakfast is okay, the freshly cooked soup noodles are not bad, but you have to queue for a whileüòÇ
The children's playground in the hotel is quite large, and you need to enter the ticket, 178 for one large and one small. It is suitable for letting off steam~ There is also a rest area for parents + monitoring.
In general, it is not bad~ It is suitable for taking the family on a short vacation.

1. The flow of people on June 6 was a bit large, but the hotel service was generally good.
2. Especially the several staff members serving in the lobby front office, He Shijun, the lobby manager and the front desk reception service were particularly warm and thoughtful
3. It takes 30-40 minutes to drive from Shenzhen, which is quite convenient.
4. There were almost no bath towels in the hot spring area last time, but this time the replenishment was very timely, and the waiter was also very polite. Compared with the last time, it was a big improvement.
5. The bedside tables in the guest rooms are specially anti-collision treated to prevent children from getting hurt.

There are five buildings in the water area, a long row, you can swim all the way to the hot spring area.
Breakfast was eaten in the fifth building, the content was average, there were still many varieties, but not exquisite enough. For a resort hotel, you can imagine that there are a lot of people, children everywhere, and it is a mess. It would be good to have breakfast. The fried eggs are very good.
The front desk is very organized for checking in and out, many people help, and the attitude is generally good. After all, working overtime is also very tiring.

When checking in, Manager Ren Zhichen enthusiastically introduced the anniversary activities, and discounts were available for purchasing packages, activities, and meals. Manager Ren also took the initiative to ask us to contact us via WeChat. Any problems with the room were quickly solved. He was also happy to answer other travel and transportation issues. He really deserves to be praised.
The hotel is very large. Although it has been open for a long time, it is well maintained, especially the hot spring and water world facilities, which are very safe for children to play. The only problem is to do a good job of repelling mosquitoes. There are mosquito repellent sprays at the service points in the venue for tourists to use.
There are special events on Mother's Day, so I will go there again next time to have fun.

Facilities: There are many activities to experience and play in the hotel. It is not boring to stay for three days and two nights
Service: Aunt Lu who is in charge of the villa is really good. She will try her best to meet our needs, and will explain patiently if she can't meet them. Although the needs are not met, as a guest staying in the hotel, I feel very comfortable and easy to accept because of the explanation of Manager Lu.
Service: From the beginning of check-in, all the docking services provided by Lisa to us are very smooth, from guest rooms, catering, express delivery, ** take-out are all taken care of very well.
If the holiday allows, I believe we will choose Sanzheng Banshan next time

We decided to use the cheapest way to start the journey from Shenzhen Luohu Port Line 1, change at the Convention and Exhibition Center and take the bus to Songyuanxia Station, then take the M188 bus to Dongguan South Station and call a taxi. It took two hours to get to the hotel.
The staff at the front desk were courteous and prepared a non-smoking room for us. The location is in the middle of the main building. There are green trees outside and birds chirping from time to time. It is very healing for the soul.
Went for a walk to the mid-level hot springs, but half of the bathhouses were closed. I personally like the European-style a**osphere. When I go to the goddess statue at the end, there are underground hot stones to warm up, and Luo Han Guo tea is available everywhere.
No need to ask for dinner, the Han Palace Chinese Restaurant on the third floor offers a set meal for two at $198, which is a great value. The pickled fish is worth a thumbs up!
After having a rich breakfast buffet the next day, we walked to the Grand Bell Lake for a stroll, looking at the lake view and feeling refreshed. Since my application for late check-out was successful, I went to the first floor to soak in the hot springs and go home with a comfortable body and mind.

First of all, I want to say that the environment of Sanzheng Banshan Hot Spring Hotel is very beautiful. The hotel is located between mountains and surrounded by lush trees, making it feel very cozy. In addition, the hotel's facilities are also very complete, with high-quality hygiene and maintenance maintained in both guest rooms and public areas.

In terms of service, the hotel staff are very welcoming and professional. They are always smiling and willing to help with any problem. Especially during the check-in and check-out process, their service made me feel very convenient and comfortable.

The spa facilities of the hotel are my favorite part. The water quality of the hot spring is very good, clear and transparent, and it makes people feel very relaxed when soaking in it. In addition, the hotel also provides a variety of hot spring pools to meet the needs of different people.

Overall, I rate Sanzheng Banshan Hot Spring Hotel very highly. It not only provides comfortable accommodation, but also has excellent services and beautiful natural scenery. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to relax on vacation.

Of course, if the hotel can improve in providing more entertainment facilities, I believe it will become a more perfect resort. However, this does not affect my overall favorable opinion of the hotel.

In fact, there is a spa center on the first floor of the main building, which has an indoor swimming pool and several hot spring pools. It is also very good and free for residents.

Moreover, for two adults with a child, the child will be charged an additional fee of more than 100 yuan, which does not feel very reasonable.

There are many pools in the hot spring area, and I basically soaked in every pool. The most satisfying thing is to do the steaming, which is very comfortable after the steaming.

The hotel covers a large area, surrounded by mountains and rivers, and has beautiful scenery. You can go boating on the lake and walk along the lake. Looking out from the balcony of the lake view room in the early morning, the mountain and lake are covered with a layer of mist, which is particularly beautiful.

The hot spring area is very large and has several areas designed in different styles. Different from some old hot spring hotels in Qingyuan with outdated facilities, the hardware here is well maintained. Along the steps, among the green trees are bathing pools of different sizes and functions. I saw maintenance signs next to some pools, and staff were draining and refilling the water. I still feel relatively reassured.

There is a huge playground here. The little sister played in the children's playground inside until she refused to leave, while the brothers played video games and doll machines (there were so many doll machines). Adults can find a place by themselves to drink tea and chat.

Look at the hotel map to see the waterfront area, go-kart park, and other facilities. But our stay this time was too short, and we will definitely come back next time!

The disadvantage is that there are many people. When the hotel is full on weekends and holidays, the hot spring experience is not likely to be very good, and the catering is also the same.

The hotel is next to the Dazhong Lake, surrounded by mountains and rivers, with great greenery and pleasant air! The staff are all professional, dedicated and courteous.
The breakfast is rich and tasty.
It is within walking distance to Xiyue Tangjiagang, which is very convenient for eating Cantonese food.

The front desk upgraded the room to a larger room for free, and the service is also very attentive. There are many people going to the hotel during holidays, and the buffet breakfast has many types of food. It's all right, but the taste is normal. There are a lot of people. If you go late, you may have to wait for a table. It's still very enjoyable to take a private bath in the room. Overall, the hotel is worthy of the room price and star rating. If you want to find a hotel that is close to you and can take a bath in the cold winter is a good choice

When we checked in, Xiao Zheng at the front desk was very attentive and even changed us to a room that could connect to the room next door. Since we are a family of 5, it is much more convenient for the two rooms to be interconnected.

In other aspects, I felt that the waiters were very polite and enthusiastic, and the hotel was grand. The only thing that needs improvement is the lack of elevators. Because there are many rooms, we live a little far from the elevators, so we have to walk for a while. Overall, this hotel is very good, especially in this season.

I specially booked a parent-child room, but I didn't expect that it was just a mattress on the floor and a tent set up casually, and the children didn't want to sleep at night! Moreover, the facilities in the house are old. In a 5-star hotel, there is no sofa or tea table in the room. Once you enter the room, you can only sit on the bed! The toiletries are very simple, just like the standard of a hotel. The children's water park is also very simple with just a few swimming pools, nothing special! The hot spring pool is also a water park. There are only about 10 pools which are relatively ordinary. The planet park is not bad, but the ticket setting is very strange. Adult tickets cannot be used by children. Even if adults do not enter, children have to pay for the tickets. All in all, this hotel is not worth the price! The experience is similar to that of a fast hotel.

The hotel is not very new, it should have been renovated, and the room looks okay! Maybe there were more than 11 people, so everyone was running late for the morning buffet, which made me feel a bit overwhelmed! Buffets are all the same as usual!

You can enjoy a comfortable holiday
This trip is 3 days and 2 days, and the 3 children feel that they can't play enough‚ò∫Ô∏è
There are many facilities here, hot springs, massage, water world, indoor and outdoor swimming pools
There is also an indoor children's playground to play with the planet, and the children are reluctant to leave after playing
The waiters here are very nice and polite.
Special thanks to this caring waiter, Ms. Wu Shuwei
Prepare a beautiful birthday cake for us, adding color to our journey
Ms. Wu is very careful in her work. She even took out the check-out certificate for us when we checked out on the third day, so that we can still go to the hot spring area after checking out!
Really worth recommending to friends

We stayed at Tangxia Sanzheng Banshan Hot Spring Hotel for the first time, for three days and two nights. On the first night, we booked a room with a buffet dinner. Remember to call to make a reservation, because this place is really very popular and there are no reservations There are really no seats, the buffet is very rich, cold dishes, hot dishes and desserts, even red and white wine and beer are free to drink. This is the first time I have eaten spicy crayfish. It tastes so good. Instantly grilled prawns, steamed scallops and other seafood are very fresh and good Delicious, many waiters, good service, we two adults and two children are very satisfied

The room is large, clean and hygienic, and the air conditioner is very good. We live in a water viewing room. As soon as you walk down, you will find the swimming pool. If you go down the slide, you will find the water park. It is very convenient. You can jump into the hot spring after playing in the cool water Soaking, very comfortable, there are many lifeguards and staff, and they are very responsible

On the second night, we ordered **takeaway, which was placed in a takeout cabinet, which can be opened first by scanning the QR code. I took the battery car to go out, and the staff waited for me to pick it up before driving me back to the room, very considerate

On the third day, after we checked out, we went to Fun Planet to play. This •öÉ is suitable for children under the age of ten. My two elementary school chickens had a great time.

Thanks again to all the waiters and staff, especially the lobby manager Abby, thank you for your hard work

The western restaurant in the main building serves breakfast, lunch and dinner. There are more people in the morning, and the environment and food are better than the Chinese restaurant.


Environment: The overall environment is good. Compared with other five-star magnificence, the overall natural environment is good. The play area is relatively large, and there are many hot springs. The swimming pool is more like the Venetian in Macau except for the large swimming pool.

The children had a great time playing, and the elderly were very comfortable in the hot springs

msg:The check-in bracelet is not only the room card but also the certificate for entering the water world, breakfast restaurant, etc. The poolside room can go directly into the water from the balcony, and there are only double bed rooms. The family room has twin beds, and there are parent-child items such as children's bathrobes. Also sent fruit, milk. The buffet breakfast has many varieties and is quite rich. It is also OK to eat and drink at your own expense in the hot spring, and you can stay in the park for a whole day. When I checked in, I added the housekeeper Jinjin WeChat, and the service was very good.
The last four pictures are for the Children‚Äôs Paradise. Tickets are included in the package. If you buy tickets separately, it is not necessary, because the children in the hot spring area have already had a great time.

I booked a poolside room, the balcony door can be pushed directly into the water, the water is very shallow, suitable for kindergarten children to play in the water.
Service: The hotel's service attitude is very good, especially Xiao Wu'a Joy at the front desk. When I arrived at the hotel, I added WeChat and sent the hotel map, the time and precautions of various attractions. Hearing that the child was suddenly allergic, he immediately arranged for the staff to deliver oin**ent, and kept asking about the child's allergies. At night, I also reminded that there are latex pillows and buckwheat pillows that can be replaced. The work is serious and responsible, and it is worthy of praise!
Swimming pool: It‚Äôs a bit chilly these days on May 1st. The water in the swimming pool is relatively cold, but the enthusiasm of the children is high, and they immediately rushed to the spring water world to play on the slide. There are many hot spring pools, including fish therapy pools, five-element pools, red wine pools, etc., but each one is not very large. During the May Day period, there are many people and almost all of them are full.
Hygiene: The room is clean and tidy, and the water in the hot spring pool is relatively clean.
Cost-effectiveness: Every scenic spot is crowded with people during the May Day holiday, and hotels keep increasing their prices. Book one month in advance, the price is half cheaper than the one booked a few days before May Day, and the price is relatively high.

What's also funny is the parking problem in the hotel. There is also a traffic jam... After checking in at the front desk, two people must register to get the hot spring card! Obviously I ordered to send two coupons, this service is terrible! In the evening, the takeaway brother who ordered Meituan‚Äôs takeaway and didn‚Äôt give it to me sent the food to the downstairs lobby of the hotel. After communicating back and forth on the phone, he asked the security guard to deliver it to the downstairs lobby of the hotel, but he didn‚Äôt give it. It's useless. It's really ridiculous to ask customers to take a battery car to the security booth to pick it up after one o'clock in the morning. They also said that star hotels have poor service and dare not come in the future... and the cleanliness of the room is very poor, even the floor is dirty The mopping is not clean, the dust is thick, and the towels are old and hard, unhygienic! The water pressure of the shower head in the shower room is too low. What's even more funny is that the blower can't be used in the bathroom. Fortunately, I called for consultation, but there was a problem with the socket. The ceiling of the shower room also fell off! The sound insulation of the room is also poor, especially this bed will make noise when you turn over! Haha üòÑ At first glance, it is the Dongguan sauna room that I have been to before! Fortunately, I recognized it!

Speaking of breakfast... the breakfast is hard to describe. Your vegetable market is crowded and chaotic. After three rounds, there is no place. Then the little brother found a seat in the corridor, but there are few types of food and so many people. To be honest. I didn‚Äôt know how much saliva there was. Later, I took the two children to turn around and went to have morning tea at my own expense. I advise everyone, if you really can‚Äôt order breakfast, don‚Äôt order it. And if you don‚Äôt have a room outside, buy a breakfast voucher and go to eat , Negative score for breakfast! !
Besides the hot springs, the service is very good, there is a young lady who reminds me to drink water and pay attention to safety, and there is also an aunt who helps to take the shoes, and the little brother at the door has a very friendly attitude and warm reminders.

The lobby manager, Manager Chi, is even more hospitable and thoughtful. Helped solve various small problems encountered. I will definitely go next time.

msg:Before the holiday, I thought about where it would be better to take children and the elderly nearby. Two colleagues in our depar**ent recommended Tangxia Sanzheng Banshan Hot Spring Hotel to me, so I searched and quickly booked two rooms. I came to the hotel on the first day of the new year and drove into the gate. The environment inside is really nice, with lush green plants. After getting off the car, you can see smiling and guiding staff everywhere. There are many people checking in, but the speed is very fast. The staff The efficiency is very high. After check-in, the staff drove us to the rooms in various areas. In the afternoon, I took my two children to soak in the hot springs. The various hot spring pools are very comfortable. The children like it very much. The water world is only waiting for summer. Time to play with the kids! Regarding meals, during the two days we stayed in the hotel, except for the breakfast that was brought in the room, we ate at the Chinese restaurant of the hotel for the other three meals. Of course, a family of three of my friends ate in the cafeteria of the western restaurant, and the feedback was that the dishes were also very good [Strong][Strong][Strong] The happy time always passes quickly. Definitely stay at least one more day! The overall feeling of staying this time: 1. There has never been a hotel with so many hotel staff during the Chinese New Year, so the service is completely up to date. 2. Every detail of the hotel is well done, making us very happy and heartwarming. 3 Here, I would like to especially thank the manager Chi Haipeng of your hotel. He is handsome and considerate. He watched our family travel. When the room arrangement was so tight, he even upgraded one of our rooms to a suite and sent it specially. The tea set and New Year's snacks allowed our family to drink tea and chat happily together, and sent warm reminders from time to time throughout our trip, and extended the check-out time for us when we urgently cleaned up the room. All I can say is thank you Thanks ‚ù§Ô∏è! The hotel is not far from Shenzhen, and it will definitely be our frequent place in the future! Friends who want to book a room don't need to hesitate, take the time to experience the beauty here!

It was more comfortable than the children's room I stayed in for the second night. After all, it is a five-star hotel in China, and it is still somewhat There will be defects in the place. For example, there is no iron in the room. I borrowed an iron from the hotel but there is no ironing board. The staff said they could not find it. Fortunately, it is winter, and most clothes do not need to be ironed. If summer clothes are miserable, there is no ironing board The children's pleated skirt princess dress can't be ironed at all. The hotel's buffet breakfast and dinner are rich in variety, and the taste is not bad. Except for the seafood buffet dinner, the quality of seafood is not very good. For those who often eat seafood, it will be a bit disappointing, but the buffet breakfast salad dishes are relatively expensive. iced dishes, and the restaurant provides Vida small packs of tissues, which many five-star hotels cannot do. There is also a boating project on the hotel's lake. It is really comfortable to drive a boat on the lake, and the two children are vying to drive it.

I give it a five-point praise. The buffet was planted by his dessert, which happened in the hot spring after check-in There is a small problem, and I suggest that your hotel rectify it. I took two children, a boy and a girl, to the hot springs. Because my baby boy is only a few years old and less than 1.2 meters in length. He is not very capable of self-care, so I am not allowed to bring in female guests. Since the hotel stipulates, we also abide by it, and let them help take the male guests to change clothes. We changed with my daughter for about ten minutes. Because there were a lot of things to take, we delayed for a while. When we came out, we found that Our male baby was already waiting for me. The temperature that day was only about 6¬∞C. The baby was naked with a bath towel, and was still standing at the entrance of the hot spring shivering with bare feet waiting for us. As a five-star hotel, I don't think other hotels do this well.

Another thing I like is that the greenery inside is so good, you don't need to bring a sun umbrella when you walk to the hot spring area.
The indoor sanitation environment is also good, and then there are Western food, Chinese food, and a water bar in the park. The price is slightly more expensive, but the Sichuan food in Chinese food is not bad.

First of all, the service staff left an excellent impression on us. The concierge manager Chi Haipeng provided excellent service when we checked in. He also helped to coordinate our temporary request for changing the room type. Other hotel staff are also polite and smiling. Secondly, the hotel rooms are bright and tidy, the layout is reasonable, and the view is also very good. Once again, the dishes in the Chinese restaurant of the hotel taste good and the price is reasonable, which reduces the trouble for the guests to go out for food. Finally, the hotel has a lot of entertainment items, such as hot springs, water parks, children's parks, cruise ships, kayaks and electric surfboards, which are really suitable for all ages. Recommended.

The bedside light button is super difficult to use, the bedside lacks a socket, and the central air conditioner temperature control fails, no matter how it is adjusted, it will not stop, or it will be turned off. The toilet door handle is also broken, the door can only be turned up when closing the door, and the plug of the sink is also broken. When blowing hair, you can only blow it where the water is boiled. A five-star hotel, the room is not equipped with a bag. The buffet dinner and breakfast were chaotic, and before it was finished, the table was closed, or the table was almost assigned to others. The buffet food in the evening is still ok, but it is about 300 people, and I personally feel that the price/performance ratio is relatively low. The swimming pool is clear and clean. But the sand on the beach is too sticky, more like crushed stones, not sand. The lifeguards in the pool are full, responsible and watch closely. The hot springs are also average. Not quite like a hot spring. The overall feeling is very low value for money.

It looked very attractive, so I settled for a poolside room.) Due to the weather and travel time, it was already 6 pm when I arrived at the store, and the lobby was still crowded with people.
...
The front desk service is good, and the processing speed is quite fast. I took the hand strap and took the tram to the room. I didn't expect that there was a poolside restaurant next to the room, and quickly settled the dinner.

The hotel is an old-fashioned hotel, the environment is very comfortable and quiet, the rooms are clean, and the equipment is OK. The room is rather old but not bad. It is a poolside room, so pushing the door is the swimming pool. The child was so happy that he contracted the swimming pool by himself and didn't go anywhere.
...
(Dinner) The price of the buffet is more than 300, and the variety and production level are okay~ After all, it is a resort hotel.
(Breakfast) Breakfast is included in the room, and there are many types and good taste.
...
The hotel is too big and only enjoyed the swimming pool due to time constraints. If you haven't come to play, you will check out. You can only stay for two nights next time and enjoy the hotel's amu*****t facilities.
The overall feeling is not bad, thank Jiang Chuan for his help, as long as you ask him for the whole check-in process and hotel problems, he will help quickly, Ness!

We booked a family room, which is on the second floor of the parent-child viewing area, and the poolside room on the first floor. There is a small slide and rocking horse in the family room, as well as a small tent, which is very good. The children like it very much. The air conditioning of the hotel is also good. The most important thing is that the service attitude is great, and the response speed is very fast!
It is strongly recommended to look at the room in the water area, and walk to the parent-child water park and hot springs very close~
The hotel is very large. You can call a battery car anytime you want to go, and the battery car is available 24 hours a day.
However, many attractions also require additional tickets, such as outdoor sports centers, happy farms, etc.
Hotel reservations generally bring 2 tickets to the parent-child water park. There are many people in the water park. It is recommended to go in the afternoon. It is very dry in the morning.
The water park can rent kayaks, net red flamingos and other water tools, as well as water basketball, and exciting water slides. In short, there are still quite a few water sports, which are very suitable for bringing older people to play in the water.
There is also an indoor children's playground on the 5th floor of the hotel, suitable for smaller BBs
All in all, this hotel is pretty good. It belongs to the kind of people who have been there once and want to go again.

msg:Booked a poolside room, a hot spring room, the elderly and children are satisfied. Pushing open the balcony door is the feeling of the swimming pool. The indoor swimming pool and hot spring are also great. The lake is opposite, and there are water sports. Unfortunately, the time to come is a little short. The outdoor space of the hot spring room is also very large, and there is a small courtyard, which is very comfortable.

The taste is very good; I would like to mention Chi Haipengchi, the manager of the hotel, who upgraded the room for us, helped coordinate the dinner seats, and reminded us of various precautions in time. He was very responsible and enthusiastic. I am also surnamed Chi, and it is very fateful to meet the family with the surname Chi. All in all, I am very satisfied with the experience of this Mid-Levels Hotel. I will come to play again and recommend it to my friends!

The environment is good, the service is better, the management is mature, the activities are rich, and there is no end to play in a day, and the surrounding restaurants are convenient. The only dissatisfaction is that when I checked in at 13:30 on June 3 on the Dragon Boat Festival, the front desk said that there is no need to record the third person's face, and I can go to the hot spring area to temporarily record the third person to enter the venue. During the on-site phone verification, the third person could not be recorded by slapping the face, and it was very unpleasant that the delay was delayed for 40 minutes. It is hoped that in the future, the management depar**ents will have the same statement before and after, and the staff should be responsible for what they say, otherwise they will bring trouble to the guests.

msg:I spent a lot of time choosing a hotel. I saw that the hotel was renovated in 2018! I was stunned when I got there. It's not an exaggeration to say that it was renovated in 2008. I booked a room near the hot springs. As soon as I entered the room, the whole room was filled with a musty smell, which was very strong, even worse than the 30-yuan guesthouse!
I called the front desk to change to the main building, and the smell was much better, but it was really old and broken. How could they say that they renovated it in 2018! Did they give the five-star rating themselves?
Take a look at the hygiene of the room! As shown in the picture. The mirror and kettle were full of dust, and the towel rack was extremely dirty! And the towel was damp, I really regretted not bringing a towel! The washbasin was absolutely amazing, and the dirt on the leaking mouth was not an exaggeration to say that it was from 1982! It really disgusted me!
I booked a room near the hot springs, but because the room there was so ugly, I changed to the main building. The room I changed to was a regular lake view! But the room type I booked was more expensive than the lake view! This is my first time experiencing the free room type downgrade service! It's really a joke, and they won't take the initiative to make up for the price difference!
The only thing I think is good is that the hotel staff are very polite, they will take the initiative to greet and ask if they need help. To be honest, this is the only thing that makes it five stars.
This should be a hotel for elderly tour groups. If you want to stay in a hotel on weekdays, I really advise you not to stay. If you really want to come, bring your own sheets, quilt covers, towels and kettle!
Another complaint is that the water provided by the so-called five-star hotel is actually Ice Dew! Are all the express hotels Nongfu Spring? You can use snacks to operate!

The hotel is very close to the town center and it is convenient to travel, but this journey is still indescribable, and it is purely personal bad luck. First of all, the facial recognition in the hotel is not connected nationwide, so unless you have a Guangdong hukou, you must bring your documents, otherwise you need to go to the local police station to issue a certificate, please remind me! The second is to never put your mobile phone into the airtight bag provided by the hot spring hotel (here not only refers to the Sanzheng Mid-Levels Hotel) because it is really not waterproof. In the end, the Romance 520 ended with two mobile phones entering the water for maintenance...

It happens to be 5.2 and the temperature is slightly lower, and when the weather is good, you can swim and soak in the hot springs üòå I really know how to choose the time!
This time I booked a parent-child room, and the ocean-themed room was arranged for me. The only bad thing was that there was no balcony to hang clothes. The best thing is that this room type is in the main building, very close to the beach! As soon as you go out from the back door, you will find the artificial beach in Figure 5. There is no swimming lane in the main building.
The biggest surprise this time is that the service has improved! Every waiter has a great attitude! Now there is a butler service. When I check in, I added the butler Xiaoxue WeChat. She always reminds me of things to pay attention to. When I wake up, she reminds me to have breakfast before and when the peak season is. She reminds me that it is best to avoid the peak season. Knowing that there is a problem with the air-conditioning in my room, I can't sleep well, so I applied for a late check-out. Really sweet! Five-star service!

She was serious, patient and enthusiastic. Seeing that we were traveling as a couple, she also took special care to give gifts for the Year of the Tiger. The water-viewing room I ordered was also very considerate to upgrade the lake view for me. At that moment, I was in a really good mood. I opened the door and saw so many scenery. The whole person is super relaxed. Miss and sister also gave some play tickets, and experienced an electric swimming lake. This lake is really big, hahaha, and I am very enjoyable. I will come again next time, as soon as I have time. It's a really relaxing resort hotel I've been to so far. The main reason is that the service staff from the door to the logistics, to the front desk of the guest room, all the people they met were super polite and responded warmly. It can be seen that this hotel is really good, otherwise everyone is probably not energetic. anyway! Just one word! Great!

msg:It should be the best hot spring resort hotel around Shenzhen. I have heard of it for a long time before, but I finally came to experience it this time. The hotel occupies an area of 210,000 square meters, surrounded by mountains and rivers, with excellent scenery. The room is spacious, the 2.2-meter bed is super comfortable, and the terrace has a great view. Although it is off-season and the outdoor pool children‚Äôs water castle is closed, there are still dozens of hot spring pools and two heated swimming pools, which do not affect the experience. There are abundant facilities for children, including a temperature-controlled children‚Äôs swimming pool, a slide outside the western restaurant, and an indoor children‚Äôs playground, which is especially suitable for parent-child travel. In addition, the quality of the hotel‚Äôs restaurant is beyond imagination. The Chinese restaurant‚Äôs dishes are super rich and delicious. The western restaurant‚Äôs buffet of beef and grilled lamb chops is delicious. Xiao Xu, who received us, followed up the whole process and was very considerate. He knew that the children prepared birthday cakes for the decoration of the room for their birthdays. They thought it was a very small cake, but it turned out to be better than the cake shop selling. Four people can‚Äôt eat it. Finish. On the second day of Xiaoxu‚Äôs vacation, I also used private time to keep track of the service to help with late check-out, and the service was considerate and thoughtful. Disadvantages: I did not expect that the room will be full on weekends in the off-season. There are also wedding banquets for 7-800 people. The Chinese restaurant is booked at night and cannot eat. The buffet in the western restaurant is full of people. After booking a seat, there is no place to sit and wait. , Some dishes were told that they were sold out. But the manager of the restaurant clock is very good, knowing that we will serve us personally after waiting for a seat, and deliver a lot of special dishes. The birthday room was forgotten to decorate at first, and then I was reminded to decorate it. The entire hotel has no barrier-free facilities, there are steps everywhere, especially in the hot spring area, it is almost impossible to walk with a stroller. The elder of the family fell over in the shower room of the indoor swimming pool because the steps were too high to see clearly, but fortunately there was no fracture. I hope that in the future, the hotel will give more consideration to disadvantaged groups such as the elderly, the weak, the sick, the disabled and the young, more barrier-free facilities, and more humanistic care in the design of the hotel.

msg:A highly recommended resort hotel. I celebrated my birthday with my family for the second time. The environment is very good and the management is in place. The rooms are in the style of a five-star hotel in Southeast Asia. The projects are very rich and meet the different needs of the family. On vacation abroad, coming here is not worse than abroad. The housekeeper knows that my birthday is very intimate and sent a birthday cake. The check-out time is delayed, and he reminds me that I can re-enter the park before 3 pm after check-out. It is really warm Xin, now there is a Double Eleven event, ready to buy again

The hotel is quite big, and there are many places to play in the water, hot springs, swimming pools (hot water), water children's amu*****t facilities, and small trains.
The electric car in the hotel picks up guests to where they want to go for free.
Overall it is recommended! A good place to walk the baby!

I added WeChat and gave a brief introduction to some of the hotel‚Äôs facilities. Feel at home. Sanzheng is really a good place to bring a baby. Hot springs, fish feeding, target shooting, and wave pool should be available. The buffet booked at night is also very cost-effective. The taste is great, but there are slightly more people, and the overall is quite perfect. When we left, Susie took the initiative to ask to help us delay the check-out, let the baby sleep for a beautiful nap and then set off for deep, and praised the Sanzheng employee Susie. In general, I spent a perfect weekend with the elderly and children, and I will definitely come next time!

The front desk will not actively ask you if you can check in. You should ask if they can check in and whether they can check out half an hour later. She said you went to the luggage storage and fainted. The check out time is not on weekends. On Monday, a five-star hotel actually responded to guests like this;
There are many waiters in the hot spring pool, but no one actively asks you if you want to drink water. Every waiter stands on the side, and the soul is out of your body. When you are transparent and ask her questions, she just nods and doesn't even bother to speak. Haha; towels are seriously insufficient (not on holidays), ask them and let you find them by yourself. The same is true for the dressing room, it is hard to imagine, the five-star hotel is such a service.
Will not stay again! Negative Ratings!

I like apple sparkling wine. There are also traditional Cantonese dishes to choose from, Hakka pork knuckles and ginger. , Yam chicken feet in pot, Buddha jumps over the wall, favorite crayfish, very delicious! After dinner, with a cool night breeze, take a walk from Building 1 back to Building 5. The walk time is about 10 minutes. The trees are shaded along the way, and the birds and flowers are scented. In addition, you can have breakfast at the poolside restaurant in Building 5. Convenient, there are many choices of bathing pools in the hot spring area. Children like to play in the water. There are also many swimming pools here. There is also a separate swimming pool in Building 5 for swimming. Overall, the experience of staying is good, and I look forward to coming again next time!

The water park is very rich. The two children have a great time in the boat. The son‚Äôs favorite slide is reluctant to walk. The service staff along the way are superb!
Homemade dinner is also very rich, but be sure to book a table early, there are too many people! When the hairy crabs were eaten, I was very satisfied. After eating, I went to the Mid-Autumn Festival party to play games. They are all children's favorites!
The breakfast has to be in turn. Now everyone is crowded into Guangdong to play in the epidemic. People are everywhere, but soon, the waiter in the poolside restaurant in black clothes and hats is commendable.

I did not expect to upgrade to a parent-child hot spring room when the availability was very tight. It was a big surprise. The buffet breakfast and dinner are very rich, Chinese and Western styles are available, and crayfish and oysters are eaten at random for dinner, which is so cool. There are enough pools in the hot spring area, and the temperature is set reasonable, so adults and children can soak. Although there are a lot of people during the holiday, the hotel's service can still maintain a high standard. Here, I would like to praise Xiaoyu YOGA. He is very polite. From check-in to check-out, warm reminders will be sent in the morning, afternoon and evening, so I am not afraid at all. Missed the wonderful show and meal time. Finally, let me talk about improvement suggestions: one is that the staff in the hot spring area said that there is also a fish spa in the foot spa area on the first floor of the main building. In fact, there is no fish spa. We ran back and forth several times, and finally did not experience the fish spa. I hope to strengthen the staff's business. Training; one is that the actual temperature of the room air conditioner is higher than the displayed temperature. I don't know why. But the flaws are not concealed, and I hope to meet again at Tangxia Sanzheng Hotel as soon as possible.

msg:The service is very good, especially the beauty of the front desk customer service Weiwei. I contacted and added WeChat in advance, and posted the location and precautions very carefully. Gave the phone back. This is great! ! Also upgraded the room type for free. I stayed for two days and the room was good. Although the hotel is a bit old, the outdoor swimming pool and hot spring are good. The children are very happy and they are crazy to play in the water. After checking out, you can go in and play, and finally check out and play until four o'clock in the afternoon. Breakfast is ok, with a lot of people. The taste of the Chinese restaurant is average, it is more expensive, and it charges a 15% service charge. There are farms and Wanda nearby, so driving out to eat is fairly convenient. You can also order take-out, and the battery car can be picked up at the door and ordered once, which is quite convenient. The bread in the hotel bakery is delicious, you can try it.

msg:Very good parent-child hotel. Every staff in the hotel has a very good service attitude, very kind and enthusiastic, and answer all questions. Pillows and quilts can be provided according to the needs of customers. Because the pillows in the hotel are too soft, let work The staff changed to buckwheat pillows and they were sent to the room immediately. The buckwheat pillows were very comfortable. The swimming pool inside the hotel is very large, there is a small beach for children to play, and there are water slides. If you are an adult, you can relax in a hot spring. This time I booked a children's themed hot spring room. The facilities in the room are for children. There are bathrobes, slippers, toothbrush supplies, etc. for children, as well as a toilet stand for children. The most surprising thing is this self-heating The towel rack is easy to use. A satisfactory hotel and would recommend it to relatives and friends.

The local price is high but the service quality is also high! When you check out, the shuttle bus will be delivered directly to the parking lot, and the key will be given to the attendant of the shuttle bus and then drove away directly.

The hotel gave me a free upgrade after booking, from a deluxe poolside double bed room to a suite. It was very clean and recommended. You can go into the water as soon as you get out of the balcony, like a private swimming pool, anyway, children like it very much. It is also very convenient to go to the hot spring area, and the facilities are well-equipped, so the children can enjoy themselves very well. The hotel is located at the Guansong Expressway, with convenient transportation. It's a good choice if you take the kids and don't want to leave Wanwan.

msg:During the children‚Äôs holiday, I invited a few friends to meet in the mid-levels of Sanzheng, and booked a lake-view room. Thanks to sister Wenwen at the front desk for upgrading the room type for one of us. Welcome fruits, protective gift packs, and mascots feel warmer and feel "going home"!
Looking around, there are green mountains and green waters, lakes and mountains, water shining, lush, scent of birds and flowers, and a fairyland on earth!
The room facilities are all available, the hardware has nothing to say, the highlight: there is actually floor heating, drying racks.
Hot springs, playing in the water, boating, fishing, cycling, rowing, tennis, badminton, basketball, field battles, etc., let the children enjoy it and linger forever! A good place to walk your baby, absolutely hilarious!
The breakfast buffet is rich in variety and delicious!

The nearby Vanke Commercial City, which is 2 kilometers away, is very convenient for shopping and dining!
The sister of the hotel said that it covers an area of 6000 acres and the greening rate is as high as 80%. It is a veritable "natural oxygen bar", very suitable for summer vacation!

msg:I saw the Internet celebrity hotel on Xiaohongshu. I immediately booked a two-night itinerary. The room type is a deluxe lakeside room. The room is large and the balcony can be directly down to the swimming lane. It is not too convenient! The welcome gift sent by the hotel and the daily necessities specially for the little pots were warmed up. It was very heart-warming~ The water in the swimming pool was very clean, without the smell of bleach, and every place I swam was a feeling of changing scenery. Affected by the epidemic, there are not too many guests on weekdays. It feels like a private room. Whether it is a restaurant, a house or a battery car, the service is very good... There is a feeling of Thai hotel service, I really like it! Because the hotel is surrounded by mountains and water, the ecology is very good, except that there are a lot of mosquitoes, the other is no problem~ it is very suitable to bring a small pot of friends, just do a good job of mosquito prevention

I ordered the takeaway, and asked the guest to run to the security booth 800 meters away from the hotel entrance, call to let the boy go, or put the takeaway in the security booth, and even curse people with a bad attitude, haha. This kind of attitude and service, you can imagine how often the management fails, the experience is super poor, I do not recommend everyone to go, like to be abused for a lot of money, you can ignore it

The water park and hot springs are simply dumplings. The breakfast line is almost an hour before it is lined up, and the water park swimming ring needs to be rented for another 50 hours for an hour!
