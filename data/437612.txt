msg:The hotel’s location is very convenient for anyone who wants to fly out from Hongqiao airport; it only takes a few minutes to walk over there. 

The service provided is very good.  Essentials such as Shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, body lotion, toothbrush and toothpaste are provided. I booked a room with breakfast included, which was a great choice.  The breakfast buffet has tons of options to choose from.  

Staff are friendly and helpful. Srui Tong arranged found a room with a window for my stay.  The room is very clean and quiet ; Two complimentary bottle water are provided. 

I had a nice stay, will be back soon.

msg:Strange booking rules. Booked the room, paid 750 yuan in deposit. This will be paid back in a week or so according to website. Then at the hotel I hade to pay same amount plus 500yuan as a security fee. So for a room that only cost 750 I hade to pay 1250 in security/deposit. I understand this will be payed back to me. But what if I have limited amount of RMB. All the other 5 står hotels I stayed at in shanghai,  I only paid in full in the booking app. The hotels never once asked me for deposit, security etc. Decor in hotel is old but clean. But super convenient...right at terminal 2.

The location is prime but its drawbacks is also the location. Uber driver couldn’t come up to the front lobby, but the ground level car park. It caused a lot confusion and wasted time for me and the driver to find each other. I can’t imagine if there is a language barrier.

Please note that you will need to be searched everytime you enter the airport. Not a big deal as it is common in general places too

Breakfast is really good and has great variety.

Please note that there is no SPA at this hotel. It seems it was shutdown.

Fitness center is good with many different machines.

As we were exhausted we didn’t bother calling down to front desk to get fixes so just cracked open window. TV signal seemed like it was standard definition. Overall okay stay for cancelled flight with purpose for convenience to fly out early next day.

msg:Superb location, just right in the terminal. We initially thought we need to walk out of terminal and walk for a distance. But turn out that it’s just right at the terminal.
Hotel entrance is at the departure level where all the flight check in counters are.

There’s a indoor walkway to the high speed train and metro train station. Along the walkway are shops and restaurants. About 8-10 min walk to station.

Taxi stand is just right below. Take the carpark lift to ground floor.
Though the exhibition hall is nearby, but it’s quite a hassle to take car or taxi to the exhibition due to the busy morning traffic.
The traffic was so bad when nearing the area. We ended up alighting at road side and walked in.
The better option is to walk to metro station and take line 2, straight right to exhibition hall, 1 stop only. Buying of train tickets is easy, at the machine, English is available and able to pay cash at the machine.

Hotel is nice clean and comfortable. But the reception counter seems a little mismanaged. There was quite a queue when people want to check in or out, but only 2 receptionist were available during the busy morning period, thus the long queue. 

Overall we enjoyed the stay, and will definitely stay again if we need to go to the exhibition or have early or late flight.

My only complaint is that the hallway outside my room was sporadically loud until about 1 o'clock. I'm not sure if it was other guests or work from the lobby, but it was a little frustrating when I had to be up so early but couldn't sleep well. In the end, it wasn't a bit deal though. I slept well after that and had easy access to the airport come morning! I will stay here again next time I have an early flight.

I did have to rely on my Chinese at times. 
Small detail: Now, I actually lived in Shanghai, so when the front desk said that you could order delivery to your room, I had several ideas. But they don't say that not even the place five minutes away will deliver to this area (I tried for like 3 hours). A lot of delivery options weren't available, so if you stay here, prepare to also spend a lot of money for the room service.

msg:Another fantastic stay. Check in was easy, the staff were polite, and everything was clean and presentable. The welcome drink and snack was greatly appreciated. Unlike some other hotels in China, the air conditioner was not preset and I was able to choose my own temperature. As I was flying back to Australia I needed my PCR test printed and the lady in the business centre was very helpful. As I’m leaving China permanently this was most likely my last stay here so thank you everyone for making each of my stays comfortable and stress free. 非常感谢🙏🏻！

I plan to take the high-speed train again the next day.
It would take about half an hour just to go through security and walk through the long aisle.
So I have to leave the hotel about an hour early.
Find out where to take the high-speed rail
The space in the room is very small
But the 28-inch luggage is full when opened on the floor.
The water in the bathroom is very hot and has plenty of water.
The shower feels great
Whether in the lobby or in the room
The cleaning lady is very proactive and professional.
It's really a non-smoking room without any smell of smoke.
The concierge’s reception registration needs to be strengthened
Foreign customers should use tracking numbers instead of mobile phone numbers

msg:That night, I flew from Shenzhen to Shanghai and arrived at Hongqiao Airport T2 at 10:30. Because I had to catch a flight at Hongqiao T2 at around 6 o'clock the next day, and I didn't want to bother with a hotel outside the airport, a local friend recommended the Boyue Hotel, which was really not too convenient! When you get out of the arrivals floor and take the elevator to the third floor, you can see the hotel's sign. The beautiful woman at the front desk was very nice. Seeing me dragging two suitcases alone, she immediately helped my little brother take me up.
Although the hotel is not big, it is clean and tidy and designed in Japanese style! like very much! Definitely recommend it to friends who arrive in the middle of the night and need to take a flight the next day!

The most important thing is that the boarding security check is very convenient, provided that you don’t need to check in luggage. The only thing I'm not satisfied with is that there is only one room card. I have to go to the restaurant in the morning. There is no electricity in the room. I hope it can be improved.

Although the hotel is located at the airport, it is not noisy at all. The hotel bedding is clean and tidy, and the equipment is complete. Our room window can directly see the airport apron, and the main entrance of the hotel is the drop-off platform.

Finally, I called 110 and complained to the police, who helped solve the problem. The hotel only thought that it was near the airport facilities and did not want to cause trouble, so it did not want to propose any effective solutions to the customers at that time, nor did it want to fundamentally solve the problem.
The effect of soundproof glass is also very poor. Shouldn't this be the most important facility in a hotel next to the airport?

It only takes seven or eight minutes to walk underground from the hotel to the high-speed rail station through the T2 terminal. The front desk clerk Tong Jiabao also upgraded the room type, which was so considerate. You can see the tarmac, and the check-in and check-out procedures were very fast. This time I checked into the hotel and found that there is a small gym. Although there are not many facilities due to the space, there are one or two commonly used fitness equipment, which is very good. Not many domestic guests exercise, and occasionally there are some foreign friends, so Basically it feels very spacious. I don’t miss work and fitness. I will choose to stay here next time I go there.

🦁🦁🦁State-owned enterprises, word-of-mouth and quality still have a bottom line and grade. The decoration has been a few years old, but the management and service are superior. The customer service, security, cleaning and engineering depar**ents are all polite, very kind, and always answer questions. Dad, as an old professor of Jiaotong University, praised the hotel.

🦁🦁🦁 There is a Chinese restaurant on the third floor, the taste and environment are good; the second floor is a western restaurant, a place for breakfast (meals are also served at other times, and the price is reasonable), the replenishment is very timely, and you can go downstairs at any time Meals, food storage and display are all full, and the Intercontinental, Marriott, Hilton and Shangri-La groups are basically impossible to do, very pleasantly surprised; the second floor is still a gym (no swimming pool); the eleventh floor is the executive lounge, where you can take a break And business meetings are available.

🦁🦁🦁Surrounding supporting facilities, although there are not as many types of business in Singapore Airport, it can be seen that the Airport Group is also working hard and approaching. After passing through the security check channel, there is the airport food corridor. On the third and fourth floors, more than 90% of the businesses with brands are economical. Recovery is just around the corner.

msg:Recommended Hongqiao Airport Hotel｜🛫️😁
If you catch an early flight or early train or arrive at midnight, it is recommended to stay at AVIC Hongqiao Airport Boyue Hotel. Right at the T2 terminal entrance, it is very convenient to go to the airport or the high-speed rail station. If you take off from T1 terminal, it is not recommended! The attitude of the front desk staff is very good, especially Wang Ke, the concierge, who helped me carry the oversized suitcase 🧳 throughout the whole process, and also introduced the subway transfer routes to several scenic spots in Shanghai. You can tell the staff in advance that you want to live in a quiet room without much noise. You can rest assured that you will check in on August 4 and check out on August 6. It is a very comfortable experience.
Get out of the Hongqiao T2 terminal subway station, take the vertical elevator directly to the 3rd floor, and then face the check-in desk. The hotel is on the right side of the check-in desk D area, and it is easy to find
The hotel goes to Hongqiao High-speed Railway Station. After coming out of the hotel, you don’t need to go outside to the check-in desk area. It’s always indoors, and you don’t need to go up and down the stairs. You will see the train sign. Follow the sign and you will arrive at the security checkpoint on the third floor. Very Convenient, you can walk there in ten minutes
Go to the hotel to check in, and the check-in desk is very convenient when you come out. The hotel seems to have a special security check channel. I haven't tried it. You guys can try it. You can ask the front desk
Get out of the high-speed rail station to find a hotel, get out of the station, and directly look for the vertical elevator from the T2 terminal to the third floor, and look for the check-in desk in area D

It is recommended that friends who have this need must choose a room facing the runway above 9 o'clock. I live in 905, the vision is very positive, and the hotel service is also very good. Knowing that there are children, I also bought an extra pair of slippers and washing supplies for children Delivery to the room, there is another point, maybe there are more foreign guests, the breakfast is the ceiling of this level, the location of the hotel is in the departure hall of Hongqiao Terminal 2, it is easy to find, takeaway can also be delivered, go to Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street and sit directly It takes about 40 minutes to arrive on Line 2. You need to go through the airport security check to get in and out of the subway, and it will not be too much trouble. When you go back to Shenzhen, you will go to the check-in area as soon as you get out of the hotel by plane. It is convenient. Generally speaking, it is recommended!

The overall health of the hotel is good, but it cannot conceal the fact that the facilities are slightly outdated; the staff of the hotel have poor service awareness, which is probably inherited from Air China 😅 The attitude from check-in to check-out is indifferent; the surrounding environment is poor, due to the close proximity to the airport apron. Noise pollution is unavoidable; finally, don't stay here if you are traveling! ! ! Don't ask me why, it's fine to take a round-trip taxi in the city for 100+, the key is that there are traffic jams all the time😅

The room is not big, but after all, it is a hotel in transition for business, and the three of us will not feel crowded. The transportation is convenient, directly connected to the terminal building, and it is very convenient for eating, shopping and subway travel. The hotel also has its own security check channel when boarding the plane.
The service is very considerate. Seeing that we brought our baby, we were given the highest floor of this room type. The angle is also very good, basically facing the takeoff point of the flight path. On the first day, we had medicines that needed to be refrigerated dispensed at the Shanghai Hospital. When we checked out, we had to go to a museum. The front desk service staff helped us store the refrigerator. When we came back, we went to the lobby bar to ask for ice cubes for us to refrigerate on the road. Thank you so much.
The breakfast is also quite good, not as good as a five-star resort hotel, but it has a complete range and is very cost-effective.
The only slightly troublesome thing is that because it is directly connected to the terminal building, you need to go through the security check channel when entering and exiting.

It's near Gate 2 of T2 of Hongqiao Airport. The location is a bit hidden, so I asked people along the way. The family suite has a large room, a cloakroom and two bathrooms. It is very convenient for a family to live in. The windows are all facing the runway, the key is that the glass is wiped clean, it is a holy place for taking pictures of airplanes. The fly in the oin**ent is that the sewer in the living room will smell bad, but other than that, the hygiene and toiletries are pretty good.

Service: There is a welcome fruit gift box. The air conditioner is too powerful. If you want to add more quilts when you are cold, you have to tell early. If you call at night and ask, you will be told that there are no extra quilts.
Breakfast and dinner are good, it is a bit unexpected to have such price and quality at the airport.
The exclusive check-in and security check channels are great. If you don’t have checked luggage, you can go in and board the plane directly in the hotel.

msg:In order to participate in bw and bml, I booked AVIC, the picture is convenient, and I got a room facing the airport runway according to my request. No matter how tiring the daytime schedule is, watching the planes take off and land at night to fall asleep, the fatigue of the whole day is swept away. The breakfast is great, and the price is stable. It has become a cost-effective choice instead of a big price increase because of the exhibition. If you come to bw and bml next year, you will book your restaurant.

Value for money: I think the value for money is very good.
Breakfast: very rich.
Bed: moderate hardness, pillows are also very comfortable!
Hygiene: very good!
Parking: The parking lot is hard to navigate, it seems to be free for 24 hours. If you live for a long time, ask the front desk how to park for free.
Room View: This is really good! This time I live here to let the children watch the plane! I deliberately chose the room on the airport side. good!
Location and transportation: We rent a car, so it is very convenient. It takes a long time to get to the city by subway, and it will be tiring to go back and forth. It is recommended to rent a car.
Service: very good! From the check-in at the front desk, everything is good!
I chose this place specifically to let the children watch the plane, and it is true that such a wish can be fulfilled. It's just that there is still noise for sleeping at night, and it lasts for a long time. It's acceptable.
The hotel has its own fast security check channel. After check-out, you can go through the fast security check directly from the hotel, and there are basically no people. The advantage of living here is that if you fly the next day, you will have breakfast and get your boarding pass. If you are in economy class, you can choose the seat in the front row at will. Because it is a two-step process to set up a card counter.
Furthermore, there are really a lot of food in the airport, so you don’t need to worry about eating.
It's just that if you are here to play, it is recommended to rent a car, then it is very convenient here. To go to Disneyland, you have to drive on the expressway and take the elevated road, which is better than traffic jams in the urban area.
It is also suitable for business travelers who have an early flight the next day to choose here.
Overall very recommended.

msg:There is a problem with the cleanliness of the guest rooms, and the facilities are a bit outdated. The female staff on duty at the switchboard talked nonsense when answering questions and refused to admit their mistakes, so they couldn't communicate... The overall positive evaluation is because the manager on duty is serious and responsible, and has empathy. The escalator was out of service during the day, and the male waiter took the initiative to go upstairs to help carry the luggage down. The duty manager Wang gh should be commended for his good attitude and quick response in dealing with problems! The front desk is often overwhelmed, and the waiting time for procedures or consultation is relatively long. There are few people in the exclusive security check channel. The location after the security check is close to the lounges of China Eastern Airlines and China Southern Airlines, but very far from the Air China lounge. At breakfast, there was a waitress who had nothing to do and stood by "maintaining" her hands.

It only takes 5 minutes from the hotel to the T2 check-in gate with its own security check channel. You can eat at the hotel at night or go to the T2 service area, where there are many restaurants. Alternative, I feel that the flight room of 500 per night is a great value, because I slept soundly, and I don’t have to worry about being in a hurry early in the morning. On the 11th floor platform of the hotel, I took photos of the plane taking off and landing. I recommend everyone to stay

The front desk staff immediately reported to me when they saw that I was inconvenient to move. To the manager, the manager upgraded me to their deluxe room, because the flight room I booked couldn't push a wheelchair, I was surprised that they didn't let me pay for the upgrade but upgraded me for free, which made me travel all over the world The people I feel are touched and unbelievable. I was hospitalized the next day and needed surgery. Their manager also sent me a message of condolences on WeChat. My luggage was also packed and stored for me. I was alone in Shanghai and broke my leg again. Foreigners, I think it is very humane. I will recommend it to my company executive when I go back. This hotel is definitely worthy of our company's long-term cooperation

msg:In fact, the environment of the hotel is quite good, but I have to say that I had already communicated with the front desk before I stayed, and I left very early in the morning when I checked out. After the front desk gave me the invoice, I didn’t check it carefully and found it when I got home. A special value-added tax invoice was issued. After I called and communicated, I added WeChat at the front desk to make revisions. In fact, I understand that it is inevitable to make mistakes when I am busy, but the last sentence broke my defense. I did not want to send it when I requested that the invoice could not be sent back. Not only did I not apologize to the customer, but I also thought about not sending the delivery, which made me very angry.

msg:I came to Shanghai to do business and asked my classmates to come out to play. I didn’t want to bother, so I booked this hotel. I stayed in the flight room in the annex building once before. This time I experienced the double bed room in the main building.

Environment: Located in Terminal 2 of Hongqiao Airport, many taxi drivers don’t know much about it, so enter directly from the terminal building, very close to the check-in hall
Hygiene: The sanitation of the guest room is in place. Even though many guests will catch the plane and leave the hotel early in the morning, the hotel has prepared umbrellas, green bags, and rich breakfast. It won’t be sloppy because it’s an airport hotel
Service: Negotiating with the hotel for late check-out due to some reasons, the front desk staff explained the relevant policies and fees patiently and carefully
Of course, the disadvantages are also here: first of all, the supplementary 50% of the room fee does not deduct the breakfast fee. I personally think it is unreasonable, after all, it does not involve meals.
And when I left the store the next day, I confirmed the relevant expenses with the lady the day before yesterday. The other lady at the front desk seemed to be smiling a little... helpless... Of course, I may have misunderstood her meaning when I was wearing a mask. The service attitude is very satisfactory.

Live on the 8th floor! Close to the direction of the airport, the sound of planes taking off and landing is obvious, but it doesn't seem to affect sleep. Unexpectedly, at around 12 o'clock in the morning, I was about to go to bed when I heard a series of noises ranging from small to loud. The sound of throwing heavy objects. After a long time, I fell asleep in a daze. I heard the noise of vehicles and other noises twice in the middle, and I was completely woken up at 3 o'clock in the morning. Get out of bed and look downstairs, the good guy excavators are dispatched, shoveling a pile of construction waste on the road next to the parking lot downstairs of the hotel. A group of small cars and several large cars did not leave until after four o'clock. excuse me? I don't know what time it is? From 12 o'clock in the morning to 4 o'clock in the morning, if the residential area can really call the police directly, the hotel may not know about it, but the check-in experience is really bad. If you find a hotel near the residential area to live in, at least no one will be building downstairs at night, right?

I have stayed here with my family before. This time I lived alone at first, and later my friends came to accompany me at night, so it won’t be crowded if two people live together.

Hygiene: The bathroom is very spacious, which I like very much
Environment: The sound insulation is relatively good, I didn't hear any sound from the corridor outside
Service: The lady at the front desk has a very good service attitude. I arrived earlier and helped me arrange a room with a window. ❤️
Facilities: Good, nothing damaged

Overall praise, will come again in the future~

You don’t need to go out of the airport, take the elevator from the arrival floor to the departure floor, walk to the check-in counter D, and you will see the hotel entrance.
There are self-service check-in machines near the CD check-in counter. Take the elevator from the hotel room to the 4th floor, walk to the self-service check-in machine and check the time for 2 minutes. People who are catching a plane can check in first, and then go back to the room slowly check out.
I will come again next time I transit overnight.

It has an attitude of a government official who loves to come or not, and even the government depar**ents are not satisfied with it. Speaking of service awareness, can't AVIC Boyue reflect on it? Should the hotel's leadership also take some responsibility to supervise and inspect it? I called four times to take care of the items left at the hotel, but they were not even taken care of. It was worse than a B&B! The key is that the iron rice bowl cannot be smashed!

msg:This was a very bad stay experience! The special offer for fishing in the flying room at the front desk of the hotel has misleading consumption and low prices! This behavior is not acceptable to consumers.
The specific process is: on November 30, I found this hotel on Ctrip because I had to catch a plane at Hongqiao Airport the next day. This hotel shows a special price of 410 on Ctrip. When we checked in, the hotel offered us a free upgrade to a double room, saying that this room would make our stay more comfortable. Our outbound itinerary changed that night, and we needed to stay for another four days before leaving Shanghai. So I booked two more orders on Ctrip, one order is for check-in from December 1st to December 2nd, and the other list is for check-in from December 2nd to December 5th. At 10:00 am on December 1st, I went to the front desk to extend my room. As a result, the front desk clerk hesitated for a long time. I thought that the back of the room I lived in was booked out. As a result, the front desk invited the sales manager out, and the female sales manager said, I booked a special flight room, and I can’t upgrade it if I continue to stay. If I want to continue to live in the previous twin room, I have to make up to 560 yuan/night , the price difference is 150 yuan/night. I said I can't accept this difference, I don't have such a high budget. I said, then I will live in the flight room! As a result, the sales manager said: "The flight room is very small, with only one bed, 15 square meters, you can't fit in it." My daughter asked: Can we refund it? The female sales manager said: "Our hotel is refundable" and refunded the deposit to my account. At this time, my daughter said that she checked the comparison on booking. The double room we live in is bigger and the luxury double room is only 518 RMB/night for 40 sq. You can cancel the Ctrip order, and we can also accept it if you order it on booking.” We feel that the hotel is charging from the ground, which is not acceptable. From the beginning to the end, the sales manager did not inform me that a 1-night guarantee fee would be charged for the cancellation of my order. And she also emphasized to me: "Their hotel will not be canceled, it all depends on Ctrip." I said: "The room fee is charged by your hotel, not by Ctrip, as long as you can cancel it.
After I left the store, after 6 hours of communication between Ctrip and the hotel, at 17:00 on December 1st
I was told by Ctrip that the hotel did not agree to cancel my order for check-in on December 1 for free, and would deduct my one-night room fee of 410 yuan. The whole process was very uncomfortable for me and my daughter. First, we have never seen a business that pushes customers away. Second, we want to continue to live, not only can't take good care of the old customers, but also raise the price. Thirdly, the hotel drives away the customers with just rhetoric, and charges the customers room rates. I think this is extremely unreasonable. Fourth, none of us have seen what the so-called flying room looks like, and we were sent away based on rhetoric, and 410 yuan was forcibly deducted. I can now suspect that the hotel did not have 410 flight rooms available for us to check in that day, and the hotel used this room to catch customers on Ctrip! We didn't see the room type of flying room in the booking on the external network.
The environment of this hardware hotel is very good, but the service personnel have a poor sense of integrity and customer first, and its service does not match the five-star standard! Very disappointing experience!

Park Yue lives up to its name, there is joy in stopping and staying. The road is close and you can't go out of T2, saving time, effort and money. Quiet, comfortable bedding, sleep through the night. Sanitation facilities are ready for use. Although the breakfast is self-service and cannot be eaten in the restaurant, it can be moderately hot or cold, especially my favorite hot black coffee and bread, and a large box of fruit.

It was much better if I didn't drink it on the third day. Maybe the beans were not suitable for me... The room was okay, and it was enough for business trips. Going out and taking a taxi to the taxi point on the first floor is more convenient and quicker than calling a taxi. The operating vehicles are not allowed to enter the parking lot, so I have to go through two checkpoints, which delays the time.

Not to mention the hotel breakfast, there are many varieties, you can eat at 6 in the morning, both Chinese and Western styles are available. If it is too late, you can also pack a light meal, which is very convenient. As far as breakfast is concerned, it is worth the money.
Finally, I must praise the beautiful Ella who checked in at the front desk. She was careful, explained the questions I asked patiently, and also told me how to get to the nearest accounting, the latest time, and other information. She is absolutely professional.
All in all, the location is great, the breakfast is great, the service is great, Ella is even better. Highly recommended.

msg:That's outrageous! ! Ridiculously bad! !

1. Hongqiao T2 is next door. If you go to T1, it takes about 15 minutes to take a taxi for 7 to 8 kilometers.
2. The security was extremely bad. When I checked in, I was carrying two boxes and did not help to pick them up. Instead, I was asked to scan the code to register immediately. After asking the concierge to help, I was asked to find the concierge myself after entering. No matter how bad it is, it is still a five-star hotel. Is the security level at this level? The security guard who was on duty around 10 o'clock on August 9 is strongly recommended to be replaced.
3. The vacation was extremely poor. After expressing dissatisfaction, I was upgraded to an executive room with a standard room of nearly 1,000 yuan. The space is small, the water pressure is low, the facilities are poor, and the overall quality is not as good as any chain brand express hotel. As a person who despises five-star standards, I think it insults the word "five-star".
4. The bug was so serious that I felt uncomfortable lying on the bed. After asking someone to check it, I found that the original wooden board had not been removed. Isn't this level of mistake outrageous?
5. Poor service. It took 25 minutes from the discovery of the bed board problem to the resolution of the problem. One minute for each of the three phone calls (one of which did not get through), two minutes for removing the bed board, and 20 minutes of waiting time (as promised on the first call) Arrive and resolve the issue within five minutes)
6. Poor hygiene, the towels have a peculiar smell, and there is dirt after opening the mattress.
7. The breakfast is very poor. You can’t eat in but take it away. The food you take away is not even as good as Atour, let alone five-star standard.


Is it because this hotel is rated five stars because of its relationship with China Airlines? This is one of the worst hotels I have stayed in so far during the epidemic. The only thing I am satisfied with is the crisis public relations provided by Manager Xu in the lobby and the handling attitude of Ctrip Black Diamond customer service that day. However, my personal merits cannot cover up the overall disgrace.

msg:Friends of Cheng, no matter which floor you are on, do not live in the row of rooms No. 06-12. To be more specific: Room 712, the front desk who gave me check-in is really amazing! Look at me with a child and even arrange the noisiest room! Other hotels either assign a quiet room or ask if there is a requirement. As a result, when there were not many guests, the room I was given was not only at the elevator entrance, but also outside the window was a place where the airport freight works, it was so noisy! At one o'clock in the middle of the night, I really couldn't bear to ask to change the room. When I changed to the opposite row, it was quiet for a moment, which means that there is a better one, but they won't give it to you when you check in! And when changing rooms, the waiter didn't help with luggage at all, and left after giving you the room card. . . It's been a long time since I've lived. . .

msg:Overall, the experience was unusually bad, worse than a piece of ****. It was originally to save time to stay in an airport hotel, which is twice as expensive as a hotel of the same class not at the airport; I experienced a very shocking experience: I took a plane at 7:50, and the plane was in T1 terminal; at 5:58, I went to the hotel reception and took a taxi to T1 , taxis can’t arrive at 6:40, taxis are not allowed in the hotel parking lot (maybe only private cars are allowed in), the entrance of the parking lot is 1 mile away from the hotel, taxis need to go around a long way to a place closer to the lobby, the hotel lobby The manager actually blamed me for not finding a Didi car, and also for the taxi not being able to find the location he designated, but he did not blame himself for making a rule that no taxis were allowed to enter, and did not help the taxi drivers to coordinate; the lobby manager asked me It takes 20 minutes to go to the subway, where you are not familiar with, scanning codes and security checks. Fortunately, I am a long-distance runner. Fortunately, there is no queue at the airport security check. Fortunately, the plane is more than ten minutes late. Fortunately, none of these three happened. , I will miss the plane. That is to say, I stayed in an airport hotel and departed 2 hours early, but I couldn't catch the plane. Arguably the worst airport hotel ever. Even if it is a hotel near the low-end airport, it will not be so bad.

msg:🤗 I came to Shanghai for business and stayed at the Boyue Hotel located in Hongqiao T2 terminal. The check-in was on the 2nd floor, which was very fast and smooth. I chose the low-profile room type "flying room". The waiter will take the initiative to help carry the luggage to the room on the 3rd floor, and also help to insert the card and get the electricity before leaving. The service is praised!

The interior of the room is not big. It belongs to the type of sparrows that are small and complete. There are windows but they are not big. The toiletries are very complete, the spare parts are acca kappa, and the front desk gave me a wash bag, which is very business. The room is equipped with bottle openers, ice buckets, tea cups, and a weight scale. The equipment is quite complete. There are also snacks and soft drinks on the table, which is very considerate 😋

⚠️ The fly in the oin**ent is that there is no charging socket at the bedside, and the mobile phone is charged at the desk, which is not very convenient. TVs cannot be projected, although business hotels generally cannot. The toilet is not heated.

It is also very convenient to live here and take a taxi. Take the elevator and go down to the 1st floor. There are many taxis lining up at the taxi stand! Online car-hailing needs to be called to the downstairs parking lot. In addition, takeout can be delivered to the front desk.

At first, I was very worried about the epidemic, and I was afraid that the captain would be easily infected. Later, I learned that if someone is infected, the entire hotel will be blocked. So now, the hotel is still very safe, and the inspections for entry and exit are strict.
It is estimated that everyone has this kind of filter, not many people live, but it becomes safer. This price is a bargain for a five-star hotel in the airport. Ordinary hotels farther away also have this price.

But for this so-called flight room, the front desk will also inform it during check-in that the room is relatively small and has no windows, which is true, so there is nothing to say. But when the waiter provides a wake-up service to a guest in a certain room early in the morning, why can't you call the room? Why do you have to have the front door accompanied by loud housekeeping and continue to wake up the entire floor! I believe I was not the only one who was woken up inexplicably, because when someone else opened the door, the waiter yelled in a funny way: "I didn’t call you!" Well, that’s great, I enjoyed the "value-added service" early in the morning.
In addition, can this socket be replaced? The holes are all loose. The cord of this small hair dryer was originally short, and it came out of the socket after a little pull, and the hair fell out at least 100 times after blowing.
The advantage is that the toiletries may be the same as the ones used in the main building, the Acca kappa used

On a business trip to Shanghai, I rushed to the return flight the next morning, so I chose to stay here.
I was afraid of living near the airport because I was afraid that the sound of aircraft taking off and landing would be too noisy and affect sleep.
But the soundproofing effect of this house is a bit beyond my expectations. I can't say that there is no sound at all, but the TV sound in the room is not loud (the TV sound is only two or three bars), so I slept until dawn and had a good rest. .
The hotel has five extra pillows to choose from, and it is recommended to have one more rose pillow.
I like the fragrance and toiletries in the room, and the toilet is separated from wet and dry.
If you take Air China or Shenzhen Airlines, you can check in directly at the hotel. If you don’t have checked luggage, you can go through the security check and board directly here. This is especially convenient. The check-in counter starts at 6:30 in the morning. If you live here, you can also walk directly to Hongqiao Railway Station.
If you walk a certain distance, you will find Hongqiao Heaven and Earth, where you can eat, drink and have fun, and there are also places for business banquets.

I thought it was very close, and it was said to be in the airport, but Didn't expect it to be so close, and if you checked in. You can board the plane directly. They have VIP access. The room is clean and the service is in place. If you have any questions, the front desk will ask them carefully and solve them. You can see the plane from the room. There is no sound at all. Have a good sleep. Yes, you can't hear it at all, like me😂 As for those who don't sleep well, they have to be seriously bad. Generally, you can't hear it when you are asleep. I didn't buy breakfast this time. I will book one with breakfast next time. Post this **, I really need more people to know about it. It’s so convenient and the price is definitely reasonable for Shanghai. It will be the only choice for departure from Shanghai Hongqiao in the future👍

The disadvantage is that there are no windows, so sound insulation is good. Suitable for those who do not stay in Hongqiao for a long time.
Here is a special talk about breakfast, which is quite good. I personally like smoked salmon very much, so I am very satisfied.
Perhaps because of the epidemic, the price/performance ratio has been very good recently.

Miss Fang at the front desk heard that children like airplanes and upgraded them to a room where you can see the plane taking off. The experience couldn't be better. Before, in order to let children watch the plane, I also specially booked Shenzhen Airport Hyatt, but I can only see it from the corner of the balcony, where I can watch from the oversized glass window without blind spots. The child is fascinated by it and refuses to go out to eat.
There are surprises when you get up early, and you can see the super beautiful sunrise in bed.
It was originally a temporary hotel for catching a plane, but I didn't expect it to be better than a parent-child resort hotel.
Other facilities in the hotel are also superb. There is a separate VIP passage through the security check, which is especially convenient for bringing the elderly and children. It is seamlessly connected to the terminal building, but the room is not very noisy, and the soundproofing is very good.

On the 25th, in Shanghai, because the typhoon flights were all cancelled, I went to the hotel directly after arriving at Hongqiao. The location is very good to find, as long as I go up to the third floor to the departure floor, the hotel is very luxuriously decorated, and the lady at the front desk is also very good, because it is a person who set the flight room. I thought it was not big, but I went upstairs and found that it was much bigger than I thought. The temperature in the room has been kept at around 24 degrees, so I will feel cold when I open the door. The room is very clean, the infrastructure is not lacking, there are drinks and snacks, toiletries can be brought by myself. If you don't have it, you can ask for a copy at the front desk. The room can be called food, Western and Chinese food have, the price is moderate, not very cheap but not expensive outrageous, interject, fried rice to eat well help. Last but not least, the bed was so ****ing comfortable... Yesterday, I got back from Beijing in the morning, and thought about taking a break in the afternoon and going out at night. I couldn't get up when I lay down. The mattress thief was comfortable, the quilt was just thick, the pillow was soft, I loved the bed. In addition to the perfect hard conditions, the location is also a big advantage. Out of the lobby is the airport. It took me about ten minutes to go into the security check. Then B1 You can take the subway, you can take the bus on the first floor, and it only takes a few minutes to walk to Hongqiao Railway Station. Nothing else. Come and live!

酒店服務也是很好，不會過度也不會冷淡，剛剛好，哈哈。以後會給朋友也推薦這個酒店噠。

還有房間內沒有梳洗用品，需要的話去前台索取；不過我知道這個可能是上海市政府規定，所以我是明白和接受的。

msg:5月4日晚上10點飛抵浦東機場，直接預訂了攜程接機，一路暢通，但到酒店也快12點了。司機沒有直接停到虹橋機場的T2，而是按照導航到了酒店後面的停車場，卻進不了停車場，進退兩難。問了保安，讓我們就在那裡下車，從停車場走進去，坐電梯到4樓的大堂。
辦理完入住，前台小妹説從那個黑門框那裡坐電梯。我們走到黑門框，卻不是電梯，邊上才是。坐下去，覺得不太對，再上來走到黑門框的另一邊的電梯坐下去，還有半層樓梯。我們提着很重的行李箱，為難之際，剛好碰到一位熱心的中年工作人員，帶我們到員工電梯，坐到2樓。
我訂的主樓豪華雙床房，房間挺大，35-40㎡；但房間的隔音效果非常差，半夜上廁所，沖水的轟鳴聲持續不斷，又聽到樓上房間搬動東西的聲音，如果睡眠不佳的人恐怕是難以入睡的。好在玩累了，關上廁所的門，很快就睡著了。
第二天退房，直接就走到出發大廳，這確實是這家酒店的極大優勢。辦完登機手續，看到有一家一風堂拉麪，去年在京都，太太吃了他家的特辣拉麪念念不忘，於是坐下來吃早飯，兩碗拉麪160元，不過給料還是挺足的，味道也不錯。其實，吉祥航空的這趟航班是有餐食供應的，但回國後還能吃到一風堂，還是值得的。
總之，這家酒店除了轉機過夜方便，其它方面乏善可陳，假如不是趕早班的航班，似乎沒有必要住在那裡。

msg:房間設備什麼的都挺好的，設計簡潔乾淨，也很寬敞舒適。
就是通風系統受機場通風系統限制，3月那會兒沒法開空調，房間無窗有點熱，不過酒店也送了個電風扇過來，問題也解決得比較好。
最大的優勢是酒店有獨立的vip安檢口，過了小門就能安檢！離登機閘口也沒多少距離，住店比外面進來確實省了最起碼半個小時的時間。
下次送朋友離滬，還定這家！

1. 入住和退房都在前台，排隊隊伍沒有具體劃分，入住排隊久也就算了，退房也要排隊等半天。

2. 酒店沒什麼吃的，衹有叫外賣，外賣需要自己下樓拿，高峯期全部堆在禮賓台桌子上，很不方便。

3. 房間設施老舊，頂噴水壓不夠，手持噴頭感覺不太乾淨。吹風機風力太小，不知道是壞了還是就這樣，沒有熱風衹有冷風和常温風。

總結：雖然酒店就在機場裏面，但總體而言也沒方便到哪裡去，下次不會再住。

設施不算新，但也沒有很舊，起碼乾淨衞生是保證的。可能是機場酒店的原因，前台美女地道的英語還是讓人感覺挺好的（雖然跟我沒什麼關係，但聽着很舒服），沒訂早餐，在T2吃的，不評論。對了，主動問了小朋友有沒有帶洗漱用品，並且送到房間，這點挺好。
總的來説對這個價格來説，還是超值的。畢竟出門到值機櫃枱就幾步路。對高鐵來虹橋，第二天早班機的人，實在是比較友好。

不過酒店工作人員非常不錯，帶我們不斷的嘗試各層客房的房間體感，最終換到了較為涼快的房間

唯一不足的是，我晚上9點之後到的，出租車不能到T2出發層下客了，衹能去酒店停車場。但我行李很多，到了停車場要上三樓大堂很麻煩。
幸運的是遇到一位酒店工作人員，迅速打電話讓人下來幫我搬行李。
整個入住期間酒店的工作人員給人的感覺都是工作態度非常好。
已經將這個酒店推薦給好幾位朋友了。

平心而論，雖然酒店方態度很誠懇，也積極補救，但這樣的經歷着實令人不悦，不會再去光顧了。

這旅館位於T2，若要到T1搭飛機，衹有早晨6點後有地鐵可銜接，再早衹能打車，車程約10分鐘，費用比一般時間貴2-3倍，很不划算，選擇時要考慮一下。
