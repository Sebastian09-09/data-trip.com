The indoor Chinese cultural elements are used more comprehensively, with attention to detail. The service is quite thoughtful. The staff wears Hanfu and is quite enthusiastic. It is separated from the city by a fast road and is a relatively independent hotel. If you like the environment and quietness, this hotel is worth recommending.

msg:Great efforts have been made in hotel inves**ent and design. Every penny should be spent. The facilities and equipment are complete. The lobby is luxurious and classy. It is easy to take photos and check in. There is a desk, a double bathroom, a small yard and everything in the room. There is also a wardrobe. I directly paired it with two sets of basic Hanfu. The effect is pretty good and can be worn directly to take photos. Based on the above, there are no direct negative reviews, mainly because the hotel investors spent so much money. I spent so much money on the design of this hotel, but the details and services are completely out of step with it. It‚Äôs really a pity. It confirms the saying ‚ÄúA person who travels a hundred miles is half a mile‚Äù: First of all, the room is equipped with a bookcase, and there is a scripture on the bookcase. The paper was provided for guests to copy, but when they checked in, the paper had been half-written by the previous guest and had not been replaced. What is even more amazing is that a small-font paper note was paired with a large-sized fountain pen. The quality of the pen It's very poor and the pen doesn't match the paper at all. It's impossible to write at all. Maybe most guests come just to show off... Secondly, the room is equipped with a smart toilet and light sensor, but I encountered a problem on the second floor. The sensor light in the bathroom couldn't be turned off. I called the guest room aunt at 1 a.m. and spent a long time studying it before I figured out how to close the bathroom door. When I woke up in the morning, the smart toilet on the first floor leaked and my trousers were wet... There is a tea set in the room. Where is the tea? Is this tea set also a decoration? Maybe you matched it and I didn‚Äôt find it, but I‚Äôve already called the service number n times after checking in for one night, and I‚Äôm too embarrassed to ask again. For such a good hotel, I really recommend that you learn from the high-end resort hotels in Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai. What is fine management and fine service? Tens of millions of dollars in decoration are not saved, a few yuan of tea and small soft drinks are not given up, and the service staff is almost useless. The mood and expression were stiff. Unlike other hotels I stayed in, I felt very polite and warm when greeting each other. (When I entered the store, the people who greeted me at the door were super enthusiastic, but they were not the ones who greeted me. Hahaha, it‚Äôs really nice. Embarrassing, it should be the leaders of the hotel or the catering side who greet the important VIPs), so it‚Äôs not that I won‚Äôt, I just don‚Äôt want to... If I were your boss, I would have these managers stand at the door 24 hours a day.

Inside the residence, everything is spotless and everything is in order. The windows are bright and clean, and the light shines brightly, as if entering a fairyland or a beautiful garden. The decorations on the four walls are quaint and simple, and the charm of the Han style is clearly visible to the eyes.

As for the court food, it is extremely delicious and moderately rich. Food from China and the West, as well as flavors from the North and South, are included. I tasted the pancakes, which were crispy but not burnt, sweet and delicious, and left me with endless aftertaste. There is also the local delicacy Roujiamo, which is smooth but not greasy and full of flavor.

As for the service, it can be described as attentive and meticulous. The waiters are all affable, respectful and courteous. All questions will be answered, all requests will be answered, and every detail will be taken care of.

In the quiet night, there is no noise or commotion, only the sound of insects can be heard, like the rhythm of harp and harp. This is where I rest my body, where my heart rests.

She is not the kind who wants you to give a good review just after checking in. Nowadays, hotels are very popular. In order to give good reviews, in many cases, the room is very clean and feels very warm. The room automation is controllable and user-friendly. The lights turn on before people arrive, and the toilet has an electric flip-up lid. It is a good experience. It feels like it's not the peak season now. The hotel price is not expensive and only costs over RMB 500 including two breakfasts. Today I stayed in a lake view room with a park behind me. It snowed heavily in Xi'an today and the scenery was particularly beautiful. Breakfast is the best I have cooked in so many hotels. There are not many dishes but they are delicious.

After returning home, I found that I had left my facial cleanser and shampoo at the hotel, and the hotel did not proactively contact me to inform me. I was too busy to follow up, so there was no contact. Although it is not a valuable item, if you stay in a five-star hotel elsewhere, even if you leave a data cable behind, the hotel will take the initiative to contact you after the ward checküòÉ

Location: The location is at the corner of the northwest corner of the second ring road. It is very convenient to drive there. The hotel has its own parking lot, which is also very convenient. If you take the bus, take the Second Ring Road Line 1, Line 2, 901, 211 and get off at Dafengge Station. That is, there is the Dafeng Pavilion in the Hancheng Lake Scenic Area next to the hotel, which is also more suitable for a stroll.

Facilities: The facilities of the hotel are quite advanced. The room has a separate cloakroom and sensor lights, which is very convenient! The toilet is a smart toilet! The experience is great. I live in a loft, there are two bathrooms upstairs and downstairs, which is really convenient. There is no need to worry about the air conditioner on the second floor. The room is centrally air-conditioned, and the cooling effect is great! The large curtains on the floor-to-ceiling windows are electric, which is also very convenient.

Environment: The environment of the hotel is very clean and the rooms are large. The entire hotel enters the gate to see the sculptures of the Silk Road, and then to the heavy textured lobby door! The feeling of traveling through history, hahahaha, is really there. There is also a chime bell in the lobby, which is really shocking, and there are quite a lot of details in the hotel.

Hanfu experience (basic model only): By the way, the package for staying in the room also includes Hanfu wearing experience! We didn't experience this service because we were in a hurry. We must experience it next time we go to the hotel.

The ladies at the front desk, Li Jie and Lei Jiao, were very enthusiastic. They helped me take a lot of photos during the Hanfu experience, thank you very much! The children were playing with toys on the ground, and the aunt who was planning to be hygienic even left a small note by hand, very touched! Next time you come to Xi'an, you must stay at the Hanyuefu Hotel.

It‚Äôs not good at all. I didn‚Äôt buy a room with two breakfasts. If I bought it separately later, it would cost 108 per person. It‚Äôs equivalent to having a buffet outside. It‚Äôs three or four times more expensive than booking a room with two breakfasts in advance. I really don‚Äôt understand.

We honestly detoured on the first afternoon I walked away, and walked around again the next morning, but when I walked to the back of the hotel, I found that the door of the restaurant was wide open, and I could directly enter the first floor of the hotel. I really want to say, God horse stuff! In addition, no one cares about the free afternoon tea and Hanfu experience, and I don‚Äôt bother to ask, I haven‚Äôt experienced it, in short, I will never go there again.

msg:The hotel is located in the Seoul Lake Park, a few kilometers away from the Big Wild Goose Pagoda, Evernight City, Muslim Street, and the ancient city wall, but I think üâëÔ∏è.
Seoul Lake is very clean and quiet. It has enough oxygen and is the first choice for people with insomnia.
If you have enough time, you can arrange a day in the hotel and park, as well as cruise service. This hotel is full of Chinese culture, Guzheng, Guqin, Hanfu, calligraphy, and classical dance.
The service at the front desk was good. I was told that I was afraid of mosquitoes and gave the children a mosquito repellent bracelet.
There are not many varieties of breakfast, but they taste good. Pick up at 10 o'clock.
The Chinese food in the hotel is also made very carefully, and it feels partial to Shanghai cuisine.

The price of the Chinese restaurant is not cheap, the average main menu items are 108,158,238 and the like, but the taste is really good value for money. After eating for a few days, there is basically no dish that is too thunderous, all of which are good. highly recommended.

msg:The hotel is in the Seoul Lake Park. If the schedule is not too tight, you can get better in the park; the hotel‚Äôs architecture and decoration style is very distinctive, people who advocate ethnic style should like it very much; there are welcome fruits, but they will arrive later. The guests are undoubtedly rainy in time.

msg:The hotel is okay, but the breakfast is unsatisfactory. On a business trip, people who wake up in the morning will be late. As soon as 9:20, several waiters in the restaurant start to take basins, pack their own meals and hide them in the staff studio. 28 They started to tell us that they wanted to collect the meals, and asked us to add and collect the meals. It was just after 30 that all the meals were collected. Star hotels only focus on service details, and this alone makes people feel uncomfortable. And It's like this every day for several days in a row.
