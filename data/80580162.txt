The service is very considerate
For dining, we ordered a set meal for four people for dinner, which was delicious
There is a coffee machine downstairs in the B&B. If you like coffee, you can at least order a latte, which is better than other B&Bs
A suggestion is to install a mobile phone holder in the toilet

Needless to say, the hotel environment is surrounded by tea mountains, cherry blossom forests, and green maple forests. The hotel has a different view at every step. The swimming pool and palm trees make me feel like I'm in the south. We barbecued on the lawn and boiled tea around the stove, while the dog played freely beside us! Every morning, you can take the dog to the back mountain hiking trail for a walk! The owner and staff of the hotel are very, very friendly! Amiable! When leaving, the Border Collie baby was really reluctant!

The service is also very good, with afternoon tea and tea break, and the little brother also delivered it to our room.
The most important point is that it is pet-friendly, give it a thumbs up!
The only drawback is that the private bath in the room is outdoors, and there is nothing to block it except the white gauze, so the privacy is a bit poor

The environment of the B&B is very good. The proprietress is very attentive to the business. She wants to add some popular facilities - camping tents, egg roll tables, camping chairs, and lights to create a full a**osphere!
The B&B has all kinds of facilities, including sand pools, crawling mats, and wooden horses for children to play; there are also archery and spinning bikes for adults to play. There are some that I may not have discovered yet.
I found a hidden path that extends to a very far place. Unfortunately, I didn't finish it all. Halfway through, Baozi wanted to sleep, so I went back.
The sunshine was very good during the few days I went there. I drank coffee and basked in the sun in the afternoon, away from the hustle and bustle of the city, and relaxed my body and calmed my mind.
Looking forward to seeing you again next time!

The yard is quite large, and there is a swimming pool outside the balcony. It should be nice to come in the summer, and you can stroll in the yard.

The restaurant is small and warm, and it feels almost like eating at home. The breakfast is very good, healthy and full.
The service is also very warm and thoughtful. Basically, they are responsive to every request. They are all very kind and easy-going. One night, we packed meals outside and took them to the restaurant to heat them up. They also gave us fruit.

Cave Hot Spring: Because we came to soak in hot springs, we still have to comment. The public hot spring area is indoors, with three hot spring pools. Maybe it is the off-season now, and there are not many people soaking, or they may be staggered. There is a dressing room, which is quite convenient.

There seems to be nothing fun nearby. I went out and didn‚Äôt find anything fun.
Overall, I am very satisfied with this stay and I will go again if I have the chance!
By the way, it is recommended to equip a dryer. It would be great if the clothes can be dried after washing.
There are also two cats that are very cute and can be stroked at will. They are very well behaved.

Hygiene: Hygiene is relatively OK. I just hope that the cigarette butts in the yard can be cleaned up before the next check-in. It would be even better if the floor in the room can be mopped.

My friend‚Äôs reason is that not only the environment and facilities here are perfect, but the proprietress and housekeeper are considerate and enthusiastic, and he also emphasizes that the Feng Shui here is the best among the B&Bs and hotels he has seen. After he found out here, he has already arranged the company's important business reception and team building here.
       Although I don't know Feng Shui, I was still amazed by the overall environment of this homestay after I checked in (see the picture to talk). From the surrounding mountains and rivers, the architectural style of the garden to the small vegetation landscaping, swimming pools, hot springs, and interior furnishings, all of them make people feel comfortable and comfortable. Before leaving, I finally found an opportunity to communicate with the boss in detail about the reasons for choosing Feng Shui here. I understand the natural reasons for the gentle breeze hidden in the garden, the fragrance of sweet-scented osmanthus in all seasons, and the absence of mosquitoes in summer. Experienced good Feng Shui not only makes the host prosperous, but also makes the guests feel natural and comfortable.
       Originally, I never commented, but I was so satisfied that I made an exception. This trip is worthwhile, and there will be a period later!

There are no hot springs in the sense of our tourists' common sense. The boss built a rockery in the courtyard, and built three pools with irregular shapes in the rockery. He called himself a karst cave hot spring, which was a gimmick. There are neither caves nor hot springs. When we went there, the largest pool was about 20-30 square meters without water, the middle pool had warm water marked 41.5 degrees, and the small pool had cold water marked 26 degrees. There were no lights in the rainy bathroom and it was pitch black. To be honest, the other facilities, environment, meals, and service attitude of the B&B are very good, but the hypocrisy of the hot spring covers up all the other good things.

The only thing that needs to be improved is that the breakfast tastes good, but the type is still at the level of ordinary homestays.

msg:The night view in the hotel yard is still good, maybe because of the weather, there are very few guests staying, so the whole environment is very quiet and comfortable. The service is still good. There are security guards to help us with our luggage. The attitude of the service staff is also very good. They will take us to the room and show us other room types. You can also hear insects and the sound of raindrops hitting the ground. The room with the yard is really a good choice. Although the breakfast is a bit small, the taste is not bad. The extra poached eggs will also be made fresh. But there are still a few things that need to be improved 1. There is no full-length mirror in the room, which is very inconvenient. You can't see it by yourself when you match the clothes. 2. There is no small trash can on the sink in the bathroom. The brand platform looks very messy. 3. There are fallen leaves and small insect bodies floating on the swimming pool. The desire to go into the water will be greatly reduced. I hope these points can be improved as soon as possible.

The bed and pillows are very comfortable, and the pillows can be changed into comfortable styles in the cupboard. Dyson hair dryer and ora2 toothpaste used in the room.
The service is good, the housekeepers can answer questions at any time, and you can also go to the front desk to take board games back to the room to play ~ there is also a free mahjong table to use, our family of four is just right
There are two (I only see these two) cats at the front desk, so cute!
Areas that can be improved: the breakfast variety is indeed very small, very general; the swimming pool can prepare a few more swimming laps, which is not enough when there are many people in the swimming pool.
Overall it was a good stay experience!

The only fly in the oin**ent is that the water pressure in the bath is too low, and it may be a bit cold in cold weather. The view is super good! It is no exaggeration to take a step by step and every room around the swimming pool should look beautiful! The staff is very good, they will tell us where there are delicious restaurants, and they will prepare umbrellas for us when it is about to rain. The location is convenient, you can go up the mountain, there is a 5-minute drive from Jialebi Paradise and a 20-minute drive from the museum. Great for families. There are not many types of breakfast, but there are some. I will come again, I am used to staying in brand hotels, but I like this lovely homestay so much!

As soon as you entered, you opened the car door and the security guy came over, took your luggage and sent it to the lobby for check-in. After I arrived, I checked in very quickly and the front desk sent it to me again. The bathroom toilet and shower at the door of the room are separated from wet and dry, which is very good. The hotel's swimming pool is open all day this season. In autumn and winter, there will be a hot spring project. There is also a water park a few hundred meters away. There is a row of restaurants a few hundred meters away from the gate. Turn right and 500 meters away. The restaurant has skewers in the evening, which is very convenient. If you want to eat more, you can just go to the center of Anji County, about eight kilometers away. You can find everything in the whole street... The other thing that makes me write a review is to put on my watch after taking a shower after swimming in the hotel. I put it in the bathroom after checking out at noon. I just went to the next door a few hundred meters to eat (the lady who runs the late-night cafeteria is very enthusiastic and the taste is good). I received a call from the customer service saying that a guest in the cleaning depar**ent had lost something. Then I discovered that the watch was left in the room and was not occupied. If you already have this, you can see that the hotel is doing a good job. I am a person who never writes reviews. The service of the hotel allowed me to solve all my worries. Thanks again to the hotel's cleaning aunt, the front desk guy and the security guy! If you want to relax on vacation, purify your soul, and escape the summer heat, choose this hotel! Also, I‚Äôll see if I have time to go there again in the winter!

I guess it was the wooden bedside and wardrobe, and there was no ventilation for a long time, so the smell could not be dissipated. . The shower room was running too slowly. The sound insulation of the room is not very good. We live on the first floor. Walking upstairs in the middle of the night, we can hear things falling to the ground. A group of people chatting in the yard at night. If you want to rest well, it is recommended to choose a room far away from the swimming pool.
The service of the staff is very good and the attitude is very warm. The location of the hotel is very close to nearby attractions. Breakfast is buffet, but there are too few varieties, few staple foods, and basically no meat. Dinner needs to be booked in advance, 150 adults. Maybe it was peak season when we went, and the price/performance ratio was slightly lower.

The layout of the courtyard is very particular. It can be seen that a lot of thought has been spent, and it is very good to shoot casually. On the day we came, the housekeepers and sisters were all planting flowers in the yard. When I asked, I realized that they were all planted by themselves, which is amazingüëç
The rooms are full of smart homes, and the bedding is also very comfortable. When you wake up, there are bursts of birdsong outside the window, which is really unprecedented in the city.
In addition, I want to say a magical thing: I have had allergic rhinitis for many years, and my nose has never been blocked since I arrived at Junde. Next to it is Lingfeng Temple, a thousand-year-old temple. It may really be a feng shui treasure. Next time, I will bring my family together!

msg:It was relatively quiet. My son was injured in a ski fall. I asked the housekeeper if he had Yunnan Baiyao. There was a first aid kit at the front desk, and the supplies were complete. In the morning, the proprietress returned the medicine and asked if it was a problem, whether I needed a bandage or not. It was very heartwarming. We settled for a different courtyard, which is closer to the inside, so it is relatively clean. In the morning, there were workers working near us, and then they left immediately when they found out that someone was living there. When I checked out, the proprietress also apologized to me and said that the workers didn‚Äôt know that the room was occupied. I‚Äôm sorry, but I also sent a bag of snacks and water when I checked out.

The rooms and facilities are brand new. All the service staff of the most important hotel are very warm and considerate, making guests feel at home. Although the room is not big, it is clean, with terrace, comfortable bed, and very quiet at night. We ate in Jun De Yuxiu‚Äôs own restaurant for three days. The restaurant can order meals according to the time of the guests. Different dishes are arranged every day. The chef‚Äôs craftsmanship is very good, the breakfast is also very hearty, and the meat wontons are delicious. The location here is very convenient, 15 minutes to Longwangxi, 5 minutes to Lingfeng Mountain Scenic Area. In short, our experience was amazing and will be here.

The weather was good on the weekend. We took the dog to Anji to play. We were really lucky to find this place. The dog had a good time. All the staff were super friendly and enthusiastic. The lady at the front desk and the butler were gentle and lovely. Saying goodbye like an old friend, I felt reluctant to leave after staying in a hotel for the first time. . .
The dog is jumping around on the lawn, the sweet-scented osmanthus in the yard is fragrant, reading a book, drinking a cup of coffee, it feels really great, and it should be very suitable for parents and children.

I will definitely play in the past often in the future~

msg:On National Day, bring friends and their parents out to play. This hotel is a very trendy hotel, because the various environments are very good, and it is very different from other B&Bs I have stayed in before. It feels like the ceiling in Anji Homestay.
Room: The room is in a relatively simple muji style, mainly made of bamboo and wood furniture, which is relatively clean. Very functional, smart toilet, air-conditioning and floor heating. Equipped with a mosquito repellent lamp and a universal socket. There are free drinks and daily snacks in the small refrigerator.
Geographical location: For driving, I got off the highway and it was about 20 kilometers away. The specific number of kilometers is slightly different. A few hundred meters away, there are small bars, Internet celebrity coffee shops and some restaurants are very convenient.
Meals: Breakfast and dinner reservations. There are also many types of breakfast, full and rich.
Service attitude: It has been online for nearly a month, the waiters are very kind, and there are staff on duty at night. Greet customers as if they were family members, and all their needs were resolved quickly. Internal consumption can be considered reasonable.
Internal environment: There are many green plants, Internet celebrity swimming pool, barbecue area, and hot spring pavilion. I don't want to go out when I live in a hotel. It feels like being exclusive in Southeast Asia.
Basically it was pretty good, and I had a pleasant hotel stay experience.
 By the way, this is a hotel that welcomes dogs. Dogs are not allowed when eating in the restaurant, and the owner will personally help take care of them. Improved user experience!

Miss sister gave a pack of mosquito repellent stickers haha. Consider that the mosquito repellent care package at Hoshino Tendaiyama Kasuke Hotel costs 500. . The hotel has a very beautiful swimming pool, and breakfast is a light farmhouse style. There are not many varieties but it is very healthy.

msg:I didn't like to go to crowded places on the National Day. In the past years, Xinjiang and Sanya have been to popular attractions many times. This time, Anji was specially selected as a place to heal tiredness. After repeatedly comparing many homestays and hotels, I finally chose this five-star homestay. I never thought it exceeded my expectations!
       Before I arrived at the hotel, the housekeeper was very close to the group. If you have any questions, please ask her at any time. The housekeeper is very nice. If I trouble you, they delivered things in time. They are heart-warming young ladies and young brothers. NS. Let‚Äôs talk about the experience:
       First of all, although this homestay is not big, it has complete facilities, with a 24-hour outdoor swimming pool, a flower garden, and a hot spring! The buildings are well-spaced and sound insulation is good. Even though I have stayed in several families with children this holiday, I am still not disturbed, and I still feel like I am living in the fragrance of birds and flowers. Especially worth mentioning is the outdoor swimming pool. Thanks to the privacy of the homestay, there are not many people in the swimming pool. When I chose to go for a swim at 11 am, I dominated the entire swimming pool by myself. The experience was great! Compared with the indoor standard swimming pools of many five-star hotels, it is much more natural and comfortable~
       Secondly, the room layout here is spacious, the view is excellent, and the various details particularly touched me. This time I experienced the evening cherry room. In addition to the tatami mats, the room has a direct view of the garden, and there is also a terrace, where you can drink coffee in the early morning and blow the air. The supplies in the room are basically at least the standard of Park Hyatt. It is hard to imagine that they are provided by a B&B, including Dyson‚Äôs hair dryer, Ariete‚Äôs kettle, Japanese wide-head toothbrush, Ora‚Äôs toothpaste, Apllela‚Äôs cleaning, etc. It is impossible to save costs. When I enter the house, I worry that the owner of the hotel may lose money because of this cost...
       Finally, I want to talk about catering. The homestay has its own set meals and standard meals. There are also Internet celebrity restaurants such as Jin Mom and Dad‚Äôs Kitchen nearby. I have experienced these two days. In contrast, Junde‚Äôs meals are more natural, the seasoning is healthy, and there are a lot of home-grown vegetables and ingredients, and there is a refreshing feeling of coming here to experience three meals. The sauerkraut fish and taro cakes I had for dinner on the first day were amazing. The ingredients and cooking skills complemented each other. There is also Xiaoyin Village nearby, which is only a short walk away. In the afternoon, I went to the next door to read a book and drink tea and coffee. I heard that the hotel has free afternoon tea at 2-4 pm. I haven't eaten it because of the itinerary, so I will try it next time. But a very enthusiastic proprietress invited us to taste the sweet potato chips, it was really delicious, and bought the sweet potato chips and white tea to give away!
       All in all, it was a very satisfying stay experience, and I couldn't bear it when I left. Come back next time when you plan to open the hot springs in November!

Lunch and dinner can be booked, there is a set meal with side dishes, the cooking is good! There is afternoon tea every day. There is a small bar where you can order coffee and cocktails. Drinking by the pool in the evening and watching the stars is great.

The mattresses are very comfortable, the water pressure is high, the bathrooms are all toto, the parking lot is in the yard, and there is a hot spring in the winter!
