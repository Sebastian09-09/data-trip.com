One small shampoo for three people. Unfortunately I will not choose this hotel again. The hotel does not look like 5*.

msg:I booked the hotel to spend the New Year‚Äôs Eve. We arrived there at 12:00 am to make check in because it‚Äôs normal in China to make early check in. The reception attendant said that the room was not ready, we needed to wait until 14:00. Ok, we came back at 14:10. Waited in a long line to make check in. In the end the receptionist said that the room was still not ready, asked us to wait more 30 minutes. At 15:00 we were able to enter the room. Seems like the reason for this problem was over booking, but the hotel is a 5 star hotel, I expected a better treatment. They didn‚Äôt offer anything to apologize. Apart of it, the room is good, nice view.

The service is very friendly and responsible.
There are only some points down about the breakfast, and the top floor restaurant with stunning view on Shanghai is rather dull as well

The breakfast was pretty bad, I went 9:00 with the thought it might be less busy, but the food was all empty, no coffee cups, to beacon, etc. I would not recommend anyone to book this hotel via trip, or at all.

Strange smell in the hall way, strange smell in the bathroom from the sink.

I expect from a 5-Star hotel to get seated when I enter the breakfast in the morning. 4 people of the staff where checking my room number but no one said ‚Äúgood morning‚Äù or ‚Äúhello‚Äù.

Breakfast was below average for 5 Star hotel.

Conclusion: I would not book it again due to: just not worth the price

msg:First of all, we were greeted by the cold faces of the staff, who did not even greet us. The room we were given is very different from the pictures in the hotel description. A tiny window in the corner.  Very dirty.  It smells like moisture.  Dirty walls, dirty furniture with suspicious white spots.  It's scary to sit on such a dirty chair. (See photo) The room has a transparent window between the toilet and the bedroom, so if you come with a partner, be prepared for him to watch you poop.  We asked for a room change, but the staff were impolite, cold and boorish.  In general the hotel is very old and not worth the money asked for it.  Disgusting service and condition of rooms.  I recommend to rent a room in any other hotel in the same neighborhood, of which there are so many.

msg:The location is absolutely perfect. Right across the street from the subway. Located within walking of many popular streets with good restaurants. The bed was comfortable and the room was suitable. However, the bathroom stunk like sewer my whole 2 weeks staying here. The sink gurgled all day/night too. The service was not so good. The people at the front are not friendly or helpful. The hotel has a business office, however, they charge a ridiculous amount per copy. I needed some important documents printed and it cost me about $10 to simply print 6 documents. Then, the documents were completely unusable with black streaks up each side and the print quality was very dark. The hotel did not care. I paid my money and that was what I got. This is a 2.5 Star at the most. It "appears" to be a nice fancy hotel, but looking closely, it's not. I would have better service at a small hostel where they care a little more. Save your money and go somewhere else.

msg:Convenient location to large shopping district with walking-distance access to cafes, bars and restaurants.  A metro station is literally across the street.  The hotel can be quite inconvenient if arriving by car as surrounding roads are narrow and can become quite congested at peak times.  Room was of good size for Shanghai, with bed, desk, sofa, coffee table, and bar.  Hot water and heating was minimal: there‚Äôs no danger of burning yourself or having to open the window to cool down. Internet speed was slow and made streaming video frustrating.  Breakfast was rather poor quality and selection for a price of 190rmb.  You can get better for less in some of the nearby restaurants.  No issues with service, though apart from check-in there was no need to speak to staff.  Overall, a rather unremarkable experience.  If returning to this area, I would try another hotel.

We were given rooms on different floors until we complained, then miraculously they found adjoining rooms. Rooms were smelly (musty and faint sewage from bathroom) and there were stains on couch. ABSOLUTELY NO EXECUTIVE SERVICES (lounge closed even though we asked before booking): no working areas, no separate eating arrangement, and we even paid 30 RMB to print three pages. Room cards stopped working three times during our stay. Last: no greeting upon arrival or departure, no help with luggage either into/out of hotel, to the rooms. Almost all hospitality staff indifferent to our needs.

msg:We weren't overly impressed with the hotel, for the price. When we arrived they claimed we had booked a king room even though our booking on trip showed a twin panoramic, they 'fixed' it for us, although it was theor mistake. The room was small, the view was ok, we could see the pearl in the distance but not the best view I've had in Shanghai.
When we arrived the bathroom door was broken, so we had to wait for maintenance to fix it, they didn't offer to give us a new room. The room needs some work, I think there is an issue with the AC so the room was damp, and it smells damp, as well as the bedding etc. feeling slightly damp if the ac is left on all day. There are old water marks on the top of the walls and everything just looks a bit old. The beds were comfy, I asked for a hard pillow and was given a buckwheat one but the sleep was alright. They give tea and coffee and water. The housekeeping staff were excellent.
The shower is ok, although quite low down so no good if you're tall. The edge of the bath is quite wide so it's difficult to get in and out of, especially if you have mobility issues.
It's right opposite the subway for line 13 and a few mins walk from line 1 so thats good although both lines close around 11pm. Theres a few convenience stores around and a decent amount of food places etc. It's close to the French concession and the 158 food place.
We didn't try the restaurant as it was a little expensive but the view from the restaurant was very good.
A lot of their little shops were closed, or they only open from 12-4 or stuff like that (end of June 2021).
Overall it was ok but not worth the money, I think next time we'd stay closer to Nanjing Road.

I couldn't adjust the temperature, I could only turn it on and off. I didn't know how the quilt was put on. The inner core was all outside. There were stains on the sofa. There was no charging port on the bedside table. I wanted to sleep for a while at around 9 o'clock in the morning when I was traveling outside. I clearly turned on the Do Not Disturb prompt, but the waiter kept knocking on the door saying hello. Can I sleep? Moreover, the hotel lobby is very new, but the room is very old. There are stains on the paper on the table, which makes people feel uncomfortable and disgusting. There was a piece of paper on the floor when I opened the door of my room. The sanitary conditions were extremely poor. I don't know if they deliberately arranged this room for me or what. The mirror faces the bed. The bathroom is next to the bed. There is a curtain in the bathroom, but it is transparent. I don't know what it is for. This room is scary. The most disgusting and terrifying hotel I have ever stayed in.

Service: The front desk service is warm and thoughtful, the check-in procedure is fast, and they can actively answer questions.
Room: The equipment and facilities feel old. I bought food that needs to be refrigerated, but the refrigerator does not cool. After feedback, I proposed a solution as soon as possible. The next day, I called the guest room to remind them to replace the refrigerator (the cooling effect is still not good after the replacement. Can the room equipment be checked?)
Breakfast: There are many people eating and you need to wait for a seat. There are few breakfast categories and few options. The chef‚Äôs service is indifferent. I reminded the service staff that the coffee machine is not working and the residue needs to be cleaned. The fruit is gone and needs to be replenished. In return, there are more than 500 guests today... There is no follow-up here
Children's playground: Basic disinfection and cleaning should not be done. The ground is messy, with visible paper scraps and plastic film, which is very unfriendly to children.

Later one day before going to bed, I found many small black spots on the quilt for unknown reasons. The staff also communicated with the cleaning staff very quickly and sent a new set up. The service was very good, warm and considerate.

The hotel breakfast was great, with both Chinese and Western food, very rich.

The surrounding environment is good and very convenient, opposite the subway station. There are all kinds of food, drinks and entertainment nearby, and shopping is also convenient. It was a very satisfactory stay.

msg:Located on Huaihai Road and Changle Road, in a relatively prosperous area, next to the subway entrance of Line 13. It is free to park in the hotel parking lot when taking children to the Natural History Museum. It is only 2 stops away by subway, which is very convenient. It took more than ten minutes to check in at the hotel. There are many steps and it is quite cumbersome. I have stayed in many hotels. It is also an eye-opener to ask for a responsibility letter to be signed for the first time with a child. However, the service attitude is good, so it is acceptable. The hotel charges a deposit of 500 per room for check-in, which is also rare. The whole feeling is that it is still the old-fashioned way of doing things, which is a little behind the times. The hotel facilities are the same. It was built in 1990 and renovated in 10 years. The internal facilities have the feeling of a 5-star hotel in the last century. Fortunately, the maintenance is OK and the hygiene is not bad. The only thing is that there is only a bathtub in the bathroom, which is inconvenient to climb in and out, and the toilet always feels like it needs to be cleaned. It feels like it's falling apart. What I can't stand the most is that the air conditioner can't control the temperature. During the day in April, due to sunlight, the indoor temperature showed 27 degrees, but I adjusted it to 16 degrees and it didn't help. I called the customer service and was told that the air conditioner only sends air and can't adjust the temperature. Either open the window and sign a waiver, or send an electric fan. It seems that I am not the only one who has raised similar questions. It was so hot at night that the whole family didn't cover themselves with quilts. I didn't sleep well all night because of the heat. It was so painful. There was always a sound of equipment running in the corridor, which was more obvious on the sleepless night. I only slept for 4.5 hours a night. But to be honest, all the staff I met were very friendly, so even so, I didn't feel comfortable giving the hotel too low a score. The hotel's breakfast is average. If it's not delivered, don't buy it. I walked around and didn't know where to start. It's better to order takeout.

The housekeeping supervisor came shortly after we checked in. I sent welcome fruits and wish you a happy new year!

msg:During the Spring Festival, I stayed in the hotel with my family for 3 consecutive nights. The New Year's Eve dinner and breakfast for the next 3 days were all eaten in the hotel. The hotel is located in the city center, next to Huaihai Road, and there is a subway exit opposite the hotel, making the transportation very convenient. The facilities of the old hotel are not new, but they are clean and tidy. The room attendants are diligent and quick. The wardrobe hinge is broken, and the maintenance man is called in time.
        The downside is that breakfast was overcrowded and there was a long queue (I have never seen such a spectacular queue before.) The restaurant is cramped, with few seats, and the coffee bar next to it is also open, which is difficult to cope with. The chef complained, the waiter moved out of shape, and the manager on duty helplessly urged the guests to leave early. What was supposed to be a leisurely and relaxing breakfast turned out to be a tense and rushed a**osphere. There should be big data on how many people are staying and how many people are dining, and there should also be a plan. This look really ruins Jinjiang‚Äôs brand.

msg:Facilities:
The facilities are very basic. After all, it is a hotel of some years.
The front desk takes toothbrushes and razors, but there is toothpaste in the room, so there is no need to do this separately.
The air conditioner is not set properly. The room temperature is quite low. If you take a shower, there will be a big temperature difference, which is easy to catch a cold.
The quilt is not thick, just right for one person. The quilt for two people in the double bed room is not enough. The pillow is also relatively flat. I stayed for one night and didn‚Äôt ask the front desk if there are down pillows.
The small bottles of toiletries are solidified and difficult to pour out. They are not very useful.
The gym is not 24 hours.
I booked a room with a view, but the curtains turned out Half of it is a wall, and half is a window. The view is okay. You can see the wall when you look out.

Hygiene:
You can see some traces of time, and the stains can't be removed even after cleaning.

Environment:
Very good, in the city center, Changle Road, but if I have to choose again, I will still choose Garden Hotel.

Service:
No one in the lobby took the initiative to come forward, and the parking security guard would not take the initiative to help. I waited for a long time before someone came to point the direction.
At night, there will be people in the elevator without pressing the elevator to rub the floor. I don't know what they are doing. I feel that the safety needs to be improved.

The price-performance ratio of this hotel is very average. I am disappointed. I probably won't go there a second time.

In order to plug in a plug, one needs to lie down on the ground. The rain shower in the guest room is fixed and it is very inconvenient to take a bath.
There was a pack of coffee in the drawer when I checked in. I don't know if it was provided by the hotel or forgotten by the class guests... In short, it is more like a guesthouse than a five-star hotel.
But the service is still very good, and the room service responded enthusiastically when I called in the middle of the night. The lady at the front desk was also very enthusiastic when checking in and served with a smile throughout.

The disadvantage is that except for the lobby, which looks like a five-star hotel, the facilities can only be regarded as those of a budget hotel, and the service cannot be mentioned.

The facilities are aging and outdated, and the bathing and shampoo products are very low-end. Forget it. What's even worse is the service. It can be said that there is no quality at all.
The staff here didn't smile and spoke in a rude tone. They called the reception desk and hung up as soon as the last word came out.
I will never stay at this hotel again, nor any hotels related to Jinjiang.

Guest room: I stayed on the 8th floor this time. The front desk said it was newly renovated, which is indeed different. The twin room also has separate wet and dry bathrooms, which is indeed better than other twin rooms! The hotel's shampoo and shower gel are all in small disposable bottles, which is clean and hygienic. I like the smell of body lotion very much. The hotel also gave me two packs of Sumida River coffee. My aunt saw that I liked it and gave me an extra pack, haha!
Breakfast: There are many varieties, including Chinese, Western, pasta, and freshly made pancakes and fruits. The taste is also very good. It is worthy of being an old five-star hotel. I feel that after breakfast, I don‚Äôt need to eat lunch. This stay was a very good experience!

It is worth mentioning that the room cleaning lady is very clean and professional. She is also very attentive and makes her smile. Sweet, I have stayed in many five-star hotels, and this is the first time I feel that the cleaning service is worthy of five-star standards. In terms of room facilities, some facilities are slightly outdated due to the age of decoration, but they are very clean and can open windows, which is particularly good. The only drawback is that there is no shower room in the twin room, and the bathtub is inconvenient for the elderly to enter and exit. I hope that in the future You can consider this when renovating.

She said that there were empty rooms nearby, so why not apply for a room if there were empty rooms?

The room is very small and the bathroom cannot be turned around. There was no socket next to the bed, and the air conditioner had no hot or cold settings, so I was woken up by the heat in the middle of the night.

Environment: I made a temporary reservation after having dinner nearby. I thought it was a five-star hotel, but I didn't pay attention to read the reviews. I didn‚Äôt expect such an old hotel to be five-star? ? Apart from the good location, there are no advantages. When it comes to repairing carpets in the corridors of rooms at night, have you ever seen a hotel that still smells like construction at ten o'clock in the evening? The soundproofing is so bad, you can hear everything in the corridor next door upstairs so clearly that your head will explode.

Service: The only thing is that the service is not bad. But after waiting in line for half an hour to check in, there is no so-called Ctrip exclusive channel. Can the efficiency be improved? I was originally going to stay for two days, but after one day I couldn't stand it anymore and so I checked out. It's impossible to stay here again.

It is enough to show the magic city and gentleman style of Shanghai!
The staff are polite and dedicated, and the bed facilities in the room are warm and comfortable!
Especially when the concierge book a "taxi drop off to Pudong Airport",

Then I stepped on something and casually mentioned it to my teammates, but they didn't take it seriously. On September 10th, my teammates stepped on it and bled and called the cleaning lady. After looking at the results, a row of nails were pulled out (Picture 3). Then the hotel suggested that we go to the hospital, but no one accompanied us. We went to the tetanus by ourselves. The hotel did not call to care about the situation. When we came back at 7pm, they said they would change us to a suite. We were assured that this would not happen. As a result, our teammate stepped on a nail again in the new room that night (Picture 1). This time the hotel didn't even want to explain. We didn't want to stay overnight and wanted to move out. As a result, the lobby manager called us. They will give us a satisfactory answer tomorrow and then we will tell them that we want to refund the room fee for 6 days and reimburse all medical expenses. The result we gave me the next day was that I would only be refunded for three days and the cost of upgrading the room. The first three days would not be refunded. The reason for not refunding was that the nail was stepped on on the fourth day. Everything was fine for the first three days, so I had to charge money. What makes us angry is that this room has had safety issues since we checked in. The hotel has always had excuses to accuse us of anything happening. Now we have asked law enforcement agencies to intervene. This tone cannot be tolerated. Family members should be careful when choosing this hotel.

Half a month later, in the middle of the night, it suddenly occurred to me that I had not written the review yet. I still got up and wrote this review with the same anger as at that timeüò°:
1. For a five-star hotel, there is a strong smell of smoke and musty smell as soon as you enter the door. It is very strong! It‚Äôs not like I have a good nose
2. When changing shoes, when you lower your head, there is a fragment of a packaging bag next to it. It is the most basic hygiene and cannot be cleaned even when picking up garbage.
3. The floor of the toilet was full of spots, water stains, and was black and yellow. It was so disgusting that I almost didn‚Äôt take a shower.
4. There is only one bathtub, and it is also full of yellow water stains. It is impossible to get in under 1.5m without lifting your legs, which is especially unfriendly to the elderly and children. And the bathroom doesn't even have a door, haha, there's only a dirty plastic cheap waterproof curtain, haha, haha
5. The sheets were sticky and had an indescribable disgusting smell.
6. The furniture and components in the entire room are aging, the wallpaper in the corners is about to fall off, and there is even dust falling off the walls.
7. The homepage says it was renovated in 2010. What was renovated? ? ? Is it just to make the lobby look humane? ! When I arrived at the room, I almost thought I had arrived at an old shabby residence from the 1990s!
8. The lighting in the swimming pool is dim, the floor is stained, and the cabinets are dirty.
9. There is not even a lobby. I had to stand and wait for an hour while dragging my luggage while waiting for the room. In the end, I spent 50 to buy a seat at the coffee break next to it.
10. There is no takeout robot, so I have to go downstairs to get it! Greater Shanghai can be regarded as the central urban area, and there is not even a smart robot. This can be said to be not even a small hotel with three diamonds and three stars...
11. The corridor outside the room smells musty and has dim lights. I had to charge the vacuum cleaner directly at a socket in the corridor outside the room. Haha, the corridor is narrow and low-ceilinged. Fortunately, I didn‚Äôt drag a big luggage, otherwise I would have been almost unable to walk through it. ,hehe‚Ä¶
12. There was a guy at the front desk who looked so cool, he was a five-star guy, so he gave us a welcome smile, right?
That's it, the more I write, the angrier I get, but what I wrote is true and is for reference only. I hope it can help everyone, and don't let a hotel ruin your good impression of a trip to Shanghai like me.

I‚Äôll post two pictures at the end. I was so disgusted that I forgot to take pictures, so there are only two pictures left, so it‚Äôs okay to look at them.

The front desk was warmly received by Manager Han and Xiao Zhao. When we learned that we were celebrating the 30th anniversary of our wedding, we specially arranged for an upgraded executive suite. We are very satisfied! grateful! The hotel's breakfast and afternoon tea are very rich, and the waiters are friendly and serve with a smile. Zhao Liyun, head of the guest room depar**ent, came here to congratulate and presented welcome fruit, which is very heartwarming! The hotel is located on Nostalgic Road of Jufuchang, the "most Shanghai", with zero distance from the century-old buildings, surrounded by online celebrity restaurants, which is very convenient.

Except for the grand hotel lobby, it is really far from a five-star hotel. If it takes time and money to change the overall structure and style of the hotel, at the very least, we should use our minds to make corresponding improvements in some subtle places, but unfortunately, we haven't. Look at the non-slip mat in the bathroom, look at the worn out threaded towels, and the dirty pillow that can't bear to look straight at. You can't associate it with a 5 star hotel at all, it doesn't even look clean and tidy as a fast hotel.

As a five-star hotel with a long history, it not only carries a rich cultural heritage, but also brings guests an unparalleled noble experience with its excellent services and facilities.

As soon as you step into the hotel lobby, the first thing you see is the elegant and luxurious decoration and elegant layout. Carefully selected artworks, retro furniture and dazzling crystal chandeliers all reflect the hotel's noble temperament. And the wall of celebrity signatures full of history makes people feel like they have traveled through time and space and are in the bustling Shanghai Beach.

In addition to the beautiful view from the lobby, the hotel's guest rooms are equally stunning. Spacious and comfortable rooms, exquisite bedding, and various high-tech facilities provide guests with the ultimate living experience. The beautiful view of Huaihai Road Commercial Street outside the window adds a bit of charm to the room.


Of course, the charm of a five-star hotel lies not only in the hardware facilities, but also in the meticulous service. Here, every employee is customer-centered and provides considerate services to guests with professionalism and enthusiasm. Whether it is catering, fitness or business needs, the hotel can meet them one by one, making guests feel the warmth of home.

Check into the hotel room at least 3 o'clock. The lack of sleep and fatigue and the need to use the toilet caused me physical and mental health damage. I didn't even bother to apologize even if it was a commercial smirk üò¨. The young boy yawned in front of me in the middle of the night, why was he unprofessional and considerate?

The front desk of the day shift still has a normal sense of service. It is agreed to check out at 2:00 pm. Five-star hotels should not be manually cleaned by waiters who knock on the door before 12:00. Instead, it should be the front desk calling the room to ask if it is possible to continue the stay!

msg:Not worthy of a five-star hotel! The management is very poor. There are naked swimsuits and underwear hanging in the sauna room for drying during the day in a five-star hotel! It‚Äôs disgusting! Regardless of whether they are old members or old internal employees, it is really low-level to do such unqualified things and be allowed to do so. The swimming pool is also unavailable on weekends and only children take swimming lessons. The windows leak and the sound insulation is poor. Apart from the enthusiasm of most of the staff, this hotel is of a very low standard. Not suitable for customers who want to stay in four-star and five-star hotels.

The facilities are extremely old and simple, the lobby environment is very a**ospheric, but the various walls in the room are cracked and moldy, the door closes loudly and the sound insulation of the room is poor, and you will be woken up by the sound of the door closing at night if you wear earplugs. Regarding the location, the hotel is near the bar street, and there are endless traffic jams after six o'clock in the evening. I deliberately spent more money to book a room with a view, but the view outside the window is really hard to describe. The advantage is that many historical celebrities have lived in it, and it has some humanistic a**osphere.

msg:First sentence, this is the first time I write a bad review on the platform as a Ctrip platinum customer! 
On June 17, around 9:30, it was dark, rainy and slippery. We sent our distinguished customers to the Shanghai New Jinjiang Hotel, which is listed as a five-star hotel. We navigated to the parking lot, and the security guard told us coldly that parking was not allowed here, so we went into the duty room and sat down! We and the guests only walked into the lobby to check in with our luggage in the narrow pile of cars in the rain! We negotiated with the guests at the hotel and stayed for nearly 1.5 hours before leaving! The driver also waited for 1.5 hours at the scene but no one asked! We left the hotel smoothly that night! The next afternoon, the hotel security staff actually told our company that the driver damaged the parking railing? ! Say we hit and run? Laughing, we have been in the hotel for such a long time and the treatment of parking is indifferent, so we won‚Äôt argue with you, and no one asked us to deal with it at that time! Not to mention that it was the first time in a five-star hotel that there was no security guard to direct the reverse? Wouldn‚Äôt the hotel security guards argue when they saw the guests‚Äô vehicles leaving? Is this an AI hotel? They also delayed calling us for about 20 hours. The local traffic police would actually delay handling such things (not being there at the time)? Excuse me, what happened during such a long time? What is the security guard you hired for? Haven't you received verbal threats? After inspection, our company's vehicle did not have any scratches? ! How could this railing be broken? There are too many doubts. What is the hotel up to? It is puzzling! 
Second, the hotel's door closer is very bad. The guests said that they were often awakened by the loud sound of doors closing on the floor at night. They were drowsy in Shanghai for two days, which greatly reduced their work efficiency! Our company keeps apologizing to the guests! 
I wanted to say that Jinjiang is our brand hotel in Shanghai, but now I have been severely slapped in the face. The hotel equipment is aging, the security guard is like ****, and I was frightened by verbal coercion. I will never dare to go there again! Scary! ! 
I will copy this matter to the Shanghai Tourism Committee, Consumer Protection Committee, and Public Security Inspectorate. It is too embarrassing for the people of Shanghai!

In the morning, there is Fengyu Shengjian from Ruijin Road to Huaihai Middle Road. Ruby Cake Shop is an old dim sum shop in Shanghai. It is a good choice for breakfast. Turn left at the intersection of Huaihai Road and there is Guangming Village, where you can buy some fresh meat mooncakes, as well as Master Bao‚Äôs Meat Floss Cake, and Lao Dachang‚Äôs almond steak. If you are on a budget, turn right on Middle Huaihai Road and turn right at Dadong, Central Trade Center. It is worth a try. Roast duck and cherry foie gras are recommended.
The hotel has a gym, a swimming pool, a revolving restaurant on the top floor, a coffee shop, and a bar. It is suitable for short-term business trips and family travel. It is a hotel with a good comprehensive environment. The hotel is a ring building, with landscapes on all four sides, allowing the hotel to give high-rise rooms as much as possible.
The overall quality of the hotel service personnel is high. As an old foreign-related hotel in Shanghai, the chance of overturning is relatively small, and the service level is stable.

The water in the bathroom basin is extremely slow, the air in the room is obviously turbid, and ventilation is not known. There are more problems in the shower room. Water comes out of both ends of the hand shower (the handle is broken and cannot be screwed on). The mosaic on the floor is very dark and the gaps are serious. Look. It's quite uncomfortable to wear, some corners and gaps are moldy, and the desktop phone charging cable cannot be used to charge. The front desk service is unskilled. Needless to say, I feel like a new employee can understand. As a hotel owned by the well-known Jinjiang Group in China and located in the Shanghai headquarters, this standard is really disappointing. Apart from the location advantage, what else can it offer?

msg:This hotel is extremely poor. I booked a room for four days from October 14th to 18th. When I checked in, I was asked to pay a deposit of 2,000 yuan. The reason was that the deposit was 500 yuan per day. I have stayed in hotels in various places for two months, and I have never seen such a high deposit. I negotiated with the manager on duty, but the manager was arrogant and said it was their policy. This manager is not only extremely rude but also lacks professional training. If a five-star hotel like this has a dispute with a customer, a professional manager should ask the customer to sit down, make a cup of tea and communicate. But the manager stood behind the counter and argued loudly with me, laughing at my occasional words of English. I am over 60 years old, dragging two large suitcases, and no one offered to help me when I entered the hotel. Although the hotel has several restaurants, none of them are open to customers for lunch or dinner. They are all outsourced for weddings and the like. The room facilities are old and lack maintenance. I was about to take a shower and found something wrong with the faucet. I called them to fix it. I just wanted to use the safe after taking a shower, but found that the safe couldn't be closed, so I called the front desk again. This hotel service does not meet the mark of a five star hotel. This kind of state-owned hotel lacks professional management.

The hotel is too strong, and 10% of the remaining room rate will be deducted for early check-out, which is unreasonable.
Good things: it is clean, the service staff responds quickly, and the front desk service is good.

This time, I finally came to live here myself. The whole process of check-in was smooth and pleasant. I really felt the service standard and professional attitude of the old five-star hotel. From the doorman, to the lobby manager, to the aunt in the room depar**ent, they all pay special attention to the needs of the old man. Because I have experienced the professionalism of all the service links of the hotel, I really feel at ease living here. It is said that the hotel needs to live in a new hotel, but after the experience of staying in the new Jin Jiang Hotel, I think I will pay more attention to the soft power of the hotel. After all, the professional services and attitudes provided by the people working in the hotel are the only five in a family. The soul of a star hotel

What was the purpose of checking? When I returned to the hotel at 1.45 and wanted to check in, I was told that the room would not be released until 2 o'clock. This operation was very confusing. There was no place to sit in the lobby and I had to stand with my luggage and wait. Finally, the weird thing came. They asked for a 500 deposit and said that the room had a small bar. When we got to the room, there was a list of drinks from the bar. This room was worse than a hotel.

There are many shopping malls, a variety of specialty stores, and delicious food of different cuisines can be found all over the streets and alleys. Although the hotel is a bit old due to the baptism of years, it still has a magnificent momentum. The room facilities are equipped with smart toilets, which are clean and spotless, and the warm lighting gives people a sense of comfort. Manager Lin at the front desk of the hotel is full of enthusiasm, sincere service, and professional skills, which left us an excellent impression. It is a wise move to choose New Jinjiang Hotel when traveling in Shanghai.

msg:It may be the worst five-star hotel I have ever stayed in. It is understandable that the facilities are old, but the lack of maintenance makes the room facilities not as good as those of a fast hotel. There is a guest feedback sheet in the room, and there is no pen or ballpoint pen provided. Use a very light pencil to write your opinion. It seems that this opinion is just a formality. All the staff I met in the hotel during my stay did not take the initiative to say hello during the whole process. How arrogant are the Jinjiang people in Shanghai? The room was not cleaned when I checked in, and I was told that I couldn't get the room card, but I had to make a trip to get it myself. I didn't say that I would contact me when the cleaning was complete, let alone arrange for it to be delivered. If you have to wait, there is no free lobby seating area in the lobby. It's more like a shopping mall. The toiletries are probably of the quality of a fast hotel, and the shampoo and body wash are full of chemical smell. well. Originally, the hardware was not enough and the software was used to make up for it. It was a pity that this brand was ruined. The management team also went to Peace on the Bund and Waldorf Astoria to learn team building. Others said the facilities were many times older than yours. For service learning, any season, Orange Crystal is fine.

I wondered if the strong acid left by the grass cloth would irritate the skin. At about 7:30, I went downstairs and told the staff about the payment. A person who looked like a manager said: If it was a bug bite, we will take responsibility. It's really the first time I see such a person, it seems that I have never worked in the service industry. I went to work at around 8:00 and went to the nearby Xuhui District Central Hospital. The doctor said: There is no way to distinguish whether it is an allergy or an insect bite. I can only prescribe the medicine first and you eat and use it first. Later, I took the medicine prescribed by the doctor for about half a month before the itching disappeared, but there was a scar on my ankle (maybe it was dull color, or maybe it was too itchy and scratched at the time). I very much regretted that I booked this hotel that day, just because I lived in the urban area to be closer to my friends and to meet up.

Disadvantages: The shower can't hold up the bath water and sprays upwards. Fortunately, I brought a shower. The room is very noisy in the morning. I don't know where the noise is coming from. There are knocking noises here and there. The air conditioner is not warm enough. In the middle of the night It's cold, and the hot and cold rotating head of the faucet is difficult to operate.

I was about to check out, and there happened to be a guest at the check-out desk at the front desk who was being endlessly reminded, digested and dealt with. There were already two guests. While the male colleagues were working on it, a female employee next to me actually stood still the whole time, waiting for the two male colleagues next to me to do their work. She turned a deaf ear to my request to check out and hand over my room card. She just continued to look at the two male colleagues and said impatiently, "Wait a minute." . I waited for another minute and told her that I was just checking out and handing back my room card. She only needed to know my room number. What could be done in a few seconds? What was she waiting for? Incredible quality of staff. I can't believe the service quality of a long-established hotel in the city center. In addition, the bathroom is very small and old, the bedding is poor, the towels and bath towels are old, and the toiletries are poor. The room smells bad. The worst hotel I have stayed in in the past ten years is called a 5-star hotel, which is almost three-star!

The water pipes in the bathroom make noise at night, making it difficult to sleep at all, causing great disturbance and noise. Bad review! ! !

After I came back late in the afternoon, I found that the waiter only put a few new towels, the used cups on the table were still there, the post-meal stains on the table had not been cleaned at all, and even the quilt was still and messy on the bed. I have lived there for so many years. This is really the first time a hotel has encountered such a situation where the waiter decided to "no cleaning" on his own. I was disappointed with Jinjiang and had a bad stay experience. In addition, the room smelled very heavy of smoke and was not cleaned thoroughly. All of this makes me, who doesn‚Äôt like reviews, rarely write a negative review.

This is understandable and acceptable. But as a five-star hotel, old facilities do not mean they are bad. The temperature of the smart toilet seat is very high, which makes it not so comfortable in summer. The cleanable nozzle sprays cold water. This difference is unacceptable to me. I still try to adjust it. Same, there is also a refrigerator. Maybe the Minibar drinks are not placed for the convenience of check-out. I don't accept it but understand it, but it is incomprehensible that the refrigerator cannot cool down. There is an ice bucket in the room. Is it because the refrigerator is broken?
To say something good, the hygiene is well maintained, and the hotel's catering should be better. Many people come to the hotel to eat.

I feel that after the epidemic, the room is only worth 400, mainly because of its location. It's not as good as Crystal Orange or Atour. The wet and dry separation partition is a glass, which can only block one side. The other end of the sliding toilet doesn't even have a shock-absorbing rubber *****. It may hit the wall and break, which is a safety hazard. The wash basin does not have a domestic 220v socket. The hair dryer is placed in a drawer, but it is the kind that is hung on the wall and the hanging base is removed together. It is the oldest type with a seat. Fortunately, I brought my own hair dryer. The mirror faced the bed, and the curtain at the head of the bed seemed to be unfixed or fallen off. Anyway, one end of the curtain couldn't block the light. There are no sockets at the bedside and no lights or mains power supply. Anyway, those who don‚Äôt believe it know who lives there. I have stayed in so many five-star hotels but I have never stayed in such a rubbish one. If it weren't for the fact that I checked in at 3 a.m. on the first day and didn't want to go out early the next morning and come back at night, I really wouldn't have stayed the next day. I didn‚Äôt take pictures because I didn‚Äôt take my phone when I discovered those problems, and I was in a hurry and didn‚Äôt take any pictures. The room decoration is also relatively simple. In other hotels, laundry bags can be filled with dirty clothes and taken away. In his hotel, it was written not as a gift, and there was no refrigerator. There are also problems with front desk service. The front desk on the first floor didn't give me a bottle of water when I asked for it, so I was told to go to the room and call customer service to ask for it. Before checking in on the first day, I was told that I had been upgraded to a room. Didn't upgrade either. Really poor experience. There is not even a sofa in the lobby on the first floor for guests to rest and sit on.

It is extremely convenient for transportation, eating and drinking. The rooms are a bit old, but it can be seen that they have put in effort to improve them, and the service is also in place. , A very cost-effective hotel.

What's even more outrageous is that at 11 o'clock in the evening, a drunk guest came to open my door three times. Once, he brought a waiter to open it. Fortunately, I locked it. I'm just wondering, do you just open the door to someone without verifying the guest's identity? ? I called to complain that night, but there was no feedback. What was even more annoying was the fact that it was 8am the next morning! The front desk called (I was woken up) and said someone whose name was not mine at all, "Hello, Ms. xx, you reported yesterday that the door lock was broken and you couldn't open the door. We will change your room for you." I xxx was speechless! There was no sincere apology. It was the first time I stayed in such a bad hotel in Shanghai! ! Express hotels are better than Xin Jinjiang!

I called the lobby manager at the luggage storage area and said that the air conditioner was not turned on in the whole building. I asked two questions. Why is the front desk more than ten meters high? At that time, there were at least dozens of people. Still cool? Second, with so many foreigners, can they all tolerate such a high temperature in the room? The manager said to ask the engineering depar**ent for help, and then repeated it again. Finally, our room has air conditioning, so, I don‚Äôt know why, the front desk and the lobby manager will say that the whole building is not air-conditioned?

First of all, when checking in, the "Villa Executive View Twin Room" was reserved, but the little girl at the front desk gave a superior twin room. . . . .
Secondly, the executive room on the booking interface is marked with the trea**ent of the executive lounge. When inquiring at the hotel, the staff indifferently said that due to the epidemic, the executive lounge was cancelled without any compensation!
Again, the hotel's breakfast service staff was indifferent, turning a blind eye to the empty plate after the meal, and did not take it away after several walks. There are even waiters on duty playing with their mobile phones

All in all very disappointed! ! !

It's not easy to carry two babies, but fortunately there are adults to help. The lobby of this hotel is very classy, the check-in is a little slow, and the waiting time is a little long.
The room is relatively small, but it is enough to live in. The facilities are also relatively old, but it is very clean and tidy. I was very happy to stay for one night, and the children also have a place to discharge, which is very fulfilling. Originally wanted to stay for one night, but the price went up a lot and gave up. There is a chance to come again in the future! Food is still available!

The most frustrating thing is that after finally parking the car in a crowded parking lot, my wife tripped on a small step before entering the hotel's revolving door. , staggered and fell into the revolving door. The doorman about two meters next to me just let out a groan and made no response. I rushed forward and held on to the revolving door with all my strength. The door did not stop and kept turning. No one helped to press the emergency button. I pressed the stop button and no waiter came forward, so I could only try my best to get my wife who was lying in the revolving door to stand up. Finally, she climbed out of the revolving door with difficulty. I held her by the door, but she fell on her chest and knees. For several minutes, no service staff greeted us. Where we stood, the doorman was no more than four meters away from us, and the luggage counter was no more than ten meters away from us. All the service staff turned a blind eye. Later, I helped my wife to the left side of the lobby for tea. I sat down to catch my breath. An older waiter brought me a cup of hot water and asked my wife to sit down for a while. I gave him one point for the quality of service. The service of this kind of hotel cannot even match that of starless hotels. It is speechless and an embarrassment to Shanghainese. It is strongly recommended that Ctrip cancel its cooperation with this type of hotel, otherwise it will affect Ctrip's reputation.

The carpet in the room is very clean. It is the stubbornness of the old five-star. Because it is clean, it does not feel "dirty" in midsummer. The hotel is very close to the Xiangming test center, less than 100 meters, which can be said to be zero distance. The curtains of the room were opened to face Xiangming's door. The door was closed, and the students were busy writing their books inside. You could see the old parents who were leaving for the exams reluctant to leave, and the anxious old mothers watching from time to time. The breakfast and dinner provided by the hotel are good, because there is no buffet because of the epidemic. Most of the local staff hired by the front desk, cleaning, and waiters are well-trained and good-looking, and everything is very good.

Only the isolation bar did not have a queue sign to tell people how to obey your own cognitive order. There were even people who cut the queue to ask for a parking card. Toiletries are not available in the room and do not remind you. After the bathroom is closed in the middle of the night, it is automatically locked. You have to find maintenance personnel to repair it. The old facilities affect the experience. New Jin Jiang Hotel has been a brand of Shanghai hotels in my impression since I was a child. Now it is like this. No matter the facilities and services, it can't compare with chain hotels.

Mr. He stayed for 5 days and felt that the hotel service was medium-sized and medium-range, with Shanghai waiters as the mainstay, and there was a sense of intimacy. I like the spicy sauce noodles and small wontons in the hotel breakfast, and the breakfast variety is also rich. The lunch for two at the Blue Sky Revolving Restaurant on the 41st floor at noon on the 7th was very delicious, with all the colors and flavors. My husband and I were very satisfied. But on the evening of the 8th, my mother and husband had dinner for 3 people on the 41st floor, which was not satisfactory. One of the 3 aged and cooked drunk crabs, the meat in the crab shell was empty, after we reacted with the waiter, he gave us another one. The quality of the crab is not good and the taste is also poor. . . . . It's no exaggeration to say that it can even dump it on 18 roads. After that, the pepper fragrant snowflake beef was completely burnt, and after reacting to the waiter, a new plate was made, and it tasted. . . . . Occasional mistakes are forgivable, but hopefully just by chance, after all this is a 5 star hotel. On the evening of the 7th, we had dinner at Jingcui Ting. At that time, some dishes were sold out. The supervisor actively communicated with the kitchen and helped us replace other dishes. The dishes were well cooked and I liked them. Although the executive lounge is closed, you can have some small cakes at the lobby bar. Ordered Belgian ice cream and loved it.

The reception at the front desk is very good and the attitude is warm. Although the room has been refurbished, it is inconvenient. Many places are unreasonably designed. I just felt that the air conditioner was a little hot, and it didn't move after I adjusted the temperature. I thought it would be okay to come back after dinner, but it was still hot, so I called the master to fix it. After a minute, I checked the temperature and said there was no problem. I am very suspicious of you. He didn't move. Are you sure? He was very sure that he was woken up at 3:00 in the middle of the night. He could only pack up and change rooms in the middle of the night. He almost didn't sleep. I just stood there and complained, and I listened to it with no expression on my face, without any apology, and said coldly, what do you think, I will upgrade your room next time, as if looking at someone who came to extort... Director, said it was the Director who was off on Sunday and didn't answer the phone... Well, this is the first time I have been so badly insulted, goodbye forever, in such a state of affairs, such management, and finally closed the door. Thank you

msg:Only the wish of staying in a veteran five-star hotel in Shanghai, this will finally come true. I chose the New Jinjiang Hotel. The location of the hotel is impeccable, in the middle of Xinle Road and Huaihai Middle Road, opposite to the subway station of Line 13. On the way to Huaihai Middle Road, I found several Internet celebrity restaurants, which attracted many people to come to check in, not to mention Guangming Village on Huaihai Road. There are long queues for takeout and dine-in. The popularity is not acceptable. After eating, strolling along Huaihai Road all the way to the Cathay Cinema to watch a movie, I was delighted. The New Jinjiang Hotel has its own ground and underground parking lots, a clean swimming pool, and a revolving restaurant on the roof to enjoy. The hotel gave me a nice room with windows facing east and a wide view. The high-rise buildings in Lujiazui, Pudong have a panoramic view. The room feels very bright as soon as I step into the room. The room is not depressing. Although the furniture and rain shower equipment in the room are a bit old, It didn't make people feel uncomfortable. This time I didn‚Äôt book the hotel‚Äôs breakfast. I‚Äôm a bit regretful. The next day I walked to the Panlou upstairs in Parkson to have morning tea. I have nothing dissatisfied with staying at the New Jinjiang Hotel this time.

       I need to complain. The check-in time is a bit long. I have to wait in line every time I come. Maybe there are more procedures during the epidemic, and there are also various commi**ents.
       The room is relatively small, but there are still two small sofas and a coffee table, and it is enough for office work, but I personally prefer a separate shower room, of course I will choose to stay here next time

msg:1: I have been staying at the New Jinjiang Hotel for almost 20 days. I parked my car at 9:50pm on November 2nd. As soon as I entered the hotel‚Äôs door, I felt that a man in a red down jacket used his mobile phone to take pictures of me, follow me, and the first few days. I didn‚Äôt care about it this time. I feel like I‚Äôm too worried, but tonight I was really scared. For several days in a row, I didn‚Äôt dare to go upstairs in the hotel lobby. I was sitting in the lounge area near the elevator in the hotel lobby. The one wearing red clothes The man in the down jacket hid behind the pillar and kept looking at me. I was terrified. He called the 110 police call. The man in the red clothes heard me call the 110 police call and ran out of the hotel lobby quickly, but the hotel security was indifferent and I asked But the hotel staff said that it can‚Äôt be called unless the police. If there is nothing to do, who would ask the hotel staff for help calling the monitoring for no reason. Monitoring is not installed for the safety of the hotel and the safety of the guests. Yes, if it is not for safety, what is the point of installing monitoring?
2: At the same time as the incident happened, I said to the front desk, please invite your person in charge. I want to know how to solve this matter, whether to help call for monitoring or how to deal with it. The so-called person in charge looks indifferent. It‚Äôs really speechless. I told the so-called hotel manager that when you showed up in your hotel, stalking people and jeopardizing personal safety, I asked to check out. The so-called person in charge said that it was ten o‚Äôclock in the evening and the room was withdrawn. No, I‚Äôm struggling with me about the room‚Äôs inability to return, instead of helping me solve my personal safety problem in the hotel. It‚Äôs too sad. I stayed in your hotel for more than 20 days and encountered Things really show the attitude of a hotel to take care of and deal with problems. If one person takes a room card, everyone else can wait in the elevator building, and they can all go upstairs together. Where is the so-called safety? Give me a satisfactory answer, and I will hold the blame to the end. I hope that the truly responsible leaders of the hotel can stand up and deal with this matter, instead of the so-called leadership, with an indifferent attitude. Could the hotel recruit such employees? Is the hotel pension?
3: Actually, I really don‚Äôt want to say anything about it. I stayed in the hotel one day after another. The room staff didn‚Äôt knock on the door in the morning and opened the door of the room. I was still in bed and I was not wearing any clothes. I was scared. I had to yell, the guest room staff left. When I complained to the front desk, several people at the front desk were still laughing. Is it so funny? Is it so funny just because I'm a male responding to this situation? At that time, I was going to get angry, and no one laughed anymore. Where is the big leader of the hotel? I hope your hotel will be in charge and solve the problem for me. Or see you in the media.

Thirty years later, although the equipment is not comparable to the new hotels, the foundation is still there, and the area is well maintained, and the size is acceptable. The biggest drawback is the room. The floor height is too low.
The most important thing is that the revolving restaurant on the top floor was where Deng Gong made the decision to open and open Pudong. This historical thickness is incomparable to the new hotel.

msg:1. After driving down the parking lot, I realized that I couldn‚Äôt get in and there was no sign to remind me. The parking space is a lift type, which is very unfriendly and can easily injure people if you get out of the car.
2. There are no toiletries in the room without reminding them first. No comb, no toothbrush, etc. It took a long time after I called to deliver it.
3. The shower in the bathroom is also quite old. The shower is above the bathtub. It feels like going back to 10 years ago.
In short, the equipment is old enough, but the service is mediocre.

The location of the hotel need not be said, the core of the city center.

msg:This is the worst feeling I have ever had in a five-star hotel. I had a very bad feeling from the moment I met the two men at the front desk when I checked in. Sure enough, the deluxe double room we stayed in was said to be 30-35 square meters in size, but when we entered it, we felt that it was a small and slender room. The room was only 3.5 meters wide (definitely not 4 meters wide!), and it might have been 6.5 meters long. About meters. This hotel is really bragging about how spacious the room is, but the reality is that once a large bed is placed, there is only a narrow "gap" on both sides of the bed.
         The wooden structure in the room gives it an old feel. The shower is definitely a configuration you won‚Äôt see in a five-star hotel. It is probably the kind of ‚Äústick-type‚Äù shower head that is only used in two- and three-star hotels. The toilet seems to be temperature-adjustable, but the overall shape definitely feels like a low-end product among low-end products. I really admire that this five-star hotel can "carefully" select such an inferior temperature-adjustable toilet and the flush handle of the toilet. It's actually a thin stick, which alone can make people laugh out loud.
         This is the situation of the so-called "New Jinjiang Hotel" in a prime location on the Shanghai Bund. I am very familiar with the "Jinjiang" hotels in Chengdu and Shanghai (excluding the unpopular "Jinjiang Star"), but this is really my first time staying at this so-called "New Jinjiang Hotel", just because of the name. It always makes me feel a bit like a fake, so let's get the old signature "Jinjiang".

After eating, I was asked to wait for half an hour for a room card. I told the front desk that I had already processed it and just handed me the room card. She also checked my information and showed my room. After looking at it, he put it down and asked me to continue waiting. If you pick up everything and hand it to me, wouldn't that be the end of it? He put down the room key again and insisted that I continue to queue for half an hour. His tone of voice was extremely bad. I was really convinced. The door to the room was stuck on the carpet and it was difficult to open it. The sofa was extremely dirty and the bathroom shower head couldn't be fixed with screws. Don't you want to tighten it?

Breakfast is open at 6:30 in the morning. I arrived at 6:35 and only one-third of the things were set out. . .
Most of the staff in the breakfast area were chatting or getting themselves drinks. . .
There are no tools such as clips next to the food. .
The porridge didn't come out until 6:53.
The Japanese and Korean items were not out at all after seven o'clock. . .
The coffee from the coffee machine is cold. . .
I had to catch a flight at seven o'clock, so I could only eat two fried eggs and ran away in panic. . .
After checking out that night, the staff contacted me and explained. He also said that he would treat me to afternoon tea next time to make up for it. . . HahahahaüòÇ, I think there may not be a next time!

msg:The location of the hotel is still very good, and the service at the hotel front desk is also very good. After checking in, I found that there was luggage at the front desk and even called the room to ask if it was our luggage. It is commendable! But the customer service of the hotel cannot be complimented. The first thing I want to complain about is that the room has a separate power card. Unlike other hotels where the room card and power card are integrated, it is convenient for guests to leave the hotel without removing the power card. , which was originally a very good move, but when the customer service staff was cleaning the room, they took away the guest's electricity card without permission. When they later called the front desk to ask for it back, the service staff did not apologize at all! ! ! Another complaint is that because the guest returned to the room late at night, he ordered takeout, so he asked the front desk if he could send a pair of chopsticks. However, when the service staff delivered it, the guest who was traveling with him did not know the quantity, so he asked him if it was OK. His attitude was very bad when he offered another pair as a gift. He asked the customer if he didn't know how many pairs he wanted. Let me ask you, you are in the service industry, and what you pay attention to is service. Moreover, the customer's tone is inquiring, and they don't ask why you don't give me an extra pair. I wonder where your stubbornness comes from? ? ? After that, I complained to the hotel's complaint depar**ent. Instead of asking the service staff about the situation, they asked the guest what happened. Is this what the complaint depar**ent of a five-star hotel should do? ? ? After that, I did not receive an apology from the service staff, but only sent a fruit plate (which contained a clear apple, a small nectarine, and a red apple) while the guests were resting. This is a five-star hotel. When will you apologize to your guests? In short, the experience of this five-star hotel is extremely poor! ! ! !

msg:The service at the front desk of the hotel was rubbish. When I arrived around 1 o'clock in the evening, there was only one person serving. Guests had to wait in line for a long time. It turned out that there were other staff walking around in their room. I couldn't make an appoin**ent for airport pick-up. The service manual didn't specify what time I could make an appoin**ent. I called and told me that I got off work at five o'clock, so I couldn't make an appoin**ent. I didn't know what time I would be able to get to work in the morning, so I couldn't make an appoin**ent. Haha, the service attitude was also very poor. This is a five-star hotel. In addition, there are only a few chairs in the lobby for people to sit on, which are not even as many as some express hotels. Really won't come again

msg:The check-in queue in the lobby was very long, and I couldn't even bother to answer any questions I asked. There is no air conditioning in the room, and the formaldehyde smell is very obvious, just like a fast hotel. The bathroom floor drain is broken and has not been repaired. The lobby is five-star in size, the service is 3-star, and the rooms are quickly decorated.

msg:I won't stay at this hotel a second time.
Because it was a hotel designated by the project party, it had four rooms, and I temporarily booked an extra room for the driver, so I booked it on Ctrip. Not to mention the price, the average price in Shanghai.
We checked in at almost 12 o'clock in the evening, but we were not allowed to enter the hotel as soon as it arrived, and there were no cars inside. We asked the waiter to park the car when we got in, but that didn't work. The security guard said confidently that they were not allowed to enter the hotel. If there was such a rule, would guests still be willing to come on a rainy day? When I left on the third day, I discovered that there were a few foreign guests (a bit like Indians who saw the consulate arriving in cars), so there was a security check in the lobby, which was somewhat understandable.
The weird thing is what happened when we checked in. Another young man and I waited for the driver to arrive for about twenty minutes. To be honest, we were really tired at this late hour. We chatted without a word, and the young man didn‚Äôt even look around (front desk). I sat down at the lobby manager‚Äôs duty desk two meters away. We continued chatting, and he subconsciously pulled the drawer. At this time, a fat and dark staff member came over and asked the young man, What are you doing? At first we thought we weren't allowed to sit down, so we said we were a little tired and wanted to do some exercise. He then pressed us and asked, "What are you doing with your hands?" The young man was quite polite, but when he said that I just subconsciously made such an action, he became even more aggressive: Are you so polite? Is it okay for you to go into other people‚Äôs homes and randomly look through their drawers? Only then did I realize that the young man was also confused and couldn't say anything. I just shouted back and asked him what his attitude was. He was even more *, saying that he had this attitude, what‚Äôs wrong with you going through other people‚Äôs drawers! I said that we are guests and there is no place to sit here. I made a subconscious action. If you see it, please remind me. As for scolding people in this way, it is rude and denial of personality? Is this a suitable work attitude for a service worker like you? He said there was nothing inappropriate and as long as his position was right, it didn't matter how he expressed it. I won‚Äôt say much more about the follow-up. I said that I would provide feedback on the relevant situation to customer satisfaction, and he said it didn‚Äôt matter.
It's really great, so I rarely give reviews to this hotel.
This staff member claimed to be the duty manager and his surname was Xiong. He lacked the most basic communication skills and crisis management skills, which was the only factor that led to this negative review.

msg:Das Hotel ist schon etwas in die Jahre gekommen. F√ºr 5 Sterne h√§tten wir an manchen Ecken etwas mehr erwartet. Grunds√§tzlich ist das Hotel aber in Ordnung. Die Lage ist ebenfalls ok. Nicht komplett zentral, aber auch nur eine Metrostation von der Westnanjing Road entfernt. Das Fr√ºhst√ºck fanden wir allerdings nicht √ºberzeugend. Weder den internationalen Teil, noch den chinesischen.
