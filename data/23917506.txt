In fact all staff members were so friendly and helpful. Well trained and so focused on customer care and satisfaction, Willy and his restaurant staff were at our every beck and call and more.it would be unfair to mention just a few names because everyone was so attentive to the guests The rooms are beautiful and comfortable,  the waterpark and kids club are wonderful and a great way to entertain guests. We will definitely return to the Crowne Plaza Huailai here and highly recommend it to everyone. Our boy enjoyed playing with the rabbits too.

The hotel has complete facilities, gorgeous and elegant, especially the water world, children's playground, and swimming pool, which are very attractive to children. The water temperature is also moderate.
The buffet breakfast is very good and the variety is rich to meet all kinds of different tastes.
Special thanks to Yang Lu, the waiter at the hotel front desk, for upgrading the balcony room facing the garden for us. At night, we can sit on the balcony to watch the stars and blow the natural breeze. It's so comfortable. Crowne Plaza Huailai is a good place to immerse yourself in the experience of walking with your kids.

The hotel is located in Hebei but very close to Beijing, less than 2 hours' drive away, and the hotel is very large. Like a castle, the greening is very good. The hotel front desk service is enthusiastic and patiently introduces the service facilities. Although there are many guests, it is also in order. The theme room we booked is very well decorated by the children, and the hygiene is also good. There is also an outdoor balcony. Standing on the balcony, you can see the hotel's garden and the green shade by the lake is very pleasant. There are a lot of children's entertainment facilities, indoor children's playground, outdoor children's playground and the most attractive water park. The baby is so happy that he doesn't want to go home. The buffet dinner at the hotel has grilled skewers and beer, and various desserts are very beautiful. The hotel staff have good service awareness. They are very patient to show us the way when they are not familiar with the hotel for the first time. It's a very good experience, so close and so beautiful. I will come to Hebei on the weekend and experience it again during the summer vacation.

There are water parks, swimming pools, indoor children's playgrounds, outdoor children's playgrounds, go-karts, and a small zoo. During the May Day holiday, there are also rainbow runs and pumpkin fields. If you only stay for one night, you won't be able to play all of them. There is also a small crown market, which is also very good.
The manager Huangli at the front desk is very capable. Whether it is check-in or any problems during the stay, she can help to solve them very efficiently, making guests feel at home and very comfortable!

msg:Traveling on May Day, worried about the crowds and difficult roads, decided to walk around Beijing, and chose Huailai Crowne Plaza. Compared with the huge crowds on the Internet, this choice is correctüòÇ
The hotel room is large, the facilities are good, and the water park is definitely the favorite of the baby. The ladies at the front desk, Xun Yihan and Lei Cheng, are very gentle and considerate. They introduced the hotel facilities and the surrounding situation in detail, and upgraded the room. The room is very close to the restaurant and swimming pool. The child ran over in a flash, not to mention how happy. There are indeed many people on May Day, and the dining experience is not particularly good, but to be honest, the taste and ingredients are still good. Let's be more tolerant of each other on holidays. I believe that the experience will be better if you come on weekdays.
The location and transportation are really good. It is very convenient to go to Guanting Reservoir Jimingyi. There are many places in Huailai that are worth walking around slowly. I guess I will come again in the future. The child is talking about staying here again

The Crowne Plaza in Chongli left a good impression, so I wanted to find time to come here. I tried my best to buy a round-trip ticket, and finally changed to an earlier train back to Beijing.
The deluxe king-size bed with balcony I chose was the most expensive room type except for the suite. In the end, the second-floor west-facing window was a tree, and there was the sound of the exhaust fan of the water park. The fabric chairs in the restaurant were all covered with traces of food. There are many charges, and the dishes in the Chinese restaurant are not cheap. The most cost-effective one is the stir-fried noodles. The waiter was slow to respond.
The others did not leave a deep impression, and there is no reason to recommend it to others. It's a pity that such a good location is gone.
Oh, yes, the only thing that looks good is the sunset.

The sanitation is very good and the facilities are very new. The hotel has a children's playground and a water park. The breakfast is rich in variety, and the seats are tight after 8:30.

Disadvantages:

1. The layout of the hotel is unreasonable, the signs are not clear, and you need to ask for directions. There are no signs at the escalator, corners and other intersections, which requires further asking for directions. Moreover, many doors of the hotel are locked, and you can only enter and exit from two limited doors, which is very inconvenient!

2. It takes a long way from the parking lot to the hotel gate. The doorman saw me borrowing the luggage cart to move the luggage, and he didn't come forward to help. We took the children to push the luggage cart in the strong wind, which was quite strenuous. I feel that the doorman lacks professionalism and is not a way to treat guests.

Yang Lu, the front desk clerk, is very professional, smiling, and listens to my opinions sincerely, which makes me feel some service warmth when I check out. When summer comes, I will bring my children to play in the water again.

Check-in is really slow, and the two rooms booked were not locked together in advance.
Suitable for traveling with children, indoor and outdoor children's playgrounds, cute pet parks, and naughty castles are all very attractive to children.
There are some problems with dining. During the Qingming Festival holiday, you need to queue up for dinner in the Western restaurant. The Chinese restaurant takes a long time to order and serve. The taste is not bad. I like the old-fashioned pot-baked pork. We only have one waiter on the second floor. She has to serve the dishes and is too busy to copy the tables.
The breakfast buffet pancakes and noodles are good

The air conditioner needs to be turned on to a higher temperature, or the balcony windows are leaking. I suggest you go to the front desk or a certain hotel. I will make a reservation that day. The price is 780 yuan including breakfast, the price of some audio is 480, and the front desk is 489. It is cheaper than the hotel in Beijing and it is fun. However, Ctrip‚Äôs price is more expensive than other platforms. It is recommended that you compare and book. The day we went there seemed to be a direct sales brand. At the annual meeting, I booked a double bed. The front desk told me that the double bed was gone. When I went back, I saw that the double bed I had booked was a twin bed. I was too lazy to change it. I stayed for 2 nights and the next day I booked a double bed from somewhere else. The amusement park costs 590, Ctrip does not include the fact that we didn‚Äôt take the children to play on the first day, but one day is actually enough!

msg:A very good family travel experience. Vivian, who is in charge of the hotel front desk, took the initiative to contact us before the trip to understand our needs. After learning that we needed an extra bed when traveling with a baby, he also helped us upgrade to a larger room type, which made the family stay more comfortable. When we arrived, In the future, we will actively help with early check-in and relieve travel fatigue. Be sure to like it. During the extra bed process, the staff also enthusiastically gave me an Undersea Column doll. The hotel itself is quite fun, the water park is very good, and the outdoor play area can also be used to spend some time. We had two buffets in the morning and evening, which were very sumptuous. Very recommended.

During the National Day holiday, a popular travel time, when the room was tight, he upgraded us to a deluxe double room with a bathtub and a dressing room. The room is also larger than ordinary rooms, which is suitable for our family with children. It brings a lot of convenience.
       The hotel facilities are very good and convenient. There are many facilities for children to play. The children had a lot of fun.
       There are many outdoor plants in the hotel, suitable for walking, and the outdoor facilities are complete.
       The hotel breakfast is also delicious.

Manager Huang at the hotel front desk called one day in advance to confirm the itinerary and introduced us to the hotel's entertainment facilities and business hours. He was very considerate. It is a 2-hour drive from downtown Beijing. It is very convenient. The hotel is very large. Hawthorn trees can be seen everywhere. The red ones are very attractive. Huailai has a pleasant climate and is cooler than Beijing in the morning and evening. It is recommended to bring a jacket. The front desk thoughtfully arranged 3 adjacent rooms for us. The front desk employee Lei Cheng quickly checked in for us and introduced the location and time of the restaurant in detail, as well as the facilities and services for children to play. The concierge helped us transport our luggage. , we booked a deluxe double room. The room is large and has a bathtub. The room is also very clean. You can see the hotel's small garden outside the window, with beautiful scenery and some small animals. Children can play in the indoor and outdoor children's parks, and the water park is not expensive. A family can visit for 228 for 2 days, which is a great value. There are two restaurants in the dining facilities where you can choose from Chinese or Western buffet. You don‚Äôt have to leave the hotel for 2 days and 1 night, and the itinerary can be fully arranged, which is very suitable for a baby-walking vacation.

msg:Very pleasant trip, especially thanks to Ms. Lei Cheng for her warm service, who upgraded us to a deluxe room. To be honest, the deluxe room is significantly better than the deluxe room in terms of room and location, and I will take the initiative to choose a deluxe room next time.

We stayed in three rooms for 2 days, let's talk about our feelings from several aspects.
[Room] As mentioned earlier, the deluxe room has been upgraded. The elevator in the deluxe room is very close to the restaurant and the water world. It can be said that you can return to the room to take a shower in a minute after getting out of the swimming pool wrapped in a bathrobe, which is very convenient for children. The deluxe rooms and suites are on the first floor, and the number of rooms is small. Although it is full on weekends, the side of the deluxe rooms is very quiet. The deluxe room is large in size and very comfortable to live in. The sound insulation of Crown has always been good. My family members are very light sleepers and can be woken up by a little movement, but this time I heard no noise at all in the morning and at night. Praise!
[Water World Swimming Pool] There are a lot of things to do in the water world. Although there are many people on weekend afternoons, to be honest, I don't find it annoying. Except for the big slide, which has to be queued for a minute or two, everything else is casual. There are three swimming pools, one is formal and the other two are suitable for smaller children. You can enter and exit repeatedly during your stay wearing the wristband.
[Service] The service is very good. We were received by Ms. Lei Cheng in the lobby. She always kept a smile and answered all kinds of questions patiently. She was gentle and efficient, which made our group very comfortable. In addition, many details have verified that the hotel's overall service is good, and it doesn't care about the guests. For example, entering the water world many times a day, changing the bath towels and bathrobes in the room many times, the waiters are very enthusiastic every time, and the second day of stay, because the child is playing crazy Consuming a lot of mineral water, the waiter kindly gave us a box, which made us very grateful. Unlike some hotels, it is very stingy to ask for mineral water.
[Entertainment] In addition to the water world and swimming pool, the outdoor activity venue is also very good, suitable for children under the age of 12. There is a lake in the park, suitable for walking after dinner.
[Dining] The breakfast buffet is not bad, and can meet the requirements of this level of hotel. The price of the Chinese restaurant is medium, and the taste is not too amazing. You can eat normally. The dinner buffet is only available on Saturdays. I went to the nearby Guishui River to eat outside that day. I missed it, but the skewers smelled good after I came back.
Overall, it is highly recommended. I heard that the water world is also very warm in winter. I plan to go again in winter!

The service was warm and made people feel at home. The children's playground and water park were very good, and the water slide was very fun. Children need it It takes 1.5 meters to play the big slide. The Chinese restaurant Caifeng Xiaoguan tastes very good. The recommended dishes are the crown lamb chops (slightly fatter), and the reservoir fish cakes.

msg:Facilities: Room 1508, above the door and near the sink, 1 minute, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 30 minutes, undetermined minutes, "deng'deng", "dengÔΩûdeng", "deng'dengdeng", "deng ~dengdeng"... At first I thought it was someone knocking on the door, but after my observations at 12 o'clock, 1 o'clock, 2 o'clock, and 3 o'clock in the morning, I was sure it was coming from the door and the top of the sink. My wife and children slept soundly I didn't wake up, so I didn't call room service, but I strongly recommend that the hotel arrange maintenance personnel to sit there and listen for a while. This sound lasted until around 10 am. I haven't heard it again. After all, it is the top 5th floor. I Guess it's the abnormal noise of the pipeline. It's quite annoying for people who sleep late. In the dead of night, this "deng'dengdeng" sound is quite obvious.

Hygiene: It‚Äôs ok, I strongly recommend changing the toilet paper to a higher quality one, as this toilet paper is too cheap.

Environment: Geographical location, you can understand in a second when you open the takeaway software. There is almost nothing there. The price of the unmanned supermarket in the hotel is almost the same as that of the scenic spot. The hotel restaurant, the Chinese restaurant reviews and ratings dare not try it, the two types of pasta in the western restaurant, the creamy mushroom and bolognese pasta are not bad, the Margherita pizza is not worthy of the name... But the advantage is that this pizza is really cheap, Even after ordering these three, the food was served very slowly. Almost all the people who come to live here have a baby, and the number of people who have breakfast on Monday during the summer vacation will not be very comfortable.
If there are not many people in the water park, there are still people to play, but it is not big, and the swimming pool is not deep. Children can play in the water, swim, and play.
The hotel also needs to improve the ventilation or air-conditioning fresh air system. The children's playground is filled with the smell of moisture from the water park next to it. The corridor in the guest room area on the 1st floor smells like disinfectant. The smell of air freshener in the toilet next to it, the corridor on the 5th floor is okay, but there is a "deng'dengdeng" sound in the room...
In view of the geographical location... probably, if the surrounding environment does not improve significantly, it is unlikely to come here, and there is a checkpoint to go back and forth, and there will obviously be traffic congestion on weekends.

Service: The service is not bad, all the service staff I met were fine, very good, and I even gave a souvenir when I checked out.
It's a pity that the hardware and geographical location are not ideal. The price plus water park tickets are generally average.

You can play with water, feed small animals, and coax children to relax. Hygiene needs to be done more carefully.

The overall service of the hotel is good, and the breakfast buffet is okay. There is a water park, a children's playground, an outdoor playground, a bouncy castle, and all the necessary facilities. However, I personally feel that the design is a bit careless. It will be boring for children to play for a while, and the weather is particularly good in the afternoon. Children love to play in the outdoor playground. The highlight of the hotel is a large lawn. The fountain near the front of the hotel is also very beautiful. There are special pictures at the back and there are small animals to feed. When the weather is good, walking in the back is not as comfortable as other guests. I also watched a particularly beautiful sunset. . Overall can give 8 points.

The second is a serious safety hazard. If you follow the direction of the escape route, the door is locked with a key, and the indoor windows cannot be opened. Looking at so many hotels with children, if there is a problem, the consequences are unimaginable. The third is to take the baby to swim, saying that the child is young and must be accompanied by an adult, and buy a package ticket. Go to the buffet, the child is 1.43 meters, and he said that he is over the standard, so he has to pay the full price. Is your family poor and crazy? When I live in Sofitel, Wanda and other hotels, especially when I‚Äôm in a suite, the waiters and managers will meet the needs of the guests. If you pay me 98, maybe I can bring you higher consumption. The key is the look of contempt, which I still can't stand. The fourth is sanitation.

To catch up with the May Day holiday, in order to shorten the traffic distance and avoid the fatigue of the journey, we ranked the number of hotels around Beijing. Finally, after comparing the environment, facilities, entertainment and other angles, we chose Crowne Plaza Huailai. The hotel is located at the foot of the Great Wall. It takes only 1.5 hours to reach the city by car, which is faster than going to the outer suburbs of Beijing! It is more suitable for us to travel with our family, it is very good~~

The hotel is a beautiful European-style castle style, surrounded by mountains and rivers, with picturesque scenery. The service staff of the hotel are very enthusiastic and responsible. Although there are many people staying in the hotel during May Day, they still take the initiative to help with luggage after entering the store and take them to the front desk for check-in. People feel very comfortable. In particular, Vivian Huang, the lobby manager who received us, was considerate and considerate. Knowing that we brought children to play, he took the initiative to introduce us to the various entertainment items and facilities of the hotel, and told us the dining time and restaurant location one by one. IHG The incomparable thoughtfulness, warmth and professionalism of the people are on full display and made us feel right at home.

The hotel is very suitable for parents and children. The hotel itself has a children's playground, an indoor water world, a constant temperature swimming pool, an outdoor unpowered playground, and various parent-child activities. It is very comfortable to just stay in the hotel. My children fell in love with the water world as soon as they came. The indoor water park with more than 1,500 square meters is a paradise for children to play in the water. There are various large and small water slides, bubble parties and other super complete water toys. It is very suitable for bringing children to have fun. up. There are four pools in the hotel swimming pool. The children's paddling pool has a higher water temperature, which is very suitable for children who are afraid of cold. The larger pool is slightly cooler, and it is very suitable for swimming. There are also supporting changing rooms, shower rooms and sauna rooms, the experience is very good.

Thanks to Vivian for providing excellent service to our family, we had an unforgettable and pleasant parent-child trip, and we are looking forward to our next stay.

The cleaning staff are also very considerate, and the children in the water park also had fun. However, the overall system and management of the hotel is indeed lacking a lot. The room temperature at night shows 27 degrees, and the air conditioner can only produce heat. It is so hot that I can‚Äôt sleep and open the balcony door. As a result, the whole family suffers from wind pain in the morning. Secondly, it is the first time that hotel breakfast and water park can be sold separately. The foreign people are very mixed, and the experience of staying in the hotel is reduced. Third, no one took the initiative to inform the location and time of breakfast, and the drink coupons given by gold card members did not remind me that I almost threw them away as adverti*****ts. Fourth, the hotel is not big, but the May Day children's activities are in the lobby except for the paid ones. I really didn't find any other ones, and no one introduced or guided them. In addition, the price I booked earlier has slightly increased but it is still reasonable. Later, the price doubled to three times on May Day. I really think that the hotel should first focus on how to improve the user experience. After all, there is nothing around you to attract customers. If it's just for the water park, it won't last long.

The water in the swimming pool is also warm, very good, children can play happily
Have to come several times a year. the price is right
There is nothing to eat around. It is recommended to stew in an iron pot in the surrounding mountains for more than ten kilometers. It tastes good and the price is good. Just don‚Äôt be too picky about hygiene.
The price of Caifeng Xiaoguan is getting more and more expensive. A piece of Xianghe Meatloaf 68 tastes pretty good. The variety is getting less and less, and there is only one piece of paper left on the menu
Breakfast was ok at least with noodles and pancakes.

The price is about half cheaper than the Crowne Plaza Hotel Badaling next door, the hardware is not bad, there is a huge children's playground and water world. But be careful when booking a room. The water world and the swimming pool are two different things. Not all room types include the water world, and some need to purchase tickets separately. There is still a lack of service awareness. When we arrived at the hotel at night, we saw a car full of people and many suitcases and baby carriages. The two security guards at the door were standing there chatting, without any intention of coming to help or opening the door. , but one of them came over and told me that I couldn't park here and had to go to the parking lot. Although it is a service industry, it gives people the feeling that they first position themselves as managers.

The lobby is still a bit empty, it would be nice to set up a coffee shop or bar to provide afternoon tea. The water park is open to the outside world, so it is quite chaotic. There are old men rubbing their feet in the small pool where children play. In terms of management, young male administrators should be added to patrol the park. The equipment in the water park is very good, and there is no water park that children can resist. Room service was very good and dealt with issues in a timely manner. It is recommended to increase the ticket price of the water park and cancel the logic of hotel guests paying. While staying in the water for free, it can screen higher-quality guests and increase the hotel‚Äôs accommodation revenue.

The room is styled in off-white and black lines. The interior is simple and elegant. Textiles are pretty good. There are even bathrobes and slippers for the kids.

The whole area of the hotel is very quiet, suitable for relaxation, and I stayed with my children for two days. Children love the swimming pool, water park. There is also an outdoor amu*****t park, and there is actually a go-kart field. We liked walking through the woods on the side of the hotel.

The breakfast buffet was great, in which the butter had a special taste. Dinner is also eaten at the hotel, which is very delicate and affordable.


The waiter has a good temperament, is very confident in handling people, and has high efficiency. The sense of affinity is very real. Not contrived. This is to be commended.

Around the hotel, it is recommended to go to Ruiyun Winery, which is a Tuscan architectural complex-style winery. You can also go to Wild Duck Lake Wetland Park and see Guanting Reservoir. It is also very close to Badaling and Juyongguan Great Wall.

Will come back again, great place to relax.

We went to the hotel on weekdays and asked the hotel to arrange connecting rooms for us. It is said that the room type rarely needs to be arranged according to the situation.
Check in at three o'clock and enter the hotel to catch up with the welcome puppet. The children are in high spirits, but the puppet is a little bit of a tool and not enthusiastic.
There are many parent-child facilities, and the outdoor playground is too discharged. The indoor park is next to the water park, so it is very humid and stuffy, and the child is sweating. There are also paid crafts and bangers to play. [There was a waiter who needed training to speak. We didn‚Äôt know that there was a fee for archery, and no one looked at or posted the price list. When he saw us playing, he ran over and said, ‚ÄúYou can make up for it. These are all fees. You can‚Äôt play without paying.‚Äù ! You are very rude, who lacks your 20 yuan! „Äë
The water park is very noisy, and it has been spraying water on the lubricating ladder. Everyone said that this place is good, but my baby girl may be young and scared. Wherever she goes, she will get wet from the water on her head. After playing three times, she will switch to the free swimming pool. The water temperature of the swimming pool should be constant temperature, a little temperature, suitable for children.
There are fewer people on weekdays, and the lunch and dinner buffet is not open. There is a restaurant in the hotel where you can order a la carte. The taste of several meals here is not bad.
Except for the staff in the children's park, the rest are good.

The room is very small, not at all the 40 square meters marked by Ctrip. (The Badaling Crown is also 40 square meters, which is much larger than this) and the hotel TV is actually covered with snowflakes. Check in in the afternoon and go directly to the buffet. The New Year‚Äôs Eve hotel actually prepared a poor hot pot buffet. There are only some frozen beef and mutton slices, and several shellfish and vegetables. There are more than 150 rich, and the hot pot is served only half a day. Due to the large number of people, the restaurant is in chaos. The breakfast buffet is also poor, and no one accepts breakfast coupons for breakfast, so you can enter at will. During the Chinese New Year holiday, all the hotel rooms are fully booked. Doesn't the hotel marketing depar**ent communicate with the catering depar**ent to make adequate preparations?
Taking children to the water park is not suitable for children to play at all, and the water is very cold, and it takes less than ten minutes to go out.
Originally scheduled to stay for two nights, we decisively negotiated to check out. I would like to praise Ctrip for this, and I got a reply soon, yes.
The front desk was also chaotic when we checked out at noon the next day. We paid online, but we were told to go to the front desk to refund.
Maybe it's because the epidemic has just ended, and they opened in a hurry to make money without being prepared. In short, this kind of experience has not been experienced in the past ten years. I hope the hotel will reflect on it and see if it can deal with consumers in the long run! ! !
Has entered my hotel blacklist, will not go again! ! I also hope that Ctrip will re-rate this hotel. Not worthy of a luxury hotel! ! ! !

Environment: The hotel has a heated swimming pool, an indoor water park, and an indoor and outdoor children's playground. It seems that skating is also possible, and there are many things to do. But this time I didn't see a place for skating, and there was no introduction from the service staff when I checked in.

Service: When I checked in, it was not yet the New Year's Day holiday, so there were not many people. It felt like the hotel was not open, and the front desk staff were expressionless. It didn't look like the service of a five-star hotel. It felt like they were all hired temporarily. When I checked in, I clearly heard the front desk staff ask the room staff if there was any fruit that day, because there were gold card members staying, but it was a pity that I didn‚Äôt see the fruit after staying for three days;
Supporting facilities: I came here for the water park this time, but it didn‚Äôt open on the first day because there were few people. I said it would open the next day, but I went there on the second night and was told that the water was too cold to play. On the third day, it was still there. The water is very cold, and the main feature of the hotel is the water park. I understand that this kind of preparation should be done in advance, not when all the guests come to the door.

msg:In general, it is great. Beijing is hot these days, it is very cool here, and the night is breezy. The water park is very interesting. Although there are only slides, the children will not get tired of playing all day. The water in the water park is a little cold. In addition to the large water park, there is also a separate swimming pool with suitable water temperature. Not many people during the week, crowded on weekends. In addition to the water park, there is an indoor children's playground and a real children's playground. Definitely have fun with kids! The most unsatisfactory thing is the food and beverages. The hotel has only one restaurant, Caifeng Restaurant, which is ridiculously expensive! Outside the hotel, there are no restaurants around!

You can play without leaving the hotel. There are many projects. The only downside is that the variety of breakfast is a bit small, other Chinese food and dinner taste average, the overall hotel is very good üëåüòå

An afternoon tea shop is provided in the lobby. Check-in is orderly and the processing speed is very fast. Both the first day check-in and renewal have caught up with Lei Cheng at the front desk. The business is very familiar. A few words explain the difference in room types, advantages and disadvantages, and differences in booking packages.

msg:Staying for two nights, the experience in this hotel is very poor. First of all, the location is very bad, there is nothing around, only a bunch of unfinished buildings. Second, the ticket inspection methods for water parks and children‚Äôs parks are very unreasonable. Guests staying in the hotel can buy two large and one small amu*****t passes, which can enter and exit multiple times during the stay, but after buying the tickets, the staff will issue you three A cloth bracelet that you can wear on your hand. The design of this bracelet is that you can‚Äôt take it off once you put it on. You can only cut it off with scissors when you leave the store, which means we have to wear this bracelet for three days. I have to wear it no matter if it gets wet or whatever. I find it very uncomfortable, but the staff has been forcing me to wear it. Personally, I think the hotel has no right to do so. Why do I have to be forced to wear it for the three days I stayed in the hotel? Wearing this broken bracelet like a dog chain, they just simplified the process of checking their tickets, but they put the burden on the guests, and they really dislike this approach. Third, the hotel‚Äôs management of its staff is very poor. Several young staff members in the outdoor children‚Äôs playground blatantly smoked there. They were all children playing there. They smoked secondhand smoke for a long time, which was terrible.

Especially like the water park, the children enjoy the water slides. The breakfast is quite satisfactory, the taste of the Chinese restaurant is okay, and there are more people on holiday. The hotel has its own courtyard, so you can enjoy a relaxing stroll. There are not many people in the Mahjong room, so you can play once you go. The overall experience is good, suitable for parent-child holiday. It is relatively close to Wild Duck Lake.
