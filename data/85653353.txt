msg:As soon as I entered the manor, I felt another space. It is a homestay with pursuit and warmth. It is the absolute first choice for those who like quiet and private enjoyment. I stayed for two nights and it rained all day. I read books, listened to music and the sound of rain in the room. I got rid of the previous fatigue and completely completed a recharge. I felt that my whole body was creating positive cells.

Let me talk about a few more features:

1. The restaurant is delicious. I experienced breakfast and dinner. The Chinese food prepared by the chef with fresh ingredients of the day was very good. The children at home were very happy.

2. The housekeeper and staff are very friendly and warm. They also helped us arrange a VIP boat tour to the manor in the wetland park on the other side.

3. The room is very large. Those who like wooden pastoral style will definitely enjoy it. It has the comfort of home, and the various facilities are of high standards and very online. A family of three stayed in the room for a whole day and felt that it was not enough.

Anyway, I felt that there was nothing comparable to this place when I experienced it at the first stop of this trip. The experience far exceeded all kinds of five-star hotels. I hope I will have the opportunity to experience it in different seasons in the future.

msg:Yaoguang room, stayed for three nights. The purpose of the long vacation is to be quiet, relax and enjoy. The Anadu has achieved the purpose✅. The hotel is located in the suburbs of Changxing County, which is very private. The room is spacious and well-equipped. One thing that must be said is that there are a lot of French windows and windows in the room, but there is no light after the curtains are lowered. For someone like me who cares a lot about the sleeping environment, it is very rare. The hotel owner's attentiveness in design details can also be seen. The service staff is also very dedicated, and they try their best to meet the guests' requirements. Breakfast was delivered to the room for two days, and it was hot on time and tasted good. Overall, it is a good place to relax. But because we flew across the province and spent 4100+ per night to relax, I have to mention two regrets on the premise of understanding the difficulties of the operators: 1. The hotel has too few dining options, only set meals, the price is 380 yuan/person, and there are few types of set meals (oh, there are simple meals ~ only porridge noodles, but the taste is really unbearable). You must know that the hotel is very remote (it is not easy to get a Didi), and there are almost no commercial places around. The hotel's catering should be more diversified, giving guests more choices, plus the size of the set meal is really a bit too much for two middle-aged and elderly people. They can't finish it every time they eat hard, and it's really not good to waste. But I still have to admit that the dishes of the two set meals we have eaten are still very well made. 2. There is a timber factory next to the hotel. It starts work at 7 o'clock and less than 8 o'clock every morning. The sound of sawing wood will continue until noon, which is quite annoying. I asked the hotel and the answer was "When the hotel was opened, the village promised to move out as soon as possible, but it has not moved" 😭. During the National Day holiday, they work half a day every day. I don't know what it will be like at other times. This will indeed be a problem for guests. Overall, this is a hotel that is carefully designed and has good design taste. It is very nice to experience it. I heard that the owner has developed another hotel not far away. I hope the hotel will have a chance to experience it next time. I wish the hotel business will be prosperous and get better and better!

選擇了湖州長興的Anadu橄欖莊園
對於i人夫婦👫來説
去山裡度過假期時間總是不錯的選擇
	
🗺️路線
上海到湖州長興沒有直達高鐵
需要在南京南或者杭州東中轉
總時長在 2-2.5h
管家會提前在高鐵站等候
莊園離高鐵站車程為 30min
很便捷
	
🌲環境
莊園處於一個小山坡下
經過大片的茶園和竹林後
就能看到帳篷風的客房了
9個帳篷以北斗星的形狀坐落在繁茂的樹間
私密性還算不錯
	
⛺️房間
內部裝修最能看到莊園主人的品味
我們入住的是璇璣
在木頭和紗幔配合下
帳篷內流淌着暖色調的氣氛
正值初夏
每一個窗口像是一幅畫
雖然蚊蟲也多了起來
但清脆的鳥叫聲伴着初夏的風
還是愜意🐈
	
在設施和服務上也足見莊園主人的用心
🧘♀️立式吹風機和zmind冥想墊，洞察到了住客想逃離紛擾，享受慵懶時間的痛點
👓 AR眼鏡給到了更沉浸的觀影體驗
💁♂️一對一的管家服務，提前提供菜單，準備妥當一日三餐。
🥬餐食方面是根據人數來預訂，總體來説，中式菜品的味道更好，每道菜都很美味。
🌃夜床服務和貼心的床品選擇，眼罩、熱牛奶、薰衣草和蕎麥枕頭，能夠照顧到不同的睡眠需求
🥏娛樂方面也給到了完整的清單，採摘楊梅，橄欖皂製作，無患子手串製作，露天電影等，不同季節體驗不同的項目。
🐰莊園還有自己養的小兔子，2 個月的兔寶寶超級可愛軟糯～

msg:兩年前入住過anadu和平莊園印象非常深刻，所以找了一個得空的春日週末又選擇了橄欖莊園，總體是一次超出預期的入住。

從莊園環境設施到管家服務都很滿意。帳篷式的外觀和院落以及內部空間的精巧與舒適，衹有到了酒店才能直觀感受到。相當推薦逃離城市的人們來放放空。

最後感謝工作人員貼心的手寫卡片、小禮物、給到攜狗家庭的禮包以及幫忙挖筍的師傅！

希望很快能再相見～

msg:這家酒店是新開的，裂牆推薦，不是託！Anadu旗下的橄欖莊園，果然出精品，每一户入住，依然都配備私人管家，這次的私人管家是李敏，服務特別到位，很細心很貼心，隨時呼喚都能給到滿意的服務，在不方面出去的時候，還很貼心的幫忙買了隨身貼身用品。酒店配備設施，應該是住過那麼多裏面，算是很上乘，全套歐舒丹的洗浴用品，加上貓王音響，還有自助脱手的吹風機，以及Marvis的牙膏，還有咖啡機，直温水，一應俱全，冰箱飲品也是常規自助。風景是一大片橄欖樹園，不下雨的時候可以户外燒烤和高爾夫，還能就近古道玩一玩。早餐和中午的簡餐，都由管家送餐到房間，可以在房間發呆一整天。晚餐在餐廳預訂的雙人中餐，人均300左右。夜晚在隔壁，可以小酌一杯雞尾酒🍹，感覺非常好👍🏻。整體住下來，非常非常滿意，整個都是獨棟的小帳篷式⛺️別墅，屋頂頂部在下雨的時候，就會聽見雨滴落在屋頂頂布的滴滴雨聲，非常舒適非常愜意，這種工作之餘的度假放鬆，對於想在一個地方發呆，呆著不動的人，非常友好，希望能越做越好，還會再來！！

msg:春節假期，找個地方放鬆一下。之前去過anadu和平莊園，很是喜歡，看到他們橄欖莊園新開業，正好去感受一下。沒想到佔地面積比和平莊園還要大，150畝僅九間野奢帳篷客房 ，立於橄欖園和茶山、竹林的山間深處 ，視野很開闊，有恆温泳池（這個天太冷，還是沒敢去遊😂）每間帳篷都有獨立的院落，空間很大，聽説大的有一百多平方，基礎也有七十平，私密性很好，管家式服務，很注重儀式感，帶入客房時還點上了茶葉香薰，沉浸式體驗了身處茶林的味道。莊園主應該是個絕對的細節主義，所使用的東西也很人性化，有品質。難得有“野”不完的自然美景 又有人性温度的一家酒店。很好體現了出於自然 融入自然 這句話。愛上這種放空心靈的好地方，下次還會再來。
