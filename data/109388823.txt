The room is clean and tidy, the facilities are smart, the decoration is high-end, the service staff is very good, they will take the initiative to say hello, there are many extended services, the price we booked also gave us free tickets to the botanical garden and sent us to Taizhou High-speed Railway Station. The driver's service is also very good, and he called me ten minutes in advance to inform me. In short, this trip is really the most satisfying stay I have had in all these years. 𠆤People think that Wyndham pays attention to quality, details and service. If a five-star hotel can achieve this, it is professional. Thumbs up for the hotel👍

The experience was very good from the check-in. There was welcome tea and hot towels, and the room was given two breakfasts. Opposite the hotel is a small botanical garden, and each room was given two tickets to the botanical garden.
The bedding in the room was comfortable, and the bathroom supplies were also very good. The lake view room facing the botanical garden has a good view.
It is worth mentioning that the hotel gym is very large and has a complete range of equipment! The swimming pool is also heated and the water is very clean.
Finally, when I left the hotel, the hotel also gave a small gift, which was very thoughtful!

msg:The hardware facilities are very good. The breakfast categories are also quite rich. A little disappointed. All front desk and restaurant waiters on the first floor lack professional knowledge and need more training. For example: When checking in, I asked what the size of a bed in a twin room is? 1.2 meters or 1.35 meters? The waiter answered about 1.5 meters. It shocked me. I have never heard of a single bed with a door width of 1.5 meters after staying in a hotel. Secondly, in the restaurant on the first floor, I said that I need to take a look at the a la carte menu. #waited for so long. He said he didn't have the password for the tablet and had to wait for the manager to see the menu. Is this reasonable? Give up decisively. I hope that such good hardware facilities will not be wasted and affect the experience of every guest.

Let's talk about the hardware first. The new hotel opened in 23 years. There is no peculiar smell. The room is also very clean. The bedding is really extremely comfortable. The swimming pool and gym are also top-notch. I highly recommend it!
But in fact, the most attentive thing is the hot towels from the beginning of check-in, the fruit in the room, the guide to check-in, the introduction of room functions, and the desserts prepared on the night bed. You can see from the details that the service of a hotel is very attentive
Especially the lobby manager Carrie forgot to print some materials during the stay. When it was very urgent, she tried her best to help solve it. I am really grateful!

Later, the Ctrip guy intervened and I was satisfied. I saw that the sanitation was not even with a trash bag in the trash can, but the room was big. There are few places to eat around here. I suggest staying here and eating out before coming back. The facilities still have a decoration smell. In short, it's new. The room is equipped with a purifier, but the air conditioner doesn't seem to be online. It's on for a while and not for a while. I've stayed in other hotels for a long time and there's no such problem. It may be to save costs. The breakfast is satisfactory, just like that, it's okay. I don't want to come next time because it's inconvenient to travel.

I contacted the room service several times, but the TV sometimes worked and sometimes didn't. It was completely up to luck. I spent money on a five-star hotel, but the place I stayed was worse than an ordinary business hotel... I haven't come across a worse hotel than this one at this price (1300+), I suggest you avoid it.

I was very tired after playing that day, so I waited for them to fix it for me to take a shower. But they couldn't fix it after a long time, and then they told me that they couldn't fix it, or I had to change rooms. I really laughed. This is the attitude of a hotel to solve a problem. Not an apology, but a cold "can't fix it"

msg:We booked a room on a temporary basis. It was almost midnight when we arrived at the hotel. There were not many parking spaces on the second floor. They were all full. We could only park against the wall. Wyndham is actually together with Ramada. Entering the hotel from the parking lot to find the front desk was like walking into a maze. The sign system was not clear, and the spaces on the second floor were all dark, which was very confusing. The front desk on the first floor, which was closer to the guest room, was empty during the day, and we had to go through the lobby to another front desk to check in. In short, it was very troublesome. After checking in, the guy sent us to the elevator and told me on the way that he wanted to give me a Starbucks drink coupon on the condition that I immediately gave a five-star review on Ctrip and took photos for evidence. I replied that the review must be written after 14:00 after the hotel leaves. Well, the guest hasn't even entered the room yet, and I have to use a coffee coupon to buy the guest's good review. This review is too "cheap"! The room is large, and when I opened the curtains, I saw the dormitory with upper and lower bunks for hotel employees. There is no bathtub, which should not meet the five-star standard. The air conditioner does not cool, and the window cannot be opened. It was hot all night. I went for breakfast at 9am, and there were few pastries left, and there was no additional food. The variety was not very good. After leaving the hotel, I found that some clothes were left behind, so I called the front desk and hoped that we could pick them up directly from the front desk after returning. As a result, they made a room card for me and asked me to go back to the room to get it. I was unhappy when I left, and asked for a coffee coupon. The front desk once again asked for a good review. So the hotel, you should explain, are the coffee coupons used to entertain normal guests, or to bribe guests? You want guests to give you good reviews against their will for a coffee coupon? Do you think the guest's hotel experience and Ctrip's evaluation system are worthless?

msg:First of all, thank you Steven, the hotel director. He is the only hotel manager who felt that the service was in place and worked seriously after I checked in...
Although the whole hotel is very new, the service and hardware are not up to par...At the front desk, we asked for three rooms together, and they agreed verbally, but the room they gave was really far away, just on the same floor...When I took a shower at night, the water was still not hot after 10 minutes of running. Since I was already naked, I could only take a cold shower. I called the guest room. A housekeeper came first. After a quick look, she couldn't solve the problem. She sent a young girl who was probably the supervisor. She touched the water pipe and said that there was a section of cold water in it. It would be fine if I let it run for a while. She also questioned that we didn't know how to use the faucet. Then I said that it had been running for 20 minutes. She reluctantly came and said that she was the manager of the catering depar**ent. Even more awesome, she said that she would send someone to take me to the hospital now, and then said that the water temperature was indeed cold but it was okay to take a shower...I asked them to go in and take a shower. Don't we know the difference between cold water and water temperature? If they wash and it's not cold, I will bear it... Anyway, a series of operations made me angry... Then the faucet repairman came and stepped on the faucet for 10 minutes before fixing it. No one came to clean up afterwards... I was furious, and the director Steven came... First of all, he apologized, instead of directly questioning us that we didn't know how to turn on the faucet like the previous three people, and didn't apologize, let alone service... Steven changed our room immediately, after all, it was nearly 10 o'clock in the evening, let us rest first, and immediately understood what happened and explained and apologized to us, this is the service of a five-star hotel...
The hotel's training for staff is really bad... The breakfast is very bad, that's all... There are many staff in the lobby every day, but it seems that the tables can never be cleaned up. We wanted to sit at a table for breakfast and the manager was cleaning it. He told me that it would take at least 15 minutes to clean it and asked me to eat somewhere else. It takes 15 minutes to clean a table? ...Other staff members didn't clean up the tables after they finished eating, but we kept cleaning up the tables while we were eating. Are they trying to drive us away? ...For 4 consecutive days, there was always a shortage of food for breakfast, and no one ever replenished it. The tables were never cleaned up. When asked, they just said they just arrived and didn't know...
It's a new hotel, but the decoration is obviously very rough. The floor seams in some rooms are warped...I slept for 4 days, and they didn't change the sheets...
To be honest, if a hotel only has one professional director, it's really a long way to go to achieve a five-star rating by relying on one person...

msg:A newly opened hotel with new facilities, high configuration, large area, and the front desk concierge took the initiative to lead. The first impression was good. I have to complain about what happened later: but the location is relatively remote, and there is no supporting facilities around except the botanical garden. The guest room window faces the mountain, and there is actually a tomb at the foot of the mountain. The hygiene and service have to complain about the hotel breakfast. The breakfast service during the National Day was not up to par, and the dishes were not replenished in time. For a newly opened hotel, it is understandable that the service may not keep up with the large flow of customers. The most bizarre thing is that after taking a bite, I found that the raspberries on the small cake were moldy. I called the service staff in a shirt (probably the supervisor or manager), took a look, and the whole process was silent. He took the cake away directly, thinking that he would come to apologize and say hello later. In the end, I didn't say an apology until I left the restaurant. Generally, when I encounter this kind of situation in a restaurant, I will not ask for compensation or the like, just a friendly reminder, but there was no apology throughout the whole process. As a five-star chain brand hotel, this is the first time I have encountered such a situation.

The only complaint is: the hotel parking lot is on the second floor. From the parking lot to the hotel and walk to the elevator, there is a large section of public area and swimming pool fitness area. The public area is still brightly lit at night. , but after the swimming pool and fitness area are closed at night, the aisle is not lit, only the lights of the camera and the safety exit, it is too dark
Service: It is worthy of being a five-star hotel, and I feel the five-star service! From the moment I entered the hotel, the assistant manager at the check-in lobby (Miss Ruan Haixia) gave me warm guidance, and then delivered it to the room and helped me with my luggage. I asked about the local snacks and attractions, and they all introduced them in detail. After a day of fun, return to the hotel in the evening and serve freshly cooked white fungus porridge. Really considerate!

新開的酒店，設施肯定是好的。我看了以前的評價，一些不理想的狀況，這次都沒有遇到，可見經營服務團隊是認真總結，在進步的。
早餐品質非常高，當地特色美食味道太好了，麪食檔的阿姨態度親切。如果以後再來台州，為了早餐也會考慮選擇温德姆。

優點
1、服務很熱情 車子一到 就有人主動來開車門 拿行李 有專人陪同辦理房卡 送到房間
2、入住前有人提前聯繫 加了微信 會提前詢問喜歡什麼房間 有什麼需求 幾點到店等 很貼心 辦理入住速度很快 提到的要求都有滿足
3、房間佈局合理 電動窗簾 智能馬桶 智能鏡子 住起來很舒服 房間裏有空氣凈化器 因此雖然是新的酒店 味道不大

唯一的缺點就是早餐廳通風不好 導致有油煙味
