msg:I loved the lake view from my room, and highly recommend higher floors.
The bathtub with the open view was also amazing,the beds were soft and sleek.
However,I would not rate this hotel as 5 stars; the decor is quite old with its dark colours, a bit worn out wallpapers and quite old carpets in the corridor.

It was very noisy with lots of families and their kids.
Buliding 1 has two lifts only and you end up waiting and being squashed  in a lift all the time.

Coming down to breakfast restaurant was about strange as the lift takes you to the basement parking so one needs to go past the cars unless you want to walk outside the building.The breakfast was buzzing with too many people impatient to que politely.

Most importantly, I really feel the front desk service needs a lot of improvement; I understand that  nobody speaks English, we can use translators,but noone welcomed me properly and wished me a nice stay: my Alipay and passport only mattered.

I was lucky with Xio Qian ( front desk boy) who offered to help and share the information about amenities and trips around the lake. I am very grateful to him.

The gym in building 5 was a disappointment;
One swimming pool is  to be shared between 4 other buildings. Because it rained, the water was quite cold in the pool.

Overall,this hotel would suit families and kids mainly,but i would not recommend it to single expats and certainly would not rate it as a 5 star hotel.

msg:The hotel price is enough high and our expectation was also higher, but the reality is different.  rooms are ok, they gave us a corner room and the view wasn't so good, I booked a bit more expensive for the lake view, but got disappointed with it after my check in and they said there wasn't other choice, all were taken already.   The worse  thing is their swimming pool,  the main one for adults were all the time very cold, the water was frozen, we asked the reason and no response.  we couldn't enjoy the swimming pool during our 5 days stay.  the another one for kids was too dirty,  haven't cleaned it for a while obviously,  already smelly like a muddy puddle.  even kids were asking why the water was that dirty.  The resort includes 5 huge buildings and all were full.  super crowded and all the people do use the only one swimming pool and the only one breakfast area.  the breakfast was OK many choices of food, but it's impossible to enjoy your meal cause the area isn't fresh or clean.  the floor was sticky.  I would say they need improve or they now how to make things better but they don't care.  especially for summer the swimming pool is so important for every guest but they seems wanna save money and not pay attention on it.  feel disgusting and unhealthy after all I saw there.

msg:We were really looking forward to our stay here after deciding to stay one more night in Qiandaohu. We wanted to spend our final night somewhere on the main lake with a pool to relax. We arrived early and checkin was prompt and the room was ready. However the ammenities for a ‚Äú5* resort‚Äù is a stretch. 

Upon checking in we were excited to sit by the pool and have a drink and relax. This is not the case. We purchased 2 beers and then told we couldn‚Äôt drink them at our chairs. Followed by rules of not being able to swim without ‚Äúproper swimming attire‚Äù meaning we had to wear swim caps. Kind of takes away from the romance of relaxing by the pool. The mob of lifeguards were more like a gang rather than friendly staff and the hotel is more family friendly than couple getaway vibe. Meaning the pool is kids only. Even the larger pool next door at the Sheraton was closed off during the summer?!?!?! Don‚Äôt understand. 

Once we lowered our expectations of the venue we enjoyed our final day here but definitely needs attention regarding service and clientele needs. No where to eat except one restaurant next door at the Sheraton. The saving grace was our room view where we enjoyed the sunset and gorgeous lake view. 

If you‚Äôre a couple looking for 5* quality and services I would spend more $$ and try the Hilton or Intercontinental.

msg:My friend and I visited Qiandao Lake looking for a little bit of luxury and an escape from the city. Greentown Resort claims itself to be a 5* hotel but it is definitely not. It‚Äôs more like a 3.5 star hotel in terms of the level of luxury you feel there. I think we were both disappointed when we arrived. That being said, if you go with the expectation of staying at a 3.5* then I think you‚Äôll be happy with what you get. Some good aspects are: overall cleanliness, soft beds, and the lake view (if you opt for that). It is located near the town center so there are some local options for food. This is important to note because Greentown does not have its own restaurant outside of what is provided for breakfast, which means you are required to find alternatives. This resort seems to be a residential buildings that they turned into a hotel that spans over 5 or so buildings. Right in the center of that is a well known luxury hotel that has a beautiful, large outdoor pool which is not accessible to Greentown patrons unless you want to pay 258rmb for a day pass. Greentown does have a pool located in building 1 but it is significantly smaller. In the afternoon, from around 11-2:30 the pool seemed to be abandoned and at that time there was a beautiful view and a peaceful atmosphere. However, after 2:30, the pool becomes increasingly and overwhelmingly jam packed with children (in the attached photo you can see the early part of this. By about 4:00 it was completely full). If you are coming with kids, this might be a positive thing, but was not the scene we were after. Generally speaking, it is just too small to serve 5 or 6 whole buildings of guests. 

I think price wise, this is a fine option. The hotel isn‚Äôt ‚Äúbad‚Äù but it just isn‚Äôt great: as long as you have a healthy understanding of what to expect it may be a fine option for a stay in that area.

msg:I booked a standard room in Building 1, but when I arrived, I was given a lake view room on the 9th floor of Unit 3, Building 1. The lake view was almost 1/4 blocked by Sheraton Building 2. I heard that Building 3 is the only one of the three buildings in Greentown that is not blocked. If you want a full lake view, you can book Building 3. Building 1 is fine for families with children. Downstairs of Unit 3, Building 1 is a children's playground with a covered outdoor slide, indoor ocean balls and foam building blocks. Downstairs of Unit 1 next to it is a covered outdoor slide and swing for young children. Since there is no indoor swimming pool, the outdoor swimming pool was opened in May, but the opening hours are relatively short and it closes at 5 pm. Moreover, the children's pool is not open, so it is not recommended for those who want to take their babies swimming. The service is okay. There is no butler service. I informed in advance that I would bring children, but they only gave children toothbrushes and slippers after checking in. Aunt Xu and Aunt Hu from the room service later gave a rabbit doll, which the baby loved. I don't know if it's because there are children, but welcome fruits are delivered every day, so there is no need to buy fruits outside. The breakfast buffet has a wide variety of dishes and tastes good. The best part is the lake view. If the weather is good, you can sit outside and enjoy the view with a cup of coffee.

The side view is slightly blocked, but you can still see the lake view. Breakfast is at the hotel's buffet, the scenery is great, and you can have a cup of coffee by the lake. When checking out, I was in a hurry and met a tour group. Thanks to the help of Xiao Ni (Ni) at the front desk, I checked out smoothly.

The hotel is in a very good location, with complete facilities and impeccable hygiene. You can see the sunset from the viewing balcony. The breakfast provided by the restaurant on the first floor is rich. It is very comfortable to have breakfast by the lake with the breeze. From the lobby to the floor, the waiters are very polite, considerate and thoughtful. In particular, the two floor waiters Xu Xiaoli and Xu Yuanlan left a very good impression on us. Great üëç.

All the regular needs raised by the guests were not solved, but all directly responded No! No! If the hotel did not have a sign, it would make guests feel like a state-owned guesthouse in the 1970s and 1980s!
Restaurant: Neat and clean, there are many kinds of food (Chinese, local, Western, slightly thin, only three kinds of sausages, no cheese) The outdoor lakeside dining area has a great experience! The aunties who cleaned the tableware were very diligent and kept cleaning the leftovers and tableware on the table. Like üëç

Special feedback: I don‚Äôt know if the old aunt at the restaurant‚Äôs noodle stall owes her salary or has encountered some troubles recently? For several consecutive breakfasts, I saw her looking "very unhappy" the whole time (if that's the case, I suggest you take a break and don't bring negative energy to the guests who are on vacation). The guest asked why her facial muscles were in a state of stiffness! The muscles in her mouth were more like necrosis? She was out of tune with the overall excellent restaurant team.

The room is super big! The balcony is also! Although 1/3 of the view is blocked by the Sheraton, it is still beautiful! The suite has two bathrooms and basic kitchen facilities (microwave and induction cooker, I don‚Äôt know if they can be used)
Let‚Äôs talk about hygiene: the hygiene of the main areas is very good. There are just some stains (food) left by previous guests on the wall that have not been wiped off.
The room is indeed a bit old, but it is very good overall! The independent cloakroom is not small. By the way, another disadvantage is that the curtain in the bathroom is light-transmissive... People inside will be seen clearly when they take a shower or go to the toilet at night, which is a bit embarrassing.
I am really satisfied with this stay. The big balcony is very comfortable. My dad and I sit on the balcony from time to time to drink tea and wine, look at the scenery and play with mobile phones.
Next time I will try Sheraton or Building 2 and Building 3, the balcony view will be better!

It happened to be raining, so the elderly could sit on the large balcony to enjoy the lake view. I was really grateful! 
The two large beds in the parent-child suite were just enough for our family of three. Breakfast was in the independent restaurant downstairs (we later learned that the elevator could reach the underground, so we went out outside looking at the ground signs). There were a lot of varieties, and a double bicycle around the lake was given as a gift (self-paid deposit of 200). I quickly experienced it in the half hour when the rain stopped. 
There is also a children's playground downstairs, so you can take your baby out even if it rains. It is very convenient to take a taxi from the hotel, and I am very satisfied with the check-in experience!

The takeaway is not delivered to the upper floor, and the guests have to go down to get it by themselves. The food is on the table at the door, and they don't consider whether it is inconvenient for the guests to come down to get it. The epidemic has passed. If you are worried about insecurity, you can buy a robot. The hotel lets the robot deliver the food upstairs, which is convenient for the guests and the hotel. In addition, there is no trash can under the sink in the hotel's bathroom, which is very inconvenient for girls. They have to go to the toilet to throw away the garbage, and throw it in the trash can next to the toilet. The hotel auntie is not very careful when cleaning, and she loses things everywhere. The most important thing is that as a five-star hotel, the braised eggs for breakfast were not sold out the day before and were repeatedly heated and served to the guests. It's outrageous. When I peeled the eggs, the egg shells and egg whites fell off together, and the egg whites were broken. This situation only occurs when the eggs are repeatedly heated. I hope the hotel will improve it.

I live in Building 5. I feel that the facilities are very old. The gym equipment is broken and has not been repaired. The pool table is even worse. The welcome fruits are too perfunctory (see picture)
The breakfast is quite rich, but there are so many people that we can't find a table
The scenery around the lake is very good. It‚Äôs nice to ride a bicycle and stroll around the lake. However, the scenery is only that of Qiandao Lake. You can also visit other hotels.

With a doll, the perfect combination of parent and child is warm and considerate. The two waiters, Wang Hongnv and Hu Quanjuan, were attentive and considerate.

msg:I stayed here once in 2020 and had a good experience.
So I came here to stay for a few days during the Chinese New Year.
Let me talk about the advantages: the room is large. The facilities are complete, the balcony faces Qiandao Lake, and the scenery is good. The service was good and the room was cleaned very well. The service staff I saw were very friendly and greeted me warmly.
Let‚Äôs talk about the shortcomings: the same room type is smaller than the room we stayed in last time. There were too many people in the cafeteria in the morning, so there was relatively less food. The replenishment was not very timely.
Let‚Äôs talk about three more areas that need improvement:
1Ninth and tenth photos. This corner is easy to hit. People coming out on the left and right cannot see the people on the opposite side. Especially in the morning when eating breakfast is very dangerous.
2The children's facility in my room is basketball. The last time I stayed there was a billiard table. I called the front desk and asked if it could be changed. Because my children prefer to play table tennis. Then the front desk told me that this was fixed and could not be changed. Can it be adjusted more humanely?
3. I had to take the high-speed train back at 8 a.m. on the fourth day, so I checked out of the room at 6:30. I read online that breakfast can be had at 6:30. Then when I arrived, I found that the official meal didn't start until 7 o'clock. I asked the restaurant staff and asked if they could pack some breakfast for me to eat on the way if I came at 6:30. Buns and bread would also work. After all, I have a child, and I am afraid that the child will be hungry, but adults can tolerate it for a while. Then the answer I got was that dinner would start on time at 7:00. The restaurant is empty before 7:00. This answer is amazing. Because I have encountered similar situations in other hotels. The restaurant will pack a breakfast for me in advance and let me take it with me on the road. This is purely a personal suggestion.

There is indeed a problem with the odor in the toilet. I didn't feel it on the first day, but it started to smell very bad on the second day.
Hygiene: It can be seen that the cleaning lady is very careful in cleaning. The room is clean and tidy, and the smell is fresh. The smell of water in the toilet can only be said to be a problem with the hotel facilities, not the cleaning problem.
Environment: Facing Qiandao Lake, high floors are unobstructed. The resort is rich in greenery and well managed. Walking along the lake is refreshing.
Service: There was a surprise at the beginning of check-in. The front desk gave me a pack of snacks and toys for children. Room service was prompt. I asked for toilet paper at night and it was delivered within 5 minutes. The next day, I met Aunt Zheng Aiwen who was cleaning the room. She was really nice. When she saw that we had brought children, she gave her a little yellow duck suit bag, which also included a set of baby toiletries. On the third day, she asked us to After checking out, we were given a bag of oranges for us to eat on the way, which really made us feel at home. In addition, the hotel's toiletries and hand cream are all grapefruit-flavored, which smells very good. I plan to go back and buy a set for use~

msg:A very cost-effective hotel. I was a little hesitant at first when I read the reviews, but then I thought about how I mainly went out to visit tourist attractions in the first few days after coming to Qiandao Lake, and finally decided to choose a hotel that was cost-effective and convenient for travel. I originally booked Building 5, but the hotel called me in advance to inform me of the upgrade to Building 1. I just had to go directly to Building 1 to check in. After arriving at the hotel, I felt much better than expected. The room was large and clean, the design was reasonable and convenient, and the furniture was well maintained. The floor and location given had a good view, and the scenery was very good, so I decided to extend it for one more day. Every waiter I encountered during my stay was nice, enthusiastic and proactive. The breakfast is rich and tastes good. The hotel is located in the center of Chun'an County. It is also very convenient for eating and shopping. It is suitable for family travel. If I come to Qiandao Lake in the future, I will choose Greentown Hotel again.

Maybe because of the off-season, Ms. Fang at the hotel front desk upgraded us to a suite for free that day, and also gave us welcome snacks for the children. We were pleasantly surprisedüòÅ This time we stayed in a very spacious and comfortable stay. When we left, the check-out time was different from the train driving time. After a long separation, after communicating with Ms. Ni Lijuan and Ms. Teng Hui at the front desk, they agreed to let us stay for a while after checking out before setting off.

If I had time, I would really like to stay a few more days. The scenery on the 14th floor is very good. We stayed in a family lake view suite for 399, with 3 breakfasts and Oulon toiletries. There was no welcome fruit or anything else, but we were given two cups of Starbucks. We were able to accommodate four adults and a baby. However, compared to the five-star Sheraton next door, the air conditioning in their entire hotel is not turned off. If there is no one here, the children's playground will not have air conditioning at all times, so just play in the room. But now is the off-season, so cost savings are understandable.

The floor service staff Hong Mary and Zhou Zhenlian, as well as the service staff who call 23 to deliver things, are all very good and the service is enthusiastic. However, the front desk service in Building 5 is relatively poor and unenthusiastic. They basically ask and answer questions without saying a word. For example, when we asked where the children's amu*****t park was, we just answered that it was in Building 1. We didn't even say that if we wanted to go there, we could ask for a courtesy car to take us there. We thought we had to go there on our own, but at first we thought it might be like this at the Greentown front desk. Service, I went to Building 1 and Building 3 and found that the service was completely different. Basically, in addition to answering questions, I also asked a few more questions. For example, if I went to the Children's Park, Building 3 would say that I can help you if you want to go. Take a courtesy car to send you there. There is also a children's playground, which may be due to winter. It is not the peak season. It opens at 10 o'clock. Even after 10 o'clock, an employee came to open the door, and the lights inside were not turned on, so it was a bit dark. The outside part is semi-open and has no air conditioning, but the inside part has air conditioning. It was only after turning on the air conditioning that I started to consider turning on the air conditioning. It was so cold that you still had to take off your shoes. Even if there are cushions, you also need to take off your shoes on the floor. , I thought there was floor heating, but it turned out there wasn‚Äôt. Even the air conditioning couldn‚Äôt be turned on. The main feeling about this park was that it was cold and dark. However, this hotel has a good location and the surrounding area is quite prosperous.

Otherwise, if you park in Building 1 of Greentown Resort, you would have to drag your luggage to the very back. There are many shops in the surrounding area. It is convenient to go out on the left hand side of Building 5. There is also Lianhua Supermarket across the road. You can also shop at self-service machines, takeaways and many restaurants.

We lived in Building 3, with a good view without obstructions and an unobstructed view of the lake. Standing on the balcony, you can enjoy the scenery of Qiandao Lake, which is really relaxing and free of worries.

You can ride downstairs along the lake, and there is a cafe. It is very pleasant to take a walk in the morning and evening. The children's playground is in Building 1, a few minutes walk, or you can take the hotel's battery car.

There are many restaurants around the hotel, and the snacks from "My Sister's House" are nearby and taste good. It takes about 25 minutes to take a taxi to the high-speed rail station.

Xiao Qian, the front office staff, was very warm and considerate. He added WeChat in advance to confirm the check-in time, sent travel guides, upgraded the room type, and gave away coffee coupons. The lady at the front desk gave us a gift pack of snacks for the children. The room staff, Sister Wang, prepared fruits for us and the room was cleaned very well.

msg:This time I visited Qiandao Lake and stayed in the parent-child room in Building 3 of the hotel. I was very satisfied. It feels like the room was recently renovated. It has a panoramic view of the lake, is clean and tidy, and has parent-child furnishings that children like. The front desk staff has a good attitude and patiently helps solve problems. The decoration of the restaurant feels high-end, and the breakfast food is rich in variety and delicious. All in all, this stay was a very good experience. Thank you to the hotel for the great value for money service!

msg:I took my 80-year-old parents to visit Qiandao Lake. I read the reviews on Ctrip and chose the parent-child suite of this Greentown Resort Hotel. As it was the off-season, the hotel upgraded the room for free and also gave us a one-hour cycling voucher for two people.
The scenery from the balcony of the lake view room is beautiful, and the Moonlight Island in the distance is clearly visible. The location is excellent. You can walk to the Earl and Night Cruise Pier in 15 minutes. There are supermarkets and restaurants outside the hotel, which is very convenient.
Special thanks to Manager Ye Xiaofeng, receptionist Ms. Fang Jinlan, and room service Ms. Zheng Aiwen.
My parents were very satisfied with the hotel and left a good impression on their trip to Qiandao Lake!
It is recommended to install handrails in toilets and shower rooms to facilitate the use of the elderly!
If I have the chance to visit Qiandao Lake again, I will choose Greentown again!

msg:I took my parents to visit Qiandao Lake while the weather was not too cold. November is also the off-season for Qiandao Lake tourism, and there are not too many people. I booked the most popular Greentown Resort Hotel and chose the family suite in Building 1. It was super large and very comfortable for three people. All rooms and living rooms have large terraces facing the lake and the scenery is great. Fang Jieqin, the staff who handled the check-in process, was very enthusiastic and patiently explained the details of the check-in. She also presented drinks, snacks, and three Starbucks coffee coupons, which made people feel at home, and was particularly well received! Breakfast is on the ba*****t floor. The place is quite large, the variety is rich, and you will be full. There are many people who eat fish head soup near the entrance of the hotel. I chose Fish Apo, which is very good. The price is moderate, the dishes are large, and the service is also very good. Went there for dinner and lunch the next day. The hotel is very close to Tianyu Mountain and the Central Lake District Pier. It only takes seven or eight minutes to take a taxi. In short, it is very convenient.

The balcony is also very large, with lounge chairs, round tables, and chairs. Drinking tea, admiring the scenery, and eating melon seeds is very pleasant.
Check-in is also very fast and no deposit is required. The same goes for checking out, just return the card. Fang Guinv, the cleaning aunt, was so kind. When she saw that my husband wanted to make tea, she gave me a few extra bottles of water and some oranges. Be warm and courteous. Thumbs up! !
The breakfast in the hotel is okay and the environment is great. You can dine while looking at the lake view, which is very comfortable.

Not only was the hotel environment very good, but it was also very clean. It is probably the off-season because of the summer vacation and National Day holiday. The merchant upgraded the room type. Although the scenery is not as good as the Sheraton, the view is also very wide, and the price is more cost-effective. In particular, I would like to praise the waitress at Hu Taoxiang.

msg:Booked a family suite with lake view in Building 5
I'm lucky. Room 1205 is almost facing the Coin Island on the lake. Although it is slightly blocked by Building 3, it is definitely the most cost-effective among the lake view rooms.
If you have a passport, please note that you can only check in at Building 1. The hotel shuttle bus will arrive in 2 minutes. I met several drivers who provided very good service. One of them knew that we were going to Building 1 for breakfast in the morning. My dad, who is old and carries a cane, drove to the entrance of the restaurant in the underground garage without having to walk an extra step. It was really friendly.
Opposite the entrance to Building 3 is the shuttle bus stop from the high-speed rail to the hotel. It costs 15 yuan per person and takes about 40 minutes to the high-speed rail station.
All the software facilities in the room are good. Although they are a bit old, the space is large enough. When you are too lazy to go out, it is also very comfortable to chat at the round table in the living room or sit on the balcony to enjoy the breeze.
Because it is a suite, you must pass through the living room when you go to the bathroom from the bedroom, so the bathroom door opens and closes loudly, which will greatly affect your sleep. You can use some oil. I thought about telling the front desk when I checked out, but I forgot.
The bed in the living room is very large, not a mini children's bed. It is very comfortable for a family of 3 adults. Although there is no light switch on the bedside, there is a small rechargeable flashlight.
Breakfast was also ok. The service staff were very nice. They made coffee and served it to the table. They were also very diligent in serving food. The breakfast in Building 1 has a little more variety and there are more people. After eating, you can go outside to take pictures with the lake view or ride a bicycle to digest it.
There is a small park in Building 3. It is very pleasant to walk around and take pictures in 10 minutes.

Later, the hotel upgraded us to a three-bedroom suite. The next day, manager Xiao Liu from the hotel's guest room depar**ent came to the room in person with a coffee gift box made by the hotel to express his apology, and also waived part of the room fee. Although there were some minor twists and turns, the hotel's follow-up handling still made the whole family very satisfied, especially for the little one. Manager Liu liked it. It is indeed a long-established five-star hotel. I will definitely choose this hotel again when I come to Qiandao Lake in the future.

msg:I didn't have high expectations after reading the reviews online, but I was really pleasantly surprised when I entered the room. The room is super large. The living room, master bedroom and balcony are both very large. There is even a dressing room. It doesn't say it is very old, it just gives people a very clean feeling.

However, the view of this suite is average, and the lake view is a bit blocked. Building 3 should be better, but there is a swimming pool, children's playground, and breakfast room below Building 1, which is more suitable for a family with children.

The breakfast buffet opens at 6:30, and it seems to be open until 10:30. It has a full range of items, including Chinese and Western styles. It is really pleasant to sit by the lake and have breakfast!

The swimming pool is divided into deep pool and shallow pool. The deep one is 1.2m. You need to wear swimming goggles and swimming cap. The shallower one is only 0.5m. It is suitable for those who can‚Äôt swim to take photos. The water temperature is a bit cold, so you can buy a sun protection jacket when you go there.

It was said that check-out was at 12 o'clock, but we went downstairs at 12:30 and didn't say much. We were also given parking tickets and souvenirs.

There are also some small disadvantages. First, the second bedroom of this room type has no window and bathroom. Second, the air conditioner in the master bedroom is a bit difficult to adapt to when it blows on and off. Third, the privacy of the balcony is not very good, and all rooms can see each other. But these are not big problems, overall it is worth it!

Due to the late start, the Sheraton was full of rooms, and then compared among Hilton, InterContinental, and Kaiyuan for a long time. When I saw the landscape suite of Qiandao Lake Greentown Resort Hotel, with a layout of two bedrooms, two living rooms and two bathrooms, I placed an order without hesitation.
On the way to the hotel, I received a call from Ms. Zhu at the front desk, who thoughtfully upgraded us to a lake view room in Building 1.
I was a little uneasy before checking in because I had seen some negative reviews before. But after entering the room, all anxiety disappeared.
The air-conditioning in the guest room is pre-opened, making it comfortable and cool to enter the room. The room is well-furnished, clean and tidy, without any peculiar smell. There is a feeling of coming home. All beauties, big and small, are very satisfied.
At breakfast time the next day, I forgot to take the room card. The welcoming lady at Yuehu Cafe was very patient. Simply ask and confirm to complete the registration. Made us enjoy a pleasant breakfast time.
Overall, the experience was very good. Except for the long distance and a little tiring driving, the rest is perfect.

After opening the door, the lake view was overwhelmed. Now you don‚Äôt have to go to Tianyu to lie down and watch the sunset. After staying for 2 nights, the scenery is so different every day.

The hotel is located in a park, and there are several buildings in the park, not just the one in Greentown. Suitable for self-driving travel, each building has an underground parking lot, and the parking lot of Greentown is connected at B1, but not at B2. It is very convenient to eat in Building 3.

Watching the sunset, I didn‚Äôt want to go out, so I ordered coffee and takeaway, and the takeout was delivered in half an hour. There is a takeaway box outside the lobby on the first floor, so I went downstairs to pick up the takeaway.

The hotel has an outdoor swimming pool. It is in Building 1. You need to take the hotel's shuttle bus. It is very convenient to be there on call. It takes only a few minutes to get to Building 1. The swimming pool is open from 8 am to 9 pm, and it is not open on rainy days. It is very comfortable to go for a night swim after dinner at night.

The breakfast is on the 2nd floor. The restaurant is not big, and it will be crowded when there are many people, but the taste is okay, and there are all the varieties you should have. Eat special rice balls üçô that are not available in other places.

The decoration of the hotel is not very luxurious, not 5-star standard, but the lake view overcomes everything. The room is also big and clean.

When you check in, you will get a gift for the parent-child room and a coffee gift box for the lake view room!

üåªRoom facilities:
I choose the Deluxe Lake View Suite, with two bedrooms and two bathrooms, without disturbing each other and highly practical. The two bedrooms are large in size, and the bathroom in the master bedroom has a bidet. The living room is connected to the dining room, and there is also a kitchen. The large-capacity refrigerator is really useful in summer. The super large balcony spans the two bedrooms and one living room. The hotel has placed clothes racks and clothes poles here, which is really considerate. I booked a suite in Building 5, and the hotel arranged for me to live in Room 02 on the 15th floor, with a good view and facing the lake. If you need a better view, you can choose to live in Building 1. There is a power card in the room, and you need to swipe the room card when taking the elevator.

üåª Breakfast:
The hotel has 3 buildings and each building has restaurants. Check-in guests can choose their favorite restaurant to dine with their room card. The restaurant in Building 5 has a larger area. The restaurant in Building 1 is near the lake. If you stay for a few more days, it is recommended to come to the lakeside restaurant once. Guests can sit at the bar by the lake and dine under the sun umbrella in the open air. Fans are installed on the handle. The temperature is high these days, and guests can stay indoors. The side of the restaurant facing the lake is all glass, and the view is also very good.

üåªServices:
Sadian's service is very thoughtful and thinks what customers think. Indoor and outdoor, there are all land and water sports, and guests can enjoy themselves. The hotel also has tourism services. It uses a yacht with a capacity of 40 people to take guests to Meifeng Island and Longshan Island, accompanied by a tour guide, and the whole journey takes 4 hours. Just board the boat at the pier in the hotel, and travel is easier. The cleaning of the rooms is timely, and the replenishment and replacement of items are very careful. Yan Hongying, the waiter in the room depar**ent, also sent a souvenir, which moved me very much!

msg:My satisfaction is for the top-floor swimming pool, which is relatively private and has a good view.
        The room is very damp and mildewy, and the air conditioner on the top floor can't get the bottom of it. It basically maintains a body temperature of 26 or 27 degrees, but the air conditioner in the room is terribly cold, no matter how you adjust it, it is still very cold. There is a problem with the orientation of the room. There is no sunlight in the hall, and some sunlight will come in in the room in the afternoon. The stairs to the swimming pool rotate at 360 degrees to go upstairs. There are 30 steps in total. This design is very dizzy.
       The service is not bad, and the cleaning aunts are very accommodating.
       You can eat breakfast, but sometimes you have to wait for a seat when there are too many people. You have to find a way to find a seat by yourself. There is no service staff to arrange waiting and seating.

After washing the clothes at night, they can be dried directly, just like at home, and you can swim downstairs in the hotel. Not to mention the sanitation work, the aunts cleaned it very well, especially Aunt Xu Yuanlan, who was serious and responsible, the ground was very clean, and asked us if there was enough mineral water. Yu Xin from the housekeeping depar**ent also came to visit us, sincere and careful She asked us what opinions and suggestions we had on the housing.

There are 2 swimming pools in the hotel. Children can go to the children's pool. It seems to be only 50 centimeters, which is very short. The adult swimming pool is 1.2 meters deep. It may be a bit cold because of the cloudy day.
The hotel has a children's playground that is open from 10 to 20 o'clock. It is good to bring children to the hotel. There are many kinds of breakfast, and you can enjoy it by the lake, but there are a little too many people, probably because it is a breakfast room shared by several hotels.

Let me talk about the advantages: 1. The room type is very good, suitable for a family of three and three adults. There are two bedrooms and a large balcony. It is cost-effective. Other hotels rarely have this type of room. 2 The balcony has a nice view. I like to stay on the balcony every morning and night.

Every day after breakfast, I walk downstairs along the lake in the hotel, which is very comfortable. 4 The hotel is considered to be in the central area, and the surrounding area is relatively lively.

Different room types have their own advantages and disadvantages: the parent-child suite has one bedroom, one living room and one bathroom, two 1.8-meter-large beds, one of which is in the living room, and some small tents and wooden horses for children to play with; the lake-view deluxe suite has two bedrooms and one living room Two bathrooms and one kitchen (the kitchen cannot be turned on), the master bedroom has an independent bathroom, and the second bedroom has a 1.5-meter small bed. The two-bedroom suite has two bedrooms, two living rooms, two bathrooms and one kitchen (the kitchen cannot be turned on). It has two queen-size beds, a 2m king-size bed in the master bedroom and a 1.8-meter queen-size bed in the second bedroom. The price is several hundred more expensive than a luxury suite.
      When you come to Qiandao Lake, I suggest that you must live in a lake view room. Try to choose a room with a high floor. The view and experience will be much better! In addition, the hotel will launch pre-sale packages for certain room types, which can be a little cheaper than individual bookings.
       There is a "foggy forest" when you turn right at the No. 3 building of the hotel. The greenery is good. You can stroll around the hotel without going out. There is a greenway by the lake when you go out. You can ride and kayak. Overall satisfaction with this stay.
       Disadvantages: The choice of buffet breakfast is still a little less, and the bed is still a bit soft for the elderly; also note that there is no garage under Building 5, and there are few parking spaces on the ground, so you need to park at Building 3 or 2 downstairs.

Later, I found out that it was actually quite good. You can see the sunset. Although I missed it, my parents saw it. As long as it is at night, half of the lights and half of the landscape are still very pleasant. If it is right, I wonder if it will be completely black? After all, the lights on Moonlight Island were turned off around ten o'clock in the evening, and the lake was completely dark. Aunt Zheng, the cleaner, is very nice~ she told us that the locals all go to the winter melon and black vegetable market to buy special products, which are really much cheaper than the specialty shops by the lake. The market can be loosened, sealed, and mailed ~ In fact, to sum up, if you take the elderly on this trip, it is really good to do activities in the hotel area. The various green plants in the foggy forest downstairs are very beautiful, and the pools are matched with various colors. It's beautiful, it's very comfortable to rent bicycles around, and rent a yacht if there are more people.

msg:Greentown can be regarded as an old-fashioned resort hotel developed and built in the early days of Qiandao Lake.
Facilities: A 20-year-old hotel, the decoration is definitely not as good as the current Internet celebrity style, and it is definitely old. But the facilities are the same, the rooms are large, and the suites have many specifications, suitable for several families. Such as the parent-child suite where I live with the elderly and children. Large balcony, wet and dry toilets, etc.
Hygiene: We checked in on the wrong peak on the seventh day of the seventh day, and we did not encounter unclean room furnishings. When it comes to the waiters who make up meals in restaurants, they should pay attention to hygiene, take bread and aprons for a while.
Environment: The environment is very goodüëç The main supporting facilities are complete, which meet the standards of resort hotels. The road along the lake is well repaired. Personally, I think it is better to stay in the hotel and sit on the balcony instead of going on a cruise in the central lake (no ornamental and entertainment, waste of time) Look at the scenery and go downstairs to play by the lake.
Service: I want to make complaints about this. I understand that there is a large number of passengers during the Spring Festival. However, with such a large structure, Greentown should consider the carrying capacity and operating load. Instead of the funny scene of sharing tables, queuing up, and impromptu private rooms for breakfast, it is wronged for passengers to deal with their own employees.
We stayed in Greentown for two nights, a family of four had dinner, and we were arranged to share a table with other passengers. As a result, there was one less seat on a big round table, which meant that a family had breakfast and was separated and shared a table with two other families, creating a mess. ‚Ä¶The waiters have tried their best. There are many tourists and the place is small. Is there any loophole in the management of Greentown? The passengers are almost all booked online. If you don‚Äôt have the carrying capacity, don‚Äôt accept so many passengers. This morning, our family of six and we were also queuing up for breakfast in the lobby. The host said in a northern accent: "It's ridiculous, I'm staying in a hotel and I have to queue for breakfast." I guess he just moved in, because we experienced the funny scene of temporary private rooms, shared tables, and customers eating in the lobby wearing cotton jackets against the draft.
Finally, I contacted Ctrip customer service, and the platform responded positively, at least with the attitude and ability to solve the problem. So since 2017, I have always booked air tickets and hotels on Ctrip, whether domestic or overseas, in Japan, Spain, Portugal, and Australia, which makes people feel at ease and trustworthy.

msg:Very dissatisfied. On the way back, the local drivers in Qiandao Lake said that many Internet celebrity restaurants and hotels spend millions of dollars every year.
Seriously suspect that Greentown is. The most regrettable thing about this trip is to choose to stay in Greentown for two nights.

In terms of the most basic accommodation in the hotel, the 1.8 bed in the suite in Building 1 is less than 1.8. Because the 1.8 bed in our own home is not crowded for us two adults and a four-year-old baby, and it is completely crowded here at night. It is not as comfortable as sleeping in my Suzhou Inn a few weeks ago. And it is said that there are two bathrooms, but they cannot be washed together, the water will be very small, in fact, even if only one is used, the water pressure will not be strong enough. For the same price, please be sure to have two lake-view rooms. The suite is a pit, or it is their free upgrade to get good reviews.

Then let's talk about the included breakfast, with the current operating capacity of Greentown, it is simply not possible to receive so many guests in the room. I never thought that the breakfast in Ctrip's luxury hotel would have to be grabbed. Really, with so many guests and such small plates of food, you can imagine that some plates are never empty. If you want to eat your favorite food, you must guard the waiter and be fast. This is not a vacation, this is a vegetable market.

As for the service, except for check-in, the waiter said a few words, and there was no other time. Response to requests was also extremely slow. As for other additional services such as staying in fruits, butlers, snacks, and gift activities, don't even think about it.

In short, for the same price, I would rather live in the garden view room of the Sheraton. It is really ruined to live in this hotel.

msg:Posted the hotel that was asked about in the circle of friends
I have recommended Greentown to many friends, it is really suitable for vacation‚õ± especially with babies! Ô∏èThe most important thing is that the price is really good!
‚ô•Ô∏èThis time, due to traveling with the baby, I chose to travel by motor car because I was afraid that the baby would not be able to sit still after a 4-hour drive. Shanghai-Qiandao Lake Station takes less than 2 hours. It is very convenient to do a nucleic acid when you land, and the speed of scanning the code to fill in the information is also very fast. It's just that the place for the online car-hailing is a little far from the exit, but the car arrives very quickly. It takes 20-30 minutes from Qiandao Lake Station to Greentown Resort Hotel.
üíöGreentown is divided into Building 1, Building 2 (the same building as Sheraton), Building 3 and Building 5. Buildings 1 and 3 are located near the lake and belong to the first-line lake view. We chose Building 5, which has two bedrooms and one living room. The luxurious lake view suite is 170 square meters, and the average price of a 2-night activity group is in the early 600s per night! Although Building 5 is a little behind! The point is! The balcony is huge! It's like a dream station! Children can run on the balcony ü•≥ It's really nice to have supper on the balcony at night.
The master bedroom also has its own bathroom with a bathtub, which is great, and both the master and the second bedroom can see the lake view. It belongs to the type that does not want to go out in the room.
üíôYou can take the shuttle bus between each building, but I think walking is super fast. We all take our baby to the children's playground in Building 1 (the entertainment facilities including hotel nucleic acid are in Building 1), because When I went there, the weather was a bit cold and it was not suitable for playing in the water. Otherwise, the children's paddling pool is also a good choice for walking the baby.
üíóThere are some water sports in the resort area. If you just want to visit the lake, you can also ride.
üß°Although I live in Building 5, you can go to Building 1 for breakfast, because Building 1 has a row of breakfast seats by the lake, which is great for viewing the scenery or taking pictures üì∑
üíú You can eat fish head near the hotel, why not eat fish head when you come to Qiandao Lake! Fish head soup with chopped pepper and fish head tastes great! And the quantity is huge and the price is super affordable!
üíõFinally, let‚Äôs talk about the front desk, which is responsive. Although there are not many smiles, the attitude is very good. The room service is also very clean, and the room is very clean.

The balcony lake view is only a corner, not wide enough to be considered a real lake view room. The restaurant service needs to be improved. It took more than ten minutes to wait in line for a meal, and the variety was average. Outside Yuehu Lake, there is a bar along the lake, where you can enjoy the lake view while dining.

That is, it may be because there are many people in the summer vacation and the hygiene is worrying. I went there. I saw a melon seed peel on the table, and a plastic ring to check the tag~ There are two hairs in the bathtub~~ But the scenery around the hotel is really good~~

msg:After reading many reviews, I finally chose to stay at Qiandao Lake Greentown Hotel
Location: If you want to play in the swimming pool, you must choose Building 1Ô∏è‚É£, because Building 3Ô∏è‚É£ and Building 5Ô∏è‚É£ are a bit far away, so you need to call a shuttle bus at the front desk!
Because we booked a three-bedroom suite with a 270-degree lake view in Building 3, it is suitable for two people, with two 1.8-sized beds and a 1.35-sized bed, which is a bit crowded for two people. Three families can also stay.
Breakfast: The breakfast floor is not big, the air conditioner can't be turned on, and it's a bit hot. The food is ok, there are not as many varieties as five-star hotels, but it is satisfactory! The attitude of the staff is very good!
Service: As for service, the girl at the front desk is more than a cow, and she doesn't speak softly, which is not the attitude that a five-star hotel should have. But then I met a girl with a good attitude and made up for it!
The auntie who cleans is super nice, the service is in place, like üëç
The water in the pool is super cold, the temperature is already 40 degrees, but the pool can't go down at first, it's too cold!
And there is a very smelly smell around the swimming pool, the depth is 1.2 meters, and I dared to try to swim in it later! If you just want to go swimming with your children, you can choose a hotel with indoor constant temperature!
The quilt in the hotel is a bit trendy. It is recommended that you take it out and dry it. It is very comfortable. I brought my own bed sheet and it was much better in the past!

msg:Going to Qiandao Lake for a pure vacation, not going to the island or swimming in the lake, just walk and swim in the hotel, drive a tour bus, look at the lake in the room, enjoy the sunset, and enjoy the slow pace of Qiandao Lake. Greentown Resort Hotel is very suitable. The deluxe lake view suite in Building 1 is quite large, with a large living room facing the lake, two bedrooms and two bathrooms, kitchen and storage room, and a large balcony. But the decoration and facilities are a bit old, and the room was a little damp when I entered the room. There are many varieties of breakfast, and the small wontons in the Ming file are delicious. But there are so many people that it is not easy to find a seat. Outside the breakfast room, there is a long trail along the lake. Along the way, there are cruise boats, water sports ticket offices, and leisure bicycle rental offices. At the end, there is a piano by the lake and decorations similar to "skyland". In the evening, there are many Take wedding photos for the newlyweds. In short, the flaws do not hide the truth. I still like the Greentown vacation very much. It is recommended for family vacations with high cost performance.
ps. Nucleic acid can be done in the hotel, which is very convenient.

msg:This summer, the premiums of major hotels are huge. For those who go to Qiandao Lake for vacation every year, Greentown Resort Hotel is indeed a highly cost-effective priority hotel. The price is reasonable, the room is large, the balcony is very large, the scenery is very beautiful, and you can enjoy the scenery of Qiandao Lake without going out. As for the building number, I still like Building No. 1. Although Building No. 3 has the best scenery, Building No. 1 is not bad. In particular, it is much more convenient to go down to the first floor where there are children who want to play in the swimming pool. The disadvantage is that there are only two elevators and they are not big, which is a bit slow in the peak season. For breakfast, it is recommended to go around 7:00 in the morning. The environment is good with less people eating. There may be a queue between 8:00 and 9:30 to get in. In general, it's still good. Next time you come to Qiandao Lake, you will still prefer Greentown Resort Hotel.

There is no children's toothbrush, I brought my own, and I don't bother to ask for it. Shampoo and shower gel are all gone.

Hotel waiters Hong Mary and Chen Manying provided attentive service and presented afternoon tea and fruits.

The front desk received Xiaoye's warm service and upgraded us to the little yellow duck parent-child room on the 15th floor. The room was spacious, clean and tidy. The two balconies had a good view and the lake view was beautiful. , I like to sit on the balcony in a quiet daze, and my family is very satisfied. I think I will stay in Greentown next time I come to Qiandao Lake for vacation.

The software service is also excellent. Everyone from the front desk to the room attendant and restaurant waiter is very friendly and warm. The front desk clerk in Building 3 arranged for us the floor with the best view, thank you very much. Miss Ni at the front desk of Building 1 presented Starbucks coffee, which was very considerate. In short, a very nice travel experience, I hope Greentown will continue to maintain, we will come again. . .

msg:As soon as I came back from the lake tour in Qiandao Lake, the ink landscape paintings hanging by the window came into view, overlooking the lake scenery under the setting sun, I couldn‚Äôt help but wonder what the view from the balcony of the lake-view room in Building 3 would look like? It&#39;s a pity that the first two nights arrived late one day and one day of light rain. Since the renewal price of the lake view room in Greentown Building 3 was doubled on Saturday, and I was going to Xiaoshan Airport to take a plane at noon on Sunday, I wondered whether it would be more comfortable to go back to Hangzhou and see the parent-child suite in Building 5. And the standard room has a good price, so I decided to continue to live in the bright and spacious Greentown. I met Miss Hong Xuezhen who happened to be on duty at the front desk of Building No. 3 during the room adjus**ent. I had the opportunity to thank her face to face for her assistance in arranging the room, giving instructions on the itinerary, reminding the time and place of the cruise, etc. The courtesy car assisted a family and a bunch of luggage to arrive. The room in Building 5 continues to exceed expectations! I liked the dining environment of Building 1 near the lakeside restaurant when I took my children on a bicycle on the lakeside in the evening. Unfortunately, I had to leave early in the morning and didn&#39;t have time to have breakfast. I hope that I will make up for this small regret when I have the opportunity to live in Greentown next time!

msg:In June, I am too tired and want to go out for a vacation. I chose Qiandao Lake Greentown for vacation. There are four hotels in the entire resort area, Greentown Sheraton, Greentown Vacation, Greentown Blue Bay, and Peninsula Time. Buildings 1 and 3 are Greentown Resort, and in the middle is Greentown Sheraton, which has its own independent outdoor swimming pool and various facilities. Compared with Building 1, Building 3 faces the Central Lake District more directly. Sitting on the balcony and drinking tea, chatting, and drinking are all good choices. The room is quite big, but the internal facilities are relatively old, but they are well maintained.

After all, it was renovated 12 years ago, I was afraid that it was too broken and it turned out to be seriously misleading! Hope it can be verified! The hotel is located in the center of the city, which is very convenient. There are three hotels in a hotel-style apar**ent complex in Greentown. I chose building 3 of the resort hotel. Room one living room one bathroom two balcony, there is also a big bed in the hall), after opening the door, it is indeed consistent with the video introduced by Ctrip Hotel, not so old, it makes me nervous, and bad reviews for people who have bad reviews! Overall, the room is ok, worthy of the price, the mattress and sofa are a little old, the bedding and bathroom supplies and towels are okay, and the toiletries need to be asked at the front desk according to local policies. The room has an invincible lake view. It is very open and basically unobstructed. It is also very comfortable to sit on the balcony. This is what I want üòÜüòÜ, because it is a parent-child room, there are slides and small tents, cute little things for children, There are even children&#39;s slippers embroidered with little yellow ducks. The overall price/performance ratio is ok, and I will stay in the future. I won&#39;t be nervous any more. I am afraid that there will be an example in the bad review. It is too old and there are bugs and molds. Misleading!

Every time I go out and come back, the guy at the front of the hotel sees it from afar and helps to open the door and lift the wheelchair, giving the guy at the front of the hotel five stars.
Let's talk about the hotel breakfast. Although the breakfast is not as rich as the InterContinental and Sheraton's, it is also very good for our families with moderate economic conditions. After all, the hotel price is there, and our family is still very satisfied.
This time we booked a deluxe suite in Building 1. The master bedroom is great, with a bathtub, the bathroom has an automatic flushing toilet cover, and the second bedroom has a glass door that cannot be opened because it cannot be opened, so it cannot be ventilated. One thousand five or six nights is still a good deal.
ps: 1. The hotel belongs to the combination of high-end apar**ents and four-star hotels, not five-star hotels. If you like Kaiyuan and Intercontinental hotels with a lot of greenery and children's amusement facilities, don't choose this place.
2. There is a small reunion stove fish in the community. It is very good. The fish is very fresh and very tender. I went to the old club on the first day, and the four big one ate 600 yuan. On the third day, I went to the small reunion, the four big one. Snack for two hundred and four, good quality and low price, recommended

msg:Before the Spring Festival in 2022, I booked the Greentown Resort Hotel. I didn't expect the epidemic to come, and Hangzhou became more and more serious. So, in the mood to give it a try, I called the front desk. Ms. Yang from the front office kindly sent the hotel's QR code to let us scan the code before coming to pay attention to the changes in the epidemic situation and pay attention to the results of the scan code. During the period If you have any questions, please contact her at any time and get a satisfactory answer.

On the third day of our stay, everything was normal when we went out to Yintai City. When we returned to the hotel, the entrance code turned orange. Only then did we realize that it was because we passed Xiaoshan Airport and Hangzhou East Railway Station when we arrived, and the hotel staff took the initiative to take us to the nearby one. The community is informed. The staff in the community also made me feel the care and responsibility of the Hangzhou people. The orange code turned green in less than an hour after contacting the flow control center.

During the seven-day stay in the hotel, including the New Year's Eve and the first day of the new year, the service staff on the entire floor remembered that one surnamed Huang and one surnamed Kong provided excellent service. Due to various inconveniences during the Spring Festival, we often asked to change bath towels and send plugs Line boards, delivery of utensils and many other odds and ends, they can complete it very well, and every time we can clean the room very clean in a very short time when we eat breakfast. The housekeeping center is also responsive, especially the tiger dolls on the first day of the new year, which are very warm.

In short, this trip, especially in special times, has a good sense of the service level of Qiandao Lake in Hangzhou, which is standardized and warm, perfect and efficient. I look forward to the next trip to Qiandao Lake.

üçÉEnvironment: The location of the hotel is very good. It is very convenient for eating and shopping nearby. The 270-degree lake-view suite has been ordered this time. The scenery is pleasant. The two large-bed rooms have floor-to-ceiling windows and face the lake view directly.
üîîService: Generally, the high-level I noted is also arranged on the middle floor. There is no smile service at the front desk when checking in. The price is five stars, and the standard is four stars. The room facilities are a bit dated, the breakfast variety is average and there is no special feature.
Tucao: Don‚Äôt tell the security guard at the hotel‚Äôs entrance that you‚Äôre going to cruise or not. The taxi enthusiastically called for you will take you to their good pier... It‚Äôs far and bad. Didi taxi is reliable.

My friend recommended me the Greentown Hotel. I moved in with the idea of giving it a try. At that time, I wanted to change the hotel if it didn't work. I really didn't expect that the surrounding environment of the hotel is so good, the rooms can have a lake view, and the price is very beautiful, I like it all at once! Great! Although the bedding facilities are not as good as those in Sheraton hotels, the overall feeling is good.

msg:Old customers of Ctrip, who have stayed in so many hotels, generally do not write reviews or give negative reviews. This house can't stand it anymore. The hotel‚Äôs parking management is chaotic, and the decoration is outdated. The most unacceptable thing is that there are poisonous insects in the room. You can check the damage of the paederus. More than one was found. Finally, the last night was recruited. My wife was bitten on the face because she rushed back to Shanghai the next morning. At that time, she negotiated with the manager to observe the situation and contact them at any time if she seeks medical attention. After coming back, the wound was serious, and the doctor concluded that it was paederus dermatitis, and I continued to take the medicine until today after a follow-up visit after taking the medicine. Contact the hotel manager Li, the way to deal with it is to let me send them the medical documents to go through the process, only to compensate for the medical expenses, not even the lost work. The whole process was indifferent and I could ignore it. I said that I could not accept this compensation plan and would not reply to my message again. Am I missing you the medical expenses? ? ? As a five-star hotel, as a Greentown management famous for its service, is Song Weiping giving you the courage? As a member of the Greentown system, I often report projects to Mr. Song. Would you like to ask Mr. Song next time if you do this, does he know? The attached picture illustrates the whole situation. If you book to avoid the pit, you can avoid the pit.

Before we left, we ordered a bus to go to the high-speed rail station. Brother Fang Jin from the concierge depar**ent was also very warm and friendly. He not only took us to the bus station but also helped put our luggage on the bus. Thank you again;

msg:I just want to ask if this score is brushed out? I first booked the No. 5 lake view parent-child suite. I went up to see it. Is this lake view? There is a big road ahead, and the lake view is far away. Go down and discuss the room change with the front desk, they are also refreshed, indeed the lake view is not very good, then you are ashamed to say that you are a lake view room? Finally posted the money to the third building. Building 3 1209, the door is broken, it takes a lot of effort to open and close the door, if you don't pay attention, the alarm will sound, and the aunt in the guest room also said it was loose. The bathtub was broken, it was loose and fell down, and I couldn't put the water down at all. The hardware is a mess, what about your software? The front desk said that there was no smile at all, and was extremely impatient. The telephone service desk, it can be said that this is the hardest voice I have ever heard. In the restaurant, the waiter adds tissues to each table and just throws them away without asking. ! The only compliment is the housekeeping aunt, who was very enthusiastic and took the initiative to put two more bottles of water for us. If it's not that the room rate cannot be refunded the next day, we must change to another hotel! There are two reasons for staying in Greentown. One is that I lived there once eight or nine years ago, and I think it is really good, and the other is that the score on Ctrip is pretty good! Now I can only haha! The hardware is not maintained, and the software is not trained! Does it all depend on brushing! I have stayed in countless hotels, and this experience is a nigh**are!

msg:On the day of check-in, the service housekeeper Hong Xuezhen was appointed to be in charge of the reception. He provided local play and food guides and was very useful. The hotel‚Äôs location in the central lake area is really great. There is a lake view in front and a street behind. It is very convenient for dining, travel, and shopping. Ctrip booked a three-day parent-child view room in Building 1, but I think the lake view is not as good as expected. Steward Hong actively helped me adjust the room. Due to the peak season, I can only upgrade to the deluxe lake view room the next day. It‚Äôs also worthwhile to be able to face the lake view of Qiandao Lake. Just as Manager Hong‚Äôs guide said, the best way to come to Qiandao Lake is to lie down in a luxurious lake view room and look at the lake view to relax. There is a swimming pool in the hotel. The gym and children's amu*****t facilities will definitely not be boring to take your children. Children are tired of playing early and falling asleep.
It took a day to take a yacht to the island and cruise the lake. Meifeng Island is a bit worth seeing. However, the food on the island is about twice as high as the restaurants near the hotel. It is recommended to walk on the mountain and go down the grass on the island. The child bought a cable car to go up and down. There are 60 adults and 30 children. It takes less than 30 minutes to go to the island to see the scenery. In addition, the moonlight island is composed of four small islands connected in series by a pontoon bridge. There are other islands on the island. The amu*****t items are charged separately. Just remember to let the children feed the fish. Other items did not arouse my interest. After going up Longshan Island, I must take 20 electric cars. Otherwise, there is not enough time for the hike to board the boat, but I don‚Äôt see any walking trails? The last stop of electric vehicles can reach the highest point of the island. It has a thousand-year old clock, but there is an imitation clock for people to hit the clock free of charge. The weather is cool and it feels good to hit the top of the clock. The rest of Yule Island is purely a water amu*****t project. The only thing I found to be thrilling was to be accompanied by a coach. I was not interested in the ones I had ridden. I spent 150 yuan for my seven-year-old daughter to try. The daughter said it was fun. The whole trip to the island took nearly 6 hours. Nothing but still tired.
The next day, I went straight to the "Time Tunnel" of Internet celebrities. The tickets for adults and children seemed to be 98 yuan and 68 yuan. The three scenes took 30 minutes to complete. I felt dazzled and felt like that? The price/performance ratio is really speechless. I wanted to go to the water park, but it was hot at noon, and I finally chose to go back to the hotel to rest and swim. The four-day and three-night trip sounded long but it passed in an instant. The typhoon was fierce on the day of the return trip. I heard that Zhejiang was flooded on the day I returned home. It is estimated that many facilities in Qiandao Lake will be affected.
Another thing to mention is that the phone screen was broken on the first day. Although Mr. Hong was eager to introduce several mobile phone stores, he still had to go back to the place of residence to replace it after considering the follow-up after-sales issues. That is, the photos can only be kept in his mind if they are not left. The cleaning staff is very kind. When I went swimming in the aisle, I saw that the child did not have a bathrobe and offered to give me a compliment! The children in this line are very happy, as for the adults, they have reaped the beautiful scenery!

Hotel swimming pool üà∂ special children‚Äôs swimming pool (in Building 1, you can ask the front desk to call the battery sightseeing car to pick you up), the children are having fun, the interior of the hotel is also quite large, just like there are several buildings in a community, 3 If you take the hotel bus from the train station in Building No., remember to get off at the Blue Bay Hotel. You can take the shortest way. Breakfast is on the second floor. There are quite a lot of tricks. Overall, I am satisfied, because I have not stayed in other hotels and cannot make comparisons. !

I booked the Lakeview Family Suite on Building 5. It shows the room area on Trip.com at 110 square meters. In fact, there are about 50 or 60 square meters in one room and one hall. There is a big bed. A small bed. The water is too much. Does it count the balcony?
There is a small swimming pool in Building 1, no bath towels, no service, rushing people at 9 o'clock on time, people turn off the lights without leaving clean, this is the service of the luxury hotel? Speechless üòí
The front desk did not recognize the face, did not look at the health code, the front desk service attitude was not good when checking in, the feeling of this hotel is completely bad
Finally, say the breakfast, don't hold hopes, there is noodles to eat, even the watermelon is changed to bananas, and the standard of the economic hotel is similar, the service can't keep up with
Such a bad hotel has been booked for two nights, I can't fully believe the evaluation of Trip.com in the future @

There are still many people for breakfast during summer vacation and weekdays. There will be a queue at the door after 9 o'clock. The breakfast variety is not many and the taste is general, but basically what you want to eat is not particularly delicious. Because people are really a lot of staff closed quickly and didn‚Äôt wait for a long time. I went to sit at the big yellow duck at night. The children found it very exciting. Then walk around the psychedelic forest in Building 3 to take pictures. Of course, the hotel also has its shortcomings, such as the room‚Äôs air-conditioning is loud at the front desk Not enthusiastic enough, but I can understand because there are really many people during the holiday. The breakfast is generally net red afternoon tea is in the outdoor breakfast restaurant on the first floor. The seats on the side of the lake are very hot, but during the summer vacation, Qiandao Lake Greentown is really a very cost-effective hotel. Ask a friend to bring your elders to experience it. After all, the scenery is really beautiful

msg:This is the third time I have stayed in Greentown, and I am very familiar with it. Needless to say, the environment inside and outside the hotel is not good. I would not decide this for three times when I come to Qiandao Lake. I originally wanted to choose Intercontinental, but the access is more convenient than Intercontinental, and there is no need to eat. If you need to drive out, take the hotel's scooter directly to the vicinity of Building 4, and it's only a few tens of meters away from the hotel. Breakfast in Building No. 1 is the best. In Yuehu Caf√©, you can have breakfast by the lake if you are not afraid of the heat. But this experience was not very satisfied with the front desk service. They felt that only one girl in a white shirt was very nice at the front desk. No matter how many customers and no matter how busy they are, they would also receive a smile on their faces. We did our best to help customers solve their problems. When I checked in, there were a lot of people and there was no high-level. I told her that I left a message for the high-level when I booked the room. She arranged it for us very well, although I waited for more than half an hour. I feel that apart from her, the other front desk staff, both men and women, are stretched and impatient. They speak very hard. To be honest, we are on vacation. Will seeing such a service attitude affect our mood? The aunts in the customer service are very nice, polite, and smile all over the face. May I ask, no matter how busy you are at the front desk, is the person with room service tired?

On the same day, there was only the parent-child lake view room on the sixth floor. Satisfied, the attitude of the girl at the front desk is very nice, first like it! We booked a lake view parent-child in Building 1, 120 square meters. There is a children‚Äôs room and a bathroom in the door. There is a storage room by the aisle, and then the master bedroom and bathroom. The room is large and the air circulation is good, both are 270 degrees. The window, the light is very bright! Pushing the door out is a super large 270-degree balcony, with rattan chairs, coffee tables, lounge chairs, floor-to-ceiling clothes racks and stainless steel hangers. It is very clean and you can see the lake view of about 60 degrees, and the view is still very wide. Open the door and you can hear the laughter of the children in the swimming pool downstairs. The door was opened slightly and the room was very quiet. After staying for three nights, they all slept well without sound. Because the quilt must be a bit damp by the lake, I put on a disposable quilt, so I can't feel it at all. The rooms have all the necessary settings, there is a lot of space for things, and it is really comfortable. Shao Caifeng, the waiter, was polite, cleaned the room neatly, the room was short of things, and the waiter delivered it quickly. On the third day, he quietly delivered a large plate of fruit! In particular, the shelves for drying clothes on the balcony are truly humane. If it were not for Huang Meitian, it is estimated that the clothes can be dried in the sun in one day. The only thing that feels bad is the noisy level of breakfast in Building No. 1 and there are too many people. The stay is very comfortable, come again next time!

Building No. 3 can go to Building No. 1 for breakfast. On the same day, a staff member of Building No. 3 was encountered in the elevator. He said that he could not go to Building No. 1. But he actually asked the front desk about it. In fact, he was holding No. 3 building. It‚Äôs okay to have your room card to dine in Building 1. Let me talk about the unpleasant check-in that day. When I arrived that afternoon, I just ran into a tour group. It was a summer camp group. There were 3 staff at the front desk. One was running a group and one was running individual tourists. I was ranked second among individual tourists. The first one had been in operation for a long, long time. During the period, a lady wearing glasses at the front desk could not figure out the situation and helped the guests behind me to check in in advance. I asked me to wait for a while and was speechless. Praise Zheng Aiwen, who cleaned the guest room, for helping us change the position of the drying rack, so that we can get more sun.

Special thanks to the waiter, Ms. Zhuge Meilan, who presented us with fruits every day for two days, and our needs were met in time for us! ! ! It was not as indifferent as some comments said, maybe the two ladies we met had a very good service attitude! ! ! The hotel‚Äôs breakfast is available in Building 5 and Building 1. The breakfast in Building 1 is closer to the lake, but in terms of types, I feel that the breakfast in Building 5 is not as good as the breakfast in Building 1. The overall variety is average, not Especially rich! ! The hotel is strategically located close to Xiushui Square, it is more convenient whether to eat or to other places! ! ! Overall, the hotel facilities are not particularly good. The overall feeling of the room is average. The price of a holiday hotel will rise to 1000‚ûï, which is usually around 500. So the overall level of the hotel feels like the price is around 500! The hotel is quite big, you can go around inside, there is a passage along the lake! ! It is good to be able to ride a bicycle or walk! !

For breakfast, there are a lot of people, the variety is average, there is an underground parking lot, which is convenient, there is a Huanhu Road to ride, and the sunset is very beautiful.
