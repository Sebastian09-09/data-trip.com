The only thing I think could be improved is the music in the lobby. It was a bit strange that there were country, jazz and classical music all mixed together. Haha

msg:This is a journey that has special meaning for me and my family. Overall, I think choosing this hotel is the right decision for the Spring Festival holiday.

The road to the mountain was very difficult. I was repeatedly beating my heart in the middle of the way. Finally, I drove to the top of the mountain. My energy was already on the verge of exhaustion, but then I participated in the ridge hiking experience. The beautiful sunset and the stunning scenery reawakened my mood for vacation.

After watching the sunset, the restaurant prepared a mutton pot for dinner. My family and I don’t like this kind of mutton, but the crispy meat is very delicious, and the variety and quantity of vegetables are also suitable for my needs. I am quite satisfied.

After eating and drinking, I returned to the room and planned to wash and clean up and have a good rest, but I was greeted by three tests. First, the toilet flushing system was broken; after taking a shower, I found that the hair dryer socket had poor contact, so I had to move it to a place other than in front of the mirror to operate it; the most annoying thing was that the smart curtains would open and close irregularly, and the jamming sound was irritating and uneasy, which made me collapse directly after driving a day and having a very shallow sleep. I couldn't fall asleep until midnight. Fortunately, my family was not affected by this, and the customer service staff was really patient and apologetic. I didn't want to lower the evaluation for this, but I hope that the management will really pay attention to the maintenance and repair of facilities from the perspective of the guests.

I woke up before dawn the next day. The sunrise in winter is about seven o'clock. The morning light is really gentle. There is a hand-cranked grinder in the room. I made hand-brewed coffee by myself. I played in the room until nine o'clock for breakfast.

I played on the first and second floors of the public area all morning, took pictures, drank tea, and swung on the swings. I left with peace and joy. The good service and beautiful environment of the hotel are a place to create beautiful memories for myself and my beloved family. I hope you will get better and better.

PS: Going down the mountain is much easier than going up the mountain 😅

msg:Pu Yu was highly recommended by my friend, who said it was a private collection. It was really worth the trip. It is not inferior to hotels of the same price abroad. I thought there were no good hotels in Guizhou, but when I arrived at the hotel, I was shocked. The rime, sea of ​​clouds and starry sky were all there, which was extremely shocking (I didn't take pictures of the starry sky). The breakfast and dinner at the hotel were great, especially the mutton soup. I was surprised. The milky white soup was so delicious... There are not many hotels in China with floor heating. It is so comfortable to go indoors barefoot in the winter. The service and products are very down-to-earth. It feels like going home. In a word, it is a great hotel, worthy of being a top wild luxury. I plan to go there again in summer.

msg:I love this kind of sp****ly populated hotel. There are 19 rooms in total. It takes almost an hour to drive on the winding mountain road. You don’t have to look at people’s heads on National Day.
Breakfast and dinner are included. One dinner is fish hotpot in sour soup, a Guizhou specialty, and another Western food. The kids are a lot taller, and there’s no extra charge.
The parent-child room has a large bed of 1.8cm and a small bed of 1.2cm, which is enough for sleeping.
There was also a guessing activity during the Mid-Autumn Festival. If you guessed it, you won the essential oil soap in the lottery.
There are also various other activities, including farm stays, flower and plant painting, tea breaks, and hiking. The 3 days and 2 nights can be fully booked.

If you have any needs, just mention the welcome fruits prepared in the room, as well as hand-brewed coffee, tea, and drinks... The bedroom is facing the large window. Open the electric curtains early in the morning at the place where the sun rises🌄. The beautiful scenery of the rising sun is immediately impressive to your eyes. Of course, this has a little to do with weather luck and so on😆😬 So it is very important to set off with good weather. Finally, I praise this little girl. My brother’s breakfast was prepared very well and tasted right👍👍👍

Too many B&Bs can only be photographed, and the real ones are too "B&B", so my wife decided After a long time of research, I finally chose this one. The score wasn’t the highest, but I’m glad I made the right choice. The hotel is located in an inaccessible mountain. The scenery is first-rate and the air is sweet. We photographed a meteor shower and saw fireflies. The hardware and taste are top-notch. The food and service are also good. There is no over-enthusiasm and the service is relatively quiet. , matching the hotel style. It is a rare taste in China. My only suggestion is that the hotel can provide a daze package discount for regular customers. [baring teeth]

msg:I'm a lazy person and generally don't like to write reviews. This time I made an exception for Pu Yu. Because I love traveling, I have visited many places across the country (for the time being, I have only been to the UK, Singapore, South Africa, and a few islands around the world), and luxury hotels have always been my hobby. In recent years, many wild luxury hotels have emerged. But most of them are just wild but not extravagant. I accidentally saw Pu Yu's introduction one time and came here specifically to visit. I stayed in Guiyang for one night and then went to Dushan. The road up the mountain is indeed winding and takes a long time, but I got off at the top of the mountain. The first sight of the scenery made me feel it was worth it. I personally really don’t want to ride in a helicopter. The entire hotel is very comfortable starting from the welcome drink. The various accessories are designed and the bedding is good. The room has a tea set and coffee grinder, which is suitable for passing time in a boring daze. The floor heating in the bathtub is also very suitable for me. The air is fresh and the view is unparalleled. The food was good, but the portion was a bit too big for one person. The design of the whole room is really interesting. You can see the sunrise while lying on the bed, just like an oil painting hanging in front of the bed, nice! I also gave my suggestions to the hotel. Although non-disposable toiletries are now standard in resort hotels (Banyan Tree Park Hotel and Aman all like to do this, and the Waldorf Astoria in Beijing has also started to follow it... I’m really convinced), but it does Some customers (like me) are struggling with safety and hygiene issues and hope to have a choice. Generally speaking, the price is worthy of the location, facilities, equipment and services of this hotel. The altitude allows people to see the starry sky and sea of ​​clouds and enjoy the coolness without worrying about high altitude sickness (unlike when I was in Niubei Mountain... ) I hope that the details and service can be improved to a higher level. I will come again.

msg:I finally experienced "Plain Language and Wild Luxury", which perfectly interprets the concept of escaping from the world for the minority and enjoying the mountains for the benevolent. This holiday paradise is an oasis of beauty and tranquility, surrounded by lush forests and majestic mountains.
When I first stepped into this place, I was struck by the stunning natural scenery. The hotel building is fully integrated into the surrounding environment, making people feel like they are in the embrace of nature. Each room is designed to be unique and comfortable, with natural elements taking the lead while maintaining an original look as much as possible. In the suite I stayed in, the spacious and bright windows brought me spectacular mountain views and shadows of trees, and every detail was intoxicating.
In addition to exquisite accommodation, the hotel also provides a range of luxurious leisure facilities. I can walk in the pollution-free nature and feel the fresh air and fragrant flowers. You can also take a leisurely bath in nature to relax your body and mind and enjoy yourself. I heard that you can make an appoin**ent for a professional spa therapist to come to your home...
The most surprising thing is that the hotel restaurant is so exquisite. The freshest and best ingredients are selected. Every dish is full of care. While you are feasting on your taste, you can also experience the local culture and food traditions.
In this secluded corner, I really felt the tranquility and relaxation brought by vacation. No matter how short the time is, every time you visit "Puyu", you can stay away from the hustle and bustle and live in harmony with nature. This is a paradise to pursue inner peace and physical and mental pleasure. It does not require much wealth, just keep an open mind and kindness.
In addition to the intoxicating resort environment of "Puyu", I would also like to praise the proprietress of this hotel. She is not only beautiful, but also a woman with connotation and wisdom. She greets every guest with her unique charm and warm smile, making people feel like home.
During the conversation with this lady boss, I deeply felt her intelligence and gentle and delicate way of treating others. Her love for the natural environment and care for her guests reflect her inner beauty. She uses her sincere attitude and professional service to make every guest feel at home.
The beauty of this boss lady is not only external, but also internal. She continuously learns and pursues improvement to provide better services and experiences. She is good at listening to her guests' needs and suggestions and constantly improving and innovating. Her intelligence and connotation complement each other, making people admire her spontaneously.
Such hotel proprietresses not only add unparalleled charm to "Plain Language", but also give us a deeper understanding of the perfect combination of beauty and wisdom. With her presence, she has become one of the most beautiful sights in this hotel and an unforgettable memory for guests. Thank you to this hotel proprietress for bringing us beauty and touch. She is a truly admirable woman.

msg:It is a relatively luxurious B&B on the top of the mountain. The road up the mountain is difficult to drive, so we booked a hotel pick-up. The hotel has a helicopter transfer, but we didn’t choose it this time due to the weather.

The scenery is unparalleled and the hotel facilities are unparalleled. We communicated in advance and took the initiative to upgrade us to a family suite. (It was sold out when we made the reservation.) There are free-flow drinks in the room, and a fruit basket. The tea and coffee are both delicious. Better. Various small activities in the hotel are very interesting, such as flower and plant painting, specimen making, etc., and there are also free travel photos.

The hotel's breakfast is rich in variety and the afternoon tea is exquisite. Dinner is also good, but the Western food is slightly inferior because the ingredients on the top of the mountain are difficult to find and there are slightly fewer choices. It is very considerate to provide small refreshments in the room in the evening.

On the day of arrival, there was thunder and the power grid was damaged. As a result, there was no electricity in the room until night. It was a wild and wild place, so I asked the customer service for some candle lights to add to the a**osphere.

Areas that can be slightly improved: Because the road up the mountain is difficult and quite far. I was very hungry when I arrived at the hotel and wanted to eat something, but the hotel didn't offer it (afternoon tea had to be booked a day in advance, and it wasn't available on the day). It was a bit disappointing that the restaurant didn't even offer bun sandwiches. I hope you can add some bread sandwiches to the welcome refreshments. I can’t get enough of the cookies, haha. In addition, the Wi-Fi signal in the room is slightly weak.

I have stayed in similar mountaintop hotels abroad, and experienced similar thunderstorms, arriving in the middle of the night, etc., but I have not encountered any trouble. I guess there is always room for improvement.

Hope it gets better and better.

配套設施不行。1. 酒店裡沒有洗手液 2.沐浴液洗髮液感覺不是一次性用品，用瓦罐裝的，有點分量，用手進去把挖出來，或者倒出來，如果不是一次性用品，不同客人如果反覆進去用手挖，豈不是很不衞生。 3.床上鋪的棕色的腳墊，一翻面，很多渣渣 碎屑掉下來。感覺有點臟

至於奢. 酒店房間的朝向, 佈局, 和傢俱用品的選擇都看得出非常用心. 無論是在露台上小睡, 還是打開玻璃門看着山景泡澡,都會覺得很自然適宜. 傍晚的餐廳窗外雲霧繚繞, 室內燈光昏黃温馨, 恍惚中是在大都市豪華的酒店裡. 晚餐的色香味, 服務生的手勢也都配得上這樣的餐廳. 除了硬件外, 工作人員的服務也是到位. 每天的房間清理總是在不知不覺中完成. 早餐回來, 床鋪和衞生間都已經收拾好. 下午回來, 小點心已經放在桌上. 管家的微信基本秒回. 見面也都是熱情招呼. 總之, 希望樸語能順順利利,來年再來野奢幾天.

酒店會組織工作人員帶領大家去看日落

泡在浴缸裏就能看雲海
早餐一定要喝一碗牛肉粉
晚餐有點泰餐的風格，味道很贊
吃的好，住的好，景色好，服務號
所以抵達酒店的山路是唯一的挑戰，下次考慮預訂直升機上山

酒店近山頂，滿眼美景。崖浴24小時温水，可隨時享受山間的温泉。

房間裝修不落俗套，很符合酒店的定位，傢俱擺件非常考究，細節處體現了經營者的用心。

酒店的服務更是不必説，管家們體貼入微，大廚的中西餐都做得很棒。

唯獨有一點不足，崖浴私密性欠佳，在白天出入池時需注意周圍往來的人。入住時餐廳外正在施工，崖浴時碰到了工人在高處以及出池時遇到去低處房間打掃的管家，也是有些尷尬😅。
晚上就沒關係啦！

很期待下次的入住！

房費不包含午餐的，但是早上吃的很飽，完全不用吃午餐，直接吃晚餐剛剛好。
來之前管家就已經提前告知晚餐每天都是不一樣的，好像有歐式、東南亞菜系、本地特色菜、中式炒菜等，今天我們吃的則是西餐，説實話，這麼偏的地方，還能點各種甜品西餐，有點驚訝到我了，口感不比專業的西餐差，據説酒店的廚師是五星級大廚，難怪各種口感審美都在線。

酒店真的建在一片無人區的山頂上。山下有很古老破舊的村寨，環境和生態都很好。
出發比較晚，管家和前台都貼心，怕我們迷路，一路保持聯絡。到了酒店電瓶車司機早早等待在停車場，幫我們搬行李，送我們到大廳。
實在是餓了，管家建議我們先用餐，然後安排行李員直接把我們的行李送到房間了。酒店整個給人的感覺有一種很洋氣又古樸，很高級但又很熱情樸實的感覺，氛圍感十足。
視頻裏的懸崖泡池外是好美的雲海，好幸運我們來的時候看到了雲海，更美妙的是，看到了雪景！！
本來擔心下着雪户外的泡池會冷，但泡池是24小時恆温的，水温很合適，隨時都可以跳下去泡一泡。望出去一片雪白的世界，不像人間的景色，拍照不要太美。和閨蜜在這裏拍了絕美大片，回去朋友們都驚呼這是什麼神仙地方！！！哈哈哈，聽説每個季節看到的景色都不一樣，約好春暖花開的時候再來一次。

客房很大，分為三個區域，有很舒服的茶室，睡房和洗浴室，每-一個空間都有超級大的落地窗!所以無論是喝茶，睡覺，還是泡澡洗漱，拉開窗簾每一- 個角落都可以看到很美的山景。配的紅茶和咖啡豆晶質都相當不錯，喝完了問管家能不能再送一-些來， 也是很快送過來了。冰箱裏配的飲料也蠻高級的，房間很乾凈，入住的時候差不多零度，在房間裏就很温暖很舒服。遺憾的沒有訂到泡池房，這個天要泡個温泉才舒服。前台説有個即將建成的冥想空間會有spa和温泉，等修好了再來一一次。
