msg:Positives: 
The staff tries hard.
Negatives: 
The spa was closed. 
The 2nd floor bar has been closed for a year but advertising for it is still all over the hotel. 
Other than the buffet (which was too busy due to it being spring festival) the only other dining options were the lobby bar or room service. 
The lobby bar closes at 8pm and there's nothing else within a walkable distance to make up for the lack of options in the hotel. 
Room service food was edible but not worth it.You have to go downstairs to receive food deliveries. 
The kettle plug didn't fit the outlet. 
The bathroom was a little dirty. 
My breakfast card wasn't picked up overnight. They made up for this by comping my breakfast. Again, edible.

All in all I think the hotel has been hit hard by covid and they're not able to keep the standards you'd expect. I'd have been better off at a self service apartment. At least then deliveries would arrive to my door.

I ordered some takeaway and the “delivery robot” are really slow, it tools hours from the reception desk to be delivered to my room, overall grading, this was the worst Sheraton that I have ever stayed.

And although the surrounding of the hotel is in some kind of a trading zone, and you can't avoid passing by big storage areas when walking, you wouldn't feel it when going by car.
Our room was spacious and clean, and breakfast buffet was very good! People working in all areas of the hotel are warm and friendly, and there was always someone in the lobby who could speak English.
Right beside the hotel, there is a nice spa for those who want to relax.
I am quite satisfied with the hotel and I believe I will stay here every time I need to commute between Shenzhen and Hong Kong in future!

Put down your luggage before setting off, the service is attentive and very good! The hotel also has a free shuttle bus to take guests to checkpoints and attractions, which is very good!

The breakfast is very good, but it was eaten in a hurry because I got up late.
The facilities are a bit old, but they can meet basic needs.

The service time is only until 6 pm. If it is at night To go out, you have to take a taxi or walk for ten minutes to Shui Wai. Because my birthday is in April, the hotel also sent a cake, which is very considerate. The only drawback is that the weather was hot that day and the air-conditioning was a bit insufficient. Overall, it was not bad.

The hotel has a free shuttle bus to Futian city center and the subway station, which makes commuting very convenient. The hotel has complete facilities and an outdoor swimming pool, but, strangely, there is no heating equipment, so not many guests come to swim. The room is average, and for breakfast you can walk to a nearby residential shop to eat rice noodle rolls or rice noodle dishes, which is pretty good.

msg:The location is about fifteen minutes away from Futian Port, which is quite convenient. However, the hotel is located near a residential area. When the swimming pool is closed, the only entertainment options are the bar and the fitness room. The fitness room is fully equipped and has a large area.
Our room faced the river and saw the port and farmland in the north of Hong Kong.
The room facilities are average and the water pressure is a bit weak, which is acceptable. Considering the price and year of opening, this standard is already good.
We booked a package ticket, which included buffet dinner and breakfast. There was a wide variety of food. We slowly tried all kinds of food in three hours. We also had free drinks. There is room for improvement in taste. Personally, I like that there are not too many customers. The environment is comfortable. Overall, Said to be cost-effective.
The restaurant waiters are polite and attentive.

msg:It's a great hotel, just a few minutes' walk from Futian Port, and there are buses to Futian, Shenzhen Bay and other ports, which is very convenient.
Although the hotel was built many years ago, it is old but not shabby, old but not dilapidated, and has a unique charm.
From the facilities of the room: the fabrics of the sofas and chairs are very good, very clean and noble; the sheets, pillows and quilt covers are all of the highest quality, and the mattresses are even covered with beautiful skirts; the coffee table tops are spotlessly clean; the bathrobes are embroidered with the Four Points hotel emblem; Even the water bottles are placed carefully, the bathroom metal is clean and scratch-free, and the lighting murals are exquisite... Zaizai insists on its five-star value.
The breakfast waiter is very polite, the food is rich and high-end, the restaurant environment is elegant, and an acrylic sign with "OCCUPIED" and "Please take a seat VACANT" printed on the front and back is carefully placed, so that people can know at a glance whether the table is available. Yes, but the waiter will guide us to our seats, so we won’t sit in the wrong place.
In addition, the Chinese restaurant has beautiful furnishings and a comfortable environment. It is well decorated during the Chinese New Year. The waiters are professional and courteous. The meals are diverse and the prices are reasonable. Guests can get a 100 yuan coupon.
Because this hotel is very large, with two buildings, the east and the west, and the inside is like a maze. When you first arrive, you may not know how to get to your room. Therefore, the staff at the lobby desk will ask the waiter to help carry our luggage and take us to the room in person.
All in all, it's worth staying. We booked an executive suite, which has a very high CP value. The only flaw is that there are no benefits for the executive floor. This may be because there are not many guests and it is not enough to support the establishment of the executive floor, which is understandable.

The young manager of the restaurant politely and proactively greets diners and understands their satisfaction, which is very praiseworthy👍👍

msg:The environment and location in Shenzhen are very good. My friends and I were planning to go to Hong Kong. Unexpectedly, the hotel also has chartered buses to pick up and drop off at various ports and Futian Station. It is really convenient! One night I came back late one night. After washing up, I called the front desk to ask for a cotton swab. It arrived very quickly. The service attitude was also very good and a very polite old man.

msg:This time I paid for the experience myself. The location of the hotel is quite new, and the room can also see Hong Kong. As soon as you enter the hotel lobby, you will feel like a four or five-star hotel. The lobby manager who checked in at the hotel also has very good service and handles check-in very quickly. It turns out that the hotel is divided into two buildings. We asked not to use a bathtub, so we were assigned a room on the 22nd floor of the west building. To get to the west building, we have to go through a long corridor from the 5th floor to get there, but basically at night There was no pedestrian traffic, and there was a door leading to a commercial building, but there were no lights on at the time. The location was quite dark and scary, so I asked the hotel staff to accompany me along this corridor. ￼

However, the experience in the hotel lobby is completely different from that in the room. The hotel is relatively old and different from the newer hotels now. It seems that the hotel really needs to be improved. Then we purchased this package which included dinner buffet and breakfast. Dinner was really scary. We went to eat at about 7:00. The food turned out to be sweet potatoes, corn, whole grains, and the poor food was not as good as what I saw online. Then I asked the waiter why he gave such food. It turned out Because there are tour groups, the food for the tour group is different from what we saved, and we were told that the food will be richer after 7:30. At this time, the food is really different. There are oysters, stewed soup, foie gras toast, and more frozen seafood. However, the seafood is really not frozen enough. I don’t think it is ideal. At breakfast, there are also group guests, so The overall restaurant experience was not very good, and the breakfast food was just average. So I left the hotel early and will not stay in this hotel again next time. Although it is a brand, I have stayed in Shanghai and Taiwan. Compared with this time, the experience is really not good. Won't stay here again next time. ￼

Because during check-in, I especially emphasized not to use a room in the corner, so I finally gave a room in the corner of 810. I was too tired, and I didn’t bother to bother. It was much worse than my friend’s room in 811. And it is said that the two adjacent rooms are actually adjacent in number, and there is still a small gap between the two rooms and the passage has to be turned around ? Or he didn't know the distance between the two rooms at all. The picture is from my friend’s room in 811. My room in 810 can’t fit an extra chair🪑. The floor of Figure 2 811, the carpet of Figure 3 810. By the way, there is nothing else in the room except toothbrush, soap, and moisturizer! Do not bring your own comb and razor, or take it from the front desk, so be environmentally friendly! that's the only way to understand

msg:This time when I came to the hotel, I realized that the book was wrong. It turns out that there are also two Sheratons in Futian District 😅. Anyway, let’s try it after book it!
In fact, the appearance and service of the hotel are OK, but it is slightly different from the hotel I want to live in, so points are inevitably deducted.
The front desk clerk is polite, but a little slow, which makes the people in line a little dissatisfied.
The room is overall satisfactory and very tidy. I like the twin room of the big hotel the most, because the two beds are big enough, so it is very comfortable to bring children to stay. The hotel is also very considerate. They sent fruits and cakes, which tasted good too. The only fly in the oin**ent of the room is the toilet. I can't flush the toilet after going to the toilet. Anyway, I don't want to change rooms after staying for one night.
Although there are not many styles of buffet breakfast, the taste is also very good. The little surprise is that there are spicy pasta.
The hotel swimming pool is also good, but it's a pity that during the swim, there was a thunderstorm warning and no swimming was allowed, but I also brought the children into the changing room to play in the hot pool, and played cartoons for them to watch.
In conclusion, the price and the quality are already very good, but it is a bit inconvenient to go out to play because of the location.

msg:Bad review! I do not recommend you to choose this hotel for the following reasons:
1. The family arrived by car, but the Sheraton had no service at the door, and no one came out to pick it up. After stopping for a minute, no one came out to pick it up. We asked the security outside to point us in the direction. We were dumb without saying a word. . . When I went there, I cooperated with the shopping mall next door to park the car. I felt bad when I came here. It didn't look like a five-star service at all!
2. After checking in, go to the west tower. It is so far away. It is too inconvenient to change the elevator every time you go to the fifth floor. We have a lot of luggage with a nine-month-old baby. No one helped to carry it. Compared with other hotels, we did not expect the service of Sheraton
3. After checking in, I found that there was no bathtub. I booked the room just to ask for a bathtub. As a result, I was given an upgrade of 99/night to get a larger area, and I canceled the bathtub and went to another room type. I didn’t write clearly when I upgraded, just wrote The area is large and the floor is high, which is deceiving. Knowing that I said that the baby needs a bath in the bathtub, I said later that there is no double bed room with a bathtub. Our family needs a double bed room and the baby sleeps together.
4. The crib, the iron rod, the baby got up and fell down and hit his head. Not a good design. there's nothing blocking it
5. Called the front desk to ask for slippers and said that there were no slippers, only one-time use, and I didn't know how to take a shower, so I went down and bought two pairs by myself. No slippers. . Such a big hotel star
6. The attitude of the front desk is also not good. I called and asked if there is no free breakfast for babies, and the time has passed. The reservation said yes. After a while, I said that I had a problem and asked the manager. I didn't want to deal with it at all, and it was rude. Many things have been confirmed many times and I am not clear, not professional enough! The hotel phone is often hard to hear, which is very annoying
7. When taking a shower, the water is completely flushed out, and the water is completely soaked. I can't say that the most common water leak can't be done well, so I can say five stars? ! Hehe, it was all blocked, and the washbasin couldn't go under the water at the beginning. It was said to press the middle of the hand to leak there. . Speechless, what kind of setting is this and it is not hygienic!
8. Looking at the scenery as a whole, there is nothing to see, and you still say that you overlook hk? hehe

msg:Facilities: Old. It’s hard to imagine that this is a Sheraton in Shenzhen. The rooms are irregular. The mattresses are two-in-one, which are two single beds pushed into one. The curtains are not tightly closed, and there is a big gap that allows the sun to shine through. Eyes, the air conditioner makes loud noise from time to time, and I have to stand in the bathtub to take a shower... I'm too lazy to take pictures and post pictures, so you can refer to other negative reviews. If I had known earlier, I would have slept in the spa next door.

The decoration and accessories in the room were not standard for this price range and Sheraton, and there were no service staff on the first floor! The reason for asking is that there are also rooms in their Sheraton in the back. In fact, they purchased a low-end hotel and then the room rates were based on those of the Sheraton. Bad review!

First of all, the front desk checks in with a bad attitude. I asked him when the check-in will be completed and told me that you didn’t read it. Are you in line? 5 stars for this kind of service? Secondly, there is no toothbrush or razor in the guest house used by the 5-star hotel during the holiday. I called the front desk 5 times and failed to answer. You won't even want to take a shower here! Don't live here, will you regret it?

I told me that I needed my deposit refunded, and she promised to refund it to me today. But I won’t refund the deposit. I have stayed in so many chain hotels. Is there any difficulty in refunding the deposit? Large hotel chains like this charge a deposit, which is nothing, so why won’t they refund it? And it’s not much money, so what’s the point of holding it back? Makes guests very uncomfortable!

msg:This is the worst five-star hotel I've ever stayed in. I don't usually comment on it. I can't stand it today. I don't want you to step into the trap. First, I came here in the middle of the night last night. There was no parking space. The security guard was very rude and told me there was no parking space here. There is no parking space here. You can go to the nearby spa to see if there is any. I said that there are no other places. Does your hotel have a parking lot? He said no, I love to stop, you can also park on the side of the road. Second, the front desk pointed me to a place to do nucleic acid. After I finished, I came back and told the front desk that the location you gave me was wrong. I searched for a long time and asked. A few talents were found, and it was a bit far from the place you gave me. The front desk replied to me, no, it’s there, and there was no word during the whole process. I’m sorry, I’m sorry. Won't your group send someone down to check? You can be so rude to customers, it's too speechless. Third, the hotel facilities are too poor. You have to stand in the bathtub when you take a shower. It's too slippery, especially for women and the elderly. Don't stay there if you are not careful. Slips and falls will be troublesome. What age is this, and this curtain is still used, and the decoration is too poor. Fourth, the hotel aisle, look at the picture, I am speechless. I have never seen such a hotel. It was too late last night. That's it, I don't recommend everyone to stay here. This is the worst hotel I've stayed in so many five-star hotels. Any Hilton, Marriott, or InterContinental is better than you. For real feedback, you need to be cautious when you stay!

2. The service is generally good. The front desk is very efficient in dealing with problems during the day, but no one answered the call to the service center from 12:00 to 1:00 am that night.
3. If you are sensitive to sound, it is not recommended to stay. The reason is that the sound of running water from the toilet in the next room is very clear until late at night. At the same time, the location of the toilet in the room is very strange. It will pump water from time to time and make a sharp sound similar to the pressure difference of the water pipe. The sound intensity is enough to wake up two people .

Because it is a Marriott member, the hotel also helped with free room upgrades, that is, the room is in the west building, and the lobby is in the east building. This time, it is not convenient to walk a lot to change the elevator... Overall I am very satisfied.

msg:This is the first time I encountered such an uncomfortable service. I rushed downstairs to go to the supermarket to buy sanitary pads in the morning. It only took two minutes to read the map. I couldn’t find it when I went out of the hotel. Where? What he replied to me was, you show the health code 😠 I said I stayed in this hotel, and it took less than a minute to get out. He said that whether you are a guest or something else, you need a health code when you go out and enter the door. I said I The question is where is the supermarket? He said there, you show the health code. I said that after I issued the health code, he said that if you show it, he will tell you. I understand the epidemic prevention policy when you show the health code, but please also remember that you are a service staff, I am a guest, not your prisoner. If you ask a question, the service answer requires one more condition, and the concept of humanized service should also be well understood. Study, go out the hotel door for one minute, turn around to go in, and check the health code. After reading it, the service staff told me, go in, go straight, and the whole service process is outside the glass door. Rigid and mindless enforcement of regulations. It's the first time I've had such uncomfortable service. I specifically looked at the name of the service staff. Ao Sun at the entrance of the hall. You need to study the service skills again, it does not meet the star rating of the hotel

It's very convenient to take a taxi to other places. 2. The service is good and very user-friendly. The room is not satisfied, and the room is changed without a second word. 3. The breakfast is relatively rich. Basically, everything is very complete. 4. The gym is larger and has all equipment. What's inadequate 1. First of all, the decoration of the room is too old and the room is small. 2. It's a pity that there is no heated swimming pool. The cold water pool is too cold to enter the water. 3. The biggest problem is that there is no shower room. Standing in the bathtub for showering. It is troublesome for the elderly or children to get in and out of the bathtub. It is easy to fall. This is a big hidden danger. The hotel must pay attention to improvements.

This point is for the fat aunt from the northeast at the front desk of the hotel. The hotel actually brought the name Sheraton. Is the service attitude the most basic? At about 12:00 in the morning on April 15th, my friend came to me and was asked to register at the front desk. That's OK, I'll go with you, not to mention high-end hotels. You are the front desk service of ordinary hotels. When you register, you Just talk well, it’s not that we don’t cooperate, the attitude is bad, we don’t know how to fill in the form, we start to get impatient after asking more than two sentences, and even scolded us, saying that it’s ugly to go to the government department to ask for help, but nothing When I encounter such a bad attitude, I really don't understand. As a hotel with the name Sheraton, why the front desk staff's appearance and service attitude are so unqualified in all aspects, I will put the bad review here. If you think I am exaggerating, feel free to You can call me. I can tell you what happened and when it happened. I felt uncomfortable at the time, but now the more I think about it, the more uncomfortable I feel. I spend hundreds of dollars to stay in a hotel and still get scolded.

The four-star hotel under the Sheraton has used the hotel conference room before participating in the exhibition. This time the room stay is not bad, except that the windows of the river view are much smaller than the promotional photos, and the windows cannot even be opened.

The downside is that eating at the 4F restaurant, I actually got a plastic piece on the black pepper sauce cowboy bones. After the on-site negotiation, the tea money was discounted, but this quality control really needs to be carefully checked! Eating is a lingering fear...

When I made a reservation, I saw that there was a spa experience coupon. I thought I would give it a try, but I didn’t expect that the spa would be closed due to the epidemic. There was no reminder on the Ctrip page, and the hotel staff did not take the initiative to inform it. I only found out after asking. Nor are there any other remedies. I checked in at about 12 o'clock in the evening. I put the water in for ten minutes, and it was all warm... I called the housekeeper and said if I would call the engineering depar**ent to see it, I felt a little embarrassed and proposed to change rooms. Shorter rooms with worse views (after all, the price is there and the service can't be compared with Marriott), but after changing rooms, there is still warm water... Two people took a warm shower at night... It was really cold. If it is such an experience, I think the price of five or six hundred should not be, at most three or four hundred...

五星級酒店的設備是如此的嗎？然後又說要找經理處理。前後等了差不多45分鐘還是沒有解決問題。真的太讓人失望，已經凌晨一點半還沒辦法洗澡，簡直就是受罪。
搞到凌晨兩點換了一個房間，比原本房間小不說，水量是大了還是水溫不夠35度，原本的免費mini bar,也沒有了，明顯房間降級的感覺。一切沒有讓人滿意的處理方式再度讓人失望，覺得被騙的感覺。讓整個原本的週年紀念日蒙上污點。

The breakfast is very rich, with both Chinese and Western food. Unfortunately, I didn’t take pictures, only the dinner. The suite I reserved includes a happy hour dinner, which also has Chinese and Western food, but there are not many types. There are also red wine, beer and drinks. I don’t drink alcohol. I just glanced at it, but I don't know what kind of wine it is, in short, the experience is very good, I recommend staying here.

我房間是包2人自助晚餐 跟 2人早餐， 到晚餐時 職員說街外食飯的太多，居然要我們住客等位置，什麼操作？
到早餐時 居然說我是沒早餐的？職員跟酒店溝通完 原來是他們搞錯，好好笑喔

晚上吃自助晚餐，味道還行，飲料種類就很少，服務員挺多了，收盤子很積極。快吃完的時候看那些服務員給其他客人都送龍蝦，周圍的桌子都送了，我們就沒有就很奇怪。

msg:萬豪旗下的酒店 本身多少是有抱着一些小小的期望的 但是可能真的時間比較長 很多設施都並沒有及時的翻新 不僅僅是外觀看起來十分陳舊 就算是使用起來 像洗澡的噴頭也之類的出水量根本就不夠

服務算是中規中矩 但要讓顧客去外賣櫃去取 真的還不如選擇其他品牌 至少還有機器人送上來

真的不是很推薦 雖然價格比較便宜 但性價比並不高

由於太急趕返工, 都忘記同前台講以上問題

早上自助餐就中規中矩。
午餐去了中餐廳，環境，服務，食物貭素。都一流。
基本上今個旅程都在酒店內，飲飲食食，和朋友們談天說地，沒有外出，避開平日繁忙工作的鬧市，享受二天的安寧。一樂也！

msg:提前打過12345市民熱線 諮詢過 明確表示 不需要48小時核酸檢測 出機場也沒有 任何人説要核酸 到酒店入住 非要48小時核酸  很無語。 乖乖去做核酸。 直到退房 沒有人看過我做的核酸記錄 我也是醉了 😵‍💫  根本沒人管理這件事情 還大題小做。 説衞生  房間要一直開空調 不開就有味道 很難聞。 開着空調很冷 很冷。 五星酒店也就這樣了  不會再來了  入住之前打過電話 詢問餐廳的問題  並沒有告知我需要預訂 導致 我網上付好錢後準備去吃飯的時候 沒有位置 被拒之門外  到餐廳 門口的服務員讓我進去 説 有位置可以快點吃  進去了以後又叫我走？ 搞笑🥸
