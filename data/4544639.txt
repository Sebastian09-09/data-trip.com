msg:he Hilton Haikou is a very well located hotel and probably one of the best in Haikou. On arrival there was a heavy rainfall which caused me to get quite wet walking from the taxi to the hotel entrance. I booked the room online via trip for me and my travel companion with the payment in hotel option. Online-Prepayment was not possible. On check in, given that I was very wet because of the rainshower I was quite unsatisfied with the service. First there was apparently some issue, wether I or my companion booked the room because the order of names on the booking showed my name in second place. Also my companion wasnt with me at that time because of a one day delay. In my opinion it shouldnt be a matter who booked the room since both of our names were given, regardless of the order. This issue took some extra time which is very inconvenient if you are dripping wet and just want to rest. Secondly when it comes to payment instead of the 1959 RMB, 2000 RMB were deducted from my WeChat account without any communication about the deviation. I also only realized it later when I already arrived the room and was very confused what the 41 RMB were for. Like I said it has not been communicated to me at all. Maybe a tip or was it meant as a deposit? (Even though it would appear to be a very odd deposit amount and tipping in China is not a thing) I guess from a 5 Star Hilton I could expect accuracy and clear communication when it comes to payment. Which brings me to another downside. Even though my Mandarin is sufficient enough, I was very surprised that at a Hilton of this price category none of the staff at check in nor other employees were able to speak English. So for foreigners who dont speak Chinese this would be a bit difficult. 
The next day I went down to reception again to ask about the 41 RMB and was offered a refund, yet the reason why it has been deducted in the first place still remains unknown to me. 
Another small issue appeared at breakfast when I asked one of the waitresses where the tea/ teabags is/are located. I formulated my request precisely in Chinese and the lady was just behaving awkward and walked away. I thought maybe still something would happen, but 10 minutes later still nothing. Luckily I was able to find the overseeing waitress, asked her the same question and found out that the Teabags are not openly presented at the buffet (Which is an unexpected inconvenience for a 5-Star hotel yet again, + the tea choices are very limited) 
My last complaint is the minibar. I have been at budget hotels before, which offered a free minibar which is refilled every day. Why are there so many things in this Hotel with a hefty price tag. This appears not welcoming given the cost of this Hotel. Especially the price-tag of minibar drinks is outrageous. For example 0.33L Tsingtao Beer 28 RMB…. Speechless. In every shop around you get 0.5L for less than half the price. Now that all my complaints about the service have been mentioned, lets move on to the many upsides of the Hilton:
-Great location and rooms
-Very good breakfast buffet with many choices
-Even better dinner buffet (298RMB/Person)
-Great panorama view
-luxurious 
-Some of the staff still did a great job, which is why I still give a 3/5 rating, regardless of previous issues.

I must commend the attentive service provided by William Wu at the 33rd-level breakfast restaurant, which truly enhanced my mornings and made each breakfast a delightful experience.

The breakfast spread offered an extensive range of options, from local delicacies to international favorites, catering to every palate. If you booked via CTRIP攜程, you will receive a complimentary dim sum for breakfast and welcome fruits upon checkin.

I will definitely be recommending Hilton Haikou to anyone visiting the area. Without a doubt, this will be my top choice for accommodation whenever I return to Haikou.

Head straight to the airport for my breakfast instead...

When boarding the cab, the bellhop were chatting among themselves. Only when my luggage was in the trunk of the cab they came over to offer their help... 

Personally I wouldn't recommend haikou hilton due to the uncoordinated communications and the service levels.

The rooms were clean, very comfortable, and the staff is amazing. They went over and beyond to help make our stay enjoyable. They were extremely accommodating and allowed us to check in early at like 10am. We got to hotel super early and I didn’t wanna wait. So this was a big plus. The sevice was exceptional as well.
This time some special circumstances occurred here in Haikou, and the Hilton all staff has taken care of us like a family members they had not let us feel lonely in this situation, they are always there for us to help us, trying there best to comfort us, send us basket of fruits everyday and even had offered us free breakfast. 
Thank you Hilton Haikou for such great hospitality.
I highly recommend Hilton haikou hotel.

My family and I have appreciated the accomodations.
It was a bit tricky that people in the reception cannot exchange in English. Such hotel ranking should have all people able to speak with the customers at least in English.
The breakfast space was full so the staff asked us to seat in another place. It was not convenient at all as we should move from one room to another room to take food. Also, the staff in front of each room asked to show them our key card each time to get access.

msg:In all honesty our stay at Haikou Hilton Hotel was less than impressive. Upon arrival we were ushered in to the hotel and then checked in by staff using broken English and translators which to be honest I really didn’t expect at a 5* hotel. We then came to our room and we wanted to order coffees and waited over 30min for them to arrive until finally we went out of the hotel and I received a call from a concierge who tried to solve the problem. The breakfast was in my opinion not worth the extra ¥210. There were very few Western options and it was mostly catered towards Chinese people. The room itself was ok but the shower had some problems and there was nothing in the mini bar and the tea and coffee station was like a poor after thought. All in all, we will not be returning to this hotel or any other Hilton in the near future.

There are many choices of food around, and it's a 5-minute drive from the Mixc. There is a Hema supermarket on the second floor of the hotel. If you live in an apar**ent, you can buy things and make something yourself. The check-in process at the front desk was very fast, there were not many guests and no queues, and the room was cleaned in a timely manner. Thank you Grace for your help during the stay, which delayed the check-out time. You need to take the elevator on the 35th floor to go back to the room. The breakfast restaurant on the 33rd floor also has a rich breakfast. I will come back again!

msg:This time I came to Hainan for a trip. I came to Haikou from Sanya Haitang Bay and chose to stay at the Hilton Hotel in the city. The overall style of the hotel is business-oriented. The guest rooms are on very high floors. I heard from Grace that this hotel is a landmark building in Haikou. The rooms are on very high floors with very good views. You can overlook the beautiful scenery of Haikou. You can also see the Century Bridge, the landmark of Haikou, from the room. The sunset and the night view are very beautiful. The manager Grace is very professional and responsible. It has greatly improved my impression of this hotel. Although the hotel hardware and details cannot be compared, the service is better than my experience of staying at the Edition and Capella hotels. The room price of 700 is absolutely cost-effective. Although the style and facilities of the guest rooms are relatively old, the service is impeccable.

msg:The hotel is located in Haikong Plaza, Longhua District, Haikou, facing the beautiful Qiongzhou Strait. Standing in front of the spacious and bright floor-to-ceiling windows, Haikou Middle School, Wanlv Park, Century Bridge gradually come into view, and Yundong Library can be vaguely seen. The hotel rooms are exquisitely designed and luxuriously decorated. Every detail reflects the pursuit of quality and care for guests. Whether it is the humanized setting of facilities or the exquisite bathroom equipment, it makes people feel at home.
Service is the core of the hotel. The staff of Hilton Hotel has won high praise from guests for their enthusiastic, professional and meticulous service. The front desk also upgraded me to a sea view room. In particular, Grace, the customer service manager, took the initiative to contact me, tried to meet my requirements according to my living habits, notified me to clean up in time, gave me an appropriate amount of drinking water, presented fruit for check-in, and helped me delay the check-out time. I was really moved.
This is my second stay. Hilton Hotel is the most cost-effective hotel in Haikou, no one. Whether it is a family trip, a couple's vacation or a business trip, you can find your own relaxation and enjoyment here. Every stay is a perfect experience, leaving warm memories!

The front desk staff, Ms. Ye Manyu, was very nice and took the initiative to add a daily breakfast for us for free, as well as drinks and fruit gift packs given by the hotel. Because it was not the peak season, there were not many varieties of afternoon tea, but there was no one there, and the environment was OK. The room cleaner, Wang Chunqiu, was also quite diligent in delivering water and other items. ￼￼The coconut milk pandanus in the breakfast was delicious. ￼The executive room is equipped with a washlet. ￼Because the hotel lobby is on the 35th floor, it feels that the elevator door closing speed from the 35th floor to the 1st floor is very fast, so it is recommended to adjust it slightly.

But they are all on the same floor, which is actually very convenient, and there will be no chance of falling down. Parking can be done both above and below ground, but to get out of the car underground, you need to ask the front desk for a QR code in advance, which is a bit troublesome. If you can park on the ground, just park on the ground. The service is also pretty good. I can't say it's meticulous, but the basic welcome reception, elevator guidance, and room service are all done. I was given a souvenir when I checked in. Because I felt unwell on the first day, I drank a lot of water and asked for two more bottles of water. The next day, the room service provided a few more bottles of water to the room. The details were perfect. The overall facilities are okay. The only thing is that the air conditioner does not heat. The temperature in Haikou dropped on the day I checked in. I woke up from the cold in the middle of the night. The hotel sent a heater, but it could only heat the air one meter around. I had a fever the next day and my trip was ruined. …Fortunately, you can order takeout. There is a takeout cabinet at the entrance of the hotel, but there is no robot to deliver it, so you can only pick it up yourself. The location of the hotel is not bad at first, and it is relatively convenient to businesses and attractions.

I would like to highlight Roger, the concierge, for his considerate service from check-in to check-out. He also arranged afternoon tea and light meals, and even took the initiative to delay check-out for me and my friends until the afternoon, so the overall experience of this stay was great. Very perfect! ! ! I will choose here next time I come to Haikou.

We had to change to the elevator twice to get to the lobby on the 35th floor of the hotel. It was not very convenient. There were only two staff working at the front desk. , there was a queue. I couldn't help but think that the staffing of such a large hotel was not adequate. Finally, we came to handle the matter. Fortunately, we met Manager Chen at the front desk.

Service: The housekeeper, Ya Nan, added WeChat in advance and helped to upgrade to a sea view room. It was just that the weather was not good and it was raining all the time, so I couldn’t appreciate the beautiful scenery.
Hygiene: I saw Xiaoqiang once and I really liked it; and the carpet in the house needs a good cleaning. If it doesn't work, just replace it with a new one.
Environment: The hotel is in a good location, absolutely in the city center. It is very convenient to walk to Wanlv Garden and Vientiane City; the internal environment is also very good, and it is pretty good to take pictures casually.
Executive Lounge: Slightly average. The repetition rate of dinner dishes is quite high. I stayed for three days in a row and more than 80% of the dishes were repeated every day. Don’t be afraid of repetitions. What I am afraid of is that they are not delicious and it will be embarrassing; but there is a clear supplement. The cold was pretty good; I only went there once for afternoon tea, and the snacks tasted okay, quite satisfactory.
Breakfast: There are many kinds of breakfast. I didn’t have much trouble after eating it for three days. It’s not bad.
Welcome fruit: Very good. You can take it back to your room after checking in. The drinks inside are delicious and the snacks are also good.
Exquisite Travel Photography: The guy’s service is very good and the photos are also good. It’s worth the money.

msg:Let’s talk about the advantages first.
Grace called to communicate before check-in and arranged a room with a good location. She also helped us apply for a late check-out and reminded us to arrange breakfast time.
The room service is good, providing laundry detergent and capsule coffee machine, coffee.

Let’s talk about the shortcomings,
The worst thing is that the management of the restaurant is chaotic. Even after being reminded to have breakfast at the wrong time, it was still overcrowded. The lady in charge of swiping my card at the door of the restaurant suddenly grabbed me when I reported my room number and walked to the restaurant and said I wanted to swipe my card. After I swiped my card, I took a step forward and was grabbed again and told to wait for guidance. There are designated seats, and from time to time during the meal, you can hear high-pitched card swiping and card swiping sounds. It is recommended to write it clearly at the door of the restaurant, so as not to pull and pull it, and to reduce the pain of being penetrated by the magic sound.
Other service staff in the restaurant were also cold-faced and did not even say basic polite words, such as please, to you.
It's obvious that restaurant capacity doesn't match hotel occupancy, but requires guests to sacrifice their time, endure chaos and bad attitudes. Moreover, the breakfast category and quality are relatively poor. After going out so many times, my family unanimously commented that the breakfast quality at Haikou Hilton is the worst.

The second worst thing is the swimming pool. There is no separate swimming area and water play area. People in the pool wear swimming rings to play in the water, which is very inconvenient for swimming. Many hotel swimming pools are managed separately to meet different needs.

Facilities: It is acceptable to have holes in hotel sheets for 300 yuan. At least put the holes where you can’t see them. At this price, it’s holes. Is the management too perfunctory?

The apar**ent is located on a low floor and has a sea view, but the view is average one kilometer away and the glass is dirty, so the sea view is of little significance. The room is really big enough to be 100 meters long. It has a washing machine and an induction cooker, but it's a pity that it can't be used. Especially the induction cooker doesn't have pots and pans, and the microwave is more commonly used. The sea view bathroom is good, but it is a pity that this type of family room design does not come with a bed for children. It is a pity that you can only pay extra for an extra bed, which is quite inhumane. I want to complain about the breakfast. I can tolerate the crowds. After all, it is the Spring Festival holiday. I understand, but the breakfast variety and quality are not worthy of this old five-star hotel. It is the worst five-star hotel breakfast I have ever had in more than 20 years, bar none. Hope it improves.

The room is more than 40 square meters, very spacious, with large floor-to-ceiling windows for easy viewing. We stayed in a sea view room, which was on a higher floor. It was really awesome. We could enjoy the day view, night view, sunny sky view, cloudy sky view and foggy sky view. The hotel's breakfast is rich, with many staple foods, snacks and dishes to choose from. Fruits and vegetables are new, and the dining environment is very good. You can sit at the window seat and enjoy the scenery while eating. The hotel was very generous. We needed more water for tea. We applied for a few more bottles of water and a box of 24 bottles was delivered directly to us! On a rainy and cloudy day in Haikou, the outside humidity reaches 98%, but the indoors are always dry, and the washroom and bathroom are also dry. I don't know how, it is indeed worthy of praise.

However, the standard room I changed to was behind the elevator room. The sound of the 4 elevators was too loud, which affected my sleep at night. Then I changed to a room far away from the elevator, but the bed was very uneven (other Hilton hotels I stayed in before didn't have this problem), and I still couldn't sleep, so I had to sleep on the sofa, so I made do with it. In addition, the sound insulation of the room is not good. These are all facilities issues, and a 5-star hotel should avoid such issues. The breakfast is relatively popular, filling but the ingredients are average. Overall cleanliness and staff service are okay. The location of the hotel is okay. You can reach Wanlv Garden in 20 minutes on foot. There are also shopping malls nearby.

When you check out, if you ask him if you can print out the check-in, he won't look at you and just print it out. He didn't say anything. I thought I couldn't take the taxi so I took my luggage and left. He called me again: "You don't want the list?" …
When you check in, you will not be given slippers and toothbrushes when you see children (when I checked in at Beijing Jianguo Bocui Hotel, there will be a greeter who will directly help you carry your luggage to the room. If you see a child, you will be given a handbag at the front desk. It contains children's slippers and other supplies), the price is about the same, but the service quality is very different...

It rained for three days during my stay. The glass in the room was closed, but there was a lot of water in the window and at the joint between the floor and the ground. I don't know if it was rain seeping in or fog. The room can only turn on the air conditioner but not the heater. The only good thing is that when I said it was cold, the front desk staff said they would send me an electric heater, which comforted me a little.
Not to mention waiting in line for breakfast, my child felt a little uncomfortable and called the front desk to ask for a medical care package. As a result, he sent me a "care package" with three cotton swabs and two cotton pads...
Also, I don’t know which company cleans Hilton’s sheets and quilts. Anyway, it is recommended to bring your own large quilts and sheets, and don’t bring disposable ones, because it is really not good. My daughter and I are two girls, and we will not feel comfortable when we come back. Female friends all know... So I did enough disinfection work and changed the disposable toilet seat every day, but I still couldn't prevent it...
I have stayed at Hampton by Hilton and Garden Hotel several times before. The Garden Hotel is as disappointing as the Haikou Hilton. It seems that I will say goodbye to Hilton in the future...

It was not disappointing, and the service was still very online! First of all, I would like to give real-name praise to the housekeeper, Miss Grace Wang, who helped solve one problem after another, such as remote guest room ordering, late check-out, and even helped change from an apar**ent to a hotel suite when it was almost early in the morning on the second night due to some special reasons. I was able to have a good night's sleep, and unfortunately my cold and fever symptoms also got some relief. I'm very grateful. Overall, it was a stay that exceeded expectations. The only small suggestion is that there is room for improvement in the dishes ordered in the guest rooms. It is not only a problem of taste, but also the temperature of the dishes is not enough, and even the oa**eal porridge I ordered was in the room. The 3 ingredients are completely different from what is written on the menu 😂 I don’t know if the online menu has not been updated, or the production is not according to the standards...

msg:First of all, Hilton Hotel is a star hotel! ! ?
But I seriously doubt that the hotel’s service is as good as its mid-range Hampton by Hilton!
The check-in service is average. Compared with the front desk service of a five-star hotel, it shouldn't be like this.
At about 12:10 noon today, November 18, there was a security guard in a light blue shirt and a white mask at the door directing the vehicle. The service was simply terrible! It's particularly bad! We are also staying guests, and you at least showed no respect. There were indeed many buses and other vehicles at the door. It was a Saturday, but you didn't smile. Instead, you looked restless and rapped on our windows with your fingers. What do you mean? He asked us to roll down the car window and listen to him speak. Is this your attitude towards guests? ! Is this the service that a Hilton hotel should have? What qualities! Not as enthusiastic as the security guard on the street, but polite enough to say "please".
If I go to Haikou again, I will definitely not stay at Hilton again!
I even suspect this one is fake!
what!

msg:Overall comment: Not worthy of a five-star hotel in every aspect. It’s all about deceiving people by overlooking the Qiongzhou Strait.
Trigger: When I was sleeping at night, I felt a big pit under my legs, and the middle part of the mattress had completely collapsed.
Hotel selection: I can’t understand the extremely low flatness design of a five-star hotel.
Hotel facilities: I inquired about the availability of a crib. When I arrived at 6pm, I was told that a bed was available, but the baby pillows and mattresses were uneven and I had to wait. The wait finally came, the corner wheels were not tight and the bottom of the bed could be separated. It was barely set up next to the bed, and the child was worried about it collapsing when he jumped.
Hotel service: 12 o'clock in the evening, which is of course relatively late, call the quick service center immediately. No one answered the phone three times. To be honest, I travel a lot on business, and even in express hotels, I have never had room service fail to get through. It's not that the line is busy or that the phone is out of order. The old British-style hotel is really tough.
Hotel location: I didn’t go into details. The location alone is considered excellent in terms of the bustling level, but parking is also quite difficult. I went there on a Friday night. The entrance to the hotel and the entrance and exit slopes of the parking lot were full of cars. , I walked around in a circle and went out, then came back in and squeezed into a seat. PS: I was so angry when I left, I called the front desk to report my car number and drove out. After leaving the parking lot, I actually got there. After paying the parking fee, I don’t know whether I should say I drove fast, the system was slow, or the parking lot was too small.
Looking at the location from another level, if you include the vertical location, the sea view is on the 35th floor + location. You need to go through the front desk again on the 35th floor and take an elevator to get to the room. Coupled with the eardrum discomfort caused by height, Gaode needs to be cautious about this.
Hotel management: It is a form of mixed management of apar**ents and hotels. Similarly, the price for double beds is more than 100 square meters, and the price for 30 or 40 square meters is more than 800. The difference is only one floor. So maybe a large apar**ent without transfer is more suitable? So what does it mean to book a high-rise building? Positioning is very unclear
Emergency feedback from the hotel: It was very difficult to find a new mattress. I went to the vacant room next door to pull out a mattress. I didn’t come back until the next day and said that I wanted to get a free room. I don’t know if that’s how the 4.8 rating came about.

The room was nice, very clean and tidy, no smell, and the bathroom was spacious enough. The only drawback was the room. The sofa surface inside is not very clean.
Traveling from the Hilton Hotel is also very convenient. In front of the hotel is the Esplanade, which extends in all directions.

The toilet seat automatically opens as soon as you enter the toilet room. It looks very smart. What I like the most is the view from the window of the store. The bathtub is right next to the window. Looking down from the 43rd floor, you can see the busy traffic on the Esplanade nearby, the bright lights of the Century Bridge in the distance, and the lush greenery of Wanlv Garden in the middle. Very good!

msg:I am so satisfied with my stay at the Hilton this time. The Hilton in Haikou is in a great location. There are several restaurants and Luckin Coffee downstairs. I don’t have to leave the building. Raining will not affect me at all. When I arrived relatively late, there was also a Zabai Vinegar Hot Pot open, which was delicious. I would also like to thank the butler Gary for contacting me in advance and thoughtfully upgrading the room, preparing fruits, and reserving a parking space so that I did not have to go to the underground parking lot. The room is huge, very clean, and the bedding feels good. The breakfast is rich in variety and the environment is beautiful. The window seat faces the sea. It is cloudy today. If it is sunny, you will have a sense of facing the sea and the spring flowers are blooming. The location is thoughtfully arranged. Members are given shrimp dumplings as gifts, and the waiters are responsible for cooking them. Good coffee, you don't have to serve it yourself, etc. The service is very good in every little detail. Overall, during my stay, no matter whether I checked in or checked out at the front desk, all the services were very considerate and comfortable. In summary, it is much higher than the DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel in Guangzhou that I just stayed in, both in terms of hardware room area and software services. Guangzhou Hilton has to queue to check in and there are no other services. I feel that the Haikou Hilton can embody the quality of an established five-star hotel.

The breakfast has more local Hainan characteristics, including various Hainan noodles, Hou'an noodles, pickled noodles, sour noodles, various colorful snacks, and the fruits are also very sweet. It's just that the prices are a bit more expensive during the National Day holiday, and you have to walk a few hundred meters past an intersection to get to Wanlv Garden.

We encountered a small problem with the room and the front desk staff actively solved it and changed us to a sea view room on the same floor. Afterwards, we called to express our apologies and were sincere and enthusiastic.
The next morning, the lock on the suitcase could not be opened. I called the front desk and immediately sent an engineer with tools to open the lock. It was very efficient and received 10 stars.
The buffet breakfast is very rich, and you can taste specialties from all over Hainan.
The only shortcoming of this stay is that you need to transfer to the elevator twice from the underground garage to the guest room, and the above-ground and underground parking spaces are tight. I am very satisfied with everything else.

There were not enough front desk staff. I continued to wait for half an hour to check in when there were not many people. There was a sudden power outage in the room the next day. Workers came to repair and the power was restored. As a result, there was a problem with the air conditioning system and it kept ringing all night. On the third day, I found someone to repair the room. They said the room couldn't be repaired and they could only arrange to change rooms. I stayed there for three days in total, and there were problems every day. On the surface, it seems to be a very positive ending. As a world-renowned hotel chain, in fact, there should not be so many problems in the beginning. Very unsatisfactory experience, I will never choose Hilton again in the future

msg:The experience of staying for a week was not very good. Problems occurred frequently from the first day. 1. The welcome fruit was not delivered during the day. I was reminded three times at 9pm and waited for more than an hour before it was delivered at almost 11pm. Then there was a sudden knock on the door at almost 11pm. I changed rooms, but it turned out that the front desk made a mistake. I was a pregnant woman who was frightened in the middle of the night. The next day, the hotel compensated me with a lunch. The apar**ent was too bad. The next day, I changed to an executive room. I thought everything was settled. But the front desk asked me to pay again and again. The room change made me confused. During this period, an inexplicable male waiter rushed to our room. The summary of the problem is that there is a problem with the hotel management. The front desk never verified the situation and always troubled the guests. The hotel later changed the room and said that coconuts and fruits would be delivered every day. When we stayed for five days, coconuts were not delivered at first. We had to ask for them at night before they were given. Later, fruit was not delivered and two coconuts were broken. One of them was broken today and we decisively decided to check out. The stay was too boring. When I checked out, I was told without verification. I paid a deposit of 10,000, but was told it was 7,000 because I was pregnant and my husband had a sudden illness and was hospitalized. When I checked out, I asked the concierge to help me put my luggage in the car and left it all around in the car. There is a shortcoming in hotel management so this big brand is extremely disappointed.

➡️Reservation: I don’t want to read so many reviews, just choose a brand that I want to stay in, so I made a temporary reservation. There are also coupons. It’s a good reservation.
➡️Check-in: The housekeeper, Gary, called in advance to ask about the approximate arrival time in order to better arrange the itinerary. He was very considerate and asked about the needs of the room, which saved a lot of time for check-in. The service was thoughtful and the customers were worry-free. He also welcomed us at the front desk with thoughtfulness and sunshine handsome guy
➡️Room: First of all, the room is very spacious and bright. Gary upgraded me to a sea view room. The experience is more perfect. But there is one thing that I think the decoration of the room is not in line with the aesthetics of young people. Another point is that the glass door between the toilet and shower room should have an extra layer It would be nice to have a film so it's more private.
➡️Location: The location is in the city center and it is very convenient. It only takes about ten minutes to take a taxi to the Live House (Flower Sea) at night.
➡️Breakfast: The breakfast is good at this price, and you can also see the sea view, thank you Gary
Because the schedule was relatively rushed, I only went to the swimming pool. The indoor swimming pool is great but relatively shallow
Overall it's great because of the service and will come back again

The attitude and tone of the male and female front desk service staff were very impatient from the moment they walked in to the moment they checked in.

First, the facilities in the children’s dry area close at seven o’clock, and the safety of the facilities is too outrageous. Should such a small amount of money be deducted for safety? There is still no sense of safety. . Since the gym can be open 24 hours a day, why should the children's facilities be closed at seven o'clock. Please don't treat the general manager differently, and safety is no small matter, don't be numb.
In addition, the breakfast food in the restaurant can't keep up, the business is so hot, and there is a long queue outside.

The hotel room was seriously aged and the sound insulation was poor. The arranged room was also unsatisfactory. There was a long wait for breakfast. It was also difficult to park in the parking lot. There were clearly signs on the ground. The security guard at the location wouldn't let me stop. This is the worst Hilton I've ever stayed at. Most importantly, water seeped out of the hotel's floor-to-ceiling windows on rainy days. Is this really a five-star hotel?

The hotel rooms are getting worse and worse. The carpets are disgustingly dirty. The smart toilets in the rooms are also broken and cannot be used. The most unacceptable thing is that water leaks from the floor-to-ceiling windows in the room. I went to have breakfast at the breakfast restaurant. The waiter had a bad attitude and didn't collect the food in time at all. Breakfast ended at 10.30, and everything was gone at 10 o'clock and was not replenished in time. The current check-in experience is much worse than before!

msg:Originally, I saw that Ctrip had some bad reviews. I didn’t know what to expect before I checked in, so I only booked a day to try and make mistakes. I felt pretty good after staying for one day. I was almost misled by those irresponsible bad reviews about humidity and eczema and missed the hotel, so I decided to explain it to help those who are about to move in to dispel their concerns:
1. The hotel lobby is on the 35th floor, with a beautiful view of the sea in front. The guest room is above the lobby, which is very comfortable and quiet. Although you need to turn the elevator once to go up and down the stairs, the mosquitoes are cut off to a certain extent, and you don’t need electric mosquito coils for sleeping. There is no small table in the middle of the twin room, and two 1.35-meter beds are pushed together to instantly become a 2.7-meter super king bed, which is especially suitable for families with children, who are not afraid of children falling off the bed.
2. The swimming pool is an indoor swimming pool on the 5th floor. It is operated independently. Hotel guests can use it for free. There are special changing rooms and cabinets are also free. The water temperature is moderate and the water depth is 0.9-1.2 meters. The locker room can not only shower in the rain, but also have a sauna room. It is necessary to deliberately not only wear a swimsuit, but also a swimming cap.
3. The price of the hotel is beautiful and cost-effective. The location belongs to the urban area. It is close to everything. If you plan to go to Qilou Old Street, Haida Night Market, and Sun Moon Duty Free Shop, it is recommended to stay here. It is also very convenient to order takeaway.
4. In terms of service, Wang Licheng, the Guest Relations Director of Haikou Hilton, called King in advance to learn more about the check-in time and needs one day before check-in, and helped with late check-out. He was warm and attentive, and had a very good check-in experience.

msg:Surprises continued from the beginning of the reservation.
1. The first call is to the hotel switchboard to inquire about travel photography. I was told that I need to call and ask. If the travel photography is not a hotel, you need to search it on Ctrip.
2. The second call asked whether the reservation was successful. I was told by the switchboard that they would check the order later. After hanging up the phone, there was no further information. Since I was traveling by car, I waited for the call all the way. Finally, I regretted it.
3. After the vehicle enters the hotel, you need to do it yourself to get off the vehicle and get your luggage. Don't think too much. Because the security guards and concierges are not likely to actively help you.
4. You have to observe clearly when the vehicle enters the underground parking lot. Because the barrier lights are brighter, you may not be able to see the railings. Because the railings have no reflective signs.
5. There is no exclusive parking space for the hotel after entering the parking lot. You have to spend time looking for it yourself. If you are lucky, it may take a few minutes. If you are unlucky, you can only turn around while looking for it. Because the security guards don’t know if there is any vacancy. parking space.
6. Check-in at the front desk can not find the order. It took about 20 minutes to find out that the hotel reservation depar**ent has made the date in 2032.
7. Since the front desk is on the 30th floor, I have to drag my suitcase and take the elevator to the first floor. I choose to go to the apar**ent floor. During this period, I saw the staff in the lobby chatting.
8. After entering the hotel, I put down my luggage and went out to eat. It was very late when I got back to the room. There were foreign objects in the floor sanitation. When the sofa was pushed, there were spider webs. Unidentified canned liquid.
9. The manager on duty came up to check and changed the room. He asked if there would be any sanitary problems. The manager on duty replied proudly that he couldn’t guarantee it. There was no word of apology during the process. So I asked to see the MOD of the day.
10. I didn’t turn on the TV because it was too late that night. So the next day the TV was the same as the picture.

😂😂😂 What's wrong with you, Haikou Hilton? Has no one noticed so many problems? Or no one cares. This is to give your boss a big surprise.

He didn't say anything and just walked into the room and asked to find the female waitress who was cleaning. My husband said you shouldn't be outside looking for someone. Why can you just enter the room directly? I think the hotel management is very problematic and has loopholes. How can you just enter the guest's room without caring about it? The experience here these days is indeed not very good and I am very disappointed.

Environment: The guest room has a relatively high floor and a good view. I have a city view on one side and a sea view on the other side, but they are not good. Downstairs is Wanlv Garden, which is also quite close to the Yundong Library and other attractions I want to visit. Overall it's pretty good
Service: Before arriving at the hotel, hotel guest relations Dany Wang gave me advance advice, understood our preferences and communicated the hotel check-in location in advance. He also upgraded our room. After arriving at the hotel, he also sent me information about the hotel breakfast, afternoon tea and swimming pool from time to time. The location and opening hours are very considerate.
Others: Finally, I want to talk about the executive lounge. I have very high expectations for the lounge. The afternoon tea and desserts are pretty good. The lounge is not big and the environment is relatively clean. However, there are not many happy hour varieties. I only focus on the drinks. Went, but there was only red wine and white grapes, no base wine, and no sparkling water (not sure if it was just not displayed)
Overall, everything else is pretty good.

As a frequent business traveler to Hainan, I patronize the Guomao Hilton every month, especially the Haikou store. I have stayed at this hotel for nearly 50 nights. However, due to the events that occurred on August 14, I have decided not to choose Hilton Haikou in the future. I hope the company can pay more attention to consumer experience and take effective measures to ensure that similar problems don't happen again.

Example: Welcome fruits are apples and money oranges. The lobby is on the 35th floor, and there is no direct access to the guest room. There are four elevators side by side in a row in the elevator room. When the elevator arrives, it is easy to miss the elevator (the distance is far). The front desk is suspected of inducing an upgrade to the room (be careful). At the same time, the dining environment is small and noisy. Guests are also loud in the hallway.
hint:
The door is not closed tightly, there is no other hotel that automatically alarms.
The good points are:
There are many sports equipment, the swimming pool is clean, the frequency of use is not high, and there is not much disturbance to the guests. The procedures are fast and convenient, and the check-out at 2 o'clock is convenient and calm.

msg:I went back to Hilton to check in again, and the receptionist was Flora from the guest center. The room I arranged was pretty good, and I lived very comfortably. During the check-in, I would actively ask if I need fruit and water. The hotel room facilities and equipment are quite good. The second stay experience is pleasant, it is worth recommending! ! Give her a thumbs up for her service, the hotel is full of New Year's spirit~

Whether it is the front desk of the sky lobby, the restaurant, or the executive lounge, the service is very good
Since I stayed for 20+ nights in a row this time, I moved from the hotel to the apar**ent, and I was pleasantly surprised. Not only was the room type upgraded, but the room was also very large. Washing machines and dryers are all available, and the beauties at the front desk are even more responsive. It will be resolved in a short time. Give five-star praise to all the beauties at the front desk of the apar**ent, and give great encouragement to JOY WANG.
Be grateful and be gentle in everything.

The hotel lobby is on the 35th floor and you can see the entire scenery from the Century Bridge to Xixiu Beach. Every time I come to Haikou, I stay at this Hilton. The service is as good as ever. From the doorman at the door all the way to the customer service at the front desk, they are super enthusiastic and enthusiastic. They take the initiative to help with luggage and deliver fruits. Mandy's service is very good, and she patiently solved my problems in every possible way. The hotel will contact me as soon as possible when there is a departure policy. The service is perfect. The hotel's facilities and equipment are also very good. During the epidemic, the hotel also took care of everyone very much. A guest's stay experience!
This Hilton in Haikou has the best physical examination since I stayed in Hilton! The overall experience from check-in to check-out is really NICE! I have a good impression of Haikou, and a beautiful impression of Hilton. I will still choose Hilton for my next trip!

msg:This is the second time I have come to Haikou. Last year I stayed at the Sofitel next door. I brought my children here this year. It is my first time to try this Hilton. The reason why I chose this Hilton at the beginning was that they have a suite apar**ent with one bedroom, one living room, one bathroom and one kitchen, which is convenient for children to have an independent space for online classes. Stayed for 4 nights and it was a great experience! Upgraded us to the largest apar**ent suite of 108 square meters! Helen, the account manager, is very good. He is very efficient and has a high emotional intelligence. He found out my preferences and needs within a minute of the phone call, and arranged for someone to send us an extra quilt and a complete set of kitchen utensils. The rice cooker is from Panasonic, the frying pan and the whole set of knives are from WMF. Hilton is really good at these details. I also love their big bathtub. I also thank their concierge staff for helping to print homework, papers, and service excellent

msg:First of all, the water pressure in the room is really much worse than that of my hometown in the countryside. Even if the water pressure is low, it can be hot and cold. The most terrible thing is that two people have to wait for half an hour for hot water after washing. The sanitation of the bathroom in the room is also not satisfactory. There are a few yellow things on the ground next to the toilet. Don't tell me it's marble texture, I just make marble. Does the marble texture still stick out? There are also a lot of long hairs next to the toilet. I have short hair. I only use this bathroom. At around 12 o'clock in the middle of the night, I heard two women arguing in the corridor. I could hear it clearly in the room. The sound insulation is really bad. In addition, the breakfast is also difficult to describe, there are too many people, our whole family went to the restaurant at 9:30, a lot of food was gone, and there was no replenishment until we left. Summary: A two-bedroom apar**ent with more than 2880 per night is not recommended at all. Even if you stay at the hotel, it is not recommended because of the breakfast problem. One more thing to add is that there is a real problem with parking. He only has a parking lot on the first floor. We had to wait for others to leave before we could park the car after we went out at night. I was lucky. I waited for 5 minutes for someone to leave. Know how long to wait! Of course, there are still advantages. Since I booked the room, the service staff called me immediately, asking me if I had any needs for the room, and also called after I checked in to ask me if I had any feedback on the room.

The front desk returned it to me I upgraded the room type for free, and I am very satisfied with the service attitude of the entire hotel. I have stayed in many hotels at home and abroad, and the service of this hotel is really impressive, especially the hotel's Leo, who is very careful about everything, because I have a cold recently and I am afraid of the cold. The hotel's heating system was not turned on, so Leo told the engineering depar**ent to turn on the heating system for me immediately.

After communicating with the front desk, I changed to a non-smoking room in time, but the toilet leaked. Another room was changed the next day. The hotel gave a free upgrade to the suite, but the curtains in the bedroom couldn’t be fitted. The engineer came to fix it and couldn’t fix it. It was broken before the explanation. The accessories I bought didn’t arrive because of the epidemic. I worked hard to solve the problem, so I didn't change rooms. It's normal to encounter problems during special periods. The hotel does not avoid problems, and actively solves and communicates with them, which shows a high professional quality. This kind of hotel is trustworthy, and I recommend staying at 5 stars .

The little girl in the hotel was beautiful and enthusiastic. Today, at 4:00 pm on the 13th, I am in a good mood. I have finished my work and I will leave the store tomorrow. I plan to go to the afternoon tea again. Today, Ms. Xie is a bit older, with a very unfriendly look on her face. I swiped the coupon for afternoon tea, and she directly packed the snacks and put them there. No professionalism at all.
I said, I haven't chosen yet.
Ms. Xie put on a lecture and quarreled state and said: You can only get tiramisu! ! !
I felt very strange: I chose dim sum at the afternoon tea last time, why can't I choose now? Besides, it was stated on my order that I can choose one pastry for 58 yuan.
Ms. Xie directly said loudly: That's because our plan hadn't been made or decided before, but now the plan has changed, and it's different from before, do you understand?
At that time, everyone sitting in the hall was looking at me. This Ms. Xie was acting arrogantly with her personal emotions, and she was unreasonable. She just let her talk nonsense and humiliate the guests. I was really scalp numb and very angry. I couldn’t afford it. A small snack, do you have to eat it? Or is the hotel recruiting employees too casually?
Take a look, the order includes breakfast. I dare not eat breakfast tomorrow morning. Once I was bitten by a snake for ten years, I was afraid of grass ropes. At that time, if it is another humiliating meal, I should not enjoy it. Included in the order, I was wrong, please don't humiliate yourself like I did
I won't come to this Hilton again, I'm away from home, I'm in a bad mood, what's this called
The previous good impression of other employees is gone, a black spot will ruin a glass of water, and everyone's efforts will be ruined because of one person's reckless behavior

The room was originally given at 3 o'clock. Then I still had a meal and then went there at exactly 3 o'clock. I didn't do anything special. According to the time limit, I would have to give the room a rest, but I had to wait until I got there. Wait, he told me to wait for 10 to 20 minutes. I waited for half an hour, and I was impatient. I went to the front desk to ask, and he said that he would send me afternoon tea, and he didn't want to just want to take a break. Driving for 10 hours was very difficult. I’m very tired. I’ll go to eat afternoon tea when I’m thinking about it. I don’t have any appetite for the things sent to me in the afternoon tea, so don’t hold out hope. It’s better to drive out to eat. I thought that a five-star hotel should be good, but I felt really bad. Parking is also troublesome, sea view room, go to the window and see the sea far away, the following is the urban area

Service: This is my least satisfied place. Most of them are good. The staff who help check in are all good but‼ ️The attitude of the doorman really made me feel uncomfortable. I came across the Consumer Expo hotel this day and called me in advance, but I only stayed in Haikou for one night and would not go anywhere. Even if I came to the hotel door and asked the doorman Where should I park at the hotel, I would suggest you to go back to another hotel and ask me how I would go back to the hotel. After some communication, I went to park the car. Then I went in the parking lot and another person said "no individual guests". To be honest, it's already very If you are not satisfied with the reservation, you can’t cancel it, and I have to come to live. Why can I still book a room on the platform since it is from the Consumer Expo?

msg:The apar**ent and the guest room are separated, so every time you go to the apar**ent, you have to go down to the 35th floor, then change the elevator to the first floor, and then change the elevator to go to the apar**ent. It was very troublesome. I forgot to take my things and ran three or four times in the afternoon. I was very tired when I went out. The fruit sent was also sent after asking the customer service twice. The room itself was fine, no issues. The question is, can the service be better?

Both check-in and check-out have to confirm with the staff whether the parking space in the HNA Building downstairs needs to be paid or whether the license plate number needs to be entered. They all said that the parking ground is not used, but in the end, they still paid for a day of parking.
I didn't have time to worry about it, so I talked to the security guard at the hotel downstairs, and asked to take a picture of my mobile phone number to contact me, but there was no call back.
I don't know if it is peak season, the service status is not online

Are you waiting for your children to get sick? ! My husband negotiated with the front desk, and the hotel agreed to change the room. The new room finally had warm air, hair in the bathtub, and tea stains in the teacup. I called the front desk to ask for a few bottles of water, but it took more than half an hour for them to be delivered. Work The staff still had an expression of reluctance, and they slept for a night. The next morning, the room suddenly lost power, and they called the front desk. I didn't come, because the bath water was cold due to a power outage, so I didn't dare to take a bath. I was afraid of catching a cold, so I simply washed up and went to have breakfast. Because there were too many people, there was no seat and I had to queue at the door. I am speechless. Is this really a Hilton Hotel? ! I started to doubt my life. . .

msg:This time, I decided to go to Haikou in a hurry. I hurriedly booked the Hilton Hotel on Ctrip. I felt that it should not be bad there, and it was close to the central city. When I arrived at the hotel, I was really amazed. The lobby on the 35th floor is also a proper landscape lobby. The blue sea is in front of me, and the coastline in the distance winds away, and I am stunned. ERIC YAO at the front desk knew that it was my first time in Haikou and Hilton. I booked a four-day basic room. Seeing that I like the sea view so much, I was upgraded to a sea view executive room. It is very warm and very thoughtful. Thank you so much! The landscape room on the 43rd floor is equivalent to being accompanied by the scenery every day, watching the changes of the scenery from time to time. From the rising sun in the morning, the bright red glow to the colorful sunset before sunset. From the clear and bright sky with clouds and clouds to the sky full of dark clouds and ink, all kinds of scenery are presented in front of your eyes one by one in front of the window. If it weren't for the repeated epidemic in Hainan, I still planned to go to Sanya. I told YAO that I must book the Hilton in Sanya, and I must book a view room. Haikou left me with a beautiful impression, and Hilton left me with a beautiful impression. I will choose Hilton for my next trip!

I really think the environment is good in all aspects, but the service at the front desk today is really bad... I booked a room for 7 nights (the room fee has already been paid online), and I paid a deposit of 10,000 yuan for check-in. I stayed for 3 nights, and when I went to renew the room card, I just met my boyfriend who was in a hurry and needed to go to the bathroom, because I couldn't get in without the room card. When I arrived at the front desk, I emphasized the first sentence that I could call my aunt to open the door, but the front desk ignored it and told me that my deposit was not enough and I had to pay another deposit. The deposit of 10,000 yuan is not enough to deduct the room fee of more than 3,000 yuan? what happened? Then let me pay another 3000 yuan? If the training is not in place and professional enough, then don’t work

msg:The good impression of this Hilton is all because of the flora. It was very sleepy to fly over with my baby in the morning. They arranged a room for us in advance so that I didn’t have to wait until 3 o’clock, and gave us welcome fruits and water. I also quickly brought a bath bag when I gave my baby a bath at night. One thing to say, remind the guests with children behind that the coffee table here is a family-friendly coffee table with sharp corners. The guests have to take care of the children. It was my family who accidentally bumped into it. When the waiter came to deliver the water, he was crying bitterly. , I was swollen from Haikou for the whole trip 😭 In addition, the Chinese restaurant in this hotel is very unpalatable. The serving was so slow that I fell asleep on the table. There is also a fried rice pad hungry. I can't wait to explain to the waiter to help me deliver it to the front desk I went back to my room to sleep first, but I didn't deliver it at night. I called the Chinese restaurant the next day and no one answered the phone. After I gave the first bad review in my life, I immediately called the hotel room and said that I wanted to give me a piece of fruit. , why did you go early? I didn't ask for this fruit.

Very warmly arranged the fruit plate, and recommended the room to settle in. Hotel location is very good, travel is very convenient. Although the hotel's equipment is old, the front desk and room service are very good, which makes up for the regret of the equipment. The breakfast buffet is delicious.
When I checked in at that time, the breakfast was not good. Because it was a second stay, the little brother at the front desk sent another buffet breakfast.
In short, I will choose this hotel next time. It is really good, it is very cost-effective, and the service provided is also very sincere. The downside is that the front desk is on a high floor, the first floor is a bit messy, and it's nice to sit in the room and watch the scenery, which is a big plus.

The handsome guy at the front desk is very enthusiastic and offered to help us upgrade the room and save a lot of money. He also carefully gave us the couple. When I introduced the hotel's facilities and breakfast, when I checked out, I met him who took the initiative to ask if we were staying well or not. With such employees, it is difficult for a company to make money.

The first time you enter the lobby, the concierge jim will kindly ask you for the health code and itinerary code. I think this is very good. At the same time, the disinfection work of the hotel is also in place.
The sheep grant and the duty manager Xiao Yao at the front desk where I checked in were particularly impressive.

msg:Chris**as trip to Hainan, the first stop is Haikou. I stayed in Haikou for two nights, the first night at the Ritz and the second night at the Hilton in the city. At that time, the lady at the Ritz asked me why I didn't choose the Sofitel, saying that the facilities at the Hilton were already very old and the prices were similar. But after I actually checked in, I found that it was pretty good and the carpet was very clean. I booked an executive sea view, and the lady at the front desk upgraded me to an executive sea view suite. It was cloudy when I checked in and it rained the next day, which was a bit depressing. Otherwise, the sea view would have been absolutely unbeatable. The most important thing is that the service is better than the Haikou Ritz. I don’t know. How many times! ! Although I didn't help with my luggage, when I arrived in the room, a cleaning lady came to ask if I was satisfied with the cleanliness, if I needed any help, if there were any items that needed to be replenished, and later the hotel also called me on my mobile phone to ask if I needed any help. , it’s really warm for me traveling alone. The only thing lacking is that the executive lounge environment is very ordinary, and you can't even see the scenery outside the window. The Hilton’s Chris**as afternoon tea is actually quite good and very nice, but I couldn’t eat it alone, so I bought a small Chris**as tree tea. It tastes good~ Next time I stay in Haikou, I will choose Hilton! !

The service is in place, very enthusiastic, and very moved. Entering the lobby, the a**osphere of the New Year is strong, the God of Fortune Tree, ingots, etc. are placed. The splendid chandeliers and decorations of the lamp wall come into view, which are very high and airy.

This is also my family's journey along the way, and I found that Hilton Haikou's epidemic prevention work is very serious, and it has to be recognized. The concierge manager Jake took us to the 35th floor to check in responsibly. What was confusing was that the front desk was on the 35th floor. Really extraordinary. Standing high above, looking far into the past, a mirage emerges from the vast sea, really 66666. Una, the pretty girl at the front desk, helped to check in enthusiastically and professionally. In order to let us have a good hotel experience, the room has been upgraded for help, which is very touching. A very user-friendly service hotel. It is worthy of being an online celebrity punch card. The room was clean and tidy, and the lady on the floor greeted us warmly. like training. Very comfortable 😄. The breakfast is on the 33rd floor, with a wide variety, but there are many people and there are still queues. The environment is good. We sit by the window and watch the sea while eating, which is very comfortable. There are many people in the restaurant, and the service staff did not hear it after calling it several times, but it did not affect our dining mood, so we had to do it ourselves. The restaurant management is relatively chaotic, and it is recommended to strengthen this management. In the evening, the cloud bar on the 55th floor is worth a visit. It has a different taste. A place for young people. The next day I checked out and went to Sanya. The concierge manager Jake took the initiative to help arrange luggage collection. Maybe this hotel's service impresses me. If you have another chance, come to Haikou, the hotel still chooses Hilton Haikou. Really good, worth recommending

The coconut chicken at the Siwutang downstairs is also delicious. If you live here, it is highly recommended! Very close, 15 minutes walk. come here next time

msg:The security guard at the entrance is very enthusiastic to give a good first impression of the stay. The location of the hotel is very good. The high-end area of Haikou is very close to Wanlv Garden. Walking and running are very good. , this is a plus point, the only thing is that the attitude of the breakfast noodle-cooking sister is like a street stall. It may be better for the street stall to work for herself. Can noodle cooking not recruit young people? The accent is serious communication difficulties, I always try my best. In short and standard Mandarin, I needed two bowls of noodles, half noodles, and ordinary wontons. She used a serious accent for a long time. I need to guess what I need to guess, and then asked how to divide a portion of 6 wontons. I understand it in terms of attitude, and I receive so many every day. Guests, other young colleagues do not also receive many guests, why not like her! Comments do not intend to hurt anyone, I just hope that according to the feedback, we can reach the quality standards of five-star hotels. This is the international standard that international tourist islands and free trade ports should have after the country reopens.

Even though there are adults next to him, he does not dare to finish it by himself. My son has always been very daring. Maybe the color is too dark. Is it better to increase the lights in the children's facilities?
And living on the 30th floor, the toilet will be blocked, I don't know if it is a legacy problem of the building;
But in terms of service, it's really good. Even the interns are very nice and professional. I would like to thank Edana He at the front desk, because with two children, she provided meticulous and thoughtful service, and it was very fast. So I have to feel that Hilton's overall training is still in place;

The lady at the front desk received a warm reception from Chloe, and also upgraded the first-line Gaohua sea view room and gave us welcome fruits. After check-in, I sent it to the elevator entrance. After check-in, the caring and greeting service was meticulous. I really felt the warmth of being at home. When I entered the room, I was greeted by the invincible open sea view and the green lung of Haikou City, "Wanlu Garden". Immediately I was relaxed and happy.

msg:Haikou Hilton has never had a bad review. Except for the convenient location, the software and hardware services are useless. First of all, the hotel is above the 35th floor, and the lobby is on the 35th floor. We need to transfer the elevator at B1 to the 1st floor, then transfer the elevator to the 35th floor, and then transfer the elevator above the 35th floor to enter the room. There is no bellman in the basement. If you have more luggage, you have to take it from the basement to the 1st floor. There is no special parking space for hotel guests in the basement. It is together with apar**ents and office buildings. Parking depends on luck. Every time you pick up a car, you need to scan a parking fee reduction code, which is very inconvenient. Let's go back to the hotel, the room is very hot and I can't control the temperature by myself. It was 27 degrees for the first time, and I didn't sleep on the first night. Someone from the engineering depar**ent said that the air outlet is small, and we can change rooms. , the bellman came empty-handed, without bringing a luggage cart, and went down to pick it up again. The second room is also hot, 26 degrees, and it can't stay crowded during the day. Stayed for three nights, and every day I came back, the room card could not be opened. There is a smell in the room and it feels like the carpet has not been deep cleaned for a long time. In a word, this is the Hilton with the highest living and the worst service. It is not recommended for vacationers.

The apar**ent space is quite large, which is very suitable for family travel options. The service is also very good. If you want to make a comment, it is that the hotel’s parking spaces are not enough, and there are often many cars parked in front of the hotel, which affects travel. Of course, in Haikou, this one should be considered competitive in all aspects, and I will choose here next time I come to Haikou.

Said to do it upstairs, upstairs said it can also be done on the 1st floor, we dragged our suitcases, no one asked if we needed help, there was no prompt during the whole process of check-in, the check-out time, breakfast floor, and matters needing attention did not say anything, check in There is a lot of luggage in the back, so I asked the front desk if I could help you with it. The front desk said that you can take it yourself first, but we got the room by ourselves. The sanitation of the room is miserable, and the bathtub is so obviously dirty, who dares to use it? The equipment is also very old. The funniest thing is that I can't type the check-in details. What room vouchers did the front desk reply to use and can't provide them? I ask what room voucher? We don't have any room vouchers for the online payment. The hotel reply can only be provided by the website. After looking for the website, the website responds to ask the hotel to provide it. It's really speechless! ! !

msg:The experience is too bad, I suspect that I live in a fake Hilton. 1. The parking lot of the hotel is very small, and there is no space every time we go. The security asks us to park in the underground (shared by the shopping mall), and there is no space when we drive down. He actually told us to park in the opposite community? ? In a five-star hotel, every time you park your car for two days, you have to wait for 20 minutes to get a seat. 2. The bathroom of the room is actually a storage water heater. After one person takes a bath, the second person has no hot water for half of the bath... At night, I want to take a bath, but I put a third of it and there is no hot water. I wait for an hour for the water heater to heat up, and the bathtub is full. It's cold again. Not to mention five-star, the express hotel also guarantees hot water supply. 3. There is no socket in the bathroom, and there is no place to plug in the hair dryer, so I can only blow it in the living room. I want to curl my hair in the morning, there is no place to plug it in the bathroom, and there is no mirror outside, so I can only give up. 4. The swimming pool is outsourced, it is very shallow, and it is impossible to swim at the waist position. If you are not with children, you will definitely change hotels. It’s really the first time I’ve stayed at such a poor Hilton, at most a three-star level, I don’t understand where the 4.8 praise came from (the hotel called for a return visit, I heard that the experience was not good, the manager immediately added WeChat to communicate, or praised it all That's how it came.)

[Room] It is an open apar**ent, it should be 100 square meters, with a wide view, a small living room, washing machine and kitchenette, so you can cook by yourself. There is still a certain distance from the sea, so the sea view and the city view are combined~

[Dining] Breakfast is very delicious! I can’t forget the seafood porridge, I have everything that I should have, but the Hainan-style paolo noodles feel average~ there are many people in line~
Downstairs is Hema. Order a seafood takeaway and borrow a pot from the hotel to make it yourself. Watching TV while savoring food is very pleasant. Of course, it can also be called burnt. The Hema prawns downstairs are very fresh, and the other oyster crabs are average, for reference~

[Hotel appearance] It looks like a bullet, with a high degree of recognition, and the style is more biased towards business buildings

[Lobby] It is quite satisfactory, the apar**ent and the hotel are checked in separately, and the elevator and the room are also separated~

[Location] It is nearly an hour away from the airport, depending on the road conditions. To go to the beach is to take a taxi, there are shopping malls around, coconut chicken is also good.

[Sanitation] Clean and tidy, no faults can be found

[Service] Very caring and loving, with butler contact and reminders, you can feel warm in a foreign country

I am very very satisfied overall, and would recommend it to other friends, Haikou is the first choice for staying in Haikou~

The lower floors of the hotel are serviced apar**ents. The buffet restaurant is on the 33rd floor, the lobby is on the 35th floor, and there is a gym and children's swimming pool. The paradise and swimming pool are on the 5th floor. The water temperature of the swimming pool is a bit cold for girls, so they need to swim constantly. The water level is not deep, about 1.4 meters. The children's pool next to it is like a hot spring. The executive lounge is on the 57th floor. You need to transfer to the elevator to get up or down. It is quite convenient to transfer. The sea view room has a wide view, and the Qionghai Strait is outside the window. Unfortunately, the exterior glass is a bit dirty, otherwise the experience would be better. It rained for two days, and when I checked out, I found that a lot of water leaked between the curtains and the floor-to-ceiling windows. This is Executive sea view room. The customer service staff are very clean and can handle any additional needs in a timely manner. The hotel's breakfast and seafood buffet were average, and the waiter's service was pretty good. The children's entertainment area at the entrance was too hot. It felt like there was no air conditioning. The air conditioning in the room was not very effective. Even though it was adjusted to the lowest temperature of 16 degrees, the room temperature still showed 23 degrees. , I don’t know if it’s because the floor is too high. During my stay, I received a call from the hotel’s satisfaction survey. It was reported that the number of welcome fruits was less than in other rooms. The customer service said that another one would be delivered at 10 o’clock the next day. I didn’t see this fruit until I checked out🤔

The welcome fruit that is said to be delivered needs an online reminder, there is no self-service laundry room, and there is no hook for drying clothes in the room. Pay more attention to details to reflect the difference between luxury hotels and ordinary comfortable hotels. It shouldn't be a second time.

The service is superb 👍, especially the lady Echo customer service lady who is very caring and heartwarming. She also upgraded us with a sea view room, full of touch and gratitude. It will also remind us that it is raining outside. Remember to bring an umbrella. What are the requirements for the first time? I will solve them one by one, because of the kindness of this beautiful and lovely lady, we stayed for three nights 😊, the hotel environment is good in every aspect, but I have to say that when you come to Haikou, you must stay at the hotel ❗️❗️

It is not depressing at all and there is a washing machine and refrigerator. The point is that the Hilton bed is really good. It's too comfortable, but it happens to be the National Day breakfast. Many people need to wait in line for half an hour. It is recommended to eat early 😋

The lobby is set on the 35th floor, and you need to transfer to the elevator on the 35th floor to get to the room. A welcome fruit plate was delivered when checking in. The decoration details of the room are good, the bed is moderately firm, and the pillows are still Hilton’s regular choices. I like the slightly firmer buckwheat pillows. The toilet is a Kohler smart toilet. The breakfast buffet is relatively less variety, and the setting is rather confusing.

第二晚住了45層的酒店，房間的裝修和佈局檔次要高一些，但是夜間空調噪音略大。
第三晚繼續調整到樓下公寓。
早餐：自助早餐種類豐富，但味道一般。相比較同級別酒店，萬達和萬豪的早餐更好一些。
酒店北門右轉直走10分鐘左右，有一家早茶店，自助早餐不想吃，可以去試試海南早茶。
酒店一層後門有椰子雞，第一天入住不知道吃什麼，椰子雞首選哦。

msg:It was late on the day, and there was no one at the door when the car came down. Turning around, I saw two concierges chatting not far away, asking them to come and help with their luggage. At first, I was a little confused when asked if I was a hotel or an apar**ent. It turned out that after entering a gate, hotel guests went to the 35th floor to apply for CI, while the apar**ent was on the first floor. Going to the 35th floor, the front desk said that the apar**ent is also managed by Hilton and all services are the same. Considering the large area of the apar**ent, an apar**ent was chosen. After I checked in, I found that the soundproofing was too poor. The lively Yazi next door would knock on the wall from time to time. When I knocked on the next door, our room would be loudly sounded. I was frightened a few times. After staying in the hotel for one night, I put the bedding change card on the bed, but the wrinkled bedding and the uncleaned hair on the bed all showed that the bedding had not been changed. The empty bottles of used shampoo and shower gel were not thrown away, and the new ones were not refilled. Speaking of this, Haikou is already hotter, shampooing and bathing more often, but the shower gel shampoo is only 17ml, and only one set is not enough. Can you consider putting two sets or at least replacing it with 25ml . In addition, after drinking the capsule coffee, I did not make up for the next four days. Ctrip users should have welcome fruit, I haven't even seen a banana. The guardrail in front of the French windows is loose. This room should be a special-shaped room, often tripped by a staircase on the corner, this design, flaws in a mess. I ate two buffets in the restaurant. The food is single, which is not very suitable for five-star hotels. It is even more necessary to call to collect plates. Staff of various types of work pass by you and will not take the initiative to help you get dirty. Take away the plate. The service of the swimming pool is not bad, even if there is only one person in the pool, the lifeguard is always present and staring at the pool. The location is also very good, not far anywhere. Although the staff in each position have their own business abilities, their attitudes are quite good. Next time I go to Haikou, I will stay at Hilton, after all, Haikou does not have as many choices as Sanya😂

Each room has a bathtub and the bathroom is big enough. At first, the air conditioner was broken, and the waiter made changes and adjus**ents in time. Thanks Song Beauty and the manager on duty!

msg:A very good and perfect experience. Stayed in Haikou due to the weather, and stayed in the hotel room all the time. The room was cleaned very well, the front desk manager Nancy was very enthusiastic and the room was very tidy! The service of Eric Miro at the front desk is really great!
The hotel’s breakfast types, the restaurant’s scenery is good and the service is good, I especially like the breakfast a**osphere!
The sea view outside was okay. We just caught up to the Shanghai mouth. The weather was good, and the sea and sky could be seen through the windows.
The room is very quiet, so the family can get a good rest [smiley]
Overall, it is highly recommended that everyone choose Hilton Hotel to stay!

The room was very clean, because of the boat, we arrived very late (about 12 o'clock). The room was clean and the size was just right (the picture was taken after we messed up, regardless of the hotel)
The breakfast at the hotel is pretty good, with all kinds of meals, and many types.
The sea view outside was okay. We just caught up to the Shanghai mouth. The weather was good, and the sea and sky could be seen through the windows.

Special thanks to Miss Nancy and Miss Nita Sylvia at the front desk for patiently solving problems for me, super gentle, and my doubts were answered perfectly. The service of the hotel is really good, so I chose to stay for another 2 days! After confirming the itinerary, it should continue for a long time. I have nothing to say about the hardware, but the software is the key to my continued choice of Haikou Hilton! I really want to highly recommend it! In addition, breakfast was given, which was rich in variety, clean and hygienic, and the service was super in place (casserole porridge, broccoli and eggs are all delicious). When I went out in the morning, I threw the contact lens box on the wash table. When I came back in the evening, it was neatly laid out. It was really considerate, and everything needed was handled quickly. The takeaway from the hotel is also pretty good. In short, the humanities care is in place, I recommend everyone to try it! ! I won't regret o(^▽^)o

msg:There are two Hilton hotels in Haikou, one is the Hilton Luneng located on the seaside of Meilan; the other is the Hilton HNA located in the main city. Due to the longer stay this time, I chose this one that is more flamboyant in the urban area.
The hotel is located in HNA Plaza on the south side of Binhai Avenue. Binhai Avenue should be the main road of Haikou from east to west. There are more than ten bus lines at the bus station in front of the hotel, which can go to every corner of Haikou City. HNA Plaza is still the tallest landmark building in Haikou. The north side of the hotel faces Haikou Bay, from Haidian Island, Century Bridge, Wanlv Garden in the east to Xiuying Port, National Sailing Base and Holiday Beach in the west. On a sunny day, you can also see the Haian Port of Zhanjiang on the other side of the Strait.
All the staff in the hotel are very warm and friendly. The guys in the concierge depar**ent not only collect the express, but also help us unpack the difficult outer packaging. Every member of the housekeeping and restaurant staff remembers our habits and preferences and makes us feel welcome.
Special thanks to the five girls in the Executive Lounge on the 57th floor: Sally, Alyssa, Lina, Max and Ling, thank you for your meticulous care every day!
This trip to Haikou chooses Hilton Hotel, which makes us feel that the spring of Haikou in 2022 will be warm and heart-warming!

The concierge brother Jason Xiao Chen was very enthusiastic. He took the initiative to greet and help with luggage, and quickly handed over iced mineral water. , Let me feel the slightest coolness in this hot summer. When I arrived at the front desk on the 35th floor of the legendary Sky Lobby, the front desk guy (I don’t know how to write, I only know Millau) checked in very enthusiastically. In order to increase my love for the hotel, he arranged a higher-floor room for me and helped delay Check out, thank you very much. The room is clean, tidy, and the sea looks good. The bed is very comfortable. There are many types of breakfast, and the taste is good. Sitting by the window and eating while watching the sea, it has a special charm. Since the flight was in the afternoon on the same day, Jason from the concierge depar**ent helped to find the brother at the front desk to apply for a late check-out. It was very human and thoughtful for customers, and it was in line with Hilton's service mark. This time I stayed at the Hilton Haikou Hotel, which really made me linger. Next time I come to Haikou, I will choose Hilton Haikou

Upgraded the room for us so that we can take care of our two children easily. At the beginning of the first room, the air conditioner in my parents' room was leaking seriously and called the customer service. Before the customer service came, Liang Zhenzhen called the room and asked me to wait for the room card in the room to prevent us from running aimlessly with the box. My parents completely forgot the episode of leaking air conditioner and praised Zhenzhen again and again. The air conditioner leaked once the next night. We called the customer service and asked the master to repair it. Liang Zhenzhen was resting at home that day and learned that the air conditioner leaked again last night. WeChat appeased us and applied to let us go to the 33rd floor for breakfast. I have stayed a lot. The local Hilton This is what impressed us the most. Such employees Hilton will do better. Even if the guest team’s hardware is dissatisfied with this kind of service, it’s nothing. My parents strongly asked me to write a letter of praise to Zhen Zhen. Zhen Zhen learned that she should be polite and refused to say that this is what she should do. We can only use the Ctrip platform to thank Zhen Zhen. Zhen, come to Haikou to come to Hilton to experience Liang Zhenzhen’s service

🔔Service: This hotel is really difficult to park, I avoided lightning, it took 40 minutes to park, and the security guards still didn't stop at some parking spots! 😡 The security guard at the door was still impatient. I told him that there was no place to park, and I complained that there were so few places. Before I finished speaking, he interrupted me, and then asked me to take a better attitude. excuse me? ? ? ? ? Does he stay in a hotel or I stay in a hotel, I didn't say anything, just want me to have a better attitude? Whoever has a bad attitude is full of anger, really angry... Next time, I will definitely find a hotel with a parking lot and a polite hotel. It’s not that the money is short, and I’m still angry when I stay in the hotel. 🐮 He also said that there is no parking space, so he can’t help it, but there are several next to him, and they won’t park. Maybe it’s just for luxury cars 🙃 It’s because we are not worthy
🚗 Transportation: Does this hotel have transportation? ? ! !
🧹Hygiene: Hygiene is not bad, in all fairness, it's a matter of fact.

Xiao Luo, the manager of the welcome depar**ent, greeted me very enthusiastically and actively helped me with my luggage, led me to the 35th floor to check in, and gave me water and introduced hotel dining information. Seeing that my mobile phone was out of power, he took the initiative to charge me with his charger. A very professional guy. In him, I saw the enthusiasm and service that a hotel service staff should have, and praised Ronaldinho. At the same time, the beautiful woman who checked in (the English name is very long and hard to remember) seems to be Charlotte. She is very professional and enthusiastic to help me check in. Seeing that I did not order breakfast, she specially helped me apply for breakfast. It is very human. The service is very good. Also like her. When I arrived in the room, the room was clean and tidy. It was really pleasant to watch the sea from such a high floor. There are many kinds of breakfast, good taste, but there are a lot of people. Very noisy. But I was very full and satisfied. After checking out, I went down to the first floor. The welcoming guy, Kevin was very enthusiastic and took the initiative to help me load my luggage into the car. This time I stayed at the Hilton Hotel in Haikou. Overall, it was great During an experience, the hotel staff were very enthusiastic, especially the service of the concierge. I was particularly impressed. I will stay there next time I have the opportunity and I will recommend it to relatives and friends. Thank you.

I asked for a latex pillow and delivered it to the room in time. There is also a phone call to check my accommodation experience.

I will contact you one day in advance. The front desk is also very nice. The breakfast is okay, but the level of the restaurant service staff needs to be improved and trained.

msg:這是我第二次入住了海口希爾頓酒店，每次過來入住都能讓我感受到賓至如歸的感覺。
接待我們的前台姑娘樑榛榛，服務非常棒，熱情好客，很為顧客着想，為了讓我和我的家人有一個愉快的住店體驗，就給我們升級了看海的套房，房間衞生乾淨整潔，看海效果不錯。知道我們沒有早餐。主動幫忙申請早餐體驗（據説是33樓海景餐廳，景色宜人）另外一點她還告知説酒店有管家服務，這點非常棒。直接推了禮賓管家羅傑（三亞老鄉）樑榛榛服務非常讓我很滿意，希望貴酒店多培養一些像樑榛榛這樣的優秀員工。謝謝她
2：添加了禮賓管家羅傑的微信後，羅傑的服務態度沒得説。很棒很棒，加上又是三亞老鄉，又熱情好客，是個積極陽光的小夥。説話很有禮貌，讓人覺得很有親切感。海口希爾頓酒店有這樣的兩位員工，值得被表揚。下次有機會來海口，海口希爾頓酒店必選之一。

入住當天下午斷斷續續的下雨，出門不方便，羅傑管家貼心地給我申請了行政酒廊的下午茶，還有第二天的早餐。羅傑也給我叮囑了一些細節，像怎麼換乘電梯等等，讓我在希爾頓的這一天體驗感很好，下次有機會還想來！

這是一家對員工培訓很好的酒店，也因為一家酒店，全家對第一次來的城市印象很好。下次到海口還會入住。

msg:【太長不看版】
總結：住海口希爾頓在地下停車場的經歷一次直接毀掉我們這一週對海南積累的良好印象和體驗。
1、換房間送洗衣液等服務溝通算比較順利，酒店基操過關；
2、不知哪個明星入住酒店，大量粉絲/私生堵住電梯到地下停車場的通道，影響住客正常出行；
3、酒店地下停車場管理混亂，車主素質參差不齊，有直接堵住通道停的，有在非劃線停車位置停的；
4、在避讓這些違停車的過程中，我們的車在轉彎時剮蹭到了轉彎處的立柱，立柱上方卡住車門裡；酒店停車場管理方和物業互相推諉，打12345和報警也沒有實質進展，着急趕飛機我們懶得繼續理論了。

【詳情版】
我們在海南待了一週整體體驗都不錯，尤其陵水的某豪，離開時戀戀不捨，如果不是後面行程已經安排好了非常想多住幾天；最後一晚定在海口希爾頓，想好好休息一下第二天趕飛機，結果直接毀掉了這一週對海南的良好印象和體驗。
1、房間氣味與噪音
我們到的時間比較晚，原定的套房沒有了，説給升到一室一廳套房，在21樓，進入後感覺房間設施一般，櫃子門框等細節處有年代感，這個還算能理解，畢竟酒店比較有年頭了；但房間裏瀰漫著令人不適的奇怪氣味，聞久了頭暈；間歇性地能聽到高頻的長音滴聲，猜測可能與設備間較近，根本沒法好好休息，於是溝通換房間；換房間溝通比較順利，給換到了22層的套房，沒有奇怪氣味，卧室內安靜。不過這並不是加分項；這種情況不給換房間才有問題；
2、房間電話
房間的電話沒有直撥前台的快捷鍵，需要先撥打客服中心再轉前台，但如果時間比較晚則客服中心無人接聽。不理解這個設定，為什麼不能方便住客一鍵撥打至前台，還是説需要住客仔細閲讀它電話上的長篇説明書才能夠拿到前台電話然後獲得基本服務？當時我們想洗衣服需要洗衣液，撥打客服中心無人接聽，衹好嘗試按了送餐服務，接通後請工作人員送一些洗衣液到房間，等待半個多小時未果，後來直接下到前台説了才送到；
3、令人無語的明星粉絲
臨近新年跨年舉辦大型活動，不知道哪個明星入住這個酒店，電梯出來前往地下停車場短短一段路蹲着許多粉絲/私生，正常住客難以通行，非常無語；
4、電梯裏遇到的工作人員
退房後我們拖着大箱子行李去地下停車場開車趕飛機，出電梯時，同在電梯裏的酒店工作人員沒有任何禮貌性地幫扶電梯門或按住開門鍵方便住客拖箱子出電梯，而是直接搶在住客前出了電梯。退了房的客人就不是客人了是吧？
5、地下停車場
地下停車場管理混亂，商場、辦公、酒店住客的車輛都在裏面；車主素質參差不齊，有直接堵住通道停的，有在非劃線停車位置停的；對於這些違停車輛，停車場管理人員表示他們衹能撥打12345獲得車主電話請車主挪車。那請問要停車場管理人員幹嘛？反正都隨便停，堵住的時候打電話就好了。
6、在避讓這些違停車的過程中，我們的車在轉彎時剮蹭到了轉彎處的立柱，立柱上方卡住車門裡，留下深深的劃痕；酒店地下停車場管理方和物業方互相推諉，打12345和報警也沒有實質進展，着急趕飛機我們懶得繼續理論了。
可能海南不缺遊客，所以酒店不屑於做回頭客生意吧，總之這是一次非常失望的體驗。

msg:我第一次住希爾頓的酒店房間，價格不便宜，以為可以很好，結果像極了三星級酒店房間，入住僅僅24小時加一個晚上一個早上，我就趕緊退房了，房間裏共計消滅了三衹小蛾子和爬上枕頭的一衹小蟲子，因為太晚了也沒法換酒店了，就忍着睡了一夜，沒想到第二天一早胳膊就莫名的起了一片包，天還沒亮就趕緊退房走了，實在是用自己的慘痛經歷勸阻大家千萬別住希爾頓，管理和衞生堪憂，我都不敢想象那個枕頭上的小蟲子沒發現，萬一跑進人耳朵裏會怎樣……

最後説兩點，酒廊稍顯拉胯，雖然沒有去到歡樂時光不好評價，下午茶真的敷衍，且實際開放時間和房間手冊中的不符，但是酒廊服務態度還是很不錯。
床墊太軟不好睡，設施也稍顯老舊了。

msg:必須全五星好評的酒店！首先感謝前台小姐姐，很耐心地幫我協調房間，充分考慮客户需求，在海口住了兩家五星酒店，這家酒店的禮賓真的很到位，而且上電梯的時候指路也很好。

設施：保持希爾頓一貫的傳統，推薦住公寓式套房，因為空間很大，景觀很好

環境：環境很贊，特別喜歡希爾頓的床品，很nice

服務：服務不錯，就是忘記問前台小姐姐名字了很遺憾。

管家Gary服務非常滿意，提前安排好了房間，入住期間先安排了用餐！續住價格實惠划算！早上樓下爆水管正洗頭呢停水了，晚上洗漱淋浴間不下水，浴缸沖洗又漏水。師傅來修還一去不復返！等了半小時找零件！如果沒有管家的話，我真的要給一星差評了！
衞生很差，設施老化，客房服務全靠催，早餐一般。
唯一的優點就是管家服務好，衷心希望管家跳槽吧，這家酒店太差了不利於職業發展！

因為行程安排有調整，酒店給我免費取消了原訂單，朋友提前退房，酒店也免收了後面一天的房費，這真的太讚了（按照攜程的政策是不能免費取消或退訂的）。
重新預訂入住後，酒店給免費升級到了52層的房間，送了歡迎水果，房間有無敵景觀，而且非常安靜。
客房服務也很給力，我們打電話想讓多送幾瓶水，結果直接給來了一提！
前台人員也很專業，鄭重感謝一下王雅楠Grace，服務熱情、周到、專業，五星好評！

唯一缺點熱水供應不上，因樓層較高吧，個別被子有一點點臟。

停車場沒有空位置，打電話給攜程上的酒店客服，打了四次，兩次不通，一次通了，一次還掛我電話，對哦，就是電話拿起來掛掉那種。我頓時就覺得超級不愉快了。衹能兜來兜去找停車位。連個酒店專屬停車位都沒有感覺好low.

然後期間各種覺得這裏的服務員沒有服務意識。缺少培訓。在三亞灣的瑞吉過來的在這裏感到非常大的落差。

前幾天在海口的威斯汀住的服務態度比這裏好多了。

msg:沒想到的“差”！

原來出差住過幾次，硬件還行，所以這次春節也住這，沒想到餐飲服務一塌糊塗！糟透了！從沒有在一個五星級酒店體驗到如此差的餐飲！

1、送餐服務，在微信上點完之後毫無反應，再打電話去就説好好好，然後又得不斷聯繫確認才送來（更不必提期間客服電話經常無人接聽）
2、好不容易送到房間的餐品，質量叫做那個差呀！比一個城鄉結合部路邊盒飯店的品質還差！真是完全超出我的想象：不是好不好吃的問題，而是食材像是全部是假的！真是佩服他們不知是從哪搞來的這些東西。
3、自助早餐：沒有一樣的味道是對的，同樣，根本還輪不到説好吃不好吃的問題，有怪味！令人瞠目結舌的是甚至連一個簡單的煎雞蛋都有一股鹹鹹的怪味！

這個希爾頓酒店的餐飲服務與食品質量已經不是一個簡單的好不好的問題，已經到了匪夷所思的地步，無法理解與想象這些“東西”都是如何“做”出來的……更無法理解與想象這背後的“製作人”都是怎麼回事……

從我進入酒店門口那刻，就感受到了酒店的服務熱情，門口小哥哥貼心詢問入住房型，順利引導我至酒店前台辦理入住；前台小姐姐人美又熱情，快速幫我辦理好入住手續；
酒店房間設施保養不錯，乾淨衞生；去海口國際免税店的話需要提前一天小程序預約（前台有預約碼）；忘記預約的也沒關係，可以去上車地點看一下是否有位置，空的話可以直接上車。
總之這次的海口之旅雖然天氣不作美，但是整個入住體驗非常棒，下次來還會選擇海口希爾頓。

msg:AidamWeng管家超級好評！辦理入住的時候幫忙升級，後續入住期間也很舒服，聽説需要口罩生病了細心問是否需要紅糖薑茶，得知為喉嚨不舒服後安排了水果。服務太周到了！後續會繼續住這家酒店的。不過房間的廁所不知道怎麼設計的，味道很大也不通風，有一股消不掉的臭味。

msg:這是我這次在海口住的第四家旅館，也是硬件最好的一家，當然也是最貴的一家。首先是位置好。其次是風景好，第三交通便利。
服務很好，尤其是打掃房間的，因為我住了十四天，就不一一點名了，遇到的和沒遇到過的都很好。
