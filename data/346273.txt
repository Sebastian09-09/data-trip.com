On a separate matter, the shower basin was leaking. I had to use the robe to absorb water leaked from the shower basin.

msg:I chose this place for my business trip, thinking that it was convenient in the city center. However, the hotel was very disappointing in such a good location and an old five-star hotel! I canceled the reservation after two days and changed to another hotel.
When we arrived, it was already past eight o'clock in the evening. After checking in, the elevator said that they were repairing the surveillance camera, and the electric drill was very loud. Then I went to the bathroom and found that the bathtub was leaking. The staff came and wiped it and asked if they wanted to ask the maintenance worker to fix it the next day. It felt very bad after checking in late at night.
The next day, someone came to repair the interface, and left after the repair. There was no cleaning staff to clean up, making the bathroom very messy. After complaining, the lobby manager on duty responded quickly and apologized. Not long after that, when I turned on the faucet, the faucet on the hot water side fell off directly. Alas, I was too lazy to call for maintenance.
I just want to say that such an old five-star hotel, how can the supporting facilities be so old, except for the good location, there is really nothing good.

There were some minor problems in the restaurant at the beginning, but they were handled in time after communication, and the attitude was very good. The hotel is in the city center, and it is very convenient to travel. It only takes ten minutes to take a taxi to the high-speed rail station. There is a subway entrance just a few steps downstairs. The bedding is comfortable and clean. Although I can't see the sea view, it feels very warm. Special praise for the two duty managers, good service, good attitude and very professional in handling problems. If I come to Xiamen next time, I will definitely choose Hilton again.

msg:It was my first time to stay at the Xiamen Hilton Hotel, and overall it was very good. The front desk gave me warm water when I checked in, which I really needed as I was blown away by the sea breeze in Xiamen! ! The Chris**as a**osphere in Panji has been very strong and a**ospheric recently. The front desk specially arranged one of their garden view rooms. Although it is bright across the street, the view is not bad, and the room service is also very timely. The hotel is conveniently located, connected to a shopping mall, and has many dining and shopping options. I will choose this again when I come to Xiamen.

The concierge guys and the girls at the front desk are also very enthusiastic. You can see a smile on everyone's face. I also want to praise the girls who have the switchboard for actively solving my problem... The Chris**as tree in the lobby is so cute~ It brings the Chris**as a**osphere right now [baring teeth], the hotel breakfast is also good, 🥐 so delicious~ It’s great. This is my first choice when visiting Xiamen…

The bus station is right opposite the hotel. It's super, super, super convenient. And the location of the hotel is so good in the surrounding area. After eating, I went out for late-night snacks every day. It was so cool. The room was also clean, tidy, and smelled good. The staff were also very nice and gentle. Especially the lady who answered the phone was so gentle. The weather was a bit cold, otherwise I would have loved to go. I did some cooking in the outdoor garden but took cakes and coffee back to the room. The cakes were delicious! ! It seems to be called Floating Cloud Napoleon? The little bear leaning against the Chris**as tree is so cute. Hahaha. Accommodation is the most important thing when you go out to play. I made the right choice this time. I am very satisfied!

Taxi rides to several attractions were very quick. Later, it took 20 minutes to take a taxi to the airport. The concierge also helped with luggage and was always smiling and very friendly.

msg:Advantages: 1. The location is good, right in the Panji Center. Rich women who want to shop for luxury goods can save their worries and troubles. 2. The sound insulation of the room is pretty good. 3. Hygiene is quite clean. 4. Disposable cotton slippers are okay and very comfortable to wear. 5. The attitude and quality of the service staff are good.
Disadvantages: 1. The facilities and equipment, especially the sofa by the window, are too old! ! When I sit on it, I feel like it has a graphic feel. Anyway, it is mainly designed to be stain-resistant, but it is really old, rustic and ugly. 2. The recording channel 9 in the center of the TV has a very low sound even when turned on to the maximum. Other channels are normal. 3. TV sets are also very old. Nowadays, any TV set in the private room of any newly opened foot massage shop can be sold instantly. Some channels even have snowflake spots and Moss patterns on the screen. 4. The toiletries, especially the toothbrush, have a strong cheap smell, just like a 158-a-day express hotel. 5. The bathrobe is almost rotten and you haven’t changed it yet. The corners are tasseled. This is a bit unreasonable. Friends, can you believe that this is a bathrobe from a five-star hotel? 6. The toiletries are all welded on the wall, and I don’t intend for you to take them away. They are too expensive and of poor quality. The shower gel smells of cheap fragrance and I dare not use the shampoo for fear of **. 7. The telephone and kettle are very old, and traces of dust can be seen in the seams and seams. 8. If the customer doesn’t use the shoe polishing cloth, they probably haven’t changed it yet. Then pay attention to it. It has turned into a small gray cloth. It’s really ugly. 9. I went to the Ctrip platform again to confirm that I had indeed paid more than 700 yuan! Wouldn't it be better for me to stay in a hotel in another location for this money? Even if I want to visit Panji, I can take a taxi for 30 yuan round trip. Would I have paid this if I didn't think it was a five-star hotel? ? My money didn’t come from lottery tickets either! Is this the high-end and authentic Hilton that I remember? I feel like I'm staying in a Dunerxi.

As soon as I got off the bus, there was a bellman who helped me open the door and unload my luggage. I followed the guidance and came to the front desk where I checked in. I had just arrived at the front desk. A young man (Tom) said hello to me: Sir, please give me a bottle of water, and then handed me a bottle of water. His tone was very polite and enthusiastic. I saw that the little girl next to me also gave water to the guests. I was thinking, This was a good idea, although I didn’t drink it; because I didn’t sleep very well, he helped me choose a room with a better location on a high floor. I checked in in a while, and the little brother gave me a souvenir from the hotel. , and also gave me two drink coupons, saying that I could go to the lobby bar on the fifth floor to drink some free drinks with the coupons. Maybe because I was too tired, I didn’t want to move after I went back to the room and took a shower. I woke up in the early hours of the morning. It was past 1 o'clock, so I tried the souvenir given when I checked in. The biscuits in the small jar were pretty good, but the others were average. I checked out early the next day. I originally wanted to have breakfast. I looked online and felt that the breakfast should be pretty good. If I have a chance next time, I will definitely try it. Finally, the overall stay this time was pretty good. Although the hotel is a bit old, the service is really good. I think this is the highlight. I still remember the last time I stayed at the Xiamen Waldorf Astoria, I felt it was not that good. The price was so expensive and the service It's really not that good. When checking in at the front desk, it felt like I owed him a lot of money, with no expression...

The hotel is in the famous shopping mall, and there is a supermarket on the first floor, so it is very convenient to buy some things! The most important thing is that I left my watch at the hotel when I left. Later, the hotel called and said they would send it to me. Thank you very much!

Many reviews say that the breakfast is excellent, but I'm afraid I have never had an excellent breakfast. Breakfast is four stars. Why do you have the nerve to charge 16 service fees?
The toilet is not even at the all-season level, and the bedding and pillows are not even up to five-star standards. The TV is old and has snowflakes, so it cannot cast the screen. Bathing and toothbrushing are even worse, two and a half stars.

The Hilton brand is trustworthy, the hardware is in place, and the transportation is really good in Siming District! Floor management and swimming pool are very good. At the beginning, we only booked 2 nights, but later we considered staying for 4 nights. Except that there is no soap in the room, they are very thoughtful, suitable for taking a baby on vacation. The distance from the hotel to the scenic spots is good. It can be reached in 20 minutes by car. Bottled water and drinks are available. The dim sum in the Chinese restaurant was unexpectedly delicious. After waiting for a long time, I returned the western point, which is thoughtful! Before I left, I forgot my watch on the early flight. Thanks to the concierge Dai Sisi, the beautiful lady SF Express delivered it home. I received it the next day when I got home. Thanks!

msg:Very bad, must be protected from lightning😢
Originally it was said that it was relatively close to the city and the location was good. The whole trip was a poor experience.
1. When checking in, the one who arrived at 3 o'clock said there was no room and asked what to do. The receptionist's attitude was very bad, saying that the previous guest left late and didn't clean it well. Then I pressed my temper and asked how long it would take. The answer was that I didn't know, so give me a call. I got a call at around 5pm and said that I could check in.
2. When it came to luggage storage, although I was very tired, I could only ask for a place to stay. I asked if there was a place to store our luggage. They pointed us to a place, just a table, without saying that we would not help with our luggage. . We packed a total of two paper bags with clothes in them. When we came back to pick up our luggage, the bags were overturned and the clothes were all on the floor. This thing was obviously done casually, but the hotel staff had no sense of service.
3. The room hotel is in a shopping mall, with people coming and going, and the security is a bit questionable. Moreover, the room is very old, has nothing, and is very stuffy. The charging cable is in the middle of the bedside, and there is a sizzling sound of electricity when charging the mobile phone. The ventilation in the room is very poor and you will be out of breath.

Xiamen is beautiful. Don’t trust this hotel because of its brand. I once wondered if I was staying in a pirated version. This is the worst hotel I have stayed in in Xiamen. The hardware of the township guest house is the price of the star hotel.

Because the check-in requires a non-smoking room, the non-smoking room on the 7th floor is equivalent to a smoking room, and there is a strong smell of smoke when you enter the door. The hotel did not handle the smell of smoke well The guest in front still smoked inside. (Here I appeal to everyone, since it is a non-smoking room, don’t smoke in it.) After communication, we directly changed to the one on the 12th floor. Yes, this time it is a real non-smoking room. Because it is I was traveling alone, so I kept ordering takeaways at night. The lady at the concierge repeatedly confirmed that they belonged to me. (Because it wrote male) On the contrary, it made me feel very safe.

Although the old standard international chain has been around for a long time, it can be seen that the daily maintenance is intentional and the condition is not bad. The room was also very clean. When you check in, the front desk will communicate with you very enthusiastically, which makes you feel very relaxed, not that kind of rigid interaction. Talking about the impact of the epidemic, I took the initiative to remind the location of the nucleic acid test (it’s just outside the hotel, which is great 👍) I lost my room card after drinking too much that night. The water is a small thing that surprises me, but I can feel that Hilton's management is in place. I was in a hurry for breakfast. After looking at it, it was very rich and down-to-earth. I ate a bowl of sand tea noodles and steamed meat buns. It's full of energy, but the restaurant space is a little smaller. The occupancy rate may be good in these two days, and there are a lot of people. Overall, I am very satisfied. I will still choose it next time I return to Xiamen.

The key is to take the children to see the sights. So it is more convenient to live in the city center. I did a lot of comparisons. First of all, the location is convenient for travel. The transportation is convenient and the food is also convenient. Now, a condition has been added, which is the convenience of making nucleic acids. Also the area should not be too small. I like the bright style. It was renovated in 2019, so the decoration can be done. Hygiene can also. I have sensitive skin, and if there is a problem with the sheets, I get itchy all over.

I only found out because I went to shower late, so I had to report to the front desk the next morning. I asked the master arranger to wait for us to go out for repairs at around 9 o'clock. Because Xiamen is too hot, I got sweaty when I went out to play. After returning to the hotel room at noon, I was ready to take a shower and get myself water. It turned out that the shower was not ready yet. Who knew that the front desk told me that the master was rushing over on the way. This is the service of a five-star hotel. The front desk also told me that there was no room to change, which meant that I was soaked in water and had to wait for the hotel master to rush over and repair it before I could shower. The front desk staff should be convenient Ability to be improved. Fortunately, the hotel manager helped solve the problem in time after knowing it. It is suggested that the hotel should regularly check the hardware and facilities of the room to avoid similar problems and enhance the service level of the front desk.

The duty manager Ken and the front desk Catherine are very enthusiastic. It feels like meeting a good friend. They are very cordial and feel at home! The artwork in the hotel lobby is beautiful, and there are contactless robots delivering takeaways. Not a new hotel but clean and hygienic. It is worth recommending. When you come to Xiamen, you must choose the Hilton Paragon Hotel.

My room was upgraded to a bigger one for free. , The hygiene is very good, but the shower in the bathroom is not dripping, and the small water force is very strong. I can't stand the tingling feeling, so I want to change the shower, but the shower is probably broken, and there is no water coming out. The breakfast is richer, so I feel a lot more comfortable, but it would be better if the restaurant service was more diligent, such as clearing up the dishes that the guests do not use.

The front desk staff of the hotel are still very enthusiastic. They will hand over a bottle of water when they check in, which is very warm. Catch up on the weekend and ate a buffet directly at the hotel with friends. It seems that many hotels only open buffets on weekends, so there are quite a lot of people. The price is very favorable, 98 per person, there are a lot of things, home-cooked food is the main thing and it is very popular with locals. Anyway, I was very full and the food was delicious. When I left, I bought a Hilton doll. This is like the fat tiger in Doraemon? Anyway, the kids like it. In the future, when I come to Xiamen, I will choose the Paragon Hilton Hotel again.

It was raining in Xiamen during the Spring Festival, and there was not much going out to eat, drink, and have fun. The family experienced Hokkien cuisine in the Chinese restaurant of the hotel. The price is very high, the local taste is also very popular with the family. Listening to the waiters can greet you warmly and call some guests by name, there should be a lot of repeat customers. As a five-star hotel, the variety and quality of Chinese food are not inferior to those of famous restaurants. Our family ate dinner at the hotel for 2 days. Vinegar meat is the favorite of children.

The hotel is an old international five-star hotel, but the maintenance of the equipment is still very good. The key point is to talk about the convenience. The hotel is in the real city center, the subway is directly connected to the hotel, and the hotel is also connected to high-end shopping malls. Restaurants and cinemas have everything. At the same time, the subway can also lead to various business district scenic spots like Mixc City, SM City Plaza, Zhongshan Road Commercial Street, and Gulangyu Port. You can take the subway directly from the hotel, and it only takes 34 stops. It is quite convenient. Also, Xiamen's subway is newly built, the environment is particularly good, clean and comfortable. During the Chinese New Year, I plan to bring my family to Xiamen for a good trip. Excellent hotel [strong][strong][strong]

When I checked out, I was negligent and left a jade pendant. I called and said that I couldn't find it, so I could only swallow it. I searched and sorted my luggage today, and found that a crystal deer ornament was not taken with me when I checked out. However, when I repeatedly asked about the jade pendant, I did not inform that although there was no jade pendant, there was still a deer. It can be seen that what is lost must be occupied by people. It's my fault for being careless, but it's the hotel management's fault for picking things up. Very bad mood.

In particular, the hotel’s breakfast is very local, and it just satisfies my nostalgic thoughts. Shacha noodles and peanut soup are very authentic. Other five-star regular hotels have more complete breakfast products. But I still love local flavors the most. The restaurant manager will also take the initiative to ask about the dining experience.
Overall, it is worth recommending. Although the hotel has a year, it is very grounded. The corporate culture is well maintained. The staff makes people feel warm!

As a five-star hotel, it is a bit too much, and the soundproofing is not good. Forget it, most hotels have average soundproofing , Mainly because it feels like someone knocks on the door in the middle of the night. Also, there is no night light.

msg:After moving in for an hour, I suddenly wanted to drink a bottle of ice-cola. Oh, the MINI bar is empty and there is nothing. It is recommended that since there is nothing, turn off the refrigerator and waste electricity (Can Hilton not afford drinks? I'll still send it at my own expense. You have to provide these!)! At this time, think about it and go to sleep. As a result, the air conditioner can't keep up with the cooling speed, causing it to be cold without the quilt, and hot when the quilt is covered. This feeling is generally in the air conditioner that cannot keep up with the wind speed. That's it. You should understand. At this time, the phone is out of power, because there is no hand in, but fortunately there is a base that can be directly plugged in. However, this base has poor contact, and there is no response at a time. My mobile phone is also constantly banging. A very poor experience, not as good as the three or four hundred outside.

整體感覺都很舊 水龍頭超級難用
房間有發黴的味道 隔音也不好
電視機是雪花牌的 跟前台説來看一下竟然要打兩次電話才有人來 然後説是電視轉播 整間酒店的電視都是這樣的。。
冰箱製冷不太行 酸奶放一晚上第二天拿出來竟然是温的 都壞了衹能扔掉

服務：在我入住前一天酒店的前廳工作人員給我打電話，問了我的喜好，這本是很好的舉措，理解你們希望通過這樣的方式要好評，我也能接受。但是第二天我到酒店辦入住時，所有的問題都要再問我一次，注意，我説的是問不是確認。如果你們交接班了，我的問題我的要求，你跟我確認就可以了。給我的感覺就是前一天電話問了白問，這就屬於浪費我時間跟騷擾了。

msg:暑假裏去的，帶了長者和小孩
首選還是位置方便的酒店
就選到了磐基希爾頓

酒店直接就在磐基中心
地下直通地鐵
叫車也很方便
鬧中取靜

磐基中心裏吃飯選擇也多
還有超市 咖啡 奶茶

驚喜的是酒店有連通房
在攜程上就能直接和酒店聯繫
溝通確定後，就幫我安排好了
特別方便

早餐真的太讓人驚艷了
尤其是烘培的 特別好吃
還有各種廈門當地小吃

酒店的游泳池很棒 露天的
白天晚上人都不算太多
娃們很喜歡去游泳

房間設施稍微有點舊
但還是很乾凈 
以及因為時間舊了
可以看到有些硬件進行了更換
就和原來的裝修風格不一樣了

酒店在繁華商業街，但是大堂和商場餐廳在一起，人來人往，秩序混亂，坐電梯還能遇到酒蒙子。
設施設備中規中矩。
開始本來可以給個好的評價。
但是，第二天遇到的服務員辦事相互推諉，銷售人員電話不接，找人不回訊息，連蒙帶騙極度不負責任。
客觀點説吧，去除人為因素，可以給個90分。

When I entered the lobby, I could smell the aroma I liked. I felt very comfortable. The girl at the front desk took the initiative to greet me to check in, with a sweet smile. Check in Everything went well, and I was very satisfied with the breakfast the next day. There are many choices, and the quality of the staff is very high. I feel the most satisfied is the meat swallow~ It is really delicious. I will still choose this place next time when I am on a business trip or traveling to Xiamen. This hotel not only has convenient transportation, but also has a great service attitude, making you feel at home!

下午四點多到店辦理入住告訴我房間還沒清潔好，想到行政房是可以延到三點退房也是可以理解，但是我急着赴約，後來就要了非無煙房先入住了，一進房煙味有點重。
房間不算大，所謂硬床墊好像是加墊了一塊木板在鋪上薄床墊，睡起來確實夠硬睡得很習慣，可以提供乳膠枕，浴室水壓有點小，噴頭用了加壓噴頭但是用起來不舒服，噴頭把手鬆動，用水時會跑動，早餐種類不少，食材不錯，服務員態度好，浴室燈光不錯自拍好看。
