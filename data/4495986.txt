msg:I needed peace, quiet and a proper nights sleep. I got the peace and quiet, but not the sleep because the bed is very hard. This place is beautiful. The room is spacious and beautiful too. It’s not foreigner friendly though… the staff don’t speak any English, the menus and everything is in Chinese. The staff did help me get breakfast as room service though because I was too late to physically go for breakfast. I really appreciated that. There’s also plenty of amenities you can use which I didn’t. But I’ll definitely go back because it’s the quietest hotel I’ve experienced in Beijing thus far and that’s the reason I do my solo hotel trips. Hopefully next time they can give a softer bed and have a bilingual menu.

The room was upgraded for free, and there is a small train to ride. Special thanks.
There are two options for breakfast, Chinese and Western, and the quantity is also sufficient.
Not far from the city, the environment is good, and it is suitable for weekend trips. Recommended!

msg:Very satisfied. The garden is beautiful. The service is especially good. Basically every service staff is very enthusiastic. The dining experience in the restaurant is good. There are not many people dining, but the service is still in place. Maybe because there are not many people dining, the breakfast is not a buffet. The restaurant arranges Chinese and Western food, with a rich variety, and basically can't finish it. The breakfast varieties are different for two days, and there are changes. It is very sincere. Looking forward to it again. By the way, I saw the heated swimming pool and it feels good. I didn't bring equipment this time. But the garden is very suitable for running. It is a good place to relax and vacation.

After I actually went there, I felt it was pretty good, the place was big, there were many activities, but the downsides were: the entertainment projects closed too early, basically closed at 8pm; the shuttle bus arrangement was not detailed enough, or the instructions were not in place; there was no park map, and the address instructions for the entertainment projects were not clear enough (especially the golf project); the last one was the price of the entertainment projects was a bit high, of course it could also be that I was too poor 😂

msg:One of the worst hotels I have ever stayed in. The experience was extremely poor. Especially the old man at the door had a very bad attitude and no service at all. The quality of an old farmer outside the Sixth Ring Road was clearly reflected. He used swear words and didn't care whether he should be taken care of or not. The ones who should be in charge are careless and making things difficult. I want to ask if the hotel can't find anyone. They want anyone. Why don't they take assessments? What I do with a salary of 4,000 is not personnel. The hotel facilities are old and there is a strong smell. A strong musty smell hit my nose. It looked like no one had lived in it for a long time. It was so bad that I didn’t know where I got the confidence to still be in business. I felt very good about myself. It was about to be eliminated and it was almost turning into an antique! One of the worst hotels, you can feel it from the doorman at the south gate!

msg:I never write a bad review, but I really have to write a bad review this time! I went with two friends and their children. I originally thought it would be a family weekend, but this hotel overturned my perception of hotels!
The person who checked in at the front desk was very apathetic. The room was on the third floor and there was no elevator. They did not help with luggage. There was a musty smell when entering the room. The facilities were very old. It was like staying in a guest house in the 1980s. The sofas were all It's stains. The air conditioner doesn't even have an adjus**ent button and blows directly onto the bed. There's no hair dryer in the bathroom, just two toothbrushes and nothing else. I asked for disposable slippers for ten yuan a pair (why don't you go grab the money)? Not to mention the breakfast was terrible, flies were flying everywhere in the restaurant. The next day after we came back, my children and I both had colds and fevers. The sanitation of this hotel was really bad, which completely subverted my understanding of hotels! Apart from free swimming, there is nothing else good. A hotel worth 1,000 yuan is not as good as a fast hotel.

雖然衹開放了一間餐廳，但是吃了幾天也不膩。大廚的水平確實不錯，鹹淡合適、味道很足。服務也很周到。餐廳裏還備有閲讀書目，供孩子們在等餐時閲覽。價格上也屬於正常水平。
這次住了白宮酒店行政套房。房間面積很大，設施雖然因時間長略顯老舊，但並無實際影響。有歡迎水果，早餐也在自助餐外另外提供了特別好餐食，算是彌補了不足。
總體來説，是放鬆型休假的好地方。不吵不鬧（即使遇到有人辦婚禮，也完全不影響普通遊客），易於親近自然、放緩節奏，值得N刷。

msg:因為兒子參加斯巴達，為了方便參賽，賽後有地方洗澡，才提前過來的，説實話真的挺貴又不值得。房間很大，進門是沙發茶几，還有電視，裡邊是卧室，也不小，但床不大，也不舒適，設施老舊，廁所門關不上，有浴缸，但説實話不知道是因為舊還是什麼，看上去很臟。以上是住宿。莊園環境還可以，人也不多，衹適合溜達遛彎，沒啥項目。熱氣球衹給會員，好像有觀光車？我們業沒注意，吃的業非常不行，要是過週末，不建議去。

msg:It is the hotel with the worst sense of stay. I ordered a suite, the bathroom has both a shower and a bathtub, but the bathtub only has a faucet without a shower, and the shower room only has a fixed oversized shower head on the head, no hand-held ones! You can't bathe your baby at all! And the adults take a bath in the shower room, the door can't be closed tightly, while closing it, there is a gap of about 6cm on the other side. The bathroom is not air-conditioned, but the temperature is low, there is a big gap, and the bath is still leaking! Only plastic slippers are provided in the room. Disposable slippers need to be purchased. Although it is environmentally friendly, plastic slippers are completely stinky, which is the disgusting smell of water! One of the square towels still has black stains and has not been cleaned. Who dares to use it? ? ! ! The carpet in the room slightly closer to the wall is all gray! The hot water that is boiled is all hydroalkali. My daughter said "what's the smell of it" after a sip! If the child hadn't competed nearby the next day, he would have left that night!
