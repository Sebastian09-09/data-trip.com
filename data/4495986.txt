msg:I needed peace, quiet and a proper nights sleep. I got the peace and quiet, but not the sleep because the bed is very hard. This place is beautiful. The room is spacious and beautiful too. It‚Äôs not foreigner friendly though‚Ä¶ the staff don‚Äôt speak any English, the menus and everything is in Chinese. The staff did help me get breakfast as room service though because I was too late to physically go for breakfast. I really appreciated that. There‚Äôs also plenty of amenities you can use which I didn‚Äôt. But I‚Äôll definitely go back because it‚Äôs the quietest hotel I‚Äôve experienced in Beijing thus far and that‚Äôs the reason I do my solo hotel trips. Hopefully next time they can give a softer bed and have a bilingual menu.

msg:The manor is so big, and it's full of green. I made an appoin**ent with my children's classmates to get together on the weekend and stay in the manor for one night. It is especially suitable for children to ride bicycles and outdoor activities.
The room was upgraded for free, and there is a small train to ride. Special thanks.
There are two options for breakfast, Chinese and Western, and the quantity is also sufficient.
Not far from the city, the environment is good, and it is suitable for weekend trips. Recommended!

The attitude of the service staff is OK, but they lack training, and they are very slow to get things. The room supplies are not fully equipped.
A staff member helped us adjust the TV, thank you!

msg:Very satisfied. The garden is beautiful. The service is especially good. Basically every service staff is very enthusiastic. The dining experience in the restaurant is good. There are not many people dining, but the service is still in place. Maybe because there are not many people dining, the breakfast is not a buffet. The restaurant arranges Chinese and Western food, with a rich variety, and basically can't finish it. The breakfast varieties are different for two days, and there are changes. It is very sincere. Looking forward to it again. By the way, I saw the heated swimming pool and it feels good. I didn't bring equipment this time. But the garden is very suitable for running. It is a good place to relax and vacation.

It would be better to open more leisure areas for guests staying in the hotel

There are European-style buildings and Jiangnan gardens. During the May Day holiday, there was also a small animal exhibition. The children happily fed the alpacas that were more than half a year old and the cute little rabbits. Perfect three days and two nights.

After I actually went there, I felt it was pretty good, the place was big, there were many activities, but the downsides were: the entertainment projects closed too early, basically closed at 8pm; the shuttle bus arrangement was not detailed enough, or the instructions were not in place; there was no park map, and the address instructions for the entertainment projects were not clear enough (especially the golf project); the last one was the price of the entertainment projects was a bit high, of course it could also be that I was too poor üòÇ

The drawback is that the dishes in the restaurant are few and expensive. There are very few people in the swimming pool, the water quality is good, and the overall price/performance ratio is very high.

msg:One of the worst hotels I have ever stayed in. The experience was extremely poor. Especially the old man at the door had a very bad attitude and no service at all. The quality of an old farmer outside the Sixth Ring Road was clearly reflected. He used swear words and didn't care whether he should be taken care of or not. The ones who should be in charge are careless and making things difficult. I want to ask if the hotel can't find anyone. They want anyone. Why don't they take assessments? What I do with a salary of 4,000 is not personnel. The hotel facilities are old and there is a strong smell. A strong musty smell hit my nose. It looked like no one had lived in it for a long time. It was so bad that I didn‚Äôt know where I got the confidence to still be in business. I felt very good about myself. It was about to be eliminated and it was almost turning into an antique! One of the worst hotels, you can feel it from the doorman at the south gate!

msg:I never write a bad review, but I really have to write a bad review this time! I went with two friends and their children. I originally thought it would be a family weekend, but this hotel overturned my perception of hotels!
The person who checked in at the front desk was very apathetic. The room was on the third floor and there was no elevator. They did not help with luggage. There was a musty smell when entering the room. The facilities were very old. It was like staying in a guest house in the 1980s. The sofas were all It's stains. The air conditioner doesn't even have an adjus**ent button and blows directly onto the bed. There's no hair dryer in the bathroom, just two toothbrushes and nothing else. I asked for disposable slippers for ten yuan a pair (why don't you go grab the money)? Not to mention the breakfast was terrible, flies were flying everywhere in the restaurant. The next day after we came back, my children and I both had colds and fevers. The sanitation of this hotel was really bad, which completely subverted my understanding of hotels! Apart from free swimming, there is nothing else good. A hotel worth 1,000 yuan is not as good as a fast hotel.

msg:It is the hotel with the worst sense of stay. I ordered a suite, the bathroom has both a shower and a bathtub, but the bathtub only has a faucet without a shower, and the shower room only has a fixed oversized shower head on the head, no hand-held ones! You can't bathe your baby at all! And the adults take a bath in the shower room, the door can't be closed tightly, while closing it, there is a gap of about 6cm on the other side. The bathroom is not air-conditioned, but the temperature is low, there is a big gap, and the bath is still leaking! Only plastic slippers are provided in the room. Disposable slippers need to be purchased. Although it is environmentally friendly, plastic slippers are completely stinky, which is the disgusting smell of water! One of the square towels still has black stains and has not been cleaned. Who dares to use it? ? ! ! The carpet in the room slightly closer to the wall is all gray! The hot water that is boiled is all hydroalkali. My daughter said "what's the smell of it" after a sip! If the child hadn't competed nearby the next day, he would have left that night!
