msg:Grand Hyatt Sanya Haitang Bay
Some few keys I’d like to pinpoint during my stay in this resort. We were staying for 5 nights, from June 1st to 8th. 

CLEANLINESS 
I’m very surprised with the cleanliness in the room and surrounding areas. Walking through the lobby, garden areas, pool areas and of course the room. You’ll be able to see gardeners, housekeepers, and cleaners doing everything to clean the their areas. This resort is spotless. Five stars for that.

LOCATION 
Location is quite far from downtown but enough to go shopping around 68 market/mall. The hotel is connected to the mall where you can find and dine local restaurants. It is good when you’re trying to avoid the pricy meal at the resort. (Go local, get cheaper)
And yes, location from the airport is about 35-45 minutes away. No traffic on the way. But try to avoid some local drivers who’s trying to give you a cheaper price to send you to the hotel. Always check the price on Didi or other app. When using those apps there will be no compromise.

SERVICE
Service. Well, overall it was great! Starting from reception, we were greeted during the arrival with the help of our luggage and stuff and guided us through the lobby. The receptionist attended us during check-in was very attentive and helpful (I didn’t get a chance to check her name). She was very helpful, and even gave us a tour through the map and sent us to the lift to our room. 

The young man and young lady at the housekeeping dept. was always ready to help us with what we needed in the room and prepared a honeymoon decoration in the room on the first day with complementary champagne and a fruit basket (Downside: some are telling to give them five stars) but I totally understand as it helps them as well.

Restaurant staff are relatively friendly and helpful. Very welcoming when you coming for breakfast and guide us to our seats. BUT, you’ll need to come earlier than 9. Otherwise, you’ll be lining up outside the restaurant waiting for the vacant seat.

AMENITIES 
Amenities are well cleaned and new. Showers and tub are quite new and well maintained. Other things in the resort are basically great.
Swimming at the beach is on your own risk. No lifeguard assigned to watch as it is a public beach. Basically it’s not allowed to go swimming. Haitang bay resorts are all the same. If you’re looking for a resort where you can swim, you need to find somewhere else such as Yalong bay or Wuzhizhou Island.

Overall stay was great. 
Just bear in mind, if you’re looking for a hotel or resort for fun this resort is not for you. But if you’re looking for a relaxation and calm holiday this resort is for you. 
There are only few entertainment and experience you can have in the resort such as live music during barbecue dinner at the Grand Cafe, dinner in the sky, and show outside the restaurant.

msg:First day check-in was a bit tough as I arrived early in the morning. Room was ready 2 PM.

Room didn’t meet my “clean” expectation, so I had to ask for second round of cleaning. I understand it was busy weekend & so many guests to take care of.

For this part, Manager Davidson Dong was very helpful!
I got room cleaned around 7 PM and he helped me using the Club Lounge in the mean time.

Because the trip is for my birthday, the hotel also provided birthday cake & the rose bed.

Hotel gym was nice & spacious - but didn’t have smith machine. 

Beach seems like ‘not’ private exclusive beach - without sun bed - but public without lifeguard.

I could fly a drone at the beach, but not in the garden of the hotel - for guest privacy reasons.

Overall, it was an amazing experience here at Grand Hyatt.

Thank you.

All staff were very friendly and helpful. We tried the pool grill and the Chinese restaurant on site, both had very delicious food and wonderful service. Breakfast had a huge selection of both western and Chinese options and was also very well done.

msg:This trip we stayed at two different hotels. This has enabled me to write a better review as I have a good comparison. The Hyatt is smaller, feels very calm and tries to be dignified. They discourage food deliveries but there is a food mall right at the end of the driveway that has good options. We tried their high tea and dinner at the Chinese restaurant. For the price the food was not that great. The buildings were lovely but looked worn. The rooms smelled moldy. The service was not good. Housekeeping barely touched our room and did not replenish water and coffee. My friend tried to get hold of the front desk and was passed along or phones not picked up. The pools were nice in that there was plenty of shade. But the kids did not like them as they looked dark and were dirty. The beach was not clean. There was a lifeguard on duty at the beach which was good as those waters can be dangerous. What we enjoyed the most about this hotel was the delicious breakfast buffet and the strong coffee. We also enjoyed the calm. There is a kids area with activities. Most were already booked by the time we checked. And parents must stay with the kids.

The room service staff Xu Kunhong and Lin Youxin are also very good, and they are conscientious and responsible in their work. Especially when they saw that we used the bathtub the day before, they took the initiative to help us arrange a flower petal bubble bath the next day. The breakfast has a wide variety and the quality is ok, but there are not many executive courtesies. I hope it will be strengthened. Overall, the hotel is recommended.

First of all, the check-in process was very smooth. The front desk staff patiently answered my various questions and provided thoughtful help. After arriving at the hotel, the check-in procedures were also very fast, and the lobby decoration was very elegant.

The hotel's rooms are clean and tidy, and the facilities are also very complete. The staff's attentiveness can be felt from the details. What satisfies me most is the hotel's service attitude. No matter what needs are encountered, the front desk and other service staff will solve them in a very warm and thoughtful way, making people feel at home.
This stay at Grand Hyatt Haitang Bay is a very unforgettable accommodation experience. I will recommend it to my relatives and friends around me, and I hope I will have the opportunity to stay again in the future.

msg:Traveling in the off-season, the price-performance ratio is super high. The Grand Hyatt Hotel I stayed in this time was online in the off-season, and it did not fall behind due to the off-season. This is great! I have stayed in most of the hotels in Haitang Bay. The service is proportional to the price. The service in the peak season and off-season is very obvious. The price is of course a part of it. The service is reflected in some details. It is worth affirming to compare the Grand Hyatt. It seems that the nomination and praise of the butler is very formal and deliberate, but this time it comes from my heart to praise the butler Alex. Professionalism, professionalism, efficiency, and execution ability are very strong. He can solve all the requests, which is much better than some hotel butlers who are indifferent. At least it doesn’t feel so perfunctory. There is an evaluation standard for whether you can do things. The room will be arranged in advance before check-in. When we proposed to change the room, the butler Alex arranged it for me as soon as he got to work, and arranged a sea view room for me. The room introduction, the room is clean and tidy, the environment is very good, and during the stay, he will greet the needs every day, which is very thoughtful~~~ In short, the experience is very good!

It feels more welcoming than the year before last. The service attitude is super good. My butler Curry is really nice and reminds us very well. He even picked us up to go to the guest room when we arrived. I didn’t see anyone in Autograph the whole time.
The room at Grand Hyatt is really amazing. There is a free mini bar. There are many more swimming rings than the year before. Although it rained for the three days I stayed, I still took pictures when it was not raining. Even if you don’t swim, it’s nice to just stay in the room or soak your feet by the pool. There are just a lot of mosquitoes. You must use mosquito repellent.
The quality of the breakfast is good. Although there is not much, it tastes good.
The dinner at the VIP Club is filling. I like the skewers of dregs and vinegar. The main dishes for the two nights are different. There are still a lot of wines in the lounge. Although you can’t drink them, there are not many varieties of drinks. The coffee and tea are more abundant. The afternoon tea has fruits, nuts, potato chips, and two or three small cakes. Look at the sea view and eat some small desserts. It is special and comfortable.
If I have the chance, I will visit it three times!

I am particularly satisfied with the service of Grand Hyatt. I would like to thank Mr. David Ding, the duty manager of the front office, and Alex Xiaosu, the housekeeper of the room. They are not only good people but also handsome😀. The whole process is very considerate, very proactive and warm service, which makes our whole family feel at home! Even in the middle of the night, they worked overtime on WeChat to answer our questions and provide services for us, which was very touching! The hotel should really reward such employees. The lady who helped me check in was also very friendly (but I forgot her name in a hurry). In short, the staff of the entire hotel are very warm.

The hotel also has very complete supporting services, the executive lounge is also great, and there are performances by Cuban actors and small magic shows in the garden after dinner in the evening. I also like the performances in the lobby bar at night, and the holiday a**osphere is strong! There is also a children's playground and a small zoo, and the baby is super happy! The gym and swimming pool are also great! Anyway, everything is perfect!

msg:I have stayed in some Hyatt hotels in other cities before, and I feel that except for catering, which is its traditional strength, there is nothing special about it. However, this time, Grand Hyatt Haitang Bay gave me a big surprise.
First of all, although the room facilities can be seen to be old, they are still well maintained. The high-rise luxury sea view suite I stayed in overlooks the sea and sky, which is refreshing. On a hot day, I played in the water, drank tea, and was in a daze in the luxury pool room on the first floor. I temporarily put aside my busy work and felt very comfortable. The hotel public area is not small, and the coconut forest near the beach is quite photogenic. Like other hotels, the hotel also arranged a variety of parent-child activities. Although I brought the elderly here, it did not affect the elderly's fun. (^(エ)^)
Special thanks to the housekeeper Lynn. The day before check-in, she sent us the hotel's activities and tax-free discounts, and introduced the hotel facilities when we checked in, and assisted in solving various problems during our stay.

msg:Let me talk about the good aspects first:
1. The hotel environment is very good, the interior decoration is low-key and luxurious, and the suite area is super large.
2. The garden covers a large area, and there are all kinds of tropical fruit trees.
3. There are quite a lot of parent-child activities, and it is the first choice for families with children.
4. The sea in Haitang Bay is really beautiful, and the beach is relatively fine.
5. Whether the guests want to go to the beach or the swimming pool, the concierge's car can pick them up, which is very suitable for lazy people like me.
Next, let me talk about the personal dissatisfaction:
1. I booked a sea view suite. After checking in, I found that the toilet always had the kind of stench of a public toilet, a bit like the anti-odor of the floor drain, and it was not a little bit. I was too lazy to change rooms and wanted to try to solve it myself. After wiping the floor and the floor drain, I found that it was not very useful. The anti-odor was still serious.
2. At the same time, the air conditioning in this room does not feel very powerful, and I will sweat if I move a little.
3. After contacting the housekeeper first, I didn't get a reply from the housekeeper for 10 minutes. Maybe the housekeeper was busy at the time, so I could only call the front desk and give me feedback to spray air cleaner for me. I was a little speechless. Can the floor drain odor be solved by spraying air freshener? Or I took the initiative to ask the housekeeping staff to go upstairs to check. Later, the staff came to see that the air conditioning was fine, but the floor drain odor was still not solved.
After that, I took the initiative to go to the front desk to find the housekeeper. After the housekeeper found the manager on duty, he changed my room and upgraded it to a deluxe sea view suite. He also gave me 2 coconuts. Thank you, leader.
4. The coffee table of Haohai set has this kind of sharp corners, and there is a circle of metal edges at the bottom. If you don't pay attention, your legs will be scratched and swollen on the spot. It's really painful. Later, I told the housekeeper that a manager on duty contacted me that night and said he would help me protect the coffee table. I said I had rested and would do it the next day, but I didn't do it the next day. Maybe I was too busy to forget. Later, I contacted the housekeeper and came to install it. The picture was taken after I got home. If a child bumps into it, the consequences can be imagined.
5. I personally feel that the hotel service is inefficient, slow, and not proactive.

The lobby manager on duty saw that there were not enough people and took the initiative to drive the shuttle bus, which is much better than Shangri-La. The cleaning lady is very meticulous and enthusiastic. The hotel offers many activities, which is suitable for those who bring children but don't like noisy environments. Go-karting at your own expense is also very cheap, and the staff wearing hats are very considerate to take care of the children.

msg:The entire check-in process can be considered very pleasant, the service is very good, and the enthusiasm is not exaggerated. I have stayed in all the better hotels in Sanya. The Grand Hyatt and MGM offer the best service, but I would not recommend Yate.
The room is large, more than enough for me and my children, and I feel it is also very suitable for a family of three.
The breakfast is rich, both Chinese and Western, and the evening buffet also has a resident singer (you must see the performance in the cafe from 7:15 to 8:15 in the evening, it is very exciting). The bread and sausages in the poolside barbecue restaurant are delicious, and the service is very good. I ran out of the soda I ordered and gave me San Pellegrino instead. I borrowed the power bank and helped charge it. Thank you. The service lady at Yucun also opened coconut milk for the children and thoughtfully packed it into a box. Even those who paid 2,000 yuan for food have not enjoyed this trea**ent.
The battery car is always on call and the service is very good. There is a guy named Martin who is very enthusiastic and thoughtful.
Lynn, the housekeeper, thoughtfully asked me what I needed every day. When I checked in, she sent me the activities of Fun Camp and brought children's supplies and sand digging tools to my children.
The room was also very clean and my cosmetics were thoughtfully arranged. Thank you ๑•́₃•̀๑
Yuequ Camp has rich activities, all of which are free, and you can also pay for hosting. The teachers are very nice and very attentive to the children. I will stay at the Grand Hyatt next time. Big refill👄

This time, I had the service of Lynn, a private butler. She was very considerate and thoughtful. Overall, I was very satisfied. The only thing I felt was that the children's pool and the family pool closed too early, and there were too few places to swim at night. Everything else was pretty good. I would come again if I had the chance. I hope I can meet Lynn again next time.

msg:Let me talk about the advantages first. It is within walking distance from the food city, so there are many dining options. The price increase during the May Day holiday is reasonable. The room area is large enough and the supporting facilities are comprehensive.
Let's talk about the disadvantages: the details of management are not in place.
1. The shower room in the room leaks. I changed to another room and it still leaks.
2. The housekeeping depar**ent helped to pack the luggage and change the room, but they missed something and didn't pack it up. Fortunately, they found it in the end.
3. The housekeeping depar**ent cleaned up the used children's toothbrushes every day but did not replenish new ones. I had to wait for more than 20 minutes when I called for a children's toothbrush at night.
4. During the May Day holiday, it is understandable that breakfast was not replenished in time, but you can't replenish vegetarian food after eating meat, and replenish fried shrimp chips after eating fried fish fillets, right?
5. On the last day, I sat at the barbecue bar next to the swimming pool at around 9:40 in the morning (if I remember correctly) with my children waiting for the swimming pool to open at 10 o'clock. A manager (middle-aged woman with short hair) was loudly scolding the cleaning staff on the side. Her speech was very unpleasant and loud, and she didn't care whether we were sitting next to her and affected us.

msg:After reading many reviews online and struggling for a while, I still booked Grand Hyatt for the price that fits my budget after the May Day price increase. Good experience: Every time I enter and exit the hotel, there are concierge staff to help open and close the car door, take the luggage, and guide to the front desk. The lady who checked in was very enthusiastic. She introduced the activities and layout of the hotel to us and sent us to the elevator entrance of the South Building. In fact, it is not far from the room to the swimming pool and the beach. The hotel still provides free shuttle bus pick-up. Seeing that there are many mosquitoes in Grand Hyatt online, I brought mosquito repellent stickers and mosquito repellent sent by the housekeeper. Three people were not bitten by mosquitoes for two nights. There was basically no queue for breakfast before 8:40 for the two days of May Day. The food was also good, fresh, and the variety was not as good as the best, but better than the worst. It was able to take care of a little taste and eat full. It is very close to 68 Food City. It takes only two minutes from the South Building to 68 Food City. After checking in, the housekeeper contacted me in time. During the two nights of stay, there were almost all problems that were solved in seconds. When returning from the beach, lawn, and swimming pool, I sent a message to the housekeeper, and the housekeeper helped to call the shuttle bus, and they all replied in seconds. There are many activities and good vegetation. Wax apple trees and jackfruit trees can be seen in the hotel, and the green lawn is suitable for taking pictures. The hotel activities are also quite rich. The room is quite comfortable and spacious. I think the structural design of the room is not outdated. There is a cloakroom for luggage and clothes, which is very convenient. One day it rained, and there were staff members mopping the water on the ground at the corridor bridge leading to the lobby in the south building, all the time! It's really meticulous! Of course, there are also bad experiences: there are three swimming pools, and the green bricks used in the adult swimming pool make the water uncomfortable. Maybe it is to protect the vegetation, the overall layout design of the hotel seems a bit messy. The toilet seat in the room is broken (it will be crooked after sitting for a while, and I am scared). I was too lazy to tell the housekeeper because I was too lazy to change the room. To sum up: Although it is not perfect, I can still feel that the hotel staff want to do their best to provide good service, so the whole experience of staying in the hotel is more positive than negative, which is still good!

It is particularly important to note that the phenomenon of asking for good reviews in Sanya is very serious, but Grand Hyatt did not ask for good reviews at all, and they all felt that it was easy to write good reviews from the bottom of their hearts.
The hotel is very quiet, the service staff will greet you when they see you, and the room service will fold all the pajamas.
We booked a family room with a huge room cloakroom and bathroom.
There are three large counters for Chinese and Western cold dishes for breakfast, and three swimming pools are suitable for people with different travel purposes.
Although I think the games in Yuequying are childish, the kids have a lot of fun playing, and it is also close to the beach. The sand in Haitang Bay is very fine.
In the future, I should only choose Grand Hyatt to take my family on vacation!

He would greet us on WeChat every day, remind us to make reservations, and respond to messages very quickly. He also prepared surprise gifts for the children. He helped coordinate the delayed check-out, which was very considerate. The service and management of Grand Hyatt Sanya Haitang Bay are impeccable and worth recommending!

The hotel environment and facilities are okay, because there is a bit of a gap from the St. Regis Yalong Bay, but overall it is okay. It is not far from the beach and there is a beach exclusive to the hotel.
Room:
Staying in a sea view room, the hotel was upgraded to a high floor. The floor is high and you can see far away. You can overlook the sea from the balcony and watch the sunrise from the east in the morning. The angle is very good and the best viewing point.
Serve:
The hotel butler Kobe contacted us in advance on the day of check-in and upgraded us to a supreme sea view room. He answered all questions and provided considerate service.
Location:
I chose Haitang Bay because a friend recommended it, but after I came here I found that apart from visiting duty-free shops and parent-child activities, there wasn’t much for adults to do. Fortunately, you can rent a car and drive yourself. It’s a bit far to go to and from Phoenix Island to go yachting, and there is a food court next to it. Various flavors, but the price is a bit expensive.

The hotel is very close to the beach and can be reached on foot. My child had a lot of fun digging in the sand!

msg:My children wanted to experience a new hotel, so I searched on Ctrip in Sanya and temporarily chose the Grand Hyatt based on the cost-effectiveness and the two-bedroom room type I needed. To be honest, it far exceeded expectations. I am very good at picking hotels, hahaha.
Check-in: The front desk is a bit small, and there are not many places for children and the elderly to rest. I don’t know if it will affect the experience if it is during the peak season. The previous InterContinental separated the suite types into a check-in area, and the Grand Hyatt also has many larger units. You may consider learning from this to improve your stay experience.
Room type: The room is spacious, and the suite living room is large and not cramped. The advantage of the dual-connected house type is that you can move in early as long as one room is cleared out. The disadvantage is that there is no strong magnetic suction to hold the door after the connected door is opened. Combined with the wind in Haitang Bay, there is a risk. It is recommended that families with children use heavy chairs to block the door at all times during their stay. It’s also fun to watch the restaurant in the sky from the balcony.
Activity facilities: There is a gym on the fifth floor of the hotel (it is quite spacious and has a good view), KTV and video game room. When playing games, remember to ask for a card from the front desk on the fifth floor. Guests staying in the hotel are given a video game stored value card, which can be played several times for free. Parent-child activities are at Yuequ Camp, which is managed by Beiye Planet. There are many activities and the indoor and outdoor planning is relatively balanced. Children spend a lot of time there every day. Children also love watching the performances every night, but the speakers are too loud, which is a bit ear-piercing. There is a newly opened go-kart on the large lawn next to the sky restaurant. The price is very good and the speed is extremely slow, which is suitable for children to play.
Swimming pool: There are three swimming pools, and the two constant-temperature pools are quite large. I especially like the children's swimming pool. I saw someone complaining about the maintenance of the children's swimming pool on the Internet before. I checked the hotel's official children's swimming pool and opened it in mid-February. It is very fun. Before moving in in winter, it is recommended to call directly to ask about the status of the swimming pool and constant temperature. The small drawback is that there are no bath towels by the pool, and you need to go to the changing room across the path, which is a bit troublesome.
Service: I received a phone call from Alex from the hotel before check-in. On the day of check-in, the hotel map, facilities, timetable, etc. were quickly sent to me to ensure that we checked in as soon as possible and arranged the six days properly, including the shuttle bus. Alex can be found at any time to help me call. My child was bitten by a mosquito bite in the last hotel. Alex immediately asked the room service to send several bottles of electric mosquito repellent. He can also be found at any time to help with other matters. It is very comfortable. ~~~

The entire hotel has a Southeast Asian resort style, designed by Fu Houmin, with a staggered layout, tall and dense garden trees, winding paths, terraces and waterside pavilions, making it easy to stroll around. We took a paraglider and flew up to take a look. Among the hotels in the row, this hotel has the densest garden.
The service was great, everyone was well trained and polite. Check-in is quick and guests don't need to wait for a long time. The butler's response is extremely fast. Every time you ask for a request, he responds immediately and arranges it immediately. ###
The service in the buffet restaurant is also very good, the waiters will come quickly to clear the empty plates. Buffet (breakfast and dinner) catering meets five-star hotel standards.
Finally, I would like to express my views on negative reviews. I think our generation has studied dialectics for at least ten years. The teacher has taught us how to use dialectical thinking to look at problems for ten years. Every hotel will have shortcomings, just like ourselves, our own home will also have shortcomings, but should one or two shortcomings be completely negated? There is no such thing as perfection. But one should have the wisdom and heart to discover beauty and tolerate shortcomings.

I liked the Grand Hyatt the most and decided to stay there again. The hotel's setting is very elegant, and it feels like being on vacation in an exquisite botanical garden. Passing through the park is the seaside, and it is very leisurely to follow the hotel's shuttle bus. I experienced the Soothing Balancing and Cocktail Mixing activities that day, which was super comfortable. The water park in the children's area makes adults jealous after seeing it. The hotel rooms are very atmospheric and have great views. This is the best choice for vacation in Sanya. The last thing I want to say is that Hyatt's service can be said to be superior to that of Marriott. The butler Kobe provided attentive service throughout the entire process. On the ***** calendar day, a cake and decorations were specially arranged. Kobe responded to everything and everything was taken care of. Before leaving the store It's time to say goodbye, and I feel so heartwarming. The next day I transferred to the Ritz-Carlton, but the gap was huge. I wanted to check out due to service issues, so I contacted Kobe immediately and wanted to go back to the Grand Hyatt, but unfortunately the room was fully booked. For those who like the quality and warm feeling of an island vacation, Grand Hyatt Haitang Bay is the place to go!

msg:First of all, I would like to praise the housekeeper Lynn. She is enthusiastic, responsible and very careful in her work. During this period, she asked us if we needed to arrange a bathtub. She also helped us delay check-out on the day of check-out. She is a very good girl. The hotel room type is very good and the view is great. Beautiful, the swimming pool on the balcony is also very beautiful, very impressive, the room is very clean, the attitude of the guest room aunt is also warm, polite and very considerate. Secondly, the hotel management is not good, especially the service management, most of them The staff in the hotel lobby and executive lounge are very cold and impolite, with a straight face, and there is an illusion that they owe him money. The staff who answered the phone at the front desk also have a half-dead tone. The only receptionist in the hotel's executive lounge is the receptionist. The boy's attitude was okay, but the others were very bad. On the evening of February 17th, we had dinner in the executive lounge. Halfway through the meal, a female staff member came to collect the plates and asked us how many oranges we had not started eating. Do you want more? We asked, but she said we could help take it away. She spoke with an indifferent attitude, as if she was in a hurry to get off work and wanted us to leave early. There were only three hot dishes and three snacks in the executive lounge that night. There are only three cold dishes. Two of the three hot dishes are spicy. All three cold dishes are spicy. The fried chicken and popcorn are all spicy. There are not many dishes in the executive lounge. In this case, I don’t eat spicy food. If people go to eat, there will be nothing to eat. As the food of a five-star hotel, this arrangement is unreasonable. At that time, my baby and I had nothing to eat. I raised my opinion with the staff and said It’s unreasonable for you to arrange the dishes like this. Most of the dishes are spicy. Can you cook some non-spicy noodles for us? Most of your dishes are spicy. We and our babies don’t eat spicy food. , there was absolutely nothing to eat, and they said no. At that time, there was another female customer in the executive lounge who made comments to them and had an unpleasant experience. The hardware of this hotel is very good, and the design, layout and decoration of the hotel are very good. , the hotel rooms are still very clean, but the service management is really not that good. If some staff have a bad attitude, it may be due to personality differences. If most of the staff have a very bad attitude, then it is a big problem The probability is that there is something wrong with the service management. I hope they can better manage the attitude of the staff. It is really very cold and impolite. People go on vacation to have fun, but such an attitude will affect people's mood. Most of the staff have a bad attitude, but there are a small number of people who are very enthusiastic. For example, on the day we left the hotel, the concierge who sent us to the car was very enthusiastic. The hotel rooms are very good. , square and square, with good landscape and beautiful hotel design. There are some negligence in the management of public areas. The water quality of the pond and swimming pool in front of the Chinese restaurant needs to be improved.

The scenery was amazing, the room was large, and the facilities were complete. I especially want to say that the service was very good, and the service of the butler Lynn was excellent. He is said to be patient, meticulous, positive and proactive. He also sent cakes and fruits for two consecutive days on his birthday. My children and I enjoyed it very much. We spent almost all of the two days at the hotel and the beach. This stay experience makes me come back to Grand Hyatt next time.

You can walk there from the first floor of the hotel. You need to swipe the room card to open the door. It is 10 yuan to take a taxi from the duty-free shop. Wuzhizhou Island can be seen from the hotel balcony. The hotel room is quite large and has a large bathtub. It is very comfortable to take a bath facing the sea. The breakfast is good and rich. The overall service is worthy of praise ===

msg:Taking your kids on vacation in Sanya
The Grand Hyatt is really great
The hotel's hardware facilities are very online, worthy of being a Grand Hyatt
There is a dining pedestrian street just walking next door, which is also convenient for shopping.
You can take your kids to the hotel all the time. There are a lot of children's activities. You can make reservations when you check in. Unfortunately, my baby is young and I didn't go to participate. I watched other people play. It was well organized.
The hotel has its own children's water park, and the baby was impressed by the large bucket that fell down when it was full.
The hotel has its own small zoo, and the children's area is also very large. There are no people there. The ocean ball is the favorite for babies.
Each room is equipped with a dedicated butler, who helped us arrange a late check-out, and everything was very smooth.
The swimming pool room we stayed in had a big yellow duck in the swimming pool. The baby had a lot of fun sitting on it.
Each guest can apply for travel photography. Five photos are free. If you choose more, you will pay. However, if you take a lot of photos, you will have more to choose from. It is more expensive than asking for travel photography alone.
The dinner menu has a wide range of dishes, including red wine, white wine and beer, and group purchases are available.
There were really many people at breakfast, and the tables were being turned over all the time. Fortunately, the dishes were replenished in a timely manner.
The hotel staff helped coordinate and solve the problem in a timely manner, providing a comfortable experience for families traveling in Sanya.
Will stay here next time ===

The bed on the balcony was nice to lie down on. The bedding is comfortable and clean. The toiletries are from Balmain.
The entire hotel has a Southeast Asian resort style, with tall and dense trees in the garden, winding paths, terraces and waterside pavilions, making it easy to stroll around. The beach in the hotel is very beautiful and there are not many people, so it is suitable for strolling.
The service was great, everyone was well trained and polite. Check-in is quick and guests don't need to wait for a long time. Butler%%% service is good
The service in the buffet restaurant is also very good, the waiters will come quickly to clear the empty plates. Buffet (breakfast and dinner) catering meets five-star hotel standards%%%
However, there is no exhaust fan in the bathroom, which needs improvement.

The first floor of the hotel is connected to the 68 Food City, which has Star Papa and Heytea, KFC and Pizza Hut, as well as a Sichuan cuisine and Coconut Chicken and a Hong Kong-style tea restaurant. It is more convenient to bring children to eat. During your stay, you also like to eat at the nearby duty-free city. The hotel is convenient to take Didi. It takes a few minutes to go to the duty-free city and half an hour to Yalong Bay Tropical Paradise Forest Park. The children liked the hotel's breakfast very much. They participated in two children's activities. The tea made by the fire as part of the package was very good. Grand Hyatt is worth recommending.

The entire hotel has a beautiful environment, with large lawns and shady trees. If you walk slowly to the beach, it only takes 10 minutes, but if you take the train, there is a fee. The waves in Haitang Bay are really big, and there are not many people on the beach. The children have to dig in the sand every day and are reluctant to leave. There are many varieties of breakfast in the hotel. It is recommended to go early. If you go late, you may queue up. You can walk directly to Haitang 68 Global Food on the first floor of the hotel, which is very convenient.

msg:I took my mother to Sanya for vacation. Because she is very old, I thanked Vicky for her help and care during the three days. I specially chose a supreme sea view room with a good view and a short walk for my mother, and also gave her a fruit plate and snacks. My mother was very satisfied. Before deciding on the Grand Hyatt, I checked various Haitang Bay hotel recommendations and reviews. I felt that the rooms in this hotel were larger and newer. After all, the Hyatt brand is here. I thought it would be ok based on the conditions. My experience after joining the company was: 1. Three major , big room, big balcony, big bathtub; 2. Four beauties, beautiful modern decoration, beautiful sea view from the room, delicious breakfast, beautiful garden layout; 3. Five beauties, good service (responsive to all requests), good location (the hotel is directly connected to the food street), good activities (I like the complimentary afternoon tea very much), good privacy (not so noisy), and good taste (the whole hotel is elegant and charming). In addition, I would like to remind you that the rooms in the main building feel a bit larger and the decoration is very new. There is a large sofa on the balcony. It is very comfortable to see the sea view after 2 o'clock in the afternoon. The bathtub has a large viewing angle and is very beautiful, suitable for couples and families with children. You can watch the sunrise in the morning, even though I didn’t even get up...

I was very impressed with the hotel facilities. The swimming pool is one of my favorite places, it is spacious, the water is clear and makes you feel very comfortable. The hotel also offers a well-equipped fitness center so I can continue to exercise. Additionally, their spa offers a range of relaxing trea**ents and massages that left me feeling rejuvenated.

They always gave me good attention and care, both during the booking process and throughout my stay, and made me feel welcome.

msg:When we came to Sanya to play golf, we stayed at the Grand Hyatt. We were traveling as three best friends and chose a parent-child room. The room is very big and very comfortable! Beyond imagination👍The butler Max is also very considerate. When you arrive, there will be all kinds of thoughtful information to help solve practical problems.
Downstairs from the Grand Hyatt is the Haitang Liuba Food Court, a supermarket, shopping, and a walk for meals.
Sanya Duty Free Shop is nearby, which is very convenient😄
The breakfast at the hotel is delicious and the overall cost-effectiveness is high. You must consider this place when you come✌

msg:I can't wait to review it because I'm really disappointed.

Facilities: The door of the room is too difficult to use. The wooden door and the slide are stuck. The door on the left cannot be opened when closed. The door on the right directly gave me a black and purple blood bubble.

Hygiene: Hygiene is pretty good. I'm not particularly surprised, nor is it bad. This is an objective evaluation.
Environment: The lobby environment is very nice and has a Chris**as a**osphere. The heated swimming pool is nice. There are many shuttle buses.

Service: The most important thing to say is the service. The doorman was not enthusiastic and did not help carry the boxes. He had a bad attitude. The response from the housekeeper was indifferent. We went to stay at InterContinental next, and found that we couldn’t stay at InterContinental because we didn’t cancel the subscription. It was InterContinental that called us to cancel.


Generally speaking, I have been looking forward to Grand Hyatt, but this time I am really disappointed. If you are looking for a four-star price, you can understand it, but at this price and service, I am really disappointed. I hope the hotel will run well and not let everyone down because of the service. Sanya is beautiful, but this trip was very unhappy because of Grand Hyatt.

msg:The check-in experience was very good. It was indeed a Grand Hyatt hotel. I was rather picky about the bed. Fortunately, the mattress and pillows were very supportive and I slept comfortably. The room has an unobstructed view of the sea, and you can even enjoy the sea view while taking a bath.
The food court next to the hotel is also very convenient. I was worried that I might not be comfortable eating in a hotel every day, so I chose the Grand Hyatt. Coconut chicken, lees vinegar, red sand food stalls, Cantonese dim sum and Anhui cuisine hot pot KFC, there are all kinds of choices. When I get tired of coconuts, there is Starbucks Hey Tea right next to me.
The breakfast variety is quite rich, with Western, Chinese and fruit sections. It only takes about seven or eight minutes to walk from the hotel to the beach. The sand on the beach is very fine. The hotel service is very warm and thoughtful. There is a shuttle bus to and from Sanya Duty Free Shop every day. You need to make a reservation one day in advance (before 8 pm). In fact, it is very close to the duty free shop, about four kilometers away.
There are several outdoor swimming pools that are too big to play in. There are many kinds of breakfast, and even though the dinner is a simple meal, it is enough to fill you up, which is very comfortable.

Not only did I take the initiative to upgrade to a sea view room, but the room of more than 60 square meters was so spacious, comfortable and great that I extended my stay for two more days without hesitation. Second is the service, which is attentive and meticulous. Especially the butler Max sends greetings via WeChat every day, arranges cleaning, introduces hotel activity arrangements, and reminds people of things to pay attention to. It can be said that he is meticulous. The third is the environment. It is a stone's throw away from the commercial street Global Food City and is just downstairs. It is very convenient for eating and shopping. The hotel has a sea view, and it is great to watch the sunrise in the morning. The fourth is breakfast, with rich varieties and a wide range of choices, suitable for the tastes of tourists from all over the north and south. In short, I will stay at this hotel next year. ,,,

The housekeeper started contacting us before we even arrived to help us with our schedule. During check-in, we were shown around the hotel's facilities. Staying in the hotel comes with discounts at the duty-free shop, and there is also a commercial street at the door with all kinds of facilities. At the same time, the housekeeper is always concerned about our stay experience every day. The five days we stayed here gave us many little surprises, such as honeymoon decorations, bubble baths, and fruit snacks, which made us truly feel at home.
This time I got a free upgrade to a sea-view king bed room. You can almost see the panoramic view of the sea as soon as you enter the room. When you have nothing to do, you can sit on the balcony in a daze and bask in the sun. The room was very clean and cleaned thoroughly every day. The hotel also has its own free beach, which is only a five-minute walk away, so you can go for a walk every day.
The hotel has complete facilities. Walking in the hotel is like walking in a garden. The breakfast is rich in variety. There is also a free shuttle bus to the duty-free shop. Everything is perfect.
Thank you again for everything the Grand Hyatt Haitang Bay has prepared for us, and thank you to the housekeeper for your meticulous care. Hope we can meet again soon next time.

msg:In order to have a smooth National Day holiday, I have been choosing a hotel for almost a month.
I finally chose Haitang Bay Grand Hyatt, and I was not disappointed. I was very satisfied.
The housekeeper Xiaokang is also very good. She will ask when the room needs to be cleaned every day and if there is anything that needs help. She will also introduce interesting attractions in the surrounding area, so we went to Linwang Night Market and it was worth it. She also helped us contact the hotel. If there is anything I didn’t bring with me or if I need help, it will be delivered in time. A very cute little girl who knows Hainan very well.

1. Location: Opposite the hotel is Wuzhizhou Island, which you can see clearly from the balcony; the area around Haitang Bay is very quiet and not crowded, including the seaside of the hotel. The hotel is connected to the 68 Food Street. Eating is very convenient and the price is very good. Reasonable. If you are not used to seafood, there are Anhui cuisine, Sichuan cuisine, Hong Kong-style tea restaurants, Pizza Hut, KFC, etc. This is also one of the important reasons for choosing
2. Environment: The hotel is relatively quiet. Walking through the garden is the blue sea and blue sky. Although swimming is not allowed in Haitang Bay, it is no problem to wear a swimsuit on the beach. The sea water is very clean and the sand is very fine. Children will not have to worry about playing. Sitting on the beach is also very comfortable.

3. Hygiene: Very clean, the guest rooms are cleaned every day, which is very heart-warming. They also made warm decorations for the National Day. It was a surprise. Seeing that the children like to soak in the bathtub, they helped us lay an oversized bathtub cover and put bubbles on it. Bath, the children's pens and homework books are neatly stacked, and even the data cables are neatly arranged, happy

4. Hotel breakfast: I still like it very much. The biggest fear when traveling is not eating well. The breakfast at Grand Hyatt is very nutritious and healthy. I eat it full every day and can last until 2pm before I feel a little hungry.

Whenever I needed his help, he was able to solve it in time. He is very efficient and omnipotent. I wonder if I can specify it next time I come back. Alex takes us.
Secondly, special thanks to Sister Chen Xiaohui who cleans the room. She can judge the living habits of the guests from the use of consumables in the room. When cleaning the room every day, she is very considerate and provides us with the things we need most. She also makes special dishes for us. Decoration…! Sister Xiaohui's IQ and EQ are really high. I personally suggest that the hotel management can let her share her experience with depar**ent colleagues during meetings on how to capture the living habits of guests. That's awesome...!
Finally, let me talk about my other feelings about the hotel. I have stayed at the Sofitel twice before, and this time I stayed at the Marriott. After a side-by-side comparison...
The garden of Grand Hyatt is beyond the photo, and it’s so beautiful to take photos with…! Won for outdoor landscaping
The oversized bathtub with sea view is unbeatable...! Won!
Downstairs is the food court, which is super convenient for simple shopping and eating. Another win...!
There is a game arcade. It has been raining these days and there is no place to go. You can go to the game arcade to have fun. This is great...but some machines are broken, and the hotel will repair them in time.
but…! Breakfast lost... there is a pure Chinese food area, and one is more Chinese food area... There is only half of the western food area, and the other half is drinks and fruits. In terms of western food, it is much worse than Sofitel and Marriott... It is too painful for Western breakfast lovers , almost nothing to eat...!
I sincerely hope that the hotel’s breakfast can be revamped to include more Western-style dishes and improve the cooking level of Western-style pastries.
I originally wanted to give it 4.5 points because of the breakfast, but in the end I got it to full points because of Alex and Sister Chen Xiaohui.

So when I checked in this time, I told the front desk that I wanted a large bathtub in the north and south buildings directly facing the sea, and I was given a room as expected. The supreme sea view room in the north building has a good view. The biggest feeling this time is that the service has improved. When I checked in, the butler Kobe added WeChat and was always concerned about various details during the stay. I also happened to encounter a flash sale on the seafood buffet hot pot. I decided to try it. The seafood ingredients are rich and fresh, but the categories other than seafood are a bit lacking. Overall, the off-season stay experience was very good, and I will consider it again when visiting Haitang Bay in the future.

First of all, the overall environment of the hotel is beautiful. Located on the seaside, you can enjoy the beautiful scenery while walking in the seaside park. When you stay in a sea view room, you can open your eyes to the vast sea, which makes you feel relaxed. The room is clean and tidy, with all facilities available, especially the large bed, which is of moderate softness and firmness, making you full of energy after a good rest.

Additionally, we were impressed with the service. From check-in to check-out, the housekeeper Lily greeted us with a smile and met our various requirements with a meticulous service attitude. In terms of catering, the breakfast is rich and delicious, and some meals include local snacks, which truly reflect the authentic taste.

It is worth mentioning that the hotel's public area facilities are also very complete. The indoor swimming pool has flexible usage periods and the gym has complete equipment. In addition, the lobby hall is also very comfortable, and you can enjoy the sea view while resting.

In short, this trip to Sanya was completely shocked by the first-class service environment of Haitang Bay Grand Hyatt. Next time you come here, it will still be your first choice to vacation here and enjoy a leisurely vacation.

msg:I stayed at the Grand Hyatt for four nights and was quite satisfied. I liked the hotel's delicate garden design and the high-rise sea views from the guest rooms. I lived on the 12th floor of the south building. The rising sun and the rising moon were facing the guest rooms every day. There was a red sun in the morning and a bright moon in the evening. Sprinkling the sea, the scenery can be said to be very satisfying, and it is the best choice for stay-at-home vacations. The breakfast was within the standard, both Chinese and Western ingredients were very good, and the desserts and drinks were very satisfying. My favorite was cantaloupe juice, but the cooking of the dishes occasionally fluctuated, and one day the snow peas had an earthy smell. When you come out of the South Building, turn left and you will find 68 Food City. You can eat Sichuan, Hunan and seafood dishes. They are not expensive and can be eaten. Parking at the hotel is very convenient. Candy, the housekeeper, contacted and communicated before check-in. She asked every day if cleaning was needed. On the last day, she also arranged a late check-out based on the guest's situation. I was satisfied. The lady in charge of cleaning is also conscientious and pays attention to details. She will help put the clothes drying rack on the balcony to facilitate the drying of clothes, which is a good comment. I will come again in the future, I just hope that the eye-catching crane can disappear from the view of the south tower.

msg:The overall environment of the hotel is very good and the service is very considerate. After doing various strategies for this trip, I booked this hotel. The hotel was very considerate and upgraded the room type with a sea view. Everything I needed in the room was provided. It is especially suitable for everyone. It is convenient for people with many pieces of luggage and is completely sufficient. As for the service, the hotel has a shuttle bus to and from the duty-free shop (it is very close to the duty-free shop, and a taxi is only the starting price). It also has a cooperative photography shop for taking photos. The room type I booked came with 5 photos, and the photos were very good. In the end Said that the hotel's facilities are very good, the hotel is still relatively new. As soon as I checked in, I introduced the activity time. It is 45 minutes away from the sea. This time I went to Haitang Bay and I obviously felt that the waves in Haitang Bay were bigger than those in Sanya Bay, so it was more suitable for riding waves. There are also many swimming pools. At the same time, this time they really,,, and thoughtfully solved our needs. Various small tips on WeChat made the trip very easy and enjoyable. I felt the warmth of a strange city. I will go to Grand Hyatt next time.

I chose the Grand Hyatt after a long time and booked it. I live on the 13th floor of the main building. The sea view is really unbeatable. It’s amazing no matter how you take photos. The room is very big and clean. This time I booked a free fruit and mini bar, as well as baby supplies. In addition, it is specially delivered here. It is very close to the beach and is very convenient. If you don’t want to walk, you can take a battery car at the entrance of the lobby. After you come back from playing, just tell the housekeeper in advance that you want the battery car to pick you up ~
Breakfast is delicious! After eating for three days in a row, I felt great. The children's dining chairs are actually stokke. You can ask the waiter for baby tableware and bibs. Next to it is the 68 Food City. There is a passage directly to the hotel, which is very convenient for eating.
I was also pleasantly surprised by the film I sent during the trip. I met a guy who is very good at guiding me. Although the weather was average, the film turned out really well~
Generally speaking, Grand Hyatt is a great place to take your young baby to a hotel for vacation~

I would like to give her a five-star review first. She made me feel at home from the beginning, and I was in a good mood to start my stay in Haitang Bay. Relaxation and vacation. In the Supreme Sea View Twin Room, you can see the sunrise through the balcony when you open your eyes in the morning, and enjoy the beautiful morning glow for two days. The hotel's breakfast is more exquisite, and the fresh cream and muffins are really delicious. It may be due to the change. When the air conditioner is not turned on, the room has a musty smell, but it is fine after it is turned on. It takes about 10 minutes to walk from the guest room to the beach, but there is a hotel shuttle battery car. Haitang Bay only has a public beach, which is not as good as the hotel's own beach. There is an exclusive passage from the hotel to the 68 food street, which is very convenient.

msg:Little tail went to Sanya for the National Day
I had been wondering about the hotel in Yalong Bay before, but I was persuaded that it was too old, so I chose the not-so-popular Grand Hyatt.
Stayed for three days, let’s talk about my feelings today
Overall, unexpected
The weather is very good these days, and there are not many people at the end of the holiday.
The swimming pool is often reserved and there are not many people at breakfast.
The hotel has three swimming pools
1⃣️The children’s swimming pool has slides and topics suitable for babies. My baby was able to play about 100 times in three days and was so happy.
2⃣️The parent-child swimming pool has activities in the afternoon, and the pool is deep to shallow.
3⃣️There are some coconut trees in the adult swimming pool. You can swim there without being exposed to the sun when it’s hot at noon.
When I took my children to the hotel, they provided children's enclosures, children's quilts, bathrobes, and toiletries when they checked in. They also gave their children small gifts when they left. There are also many projects, but my baby is addicted to the swimming pool and the sea, so I didn’t check in for any of the projects.
[Love] [Love] [Love] The housekeeper Nancy is very considerate. From adjusting the room at the beginning, to meal reminders, peripheral entertainment recommendations, daily cleaning arrangements, minibar refills, and fruit delivery. They are all considerate and considerate. I give this girl a thumbs up [strong]
[Love] [Love] [Love] In addition, I will tell you a few highlights of her family.
1⃣️This large bathtub is a highlight. There is also a disposable bathtub cover. You can play with water in the hotel when it is too hot. The bathtub is big enough.
2⃣️Battery cars, small battery cars are very convenient, and the service is very good. You can call when you need it, and you can do it if you encounter it on the road. It's not far to walk to the beach and swimming pool, but it's more convenient to take a battery car.
3⃣️The hotel is located on a 68 commercial street. It is very convenient to go there from the first floor of the hotel. There are all kinds of food, snacks, fruits, supermarkets, and clothes. You can choose your own seafood and the price is not bad
There are several restaurants in the hotel
Personally, I think the breakfast buffet is average, with a little less variety. But the Eggs Benedict was so good that I ate it two days in a row and had salmon for breakfast.
There are also Chinese restaurants and Western restaurants
The hotel can also order takeout, so it is very convenient to go for takeout. Nowadays, hotels are increasingly following the public.
Another thing I can’t understand is why there are no deck chairs on the beach [naughty]
Generally speaking, the Grand Hyatt is a relatively quiet and private hotel, and it is very cost-effective. Recommended.

I stayed in an east-facing ocean view room and could see the sunrise. The breakfast was great. The hotel's camping barbecue was great. It tastes good and is very popular. The fun camp in the hotel is a favorite among children. When I left, I couldn’t bear to leave the teachers there. The housekeeping service is also very good. It’s a hotel suitable for children.
One thing to mention, there are many sharp corners and right-angled edges in the room. It is recommended to add some protective measures.
Overall great, highly recommended

It takes about seven or eight minutes to walk to the beach. You can also reserve a shuttle bus in advance. The sunrise and sunset on the beach create a great a**osphere.

The layout of the rooms is very good and comfortable. The swimming pool on the first floor is also relatively large. The hotel thoughtfully put swimming rings and flamingo floating toys, which are very suitable for taking pictures, and the children had a great time playing.

Children can learn knowledge and make good friends from them. The hotel service is considerate. The butler Lynn will help us coordinate the battery car every day, ask if we need to change towels and bedding, inform the children about the activities, and even send us welcome fruits every day. There are many types of drinks in the refrigerator, and they will be replenished every day after drinking. The concierge service is enthusiastic.

Reflects the professional standards of Grand Hyatt Hotels
Four-day trip to Sanya. It’s so comfortable to stay in a hotel.
Next to the hotel is a food street where you can eat, drink and have fun without having to cross the street.
In addition, the hotel's breakfast is excellent. I like it. The scarf was left in the restaurant. I only remembered it the next day. I didn't expect the waiter to keep it for us. Thank you so much🙏

msg:I stayed at Haitang Grand Hyatt for the second time in 5 years and booked two rooms. Traveling during the Golden Week is about exchanging money for time and fulfilling children’s little wishes. It is very important to choose a hotel carefully. I have stayed here for 18 years and I think it is very good. I will still choose it this time. After all, after five years, the hotel facilities are still a bit outdated. It rained continuously last week and the rooms on the lower floors were also a bit damp. When Max, the butler, learned about our feelings, he dealt with it immediately and upgraded us to a room on the higher floors. He also specially arranged fruit snacks every day. , caring and greetings at different times, and also helped to make reservations for travel photography, children's activities, etc. in advance; there is no perfect hotel, only attentive and considerate service can ignore some flaws. In fact, the fruit snacks are not important, and we can’t finish them, nor are the free travel photos. We also know in our hearts that they are all cooperating with third parties. We always choose things that we think are valuable. If they are valuable, we are willing to pay for them, and we don’t care. ; Those who can go out to play at this time, I believe they also travel frequently, and know all the routines. What everyone actually needs is to be valued and treated with courtesy after high efforts, so that we can understand and trust each other. Thanks again to Max for her service. She sincerely hopes that the hotel will continue to leave a good impression on us and that Sanya will continue to be one of our seaside vacation destinations.
Facilities: I think the best thing is the bathtub, which is large, square, and has a great sea view. I took the children to play in the children's pool in the morning, and when I returned to the room at noon, I found the surprise arrangement of a bubble bath, which felt very comfortable. Toiletries are also carefully placed.
Fun camp activities for kids: Resort hotels are no longer about staying in a hotel and sleeping in them. The most important thing is the hotel’s content arrangements, which are full of things. There are many manual and sports activities. Let the children experience new sports and have fun and sweat profusely.
Environment: The sand on the beach is suitable for riding waves. You can catch sand crabs in the evening. The children mastered the method and saw the sand holes and crawling marks. We caught a lot and the children were very happy. Of course, they were released later.
Breakfast: This must be mentioned, it is very good. First, the Chinese dishes are rich and of good quality and taste; second, the dishes are replenished quickly and in sufficient quantity. The noodles and flour toppings are well fried.

msg:There were so many people on the first day of the National Day holiday that I didn’t expect. I was lucky to have good weather during the five-day holiday. The service quality of the hotel was excellent. The staff would greet guests when they met on the road. There were activities for children every day. We arrived in the morning. It's all there in the evening, there are pictures and the truth; I would like to give a special comment to the housekeeper Vicky. From the first day to the end when she returned home, she always maintained cordial greetings, answered all questions, and arranged a bubble bath and bed for the children during their stay. The decoration made the child very happy. Since we booked a drop-off for the afternoon of the last day, we also helped extend the check-out time. The overall service and experience are very satisfactory🥳

msg:It was my first time to stay at the Grand Hyatt Hotel and it was a really good experience. Especially the housekeeper Vicky added WeChat in advance and thoughtfully helped prepare birthday cakes, special room service for the Mid-Autumn Festival and prepared bubble baths in advance. After a tiring day, It was really pleasant to take a bubble bath in the huge bathtub after returning to the hotel (the water temperature was just right). After checking out, I prepared small gifts for the children🎁. There are so many hotels in Sanya Haitang Bay, and only a handful of them have hardware facilities and services online at the same time. Grand Hyatt has really done a good job, and the recommendation index is five stars!

msg:A very satisfying stay experience. The room is really big + the layout is very good. It feels great to stay here. We stayed here for three consecutive nights. We contacted the housekeeper Nancy to help solve some minor issues in time. She also helped us for the next two nights. Every room has been upgraded to supreme sea view. The first thing I do when I wake up is sit on the toilet and enjoy the sea view. Happiness is so easy~

Facilities: The most important thing is the beach and swimming pool. The sunrise on the sea is the most exquisite and exquisite thing that I am most satisfied with during this trip. The beach view is okay, the sand is quite numb; the swimming pool is actually good, although it is not big and not many. The disadvantage is that it is too hidden. , I passed by the beach several times and never saw it...

Environment: The greening of the hotel is quite good, full of tropical plants, and the coconut lawn is also beautiful; however, you will see some garbage in the corridor of the room...

Service: The service is really good. Unlike other reviews that showed no response, all my problems were solved in a timely manner👍🏻It is a warm service!

Service: The travel photos provided in the room are really rubbish! ! ! The film quality is poor! The photos were all overexposed, with the background so white that you couldn't see the sea at all. The photographer had a very bad attitude when choosing the photos. First, he tried to sell me a package deal. The photos I deleted repeatedly suggested that I took good photos and shouldn't delete them. 35 pictures , I didn’t want it, so I just said it was a waste of his time, and ended up spending an extra 500 yuan to buy some crappy photos...

Whether it was hotel facilities or comprehensive facilities and butler services, they were absolutely the best. I originally thought that I would not have such an experience if I traveled during the off-peak season. I was really pleasantly surprised. , the housekeeper Lynn called me before I checked in, and upgraded the room to a sea view suite for free. The service was very considerate, and finally the Grand Hyatt's delicious food was served in Haitang Bay!

The hotel facilities are very new, and there are many types of breakfast. There are not many people at the end of the summer vacation. It is recommended to have breakfast before 9:30, otherwise there will be a queue during the peak period~
We like to stay in the hotel and step on the water by the sea. The adult swimming pool is recommended to go to the one next to the children's swimming pool. Even the water quality looks cleaner and the area is larger~
The garden landscape design of the hotel is very exquisite. Friends who like to take pictures can unlock it by themselves from the gate to the restaurant and the seaside.
Finally, I would like to say that the hotel staff still have a very good service attitude, kind and patient. The housekeeper Kobe contacted me in advance and also helped to delay check-out until 14:00. It was a very satisfactory experience~

The breakfast is exquisite. The American coffee and steamed noodles are very impressive. Very delicious😋

The hotel's service is really accommodating. When we checked in, the butler Kobe upgraded us to a luxury suite and explained all the hotel's facilities to us in detail. Everything was really for the sake of the guests, and he could solve it in time when we needed his help. Thanks to Chen Xiaohui and Xue Qixiang, the room cleaners, for being able to provide us with what we need most from our daily habits.

msg:The most satisfying thing about our stay at the Grand Hyatt this time is the service. From the front desk where we checked in to the guest rooms, every waiter had a great attitude and took the trouble. Especially when we met the attentive butler Xiaokang, we deeply realized that it is a real thing for Grand Hyatt Hotel to go to the butler when we have problems. If you have any questions, you can contact Xiaokang Guanjia through WeChat without calling, and we will respond quickly and solve the problem. We send WeChat messages every day as a warm reminder service. What particularly touched me was that after we left the hotel, we found that we had left something behind. We immediately contacted Xiaokang Housekeeper through WeChat. She kept our things in a timely manner, and then actively helped us contact us and gave the items to us. It was very touching. memorable!
Another thing that I remember deeply is that when we returned to the hotel room tiredly, the room attendant Shi Xiaoyan found a note and she made bubble baths in the bathtubs of both rooms for us. We saw rose petals on the water. , all the fatigue was gone, and there was only emotion.
Although the hardware facilities of the Grand Hyatt Hotel are a bit old, the service is very good! Like 👍

It's really great. Before I even arrived at the hotel, the housekeeper Xiaokang contacted me in advance and arranged the room. He also arranged a turndown service in the evening. If I have any questions, I can directly contact her and she will reply to me quickly, including shopping and eating.
The large bathtub in the room was very clean. After taking a bath on the first morning, I went out to play. When I came back in the evening, I found that the waiter Chen Xiao had cleaned the bathtub and prepared a rose bubble bath.

Facilities: There is a courier channel in the hotel lobby that leads directly to the food court, which is very suitable for those of us who don’t want to be special forces. The gym environment is very good and open 24 hours a day. It is really a stay experience that exceeds expectations.
Others: Ctrip offered me a room upgrade, and the supreme sea view lived up to my expectations. The bathtub faces the sea view, which is truly comfortable and relaxing.

Environment: I originally thought that the Grand Hyatt is a business-oriented hotel and I wasn’t very excited about the environment. Unexpectedly, the night view was amazing after arriving on the first night. There are also lights on the beach at night, which makes it easy to take pictures and have fun in the water, but please pay attention to safety. Walking around the hotel during the day, you can see the shadow of coconut trees and there are no mosquitoes.

The housekeeper Lily helped us reserve the upper floor of the south building early. The view and scenery are beautiful. Moreover, the housekeeper Lily is dedicated to her duties and deserves recognition.
The room was decorated for us one day, which was very nice. The mini bar is replenished every day.
The breakfast is very rich, with both Chinese and Western options, but I'm a bit tired of eating it for five days.
It was a little unpleasant, probably because the facilities were really old. One day the doorbell rang automatically and every once in a while, and then the staff came and cut off the power.
There are three swimming pools, which are really small.

msg:Let’s briefly evaluate it in the order of the pictures:
The first is breakfast: in addition to the unexpected long queues and having to endure seats without air conditioning, the most important thing is that you can also eat the hair of someone who doesn’t know who it is... In the current situation of the epidemic, which is mutating again and again. How can such a problem still occur next time... It's really one word, absolutely!
Secondly, the room: The 1.8*2m king-bed room we initially booked was a supreme ocean view room. It was really a bit too small for a family of three. I thought the twin rooms would be bigger if they were put together, so I started my journey to change rooms. But the smell in the room and the lint flying all over the house were really unbearable. Then I moved to the swimming pool room, and pictures 3 and 4 were produced. The one-meter-wide pool has steps for one meter, and there are two steps where there are no steps. There are tables of different heights, there are no warning signs and no protective measures, so the toes can be broken. The hotel said: I am really sorry, really embarrassed, extremely embarrassed, all kinds of embarrassing. (The hotel regulations are 8-15 floors, whether it is the main building, the south building or the north building, they are called supreme sea view rooms)
In terms of entertainment: there are several rabbits, three ducks and three big white geese in the pet park. The inflatable castle is about 30 to 50 square meters, with insufficient lighting and very small. It is quite far from the main building and close to the swimming pool, so the swimming pool is further away from the main building. Far……
If you need to send children's toiletries or something, you need to reserve time in advance, because it will take longer than you expected...
So I would like to advise friends who are choosing to go to Sanya Haitang Bay to choose this hotel carefully!

Room facilities: old
Value for money: low
Breakfast: poor
Bed: small
Restaurant: small and unhygienic
Hygiene: There are hairs in the food, lint in the house, and steel wires in the swimming pool.
Service: Everything you need waits

Although it is the summer peak season, the service is not neglected at all, and the butler service has been added compared to the past. Thanks to the housekeeper Kobe for upgrading us to a sea view room and getting an extra bed. He greeted us intimately every day and even arranged a temporary rest after check-out. A young lady wearing glasses at the front desk has a very good service attitude and answers questions carefully.

There are many delicious restaurants. It is very convenient to go to the duty-free shop for a starting price. This time the hotel also provides youth activities, but unfortunately there are too few places and you have to work hard. However, the entertainment room can provide 20 coins for free experience, the children had a good time and recharged. In addition, the steps at the door of the room in the south building are not obvious enough, and the old father stumbled. After the reaction, the hotel's positive attitude is quite satisfactory. In short, among the many five-star hotels I have stayed in Sanya, this one can be used twice to show my love for it.

msg:The housekeeper will contact you one day before check-in to confirm the check-in time, and the perception is good. This should also effectively prevent guests from waiting too long for check-in. After check-in, information such as activities will be sent. If you have any questions, you can contact them directly, which is more convenient. There is no coffee machine in the room, just regular bagged coffee. The bathtub is indeed huge and facing the sea, which is beautiful. The service in the breakfast room is very average, not enthusiastic, and the perception is not good. The waves are indeed not small, but they are beautiful and the sand is very fine.

msg:Very satisfied trip. The hotel directly fills the satisfaction of the journey.
After checking in, I added the housekeeper Vicky’s WeChat account. When I entered the room, it was damp, and I immediately changed to a room on a higher floor. Vicky specially prepared fruits. The peaches in Sanya are really delicious! Vicky, who knows how to answer questions, recommends delicious restaurants nearby. The aunt cleans every day, very clean and tidy.
It is worth mentioning two points:
1. The hotel's breakfast can also be seen in the picture. Very rich. These we took were only 1/3 of all the buffet dishes.
2. The coconut grove in the hotel is very popular, and the handicapped party can also make a big movie with a sense of sight!
The hotel comes with a photo shoot, and the photography teacher's technique is really amazing. The hotel has four swimming pools. I didn't experience it because the schedule was too full. I must come to swim next time! Plus, it's within walking distance to the beach, not to be missed!
The day before I left, the housekeeper Vicky delivered another fruit, which was a very satisfying experience!

msg:I’ve been to Sanya many times, and it’s my first time staying at Grand Hyatt. Ctrip offers free early check-in and free upgrades. I didn’t enjoy early check-in, but this is basically the case for hotels in Sanya, and it’s acceptable.
The check-in area is separate and has air-conditioning. This is a good review, and there is no need to queue up to check in sweaty.
The room gave a selected sea view on the 16th floor (it seems to be called this?). The view is very good, the sea view is great, and I even got up early to watch the sunrise.
The bathtub is very big, too big, and the ordinary disposable bathtub film can't cover it at all. It takes about half an hour to fill up the water to reach half the height of the bathtub. It is very spacious for two children to soak in the bathtub together.
There are many activities in the fun camp, and the children have a lot of fun. It’s just that the indoor part of Joy Camp is a bit small, and the playability is not high.
I experienced the family swimming pool, and I went there after four o'clock in the afternoon, and it was still a bit dry. The bubble party in the evening was very pleasant, and the children had a great time.
The hotel's garden is super beautiful. It is very convenient to go to the beach, the fun camp, and the swimming pool. You can go to the lobby to take a battery car.
Next to it is the 68 Food City. I have eaten at the Hongsha food stall twice, which is very convenient.

Facilities: There are many swimming pools in the hotel, and there is also a very fun slide water park. In the evening, there are bubble activities. The children refuse to go ashore after playing. There are afternoon tea and cocktail parties every day. It is a very quiet environment. There are not many things but enough Pad the stomach for the children, relax for the adults, and show off the watermelon is over.
Hygiene: The sanitation is very good, the room is very clean, and the cleaning is also timely. Ask the housekeeper for more slippers and bath towels, and they will be delivered quickly. Very fast, and the service is great
Environment: Rich greenery, a few steps away from the beach, the beach is very clean, the water is very blue when the weather is good, it is really refreshing to look down from the balcony
Service: The service is very good, the front desk, the housekeeper, and the passing staff will say hello when they meet. The welcome at the door has been thoughtful to help open and close the car door and carry the luggage, all of which are full marks.
4. Food selection: The restaurants in the hotel provide a variety of food options with high quality, so that guests can enjoy the food to their heart's content.

5. Warm and comfortable: The environment of the hotel is very warm and comfortable, with exquisite decoration and comfortable bedding, so that people can get full rest and relaxation.

In general, Grand Hyatt Sanya Haitang Bay has left a deep impression on tourists with its excellent location, high-quality service and complete facilities, and has received a lot of praise. Whether it is a vacation or a business trip, this hotel is an ideal choice.

The maintenance of the hotel and the arrangement of parent-child activities are very good. The occupancy rate is extremely high and there are many children. When various situations inevitably occur, I would like to thank the staff for their hard work, so that we can have a better check-in experience! Mosquitoes are unavoidable in tropical areas, but the allocation is still their own problem, so you must like it! For resort hotels, hardware facilities and service management complement each other! Thanks again to all the hotel staff for their warm and thoughtful service during your stay, which made the holiday a perfect ending!

msg:First of all, the location is good. The elevator to the first floor is the 68 Food City, which is very close to Atlantis Water World and the duty-free shop.
Secondly, the service of the hotel is good, and the suites booked have daily administrative benefits. Although there are not many types of meals compared to the first floor, fortunately, there are relatively few people. The room is large in size, with double balconies and beautiful scenery.
Free extra bed for children under 11 years old, free breakfast, which is very good 😊
A bit far from the beach, but there is a shuttle bus,
Finally, let me talk about the shortcomings:
1. The sea view suite booked through the platform 11 days in advance was exchanged for early check-in and late check-out, and I took the initiative to contact the hotel a week in advance to confirm the extra bed and floor, but the girl at the front desk said she was not clear about my reservation requirements on the day of check-in , The room allocation is unreasonable, I live on the 9th floor of the main building, and the Regency Club is on the 10th floor of the north building, and the girl at the front desk gave me wrong information about the main building and the north building,
2. The cleanliness of the room is very poor, especially the carpet in the living room, which is super disgusting, and the underside of the carpet is probably not cleaned at ordinary times. There are obvious blood stains on the bed quilt, the floor is severely worn, and there are scratches everywhere. The room allocated at the beginning should be In the connecting suite, there is a door connected to the next door, which disgusts me the most. No kid's toiletries, bathrobes. There is no drinking water.
Later, I communicated with the housekeeper and the duty manager to change and upgrade the room.
Leaving aside the shortcomings of the hotel's hardware, the service is still good. When encountering problems, they can respond in a timely manner, and the housekeeper is also very responsible.

Before I checked in, I received a call from the personal butler Vicky, asking about our check-in time and helping us arrange the room at the same time. He was very considerate, so that we can check in directly when we check in without waiting any longer. This time I chose the Supreme Sea View Room. The room is very large and clean. The bathroom has two sinks, which is very convenient. There is also a large bathtub, where you can enjoy the sea view while taking a bath. Grand Hyatt is especially suitable for children. There are activities for children at every time period from morning to night. My son likes it very much. The breakfast is also very rich, but there are many people who need to queue up during the holidays. The poolside grill restaurant is also delicious, and there is also a menu suitable for children. Special thanks to the butler Vicky for her full service. If you have any questions, contact her directly to help solve them quickly. The full experience of the whole process is full 💯 and I will choose Grand Hyatt next time.

msg:The overall experience is very average, sorry for the price of 3000 a night
First of all: Check-in is very slow, but the front desk service is more enthusiastic. After getting the room card, they will help guide the way to the elevator. Other staff have checked a lot in other hotels, and they basically don’t know how to say hello. The most enthusiastic one is the salesperson of the clothing store in front of the restaurant on the first floor;
Second: The room problem. There is a door leading to the next door in the sea view suite room. Although it is locked, it is not soundproof. You can hear the next door talking loudly, which makes you feel unsafe. Not sure if it was just this room when I checked in or if it was all ocean suites. In this case, the front desk should at least explain it, but nothing was mentioned.
Third: service awareness and facilities: it is marked that 3 people can stay, and there are two big and two small in the details, but the room only has bedding on the big bed, and the third person wants to sleep on the sofa without pillows and bedding, so you need to contact the front desk; Toiletries, washing cups and slippers are only for two people. I don't understand why it can't be provided according to the number of people since it is written that there are three people staying. In addition, it is stated that children's toiletries are not available;
Fourth: Catering, if you go to breakfast at 9 o'clock, you have to queue 20 meters in line, dare you believe it! ? There is no indoor space in the Regency Club, so you can only eat on the outdoor balcony under the sun, and because there are too many people, there are not many types of meals, and the new ones are very slow, so you can eat whichever you catch up with.
In short, the experience of Grand Hyatt Haitang Bay this time is very poor, not to mention the facilities, regardless of service awareness, service level and reception capacity, I am sorry for the brand and price.
This is the first time I wrote a review with so many words. It really refreshed the lower limit of experience. Of course, this is just my personal opinion of this stay. The pictures are a bit messy and I don’t bother to sort them out. They are just for reference.

msg:The first time I traveled to Sanya, after repeated comparisons, I chose Grand Hyatt. A few days before the trip, I received an active contact from the hotel housekeeper Max to understand our travel plans and check-in expectations. Knowing my family's birthday, butler Max worked hard to upgrade us to a sea view suite and enjoy executive lounge trea**ent, providing us with the best hotel experience! The room was carefully decorated, and red wine was presented as a small birthday gift, which was really thoughtful and pleasantly surprised! During the stay in the hotel, for all small details, please contact Max at any time, and get timely and effective answers and help. At the same time, I also feel that the staff of the hotel are very enthusiastic in providing services. The cleaning aunt, the staff in the lobby, the waiters in the cafeteria, and the brother in the juice bar by the children's pool all made us feel kind~ Before the baby goes to elementary school , We go on a trip almost once a month. Over the years, we have checked in many hotels with our children. It is really the first time we have stayed in such an all-round high-quality hotel and met such a fairy butler who takes care of us at 360 degrees. On the day we left the store, due to the early flight, we had no chance to have breakfast at all. It was very late the night before departure and we told the butler with the mentality of trying our luck. As a result, when we checked out the next morning, Max had already asked the front desk to pack 3 Let us take a breakfast on the road, I can't express my touch! I haven't had a chance to meet Max in person to say thank you, but he has been taking care of us and many other families staying in the hotel. I am really grateful~ There are too many beautiful details. The hotel makes people feel at home and warm. Counting them one by one, I hope Grand Hyatt will continue to provide such caring and professional services, and become the warmest parent-child hotel in Sanya (I know that there are many hotel choices in Sanya, but the warm ones make the family feel comfortable, and the details are the most important in my heart. YYDS Ceiling 😍)~

🍀I would like to add that the hotel's hot pot buffet has unstoppable seafood ingredients~ There is also a self-service pick-up area for children!

😍A variety of freshly squeezed juices for the breakfast buffet, invincible, fresh and delicious!

😌Usually I never write comments. As a mother with a baby, I record some bits and pieces, hoping to refer to other friends in need. Attached are the hotel's open view photos

The housekeeper, Xiaokang, helped me to reserve a room on a high floor in advance. The large viewing balcony and double bathtub in the room are a major highlight. The view overlooking the sea is refreshing. The view from the road from the hotel to the beach is also very nice. The bedding and linen in the room are very comfortable. I am especially satisfied that the sound insulation in the corridor and in the room is very good.

msg:I have more affection for Grand Hyatt and Park Hyatt. I like its urban and stable feel, and the price is acceptable, so this time I brought my children here and chose this one among the hotels. How should I put it, I still have a few opinions to express: 1. The room is very large, and the design tone is also Grand Hyatt Park Hyatt, but it may be because it was transplanted to the seaside, and the color of the wood seems to have faded, and the texture is poor. In addition, it is mainly the room Has a strong musty smell. Cavestone OK. 2 The design of the hotel is relatively hidden, that is, there are winding paths everywhere. Although there are battery cars, the overall a**osphere is actually more suitable for young couples. Children love to run around. In fact, an environment with a proper sense of transparency is more suitable for children. 3 Thank you for sending fruit and drinks in the refrigerator. But when I booked a hotel in another place later that night, Ctrip jumped to give me this price reduction, thank you Ctrip... The price dropped should not have been seen in the previous two weeks. 4 The hotel's electric mosquito repellent liquid is gone, and it stands to reason that the guest room should not forget to replenish it. I was bitten by something, and I called the front desk to ask for it after my hand became swollen for no reason. It took a long time to deliver it. How long has it been? I just sent it after the swelling had started to subside. When I received it, it was already past the most itchy time. I actually had the mentality of "I'm glad it's here", but the boy said, I'm sorry to make you wait so long, especially Sincerely, so sincerely that I feel... so you still know that I have been waiting for a long time, so why don't you come sooner! In fact, it can still be trained. Many waiters here are a bit... How should I put it, such as breakfast, it’s okay for me to pick up the coffee myself, the waiter asked me what I wanted and brought it to me, then I’m OK, I’ve finished eating all the questions, and it’s another three A waiter asked, and they dragged one by one. The last one told me that the coffee I wanted was not available, and brought it to me in a different kind. There are quite a few things like this. For example, the battery car is also the same. One child’s service is very good, and the other is far behind. I feel that the confusion caused by a service of 90 points and a service of 60 points is not as good as the service of 70 points is actually OK. Because the feeling of the hotel is a bit of a roller coaster. For example, I didn’t ask for a butler at the beginning. If you arranged for me to have a butler, I’ll be okay. I’ve already left the hotel. What the hell is the butler asking me to write his name in a hotel review? Is this Grand Hyatt? I felt like I was on a tour bus. 5 The advantages still need to be said, the drainage of this bathtub is well done, and the water pipe is not noisy when draining, which is rare. But in the middle of the night, the air conditioner will suddenly be a little loud, maybe it's because I'm too tired after running it all day. It seems that it is better not to insert the room card all the time. 6 The restaurant is the biggest problem. The design of this restaurant is also the same. When you walk to the first floor, it feels dark and there are many people in line. There are a lot of vacant seats, and the waiters are nervously clearing up... Anyway, it feels like everyone is working hard, but it doesn't look like Grand Hyatt. in this way. Still can't say anything. Next time I will stay in another hotel group to see if there are so-called Sanya characteristics and find out why.

The handsome guy James at the front desk was very nice. He upgraded the sea view room for free. Considering that the child has just turned 12 years old, he helped me for free. The breakfast fee, the process is very smooth, praise. In addition, the butler Kobe is also very considerate. After checking in, he sent me all the activities and precautions. If there are any problems, they help me solve them in a timely manner, praise. Let's talk about the room, it is very big, the bathtub is big, you can see the sea, the balcony is also big, there are leisure sofas and tables, very comfortable. I am more concerned about breakfast. The breakfast here is very rich, which makes me and my family very satisfied. The hotel's children's entertainment pool is great, with several slides and a large bucket, which sprinkles water like a waterfall from time to time. It's very fun. I couldn't help but play all morning. There are not many people in the other swimming pools. My house has been booked out twice. The swimming pools are very clean and the experience is very good. It is also very close to the beach. If you don't want to walk, you can call a battery car to pick you up at any time. The hotel is also very close to the 68 commercial street, you can pass directly from the hotel, it is very convenient for eating and shopping. Originally, a travel photo was given as a gift, but the weather was too hot and I didn't have time to take a photo. All in all, the experience at Grand Hyatt is great, I will stay here again next time, I recommend everyone to stay here.

Whether it is the working attitude of the restaurant service staff or the speed of the butler Kobe's due diligence in responding to the service, I can see the service concept that Grand Hyatt has been pursuing. In addition, the activities arranged by Joy Camp every day, there are many courses for children and adults, all of which are very interesting, especially suitable for hiding indoor activities during the day because of the sweltering heat.
If you want to talk about shortcomings. The type and taste of the breakfast are quite satisfactory, not too refreshing, and there are too many people, the distance between the tables is too close, which will affect each other's dining

Although there was a small accident, the hotel will deal with it in a timely manner, especially the butler Alex came to deal with it immediately and arranged a car to go to the hospital to accompany and take care of him. He also upgraded the swimming pool room for free. The children like it very much. The hotel breakfast is also very rich. The room is very large and the facilities are very new.

msg:When I first checked in, I didn't think there were many surprises. The architectural style of the hotel is very similar to the hotel I stayed in before. But after actually staying in the hotel, I found that the service is considerate and the facilities are super perfect, especially suitable for children and the elderly. It goes directly to the beach through the coconut grove and the hotel path (there is a battery car parking to pick up and drop off at any two points in the hotel). The sea view is super beautiful, across the sea is Wuzhizhou Island. There are three pools to splash around in and this one is awesome! After check-in, there will be a personal butler, who is attentive and patient, and the service is in place. Give Alex a thumbs up👍 Finally, he also assisted other colleagues in the hotel to help my baby find the lost doll. I will consider staying again when I come to Hainan in the future. It is one of the must-have hotels for leisure and vacation!

The housekeeper MAX called one day in advance to confirm the room and prepared the equipment for the children. During the stay, I also helped to solve many problems at any time. On the last day, I had an early flight and didn’t have time to eat breakfast. I also prepared a breakfast box and placed it at the front desk. I like the service of Grand Hyatt 👍The sea view is also very beautiful, and there is a food street next to it. It's also convenient to walk to eat, and I will choose it next time

msg:Five years ago, I took my children to live in Grand Hyatt, and I chose to stay in Grand Hyatt five years later. The overall service has been improved a lot. Grand Hyatt is a low-key luxury, with one-on-one private butlers. The butler candy provides considerate service and is always on call. The room where I first checked in had a particularly strong musty smell, and I changed the room immediately after feedback. The breakfast service is particularly good, with many types and good service. orderly! I also sent five photos from the trip. The overall service is very good. If the room facilities are maintained and updated, it will be more perfect! Give candy a thumbs up for the thoughtful service ❤❤❤

msg:The worst service in any five-star hotel I have ever stayed in. We, four adults and one baby, chose a two-bedroom suite and stayed for 11 nights. 1. From the first day, I felt that the service attitude of the hotel staff was cold. There are very few types of executive breakfast and executive afternoon tea in the Grand Hotel. The highlight is that the service staff had a cold face and reluctantly asked her to get a baby high chair. On the contrary, the cafe service on the first floor is okay and there are many kinds of breakfast. 2. We are four adults and have a baby. On the first day, the housekeeper only gave us three coconuts and we couldn’t divide them. It was embarrassing. The housekeeper’s attitude was not good when we contacted him via WeChat. He said that there were only three permissions. I asked him to apply for it, but it didn’t work. Post this, I never gave coconuts again. 3. In winter, the swimming pool and sea water are too cold for a two-year-old baby. I wanted to borrow a children's swimming ring to let the baby play in the water in the big bathtub. It took me two days to ask the housekeeper to bring it over (compare to Wanning a few days ago) The service efficiency of Le Méridien where I live is simply too low). 4. The space of Yuequ Camp for children is not well ventilated, and the smell of rubber is very strong. After playing with the children for a while, I felt a headache. There was no way. In the next few days, we went to Atlantis and the duty-free shop to pay for children's playgrounds. of. 5. The shower head in the hotel's shower room is loose and the water volume cannot be turned on to the maximum otherwise the shower head will fly up directly due to the water pressure. In addition, one morning after taking a shower, the shower room door could not be opened. It may be a little deformed. It took a long time to open it, it was so scary. 6. On the last day, because we had a lot of luggage, and except for the baby, all of us were women. Except for me, we were all elders in their 50s and 60s, so we didn’t have much physical strength. I asked the hotel staff to help carry the luggage to the car, but the guy who greeted me was reluctant and made a bad face the whole time. He kept pushing the boxes into the trunk and did not lift them up. The last two small boxes I put the stroller and the child's stroller myself. 7. How big of a brand is your reservation depar**ent? I initially wanted to negotiate a room change, but I called n times and no one answered. Ctrip called and hung up directly. Finally, I called the front desk and talked to them before they were willing to answer the phone. It took me a long time. Help with something. I have never encountered this kind of hotel service. Especially compared with other five-star hotels in Sanya, it is really bad. The service is so bad! I spent more than 60,000 just looking for punishment. Completely outrageous. Let's avoid this pitfall for everyone.

msg:This is the second time I live here, and what I want when I go out is convenience. There is a commercial plaza next to the hotel. You don't have to worry about where to eat or buy things. You can walk directly from a small path next to the hotel, which is very convenient. The hardware and services of the hotel are also amazing. Alex, the housekeeper, contacted me before I took off. He helped me upgrade the room and prepared fruit. The layout of the room was also very attentive. Children can't put it down with the animal folded in the towel. The outdoor swimming pool and slide paddling pool are children's favorites. They won't get tired after playing for a few days and nights. It's a pity that it's hard to come to Sanya once, and time can't be spent playing in the water. Apart from playing in the water, you also need to enjoy the natural scenery. It's just that it's a bit hot this day, and outdoor activities need to be done to prevent heatstroke and cool down. Fortunately, I feel that there are not many tourists in Sanya this summer, and the scenic spots are not very crowded. It's a pity that the good time always flies very fast, and the pleasant journey is about to end. Going back to make up summer homework.

msg:Room facilities:
The hotel has been around for a long time, and the maintenance is relatively good, but there is still a problem with the door of the bathroom. After reporting to the front desk, it was not resolved in time. It was not until the second response that someone was sent to open the door of the bathroom. The cloakroom is large, and there is a comfortable space to pack clothes and luggage.

breakfast:
It is said that Grand Hyatt's breakfast is great. Maybe it's because the expectations are too high, so I didn't feel too amazing. It feels like a normal hotel level, but the hotel provides a variety of fruits. The mangoes are very sweet, and the fried dumplings for breakfast are also very good. tasty.

Room view:
You can see Wuzhizhou Island in the room, and there is a large bubble pool for two people on the side of the balcony. You can take a bath here at night and watch the sea view. It should be very comfortable, but I have no experience.

swimming pool:
The swimming pool is far from the main building, but fortunately there is a shuttle bus. The size of the swimming pool is not very large, but it is sufficient, and the recreational facilities are also very rich, which is very friendly to parents and children.

Serve:
The hotel is also equipped with a butler. This time, Aiya provides butler service. Before arrival, she will contact the check-in time, arrange the room and so on. This time, my family and I did not make a reservation in the same order, but we still arranged on the first floor after informing the housekeeper, and the room was prepared on time. Every day, I will also ask about room needs and arrange room cleaning in a timely manner, which is basically responsive to requests, which is really worry-free for holiday guests.

The environment of the hotel is beautiful, one step at a time, the beach is clean, the sand is soft, there are 3 swimming pools, among which the children's pool and the family pool are very suitable for children to play in the water.
Originally booked a two-bedroom suite, but later upgraded to a parent-child two-bedroom suite, located on the 18th floor, with a beautiful sea view! The room is very big! We thoughtfully prepared all kinds of facilities that children need, and there are many dolls. Children are very happy! The kitchen is equipped with a full set of cutlery, the mini refrigerator is free of charge, and the complimentary fruit and snack plates are also delicious!
The breakfast is rich, and you need to wait for a seat during the peak period, but it will not be too long. The suite also provides daily afternoon tea and snacks before dinner in the Regency Club.
In terms of service, it is one of the best among all the hotels I have stayed in Haitang Bay. Lynn, the housekeeper, responded very quickly, and even thought of many questions in front of us!
Before leaving, Manager Qiu arranged a car for us. Seeing my daughter was a little unhappy and asked why. My daughter really likes this place so much that she doesn’t want to change hotels hahaha~ See you next time

msg:For the first time in three years, I went on vacation and chose to go to Sanya to play in the water and eat seafood. Grand Hyatt is the first hotel to choose from. The hotel location, entertainment facilities, and room style are all good. As for the shortcomings, one is that the rooms are not that new. Of course, this is normal wear and tear. The other is breakfast The richness and enthusiasm of the staff are not as good as our second hotel.
I encountered a small problem in the room during my stay, but it was solved smoothly with the help of the housekeeper KOBE, but I have to remind the hotel that the equipment still needs regular maintenance. Speaking of our butler KOBE, he is online throughout the whole process. We can always ask him for any questions. He is very caring, which is not available in the later hotels!
We are very much looking forward to coming back to Grand Hyatt in the future and relive our pleasant vacation!

On the day of check-in, the housekeeper Alax will call you in advance to ask when you will arrive, and the room will be arranged as soon as possible. Messaged my concerns right away. Sure enough, he is a careful, patient and professional butler who will help you carry your luggage to the room, and then tell you about the facilities and use of the room. I will ask about the cleaning time every day, and I will respond to requests. There were some small episodes during breakfast that were not very pleasant. Here I would like to praise the housekeeper Alax for his positive work. He immediately contacted the restaurant manager. The service attitude is very good and the efficiency is very high. The problem was successfully solved. The follow-up also followed up immediately, and it can be seen that he treats the guests seriously and sincerely. Finally, I gave the child a toy dog. Having such a serious butler adds color to the journey. The auntie who cleans this floor is also very nice. She tidies up the things I put on the sink. I feel at ease living in LaCrosse. Next time I will stay at Grand Hyatt.

msg:This hotel is the weirdest hotel I have ever stayed in! The management is extremely chaotic and speechless! The room I reserved was called by three people in succession at noon that day to ask me what time I would check in. The first person called me told me that it was not convenient to call, but the hotel continued to call me. The check-in front desk was very unskilled and it probably took half an hour to check in! One of our rooms was originally reserved for one night (the other rooms were for two nights), and I made up for one night on the spot. The reservation was completed with the front desk, but at noon the next day, the hotel called me and said that this room was for one night. Late, I have to check out today. I told him on the phone that I had made up the order yesterday and sent it to the front desk to handle it together! Ask the hotel to investigate and disagree! Just asked me the name of the person who checked in yesterday😅. I had to remember the name of the check-in person when I checked in😂! They kept talking for a long time and refused to give up. They had a bad attitude on the phone! When I returned to the hotel at noon, the room was indeed locked, and Datong coordinated to open the door again (see what kind of weird management this is)! I went back to the room to take a shower and wash my hair and found that there was no shower gel😰, which was extremely embarrassing! When the hotel cleans the room, they don't check whether there is any remaining toiletries in the bathroom toiletries jar? This is the first time I have been treated in a star-rated hotel! Notified the front desk to replenish the shower gel. The front desk was very alert and asked me for the name of the guest in the room 😂 (Are you afraid that I would use the extremely low-end toiletries?) There was an interlude during check-in. They said they would give us a free upgrade to one of the rooms, but only the upgrade. For one night, you must return to the room of the original grade for the second night😂, and you are not afraid to upset the guests! This hotel stay can be regarded as an extremely weird and wonderful trip!

I would recommend everyone to choose Grand Hyatt to start their trip to Sanya.

The highlight is the view, the room is huge, and the sea view room is the best in Haitang Bay in my opinion!
The trail leading to the beach is also beautiful, and there is a coconut tree that is very suitable for taking pictures.
The breakfast is good, I have eaten the same type for two consecutive days and I still feel that I haven't eaten enough!

The waiter Ye Mianwu takes away our used towels and replaces them with new ones every time. , Personal items are carefully placed, drinking water is replenished in time, and the attitude is very good... Another thing worth mentioning is the waiter in the western restaurant opposite the children's water park. I don't remember the name. I ordered drinks in the restaurant for two days and waited for the children. Playing, although I am the only guest, the service level has not decreased at all, and the mosquito repellent water is also thoughtfully provided, and the coffee snacks and homemade coconut balls are very good. The teachers in the Joy Camp also take care of every child in class very seriously. Very good, come back in the second half of the year, I hope Hyatt can maintain a high standard!

There was a problem with the room at the beginning, and I responded to the housekeeper Kobe, who solved the problem in a timely manner and changed the room. In fact, if you come out to play, you are not afraid of encountering problems, but you are afraid that no one will solve the problem. Grand Hyatt is quite considerate in terms of making reservations for meals, car and so on. Just let the housekeeper know. The feedback is very timely. We know that we are bringing children. , and immediately sent baby supplies. The beach is very close. There are sand digging tools for children to play on the beach. The children had a great time. To my surprise, the seafood buffet in the evening is the most comfortable meal I have eaten in the past few days. There are not many types of seafood and it is not expensive, but it is very fresh! The bottom of the small hot pot is relatively refreshing, and the children's set meal is also loved by children. We went early, and the freshly cut mangoes are really delicious. It's not the first time I've been to Sanya. I didn't expect that it was the mango of Grand Hyatt that I couldn't forget.

The executive lounge has arrangements from breakfast to afternoon tea to evening cocktails. Unfortunately, this time I have been playing with my children and have no chance to try evening cocktails. The executive lounge is less crowded and clean. I watched the sea view in the morning and had breakfast before heading home. I look forward to coming back next time.

msg:The overall experience of staying at Grand Hyatt Haitang Bay this time is very good. First of all, I would like to praise the hotel housekeeper Jessica. On the morning of the check-in day, when we were still on the way, we received a call from Jessica, who asked us about our arrival time so that we could coordinate the room in advance. When we arrived at the store to check in, the room had just been cleaned, and we could go directly to the room to rest seamlessly. Although the suite booked this time can accommodate three adults and include three breakfasts, there are only two administrative benefits. We are three adults and one child staying, and Jessica helped to give an adult an administrative courtesy for free, which is very considerate. In addition, during the three days at the hotel, Jessica would provide thoughtful and careful service information and inquire about the check-in experience at the right time. We received text messages from her on the way back after leaving the hotel. She was very dedicated. And the attitude is very kind and sincere. Her service added a lot of points to this stay experience. Secondly, the breakfast during this stay feels that the categories are more varied and the taste has improved. The last stay was in the spring and summer after the first round of the epidemic (it was also in late May, exactly three years after this stay), perhaps due to the impact of the epidemic. The breakfast was slightly inferior at that time, which is understandable. Also, during this stay, Joy Camp has reopened, and there are plenty of parent-child activities. The staff are friendly and professional, and the children had a great time. Finally, I still want to recommend the garden of Grand Hyatt Haitang Bay, which I personally think is the most layered and charming design among the hotels in Haitang Bay. The garden combines Chinese and Western artistic concepts very well, and the whole is very harmonious. It has been in operation for six or seven years, and it is still well maintained, which is not easy. The garden of a Xun family is also very beautiful. It is a pure western style, suitable for taking pictures, very photogenic, but lacks some sense of hierarchy, while the garden of Junyue is suitable for walking slowly and wandering among the water pavilions and pavilions. It seems that there is a subtle sense of Zen rippling.
The epidemic has finally passed, and the baby who was a toddler when she stayed in the hotel has grown up now... Everything is slowly getting better, and so is the hotel experience.

On the first day, he will deliver food and fruit. From time to time, he will ask you what you need to make up. The other day I said to add some water, and I immediately sent a box of water, and within two days, I came to deliver snacks and fruits. The service is considerate. At first, I thought the beach of the hotel was a bit far away compared to Yalong Bay, but there is also a car to pick you up, and such a considerate housekeeper The service is enough to make up for a little deficiency. The hotel's breakfast is also very good. It doesn't collect things after 10:30, and even fills in the fruit. The service level is in place. The room is also good, big and clean. It's almost auspicious, staying for 4 days in a row, the more I live, the more I like it.

Really super satisfied.
Last time we stayed at Yate and Yanlord. Comparing these two, I think the room type of Grand Hyatt has more advantages. It is spacious enough, the wooden floor is non-slip, the bed is big enough, and the service is also very good. It is very close to the 68 Food Street, so hot In Datian, there is a direct access to the first floor, so you don't need to bask in the sun.
I am very grateful to the housekeeper Kobe, who offered to help us delay check-out due to flight delays, otherwise I really don't know where we can go after one delay.
The service is very attentive, we will still choose here next time we come.
Thank you so much 🙏

msg:Grand Hyatt changed its usual business style in Haitang Bay and transformed into a family resort. There are really many children. Personally, I think Grand Hyatt ranks among the top brands in Shanghai Tangwan. The hotel's ground parking space is relatively sufficient, and it can also be parked underground. The building is quite grand, and there is a battery car to pick you up and drop you off to the beach, and the drive takes about five minutes. You can also call the concierge phone to call the battery car on the return journey.

Next to the hotel is the food street. The hotel can go directly to the second floor of the food street. It is protected from the sun during the day, but you must bring your room card.

Before check-in in the hotels here, the hotel housekeepers will contact you proactively, and will send you some hotel information and 5% discount coupons for duty-free shops (9.5 coupons are very useless and almost useless [laughing and crying])

The room area I booked is 100 square meters. The furniture in the room is very strong. The bathroom is really big. The wet and dry are separated. The water output of the shower is also good. The bathrobe is a light summer style, and it doesn’t get hot when you put it on after taking a shower. The room’s The balcony is spacious and has a great view.

Breakfast adheres to the rich variety of the Hyatt Depar**ent, and there are three dining areas. There are a lot of people at 9 o'clock in the morning. After the May Day holiday, there is still a queue for breakfast [cover your face]

The resort hotel feels more suitable for bringing children. The projects suitable for adults are less fun, and the swimming pool is only 1.2 meters. Compared with the Grand Hyatt Macau swimming pool, it is a bit disappointing. Haitang Bay has a lot of waves here, and you can't go into the sea.
Finally, I would like to thank the lady at the front desk of the Recreation Center. I saw the doll my friend liked on the doll machine at the entrance of the coffee shop, but the position of the doll was difficult to grasp. In the end, it was all thanks to the lady to help me adjust the position, and finally returned with satisfaction.

msg:For four days and three nights, I had a more in-depth experience of Grand Hyatt. The first thing to praise is the catering. The service and quality are relatively in place. Although it is not amazing, the sense of quality is online. Especially the pyrotechnics made by the chef in a small pot on site, which can be seen in every Hyatt hotel.

The "butler service" can maintain good communication with guests, and quickly reduce the negative impact of other links falling off the chain, which is very good. It's just that there are many places that shouldn't be dropped, and I hope that the work will be done in place in the future in order to give guests a complete and wonderful experience.

The design of the hotel is very careful. The Chinese-style sunken hydrophilic courtyard is very beautiful, but the way from the swimming pool to the guest room is a little bit longer. We live in the south building, so we simply walk through the side door on the second floor on the south side, so we don't have to make a fuss. Although there is a battery car in the lobby, the distance to the lobby is equivalent to half the way to the swimming pool. So if you have the opportunity, you can still experience the swimming pool room on the second floor of the south building. The entire south building is designed with high ceilings, and even the second floor is not depressing. The swimming pool room in the north building is one floor lower than the altitude.

The lifeguard on the south side of the family swimming pool has a sense of responsibility. They are keenly aware of the risk of young children wearing lifebuoys slipping by the second-floor infinity pool, and have repeatedly blown whistles to warn parents. Responsibility and risk awareness are part of the job, and what guests see is a sense of security and a good impression of the hotel.

Finally, I hope that some charging piles can be installed in the parking lot, and it will be more convenient to rent new energy vehicles.

msg:At first, Grand Hyatt Haitang Bay was chosen because of its beautiful coconut groves and lawns. But after soaking in the hotel deeply, I found that it is a treasure family hotel.
It really prepares enough and rich and interesting activities for children. Although they only stayed in the hotel for one day, the two children played in the water world all morning. After lunch, they clocked in 3 outdoor activities, namely ziplines, building shelters, and drilling wood to make fire. The indoor activities of Joy Camp and The cute pet paradise has no time to take care of it at all, so high that it has been exposed to the sun for a day in the high temperature of 32 degrees + without any complaints
Of course, the service of the front desk and the butler is really nothing to say. When I encountered an order fee problem during check-in, Shasha Wang at the front desk was very enthusiastic and actively gave me a solution, which did not affect the check-in at all. The housekeeper, Kobe, actively communicated with me and solved the subtleties of checking in the room, cleaning and adding supplies, and the check-in experience was very smooth.
The only shortcoming is to catch up with the decoration of the restaurant and not be able to experience it in the original restaurant.
In short, I will choose Grand Hyatt next time I come to Haitang Bay.

The design of the hotel everywhere is very friendly, and everything is very convenient and at ease! Second, the hotel does not make people feel crowded and noisy.

Thirdly, the hotel staff have a strong sense of service, they are responsive to every request with smiling faces, and the response speed is extremely fast! Especially our dear butler Alex, who is handsome and sunny, the key is to meet our various needs tirelessly.

It didn't affect the mood and itinerary at all. The hotel staff are very friendly and sweet! The facilities are top-notch, the mattresses are very comfortable and enjoyable, the room including the floor drain has no peculiar smell, the sea view is charming, and the restaurant dishes are delicious and authentic.

The overall service of the hotel is very good, the facilities are complete, the daily buffet breakfast is very rich, the hotel has its own beach, which is very clean and there are not many people, and the outdoor children's pool has children I was very happy to play, and I felt deeply about the hotel butler service. The butler Alex contacted us in advance before we checked in, and sent out the hotel precautions, information about duty-free shops and coupons in advance for travel. Communicate the cleaning time of the room in time, and give fruit and snacks as gifts. The service is very considerate and in place. The elderly in the family are very satisfied, and will choose to stay in Grand Hyatt in the future.

It feels like a hotel hidden in a tropical forest. This time I stayed in the supreme sea view room in the main building. The room is huge and the sea view is super good! The breakfast here is super rich and delicious. I am also very grateful to the butler Daisy for her attentive and warm service. She greets you with care every day, and sends fresh fruit plates and snacks every day, as well as a lot of drinks. There is also a food court next to the hotel. I ate seafood and barbecue on the first night. It is a few minutes walk and the traffic is very convenient.

My daughter complained that the bathtub at home was too small. In addition, I think the service of this hotel is still great. The housekeeper Aiya is very attentive. She confirmed some information with me before I left. Because I confirmed the sea view room on ** for the other three nights, she helped me upgrade the room for the first night in advance. All of them were sea view rooms, which saved the trouble of adjusting the room. Because I was with a child, she also helped me prepare children's supplies and extra beds in advance, and I slept very comfortably. Every day, she took the initiative to confirm with me what needed to be supplemented and whether the bedding needed to be changed. The response was very timely. The hotel's food was average. I would like to make a small suggestion. I hope that the welcome fruit can be replaced with coconuts with logos, which would be more meaningful. Haha, but I was very happy to drink it before leaving. To be honest, the buffet breakfast and the buffet hot pot were not delicious, but the last simple meal was not bad. It was one of the few Hainan delicacies that were full and delicious. Haha. In addition, the children's activities in Yuequ Camp are great, and the teachers are very patient. If the children are not bored, don't go to crowded attractions.

msg:I chose a lot of hotels when I booked, read a lot of reviews, and recommended this hotel with many good reviews. I chose Grand Hyatt with a mentality of giving it a try. The hotel introduced that it opened in 2016, but when I entered the hotel, the concierge welcomed me very warmly At the same time, I also found that the public area of the hotel is well maintained. The marble floor and walls are almost showing people's shadows. It is not at all like a hotel that has been open for 7-8 years. The whole is very grand. The check-in at the front desk is very efficient. Although it is very busy, it still maintains a smiling and patient reception. It is very nice, and the butler service is also very good. It will contact me a few days in advance, tracking service, 365-degree service without dead ends, which is unexpected Meticulous, very good feeling! The room was cleaned very cleanly. I can’t find anything wrong with the cleanliness. The room service responds quickly and is responsive. One of the photos shows the room manager Hebe personally coming to deliver drinks to us. Although I don’t remember the appearance, it’s special kind! Since we only stayed for one night, a lot of dirty clothes needed to be washed, and the laundry room helped us expedite them. The clothes were ironed and sent back to the room early the next morning, which was beyond imagination! The breakfast at the Regency Club is good, and the young lady there is also warm and friendly. They offered to bake bread for us and make coffee for us. Every time we met, we bowed and greeted each other. It's really great! For me who come to Sanya at least twice a year, Grand Hyatt is really one of the best high-quality hotels in Haitang Bay. Here I would like to praise James at the front desk, Alex the housekeeper, May at the Regency Club, and Ms. Coco, the housekeeping supervisor, for their help and service. I left in a hurry, and there are many friends who have served me. I didn’t remember the names. It’s okay. I remember Grand Hyatt, which means I also remember you.

There are many green plants in the public area that are not afraid of the sun. The coconut grove lawn is a big shot. We took a lot of photos Ha ha. The most important thing is that the hotel has upgraded the room type. The housekeeper Alex is thoughtful and considerate. Thank you very much.

msg:I think the good impression of this stay is mainly due to the heated swimming pool and the service... Butler Andre helped arrange the whole process very well, so there is still a just right comfortable experience when the occupancy rate is relatively high. Overall, the hotel still feels that it is more suitable for parents and children, and many projects are designed with family characteristics.

Facilities: The room type looks at the sea and the location is very good. You can watch the sunrise in the morning. The room is quite large and has a walk-in changing room, which is very convenient for drying clothes. The bed is also relatively comfortable. The bathroom and shower room are well sealed. There are two rooms There is a small sofa, there are tables on the balcony and in the house, all the furnishings can be used and the movement is convenient. The rest time at night is quite quiet, and the sound insulation is better than I imagined. In other words, I hope to add a coffee machine in the future.

Hygiene: Neat and clean, no stains, and the details are handled quite well.

Environment: Stepping into the hotel lobby, it feels like a business-oriented one. The garden part towards the beach is very neat, and the green plants are well-matched. I think it is the kind that has been taken care of carefully, without large messy water stains or fallen leaves. The small pond over the Chinese restaurant will also have water mist in the morning to create an a**osphere. The water temperature of the constant temperature swimming pool is very suitable, the water quality is also good, and the landscape layout of the road to the beach is also very beautiful.

Service: To be honest, there are quite a lot of people staying here. This is the first time I have seen the long queue during the peak meal time in the morning... The service in the public area is quite satisfactory. , I can also understand because I really can't take care of it. The special butler service really adds a lot of points. It also improves the travel experience for people like me who like to be quiet. The room type upgrade, late check-out, various reminders and room service are all available. In addition, the room is equipped with welcome nuts It's delicious with small biscuits...

To sum up, family trips are still recommended, and you can also feed cute ducklings. In addition, in Haitang Bay, you should choose a more positive room type to see the sea and the price is super high.

Service: There is nothing to say about the service. Although there was water left on the mopping floor in the lobby, which caused me to fall, the waiter didn't go to help me up, but everything else was good. I might go there again next time! After playing in the swimming pool, call the front desk and there will be a sightseeing car delivered to the residence, very convenient!

The location of the hotel is very good, you can walk to the food street in five minutes. The only thing that can be improved is that it is recommended to take care of the beach a little bit. Although it is a public beach, everyone should sweep the snow in front of the door by themselves. You don’t need to arrange beach chairs or anything, but it’s best to clean up the garbage washed up by the waves every day.

Facilities: Chinese-style housing design, two bathrooms, two bathtubs, one on the balcony, two large balconies, my father is unwilling to go out, just watch the sea view and play on the phone on the balcony

Environment: Very good, the park is very large, there are adult pools and children's pools, and the beach is slightly smaller.
Service: Very good, especially the butler service.
To sum up, next time I have the opportunity to go to Sanya, Grand Hyatt will definitely be the first choice. Fortunately, I stayed at Grand Hyatt for the first three days, and I chose to experience Yate on the last day, otherwise this trip will be very regrettable!

msg:I stayed in this hotel 3 years ago, and I was considering exploring new hotels, but I was afraid of stepping into the trap, so I decided to stay again. The service environment is still as good as ever! Especially with children, I chose the swimming pool room on the first floor, which is simply amazing! The kids are having fun while soaking in the pool! Not coming out at all, other playhouse items don't need to go at all. Compared with the last stay, the most obvious change is that the hotel's service awareness has become stronger, and parent-child services have increased. Almost every service staff passing by will take the initiative to say hello. Every shared pool is equipped with lifeguards, and a couple have been added. A butler service. When choosing a hotel, I also read many online reviews that the hotel generally reported that the butler service only adds WeChat and does not respond. I was prepared for the fact that the butler would not be able to respond, but unexpectedly, the feeling of staying this time is really good Before leaving, the housekeeper Aiya asked about the needs in advance. The toiletries for the children, welcome fruits, snacks, and extra beds were properly arranged. The swimming pool in the room was also equipped with a pink flamingo air cushion. Swimming Swimming rings, sand digging tools, everything, which has never been done before, and almost every parent-child detail has been thought of! After a few days, the butler, Aiya, was almost on call. The drinks, fruits and cleaning were arranged in a timely manner every day. In particular, one time in the middle, in order to be close to the restaurant, I specially asked for a room change, and the coordination was arranged quickly. , When we came back from the beach, all the luggage and supplies were brought to the new room, the specific swimming ring requested by the child was also inflated and replaced, and the drinks were replaced with the child's favorite flavor. It was really efficient and thoughtful! Like 👍. In addition, the hotel has a rich breakfast, but you need to queue for more than ten minutes during peak hours around 9 o'clock, but the order is very good, and the dishes are replenished in a timely manner. In addition, the best thing is that the hotel is next to the 68 Food Street, 2-3 minutes walk from the room It's here. It's suitable for parent-child families who like to lie flat for vacation and enjoy the shade of trees. They especially want to live in a swimming pool room. The room size is suitable and the layout is reasonable.

Tell me about your stay experience
Location: Both hotels are very good, very close to duty-free shops
Room: Grand Hyatt’s sea view rooms are up to the 16th floor, and Marriott’s is on the 4th floor. Of course, the Grand Hyatt has a better view of the sea view, and the detailed service in the room is better than that of JW Marriott, and Marriott’s electronically controlled lights and curtains. LaCrosse’s toiletries are comparable to five-star hotels It doesn't match. Marriott does a better job in this regard. It provides Parma cleansing and care, and also gives Estee Lauder Platinum Cream as a gift. The details are perfect 💯
Breakfast: Grand Hyatt's breakfast service is average, the food tastes good, and the sanitation is pretty good, especially the disinfection work. The restaurant is chaotic after nine o'clock. You can advance or postpone it
Privacy: Grand Hyatt has a relatively large passenger flow, and the front desk reception 🆚 is still a little worse than JW Marriott. Marriott has 160 rooms and a total of 4 floors. I feel that all aspects of service are better, except that the sea view in the room is not particularly ideal.
Overall, it's okay, but the service still needs to be improved. In particular, I suggest that the toiletries and check-in need to be improved.

Hygiene: The towels and bedding are very clean, and the quilt and pillow are very comfortable. Parents say it is better than the one at home.

Facilities: The room and bathroom are very large. Although it is not a sea view room, you can see the sea and the sunset from the balcony. The facilities need to lose points because the decoration is a bit old, the sliding doors of the balcony and bathroom are very heavy, and it takes a lot of effort to open and close☹️There is no handle inside the glass door of the bathroom, and the old man's finger will be caught by the door if he moves slowly😭

Generally speaking, Grand Hyatt is a very good resort hotel, and I will choose it again next time I come to Haitang Bay.

The butler Aiya's service is great and considerate. The staff is very polite and will take the initiative to care about cleaning or replenishing needed supplies. The breakfast is very rich, the Hou'an powder is super authentic, and there are all kinds of snacks and desserts. The sea view here is also very good. I took a photo of my favorite beach sunrise. There are not too many people, and the view will not be disturbed. I had a very happy holiday, I ate well and slept soundly. I have just left and I am already looking forward to coming again~

msg:The greening of the Grand Hyatt is very good. The entire large botanical garden design makes it very comfortable to take a walk in the hotel. I have been to Sanya four or five times, and stayed in many five-star hotels before and after. Grand Hyatt highly recommends it! The breakfast and seafood buffet dinner were very good. The service of the butler Aiya is also very good, responsive to every request! Very recommended! The fly in the oin**ent is that there is a lack of thatched huts on the beach where you can lie down and rest. I lived in St. Regis before, and the thatched huts on the beach are great for lying down and watching the sea.

msg:It is said that coming to Haitang Bay is to play hotels, so I chose Grand Hyatt, and it turns out that I really made the right choice! Let’s talk about catering first. The hotel’s breakfast has a wide variety of items, and the included afternoon tea is also very good. In terms of portion size, it feels like it’s not afternoon tea for two but three people. It’s amazing! Then in terms of the hotel’s facilities and equipment, the room type we chose has an Internet celebrity bathtub. It’s really relaxing to soak in the bath and watch the sea, which is super amazing. I especially like the hotel's spare parts, the smell is really good, and it is very pleasant to sit on the terrace and enjoy the sea breeze! The last is the service. Every staff member will greet you when they see it. I really feel very warm. I must praise Alin in the front hall by name. He is really super patient, careful and warm-hearted. He introduced the hotel facilities in detail, helped us to make an appoin**ent for afternoon tea, and answered us patiently. He helped us to recommend nearby food, and asked us about our stay experience when we left the store. It can be said that we met the most caring staff during this trip. Next time I have a chance, I will continue to choose Grand Hyatt!

msg:It can be said that it is a stay experience that is worth looking forward to and full of surprises!
Location:
Located in Haitang Bay, adjacent to the Food City, it is very convenient for shopping and eating.
environment:
Wide, grass, beach, entertainment, swimming pool (and constant temperature) are abundant.
Room view:
Simply invincible! It’s nearly 60 floors from the Atlantis where I lived before. The view is more upright, the elevator is faster, and I don’t have to wait for a long time. The most attractive thing is the bathtub with sea view. When it is in place, you can see the 180-degree sea view without any obstruction.
Room facilities:
There are many exquisite small ideas, such as the desk, the porch, the connection between the open balcony and the bathtub with a view, the chaise longue on the balcony, the electric curtain for privacy guarantee, and the long mirror in the shower room, which are designed and practical.
breakfast:
There are too many people, but it is worth it, the environment is still very good, the variety of dishes is very rich, taking into account the tastes of many places, and the special Hainan Baoluo noodles are also delicious!
health:
Praise the room attendant Zhong Dong for tidying up very cleanly, and he read all the comments carefully!
Cost performance:
I spent a very special day in Grand Hyatt, overall 🈵️ points! Personally, I think it is better than Capella in terms of location, design, and service. It is recommended by pragmatists, and I will come again next time!

msg:This is the first time I stayed at Grand Hyatt Haitang Bay. Because I have two children, I booked a famous parent-child hotel when I came to Hainan several times before. In my impression, Grand Hyatt is more business and casual. This time I also like the sea view of the room. The big bathtub was only decided, but it surprised me. The hotel management is very good. Although the occupancy rate is high, it doesn't feel messy. The breakfast is also very continuous, and there has never been a queue or shortage of ingredients when picking up the meal. The other thing is the hotel's Joy Camp, which is very suitable for my two children. Children aged 5-12 can make an appoin**ent. The activities are different every day. From morning to night, the children have a great time playing. In addition, there is the children's swimming pool at the wine point. The height of the water slide is very suitable, and the water in the pool is only 30cm deep. For children over 5 years old, parents can safely accompany them on the shore without going into the water. What's more, next to the hotel is the 68 food street, and there is also a supermarket, which is very convenient. There are KFC and Pizza Hut, and the price is the same as other stores, which is very convenient. When the baby was hungry, he went downstairs to pack and buy a sea view meal in the room. The butler service is also very considerate. On the last day we left the store, we made an appoin**ent for the children to climb trees in the morning, which ended at 12 o'clock. The butler thoughtfully delayed our check-out until 2 o'clock, so that the children could take a bath comfortably. In short, I will recommend it to my friends, it is really a treasure family hotel.

msg:To be honest, I was a little apprehensive about choosing Grand Hyatt at first, but I was very pleasantly surprised after checking in. When we got off the bus, the handsome guy at the concierge helped us take our luggage to the front desk neatly. The lady at the front desk was very gentle, and the little brother was very patient, and would help me figure out how to get a deal. The breakfast was comparable to Capella, but the service beat Capella. Compared with other hotels such as Sunny Bay and Haitang Bay, the room service is really good. Slippers and blankets are delivered quickly, and there is no delay due to the peak season. I stayed for three nights and received calls in the afternoon of two days asking if I wanted them Adding items, the night before I left, I asked me if I needed some more soft drinks, compared to Westin who chased me because of a can of Coke and kept calling me after I went home to work (not mine Because of the reason, it is also clear that the bill is free when leaving the store), and the staff actively asks whether the minibar is complete, which shows that the management of Grand Hyatt is very online! It feels very majestic, unlike some hotels that are stingy! The housekeeper, Aiya, informed you all the precautions in advance. The work is efficient and saves everyone's communication time. Even in the peak season, he actively asks if you need to delay check-out, which is very considerate! It will definitely be a second-brush hotel, and I hope it can be maintained forever! ! !

Worth encouraging! From the room facilities to the service level, it maintains a high standard. It can be regarded as a treasure hotel, and it is highly recommended! Especially compared with the surrounding hotels, I think it is second only to Edison. Atlantis is too noisy, Yanlord Crown occupies too small an area, and the mangroves are too broken. The most disappointing thing is Rosewood, which completely broke my good impression of it in Guangzhou Rosewood. In a comprehensive comparison, Grand Hyatt is more and more superior. worth it!

On the whole, it’s okay, but the details need to be improved. For example, the floor of the room is not cleaned thoroughly, hand towels are not placed, and the hotel deposit is not refunded in time.

msg:After the epidemic, I temporarily decided to come out to play. I lived in Atlantis in Haitang Bay, and Crowne Plaza Yanlord. Due to the crazy price rise, I chose the Grand Hyatt Hotel. I decided to extend the room as soon as I checked in. The room is really good, although the room is full. rooms, because the flow of people is scattered in three buildings, so there are not as many rooms in the hotel as Yate Renheng. This is my favorite. We live behind the South Building and walk directly to the 68 Food Street. It is very convenient for eating and shopping.
Parent-child: The activities are super awesome. Now is the peak season and you need to make an appoin**ent in advance. There are different parent-child activities every day. You can refer to the hotel's parent-child activity table to make an appoin**ent in advance. Children can live here for a week without being lonely.
Daily family activities are very rich and different.
Room: The room is very comfortable, especially the view of the sea from the south building is very good. There is a sofa at the entrance, a sofa and a table in the hall, and a table and sofa outside to see the sea. This is very, very comfortable, and the bathroom is also very comfortable. The big, square bathtub can see the sea view and soak in the bath, which is very eye-catching [呲牙] The refrigerator mini bar in the room is free every day, and fruit and snack plates will be delivered.
Swimming pool: There is only one children's pool with constant temperature in the swimming pool. It is relatively shallow and there are slides for children to play, which is similar to Yanlord's children's pool. The adult swimming pool is heated and has no smell of disinfectant, but the color doesn't look particularly good. The swimming pool recommends Atlantis, I really can soak for a day.
Service: The hotels in Haitang Bay have butler service, but the best butler service of these is the Grand Hyatt Hotel. My butler is mia, she is very kind, she will help you make appoin**ents for your son's activities every day, remind you of meal times, and is a responsive angel baby. If you come here, you must find her to experience the feeling of double happiness. The Atlantis butler is worse. I still have a room in the Royal Club, and the full room service is completely different. The butler of Yanlord Crowne Plaza is also good, but it is still the most meticulous of Grand Hyatt. The experience was very good when the room was extended three times. The lady at the front desk who checks in is called sugar. She is not kind, because the angel baby in this hotel I want to stay forever, but the price ranges from 1677 to 2291 every day. in price increases. It is recommended that babies who bring children to play stay in a hotel all the time, and check-out and check-in basically waste most of the day. And more and more luggage [crying]
Beach: The hotels are all connected to the beach. You can also walk or call a battery car. The beach buggy costs 160 yuan, and you can play for 10 minutes. However, the car is average. Because the beach is uneven, people follow it. It's cool to drive.
For travel photography, I recommend Crowne Plaza Yanlord, which has costumes and make-up, and the service is very good.
Haitang Bay parent-child hotel recommends Grand Hyatt Hotel.

The room has prepared children's bathrobes, toiletries, and dolls in advance ~ all kinds of recreational facilities are available, freeing parents ~ the water quality of the outdoor swimming pool is clear ~ there are corresponding service personnel to provide services ~ I booked for one night at the time, and the children didn't have enough fun. Stayed one more night. All aspects of experience have made us feel at home! Finally, let’s talk about the variety of breakfast dishes
Rich, many choices, very thoughtful preparation of children's disinfection tableware.
I have eaten at a Chinese restaurant once before, but I have never lived in it. This time, due to the unblocking of the epidemic, my family chose Grand Hyatt Haitang Bay as the first hotel in Sanya. It really brought me a big surprise because the hotel is close to the sea, children can dig sand, and there is a children's playground inside the hotel.
Facilities: It is an old-fashioned hotel style, and the room decoration is very old. Because it is close to the sea, it is a little bit humid.
Hygiene: The cleaning is very clean. If you choose to clean when you go out, the room will look brand new when you come back.
Environment: The overall environment is very good, there is also an amusement park for children, but it is more suitable for 3-6 babies
Service: There is really nothing to say about the service. In a five-star hotel, there was a little problem during check-in. A very beautiful manager, May, came to help change the room. Because my luggage was very messy, Carson, a handsome guy at the concierge depar**ent, worked hard to help with my luggage.
So thoughtful. Thanks to May and Carson for their help during their stay. I will continue to choose the Grand Hyatt Sanya Haitang Bay Hotel next time I come to Sanya. I will also strongly recommend it to friends and family around me.
Service: Strong praise

msg:This is the third time I have stayed at the Grand Hyatt in two years, and it is already my must-stay hotel in Sanya. Advantages: In addition to the good management of chain international brand hotels, 1. The location is superior, close to the duty-free shop, and a taxi costs more than ten yuan. 2. It is next to the food street, and it is convenient to eat. There is a seafood supermarket in the food street, and the seafood is fresh and cheap . It can be processed by the hotel after purchasing. 3. There are indoor children's playgrounds and outdoor water parks. Children aged 0-18 can find suitable projects. The hotel arranges a lot of activities, but they need to be over four years old to participate. 4. The hotel room space is large , The family room fully meets the living needs of a family with two children and two children, and breakfast is free for children under 12 years old. 5. Equipped with one-to-one butler, our butler Lynn is very nice and provides a lot of help. In short, I will still choose to stay at Grand Hyatt next time.

msg:Since the epidemic began in early 2020, this is my fourth trip to Sanya and I have stayed in more than a dozen hotels. In this special case, only Sanya is the safest.
The Grand Hyatt is generally good. Check-in on December 16th is more than 1400 yuan including breakfast. The hotel's various facilities are open from morning to night, obviously ready to welcome guests.
We lived in a double room with sea view. The room is spacious and beautiful, but the decoration materials are not good.
Personally, I think the highlight of the hotel is that there are many swimming pools, which are very beautiful and very clean. There are various massage facilities in the swimming pool, although no one is playing, the hotel is open from morning till night. The outdoor heated swimming pool is very good. You can swim to your heart's content in winter. It is especially useful for those of us who like to swim. The outdoor swimming pool reassures guests during the epidemic. There are also two similar small water parks for children, but there are no people, which is a pity. It may be caused by the cold weather or the epidemic. People are afraid to leave the room? Maybe people go shopping at the duty-free shop next door.
We stayed in the sea view suite on the second day, more than 100 square meters, balcony sea view room, more than 2700 yuan including breakfast.
The room is very spacious. But there is a wall in the middle of the balcony. This design is too bad. I live in this house just to stand on the balcony and have a wide view, but I don’t feel this way at all. This is a bad review. There is a bathtub on the balcony, and you can enjoy the sea view while soaking in the bath. The suite offers afternoon tea and evening cocktails.
Breakfast is available both indoors and outdoors. We eat it outside, which is very safe and will not be infected with the virus. This is one of the main reasons why we have chosen to come to Sanya for vacation in the past three years.
I took a look at the hotel's gym. The facilities are very good, and the floor-to-ceiling doors can be opened for ventilation, which is good.
The restaurant by the pool has a good mood, so I didn't eat it.
Overall, the hotel has a high-end a**osphere and a reasonable price-performance ratio. Recommended to stay.
Finally, I would like to praise the housekeeper Aiya for her caring and considerate service.

The complimentary buffet dinner is superb, and the breakfast is complete and delicious. The activities of the club made my son fall in love with it even more. Yona, the hotel housekeeper, is very considerate. She contacted us before check-in to communicate our needs. She printed homework for the children and sent them to the room. On Chris**as Eve, she gave gifts to the children in the room and delayed check-out for us. It made me feel very comfortable here warmth! Will live here next time!

msg:Every time I come to Sanya, as long as I go to Haitang Bay, I will stay at Grand Hyatt. This hotel is especially suitable for purely exclusive families. The swimming pool is kept at constant temperature. There is a large dense jungle planted between the hotel and the beach, and the garden landscape design is very beautiful. The hotel's restaurant is of a standard five-star quality, whether it is breakfast or the ingredients of the Chinese restaurant. The housekeeper Alex arranged by the hotel this time is very professional. I had already contacted me on WeChat before I arrived in Sanya. After checking in, I greeted my body every day, which made our family feel very warm. When the epidemic is raging like this, I even bother to provide on-demand services. It embodies the value-added service of a five-star hotel. Recently, many friends in Beijing are planning to go to Sanya for vacation, and I also recommend them to choose Grand Hyatt, hoping that Grand Hyatt can make persistent efforts to maintain the quality of service. By the way, there are two highlights of the hotel that I like. 1. You can see a white horse on the beach of the hotel, either Prince Ha or a white horse; 2. The hotel has sugar-free fresh cream for breakfast, which allows me to make my own sugar-free cream every morning Dessert.

Thanks to Ms. May Chen in the front hall. She is fair, beautiful and has long legs. She upgraded me to a sea view room with gentleness and thoughtfulness. When I get up every day and open the curtains, it is really great to see such a beautiful sea view. You can see it from the balcony of the hotel. At sunrise, the check-in experience is greatly enhanced!
The hotel has a large area, right by the sea, within a few steps. There is also a large lawn that looks great for taking pictures. There are swimming pools, gyms, children's playgrounds, etc. It is very suitable for vacation. If you are not in a hurry, you really want to stay for a long time. The room is big and clean, the bathroom is separated from wet and dry, there are all kinds of drinks, beer, snacks, coffee, tea...all are provided for free, especially a large bucket of mineral water, it is really friendly to those who love to drink water, the room attendant is very friendly Careful, I stayed for three days, and came back from playing every day. I feel better when I see a clean and tidy room. The clothes I randomly throw on the sofa will be folded, and a bath towel will be placed under it. The cosmetics will also be neatly arranged for me. Humanized hotels are really rare. The buffet breakfast is also very good, with everything from Chinese and Western styles, and the supply time is also very long, meeting the different needs of guests.
In short, the experience is satisfactory, the wall is cracked and recommended, never step on the thunder! ! !

The first thing that made me feel very warm was that the hotel management contacted me before I checked in, confirmed the time with me and asked if I had any other needs, etc. When I arrived at the hotel, she was waiting for us in the lobby. She sent us to the room from the beginning to the end and introduced all the children's activities in the hotel. The swimming pool room is really beautiful. The house is very big and comfortable to live in. What touched me the most was the butler Aiya. I met the best butler in Sanya, responsive and very high-quality, next time I come to this hotel, it must be the first choice

When I arrived at the hotel, the room was not packed yet, so I sent a car to the 68 food street next to it. In fact, it was only two steps away until I knew it was cooked.
The room is very large, and the housekeeper Alex helped to upgrade to a high floor with a good view. The bathtub faces the sea, and it is very pleasant to take a bath. It's also good to sit on the balcony sofa and enjoy the sea breeze.

The hotel is very big, with three swimming pools, lawns, and beaches. It's just that the temperature has cooled down in the past two days and I didn't go swimming.

The breakfast is also good, Chinese and Western, with small changes every day.

Not far from duty-free shops and restaurants, a few minutes by car.

It is also worth mentioning that the pick-up staff at the entrance of the hotel is simply a leader in lowering the overall service. I feel that I am more polite than him as a guest. I didn’t know it when I went there for the first time. I thought I entered the building and borrowed the parking lot. The attitude of being defiant, playing with the mobile phone to see us coming and walking, even my boyfriend first said that we are passengers staying in the hotel, and when we came back that night, we were directly murdered, because we wanted to go in and see if there was a place in the open air, The first time we entered the underground parking lot, we didn't find the elevator entrance. The original words are, let's go in and have a look, if it doesn't come out right away, well, the whole process is very polite, he just has no manners, and in the end he even said, don't stop randomly. As a result, there are not only seats, but also Inexplicably, it made us seem to be very unqualified and didn't listen to him.

The room is not a smart TV, you can only watch TV, and you can't cast the screen, which is a minus.
The housekeeper Mia has a good service attitude and is very efficient. After the first day of check-in, I felt that the bed in the room was too wet, and took the initiative to help us replace the suite with the sun. There were changes to the flight on the last day, and we also agreed to delay our check-out until 17.00. Five-star praise

The trip that was supposed to be completed by the end of August was dragged to October by the epidemic. I have stayed in many hotels in Haitang Bay, including the higher-end Rosewood and The Edison, and I stayed at the Grand Hyatt with a try attitude, which was unexpectedly in line with expectations. Upgraded sea view room, plentiful refreshments and fruits, open mini bar, beautiful sandy beach, well-maintained garden, refreshing swimming pool, what more can you expect? And of course the warm and friendly housekeeper Aiya, who didn't stay long but was well looked after by her!

The room space is very large, each room type is different, the hotel park is also very large, there are multiple swimming pools, it is also very close to the sea, afternoon tea is also delicious, and there is a game room for children to play. Before enjoying the park facilities, you can inform the hotel in advance to arrange a shuttle bus to the beach or swimming pool. Butler Aiya's service is very attentive. He will contact customers in advance and make arrangements according to customer requirements. Combined with the epidemic situation, he will also inform the nearby nucleic acid points and testing time in advance. The service is great.

After check-in, a small fruit plate was given away. There was a free delay of 2 hours when checking out. You can contact him when you go to the beach. You can pick him up in a small battery car, and you can also deliver it to duty-free shops. But because we rented a car, we didn’t have to pick him up when we went out.
Environment: The environment is very good, the room type we chose is a private pool room, and there is a little duck that is very good~ I experienced the feeling of having a swimming pool at home~
Hygiene: Very clean, and the cleaning products are pretty good~
I think the only shortcoming is the breakfast, maybe because there are fewer people, the richness of the breakfast is a bit lacking.
Anyway, it's still good~

msg:After the National Day holiday, I took a holiday on a staggered peak. I traveled from Sanya Bay to Xiaodonghai all the way to Haitang Bay. I chose to stay in the sea view suite of the Grand Hyatt Haitang Bay. The real scene of the suite is more beautiful than the one on Ctrip. With a long view of the sea, the oversized bathtub on the balcony can watch the sunrise while taking a bath. The executive benefits provided by the suite include afternoon tea and evening cocktail party, both of which can be eaten and drunk. The ordinary sea view room plus these courtesy services are more than the price of the suite, which is very cost-effective.
In addition, I have to praise the housekeeper Alex, the service is super invincible! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Reviews! Any requirements will be exceeded. In addition, the hotel is a short distance from the beach. I told the housekeeper in advance that it will be picked up by car. When you come to Haitang Bay for vacation, Grand Hyatt is strongly recommended!

She sent a lot of bottles of water, and even wrote a message. Very enthusiastic . Although the facilities of the hotel are relatively old, it is fortunate that it is relatively complete and can respond to the requirements of the guests. Really good! And his breakfast is very good. It's a 2-minute walk from 68 Food City, which is so convenient! The beach of this hotel is also very clean, and the seaside travel photography is complete. It's a reasonably priced hotel.

msg:Advantages: Shute is more like a rainforest, but there are no lights at night, which is a bit scary; it is close to the 68 food street, so it is convenient to eat; there are many life jackets in the swimming ring, just take it. Disadvantages: what to say, 1. Grand Hyatt guest room, the glass between the guest room and the bathtub, no curtains, the room is extremely bright at five or six in the morning, am I still here for vacation? If you really have curtains in this location, is it necessary to hide them so well that guests can't find them? 2. The room looks a little old, it's ok, but there is mildew in the bathroom alcove? 3. There are a total of 3 swimming pools, all of which are small, and only the adult swimming pool is heated, and the children's swimming pool and the parent-child swimming pool are cold water. 4. The parent-child swimming pool is very small. There is no cushion between the small slide and the tiles at the bottom of the pool. There is a gap of several centimeters. My tailbone still hurts for several days. The big slide of the parent-child swimming pool, the nails are rusted, and many nails are exposed. You can rest assured that you are not afraid of losing money. 5. The waiter's attitude was very good, but at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, I found that the stains on the quilt were not made by me. I called for a new quilt, and it took me an hour to deliver it after several calls. 6. The display screen of the room air conditioner is a mystery, and it will not be used at all. Who knows if your F0 is off and F1 is on? Shouldn't there be a manual? I asked the waiter what was showing and I could tell if it was on or not. Waiter: You can't tell, you can only listen to the sound. ? ? ? 7. Is the room phone so complicated? If you don't know how to use it, call a waiter and tell me to press the speakerphone and then press 0 to find the front desk. If you find other depar**ents, let the front desk transfer. Any buttons on the phone such as guest service concierge are useless. I said I don't want to be hands-free? Waiter: Then I won't. 8. The duty-free shop bus of a hotel I stayed in before is its own, and there is a bus every half an hour. Grand Hyatt is a duty-free shop bus and must be reserved before 20:00 one day in advance. I'm on vacation, do I need to schedule it so tightly? 9. The breakfast is not worth 50. It is not like the breakfast in more than 2,000 hotels. There are few choices and the place is small. The most exaggerated thing is that the cheese, yogurt, western sausage and salted fish are all put in the freezer for the waiter. ? One of the ingredients for the waffle is missing, I said to get it, and I took it for half an hour. If you don't want anyone to eat it, just say it directly 10. On the day of check-out, the duty-free shop bus was originally booked at 10:10, but the duty-free shop was closed. The front desk called the guest room after 9:00 and told me that there was no bus. You obviously have a housekeeper who added me on WeChat, can't you post a message, you called me after nine o'clock when you were on vacation and said this kind of thing that I can know without waking me up with a WeChat? 11. The humidity in the main building where I live is not bad. My friend said that the south building where I live is too humid and there are ants in the room. 12. Summary: In short, I will never live in Grand Hyatt again, even if I give it money! I really don't know what the hearts of people who recommend Junyue are. It is recommended that Grand Hyatt spend more money on promotion to improve hardware and breakfast. Friends who haven't lived and want to try it, it is recommended not to consider if it exceeds 800 with breakfast included, otherwise you will regret it the moment you see breakfast.

Before checking in, Yona, the housekeeper, took the initiative to contact the store to inquire about the arrival time. The hotel is very big, and you can also rent a stroller, which is also very convenient. My daughter likes it very much and rented it twice. I told the aunt in the room to prepare more water, and the aunt directly arranged it into a bowling ball 🎳 Manually like it ~ It is very close to the 68 food street next to it, and it is very convenient to eat. The only regret is that children's parent-child activities can only be participated in the 4-year-old. I didn't pay attention to it before moving in and told me that they could not participate. And the hotel has free nucleic acid every day, which is also very convenient, saving the time of long queues in the block! The price is very expensive, but the service environment is really good~ I will also consider staying in the future

The overall service of the hotel is very good, but some shortcomings are that the facilities are relatively old and not well maintained. You can see scratches everywhere and it is really old, and the walls are still moldy. I went to the sea view bathtub, but when I was soaking, I found that there were all small bugs outside, at least hundreds of them and many entered the bathtub. The hotel can improve it, and then some room services are a bit slow, but after talking to candy It will arrive soon. Overall, the service is very good, but there are still some shortcomings. I hope the hotel can improve

From check-in to check-out, we all received attentive and meticulous help and service from the hotel staff.

Very neat in helping to make the application successful when we learned that we wanted to check out later. After checking out at 2 o'clock, since it was not yet time to go to the airport, she took us to play in "Joy Fun House", a small video game space. Also worried that we would be hungry in the afternoon, took us to the all-day dining restaurant for some refreshments, fruit and drinks.
As a hotel staff, Mia provides a lot of thoughtful services for guests who do not need to leave immediately after check-out. Thank you very much.
The hotel has a rich breakfast, good quality linen, and the toiletries like "Balman"
In short, after the disappointing Atlantis experience, Grand Hyatt brought our trip to Sanya to a successful end.
The hotel has a wealth of fun camping activities, which can be booked in advance for children. The combination of water slides, indoor and outdoor unpowered rides are safe and fun for most kids under 12.

I'm here on vacation but I'm not happy at all. Due to the typhoon weather, my flight was changed to an early flight. I got up at four in the morning. When I arrived at the hotel, it was almost 10:00. At that time, I was very tired. When I checked in, the front desk said that the room was full, which I emphasized several times. Said to check in at 3:00 under normal circumstances. I asked how long it would take to wait, and the reply said two hours. Then I tried to find a place to sit and have a drink and wait to check in, but none of them were open until 11 o'clock when it was open. It was stuffy without air conditioning, so I found a place to sit and wait. If the hotel sees this comment of mine, I think I will ask a question, if the day is full, why did the people behind me check in smoothly? If it is really full, I can hardly see anyone in the lobby Don't everyone hide in the room and don't go out? I'm angry because I don't feel warm and caring in the hotel. Even giving me a glass of water makes me feel warm.
Secondly, I would like to say that the hygiene in your hotel is very poor, please give me an explanation for the hygiene issues I photographed.
Third, the road surface of your hotel has collapsed. This is a safety issue. Adults may pay attention. If a child gets his foot stuck in it, can you be responsible for such a safety issue?
This is the least favorite Grand Hyatt I have ever stayed at.

msg:Because I have to stay for a long time, I struggled with a lot of hotels before I came, and finally chose the Grand Hyatt. The building is not as cool as the mangroves next to it, but the living feeling and hardware are perfect, garden design, constant temperature swimming pool, sea-viewing bathtub, poolside restaurant owner The chef's craftsmanship is very good, the hardware, software and services are enough to exceed the five-star standard, the hygiene is in place, we are equipped with a housekeeper, and the toiletries are BALMAIN, so there will be no pain points in many hotels in Sanya with five-star prices and three-star standards, hotel beaches and Atlantis Beach is connected, the waves are a little bigger, but the view is good. There will be two sofas in the room of the supreme sea view room. The terrace is very large, and there are also sofas, tables and chairs to lie down and watch the sunrise. Will revisit next time I come.

Ask me nothing and ask me to make an appoin**ent and make a phone call, so I don't know why I just push a butler for me when I check in! In the end, I left, and the housekeeper hadn't even seen it. When I arrived at the airport, I asked the so-called check-in experience in WeChat! Let’s talk about the quality of the breakfast waiter. It’s really bad. It’s only been ten minutes since I ate with my child. It took me a while to pick up the meal. The iced coffee and scrambled eggs I just took are on the table, and they haven’t been touched. I was cleaned by the whole table, and then I went back to my seat, and I didn't leave me a bite to eat, so I moved away! I want to know, are you driving the guests away? Let’s talk about the facilities. Maybe the hotel is not new. There are very few swimming pools. In the whole hotel, there is only one swimming pool for adults and one for children! Absolutely, with so many guests, it's like making dumplings! Anyway, there is no next time, so let's just say it happily!

The environment of the hotel is very good, although it is a bit far from the sea, but there are battery cars to travel. The room was clean and comfortable and the service was good. A variety of restaurants with different flavors and large and small swimming pools and water parks can meet all kinds of needs. The quality and taste of the buffet breakfast is also good. The pictures are all taken by me for your reference.

It is worth mentioning that their bathtub is the largest in the hotel I stayed in this time, and the standard room type is also a square bathtub, which is particularly large. The suite bathtub is even bigger. The service staff lacked initiative. There was no housekeeper on the first day. I was too busy with two children by myself, but in fact, I urged us four times. As a result, we were missed when we changed rooms the next day, and we waited until almost evening. In exchange, it was solved by adding the housekeeper kiki in the afternoon of the next day! Here, I would like to commend the housekeeper Kiki. Since I added her, I only need to explain it once in the next few days, and I will never forget it. It is done quickly and well! It's super fast to reply to WeChat anytime! Thank her so much!

I pay great attention to details. For example, there are more than 10 bottles of mineral water in the room. The mini bar can also be used for free on the first day. When I go to the beach at night, the housekeeper, Miss Mia, also kindly arranged a car to pick up and drop off. , apply for late check-out is also very refreshing

In addition, the hotel has a lot of supporting facilities. There are three swimming pools, including the swimming pool of the water park for children. I like the gym and game hall on the fifth floor, especially the gym equipment is very advanced, and the yoga room can be seen. Seaside, free 20 coins in the arcade

If I hadn't already booked the next destination in advance, I really want to stay for a few more days. Oh, by the way, the beach here is of good quality. It's very soft to take off your shoes and walk. Thank you again Miss Mia for her service.

The peak season in Sanya has begun, and the only choice is a parent-child room without a pool room. Although the hotel facilities are old, they are still very attractive. Although I didn't go to experience Yuequ Camp, I thought it was good to see it when I passed by. The only dissatisfaction is that the hotel's shuttle bus is unlucky, and it takes a long time to wait for more people and less vehicles.
The housekeeper Alex has a very good service. He will take the initiative to ask about the needs of room cleaning and replacement, and communicate in a timely manner when encountering things.

The living room, dining room, kitchen, tableware and kitchenware are fully equipped. Children can eat everything, and there is also a mahjong table for entertainment. The surrounding 68 food street is clean and hygienic, the taste is good, and the charges are publicized very formal, which is reassuring. In particular, I would like to praise the service of the housekeeper LYNN and the manager on duty. We arrived at the hotel in advance and the villa was not cleaned. The manager on duty arranged two large rooms to rest first, and also presented hotel meal coupons. Every day, the housekeeper LYNN helped us arrange the shuttle bus and make reservations for children's activities in time. Before leaving, the flight was at 6:00 pm, and he took the initiative to help us to delay the check-out until 3:30. This time we had a great time with two elderly people and three children. Next time I come to Sanya, I will definitely choose Grand Hyatt Hotel.

msg:During the epidemic, I came to Sanya alone and stayed at the Grand Hyatt Haitang Bay Hotel. The price is very high. Although it is much cheaper, the service level has not been discounted. The caring and responsive to every request, showing the brand service of Grand Hyatt, which is highly praised. In addition, the restaurant of the hotel is also very perfect, and the taste is superb. The hotel is also connected to 68 Food City, which is super convenient. Recommend it to friends who come to Haitang Bay, you can't go wrong to choose Grand Hyatt in Haitang Bay 😘

I stayed in Sanya for 9 days and stayed in seven five-star hotels. The Grand Hyatt experience is the best.
Driving my own car, the hotel staff will automatically unload my luggage from the moment I get to the hotel. The front desk staff has called me in advance to inform me of the check-in procedure.
After check-in, whether it is take-out, you need to eat ice and wine. It's all hotel staff. A big compliment to Lynn here.
Quiet, elegant and comfortable. I must come again next time I come to Sanya.

msg:Taking advantage of the fact that no one came to Sanya for a three-day, two-night trip after the May Day, the second night's stay at the Grand Hyatt Haitang Bay made our trip even more complete ~ The butler Kobe's enthusiasm was felt from the front desk, because I didn't answer When we called the day before, we had to arrange the floating afternoon tea time one day in advance. Kobe also helped us to arrange it for the afternoon. Great~ My boyfriend's request for a cup of watermelon juice was unconditionally met~ The most touching thing It was Kobe who knew that we were going to fly the next afternoon and said to help us apply for a late check-out at 3 o'clock, so that we could rest for a while before leaving for the airport! In the meantime, if there is any problem, WeChat will also reply in seconds hahaha (even at 1:00 in the morning), call Kobe's service infinitely!!! In addition, the hot water in the room is a bit slow, and after swimming in the room, I want to take a hot shower Just have to wait a while.
P.S. Due to the epidemic situation, guests staying at Haitang Bay Hotel recently need to perform a nasal swab antigen test at the front desk~

msg:The abnormal noise of the hotel's air conditioner made it impossible to sleep all night, because it was a two-day stay package at twelve o'clock at night to contact the hotel to change the room the next day! The front desk told them to change it at breakfast the next day! The child was also awakened by the air conditioner at 6 o'clock. When he went downstairs for breakfast at 7 o'clock, he went to the front desk again to ask when the room could be changed. The answer was that he was confirming that I should go to eat first! After the meal, I went back to the room until almost ten o'clock and called the front desk again to ask the front desk, and the answer was still needed to confirm the room again! I was very annoyed at this time without a rest all night, contacted Ctrip and asked to check out and change the hotel! At this time, the front desk called and said that the room has been arranged and can be changed now! But at this point I don't want to stay any longer! Pack your luggage and let Ctrip handle check-out
In the end, after many times of communication with Ctrip, the hotel refused to refund the room fee and an afternoon tea set without consumption! too dark! It is entirely because of the hotel's reasons that the check-out does not give the customer a check-out fee! Even if I don't want this kind of money, I don't want to stay for a minute!
  Let's talk about the hotel environment, the room hygiene is extremely poor, the floor has fine sand, and the glass of the shower door and bathtub has very obvious water stains. The housekeeper service and child custody service of the hotel details are all false. After consulting the playroom and the front desk, there is no custody service, and no housekeeper service is arranged for check-in!
The introduction of the hotel was not clear at the front desk, so after checking in, I didn't know that there was a battery car to pick up and drop off. By walking and asking the garden watering staff all the way to find the children's playroom and children's swimming pool! Very far from the main building room!
The children's playroom has a heavy plastic smell, and there are a lot of small flying insects, constantly flying into the face and eyes.
The bathroom next to the standard pool has a little light in the compar**ent, and the aisle light is not turned on at all. Children dare not walk in at all! This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in Sanya! It's so emotional! Don't step on the pit!

The room is spacious and bright, the balcony is super large, and the view is very beautiful. The hotel has a beautiful environment and beautiful gardens. The location is unbeatable, downstairs is the food street, close to Sanya Duty Free Shop, Atlantis Water World and Aquarium. Facing Haitang Bay, there is a heated swimming pool and a children's swimming pool. The breakfast is plentiful and has everything you need. The front desk service is warm, and the check-in and check-out efficiency is high. Because I brought children, the hotel took the initiative to arrange two beds, one big and one small, which was very considerate. The customer service is always on call, the rooms are clean and tidy, and the stay is comfortable. Butler Xiao Wu took the initiative to serve, responds to calls, and meets needs, which is particularly touching. For a trip to Sanya, staying at the Grand Hyatt Hotel makes the trip perfect.

There is a large sofa bed on the balcony, lying on it, looking at the sea, and watching the iPad with a small wind, it is very comfortable.
🚗 Transportation: On the coast of Haitang District, you can get to the hotel in 45 minutes from the airport, which is easy to find. It takes 15 minutes by car to reach the duty-free shop.
🧹Sanitation: The room is very clean and the facilities are very new
🍃Environment: The environment in the room and hotel is amazing. There are not many people in the hotel, so the plants and swimming pools outside the hotel are not organized and opened. So the hotel fee we pay is not included?
🔔Service: There are butlers. When we arrive, the butler will greet them and then deliver the luggage to the room. Our butler is Kaylee, a beautiful lady who helps us arrange the room every day and help me answer questions. The other ladies at the front desk and the little brother who cleaned up the room were very good.

🔔Facilities: There is only one heated swimming pool. Neither the children's pool nor the family swimming pool are heated. The temperature was low a few days ago and the children were shivering.

🧹Hygiene: The large bathtub in the room is a plus, but the sugar left by the previous guest is still stuck on the edge of the bathtub and has not been cleaned up. It should be the negligence of the housekeeping staff

msg:I was very happy to live in Junyue during pregnancy. After the cub was born, I never went out to play because of the epidemic. This New Year, I just took the opportunity to take the cub to see the places I have been to before, which is a revisit to the old place. The hotel has not changed from three years ago, and the style is very comfortable when you walk in the door. The housekeeper Alex is very caring and will take the initiative to ask the needs in advance. The only small regret is that the maintenance of the park seems to be poor, the landscaping feels almost as meaningless as it was three years ago, and the water level in the pond has dropped significantly. Yuequ Camp is highly playable, and the cubs had a great time. The breakfast is also rich, and I also got a giraffe balloon made by the clown. The Joy Camp activities require children aged 4-6 years or older to participate. Our family over two years old can't participate in the activities except to play the ocean slide and ball in it. The swimming pool is very interesting in the impression, but because of the cooling during the stay, I couldn't go to the children's pool to play. Generally speaking, it is not noisy or noisy, and it is OK to bring a baby. It is very comfortable to live in. I personally think it is a good choice for vacation.

The hotel room types are basically divided into sea-view rooms and mountain-view rooms. I recommend deluxe sea-view rooms, and high-rise rooms are recommended for mountain views. The breakfast is relatively rich, and when there are many people, it is necessary to queue up and take meals. I like the "Joy Fun Camp" in the hotel. Many parent-child activities are arranged every day, which is very powerful. There is a room temperature swimming pool and a very warm children's playground and bubble pool, which are a little farther from the room. The lawn is by the sea, there are many activities and the scenery is beautiful. The management of this little housekeeper is very good (my housekeeper Lana is very nice, and the service is in place and warm and considerate) and the little brothers and sisters of Yuequ Camp are very good. In short, I stayed in Haitang Bay for four nights. My whole family and I didn't have enough time. Next time, I will choose it directly without hesitation.

One more thing to mention, going out is 68 Commercial Street, it is not too convenient, Junyue is really the right place and the right place 👍

The first stop was CLUBMED, and the last stop was Grand Hyatt. The rooms and facilities of Grand Hyatt were not mentioned. It was great and the location was good. Go to the duty-free shop, Atlantis Aquarium, and Wuzhizhou Island. It is very convenient, including going to the 301 hospital twice during the period for nucleic acid testing. The three-day housekeeper Alex was very caring and helped to order afternoon tea and seafood buffet hot pot. Finally, he left the hotel. The child pulled his watch to the room and helped him find it.

Children play a lot, constant temperature swimming pool, children's climbing, indoor playground... There are children's activities from morning to night. There are special teachers who are responsible for teaching children to play games and crafts, and the children are very happy. The housekeeper service is also good and will take the initiative to help upgrade the room type. It is recommended that parents and children stay for a few more days. The only downside is that the beach in Haitang Bay has strong wind and waves, so you can't swim in the sea, but the swimming pool is enough to play

The little brother at the front desk was kind and handsome. Knowing that he was bringing an old man on vacation, he specially gave him a room on the 18th floor. The housekeeper also gave me the room card to me who was having afternoon tea. The service was in place!
Afternoon tea desserts are very good, just blowing the sea breeze can give you a sense of vacation. The room is very big, the bathroom and the big bathtub, I like it 😍 The large balcony looks out to the invincible sea view, the location is great! The hotel's breakfast is rich. I like this rice noodle. The Chinese restaurant has a good view and taste, and the price is moderate. If you want to taste more food, you can go directly to Haitang 68 Food Street by turning left out of the hotel. It's great~
Special thanks to the sweet butler sister Lynn, gentle and patient, always
Follow up the living details, and arrange fruit and delicate snack trays for the old man every day. I also nagged the housekeeper to send me pen and paper in the big night, because it is so comfortable to live with your help. Haha, the first choice for vacation in Sanya in the future Wyatt

🚗 Transportation: It is very convenient to take a taxi. When you go to the duty-free shop, you can pick up the shared electric vehicles on the street🛵. It is a little over 3 kilometers away and the whole journey goes in a straight line, which is incomparably convenient.

🧹Hygiene: The room hygiene is very good. I am a picky person and I think it is OK.

🔔Service: The most enjoyable thing for me during my entire stay was the butler service. First of all, I would like to thank Kobe and Jasmine for their considerate reception. They added WeChat to confirm our room check before checking in. They also arranged for us to be on the high floor of the main building and upgraded the sea view for free. In the room, fruits and snacks were given for check-in, and the minibar was also free. I mean, this is really good. Haha, we will try our best to meet our requirements during the check-in process. We also gave snacks at the end of the check-out. It was really nice. Thoughtful💗

🍃Environment: There is a big Chris**as tree at the entrance of the hotel lobby🎄. The festive a**osphere is very strong. The greening of the hotel is also quite good. It is very interesting to take pictures casually. I would like to make a small suggestion. It would be better if there are some deck chairs on the beach🌝

The garden scenery is also very beautiful, quiet and comfortable, suitable for walking and taking pictures, walking to the beach and coconut grove, the beach is very clean, very suitable for vacation. During the stay, wherever you need help, you can find Zoe to solve it. The experience of Sanya Grand Hyatt is very good!

msg:After being recommended by a friend, I was very satisfied in all aspects. Not only did we upgrade the room type, but also added an extra bed for free, and gave us a bottle of red wine! What a surprise ✌🏻
The hotel environment is very good, you can go directly to the 68 Food City next door, the variety of food is beautiful! It is also very close to the beach, so suitable for watching the sunrise! Under the beautiful scenery, the three of us made an appoin**ent to take a sunrise riding photo, which was perfect 💗
I accidentally strained my foot on the second day of check-in. My little brother hurriedly brought me ice cubes and Yunnan Baiyao, and most importantly, the wheelchair! Not only allows me to recover faster, but also allows me to eat, drink and play as usual!
Very good experience, it is worth recommending to friends!

msg:I have seen several hotels in Haitang Bay, and I recently locked up Junyue, because I like his ocean-view bathtub, there will be a small assistant to contact me before going out. The one who contacted me was Alice, a very enthusiastic and high-value girl ☺️will Ask me how I live? If you have questions or have an appoin**ent, you can tell her that my needs can be met. The room is facing the sea and is very comfortable, but it is a bit far from the beach. If you have to walk, you need to walk for a while, but the design of the garden makes people feel comfortable. I think it’s okay to walk for a while 😀😀 There are a lot of fun facilities for children, and I’m going to bring the kids next time! There are also several swimming pools, all of which are distinguished, and you can follow the signs. Duty-free shops need to make an appoin**ent with the assistant one day in advance, and there is a shuttle bus. Woke up early the next day and saw the sunrise, which was a worthwhile trip.

The style of the hotel is what I like, and the comfort of the bedding is also very good. Overall, the only shortcoming is that the glass in the shower room is stained badly😑

msg:Super awesome!

🚗 Transportation: We came here by car, there are plenty of parking spaces, and of course the hotel is free! Just in the street of Haitang Bay Hotel, the starting price to go to the duty-free shop, the most important thing to eat, Haitang 66 or 99 is right by the hotel's gate! There is also an exclusive passage from the lobby, which is really convenient (lazy welfare)

🧹Hygienic: As always, it is clean and tidy, and there is no dust by hand in a few places. The room is big enough to face the sea. The nicest oversized bathtub, you can sit down and catch your family's feet while taking a bath while watching the sea!
🍃Environment: The overall vacation feeling of the entire hotel is not top-notch in Grand Hyatt, but the specially built restaurant is indeed full of charm, the taste is quite satisfactory but the service is very good. The hotel recommends to experience a meal. Haitang Bay does not get into the water because of the big waves, but there are no sun loungers and umbrellas on the beach. These facilities are still a little unhappy 🙁. The swimming pool is great, the multi-level infinity pool, and several swimming pools that are not open due to the epidemic, it is very convenient to order food, and the waiters at the seaside barbecue restaurant are very enthusiastic! Coconut is very sweet haha
🔔Service: The service consciousness and degree of the whole hotel are close to full marks, and the housekeeper Jessica is especially praised! Be responsive, every day there are free fruits or snacks, you can make a reservation and tell her about it! Our plane flew at 5 o'clock and checked out until 2 o'clock (drillingly until 2:30) I didn't expect to meet in the lobby at the last moment.
Ps Finally, I would like to give some tips. The hotel has been in business for several years, and the facilities are well protected, but some electronic equipment has indeed been updated very quickly. I hope the hotel can be more up to date~

msg:Praise several front desk staff, two chefs, and suggestions for recent guests:
1. Praise a thin female front desk clerk with glasses. Sorry to forget her name. She is not bad. She speaks and handles problems appropriately! Special praise for supervisor Alin, who is quite good! Although she is a supervisor, her ability to handle things and speak is close to that of a first mate. She is professional and flexible, and has a certain texture in her work and speech! Allen, the front desk guy, is good. Although he doesn't like to laugh, he is more patient and has a strong ability to control his emotions. Anyway, you can't feel his mood swings, and it's hard for you to see him have any emotions. Many people can't do this!
2. Praise a slightly fat chef wearing black-framed glasses at the breakfast stall. He has a good attitude and speaks more politely. He is the kind of person who is physically and mentally healthy! I also praise the chef I met at the Guest House on the afternoon of April 5. He has very white skin and is not very tall, but he likes to laugh more, treats guests sincerely, and has the service concept of Shangri-La to treat others as oneself! He is also more rigorous in food production!
3. The hotel has strengthened the persuasion of guests wearing masks for breakfast and other buffet meals, which makes me feel more at ease! I once again suggest that guests must wear masks correctly when picking up food to protect themselves and others! Guests with children, please take care of your baby, don't let her touch the food with her hands or talk to the food without a mask, and please take care of your children and don't run around in the Grand Court. Please don't play ** or online videos, it's really annoying and noisy, please pay attention to the public areas! Thank you! 
Fourth, please take the elevator down first and then up, don't go into the elevator before the people above us get off the elevator, especially some young people, who are educated, should pay more attention, I have encountered such guests with poor quality several times. Please wait for the elevator to stand on both sides, don't block the middle passage, like Shanghai, everyone basically stands on both sides of the door to line up, see Chongqing people take the public bus, everyone is in line at the station, there is no such crowd! Thank you! 
Fifth, hotel staff have the concept and obligation to provide professional and polite service, but please respect each other! Today, when I was looking for the front desk in the lobby to check in, I heard a guest come over and directly said to the front desk: Do you have toilet water? Hurry up... There is no courtesy when talking and asking questions! We Chinese people value courtesy, righteousness, and shame. I hope some guests can be more polite when talking to them! As a regular guest for more than a month, I never treat others arrogantly, so why do some people treat themselves as a master! 

Grand Hyatt Hotel is generally good. Of course, you get what you pay for. The Edition next door is really good. The welcome gifts are all big-name bath samples, dessert macarons... They are willing to spend money, but the price is definitely more expensive than here! Grand Hyatt gives me the feeling of taking a conventional route, with business elements and integrated parent-child projects. The design concept contains Chinese cultural heritage. There are too many young people in Edition, which is not suitable for me. It depends on personal preference! Guests with quality and heritage should not regret choosing Grand Hyatt. I recommend you to stay!

The hotel is very clean, the layout is reasonable, the waiters are enthusiastic and professional, and they are doing their best to meet the needs of customers and provide quality services as soon as possible. Having stayed at so many five-star resort hotels, for the first time there is no slot, and I don't feel uncomfortable. Secondly, the scenery is super beautiful, and the hotel activities are rich and varied. Adults and children can play and rest in the hotel well, and their body and mind are greatly relaxed. Finally, the separate layout of the three buildings of the hotel is designed with more than ten rooms on each floor, which is completely different from those dormitory-style resort hotels, so that customers will not feel crowded at all even during Golden Week. This time the hotel was very praised. .

msg:This time I stayed in three hotels, Westin, Atlantis, and Grand Hyatt. The decoration style, garden style, and room setting details of the Grand Hyatt Hotel are my favorite.
The super-large bed is really super-large. A family of three sleeping together and turning over can hardly be touched. The sink is also large. No amount of cosmetics can be put down completely. The bathtub is also big. Children’s bathing is more fun than swimming, and there are capsules. You can make your own coffee, and you need ice to tell the front desk to bring it.
We ordered a set meal with breakfast and dinner. Breakfast is the normal level of a five-star hotel. Dinner is very good. We have buffet seafood hot pot one day, Chinese restaurant set meal one day, seafood hot pot is very delicate, all are unlimited supply, ordering method The design is well designed, and there is no looting or squatting of expensive ingredients. They are all eaten as much as you want, and you can eat elegantly. The Chinese restaurant is even more pleasantly surprised. First of all, the Yucun restaurant has a beautiful design, and the food is really delicious. The sweet soup at the end is also very popular. After eating, you can buy fish food and feed the fish. The scene is beautiful and pleasant. The disadvantage is that the food is slow, and the price is high if you don't buy the set meal.
The sea, the family pool, and the children’s pool are basically together. You can enjoy it all at once by calling a car. The seaside here must be taken. It’s so beautiful. I don’t know if it’s because of the sun exposure. The photos that came out are completely blockbuster...nice! Tanning is also worth it!
In the off-season, there is actually no need to book a pool room. There are not many people who play directly in the public pool. It is fun to play. I don't want to go to the room pool when I go back to the room. The bubble bath is great.
If you don’t bring your children and don’t watch the aquarium, Grand Hyatt is currently the first choice. The family services for children need to be improved. At the three hotels, I have remarks that there will be small friends when I place my order, but among the three hotels, only Grand Hyatt does not have children’s gifts, and children’s toiletries, room slippers, bathrobes, etc., are all requested after my stay. .
Sunny, the housekeeper, shouldn’t have been working for a long time, but I can meet our requirements as hard as possible. I basically tell the housekeeper about everything. Firstly, I look at the speed of response, and secondly, I look at the efficiency of the solution. He has a good attitude.

Needless to say, the hotel’s hardware facilities have a high green coverage rate. I booked the hotel’s supreme sea-view room and looked out from the terrace to a huge garden downstairs. The sea and the sky are all in the distance. Beach, walking on the waves after sunset, walking along the beach with your lover, isn’t this comfortable life that every busy city dweller wants most. Let’s talk about the software of the hotel again. This time, the hotel is also equipped with the hotel butler Jesscia. Every day, I will send a message to greet if there is any problem when I check in. Is there any place I need help? It is very intimate to give guests a feeling of being at home and help us for free. The late check-out has brought us great convenience, here is a 👍. For me, the choice of a resort hotel in Sanya is very important. Basically, half of the time is spent in the hotel. Because vacation is about relaxation instead of punching in the sights, so Grand Hyatt is such an ideal resort hotel, even if you spend a day in the hotel You can never feel bored.

Regarding service, the housekeeper Jessica can basically contact her at any time, such as asking for a car from the lobby to the swimming pool and beach, cleaning the rooms and rooms, etc. The efficiency is very fast.
Regarding dining, Grand Hyatt’s breakfast is very good, with more varieties, and the fruits are cut on the spot. There is no need to line up for meals in the off-season in the morning. The experience is very good. The four-day afternoon tea and cocktail party in the executive lounge are also very good. Every day at four or five o'clock in the afternoon to have a drink and some snacks, it is quite pleasant to watch the sea view.
Regarding the room, this time we went with two couples. We booked the supreme two-bedroom interlocking suite. The floor is on the 15th floor with a direct sea view. This room type is very satisfactory. The layout is a door access control card to enter. There is a standard room on the left hand side, and a suite with a living room on the right hand side. Each has its own separate access control, which not only guarantees privacy, but also can enjoy 200 square meters of suites. Enjoyment. There are three bathtubs in the room, two of which face the sea, the bathrooms are large, and the facilities are quite new.
Regarding hotel facilities, in addition to the executive lounge, the hotel’s swimming pool is also good. The children’s and parent-child swimming pools were open when we went, with few people and clean. Overall it's good.

For dinner, you can consider the restaurant street next to the hotel, and you can choose seafood to go to the store. It’s a 20-minute walk from Atlantis, and it’s 12 yuan by taxi.

msg:🚗 Transportation: The core area of Haitang Bay Hotel, next to a complex, is very convenient for eating.

🧹Hygienic: The building and rooms are good, and the park needs to be strengthened. The pressure of competition in Sanya hotels is too great. Better every detail may be the key to victory.

🍃Environment: Compared with some hotels, the lobby is a little less a**ospheric and more refined. I like the park very much. In the lush greenery, you can find many surprises. There are many swimming pools. Although they are not big, the functional areas are set up reasonably. Children's pools, children's water parks, family pools, and even infinity pools! In a hotel in Sanya, there can be a large pond with Jinli in it, which is not very common, and it is another surprise for the children!

🔔Service: Alice, the butler, tracks the service throughout the whole process. If you need to solve it in time, you will be greeted at the door when you leave. Very kind, thank you! The staff are also very friendly. They asked a male staff member about the location of the Grand Guest House and walked a long way to help us there!
This room is reserved for Junyue's more Internet celebrity room. It is very suitable for children. Not only there are slides, but even video games, and my son will not go to bed until the early hours of the morning! The bedding in the room is comfortable, the bath products are of favorite brands, and the children's bath products are all complete!
Anyway, I really like this hotel!
But it must be explained that the business philosophy of the hotel must not be too monetary. Everything must be solved with money, and it will lose the warmth that a resort hotel should have. After all, is it a problem for four people in a room for more than 10,000 nights? In this way, I want to charge two more people, which is a bit uncomprehending! Although this problem was solved through communication, it did affect the 100% good impression of Grand Hyatt! Grand Hyatt can actually do better!

msg:The hotel is very clean, the rooms are spacious and the interior design is very practical.
It is about 4 kilometers away from the duty-free shop. It is easy to take a taxi at the door and there are also small eDonkeys.
There is a small commercial street at the entrance of the hotel. If you don't want to dine in the hotel, you can walk for 3 minutes. However, the food inside the hotel is still very good.
The service is very good. The butler Lynn is very enthusiastic. Before I arrived at the hotel, he contacted me and asked when I would arrive. During my stay in the hotel, I also asked about the room situation and whether I need to purchase anything.
Although Ctrip is on the parent-child hotel rankings, I personally think that it is more business-oriented.
Because the swimming pool and the beach are farther away, although there is a shuttle bus, you have to wait and the waiting time is up. And the pool is either very shallow, or it is at a depth of 120. So it is more suitable for younger children and children over 140 and adults.
The beach is still in a semi-developed state. The most dangerous riders are those who sell popsicles. Children play in the sand on the beach. They ride past the children on motorcycles, and the exhaust is also very large. If the beach is privately owned by the hotel, I don't know if this situation won't happen after the later development is completed.
Overall it is praised by 5 points, because it is clean and tidy, I will consider it next time I come to Sanya.

msg:Grand Hyatt is the second stop of our Sanya trip. Joyce, the butler of the Grand Hyatt Hotel, chose a very good sea view room for us, and the answer was faster every time something happened.
Regarding breakfast, Grand Hyatt’s breakfast is still very good. It’s more informative than the St. Regis Hotel. The two hotels I stayed at this time were very crowded. When the breakfast line was in line, there were staff members who managed the orderly. Not bad. I want to say that the breakfast at the Grand Hyatt Hotel is very cost-effective, at least I feel so.

Regarding the guest room, because Grand Hyatt does not have a two-meter king-size bed, I chose two rooms with a 150 cm bed and they fit together. Regarding extra beds, the hotel pages are available for viewing and some require a fee.

Regarding the swimming pool, we went to the children’s entertainment pool and the children were very happy

About the sea-view beach The beach is super beautiful, very big, and very fine
Opposite our hotel is Wuzhizhou Island, so the scenery is very good. This time we basically didn't play any projects. It was too hot to go out during the day. Ride the Meituan tram to eat Alang seafood at night, don't eat the story of Begonia! Super unpalatable and expensive! Don't listen to the driver's introduction! You can go to 68 Food City, and you can also choose the seafood supermarket inside. Junyue Hebi is 68 Food City, and the Hualian Supermarket is too messy. The experience is very poor.
The biggest feeling in Sanya is that there are no mosquitoes🦟No mosquitoes🦟, I haven’t been bitten even once. It’s amazing. It’s useless to bring a bunch of mosquito repellents. I want to go next year and want to go hahahaha

The hotel also gave out 50 game coins to experience a handful of indoor games and gave a star-studded appraisal.

Service: There is no dedicated housekeeper. During the period, someone will call to inquire about the check-in experience. The customer service is very good. The cleaning brother is very hard.
Room: This suite really surprises me. It's big... The only problem is that there will be a bit of musty smell when going out of the elevator on the 17th floor... including the air in the room, which is also a bit musty... Maybe because of the wetness of the beach... Hope this can be thought of How to improve it? Or a unified air supply in the public area of the hotel can consider sending some fragrance? This should be possible... Many five-star hotels still have fragrance in the lobby... This can make up for some problems...
Next time I will consider staying in a similar room type.
The next day I came back, I found something fell in the hotel, Miss Lena, the hotel was pretty good, arranged for us to send back the forgotten items

Breakfast is on the 1st floor, there are also 3 stalls, Chinese and Western dishes are available.
The sand on the beach is relatively fine, but Haitang Bay cannot be launched into the water.
There is a food court next to the hotel, which is very convenient for shopping and eating.

The basic room type is 60 square meters, which is much larger than Hilton
Separate dry and wet, large drying table, no pressure to dry clothes
Breakfast is generally useless. If you go for breakfast during the holidays, you should go early, or go at 10 o’clock, so you don’t have to wait in line, and you don’t have to eat lunch right after eating.
Three swimming pools, suitable for the needs of all stages;
The summer camp courses made my children linger and forget to return. Before returning home the next day, they also participated in an experimental class. Coach Chen, who really likes Yuequ Camp.
Room service responded promptly, cleaned up, and supplemented with drinking water
No mini bar, buy some from the supermarket next to me, it’s more affordable on ice

msg:這趟旅行最需要感謝的就是管家小凱啦 熱心 友善 事事有迴應 件件有着落 讓我們對Hyatt印象很好 

這次預訂的海景套房寬暢明亮 空間劃分合理 兩個娃睡覺互不打擾 而且床品也很贊 睡得格外舒服 

嘉賓軒晚餐中規中矩 但酒品種類比較豐富 適合懶人家庭 衹要孩子不挑 餓不着

小童泳池還是挺好的 但是滑梯類一直噴水 其實不算很適合低幼寶寶 3歲以上的寶寶應該蠻開心 

酒店的擺渡車服務還可以 偶爾需要等等 但是小火車居然要收費 58一次 

早餐還行 最愛粉面鋪子 但咖啡是真難喝

對管家小凱的服務也非常滿意，每次有事情麻煩他，他總是第一時間迴應，熱情好客，感受到了賓至如歸的感受，有什麼需求會盡量滿足， 幫忙升級了房型，安排的房間離得很近。一切都很完美。很適合親子出遊。
另外不得不説，酒店合作的鉑郎旅拍拍的照片也太好看了。本來衹想要酒店贈送的10張照片，但選片的時候發現都拍的好好，一下子又選了好多，很值得。

建議是:1.既然是園林風格的酒店，更要做好消殺工作，多安排一些防蚊蟲的薰香，（可參考艾迪遜）不然一出房間，酒店裡的蚊子上來就是10個以上的蚊子塊
2.有私人沙灘沒合理利用，衹有海灘，沒有沙灘椅，也沒有工作人員在那邊，説實話住了五天就去過一次海邊。麗思卡爾頓跟文華東方海灘這一塊就利用的很好

最後再次誇一下酒店的服務，點名誇管家小凱。

msg:提前定的兩天，第二天有了房間所以酒店就給升級了海景房，很棒哇～
早上開始下雨🌧️，躺在陽台大床上看着外面的雨還真是有點愜意😌
設施：傳統五星酒店，設施齊全，洗臉盆都是兩個，健身房全天開放（我們去稱了體重😂），泳池分為成人，小童和家庭三個，傍晚還有泡泡🫧🫧派對~小孩子玩兒的不亦樂乎~

衞生：雖然酒店開的時間久，但衞生沒有問題，所見之處都乾淨，杯子也擦的挺亮，衞浴的不銹鋼也亮晶晶的~

環境：海邊的酒店，環境沒得説，園林式的設計，有廊橋、小湖和漂亮的錦鯉，植物多樣，走在外面基本都有樹蔭~

服務：
管家式服務，衹對接一個人就可以了，省心省事😊
酒店每天的很多時段都會安排一些活動，沒事海邊走走，不想出門就參加活動也挺不錯，度假就是要無所事事的躺着（●v●）🛌
服務整體還是不錯的，都能很好的各司其職~

雙人“海島夜食集”自助晚餐:特色就是有駐唱歌手，還會吹奏薩克斯🎷，很浪漫~套餐帶了雙人早餐和晚餐還挺值的，有一些海南當地特色食品~

蜜月驚喜佈置服務:雖然我們不是蜜月，但也讓管家幫忙佈置了一下🌹🌹🌹

這家房卡挺有特色，木質的似的，挺喜歡的~
總之在這裏還是挺愉快的，有了問題處理也及時~

房間：房間很大，尤其是大浴缸很吸引眼球。但大床好像衹是queen size，不是king，其實這麼大的空間應該是可以放到king的。

環境：環境來説，標準的度假酒店風格，但這裡有個點就是樓離海邊太遠，所謂海景房其實衹能遠遠的看到一點點海。另外整體度假感不夠，更多的好像是為親子設定的活動，對情侶出遊不那麼友好。

最後吐槽是不是海棠灣酒店沙灘都沒有維護和沙灘椅，度假感不足。

但是！但是！但是！但是！因為自己的堅決下訂，讓這次4天的親子游倍感難忘！
特別感謝管家kobe對我們無微不至的照顧！💯💯💯💯
衞生方面:我覺得基本找不出什麼毛病，打掃及時，且服務員們態度熱情，並且還會主動關心有無需求。
設施方面:小童遊樂場館，泳池，公共觀賞區域都可圈可點，環境也尚可！
餐飲方面:早餐中規中矩，入住4天基本到最後一天才出現吃膩的狀況，哈哈哈；晚餐非常推薦大家試一下，bbq和海南糟粕醋真的絕！真的絕！真的絕！另外還有無線自助清補涼也很nice。另外酒店聯通了一個美食廣場喲！
服務方面:從大堂到酒店內部工作人的服務都很及時，酒店內部接駁車很方便，在熱帶地區對帶娃家庭非常友好！
總體來説基本上是一個帶娃躺屍非常好的酒店推薦！

msg:出行前兩天才訂的酒店，價格不算離譜，整體是超過預期的，畢竟對三亞的整體印象並不是特別好。
酒店的位置很好，2km到亞特，4km到免税店，入住三天也衹去了這倆地兒，剩下時間都在酒店裡。
酒店泳池是娃的最愛，成人泳池是恆温（熱的），小童泳池有兩組水滑梯，家庭泳池是泡泡派對所在，全部體驗了，很不錯。
早餐種類豐富，我們家吃的都比較單調，我最喜歡的是煎餃和鮮榨果汁，媳婦喜歡水果，娃們喜歡麪包果醬，長者們喜歡麪食。
房間在南樓，略有不便，但勝在景色好，離美食街近；缺點是離嘉賓軒（北樓10樓）太遠，所以衹能特意去體驗了一次，感覺還行。
工作人員服務態度都在線，管家Kobe在特別早和特別晚的時候都能及時回覆信息並安排好相關事宜，省心不少；早餐旁邊的氣球做的很好，姑娘很耐心的給老大老二都做了氣球，但。。。我忘了她叫啥；中間經歷了一次停水，也都耐心解釋了，市政問題確實衹能挨着。

客房佈局合理，套房符合親子出行需求，該有的都有。雖然開業有些年頭，保養還是可以的，基礎設施要比天房洲際出色。
親子活動，通過＜悦趣營＞開展，活動豐富，小朋友參加了卡丁車，交通特訓項目，室內遊樂場不大，但是熱熱身消磨個把小時沒問題哈哈。
服務是亮點，入住伊始發生小插曲，我的管家Alex聽取反饋後高度重視，優先上升處理。Alex在入住期間不斷提供具有價值的訊息，大事小事留言，總能有快速專業的答覆，讓人很放心。
套房享受嘉賓軒服務，每天晚上happy hour出色，有三文魚以及小食，對於度假酒店而言，很重要。
位置來説，酒店隔壁有68美食街，就餐很便利。距離免税店和亞特蘭蒂斯都是10分鐘車程以內。
總體非常推薦海棠灣君悦，最近有兩晚的套房套餐，性價比拉滿，推薦入住

這裏的員工都非常親切和專業，特別是管家Alex，剛來辦入住後加了微信，告訴我這裏所有設施的情況，還給了酒店的優惠券和免税店的優惠券。帶我們去房間後，還給我們介紹。後來我有一些問題找他，他都幫我做到。最後一天飛機有延誤，還幫我們延遲退房，非常感謝，可以説是所有酒店裡服務最好的。
總的來説，君悦酒店是一座非常出色的酒店，無論是設施、服務還是環境都非常出色。邊上就是亞特蘭蒂斯水世界，晚上還能看到隔壁的無人機表演。另外邊上紅樹林度假村還有好多空中娛樂項目，直升飛機、滑翔傘都有。酒店邊上有美食街，買東西也很方便。入住期間還看到有人在空中餐廳用餐，下次有機會也來試試。我推薦大家在這裏度過在三亞的愉快假期~~~

服務：酒店的服務可以説是最加分的一項了，不管是前廳，餐廳，客房的服務員幾乎都是有求必應的，尤其是這次管家kobe，入住前就聯繫上，知道我有特殊情況後立馬安排提前入住，整個過程也是事事有迴應，非常熱情，也很貼心的解答我很問題，還會及時提醒我酒店的活動。

餐飲：凱悦旗下的餐飲是真的有保障，早餐和自助晚餐水準都不錯，而且晚餐的時候還有很精彩的表演，本以為衹是給小朋友看的表演，但是看完後發現很多成年人都被吸引，為演職人員的熱情專業點贊。

總體來説，這家店真的是親子家庭遊的不二之選，以後如果是帶父母孩子會是首選。

尤其是我們的管家Kobe特別貼心，會記住我們每個房間喜歡的飲品和需求，後面幾天不需要特別提出就會幫忙備好，很用心了。
酒店整體很不錯，唯一缺點是房間離海灘較遠，長者和孩子步行會比較遠，不過有免費擺渡車也是彌補了這一缺憾。
下次還會去的。

園林式度假酒店也實則是名不虛傳，恍惚中，我都以為回到了幾年前總喜歡晃悠在Bali島或者Spain島的感覺，高大的棕櫚，各色的雞蛋花，艷而不嬌的朱蕉，斑斕的千日紅，鬱鬱葱葱的羊蹄甲。。。還有一些叫不清名字的海島特有植被 。

但酒店的餐飲方面還是着實該提升下了，可能是我比較挑剔吧，酒店控，對食材，口感，味道要求估計都高了一丟丟[破涕為笑]君悦嘛，好歹是Hyyat集團高端系，方方面面都奔着高逼格完善吧，祝Sanya 君悦越來越好

值得一提的是今晨8點30我獨自帶小朋友去酒店外星巴克買咖啡，路上沒什麼人，被一男子尾隨一路到達星巴克後，該男子跟着我們進店後出入兩次不買東西，又在店側假裝打電話…真的很嚇人！ 

我立即聯繫管家希望安排人來接我們，很快值班經理就來接我和孩子……感謝管家Tingger，日常微信回覆都非常及時，還有值班經理王娟女士! 有被保護到比心♥️

總之還是一趟滿意的遊程，希望下次還有機會來住，能給我更多的驚喜。

餐食:酒店早餐的品類很多，口味也還不錯。
拍照:園林裏非常適合拍照，陽光椰樹 綠地 大海這簡直就是一副畫。
房間:躺在床上去感覺睡在了雲朵裏那種感覺。太舒服了，被鋪觸感柔軟，有股乾淨舒適的味道，不是香味，不知道大家懂不？
了。
親子酒店top3不是蓋的，孩子住到不想走，還能額外給孩子在房間安排泡泡浴，姑娘喜歡得不得了外面的泳池共三個。成人泳池和小童泳池都是恆温的。很容易出大片。推薦這家酒店。體驗非常滿意！

酒店非常大，與其説是酒店還不如説是景區，私密性很好，整個海灣和沙灘，可以不關窗簾陽光也不會晃眼睛，第二天睜眼的無邊海景會驚艷你。
整個酒店是到處都是藝術品，一步一景不是吹的，每一處都值得你打卡留步，三亞的酒店住了不少，這算是最有文化有底藴的體現。在酒店逛一天都不會覺得無聊，早上睡到自然醒，咖啡廳的早餐
是自助式，菜系很豐富
最後説一下房間的設計，有大陽台，我覺得這個設計倒是相當驚艷，房間整個縱深是一面無縫玻璃，盡頭用鏡子做了一個延展，把整個海灣的景色全部匡進了房
管家Max服務很好，有需要都幫忙安排 很貼心
總結：酒店太大了，容易迷路心
三亞酒店千千萬，君悦目前心頭愛

君悦的海景也非常棒，浴缸可以直接看到大海，新年期間有外國演員在大堂演出，還有草莓熊和北極熊表演，處處都讓人感受到老牌高端酒店的用心和檔次。下次來海棠灣我希望不止在這裏住一晚，好好感受一下君悦的服務。

位置：位於海棠灣距離免税店3km，特別方便，距離林旺夜市，跳傘基地，滑翔傘也很近，唯一一家步行直達海棠68的酒店，去飯店超市，一站到位，很方便。
服務：有私人管家Max貼心的服務，整個行程變得愉快和輕鬆，在入住之前主動聯繫，詢問來店時間，升級房間，雖然有小不愉快，也幫忙處理，對客户的需求及時回覆，讓客户享受到貼心、尊貴的服務。非常優秀的管家！
衞生：每天打掃及時，乾淨，整潔。多配了很多浴巾和飲水。
早餐：自助早餐樣式多，口味佳，服務好。我們基本在10樓行政酒廊吃的，室外露台無敵海景早餐。自助晚餐也很好吃，性價比很高，實現了炭烤大蝦，烤乳豬和清補涼自由。
酒店合作的高空餐廳項目一定要試一下，非常特別的體驗，住店客人可以打95折。推薦午餐，性價比最高，不推薦下午茶，晚餐也不錯就是風大會涼一些。
酒店的旅拍也可以試一下，冰淇淋車，椰林都很出片。精修60元一張，算很便宜的了。
酒每天都有很多表演和免費的親子項目，豐富多彩。泳池裡設施齊全，也有恆温泳池，很適合小朋友。

我入住的是帶泳池的套房，這個泳池真的是太棒了！孩子們一進入泳池就玩得不亦樂乎，盡情地享受着水上樂趣。我們在泳池裡度過了愉快的時光，孩子們的臉上洋溢着幸福的笑容。泳池的水質非常乾淨，讓人放心。泳池自帶超大火烈鳥，孩子太喜歡了。
除了泳池，酒店還提供了豐富的水果和飲品，這些都是隨叫隨到，非常方便。無論是口渴還是肚子餓，都可以隨時享用這些美味的食物。這些小細節讓我覺得酒店的服務非常周到，真的是用心在為客人提供優質的服務。
整個入住期間，管家的服務都非常到位。他們不僅及時地為我們解決各種問題，還主動詢問我們的需求，為我們提供了很多有用的建議和幫助。這種全程服務的體驗讓我感到非常貼心，也讓我對酒店的服務非常滿意。
嘉賓軒的早餐下午茶都很方便，都是免費的，基本不怎麼需要吃飯了哈哈哈

管家Kobe很好哦，微信上詢問的問題，幾乎秒回，效率非常高。
孩子非常喜歡玩水滑梯，酒店的水滑梯夠大，還是恆温的水池，旁邊的救生員很負責，孩子玩的放心且開心。
離開酒店時好打車，衹是回三亞的路上挺堵車的，司機説旺季從海棠灣回三亞堵車厲害，趕高鐵飛機要提前留出時間。

房間還是一如既往又大又好，但不推薦主樓，我住的方向面對外馬路，看出窗外是工地，完全沒有度假感。之前入住是住在其他樓，雖然二樓看不到海，大家窗户是椰樹，父母很喜歡到陽台坐坐吃東西。

悦趣營非常推薦，椰子老師很温柔，每天都有課程，很適合帶娃得家庭，住了很多酒店，君悦的約課是最方便人性化得一家。


早餐感覺也不錯， 該有的都有，用餐環境也很好，值得一説的是居然有伊比利亞火腿！


酒店的自助晚餐也很不錯，石斑魚新鮮，5歲孩子免費

不足之處希望能注意服務人員的衞生情況，中途有服務員過來幫忙，狐臭太嚴重了，交流幾句趕緊撤。

服務
君悦的管家服務真的很好，到酒店有禮賓同事拿行李，辦完入住就有管家Max帶去房間，一個微信就很方便，在酒店裡遇到服務人員都會主動和我們打招呼、、、
環境
泳池是恆温泳池，每天傍晚會有泡泡秀的活動。
沙灘沙子很細膩，沙灘的視野很開闊，入住期間，沙灘上的人一直不多，體驗還是很不錯的。套餐包含了旅拍，出片率不錯、、、
早餐
自助早餐很豐盛，種類比較多，也好吃，還是可以的。
衝著這次體驗明年來三亞一定還會住君悦的！一次美妙的旅行體驗！
