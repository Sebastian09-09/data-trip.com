msg:We had a great stay at this hotel as the service was impeccable! The front desk personnels were always helpful despite us having troubles navigating JiuZhaiGou. They helped us with purchasing great seats at the Qian Gu Qing show and provide free pickup services to and fro the Jiu Zhai Gou entrance. Special mention to Xiao Liu (小刘）for being really friendly and willingly assist all our questions. The rooms were clean and rather high tech with a full bidet and voice control system throughout the room. There is also a free laundry room for guests to use, which is a plus. The only thing is that it is located at the top of a small hill and there is not a lot of things to explore within walking distance.

One for the pain point would be the location is slightly far from the main tourist area where most of the famous dining restaurant were located at. Will have to call taxi to go for dinner. However, the hotel do provide car pool transport to JiuZhaiGou entrance in the morning.

It should be considered one of the top hotels in Jiuzhaigou.

The housekeeper Xiao Liu was very considerate (high praise) and was very proactive in communicating the estimated arrival time and other information on the phone before we arrived. They took the initiative to give us breakfast and responded to all kinds of questions very quickly. The effective communication rate was too high, which made our stay a great experience.

The breakfast is quite rich, including freshly cooked rice noodles, excellent dishes, bread, coffee, soy milk, etc., which can basically meet everyone's normal needs.

The hotel also has a washing machine and dryer, saving time and energy!
There is absolutely nothing wrong with staying here when you come to Jiuzhaigou.
