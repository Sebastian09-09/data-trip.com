During hot nights, the hotel also kept the aircon on to keep us cool. Location was 3 min walk from exit 7 of metro line 14. 5 min walk to yuyuan garden. 8-10 min walk to the bund/nanjing road.

We stayed a total of 8 nights and halfway through our stay, our housekeeping lady must have noticed we drank alot of water during this dry weather and included additional 2 bottles of water for us. A nice and meticulous touch. We also had a parcel sent to our hotel which Wilson helped to retrieve and also helped with a late check out for us as our flight was not until 7pm. Appreciate the kind gesture! Room 1021 send our regards to the team at blossom house and also the lady who kept giving us additional bottles of drinks daily. Thank you!

Check-in was laborious, on top of being very slow the staff managed to make a mistake, mixing up my booking with another customer‚Äôs booking for a very different type of room. The room I booked had a window was facing inside, the noise insulation with the floor above was very poor and the access to the rooms is done by only 2 elevators, which are always congested during the peak hours (basically all the time)‚Ä¶ globally the hotel is not targeting a very international crowd.

We asked for extra water in the room a few times on the first day, and the next day a very sweet note was waiting for us in our room with extra water. We liked this very much‚ù§ there were also activities for children. We made a very cute bag for my 4-year-old daughter. If I come to Shanghai again, I will definitely stay at the same hotel again.

Room facing Landmark view (a sculpture). Top notch bidet toilet bowl, automatic closure and opening plus heating of the pad. Down side is the room was stuffy and hot during cold season. Heating system is centralised and the most the hotel staff can do is to provide an additional fan in the room to help with the ventilation. Presume this will the problem of most hotel who use centralised heating/cooling system. Staff is accommodating when you ask for their help. Standard of service is acceptable for me.

msg:I stayed here in my last night in Shanghai. Excellent location very close to the bund. The reception is on the seventh floor. The exterior front of the building has a cool gold front. Hip modern interiors.  I had a balcony garden room. Had a glimpse of the bund and overlooked the Yuyuan garden and had good views. Room had a large comfortable bed and a day bed by the window for relaxing. Large bathroom and good shower. Very clean. My rooms decor was great. Green and pink with cool wallpaper. I had a drink and dinner on the top floor. There is also a rooftop area with incredible views of the Bund etc and the lightshow. Staff on the top floor bar were welcoming and friendly. Excellent hotel and a good location, with only a few minutes walk to the Bund and Nanjing Road. Pretty close to the Yuyuan metro station being only about a 5-10 minute flat walk. Not much in the way of facilities at this hotel but met my needs. Highly recommend this hotel to stay at in Shanghai.

The room was nice. Because toilet has bidet which is very rare in china. And not just bidet it is automated like japan. Our room is family room which has balcony. This hotel has no air conditioning during our stay. Weather is not that cold. Location of the hotel is very near everywhere. The bund, oriental pearl, yuyuan road, renmin road etc

The room features a floral-themed romantic design, is spacious, and offers a superb view of Shanghai's magnificent buildings. It's served with fresh fruits, local drinks, and tidbits. The location is convenient and easily accessible by public transport. Highly recommended!

msg:It was a very pleasant stay for 4 nights at Bund-view King Room with a luxury bund view. Let alone the wonderful Bund view, convenient locality, the service provided throughout my stay is fantastic. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the cleaning staff at level 12. They made me feel that I am at home. The room is clean everyday. They refill the mineral water, fruits and other stuff like toiletries sufficiently every day. You can even ask for more and get it instantly whenever you request. The leaning staff at level 12, especially Madam Lin Ying Huan (ÊûóÈì∂ÁéØÔºåhopefully I remember her name correctly) is so attentive, polite and hardworking. I even received a small but warm gesture from her which was a note in the bar to advise me to take care of myself, drink more water while the weather in Shanghai was very hot during the last 2 days of my stay. She even provided the extra mineral water for the guests not only me, but also others. With such heartwarming and lovely service provided from the bottom of the service staff, I will definitely recommend this hotel to anyone. For sure, I will stay in Blosom House whenever I travel to Shanghai, China.

Once again, thanks to the cleaning staff Madam Lin at level 12, and manager Mr. Sun Chun Lei (Â≠ôÊò•Èõ∑Ôºâwho also gave me a very good service during my stay.

I loved the toilet and towel heating rack, and the balcony offered a nice view of Yuyuan at night. The tub was nice, but because it's not attached to the floor it leaked all over the bathroom area floor, so be mindful of that, and the elevators always took a while but that can't really be helped. All in all, if we ever opted to stay on the Bund again, we'd likely book here again.

Service staff was okay, although they didn't make a very good first impression - I had arrived at hotel at 6pm and they told me the room wasn't ready. I told the staff that check in time is 3pm and it's shocking that by 6pm no room is ready?? They immediate apologise and assigned 1 room for us.

Breakfast spread was decent for my 4 days stay but I think the hotel can change the buffet spread more... It was boring to eat same food few days in a row.

The room is very spacious, so it's value for money. I'm also very impressed by Chinese technology as they used robots to deliver our food! Fantastic stuff.

I'll recommend to stay at this hotel for tourists and visitors.

msg:Stayed in this hotel. Great experience. Roof top bar, especially rooms with patio are great. Interior is clean and modern. Reception area is on 7th floor. A little weird. Parking is good. 2 minutes to Yuyuan and the Bund. Staff is friendly. Food is great and lots of choices. Price is fair considering everything. Elevator is a little slow.

I loved the design of the room, super spacious and a lot of nice features - a nespresso machine in the room, minibar with items on the house, lots of storage space and shelves to put/hang your things, toilet seat opens, closes, flushes automatically, toilet is separate from bathroom. Great shower and bathtub with separate doors. You can see the hotel is quite new. The balcony was definitely an added bonus, and there was a sliding door with mosquito net, so you can leave it open, enjoy the fresh breeze at night without having to worry about mosquitoes. For breakfast, you can choose a Chinese or Western version, and there are some additional items (coffee, freshly made eggs, bacon, Chinese pancake, veggies and other items) on the buffet. I chose the Chinese version and they were also able to accommodate vegetarians and vegans. The breakfast was good, fresh and plentiful. The service was very good.

We were greeted and helped with our bags as soon as we arrived. The checking in was a bit long because we were foreigners, but they made sure that any issue we had they took care of. Everything was really clean, the view of the city was great because we had the balcony. The bathroom had a premier toilet to take care of all your needs and the shower was spacious and had the option for a handheld or rainfall. And if you ordered food they brought it to your door by either the staff or their robot. I would definitely recommend anyone to stay here. Especially for couples as it was our anniversary.

I will be looking at staying here again in a few weeks time when I need to collect my passport.

There is a fire; cosy seating areas and a large bay window where I spent the first afternoon relaxing and enjoying their afternoon tea. My room was large; well decorated; clean; comfortable bed and the deepest bathtub I‚Äôve ever seen (it was amazing). The mini bar was stocked and included. I had a courtyard but didn‚Äôt use it due to weather and sadly a neighbour above spitting into it ü§¢
We ate in the restaurant the first night and whilst the food was good I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it for Westerners. We were asked if we had a reservation three times to which we said no (only a handful of tables were sat). We sat down and we‚Äôre asked what we wanted to drink, I answered and as my friend began to speak she walked away to greet two guests who entered- she never asked my friend again who just decided to stay with the water provided. There is no menu translation; the menu is only available on the iPad and the waitress wouldn‚Äôt leave it with us to translate, she just hovered asking us what we wanted repeatedly as if in a hurry. This was on a Monday, with four other tables sat. I ordered the soda water which was poured from a can into a glass that it didn‚Äôt fill but the can was taken away so I couldn‚Äôt use the rest of it.  The food was tasty and served quickly. 
I would recommend the restaurant on the top floor - the staff are attentive; the decor is Alice in Wonderland and the roof terrace is quirky and cool with a view of the Bund.
The lobby staff were always welcoming and polite and even helped us set up the hotel on our ‚Äòwaimai‚Äô apps so we could order pizza for one night to chill in our rooms.
The hotel is exquisite; comfortable; well located and 99% of the staff are outstanding so I‚Äôd definitely stay again.

msg:The SERVICE-received at this hotel was exceptional. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left, staff could not do enough to help us! We needed to check out earlier than planned and a member of staff advised me to call a trip agent to request a part refund. I did so and the refund was processed within half an hour! 

LOCATION- excellent! The hotel is within a very short walking distance to the Bund. It took us less than 10 minutes to walk to the wonderful Lost Heaven restaurant which is also beside a Moroccan restaurant and the Italian, Goodfellas. Waldorf Astoria is also within walking distance!

Just across the road from the hotel is a Family mart.

ROOM- we had booked a superior Family and were upgraded to a Deluxe Family which was spacious, clean and had a little balcony. The bathroom is great, it‚Äôs like a wet room with an overhead rainfall shower which also has a separate moveable head and beside it there is a big bath tub.

AMENITIES-Due to many facilities and services still being closed, the gym was not open to guests and a buffet breakfast was not available. We had paid for breakfast and so were served with a menu from which to choose. The service at breakfast was again superb and the breakfast was nice!

We thoroughly enjoyed our one night stay here and will definitely book again when we are back In Shanghai

It turned out to be worth the money. The hotel's location is very good. It is convenient to go to Yu Garden and the Bund. It is very convenient to walk. The hotel thoughtfully upgraded me to a city superior king room. The location and view are very good. You can see the Oriental Pearl Tower. The breakfast is rich and delicious. The room is also very design-conscious, clean and bright. A small gift was given when I checked out. It was full of sincerity. I will choose Huajiantang again when I come to Shanghai next time!

Snacks and drinks are provided on the first night. As soon as you enter the lobby, you take the initiative to help the elderly with their luggage and deliver takeaways.

msg:There is a parallel road to the Bund. Some rooms and the restaurant on the seventh floor can see the Huangpu River from the gap.
There is a reception in the lobby on the first floor. The hotel lobby is on the seventh floor, and the guest rooms are above the seventh floor.
I have stayed in Huajiantang on Shantang Street in Suzhou, which is a big house in ancient houses, and Huajiantang in Xinchaoli, Slender West Lake in Yangzhou, which has a unique breakfast and is particularly good.
I used to buy a set meal coupon in Beijing Houhai and Huajiantang in Suzhou Tanhua Mansion. I chose Huajiantang in Happy Garden, Shanghai Bund. There is nothing else to do on this trip. It is a special check-in experience.
The hotel is not located on the front street of the Bund, but on a narrow street behind it. It is a seven or eight minute walk from the subway station. The bus is slightly closer, and there is a 930 line that can go directly to Shanghai Railway Station.
Two elevators are connected, the first floor goes directly to the lobby on the seventh floor, and the seventh floor goes to the guest room area above, which usually takes 2-3 minutes.
The king-size room is not large in size, the facilities are basically complete, the external window can be opened outward, and the air permeability is satisfactory. Welcome fruits and small refrigerators, drinks and snacks are free, full of sincerity.
The bathroom is separated into dry and wet areas, and the three zones are reasonable.
The bedding is comfortable, and the light intensity is divided into three levels, but I didn't find the night light mode.
The breakfast is rich in variety and good quality, and the coffee is of good quality. I didn't catch up with the supply of wontons for two days, which is not available every day; there are noodles, and the toppings are very good.
The service is proactive from the first floor reception to the seventh floor lobby reception, and timely communication. The check-out was delayed to 2 pm on the day. While waiting in the sofa area in the lobby, there were also service staff who took the initiative to bring water, which was warm.
A pleasant stay experience.

The room size is OK, at least it is suitable for us, an old man and a child, and the beds cannot be too close. But it is strange that there is no partition between the bathtub and the shower. And the socket of the shower head is loose, and the price of 2000+ per night should also pay attention to maintenance. The quilt cover was a little rotten when we checked in.
The service is OK. There were some misunderstandings on the day of check-in due to some reasons, and the staff was also very active in communication and resolution. Thank you for your service.

The hotel organized a citywalk event, which was very meaningful. The tour guide Lao Xu is a Shanghainese and told many historical stories of the Bund in Shanghai. It was very rewarding.

msg:I feel that the rooms in Huajiantang are well-selected, well-designed, and the operation needs to be improved. Not to the level of a five-star hotel.

Advantages: Convenient location, right next to Yuyuan Garden and close to Line 14. The room is large and there is a small eating corner in the original room. The bath and toilet are two separate spaces, each with a wash basin for the family to freshen up in the morning. There are thoughtful gadgets such as smart toilet boards and earplugs, and there are plenty of snacks and drinks. My favorite is the heated towel rack. Clothes are warm and comfortable to wear, and towels dry quickly when hung on it. The front desk and cleaning staff are friendly and respond quickly to inquiries.

Disadvantages: The facilities are poorly maintained and hygienic, the furniture and bedding are shabby, especially the pillow cloth is stained and smells of oil. After all, it is so disgusting to touch your face directly. The system also started to go wrong. When I first checked in in the afternoon, I noticed that the bathroom had a strong smell of urine. I immediately reported it to the service desk. When I came back in the evening, the smell was still the same. It must be that the ventilation was broken. I waited for a long time before the maintenance staff came. When I arrived, I just kept saying it was okay with a face that smelled worse than the toilet. Finally, I asked the front desk to change to a smaller room. The elevator often breaks down and cannot close the door. It is slow and small, and the food delivery robot cannot get in if it occupies the space. Instead of asking guests to leave positive reviews on site, it‚Äôs better to put more effort into improving quality.

msg:I went on a two-day Shanghai city walk with my husband and daughter. I compared many hotels and finally chose Huajiantang. Take Line 10, get off at Exit 7, and walk to the hotel in 5 minutes. There is a doorman at the door to help with the luggage. Check in is on the 7th floor. After checking in, the front desk gave 3 toiletries bags, and the children's ones have very cute cartoon patterns, which is very thoughtful! The room is on the 9th floor. Although it is an old hotel, the hygiene level is good. The mini bar in the room can be eaten for free, and the toilet and bathroom are also separated into dry and wet areas. After putting away the luggage, the three of us immediately went to the food. It is only about 3 kilometers away from the famous old alleys in the west of Shanghai, and shared bicycles can settle everything. The most surprising thing is that the hotel is super close to the Bund, and it can be reached in 3 minutes on foot. It is strongly recommended that everyone go to the nearby Bund and Yu Garden at night. It has the characteristics of Shanghai's petty bourgeoisie. The next day, the hotel's breakfast is also very good, with a rich variety. The opening hours are from 7:00 to 10:30. If the dishes are missing, they will be replenished in time. The hotel staff are also very enthusiastic and patient. In short, it is a very good stay experience, recommended~

For example, it only takes seven to ten minutes to walk to the Bund, Yuyuan Old Street, Chenghuang Temple, Shiliupu Pier for a night cruise on the Huangpu River, etc. The scenic area is close to the subway station, with convenient transportation and extending in all directions. The "three-piece kitchen set" and the Oriental Pearl Tower can be vaguely seen at the hotel waiting for the elevator. It is still beautiful when taking night photos. The overall cleanliness is perfect. The service is first-class and courteous.

If you go out after 8 pm, you don't have to book a cruise in advance. There are not many people after May Day. When you go there, you can directly catch the 9:15 pm boat. It's good.

I like the decoration style of the hotel, it's very romantic. There are fruits and several kinds of drinks in the room this time, which is very rich. The service at the hotel is also good, including help with luggage during check-in and check-out. The hotel is very close to the Bund and Yuyuan Garden. The Bund is crowded and lively. The ancient city park next to it is quiet and peaceful, suitable for travel and leisure vacations. I like the books in the room. The lighting in the room is very suitable for reading. I spent a quiet day reading in the room.

The reason is to be closer to the Bund, and the hotel is in a good location. Talking about the hotel itself, the service is very good and the room is cleaned in a timely manner. The hotel facilities are relatively new, and the toilets and bathrooms are separated from wet and dry areas. The breakfast is rich and the fruit in the room is fresh. I like the smell of aromatherapy very much. The overall fragrance of the hotel is high-end, not pungent, and just right. It was a relatively satisfactory accommodation experience. I will choose Huajiantang again if necessary in the future.

It is very close to Yuyuan subway station. It is first-rate whether you go to Nanjing Road, Disney, the Bund or Lujiazui. I hope to stay here again next time I come to Shanghai.

The decoration is very particular and uses a lot of copper-colored metal, which shows that the investors spent a lot of money to build it. The hotel's breakfast is rich in variety and tastes excellent, and the service attitude at the front desk is also good. Very nice. The carpet in the corridor is very soft. When we entered the room, we saw a fruit plate and water carefully prepared for us. There was also beer and drinks in the refrigerator below. The bedding was very clean and fragrant!
The bathroom and shower are separate which feels unique. Now there is Xinrui Travel Photography, which can provide us with personal check-in photos for free. The results are pretty good.

However, the feeling when I arrived at the hotel made me regret my choice. I read a lot of online reviews about this hotel. Yes, I really don‚Äôt know how you experience it. First of all, the hotel checks in on the 7th floor. When you get to the first floor, there is no one to say hello, let alone helping you carry your luggage. There is a security guard at the door. , there is basically no service. I really don‚Äôt know how you got the five diamonds. Let's talk about the front desk. There is no welcome tea and no warm service at all. Is this the store that is bullying customers? But your hotel is not big. When you checked in, you asked for the room at the far end. Haha, the room at the far end was arranged. I might as well not say it. There is a 50% chance. Besides, Talking about the room, it was too small, long and slender, and didn‚Äôt even have a table. The main reason was that it couldn‚Äôt fit in. When I called the hotel front desk at 10 o‚Äôclock in the evening, no one answered the phone. What kind of service is this? Did you get off work so early? The information shows a 24-hour front desk service. I don‚Äôt know if the floor in the room is just like this or dirty. You can look at the pictures. They say there is a package or something, but I didn‚Äôt see it. The front desk was also very cold when checking out. Maybe they are busy. The room for 1,500 yuan is really good. Not worth it, please choose carefully. I rarely give negative reviews to others. This time I am really disappointed. I trust Huazhu, but this time...

It's close to the subway station, and even next to Yuwon and the city tour bus stop... It's a hotel in a great location.
However, the room with a view of the inside of the building rather than a city view was very stuffy, and I think I should definitely reserve a city view room next time. The mattress was so soft that I fell asleep easily, but the lighting at the entrance was a sensor light, so it was very dark and uncomfortable to pack. It lacks a clean feel in every corner and the building itself has an old exterior, which is a bit disappointing, but other than this, I really liked the view from the 7th floor lobby and breakfast restaurant.

1. The hotel is very beautiful and is mainly decorated with flowers. The room is very princess-like. Girls should like it very much. The room is large and the facilities and equipment are very smart.
2. The hotel's breakfast is very rich and the taste is a bit Cantonese-style. You can admire the Oriental Pearl Tower while waiting for the elevator in the hotel
3. The room type we chose has a balcony. Unified on the 10th floor. Facing Yu Garden.
4. The hotel does not use the children's playground, so I don't know if there is one.
5. The personal consumables provided by the hotel are very exquisite, and the combs are also made of wood.
I have to say that the service is quite satisfactory and there is no personalized service. The price of 1,600 per night is probably better than the location.

The subway and taxis are very convenient. The room is soundproofed, new facilities, clean and hygienic.
I would like to highlight the service. I booked a double bed with a window for two nights. I was exempted from upgrading to a terrace room for my first stay. On the second day, the hotel learned that my child was sick and stayed in the original room type, and also delayed check-out. Very user-friendly!
It was my first time to stay at a hotel owned by Huazhu. I checked that many cities have Huajiantang, and I will include it in my future travel choices.

The bathroom is separated from wet and dry, and the facilities are very new, especially the drying rack in the washroom, which is particularly practical. However, there is no anti-slip mat in the shower room, so it is easy to accidentally fall. Although the open-air view of the room is mediocre, the hotel has a strong New Year a**osphere and the customer service is satisfactory. It's a pity that the buffet for the New Year's Eve dinner is really not good. I heard several guests complaining that the 398 yuan/person is not worth it.

With your family, if you want to visit the Bund, Yuyuan Garden or Nanjing Road, this is a good choice.

The hotel environment is clean and tidy, the room layout is perfect, elegant yet elegant, and the service is considerate, which makes people feel extremely comfortable.
The child received meticulous care when he was sick, and what was even more heartwarming was that the kitchen was arranged to stew pear and white fungus soup for the child for two hours. The waiter Zhang Zhen comes every two hours to care about the child's condition and the services he needs. It created a feeling of home for me, no matter how big or small it was, it was impeccable.
I give you a piece of warmth and a piece of affection! Yuyuan will accompany you to have a pleasant holiday. Yuyuan will be my only choice in Shanghai.

Things I‚Äôm not used to:
~The automatic sensor in the bathroom opens the toilet. It looks like technology but is actually a bit too thoughtful. It often opens inexplicably and leaves some odor.
~The four areas of washroom, dressing table, toilet and shower room are independent of each other, which is very considerate. Unfortunately, there is no partition/blocking between these four areas and the bedroom, so it‚Äôs a bit awkward to change clothes after taking a showerüòÖ

The charm of Magic City lies not only in its bustling urban scenery, but also in its unique cultural connotation and historical heritage. Choosing accommodation in Huajiantang Yuyuan was the icing on the cake for our trip. The hotel's excellent location, comfortable hotel facilities, and warm service details... brought us too many surprises and touches. My mother told me to thank the front desk staff, Xiao Long, for taking the initiative to upgrade the room service and delay check-out in order for the elderly to have a better rest. I also want to thank the cleaning sister who is very friendly and enthusiastically sent anti-slip mats. Remind us to pay attention to safety when traveling. It turns out that the beauty of a journey cannot be separated from every moment of love.

msg:The hotel is truly the best. Perhaps because we were in a suite, welcome fruit and minibar were all free. My family and I had a hard time eating Chinese food, so we rarely ate out, but the hotel provided plenty of food and drinks, so we didn't have to worry about eating.
Perhaps because it was Chris**as Eve or because it was a weekend, there was a special buffet, but it was nothing like the 5-star breakfast at a Seoul hotel. Although I was surprised by the decrease in the number of items on weekdays. Tea, snacks, and apples served 24 hours a day in the lobby are delicious. It was a shame that I couldn't try the night soup provided in the evening.
The location is a bit far from tourist attractions other than Yu Garden, but taxis in Shanghai are cheap, so the location is not a problem. It is 3 minutes away from Exit 7 of Yewon Line 14, 3 minutes away from the entrance to Yewon Shopping Mall, and 5-7 minutes to the Bund night view spot. It's really close to the subway, but on the way there is a flat area with no hills. As soon as you come out of Exit 7, you can see the hotel building and it's right across the crosswalk. Taxis are also readily available. If you say Huajiantang Yuyuan, I understand.
Although it was Chris**as season, there seemed to be almost no foreigners. The main language used is Chinese. It's a bit inconvenient, but you can communicate well using a mobile phone translator. Even if you can't communicate well, please be kind and do your best to help.
The water came out and drained well. It was my first time using the AHABA brand of amenities and it was quite good. On other trips, the electric pot was dirty, so I brought my own pot, but this was clean. The heating was warm, the floor was wooden, not carpeted, and it was clean. The bed was firm, soft, big, and nice. The winter indoor gown packaging said I could purchase it if I wanted, but I regret not buying it. So good.
My parents are picky, but they said what they liked most about Shanghai was the hotel.
For reference, I purchased an anniversary package from Klook and stayed for 3 days and 2 nights in a city king room and 1 night in a suite at Klook, and the city king room was better. The city king room has a window, and if you get a room on a high floor, you can see the Oriental Pearl Tower from the room. There are ventilated windows.
The junior suite is said to have a landmark view, but it has a view of the indoor sculpture garden and has no windows, so ventilation is poor. I just liked the bathtub. I think a terrace room would be better, so I'd like to stay in a terrace room next time. If I come to Shanghai, I will definitely stay at this hotel again.
The conversation didn't go well, but I was grateful. Let's meet again:)

Small disadvantages There is only one elevator leading to the parking lot. Sometimes you have to wait for a while.

Unexpectedly, my boyfriend secretly called the hotel to arrange a proposal scene and order a bouquet. So as soon as I entered, there was a beautiful bouquet on the dressing table, and there were fake petals and swans on the bed. It was really romantic!
The mini bar offers different drinks for free every day (including beer). Our favorites are beer and white peach flavored soda.
The hotel's breakfast buffet is delicious, and there are some local Shanghai foods every day, which suits my tasteüòç.
Free moisturizing sugar water is provided at 8 o'clock every night, and you can pick it up in the lobby. This is very comforting and a plus! Ôøº
If you order takeout, you don‚Äôt have to go downstairs to pick it up yourself. They have a robot that delivers it to your door. The robot will even call you to ask you to open the door to pick up the takeout. It‚Äôs super convenient!
The location is very good, within walking distance to Yuyuan Garden, the Bund and other places. Ôøº

Disadvantages: Unfortunately, it was not very cold when we arrived in Shanghai in the first two days. It was 22-23 degrees in the afternoon. When we walked outside to Wuhan and returned to the hotel, we were told that there is no air conditioning in winter, and the air conditioning becomes only cold. Heating, but my partner and I were extremely hot in the hotel. The staff asked us to open the floor-to-ceiling glass doors on the terrace to ventilate the room, but to be honest, this was very unsettling. In addition, there was construction going on in the hotel at the time, which made it even more unsettling. And I have tracheal sensitivity. After opening the door, I kept smelling the smell of second-hand smoke, which was very uncomfortable. Ôøº
In addition, when I checked in on the first day, I was told that a cake would be delivered, but it didn't show up after staying for four nights. But we were full every day, so we didn't ask, but it was always disappointing. Ôøº
When we said it was very hot, the front desk said they would try to find an air cooler for us. However, after waiting all night, no one informed us whether they had found it. I felt that their service was not attentive enough.
I think the staff should be more smiling and enthusiastic. I feel that most of the staff in the hotel are relatively indifferent and the welcome service that a five-star hotel should have is not in place, so I deducted one star in this regard.

msg:This is the second time I have stayed in Shanghai Huajiantang Yuyuan. It was so noisy that I couldn't sleep all night. The roar of air conditioners in other buildings outside the window and the unknown roar in the corridors were very noisy even with earplugs. There was actually noise from construction or the garbage disposal station at two o'clock in the middle of the night. Closing the windows and wearing earplugs didn't help. It was not good for a business trip, and it felt too bad! I won‚Äôt choose Huajiantang Yuyuan next time

They considered that the room had not been cleaned yet, and the hotel was very warm and helped us upgrade the room type to a higher level. It was a great feeling when we checked in!

Talking about the hotel itself, the service is very good and the room is cleaned in a timely manner. The hotel facilities are relatively new, and the toilets and bathrooms are separated from wet and dry areas. The breakfast is rich and the fruit in the room is fresh.
I like the smell of aromatherapy very much. The overall fragrance of the hotel is high-end, not pungent, and just right.
It was a relatively satisfactory accommodation experience. I will choose Huajiantang again if necessary in the future.

There are many, the bathroom, shower room, and dressing table are three independent spaces, which do not interfere with each other, and are very thoughtful. It is recommended to stay here if you come to the Bund. Other hotels are a bit old.
Welcome fruits: good quality, many five-star hotels have average fruits. Overall, a hotel that pays more attention to details.

msg:The location of the hotel is very good. There are walking attractions nearby (Yu Garden and City God Temple). The Bund is a little further away, about 20 minutes' walk away, which is perfect for digesting food after a meal. The transportation is also very convenient. Station 10/14 is nearby and you can walk in a few minutes. There are many fly restaurants downstairs, so you don't have to worry about late-night snacks (similar to a village in the city).
Environment: The layout is very designed and looks good, but the first impression is that the lighting is a bit poor. The room we stayed in happened to be the same, with only a small window, but we left early and came back late, so it was okay. There is no odor, and the air conditioning fresh air system is really good.
Hygiene: Not bad, looks very clean! The wooden floor has been used for a long time, has many scratches, and looks old and dirty.
Service: Very good. The staff are very enthusiastic. There were not many people when we went there. They upgraded our room for us. It was a very comfortable stay for these three days! I also helped put away the baby's water bottle that I missed during breakfast. I was really happy to get it back.
I think the breakfast buffet is quite rich in variety, tastes good, and has items suitable for babies.

Next time I stay here, it will be more affordable to order takeaways and have them delivered by robots.

They recommended it last time I stayed. Each of our guests bought a gold card from their Huazhu Club, which can provide breakfast during their stay.

Whether it was the front desk, the restaurant, or the guest rooms, they all had a condescending face, and the expressions of discrimination in various languages ‚Äã‚Äãwere arranged. The room we checked in had a musty smell, the welcome fruit was thrown carelessly into the fat man, and no knives and forks were prepared for useüç¥. You are not allowed to hang up the room bill when you go to the restaurant. There is no one to serve you during the meal. When paying in cash, you have to sign and write the room number for internal review. , a series of unruly cooking, I asked if this is a discount for in-house guests? Once I took out the gold card membership, I can get a discount, but I did not book through their system. My gold card cannot be used. This is outrageous and overriding the guests. Managers of Huajiantang, you must understand that whether I am Whether I book on Ctrip or on your system, I am a user of your hotel products. Your gold card was not given to me by you but purchased with my own real money. You are not qualified to use any excuse to cancel my rights. Prices are rising rapidly. Please do your best to provide basic hotel services. We deserve a room worth 1,677 yuan without any exalted services, but the basic standards of a high-end hotel must be met. The electric iron in the guest room is leaking conductivity. This There are problems everywhere but you don't pay attention to them. I made six phone calls at noon. At the same time, it took an hour and a half to get back the second electric iron. I don't know whether Huajiantang's various behaviors this time are due to the overall decline in service level or Because I was flagged, I don‚Äôt dare to stay in any of the Huajiantang hotels anymore. It‚Äôs really a nigh**are. I don‚Äôt know where these service staff got the capital to treat guests like this. Please always remember that what you charge is high-end.

1. Accommodation location:
(1) It is very close to public transportation. You can take the sightseeing city bus to the Bund and Nanjing Pedestrian Street, and you can take 911 or 926 from Wukang Road.
(2) There are many restaurants nearby: Yuyuan Garden is across the road, and there are many local delicacies next to it.
2. Hardware and room facilities:
(1) The decoration of public facilities is beautiful, novel and fragrant
(2) This room type is large and has a small living room, suitable for a few friends to have a drink. There is also a triple room type, suitable for tour groups with an odd number of people.
(3) The room facilities are clean and beautiful, with separate bathroom and toilet, a bathtub and a flush toilet
(4) This room type faces the atrium and is a bit boring. It is recommended that you spend a little money to upgrade the room type.
3. Personnel services:
(1) The reception staff and housekeeper Lily are very friendly and enthusiastic. If you have any questions, you can ask and solve them on WeChat. Thank you very much for helping us a lot.
(2) The cleaning staff are very kind and polite, the room cleaning is professional, and the supplies are fully stocked.
4. Summary:
In short, if a few friends are staying together, I highly recommend this accommodation. The overall value for money is very good. If I visit Shanghai again, I will definitely visit this accommodation again.

And the bathroom area is very large. The hotel bed was very comfortable. There are free fruits, mineral water and various drinks in the refrigerator for guests. The service at the hotel is also very good. We just arrived at the hotel. There was a waiter who helped us with our luggage and took us upstairs because the front desk was on the seventh floor. The decorative lights at the entrance on the first floor of the hotel are also very beautiful.
    The two eldest sisters, one named Zhang Zhen, are very enthusiastic. We returned to the hotel at noon and she was cleaning the room next to us. As soon as he saw us coming back, he took the initiative to ask us what services we needed. We said we needed to clean out the trash can. She cleaned up for us right away.
  The hotel is in a great location. It is very close to Yuyuan Garden, City God Temple and the Bund. It is also very close to Nanjing Road. You can get there in no time by riding a shared bicycle.
  Our rooms have balconies and are friendly to smokers.
  If I have any suggestions for the hotel, it would be that the trash can is a bit small. Or it would be better to put an extra trash can.

msg:The room is large, the decoration is unique, and the location is very good. However, the basement of the hotel is shared, and the guest rooms on the seventh floor are directly connected to the lobby, so there is no privacy at all. If you ask for a quiet room when booking a room, the first two times you were given a room in the elevator or passageway, until you strongly requested it, you would be moved to a quiet place. Moreover, the second room given was not ventilated and had a smell, which even the front desk admitted. Breakfast varieties are not high quality. Although the service staff have good attitudes, their overall quality is not high. This is considered a luxury hotel in the Huazhu system, but compared with international and domestic chain luxury hotels, there is still a big gap.

But it's definitely worth it, the price/performance ratio is very high, and the location is very convenient. When you leave the hotel entrance, there are old-fashioned old Shanghai shops on the left, and new restaurants and family mart on the right. 5 minutes walk to the Bund and Yu Garden, it is too positive.
The room has a large sense of space and modern design, and the layout around the hotel is full of modern digital art, with a first-class artistic sense.
The only fly in the oin**ent is that the bedding is not thick enough (or soft enough). The bed and pillows are very good, but the duvet is not as comfortable as ÔøºConradÔøº/Marriott.

msg:Spending 2,437 yuan for one night, it was a surprise!
A typical Internet celebrity hotel, well marketed, probably spent a lot of money to buy it.
Designer hotel? ! This designer is also weak and tarnishes the word "art".
As for the advantages, it is a hotel with a nice name and proper marketing methods to attract traffic purely for the purpose of making money.

The elevator is blocked, there are still hairs in the bathroom (hurry up and buy alcohol to disinfect), I have never been out on the terrace, there is no need to go out, there is no view. The dining area feels like it's put together, with a few tables set up. If the price is less than 500 yuan, you may consider it due to the location. More than two thousand, what a rip off! My daughter said: Mom, please leave quickly.

Why does Ctrip promote this hotel so much? How much benefit did you receive? Are you still familiar with big data? Angry!

The system supports reviews and rewards points. I wonder if I will be rejected if I put all my effort into writing. Forget about killing it. Anyway, a hotel like this will become less and less popular if it relies on real word of mouth. I reported the problem and helped him. If he is killed, I will wait until it closes down.

msg:The hotel's location is in a prime location on the Bund in Shanghai, making it very convenient for work and travel. But the hotel room is very, very small, and the room facilities are rudimentary. Apart from a bed, there is not even a stool with a backrest in the room. This is very unreasonable not only for business trips, but also for vacations. You can't just go to bed as soon as you get back to the hotel, right?
In addition, the hotel is marked as being built in 2020, but the equipment inside is not that new and is not well maintained. The hotel's services are also average, far behind most five-star hotels.
If you are used to staying in five-star hotels, I suggest you not to have high expectations for the hotel.

It was just that when we checked in by car together during peak hours, it was a bit difficult to park in the underground garage of her house. It is said that the garage belongs to the building, and they were not very good at coordinating. The room type I booked in advance is a family room, with a 1.8-meter bed and a 1.35-meter small bed. The room is not small, with a bathtub, and it costs about 2,000 a night. Her house also provides different sweet soups next to the front desk at 8 o'clock every night for the tenants to take by themselves. What impresses me is that the room attendants will replenish more mineral water in this season, and attach handwritten warm stickers.

msg:A very design hotel, very grand! I have recommended it to many friends. It is a good choice to stay in the Bund!
      In addition, special thanks go to little sister Zhang Zhen from the housekeeping depar**ent. Because her two children are very naughty, they have been a little angry these days and feel stuffy in the room. After Zhang Zhen found out, she not only sent a lot of mineral water and fruits to dispel the fire, but was also considerate. I sent a fan and thanked the hotel for such meticulous and thoughtful service! All positive reviews!

Our family traveled to the mainland and Shanghai for the first time. Huajiantang let us from the beginning of check-in to the departure. The impression of the hotel and Shanghai is full of joy~
The waiters at Huajiantang are all kind and gentle
Stayed for 3 nights and didn't want to leave~
There is a lovely and professional waiter Yuan Yayun at the front desk
Help us check in without being in a hurry~
Also help to upgrade the room! big surprise~
Careful housekeeping staff every day
Help to clean up the room, and will be very considerate to observe what drinks we prefer, and add more in the refrigerator
Not to mention breakfast!
Different dishes every day are super full
In the evening, you can go to the bar on the top floor to have a good drink
You can also admire Shanghai's famous 4-piece set
It's really great here
Next time I come to Shanghai, I will definitely choose Huajiantang again.

First of all, the room type is indescribably small, not as good as some express hotels, and I have never seen such a small room type. The merchant cleverly played the number game, saying that the area of ‚Äã‚Äã23 square meters was marked, but the actual accommodation area was only a dozen square meters. Secondly, the language of the hotel service staff was inconsistent. When I reported that the room type did not match the actual situation, they first said that there was no room to adjust, and later said that they would pay for an upgrade when it was very late. The quilt and sheets in the room are very damp, and the air conditioner in the room feels stuffy when it is turned on at 25 degrees, and the cold wind blows against the bed when it is turned on at 24 degrees. Not suitable for parents and children, not suitable for family travel, not suitable for people who pursue quality of life. I don't know how come so many good reviews?

The room was very spacious and we, 3 adults and 2 children, had a very comfortable stay
The hotel's breakfast is quite rich, and children's tableware is also provided. We have friends who don't come down to eat, so they can take it to the room to eat.
We live on the 13th floor, and you can see the Oriental Pearl Tower when you get out of the elevator. However, on our last night, we originally wanted our children to take pictures, but we found that the large window next to the elevator was open. We should pay attention to safety hazards and it is recommended to lock it. I told the hotel staff the next day, but I don‚Äôt know if they took it into consideration.
Overall, I was very satisfied and comfortable with my stay. My friends also said that they would stay here again next time.

The hotel staff are patient, attentive and proactive.
Recommend and like!

msg:The overall feeling is good. The selected room type has a strong sense of satisfaction with the river view, which is a plus. I personally like the design style and feeling of Huajiantang very much. The details are well done, and it is worth choosing
However, there are still some gaps than I expected:
1. There was still no room at the store after 3 o'clock. Although I waited for a short while, it should not have happened. Moreover, the follow-up processing, explanation and comfort to the guests during the check-in process were not enough
2. The rights and interests of the welcome fruit have not been implemented. I don‚Äôt know if I didn‚Äôt want it or what. I didn‚Äôt give it until I left the store.
3. The hygienic details of the room are still flawed, perhaps due to eviction, there are omissions, food debris on the carpet, and the dust under the sofa is not cleaned properly. Regarding the positioning and price of Huajiantang, there should be some omissions in details
4. After check-out, the Aunt PA in the public area showed a little lack of service awareness and status. Guiding and cleaning were like cleaning in a small hotel that lacks training. My overall impression of Huajiantang
5. Pay attention to the inspection and maintenance of the curtains in the room. The electric switch control is not in place. If you can‚Äôt pull it to the end, it will leak light. You can only close it manually. Check and repair it in time, otherwise the curtain motor and gear will be worn out if you pull it manually many times.

Above, a few details, hope to pay attention to improvement, look forward to getting better and better

Thank you for the nice staff in the production depar**ent of your hotel. It made me feel welcome and valued. The room is very comfortable and very comfortable. Unique, it gave me the confidence that I can choose local hotels instead of international brands. In the past, I would choose chain brands like Marriott Hilton or Grand Hyatt for business trips. You did this in Shanghai, which made me change my mind. I hope to be able to stay in other cities in the future. I can stay in the hotels operated by your brand. Thank you. Highly recommend

The bedding is comfortable, the bathroom and toilet are separated from wet and dry, and the toilet is fully automatic. The afternoon tea snacks are very delicate and delicious, and the variety of the buffet breakfast is also very rich. The location is very good and it is convenient to travel. There is also a special toiletry bag for children to check in, which is cute in shape, and there is also a bath toy little yellow duck. The children are super happy, and the hotel is very considerate. The reception service at the front desk is very good, and they help solve any problems in time.

msg:Overall, it was a very satisfying stay!
The location is very good, next to my mother's favorite old sister's Chenghuang Temple Yuyuan Garden, just a few minutes walk to the core area.
The decoration of the hotel is very distinctive. It is not the same style as ordinary high-star hotels. It is small but very textured.
Secondly, when I checked in, I went there relatively early, and I asked if I could change from the family room to a room with a better view (because we actually have two people who can‚Äôt live in the family room), the lady at the front desk was listening After meeting my needs, I changed to a double room with a view, and I can move in immediately. As soon as I entered, I was facing the three-piece suite, happy! satisfy!
Although the room is smaller than the family room, it is more than enough for two people, and the bathroom is very big! ! ! Mini bar six-piece set, welcome fruits are free. When I checked in, I made an appoin**ent with the front desk for afternoon tea. If you don‚Äôt have time to eat on the 7th floor, you can pack it and take it back to your room~
Regarding the check-out time, Ctrip originally wrote 12 o'clock, but I didn't go out because of the bad weather. I went to the front desk to ask if I could delay the check-out time. The lady said that Ctrip users can delay until 2 o'clock. Like it ~ oh yes , When I checked out, the lady at the front desk gave me a box of coffee. Although the gift was small, it was very pleasant and caring~ (Shanghai is indeed a coffee city hahahaha)
This is my first time to stay in Huajiantang series of hotels, but the impression is very good. I didn‚Äôt encounter any bad things I saw when I was doing the strategy before, so although the weather is bad and the scenery is greatly reduced, this trip is still very good. happy~

Needless to say, the room facilities include smart toilets, mini bars, and a five-minute walk from the Bund of Yuyuan City God Temple. , in short, it is very convenient. It was raining heavily in Shanghai these two days. I took the children to read books and do homework in the hotel book bar. The young lady at the front desk also helped the children print out the test questions. Thank you very much. In short, the most satisfactory hotel for this trip, next time This time I bring my children to stay for a few more days

msg:The price/performance ratio of the hotel exceeded expectations. Before booking, I was confused about whether to choose a terrace room or a courtyard room. I was worried that the view from the courtyard would not be as good as that of the terrace. However, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe terrace is not as large as that of the courtyard, but the overall space is very good.

The hotel's mattresses and curtains are very good, and the family just planned to change the mattress. We didn't hesitate to lift the sheets the next day to check the mattress brand and mattress, and wanted to change to the same one.

The room service staff is also very considerate. Seeing that we have tea and tea sets, they put two or three more bottles of water in the room every day from the next day. During the five days and four nights of my stay, it rained almost all over the sea, and when I ordered takeaway, the robot delivered it quickly. The only fly in the oin**ent is that the bathroom is a bit far away, and it is a bit inconvenient to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night.

In general, Huajiantang and Yuyuan, a high-consumption place in Shanghai where every inch of land is expensive, scored 99 points.

The 30 square meters is not too big, but the equipment is complete, especially the soundproof earplugs. . The only point is that there is no magnifying glass installed on the sink, which is a bit unfriendly to the elderly, but everything else is satisfactory. I checked out early the next day, and I went back to the hotel early to pick up my luggage after finishing the work. I asked if there was an hourly room or paid half a day's room fee to take a rest at the hotel. The train in the afternoon was relatively late. The receptionist and the manager discussed it, and finally let us stay in the room that was canceled before, and gave us an extended check-out until two o'clock. This is to allow us to check in again when the room has been cleaned. This kind of service is very heartwarming, I give you a thumbs up üëç

The family room is relatively large, but unfortunately the factory roof is outside the window, so the terrace is useless. But the house price is so negligible, anyway, it is outside during the day. It is very close to Yu Garden, so it is worth taking a stroll carefully. Forget about the Town God's Temple, the snacks are seriously deceiving people... After the epidemic, even Shanghai's tourism is so crazy, it's really helpless. A small dish of tripe shreds, two-thirds of which is bean sprouts, the boat ticket is 135, but if you want to sit down, add 100...

There is a subway station when you go out, and it is also very close to the pier for night cruises on the Pearl River. The service is very thoughtful: the staff at the front desk took the initiative to remind us of the time for afternoon tea, and helped us book and pack in advance to avoid overtime. Lina Huang, who cleaned the room, was very enthusiastic. The child spilled a colored drink on the bed as soon as he entered the room, and immediately replaced it for free for us; There is also a stepping stool for children in the room. The manager is very humane. Our room only includes breakfast for two adults, and we also let two children eat for free (the sister who is 1.5 meters should buy a child's seat).

The only concierge on the first floor was a guy who sat aside and said nothing. The interior decoration follows the route of internet celebrity check-ins. It seems to have some design elements, but the quality is very cheap. The indoor floors, sofas and wall cabinets are all full of cheap feeling. Because it is an old building renovation project, the corridors are dark and narrow, the guest rooms are low, and the layout is awkward. Although the equipment is relatively new, the quality is very poor, and there are no big brand bathroom products. The service is basically not good. There is no turndown service. The front desk service guy speaks in a low and unclear voice. He obviously has not been trained in hotel service standards. There is no one to take the breakfast table. No one poured the coffee, no one put away the dishes in time. I don't understand how this facility, service and environment could be rated five diamonds.

The key is that it is super heart-warming, because I waited too long for the elevator and went up the stairs, and the service staff helped me carry my things. Everyone was smiling, the service was very good, and the breakfast was also very good, with many varieties and good taste. The indoor sanitation is also very clean, exactly the same as the publicity picture! Drinking coffee on the terrace in the morning is super comfortable~ You must stay here again next time you come to Shanghai!

I don't understand that as a high-end brand hotel, guests need to pay for their own vehicles. This somewhat subverts my perception of free parking in hotels... The reason why I gave a five-point review is because of the return visit attitude of the hotel's lobby manager It is still very good, very sincere, and I sincerely hope that the hotel will really pay attention to getting better and better. After all, it is not easy to run a store with a brand

It turned out to be a standard bedding. Every bed must have one. It looks like this has been going on for a long time. It shows how many loopholes there are in the management. Please choose carefully, travelers. I also hope that the hotel will improve as soon as possible.

On the same day, when I drove to the hotel entrance, there was a waiter who helped push the luggage, and there were staff who provided hot tea when waiting for check in in the lobby. The room is big enough, with smart toilet and bathroom separated, very spacious. The breakfast is very rich, complete with both Chinese and Western styles. After staying for three days, the dishes are different every day, and the taste is not bad. The only downside is that the elevator is too slow and the waiting time will be longer. Overall very satisfied.

msg:The location is very close to the Bund, and very close to Yu Garden. It is very convenient to bring the whole family to go shopping and eat. The family suite I booked this time is very worthwhile. It can be said that it is the best experience in a hotel in Shanghai. In addition to the large terrace garden that won the baby's heart, it also realized my idea of the best 10K route on the Bund in the morning. Parents are also very satisfied, the room is big, suitable for three big ones and one small one. What I like the most is the service of the hotel. You can drink freely in the water bar, welcome fruits, clean up in time every day, and because you know we have a baby, they will take the initiative to give us more drinking water. When I left, I gave you hanging ear coffee, and asked if I needed to bring extra water to drink on the road. The hardware and software are very comfortable. The only comment is that because I paid directly on Ctrip and did not pay the deposit, I would stare at me to pay the money when I had breakfast in the morning. I think the deposit can be paid normally, and the hotel consumption can be deducted directly, which will make the guests feel much more comfortable. The overall five-star recommendation is a service and feeling that has not been experienced in other hotels. There are also cute robots for food delivery, which makes the baby very happy. All in all very good!

msg:The overall experience of staying this time is good. First of all, the location of the hotel is good. You can see it when you get out of the subway station. It takes two or three minutes to walk. The hotel has a strong sense of design, and there are many art installations. From the 7th floor of the hotel lobby, you can see the "three-piece set" of the scenery outside the window. We booked a city double room. The room space is a bit small, and the space may be given up to the balcony and bathroom. The bathroom is relatively large and has a full-length mirror. There wasn't even a table in the room, so we just brought in the table from the balcony to put our stuff. The breakfast is average, and there are too many people in the elevator, so you have to wait for a while every time.

msg:Is this an unforgettable five-star luxury hotel? hotel.
1. Price: The parent-child room we booked costs 2,255 per night and only has 2 breakfasts. A parent-child room cannot be booked for 3 people. You must go to the hotel front desk to add money and buy another breakfast. The price is unmatched among similar luxury hotels.
2. Environment: Although the location is on the Bund, the scenery has nothing to do with the Bund. Apart from the elevator entrance, you can see several tall buildings. From the room, you can only see the roof of the bungalow next door. Is it just to allow guests to stand at the elevator entrance and enjoy the view?
2. Infrastructure: Speaking of elevators, during the whole day of our stay, one of the two elevators was always broken and the repair speed was extremely slow. This means that you have to go downstairs to get takeaways by yourself, and you have to wait for a long time every time you take the elevator. I don't understand why I have to come to a luxury hotel to experience the morning rush hour crowding in the elevator. Moreover, the lobby is on the 7th floor, so check-in and check-out have to be frantically fighting and waiting for the elevator.
3. Check-in experience: The breakfast restaurant seems to be a replica of the vegetable market. The difference is that the vegetable market is full of mothers cheering, but here is full of children running around. There are so few seats that we need to sit in the lobby to eat. I don‚Äôt know if the children are happy or not, but it‚Äôs obvious that I am not happy when I listen to all kinds of ‚Äúlaughter and laughter‚Äù one after another early in the morning and am afraid of bumping into the little cutie while carrying noodles.
4. Service: As a gold card trial member, although the benefits state that you can check out at 2 o'clock. Unfortunately, the hotel's rules are rules, and the rule is to check out at 1 o'clock.
Just staying here for one day already makes me want to be insulated. I have to say that if the main theme of this hotel is "hard work", then they must be successful.

The room service is also very attentive. The hotel is in a busy city. On the first day, I prepared earplugs because I was afraid of being noisy at night. On the second day, I prepared two extra bottles of water because of the hot weather. Because I had a baby, I also prepared a children's toiletry bag. The details are compared to ordinary hotels. A lot of care. The last thing is the location of the hotel. It takes four or five minutes to the Bund and you can take a sightseeing bus to explore the core area of ‚Äã‚ÄãShanghai. There is a subway entrance next to it, which is really convenient whether you are visiting or traveling.

msg:Let me talk about this Huajiantang
[Location] Super good. Adjacent to the Bund and Yu Garden, 10-15 minutes walking distance.
[Price] For a coat hotel, the price-performance ratio is relatively high. I have stayed in the river view room of the Linjiang Hotel on the Bund. The location is about the same, and the price is doubled. It's ok, save money to eat, eat, buy and buy.
[Room] The family room I booked is large, above 40 square meters, and the windows are small, but the room is well lit (I like bright rooms). Although the windows are small, they can also play a role in ventilation, which is enough. The room is very clean, with a 1.8 double bed + a 1.35 single bed, our family of three is very comfortable. The toilet is smart, the bath area, washing area, and toilet area are all independent and do not interfere with each other. There are long luggage racks and clothes hanging areas, I like this one so much! ! ! Beautiful mothers are blessed to have a makeup mirror, I don‚Äôt need it.
[Breakfast] Because I have children, I chose the price with breakfast. The breakfast is very good, the environmental dishes are good, the meal line is very long, and there are plenty of categories. There are noodles, rice noodles, spring rolls and omelettes made on site.
[Service] The check-in and check-out procedures are very fast, and they will pay attention to the needs of children. Watching us bring children, we offered children's toiletry kits (including children's toothbrushes and slippers).
[Shortcomings] We can only talk about shortcomings, not shortcomings. 1. Part of the design of the room lacks convenience. The kettle in the room is locked in a cabinet, but boiling water is a high-frequency demand. Every time you boil water, you have to open the cabinet. When making tea, the cabinet door will be opened. On the one hand, it is very troublesome to open the door every time to boil water. On the one hand, when the cabinet door is opened, the passage from the bed to the sofa is blocked, and the children are always afraid of knocking when they run around. 2. The waiter saw that we were bringing a baby and provided a baby wash bag. Little did they know that the baby still had some needs. I proposed to help the store make further progress. A baby under 1.3 meters needs a booster stool, otherwise it cannot be used in the washbasin. There is an effective wash, it is best to have a baby pillow, the hotel pillow is too high, if the baby is younger, such as 2-4 years old, you may need a children's toilet seat or a children's toilet, because the baby will fall off when sitting on the toilet Go on, no matter how young you are, you won't be able to get wet. My baby doesn't use a toilet seat, just by the way.
[Overall] Overall, I give a full score of 5 points, very good hardware facilities and software services, and hope to make further progress!

msg:The hotel lobby is on the seventh floor, and the first floor is a tall staircase. The doorman saw us coming and ran down quickly to help us carry our luggage. He greeted us politely every time we returned to the hotel or went out. The food delivery robot is also on the first floor. If you order food, the robot will deliver it to the door and ring the bell automatically, which is great.
The check-in speed is also very fast. We arrived at the hotel at 11:00 in the morning. We had to store our luggage first, but my little brother checked the available rooms and checked in early. Seeing that we had two children with us, he kindly gave it to us. Two sets of children's toiletries (toothpaste toothbrush and disposable shoes).
The Pearl Tower cannot be seen from the parent-child room of the hotel. You have to poke your head out from the small balcony of the room to see a little bit of the river on the Bund. Don‚Äôt expect too much from the outside scenery. But in the location close to the Bund, the hotel where you live can have a small balcony, where you can enjoy the breeze, drink tea or coffee (the hotel provides Sumida hanging ear coffee), and it is also a pleasure to be in a daze!
The dry and wet separation of the room is well done. The only downside is that the toilet is not ventilated enough and the smell is a bit strong. You have to take a bath every night when you come back. You can call the front desk to send a disposable bath bag (also sent by a robot). On the second day, Auntie, who is engaged in hygiene, knows that we have the habit of taking a bath, and also prepared disposable bags for us in advance, which is very considerate!
It takes only five or six minutes to walk from the hotel to the Bund. Downstairs are the Town God's Temple, Jiuqu Bridge and Yu Garden. You can eat all the way there. It is also close to the subway station. It takes seven or eight minutes to walk, so it is convenient to go everywhere!

The environment is elegant, the facilities are new, the design is novel, the room is large, the smart toilet, and the minibar is good. It is well received by the family! Originally, I wanted to stay for another two days, but due to the impact of the travel peak after the Spring Festival, the original room was booked! The hotel is better than many five-star hotels I have stayed in, whether it is the hardware or the service of the staff, they are very polite! The location is very close to the Bund and Yu Garden. It is convenient for eating and shopping. If you are tired from traveling, the children are willing to buy some snacks and go back to the hotel to eat and drink! I will stay again next time I have a chance, it is worth recommending! The room must be about 50 square meters, spacious and comfortable! The cleaning bar on the top of the building, we also went to spend, the scenery is good, the food and drink are not expensive, the owner is very nice, you can visit it without spending!

Because I brought my baby and the elderly together, I have always wanted to find a hotel that is comfortable and convenient to travel and has a good view. After reading a lot of guides, I finally settled on Huajiantang. I got a super five-star service that exceeded my expectations. Every service staff is very kind. , Goodnight Sweet Soup is self-service, but it will also take the initiative to help, serve the guests from the perspective of the guests, and the breakfast is delicious! After coming out so many times, I feel that Shaoxing Dayu Kwuntang and the breakfast here are super delicious hahaha~ Finally, I would like to thank Sun Chunlei at the front desk for his thoughtful service and actively helping to solve the inconvenience~
Traveling is really convenient. The Bund of Yuyuan Town God's Temple is very close. After all, with a three-year-old child, I have to hug and don't take a car. I am really grateful to be able to walk back to the scenic spot!

‚ë†The attitude of the staff is quite good, and the hotel is relatively new.
‚ë°The family room I live in has a relatively large space. Although it is arranged near the elevator, because the room is long and the bedroom is at the innermost, it is not affected, and the sound insulation is relatively good.
‚ë¢ Near the Bund, it is very convenient to go to the Yu Garden and go to the Bund.
In addition, talk about the areas that need improvement:
‚ë†The room is in the middle, and the windows cannot be opened. I arrived on the first night and found that the remote control of the air conditioner does not work at all, that is, the temperature is the same no matter what. The front desk told me that the central air conditioner cannot be adjusted. What is the function of the remote control? Later, people from the engineering depar**ent came and said that there was no way, the temperature was fixed, and we could only see if the master control could be adjusted the next day, so we asked the front desk to get an air-conditioning fan. As a result, the front desk said that they hadn't responded to the search, and then they called again and said that they had borrowed all of them. After a long time, they finally found a leafless fan. Is this setting a problem?
‚ë° On the night of check-in, we informed the front desk that the bathroom was not cleaned, and there were stickers of disposable items left by previous guests. Since the children were asleep, we said that it would be fine to clean it the next day. As a result, I stayed for 3 nights in a row, and the sticker was still there on the last night. Judging from the photos, the water stains are the same. It is hard not to think of other places from one detail.
‚ë¢In the room I stayed in, the zipper of the anti-theft lock was broken and the door could not be locked.
‚ë£ On the last day of check-out, the room card began to fail after 10 o'clock, and it became invalid at 11:30. Inform the front desk, the front desk said that the check-out at 12 o'clock today cannot be re-validated. The problem is that it expires before 12 o'clock, and the luggage has not been taken out, so how to get the luggage? The front desk said that was the rule.

Otherwise, The hotel manager was very calm and asked the front desk clerk to call me and said that he would use two breakfast coupons as compensation. Am I missing these two breakfasts from you?

The overall service is also very satisfactory.
During the stay, almost all of them were with children. It can be seen that the location is superior. After all, can we walk less?
Opposite the road is Yu Garden and Chenghuang Temple. It is also very close to the Yu Garden subway. Because there is free parking in the hotel, we parked the car directly in the ba*****t and took the subway. One stop to Nanjing Road and one stop to Lujiazui, which is very convenient.
Interesting fact: The first time I saw earplugs in a hotel, I was surprised. I wondered if it was because there was a bar on the top floor where we lived. The actual effect was fine, maybe it didn‚Äôt catch up with the busy time.
Noisy point, the biggest noisy point, the hotel only has two elevators as shown in the picture, and when I came here, I caught up with a big wave of travel. For me who is impatient, I really want to scold the street. The elevator is too slow and small. Go to the ba*****t It is also one of the two parts, which greatly reduces the favorable impression of staying, but fortunately, the room brings back the negative emotions.
Noisy point 2, the breakfast product is really sorry for the price of nearly 3,000, if the hotel's regular room rate is around 1,000, or more than 1,000, this breakfast is acceptable.
The last problem is that we were notified of a power outage the next day when we arrived. We were forced to check out early. The power went out at 10 o'clock. Why are you still in the room? ! Before leaving, I gave a gift, but the elevator and the power outage are really annoying.

msg:Years later, I wanted to go out for a walk, so I chose Shanghai, which is not far away, to stay for a few days to see the bustling night view of the Bund. On Ctrip, I saw Huajiantang. Yuyuan Hotel with a high score. The advantage lies in its geographical location, next to Yuyuan Garden and Chenghuang Temple. Not only is the transportation convenient, but it is also near the Bund, and it takes 5 minutes to walk across the road to the Bund. You can also see the night view of the Bund Jiangdong from the hotel, so I immediately booked a Bund viewing room. When checking in at the hotel, Sun Chunlei, the lobby manager, saw that we had booked a viewing room on the Bund on Ctrip, and helped us arrange a room with a great location for watching the night view of the Bund. After checking in, we were pleasantly surprised. Although the room is small, it has everything you need. The room facilities also reflect the exquisiteness and meticulousness of Shanghai. It is no worse than a five-star hotel. What excites us most is that the room has two large windows, one in the bedroom and one in the bedroom. One is located in the bathroom, facing the Huangpu River. Not only can the windows be opened to ventilate and enjoy the sun, but you can also see the brightly lit Jiangdong night view from the room. During the stay, it happened to coincide with the child's birthday. When we checked in, the manager Sun Chunlei ordered a birthday cake made by the hotel kitchen for us. It was delivered to the room on the day of the birthday. The child was very happy. He held the cake in the room and took a photo with the Oriental Pearl Tower. This Birthdays are memorable. There are too many warm services in the hotel for a few days, so I won‚Äôt repeat them one by one. Next time I come to Shanghai, I will choose Huajiantang. Yuyuan Hotel.

The high-end suites are more than 2,000 yuan. I am also worried that the surrounding environment in the central area is not good. When I arrived at the entrance, I was a little disappointed to see the lack of luxury hotel style at the entrance of a secondary road, but the hotel lobby on the seventh floor is a different scene. The lobby is spacious and bright, stylishly furnished, and the attitude of the service staff is also very good. The room is even more comfortable and spacious. Washing, bathroom, and toilet are separated. The room is equipped with a 2-meter bed and a 1.35-inch bed. The living room and bedroom each have a sofa and a TV. It is very comfortable for a family of three to live in, and it is especially suitable A family of four with a second child or three girlfriends live together. The refrigerator, drinks, fruit and snacks are also available for free, and the children like it very much. There are not many varieties of breakfast, but overall it is good. I usually don‚Äôt like to eat meat in the buffet breakfast. I didn‚Äôt expect to try the barbecue here. In addition, it is very close to the subway and the Bund. The two road platforms of the hotel are also very suitable for family and friends to gather and chat. All in all, it is right to choose this hotel when you come to Shanghai. Unfortunately, the time is too short, you check in too late, and you have to leave early in the morning.

msg:very angry
Give a real and big bad review. I am curious about how the good reviews come out.
First, I booked a Yuyuan Superior Room. I saw that it was marked as a closed window on Ctrip, but the door was actually a patio window where people could leave. I can imagine that if I didn‚Äôt know that I could leave, Change clothes and see everything at a glance!
Second, I am very dissatisfied with this room, and then the service staff told me to give me a solution, to change me to a room type, pay attention! It is a room type with external windows, the waiter said, this type of room with external windows is generally not open Open! This is obviously better than the patio window. Why does the hotel open the poor rooms to the guests, but keep the good rooms? Why keep them?
Third, I booked two rooms, because only one of the changed rooms has been cleaned, and the other one needs me to wait, why should I wait? Not satisfied with this solution, the female staff called a man The staff solved it for me. As a result, the proposal given by the male staff member was exactly the same as the one given before! Think of me as a fool!
Fourth, when I was dissatisfied with this room type at first, the staff didn't want to solve it, and replied slowly, asking me to contact Ctrip to change the room. Where is your service!?
The whole communication, looking at the house to change, delayed me for 30-40 minutes! The result was very angry and did not solve it! Stepping on the pit! Family trip

msg:Due to the epidemic and work reasons, there is no chance to travel in Shanghai now, so my husband and I found a hotel in Shanghai for a short stay on the weekend to relax. This time, we chose Huajiantang on the Bund to stay for one night. We chose a room with a courtyard, although It was a little rainy that day, but there is another mood in the rain. The minibar in the room can be enjoyed for free. The hotel lobby is on the 7th floor. The scenery outside the window is very good. You can see a three-piece suit. The photos taken are very impressive. I ordered takeaway at night and there was a robot to help deliver the food. It was very interesting. Yu Garden and the Bund were just outside the door. The location was very good. There was a bar on the top floor with a nice view. You can ask for a parking card at the front desk at b2. Parking is free. Before leaving I also gave hanging ear coffee as a gift, a very good stay experienceÔΩû

Talking about the restaurant, the part-time waiter is honest, the restaurant manager is unclear about his words and ideas, and the hotel manager is domineering and shirks his responsibilities.

msg:In this era of "Internet celebrity economy", anything with the word "Internet celebrity" can attract attention and become popular overnight. All walks of life want to get a piece of the pie, and the hotel industry is no exception. But "Internet celebrities" have always been opportunities and controversies. On the one hand, they can bring a blowout of traffic dividends, but if they fail to withstand the test of customers, it is very likely to cause polarization of word-of-mouth.

1. Static scene, create a good photo background for customers.
Hotel design has always been a headache for hotel managers. With limited budgets, the design must be distinctive and outstanding, which is almost impossible to accomplish. But to make a good Internet celebrity hotel and make consumers happy to share it, it is not all about spending a lot of money on decoration, but whether you have created a good "scene" for customers. Simple wall stickers, wooden decorations, corner tables and chairs, clever use of space, and design of hotel static scenes can create the most suitable background for customers to take photos and share. Of course, blindly pursuing scene decoration is not realistic for many hotels. With limited budgets and cramped space, the benefits of making good use of props and dolls come into play. Soft furnishings are standard for Internet celebrity hotels because they are low-cost and easy to replace, and can constantly create a sense of freshness for customers. At the same time, for hotels that often need to update the front desk lobby and marketing layout, timely adding doll props to attract photos according to marketing activities can also achieve good marketing and promotion effects.
2. Dynamic display, more hotel features
Compared with static photos, dynamic short videos can help hotels display more detailed services and products, and can also better bring customers into the consumption scene and form a strong cognition! **, Weibo is currently the main battlefield for hotel short video marketing. The hotel's characteristic guest rooms, static landscapes, and personalized services are packaged and displayed to cause mass communication. Careful netizens will find that many Internet celebrity hotels on the Internet actually use novel or unique props to arouse consumers' curiosity and desire to show, so as to achieve the purpose of marketing and promotion.
"Old things transformation" is a design that is highly sought after by homestays and characteristic hotels. The nostalgic style is not expensive, but it can cause a good communication effect. Some props can be purchased on Taobao, such as old farm tools, wooden decorations, old swings, summer cool beds, etc., which not only bring warm traces of life to consumers, but also become a popular background for many people to take photos and check in.
3. Interesting, satisfy consumers with one point to be remembered
You must have seen a lot of interesting marketing copywriting and posters. For consumers, hotels only need one point in the marketing process to cause communication and promotion. Brand marketing methods can be flexible and diverse. In addition to hard advertising posters, videos, live broadcasts, games and other forms can be borrowed. Wherever the target audience is, you go. But more importantly, show the hotel's own characteristic services to gain more recognition and curiosity from consumers.
4. Guidance, Internet celebrity hotels also need behind-the-scenes "promoters"
Consumer communication and promotion require more help from the hotel. Many hotels are just executing in the process of marketing and promotion. The lack of effective interaction with consumers also weakens the potential for secondary communication. In marketing and promotion, hotels should keep in mind the interaction and guidance with consumers. Interactive draws and sharing and forwarding are the most basic means of social marketing. Hotels can guide consumers to spread and promote through measures such as gifted prizes and services, enhance the marketing effect of hotels, and gain more exposure! 
"If you want to wear the crown, you must bear its weight." If you want to create an Internet celebrity hotel, in addition to grasping the consumer's consumption scenarios and psychological needs, and creating services and products that consumers are happy to share and show superiority, you must also focus on improving the hotel's software and hardware, otherwise the Internet celebrity halo will gradually fade, and you can only get short-term benefits and cannot go on in the long run. Never forget the service essence of the hotel, and don't forget your original intention to get it all the way!

msg:This is my second stay at Huajiantang. Before I came back this time, I missed the balcony, room view, toilet and bathtub of Huajiantang.

The first stay experience was very good. I felt the meticulous care and service during the National Day. This time, let me talk about the shortcomings of the second stay.

1. I always praise the ** brother who greets guests on the first floor. I remember that he enthusiastically helped to deliver meals, pull luggage and greet guests during the National Day. This time, there is only one of the two ** brothers left, and I can feel that it is a little deserted after the National Day.

2. The stay experience is not as good as the first time. From checking in to staying for a few days, the feeling is obviously not as good as during the National Day. This time the room is still on the 10th floor, but there is no Mini Bar to replenish it. The cleaning service did not do a new one every day. There was even one time when the aunt's towel fell in the room.

It can be said that Huajiantang is one of my favorite hotels in Shanghai. Every time I look forward to better service than the last time. The warm-hearted reception brother, the real smart toilet, and the leisure balcony are all the reasons why I chose Huajiantang.

msg:Step on mine! Whoever lives will regret it!
We booked 4 nights, the pit points are as follows:
1. The bathroom leaks, and the water overflows to the bathroom after taking a shower! After the report, the hotel did nothing TT (the photo was wiped by us, and there was still water overflowing)
2. The experience is poor. The umbrella with big mud is hung at the door for us to appreciate!
, It was only changed on the third day after reflecting the hotel, haha (Shanghai 1-3 is a sunny day, we have never used an umbrella).
3. The experience is poor, there is only one box of paper for the washstand, and the paper is thinner than the one bought by xx! Maybe we don't deserve it.
3. There is no service initiative. I asked for a nail clipper and made three urging calls. On the first day, I told the front desk to update the toothbrush every day, but I was still indifferent. I waited for our late call every night before delivering it.
4. False propaganda, such as night scenes and so on, are actually a corner of the Oriental Pearl Tower in the corridor. The door seems to be very tall, in fact.

Is there no advantage? Yes, parking is free (but at this price, there are hotels with free parking near the Bund in Shanghai~)

Anyway, we are not worthy, Jimeis judge for themselves ^_^

If you turn left, you will see the Bund Wanguo Building Complex, and if you turn right, you will see the Temple of the City God. The subway is also very convenient! It is also very close to the Huaihai Road and Nanjing West Road business districts by taxi. The location is really good! The price/performance ratio is also relatively high~ I will talk about other details~

#surroundings
The hotel is newly renovated, so the decoration style is fashionable and luxurious in line with the current aesthetic. The room is really a little small. Even if it is upgraded to the terrace room, I still feel that the room is very small, and I feel that the designer has done his best to make every place Used enough, no area wasted üòÇüòÇ

#breakfast
The breakfast at Huajiantang is very good~ The breakfast at this restaurant actually has Oden! It's amazing~ Xiaolongbao must be eaten, 2 per cage is just right, remember to dip it in vinegar!

#Serve
The hotel is equipped with a robot, which will deliver good night sweet soup to the room at night. When the robot arrives at the door, the phone will ring, and then you can see the robot when you open the door! In addition, a small take-out robot will also be delivered, but the take-out that cannot fit in the robot's stomach must be taken at the door on the 1st floor.

#health
The room we stayed in did not have much bugs, that is, the towels did not smell of detergent, and hotels that like to take a bath provide disposable bathtub covers.

#small easter egg:
First of all, I'm very happy. I checked in two weeks after my birthday. When I made the reservation, I asked the hotel if I could make up for my birthday. I didn't expect the hotel to really remember it! Not only did they upgrade me to the terrace room, but they also made arrangements, and also gave me a small cake~~ I was pleasantly surprised~~

Transportation: The location is in the city center, very close to the subway entrance to the Bund Yu Garden, it is convenient to go anywhere, and nucleic acid can be done across the road

Hygiene: very clean, the bathtub in the room is immaculately white, the breakfast plates and coffee cups are not only beautiful but also spotlessly clean, there is no scale, much better than other hotels of the same level

Environment: The whole is brass metal retro style, but it has a modern and fashionable artistic beauty. Not only are there many flower decorations, but also butterfly and flower specimens can be seen in the small book garden. The art works of Tianting are also unique. There is also a large viewing platform on the 11th floor, with a wide field of vision and excellent scenery. If there are more kinds of flowers, it will definitely be a beautiful sky garden.

Service: Very warm and attentive. Every employee I met, whether it was the security front desk room or the restaurant, was very warm and friendly, making me feel at home, and as soon as I entered the door, a waiter took the initiative to help me with my hand luggage and took it all the way. The front desk, this is very good and very proactive. The welcome at the door and the front desk will take the initiative to introduce the unique places of the hotel and guide me to visit, which is very considerate and helpful, otherwise I will definitely miss some scenery

For some other details, there is a special dressing table in the room, the TV is oversized, all kinds of drinks in the small refrigerator can be drunk for free, and there are also orange juice soda from the classic Shanghai brand Zhengguanghe, which is particularly praised! The quality of the welcome fruit presented is also good, washed very clean and fresh, which is completely different from some hotels that use dirty and rotten fruit to perfunctory

The aroma in the lobby is good and not too strong. Every night there are different seasonal sweet soups that can be tasted very warm. The hotel also has a cute robot that can deliver food to the room, which is very convenient and efficient.

The hotel's breakfast is also very rich. The dishes change every day, and you won't get tired of eating even if you live. What impressed me the most is their bread, many varieties are very delicious, especially the ones with strawberries and blueberries. One, I can eat several in one go, and the quality of the coffee and juice is also very high. Special praise, I am very satisfied with this foodie

Next time I have the opportunity to bring my parents and friends to stay, thank the hotel for leaving me with a good memory, this Huajiantang in Shanghai is really good

msg:Recently super like, satisfied with a hotel.
The location is superior, to the Bund and Yu Garden are within a few hundred meters walking distance. The design is strong and the details are well done.
The key point is to praise the service. There is not much space on the first floor, but it is actually just a guide desk. The waiter is super patient and carefully explains the nucleic acid code and other operations. The elevator goes to the lobby on the 7th floor, it suddenly opens up, the check-in speed is very fast, and it will specially call the room to remind the mini bar that the drinks are free.
The room I booked this time has a sun deck with a great view. The room has enough space for activities, the bathroom is separated from wet and dry, and the towels are fluffy and soft, which is very important!

The downstairs looks a bit messy, one is demolition in progress, and the other is due to historical reasons, and the surrounding stores downstairs are old and noisy. The service of the hotel is very good and the staff are very friendly. The biggest highlight is that the design of the front desk and restaurant on the seventh floor is very artistic, especially the breakfast restaurant is not inferior to some five-star breakfasts, not only the environment is good, but the quantity and quality of the dishes are good. The room I stayed in was a basic room type. The room was clean and tidy, with a square inch of space, and the furniture was carefully and reasonably arranged. The only flaw is that the area is too small, it is indeed too small, and it can only be barely maintained. If you look at the daily price of Ctrip, the price/performance ratio is actually not high.

After staying for two nights, the waiters are basically responsive and can quickly reflect and solve problems. The next day, I had dinner with friends at the hotel restaurant. The five-person set menu was also suitable for seven of us. There are no other service charges, and the waiter is also very active in serving, opening wine and pouring tea. Under the epidemic, I can't go to far places. I feel very happy in Shanghai to relax.

msg:1588's two-night courtyard package is very cost-effective. Xiyue, who has been living in Pudong before, also specially made a gold member of Huazhu, but to be honest, the group purchase package is much more cost-effective than the membership price.
Let's talk about the location of the hotel first: The location is very convenient. It is a five-minute walk from Exit 7 of Yuyuan Station on Line 14. The hotel is rented from Shanghai Tang Commercial Building, which is the floor above the 7th floor of the accessories market, so it is not a separate hotel. , and this building is very old, it gives the impression that Hanting is in an old commercial building, the lobby is also very low-key, but it still feels relatively low-key and delicate when you walk in
Room hardware: Because I live in a courtyard room, 50 square meters, the room is relatively narrow and long, and there is ample space. There is also a sofa TV. It is a Toshiba, and it has a 70-inch bar that can be projected. The toilet is automatic, separate from the bathroom, and there is a separate toilet in the toilet room. There are showers and bathtubs in the washbasin and the bathroom. The bathroom is from Kohler. The mattress is moderately hard and soft. , you can see the stars at night
Because it has just opened for a year or two, the hardware is very new and the standard is very high. Although it is not the international five-star luxury brand standard, it is considered luxurious.
For breakfast, there are a lot of Chinese-style xiaolong, hand-pulled cakes, tofu flower, and special donuts. There are porridge and noodles. If you like Chinese breakfast, you can come here.
The service is quite attentive. Everyone will greet you when you meet your needs. The takeaway will be delivered to the hotel by a robot. The only pity is, for example, what kind of courtesy does a gold member have? Enjoy the member check-out time. Later, when I said check-in, it said that I could delay check-out until two o'clock, which means it's already embarrassing them.
At this point, it is comparable to the international five-star. A two-hour delay will not affect the hotel's revenue, and it is a Sunday check-out. I believe it is not because there are guests who need to check in, but this is what they ordered. the rules
Xiyue and Huajiantang are both high-end brands of Huazhu. In terms of hardware and decoration, I think they are on par with luxury hotels, and the style has the unique style of Chinese hotels, but some MLM-style membership cards are really styled. It's not that you can't afford more than 200 gold members, but you don't experience the services of gold members after you do it, and if everyone does it, how can you get the services of members and non-members? Of course, if you order from the official channel, you will get breakfast, but if the official channel of the goose does not have the cheap agent channel, why bother?
In short, I am very satisfied with the hardware and service of the courtyard room for two nights in 1588. The location is also very convenient. If the original price of 1588 for one night is persuaded to quit, add a few hundred and two thousand to go to the hotel on the Bund, and I think the cheapest room type It is only 23 square meters and has no windows. It costs more than 800. Rounding it up is the advanced version of Hanting, which is not necessary.

Cleanliness can only be given 7 points. Because of work habits, when entering the hotel, the overall cleanliness of the room will be checked. There is a hair on the sink, and the bottom ring of the toilet seat has not been wiped clean.
It is a hotel worth recommending. I hope that the cleaning will be more meticulous next time. Matches the quality of the rest.

When I checked in, the concierge gave me warm Pu'er tea, welcome fruit in the room, and free drinks in the minibar , The do-not-disturb earplugs provided at the head of the bed show the hotel's meticulous care for guests everywhere. What surprised me even more is that standing on the large terrace full of sage, I can overlook the unique scenery of Shanghai. The breakfast is also unique. My favorite is the Shanghai-style eight-treasure rice, as well as freshly squeezed fruit and vegetable juices. The head chef Ling Tao asked every guest for advice on the spot...
Huajiantang ¬∑ Yuyuan is close to the Bund, Yu Garden, and the commercial center. It is the best choice for business and tourism.

msg:Overall, I am satisfied with the room. The location is good. The main entrance is in the alley, behind the Bund Soho. It is very convenient to go to the Bund. The hotel is across the road from the nucleic acid testing point. Balcony rooms are friendly to smokers

Service: The doorman's service is very good, and the robot delivery is also good, but the service staff at the front desk are really speechless, and I really don't understand the membership card system of Huazhu members. I recommend you to apply for a card when you check in , Gold card members only have breakfast, but if you are not a gold card, you have to spend money to apply for the card. It is said that booking a room on the Huazhu app is more favorable, but the room booked on the Huazhu app does not include breakfast? ? Do I still have to pay for breakfast? Breakfast is free at 99 yuan if you apply for a card, and 149 yuan if you don‚Äôt apply for a card. But let alone 149 yuan for your breakfast, 99 yuan is not worth it. It‚Äôs very strange, recommending members to you in a serious manner, so that our co-residents didn‚Äôt eat and left. I spent more than 10,000 on the room for 6 consecutive days. It‚Äôs definitely not bad for your 99 or 149 for breakfast. This kind of Marketing is really annoying, why not have a membership price quietly.

But the bedding was poor, especially the pillows, which looked very spacious, and fell into it as soon as I fell asleep, and the bed was uneven, making it difficult to sleep. Good night sweet soup, I have to go to the reception hall to drink it myself. Children's breakfast is payable upon check-in. Having lived in many Huajiantangs across the country, this one is a poor experience.

msg:Summary: mid-to-high-end brand, facilities are ok, service is very general. I think the price/performance ratio is a bit low.
Highlights: Fully automatic toilet, oversized TV with screen projection, minibar enjoyment
Disadvantages: small room, no desk and chair, average service, average cost performance

The location of the hotel is average, on the Bund, but it is not a place with very convenient transportation. The lobby is on the 7th floor, it's pretty nice. The overall feel of the building is relatively mid-range, similar to Atour's. However, in terms of room facilities, the hotel has worked hard on what our consumers can experience. For example, the toilet is fully automatic, the minibar can be enjoyed at will, there are welcome fruits (two ugly oranges), and the TV can be projected on a large screen... Through these, the overall accommodation experience is improved.

The hotel has robots that can deliver couriers and takeaways to the room, which is a good feeling. However, the hotel room is relatively small, there is no desk, and the living area has only a bedside table in addition to the bed, and the overall accommodation space is relatively small. It may be because Huajiantang was originally a resort brand, and it is not very friendly to business travelers.

The service was not very ok. I brought a cake for my friend's birthday and asked the front desk if there was a lighter or a match to borrow. The waiter didn't even ask if it was a birthday and said happy birthday. This really does not work.

The Chris**as a**osphere is getting stronger. The lobby is on the 7th floor. At my request, the front desk upgraded the family room, which provides a spacious environment for the other two "aunties" to come and have a deep chat after get off work.
Huajiantang is just as its name suggests. The decoration, furnishings and layout of the room are simple and elegant, and the contrasting colors of red and green have a unique charm. Toiletries, Minibar gifts, and even bedding are all reminiscent of childhood. I slept well at night. It was a rare day when I didn‚Äôt have to take care of the baby and think about work, but we seemed to have forgotten to turn on the air conditioner...
The afternoon before, I went shopping in Yuyuan Garden, which is a ten-minute walk away. I tasted fresh meat dumplings, ginger tea, local and Changsha stinky tofu. In the evening, I ordered Cantonese food at Tianbi Gao on Soho Bund B1 opposite the hotel. It was a little expensive, and The space is limited, but fortunately the taste is pretty good. After a full meal, you must digest it. It only takes fifteen minutes to walk to the Puxi Riverside Observation Deck on the Bund. I strolled with my friends and talked and laughed in the river breeze. I don‚Äôt know when the next time will be. I walked back to the hotel and ordered takeout. The robot helped deliver it to the room, which was very convenient. After drinking for a few times, I didn‚Äôt disperse until late at night to rest.
The hotel is only a ten-minute walk from Yuyuan Road Station of Metro Line 10, so traveling in all directions is very convenient.
The breakfast buffet on the second day was rich in variety, combining Chinese and Western styles. When breakfast was about to close at ten o'clock, the waiter reminded us three times to pick up food.
Although I only stayed for one night, my impression was very good and it is worth recommending!

msg:As a domestic hotel brand, Huazhu has grown quite well, and Huajiantang has a different flavor compared with the Xiyue that I have stayed in before.
The hotel‚Äôs facilities are very comfortable to use, from the automatic flip-top washlet to the large-size LCD TV that can be screened, it can bring a very good experience. This time I didn‚Äôt experience the breakfast at his house (the location is so good, it‚Äôs right next to the Yu Garden, all inclusive of eating, drinking, and fun). Maybe you can only make a good meal if you create something of your own, but this is not a disadvantage. .
The only shortcoming, please refer to Figure 9. On the terrace ground, there are cigarette butts thrown on the ground by the guests in the previous round. The sanitary condition really needs to be improved.

Then this family room has no windows and is very stuffy. I thought about turning on the air conditioner, but I was told The air conditioner in the room is just a decoration, it cannot be turned on, it is controlled by the central air conditioner, and there is no way to adjust the temperature. Then the child spent a night in the sauna, changed into two pajamas, and his hair was soaked!
Suggestion for everyone: Stay in a hotel or stay in an old-fashioned hotel. No matter what the facilities and services are, they are all excellent. Internet celebrity hotels are all gimmicks!

The room is a small suite. The dressing table that is visible as soon as we enter the door wins our hearts. On the left is the bathroom separated from wet and dry, and on the right is the bedroom with a terrace. The interior is quiet and soundproofing is good. The air conditioner won't blow, and it feels very good to sit and chat on the terrace with free drinks from the small refrigerator at night.
I will come again next time I have a chance.

Exchange tickets at the service center, and then go to board the boat for a night cruise on the Pujiang River. The hotel is also very close to Yu Garden and Chenghuang Temple. It is nearby and you can walk past it. It is also very convenient to take a taxi to Nanjing Road and Shanghai Central Tourist Office. In short, I was very satisfied after staying for two days. Keep working hard, the price is more favorable, and it would be better to provide breakfast for the third person.

I asked the hotel attendant to bring toilet water and put on half-length trousers to sleep. I was bitten by more than 5 a.m. Itching wakes up. The whole calf was bitten again. I wanted to hold the quilt to be tested by a third-party testing agency. Later, the police were called and the Consumers Association was called, but the matter has not been resolved. Now the condition is getting more and more serious, because the buttocks have also been bitten, it is uncomfortable to sit down, can only lie down and stand. The doctor said that he was not sure what kind of bug it was. Fleas and mites are more likely. The hotel said it would be based, where did they follow up? The room fee will be refunded to me. However, this matter is not only the check-out fee, the sanitary condition of the hotel can be so bad, it will change like this after one night's sleep? Don‚Äôt you change the quilt without getting rid of the mites?

msg:First of all, I am very honored and thankful that the hotel has upgraded the room type. The actual room type I stayed in this time is the Deluxe Big Bed Room with panoramic view of the Bund. Therefore, the guest room part of this review is only for this room type. The hotel is located between Renmin Road and Yong'an Road, and you can reach Yu Garden through one street. The surrounding traffic is very convenient, and it only takes a few minutes to walk from the subway station. The lobby on the first floor is the concierge lobby of the hotel, and the reception lobby is located on the 7th floor. There are two elevators in the hotel. This is also the place where the check-in experience is not very good. Because the hotel has a large amount of rooms and high occupancy rates, it is difficult to wait for the elevators during peak periods, and there seems to be no air conditioning system in the elevators. When the flow of people is concentrated, it will be boring in the elevator. The design and decoration of the hotel rooms are based on the flowers of the Huajiantang brand, creating an a**osphere where you can feel the natural a**osphere in the city. The washroom and the toilet in the room are separated separately. The washbasin and shower room are isolated separately in the washroom. The shower room is equipped with a bathtub, and you can also see the beautiful scenery of the Bund. The bathrobes provided by the hotel are a bit out of season in this season. The bathrobes are thicker and should be comfortable to wear in winter and very skin-friendly. A variety of drinks and a small snack are provided in the minibar for free. When you enter the bedroom area, the first thing you see is the panoramic floor-to-ceiling windows and the super-sized TV (the specific size is not asked by the hotel partner, and the visual inspection is definitely not less than 60 inches). The TV supports projection screen. Do you like to use the big screen to follow the drama or I like the gospel of my friends watching the game on the big screen. The bed is a 2-meter-wide extra-large bed, so you don‚Äôt have to worry about grabbing a position with the TA. You can turn over whenever you want. The guest room adopts an intelligent guest control system. There is no need to insert a card to get electricity like in a traditional hotel. The room card is just a card to control the elevator and open the door. There are a set of intelligent guest control switches on the left and right bedsides. The key to turn on and off the lights of the whole house, as well as the lights set according to the needs of different scenes, can be operated here. By the way, screens and curtains are also operated through this guest control system. Let‚Äôs talk about the hotel‚Äôs breakfast. The breakfast time is very long, and the breakfast categories are relatively rich, including pasta, Chinese and Western. There is no need to worry about the lack of location for dining in the restaurant. The hotel also has a very considerate service, smart robots. When we are inconvenient, the hotel‚Äôs smart robots can deliver what we need to the room. The above is the experience of staying this time. If it is helpful to your choice, please give me a thumbs up~

msg:The price-performance ratio of the suite is too low. The so-called window is just a small window surrounded by reinforced concrete. Once the curtains are opened, there is no privacy.
The lights in the bedroom and the lights in the living room are on the same switch, so if someone wants to turn off the lights to sleep, people in the living room will have to chat in the dark, which is a perfect design.
The free fruits were delivered in the middle of the night after three reminders. I don‚Äôt insist on these fruits, I just ask you to do what you say.
There are no toiletries. If you need them, ask them for them.
You can enjoy a bartender for free once. I forgot to save the message. I went to the front desk and asked them if they informed me. Later, when I checked out and returned, I found in the message that it was indeed a gift. The hotel was so dishonest.
Not recommended anyway! ! !
