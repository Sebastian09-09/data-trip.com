msg:The intercontinental hotel in Hangzhou  is a magnificent piece of architecture. It is structured like a giant sphere, and once you get inside, there‚Äôs a massive space in the middle where you can look up and see all the floors above, and it‚Äôs really something to behold. I found the staff to be very nice and friendly, and Ella at the front desk (who is a young woman) was friendly to me and helped me out - so just to give her a rap. The hotel is also not too far from a kind of underground shopping centre below a very nice park, which is beside the hotel. You can also walk down to raffles city, which is another nice shopping centre about five minutes walk across the other side of the park. All ip I found my stay here very  nice. I‚Äôd highly recommend the hotel to others.

msg:Everything was smooth until the check-out happened. I was scared because I need to pay something for ordering food. I explained that we did not order anything and that we had dinner outside the hotel. They tried calling the hotel restaurant to confirm and they said that it for for burger and beer and that it was ordered around 10pm. I told them that we were outside during that time. They let me wait for over 20 minutes and they still couldn‚Äôt figure it out. I know it is not the fault of the front-desk staff. I need to catch a train and didn‚Äôt know what to do. I said I will just pay it but I asked them to check it further, maybe the CCTV, the money was refunded eventually but no one informed about what actually happened. It is scary to not really know what happened. Did someone actually ordered using our room number? Or was it a technical mistake? Not sure. I would probably stay again in this hotel but I will inform the front-desk staff to not allow anyone order a room service.

The staff were kind and welcoming, surprising me with a room upgrade, bottle of red wine and beautiful tea set as a gift because they knew it was my last night! Room was large and clean, albeit the furniture is a bit dated - but the service makes up for this. A beautiful big bath (with a TV) and powerful shower. The bathroom was so big it felt a bit of a maze! Excellent selection of English TV and on demands films available, and a great room service menu - including vegan dishes - which is very rare in China! Staff speak English very well, and I hope when the Asian Games happen later in the year that this is the hotel of choice for foreign guests! A special mention to Benjamin and Mandy who helped check me in - they were fantastic!

msg:InterContinental is my favorite hotel! The location is convenient, you are at a walking distance from big malls like Raffles City and MixC. Also walking from the hotel you can enjoy the wonderful view of the river and the outline of the city and beautiful skyscrapers on the other side. The service is good but I was intrigued about the criteria used at the entrance of the hotel regarding who is chosen by the employee to receive assistance getting luggage out of the car or even opening the car doors. I guess if you get to the hotel riding a Didi or taxi you‚Äôre not qualified to receive the service? Cause I saw someone arriving in a nice car and the guy made sure to open the car the door while my Didi arrived right after and he didn‚Äôt move while I put the luggage on the trunk of the car on my own. Please, don‚Äôt get me wrong. I don‚Äôt mind doing it and have the ability of doing so, I was just curious observing that there is a distinction about who receives the service or not at this hotel specifically. Nevertheless, the accommodations are clean, spacious and comfortable. In general, the staff is very friendly and make sure you have a nice experience.

Service with a smile. Lovely breakfast.
My first time in an executive room with access to the executive suite which provides afternoon tea until 5pm and then a small buffet and alcohol.

The hotel was decorated lovely for Christmas and helped get me in the festive mood. 

This was my second time staying at the hotel and I will be back despite two problems:
1) our room had two single beds despite me booking a king bad room.
2) I was asked to wear a mask in the gym which I understand but the heating in the gym was set to 26.5 which was far too hot to complete exercise especially while wearing a mask.

msg:The 'Golden Globe' as it is called, is a wonderful experience to stay in. The size of the hotel is vast with all the rooms facing outwards towards the city or the river, both with beautiful views. We were greeted, in English, at reception and had a swift check in. The inside of the hotel is fabulous with the restaurant and cafe in the main reception area - both a very relaxing experience. You can sit and have a coffee overlooking the Hangzhou Grand Theatre. You can access the rooms via the 5 lifts provided. The rooms are very spacious and equipped with everything you need whether it be a one night stay, or one week stay. The staff are incredibly friendly and efficient. The hotel is also equipped with a swimming pool (on the top floor) and fitness gym. I would highly recommend staying at the Intercontinental Hangzhou. The hotel and rooms are beautiful, and although pricey, well worth a stay. Benjamin, an employee at the hotel, even checked in with us after our stay to hear of our experience and to provide feedback. We felt incredibly well looked after.

msg:This trip was a birthday surprise. The hotel is like a ‚Äúmust experience‚Äù here in Hangzhou. The architecture is incredible. I read many reviews before solidifying my decision to choose this hotel. I have stayed at cheaper hotels which provided way more where the rooms are concerned. The place was very quiet upon arrival. Upon entry it is very beautiful and has a wonderful perfume like smell. However, when you get to the floors for the room the carpets are very dirty, including the carpets in the room. I think this hotel is too pricey for the upkeep to be so poor. Customer service was just normal. People stated how they went all above and beyond but I got no such experience. 

The food at the sun and moon restaurant  for lunch was pricey and bland, I do not recommend. We had the Hangzhou fried rice, worse fried rice ever. The breakfast buffet, everything was cold, very little western food choices (although stated in the breakfast details) apart from the very tiny waffles and green tea pancakes and well cereal. 

Before arrival customer service told me that they would arrange for a little birthday surprise by the hotel which would include a small cake and happy birthday balloon decorations. We got the decorations but no small cake. But the thought was appreciated. 
The bed, omg soooo comfortable. The bathroom very beautiful love the layout and the bathtub was by far the best. Overall, the room was great, but the flooring has got to change.

msg:I had a great stay at the Intercontinental Hangzhou. I made a last minute booking but everything went well. 

The staff at the reception ushered me to a desk with an English-speaking staff so checking-in was a breeze. They found out that it was my birthday and they gave me a complimentary cake and card and made sure I get a room with a good view. That was such a nice gesture. 

The room was spacious, clean and comfortable. It was also quiet so it was definitely a relaxing stay. The room also had an amazing night view of Qiantang River.

The staff in the restaurant, the gym and the pool were all very nice and helpful. A staff called me after checkout to get my feedback regarding my stay. They have excellent customer service in my opinion.

I‚Äôll definitely stay here again. üòä

They moved me to a different room when I pointed out some of the issues however that room still had problems just not as bad. The buffet had some good things and lots of seafood (if you like seafood) however the breakfast danishes were more like a bread then danish, some of the food was cold and bland and there were many mistakes in the labeling of the food. The roast lamb and ham was the best part of the buffet. Room service quality was better then the buffet. The staff tried to fix the problems but there were just too many for them to fix.

msg:I stayed at the InterContinental Hotel in the landmark building "Golden Globe" in Hangzhou again, and the stay experience was as good as always. The appearance is unique, and the golden dome in the "Golden Globe" is dreamy and magnificent. The check-in speed in the lobby on the 5th floor is fast, the service is good, polite and warm. It gives people a warm first impression. The handsome and beautiful waiters who guided the stairs were proactive, diligent and polite. The rooms are spacious and stylish, and the layout is modern and elegant. The king-size bed is super large, and the bedding is soft and comfortable. The walk-in closet is great. Although it is on the 14th floor, the shower in the bathroom has a strong flow. The hotel breakfast is very rich, and the empty plates are cleared quickly. The beautiful waiters at the front desk of the buffet restaurant on the 5th floor are all very nice, with high quality and good service. Greeting, seat, meticulous and thoughtful. Special praise and thanks to the beautiful girl Xiao Pang. During my stay at the hotel, I ordered 11 lunch sets at the buffet restaurant on the 5th floor. My classmates who came from other places specially took the high school class teacher who settled in Hangzhou 50 years ago and is now nearly 90 years old to the hotel for lunch and reminiscing about the friendship between teachers and students. That night, we ordered 13 buffet dinners to have dinner and reminisce with classmates who studied in Hangzhou more than 40 years ago. Because there were a lot of people dining both times, we needed to order in advance and choose seats and share tables. The beautiful lady Xiao Pang called us many times in advance and was very patient and polite to inform us of the relevant information, trying to meet our requirements and satisfy us. The seating arrangement was very appropriate and reasonable, and the view was also very good. The teachers and classmates all praised the beautiful dining environment, warm service and good taste of the dishes of the InterContinental Hotel. As the inviter and arranger, I was very happy to hear this and felt very proud. Here I give a thumbs up to the beautiful lady Xiao Pang! A big thumbs up! The lobby bar is also great, the chrysanthemum tea is of good quality, and the waiter is very timely and diligent in refilling water. Thank you again! I will come to Hangzhou again during the National Day holiday, and I will still choose the InterContinental Hotel. I have already placed an order for a few days of rooms. I highly recommend the InterContinental Hotel in the "Big Golden Ball" when I come to Hangzhou!

It's just one stop away from the Olympic Sports Center on Subway Line 7. The doorman on the first floor is very enthusiastic. He takes the initiative to pick up luggage and looks at guests instead of treating them like nothing. This is worthy of praise.  The hotel is close to the subway entrance (N2), which is convenient for travel. The first floor below is directly connected to the outlets, which is very convenient. The only shortcoming of this trip was that the sink was blocked, and it was blocked by a nasty condom. I immediately asked housekeeping to take care of it. I can only say that the quality of the guests was too poor, and the used condom actually came close to the sink.

It is very warm and thoughtful. Because it is a diamond room, the upgraded river view room is particularly powerful.

This pearl standing on the bank of Qiantang River is a harbor specially built for dreamers. It is adjacent to the city balcony. You can immerse yourself in the fascinating city light show in a ten-minute walk. Downstairs is the shopping paradise outlet, which is full of dazzling goods to satisfy every desire for fashion.
Entering the hotel, the rhythm of art hits you in the face. Every design reveals extraordinary ingenuity, as if you have walked into a mobile art gallery. The smile and enthusiasm of the front desk, like a long-lost friend, instantly warmed the tired heart of the traveler. What is even more touching is that the front desk lady thoughtfully gave the accompanying children a soft and cute plush bear. It is not only a gift, but also the beginning of a warm memory of this journey.
At dawn, the hotel's breakfast restaurant turned into a paradise for taste buds. The combination of Chinese and Western delicacies is dazzling, satisfying the taste buds and injecting full vitality into the new day. When night falls, push open the French window in the room, the night view outside the window is like a breathtaking painting slowly unfolding, the stars and lights complement each other, beautiful and intoxicating, at that moment, time seems to stand still, all the fatigue and troubles are gone with the wind.
Every moment in InterContinental Hotel Hangzhou is a deep interpretation of the beauty of life.
Disadvantages: Carpet hygiene should be improved a little; it would be better to add a washing and drying system in the cloakroom (the mirrors in the washroom have their own heating function, and the cloakroom should also be able to do it).

msg:I gave this hotel a full score, more because of my trust in the InterContinental brand. As an old hotel, it has now become a landmark in Hangzhou. I believe its quality will continue to improve. However, I would like to say something that I think can be improved. One is the management of the swimming pool. It is understandable that the swimming pool of this hotel is quite good, the water temperature is relatively high, it is very friendly to children, and it is located on the top floor of the hotel with a wide view, which is a good choice for leisure and sports. However, the lifeguards in this swimming pool are not well matched. I don‚Äôt know if there should be a mandatory regulation for this? When I went there on the first night, the lifeguards wore headphones and held their mobile phones in their hands. I understand that they were playing games and did not take care of whether the children in the swimming pool were in danger. I went there again the next morning, and there was no lifeguard at all. The water in this swimming pool is not shallow. I feel that it is 160. Many children can‚Äôt reach the bottom with their feet, which is still a safety hazard. The second is the breakfast problem. The food is not replenished in time, and the juice is not replenished in time. I remember that InterContinental has requirements for this, but it is obviously not implemented here. There were not enough waiters. When I entered, a waitress asked me if I needed a drink. I said I wanted a cup of coffee. Then I waited until I finished eating but no one brought it to me. I think it was probably forgotten. There is another thing I want to verify, that is, should the salted duck eggs in the buffet be cut up? This is the first time I have seen whole salted duck eggs in a hotel buffet, placed there in a bowl. I was thinking, do you think foreigners know that this thing should be eaten by picking it up? Hehe

I originally planned to stay for a day to experience a different homestay, but it was so comfortable that I added another day.
The only regret is that every time at breakfast, the little girl at the front desk had to loudly confirm the room number and whether to have breakfast, which was a bad experience! Since the room card was swiped, shouldn‚Äôt you immediately determine all the information internally? Revealing customer privacy like this should not be the service of a five-star hotel!

msg:The hotel is in a great location, right in the Civic Center! Traveling with children, the little ones like the Golden Ball very much, and they are clamoring to stay for a long time. There is a subway entrance downstairs, and it is also very convenient to travel. The overall architecture of the hotel is very distinctive, with a strong sense of design, especially the sightseeing elevator in the ball. The children like the rich variety of restaurants. The hotel is doing very well. Ella at the front desk was very enthusiastic to help us upgrade the room when checking in. It faces the Qiantang River view, and you can join InterContinental members for free and get a discount. Thank you Ella for sending welcome drinks. The children had a lot of fun. Manager Yao sent children's toiletries to the room. After leaving the hotel, I met Jennifer and sent the children a commemorative bear with InterContinental significance. The children were so happy! InterContinental's service is as good as ever, trustworthy, and an old customer of InterContinental. Thanks again to Ella and Jennifer for their thoughtful service! It put a perfect end to this trip! A pleasant surprise. Hygiene: üëç Facilities: üëç Environment: üëç Service: Great, great, great üëç

msg:The hotel is good overall. Although it is a bit old, it is well maintained. Most of the hotel staff are very enthusiastic and supportive! From the receptionist to the restaurant staff, my family and I felt welcome... Polly at the front desk helped us arrange the check-in. In the IHG member area, her service was OK. Although not very enthusiastic, she was not indifferent. What was offensive was the female colleague next to her. Not only did she interrupt our conversation, but she also told us in a blunt manner that she could not determine whether the child had free breakfast or half-price breakfast. She had to go to the restaurant to measure her height to find out. She kept emphasizing that the front desk did not have this authority and it was the restaurant's business... Such an attitude and reason made people speechless, very unprofessional and unprofessional! The image is not consistent with InterContinental! The question is who asked you, who are you? The director of the front office depar**ent needs to coach this employee well, otherwise the hotel will get a bad review because of such an employee! Finally, I would like to thank CSM Lisa for her patience, attentiveness and professionalism. She listened to my story and calmed me down. She helped me arrange the room type listed on the IHG website and sent me red wine. She also came out to say farewell to me and gave me a small gift during the C/O. Thanks again to Lisa for making our trip to Hangzhou a complete success!

You can take subway line 7 to Wujiang Square to change buses to the West Lake. The swimming pool is very good. The kids played in it for a long time. Free foam boards and lifebuoys are also provided. Great. The breakfast is rich. The package we ordered also includes a romantic dinner for two. It's delicious. There are many varieties. But steaks, oysters, king crab legs, etc. will be taken away quickly and not added in time. Another disadvantage is that the toilet in the room smells like urine, which means that it is not cleaned thoroughly. As a five-star hotel, it needs improvement.

You have an unobstructed view of the Qiantang River, with the Hangzhou Grand Theater and City Balcony on the side, and the Olympic Sports Center (Big Lotus) on the opposite side. The hotel service was very friendly, and they also helped upgrade the room type and provided souvenirs.
Parking is extremely convenient and you can enter and exit the parking lot at any time within two days. There is also a subway station downstairs. Those who don‚Äôt drive can also choose the subway to travel, which is convenient.
The food is consistent with the intercontinental tradition, combining local characteristics to produce delicious food, while providing a variety of choices for foreign customers.
The only complaint: I hope Kangqiao Lobby Bar can improve its coffee skills. Of course, it does not focus on coffee, it is not its main business. (If you mind, just order a drink)
Like other continents, there are many foreign friends to choose from. If you are lucky, you can seize the opportunity and contact Spoken Language~^_^

msg:I have stayed at InterContinental Hotels in other cities before, and I am a member of InterContinental. I trust this brand quite a lot. This time I came to Hangzhou to stay at the Grand Golden Ball, and I was more than satisfied with it. First, the customer service called the hotel one day in advance to ask about the arrival time and what was special about it. Yes, by the time we arrived at the front desk to go through the formalities, the guest rooms had already been arranged and all special needs had been fulfilled. Check-in was very efficient. Second, every staff member I met in every position was very dedicated, smiling and proactively providing help with enthusiasm, which is rare in other international hotels. Third, the quality and service of the breakfast exceeded expectations. The variety is very rich, well-made and fresh. For example, porridge, soup, and coffee should be hot enough, and the chilled Western meat dishes should be cold. The service staff said "What else do you need?" "Hello me" sounds really comfortable, and I feel a sense of trust. Special praise to the front desk guy (I took his business card) for being gentle and friendly, efficient in checking in, and very serious and professional when applying for a new room card. In addition, the location of the hotel is great, the hardware facilities are well maintained, the room is large enough, the bed is huge, and there is an underground parking lot. I will stay here again next time. I highly recommend this hotel.

Spring Takeaway Afternoon Tea: This rip-off package directly throws two takeaway boxes and takeaway cups to you. The parking garage is very old and dim. The hair dryer feels so old that it feels like it was produced more than ten years ago. It is seriously rusted and paint-chipped. It cannot be used. The double bed is 120 instead of 135 and is very small. The highlight is that the washing and care products are Byredo, which is awesome! The breakfast is average.

You need to go to the 5th floor to check in. The front desk service is pretty good. The check-in procedure is quick and proficient. The whole process is very smooth. Politeness, other staff in the hotel were just average, and they didn't say hello when they met, which is not like Intercontinental's service standards.
Hygiene: The room is in good hygiene condition, quite clean, and there are no stains on the sofa.
The hotel is relatively old and the rooms are a bit old, but fortunately they are clean and acceptable. The rooms are large and comfortable. Even the bathrobes are very old and obviously very old.
Let‚Äôs talk about the breakfast. It‚Äôs really not good. It has no special features, few varieties, and the taste is very average. Not to mention the service. After eating breakfast for two days, it can be said that there is no service. This is the worst breakfast I have stayed at in so many Intercontinental hotels in China. No, the breakfast restaurant with the worst service?

Secondly, some people commented that the facilities need to be improved. The room I stayed in was generally good and the hygiene was OK. The disadvantages were that the curtains were broken and the tea products were not added. I can accept these. Disadvantages: The service needs to be improved. 1. It was 7pm when I first arrived at the hotel. After getting off the taxi, there was a service staff at the door of the hotel just one meter away from the taxi. He crossed his hands in front of me and looked at me carrying my bag. I took my things and my children and then went to the trunk to drag out the heavy luggage. I just watched and didn't come to help, let alone ask if I needed help. I really didn't have any hands. Thank you for closing the door for me. Someone helped me put my luggage when I left the hotel, but the first impression was already bad. 2. When checking in, I communicated with the children, one large and one small, and prepared children's toiletries in advance, but they still didn't have them when we arrived in the room. 3. Check-in: The front desk staff was relatively indifferent and did not answer any questions. I booked a superior king-size bed on the first two days and a luxurious river view on the third day. Since it involved a room change, I explained the situation to the front desk when checking in and asked if I could upgrade. The front desk staff directly said 4 words in a cold voice that upgrade cannot be done. The explanation does not provide a plan to add money to upgrade. 4. Although I was accidentally burned by the light bulb used to heat the dishes during breakfast, I did not complain. When I left the store, I made suggestions to prevent future customers from getting burned. 5. My mood was so low because I had to change rooms on the last day. I confirmed the order in the morning and was told to wait for the room to be cleaned before moving the luggage. After waiting for more than an hour, I didn‚Äôt take the initiative to inform me after the room was cleaned. I called myself to ask, and then the customer service asked politely. Should I come down and get the room key by myself or a colleague should send it to me? I said I would pack my luggage and the staff would bring it up. However, it turned out that the luggage was packed but the room key had not arrived yet. After urging, I was told that my colleague was already sending it to me. My daughter and I put the luggage and A bunch of things were plated out, and I waited at the door of the room for 10 minutes but the room card still hadn't been delivered. Finally, I urged me again, and after waiting for 5 minutes, I went down to get it myself. The receptionist didn't smile or explain. In the end, I thanked the guy for helping me get my luggage. In the afternoon, hotel Ctrip specialist Chloe gave explanations and prepared gifts for the children. Restaurant manager Sylvia called to greet them. I was very grateful to the two staff members for their arrangements and services. I sincerely hope that the hotel can provide good preliminary service and live up to everyone's trust and expectations for InterContinental Hotel. I believe that warm service can make up for the lack of facilities.

msg:You really shouldn‚Äôt be in a hurry when booking a hotel. If you do your homework in advance and read everyone‚Äôs reviews, you won‚Äôt fall into the trap. The five-star price here is not as comfortable as Home Inn Select. It looks high-end on the outside, but the rooms are rundown, like a guest house from the 1990s. The toilet is not smart, and the air conditioner is loud. Fortunately, I brought earplugs. The air is not circulating, the windows cannot be opened, and it is impossible to get some air. The air conditioner is too hot and there is a lack of oxygen. People with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases must not come. I sleep with the door open at night because of the boredom. I originally thought about it and let it go. The economy was in recession and I didn‚Äôt want to leave a negative review. But the breakfast the next morning made me determined to write a negative review. The child is a little over 1.2 meters, so the price is 98 yuan for half price, and 198 yuan for adults. It‚Äôs more expensive, but it‚Äôs just for fun. But except for the fruits, the food is fresh, and the rest are semi-finished products like fast food noodles, not ready-made. made. The rice noodles cannot be cooked soft and are too hard to digest. The child drank a glass of milk as soon as he came in, because the bread and fried rice (that's all they had) were very hard to eat. Let me say it again, at 198 yuan per person, you won‚Äôt be able to taste any meat at all. There are synthetic processed ham sausages and luncheon meat slices. Take a look at the pictures for yourself. Little variety and very cheap stuff. I think major companies are supporting this fake five-star hotel. Look at the people who come here to attend meetings at public expense, so don‚Äôt come here for family travel or vacation.

First of all, there were a lot of drinks in the refrigerator when I checked in. Fortunately, I called and asked if there was any charge. It turned out that some were charged and some were free, and they were all mixed together without any explanation! This obviously induces consumption! Then I cut off my hand at night and called the front desk to ask for iodophor disinfection. The front desk said: If it is available, it will be delivered directly. If not, it will be called to inform them. However, after waiting for nearly an hour, it was not delivered and there was no call. , called again and only sent 2 more. Also, the room is not tidied up properly. The previous person put in the waste paper and drew pictures and put them on the table but did not clean them up.

üöó Traffic Guide:
Hangzhou taxi is convenient and the price is very favorable
There are also Metro Line 7 nearby. Get off at the citizen center.
Highlights characteristics: The location is very good, the appearance is very distinctive, and I can also watch the Hangzhou light show at close range. I went in mid -January and two light shows a day a day 18: 30‚Äì18: 45; 19: 30‚Äì19: 45
Ê¥≤ Per capita consumption: Intercontinental hotels are not high in many five -star hotels in Hangzhou, about 1,000

üëç The most recommended:
If the room is not full, you can discuss a better location with the hotel, you can see the light show, or the Qiantang River, and the front desk lady who serves us is particularly good. There are many drinks for washing items. Thank you very much for your carefulness

üìå Tips:
There are 5 hotels in 7 hotels in this trip. The intercontinental hotels in Hangzhou are relatively long. I personally think that there are some old facilities in all aspects. The hotel has an old money style. It is not very fashionable. Some international chain hotels that opened in the year.

msg:As a landmark, you can basically see the Big Golden Ball in places promoting Hangzhou, so come to the InterContinental Hotel to experience it.

From the outside, it looks like layers of concentric circles. When you look inside, you will see another concentric circle. Because it corresponds to the sun in the sun and the moon, you can see that circles are used as the core of the design in many places. , including the circular entrance hall upon entering the room. There are also many decorations and embellishments in other places in the hotel that are circular elements.

I booked a river view room and could see the Qiantang River and the city balcony below. However, there has been smog in Hangzhou these days, and it was only white when I looked around.

Since the building is relatively spherical, the room is not completely square. If you look closely at the floor tiles, you can see that they are tilted at a small angle, including the large floor-to-ceiling glass, which is also tilted for this reason. It is still very unique, and it is quite interesting to compare the inside and outside of the building.

The breakfast is quite good, with rich varieties and good taste. I recommend the fried buns, which are quite juicy.

When the package was purchased, it only included one lunch, but later it was shown that there were two. The hotel said that the staff set it up incorrectly and gave two lunches directly. However, one lunch is quite large. It should be more than enough for two people. There is no need to order two portions.

The hotel is located in the CBD, so most of the people staying here are business travelers. You can also try it when traveling. After all, it is a landmark and is on the Qiantang River. It is also very convenient to travel to West Lake.

msg:Since it is a landmark in Hangzhou, I chose to stay at the InterContinental Hotel, but I was disappointed.

From the moment I got off the car and picked up my luggage to the moment I entered the hotel, the staff at the door kept chatting about OMO without even looking at me.

This time I made a reservation on Ctrip. Since I have been an Intercontinental Ambassador before, I called in advance to inquire whether the room booked by a third party could enjoy the Ambassador room upgrade. The answer was yes. But when I arrived at the front desk, I was told that third parties cannot enjoy it. OK, it depends on what you get offline. However, we have reasonable doubts about your front desk's business capabilities, and the inconsistent communication with guests twice caused people trouble.
When checking in, Chole at the front desk did not ask for member information and it was not related to the itinerary. So why would you apply for membership at your home? Once again, I doubted my business ability.

I had heard that his hardware facilities were poor before, but I didn't expect them to be so poor. The TV was crooked. It turned out that one of the hooks on the back where the TV was hung had fallen off. The cable on the TV in the bathtub is just hanging here casually. I won‚Äôt watch the next Death Comes unless the crew invites you.
I tried to lock the door at night and found that it wouldn't lock. I asked the staff to check and they said that after closing the door, I need to pull it back, otherwise the lock bolt cannot come out. I closed the door and still need to pull it back. Are you sure this is not an express hotel?
Wallpaper scratches, paint marks, and other problems abound. It has been like this for ten years since it has been open. If it had been open for as long as the Peace Hotel, it might not be like Iraq.

Hygiene is also a big problem. Every touch is dusty. There is a layer of dust visible to the naked eye on the TV in the bathtub. There was a thick layer of old dust inside the glass door of the bathroom area, which had not been cleaned at all.

I asked about changing pillows at 5:00 pm, and was told that all of them had been sent out. OK, it was a holiday, after all, there was a lot of traffic, so I understand (but the standard pillow provided by Intercontinental is really difficult to sleep on).

I can understand why the front desk didn't associate it with the itinerary. Is it because they were afraid that it would be easier to complain to you now that the itinerary was available? Then I have to complain now.

I booked two nights on Ctrip. There are so many things to worry about after just one night. Let‚Äôs see what else can be done tonight.

2. After all, it is a long-established star hotel, and its appearance is acceptable in all aspects. But after entering the room, I did feel that it was very old. There was a musty smell or something as soon as I entered the room. The bed and TV were very small, and there was no smart toilet or smart home. The carpet also looked dirty and old.
3. There is no service to speak of, and the breakfast is just average and enough to fill you up.
It's far from what I consider to be a star-rated hotel, and it's not worth the price.

There were many bad reviews online and I tried it out of luck, but it turned out that the experience was really bad... The decoration looked luxurious from the outside but it was really detailed. It looks a bit rusty... When I checked in, no one took my luggage and no one greeted me in time. It was quite troublesome to get to the hotel later. The front desk had to take the elevator once on the fifth floor and then another elevator if I stayed on the tenth floor. The service was really not good. Good review. It's not that they are indifferent or have a bad attitude. I just feel that some employees don't smile and are not friendly. Moreover, the breakfast is really terrible... I didn't know that I spent money to buy another one on the first day. There is not much variety. It tastes bad. I just don‚Äôt have much appetite. I also feel that some waiters treat tourists and foreigners or business people differently. I can‚Äôt say they are discriminatory but just indifferent. A hotel at this price actually charges extra for laundry and everything in the room. They all charge extra. I really feel like I don‚Äôt know what the room fee is spent on. The toilet facilities don‚Äôt even have a smart toilet... When I take a shower, the water is always cold and hot... Sigh... It really feels like it‚Äôs not worth it... The only good thing is to walk It was rare to see a lobby manager or receptionist smile and say goodbye to us, and then another took the luggage and put it in the car. There will be no next time. I gave two stars for really trying my best...

shortcoming:
1. The front desk efficiency was too slow when checking in. I couldn't find the order and asked me to wait. I contacted Ctrip customer service and solved the problem. I give Ctrip a thumbs up for this, so why can't the front desk take the initiative to help guests verify the situation! ! !
2. According to the reviews, many guests can upgrade their room type for free, so I asked the front desk, but was rejected directly - "cannot upgrade", which gave me a strong sense of disparity! ! !
I have given good reviews and hope some services can be improved.

Two days after leaving the hotel, I found a thermos bottle left behind. I called the front desk of the hotel and the hotel said that it needed to inquire and make inquiries. The cup was later found and sent back by courier. However, as a five-star hotel, not only should we proactively call guests to remind guests of items left behind, but they should also clean the room and register items left behind by previous guests. The service problem is not big, but it does not match the service of a 5-star hotel.

There is a subway station next to it, and there are many places to eat under the subway station. Some rooms have river views. It only takes about half an hour to take a taxi to the West Lake attractions. The disadvantage is that the hotel's buffet is a bit expensive, so you can choose to eat at the snack bar in the subway station next to it. There are many snack bars there. The hotel board is on the 5th floor and you have to go to the 5th floor and then move to the accommodation room, which is a bit strange. Those who book on Ctrip can enjoy free non-alcoholic drinks in the in-room ice bar.

The hotel staff did not communicate well in English. I found out what time the swimming pool opens and closes after talking to 3 people.

The complimentary afternoon tea, although I did not catch up with the normal time, I still confirmed by phone and left it at the front desk for me, thank you!
Special thanks to Sherry. After I left the store, I asked enthusiastically about the experience of staying in the store. It was very warm!

There are also mosquitoes in the room, it seems that there is no mosquito repellent liquid to be found. Breakfast: It looks like a lot of areas, but there are not many actual choices. But that's what I want to eat. Sanitary conditions are very good. It is very suitable for children to have breakfast, because there are fish to watch. There are also cutlery for children. Toiletries: There are no children's toiletries, and I told the front desk that there are children but there are no children's slippers. But I brought it myself. The front desk gave the kid a ball, and when we checked in, the room already had üà∂Ô∏èfruits, and the air conditioner was turned on to improve the air, which is very warm

msg:The city river view room can only be said to be average overall, and cannot meet the overall expectations of a five-star hotel in my heart.
Disadvantage 1: The USB socket at the head of the bed can't be charged, and it's useless after charging overnight! And there is a lack of two-hole sockets at the head of the bed, which is extremely lacking, which is a serious bad review. Later, I asked the front desk for a plug-in board (the plug-in board does not have a USB socket)
Disadvantage 2: The hair dryer is too old. Now, most five-star hotels are owned by Dyson. The blower in this hotel is comparable to that of a 2-star hotel. Can you imagine it! Bad review!
Disadvantage 3: The interior of the house is covered with carpets, which don't look clean, and the carpets have a lot of bacteria, which is not as clean and tidy as wooden floors.
Disadvantage 4: The ventilation in the room is poor, there are no safety windows to open, and the clothes cannot be dried naturally after washing. Basically, a hair dryer is required to dry them manually. In addition, I did not go to Hangzhou during the summer vacation, but in mid-May.
All in all, the facilities of this hotel are really not good. One night including breakfast is 1400‚ûï, which is expensive, so why not renovate it? The Asian Games are coming soon! !

Breakfast: quite satisfactory, freshly made noodles, rice noodles, etc., are basically five-star standard. Nothing.

msg:I stayed with my family during the May Day holiday. It was a perfect accommodation experience. The hotel is on the edge of the Qiantang River. The surrounding environment is very beautiful and the transportation is convenient. The subway exit is right outside the door. The InterContinental Hotel Hangzhou is also the Hangzhou International Conference Center, which belongs to the high-end of five-star hotels. Whether it is hygiene, service, room facilities, etc., it belongs to the upper-level of five-star hotels, and it is very good in all aspects.
     During holidays, many five-star hotels have everything else good, but there are not enough breakfast seats and parking spaces on holidays, and there are long queues waiting for seats at the entrance of the restaurant, which greatly reduces the leisure time of staying guests during holiday travel. They are always worried about getting up in the morning to eat breakfast If you don‚Äôt have a seat, you don‚Äôt dare to sleep late. However, the entire lobby of the InterContinental Hotel in Hangzhou is full of restaurant seats, so that guests don‚Äôt have to worry about no seats, and it‚Äôs very comfortable to eat breakfast. There are also a lot of parking spaces in the underground parking lot, so don't worry about no parking spaces if you come back late.
   In addition, the shape of this hotel is also very unique, it is in the shape of a sphere, and it looks beautiful from the inside or the outside. The photos I attached are from the exterior and interior of the hotel, as well as photos of the restaurant and rooms. In short, this is what I have stayed in. It's a very perfect five-star hotel. Next time I come to Hangzhou, I will continue to stay at InterContinental Hotel Hangzhou.

The hotel is located in Qiantang River New Town, a landmark building in Binjiang. The golden ball is likened to the sun, and the Grand Theater next to it is a combination of the moon and the city light. The hotel's breakfast buffet is very rich, the surrounding environment is very good, the subway is also very convenient, and there is also a shopping paradise outlets. In short, the InterContinental Hotel left us with an unforgettable impression, and gave us beautiful gifts when we checked out.

Because there were no river-view twin rooms, I booked a superior twin room. The floor was arranged for me on the 8th floor, but I was satisfied. I could see a little of the river. scene
Location: The InterContinental Hotel is on Jiefang East Road. There is a subway in front of the hotel. If you drive by yourself, you can park in the hotel's underground garage for free. There are quite a lot of locations

Service: The service is good. I made a reservation on Ctrip. Because I am a member, I can redeem the benefits of welcome fruit. The welcome fruit is already on the table when I enter the room, and it is quite fresh.

Environment: The environment of the hotel is good, and the decoration is quite festive

Hygiene: The sanitation of the hotel is also quite clean. The cleaning is quite clean. There is also an anti-epidemic bag on the bedside table. Please like this

Facilities: The bathroom is separated from wet and dry. There is a large bathtub with a lot of water. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because of the low floor. I feel that the cloakroom is not as big as the one on the tenth floor.
    The hotel's breakfast is okay, the room includes two breakfasts, it's cheaper if another person buys it on the spot, 98 per person
    I don't know if it's because the hotel has been open for a long time. The reading light on one side of our room is not on. We called the engineering depar**ent and came to fix it.
     Overall, it's good, and I'll choose to stay again if I have a chance in the future

msg:The InterContinental in the Golden Globe has been to Hangzhou many times. This time I finally had the opportunity to come here to open the eyes of the InterContinental. I have to say that the InterContinental brand is often loved and hated, because the standards of the InterContinental across the country are uneven. It‚Äôs too powerful, there will be surprises and shocks, but generally speaking, the general standard of the newly opened InterContinental is not bad, while the general standard of the InterContinental opened in the old building is generally lower, and of course there are some. Quite a few, after all, there are too few players like Ruijin Intercontinental that can rely on the external environment to win points.
The InterContinental in Hangzhou is easy to find, but when I got down to the garage, I was shocked by the yellow and white walls. It felt like I had come to the inside of an underground bunker... The overall style suddenly dropped a lot, and I felt a little bit in my heart at the time , It's not good... The parking spaces in the parking lot are also crooked, maybe it has something to do with the spherical layout... Anyway, it's not very easy to park, and it's easy to get lost when looking for a car. Pay attention to your walking route and signs. If you want to leave, just register your license plate number with the front desk, and you can come in and out for free all day, which is quite convenient.
The elevator in the garage goes to the fifth floor, and you can come to the central hall after a few steps. The reception is also here. The layout of the overall hall is quite beautiful, with layers of lines, and it is easy to produce films. I had an intercontinental ambassador that day, so check-in was done at the ihg VIP center next door, which was very convenient. Thanks to the exchange rate, the ambassador qualification was only 1,300 points. I also gave two drink coupons, but I didn‚Äôt upgrade the room type. Topics like this, but I booked a river view room, so it doesn't matter if I upgrade or not. The young lady in the vip center is very friendly. She talks to you softly and is very patient. She communicated with me about the SNP system. This is quite a plus. I also observed a little bit. Here The ladies at the front desk are all very good-looking, and their work uniforms also show their figure, which is quite impressive.
The room was arranged directly opposite the elevator, and the distance is indeed a bit far. In addition to the small fruit plate of the original gold card, a larger fruit plate and a bottle of red wine were sent. In addition, it is said that the drink bar can serve all drinks except alcoholic beverages. Access is free, so I'm welcome! Pack it all up and take it away.
The room is very big, and the facilities are in warm colors. It looks a bit old. I personally like the simple black and white and luxurious feeling of Quanzhou Intercontinental, so the decoration here is actually a little disappointing. Jiangjing It‚Äôs okay, but it may be affected by the spherical shell. The glass is curved and there are many beams, so the photo framing is not very ideal (it‚Äôs not good-looking), although it faces the city balcony and the music square Fountain show, but because of the color-changing glass, there is nothing to take pictures of... I wonder if the room upstairs will be better... In addition, the mattress here is from Simmons, so it is the same as before The mattresses I have slept on are a bit different, and they feel a little harder. I personally prefer the one with a sinking feeling, but it is not a very important thing.
The buffet here is on the side of the central hall, which is more in line with the Intercontinental style, but it doesn't feel too innovative and new. Relatively speaking, the variety is not particularly rich, and they all meet your basic needs. There are no better ingredients or options. There are quite a lot of people at the noodle stall, but it feels messy to run over. I don‚Äôt know whether to take it by myself or tell the chef what I want directly. Seeing that they are all busy, I don‚Äôt eat. There are both Chinese and Western styles, and the overall is okay, but there are still many details that can be improved... I think you can refer to the buffet breakfast at Mandarin Oriental.
The overall feeling is that the performance of the service staff is not bad. The facilities and rooms are relatively average. There are many details that can be improved, but there are some parts that are limited by the hardware. The appearance is very beautiful. I don‚Äôt know if it will be the next time I would choose this place, after all, the price of Conrad next door is about the same...

msg:I want to complain about this hotel 1. I checked in at four o'clock and said there was no twin room to wait. After waiting for two hours, there was no room at six o'clock in the evening! I had no choice but to protest! If you don't protest, you don't know how long you will have to wait for a room! But after protesting, the room attendant gave me an upgraded suite, but I couldn't see the river view at all, and it was a big bed. I had to go to the front desk to negotiate and protest. Although the room given for the second time is considered a river view room, it is still a double bed room (if I want a double bed room, why should I wait for two hours)? This time, I went directly to the manager on duty to make a complaint call. I decided to save myself. After this action, I finally got a twin room! It can be regarded as a real upgraded room. The front desk clerk said that because many housekeepers went home for the New Year, the room cleaning was slow. But I have a question: Why do the housekeepers clean up the double bed room but not the twin bed room? Specially arrange the double bed room but not the twin bed room? Or is the twin room oversold or something? This time it took a total of three hours from CHECKIN at 4 pm to check-in completion. So I decided to give Intercontinental a bad review.

The room service is slightly insufficient. I called twice to ask someone to send more bottled water, but in the end it didn't come. Maybe there is a shortage of staff during the Spring Festival. The other front desks and cafeterias are very timely and have a good attitude.

A pair of slippers were not delivered after two calls, which is unacceptable. It is a basic service of the hotel. If there is not enough staff, it can be delayed, but it cannot be ignored. As a result, the family did not sleep well at night. In addition, the alarm clock on the bedside table has a negative review. The second hand is too noisy. Such details were not considered!

Hygiene: The room I live in is very clean.
Environment: There is nothing to say about the location of the hotel, opposite the Grand Theater. City Balcony is a five minute walk. Raffles City is a ten minute walk.
Service: The service is very good, because I checked in on the second day of New Year's Day, and I also gave drinks from the minibar. The housekeeper, Robert, was very enthusiastic and helped us take our luggage to the room. Give the children a bath set and a small schoolbag.

msg:The location of the Intercontinental is very good. Next to the subway station. It is more convenient to go to major attractions. The service in the hotel is quite satisfactory. I feel that because of the epidemic, the type or quality of the hotel‚Äôs buffet breakfast is not as strong as before. For example, use low-grade dragon fish to fry fish fillets. Looks good, but tastes really weird. Hope it will be better next time. This big golden ball is indeed a very important symbol, within walking distance to Sand Ship Outlets, Hangzhou Grand Theater, and City Balcony. In addition, it is not far to go to Raffles Vientiane City, etc. But there was no light show twice when I went there, and I hope there will be in the future.
I am personally very satisfied with the hotel. Although it is a little bit old, the grade is still very high. The city view and water view from the window are very beautiful. It is that the glass windows have obvious stains, which is a fly in the oin**ent.
In general, I am very satisfied, and I will still live again.

When I came in from the gate, there was a handsome little brother who helped me with my luggage. , The check-in place is on the fifth floor, which is a very unique design, and the check-in speed is also very fast. The girl who checked me in was a girl named Rachel. She was very considerate and introduced the hotel to me in detail Surrounding shopping malls, and how to get to popular attractions such as West Lake.

First of all, the hotel has a strong awareness of epidemic control. The health code will be checked when entering the door, and the hotel will be checked again when checking in on the fifth floor. During the hotel stay, the staff will remind guests to wear masks, which makes people feel at ease
Secondly, the service of the hotel is very good. When Benjamin at the front desk saw people coming from our province, he took the initiative to remind me of the three inspections in three days and told me where the nucleic acid was located. My brother Robert saw that I was reasoning about two large suitcases and offered to help me put them away. The luggage was sent to the room, and the service was proactive and considerate.
I like the final room I arranged very much. It has large floor-to-ceiling windows, the room is clean and tidy, and the equipment is very comfortable. During the stay, the health code accidentally turned yellow. I went to the front desk to ask for help. The little girl Lisa explained to me in detail and took the initiative to add WeChat to help me declare. I am really grateful.

In today's hotel service standards are generally stretched, Manager John's warm and thoughtful and professional service has allowed me to experience the standard of a luxury hotel once again. Getting to know John was the last time I was there when something went wrong and John helped fix it. Then I knew that I was staying again this time, and after confirming the stay time with me in advance, I was already waiting at the door of the hotel before I arrived. He then helped check in all the way and took me into the room personally. Repeatedly confirmed my check-in needs and introduced the hotel's facilities and catering opening hours in detail. At the same time, I informed the latest nucleic acid point and personally guided me to the door, because the room booked this time has a 300 yuan catering deduction. , John not only helped to book a place, but also very enthusiastically introduced the dishes of the Chinese restaurant and made recommendations according to my preferences. The products of the Chinese restaurant also surprised me. The sweet and sour shrimp balls and roast duck were very delicious. The manager, Jim, came to greet me and asked about the dining experience. The entire experience of this stay was excellent.

It would be a pity to live in Qianjiang New Town without staying at the InterContinental Hotel. During the stay, it happened to be during the National Day, and the five-star red flags were hung on the circular glass railings in the hotel, which seemed to add a lot of festive a**osphere. InterContinental Hotel should be the most loved overseas hotel brand in China. The hardware and decoration in the room are outdated, after all, it has been a long time. The most conspicuous are the window screens. In fact, if the store owner replaces the window screens with new ones, the visual sense of the guests can be greatly improved. The changing room and swimming pool of the swimming pool on the 18th floor are not very old. It should be that the material selection and design in the early stage of construction are excellent and advanced. The food service is great and the food safety rating is A. There is also a full-day Golden Globe theater service during the holidays, which should also be unique. The Hangzhou Grand Theater is right next to it. If it is convenient to watch a concert, the performers are likely to choose to stay nearby. Will stay again when I see a concert in the future.

Hygiene: Clean!
Environment: The spherical shape of the hotel is very distinctive. Next to it is the Hangzhou Grand Theater. There will be a fountain music and light show at night. The children are very excited to see it.
Service: There will be a dedicated service staff at the elevator entrance. We were a young girl when we checked in. The service is very good. If you have any questions, you will answer them patiently and in detail. Unfortunately, I forgot to ask her name. The next day, a boy served obviously. Too bad, the front desk sara is also good.
Breakfast: Compared with other intercontinental breakfasts, the breakfast in this restaurant is slightly inferior.

It also specially upgraded the room type for us, with a panoramic view of the river, and also upgraded the free room water. Well, special thanks to Manager Robert. The breakfast at the hotel is very good. There will be some differences after staying for two days. This is really full of details, and the check-out process is not complicated.

msg:"Looking for Guizi in the middle of the moon in the mountain temple, watching the tide on the pillow of the county pavilion". Going to Hangzhou for the Mid-Autumn Festival, going to Lingyin Temple to burn incense, and watching the tide of Qianjiang from the balcony of the city, it is the most suitable to live in Intercontinental. This is a charming hotel with the appearance of a golden planet. Seeing this round of golden balls in the night, even if you can't see the moon on the Mid-Autumn Festival night, you will have no regrets. The warm and attentive service and bright smiles of Rachel and Sara at the front desk are definitely worthy of this world-class hotel. Because Ctrip couldn't choose the orientation, Rachel enthusiastically chose a room near the river for me, and I could see the Asian Games Center across the river, which was really invincible. I will stay here when I come to Hangzhou in the future.

msg:On a business trip to Hangzhou, I took my 9-month-old baby out for the first time. Booked a small yellow duck parent-child room

Advantages: convenient transportation, unrepeatable location, good river view room, walk 100 meters to the subway station, 300 meters to the city balcony, the surrounding road conditions are better than the old city, and the parking lot is large. Great for holding wedding banquets and conferences, business is good, and the service is very warm

Disadvantages: The facilities are old, the house is dim, it may be to take care of the overall external landscape, and have requirements for brightness.. The baby doesn't like it very much... The height of the children's bed is quite deep, but the bed rail cannot be put down and it is laborious to sleep in. The last one slept floor.. 

The elevator has to be transferred on the 5th floor, which is a little inconvenient.

The children's playground is now being renovated due to the epidemic. It would be much better if it was opened.

The breakfast was mediocre. To walk to the opposite restaurant, you have to cross the subway station, and there are some options to cross the road through the underground passage; there is also the Sand Boat Plaza on the north side. You can go directly from the underground passage at 5:30 for dinner, or you can rely on takeaway.

Next time I take my baby, I will choose Senbo, or a hotel with a new decoration, which is brighter..

msg:Originally, the trip to Hangzhou was very pleasant, and I was satisfied with all aspects of staying at the InterContinental Hotel for two nights, but the problem occurred when I left Hangzhou on the return train and found that the gel medicine that needed to be refrigerated was forgotten in the hotel refrigerator, so I called the hotel. Confirm, the number 57189810000, I don't know whether the front desk or which depar**ent staff answered, when it was confirmed that it was indeed left in the hotel, I proposed to check out from 1:30 to 7:00 p.m. to return to the hotel to pick up the luggage for more than five hours, why not No one contacted the customer in time. The operator did not apologize, but the first sentence was that we couldn't contact the customer so quickly, because a lot of things were left behind every day. We are short of manpower. It is SF Express that pays me on delivery. I suggested that the hotel is also responsible and my items must be refrigerated. I replied that I would send Ems to the hotel to pay, but it would be slower and I didn‚Äôt raise the issue of refrigeration. When I said that I couldn‚Äôt accept it, I actually felt in my heart. I don't plan to send it to the hotel because it has no practical significance at all, but I am dissatisfied with the hotel's handling attitude and ability. After checking out, you will check whether the refrigerator is consumed and then refund the deposit. You can't find the missing items for a few hours. The guest is a human. It is normal to leave things behind when you go out. A brand hotel that is trustworthy in my impression has no depar**ent staff to deal with such matters, and the receptionist hangs up without saying a word after I express my dissatisfaction on the phone. I dropped the call and switched to the music prompt. My dissatisfaction reached the limit. I don‚Äôt know who this female operator is. At least the service concept and quality made me unbelievable that I was an employee of InterContinental. After staying for two days, all my goodwill was destroyed. I'm sorry, this is the first time I gave a bad review to the hotel. I can barely accept the hotel's ability to work. The staff's tough attitude made me feel like a different world from the time I checked in. This bad review is for you. The female operator

I made the first call from 3:30 pm, and clearly told the front desk to be a little faster, I was at 4 o‚Äôclock I had to rush to do the nucleic acid test half a time ago. The front desk said that someone would be sent immediately and told me to wait in the room. I waited until 4:15 and no one came. I couldn‚Äôt wait to run to do the nucleic acid first, but I still didn‚Äôt catch up, 4:00 Half received a call from the front desk, but they came up and asked me why I wasn't waiting for them in the room? I'm so pissed
3 The efficiency of the front desk is too low. It takes 7 to 10 minutes for one person to open a room and apply for a room card. There are two front desks in total. There are fewer windows than the bank, and the work is slower.
4. During breakfast, every time I ask the waiter if there is any coffee, they will say, you ask the waiter to make it for you, and I ask who is the waiter? They'll all look around for a while, point to a guy dressed like him and say you're looking for him.
5. At around 6:00, someone knocked on the door. Before I got to the door, she knocked on the door twice and actually opened the door by herself? ! I said what are you doing, she said send me a newspaper...
5. In conclusion, after staying for three days, there are "surprises" every day, except for the architectural design and location, the experience is very poor

msg:A very famous Internet celebrity hotel in Hangzhou, I brought my parents to stay on New Year's Day. I didn't see it was renovated 10 years ago before booking. But it seems to be well maintained.
However, some facilities are too old, such as plug interfaces. The power supply at the head of the bed was useless, so I had to go to the hotel for a plug-in board! The quality of breakfast is average. Compared with other continents, the quality is really not superior. I can also understand that there are fewer customers now. The night view of the hotel is still very good.

Sara and Shirley at the front desk helped me upgrade the room very well, and left a room facing the moon on the 15th floor for us. Unfortunately, due to the epidemic, I didn't see the light show at night, and there was still some rain that day, and the visual effect of the landscape window was not good. It was a pity.
        There is absolutely nothing to say about the hotel location, you can walk to all major shopping malls, and breakfast is also very good. The bathroom of the room is particularly large. Although the hotel was built earlier and the facilities are not as advanced as the current Internet celebrity hotel, it does not affect the comfort. It is still worth the experience of staying.

msg:I have lived in many intercontinental cities, and the experience is very good. Hangzhou's Golden Globe is the most disappointing. The first is service, a blunt smile, and programmatic service. You also need to be more attentive in service. The room 886 you stayed in is facing a construction site. The service staff also said that a room with a better view has been specially selected for you. After entering, the bath water will be cold and hot, the engineering depar**ent staff will increase the temperature of the water, it is not obvious to ignore the cold, but can the temperature of the hands be the same as the body temperature? The double bed room is very small, and the facilities in the room are quite outdated. Air-conditioning heating is not provided in this season, and the room is 22 degrees Celsius. Not recommended for those with children. Switching to the 11th floor has a good view and you can see the light show. Let‚Äôs talk about breakfast. There are few types and low edibility. You tiao, steamed buns, snacks, and bread are mostly semi-finished products. The presentation and taste of the hot dishes are also very ordinary, greasy, and the dishes have not changed for two days. The gym only has four treadmills. There is no convenience store or snack bar nearby, which is not very convenient.

msg:Qixi Festival‚ûïSummer vacation, the price is considered a conscience price compared to surrounding resort hotels. The appearance of the hotel is not big, but when I go in, I find that the space is actually quite large.
     The room area is not small and the view is good. The bedding is warm and dry, making it comfortable to sleep. The bath water is large and the bath products taste good. There is no musty smell as some comments say, even if you can't open the window, the room freshener smells good. The waiters and bellboys in the lobby, as well as the few guys at the elevator entrance, including the beautiful women who clean the windows and serve them, are all professional and active and enthusiastic.
       If there is room for improvement, I hope that the quality of the breakfast buffet will be improved. Children under the age of 11 should pay half price no matter how tall they are. Putting some welcome fruit in the room will make the hotel feel more warm.

Especially worth mentioning is the hotel‚Äôs service. Thank you Lisa and Jennifer at the front desk very much. The quality of service is too high.

I stayed in a river-view king-size bed room, and I could see the Qiantang River view from the bed. The facilities in the room are complete and I am satisfied with the disposable products.
The gym and swimming pool are on the upper floors and the area is not too big.
The breakfast buffet is on the fifth floor, and the breakfast is quite rich, especially the variety of juices.
During the stay, there was road construction at the entrance of the hotel. During the day, a slight noise was heard in the room. It is said that the subway was being repaired.

At more than 1pm when we arrived, the front desk said that the room had not been cleaned, so let's sit in the lobby and wait. Okay, we can only wait. During this period, I said that the check-in procedure should be done first. During the pre-authorization, I said that the system is broken, and I need to change the machine and wait for the operation. Then continue to wait. The interns at the front desk at the back are really sorry and apologize for sending us the fruits. . After a while, we will give us room 15 and then it will be on the 12th floor. This time, we entered the room smoothly at 4 o'clock. We entered the room at 1568 and said that there was another room that was not good. We waited again. The final result Just moved us all to the 12th floor. It‚Äôs a bit hard to say... Picture one is the trash I saw on the day of check-in, and it was there when I checked out on the third day.

It is estimated that it was a double bed room changed from a twin room. There is a ball of paper under the table. I don't know why... By the side of the trash can, the cleaning may not be complete. The Qiantang River Room is quite good. You can try the higher-level River View Room next time. Breakfast is not much left because of the late breakfast, which is not bad. The location is very good, with Ole downstairs and Raffles opposite.

The room is small and the most unacceptable five-star hotel that can supply mineral water is too low price. The bed is only 1.2 meters and two adults‚ûï the two children are really crowded, and the price of 1200+ is arbitrary. Booking a family suite outside is more comfortable than this!
