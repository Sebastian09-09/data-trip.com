I asked if I could upgrade my room and how much it would cost me. The man, who could speak English, answered, ‚ÄúVery expensive,‚Äù without telling me the actual price. I asked again, and he said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs 1500 per night‚Äù. I couldn‚Äôt believe that and looked at the exact cost of booking a new room. It was 1000. I came back and asked him again, saying that it could not be that an upgrade was more expensive than booking a new room. He changed his answer, saying, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs 700‚Äù. I asked him to tell me the exact number, but he just used some numbers from his head. I was very disappointed that he treats guests like that.

msg:The hotel is nicely decorated and looks new & well taken care of. Alhough I think they could add air conditioning to some of the hallways. 
Rooms are clean and spacious, though ours said "sea view", the balcony had a wall that prevented us from enjoying it while sitting. You have to stand and look over to get a glimpse of the bay. 
The breakfast menu had some Western choices, but it's mostly Chinese. Lunch and dinner mostly Chinese, BUT the quality of the food was good, while prices are very affordable. I also appreciate that I didn't have to pay meals for my two daughters. 
The swimming pool is definitely the biggest feature of this place. With lots of shades, and the kids section very convenient for the children to play. 
They have floaters but you have to pay to rent them. Towels are free to use. 
One setback is the "beach"/bay in front of it, it's not for swimming. So if you're looking for a beach and all water sports to have a good time, this hotel is not for you.

The lobby manager Xiao Fu is very enthusiastic and can introduce the hotel facilities to you and answer all your questions during the trip, giving you a feeling of being bathed in spring breeze. Although it is an old hotel, it has done a good job in maintenance and does not make people feel old. It is very convenient to go to the beach, with direct access to the beach. There is also a lobby bar in the lobby with many new products. We tried the new coffee, which was very good. The lobby bar waiter was also very good and thoughtful. He helped us prepare ice cubes and takeaway tape for us to take away if we couldn‚Äôt finish it. I like the lobby bar waiter! There are many places to eat around the hotel. Of course, the hotel also has its own restaurant with a variety of choices. There is also a small town nearby. It is really lively at night. Recommended

The room is well decorated and very relaxing to stay in. Due to personal reasons, I asked the housekeeping department for help with some minor problems. Manager Fu was very good and helped us enthusiastically. Thank you very much. It feels like home. After checking in, I went to the beach after resting. The beach is right at the door of the hotel. You can reach the beach when you leave the hotel. The sea in Sanya Bay is still very good. The beach is clean and long. Every time the children come to play, they can pick up their favorite shells and marine life. It is very convenient to go back to the hotel to rest after playing. After staying in so many hotels, Yingbin Hotel is like a sense of security at home in my mind. I also like the hotel breakfast. I will choose Yingbin Hotel next time I come to Sanya.

But I found that it was the most perfect ending of the trip. The room is very clean. Although it was renovated earlier, there is no odor, and even the towels are very new and soft. There are many swimming pools in the hotel, which can be divided very well. The environment is very good, and it is close to the beach. It is quieter and more private than other hotels. It is the best day to rest at night. When it comes to service, Guan Jiafei will carefully call to inquire about the specific situation before checking in, and specially arrange toothbrushes and slippers before rushing, which really meets the six-star service standard. The hotel breakfast is also remarkable, rich and diverse, and the taste is not inferior to other big-name hotels, and the price-performance ratio exceeds expectations. If the plane is transiting, this hotel must be the best choice. Looking forward to meeting again next time.

Because I only planned to transition, I booked the smallest mini room~ Fortunately, I met Manager Fu. When he learned that we were traveling as a couple, he made a special honeymoon arrangement for us and upgraded the room. The whole stay experience was very pleasantly surprised. The hotel has its unique sense of age, but the facilities and hygiene are still good~ It is worth noting that there are 2 mini room packages on the 2 platforms, 100 yuan apart, but the content is exactly the same... I booked the more expensive one, thinking it was the difference between double breakfast and single breakfast, but I didn't expect it to be single breakfast... In addition, the quality of the ingredients for the paid buffet dinner could be improved.

I especially thank the waiter Dong Zhuling (apar**ent room number 210802) for her serious and polite service. I was very happy living here. The lobby and swimming pool were beautiful, clean and tidy. The breakfast was rich and of good quality. I will have the opportunity to come back to enjoy the service of your hotel in the future. Thank you!

msg:Facilities: The only drawback is that the air conditioning was not turned on in advance. This time, a total of 4 hotels and 1 homestay were booked. The air conditioning was turned on 24 hours a day in the other hotels.
Hygiene: Good
Environment: Good
The coconut milk Qingbuliang in the lobby bar is not tasty in my opinion. The marshmallow softened immediately in Sanya.

Sanya Bay is close to the airport. I stayed here when I came and stayed at the Pullman Haiju Hotel when I left. I found a problem. Both hotels are Coconut Dream Corridor, but there are fewer shells on the beach at the Guest House. I found that there are a lot of shells on the beach at the Pullman Haiju Hotel.

The crabs in Sanya Bay are very stupid. If you bring children, it is suitable to dig sand crabs here. It is easy to dig (the sand crabs in Yalong Bay are more cunning and difficult to dig)

There was a step in the bathroom so the children could sit and take a bath. The breakfast at the hotel was OK, but the food was not replenished in time. There was no cucumber shreds in the noodle making area. , I asked three times for two people to wait for 15 minutes before they came. The children loved the bubble bath at 17 o'clock.

msg:I have stayed here many times. I will give a truthful evaluation. I was a little unhappy during the stay. I hope you can make progress.
1. I know that you are close to the airport and it will be noisy. I specially noted the quiet room in the order, but I ignored it.
2. It doesn't cost much to replace all the power *****s in the room with USB. I have borrowed a plug from the concierge for several consecutive years. This time, I was refused. He said he didn't have it. He should have led me to check in, but he didn't. If I didn't know your room, I would have spent a lot of time looking for this room.
3. The breakfast is getting worse and worse. The category never changes, and it is getting more and more confusing. It's better not to host breakfast. The girl who cooks noodles smashes the tableware. Who is she showing it to?
4. The screen window is broken and should be replaced as soon as possible. The floor drain smells and attracts insects.
Advantages: Ctrip helped to upgrade the room type and I am quite satisfied

msg:Bad review for the male manager with glasses in the store. My family went on a trip and everything was good overall. We upgraded the room and should have been very happy. But something unexpected happened. The air conditioner cover in the room fell off at 2 a.m. It was a material problem and it made a loud noise. We thought it was an earthquake. Later we found out that it was the air conditioner cover above our heads. We contacted the hotel immediately. The female manager who came to deal with it was very nice. I asked her to deal with it the next day and wanted to go back to sleep. The next day, a male manager with glasses came. He was very nice at first. I thought it was nothing, I was just scared, so I accepted the hotel's afternoon tea and self-service compensation and didn't want to embarrass anyone. As a result, my good talk was exchanged for the bad attitude of the male manager with glasses on the third day. The afternoon tea also changed. It was not afternoon tea for three people, but one cup of coffee or lemonade per person, and four cookies per person. Haha, it was really... After unpleasant negotiations, the drinks did not change, but they could be replaced with one piece of cut snack per person. When we left the hotel, the male manager with glasses was even more excessive. When he saw us leaving the hotel with our luggage, he turned and left. Is this the service that a lobby manager should have? It was your air conditioner cover that scared me, and I accepted your decision. Am I too easy to talk to? Should I have asked you to take me to the hospital for a checkup and then compensate me for the cost of my delayed trip?
I later complained to Ctrip.

In the afternoon, there are beautiful women playing guzheng in the lobby. There are resident singers in the evening. You can enjoy the sea breeze and eat barbecue. It is very comfortable.
Enter the room
Facilities: The decoration looks a bit old after all, it was renovated in 18 years, but everything else is satisfactory. The air conditioning blows quickly and makes no noise.
Hygiene: It is clean and the cleaning lady is very good. Because we slept in and got up very late on vacation, she asked the cleaning lady to wait for us to clean.

Service: The welcome to the hotel is very warm, and the front desk is average. After we settled in 14XX, we were told to take the elevator on the right. Because it was our first time to come, we didn‚Äôt know there were two elevators. We walked up to the first elevator and went up. When we got to the 14th floor, there was no elevator. 14XX came down again and asked the front desk, saying that there was another elevator going inside. A young lady guided us and we took the second elevator up. Although this is a small thing, why not remind customers of such a small thing? How do many customers know that there are 2 elevators when they check in for the first time? No matter how big your hotel is, and you are in the service industry, you should note that since it is a luxury hotel, the front desk service should be worthy of this luxury, and the professional quality needs to be improved.
The hotel bed, pillows and quilts are all very comfortable.


Lobby bar coconut milk refreshment: not bad.

msg:For this stay, I will give negative reviews as well as positive reviews! The bad review is for some irresponsible staff at the front desk; the good review is for Mr. Fu Zhongren of Junlan Hotel. Mr. Fu has a strong sense of responsibility and is considerate to customers. From him, we feel the service quality of a five-star hotel. If your staff can be as dedicated as Mr. Fu, I believe that the Guest House will receive rave reviews! Business is getting more and more prosperous!
Reason for negative review:
1. Due to hotel operation problems, only one of the two rooms we originally booked was reserved. As a result, my elderly parents and my 1-year-old baby were unable to check in on time. It was past 10 pm on the day we arrived at the hotel. We were tired and hungry. We spent nearly an hour coordinating with the front desk to no avail. Finally, after complaining on the platform, the front desk manager solved the problem, which seriously affected our rest and meals, as well as our subsequent itinerary. Very, very mood-affecting.
2. During the trip, we stayed in other hotels for a few days. After checking out at the Guest House, we found that the power cord of the baby kettle was left on the socket in the hotel room. So we contacted the front desk for help, but the reply from the front desk was "After careful inspection, they did not find our charging cable." Finally, we found the power cord quietly plugged into the wall socket on the left hand side of the entrance in the room we stayed in... I would like to ask the gentleman at the front desk who answered the phone, are you really not embarrassed at all? ? ?

msg:We stayed here for 4 nights during the 2024 Chinese New Year holiday. Sanya is known as China's Hawaii, and during this time of year it is popular as people from colder regions flock to the area seeking warmth, and the whole area, including tourist spots, was very crowded.
I chose this hotel because of the location. People often come by plane from various parts of China, but for some reason there are many early morning/night flights. In my case, I arrived after 8pm, so I needed access between the airport and the hotel.
I focused on it. This hotel is conveniently located a 15-minute drive from the airport. You can't get there by airport bus, so you'll have to take a taxi/ride share, but it's a long wait, but it's convenient because it's close by.
This is a very popular place at this time of year, so as with all hotels, it can be expensive to book last minute, so be sure to book early.
Well, the hotel has three pools and a beach right in front of you, giving you a sense of privacy. It's not new by any means, but it's thoroughly cleaned and the staff are friendly.
Service is fine. Free plastic bottles, refrigerators, and other amenities are also above standard. All plumbing fixtures are made by American KOHLER, giving you peace of mind, and showering is instant.
Hot water comes out and the amount of water is OK. Breakfast is buffet style and is standard in both variety and taste. Tea service in the evening in the lobby, live koto music, and BBQ while listening to live music in the courtyard for dinner.
You can spend a very relaxing time with a lot of resort feeling.
Access to major tourist spots is not a problem as there are local buses right in front of the hotel and you can easily call a taxi/ride. However, depending on the season, the areas along the beach and near each tourist spot are extremely crowded.
This is a problem that Sanya City can't do anything about unless it comes up with a countermeasure because it causes traffic congestion. In my case, I managed to survive with a behavioral pattern of leaving early in the morning and returning in the afternoon.
After noon, we took a relaxing break by the hotel's pool.
Sanya resort in the middle of summer during the cold winter season...This hotel provides sufficient services to enjoy this, so we highly recommend it!

msg:The most cost-effective hotel in Haitang Bay, Meiya Four Seasons Hotel arrived and found out that it was renovated from a retirement apar**ent project. If you want to live near Haitang Bay at a low price, this is a good choice. It has complete facilities, but it lacks the beach. The house is big enough and has a washing machine. This is the cheapest hotel I can find in this area. The main reason for staying here is that this beach is better and it is relatively close to Houhai Village on Wuzhizhou Island, but the location is a bit remote. A bit, food prices are much cheaper than in the city. It is close to duty-free shops, attractions, Atlantis and Haichang, so it is a compromise choice.

msg:The room is relatively old. Although it has been renovated before, many places are seriously aged.
Environment: It is on the beach, separated by a road, and it is very convenient to get to the beach.
Service: The service at the front desk was very good. There was someone to help with my luggage when I got off the bus. The room I booked included a breakfast voucher. The front desk probably thought I didn‚Äôt need it so they didn‚Äôt help me get it. As a result, my husband asked for it when he arrived at the hotel the next morning. When having breakfast, the waiter at the door of the restaurant asked me to go to the front desk to get it before I can use it. Can't your hotel coordinate and get it done with just one phone call? I said there was no way I could win, even if I took my mobile phone order to the front desk to handle it for me, the waiter was still unwilling to cooperate even though I tried every possible means. I told the waiter that I was on the train at ten o'clock in the morning. Running back and forth might cause the train to be late. The waiter questioned me about the train at ten o'clock and it was only after eight o'clock. The waiter had no intention of helping me solve the problem. He acted like you can't get in without it. Attitude, the attitude of wanting to quarrel with guests at one point, I would give a negative review to this type of waiter.
Facilities: All three swimming pools in the hotel are open, and each swimming pool is equipped with lifeguards. There is a bubble show in the afternoon, and the little friends have a lot of fun.

You can go to Nanshan, Tianya Haijiao, and West Island. Nearly, already saved, come back next time

msg:To be honest, it's a pretty good hotel. It has everything you need for a five-diamond hotel. The service and breakfast are both good. However, the hotel's carrying capacity needs to be considered more. When there are more people, there are not enough breakfast seats and pool loungers, which greatly reduces the experience.
The hotel is sandwiched between two roads. There is road noise and car horn noise, but it is not a big problem. The sound of landing planes does have an impact, but it‚Äôs not a big problem. The amazing thing is that I am a person who particularly needs quietness when sleeping. I don‚Äôt need to wear earplugs at night. There are few planes at night. The occasional plane sound turns into white noise to help me sleep! What's more, the hotel is actually under the flight path of a nearby military helicopter. I'm really speechless, but it's not a big problem. The helicopters only fly a few times during the day.
The most critical thing to criticize is the cleanliness of the toilet. The underside of the toilet seat in the room I stayed in became a sanitary dead zone. The urine stains were really annoying, so I cleaned them myself. Hope the hotel takes note.

Environment: Although the terrace faces the airport, it is not very noisy when the door is closed. The landscape is very good, and every house should have a terrace.

The hotel is across the road from the beach.

Service: When someone is brought into the room, pay attention to the path, there are several buildings. There's someone singing in the hotel lobby restaurant, it's very high-end

Summary: At this price, first-class

The hotel has a beautiful environment and is hygienic and clean. There are many varieties of breakfast and the ingredients are fresh.

They are all very clean. In short, I feel relaxed, happy and comfortable staying here. I have stayed here many times. Every time I come to Sanya, I always stay at the Wanjunlan Hotel. Thanks to Ctrip for recommending such a good hotel. I personally think it is better than staying at the Marriott. I have relatively high requirements for hygiene and I can‚Äôt find any faults.

There are 3 swimming pools with different depths, amu*****t facilities for children, a Chinese restaurant, and the beach is just across the road. The lady who cleans the guest rooms is very enthusiastic and takes the initiative to ask me when she sees me. Is there anything that needs to be changed in the room? The ladies in the Chinese restaurant are also very nice and offer children's chairs when the children are eating. Disadvantages: 1. Guests who come to check in are not familiar with the hotel's building number. It is recommended to provide a map when the room card is issued, or print it on the back of the cover outside the room card. 2. It is recommended that the takeaway cabinet be placed in the corner of the lobby. , if you want to pick it up, you have to walk downhill. Although it is not far away for 2 minutes, the experience is not good. 3. The staff in the hotel lobby should stand up and greet you with gifts. Generally speaking, it is quite good. The convenience store recommends a wider variety. The store needs to be optimized.

msg:We arrived at the hotel early in the morning due to flight delays. The hotel service is quite satisfactory, there is no enthusiasm at all. The room I was given was on the floor of the lobby, and it was so humid that it couldn't be more humid. The quilt didn't feel dry to the touch, and the metal parts of the hangers were all embroidered. There was always a musty smell in the air, and there was a dehumidifier in the room, which turned out to be full within a few hours. Definitely won't live a second time.
Because it was too late and the children were too sleepy, they didn't propose to change rooms. Fortunately, I only slept for one night, because the flight was only booked for the evening, and I packed up and prepared to leave at dawn.
We didn't use the cooling supplements, marshmallows, travel photos, Starbucks coupons, etc. in the order, and no one reminded us. When I checked in, I saw the guest next to me operate under the prompt of the staff. When checking out, I also saw that some guests took it away.
In fact, the scale and supporting facilities of the hotel are all okay, but the maintenance is not in place.
Another: The swimming pool is not bad, and the staff by the pool are quite nice.

msg:This time I traveled to Sanya and chose to stay at Narada Sanya Bay Guest House. In Hainan, where the blue sea and blue sky meet the tropical style, it is considered an old-fashioned star hotel in Sanya. It is located on the golden coastline of Sanya's famous scenic spot "Coconut Dream Corridor", facing the sea and enjoying the panoramic view of Sanya Bay.
       The mini room is cost-effective, the room is simple and hygienic, and the floor-to-ceiling sliding glass can overlook Sanya Phoenix Airport.

[Scenic area around, convenient transportation]
1. About 4 kilometers from the airport, only 15 minutes by car
2. About 4 kilometers away from West Island, only 15 minutes by car
3. It is about 6 kilometers away from Tianya Haijiao, only 20 minutes by car
4. It is about 12 kilometers away from Sanya Bay Wedding Photography Base, and it only takes 40 minutes by car

I especially like the rectangular swimming pool and the wooden floor of the room. The water quality is also very clean. It is very close to the airport but not noisy.

msg:I want to say that I picked up a treasure during my trip to Sanya this time. This five-star hotel that looks like a "state-owned unit" is very suitable for me. Especially 300 a night for a single room with meals, it's not too cost-effective.
First of all, the location is at the seaside of Tianya District, where taxis cost more than ten yuan from the airport. This beach should have been renovated, with a long coastline and clean sand. There were no messy soliciting projects on the beach the night I arrived. I only saw a motorcycle. boat. There are also public deck chairs on the public beach suitable for watching the sunset in the evening. The lobby is amazing, it takes people to Phuket in a second, and the sea is not inferior to Patong. It takes more than ten minutes to walk nearby to eat very authentic Qingbuliang and a noodle shop that locals go to. It costs a few dollars to take a taxi, and you can eat more. You don‚Äôt have to worry about living in Yalong Bay or the more remote Haitang Bay. There is nothing to eat and you can eat instant noodles in the hotel.
The facilities are very comprehensive, meeting all the requirements of a five-star hotel, and even exceeding most of them. I arrived in the evening, and the swimming pool was still very lively. I asked the lifeguard that it could be open until 10:00 in the evening, and the water temperature of the constant temperature swimming pool was just right. There is also a buffet barbecue hot pot at night, 150 per person, I checked the reviews the next day and it can be reduced to 100 per person for early booking. The point is that the taste is delicious, and the skewers and oysters are at the upper-middle level, except that the oysters are a bit slow. In addition, you can also eat several local flavor pastries in Hainan. There is also the lazy accompaniment of the singer.
Although the room is small, it has a balcony facing the airport. Watching the planes take off and land and the large area of ‚Äã‚Äãtropical greenery really feels like a vacation. I also thoughtfully gave earplugs and put them on so I couldn't hear the planes taking off and landing at all.
The only complaint is the service. The service staff here have no sense of service at all, which must be a common problem in the domestic hotel industry. No one intends to stay in the hotel for a long time, and there is no tip, so most of the service staff just wait to die, and don't expect to provide any warm service. What I often encounter is that I stare at you in surprise when I first come up, and then I am a little impatient. This is especially common in this hotel, I was even educated by the lifeguard by the pool that we don't provide water here, next time you go to the room and bring it yourself. I feel like I am a tenant who rents the landlord's room here, so I can't accept this kind of service haha.
Hygiene is also a shortcoming. I took photos of mirrors and window screens. I don‚Äôt need to think about problems that cannot be seen with the eyes when I see them at a glance. I don‚Äôt care about them so much. But the management can see these photos to understand that your cleaning must be perfunctory. As for how to perfunctory everyone, we can only save character. Although it is a beggar's room of 300 yuan, there is no harm in cleaning it carefully.
But on the whole, the flaws are not concealed, and I think I may come again next time.

msg:When I came to the hotel for the first time, it still felt like a vacation in Southeast Asia.
After checking in, I found that this hotel has a lot of problems, and there should be no chance to experience it again.
1. The room facilities are relatively simple, and the toiletries are poor. The minibar was empty although there was a price list for the items. It may be related to the reception team guests. I booked this hotel because I wanted to go to the West Island this time, and the price is not cheap in the early 1000s.
2. It is commendable that the front desk handles on-boarding very quickly.
3. The hotel offers gifts, such as Starbucks buy one get one free, this should be done by the hotel itself, and some paper cups with the Starbucks logo were made, which really surprised me. The price list is shown in the picture below, definitely not Starbucks!
4. The breakfast is difficult to explain in a word, not to mention the variety of varieties, and the replenishment is very slow. In addition, when we entered the restaurant at 8:30, there was no seat, and the experience was extremely poor. There was no staff to keep order.
5. The hotel swimming pool is well received. It has a constant temperature. It may be the relationship between the parent-child hotel and the children are afraid of catching cold.
6. In addition, the hotel elevator does not need to swipe the card to go upstairs, which makes me worry about safety issues.
7. Someone put a Band-Aid on the smoke alarm on the top of the bedroom in the room. No matter what the reason is, the customer service depar**ent of the hotel did not find this problem during cleaning. It was a mistake!

There are two shortcomings. One is that the "refrigerator" in the room is not a refrigerator. According to the introduction of the hotel customer service, it can only keep fresh and cannot be cooled. After all, Sanya is so hot, a refrigerator is still needed to cool it down. The second is that the toiletries include body wash and shampoo, but there is no conditioner, and I hope it can be increased.

msg:This is the second time I stayed in a hotel. It was 4 years ago since the last time. I thought the services could keep up. This time I wanted to bring my baby. It is close to the airport and it is more convenient, so I chose to stay here for two days. Nothing has changed in the hotel, the wooden floor of the room, many of the room doors are moldy, there are no guide signs in the huge hotel room, and there is no waiter to guide you. After checking in at the front desk, you tell me where to go and find the room by yourself, completely on your own Groping, the corridor is long and clean, because it is open, facing the garden, the ground is relatively damp, empty, there is no waiter, I feel very cautious, I guess no one will find any accidents in the corridor, especially the children's paradise The waiter here is really the most "excellent". There has never been a polite word or a greeting. Isn't this hardware? I kept my face down the whole time, sat and played with my mobile phone by myself, just talked, put the shoes outside and then come in, come here to sign, I'm leaving get off work, at least I can't say "hello" or "please", like It's as if I owe her money, it's too much! There is one thing to say, the waiters in the pool and the hotel welcome are good, they will take the initiative to help customers, other than that, tsk tsk, I will not choose this hotel again in the future. In addition to being close to the airport and cheap, there are no advantages. The location is relatively remote. It is far away from downtown, duty-free shops, and the first market. I suggest that since you choose to take a vacation and spend so much on air tickets, just go for it. You should choose a better hotel and enjoy life!

Disadvantages: The facilities are very old, very old, the bedding is not very hygienic, and there are bugs. If you mind, don't stay.
The service is not good, and they will not take the initiative to help guests, which does not match the five-star hotel at all.

And then gave us an upgrade to the elegant sea view room. The room is facing the sea. Really enjoyed the feeling for kids living in the outback. Cozy and comfortable. And the breakfast buffet also has many dishes. Suitable for everyone to choose. There is also a wide variety of dinner buffets. Out of the hotel is the sea. Although the water in Sanya Bay is not particularly clear, the location of the hotel is very convenient. Also very close to the airport. Prices and services are very good. Xiaowu Haihui and other hotel service staff encountered were very good. Falling in love with Sanya starts from the Sanya Guest House.

It is suggested that the hotel will be upgraded to another room after Ctrip has dealt with it. Thank you for this. But the bathtub in the new room has no way to drain water, which is also a hardware problem. What I want to emphasize most is that many of the foods provided in the breakfast are halal. Why do I, a non-Muslim, provide me with halal food? Of course, there are non-halal food in the restaurant, but very few, even less than half.

When we entered the hotel, the car we rented slipped, and we were in a dilemma for a while. The security guard came to direct the first time, helped us reverse the car and re-enter.
When checking in, my daughter started to sleep, and the staff immediately used the check-out window to help us check in.
Parent-child projects: There is a swimming pool bubble battle every afternoon, three swimming pools meet different needs, and the children's paradise is next to the swimming pool.
Hardware: Stayed in an apar**ent suite, the room design is reasonable and hygienic
Sea view: Because I live on the 3rd floor, I can only see a line of sky, but it is also across the road from the beach, which is very convenient.

It is very convenient to walk and exercise with the sea breeze in the morning and evening. You can also book a couple package.
The service is very good, the front desk, the bag, the manager Mao Mao Dong Liehan Zhang is very enthusiastic, the check-in is also very fast, the breakfast has many varieties, the restaurant Yang Mengxin, Wang Tangwei, Chen Yanni have thoughtful service, the dishes are delicious, especially Chen Yanni is very enthusiastic to introduce us to the surrounding attractions . It only takes 20 minutes to drive to Nanshan. I went to Nanshan and came back to have afternoon tea in the lobby bar. Huang Yunfei also gave us a marshmallow. The service has nothing to say. I would recommend friends to stay here. I will choose this hotel when I come to Sanya again üè®

The water was dirty and mosquitoes were biting in the sand. There are a lot of things that don't work in a hotel. The room is small. The cleaner in front of me moved my suitcase off the floor and scratched it a bit. The breakfast was good, but I can't say it was great. For the same money, I moved to Yalong Bay, which has great big rooms and very clear sea. Seeing the difference, I realized that staying at this hotel for three days is a waste of time

Low-key and high-end, not just a background issue!

They were very service-minded and very polite! The welcome fruit and afternoon tea are very nice. Sitting on the balcony enjoying the sea view, eating snacks and chatting, the fatigue of travel has been forgotten. The hotel's catering is also very good. After first contacting the Chinese restaurant to understand the relevant information, I went downstairs to eat with my friends. There are many kinds of dishes and the taste is also very good. Compared with the Hyatt Place in the city center, I think it has the best price/performance ratio. The lobby of the hotel is decorated in a generous style, a bit like St. Regis.

The hotel is not too big and very clean. The garden workers are very diligent. The hotel is beautifully furnished. The building is magnificent and the sea view is beautiful. excellent service. A little brother took the initiative to take the luggage to the room. The eldest sister of the children's playground is serious and responsible. The eldest brother watching the swimming pool is also very responsible. The staff is well-trained and polite.
This hotel is very quiet, not chaotic or noisy, suitable for the elderly, a road away from the beach, you can watch the invincible sunset of Sanya Bay. The noodles cooked for breakfast are delicious.
In short, I think it is suitable to stay for a few days in the nearby attractions. You can go shopping in the nearby Fenghuang Town. It's a pity that I didn't have time this time.

Room hygiene is good, sitting on the balcony to watch the sea view sunrise is so beautiful. Secondly the service is great. When the car arrived at the door, the service boy immediately helped to push the luggage with the car, and the young lady who checked in also upgraded the sea-view room for free. The third is breakfast great. Exchange Ctrip points for two free breakfasts, rich in content, both Chinese and Western. It is very pleasant to have breakfast and coffee in the courtyard with the sea breeze. A cost-effective experience, and stay here next time.

msg:The old man in his family returned to Beijing from Sanya, and was unable to board the plane at the airport because of the Beijing Healthbao pop-up window, so he found this hotel near the airport temporarily. When I saw that there was a free shuttle when I booked, I called the front desk to book a car. The front desk said that the shuttle must be reserved one day in advance, because the old man is 85 years old and asked to take care of it. I am very grateful to the manager on duty, and I immediately contacted the driver before he got off work. , I arranged to go to the airport to pick up the old man to the hotel. The old man is very satisfied with the hotel's environment and breakfast. The next day, the hotel arranged a car for a nucleic acid test. On the morning of the third day, I took the old man to see Guanyin of the South China Sea. Because it was a 6:00 pm flight, we gave a late check-out. In short, although I did not return to Beijing on time due to an accident, the service I enjoyed at the hotel was an unexpected gain. thanks.

msg:This is a transitional hotel that I will stay in every time I come to Sanya to get on and off the plane. Because I left the shop in August this year due to food safety issues, I gave this shop a bad review and a complaint, and then Ctrip included this one. The assistant manager in the lobby of the hotel called me back. Maybe the assistant manager in the lobby is the biggest official you can meet in this hotel. The end means that I hope I can give them a chance, next time I will give me a better staying experience, and upgrade the experience as compensation. So this time I decided to stay here for the last two nights of my stay in Sanya. Before I checked in, I asked Ctrip's customer service to help me confirm the room upgrade situation and the person in charge who would connect with me, whether it was the one who called me last time. After I actually moved in, I discovered that what they said at the time was actually just high-sounding words, and they didn't want you to stay in at all. So naturally, no one will come to connect with you, just as the last time has never happened. During the entire check-in process, I did not see any person in charge, including the lobby assistant hotel, which seemed to give me an upgraded room type. After I got to the room, I asked the neighboring guests that their room type is the same as my room type, including the upgrade to the room. So, this is just a regular upgrade of a normal check-in. Do not compare the highest-level hotel in Yalong Bay with this hotel, because this hotel has no management at all and no person in charge. So don't have any accidents in the hotel, otherwise no one will come forward to help you solve it except for the lawsuit. Then let‚Äôs talk about the details. On the first day, when I checked in at night, I opened the quilt and there was sand on the bed, so I didn‚Äôt care. I got a red bump, and I called the front desk early in the morning and told me that I had to change the sheets and sheets when I cleaned the room today. However, when I returned to the room after breakfast, I found that my sheets and sheets were still not changed, and there was my child‚Äôs hair. , It was only after my second phone call that the front desk asked the room attendant to change the sheets in front of me. So you don‚Äôt expect this hotel to be 100% one-to-one, and then I came back to the ice problem the next day. The next day I sent me crushed ice like this, and then the restaurant‚Äôs manager Zhao Call me and tell me that because my stomach is sensitive, I suggest that I don‚Äôt use ice cubes. I‚Äôm so funny. I stay in Sanya for no less than 40 nights every year. I have no problem with what I eat and drink every day. I‚Äôm here now. When staying in a hotel, I need to be guided by others. Then I called the front desk and brought me ice cubes. Then this afternoon I took a rest next to the hotel‚Äôs swimming pool. Two kids sat on the deck chairs and slept. The two garden workers in the hotel sprayed pesticides next to me. After a while, they even came to mow the grass, which made a lot of noise. I came here for vacation, not to listen to the noise. I quarreled with their garden workers afterwards. After a while, let‚Äôs not say, I will stay at this hotel in the future, but I will still give a bad review. The reason for staying in this hotel is the lighting of the facilities and equipment of this hotel. I personally think they are all good, but the management of the hotel I can say this The hotel is one of the worst in Sanya. I don‚Äôt want to deny the front-line employees that their service is acceptable, but the hotel‚Äôs management, including the first-level management and middle-level management, is almost invisible.

It is very convenient to get here from the airport for only 20 yuan by taxi.

I didn't experience the breakfast at their home because I was too anxious when I made the reservation. I didn't choose the points exchange and the rights exchange. I will say that it can't be changed later.

Except that the service is not very enthusiastic, I think this hotel is really good.

The swimming pool has a long opening time, and the rental of swimming laps is also reasonable.

Indeed, it is not easy to find food around this hotel, whether it is breakfast or lunch.

msg:I stayed during the National Day. I ordered two sea view rooms and upgraded directly to a three-bedroom and one-living sea view room. My room is on the 8th floor. There is a building on the right side of the line of sight. The sea view is blocked. If the floor is higher, it should be 180 degrees. It's unobstructed. The hotel is located in the most partial location of Sanya Bay, so the room rate is very favorable, but I really like this quiet and comfortable, the beach is not very crowded, but it is really not suitable for swimming in the sea, there is no private beach of the hotel, it is public. Therefore, there is a problem with safety. It is good to take children to dig sand, and there are no people. It feels like it belongs to you. The hotel swimming pool is not big or small, it is clean, there are not enough lounge chairs, and the demand may not be very large. It seemed that we had a private swimming pool in the morning, and there were no people. The service of the hotel, praised a young boy at the front desk on the evening of October 4th, and Mao Guorui, the lobby manager who assisted us in invoicing after we left the store on October 8th, added WeChat to help me get invoices, etc., reply promptly, and answer all questions. , And finally solve all problems properly. All in all are very good. I rented a car during my stay in Sanya, so the location of the hotel is a good thing for me. I got a difficult peace. Thank you Narada and all the staff. See you next time

The environment is good. When Xue Ying introduced the hotel at the front desk, he said a very important thing, that is, our hotel usually receives more government reception, which is more stable than other hotels, and the quality of service can basically keep up. This sentence is very important. After three nights, it was the same.
In particular, the Chinese restaurant‚Äôs score of 4.0 is too low. I personally tested it and the taste is very good. The 238 set menu design dishes match well, and I should add points!

msg:I took my 8-year-old son on vacation. I like the sea. Children like the swimming pool. The swimming pool was a bit small on the holiday next year I decided last year. This time, the hotel with the largest swimming pool area on the west side of Sanya Bay was selected through satellite images. Sure enough, it didn't disappoint me.
Due to the epidemic situation and the off-season, the room type was upgraded to the sea-view twin room on the 4th floor for free. The room area is relatively spacious and has coffee, black tea and mineral water supply. Fortunately, the toiletries are average. I'm used to bringing my own. The bed is very comfortable. My waist and cervical spine are not good. I wear a lumbar pillow and sleep very comfortably. The pillow is also very comfortable and very elastic. I am personally very satisfied with this!
Sanitation is cleaned every day, and the staff is very nice. Although there are very few guests due to the epidemic, I don‚Äôt think the staff are slack because of the small number of guests. The various time points of the daily operations are very accurate, such as when the fountain is turned on and the swimming pool‚Äôs lights are turned off. You can see from the details. Out management is in place. I stayed for a total of 10 days and would not want to leave if it wasn't for the children to start school.
Breakfast is ok. I pay attention to fitness, so I pay attention to my diet. Breakfast is in line with my health standards. It is light and nutritious. There are milk, eggs, vegetables and fruits. After staying for ten days, I will eat one dish twice. I personally think that the cakes and pastries are generally made. My son usually has bread and milk for breakfast. He only ate all kinds of noodles at the hotel once, and then he ate fried rice all the time...
Due to the epidemic, many facilities have been closed, such as a children‚Äôs playground and a buffet barbecue for dinner and performances. The few days I lived there were very clean and it was in line with the requirements of my vacation. The only noise came from unqualified guests, such as a group of children running upstairs until midnight, or drinking and chatting on the balcony.
There is a small village to the north of the hotel, there are supermarkets, pharmacies and small restaurants to solve the needs of life. You can order takeaways for meals, but you have to be prepared for the high prices in Sanya~
All in all, this experience is very good, and I will choose here when I come to Sanya for vacation in the future.

Thanks to the room facilities and sanitation are very good. It is close to the sea and the hotel‚Äôs swimming pool is also very good. There are restaurants and supermarkets nearby.

The hotel is very close to the beach. I left the lobby and crossed the road to the beach. There were no people on the beach and the waves were big. The sea breeze blows along with the beach. It feels really good on vacation.
The next day I checked out late at 2 o'clock. At noon, I went to eat coconut chicken near the hotel. The chicken cooked with coconut water as a soup base was extraordinarily sweet.

It was a bit early to arrive at the hotel, about 12 o'clock. I'll do it later. When I first checked in, the lady at the reception was very good. She told me that there was still a room but it was the end room. I expedited the cleaning and asked me to wait for a while. I left my luggage, went for a walk in the hotel, and came back after playing around. The lady who received me in front of me was no longer at the front desk. Sister, I said that I was here just now. It wasn‚Äôt because of your receptionist who asked me to come over later. She asked me to take my ID card and told me that there was no room. I said that another young lady asked me to come over for a while. Go, there is no room, I asked when it can be done, she said you are too early, the normal check-in is at 3:30, you can come after 3:30! I was very angry at the time. If I was told from the beginning that there was no room and I would not wait at the hotel after 3:30, I could go out with some things, but it did make me wait and there would be a tail room, and then She directly told me that it was no more. She had a very bad attitude. She said that the hotel usually only checks in at 3:30 so early. She asked me to come back at 3:30. Ctrip wrote that she could check in at 3:00. She had a bad attitude. I didn't have a badge, so I asked her name, she told me her name was Li Yin, not sure about the authenticity, then I took the child to the swimming pool to play a bit and came back about two o'clock, the first time I was received My little sister was here again, I went to her again to ask if she had any, she immediately checked in for me, and it was not the end room, I was just not satisfied with this Li Yin, everything else was ok! Can I complain about this Li Yin here?

It's really bad, the service is very poor, I won't take the initiative to say hello, the room given is the top, go to raise an objection and tell me that there is no room, we find the staff member Mao who is familiar with the lobby, and the front desk tells you that you don't know and have no authority. Find yourself and call him, all the services of booking and delivery need to be requested by yourself, otherwise they will not be offered. If you want to go out, you have to find out where and how to go. I said this is a five-star Narada, the service staff said, we have not rated the star!
It is said that it is close to the airport, and it takes 15 to 20 minutes to take a taxi. It is better to live a few minutes further away.
I booked a mini room on the first night. The room is small. The plane is noisy until after 12:00, and it is noisy after 5:00 in the morning. The second night I booked a garden room on the ground floor, with no view and the same noise. Hygiene is mediocre.
Surroundings: If you don't order breakfast, there is nothing around. There is a market within 15 minutes' walk. Ordering breakfast is expensive and not worth it.
Facilities: The gym facilities are only half of the picture, tell you that the swimming pool is not open, the seaside is dangerous and it is not recommended to swim, and the swimsuit is white. If there is a swimming pool in the Asia-Pacific cheap room next door for the temporary transition to the airport, it is a little old.

Our check-in time was relatively early, it was less than 11 o'clock. The room has not been sorted out yet, and the front desk staff also helped to upgrade the ocean view room on the 6th floor. Although this hotel has been opened for a long time, it is really well maintained. The lobby to the restaurant are beautiful. The mattresses in the rooms are more comfortable, and the quilt is also a thinner comforter, without dampness. Three outdoor swimming pools meet the needs of guests of different ages. For those who bring children to stay in the summer vacation, the hotel also arranges daily different parent-child food making classes for free, so the children can enjoy it. During the stay, in addition to the swimming lap charge in the swimming pool, it is a mess. When you go for ten yuan a time, children have to go two or three times a day. Compared with other hotels, they are provided for free. I really can't fault it in other aspects. Next time I go to Sanya, I must live here again. Also recommend to friends

But when you enter the treasure hotel, it is thousands or two thousand and one night, but the real treasure hotel I think is Narada, the value for money is too suitable for family trips. First of all, the customer service is enthusiastic, the buffet does not step on thunder, and you can also check out late. The hotel is very close to the sea and the beach üèñÔ∏è across the road. The pool area of the key hotel is very large, divided between children and adults. It‚Äôs plain and clear, and there are bubble parties. Don‚Äôt have fun with your children. Taking your children to Sanya is nothing more than a beach swimming pool. Narada Guest House can satisfy the price and surpass many surrounding hotels. This is the real thing. Treasure Hotel, it‚Äôs very cost-effective. The most important thing for a family when traveling is sanitation, the smell of mosquitoes in the room, or the smell of peculiar smells, etc. After all, I pay attention to these when I bring children. As a mother, I also care about it, but it is often too cheap A room with a hundred yuan will be like this, let alone provide you with ice cubes, welcome fruit and travel photography and other services. The hotel is also very big. I originally planned to stay for one day and turn it into two days. If not for the following activities, I think I will stay in Narada. Next time I come to Sanya, I will definitely come to Narada Guest House first, because he has everything the child needs, and the price-performance ratio is too suitable üíØ

Everything is so familiar, but everything is new. Unexpectedly, before we said anything, Li Yao at the front desk took the initiative to call to give us a birthday cake, and when we were out that day, the front desk manager kept in touch with the phone for fear that the cake would break until we came back. , The cake was sent up. This is one of the novelties. The second new idea is that we have not eaten in the Chinese restaurant here before, but after having eaten it, we regretted that we should have come long ago! ! Compared to other hotels, even outside restaurants, the prices here are really not expensive, and what's more rare is that the taste is pretty good. Come to Sanya in the future, it is definitely a good place to stay in the first choice! ! !

msg:The first stop hotel in Sanya, the rooms are comfortable and quiet, parent-child activities are rich, and the service attitude is enthusiastic. After staying for a day, I decided to continue staying. The little bell at the front desk and Xiao Li perfectly helped us to complete the problem of staying. Gao Hotel, if there is a chance, I would recommend it to relatives and friends to stay.

I booked 5 rooms on a business trip, and everyone did not sleep well. The restaurant operated by the hotel is also very bad, and the service is too slow, and the waiters are confused and serve the wrong dishes. All in all do not recommend this hotel

msg:A super affordable hotel in Sanya Bay. I bought a family second suite. The front desk was upgraded to a super sea view suite. The view of the sea is super large, and the swimming pool downstairs is unobstructed... There are three swimming pools, the deep water area and the children‚Äôs area are suitable for everyone to choose. Launch. The beach is just across the road. It can be said that it takes only 1 minute from the hotel to the beach. The Chinese restaurant is affordable and the dishes are good. The hotel‚Äôs BBQ is 158 yuan per person, which is a great value in Sanya hotels. At first, I only decided to try it out for one day. Because I was satisfied in all aspects, I continued to stay for another week. It happened that my friends at home also brought their children out to play, so I strongly recommended this hotel. Maybe the hotel‚Äôs occupancy rate was too high on the first day and the room was not upgraded. My friend was not satisfied after staying in, so I would negotiate with Miss Lin at the front desk. Upgrade the room. After listening to me, she immediately agreed to upgrade the room the next day. My friend was very happy and I was also very satisfied. I felt that there was nothing wrong with choosing this hotel for my friend. Thank you Miss Lin!

I have to come twice a year. This time I also met one A gentle and beautiful lady at the front desk can feel her smile through the mask. She arranged everything for you very intimately. She secretly took a look at the name badge. Miss Xue Ying hopes to see you again next time. It‚Äôs worth it. One thing to mention is her family‚Äôs swimming pool, three swimming pools, children, adults who can‚Äôt swim, and swimming enthusiasts. The depth of each swimming pool is different. The deepest swimming pool is the kind of infinity pool that is rare to find in Sanya. Breakfast is ok, normal five-star hotel breakfast, but this time I didn‚Äôt choose to set it up.. The super beautiful sea view in the room will tell you by looking at the picture üëç

People who smoke can't stop smoking, right? Does smoking have to go to the main road? Also... the swimming pool was blasted so early... Anyway, the hotel is worth about 200, but it is not worth it if it is expensive...

But sister Xiao Zhong gave a free upgrade to the sea view room. I originally booked it for two days and thought it was good. I wanted to stay for another night but I was told that the price of the current room was increased. It is a bit annoying to not be able to use the previous price. Finally I decided to check out and live in the hotel next door. There are all big and small hotels next to each other. The most important thing is the place to live. This saves money! It‚Äôs not bad, Sister Zhong is good, but the price has increased, and she doesn‚Äôt have the right to give us the original price.

The children‚Äôs pool is very shallow and suitable for children to play. It is very convenient to go out to the beach of Sanya Bay. Although the environment is older than Sofitel Leeman, the facilities are not so good, but the price is There. Overall very satisfied, I highly recommend this hotel. Much better than Haitang Bay, Haitang Bay is really too biased, and the beach is not fun
