msg:A grand ole dame but certainly one that has seen better times.  Location is great with easy connectivity to the Metro and IFC next door, with a supermarket and lots of food and retail options.

The room was large and had a great view of the Shanghai Pearl Tower.

Concierge team was great.  Checking in was chaotic as local Chinese simply ignored the queue and kept trying to cut in.  Needs a staff  to control the process. 

Breakfast area can also be improved in terms of service and food.

My apologies that I could not read his name tag clearly) at the Bell Captain was very attentive and helpful. We had many luggage pieces and he insisted helping me loading them and double checking the destination with the driver. I felt a little embarrassed since he is not a very large man but could handle large luggage bags very quickly before I managed to move a finger.

All staffs I interacted with were very polite, efficient and professional. Honestly I expected this would be another Hyatt, like so many other Hyatts I stayed at in the States but their service level was just at another level. 

I also liked the Cloud 9 bar on the 87th floor. Spectacular view of the city. A very intimate place for drinks.

Room was a good size. Breakfast was great with fresh ingredients every morning. Highly recommend this place as it's so easy to visit all the highlights of Pudong and convenient for Line 14 of Metro which can take you to Xintiandi and YuGardens quickly and cheaply.

msg:The hotel in general is too old, with ruined decoration and furniture not difficult to be found thorough it's public area and hotel room.
The first night had problem with the bathroom which switch for switching the water from faucet to shower head was stuck. Firstly, waited for 10 minutes to have someone on duty to arrived.  Then, he referred the case to technician who came fast enough.  However, he spent like 10 minutes in my room and using the washing basin to clean the switch that he took out.  He explained that the switch was stuck by limescale. The whole process took me like half an hour, and just waited for a shower to relax myself after a long flight.  

The third night, my finger was cut by the broken shower head. I reported the case to the hotel next day morning and requested to change to shower head.  It was not followed up, though there was a duty manager called me and asked about my situation.  

Although most of the staff are sophisticated, the quality of overall hardware is just not there anymore.   Small TV, no coffee making machine, no in room audio system, tiny space for putting toiletries.

I'd choose not to stay there next time, the room can enjoy nice view though.

My partner and I decided to stay here to celebrate our 2-year anniversary. We stayed last year, and it was really good, so we decided to stay here but this time spend extra money on a larger room and for an additional night. Once we had booked I sent an email explaining that we read that the pool was closed due to renovations and would they have any recommendations to make our stay as memorable as the previous year. I was met with a reply stating that the worker was single so didn't understand anniversaries (see photo). 

I had sent many emails asking what we could do as the pool was closed, these emails were not answered (see photo). Once we arrived at the hotel, we saw that the sauna and plunge pool were available for use, but, because we had no idea, we did not bring the clothing to use those facilities.

I wish we had cancelled our booking as it turned out we paid for a weekend to just stay in an expensive room.

We will not be celebrating any other milestone dates at the Grand Hyatt and advise others not to.

msg:The Grand Hyatt is definitely a great and somehow economic choice to experience one of the three high towers of Shanghai. This unfortunately makes it a destination of lot’s of tourists and getting kind of crowded. - We had some disappointing experience 15 Minutes before our checkout time: We got a call to remind us of checkout time getting close and somehow making us understand that being even some minutes late, would  cost us a full booking an additional day. This ruined the complete positiv experience.

Long queue in lobby but staff asks us if we are global member so that she can guide us to vip counter to avoid long queue. We use few minutes to check in instead of 30 mins or more. Location is good but too crowded downstairs in front of the hotel. People were stayed there to take picture from sunrise until 11pm, a bit annoying. Foods from restaurants (breakfast) were tastes bad (my opinion only), even they have many selections. 

Overall still ok for staying there.

I was disturbed with repeated phone calls and knocks on the door asking me to checkout or extend .. which was really annoying ... if it wasn't for the medical procedure and the needed recovery, I would have left for sure

msg:This has traditionally been my go-to hotel for a nice staycation. I stayed for CNY and my Birthday, and it's the first time the experience has been less than stellar.

I think they were inundated with tourist for CNY, so I can't really fault them for that. Everytime I went down, the lobby was always crowded with people in line. Normally the manager/host has some friendly banter, but they were too busy.

Housekeeping as always was wonderful!

Had the buffet dinner on my birthday. The price was seemingly much more expensive than normal. They also only gave 1/2 lobster. Other hotel buffets don't limit the number as long as you eat them. The selection of food also seemed more limited than what it was last time I was there (or maybe just seemed that way due to the price). So the food was good, but not the value.

After 4 days there, I asked for a late check out.  I was just simply told 'no'. I know it's a courtesy of the hotel to do, but it's the first time there which I didn't get one and where I just got a straight no. No reason, not asking what time, or anything. Once again, I know they are probably extra busy with CNY travelers.

Anyway, I'll still go back. Like I said, the service was less than stellar, but still overall good. Though I may skip the buffet dinner next time.

msg:The worst experience in a Hyatt hotel.

Shenzhen and Guangzhou Grand Hyatt are much better than Shanghai one.
Front desk ladies treat you **** because you are a guest with an Asian face. Never expected that I would have to pay 1.5 times my hotel fee for deposit? 

How much would the minibar cost anyway… the fact that they are charging me extra like this and that I can negotiate the price down is just not 5-star standard.

What happened to Jinmao Hyatt?
We left with the greatest disappointment to this beautiful city and architecture because of their utmost ****tiest service.

Please do better.

So let me give Jinmao Hyatt a list of concerns for their benefit:
1. Please try educating your front desk ladies how to treat customers.
2. Please make sure that people are actually taking calls at 8AM. It is not too early is it?
3. Why would you not provide phone charger cords for guests when requested? The fact that these staffs have advertised third-party rentable phone banks is outrageous… is it in your playbook to relay duties like this? 
4. A five-star hotel that doesn’t have a staff who speaks proper English is simply not prepared for foreigner guests…

msg:My wife and I were very excited about this stay in this iconic hotel for a short staycation in the city. Not too expensive, but we wanted to treat ourselves for a stay out of our daily stresses. In the end, nothing memorable really apart from the JinMao tower itself. 

1) Very poor English level of service staff at restaurant, spa area and rooftop bar, which for a brand like Grand Hyatt in the primest of spots in Shanghai is totally unacceptable.

2) Had booked a standard room king size bed, got free upgraded at check in to river view, which I thought was nice but what the receptionist didn’t mention was that the bedding was downgraded to queen size. As a couple, we like king size but at no point was this checked. Made the free upgrade feel like a cheating exercise, convenient for the hotel but not with guest’s preferences in mind. 

3) Food at the evening buffet was surprisingly very average, nothing special at all, which for a ticket of above 550 RMB per person is frankly a steal and not at all at the level of what one would expect from a hotel of this class in a first tier city like Shanghai. Not very nice either to be bothered by staff setting up mini jams for breakfast on the tables at 21h45 (buffet closes at 22h00) whilst people were still having dinner. This shows again no genuine attention to the quality of experience of the restaurant’s patrons. 

4) my wife tried the massage, masseuse was stressed out for unknown reasons and it could be felt through the massage itself 

5) rooms are nice and big, but no coffee machine (hello??? We are in 2023, 5star brand, and only nescafe’ type of coffee? I thought it was a joke! The minibar offer was also a joke, no snacks let alone no wine and not even enough water to drink (just two bottles of 500ml per person). 

In conclusion, overall unfortunately, another hotel, another 5star brand, sacrificed over poor management or lack thereof, certainly quite a lot of Grand Hyatt standards not implemented and staff without any genuine hospitality passion to make one feel special… with one exception: the checkout. A great surprise to leave just by giving the key to a receptionist who asked whether we wanted a bill or not.

Your breakfast for the price was also poor and other than the view id recommend going outside for breakfast.
 i think paying an extra 200RMB for the landmark across the road is far better value.

We also went to the swimming pool at night, but need reservations due to the covid situation. After a reservation we discovered that the swimming hat was mandatory. They can sale one for 120rmb.

Breakfast had a large choice in Chinese style but a bit disappointed for Western style with less variety.

Check in time is 3p, which to me is late since most hotels we patronize are 2p. Our room wasn’t ready until almost 7p due to it being a holiday and many people checking in. They upgraded us and because I asked, added breakfast to our stay. The room was on the 80th floor and was very clean, but a little dated. It had a bath tub which was great for our son. We had a stunning night view of the Bund. This location has a great gym, indoor swimming pool, and many restaurants to choose from, so it offers a lot at a high price.

The good:

- The view from the pricier river-view room was nice.

- Breakfast was fine, but with limited choices

The bad:

- Taxis are not allowed to drive to the hotel entrance and no staff available to help. Had to carry our suitcases from the curb into the lobby by ourselves.

- Swimming pool and gym were closed, citing "pandemic control requirements", which seem to be the excuse for everything that is not handled professionally at this hotel. The hotel said that this would have been stated on trip.com (which it wasn't at the time of booking and checking in) and trip.com stated that they were not responsible for solving such issue, since the fees were paid to the hotel directly.

- The rooms are old and lack the basic facilities which one would expect from a 5-star hotel such as a coffee maker - instead only instant coffee is offered. Also, noise from the hall and neighboring rooms could be heard during the night.

- Staff at the entrance were inefficient and rude when checking health codes upon each return to the hotel.

It’s a pity the bar, gym and pool were closed due to COVID related restrictions. A basic but tasty breakfast was served in-room.

msg:The GRAND HYATT hotel is terrible. 1. Security- the hotel did not stop *********** from sitting in the lobby that solicited people who stayed at the hotel. I felt embarrassed and my daughter was with me, so I was concerned. My wife complained a male pimp approached her as well. He was selling explicit services and cheaper rates at the Conrad Hotel. I was LIVID. 2. The room I stayed in was extremely small. MANDY warned me but the only alternative was to move to a much more expensive room. The room felt like a closet. 3. Safety. The elevator was not safe. There was a loud howling noise getting on and off the elevator. The floor also had water stuck underneath the elevator floor. The elevator made a loud squish noise everytime. 4. The breakfast was terrible. I was ignored by the staff cooking eggs. I had to go an ask for help to recieve scrambled eggs. The bacon was burned and overcooked everday. There was not enough selection of food. For anyone potential customer, please spend your money elsewhere.

Breakfast was also delicious although the spread was limited because of the new SH restriction but nevertheless satisfactory and they make good bread...did i mention the view? This place is really really good !

msg:First of all, thank you so much for the free upgrade!
First 3 nights, I stayed in Grand River View (I think).
But there was a toilet issue so, front desk staff upgraded my room again to Deluxe River View.

Overall cleanness, service, and food were great.
But since I had an issue with toilet, I can only give 4 points for the facility.

Housekeeping staff Ms.朱海玲 was very friendly and kind to support and fulfill my requests.

Breakfast was also amazing - but it was three sections?! And I was sitting far left section that it was too far from the food sections. But it was okay. Waitress helped me getting coffee & maple syrup that I needed.


Cloud 9 bar & restaurant staff was also great!
Ribeye steak (medium rare) was wonderful.
One of staff was very kind and professional to recommend the drink & serve.

Overall, Grand Hyatt was very satisfying!
I can’t wait to visit again next time.

msg:The Grand Hyatt has amazing views of Shanghai and the river. We booked a club room. The breakfast in the club area was really good. The rooms don’t have temperature control in the winter, heat only. Luckily, housekeeping sent a portable AC unit to cool the room down. The pool was disappointingly small. Also, all whirlpool options are separate in the changing rooms, so I couldn’t relax with my husband. I wanted to go to the spa, but the staff either didn’t have the English skills or were too busy talking with each other to help me arrange it. So, I took my services to the Dragonfly spa in the IFC. Overall, the hotel was nice and beautiful. The housekeeping staff and Club staff went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable.

Several employees passed by me not once was I greeted or offered a bottle of water like the people in front and behind me in line.  Turns out I didn’t need to be in this line due to my room type but there was no where that explained that. After an hour in line I was finally at the front but told that the room wasn’t ready after another hour waiting in the club room my room still wasn’t cleaned so I was offered an upgrade. That was a nice surprise and allowed me to continue my plans as it was time for me to meet some friends. 
The room was amazing. Never have I ever stayed in the Presidential Suite and probably won’t be able to in the future. 
But being the type of suite I expected a bit more. 
Lights didn’t turn on or wouldn’t turn off.  The tv wouldn’t turn on and once on wouldn’t change from the greeting screen. There were 4 televisions, 2 were inoperable. And 1 only sometimes worked. 
I asked for help turning the lights on because no matter how hard I tried the living room lights would not come on. I waited  over an hour and no one ever came after 2 more calls. 
The restaurants in the tower mr need reservations but no one ever answers the phone. 
The mini bar was stocked with things I could get free from the club room so why not make those things free for guests ? Save a trip up and down the elevator.

msg:I wouldn’t recommend, usually you expect a much better service for what you are paying. They don’t have enough staff for all guests, it took me more than half hour to check in, I was trying to contact the front desk on the phone and after 10 minutes waiting I just gave up because nobody answered. Even the room service delivered was wrong. Terrible experience.

Thank you to the front desk guy for helping me upgrade, and the customer service was also very thoughtful! The only regret is that I didn't have breakfast.

msg:The hotel is a very old hotel. Let's comment on the hotel with the standards of senior hotel managers! Check-in time was 4:53 pm, and the front desk staff said there were no clean rooms, which was funny. Then I took out my phone and turned on the recording function. The front desk explained to me that I had to wait for more than an hour before I could get a room. Well, Jinmao Grand Hyatt guest room, a river view room needs to be cleaned for 1 hour each? I guess people who have never worked in a hotel don't believe it. Next, in order to avoid being complained (I asked the female employee's name because her black hair blocked her nameplate), the front desk staff sent us to the lounge area of ​​the executive building on the 83rd floor. I don't understand why we were sent to the executive building. It was obviously afternoon tea time, and our group of people could only sit in the sofa and drink a glass of boiled water each. Waiting for a clean room. At more than 10 o'clock the next morning, in the lobby on the 54th floor, my family and I were looking at the outdoor scenery and met two fake monks, one playing the hook and the other playing the master, who greeted me. After I saw it, I immediately notified a white-haired waiter at the front desk, who came forward to drive the fake monks away. The front desk staff was very attentive, well behaved, and provided first-class service. I just felt that big hotels no longer needed security personnel? In short, it felt wrong to stay in this hotel. The front desk staff had a weak sense of service, the administrative building supervisor was a mere formality, the gym hired an out-of-town grandfather to receive guests, and the room attendants did not understand English, so the service was all guessed and gestured.

I just asked the housekeeping department to send toothbrushes and toothpaste and I had to wait for almost 15 minutes. The room design is not new, but it is very clean. The scenery is good, but there should be better ones.
The only complaint I have is that the drainage system in the bathroom is very poor. After only 5 minutes of washing, the water could not be drained out at all and flooded my feet. Otherwise, I'm satisfied.
It was my birthday on the day I checked in, and the hotel also arranged a bouquet and cake. I was really happy. Thanks.

msg:On the day of check-in, the Diplomat Suite was already booked and the package I bought could not be upgraded. Only the room on the 61st floor was available. Fortunately, I met Manager Fang of the VIP Club! I was arranged to stay in the River View Suite on the 84th floor... It is said to be the only twin-bed River View Suite in the hotel. Manager Fang also patiently introduced the various room types of the hotel... The best room type for river view, Bund view, and Oriental Pearl Tower view is the River View King Bed Room (Corner Room), but for the package, it is necessary to downgrade the room type. I still chose the twin bed suite on the 84th floor as I like high floors! The scenery is great! It is because of the shape of the window in the bedroom... The best viewing position of the room is in the living room 🛋️The Oriental Pearl Tower is right next to it! 
Manager Fang of the VIP Club is enthusiastic, enthusiastic, enthusiastic and has excellent professionalism! Very nice! 
The room at Jinmao Grand Hyatt is really good! Classics will never go out of style! ! The so-called "designer hotel" Park Hyatt is simply incomparable. . . I would not have stepped on the thunder at Park Hyatt if I had known earlier. . . I like the style of the bathroom very much~~~ It feels like I'm in the Peninsula in Hong Kong~~~ The old money style is blowing~~~

msg:Overall, I am satisfied.
Advantages: 1. The package includes: room upgrades depending on room availability, and the Diplomat Suite is upgraded for holidays, which is larger than the original suite.
2. The Diplomat Suite has a smart toilet, electric curtains, coffee machine, Bluetooth speakers, etc. The Bluetooth sound effect is great.
3. There is a TV in the living room and the TV in the room can play normally.
4. The kettle, hair dryer, iron and other equipment in the room can be used normally. (I didn't move them and brought them myself)
4. The bathroom is very large, with a double wash basin, makeup mirror, bathtub, shower room, smart toilet (separate, also in the bathroom), and another smart toilet (smart toilet, wash basin with mirror).
5. The entire suite is very large and comfortable.
6. There is an independent cloakroom, with 2 sets of irons, ironing boards, and shoe horns.
7. The bedroom has an independent door, and there are TVs, Bluetooth speakers, coffee tables, sofa stools, small reading tables and stools + reading lamps in the bedroom.
8. There is a separate tea room, equipped with a refrigerator, coffee machine, tea set, tea bags and capsule coffee.
9. The bathroom is equipped with Guerlain toiletries
10. In addition, the service attitude was good when dining at the VIP Club on the 83rd floor (the package also included breakfast on the 54th floor, but I didn't go).
Disadvantages:
1. The suite I booked said that there was a private butler for check-in, but I still had to queue up to check in. When it was my turn to check in, I was asked if I needed to sit upstairs to check in. If I was in line, did I still have to go upstairs to go through the process again?
2. The receptionist stood there smiling and polite, but he also brought children and gave gifts to the little girls of other guests (the room he stayed in was 2588 a night, and he was not short of gifts). We took the initiative to ask "Do I need to queue up to check in?" He didn't even say to sit down.
3. The room facilities are the same as those mentioned in the bad reviews. The air conditioner made a sound all night and the smart toilet splashed chrysanthemums.
4. There is a white bag similar to desiccant in the wash basin in the tea room, with "throw away" written on it
5. Living on the 84th floor, you need to take the elevator twice to the 1st floor to get takeout.
6. There is no guide for placing items in the room, and the hair dryer and slippers are hidden relatively secretly.
7. There is no room service reminder (such as what services can be enjoyed when checking in the room, etc.). The hardware of a 5-star hotel is OK, but the personal experience of soft services needs to be strengthened.

msg:Because the room was cleaned up very slowly, I upgraded to a river view room for an extra 350 yuan! The river view is really good, and the slim waist is right under my feet!

The hotel lobby is on the 54th floor, and you need to take the elevator to transfer.
When I checked in, the front desk was very chaotic and disorderly, and even the passage back to the room was blocked!

First of all, let’s talk about the hotel environment. There are only a few seats in the lobby, but there is garbage and garbage! I told the front desk, and the first thing she did was to take pictures and leave.
Then I said, shouldn’t we clean up first? She came back to clean up again!

The elevator hall, the porch, the entrance of the room and the toilet are of ok grade, very comfortable, and look very grand.
However, the objects in the bedroom part are out of tune with the others, showing their cheapness! ! !
The bed, bedside table, etc. are all very uncomfortable.

Then, the location is very good, after all, it is located in one of the three major items in Shanghai!
There is Zhengda Plaza next to it, you can walk there, and it is a good choice for dining!
There is IFC next to shopping, and various luxury goods counters!
However, it is not recommended to dine upstairs, because it is really just the environment, the dishes are not even as good as the taste of Hong Kong fast food chain brands! 
Most of the halls of the restaurants upstairs can accommodate 5-10 tables, and there is no minimum consumption! The rooms are all around 4k minimum consumption, with a direct view of the river! 

In short, the experience is hard to describe, hard to describe! 
It is also one of the series of hotels that will never come back!

The staff are very polite and generally considerate of the accommodation guests. A few things to complain about are inconsistent with the housing price: 1. The room is small and the bed is small. The double bed room is 1.5 meters wide and cannot accommodate a family of three. 2. The sink in the first picture looks like a convenience hotel, not a luxury hotel. The plug at the bar in the second picture is hidden under the glass plate. Generally, the kettle cord is not long enough and there is no electricity. 3. The faucet in the bathtub did not have a lever to control the shower head. As a result, the shower head could not be used and I could not wash my hair.

It has unobstructed views of the Huangpu River and the Bund. The service staff are very enthusiastic and excellent. During the Spring Festival holiday, when there are many people, I saw them working overtime every day to receive guests. The guest rooms are well-equipped with linens and washing supplies and the mattresses are very comfortable. I couldn't open the door on the 67th floor because I mistakenly stacked two room cards together. Since the front desk phone number at the door of room 6714 could not be reached, I met a hotel staff member on the same floor and asked him for help. His answer was to go to the front desk on the 54th floor to solve the problem. I have to go to the 54th floor with a lot of luggage?

Service: Very poor, no humanistic care. For a hotel with this positioning, the service is not even a little bit better than a hotel of Atour's level.
I was informed in advance that it was my birthday on the day of check-in. I saw in the comment section that everyone was getting cakes for their birthdays. I said I didn’t want the cake because I was afraid of wasting it. Their customer service told me very coldly that there would be no courtesy if I didn’t leave a note on the order. This made people very embarrassed and made me uncomfortable. It's like I'm asking for a gift. The customer service level is terrible.
I booked a pre-sale group purchase, but I did not receive the guest benefits after check-in, and the room was not upgraded. There was a room in the Diplomat Suite that day.
No turndown service, not even the most basic birthday card.
Something was left in the room, and no one informed me the whole day after check-out. I remembered it myself and called to ask before I was informed that it was in the hotel.

msg:The room is actually quite good. As an old hotel with a history of 20 years, the facilities are actually very good. Parking is free. There will be explosion-proof dogs to check the trunk before driving down to the basement. It is very safe. The service and other other things are good. I know it is I was given a bouquet of flowers for my birthday. The only unacceptable thing was that the queue for check-in took a long time. I took the number 133 and asked me to wait in line for check-in after 15:00. There were too many people. I don’t know why the queue was not improved. I was satisfied with the long stay and everything else. The room I was given was 7312. This room type is not bad and the view is very good. Below is the Oriental Pearl Tower and Guojin. It is very beautiful.

When I booked a hotel, I found that I had made the wrong date on my phone. I clicked Cancel in less than a minute, but Ctrip told me that I couldn't cancel. I was told to change it to the next day, so I didn't need to cancel. I called Ctrip countless times but couldn't solve it, and the hotel couldn't solve it. I refused and said that I would have to rebook. When I arrived at the hotel, I said that the room was too old and the facilities were very old. I was willing to pay extra to change to another room. I called the front desk and communicated countless times, but they kept asking me to wait until I couldn't stand it anymore. I went to the front desk and asked them to take care of me. When the management saw me, the disdain and impatience were clearly visible on their faces. I was shocked. I had never seen such five-star hotel service! By the way, the hotel room 🚪 was broken. The socket is out of power

msg:This is the hotel I most want to stay in, because when it was first built, the person in charge of the construction unit invited us to visit the building. At that time, the hotel had already been put into trial operation and the ground floor had not yet been completed. The person in charge of the project first took us to the elevator to the 54th floor. When we were in the elevator, we felt like the pressure on our eardrums when a plane took off. The person in charge said that this is a high-speed elevator and can go up many floors in one second. This is the first time I have been in this elevator. Fast elevator. After getting off the elevator, he showed us the guest room and explained how luxurious the decoration was. He said that a wash basin in the bathroom costs US$30,000. The wash basin looks nothing special now, but when I looked at it at that time, it was the first time I saw a glass wash basin formed in one go. The reason why it was so expensive was that this kind of production technology did not exist in China at that time. After visiting the guest rooms, the person in charge took us to the 88th floor. Then we got off the elevator and climbed four flights of stairs. We reached the 92nd floor and went up to the roof of the Jin Mao Tower. It was very windy and we were trembling with fear. Looking straight at the spherical building in the middle of the Oriental Pearl Tower opposite, the person in charge said that standing here is higher than the ball opposite. This was the tallest skyscraper in the country at that time. At that time, I thought that this was the only chance I would have to visit here, and it would be impossible to live there. Unexpectedly, after retirement, my wife wanted to go to the Oriental Pearl Tower and eat at the Peace Hotel. I thought it would be better to stay in a high-end hotel, so I booked a river view room in the Jinmao Tower. We were also given two breakfasts when we booked the room, and we could look at the Oriental Pearl Tower and Shanghai Tower while eating.

msg:Shanghai really didn’t feel like celebrating the Chinese New Year. I took the elderly to stay in a hotel, and it felt very chaotic from the moment I checked in. From the garage, I had to change three elevators to go to the guest house to check in. It was confusing and there was no one to guide me; it didn’t start until 3 p.m. Of course, most people still have to wait for check-in. In the elevator, there are more than one people who used their room cards to go upstairs to visit. Most of them did not check in in time;
The facilities in the room were old. If I had any problems, I called the guest service center and asked the reservation department to transfer me. The reservation department said they had no right to kick me back to the guest department. When I first checked in, my first reaction was that I would not solve the problem and only wanted to deal with it. Playing football; the coffee machine broke and I had to wait for a long time to find someone to repair it. After the repair, it was very busy to send the capsule again; the glass in the room was very dirty, and the view in the room was very affected no matter how good it was; the so-called VIP Club is also the most expensive among all hotel clubs. The bad ones are that there are far more people than goods, biscuit crumbs are all over the floor, limp and tasteless noodles are completely cut off, cans of Coke, Sprite Vespite, and bottles of juice are up for grabs;
The privacy issue is very serious. The curtain behind the mirror in the women's locker room at the swimming pool is not drawn. There are very small words on the mirror saying that it needs to be opened for cleaning. It is recommended that you close it. I guess everyone who is *****ping next to you will not notice it.
The soundproofing of the room was average. I didn't know that the door opening was not well constructed. At one o'clock in the morning, the neighbor knocked on the door and called someone, which woke us up. There was also an unknown banging sound;
If you want to make a call in the room, you can answer the phone as you please from the concierge, guest suite, and guest service center. It is recommended to scan the QR code at the window to find a robot, which will send you a toothbrush in at least half an hour;
We couldn't squeeze into the Breakfast Club and had to queue downstairs. We were arranged to wait in Rizhen, which is far away. There was a small area with some bread. When I sat down, I was told that I could get it nearby. But when I actually walked over, a white man The male waiter in a gray suit stopped him from taking the food and said that it was the same dishes and bread as those over there. He had to walk from Rizhen to the Chinese food area, pass through the drinks and then go to the Western food all the way to the end. There were so many people and it took a long time to go back and forth. Of course, he won't care if there are too many people to get it. He can stop me, a weak woman, but he can't stop the uncle and aunt who ignore you, right?

There was no service, so he lowered his head and faced me with oil for 3.4 minutes. The boy at the front desk seemed to be named Zhu, and the turndown service was too Perfunctory and not worth it. The only thing that was better was the welcoming ambassador who led my family and I all the way to the queue with a sweet smile. If it weren't for this girl's service, I would give it a low score. It's the only one that warms my heart. The cleaning lady is also very enthusiastic.
Facilities: The room is not big. Maybe I booked it too cheaply. The location is good. Hope to improve service.

The small flaw is that the cotton sheet is too difficult to use.

The room has a little sense of age. It is not actually an old -fashioned high -end hotel for more than 20 years. The layout of wood still likes it. The landscape is a highlight of it. The scenery outside the window is beautiful, and the entire Lu family's mouth is full.

Breakfast is on the 56th floor. On the one hand, it is Chinese -style, and it is necessary to come early. Otherwise, the location of the window is very fast. For the first time, I ate breakfast at such a high degree of breakfast.

It’s very particular and has various requirements, but it’s not very generous. This time I brought my baby to Disneyland and checked in for a three-piece suit. The guy who checked in was very kind. He looked like my brother. He was tall and a bit burly. He looked at our room and said it was of the highest standard. I couldn't upgrade anymore, so I was given a room with a high floor and a good view. It was on the 76th floor. It was my first time to stay at such a high floor. The room was huge and the view was amazing. If you see it in the hotel, remember to give the guy a chicken drumstick. The big dog on the first floor has to go to work every day. Out of curiosity, I chatted with the security guard for a while. He said that the dog’s job is to smell flammable and explosive materials. I asked him, does this happen? He said, my sister has it, hahahahaha.

msg:Booked Diplomat Suite, double VIP room.
I arrived at the hotel after one o'clock in the afternoon on 12/31 and checked in at the Executive Lounge on the 83rd floor. The room was not good, so I waited directly at the Executive Lounge with soft drinks and snacks. After two hours, I still didn't receive a call. I then queued up to ask if the room was good, and finally got into the room around 3:30. At this time, the waiter extended his check-out to four o'clock as an apology.

Because it is a suite, the room is quite large and the view is very good. There was a slight glitch in the electric curtains, so I called for technical maintenance later.

Halfway through taking a shower at night, I discovered that there was no shampoo. The cleaning of this guest room must have been too careless.

I made the reservation several months in advance and mentioned that it was a birthday. I was reminded when I checked in that I still didn't come after 10pm. Other hotels will provide turndown service and fruit delivery, but this suite does not. Finally I couldn't help but call and ask. Finally, a cake was delivered around 11:30 in the evening, and the taste was beyond words. '(Kempinski has red girl greeting cards and birthday cards, and J Hotel Shanghai Center has birthday decorations and cakes) It turns out that the Grand Hyatt's Diplomat Suite has nothing. It was in vain that I made the reservation and made a note so far in advance.

Finally, 12/31 is New Year's Eve. The hotel has New Year's Eve activities for an additional fee, and the activities last until 2 o'clock in the morning. Music can be heard in the room, which is quite noisy.

Generally speaking, compared to the past few years, the suites have not met expectations for New Year's Eve. Rather disappointed.

From the moment I checked in, there were all kinds of queues, no one to guide me, and the whole process was rude. The ordinary room we booked earlier was upgraded to a lake view for free. I was confused when I booked the lake view. The shower in the bathtub was difficult to open and couldn't be opened according to the instructions. The pipe was exposed. The bathing area was hard to describe. The room faced the elevator directly. There were no tissue boxes or trash cans in the room. All soft drinks were available. The price tag and the breakfast variety are average. The only thing is that the room service is very fast and everything you want is delivered to the room in time. The waiter who had afternoon tea had a bad attitude. When we went there, he told us that the afternoon tea set was sold out and asked us to go to the Japanese restaurant next door to have tea. The child saw that there were small cakes in the cabinet and asked if we could order a la carte. The pastry chef said it was OK. , I don’t understand why I rush people to go to a Japanese restaurant when I can order a la carte. The experience is so bad.

msg:When I arrived at the hotel, the doorman was very enthusiastic. Unexpectedly, the bellman who came to pick me up was actually my favorite actor Zheng Zihan. He also thoughtfully called a taxi for my friend in Hong Kong and did not refuse service because my friend did not live here. , there is no air of pretense from the actors to the concierge. Shanghai Jinmao Grand Hyatt is really good at selecting people. Thank you to the concierge and doorman for helping me during my stay. I will come here next time. I hope my favorite actor Zheng Zihan will still be the concierge. Depar**ent work~~~

msg:One of the three-piece Magic City set! I stayed at the Jinmao Grand Hyatt when I came to Shanghai more than ten years ago. At that time, it was really "country bumpkins coming to the city". The scene overlooking the night view of Lujiazui is still vivid in my mind... Although the hotel is quite old, the five-star standard is still there. After breakfast, you can take a lap on the 56th floor and enjoy the beautiful view of today's Magic City! The current price of the hotel is quite cost-effective, so you can try it out.

Transportation is still convenient! The floor is arranged on the 75th floor, and the sanitation is still good. The decoration is a bit old after so many years, and there is nothing we can do about it! Overall it's good. I'll bring my parents to stay next time.

The location is really hard to say. I checked in on the 54th floor and had breakfast in the lobby on 56th floor. The interior and exterior views were very good. The room I checked in was opposite the Shanghai Tower, which happened to be opposite the Yunduo Bookstore. I didn’t need to buy a ticket to experience this stay. High-rise
Children love the bathtub in the room. The water is discharged very quickly. Others are quite satisfactory. The bedding is also good, but I don’t like it very much. It’s too soft. Friends who like soft things don’t worry.

It was said that I had been upgraded to a superior river view room, but the floor was low and the Oriental Pearl Tower was very far away, but I could still see it. I just thought what room would you give me if I didn't upgrade. The overall hygiene is really okay, it has a sense of age, but it does not lose its solemnity. Electric curtains, touch lighting, and robot delivery follow the trend of the times, but why do you still charge for a bathtub cover? Express hotels with bathtubs will give you a cover, and you still charge 35. I don’t know what this manager is thinking. of. Let's talk about breakfast. It's very rich, but I don't know why but I feel like there's nothing to eat. Let's just make omelette. How can I be so unappetizing? By the way, the bedding is okay and very comfortable to sleep on, especially the pillows. I personally think they are the most comfortable I have ever stayed in.

The room is nice and renovated, but the water pressure in the bathroom is weak.
The gym is small and the swimming pool is even smaller. 2 lanes of about 15m.
There are safety guards on duty on both sides.

For one, the customer service staff at the front desk all had expressionless faces. Secondly, some of the restaurants are a bit enthusiastic, but most of them have facial expressions that are too much or too little. In addition, the small dining area is divided into Chinese and Western restaurants, with very unsafe steps and no warning signs. It only takes a few minutes to sit down for a meal. I saw four or five diners almost falling over...what a disappoin**ent. Except for the larger shower water and the advantage of floor sightseeing, the rest of the rooms are unattractive. There is another weird thing about the sightseeing on the 88th floor. The first sightseeing tour allows guests to take photos for free, but it turns out that they have to pay a fee ranging from 100 to 180 to take photos with their tickets. There is no notice in advance. Many foreign guests have very helpless expressions. It is really embarrassing for the Shanghai Television Station. ah. I have stayed in too many five-star hotels, and I cannot praise this one enough. I will not stay here again.

msg:A very satisfying stay. When we checked in, the lady at the front desk gave us an upgraded diplomat suite for free. Knowing that we were booking for an anniversary, they thoughtfully sent us flowers 💐. The view from the room is superb, with a 270-degree view of the living room and a panoramic view of the Huangpu River. I specially set a sunrise 🌄 alarm for the next day. For the first time, I lay on the sofa in the room and watched the sunrise in Shanghai. I was originally worried that the hotel had been built for many years and the facilities might be a little older. After entering the room, I realized that the room should have been renovated. Smart toilets, massage bathtubs, capsule coffee machines, etc. are all available. Breakfast and dinner were both in the Regency Club on the 83rd floor. The view was also great. I was lucky enough to see the sunset of the metropolis here. The waiters are very warm and considerate, and they are indeed the benchmark for first-class luxury hotels.

When we arrived at the hotel with our children, the room had not been cleaned yet, so we told the lady at the front desk that we wanted to stay in a room with a view of the Oriental Pearl Tower. The lady specially reserved a room near the Oriental Pearl Tower for us. Room, let us have a glimpse of the Oriental Pearl Tower and the night view of Shanghai!

I have stayed in many five-star hotels, and I have also stayed in Grand Hyatt abroad, but I have never I have never seen a Grand Hyatt with such a bad environment and such bad service! Your hotel is big and you can be arrogant and look down on others, but if I have money, I can choose not to stay in your hotel! Our fate ends here!
Facilities: The facilities are old, so old that you can’t imagine!
Hygiene: Pretty good!
Environment: See the pictures for yourself! This is the so-called river view room! The view of the river is very limited. . hehe
Service: Not satisfactory! Chinese people have to wait and line up to check in! Foreigners don’t have to queue up to apply, and there is a dedicated service desk! What year is it? Still engaging in discrimination in China?
Service: A ******* took two children, a boy and a girl, to go swimming. The boy went to the changing room and had not come out for a long time. He wanted to ask the male staff next to him to help him go in and shout. The male staff ignored him and said After making fun of him, he didn’t go in to help check on the child’s condition!

The hygiene is average, the hardware facilities are old, the appearance looks quite high-end, the rooms are too average, and the front desk is also self-centered. I didn’t even see the Oriental Pearl Tower in the arranged room. When I checked in I told the front desk that we could arrange to take photos of the Oriental Pearl Tower. The front desk said that it had already been arranged. I was drunk. I brought my daughter here just to take pictures of the night view of the Oriental Pearl Tower. I couldn’t even see the Oriental Pearl Tower. The price/performance ratio was not high. This was my first stay and my last stay.

The hotel is in Jinmao Tower, and the guest rooms are all on high floors, with surrounding buildings and river views. There is convenient vehicle access downstairs, and you can walk to the Oriental Pearl Tower, Art Museum, Shanghai Convention Center, China International Finance and other shopping and attractions. If you want to go to the Bund conveniently, you can take the underground tunnel for 50 yuan and get to Nanjing Road on the Bund in a few minutes. The service is very attentive. They gave me a large box of mooncakes during the Mid-Autumn Festival. They tasted great and were very surprising and sincere. Takeout and storage are very convenient. The hotel facilities are simple, of good quality and very hygienic. Very cost-effective, five-star recommendation!

Only today did I know that your hotel is really a big cheater, and it also deceives international friends. Obviously, he had a deposit slip in his hand and paid 2,000 yuan in cash. And after signing the signature, the hotel staff actually said that they did not see the deposit, and refused to handle the deposit refund procedure for various reasons. The guest needs to explain what day, month and time he checked in. Don't you **? Why is a deposit receipt issued when no deposit is collected? Later, I contacted local friends in Shanghai to communicate in Shanghainese, and my attitude immediately changed drastically. What does it mean? I would like to ask the leader of the hotel to give me an explanation and verify whether what I said is true. I am willing to take legal responsibility for what I said. Also: When the guest went out to play, he repeatedly told the staff to clean the room, but when he came back at night, he found that it had not been touched at all.

msg:I chose to stay at the Jinmao Grand Hyatt Hotel on my birthday. It is located on the 54th floor and above of the Jinmao Tower. It is a landmark building in Shanghai and one of the three-piece suites in Shanghai. It is very historical. The room layout is relatively orderly, the facilities are not as old as the hotel, and overall it is more elegant. The scenery of the hotel is very good, but unfortunately the Diplomat Suite only faces Pudong and is on the back side of the Bund. There is little view of the Bund and the river. The suite we stayed in 8501 is also the highest suite. The catering depar**ent also sent a birthday cake, thank you very much. The only shortcoming is the hotel service, especially the front desk and customer service depar**ent. The overall situation is very chaotic, and the communication between each other is extremely inefficient. It takes several hours to handle one thing. The service attitude of the catering depar**ent is very good and polite, which is the guest house. The meals were a little short, and some major dishes that should be included in the main meal were missing. It is not recommended to go to the Grand Hotel for breakfast. The breakfast restaurant downstairs is more abundant. It's best to give the two managers a thumbs up. Manager Sun and Manager Xu's handling efficiency and attitude are very good.

Only six bottles of bottled water for making coffee were free. During our stay there, we basically spent the whole time except asking for directions and talking to the hotel. The waiter had no communication.
The buffet on the 56th floor was very poor, not delicious at all. I spent more than 500 for lunch, and I didn’t see anything like the Aolong that was advertised. The breakfast buffet is also very average.

Hold it with one hand? So why is it not like this with foreigners? What age is this? It’s still like this. Many people come here just to see the Oriental Pearl Tower, but in fact the windows are dirty and blocked. The windows are so small that you can’t see anything at all. It’s better to find a viewing spot. View restaurant and drink shop

In terms of service: when you enter the lobby at night, a doorman will ask you if you need to take your luggage: go to the front desk to check in, and a beautiful and always smiling lady will take the initiative to help you upgrade to a suite: have breakfast, and a waiter will warmly greet you and bring you in seat.
Hygiene and equipment: After entering the room, I found that it was not outdated as mentioned in the reviews, but due to the decoration style. The mirror in the room actually tested the hygiene standards. The toilet, lights, and curtains are all electronically controlled and fully equipped.
The most surprising thing is that in the room and during breakfast, you can have a panoramic view of the Oriental Pearl Tower and the night view of Shanghai. The breakfast varieties are divided into Chinese and Western styles, and are rich in different regions. I feel that the taste is average, but my personal taste may be different.
Transportation: Located in the center of Shanghai, next to the subway, it is convenient to go anywhere.
This trip to Shanghai made me feel that it was very worthwhile, but I was in a hurry and did not fully experience and enjoy more of the hotel's services.
Will recommend to friends around me

msg:Let’s talk about the advantages first: needless to say the geographical location, convenient transportation, and very convenient to go anywhere. You can see the Bund from the room, which makes you feel happy. The hotel facilities are not particularly new, but they are well maintained, very clean and tidy, and the bed is very comfortable, so I slept well. These can all be given full marks.
Let’s talk about the shortcomings: it may be that the passenger flow is relatively large during the National Day holiday. The cooperation between the front desk on the first floor and the front desk on the 54th floor can be said to be very poor. Because I decided to book this hotel on the spur of the moment, my initial reservation for this hotel on other platforms was not confirmed by the hotel in time. At that time, I was already at the front desk on the first floor early in the morning. Logically speaking, the hotel staff does not care whether they are on the first floor or fifty. The fourth floor should guide and help guests confirm their orders in a timely manner or make reservations on another platform. But the front desk on the first floor only said to me impatiently: I don't know, you have to wait. Fortunately, Ctrip was very helpful. I re-booked on Ctrip and the order was confirmed immediately.
Next is the check-in process. I can understand why you can't check in if there is no room available early in the morning. But the front desk couldn't even tell me the specific check-in time. It only said that check-in would start at 1:45 or 2:00 pm. This is okay, after a night of flying without food or sleep, I wandered outside for more than five hours and then returned to the 54th floor to check in. However, the front desk told me that I had to go to the first floor to get a ticket. Is this how five-star hotels torment their guests? Why not just get the sorting coupon on the 54th floor? So I ran to the first floor to get the sorting coupon and successfully got No. 35. As a result, no one called at all. When it was my turn to apply, it was actually already over fifty. The front desk upstairs and downstairs can be said to have poor service capabilities. No wonder so many guests are arguing with the front desk.

I sincerely praise their first-class service attitude and five-star praise. When you open the room, the biggest highlight in the guest room is concentrated on the backboard of the bed. On the deep vermilion cracked shading, the achievements of traditional Chinese calligraphy, sculpture and lacquer art are combined, and golden Tang poems are engraved. The traditional charm is ready to come out. It's very attractive to me who loves calligraphy👏 The large wash area is mainly made of silver-white marble, with separate dry and wet spaces, and a shower tower equipped with multiple nozzles. The charming night view outside the bathtub is close at hand, and the sky seems to be within reach. Everything is so natural, and quietly tells the new meaning of luxury that has been carefully invested. The living room has bright colors and the sofa has warm tones. I love it so much 😘Bangbangbang. I was particularly moved by the 🥳 red roses 🌹 flowers in the room 🙏🙏🙏 Special thanks 🙏 Manager Fang Jiajun of Binxuan, he is very friendly, smiling, warm and amiable, and his first-class service attitude is very touching. Give it a big five-star rating... I met the manager Lu Wenchi in the breakfast room and also gave it a five-star rating. All in all, the waiters in the breakfast room are great. Worth looking forward to next time you stay! Thank you🙏...Ctrip Butler customer service has first-class quality service attitude👍👍

msg:It is said that you can upgrade to the Skyline Diplomat Suite, but there is an additional charge of 1,200 for a room available on the same day. Not only that, but the shower leaked all over the floor. I don't know whether it was the wind or thermal expansion and contraction, but there were loud and irregular creaking sounds at night. The phone rang twice at 2:30 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. No one spoke. Didn't sleep well all night. The executive floor used to have a lot of edible items, but this time it was empty. I am a Hyatt member, and the membership price is more expensive than Ctrip. I couldn't sleep the whole night. The hotel I have stayed at more than ten times seems to be really old and the management is no longer good. I am very disappointed.

msg:This hotel really wins because of its location. Because the breakfast is not reflected in the evaluation, it can only be reflected in the service and facilities. The breakfast on the 83rd floor is so anticipated, but it is the first time to experience breakfast in such a luxurious hotel and it is not full. It feels like there are no utensils for breakfast, only omelettes and noodles, and you have to wait in line for a long time. The scene at that time was really interesting. There was no staff to solve the problem. At least I didn't see it or feel it. I still have such a breakfast. After paying, the price is not cheap. The hotel staff called me after checking in to inquire about the check-in situation. After I explained the specific situation, the staff said it was a problem during the National Day holiday. The answer was so professional and they also told me that they would give me a free room upgrade next time I check in. , my God, it’s so cute, I sincerely thank you!

msg:I booked a room in the Grand Hotel but I was hit with a big mistake. The service was terrible. The room was stuffy and had a musty and peculiar smell. I had a sore throat when I came back. I could clearly hear the conversation in the room next door. They were noisy until 1 or 2 o'clock in the middle of the night. They got up again at around 7 o'clock in the morning and continued to make noise. It was like we were staying with strangers for the night and we didn't sleep well! The so-called afternoon tea at the Grand Hotel consists of only one cupcake, some rotten longan, coffee and cheap carbonated drinks. It was very simple food at sunset time, but the breakfast plates were all gone, so we still went to the 56th floor to queue up! Check-in and check-out are very slow. Other hotels have deposit refunds upon check-out, but Jinmao doesn’t know why! I spent hundreds of dollars more to book the Grand Hotel, but this is the kind of trea**ent I received! The service at Jinmao Grand Hyatt is really deteriorating. I won’t go there again!

msg:It should be said that I have a special fate with Jinmao Grand Hyatt because my wedding was held here, so this time I returned to celebrate my second anniversary. Let’s talk about the experience of staying:
1. Geographical location. Excellent, Jinmao Grand Hyatt is located in the upper half of Jinmao Tower, with excellent views, especially the Diplomat Suite we stayed in this time, which has a 180-degree panoramic view, overlooking the entire Century Avenue extending from the Huangpu River to the east.
2. Hotel facilities. Because the hotel has been open for more than 20 years, the decoration of the facilities has a certain sense of age. It can be seen that it was a top-notch work at the turn of the century. The hotel rooms are a fusion of modern style and Chinese culture, and are generally well maintained. .
3. Catering facilities: The hotel is fully equipped with restaurants of various grades including buffet, Chinese food, Western food, and bar. Yin Art Restaurant has a great environment but is expensive. The buffet restaurant for breakfast is large and has a very good view. The breakfast is divided into Chinese and Western areas and is very rich.
4. Executive Lounge: Guests who enjoy the privileges of the Club Club can also go to the Club Club on the 83rd floor to enjoy breakfast, all-day refreshments, snacks and evening drinks. However, the breakfast varieties in the Club Club are relatively small, and the afternoon tea snacks are among the same five-star hotels in Shanghai. The executive lounge of a first-class hotel is also slightly lacking, but the waiters and ladies at the VIP Club are all beautiful and enthusiastic, and the service experience is pretty good.
5. Recreation and sports facilities: The hotel gym has a good environment and a good view. The fitness equipment is complete and well maintained. The swimming pool is beautiful but relatively small and needs to be booked in advance.
6. Overall service: As an old five-star hotel, the service quality is generally commendable. The staff are very enthusiastic and professional. The concierge will take the initiative to help transport large luggage to the guest room. Guests staying in the hotel can also use the underground garage. Free parking.

msg:I booked a king-size bed room in the VIP Room and was given a higher floor, the 80th floor, when I checked in. Although it is not a river view room, you can still see the Huangpu River from two directions, and you can see Yangpu Bridge and Nanpu Bridge respectively. The scenery is good. The room facilities are well maintained and the sanitation is good, but there is a yellow stain on a face towel, the color is not deep, I didn't pay attention at first, but I found it after I used it. Other than that, everything else is good. The afternoon tea at the Regency Club is relatively shabby. There are only two kinds of fruit juice, a cupcake, a can of peanuts, a can of melon seeds, a can of biscuits, cantaloupe, longan, and some soft drinks, coffee and tea. Finally, the light meal at night is not bad. Although there are not many items, except for the steamed dishes, the taste is not bad, which suits my taste, especially the scallion noodles and the toppings of the spicy noodles. The toppings of the spicy noodles are authentic local spicy noodles The flavor of the toppings won my heart. The breakfast option is on the 56th floor. The breakfast variety is indeed limited for a hotel in this price range, but the taste is okay and the scenery is unbeatable. Overall, it was a satisfactory stay experience.

First of all, from the beginning of check-in, I didn’t know that Grand Hyatt was part of the Hyatt Group. I didn’t know until I arrived. I asked the waiter if it was cheaper to book through the small program. The waiter immediately started losing face and told her that she owed her a hundred dollars. Just in case, when there was an open bottle of water in the room, I called the hotel customer service center to ask, and they were able to ask a very stupid question like "Did you open it yourself?" Really train you ** employees! As a five-star hotel, the service is really bad!

msg:This five-star hotel in the center of Shanghai left a deep impression on me. The hotel is located on the bustling Huangpu River, across the river from the Bund and the Oriental Pearl Tower. It has convenient transportation and is surrounded by shopping malls and restaurants, providing tourists with a wealth of leisure and entertainment options.
The room I stayed in was spacious and bright, luxuriously decorated, equipped with high-quality furniture and appliances. Looking out from the window of the room, I can have a panoramic view of the Shanghai Bund and the Oriental Pearl Tower, which made me feel the unique charm of this city. The environment in the room is clean and tidy, the sanitary conditions are excellent, and the waiters are enthusiastic, making me feel at home.
The hotel's food and beverage services are also excellent. Rich variety, unique taste of Chinese and Western dishes, lunch and dinner offer more selected food, the taste is very good. In addition, the hotel also has a number of bars, cafes and restaurants, providing a variety of alcohol, coffee, tea and meals, providing guests with more choices.
The service of the hotel is very attentive, the staffs are friendly, and any problems can be solved in time. In terms of management, the hotel is also very standardized and has perfect systems to ensure the stable improvement of service quality.
Overall, this five-star hotel performs very well in terms of facilities, services and environment. I am very satisfied with this stay experience and highly recommend it to friends traveling to Shanghai. In a five-star review, I would give this hotel a perfect rating.

It's a pity that the decoration time is relatively long, and the facilities are relatively not updated in time, and there is no smart toilet and voice control.

As a result, there is a group of people waiting in line to check in. We arrived at the store at two o'clock and waited until three o'clock to check in. We paid a security deposit of 1600 online and paid another 1600 when we arrived at the store. The room fee of 16000 plus a deposit of 1400. . . The river view room I booked was only arranged on the 62nd floor, but when I went in, I found that there was no river view at all! The most outrageous thing is this window. A large floor-to-ceiling window is completely separated by five pillars. Normally, you can’t see any scenery. You can only take photos by sticking your phone on the window. I seriously doubt that the wrong room was arranged. After moving in, the washbasin was also blocked, and the water could not drain at all. I asked someone to repair it, but a cleaning lady knocked on the door twice and then pushed in, saying that she thought she was coming to clean the room. . I ordered takeaway and didn’t send it up. I filled the takeaway cabinet of Jinmao Building, but I had to go to the underground shopping mall on the second floor to get it. I went back and forth in the elevator. I don’t know why the tinnitus is very serious and my head hurts. I have never had anything like flying before. This happened before, a large group of tourists outside the building wandered around the entrance of the hotel. It didn't feel like a five-star hotel at all. The facilities were old and old. They went to Lujiazui Riverview, and that's the end result? The hotel is rubbish and the scenery is also rubbish. I might as well spend tens of dollars on tickets to go to the viewing platform to see the scenery

The room in the Regency Club is an executive room in Jinmao. But in the afternoon tea in the executive lounge, apart from some beverages, there was only one can of peanuts and one can of sunflower seeds, and there was nothing left! nothing left! I have never seen such an outrageous executive lounge!
Breakfast in the morning is also available in the executive lounge. The variety is not as rich as the whole season! ! ! See the picture below. Really just such a variety! That's really all there is to it! Does this mean it's five-star? Are you embarrassed to ask for a room fee of more than 2,000 yuan? Are you embarrassed to say that it is administrative trea**ent?
If you just want to rub against the tall buildings in Shanghai, it's okay. If you want to enjoy the trea**ent of a five-star hotel, don't come to Jinmao Grand Hyatt!

In addition, the atrium is dark, leading to the end, and the corridor lights are dim, which makes people feel very depressed.

msg:The hotel is located in Lujiazui. We booked a river view room for two nights and were arranged on the 82nd floor. The view was very good, and the Huangpu River, the Bund and the Oriental Pearl Tower were in full view. The overall environment of the hotel was very elegant and quiet. It may be because I stayed in the Disney Resort for three nights before. After comparison, I found that the service of Jinmao Grand Hyatt was not as warm and thoughtful as that of Disney. In general, it lacked the service awareness of a five-star hotel. The hardware belongs to the old five-star, and the facilities are relatively old. Many places in the room are not designed reasonably. For example, after the rain, there was serious water accumulation in the bathroom. The toilet was broken the next day after we checked in. The kettle in the room was sticky and dirty, and the waiter did not clean it. The washbasin should be placed with a bottle of skin cream, but it was placed with a bottle of conditioner. In general, it still lacks the serious attitude of a five-star hotel in terms of service. However, the location is still very good, and it is very convenient to go shopping and eat. I will choose to stay again.

The next day, they suddenly became very strict and no one was allowed to go into the water...

The most unbelievable thing was that I arrived at the hotel at 2:30 in the afternoon, started to draw numbers to check in, started sitting in the cold lobby next door, waiting for the number to be called, and started queuing up to check in at 6:00. Then we were told that the room had not been cleaned and it would take 1.5 hours at the fastest. We were asked to have dinner first. Just like this, I took my luggage to the first floor to store my luggage. I waited until 7:30 pm to be notified that the room would be cleaned and ready for check-in. I don’t want to continue commenting and won’t come again! ! ! !

You need to swipe your card to get to the room. The decoration in the room is a bit old, But it is very tidy, very clean, free drinking water, very well stocked, six bottles every time! The glass in the guest room is only for viewing because of the high altitude. The overall interior of the guest room looks very spectacular, giving people a strong sense of visual impact! The hotel’s breakfast is really rich, divided into Chinese and Western. While eating breakfast, you can overlook the big Shanghai. The hotel itself is one of the three-piece suits in Shanghai, so you don’t need to go to the sightseeing elevator to see the height and check in to take pictures, which is cumbersome. thing

msg:Guests who choose this hotel are advised to read the reviews of this hotel to look at the bad reviews, not the good ones, because I stayed for one night and almost experienced everything in the bad reviews. Several waiters in the front office made me feel that they were doing bad things on purpose. The deputy manager surnamed Long on the executive floor had a very bad attitude and treated Ctrip’s guests maliciously, even teasing them. The room feels like more than 1600 in the pictures of Ctrip. I found the male deputy manager at the front desk and made all kinds of sophistry. Please note that these two room types are fundamentally different! All kinds of prevarication when I strongly demanded to see the top management of the hotel. Please ask the waiters in the front hall to touch their consciences. Your character is not correct, are you suitable to be waiters in a hotel? The front office is the heart of the entire hotel. What is your purpose for doing this? Who gave you the confidence to let you do bad things here? I hope that the hotel or your group's senior management will pay attention to it. For some waiters, they must be cleaned up in a timely manner. A few rat droppings ruined a pot of porridge!

msg:I wanted to write this bad review since I first checked in. The room was booked for more than 3,000 a night with breakfast. It was not written on Ctrip that the room comes with breakfast. I thought it would cost extra to order breakfast. So I ordered breakfast. I haven’t entered it yet. The room moved me to write an 800-character short essay. The hotel is located in the Jinmao Tower. The entrance is small and narrow. If I bring a suitcase into the revolving door, it will get stuck. The elevator does not go directly to the floor, so you have to go from the 1st floor Take the elevator to the lobby on the 54th floor and then transfer to the special elevator to the room. The food I ordered can only be delivered to a small table on the first floor. When I first arrived at the door, I thought I came to the wrong place. The check-in place was full of people, the train station Not only the sense of sight, but also the waiter next to us to rank us! ? Okay, let's get our number and go to line up. Just as we walked over, another waiter came and asked us to go to the next hall and wait for our number to be called! ? I'm not angry, I'll wait, and it will be 3:27 in the afternoon. Receptionist: Hello, sir, the room type you booked has not been cleaned yet. Please wait for another ten minutes. I looked at the watch and was very confused. What time do you check out at the front desk? The front desk said: We are checking out at 12 o'clock. I said @now 3:27, tell me now that you checked out at 12 o'clock, your room is not ready yet, right? "Maybe the front desk was annoyed at seeing me, so I called and came back to say that the room has been cleaned up. He also said hello, the room type you booked comes with breakfast, and the breakfast for two you booked on Ctrip means that you can Choose to go to the 56th floor or the 83rd floor to have breakfast. (I don’t remember how much I ordered for breakfast, but it’s a few hundred yuan less.) After entering the room, the first feeling is whether I will feel aggrieved sitting in this bathroom with my figure The layout of the room is also very strange. The switch to close the blinds is on the left side of the window, but if you want to go to the left, please take off your shoes and enter the bathtub to adjust the blinds. The button for the electric curtains does not look like a decoration It was planned at the time. There was dry tea left by someone in the teapot in the room. There was a desk and an office chair in the room. The takeaway I ordered for two people didn’t have enough stools to move the bed footstool as a chair. There are obvious scratches on the floor. Of course, if it wasn’t for the bad first impression, I wouldn’t lie down on the ground to see your scratches. I don’t know why the downstairs of the hotel has become a place for Internet celebrities to check in. At night, people are everywhere around the downstairs of the hotel to take pictures There are a lot of rubbish bottles on the ground after I left. My review may not be very objective, but who made you give me a very bad first impression. I don't feel like a customer of your hotel, like I begged you to let me in Your hotel consumption is the same. Thank you for telling me that there are bad things about expensive things.
Courtesy of the Regency Club for two (enjoy breakfast on the executive floor): there is nothing to eat, I don’t know what it’s called, noodles, smoked salmon, various pastries, bread and milk bar. There may be steamed buns and the like, maybe I went late and didn’t see it. Take it. I will write it here first. I wrote it when I took the time to wait for the plane😬

msg:Let me tell you the good things first, we lived on the 81st floor after we arrived at the store. This floor height is still very good, except that it is not facing the Huangpu River, because it is not a river view room, it is still acceptable. There is a conference room on the 54th floor where you can see the panorama, as shown in Figure 2 below. Let me talk about the bad. The doorknob of the shower room was very dirty. Someone came to clean it after I called the front desk a few times, and it was still not clean. Of course, there was a small step in the shower room at night when I checked in. I used to grab it I didn't grasp the armrest firmly, and I didn't know if it was dirt or something, and my scalp was a little numb. Then focus on breakfast, because we live on the 81st floor, the hotel has given us the right to have breakfast on the 56th and 83rd floors. The first day is still normal, ordinary breakfast is no longer normal, and the second day we go to the 83rd floor to have breakfast is 9: Around 15, I feel messy in the wind, no place, no fruit, no bread, no plate, many ingredients are gone, and many customers continue to come in and wait, the waiter is very busy, but the kitchen can't get anything out, more than 200 yuan Bit of breakfast, it's a joke. Overall evaluation, if you just want to see the scenery, you can still do it. As for the experience of a star hotel, it is indeed too average.

There was a long line for check-in on the 54th floor, but thanks to the room I happened to reserve, I was able to check in smoothly on the 84th floor without waiting, and I was able to enjoy breakfast at the club floor on the 83rd floor. .

The seats on the breakfast floor are never full, so it doesn't feel crowded, but partly because it was during the summer vacation, many people came and went, and the glass-enclosed main floor was a little noisy, but the sofa in the back. The floor was calm. This is also the 83rd floor, the scenery was good!
I feel that the breakfast had a little less variety. But I have no complaints. The food was delicious and the staff were friendly. I was wondering if the breakfast floor on the 56th floor had more variety.

At the time of check-out, I was able to take a break while enjoying tea and a little sweets on the 83rd floor before heading home. I was able to spend more elegantly than usual in a room with options.

There is also a discount emerald store, which is not at all like a high-end hotel. There are too many people waiting in the lobby. There was a line to check in on the 54th floor, and the efficiency of the front desk was too slow, so I waited for 50 minutes. The facilities are old. The sofa has already sat out of the hole, and the mattress support is no longer good, so I won't live anymore.

When my friend came to check in the next day, I finally sat in a room with seats, and then got the number and waited for the number to be called. There were two ladies (staff) chatting next to me, and I didn't care about it at all. It’s really the first time I’ve seen it. Before I came to Shanghai, I always lived in Banyan Tree. The service. . . worlds apart. Then at night, I had dinner at the buffet on the 56th floor. This is the worst dinner buffet in a five-star hotel I have ever eaten. . . .
During dinner, my friend picked up the juice, and the waiter added it to it, and got my friend's hand. He didn't even apologize or say a word. My friend was shocked. . .
excuse me. It is the first time to stay at Grand Hyatt Jinmao, and it is also the last time. I often take our children to Disney, and I will not book here again. The Grand Hyatt in Xi'an is also much better than this, probably because it is Shanghai.
The only advantage is that the floor is high and the scenery is good.

msg:I took my mother-in-law with my child to stay at the Grand Hyatt Shanghai on weekends. We booked the Grand Hyatt River View Twin Room. We put the two beds together to form a big bed. The children were very happy. We checked in on the 54th floor. Our room type was on the 76th floor, facing On the side of the Oriental Pearl Tower, there are two windows in the room, with a wide view. The room is relatively clean and the shower faucet is cool. There is a Lawson convenience store on the B3 floor. We went to buy snacks at 10 o'clock in the evening. You can see it when you get off the elevator and turn left at B3.
Overall, I am very satisfied. I booked a river view twin room at a little over 2,000 a week in advance. I hope I can give you a discount next time.
The morning is also good, very rich, the child is 6 years old (no extra charge for meals)

msg:I personally think that if you come to Shanghai, you must check in at Shanghai Jinmao Grand Hyatt Hotel😇 Our family of three stays in Jinmao Regency Club (you can enjoy breakfast on the executive floor, and there are evening cocktails and European desserts in the package, but I missed it😅😅) We have two-way breakfast Choose (83 or 56 floors, I personally prefer 56😛 It feels closer to the Huangpu River, breakfast is from 6:30--10:30, I am lazy, I went at 9:00 and ate at 10:30, I need it here In particular, when it's almost time, the waiter will come to you and remind you quietly, which is very heartwarming 😍), by the way, the viewing angle of 270°C on the 56th floor is amazing. I looked up for breakfast and could see the Oriental Pearl Tower I tasted it slowly (Western and Chinese dishes are available), and the clouds outside today are also very low, and I feel like I am in the clouds.
   As for the room, I am very satisfied. You can see the central building when you look up, and you can see the Huangpu River in the distance. You can have a panoramic view of the riverside scenery. It feels like you are in the clouds. The indoor facilities are also carefully thought out, and every detail is considered just right. On the bedside wall is a song "Boat Movement" by Huang Fusong from the Tang Dynasty. It is so poetic and picturesque. Sitting on it and looking at the beautiful scenery of Shanghai, I really feel happy and bright in my heart. It is especially decompressing. It is a veritable vacation and the night view of the Bund in Shanghai at night panoramic view. When you wake up in the morning and raise the sunshade, don’t take a deep breath and look outside. Don’t mention how refreshing you are. It feels like sleeping in the clouds. Overlooking the Huangpu River, many boats docked on both sides are shrouded in the morning mist, which adds a lot of fun.
        I can't wait to bring the elderly to experience it now, and I recommended it to my colleagues for the first time. In short, I really fell in love with this place. My friends, I highly recommend it 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍

The swimming pool is great, and the buffet breakfast is also very rich.
Although it has been in business for more than 20 years, there is no smart toilet,

There is Mr. Xu Chenyang with two golden keys at the front desk,
The service is very professional and friendly. I recommend it to everyone. It is worth staying here.

You can only check in at 3:00 p.m., and you have to queue for 40 minutes to check in. I have stayed in many five-star hotels and this situation is not like yours. During the queuing period, only 3 windows are open, and the staff at 3 windows check in quickly! ! Turtle speed! ! Can't you see that there are already more than 20 customers in line? ? The other staff were standing by and waiting! !
After checking in, we found that the fire sprinkler and spotlights in the room were leaking, which was a very serious fire safety hazard. We contacted the front desk to deal with it, but only sent a person from the engineering depar**ent to take a look and left. Then we contacted the front desk twice, but there was no response. Answer, is there a serious problem with hotel management? ? Do guests have to go to the front desk to report to the hotel? ? That's it? ?

msg:This is a hotel I will never stay in again. First of all, it took a long time to check in, and the service attitude was not enthusiastic, ***. The luggage took more than three hours and I couldn't bear it. I went down to urge it myself, and it was finally delivered. They said they forgot. They sent White Rabbit milk candy and a can of almonds as an apology. I think, if you don't have the ability, don't take this job. Instead, it causes trouble for others.
The facilities are very simple. Less than half an hour after entering the door, the painting on the wall suddenly tilted and almost fell down. Finally, the waiter thought of a good way---moving the painting away. Then I asked him what else would fall? He asked me to take another look. Haha.
Most of the furnishings in the whole room are glass, which is very low-grade. The toilet cover is not blocked. Everyone must make sure it will not fall down suddenly when using it. However, the trash can cover next to the toilet is blocked. Let's take a look at the bathroom. The bathtub is about 1.5 meters long. The anti-human design of the shower room is the first time I have seen it in a five-star hotel. According to the instructions (on the glass desk), I should use the shower head correctly. I should use it with some force, but not too much force, otherwise it will remind you of the scene of a sprinkler truck suddenly spraying water. The water in the wash basin is not smooth, so it is better not to use a plug. The comb in the toiletries is a must, as shown in the picture. I wanted to go swimming, but the swimming pool is really small. It feels only one-third of the Ritz-Carlton or standard swimming pool.
In short, it is worth mentioning that the repairman and the aunt who cleans the room should have some experience working in large hotels and are very polite. But it can't change my bad review of this hotel. It's really bad, and the experience is very bad!

After arriving at the hotel at 12 o'clock, I wanted to apply for two rooms to stay at the same time and on the same floor. The hotel said that the previous guest had left but the room had not been cleaned. I went to get the room card at two or three o'clock. I told the front desk to clean the room as soon as possible. After the cleaning was done, I called me. Because I still didn't call at five o'clock in the afternoon, the child had fallen asleep in the hotel outside. I had no choice but to do it. Take a taxi back to the hotel. When I came back to the hotel again, the hotel told me that the room had not been cleaned yet, and suggested that the two rooms I ordered could not be on the same floor and that the king-sized bed room needed to be converted into a king-bed room. After disagreeing, the hotel did not actively coordinate and handled the problem for half the time. It took more than an hour to get the room card. During this period, I had a stomachache and went to the lobby bathroom to use the toilet door, which was still locked! I went back to the front desk to inform the hotel and then said "ok" but there was no result😅😅 I originally thought that this hotel has a good location, but I didn't expect that the service can't keep up with hotels with more than 4000000 people

msg:As the earliest and most well-established hotel among the iconic three-piece hotels in Shanghai, I won’t say much about the hardware, facilities and soft services. Let me introduce some of the hotel’s features:
The first one is the most famous feature of the hotel. Sitting in the sky court on the 56th floor, you can look up to the top of the building at a glance, as shown in the first picture. It is very spectacular, shocking and classic! !
The second one is the afternoon tea in the hotel. Whether it is Tianting on the 56th floor or Jiuchongtian on the 87th floor, in addition to the beautiful scenery, the pastries are also very 🈶️ special and delicious. It is definitely a place for online celebrities in Shanghai...
The third is that the scenery outside the hotel window is very beautiful, whether it is night, morning or sunset, when you stay in the hotel and look around, it is a beautiful landscape in itself...
Finally, what I want to share with you is that compared with the other two in the three-piece suite, the price of Grand Hyatt Hotel is very close to the people, and the price is very high. It is very worthwhile for everyone to stay and experience it.

msg:This Jinmao "Grand Hyatt" is really unworthy of the brand name. The service is extremely poor and arrogant, the room facilities are old, and the swimming pool is very small. The details are as follows:
Arrived at the hotel at 2:30, the front desk informed that the room was "being tidied up" within 20 minutes, and at the same time described the location and structure of the room, helped to store the luggage, and said that it would be good to pick up the room card at the front desk in 20 minutes, I thought it was quite considerate Yes, I came back half an hour later and found the same front desk. The other party was very arrogant at first, and then did not register us in any room. At this time, at 3 o'clock, I waited for 20 minutes at the front desk and temporarily arranged us in a big bed. The room asked us to wait inside. When we entered, the smell was very damp and pungent. No one came to find us until 4:30, so we had to call the front desk to ask what was going on. It turned out to be funny. We called twice and no one came. Pick up (Are 5-star hotels so negligent 😂 ) Finally, through the customer service center, I finally contacted the hotel staff and said to remind me, and then maybe ten minutes later, someone came to deliver the room card, but finally the check-in was successful.
Every time you call the front desk, you need to "beep the phone a lot - connect and say what you need - wait for 20 minutes for no one to serve you - call again for beep/no answer - wait for another ten minutes - someone will come to serve you" I hope everyone will do this well Time to prepare, or endure it.
Finally, I would like to mention the swimming pool. I regret not taking pictures. It is the smallest pool I have ever seen 😂 There is a narrow crescent in the children's area, and two extremely narrow swimming lanes in the adult area.

msg:The last time I lived next to Park Hyatt, I chose Grand Hyatt this time, but it turned out that "Jun is not happy at all".

Let’s talk about hygiene and environment first, look at the floating dust in the air and the old dust accumulated on the bedside table, as shown in Figure 1. Moreover, the middle of the guest room floor is hollowed out, there is no safety protection, and the risk factor is very high. (Figure 1, 2, 3)

Besides the service, I arrived at the lobby around 11:30 in the middle of the night, the front desk had a red shirt and a dark coat, the light was dim, and it looked scary. The four of them were still queuing, and when they saw that the guests didn't take the initiative to say hello, they also looked like a gentleman. The next morning, I found a notice on the table in the room, the water was cut off, and the front desk didn't remind me yesterday. (Figure 4, 5)

Finally, let's talk about the facilities. It may be trendy to live in the 90s, but it is not flattering now. The bedside socket is far away from the bedside, and the charging cable is just enough to go from the socket to the bedside, which is very inconvenient (Figure 9). The bathtub fell off as soon as the knob was tightened (Picture 6). When I opened the comb the next morning, I was speechless: the same toiletries as the two hundred yuan hotel (Picture 7). Picture 8 is the breakfast, and it is also drunk, which is below three stars.

Will not book Grand Hyatt again in the future.

IFC and Zhengda are all within a 5-kilometer walk. The hotel has swimming pools, steam rooms, sauna rooms, and gyms. After checking in, I found that I can overlook the Huangpu River and Shanghai Center, and the Oriental Pearl Tower at night can be seen in the hotel lobby. Beautiful.
The slight disadvantage is that the occupancy rate of the hotel is so high that it is almost hard to find a room?

Every detail is quality. You can see the high-rise river view from the sky The group includes the Oriental Pearl Tower, the shopping is in the link building, and the surrounding IFC Global is very convenient to walk to, including the subway entrance, etc. It is convenient to walk everywhere, including walking along the Huangpu River. The key block is the Shanghai financial core area and high-rise buildings. The whole room is spectacular. The facilities are complete and the service is good. We must support the Chinese people's own good brands and good quality! By the way, I stayed in the hotel by laying asphalt in the local community to avoid the smell, but I have also stayed in many hotels on business trips. The real experience is really good, and I will give it a try. I was not disappointed this time. The key price is also affordable. The location, the quality, the scenery, etc. are really good.

The service of Cantonese cuisine on the 55th floor is so-so, the pigeon is unpalatable, the soup is heavy and salty. Looking forward to staying for a long time, disappointed....

msg:The river view twin room we booked is far worse than the river view on the Bund before. We can only see the Oriental Pearl Tower from the side, and the room is not the kind of large glass floor-to-ceiling windows. The viewing effect is not very good, and the decoration is relatively old It's old, and the sink is full of watermarks that haven't been wiped clean. What's even more ridiculous is that in such a big five-star hotel, the guest depar**ent doesn't even have a paper cup... The reason is that the colleague in charge of purchasing is sick... It's the middle of May, and I really don't know Speechless, the shower design in the bathroom is really weird... I can only say that there is a good location, and you can get it with a card. I will never stay there again...

In the evening, you can go to the small lounge on the 87th floor to feel it. For breakfast, there must be a queue on May Day.

msg:Due to going to Shanghai for a follow-up visit, I went over the weekend ahead of schedule, and this time I chose to stay at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Lujiazui
Location: Jinmao Grand Hyatt is one of the three-piece suites in Shanghai. It is located in the bustling area of Lujiazui. You can get to Lujiazui on Metro Line 2. It is relatively close to the Oriental Pearl Tower. There are Shanghai Aquarium and Disney flagship store nearby. Shopping and eating are quite convenient

Service: The service of the hotel is good. It said on the Internet that you can check in at 3 pm. We checked in directly when we arrived that day, and the front desk staff gave us a detailed introduction. It was Sunday, I printed the materials in the business center, but when I went to the front desk to pay, I queued up for a long time. The weekend is so busy, can't we open a few more windows? And like us who just pay, we should set up a temporary shortcut window

Hygiene: The sanitation is still very clean, and the cleaning is quite diligent

Environment: The environment is good. The river view room we booked was arranged on a high floor. The river view is very good, but Jinmao's floor is full of grids, and the river view is a bit uncomfortable

Facilities: The facilities are pretty good, the bathroom is separated from the wet and dry, and you can soak in the bathtub at night to enjoy the scenery of the Huangpu River and wash away the fatigue of the day
    Staying at Jinmao, the first round of drinks in the minibar in the room is free, which is good. Breakfast is on the 56th floor. The breakfast area is divided into two sides, Chinese style and Western style. You need to queue up for breakfast on the first day on the weekend, and you don’t need to queue up on the second day on Monday. The waiter will introduce it to you when you have a seat.
     Overall, it's good. If I have the opportunity to go to Shanghai in the future, I will still choose to stay.

I said I was going to do something, but I couldn’t take my luggage with me, and I didn’t feel comfortable storing it because I brought a work laptop. It was an 18-inch laptop and I really couldn’t take it with me.
I asked if they could see if they could check me in first. The front desk looked impatient and told me to pay half the day's room fee and they would get a room.
It turns out that you have to pay more. It’s not that there is really no room. It’s funny. I really understand that there is really no room available.
According to this, will customers who arrive at night be able to refund the price difference?
The receptionist had an indifferent attitude and greeted the foreigner in front of me with a smile.
It's okay. Just treat the 750 as poverty alleviation. Rubbish hotel ****

I originally booked a twin room, but because I had to wait for the cleaning, I flexibly adjusted the double room and added a small bed. The children were also very happy.

I was hoping for a plan that allows lounge use, and I finally found it after searching online, but I booked that room using the official app. It was a cheap room with a nice view, but I was disappointed that the metal of the washbasin was rusty and the closet was dusty. The breakfast buffet was very nice. It's divided into left and right from the entrance, so if you're not careful, you might think there's only one. Western food on the right and Chinese food on the left. Next time I come, I want to study Chinese before coming.

In the afternoon, there is also a plate of fruit from the hotel, so considerate! I will come back next time I come to Shanghai! A little suggestion is to call the swimming pool in the afternoon to ask when there are few people. They said what time and when we went, they told us that the swimming pool needs to be reserved. There was no mention of the reservation on the phone. Read it The swimming pool is a bit small and there will be no swimming that night, so if you need to make an appoin**ent, it is best to explain in advance~

The room facilities are old and the breakfast has very few varieties. When the meal time comes, the variety is not complete and the tableware has to be found. Speechless➕speechless
The advantage is that it is in a good location and has a high floor

Although I booked a river view room, the window glass was covered with a thick layer of dust as if it hadn't been washed for hundreds of years, and I couldn't even take pictures! To be honest, I don’t know how many times better this price is at the same price! In addition to the advantage of floor scenery, other service facilities are in a mess! Never again! It seems that passengers who come to Shanghai will carefully consider this hotel!

They told me that it was because I booked a city view room and not a river view room. But when I looked out the window, it was clearly there. Jiang, there is no city view? It was clear that I was assigned a corner room with a bad view, and the worst part was that I booked it half a month in advance, and it turned out to be much more expensive than that day. The price I booked on that day was enough for a king-size bed room with river view. Let’s talk about breakfast, the service is really bad, the variety is pitiful, even a fried egg has to wait for a long time, there is no jam on the table, the milk bucket can’t dispense milk, I told the waiter, and after going around, there is no replenishment. , soy sauce and vinegar do not indicate that you have to smell it yourself. Is it hygienic for everyone to smell it? As for the swimming pool, I asked when I checked in in the afternoon and was told that it was fully booked and could only accommodate 10 people an hour. It’s so bad, so bad, so bad!

I checked in at 12 o'clock in the evening and the front desk told me that I could upgrade my room. I was very happy and thanked me profusely. When I entered the room, I found that the room was small and irregular. The TV cannot be placed frontally and is placed on the side (as shown in the picture). A door appeared in the room next to it (as shown in the picture, the hotel said it was a door-to-door room, I don't understand), and then I felt that it was upgraded, and it felt like a suite was changed into two rooms. The conclusion is that there is a serious lack of soundproofing. You can clearly hear everything said on the other side. It happens to be a wedding room, and a lot of people have been busy since 6 o'clock in the morning. It is impossible to sleep. Here, we remind hotels to operate with integrity and not to swindle guests. This is not an upgrade, but a downgrade in essence. I judged that the person at the front desk was a bit bad and did it on purpose.

I booked the hotel for my father
1. We arrived at two o'clock, and there was a long queue at first. After we arrived, we checked our ID cards and were told that the room would not be available until three o'clock. We didn't say anything after all, check-in was written at three o'clock. My dad came back at three o'clock nearby, and the hotel said that the room was being disinfected and it would take another half an hour. My dad was a little unhappy and didn't say anything, so he waited in the lobby until he fell asleep. He woke up again at 3:45. I asked if it was okay, and then the waiter said it was not okay yet. My dad got very angry and asked what was going on. Then the waiter went back to the work area and whispered for two minutes and immediately told my dad that the room was ready! Is this the rhythm of the room being tidied up in one minute? How funny!
2. My dad finally entered the room at four o'clock and found that there was no kettle. Please, don't you have it in all express hotels?
3. I went over to see my dad in the evening and heard that he didn’t have a kettle. After looking around, it turned out there was none. Then I called and asked if there were disposable bathtub bags. The room service there didn't answer the phone at first. I called the second or third time and waited for a long time before finally answering (no exaggeration). Then the other person's tone was very cold and said You can scan the room QR code to purchase! Please! I have stayed in many hotels, whether they are better or worse than yours, they either don’t have them or provide them for free. The first time I encountered a bathtub bag, I had to charge for it! I'm really going to vomit!
4. The service is as bad as ever. I stayed there once and booked it for someone else. The service was indifferent and there was no smile. It was really not like a high-end hotel!
5. The next day, my dad went to have breakfast. There were two breakfast areas that were a bit far apart. My dad got Western food there, and there was no Chinese food here. They only had bread and stuff. My dad asked twice. The waiter in the restaurant, is that all? He said yes, but my dad reluctantly ate some bread, and then said he was looking for fruit, only to find that it was in another direction. When he went there, he realized that the Chinese food was here, and the waiter didn't even give any hint! But my dad couldn’t eat anymore and ended up eating some fruit! Nearly three hundred dollars for breakfast, and that’s it? The waiters all graduated from elementary school and have no qualifications at all! I'm really convinced!
6. Finally, the bed was too soft and uncomfortable to sleep on.

The summary is that I am very disappointed. I saw that Ctrip's score of 4.6 was not very high, and I thought it might not be high. However, I would say 3 points is considered high, especially the service, which is not as good as a fast hotel! Will never visit again! Bad 👎

msg:The room decoration is old and the old hotel has a peculiar smell. The window partitions in the room are too small and seem depressing. The Regency Suite I booked cost over RMB 3,000. The room was small and the environment was mediocre. It was not worth it. The breakfast area on the 83rd floor is very small, with too few breakfast varieties and a crowded environment. During breakfast, there was a ***** who was making loud noises. I really wanted to slap her. All in all, the experience was very poor. I will probably not stay here again in the future. I would recommend other hotels.

The plastic cover installed at the check-in counter has no other function except to make it inconvenient for guests to sign. Secondly, the staff lacks rules and service awareness. When I was checking in, someone came in and asked for a paper bag. The most basic training should be to put guests first, not to mention inserting half of it in. Thirdly, I was in the same elevator with the staff, waiting for me to close the elevator door and grab it. I went out alone and leaned in the elevator playing with my mobile phone. These were employees wearing work uniforms; fourth, there was no turndown service at all, which is the most basic thing; fifth, the hotel facilities were a bit old, and the glass sink water The stains were not clean and the room smelled of cigarette smoke.

msg:When I booked the hotel, I considered that the hotel facilities were too old, but there were only 2 people at the front desk on the 54th floor, which was very small at the gate 3 of the hotel. It took more than 20 minutes to check in, but it was not ordinary old when I entered the room, like government affairs at the guest house! The sink is full of water to wash your hands, and the whole shower is very old! The hotel telephone guest service center has to call 4-5 times each time before someone answers it. This is the case every time after staying for 4 nights. Even if you call at 11 o'clock in the evening to deliver a bath towel, it takes 27 minutes to deliver it! The worst thing is that the sound insulation of this hotel is very, very, very poor. The front desk knew that we brought a 3-year-old child to check in and arranged a connecting room. As a result, the guest next door started an intimate exercise at 12 o'clock in the evening, and the sound woke up the child directly. The child asked my aunt why she yelled so loudly, but we had no choice but to knock on the door next door to remind me, especially since there is no sound insulation, sneezing and coughing can be heard clearly. Just in time for the rainy and strong winds in Shanghai these days, the 65th floor we stayed in is like living on a boat. The wind outside the window does not matter, because the high-rise building shakes and the decorative wall panels behind the bed creak rhythmically. I contacted the hotel and the result was delivered. Ordered 3 pairs of disposable earplugs for us! The only thing I recommend is that the location of the hotel is very convenient in the Lujiazui area. It is very convenient to go to IFC or Shanghai Center on the ba*****t floor. The most convenient thing is that there is a Lawson 24-hour convenience store in B3 of the building, which is very convenient! But this convenience seems to be a package of Jinmao Tower, and has nothing to do with the hotel! Anyway, Jinmao Grand Hyatt is also a five-star hotel! Hardware and software can't keep up at all! Will not consider living in the future! Especially with children it feels very, very bad!

Although there were many people during the National Day, the expensive room fee and breakfast had to be queued up. Many dishes were swept away by so many guests without adding any extra dishes, which made people lament the quality of the service. The most annoying thing is that I have checked out for 3 days and the hotel has not yet checked my check-in record. As a result, Ctrip's security deposit cannot be refunded to me, and I have to contact the hotel again. I just called the hotel and no one answered. Finally, I would like to comment on the room. The night view is good, but the facilities are relatively old, the bathroom is small, and the water in the bathroom will flow out to the floor.

Later, I showed the reservation code, and then it was reduced back to 788 yuan. I think some are too… .. Apart from this, the experience is very good, especially the late check-out at noon, which is still in place^_^ In short, it is a representative of Shanghai hotels! Recommended!

msg:When I returned to the hotel after playing at midnight on National Day, I wanted to go back to take a shower and lie down. When I got to the elevator, I found that the room card could not be swiped no matter how I tried it, so I went to the front desk to ask what was going on. The reservation was made two days ago but it didn't happen because I forgot to renew the room card. As a result, Ms. Vivian at the front desk told me with a bad attitude, "If you put the phone and the room card together, they will be demagnetized." I told her that they had never been put together before! I have stayed in many hotels. It is very simple to replace the room card. The most you can do is check your identity with me. I didn’t expect to encounter this kind of situation? She actually ignored people without saying a word? After a while, he told me to find a manager to explain to me. So this is the so-called employee quality of Jinmao and Grand Hyatt? "Although a manager explained it to me later, I still hope that your employee training and assessment of the basic quality of employees can be worthy of the Grand Hyatt brand and the not-so-cheap room rates.

This time I booked an ordinary twin room, but the front desk staff thoughtfully arranged a floor and orientation with a better view. In addition, I would like to praise the fitness center on the 57th floor. The facilities are complete and easy to use, but the swimming pool is too small to accommodate too many swimmers at the same time. This is why swimming needs to be reserved. It is understandable.

You can see the Oriental Pearl Tower on the Huangpu River. You can park for free when you stay at the hotel. This time, you have enough time to go to the gym. There are quite a lot of facilities, such as a treadmill for chest pushing and leg training. But this time there is a shortcoming. Although the swimming pool is open, the water will be too cold. It takes a long time to go into the water, but after coming out, there is a hot spring pool. I spent the whole pool hahaha, but overall it’s not bad, and I would recommend Jinmao to my friends who come to Shanghai!

1. Before checking in, call the hotel phone number ending with #1234. Before I finish speaking, hang up directly (you can directly hear the sound of putting the phone on the landline). I know you are very busy, but you don’t even know the basics. There are no closing words!
2. After arriving at the hotel, it was raining heavily that day. No one helped open the door when we got off the bus, and no one helped with the luggage.
3. When we arrived at the hotel, the concierge saw that we were looking for the hotel front desk and told us that we could take the elevator to the hotel front desk floor.
4. During the entire process of C/I and C/I at the front desk, the staff did not smile at all, and even told me "he is very tired" from his face. I understand that people in the service industry work long hours, are very hard and tired, but At least you don't make me feel tired. There is no introduction during the application process. It’s really just a very basic assistance in handling C/I
5. Arriving at the room, I found stains in the toilet. There are a lot of stains, yellow spots, etc. on the curtains and carpets. . .
6. When I returned to the hotel in the evening, it was already very late. I was very tired. I wanted to take a shower and go to bed quickly. I had to go out early the next day. It turned out that there was no way to pull down the bathroom curtain, so I had no choice but to contact the staff, who had to force it down manually.
7. The shower head for bathing was still broken. Because I was too tired, I didn’t contact the staff for repair again. I didn’t use the shower head for a few days after I checked in 🙂
8. The electric curtains in the guest room also malfunctioned the next day, and the staff finally forced them to raise them manually.

Summarize:
1. The facilities are really, really old.
2. It can be said that the service attitude of the service staff is really bad.
3. Hygiene is not very clean
4. The overall price/performance ratio is very poor!

The power supply is not easy to use and inconvenient. I don’t know if the hair dryer is broken or because of the power supply problem. I have changed the power supply several times and it still doesn’t work. Because I only stayed for one night, I didn’t get any response from you. I originally wanted to stay for a few more days, but it really didn’t work. The stay was so uncomfortable. The most unacceptable thing was that you had to pay a deposit. When you wanted to cancel, I had to force you to cancel. In such a big hotel, you were charged for drinks in the refrigerator. I was speechless😓. I originally wanted to book. It's a self-service. The waiter who answered the phone was very cold and impatient, as if he owed her something. The service when leaving the store was completely different from when entering the store. There was no intimacy. In short, it was so disappointing.

Service; I want to focus on this. I came here because of the reputation. I looked at the photos online and checked in. I said the quality of the Grand Hyatt is not bad, so I came. After checking in after 12 o'clock, the extra-large bed is not big, so it's great if you have children. Let's get a twin bed. I didn't move at all when I entered the original room. I kept feeling dizzy and a little nauseous during this period. Because I just came here by car and thought I was motion sick, I went out to eat and felt fine. When I came back, I was still dizzy when I entered the room. I felt sick. I felt it was a problem with my health. I communicated with the front desk and wanted to check out. The reply was that I couldn’t check out after checking in for too long. 2 hours was too long, but it didn’t matter. It was also my personal problem. I couldn’t force check out. I said Please change to a lower floor. The reply said that you have already changed rooms once, and you requested a higher floor for your stay. There is nothing wrong with that, but I am very uncomfortable with your attitude. If it were not for personal health reasons, I would not change rooms back and forth. It was also very troublesome to take care of children. I didn’t know that I would have such a strong reaction to the high-rise hotel. Later I stopped staying and checked out. I also paid for the room myself. I will never stay at the Grand Hyatt in the future! ! ! ! !

I booked the room the day before and could not check in until 3 pm. I finally got 54 As a courtesy, storage is not allowed on this floor. We ask you to store it on the 1st floor. It feels like a state-owned enterprise. 4. Don’t even give a glass of water to the Regency Hotel, and you will ignore it. 5. Breakfast is just a few dry breads and no vegetables. Noodles and raw noodles. In short, it is the worst experience among the star hotels and express hotels I have ever stayed in. It feels like it is designed to fool outsiders. That’s enough😡

My husband and I asked separately, and the maximum result I asked was 1:00. My husband asked about 1:30, but they couldn’t agree on the same explanation. The management was too chaotic, not as good as Atour.

msg:The worst experience ever. I have booked a lot of rooms in Jinmao in the past few years. This is the first time I encountered a room where the deposit lasted for more than a week and was refunded only after calling for inquiries. I was a little scared when I thought about it. If I hadn’t called to check, would the fees have been there all the time? It will not be refunded. The answer I received from the front desk was that it would be refunded between the 10th and 12th. I asked my friend who paid the deposit and said that it would be refunded after a phone call. As a consumer, I don’t know if I can know the process and details. What is the reason? I missed the refund of the deposit. The problem is that I made several inquiry calls from 12 am to nearly 5 pm. It took 3 customer service calls to get an accurate answer. Moreover, I kept calling to inquire. This should not be a 5-star rating.

msg:Don't step into the trap! Discourage! Discourage! I painstakingly wrote the following feelings to the hotel management and guests.
Grand Hyatt Shanghai, five-star fees, garbage service. I booked a hotel for three days and two nights, and the service was completely disappointing. But the manager Frank also politely suggested that I write a feedback appeal.
1. First of all, the contract stated that the room could be obtained at three o'clock in the afternoon, but it turned out that the room was not obtained until 5 o'clock, and the lobby and lobby were full of waiting passengers.
2. When I got the room, I was not informed about the swimming pool, breakfast floor and time, arrangements, etc. There is no introduction paper.
3. The hotel staff never said that swimming requires a reservation. We took our children, put on swimsuits, and went to the swimming pool, only to be told that it was a Shanghai government regulation and we were asked to leave. Do I need to hold the Shanghai government accountable? Doesn’t the hotel have the responsibility to inform guests?
4. During the two days I stayed in the room, I called the front desk from the phone in the room, but no one from the concierge answered it. The manager said that maybe he was too busy and lacked manpower!
Lots of excuses! Poor service, very disappointed!

The unified start after 3 o'clock, we waited at least two hours before checking in. There is no time compensation, and you must check out at 12 noon the next day. Waiting in line for breakfast. The room is not equipped with a comb toothbrush and children's slippers. This is understandable. It is environmentally friendly now, but I asked the hotel customer service and said that it can be delivered. I know that it has not been delivered after dinner at night. During the period, I called four times to urge. In the end, I really had no way to get mad before sending it over, without any apology. The hotel's various behaviors have been recorded and complained to the Consumer Association. I didn't expect to run into a shop bully here. I don't know how many stars this hotel has, but this kind of service can win stars. If you don't believe me, you can experience it yourself. This kind of service is sorry for the price, and I will not go there again in the future.

It contrasts sharply with the room. The restaurant is not big, and you need to wait for a seat when you arrive at 9 o'clock, but you can enter after waiting for two minutes. The food is all freshly baked, which is commendable👍. I came from the hotel in Nanjing before, and the bread for breakfast was not made that day.

msg:The hotel is located in the core area of ​​Pudong, with a strategic location. This is also the main reason for choosing it. However, when I visited this hotel again 20 years later, my experience was very poor. Perhaps before the Chinese New Year, the hotel did not anticipate that there would be a tourism peak during the first Spring Festival after the COVID-19 epidemic was relaxed. The hotel provided a 40% or 60% discount on prices for specific periods during the Spring Festival on Ctrip. Because I needed to leave Shanghai for San Francisco during the hotel discount period, I booked a king bed river view room for three nights very early, which happened to be 46% off on the room rate during that time. Unexpectedly, in addition to discounted room prices, everything is also discounted.
It was past midnight when we arrived at the hotel from Pudong Airport. The hotel front desk changed the river view room I booked into a queen size bed without my knowledge. When I entered the room and found that the room type was wrong, I realized why the girl at the front desk asked me if I was alone when checking in. It was obvious that no one was with me, and she might have asked to justify giving me a room with a small bed. Then I went to the front desk to negotiate. The reason the front desk gave me was that the hotel was full and there were no rooms. I said that I had reserved the selected room a long time ago. You also know that I will stay in the hotel today and the money has been paid in advance. You should have reserved the room I reserved. It is not an excuse because it is full of tourists. As a world-renowned five-star hotel chain, such behavior is untrustworthy and does not abide by the contract. After many negotiations with the front desk, I agreed to upgrade to a deluxe suite. However, it was not until the evening of the next day that I was able to change to the previously booked room type. The difference was that the executive floor was mentioned.
The coffee machine in the room didn't work the next two mornings. I called the waiter and changed the coffee machine, but it still didn't work. He went back and tried a dozen more coffee machines, all of which were the same. It turned out that the size of the coffee capsules did not match the coffee machine. No one else manages the purchasing depar**ent like this. The room the first night didn't even have a coffee machine. Fortunately, I brought my own hand-brewed coffee, but I really didn’t expect it to come in handy in a five-star international chain hotel.
In addition, because the hotel has been built for a long time, the facilities are a bit old, but this is not the main thing. According to the hotel waiter, the hotel windows have not been cleaned since Shanghai was closed in 2022. The dirty window glass not only affects the view of the river, but also makes people feel bad.

You can see the Huangpu River and half of Shanghai. The price was given to ordinary people a year ago. I want to experience the high-end and a**ospheric environment of Shanghai. It's good choose. The interior of the hotel is also very stylish. It would be better if the food delivery service is strengthened and the pressure-free deposit is better.

Later, when I found out that it was snowing, the snowflakes were in front of my face.
I chose one night to experience it. The Jiulang Jiulang on the 87th floor is very good. It looks very suitable for taking pictures of night scenes. Unfortunately, I didn't sit near the window, but it didn't hinder the photo-taking at all. Two glasses of wine are delicious. ￼I will come again when I have the opportunity.

The suite is not too big, and the overall style of the room is relatively old-fashioned, but fortunately, the service business is good, so the overall feeling still alright.
The little brother who checked in at the front desk was very patient. Because there was a queue when checking out, he gave the room card to a staff member in advance and left after explaining some things. There is no parking fee for staying in the hotel, and you need to make a reservation for swimming (the pool is very small). I didn’t go to the executive lounge for breakfast because there are more food choices in the restaurant on the 56th floor. There are drinks in the small refrigerator for free. The room service speed of the hotel is not bad. The deposit after the room is also very fast.
I want to apologize to the hotel: the child broke the toothbrush cup, because the glass shards are relatively small, so we can't clean all the shards out of the pool, please trouble the aunt who cleans up the hotel later (I also talked to the staff when I checked out I told my aunt to pay attention to safety).

In short, if the child is satisfied, I am satisfied, haha

msg:The problem with the hotel is not that the facilities are old, but the quality and attitude of the service staff are so poor. Having stayed in so many hotels, nothing is more outrageous. First, on the first day of check-in, the child took the room card and opened the door but didn't open it. There happened to be a service staff cleaning the room next to him, so he asked. I tried it and she didn’t try it, but she immediately replied that you have to go to the front desk. Fortunately, I tried again and opened it this time. Second, I asked the service staff for the child’s bathrobe, slippers, and toothbrush. I was given a toothbrush, but there was no reply. Third, I went out. At that time, a female manager in a black suit opened the door of the next room and asked for the child's bathrobe and slippers. She immediately responded and asked me to call the front desk to ask for the child's bathrobe and slippers. I didn't see the child's bathrobe and slippers until I checked out. I put up the Do Not Disturb sign and hung up the Do Not Disturb sign. The next day at nine o'clock in the morning, the service staff shouted loudly and knocked on the door. I answered loudly two or three times and I was still asleep. I still pushed the door open and entered. Fortunately, the door chain was tied and I couldn't break in and continue. I asked loudly if you were still sleeping. After receiving my affirmative answer, he actually asked me when the cleaning would be done. I could only reply that I would call the front desk on Friday. The second night I tried to call the front desk but could never get through to the guest service center. What should I do if no one picks up the phone? The purpose of the hotel service staff is to act confidently and shoulder responsibility. I have encountered so many soft nails and I have never even heard a word of sorry. Haha, I will never choose this hotel again.

Fortunately, the enthusiastic service of the lobby manager, Manager Sun, made us feel a deep sense of warmth. This is the first time The room is not facing the Oriental Pearl Tower. We have some regrets. After going downstairs to the service desk, with the mentality of giving it a try, we asked the manager of Datang if he could help us change to a room facing the Oriental Pearl Tower. The lobby manager checked. Let me tell you that a guest just checked out and changed it for us. When we returned to the changed room, the Oriental Pearl Tower was right in front of us. The girl was so happy, it was a worthwhile trip! We booked a river view twin room with two breakfasts. The fly in the oin**ent is that the current epidemic situation is released, everyone is sunny, and there are too few people staying in the hotel, so the buffet breakfast is not open. The breakfast is packaged by the hotel and delivered to the room. It’s a pity, but I can understand it, and I would also like to thank the lobby manager for sending us another breakfast for free! In general, the landmark building is still worth living in, and it is very convenient to go shopping!

He booked a suite for more than 3,000 yuan per night two days in advance, and the hotel confirmed it. . As a result, when we went to the front desk at 3pm, the customer service said that the room was not tidied up and asked us to store our luggage at the front desk and then go out for a walk. We obeyed. As a result, we went back to the front desk at five o'clock and were told that the room was not ready yet and that we should put our luggage in the guest room and go to eat first. More than two hours were wasted like this. In fact, there was no room that could help us find a solution or upgrade to another room. The TV in the bedroom was not good and I didn’t watch it. I went to the front desk for repairs the next morning. Before I explained the specific situation, the front desk knew that the screen was black. Why not fix it in advance before letting guests stay? This level of management is so poor that I cannot praise it.

On the 54th floor, there is a group of aunts taking pictures every day. Sometimes the sound is loud, and there will be people at the front desk It is very humanistic and rational to communicate politely and not drive away anything.

There were three girls in a row at the front desk, and I chose the girl in the middle who wore glasses. As expected, the glasses matched the glasses, and good luck arrived.

When I asked him about the surrounding sightseeing information, he gave me a detailed introduction to the nucleic acid point under the flyover and the surrounding information. I hope this kind of service will continue to be maintained, and I look forward to coming again next time!

In this regard, in the process of staying in hotels in the past few times, Jinmao Grand Hyatt's service ranks high. No wonder people say that five-star hotels still look for this kind of old-fashioned.

msg:During the epidemic, I came to Shanghai for a business trip. In the vicinity of Lujiazui, there was no negotiated price for business trips for small companies, so I had to choose Ctrip. After looking at the price of the Ritz-Carlton next door, I silently chose Jinmao. The area at the entrance of the taxi is very spacious, there is a doorman, and there is no wink. Maybe all the attention is on the health code of the entering guest, but the concierge after entering is very polite. A person surnamed Wu even helped to press the elevator , I feel like the hotel is serious.
Checked in on the 54th floor, arrived after one o'clock in the afternoon, and there were basically no guests CI. The lady at the front desk greeted her with a smile and her makeup was exquisite. After some enthusiastic inquiries, she was given a room with a view of the Oriental Pearl Tower. I looked at the nameplate, and a lady named Bella, One named Winky deserves praise. Then a gentleman with gray hair swiped the elevator card for me. At this point, the service awareness is very good, and the favorability has suddenly increased.
The view of the room is indeed good, and you can see the Oriental Pearl Tower, which is still very wrong.
The staff in other areas, including guest rooms, restaurants and the gym, are courteous, responsive, and undeniable.

There is a handsome guy named Wu who is very good-looking. He is an old-fashioned hotel. It is much better than the opposite brother hotel, Hyatt on the Bund. If you need a parking ticket when you go out, you can also report your room number and license plate number here, then take the elevator to the 54th floor to check in, and chat with Kevin at the front desk. After learning that the experience in Maoyue is not very good, I specially arranged a nice view for you. View room, take the elevator to swipe the card to the room, the environment is really good, small episode: Although there are many elderly groups on the 54th floor, it is quite noisy, but the impact is not big, the service attitude of the brothers and sisters at the front desk is very good, what I don’t understand, They will explain it patiently. The swimming pool and gym are on the 57th floor. If you want to swim, you have to go to the 57th floor to make an appoin**ent according to their time. It’s good to divide the time. It’s very safe and pretty good. There are nucleic acid points around the building, which is very convenient , I like this hotel very much. I work in Lujiazui. You can calm down and take a look at the surroundings. It's a very good experience. I will come again if I have the opportunity

Service: I came to Shanghai to see a friend who brought two big suitcases. The young man from the concierge on the first floor immediately greeted me and took over the heavy luggage from my hands. thank you very much. This time I specially booked a room with a lounge. Little Goth took me to our administrative building to check in. I passed the front desk all the way up to the 83rd floor. Every hotel employee was so kind and would greet me with a smile. In particular, I would like to talk about the little girl Esther who helped me check in. It was my first time here, she was really professional, and she introduced me in detail about every part of the hotel.

In the end, I would like to say that it is a veteran five-star hotel in Shanghai, and the service is still so good. I will definitely come back again. Like 👍🏼

This time, I brought my designer boyfriend to closely observe the super high-rise building Jinmao Tower completed by SOM and Shanghai Institute.
At the same time, it was to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. This time, the hotel specially upgraded the river view room on the 81st floor for us, and the room number 12 happened to be the date of my boyfriend's birthday. We presented a bouquet of flowers, which was very thoughtful and surprising.
Secondly, the Regency Club experience is also very good. Although there are not many recipes, they are refined. The dishes are replenished in time and the scenery is excellent.
Finally, there is a three-course set menu for two at the Yin Art Restaurant on the 53rd floor. The restaurant is very beautiful and artistic, especially the starry sky roof is very romantic; the waiter Lucas explained it well, allowing us to understand the story behind each dish and the chef. The creative concept of the dishes is rich in layers and delicate in taste, which is very worth experiencing.
This time, I spent a lot of time comparing several five-star hotels in Shanghai, and finally decided to bring my designer boyfriend to experience the super high-rise Jinmao. The reason is also because my boyfriend likes the exterior facade of Jinmao the most in the three-piece suite. design.
A very good staycation, there will be a period in the future.

msg:I stayed at the Grand Hyatt every time I went to Shanghai for Chris**as last December and March this year. I went to Shanghai Disney for Halloween this weekend and also stayed at the Jinmao Grand Hyatt. As a long-established five-star hotel in Shanghai, the hotel does not have the bells and whistles of some of today's internet celebrity hotels. It overlooks the Huangpu River and the Oriental Pearl Tower in the center of Lujiazui. It is really worth it to have such a view when you are in your early 1000s.
Especially this time, the reception by Manager Yu Wei from the customer service center made me feel more at home. I will stay here again next time I go to Shanghai.

When I checked in, my friend’s cheaper room type was directly upgraded to the river view for free. I felt like I was at a loss. It didn't matter, the front desk also introduced the hotel facilities in detail. When I came to the front desk, they didn't say anything and gave me the room card directly. I didn't know which floor the breakfast was on. Later I learned that the mini bar was free, and the quality of the hotel front desk was uneven. No sense of service at all, I won’t come here next time

msg:I really have never stayed in such a bad hotel. It is simply that there is no parking at the entrance of the hotel without guidance, there is no guide sign in the underground garage, and there is no hotel pointing sign when entering the ba*****t. When I checked in, there was no front desk, and a front desk came in a hurry, and the queue was very long. After checking in, I found that the Oriental Pearl Tower could not be seen in the room. I called to ask if I could change the room. The hotel said that we could wait for a while. It was eight o'clock in the evening and we waited to change rooms for dinner. After waiting for an hour and asking four times, I finally slowly said yes. After I finished speaking, I waited another 20 minutes, saying that a staff member took us directly to the new room, but it was too late. We went to the front desk again, and asked We waited without a word of apology. After changing the room, napkins stained with some liquid on the door and window sills were thrown everywhere, and they were not cleaned at all. I was so angry that I changed back to the original room. There was no apology from the hotel during the whole process. The facilities in the check-in room are outdated, and the shower is not well designed. The upper, middle and lower openings are fixed, and it is very inconvenient for girls to wash. Many corners have been rusted, and none of the bedding, paper towels, and toiletries can be called five-star. And the breakfast is also terrible, 200 people are a complete waste. Will never stay in this hotel again.

msg:Thanks from a newlywed couple🙏, the suites reserved in 10.4 are used as rooms for welcoming relatives. After all, there are many concerns about the follow-up requirements of the rooms. Jinmao gave us a big surprise and upgraded us directly when we wanted to check in. It has become a Chinese-style presidential suite, and the area has been upgraded from the original 110 to 170 square meters.
Area upgrade: The original space for hospitality and layout has been enriched a lot, and it is also a lot more joyful to do a small game of welcoming relatives.
Butler caring: The exclusive butler hope configured for us really gave the guests a home-like experience. Not only did they solve the problem of drinking water and rest, delivering breakfast, but also helping us properly arrange the parking of the wedding car, and even paved us with an extra-large size. The red sheets saved us a lot of work.
The night view is too beautiful: overlooking the whole picture of Lujiazui CBD, looking at the Coat International Architecture Expo Group from a distance, I am fascinated by it.
As a pioneer of an established five-star hotel🏨, Jinmao Grand Hyatt may not have as luxurious facilities as the current net red upstarts, but the considerate service and humanized design still warm every guest who comes to stay here. As a native of Shanghai Treasure, I sincerely thank Jinmao Grand Hyatt for everything we have done. I hope this comment can be more valued for hotel services and some guidelines and tips for people who understand the city temperature. Thanks again to Jinmao Grand Hyatt🙏🙏

I entered the elevator to the first floor, and then took the elevator to the 54th floor for check-in. There was no queue that day, but the wait was indeed a bit long! Because the room type is the Regency Club, which has executive courtesy, but there is no welcome fruit after entering the room, and the minibar is also charged. The happy hour executive lounge in the evening has fewer varieties. After eating "grandmother-level duck meat", the next day's breakfast is basically It's a replica of the night 😂, I feel that the hotel has done its best, but the facilities are really outdated! In the middle of the night, I was woken up by "heavy knocks". Due to the outdated facilities, there is no need to "care" too much about the smell of oil smoke in the room! The whole service team is quite satisfactory. You can scan the code to get mineral water, toothbrushes, etc. in the room. Compared with the Chinese food in the art restaurant, the whole service is not bad, and the homemade coffee cheese inside is really delicious! The hotel is suitable for business meetings! Not recommended for families or couples with vacation needs! But the location is really good. The recommended room type for enjoying the view has a "river view". Before picking up the car, be sure to go to the concierge on the first floor to pay for parking!

msg:The 80-story river view room can see the Huangpu River, the Pearl of the Orient, but it is a pity that the Bund cannot be seen, and the moon during the Mid-Autumn Festival cannot be seen. There are no moon cakes or gifts related to the Mid-Autumn Festival. There are few varieties of afternoon tea at Regency Club, two kinds of bread, two kinds of biscuits, melon seeds and peanuts. There are many varieties of drinks. If you go for dinner, there are almost no seats. Later, I went down late, the seats were available, the food could not keep up, and I almost had to grab it...I think it is not the first time that the hotel has encountered a holiday, and the food preparation is not enough. The toilet sink was a bit slow to drain.
Of course, there is nothing to say about the environment. The river view outside the window is worth seeing both day and night. The waiter who cleaned the room was very kind. He took the initiative to give a few more bottles of water and a few pencils to the children. He cleaned it very carefully. He also changed the sheets when he saw the ballpoint pen marks on the sheets.
Overall, it is recommended to stay, that is, the service of Regency Club needs to be improved.

Then I went to have breakfast. Obviously With breakfast, their hotel has not entered the system, and the second breakfast still has not been entered. The most annoying thing is that a coat worth 20,000 yuan was left in their hotel and they forgot to take it away when they checked out. The hotel said they didn't have it? The housekeeper should have taken it away when she was cleaning. Is this the service attitude? I insisted. He said he didn’t take it away, but this time he took away 20,000 coats. What about next time? What about the future? How can you stay in this kind of hotel? Do you still dare to stay? Who dares to stay? Leave something behind and just leave. It’s really a lightning protection. This jacket is just a lesson to spend money on!!! Don’t stay there! The hotel told me that it would be lost and they are not responsible for it….

It was my first time in old Shanghai to spend the night in Pudong. Since Jin Mao Tower was designed by SOM, I wanted to know it up close.
It happened that Ctrip had a favorite product and decided to buy it.
Then I contacted Jinmao Grand Hyatt Hotel, hoping to arrange a room with a pleasant look. Fortunately, I got all the service staff's patient and tireless help, and I was very happy and moved.
The location of the hotel is very good, and life and travel are convenient. Room facilities are also good.
Breakfast is a bit asymmetrical.
The two-night stay and the two-day visit to Pudong were very satisfying.

They have not checked the refund records by themselves, and have been asking the guests to check the collection records. The problem is How can a guest keep calling the hotel if they receive a deposit. The hotel phone is often disconnected, and the communication is often unclear.

The worst is the swimming pool. Due to the building's own reasons, the swimming pool of Jinmao Grand Hyatt is very small and needs to be reserved in advance, if it is a weekend! One hour long.
On the executive floor, due to promotional activities, there are a lot of people, basically taking parents and children on vacation. Therefore, the free snacks at the Regent's Restaurant have more meals and less meals, so it is recommended to give up. There are plenty of restaurants around, and the price is moderate.

In the face of Shanghai's daily screening, I was very worried that I would not be able to make the trip!
God did not let me down with my careful arrangements to make the trip go smoothly and have a good time at the hotel. The enthusiastic reception of the handsome young man in the lobby, knowing that my husband was born on the same day, upgraded the room for both of us! The view and floor (71st floor) are excellent👍, the hotel also specially sent a delicious birthday cake 🎂🎈🌹
The room is large, clean, tidy and comfortable. In the evening, I eat Japanese food on the 56th floor and enjoy the night view of the magic city. The epidemic has changed a lot, but my interest in beautiful food and delicious food remains the same! I especially like the less crowded environment!
Jiuzhongtian has not opened, a little regret, there will be opportunities in the future😄
Before leaving the hotel, I also received the hotel's special dessert~~Dutch cookies🍪 (one of the package contents)

msg:If I could get zero points, I really wouldn't give it one. I can't imagine the work and service attitude of a luxury hotel.
First: I forgot to bring my room card during my stay. Please help me press the elevator button at the front desk. He said he was very busy. When I asked how long it would take, he only gave me the word "long".
Second: I applied for an extension during my stay, and the check-in instructions were very clear to the front desk. However, the room card still expired two days later, so I had to check in again and change the card.
Third: During the check-out period, I specifically requested to check the bill and issue an invoice. However, a few days after leaving the hotel, he called me and told me in a very forceful manner that I was short of money. It was obviously a hotel problem. He was not apologetic at all and was so forceful. It seems that I deliberately skipped the bill. I feel really bad. I don’t have to skip the bill for 200 yuan. The matter is clear and there is no reason not to make up for it. The core issue is your attitude. If there is a higher level complaint channel, please let Ctrip know and I will continue to complain.
Fourth: I left my curling iron in the hotel, and the hotel found that it was automatically stored in the warehouse without any contact with me during this period. They still called me and told me that when I asked about the bill for the room upgrade, they told me that it was indeed left at the hotel. Then I asked the other party to pay me by courier, but the hotel only gave me an Alipay account and did not mention the problem of my missing items at all.
Finally: After verification, there is a price difference for the room upgrade. I will definitely make up the difference, but I really cannot accept the hotel's way of handling the problem. I have always been unwilling to give negative reviews to others, but this time I really can't bear it. I will continue to report to the hotel and Ctrip complained. I have seen in the reviews that many people have been treated with cold trea**ent and unreasonable attitudes. I hope that everyone can actively protect their rights when encountering unreasonable and disrespectful trea**ent.

It may be that the cleaning of the room is in a hurry, and the shopping bag of the hotel cannot be found in the room. 2. Shanghai does not take the initiative to provide environmental protection policies for washing and disposable products. Hard, not the current general soft bristle toothbrush, hope the hotel can change the supplier or toothbrush.

There was still a slight dusty feeling when using the bathtub, so I washed it again before using it. The attitude of the waiter at the hotel front desk was very average, and other services were equivalent to no service.

msg:I went after the Spring Festival and booked 3 rooms.
Arrive at the hotel around 16:50 in the afternoon
When I arrived at the front desk, I was given a waiting ticket with a number on it and said, "Please wait inside." There were many people in the waiting area and I waited for 30 minutes. No one said how much longer I need to wait. I couldn't sit still, so I asked the waiter who gave me the waiting ticket, "How long do I have to wait?" I didn't know it might take 40 minutes. At that time, there were only two windows for processing, which was very inefficient.
When I checked in at around 18:10, there were still many people waiting. Everyone's face was full of exhaustion and dissatisfaction. The hotel did not take any measures and just watched the customers wait and endure. It was not easy to see me. At this time, they could only give me one room and said that there were no other rooms available. "Then when will it be available?" they asked: "I'll call you when the room is available." With this set of operations, all my plans will change. Dinner ended around 20:30, and there was no room notice yet. Why, do you want so many people to use the same room? When you feel like having fun, you immediately go to the front desk to ask about the room. Now you have it, you finally have a room. Thank you, thank you. It’s really hard work. This experience is really bad!

The check-in queue actually took three hours! Then at night, the hotel broke the contract and sold the room to someone else, saying that there was no room left, which was a naked breach of contract. There were not enough manpower, and even the chefs came out to the lobby wearing chef uniforms to act as waiters. It was dumbfounding. After checking in at 10pm, all the power *****s in the hotel were loose and the room was extremely dry and stuffy. After all, it is an old hotel, the hardware has not been updated, and the service cannot keep up. If possible, stay at another hotel at the same price.

After the epidemic, I could only stroll in China. Last year, I went to Xunliao Bay and Shuangyue Bay in Guangdong for a two-week vacation. This year, Shanghai people are not likable. The epidemic has made the whole world famous. Let’s travel locally in Shanghai. The Jinmao Grand Hyatt with the syringe in the three-piece set and the Park Hyatt Hotel with the stirring stick each grab one copy (the boss is engaged in activities) , I went to Jinmao Grand Hyatt this time. I called in advance and made a request to the customer service. If you want to get the room of the Oriental Pearl, you have to check in at 12:30 (you have to take a nap after lunch), all of which are satisfied, haha, I can't add it yet. My money is fine. The service makes you feel at home, with text messages and phone calls before departure, so that you will not forget that all hotel staff you meet at the time of departure are always available. The mattress is moderately soft and hard, and the multiple faucets in the bath have massage effects. You must try it. Souvenirs and welcome drinks (I chose coffee) are good. On the 75th floor of the room (thanks to the handsome guy at the front desk for the upgrade), I enjoyed the charming night view on both sides of the Pujiang River. I also fell asleep happily after watching two free movies in the evening. . The breakfast is a bit simple. It ranks at the bottom of the five-star hotels I have stayed in, but the taste is not bad, the service is also good, and the lack of variety is probably the reason for the epidemic. Three meals a day can be solved at the hotel, and 20% off for accommodation and meals, so I chose Rizhen - a restaurant with a view for lunch. Hee hee late check out at 2 p.m. Happy day trip is over. I will bring my sisters next time.

msg:1. The hotel that cost more than 1,500 yuan a night actually didn’t have toothbrushes and toothpaste. I had to go to the hotel front desk to ask for them.
2. The waiter's attitude was very indifferent. He pretended not to notice when he met me and did not take the initiative to take the luggage.
3. Nowadays, hotels no longer require deposits. This hotel must keep pace with the times.

The service of the hotel staff is also very good. The river view room was upgraded for free, but unfortunately the bathroom leaked. Later, the manager came to help and changed a room. You can see the Oriental Pearl! Children are very happy! It's a pity that the shower in the bathroom of this room is broken... It's inevitable that it's a little inconvenient for children to take a bath. Because it's too late, I didn't find the hotel again. Overall it's very good, I hope the room configuration in the later stage can meet the hotel's positioning ~ except for this small regret, everything else is very good! I recommend everyone to stay

msg:This is a very unpleasant stay experience. It really doesn't deserve the hotel's 1200+ room fee, it's not as good as a hotel with a few hundred yuan. The thing is like this. After we two girls checked in at the store in the afternoon, we entered the room and found that it was a hotel. Connecting rooms. At that time, I felt that the hotel would not be full during this special period. There may not be guests staying next door. Even if there are people staying, the front desk should arrange girls to live next door when making arrangements. It turns out that it is not the case. We put our luggage down. I went out to play, and when I came back to rest at night, the bath water had to be left for a long time before the hot water came out (how long? Probably it took a girl to take off her contact lenses, remove all her makeup, wash her face and put on a mask for so long ), at this time we found that the door of the bathroom could not be closed, and the sliding door had been derailed (it can be said to be crumbling), and we didn’t care too much when we were too tired. We were very sleepy, and we could dance disco in the house as the lights flickered), around 23:15, the guests next door came back, and we could clearly hear them chatting with men’s voices in the push of glasses, and kept Someone was trying to open the door in the middle of the connecting room, and there was the sound of twisting the door handle. We felt unsafe and called the front desk (at 23:20 at this time), the front desk (female) said to change us to another room, and we told her clearly , called us in advance to inform us to prepare, but there was no, after more than 20 minutes (about 23:45), a man knocked on the door and said: The front desk asked me to show you the room, and then we changed clothes and packed things, 0:05 We changed to a new room, the whole thing came to an end, and we were exhausted and speechless. As an ordinary guest, I would like to ask a hotel with such a big brand as Grand Hyatt: 1. Are the facilities in the hotel room not checked? Do you want the guests who are staying to help you check and give you feedback? 2. When arranging the room, should we inform the room situation in advance and ask the guests whether they agree to check in? (I'm sure, when I checked in, the front desk only asked me if the floor on the 74th floor was available, and didn't tell me that it was a connecting room type. After I entered the room, I found that it was a connecting room, but I still believed that the hotel would arrange it properly, but Facts have proved that this hotel does not have the professional and thoughtful service I imagined) 3. The guests are all women. Should the staff who come before midnight also be women or women accompanied by male staff and call the guests in advance? ? In short, apart from occupying a good location in Lujiazui, this hotel has nothing else to offer. . . The price/performance ratio is really not high, you can live better at this price! ! ! !

msg:I really want to complain about Jinmao's grand Hyatt. Although I stayed during the epidemic, there was no discount, and the service was very poor. It can be compared to the second-tier city Jinjiang Inn.


🔔Service: There is no choice for breakfast (not even the most common fried dumplings), it is very similar to a quarantine meal (priced at 268 yuan?)

During the epidemic, everyone bought takeaways, and the hotel didn’t help to deliver them. There is not a single takeout shelf, and it is really hard to get a meal on a rainy day.

The little brother who came out of the parking garage saw that the guests were full of luggage, so he wouldn't help open the door. Instead, he said coldly: What are you here for? !


🧹Hygiene: During the stay, I wanted the hotel to help me collect the finished meal. The waiter who came to the door said that she would not collect garbage, so we should stay in the room or put it at the door... Anyway, help me call someone here...

Price: 3400 yuan/night, with this service, I think it's better to close down!

Staying in Jinmao Grand Hyatt is a peace of mind and peace of mind. During the epidemic, since the restaurant on the 56th floor was closed for breakfast, it was also very considerate to deliver breakfast to the guest room. A few hundred meters away from the door are the Guojin Shopping Center, the Zhengda Plaza, the Oriental Pearl Tower and the Shanghai Center. Shopping is also very convenient! I hope that the Shanghai epidemic will end soon, and the Lujiazui business district will return to its former prosperity as soon as possible!

msg:Since the epidemic, I have really played Shanghai all over. On the eve of Valentine's Day, I specially chose the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Jin Mao Tower, one of the four-piece suites in the center of Lujiazui, to stay for one night to experience the height and beautiful night view of Shanghai.
🚗 Transportation: The hotel is located in the central area of Lujiazui. You can get there by self-driving from the Yan'an East Road Tunnel and turn two turns. Hotel guests need to park their car in the underground parking garage of Jinmao Building, and go out to the concierge on the first floor to report the room number and license plate That's it.
🍃 Environment:
It has been almost 24 years since the hotel opened, and it has been renovated once in 14 years, but it has been well maintained so far. It can be seen that the management of the hyatt group is in place. The hotel environment is very good, belonging to high-end positioning. The room is ok except that the room is a bit stuffy and the bed is not big enough.
🧹Hygiene:
The room is very clean, and the public areas are also well-organized. Although the hotel is very large, there are service staff everywhere.
🔔Service:
The first time I stayed in a hotel, there was a "white coat" for epidemic monitoring and security dog inspection, and I felt very relieved. There are a lot of people for breakfast, and we need to queue up to enter the venue. The supplement is very timely. This time, I also received a panoramic view table, which is very happy.
In general, the price of about 1,000 yuan to live in the Grand Hyatt Lujiazui feels very worthwhile, and I will have the opportunity to brush it again in the future.

msg:Bring a child to stay in room 7520, double bed. The scenery is very good, maybe the epidemic situation, except for the restaurant on the 56th floor, everything else is closed. The breakfast is simple and the soy milk is good.
Problems with the room:
One, the sockets are broken except for the bedside table. The two in the bathroom are also, so the hair dryer has to be taken out to use.
Second, the sound insulation is not good. At 12 o'clock in the middle of the night, the voices of the two people next door kept blasting in my ears, and the children couldn't sleep. Across the wall, I recorded it with my phone. . . I couldn't help but call the front desk. At 2:00 in the middle of the night, the ceiling was still ringing, as if the chairs were always falling over, and it was very broken.
3. There are two breakfasts, but half-price is still charged for the children. Fortunately, I remembered... There is also the so-called gift of anti-epidemic masks that do not exist. It is a small matter, but the details are not as good as Wenhua.

msg:I stayed here again because the last time I stayed at the hotel was very good. This time, I arrived a little early, and this time there were obviously more people staying here. The front desk may have discounted enthusiasm because of the large number of people, so I went to the front. I don't even look up, I can only explain myself to check in, and the front desk replies that I can only check in in the afternoon, but I still didn't look at me. I remember that the last time I checked in was in the morning. A young staff member at the front desk had a very good attitude, politeness and enthusiasm, The difference from this time is quite big, and this time I called in advance to inform my mother-in-law that it was her birthday. I went to the front desk and said that I had not made a note. Although I still sent a cake in the end, I felt that this was the problem of the hotel. Until this time, the summer at the front desk Sir, just looked at me, huh, he helped arrange a room on the same floor, and at last it seemed polite on the surface. When I entered the room, I felt as good as it was, but the outside windows were not very clean. There are also some small hygiene problems. What I need is delivered quickly. The room is quite big. It faces the Huangpu River and can see the Oriental Pearl. It is really beautiful at night. The breakfast the next day is also very rich, Chinese and Western food There are everything, cakes and breads, and many varieties. The waiters in the restaurant are very good. They receive meals on time and respond to requests. Even when I just walked to the drinks area, a passing staff immediately asked me what I needed. Very considerate, this It's a big difference from the front desk who walked up to him on the first day and didn't look up, so the meal was very pleasant, and there was a little problem with the room, that is, the 7717 where I lived, the air conditioner was not too hot, and the electronic scale was broken. , but there is no big problem. Although the overall feeling of this stay is not as good as last time, the children like it and will continue to choose it next time.

msg:Just come to stay for one night and want to experience it. Check-in on the 54th floor, breakfast on the 56th floor, check-in on the 71st floor, and dinner on the 87th floor are all arbitrary decisions.

breakfast:
It's quite satisfactory, there are no surprises, and it is not disappointing. There is a queue for breakfast. The business is so good? Baby under 12 years old, breakfast is half price, breakfast for two adults, Ctrip points exchange, nice

dinner:
My husband had to go to the 87th floor to experience the experience. He said that he wanted to overlook the night view of Shanghai, but it was foggy that night, and there was a little snow. 😄, I went up at 18:00. The front desk of the restaurant said that an appoin**ent was required, and those who did not have an appoin**ent had to wait. Later, the front desk made an appoin**ent. At 19:30, we went back to the room first. When the time was up, the restaurant took the initiative to call and said OK, and we could come up. There is free bread before the meal. I saw the menu price is not expensive, I ordered three main dishes (thinking that the hotel's package style), an ice cream cake, I was shocked when I came up, the portion was mini, and I didn't add any dishes later, and the next table was also A family of three, the little girl celebrates her birthday, and we are also Xiao Mushroom Liang, who are about the same age. They invited us to eat birthday cakes and share their joy. Later, we invited them to drink red wine, Chinese etiquette, and courtesy exchanges 😁, especially, waiter brother The whole performance was very nice

I was thinking about getting up in the morning and having breakfast and going for a swim🏊🏻, but there was a temporary event and I needed to go to Pudong Airport to catch a plane✈️, and I checked out at 10:00 the next morning.

Summarize:
The sky is not beautiful (the weather is good, it may be beautiful to take pictures from the breakfast restaurant), the bed in the big bed room is a bit small, the check-in and morning queue time is a bit longer (usually I don’t know), the atrium of the room looks down and I’m afraid A little bit (fear of heights), others are ok

Arranged high-floor rooms with good views, you can see the panoramic view of the Bund and various high-rise buildings in Puxi, and also sent roses and cakes. The hotel's facilities are also great, the room is big, the furniture and bathroom look quite new. The breakfast is plentiful, especially fruit and desserts (I don't know why there are reviews saying that there is nothing to eat for breakfast?). The gym and swimming pool are very comfortable. Because it is an Internet celebrity hotel, there are many people in the lobby on the 54th floor and the cafeteria on the 56th floor, and many old aunties take pictures, which is a bit noisy.

msg:The epidemic has not left Shanghai for two years. During the holidays, I mainly choose the local hotel tour route. This time I arranged to stay at Jinmao Grand Hyatt for one night.
The security is very strict, and there are good police dogs.
One elevator can go directly to the lobby on the 54th floor for check-in.
Although this is an old-fashioned hotel, the price is very high.
Stay in the highest river view room on the 79th floor, facing the Oriental Pearl, with a wide view
The fly in the oin**ent window glass is a bit dirty.
The internal facilities of the hotel are quite complete.
The charging usb port is a bit slow.
In the evening, you can go around the nearby IFC,
The room overlooks the night view of Lujiazui, and the mood is still very good.
Breakfast is also in the restaurant on the 56th floor, and there are more Western choices than Chinese ones. Overall a pleasant experience. Suitable for staying with family.

msg:I had the opportunity to order the package of Jinmao Grand Hyatt Hotel on the Ctrip App. It should be said that the price is relatively affordable. I made an appoin**ent to stay on weekends. Jinmao's epidemic prevention is relatively strict. There are not only big white guards on the ground floor, but also security guards with police dogs to check. The 54th floor is the lobby of the hotel. There is a queue for check-in, but the speed is quite fast, and it will be your turn in a while. The hotel gave me a room on the 76th floor. Although it is not the best viewing position, the scenery is still good. Although the room is traditional Chinese style, it is relatively ordinary but very clean. The grade of furniture materials is good. There is a bathtub and a shower, and the shower is the kind of combination that can be adjusted according to your needs. The window of the room cannot be opened, so it is hot when there is sunshine. In this season, it seems that the hotel does not have air-conditioning. It will be hot after staying in the room for a long time, which will affect sleep at night. Maybe it will improve after turning on the air-conditioning. . The buffet in the hotel is relatively rich, Chinese and Western styles are distributed on the left and right sides. There are many varieties and quality, especially fruits, such as red heart pomelo, yellow orange, passion fruit, star fruit and so on. The swimming pool of the hotel is not big on the 57th floor. The two swimming lanes are only about ten meters in length. The water is not very clear. There are many children on weekends, but there is a hot spring pool to soak in. The western restaurant on the 87th floor of the hotel has a good night view. The dishes are okay, but the quantity is a little smaller. It would be better if it was arranged on the side of the Oriental Pearl. All in all, the experience of staying at the Grand Hyatt was very pleasant.

They changed the room that night. The variety of breakfast is quite rich, even if there are many people staying, whether it is check in or breakfast, there is a queue.

        Yesterday was New Year's Eve, and we chose this Jinmao Grand Hyatt Hotel for a one-night stay.
         What I didn't expect was that there would be such a long line at check-in. This was the first time I encountered it. It felt like I was checking in at the airport and queuing for 45 minutes to arrange check-in. Everyone thought that due to the epidemic, they could not travel far, and many locals came here. Fortunately, the hotel has opened a lot of windows, and the service staff are working overtime. Thank you for your hard work 👍💐!
         Saw some bad reviews online, but I feel good about my stay! Although it is an old hotel, the facilities and hygiene are OK. Especially love their shower room!
         I booked a room with a river view and the view is also very beautiful!
         Although there is a queue for breakfast and there are many people, the management is good and there is no confusion.
         Overall, it feels good and worth living.

There are a lot of mosquitoes and flies in the restaurant. The most outrageous thing is the changing of clothes in the swimming pool. I made a reservation for an early morning swim, but the shower in the locker room was full of cold water, and there was no waiter. The air conditioner was blowing on my wet swimsuit. Later, I asked the cleaning lady who showed up and said that the temperature set by the engineering depar**ent was cold. Alas! All in all, I feel that the service and facilities are far different from those of a five-star hotel.

The security guard refused to let me park and told me to go to the lobby on the first floor to get my card and park there. I made a long circle to the lobby on the first floor of the hotel. The staff said there was no such rule and I drove straight there. Just stop. I said the security guard wouldn’t let me stop, but he also told me to go to 54 to check in first, and then asked me to try again. I was really speechless! Secondly, when it was past 11 o'clock in the evening to check in, there were only two staff members, and there were four or five guests in line in front of them. Couldn't the hotel add more staff members to check in? It’s been a long time coming! Finally, the scariest thing is that in the room I checked in, there was half a bottle of mineral water that someone else had opened and drank. I almost let my child drink it. Later, I asked the customer service and they said they would give me a room with a different view than my room. Room, I'm really speechless. Can't the cleaning attendant see the bottle of mineral water that someone else drank? What if my child drinks it? Since I want to change rooms, why do I want to change to one with a view that is not as good as mine? It’s really bad to the extreme! Anyway, I will never go there again!

I went on Thursday, and there was still a queue for a while to check in at three o'clock. The service can only be said to be average. The room fee and deposit were charged a total of 2000. The check-out deposit was not refunded in time, which is not good!

msg:I have stayed in many hotels, but Jinmao Grand Hyatt's room design details are amazing. The combination of marble, metal, glass and mirror makes the room show a simple, rational and low-luxury style, while the warm-colored wooden background wall and double sliding doors are soft The toughness brought by the materials mentioned above has been melted, and it has played a good balance. As for the buffet breakfast is quite satisfactory, there are some, there are not too many features. If the weather is good, I really recommend staying at this hotel for one night.

msg:The environment and check-in experience are very good. After all, Jinmao is our childhood memory in 31010. This time, the whole family stayed for one night on the fourth day of the ***** New Year. The experience was great. The Diplomat 8118 room type has everything a must-have. Two points of dissatisfaction: 1. The check-in front desk service at the Grand Club on the 83rd floor was very good, but the meals provided in the rest area were too few, which was against the hotel's standards. The waiters were indifferent, which was not a good feeling at all. 2. Dinner is buffet on the 56th floor. It’s understandable that you can’t buy coupons for discounts during the Spring Festival, but I think it’s a bit excessive to increase the price by nearly 40%. The food is average and there are no high-end ingredients, so you can just eat enough. The red and white wine can be drank freely, and the restaurant service is very good. Well, Shanghainese are all happy to communicate.

msg:First of all, the location of Jinmao Hyatt Regency is very good. The road is directly west of Shanghai Tower, and it is directly south of the World Financial Center. It can be reached in two or three minutes. Lujiazui Diamond Grade C, Golden Triangle. There are five doors in the building, three of which are the hotel and the other two are the sightseeing entrance on the 88th floor. On the ground floor, there are anti-epidemic white and police dogs guarding, check the anti-epidemic code. When I checked in on the 54th floor, the lady who handled it was kind. I booked two different room types for two days, and she did all the work together, saving me the trouble of queuing the next day, and handing over to the next day's successor colleague. Help me with my luggage and transfer it directly to the next room. Like this kind of reception. There are six restaurants above the 55th floor. I chose two places for dinner, Cantonese and Japanese. The location is excellent, just outside the window is the Bund and Shanghai Center. The taste is good, and the price is not cheap. Also swim and exercise on the 57th floor. The fly in the oin**ent The sound insulation effect between the rooms is average, and if you listen carefully, you can vaguely hear the movement and sound of the next room. On the first day of the festival, the check-in time was arranged for exactly one hour, and the window was opened enough to call for a number. For breakfast, you also need to queue up to call the number and wait for the restaurant staff to take you to a designated seat to take a seat. The night view is beautiful. Overall stay satisfied.

From getting the number to going to the front desk and queuing up again, it took a full hour. I took the number at a certain There was only bottled water while waiting in the lobby... and there wasn't even a place to sit in the first place. Secondly, after finally checking in, I was told that there were only rooms on the 59th floor. They said the floor was not high but the view was good. Okay, let’s believe it. However, I was completely devastated after entering the room. There was dust on the windows. The scenery I promised was great...it was all ruined by the glass windows. Finally, let’s talk about the room, not to mention the equipment. They are all a bit old, the bathroom sink is super small, and the shower water has no water pressure... I forgot about these. The sound insulation is very poor when sleeping at night! ! ! The voice of the uncle next door only comes through the wall! I can only say that the price of this hotel has exceeded the service itself, so the price has been reduced! !

The hotel service is really top-notch. From the strict anti-epidemic security check on the first floor to the reception on the 56th floor, you will greet you when you come in and out, and you feel like you are home. This time I booked the 71st floor landscape room and you can see the Huangpu River.
The room is large, although the facilities are a bit old, but the cleaning is very clean. My favorite is the landscape bathtub🛁

I didn't pay attention at first because I was busy taking care of the elderly and children, but I found out after checking the account. I called and asked, and the hotel admitted it (if I didn't find out by myself, I would have lost hundreds of dollars for no reason), then you just have to pay back the money, and the money was delayed from January to March! Complaints and calls to 12315 are nothing to do with this hotel. It is an understatement to go through the financial process, dare to ask if the guests staying in your hotel can delay paying the room fee for two months? Guests can also say that they want to go through the financial process! You have to wait in line for three hours to check in without any discussion. The service is poor, the quality is bad, and there is also a problem with character. You have to ask for money and have not paid it back. It is undoubtedly the best garbage hotel!

msg:Because of the epidemic, I can't fly abroad and take my parents to stay in a hotel in Shanghai for Chinese New Year.
I don't know if it's because of lack of manpower or what, I'm going to complain:
1. Check in at 2 pm on New Year's Eve. The hall is full of people, and the queue is not obvious. You should set up a sign at the place where the elevator comes out, instead of sending a staff member to identify whether it is a check-in or not. Check-in guests, although there is a number issued but no number is called, it is purely to see if it is their turn. After waiting for more than 50 minutes, the room does not have to choose any floor for you.
2. The breakfast is still messy. The first time I saw the queue, I went downstairs to eat at 9:00 in the morning. I was shocked when I got out of the elevator. The queue has already started to circle. There are actually a few tables that are placed in the dark side and corner to eat, and the crowd in line is only 5cm away from the table, which is not an exaggeration. We waited for about 40 minutes before we got in the queue, and then we realized that the people who were eating had to be brought in. The seats were stipulated and the tableware was stipulated to prevent people from mixing meals, but no one explained when they were queuing up. The internal service staff said that there are fewer people around 8 o'clock. Now it is peak at 9 o'clock. We went to eat at 8 o'clock in the next two days. The quality of the breakfast is ok, both Chinese and Western styles are available, and the coffee pouring at the bar is a bit confusing and jumping in line.
The hotel was built in 1999 and the decoration is a bit old fashioned but well maintained. The air conditioning and heating are very good, and the bath water is also large and the water temperature and water pressure are very stable. The room service is good, the phone is always on call, and the cleaning aunt is very polite. Stayed for 3 days, very quiet and good sound insulation
I don’t know if the hotel has people who come to review the reviews. It is recommended that you make some adjus**ents and improvements at the front desk and the dining place. When you check in, you can friendly remind you to avoid the peak time period, set up reminder signs, and get a box when you check out. Or the look of a mailbox instead of a manual card collection.
The feeling on the first day was really bad. It's hard to imagine that this is a high-end hotel in Shanghai. Now it is during the epidemic. I really don't know what the Shanghai World Expo was like.
In short, I chose you for the first time I stayed in a Shanghai hotel, but the experience was really bad. Although the service staff were very polite, I hoped for improvement. After all, you represent the height and fame of Shanghai.

I don’t know if there are usually no people coming Staying here, there is no filing measures at all during the Spring Festival. The waiters feel like temporary workers. It takes five or six people to serve breakfast to clean up the table for four. The speed is really slow. You can ask the waiter a question. You can ask three questions. The waiter enters and exits the elevator without saying hello. Forget it, rushing in and rushing in completely disregarding the feelings of the guests, there are a lot of problems like this.

The breakfast in the executive suite is on the 83rd floor. I was shocked when the cat mother said that there were very few things. I got up and tried it myself the next day. I was really shocked.

msg:I really never give negative reviews to people. First of all, the scenery is very good and the front desk service is also good, especially the male manager. The first impression is very good and he is very polite and polite.
But Grand Hyatt's takeout service really disappoints me.
First of all, there is no takeout point downstairs. I live near the 70th floor and the signal is very poor. It is impossible for customers to squat at the door before the takeout arrives. The delivery boy called me when he got downstairs and said that they wouldn't let me leave at the door, not even for a short while, so he had to leave.
So I stood at the door for 10 minutes under the scorching sun, because the order was about to time out, so I had to go to a nearby place to deliver it first. The security guard at the door had an evasive attitude and walked away when I raised questions.
After the takeaway boy came for the second time, the security at the door did not allow his car to park at the door. The boy could only run over from a distance while wiping his sweat. This is also something that I don't understand very much.
I have stayed in no less than 20 hotels of similar price range in Shanghai, and I have never encountered a hotel that did not allow the guy to deliver things to the door. What's more, the door itself is open to traffic. Everyone is equal and it's not easy for everyone. There is no need for the little brother to stop so far and run over twice, and go back and forth twice. It can be more humane on such a hot day. There should be better communication between management and execution and not cause any trouble.
Secondly, I understand that it cannot be placed at the door to affect the appearance, but at least you can give a clear instruction. On such a hot day, it is very hard for the delivery boy to run back and forth, and it is the same for the customers waiting outside.
Of course, the hotel staff told me that there was one on the B1 floor, but the elevator in Jinmao was originally inaccessible, so I walked a long way to get my things. I stayed here for three days and it was troublesome to get takeout every time. I hope more attention can be paid to improvement.

The room is a big bed; very spacious, comfortable and bright; air conditioning and heating are sufficient! The bathroom is clean; the wet and dry separation is great! The shower 🚿 is very comfortable and the design is also very good! The toilet flush button is not very good! Toiletries are also very complete (that is, there is no disposable comb; other hotels will keep it; this is not satisfactory)
The hotel breakfast is still very satisfactory; there are many varieties in the central and western areas and the taste is also very good! Overall it was a good stay experience!

msg:The hotel environment and view are excellent. Because I checked in on my birthday, I also got a free upgrade to the big bed room with a river view, and sent flowers and cakes, which was super heartwarming.

The next time there is a chance to stay, the hotel's price/performance ratio is very high. I also recommend it to foreign friends!
