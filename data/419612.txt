which is just on the opposite side of the road. But the hotel is quite timeworn and really needs an important renovation. To be a Jumeraih hotel this is quite disappointing. The breakfast is fine but the coffee machine hasn’t the cappuccino or macchiato option, it just can make coffee than the waiter told me that if I want cappuccino I need to add milk by myself.

The very special mention is for Jessica from the front desk who was of immense help in terms of room arrangements, the upgrading , pulling our luggage by herself and with her sweet smile to name a few. Overall , our staying in the hotel room was comfortable enough with all the extra facilities. We were very happy and will come there and recommend others too. thanks very much.

msg:Nice hotel with rustic wood flooring.  The office desk was massive and built into the wall.  The shelf above the desk had a beautiful vase to add to the relaxing decor.  The tv shelf was a floating shelf which means it's attached to the wall instead of resting on table legs.  This is great because some people can accidentally bump their feet on the TV cabinet.  There was a sitting area with a couch and beautiful glass coffee table by the window looking out on an amazing aerial view of the convention center across the road.  The bed was very comfortable and warm.  The pillows were the perfect softness.  The bathroom had a wonderful tub, separate shower/rain shower, and separate toilet with emergency phone.  The bath mat was a wonderful, soft, fur-like bath mat.  Normally hotels just have a special towel for the floor, so the soft bathmat was awesome!  Will definitely recommend this hotel, and I plan to visit again in the future.

msg:This hotel has clearly already entered the COVID period badly and now that it is over, this can be noticed in everything. The breakfast is not international, promised facilities (club lounge) and associated room are offered, but have not been in function for more than 3 years. There is not enough staff, it is very outdated and in my opinion it does not reach 3 stars, but they do charge 5 star prices. 1 coffee (dirty) machine during breakfast already shows a lot. The only advantage is that the hotel is a reasonable distance from the entrance to the exhibition buildings. But it doesn't matter. If I no longer have to, I would never want to sleep here again.

Apart from all this, the hotel offered by trip.com includes the option to book a room on a club lounge floor and associated service at a very 5 star price. This was not available and after I had accepted my room, both the hotel and trip.com appeared to have difficulty reimbursing the room rate that my colleague paid without that service. Ultimately, after a lot of back and forth emails and expensive phone calls that I had to receive in Shanghai, we reached an agreement, but I still have a bad feeling about what this has left me with!

It’s a nigh**are 🚫🚫🚫 experience‼ ️‼ ️‼ ️
Reception problem: I brought a lot of luggage to the hotel lobby but no one paid attention to it. I had to run around to the front desk in the corner to ask this and that before anyone started to receive me.
Problems at the front desk: inconsistent speech, unprofessional attitude, and no basic respect for guests. The first place to shirk responsibility.
In the morning, he said that the room could be canceled because the guests could not be seen in the mirror. In the evening, he started to say strangely: "I never said that. The confirmation code he wrote on the note asking me to communicate with Ctrip is still there." He also said it was not his responsibility.
In the evening, I asked the front desk to send things to my friend's room and asked me to find the concierge. The concierge said again that he had to go to the front desk! In the end, the front desk sent me something and called me to confirm again. Everyone in the room answered the call, and I called my friend on the spot to answer the call, but she was told that she didn't answer. If the guest wasn't in the room, wouldn't she be sent? As a result, it took a long time and ten minutes to deliver it.
Shirking responsibility, making excuses for being unprofessional in business? Communication in English is zero and unwilling to communicate in English with foreign customers‼ ️‼ ️‼ ️

Lightning protection‼ ️Lightning protection‼ ️Lightning protection‼ ️ I will never choose any store in this hotel again🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫

At first, they lied and said it was a problem with the air conditioner.

Although it is a bit out of the way, it is still convenient to have the subway. The exterior design is modern, the hotel lobby is Chinese-style, the buffet dinner and breakfast are not good, but the service is satisfactory. The staff is friendly, the room is clean and tidy, and the sound insulation effect is good. Having said that, I will make some suggestions on the details. First, the glass partitions in the bathroom and bedroom area, as well as the glass in the toilet area, although frosted, are too transparent and have no effect at all. They can only be suitable for couples; second, the shower area blocks The water sill is not high enough and the bath water easily overflows; the third shower head cannot be adjusted up or down or the mode; the glass door of the fourth shower area actually opens inward, and there is a small shelf on the inner wall. But it protrudes too much, and it is easy for a slightly larger person to bump into it if he opens the door inwards or carelessly takes a shower. The coffee table and round stool in the fifth room are also small at the top and large at the bottom. The irregular shapes are easy to hit the legs when passing by. Please pay more attention to the above details. Improvement will be more perfect

The lobby has no air conditioning, and it feels dark and cold every time you walk in. The revolving door never opens, and you have to push the heavy side door by hand every time to enter and exit the hotel. It gives people a feeling of going bankrupt.
The room cost more than 1,000 yuan a night, and I didn’t get a bottle of drink in the small refrigerator after renewing the room twice.

Why did I choose your hotel and book it on Ctrip? I feel like eating a fly. The customer service is awesome. Yes, I hung up the phone faster than you. There was no politeness in what I said. It was all about what you want to do, what you want to do, no, I can’t control it, and you can choose who to call wherever you go.
My request was to book a hotel for the company leader. After the reservation was made, the itinerary changed and I needed to cancel. I called the hotel to ask for help in agreeing to cancel. This was a mistake for them to take advantage of. Give it to me. You are criticizing me. I said I can honestly say that I have used Ctrip to book hotels for 8 years, and your family is the first to refuse to cancel, and the service quality is the worst. I hope you can adjust quickly. No matter how much money you pay or how good it is, I won’t look at your hotel again.

It’s hard to imagine what would happen if you accidentally fall... There is a chandelier next to the sink, which is even more speechless. I bent down to wash my face. It will hit your head... For people who stay in hotels on business trips all year round, this is the most speechless hotel. Don't believe in any "designer hotel". This designer is here to fight against humanity!

As for how great it is You can only experience it when you live in it. If you live in Shanghai, you can consider it as a weekend vacation choice, and you don’t have to go to Disney to be crowded. The time is good, you can take the maglev train from the hotel to Pudong Airport within 30 minutes via Longyang Road Station, and you can experience it yourself this time. Leave the hotel at 7:00 in the morning and take the maglev train from Huamu Road Station to Longyang Road Station at 7:20 , 7:28 to Pudong

Looking at the emptiness outside the window, the comfort of the mood is better than the oppression of the high-rise buildings in the downtown area. Relax in the bathtub at night, close the thoughtful blackout curtains, and the soft big bed makes me, a person who is serious about beds, fall asleep like a baby. The TV can receive CNN, Russian Today, Phoenix News, etc. Passengers from various countries who pay attention to current affairs can also obtain information from different positions during their vacations and business trips. ￼Special thanks to Molly, the big beauty at the front desk, who works swiftly and patiently, and has a tenacious and capable smile that is always on her lips.

The security guard casually dismissed me and had to drive out of the hotel and go around to the underground parking garage at the back. I questioned why the entrance to the hotel's underground garage with signage was closed, and why guests could be sent around to drive out of the hotel and then park elsewhere in the so-called prescribed places. The hotel's lobby manager was extremely rude and said that just follow the security guidelines. Treat guests as you please, without any sense of service. They also told me that their hotel is not a star hotel in the first place, and they never said that their hotel is a high-end hotel. Then I want to question how Ctrip rates hotels. When I booked the hotel, I chose it after seeing the five-diamond hotel mentioned by Ctrip. It turned out that it was not fun to spend money on it, which was extremely outrageous! I have never encountered a luxury hotel with extremely poor service attitude and extremely unreasonable facilities. It is really unprecedented for the lobby manager to treat guests like this!

One of the children needs to pay extra for breakfast. The price is half price, one hundred and ten. Look at the pictures and feel for yourself. Will not stay again next time.

Now that it has been ruined like this, the former owner must cry and faint in the toilet. Jumeirah should also take back the management rights as soon as possible, this hotel will smash this golden signboard:
- The hotel is not as dirty as the average Samsung
- Expensive hardware is not interesting to maintain
- Staff have no sense of service

It is an advantage to be close to the exhibition hall, just walk across the road. But it is estimated that this is the reason, the hotel should not lack customers, so the service is not so careful. There is no problem in the room, but I hope that the service and efficiency of the front desk can be improved. The front desk feels that it is always too busy or in a hurry to deal with it. As long as the needs of the guests can be quickly dismissed, it will not make people feel that they are really thinking of the guests. Of course, if it is only regarded as an express hotel, it will be This has passed, so it depends on the expectations of different people.

msg:I decided to place an order temporarily because I found that the cost performance of direct booking one night in advance is still very high. I didn't have high expectations, so the result was a little bit better than expected.
First of all, it turned out to be a parent-child room with two beds. The room is big enough, complete with children's products, including slippers, bathrobes and toiletries.
Secondly, a puzzle and a cup were given away. I thought there was only one schoolbag, and I also gave 40 game coins. I caught a potato cocoa after playing a few times. What a surprise.
Again, the milk in the afternoon tea is very fragrant, and my baby drank all the cup, and the buffet in the evening is also very rich, with a lot of Southeast Asian, Japanese food, and seafood.
Finally, although the swimming pool is not big, the hot pool in the locker room is very comfortable, the sauna room is also available, and the dryer is very practical, but the shower faucet in the locker room is too hot and cold to control.
The only regret during this trip is that I didn't notice the blackout curtains before going to bed, and I didn't get a good rest all night because of the light pollution and the quilt noise caused by turning over every time. During the day, I found out that there were blackout roller blinds, but I still didn't know how to use them.

Be patient; after breakfast the next day, when I went to pick up my companions, the parking security came over and impatiently called me to leave, saying that a bus was coming. I began to bear it, and said I would leave in a few minutes. He started to be aggressive and had a bad attitude. He cursed at me and wanted to hit me. I was in a hurry and my friend made it a big deal and made it a trivial matter and left. After calling the complaint, the hotel told me that the security at the door was an outsourced team. , I have responded to it, and after follow-up, I know that there is no result. I went to pick up my luggage and check out at noon. I parked outside the gate. As soon as I parked, the security guard at the gate impatiently asked me to leave. Moreover, where I parked, there was a business car parked on the right side of the gate. Why can others park but we can't? Stop, I was in a hurry to go to the high-speed rail station and moved my location obediently. From check-in to check-out, the security guard at the hotel had a very bad attitude and the hotel did nothing to deal with it.

The staff who received the call said contemptuously that they didn't find the order and shirked responsibility and asked me to find a platform. The tone of communication throughout the whole process seemed to say "looking for What am I doing, I'm forcing you to stay here." When I checked in later, there was no order status as the aunt on the phone said. I sincerely hope that the hotel will train the service staff well! After all, the pricing is here, and the service must follow! !

msg:The hotel is not new, but the service is still in place. From the time of check-in, I gave the lobby manager Mike a good review, gave the doll catch coins, and gave enough consumables in the room. Because of the epidemic, the drama in the package was cancelled, and a Tudou Duoli themed schoolbag was added. The afternoon tea tastes good. The temperature of the swimming pool is 28°C, not cold at all, enough for children to go in. Fortunately, there is a bathing pool at 40°C in the changing room, so you can warm your whole body after soaking. Buffet dinner and buffet breakfast, although not too much, are enough. The price/performance ratio is good.

First of all, the reservation at the front desk has been upgraded. The room is large, beautiful, tidy, and the details are in place. The bedding is very comfortable. Then the seafood for dinner is of good quality, which is delicious. Century Park, which is a few meters away... successfully concluded this happy anniversary event, and I will go again next time.
Thank you very much Himalaya Restaurant, and wish your business will be prosperous in the new year after the epidemic is lifted.

For a hotel with the same price, it can really be said that the experience is poor... and there are no staff at the entrance of the hotel. Active guidance, relatively indifferent, I think this is also a five-star hotel, the service is not as enthusiastic and active as 4 stars, it can be said that it is very disappointing, I was looking forward to it before coming, but the advantage is that the front desk staff is ok, and they have upgraded the room type , the room is very spacious, I really hope to improve it...

2. Parking is inconvenient. Not to mention the third ba*****t floor, most of them are mechanical parking spaces, your car is slightly wider and you can’t get in at all.
3. The service is too bad. The cleaning did not replenish the body wash in time every day, and it took a full 15 minutes for the child to take a bath at the front desk to deliver the body wash
4. The breakfast is too poor. The breakfast at 231 yuan per person does not have the quality that a five-star buffet breakfast should have. The fruit is not replenished in time, the goblet for drinking juice is dirty, and the pile of scum on the tablecloth is not cleaned up.
In short, choosing Jumeirah Himalayas during the May Day holiday is the biggest failure! ! ! The travel experience is greatly reduced. Don't choose another hotel if you really avoid lightning. I will give this hotel three stars at most

I like the pavilion in the lobby very much. Someone just got married. The bride is wearing a golden wedding dress, which matches the color of the pavilion!
The package with breakfast, afternoon tea and dinner bought this time is very cost-effective. It is upgraded to a parent-child suite of Tudou Duoli. If you live for a long time, you still need a larger room to be more comfortable.
Puzzles and cups were also given, and drinks in the refrigerator were free on the first night. By the way, the spare parts have finally been replaced by Yuebi Shi, and finally it is no longer Westgar.
The room can see the three-piece suit far away. Also gave Himalaya tickets to visit the Ukiyo-e exhibition. Really great value!
The salmon roll for afternoon tea is especially delicious! The quality control of winter jujube is good, and each one is very sweet! It's a pity that the waiters at afternoon tea, especially the waitresses, have a super cold attitude, which is not very good.
The hot pot for dinner is especially good. As a hot pot control, there is nothing more exciting than a hot pot meal. If not, three meals! The waiters in the restaurant, boys and girls are very good!

msg:Originally wanted to give 5 points, but the restaurant experience is really bad
The location of the hotel is good, opposite the International Exhibition Center, very close, the entrance is the subway entrance
[Front desk] The service is very good, the processing speed is fast, the coordination of the room is also very considerate, and the explanation is clear
[Room facilities] A bit old, but very clean, the bathroom is super large, the dry and wet are separated, there are showers and bathtubs, but the frosted glass has no blocking effect, it is a bit embarrassing to stay with children
[Gym] The design and layout of the swimming pool is a bit unreasonable. The men's changing room is about 10-20 meters away from the entrance of the swimming pool. When you walk out of the water to the changing room, it is a bit cold, and the ground is easy to get wet. It is also suitable for guests who use fitness equipment. unsafe
[Restaurant], the Wagyu beef buffet for dinner is not bad, except that it is very hot and sweaty, the dishes are ok.
Breakfast, uh~ it's really a bit poor. The peak summer season is coming to an end, and the restaurant is still a little busy. I went to eat after 9 in the morning, the bread itself was sliced toast, and the butter was gone. I didn't wait for it to come twice. Coffee The machine actually ran out of water at the end. There was only one kind of wide noodles for the noodles, and only one kind of vegetarian chicken for the topping. No juice was found. For those who don’t drink milk and coffee, they can only drink ice water. Very difficult, the restaurant is still very hot, so hurry back to your room after eating. . . Too much ranting

msg:We stayed at the Himalaya Hotel three years ago, and we were very satisfied. The bedding was very comfortable, and the breakfast was delicious. Today, three years later, we are still satisfied to stay again, but this time we are very disappointed. The facilities have not changed, neither good nor bad, but the air conditioner is not hot. We drove the car all day and wanted to take a bath for the children. The solution is to call the front desk and tell the front desk that it is in energy-saving mode before 6 o'clock, and the temperature of the air conditioner will be turned up after 6 o'clock. My God, a five-star hotel is actually like this now. Well, we will wait, wait until I tried it again at 6 o’clock and it still wasn’t hot, so I called the front desk again. The maintenance personnel came after a while and took a temperature measuring gun to measure the air. The temperature was 24 degrees. I said there was nothing to do with it. To bathe the children, there is no Yuba or heater in the bathroom. The staff said that it was the temperature of the central air conditioner. Now that there are few people, it is in energy-saving mode during the day, and the temperature will be raised at night. For the first time, I felt weird. Five-star hotels still limit the temperature of the air conditioner. The variety of breakfast is not as rich as before, needless to say, there are fewer people. I want to say that the hotel industry is not very good under the current epidemic situation. You are saving money like this, but we will not choose to stay next time. We should think more about how to open source

The style of the hotel is more national style and is specially designed for children There is also a shadow play and a doll machine in the Potato Dolly Room, but the child said that she was not interested in this Dolly, so she booked a normal big bed room. The hotel only gave one room and said that the other room had not been cleaned and was thinking about going. Let's take a swim first, but I forgot to wear a swimming cap and can't go into the swimming pool. The bathroom has a small bubble pool and a few saunas. In an hour and a half, I specially booked the room on weekends. There will be a self-service counter in the room. You can get some vegetables, snacks, seafood, etc. After eating, and the children's gym shakes the circle to digest the food, the overall is not bad.
On the second day, because it happened to be the fifth day of the new year, there was a lion dance and a welcome to the God of Wealth for breakfast, which was quite a Chinese New Year a**osphere.

1. The elevator to the underground parking garage only operates during the period of 8 am and 8 pm. It is not open after this time. On the day we checked in, we went out and came back. It was raining at 9 o'clock in the evening. Just put the car in the underground bar and pay the parking fee, but I can't go to the elevator. The elevator is out of service. There is a sign at the door saying that if you need to go to the hotel, please contact the following number. Our elevator is out of service and asked us to drive the car on the ground and enter the hotel from the ground, then you can't write clearly what to write on the ground. Fee is speechless
2. There is no manual delivery or robot delivery when ordering takeout. Even the takeaway is not allowed to put the food on the table at the door. We must call the front desk to inform the front desk before the takeaway can put it on the table.
3. The attitude of the front desk staff when checking in is also very general. They don't want you to stay. Why do you want to check in and increase my workload?
In conclusion, don't live at this price. Where can you live?

The matching washroom smells good white tea, and the capacity is also large. If you can't use it up, you can take it home. It's a pity that the executive lounge is closed, but the hotel Chinese restaurant has pulled back the score. The taste is good, the price is reasonable, and the portion is suitable.

All the five-star reviews were given to the day shift manager at the front desk (sorry forgot to ask your surname) and the night shift manager Zhang, who was already the restaurant manager on the first floor. After some small episodes, these three managers helped me solve the problem quickly and attentively. Thanks, because the last two weekends of the summer vacation and the staff are already overloaded, it is really not easy to do this. Thank you for giving us good memories, just for this service, and will continue to check in Juomei in the future! !

I recommend booking an executive room, which is really much more comfortable than a queen room and not too expensive. The gym is great and there are few people. There is a Michelin restaurant in the building and it is delicious. The lighting of the hotel is dim and it may be uncomfortable at first, but after staying for a few days, the lighting is very comfortable. The room cleaning is also very good and there is a shoe shine service.

There are not many places for children to play. If more interactive activities can be added, I believe that more people will like it [happy]. The service staff are very nice, especially Fiona, who was very attentive when checking in. Because of the package purchased, the little girl wrote the key points on the room card to facilitate memory. There are two beds in the parent-child room, but the bathroom is made of glass, which is a little inconvenient for older children, after all, they still need privacy.

At the entrance, there is a dragon boat made of red sandalwood with large leaves, a thousand-character script, a big stage, and the decoration is beautiful and festive. We upgraded to an executive room, the room facilities are luxurious, the room is large, simple and elegant, and the stay is comfortable.

msg:I chose to stay at this hotel for the weekend because of their family room and family program, Michelin restaurant, and close to Century Park.
As soon as I got to the hotel and gave me 20 tokens for the doll machine, my husband helped Dabao draw a doll, but he spent 100 yuan to help Erbao draw a doll.
That day, the public is not beautiful, and can only mix in the hotel. The window cannot be opened in the hotel, it is very, very hot, the mattress is very thick, we did not turn on the air conditioner, the children are sweating profusely during the day, and it is too hot to sleep naked at night.
There are two large and one small beds in the parent-child room, with a set of sheets and a pair of children's slippers, nothing special. Although the mini bar is free, it's all Coke and two bottles of super sweet juice, and I didn't eat anything.
At noon, I went to Mystery Shanghai for dinner. The dishes did not step on the thunder. The beef cheeks and vegetable cakes were my favorites. The children only like to eat dim sum, scallion pancake + fried buns for 2 dim sums for 100 yuan are gone. There is also a service charge, which is not cheap.
The highlight is the parent-child activity shadow play + handicraft in the afternoon, and afternoon tea with many small cakes. The kids were very happy to eat and play.
In the evening, the beef sukiyaki pot for buffet dinner was not bad. I went back to my room to watch TV for a while, soaked in the bathtub and went to sleep. To be honest, it was too hot to sleep well!
The hotel has free parking, a swimming pool, is close to the park, and the service is of a high standard. It would be better if the air quality could be improved.

The room is super big, the swimming pool is a bit small, but the water temperature is good, and there is a steaming and ice room in the changing room. It is recommended to put some spare towels. When swimming, the towel was placed on the recliner. After swimming, I found that a mother had used it for her child.
The expected number of people at the breakfast will inevitably lead to a less good experience, but overall it is still very satisfactory. It is recommended that the plate can be heated, because it is too cold and the food will quickly cool off.

advantage:
1. The lobby is very distinctive and Chinese style.
2. The room is well equipped. Duravit and Hansgrohe bathing equipment, KAPPA care solution. It is worthy of the brand to open in 2011.
3. The buffet launched a Halloween cake series. I was lucky to take pictures.
4. Good service. One is to upgrade the room, the other is to check out late, the third is to go out later after parking and check out, and the fourth is that the free bar coffee in the room is good.

shortcoming:
1. The garage guidelines are not good. Many of them are three-dimensional parking spaces.
2. I didn't see it in the lounge area in the lobby, and set up consumer seats.
3. Loan rooms and fitness areas of the hotel. One is that there is a confinement club on the executive floor, unfortunately one is next door (No. 1920); the other is that the swimming pool itself is very small, and there are coaches to take guests.

The suite room is large and the facilities are good. The 270 degree view is the creaking of the electric curtains when working. It needs to be pointed out that the floor service staff needs to be improved. Several times I went in and out and yelled directly, asking whether to check out (when I went downstairs for breakfast the next morning), and once asked if I could see her keys. The key is that the sound is too loud and can be heard on the entire floor.
In addition, the breakfast variety in the past was particularly rich. Now it may be affected by the epidemic, and the breakfast has shrunk a lot.

Larger rooms The hotel has a richer breakfast buffet. The restaurant is on the first floor lobby. The antique dining environment is also scrolled on the screen. Various ancient poems and songs combine modern technology and ancient literature.
Opposite the hotel is the Convention and Exhibition Center, and there are many good restaurants in Pudong Kerry City. Dining is very convenient. There is a food street in the hotel. There is a 24-hour family can buy snacks, and the hotel is also very convenient to order food.

Although the buffet at night did not let the children see the chef’s barbecue scene due to the influence of typhoon, it was still a satisfying meal. The front-line depar**ent of the hotel made me feel the warm service again, especially the warm and friendly smile of Jessica Zhang at the front desk, which made my children very happy and screaming to come!

Wendy at the front desk kindly checked in for me. Knowing that I am an old customer, he asked her for any needs or suggestions for improvement at any time.
The Himalaya Center, where the Himalaya Hotel is located, is a comprehensive shopping mall with a strong artistic a**osphere. It looks pos**odernist on the outside, like a reinforced cave with alien temperament. It's more like an art museum. Friends who like to take pictures can use their imagination to take pictures with a unique feeling.
There are several boutique restaurants in the hotel itself. I once bought a package of that kind. I brought my family or invited customers and friends to dinner on weekends. Staying by myself, I also like to eat out. There is an expo plaza opposite the main entrance of the hotel on Meihua Road. There are various small restaurants, several nice small cafes, several well-known milk tea shops, and two convenience stores. Walking along Meihua Road is a row of friendly restaurants. The Kerry Center Building is on the right front of the hotel’s gate. There are some more high-end hotels in style and price. In the Himalaya Center where the hotel is located, there are also mid- to high-end restaurants. However, I often visit the cinema inside. The facilities and environment are good. There is also a nightclub in the Himalaya Center, which looks good.
Coming to the hotel for the weekend is a lazy rhythm. In the afternoon, I lay in the hotel and played the drama. The bathroom glass wall has a print of the artistic conception of snow-capped mountains. There are coffee machines and frozen drinks, which provide a quiet a**osphere.
Go to the pool after dinner. The gym, swimming pool and SPA are in a ring. In the middle of the ring is a circular courtyard. Looking up to the sky, it is a circular sky, and words are echoed. It really feels like a place of practice.
The next day I woke up and ate breakfast in the hotel leisurely, went for a swim, did it, and changed clothes in the bathing pool, ice room and sauna. I got sleepy again, went back to the room and slept, got up and drank coffee. I feel refreshed and ready to welcome the new week

msg:The facilities are dirty and old + poor sanitation + service is as bad as a horror. The most impressive thing about this hotel is the serious accumulation of stains in the bathroom facilities, the narrow and sticky walls of the shower, and the leaky ceiling shower. The room is made up of uneven and hard pillows with holes and collapsed mattresses. Coupled with the light-leaking curtains, I slept for 8 hours with a sore back, and it was even far worse than the sofa at home. The lobby of the hotel is dimly lit, and a large number of places in the center are all designated as consumer areas. When checking in, guests can only grab the two poor places on the corners. After I got the room card, one of them became invalid. I went to the front desk and asked three questions. I didn't know if I was a new one to activate the room card, so that the guests would wait there. From 12 o'clock the next day, the front desk made several phone calls like a urging ghost to urge to check out. The tone was very bad and he even knocked on the door. I have stayed in many five-star hotels across the country and none of the services are so bad. Finally, I even called my phone at 2:50 and called me by my name, threatening to inform me that if I checked out later than 3, they would charge a half-day room charge. This is really outrageous! I have never experienced such an unfriendly, terrible, and disrespectful service attitude to guests. This is undoubtedly the worst five-star hotel in Shanghai, far from the price he marked, and the stay is intuitive The feeling is that the rest facilities are unfriendly, the rooms are old and lack maintenance and the bad attitude of the service staff. The service staff’s nasty tone like a urging ghost just wanted to drive all the guests away as soon as possible.

Hotel decoration and room hardware configuration are general, gym swimming pool is open to the public, fitness equipment is complete, the swimming pool is small, many nearby children learn to swim here, the swimming pool is more suitable for teaching children to learn to swim, breakfast and dinner buffets are less variety, ingredients are common, dinner A few lamb skewers and beef skewers have to be lined up at the buffet. After a while, I turn around and no one is grilling. Fortunately, there are two chicken wings...The carpet on the coffee table in the room looks dirty. It's easy to be hygienic.

The five-star evaluation is what we say, but there is one thing to say, maybe the child is too timid, the room lights at night It was too dark, coupled with the decoration style of the hotel, the child was a little scared at night, went to Mi Restaurant for dinner at 8pm, and strayed into the banquet hall on the third floor, empty, so scared that the child hid in his arms and refused to look up, so was Mi Restaurant The lights are dim, but fortunately there are a lot of people

The exterior wall of the hotel is a bit old, part of it is Gaudí style. The breakfast is specially served outdoors. The breakfast is complete. In fact, there are not many breakfasts in the hotel. Anyway, I will eat a few of them. The key is to taste authentic. The bittern of the noodles here is good.

The interior decoration is pretty good, with a sense of design. The room is very large, upgraded to the executive room 2028, the view on the 20th floor is good.
The room facilities are all necessary, and the executive lounge service attitude is also very good. Plush toys are also given.
The gym is relatively large, the swimming pool is not bad, and you can swim comfortably for a few laps.

Check in 辦完直接給妳一張房卡告知樓層就沒了，沒有主動說明酒店環境設施、購買的套餐內容等等，大部分都要自己詢問。

無法接受的衛生環境，餐廳桌子會有水漬、椅子像從來沒清過有污漬碎屑，取餐盤有積水、廚師帶著藍色手套撿地上垃圾後去切麵包、餐具時常不齊全。

自助早晚餐食物一般般，稱不上美味，會每天更換一些菜色。

房間挺大，都有浴缸可以泡澡。

室內地下停車場很大，住宿停車免費，離場時跟前台報備一下車號，15分鐘內需要離場。

就服務素質來説，前台和客房的服務人員都不錯。但是本次又在6樓“迷”餐廳吃了一次飯，這個服務真是個迷，雖然大部分員工是ok的，但是個別服務人員在背後嚼舌根這種行為真的很下頭。
另外是早餐廳，場面的大小和佈置的有種全季的即視感，種類少，菜品冷，在蛋區要了份炒蛋，頭天一個女員工還在指導下勉強做了出來，第二天的員工直接告訴我沒有炒蛋這個選項。。。
另外房間設施維護的也不好，門鎖經常碰到出門關不上的情況，叫了工程師來也未完全解決；房間空調温度較低，且無法上調，對生病期間的住客不是十分友好。

msg:如果用一個四字詞來形容這次出行的話，一定是：一塌糊塗。
入住：我們特地避開高峯，三點半快四點到酒店的，房間還是沒有準備好，前台説親子房需要佈置一下，等佈置好會打我電話，一直等到了6點多，還是沒有來電話，才去前台問，前台説正準備打電話給我…這也就算了，套餐裏送的東西一樣也沒有和我説…也是我後面想起來，下樓去問他們的。
晚餐：人非常多，現場也很混亂，説是壽喜鍋自助餐，牛肉一共就上了兩次吧，完全沒有服務，肉催了半個小時才來，東西並不好吃，更不要説什麼M7-M8了，完全沒看到。
第二天：明明在攜程上定的是兩晚，衹不過是分兩個訂單，第一天入住的時候前台也是知道我們訂了兩晚，但第二天就發現我的房卡開不了門了…問了服務人員，服務人員要我們自己去走廊打電話給前台，前台竟然叫我自己下去重新弄房卡，於是衹能讓爸媽在走廊等着，我穿着短袖拖鞋下樓去前台弄房卡，這個服務簡直離譜，難道不能先安排工作人員來開房門，再下去補辦嗎？真的有考慮顧客的感受嗎？ 當然下樓重新辦卡的時候，前台仍然是對套餐裏的內容衹字未提，當我説起是不是有下午茶和娃娃機幣的時候才想起來要給我……
服務： 這個酒店最差的地方就是服務了
1. 定了個蛋糕問前台是否有冰箱可以放一下，前台説沒有，再詢問時，告訴我我可以自己去三樓餐廳問，彷彿他們不是一家酒店的。
2. 生日入住沒有任何upgrade，而且是前台人員讓我報了生日的情況下哦（anyway這也就算了～
3. 第二天沒有cleaning，我打電話需要三雙拖鞋（因為穿着拖鞋上上下下很多次了，拖鞋已經很臟了）客服竟然先回我房間裏有三雙的，我説今天沒有cleaning所以沒有更新過，她才説讓我稍等，讓清潔人員過來，然後讓我和清潔人員説。
4. 同行的兩個大人帶了一個一歲多的小朋友，想多加一床被子，服務人員説沒有。
5. 房間衞生間的玻璃移門是壞的，無法關上。
總結： 酒店應該就是為了旁邊展覽館服務的，形同快捷酒店而不是度假酒店，不會再來住了。

自助晚餐種類挺少的，個人感覺對不起這個價格，小龍蝦就一種口味，酒香的……對當天開車來回用餐的人士不太友好，火鍋的肉不是自取的，也可以理解，畢竟怕客人盯着好的肉拿會比較浪費，第一次上的還可以，後面再讓服務員加的肉，等級越來越低，口感也不太好，好像是從M8開始一點點往下上的，所以基本上各個品種就出現一次……
早餐的種類也很少……
房間中規中矩，我們去的時候停車挺緊張的……

走進酒店大堂，像走進了一個小吃市場，都找不到前台。給了17樓的二間房，覺得層高低矮，堂堂五星酒店，房間裏竟沒有地毯，窗户是落地的，但窗户上方一大塊是封閉的，光線幽暗。整個房間顯得陰暗侷促，設施老舊。套餐包含一個下午茶，我們前去時被告知查不到，打電話到前台，前台又説我們的房間是一個根本不認識的人訂定的。費盡周折，最後以一個完全陌生的人的名義，吃上了下午茶。自助火鍋也很勉強，説是M5M6和牛暢吃，那一盤也就是一口二口的量，我們四大一小吃，續了一次，都不好意思再點了。最後退房，在攜程定的房，我從來都是閃退的。在這裏就是不行，非得查完房才能走。
喜馬拉雅酒店，你拖了卓美亞的後腿，我來了一次，絕對不會來第二次了。（實在沒興趣拍照片，視頻，抱歉了）

電話客房服務需要送一雙拖鞋，等到第二天也沒有送來；最奇葩的是衞生間與房間的玻璃沒有轉換磨砂玻璃功能，洗澡一覽無遺！我就好奇如果是關係普通的同事要求出差一間標房會不會無比尷尬…
配不上卓美亞這個title，這個房價和實際體驗並不匹配。

因為是國慶假期、人流量比較大，在辦理入住手續時，遇到插隊現象，前台沒有制止並且給予辦理、讓自覺排長隊的住客有點不滿情緒。
游泳池和健身房都配備，但是游泳池人太多、服務上就有些鬆懈，特別是健身房的教練、態度就不是很友好了，對於第一次的小白來説、教練就有點不耐煩了。

首先服務來説，放假做了升級，確實很感謝，房間變大非常滿意。但是內設有點陳舊了，而且光線不足。
然後餐廳用餐，以前好吃的牡丹蝦沒有了，改成了日式壽喜鍋，份量是挺足…但是服務員不太專業，鍋底也很淡，食材出了牛肉都看着色麪一般。
最後有點奇葩的是：國慶節外觀牆是沒有開燈？還是原本就沒有燈？這點真的挺疑惑的。
前台服務和客房服務都很好，衹有我之前最喜歡的餐廳！讓我沒有再想去住的沖動！
好想盡快全球疫情好轉！能再去杜拜的卓美亞酒店羣小住呀

msg:國慶節假日出行，市中心的酒店價格比郊區給力很多。
當時考慮了世博洲際，但是床太窄了，帶孩子沒辦法睡，放棄。浦東嘉裏呢價格小貴，親子酒店節假日普遍漲價。作為設計師酒店商務型酒店，價格就親民了。
10.1入住，11點多還沒什麼人，很速度，等下午再看前台人就非常多了。攜程白金客户面子大吧，升級了行政房。雙床是1.5米，可以拼在一起，不擔心兩個寶寶掉下去。贊
行政房面積大，沙發床都可以睡倆人了。還有茶桌，很舒服。迷你吧免費，蘋果汁橙汁啤酒。
床有點軟，年紀大的不適合，我們中年人都有些不適應，也許是因為帶孩子睡太累，也可能不是床軟的問題。
早餐中規中矩，沒有顯得特別擁擠，外面還可以搭出來，小風吹吹很舒服。
游泳池嘛節假日就崩潰了，我們就10.1上午區游泳，後面不敢去，下餃子。身體有寒氣推薦去更衣室的小温泉，泡一會，很舒服。
周邊出行梅花路非常多吃的，嘉裏中心也可以帶娃溜起來，從地鐵裏走過去就行，不吹風不着雨的

空調温度不能調節，師傅來修之後屋裡開始巨大的味道，然後夜裡11點換房間，第二天一早不到9點我們都還在屋裡睡覺，服務員自己開門進來了……真心無語，快捷酒店都沒遇到過服務員一大早開門就進的情況，就這價格，這酒店真的夠了

msg:預售買的，接待能力有限，套餐中的下午茶、晚餐、早餐都很普通。因為是商務型酒店，本沒想會有嬰兒床，就順口問了句前台，前台讓我進房間打電話問，進房間打電話，接線員語氣十分敷衍，我問的每一句話，她都像要把我的話塞回我嘴裏一樣快速且決絕，雖無一個臟字兒，但感受度極差。。。所以整體感受下來，酒店非常一般，如果接待能力有限，可以限制下預售券的銷售。

msg:首先和前台確認有沒有預訂成功，對方就很不情願，不耐煩🙄，要是在現場估計能看見她的上翻白眼球，其次因為我訂錯房間想升級套房，酒店有很多空間就是不願意給升級，加錢升級還得是按照前台原價收取，衹能去聯繫攜程，攜程聯繫代理機構電話一直沒人接……前台又不給做處理，衹認原價訂房，同時發票什麼開都不知道🤷♀️另外酒店前台不接受預訂，衹能在攜程預訂，並且不能取消，確定好了不入住也是全額收取費用，讓攜程客服和酒店溝通，電話就不接，沒有一次打通的，衹能和前台溝通，前台服務人員我都不想説……做事情的態度太差了。房間裏沒抽紙，洗漱台有一個抽紙盒，就五張紙，你們打掃房間都不檢查嗎？水漬都不擦嗎？酒店早餐也不符合五星標準，太差勁了。第二天客人不舒服申請延遲退房，前台就不耐煩，唧唧歪歪説一大堆，很不情願給延遲退房……訂了這麼多酒店，第一次寫這麼長的評價，真無語，都説幹一行愛一行，我在你們身上完全沒看見5星級酒店的標準，最起碼的服務都做不好……白瞎了5🌟

msg:壓根不會推薦任何人住這家酒店，想了好幾天還是來評論一下。頁面標註的兩張雙人床，事實每張床衹有1.35米，標註的超大雙人床衹有一米八，訂房的時候我選擇的兩張雙人床，因為衹看了頁面沒看詳情，實際去看床特別小，我們三個大人一個小孩根本不夠住，協調退房，願意承擔一晚上費用，也不給我取消，你們酒店就靠我這幾天房費發財呢？真的是我入住所有酒店裡麪最噁心的了。
