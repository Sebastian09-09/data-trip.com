It's advertised as a five-star hotel, but the rooms are poorly cleaned, and the breakfast is very ordinary. It's a bit outrageous to charge half price for 110 children. Most stores only start charging 120. The restaurant may be crowded during holidays, so the staff did not bother to clean it up. There were small paper balls and other garbage everywhere on the floor. The quality of the dishes can be seen in the pictures!

The toilet was also blocked, so I had to ask someone to go to the room to flush it. There are not many types of food in the buffet. The pork chops and fish are fried and put aside. The food tastes cold. There are only a few hot spring pools in such a big hotel, and there are no entertainment facilities in the hotel. It's not fun to soak in the hot spring and then go back to sleep. The most important thing is that the service attitude of the hotel staff is not very good. They have an attitude that annoys me even if I ask more questions, which makes me lose my mood to play! A very bad experience!

The room was quite decent, with boogers and dust on the bedside screen. The room facilities were mediocre and the walls were moldy. I wanted to make tea and asked for a few more bottles of mineral water, but I was charged for it. I stayed in so many hotels and there were drinks with marked prices. I asked for 2 more bottles.

msg:The experience is not good. I checked in at around 3pm and the water temperature in the private pool was too hot at 56 degrees. How could I take a dip? There was no cold hot spring to add, so we had to wait until we could take a dip. It was already midnight, so we had no choice but to add tap water, but the water was impure and rather turbid. It is suggested that the hotel should solve this problem and add cold hot springs. The room was too small and old. There was too little mineral water, only 2 small bottles. After soaking in the hot spring, there was not enough to drink. The boiled water was too hot. It’s time for new towels and robes. A room worth more than 1,000 yuan is not worth it. Buffet dinner and breakfast had nothing to eat. Anyway, I won’t go there again.

The hotel has a sense of age. The rooms are quite large, the environment is okay, the hygiene is average, and the facilities are very average.

There is a children's entertainment area downstairs, but the room does not have matching toothbrushes for children, and there is not even basic disposable sanitary cushions (now even simple apar**ents have it, let alone such a star resort)

Breakfast is average and quite expensive

Hot spring experience: ❌❌❌
The environment is acceptable among the many hot spring hotels in Fengshun, but the free hot spring in the room can only be entered and exited once. Unlike other hot spring hotels where you can enter unlimited times, this is very unfriendly.

There is a large shallow swimming pool. There is no deep swimming pool. You can only soak in the hot springs, but not swim.

The children's paddling pool is pitifully shallow and not much fun.

The toiletries in the shower room are not complete. The conditioner box is just a decoration and is completely empty. The shower head is a top-spray type and it is not easy to wash your hair at all.

2. Breakfast and dinner are also extremely perfunctory. It is recommended to eat outside the hotel.
3. The hot spring is okay
4. Others include the height limit for children of 1.1, and the extra charge for bath towels is also a poor experience.

Secondly, the children also have a great time with the various soups in the public pool. The service in the public area is also very good. The ginger water is very good. Drink, the security is also very good, and the waiters are also very considerate and professional. Let’s talk about the problem again. As the nearest hot spring to Chaoshan, I am the only one in the whole family who has never been to this hotel, who is not at home all year round, so I have heard about the “poor” service and hygiene, but I didn’t expect the hygiene in the room to be poor. At this point, the first thing I found when I went there was hair on the sofa, old water stains in all the toilets, a layer of dust on the table and bedside tables, the air conditioner was leaking, and one of the beds was soaked and no one could sleep on it. One person has to sleep on the sofa in the living room. Then there is the issue of replenishing bath towels. At the beginning, the front desk told me that only four pieces could be replenished for free. We were a group of eight adults and two children, which meant that there would be an extra fee for replenishing them. After I said that I wanted to complain, they replenished them for free. Secondly, when I passed by a Chinese restaurant, my mother and aunt asked some questions. The waiter in the Chinese restaurant was rude and ignored me. My mother even glared at me and I scolded her and apologized on the spot. At breakfast the next day, the same waiter The waiter said that we need to pay for a child. During my consultation and payment, her attitude was extremely impatient. I asked her why she had such an attitude. She said that she just looks like this. She also said that I was very strange and didn't know why she offended me. When I wanted to see what her name was, she quickly took off her name badge. Later, a manager came and I complained to the manager. Her attitude towards the manager was also extremely bad. It seemed that she was a related household. I couldn't see her first name, but she should have her last name. thunder. I left two pillowcases behind when I checked out. The front desk staff very enthusiastically asked for my address and mailed them to me. Thank you very much. To sum up, I hope that corresponding improvements can be made for bad hotels. All major platforms are complaining about your service. In my opinion, some rats spoiled the pot of porridge. My room fee is more than 5,000. Towel replacement requires extra money. Children Over 110, you need to make up for the breakfast, which looks too ugly and lacks any star quality. It is a sure profit to dominate such a good environment, but the corrupt management system and the inability to improve the service quality will definitely affect the reputation. The society is progressing and the surrounding B&Bs are rising. This hot spring water alone cannot retain people.

msg:儘管從梅州過來開了四五十公里山路很辛苦。但總體的講，這是一個很不錯的度假好去處，環境很棒，服務很好，小木屋的温泉池很大，公共温泉區也很不錯，晚上八點還有表演。

然而，不足之處也是比較多和明顯。

一，房間網絡非常非常非常差！

二，前台竟然把客人身份證打印出來給入住客人。這顯然很不合適。也是第一次見。很容易給客人造成訊息外泄和困擾。對客人的訊息保密，是酒店第一原則！

三，小木屋房間很小，沖涼房更是小得出奇。房間內甚至連張桌子都沒有，行李箱幾乎無處放。主要是房間地面有水時就變得特別滑，女兒因此摔了一跤。

四，餐廳無論早餐晚餐，菜的質量都比較差。

酒店配套是有五星級，但實際上不值得五星級。不過呢，應該還會再來。説這麼多是希望酒店會改進。

msg:不清楚這樣的酒店怎麼升到4.2分的，2.4分還差不多，還是因為温泉和環境加的分。住的套房，衞生條件直接看圖吧。吃早餐還吃出了蛋殼，重點來了，一個糯米燒麥裏吃出了蛋殼，這是為什麼？客房服務響應的特別慢。房間燈還有壞的，維護完全對不起這價位。熱水也是要放好久才能出來，也感覺不到是中央空調，基本沒有暖氣，雙面板調到暖風30℃，室內温度也就在20℃左右。温泉到還不錯，池子也多，水温基本都在37—42℃之間。找個池子仰頭看天還是不錯的，可以感受一份安靜。親親魚池和寶石浴完全就是免費的，但親親魚池基本沒開放，當然，你要闖進去也沒人管。所以建議想來的朋友，可以附近找一家相對便宜點的，然後買門票進入。最後大家如果不是自駕，那我還是勸退一波吧，美歐滴滴，沒有出租，沒有大巴，衹要你能想到的公共交通，啥都沒有，衹有電話約的私家送你，無論是汕頭市區還是揭陽市區，500起步。

剛進酒店遇到一個十幾個人的臨時團，四五個前台在那裡手忙腳亂又喊又叫，驗過綠碼排隊辦理入住又要驗，第一印象就極其不專業。
辦好入住到木屋途中經過兩次台階，對推行李箱的極其不友好，雖然是豪華木屋，但房間面積是真的小，硬裝也是舊得不行，感覺比某些品牌連鎖酒店都次啊！
温泉方面，加温要打電話給前台，服務員從房間穿過到外邊開水龍頭，自己看温度夠了再次致電同樣的操作再來一次，感覺真的賊落後！排水也不暢，水剛到温度就從池子裏滿出來了！當然温泉還是不錯的！
自助餐方面，我們是包含的早晚餐，晚餐記得是5.30開始，菜品都是一些家常菜，早點去是大椒鹽蝦，吃着想再加點回去就換成水煮蝦了！牛排去晚了也換豬排，最後衹有雞排！針不戳！
挑了這麼多刺，硬件方面不投資是沒辦法了，但服務上希望能專業點，讓我們對外也能更好地宣傳家鄉的項目景點
